 The following is a conversation with Vitalik Buterin, his second time in the podcast.

00:05.260 --> 00:10.760
 Vitalik is the cofounder of Ethereum and one of the most influential people in cryptocurrency

00:10.760 --> 00:13.400
 and technology broadly defined.

00:13.400 --> 00:20.060
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon, Indeed, ForSigmatic and Better

00:20.060 --> 00:21.060
 Help.

00:21.060 --> 00:24.320
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:24.320 --> 00:29.640
 As a side note, let me say that Ethereum, Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies have

00:29.640 --> 00:35.140
 been taking a wild ride of prices going up and down in the past few months.

00:35.140 --> 00:41.240
 To me, the prices were never as important as the ideas, both technical and philosophical.

00:41.240 --> 00:45.640
 Cryptocurrency has the potential to empower billions of people to participate in a global

00:45.640 --> 00:50.920
 economy in a way that resists the manipulation by centralized power.

00:50.920 --> 00:57.080
 Also with smart contracts, Layer 2 technologies, data pools, NFTs and of course integration

00:57.080 --> 01:02.200
 of artificial intelligence into the whole thing, we have the opportunity to build tools

01:02.200 --> 01:08.200
 and worlds that transform physical and digital life as we know it, hopefully minimizing the

01:08.200 --> 01:12.600
 suffering in the world and maximizing the fun.

01:12.600 --> 01:19.680
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Vitalik Buterin.

01:19.680 --> 01:27.560
 Let's first talk about Shiba Inu, if we can, also known as Shiba Token, Code SHIB.

01:27.560 --> 01:34.360
 For contact, Shiba Inu was created in August 2020, modeled off of Doshcoin by the anonymous

01:34.360 --> 01:37.360
 founder known as Riyoshi.

01:37.360 --> 01:47.000
 On May 10th this year, it had a market capitalization of over 13 billion and maybe you can explain

01:47.000 --> 01:54.520
 this, but in a crazy move, you were given half of SHIB's total supply.

01:54.520 --> 02:05.720
 You burned, a.k.a. destroyed 90% of it, that's worth $6.7 billion and you donated 10%, that's

02:05.720 --> 02:14.880
 worth $1.2 billion at the time to an India COVID 19 relief fund, saying you don't want

02:14.880 --> 02:18.000
 to be the locus of this much power.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.960
 This is fascinating.

02:20.960 --> 02:27.240
 Why and how were you able to walk away from this much money and this much power?

02:27.240 --> 02:33.720
 I should probably start by giving some of the backstory around these coins and this concept

02:33.720 --> 02:36.720
 of giving me coins.

02:36.720 --> 02:40.680
 First of all, Shiba Inu, as you said, is this knockoff of Doshcoin.

02:40.680 --> 02:48.240
 Doshcoin was this initial kind of fund coin that was created back around 2014 or so.

02:48.240 --> 02:52.080
 It was just created by Jackson Palmer and put it out as a joke for a couple of hours

02:52.080 --> 02:55.320
 in a community formed around it.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.600
 At the beginning, people didn't take it very seriously.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.400
 I actually remember putting about $25,000 into Dosh sometime around 2016.

03:02.400 --> 03:09.000
 I just remember thinking to myself, okay, how am I going to explain to my mom that I

03:09.000 --> 03:12.840
 just invested $25,000 into dog coins?

03:12.840 --> 03:14.200
 What even are dog coins?

03:14.200 --> 03:19.080
 The only interesting thing about this coin is that there's a logo of a dog somewhere.

03:19.080 --> 03:24.000
 Of course, that ended up being one of the best investments I've ever made.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
 It did really well.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.560
 Then at the end of 2020, Elon Musk, of course, started talking about Doshcoin and the market

03:31.560 --> 03:36.240
 cap just shot up to about $50 billion.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.880
 It shot up multiple times.

03:37.880 --> 03:43.440
 The first time, it went up from about 0.8 cents to about $0.7 cents, and this just happened

03:43.440 --> 03:44.440
 all in one day.

03:44.440 --> 03:53.040
 I remember this was when I was still in Singapore in the middle of COVID, and I saw that the

03:53.040 --> 04:00.000
 price just went up by 1,000%, and I was like, oh, my God, my doge is worth a lot.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.440
 I immediately called up some of my friends and told them to drop everything in scramble.

04:05.440 --> 04:12.200
 Then I just sold half the doge, and I got $4.3 million donated the proceeds to give directly.

04:12.200 --> 04:16.520
 A few hours after I did this, the price dropped back down from about $0.07 to $0.04.

04:16.520 --> 04:21.280
 I managed to sell the doge at the top, and I remember just feeling like I was such an

04:21.280 --> 04:22.280
 amazing trader.

04:22.280 --> 04:27.840
 Then, of course, the price went up from $0.04, then to $0.07, and then $0.50.

04:27.840 --> 04:32.880
 Doge becoming this big phenomenon where there's even a lot of people that have heard of doge

04:32.880 --> 04:37.440
 or should have not heard of Ethereum is just something even I wasn't predicting.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.680
 After that, of course, we have doge, and then people are thinking, well, if the leading

04:41.680 --> 04:47.760
 doge token is worth $50 billion, then surely the second largest doge token deserves at

04:47.760 --> 04:50.080
 least $7 or $8 billion.

04:50.080 --> 04:55.000
 I feel like that's what the mindset of these Shiba people is.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
 Then, of course, they did this other gimmick where they gave me half the Shiba token supply.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.480
 They were actually not the first projects to do this.

05:04.480 --> 05:10.320
 Around the end of 2020, there was this weird project called Teller.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.520
 I think they're a chain link competitor or something like this.

05:13.520 --> 05:19.080
 I remember they just dumped $50,000 worth of their token into my wallet, and then they

05:19.080 --> 05:23.360
 had their TwitterRB basically run around saying, look, look at Vitalik's wallet.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.360
 Vitalik holds Tellers.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.360
 He's one of us.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.360
 He's a supporter.

05:26.360 --> 05:32.440
 As soon as I discovered this, I just publicly sold the Teller tokens on you to swap.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.080
 This created a bit of a Twitter splat.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.920
 The Shiba people were more clever.

05:36.920 --> 05:42.280
 The Shiba people, instead of dumping to that wallet, they dumped to my cold wallet.

05:42.280 --> 05:46.840
 In cryptocurrency, there's this concept of cold wallets and hot wallets.

05:46.840 --> 05:53.000
 The thing that actually owns your money is this 80 digit number called a private key.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.720
 The hot wallet is when that private key is just stored in memory on your computer, on

05:56.720 --> 05:59.120
 your phone, really easy to access.

05:59.120 --> 06:04.680
 Cold wallet means it's either written down on a piece of paper or it's on a computer

06:04.680 --> 06:07.440
 that's just never accessed the internet.

06:07.440 --> 06:11.040
 Cold is very inconvenient, but cold is also much more secure.

06:11.040 --> 06:15.960
 Even if that computer has some viruses on it, it's air gapped.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.120
 It's not actually going to be able to upload it.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.320
 This cold wallet and all the money's out of the cold wallet, so it's safe for me to talk

06:23.320 --> 06:24.600
 about my setup now.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.040
 It was a laptop that was sitting in Canada.

06:28.040 --> 06:34.080
 I also had two pieces of paper where I wrote down two numbers on those two pieces of paper.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.040
 One was with me, one was in Canada.

06:36.040 --> 06:39.440
 If you add those two numbers together, you get the private key.

06:39.440 --> 06:44.520
 Because of COVID travel restrictions, this cold wallet's in Canada.

06:44.520 --> 06:48.600
 It's very difficult for me to actually access it.

06:48.600 --> 06:53.440
 I'm not sure if they knew this, maybe they just got lucky, but basically they sent a

06:53.440 --> 07:00.840
 lot of these dog tokens into this wallet where it was very difficult for me to access it.

07:00.840 --> 07:04.560
 I saw these dog tokens, I saw more and more people talking about them, and then at some

07:04.560 --> 07:10.640
 point I realized that these things are worth billions of dollars.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.280
 There's lots of really good things that you could do with that amount of money, and it

07:13.280 --> 07:16.960
 would actually be a waste to just see it go.

07:16.960 --> 07:23.160
 I made the decision that I would actually power through and figure out how to safely

07:23.160 --> 07:24.920
 basically get my private key.

07:24.920 --> 07:29.600
 I actually had to call up my family, tell them to read out their number off of their

07:29.600 --> 07:30.600
 piece of paper.

07:30.600 --> 07:35.480
 I entered that into a fresh laptop that I bought from Target.

07:35.480 --> 07:40.120
 Then I put in my other number on my piece of paper, added the two numbers together on

07:40.120 --> 07:42.680
 the computer, there's the key.

07:42.680 --> 07:47.480
 At the same time, just scrambled for two days, setting up a new wallet where I could move

07:47.480 --> 07:54.120
 my ETH to safely, getting people to be multisig partners, just doing all sorts of stuff that

07:54.120 --> 07:59.040
 10 years ago you would expect to just be part of a cyberpunk science fiction novel, but

07:59.040 --> 08:00.040
 now it's all real.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.440
 So you're doing this all by yourself, essentially?

08:03.440 --> 08:04.440
 Most of it by myself.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.280
 You have to keep it secret.

08:06.280 --> 08:12.640
 I needed my family to actually go and read the number on their piece of paper, and then

08:12.640 --> 08:20.440
 in my new multisig wallet, there's other people that are signatories, but I'm obviously

08:20.440 --> 08:23.160
 not going to reveal any details beyond that.

08:23.160 --> 08:29.400
 So I did this, and I actually managed to get the private key, make the first transaction

08:29.400 --> 08:35.280
 that would just move all my ETH to the multisig wallet so it's safe, and then put the private

08:35.280 --> 08:40.280
 key on my main computer, then started going in and just selling some of the dock tokens

08:40.280 --> 08:43.520
 and then just giving them to these different charities.

08:43.520 --> 08:50.040
 Now at the time, I actually did not even have any idea of how much you would be able to

08:50.040 --> 08:55.760
 get, because on paper, the dock tokens are $7 billion, but in reality, it's a very liquid

08:55.760 --> 08:56.760
 market.

08:56.760 --> 09:00.240
 Are you going to crash it after you sell 1 million worth?

09:00.240 --> 09:03.280
 Are you going to crash it after 10 million?

09:03.280 --> 09:06.720
 Might you actually be able to get an entire 200 million?

09:06.720 --> 09:08.880
 I had no idea.

09:08.880 --> 09:15.800
 So I definitely was just over the mindset, okay, I'll sell a bit, maybe I get some ETH,

09:15.800 --> 09:20.160
 and then donated some ETH to give well donated some to other groups, and then, okay, have

09:20.160 --> 09:21.160
 some dock tokens.

09:21.160 --> 09:25.160
 I don't have an easy ability to sell more myself, but then I'll just give them to these

09:25.160 --> 09:30.200
 groups and hopefully they'll do good things with them.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.160
 I actually donated at 20% and dumped 80%.

09:34.160 --> 09:40.600
 So the COVID India group got one batch and then there's another group that got another

09:40.600 --> 09:41.600
 batch.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.440
 I don't want to say who they are, because I think they want to announce themselves at

09:44.440 --> 09:45.440
 some point.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.440
 Sure.

09:46.440 --> 09:53.480
 But you can see the fact that these transactions were made on the blockchain, but it was just

09:53.480 --> 10:00.840
 very interesting and unexpected and just an insanely crazy situation.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.040
 It's been a couple of weeks.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.120
 First of all, thank you for helping me hang up some curtains.

10:06.120 --> 10:13.720
 This is a first for the podcast and shows that you're a truly a special person to be

10:13.720 --> 10:14.960
 willing to help.

10:14.960 --> 10:20.400
 But now, a couple of weeks later, do you regret any aspect of that decision?

10:20.400 --> 10:24.360
 I'm sure there are some things that I probably could have done better.

10:24.360 --> 10:30.360
 I was actually talking to some of these charities and I was impressed by just how much money

10:30.360 --> 10:33.000
 they managed to get out of selling some of these coins.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.960
 So I probably could have done better by just talking more with the traders and actually

10:38.960 --> 10:48.920
 ensuring that they can do a better job of maximizing the value of all of them.

10:48.920 --> 10:54.440
 But it was a very stressful time and I did have to act quickly.

10:54.440 --> 10:59.880
 I did manage to make a lot of the donations before, a few days before the great crypto

10:59.880 --> 11:01.320
 crash happened.

11:01.320 --> 11:09.000
 So it's difficult to, obviously, there's parallel universes in which I did better,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.720
 but at the same time, there's also lots of parallel universes where because I hesitated

11:13.720 --> 11:17.680
 more and tried to spend more time thinking I missed the opportunity.

11:17.680 --> 11:25.520
 So on that, it's like a luck of the draw and I'm just happy that everything was able

11:25.520 --> 11:27.360
 to turn out as well as it did.

11:27.360 --> 11:32.280
 But psychologically, you mentioned stress, how hard was it?

11:32.280 --> 11:33.280
 It was stressful, right?

11:33.280 --> 11:38.720
 I think, well, one of the really stressful parts was just the fact that I had to basically

11:38.720 --> 11:44.360
 move all of my funds, including the 325,000 ether from one cold wallet into another hot

11:44.360 --> 11:48.440
 wallet or sorry, into another multi sig wallet.

11:48.440 --> 11:51.120
 And maybe the multi sig wallet had a bug in it.

11:51.120 --> 11:56.360
 Maybe there's some mistake I'll make in the middle that causes the funds to get lost.

11:56.360 --> 12:01.800
 And that part was stressful and I was definitely stressing out for two days.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.640
 I mean, triple checking the new wallet, I even did a bit of an audit of the code myself.

12:05.640 --> 12:12.840
 I wrote my own JavaScript to DAP to make confirmations because Gnosis safe didn't work with the status

12:12.840 --> 12:14.120
 wallet well.

12:14.120 --> 12:19.480
 So that whole thing was definitely a bit of a marathon.

12:19.480 --> 12:27.640
 I was also definitely a bit worried about or uncertain, I guess, how the public and

12:27.640 --> 12:32.200
 including the coin community is what perceived the whole thing.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.520
 But I was actually impressed.

12:34.520 --> 12:43.560
 For every poster that was saying, no, why did Vitalik, like Ruggple on his wallet was supposed

12:43.560 --> 12:44.560
 to be a burn address.

12:44.560 --> 12:50.560
 There was like 10 people that were like, oh, I thought I was just in this because it's

12:50.560 --> 12:52.120
 a fun pyramid gambling thing.

12:52.120 --> 12:56.440
 But instead I ended up being part of this great public good thing for humanity.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.480
 And that's even more amazing.

12:58.480 --> 13:03.760
 So the amount of that that I got was very impressive.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.680
 So all in all, I think the doc people did great.

13:07.680 --> 13:08.680
 The doc people.

13:08.680 --> 13:14.480
 Is there something you can extend to the bigger picture of it in the principles you applied

13:14.480 --> 13:15.760
 to make in this decision?

13:15.760 --> 13:22.600
 Is there some principles, philosophies that you apply also to the decisions you make around

13:22.600 --> 13:24.800
 Ethereum?

13:24.800 --> 13:33.600
 I think a big one for me is just this idea that crypto isn't just an opportunity to

13:33.600 --> 13:38.160
 give people slightly better ways to save value in all of these things.

13:38.160 --> 13:45.160
 It's also an opportunity to basically create these new digital institutions that could

13:45.160 --> 13:47.920
 serve the public good in new ways.

13:47.920 --> 13:51.800
 And that's something that I've been interested in for a long time.

13:51.800 --> 13:57.680
 I actually even have this article in Bitcoin Magazine back in 2014 where I basically suggested

13:57.680 --> 14:03.160
 this idea that you would have coins that represent causes and people would just buy and accept

14:03.160 --> 14:05.520
 those coins because they support those causes.

14:05.520 --> 14:10.680
 So I think it's called markets, institutions, and currencies, a new form of social incentivization

14:10.680 --> 14:11.680
 or something like that.

14:11.680 --> 14:15.520
 And I'm sure you can find it in the links.

14:15.520 --> 14:20.000
 So that was interesting to kind of see becoming real.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.600
 In general, I think public goods are very important.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.880
 On the internet, public goods are even more important.

14:26.880 --> 14:32.600
 Every single experiment podcast is just on YouTube and anyone can go and see it.

14:32.600 --> 14:38.200
 There's no way for you to sell it so that some people can see it, but then other people

14:38.200 --> 14:39.200
 can't see it.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.880
 You could do that, but then you'd obviously be reducing your impact.

14:42.880 --> 14:48.240
 So thank you for making the amazing live experiment podcast so freely available.

14:48.240 --> 14:53.840
 Well, that's actually a tense thing is how do you do it in a way that's not controlled

14:53.840 --> 14:59.920
 in a centralized fashion because actually YouTube feels free and open, but it nevertheless

14:59.920 --> 15:02.600
 is one company making centralized decisions.

15:02.600 --> 15:09.240
 The first time I realized YouTube is not forever is when a lot of the Joe Rogan experience

15:09.240 --> 15:15.560
 library was pulled from YouTube as part of the Spotify deal and it made me realize we

15:15.560 --> 15:17.200
 need to...

15:17.200 --> 15:25.160
 It's like the realization that fiat money is centralized is realizing that this is not

15:25.160 --> 15:30.800
 forever and you might want to come up with schemes to distribute it, to decentralize

15:30.800 --> 15:34.800
 the control of it in a way that audio for podcasts is with just an RSS feed.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.300
 Exactly.

15:36.300 --> 15:42.320
 One of the philosophical things that I hope to achieve is decouple the concept of public

15:42.320 --> 15:47.520
 goods which are incredibly important and are the lifeblood of modern civilization from

15:47.520 --> 15:54.640
 the idea that there is or can be one central organization that represents the public and

15:54.640 --> 16:00.360
 perfectly understands and can impose their idea of what is the good.

16:00.360 --> 16:06.240
 When people talk about public goods, it just often comes with this baggage of either centralization

16:06.240 --> 16:09.800
 or conformism and I think it doesn't have to.

16:09.800 --> 16:15.600
 Often the most important public goods are the ones that are created by the crazy individualists

16:15.600 --> 16:19.000
 that disagree with everyone else.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.640
 Trying to make this kind of synthesis where you combine the values of decentralization

16:24.640 --> 16:32.000
 and the values of open source but you're not naive about it and you realize that for these

16:32.000 --> 16:36.120
 things to be produced, there needs to be a way for it to be sustainable.

16:36.120 --> 16:40.280
 There needs to be some way of supporting people who are working these projects but at the

16:40.280 --> 16:46.880
 same time you want to avoid that turning into a vector of centralization.

16:46.880 --> 16:51.000
 Trying to get all of the good things without the bad things.

16:51.000 --> 16:59.280
 To me, that's a big part of what my grand experiment in crypto is about.

16:59.280 --> 17:03.840
 We are doing things in different kinds of things for this.

17:03.840 --> 17:09.560
 The Gitcoin grants quadratic funding in the Ethereum ecosystem, there's obviously these

17:09.560 --> 17:18.480
 dog coins that just happens accidentally, there's other projects that, for example, Uniswap

17:18.480 --> 17:23.520
 has their Uniswap DAO that just has a huge amount of funding.

17:23.520 --> 17:28.440
 We haven't seen yet how that's going to be deployed but it could be potentially deployed

17:28.440 --> 17:31.720
 to do lots of really good and amazing things.

17:31.720 --> 17:41.120
 Do you see Ethereum as essentially a mechanism to fight for social causes?

17:41.120 --> 17:52.040
 I definitely see Ethereum as being a mechanism to fight for definitely some specific things

17:52.040 --> 18:00.680
 that are social causes, just the fact of creating an open financial system that anyone can participate

18:00.680 --> 18:02.440
 in no matter where they are in the world.

18:02.440 --> 18:08.080
 That's a social cause, just giving people the ability to organize and create projects

18:08.080 --> 18:11.200
 even if it's five people in five different countries.

18:11.200 --> 18:18.920
 That kind of inclusiveness, I think that's a social cause and it's a core crypto value.

18:18.920 --> 18:24.000
 But then at the same time, the other important part of the magic of Ethereum that you have

18:24.000 --> 18:30.400
 to balance that against is that it is also this open platform where ultimately the things

18:30.400 --> 18:35.920
 that are on Ethereum is just the things that the community makes of it.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.920
 Well, you briefly opened the door so let's go there.

18:38.920 --> 18:46.240
 When it comes to government regulation of crypto, what's the best case scenario?

18:46.240 --> 18:48.680
 What's the worst case scenario?

18:48.680 --> 18:56.960
 In terms of, as you've mentioned, Ethereum challenges the power centers of the world

18:56.960 --> 19:04.640
 and how do you see the interplay between governments and this new technology that resists centralized

19:04.640 --> 19:05.640
 power?

19:05.640 --> 19:09.200
 The best case and worst case.

19:09.200 --> 19:18.800
 The best case is that blockchains continue to prosper and we figure out scalability so

19:18.800 --> 19:24.680
 that people can actually start doing things on block, all of the amazing use cases that

19:24.680 --> 19:28.600
 people have been talking about instead of today where a lot of the great stuff gets

19:28.600 --> 19:32.240
 priced out because transaction fees are at $5 to $10.

19:32.240 --> 19:37.760
 And then we see a lot of different amazing applications happening on blockchains.

19:37.760 --> 19:45.000
 It could be DAOs creating new ways for people to interact and organize with each other,

19:45.000 --> 19:50.480
 new ways for artists to get funded and all sorts of these amazing things.

19:50.480 --> 19:58.280
 And there's just enough public support and just enough people that see that what crypto

19:58.280 --> 20:02.440
 is truly doing a lot of good things.

20:02.440 --> 20:08.400
 There are definitely areas where there's tensions, but in those areas where there's tensions,

20:08.400 --> 20:14.800
 there could be some kind of creative and interesting approaches that get figured out.

20:14.800 --> 20:21.040
 The concept of corporate taxes, for example, that would disappear as a revenue stream if

20:21.040 --> 20:23.880
 theoretically corporations just all get replaced by DAOs.

20:23.880 --> 20:35.360
 But maybe there's some other creative way by which DAOs themselves can have some kind

20:35.360 --> 20:41.920
 of encoded governance that ensures that they have at least some kind of bias towards serving

20:41.920 --> 20:45.040
 the global public good.

20:45.040 --> 20:50.280
 Maybe DAOs can do enough of that that people are happy with it.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.240
 There are going to be things that people are unhappy about.

20:52.240 --> 20:55.800
 There's always going to be the people that wants to surveil everyone.

20:55.800 --> 21:04.720
 But if the effect of crypto from just empowering people is greater than that and greater than

21:04.720 --> 21:09.320
 that in a way that people can just easily see, then that would be a good scenario.

21:09.320 --> 21:16.840
 And we'll just become incorporated and accept it the same way as happened with the internet.

21:16.840 --> 21:24.120
 But in the worst case scenario would, of course, be just people suddenly flipping and going

21:24.120 --> 21:30.240
 into moral panic mode and just, oh my god, this technology is used by insert bad group

21:30.240 --> 21:31.320
 over the day.

21:31.320 --> 21:37.280
 And then I don't think governments have the ability to ban crypto to the extent of just

21:37.280 --> 21:41.000
 preventing blockchains from existing, but they definitely have the ability to really

21:41.000 --> 21:42.760
 marginalize it.

21:42.760 --> 21:48.920
 If you just ban all exchanges and ban all links from the fiat ecosystem to crypto and

21:48.920 --> 21:56.880
 ban all mainstream employers from accepting or paying in cryptocurrency, then you can

21:56.880 --> 22:05.520
 successfully turn it into a fairly kind of niche countercultural thing that has much

22:05.520 --> 22:07.680
 less impact than otherwise would.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.600
 So it's somewhere between the good scenario and the bad scenario.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.120
 I'm obviously hoping for the good.

22:12.120 --> 22:17.920
 Well, that's interesting also the tension between governments and companies, like if

22:17.920 --> 22:22.120
 you have a bunch of billionaires or a bunch of companies like Tesla investing in Bitcoin

22:22.120 --> 22:24.760
 and then governments resisting that.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.920
 It's interesting who wins out in that worst case scenario.

22:27.920 --> 22:37.640
 And almost when companies and rich, quote unquote, respectable people embrace cryptocurrencies

22:37.640 --> 22:43.960
 Bitcoin, Ethereum, so on, even the dog coins, it's almost sends a signal to everybody else

22:43.960 --> 22:49.320
 that this is a revolution that's here to stay.

22:49.320 --> 22:55.000
 On this one little tangent that you brought up, this is almost an outdated idea, but it's

22:55.000 --> 23:01.200
 still with us, which is cryptocurrencies are used for illegal activity, for drugs, for crime

23:01.200 --> 23:03.040
 and so on.

23:03.040 --> 23:12.160
 Is there some sense that worries you that if cryptocurrency, if Ethereum runs the world,

23:12.160 --> 23:17.360
 then making money from crime will be easier?

23:17.360 --> 23:22.280
 There's always that possibility, but at the same time, I think if you look at the world

23:22.280 --> 23:28.480
 as a whole and the way all the other technological trends are going, in person surveillance is

23:28.480 --> 23:31.400
 just going up every year.

23:31.400 --> 23:35.720
 If you commit a crime in meat space, it's getting harder and harder to get away with

23:35.720 --> 23:38.640
 it.

23:38.640 --> 23:44.400
 If you want to do something, and this is something that's just happening as a result of better

23:44.400 --> 23:49.880
 technology and information transparency, a lot of it's hard to prevent even if you really

23:49.880 --> 23:50.880
 tried.

23:50.880 --> 24:01.760
 So, the world where things go dark as the police hawks sometimes like to say to such

24:01.760 --> 24:07.240
 an extent that, oh my God, the criminals are committing crimes with impunity and we can't

24:07.240 --> 24:08.240
 see anything.

24:08.240 --> 24:18.400
 That just seems unlikely, but on the other hand, the world where there just is no privacy,

24:18.400 --> 24:28.800
 for example, or the world where there just is no ability to act outside of the confines

24:28.800 --> 24:35.800
 of mainstream institutions, that's something that's more realistic and that seems like

24:35.800 --> 24:41.480
 something that could lead to a lot of scary things.

24:41.480 --> 24:45.800
 Even from a government's point of view, governments over the last few years, a lot of them, they're

24:45.800 --> 24:54.000
 very worried about sovereignty, they're worried about if their country's economy is in social

24:54.000 --> 24:58.080
 environments, they're just completely dependent on basically foreign tech companies controlled

24:58.080 --> 24:59.920
 by foreign governments.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.240
 Governments are not on team government.

25:01.240 --> 25:07.120
 It's like the Indian government is on team India, the Russian government is on team Russia

25:07.120 --> 25:09.480
 and so forth.

25:09.480 --> 25:15.080
 They don't want the US to be able to have this big backdoor into everything.

25:15.080 --> 25:27.760
 So I do think that a balance is needed, but at the same time, I do think, I guess I definitely

25:27.760 --> 25:37.960
 worry more about the possibility that just without things to like crypto, acting outside

25:37.960 --> 25:42.760
 of institutions becomes too impossible and I don't even necessarily mean outside of governments,

25:42.760 --> 25:46.480
 but just outside of corporations becomes too impossible and there's just terrible things

25:46.480 --> 25:48.960
 that come as a result.

25:48.960 --> 25:56.000
 Things going in the other direction, it obviously is a risk, but at the same time, I think in

25:56.000 --> 26:02.800
 the long term, a crypto can potentially even offer defenses as much as a tax against that

26:02.800 --> 26:03.800
 sort of thing.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.800
 Yeah.

26:04.800 --> 26:08.720
 Throughout history, many of the most destructive things came from centralized institutions

26:08.720 --> 26:15.320
 versus sort of from the people operating in the shadows and I've been talking to a bunch

26:15.320 --> 26:21.480
 of psychedelics folks that people doing researches like Rick Doblin in Johns Hopkins, there's

26:21.480 --> 26:26.280
 a lot of exciting research on psychedelics and one thing you could say about operating

26:26.280 --> 26:33.880
 at the edge of legality, it could actually accelerate the adoption of particular things

26:33.880 --> 26:39.320
 like whether it's marijuana or psychedelics, they can help people out.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.560
 It almost accelerates the policy.

26:41.560 --> 26:45.880
 It forces the policy to catch up to where the people stand, so there's a positive way

26:45.880 --> 26:51.160
 of doing things that are in the gray area of legality and creating a market that allows

26:51.160 --> 26:57.120
 people to in a safe way be able to participate in this gray area of legality.

26:57.120 --> 27:01.800
 The other thing to keep in mind, of course, is that the set of the kinds of things that

27:01.800 --> 27:06.800
 just payment processors as companies try to restrict people you from is much larger than

27:06.800 --> 27:09.120
 the set of things that's illegal.

27:09.120 --> 27:12.800
 Part of that is because they want to be super conservative and the more layers you have,

27:12.800 --> 27:17.440
 the more they're conservative because they're scared of what the layer below them will do

27:17.440 --> 27:19.400
 to them.

27:19.400 --> 27:23.160
 Sometimes they have their own moral opinions of various kinds.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.560
 They go after lots of people.

27:24.560 --> 27:30.440
 They make life really hard for sex workers, for example, psychedelics as you mentioned.

27:30.440 --> 27:38.160
 There's a lot of activity, including stuff that is totally legal, that just there's

27:38.160 --> 27:45.600
 this shadow paypal credit card government or whatever you want to call it that makes

27:45.600 --> 27:48.080
 it just hard to participate in this stuff.

27:48.080 --> 27:54.160
 I think reducing the number of intermediaries is definitely normally a good thing.

27:54.160 --> 28:01.920
 All right, let's talk about one of the most exciting technologies, like technically, philosophically,

28:01.920 --> 28:09.320
 like socially, financially in every way, which is Ethereum 2.0.

28:09.320 --> 28:13.760
 There's a million things to talk about, but at the step one is probably a good thing to

28:13.760 --> 28:19.760
 do, which is can you briefly summarize your vision, how Ethereum 2.0 will make Ethereum

28:19.760 --> 28:23.160
 more scalable, secure, and sustainable?

28:23.160 --> 28:24.480
 Sure.

28:24.480 --> 28:30.920
 I think recently we've actually been kind of deemphasizing the ETH 2.0 branding, I guess.

28:30.920 --> 28:35.920
 The reason behind that was that originally we envisioned something more like a big grand

28:35.920 --> 28:42.000
 event where all the good things would happen at the same time, and it would be a new blockchain,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.880
 and it would be a new protocol, and people would have to take a lot of effort to migrate

28:45.880 --> 28:46.880
 over.

28:46.880 --> 28:54.160
 Later, we've slowly changed the roadmap over to something that's much more incremental.

28:54.160 --> 28:57.640
 Proof of stake happens kind of over time, and then charting gets added over time, and

28:57.640 --> 28:59.920
 all these features get added over time.

28:59.920 --> 29:04.600
 The experience for just a regular Ethereum user still feels very seamless.

29:04.600 --> 29:09.680
 It's maybe a little bit more complex than the hard forks that we've already done from

29:09.680 --> 29:14.720
 a user's point of view, but not by that much.

29:14.720 --> 29:20.600
 The big two things that are happening, these are what used to be considered the two flagship

29:20.600 --> 29:26.560
 features of ETH 2.0, and now they're just the flagship features of the next evolution

29:26.560 --> 29:31.760
 of Ethereum, as proof of stake and charting.

29:31.760 --> 29:38.360
 Proof of stake is a consensus mechanism, I should say.

29:38.360 --> 29:44.560
 The difference is that an algorithm is something that you run by yourself, a mechanism as interactions

29:44.560 --> 29:49.280
 between people, and it could even include incentives and all of that.

29:49.280 --> 29:57.240
 You can sense this mechanism by which nodes in the network agree on which blocks came

29:57.240 --> 29:59.880
 in, which transactions came in, and what order.

29:59.880 --> 30:04.160
 Make sure that once a block gets accepted, it can't get reverted, and all of these things

30:04.160 --> 30:07.320
 that we expect from a blockchain.

30:07.320 --> 30:10.960
 Existing blockchains, including Bitcoin, including the Ethereum of today, and including

30:10.960 --> 30:13.800
 a lot of them, the use proof of work.

30:13.800 --> 30:22.160
 So, the reason why we need proof of anything is because they serve this function that I

30:22.160 --> 30:26.000
 call an economic civil resistance.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.320
 That's obviously a big word, especially if you've never heard of civil as before.

30:31.320 --> 30:35.240
 The basic idea is that you have a network and you have lots of computers that agree

30:35.240 --> 30:39.400
 on which blocks you accept, and sometimes you get two blocks that get published at the

30:39.400 --> 30:41.680
 same time, and you just have to agree on an order.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.280
 There has to be some kind of voting game.

30:44.280 --> 30:47.920
 But then the question is, well, in this voting game, who gets to vote?

30:47.920 --> 30:50.120
 Who gets to participate?

30:50.120 --> 30:52.080
 You can't say one person, one vote.

30:52.080 --> 30:56.480
 The reason why you cannot say one person, one vote is because you need some kind of

30:56.480 --> 31:01.920
 authority or some kind of mechanism to say who the humans are.

31:01.920 --> 31:06.120
 If you don't have that, then a bad guy could just come in with a virtual machine or with

31:06.120 --> 31:11.320
 a computer that has on it 10 billion virtual machines that have 10 billion virtual nodes,

31:11.320 --> 31:16.520
 and then just say, look, I'm 99% of the network, I should control everything.

31:16.520 --> 31:22.040
 To prevent this, what proof of work and proof of stake both do is they basically say, well,

31:22.040 --> 31:28.280
 the weight of your vote, how much influence your votes have in the consensus, is proportional

31:28.280 --> 31:32.040
 to what quantity of economic resources you bring in.

31:32.040 --> 31:36.060
 In the case of proof of work, you prove what economic resources you have because your economic

31:36.060 --> 31:40.320
 resources are computers, and you prove that you have them by just running them 24 seven

31:40.320 --> 31:43.480
 using these hash algorithms.

31:43.480 --> 31:49.040
 This does solve the problem because in order to attack the network, you have to come in

31:49.040 --> 31:54.360
 with more computers and more money invested into computers and electricity than the rest

31:54.360 --> 31:57.640
 of the network puts together, and that's extremely expensive.

31:57.640 --> 32:02.960
 In proof of stake, instead of relying on people with computers that are just constantly cranking

32:02.960 --> 32:10.640
 out hashes 24 seven, as your unit of economic resources, you just use holdings of coins

32:10.640 --> 32:12.120
 inside the system.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.840
 All of these blockchains, they have some kind of coin in them.

32:14.840 --> 32:19.720
 Bitcoin has Bitcoin, Ethereum has Ether, they all have a coin, so why not just use that

32:19.720 --> 32:27.640
 as the economic resource that you're using to measure participation?

32:27.640 --> 32:32.000
 That's the core distinction between proof of work and proof of stake.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.880
 I like proof of stake, and I've liked proof of stake for many years basically because

32:36.880 --> 32:41.640
 it just requires much less ongoing resource consumption.

32:41.640 --> 32:46.440
 With proof of work, you have to actually go and buy these physical computers.

32:46.440 --> 32:52.160
 These days, they have specialized hardware, ASICs, application specific integrated circuits.

32:52.160 --> 32:56.040
 You have to go produce them, you have to go buy them, and unless you have millions of

32:56.040 --> 33:00.120
 dollars, you have to buy them from one of these other people who creates them, and those

33:00.120 --> 33:06.240
 other people often end up taking a huge cut of the profits themselves, and then you have

33:06.240 --> 33:11.720
 to plug them in, you have to just burn all of this electricity that's just running 24

33:11.720 --> 33:12.720
 seven.

33:12.720 --> 33:19.560
 It consumes a huge amount of energy, and not just energy, it also just to create the hardware.

33:19.560 --> 33:23.920
 People focus a lot on energy, but actually about half the cost of proof of work mining

33:23.920 --> 33:26.800
 is the cost of the hardware.

33:26.800 --> 33:32.440
 Proof of stake is a very big deal too, and you need this really big and powerful, very

33:32.440 --> 33:36.200
 specialized hardware, another kind that fills up these big warehouses.

33:36.200 --> 33:40.360
 Proof of stake, you don't really need that much electricity, you just need just a little

33:40.360 --> 33:43.240
 bit to run a regular computer.

33:43.240 --> 33:48.840
 You can run proof of stake validators on computers that you already have.

33:48.840 --> 33:54.480
 It's just much less resource intensive, and this is good for a few reasons.

33:54.480 --> 33:59.720
 One is the kind of environmental rationale that you're not breaking the environment.

33:59.720 --> 34:05.480
 The second is that you're not taking away electricity and other resources from other

34:05.480 --> 34:08.000
 people.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.320
 I think just today I saw a story about Iran wanting to shut down some Bitcoin mining because

34:13.320 --> 34:17.520
 it was just grabbing up so much electricity that it was outbidding the nearby towns and

34:17.520 --> 34:20.080
 they didn't have enough.

34:20.080 --> 34:26.080
 Then there was Chia, the one that's doing proof of hard disk mining, is just grabbing

34:26.080 --> 34:29.360
 up so many hard disks that there's a shortage.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.000
 That's the second reason.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.200
 The third more selfish reason is that because participating in consensus does not require

34:36.200 --> 34:41.560
 so much energy expenditure, you don't need to pay people as much to participate.

34:41.560 --> 34:47.600
 Bitcoin and Ethereum, they both issue somewhere around 4% of the total supply area right now

34:47.600 --> 34:48.600
 to miners.

34:48.600 --> 34:53.840
 Ethereum is about 4.7 million ether, and the current supply is about 115 million.

34:53.840 --> 35:01.680
 With proof of stake, we expect it'll be somewhere between 500,000 and 1 million per year.

35:01.680 --> 35:07.720
 That means the supply doesn't have to increase so quickly.

35:07.720 --> 35:15.080
 One of the pros that people argue for the proof of work is that it is secure because

35:15.080 --> 35:23.080
 it's much more difficult to, as you've highlighted, it's difficult to participate.

35:23.080 --> 35:29.000
 What are your thoughts about the security of the proof of stake mechanism?

35:29.000 --> 35:30.840
 Is there ways to make it secure?

35:30.840 --> 35:36.560
 I think proof of stake is very secure because in order to be able to attack the system,

35:36.560 --> 35:42.200
 you need to have basically as much stake as the rest of the network.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.840
 Right now, for example, we have 5 million ETH staking, so you have to come up with 5

35:45.840 --> 35:49.200
 million ETH and then join the network.

35:49.200 --> 35:52.120
 The other 5 million ETH is a lot.

35:52.120 --> 35:55.520
 It's like, how much is it now, like $15 billion.

35:55.520 --> 36:00.800
 That's actually more than, I believe, the cost of attacking the Bitcoin network.

36:00.800 --> 36:05.320
 The second thing is that recovering from attacks is much easier in proof of stake than in proof

36:05.320 --> 36:10.880
 of work because in proof of stake, first of all, for many kinds of attacks that you do

36:10.880 --> 36:15.480
 against this network, we have this concept of automatic slashing, which basically means

36:15.480 --> 36:21.320
 that in order to revert a finalized block, so if there's one block that's accepted by

36:21.320 --> 36:26.320
 the network and you try to convince the network to revert that block and accept a different

36:26.320 --> 36:33.480
 block, in order to make that attack, you basically have to have a big portion of your validators

36:33.480 --> 36:36.120
 signed to conflicting messages.

36:36.120 --> 36:40.200
 This is something that once these messages are on the network, you can go and prove.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.880
 Look, these people did it.

36:41.880 --> 36:45.400
 We have this feature in the protocol called slashing, where you basically take all these

36:45.400 --> 36:48.920
 people who provably misbehaved and you burn their coins.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.120
 You don't burn anyone else's coins.

36:51.120 --> 36:56.040
 There are other cases like, for example, if instead of reverting blocks, the attack just

36:56.040 --> 37:01.800
 tries to censor everyone, then everyone who got censored would just basically create the

37:01.800 --> 37:06.520
 minority chain and then the community would basically have to do a soft fork.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.160
 They would just have to say, look, this chain is clearly attacking us.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.760
 This chain is the one not attacking us, and so we're going to join this chain.

37:12.760 --> 37:18.360
 Then what happens is that on that new chain, the attackers also lose a lot of coins.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.960
 The difference between proof of stake and proof of work is that in a proof of stake

37:21.960 --> 37:28.600
 system, you can identify specific participants and you can say, this isn't a human going

37:28.600 --> 37:29.600
 in and saying, I don't like you.

37:29.600 --> 37:30.600
 I don't like you.

37:30.600 --> 37:31.600
 I don't like you.

37:31.600 --> 37:32.600
 I don't like you.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.600
 This is automated.

37:33.600 --> 37:34.600
 The slashing process is automated.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.600
 Yes.

37:35.600 --> 37:41.360
 There are ways it can go wrong, so that's a painful process where the coins are burned.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.440
 It is painful, yes.

37:44.440 --> 37:50.000
 The one big unknown, of course, is if an attack actually happens and if an attack happens

37:50.000 --> 37:56.040
 that requires the community to actually choose one of these minority forks, then what would

37:56.040 --> 38:02.120
 the community actually successfully coordinating on this look like?

38:02.120 --> 38:07.840
 We can talk about it and we can write science fiction novels about it, but until it's happened,

38:07.840 --> 38:11.040
 you don't really know the details of what it looks like and how difficult it is.

38:11.040 --> 38:15.040
 What are the channels of communication for the community if you can enlighten me a little

38:15.040 --> 38:18.040
 bit?

38:18.040 --> 38:23.040
 In many ways, in the political realm, Twitter is often used as a way to have these emergent

38:23.040 --> 38:28.400
 phenomena of large groups of people coming to a consensus about a particular idea, and

38:28.400 --> 38:30.520
 then there's battle for consensus.

38:30.520 --> 38:39.280
 What's in the Ethereum community, what are the sources of natural language based communication

38:39.280 --> 38:44.080
 that have an emergent belief structure that you would say?

38:44.080 --> 38:45.560
 Or is it all through money?

38:45.560 --> 38:48.240
 Is it all through trading that the communication happens?

38:48.240 --> 38:51.160
 There's definitely talking as well.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.920
 We have to agree on protocol changes somehow.

38:53.920 --> 38:59.880
 There's Twitter, there's Reddit, there's GitHub, there's all of the various Ethereum

38:59.880 --> 39:02.960
 forums, Ethereum magicians, Ethereum research.

39:02.960 --> 39:05.200
 There's just in person communication.

39:05.200 --> 39:12.040
 Then there's just the hidden web of everyone talking to everyone on Telegram or Signal.

39:12.040 --> 39:18.480
 It's some of everything, but I think the thing to emphasize around, can you actually come

39:18.480 --> 39:23.680
 to consensus on whether or not to fork the chain because the attacker is answering everyone,

39:23.680 --> 39:30.800
 for example, is everyone who's running a node is going to see almost the same thing.

39:30.800 --> 39:35.320
 They're going to be off by a few seconds, and maybe they'll disagree by a few minutes,

39:35.320 --> 39:38.840
 but if it's a serious attack, people are going to know.

39:38.840 --> 39:45.240
 It's not one of those things where, oh, we're trying to agree on, did Epstein kill himself

39:45.240 --> 39:50.880
 or some random political fact where in reality no one knows a single thing about what's actually

39:50.880 --> 39:53.120
 going on and they're all speculating.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.880
 It is much more visible.

39:54.880 --> 40:00.880
 We do have that, but at the same time, I'm happy to admit that these are fairly untested

40:00.880 --> 40:06.200
 mechanisms, but at the same time, they're also untested mechanisms in proof of work.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.800
 In proof of work, it's even harder because in proof of work, you don't have the ability

40:09.800 --> 40:16.520
 to identify and say, I'm going to, these miners attacked, and so we're not going to let these

40:16.520 --> 40:20.400
 miners in, these miners did not attack, so we're going to keep them in.

40:20.400 --> 40:25.320
 You have to pretty much either take out none of the miners or you do a fork that changes

40:25.320 --> 40:29.720
 the proof of work algorithm, which takes out all of the miners.

40:29.720 --> 40:34.520
 The economics of recovering from attacks in proof of work, at least to me, actually do

40:34.520 --> 40:40.480
 seem more unfavorable, but I'm sure the proof of work people you talk to will give very

40:40.480 --> 40:44.800
 different and contradictory opinions, and that's totally fine and amazing.

40:44.800 --> 40:51.840
 Some people describe MEV, minor extractable value, as an existential risk to Ethereum.

40:51.840 --> 40:52.920
 What is MEV?

40:52.920 --> 40:55.080
 How important is it to solve an MEV?

40:55.080 --> 40:57.000
 If it's important, what ideas do you have?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
 Sure.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
 How about after this one?

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
 We'll also talk about sharding because it's amazing and it's part of the review too.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.600
 We'll return back to sharding, which is, we'll return to the big picture of the scaling

41:06.600 --> 41:07.600
 problem, as you mentioned.

41:07.600 --> 41:12.840
 I love this conversation, you know, depth first search instead of breadth first.

41:12.840 --> 41:19.720
 Basically, okay, MEV, minor extractable value, it is not different in proof of work and proof

41:19.720 --> 41:20.720
 of stake, right?

41:20.720 --> 41:25.680
 If you want to call it block proposal or extractable value, it sounds less sexy, but we can call

41:25.680 --> 41:28.240
 it BPEV instead of MAV, who cares?

41:28.240 --> 41:32.880
 This is a problem in both proof of work and proof of stake.

41:32.880 --> 41:40.840
 The basic idea is that if you have the ability to choose which transactions go into a block

41:40.840 --> 41:46.320
 and in what order, then you have the ability to take advantage of that position for economic

41:46.320 --> 41:50.320
 gain in a lot more ways than just collecting transaction fees, right?

41:50.320 --> 41:54.480
 For example, there's decentralized exchanges on chain like Uniswap.

41:54.480 --> 42:02.280
 Let's say the price of ETH versus USDC was $2,700 the previous block, but then there

42:02.280 --> 42:06.640
 was a bit of a market drop and now it's $2,680, where you can go on Uniswap and you can just

42:06.640 --> 42:14.560
 gobble up the entire part of the automated order book that's between $2,700 and $2,680.

42:14.560 --> 42:20.000
 Then at the same time, you run a bot and you buy some ETH back at $2,680 and you've just

42:20.000 --> 42:22.200
 made about $10 of profit, right?

42:22.200 --> 42:26.000
 Well, $10 times whatever the depth is, right?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.680
 There's lots of little things like that.

42:28.680 --> 42:33.720
 There's also things that involve front running other people's transactions.

42:33.720 --> 42:40.960
 One example of this would be that if someone sends a transaction that says, buy me five

42:40.960 --> 42:51.160
 ETH for whatever price that you can get, but with a maximum of, let's say $15,000, then

42:51.160 --> 42:56.600
 you can go and you can put a transaction right in front of that transaction and you can buy

42:56.600 --> 43:01.040
 up that ETH first and then you resell it to him at $15,000 minus one.

43:01.040 --> 43:04.040
 Then you get to make a little bit of money that way.

43:04.040 --> 43:05.040
 Exactly.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.720
 There's a lot of these different arbitrage front running, back running, these different

43:07.720 --> 43:13.560
 tricks that allow block proposers to get some percentage on top like overhead.

43:13.560 --> 43:14.560
 Exactly.

43:14.560 --> 43:24.240
 The reason why this is a challenge is because first of all, it sometimes degrades user experience

43:24.240 --> 43:30.480
 because users get less favorable trades, but there are sometimes ways to mitigate that

43:30.480 --> 43:31.480
 for applications.

43:31.480 --> 43:35.920
 Sometimes it's not that bad, but the bigger risk that I think some people consider more

43:35.920 --> 43:41.280
 existential is that there's just much more economies of scale in figuring out how to

43:41.280 --> 43:45.680
 extract all this revenue because if you're just collecting transaction fees, there aren't

43:45.680 --> 43:47.480
 really economies of scale.

43:47.480 --> 43:50.560
 There aren't really benefits to centralizing because it's a very simple formula.

43:50.560 --> 43:55.920
 You just grab up the transactions that pay you the most, but with MEV, there's all these

43:55.920 --> 44:01.040
 sophisticated algorithms, and if you have lots of money, then you can hire really smart

44:01.040 --> 44:04.640
 people to make amazing algorithms, and then you can use the other half of your money to

44:04.640 --> 44:08.360
 get a lot of mining power, a lot of stake, and you get a lot of opportunities to use

44:08.360 --> 44:11.600
 your even better algorithms.

44:11.600 --> 44:18.160
 There's this risk that as a result of this, mining is basically, or even validating, improve

44:18.160 --> 44:21.000
 of stake is going to centralize.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.760
 I think the ecosystem is best replied to this sort of risk, and it's the direction

44:25.760 --> 44:33.720
 where projects like flashbots are going already is if you can't eliminate the centralization,

44:33.720 --> 44:35.440
 then you try to firewall it.

44:35.440 --> 44:41.160
 The way that you firewall it is, you basically say, we're going to try to deliberately create

44:41.160 --> 44:46.520
 a marketplace where people can just do the complicated work of creating what are called

44:46.520 --> 44:52.000
 bundles, like the bundles of transactions that are very profitable.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.640
 And then at the other side of the market, you just have block proposes or miners that

44:56.640 --> 45:02.040
 are just dumb notes, and they go and ask what are called searchers, the bundle creators,

45:02.040 --> 45:05.800
 and they just ask, hey, how much can you give me if I put in your bundle, and then they

45:05.800 --> 45:07.800
 just take the highest offer.

45:07.800 --> 45:11.800
 So you sort of separate out the task, and you have the easy part, and then you have

45:11.800 --> 45:15.600
 the hard part, and you have this special class of actor called a searcher that does the hard

45:15.600 --> 45:20.720
 part, and then the easy part, the people doing the easy part, which is just miners and validators,

45:20.720 --> 45:26.480
 they just talk to all the different people doing the searching, and they just accept

45:26.480 --> 45:27.920
 the highest bidder.

45:27.920 --> 45:36.360
 So this is just an interesting example of economic design philosophy.

45:36.360 --> 45:40.760
 Sometimes you can't just make centralization go away, sometimes it's inevitable, but at

45:40.760 --> 45:48.600
 least you can try to contain it, you can direct it, or you can even firewall it away from core

45:48.600 --> 45:51.720
 consensus, the parts that really do need to be decentralized.

45:51.720 --> 45:56.720
 But you don't see it as an existential risk, it's just a bit of a problem that has to be

45:56.720 --> 45:58.880
 constantly dealt with.

45:58.880 --> 45:59.880
 It's a risk.

45:59.880 --> 46:05.640
 There's obviously a risk that it's a very severe problem, and that even this FlashBots

46:05.640 --> 46:12.240
 approach has some fatal flaw or whatever, but we're definitely approaching it with the

46:12.240 --> 46:16.600
 mindset of this is a problem, and yes, we do have to do some work to solve it, but we're

46:16.600 --> 46:19.600
 doing it, and so far it's being solved.

46:19.600 --> 46:26.600
 Okay, let's talk about the other really, really fascinating part of the future of Ethereum.

46:26.600 --> 46:32.520
 Let's not call it Ethereum 2.0, but the future of Ethereum that also may require a hard fork.

46:32.520 --> 46:35.000
 I don't know, you can correct me on this.

46:35.000 --> 46:48.320
 Is, well, broadly, ideas for scaling and more specifically Layer 1 and 2 intersection ideas

46:48.320 --> 46:53.400
 of how to achieve scaling, and at the core of that is the idea of sharding.

46:53.400 --> 46:57.920
 First, what is sharding?

46:57.920 --> 47:03.480
 There's two major paradigms for scaling blockchains, as you said, Layer 1 and Layer 2.

47:03.480 --> 47:09.720
 Layer 1 basically means make the blockchain itself capable of processing more transactions

47:09.720 --> 47:15.520
 by having some mechanism by which it can do that, despite the fact that there's a limit

47:15.520 --> 47:19.240
 to the capacity of each participant in the blockchain, and Layer 2 says, well, we're

47:19.240 --> 47:24.160
 going to keep the blockchain as is, but we're going to create clever protocols that sit

47:24.160 --> 47:28.600
 on top of the blockchain, that still use the blockchain, and that still inherit things

47:28.600 --> 47:32.960
 like the security guarantees of a blockchain, but at the same time, a lot of things are

47:32.960 --> 47:37.720
 done off chain, and so you get more scalability that way.

47:37.720 --> 47:42.080
 In Ethereum, the most popular paradigm for Layer 2 is rollups, and the most popular paradigm

47:42.080 --> 47:43.640
 for Layer 1 is sharding.

47:43.640 --> 47:50.560
 One way to achieve Layer 1 scaling is to increase the block size, hence the block size, wars,

47:50.560 --> 47:57.480
 quote, unquote, and you actually tweeted something about, people are saying that Vitalik changed

47:57.480 --> 48:01.720
 his mind about the, he went from being a small...

48:01.720 --> 48:03.480
 No, I went from being big to small.

48:03.480 --> 48:10.600
 Big to small, but you said I've been a medium blocker all along, so maybe you can also comment

48:10.600 --> 48:16.400
 on the very basic aspect before we even get the sharding of where you stand on this block

48:16.400 --> 48:17.560
 size debate.

48:17.560 --> 48:18.560
 Sure.

48:18.560 --> 48:22.240
 The way that I think about the trade off is I think about it as a trade off between

48:22.240 --> 48:26.480
 making it easy to write to the blockchain and making it easy to read the blockchain,

48:26.480 --> 48:30.760
 so when I say read, I just mean have a node and actually verify it and make sure that

48:30.760 --> 48:35.720
 it's correct and all of those things, and then by write, I mean send transactions.

48:35.720 --> 48:40.400
 I think for decentralization, it's important for both of these tasks to be accessible,

48:40.400 --> 48:43.160
 and I think that they're about equally important.

48:43.160 --> 48:46.440
 If you have a chain that's too expensive to read, then everyone will just trust a few

48:46.440 --> 48:50.840
 people to read for them, and then those people can change the rules without anyone else's

48:50.840 --> 48:51.960
 permission.

48:51.960 --> 48:56.440
 But if on the other hand, it becomes really expensive to write, then everyone will move

48:56.440 --> 49:02.680
 on to basically second layer systems that are incredibly centralized, and that takes

49:02.680 --> 49:07.160
 away from decentralization and self sovereignty as well.

49:07.160 --> 49:10.200
 This has been my viewpoints pretty much the whole time.

49:10.200 --> 49:14.440
 You need this balance and going in one direction or the other direction is very unhealthy.

49:14.440 --> 49:20.760
 In the Bitcoin case, basically what happened was that Bitcoin originally, at the very beginning,

49:20.760 --> 49:22.160
 it didn't really have a block size.

49:22.160 --> 49:28.600
 It just had an accidental block size limit of 32 megabytes because that just happens

49:28.600 --> 49:31.480
 to be the limit of the peer to peer messages.

49:31.480 --> 49:32.480
 Interesting.

49:32.480 --> 49:33.960
 I didn't even know that part.

49:33.960 --> 49:39.000
 But then Satoshi back in 2010 was worried that even 32 megabyte blocks would be too

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
 hard to process.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.960
 He put the limit down to one megabyte, and I think the...

49:44.960 --> 49:47.600
 If I put, you mean, sneaked in there.

49:47.600 --> 49:51.760
 Yeah, just made an update to the Bitcoin software that made blocks bigger than what I think

49:51.760 --> 49:55.280
 it's a million bytes invalid.

49:55.280 --> 50:00.280
 I think the impression that most people had at the time is that this is just a temporary

50:00.280 --> 50:06.320
 safety measure, and over time, as we become more confident in the software, that limit

50:06.320 --> 50:16.760
 would be raised somewhat, but then when the actual usage of the blockchain started going

50:16.760 --> 50:22.160
 up and then it started going up first to 100 kilobytes per block, then to 250 kilobytes

50:22.160 --> 50:27.160
 per block, then to 500 kilobytes per block, there started a kind of coming out of the

50:27.160 --> 50:33.040
 woodworks, this opinion that like, no, that limit should just not be increased.

50:33.040 --> 50:40.360
 Then there were all of these attempts at compromising, first there was a proposal for 20 megabyte

50:40.360 --> 50:46.440
 blocks, then there was the 248 proposal, which is a bit ironic because the 248 proposal started

50:46.440 --> 50:51.560
 off being a small block negotiating position, but then when the big block people came back

50:51.560 --> 50:55.640
 and said, hey, aren't we gonna do this, they're like, no, no, no, we don't want the block

50:55.640 --> 50:59.240
 size increases anymore.

50:59.240 --> 51:04.440
 There were these two different positions, the small blockers, I think they valued one

51:04.440 --> 51:06.320
 megabyte blocks for two reasons.

51:06.320 --> 51:10.200
 One is that they just really, really believe in the importance of being able to read the

51:10.200 --> 51:16.760
 chain, but two is that a lot of them really believe in maintaining this norm of never

51:16.760 --> 51:19.320
 hard forking.

51:19.320 --> 51:26.480
 The difference between a hard fork and a soft fork is basically that in a soft fork, any

51:26.480 --> 51:30.320
 block that's valid under the new rules was still valid under the old rules.

51:30.320 --> 51:33.720
 If you have a client that verifies according to the old rules, then you'll still be able

51:33.720 --> 51:40.160
 to accept the chain that follows the new rules, whereas with a hard fork, you have to update

51:40.160 --> 51:45.520
 your code in order to stay on the chain.

51:45.520 --> 51:51.080
 They have this belief that soft forks are either less coercive than hard forks, which

51:51.080 --> 51:52.720
 by the way, I completely disagree with.

51:52.720 --> 51:57.120
 I actually think soft forks are more coercive because basically they force everyone who

51:57.120 --> 52:01.440
 disagrees to go along by default.

52:01.440 --> 52:10.120
 Or they have this opinion that it's more difficult to abuse soft forks to do really

52:10.120 --> 52:15.080
 mean things or that completely violate people's expectations like increasing the supply, which

52:15.080 --> 52:19.440
 is again, I think there is some truth to that.

52:19.440 --> 52:23.600
 Because of these reasons, they just say, we're only going to do soft forks and we want to

52:23.600 --> 52:26.280
 just not do any hard forks.

52:26.280 --> 52:29.920
 They eventually discovered this idea called segregated witness that allows for a very

52:29.920 --> 52:36.960
 tiny block size increase to the equivalent of about two megabytes with a soft fork.

52:36.960 --> 52:42.440
 This is a really weird and devious trick.

52:42.440 --> 52:47.440
 Basically what they do is they take the signatures of transactions and then they put them outside

52:47.440 --> 52:48.440
 of the block.

52:48.440 --> 52:53.000
 Then they add an extra rule that says that every block to be valid, the block has to

52:53.000 --> 52:59.440
 come with a separate extension block that contains all of the transaction signatures.

52:59.440 --> 53:02.920
 When you measure it according to the old rules, like, hey, it adds up to less than a million,

53:02.920 --> 53:07.920
 but actually there's this extension block that the old protocol doesn't even know about.

53:07.920 --> 53:13.440
 It's a hack that seemed to work in a small way, then besides the block size.

53:13.440 --> 53:16.480
 Small block size was happy with these very low levels of block size and then the big

53:16.480 --> 53:23.800
 block size wanted to expand to at the very least go to four megabytes, then maybe 820.

53:23.800 --> 53:26.520
 There's disagreements within there as well.

53:26.520 --> 53:34.120
 I definitely was favoring the big side the whole way through, as you can probably tell.

53:34.120 --> 53:41.720
 Even though the argument against the big is that it makes things more centralized.

53:41.720 --> 53:45.600
 Because fewer people can run and know that verifies the chain and also because any of

53:45.600 --> 53:49.280
 these things would require a hard fork and hard forks are inherently risky.

53:49.280 --> 53:51.760
 Do you think there's truth to that?

53:51.760 --> 53:52.760
 I'm pro hard fork.

53:52.760 --> 53:58.120
 I think hard forks are actually in a politically economic sense, they're better than soft

53:58.120 --> 54:00.720
 forks.

54:00.720 --> 54:08.920
 I think that's a beautiful principle as stated that soft forks may be more coercive than

54:08.920 --> 54:11.280
 hard forks.

54:11.280 --> 54:16.000
 This is not just about cryptocurrency, this is about politics and life.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.080
 That's fascinating.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.400
 You're okay with hard forks.

54:20.400 --> 54:25.800
 In fact, you think hard forks is the right way to make changes because then everybody's

54:25.800 --> 54:27.680
 forced to make a decision.

54:27.680 --> 54:32.360
 Do you accept this change or not as opposed to ideas being sneaked in behind the door

54:32.360 --> 54:35.240
 and the decisions forced on you?

54:35.240 --> 54:36.240
 Exactly.

54:36.240 --> 54:37.240
 Yeah.

54:37.240 --> 54:42.880
 But hard forks, some people say, this is when they talk about Ethereum, is there's some

54:42.880 --> 54:48.120
 aspect to a hard fork where you're trying to upgrade what is it, airplane while it's

54:48.120 --> 54:50.720
 flying?

54:50.720 --> 54:53.680
 I think soft forks are also upgrading an airplane while it's flying.

54:53.680 --> 54:56.320
 But it's just smaller upgrades.

54:56.320 --> 55:04.560
 There's some truth to that, there's definitely a bit more risk of a split as a result of

55:04.560 --> 55:07.280
 a hard fork than as a result of a soft fork.

55:07.280 --> 55:10.760
 And the split is highly undesirable, right?

55:10.760 --> 55:11.760
 Well it depends.

55:11.760 --> 55:14.240
 If it's a split because of a bug, then that's horrible.

55:14.240 --> 55:18.720
 If it's a split as a result of political differences, then I think a split is better

55:18.720 --> 55:24.600
 than one side being forced to basically just suck it up and accept the majority position

55:24.600 --> 55:27.320
 even if it really hates it.

55:27.320 --> 55:32.240
 What there's also political connections throughout the history of the United States is sometimes

55:32.240 --> 55:38.760
 groups of people that strongly disagree with each other should be forced to work it out

55:38.760 --> 55:42.760
 even when a split seems like an easy thing in the short term.

55:42.760 --> 55:44.760
 And it depends.

55:44.760 --> 55:50.560
 For blockchains in particular, the costs of people being able to peacefully go off and

55:50.560 --> 55:52.360
 do their own thing are much lower.

55:52.360 --> 56:00.040
 If you have a country and you have two groups, then often enough fighting out the new rules

56:00.040 --> 56:05.120
 requires a civil war requires everyone to move and so forth, but on a blockchain, the

56:05.120 --> 56:07.720
 costs are lower.

56:07.720 --> 56:13.400
 So if you were to look at the way things worked out with the block size wars and there was

56:13.400 --> 56:18.800
 a split, what is it, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin.

56:18.800 --> 56:24.080
 Like you looking, putting on your historian hat, you mentioned offline you like Dan Carlin.

56:24.080 --> 56:31.880
 So if Dan Carlin wanted to do an episode on the block size wars, do you think it could

56:31.880 --> 56:37.640
 have turned out better or are you okay with the way it turned out?

56:37.640 --> 56:44.120
 I'm definitely disappointed with what happened with the big block side.

56:44.120 --> 56:49.160
 I think the source of my disappointment is that one of the things that you notice when

56:49.160 --> 56:54.720
 just looking at this political disagreements generally, especially when you have environments

56:54.720 --> 56:59.440
 where they're authoritarian or a single party dominated and then there's some opposition

56:59.440 --> 57:04.400
 party and the opposition often has very legitimate grievances, but at the same time, the thing

57:04.400 --> 57:07.280
 you notice is that often enough, the opposition just sucks.

57:07.280 --> 57:13.200
 It just doesn't have political capacity, it doesn't have the ability to come up with policy

57:13.200 --> 57:19.440
 because its entire culture is designed around resisting much more and then it's designed

57:19.440 --> 57:23.680
 around actually debating serious policy trade offs.

57:23.680 --> 57:29.800
 And I worry, or I guess not so much worry because it's already happened, I unfortunately

57:29.800 --> 57:34.160
 think that Bitcoin Cash ended up being a victim of this, right?

57:34.160 --> 57:38.560
 Like first there was a split with Bitcoin Cash and then of course, Craig Wright came

57:38.560 --> 57:44.720
 in and you know, Craig Wright was this basically scammer who just keeps on pretending that he

57:44.720 --> 57:47.800
 is Sato Shinakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin.

57:47.800 --> 57:50.120
 Hey, Craig Wright's legal team, do you hear me?

57:50.120 --> 57:52.280
 Yes, I still think your client is a scammer.

57:52.280 --> 57:53.280
 So sue me.

57:53.280 --> 57:57.200
 This is definitely going to be depth first search because I got to ask you, Craig, because

57:57.200 --> 58:01.120
 this people have been contacting me and I'm trying to figure out like what is up with

58:01.120 --> 58:02.560
 this human being.

58:02.560 --> 58:09.040
 So for people who don't know, there's somebody who is, let's start, there's Sato Shinakamoto,

58:09.040 --> 58:14.840
 who is the creator of Bitcoin who's anonymous and actually most really big people in the

58:14.840 --> 58:22.880
 cryptocurrency space do not like yourself and others do not dare claim that they are

58:22.880 --> 58:25.280
 even for fun Sato Shinakamoto.

58:25.280 --> 58:29.760
 In fact, if Sato Shinakamoto is still alive and is like, if say you were Sato Shinakamoto,

58:29.760 --> 58:35.840
 it seems like the thing he would do is probably or she is trying to remain anonymous.

58:35.840 --> 58:41.080
 On the flip side of that, there's a guy named Craig Wright who continually keeps claiming

58:41.080 --> 58:46.000
 that he is in fact Sato Shinakamoto and keeps suing a lot of people.

58:46.000 --> 58:52.720
 So on him, if we could just linger on him, what do you make of this character?

58:52.720 --> 58:54.560
 What are we supposed to make of this character?

58:54.560 --> 58:56.240
 Should he be ignored?

58:56.240 --> 59:00.040
 Is there any possible truth to his claims?

59:00.040 --> 59:01.040
 What do you make of him?

59:01.040 --> 59:06.040
 The analogy that's at the top of my head will get a bit political, but that's fine.

59:06.040 --> 59:07.720
 You've had Michael Ballas.

59:07.720 --> 59:13.400
 So I guess I view Craig Wright as being kind of like a Donald Trump figure in that he's

59:13.400 --> 59:22.040
 not very intellectual, but I think he gets a big audience because he says things that

59:22.040 --> 59:28.000
 like play to the resentments that people have and he says things that people wants to hear.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.720
 Like in the wake of this block size war, the big blockers did feel very disenchanted.

59:32.720 --> 59:36.960
 They felt that Bitcoin always had this vision that we were supposed to just keep increasing

59:36.960 --> 59:39.240
 the block size and Bitcoin is peer to peer cash.

59:39.240 --> 59:40.920
 It says so in the white paper.

59:40.920 --> 59:45.680
 And then this elitist clique of core devs just like came in and said, no, no, no, we're

59:45.680 --> 59:47.880
 going to impose this totally different vision.

59:47.880 --> 59:52.040
 And if you ever want your scalability, you'll have to wait for us to create this totally

59:52.040 --> 59:55.840
 unproven fancy technology called the lightning network that works on your completely different

59:55.840 --> 59:56.840
 principles.

59:56.840 --> 1:00:02.200
 And, you know, they were very angry at this and I think a lot of that anger is justified.

1:00:02.200 --> 1:00:08.360
 But at the same time, you know, when people are in that mental state, like it's very easy

1:00:08.360 --> 1:00:10.440
 for you to just kind of like latch on.

1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:16.480
 And if you find someone who expresses anger at the same things that you're angry at and

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:21.800
 also like it seems like someone who's strong and seems like someone who, you know, might

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:22.960
 be good to rally around.

1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:24.800
 It's very easy to just like get behind that.

1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:28.560
 But that extra part about where he's touching the ground, I don't understand why that's

1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:29.560
 necessary.

1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:36.120
 I think that he could have done it without that, but that, I mean, that just it's a marketing

1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:38.520
 strategy like it sort of gives him more salience.

1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:40.840
 Like there's other big block personalities, right?

1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:43.120
 Well, what's the difference between with Greg, right?

1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:45.960
 He's not just a big block personality.

1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:48.840
 He's potentially Satoshi.

1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:52.040
 And he did say all the big block things, right?

1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:57.120
 Like he talked about how, oh, the concept of a fee market is fundamentally like economically

1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:01.240
 wrong and it should be, it should be a free market and you should be able to have blocks

1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:02.240
 as big as you want.

1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:03.680
 Like he repeated all the talking points.

1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:08.040
 And so a lot of people were kind of sucked into that, right?

1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:14.000
 And so he unfortunately was able to basically dominate a big part of the Bitcoin cash community

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:15.440
 for a long time.

1:01:15.440 --> 1:01:21.080
 And then eventually, of course, more and more people started to catch on.

1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:24.240
 He would just say technical things that are completely wrong, right?

1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:33.200
 Like one example of this that I remember is that he mixed up the concept of 256 bits and

1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:36.520
 two to the power of 256 bits, right?

1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:41.920
 So the difference is, it's like the difference between 80 and the concept of 80 digit numbers,

1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:42.920
 right?

1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:50.560
 And because of this, like he made this argument that said that Bitcoin's elliptic curve is

1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:54.560
 friendly to cryptographic pairings, like you don't have to understand what that is.

1:01:54.560 --> 1:02:00.120
 But if you want to know, I have articles on both at Vitalik.ca, but basically he made

1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:03.360
 this like technical argument that really hedged on this point.

1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:06.320
 And then when people pressed him on it, it's like, yes, what?

1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:07.320
 No, no, like what?

1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:08.320
 Look, exactly.

1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:11.400
 The height is like two to the 256 bits.

1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:14.120
 That's a very tiny amount of information.

1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:19.640
 No, no, no, two to the 256 bits is more than the amount of information in the universe.

1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:26.120
 And like he equivocated and kind of like preyed on people's inability to understand that mathematical

1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:27.120
 new lens.

1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:28.120
 And I called him out.

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:31.880
 And eventually, I even called him out in person at this conference in Seoul.

1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:37.800
 Like I just stood up and asked, hey, conference organizer, why are you letting this fraud

1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:39.680
 speak at this conference?

1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:44.640
 And I remember even some big blockers at the time getting angry at me.

1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:49.400
 But, you know, eventually they did get rid of him and then Craig, well, basically Craig

1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:55.320
 Wright was forced to split off because the rest of the community refused to accept some

1:02:55.320 --> 1:02:56.960
 network change that he wanted.

1:02:56.960 --> 1:02:59.200
 And so then there was the BCH and BSV.

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:03.920
 And then in the Bitcoin Cash community, there was this drama of, are they going to add a

1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:08.880
 developer fund where they redirect 12.5% of the revenue from the miners to the devs?

1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:15.160
 And according to the libertarian, not aggression principle is this technically theft.

1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:20.840
 Like his understanding of the technical depths of cryptocurrency was lacking in a way that

1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:23.440
 you, Satoshi Nakamoto, certainly would not.

1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:24.440
 Yes, exactly.

1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:29.040
 But the point is that even after Craig Wright got expunged, the Bitcoin Cash community kept

1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:30.480
 having these disagreements, right?

1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:35.600
 And now after this development funds dispute, there was a further split between Bitcoin

1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:37.120
 Cash and ABC.

1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:41.600
 But so, you know, the, the, the branching tree continues to extend, right?

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:42.600
 So.

1:03:42.600 --> 1:03:45.320
 So in that way, it's disappointing to see those kinds of splitting.

1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:46.320
 There was never a result.

1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:47.320
 It is.

1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:54.000
 I would have definitely like wanted to see more of a kind of like the principled coin

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:59.960
 with a, like tries to be Bitcoin, but, but, you know, follows consistent big block values.

1:03:59.960 --> 1:04:04.560
 But I know, maybe I should just like stop expecting projects that I have no involvement

1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:08.480
 in to be care at all about what my values are and, you know, like maybe Ethereum just

1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:09.480
 like is.

1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:16.560
 I think you have a powerful voice and you can inspire other projects to do, to, to, to

1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:19.120
 live up to their best possible selves.

1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:20.280
 Okay.

1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:25.720
 So that's the level, that's the layer one approach.

1:04:25.720 --> 1:04:29.440
 The other layer one within Ethereum is the idea of sharding.

1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:30.440
 Yes.

1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:31.440
 What the heck is sharding?

1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:32.440
 Okay.

1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:33.840
 What is the future of sharding look like?

1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:37.080
 So to summarize that big, long tangent that we just, uh,

1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:39.040
 It's a beautiful tangent, by the way.

1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:40.040
 It's the basic tangent.

1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:45.280
 And I think like crypto is just one of the most underrated aspects of crypto is I think

1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:49.840
 how you can like analyze the, you know, the sociology and the politics and the anthropology

1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:54.240
 and like, yeah, and I'm sure Dan Carle would have fun exploring the space at some point.

1:04:54.240 --> 1:04:58.320
 But like the core tradeoff, right, is that if you scale blockchains the dumb way just

1:04:58.320 --> 1:05:02.400
 by increasing the parameters, then eventually you just make it harder and harder to participate

1:05:02.400 --> 1:05:07.200
 as a node and you end up with a system where there's like 20 computers running the whole

1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:09.680
 thing and it's just very centralized.

1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:13.840
 So sharding basically says, well, instead of just increasing the parameters, what we're

1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:21.280
 going to do is we're going to change the blockchain architecture in such a way that each individual

1:05:21.280 --> 1:05:26.080
 node in the blockchain only needs to store a small portion of the data and only needs

1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:28.920
 to process a small portion of the transactions.

1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:32.600
 So you can think about it as being like inspired by BitSorrent, right, like on BitSorrent,

1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:35.720
 there's no such thing as a BitSorrent full node that has every movie, right?

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:40.400
 And, you know, the work is like split up among a huge number of computers and like that makes

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:41.400
 sense.

1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:45.360
 That's, you know, the only sane way to scale a system like that.

1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:49.440
 And if they actually tried making a version of BitSorrent that required full nodes to

1:05:49.440 --> 1:05:53.160
 that store every movie, then, you know, it would have like zero censorship resistance

1:05:53.160 --> 1:05:56.400
 and it would just like, you know, be dead in an instant.

1:05:56.400 --> 1:06:01.680
 So the challenge with taking that model and applying it to blockchains, right, is that

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:04.920
 blockchains aren't just about like spreading data around.

1:06:04.920 --> 1:06:10.360
 They're about agreeing on exactly what data was spread around and ensuring that everything

1:06:10.360 --> 1:06:12.560
 that you agree on actually is correct.

1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:16.520
 And so you have this paradox where let's say you want to have a system that supports

1:06:16.520 --> 1:06:22.080
 10,000 transactions a second, but each computer in the network can only personally verify

1:06:22.080 --> 1:06:25.120
 100 transactions a second.

1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:31.800
 So how can each computer get a guarantee about the other 9,900 without actually going and

1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:33.960
 verifying them themselves?

1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:39.880
 And it turns out that there are some like a bundle of different tricks that can do that,

1:06:39.880 --> 1:06:40.880
 right?

1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:43.840
 So like one of them is just random sampling.

1:06:43.840 --> 1:06:48.480
 So the idea behind random sampling is like, let's say for simplicity, this is a proof

1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:55.080
 of stake chain and you have 10,000 validators, validators like, you know, the stakers.

1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:57.880
 And like for simplicity, we'll assume they all have the same number of coins, right?

1:06:57.880 --> 1:07:01.920
 If someone has more coins, we'll just kind of split them up and pretend they're 10 stakers.

1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:08.200
 Then you use like some random shuffling and you basically say, these random hundred validators

1:07:08.200 --> 1:07:10.800
 are assigned to validate this block.

1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:13.200
 These random hundred validators are assigned to validate this block.

1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:16.160
 These random hundred validators are assigned to validate this block.

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:21.480
 And so each individual computer only gets assigned to validate like a small piece.

1:07:21.480 --> 1:07:25.600
 But then the way that the information about like what's valid gets passed around, right,

1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:32.440
 is that when these hundred participants validate a block, they all sign a message basically

1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:35.320
 saying like, yes, we agree that this block is valid.

1:07:35.320 --> 1:07:39.600
 And then like they combine that signature into one, and then they broadcast that signature.

1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:44.320
 And then everyone else, instead of verifying the blocks directly just verifies that signature.

1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:49.160
 And so if I see the signature, I'm not directly convinced that that block is valid.

1:07:49.160 --> 1:07:54.600
 But what I am convinced of is that out of this committee of this randomly selected group

1:07:54.600 --> 1:07:59.600
 of a hundred validators, let's say at least 70 of them agree that this block is valid.

1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:05.000
 And so if I trust that the majority of these participants are all honest, then because it's

1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:09.920
 all randomly selected, the attacker can't just like force themselves into one committee.

1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:13.880
 And so the attacker is going to be evenly spread out too.

1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:18.520
 And so if the entire set of validators is mostly honest, every committee is going to

1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:19.520
 be mostly honest.

1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:22.600
 And so like bad blocks are not going to go through, right?

1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:24.920
 So that's like one simple form of sharding.

1:08:24.920 --> 1:08:27.040
 There's also other more clever things that you can do.

1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:29.920
 So for example, there's this concept of a ZK snark, right?

1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:31.720
 I'll call it as your knowledge proofs.

1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:39.520
 So this is the idea that you can make a cryptographic proof that says, I verified or I ran some

1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:43.440
 complex computation on this piece of data and I got this answer.

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:47.960
 And so if you make these kinds of proofs, then like if you see a ZK snark that says

1:08:47.960 --> 1:08:52.200
 some block is valid, then you're convinced that that block is valid.

1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:58.200
 And even if everyone in that committee is evil, they have no way of making a valid proof

1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:00.080
 for a bad block, right?

1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:04.360
 Because the proof itself, it is a proof that you did the computation where that proof is

1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:09.240
 much easier to verify than just running the computation yourself.

1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:17.080
 And there's once again, super awesome mathematical cryptographic magic behind making ZK snark's

1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:18.080
 work.

1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:23.360
 So it gives you a little bit of a leg up over the 51% honest assumption.

1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:26.520
 So it's a little hack that improves upon the random sampling thing.

1:09:26.520 --> 1:09:27.520
 Exactly.

1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:28.520
 And like there's other hacks, right?

1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:32.400
 Like there is another hack called data availability sampling that allows you to make sure that

1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:35.240
 the data in the blocks was actually published.

1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:39.720
 But like basically, like if you stack a couple of these tricks on top of each other, you

1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:45.040
 can create a system where like I as an individual participant can be convinced that everything

1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:49.280
 that's going on in this distributed blockchain thing is correct without actually personally

1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:51.120
 checking more than like a percent of it.

1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:52.320
 So that's sharding.

1:09:52.320 --> 1:09:53.320
 That's sharding.

1:09:53.320 --> 1:10:02.520
 But as I understand, maybe correct me on this, is in the space of Ethereum, the sharding

1:10:02.520 --> 1:10:07.880
 happens on some fixed number, like the split is on some fixed number.

1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:11.560
 I think it's 64 is the currently sort of proposed number.

1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:15.800
 So how does that help scaling?

1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:19.160
 Is it just a fixed constant scaling by 64?

1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:23.560
 And is that a way to achieve those crazy, the crazy amount of scaling that seems to

1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:28.360
 be required to use cryptocurrency for purchasing?

1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:31.920
 So doing like competing with credit cards and visa and so on.

1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:35.880
 So first, I think like the 64 can be hard forked up over time.

1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:41.320
 So we have set it so that like there's theoretically space in the data structure for a thousand

1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:42.320
 and twenty four shards.

1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:45.440
 It's just that 64 of them are turned on.

1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:49.160
 There are challenges with having more shards because you have to have logic that just like

1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:51.600
 checks and manages all of those shards.

1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:54.880
 And if there's too many of them, then that becomes too expensive.

1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:57.720
 But you know, even still, you can improve quite a bit.

1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:02.880
 And then the other thing that we're doing is if what we're getting maximum scalability

1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:05.840
 by combining rollups and sharding.

1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:08.000
 So this might be a good time to talk about rollups.

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000
 What are rollups?

1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.000
 Okay.

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:11.760
 We're going into layer two ideas.

1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:12.760
 Yes.

1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:23.800
 So the idea behind a rollup is basically that so instead of just publishing transactions

1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:30.000
 directly on chain and having everyone, you know, do all of the checking of those transactions,

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:36.720
 what you do is you create a system where users send their transactions to some part like

1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:40.920
 a central party called an aggregator and like, well, theoretically you can have a system

1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:44.120
 where like the aggregator switches around or anyone can be an aggregator.

1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:47.760
 So you know, it's still like permissionless to send things.

1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:53.840
 Then what the aggregator does is they strip out all of the transaction data that like

1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:57.880
 is not relevant to helping people update the state.

1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:00.960
 So when I say the state, this is like, this is a very important kind of technical term

1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:01.960
 from blockchains.

1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:09.400
 I mean, like account balances, code, like things that are like memory, internal memory

1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:13.000
 of smart contracts, like basically everything the blockchain actually has to keep track

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:14.640
 of and remember, right?

1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:22.720
 So you just put in, you take all these transactions, strip out all the data that's not relevant

1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:25.000
 to telling people how to update the state.

1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.080
 And then you take the data that's needed to update the state and then you're like really

1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:29.080
 compress it, right?

1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:35.760
 So like for example, if we say, you know, I Vitalik have an account that's 0xab58 blah,

1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:39.440
 blah, blah, blah, blah and it's 20 bytes, well, instead we can say, well, I have an

1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:44.920
 account that is number 1874224 in the tree, right?

1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:48.840
 And that goes down from 20 bytes to just like an index and a position, which is three bytes,

1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:49.840
 right?

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:53.720
 So you use all sorts of these fancy compression tracks and you basically just, instead of

1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:58.560
 publishing all these transactions, you publish this like tiny compressed blob, right?

1:12:58.560 --> 1:13:02.760
 So the amount of data that goes on chain goes down by maybe about a factor of 10, right?

1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:06.520
 And then the second thing is that you don't do the computation on chain.

1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:11.400
 Instead you do the computation off chain and there's one of two ways to do this, right?

1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:16.280
 One is called a ZK rollup, which is you just provide a ZK snark that basically says, hey,

1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:22.160
 look, I did this computation and I have this proof that here's some hash of the result

1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:23.520
 and it's correct.

1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:27.560
 And then you stick it on chain and everyone verifies this one proof instead of verifying

1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:29.200
 all these transactions.

1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:33.200
 And then the other approach is called an optimistic rollup, which is basically made of the scheme

1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:39.400
 where like, first someone says like, hey, this is what I think the result of applying

1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:40.880
 these transactions is.

1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:43.780
 And then someone else can say, I disagree, the result is different.

1:13:43.780 --> 1:13:49.160
 And only if two people disagree, do you actually do it on, do you actually just like publish

1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:52.520
 all of the data and run the whole, that whole blog on chain.

1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:56.760
 So if there's disagreements, then you just like run everything on chain and whoever was

1:13:56.760 --> 1:13:58.800
 wrong, like loses a lot of money, right?

1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:01.800
 So like disagreements are very rare and they're very expensive.

1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:05.160
 And then a ZK rollup, you don't even rely on this like challenging game at all.

1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:06.960
 You just rely on a proof.

1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:12.560
 So now the core principle is basically that instead of lots of transactions and all the

1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:17.280
 trends that everyone verifies every transaction, it is you take the transactions, you strip

1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:22.520
 it, strip them down and compress them as much as possible, then stick that on the blockchain.

1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:26.720
 You do need to stick something on the blockchain just so that everyone else can like keep it

1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:28.000
 through, like keep up to date with the state.

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:31.480
 So they know, you know, what all the contracts are, what all the balances are in all of this,

1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:33.680
 but it's a very small amount of data.

1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:38.120
 And then you use some one of these other off chain games, you know, could be this optimistic

1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:43.080
 game could be a ZK snark to just prove that somebody out there did the computation and

1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:44.080
 the result is correct.

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:45.080
 Right.

1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:49.640
 So you're pushing like 90% of the work off chain and then, you know, well, 90% of the

1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:52.880
 data and 99% of the computation off chain.

1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:56.320
 And then you still have 10% of the data and 1% of the computation on chain.

1:14:56.320 --> 1:15:00.040
 And so, you know, your scalability goes up by a factor of about 100.

1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:05.520
 So these systems are already live for, for some applications, right?

1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:10.200
 So there's something called loop ring, which is just a ZK roll up for payments, right?

1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:15.760
 So you can have, you know, assets inside of, inside of the loop ring system, and you can

1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:17.640
 go around and transfer them.

1:15:17.640 --> 1:15:24.600
 But what you, and you get like much lower transaction fees, right?

1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:28.600
 Like instead of $5, you'd have to pay like less than five cents.

1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:33.400
 But the only problem is that this only supports a couple of applications right now, like making

1:15:33.400 --> 1:15:38.960
 one that supports anything that you can do on Ethereum just takes a bit more work, but

1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:39.960
 that's being done as well.

1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:40.960
 Right.

1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:46.080
 So like within a few months, I'm expecting, you know, fully Ethereum, capable rollups

1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:48.920
 to be available as well.

1:15:48.920 --> 1:15:53.200
 So then it's a rollups, just summarizing, you know, do most of the work off chain, put

1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:57.400
 only a little bit on chain, factor of a hundred scaling, sharding and other factor of a hundred

1:15:57.400 --> 1:16:01.160
 scaling, a hundred times a hundred factor of 10,000, you know, hundreds of thousands

1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:03.840
 of transactions a second and like, you know, there's your scalability.

1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:04.840
 Okay.

1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:05.840
 So it's your scalability.

1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:10.200
 You can do a large number of transactions very quickly and the cost to do those transactions

1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:11.640
 are much lower.

1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:18.560
 You wrote that in the long term, ZK rollups are going to win in terms of layer two technology.

1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:24.240
 Specifically, you wrote, in general, my own view is that the, in the short term, optimistic

1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:28.720
 rollups, as you were saying, are likely to win out of general purpose EVM computation

1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:36.320
 and ZK rollups are likely to win out for simple payments, exchange and other application

1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:41.640
 specific use cases, just as you were saying, but in the medium to long term, ZK rollups

1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:49.160
 will win out in all use cases as ZK snark technology improves.

1:16:49.160 --> 1:16:56.960
 Why do you think ZK rollups are going to win the big picture battle over layer two technologies?

1:16:56.960 --> 1:17:03.400
 So I think ZK rollups, like once you accept that the technology works are just like conceptually

1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:05.600
 simpler and they have nicer properties.

1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:09.080
 The reason is that they do not have this concept of a challenge game, right?

1:17:09.080 --> 1:17:13.760
 Like as I mentioned in an optimistic rollup, the way that you ensure that the results are

1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:17.520
 correct is that you let one person submit and like they just submit with no proof.

1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:19.880
 They just say, here's what I think the result is.

1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:23.520
 And then if someone else disagrees, they make their own submission and then if you have

1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:27.700
 two disagreeing submissions, then you actually publish it on chain and you see who's right.

1:17:27.700 --> 1:17:32.240
 But for this to work, like you need to actually wait for someone to disagree, right?

1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:36.480
 So like, for example, if I have an asset inside of an optimistic rollup and I want to withdraw

1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:42.160
 it, then I actually have to wait a week to withdraw it because like if the block that

1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:45.960
 contains my withdrawal turned out to be invalid, then there needs to be space for someone to

1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:46.960
 disagree with it.

1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:47.960
 Right?

1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:50.640
 Whereas with a ZK rollup, like you don't need time for disagreeing because you just have

1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:51.640
 a proof, right?

1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:55.960
 As soon as a block is submitted, there's a proof and like, you know, it's correct.

1:17:55.960 --> 1:18:02.280
 So disagreements, especially in the long term or sparse, then then you don't want to do the

1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:04.680
 optimistic, the game theoretic thing.

1:18:04.680 --> 1:18:05.680
 You want to do the ZK snark.

1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:06.680
 Right.

1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:11.760
 The ZK stuff is just like, you can win a ZK rollup, you can withdraw immediately.

1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:16.080
 You don't have to like worry about the economics of proving as much, right?

1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:18.400
 There's just like fewer issues.

1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:22.920
 The reason why ZK rollups are not winning everywhere today is because, you know, ZK

1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:25.120
 snark is still a crazy new technology, right?

1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:29.400
 Like this is something that 10 years ago, you know, it existed only in theory and there

1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:31.480
 was none in practice.

1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:35.440
 Then, you know, eight years ago, people were just getting excited about it in Bitcoin conferences

1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:41.840
 for the first time, like four years, starting four years ago or three and a half years ago

1:18:41.840 --> 1:18:47.000
 even, that was the first time you were able to make any ZK snark based anything on Ethereum.

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:51.720
 And then people started making them and ZK technology has only really become efficient

1:18:51.720 --> 1:18:55.960
 enough to do a lot of things within the past maybe one and a half years.

1:18:55.960 --> 1:18:59.320
 So it's, it's new technology.

1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:00.560
 It's crazy technology.

1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:03.000
 It's admittedly scary technology.

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:06.440
 If you want to learn more, I also have an article about this on Vitalik.ca.

1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:08.360
 It's actually really, really good.

1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:14.000
 You're, most of your writing, it's a, it goes, it's technical, but it's accessible.

1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:18.600
 I highly, highly recommend to check out Vitalik's articles and blogs, whatever, whatever you

1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:19.600
 call them.

1:19:19.600 --> 1:19:20.600
 Yeah.

1:19:20.600 --> 1:19:22.840
 It's brilliant summary of the work.

1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:25.640
 Actually Ethereum documentation period is really good.

1:19:25.640 --> 1:19:30.360
 I think that's somewhat crowdsourced that that documentation is really, really accessible

1:19:30.360 --> 1:19:32.760
 and brilliant.

1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:39.520
 So let me ask about sort of other approaches to layer two, like side chains.

1:19:39.520 --> 1:19:42.560
 So the one popular one is polygon.

1:19:42.560 --> 1:19:48.160
 What are your thoughts about polygon, which is a layer two network?

1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:49.760
 Is it positive?

1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:51.240
 Is it negative for Ethereum?

1:19:51.240 --> 1:19:52.240
 Is it both?

1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:53.400
 Does it have a future?

1:19:53.400 --> 1:19:58.360
 Which is its own chain, but it's using Ethereum.

1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:02.640
 It's like based on Ethereum, essentially, or maybe you can describe what it is.

1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:07.920
 So I think there's a really big and important difference in security models between rollups

1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:13.240
 and side chains, which is basically that a rollups inherit from the security of Ethereum.

1:20:13.240 --> 1:20:20.240
 So like if I have coins inside of a loop ring or optimism or arbitrage room or ZK sync,

1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:24.960
 then even if everyone else in the world who is participating in these ecosystems, so like

1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:31.000
 hates me and wants to steal my money, I can still personally make sure that no matter

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.640
 what happens, I get my money out.

1:20:33.640 --> 1:20:37.040
 It might be a bit expensive for me to get my money out and I have to do transactions

1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:39.840
 on the main chain, but I'll be able to do it.

1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:45.240
 Whereas in polygon, which is a side chain, and so instead of being secured by Ethereum,

1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:50.400
 it's also in part secured by its own proof of stake consensus with its own token.

1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:57.200
 So if 70% of the whole or even 51% of the holders of polygon tokens wanted to take my

1:20:57.200 --> 1:20:59.560
 money in polygon, they can.

1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:06.880
 So that's the, and like to be fair, like there aren't even like the supply, I don't think

1:21:06.880 --> 1:21:08.680
 is even that widely distributed, right?

1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:15.120
 So like potentially you could, this idea of 51% of the token holders coming together

1:21:15.120 --> 1:21:19.560
 and stealing everything, like it's not impossible, right?

1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:21.680
 Where does the scaling of polygon come from?

1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:28.400
 Like why is it able to process much more transactions than the Ethereum main chain?

1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:29.560
 What's the idea there?

1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:35.200
 I think in part, I imagine, I'm not sure exactly what its capacity level is, but like I imagine

1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:40.760
 it has a higher capacity because it's a bit more willing to take centralization tradeoffs.

1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:45.840
 And then another thing is that like if the Ethereum ecosystem, like even if it did not

1:21:45.840 --> 1:21:46.840
 do that, right?

1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:50.840
 If you think about an Ethereum ecosystem hypothetically scaling with side chains, then you would have

1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:54.320
 a hundred copies of polygon and you know, they would each have their own tokens, they

1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:55.760
 would each have their own chains.

1:21:55.760 --> 1:22:00.440
 And so even if each one of those chains was only as scalable as Ethereum, you know, you

1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:07.720
 could still, like the total sum of them would still be a hundred times more than Ethereum.

1:22:07.720 --> 1:22:12.520
 The thing that I want to say in Polygon's favor just to be very fair to them, like,

1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:17.040
 I really, you know, I definitely really, you know, respect the work that they're doing.

1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:23.640
 So, you know, start with a bit with that word of not criticism caution, right?

1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:30.520
 Like it's that they made this kind of deliberate tradeoff for very pragmatic reasons, which

1:22:30.520 --> 1:22:33.240
 is that the Ethereum ecosystem needs to scale now.

1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:36.360
 And there are applications that want to do something now.

1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:40.360
 And you know, if there aren't Ethereum friendly options for them, then like they're not going

1:22:40.360 --> 1:22:42.640
 to just wait peacefully and do nothing for 12 months.

1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:48.200
 And they're going to go to, you know, either Binance Smart Chain or, you know, one of some

1:22:48.200 --> 1:22:53.360
 other system or potentially something that just has totally no alignment with Ethereum

1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:55.400
 values whatsoever.

1:22:55.400 --> 1:23:00.200
 But whereas, you know, with Polygon, like the best thing that you can say in Polygon's

1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:05.040
 favor and against optimism is that, you know, optimism is not live and Polygon is live,

1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:06.040
 right?

1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:12.540
 Like it just takes more work to create a system that has these extra rollups, security features.

1:23:12.540 --> 1:23:16.400
 And so Polygon just said, we're going to be the system that makes the pragmatic tradeoff.

1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:21.280
 We're going to go, you know, functionality first and then, you know, we can talk about

1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:23.080
 adding back the security later.

1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:28.400
 So I've talked to them and like in principle, I think they're very, you know, open to the

1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:37.480
 idea of like adding more security and becoming a rollup or at least adding a Polygon chain

1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:41.360
 that's a rollup at some point in the future, which is definitely something I think they

1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:44.360
 can, you know, absolutely should follow through on.

1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:50.320
 But the fact that like they exist now and so, you know, applications can kind of bootstrap

1:23:50.320 --> 1:23:54.400
 now on a chain that, you know, even though its security isn't perfect, at least it exists

1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:55.840
 and people can go use it.

1:23:55.840 --> 1:24:00.920
 And then over time, you know, the chain matures as the applications mature, like, you know,

1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:04.880
 I think of a very reasonable strategy and I'm definitely, you know, really happy that

1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:06.880
 they're part of the ecosystem.

1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:09.800
 Yeah, it's kind of interesting.

1:24:09.800 --> 1:24:17.240
 The history of cryptocurrency has this tension of really good ideas that are hard to implement.

1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:23.560
 So they take longer to implement and ideas that are not as good, but are faster to implement.

1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:28.280
 This is like the story of like, you have like JavaScript that basically took over the world

1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:31.640
 because it was quick to implement within 10 days.

1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:35.080
 And then like later kept fixing itself.

1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:40.520
 I don't know what to make of that, sort of from the engineering perspective, I'm more

1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:45.360
 and more becoming comfortable and accepting the fact that our whole world will run a technology

1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:51.960
 that's not as good as it could have been just because the crappy solution is faster to implement

1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:52.960
 and it sticks.

1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:55.160
 What do you make of that tension?

1:24:55.160 --> 1:25:00.520
 I think the compromise that we've been taking within Ethereum is like when we have to take

1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:05.440
 the crappy solution, we look for crappy solutions that are forward compatible with becoming

1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:07.440
 good over time, right?

1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:12.600
 Like when you build the quick and dirty thing, like you would still already have ideas in

1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:17.320
 your head about what the more complete thing with all the security features added on would

1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:18.320
 look like, right?

1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:20.120
 Even if it requires a hard fork?

1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:21.120
 Yes.

1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:24.440
 Like even so, like for example, we're sharding, right?

1:25:24.440 --> 1:25:28.840
 Like, yeah, I think it's the likely that the first version of sharding that comes out like

1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:32.960
 is not going to have, you know, ZK start send data availability sampling, for example.

1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:34.920
 But we know what these technologies are.

1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:37.840
 We feel like we, you know, have wrapped our heads around them.

1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:42.800
 And so we know how to build a system where we can put all the pieces in place so that

1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:46.720
 it becomes very easy to bolt those components on in the future.

1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:49.120
 So like if you do things that way, right?

1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:54.600
 Then at the beginning, you can have your system that has the functionality, but say has less

1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:58.280
 security or like less sustainability or less of something else.

1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:04.040
 But then over time, like it's designed in such a way that it has this easy on ramp to

1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:05.040
 adding those things.

1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:09.400
 Right, and if you don't think explicitly about like being future compatible, then you do

1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:14.280
 often end up with a quick and dirty solution that backs you into a corner.

1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:17.920
 And then there are definitely cases where like, I think the Ethereum ecosystem has suffered

1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:18.920
 from that.

1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:25.520
 And we have had to like expand pretty significant effort on, for example, removing features

1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:29.080
 that we didn't realize that we actually can't sustain.

1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:30.080
 Right.

1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:32.960
 Like one big example is just increasing the, yeah, the gas costs.

1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:37.640
 So like making some operations more expensive when they, because they should be expensive

1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:40.560
 because they actually take a lot of time in the process.

1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:46.860
 So that's making something's more expensive, kind of like taking some functionality away.

1:26:46.860 --> 1:26:52.240
 So if you can like be cognizant of where you're likely going into the future.

1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:55.520
 And if you don't know, like even be cognizant of both the most likely paths that you'll

1:26:55.520 --> 1:27:00.320
 take in the future and coming, like thinking about your roadmap and coming up with a roadmap

1:27:00.320 --> 1:27:05.000
 where you know that like if you want to do either of those things, then you have a clean

1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:06.760
 path toward it.

1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:10.600
 That's probably the best kind of practical way to get the best of Worthworlds that we

1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:11.600
 have.

1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:12.600
 Okay.

1:27:12.600 --> 1:27:17.440
 Let's talk about this wonderful process of merging.

1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:19.720
 Okay.

1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:27.440
 So there's the main net, which is the Ethereum 1.0 chain or the chain, what should we say?

1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:31.120
 The chain that uses proof of work as a consensus mechanism.

1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:34.040
 And then there is what is it called?

1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:41.000
 The beacon chain that uses the proof of stake mechanism.

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:46.120
 And I believe the beacon has been deployed successfully is working.

1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:48.120
 So that was in December of 2020.

1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:51.760
 There's a bunch of questions around that that's fascinating as well.

1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:58.800
 But I think the most fascinating question is about merging those two.

1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:06.640
 When do the two chains, one that's proof of work, one that's proof of stake, merge?

1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:09.680
 And what are the most difficult parts of this process?

1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:10.680
 Right.

1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:15.560
 So as you've said, right, the way that we have set up this proof of stake transition

1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:19.680
 is that at first the proof of stake chain just launches on its own, right?

1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:22.480
 And this is the thing that happened in December.

1:28:22.480 --> 1:28:28.280
 And the proof of stake chain has been running for close to six months now.

1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:33.200
 I mean, by the time people watch this, it might actually be six months.

1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:37.600
 But it isn't actually coming to consensus on anything except for itself, right?

1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:43.560
 So the idea behind that is to just give the proof of stake chain time to mature, time

1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:48.280
 for people to build the ecosystem around it, time to make sure that there aren't any bugs.

1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:54.800
 And just prove to the community that proof of stake actually is real and a full transition

1:28:54.800 --> 1:28:58.800
 is realistic because the thing that you're transitioning to already exists and already

1:28:58.800 --> 1:28:59.800
 works.

1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:03.600
 And then at some point in the future, you have this event called the merge where you

1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:08.160
 basically take the activity that's being done inside of the proof of work chain and

1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:11.520
 you actually move it over into the proof of stake chain so you get rid of the proof of

1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:13.560
 work side completely.

1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:22.120
 So the way that the merge will work is, it's definitely gone through a few different iterations.

1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:27.160
 Like the earlier versions of this actually required more work for users and more work

1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:28.160
 for clients.

1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:32.520
 It was much more like, oh, there's this new chain, there's this old chain, and then everyone

1:29:32.520 --> 1:29:34.960
 has to like migrate from the old chain to the new chain.

1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:37.480
 And then at some point, we'll forget about the old chain.

1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:43.600
 The new version is designed to be much more seamless for users.

1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:49.720
 So basically what actually happens is that the old chain basically becomes embedded inside

1:29:49.720 --> 1:29:51.000
 the new chain.

1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:57.160
 So starting from the merge transition block, every proof of stake chain block is going

1:29:57.160 --> 1:30:04.040
 to contain a block of what we consider to be the Ethereum chain today, but we'll call

1:30:04.040 --> 1:30:05.840
 it the execution chain.

1:30:05.840 --> 1:30:09.360
 And then at the same time, to create one of these blocks, you're not going to need proof

1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:11.000
 of work anymore.

1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:14.920
 So basically at the same time, you would both get rid of the proof of work requirements

1:30:14.920 --> 1:30:20.120
 for one of these blocks to be valid, but instead you require these blocks to be embedded inside

1:30:20.120 --> 1:30:21.600
 of the proof of stake blocks.

1:30:21.600 --> 1:30:24.360
 So you basically have like a chain inside a chain.

1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:30.320
 And this is, from an architecture perspective, you might think it's a little bit suboptimal,

1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:34.320
 but it actually has some nice properties and makes it easier to kind of think about the

1:30:34.320 --> 1:30:39.080
 consensus and think about the, what we call the execution layer, like transactions and

1:30:39.080 --> 1:30:43.360
 contracts kind of separately and upgrade them separately.

1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:48.000
 And it also just means that the upgrade process is extremely seamless, right?

1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:51.280
 Because from the point of view of a client that's following the chain, you basically

1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:53.560
 have to update nothing, right?

1:30:53.560 --> 1:30:58.120
 You're still following the same chain and follows the same rules, except instead of checking

1:30:58.120 --> 1:31:02.200
 proof of work, you'll switch to checking that these blocks are embedded inside of blocks

1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:03.360
 of the proof of stake chain.

1:31:03.360 --> 1:31:08.400
 So there'll be this merge block that will mark this transition.

1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:14.480
 And over time, I guess the new chain will contain the full record of all the transactions

1:31:14.480 --> 1:31:17.640
 that's ever happened on the previous chain, on the old chain.

1:31:17.640 --> 1:31:24.680
 So maybe I'm asking a dumb question here, but in this process, is the new chain going

1:31:24.680 --> 1:31:29.160
 to have all the information of the past transactions?

1:31:29.160 --> 1:31:35.800
 The new chain is not going to hold information from what happened in the Ethereum chain before

1:31:35.800 --> 1:31:37.000
 the merge, right?

1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:44.880
 So like Ethereum clients that people are going to use around the time of the merge and soon

1:31:44.880 --> 1:31:49.760
 after the merge, they're probably just going to sync and check the proof of work chain

1:31:49.760 --> 1:31:52.720
 up to the merge, and then they're going to check the proof of stake chain, but at some

1:31:52.720 --> 1:31:55.920
 point in the future, I think people will just stop bothering checking the proof of work

1:31:55.920 --> 1:31:56.920
 before the merge.

1:31:56.920 --> 1:31:57.920
 Got it.

1:31:57.920 --> 1:32:02.320
 So that old history information is not important for the future.

1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:09.000
 Like if you're operating actively on the new chain, that history is not important to you.

1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:10.880
 It's not important.

1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:18.720
 So it's not strictly important for just like any smart contract or just like applications

1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:20.000
 that run on the blockchain.

1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:24.360
 It can be important to users and it can be important for some applications, but we're

1:32:24.360 --> 1:32:30.000
 basically saying that like maintaining and serving that is not going to be simultaneously

1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:32.320
 the responsibility of every Ethereum node.

1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:36.480
 If you want that information, there can be separate protocols for backing it up.

1:32:36.480 --> 1:32:38.520
 And like these other protocols actually exist, right?

1:32:38.520 --> 1:32:42.600
 Like there's something called the graph, which is doing some history retrieval.

1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:45.200
 Potentially you can just take that entire chain and stake it on BitTorrent.

1:32:45.200 --> 1:32:50.280
 Like there's lots of ways to like archive it and create kind of customized search protocols

1:32:50.280 --> 1:32:51.280
 for it.

1:32:51.280 --> 1:32:57.720
 So what's your sense why, so there's a Python 2 and Python 3 and it took forever for people

1:32:57.720 --> 1:32:59.020
 to switch.

1:32:59.020 --> 1:33:05.360
 What's your sense why this merge has been taking longer than perhaps was expected?

1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:11.160
 I think the biggest reason is just we've been underestimating the technical complexity.

1:33:11.160 --> 1:33:14.680
 There's a lot of technical complexity in making a successful proof of stake chain.

1:33:14.680 --> 1:33:21.120
 There's a lot of technical complexity in actually figuring out the transition process.

1:33:21.120 --> 1:33:24.920
 So that's bigger than social complexity.

1:33:24.920 --> 1:33:29.880
 So the technical complexity, you would say is the bigger reason for the any delays than

1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:31.120
 the social complexity.

1:33:31.120 --> 1:33:36.680
 I actually think so, I think we've been very fortunate to not have too much social complexity

1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:37.680
 around the merge.

1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:39.160
 So not much drama.

1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:40.160
 No.

1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:45.160
 I think the biggest part of the reason is just because we have been talking about proof

1:33:45.160 --> 1:33:49.120
 of stake and sharding as being part of the roadmap since almost the very beginning of

1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:50.120
 the project.

1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:56.560
 Like the very first proof of stake blog post from January 2014, which was two months after

1:33:56.560 --> 1:34:01.760
 the project started and maybe even a day after the announcement.

1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:09.360
 So proof of stake was not something that we kind of put on anybody by surprise.

1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:14.120
 And then when the Dow fork happened and the people on the ETC side split off, I think

1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:18.720
 it also just happens that a lot of the people that were not willing to stomach the Dow fork

1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:24.280
 and the join the ETC side, they were the more Bitcoin types and the more Bitcoin types do

1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:26.920
 also tends to like proof of work more.

1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:33.280
 And so that also sort of ended up purifying the communities on both sides, I guess.

1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:38.760
 So Ethereum Classic is not switching to proof of stake and they're happy with their setup.

1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:46.600
 And by the time that it came to the beacon chain launching and now I think the community

1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:49.880
 is very strongly in favor of the proof of stake switch.

1:34:49.880 --> 1:35:00.200
 But let me ask the question that no engineer wants to hear, which is the question of timeline.

1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:02.920
 When do you think the merge will happen?

1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:05.960
 Do you have a sense it might happen this year?

1:35:05.960 --> 1:35:14.600
 Do you have a sense it might be pushed towards next year, 2022 or even beyond?

1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:20.880
 I think early 2022 is the most realistic.

1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:26.120
 There's definitely still an optimistic case of it happening this year, but the realistic

1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:31.480
 thing to count on is definitely the early part of next year.

1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:37.880
 Is there specific things that stand out to you that make you feel good about progress

1:35:37.880 --> 1:35:40.600
 if you see it happening?

1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:46.720
 So the thing that we had last month is we had this online hackathon called Rayonism

1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:51.440
 where basically a bunch of the different client developers that are going to be part of the

1:35:51.440 --> 1:35:57.640
 transition like hacks together some test nets of the post merge Ethereum chain.

1:35:57.640 --> 1:36:01.120
 So these were only test nets of what would happen after the merge.

1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:03.440
 There were not test nets of the transition itself.

1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:08.400
 So the thing that people are working on now actually is the transition.

1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:14.720
 So having a full specification of both the transition and post transition.

1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:20.080
 We have specifications now, but in a realistic way, they'll probably need to have a couple

1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:23.400
 of changes and have things that continue to be ironed out.

1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:28.040
 And then have a test net that does both the transition and the post transition.

1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:33.640
 And then once you have a test network, then you just have to do a lot of testing and audited.

1:36:33.640 --> 1:36:39.480
 And then do some runs on not just a specialized test network, but on, say, an existing test

1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:45.680
 network like Robson or Rinkeby that Ethereum people already significantly use.

1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:49.680
 And if it works, then you can deploy the transition on mainnet.

1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:52.400
 Just as a quick comment, because this is fascinating.

1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:59.600
 In August of last year, there was this medalla, I believe it's pronounced Medasha.

1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:02.080
 It's a South American subway station.

1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:03.080
 I forget where.

1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:04.480
 But spelled the two L's.

1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:05.480
 Yeah.

1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:06.480
 Yeah.

1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:07.480
 Cause that's, you know, that's how Spanish works.

1:37:07.480 --> 1:37:08.480
 Right.

1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:09.480
 Like the two L's have.

1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:10.480
 Medasha.

1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:11.480
 Yeah.

1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:12.480
 Okay.

1:37:12.480 --> 1:37:13.480
 Cool.

1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:16.640
 Anyway, but I read about it in middle of August, August 14th, there was an incident

1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:18.920
 on that test net.

1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:21.480
 What, how does this process work?

1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:25.680
 Like, what do you learn from those kinds of incidents when stuff goes wrong in the test

1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:27.680
 process?

1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:33.040
 I think that incident was that there was a consensus failure of some kind, as I remember

1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:37.080
 basically, just different clients interpreting things in different ways.

1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:39.520
 And then one of them getting kicked off the network.

1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:45.080
 And then it ended up taking a while to actually like get everyone to get back online.

1:37:45.080 --> 1:37:49.880
 Like a big part of the reason why it took weeks to resolve, right, is because it's

1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:52.200
 on a test network, like the coins are valuable.

1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:57.400
 And so there's not really this big push of any kind for people to actually, you know,

1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:00.560
 going down with a new client so they can start participating again.

1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:05.320
 And so, you know, it definitely took a while until the chain started finalizing again.

1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:12.080
 But and then also, like there was, I think, another round of just not finalizing in October,

1:38:12.080 --> 1:38:17.320
 as I remember that, I mean, there were definitely things that we learned.

1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:21.640
 Like there were a lot of things, especially that client developers just learned about

1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:28.640
 like optimization and how to build their clients in a way that they can process things efficiently.

1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:32.840
 There's a lot that we learned from just like seeing the full life cycle of what happens

1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:37.280
 when more than a third of the validators go offline and then finalization stops.

1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:43.560
 And then that kind of weird, unusual state of the chain continues for a while.

1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:48.920
 And then eventually everyone who is not participating just gets enough of their stake.

1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:52.520
 Like, we don't use the word slash, we use the word leaked for this, but like basically

1:38:52.520 --> 1:38:57.000
 also burned until, you know, the people who are participating go back up to two thirds

1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.760
 and then the chain goes back to finalizing.

1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:04.520
 So just seeing all of those edge cases play out live, I think actually helped a lot and

1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:08.800
 probably helped to really contribute to making us feel better about mainnet.

1:39:08.800 --> 1:39:17.800
 I mean, there's also an incident just recently in April 24th of 2021, where this was on Beacon,

1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:23.720
 I guess, there was a bug discovered in the software client prism that prevented roughly

1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:28.600
 70% of validators on the network from producing blocks.

1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:34.760
 I mean, maybe you can comment on what happened, but broadly, like the big picture, what kind

1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:39.440
 of stuff are you worried about in terms of problems that might arise?

1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:46.960
 I was talking about small bugs, I was talking about like emergent, social, unexpected social

1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:47.960
 bugs.

1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:51.680
 You know, what are the things that worry you about the future of Ethereum that you want

1:39:51.680 --> 1:39:55.560
 to make sure you construct mechanisms that prevent those things from happening?

1:39:55.560 --> 1:40:00.560
 So one of the lucky things there was that this particular bug only prevented, proposed

1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:03.440
 those self blocks, it did not prevent attestations.

1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:06.520
 So attestations is just a mechanism for voting on blocks.

1:40:06.520 --> 1:40:09.960
 And it's the attestations that are actually responsible for the chain finalizing.

1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:13.040
 So like coming to this more permanent agreement on blocks, right?

1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:19.080
 So the chain was actually quite stable all the way through.

1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:25.600
 I think the thing that we generally learn from these experiences is just how valuable

1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:28.600
 it is to have this multi client network.

1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:32.560
 So this is one of these areas where I think Ethereum distinguishes itself from like Bitcoin,

1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:33.800
 for example, right?

1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:41.800
 That in Ethereum, we don't have one single client that everyone just runs, right?

1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:44.680
 There's multiple implementations of the protocol.

1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:50.200
 And these multiple implementations, they all process and verify the blocks that each other

1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:52.600
 can verify, right?

1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:54.120
 So they all speak the same language.

1:40:54.120 --> 1:40:56.960
 Now, sometimes when there's a bug, they disagree.

1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:01.360
 And when two clients disagree because of a bug, we call this a consensus failure.

1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:03.480
 And consensus failures are pretty serious, right?

1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:11.440
 And when you have clients monoculture like Bitcoin does, then it's more rare to have

1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:12.440
 consensus failures.

1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:15.960
 You still have them, actually, Bitcoin had a consensus failure between two different

1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:19.520
 versions of the same client back in 2013.

1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:22.080
 But they're less likely to happen.

1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:27.480
 But the interesting thing is that the multi client architecture has actually, I think,

1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:30.200
 saved Ethereum much more than it's heard it.

1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:32.040
 So even in this most recent incident, right?

1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:34.800
 Like Prism was not producing blocks, but all the other clients were still producing

1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:35.800
 blocks.

1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:38.040
 There's four others, right?

1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:39.040
 Yes.

1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:43.480
 Prism, Nimbus, Tecru, and the Lighthouse.

1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:49.560
 And then also Ethereum back in 2016 had this fun event that we call the Shanghai DOS attacks.

1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:56.320
 They're called that because the attacks started right on the first day of our annual conference

1:41:56.320 --> 1:41:59.480
 at DEF CON that happens to be in Shanghai that year.

1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:06.040
 So what happened basically was that someone came up with a way to create blocks that were

1:42:06.040 --> 1:42:10.280
 very slow for one client to process, but not the other client.

1:42:10.280 --> 1:42:13.280
 So at that time, there were basically two Ethereum clients.

1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:15.200
 They were called Geth and Parity.

1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:20.920
 Right now, I think the top three ones are Geth, Nethermind, and Beisu.

1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:25.160
 But what happened as a result of us having two clients is that the attacker was just

1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:32.360
 not able to come up with blocks that both clients were completely failing at processing.

1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:36.020
 And so a lot of the miners and a lot of network participants, they just kept on switching

1:42:36.020 --> 1:42:39.920
 between the two implementations depending on which one worked, and that actually really

1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:48.240
 helped the chain survive through that month of attacks as the attacker just kept on hammering

1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:54.520
 at our system and identifying all of the weaknesses and just forcing our clients to do this rapid

1:42:54.520 --> 1:43:01.920
 sprint of just optimizing the hell out of everything and make sure there aren't any of those DOS

1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:02.920
 bugs remaining.

1:43:02.920 --> 1:43:09.520
 So that was another example, and then as a counter example, so something that also shows

1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:16.120
 the point from the other side, Bitcoin had this bug in 2010, the balanced overflow bug.

1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:23.040
 Basically someone created a transaction that had two outputs, and those outputs were both

1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:28.040
 of a few billion Bitcoin, so about two to the power of 63 Satoshis.

1:43:28.040 --> 1:43:32.000
 And then if you add those numbers together, you'll go above to the power of 64.

1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:37.040
 And of course, computers, once you go above to the power of 64, you wrap around.

1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:41.600
 And so the Bitcoin nodes thought that there was enough money to pay for the transaction

1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:45.000
 because it was asking for, let's say, a billion Satoshis or something, but actually it was

1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:48.240
 asking for to the power of 64 plus a billion.

1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:53.440
 And so the attacker just managed to create billions of Bitcoin out of thin air.

1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:59.980
 And this was not only discovered and fixed after something like 12 hours.

1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:08.120
 But if Bitcoin had been a multiple implementation system, then what almost certainly happened

1:44:08.120 --> 1:44:13.600
 is one of the clients would have bugged out, but the other clients would have probably

1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:15.160
 actually had a check for that.

1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:21.400
 And so there would have been a consensus failure, but at least that would have alerted everyone

1:44:21.400 --> 1:44:24.320
 that there is a problem very quickly.

1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:29.280
 And it also would have given everyone just obvious social permission to go and pick whichever

1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:32.080
 one of the chains is correct and solve the problem.

1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:39.280
 So that's, I think, a big learning that we've had from multiple of our experiences in the

1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:43.040
 Ethereum ecosystem, just like validating this multi client model.

1:44:43.040 --> 1:44:47.160
 And to be fair, it's a model that we get criticized for a lot.

1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:50.920
 Bitcoin people talk about the risk of consensus failures that this creates.

1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:55.760
 VC types are like, well, isn't it expensive and wasteful to fund three software teams

1:44:55.760 --> 1:44:59.520
 where you could just be making one quote focused effort?

1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:03.800
 They love the word focused and Ethereum is not that, but it's amazing, despite not being

1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:08.800
 that.

1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:12.680
 Basically, yeah, so that was interesting.

1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:18.160
 And then there have definitely been other learnings as well, just from seeing the chain

1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:24.840
 live and seeing what actually is the staking experience, like what are the actual incentives

1:45:24.840 --> 1:45:26.600
 for all the different participants.

1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:31.440
 So I definitely feel like we're gaining a lot from this sort of one year of trial running

1:45:31.440 --> 1:45:35.720
 the chain before we actually make all of Ethereum depend on it.

1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:41.200
 Let me ask perhaps a strange question, but proponents of Bitcoin will say things like

1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:44.200
 Bitcoin fixes everything.

1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:54.560
 So why do we need Ethereum versus like Bitcoin plus Lightning Network for scalability?

1:45:54.560 --> 1:45:58.760
 And then using Bitcoin with this proof of work for security.

1:45:58.760 --> 1:46:04.160
 So it is perhaps sort of a strange question, but it's a high level question.

1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:06.760
 Why do we need another technology?

1:46:06.760 --> 1:46:13.360
 Yes, it has a bunch of nice features, but doesn't Bitcoin fix everything already?

1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:20.400
 So the thing that always attracted me about Bitcoin is these values of decentralization

1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:25.600
 and creating these open, provisional systems that anyone can participate in and that aren't

1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:31.240
 just going to flop over and die if whoever created them gets bored and that are resistant

1:46:31.240 --> 1:46:35.560
 to whoever runs them, breaking the rules and all of these things.

1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:40.560
 And I think that pretty strongly that these principles are really valid and important

1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:43.000
 to much more things than just money.

1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:48.160
 Bitcoin is the blockchain for money and Ethereum is built from the start as a general purpose

1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:49.880
 blockchain.

1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:54.760
 There is ether of the asset on Ethereum, but then you can also make decentralized financial

1:46:54.760 --> 1:46:58.440
 things, what we call DeFi today.

1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:02.400
 You can make like ENS, the decentralized domain name system.

1:47:02.400 --> 1:47:05.200
 You can make prediction markets on it.

1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:12.200
 You can make totally nonfinancial systems that just keep track of whether or not some

1:47:12.200 --> 1:47:18.640
 certificate was signed or whether or not some cryptographic key got revoked.

1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:24.120
 This big long list of just interesting things that you could use about blockchains to do.

1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:30.160
 Basically, they are sort of the missing piece that we are without them, the kinds of things

1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:32.960
 that a decentralized computer network can do as we are limited.

1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:39.040
 And once you have them, a lot of those limitations end up going away.

1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:43.160
 So Ethereum was always from the beginning about that.

1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:46.120
 It's about, hey, this isn't just money.

1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:51.120
 There's so much more that you could do if you could just go ahead and make any infrastructure

1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:57.920
 or digital institution or DAO or whatever you want to call it, where the base layer

1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:02.160
 of the logic is just executed in this open and transparent way where everyone can see

1:48:02.160 --> 1:48:03.600
 what's going on.

1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:07.000
 Or if you like your zero knowledge proofs, at least everyone can see proofs that prove

1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:13.160
 to you that what's going on follows the rules and you don't need to just constantly keep

1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:15.480
 trusting centralized actors.

1:48:15.480 --> 1:48:21.440
 Hence, the smart contracts as being a core technology as part of Ethereum.

1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:22.440
 Yes, exactly.

1:48:22.440 --> 1:48:26.760
 Smart contracts, the computer programs that are running on Ethereum, they are the core

1:48:26.760 --> 1:48:29.800
 of what makes Ethereum general purpose.

1:48:29.800 --> 1:48:37.440
 So I do think that there's a lot more wrong with the world than just money.

1:48:37.440 --> 1:48:42.560
 I'm not one of these people who thinks that if you get rid of fiat currency and you replace

1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:46.680
 it with cryptocurrency, then suddenly wars are going to go away because, like, first

1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:51.520
 of all, like, seniorized revenue is only a small portion of government revenue.

1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:54.680
 It's like what, 5%, 10%, something like that.

1:48:54.680 --> 1:49:00.240
 Second of all, if you are the sort of, this is one of the things I don't even get about

1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:01.240
 their philosophy.

1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:06.440
 Let's say you're the sort of person who is an extreme and very distrusting libertarian

1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:10.120
 and you think that these governments are terrible.

1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:16.880
 We know today that governments find a combination of things like welfare and things like the

1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:22.320
 military that goes and bombs people in Afghanistan.

1:49:22.320 --> 1:49:30.000
 So the question you have to ask is, okay, you, with your new magic newfangled cyber

1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:34.520
 currency that takes over the world, take away the government's ability to have seniorized

1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:37.800
 revenue and so you reduce the government's revenue by 10%.

1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:43.080
 If the government is that evil, which portion of its expenses is it going to take that 10%

1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:44.080
 from?

1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:47.680
 Is it going to stop the bombing people in Afghanistan or is it going to cut welfare?

1:49:47.680 --> 1:49:51.640
 If you think it's the first, you have a very optimistic view of the government, right?

1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:59.880
 So that's, I guess, my perspective on, like, why the whole, you know, we're going to save

1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:06.440
 the world and create peace by, like, denying governments the right to stealth taxation kind

1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:09.560
 of perspective doesn't really make much sense for me.

1:50:09.560 --> 1:50:15.000
 And I do think that there is real value that comes from a decentralized and open currency,

1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:19.920
 like just the fact that there is a financial infrastructure that anyone in the world can,

1:50:19.920 --> 1:50:21.480
 you know, go ahead and use, right?

1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:25.760
 Like, it's, that's something that can easily be a big boon for people, right?

1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:33.200
 There's a lot of places where the currency is much less stable than the dollar.

1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:38.360
 And, you know, these people, like, well, if they use Bitcoin, their only option is to

1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:39.360
 get Bitcoins, right?

1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:42.200
 Which, you know, are also pretty volatile.

1:50:42.200 --> 1:50:45.040
 If they use Ethereum, then, you know, they can get Ether, but then they can also get

1:50:45.040 --> 1:50:46.240
 stablecoins, right?

1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:50.280
 And you might think that, you know, oh, you're not being ideologically pure, now you're giving

1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:53.760
 them stablecoins, which are mirroring dollars, and obviously, dollars are going to collapse

1:50:53.760 --> 1:50:54.760
 too.

1:50:54.760 --> 1:50:58.560
 But the reality is that dollars are vastly more stable than the Venezuelan Bolivar.

1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:05.520
 So, like, there are really, like, meaningful and beneficial things that you can give to

1:51:05.520 --> 1:51:09.200
 people by having a global and open financial system.

1:51:09.200 --> 1:51:13.120
 But I think if you want to actually do that, like, you have to have much more than just

1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:14.360
 a currency, right?

1:51:14.360 --> 1:51:19.200
 And then if you want to go beyond financial things, then, you know, you have to, obviously,

1:51:19.200 --> 1:51:21.000
 have much more than a currency.

1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:25.880
 And then, you know, you also have to actually take scalability seriously because nonfinancial

1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:31.240
 applications, like, nobody's going to pay $5 a transaction for them.

1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:33.240
 Can we return to dogs?

1:51:33.240 --> 1:51:34.240
 Sure.

1:51:34.240 --> 1:51:40.240
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:51:40.240 --> 1:51:41.920
 The other one's categorically forbidden?

1:51:41.920 --> 1:51:43.420
 Yeah, categorically forbidden.

1:51:43.420 --> 1:51:45.840
 Is there any cryptocurrency based on cats, actually?

1:51:45.840 --> 1:51:47.320
 I think there are.

1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:49.640
 Like, there was cat coin, there was NAND coin.

1:51:49.640 --> 1:51:53.080
 For some reason, they just didn't catch on as much as the dog coins did.

1:51:53.080 --> 1:51:58.240
 Okay, so let's talk about Dogecoin and Elon Musk.

1:51:58.240 --> 1:52:07.120
 Elon said that, quote, ideally Doge speeds up block time 10x, increases block size 10x,

1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:10.760
 and drops fee 100x.

1:52:10.760 --> 1:52:14.300
 Then it wins hands down, end quote.

1:52:14.300 --> 1:52:20.560
 You said in the blog post, partially responding to that, that there are subtle technical reasons

1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:23.840
 why this is not possible.

1:52:23.840 --> 1:52:30.520
 To this, Elon said that you, quote, fear the Doge.

1:52:30.520 --> 1:52:31.840
 So let's talk about this.

1:52:31.840 --> 1:52:37.200
 What are the technical hurdles for Dogecoin that prevent it from becoming one of the primary

1:52:37.200 --> 1:52:41.240
 cryptocurrencies of the world, and do you, in fact, fear the Doge?

1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:43.560
 I definitely feel obligated to correct the record.

1:52:43.560 --> 1:52:45.240
 I definitely do not fear the Doge.

1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:46.240
 Okay.

1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:47.240
 No, I love the Doge.

1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:51.800
 I actually visited the Doge in Japan a few years back.

1:52:51.800 --> 1:52:52.800
 She's an amazing dog.

1:52:52.800 --> 1:52:53.800
 She's still alive.

1:52:53.800 --> 1:52:54.800
 Wait.

1:52:54.800 --> 1:52:55.800
 The original Doge?

1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:56.800
 Yeah.

1:52:56.800 --> 1:52:57.800
 Wow.

1:52:57.800 --> 1:53:06.880
 We accept Doge every year for our annual DEF CON conferences.

1:53:06.880 --> 1:53:11.400
 I definitely don't think Ethereum is opposed to dog coins.

1:53:11.400 --> 1:53:16.120
 I kind of want to feel like Ethereum is at least a little bit in spirit itself a dog coin.

1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:24.120
 And then, as I mentioned, I love Doge, I bought a bunch of Doge, I still hold a bunch of Doge.

1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:30.080
 On the scalability question, the challenge basically is the limits, scalability, and

1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:32.020
 the tradeoffs with centralization.

1:53:32.020 --> 1:53:36.160
 If you just increase the parameters without doing anything else, then it just becomes

1:53:36.160 --> 1:53:41.160
 more and more difficult for people to validate the chain, and it just becomes more likely

1:53:41.160 --> 1:53:46.040
 that the chain becomes centralized and becomes vulnerable to all kinds of capture.

1:53:46.040 --> 1:53:50.920
 So does it need some of the Layer 2 technologies that we've been talking about?

1:53:50.920 --> 1:53:56.200
 I personally think that if Doge wants to somehow bridge through Ethereum and then people can

1:53:56.200 --> 1:54:01.680
 trade Doge thousands of times a second inside of looping, then that would be amazing.

1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:07.120
 If they want to just take ZK roll up style technology and just have thousands of transactions

1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:12.120
 a second on their own chain, then that would be a great outcome as well.

1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:16.640
 Is there ways for Ethereum and Dogecoin to work together?

1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:25.760
 Okay, so there's a power behind a person like Elon Musk pushing the development of a cryptocurrency.

1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:31.920
 Is there ways to leverage that power and that momentum to improve Ethereum, to improve some

1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:39.200
 of the sort of cryptocurrencies that are already technologically advanced and pushing forward

1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:41.360
 that kind of technology?

1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:45.320
 I definitely think there's room for...

1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:49.680
 You know that meme of Doge taking over that storm?

1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:50.680
 Yes, I've seen it.

1:54:50.680 --> 1:54:57.120
 Is there a way to ride that storm, that wave of the Doge that's taken over?

1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:02.160
 I think if we could have a secure Doge to Ethereum bridge, then that would be amazing.

1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:07.120
 Then when Ethereum gets its scalability, any scalability thing that works for Ethereum

1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:11.920
 assets, you would be able to also trade wrapped Doge with extremely low transaction fees and

1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:14.160
 very high speed as well.

1:55:14.160 --> 1:55:19.320
 Is there precedence for building secure bridges between cryptocurrencies?

1:55:19.320 --> 1:55:21.320
 How difficult is this kind of task?

1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:24.080
 It's definitely something that's in its infancy.

1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:28.760
 There definitely have been some cross chain interaction things that have been done before.

1:55:28.760 --> 1:55:32.880
 The early assist is probably the concept of merge mining when a chain just makes its

1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:39.120
 entire proof of work algorithm dependent on the proof of work algorithm of another chain.

1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:44.080
 I think famous Dogecoin actually merge mines to Litecoin, which is I think in retrospect

1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:51.120
 not looking like a very good choice because now Dogecoin is bigger than Litecoin.

1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:58.000
 If there's potentially some way for Dogecoin to merge mine with an Ethereum proof of stake

1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:04.320
 in some kinds, then that could be an interesting alternative.

1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:06.640
 So that's one type of chain interaction.

1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:11.000
 As far as bridges, one chain reading another chain, early in Ethereum's history, there

1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.120
 was this project called BTC Relay.

1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:16.960
 It's a smart contract on Ethereum that just verifies Bitcoin blocks.

1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:21.640
 I think people stopped really caring about and maintaining it because there just weren't

1:56:21.640 --> 1:56:26.640
 enough applications that were actually interested in using it at the time and then the transaction

1:56:26.640 --> 1:56:29.160
 fees got too high to actually maintain it.

1:56:29.160 --> 1:56:35.880
 So I think if we want to make a BTC Relay 2.0 and that becomes cheaper because it uses

1:56:35.880 --> 1:56:38.520
 snarks or something like that, then you probably could.

1:56:38.520 --> 1:56:44.560
 But maybe now is the time when you actually can do that sort of one way verification.

1:56:44.560 --> 1:56:48.640
 But the one challenge though is that if you want to have a bridge that allows you to move

1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:53.280
 assets between chains, then you don't just need one way verification, you need two way

1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:54.280
 verification.

1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:59.120
 Ethereum can verify anything because Ethereum smart contracts can just run arbitrary code.

1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:04.320
 But if you want Bitcoin to be able to do things based on what happens in Ethereum lands, then

1:57:04.320 --> 1:57:09.400
 Bitcoin would have to basically, well, they can do everything with soft forks because

1:57:09.400 --> 1:57:12.800
 that's their religion, but they'll do it that way.

1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:21.080
 And if Doge wants to make a fork that allows for two way transferability with Ethereum,

1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:22.080
 then they could.

1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:27.240
 I mean, I think that would be a lovely collaboration to make if there is interest.

1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:34.480
 I think there might actually even be some multi sig funds that has some funding.

1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:38.880
 It's just a bounty for someone to make a bridge between the two.

1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:42.800
 Could you maybe try to psychoanalyze Elon Musk for a brief second?

1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:48.880
 So what are your thoughts about Tesla and Elon Musk's journey through the cryptocurrency

1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:50.200
 world?

1:57:50.200 --> 1:57:57.560
 So first with Bitcoin and then with Dogecoin, acquiring and holding a large amount of Bitcoin.

1:57:57.560 --> 1:58:04.160
 And I believe at least considering the acquiring and holding a large amount of Dogecoin.

1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:05.160
 Positive is negatives.

1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:09.600
 What do you think the future for Tesla and SpaceX in the cryptocurrency space looks

1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:10.600
 like?

1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:13.680
 Do you think they'll consider Ethereum?

1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:18.800
 I'm sure that if they stay in the cryptocurrency ecosystem at all, then they have to at some

1:58:18.800 --> 1:58:19.800
 point.

1:58:19.800 --> 1:58:30.680
 Bitcoin number one, Dogecoin number, I mean, come on, it deserves to be number three or

1:58:30.680 --> 1:58:31.680
 number two.

1:58:31.680 --> 1:58:40.200
 And then Ethereum can be whatever that other number is.

1:58:40.200 --> 1:58:45.840
 If Ethereum only becomes a dog coin somehow, maybe change the logo to incorporate a dog

1:58:45.840 --> 1:58:50.040
 or something, so it almost like doors like sneaking behind.

1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:53.240
 Oh, that would be fascinating for the march happen.

1:58:53.240 --> 1:58:59.040
 And I think like Elon, you definitely, I think you would make a mistake if you were to kind

1:58:59.040 --> 1:59:07.240
 of ascribe too much sophisticated malevolent or any deep intentionality to the whole process.

1:59:07.240 --> 1:59:12.280
 I think he's just a human being and he likes dogs, just like I like dogs.

1:59:12.280 --> 1:59:16.360
 I think that is literally the reasoning behind the whole Dogecoin thing.

1:59:16.360 --> 1:59:24.440
 There is some aspect to which, I mean, the guy helped launch a car into space, right?

1:59:24.440 --> 1:59:27.480
 Like you could ask like, what is the purpose of that?

1:59:27.480 --> 1:59:31.240
 I think the purpose of that is fun.

1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:38.480
 I think he truly is more and more especially lately embodying the whole idea that the most

1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:43.120
 entertaining outcome is the most likely and he's fully embracing the most entertaining

1:59:43.120 --> 1:59:48.480
 outcome and in many ways, Dogecoin is the most entertaining cryptocurrency.

1:59:48.480 --> 1:59:52.760
 As cryptocurrency becomes more and more impactful in the world, people are getting more and

1:59:52.760 --> 1:59:54.000
 more serious about it.

1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:59.360
 And so he's selecting the cryptocurrency that is the least serious and the most fun.

1:59:59.360 --> 2:00:06.840
 And there's something to that, like coupling fun with technological sophistication and

2:00:06.840 --> 2:00:09.080
 somehow figuring out a way to do that.

2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:10.080
 Absolutely.

2:00:10.080 --> 2:00:11.080
 To do that well.

2:00:11.080 --> 2:00:12.400
 And I want the world to be fun.

2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:14.960
 I think the world being fun is great.

2:00:14.960 --> 2:00:15.960
 Okay.

2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:19.880
 Let me ask about a couple of other technologies if it's okay.

2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:20.880
 Sure.

2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:25.280
 What are your thoughts about Chainlink and hybrid smart contracts that utilize off chain

2:00:25.280 --> 2:00:28.680
 external data sources?

2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:34.200
 And I think it's definitely necessary for smart contracts so that do a lot of things

2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:37.280
 to use off chain data of some kind.

2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:40.720
 If you want to have a stable coin, you need a price oracle so you know what price you're

2:00:40.720 --> 2:00:41.720
 targeting.

2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:47.880
 If you want to have some fancy crop insurance gadget, I think Aether Risk has been doing

2:00:47.880 --> 2:00:54.120
 a lot of good work with that and I think it was either Kenya or Sri Lanka or both.

2:00:54.120 --> 2:00:59.480
 They're making a lot of good progress in some of those places.

2:00:59.480 --> 2:01:05.320
 Do you need some kind of oracle to tell you, did it actually rain in this particular area?

2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:09.400
 If you want to have assets that mirror other financial assets, you need an oracle.

2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:14.640
 If you want to have a prediction market, you need an oracle and so projects that provide

2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:18.360
 oracles are definitely really important.

2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:22.880
 There are definitely different kinds of use cases like auger is more about events and

2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:26.640
 the auger oracle is designed, I think, differently from Chainlink.

2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:34.000
 Like, emphasize as the whole, we have a fast automated thing that just gives you data quickly.

2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:39.120
 Whereas auger is more, we don't give a crap about speed and look, we don't need to give

2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:42.280
 a crap about speed because if you want to get your money out on a prediction market

2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:48.560
 that where in reality it's resolved, you can probably just sell your coins for $0.99 anyway.

2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:57.960
 So I think Chainlink is definitely taking a good and important part of the oracle design

2:01:57.960 --> 2:01:58.960
 space.

2:01:58.960 --> 2:02:02.920
 I'm definitely happy that there is that project taking the task on.

2:02:02.920 --> 2:02:07.360
 At the same time, I do think that their frog army on Twitter can get a bit intense sometimes.

2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:08.920
 The frog army?

2:02:08.920 --> 2:02:14.440
 Is there a way to incorporate sort of oracle network type of ideas into Ethereum?

2:02:14.440 --> 2:02:19.480
 I personally would prefer the Ethereum base layer.

2:02:19.480 --> 2:02:25.920
 Stay away from trying to provide too much functionality because once you have the Ethereum base layer

2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:33.720
 making a claim about, say, the US dollar to Ethereum price, at some sense, you're basically

2:02:33.720 --> 2:02:40.720
 saying that Ethereum as a base platform starts making what could be geopolitical statements.

2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:46.280
 For example, imagine if there was some civil war and the US split up and you had two currencies

2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:51.240
 that both claims to be the US dollar, well, Ethereum would have to pick one for the sake

2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:53.720
 of everyone who was already using that oracle.

2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:59.000
 Does that mean that the blockchain would be taking a position in this big mega political

2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:00.000
 debate?

2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:08.080
 So I think for just those kinds of reasons, I would personally prefer Ethereum itself

2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:14.640
 to be more of this sort of pure platform that just analyzes transactions and just mathematically

2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:19.240
 using deterministic and census rules, and then if you need the oracles, that can be

2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:20.240
 a layer two.

2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:27.120
 I think Ethereum benefits from not trying to do everything at layer one and having this

2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:30.800
 very robust layer two ecosystem where you have all these projects doing interesting

2:03:30.800 --> 2:03:31.800
 things.

2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:34.920
 Yeah, focus on the basic technology of where the politics got you.

2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:40.680
 Let me ask a bit of a human question.

2:03:40.680 --> 2:03:46.120
 Charles Hoskinson, someone you've worked with in the early days of Ethereum, there

2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:51.160
 appears to my outsider view to have been a bit of a falling out.

2:03:51.160 --> 2:03:59.520
 Is there positive, inspiring human story to be told about why you two parted ways?

2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:06.760
 I kind of want to let the various books about Ethereum speak for themselves, but I feel

2:04:06.760 --> 2:04:17.680
 like since that time, Charles has clearly progressed and matured in a lot of ways.

2:04:17.680 --> 2:04:22.760
 People who follow Charles closely have definitely told me that 2021 Charles is very different

2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:28.440
 from 2014 Charles, and I'm sure 2021 Vitalik is much different from 2014 Vitalik as well.

2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:34.160
 I'm kind of interested how the 2030 and 2040 Vitalik and Charles look like as well.

2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:35.160
 Interesting.

2:04:35.160 --> 2:04:37.440
 Like the progression of the humans.

2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:41.880
 Is this going to be one of those things where everyone comes full circle and then 2030 Vitalik

2:04:41.880 --> 2:04:43.240
 and Charles are best friends?

2:04:43.240 --> 2:04:53.160
 Not necessarily best friends, but some kind of are able to reminisce in ways that puts

2:04:53.160 --> 2:04:55.320
 some of the tension of the past behind.

2:04:55.320 --> 2:05:02.320
 I think such things are possible, and I think people definitely absolutely have a right

2:05:02.320 --> 2:05:08.920
 to and they should strive to just constantly change and reinvent themselves.

2:05:08.920 --> 2:05:13.840
 Is there something you could say about your thoughts about the Cardano project that Charles

2:05:13.840 --> 2:05:17.120
 Hoskinson leads?

2:05:17.120 --> 2:05:22.760
 They worked on some interesting ideas that mirror some of the ideas in Ethereum, proof

2:05:22.760 --> 2:05:29.080
 of stake, working on smart contracts and all those kinds of things.

2:05:29.080 --> 2:05:33.160
 Is there something, again, positive inspiring that you could say?

2:05:33.160 --> 2:05:34.400
 Are they a competitor?

2:05:34.400 --> 2:05:37.960
 Is it complementary technology?

2:05:37.960 --> 2:05:40.040
 There's definitely interesting ideas in there.

2:05:40.040 --> 2:05:44.920
 I do think Cardano takes a bit of a different approach than Ethereum in that they really

2:05:44.920 --> 2:05:50.600
 emphasize having these big academic proofs for everything, whereas Ethereum tends to

2:05:50.600 --> 2:05:56.120
 be more okay with heuristic arguments in part because it's just trying to do more faster,

2:05:56.120 --> 2:06:03.840
 but there's definitely very interesting things that come out of IOHK research.

2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:05.360
 Can you comment on that kind of idea?

2:06:05.360 --> 2:06:11.960
 I, as sort of having a foot in research, enjoy Charles's kind of emphasis on papers

2:06:11.960 --> 2:06:14.760
 and deep academic rigor.

2:06:14.760 --> 2:06:20.880
 Is there, what's the role of deep research rigor in the world of cryptocurrency?

2:06:20.880 --> 2:06:21.880
 Interesting.

2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:25.240
 I'm actually the sort of person who thinks deep rigor is overrated.

2:06:25.240 --> 2:06:32.160
 The reason why I think deep rigor is overrated is because I think in terms of why protocols

2:06:32.160 --> 2:06:38.080
 fail, I think the number of failures that are outside the model is even more important,

2:06:38.080 --> 2:06:42.040
 is bigger and more important than the failures that are inside the model.

2:06:42.040 --> 2:06:47.960
 If you take selfish mining, for example, that original discovery from 2013 that showed

2:06:47.960 --> 2:06:58.040
 how Bitcoin, even if it has a 50% fault tolerance, assuming everyone's honest, it only has a

2:06:58.040 --> 2:07:06.280
 0 to 33% fault tolerance, depending on your network model, if you assume rational actors.

2:07:06.280 --> 2:07:11.800
 To me, that was a great example of an outside the model failure because traditional consensus

2:07:11.800 --> 2:07:19.480
 research just up until before the blockchain days did not think about incentivization much.

2:07:19.480 --> 2:07:21.680
 There was a little bit of thought about incentivization.

2:07:21.680 --> 2:07:26.360
 There's a couple of papers on the Byzantine altruist rational model, but it wasn't that

2:07:26.360 --> 2:07:27.360
 deep.

2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:31.880
 It was mostly operating under the assumption that we're going to make consensus between

2:07:31.880 --> 2:07:34.960
 15 participants and these are institutions.

2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:39.840
 If something goes wrong, then we can figure out whether or not it was deliberate offline

2:07:39.840 --> 2:07:43.480
 and if they did something evil, we can sue them, whereas in the crypto world, you can't

2:07:43.480 --> 2:07:46.140
 do that.

2:07:46.140 --> 2:07:52.360
 That whole discovery basically arose just because the model of traditional consensus

2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:55.720
 research just didn't cover those possibilities.

2:07:55.720 --> 2:08:00.080
 Once you go out of the model, those other issues do exist.

2:08:00.080 --> 2:08:07.480
 But then at the same time, there definitely are protocols that do have failures inside

2:08:07.480 --> 2:08:08.480
 the model.

2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:16.040
 This reminds me of the time when I found a bug in a proposed consensus implementation

2:08:16.040 --> 2:08:18.280
 from either BitShares or EOS.

2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:21.960
 This happened around the end of 2017.

2:08:21.960 --> 2:08:25.680
 That was definitely inside the model because they had a very clear idea of what they were

2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:26.680
 trying to achieve.

2:08:26.680 --> 2:08:30.960
 They had a very clear description and there's a very clear mathematical argument for why

2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:33.480
 the description doesn't lead to what they're trying to achieve.

2:08:33.480 --> 2:08:38.440
 Ultimately, what you're trying to achieve can never be fully described in formal language.

2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:44.280
 Like this is the big discovery of the AI safety people, for example.

2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:50.800
 Just having a specification of what you want is an insanely hard problem.

2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:54.720
 The more powerful the optimizer that you're giving the instructions to, the more you have

2:08:54.720 --> 2:08:58.560
 to be careful.

2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:03.040
 I think there are these two sides.

2:09:03.040 --> 2:09:10.440
 The other thing is that a lot of the academic approach ends up basically optimizing for

2:09:10.440 --> 2:09:16.920
 other people inside of the academic system and it doesn't really optimize for curious

2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:17.920
 outsiders.

2:09:17.920 --> 2:09:21.920
 Whereas I personally, Matt, totally optimize for curious outsiders or at least I feel like

2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:22.920
 I strive to.

2:09:22.920 --> 2:09:32.560
 I guess that's my case for why I tend to behave in ways that occasionally traditional

2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:36.880
 academic types criticize as being reckless.

2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:45.800
 On the other hand, there's definitely real benefits that come from just taking a rigorous

2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:52.480
 approach, especially when you know what the specification is of what you're trying to

2:09:52.480 --> 2:09:58.560
 get and you're trying to improve your way or provide protocols that actually provide

2:09:58.560 --> 2:09:59.560
 that.

2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:00.720
 You know exactly what you're looking for.

2:10:00.720 --> 2:10:06.640
 I feel like realistically, you probably want to do both kinds of analysis and sometimes

2:10:06.640 --> 2:10:09.960
 even want to do both kinds of analysis and stages.

2:10:09.960 --> 2:10:13.440
 You want to do more quick and dirty things and even want public feedback on the quick

2:10:13.440 --> 2:10:18.960
 and dirty stuff and then later on you formalize it more and then you get more feedback.

2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:26.600
 In general, I guess I feel like the norms of research in the future, the internet has

2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:27.680
 just changed so much.

2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:34.320
 There's no way that it's even changed collaboration structures and the patterns in which we work

2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:35.600
 with each other.

2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:40.760
 There's no way that the correct structure for collaborative research is the same as

2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:47.360
 what it was 15 years ago, but what combination of these existing components and of new ideas

2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:52.320
 it is, that's something that's totally legitimate to fight it out.

2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:55.640
 I think it's great that there are different ecosystems that have different attitudes to

2:10:55.640 --> 2:10:56.640
 things.

2:10:56.640 --> 2:11:03.160
 There's a big possibility that ways that the Ethereum ecosystem approaches some problems

2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:04.160
 is totally wrong.

2:11:04.160 --> 2:11:07.920
 If there's other ecosystems with different principles and they do well, that's something

2:11:07.920 --> 2:11:09.800
 that we can learn from.

2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:14.600
 In the spirit of the depth for search, can you comment on AI safety and some people are

2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:18.520
 really worried about the existential risks of artificial intelligence?

2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:25.600
 Is there something you could say that's hopeful about how we avoid in the same kind of line

2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:31.560
 of reasoning about creating form of models versus looking outside the model into what

2:11:31.560 --> 2:11:33.440
 the real world actually is like?

2:11:33.440 --> 2:11:39.760
 Is there some lessons from that we can take and map onto the AI safety world where the

2:11:39.760 --> 2:11:46.080
 potentials of the technology, whether it's in autonomous weapon systems or just the paper

2:11:46.080 --> 2:11:52.120
 clip problem, that we can avoid AI destroying the world?

2:11:52.120 --> 2:11:57.720
 My impression is actually that this is more of a far away impression and it could be wrong,

2:11:57.720 --> 2:12:01.920
 that it might even be that one of the challenges is that AI is not formal enough.

2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:06.040
 Because AI is very practitioner oriented.

2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:10.560
 It's all about, hey, I found a couple of hacks and look, I ran them and look, they seem to

2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:16.800
 improve classification accuracy from 0.684 to 0.773.

2:12:16.800 --> 2:12:21.320
 A lot of the time, there just isn't actual science behind why this hack works and why

2:12:21.320 --> 2:12:23.720
 this other hack doesn't work.

2:12:23.720 --> 2:12:30.240
 You just trial and error your way into it and I could see how that approach works, but

2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:34.840
 at the same time, that approach is not good for eligibility, for example.

2:12:34.840 --> 2:12:40.280
 It's not good for understanding what the heck is actually going on, how these kinds of systems

2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:43.240
 conceivably might fail.

2:12:43.240 --> 2:12:49.440
 There's even a debate on, can you take GPT3 like things and just scale them up and their

2:12:49.440 --> 2:12:53.800
 intelligence will continue to improve or is there just some types of reasoning that they're

2:12:53.800 --> 2:12:58.600
 fundamentally bad at and they're not going to get good at it no matter how much you scale

2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:05.200
 this exact same approach and add more hardware to it.

2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:09.920
 Thinking about what's going on more explicitly, my understanding is that a big part of AI

2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:14.240
 safety research is trying to do that sort of stuff.

2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:15.240
 Formalize.

2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:22.040
 Formalize, try to improve just AI eligibility, trying to understand if the AI makes some

2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:28.040
 classification so we can actually see what happens and what's going on in the middle.

2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:34.720
 Whereas with traditional cryptography, it's very much not... Well, okay, I should quite

2:13:34.720 --> 2:13:35.720
 say that.

2:13:35.720 --> 2:13:40.120
 Trucial cryptography is this interesting mix of being very formal and being very informal

2:13:40.120 --> 2:13:45.600
 because it's very formal with, given these security assumptions, prove that the protocol

2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:47.480
 works under these security assumptions.

2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:51.160
 The places where it's very informal is like, well, how do we even know that there isn't

2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:53.960
 any efficient algorithm for factoring numbers?

2:13:53.960 --> 2:13:58.600
 We kind of tried it for 40 years and then so far no one's found anything better than

2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:03.560
 the general number field sieve and like, okay, fine, we'll just assume it's fine.

2:14:03.560 --> 2:14:08.600
 How do we know you can't find the discrete log between two elliptic curve points like

2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:14.440
... Did it a couple of decades and no one's found anything faster than baby step, giant

2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:22.040
 step stuff.

2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:27.240
 There's definitely ways in which that approach really makes sense because at least you can

2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:32.520
 concentrate your analysis on a small number of building blocks and you do have some intuitive

2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:35.960
 reasoning about those building blocks, but at least there is a small number of building

2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:39.600
 blocks and lots of people are looking at them and then everything else just sort of gets

2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:43.920
 formally built on top and you actually can mathematically reduce the security of big

2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:45.840
 things to building blocks.

2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:52.360
 You can have mathematical proofs that say, if you make a ZK Sennarch of a yes statement

2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:59.400
 when in reality that statement is false, then you can use that to extract information out

2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:02.920
 of elliptic curves that completely breaks the problem or something like that.

2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:08.080
 So ZK is not an example where formalism is beneficial.

2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:09.080
 Absolutely.

2:15:09.080 --> 2:15:10.080
 Yeah.

2:15:10.080 --> 2:15:14.560
 And so maybe you can have the same kind of stuff in AI safety within AI systems that

2:15:14.560 --> 2:15:21.400
 you can get a hold of some kind of aspect of the systems that you can control provably.

2:15:21.400 --> 2:15:27.240
 And then in blockchains and cryptocurrency, I think the one area where consensus mechanisms

2:15:27.240 --> 2:15:32.080
 is still more an art than a science is that these aren't just technological systems, they're

2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:35.520
 crypto economic systems and they make assumptions about people.

2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:38.800
 And which assumptions you can make about people is not something that you can prove

2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:40.800
 with math.

2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:45.320
 Even just the basic 51%, people are honest.

2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:47.440
 Can you trust the 51%?

2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:53.880
 If you can't trust the 51%, can you trust the other 49% to be able to coordinate on

2:15:53.880 --> 2:15:55.240
 making their own fork?

2:15:55.240 --> 2:15:56.800
 What will happen to coin prices?

2:15:56.800 --> 2:16:00.560
 How do people as human beings react to these events?

2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:02.520
 There's all of these assumptions.

2:16:02.520 --> 2:16:07.600
 But at the same time, if you can write down the assumptions, then you can do formal things

2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:08.600
 with them.

2:16:08.600 --> 2:16:13.720
 I almost forgot to ask you about one of the most exciting aspects of Ethereum.

2:16:13.720 --> 2:16:14.720
 It's non technical.

2:16:14.720 --> 2:16:20.120
 I think it's a societal, it's social, which is NFTs.

2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:27.800
 So what do you think about the explosion of NFTs in the recent months, especially in the

2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:31.720
 art world and beyond, and what does the future look like?

2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:39.960
 So this is maybe the social impact on the world, on the individual creators of all kinds.

2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:45.040
 Is that something you've actually expected to see NFTs having this kind of impact?

2:16:45.040 --> 2:16:52.680
 And beyond what do you think will happen in the digital space with NFTs in virtual reality

2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:55.520
 and gaming, all those kinds of things?

2:16:55.520 --> 2:16:59.240
 I was definitely surprised by NFTs in particular.

2:16:59.240 --> 2:17:03.840
 I even actually, I think, might be on record somewhere on some tech conference panel.

2:17:03.840 --> 2:17:08.440
 They were asking, it was one of those overrated or underrated sections and I asked about NFTs

2:17:08.440 --> 2:17:11.960
 and I thought, and I said, hey, I think NFTs are overrated.

2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:14.560
 And in retrospect, that turned out to be quite wrong.

2:17:14.560 --> 2:17:21.040
 I think I guess I just personally can't really relate to this concept of spending a lot of

2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:31.440
 money on a thing and there's no clear understanding of why that thing would maintain its value.

2:17:31.440 --> 2:17:32.440
 Right.

2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:34.680
 Uniqueness of a thing having value.

2:17:34.680 --> 2:17:35.680
 Right.

2:17:35.680 --> 2:17:36.680
 Exactly.

2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:43.800
 I definitely cannot really understand the psychology behind paying $200,000 for original

2:17:43.800 --> 2:17:44.800
 art painting.

2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:48.640
 I'd be like, if I had a mansion, just give me photocopies of everything.

2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:52.320
 You can hang three photocopies of the Mona Lisa.

2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:53.320
 Why would you even have the Mona Lisa?

2:17:53.320 --> 2:17:56.360
 I think I'd probably just have some Nyan cats or something.

2:17:56.360 --> 2:18:00.240
 That's one thing where mathematics or theoretical computer science cannot formalize why the

2:18:00.240 --> 2:18:02.480
 heck NFTs are valuable at all.

2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:09.880
 But the thing that makes me very happy about the space now that it has happened is that

2:18:09.880 --> 2:18:12.960
 this gets back to the conversation that we had at the beginning.

2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:17.560
 I'm interested in this concept of decentralized public goods funding.

2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:22.720
 I want things that are good and valuable to as much as possible.

2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:27.280
 Also be things that can economically sustain the people who produce them.

2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:31.320
 Because if you don't have that, then either the public goods just don't get produced at

2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:36.840
 all or people make centralized versions that have some of the properties and try to be

2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:41.880
 substitutes, but actually just concentrate control on a very small group.

2:18:41.880 --> 2:18:44.640
 Both of those things are not very nice.

2:18:44.640 --> 2:18:48.880
 The nice thing about NFTs would be, well, if you're an artist and you can just mint

2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:52.600
 NFTs and this is a source of revenue, it's like, great, that's another stream of revenue

2:18:52.600 --> 2:18:57.240
 for creative work that often does still get underfunded.

2:18:57.240 --> 2:18:58.240
 That's amazing.

2:18:58.240 --> 2:18:59.240
 Okay.

2:18:59.240 --> 2:19:00.240
 Let me ask you a weird question.

2:19:00.240 --> 2:19:06.360
 We talked about Craig Wright a little bit, but a lot of people write to me, one of two

2:19:06.360 --> 2:19:08.160
 emails.

2:19:08.160 --> 2:19:16.960
 One email is calling any coin outside of Bitcoin a scam.

2:19:16.960 --> 2:19:22.840
 Then the other email is saying, my favorite coin is the best coin.

2:19:22.840 --> 2:19:27.600
 It's going to save the world, whatever that coin is.

2:19:27.600 --> 2:19:31.440
 I sit back and I look, I have no idea.

2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:36.560
 I try to figure out the humans that I trust in this space.

2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:43.240
 But basic human qualities, but do you think some coins are scams?

2:19:43.240 --> 2:19:48.840
 Do you think some coins, maybe another way to ask it are scammier than other coins?

2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:53.560
 How are people that are looking outside of the space where there's all of these cryptocurrencies

2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:59.440
 supposed to figure out what is a scam and not, or how to use the right kind of language

2:19:59.440 --> 2:20:03.840
 when talking about them, because there's the harshness of the language from the Bitcoin

2:20:03.840 --> 2:20:09.640
 maximus that doesn't just say everything's a scam, including Ethereum.

2:20:09.640 --> 2:20:13.880
 But they use terms like shit coin that says it's not only a scam, it's like a waste of

2:20:13.880 --> 2:20:14.880
 time.

2:20:14.880 --> 2:20:19.280
 I mean, every word you can use, they say that that's very harsh and then some people are

2:20:19.280 --> 2:20:26.200
 just apply the word scam a little bit, much, much more conservatively and just refer to

2:20:26.200 --> 2:20:31.560
 coins that are legitimately are trying to scam people out of their money as scams.

2:20:31.560 --> 2:20:35.720
 So what do we do with this word scam, should it ever be applied to coins?

2:20:35.720 --> 2:20:41.040
 And is it a binary thing or is it a gray area?

2:20:41.040 --> 2:20:43.000
 I think it's definitely a gray area.

2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:46.320
 There's definitely things that are really in actual scams.

2:20:46.320 --> 2:20:51.120
 I mean, BitConnect would be one example of something that's a way on the scam spectrum.

2:20:51.120 --> 2:20:54.800
 Did you see their 2017 promotional video, by the way?

2:20:54.800 --> 2:20:55.800
 BitConnect?

2:20:55.800 --> 2:20:56.800
 Yeah.

2:20:56.800 --> 2:20:57.800
 Hey, hey, hey.

2:20:57.800 --> 2:20:58.800
 What's up?

2:20:58.800 --> 2:20:59.800
 What's up?

2:20:59.800 --> 2:21:00.800
 BitConnect.

2:21:00.800 --> 2:21:06.680
 It was this three minute, 48 second video that was just of this guy making this totally

2:21:06.680 --> 2:21:12.000
 crazy rant and it was at some conference in Vietnam where they were, of course, trying

2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:15.520
 to convince a whole bunch of people to buy this coin and they had these claims about

2:21:15.520 --> 2:21:17.760
 how it would go up in value.

2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:26.720
 That was definitely the peak of these pure, completely scammy coins and that was definitely

2:21:26.720 --> 2:21:27.720
 really terrible.

2:21:27.720 --> 2:21:33.600
 I feel like despite cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger, we actually have quite a bit

2:21:33.600 --> 2:21:34.920
 less of that now.

2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:40.600
 But then, of course, there's this spectrum of things that are not completely scams and

2:21:40.600 --> 2:21:46.080
 then things that are not scams and that are technically totally fine projects but where

2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:51.400
 their community is just incredibly sketchy and then all the way to things that are where

2:21:51.400 --> 2:21:55.760
 the community is nice but maybe the project is just fundamentally incapable of achieving

2:21:55.760 --> 2:22:02.000
 what it's trying to do or the community doesn't realize and then really good projects.

2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:10.120
 If you want to go a step, if that's 100% scam, then what would I call, say, 80% scam?

2:22:10.120 --> 2:22:11.280
 Bitcoin SV is one example.

2:22:11.280 --> 2:22:13.320
 This is Craig Wright's work of Bitcoin.

2:22:13.320 --> 2:22:15.760
 Theoretically, it's a blockchain.

2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:17.080
 It's a fork of Bitcoin.

2:22:17.080 --> 2:22:20.280
 It has 512 megabyte blocks.

2:22:20.280 --> 2:22:23.400
 If you really wanted to, you could use the blockchain.

2:22:23.400 --> 2:22:27.280
 What satisfies the property is that you can send transactions onto it.

2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:33.200
 You can probably use it as a backup to store your files if you really wanted to just because

2:22:33.200 --> 2:22:35.840
 it has so much space.

2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:46.240
 It might fail but at the same time, as we basically said, Craig Wright is a scammer

2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:49.760
 and half the community is just totally batched insane.

2:22:49.760 --> 2:22:55.640
 The humans of a particular cryptocurrency is what makes for a scam and not the humans

2:22:55.640 --> 2:23:00.400
 at the top that have a voice guiding the community.

2:23:00.400 --> 2:23:06.960
 In the case of BSV, the humans, they make just completely wrong and just obviously wrong

2:23:06.960 --> 2:23:13.160
 claims about what BSV is capable of accomplishing and what it can still be code accomplished.

2:23:13.160 --> 2:23:17.560
 There's just a lot of aspects of it that make it feel like a money grab.

2:23:17.560 --> 2:23:22.360
 That's one example and then you've got to go a bit further and then you have the trons

2:23:22.360 --> 2:23:24.240
 of the world.

2:23:24.240 --> 2:23:25.640
 That's a platform.

2:23:25.640 --> 2:23:26.640
 You can use it.

2:23:26.640 --> 2:23:28.200
 You can do stuff on it.

2:23:28.200 --> 2:23:34.640
 But at the same time, they did plagiarize the IPFS white paper and then they kept…

2:23:34.640 --> 2:23:39.680
 So the scammy qualities, see the thing that throws me off a lot, it's very difficult

2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:48.200
 for me is that most coins, but the ones that make me feel like are scammy, have a large

2:23:48.200 --> 2:23:56.440
 community of people that are super positive about it and they'll write to me.

2:23:56.440 --> 2:24:04.320
 Now that said, on the flip side of that, Bitcoin people are also very positive.

2:24:04.320 --> 2:24:11.440
 There's some sense and the reason I was having squinty eyes looking at Bitcoin for quite

2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:14.720
 a while is why is everyone so positive?

2:24:14.720 --> 2:24:18.960
 I was getting total cult vibes.

2:24:18.960 --> 2:24:27.640
 The ideas are not grounded in truth but are grounded in an obsession of when you can artificially

2:24:27.640 --> 2:24:31.640
 conjure up a truth, which is why I was a little bit worried about Bitcoin.

2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:38.480
 I think I've learned a lot since then to where I learned to separate the community

2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:45.440
 from the ideas and I think Bitcoin is a revolutionary idea on many fronts, but still a community

2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:51.440
 that's dogmatically excited about something, whatever that is, makes me skeptical.

2:24:51.440 --> 2:24:59.320
 Maybe it's just my upbringing, but when everybody's really excited about something, it makes

2:24:59.320 --> 2:25:04.960
 me skeptical, but it also makes me difficult to decide what is this scam or not because

2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:08.880
 some of the most exciting ideas in this world have a community of people who are excited

2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:12.280
 about it because I don't know.

2:25:12.280 --> 2:25:19.160
 I think space exploration is super exciting and I know a lot of them that are exceptionally

2:25:19.160 --> 2:25:23.480
 excited about space exploration, does that mean it's a scam?

2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:24.480
 No.

2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:29.560
 I don't know what to do with that and so most of us just try to stay away, I suppose, but

2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:33.920
 it's unfortunate because I'm sure there's a lot of exciting technologies in that space.

2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:41.040
 In the case of Bitcoin, I would definitely not call Bitcoin a scam.

2:25:41.040 --> 2:25:43.520
 I would also not call Litecoin a scam.

2:25:43.520 --> 2:25:48.640
 There's people who call Litecoin a scam because they just say, oh look, it has no fundamental

2:25:48.640 --> 2:25:55.840
 use case and the concept of being silver to Bitcoin's gold is just stupid and Millie

2:25:55.840 --> 2:26:02.960
 Bitcoin is the silver to Bitcoin's gold, but at the same time, if you have these people

2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:09.560
 who just, they do seem to honestly believe this and they're trying to just make Litecoin

2:26:09.560 --> 2:26:18.120
 be a Litecoin as best as they can, then to me, that's enough for it to not be a scam.

2:26:18.120 --> 2:26:28.440
 Then I think the biggest gray area is definitely between projects that are earnest, but they

2:26:28.440 --> 2:26:34.960
 have just all sorts of these different combinations of flawed qualities to them.

2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:39.200
 The ones that legitimately use the scam is when the key people that are at the head of

2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:46.640
 the project are intentionally lying and I think as long as the intent is to try to do

2:26:46.640 --> 2:26:53.160
 good in the world, even if your actual implementation of that is flawed, I think that's not a scam.

2:26:53.160 --> 2:26:58.000
 It could be flawed ideas, it could be wrong ideas, but it's not a scam.

2:26:58.000 --> 2:26:59.800
 I'm learning to navigate this space.

2:26:59.800 --> 2:27:07.320
 Yeah, it's definitely a very challenging space to navigate.

2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:10.240
 In some ways, the reflection of the world at large.

2:27:10.240 --> 2:27:11.240
 Yeah.

2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:15.800
 And as we've said, maybe offline, that the fact that money has evolved makes it a little

2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:25.320
 bit more complicated, that lives can be ruined by the choice of technologies that are taken

2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:26.320
 on.

2:27:26.320 --> 2:27:32.440
 So, it makes it more real, more painful, more elevated the impact of this.

2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:35.280
 Imagine Mac versus PC wars.

2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:39.520
 If everyone who bought a MacBook had had 10 Apple shares inside of it and everyone who

2:27:39.520 --> 2:27:45.280
 had a PC had 10 Microsoft shares inside of it, and then you had the elites who bought

2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:51.400
 their Macs back in 1983, they spent $500 dead and now they have $40 billion, so they just

2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:56.080
 think that they're these gurus who understands the future of finance and geopolitics and

2:27:56.080 --> 2:28:00.520
 they make theories about why Apple is the one that's going to bring freedom to the world

2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:05.280
 and Windows is secretly aligned with the axis of evil.

2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:06.280
 Oh, that's brilliant.

2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:07.720
 So, yeah, this is so brilliant.

2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:12.480
 So, I think the right way to think about this is we map some of the cryptocurrency battles

2:28:12.480 --> 2:28:19.200
 into the space of like Emacs versus Vim or Apple versus PC, if there were some stock

2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:25.680
 that came along with each implementation of each PC, each Mac, that's fascinating.

2:28:25.680 --> 2:28:31.440
 This is 100% correct, 100% correct, because then that really energizes the armies of people

2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:35.320
 debating over this in a way that something without money does not.

2:28:35.320 --> 2:28:40.320
 Okay, let me ask you about something really fascinating that you are also excited about,

2:28:40.320 --> 2:28:44.320
 which is longevity, anti aging.

2:28:44.320 --> 2:28:50.720
 You have donated money to the SENS Foundation, so you have an interest in this whole space

2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:53.440
 of lifespan research.

2:28:53.440 --> 2:28:54.960
 What's your vision here?

2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:59.880
 What do you hope to see in anti aging and longevity research?

2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:07.080
 I think I hope to see the concept of seeing your parents and grandparents die, just slowly

2:29:07.080 --> 2:29:11.280
 disappear from the public consciousness as an experience that happens over the course

2:29:11.280 --> 2:29:16.160
 of half a century, the same way that getting lost in a city slowly disappeared over the

2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:20.040
 public consciousness over the last 15 years that we have smartphones.

2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:27.640
 The thing you have from Nick Bostrom, the essay pinned in your Twitter, argues that

2:29:27.640 --> 2:29:33.200
 essentially that death is almost unethical.

2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:39.080
 The fact that we don't do something about this thing that in the essay is a dragon that

2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:47.200
 keeps murdering everybody around us, including our parents and grandparents, is the fact

2:29:47.200 --> 2:29:55.880
 that we don't try to do something aggressively about that dragon doesn't make any sense.

2:29:55.880 --> 2:30:01.800
 Do you think this is a battle worth fighting, a battle for immortality, or at least longevity?

2:30:01.800 --> 2:30:08.320
 I'd say absolutely, and I'd say it's a battle where we really have started over the last

2:30:08.320 --> 2:30:15.360
 five years in particular to see the first cracks of humanity starting to make things

2:30:15.360 --> 2:30:20.000
 that look like they'll turn into victories.

2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:23.400
 Do you think humans can eventually live forever?

2:30:23.400 --> 2:30:28.640
 Maybe as a side comment to that, what technology do you think will enable that as a genetic

2:30:28.640 --> 2:30:32.720
 modification, is it cloning, is it uploading your mind?

2:30:32.720 --> 2:30:33.720
 Define forever.

2:30:33.720 --> 2:30:39.040
 Are we talking 1,000 years, a million, 10 to the 14, 10 to the 45?

2:30:39.040 --> 2:30:43.080
 Let's start as I tweeted today, eventually everything, the universe will be filled with

2:30:43.080 --> 2:30:45.560
 supermassive black holes.

2:30:45.560 --> 2:30:49.880
 That forever, maybe backtracking to where?

2:30:49.880 --> 2:30:55.720
 We'll have 10 to the 16 years to figure it out.

2:30:55.720 --> 2:31:03.440
 Maybe travel between the multiverse, between the different universes, the multiverse.

2:31:03.440 --> 2:31:11.600
 But forever meaning millennia.

2:31:11.600 --> 2:31:13.920
 I definitely think that we can get there.

2:31:13.920 --> 2:31:18.480
 I definitely think that it's the sort of thing that's going to take an insanely huge amount

2:31:18.480 --> 2:31:23.360
 of work, and I definitely think it's the sort of thing where once we figure out the first

2:31:23.360 --> 2:31:28.760
 crop of problems, and people start living to 150, we'll just realize that there's like

2:31:28.760 --> 2:31:32.600
 10 other problems that kill you half a slowly, and we'll have to do more work.

2:31:32.600 --> 2:31:38.080
 The good news is that this is Aubrey's longevity escape velocity argument, that if you get

2:31:38.080 --> 2:31:42.640
 everyone to live to 150 now, then you have half a century to fix all those other problems

2:31:42.640 --> 2:31:45.280
 as well.

2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:49.280
 I'm optimistic for that reason, I think.

2:31:49.280 --> 2:31:53.760
 You definitely do not want to underestimate human ingenuity, especially over the long

2:31:53.760 --> 2:31:54.760
 term.

2:31:54.760 --> 2:31:58.760
 Just to look at what happens to computers between the NEAC in 1950 and where we're

2:31:58.760 --> 2:31:59.760
 in 2020.

2:31:59.760 --> 2:32:03.520
 That's a span of 70 years.

2:32:03.520 --> 2:32:10.920
 Both of us, I think, with just present day technology, have at least 70 more years to

2:32:10.920 --> 2:32:11.920
 live.

2:32:11.920 --> 2:32:16.280
 Just imagine what kind of sea change will happen in biomedicine during that time.

2:32:16.280 --> 2:32:21.840
 The other thing that made me optimistic is that I actually think COVID has been this

2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:29.720
 event that's really pushed biomedicine, and especially activist approaches to biomedicine

2:32:29.720 --> 2:32:33.800
 really into the public consciousness.

2:32:33.800 --> 2:32:40.640
 It's put people into this mindset that it's not just the bits and tweets that are going

2:32:40.640 --> 2:32:48.920
 to save the world, but the bio is actually super important and huge.

2:32:48.920 --> 2:32:54.240
 Ultimately what's ending COVID, basically, is the vaccines, and the vaccines have just

2:32:54.240 --> 2:32:58.400
 been amazing.

2:32:58.400 --> 2:33:06.520
 You can take that energy and also this, I think, philosophical attitude that I've noticed.

2:33:06.520 --> 2:33:11.800
 The way that I would describe the philosophical attitude here, this is going more depth first,

2:33:11.800 --> 2:33:19.480
 is that I think the way that I interpret part of what I would call late 20th century ideology

2:33:19.480 --> 2:33:25.520
 is that there is this mentality that nature is good and disruptions from nature are bad

2:33:25.520 --> 2:33:29.000
 and generally want to minimize disruptions from nature.

2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:31.320
 This exists everywhere in the political spectrum.

2:33:31.320 --> 2:33:33.600
 There's nature as in literal nature.

2:33:33.600 --> 2:33:40.680
 My view is that the right wing version of that is markets as nature.

2:33:40.680 --> 2:33:47.760
 The way that that kind of philosophy talks about markets and the goal of not interfering

2:33:47.760 --> 2:33:51.720
 with them, it is very nature styled.

2:33:51.720 --> 2:33:57.240
 Then, of course, the conservative one, which is traditional culture that existed before

2:33:57.240 --> 2:34:02.080
 the activists started controlling everything as also being a kind of nature.

2:34:02.080 --> 2:34:09.880
 But the 21st century attitude and really COVID has flipped a lot of minds because with COVID,

2:34:09.880 --> 2:34:13.720
 what's happened is that, well, no, nature is not safe.

2:34:13.720 --> 2:34:19.680
 The default is untold misery and suffering in tens of millions of people dying.

2:34:19.680 --> 2:34:27.000
 The only way out for us is through human ingenuity.

2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:35.520
 That frame of mind is one that's much more friendly to this other change of minds that

2:34:35.520 --> 2:34:40.160
 I want to see, which is basically treating aging as an engineering problem.

2:34:40.160 --> 2:34:44.440
 The default is all 7.8 billion human beings that are currently on this earth are going

2:34:44.440 --> 2:34:49.560
 to die and they're going to live their last decade of life in debilitating pain.

2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:52.880
 The only way to stop that is human ingenuity.

2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:56.920
 We don't have that solution yet, but if we work hard, we will.

2:34:56.920 --> 2:35:00.640
 More and more people on the biology side, computational biologic, are basically converting

2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:05.600
 the mess of the human biology into an engineering problem.

2:35:05.600 --> 2:35:10.000
 Once that conversion is happening, looking at the genetic code, the proteins, all those

2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:15.360
 kinds of things, once that conversion happens, you can now apply the tools that we know how

2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:18.440
 to solve engineering problems to solving it that way.

2:35:18.440 --> 2:35:24.480
 Then there's also the other version, which is why do we romanticize this meat vehicle

2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:29.960
 that ultimately is just a thing that carries the brain, maybe we can more and more convert

2:35:29.960 --> 2:35:31.960
 ourselves into the digital realm.

2:35:31.960 --> 2:35:37.120
 This is where Neuralink have the brain computer interfaces and then achieve immortality in

2:35:37.120 --> 2:35:41.040
 the space of information in the digital space versus in the biology space.

2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:44.880
 That stuff's interesting too, I agree.

2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:48.360
 We have enough resources and we should just try all the parallel tracks.

2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:51.520
 It's great that we have people just trying to make our bodies work.

2:35:51.520 --> 2:35:56.640
 It's great that we have people trying to improve brain scanning.

2:35:56.640 --> 2:36:02.000
 It's also great that we have people improving cryonics, we could just go to sleep in the

2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:07.600
 freezer and eventually, hopefully sometime in the future, Helfinny's going to be able

2:36:07.600 --> 2:36:11.400
 to wake up all of this.

2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:17.360
 Anyone who gets cryocronically frozen today will be able to wake up, but that's a bet.

2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:19.200
 That's the last resort.

2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:26.640
 The other interesting thing about the extreme uploading approach is we're excited about

2:36:26.640 --> 2:36:28.200
 space.

2:36:28.200 --> 2:36:35.160
 One of the points that a lot of hard science fiction types make is that if you want to

2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:38.680
 explore space, that's a lot easier if you're not a human.

2:36:38.680 --> 2:36:43.120
 One example of this is that in the context of humans, we're talking about, oh, we're

2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:47.080
 going to be able to go to the moon, oh, we're going to be able to go to Mars, but there's

2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:49.640
 this project called Starshot, I believe.

2:36:49.640 --> 2:36:55.400
 That's basically trying to send spacecrafts to mini spacecrafts to Alpha Centauri, and

2:36:55.400 --> 2:36:59.480
 they literally believe that they're going to be able to get spacecraft over to Alpha

2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:04.000
 Centauri four light years away by the 2060s.

2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:07.280
 By traveling close to the speed of light.

2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:09.400
 The way it works is you have these light sails.

2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:12.840
 You basically take these as a spacecraft and you shine a laser at it, and the laser is

2:37:12.840 --> 2:37:19.280
 insanely strong, quickly accelerated at 100 Gs, no, I think it was 10,000 Gs until it

2:37:19.280 --> 2:37:23.840
 gets to 20% the speed of light, and then it goes on your merry way.

2:37:23.840 --> 2:37:31.680
 If you want to be in, like personally explore the Alpha Centauri system within two centuries

2:37:31.680 --> 2:37:39.560
 or one century, then being a robot is by far the most practical way to do it because there's

2:37:39.560 --> 2:37:42.720
 no way that a human being can survive 10,000 Gs.

2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:48.320
 It's definitely interesting long term, but at the same time, there's definitely a lot

2:37:48.320 --> 2:37:53.840
 of psychological hangups and a lot of deep philosophy that we'll just have to grapple

2:37:53.840 --> 2:37:55.560
 with to get there.

2:37:55.560 --> 2:38:00.880
 I think it hangs on the topic of whether we can convert consciousness into an engineering

2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:01.880
 problem.

2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:02.880
 Exactly.

2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:05.360
 Is consciousness tied to our biology?

2:38:05.360 --> 2:38:10.880
 Because the moment we can convert consciousness into a digital form, then we can send it with

2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:13.040
 that light sail to Alpha Centauri.

2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:18.600
 Until then, a robot is not carrying anything except maybe some basic knowledge like Wikipedia.

2:38:18.600 --> 2:38:21.480
 It's not carrying the flame of human consciousness.

2:38:21.480 --> 2:38:26.800
 I have high hopes for converting consciousness into an engineering problem.

2:38:26.800 --> 2:38:30.800
 In fact, I think it's not as difficult as people think.

2:38:30.800 --> 2:38:31.800
 I agree with that.

2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:36.520
 I'm definitely in the camp that consciousness is a property of the algorithm and not a property

2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:39.880
 of brain structure.

2:38:39.880 --> 2:38:45.120
 The philosophical things we'd have to grapple with is once you upload yourself, you can

2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:51.640
 hit Control C. It wouldn't be lovely to have 10 copies of a experiment, and then we could

2:38:51.640 --> 2:38:54.720
 just interview everyone.

2:38:54.720 --> 2:38:56.200
 I have to ask this question.

2:38:56.200 --> 2:39:03.280
 It's a difficult one, which I don't think it'd be wonderful, first of all.

2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:07.120
 In the following way, and this has to do with immortality as well, there's something about

2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:14.680
 scarcity that creates value, or there's a bunch of philosophers, Victor Franco, Bernard

2:39:14.680 --> 2:39:21.520
 Williams, Ernest Becker, they argue that death or the scarcity of life creates meaning.

2:39:21.520 --> 2:39:30.560
 The reason life is beautiful, the reason so many moments of experience of love or delicious

2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:36.880
 food, all those things are made delicious because they're finite, because they end and

2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:42.360
 because we don't have that many of them, and there's a kind of worry that if we extend

2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:51.440
 the human lifespan, if we achieve immortality, or if we, God forbid, clone me multiple times,

2:39:51.440 --> 2:39:57.040
 then you lose the richness of what it means to have this life, to have this experience.

2:39:57.040 --> 2:39:58.440
 Is that worry you at all?

2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:02.720
 Do you think there's some aspect to which death does, in fact, give meaning to life?

2:40:02.720 --> 2:40:08.080
 I guess the one historical parallel, and this might be a bit unfair, is that there have

2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:15.000
 been philosophers that have said things like war gives meaning to human collectives and

2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:22.440
 the struggle for supremacy between nations and races as this big driver of progress that

2:40:22.440 --> 2:40:26.320
 ensures that everyone strives to be their best.

2:40:26.320 --> 2:40:30.800
 Of course, this viewpoint got into the head of a crazy Austrian guy, and 20 years later

2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:34.400
 his soldiers were shooting at my grandparents.

2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:39.520
 These days, we don't really have that, but yet life still feels meaningful.

2:40:39.520 --> 2:40:47.360
 We've still found other ways to, they're still us driving for technological progress.

2:40:47.360 --> 2:40:54.560
 There's still us driving for self improvements in general, and it turns out that you don't

2:40:54.560 --> 2:40:59.080
 actually need to have existential conflicts in order to have that.

2:40:59.080 --> 2:41:01.440
 Maybe you need conflict, but we have other kinds of conflicts.

2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:05.920
 We have competition between businesses, competition between political ideologies, competition

2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:14.000
 between projects, and so whatever the psychological needs are, they're just our substitutes for

2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:15.000
 it.

2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:27.120
 I feel like once we start living to the age of 200, then I'm just intuitively expecting

2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:31.560
 that we'll see substitutes emerge in the same way.

2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:38.440
 Yeah, we'll create conflicts of other sorts that lead to less human suffering than wars

2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:39.440
 do.

2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:45.360
 We'll just start playing Diablo 4, 5, 6, because you die in video games, so maybe we'll get

2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:50.920
 some of the inkling of scarcity through the activities we partake in as opposed to our

2:41:50.920 --> 2:41:52.560
 own body dying.

2:41:52.560 --> 2:42:00.720
 I feel shitty when I, I remember in Diablo 3, you can play in hardcore mode, where if

2:42:00.720 --> 2:42:03.360
 you die in the game, your character's dead.

2:42:03.360 --> 2:42:11.840
 Maybe we'll get the richness that we currently get from life by having little artificial versions

2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:13.240
 of ourselves that die.

2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:17.480
 Interesting enough, as I've just personally spent more time in this world, I've started

2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:24.160
 realizing that there is a concept of real finiteness that still exists, and it might

2:42:24.160 --> 2:42:28.400
 even still be a thing that provides meaning that doesn't require anyone to actually die.

2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:35.400
 For example, how many people from middle school or even high school, yours, do you still talk

2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:36.400
 to regularly?

2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:40.160
 I happen to be close friends with four or five of them.

2:42:40.160 --> 2:42:43.480
 In my case, the answer is zero for middle school and two for high school.

2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:44.480
 But you're right.

2:42:44.480 --> 2:42:45.800
 It dropped close to zero.

2:42:45.800 --> 2:42:46.800
 Exactly.

2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:47.800
 You're right.

2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:52.560
 There's a lot of these relationships that end up being very finite.

2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:58.000
 A person changes their, I feel like a person changes enough of their worldview after 25

2:42:58.000 --> 2:42:59.000
 years.

2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:00.000
 Was it there even a study about this?

2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:06.560
 Something like a person and themselves 25 years later about as different as two different

2:43:06.560 --> 2:43:09.600
 people or something like this?

2:43:09.600 --> 2:43:15.760
 Just like you can have conflict without bloodshed, I think you can have finiteness and even the

2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:21.800
 necessary sorrows of finiteness that give meaning without literally anyone having to

2:43:21.800 --> 2:43:22.800
 end their life.

2:43:22.800 --> 2:43:27.840
 Hopefully, if we do extend our life, we'll figure out ways to extend the period of time

2:43:27.840 --> 2:43:34.240
 where there's neuroplasticity to where we could change our worldviews continually throughout

2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:38.800
 that time so you can have these different phases of life.

2:43:38.800 --> 2:43:41.560
 I thought it would be fun to hear you speak a little Russian.

2:43:41.560 --> 2:43:46.560
 Do you speak Russian?

2:43:46.560 --> 2:43:47.560
 Yes, of course.

2:43:47.560 --> 2:43:50.560
 How did your Russian roots help you?

2:43:50.560 --> 2:43:51.560
 It's an interesting question.

2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:52.560
 What can you say about this?

2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:56.560
 What can you say about my Russian roots?

2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:11.560
 When I look at other projects, other people in the blockchain industry, when I look at

2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:19.560
 what Russian people are doing, what other people are doing, I can sometimes feel that these

2:44:19.560 --> 2:44:31.560
 people in Russian have something that feels similar to me, but I don't know how to explain

2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:32.560
 it.

2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:40.160
 Do you think for people who don't speak Russian that Vitalik said that there is something

2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:45.200
 to the spirit of the people that are Russian, that are working in the cryptocurrency world,

2:44:45.200 --> 2:44:51.600
 that's a little bit different and it's something that connects to some kind of aspect of your

2:44:51.600 --> 2:44:55.760
 own self, some kind of roots there.

2:44:55.760 --> 2:44:56.760
 It's kind of interesting.

2:44:56.760 --> 2:45:01.640
 Do you think that there's, does it make you sad that there's these two different worlds

2:45:01.640 --> 2:45:09.280
 that are sort of in part disconnected by language, and I'm sure the same could be the case with

2:45:09.280 --> 2:45:17.040
 China and other parts of the world where the language slows the transmission of the beauty

2:45:17.040 --> 2:45:21.640
 of the culture in a certain kind of way where you can't truly collaborate.

2:45:21.640 --> 2:45:26.200
 You can all speak English, you're collaborating on maybe a technical level, but you're not

2:45:26.200 --> 2:45:30.760
 collaborating on the level of some deep human connection.

2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:34.360
 Do you see that being able to speak both languages?

2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:39.760
 There's definitely benefits, I think, to be able to speak multiple languages.

2:45:39.760 --> 2:45:46.760
 Once you can, you discover that your mindset changes while you're speaking in one language

2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:47.840
 versus the other.

2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:49.440
 People have told me this.

2:45:49.440 --> 2:45:54.520
 When I speak Russian, I sound more to the point in pragmatic.

2:45:54.520 --> 2:45:56.560
 When I speak Chinese, I sound more cute.

2:45:56.560 --> 2:46:00.920
 When I speak English, I'm something else.

2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:09.120
 I guess there's definitely a richness that you're missing if you're only in one of these

2:46:09.120 --> 2:46:15.360
 language bubbles, but I guess the arguments on the other side would be that if everyone

2:46:15.360 --> 2:46:19.680
 spoke the same language, then there would just be one bubble.

2:46:19.680 --> 2:46:22.600
 This is the challenge, I think.

2:46:22.600 --> 2:46:26.960
 There are actually benefits to having cultural diversity, and you definitely don't want the

2:46:26.960 --> 2:46:29.240
 entire world to be too conformist.

2:46:29.240 --> 2:46:33.920
 One of the interesting things about crypto is that it's just a culture that actually

2:46:33.920 --> 2:46:42.040
 manages to somehow have its uniqueness and preserve its independence from all of these

2:46:42.040 --> 2:46:45.440
 surrounding countries despite being embedded in all of them.

2:46:45.440 --> 2:46:51.760
 It spans outside of the geographic boundaries, and language in some ways does as well.

2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:56.400
 The way these cultures, these bubbles are created, they overlap in interesting ways.

2:46:56.400 --> 2:47:00.080
 It's almost like a hierarchy, and the same is the case with the crypto world.

2:47:00.080 --> 2:47:04.320
 There's communities associated with each cryptocurrency, there's communities within

2:47:04.320 --> 2:47:14.360
 those communities, and it's definitely sad whenever these groups are fighting each other.

2:47:14.360 --> 2:47:21.400
 It's definitely good for them to give people can cooperate more, but at the same time,

2:47:21.400 --> 2:47:28.200
 just having groups of people that have different kinds of life experiences, there's definitely

2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:30.400
 something to benefit from that.

2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:32.000
 So let me ask one last question.

2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:33.880
 I don't think I asked you last time.

2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:37.440
 The ridiculous question about the meaning of life.

2:47:37.440 --> 2:47:44.120
 Dostoevsky said, beauty will save the world.

2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:49.640
 Some people believe money is a big part of happiness, and first of all, you've made a

2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:54.000
 lot of money, you turned away a lot of money, you turned away a lot of power.

2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:59.720
 So you're a fascinating person to ask, what do you think is meaning to life?

2:47:59.720 --> 2:48:05.320
 The thing that I've realized with money as I have experienced both having a little of

2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:14.680
 it and I'm having a lot of it is that the benefit, you can get the most out of money

2:48:14.680 --> 2:48:20.040
 if you think of it not as something that lets you do and have more things, but as something

2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:25.200
 that lets you worry about fewer things.

2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:30.400
 If your savings are just nonzero at all, then you don't have to worry as much about losing

2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:32.760
 your job.

2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:37.680
 If you feel like you have a job that just really conflicts with your values, then if

2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:40.880
 you have even six months saved up that just makes it easier for you to say, bye bye, I'm

2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:42.760
 going to do something else.

2:48:42.760 --> 2:48:52.040
 If you have more money, then you can not worry about even what you're doing, needing to be

2:48:52.040 --> 2:48:53.880
 profitable at all.

2:48:53.880 --> 2:49:00.000
 Once you get more money, then you can choose transportation options and food options that

2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:08.360
 just have less hassle in your life and allow you to be always here.

2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:14.520
 This aspect of just reducing troubles and opening up room for other things, I think

2:49:14.520 --> 2:49:17.680
 is a big part of it.

2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:22.360
 If you instead think of money as being this positive or this thing that gives you stuff

2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:29.160
 and you try to derive meaning from the stuff, I think that's much more likely to be a road

2:49:29.160 --> 2:49:34.040
 to basically squandering that opportunity.

2:49:34.040 --> 2:49:38.760
 My philosophy is definitely more subtractive than added over there.

2:49:38.760 --> 2:49:43.160
 Once you have enough money that you don't have to worry about the money, you're burdened

2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:46.080
 with another question, which is of meaning.

2:49:46.080 --> 2:49:49.120
 Do you think there's meaning to it all?

2:49:49.120 --> 2:49:57.480
 It seems like your own life, you're trying to build cool stuff that alleviates some level

2:49:57.480 --> 2:50:00.080
 of suffering in the world.

2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:05.840
 One way to think about it is think back to how you thought about life when you were in

2:50:05.840 --> 2:50:06.840
 school.

2:50:06.840 --> 2:50:12.640
 In school, this is interesting to think about because in a lot of ways, it's just totally

2:50:12.640 --> 2:50:19.640
 outside of bounds of the kinds of social systems that we live in as adults.

2:50:19.640 --> 2:50:20.640
 Or maybe not.

2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:24.000
 Maybe things like academia are intended to replicate parts of school.

2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:27.080
 First of all, school is very totalitarian.

2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:30.580
 You have to follow the teacher's instructions.

2:50:30.580 --> 2:50:34.240
 The bulk of your schedule is forced to be in particular areas.

2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:44.160
 You can control real preview from weaving the grounds during this period of time, assign

2:50:44.160 --> 2:50:45.520
 a lot of homework.

2:50:45.520 --> 2:50:50.840
 But at the same time, also, school is a bit of a post scarcity utopia in that you just

2:50:50.840 --> 2:50:54.560
 don't have to worry about getting resources for yourself.

2:50:54.560 --> 2:50:58.440
 We've both lived through 12 years of that.

2:50:58.440 --> 2:51:02.160
 What does that say about us?

2:51:02.160 --> 2:51:11.120
 One thing of aspect, obviously, is that there's definitely an easiness to living life if all

2:51:11.120 --> 2:51:14.480
 of your decisions are made for you.

2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:21.680
 One of the challenges of adulthood, I guess, is moving to this world where your choices

2:51:21.680 --> 2:51:26.560
 are much more self directed and you just have to learn to live and deal with that.

2:51:26.560 --> 2:51:32.920
 Yeah, dealing with the burden of freedom in some sense.

2:51:32.920 --> 2:51:39.280
 Actually interesting because in some ways, I feel like even my first five years of doing

2:51:39.280 --> 2:51:45.040
 Ethereum things, my life was not even all that self directed because a lot of it was

2:51:45.040 --> 2:51:47.480
 just responding to obligations.

2:51:47.480 --> 2:51:55.960
 Like someone said, come to speak at this event in Korea, come to speak at this thing in Taiwan.

2:51:55.960 --> 2:52:01.240
 For Ethereum to launch, we need this particular piece to be done and tested.

2:52:01.240 --> 2:52:02.240
 Work on that.

2:52:02.240 --> 2:52:06.760
 We need some proof of stake algorithm, work on that.

2:52:06.760 --> 2:52:15.080
 The last year of COVID life, basically, I was holed up in Singapore for much of it.

2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:18.480
 It gave me a lot more alone time, I had much less travel.

2:52:18.480 --> 2:52:21.800
 That was definitely a very new and interesting experience for me.

2:52:21.800 --> 2:52:31.400
 Would you characterize it by sadness, melancholy, hope, dreaming, like innovative period?

2:52:31.400 --> 2:52:33.560
 How would you characterize that alone time?

2:52:33.560 --> 2:52:37.400
 Some of all five, definitely some self discovery.

2:52:37.400 --> 2:52:44.080
 I definitely did make this very deliberate decision that, okay, I have this time and

2:52:44.080 --> 2:52:49.720
 I'm going to actually make something meaningful out of it.

2:52:49.720 --> 2:52:55.880
 One example of the things I did is I just actually started listening to your audiobooks

2:52:55.880 --> 2:52:57.840
 and podcasts much more.

2:52:57.840 --> 2:53:02.880
 Just this year, I basically discovered that the podcast space is real for the first time,

2:53:02.880 --> 2:53:03.880
 I guess.

2:53:03.880 --> 2:53:10.120
 Before that, there would be things that I would get interviewed for, but I was not mentally

2:53:10.120 --> 2:53:15.120
 incorporate, it's not meant to incorporate this idea that podcasts are a thing that you

2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:16.560
 can go listen to.

2:53:16.560 --> 2:53:17.560
 This year, I did.

2:53:17.560 --> 2:53:24.720
 My friend Carl LaFleur, one of the optimism people, recommended Hardcore History to me.

2:53:24.720 --> 2:53:29.920
 I went ahead and just listened to all the Hardcore Histories, but then after that, I

2:53:29.920 --> 2:53:34.240
 listened to Ted Luxfriedbids and a bunch of others.

2:53:34.240 --> 2:53:41.200
 After that, I also got into audiobooks, oh, I listened to the entire, the rise and fall

2:53:41.200 --> 2:53:44.800
 of the Third Reich, the whole thing, 45 hours.

2:53:44.800 --> 2:53:45.800
 That was fascinating.

2:53:45.800 --> 2:53:50.640
 Let me ask about that, because Dan is going to love hearing this, I'm going to say that.

2:53:50.640 --> 2:53:56.320
 Do you have a period of history, whether it's Dan or in general, that you draw for your

2:53:56.320 --> 2:54:00.720
 own life, like kind of thinking about the world, about human nature that you go to?

2:54:00.720 --> 2:54:01.880
 Is it World War II?

2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:06.200
 Is it Wrath of the Khans, the Jengis Khan?

2:54:06.200 --> 2:54:09.200
 Is it some other more ancient history?

2:54:09.200 --> 2:54:10.400
 Is it World War I?

2:54:10.400 --> 2:54:15.920
 Is there something that kind of echoes with you in the voice of Dan or anyone else that

2:54:15.920 --> 2:54:16.920
 you connect to?

2:54:16.920 --> 2:54:23.120
 I feel like the 1930s and 40s are fascinating because they force you to really grapple with

2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:26.600
 the question of where does evil come from?

2:54:26.600 --> 2:54:33.360
 The sort of mental puzzle that I've always had in my head is on the one hand, things

2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:38.680
 like the Holocaust happened, but on the other hand, if you just go and have a coffee with

2:54:38.680 --> 2:54:45.560
 people, then 100 times out of 100, everyone just seems so nice.

2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:50.560
 How do you reconcile the macro and the micro there?

2:54:50.560 --> 2:54:58.680
 That's the sort of thing that's very difficult if you don't have a lot of, I guess, the right

2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:00.920
 kind of personal experience.

2:55:00.920 --> 2:55:05.520
 Especially if your personal experience starts off being sheltered, like it was for me, right?

2:55:05.520 --> 2:55:09.640
 I know the stereotype is that the nerds get bullied in school, but actually for me, in

2:55:09.640 --> 2:55:14.040
 my school experience was just being treated with kindness by everyone.

2:55:14.040 --> 2:55:17.200
 So that definitely made it harder to understand things.

2:55:17.200 --> 2:55:21.960
 I remember actually being pretty blindsided when I started Ethereum and then within six

2:55:21.960 --> 2:55:27.000
 months there started being fights over who would get more shares if Ethereum turned out

2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:28.000
 to be a company.

2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:31.720
 Then I suggested we should just make it a non profit and somehow that ended up upsetting

2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:36.880
 people.

2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:41.600
 The fascinating thing for me is that I've been obviously reading and listening to the

2:55:41.600 --> 2:55:48.920
 history and then at the same time just observing things happening in the crypto space.

2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:56.000
 One of my interesting mental intuitions that I've gotten is that I think most evil doesn't

2:55:56.000 --> 2:56:00.600
 come out of greed, it comes out of fear.

2:56:00.600 --> 2:56:08.440
 One example of this in Ethereum lands is I think the part of Ethereum history where

2:56:08.440 --> 2:56:11.640
 I thought that the Ethereum community was at its lowest and even when I personally was

2:56:11.640 --> 2:56:12.640
 at my lowest.

2:56:12.640 --> 2:56:18.520
 Now, if you go back to the Dow fork in 2016, the Dow hack happened and then we made this

2:56:18.520 --> 2:56:27.120
 controversial decision to change the Ethereum protocol and then there was that Ethereum

2:56:27.120 --> 2:56:33.640
 classic split and as soon as that Ethereum classic split happened, there was a lot of

2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:40.760
 anger everywhere and there started especially being anger when the price of ETC started

2:56:40.760 --> 2:56:41.760
 taking up.

2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:46.720
 This was the time when Ether started off being $13 and Ethereum classic started at

2:56:46.720 --> 2:56:51.480
 zero, but then suddenly there was this one day when ETH dropped to 12.5, ETC went up

2:56:51.480 --> 2:57:00.600
 to 0.5 and then they dropped more and people were saying things like Ethereum classic is

2:57:00.600 --> 2:57:06.000
 just a Psyop by the Bitcoin community and just a wealthy Bitcoiners trying to destroy

2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:07.840
 Ethereum.

2:57:07.840 --> 2:57:11.240
 In the back of my mind, I knew that that wasn't entirely true.

2:57:11.240 --> 2:57:16.600
 There were definitely more Bitcoiners, but at the same time, I think blaming political

2:57:16.600 --> 2:57:24.520
 or blaming disagreements on foreign interference, this is the thing that countries and governments

2:57:24.520 --> 2:57:26.080
 do all the time.

2:57:26.080 --> 2:57:31.920
 It's a very convenient excuse because it allows you to blame these things that are happening

2:57:31.920 --> 2:57:37.880
 on the foreigners and avoid actually grappling with the fact that actually you have people

2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:44.000
 in your very own community who disagree with you and have a different belief.

2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:48.640
 I feel like the Ethereum community during that time did not do a very good job of grappling

2:57:48.640 --> 2:57:52.760
 with that and I feel like I during that time did not do a very good job of grappling with

2:57:52.760 --> 2:57:53.760
 that.

2:57:53.760 --> 2:57:56.320
 There was a lot of blaming the Bitcoiners.

2:57:56.320 --> 2:58:01.160
 There were also even a lot of people calling for us to use trademark law and basically

2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:06.200
 sue exchanges and try to prevent them from listing Ethereum classic.

2:58:06.200 --> 2:58:11.680
 To me, that was very unethical.

2:58:11.680 --> 2:58:17.160
 Basically using the government as a weapon to try to attack the other cryptocurrency

2:58:17.160 --> 2:58:20.520
 and destroy it as it goes completely against them.

2:58:20.520 --> 2:58:27.640
 The idea was of freedom and things that at least in theory were supposed to stand for.

2:58:27.640 --> 2:58:32.800
 In that particular time, basically what was happening was that the ETC price was rising

2:58:32.800 --> 2:58:38.040
 and at the same time, the ETH price was dropping in lockstep and there were a lot of Bitcoin

2:58:38.040 --> 2:58:41.480
 people basically saying, this is the end of Ethereum and I think a lot of people really

2:58:41.480 --> 2:58:46.320
 were afraid that Ethereum would be just completely destroyed as a result of this.

2:58:46.320 --> 2:58:50.640
 That's where the anger came from that fear.

2:58:50.640 --> 2:58:56.360
 It came from the fear and that's what allowed people to rationalize like an abandonment

2:58:56.360 --> 2:59:02.400
 of principles that I think they would not have accepted in other circumstances.

2:59:02.400 --> 2:59:08.680
 I definitely, to some extent, played along with this myself and I do definitely regret

2:59:08.680 --> 2:59:11.120
 that to some extent.

2:59:11.120 --> 2:59:17.240
 I definitely regret the excesses completely.

2:59:17.240 --> 2:59:24.640
 Then obviously, Bitcoin block size war, similar stuff happened.

2:59:24.640 --> 2:59:31.760
 That insight was interesting because it does mentally make a lot of sense when you're actually

2:59:31.760 --> 2:59:36.480
 afraid that unless you act in some way that your entire world is going to collapse, it's

2:59:36.480 --> 2:59:40.760
 much easier to just rationalize forgetting your principles and doing whatever you have

2:59:40.760 --> 2:59:44.320
 to to just save the specific thing that you care about.

2:59:44.320 --> 2:59:52.320
 It feels like the right thing to do, the brave thing to do is in the face of fear to still

2:59:52.320 --> 2:59:58.360
 have compassion, to still have love as opposed to hate.

2:59:58.360 --> 3:00:05.880
 The toughest moments of human history are those where fear is everywhere and despite

3:00:05.880 --> 3:00:15.040
 that, the way to get out of that is through love, not giving into the fear.

3:00:15.040 --> 3:00:20.720
 Again, that's the lesson that you draw from all those moments of history.

3:00:20.720 --> 3:00:21.720
 Yeah.

3:00:21.720 --> 3:00:26.440
 Well, I like you have in terms of those coffee and the kindness that people have, it does

3:00:26.440 --> 3:00:31.840
 seem that everybody has the capacity for evil and everybody has the capacity for love and

3:00:31.840 --> 3:00:38.280
 you just have to create mechanisms and incentives that prioritize the latter over the former.

3:00:38.280 --> 3:00:44.400
 Vitalik, you're one of the most interesting people I've gotten a chance to talk to.

3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:45.560
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

3:00:45.560 --> 3:00:47.520
 I hope we get a chance to talk again.

3:00:47.520 --> 3:00:50.120
 I hope I can at least be some small part.

3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:53.240
 This would be awesome on a podcast with you and Dan Carlin.

3:00:53.240 --> 3:00:56.680
 That would be an awesome conversation.

3:00:56.680 --> 3:01:03.520
 Thank you so much for doing so much incredible technical innovation that inspires the computer

3:01:03.520 --> 3:01:09.120
 scientists, the economists, inspires the world and what technology can do.

3:01:09.120 --> 3:01:18.360
 And now with longevity, I do hope we live a very long time and play Diablo to make that

3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:19.860
 long time fun.

3:01:19.860 --> 3:01:21.160
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

3:01:21.160 --> 3:01:22.160
 Thank you too, Lex.

3:01:22.160 --> 3:01:23.160
 This was great.

3:01:23.160 --> 3:01:26.480
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Vitalik Buterin.

3:01:26.480 --> 3:01:33.120
 Thank you to Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon, Indeed, ForSigmatic and BetterHelp.

3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:36.880
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:41.080
 And now let me leave you with some words from Nelson Mandela.

3:01:41.080 --> 3:01:46.320
 When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, he has no choice but

3:01:46.320 --> 3:01:49.200
 to become an outlaw.

3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:59.200
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
