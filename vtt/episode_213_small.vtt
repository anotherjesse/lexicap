00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
 The following is a conversation with Barry Barish, a theoretical physicist at Caltech

00:05.360 --> 00:11.440
 and the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the LIGO detector

00:11.440 --> 00:17.760
 and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO, or the Laser Interferometer Gravitational

00:17.760 --> 00:24.320
 Wave Observatory, is probably the most precise measurement device ever built by humans.

00:24.320 --> 00:31.680
 It consists of two detectors with four kilometer long vacuum chambers situated three thousand

00:31.680 --> 00:39.040
 kilometers apart, operating in unison to measure a motion that is 10,000 times smaller than the

00:39.040 --> 00:45.680
 width of a proton. It is the smallest measurement ever attempted by science, a measurement of

00:45.680 --> 00:50.960
 gravitational waves caused by the most violent and cataclysmic events in the universe,

00:50.960 --> 00:58.160
 occurring over tens of millions of light years away. To support this podcast, please check out

00:58.160 --> 01:05.280
 our sponsors in the description. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation

01:05.280 --> 01:11.280
 with Barry Barish. You've mentioned that you were always curious about the physical world

01:11.280 --> 01:15.600
 and that an early question you remember stood out where you asked your dad,

01:15.600 --> 01:21.120
 why does ice float on water? And he couldn't answer. And this was very surprising to you.

01:22.240 --> 01:28.240
 So, you went on to learn why. Maybe you can speak to what are some early questions in math

01:28.240 --> 01:37.760
 and physics that really sparked your curiosity? Yeah, that memory is kind of something I used

01:37.760 --> 01:44.080
 to illustrate, something I think that's common in science is that people that do science somehow

01:44.080 --> 01:52.800
 have maintained something that kids always have. A small kid, eight years old or so,

01:55.040 --> 02:00.160
 asks you so many questions usually, typically that you consider them pests, you tell them to

02:00.160 --> 02:07.760
 stop asking so many questions. And somehow our system manages to kill that in most people.

02:07.760 --> 02:16.800
 So, in school we make people do study and do their things, but not to pester them by asking too many

02:16.800 --> 02:26.000
 questions. And I think not just myself, but I think it's typical of scientists like myself that

02:27.520 --> 02:33.440
 have somehow escaped that. Maybe we're still children or maybe we somehow didn't get it beaten

02:33.440 --> 02:41.200
 out of us, but I teach it in college level and it's, to me, one of the biggest deficits is the lack

02:41.200 --> 02:46.560
 of curiosity, if you want, that we've beaten out of them because I think it's an innate human

02:46.560 --> 02:51.120
 quality. Is there some advice or insights you can give to how to keep that flame of curiosity going?

02:51.120 --> 02:58.000
 I think it's a problem of both parents and the parents should realize that's a great quality we

02:58.000 --> 03:04.560
 have, that you're curious and that's good. Instead, we have expressions like curiosity killed the cat.

03:06.320 --> 03:14.800
 And more, but basically it's not thought to be a good thing. Curiosity killed the cat

03:14.800 --> 03:20.080
 means if you're too curious, you get in trouble. I don't like cats anyway, so maybe it's a good

03:20.080 --> 03:28.960
 thing. Yeah, that, to me, needs to be solved really in education and in homes. It's a realization

03:28.960 --> 03:34.480
 that there's certain human qualities that we should try to build on and not destroy one of

03:34.480 --> 03:40.880
 them is curiosity. Anyway, back to me in curiosity, I was a pest and asked a lot of questions. My

03:40.880 --> 03:47.600
 father generally could answer them at that age. And the first one I remember that he couldn't answer

03:47.600 --> 03:57.280
 was not a very original question, but basically that ice is made out of water. And so why does it

03:57.280 --> 04:06.240
 float on water? And he couldn't answer it. And it may not have been the first question. It's the

04:06.240 --> 04:14.000
 first one that I remember. And that was the first time that I realized that to learn and answer your

04:14.000 --> 04:19.120
 own curiosity or questions, there's various mechanisms. In this case, it was going to a

04:19.120 --> 04:25.440
 librarian or asking people who know more and so forth. But eventually you do it by what we call

04:25.440 --> 04:34.800
 research. But it's driven by if you're, hopefully you ask good questions. If you ask good questions

04:34.800 --> 04:39.920
 and you have the mechanisms to solve them, then you do what I do in life basically, not necessarily

04:39.920 --> 04:45.600
 physics, but and it's a great quality in humans and we should nurture it.

04:46.480 --> 04:53.760
 Do you remember any other kind of in high school, maybe early college, more basic physics ideas

04:54.320 --> 04:57.360
 that sparked your curiosity or mathematics or science in general?

04:57.360 --> 05:03.040
 I wasn't really into science until I got to college, to be honest with you. But

05:03.040 --> 05:14.880
 just staying with water for a minute, I remembered that I was curious why what happens to water,

05:14.880 --> 05:19.200
 you know, it rains and there's water in a wet pavement and then the pavement dries out. What

05:19.200 --> 05:24.800
 happened to this water that came down? And I, you know, I didn't know that much. And then eventually

05:24.800 --> 05:30.080
 I learned in chemistry or something and water is made out of hydrogen and oxygen. Those are both

05:30.080 --> 05:33.520
 gases. So how the heck does it make this substances liquid?

05:37.440 --> 05:45.280
 Yeah, but so that has to do with states of matter. You've, I know, perhaps LIGO and the thing for

05:45.280 --> 05:51.760
 which you've gotten the Nobel Prize and the things much of your life work, perhaps was a happy

05:51.760 --> 05:57.040
 accident in some sense in the early days. But is there a moment where you looked up to the stars

05:57.040 --> 06:01.360
 and also the same way you wondered about water, wondered about some of the things that are out

06:01.360 --> 06:10.880
 there in the universe? Oh yeah, I think everybody's looks and is in awe and is curious about what it

06:10.880 --> 06:16.640
 is out there. And, you know, and as I learned more, I learned, of course, that we don't know very

06:16.640 --> 06:22.000
 much about what's there. And the more we learn, the more we know, we don't know. I mean, we don't

06:22.000 --> 06:28.560
 know what the majority of anything is out there. It's all what we call dark matter or dark energy.

06:28.560 --> 06:33.360
 And that's one of the big questions 20 year when I was a student, those weren't questions. So we

06:33.360 --> 06:40.720
 even know less in a sense, the more we the more we look. So of course, I think that's one of the

06:40.720 --> 06:48.560
 areas that almost it's universal people see the sky, they see the stars and they're beautiful and

06:48.560 --> 06:54.400
 and see it looks different on different nights. And it's a curiosity that we all have.

06:55.680 --> 07:02.480
 What are some questions about the universe that in the same way that you felt about the ice

07:03.120 --> 07:08.560
 that today you mentioned to me offline, you're teaching a course on the frontiers of science,

07:08.560 --> 07:14.560
 frontiers of physics. Yeah. What are some questions outside the ones we'll probably talk about that

07:14.560 --> 07:25.120
 kind of? Yeah, fill you with get your flame of curiosity up and firing up. Yeah, you know,

07:25.120 --> 07:30.800
 fill you with all. Well, first, I'm a physicist, not an astronomer. So I'm interested in physical

07:30.800 --> 07:38.480
 the physical phenomenon really. So the question of dark matter and dark energy, which we probably

07:38.480 --> 07:44.640
 won't talk about our recent our recent there in the last 20, 30 years for certainly dark energy.

07:45.280 --> 07:51.360
 Dark energy is that complete puzzle. It goes against what I will what you will ask me about,

07:51.360 --> 07:57.440
 which is general relativity and Einstein's general relativity, it basically takes something

07:57.440 --> 08:05.760
 that he thought was what he what he called a constant, which isn't and and in the if that's

08:05.760 --> 08:11.920
 even the right theory and it represents most of the universe. And then we have something called

08:11.920 --> 08:19.840
 dark matter and there's good reason to believe it might be an exotic form of particles. And that

08:19.840 --> 08:25.120
 is something I've always worked on on particle accelerators and so forth. And it's a big puzzle

08:25.120 --> 08:30.400
 what it is. It's a bit of a cottage industry and that there's lots and lots of searches.

08:30.400 --> 08:36.320
 But it may be a little bit like, you know, looking for a treasure under rocks or something,

08:36.320 --> 08:42.240
 you know, it's hard to we don't have really good guidance, except that we have very,

08:42.240 --> 08:50.960
 very good information that is pervasive and it's there. And that it's probably particles small

08:51.760 --> 08:59.360
 that the evidence is all of those things. But then the most logical solution doesn't seem to work

08:59.360 --> 09:07.200
 something called supersymmetry. And do you think the answer could be something very complicated?

09:08.640 --> 09:14.880
 You know, I like to hope that think that most things that appear complicated are actually

09:14.880 --> 09:21.680
 simple if you really understand them. I think we just don't know at the present time and it isn't

09:21.680 --> 09:28.800
 something that affects us. It does affect it affects how the stars go around each other and so

09:28.800 --> 09:35.040
 forth, because we detect that there's missing gravity, but but it doesn't affect everyday life

09:35.040 --> 09:44.400
 at all. I tend to think and expect maybe and that the answers will be simple. We just haven't found

09:44.400 --> 09:50.480
 it yet. Do you think those answers might change the way we see other sources of gravity, black holes,

09:51.120 --> 09:58.480
 the way we see the parts of the universe that we do study? It's conceivable. The

09:58.480 --> 10:04.880
 black holes that we've found in our experiment and we're trying now to understand the origin of

10:04.880 --> 10:12.560
 those. It's conceivable, but not doesn't seem the most likely that they're primordial. That is,

10:12.560 --> 10:17.200
 they were made at the beginning and they in that sense they could represent at least part of the

10:17.200 --> 10:24.320
 dark matter. So there can be connections, dark black holes or how many there are, how much of the

10:24.320 --> 10:29.920
 mass they encompass is still pretty primitive. We don't know. So before I talk to you more about

10:29.920 --> 10:35.040
 black holes, let me take a step back to yeah. I was actually went to high school in Chicago and

10:35.040 --> 10:43.920
 would go to take classes at Fermilab, watch the Buffalo and so on. Yeah. So let me ask about,

10:43.920 --> 10:49.440
 you mentioned that Enrico for me was somebody who was inspiring to you in a certain kind of way.

10:49.440 --> 10:57.440
 Why is that? Can you speak to that? Sure. He was amazing actually. He's the last,

10:58.640 --> 11:04.080
 this is not the, I'll come to the reason in a minute, but he had a big influence on me at a

11:04.080 --> 11:14.240
 young age. But he was the last physicist of note that was both an experimental physicist

11:14.240 --> 11:22.080
 and a theorist at the same time. And he did two amazing things within months in 1933.

11:24.560 --> 11:32.400
 We didn't really know what the nucleus was, what radioactive decay was, what beta decay was

11:32.400 --> 11:45.440
 when electrons come out of a nucleus. And near the end of 1933, the neutron had just been discovered.

11:45.440 --> 11:49.760
 And that meant that we knew a little bit more about what the nucleus is that it's made out of

11:49.760 --> 11:57.280
 neutrons and protons. The neutron wasn't discovered till 1932. And then once we discovered that there

11:57.280 --> 12:02.640
 was a neutron and proton and they made the nucleus and then their electrons that go around,

12:02.640 --> 12:10.240
 the basic ingredients were there. And he wrote down not only just the theory, a theory, but a

12:10.240 --> 12:19.280
 theory that lasted decades and has only been improved on of beta decay. That is the radiation.

12:19.280 --> 12:26.800
 He did this, came out of nowhere. And it was a fantastic theory. He submitted it to Nature

12:26.800 --> 12:34.880
 Magazine, which was the primary best place to publish even then. And it got rejected as being too

12:36.000 --> 12:42.960
 speculative. And so he went back to his drawing board in Rome where he was,

12:43.840 --> 12:50.160
 added some to it, made it even longer, because it's really a classic article and then published it in

12:50.160 --> 12:59.600
 the local Italian Journal for Physics and the German one. At the same time, in January of

12:59.600 --> 13:08.400
 1932, Giulio and Curie for the first time saw artificial radioactivity. This was an important

13:08.400 --> 13:15.120
 discovery because radioactivity had been discovered much earlier. They had x rays and you

13:15.120 --> 13:20.800
 shouldn't be using them, but there was radioactivity. People knew it was useful for medicine.

13:22.480 --> 13:28.000
 But radioactive materials are hard to find. And so it wasn't prevalent. But if you could make them,

13:28.560 --> 13:37.040
 then they had great use. And Giulio and Curie were able to bombard aluminum or something with alpha

13:37.040 --> 13:45.200
 particles and find that they excited something that decayed and gave, decayed and had some half

13:45.200 --> 13:51.600
 life and so forth, meaning it was artificial version or let's call it not a natural version,

13:51.600 --> 14:04.960
 an induced version of radioactive materials. And Fermi somehow had the insight, and I still

14:04.960 --> 14:12.480
 can't see where he got it, that the right way to follow that up was not using charged particles

14:12.480 --> 14:19.120
 like alphas and so forth, but use these newly discovered neutrons as the bombarding particle.

14:20.320 --> 14:27.040
 Seemed impossible. They barely had been seen. It was hard to get very many of them. But it had the

14:27.040 --> 14:36.480
 advantage that they're not charged, so they go right into the nucleus. And that turned out to be

14:36.480 --> 14:42.320
 the experimental work that he did that won him the Nobel Prize. And it was the first step in

14:42.320 --> 14:49.840
 fission, discovery of fission. And he did this two completely different things, an experiment that

14:49.840 --> 14:58.000
 was a great idea and tremendous implementation, because how do you get enough neutrons? And then

14:58.000 --> 15:04.800
 he learned quickly that not only do you want neutrons, but you want really slow ones. He learned

15:04.800 --> 15:09.920
 that experimentally, and he learned how to make slow ones. And then they were able to make go

15:09.920 --> 15:16.960
 through the periodic table and make lots of particles. He missed on fission at the moment,

15:16.960 --> 15:21.760
 but he had the basic information. And then fission followed soon after that.

15:21.760 --> 15:27.280
 Forgive me for not knowing, but is the birth of the idea of bombarding with neutrons,

15:29.200 --> 15:35.760
 is that an experimental idea? Was it born out of an experiment? He just observed something?

15:35.760 --> 15:40.080
 Or is this an Einstein style idea where you come up from basic intuition?

15:40.080 --> 15:46.560
 I think it took a combination, because he realized that neutrons had a characteristic

15:46.560 --> 15:51.840
 that would allow them to go all the way into the nucleus when we didn't really understand what the

15:54.080 --> 16:00.640
 structure was of all this. So that took an understanding or recognition of the physics

16:00.640 --> 16:06.640
 itself of how a neutron interacts compared to, say, an alpha particle that Julio and Curie had used.

16:07.360 --> 16:16.320
 And then he had to invent a way to have enough neutrons. And he had a team of associates

16:16.320 --> 16:20.560
 and he pulled it off quite quickly. So it was pretty astounding.

16:21.920 --> 16:28.640
 And probably, maybe you can speak to it, his ability to put together the engineering aspects

16:28.640 --> 16:34.080
 of great experiments and doing the theory, they probably fed each other. I wonder, can you speak

16:34.080 --> 16:37.840
 to why we don't see more of that? Is that just really difficult to do?

16:38.480 --> 16:45.280
 It's difficult to do. Yeah, I think both theory and experiment in physics anyway

16:45.280 --> 16:52.800
 was conceivable if you had the right person to do it and no one's been able to do it since.

16:52.800 --> 16:56.480
 So I had the dream that that was what I was going to be like Fermi.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.640
 So you love both sides of it, the theory.

16:58.640 --> 17:03.360
 Yeah, I never liked the idea that you did experiments without really understanding

17:03.360 --> 17:07.200
 the theory or the theory should be related very closely to experiments.

17:07.200 --> 17:15.120
 And so I've always done experimental work that was closely related to the theoretical ideas.

17:15.120 --> 17:18.640
 I think I told you I'm Russian, so I'm going to ask some romantic questions.

17:18.640 --> 17:25.200
 But is it tragic to you that he's seen as the architect of the nuclear age,

17:25.200 --> 17:33.600
 that some of his creations led to potentially some of his work has led to potentially still

17:33.600 --> 17:38.560
 the destruction of the human species, some of the most destructive weapons?

17:41.520 --> 17:48.160
 I think even more general than him, I gave you all the virtues of curiosity a few minutes ago.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.120
 There's an interesting book called The Ratchet of Curiosity,

17:51.120 --> 17:53.520
 you know, a ratchet is something that goes in one direction.

17:54.240 --> 18:00.080
 And that is written by a guy who's probably a sociologist or philosopher or something.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.760
 And he picks on this particular problem, but other ones.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.800
 And that is the danger of knowledge, basically.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.520
 You know, you're curious, you learn something.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.760
 So it's a little bit like curiosity killed the cat.

18:11.760 --> 18:16.080
 You have to be worried about whether you can handle new information that you get.

18:16.080 --> 18:21.280
 So in this case, the new information had to do with really understanding nuclear physics.

18:22.320 --> 18:29.520
 And that information, maybe we didn't have the sophistication to know how to keep it

18:29.520 --> 18:30.640
 keep it under control.

18:31.920 --> 18:36.960
 And Fermi himself was a very apolitical person.

18:36.960 --> 18:43.280
 So he wasn't very driven by or at least he appears in all of his writing,

18:43.280 --> 18:48.400
 the writing of his wife, the interactions that others had with him as either he avoided it all

18:48.400 --> 18:49.920
 or he was pretty apolitical.

18:49.920 --> 18:54.320
 I mean, he just saw the world through kind of the lens of a scientist.

18:54.320 --> 19:01.040
 But he asked if it's tragic that the bomb was tragic, certainly on Japan.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.640
 And he had a role in that.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.680
 So I wouldn't want it as my legacy, for example.

19:06.640 --> 19:13.200
 I mean, but brought it to the human species that it's the ratchet of curiosity that we

19:16.960 --> 19:19.040
 we do stuff just to see what happens.

19:19.040 --> 19:24.960
 That that curiosity that in sort of my area of artificial intelligence, that's been a concern.

19:24.960 --> 19:30.400
 They're on a small scale, on a silly scale, perhaps currently, there's constantly

19:31.200 --> 19:32.640
 unintended consequences.

19:32.640 --> 19:38.800
 You create a system and you put it out there and you have intuitions about how it will work.

19:38.800 --> 19:42.400
 You have hopes how it will work, but you put it out there just to see what happens.

19:42.400 --> 19:47.440
 And in most cases, because artificial intelligence is currently not super popular,

19:47.440 --> 19:49.680
 artificial intelligence is currently not super powerful.

19:49.680 --> 19:54.160
 It doesn't create large scale negative effects.

19:54.800 --> 20:01.440
 But that same curiosity as it progresses might lead to something that destroys the human species.

20:01.440 --> 20:04.720
 And the same may be true for bioengineering.

20:04.720 --> 20:12.400
 There's people that, you know, engineer viruses to protect us from viruses,

20:12.400 --> 20:19.040
 to see, you know, how close is this to mutating so it can jump to humans, or going, you know,

20:19.040 --> 20:22.720
 or engineering defenses against those.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.240
 And it seems exciting in the application.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.720
 The positive applications are really exciting at this time.

20:28.720 --> 20:34.480
 But we don't think about how that runs away in decades to come.

20:34.480 --> 20:39.280
 Yeah. And I think it's the same idea as this little book, The Ratchet of Science,

20:39.280 --> 20:43.040
 The Ratchet of Curiosity.

20:43.040 --> 20:50.880
 I mean, whether you pursue, take curiosity and let artificial intelligence or machine

20:50.880 --> 20:56.000
 learning run away with having its solutions to whatever you want, or we do it,

20:56.560 --> 20:59.040
 is, I think, a similar consequence.

20:59.600 --> 21:07.600
 I think from what I've read about Enrico Fermi, he became a little bit cynical about the human

21:07.600 --> 21:11.760
 species towards the end of his life, both having observed what he observed.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.680
 We didn't write much. I mean, he died young.

21:15.680 --> 21:19.120
 He died soon after the World War.

21:20.240 --> 21:26.320
 There was already, you know, the work by Teller to develop the hydrogen bomb.

21:26.320 --> 21:30.080
 And I think he was a little cynical of that, you know, pushing it even further and

21:31.120 --> 21:35.600
 rising tensions between the Soviet Union and the U.S. and look like an endless thing.

21:35.600 --> 21:39.680
 So, but he didn't say very much, but a little bit, as you said that.

21:39.680 --> 21:46.080
 Yeah, there's a few clips to sort of maybe picked on a bad mood, but in a sense that,

21:46.080 --> 21:54.080
 almost like a sadness, a melancholy sadness, to a hope that waned a little bit about that,

21:54.800 --> 22:00.480
 perhaps we can do, like this curious species can find the way out.

22:01.120 --> 22:05.360
 Well, especially, I think people who worked like he did at Los Alamos and spent

22:05.360 --> 22:10.640
 years of their life somehow had to convince themselves that dropping these bombs would bring

22:11.360 --> 22:14.320
 lasting peace and that it didn't.

22:17.200 --> 22:22.560
 As a small, interesting aside, it'd be interesting to hear if you have opinions on this.

22:22.560 --> 22:29.120
 His name is also attached to the Fermi Paradox, which asks if there is a, you know,

22:29.120 --> 22:34.880
 with Fermi, it's a very interesting question, which is if it does seem, if you sort of reason,

22:34.880 --> 22:39.280
 basically, that there should be a lot of alien civilizations out there.

22:39.280 --> 22:46.960
 If the human species, if Earth is not that unique by basic, no matter the values you pick,

22:48.640 --> 22:51.680
 it's likely that there's a lot of alien civilizations out there.

22:51.680 --> 22:58.480
 And if that's the case, why have they not at least obviously visited us or sent us loud

22:58.480 --> 23:00.080
 signals that everybody can hear?

23:00.720 --> 23:09.200
 Fermi's quoted as saying, sitting down at lunch, I think it was with Teller and Herb York,

23:09.200 --> 23:12.880
 who was kind of one of the fathers of the atomic bomb.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.160
 And he sat down and he said something like, where are they?

23:17.680 --> 23:20.000
 Which meant, where are these other?

23:20.000 --> 23:29.280
 And then he did some numerology where he calculated what they knew about how many

23:30.960 --> 23:35.760
 galaxies there are and how many stars and how many planets then are like the Earth and blah,

23:35.760 --> 23:36.640
 blah, blah.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.360
 That's been done much better by somebody named Drake.

23:40.400 --> 23:44.080
 And so people usually refer to the, I don't know whether it's called the Drake formula

23:44.080 --> 23:45.920
 or something, but it has the same conclusion.

23:45.920 --> 23:50.080
 The conclusion is it would be a miracle if there weren't other,

23:51.680 --> 23:55.680
 there's the statistics are so high that how can we be singular and separate?

23:58.320 --> 24:04.480
 That's so probably there is, but there's almost certainly life somewhere.

24:04.480 --> 24:10.000
 Maybe there was even life on Mars a while back, but intelligent life.

24:11.440 --> 24:15.280
 Probably why are we so, so the statistics say that.

24:15.280 --> 24:20.240
 Communicating with us, I think that it's harder than people think.

24:22.800 --> 24:29.120
 We might not know the right way to expect the communication.

24:30.560 --> 24:35.520
 But all the communication that we know about travels at the speed of light.

24:36.960 --> 24:41.040
 And we don't, we don't think anything can go faster in the speed of light.

24:41.040 --> 24:44.160
 That limits the problem quite a bit.

24:44.160 --> 24:49.280
 And it makes it difficult to have any back and forth communication.

24:49.280 --> 24:54.640
 You can send signals like we tried to or look for, but to have any communication,

24:54.640 --> 24:58.560
 it's pretty hard when you, it has to be close enough that the speed of light

24:59.760 --> 25:02.000
 would mean we could communicate with each other.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.600
 And I think, and we didn't even understand that.

25:05.600 --> 25:09.360
 I mean, we're an advanced civilization, but we didn't even understand that

25:10.560 --> 25:12.080
 a little more than a hundred years ago.

25:12.080 --> 25:22.560
 So are we just not advanced enough maybe to know something about that's the speed of light?

25:22.560 --> 25:26.880
 Maybe there's some other way to communicate that isn't based on electromagnetism.

25:26.880 --> 25:28.080
 I don't, I don't know.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.840
 Gravity seems to be also this have the same speed.

25:31.840 --> 25:35.920
 That was a principle that Einstein had and something we've measured actually.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.160
 So is it possible?

25:38.160 --> 25:40.720
 I mean, so we'll talk about gravitational waves.

25:40.720 --> 25:46.880
 And it, in some sense, there's a, there's a brainstorming going on,

25:46.880 --> 25:50.240
 which is like, how do we detect the signal?

25:50.240 --> 25:52.800
 Like what would a signal look like and how would we detect it?

25:52.800 --> 25:54.320
 And that's true for gravitational waves.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.880
 That's true for basically any physics phenomena.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.520
 You have to predict that that signal should exist.

25:59.520 --> 26:03.120
 You have to have some kind of theory and model why that signal should exist.

26:03.120 --> 26:07.120
 I mean, is it possible that aliens are communicating with us via gravity?

26:08.720 --> 26:09.440
 Like why not?

26:09.440 --> 26:13.360
 Well, yeah, it's true.

26:13.360 --> 26:13.840
 Why not?

26:14.880 --> 26:18.880
 For us, it's very hard to detect these gravitational effects.

26:18.880 --> 26:23.360
 They have to come from something pretty that has a lot of gravity like black holes.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.960
 But we're pretty primitive at this stage.

26:29.200 --> 26:35.680
 There's a very reputable physicists that look for a fifth force,

26:36.480 --> 26:38.000
 one that we haven't found yet.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.600
 Maybe it's the key.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.320
 What would that look like?

26:42.320 --> 26:45.040
 What would a fifth force of physics look like exactly?

26:45.040 --> 26:50.080
 Well, usually they think it's probably a longer range force than we have now.

26:51.680 --> 26:58.080
 But they're reputable for colleagues of mine that spend their life looking for a fifth force.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.680
 So longer range than gravity?

27:01.680 --> 27:06.480
 It doesn't fall off like one over r squared, but maybe separately.

27:06.480 --> 27:13.040
 Gravity Newton taught us goes like inversely, one over the square of the distance apart you are.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.240
 So it falls pretty fast.

27:14.240 --> 27:14.720
 That's okay.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.640
 So now we have a theory of what consciousness is.

27:16.640 --> 27:19.600
 It's just the fifth force of physics.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.040
 There we go.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.240
 That's a good hypothesis.

27:26.320 --> 27:31.520
 Speaking of gravity, what are gravitational waves?

27:31.520 --> 27:32.960
 Let's maybe start from the basics.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.920
 We learned gravity from Newton.

27:37.120 --> 27:37.600
 Right?

27:37.600 --> 27:39.520
 You and you were young.

27:39.520 --> 27:42.560
 You were told that if you jumped up, the earth pulled you down.

27:43.840 --> 27:48.320
 And when the apple falls out of the tree, the earth pulls it down.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.240
 And maybe you even asked your teacher why.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.440
 But most of us accepted that.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.520
 That was Newton's picture, the apple falling out of the tree.

27:59.520 --> 28:03.440
 But Newton's theory never told you why the apple was attracted to the earth.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.720
 That was a missing in Newton's theory.

28:08.160 --> 28:13.360
 Newton's theory also, Newton recognized at least one of the two problems I'll tell you.

28:13.360 --> 28:18.320
 One of them is there's more than those, but one is why does the earth?

28:18.320 --> 28:24.320
 What's the mechanism by which the earth pulls the apple or holds the moon when it goes around,

28:24.320 --> 28:25.040
 whatever it is?

28:26.160 --> 28:27.680
 That's not explained by Newton.

28:27.680 --> 28:30.800
 Even though he has the most successful theory of physics ever,

28:30.800 --> 28:34.880
 went 200 in some years with nobody ever seeing violation.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.880
 But he actually describes the movement of an object falling down to earth,

28:38.880 --> 28:42.960
 but he's not answering why that, because it's a distance.

28:42.960 --> 28:50.080
 He gives a formula, which it's a product of the earth's mass, the apple's mass,

28:50.080 --> 28:53.360
 inversely proportional to the square, the distance between.

28:53.360 --> 28:58.240
 And then the strength he called capital G, the strength he couldn't determine,

28:58.240 --> 29:00.160
 but it was determined 100 years later.

29:00.880 --> 29:06.960
 But no one ever saw a violation of this until a possible violation, which Einstein fixed,

29:06.960 --> 29:10.400
 which was very small, that has to do with Mercury going around the sun.

29:11.360 --> 29:16.800
 The orbit being slightly wrong if you calculate it by Newton's theory.

29:16.800 --> 29:25.360
 But, so, like most theories then in physics, you can have a wonderful one like Newton's theory.

29:25.360 --> 29:33.760
 It isn't wrong, but you have to have an improvement on it to answer things that it can't answer.

29:33.760 --> 29:37.520
 And in this case, Einstein's theory is the next step.

29:37.520 --> 29:44.560
 We don't know if it's anything like a final theory or even the only way to formulate it either.

29:44.560 --> 29:51.520
 But he formulated this theory, which he released in 1915.

29:53.520 --> 29:58.880
 He took 10 years to develop it, even though in 1905 he solved three or four of the most

29:58.880 --> 30:01.280
 important problems in physics in a matter of months.

30:01.280 --> 30:05.520
 And then he spent 10 years on this problem before he let it out.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.200
 And this is called general relativity.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.720
 It's a new theory of gravity.

30:08.720 --> 30:21.520
 In 1915 and 1916, Einstein wrote a little paper where he did not do some fancy derivation.

30:21.520 --> 30:30.800
 Instead, he did, what I would call it, used his intuition, which he was very good at too.

30:30.800 --> 30:39.280
 And that is, he noticed that if he wrote the formulas for general relativity in a particular way,

30:40.080 --> 30:43.680
 they looked a lot like the formulas for electricity and magnetism.

30:45.760 --> 30:51.840
 Being Einstein, he then took the leap that electricity and magnetism, we discovered only

30:51.840 --> 30:56.240
 20 years before that in the 1880s, have waves.

30:56.240 --> 31:01.520
 Of course, that's light and electromagnetic rays, radio waves, everything else.

31:01.520 --> 31:07.280
 So he said, if the formulas look similar, then gravity probably has waves too.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.000
 That's such a big leap, by the way.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.040
 I mean, maybe you can correct me, but that just seems like a heck of a leap.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.880
 Yeah, and it was considered to be a heck of a leap.

31:18.880 --> 31:27.920
 So first, that paper, except for this intuition, was poorly written, had a serious mistake.

31:27.920 --> 31:33.280
 It had a factor of two wrong in the strength of gravity, which meant, if we use those formulas,

31:33.280 --> 31:39.200
 we would, and two years later, he wrote a second paper.

31:40.080 --> 31:45.440
 And in that paper, it turns out to be important for us, because in that paper, he not only

31:45.440 --> 31:50.000
 fixed his factor of two mistake, which he never admitted.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.720
 He just wrote it, fixed it like he always did.

31:53.760 --> 32:00.320
 And then he told us how you make gravitational waves, what makes gravitational waves.

32:00.960 --> 32:06.640
 And you might recall, in electromagnetism, we make electromagnetic waves in a simple way.

32:06.640 --> 32:10.720
 You take a plus charge and minus charge, you oscillate like this, and that makes

32:10.720 --> 32:16.960
 electromagnetic waves, and a physicist named Hertz made a receiver that could detect the waves

32:16.960 --> 32:18.160
 and put it in the next room.

32:18.800 --> 32:23.120
 He saw them and moved forward and backward and saw that it was wave like.

32:23.120 --> 32:27.680
 So Einstein said it won't be a dipole like that.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.200
 It'll be a four pole thing.

32:29.200 --> 32:34.560
 And that's what it's called a quadrupole moment that gives the gravitational waves.

32:34.560 --> 32:37.920
 So he saw that again by insight, not by derivation.

32:37.920 --> 32:41.120
 That's at the table for which he needed to do it.

32:41.120 --> 32:46.800
 At the same time, in the same year, Schwarzschild, not Einstein, said there were things like

32:46.800 --> 32:47.920
 called black holes.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.920
 So it's interesting that that came the same.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.440
 So what year was that?

32:51.440 --> 32:53.440
 1915.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.520
 It was in parallel.

32:55.520 --> 33:00.880
 I should probably know this, but did Einstein not have any intuition that there should be

33:00.880 --> 33:02.400
 such things as black holes?

33:02.400 --> 33:04.080
 That came from Schwarzschild.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.280
 Oh, interesting.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.240
 Yeah.

33:06.240 --> 33:13.600
 So Schwarzschild, who was a German theoretical physicist, he got killed in the war, I think,

33:13.600 --> 33:17.600
 in the First World War, two years later or so.

33:17.600 --> 33:21.120
 He's the one that proposed black holes, that there were black holes.

33:21.120 --> 33:25.120
 It feels like a natural conclusion of general relativity, no?

33:25.120 --> 33:27.120
 Or is that not?

33:27.120 --> 33:31.040
 Well, it may seem like it, but I don't know about a natural conclusion.

33:31.040 --> 33:35.120
 It's a result of curved space time, though.

33:35.120 --> 33:41.280
 Right, but it's such a weird result that you might have to, it's a special case.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.280
 Yeah.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.280
 It's a special case.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.280
 Yeah.

33:44.280 --> 33:51.520
 So, I don't know, anyway, Einstein then, an interesting part of the story, is that Einstein

33:51.520 --> 33:53.120
 then left the problem.

33:53.120 --> 33:59.400
 Most physicists, because it really wasn't derived, he just made this, didn't pick up

33:59.400 --> 34:06.120
 on it, or general relativity much, because quantum mechanics became the thing in physics.

34:06.120 --> 34:12.720
 And Einstein only picked up this problem again after he immigrated to the US.

34:12.720 --> 34:15.880
 So he came to the US in 1932.

34:15.880 --> 34:22.400
 And I think in 1934 or five, he was working with another physicist called Rosen, who he

34:22.400 --> 34:27.160
 did several important works with, and they revisited the question.

34:27.160 --> 34:34.800
 And they had a problem that most of us as students always had that studied general relativity.

34:34.800 --> 34:39.720
 General relativity is really hard, because it's four dimensional instead of three dimensional.

34:39.720 --> 34:44.800
 And if you don't set it up right, you get infinities, which don't belong there.

34:44.800 --> 34:49.040
 We call them coordinate singularities as a name.

34:49.040 --> 34:52.440
 But if you get these infinities, you don't get the answers you want.

34:52.440 --> 35:01.240
 And he was trying to derive now general relativity from general relativity gravitational waves.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.600
 And in doing it, he kept getting these infinities.

35:04.600 --> 35:11.400
 And so he wrote a paper with Rosen that he submitted to our most important journal, Physical

35:11.400 --> 35:13.560
 Review Letters.

35:13.560 --> 35:20.440
 And that when it was submitted to Physical Review Letters, it was entitled, Do Gravitational

35:20.440 --> 35:26.680
 Waves Exist, a very funny title to write 20 years after he proposed they exist.

35:26.680 --> 35:32.080
 But it's because he had found these singularities, these infinities.

35:32.080 --> 35:42.120
 And so the editor at that time, and part of it that I don't know, is peer review.

35:42.120 --> 35:46.160
 We live and die by peer review as scientists and send our stuff out.

35:46.160 --> 35:53.160
 We don't know when peer review actually started or what peer review Einstein ever experienced

35:53.160 --> 35:54.360
 before this time.

35:54.360 --> 35:58.960
 But the editor of Physical Review sent this out for review.

35:58.960 --> 35:59.960
 He had a choice.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.240
 He could take any article and just accept it.

36:02.240 --> 36:05.520
 He could reject it or he could send it for review.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.520
 Right.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.640
 I believe the editors used to have much more power.

36:08.640 --> 36:09.640
 Yeah.

36:09.640 --> 36:10.640
 Yeah.

36:10.640 --> 36:11.640
 And he was a young man.

36:11.640 --> 36:12.640
 His name was Tate.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.440
 And he ended up being editor for years.

36:14.440 --> 36:23.120
 But so he sent this for review to a theoretical physicist named Robertson, who was also in

36:23.120 --> 36:28.800
 this field of general relativity, who happened to be on sabbatical at that moment at Caltech.

36:28.800 --> 36:34.160
 Otherwise, his institution was Princeton, where Einstein was.

36:34.160 --> 36:41.920
 And he saw that the way they set up the problem, the infinities were like I make it as a student.

36:41.920 --> 36:46.960
 Because if you don't set it up right in general relativity, you get these infinities.

36:46.960 --> 36:52.200
 And so he reviewed the article and gave an illustration that if they set it up in what

36:52.200 --> 36:57.640
 are called cylindrical coordinates, these infinities went away.

36:57.640 --> 37:03.480
 The editor of Physical Review was obviously intimidated by Einstein.

37:03.480 --> 37:08.320
 He wrote this really not a letter back like I would get saying, you're screwed up in

37:08.320 --> 37:09.320
 your paper.

37:09.320 --> 37:17.080
 And it was kind of, what do you think of the comments of our referee?

37:17.080 --> 37:22.760
 Einstein wrote back, it's a well documented letter, wrote back a letter to Physical Review

37:22.760 --> 37:28.760
 saying, I didn't send you the paper to send it to one of your so called experts, I sent

37:28.760 --> 37:31.000
 it to you to publish.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.360
 I withdraw the paper.

37:34.360 --> 37:37.480
 And he never published again in that journal.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.480
 That was 1936.

37:38.480 --> 37:47.640
 Instead, he rewrote it with the fixes that were made, changed the title and published

37:47.640 --> 37:55.240
 it in what was called the Franklin Review, which is the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia,

37:55.240 --> 38:00.160
 which is Benjamin Franklin Institute, which doesn't have a journal now, but did at that

38:00.160 --> 38:01.160
 time.

38:01.160 --> 38:02.160
 So the article is published.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.800
 It's the last time he ever wrote about it.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.880
 It remained controversial.

38:06.880 --> 38:17.120
 So it wasn't until close to 1960, 1958, where there was a conference that brought together

38:17.120 --> 38:28.080
 the experts in general relativity to try to sort out whether it was true that there were

38:28.080 --> 38:30.560
 gravitational waves or not.

38:30.560 --> 38:40.240
 And there was a very nice derivation by a British theorist from the heart of the theory

38:40.240 --> 38:43.800
 that gets gravitational waves.

38:43.800 --> 38:44.800
 And that was number one.

38:44.800 --> 38:49.280
 The second thing that happened at that meeting is Richard Feynman was there.

38:49.280 --> 38:55.000
 And Feynman said, well, if there's a typical Feynman, if there's gravitational waves,

38:55.000 --> 38:58.800
 they need to be able to do something, otherwise they don't exist.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.640
 So they have to be able to transfer energy.

39:00.640 --> 39:07.360
 So he made an idea of a Gadankan experiment that is just a bar with a couple of rings

39:07.360 --> 39:08.640
 on it.

39:08.640 --> 39:13.880
 And then if a gravitational wave goes through, it distorts the bar.

39:13.880 --> 39:17.480
 And that creates friction on these little rings.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.480
 And that's heat.

39:18.480 --> 39:19.480
 And that's energy.

39:19.480 --> 39:20.480
 So that meant...

39:20.480 --> 39:21.480
 Is that a good idea?

39:21.480 --> 39:22.880
 That sounds like a good idea.

39:22.880 --> 39:23.880
 Yeah.

39:23.880 --> 39:30.120
 But he showed that with the distortion of space time, you could transfer energy just

39:30.120 --> 39:32.040
 by this little idea.

39:32.040 --> 39:33.680
 And it was shown theoretically.

39:33.680 --> 39:42.000
 So at that point, it was believed theoretically then by people that gravitational waves should

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
 exist.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.600
 No, we should be able to detect them.

39:45.600 --> 39:50.720
 We should be able to detect them, except that they're very, very small.

39:50.720 --> 39:57.600
 So there's a bunch of questions here, but what kind of events would generate gravitational

39:57.600 --> 39:58.600
 waves?

39:58.600 --> 40:01.480
 You have to have this what I call quadrupole moment.

40:01.480 --> 40:08.600
 That comes about if I have, for example, two objects that go around each other like this,

40:08.600 --> 40:13.360
 like the earth around the sun or the moon around the earth.

40:13.360 --> 40:17.320
 Or in our case, it turns out to be two black holes going around each other like this.

40:17.320 --> 40:20.840
 So how's that different than basic oscillation back and forth?

40:20.840 --> 40:22.800
 Is it just more common in nature to have...

40:22.800 --> 40:24.160
 Oscillation is a dipole moment.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.800
 So it has to be in three dimensional space kind of oscillation.

40:26.800 --> 40:31.120
 So you have to have something that's three dimensional that'll give what I call a quadrupole

40:31.120 --> 40:32.120
 moment.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.200
 That's just built into this.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.520
 And luckily in nature, you have stuff out.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.600
 And luckily things exist.

40:37.600 --> 40:42.560
 And it is luckily because the effect is so small that you could say, look, I can take

40:42.560 --> 40:49.160
 a barbell and spin it and detect the gravitational waves.

40:49.160 --> 40:57.000
 But unfortunately, no matter how fast I spin it, so I know how to make gravitational waves,

40:57.000 --> 40:58.800
 but they're so weak, I can't detect them.

40:58.800 --> 41:02.040
 So we have to take something that's stronger than I can make.

41:02.040 --> 41:06.720
 Otherwise, we would do what Hertz did for electromagnetic waves, go in our lab, take

41:06.720 --> 41:09.000
 a barbell, put it on something, spin it.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.200
 Can I ask a dumb question?

41:10.200 --> 41:15.760
 So a single object that's weirdly shaped, does that generate gravitational waves?

41:15.760 --> 41:17.920
 So if it's rotating?

41:17.920 --> 41:18.920
 Sure.

41:18.920 --> 41:22.440
 But it's just much weaker signal.

41:22.440 --> 41:23.440
 It's weaker.

41:23.440 --> 41:27.920
 Well, we didn't know what the strongest signal would be that we would see.

41:27.920 --> 41:31.960
 We targeted seeing something called neutron stars, actually, because black holes we don't

41:31.960 --> 41:33.040
 know very much about.

41:33.040 --> 41:37.520
 It turned out we were a little bit lucky there was a stronger source, which was the black

41:37.520 --> 41:38.520
 holes.

41:38.520 --> 41:39.920
 Well, another ridiculous question.

41:39.920 --> 41:46.480
 So you say waves, what does a wave mean?

41:46.480 --> 41:52.920
 The most ridiculous version of that question is, what does it feel like to ride a wave

41:52.920 --> 41:58.080
 as you get closer to the source or experience it?

41:58.080 --> 42:02.280
 Well, if you experience a wave, imagine that this is what happens to you.

42:02.280 --> 42:06.360
 I don't know what you mean about getting close, it comes to you.

42:06.360 --> 42:10.480
 So it's like this light wave or something that comes through you.

42:10.480 --> 42:14.840
 So when the light hits you, it makes your eyes detected.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.360
 I flashed it.

42:16.360 --> 42:18.160
 What does this do?

42:18.160 --> 42:22.520
 It's like going to the amusement park, and they have these mirrors.

42:22.520 --> 42:25.960
 You look in this mirror and you look short and fat, and the one next to you makes you

42:25.960 --> 42:28.680
 tall and thin.

42:28.680 --> 42:33.720
 Imagine that you went back and forth between those two mirrors once a second.

42:33.720 --> 42:37.800
 That would be a gravitational wave with a period of once a second.

42:37.800 --> 42:42.680
 If you did it 60 times a second, go back and forth, and then that's all that happens.

42:42.680 --> 42:48.120
 It makes you taller and shorter and fatter back and forth as it goes through you at the

42:48.120 --> 42:50.400
 frequency of the gravitational wave.

42:50.400 --> 42:57.400
 So the frequencies that we detect are higher than one a second, but that's the idea.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.760
 And the amount is small.

42:59.760 --> 43:08.440
 Not the small, but if you're closer to the source of the wave, is it the same amount?

43:08.440 --> 43:10.920
 Yeah, it doesn't dissipate.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.440
 It doesn't dissipate.

43:12.440 --> 43:16.040
 Okay, so it's not that fun of an amusement ride.

43:16.040 --> 43:22.760
 Well, it does dissipate, but it's proportional to the distance.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.600
 It's not a big power, or something.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.600
 Gotcha.

43:26.600 --> 43:31.880
 But it would be a fun ride if you get a little bit closer, or a lot closer.

43:31.880 --> 43:38.360
 I wonder what the, okay, this is a ridiculous question, but I have you here.

43:38.360 --> 43:45.280
 Like the getting fatter and taller, I mean, that experience, for some reason that's mind

43:45.280 --> 43:50.920
 blowing to me, because it brings the distortion of space time to you.

43:50.920 --> 43:55.640
 I mean, space time is being morphed, right?

43:55.640 --> 44:00.040
 This is a wave that's so weird.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.040
 And we're in space.

44:01.040 --> 44:04.840
 Yeah, we're in space, and now it's moving.

44:04.840 --> 44:08.720
 I don't know what to do with the, I mean, does it, okay.

44:08.720 --> 44:14.840
 How much do you think about the philosophical implications of general relativity?

44:14.840 --> 44:21.520
 Like that we're in space time, and it can be bent by gravity.

44:21.520 --> 44:24.080
 Like, is that just what it is?

44:24.080 --> 44:26.560
 Are we supposed to be okay with this?

44:26.560 --> 44:29.720
 Because Newton, even Newton is a little weird, right?

44:29.720 --> 44:31.480
 But that at least makes sense.

44:31.480 --> 44:36.080
 That's our physical world, you know, when an apple falls, it makes sense.

44:36.080 --> 44:46.920
 But like the fact that entirety of the space time we're in can bend, that's really mind

44:46.920 --> 44:47.920
 blowing.

44:47.920 --> 44:49.600
 Well, let me make another analogy.

44:49.600 --> 44:51.600
 This is a therapy session for me at this point.

44:51.600 --> 44:53.160
 Yeah, right, another analogy.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.160
 Thank you.

44:54.160 --> 44:56.240
 So imagine you have a trampoline.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.240
 Yes.

44:57.240 --> 44:58.740
 Okay.

44:58.740 --> 45:01.000
 What happens if you put a marble on a trampoline?

45:01.000 --> 45:02.400
 Doesn't do anything, right?

45:02.400 --> 45:03.400
 No.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.720
 Maybe a little bit, but not much.

45:05.720 --> 45:06.720
 Yeah.

45:06.720 --> 45:09.440
 I mean, just if I drop it, it's not going to go anywhere.

45:09.440 --> 45:13.840
 Now imagine I put a bowling ball at the center of the trampoline.

45:13.840 --> 45:17.120
 Now I come up to the trampoline and I put a marble on.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.120
 What happens?

45:18.120 --> 45:21.360
 You know, roll towards the bowling ball.

45:21.360 --> 45:22.360
 Okay.

45:22.360 --> 45:29.280
 So what's happened is the presence of this massive object distorted the space that the

45:29.280 --> 45:30.880
 trampoline did.

45:30.880 --> 45:37.480
 This is the same thing that happens to the presence of the earth, the earth and the apple.

45:37.480 --> 45:42.920
 The presence of the earth affects the space around it just like the bowling ball on the

45:42.920 --> 45:43.920
 trampoline.

45:43.920 --> 45:44.920
 Yeah.

45:44.920 --> 45:45.920
 This doesn't make me feel better.

45:45.920 --> 45:53.440
 If I'm from the perspective of an ant walking around on that trampoline, then some guy just

45:53.440 --> 45:56.680
 dropped a ball and not only dropped a ball, right?

45:56.680 --> 45:59.160
 It's not just dropping a bowling ball.

45:59.160 --> 46:04.920
 It's making the ball go up and down or doing some kind of oscillation thing where it's

46:04.920 --> 46:06.640
 like waves.

46:06.640 --> 46:11.040
 And that's so fundamentally different from the experience on being on flat land and walking

46:11.040 --> 46:14.760
 around and just finding delicious sweet things as ant does.

46:14.760 --> 46:21.040
 And it just feels like to me from a human experience perspective, completely, it's humbling.

46:21.040 --> 46:23.040
 It's truly humbling.

46:23.040 --> 46:26.000
 It's humbling, but we see that kind of phenomenon all the time.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.520
 Let me give you another example.

46:29.520 --> 46:32.760
 Imagine that you walk up to a still pond.

46:32.760 --> 46:33.760
 Yes.

46:33.760 --> 46:34.760
 Okay.

46:34.760 --> 46:37.680
 Now I throw, you like to throw a rock in it.

46:37.680 --> 46:38.680
 What happens?

46:38.680 --> 46:44.600
 The rock goes in, sinks to the bottom, fine and these little ripples go out.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.960
 And they travel out.

46:46.960 --> 46:48.280
 That's exactly what happens.

46:48.280 --> 46:54.680
 I mean, there's a disturbance, which is the safe, the bowling ball or our black holes.

46:54.680 --> 47:00.160
 And then the ripples, they go out in the water, they're not, they don't have any, they don't

47:00.160 --> 47:02.600
 have the rock, any part, pieces of the rock.

47:02.600 --> 47:10.040
 The thing is, I guess, what's not disturbing about that is it's a, I mean, I guess a flat

47:10.040 --> 47:16.640
 two dimensional surface that's being disturbed, like for a three dimensional surface, a three

47:16.640 --> 47:20.040
 dimensional space to be disturbed feels weird.

47:20.040 --> 47:21.040
 It's even worse.

47:21.040 --> 47:25.040
 It's four dimensional because it's space and time.

47:25.040 --> 47:30.800
 So that's why you need Einstein is to make it four dimensional.

47:30.800 --> 47:31.800
 To make it four dimensional.

47:31.800 --> 47:32.800
 Yeah.

47:32.800 --> 47:38.400
 To take the same phenomenon and look at it in all of space and time.

47:38.400 --> 47:47.800
 Anyway, luckily for you and I and all of us, the amount of distortion is incredibly small.

47:47.800 --> 47:54.120
 So it turns out that if you think of space itself, now this is going to blow your mind

47:54.120 --> 47:55.120
 too.

47:55.120 --> 48:00.120
 If you think of space as being like a material, like this table, it's very stiff.

48:00.120 --> 48:03.880
 We have materials that are very pliable, materials that are very stiff.

48:03.880 --> 48:06.720
 So space itself is very stiff.

48:06.720 --> 48:10.680
 So when gravitational waves come through it, luckily for us, it doesn't distort it so

48:10.680 --> 48:15.240
 much that it affects our ordinary life very much.

48:15.240 --> 48:18.120
 No, I mean, that's great.

48:18.120 --> 48:19.120
 That's great.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.120
 I thought there was something bad coming.

48:20.120 --> 48:21.120
 No, this is great.

48:21.120 --> 48:22.120
 That's great news.

48:22.120 --> 48:29.240
 And so, I mean, that, I mean, perhaps we evolved as a life on earth to be such that for us,

48:29.240 --> 48:36.480
 this particular set of effects of gravitational waves is not that significant, maybe.

48:36.480 --> 48:37.480
 Maybe.

48:37.480 --> 48:38.480
 That's why.

48:38.480 --> 48:43.880
 You probably used this effect today or yesterday.

48:43.880 --> 48:45.880
 So it's pervasive.

48:45.880 --> 48:51.880
 Well, you mean gravity or the way, the external, because I only curvature of space and time.

48:51.880 --> 48:52.880
 Curvature of space.

48:52.880 --> 48:53.880
 How?

48:53.880 --> 48:55.800
 I only care personally as a human, right?

48:55.800 --> 48:56.800
 The gravity of earth.

48:56.800 --> 48:58.800
 But you use it every day almost.

48:58.800 --> 49:00.800
 Oh, it's curving.

49:00.800 --> 49:04.560
 No, no, no, it's in this thing.

49:04.560 --> 49:10.000
 Every time it tells you where you are, how does it tell you where you are?

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
 It tells you where you are because we have 24 satellites or some number that are going

49:14.000 --> 49:22.360
 around in space and it asks how long it takes the beam to go to the satellite and come back

49:22.360 --> 49:27.560
 the signal to different ones and then it triangulates and tells you where you are.

49:27.560 --> 49:30.160
 And then if you go down the road, it tells you where you are.

49:30.160 --> 49:35.000
 Do you know that if you did that with the satellites and you didn't use Einstein's equations?

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
 Oh, no.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.400
 You won't get the right answer.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.400
 That's right.

49:39.400 --> 49:44.800
 And in fact, if you take a road that's, say, 10 meters wide, I've done these numbers and

49:44.800 --> 49:50.320
 you ask how long you'd stay on the road if you didn't make the correction for general

49:50.320 --> 49:55.000
 relativity, this thing you're poo pooing, because you're using every day, you'd go off

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
 the road.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
 You'd go off the road.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
 Well, actually, that might be my problem.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
 So you use it.

49:59.000 --> 50:04.480
 Well, I think I'm using an Andreas and the GPS doesn't work that well, so maybe I'm

50:04.480 --> 50:09.360
 using Newton's physics, so I need to upgrade to general relativity.

50:09.360 --> 50:16.360
 So the gravitation waves in Einstein had, wait, Feynman really does have a part in the

50:16.360 --> 50:17.360
 story?

50:17.360 --> 50:18.360
 Yeah.

50:18.360 --> 50:22.240
 Was that one of the first kind of experimental proposed, the tech gravitation waves?

50:22.240 --> 50:24.640
 Well, he did what we call a Godonkin experiment.

50:24.640 --> 50:25.640
 That's a thought experiment.

50:25.640 --> 50:26.640
 Yes.

50:26.640 --> 50:27.640
 Okay.

50:27.640 --> 50:28.640
 Not a real experiment.

50:28.640 --> 50:32.960
 Well, after that, then people believe gravitation waves must exist.

50:32.960 --> 50:38.240
 You can kind of calculate how big they are, they're tiny, and so people started searching.

50:38.240 --> 50:44.440
 The first idea that was used was Feynman's idea, and then, oh, very end of it, and it

50:44.440 --> 50:51.680
 was to take a great big, huge bar of aluminum and then put around, and it's made like a

50:51.680 --> 50:58.080
 cylinder and then put around it some very, very sensitive detectors so that if a gravitational

50:58.080 --> 51:04.360
 wave happened to go through it, it would go, and you detect this extra strain that was

51:04.360 --> 51:05.360
 there.

51:05.360 --> 51:09.440
 And that was this method that was used until we came along.

51:09.440 --> 51:12.400
 It wasn't a very good method to use.

51:12.400 --> 51:17.000
 And what was the, so we're talking about a pretty weak signal here.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.480
 Yeah, that's why that method didn't work.

51:19.480 --> 51:26.720
 So what, can you tell the story of figuring out what kind of method would be able to detect

51:26.720 --> 51:30.280
 this very weak signal of gravitational waves?

51:30.280 --> 51:37.400
 So remembering the, remembering what happens when you go to the amusement park, that it's

51:37.400 --> 51:43.520
 going to do something like stretch this way and squash that way, squash this way and stretch

51:43.520 --> 51:44.520
 this way.

51:44.520 --> 51:48.000
 We do have an instrument that can detect that kind of thing.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.160
 It's called an interferometer.

51:51.160 --> 51:58.760
 And what it does is it just basically takes usually light and the two directions that

51:58.760 --> 52:04.560
 we're talking about, you send light down one direction and the perpendicular direction.

52:04.560 --> 52:10.000
 And if nothing changes, it takes the same, and the arms are the same length.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.480
 It just goes down, bounces back.

52:13.480 --> 52:16.120
 And if you invert one compared to the other, they cancel.

52:16.120 --> 52:18.040
 So there's nothing happens.

52:18.040 --> 52:23.640
 But if it's like the amusement park and one of the arms got shorter and fatter.

52:23.640 --> 52:27.800
 So it took longer to go horizontally than it did to go vertically.

52:27.800 --> 52:34.680
 Then when they come back, when the light comes back, that comes back somewhat out of time.

52:34.680 --> 52:37.040
 And that basically is the scheme.

52:37.040 --> 52:43.480
 The only problem is that that's not done very accurately in general.

52:43.480 --> 52:46.000
 And we had to do it extremely accurately.

52:46.000 --> 52:52.000
 So what's the difficulty of doing so accurately?

52:52.000 --> 52:53.320
 Okay.

52:53.320 --> 52:59.080
 So the measurement that we have to do is a distortion in time.

52:59.080 --> 53:01.000
 How big is it?

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
 It's a distortion.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.280
 That's one part in 10 to the 21.

53:04.280 --> 53:07.960
 That's 21 zeros and a one.

53:07.960 --> 53:08.960
 Okay.

53:08.960 --> 53:12.040
 So this is like a delay in the thing coming back?

53:12.040 --> 53:17.760
 It's one of them coming back after the other one, but the difference is just one part in

53:17.760 --> 53:20.560
 10 to the 21.

53:20.560 --> 53:23.760
 So for that reason, we make it big.

53:23.760 --> 53:25.160
 Let the arms be long.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.160
 Okay.

53:26.160 --> 53:28.920
 So one part in 10 to the 21.

53:28.920 --> 53:31.380
 In our case, it's kilometers long.

53:31.380 --> 53:35.120
 So we have an instruments of kilometers in one direction, kilometers in the other.

53:35.120 --> 53:36.120
 How many kilometers?

53:36.120 --> 53:37.640
 We're talking about four kilometers.

53:37.640 --> 53:41.440
 Four kilometers in each direction.

53:41.440 --> 53:46.960
 If you take then one part in 10 to the 21, we're talking about measuring something to

53:46.960 --> 53:52.280
 10 to the minus 18 meters.

53:52.280 --> 54:01.960
 Now, to tell you how small that is, the proton thing we're made of, which you can't go and

54:01.960 --> 54:05.720
 grab so easily, is 10 to the minus 15 meters.

54:05.720 --> 54:08.960
 So this is one 1,000th the size of a proton.

54:08.960 --> 54:12.240
 That's the size of the effect.

54:12.240 --> 54:17.160
 Einstein himself didn't think this could be measured, ever seen actually.

54:17.160 --> 54:18.880
 He said that.

54:18.880 --> 54:26.520
 But that's because he didn't anticipate modern lasers and techniques that we developed.

54:26.520 --> 54:28.280
 Okay.

54:28.280 --> 54:35.040
 So maybe can you tell me a little bit what you're referring to as LIGO, the laser interferometer

54:35.040 --> 54:37.920
 or gravitational wave observatory?

54:37.920 --> 54:39.640
 What is LIGO?

54:39.640 --> 54:43.460
 Can you just elaborate kind of the big picture view here before I ask you specific questions

54:43.460 --> 54:44.460
 about it?

54:44.460 --> 54:45.460
 Yeah.

54:45.460 --> 54:57.120
 So in the same idea that I just said, we have two long vacuum pipes, four kilometers long.

54:57.120 --> 55:03.320
 We start with a laser beam and we divide the beam going down the two arms and we have a

55:03.320 --> 55:06.680
 mirror at the other end, reflects it back.

55:06.680 --> 55:09.800
 It's more subtle, but we bring it back.

55:09.800 --> 55:14.320
 If there's no distortion in space time and the lengths are exactly the same, which we

55:14.320 --> 55:20.400
 calibrate them to be, then when it comes back, if we just invert one signal compared

55:20.400 --> 55:22.360
 to the other, they'll just cancel.

55:22.360 --> 55:23.920
 So we see nothing.

55:23.920 --> 55:25.120
 Okay.

55:25.120 --> 55:29.640
 But if one arm got a little bit longer than the other, then they don't come back at exactly

55:29.640 --> 55:30.640
 the same time.

55:30.640 --> 55:32.040
 They don't exactly cancel.

55:32.040 --> 55:34.800
 That's what we measure.

55:34.800 --> 55:42.560
 So to give a number to it, we have to do that to, we have the change of length to be able

55:42.560 --> 55:48.200
 to do this 10 to the minus 18 meters to one part in 10 to the 12th.

55:48.200 --> 55:55.680
 And that was the big experimental challenge that required a lot of innovation to be able

55:55.680 --> 55:57.680
 to do.

55:57.680 --> 56:01.640
 What you gave a lot of credit to, I think Caltech and MIT for some of the technical

56:01.640 --> 56:04.440
 developments like within this project.

56:04.440 --> 56:11.040
 Is there some interesting things you can speak to like at the low level of some cool stuff

56:11.040 --> 56:13.040
 that had to be solved?

56:13.040 --> 56:14.040
 What do we talk?

56:14.040 --> 56:15.240
 I'm a software engineer.

56:15.240 --> 56:19.840
 So all of this, I have so much more respect for everything done here than anything I've

56:19.840 --> 56:20.840
 ever done.

56:20.840 --> 56:22.760
 So it's just code.

56:22.760 --> 56:34.160
 So I'll give you an example of doing mechanical engineering at a basically mechanical

56:34.160 --> 56:39.120
 engineering and geology and maybe at a level.

56:39.120 --> 56:40.600
 So what do we, what's the problem?

56:40.600 --> 56:44.840
 The problem is the following that I've given you this picture of an instrument that by

56:44.840 --> 56:49.960
 some magic, I can make good enough to measure this very short distance.

56:49.960 --> 56:51.960
 But then I put it down here.

56:51.960 --> 56:52.960
 It won't work.

56:52.960 --> 56:58.140
 And the reason it doesn't work is that the earth itself is moving all over the place

56:58.140 --> 56:59.440
 all the time.

56:59.440 --> 57:04.000
 You don't realize that it seems pretty good to you, but it's moving all the time.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.400
 So somehow it's moving so much that we can't deal with it.

57:08.400 --> 57:13.040
 We happen to be trying to do the experiment here on earth, but we can't deal with it.

57:13.040 --> 57:17.720
 So we have to make the instrument isolated from the earth.

57:17.720 --> 57:19.000
 Oh no.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.640
 At the frequencies we're at, we've got to float it.

57:21.640 --> 57:24.880
 That's a mechanical, that's an engineering problem, not a physics problem.

57:24.880 --> 57:29.320
 So when you actually like we're doing, we're having a conversation on our podcast right

57:29.320 --> 57:34.240
 now, there's, and people who record music work with this, how to create an isolated

57:34.240 --> 57:40.960
 room and they usually build a room within a room, but that's still not isolated.

57:40.960 --> 57:44.960
 In fact, they say it's impossible to truly isolate from sound, from noise and stuff like

57:44.960 --> 57:46.040
 that.

57:46.040 --> 57:55.080
 But that's like one step of millions that you took as building a room inside a room.

57:55.080 --> 57:57.280
 You basically have to isolate all.

57:57.280 --> 57:59.000
 This is actually an easier problem.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.760
 You just have to do it really well.

58:00.760 --> 58:05.200
 So the making a clean room is really a tough problem because you have to put a room inside

58:05.200 --> 58:06.200
 a room.

58:06.200 --> 58:07.200
 Yeah.

58:07.200 --> 58:11.680
 So this is this is really simple engineering or physics.

58:11.680 --> 58:12.680
 Uh huh.

58:12.680 --> 58:13.680
 Okay.

58:13.680 --> 58:14.680
 So what do you have to do?

58:14.680 --> 58:16.520
 How do you isolate yourself from the, from the earth?

58:16.520 --> 58:17.520
 Yes.

58:17.520 --> 58:22.600
 First, we work at, we're not looking at all frequencies for gravitational waves.

58:22.600 --> 58:27.760
 We're looking at particular frequencies that you can deal with here on earth.

58:27.760 --> 58:30.360
 So what are frequencies with those be?

58:30.360 --> 58:32.200
 You were just talking about frequencies.

58:32.200 --> 58:34.160
 I mean, I don't know.

58:34.160 --> 58:38.240
 We know by evolution, our bodies know it's the audio band.

58:38.240 --> 58:39.640
 Okay.

58:39.640 --> 58:43.840
 The reason our ears work where they work is that's where the earth isn't going, making

58:43.840 --> 58:44.840
 too much noise.

58:44.840 --> 58:45.840
 Okay.

58:45.840 --> 58:49.800
 So the reason our ears work the way they work is because this is where it's quiet.

58:49.800 --> 58:51.040
 That's right.

58:51.040 --> 58:58.960
 So if you go to, if you go to one Hertz instead of 10 Hertz, it's the earth is really moving

58:58.960 --> 58:59.960
 around.

58:59.960 --> 59:05.840
 So, so somehow we live in a, what we call the audio band, it's tens of Hertz to thousands

59:05.840 --> 59:06.840
 of Hertz.

59:06.840 --> 59:08.320
 That's where we live.

59:08.320 --> 59:09.320
 That's where we live.

59:09.320 --> 59:10.320
 Okay.

59:10.320 --> 59:13.920
 If we're going to do an experiment on the earth, it might as well do it.

59:13.920 --> 59:15.000
 It's the same frequency.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.520
 That's where the earth is the quietest.

59:16.520 --> 59:18.160
 So we have to work in that frequency.

59:18.160 --> 59:21.360
 So we're not looking at all frequencies, okay?

59:21.360 --> 59:28.760
 So the solution for the, for the shaking of the earth to get rid of it is pretty mundane.

59:28.760 --> 59:35.740
 If we do the same thing that you do to make your car drive smoothly down the road.

59:35.740 --> 59:39.080
 So what happens when your car goes over a bump?

59:39.080 --> 59:40.080
 Early cars did that.

59:40.080 --> 59:41.080
 They bounced.

59:41.080 --> 59:42.080
 Right.

59:42.080 --> 59:43.080
 Okay.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.840
 But you don't feel that in your car.

59:44.840 --> 59:46.480
 So what happened to that energy?

59:46.480 --> 59:48.360
 You can't just disappear energy.

59:48.360 --> 59:51.720
 So we have these things called shock absorbers in the car.

59:51.720 --> 59:57.600
 What they do is they absorb, they take the, the thing that went like that and they basically

59:57.600 --> 1:00:02.120
 can't get rid of the energy, but they move it to very, very low frequency.

1:00:02.120 --> 1:00:07.480
 So what you feel isn't, you feel like, oh, smoothly.

1:00:07.480 --> 1:00:08.480
 Okay.

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:09.480
 All right.

1:00:09.480 --> 1:00:13.560
 So we also work at this frequency.

1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:19.320
 So if we, so we basically why, why do we have to do anything other than shock absorbers?

1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:25.480
 So we made the world's fanciest shock absorbers, okay?

1:00:25.480 --> 1:00:29.840
 Not just like in your car where there's one layer of them, they're just the right squishiness

1:00:29.840 --> 1:00:30.840
 and so forth.

1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:32.800
 They're better than what's in the cars.

1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:34.140
 And we have four layers of it.

1:00:34.140 --> 1:00:38.800
 So whatever shakes and gets through the first layer, we treat it in a second, third or fourth

1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:39.800
 layer.

1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:41.300
 So some mechanical engineering problem.

1:00:41.300 --> 1:00:42.300
 Yeah.

1:00:42.300 --> 1:00:47.440
 So there's not, there's no weird tricks to it, like a, like a chemistry type thing or

1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:48.440
 no, no.

1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:52.280
 Just while the right squishiness, you know, I need the right material inside and ours

1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:56.360
 looks like little springs, but they're springs.

1:00:56.360 --> 1:00:57.360
 There's springs.

1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:00.080
 So like legitimately like shock absorbers.

1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:01.080
 Yeah.

1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:02.080
 What?

1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:03.080
 Okay.

1:01:03.080 --> 1:01:04.320
 Okay.

1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:07.520
 And this is now experimental physics at the edits limit.

1:01:07.520 --> 1:01:08.520
 Okay.

1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:11.440
 So you do this and we make the world's fanciest shock absorbers.

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:13.680
 Just mechanical engineering.

1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:14.680
 Just mechanical engineering.

1:01:14.680 --> 1:01:16.040
 This is hilarious.

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:22.320
 But we didn't just, we weren't good enough to discover gravitational waves.

1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:30.200
 So, so we did another, we added another feature and it's something else that you're aware

1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:34.920
 of probably have one and that is to get rid of noise.

1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:40.080
 You've probably noise, which is, you don't like, and that's the same principle that's

1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:43.240
 in these little Bose earphones.

1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:44.640
 Noise canceling.

1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:45.640
 Noise canceling.

1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:48.200
 So, so how do they work?

1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:54.280
 They basically, you go on an airplane and they sense the ambient noise from the engines

1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:57.800
 and cancel it because it's just the same over and over again.

1:01:57.800 --> 1:01:59.280
 They cancel it.

1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:03.160
 And when the stewardess comes and asks you whether you want coffee or a tea or a drink

1:02:03.160 --> 1:02:06.520
 or something, you hear her fine because she's not ambient.

1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:07.520
 She's the signal.

1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:09.600
 So are we talking about active canceling?

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:10.600
 I think we're actually.

1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:11.600
 Active canceling.

1:02:11.600 --> 1:02:12.600
 So.

1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:13.600
 This is, okay.

1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:14.600
 So another.

1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:19.280
 Don't tell me you have active canceling on this besides the shock absorbers.

1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:20.280
 Yeah.

1:02:20.280 --> 1:02:21.280
 So we had this.

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:26.400
 So inside this array of shock absorbers, we, you asked for some interesting.

1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:28.000
 This is awesome.

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:33.640
 So inside this, it's harder than the, the earphone problem, but it's just engineering.

1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:41.320
 We have to see measure not just that the engine still made noise, but the earth is shaking.

1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:43.400
 It's moving in some direction.

1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:48.200
 So we have to actually tell not only that there's noise and cancel it, but what direction

1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:49.200
 it's from.

1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:57.080
 So we put this array of seismometers inside this array of shock absorbers and measure the

1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:05.360
 residual motion and its direction, and we put little actuators that push back against

1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:07.160
 it and cancel it.

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:10.320
 That's just awesome.

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:14.200
 So you have the actuators and you have the thing that is sensing the vibrations and

1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:18.600
 then you have the actual actuators that adjust for that and do so in perfect synchrony.

1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:19.600
 Yeah.

1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:21.200
 What if it all works right?

1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:25.120
 And so how much do we reduce the shaking of the earth?

1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:29.560
 I mean, one part in 10 to the 12th.

1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:37.000
 One part in 10, what gets through us is one part in 10 to the 12th.

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.960
 That's pretty big reduction.

1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:41.320
 You don't need that in your car, but that's what we do.

1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:43.480
 And so that's how isolated we are from the earth.

1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:49.240
 And that was the biggest, I'd say, technical problem outside of the physics instrument,

1:03:49.240 --> 1:03:50.240
 the interferometer.

1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:53.080
 Can I ask you a weird question here?

1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:57.760
 We make it very poetically and humorously, just saying it's just a mechanical engineering

1:03:57.760 --> 1:03:59.080
 problem.

1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:07.080
 But is this one of the biggest precision mechanical engineering efforts ever?

1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:09.960
 I mean, this seems exceptionally difficult.

1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:10.960
 It is.

1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:17.200
 And so it took a long time, and I think nobody seems to challenge the statement that this

1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:22.760
 is the most precision, precise instrument that's ever been built, LIGO.

1:04:22.760 --> 1:04:27.200
 I wonder what listening to Led Zeppelin sounds on this thing, because it's so isolated.

1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:30.280
 I mean, this is like, I don't know.

1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:31.280
 No background.

1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:32.280
 No background.

1:04:32.280 --> 1:04:33.280
 Wow.

1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:34.280
 Wow.

1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:35.280
 Wow.

1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:44.480
 So when you were first conceiving this, I would probably, if I was knowledgeable enough,

1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:48.200
 kind of laugh off the possibility that this is even possible.

1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:53.280
 I'm sure, like, how many people believe that this is possible?

1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:54.920
 Did you believe this is possible?

1:04:54.920 --> 1:04:57.200
 I did.

1:04:57.200 --> 1:04:59.840
 I didn't know that we needed, for sure, that we needed active.

1:04:59.840 --> 1:05:07.040
 When we started, we did just passive, but we were doing the tests to develop the active

1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:11.360
 to add as a second stage, which we ended up needing.

1:05:11.360 --> 1:05:17.200
 But there was a lot of, you know, now there was a lot of skepticism, a lot of us, especially

1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:23.440
 astronomers, felt that money was being wasted, as we were also expensive doing what I told

1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:24.640
 you is not cheap.

1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:30.000
 So it was kind of controversial, it was funded by the National Science Foundation.

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:39.600
 Can you just link on this just for a little longer, the actuator thing, the active cancelling?

1:05:39.600 --> 1:05:45.200
 Do you remember, like, little experiments that were done along the way to prove to the team

1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:47.920
 themselves that this is even possible?

1:05:47.920 --> 1:05:52.760
 So from our, because I work with quite a bit of robots, and to me, the idea that you could

1:05:52.760 --> 1:06:01.440
 do it this precisely is a humbling and embarrassing, frankly, because, like, this is another level

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:07.680
 of precision that I can't even, because robots are a mess.

1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:14.440
 And this is basically one of the most precise robots ever, right?

1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:19.000
 So like, can you, is there, do you have any, like, small scale experiments that were done

1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:20.960
 that just, you know, this is possible?

1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:21.960
 Yeah.

1:06:21.960 --> 1:06:22.960
 And larger scale.

1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:29.560
 We made, we made a test, that also has to be in vacuum tube, but we made test chambers

1:06:29.560 --> 1:06:38.480
 that had this system in it, our first mock of this system, so we could test it and optimize

1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:40.240
 it and make it work.

1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:42.320
 But it's just a mechanical engineering problem.

1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:49.800
 Okay, humans are just ape descendants, I got you, I got you.

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:57.080
 Is there any video of this, like, some kind of educational purpose visualizations of this

1:06:57.080 --> 1:06:58.080
 active cancelling?

1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:04.560
 I don't think so, I mean, does this live on?

1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:11.000
 Well, we work, for parts of it, for the active cancelling, we worked with, for the instruments,

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:17.760
 for the sensor and instruments, we worked with a small company near where you are, because

1:07:17.760 --> 1:07:23.040
 it was RMIT people that got them that were, you know, interested in the problem because

1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:29.400
 they thought they might be able to commercialize it for making stable tables to make microelectronics,

1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:33.840
 for example, which are limited by how stable the table is.

1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:37.160
 At this point, it's a little expensive.

1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:38.160
 You never know.

1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:40.160
 You never know where this leads.

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:48.960
 So, maybe on the, let me ask you, just sticking it a little longer, this silly old mechanical

1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:57.840
 engineering problem, what was, to you, kind of the darkest moment of what was the hardest

1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:01.440
 stumbling block to get over on the engineer side?

1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:04.440
 Was there any time where there was a doubt, where it's like, I'm not sure we would be

1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:08.800
 able to do this, a kind of engineering challenge that was hit?

1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:09.800
 Do you remember?

1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:20.640
 I think, though, one that my colleague at MIT, Ray Weiss, worked on so hard and was much

1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:21.920
 more of a worry than this.

1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:22.920
 This is only a question.

1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:28.320
 If you do not do it well enough, you have to keep making it better somehow.

1:08:28.320 --> 1:08:33.560
 But this whole huge instrument has to be in vacuum.

1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:38.240
 And the vacuum tanks are, you know, this big around.

1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:41.720
 And so, it's the world's biggest high vacuum system.

1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:49.520
 And how do you make it, first of all, how do you make this four meter long sealed vacuum

1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:50.520
 system?

1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:51.520
 It has to be made out of...

1:08:51.520 --> 1:08:52.520
 Four kilometers long.

1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:54.360
 Four kilometers long, would I say something else?

1:08:54.360 --> 1:08:55.360
 Meters.

1:08:55.360 --> 1:08:56.360
 Four kilometers long.

1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:57.360
 Big difference.

1:08:57.360 --> 1:08:58.360
 Yeah.

1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:07.040
 And so, but to make it, yeah, we started with a roll of stainless steel and then we roll

1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:11.240
 it out like a spiral so that there's a spiral weld on it.

1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:12.240
 Okay.

1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:14.160
 So, the engineering was fine.

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:15.160
 We did that.

1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:19.200
 We worked through very good companies and so forth to build it.

1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:26.560
 But the big worry was, what if you develop a leak?

1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:30.280
 This is a high vacuum, not just vacuum system.

1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:38.520
 And in a laboratory, if there's a leak, you put helium around the thing you have and then

1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:41.120
 you detect where the helium is coming in.

1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:44.600
 But if you have something as big as this, you can't surround it with helium.

1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:48.400
 So you might not actually even know that there's a leak and it will be affecting...

1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:54.960
 Well, we can measure how good the vacuum is so we can know that.

1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:58.280
 But there are leak and develop and then we don't...

1:09:58.280 --> 1:09:59.280
 How do we fix it?

1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:01.200
 How do we find it?

1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:02.720
 And so that was...

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:03.720
 You asked about a worry.

1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:06.600
 That was always a really big worry.

1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:10.400
 What's the difference between a high vacuum and a vacuum?

1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:11.400
 What is high vacuum?

1:10:11.400 --> 1:10:15.480
 That's like some delta of close to vacuum.

1:10:15.480 --> 1:10:16.480
 Is there some threshold?

1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:18.720
 Well, there's a unit.

1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:24.520
 High vacuum is when the vacuum and the units that are used which are torsors, 10 to the

1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:27.280
 minus 9.

1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:31.320
 And high vacuum is usually used in small places.

1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:38.400
 The biggest vacuum system period is at CERN in this big particle accelerator.

1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:42.800
 But the high vacuum where they need really good vacuum so particles don't scatter and

1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:43.960
 is smaller than ours.

1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:48.640
 So ours is a really large high vacuum system.

1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:49.640
 I don't know.

1:10:49.640 --> 1:10:50.640
 This is so cool.

1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:57.280
 I mean, this is basically by far the greatest listening device ever built by humans.

1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:01.040
 The fact that descendants of apes could do this.

1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:04.880
 That evolution started with single cell organisms.

1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:05.960
 Is there any more...

1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:09.160
 I'm a huge theorist, yeah, yeah.

1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:13.600
 But like bridges, when I look at bridges from a civil engineering perspective is one of

1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:15.640
 the most beautiful creations by human beings.

1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:22.040
 With physics, you're using physics to construct objects that can support huge amount of mass.

1:11:22.040 --> 1:11:25.760
 And it's like structural, but it's also beautiful and that humans can collaborate to create

1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:27.560
 that throughout history.

1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:30.760
 And then you take this on another level.

1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:39.120
 This is like exciting to me beyond measure that humans can create something so precise.

1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:44.920
 But another concept lost in this, you just said you started talking about single cell.

1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:45.920
 Okay.

1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:50.640
 You have to realize this discovery that we made that everybody's bought off on happened

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:58.320
 1.3 billion years ago, somewhere, and then the signal came to us 1.3 billion years ago,

1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:03.660
 we were just converting on the earth from single cell to multi cell life.

1:12:03.660 --> 1:12:09.120
 So when this actually happened, this collision of two black holes, we weren't here.

1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:11.120
 We weren't even close to being here.

1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:12.120
 We're both developing slowly.

1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:16.960
 Well, yeah, we were going from single cell to multi cell life at that point.

1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:18.960
 All to meet up at this point.

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:19.960
 Yeah.

1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:20.960
 Wow.

1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:22.960
 That's almost romantic.

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:23.960
 It is.

1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:24.960
 Okay.

1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:34.720
 So on the human side of things, it's kind of fascinating because you're talking about

1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:45.080
 a over a thousand people team for LIGO that started out with around 100, and you for parts

1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:49.080
 of the time at least led this team.

1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:56.880
 What does it take to lead a team like this of incredibly brilliant theoreticians and engineers

1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:02.960
 and just a lot of different parties involved, a lot of egos, a lot of ideas.

1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:09.200
 You had this funny example, I forget where, where in publishing a paper, you have to all

1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:15.640
 agree on the phrasing of a certain sentence or the title of the paper and so on.

1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:17.240
 That's a very interesting, simple example.

1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:22.160
 I'd love you to speak to that, but just in general, what does it take to lead this kind

1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:23.160
 of team?

1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:24.160
 Okay.

1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:29.560
 I think the general idea is one we all know.

1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:36.920
 You want to, you want to, you want to get where the, the sum of something is more than

1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:40.680
 the individual parts is what we say, right?

1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:42.240
 So that's what you're trying to achieve.

1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:43.240
 Yes.

1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:44.240
 Okay.

1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:45.240
 How do you do that actually?

1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:50.480
 Mostly if we take multiple objects or people, I mean, you put them together, the sum is

1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:51.480
 less.

1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:52.480
 Yes.

1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:53.480
 Why?

1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:54.480
 Because they overlap.

1:13:54.480 --> 1:14:00.280
 So you don't have individual things that, you know, this person does that, this person

1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:03.520
 does that, then you get exactly the sum.

1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:09.280
 But what you want is to develop where you get more than what the individual contributions

1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:10.280
 are.

1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:11.280
 We know that's very common.

1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:13.360
 People use that expression everywhere.

1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:19.740
 And it's the expression that has to be kind of built into how people feel it's working.

1:14:19.740 --> 1:14:26.800
 Because if you're part of a team and you realize that somehow the team is able to do more than

1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:32.720
 the individuals could do themselves, then they buy on kind of in terms of the process.

1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:39.440
 So that's the, that's the goal that you have to have is to, to achieve that.

1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:49.720
 And that means that you have to realize parts of what you're trying to do that require

1:14:49.720 --> 1:14:51.840
 not, that one person couldn't do it.

1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:56.920
 It requires the combined talents to be able to do something that neither of them could

1:14:56.920 --> 1:14:58.320
 do themselves.

1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:00.080
 And we have a lot of that kind of thing.

1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:05.640
 And I think, I mean, build into the, some of the examples that I gave you.

1:15:05.640 --> 1:15:13.680
 And so how do you then, so, so the key almost in anything you do is the people themselves,

1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:14.680
 right?

1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:22.520
 In our case, the first and most important was to attract, to spend years of their life

1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:27.120
 on this, the best possible people in the world to do it.

1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:34.600
 So the only way to convince them is that somehow it's better and more interesting for them

1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:37.160
 than what they could do themselves.

1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:40.360
 And so that's part of this idea.

1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:41.360
 I got you.

1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:42.360
 Yeah.

1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:43.360
 That's powerful.

1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:46.200
 If there's best people in the world, there's egos.

1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:48.640
 Is there something to be said about managing egos?

1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:52.040
 Well, that's the human problem is always the hardest.

1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:56.120
 And so there's, that's an art, not a science, I think.

1:15:56.120 --> 1:16:05.440
 I think the fact here that combined, there's a, was a romantic goal that we had to do something

1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:16.640
 that people hadn't done before, which was important scientifically and, and a huge challenge

1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:22.160
 enabled us to say take and get, I mean, what we did just to take an example, we use the

1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:26.200
 light to go in this thing comes from lasers.

1:16:26.200 --> 1:16:27.760
 We need a certain kind of laser.

1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:35.800
 So the kind of laser that we use, there were three different institutions in the world

1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:40.240
 that had the experts that do this, maybe in competition with each other.

1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:46.320
 So we got all three to join together and work with us to work on this as an example.

1:16:46.320 --> 1:16:53.240
 So that you had, and they had the thing that they were working together on a kind of object

1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:58.600
 that they wouldn't have otherwise, and we're part of a bigger team where they could discover

1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:01.160
 something that isn't even engineers.

1:17:01.160 --> 1:17:02.760
 These are engineers that do lasers.

1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:06.280
 So, and they're part of our laser physicists.

1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:16.320
 And so could you describe the moment or the period of time when finally this incredible

1:17:16.320 --> 1:17:20.960
 creation of human beings led to a detection of gravitational waves?

1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:27.000
 It's a long story, unfortunately, this is a part that we started failures along the

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:31.920
 way kind of thing or all failures, that's all that's built into it.

1:17:31.920 --> 1:17:38.440
 If you're not, if you're not mechanical engineering, you build on your failures, that's expected.

1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:40.760
 So we're trying things that no one's done before.

1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:43.600
 So it's technically not just gravitational waves.

1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:46.400
 And so it's built on failures.

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:54.840
 But anyway, we did before me, even the people did R&D on the concepts.

1:17:54.840 --> 1:18:02.880
 But starting in 1994, we got money from the National Science Foundation to build this thing.

1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:04.920
 It took about five years to build it.

1:18:04.920 --> 1:18:10.880
 So by 1999, we had built the basic unit.

1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:16.320
 It did not have active seismic isolation at that stage, didn't have some other things

1:18:16.320 --> 1:18:18.480
 that we have now.

1:18:18.480 --> 1:18:31.200
 What we did at the beginning was stick to technologies that we had at least enough knowledge that

1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:35.200
 we could make work or had tested in our own laboratories.

1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:37.920
 And so then we put together the instrument.

1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:44.080
 We made it work, it didn't work very well, but it worked, and we didn't see any gravitational

1:18:44.080 --> 1:18:45.080
 waves.

1:18:45.080 --> 1:18:50.880
 Then we figured out what limited us, and we went through this every year for almost 10

1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:54.200
 years, never seeing gravitational waves.

1:18:54.200 --> 1:19:02.600
 We would run it, looking for gravitational waves for months, learn what limited us, fix

1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:05.800
 it for months, and then run it again.

1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:12.680
 Actually we knew we had to take another big step, and that's when we made several changes,

1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:19.680
 including adding these active seismic isolation, which turned out to be a key.

1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:26.520
 And we fortunately got the National Science Foundation to give us another couple hundred

1:19:26.520 --> 1:19:35.080
 million dollars, 100 million more, and we rebuilt it, or improved it.

1:19:35.080 --> 1:19:50.640
 And then in 2015, we turned it on, and we almost instantly saw this first collision

1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:55.360
 of two black holes.

1:19:55.360 --> 1:20:00.120
 And then we went through a process of, do we believe what we've seen?

1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:02.960
 Yeah, I think you're one of the people that went through that process.

1:20:02.960 --> 1:20:07.440
 It sounds like some people immediately believed it, and then you were like...

1:20:07.440 --> 1:20:12.200
 So as human beings, we all have different reactions to almost anything, and so quite

1:20:12.200 --> 1:20:15.480
 a few of my colleagues had a Eureka moment immediately.

1:20:15.480 --> 1:20:25.680
 I mean, it's the figure that we put in our paper first is just data.

1:20:25.680 --> 1:20:32.320
 We didn't have to go through fancy computer programs to do anything, and we showed next

1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:39.520
 to it the calculations of Einstein's equations, and it looks just like what we detected.

1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:42.840
 And we did it in two different detectors halfway across the US.

1:20:42.840 --> 1:20:49.920
 So it was pretty convincing, but you don't want to fool yourself.

1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:57.920
 So being a scientist, for me, we had to go through and try to understand that the instrument

1:20:57.920 --> 1:21:03.000
 itself, which was new, I said we had rebuilt it, couldn't somehow generate things that

1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.800
 look like this.

1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:10.000
 That took some tests, and then the second, you'll appreciate more.

1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:14.640
 We had to somehow convince ourselves we weren't hacked in some clever way.

1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:16.760
 Cyber security question.

1:21:16.760 --> 1:21:19.640
 Even though we're not on the internet, but...

1:21:19.640 --> 1:21:22.440
 Yeah, no, it can be physical access too.

1:21:22.440 --> 1:21:24.440
 Yeah, that's fascinating.

1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:26.000
 It's fascinating that you would think about that.

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:35.640
 I mean, not enough, I mean, because it matches prediction.

1:21:35.640 --> 1:21:40.480
 So the chances of it actually being manipulated is very, very low, but nevertheless...

1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:44.640
 We still could have disgruntled all the graduate students who had worked with us earlier that...

1:21:44.640 --> 1:21:48.440
 Who want you to, I don't know how that's supposed to embarrass you.

1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:52.720
 I suppose, yeah, I suppose I see.

1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:57.160
 But about what I think you said, within a month, you kind of convinced yourself sufficiently.

1:21:57.160 --> 1:21:59.400
 Within a month, we convinced ourselves.

1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:03.240
 We kept a thousand collaborators quiet during that time.

1:22:03.240 --> 1:22:11.120
 Then we spent another month or so trying to understand what we'd seen so that we could

1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:15.200
 do the science with it instead of just putting it out to the world and let somebody else

1:22:15.200 --> 1:22:18.960
 understand that it was two black holes and what it was.

1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:24.000
 The fact that a thousand collaborators were quiet is a really strong indication that this

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.640
 is a really close knit team.

1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:34.840
 Yeah, and they're around the world, or either a strong knit or a tight knit or a strong

1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:36.400
 dictatorship or something.

1:22:36.400 --> 1:22:41.800
 Yeah, either fear or love, you can rule by fear or love, you can go back to Mackey Valley.

1:22:41.800 --> 1:22:51.840
 All right, well, I mean, this is really exciting that that's a success story because it didn't

1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:54.320
 have to be a success story, right?

1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:58.160
 I mean, eventually, perhaps you could say it'll be an event, but it could have taken

1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:00.320
 it over a century to get it.

1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:07.800
 Oh, yeah, yeah, and it's only downhill now, kind of.

1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:13.280
 What do you mean it's only, you mean with gravitational waves?

1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:20.040
 Well, yeah, we've now, well, now we're off because of the pandemic, but when we turned

1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:27.040
 off, we were seeing some sort of gravitational wave event each week.

1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:32.520
 Now we're fixing, we're adding features where it'll probably be, when we turn back on next

1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:37.320
 year, it'll probably be one every couple of days, and they're not all the same.

1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:43.760
 So it's learning about what's out there in gravity instead of just optics.

1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:46.120
 So it's all great.

1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:54.440
 We're only limited by the fantastic thing other than that this is a great field and it's

1:23:54.440 --> 1:24:03.560
 all new and so forth is that experimentally, the great thing is that we're limited by technology

1:24:03.560 --> 1:24:08.240
 and technical limitations, not by science.

1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:18.360
 So another really important discovery that was made before ours was what's called the

1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:22.200
 Higgs boson, made on the big accelerator at CERN.

1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:26.920
 This huge accelerator, they discovered a really important thing.

1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:30.080
 We have Einstein's equation, E equals MC squared.

1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:35.560
 So energy makes mass or mass can make energy and that's the bomb.

1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:44.680
 But the mechanism by which that happens, not vision, but how do you create mass from energy

1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:54.440
 was never understood until there was a theory of it about 70 years ago now.

1:24:54.440 --> 1:25:00.720
 And so they discovered it's named after a man named Higgs, it's called the Higgs boson.

1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:02.960
 And so it was discovered.

1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:07.880
 But since that time, and I worked on those experiments, since that time they haven't

1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:12.280
 been able to progress very much further, a little bit, but not a lot further.

1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:20.520
 And the difference is that we're really lucky in what we're doing in that there you see

1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:24.640
 this Higgs boson, but there's tremendous amount of other physics that goes on and you have

1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:28.320
 to pick out the needle and the haystack kind of physics.

1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:30.960
 You can't make the physics go away, it's there.

1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:37.240
 In our case, we have a very weak signal, but once we get good enough to see it, it's weak

1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:40.080
 compared to where we've reduced the background.

1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:44.320
 But the background is not physics, it's just technology.

1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:50.800
 It's getting ourselves better isolated from the earth or getting a more powerful laser.

1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:59.000
 And so each time, since 2015, when we saw the first one, we continually can make improvements

1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:05.440
 that are enabling us to turn this into a real science to do a new kind of astronomy.

1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:12.360
 It's a little like astronomy, I mean Galileo started the field.

1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:19.360
 I mean, he basically took lenses that were made for classes and he didn't invent the

1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:27.960
 first telescope, but made a telescope, looked at Neptune and saw that it had four moons.

1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:34.040
 That was the birth of not just using your eyes to understand what's out there.

1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:38.560
 And since that time, we've made better and better telescopes, obviously, and astronomy

1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:40.160
 thrives.

1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:46.960
 And in a similar way, we're starting to be able to crawl, but we're starting to be able

1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:50.200
 to do that with gravitational waves.

1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:55.840
 And it's going to be more and more that we can do as we can make better and better instruments.

1:26:55.840 --> 1:27:00.960
 Because as I say, it's not limited by picking it out of others.

1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:02.720
 Yeah, it's not limited by the physics.

1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:08.120
 So you have an optimism about engineering.

1:27:08.120 --> 1:27:16.840
 As human progress marches on, engineering will always find a way to build a large enough

1:27:16.840 --> 1:27:19.680
 device, accurate enough device to detect the physics.

1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:25.480
 As long as it's not limited by physics, yeah, they'll do it.

1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:36.000
 So you two other folks and the entire team won the Nobel Prize for this big effort.

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:49.720
 There's a million questions I can ask for, but looking back, where does the Nobel Prize

1:27:49.720 --> 1:27:52.600
 fit into all of this?

1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:59.120
 If you think hundreds of years from now, I venture to say that people will not remember

1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:03.720
 the winners of a prize, but they'll remember creations like these.

1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:10.200
 Maybe I'm romanticizing engineering, but I guess I want to ask how important is the

1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:12.520
 Nobel Prize in all of this?

1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:19.400
 Well, that's a complicated question.

1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:24.120
 As a physicist, it's something, if you're trying to win a Nobel Prize, forget it because

1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:27.400
 they give one a year.

1:28:27.400 --> 1:28:38.240
 So there's been 200 physicists who have won the Nobel Prize since 1900, and so things

1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:39.360
 just have to fall right.

1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:45.000
 So your goal cannot be to win a Nobel Prize, it wasn't my dream.

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:49.880
 It's tremendous for science.

1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:54.960
 Why the Nobel Prize for a guy that made dynamite and stuff is what it is.

1:28:54.960 --> 1:29:00.600
 It's a long story, but it's the one day a year where actually the science that people

1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:04.560
 have done is all over the world and so forth.

1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:06.760
 Forget about the people again.

1:29:06.760 --> 1:29:09.280
 It is really good for science.

1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:10.280
 Celebrating science.

1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:20.000
 It celebrates science for several days, different fields, chemistry, medicine, and so forth.

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:21.760
 Everybody doesn't understand everything about these.

1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:27.800
 They're generally fairly abstract, but then it's on the front page of newspapers around

1:29:27.800 --> 1:29:28.800
 the world.

1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:29.800
 So it's really good for science.

1:29:29.800 --> 1:29:33.200
 It's not easy to get science on the front page of the New York Times.

1:29:33.200 --> 1:29:39.800
 It's not there, it should be, but it's not.

1:29:39.800 --> 1:29:48.160
 So the Nobel Prize is important in that way, otherwise, I have a certain celebrity that

1:29:48.160 --> 1:29:52.480
 I didn't have before.

1:29:52.480 --> 1:29:55.520
 And now you get to be a celebrity that advertises science.

1:29:55.520 --> 1:30:02.640
 It's a mechanism to remind us how incredible, how much credit science deserves and everything

1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:03.640
 we have.

1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:05.040
 Well, it has a little bit more.

1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:14.000
 One thing I didn't expect, which is good, is that we have a government.

1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:18.840
 I'm not picking on ours necessarily, but it's true of all governments are not run by scientists.

1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:25.560
 In our case, it's run by lawyers and businessmen.

1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:31.040
 And at best, they may have an aide or something that knows a little science.

1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:41.960
 So our country is, and all countries are, hardly take into account science in making

1:30:41.960 --> 1:30:42.960
 decisions.

1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:44.560
 Okay.

1:30:44.560 --> 1:30:53.840
 And having a Nobel Prize, the people in those positions actually listen.

1:30:53.840 --> 1:30:55.800
 So you have more influence.

1:30:55.800 --> 1:31:00.680
 I don't care whether it's about global warming or what the issue is, there's some influence

1:31:00.680 --> 1:31:03.160
 which is lacking otherwise.

1:31:03.160 --> 1:31:06.480
 And people pay attention to what I say.

1:31:06.480 --> 1:31:11.680
 If I talk about global warming, they wouldn't have before I had the Nobel Prize.

1:31:11.680 --> 1:31:14.000
 Yeah, this is very true.

1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:17.560
 You're like the celebrities who talk.

1:31:17.560 --> 1:31:19.560
 Celebrity has power.

1:31:19.560 --> 1:31:20.560
 Celebrity has power.

1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:21.560
 And that's important.

1:31:21.560 --> 1:31:22.560
 And that's a good thing.

1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:23.560
 That's a good thing, yeah.

1:31:23.560 --> 1:31:28.640
 Singling out people, I mean, on the other side of it, singling out people has all kinds

1:31:28.640 --> 1:31:35.640
 of, whether it's for Academy Awards or for this, have unfairness and arbitrariness and

1:31:35.640 --> 1:31:36.800
 so forth and so on.

1:31:36.800 --> 1:31:41.160
 So that's the other side of the coin.

1:31:41.160 --> 1:31:45.720
 As you said, especially with the huge experimental projects like this, you know, it's a large

1:31:45.720 --> 1:31:51.440
 team and it does the nature of the Nobel Prize is it singles out a few individuals to represent

1:31:51.440 --> 1:31:52.440
 the team.

1:31:52.440 --> 1:31:53.440
 Yeah.

1:31:53.440 --> 1:31:55.760
 Nevertheless, it's a beautiful thing.

1:31:55.760 --> 1:32:01.400
 What are ways to improve LIGO in the future, increase the sensitivity?

1:32:01.400 --> 1:32:04.720
 I've seen a few ideas that are kind of fascinating.

1:32:04.720 --> 1:32:09.720
 Is are you interested in them, sort of looking, I'm not speaking about five years, perhaps

1:32:09.720 --> 1:32:13.680
 you could speak to the next five years, but also the next hundred years.

1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:14.680
 Yeah.

1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:18.160
 So let me talk to both the instrument and the science.

1:32:18.160 --> 1:32:19.160
 Sure.

1:32:19.160 --> 1:32:20.800
 So that's, they go hand in hand.

1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:26.720
 I mean, the thing that I said is if we make it better, we see more kinds of weaker objects

1:32:26.720 --> 1:32:30.080
 and we do astronomy, okay?

1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:36.560
 We're very motivated to make a new instrument, which will be a big step, the next step, like

1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:39.720
 making a new kind of telescope person.

1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:45.800
 And the ideas of what that instrument should be haven't converged yet.

1:32:45.800 --> 1:32:47.320
 There's different ideas in Europe.

1:32:47.320 --> 1:32:54.840
 They've done more work to kind of develop the ideas, but they're different from ours

1:32:54.840 --> 1:32:56.760
 and we have ideas.

1:32:56.760 --> 1:33:01.160
 So, but I think over the next few years, we'll develop those.

1:33:01.160 --> 1:33:06.120
 The idea is to make an instrument that's at least 10 times better than what we have,

1:33:06.120 --> 1:33:11.320
 what we can do with this instrument, 10 times better than that, 10 times better means you

1:33:11.320 --> 1:33:18.280
 can look 10 times further out, 10 times further out is a thousand times more volume.

1:33:18.280 --> 1:33:22.440
 So you're seeing much, much more of the universe.

1:33:22.440 --> 1:33:28.640
 The big change is that if you can see far out, you see further back in history.

1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:29.640
 Yeah.

1:33:29.640 --> 1:33:31.640
 You're traveling back in time.

1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:40.000
 And so, we can start to do what we call cosmology instead of astronomy or astrophysics.

1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:43.400
 Cosmology is really the study of the evolution of the...

1:33:43.400 --> 1:33:44.880
 Oh, interesting.

1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:45.880
 Yeah, yeah.

1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:54.080
 And so then you can start to hope to get to the important problems having to do with

1:33:54.080 --> 1:34:01.560
 how the universe began, how it evolved and so forth, which we really only study now with

1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:08.800
 optical instruments or electromagnetic waves.

1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:15.160
 And early in the universe, those were blocked because basically it wasn't transparent.

1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:20.000
 So the photons couldn't get out when everything was too dense.

1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.240
 What do you think, sorry on this tangent, what do you think an understanding of gravitational

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:28.400
 waves from earlier in the universe can help us understand about the big bang and all that

1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:29.400
 kind of stuff?

1:34:29.400 --> 1:34:30.400
 Yeah.

1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:36.240
 But it's another perspective on the thing.

1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:41.280
 Is there some insights you think could be revealed just to help a layman understand?

1:34:41.280 --> 1:34:42.280
 Sure.

1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:43.280
 First, we don't understand.

1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:44.280
 We use the word big bang.

1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:50.480
 We don't understand the physics of what the big bang itself was.

1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:58.360
 So I think in the early stage, there were particles and there was a huge amount of gravity and

1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:00.440
 mass being made.

1:35:00.440 --> 1:35:06.880
 And so the big, so I'll say two things.

1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:09.480
 One is how did it all start?

1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:10.480
 How did it happen?

1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:15.920
 And I'll give you at least one example that we don't understand, but we should understand.

1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:17.600
 We don't know why we're here.

1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:18.600
 Yes.

1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:20.480
 No, we do not.

1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:23.040
 I don't mean it philosophically.

1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:25.160
 I mean it in terms of physics.

1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:26.160
 Okay?

1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:27.240
 Now, what do I mean by that?

1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:33.120
 If I go into my laboratory at CERN or somewhere and I collide particles together or put energy

1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:38.480
 together, I make as much antimatter as matter.

1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:41.960
 Antimatter then annihilates matter and makes energy.

1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:51.360
 So in the early universe, you made somehow a lot of matter and antimatter, but there

1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:53.160
 was an asymmetry.

1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:58.000
 Somehow there was more matter and antimatter than matter and antimatter annihilated each

1:35:58.000 --> 1:35:59.000
 other.

1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:00.000
 At least that's what we think.

1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:06.040
 And there was only matter left over and we live in a universe that we see, this all matter.

1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:07.400
 We don't have any idea.

1:36:07.400 --> 1:36:13.520
 We have an ideas, but we don't have any way to understand that at the present time with

1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:14.920
 the physics that we know.

1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:16.880
 Can I ask a dumb question?

1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:25.080
 Does antimatter have anything like a gravitational field to send signals?

1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:33.600
 So how does this asymmetry of matter and antimatter could be investigated or further understood

1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:37.720
 by observing gravitational fields or weirdnesses in gravitational fields?

1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:46.480
 I think that in principle, if there were anti neutron stars instead of just neutron

1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:52.240
 stars, we would see different kind of signals, but it didn't get to that.

1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:57.080
 We live in a universe that we've done enough looking because we don't see antimatter,

1:36:57.080 --> 1:37:02.280
 anti protons anywhere, no matter what we look at, that it's all made out of matter.

1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:07.920
 There is no antimatter except when we go in our laboratories.

1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:11.560
 But when we go in our laboratories, we make as much antimatter as matter.

1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:15.560
 So there's something about the early universe that made this asymmetry.

1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:17.920
 But we can't even explain why we're here.

1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:20.560
 That's what I meant.

1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:27.120
 Physics wise, not in terms of how we evolved and all that kind of stuff.

1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:36.640
 So there might be inklings of the physics that gravitational waves look like?

1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:40.280
 So gravitational waves don't get obstructed like light.

1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:42.960
 So I said light only goes to 300,000 years.

1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:44.680
 So it goes back to the beginning.

1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:49.680
 So if you could study the early universe with gravitational waves, we can't do that yet.

1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:54.320
 Then it took 400 years to be able to do that with optical.

1:37:54.320 --> 1:38:00.640
 But then you can really understand the very, maybe understand the very early universe.

1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:10.080
 So in terms of questions like why we're here or what the Big Bang was, we should be, we

1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:12.800
 can in principle study that with gravitational waves.

1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:20.600
 So to keep moving in this direction, it's a unique kind of way to understand our universe.

1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:25.320
 So you think there's more Nobel Prize level ideas to be discovered in relation to?

1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:30.920
 I'd be shocked if there, if there isn't, not even going to that, which is a very long

1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:31.920
 range problem.

1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:42.120
 But I think that we only see with electromagnetic waves 4% of what's out there.

1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:47.280
 There must be, we looked for things that we knew should be there.

1:38:47.280 --> 1:38:57.960
 There should be, I would be shocked if there wasn't physics, objects, science, and with

1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:02.120
 gravity that doesn't show up in everything we do with telescopes.

1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:09.760
 So I think we're just limited by not having powerful enough instruments yet to do this.

1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:18.360
 Do you have a preference, I keep seeing this E. Lisa idea.

1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:27.200
 Is it, do you have a preference for earthbound or space faring mechanisms for?

1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:28.400
 They're complementary.

1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:34.400
 It's a little bit like, it's completely analogous to what's been done in astronomy.

1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:42.160
 So astronomy from the time of Galileo was done with visible light.

1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:46.400
 The big advances in astronomy in the last 50 years are because we have instruments that

1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:51.800
 look at the infrared, microwave, ultraviolet, and so forth.

1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:56.000
 So looking at different wavelengths has been important.

1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:01.000
 Basically going into space means that we'll look at instead of the audio band, which we

1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:05.880
 look at, as we said on the Earth's surface, we'll look at lower frequencies.

1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:11.040
 So it's completely complementary and it starts to be looking at different frequencies just

1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:14.520
 like we do with astronomy.

1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:19.000
 It seems almost incredible to me, engineering wise, just like on Earth, to send something

1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:23.840
 that's kilometers across into space.

1:40:23.840 --> 1:40:27.000
 Is that harder to engineer?

1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:28.640
 It actually is a little different.

1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:35.320
 It's three satellites separated by hundreds of thousands of kilometers.

1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:38.800
 And they send a laser beam from one to the other.

1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:45.760
 And if the triangle changes shape a little bit, they detect that from a passenger.

1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:52.960
 Sorry, did you say hundreds of thousands of kilometers sending lasers to each other?

1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:53.960
 Okay.

1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:57.760
 It's just engineering.

1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:02.360
 Is it possible, though, as a Google?

1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:03.360
 Yes.

1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:04.360
 Okay.

1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:11.200
 That's just incredible because they have to maintain, I mean, the precision here is

1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:16.880
 probably, there might be some more, what is it, maybe noise is a smaller problem.

1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:21.960
 I guess there's no vibration to worry about like seismic stuff.

1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:23.960
 So getting away from Earth, maybe you get away from the seismic stuff.

1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:24.960
 Yeah.

1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:25.960
 Those parts are easier.

1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:36.000
 I'm not sure it is accurately at low frequencies, but they have a lot of tough engineering problems.

1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:44.160
 In order to detect that the gravitational waves affect things, the sensors have to be

1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:48.240
 what we call free masses, just like ours, are isolated from the Earth.

1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:51.480
 They have to isolate it from the satellite.

1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:53.320
 And that's a hard problem.

1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:55.680
 They have to do that pretty not as well as we have to do it.

1:41:55.680 --> 1:41:56.680
 Okay.

1:41:56.680 --> 1:41:57.680
 Very well.

1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:05.600
 And they've done a test mission and the engineering seems to be at least in principle in hand.

1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:08.000
 This will be in the 2030s, when it's like...

1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:09.000
 2030s?

1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:10.000
 Yeah.

1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000
 This is incredible.

1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.680
 This is incredible.

1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:17.360
 Let me ask about black holes.

1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:26.120
 So what we're talking about is observing orbiting black holes.

1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:29.160
 I saw the terminology of like binary black hole systems.

1:42:29.160 --> 1:42:30.400
 Binary black holes.

1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:32.200
 That's when they're dancing.

1:42:32.200 --> 1:42:36.520
 We're going around each other just like the Earth around the sun.

1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:40.240
 Is that weird that there's black holes going around each other?

1:42:40.240 --> 1:42:46.200
 So the finding binary systems of stars is similar to finding binary systems of black

1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:47.200
 holes.

1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:51.440
 They're one stars.

1:42:51.440 --> 1:42:56.040
 So we haven't said what a black hole is physically yet.

1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:57.040
 Yeah.

1:42:57.040 --> 1:42:58.040
 What's a black hole?

1:42:58.040 --> 1:43:02.880
 So black hole is first, it's a mathematical concept or a physical concept.

1:43:02.880 --> 1:43:05.760
 And that is a region of space.

1:43:05.760 --> 1:43:11.800
 So it's simply a region of space where the curvature of spacetime in the gravitational

1:43:11.800 --> 1:43:18.440
 field is so strong that nothing can get out, including light.

1:43:18.440 --> 1:43:26.560
 And there's light gets bent in gravitational, if the spacetime is warped enough.

1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:29.760
 And so even light gets bent around and stays in it.

1:43:29.760 --> 1:43:31.560
 So that's a concept of a black hole.

1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:33.560
 So it's not a...

1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:35.400
 And maybe you can make...

1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:40.880
 Maybe that's a concept that didn't say how they come about.

1:43:40.880 --> 1:43:43.560
 And there could be different ways they come about.

1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:52.680
 The ones that we are seeing, we're not sure what we're trying to learn now is what they...

1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:58.560
 But the general expectation is that they come...

1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:02.200
 These black holes happen when a star dies.

1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:03.880
 So what does that mean that a star dies?

1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:04.880
 What happens?

1:44:04.880 --> 1:44:14.280
 A star like our sun basically makes heat and light by fusion, it's made up.

1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:20.960
 And as it burns, it burns up the hydrogen and then the helium and then slowly works its

1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:26.280
 way up to the heavier and heavier elements that are in the star.

1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:30.840
 And when it gets up to iron, the fusion process doesn't work anymore.

1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:37.480
 And so the stars die and that happens to stars and then they do what's called a supernova.

1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:43.800
 What happens then is that a star is a delicate balance between an outward pressure from fusion

1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:52.760
 and light and burning and an inward pressure of gravity trying to pull the masses together.

1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:55.200
 Once it burns itself out, it goes...

1:44:55.200 --> 1:44:57.960
 And it collapses and that's a supernova.

1:44:57.960 --> 1:45:05.640
 When it collapses, all the mass that was there is in a very much smaller space and if a star...

1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:12.400
 If you do the calculations, if a star is big enough, that can create a strong enough gravitational

1:45:12.400 --> 1:45:15.440
 field to make a black hole.

1:45:15.440 --> 1:45:19.600
 Our sun won't, it's too small.

1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:23.160
 And we don't know exactly what it...

1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:29.760
 But it's usually thought that a star has to be at least three times as big as our sun

1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:30.760
 to make a black hole.

1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:32.360
 But that's the physical way there.

1:45:32.360 --> 1:45:34.160
 You can make black holes.

1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:43.520
 That's the first explanation that one would give for what we see, but it's not necessarily

1:45:43.520 --> 1:45:44.520
 true.

1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:45.520
 We're not sure yet.

1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:48.600
 What we see in terms of the origin of the black holes?

1:45:48.600 --> 1:45:52.480
 No, the black holes that we see in gravitational waves.

1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:57.400
 So you're also looking for the ones who are binary solar systems?

1:45:57.400 --> 1:46:01.760
 They're binary systems, but they could have been made from binary stars, so there's binary

1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:02.760
 stars around.

1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:10.120
 So the first explanation is that that's what they are.

1:46:10.120 --> 1:46:15.160
 Other explanation, but what we see has some puzzles.

1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:19.440
 This is kind of the way science works, I guess.

1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:25.360
 We see heavier ones than up to...

1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:32.160
 We've seen one system that was 140 times the mass of our own sun.

1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:40.240
 That's not believed to be possible with the parent being a big star, because big stars

1:46:40.240 --> 1:46:45.640
 can only be so big or they are unstable.

1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:51.440
 It's just the fact that they live in an environment that makes them unstable.

1:46:51.440 --> 1:46:56.160
 So the fact that we see bigger ones, they maybe come from something else.

1:46:56.160 --> 1:47:04.520
 It's possible that they were made in a different way by little ones eating each other up, or

1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:11.600
 maybe they were made, or maybe they came with the big bang, what we call primordial, which

1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:13.000
 means they're really different.

1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:14.200
 They came from that.

1:47:14.200 --> 1:47:15.840
 We don't know at this point.

1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:20.760
 If they came with a big bang, then maybe they account for what we call dark matter or some

1:47:20.760 --> 1:47:21.760
 of it.

1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:29.440
 There was a lot of them, because there's a lot of dark matter, but gravitational waves

1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:34.440
 give you any kind of intuition about the origin of these oscillating.

1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:40.320
 We think that if we see the distributions enough of them, the distributions of their

1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:45.800
 masses, the distributions of how they're spinning, so we can actually measure when they're going

1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:50.200
 around each other, whether they're spinning like this or around.

1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:51.200
 The direction of the spin?

1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:52.200
 Yeah.

1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:53.200
 Or no, the orientation.

1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:56.000
 Whether the whole system has any wobbles.

1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:57.320
 What?

1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:00.640
 So this is now, okay.

1:48:00.640 --> 1:48:01.640
 We're doing that.

1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:04.680
 And then you're constantly kind of crawling back and back in time.

1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:08.880
 And we're crawling back in time and seeing how many there are as we go back.

1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:10.640
 And so do they point back?

1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:14.200
 So you're like, what is that discipline called, cartography or something?

1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:22.120
 You're like mapping this, the early universe via the lens of gravitational waves.

1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:28.360
 Not yet the early universe, but at least back in time earlier.

1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:33.320
 So black holes are this mathematical phenomenon, but they come about in different ways.

1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:39.200
 We have a huge black hole at the center of our galaxy and other galaxies.

1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:40.880
 Those probably were made some other way.

1:48:40.880 --> 1:48:46.040
 We don't know when the galaxies themselves had to do with the formation of the galaxies.

1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:47.200
 We don't really know.

1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:52.840
 So the fact that we use the word black hole, the origin of black holes might be quite different

1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:56.120
 depending on how they happen.

1:48:56.120 --> 1:49:01.400
 They just have to in the end have a gravitational field that will bend everything in.

1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:04.280
 How do you feel about black holes as a human being?

1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:12.280
 There's this thing that's nearly infinitely dense, doesn't let light escape.

1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:13.280
 Isn't that kind of terrifying?

1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:15.680
 It feels like the stuff of nightmares.

1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:21.520
 I think it's an opportunity to do what exactly?

1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:24.760
 So like the early universe is an opportunity.

1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:26.680
 In fact, we can study the early universe.

1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:28.640
 We can learn things like I told you.

1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:34.160
 And here again, we have an embarrassing situation in physics.

1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:40.920
 We have two wonderful theories of physics, one based on quantum mechanics, quantum field

1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:41.920
 theory.

1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:48.000
 And we can go to a big accelerator like at CERN and smash particles together and almost

1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:54.920
 explain anything that happens beautifully using quantum field theory and quantum mechanics.

1:49:54.920 --> 1:49:58.800
 Then we have another theory of physics called general relativity, which is what we've been

1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:05.760
 talking about most of the time, which is fantastic at describing things at high velocities,

1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:10.480
 long distances, and so forth.

1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:15.720
 So that's not the way it's supposed to be.

1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:20.320
 We're trying to create a theory of physics, not two theories of physics.

1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:24.760
 So we have an embarrassment that we have two different theories of physics.

1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:29.120
 People have tried to make a unified theory, what they call a unified theory.

1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:32.440
 You've heard those words for decades.

1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:33.680
 They still haven't.

1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:41.040
 That's been primarily done theoretically, or people actively do that.

1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:47.920
 My personal belief is that like much of physics, we need some clues.

1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:49.680
 So we need some experimental evidence.

1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:52.360
 So where is their place?

1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:56.400
 If we go to CERN and do those experiments, gravitational waves or general relativity

1:50:56.400 --> 1:50:57.720
 don't matter.

1:50:57.720 --> 1:51:03.680
 If we go to study our black holes, elementary particle physics doesn't matter.

1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:05.560
 We're studying these huge objects.

1:51:05.560 --> 1:51:11.040
 So where might we have a place where both phenomenon have to be satisfied?

1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:13.280
 An example is black holes.

1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:14.280
 Inside black holes.

1:51:14.280 --> 1:51:15.280
 Yeah.

1:51:15.280 --> 1:51:17.280
 So we can't do that today.

1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:25.320
 But when I think of black hole, it's a potential treasure chest of understanding the fundamental

1:51:25.320 --> 1:51:34.360
 problems of physics and maybe can give us clues to how we bring to the embarrassment

1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:37.840
 of having two theories of physics together.

1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:39.960
 That's my own romantic idea.

1:51:39.960 --> 1:51:41.480
 What's the worst that could happen?

1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:42.560
 It's so enticing.

1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:44.120
 Just go in and look.

1:51:44.120 --> 1:51:50.520
 Do you think how far are we away from figuring out the unified theory of physics, the theory

1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:51.520
 of everything?

1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:52.520
 I think...

1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:53.520
 What's your sense?

1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:54.520
 Who will solve it?

1:51:54.520 --> 1:51:56.800
 Like what discipline will solve it?

1:51:56.800 --> 1:51:59.320
 Yeah.

1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:13.640
 I think so little progress has been made without more experimental clues, as I said, that we're

1:52:13.640 --> 1:52:20.720
 just not able to say that we're close without some clues.

1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:27.600
 The best, the closest, the most popular theory these days that might lead to that is called

1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:30.000
 string theory.

1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:35.840
 The problem with string theory is it solves a lot of beautiful mathematical problems we

1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:49.360
 have in physics, and it's very satisfying theoretically, but it has almost no predictive,

1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:56.800
 maybe no predictive ability, because it is a theory that works in 11 dimensions.

1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:02.120
 We live in a physical world of three space and one time dimension.

1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:08.480
 In order to make predictions in our world with string theory, you have to somehow get

1:53:08.480 --> 1:53:12.280
 rid of these other seven dimensions.

1:53:12.280 --> 1:53:17.240
 That's done mathematically by saying they curl up on each other on scales that are too

1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:23.400
 small to affect anything here, but how you do that, and that's okay, that's an okay argument,

1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:27.680
 but how you do that is not unique.

1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:32.480
 So that means if I start with that theory and I go to our world here, I can't uniquely

1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:33.480
 go to it.

1:53:33.480 --> 1:53:35.360
 Which means it's not predictive.

1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:36.680
 It's not predictive.

1:53:36.680 --> 1:53:39.880
 And that's actually a killer.

1:53:39.880 --> 1:53:44.120
 And string theory is, it seems like from my outsider's perspective is lost favor over

1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:46.680
 the years, perhaps because of this very idea.

1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:48.600
 Yeah, it's a lack of predictive power.

1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:55.480
 I mean, science has to connect to something where you make predictions as beautiful as

1:53:55.480 --> 1:53:56.480
 it might be.

1:53:56.480 --> 1:53:57.760
 So I don't think we're close.

1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:01.880
 I think we need some experimental clues.

1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:08.320
 It may be that information on something we don't understand presently at all like dark

1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:14.680
 energy or probably not dark matter, but dark energy or something might give us some ideas.

1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:26.160
 But I don't think we're, I can't envision right now in the short term, meaning the horizon

1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:31.720
 that we can see how we're going to bring these two theories together.

1:54:31.720 --> 1:54:38.520
 A kind of two part question, maybe just asking the same thing in two different ways.

1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:47.720
 One question is, do you have hope that humans will colonize the galaxy, so expand out become

1:54:47.720 --> 1:54:49.960
 a multi planetary species?

1:54:49.960 --> 1:54:54.480
 Another way of asking that from a gravitational and a propulsion perspective, do you think

1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:58.160
 we'll come up with ways to travel closer to the speed of light or maybe faster than the

1:54:58.160 --> 1:55:04.920
 speed of light, which would make it a whole heck of a lot easier to expand out into the

1:55:04.920 --> 1:55:05.920
 universe?

1:55:05.920 --> 1:55:06.920
 Yeah.

1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:15.640
 Well, I think, you know, we're not, that's very futuristic.

1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:23.320
 I think we're not that far from being able to make a one way trip to Mars.

1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:31.680
 That's then a question of whether people are willing to send somebody on a one way trip.

1:55:31.680 --> 1:55:32.680
 Oh, I think they are.

1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:36.840
 I think there's a lot of the explorers burn bright with their hearts.

1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:37.840
 Yeah, exactly.

1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:42.920
 There's a lot of people willing to die, but the opportunity to explore new territory.

1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:49.960
 So, you know, this recent landing on Mars is pretty impressive.

1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:52.000
 They have a little helicopter that can fly around.

1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:57.880
 You can imagine, you can imagine in the not too distant future that you could have, I

1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:04.520
 don't think civilizations colonizing, I can envision, but I can envision something more

1:56:04.520 --> 1:56:06.440
 like the South Pole.

1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:13.440
 We haven't colonized Antarctica because it's all ice and cold and so forth, but we have

1:56:13.440 --> 1:56:16.440
 stations.

1:56:16.440 --> 1:56:21.240
 So we have a station that's self sustaining at the South Pole that I've been there.

1:56:21.240 --> 1:56:22.240
 It has.

1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:23.240
 Wow, really?

1:56:23.240 --> 1:56:24.240
 Yeah.

1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:30.120
 What's that like because there's parallels there to go to Mars.

1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:31.120
 It's fantastic.

1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:33.480
 What's the journey like?

1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:41.320
 The journey involves going, the South Pole station is run in the U.S. by the National

1:56:41.320 --> 1:56:42.920
 Science Foundation.

1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:49.680
 I went because I was on the National Science Board that runs the National Science Foundation.

1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:58.120
 So you get a VIP trip if you're healthy enough to the South Pole to see it, which I took.

1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:09.320
 You fly from the U.S. to Australia, to Christchurch in Southern Australia, and from there you

1:57:09.320 --> 1:57:14.840
 fly to McMurdo Station, which is on the coast, and it's the station with about a thousand

1:57:14.840 --> 1:57:18.400
 people right on the coast of Antarctica.

1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:23.160
 It's about a seven or eight hour flight, and they can't predict the weather.

1:57:23.160 --> 1:57:29.840
 So when I flew from Christchurch to McMurdo Station, they tell you in advance, you do

1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:35.440
 it in a military aircraft, they tell you in advance that they can't predict whether they

1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:38.400
 can land because they have to land on ice.

1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:39.400
 That's reassuring.

1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:40.400
 Yeah.

1:57:40.400 --> 1:57:47.880
 And so about halfway, the pilot got on and said, sorry, they call it a boomerang flight.

1:57:47.880 --> 1:57:51.040
 Boomerang goes out and goes back.

1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:56.840
 So we had to stay a little while in Christchurch, but then we eventually went to McMurdo Station

1:57:56.840 --> 1:58:00.360
 and then flew to the South Pole.

1:58:00.360 --> 1:58:07.840
 The South Pole itself is, when I was there, it was minus 51 degrees.

1:58:07.840 --> 1:58:11.600
 That was summer.

1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:27.120
 It has zero humidity, and it's about 11,000 feet altitude because it's never warm enough

1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:33.360
 for anything to melt, so it doesn't snow very much, but it's about 11,000 feet of snowpack.

1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:43.040
 So you land in a place that's high altitude, cold as could be, and incredibly dry, which

1:58:43.040 --> 1:58:46.600
 means you have a physical adjustment.

1:58:46.600 --> 1:58:51.840
 The place itself is fantastic.

1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:54.760
 They have this great station there.

1:58:54.760 --> 1:58:56.840
 They do astronomy at the South Pole.

1:58:56.840 --> 1:59:03.640
 Which of wise is it beautiful, what's the experience like, or is it like visiting any

1:59:03.640 --> 1:59:04.640
 town?

1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:05.640
 No, it's very small.

1:59:05.640 --> 1:59:10.880
 There's only less than 100 people there, even when I was there.

1:59:10.880 --> 1:59:16.400
 There were about 50 or 60 there, and in the winter, there's less, half of that.

1:59:16.400 --> 1:59:17.400
 They're winter.

1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:18.400
 Yeah.

1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:19.400
 It gets real cold.

1:59:19.400 --> 1:59:22.160
 It gets really cold, yeah.

1:59:22.160 --> 1:59:30.920
 But it's a station, and I think, and that's, I mean, we haven't gone beyond that.

1:59:30.920 --> 1:59:36.760
 On the coast of Antarctica, they have greenhouses and they're self sustaining in McMurdo station,

1:59:36.760 --> 1:59:46.640
 but we haven't really settled more than that kind of thing in Antarctica, which is a big

1:59:46.640 --> 1:59:55.440
 country, a big plot, a big piece of land.

1:59:55.440 --> 2:00:04.640
 I can't envision colonizing people living so much as much as I can see of the equivalent

2:00:04.640 --> 2:00:06.800
 of the South Pole station.

2:00:06.800 --> 2:00:11.600
 In the computing world, there's an idea of backing up your data, and then you want to

2:00:11.600 --> 2:00:18.920
 do offsite backup to make sure that if your whole house burns down, that you can have

2:00:18.920 --> 2:00:21.240
 a backup offsite of the data.

2:00:21.240 --> 2:00:27.920
 I think the difference between Antarctica and Mars is Mars is an offsite backup, that

2:00:27.920 --> 2:00:32.120
 if we have nuclear war, whatever the heck might happen here on Earth, it'd be nice to

2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:36.800
 have a backup elsewhere, and it'd be nice to have a large enough colony where we sent

2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:47.400
 a variety of people, except a few silly astronauts in suits, have an actual vibrant, get a few

2:00:47.400 --> 2:00:52.520
 musicians and artists up there, get a few, maybe like one or two computer scientists,

2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:57.720
 those are essential, maybe even a physicist, but I'm not sure.

2:00:57.720 --> 2:01:03.880
 That comes back to something you talked about earlier, which is the paradox, family's paradox,

2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:10.480
 because you talked about having to escape, and so the missing, one number you don't know

2:01:10.480 --> 2:01:16.560
 how to use in Fermi's calculation or Drake who's done it better, is how long do civilizations

2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:25.320
 last before we barely got into where we can communicate with electricity and magnetism,

2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:28.320
 and maybe we'll wipe ourselves out pretty soon.

2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:29.880
 Are you hopeful in general?

2:01:29.880 --> 2:01:35.600
 Do you think we've got another couple hundred years at least, or are you worried?

2:01:35.600 --> 2:01:42.480
 Well, no, I'm hopeful, but I don't know if I'm hopeful in the long term.

2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:54.720
 If you say, are we able to go for another couple thousand years, I'm not sure.

2:01:54.720 --> 2:02:00.000
 We have, where we started, the fact that we can do things that don't allow us to kind

2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:05.840
 of keep going, or there can be, whether it ends up being a virus that we create or ends

2:02:05.840 --> 2:02:10.800
 up being the equivalent of nuclear war or something else, it's not clear that we can

2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:13.080
 control things well enough.

2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:20.480
 So speaking of really cold conditions and not being hopeful and eventual suffering and

2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:24.680
 destruction of the human species, let me ask you about Russian literature.

2:02:24.680 --> 2:02:29.800
 You mentioned, how's that for a transition, I'm doing my best here.

2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:36.160
 You mentioned that you used to love literature when you were younger, or hoping to be a writer

2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:38.520
 yourself, that was the motivation.

2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:45.840
 And some of the books I've seen that you listed that were inspiring to you was from Russian

2:02:45.840 --> 2:02:52.520
 literature, I think Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Solzhenitsyn.

2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:57.320
 Maybe in general, you can speak to your fascination with Russian literature, or in general, will

2:02:57.320 --> 2:03:00.120
 you pick up from those?

2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:08.320
 Not surprised you picked up on the Russian literature, your background, but still.

2:03:08.320 --> 2:03:11.920
 You should be surprised that they didn't make the entire conversation about this.

2:03:11.920 --> 2:03:13.920
 That's the real surprise.

2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:24.280
 And I didn't really become a physicist or want to go in science until I started college.

2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:29.680
 So when I was younger, I was good at math and that kind of stuff, but I didn't really,

2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:36.040
 I came from a family that didn't know what he went to college and I didn't have any mentors.

2:03:36.040 --> 2:03:38.400
 But I'd like to read when I was really young.

2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:45.200
 And so when I was very young, I read, I always carried it around a pocketbook and read it.

2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:49.840
 And my mother read these mystery stories and I got bored by those eventually.

2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:51.600
 And then I discovered real literature.

2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:55.520
 I don't know at what age, but about 12 or 13.

2:03:55.520 --> 2:04:00.640
 And so then I started reading good literature and there's nothing better than Russian literature,

2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:01.640
 of course.

2:04:01.640 --> 2:04:02.640
 Thank you.

2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:03.640
 You heard it.

2:04:03.640 --> 2:04:15.880
 I was reading good literature, so I read quite a bit of Russian literature at that time.

2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:22.160
 And so you asked me about, well, I don't know, say a few words, Dostoevsky.

2:04:22.160 --> 2:04:23.960
 So what about Dostoevsky?

2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:33.520
 For me, Dostoevsky was important in two, I mean, I've read a lot of literature because

2:04:33.520 --> 2:04:36.080
 it's kind of the other thing I do with my life.

2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:43.200
 And he made two incredible, in addition to his own literature, he influenced literature

2:04:43.200 --> 2:04:49.280
 tremendously by having, I don't know how to pronounce, polyphony.

2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:57.000
 So he's the first real serious author that had multiple narrators.

2:04:57.000 --> 2:05:00.560
 And that's a, he absolutely is the first.

2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:07.480
 And he also was the first, he began existential literature.

2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:12.880
 So the most important book that I've read in the last year when I've been forced to

2:05:12.880 --> 2:05:21.200
 be isolated was existential literature, it was, I decided to reread Camus the Plague.

2:05:21.200 --> 2:05:23.880
 Oh, yeah, that's a great book.

2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:26.240
 It's a great book and it's right now to read it.

2:05:26.240 --> 2:05:27.240
 It's fantastic.

2:05:27.240 --> 2:05:29.560
 I think that book is about love, actually.

2:05:29.560 --> 2:05:30.560
 Love for humanity.

2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:36.280
 It is, but it has all the, it has all the, if you haven't read it in recent years, I'd

2:05:36.280 --> 2:05:41.360
 read it before, of course, but to read it during this, because it's about a plague.

2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:46.440
 So it's really fantastic to read now, but that reminds me of, you know, he was a great

2:05:46.440 --> 2:05:51.920
 existentialist, but the beginning of existential literature was Dostoevsky.

2:05:51.920 --> 2:06:00.280
 So in addition to his own, you know, great novels, he had a tremendous impact on literature.

2:06:00.280 --> 2:06:06.200
 And there's also, for Dostoevsky, unlike most of their existentialists, he was at least

2:06:06.200 --> 2:06:07.200
 in part religious.

2:06:07.200 --> 2:06:11.480
 I mean, their religiosity permeated his idea.

2:06:11.480 --> 2:06:16.120
 I mean, one of my favorite books of his is The Idiot, which is a Christlike figure in

2:06:16.120 --> 2:06:17.120
 there.

2:06:17.120 --> 2:06:19.360
 Well, there's Prince Mishkin, is that a saying?

2:06:19.360 --> 2:06:20.360
 Prince Mishkin, yeah.

2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:21.360
 Yeah, Mishkin.

2:06:21.360 --> 2:06:22.360
 Yeah, Mishkin.

2:06:22.360 --> 2:06:23.360
 Yeah.

2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:25.920
 That's one thing about, you read it in English, I presume.

2:06:25.920 --> 2:06:26.920
 Yeah, yeah.

2:06:26.920 --> 2:06:27.920
 Yeah.

2:06:27.920 --> 2:06:28.920
 So that's the names.

2:06:28.920 --> 2:06:29.920
 That's what gets a lot of people.

2:06:29.920 --> 2:06:30.920
 There's so many names.

2:06:30.920 --> 2:06:31.920
 It's so hard to pronounce.

2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:32.920
 You have to remember all of them.

2:06:32.920 --> 2:06:35.680
 It's like, you have the same problem.

2:06:35.680 --> 2:06:38.320
 But he was a great character, so that, yeah.

2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:47.240
 I kind of, I have a connection with him, because I often, the title of the book, The Idiot,

2:06:47.240 --> 2:06:51.680
 is, I kind of, I often call myself an idiot, because that's how I feel.

2:06:51.680 --> 2:06:53.880
 I feel so naive about this world.

2:06:53.880 --> 2:07:03.920
 And I'm not sure why that is, maybe it's genetic or so on, but I have a connection, a spiritual

2:07:03.920 --> 2:07:05.160
 connection to that character.

2:07:05.160 --> 2:07:06.160
 To Mishkin.

2:07:06.160 --> 2:07:07.160
 To Mishkin, yeah.

2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:10.160
 But he was far from an idiot.

2:07:10.160 --> 2:07:14.680
 No, in some sense, in some sense.

2:07:14.680 --> 2:07:17.400
 But in another sense, maybe not of this world.

2:07:17.400 --> 2:07:23.000
 In another sense, he was, I mean, he was a bumbler or bungler.

2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:28.200
 But you also mentioned Solzhenitsyn, very interesting.

2:07:28.200 --> 2:07:29.520
 And he always confused me.

2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:41.680
 Of course, he was really, really important in writing about Stalin, and first getting

2:07:41.680 --> 2:07:42.680
 in trouble.

2:07:42.680 --> 2:07:51.640
 And then, later, he wrote about Stalin in a way, I forget what the book was, in a way

2:07:51.640 --> 2:07:54.960
 that was very critical of Lenin.

2:07:54.960 --> 2:08:00.640
 Yeah, he's evolved through the years, and he actually showed support for Putin eventually.

2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:08.440
 It was a very interesting transition he took, no, journey he took through thinking about

2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:11.520
 Russia and the Soviet Union.

2:08:11.520 --> 2:08:18.800
 But I think what I get from him is basic, it's like Viktor Frankl has this man search

2:08:18.800 --> 2:08:19.800
 for meaning.

2:08:19.800 --> 2:08:29.440
 A similar kind of sense of the cruelty of human nature, cruelty of indifference, but

2:08:29.440 --> 2:08:34.680
 also the ability to find happiness in the small joys of life.

2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:39.400
 That's something, there's nothing like a prison camp that makes you realize you could

2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:41.760
 still be happy with a very, very little.

2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:48.600
 Well, yeah, he was, his description of how to make, how to go through a day and actually

2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:54.760
 enjoy it in a prison camp is pretty amazing, and some prison camp, I mean, it's the worst

2:08:54.760 --> 2:08:55.760
 of the worst.

2:08:55.760 --> 2:08:56.760
 The worst of the worst.

2:08:56.760 --> 2:09:08.520
 And also just, I do think about the role of authoritarian states and hopeful idealistic

2:09:08.520 --> 2:09:12.240
 systems somehow leading to the suffering of millions.

2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:20.440
 And I, you know, this might be arguable, but I think a lot of people believe that Stalin,

2:09:20.440 --> 2:09:24.200
 I think genuinely believed that he's doing good for the world.

2:09:24.200 --> 2:09:32.000
 And he wasn't, it's a very valuable lesson that even evil people think they're doing

2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:34.000
 good.

2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:36.480
 Otherwise it's too difficult to do the evil.

2:09:36.480 --> 2:09:40.880
 The best way to do evil is to believe framing it in a way like you're doing good.

2:09:40.880 --> 2:09:48.160
 And this is, this is a very clear picture of that, which is the gulags.

2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:52.040
 The Solzhenitsyn is one of the best people to reveal that.

2:09:52.040 --> 2:09:53.360
 Yeah.

2:09:53.360 --> 2:09:58.800
 The most recent thing I read, it isn't actually fiction, was the, the woman, I can't remember

2:09:58.800 --> 2:10:03.760
 her name, who got the Nobel Prize about, within the last five years.

2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:09.680
 I don't know whether she's Ukrainian or Russian, but their interviews, have you read that?

2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:15.040
 Interview of Ukrainian survivors of, well, I think she may be originally Ukrainian.

2:10:15.040 --> 2:10:20.880
 The books written in Russian and translated in English and many of the interviews are

2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:26.840
 in Moscow and places, but she won the Nobel Prize within the last five years or so.

2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:35.720
 But what's interesting is that these are people of all different ages, all different occupations

2:10:35.720 --> 2:10:43.000
 and so forth, and they're reflecting on the, their reaction to basically the present Soviet

2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:45.520
 system, the system they lived with before.

2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:57.880
 There's a lot of looking back by a lot of them with, well, it being much better before.

2:10:57.880 --> 2:11:00.880
 Yeah.

2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:05.320
 I don't know what, in America, we think we know the right answer.

2:11:05.320 --> 2:11:08.480
 What it means to be, to build a better world.

2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:10.120
 I'm not so sure.

2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:12.200
 I think we're all just trying to figure it out.

2:11:12.200 --> 2:11:13.200
 Yeah.

2:11:13.200 --> 2:11:14.200
 We're doing our best.

2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:17.560
 I think you're right.

2:11:17.560 --> 2:11:23.720
 Is there advice you can give to young people today, besides reading Russian literature

2:11:23.720 --> 2:11:29.640
 at a young age, about how to find their way in life, how to find success in career or

2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:31.880
 just life in general?

2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:42.000
 I, I just, my own belief, it may not be very deep, but I believe it.

2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:46.880
 I think you should follow your dreams and you should have dreams and follow your dreams,

2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:50.400
 if you can, to the extent that you can.

2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:56.000
 And we spend a lot of our time doing something with ourselves, in my case, physics, in your

2:11:56.000 --> 2:12:00.880
 case, I don't know, whatever it is, machine learning and this.

2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:06.640
 Uh, we should, yeah, should have fun.

2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:09.160
 What was, wait, wait, wait, follow your dreams.

2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:11.040
 What, uh, what dream did you have?

2:12:11.040 --> 2:12:15.520
 Because there's, well, well, originally I was, yeah, because you didn't follow your

2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:16.520
 dream.

2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:17.520
 I thought you were supposed to be right.

2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:18.520
 Well, that's, I changed along the way.

2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:19.520
 I was going to be, okay.

2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:20.520
 But I changed.

2:12:20.520 --> 2:12:21.520
 What happened?

2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:22.520
 That was what happened.

2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:30.480
 Oh, I read, I decided to take the most serious literature course in my high school, which

2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:31.480
 was a mistake.

2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:37.480
 I'd probably be a second rate writer now and, uh, could be a Nobel Prize winning writer.

2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:47.760
 And, uh, uh, the, uh, the book that we read, even though I had read Russian novels, I was

2:12:47.760 --> 2:12:53.080
 15, I think, uh, cured me from being a novelist.

2:12:53.080 --> 2:12:54.080
 Destroyed your dream.

2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:55.080
 Yes.

2:12:55.080 --> 2:12:56.080
 Cured you.

2:12:56.080 --> 2:12:57.080
 Okay.

2:12:57.080 --> 2:12:58.080
 What was the book?

2:12:58.080 --> 2:12:59.080
 Moby Dick.

2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:00.080
 Okay.

2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:01.080
 Moby Dick.

2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:02.080
 Yeah.

2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:03.080
 Why?

2:13:03.080 --> 2:13:06.360
 And so I, I've read it since and it's a, it's a great novel.

2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:07.720
 Maybe it's as good as the Russian novel.

2:13:07.720 --> 2:13:08.720
 I've never made it through.

2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:10.880
 I, I, well, it was too, well, it was too long.

2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:11.880
 Okay.

2:13:11.880 --> 2:13:14.240
 Your words are going to mesh with what I say.

2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:15.240
 Excellent.

2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:19.520
 And you may have the same problem at, uh, all the way, that's where I'm not a writer.

2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:20.520
 It may be.

2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:27.240
 So the problem is Moby Dick is, uh, what I remember was there was a chapter that was

2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:34.000
 maybe a hundred pages long, all describing this why there was Ahab and the white whale.

2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:39.500
 And it was the battle between Ahab with his wooden peg leg and the white whale.

2:13:39.500 --> 2:13:42.680
 And there was a chapter that was a hundred pages long in my memory.

2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:48.720
 I don't know how long it really was, uh, that described in detail, though, great white whale

2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:52.320
 and what he was doing and what his fins were like and this and that.

2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:59.560
 And it was so incredibly boring, the word you used that I thought if this is great literature,

2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:00.560
 screw it.

2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:01.560
 Fascinating.

2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:02.560
 Okay.

2:14:02.560 --> 2:14:04.160
 And now why did I have a problem?

2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:11.760
 I know now in reflection because I still read a lot and I, I read that, uh, novel, um,

2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:18.400
 you know, after I was 30 or 40 years old and the problem was simple.

2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:20.520
 I, I diagnosed what the problem was.

2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:28.040
 I, that novel in contrast to the Russian novels, which are very realistic and, you know, point

2:14:28.040 --> 2:14:31.000
 of view is one huge metaphor.

2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:33.000
 Oh yeah.

2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:37.240
 At 15 years old, I probably didn't know the word and I certainly didn't know the meaning

2:14:37.240 --> 2:14:38.240
 of metaphor.

2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:39.240
 Yeah.

2:14:39.240 --> 2:14:40.240
 Like, why do I care about a fish?

2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:44.160
 Why are you telling me all about this exactly is one big metaphor.

2:14:44.160 --> 2:14:49.400
 So reading it later as a metaphor, I could really enjoy it, but the teacher gave me the

2:14:49.400 --> 2:14:54.960
 wrong book or maybe it was the right book because I went into physics and so, uh, but

2:14:54.960 --> 2:14:59.960
 it was, it was truly, I think I may oversimplify, but it was really that I was too young to

2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:04.880
 read that book because not too young to read the Russian novels, interestingly, but too

2:15:04.880 --> 2:15:09.320
 young to read that because I, I probably didn't even know the word and I certainly didn't

2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:11.520
 understand it as a metaphor.

2:15:11.520 --> 2:15:15.440
 Well in terms of fish, I recommend people read old man and the sea much shorter, much

2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:22.280
 better, still a metaphor though, so, but you can read it just as a story about a guy catching

2:15:22.280 --> 2:15:26.160
 a fish and it's still fun to read.

2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:31.480
 I had the same experience as you, not with Moby Dick, but later in college, I took a

2:15:31.480 --> 2:15:36.520
 course on James Joyce, I don't know why, as majoring in computer science, I took a course

2:15:36.520 --> 2:15:43.440
 on James Joyce and I was kept being told that he is widely considered by many considered

2:15:43.440 --> 2:15:50.720
 to be the greatest literary writer of the 20th century and I kept reading like, I think,

2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:55.040
 so his short story is The Dead, I think it's called, it was very good, well not very good,

2:15:55.040 --> 2:16:01.120
 but pretty good and then Ulysses, it is very good, only The Dead, the final story, it still

2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:06.840
 rings with me today, but then Ulysses was, I got through Ulysses with the help of some

2:16:06.840 --> 2:16:12.280
 Cliff Notes and so on, but and so I did Ulysses and then Finnegan's Wake, the moment I started

2:16:12.280 --> 2:16:21.160
 Finnegan's Wake, I said, this is stupid, this is, that's when I went full into like, I don't

2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:27.240
 know, that's when I went full Kafka, Bukowski, like people who just talk about the darkness

2:16:27.240 --> 2:16:35.840
 of the human condition in the fewest words possible and without any of the music of language,

2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:42.400
 so it was a turning point as well, I wonder, I wonder when is the right time to do the,

2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:47.160
 to appreciate the beauty of language, like even Shakespeare, I was very much off put

2:16:47.160 --> 2:16:52.120
 by Shakespeare in high school and only later I started to appreciate, it's value in the

2:16:52.120 --> 2:17:02.920
 same way, let me ask you a ridiculous question, okay, I mean, because you've read our literature,

2:17:02.920 --> 2:17:09.800
 let me ask this one last question, I might be lying, there might be a couple more, but

2:17:09.800 --> 2:17:13.720
 what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:18.760
 You're, you got a Nobel Prize for looking out into the, trying to reach back into the

2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:25.280
 beginning of the universe, listening to the gravitational waves, but that still doesn't

2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:34.520
 answer the why, why are we here, beyond just the matter and anti matter, the philosophical

2:17:34.520 --> 2:17:35.520
 question.

2:17:35.520 --> 2:17:43.120
 The philosophical question about the meaning of life I'm probably not really good at, I

2:17:43.120 --> 2:17:56.600
 think that the individual meaning, I would say rather simplistically is whether you've

2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:05.200
 made a difference, a positive difference I'd say for anything besides yourself, meaning

2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:11.360
 you could have been important to other people or you could have discovered gravitational

2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:16.280
 waves that matters to other people or something, but something beyond just existing on the

2:18:16.280 --> 2:18:18.480
 earth as an individual.

2:18:18.480 --> 2:18:29.000
 So your life has meaning if you have affected either knowledge or people or something beyond

2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:30.000
 yourself.

2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:36.960
 That's a simplistic statement, but it's about as good as I am.

2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:42.520
 That may, in all of its simplicity, it may be very true.

2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:47.120
 Do you think about, does it make you sad that this ride ends?

2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:50.120
 Do you think about your mortality?

2:18:50.120 --> 2:18:51.120
 Yeah.

2:18:51.120 --> 2:18:55.320
 Are you afraid of it?

2:18:55.320 --> 2:19:06.480
 Not exactly afraid of it, but saddened by it and I'm old enough to know that I've lived

2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:12.720
 most of my life and I enjoy being alive.

2:19:12.720 --> 2:19:17.560
 I can imagine being sick and not wanting to be alive, but I'm not.

2:19:17.560 --> 2:19:35.600
 So I'm not happy to see it come to an end, I'd like to see it prolong, but I don't fear

2:19:35.600 --> 2:19:38.320
 the dying itself or that kind of thing.

2:19:38.320 --> 2:19:47.240
 It's more, I'd like to prolong what is, I think, a good life that I'm living and still

2:19:47.240 --> 2:19:48.240
 living.

2:19:48.240 --> 2:20:01.600
 It's sad to think that the finiteness of it is the thing that makes it special and also

2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:08.400
 sad to me, at least it's kind of, I don't think I'm using too strong of a word, but

2:20:08.400 --> 2:20:14.640
 it's kind of terrifying the uncertainty of it, the mystery of it.

2:20:14.640 --> 2:20:15.960
 The mystery of death.

2:20:15.960 --> 2:20:16.960
 The mystery of death.

2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:21.400
 When we're talking about the mystery of black holes that's somehow distant, that's somehow

2:20:21.400 --> 2:20:25.080
 out there, and the mystery of our own.

2:20:25.080 --> 2:20:30.440
 But even life, the mystery of consciousness I find so hard to deal with too.

2:20:30.440 --> 2:20:36.760
 I mean, it's not as painful, I mean, we're conscious, but the whole magic of life we

2:20:36.760 --> 2:20:42.680
 can understand but consciousness where we can actually think and so forth, it's pretty

2:20:42.680 --> 2:20:47.880
 it's such, it seems like such a beautiful gift that it really sucks that we get to let

2:20:47.880 --> 2:20:48.880
 go of it.

2:20:48.880 --> 2:20:49.880
 We'll have to let go of it.

2:20:49.880 --> 2:20:50.880
 Yeah.

2:20:50.880 --> 2:20:51.880
 What do you hope your legacy is?

2:20:51.880 --> 2:20:58.600
 As I'm sure they will, aliens when they visit and humans have destroyed all of human civilization,

2:20:58.600 --> 2:21:02.800
 aliens read about you in an encyclopedia that will leave behind, what do you hope it

2:21:02.800 --> 2:21:03.800
 says?

2:21:03.800 --> 2:21:12.360
 Well, I would hope they, to the extent that they evaluated me, felt that I helped move

2:21:12.360 --> 2:21:22.440
 science forward as a tangible contribution and that I served as a good role model for

2:21:22.440 --> 2:21:25.680
 how humans should live their lives.

2:21:25.680 --> 2:21:32.360
 And we're part of creating one of the most incredible things humans have ever created.

2:21:32.360 --> 2:21:35.720
 So yes, there's the science, that's the Fermi thing, right?

2:21:35.720 --> 2:21:36.720
 Yeah.

2:21:36.720 --> 2:21:38.240
 And the instrument, I guess.

2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:39.240
 And the instrument.

2:21:39.240 --> 2:21:44.960
 The instrument is a magical creation, not just by a human, by a collection of humans.

2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:54.720
 The collaboration is, that's humanity at its best.

2:21:54.720 --> 2:22:03.440
 I do hope, I do hope we last quite a bit longer, but if we don't, this is a good thing to remember

2:22:03.440 --> 2:22:07.440
 humans by, at least they built that thing.

2:22:07.440 --> 2:22:08.440
 That's pretty impressive.

2:22:08.440 --> 2:22:10.160
 Barry, this was an amazing conversation.

2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:14.320
 Thank you so much for wasting your time and explaining so many things so well.

2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:15.880
 I appreciate your time today.

2:22:15.880 --> 2:22:17.960
 Thank you.

2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:21.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Barry Barish.

2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:26.120
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:22:26.120 --> 2:22:31.440
 And now, let me leave you some words from Warner Heisenberg, a theoretical physicist

2:22:31.440 --> 2:22:35.800
 and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics.

2:22:35.800 --> 2:22:43.440
 Not only is the universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think.

2:22:43.440 --> 2:22:55.280
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
