00:00.000 --> 00:02.420
 How are these interacting with our fighters, if they are?

00:02.420 --> 00:03.780
 How are they interacting with the weather

00:03.780 --> 00:04.980
 and their environment?

00:04.980 --> 00:06.540
 How are they interacting with each other?

00:06.540 --> 00:07.700
 So can we look at these

00:07.700 --> 00:10.540
 and how they're interacting perhaps as a swarm?

00:10.540 --> 00:11.540
 Especially off the East Coast

00:11.540 --> 00:14.540
 where this is happening all the time with multiple objects.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.980
 The following is a conversation with Lieutenant Ryan Graves,

00:19.980 --> 00:22.020
 former Navy fighter pilot,

00:22.020 --> 00:24.100
 including Rose as a combat lead,

00:24.100 --> 00:28.500
 landing signals officer and rescue mission commander.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.220
 He and people in the squadron

00:30.220 --> 00:33.340
 detected UFOs on multiple occasions.

00:33.340 --> 00:35.940
 And he has been one of the few people

00:35.940 --> 00:38.660
 willing to speak publicly about these experiences

00:38.660 --> 00:42.300
 and about the importance of investigating these sightings,

00:42.300 --> 00:45.500
 especially for national security reasons.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.900
 Ryan has a degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering

00:48.900 --> 00:52.540
 from WPI and an interest in career roles

00:52.540 --> 00:54.460
 in advanced technology development,

00:54.460 --> 00:57.580
 including multi agent collaborative autonomy,

00:57.580 --> 01:00.180
 machine learning assisted air to air combat,

01:00.180 --> 01:03.260
 manned and unmanned teaming technologies,

01:03.260 --> 01:04.460
 and most recently,

01:04.460 --> 01:08.220
 development of materials through quantum simulation.

01:08.220 --> 01:10.260
 This is a Lex Freeman podcast.

01:10.260 --> 01:12.460
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:12.460 --> 01:13.820
 in the description.

01:13.820 --> 01:17.200
 And now dear friends, here's Ryan Graves.

01:18.220 --> 01:20.460
 What did you think of the new Top Gun movie?

01:20.460 --> 01:21.740
 How accurate was it?

01:21.740 --> 01:22.940
 Let's start there.

01:22.940 --> 01:25.660
 I thought the flying was really accurate.

01:25.660 --> 01:28.300
 I thought the type of flying they did

01:28.300 --> 01:30.340
 and how they approach the actual mission,

01:31.380 --> 01:33.420
 of course had a lot of liberties,

01:33.420 --> 01:35.540
 but one thing that seems to be hard to capture

01:35.540 --> 01:38.380
 on these types of things are the chess game that's going on

01:38.380 --> 01:40.420
 while that type of flying is happening.

01:40.420 --> 01:42.940
 The chess game between like in a dog fight

01:42.940 --> 01:45.580
 between the pilots and the enemy

01:45.580 --> 01:47.500
 or between the different pilots?

01:47.500 --> 01:49.540
 I'll even speak to just that particular mission.

01:49.540 --> 01:52.260
 They flew there and for that particular mission,

01:52.260 --> 01:55.020
 it's kind of a chess game with your shelf

01:55.020 --> 01:56.500
 to get everything in place.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.100
 So what kind of flight they flew

01:59.100 --> 02:00.860
 was called a high threat scenario,

02:00.860 --> 02:02.940
 which means they have to ingress low

02:02.940 --> 02:05.140
 due to the surface to air threats,

02:05.140 --> 02:08.060
 the integrated air defense systems that are nearby.

02:08.060 --> 02:09.740
 And they have to ingress low and pop up

02:09.740 --> 02:11.340
 like we see in the movie.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.940
 And in that particular movie, that was a preplanned strike.

02:13.940 --> 02:15.660
 They knew exactly where they're going.

02:15.660 --> 02:17.660
 But there's a scenario where we have to operate

02:17.660 --> 02:18.700
 in that type of environment

02:18.700 --> 02:20.740
 and we don't know exactly where we're gonna strike

02:20.740 --> 02:23.420
 or we're gonna be adapting to real time targets.

02:23.420 --> 02:25.300
 And so in that scenario, you would have one

02:25.300 --> 02:26.900
 of those fighters down low like that

02:26.900 --> 02:30.340
 operating as a mission commander, as a forward air controller.

02:30.340 --> 02:32.140
 And he's out there calling shots,

02:32.140 --> 02:33.540
 joining on those other players

02:33.540 --> 02:35.660
 in order to ensure they're pointed at the right target.

02:35.660 --> 02:38.780
 So that's a bit of the chess game that he'll be playing.

02:38.780 --> 02:40.180
 Can you actually describe for people

02:40.180 --> 02:43.460
 who haven't seen the movie what the mission actually is?

02:43.460 --> 02:44.300
 Yeah.

02:44.300 --> 02:45.140
 What's involved in the mission?

02:45.140 --> 02:47.260
 So in this particular mission,

02:47.260 --> 02:49.540
 it's kind of what we would call a preplanned strike.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.020
 So there's a known location.

02:51.020 --> 02:54.860
 That's in a heavily defended area in the air crew.

02:54.860 --> 02:57.420
 In this case, I believe it was four F18s

02:57.420 --> 02:59.540
 on the initial package.

02:59.540 --> 03:02.580
 Their job was to ingress very low down a canyon

03:02.580 --> 03:04.340
 to stay out of the radar window

03:04.340 --> 03:06.220
 of the surf to air threats.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.740
 What does ingress mean?

03:07.740 --> 03:09.740
 Ingress means that they're going to be pushing

03:09.740 --> 03:13.020
 from a start location towards the target or the objective.

03:13.020 --> 03:15.060
 So there's an ingress portion of the mission

03:15.060 --> 03:16.500
 and an egress portion of the mission.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.860
 Oh, okay.

03:18.860 --> 03:21.180
 Like the entrance and the exit type of thing.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.020
 Got it.

03:22.020 --> 03:24.540
 But it changes our mindset tactically quite a bit, right?

03:24.540 --> 03:26.020
 Because when we're entering someplace,

03:26.020 --> 03:27.900
 we have the option to enter.

03:27.900 --> 03:31.340
 But when we go drop a bomb on a location and we're exiting,

03:31.340 --> 03:32.820
 we don't have that luxury.

03:32.820 --> 03:33.780
 We don't have that option.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.420
 So it actually changes our tactics

03:35.420 --> 03:37.420
 and our aggression level.

03:37.420 --> 03:38.260
 Got it.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.340
 And so they were flying low to the ground

03:40.340 --> 03:43.820
 and then there's a surface to air missiles

03:43.820 --> 03:47.140
 that forced them to have to fly low.

03:47.140 --> 03:48.580
 Is that a realistic thing?

03:48.580 --> 03:49.740
 It is realistic.

03:49.740 --> 03:52.340
 So driving those aircraft in the clutter,

03:52.340 --> 03:54.900
 all radar systems or most I should say

03:54.900 --> 03:57.260
 are essentially line of sight.

03:57.260 --> 03:59.140
 And so they're going to be limited by the horizon

03:59.140 --> 04:00.660
 or any clutter out there.

04:00.660 --> 04:03.820
 And even a number of radars, if they are located up high

04:03.820 --> 04:06.660
 and looking down towards that aircraft,

04:06.660 --> 04:11.460
 the clutter or all the objects such as trees and canyons

04:11.460 --> 04:13.500
 can have effect on radar systems.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.300
 And so it can be a type of camouflage.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.820
 So that's a camouflage for the radar.

04:17.820 --> 04:21.180
 But what about the surface to air missile?

04:21.180 --> 04:24.260
 Is that a legitimate way to avoid missiles

04:24.260 --> 04:29.260
 as flies so low, like fly I guess below their level?

04:31.020 --> 04:34.460
 As far as I know, you can fly under any radar right now.

04:34.460 --> 04:36.180
 We don't have necessarily radars

04:36.180 --> 04:37.900
 that can look through anything.

04:37.900 --> 04:41.620
 So there is always going to be the ability to mask yourself.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.420
 But with a larger number of assets

04:43.420 --> 04:45.700
 and distributed communication networks,

04:45.700 --> 04:47.500
 where those radars are looking,

04:47.500 --> 04:48.460
 makes all the difference.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.980
 And I said they're ingressing pass and I ads

04:50.980 --> 04:52.940
 and that's an integrated air defense system.

04:52.940 --> 04:55.580
 And that linking of air defense systems

04:55.580 --> 04:58.940
 is what makes it so hard, so complicated

04:58.940 --> 05:01.780
 is that the sensors and the weapons are disassociated

05:01.780 --> 05:04.780
 from each other so that if you took out the target

05:04.780 --> 05:07.140
 that was shooting at you, it still has ability

05:07.140 --> 05:11.460
 to intercept you from another radar location.

05:11.460 --> 05:14.940
 So it's distributed and it's stronger that way.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.700
 You mean the surface to air missiles?

05:17.700 --> 05:20.860
 Like it's a distributed system

05:20.860 --> 05:22.700
 and that if you take out one,

05:22.700 --> 05:26.060
 they're still able to sort of integrate information

05:26.060 --> 05:28.300
 about your location and strike at you.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.140
 Correct.

05:29.140 --> 05:31.100
 And there's a lot of complication that can go,

05:31.100 --> 05:33.460
 once we start thinking about distributed systems like that

05:33.460 --> 05:35.500
 and the ability to self heal and repair

05:35.500 --> 05:39.900
 and adapt to losses, it's an interesting area.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.860
 Are you responsible for thinking about that

05:41.860 --> 05:43.460
 when you're flying an airplane?

05:43.460 --> 05:47.060
 To some degree, when we ingress to an area like that,

05:47.060 --> 05:50.060
 we're presented with information about targets,

05:50.060 --> 05:54.020
 air to air or air to surface or surface to air, I should say.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.700
 And we can essentially see where essentially

05:57.700 --> 06:00.420
 the danger zone, if you will, is located.

06:00.420 --> 06:02.340
 And so essentially we would stay out of that.

06:02.340 --> 06:05.860
 And so having a full picture of the environment

06:05.860 --> 06:08.460
 is extremely important because at the end of the day,

06:08.460 --> 06:10.500
 if we go in that circle, we can die pretty quickly.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.740
 So it's absolutely crucial.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.300
 So there's regions that have higher and lower danger

06:16.300 --> 06:17.900
 based on your understanding of the actual,

06:17.900 --> 06:22.060
 whatever the surface to air missiles systems are.

06:22.060 --> 06:24.220
 So you can kind of know.

06:24.220 --> 06:25.100
 That's interesting.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.940
 I wonder how automated that could be too,

06:26.940 --> 06:29.380
 especially when you don't know.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.300
 It seems like in the movie,

06:30.300 --> 06:32.100
 they knew the location of everything.

06:33.060 --> 06:37.460
 I imagine that's less known in most cases.

06:37.460 --> 06:40.140
 And also a lot of those systems might be

06:40.140 --> 06:43.580
 a little bit more ghetto if I can use that technical term.

06:43.580 --> 06:47.220
 Like I've gotten ad hoc maybe is the,

06:47.220 --> 06:49.300
 I don't know.

06:49.300 --> 06:52.340
 But having just recently visited Ukraine

06:52.340 --> 06:55.340
 and seen a lot of aspects of the way that war is fought,

06:55.340 --> 06:58.100
 there's a lot of improvised type of systems.

06:58.100 --> 07:01.900
 So you take high tech, like advanced technology,

07:01.900 --> 07:04.260
 but the way you deploy it and the way you organize it

07:04.260 --> 07:07.620
 is very improvised and ad hoc

07:07.620 --> 07:10.380
 and is responding to the uncertainty in the dynamic

07:10.380 --> 07:11.220
 environment.

07:11.220 --> 07:15.180
 And so from an enemy perspective or whoever's trying to deal

07:15.180 --> 07:17.820
 with that kind of system, it's hard to figure it out

07:17.820 --> 07:22.020
 because it's like me, I played tennis for a long time

07:22.020 --> 07:24.020
 and it's always easier to play.

07:24.020 --> 07:25.780
 This is true for all sports.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.340
 Play tennis against a good tennis player

07:27.340 --> 07:29.180
 versus a crappy tennis player.

07:29.180 --> 07:32.460
 Because the crappy tennis player is full of uncertainty.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.300
 And that's really difficult to deal with.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.420
 It seemed like in the movie,

07:35.420 --> 07:38.940
 the systems were really well organized.

07:38.940 --> 07:40.900
 And so you could plan.

07:40.900 --> 07:41.940
 And there was a very nice ravine

07:41.940 --> 07:43.380
 that went right down the middle of them.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.820
 That's how movies work, isn't it?

07:44.820 --> 07:45.660
 Yeah.

07:45.660 --> 07:47.300
 But no, I absolutely agree.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.580
 So what you say is a very good point.

07:50.580 --> 07:54.540
 And if we were to take a chunk of airspace

07:54.540 --> 07:56.340
 and break it up into little bits,

07:56.340 --> 07:58.060
 there'd be places that are better to fly

07:58.060 --> 08:00.220
 or less good to fly.

08:00.220 --> 08:02.620
 And we are seeing that now

08:02.620 --> 08:05.300
 with what they call manned on man teaming,

08:05.300 --> 08:06.620
 we see tactical aircraft

08:06.620 --> 08:09.180
 or some type of aircraft or platform

08:09.180 --> 08:11.140
 that's being automated.

08:11.140 --> 08:13.580
 And it's not being automated in traditional sense

08:13.580 --> 08:15.540
 where people think aircrew are flying them around

08:15.540 --> 08:16.380
 to conduct missions,

08:16.380 --> 08:20.220
 but it's very high level objective orientated

08:20.220 --> 08:22.620
 mission planning that allows the aircrew

08:22.620 --> 08:26.540
 to act more as a mission commander

08:26.540 --> 08:28.580
 versus having to just pick the right assets

08:28.580 --> 08:33.580
 or fly them around or manipulate them somewhat physically.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.020
 So actually going back to the chess thing,

08:36.020 --> 08:37.460
 can you elaborate on what you mean

08:37.460 --> 08:40.220
 as playing a game of chess with yourself?

08:40.220 --> 08:42.340
 What's, when you're flying that mission,

08:42.340 --> 08:43.740
 what exactly do you mean by that?

08:43.740 --> 08:44.820
 Well, there's a few people

08:44.820 --> 08:46.620
 you're usually fighting against in the air.

08:46.620 --> 08:48.140
 You know, there's the bad guys

08:48.140 --> 08:52.300
 and then there's physics and mother nature, right?

08:52.300 --> 08:56.460
 So when we're down at about a hundred feet,

08:56.460 --> 08:58.620
 it's a chess game to stay alive for the pilot

08:58.620 --> 09:00.220
 and it's a chess game for the WISO

09:00.220 --> 09:02.620
 to process the information he needs

09:02.620 --> 09:04.900
 and then communicate it to all those other aircraft

09:04.900 --> 09:06.460
 that were flying around to ensure

09:06.460 --> 09:08.420
 that they're putting their weapons on the right target.

09:08.420 --> 09:09.540
 What's the WISO?

09:09.540 --> 09:11.380
 WISO is a weapon systems officer.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.620
 He's a backseater who is not a pilot,

09:13.620 --> 09:16.020
 but they're responsible for radar manipulation

09:16.020 --> 09:19.100
 and communications and weapons appointments

09:19.100 --> 09:19.940
 of certain natures.

09:19.940 --> 09:22.140
 So the chess game is against physics,

09:22.140 --> 09:23.220
 against the enemy.

09:24.540 --> 09:25.780
 Time.

09:25.780 --> 09:26.700
 Time.

09:26.700 --> 09:31.180
 What about your own psychology, fear, uncertainty?

09:31.180 --> 09:32.020
 No.

09:32.020 --> 09:35.300
 No, there's no time for that type of self reflection

09:35.300 --> 09:36.300
 while we're flying.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.540
 I wanna get to that,

09:39.540 --> 09:41.980
 but I don't wanna forget the point that you made

09:41.980 --> 09:45.500
 about increased randomness being a tactical advantage.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.900
 You know, as you mentioned,

09:47.900 --> 09:49.780
 you can introduce autonomy in there

09:49.780 --> 09:51.940
 and when you bring autonomy in there

09:51.940 --> 09:53.340
 and my expectation would be

09:53.340 --> 09:55.820
 as we bring different abilities and machine learning

09:55.820 --> 09:57.540
 as we gather more data,

09:57.540 --> 10:00.700
 we're gonna be able to bring the tactical environment

10:00.700 --> 10:01.540
 around that jet.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.140
 The war space that it goes into

10:03.140 --> 10:04.980
 will almost be at a stochastic level

10:04.980 --> 10:06.140
 from the enemy's perspective

10:06.140 --> 10:08.100
 where it'll almost seem like

10:08.100 --> 10:09.780
 every tactical environment they go in

10:09.780 --> 10:11.700
 will be random and yet very deadly

10:11.700 --> 10:13.980
 because the system is providing

10:13.980 --> 10:17.580
 a new tactical solution essentially

10:17.580 --> 10:18.980
 for that particular scenario

10:18.980 --> 10:21.900
 instead of just training two particular tactics

10:21.900 --> 10:24.900
 that have to be repeatable and trainable and lethal, right?

10:24.900 --> 10:26.300
 But not necessarily the most lethal

10:26.300 --> 10:28.260
 because they have to be trainable.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.860
 But if we can introduce AI into that

10:29.860 --> 10:32.820
 and to have a level of randomness

10:32.820 --> 10:34.100
 or at least the appearance of randomness

10:34.100 --> 10:35.180
 due to the complexity,

10:36.140 --> 10:39.140
 I would consider it like a stochastic tactical advantage

10:39.140 --> 10:40.580
 because even our own blue fighters

10:40.580 --> 10:41.940
 wouldn't be able to engage in that fight

10:41.940 --> 10:45.660
 because it would be unsafe essentially for anything else.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.580
 And I think that's where we have to drive to

10:47.580 --> 10:49.860
 because otherwise it's always this chicken and mouse cat game

10:49.860 --> 10:51.940
 about who's tactics and who knows what.

10:51.940 --> 10:54.700
 But if knowledge is no longer a factor,

10:54.700 --> 10:56.460
 it's gonna make things a lot different.

10:56.460 --> 11:00.020
 That's really interesting, so out of the many things

11:01.300 --> 11:04.660
 that are part of your expertise, your journey,

11:04.660 --> 11:08.260
 you're also working on autonomous and semi autonomous systems,

11:08.260 --> 11:09.620
 the use of AI, machine learning,

11:09.620 --> 11:12.140
 and man to man teaming, all that kind of stuff.

11:12.140 --> 11:15.980
 We'll talk about it, but you're saying

11:15.980 --> 11:19.500
 sort of when people think about the use of AI in war,

11:19.500 --> 11:22.140
 in military systems, they think about like

11:22.140 --> 11:23.940
 computer vision for perception

11:23.940 --> 11:26.700
 or processing of sensor information

11:26.700 --> 11:29.700
 in order to extract from it actionable knowledge

11:29.700 --> 11:32.300
 kind of thing, but you're saying you could also use it

11:32.300 --> 11:37.300
 to generate randomness that's difficult to work with

11:37.740 --> 11:39.900
 in like a game theoretic way.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.540
 Like it's difficult for human operators to respond to.

11:43.540 --> 11:44.460
 Exactly.

11:44.460 --> 11:45.460
 That's really interesting.

11:45.460 --> 11:48.740
 Okay, so back to Tom Cruise and Top Gun.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.420
 What about the dog fighting?

11:51.420 --> 11:53.660
 What aspects of that were accurate?

11:53.660 --> 11:58.140
 So dog fighting is kind of an interesting conversation

11:58.140 --> 12:01.020
 because it's not the most tactically relevant skill set

12:01.020 --> 12:03.660
 nowadays by traditional standards

12:03.660 --> 12:06.060
 because the ranges with which we engage

12:06.060 --> 12:09.260
 and deploy weapons are very significant.

12:09.260 --> 12:12.580
 And so if we're in a scenario, we're in a dog fight like that,

12:14.020 --> 12:15.580
 a lot of things have probably gone wrong, right?

12:15.580 --> 12:17.860
 And that's kind of how this mission was set up, right?

12:17.860 --> 12:20.820
 It was a no win type scenario, most likely.

12:20.820 --> 12:23.420
 And so for a dog fight, the aircraft size

12:23.420 --> 12:25.420
 and the ranges and the turn radiuses make it

12:25.420 --> 12:27.420
 so it's not very theatrical, right?

12:27.420 --> 12:29.620
 The aircraft looks small and while it's intense

12:29.620 --> 12:31.820
 with the systems I have and the sensors

12:31.820 --> 12:33.820
 and what I'm feeling and all that,

12:33.820 --> 12:35.820
 we've done it and we've done it, right?

12:35.820 --> 12:38.020
 We take video of that and it's just like a blue sky

12:38.020 --> 12:39.220
 and you see a little dot out there.

12:39.220 --> 12:40.220
 So not very interesting.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.220
 And so anytime it really looks interesting

12:42.220 --> 12:45.820
 in dog fight arena, that's most likely a fiction

12:45.820 --> 12:48.420
 because we really only get close for a millisecond

12:48.420 --> 12:50.420
 as we're dipping past each other at the merge.

12:50.420 --> 12:51.620
 You're breaking my heart, right?

12:51.620 --> 12:52.420
 I know, I'm sorry.

12:52.420 --> 12:53.820
 You're breaking my heart.

12:53.820 --> 12:54.820
 No, I understand.

12:54.820 --> 12:57.820
 You can go out and have fun, but in a dog fight specifically.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.820
 Maybe that was more common in the earlier wars of World War II

13:00.820 --> 13:05.820
 and before that, where the, is it due to the range

13:05.820 --> 13:08.820
 and the effectiveness of the weapons systems involved?

13:08.820 --> 13:12.220
 Correct, and the accuracy of the targeting systems at range.

13:12.220 --> 13:14.820
 But there's also a train of thought

13:14.820 --> 13:16.420
 that hasn't necessarily been tested out yet,

13:16.420 --> 13:21.420
 which is with the advent of advanced electronic warfare,

13:21.420 --> 13:27.420
 EW and or unmanned assets, the battle space may get so complex

13:27.420 --> 13:31.420
 and missiles may essentially just get dropped out of the sky

13:31.420 --> 13:34.420
 or wasted such that you're going to be in close

13:34.420 --> 13:36.420
 with either IR missiles or guns.

13:36.420 --> 13:40.420
 If it's a no kidding, you know, must defend type scenario.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.420
 First of all, what's electronic warfare?

13:42.420 --> 13:44.420
 You know, it's basically trying to get control

13:44.420 --> 13:47.420
 of electromagnetic spectrum for the interest

13:47.420 --> 13:50.420
 of whatever operation is going on.

13:50.420 --> 13:51.420
 So in the tactical environment,

13:51.420 --> 13:53.420
 a lot of that is trying to deceive the radar

13:53.420 --> 13:56.420
 or can we deceive the missile or just, you know, stop their guide

13:56.420 --> 13:58.420
 and things of that nature.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.420
 Man, it's a battle in the space of information,

14:01.420 --> 14:03.420
 of digital information.

14:03.420 --> 14:05.420
 Yeah, well, F 22 and F 35, right?

14:05.420 --> 14:07.420
 F 22 is a big expensive aircraft

14:07.420 --> 14:09.420
 and it was made to be a great fighter.

14:09.420 --> 14:12.420
 But the F 35 is not as great of a fighter,

14:12.420 --> 14:14.420
 but it's an electronic warfare

14:14.420 --> 14:18.420
 and mission commander platform of the future

14:18.420 --> 14:20.420
 where information is what's going to win the war

14:20.420 --> 14:22.420
 instead of the best dogfighter.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.420
 And so it's interesting dichotomy there.

14:24.420 --> 14:27.420
 What's the best airplane ever made, fighter jet ever made?

14:27.420 --> 14:29.420
 I know the aviators in the audience

14:29.420 --> 14:31.420
 are going to hate my answer

14:31.420 --> 14:33.420
 because they're going to want that sexy, you know,

14:33.420 --> 14:36.420
 muscly F 14 Tomcat type fighter

14:36.420 --> 14:39.420
 or maybe P 51 type aircraft.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.420
 The F 35 is maybe not the best dogfighter,

14:43.420 --> 14:45.420
 but it doesn't have to get in a dogfight, right?

14:45.420 --> 14:47.420
 It's like how you'd be the best knife fighters

14:47.420 --> 14:49.420
 not getting a knife fight sometimes.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.420
 Locky Martin F 35 Lightning II.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.420
 It looks pretty sexy.

14:53.420 --> 14:55.420
 There's two real strengths you can have as a fighter.

14:55.420 --> 14:58.420
 You can have the ability to kind of outmuscle your fighter,

14:58.420 --> 15:02.420
 your opponent and beat them on Gs and power

15:02.420 --> 15:03.420
 and rate around on them.

15:03.420 --> 15:05.420
 And then there's the other side of that,

15:05.420 --> 15:08.420
 which is you can be overly maneuverable.

15:08.420 --> 15:10.420
 You can bleed energy quickly.

15:10.420 --> 15:12.420
 And that's what the F 18 was good at

15:12.420 --> 15:15.420
 because it had to be heavier to land on aircraft carrier.

15:15.420 --> 15:17.420
 We had to give it extra bulk,

15:17.420 --> 15:19.420
 but it also needs special mechanisms

15:19.420 --> 15:21.420
 to slow down enough to land on aircraft carrier.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.420
 And so it made it very maneuverable.

15:22.420 --> 15:24.420
 And what that leads to a lot of times,

15:24.420 --> 15:27.420
 the ability to get maybe the first shot in a fight,

15:27.420 --> 15:30.420
 which is very good, but if you do make that sharp turn,

15:30.420 --> 15:32.420
 you're going to bleed a lot of your energy away

15:32.420 --> 15:34.420
 and be more susceptible for follow on shots

15:34.420 --> 15:35.420
 if that one's less susceptible.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.420
 And so there's just kind of aggression,

15:37.420 --> 15:40.420
 game you can play depending on the type of aircraft you're fighting.

15:40.420 --> 15:43.420
 Where does the F 35 land on that spectrum?

15:43.420 --> 15:46.420
 The F 35 land somewhere behind the F 22s.

15:46.420 --> 15:49.420
 So there'll probably be a row of F 22s or F 18s

15:49.420 --> 15:50.420
 and F 35 will be out back,

15:50.420 --> 15:52.420
 but it'll be enabling a lot of the warfare

15:52.420 --> 15:53.420
 that's happening in front of you.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.420
 Is it one of the more expensive planes

15:55.420 --> 15:57.420
 because of all the stuff on it?

15:57.420 --> 15:59.420
 It certainly is, yeah.

15:59.420 --> 16:03.420
 In the movie, they have Tom Cruise fly it over Mach 10.

16:03.420 --> 16:07.420
 So maybe can you say what are the different speeds?

16:07.420 --> 16:12.420
 Accelerations feel like Mach 1, 2, 3, or hypersonic?

16:12.420 --> 16:14.420
 Have you ever flown hypersonic?

16:14.420 --> 16:15.420
 No.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.420
 How tough does it get?

16:17.420 --> 16:20.420
 I'm just going to call out the BS of ejecting at Mach 10,

16:20.420 --> 16:22.420
 just for the record, because in the movie,

16:22.420 --> 16:26.420
 there's been, I think, at least one ejection that was supersonic.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.420
 And I'll just say, it was not pretty, but he survived.

16:29.420 --> 16:32.420
 So there's going to have to be some interesting mechanisms

16:32.420 --> 16:34.420
 to eject successfully at Mach 10,

16:34.420 --> 16:36.420
 but I'll digress on that for the moment.

16:36.420 --> 16:37.420
 Yeah, that seemed very strange.

16:37.420 --> 16:38.420
 And he just walked away from it.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.420
 But anyway, so, you know...

16:40.420 --> 16:41.420
 He seemed disheveled.

16:41.420 --> 16:45.420
 Okay, but it's Tom Cruise.

16:45.420 --> 16:47.420
 You know, it's like Chuck Norris or something.

16:47.420 --> 16:48.420
 Indestructible, yeah.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.420
 Indestructible.

16:49.420 --> 16:50.420
 That's what I was in age.

16:50.420 --> 16:51.420
 Yeah.

16:51.420 --> 16:56.420
 But anyway, so what's interesting to say about the experience

16:56.420 --> 16:58.420
 of it as you go up?

16:58.420 --> 17:00.420
 Does it get more and more difficult?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.420
 In the end of the day, crossing the soundbearer is much like

17:02.420 --> 17:04.420
 crossing the speed limit on the highway.

17:04.420 --> 17:06.420
 You don't really notice anything.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.420
 To cross that, at least in F18,

17:08.420 --> 17:10.420
 because we have a lot more weight than most fighters,

17:10.420 --> 17:12.420
 is typically we'll do that in a descent.

17:12.420 --> 17:14.420
 And we'll do that full afterburner,

17:14.420 --> 17:17.420
 just dumping gas into the engine.

17:17.420 --> 17:20.420
 And so that'll get us over as fast as I think I've gone

17:20.420 --> 17:21.420
 with about 1.28.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.420
 But what's interesting, people realize,

17:23.420 --> 17:26.420
 is that if I take that throttle and I'm an afterburner

17:26.420 --> 17:28.420
 and I just bring it back to mill,

17:28.420 --> 17:31.420
 which is full power, just not afterburner,

17:31.420 --> 17:34.420
 the deceleration is so strong due to the air friction

17:34.420 --> 17:36.420
 that it throw you forward in your straps.

17:36.420 --> 17:38.420
 Almost, you know, I would say, you know,

17:38.420 --> 17:41.420
 maybe like 70% as strong almost as trapping on the boat.

17:41.420 --> 17:42.420
 It's pretty strong.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.420
 So it's almost like reverse car crashes

17:44.420 --> 17:45.420
 for the deceleration.

17:45.420 --> 17:47.420
 So the acceleration, you know, is usually kind of slow

17:47.420 --> 17:49.420
 and you don't feel anything, of course,

17:49.420 --> 17:50.420
 when you're crossing through it,

17:50.420 --> 17:53.420
 but the deceleration is pretty violent.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.420
 The deceleration is violent, huh?

17:55.420 --> 17:56.420
 Okay.

17:56.420 --> 18:00.420
 But is there a fundamental difference between like Mach 1

18:00.420 --> 18:03.420
 and Hypersonic, Mach 5, and so on?

18:03.420 --> 18:05.420
 Does it require like super special training?

18:05.420 --> 18:09.420
 And is that something that's used often in warfare

18:09.420 --> 18:10.420
 or is it not really that necessary?

18:10.420 --> 18:11.420
 No.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.420
 So Hypersonic human flight, if it exists,

18:13.420 --> 18:15.420
 it's not something that's employed tactically

18:15.420 --> 18:18.420
 in any sense right now that I'm aware of.

18:18.420 --> 18:22.420
 So, you know, I think of Hypersonic technology,

18:22.420 --> 18:25.420
 I think of missiles and weapons systems

18:25.420 --> 18:26.420
 and delivery platform.

18:26.420 --> 18:29.420
 I don't think of fighter aircraft necessarily.

18:29.420 --> 18:33.420
 I can think of bomber or reconnaissance aircraft, perhaps,

18:33.420 --> 18:36.420
 but those would be more efficient, very long, long range.

18:36.420 --> 18:39.420
 I imagine the acceleration would be kind of gentle, honestly.

18:39.420 --> 18:42.420
 The thing you experience is the acceleration

18:42.420 --> 18:44.420
 on the actual speed.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.420
 There's been just a small tangent,

18:46.420 --> 18:49.420
 a lot of discussion about Hypersonic nuclear weapons,

18:49.420 --> 18:54.420
 like missiles from, you know, Russia bragging about that.

18:54.420 --> 18:56.420
 Is this something that's a significant concern

18:56.420 --> 19:00.420
 or is it just a way to flex about different kinds of weapons systems?

19:00.420 --> 19:05.420
 Hypersonics, I do think, pose a challenge for our detection systems

19:05.420 --> 19:08.420
 because there are, you know,

19:08.420 --> 19:11.420
 there are design considerations in these sensor systems,

19:11.420 --> 19:12.420
 as always, right?

19:12.420 --> 19:14.420
 And when you build them and the technology progresses

19:14.420 --> 19:17.420
 to a point where maybe it's not feasible to use that technology,

19:17.420 --> 19:18.420
 you know, there's a problem.

19:18.420 --> 19:21.420
 But with the, you know, the all domain

19:21.420 --> 19:24.420
 data linking capabilities we have,

19:24.420 --> 19:29.420
 it's less of, you know, it's a more of an integrated picture, I'll say.

19:29.420 --> 19:34.420
 And so the Hypersonics are really what it is,

19:34.420 --> 19:36.420
 is how fast can we detect and destroy a problem?

19:36.420 --> 19:38.420
 You're just shortening the time available to do that.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.420
 We call it something like that the kill chain, right?

19:40.420 --> 19:44.420
 It's from locating a target and identifying it

19:44.420 --> 19:47.420
 and, you know, essentially authorizing its destruction

19:47.420 --> 19:51.420
 by whatever means employing and then actually following up

19:51.420 --> 19:54.420
 to ensure that you did what you said you were going to do in some sense, right?

19:54.420 --> 19:56.420
 Does it need another reattack, something of that nature?

19:56.420 --> 20:00.420
 And so there's an old dogfighting framework you could call it.

20:00.420 --> 20:01.420
 It's called the Udalloop.

20:01.420 --> 20:04.420
 It kind of made its way in the engineering of business now,

20:04.420 --> 20:08.420
 but the old Observe Orientate Decide Act was initially a fighter mechanism

20:08.420 --> 20:11.420
 in order to get inside that kill chain of your opponent

20:11.420 --> 20:16.420
 and break it up so that he can't process his kill chain on you.

20:16.420 --> 20:19.420
 And so Hypersonics are a way of shortening those windows

20:19.420 --> 20:22.420
 of opportunity to react to that.

20:22.420 --> 20:25.420
 I wanted to, like, how much do you have to shorten it

20:25.420 --> 20:29.420
 in order for the defense systems not to work anymore?

20:29.420 --> 20:34.420
 It seems like, you know, I'm both often horrified

20:34.420 --> 20:36.420
 by the thought of nuclear war,

20:36.420 --> 20:41.420
 but at the same time wonder what that looks like.

20:41.420 --> 20:45.420
 When I dream of extreme competence in defense systems,

20:45.420 --> 20:48.420
 I imagine that not a single nuclear weapon

20:48.420 --> 20:53.420
 can reach the United States by missile with the defense systems.

20:53.420 --> 20:58.420
 But then again, I also understand that these are extremely complicated systems,

20:58.420 --> 21:00.420
 the amount of integration required,

21:00.420 --> 21:03.420
 and because you're not using them,

21:03.420 --> 21:09.420
 there could be, you know, there's like an intern somewhere

21:09.420 --> 21:11.420
 that, like, forgot to update the code,

21:11.420 --> 21:14.420
 the Fortran code that, like, is going to make the difference.

21:14.420 --> 21:18.420
 Because you don't have the opportunity to really thoroughly test,

21:18.420 --> 21:21.420
 which is really scary.

21:21.420 --> 21:23.420
 Of course, the systems are probably incredible

21:23.420 --> 21:25.420
 if they could be tested,

21:25.420 --> 21:27.420
 but because they can't be really thoroughly tested

21:27.420 --> 21:32.420
 in an actual attack, I wonder.

21:32.420 --> 21:35.420
 I guess one assumption there would be that

21:35.420 --> 21:37.420
 these Hypersonic missiles would only be launched

21:37.420 --> 21:39.420
 in the case of an attack.

21:39.420 --> 21:41.420
 It'd be interesting if there were other Hypersonic objects

21:41.420 --> 21:44.420
 that we could use to flex those systems.

21:44.420 --> 21:46.420
 Another thing that actually happened,

21:46.420 --> 21:48.420
 I just have a million questions I want to ask you.

21:48.420 --> 21:50.420
 It's fascinating to me.

21:50.420 --> 21:52.420
 Is there's a bird strike on the plane?

21:52.420 --> 21:53.420
 Does that happen often?

21:53.420 --> 21:54.420
 Yeah, it's a serious issue.

21:54.420 --> 21:55.420
 It damaged the engine,

21:55.420 --> 21:59.420
 and they made it seem like it's a serious, exactly a serious issue.

21:59.420 --> 22:00.420
 I've hit birds.

22:00.420 --> 22:04.420
 I know someone that took a turkey vulture to the face

22:04.420 --> 22:05.420
 through the cockpit, right?

22:05.420 --> 22:08.420
 Shattered the cockpit, knocked them out.

22:08.420 --> 22:11.420
 Actually, I don't know personally about this story.

22:11.420 --> 22:13.420
 I know from the command I was at,

22:13.420 --> 22:15.420
 and I believe the backseater had to punch out

22:15.420 --> 22:17.420
 and punch them both out because he was unconscious

22:17.420 --> 22:19.420
 in the front seat from the bird.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.420
 It can kill you from hitting you.

22:21.420 --> 22:25.420
 It's like a bowling ball going 250 miles an hour.

22:25.420 --> 22:30.420
 It can take out an engine very easily.

22:30.420 --> 22:32.420
 Every airport I've flown at in the Navy,

22:32.420 --> 22:35.420
 I've had to check the bird condition, if you will,

22:35.420 --> 22:37.420
 to see how many birds.

22:37.420 --> 22:39.420
 We've had to cancel flights because there's too many of them

22:39.420 --> 22:40.420
 around the airport.

22:40.420 --> 22:42.420
 Some airports even have bird radars, military airports.

22:42.420 --> 22:45.420
 Is there systems that monitor the bird condition?

22:45.420 --> 22:46.420
 There is, yeah.

22:46.420 --> 22:47.420
 There's actual radar systems,

22:47.420 --> 22:50.420
 and you can go in the certain bases,

22:50.420 --> 22:52.420
 you have to call up and they'll tell you what it is for the day

22:52.420 --> 22:53.420
 or for that hour,

22:53.420 --> 22:55.420
 and other ones have it in their weather report

22:55.420 --> 22:58.420
 that goes out with the radio.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.420
 What are some technological solutions to this?

23:00.420 --> 23:05.420
 Or is this just because it's a low probability event,

23:05.420 --> 23:07.420
 there's no real solution for it?

23:07.420 --> 23:09.420
 I would say it's not a low probability event.

23:09.420 --> 23:11.420
 This is happening a lot.

23:11.420 --> 23:14.420
 Although the hits themselves aren't necessarily that common,

23:14.420 --> 23:16.420
 or I'll say a catastrophic hit,

23:16.420 --> 23:18.420
 either a near miss or a hit,

23:18.420 --> 23:21.420
 or the pilot having to actively maneuver to avoid it,

23:21.420 --> 23:23.420
 it's pretty common.

23:23.420 --> 23:24.420
 It seems stressful.

23:24.420 --> 23:25.420
 It is.

23:25.420 --> 23:29.420
 It's so common in fact that we know that you never want to go under a bird

23:29.420 --> 23:31.420
 if you see it in front of you.

23:31.420 --> 23:32.420
 You always want to try to go over it

23:32.420 --> 23:34.420
 because what they'll do immediately if they see you

23:34.420 --> 23:36.420
 and you startle them is they'll bring their wings in

23:36.420 --> 23:38.420
 and just drop straight down to try to get out of the path.

23:38.420 --> 23:39.420
 It's interesting.

23:39.420 --> 23:40.420
 I didn't know they did that,

23:40.420 --> 23:42.420
 but if you try to go under them,

23:42.420 --> 23:44.420
 they're going to be dropping into you.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.420
 So you typically want to try to go above them.

23:45.420 --> 23:48.420
 Is this something you can train for or no?

23:48.420 --> 23:50.420
 Is this one of those things you have to really experience?

23:50.420 --> 23:54.420
 It's a skill set that you somewhat train for

23:54.420 --> 23:57.420
 in the duties of being a fighter pilot in a sense, right?

23:57.420 --> 23:59.420
 Being able to react to your environment very quickly

23:59.420 --> 24:01.420
 and make decisions quickly.

24:01.420 --> 24:04.420
 Is that one of the more absurd things,

24:04.420 --> 24:06.420
 challenges you have to deal with in flying?

24:06.420 --> 24:10.420
 Is there other things sort of maybe weather conditions,

24:10.420 --> 24:11.420
 like harsh weather conditions?

24:11.420 --> 24:14.420
 Is there something that we maybe don't often think about

24:14.420 --> 24:17.420
 in terms of the challenges of flying?

24:17.420 --> 24:20.420
 Birds in a way aren't a ridiculous threat for us.

24:20.420 --> 24:25.420
 It's a safety threat that anything physical in the air

24:25.420 --> 24:27.420
 is something that we really have to be careful about,

24:27.420 --> 24:30.420
 whether we're flying formation off of the aircraft right next to us

24:30.420 --> 24:33.420
 or whether it's a turkey vulture at 2,000 feet

24:33.420 --> 24:36.420
 or a flock of 5,000 birds like at the runway,

24:36.420 --> 24:38.420
 we have to wave off, you know?

24:38.420 --> 24:40.420
 And although there are low probability,

24:40.420 --> 24:42.420
 a lot of bases will have like actual environmental

24:42.420 --> 24:45.420
 protecting agency employees that are responsible

24:45.420 --> 24:49.420
 for safely removing migratory birds or different animals

24:49.420 --> 24:53.420
 that may be in the runways or flying about.

24:53.420 --> 24:55.420
 Wow, I didn't know what a turkey vulture is

24:55.420 --> 24:59.420
 and it really does look like a mix between a vulture and a turkey.

24:59.420 --> 25:03.420
 And look kind of dumb, no offense to turkey vultures.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.420
 In that movie, who was the enemy nation?

25:08.420 --> 25:16.420
 Was it, I mean, I guess they were implying it's Iran or was it Russia?

25:16.420 --> 25:19.420
 I didn't think they were implying any particular nation state, frankly.

25:19.420 --> 25:24.420
 I think they did a somewhat decent job of having some ambiguous

25:24.420 --> 25:30.420
 5th generation fighters, the location and the stockpile.

25:30.420 --> 25:33.420
 I get like how the story kind of insinuates certain things,

25:33.420 --> 25:35.420
 but they seem to do a good job of not having anything

25:35.420 --> 25:38.420
 directly pointing to another nation, which I thought was, you know, the good move.

25:38.420 --> 25:44.420
 I enjoy these type of movies as an aviator and, you know, as an American, right?

25:44.420 --> 25:48.420
 Because it's a feel good movie, but, you know, we shouldn't be celebrating

25:48.420 --> 25:51.420
 going to war with any particular country, you know, China, Russia,

25:51.420 --> 25:54.420
 wherever may have these weapons. It's fun to watch, but it would be

25:54.420 --> 25:57.420
 an incredibly serious event to be employing these weapons.

25:57.420 --> 26:00.420
 Yeah, and we'll talk about war in general.

26:00.420 --> 26:06.420
 Because yeah, it's the movies kind of celebrating the human side of things

26:06.420 --> 26:12.420
 and also the incredible technology involved, but there's also the cost of war

26:12.420 --> 26:15.420
 and the seriousness of war and the suffering involved with war,

26:15.420 --> 26:20.420
 not just in the fighting, but in the death of civilians and all those kinds of things.

26:20.420 --> 26:26.420
 Well, you were a Navy pilot. Let's talk a little bit more seriously about this.

26:26.420 --> 26:31.420
 And you were twice deployed in the Middle East, flying the FAA 18F Super Hornet.

26:31.420 --> 26:35.420
 Can you briefly tell the story of your career as a Navy pilot?

26:35.420 --> 26:39.420
 Sure. So I joined the Navy in 2009, right after college.

26:39.420 --> 26:43.420
 I went to, essentially, the officer boot camp, officer candidate school.

26:43.420 --> 26:46.420
 I applied as a pilot and I got in as a pilot.

26:46.420 --> 26:50.420
 That was advantage of going that way is that I essentially choose what I wanted

26:50.420 --> 26:53.420
 and if I got in great, if not, I didn't get stuck doing something else.

26:53.420 --> 26:55.420
 So you knew you wanted to be a pilot?

26:55.420 --> 26:58.420
 I did. I joined. I went through my initial training.

26:58.420 --> 27:02.420
 I went through primary flight training that all aviators go through.

27:02.420 --> 27:07.420
 And I did well enough that, you know, one of the first lessons I teach you in the Navy is that,

27:07.420 --> 27:10.420
 you know, you can have a great career in the Navy and you can, you know,

27:10.420 --> 27:12.420
 see the world and do what you want.

27:12.420 --> 27:15.420
 But at the end of the day, it's all about the needs of the Navy and what they need.

27:15.420 --> 27:18.420
 So, you know, they may not have the platform you like or, you know,

27:18.420 --> 27:21.420
 you may not necessarily get to choose your own adventure here.

27:21.420 --> 27:25.420
 But I was lucky enough that there was one jet slot in my class

27:25.420 --> 27:27.420
 and I was lucky enough, fortunate enough to get it.

27:27.420 --> 27:29.420
 So it was a jet slot.

27:29.420 --> 27:33.420
 So yeah, what that means is that I was assigned actually a tail hook at that point,

27:33.420 --> 27:38.420
 which meant I would go trained to fly aircraft that land on aircraft carriers.

27:38.420 --> 27:42.420
 And there's essentially three aircraft that do that at the time.

27:42.420 --> 27:48.420
 There's the F18 and the E2 and the C2.

27:48.420 --> 27:50.420
 C2 is kind of like the mail truck for the boat.

27:50.420 --> 27:53.420
 E2 is one of the big radar dish on top.

27:53.420 --> 27:55.420
 And then there's all the F18s.

27:55.420 --> 27:59.420
 So E2's comms the C2 mail truck?

27:59.420 --> 28:00.420
 Yeah.

28:00.420 --> 28:02.420
 C2 basically goes to the mail.

28:02.420 --> 28:07.420
 They back on the shore and they're the ones that bring supplies to the ship via air and people.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.420
 Sorry if I missed it.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.420
 Is it a plane or is it a helicopter?

28:09.420 --> 28:10.420
 It's a plane.

28:10.420 --> 28:11.420
 Okay.

28:11.420 --> 28:12.420
 All right.

28:12.420 --> 28:13.420
 And the F18 is a fighter jet?

28:13.420 --> 28:14.420
 Correct.

28:14.420 --> 28:15.420
 Okay.

28:15.420 --> 28:18.420
 So I select a tail hook, which meant I could get one of those other ones,

28:18.420 --> 28:20.420
 but 80% of them are so are jets.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.420
 So I was in a good spot at that point.

28:22.420 --> 28:25.420
 And that's when I went to Merde, Mississippi to fly my first jet,

28:25.420 --> 28:27.420
 which was the T45 Gauzhawk.

28:27.420 --> 28:28.420
 Cool.

28:28.420 --> 28:30.420
 So what kind of plane is that?

28:30.420 --> 28:33.420
 Is that what you were doing your training on?

28:33.420 --> 28:37.420
 That's the jet aircraft you get in before you actually go to the F18.

28:37.420 --> 28:39.420
 It is carrier capable.

28:39.420 --> 28:42.420
 So go to the boat for the first time in it during the day,

28:42.420 --> 28:50.420
 drop fake bombs, do dog fighting, low levels, formation, flying day and night.

28:50.420 --> 28:52.420
 Oh, it's a pretty plane.

28:52.420 --> 28:53.420
 Yeah.

28:53.420 --> 28:56.420
 And it looks like a cone so that no one hits it.

28:56.420 --> 28:57.420
 Okay.

28:57.420 --> 28:58.420
 So that's usually not used for fighting.

28:58.420 --> 28:59.420
 It's used for training.

28:59.420 --> 29:01.420
 It's used for training how to fight.

29:01.420 --> 29:02.420
 Got it.

29:02.420 --> 29:03.420
 So what was that like?

29:03.420 --> 29:06.420
 Was that the first time you were sort of really getting into it?

29:06.420 --> 29:07.420
 Yeah.

29:07.420 --> 29:10.420
 So before that, it was a 600 horsepower prop plane.

29:10.420 --> 29:14.420
 Going from that to the T45 is one of like the biggest jumps in power

29:14.420 --> 29:17.420
 and like Navy, you know, machine operation.

29:17.420 --> 29:21.420
 How much horsepower does the T45 have approximately?

29:21.420 --> 29:23.420
 Like 15,000 or so.

29:23.420 --> 29:26.420
 So it's a huge jump from 600 you said horsepower about.

29:26.420 --> 29:27.420
 Cool.

29:27.420 --> 29:28.420
 So it's a big, big leap.

29:28.420 --> 29:31.420
 But it's a jet, you know, so it performs differently.

29:31.420 --> 29:32.420
 It's faster, right?

29:32.420 --> 29:34.420
 And what that means is not just because it's faster,

29:34.420 --> 29:35.420
 your whole mind needs to be faster.

29:35.420 --> 29:36.420
 Everything happens faster in the air now, right?

29:36.420 --> 29:37.420
 Yeah.

29:37.420 --> 29:38.420
 Those comms happen faster.

29:38.420 --> 29:41.420
 Your landing gear has to come up faster.

29:41.420 --> 29:42.420
 Everything just happens faster in a jet.

29:42.420 --> 29:44.420
 And so it's a big jump.

29:44.420 --> 29:49.420
 And I'll never forget going on my first flight in that aircraft,

29:49.420 --> 29:52.420
 it was a formation flight for someone else.

29:52.420 --> 29:55.420
 And I was just in the back watching and there was an instructor in the flight.

29:55.420 --> 29:58.420
 And so what that means is instructors in a single aircraft

29:58.420 --> 30:00.420
 and then there's three or four other aircraft

30:00.420 --> 30:02.420
 and they're learning how to do joins.

30:02.420 --> 30:04.420
 They're learning how to fly in formation.

30:04.420 --> 30:06.420
 And as a new student in the back, it's amazing, right?

30:06.420 --> 30:08.420
 Because, you know, photo op time and all this,

30:08.420 --> 30:10.420
 like I'm seeing aircraft up close for the first time.

30:10.420 --> 30:13.420
 It's awesome.

30:13.420 --> 30:17.420
 And on the way back, we couldn't get our landing gear down.

30:17.420 --> 30:18.420
 Ironically.

30:18.420 --> 30:21.420
 So it, you know, to make a long story short,

30:21.420 --> 30:23.420
 because it's overall not that exciting.

30:23.420 --> 30:24.420
 We couldn't get the gear down.

30:24.420 --> 30:28.420
 We actually went to go do a control ejection to the target area

30:28.420 --> 30:32.420
 where that is about 15, 20 miles to the north of the base.

30:32.420 --> 30:35.420
 Wait, did you just say that's not that exciting?

30:35.420 --> 30:38.420
 Well, because that to me is pretty exciting.

30:38.420 --> 30:43.420
 I mean, how, first of all, I mean, that must be terrifying.

30:43.420 --> 30:48.420
 Like early on in your careers, I haven't seen those things.

30:48.420 --> 30:52.420
 That, yeah, like how often does that kind of thing happen?

30:52.420 --> 30:54.420
 More than you would think.

30:54.420 --> 30:55.420
 More than you would think.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.420
 There was no significant panic.

30:57.420 --> 30:58.420
 This is like this understood.

30:58.420 --> 31:00.420
 This is what has to be done in this case.

31:00.420 --> 31:03.420
 I think I was probably just too dumb to realize the significance of it,

31:03.420 --> 31:06.420
 because as a new student, you know, not really appreciating,

31:06.420 --> 31:09.420
 you know, just what is ahead of me if we are rejecting.

31:09.420 --> 31:11.420
 But at the time it was more, it was just like rote, right?

31:11.420 --> 31:15.420
 Because I was back there and then I went from an observer mode to a,

31:15.420 --> 31:18.420
 I'm going to provide you the help that I can provide you as member of this crew,

31:18.420 --> 31:19.420
 you know, mode.

31:19.420 --> 31:24.420
 And so it was less about, you know, on this 20 mile trip and thinking about my,

31:24.420 --> 31:27.420
 how vulnerable I am, you know, we're going through checklists,

31:27.420 --> 31:29.420
 we're talking to people, we're getting ready.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.420
 So no, it wasn't, it wasn't fearful.

31:31.420 --> 31:35.420
 And the whole time we were doing one of these to try to get the gear down.

31:35.420 --> 31:40.420
 So we're unloading the jet and then loading it back to try to get the gear out with a stick.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.420
 And it came down.

31:42.420 --> 31:46.420
 It came down halfway there, just on its own.

31:46.420 --> 31:51.420
 So it came back around and we did like a safety trap in case there was a problem with the gear.

31:51.420 --> 31:55.420
 That was my first flight, you know, a little bit of serendipity,

31:55.420 --> 32:01.420
 but I'm going to fast forward a bit and I went back to the squadron as an instructor about five or six years later.

32:01.420 --> 32:07.420
 And I was an aviation safety officer at this point, which meant I was responsible for investigating mishaps.

32:07.420 --> 32:14.420
 And a, a student went in and he, he went in the back seat of a form flight,

32:14.420 --> 32:19.420
 just like the one I went on, and he went out and he ended up ejecting on that flight.

32:19.420 --> 32:28.420
 Zack's same type of flight. They went out and they had a runaway trim scenario and it caused the aircraft to just invert itself almost 180 degrees

32:28.420 --> 32:36.420
 at about 600 feet over the ground and they punched out just slightly outside the ejection window at about 300 or 400 feet or so,

32:36.420 --> 32:38.420
 but they were completely fine.

32:38.420 --> 32:45.420
 So, you know, and then about two months later, we had another ejection about three months after that, we had another ejection.

32:45.420 --> 32:50.420
 So, unfortunately, you know, it can, it can be more common than people think.

32:50.420 --> 32:52.420
 What does it feel like to get ejected?

32:52.420 --> 32:55.420
 Thankfully, I don't know. I can describe it to you.

32:55.420 --> 33:02.420
 I can tell you what it's like from what I've heard, but I truly think it's one of those things that you just don't understand until it happens.

33:02.420 --> 33:07.420
 It's like instantaneous about 250 Gs, which is only possible because of inertia in our blood.

33:07.420 --> 33:16.420
 So, you can actually get like 250, 300 Gs for like a few milliseconds and then it backs off to like 40 or 50 Gs to get you away from the vehicle itself.

33:16.420 --> 33:23.420
 And so, you know, you may lose consciousness if you do, you know, who knows where you wake up.

33:23.420 --> 33:27.420
 You know, you could be in a tree, you could still be falling, you can be in the water.

33:27.420 --> 33:31.420
 The physics of that is fascinating how to eject safely.

33:31.420 --> 33:34.420
 Do you know the story about how that was tested at all?

33:34.420 --> 33:37.420
 I don't know the full story, but there was an airport.

33:37.420 --> 33:41.420
 I'm guessing nobody knows the full story. It's probably a lot of shady stuff going on.

33:41.420 --> 33:44.420
 But you mean like in early, early days or?

33:44.420 --> 33:48.420
 They took a flight dock up to a rocket sled and just see how much their body could take it.

33:48.420 --> 33:55.420
 And he turned a lot of his body into mush in the process of getting that science done, but he saved a lot of lives.

33:55.420 --> 34:00.420
 People used to be tougher back in the day.

34:00.420 --> 34:03.420
 That's how science used to be done.

34:03.420 --> 34:05.420
 So how did your training continue?

34:05.420 --> 34:12.420
 So take me farther through your career as you work towards graduating towards the F18s.

34:12.420 --> 34:16.420
 So in VT9, where I was a student, there's two phases.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.420
 There's an intermediate and advanced.

34:18.420 --> 34:21.420
 Intermediate is getting very comfortable with the aircraft.

34:21.420 --> 34:24.420
 And at that point, you truly hear, all right, you're going jets now,

34:24.420 --> 34:29.420
 or you're going to go one of the other aircraft that landed on the aircraft carrier.

34:29.420 --> 34:32.420
 I was told I was going jets at that point.

34:32.420 --> 34:37.420
 And then we go into same squadron, same aircraft, same instructors, but it's called advanced now.

34:37.420 --> 34:40.420
 And now we're learning how to dogfight for the first time.

34:40.420 --> 34:46.420
 We're doing what we call tactical formation, which is just like aggressive position keeping.

34:46.420 --> 34:52.420
 We are doing dogfighting in low levels and all sorts of great stuff.

34:52.420 --> 34:56.420
 So it's really that first introduction to that tactical environment and putting,

34:56.420 --> 34:59.420
 really putting Gs on the jet and on your body and maneuvering.

34:59.420 --> 35:04.420
 Is that like tactical formation is collaborating with other fighter jets a part of that?

35:04.420 --> 35:05.420
 It is.

35:05.420 --> 35:07.420
 So flying in, that's what you mean by formation.

35:07.420 --> 35:10.420
 So literally having an awareness.

35:10.420 --> 35:17.420
 Is this done for you or are you as a human supposed to understand like where you are in the formation,

35:17.420 --> 35:19.420
 how to maintain formation, all that kind of stuff?

35:19.420 --> 35:20.420
 Yeah.

35:20.420 --> 35:22.420
 Is it done autonomously or manually?

35:22.420 --> 35:25.420
 There's a great autonomy point on the end of this I've thought about.

35:25.420 --> 35:32.420
 But what we do, it's all manual, so I'm looking at his wing and I'm looking at different visual checkpoints

35:32.420 --> 35:36.420
 that form like a triangle, like an equal out triangle essentially.

35:36.420 --> 35:42.420
 And then as that triangle is no longer equal, I can tell my relative position against that aircraft.

35:42.420 --> 35:43.420
 That's really cool.

35:43.420 --> 35:47.420
 And so that's what I'm staring at first, sometimes hours on end, several feet away,

35:47.420 --> 35:49.420
 doing one of these from in the weather.

35:49.420 --> 35:50.420
 That's all it is.

35:50.420 --> 35:53.420
 So you get, it's almost like, is it peripheral vision or is it?

35:53.420 --> 35:54.420
 No, we're staring directly at it.

35:54.420 --> 35:58.420
 The peripheral is going on my stuff, right?

35:58.420 --> 36:00.420
 My sensors and all my instruments.

36:00.420 --> 36:03.420
 And so he is my gyroscope at that point, right?

36:03.420 --> 36:04.420
 Wow.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.420
 You're flying not looking straight.

36:06.420 --> 36:07.420
 Correct.

36:07.420 --> 36:08.420
 I'm flying like this for hours.

36:08.420 --> 36:09.420
 It can hurt your neck.

36:09.420 --> 36:12.420
 We don't like doing this as much and I don't think it's just me, right?

36:12.420 --> 36:14.420
 It's a weird thing where when you're like this,

36:14.420 --> 36:21.420
 it's actually harder to fly formation slightly than here because being in line of your hand movements

36:21.420 --> 36:26.420
 and of the aircraft somehow has an effect on our ability to be more precise and comfortable

36:26.420 --> 36:27.420
 and strange.

36:27.420 --> 36:28.420
 Sure.

36:28.420 --> 36:32.420
 But so there's a symmetry to the formation usually.

36:32.420 --> 36:36.420
 So one of the people on the other side really don't like being on that side.

36:36.420 --> 36:39.420
 Who gets like the short straw?

36:39.420 --> 36:42.420
 How do you decide which side of the formation you are?

36:42.420 --> 36:45.420
 The good question too, because there's kind of rank in some sense.

36:45.420 --> 36:48.420
 So if it's a four person formation, right?

36:48.420 --> 36:51.420
 You have the division lead who's qualified to lead a whole division,

36:51.420 --> 36:52.420
 but maybe the other ones aren't.

36:52.420 --> 36:55.420
 And he has a dash two and that's his wingman essentially.

36:55.420 --> 36:57.420
 And then in a division, there's two other aircraft.

36:57.420 --> 36:59.420
 And then you have another senior flight leader.

36:59.420 --> 37:01.420
 That's the dash three position.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.420
 And then you have dash four, the last one.

37:04.420 --> 37:08.420
 And if you are all lined up on one side like fingertip, one, two, three, four,

37:08.420 --> 37:10.420
 that dash four guy is going to be at the end of that whip.

37:10.420 --> 37:14.420
 So if you're flying formation, each one's making movements relative to the lead.

37:14.420 --> 37:18.420
 Dash four is kind of, you know, at the end of that error, you know,

37:18.420 --> 37:20.420
 and so his movements are kind of like a whip.

37:20.420 --> 37:22.420
 It's very difficult to fly in that position and close.

37:22.420 --> 37:23.420
 Can you elaborate?

37:23.420 --> 37:24.420
 Is it because of the air?

37:24.420 --> 37:25.420
 The air dynamics?

37:25.420 --> 37:26.420
 So what's a whip?

37:26.420 --> 37:28.420
 If this is a flight lead and this is dash two,

37:28.420 --> 37:30.420
 flight lead is rock steady and just doing this thing.

37:30.420 --> 37:33.420
 Flight two is going to be working that triangle moving a little bit, right?

37:33.420 --> 37:36.420
 And he has a small error bubble that he's doing his best to stay.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.420
 And then, but dash three is flying off dash two.

37:38.420 --> 37:42.420
 And so his error bubble is dash twos plus his own.

37:42.420 --> 37:45.420
 So it gets more and more stressful as you get farther out.

37:45.420 --> 37:46.420
 It's difficult, yeah.

37:46.420 --> 37:47.420
 Okay.

37:47.420 --> 37:51.420
 What's the experience of that staring for long periods of time

37:51.420 --> 37:54.420
 and trying to maintain formation?

37:54.420 --> 37:55.420
 How stressful is that?

37:55.420 --> 38:01.420
 Because like, you know, we're doing that when we drive staying in lane

38:01.420 --> 38:06.420
 and that becomes, after you get pretty good at it, it becomes somewhat,

38:06.420 --> 38:10.420
 it's still stressful, which actually surprisingly stressful.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.420
 When you look at like lane keeping systems,

38:12.420 --> 38:15.420
 they actually relieve that stress somehow and it's actually creates

38:15.420 --> 38:19.420
 a much more pleasant experience while you're still able to maintain

38:19.420 --> 38:23.420
 situational awareness and like stay awake, which is really interesting.

38:23.420 --> 38:28.420
 Like, I don't think people realize how stressful it is to lane keep when they drive.

38:28.420 --> 38:30.420
 So this is even more stressful.

38:30.420 --> 38:34.420
 So are you, do you think about that?

38:34.420 --> 38:38.420
 Or is this, yeah, I guess how stressful is it from a psychology perspective?

38:38.420 --> 38:40.420
 It's very stressful.

38:40.420 --> 38:43.420
 So I taught students how to do this as well.

38:43.420 --> 38:45.420
 And so at our feet, we have two rudders.

38:45.420 --> 38:48.420
 And if I'm flying off of a flight lead over here,

38:48.420 --> 38:50.420
 what you'll find a lot of times is you'll be flying,

38:50.420 --> 38:52.420
 or like if I'm the instructor and the student's flying,

38:52.420 --> 38:56.420
 I'll start to notice that he's having a harder and harder time keeping position.

38:56.420 --> 38:59.420
 What I'll notice typically is he's locked out his leg.

38:59.420 --> 39:03.420
 The lock out the leg that's closest to the aircraft they're flying against

39:03.420 --> 39:05.420
 and push on the rudder subconsciously,

39:05.420 --> 39:09.420
 because their whole body's trying to get away from the aircraft because they're so uncomfortable being close to it.

39:09.420 --> 39:12.420
 And so I'll tell them, I can fix their form with just a couple words.

39:12.420 --> 39:14.420
 I'll say, wiggle your toes.

39:14.420 --> 39:17.420
 And they'll wiggle their toes and they'll loosen all the muscles in their legs

39:17.420 --> 39:21.420
 because they realize they've been locked up and their formation flying will get a lot better.

39:21.420 --> 39:25.420
 And so, you know, there's a lot of stress associated with that.

39:25.420 --> 39:34.420
 There's some interesting psychological or visual issues such as vertigo as you're flying.

39:34.420 --> 39:38.420
 So if you're flying with him and then you fly right into a cloud, right?

39:38.420 --> 39:41.420
 That's when it's very stressful because you have to be very close in order to maintain visual.

39:41.420 --> 39:43.420
 You might be on thunderstorm, right?

39:43.420 --> 39:45.420
 And so you have to be very tight.

39:45.420 --> 39:49.420
 You might start raining and then he's turning, but you might not even know that.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.420
 You might not even be able to see that turn.

39:51.420 --> 39:55.420
 And so all of a sudden you might look while you're in a turn thinking you were straight and level

39:55.420 --> 39:58.420
 and you look just maybe back at your instruments very quick

39:58.420 --> 40:00.420
 and you realize you're like in a 30 degree turn.

40:00.420 --> 40:05.420
 And your whole concept of where you are in the world starts getting very confused.

40:05.420 --> 40:09.420
 And you immediately get this sense of, it's weird.

40:09.420 --> 40:14.420
 Like I look at the HUD and it feels, all my senses are telling me it's spinning, but it's not, you know?

40:14.420 --> 40:17.420
 And so I have to trust my instruments even though it feels like it's spinning.

40:17.420 --> 40:20.420
 And the same thing can happen when you're flying formation off of someone

40:20.420 --> 40:25.420
 and it can be very dangerous and disorientating.

40:25.420 --> 40:30.420
 The point is to try to regain awareness by trusting the instruments.

40:30.420 --> 40:37.420
 Like distrust all your human senses and just use the instruments to rebuild situational awareness.

40:37.420 --> 40:43.420
 Not in this particular case because our situational awareness is predicated off of our flight lead.

40:43.420 --> 40:45.420
 So in a sense, I'm just trusting his movements.

40:45.420 --> 40:47.420
 And so he's my gyroscope, but you're absolutely right.

40:47.420 --> 40:49.420
 And if I was by myself, I would trust my instruments,

40:49.420 --> 40:53.420
 but I can't just stop flying form and trust my instruments because now I'm going to hit him.

40:53.420 --> 40:55.420
 So he's my reference.

40:55.420 --> 40:59.420
 So the instruments are not helping you significantly with his positioning?

40:59.420 --> 41:01.420
 Not. It's all complete manual.

41:01.420 --> 41:05.420
 So is there a future where some of that is autonomous?

41:05.420 --> 41:09.420
 Yeah. And I've thought about automating that flight regime.

41:09.420 --> 41:15.420
 But when I started thinking about it, I realized that all the formation keeping that we do

41:15.420 --> 41:23.420
 is designed to enhance the aviators ability to maintain sight, right?

41:23.420 --> 41:29.420
 So we fly very tight formations so that we can go in weather and to reduce groups of traffic coming into the boat.

41:29.420 --> 41:37.420
 We fly in one particular position so that all of the flight crew can look down the line and see the flight lead.

41:37.420 --> 41:46.420
 So everything has to do with the two aircrew visually maintaining sight of each other and defending each other, right?

41:46.420 --> 41:52.420
 In a combat spread, I might be looking three miles away from him flying formation, directly beam,

41:52.420 --> 41:54.420
 and looking around to make sure nothing's there.

41:54.420 --> 41:58.420
 So as I was looking into automating this process, I thought, well, you know,

41:58.420 --> 42:03.420
 sure, it's easy to get a bunch of aircraft to fly in formation off each other, right?

42:03.420 --> 42:07.420
 It's trivial, but why? You know, what is the best formation? Why are they doing that?

42:07.420 --> 42:12.420
 And that opened up a much more interesting regime of operations and flight mechanics.

42:12.420 --> 42:16.420
 And that's when we get back to that kind of stochastic mindset where we can bring in aircraft close

42:16.420 --> 42:20.420
 to do some type of normal flying or reduce congestion around airports.

42:20.420 --> 42:24.420
 But when we consider flying in a formation and tactical environment,

42:24.420 --> 42:29.420
 we can be much more effective with non traditional formation keeping or perhaps no formation keeping perhaps.

42:29.420 --> 42:36.420
 So autonomy used for formation keeping, not for convenience, but for the introduction of randomness that's hard to...

42:36.420 --> 42:38.420
 Like to a real time mission planner, yeah.

42:38.420 --> 42:42.420
 And then that's where you also have some human modifications.

42:42.420 --> 42:46.420
 So it's like unmanned teaming enters that picture.

42:46.420 --> 42:53.420
 So you use some of the human intuition and adjustment of this formation.

42:53.420 --> 42:55.420
 The formation itself has some uncertainty.

42:55.420 --> 43:02.420
 I mean, it's such an interesting dance. I think that is the most fascinating application

43:02.420 --> 43:08.420
 of artificial intelligence is when it's human AI collaboration that that semi autonomous dance

43:08.420 --> 43:14.420
 that you see in the semi autonomous vehicle systems in terms of cars being driving,

43:14.420 --> 43:20.420
 but also in the safety critical situation of an airplane of a fighter jet,

43:20.420 --> 43:26.420
 especially when you're flying fast. I mean, in a split second you have to make all these kinds of decisions

43:26.420 --> 43:31.420
 and it feels like an AI system can do as much harm as it can help.

43:31.420 --> 43:35.420
 And so to get that right is a really fascinating challenge.

43:35.420 --> 43:39.420
 One of the challenges too isn't just the algorithms of the autonomy itself,

43:39.420 --> 43:41.420
 how it senses the environment.

43:41.420 --> 43:45.420
 That of course is going to be what all these decisions are based off of.

43:45.420 --> 43:48.420
 And that's a challenge in this type of environment.

43:48.420 --> 43:53.420
 I ask, so F 18, what's it like to fly a fighter jet as best?

43:53.420 --> 43:58.420
 I mean, what to you is beautiful, powerful?

43:58.420 --> 44:01.420
 What do you love about the experience of flying?

44:01.420 --> 44:04.420
 For me, you know, and I think I'm an outlier bit.

44:04.420 --> 44:08.420
 It wasn't necessarily the flying itself, right?

44:08.420 --> 44:13.420
 It wasn't necessarily the soaring over the clouds and, you know,

44:13.420 --> 44:17.420
 looking down at the earth from upside down, you know, I came to love that.

44:17.420 --> 44:19.420
 But it wasn't necessarily the passion that drove me there.

44:19.420 --> 44:21.420
 I just had no exposure to that.

44:21.420 --> 44:28.420
 The only exposure I had was reading and going in the woods and science fiction and all that.

44:28.420 --> 44:33.420
 And so, you know, what seemed to kind of drive me towards that was just a desire

44:33.420 --> 44:38.420
 to really be operating as close to what I thought was the edge of technology or science.

44:38.420 --> 44:41.420
 And that's the path that I chose to try to get close to that.

44:41.420 --> 44:45.420
 I thought that being in a fighter jet and, you know,

44:45.420 --> 44:51.420
 all the tools and the technology and the knowledge and the challenges

44:51.420 --> 44:54.420
 and the, you know, failures and victories that would come with that

44:54.420 --> 44:58.420
 just seemed like something that I wanted to be a part of.

44:58.420 --> 45:02.420
 And it wasn't necessarily about the flying, but it was about the challenge.

45:02.420 --> 45:06.420
 And like I said, as a person from a small town, you know,

45:06.420 --> 45:09.420
 small high school being able to get my hands, you know,

45:09.420 --> 45:12.420
 or even just near something of such technological significance

45:12.420 --> 45:15.420
 was kind of empowering for me.

45:15.420 --> 45:18.420
 And that's kind of what bore the love of flight from there, you know,

45:18.420 --> 45:21.420
 becoming, you know, having some level of mastery in that aircraft.

45:21.420 --> 45:23.420
 It really feels like an extension of your body.

45:23.420 --> 45:28.420
 And once I got there, then the kind of the love of flying kind of followed.

45:28.420 --> 45:32.420
 So you sort of, one is the man mastery over the machine.

45:32.420 --> 45:37.420
 And second is the machine is like the greatest thing that humans have ever created, arguably.

45:37.420 --> 45:41.420
 The things that Lockheed Martin and others have built.

45:41.420 --> 45:48.420
 I mean, the engineering in that, it's, however you feel about war,

45:48.420 --> 45:54.420
 which is one of the sad things about human civilization is war inspires

45:54.420 --> 45:59.420
 the engineering of tools that are incredible.

45:59.420 --> 46:03.420
 And it's like, maybe without war, if we look at human history,

46:03.420 --> 46:06.420
 we would not build some of the incredible things we built.

46:06.420 --> 46:11.420
 So in order to win wars, to stop wars, we build these incredible systems

46:11.420 --> 46:14.420
 that perhaps propagate war.

46:14.420 --> 46:17.420
 And that's another discussion I'll ask you about.

46:17.420 --> 46:22.420
 But this, do you, this is like, this is a chance to experience

46:22.420 --> 46:27.420
 the greatest engineering humans have ever been able to do.

46:27.420 --> 46:31.420
 Like similar, I suppose, that astronauts feel like when they're flying.

46:31.420 --> 46:34.420
 And I wanted to be an astronaut. I wanted to take that route.

46:34.420 --> 46:37.420
 I was going to apply to test pilot school.

46:37.420 --> 46:39.420
 It just didn't work out for me.

46:39.420 --> 46:42.420
 I ended up having a broken foot during my window.

46:42.420 --> 46:46.420
 But long story short, I ended up after my time in my fleet squadron

46:46.420 --> 46:48.420
 and we can get back to the rest of the timeline if you want.

46:48.420 --> 46:53.420
 But I went to be an instructor pilot instead, right?

46:53.420 --> 46:58.420
 And then, you know, I was talking about this with a squadron mate earlier today

46:58.420 --> 47:01.420
 about how, you know, I certainly wouldn't be talking with Lex today

47:01.420 --> 47:04.420
 if I ended up going to test pilot school.

47:04.420 --> 47:12.420
 I never would have had the, maybe recklessness, I don't know,

47:12.420 --> 47:17.420
 but the willingness to have a conversation about UAP while I was, you know,

47:17.420 --> 47:20.420
 that led me to the decision to get out once I went there.

47:20.420 --> 47:26.420
 And it kind of enabled me to talk about UAP more publicly.

47:26.420 --> 47:29.420
 And if I stayed in the Navy, then I don't think that would have happened.

47:29.420 --> 47:33.420
 I wouldn't have been able to if I went that route.

47:33.420 --> 47:37.420
 Well, as a small tangent, do you hope to travel to Mars one day?

47:37.420 --> 47:40.420
 Do you think you'll step foot on Mars one day?

47:40.420 --> 47:44.420
 If you asked me that five years ago, I would have said yes, I want to.

47:44.420 --> 47:48.420
 In fact, I would like to die on Mars.

47:48.420 --> 47:52.420
 Now, now I have some hesitations and I have some hesitations

47:52.420 --> 47:54.420
 because I'm hopeful and optimistic.

47:54.420 --> 47:59.420
 And I think that, you know, I think that we are truly like on the brink of a very

47:59.420 --> 48:03.420
 wide technological revolution that's going to kind of move us,

48:03.420 --> 48:08.420
 how we used to move information and data in this last century.

48:08.420 --> 48:11.420
 We're going to be manipulating and managing matter in that next century.

48:11.420 --> 48:15.420
 And so I think that, I think our reach as humans, as humans,

48:15.420 --> 48:18.420
 they're going to get a lot wider, a lot faster than people may realize,

48:18.420 --> 48:19.420
 or at least.

48:19.420 --> 48:22.420
 Wait, are you getting like super ambitious beyond Mars?

48:22.420 --> 48:23.420
 Is that what you're saying?

48:23.420 --> 48:24.420
 Well, I mean.

48:24.420 --> 48:26.420
 Like Mars seems kind of boring.

48:26.420 --> 48:27.420
 I want to go beyond that.

48:27.420 --> 48:32.420
 Do you mean the reach of humanity across all kinds of technologies,

48:32.420 --> 48:34.420
 or do you mean literally across space?

48:34.420 --> 48:35.420
 Across space, you know.

48:35.420 --> 48:39.420
 So, you know, we're going to be, I think that as artificial intelligence

48:39.420 --> 48:42.420
 and machine learning start broaching further into the topic of science,

48:42.420 --> 48:45.420
 the area of science, and we start working through new physics,

48:45.420 --> 48:49.420
 we start working through, or I should say, past the Einsteinian frameworks

48:49.420 --> 48:54.420
 as we kind of get a better idea of what space time is or isn't.

48:54.420 --> 48:57.420
 We may have, we may find, you know, answers that we didn't know

48:57.420 --> 49:00.420
 that we were looking for, and we may have more opportunity.

49:00.420 --> 49:02.420
 And I'm not saying this is something I'm, you know,

49:02.420 --> 49:06.420
 betting the farm on, of course, but maybe, maybe that's a road

49:06.420 --> 49:09.420
 I want to explore on Earth instead of on Mars.

49:09.420 --> 49:13.420
 Maybe there's technology that can be brought to bear with new science

49:13.420 --> 49:16.420
 and harder engineering that is a road that doesn't go past Mars

49:16.420 --> 49:18.420
 to get outside the solar system.

49:18.420 --> 49:21.420
 So there are different ways to explore the universe

49:21.420 --> 49:24.420
 than the traditional rocket systems.

49:24.420 --> 49:29.420
 If we can continue sort of your journey,

49:29.420 --> 49:36.420
 you said that you were attracted to the incredibly advanced technologies

49:36.420 --> 49:40.420
 of the F20, of the F18s, and just the fighter jets in general.

49:40.420 --> 49:46.420
 Let me ask another question, which seems incredibly difficult to do,

49:46.420 --> 49:51.420
 which is landing on a carrier or taking off from a carrier

49:51.420 --> 49:52.420
 and landing on a carrier.

49:52.420 --> 49:54.420
 So what's that like?

49:54.420 --> 49:56.420
 What are the challenges of that?

49:56.420 --> 49:57.420
 Taking off is pretty easy.

49:57.420 --> 50:00.420
 It's procedurally somewhat complex,

50:00.420 --> 50:03.420
 where there's a lot of moving parts, almost like a clock, you know.

50:03.420 --> 50:05.420
 You're almost on a pocket watch, so it's a fence,

50:05.420 --> 50:06.420
 and you're a part of the machinery.

50:06.420 --> 50:08.420
 And so long as you press the right buttons

50:08.420 --> 50:10.420
 and do the right things, then you go shooting off the front.

50:10.420 --> 50:12.420
 So there's like a checklist to follow,

50:12.420 --> 50:14.420
 and there's several people involved in that checklist,

50:14.420 --> 50:16.420
 and you just got to follow the checklist correctly.

50:16.420 --> 50:17.420
 Essentially, yep.

50:17.420 --> 50:18.420
 There's lots of ways to screw it up,

50:18.420 --> 50:20.420
 but you'll know how to screw it up.

50:20.420 --> 50:24.420
 But landing on the back of the boat is a whole different animal.

50:24.420 --> 50:26.420
 There's a lot more variables.

50:26.420 --> 50:31.420
 There's essentially one or two people responsible for the success of that.

50:31.420 --> 50:35.420
 The landing signal officer, who actually represents a team

50:35.420 --> 50:38.420
 of specially trained aviators who are responsible

50:38.420 --> 50:41.420
 for helping that aviator land on the boat.

50:41.420 --> 50:44.420
 And the pilot himself.

50:44.420 --> 50:50.420
 And it is a hard task to actually fly precisely enough to be good at it.

50:50.420 --> 50:53.420
 So to fly, quote, unquote, the perfect pass,

50:53.420 --> 50:56.420
 you essentially have to fly your head through a one foot by one foot box.

50:56.420 --> 50:59.420
 That's essentially the target you're shooting for.

50:59.420 --> 51:02.420
 Plus or minus, probably about five knots on airspeed,

51:02.420 --> 51:04.420
 although we don't really judge it by airspeed.

51:04.420 --> 51:06.420
 It's something called angle of attack,

51:06.420 --> 51:09.420
 but generally, you know, pretty tight parameters there.

51:09.420 --> 51:11.420
 And you can do everything perfect and still fail, right?

51:11.420 --> 51:14.420
 So when we go to touchdown, we immediately bring the power up

51:14.420 --> 51:19.420
 and we rotate as if we were bouncing off the deck.

51:19.420 --> 51:22.420
 And if we catch it, then we slow down.

51:22.420 --> 51:25.420
 And then someone tells us to bring the power back, which we do.

51:25.420 --> 51:29.420
 We don't do it on our own because it's such a violent experience.

51:29.420 --> 51:32.420
 You can think you're trapped or not or something breaks

51:32.420 --> 51:34.420
 and you bring your throttle back.

51:34.420 --> 51:35.420
 That's a very serious thing.

51:35.420 --> 51:36.420
 It happened best of us.

51:36.420 --> 51:38.420
 You know, I've done it once.

51:38.420 --> 51:42.420
 When I first got to the squadron, it's called ease guns land.

51:42.420 --> 51:45.420
 And so, you know, I came in the boat and I brought the power.

51:45.420 --> 51:48.420
 I cracked the power back a little bit before I've been told to

51:48.420 --> 51:51.420
 or that my aircraft had finished settling in.

51:51.420 --> 51:53.420
 And that was a big faux pas, right?

51:53.420 --> 51:54.420
 So especially as a new guy.

51:54.420 --> 51:57.420
 So it's a very serious business.

51:57.420 --> 51:59.420
 There's a lot of eyes on you and there's a lot of ways to screw it up.

51:59.420 --> 52:03.420
 But the physical, you know, rush of like having a great pass

52:03.420 --> 52:06.420
 and then like there's just a like the crash of into the boat

52:06.420 --> 52:08.420
 and all that, the physical sensation from it.

52:08.420 --> 52:10.420
 You know, when everything's going great, you know,

52:10.420 --> 52:12.420
 at the top of the world, it's a great feeling.

52:12.420 --> 52:13.420
 How much of it is feel?

52:13.420 --> 52:16.420
 How much of it is instruments?

52:16.420 --> 52:18.420
 How much is other people just doing the work for you,

52:18.420 --> 52:20.420
 catching you as long as you do everything right?

52:20.420 --> 52:21.420
 There's a few systems we use.

52:21.420 --> 52:22.420
 One is called the ball.

52:22.420 --> 52:25.420
 And the ball is external to our aircraft.

52:25.420 --> 52:27.420
 And it's BALL.

52:27.420 --> 52:28.420
 Ball, like ball.

52:28.420 --> 52:30.420
 It's an eye floss landing system,

52:30.420 --> 52:33.420
 which stands for something very long convoluted.

52:33.420 --> 52:35.420
 But essentially it's a mirror with lights on it.

52:35.420 --> 52:40.420
 And you see the light at a different cell

52:40.420 --> 52:44.420
 based on your position relative to an ideal glide slope.

52:44.420 --> 52:46.420
 So if you're right on it, you're right in the middle.

52:46.420 --> 52:48.420
 And if you're below, you're low.

52:48.420 --> 52:53.420
 And as I add power and maneuver the aircraft, that ball,

52:53.420 --> 52:55.420
 you know, I see that ball rise, I see that ball low.

52:55.420 --> 52:57.420
 It's a lagging indicator though, right?

52:57.420 --> 53:00.420
 And your jet is a lagging engine too, right?

53:00.420 --> 53:01.420
 It takes time to spool up the engine.

53:01.420 --> 53:05.420
 So that adds to the complexity, you have to think ahead a bit.

53:05.420 --> 53:07.420
 You know, so you don't want to,

53:07.420 --> 53:10.420
 you can't just bring the power up and leave it there.

53:10.420 --> 53:12.420
 You have to bring the power up, touch it and bring it back.

53:12.420 --> 53:15.420
 And oh, by the way, your landing area is moving,

53:15.420 --> 53:17.420
 not just away from you, but also on an angle, right?

53:17.420 --> 53:18.420
 Because we have an angled deck.

53:18.420 --> 53:21.420
 And so you're constantly doing one of these

53:21.420 --> 53:23.420
 to correct yourself as you go.

53:23.420 --> 53:24.420
 That seems stressful.

53:24.420 --> 53:26.420
 And even every time you do one of those,

53:26.420 --> 53:28.420
 maybe it's a 30 degree angle bank, right?

53:28.420 --> 53:29.420
 I'm losing lift, right?

53:29.420 --> 53:30.420
 Yeah.

53:30.420 --> 53:32.420
 And so I have to compensate with power each time I do that.

53:32.420 --> 53:33.420
 So I'm doing another one.

53:33.420 --> 53:36.420
 Because you have to maintain the same level

53:36.420 --> 53:38.420
 you're always lowering.

53:38.420 --> 53:40.420
 It's a constant rate of descent that's increasing

53:40.420 --> 53:43.420
 from about 200 feet per minute to about 650.

53:43.420 --> 53:45.420
 And every time you do this, that's messing with that.

53:45.420 --> 53:46.420
 Okay.

53:46.420 --> 53:47.420
 So you have to compensate.

53:47.420 --> 53:48.420
 And you're doing that manually.

53:48.420 --> 53:49.420
 Do that manually.

53:49.420 --> 53:50.420
 All right.

53:50.420 --> 53:52.420
 And then of course, as you come down that glide slope,

53:52.420 --> 53:54.420
 it becomes more and more narrow.

53:54.420 --> 53:56.420
 And you have to, of course,

53:56.420 --> 54:00.420
 modulate your inputs such that they're smaller and smaller

54:00.420 --> 54:01.420
 because they have a bigger and bigger effect

54:01.420 --> 54:03.420
 as you get closer in.

54:03.420 --> 54:05.420
 And what happens to when you get in close

54:05.420 --> 54:07.420
 is that right before you cross over,

54:07.420 --> 54:09.420
 if this is the boat right here, your table,

54:09.420 --> 54:13.420
 right before you kind of get your wings over the boat itself,

54:13.420 --> 54:17.420
 this big wind from the main tower of the boat

54:17.420 --> 54:18.420
 is where it dips down.

54:18.420 --> 54:19.420
 So the wind actually goes down.

54:19.420 --> 54:20.420
 It's called the Burble.

54:20.420 --> 54:21.420
 And it'll actually pull the aircraft down,

54:21.420 --> 54:22.420
 increase your rate of descent.

54:22.420 --> 54:25.420
 So at that particular point, you need to, you know,

54:25.420 --> 54:27.420
 increase your power and try to compensate against that.

54:27.420 --> 54:29.420
 And so that's kind of a third variable that's trying to

54:29.420 --> 54:31.420
 screw you up on your way down.

54:31.420 --> 54:34.420
 What's the most difficult conditions in which you have to land

54:34.420 --> 54:36.420
 or you've seen somebody have to land?

54:36.420 --> 54:40.420
 Because I think you were also a signal officer as well.

54:40.420 --> 54:41.420
 I was, yeah.

54:41.420 --> 54:44.420
 I was the head landing signal officer for my squadron.

54:44.420 --> 54:46.420
 So you've probably seen some tough landings.

54:46.420 --> 54:47.420
 I have.

54:47.420 --> 54:49.420
 I've seen a ramp strike,

54:49.420 --> 54:54.420
 which is when a part of the aircraft hits before the landing area,

54:54.420 --> 54:57.420
 which is basically the round out of the boat that is before

54:57.420 --> 54:58.420
 the landing area.

54:58.420 --> 55:00.420
 So they basically struck the back of the boat coming in.

55:00.420 --> 55:01.420
 Yeah.

55:01.420 --> 55:02.420
 It was just their hook.

55:02.420 --> 55:04.420
 So it wasn't the aircraft.

55:04.420 --> 55:05.420
 And they were fine.

55:05.420 --> 55:06.420
 That one was kind of ugly.

55:06.420 --> 55:09.420
 But it like rips that part of the aircraft.

55:09.420 --> 55:10.420
 Absolutely.

55:10.420 --> 55:12.420
 And then you land on your bellies, that kind of thing.

55:12.420 --> 55:15.420
 In this particular case, it hit and then it gave

55:15.420 --> 55:18.420
 and essentially dragged the hook on the surface after that.

55:18.420 --> 55:20.420
 And so he was able to grab a wire at that point.

55:20.420 --> 55:22.420
 When does that kind of thing happen?

55:22.420 --> 55:26.420
 The miscalculation by the pilot or is it weather conditions?

55:26.420 --> 55:28.420
 I wouldn't even call it a miscalculation.

55:28.420 --> 55:30.420
 I mean, I'm going to put the blame on the pilot because he's

55:30.420 --> 55:31.420
 the only one in the cockpit.

55:31.420 --> 55:34.420
 But then the day he's reacting to the situations he's dealing with.

55:34.420 --> 55:38.420
 And so it may be errors or he may be doing the best with, you know,

55:38.420 --> 55:41.420
 the conditions that he's been given on that particular one.

55:41.420 --> 55:43.420
 You just got too high a rate of sense.

55:43.420 --> 55:44.420
 Very common.

55:44.420 --> 55:45.420
 And that's what you see it with new pilots.

55:45.420 --> 55:47.420
 You see it with older pilots, right?

55:47.420 --> 55:49.420
 New ones and complacent ones.

55:49.420 --> 55:53.420
 What you see is they'll try to make the ball go right where they want it

55:53.420 --> 55:54.420
 in close.

55:54.420 --> 55:56.420
 They think they can beat the game a little bit.

55:56.420 --> 55:58.420
 And so we have sayings.

55:58.420 --> 56:01.420
 We teach pilots, you know, as a landing signal officer,

56:01.420 --> 56:04.420
 we tell them, like, don't recenter a high ball in close.

56:04.420 --> 56:05.420
 It's one of the rules to live by.

56:05.420 --> 56:09.420
 And so when the ball is up high, don't try to bring it back in close

56:09.420 --> 56:11.420
 to, like, the center point when you're in close.

56:11.420 --> 56:13.420
 Because what you're going to do is you bring the power off

56:13.420 --> 56:14.420
 and you're going to crash right down.

56:14.420 --> 56:15.420
 And that's what happens, right?

56:15.420 --> 56:17.420
 Because you've got the verbal pulling you down.

56:17.420 --> 56:20.420
 You might be correcting, which is decreasing your lift.

56:20.420 --> 56:23.420
 And then you have that type of maneuver.

56:23.420 --> 56:26.420
 How are you supposed to do all of this in harsh weather conditions?

56:26.420 --> 56:28.420
 And so that's the one I wanted to tell you about.

56:28.420 --> 56:29.420
 That's the hardest one.

56:29.420 --> 56:32.420
 And what you hear is if you hear 99 taxi lights on,

56:32.420 --> 56:34.420
 that's really shitty.

56:34.420 --> 56:36.420
 99 taxi lights on.

56:36.420 --> 56:37.420
 What's that mean?

56:37.420 --> 56:39.420
 So everyone put your taxi lights on.

56:39.420 --> 56:42.420
 Because you're about to land on the boat.

56:42.420 --> 56:43.420
 And you don't see the boat?

56:43.420 --> 56:47.420
 Weather is so bad that the landing signal officer on the boat

56:47.420 --> 56:48.420
 can't see you either.

56:48.420 --> 56:49.420
 And you can't see the boat.

56:49.420 --> 56:52.420
 And you won't be able to see it when you touch down.

56:52.420 --> 56:54.420
 So we call that a zero, zero landing.

56:54.420 --> 56:57.420
 And you turn on the taxi lights so that the LSO,

56:57.420 --> 57:02.420
 who has a radio in his hand that looks like a phone from 1980,

57:02.420 --> 57:04.420
 is talking directly to the pilot.

57:04.420 --> 57:06.420
 And he's looking at that little light in the rain.

57:06.420 --> 57:11.420
 And he's telling him, you're high, you're low, power, things like that.

57:11.420 --> 57:13.420
 Come right, back to the left.

57:13.420 --> 57:16.420
 And literally talking him down to land on the boat right there.

57:16.420 --> 57:18.420
 And the pilot, usually it comes as a surprise to the pilot to land it.

57:18.420 --> 57:20.420
 Because he's just listening to the voice.

57:20.420 --> 57:21.420
 Can't see the ball.

57:21.420 --> 57:22.420
 Can't see the boat.

57:22.420 --> 57:23.420
 And all of a sudden you just hit the boat.

57:23.420 --> 57:24.420
 You crash.

57:24.420 --> 57:25.420
 I mean, you crash.

57:25.420 --> 57:28.420
 We're going about 1,600 feet per minute descent at that point.

57:28.420 --> 57:30.420
 So you're still, you're going super fast.

57:30.420 --> 57:32.420
 So all of this is happening fast.

57:32.420 --> 57:37.420
 You don't know, you don't know at the moment it's going to hit.

57:37.420 --> 57:39.420
 So you're just going into the darkness.

57:39.420 --> 57:41.420
 And just waiting for it to hit.

57:41.420 --> 57:42.420
 It's not dark though.

57:42.420 --> 57:43.420
 A lot of times it's white.

57:43.420 --> 57:44.420
 Into the light.

57:44.420 --> 57:46.420
 You're going into the light.

57:46.420 --> 57:49.420
 And then there's a voice from an 80s phone.

57:49.420 --> 57:50.420
 I got it.

57:50.420 --> 57:53.420
 This is terrible.

57:53.420 --> 57:58.420
 But so that you still, you still have to, so this kind of thing happens.

57:58.420 --> 58:00.420
 You still have to land.

58:00.420 --> 58:02.420
 Sometimes you just don't have a place to divert.

58:02.420 --> 58:05.420
 But you know, in a sense, we're trained for that because we do the night landings as well.

58:05.420 --> 58:07.420
 And I think you'll find this interesting.

58:07.420 --> 58:11.420
 But I always found that the night landings where in these particular cases,

58:11.420 --> 58:15.420
 you're usually lined up behind the boat, maybe 10, 15 miles.

58:15.420 --> 58:18.420
 Whereas the other ones, it's like a tight circle, the landing pattern.

58:18.420 --> 58:24.420
 And so we can potentially see the boat way out there if the lights were on, which they're not.

58:24.420 --> 58:27.420
 But we can maybe see like the string of aircraft in front of us.

58:27.420 --> 58:30.420
 But what's, what's interesting is that it can take a while.

58:30.420 --> 58:35.420
 It can take, you might be 15 miles out and your lights are turned down as dim as possible.

58:35.420 --> 58:38.420
 You have a cloud deck, maybe at six or 7,000 feet.

58:38.420 --> 58:42.420
 So that the starlight, there's no moon, but let's say the starlight's blocked out, right?

58:42.420 --> 58:46.420
 Because just a starlight alone, no moon, you can see the boat, you can see the water.

58:46.420 --> 58:50.420
 But when that goes away, it's like closing your eyes, right?

58:50.420 --> 58:51.420
 You can't tell anything.

58:51.420 --> 58:53.420
 It could be upside down.

58:53.420 --> 58:55.420
 It could be in any position.

58:55.420 --> 59:02.420
 And for me, it was almost a meditative process that I had to snap myself back out of when I was on like a long straightaway.

59:02.420 --> 59:06.420
 And then I would see the light pop up in the sea of darkness, right?

59:06.420 --> 59:07.420
 No lights anywhere.

59:07.420 --> 59:08.420
 Can't even see the horizon.

59:08.420 --> 59:10.420
 And I just see a light out there.

59:10.420 --> 59:13.420
 My instruments are telling me, and they're turned down as far as I can go, right?

59:13.420 --> 59:14.420
 So I can barely see them.

59:14.420 --> 59:15.420
 So my eyes can adjust.

59:15.420 --> 59:17.420
 And I'm just staring at this light in the distance.

59:17.420 --> 59:21.420
 And it's just very meditative and it's the hum behind you.

59:21.420 --> 59:26.420
 And then like four miles, you know, almost like, oh, the light is a little bit bigger.

59:26.420 --> 59:31.420
 And you almost kind of have to snap back to it and be like, oh, I need to like kind of like look around a little bit and engage my brain.

59:31.420 --> 59:34.420
 Like back to my body and like do this thing.

59:34.420 --> 59:36.420
 Because you're going to have to actually land.

59:36.420 --> 59:41.420
 Well, is there just, you said you don't necessarily feel the romantic notion of the whole thing.

59:41.420 --> 59:48.420
 But is there some aspects of flying where you look up and maybe you see the stars, the stars?

59:48.420 --> 59:54.420
 Or yeah, that kind of thing that you just like, holy crap, how did humans accomplish all of this?

59:54.420 --> 59:57.420
 Like, am I actually flying right now?

59:57.420 --> 1:00:01.420
 I used to have those moments on the boat when I was catching planes land.

1:00:01.420 --> 1:00:04.420
 I would, they would trap and it'd be nighttime.

1:00:04.420 --> 1:00:07.420
 And it's just all this chaos in the middle of the ocean and nothing.

1:00:07.420 --> 1:00:10.420
 And I would have these moments where I'd be like, how the hell did I end up here?

1:00:10.420 --> 1:00:15.420
 You know, there's one moment in time next to an aircraft landing on a boat in the middle of the ocean, you know.

1:00:15.420 --> 1:00:18.420
 Where did my life, you know, how did my life go to end up here?

1:00:18.420 --> 1:00:19.420
 How interesting.

1:00:19.420 --> 1:00:26.420
 But what I did start to enjoy was the night vision goggles and putting those on and looking up at the stars flying around.

1:00:26.420 --> 1:00:28.420
 Especially over the ocean.

1:00:28.420 --> 1:00:29.420
 What do they look like?

1:00:29.420 --> 1:00:30.420
 There's just so many.

1:00:30.420 --> 1:00:33.420
 There's just so many stars that, you know, you normally can't see.

1:00:33.420 --> 1:00:35.420
 They're shooting stars all the time.

1:00:35.420 --> 1:00:37.420
 Almost every flight you'd see them with the goggles on.

1:00:37.420 --> 1:00:43.420
 And so it was a great pleasure to take advantage of the lack of light pollution in some cases,

1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:49.420
 especially on deployment, to go grab some goggles at night and go out some quiet spot in the ship that no one can see me.

1:00:49.420 --> 1:00:51.420
 And just kind of look around, you know.

1:00:51.420 --> 1:00:53.420
 Yeah, it's humbling.

1:00:53.420 --> 1:00:56.420
 Quick break? Bath and break?

1:00:56.420 --> 1:00:58.420
 That wouldn't mind a quick stretch of luck.

1:00:58.420 --> 1:01:00.420
 You got a few cool patches.

1:01:00.420 --> 1:01:01.420
 I do.

1:01:01.420 --> 1:01:07.420
 So this is a VFA 11 Red Rippers patch, typically going actually on our arm.

1:01:07.420 --> 1:01:11.420
 So this is actually what we call the boar's head or Arnold.

1:01:11.420 --> 1:01:16.420
 So this is actually the boar's head from the Gordon's Gin bottle.

1:01:16.420 --> 1:01:17.420
 Yeah.

1:01:17.420 --> 1:01:26.420
 So in 1918, we were in London or the UK somewhere and we apparently partied with the owner and founder of Gordon's Gin.

1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:31.420
 We had a great time and there's a signed letter in our ready room that says we can use the logo in perpetuity.

1:01:31.420 --> 1:01:33.420
 Oh, nice.

1:01:33.420 --> 1:01:34.420
 Yeah.

1:01:34.420 --> 1:01:36.420
 So I'd like to give you that patch.

1:01:36.420 --> 1:01:39.420
 I drank quite a bit of Gordon's, so this is good.

1:01:39.420 --> 1:01:44.420
 And I'd like to give you that coin from our squadron.

1:01:44.420 --> 1:01:48.420
 The Red Rippers, that's a badass name.

1:01:48.420 --> 1:01:49.420
 Thank you, brother.

1:01:49.420 --> 1:01:50.420
 You're welcome.

1:01:50.420 --> 1:01:58.420
 So let's jump around a little bit, but let me ask you about this one set of experiences that you had and people in your squadron had.

1:01:58.420 --> 1:02:04.420
 So you and a few people in the squadron either detected UFOs on your instruments or saw them directly.

1:02:04.420 --> 1:02:11.420
 Tell me the full story of these UFO sightings and the smallest technical details because I love those.

1:02:11.420 --> 1:02:13.420
 I'll do my best.

1:02:13.420 --> 1:02:24.420
 So we returned from, and when I say we, I mean, not my squadron, but VFA 11, the Red Rippers, I was a somewhat junior pilot at the time.

1:02:24.420 --> 1:02:34.420
 I joined them on deployment in 2012 where they had been already out there for about six months or so operating in the vicinity of Afghanistan.

1:02:34.420 --> 1:02:47.420
 I joined them and then we flew back and still as a relatively new guy, we came back and we entered what's considered a maintenance phase where we slow down the tactical flying a bit, kind of recuperate, do some maintenance on the aircraft.

1:02:47.420 --> 1:03:03.420
 And our particular model of the F 18, the lot, the lot number was plumbed for the particular things that were needed to upgrade the radar from what's known as the APG 73 to the APG 79.

1:03:03.420 --> 1:03:09.420
 And the APG 73 is a mechanically scanned array radar.

1:03:09.420 --> 1:03:19.420
 It's a, you know, perfectly fine radar, but the ASA radar is kind of a, you know, magnitude jump in capability, kind of an analog digital kind of mindset.

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:23.420
 So it's a leap to digital APG 73.

1:03:23.420 --> 1:03:26.420
 So I mean, are these things on a carrier?

1:03:26.420 --> 1:03:27.420
 Like, what are we talking about here?

1:03:27.420 --> 1:03:29.420
 This is our biggest radar.

1:03:29.420 --> 1:03:30.420
 Yeah.

1:03:30.420 --> 1:03:32.420
 So this is actually the radars in the F 18 itself.

1:03:32.420 --> 1:03:33.420
 Okay.

1:03:33.420 --> 1:03:43.420
 So when you say they were chosen, this is to test the upgrade to the new, the 79 APG 79 less of a test and more of just, Hey, it's your turn to get the upgrade.

1:03:43.420 --> 1:03:45.420
 Like we're all going to these better radars.

1:03:45.420 --> 1:03:49.420
 They were building ones off the off the line with the new radar.

1:03:49.420 --> 1:03:54.420
 But we were this weird transitionary squadron in the middle that transitioned from the older ones to the new ones.

1:03:54.420 --> 1:04:05.420
 But it's not particularly rare to fly with different types of radar because in the, in we call the fleet replacement squadron, essentially the training ground for the F 18, you have all sorts of F 18s with different radars.

1:04:05.420 --> 1:04:14.420
 So you are used to having multiple ones, but in the actual deployable combat squadron, we upgraded.

1:04:14.420 --> 1:04:23.420
 And when we upgraded, we saw that there were objects on the radar that we were seeing the next day in this with this new radar that weren't there with the old radar.

1:04:23.420 --> 1:04:26.420
 And these were sometimes, you know, the same day you might go on two flights.

1:04:26.420 --> 1:04:31.420
 The one in the morning might be with the older radar, the one in the evening with the new radar.

1:04:31.420 --> 1:04:34.420
 And you, and you'd see the objects with the, with the new radar.

1:04:34.420 --> 1:04:36.420
 And that's not overly surprising in some sense.

1:04:36.420 --> 1:04:38.420
 They are more sensitive.

1:04:38.420 --> 1:04:44.420
 Perhaps they're not filtering out everything they should be yet, or perhaps there's some other type of error.

1:04:44.420 --> 1:04:47.420
 Maybe it needs to be calibrated, whatever.

1:04:47.420 --> 1:04:54.420
 It was relatively new and we were somewhat used to there being software problems with these types of things occasionally, just like anything else.

1:04:54.420 --> 1:04:58.420
 And so, okay, maybe this is a radar software malfunction.

1:04:58.420 --> 1:05:01.420
 We're getting some false tracks, as we call them.

1:05:01.420 --> 1:05:03.420
 What were you seeing?

1:05:03.420 --> 1:05:08.420
 And so what we would see are representations of the object.

1:05:08.420 --> 1:05:09.420
 So this is off of our radar.

1:05:09.420 --> 1:05:10.420
 We're not seeing a visual image here.

1:05:10.420 --> 1:05:14.420
 This is kind of like a, what's being displayed to us almost like in a gaming fashion, right?

1:05:14.420 --> 1:05:16.420
 Like our, the icon, right?

1:05:16.420 --> 1:05:19.420
 So the icon is showing us, hey, something is there.

1:05:19.420 --> 1:05:21.420
 And here's the parameters I can understand about it.

1:05:21.420 --> 1:05:22.420
 So this is in the cockpit.

1:05:22.420 --> 1:05:27.420
 There's a display that's showing some visualization with the radars detecting.

1:05:27.420 --> 1:05:28.420
 Correct.

1:05:28.420 --> 1:05:30.420
 And there's two different ways to do that.

1:05:30.420 --> 1:05:41.420
 The first one is like the actual data, like the radar where I am, it's showing me the data kind of as if it's in front of me and I'm selecting those contexts.

1:05:41.420 --> 1:05:47.420
 And there's another screen called the situational awareness page, and that's kind of a God's eye view that brings all that data into one spot.

1:05:47.420 --> 1:05:54.420
 And so I'm going to talk about this from the essay page, from the situational awareness page versus the individual radar ones, because it's easier.

1:05:54.420 --> 1:05:57.420
 But can you, sorry, sorry to linger on that.

1:05:57.420 --> 1:06:00.420
 So the individual displays are like first person.

1:06:00.420 --> 1:06:11.420
 And then the essay is when you say God's eye view is like from the top integration of all that information as if it's looking down onto the earth.

1:06:11.420 --> 1:06:12.420
 Yes.

1:06:12.420 --> 1:06:13.420
 Is that a good way to summarize it?

1:06:13.420 --> 1:06:14.420
 It is.

1:06:14.420 --> 1:06:22.420
 But for the aviator, it's slightly different because those two radar displays I talked about are at the bottom of that display is kind of representative of where I am.

1:06:22.420 --> 1:06:23.420
 And so I see what's in front of me.

1:06:23.420 --> 1:06:24.420
 Got it.

1:06:24.420 --> 1:06:29.420
 Whereas the situational awareness page, the aircraft is located in the center of that.

1:06:29.420 --> 1:06:37.420
 And then all around me, you know, based off of the data link and wherever I'm getting information from, I can see that whole awareness page.

1:06:37.420 --> 1:06:38.420
 I can see how it's situation.

1:06:38.420 --> 1:06:47.420
 So I'm going to kind of talk about this from the situational awareness page, which is a top down view, just to kind of frame our minds instead of jumping around.

1:06:47.420 --> 1:06:53.420
 And so what we would see out there is we'd see these indications that something would be there and they would have a track file.

1:06:53.420 --> 1:07:00.420
 That track file, that thing that represents the object has a line coming out of it and that represents, it's called the target aspect indicator.

1:07:00.420 --> 1:07:03.420
 There's some tracking from the radar.

1:07:03.420 --> 1:07:04.420
 Correct.

1:07:04.420 --> 1:07:05.420
 So it's showing you where the object's going.

1:07:05.420 --> 1:07:07.420
 This is all pretty cool that the radar can do all this.

1:07:07.420 --> 1:07:11.420
 So radar locks in on different objects and the tracks them over time.

1:07:11.420 --> 1:07:12.420
 Correct.

1:07:12.420 --> 1:07:13.420
 That's coming from the radar.

1:07:13.420 --> 1:07:14.420
 That's like built in feature.

1:07:14.420 --> 1:07:15.420
 Okay.

1:07:15.420 --> 1:07:16.420
 Cool.

1:07:16.420 --> 1:07:17.420
 Out there, we're seeing it.

1:07:17.420 --> 1:07:21.420
 We don't have to necessarily like pull things into our tracker in some sense, right?

1:07:21.420 --> 1:07:27.420
 Like it's all out there and then we can kind of choose to highlight on stuff or to kind of focus in on it more so.

1:07:27.420 --> 1:07:29.420
 But the information shall be out there.

1:07:29.420 --> 1:07:35.420
 And so we'd see that target aspect indicator, that line on a typical aircraft, you know, it would kind of look like this.

1:07:35.420 --> 1:07:36.420
 It would be coming out and it would go steady.

1:07:36.420 --> 1:07:40.420
 And if they turn, you know, it would be like, and you see them turn, right?

1:07:40.420 --> 1:07:50.420
 Like it's not magic, but this object, they would, the target aspect would kind of be like all over the place, like kind of randomly in a 360 degrees, you know, from that top down view.

1:07:50.420 --> 1:07:52.420
 That line would be in a place.

1:07:52.420 --> 1:07:56.420
 So kind of, you know, is it unable to determine the target aspect?

1:07:56.420 --> 1:07:57.420
 Is it stationary?

1:07:57.420 --> 1:08:00.420
 You know, and that's just how it puts it out and it's not used to seeing it.

1:08:00.420 --> 1:08:07.420
 So I'm not saying that's necessarily super weird, but it was different than what we were used to seeing because we weren't used to seeing stationary objects out there very much.

1:08:07.420 --> 1:08:13.420
 And what was also interesting is that these weren't just stationary on a zero wind day, right?

1:08:13.420 --> 1:08:20.420
 These are stationary at 20,000 feet, 15,000 feet, 500 feet, you know, with the wind blowing, you know.

1:08:20.420 --> 1:08:24.420
 And so much like the sea, you know, when we're up there fighting, it affects everything.

1:08:24.420 --> 1:08:29.420
 We consider the wind when we're, you know, shooting missiles, when we're flying or fuel considerations.

1:08:29.420 --> 1:08:33.420
 It's like operating, you know, in that volume of air, like the ocean, everything's going with the current.

1:08:33.420 --> 1:08:38.420
 And so anything that doesn't go with the current, you know, is immediately kind of identifiable and strange.

1:08:38.420 --> 1:08:42.420
 And that's why these were initially strangers because they would be stationary against the wind.

1:08:42.420 --> 1:08:47.420
 So if you had something like a good drone in a windy conditions, what would that look like?

1:08:47.420 --> 1:08:53.420
 Would it, it would have not come off a stationary? Would it sort of float about kind of thing?

1:08:53.420 --> 1:08:57.420
 No, I think with the drone technology we have today, they could stay within a pretty tight location.

1:08:57.420 --> 1:09:03.420
 Well, I meant like DJI drone, not like I'm saying like generically speaking, not a military drone.

1:09:03.420 --> 1:09:10.420
 No, I have a DJI drone myself even and, you know, maybe not a hundred knots, but if that thing's in 30 or 40 or not wins, you know,

1:09:10.420 --> 1:09:19.420
 the amount of distance it's going to be kind of doing one of these, like that change is not something I'm going to detect from maybe many miles away.

1:09:19.420 --> 1:09:20.420
 Interesting.

1:09:20.420 --> 1:09:22.420
 So it could look very stationary.

1:09:22.420 --> 1:09:28.420
 But that wasn't necessarily, what's interesting about this story is that there's not like the one smoking gun, right?

1:09:28.420 --> 1:09:29.420
 You have to kind of look at everything.

1:09:29.420 --> 1:09:39.420
 And that's what, you know, I don't like about the Department of Defense and just generally people's take on this is that everything is kind of based around a single image,

1:09:39.420 --> 1:09:41.420
 you know, or that one case.

1:09:41.420 --> 1:09:47.420
 But a lot of the interestingness comes from the duration or the time it's been out there, how they're interacting relative to other objects out there.

1:09:47.420 --> 1:09:54.420
 And you don't get that information when you just look at a frame for a second, you know, everyone kind of bites off on the shiny object.

1:09:54.420 --> 1:10:04.420
 So you yourself, from your particular slice of things you've experienced and seen directly or indirectly, you've kind of built up an intuition about what are the things that were being seen?

1:10:04.420 --> 1:10:05.420
 I want to go that far.

1:10:05.420 --> 1:10:12.420
 I've just been able to, you know, eliminate some variables because of how long I've observed it.

1:10:12.420 --> 1:10:16.420
 So like you said, yes, kind of drones stay in a particular position against the wind like that, certainly.

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:21.420
 But I don't think it can do that and then go.8 Mach for four hours after that, you know.

1:10:21.420 --> 1:10:30.420
 And so when you look at it outside of that one, that moment in time, then it eliminates a lot of the potential things that could be at least from my perspective.

1:10:30.420 --> 1:10:33.420
 So what kind of stuff did you see in the instruments?

1:10:33.420 --> 1:10:41.420
 We'd see them flying in patterns, kind of racetrack patterns or circular patterns or just going kind of straight east.

1:10:41.420 --> 1:10:53.420
 Occasionally see them supersonic 1.1, 1.2 Mach, but typically.6 to.8 Mach just for extremely extended periods of time, you know, essentially all the time.

1:10:53.420 --> 1:10:57.420
 And this is airspace where there's not supposed to be anything else at all.

1:10:57.420 --> 1:10:58.420
 And it's pretty far out there.

1:10:58.420 --> 1:11:01.420
 It starts 10 miles off the coast, goes like 300 miles.

1:11:01.420 --> 1:11:03.420
 Can you say the location that we're talking about?

1:11:03.420 --> 1:11:05.420
 Off the coast of Virginia Beach.

1:11:05.420 --> 1:11:06.420
 Got it.

1:11:06.420 --> 1:11:08.420
 And so nobody is supposed to be out there.

1:11:08.420 --> 1:11:10.420
 It's possible for people to be there.

1:11:10.420 --> 1:11:15.420
 It's not necessarily restricted, but it's well monitored and we're out there every day all day.

1:11:15.420 --> 1:11:17.420
 And so, you know, people know to stay clear.

1:11:17.420 --> 1:11:19.420
 If a session goes bumbling in there, everyone's going to know about it.

1:11:19.420 --> 1:11:23.420
 FAA is going to, you know, call them out, going to tell us about it.

1:11:23.420 --> 1:11:30.420
 So, incursions happen, not a big deal, but they're pretty rare, honestly, because everyone knows the area and we've been operating there first.

1:11:30.420 --> 1:11:37.420
 And what are the trajectories at 0.6 to 0.8 Mach that these objects were taking?

1:11:37.420 --> 1:11:44.420
 Typically, they would be in some type of circular pattern or kind of a racetrack pattern when they were at those speeds.

1:11:44.420 --> 1:11:49.420
 Or I just see them kind of, and it wasn't always like a mechanical flight description.

1:11:49.420 --> 1:11:54.420
 And when I say that, I mean like an autopilot is going to be just very precise, right?

1:11:54.420 --> 1:11:55.420
 It's going to be locked on straight.

1:11:55.420 --> 1:12:00.420
 And whereas I could see an airplane, I could tell if the pilot's flying it, right? Because it's not going to be perfect.

1:12:00.420 --> 1:12:01.420
 The computer's not controlling it.

1:12:01.420 --> 1:12:03.420
 And these seemed more like that.

1:12:03.420 --> 1:12:07.420
 Not that they were imprecise, but that they were even much more erratic than that.

1:12:07.420 --> 1:12:09.420
 So, like, it wasn't like a straight line in a turn.

1:12:09.420 --> 1:12:14.420
 It was just kind of like a, you know, a weird drift like that in that direction, you know.

1:12:14.420 --> 1:12:19.420
 So, it wasn't controlled by a down computer, not the suspected computers.

1:12:19.420 --> 1:12:22.420
 So, it wasn't controlled by autopilot kind of technology.

1:12:22.420 --> 1:12:25.420
 That's not the sense that I got.

1:12:25.420 --> 1:12:28.420
 So, how many people have seen them in a squadron?

1:12:28.420 --> 1:12:31.420
 So, how many times were they seen?

1:12:31.420 --> 1:12:36.420
 How many were there times when there's multiple objects?

1:12:36.420 --> 1:12:40.420
 Once we started seeing them on the radar enough, and we would get close enough, we'd actually see them on our FLIR as well.

1:12:40.420 --> 1:12:44.420
 So, our advanced targeting pod.

1:12:44.420 --> 1:12:50.420
 It's essentially a infrared camera that we use for targeting mostly in the air to surface environment.

1:12:50.420 --> 1:12:52.420
 We don't use it in the air to air arena.

1:12:52.420 --> 1:12:55.420
 It's just not that good of a tool, frankly.

1:12:55.420 --> 1:13:01.420
 But we would see our energy emitting from that location where the radar was dropping us off.

1:13:01.420 --> 1:13:05.420
 So, you know, the radar, we'd lock onto the object and our sensors would all look there.

1:13:05.420 --> 1:13:10.420
 And so, then we could see that it's looking at that right piece of sky, but there's energy actually coming from there.

1:13:10.420 --> 1:13:13.420
 So, now we started thinking that, okay, maybe not radar malfunctions.

1:13:13.420 --> 1:13:16.420
 Maybe more, maybe something is physically here, of course.

1:13:16.420 --> 1:13:18.420
 And then people started to try to fly by and see it.

1:13:18.420 --> 1:13:24.420
 And at this point, you know, I would say maybe 80 to 90% of our squadron have probably seen one of these on the radar at this point.

1:13:24.420 --> 1:13:26.420
 Everyone was aware of it.

1:13:26.420 --> 1:13:31.420
 There was small communication, I think, between squadrons of the same area that had the same radar.

1:13:31.420 --> 1:13:36.420
 So, I knew it wasn't just our squadron for whatever strange reason, because they would be other squadrons to be out there.

1:13:36.420 --> 1:13:39.420
 And we would talk to them, like, hey, careful, there's an object.

1:13:39.420 --> 1:13:40.420
 Are you aware of that?

1:13:40.420 --> 1:13:42.420
 So, like, they would be aware of it.

1:13:42.420 --> 1:13:45.420
 And then, of course, people would want to go see what they look like, right?

1:13:45.420 --> 1:13:46.420
 So, people would try to fly by.

1:13:46.420 --> 1:13:47.420
 I try to fly by them.

1:13:47.420 --> 1:13:49.420
 I like how that's an of course.

1:13:49.420 --> 1:13:50.420
 Of course.

1:13:50.420 --> 1:13:52.420
 Of course you don't want to fly by it.

1:13:52.420 --> 1:14:00.420
 You know, there's an argument against that kind of perspective that maybe the thing is dangerous, so maybe we don't.

1:14:00.420 --> 1:14:05.420
 But perhaps that's part of the reason you want to fly by it is to understand better what it is if it's a threat.

1:14:05.420 --> 1:14:07.420
 We have a lot of context now that we did it back then, you know.

1:14:07.420 --> 1:14:11.420
 And so, it was still a, hey, is this a balloon? Is this a drone? You know, at a certain point.

1:14:11.420 --> 1:14:16.420
 And we're also aware of, you know, potential intelligence gathering operations that could be going on.

1:14:16.420 --> 1:14:18.420
 We're up there flying our tactics.

1:14:18.420 --> 1:14:19.420
 We're emitting.

1:14:19.420 --> 1:14:22.420
 We're practicing our EW, you know.

1:14:22.420 --> 1:14:24.420
 We're turning at particular times.

1:14:24.420 --> 1:14:25.420
 Like, there's stuff that can be learned.

1:14:25.420 --> 1:14:26.420
 It's not a secret.

1:14:26.420 --> 1:14:31.420
 And, you know, countries keep different fishing vessels and whatnot in international waters off there.

1:14:31.420 --> 1:14:35.420
 So, it's not exactly a secret that we're being observed out there.

1:14:35.420 --> 1:14:42.420
 So, to think that a foreign hospital or a foreign nation would want to, you know, somehow intercept information,

1:14:42.420 --> 1:14:49.420
 that's our radar signals or our jamming capabilities to try to break that down or understand it better,

1:14:49.420 --> 1:14:51.420
 be ready for that next fight.

1:14:51.420 --> 1:14:55.420
 I mean, that's what scares me about this scenario.

1:14:55.420 --> 1:14:58.420
 Because we didn't jump right to aliens or UFOs.

1:14:58.420 --> 1:15:01.420
 We thought, you know, this is a radar malfunction we need to be aware of.

1:15:01.420 --> 1:15:02.420
 It's a safety issue.

1:15:02.420 --> 1:15:11.420
 And then, you know, this could be a tactical problem right here because everything we do is based off a crypto and locations.

1:15:11.420 --> 1:15:13.420
 Everything is classified we do out there, right?

1:15:13.420 --> 1:15:17.420
 And so, over time, if you gather enough data about those fights and just monitor them forever,

1:15:17.420 --> 1:15:25.420
 just like some nations do with other pieces of technology or software, they could probably learn a lot.

1:15:25.420 --> 1:15:28.420
 And so, we have to be cognizant of the fact and defend against it.

1:15:28.420 --> 1:15:41.420
 So, what can you say about the other characteristics of these objects, like shape, size, texture, luminosity?

1:15:41.420 --> 1:15:43.420
 How else do you describe object?

1:15:43.420 --> 1:15:44.420
 Is there something that could be said?

1:15:44.420 --> 1:15:47.420
 So, you said, like, this is the Tech Town radar, step one.

1:15:47.420 --> 1:15:52.420
 Now, you have clear images that can give you a sense that it's actually a physical object.

1:15:52.420 --> 1:15:55.420
 What else can be said about those physical objects?

1:15:55.420 --> 1:16:00.420
 So, eventually, someone did see one with their own eyeballs, multiple people.

1:16:00.420 --> 1:16:04.420
 And they saw it in a somewhat interesting way.

1:16:04.420 --> 1:16:12.420
 The object presented itself at the exact altitude and geographic location of the entry points into our working areas.

1:16:12.420 --> 1:16:19.420
 So, we enter at a very specific point at a certain altitude and people leave the areas at the same point at a lower altitude.

1:16:19.420 --> 1:16:22.420
 Probably one of the busiest pieces of the sky on the eastern sea board.

1:16:22.420 --> 1:16:28.420
 So, two jets from my squad went out and they went flying and they entered the area where these objects went right between the aircraft.

1:16:28.420 --> 1:16:32.420
 So, they're flying in formation and the object went between the aircraft?

1:16:32.420 --> 1:16:33.420
 They went between the object, I think.

1:16:33.420 --> 1:16:35.420
 I don't think the object was moving.

1:16:35.420 --> 1:16:37.420
 I don't think it aggressively went at them.

1:16:37.420 --> 1:16:41.420
 I think it was located still there and then they flew through it.

1:16:41.420 --> 1:16:45.420
 But they didn't have it on their radar.

1:16:45.420 --> 1:16:48.420
 And that would, I think the radar might have been malfunctioning.

1:16:48.420 --> 1:16:49.420
 I don't know that for sure.

1:16:49.420 --> 1:16:50.420
 I would like to look into it.

1:16:50.420 --> 1:16:58.420
 But my supposition is that if their radar was malfunctioning, it would make sense that they wouldn't avoid the object that was there because they knew these were physical at that point.

1:16:58.420 --> 1:17:02.420
 And we would go up to these objects all the time and try to see them.

1:17:02.420 --> 1:17:03.420
 We couldn't see them.

1:17:03.420 --> 1:17:05.420
 And we didn't know what it was.

1:17:05.420 --> 1:17:07.420
 Were they just not there or being fooled?

1:17:07.420 --> 1:17:08.420
 Was something happening?

1:17:08.420 --> 1:17:11.420
 Were they moving, dropping altitude to last minute?

1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:14.420
 We're going by pretty quick, so it's difficult to tell.

1:17:14.420 --> 1:17:19.420
 But perhaps if his radar wasn't working, he wasn't receiving energy from the jet.

1:17:19.420 --> 1:17:21.420
 And the jet, of course, didn't know that it was there.

1:17:21.420 --> 1:17:31.420
 And so whatever the case was, they flew right by and they described it just as a dark gray or black cube inside a clear translucent sphere.

1:17:31.420 --> 1:17:37.420
 And the kind of the apex of the cube or touching the inside of that sphere.

1:17:37.420 --> 1:17:39.420
 That's an image that's haunting.

1:17:39.420 --> 1:17:41.420
 So what do they think it is?

1:17:41.420 --> 1:17:51.420
 Did they think at that moment that they is it just this kind of cloud of uncertainty that they just described me a geometric object?

1:17:51.420 --> 1:17:55.420
 It's not on radar, so it's unclear what it is.

1:17:55.420 --> 1:18:04.420
 What was the any kind of other description they've had of it in terms of the intuition from a pilot's perspective?

1:18:04.420 --> 1:18:07.420
 You have to kind of identify what a thing is.

1:18:07.420 --> 1:18:18.420
 To answer the first part, they actually canceled the flight and came back because they were like, if there's one of these out here and we're almost hitting them and it's right there, then perhaps we need to get a different jet with better radar.

1:18:18.420 --> 1:18:25.420
 So they came back and they're in their gear and they're talking to the front desk and talking to Skipper and like, hey, we almost hit one of those damn things out there.

1:18:25.420 --> 1:18:32.420
 And this kind of was one of those kind of slight watershed moments where we all were kind of like, all right, this is a serious deal now.

1:18:32.420 --> 1:18:37.420
 Maybe we thought they were balloons or drones or malfunctions or maybe we thought it was fine.

1:18:37.420 --> 1:18:43.420
 But at the end of the day, if we're going to hit one of these things, then we need to take care of the situation.

1:18:43.420 --> 1:18:53.420
 And that's actually when we started submitting hazard reports or hazard reps to the Naval Aviation Safety kind of communication network.

1:18:53.420 --> 1:19:03.420
 And it's not like a big proactive thing where people are going to investigate. It's more of a data collection mechanism so that you can kind of share that aggregate data and make sure that things are progressing.

1:19:03.420 --> 1:19:15.420
 So it wasn't a mechanism that would result in action being taken, but we were hoping to at least get the message out to whomever was maybe running a classified program that we were not aware of or something like that, that, hey, like you could kill somebody here.

1:19:15.420 --> 1:19:19.420
 Like you've grown too big for your bridges here. Take a step back.

1:19:19.420 --> 1:19:24.420
 So that was our concern at that point. That's kind of where we were thinking this was going.

1:19:24.420 --> 1:19:35.420
 What's the protocol for shooting at a thing? Was there a concern that it's a direct threat, not just surveillance, but a thing that could be a threat?

1:19:35.420 --> 1:19:45.420
 At least from my perspective, like that never really crossed into my mind. I thought it was potentially an intelligence failure that could be being watched and information gathered.

1:19:45.420 --> 1:19:52.420
 But I didn't think that it was something that would proactively engage me in a hostile manner.

1:19:52.420 --> 1:20:00.420
 It wouldn't really make sense either too. It would be shocking to have one of these objects take out an F18, but there's no real tactical advantage other than fear perhaps.

1:20:00.420 --> 1:20:08.420
 Psychological. I've learned a lot about the psychological warfare in Ukraine.

1:20:08.420 --> 1:20:20.420
 There's a big part of the war in terms of when you talk about siege warfare, about wars that last for many years, for many months, and then perhaps could extend to years.

1:20:20.420 --> 1:20:29.420
 But yes, it didn't seem, it didn't fit your conception of a threatening entity.

1:20:29.420 --> 1:20:31.420
 Correct.

1:20:31.420 --> 1:20:41.420
 So looking back now, from all the pieces of data you've integrated, you've personally added, what do you think it could be?

1:20:41.420 --> 1:20:48.420
 I don't know. I don't know what it could be. I think we've been able to categorize it successfully into a few buckets.

1:20:48.420 --> 1:21:02.420
 We've been able to say that this could be U.S. technology, that someone put in the wrong piece of sky or perhaps was developed and tested in an inappropriate spot by someone that wasn't being best practices.

1:21:02.420 --> 1:21:13.420
 Is there, sorry to interrupt, is there a sort of modularity to the way the military operates to where it's possible for one branch not to know about the test of another?

1:21:13.420 --> 1:21:26.420
 Yeah, I think it's perfectly reasonable to think that that could occur, right? And so if we just make that assumption, we can integrate that into our analysis here and just say, okay, but at the point we're at now, we have to assume that that's not the case, right?

1:21:26.420 --> 1:21:36.420
 With everything that's been going on and the statements that have been made and the hearings, I think that if it was a noncommunication issue, we're in big trouble at this point.

1:21:36.420 --> 1:21:42.420
 What about it being an object from another nation, from China, from Russia?

1:21:42.420 --> 1:21:52.420
 Or even one of our allies, perhaps, right? Maybe that's, you know, I don't think it's controversial to say that our allies could be gathering information about us or anything of that nature.

1:21:52.420 --> 1:22:00.420
 But that would be an extreme case, but I think it's just important to say, right, to not just say Russia or China and just call them the bad guys and assume that if they don't have it, no one can do it.

1:22:00.420 --> 1:22:10.420
 And so from my perspective, you know, anyone else, anyone else, and it doesn't necessarily need to be a foreign power, it could be a nongovernment entity, perhaps, although I think that's very unlikely.

1:22:10.420 --> 1:22:18.420
 But again, these are things you must consider if you kind of throw everything other than the U.S. under scrutiny.

1:22:18.420 --> 1:22:29.420
 But, you know, from what has been reported and the behaviors that have been seen, it would be, I would expect to see remnants of that technology elsewhere in the economy.

1:22:29.420 --> 1:22:43.420
 There seems to be too many things that require advanced technology that would be beneficial commercially as well as in other military applications for it to be completely locked away by one of our competitors.

1:22:43.420 --> 1:22:54.420
 Now, I could see us perhaps locking something away if we're already in the lead and having it to pull out as needed, but for someone that's perhaps in a power struggle and they're in second place,

1:22:54.420 --> 1:23:00.420
 they might be more aggressive with the development of different types of technology willing to accept bigger risks.

1:23:00.420 --> 1:23:05.420
 Do you think it could be natural phenomena that we don't yet understand?

1:23:05.420 --> 1:23:09.420
 I think that there are a number of things that this is going to be, right?

1:23:09.420 --> 1:23:14.420
 I don't think there's one thing at the end of the day, but I certainly think that that is part of what some of this could be.

1:23:14.420 --> 1:23:22.420
 I don't think it's what we were seeing on the East Coast, and I don't think it is related to the Roosevelt incident, or I'll even go out and say the Nimitz incident.

1:23:22.420 --> 1:23:24.420
 What's the Roosevelt incident?

1:23:24.420 --> 1:23:29.420
 The Roosevelt incident typically referred to as the gimbal and or the GoFast video.

1:23:29.420 --> 1:23:35.420
 And then the Nimitz is from what the David Fraver has witnessed directly and spoken about.

1:23:35.420 --> 1:23:42.420
 We'll talk about that as well. I just love to get your sort of interpretation of those incidents.

1:23:42.420 --> 1:23:50.420
 But yeah, so in this particular case, natural phenomena could be a part of the picture, but you're saying not the whole picture.

1:23:50.420 --> 1:23:53.420
 Yes, and we can't discount it.

1:23:53.420 --> 1:23:59.420
 The other thing is, what about the failure of pilot eyesight?

1:23:59.420 --> 1:24:10.420
 Sort of some deep mixture of actual direct human vision system failure and psychology.

1:24:10.420 --> 1:24:20.420
 Like seeing something weird and then filling in the gaps because in order to make sense of the weird.

1:24:20.420 --> 1:24:30.420
 I've tried to expose myself to scenarios like that that I don't naturally think are right, but I've explored them to see if they could have some truth.

1:24:30.420 --> 1:24:36.420
 And one example is, let's imagine a scenario where if we're seeing these objects every day off the East Coast,

1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:47.420
 I can imagine a technology or an operation where you had some type of traditional propulsion system operating drones in order to gather data like we had discussed.

1:24:47.420 --> 1:24:56.420
 And I could envision a clever enough adversary that could perhaps destroy or somehow remove these objects and replace them with new objects,

1:24:56.420 --> 1:25:02.420
 essentially when we're not looking, right? And that accounts for the large airborne time.

1:25:02.420 --> 1:25:11.420
 And so I explore options like that and I try to see what evidence and assumptions need to be made in order to prove or disprove that.

1:25:11.420 --> 1:25:16.420
 And you would need so much infrastructure. You need so many assets.

1:25:16.420 --> 1:25:20.420
 And so I try to explore some of those fallacies and some of those concerns.

1:25:20.420 --> 1:25:27.420
 And as aviators, we're trained into many actual physical eyesight and kind of illusion training.

1:25:27.420 --> 1:25:34.420
 Like at nighttime flying, there's so many things that can happen flying with false horizons. And so we receive hours of training on that type of stuff.

1:25:34.420 --> 1:25:38.420
 But this just falls outside the category from my perspective.

1:25:38.420 --> 1:25:42.420
 What was the visibility conditions when in the times when people were able to see it?

1:25:42.420 --> 1:25:49.420
 And we just earlier discussed complete nighttime darkness.

1:25:49.420 --> 1:25:52.420
 In this case, was it during the day?

1:25:52.420 --> 1:25:56.420
 It was a perfectly clear day that particular incident.

1:25:56.420 --> 1:26:07.420
 In a world that's full of mystery, I have to ask, what do you think is the possibility that it's not of this earth origin?

1:26:07.420 --> 1:26:10.420
 I like the term nonhuman intelligence in a sense.

1:26:10.420 --> 1:26:19.420
 Because again, there's so much, there's a lot of assumptions in there that may cause us to go down the wrong roads.

1:26:19.420 --> 1:26:26.420
 These could be something that our weather phenomenon of earth or something else that is just something we don't understand.

1:26:26.420 --> 1:26:29.420
 I can't imagine right now that's still of this earth.

1:26:29.420 --> 1:26:36.420
 If we consider extraterrestrials or something that came from a physical place far away in space time,

1:26:36.420 --> 1:26:40.420
 that leads us to some detection assumptions that we would need to make.

1:26:40.420 --> 1:26:48.420
 And so I just try to not categorize it under anything and just say, hey, is this demonstrating intelligence and start from there as a single object?

1:26:48.420 --> 1:26:50.420
 What can we learn about it kinematically?

1:26:50.420 --> 1:26:51.420
 How it's performing?

1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:53.420
 What does that mean for its energy source?

1:26:53.420 --> 1:26:55.420
 What does that mean for the G forces inside?

1:26:55.420 --> 1:26:59.420
 And then step it out a level and say, okay, how are these interacting with our fighters?

1:26:59.420 --> 1:27:02.420
 If they are, how are they interacting with the weather and their environment?

1:27:02.420 --> 1:27:04.420
 How are they interacting with each other?

1:27:04.420 --> 1:27:08.420
 So can we look at these and how they're interacting perhaps as a swarm?

1:27:08.420 --> 1:27:12.420
 Especially off the east coast where this is happening all the time with multiple objects.

1:27:12.420 --> 1:27:18.420
 And so we might be able to determine some things about their maybe, you know, center capabilities or the areas of focus,

1:27:18.420 --> 1:27:22.420
 you know, if we can determine how they're working in conjunction with each other.

1:27:22.420 --> 1:27:27.420
 But, you know, seeing one little flash of an object doesn't provide that type of insight.

1:27:27.420 --> 1:27:31.420
 But we have the systems for it, and it's kind of made on irony,

1:27:31.420 --> 1:27:39.420
 but it's a fact of life to reality that many of these well deployed, highly capable systems are held under the military umbrella,

1:27:39.420 --> 1:27:43.420
 which makes it difficult to provide that data for scientific analysis.

1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:50.420
 So there's probably a lot more data on these objects that's not being, that's not made available,

1:27:50.420 --> 1:27:54.420
 probably even within the military for analysis.

1:27:54.420 --> 1:27:58.420
 I think so. Yeah, I think there's a lot of data that could be made available.

1:27:58.420 --> 1:28:05.420
 And, you know, that's one of the reasons why, you know, I've been engaged with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics

1:28:05.420 --> 1:28:12.420
 to build, you know, a large resources of cross domain expertise so that if or when that data is available,

1:28:12.420 --> 1:28:18.420
 or that there's additional analysis needed, you know, we can spin up those teams and make that analysis.

1:28:18.420 --> 1:28:24.420
 So there was a recently a House Intelligence Subcommittee hearing on UFOs that you were a part of.

1:28:24.420 --> 1:28:30.420
 What was the goal of that hearing? And can you maybe summarize what you heard?

1:28:30.420 --> 1:28:36.420
 The hearings from my perspective seemed a bit disingenuous, kind of top level.

1:28:36.420 --> 1:28:39.420
 I think... Who was it run by? Sorry to interrupt.

1:28:39.420 --> 1:28:43.420
 Like, who were the people involved and what was the goal, the state of goal?

1:28:43.420 --> 1:28:49.420
 Congressman Andre Carson did chair of the committee and he was, I think, ultimately responsible for bringing it all together.

1:28:49.420 --> 1:28:55.420
 You know, I think the intent from Congress was to try to bring light to what has been happening with the Navy

1:28:55.420 --> 1:29:02.420
 and to help show the American people that Congress is taking this serious because something serious is happening.

1:29:02.420 --> 1:29:05.420
 But, you know, the sense I got seemed a bit disingenuous.

1:29:05.420 --> 1:29:11.420
 They talked around it a lot. They, you know, advertised their love of science fiction.

1:29:11.420 --> 1:29:19.420
 But they, you know, they didn't treat this, I would say, in the manner it deserved as a potential tactical threat if it's coming from a foreign power.

1:29:19.420 --> 1:29:25.420
 And I get it, though, at the same day, they have very specific objectives within the DOD, right?

1:29:25.420 --> 1:29:30.420
 They have a very important job. Their job isn't necessarily to do exploratory science for no reason.

1:29:30.420 --> 1:29:37.420
 So I applaud and I encourage their efforts on the intelligence side to help understand this.

1:29:37.420 --> 1:29:43.420
 But my concern is that they play a role they're not well suited for, which is doing science.

1:29:43.420 --> 1:29:49.420
 And the Pentagon has opened a new office to investigate UFOs called All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.

1:29:49.420 --> 1:30:05.420
 What do you think about this office? Do you think it can help alleviate in a way which this hearing perhaps has failed to improve more of the scientific rigor and the seriousness of investigating UFOs?

1:30:05.420 --> 1:30:12.420
 I think that remains to be seen. I think it's a step in the right direction, but it's a step that was taken because the previous step didn't happen.

1:30:12.420 --> 1:30:20.420
 So the AOI MSG was the progeny, essentially, of the AARRO or ARRO.

1:30:20.420 --> 1:30:31.420
 And the name was changed because nothing was happening and it was essentially just a confusing mess of words that were created to make this topic unpalatable.

1:30:31.420 --> 1:30:39.420
 The airborne object identification synchronization management group, quite the mouthful. I practice that.

1:30:39.420 --> 1:30:48.420
 But the new All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, from my perspective at least, at least the perspective that they're putting out, they seem to want to be open.

1:30:48.420 --> 1:30:54.420
 They've put out a Twitter handle. They're going out on Twitter and communicating saying they want to keep this open.

1:30:54.420 --> 1:30:57.420
 But that's going to run into a classification wall.

1:30:57.420 --> 1:31:02.420
 Well, so Dr. Sean Kropachuk seems like an interesting guy.

1:31:02.420 --> 1:31:04.420
 He does, yes.

1:31:04.420 --> 1:31:15.420
 So Evan looked in too deeply, but he seems to have sort of, he's coming from like a science research background.

1:31:15.420 --> 1:31:25.420
 So he might be, at least in the right mindset, the right background to kind of lead a serious investigation.

1:31:25.420 --> 1:31:32.420
 I think so. I'll just say generally, the office has been receptive to AIAA reaching out in order to collaborate,

1:31:32.420 --> 1:31:34.420
 which has been a positive sign.

1:31:34.420 --> 1:31:41.420
 I'll also pass the same kudos to Dr. Spurgle and NASA's effort as well.

1:31:41.420 --> 1:31:44.420
 I see these organizations that are standing up.

1:31:44.420 --> 1:31:53.420
 I do see them as good faith efforts that are coming about through a lot of difficulty and negotiation, most likely.

1:31:53.420 --> 1:32:03.420
 And I see these as a small door opening that, if we can take advantage of, can lead to a much more productive relationship between these organizations.

1:32:03.420 --> 1:32:05.420
 How do you put pressure on this kind of thing?

1:32:05.420 --> 1:32:12.420
 Does it come from the civilian leadership? Does it come from sort of Congress and presidents? Does it come from the public?

1:32:12.420 --> 1:32:15.420
 Does the public have any power to put pressure on this?

1:32:15.420 --> 1:32:22.420
 Or is the giant wall of bureaucracy going to protect it against any public pressure? What do you think?

1:32:22.420 --> 1:32:29.420
 I think we've been in that latter state for a while, but society seems to be a bit different nowadays.

1:32:29.420 --> 1:32:37.420
 We have the ability to communicate and to group and to form relationships in a way that haven't been able to be present in the past.

1:32:37.420 --> 1:32:43.420
 We've been able to do research for better or worse on our own in a way that hasn't been able to happen before.

1:32:43.420 --> 1:32:54.420
 And so I sense that people are a bit less willing to kind of buy the bottom line statement from those in power as they used to be back when they didn't have access to those tools.

1:32:54.420 --> 1:33:01.420
 And so I do think there is a massive role for the general society, general populace to play to show that they are interested in this.

1:33:01.420 --> 1:33:16.420
 Because it's not that I don't think the politicians or the leaders in the Pentagon, it's not that they don't like this topic necessarily or think it's toxic per se, but they exist in a culture where this has been toxic and they don't feel comfortable talking about it.

1:33:16.420 --> 1:33:22.420
 And these are people that have spent their entire careers working towards a goal and getting to very high positions within government.

1:33:22.420 --> 1:33:27.420
 And so this is very against their nature to take a stance on a topic like this.

1:33:27.420 --> 1:33:36.420
 And so the fact that these are standing up, even if they do have a small budget or if they struggled a bit at first, I still think it's a massive change.

1:33:36.420 --> 1:33:41.420
 And it's a big step away from that stigma that has been pervading this topic for so long.

1:33:41.420 --> 1:33:53.420
 And you're actually part of alleviating this stigma for somebody that's as credible, as intelligent, as like varied in background, able to speak about these things.

1:33:53.420 --> 1:33:59.420
 It's a big risk that you took, but it's extremely valuable because it's alleviating the stigma.

1:33:59.420 --> 1:34:02.420
 I thank you for saying that, but it didn't feel like much of a risk for me.

1:34:02.420 --> 1:34:06.420
 I didn't come out about aliens or whatever.

1:34:06.420 --> 1:34:09.420
 I had a safety problem that I started asking questions about.

1:34:09.420 --> 1:34:18.420
 And I went down a road as a Navy trained aviation safety officer that sent me to school for six weeks and Pensacola would be a safety officer.

1:34:18.420 --> 1:34:24.420
 We're almost hitting these objects and it's not something that happened in the past and we want to understand it.

1:34:24.420 --> 1:34:25.420
 It's happening right now.

1:34:25.420 --> 1:34:27.420
 These occurrences are still happening.

1:34:27.420 --> 1:34:30.420
 Aviators are flying right now, are still flying by these things.

1:34:30.420 --> 1:34:34.420
 And in fact, I mentioned I was an instructor pilot.

1:34:34.420 --> 1:34:42.420
 I had a student call me about eight months ago or so and he's like, hey, sir, I made it to the fleet finally.

1:34:42.420 --> 1:34:49.420
 I had trained him how to fly and then he goes to F 18, he goes another year of training and then he gets out to his squadron on the east coast.

1:34:49.420 --> 1:34:57.420
 And he's flying with a senior member of the base in the S Oceana where the fighters fly out of senior five or six.

1:34:57.420 --> 1:34:59.420
 And it was kind of a bad weather day.

1:34:59.420 --> 1:35:05.420
 And so they said, hey, you know, if the weather is not good enough for us to do this dogfighting set, we'll go out and do a UAP hunt.

1:35:05.420 --> 1:35:09.420
 You know, see if we can't find anything to take a look at them, you know, I don't know if it was in jest or not.

1:35:09.420 --> 1:35:18.420
 But, you know, this, they actually would say it's not just because there were there were notices that were being briefed about this being a safety hazard at this point.

1:35:18.420 --> 1:35:23.420
 And so now that I think about it, it likely wasn't just long story short, they went flying.

1:35:23.420 --> 1:35:25.420
 The weather was too bad.

1:35:25.420 --> 1:35:30.420
 They did go on a UAP hunt and they physically saw one, you know, and he called me up and say, hey, sir, I saw a Cuban sphere.

1:35:30.420 --> 1:35:32.420
 They're still out here, you know, years later.

1:35:32.420 --> 1:35:37.420
 And so it's almost like a generational issue, you know, for these fighter pilots, at least on these coasts.

1:35:37.420 --> 1:35:39.420
 But that's great that they can talk about it, right?

1:35:39.420 --> 1:35:40.420
 Exactly. Exactly.

1:35:40.420 --> 1:35:41.420
 They feel at least comfortable.

1:35:41.420 --> 1:35:43.420
 They have a reporting mechanism.

1:35:43.420 --> 1:35:55.420
 And so that was one of the problems that I noticed that we have a lot of reporting mechanisms to take care of safety issues and even tactical issues when the time's right in order to keep track of what's going on.

1:35:55.420 --> 1:35:58.420
 But there's no way to communicate about this.

1:35:58.420 --> 1:36:02.420
 Sure, we could submit a hazard report, but nothing's actually being investigated.

1:36:02.420 --> 1:36:08.420
 And if this is a tactical vulnerability or something more, it deserves attention.

1:36:08.420 --> 1:36:19.420
 If I could ask your sort of take your opinion of the different UFO sightings that the DOD has released videos on.

1:36:19.420 --> 1:36:25.420
 So what do you think about the Tic Tac UFO that David Fraver and others have cited?

1:36:25.420 --> 1:36:28.420
 That's a truly anomalous experience.

1:36:28.420 --> 1:36:39.420
 I can't do like mental models in my head to find potential solutions to discredit that, right?

1:36:39.420 --> 1:36:50.420
 Because as much as I try, right, just as a logical process, as a practice, I can't pick it apart in the way that we were just talking about a moment ago about, you know, thousands of drones being like sent up in very tricky manners, right?

1:36:50.420 --> 1:36:57.420
 I can't really bring myself to a clever solution that, you know, other than just saying the pilots are lying or is error, you know?

1:36:57.420 --> 1:37:02.420
 And I believe, you know, I know Dave Fraver, you know, like I said, I'm a friend, we talk a lot.

1:37:02.420 --> 1:37:07.420
 I have zero reason to disbelieve anything he says.

1:37:07.420 --> 1:37:10.420
 Yeah, I agree with you.

1:37:10.420 --> 1:37:19.420
 But in terms of the actual UFO, is there something anomalous and interesting to you about that particular case?

1:37:19.420 --> 1:37:30.420
 Maybe one interesting aspect there is how much do I understand about the water surface and underwater aspects of these UFOs?

1:37:30.420 --> 1:37:39.420
 It seems like a lot of the discussion is about the movement of this particular thing that seems to be weird anomalous, seems to defy physics.

1:37:39.420 --> 1:37:43.420
 But what about stuff that's happening underwater? That's interesting to me.

1:37:43.420 --> 1:37:51.420
 If I had advanced technology, I would certainly like to operate in part underwater because you can hide a lot of stuff there.

1:37:51.420 --> 1:37:56.420
 You think it would be somewhat as easy as traveling through interstellar space, at least, right?

1:37:56.420 --> 1:37:58.420
 Yeah.

1:37:58.420 --> 1:38:04.420
 You know, I wish I had a great answer for that, but as an aviator, that's kind of a black box for us.

1:38:04.420 --> 1:38:08.420
 We don't have great what I would call cross domain tracking, right?

1:38:08.420 --> 1:38:11.420
 I can't see something go underwater and then follow it underwater.

1:38:11.420 --> 1:38:15.420
 So it's literally not your domain, underwater, like leave that for somebody else.

1:38:15.420 --> 1:38:19.420
 Yeah. I use that terminology because it's kind of important, right?

1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:23.420
 Cross domain tracking is something that we haven't had to necessarily worry about, right?

1:38:23.420 --> 1:38:30.420
 Because the airplanes operated in the air and submarines operated underwater and space planes operating in space, right?

1:38:30.420 --> 1:38:37.420
 But that's going to blur, I think, as we move along here, especially in the air and space regime.

1:38:37.420 --> 1:38:48.420
 And being able to perhaps transition my radar contact at 40,000 feet to another radar system that can track it up to 200,000 feet, you know, that might be a value.

1:38:48.420 --> 1:38:50.420
 And so we seem to be missing that right now.

1:38:50.420 --> 1:38:54.420
 So what about the Go Fast and the gimbal videos that you mentioned earlier?

1:38:54.420 --> 1:38:57.420
 There was like, what's interesting there to you?

1:38:57.420 --> 1:39:00.420
 So the gimbal, I'll talk about that one first.

1:39:00.420 --> 1:39:02.420
 I was airborne for that one.

1:39:02.420 --> 1:39:05.420
 The person that recorded it was a good friend of mine.

1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:11.420
 But I mean, both their crew, I knew both of them, but the the wizard himself, very close friends, went through a lot of our training together.

1:39:11.420 --> 1:39:13.420
 We went to the same fleet squadron.

1:39:13.420 --> 1:39:19.420
 He ended up transitioning to be a pilot and then came to where I was instructing.

1:39:19.420 --> 1:39:22.420
 So I got to instruct him a bit on his transition.

1:39:22.420 --> 1:39:28.420
 And, you know, the way that was was we went out on a air to air training mission.

1:39:28.420 --> 1:39:36.420
 So simulating a air fight against our own guys, they're acting like the bad guys and kind of go head to head against each other.

1:39:36.420 --> 1:39:39.420
 And when we fly on those missions, we all fly out together, more or less.

1:39:39.420 --> 1:39:45.420
 We set up and then we kind of a trite from the fight as we either, you know, run out of gas or something happens.

1:39:45.420 --> 1:39:48.420
 And so people usually go back onesies or twosies.

1:39:48.420 --> 1:39:54.420
 And so the air crew that recorded the gimbal, they were going back to the boat and we were on what's called a workup training event.

1:39:54.420 --> 1:40:06.420
 And so this is like a month on the boat where we're essentially conducting more time operations, more or less to stress ourselves out and to kind of do the last training block before we go on deployment, essentially.

1:40:06.420 --> 1:40:08.420
 So it's pretty high stress.

1:40:08.420 --> 1:40:15.420
 They actually do send aircraft from like land bases to kind of try to penetrate and we're expected to go intercept them.

1:40:15.420 --> 1:40:17.420
 And so we're kind of practicing like we play.

1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:26.420
 And so he saw these objects on the radar, the gimbal and a fleet of other aircraft or vehicles.

1:40:26.420 --> 1:40:34.420
 And they initially thought it was part of the training exercise that they were sending something in to try to penetrate the airspace.

1:40:34.420 --> 1:40:36.420
 And so they, you know, they flew over to it.

1:40:36.420 --> 1:40:45.420
 And as they got close enough to get on the FLIR, you know, I think everyone has heard the reaction and they realized that it wasn't something they were expecting to see.

1:40:45.420 --> 1:40:49.420
 Can you actually describe what's in the video and what's your reaction in case they haven't seen it?

1:40:49.420 --> 1:40:50.420
 Yeah, a lot of swearing.

1:40:50.420 --> 1:40:58.420
 But so what you see on the FLIR footage is a black or white, depending on when you look at it, object that's somewhat shaped like a gimbal.

1:40:58.420 --> 1:41:09.420
 It appears almost as if someone put two plates together and then there seems to be almost like a small funnel of IR energy at the top of the bottom of those plates in a sense.

1:41:09.420 --> 1:41:14.420
 So almost as if, you know, there's a stick going in between two plates, but not that pronounced, right?

1:41:14.420 --> 1:41:17.420
 So there's an energy field that kind of went to a funnel on the top and the bottom.

1:41:17.420 --> 1:41:20.420
 At least that's how it's being portrayed on the FLIR.

1:41:20.420 --> 1:41:26.420
 There's a lot of conversation about that being glare or things of that nature, but it was actually a very tight IR image.

1:41:26.420 --> 1:41:30.420
 It just was nondescript shape, which was interesting.

1:41:30.420 --> 1:41:32.420
 Typically we would see the skin of the aircraft.

1:41:32.420 --> 1:41:36.420
 We can see the flames coming out of the exhaust, especially at those ranges.

1:41:36.420 --> 1:41:39.420
 And there was no flames or there's no exhaust here?

1:41:39.420 --> 1:41:40.420
 There was no exhaust.

1:41:40.420 --> 1:41:45.420
 There was no, you know, there was no outgassing of repellent in any manner, right?

1:41:45.420 --> 1:41:49.420
 It was just an object that had nothing emitting from it that was stationary in the sky.

1:41:49.420 --> 1:41:53.420
 Well, not stationary, but it was moving along a path, right?

1:41:53.420 --> 1:41:55.420
 It wasn't falling out of the sky.

1:41:55.420 --> 1:41:56.420
 And it continued along.

1:41:56.420 --> 1:42:02.420
 If we were to consider it from a God's eye view again on the SA page, it continued along in a path.

1:42:02.420 --> 1:42:06.420
 And from the perspective that top down view, it just went in another direction.

1:42:06.420 --> 1:42:12.420
 So no instantaneous direction change from that perspective.

1:42:12.420 --> 1:42:18.420
 You also hear them, you know, very excitedly talking on the tapes about, you know, whatever the heck this thing is.

1:42:18.420 --> 1:42:22.420
 And look at the SA, there's a whole formation of them.

1:42:22.420 --> 1:42:25.420
 And so the SA is a situational awareness page.

1:42:25.420 --> 1:42:29.420
 And again, it's a large display that gives that God's eye view of all the radar contacts.

1:42:29.420 --> 1:42:37.420
 So the video is actually showing just one and then they're speaking about many of them on the SA display.

1:42:37.420 --> 1:42:38.420
 Correct.

1:42:38.420 --> 1:42:45.420
 And what they essentially saw was if we were to consider above the object north, so kind of offset to the north of the object.

1:42:45.420 --> 1:42:53.420
 There was a formation of about somewhere between four and six of these objects in a rough wedge formation, you know, so kind of side by side like this.

1:42:53.420 --> 1:42:58.420
 And again, not in a like autopilot type manner where it was very stiff.

1:42:58.420 --> 1:43:02.420
 It was very kind of non mechanical, the flight mechanics again.

1:43:02.420 --> 1:43:11.420
 And these objects were in that formation and they were going along and then they turned pretty sharply, but they still had a radius of turn and then went back in the opposite direction.

1:43:11.420 --> 1:43:14.420
 And during that turn, they were kind of like all over the place.

1:43:14.420 --> 1:43:15.420
 Like it wasn't tight.

1:43:15.420 --> 1:43:20.420
 They weren't even like super, they weren't flying in a way I would expect them to be flying in relation to a flight lead.

1:43:20.420 --> 1:43:26.420
 They were flying as if they were flying close to each other, but not in formation, which was kind of strange, right?

1:43:26.420 --> 1:43:32.420
 And then when they rolled out, they kind of tightened back up like so when they basically they started that turn and then 180 degrees out.

1:43:32.420 --> 1:43:37.420
 Essentially, they start flowing in the opposite direction and kind of got back in that formation.

1:43:37.420 --> 1:43:41.420
 And while that was happening, the gimbal object was proceeding was a left to right.

1:43:41.420 --> 1:43:49.420
 And as as those the formation kind of turned up to the north and was just passing back it, the gimbal just kind of went back in the opposite direction.

1:43:49.420 --> 1:43:53.420
 So to follow it back in that direction.

1:43:53.420 --> 1:43:58.420
 And in the in the flare itself, you know, you see the object changes orientation quite a bit.

1:43:58.420 --> 1:44:03.420
 So you see it more or less level maybe candid about 45 degrees.

1:44:03.420 --> 1:44:09.420
 And then you see it kind of moving around like this almost as if it was a gimbal.

1:44:09.420 --> 1:44:19.420
 I've come to learn after some, you know, having seen some research online and people really looking into this that it seemed that the object actually climbed during that maneuver.

1:44:19.420 --> 1:44:24.420
 And so the reason it looked like it turned immediately is because it turned like this.

1:44:24.420 --> 1:44:27.420
 It turns in a vertical fashion like that, which was pretty interesting.

1:44:27.420 --> 1:44:37.420
 That's kind of like another example of a flight mechanics that we don't normally operate because we don't change our directions by maneuvering in the vertical.

1:44:37.420 --> 1:44:46.420
 If we can help it, it's you just kill in the fuel, you know, and so if you're like surveillance platform looking to spend as much time around something,

1:44:46.420 --> 1:44:50.420
 you're not going to, you know, climb 500 feet every time you make a turn.

1:44:50.420 --> 1:44:52.420
 Unless you're Tom Cruise.

1:44:52.420 --> 1:44:54.420
 Unless you're Tom Cruise naturally.

1:44:54.420 --> 1:45:05.420
 Okay. So is that one of the more impressive flight mechanics you've seen in the video in video forms or not the direct eyesight reports, but like in terms of video evidence that we have?

1:45:05.420 --> 1:45:10.420
 I think so. We were seeing a lot of these, but we weren't just going on recording all day.

1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:12.420
 We just kind of put them in that safety bucket.

1:45:12.420 --> 1:45:16.420
 Like, all right, there's objects over there. We're just not going to go near it, you know?

1:45:16.420 --> 1:45:18.420
 And so we weren't putting our sensors on them that much.

1:45:18.420 --> 1:45:24.420
 We were gathering the data kind of secondarily, but we weren't primarily focusing on it to see all the details.

1:45:24.420 --> 1:45:28.420
 So that's so fascinating because you have a busy day. You have a lot to do.

1:45:28.420 --> 1:45:31.420
 All right. Well, there's some weird stuff going on there.

1:45:31.420 --> 1:45:32.420
 We're just not going to go there.

1:45:32.420 --> 1:45:41.420
 And that says something about sort of the, about human nature, about the way that bureaucracy is functioning, the way the military functions.

1:45:41.420 --> 1:45:51.420
 It fills up your day with busy, important things and you don't get to, I mean, that is something that I'm in a sort of absurd way worry about,

1:45:51.420 --> 1:46:01.420
 which is like we fill our days with so much busyness than when truly beautiful things happen, whatever they are, truly anomalous things.

1:46:01.420 --> 1:46:07.420
 We just won't pay attention because they don't fit our busy schedule.

1:46:07.420 --> 1:46:16.420
 Beautiful. I think that's right on the nose and it's on my nose because, you know, I didn't give this topic the attention it deserved until I left, right?

1:46:16.420 --> 1:46:21.420
 Until I left and I went to be an instructor pilot where I had more time.

1:46:21.420 --> 1:46:27.420
 You know, I had more downtime to kind of process and think and get out of exactly what you just described.

1:46:27.420 --> 1:46:31.420
 And that's kind of what broke me out of it and got me thinking more about it.

1:46:31.420 --> 1:46:34.420
 Why do you think the DOD released these videos?

1:46:34.420 --> 1:46:39.420
 That's a great question. Did the DOD release or they kind of get out on their own in some sense?

1:46:39.420 --> 1:46:47.420
 So I don't know the answer to that question, but my understanding of the situation is that the DOD talked about them so much because they're already out there in a sense.

1:46:47.420 --> 1:46:52.420
 And so, you know, they had a choice where they could have just straight up lied and said it wasn't theirs or it was fake.

1:46:52.420 --> 1:46:59.420
 But again, I think our culture now is too open and the information moves too freely to do things like that.

1:46:59.420 --> 1:47:02.420
 And it kind of left them in a pickle that they had to respond to.

1:47:02.420 --> 1:47:08.420
 So what was the role of Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Intelligence Program, ATIP?

1:47:08.420 --> 1:47:14.420
 From your perspective, from what you know, baby, your intuition is ATIP a real thing that existed?

1:47:14.420 --> 1:47:19.420
 I was in a position as an aviator that never would have exposed me to anything like that.

1:47:19.420 --> 1:47:22.420
 But I was curious about what people knew.

1:47:22.420 --> 1:47:27.420
 And I think in my mind maybe you hoped someone was looking into this in some sense.

1:47:27.420 --> 1:47:34.420
 But on the day that Gimbal was recorded, I heard that they caught something extra interesting on the FLIR.

1:47:34.420 --> 1:47:41.420
 And I went to the Intel Deep Reef space to go see the film.

1:47:41.420 --> 1:47:43.420
 And, you know, everyone's gathered around watching it, very interesting.

1:47:43.420 --> 1:47:45.420
 And I heard the admals coming down.

1:47:45.420 --> 1:47:49.420
 And so I was like, I'm going to hang out back, you know, quietly, mind my own business and see.

1:47:49.420 --> 1:47:55.420
 I just want to see his reaction and try to read it to see if this is brand new or if it is something that they've been dealing with, you know.

1:47:55.420 --> 1:47:58.420
 And, you know, he came in and he watched a video for like five or six seconds.

1:47:58.420 --> 1:47:59.420
 And he went, hmm.

1:47:59.420 --> 1:48:01.420
 And I turned around and walked out.

1:48:01.420 --> 1:48:03.420
 And I was like, he's definitely seen these before.

1:48:03.420 --> 1:48:07.420
 There's no way that you only watch that for a few seconds and don't have more interest.

1:48:07.420 --> 1:48:09.420
 It was, you know, too bizarre.

1:48:09.420 --> 1:48:12.420
 So kind of going back, does the office exist?

1:48:12.420 --> 1:48:23.420
 Well, you know, I've heard that the admals essentially reported back to the Pentagon about that case real time essentially after he left, right?

1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:30.420
 So he basically went back and I was told he reported that to either ATIP directly or to other, you know, somehow the information got there.

1:48:30.420 --> 1:48:36.420
 So from my perspective and from what I've experienced, it seems like, yes, it was a thing.

1:48:36.420 --> 1:48:40.420
 But, you know, as an aviator, I wouldn't know either way, right?

1:48:40.420 --> 1:48:41.420
 That's just my experience from what happened.

1:48:41.420 --> 1:48:45.420
 But it seems like there's somewhere to report to.

1:48:45.420 --> 1:48:49.420
 At the time, it seemed like there was at least some place to complain to.

1:48:49.420 --> 1:48:50.420
 It's not report to.

1:48:50.420 --> 1:48:59.420
 Let me ask you about sort of people that are taking a serious look at the videos and just the different UFO sighting reports.

1:48:59.420 --> 1:49:08.420
 So there's a person named Meg West who is a skeptic and tries to take a skeptical view on every single piece of evidence on these UFO sightings.

1:49:08.420 --> 1:49:10.420
 What do you think about his analysis?

1:49:10.420 --> 1:49:30.420
 He tries to analyze in a way that debunks some of these videos and assign probabilities to their explanations, sort of leaning towards things that give a very low probability to alien extraterrestrial type of explanations for these UFOs.

1:49:30.420 --> 1:49:34.420
 What do you think about his approach to these analysis?

1:49:34.420 --> 1:49:36.420
 Well, two parts to his approach.

1:49:36.420 --> 1:49:40.420
 One, I commend him for all the good work and effort he put into it.

1:49:40.420 --> 1:49:43.420
 I've seen him build some models and things of that nature.

1:49:43.420 --> 1:49:47.420
 And so I think that's something that's absolutely needed in this environment.

1:49:47.420 --> 1:49:50.420
 No one's asking anyone to believe anyone here, right?

1:49:50.420 --> 1:49:54.420
 Trust but verify should certainly be the mantra.

1:49:54.420 --> 1:50:02.420
 But where I have, you know, a disagreement with his approach is that he's approaching from, you know, from a skeptic or from a debunker standpoint.

1:50:02.420 --> 1:50:16.420
 And, you know, from my perspective, not speaking for everyone, but when I hear that, that tells me that you're driving towards a particular conclusion, which has been a very safe process for the past X years, right?

1:50:16.420 --> 1:50:23.420
 It's been a very safe business to be in to tell people that they haven't seen aliens, but times have changed a little bit.

1:50:23.420 --> 1:50:36.420
 And the tactics I've seen to try to retain that view on reality has included things such as completely dismissing what the aircrew are saying.

1:50:36.420 --> 1:50:42.420
 And I think that is a fallacy to think that we have to take the human outside of that analysis.

1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:44.420
 So those are the two things I disagree with.

1:50:44.420 --> 1:50:54.420
 When you put the night vision on and you look at the stars and you look out there in the vast cosmos, only a small fraction of which we can see.

1:50:54.420 --> 1:50:59.420
 How many intelligent alien civilizations do you think are out there? Do you think about this kind of stuff?

1:50:59.420 --> 1:51:00.420
 I do.

1:51:00.420 --> 1:51:03.420
 You know, I'm of the theory that we are not the only people out there.

1:51:03.420 --> 1:51:10.420
 I think it would be a statistically silly comment to assume we are, although I get that we are the only data point that we currently have.

1:51:10.420 --> 1:51:17.420
 Although I'm willing to jump over that fence and say that, yes, there most likely is intelligent life elsewhere.

1:51:17.420 --> 1:51:26.420
 Although I can see that it is a possibility we are early or it could be limited or it could be in a manner that we don't recognize or can really understand.

1:51:26.420 --> 1:51:36.420
 I spend so much time thinking about how we anthropomorphize things on this UFO topic and we've done it to ourselves with media in a sense, right?

1:51:36.420 --> 1:51:41.420
 We've trained ourselves what to think about, what we think is true or what this would be like.

1:51:41.420 --> 1:51:50.420
 And by doing so, I think we're closing ourselves off to a lot of what the possibilities could be and the things that we could miss.

1:51:50.420 --> 1:51:57.420
 You beautifully put that the thing that drew you to fighter jets is the technology.

1:51:57.420 --> 1:52:13.420
 If you were to think, to imagine from an alien perspective, what kind of technologies would we first encounter as human beings if we were to meet another alien civilization in the next few centuries?

1:52:13.420 --> 1:52:16.420
 What kind of thing would we see?

1:52:16.420 --> 1:52:20.420
 So you're now at the cutting edge and you see the quick progress that's happening.

1:52:20.420 --> 1:52:26.420
 That was happening throughout the 20th century that's happening now with greater degrees of autonomy with robots and that kind of stuff.

1:52:26.420 --> 1:52:28.420
 What do you think we will encounter?

1:52:28.420 --> 1:52:34.420
 I think we're going to see the ability to manipulate matter like we used to manipulate information.

1:52:34.420 --> 1:52:45.420
 I think that's what, whether that means being able to pop something on the table that didn't exist or to influence a chemical reaction somewhere,

1:52:45.420 --> 1:52:50.420
 but being able to manipulate and treat matter as if it was information.

1:52:50.420 --> 1:53:02.420
 Being able to design specific materials, being able to move past a lot of the barriers that seem to limit our progress with things such as miniaturized fusion or even just fusion in general,

1:53:02.420 --> 1:53:10.420
 a lot of it is matter based, is material based and our ability to not manipulate.

1:53:10.420 --> 1:53:13.420
 We can only discover materials in a sense.

1:53:13.420 --> 1:53:20.420
 I think that a complete mastery of physical reality would be one of the key traits of a very intelligent species.

1:53:20.420 --> 1:53:27.420
 You're actually working on some, maybe you can correct me, but quantum mechanical simulation to understand materials.

1:53:27.420 --> 1:53:46.420
 Do you see the early steps that we're doing on the quantum computing side to start to simulate, to deeper understand materials, but maybe to engineer and to mess with materials at the very low level that aliens will be able to do and hopefully humans will be able to do soon?

1:53:46.420 --> 1:53:57.420
 Yeah, I think that's, you know, so if we think about how what materials are made of, it's just a collection of atoms, but each one of those atoms has a lot of data associated with it.

1:53:57.420 --> 1:54:06.420
 So if we want to kind of calculate how they interact with each other, it requires a massive amount of computational resources, so much so that it can't be done in a lot of cases with classical computers.

1:54:06.420 --> 1:54:09.420
 And that's where quantum computers come in.

1:54:09.420 --> 1:54:21.420
 So we don't have a perfectly functioning quantum computer at this point. One of the things that we're working at at quantum general materials is to essentially bridge that gap between what classical computer can do as far as simulating materials.

1:54:21.420 --> 1:54:26.420
 And of course, what a fully functioning quantum computer would mean for being able to design materials.

1:54:26.420 --> 1:54:35.420
 And so, you know, having the ability to study matter at a very fundamental level and unleashing artificial intelligence and machine learning on that problem.

1:54:35.420 --> 1:54:47.420
 I think is, you know, in a sense, you know, alien in a way that we're able to advance our science using, you know, a process that we may not fully understand with a perhaps a non human based intelligence in some sense.

1:54:47.420 --> 1:54:58.420
 And so we may find patterns in the processes, right? How does our machine learning output, you know, can we match behaviors with what we're observing with what maybe a machine learning output, right?

1:54:58.420 --> 1:55:02.420
 Can we try to classify the intelligence in that manner, perhaps?

1:55:02.420 --> 1:55:08.420
 So, you know, at GenMaths, we're looking at these materials. We're considering what these algorithms could have used for later on.

1:55:08.420 --> 1:55:17.420
 Could we perhaps reverse the process and determine what a unique or anomalous material, what type of properties it potentially could have.

1:55:17.420 --> 1:55:19.420
 And you said GenMath, right?

1:55:19.420 --> 1:55:20.420
 Mm hmm.

1:55:20.420 --> 1:55:22.420
 What's, what is GenMath?

1:55:22.420 --> 1:55:28.420
 GenMath is a quantum generative material. So it's the company I work for.

1:55:28.420 --> 1:55:38.420
 We essentially are working on a couple of verticals. One of them is our quantum chemistry work. We're essentially, we're bridging the gap between essentially physics and chemistry.

1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:47.420
 We're working on those problems and, and again, implementing artificial intelligence machine learning into that process so that we can design those materials from the ground up.

1:55:47.420 --> 1:55:55.420
 Additionally, we are what we consider a vertically integrated material science company, which means we can generate our own data.

1:55:55.420 --> 1:56:02.420
 And so, within the next quarter coming up, we are launching a satellite in the space.

1:56:02.420 --> 1:56:16.420
 They'll have a fairly advanced hyperspectral sensor in there, which is intended to be the first launch that will help us detect different types of materials using our advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry, right?

1:56:16.420 --> 1:56:19.420
 We're going to be leveraging that experience in order to better analyze that data.

1:56:19.420 --> 1:56:26.420
 Oh, interesting. So materials that are strange or novel out there in space.

1:56:26.420 --> 1:56:30.420
 Not necessarily, but we'll be looking back at Earth to be able to detect mineral deposits on Earth.

1:56:30.420 --> 1:56:31.420
 Got it.

1:56:31.420 --> 1:56:35.420
 Got it. Got it. Getting the greater perspective from out in space to do analysis of different materials.

1:56:35.420 --> 1:56:36.420
 That's right.

1:56:36.420 --> 1:56:37.420
 Interesting.

1:56:37.420 --> 1:56:51.420
 Yeah, I was really impressed by the DeepMind. I got to hang out at DeepMind recently and they really impressed me at the possibility of the application as you're saying of machine learning in the context of quantum mechanical simulation for materials.

1:56:51.420 --> 1:56:53.420
 So to understand materials.

1:56:53.420 --> 1:56:56.420
 It's, it's really, really, really interesting.

1:56:56.420 --> 1:56:59.420
 So manipulate matter, huh?

1:56:59.420 --> 1:57:16.420
 I would say the next thing is horses, right? Or maybe fields. So, you know, manipulating or managing gravity. Can we, you know, maneuver within fields in some manner that allows us to perhaps move propellantless or in other manners, right?

1:57:16.420 --> 1:57:30.420
 And so I think essentially having a deeper understanding of, you know, different fields and being able to interact with them, I think would be, you know, a potential avenue for, you know, travel or advanced travel, right?

1:57:30.420 --> 1:57:40.420
 Propel less travel. Can we, can we quantum entangle gravity fields together and propel a ship by, you know, the gravity field of a planet, the mass of a planet and a drive on a ship?

1:57:40.420 --> 1:57:42.420
 You know, this is all sorts of interesting things.

1:57:42.420 --> 1:57:53.420
 But yeah, people look back at people like you and say, well, they used to fly like with this kind of propellant, it seems like to be a very antiquated way of flying.

1:57:53.420 --> 1:58:04.420
 And they were very impressed with themselves, these humans that they could fly like birds. It's like so much energy is used to fly such short distances from that perspective.

1:58:04.420 --> 1:58:06.420
 We can only throw so many rocks at the back.

1:58:06.420 --> 1:58:07.420
 Yeah.

1:58:07.420 --> 1:58:08.420
 There needs to be a better way.

1:58:08.420 --> 1:58:09.420
 Exactly.

1:58:09.420 --> 1:58:14.420
 The game's dumb. Like these, it's like Flintstones or something like that.

1:58:14.420 --> 1:58:16.420
 We'll get good at it, but there's a limit, right?

1:58:16.420 --> 1:58:17.420
 Like we need to do something.

1:58:17.420 --> 1:58:24.420
 I mean, that's an interesting sort of trade off. How much do you invest in getting really good at it?

1:58:24.420 --> 1:58:38.420
 I tend to believe the reason why it would be very important and very powerful to put a human on Mars is not necessarily for the exploration facet, but in all the different technologies that come from that.

1:58:38.420 --> 1:58:47.420
 So there's something about putting humans in extreme conditions where we figure out how to make it less extreme, more comfortable.

1:58:47.420 --> 1:58:57.420
 And for that, we invent things like the DoD sort of helping invent the internet and all the different technologies we've invented.

1:58:57.420 --> 1:59:06.420
 It's almost like an indirect consequence of solving difficult problems, whether that problem means winning wars or colonizing other planets.

1:59:06.420 --> 1:59:17.420
 And so I don't think Mars will help us figure out proportional systems or to crack open physics to where you can travel close to the speed of light or faster than the speed of light.

1:59:17.420 --> 1:59:22.420
 But it will help us figure out how to build some cool technology here on Earth, I think.

1:59:22.420 --> 1:59:32.420
 So I'm a big proponent of doing really difficult things, really difficult engineering things to see what kind of technologies emerge from that.

1:59:32.420 --> 1:59:43.420
 But let me ask you this, do you think U.S. government is hiding some technology like alien spacecraft technology?

1:59:43.420 --> 1:59:46.420
 I have no information either way.

1:59:46.420 --> 1:59:49.420
 And if you did, you probably wouldn't tell me.

1:59:49.420 --> 1:59:52.420
 But my assumptions, like what did my heart tell me?

1:59:52.420 --> 1:59:56.420
 My heart tells me something's going on, but I have no evidence for that.

1:59:56.420 --> 2:00:06.420
 Maybe that's me wanting something to go on, maybe that's a human feeling to want to know in my government's in control of what some strange unknown thing is.

2:00:06.420 --> 2:00:15.420
 What's your sense if such a thing happened with this kind of information leak, would this kind of information be released by the government?

2:00:15.420 --> 2:00:26.420
 I mean, that's the worry that you have is because when you don't understand a thing in its novel, you want to hide it so that some kind of enemy doesn't get access to it and use it against you.

2:00:26.420 --> 2:00:29.420
 I wonder if that is the underlying assumption.

2:00:29.420 --> 2:00:36.420
 It's the one people always jump to, to maintain secrecy of technology, and I assume that's part of it.

2:00:36.420 --> 2:00:40.420
 I wonder if there's any other reasons that we wouldn't want to not talk about it.

2:00:40.420 --> 2:00:47.420
 I imagine that in such information would have a shock to these social economic system of any country of not the world.

2:00:47.420 --> 2:00:53.420
 And so I wonder if perhaps that was part of the concern as well, how society can react to it.

2:00:53.420 --> 2:01:02.420
 Maybe we're anti fragile enough now with everything that's going on and with our communication networks that, you know, why not now?

2:01:02.420 --> 2:01:03.420
 I don't know.

2:01:03.420 --> 2:01:06.420
 But that's something I think about as well.

2:01:06.420 --> 2:01:26.420
 Yeah, the effect on the mass psyche of something like this, that there's another intelligence out there with trouble enough to deal with the pandemic, to have something of this scale,

2:01:26.420 --> 2:01:37.420
 basically having just an inkling of a phenomena that we have no understanding of and could lead to complete destruction of human civilization or a flourishing of it.

2:01:37.420 --> 2:01:39.420
 And what do you do?

2:01:39.420 --> 2:01:42.420
 What does a bureaucracy of government do with that?

2:01:42.420 --> 2:01:51.420
 Yeah, especially when they're the ones holding the range of power in such a communication would relinquish that power, essentially some degree.

2:01:51.420 --> 2:02:07.420
 Since you think there's aliens out there and you're somebody that's thought about war quite a bit, do you think alien civilizations, when we meet them would want war?

2:02:07.420 --> 2:02:10.420
 Would they be a danger to us?

2:02:10.420 --> 2:02:12.420
 Would they be a friend to us?

2:02:12.420 --> 2:02:16.420
 What's your intuition about intelligences out there?

2:02:16.420 --> 2:02:26.420
 My intuition tells me that when two people like yourself and myself or anyone get together, often the output is greater than individuals.

2:02:26.420 --> 2:02:35.420
 And when we work together, we can typically do things that are more impressive and better than if a single person works alone.

2:02:35.420 --> 2:02:46.420
 And now I know that war has driven technological progress, but perhaps there's other mechanisms that can do so.

2:02:46.420 --> 2:02:55.420
 But regardless, I wonder if we truly think about an advanced society that has been perhaps thousands or millions of years ahead of us,

2:02:55.420 --> 2:03:07.420
 I would imagine that same truth to be there, that people working together, creatures working together is a good thing for society or its society as a whole.

2:03:07.420 --> 2:03:20.420
 And if we consider that, as we imagine a society growing and expanding, in a sense the ultimate output of a planet could only be achieved in some senses if everyone was working towards the same goal.

2:03:20.420 --> 2:03:29.420
 And there might be wonders and secrets and things that we can't imagine just simply because of the time frames that we live under and we think in.

2:03:29.420 --> 2:03:36.420
 But if a planet has a single unit and it almost is as an entity itself at a certain level, right?

2:03:36.420 --> 2:03:44.420
 If everything's working towards the same output, I could almost imagine an intelligent species that approached us planet to planet instead of person to person

2:03:44.420 --> 2:03:51.420
 because that's how they've evolved and they've assumed any intelligent species would understand that working together is better than not.

2:03:51.420 --> 2:04:05.420
 And so my heart tells me that at a certain point, love and caring and desire to work together is much more powerful than the technological progress that war would bring.

2:04:05.420 --> 2:04:07.420
 I hope so as well.

2:04:07.420 --> 2:04:16.420
 Well, let me jump to the AI topic that you've done. So you've done research and development efforts focused on multi agent intelligence for collaborative autonomy,

2:04:16.420 --> 2:04:25.420
 machine learning AI stuff that we've been talking about for combat, for air to air combat, man done man teaming technologies, all that kind of stuff.

2:04:25.420 --> 2:04:30.420
 What's some interesting ideas in this space that fascinate you?

2:04:30.420 --> 2:04:40.420
 Randomness, you know, being able to not predict what the enemy is doing, almost no matter what, because there's a level of randomness that's within the tactical envelope.

2:04:40.420 --> 2:04:42.420
 Even utility of randomness.

2:04:42.420 --> 2:04:44.420
 The utility of randomness in an increasing.

2:04:44.420 --> 2:04:47.420
 Sounds like a book you should write.

2:04:47.420 --> 2:04:50.420
 I don't know if you could title. Name my band.

2:04:50.420 --> 2:04:52.420
 Name your band. Yeah.

2:04:52.420 --> 2:05:03.420
 So yeah, can you elaborate that? So like trying to deeper understand how you can integrate randomness through AI in the context of combat.

2:05:03.420 --> 2:05:15.420
 In order to make yourself, in order to take away the enemy's ability to try to predict what you're going to do to disrupt their technological progress cycles so that they don't have a clear target to aim at.

2:05:15.420 --> 2:05:22.420
 And if you don't clear target to aim at, it's hard to hit it. Additionally, more distribution of assets and capability.

2:05:22.420 --> 2:05:37.420
 So imagine being able to digitally model your, your weapon or your system or your entire tactical engagement or scenario, or allow machine learning to help you better understand the technology that you need to build in order to defeat a particular scenario.

2:05:37.420 --> 2:05:41.420
 Right. And I'm talking hardware now, not just the tactic itself.

2:05:41.420 --> 2:05:55.420
 And, you know, being able to use large amounts of simulation and machine learning to build individual assets that are small boutique using advanced mania or factoring techniques for mission or for particular battle.

2:05:55.420 --> 2:06:02.420
 Right. Instead of just having these large things against an enemy, you're building systems and technology for individual cases.

2:06:02.420 --> 2:06:10.420
 What about manned and unmanned teaming? So man and machine working together. Is there interesting ideas there?

2:06:10.420 --> 2:06:19.420
 I approach it from the position that the human should be commanding from the highest level possible. Right.

2:06:19.420 --> 2:06:29.420
 So mission, objective, base, targeting. And so if, just for example, if there's a building here and I want that building to go away, that's the message I want to communicate.

2:06:29.420 --> 2:06:33.420
 I don't want to tell certain vehicles to be in a certain spot. I don't want to know how much fuel they have.

2:06:33.420 --> 2:06:41.420
 I don't even want to know what capabilities they have necessarily. I just want to know that I have the ability to select from a cloud of capabilities.

2:06:41.420 --> 2:06:54.420
 And the right assets are going to arrive such that they deal with the contingencies around the target such as protection systems or EW and then can prosecute the target to the high enough probability of satisfaction that's needed by the mission.

2:06:54.420 --> 2:07:03.420
 And that's the power of the human mind is it's able to do some of these strategic calculations, but also ethical calculations, all that kind of stuff.

2:07:03.420 --> 2:07:14.420
 Exactly. That's what humans are good at. Does it worry you, a future where we have increasingly higher autonomy in our weapon systems, in our war?

2:07:14.420 --> 2:07:26.420
 So you said building. What about telling a set of fully autonomous drones to get rid of all the terrorists in the city?

2:07:26.420 --> 2:07:35.420
 So you see multiple buildings, region, that kind of, so greater and greater autonomy.

2:07:35.420 --> 2:07:48.420
 So that's a fear, right? You're viewing it from a, we can cover more perspective, which is fair and a lot of, I don't approach it from that topic.

2:07:48.420 --> 2:07:58.420
 At least I don't think of it that way, at least morally. I think that with the advancement of warfare, assuming we have a just and moral leadership.

2:07:58.420 --> 2:08:08.420
 If that's the case, then I am an advocate for increased autonomy and technology because I see it as an ability to be more precise.

2:08:08.420 --> 2:08:20.420
 And if we trust the moral leadership of our government, then we would want to be as precise as possible in order to mitigate effects that we don't want.

2:08:20.420 --> 2:08:29.420
 So I know that's not a satisfying answer and it leaves us maybe with bad feelings, but...

2:08:29.420 --> 2:08:46.420
 No, because having experienced sort of directly seeing what it looks like when deliberately or carelessly war leads to the death of a large number of civilians as it does currently in Ukraine.

2:08:46.420 --> 2:08:53.420
 The value of precision given ethical leadership becomes apparent.

2:08:53.420 --> 2:09:00.420
 So there's something distinctly unethical about the murder of civilians in a time of war.

2:09:00.420 --> 2:09:05.420
 And I think technology helps lessen that.

2:09:05.420 --> 2:09:15.420
 Of course, all death is terrible, but there's something about schools, hospitals being destroyed with everybody inside.

2:09:15.420 --> 2:09:20.420
 Being killed is particularly terrible.

2:09:20.420 --> 2:09:29.420
 It is. And you approach it from the angle of more autonomy enables a wider swath of destruction.

2:09:29.420 --> 2:09:34.420
 And that's where we get back into who's making the decisions based off of this.

2:09:34.420 --> 2:09:42.420
 And my hope, again, would be that we would have the leadership that would use these things when needed in the precise way as possible to minimize that.

2:09:42.420 --> 2:09:45.420
 And I've seen that firsthand. I've seen that in country.

2:09:45.420 --> 2:09:57.420
 I've seen not blue forces, but I've seen truck bombs go off on school buses driving around Afghanistan while escorting convoys.

2:09:57.420 --> 2:10:03.420
 And it wasn't easy then, and I'm sure it's not any easier now, especially after what you've just seen.

2:10:03.420 --> 2:10:11.420
 Do you have thoughts about the current war in Ukraine, maybe from a military perspective, maybe from the air force perspective?

2:10:11.420 --> 2:10:13.420
 So I can just mention a few things.

2:10:13.420 --> 2:10:17.420
 There's the barricade drones that are being used.

2:10:17.420 --> 2:10:23.420
 They're unmanned. I think they have capability to be autonomous, but they're usually remotely controlled.

2:10:23.420 --> 2:10:28.420
 They're used for reconnaissance, but they're also used by the Ukraine side for reconnaissance.

2:10:28.420 --> 2:10:35.420
 And I think also to destroy different technology tanks and so on, different targets like this.

2:10:35.420 --> 2:10:39.420
 So there's also on the Russian side, the war on 10.

2:10:39.420 --> 2:10:46.420
 There's the fighter jets, MiG 29 in the Ukraine side and the Su 25 in the Russian side.

2:10:46.420 --> 2:10:54.420
 Is there anything kind of stands out to you about this particular aspects of what this war looks like that's unique to what you've experienced?

2:10:54.420 --> 2:10:58.420
 Maybe not unique, but it's just been absolutely incredible to see the footage.

2:10:58.420 --> 2:11:06.420
 I mean, we're watching war on Twitter, essentially, and to see these aircraft flying down low,

2:11:06.420 --> 2:11:14.420
 and flares out, getting shot down. It's incredible to see this happening live for everyone to see.

2:11:14.420 --> 2:11:16.420
 So that's just kind of a quick meta comment.

2:11:16.420 --> 2:11:25.420
 But as far as the actual, I think these small form factor UAVs where they're just like strapping weapon to it and flying over and trying to drop it at the right time,

2:11:25.420 --> 2:11:33.420
 or any of these type of commercial applications of technology into this ad hoc warfare area is incredibly interesting.

2:11:33.420 --> 2:11:40.420
 It shows how useful that technology can be outside of the military, especially like DJI.

2:11:40.420 --> 2:11:48.420
 There's obviously a lot of technology in there being leveraged for other capabilities within PLC military, or at least we would assume.

2:11:48.420 --> 2:11:52.420
 What happens if that is more widespread?

2:11:52.420 --> 2:11:56.420
 What if we were creating our own drones and they were being used against us?

2:11:56.420 --> 2:11:59.420
 Would we want to have some type of kill switch or something like that?

2:11:59.420 --> 2:12:08.420
 I think governments are going to have to consider all these tools that are going to be easily available to just any person could be turned into a tool of war.

2:12:08.420 --> 2:12:10.420
 How do we stop that from being turned against us?

2:12:10.420 --> 2:12:18.420
 Especially as we look at 10 years from now when we have a large number of autonomous UAVs delivering packages and doing everything else over our country,

2:12:18.420 --> 2:12:22.420
 and any one of those could be potentially a weapon if we don't have the proper security.

2:12:22.420 --> 2:12:33.420
 Well, we're now in Texas and Texas values its guns and sees guns as among other things a protector of individual freedom.

2:12:33.420 --> 2:12:41.420
 You can see a future perhaps where, and I've certainly experienced this in the empowering nature of this in Ukraine,

2:12:41.420 --> 2:12:51.420
 where you can put the fight for independence into your own hands by literally strapping explosives to DJI drones.

2:12:51.420 --> 2:12:53.420
 That you purchase in your own salary.

2:12:53.420 --> 2:13:03.420
 One of the interesting things about the voluntary army in Ukraine is that they're basically using their own salary to buy the ammunition to fight for their independence.

2:13:03.420 --> 2:13:12.420
 It's the very kind of ideal that people speak about when they speak about the Second Amendment in this country.

2:13:12.420 --> 2:13:32.420
 It's interesting to see the advanced technology version of that, especially in Ukraine, using computer vision technology for surveillance and reconnaissance to try to integrate that information to discover the targets and all that kind of stuff.

2:13:32.420 --> 2:13:45.420
 To put that in the hands of civilians, it's fascinating to see, to sort of fight for their independence. You could say that to fight against authoritarian regime of your own government, all that kind of stuff.

2:13:45.420 --> 2:13:53.420
 It shows you how complicated the war space in the future is going to be, you know, invading a land like that where people have, you know, that many different types of resources.

2:13:53.420 --> 2:13:55.420
 Absolutely changed warfare.

2:13:55.420 --> 2:14:07.420
 I mean, hopefully that creates a disincentive to start war, to go to war with a, yeah, sort of it changes the nature of guerrilla warfare.

2:14:07.420 --> 2:14:36.420
 You know, I don't think Putin was expecting to be in that engagement quite as long as he has, of course, but it can show you how you can get caught up. You know, if land wars turn into an inescapable quagmire each time due to the complications around the society's ability to access interesting tools, you know, it could be, you know, it could be a huge demotivator for aggression.

2:14:36.420 --> 2:14:50.420
 Well, let me ask you about this. Do you think there will always be war in the world? Is this just a part of human nature?

2:14:50.420 --> 2:15:05.420
 I think so. I think it is. Until we move past resource limitation, there's always going to be at least that one particular cause of conflict.

2:15:05.420 --> 2:15:21.420
 And then we can also consider all our psychological lizard brain emotions that cause us to act out, although, you know, we're hopefully we have enough things in place to stop that from rising to the level of war.

2:15:21.420 --> 2:15:25.420
 But, you know, we have our own biology, our own psychology and evolution to combat.

2:15:25.420 --> 2:15:36.420
 And then, but there are pragmatic reasons to exert violence sometimes, unfortunately, in that one of those cases could be resource limitations. And so your question was, do I think there will always be war in this world?

2:15:36.420 --> 2:15:46.420
 My unfortunate answer is perhaps yes, but once there's more than one world and we're less resource constrained, then perhaps it'll be a valve of sorts for that.

2:15:46.420 --> 2:15:57.420
 I talked to Jaco on this podcast and I told him about a song called Brothers in Arms by Dire Straits.

2:15:57.420 --> 2:16:08.420
 And the question I asked him, I'd like to ask you the same question, is like the song goes, do you think we're fools to wage war on our brothers in arms?

2:16:08.420 --> 2:16:16.420
 And Jaco said, our enemy is not our brothers in arms, they're the enemy.

2:16:16.420 --> 2:16:29.420
 And so this kind of notion that we're all human, that's a notion, that's a luxury you can have, but there is good and bad in this world, according to Jaco.

2:16:29.420 --> 2:16:47.420
 I hear that anger and hate when I was in Ukraine, among some people, where there was a sense where you could be brothers and sisters, you can have family, you can have love from Ukraine to Russia.

2:16:47.420 --> 2:16:54.420
 But now that everything changed and generational hate for some people have taken over.

2:16:54.420 --> 2:17:04.420
 So I guess the question is, when you think about the enemy, is there hate there? Do you acknowledge that they're human?

2:17:04.420 --> 2:17:10.420
 I had never had any hate or discontent when I was doing my job, I'll say.

2:17:10.420 --> 2:17:18.420
 But I was also never in a true life or death situation where they were going to kill me if I didn't kill them.

2:17:18.420 --> 2:17:25.420
 But I think that environment isn't one born out of hate, being in that type of scenario.

2:17:25.420 --> 2:17:31.420
 And since it's how to be alive, our natural state is fighting for survival in a sense.

2:17:31.420 --> 2:17:41.420
 And so I think there's great power and strength and clarity perhaps in that, and it's not always born out of hate but out of necessity, and we can't always control that.

2:17:41.420 --> 2:17:51.420
 And I think as we focus on ourselves so much, we only dance on that pinhead when we find ourselves fighting for things that we need.

2:17:51.420 --> 2:17:54.420
 And we're always taking from someone else at this point.

2:17:54.420 --> 2:18:02.420
 And so as someone that's been in combat and very high above it, I'll say, right, where I didn't feel like I was in particular danger,

2:18:02.420 --> 2:18:13.420
 I rationalized it and I made my way through it knowing that there were people on the other side that were going to die that were on our side than not.

2:18:13.420 --> 2:18:21.420
 So it was always a very human thing. It was never a reaction, an emotional reaction of any sense.

2:18:21.420 --> 2:18:36.420
 So you were able to see the basic, it's human versus human. There's some aspect of war that is basically one people fighting each other.

2:18:36.420 --> 2:18:46.420
 Yes. At the end of the day, especially I would say in aviation, tactical aviation, there's almost a kinship with your enemies in a sense,

2:18:46.420 --> 2:18:54.420
 because you know them in a sense, right? You know what they've been through, you know what training they've been through, you know where they've failed,

2:18:54.420 --> 2:18:59.420
 and you know what type of person they are, because there's a very unique person that does that job and usually can spot them.

2:18:59.420 --> 2:19:06.420
 I guess it's the kind of respect you have for the craftsmanship of the job that's taken on.

2:19:06.420 --> 2:19:13.420
 Certainly. And that person didn't come out in his $100 million jet because I pissed him off, you know? It's not an emotional response.

2:19:13.420 --> 2:19:22.420
 We're both there maybe because we chose to be in some sense, but at the best of someone else and outside of our control and power.

2:19:22.420 --> 2:19:35.420
 And so in a sense for me, it's almost a challenge that we've engaged upon agreeably, but that's such a romantic version that I have the luxury to have being high in my castle and the jet up there, not on the ground.

2:19:35.420 --> 2:19:42.420
 So I understand that it's a bit more romantic than perhaps, you know, someone on the ground experiencing all the horrors down there.

2:19:42.420 --> 2:19:46.420
 Because everything looks very small from above.

2:19:46.420 --> 2:19:55.420
 And that's another aspect of war with greater autonomy when you're controlling the mission versus, you know,

2:19:55.420 --> 2:20:14.420
 have a Jengis Khan type of intimacy in terms of the actual experience of war where you directly have you murder with a sword versus a gun versus a remotely controlled drone versus a strategic mission assignment to an autonomous drone that executes.

2:20:14.420 --> 2:20:18.420
 Abstracted away until it's just a small decision.

2:20:18.420 --> 2:20:30.420
 And my worry is the people without a voice are completely forgotten and silenced in all these calculations.

2:20:30.420 --> 2:20:35.420
 I spoke to a lot of people, poor people.

2:20:35.420 --> 2:20:42.420
 They feel like they've never really had a voice and they're too easily forgotten even within the country of Ukraine.

2:20:42.420 --> 2:21:01.420
 It's the big city versus the rural divide, you know, it's easy to forget the people that don't have a Twitter account and don't that their basic existence is just trying to survive, trying to put food on the table and they don't have anything else.

2:21:01.420 --> 2:21:14.420
 And they are the ones that truly feel the pain of war of the supply chain going down or the food supplies going down of a cold winter without power.

2:21:14.420 --> 2:21:18.420
 You're still young, but you've seen some things.

2:21:18.420 --> 2:21:26.420
 So let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat and give advice to young people.

2:21:26.420 --> 2:21:37.420
 Whether they're fascinated by technology or fascinated by fighter jets, whether they're fascinated by sort of engineering or the way the stars look at night.

2:21:37.420 --> 2:21:44.420
 What advice would you give them how to have a career that can be proud of or how to have a life that can be proud of?

2:21:44.420 --> 2:21:49.420
 I'd suggest that they don't fear looking foolish.

2:21:49.420 --> 2:22:01.420
 I spent a large portion of my life considering the laughter or the comments at my statements as indication that I shouldn't pursue that.

2:22:01.420 --> 2:22:12.420
 And so, you know, I kind of woke up to that fact a bit later, but I would encourage, you know, I would advise that people, you know, trust in themselves and trust in the things that they care about.

2:22:12.420 --> 2:22:15.420
 It doesn't matter if they're good at it.

2:22:15.420 --> 2:22:24.420
 All that matters is that they find something that they can apply love and care to and they will grow better at it and then most likely make the world better because of it.

2:22:24.420 --> 2:22:27.420
 And don't be afraid to look stupid.

2:22:27.420 --> 2:22:29.420
 Don't be afraid to look stupid.

2:22:29.420 --> 2:22:38.420
 Yeah, that's one of the things that I think as you get older, you're expected to be, to have it all figured out and so you are afraid to take on new things.

2:22:38.420 --> 2:22:46.420
 But I think as long as you're always looking stupid and having a beginner's mind, you can get really, really far even later on in life.

2:22:46.420 --> 2:22:48.420
 So this isn't just advice for young people.

2:22:48.420 --> 2:22:54.420
 This is really advice for everybody.

2:22:54.420 --> 2:23:05.420
 Maybe a dark question, but has there been a difficult time in your life, a really dark place you've gone in your mind that stands out?

2:23:05.420 --> 2:23:08.420
 They had to really overcome.

2:23:08.420 --> 2:23:13.420
 I would suggest that I've been pretty firm ground for most of my life.

2:23:13.420 --> 2:23:22.420
 I haven't had too many personal tragedies, I'll say, that have really defined me.

2:23:22.420 --> 2:23:25.420
 Certainly none that I would think are outside the norm.

2:23:25.420 --> 2:23:28.420
 So there is no truly low point?

2:23:28.420 --> 2:23:38.420
 Actually, I have one, and it's tough for me because I've spent most of my life beating emotions and high emotional responses out of my system, right?

2:23:38.420 --> 2:23:40.420
 Because that's what flying is, right?

2:23:40.420 --> 2:23:43.420
 It's keeping a steady line and doing what you need to do.

2:23:43.420 --> 2:23:50.420
 In fact, there's been studies that shown reduced adrenaline production in fighter pilots for a number of years after they get out.

2:23:50.420 --> 2:23:53.420
 But getting out of the Navy was difficult for me.

2:23:53.420 --> 2:24:00.420
 I wasn't expecting it to be a lot of bravado and machoism, of course, in the military, especially in the fighter community.

2:24:00.420 --> 2:24:08.420
 We all have our plans made up to get out, and none of it really accounts for any type of mental health or anything like that.

2:24:08.420 --> 2:24:11.420
 It's all very much, where am I going to get my paycheck from?

2:24:11.420 --> 2:24:13.420
 Where am I going to move to?

2:24:13.420 --> 2:24:18.420
 Whether it's the Navy or just individuals, truly understanding the difference that makes.

2:24:18.420 --> 2:24:26.420
 When I got out, it was difficult for me. I think a lot of guys in that job, when they get out, they almost, at least I had anxiety when I got out.

2:24:26.420 --> 2:24:36.420
 Because I was so used to being highly involved in something that was always involved with that when I got out.

2:24:36.420 --> 2:24:39.420
 I didn't know how to fill that space, essentially.

2:24:39.420 --> 2:24:46.420
 And while I wouldn't say it was an overly traumatic experience, I think it's one that's not accounted for enough that people that are getting out.

2:24:46.420 --> 2:24:53.420
 So I would encourage them to take it serious and actually think about it and respect the change, because it is a big one.

2:24:53.420 --> 2:24:59.420
 Well, if I may say you found a place in nature currently, a home.

2:24:59.420 --> 2:25:04.420
 Is there, can you speak to that being a source of happiness for you?

2:25:04.420 --> 2:25:05.420
 Absolutely.

2:25:05.420 --> 2:25:06.420
 An escape from the world?

2:25:06.420 --> 2:25:08.420
 Certainly, very much is.

2:25:08.420 --> 2:25:11.420
 Was it deliberate that you found it there?

2:25:11.420 --> 2:25:23.420
 That's home for me, so I moved back up to the Boston area, and my wife and I had an idea after moving about eight or nine times in the Navy of kind of what we wanted just generally.

2:25:23.420 --> 2:25:26.420
 And it was all really about the land and not about the house.

2:25:26.420 --> 2:25:29.420
 We just wanted privacy and to be nearby.

2:25:29.420 --> 2:25:32.420
 And so we ended up finding a lot of land, a parcel of land.

2:25:32.420 --> 2:25:39.420
 We put a house on it, and it provides me with a sense of peace that I think I can only get when I'm in nature.

2:25:39.420 --> 2:25:46.420
 A sense of clarity that helps me think, helps me relax, maybe so relaxing that helps me think, I don't know.

2:25:46.420 --> 2:25:58.420
 But being surrounded by nature and birds and animals for me has always allowed me to, I don't know, feel most in touch with my own thoughts in a sense.

2:25:58.420 --> 2:26:00.420
 It just provides clarity.

2:26:00.420 --> 2:26:13.420
 And so this little sanctuary you could say I've built allows me to, you know, interface via a fiber line at my house, but also feel like I'm a million miles away sometimes, which is the best of both worlds.

2:26:13.420 --> 2:26:15.420
 Hey, you can just walk outside to escape at all.

2:26:15.420 --> 2:26:16.420
 Yes.

2:26:16.420 --> 2:26:22.420
 To experience life as hundreds of generations of human species have experienced it.

2:26:22.420 --> 2:26:24.420
 Maybe it's the dichotomy.

2:26:24.420 --> 2:26:31.420
 My desire for the fastness of technology and experience compared with the most basic baseline that we have.

2:26:31.420 --> 2:26:32.420
 Isn't that strange?

2:26:32.420 --> 2:26:34.420
 How do you, how do you square that?

2:26:34.420 --> 2:26:35.420
 I don't know.

2:26:35.420 --> 2:26:41.420
 Your draw, how drawn you are to the cutting edge and still the calm you find in nature.

2:26:41.420 --> 2:26:42.420
 I think it makes sense.

2:26:42.420 --> 2:26:45.420
 Nature is vastly superior to almost all of our technology.

2:26:45.420 --> 2:26:46.420
 From a technology perspective?

2:26:46.420 --> 2:26:47.420
 Yeah, it is.

2:26:47.420 --> 2:26:52.420
 And so a way it's being surrounded by perfection in a lot of senses.

2:26:52.420 --> 2:26:56.420
 In the military and in general, have you contemplated your mortality?

2:26:56.420 --> 2:26:58.420
 Have you been afraid of death?

2:26:58.420 --> 2:27:02.420
 What was, what's your relationship like with death?

2:27:02.420 --> 2:27:08.420
 I was willing to accept an oversized amount of risk, I'll say when I was younger as an aviator.

2:27:08.420 --> 2:27:10.420
 Not in the jet, but just that was my life.

2:27:10.420 --> 2:27:21.420
 You know, I felt like I was going to live forever and going out into war, you know, strangely didn't really change that because, you know, as an aviator, again, we're riding up high on our horse up there.

2:27:21.420 --> 2:27:39.420
 So there were times when I was in situations that could have resulted in death from flying or from emergency in the aircraft, but I'll be honest, I never really kind of sat down to think about the mortality of it afterwards.

2:27:39.420 --> 2:27:44.420
 I feel like I kind of signed a check at the beginning and it was my job to perform as well as I could.

2:27:44.420 --> 2:27:50.420
 And if something happened in that, then I better damn well be sure I would do my best at the time then.

2:27:50.420 --> 2:28:04.420
 So, you know, I maybe didn't personally reflect on it as much as I, one would think, you know, because once you get in that machine, it doesn't give you a lot of time to sit back and philosophize on your current situation.

2:28:04.420 --> 2:28:10.420
 And the same, just like we weren't seeing these, or when we see these objects off the coast, we weren't necessarily, you know, examining them every day, right?

2:28:10.420 --> 2:28:14.420
 We'd put them into that bucket because it wasn't something that was going to kill us right away.

2:28:14.420 --> 2:28:20.420
 And thinking about death when you're so close to it all the time would be debilitating.

2:28:20.420 --> 2:28:22.420
 It would probably make you worse at your job.

2:28:22.420 --> 2:28:24.420
 It would.

2:28:24.420 --> 2:28:34.420
 Well, maybe you can think about death when you look out when you go out into nature and think like the fact that this whole ride ends, it's such a weird thing.

2:28:34.420 --> 2:28:37.420
 And the old makes way to new.

2:28:37.420 --> 2:28:50.420
 And that's all throughout nature. And if you just look at the cruelty of nature or the beauty of nature, however you think about it, the fact that the big thing eats the little thing over and over.

2:28:50.420 --> 2:28:55.420
 And that's just how it progresses. And that's how adaptation happens.

2:28:55.420 --> 2:29:08.420
 Death is a requirement for evolution. And, you know, whether evolution allows us to see objective reality or not, it still gives you some interesting thoughts about perspectives of death.

2:29:08.420 --> 2:29:13.420
 And especially concerning its biological necessity as far as evolution is concerned.

2:29:13.420 --> 2:29:25.420
 Yeah, it's weird. It's weird that there's been like a hundred billion people that lived before us and that you and I will be forgotten. This whole thing we're doing now is meaningless in that sense.

2:29:25.420 --> 2:29:30.420
 But at the same time, it feels deeply meaningful somehow.

2:29:30.420 --> 2:29:36.420
 I guess that that's the question I want to ask when you go out to nature with family.

2:29:36.420 --> 2:29:42.420
 What do you think is the meaning of it all? What's the meaning of life?

2:29:42.420 --> 2:29:50.420
 Or maybe when you put on the night goggles, the night vision goggles and look up at the stars. Why are we here?

2:29:50.420 --> 2:29:58.420
 I can't speak for everyone, but at least the way I interpret it, you know, or at least I feel like I interpret my way here.

2:29:58.420 --> 2:30:06.420
 My job is, I feel like my role is just to be curious about the environment in a manner that allows us to understand as much as possible.

2:30:06.420 --> 2:30:16.420
 I think that the human mind, whether it's just the mass inside our skull or whether there's some type of quantum interactions going on,

2:30:16.420 --> 2:30:26.420
 our mind has incredible ability to output new information in a universe that is somewhat stale of information, right?

2:30:26.420 --> 2:30:36.420
 Our minds are somewhat unique in that we can imagine and perceive things that could never ever have possibly naturally occurred, and yet we can make it happen.

2:30:36.420 --> 2:30:40.420
 We can instantiate that with enough belief that it's true and it can happen.

2:30:40.420 --> 2:30:52.420
 And so for me, I feel like I just need to encourage that, to encourage interaction with reality such that it leads us to newer and grander interactions with this universe.

2:30:52.420 --> 2:30:56.420
 And all that starts with a little bit of curiosity.

2:30:56.420 --> 2:31:03.420
 Right, you're an incredible person. You've done so many things and there's so much still ahead of you.

2:31:03.420 --> 2:31:12.420
 Thank you for being brave enough to talk about UFOs and doing it so seriously, and thank you for pushing forward on all these fronts in terms of technology.

2:31:12.420 --> 2:31:22.420
 So from just to fight or just the engineering of that to the AIML applications in the combat setting, that's super interesting.

2:31:22.420 --> 2:31:28.420
 And then now, quantum, I can't wait to see what you do next. Thank you so much for sitting down and talking today. It was an honor.

2:31:28.420 --> 2:31:30.420
 It was my pleasure. Thank you, Lex.

2:31:30.420 --> 2:31:34.420
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lieutenant Ryan Graves.

2:31:34.420 --> 2:31:38.420
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:31:38.420 --> 2:31:42.420
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Buzz Aldrin.

2:31:42.420 --> 2:31:47.420
 Bravery comes along as a gradual accumulation of discipline.

2:31:47.420 --> 2:32:09.420
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
