WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
 The following is a conversation with Anne Drewian, writer, producer, director, and one

00:06.080 --> 00:10.480
 of the most important and impactful communicators of science in our time.

00:10.480 --> 00:17.720
 She cowrote the 1980 science documentary series Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she married

00:17.720 --> 00:24.880
 in 1981 and her love for whom, with the help of NASA, was recorded as brainwaves on a golden

00:24.880 --> 00:30.800
 record along with other things our civilization has to offer and launched into space on the Voyager

00:30.800 --> 00:38.400
 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now, 42 years later, still active, reaching out farther

00:38.400 --> 00:42.960
 into deep space than any human made object ever has.

00:42.960 --> 00:48.800
 This was a profound and beautiful decision and made as a creative director of NASA's

00:48.800 --> 00:51.440
 Voyager Interstellar Message Project.

00:51.440 --> 00:57.360
 In 2014, she went on to create the second season of Cosmos, called Cosmos a Spacetime

00:57.360 --> 01:04.600
 Odyssey, and in 2020, the new third season called Cosmos Possible Worlds, which is being

01:04.600 --> 01:07.600
 released this upcoming Monday, March 9th.

01:07.600 --> 01:14.920
 It is hosted, once again, by the fun and the brilliant Neil deGrasse Tyson.

01:14.920 --> 01:20.640
 Carl Sagan, Anne Drewian, and Cosmos have inspired millions of scientists and curious

01:20.640 --> 01:27.800
 minds across several generations by revealing the magic, the power, the beauty of science.

01:27.800 --> 01:33.920
 I am one such curious mind, and if you listen to this podcast, you may know that Elon Musk

01:33.920 --> 01:34.920
 is as well.

01:34.920 --> 01:40.400
 He graciously agreed to read Carl Sagan's words about the pale blue dot in my second

01:40.400 --> 01:42.280
 conversation with him.

01:42.280 --> 01:48.280
 If you listened, there was an interesting and inspiring twist at the end.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.720
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:50.720 --> 01:56.280
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it 5,000 Apple Podcasts, support it on Patreon,

01:56.280 --> 02:02.360
 or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

02:02.360 --> 02:07.000
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can

02:07.000 --> 02:08.960
 break the flow of the conversation.

02:08.960 --> 02:13.800
 I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.960
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:17.960 --> 02:21.400
 When you get it, use code LEX Podcast.

02:21.400 --> 02:26.040
 Cash App lets you send money to friends by Bitcoin and invest in the stock market with

02:26.040 --> 02:28.920
 as little as $1.

02:28.920 --> 02:34.240
 Since Cash App allows you to send and receive money digitally, peer to peer, and security

02:34.240 --> 02:39.600
 in all digital transactions is very important, let me mention the PCI data security standard

02:39.600 --> 02:41.560
 that Cash App is compliant with.

02:41.560 --> 02:45.120
 I'm a big fan of standards for safety and security.

02:45.120 --> 02:50.760
 PCI DSS is a good example of that, where a bunch of competitors got together and agreed

02:50.760 --> 02:55.480
 that there needs to be a global standard around the security of transactions.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.840
 Now we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence systems

02:59.840 --> 03:01.840
 in general.

03:01.840 --> 03:07.680
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play, and use the code LEX Podcast,

03:07.680 --> 03:13.440
 you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to first, one of my favorite organizations

03:13.440 --> 03:19.280
 that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.

03:19.280 --> 03:24.480
 And now here's my conversation with Anne Drewian.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.920
 What is the role of science in our society?

03:26.920 --> 03:35.800
 Well, I think of what Einstein said when he opened the 1939 New York World's Fair.

03:35.800 --> 03:46.960
 He said, if science is ever to fulfill its mission the way art has done, it must penetrate.

03:46.960 --> 03:53.440
 Its inner meaning must penetrate the consciousness of everyone.

03:53.440 --> 04:00.640
 And so for me, especially in a civilization dependent on high technology and science,

04:00.640 --> 04:04.880
 one that aspires to be democratic.

04:04.880 --> 04:13.520
 It's critical that the public, as informed decision makers, understand the values and

04:13.520 --> 04:17.640
 the methods and the rules of science.

04:17.640 --> 04:24.320
 So you think about what you just mentioned, the values and the methods and the rules and

04:24.320 --> 04:30.440
 maybe the technology that science produces, but what about sort of the beauty, the mystery

04:30.440 --> 04:31.440
 of science?

04:31.440 --> 04:37.320
 Well, you've touched on what I think is, for me, that's how my way into science is that

04:37.320 --> 04:44.840
 for me, it's much more spiritually uplifting, the revelations of science, the collective

04:44.840 --> 04:51.880
 revelations of really countless generations of searchers.

04:51.880 --> 05:00.160
 And the little tiny bit we know about reality is the greatest joy for me because I think

05:00.160 --> 05:06.000
 it relates to the idea of love, like, what is love that is based on illusion about the

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
 other?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.240
 That's not love.

05:09.240 --> 05:16.200
 Love is seeing, unflinching the other and accepting with all your heart.

05:16.200 --> 05:21.400
 And to me, knowing the universe as it is or the little bit that we're able to understand

05:21.400 --> 05:25.360
 at this point is the purest kind of love.

05:25.360 --> 05:32.800
 And therefore, how can our philosophy, our religion, if it's rootless in nature, how

05:32.800 --> 05:35.520
 can it really be true?

05:35.520 --> 05:36.800
 I just don't understand.

05:36.800 --> 05:47.000
 So I think you need science to get a sense of the real romance of life and the great

05:47.000 --> 05:50.800
 experience of being awake in the cosmos.

05:50.800 --> 05:58.960
 So the fact that we know so little, the humbling nature of that, and you kind of connect love

05:58.960 --> 06:04.560
 to that, but isn't it scary?

06:04.560 --> 06:06.880
 Why is it so inspiring, do you think?

06:06.880 --> 06:10.360
 Why is it so beautiful that we know so little?

06:10.360 --> 06:16.960
 Well, first of all, as Socrates thought, knowing that you know little is knowing, really knowing

06:16.960 --> 06:19.760
 something, knowing more than others.

06:19.760 --> 06:27.960
 And it's that voice whispering in our heads, so you might be wrong, which I think is not

06:27.960 --> 06:32.880
 only it's really healthy because we're so imperfect, we're human, of course.

06:32.880 --> 06:38.960
 But also, love to me is the feeling that you always want to go deeper, get closer.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.520
 You can't get enough of it.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.640
 You can't get close enough, deep enough.

06:45.640 --> 06:50.200
 And that's what science is always saying, and science is never simply content with its

06:50.200 --> 06:53.640
 understanding of any aspect of nature.

06:53.640 --> 06:59.720
 It's always saying, it's always finding that even smaller cosmos beneath.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.960
 So I think the two are very much parallel.

07:03.960 --> 07:08.480
 So you said that love is not an illusion.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.480
 No, it's not.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.480
 Well, it is.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.120
 So what is love?

07:12.120 --> 07:24.600
 What is love is knowing, for me, love is knowing something deeply and still being completely

07:24.600 --> 07:28.400
 gratified by it and wanting to know more.

07:28.400 --> 07:40.720
 So what is loving someone, a person, let's say, deeply, is not idealizing them, not putting

07:40.720 --> 07:48.840
 some kind of subjective projection on them, but knowing them as they are.

07:48.840 --> 07:55.480
 And so for me, the only aperture to that, knowing about nature, the universe, is science

07:55.480 --> 08:01.040
 because it has that error correcting mechanism that most of the stuff that we do doesn't

08:01.040 --> 08:02.040
 have.

08:02.040 --> 08:06.560
 You could say the Bill of Rights is kind of an error correcting mechanism, which is one

08:06.560 --> 08:12.320
 of the things I really appreciate about the society in which I live, to the extent that

08:12.320 --> 08:16.160
 it's upheld and we keep faith with it.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.160
 And the same with science.

08:17.160 --> 08:25.040
 It's like, we will give you the highest rewards we have for proving us wrong about something.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.720
 That's genius.

08:27.720 --> 08:37.600
 That's why in only 400 years since Galileo's first look through a telescope, we could get

08:37.600 --> 08:48.480
 from this really dim, vague apprehension of another world to sending our eyes and our

08:48.480 --> 08:52.440
 senses there or even going beyond.

08:52.440 --> 08:58.680
 So it delivers the goods like nothing else.

08:58.680 --> 09:06.400
 It really delivers the goods because it's always self aware of its fallibility.

09:06.400 --> 09:12.200
 So on that topic, I'd like to ask just your opinion and the feeling I have that I'm not

09:12.200 --> 09:18.200
 sure what to do with, which is the skeptical aspect of science.

09:18.200 --> 09:24.240
 So the modern skeptics community and just in general, certain scientists, many scientists,

09:24.240 --> 09:30.800
 maybe most scientists that apply this scientific method are kind of rigorous in that application.

09:30.800 --> 09:36.000
 And it feels like sometimes miss out some of the ideas outside the reach of, just slightly

09:36.000 --> 09:37.800
 outside the reach of science.

09:37.800 --> 09:43.160
 And they don't dare to sort of dream or think of revolutionary ideas that others will call

09:43.160 --> 09:45.160
 crazy in this particular moment.

09:45.160 --> 09:50.600
 So how do you think about the skeptical aspect of science that is really good at sort of

09:50.600 --> 09:56.120
 keeping us in check, keeping us humble, but at the same time, sort of the kind of dreams

09:56.120 --> 10:01.280
 that you and Carl Sagan have inspired in the world, it kind of shuts it down sometimes

10:01.280 --> 10:02.280
 a little bit.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.280
 Yeah.

10:03.280 --> 10:09.080
 I mean, I think it's up to the individual, but for me, I was so ridiculously fortunate

10:09.080 --> 10:14.240
 in that my tutorial in science, because I'm not a scientist and it wasn't trained in

10:14.240 --> 10:20.480
 science was 20 years of days and nights with Carl Sagan.

10:20.480 --> 10:26.480
 And the wonder, I think the reason Carl remains so beloved, well, I think there are many reasons,

10:26.480 --> 10:33.320
 but at the root of it is the fact that his skepticism was never at the cost of his wonder

10:33.320 --> 10:38.280
 and his wonder was never at the cost of his skepticism.

10:38.280 --> 10:42.640
 So he couldn't fool himself into believing something he wanted to believe because it

10:42.640 --> 10:45.440
 made him feel good.

10:45.440 --> 10:52.640
 But on the other hand, he recognized that what science, what nature is, it's really,

10:52.640 --> 10:57.640
 it's good enough, it's way better than our fantasies.

10:57.640 --> 11:05.000
 And so if you're that kind of person who loves happiness, loves life and your eyes are wide

11:05.000 --> 11:10.520
 open and you read everything you can get your hands on and you spend years studying what

11:10.520 --> 11:19.840
 is known so far about the universe, then you have that capacity, a really infinite capacity

11:19.840 --> 11:28.040
 to be alive, but also at the same time to be very rigorous about what you're willing

11:28.040 --> 11:29.040
 to believe.

11:29.040 --> 11:36.040
 For Carl, I don't think he ever felt that his skepticism cost him anything, because

11:36.040 --> 11:37.720
 again, it comes back to love.

11:37.720 --> 11:44.880
 He wanted to know what Nietzsche really was like, not to inflict his preconceived notions

11:44.880 --> 11:46.600
 on what he wanted it to be.

11:46.600 --> 11:54.360
 So you can't go wrong because it doesn't, I mean, I think the pale blue dot is a perfect

11:54.360 --> 12:04.560
 example of his massive achievement is to say, okay, or the Voyager record is another example.

12:04.560 --> 12:09.160
 Here we have this mission, our first reconnaissance of the outer solar system.

12:09.160 --> 12:19.360
 Well, how can we make it a mission in which we absolutely squeeze every drop of consciousness

12:19.360 --> 12:21.920
 and understanding from it?

12:21.920 --> 12:25.920
 We don't have to be scientists and then be human beings.

12:25.920 --> 12:33.480
 I think that's the tragedy of Western civilization is that it's, you know, it's one of its greatest

12:33.480 --> 12:43.240
 gifts has been science and yet at the same time, it believing that we are the children

12:43.240 --> 12:50.760
 of a disappointed father, a tyrant who puts us in a maximum security prison and calls

12:50.760 --> 12:57.400
 it paradise, who looks at us, who watches us every moment and hates us for being our

12:57.400 --> 13:03.040
 human selves, you know, and then most of all, what is our great sin?

13:03.040 --> 13:10.040
 It's partaking of the tree of knowledge, which is our greatest gift as humans, this pattern

13:10.040 --> 13:18.520
 recognition, this ability to see things and then synthesize them and jump to conclusions

13:18.520 --> 13:21.360
 about them and test those conclusions.

13:21.360 --> 13:31.560
 So I think the reason that in literature, in movies, the scientist is a figure of alienation,

13:31.560 --> 13:37.680
 a figure, you know, or you see these biopics about scientists and yeah, he might have been

13:37.680 --> 13:44.560
 great, but, you know, he was missing a chip, you know, he was a lousy husband.

13:44.560 --> 13:52.200
 He lacked, you know, the kind of spiritual understanding that maybe, you know, his wife

13:52.200 --> 13:55.920
 had and it's always in the end they come around.

13:55.920 --> 14:02.480
 But to me, that's a false dichotomy, that we are, you know, to the extent that we are

14:02.480 --> 14:07.400
 aware of our surroundings and understand them, which is what science makes it possible for

14:07.400 --> 14:11.120
 us to do, we're even more alive.

14:11.120 --> 14:16.160
 So you mentioned a million awesome things there, let's even just, can you tell me about

14:16.160 --> 14:23.560
 the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft and the interstellar message project and that whole just fascinating

14:23.560 --> 14:24.800
 world leading up to this.

14:24.800 --> 14:29.440
 One of my favorite subjects, I love talking about it, I'll never get over it, I'll never

14:29.440 --> 14:35.280
 be able to really wrap my head around the reality of it, the truth of it.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.480
 What is it for so, what's the Voyager spacecraft?

14:37.480 --> 14:45.280
 Okay, so Voyagers 1 and 2 were our first reconnaissance mission of what was then considered the outer

14:45.280 --> 14:47.400
 solar system.

14:47.400 --> 14:55.840
 And it was a gift of gravity, the idea that swinging around these worlds gives you a gravitational

14:55.840 --> 15:02.760
 assist which ultimately will send you out of the solar system to wander the Milky Way

15:02.760 --> 15:08.000
 galaxy for one to five billion years.

15:08.000 --> 15:20.480
 So Voyager gave us our first close up look of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, it discovered

15:20.480 --> 15:31.360
 new moons, it discovered volcanoes on Io, its achievements are astonishing.

15:31.360 --> 15:37.240
 And remember, this is technology from the early to mid 1970s.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.240
 And it's still active.

15:38.240 --> 15:42.360
 And it's still active, we talked to Voyager a few days ago.

15:42.360 --> 15:49.480
 We talked to it, in fact, a year ago, I think it was, we needed to slightly change the attitude

15:49.480 --> 15:50.760
 of the spacecraft.

15:50.760 --> 15:56.480
 And so we fired up its thrusters for the first time since 1987.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.480
 Do they work?

15:57.480 --> 15:58.480
 Instantly.

15:58.480 --> 16:05.560
 It was as if you had left your car in the garage in 1987 and you put the key in the ignition

16:05.560 --> 16:08.560
 because you used keys then in the ignition.

16:08.560 --> 16:12.400
 And it turned over the first time you stepped on the gas.

16:12.400 --> 16:17.320
 And so that's the genius of the engineering of Voyager.

16:17.320 --> 16:26.160
 And Carl was one of the key participants in imagining what its mission would be because

16:26.160 --> 16:35.160
 it was a gift, actually, of the fact that every 175 years plus or minus, there is an

16:35.160 --> 16:37.040
 alignment of the worlds.

16:37.040 --> 16:44.960
 And so you can send two spacecraft to these other worlds and photograph them and use your

16:44.960 --> 16:54.120
 mass spectrometer and all the other devices on Voyager to really explore these worlds.

16:54.120 --> 17:00.520
 And it's the farthest spacecraft, it's the farthest human creation away from us today.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.760
 Yes, Voyager 1.

17:01.760 --> 17:02.960
 Voyager 1.

17:02.960 --> 17:09.320
 These two spacecraft not only gave us our first close up look at hundreds of moons and

17:09.320 --> 17:17.760
 planets, these four giant planets, but also it told us the shape of the solar system as

17:17.760 --> 17:23.760
 it moves through the galaxy because there were two of them going in different directions.

17:23.760 --> 17:30.320
 And they arrived at a place called the Heliopause, which is where the wind from the sun, the solar

17:30.320 --> 17:35.120
 wind dies down and the interstellar medium begins.

17:35.120 --> 17:41.960
 And both Voyagers were the first spacecraft that we had that could tell us when that happened.

17:41.960 --> 17:50.160
 So it's a consummate, I think it's the greatest scientific achievement of the 20th century.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.440
 And engineering in some sense.

17:52.440 --> 18:01.800
 I mean, really, Voyager is doing this on less energy than you have in your toaster.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.160
 Something like 11 watts.

18:04.160 --> 18:10.280
 So okay, but because of this gravitational assist, both Voyagers were destined, as I

18:10.280 --> 18:13.880
 say, to, they were destined, they were, first of all, they were supposed to function for

18:13.880 --> 18:15.520
 a dozen years.

18:15.520 --> 18:20.960
 And now it's 42 years since launch and we're still talking to them.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.000
 So that's amazing.

18:23.000 --> 18:31.120
 But prior to launch, almost a year, eight, nine months prior to launch, it was decided

18:31.120 --> 18:36.920
 that since Frank Drake and Carl Sagan and Linda Salzman Sagan had created something called

18:36.920 --> 18:45.120
 the Pioneer 10 plaque for the Pioneer spacecraft that preceded Voyager, which was kind of like

18:45.120 --> 18:54.360
 a license plate for the planet Earth, a man and a woman, hands up, very basic, but very

18:54.360 --> 18:55.960
 effective.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.600
 And it captured the imagination of people all over the world.

18:59.600 --> 19:09.240
 And so NASA turned to Frank and to Carl and said, we'd like you to do a message for Voyager,

19:09.240 --> 19:16.600
 because if it's going to be circumnavigating the Milky Way Galaxy for one to five billion

19:16.600 --> 19:20.640
 years, you know, it's like 20 trips around the galaxy.

19:20.640 --> 19:28.120
 And there's a very small chance that a spacefaring civilization would be able to flag one of

19:28.120 --> 19:29.640
 them down.

19:29.640 --> 19:37.240
 And so on board you see this exquisite golden disk with scientific hieroglyphics explaining

19:37.240 --> 19:48.760
 our address and various basic scientific concepts that we believe that would be common to any

19:48.760 --> 19:51.440
 spacefaring civilization.

19:51.440 --> 20:00.640
 And then beneath this exquisite golden disk is the Voyager record, the golden record.

20:00.640 --> 20:14.640
 And it contains something like 118 photographs, images of life on Earth, as well as 27 pieces

20:14.640 --> 20:19.160
 of music from all around the world.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.560
 Many people describe it as the invention of world music.

20:22.560 --> 20:27.280
 World music was not a concept that existed before the Voyager record.

20:27.280 --> 20:33.080
 And we were determined to take our music, not just from the dominant technical cultures,

20:33.080 --> 20:39.400
 but from all of the rich cultural heritage of the Earth.

20:39.400 --> 20:48.000
 And there's a sound essay, which is kind of using a microphone as a camera to tell the

20:48.000 --> 20:58.160
 story of the Earth beginning with its geological sounds and moving into biology and then into

20:58.160 --> 21:00.400
 technology.

21:00.400 --> 21:08.120
 And like I think what you were getting at is that at the end of this sound essay, I

21:08.120 --> 21:14.640
 had asked Karl if it were in the making of the record, it was my honor to be the creative

21:14.640 --> 21:16.600
 director of the project.

21:16.600 --> 21:25.600
 If it was possible to, if I had meditated for an hour while I was hooked up so that

21:25.600 --> 21:35.320
 every single signal that was coming from my brain, my body, was recorded and then converted

21:35.320 --> 21:42.560
 into sound for the record, was it possible that these putative extraterrestrials of

21:42.560 --> 21:48.640
 the distant future of perhaps a billion years from now would be able to reconstitute this

21:48.640 --> 21:51.800
 message and to understand it?

21:51.800 --> 21:56.680
 And he just big smile, you know, and just say, well, hey, a billion years is a long time.

21:56.680 --> 21:57.680
 It's a long time.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.000
 Oh, do it.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.200
 And so I did this.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.480
 And what were you thinking about in the meditation?

22:03.480 --> 22:09.160
 Like what, I mean, it's such an interesting idea of recording as you think about things.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.760
 What were you thinking about?

22:10.760 --> 22:17.880
 So I was blindfolded and couldn't hear anything.

22:17.880 --> 22:23.360
 And I had made a mental itinerary of exactly where I wanted to go.

22:23.360 --> 22:33.880
 I was truly humbled by the idea that these thoughts could conceivably touch the distant

22:33.880 --> 22:34.880
 future.

22:34.880 --> 22:35.880
 Yeah, that's incredible.

22:35.880 --> 22:41.600
 In 1977, there are some 60,000 nuclear weapons on the planet.

22:41.600 --> 22:51.160
 The Soviet Union and the United States are engaged in a, you know, to the death competition.

22:51.160 --> 22:59.240
 And so I began by trying to tell the history of the planet in, you know, to my limited

22:59.240 --> 23:06.760
 ability, what I understood about the story of the early existence of the planet, about

23:06.760 --> 23:16.640
 the origin of life, about the evolution of life, about the history of humans, about our

23:16.640 --> 23:25.560
 current at that time predicament, about the fact that one in five of us was starving or

23:25.560 --> 23:29.360
 unable to get potable water.

23:29.360 --> 23:37.200
 And so I sort of gave a kind of, you know, as general a picture as I possibly could of

23:37.200 --> 23:39.560
 our predicament.

23:39.560 --> 23:50.920
 And I also was very newly within days of the moment when Karl and I fell in love with each

23:50.920 --> 23:51.920
 other.

23:51.920 --> 23:55.600
 We fell in love with each other long before because we'd known each other for years.

23:55.600 --> 24:00.040
 But it was the first time that we had expressed our feelings for each other.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.040
 Acknowledged it.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.040
 The existence of this.

24:02.040 --> 24:10.080
 Yes, because we're both involved with other people and it was completely outside his morality

24:10.080 --> 24:13.920
 in mind to even broach the subject.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.600
 But it was the only days after that it happened.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.760
 And for me, it was a eureka moment.

24:20.760 --> 24:28.800
 It was in the context of finding that piece of Chinese music that was worthy to represent

24:28.800 --> 24:34.480
 one of the oldest musical traditions on earth when those of us who worked on the Voyager

24:34.480 --> 24:38.120
 record were completely ignorant about Chinese music.

24:38.120 --> 24:42.520
 And so that had been a constant challenge for me.

24:42.520 --> 24:50.160
 Looking to professors of Chinese music as no music colleges everywhere and all through

24:50.160 --> 24:56.520
 the project desperately trying to find this one piece, found the piece, lived on the Upper

24:56.520 --> 25:04.600
 West Side, found the piece a professor at Columbia University gave it to me.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.960
 And he's of all the people I talked to, everyone had said, that's hopeless.

25:08.960 --> 25:09.960
 You can't do that.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.880
 There can't be one piece of Chinese music.

25:12.880 --> 25:17.720
 But he was completely, no problem, I've got it.

25:17.720 --> 25:24.800
 And so he told me the story of the piece, which only made it an even greater candidate

25:24.800 --> 25:27.280
 for the record.

25:27.280 --> 25:35.720
 And I listened to it called Carl Sagan, who was in Tucson, Arizona, addressing the American

25:35.720 --> 25:45.800
 Society of Newspaper Editors, and I left him a message, Hotel Message Center.

25:45.800 --> 25:55.760
 And he called me back an hour later, and I heard this beautiful voice say, I get back

25:55.760 --> 26:00.160
 to my hotel room, and I find this message that Annie called.

26:00.160 --> 26:05.440
 And I asked myself, why didn't you leave me this message 10 years ago?

26:05.440 --> 26:10.960
 My heart was beating out of my chest.

26:10.960 --> 26:21.560
 It was for me a kind of Eureka moment, a scientific breakthrough, a truth, a great truth suddenly

26:21.560 --> 26:24.080
 been revealed.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.760
 And of course, I was awkward and didn't really know what to say.

26:27.760 --> 26:32.040
 And so I blurted something out like, oh, I've been meaning to talk to you about that Carl,

26:32.040 --> 26:33.040
 which wasn't really true.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.480
 I never would have talked to him about it.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.400
 We had been alone countless times.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.360
 We humans are so awkward in these beautiful moments.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.880
 Yeah, in these amazing moments.

26:41.880 --> 26:45.480
 And I just said, for keeps.

26:45.480 --> 26:51.880
 And he thought for a very brief, like a second, and said, you mean get married?

26:51.880 --> 26:52.880
 And I said, yeah.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.440
 And he said, yeah.

26:55.440 --> 27:08.120
 And we put down the phone, and I literally was jumping around my apartment like a lunatic.

27:08.120 --> 27:12.880
 Because it was so obvious, you know, it was something like, of course.

27:12.880 --> 27:18.280
 And then the phone rang again, and I thought, damn, no, he's going to say, I don't know

27:18.280 --> 27:19.280
 what I was saying.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.280
 I am married.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.280
 I am a kid.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.560
 I'm not going to do this, you know?

27:23.560 --> 27:27.880
 But he was like, I just want to make sure that that really happened.

27:27.880 --> 27:28.880
 And I said, yeah.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.760
 And he said, we're getting married.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.960
 And I said, yeah, we're getting married.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.720
 Now this was June 1, 1977.

27:36.720 --> 27:42.200
 The records had not been affixed to the spacecraft yet.

27:42.200 --> 27:47.520
 And there had been a lot of controversy about what we were doing.

27:47.520 --> 27:56.160
 I should say that there, you know, among the 118 pictures was an image of a man and a woman

27:56.160 --> 28:00.080
 frontally, completely naked.

28:00.080 --> 28:07.840
 And there was, I believe, a congressman on the floor that said, NASA to send smut to

28:07.840 --> 28:09.800
 the stars, you know?

28:09.800 --> 28:14.600
 And so NASA really, they got very upset, and they said, you can't send a picture.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.400
 And we had done it so that it was so brilliant.

28:16.400 --> 28:23.280
 It was like this lovely couple, completely naked, and then the next image was a kind

28:23.280 --> 28:30.360
 of overlay schematic to show the fetus inside this woman that was developing.

28:30.360 --> 28:36.480
 And then that went off into, you know, additional imagery of human reproduction.

28:36.480 --> 28:44.640
 And it really hit me that how much we hate ourselves, that we couldn't bear to be seen

28:44.640 --> 28:46.640
 as we are.

28:46.640 --> 28:47.640
 So...

28:47.640 --> 28:53.200
 In some sense, that congressman also represents our society.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.120
 Perhaps his opposition should have been included as well.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.120
 Yes.

28:57.120 --> 29:02.280
 Well, that was one of the most vigorous debates during the making of the record with, you

29:02.280 --> 29:08.000
 know, the five or six people that we collaborated with was, do we show, do we only put our best

29:08.000 --> 29:17.640
 foot forward, or do we show Hiroshima, Auschwitz, the Congo, what we have done?

29:17.640 --> 29:20.800
 What do you think represents humanity?

29:20.800 --> 29:27.120
 If you kind of, if you think about it, are darker moments, are they essential for humanity?

29:27.120 --> 29:32.680
 All the wars we've been through, all the torches and the suffering and the cruelty, is that

29:32.680 --> 29:37.240
 essential for happiness, for beauty, for creation, generally speaking?

29:37.240 --> 29:40.560
 Well, it's certainly not essential for happiness or beauty, that's for sure.

29:40.560 --> 29:45.920
 I mean, it's part of who we are, if we're going to be real about it, which is, you know,

29:45.920 --> 29:51.640
 I think we tell on ourselves, even if we don't want to be real, we, you know, I think that

29:51.640 --> 29:58.320
 if you're a spacefaring civilization, and you've gotten it together sufficiently, that

29:58.320 --> 30:05.240
 you can move from world to world, then I think they probably took one look at this derelict

30:05.240 --> 30:11.720
 spacecraft, and they knew that these were people in their technological adolescence,

30:11.720 --> 30:18.600
 and they were just setting forth, and they must have had these issues, because it's,

30:18.600 --> 30:24.120
 and so it really, you know, that's the great thing about lying, is that a lie only has

30:24.120 --> 30:32.480
 a shelf life, like a great work of art that's a forgery, people can be fooled immediately,

30:32.480 --> 30:38.120
 but 10 or 15 years, 20 years later, they start to look at it, you know, they begin to realize

30:38.120 --> 30:45.520
 that the lens, our lens of our present is coloring everything that we see.

30:45.520 --> 30:52.520
 So, you know, I think it didn't matter that we didn't show our atrocities.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.200
 They would fill in the blanks.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.200
 They would fill in the blanks.

30:55.200 --> 31:02.480
 So, let me sort of ask, you've mentioned how unlikely it is that you and Carl did two souls

31:02.480 --> 31:06.360
 like yours would meet in this vast world.

31:06.360 --> 31:11.560
 What are your views on how and why incredibly unlikely things like these, nevertheless,

31:11.560 --> 31:12.560
 do happen?

31:12.560 --> 31:15.280
 It's purely to me a chance.

31:15.280 --> 31:17.960
 It's totally random.

31:17.960 --> 31:24.120
 It's a just, I mean, but, and the fact is, is that some people are, and it's happening

31:24.120 --> 31:26.160
 every day right now.

31:26.160 --> 31:33.120
 Some people are the random casualties of chance, and that, and I don't just mean the people

31:33.120 --> 31:41.240
 who are being, you know, destroyed in childhood, in wartime, I'm also, or the people who starved

31:41.240 --> 31:51.440
 to death because of famine, but also the people who, you know, who, who are not living to

31:51.440 --> 31:52.440
 the fullest.

31:52.440 --> 31:57.880
 And these things, I think there's a, my parents met on the subway in rush hour, and so I'm

31:57.880 --> 32:03.520
 only here with you because of the most random possible situation.

32:03.520 --> 32:08.440
 And so I've had this, a sense of this, even before I knew Carl, I always felt this way

32:08.440 --> 32:16.040
 that I only existed because of the generosity of the rush hour of the, of our, no, of just

32:16.040 --> 32:20.160
 all of the things, all of the skeins of causality.

32:20.160 --> 32:25.520
 Yeah, it's interesting because, you know, the rush hour is a source of stress for a

32:25.520 --> 32:32.520
 lot of people, but clearly in its moments, it can also be a source of something beautiful.

32:32.520 --> 32:33.520
 That's right.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.320
 Of strangers meeting and so on.

32:35.320 --> 32:42.960
 So everything, everything is, has a possibility of doing something beautiful.

32:42.960 --> 32:50.080
 So let me ask sort of a quick tangent on the Voyager, this, this beautiful romantic notion

32:50.080 --> 32:55.880
 that Voyager one is sort of our far, farthest human reach into space.

32:55.880 --> 33:01.160
 If you think of what, I don't know if you've seen, but Elon Musk did with the putting the

33:01.160 --> 33:07.280
 roadster, letting it fly out into space, there's a sort of humor to it.

33:07.280 --> 33:11.960
 I think that's also kind of interesting, but maybe you can comment on that.

33:11.960 --> 33:20.040
 But in general, if now that we are developing what we were venturing out into space again

33:20.040 --> 33:26.680
 in a more serious way, what kind of stuff that represent since Voyager was launched,

33:26.680 --> 33:28.960
 should we send out as a followup?

33:28.960 --> 33:35.120
 Is there things that you think that's developed in the next, in the 40 years after that we

33:35.120 --> 33:38.280
 should update the, the space varying aliens?

33:38.280 --> 33:41.800
 Well, of course now we could send the worldwide.

33:41.800 --> 33:45.480
 We could send everything that's on the worldwide web.

33:45.480 --> 33:50.320
 We could send, I mean, you know, that was a time when we were talking about photograph

33:50.320 --> 33:58.760
 records and transistor radios and, you know, so we tried to be, to take advantage of the

33:58.760 --> 34:03.960
 existing technology to the fullest extent, you know, the computer that was hooked up

34:03.960 --> 34:09.160
 to me from my brainwaves and my heart sounds while I was meditating was, you know, the size

34:09.160 --> 34:15.920
 of a gigantic room and I'm sure it's not, it didn't have the power of a phone has,

34:15.920 --> 34:17.440
 the phone has now.

34:17.440 --> 34:22.640
 So, you know, we could just, I think we could let it all hang out, we could just send, you

34:22.640 --> 34:29.080
 know, every, I mean, that's the wonder, like, I would send, you know, Wikipedia or something

34:29.080 --> 34:34.920
 and not be a gatekeeper, but show who we are.

34:34.920 --> 34:40.240
 We were also, it's interesting because one of the problems of the internet of having

34:40.240 --> 34:47.640
 so much information is it's actually the curation, the human curation is still the powerful,

34:47.640 --> 34:48.640
 beautiful thing.

34:48.640 --> 34:49.640
 Yes.

34:49.640 --> 34:54.760
 So what you did with the record is actually, is exactly the right process, it's kind of

34:54.760 --> 34:59.360
 boiling down a massive amount of possibilities of what you could send into something that

34:59.360 --> 35:05.200
 represents, you know, the better angels of our nature or represents our humanity.

35:05.200 --> 35:11.600
 So if you think about, you know, what would you send from the internet as opposed to sending

35:11.600 --> 35:14.960
 all of Wikipedia, for example, all of human knowledge?

35:14.960 --> 35:20.880
 Is there something just new that we've developed, do you think, or if fundamentally we're still

35:20.880 --> 35:23.680
 the same kind of human species?

35:23.680 --> 35:29.080
 I think fundamentally we're the same, but we have a kind of great, we are, we have

35:29.080 --> 35:37.680
 advanced to an astonishing degree in our capacity for data retrieval and for transmission.

35:37.680 --> 35:42.000
 And so, you know, I would send YouTube, I would send, you know, really, like think of

35:42.000 --> 35:52.960
 all the, you know, I still feel so lucky that there's any great musical artist of the last

35:52.960 --> 36:00.160
 hundred years who I revere, I can just find them and watch them and listen to them.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.040
 And you know, that's fantastic.

36:02.040 --> 36:09.920
 I also love how democratic it is that we each become curators and that we each decide those

36:09.920 --> 36:10.920
 things.

36:10.920 --> 36:17.440
 Now, I may not agree with, you know, those, the choices that everyone makes, but of course

36:17.440 --> 36:19.080
 not, because that's not the point.

36:19.080 --> 36:26.560
 The point is, is that we are, you know, we have discovered largely through the internet

36:26.560 --> 36:30.760
 that we are an intercommunicating organism.

36:30.760 --> 36:33.600
 And that can only be good.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.800
 So you could also send now Cosmos.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.960
 Yes, I'd love to.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.880
 I would be proud to.

36:41.880 --> 36:49.600
 I mean, you've spoken about a very specific voice that Cosmos had in that it reveals the

36:49.600 --> 36:50.600
 magical science.

36:50.600 --> 36:56.480
 I think you said shamanic journey of it and not the details of the latest breakthroughs

36:56.480 --> 36:57.480
 and so on.

36:57.480 --> 36:58.720
 It's just revealing the magic.

36:58.720 --> 37:06.200
 Can you try to describe what this voice of Cosmos is with the, with the follow up and

37:06.200 --> 37:08.840
 the new Cosmos that you're working on now?

37:08.840 --> 37:09.840
 Yes.

37:09.840 --> 37:19.320
 Well, the dream of Cosmos is really like Einstein's quote, you know, it's the idea of the awesome

37:19.320 --> 37:25.440
 power of science to be in absolutely everyone's hands.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.920
 You know, it belongs to all of us.

37:27.920 --> 37:31.840
 It's not the preserve of a priesthood.

37:31.840 --> 37:37.840
 It's just the community of science is becoming more diverse and being less exclusive than

37:37.840 --> 37:41.640
 it was guilty of in the not so recent past.

37:41.640 --> 37:50.600
 The discoveries of science, our understanding of the Cosmos that we live in has really grown

37:50.600 --> 37:58.920
 by leaps and bounds and probably would learn more in the last hundred years about it.

37:58.920 --> 38:04.400
 You know, the, the, the tempo of discovery has picked up so rapidly.

38:04.400 --> 38:12.800
 And so the idea of Cosmos from the 1970s when Carl and I and Steven Soder, another astronomer

38:12.800 --> 38:23.280
 first imagined it was that interweaving not only of the scientific concepts and revelations

38:23.280 --> 38:31.960
 and using, you know, cinematic VFX to take the viewer on this transporting, uplifting

38:31.960 --> 38:36.520
 journey, but also the stories of the searchers.

38:36.520 --> 38:44.600
 Because the more I have learned about, you know, the process of science through my life

38:44.600 --> 38:54.240
 with Carl and sense, the more I am really persuaded that it's that adherence to the

38:54.240 --> 39:02.320
 facts and to that adherence to that little approximation, that little bit of reality

39:02.320 --> 39:08.960
 that we've been able to get our hands around is something that we desperately need.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.400
 And it doesn't matter if you are a scientist.

39:11.400 --> 39:15.960
 In fact, the people, it matters even more if you're not.

39:15.960 --> 39:23.880
 And since, you know, the level of science teaching has been fairly or unfairly maligned.

39:23.880 --> 39:30.520
 And the idea that once there was such a thing as a television network, which of course has

39:30.520 --> 39:37.640
 now evolved into many other things, the idea that you could, in the most democratic way,

39:37.640 --> 39:44.000
 make accessible to absolutely everyone and most especially people who don't even realize

39:44.000 --> 39:50.840
 that they have an interest in a subject or who feel so intimidated by the jargon of science

39:50.840 --> 39:57.120
 and its kind of exclusive history, the idea that we could do this.

39:57.120 --> 40:04.440
 And you know, in season two of Cosmos, Space Time Odyssey, we were in 181 countries in

40:04.440 --> 40:06.480
 the space of two weeks.

40:06.480 --> 40:13.960
 It was the largest rollout in television history, which is really amazing for a, there is no

40:13.960 --> 40:15.520
 science based programming.

40:15.520 --> 40:21.320
 By the way, just to clarify, the series was rolled out, so it was shown in that many countries.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.240
 You said we were in the show.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.640
 Well, our show was in 180 countries.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.240
 Yeah, the show, which is incredible.

40:27.240 --> 40:31.640
 I mean, the hundreds of millions, whatever that number is, the people that watched it,

40:31.640 --> 40:33.520
 it's just, it's crazy.

40:33.520 --> 40:41.400
 It's so crazy that, for instance, my son had a cerebral hemorrhage a year ago.

40:41.400 --> 40:50.960
 And the doctor who saved his life in a very dangerous situation.

40:50.960 --> 40:59.600
 When he realized that, you know, that Sam and I were who we were, he said, that's why

40:59.600 --> 41:00.600
 I'm here.

41:00.600 --> 41:06.120
 You know, he said, if you come of age in a poor country like Colombia, and Carl Sagan

41:06.120 --> 41:13.480
 calls you to science when you're a child, then, you know, you go to medicine because

41:13.480 --> 41:15.680
 that's the only avenue open to you.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.840
 But that's why I'm here.

41:17.840 --> 41:24.400
 And I have heard that story, and I hear that story, I think every week.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.160
 How does that make you feel?

41:26.160 --> 41:31.520
 I mean, the number of scientists, I mean, a lot of it is quiet, right?

41:31.520 --> 41:36.360
 But the number of scientists Cosmos has created is just countless.

41:36.360 --> 41:40.560
 I mean, it probably touched the lives, I don't know, probably, it could be a crazy number

41:40.560 --> 41:43.800
 of the 90% of scientists or something that have been.

41:43.800 --> 41:50.280
 I would love to do that census because I, because that's the greatest gratification,

41:50.280 --> 41:52.280
 because that's the dream of science.

41:52.280 --> 41:58.480
 That's the whole idea is that if it belongs to all of us, and not just a tiny few, then

41:58.480 --> 42:03.240
 we have some chance of determining how it's used.

42:03.240 --> 42:11.320
 And if it's only in the hands of people whose only, whose only interests are the balance

42:11.320 --> 42:20.280
 sheet or hegemony over other nations or things like that, then it'll probably end up being

42:20.280 --> 42:22.880
 a gun aimed at our heads.

42:22.880 --> 42:30.640
 But if it's distributed in the widest possible way, a capability that we now have because

42:30.640 --> 42:38.160
 of our technology, then the chance is that it'll be used with wisdom.

42:38.160 --> 42:39.160
 That's the dream of it.

42:39.160 --> 42:42.960
 So that's why we did the first Cosmos.

42:42.960 --> 42:48.840
 We wanted to take not just, as I say, the scientific information, but also tell the

42:48.840 --> 42:58.000
 stories of these searchers, because for us and for me, carrying on this series in the

42:58.000 --> 43:07.360
 second and third seasons, the primary interest was that we wouldn't tell a story unless it

43:07.360 --> 43:09.280
 was kind of a threefer.

43:09.280 --> 43:17.560
 It was not just a way to understand a new scientific idea, but it was also a way to

43:17.560 --> 43:24.880
 understand what, if it matters what's true, how the world can change for us and how we

43:24.880 --> 43:27.400
 can be protected.

43:27.400 --> 43:33.200
 And if it doesn't matter what's true, then we're in grave danger because we have the

43:33.200 --> 43:41.280
 capability to not only destroy ourselves and our civilization, but to take so many species

43:41.280 --> 43:42.280
 with us.

43:42.280 --> 43:48.560
 And I'd like to talk to you about that particular sort of the dangers of ourselves in a little

43:48.560 --> 43:51.760
 bit, but sort of to linger on Cosmos.

43:51.760 --> 44:00.360
 Maybe for the first, the 1980 and the 2014 follow up, what's A or one of the or several

44:00.360 --> 44:07.560
 memorable moments from the creation of either of those seasons?

44:07.560 --> 44:16.160
 Well, the critical thing really was the fact that Seth MacFarlane became our champion because

44:16.160 --> 44:22.400
 I had been with three colleagues, I had been schlepping around from network to network

44:22.400 --> 44:29.560
 with a treatment for Cosmos and every network said they wanted to do it, but they wouldn't

44:29.560 --> 44:36.480
 give me creative control and they wouldn't give me enough money to make it cinematic

44:36.480 --> 44:40.680
 and to make it feel like you're really going on an adventure.

44:40.680 --> 44:45.200
 And I think both of those things, sorry to interrupt, both of those things are given

44:45.200 --> 44:52.040
 what Cosmos represents, the legacy of it and the legacy of Carl Sagan is essential, control,

44:52.040 --> 44:54.360
 especially in the modern world.

44:54.360 --> 44:58.040
 It's wonderful that you saw control that you did not really push it.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.040
 And I think they know.

44:59.040 --> 45:04.080
 And my partners, I'm sure, I know they would look at me like I was nuts, you know, and

45:04.080 --> 45:08.680
 they probably must have entertained the idea that maybe I didn't really want to do it,

45:08.680 --> 45:11.400
 you know, because I was afraid or something.

45:11.400 --> 45:15.840
 But I kept saying no, and it wasn't until I met Seth MacFarlane.

45:15.840 --> 45:24.200
 And he took me to Fox and Peter Rice and said, you know, I'll pay for half the pilot

45:24.200 --> 45:27.680
 if I have to, you know, and Peter Rice was like, put your money away.

45:27.680 --> 45:30.200
 And Seth said that, yeah.

45:30.200 --> 45:39.120
 And in every time since, in the 10 years since, at every turn, when we needed Seth to intervene

45:39.120 --> 45:43.600
 on our behalf, he stood up and he did it.

45:43.600 --> 45:51.120
 And so that was like, in a way, that is the, you know, the watershed for me of everything

45:51.120 --> 45:52.120
 that followed since.

45:52.120 --> 45:57.600
 And then I was so lucky because, you know, Steve and I, Steve Soder and I, written the

45:57.600 --> 46:04.080
 original Cosmos with Carl and collaborated on the treatment for season two.

46:04.080 --> 46:13.160
 And then Brad and Braga came into our project at the perfect moment and has proven to be

46:13.160 --> 46:17.160
 just a really, I have been so lucky my whole life.

46:17.160 --> 46:23.800
 I've collaborated, I've been lucky with the people, my collaborators have been extraordinary.

46:23.800 --> 46:26.220
 And so that was a critical thing.

46:26.220 --> 46:33.520
 But also to have, you know, for instance, our astonishing VFX supervisor who comes from

46:33.520 --> 46:39.720
 the movies, who heads the global association of VFX people, Jeff Oaken.

46:39.720 --> 46:44.760
 And, and then, and, and, you know, I can rattle off 10 more names.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.720
 I'd be happy to do that.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.760
 And it was that collaboration.

46:49.760 --> 46:52.560
 So the people were essential to the creation of?

46:52.560 --> 46:53.560
 Absolutely.

46:53.560 --> 46:58.280
 I mean, when it came down, I have to say that when it came down to the vision of what the

46:58.280 --> 47:04.120
 series would be, that with me sitting in my home, looking out the window and, you know,

47:04.120 --> 47:06.720
 really imagining like what I wanted to do.

47:06.720 --> 47:07.920
 Can you pause on that for a second?

47:07.920 --> 47:08.920
 Like, what's that process?

47:08.920 --> 47:13.280
 Because it, you know, Cosmos is also, it's grounded in science, of course, but it's also

47:13.280 --> 47:19.480
 incredibly imaginative and the words used are carefully crafted.

47:19.480 --> 47:20.480
 Thank you.

47:20.480 --> 47:28.000
 And it's, if you can talk about the process of that, the big picture imaginative thinking

47:28.000 --> 47:33.840
 and sort of the rigorous crafting of words that like basically turns into something

47:33.840 --> 47:35.340
 like poetry.

47:35.340 --> 47:37.560
 Thank you so much.

47:37.560 --> 47:48.320
 For me, these are rare occasions for human self esteem, the scientists that we bring

47:48.320 --> 47:57.960
 to life in Cosmos are people in my view who have everything we need to see us through this

47:57.960 --> 48:00.520
 current crisis.

48:00.520 --> 48:09.840
 It's there very often they come, they're poor, they're female, they're outsiders who are

48:09.840 --> 48:19.080
 not expected to have gifts that are so prodigious, but they persevere.

48:19.080 --> 48:25.680
 And so you have someone like Michael Faraday who is, comes from a family, dysfunctional

48:25.680 --> 48:33.240
 family of like 14 people and, you know, it never goes to university, never learns the

48:33.240 --> 48:34.240
 math.

48:34.240 --> 48:42.080
 But, you know, is the, you know, there's Einstein years later looking up at the picture of Faraday

48:42.080 --> 48:44.240
 to inspire him.

48:44.240 --> 48:54.080
 So it's, you know, if we had people with that kind of humility and unselfishness who didn't

48:54.080 --> 49:02.160
 want to patent everything as, you know, Michael Faraday created the wealth of the 20th century

49:02.160 --> 49:08.160
 with his various inventions, and yet he never took out a single patent at a time when people

49:08.160 --> 49:13.080
 were patenting everything because that was not what he was about.

49:13.080 --> 49:20.600
 And to me, that's a kind of almost a saintliness that says that, you know, here's a man who

49:20.600 --> 49:28.120
 finds in his life this tremendous gratification from searching.

49:28.120 --> 49:30.800
 And it's just so impressive to me.

49:30.800 --> 49:34.920
 And there are so many other people in Cosmos, especially the new season of Cosmos, which

49:34.920 --> 49:36.480
 is called Possible Worlds.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.480
 Possible.

49:37.480 --> 49:38.480
 Beautiful title.

49:38.480 --> 49:39.480
 Possible Worlds.

49:39.480 --> 49:49.080
 Well, I stole it from an author and a scientist from the 1940s, but it, for me, encapsulates

49:49.080 --> 49:55.680
 not just, you know, the exoplanets that we've begun to discover, not just, you know, the

49:55.680 --> 50:02.880
 worlds that we might visit, but also the world that this could be, a hopeful vision of the

50:02.880 --> 50:03.880
 future.

50:03.880 --> 50:08.560
 You asked me, what is common to all three seasons of Cosmos, or what is that voice?

50:08.560 --> 50:10.760
 It's a voice of hope.

50:10.760 --> 50:17.240
 It's a voice that says there is a future, which we bring to life in, I think, fairly

50:17.240 --> 50:23.880
 dazzling fashion that we can still have, you know, and in sitting down to imagine what

50:23.880 --> 50:29.040
 this season would be, the new season would be, sitting where I live in Ithaca, beautiful,

50:29.040 --> 50:37.200
 gorgeous place, trees, everywhere, waterfalls, I'm sitting there thinking, well, you know,

50:37.200 --> 50:41.600
 you can't, how do you, how do you awaken people?

50:41.600 --> 50:47.400
 I mean, you can't yell at them and say, we're all going to die, you know, it doesn't help.

50:47.400 --> 50:49.240
 It doesn't help.

50:49.240 --> 50:59.280
 But I think if you give them a vision of the future that's not pie in the sky, but something

50:59.280 --> 51:07.960
 ways in which science can be redemptive, can actually remediate our future, we have those

51:07.960 --> 51:16.240
 capabilities right now, as well as the capabilities to do things in the cosmos that we could be

51:16.240 --> 51:19.080
 doing right now, but we're not doing them.

51:19.080 --> 51:24.680
 Not because we don't know how to, how, you know, with the engineering or the material

51:24.680 --> 51:30.920
 sciences or the physics, we know all we need to know, but we're a little bit paralyzed

51:30.920 --> 51:33.120
 in some sense.

51:33.120 --> 51:39.120
 And you know, we're like, I always think we're like the toddler, you know, like we left

51:39.120 --> 51:43.600
 our mother's legs, you know, and scurried out to the moon.

51:43.600 --> 51:46.480
 And we had a moment of, wow, we can do this.

51:46.480 --> 51:51.960
 And then we realized, and somehow we had a failure of nerve and we went scurrying back

51:51.960 --> 51:56.800
 to our mother and, you know, did things that really weren't going to get us out there,

51:56.800 --> 52:02.440
 like the space shuttle, things like that, because it was a kind of failure of nerve.

52:02.440 --> 52:07.080
 So cosmos is about overcoming those fears.

52:07.080 --> 52:12.440
 We're now as a civilization ready to be a teenager venturing out into college, we're

52:12.440 --> 52:13.800
 turning back.

52:13.800 --> 52:14.800
 Exactly.

52:14.800 --> 52:15.800
 Exactly.

52:15.800 --> 52:25.640
 And that's one of my theories about our current situation, is that this is our adolescence.

52:25.640 --> 52:31.520
 And I was a total mess as an adolescent, I was reckless, irresponsible, totally.

52:31.520 --> 52:34.160
 I didn't, I was inconsiderate.

52:34.160 --> 52:41.520
 I, the reality of other people's feelings and the future didn't exist for me.

52:41.520 --> 52:46.800
 So why should a technologically adolescent civilization be any different?

52:46.800 --> 52:55.880
 But, you know, the vast majority of people I know made it through that period and went

52:55.880 --> 52:59.640
 on to be more wise.

52:59.640 --> 53:02.840
 And that's what my hope is for our civilization.

53:02.840 --> 53:10.680
 On a sort of darker and more difficult subject in terms of, you just talked about the cosmos

53:10.680 --> 53:18.840
 being an inspiration for science and for us growing out of our messy adolescence.

53:18.840 --> 53:22.160
 But nevertheless, there is threats in this world.

53:22.160 --> 53:27.560
 So do you worry about existential threats, like you mentioned nuclear weapons.

53:27.560 --> 53:30.480
 Do you worry about nuclear war?

53:30.480 --> 53:36.120
 And if you could also maybe comment, I don't know how much you've thought about it, but

53:36.120 --> 53:40.880
 there's folks like Elon Musk who are worried about the existential threats of artificial

53:40.880 --> 53:48.400
 intelligence, sort of our robotic computer creations, sort of resulting in us humans

53:48.400 --> 53:49.400
 losing control.

53:49.400 --> 53:53.800
 So can you speak to the things that worry you in terms of existential concerns?

53:53.800 --> 53:54.800
 Yeah, all of the above.

53:54.800 --> 54:00.600
 You don't have to be silly, you know, like not to think and not to look at, for instance,

54:00.600 --> 54:12.920
 our rapidly burgeoning capability in artificial intelligence, not end to see how sick so much

54:12.920 --> 54:17.240
 of the planet is not to be concerned.

54:17.240 --> 54:19.240
 Sick isn't evil, potentially.

54:19.240 --> 54:25.760
 Well, how much cruelty and brutality is happening at this very moment.

54:25.760 --> 54:32.640
 And I would put climate change higher up on that list because I believe that there are

54:32.640 --> 54:39.840
 unforeseen discoveries that we are making right now, for instance, all that methane that's

54:39.840 --> 54:49.560
 coming out of the ocean floor that was sequestered because of the permafrost, which is now melting.

54:49.560 --> 54:56.080
 You know, I think there are other effects besides our greed and short term thinking,

54:56.080 --> 55:01.560
 you know, that we are triggering now with all the greenhouse gases we're putting into

55:01.560 --> 55:02.560
 the atmosphere.

55:02.560 --> 55:04.160
 And that worries me day and night.

55:04.160 --> 55:10.400
 I think about it every single, every moment really, because I really think that's how

55:10.400 --> 55:11.400
 we have to be.

55:11.400 --> 55:23.600
 We have to begin to really focus on how brave the challenge is to our civilization and to

55:23.600 --> 55:30.040
 the other species that are, it's a mass, it is a mass extinction event that we're living

55:30.040 --> 55:35.160
 through and we're seeing it, we're seeing news of it every day.

55:35.160 --> 55:38.680
 So what do you think about another touchy subject?

55:38.680 --> 55:44.160
 What do you think about the politicization of science on topics like global warming and

55:44.160 --> 55:47.560
 Brionic stem cell research and other topics like it?

55:47.560 --> 55:48.560
 What's your sense?

55:48.560 --> 55:49.560
 Why?

55:49.560 --> 55:53.160
 What do you mean by the politicization of global warming?

55:53.160 --> 56:00.640
 Meaning that if you say, I think what you just said, which is global warming is a serious

56:00.640 --> 56:05.200
 concern, it's human cause, there might be some detrimental effects.

56:05.200 --> 56:11.000
 Probably there's a large percent of the population of the United States that would, as opposed

56:11.000 --> 56:20.200
 to listening to that statement, would immediately think, or that's just a liberal talking point.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.200
 That's what I mean by politicization.

56:21.200 --> 56:22.280
 I think that's not so true anymore.

56:22.280 --> 56:30.160
 I don't think our problem is a population that's skeptical about climate change because

56:30.160 --> 56:38.840
 I think that the extreme weather fire events that we are experiencing with such frequency

56:38.840 --> 56:40.760
 is really gotten to people.

56:40.760 --> 56:50.440
 I think that there are people in leadership positions who choose to ignore it and to pretend

56:50.440 --> 56:55.680
 it's not there, but ultimately I think they will be rejected.

56:55.680 --> 56:59.000
 The question is, will it be fast enough?

56:59.000 --> 57:08.760
 But I think actually that most people have really finally taken the reality of global

57:08.760 --> 57:11.600
 climate change to heart.

57:11.600 --> 57:18.720
 They look at their children and grandchildren and they don't feel good because they come

57:18.720 --> 57:26.640
 from a world which was in many ways, in terms of climate, fairly familiar and benign.

57:26.640 --> 57:29.960
 They know that we're headed in another direction and it's not just that.

57:29.960 --> 57:35.520
 It's what we do to the oceans, the rivers, the air.

57:35.520 --> 57:40.240
 You asked me, what is the message of cosmos?

57:40.240 --> 57:47.000
 It's that we have to think in longer terms.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.240
 I think of the Soviet Union and United States and the Cold War and they're ready to kill

57:51.240 --> 57:57.600
 each other over these two different views of the distribution of resources.

57:57.600 --> 58:05.240
 But neither of them has a form of human social organization that thinks in terms of a hundred

58:05.240 --> 58:12.160
 years, let alone a thousand years, which are the time scales that science speaks in.

58:12.160 --> 58:20.240
 That's part of the problem, is that we have to get a grip on reality and where we're headed

58:20.240 --> 58:25.920
 and I'm not fatalistic at all.

58:25.920 --> 58:34.200
 But I do feel like, and in setting out to do this series each season, we were talking

58:34.200 --> 58:41.840
 about climate change in the original cosmos in episode four and warning about inadvertent

58:41.840 --> 58:46.200
 climate modification in 1980.

58:46.200 --> 58:52.200
 And of course, Carl did his PhD thesis on the greenhouse effect on Venus and he was

58:52.200 --> 58:58.200
 painfully cognizant of what a runaway greenhouse effect would do to our planet.

58:58.200 --> 59:02.880
 And not only that, but the climatic history of the planet, which we go into in great detail

59:02.880 --> 59:04.680
 in the series.

59:04.680 --> 59:10.600
 So yeah, I mean, how are we going to get a grip on this if not through some kind of

59:10.600 --> 59:14.320
 understanding of science?

59:14.320 --> 59:22.320
 Can I just say one more thing about science is that its powers of prophecy are astonishing.

59:22.320 --> 59:31.880
 You launched a spacecraft in 1977 and you know where each and every planet in the solar

59:31.880 --> 59:39.280
 system is going to be in every moon and you rendezvous with that flawlessly and you exceed

59:39.280 --> 59:44.840
 the design specifications of the greatest dreams of the engineers.

59:44.840 --> 59:51.560
 And then you go on to explore the Milky Way galaxy and you do it, I mean, you know, the

59:51.560 --> 59:58.480
 climate scientists, some of the people that we, whose stories we tell in cosmos, their

59:58.480 --> 1:00:07.440
 predictions were, and they were working with very early computer modeling capabilities.

1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:13.680
 They have proven to be so robust, nuclear winter, all of these things, this is a prophetic

1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:21.840
 power and yet how crazy that, you know, it's like the Romans with their lead cooking pots

1:00:21.840 --> 1:00:27.680
 and their lead pipes or the Aztecs ripping out their own people's hearts.

1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:35.080
 This is us, we know better and yet we are acting as if its business as usual.

1:00:35.080 --> 1:00:45.160
 Yeah, the beautiful complexity of human nature, speaking of which, let me ask a tough question

1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:49.960
 I guess because there's so many possible answers, but what aspect of life here on earth do you

1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:55.880
 find most fascinating from the origin of life, the evolutionary process itself, the origin

1:00:55.880 --> 1:01:02.560
 of the human mind, so intelligence, some of the technological developments going on now

1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:07.560
 or us venturing out into space or space exploration, what just inspires you?

1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:14.320
 Oh, they all inspire me, everyone knows inspire me, but I'll have to say that to me, as I've

1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:20.480
 gotten older, to me the origin of life has become less interesting.

1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:21.680
 Interesting, wow.

1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:29.680
 Because I feel, well, not because it's more, I think I understand, I have a better grasp

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:31.640
 of how it might have happened.

1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:33.240
 Do you think it was a huge leap?

1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:41.960
 I think it was that we are a byproduct of geophysics and I think it's not, my suspicion

1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:49.360
 of course, which is, take it with a grain of salt, but my suspicion is that it happens

1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:56.160
 more often and more places than we like to think because after all the history of our

1:01:56.160 --> 1:02:01.840
 thinking about ourselves, it's been a constant series of demotions in which we've had to

1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:04.080
 realize, no, no.

1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:05.080
 So to me that's...

1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:06.080
 We're not at the center of the solar system.

1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:12.800
 And the origin of consciousness is to me also not so amazing if you think of it as going

1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:22.200
 back to these one celled organisms of a billion years ago who had to know, well, if I go higher

1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:30.480
 up, I'll get too much sun and if I go lower down, I'll be protected from UV rays, things

1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:31.480
 like that.

1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:34.320
 They had to know that or you, I eat, me, I don't.

1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:36.720
 I mean, even that, I can see.

1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:43.680
 If you know that, then knowing what we know now is just, it's not so hard to fathom.

1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:51.520
 It seems like, I've never believed there was a duality between our minds and our bodies.

1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:57.840
 And I think that even consciousness, all those things seem to me except one of the things

1:02:57.840 --> 1:02:58.840
 of geophysics.

1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:07.040
 Yeah, chemistry, yes, geochemistry, geophysics, absolutely.

1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:12.440
 It makes perfect sense to me and it doesn't make it any less wondrous.

1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:19.320
 It doesn't rob it at all of the wonder of it.

1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:21.600
 And so, yeah, I think that's amazing.

1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:26.720
 I think, you know, we tell the story of someone you have never heard of, I guarantee, and

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:34.080
 I think you're very knowledgeable on the subject who was more responsible for our ability to

1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:40.680
 venture out to other worlds than anyone else and who was completely forgotten.

1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:45.280
 And so, those are the kinds of stories I like best for cosmos, because...

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:46.280
 What did you tell me?

1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:47.280
 Who?

1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:54.720
 I'm going to make you watch the series, I'm going to make you buy my book, but just saying,

1:03:54.720 --> 1:04:03.880
 this person would be forgotten, but the way that we do cosmos is that I ask a question

1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:04.880
 to myself.

1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:10.280
 I really want to get to the bottom to the answer and keep going deeper and deeper until

1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:15.120
 we find what the story is, a story that I know because I'm not a scientist.

1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:22.480
 If it moves me, then I want to tell it, and other people will be moved.

1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:28.840
 Do you ponder mortality, human mortality, and maybe even your own mortality?

1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:30.360
 Oh, all the time.

1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:31.360
 I just turned 70.

1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:34.040
 So, yeah, I think about it a lot.

1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:38.120
 I mean, it's, you know, how can you not think about it?

1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:39.120
 But...

1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:41.760
 What do you make of this short life of ours?

1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:48.120
 I mean, let me ask you sort of another way.

1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:57.440
 You've lost Carl, and speaking of mortality, if you could be, if you could choose immortality,

1:04:57.440 --> 1:05:02.520
 you know, it's possible that science allows us to live much, much longer.

1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:05.480
 Is that something you would choose for yourself, for Carl?

1:05:05.480 --> 1:05:06.480
 For you to...

1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:07.480
 Well, for Carl, definitely.

1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:08.480
 For you to...

1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:12.400
 In a nanosecond, I would take that deal.

1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:13.400
 But not for me.

1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:17.000
 I mean, if Carl were alive, yes, I would want to live forever because, you know, it would

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:18.000
 be fun.

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:19.000
 But, no.

1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:20.000
 Would it be fun forever?

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.000
 I don't know.

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:22.000
 That's the essential nature of the...

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:23.000
 I don't know.

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:29.400
 It's just that the universe is so full of so many wonderful things to discover that it

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:31.560
 feels like it would be fun.

1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:34.800
 But no, I don't want to live forever.

1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:37.720
 I have had a magical life.

1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:44.480
 My, you know, my craziest dreams have come true, and I feel, you know, I forgive me,

1:05:44.480 --> 1:05:56.840
 but this crazy quirk of fate that put my most joyful, deepest feelings, feelings that decades

1:05:56.840 --> 1:06:02.840
 later, 42 years later, I know how real, how true those feelings were.

1:06:02.840 --> 1:06:09.920
 Something that happened after that was an affirmation of how true those feelings were.

1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:12.080
 And so, I don't feel that way.

1:06:12.080 --> 1:06:20.600
 I feel like I have gotten so much more than my share, not just my extraordinary life with

1:06:20.600 --> 1:06:31.120
 Carl, my family, my parents, my children, my friends, the places that I've been able

1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:36.880
 to explore, the books I've read, the music I've heard.

1:06:36.880 --> 1:06:44.400
 So, I feel like, you know, if it be much better, if instead of working on the immortality

1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:51.000
 of the lucky few, of the most privileged people in the society, I would really like to see

1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:55.320
 a concerted effort for us to get us our act together.

1:06:55.320 --> 1:07:04.760
 You know, that to me is topic A, more pressing, you know, this possible world is the challenge.

1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:12.800
 And we're at a kind of moment where if we can make that choice, so immortality doesn't

1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:14.800
 really interest me.

1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:22.440
 I really, I love nature, and I have to say that I, because I'm a product of nature, I

1:07:22.440 --> 1:07:28.280
 recognize that it's great gifts and it's great cruelty.

1:07:28.280 --> 1:07:33.200
 Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it, Annie.

1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:34.200
 Thank you so much for talking to us.

1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:35.200
 It was an honor.

1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:36.200
 Oh, it's wonderful.

1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:37.200
 I really appreciate it.

1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:38.200
 I really enjoyed it.

1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:39.200
 I thought your questions were great.

1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:40.200

 And now, let me leave you some words of wisdom from Carl Sagan.

1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:16.560
 What an astonishing thing a book is.

1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:22.520
 It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots

1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:24.240
 of funny dark squiggles.

1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:29.760
 But one glance at it, and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead

1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:36.320
 for thousands of years, across the millennia, an author speaking clearly and silently inside

1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:39.720
 your head, directly to you.

1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:43.640
 Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions.

1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:50.440
 Joining together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epics.

1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:53.120
 Books break the shackles of time.

1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:59.800
 A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.

1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:14.600
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
