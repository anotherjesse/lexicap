00:00.000 --> 00:03.320
 The following is a conversation with Gilbert Strang.

00:03.320 --> 00:05.760
 He's a professor of mathematics in MIT

00:05.760 --> 00:07.480
 and perhaps one of the most famous

00:07.480 --> 00:10.600
 and impactful teachers of math in the world.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.640
 His MIT OpenCourseWare lectures on linear algebra

00:13.640 --> 00:15.920
 have been viewed millions of times.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.480
 As an undergraduate student,

00:17.480 --> 00:19.960
 I was one of those millions of students.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.760
 There's something inspiring about the way he teaches.

00:22.760 --> 00:26.120
 There's a once calm, simple, yet full of passion

00:26.120 --> 00:29.080
 for the elegance inherent to mathematics.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.240
 I remember doing the exercises in his book,

00:31.240 --> 00:33.000
 Introduction to Linear Algebra,

00:33.000 --> 00:35.880
 and slowly realizing that the world of matrices,

00:35.880 --> 00:39.360
 of vector spaces, of determinants and eigenvalues,

00:39.360 --> 00:43.040
 of geometric transformations and matrix decompositions

00:43.040 --> 00:45.120
 reveal a set of powerful tools

00:45.120 --> 00:47.920
 in the toolbox of artificial intelligence.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.720
 From signals to images,

00:49.720 --> 00:51.880
 from numerical optimization to robotics,

00:51.880 --> 00:54.880
 computer vision, deep learning, computer graphics,

00:54.880 --> 00:56.600
 and everywhere outside AI,

00:56.600 --> 01:00.040
 including, of course, a quantum mechanical study

01:00.040 --> 01:01.520
 of our universe.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.400
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.800
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:06.800 --> 01:08.840
 give it five stars on Apple Podcasts,

01:08.840 --> 01:12.320
 support on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.480
 Alex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.000
 This podcast is supported by Ziprecruiter.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.160
 Hiring great people is hard,

01:21.160 --> 01:23.240
 and to me is the most important element

01:23.240 --> 01:26.040
 of a successful mission driven team.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.080
 I've been fortunate to be a part of

01:28.080 --> 01:30.680
 and to lead several great engineering teams.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.640
 The hiring I've done in the past

01:32.640 --> 01:35.400
 was mostly through tools that we built ourselves,

01:35.400 --> 01:38.360
 but reinventing the wheel was painful.

01:38.360 --> 01:41.200
 Ziprecruiter is a tool that's already available for you.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.960
 It seeks to make hiring simple, fast, and smart.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.920
 For example, codable cofounder Gretchen Hebner

01:47.920 --> 01:50.360
 used Ziprecruiter to find a new game artist

01:50.360 --> 01:52.680
 to join her education tech company.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.800
 By using Ziprecruiter's screening questions

01:54.800 --> 01:56.280
 to filter candidates,

01:56.280 --> 01:59.040
 Gretchen found it easier to focus on the best candidates

01:59.040 --> 02:02.400
 and finally hiring the perfect person for the role

02:02.400 --> 02:05.440
 in less than two weeks from start to finish.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.520
 Ziprecruiter, the smartest way to hire.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.840
 See why Ziprecruiter is effective for businesses

02:10.840 --> 02:14.440
 of all sizes by signing up as I did for free

02:14.440 --> 02:17.560
 at Ziprecruiter.com slash Lex Pod.

02:17.560 --> 02:21.320
 That's Ziprecruiter.com slash Lex Pod.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.360
 This show is presented by Cash App,

02:24.360 --> 02:26.880
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.640
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

02:29.640 --> 02:33.080
 but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.880
 Most Bitcoin exchanges take days

02:34.880 --> 02:37.120
 for a bank transfer to become investable.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.480
 Through Cash App, it takes seconds.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.840
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.600
 You can buy fractions of a stock,

02:44.600 --> 02:47.360
 which to me is a really interesting concept.

02:47.360 --> 02:51.600
 So you can buy $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.560
 Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:54.560 --> 02:58.320
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.120
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

03:00.120 --> 03:02.800
 to support one of my favorite organizations

03:02.800 --> 03:05.760
 that many of you may know and have benefited from,

03:05.760 --> 03:09.200
 called FIRST, best known for their FIRST robotics

03:09.200 --> 03:10.880
 and Lego competitions.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.560
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

03:14.560 --> 03:17.640
 in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating

03:17.640 --> 03:20.600
 on charity navigator, which means the donated money

03:20.600 --> 03:23.920
 is used to maximum effectiveness.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.960
 When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play

03:26.960 --> 03:30.480
 and use code LEX Podcast, you'll get $10

03:30.480 --> 03:33.200
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

03:33.200 --> 03:35.200
 which again, is an organization

03:35.200 --> 03:38.000
 that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
 to dream of engineering a better world.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.760
 And now, here's my conversation with Gilbert Strang.

03:45.840 --> 03:50.480
 How does it feel to be one of the modern day rock stars

03:50.480 --> 03:51.760
 of mathematics?

03:51.760 --> 03:53.880
 I don't feel like a rock star.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.360
 That's kind of crazy for old math person.

03:57.360 --> 04:02.360
 But it's true that the videos in linear algebra

04:03.560 --> 04:07.160
 that I made way back in 2000, I think,

04:08.560 --> 04:09.880
 have been watched a lot.

04:09.880 --> 04:14.440
 And well, partly the importance of linear algebra,

04:14.440 --> 04:17.720
 which I'm sure you'll ask me and give me a chance to say

04:17.720 --> 04:21.200
 that linear algebra as a subject is just surged

04:21.200 --> 04:22.560
 in importance.

04:22.560 --> 04:26.480
 But also, it was a class that I taught a bunch of times.

04:26.480 --> 04:31.480
 So I kind of got it organized and enjoyed doing it.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.200
 It was just, the videos were just the class.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.760
 So they're on open courseware and on YouTube

04:36.760 --> 04:38.880
 and translated, and it's fun.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.080
 But there's something about that chalkboard

04:41.080 --> 04:45.280
 and the simplicity of the way you explain the basic concepts

04:45.280 --> 04:50.280
 in the beginning, to be honest, when I went to undergrad.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.640
 You didn't do linear algebra, probably.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.440
 Of course I did linear algebra.

04:54.440 --> 04:55.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

04:55.440 --> 05:00.320
 But before going through the course at my university,

05:00.320 --> 05:02.280
 I was going through open courseware.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.480
 You were my instructor for linear algebra.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.560
 And that, I mean, we were using your book.

05:07.560 --> 05:12.560
 And I mean, the fact that there is thousands,

05:12.840 --> 05:14.880
 you know, hundreds of thousands, millions of people

05:14.880 --> 05:18.280
 that watch that video, I think that's really powerful.

05:18.280 --> 05:23.280
 So how do you think the idea of putting lectures online,

05:23.720 --> 05:27.280
 what really MIT Open Courseware has innovated?

05:27.280 --> 05:28.720
 That was a wonderful idea.

05:28.720 --> 05:32.760
 You know, I think the story that I've heard

05:32.760 --> 05:36.760
 is the committee was appointed by the president,

05:36.760 --> 05:40.040
 President Vest at that time, a wonderful guy.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.480
 And the idea of the committee was to figure out

05:43.480 --> 05:48.480
 how MIT could be like other universities,

05:48.640 --> 05:52.600
 market the work we were doing.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.480
 And then they didn't see a way.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.240
 And after a weekend and they had an inspiration

05:57.240 --> 06:00.040
 and came back to the president Vest and said,

06:00.040 --> 06:02.280
 what if we just gave it away?

06:02.280 --> 06:07.280
 And he decided that was okay, good idea.

06:07.720 --> 06:08.560
 So...

06:08.560 --> 06:09.640
 You know, that's a crazy idea.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.720
 That's, if we think of a university as a thing

06:12.720 --> 06:14.640
 that creates a product,

06:14.640 --> 06:19.560
 isn't knowledge, the kind of educational knowledge

06:19.560 --> 06:22.640
 isn't the product and giving that away.

06:22.640 --> 06:26.120
 Are you surprised that you went through?

06:26.120 --> 06:28.280
 The result that he did it.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.120
 Well, knowing a little bit President Vest

06:31.120 --> 06:33.000
 was like him, I think.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.080
 And it was really the right idea, you know.

06:37.080 --> 06:42.080
 MIT is a kind of, it's known for being high level,

06:43.200 --> 06:44.880
 technical things.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.320
 And this is the best way we can say,

06:48.320 --> 06:52.600
 tell, we can show what MIT really is like.

06:52.600 --> 06:57.360
 Because in my case, those 1806 videos

06:57.360 --> 06:59.960
 are just teaching the class.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.680
 They were there in 26, 100.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.840
 They're kind of fun to look at.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.400
 People write to me and say,

07:06.400 --> 07:08.240
 oh, you've got a sense of humor,

07:08.240 --> 07:10.880
 but I don't know where that comes through.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.680
 It's somehow friendly with the class.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.080
 I like students.

07:15.080 --> 07:19.240
 And linear algebra, the subject,

07:19.240 --> 07:21.680
 we gotta give the subject most of the credit.

07:21.680 --> 07:26.680
 It really has come forward in importance in these years.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.720
 So let's talk about linear algebra a little bit.

07:32.720 --> 07:36.200
 Cause it is such a, it's both a powerful and a beautiful

07:36.200 --> 07:39.120
 a subfield of mathematics.

07:39.120 --> 07:44.120
 So what's your favorite specific topic in linear algebra

07:44.320 --> 07:46.640
 or even math in general to give a lecture on,

07:46.640 --> 07:50.240
 to convey, to tell a story, to teach students?

07:50.240 --> 07:51.080
 Okay.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.480
 Well, on the teaching side,

07:54.480 --> 07:56.800
 so it's not deep mathematics at all,

07:56.800 --> 08:01.800
 but I'm kind of proud of the idea of the four subspaces,

08:01.800 --> 08:05.840
 the four fundamental subspaces,

08:05.840 --> 08:09.640
 which are of course known before,

08:09.640 --> 08:13.720
 long before my name for them, but...

08:13.720 --> 08:14.720
 Can you go through them?

08:14.720 --> 08:15.560
 Can you go through the four subspaces?

08:15.560 --> 08:16.400
 Sure I can.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.240
 Yeah.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.640
 So the first one to understand is,

08:19.640 --> 08:22.960
 so the matrix, maybe I should say the matrix.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.800
 What is the matrix?

08:23.800 --> 08:24.880
 What's a matrix?

08:24.880 --> 08:28.520
 Well, so we have like a rectangle of numbers.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.280
 So it's got n columns, got a bunch of columns

08:32.280 --> 08:36.520
 and also got an m rows, let's say.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.960
 And the relation between,

08:37.960 --> 08:39.880
 so of course the columns and the rows,

08:39.880 --> 08:41.640
 it's the same numbers.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.360
 So there's gotta be connections there,

08:44.360 --> 08:45.720
 but they're not simple.

08:45.720 --> 08:50.080
 The columns might be longer than the rows

08:50.080 --> 08:51.680
 and they're all different.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.720
 The numbers are mixed up.

08:53.720 --> 08:57.760
 First space to think about is, take the columns.

08:57.760 --> 09:01.880
 So those are vectors, those are points in dimensions.

09:01.880 --> 09:02.720
 What's a vector?

09:02.720 --> 09:05.680
 So a fist test would imagine a vector

09:05.680 --> 09:10.680
 or might imagine a vector as a arrow in space

09:10.880 --> 09:14.840
 or the point it ends at in space.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.400
 For me, it's a column of numbers.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.960
 You often think of, this is very interesting

09:20.960 --> 09:24.000
 in terms of linear algebra, in terms of a vector.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.680
 You think a little bit more abstract

09:26.680 --> 09:30.600
 than how it's very commonly used perhaps.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.640
 You think this arbitrary multidimensional space.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.160
 I'm right away, I'm in high dimensions and in the...

09:38.160 --> 09:39.000
 Dreamland.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.440
 Yeah, that's right, in the lecture, I try to...

09:42.440 --> 09:46.760
 So if you think of two vectors in 10 dimensions,

09:46.760 --> 09:50.440
 I'll do this in class and I'll readily admit

09:50.440 --> 09:54.360
 that I have no good image in my mind

09:54.360 --> 09:58.280
 of a vector of an arrow in 10 dimensional space,

09:58.280 --> 10:03.280
 but whatever, you can add one bunch of 10 numbers

10:03.760 --> 10:05.320
 to another bunch of 10 numbers.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.080
 So you can add a vector to a vector

10:08.080 --> 10:10.320
 and you can multiply a vector by three.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.200
 And that's, if you know how to do those,

10:12.200 --> 10:14.120
 you've got linear algebra.

10:14.120 --> 10:18.160
 You know, 10 dimensions, there's this beautiful thing

10:18.160 --> 10:20.240
 about math, if you look at string theory

10:20.240 --> 10:21.720
 and all these theories,

10:21.720 --> 10:24.480
 which are really fundamentally derived through math,

10:24.480 --> 10:26.520
 but are very difficult to visualize.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.920
 How do you think about the things

10:28.920 --> 10:31.160
 like a 10 dimensional vector

10:31.160 --> 10:33.040
 that we can't really visualize?

10:35.040 --> 10:38.360
 And yet math reveals some beauty

10:38.360 --> 10:43.360
 underlying our world in that weird thing we can't visualize.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.040
 How do you think about that difference?

10:46.040 --> 10:48.960
 Well, probably I'm not a very geometric person,

10:48.960 --> 10:51.760
 so I'm probably thinking in three dimensions

10:51.760 --> 10:54.120
 and the beauty of linear algebra is that

10:55.560 --> 10:58.240
 it goes on to 10 dimensions with no problem.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.280
 I mean, if you're just seeing what happens

11:01.280 --> 11:04.640
 if you add two vectors in 3D,

11:04.640 --> 11:06.480
 you then you can add them in 10D.

11:06.480 --> 11:10.920
 You're just adding the 10 components.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.880
 So I can't say that I have a picture,

11:14.880 --> 11:16.880
 but yet I try to push the class

11:16.880 --> 11:21.200
 to think of a flat surface in 10 dimensions.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.400
 So a plane in 10 dimensions.

11:23.400 --> 11:27.160
 And so that's one of the spaces.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.880
 Take all the columns of the matrix,

11:29.880 --> 11:31.760
 take all their combinations,

11:31.760 --> 11:35.160
 so much of this column, so much of this one.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.800
 Then if you put all those together,

11:36.800 --> 11:39.960
 you get some kind of a flat surface

11:39.960 --> 11:44.680
 that I call a vector space, space of vectors.

11:44.680 --> 11:47.240
 And my imagination is just seeing

11:47.240 --> 11:50.240
 like a piece of paper in 3D.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.600
 But anyway, so that's one of the spaces,

11:54.600 --> 11:55.920
 that's space number one,

11:55.920 --> 11:58.440
 the column space of the matrix.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.040
 And then there's the row space,

12:00.040 --> 12:02.160
 which is, as I said, different,

12:02.160 --> 12:04.760
 but came from the same numbers.

12:04.760 --> 12:07.080
 So we got the column space,

12:07.080 --> 12:10.040
 all combinations of the columns.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.960
 And then we got the row space,

12:11.960 --> 12:14.560
 all combinations of the rows.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.520
 So those words are easy for me to say,

12:17.520 --> 12:20.240
 and I can't really draw them on a blackboard,

12:20.240 --> 12:22.560
 but I try with my thick chalk.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.880
 Everybody likes that railroad chalk.

12:25.880 --> 12:30.240
 And me too, I wouldn't use anything else now.

12:30.240 --> 12:35.040
 And then the other two spaces are perpendicular to those.

12:35.040 --> 12:39.080
 So like if you have a plane in 3D,

12:39.080 --> 12:43.520
 just a plane is just a flat surface in 3D,

12:43.520 --> 12:47.040
 then perpendicular to that plane would be a line.

12:47.040 --> 12:50.200
 So that would be the null space.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.760
 So we've got two, we've got a column space,

12:52.760 --> 12:56.920
 a row space, and there are two perpendicular spaces.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.720
 So those four fit together

12:58.720 --> 13:02.480
 in a beautiful picture of a matrix.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.400
 Yeah, yeah, it's sort of fundamental.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.760
 It's not a difficult idea.

13:06.760 --> 13:11.260
 It comes pretty early in 1806, and it's basic.

13:11.260 --> 13:16.260
 So planes in these multi dimensional spaces,

13:16.380 --> 13:19.740
 how difficult of an idea is that to come to?

13:19.740 --> 13:23.660
 Do you think if you look back in time,

13:23.660 --> 13:26.820
 I think mathematically it makes sense,

13:26.820 --> 13:29.580
 but I don't know if it's intuitive for us to imagine,

13:29.580 --> 13:31.100
 just as what we're talking about.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.780
 Feels like calculus is easier to intuit.

13:34.780 --> 13:38.420
 Well, calculus, I have to admit calculus came earlier,

13:38.420 --> 13:39.860
 earlier than linear algebra.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.180
 So Newton and Leibniz were the great men

13:42.180 --> 13:45.780
 to understand the key ideas of calculus.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.460
 But linear algebra to me is like,

13:49.460 --> 13:51.620
 okay, it's the starting point,

13:51.620 --> 13:54.140
 because it's all about flat things.

13:54.140 --> 13:57.140
 Calculus has got all the complications of calculus

13:57.140 --> 14:02.140
 come from the curves, the bending, the curved surfaces.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.880
 Linear algebra, the surfaces are all flat.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.020
 Nothing bends in linear algebra.

14:08.020 --> 14:11.660
 So it should have come first, but it didn't.

14:11.660 --> 14:16.660
 And calculus also comes first in high school classes,

14:17.460 --> 14:20.860
 and in college class, it'll be freshman math,

14:20.860 --> 14:22.340
 it'll be calculus.

14:22.340 --> 14:24.340
 And then I say, enough of it.

14:24.340 --> 14:27.820
 Like, okay, get to the good stuff.

14:27.820 --> 14:28.900
 And that's...

14:28.900 --> 14:30.900
 Do you think linear algebra should come first?

14:30.900 --> 14:34.700
 Well, it really, I'm okay with it not coming first,

14:34.700 --> 14:37.100
 but it should, yeah, it should.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.180
 It's simpler.

14:39.180 --> 14:40.180
 Because everything's flat.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.660
 Yeah, everything's flat.

14:41.660 --> 14:43.580
 Well, of course, for that reason,

14:43.580 --> 14:46.620
 calculus sort of sticks to one dimension,

14:46.620 --> 14:49.500
 or eventually you do multivariate,

14:49.500 --> 14:52.260
 but that basically means two dimensions.

14:52.260 --> 14:55.540
 Linear algebra, you take off into 10 dimensions, no problem.

14:55.540 --> 14:57.620
 It just feels scary and dangerous

14:57.620 --> 14:59.820
 to go beyond two dimensions, that's all.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.700
 If everything's flat, you can't go wrong.

15:03.700 --> 15:08.700
 So what concept or theorem in linear algebra or in math

15:09.780 --> 15:12.700
 you find most beautiful?

15:12.700 --> 15:15.420
 That gives you pause that leaves you in awe?

15:15.420 --> 15:18.060
 Well, I'll stick with linear algebra here.

15:18.060 --> 15:21.340
 I hope the viewer knows that really mathematics

15:21.340 --> 15:23.420
 is an amazing, amazing subject

15:23.420 --> 15:28.420
 and deep connections between ideas

15:28.740 --> 15:30.700
 that didn't look connected.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.620
 Some, they turned out they were.

15:32.620 --> 15:35.580
 But if we stick with linear algebra,

15:35.580 --> 15:38.780
 so we have a matrix, that's like the basic thing,

15:38.780 --> 15:40.740
 a rectangle of numbers.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.660
 And it might be a rectangle of data,

15:42.660 --> 15:46.780
 you're probably gonna ask me later about data science,

15:46.780 --> 15:50.420
 where often data comes in a matrix,

15:50.420 --> 15:54.980
 you have maybe every column corresponds

15:54.980 --> 15:59.980
 to a drug and every row corresponds to a patient.

15:59.980 --> 16:04.980
 And if the patient reacted favorably to the drug,

16:06.580 --> 16:09.180
 then you put up some positive number in there.

16:09.180 --> 16:14.180
 Anyway, rectangle of numbers, matrix is basic.

16:15.140 --> 16:19.180
 So the big problem is to understand all those numbers.

16:19.180 --> 16:21.980
 You got a big set of numbers.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.620
 And what are the patterns, what's going on?

16:24.620 --> 16:29.620
 And so one of the ways to break down that

16:29.620 --> 16:33.540
 matrix into simple pieces is,

16:33.540 --> 16:37.100
 uses something called singular values.

16:37.100 --> 16:42.100
 And that's come on as fundamental in the last

16:42.540 --> 16:44.500
 and certainly in my lifetime.

16:45.580 --> 16:50.100
 Eigen values, if you have viewers who've done engineering

16:50.100 --> 16:54.340
 math or basic linear algebra,

16:54.340 --> 16:56.140
 Eigen values were in there.

16:56.140 --> 17:00.180
 But those are restricted to square matrices

17:00.180 --> 17:02.740
 and data comes in rectangular matrices.

17:02.740 --> 17:05.700
 So you gotta take that next step.

17:05.700 --> 17:10.700
 I'm always pushing math faculty, get on, do it, do it,

17:11.300 --> 17:14.140
 do it, singular values.

17:14.140 --> 17:19.140
 So those are a way to find the important pieces

17:21.460 --> 17:24.860
 of the matrix, which add up to the whole matrix.

17:24.860 --> 17:29.060
 So you're breaking a matrix into simple pieces.

17:29.060 --> 17:33.260
 And the first piece is the most important part of the data,

17:33.260 --> 17:36.180
 the second piece is the second most important part.

17:36.180 --> 17:41.180
 And then often, so a data scientist will like,

17:41.540 --> 17:46.540
 if a data scientist can find those first and second pieces,

17:46.540 --> 17:54.820
 stop there, the rest of the data is probably round off,

17:54.820 --> 17:57.620
 experimental error maybe.

17:57.620 --> 18:00.180
 So you're looking for the important part.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.020
 So what do you find beautiful about singular values?

18:03.020 --> 18:06.260
 Well, yeah, I didn't give the theorem.

18:06.260 --> 18:09.380
 So here's the idea of singular values.

18:09.380 --> 18:14.100
 Every matrix, every matrix, rectangular, square,

18:14.100 --> 18:16.980
 whatever, can be written as a product

18:16.980 --> 18:20.020
 of three very simple special matrices.

18:20.020 --> 18:21.340
 So that's the theorem.

18:21.340 --> 18:24.620
 Every matrix can be written as a rotation

18:24.620 --> 18:28.820
 times a stretch, which is just a matrix,

18:28.820 --> 18:31.660
 a diagonal matrix, otherwise all zeros

18:31.660 --> 18:34.220
 except on the one diagonal.

18:34.220 --> 18:37.980
 And then the third factor is another rotation.

18:37.980 --> 18:42.620
 So rotation, stretch, rotation is the breakup

18:42.620 --> 18:45.940
 of any matrix.

18:45.940 --> 18:48.460
 The structure, the ability that you can do that,

18:48.460 --> 18:49.860
 what do you find appealing?

18:49.860 --> 18:51.060
 What do you find beautiful about it?

18:51.060 --> 18:54.260
 Well, geometrically, as I freely admit,

18:54.260 --> 18:59.260
 the action of a matrix is not so easy to visualize,

18:59.620 --> 19:02.380
 but everybody can visualize a rotation.

19:02.380 --> 19:06.340
 Take two dimensional space and just turn it

19:07.780 --> 19:09.260
 around the center.

19:09.260 --> 19:10.740
 Take three dimensional space.

19:10.740 --> 19:13.540
 So a pilot has to know about, well,

19:13.540 --> 19:16.860
 what are the three, yaw is one of them?

19:16.860 --> 19:20.780
 I've forgotten all the three turns that a pilot makes.

19:22.260 --> 19:25.460
 Up to 10 dimensions, you've got 10 ways to turn,

19:25.460 --> 19:28.540
 but you can visualize a rotation.

19:28.540 --> 19:30.300
 Take the space and turn it.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.100
 And you can visualize a stretch.

19:32.100 --> 19:37.100
 So to break a matrix with all those numbers in it

19:37.100 --> 19:42.100
 into something you can visualize, rotate, stretch, rotate.

19:42.380 --> 19:43.620
 It's pretty neat.

19:43.620 --> 19:44.460
 It's pretty neat.

19:44.460 --> 19:45.580
 That's pretty powerful.

19:46.580 --> 19:50.580
 On YouTube, just consuming a bunch of videos

19:50.580 --> 19:52.660
 and just watching what people connect with

19:52.660 --> 19:56.060
 and what they really enjoy and are inspired by,

19:56.060 --> 19:58.340
 math seems to come up again and again.

20:00.140 --> 20:02.660
 I'm trying to understand why that is.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.340
 Perhaps you can help give me clues.

20:05.340 --> 20:10.340
 So it's not just the kinds of lectures that you give,

20:10.780 --> 20:13.140
 but it's also just other folks

20:13.140 --> 20:15.300
 like with Numberphile, there's a channel

20:15.300 --> 20:16.980
 where they just chat about things

20:16.980 --> 20:19.900
 that are extremely complicated, actually.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.980
 People nevertheless connect with them.

20:22.860 --> 20:24.620
 What do you think that is?

20:24.620 --> 20:25.860
 It's wonderful, isn't it?

20:25.860 --> 20:28.540
 I mean, I wasn't really aware of it.

20:28.540 --> 20:33.540
 We're conditioned to think math is hard, math is abstract,

20:33.660 --> 20:35.300
 math is just for a few people,

20:35.300 --> 20:36.620
 but it isn't that way.

20:36.620 --> 20:41.620
 A lot of people quite like math and I get messages

20:42.540 --> 20:45.060
 from people saying, you know, now I'm retired,

20:45.060 --> 20:46.820
 I'm gonna learn some more math.

20:46.820 --> 20:49.980
 I get a lot of those, it's really encouraging.

20:49.980 --> 20:53.500
 And I think what people like is that there's some order,

20:53.500 --> 20:58.500
 a lot of order and things are not obvious,

20:58.860 --> 21:00.420
 but they're true.

21:00.420 --> 21:05.420
 So it's really cheering to think that so many people

21:06.180 --> 21:08.980
 really want to learn more about math.

21:08.980 --> 21:12.980
 In terms of truth, again, I'm sorry to slide

21:14.300 --> 21:18.860
 into philosophy at times, but math does reveal

21:18.860 --> 21:21.900
 pretty strongly what things are true.

21:21.900 --> 21:24.060
 I mean, that's the whole point of proving things.

21:24.060 --> 21:29.060
 And yet sort of our real world is messy and complicated.

21:30.820 --> 21:33.220
 What do you think about the nature of truth

21:33.220 --> 21:34.660
 that math reveals?

21:34.660 --> 21:35.500
 Oh, wow.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.980
 Because it is a source of comfort, like you've mentioned.

21:37.980 --> 21:39.540
 Yeah, that's right.

21:39.540 --> 21:43.020
 Well, I have to say, I'm not much of a philosopher.

21:43.020 --> 21:45.820
 I just like numbers, you know, as a kid,

21:47.100 --> 21:52.100
 this was before you had to go in

21:52.100 --> 21:54.060
 when you had a filling in your teeth,

21:54.060 --> 21:56.060
 you had to kind of just take it.

21:56.060 --> 21:59.220
 So what I did was think about math,

21:59.220 --> 22:03.100
 like take powers of two, two, four, eight, 16,

22:03.100 --> 22:05.900
 up until the time the tooth stopped hurting

22:05.900 --> 22:07.700
 and the dentist said you're through.

22:08.700 --> 22:11.620
 Or counting, yeah, so.

22:11.620 --> 22:14.740
 So that was a source of just, a source of peace, almost.

22:14.740 --> 22:16.580
 Yeah.

22:16.580 --> 22:19.740
 What is it about math do you think that brings that?

22:19.740 --> 22:20.580
 Yeah.

22:20.580 --> 22:21.420
 What is that?

22:21.420 --> 22:22.460
 I don't know where you are.

22:22.460 --> 22:25.900
 Yeah, symmetry, it's certainty.

22:25.900 --> 22:29.380
 The fact that, you know, if you multiply two

22:29.380 --> 22:33.300
 by itself 10 times, you get 1,024 period.

22:33.300 --> 22:34.980
 Everybody's gonna get that.

22:34.980 --> 22:39.100
 Do you see math as a powerful tool or as an art form?

22:39.100 --> 22:42.500
 So it's both, that's really one of the neat things.

22:42.500 --> 22:46.460
 You can be an artist and like math,

22:46.460 --> 22:51.020
 you can be an engineer and use math.

22:51.020 --> 22:51.980
 Which are you?

22:51.980 --> 22:52.820
 Which?

22:52.820 --> 22:53.660
 Which am I?

22:53.660 --> 22:54.900
 What did you connect with most?

22:54.900 --> 22:57.380
 Yeah, I'm somewhere between.

22:57.380 --> 23:01.620
 I'm certainly not a artist type, philosopher type person.

23:01.620 --> 23:04.180
 Might sound that way this morning, but I'm not.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.700
 Yeah, I really enjoy teaching engineers

23:09.700 --> 23:13.300
 because they go for an answer.

23:13.300 --> 23:18.300
 And yeah, so probably within the MIT Math Department,

23:18.300 --> 23:23.220
 most people enjoy teaching students

23:23.220 --> 23:25.580
 who get the abstract idea.

23:25.580 --> 23:30.580
 I'm okay with, I'm good with engineers

23:30.820 --> 23:33.180
 who are looking for a way to find answers.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.020
 Yeah.

23:34.020 --> 23:36.380
 Actually, that's an interesting question.

23:36.380 --> 23:39.820
 Do you think for teaching and in general,

23:39.820 --> 23:41.300
 thinking about new concepts,

23:41.300 --> 23:44.340
 do you think it's better to plug in the numbers

23:44.340 --> 23:47.340
 or to think more abstractly?

23:47.340 --> 23:51.340
 So looking at theorems and proving the theorems

23:51.340 --> 23:56.340
 or actually building up a basic intuition of the theorem

23:56.340 --> 23:57.900
 or the methodology approach

23:57.900 --> 24:01.060
 and then just plugging in numbers and seeing it work?

24:01.060 --> 24:06.060
 Yeah, well, certainly many of us like to see examples.

24:07.180 --> 24:08.980
 First, we understand,

24:08.980 --> 24:11.940
 it might be a pretty abstract sounding example

24:11.940 --> 24:14.620
 like a three dimensional rotation.

24:14.620 --> 24:19.620
 How are you gonna understand a rotation in 3D?

24:20.620 --> 24:21.940
 Or in 10D?

24:25.940 --> 24:28.940
 And then some of us like to keep going with it

24:28.940 --> 24:30.620
 to the point where you got numbers,

24:30.620 --> 24:34.940
 where you got 10 angles, 10 axes, 10 angles.

24:34.940 --> 24:39.940
 But the best, the great mathematicians is probably,

24:40.940 --> 24:41.940
 I don't know if they do that

24:41.940 --> 24:46.940
 because for them, an example would be

24:48.940 --> 24:51.940
 a highly abstract thing to the rest of us.

24:51.940 --> 24:54.940
 Right, but nevertheless working in the space of examples.

24:54.940 --> 24:55.940
 Yeah, examples.

24:55.940 --> 24:56.940
 It seems to...

24:56.940 --> 24:58.940
 It's examples of structure.

24:58.940 --> 25:00.940
 Our brains seem to connect with that.

25:00.940 --> 25:01.940
 Yeah, yeah.

25:01.940 --> 25:04.940
 So I'm not sure if you're familiar with them

25:04.940 --> 25:07.940
 but Andrew Yang is a presidential candidate

25:08.940 --> 25:12.940
 currently running with math

25:12.940 --> 25:15.940
 in all capital letters and his hats as a slogan.

25:15.940 --> 25:16.940
 I see.

25:16.940 --> 25:18.940
 Stands for make America think hard.

25:18.940 --> 25:20.940
 Okay, I'll vote for him.

25:22.940 --> 25:25.940
 And his name rhymes with yours, Yang Strang.

25:25.940 --> 25:28.940
 But he also loves math and he comes from that world

25:28.940 --> 25:33.940
 but he also looking at it makes me realize

25:33.940 --> 25:35.940
 that math, science, and engineering

25:35.940 --> 25:38.940
 are not really part of our politics,

25:38.940 --> 25:41.940
 political discourse about political life,

25:41.940 --> 25:42.940
 government in general.

25:42.940 --> 25:43.940
 Yeah.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.940
 Why do you think that is?

25:45.940 --> 25:46.940
 Well...

25:46.940 --> 25:48.940
 What are your thoughts on that in general?

25:48.940 --> 25:50.940
 Well, certainly somewhere in the system

25:50.940 --> 25:54.940
 we need people who are comfortable with numbers,

25:54.940 --> 25:56.940
 comfortable with quantities,

25:56.940 --> 26:00.940
 you know, if you say this leads to that,

26:00.940 --> 26:04.940
 they see it and it's undeniable.

26:04.940 --> 26:08.940
 But isn't that strange to you that we have almost no...

26:08.940 --> 26:12.940
 I mean, I'm pretty sure we have no elected officials

26:12.940 --> 26:16.940
 in Congress or obviously the president

26:16.940 --> 26:21.940
 that either has an engineering degree or math.

26:21.940 --> 26:23.940
 Yeah, well, that's too bad.

26:23.940 --> 26:26.940
 A few could...

26:26.940 --> 26:29.940
 A few who could make the connection.

26:29.940 --> 26:32.940
 Yeah, it would have to be people who are...

26:32.940 --> 26:35.940
 who understand engineering or science

26:35.940 --> 26:42.940
 and at the same time can make speeches and lead.

26:42.940 --> 26:43.940
 Yeah.

26:43.940 --> 26:44.940
 Yeah, inspire people.

26:44.940 --> 26:45.940
 Yeah, inspire.

26:45.940 --> 26:46.940
 Yeah.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.940
 You were, speaking of inspiration,

26:48.940 --> 26:51.940
 the president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

26:51.940 --> 26:53.940
 Oh, yes.

26:53.940 --> 26:56.940
 It's a major organization in math and applied math.

26:56.940 --> 26:59.940
 What do you see as a role of that society,

26:59.940 --> 27:01.940
 you know, in our public discourse?

27:01.940 --> 27:02.940
 Right.

27:02.940 --> 27:03.940
 In public?

27:03.940 --> 27:04.940
 Yeah.

27:04.940 --> 27:07.940
 So, well, it was fun to be president at the time.

27:07.940 --> 27:08.940
 A couple years.

27:08.940 --> 27:09.940
 Two years.

27:09.940 --> 27:12.940
 Two years, around 2000.

27:12.940 --> 27:16.940
 There's hope that's present of a pretty small society.

27:16.940 --> 27:20.940
 But nevertheless, it was a time when math was getting some...

27:20.940 --> 27:23.940
 more attention in Washington.

27:23.940 --> 27:28.940
 But, yeah, I got to give a little 10 minutes

27:28.940 --> 27:32.940
 to a committee of the House of Representatives

27:32.940 --> 27:34.940
 talking about who I met.

27:34.940 --> 27:36.940
 And then, actually, it was fun,

27:36.940 --> 27:41.940
 because one of the members of the House

27:41.940 --> 27:43.940
 had been a student, had been in my class.

27:43.940 --> 27:45.940
 What do you think of that?

27:45.940 --> 27:47.940
 Yeah, as you say, a pretty rare.

27:47.940 --> 27:50.940
 Most members of the House have had a different training,

27:50.940 --> 27:52.940
 different background,

27:52.940 --> 27:55.940
 but there was one from New Hampshire

27:55.940 --> 28:01.940
 who was my friend, really, by being in the class.

28:01.940 --> 28:02.940
 Yeah.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.940
 So, those years were good.

28:04.940 --> 28:09.940
 Then, of course, other things take over

28:09.940 --> 28:11.940
 and importance in Washington.

28:11.940 --> 28:17.940
 And math, just at this point, is not so visible.

28:17.940 --> 28:19.940
 But for a little moment, it was.

28:19.940 --> 28:22.940
 There's some excitement, some concern

28:22.940 --> 28:25.940
 about artificial intelligence in Washington now.

28:25.940 --> 28:26.940
 Yes, sure.

28:26.940 --> 28:27.940
 About the future.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.940
 And I think at the core of that is math.

28:29.940 --> 28:31.940
 Well, it is, yeah.

28:31.940 --> 28:32.940
 Maybe it's hidden.

28:32.940 --> 28:34.940
 Maybe it's wearing a different hat.

28:34.940 --> 28:37.940
 Well, artificial intelligence,

28:37.940 --> 28:40.940
 and particularly, can I use the words, deep learning,

28:40.940 --> 28:43.940
 if the deep learning is a particular approach

28:43.940 --> 28:46.940
 to understanding data.

28:46.940 --> 28:49.940
 Again, you've got a big whole lot of data.

28:49.940 --> 28:55.940
 Data is just swamping the computers of the world

28:55.940 --> 28:58.940
 and to understand it,

28:58.940 --> 29:01.940
 to out of all those numbers to find what's important

29:01.940 --> 29:04.940
 in climate and everything.

29:04.940 --> 29:07.940
 And artificial intelligence is two words

29:07.940 --> 29:10.940
 for one approach to data.

29:10.940 --> 29:14.940
 Deep learning is a specific approach there,

29:14.940 --> 29:16.940
 which uses a lot of linear algebra.

29:16.940 --> 29:18.940
 So, I got into it.

29:18.940 --> 29:20.940
 I thought, okay, I've got to learn about this.

29:20.940 --> 29:23.940
 So, maybe from your perspective,

29:23.940 --> 29:26.940
 let me ask the most basic question.

29:26.940 --> 29:27.940
 Yeah.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.940
 How do you think of a neural network?

29:29.940 --> 29:30.940
 What is a neural network?

29:30.940 --> 29:31.940
 Yeah, okay.

29:31.940 --> 29:36.940
 So, can I start with the idea about deep learning?

29:36.940 --> 29:37.940
 What does that mean?

29:37.940 --> 29:38.940
 Sure.

29:38.940 --> 29:39.940
 What is deep learning?

29:39.940 --> 29:40.940
 What is deep learning?

29:40.940 --> 29:41.940
 Yeah.

29:41.940 --> 29:45.940
 So, we're trying to learn from all this data,

29:45.940 --> 29:47.940
 we're trying to learn what's important,

29:47.940 --> 29:49.940
 what's it telling us.

29:49.940 --> 29:52.940
 So, you've got data.

29:52.940 --> 29:56.940
 You've got some inputs for which you know the right outputs.

29:56.940 --> 30:01.940
 The question is, can you see the pattern there?

30:01.940 --> 30:03.940
 Can you figure out a way for a new input,

30:03.940 --> 30:07.940
 which we haven't seen, to get the,

30:07.940 --> 30:11.940
 to understand what the output will be from that new input.

30:11.940 --> 30:14.940
 So, we've got a million inputs with their outputs.

30:14.940 --> 30:18.940
 So, we're trying to create some pattern,

30:18.940 --> 30:21.940
 some rule that will take those inputs,

30:21.940 --> 30:23.940
 those million training inputs,

30:23.940 --> 30:27.940
 which we know about, to the correct million outputs.

30:27.940 --> 30:34.940
 And this idea of a neural net is part of the structure

30:34.940 --> 30:40.940
 of our new way to create a rule.

30:40.940 --> 30:45.940
 We're looking for a rule that will take these training inputs

30:45.940 --> 30:47.940
 to the known outputs.

30:47.940 --> 30:51.940
 And then we're going to use that rule on new inputs

30:51.940 --> 30:55.940
 that we don't know the output and see what comes.

30:55.940 --> 30:58.940
 Linear algebra is a big part of defining that rule.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.940
 That's right. Linear algebra is a big part.

31:01.940 --> 31:03.940
 Not all the part.

31:03.940 --> 31:07.940
 People were leaning on matrices, that's good, still do.

31:07.940 --> 31:09.940
 Linear is something special.

31:09.940 --> 31:13.940
 It's all about straight lines and flat planes.

31:13.940 --> 31:18.940
 And data isn't quite like that, you know.

31:18.940 --> 31:20.940
 It's more complicated.

31:20.940 --> 31:23.940
 So, you've got to introduce some complication.

31:23.940 --> 31:26.940
 You have to have some function that's not a straight line.

31:26.940 --> 31:30.940
 And it turned out nonlinear, nonlinear, not linear.

31:30.940 --> 31:34.940
 And it turned out that it was enough to use the function

31:34.940 --> 31:37.940
 that's one straight line and then a different one.

31:37.940 --> 31:40.940
 Halfway, so piecewise linear.

31:40.940 --> 31:44.940
 One piece has one slope, one piece,

31:44.940 --> 31:46.940
 the other piece has a second slope.

31:46.940 --> 31:51.940
 And so, getting that nonlinear,

31:51.940 --> 31:55.940
 simple nonlinearity in blew the problem open.

31:55.940 --> 31:57.940
 That little piece makes it sufficiently complicated

31:57.940 --> 31:59.940
 to make things interesting.

31:59.940 --> 32:01.940
 Exactly, because you're going to use that piece

32:01.940 --> 32:03.940
 over and over a million times.

32:03.940 --> 32:07.940
 So, it has a fold in the graph.

32:07.940 --> 32:09.940
 The graph is two pieces.

32:09.940 --> 32:12.940
 But when you fold something a million times,

32:12.940 --> 32:16.940
 you've got a pretty complicated function

32:16.940 --> 32:18.940
 that's pretty realistic.

32:18.940 --> 32:21.940
 So, that's the thing about neural networks is

32:21.940 --> 32:23.940
 they have a lot of these.

32:23.940 --> 32:24.940
 A lot of these.

32:24.940 --> 32:28.940
 So, why do you think neural networks

32:28.940 --> 32:34.940
 by using a, so formulating an objective function,

32:34.940 --> 32:38.940
 very not a plain function of the,

32:38.940 --> 32:41.940
 lots of folds of the inputs, the outputs,

32:41.940 --> 32:46.940
 why do you think they work to be able to find a rule

32:46.940 --> 32:48.940
 that we don't know is optimal,

32:48.940 --> 32:52.940
 but it just seems to be pretty good in a lot of cases.

32:52.940 --> 32:54.940
 What's your intuition?

32:54.940 --> 32:57.940
 Is it surprising to you as it is to many people?

32:57.940 --> 33:00.940
 Do you have an intuition of why this works at all?

33:00.940 --> 33:03.940
 Well, I'm beginning to have a better intuition.

33:03.940 --> 33:07.940
 This idea of things that are piecewise linear,

33:07.940 --> 33:11.940
 flat pieces, but with folds between them.

33:11.940 --> 33:16.940
 Like, think of a roof of an infinitely complicated house

33:16.940 --> 33:20.940
 or something, that curve, it almost curved,

33:20.940 --> 33:23.940
 but every piece is flat.

33:23.940 --> 33:26.940
 That's been used by engineers.

33:26.940 --> 33:30.940
 That idea has been used by engineers, is used by engineers.

33:30.940 --> 33:33.940
 Big time, something called the finite element method.

33:33.940 --> 33:36.940
 If you want to design a bridge,

33:36.940 --> 33:40.940
 design a building, design an airplane,

33:40.940 --> 33:45.940
 you're using this idea of piecewise flat

33:45.940 --> 33:51.940
 as a good, simple, computable approximation.

33:51.940 --> 33:56.940
 But you have a sense that there's a lot of expressive power

33:56.940 --> 33:58.940
 in this kind of piecewise linear.

33:58.940 --> 34:00.940
 You use the right word.

34:00.940 --> 34:03.940
 If you measure the expressivity,

34:03.940 --> 34:09.940
 how complicated a thing can this piecewise flat guy's

34:09.940 --> 34:14.940
 express, the answer is very complicated.

34:14.940 --> 34:19.940
 What do you think are the limits of such piecewise linear

34:19.940 --> 34:23.940
 or just neural networks, the expressivity of neural networks?

34:23.940 --> 34:25.940
 Well, you would have said a while ago

34:25.940 --> 34:28.940
 that they're just computational limits.

34:28.940 --> 34:32.940
 It's a problem beyond a certain size.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.940
 A supercomputer isn't going to do it.

34:35.940 --> 34:38.940
 But those keep getting more powerful.

34:38.940 --> 34:43.940
 So that limit has been moved to allow

34:43.940 --> 34:46.940
 more and more complicated surfaces.

34:46.940 --> 34:51.940
 So in terms of just mapping from inputs to outputs,

34:51.940 --> 34:57.940
 looking at data, what do you think of,

34:57.940 --> 34:59.940
 in the context in neural networks in general,

34:59.940 --> 35:04.940
 data is just tensors, vectors, matrices, tensors.

35:04.940 --> 35:09.940
 How do you think about learning from data?

35:09.940 --> 35:12.940
 How much of our world can be expressed in this way?

35:12.940 --> 35:15.940
 How useful is this process?

35:15.940 --> 35:17.940
 I guess that's another way to ask,

35:17.940 --> 35:19.940
 what are the limits of this approach?

35:19.940 --> 35:21.940
 Well, that's a good question, yeah.

35:21.940 --> 35:23.940
 So I guess the whole idea of deep learning

35:23.940 --> 35:25.940
 is that there's something there to learn.

35:25.940 --> 35:28.940
 If the data is totally random,

35:28.940 --> 35:30.940
 just produced by random number generators,

35:30.940 --> 35:35.940
 then we're not going to find a useful rule

35:35.940 --> 35:37.940
 because there isn't one.

35:37.940 --> 35:40.940
 So the extreme of having a rule

35:40.940 --> 35:42.940
 is like knowing Newton's law,

35:42.940 --> 35:45.940
 if you hit a ball and it moves.

35:45.940 --> 35:48.940
 So that's where you had laws of physics.

35:48.940 --> 35:53.940
 Newton and Einstein and other great people

35:53.940 --> 35:56.940
 have found those laws

35:56.940 --> 36:03.940
 and laws of the distribution of oil

36:03.940 --> 36:06.940
 in an underground thing.

36:06.940 --> 36:11.940
 So engineers, petroleum engineers,

36:11.940 --> 36:17.940
 understand how oil will sit in an underground basin.

36:17.940 --> 36:20.940
 So there were rules.

36:20.940 --> 36:25.940
 Now the new idea of artificial intelligence is

36:25.940 --> 36:27.940
 to find the rules.

36:27.940 --> 36:29.940
 Instead of figuring out the rules

36:29.940 --> 36:32.940
 with help from Newton or Einstein,

36:32.940 --> 36:35.940
 the computer is looking for the rules.

36:35.940 --> 36:37.940
 So that's another step.

36:37.940 --> 36:39.940
 But if there are no rules at all

36:39.940 --> 36:41.940
 that the computer could find,

36:41.940 --> 36:43.940
 if it's totally random data,

36:43.940 --> 36:45.940
 well, you've got nothing.

36:45.940 --> 36:48.940
 You've got no science to discover.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.940
 It's automated search for the underlying rules.

36:51.940 --> 36:54.940
 Yeah, search for the rules, yeah, exactly.

36:54.940 --> 36:57.940
 And there will be a lot of random parts.

36:57.940 --> 36:59.940
 I mean, I'm not knocking random

36:59.940 --> 37:02.940
 because that's there.

37:02.940 --> 37:06.940
 There's a lot of randomness built in,

37:06.940 --> 37:10.940
 but there's got to be some basic structure.

37:10.940 --> 37:12.940
 There's got to be some signal.

37:12.940 --> 37:16.940
 If it's all noise, then you're not going to get anywhere.

37:16.940 --> 37:18.940
 Well, this world around us

37:18.940 --> 37:22.940
 does seem to always have a signal of some kind

37:22.940 --> 37:24.940
 to be discovered.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.940
 Right, that's it.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.940
 So what excites you more?

37:29.940 --> 37:32.940
 We just talked about a little bit of application.

37:32.940 --> 37:34.940
 What excites you more, theory

37:34.940 --> 37:37.940
 or the application of mathematics?

37:37.940 --> 37:40.940
 Well, for myself,

37:40.940 --> 37:43.940
 I'm probably a theory person.

37:43.940 --> 37:48.940
 I'm speaking here pretty freely about applications,

37:48.940 --> 37:52.940
 but I'm not the person who really...

37:52.940 --> 37:56.940
 I'm not a physicist or a chemist or a neuroscientist.

37:56.940 --> 38:02.940
 So for myself, I like the structure

38:02.940 --> 38:05.940
 and the flat subspaces

38:05.940 --> 38:11.940
 and the relation of matrices, columns to rows.

38:11.940 --> 38:16.940
 That's my part in the spectrum.

38:16.940 --> 38:21.940
 So really, science is a big spectrum of people

38:21.940 --> 38:25.940
 from asking practical questions and answering them

38:25.940 --> 38:27.940
 using some math,

38:27.940 --> 38:32.940
 then some math guys like myself who are in the middle of it,

38:32.940 --> 38:39.940
 and then the geniuses of math and physics and chemistry

38:39.940 --> 38:42.940
 who are finding fundamental rules

38:42.940 --> 38:49.940
 and doing really understanding nature.

38:49.940 --> 38:51.940
 That's incredible.

38:51.940 --> 38:54.940
 At its lowest, simplest level,

38:54.940 --> 38:58.940
 maybe just a quick and broad strokes from your perspective.

38:58.940 --> 39:04.940
 Where does linear algebra sit as a subfield of mathematics?

39:04.940 --> 39:09.940
 What are the various subfields that you think about

39:09.940 --> 39:11.940
 in relation to linear algebra?

39:11.940 --> 39:17.940
 So the big fields of math are algebra as a whole

39:17.940 --> 39:20.940
 and problems like calculus and differential equations.

39:20.940 --> 39:23.940
 So that's a second quite different field

39:23.940 --> 39:25.940
 than maybe geometry.

39:25.940 --> 39:29.940
 It deserves to be thought of as a different field

39:29.940 --> 39:34.940
 to understand the geometry of high dimensional surfaces.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.940
 So I think...

39:36.940 --> 39:39.940
 Am I allowed to say this here?

39:39.940 --> 39:45.940
 This is where personal view comes in.

39:45.940 --> 39:51.940
 I think we're thinking about undergraduate math,

39:51.940 --> 39:53.940
 what millions of students study.

39:53.940 --> 40:00.940
 I think we overdo the calculus at the cost of the algebra,

40:00.940 --> 40:02.940
 at the cost of linear.

40:02.940 --> 40:04.940
 See if this dog titled calculus versus linear algebra.

40:04.940 --> 40:06.940
 That's right.

40:06.940 --> 40:09.940
 And you say that linear algebra wins.

40:09.940 --> 40:13.940
 Can you dig into that a little bit?

40:13.940 --> 40:16.940
 Why does linear algebra win?

40:16.940 --> 40:17.940
 Right.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.940
 Well, okay.

40:19.940 --> 40:22.940
 The viewer is going to think this guy is biased.

40:22.940 --> 40:24.940
 Not true.

40:24.940 --> 40:27.940
 I'm just telling the truth as it is.

40:27.940 --> 40:31.940
 So I feel linear algebra is just a nice part of math

40:31.940 --> 40:34.940
 that people can get the idea of.

40:34.940 --> 40:37.940
 They understand something that's a little bit abstract,

40:37.940 --> 40:41.940
 because once you get to 10 or 100 dimensions,

40:41.940 --> 40:44.940
 and very, very, very useful.

40:44.940 --> 40:47.940
 That's what's happened in my lifetime,

40:47.940 --> 40:52.940
 is the importance of data,

40:52.940 --> 40:54.940
 which does come in matrix form.

40:54.940 --> 40:56.940
 So it's really set up for algebra.

40:56.940 --> 40:58.940
 It's not set up for differential equation.

40:58.940 --> 41:03.940
 And let me fairly add probability.

41:03.940 --> 41:05.940
 This is a probability.

41:05.940 --> 41:08.940
 And statistics have become very, very important.

41:08.940 --> 41:10.940
 I've also jumped forward.

41:10.940 --> 41:13.940
 And that's different from linear algebra.

41:13.940 --> 41:14.940
 Quite different.

41:14.940 --> 41:19.940
 So now we really have three major areas to me.

41:19.940 --> 41:25.940
 Calculus, linear algebra, matrices,

41:25.940 --> 41:28.940
 and probability statistics.

41:28.940 --> 41:33.940
 And they all deserve an important place.

41:33.940 --> 41:40.940
 And calculus has traditionally had a lion's share of the time.

41:40.940 --> 41:41.940
 A disproportionate share.

41:41.940 --> 41:43.940
 Thank you. Disproportionate.

41:43.940 --> 41:45.940
 That's a good word.

41:45.940 --> 41:52.940
 Of the love and attention from the excited young minds.

41:52.940 --> 41:55.940
 I know it's hard to pick favorites,

41:55.940 --> 41:57.940
 but what is your favorite matrix?

41:57.940 --> 41:59.940
 My favorite matrix.

41:59.940 --> 42:00.940
 Okay.

42:00.940 --> 42:02.940
 So my favorite matrix is square.

42:02.940 --> 42:03.940
 I admit it.

42:03.940 --> 42:05.940
 It's a square bunch of numbers.

42:05.940 --> 42:09.940
 And it has twos running down the main diagonal.

42:09.940 --> 42:12.940
 And on the next diagonal,

42:12.940 --> 42:15.940
 so think of top left to bottom right,

42:15.940 --> 42:18.940
 twos down the middle of the matrix.

42:18.940 --> 42:21.940
 And minus ones just above those twos

42:21.940 --> 42:24.940
 and minus ones just below those twos.

42:24.940 --> 42:27.940
 And otherwise all zeros. So mostly zeros.

42:27.940 --> 42:32.940
 Just three nonzero diagonals coming down.

42:32.940 --> 42:33.940
 What is interesting about it?

42:33.940 --> 42:36.940
 Well, all the different ways it comes up.

42:36.940 --> 42:38.940
 You see it in engineering.

42:38.940 --> 42:43.940
 You see it as analogous in calculus to second derivative.

42:43.940 --> 42:46.940
 So calculus learns about taking the derivative,

42:46.940 --> 42:50.940
 figuring out how fast something's changing.

42:50.940 --> 42:52.940
 But second derivative.

42:52.940 --> 42:55.940
 Now that's also important.

42:55.940 --> 42:58.940
 That's how fast the change is changing.

42:58.940 --> 43:01.940
 How fast the graph is bending.

43:01.940 --> 43:05.940
 How fast it's curving.

43:05.940 --> 43:11.940
 And Einstein showed that that's fundamental to understand space.

43:11.940 --> 43:16.940
 So second derivatives should have a bigger place in calculus.

43:16.940 --> 43:23.940
 Second, my matrices which are like the linear algebra

43:23.940 --> 43:29.940
 version of second derivatives are neat in linear algebra.

43:29.940 --> 43:30.940
 Yeah.

43:30.940 --> 43:32.940
 Just everything comes out right with those guys.

43:32.940 --> 43:34.940
 Beautiful.

43:34.940 --> 43:37.940
 What did you learn about the process of learning

43:37.940 --> 43:42.940
 by having taught so many students math over the years?

43:42.940 --> 43:49.940
 Oh, that is hard. I'll have to admit here that I'm not really

43:49.940 --> 43:55.940
 a good teacher because I don't get into the exam part.

43:55.940 --> 43:58.940
 The exam is the part of my life that I don't like.

43:58.940 --> 44:03.940
 And grading them and giving the students A or B or whatever.

44:03.940 --> 44:07.940
 I do it because I'm supposed to do it.

44:07.940 --> 44:11.940
 But I tell the class at the beginning.

44:11.940 --> 44:14.940
 I don't know if they believe me. Probably they don't.

44:14.940 --> 44:17.940
 I tell the class, I'm here to teach you.

44:17.940 --> 44:21.940
 I'm here to teach you math and not to grade you.

44:21.940 --> 44:27.940
 But they're thinking, OK, this guy, is he going to give me

44:27.940 --> 44:28.940
 an A minus?

44:28.940 --> 44:30.940
 Is he going to give me a B plus?

44:30.940 --> 44:33.940
 What did you learn about the process of learning?

44:33.940 --> 44:34.940
 Of learning.

44:34.940 --> 44:35.940
 Yeah.

44:35.940 --> 44:40.940
 Well, maybe to give you a legitimate answer about learning,

44:40.940 --> 44:44.940
 I should have paid more attention to the assessment,

44:44.940 --> 44:46.940
 the evaluation part at the end.

44:46.940 --> 44:49.940
 But I like the teaching part at the start.

44:49.940 --> 44:53.940
 That's the sexy part, to tell somebody for the first time

44:53.940 --> 44:55.940
 about a matrix. Wow.

44:55.940 --> 45:01.940
 Are there moments, so you are teaching a concept,

45:01.940 --> 45:04.940
 are there moments of learning that you just see

45:04.940 --> 45:05.940
 in the students eyes?

45:05.940 --> 45:07.940
 You don't need to look at the grades.

45:07.940 --> 45:10.940
 You see in their eyes that you hook them,

45:10.940 --> 45:17.940
 that you connect with them in a way where they fall in love

45:17.940 --> 45:20.940
 with this beautiful world of math.

45:20.940 --> 45:23.940
 They see that it's got some beauty there.

45:23.940 --> 45:27.940
 Or conversely, that they give up at that point.

45:27.940 --> 45:28.940
 It's the opposite.

45:28.940 --> 45:31.940
 The darker say that math, I'm just not good at math.

45:31.940 --> 45:33.940
 I don't want to walk away.

45:33.940 --> 45:37.940
 Maybe because of the approach in the past,

45:37.940 --> 45:40.940
 they were discouraged, but don't be discouraged.

45:40.940 --> 45:43.940
 It's too good to miss.

45:43.940 --> 45:44.940
 Yeah.

45:44.940 --> 45:49.940
 Well, if I'm teaching a big class, do I know when,

45:49.940 --> 45:51.940
 I think maybe I do.

45:51.940 --> 45:55.940
 Sort of, I mentioned at the very start,

45:55.940 --> 46:00.940
 the four fundamental subspaces and the structure

46:00.940 --> 46:03.940
 of the fundamental theorem of linear algebra.

46:03.940 --> 46:06.940
 The fundamental theorem of linear algebra.

46:06.940 --> 46:11.940
 That is the relation of those four subspaces.

46:11.940 --> 46:12.940
 Those four spaces.

46:12.940 --> 46:13.940
 Yeah.

46:13.940 --> 46:17.940
 So I think that I feel that the class gets it.

46:17.940 --> 46:18.940
 Let me see.

46:18.940 --> 46:19.940
 Yeah.

46:19.940 --> 46:22.940
 What advice do you have to a student just starting

46:22.940 --> 46:24.940
 their journey in mathematics today?

46:24.940 --> 46:26.940
 How do they get started?

46:26.940 --> 46:27.940
 No.

46:27.940 --> 46:29.940
 Yeah, that's hard.

46:29.940 --> 46:33.940
 Well, I hope you have a teacher,

46:33.940 --> 46:39.940
 a professor who is still enjoying what he's doing,

46:39.940 --> 46:40.940
 what he's teaching.

46:40.940 --> 46:43.940
 He's still looking for new ways to teach

46:43.940 --> 46:47.940
 and to understand math.

46:47.940 --> 46:52.940
 Because that's the pleasure to the moment when you see,

46:52.940 --> 46:54.940
 oh yeah, that works.

46:54.940 --> 46:57.940
 So it says about the material you study.

46:57.940 --> 47:01.940
 It's more about the source of the teacher

47:01.940 --> 47:03.940
 being full of passion.

47:03.940 --> 47:05.940
 Yeah, more about the fun.

47:05.940 --> 47:06.940
 The fun.

47:06.940 --> 47:09.940
 The moment of getting it.

47:09.940 --> 47:13.940
 But in terms of topics, linear algebra?

47:13.940 --> 47:16.940
 Well, that's my topic.

47:16.940 --> 47:20.940
 But oh, there's beautiful things in geometry to understand.

47:20.940 --> 47:26.940
 What's wonderful is that in the end, there's a pattern there.

47:26.940 --> 47:33.940
 There are rules that are followed in biology

47:33.940 --> 47:36.940
 as there are in every field.

47:36.940 --> 47:44.940
 You describe the life of a mathematician as 100% wonderful,

47:44.940 --> 47:46.940
 except for the grade stuff.

47:46.940 --> 47:48.940
 Except for grades.

47:48.940 --> 47:51.940
 Yeah, when you look back at your life,

47:51.940 --> 47:55.940
 what memories bring you the most joy and pride?

47:55.940 --> 47:58.940
 Well, that's a good question.

47:58.940 --> 48:05.940
 I certainly feel good when I maybe I'm giving a class in 1806.

48:05.940 --> 48:08.940
 That's MIT's linear algebra course that I started.

48:08.940 --> 48:12.940
 So there's a good feeling that, OK, I started this course.

48:12.940 --> 48:14.940
 A lot of students take it.

48:14.940 --> 48:16.940
 Quite a few like it.

48:16.940 --> 48:21.940
 Yeah, so I'm sort of happy when I feel

48:21.940 --> 48:26.940
 I'm helping make a connection between ideas and students,

48:26.940 --> 48:31.940
 between theory and the reader.

48:31.940 --> 48:33.940
 Yeah.

48:33.940 --> 48:40.940
 I get a lot of very nice messages from people who've watched the videos

48:40.940 --> 48:42.940
 and it's inspiring.

48:42.940 --> 48:46.940
 I'll maybe take this chance to say thank you.

48:46.940 --> 48:50.940
 Well, there's millions of students who you've taught

48:50.940 --> 48:53.940
 and I am grateful to be one of them.

48:53.940 --> 48:55.940
 So Gilbert, thank you so much.

48:55.940 --> 48:56.940
 It's been an honor.

48:56.940 --> 48:57.940
 Thank you for talking today.

48:57.940 --> 48:58.940
 It was a pleasure.

48:58.940 --> 48:59.940

 Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined,

49:37.940 --> 49:40.940
 irreverent, and original manner possible.
