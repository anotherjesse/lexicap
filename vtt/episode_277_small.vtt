00:00.000 --> 00:02.620
 If you get into the sauna the way I just described,

00:02.620 --> 00:05.200
 not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes,

00:05.200 --> 00:07.440
 twice a week or three times per week,

00:07.440 --> 00:09.440
 you reduce the likelihood of dying

00:09.440 --> 00:12.400
 of a cardiovascular event by 27%.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.680
 If you do it four or more times per week,

00:14.680 --> 00:17.960
 you reduce the probability of dying by 50%.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.800
 Is there any scientific evidence

00:19.800 --> 00:22.440
 that being naked is beneficial in the sauna?

00:22.440 --> 00:25.600
 Well, in certain contexts, it leads to childbirth.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.560
 Okay, well, I'll have to read up on that.

00:27.560 --> 00:32.520
 I think Dorothy Parker said the cure for boredom is curiosity.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.400
 There is no cure for curiosity.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.360
 The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman,

00:39.360 --> 00:41.800
 his third time on this podcast.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.280
 He's a brilliant neuroscientist at Stanford University

00:45.280 --> 00:48.160
 and the host of one of the best,

00:49.480 --> 00:51.240
 the best, if you ask me,

00:51.240 --> 00:53.240
 Health and Science Podcast in the world

00:53.240 --> 00:55.600
 called Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.840
 Check him out on Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.920
 Most importantly, Andrew is a great human being

01:01.920 --> 01:05.320
 and has quickly become a great friend.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.400
 This is Alex Friedman podcast.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.520
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:09.520 --> 01:10.800
 in the description.

01:10.800 --> 01:14.800
 And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.600
 We meet again, my friend.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.760
 We should talk on each other's podcast once a year.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.520
 I think we should make a deal.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.040
 I was just talking to the guys.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.560
 This is a show called Louie, I don't know if you know it.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.680
 And yeah, with Louie CK.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.320
 And there's this thing called Bang Bang,

01:30.320 --> 01:32.240
 which people are probably watching know exactly

01:32.240 --> 01:33.520
 what I'm talking about.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.520
 It's this worst possible thing you can do

01:35.520 --> 01:39.000
 in terms of meals, which is you go to a restaurant,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.480
 do a full meal, and then you go to another restaurant

01:42.480 --> 01:43.320
 and do a full meal.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.520
 And you pat me, you, exactly.

01:46.520 --> 01:51.040
 So they go, Mexican Italian, sushi pizza, barbecue,

01:51.040 --> 01:52.960
 I hopped that, that one is disgusting.

01:52.960 --> 01:57.840
 This kind of thing reminds me of the joy of food.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.680
 Last time we were hanging out,

01:59.680 --> 02:01.880
 we went to see Joe Dew comedy,

02:01.880 --> 02:04.640
 and then we went to eat Russian food.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.440
 And it was a particularly fun experience

02:08.440 --> 02:10.840
 to go to a Russian restaurant.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.320
 I was the only person there that didn't speak Russian.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.200
 And eat Russian food with you.

02:16.200 --> 02:20.440
 And because I felt walking in, they trusted you.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.800
 They didn't trust me.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.760
 Yeah, the funny thing about the people there,

02:24.760 --> 02:26.600
 they were talking to you in Russian.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.120
 And then they refused to sort of switch to English,

02:29.120 --> 02:31.240
 even though they understood you speak no Russian.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.040
 This is Russian house in Austin, by the way.

02:34.040 --> 02:37.160
 Anyway, by way of question, what's the worst

02:37.160 --> 02:40.120
 or the best depending on your perspective, cheat meal?

02:40.120 --> 02:41.520
 Let's call it a picking out meal,

02:41.520 --> 02:45.200
 but it could be a cheat meal that you've ever had

02:45.200 --> 02:48.600
 or you want to have that's like on the bucket list

02:48.600 --> 02:49.880
 or something that's in the past,

02:49.880 --> 02:52.280
 like where you did something like a bang bang,

02:52.280 --> 02:55.160
 which is like, you're talking about multiple thousands

02:55.160 --> 02:59.040
 of calories that you just feel horrible about yourself,

02:59.040 --> 03:01.480
 but you still keep eating because it's delicious,

03:01.480 --> 03:05.920
 but also great company, something about the atmosphere

03:05.920 --> 03:09.320
 is just right, screw the diet, screw all the things

03:09.320 --> 03:12.400
 you know, like you should be doing,

03:12.400 --> 03:14.440
 but just throw it all out the window.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.880
 I've done that, several times.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.080
 Yeah, I don't do this anymore,

03:18.080 --> 03:20.520
 but the entire time I was a postdoc,

03:20.520 --> 03:21.920
 so five years and the entire time

03:21.920 --> 03:24.400
 I was a pre tenured professor, so five years.

03:24.400 --> 03:29.600
 So I basically followed the Tim Ferriss slow carb diet,

03:29.600 --> 03:32.880
 which is people can look it up, but it works really well.

03:32.880 --> 03:37.400
 It was basically some good animal proteins,

03:37.400 --> 03:38.560
 fish and meat and things like that.

03:38.560 --> 03:39.400
 Like slow carb.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.520
 Because slow carb is like low glycemic stuff,

03:41.520 --> 03:44.400
 is mostly lentils and beans and things and vegetables.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.880
 No dairy, no, anyway.

03:47.880 --> 03:48.720
 But then one day.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.560
 No pasta in there?

03:49.560 --> 03:50.400
 Sorry to interrupt.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.240
 No pasta.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.600
 So it wasn't low carb, but it was low glycemic carb.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.320
 And I did that and it worked terrifically well

03:55.320 --> 03:56.360
 just for energy levels,

03:56.360 --> 03:57.440
 because I want to be able to train and work.

03:57.440 --> 04:02.440
 And then one day a week, you're supposed to go full cheat day.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.440
 And so I would do what used to be 12 hours,

04:05.440 --> 04:07.440
 but then it became 24,

04:07.440 --> 04:09.840
 start to redefine what the day is.

04:09.840 --> 04:13.840
 And that was when Costello was pretty young

04:13.840 --> 04:14.960
 and we would do it together.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.120
 So I would get pizzas and croissants and donuts

04:18.120 --> 04:20.080
 and I would just do the full thing.

04:20.080 --> 04:21.680
 And by the end of the day,

04:21.680 --> 04:24.040
 you don't want to look at an item of food.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.560
 You're just repulsed by food.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.920
 The only modification I made was the next day

04:27.920 --> 04:29.400
 I would fast completely,

04:29.400 --> 04:32.400
 just to avoid the gastric distress of eating anything.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.240
 And so I would do them on Sundays

04:34.240 --> 04:35.560
 and then Mondays I'd fast all day.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.640
 And then by Tuesday, I felt pretty good again.

04:37.640 --> 04:38.760
 But Sunday and Monday,

04:38.760 --> 04:42.720
 or you just feel like you're sliding down the slope

04:42.720 --> 04:44.920
 of just blood sugar disaster.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.240
 A terrible idea or a good idea.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.320
 You know, at the time, I enjoyed it.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.440
 I love donuts, croissants, all that kind of stuff.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.600
 What's interesting is after stopping that whole protocol,

04:53.600 --> 04:54.960
 now I just try and eat well each day.

04:54.960 --> 04:55.800
 Protocol?

04:55.800 --> 04:56.720
 It's really a protocol.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.440
 Now I basically, I do a pseudo intermittent fasting.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.600
 I'm not really strict,

05:00.600 --> 05:02.360
 but I'll start eating around 11,

05:02.360 --> 05:03.440
 eat my first meal around 11.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.520
 I usually train in the morning,

05:04.520 --> 05:06.680
 eat my last bite of food somewhere around eight or nine.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.760
 And I'm not super strict.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.600
 I might have some berries or something late at night.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.040
 Three meals, two meals?

05:11.040 --> 05:13.120
 Two, two meals.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.320
 And then maybe a little bit of snacking on some nuts

05:15.320 --> 05:16.160
 or something in the middle.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.080
 Ever fast?

05:17.080 --> 05:17.920
 24 hours?

05:17.920 --> 05:18.920
 Never done long fast,

05:18.920 --> 05:20.840
 except when I was doing the cheat days.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.560
 And then, and actually there are a couple of different ways

05:24.560 --> 05:25.840
 to do cheat days that were fun.

05:25.840 --> 05:26.960
 Like if you were in a new city,

05:26.960 --> 05:30.560
 you could try all the restaurants that you wanted.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.080
 Yeah, and I think Tim and our mutual friend,

05:33.080 --> 05:34.480
 John Rominello did a,

05:34.480 --> 05:36.800
 I think it was like a cheat day marathon where they did,

05:36.800 --> 05:38.400
 you know, a marathon's 26.3 miles.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.720
 They went to 26.3 different locations in New York.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.720
 They put it on a map.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.560
 And I never took it to that extreme, but...

05:45.560 --> 05:46.400
 Wait, wait, wait.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.520
 Over how many days?

05:47.520 --> 05:48.920
 One day, that was their cheat day.

05:48.920 --> 05:49.760
 What?

05:49.760 --> 05:51.040
 Just because they were, you know...

05:51.040 --> 05:53.040
 Just a little bit of something at each place?

05:53.040 --> 05:54.360
 Yeah, exactly.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.480
 I mean, there are things that guys do in their 30s

05:56.480 --> 05:58.080
 that you just shouldn't do in your 40s.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.680
 I can say that because I'm in my 40s.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.040
 And now I just try and eat well most days.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.240
 And what's interesting is about 12 to 14 months ago,

06:05.240 --> 06:08.160
 I completely lost all appetite for sweets.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.000
 I don't know what happened.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.040
 I still love savory food.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.360
 So meat and butter and cheese.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.240
 And I love vegetables too.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.920
 I love fruit also, but lost all appetite.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.800
 So if you put a donut in front of me or ice cream

06:18.800 --> 06:20.320
 or something like that, I just...

06:20.320 --> 06:22.160
 It's almost aversive to me.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.360
 And I don't know what happened.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.200
 I don't know what changed.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.760
 It's probably a scientific explanation.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.600
 Sure.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.440
 It says to do maybe...

06:27.440 --> 06:28.280
 Neuron moss.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.120
 Dementia.

06:29.120 --> 06:29.960
 Yeah.

06:29.960 --> 06:34.960
 The sugar, the desire for that rush maybe is gone

06:35.840 --> 06:37.440
 from your soul.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.960
 What was the most delicious things?

06:38.960 --> 06:42.280
 Croissant, donuts, what is there a thing that...

06:42.280 --> 06:44.760
 There's a place in Portland.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.800
 I don't know if it's still open called Little Teas Bakery.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.800
 And they have croissants that easily rival

06:50.800 --> 06:52.200
 the croissants in Paris.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.680
 People make a lot of the pastry in Paris,

06:54.680 --> 06:56.120
 but it's really the bread in Paris.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.040
 That's amazing.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.480
 We lived there when I was a kid.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.760
 And we did a sabbatical there.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.760
 And there they do the baguette morning bake

07:01.760 --> 07:02.920
 and afternoon bake.

07:02.920 --> 07:07.440
 And there's nothing like the bread in Paris or the people.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.920
 And but if you're in the Pacific Northwest,

07:10.920 --> 07:13.000
 you can find amazing croissants there.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.040
 What do you do with the croissant?

07:14.040 --> 07:15.280
 What do you do with the bread?

07:15.280 --> 07:16.440
 Butter or is it just...

07:16.440 --> 07:17.560
 I actually used to...

07:17.560 --> 07:18.400
 I don't eat them anymore.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.760
 I don't have much of an appetite for them

07:19.760 --> 07:20.840
 even though they're not a sweet food.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.000
 But I'm always putting butter on the croissant.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.360
 Butter on the butter croissant.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.200
 No jam.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.480
 I would never adulterate my croissant.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.360
 I have to actually be honest about this

07:30.360 --> 07:31.600
 because people talk about steak

07:31.600 --> 07:34.440
 and they talk about bread with the butter.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.800
 I feel like butter is cheating.

07:35.800 --> 07:40.080
 I feel like you're disrespecting the fundamental food

07:40.080 --> 07:41.320
 by adding butter.

07:41.320 --> 07:46.320
 Because butter, it's like an elite version of ketchup.

07:47.680 --> 07:48.520
 You're...

07:48.520 --> 07:49.520
 Well, there we diverge because for me,

07:49.520 --> 07:52.120
 bread is just a vehicle for butter.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.760
 A cracker is just a vehicle for cheese.

07:56.760 --> 07:57.880
 Oh, so that's just...

07:57.880 --> 07:59.920
 The cracker and the bread is just texture.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.160
 It's just that people look at you funny

08:01.160 --> 08:03.240
 if you just eat the butter straight,

08:03.240 --> 08:04.360
 which occasionally I do.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.200
 I got it.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.880
 So I put a little piece of bread underneath it,

08:07.880 --> 08:10.240
 not because I'm low carb, strictly low carb,

08:10.240 --> 08:13.000
 but just because otherwise you get some funny looks.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.120
 That's like pasta is a vehicle for pasta sauce.

08:17.120 --> 08:20.640
 It's interesting, but like Indian non bread,

08:20.640 --> 08:23.400
 you have the bread.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.440
 I've had a lot of soul searching

08:25.440 --> 08:28.800
 on which part of Indian brings me so much joy.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.800
 Is it the bread or is it all the sauces

08:30.800 --> 08:31.680
 that come with the bread?

08:31.680 --> 08:32.840
 Well, there we diverge again

08:32.840 --> 08:35.160
 because for whatever reason,

08:35.160 --> 08:38.040
 and no disrespect to anyone, but Indian food

08:38.040 --> 08:39.120
 doesn't appeal to me.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.320
 Well, you're a lucky man

08:40.320 --> 08:43.160
 because the number of calories in that food,

08:43.160 --> 08:44.800
 it sneaks like non bread.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.120
 I don't know how non bread is made,

08:46.120 --> 08:49.320
 but I think it's just soaked in oil

08:49.320 --> 08:51.800
 and it just very intensely.

08:51.800 --> 08:55.400
 Like the density of calories is very, very high.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.720
 For me, barbecue, I would say is probably the...

08:58.720 --> 08:59.560
 That's good.

08:59.560 --> 09:02.960
 Anytime I'm in Austin, I start thinking about barbecue.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.360
 I do love, you know, I do love meat.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.800
 My dad's Argentine, I mean, I love steak, I love meat.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.480
 I mean, Argentina chorizo sausage

09:09.480 --> 09:12.600
 is an appetizer before you have steak.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.720
 It's meat on top of meat.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.000
 And it's not just the men, right?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.440
 You see women, sometimes very petite women

09:18.440 --> 09:22.600
 eating steaks that are bigger than their skull size.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.360
 Slowly, they eat very slowly there

09:24.360 --> 09:26.280
 and they all eat dessert too, which is interesting.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.920
 And they generally do the sort of one meal per day.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.560
 They do that kind of reflexively.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.760
 That's how I think about it

09:31.760 --> 09:32.960
 because I often eat one meal a day,

09:32.960 --> 09:34.240
 especially when I'm traveling.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.960
 It feels like a cheap meal

09:35.960 --> 09:38.840
 because it allows, it gives you a bit of more freedom

09:38.840 --> 09:42.520
 to just lose yourself in the quantity of the food.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.120
 I did the three day fast

09:44.120 --> 09:46.200
 and I ate chicken breast,

09:46.200 --> 09:48.000
 like literally chicken breast with nothing else,

09:48.000 --> 09:49.960
 just grilled, and it was the most delicious

09:49.960 --> 09:51.360
 piece of meat I've ever eaten.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.640
 And that gives you, the problem is when you fast

09:54.640 --> 09:56.480
 the three days, you really can't pig out.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.600
 You really shouldn't.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.560
 Well, your stomach will shrink inside already.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.840
 Your gut microbiome is almost completely depleted

10:01.840 --> 10:02.880
 by fasting.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.440
 A lot of people think, oh, cleanses and fasts

10:04.440 --> 10:05.840
 are great for the microbiome.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.680
 They quash your microbiome.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.720
 However, when you start eating again,

10:09.720 --> 10:11.680
 the microbiome comes back better

10:11.680 --> 10:13.160
 than it was before you're fast.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.040
 For people who don't know,

10:14.040 --> 10:15.440
 Sergey and Todd are on the call.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.000
 They're kind of pulling stuff up.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.600
 They just pulled up felps with,

10:19.600 --> 10:21.720
 I forget how many calories, just eating 10,000.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.560
 You know what's interesting?

10:22.560 --> 10:24.840
 There's some cool physiology around this.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.800
 The reason he needed to eat so much

10:26.800 --> 10:30.080
 is not that he was burning that many calories

10:30.080 --> 10:31.360
 in pure movement.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.360
 It's that when you do exercise in water,

10:33.360 --> 10:34.720
 even if it's warm water,

10:34.720 --> 10:36.560
 the heat transfer in water is greater.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.240
 So you burn far more calories.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.760
 And again here, I'm admittedly lifting that from knowledge

10:41.760 --> 10:43.760
 that was passed on to me by Tim Ferriss that I didn't.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.160
 So, but I checked it out and it's absolutely true.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.000
 So if you exercise in water,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.600
 even if it's not really cold water,

10:49.600 --> 10:50.720
 your caloric needs go way up,

10:50.720 --> 10:52.320
 which is why you get out of the pool

10:52.320 --> 10:53.680
 and you're often really hungry.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.080
 And for fans of the Human Lab podcast,

10:56.080 --> 10:59.160
 and if you're not a fan, what do you do in your life?

10:59.160 --> 11:02.040
 You would probably chuckle at the fact

11:02.040 --> 11:04.680
 that Andrew just cited his sources,

11:04.680 --> 11:05.800
 even on that statement.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.040
 Because you're so good at,

11:08.040 --> 11:09.320
 I don't know how your memory works,

11:09.320 --> 11:12.680
 but the only person whose memory is better

11:12.680 --> 11:14.360
 than Joe Rogan is yours.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.400
 But my colleagues joke,

11:17.400 --> 11:20.040
 PubMed sort of scrolls through my mind.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.520
 Also in science, as you know,

11:22.520 --> 11:24.920
 attribution is so baked into what we do.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.400
 And I think that it's interesting,

11:27.400 --> 11:29.720
 because now spending a lot of time on social media,

11:29.720 --> 11:31.720
 attribution is not as common.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.720
 And, but in academia,

11:33.720 --> 11:34.840
 you learn really early on

11:34.840 --> 11:37.160
 that if you give a talk about your data

11:37.160 --> 11:39.160
 and you cite all these amazing sources,

11:39.160 --> 11:42.280
 all it does is make you look better, right?

11:42.280 --> 11:44.440
 Whereas in social media and elsewhere,

11:44.440 --> 11:45.480
 in the business sector,

11:45.480 --> 11:46.920
 it's almost like citing other people,

11:46.920 --> 11:48.360
 people feel as if it's going to take away

11:48.360 --> 11:49.160
 some of the credit.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.760
 All it does is place you in the company

11:50.760 --> 11:52.360
 of people that do really nice work.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.160
 So I have tremendous,

11:53.160 --> 11:55.560
 and I have genuine and tremendous respect for Tim.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.880
 He's been about 10 years ahead on a huge number

11:57.880 --> 11:59.880
 of health related things and other things,

11:59.880 --> 12:01.240
 an extremely kind person,

12:01.240 --> 12:02.200
 very thoughtful person.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.880
 So it's also just a pleasure

12:03.880 --> 12:05.640
 to shine light on other people.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.040
 Yeah, yeah.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.320
 Well, I actually, to push back,

12:07.800 --> 12:09.800
 I know there's a culture of,

12:09.800 --> 12:13.640
 if you write a paper standing on the shoulders of giants,

12:13.640 --> 12:14.520
 it's a powerful thing.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.120
 But there's also a culture of not giving credit

12:19.160 --> 12:21.240
 to the strongest idea in your paper

12:21.240 --> 12:22.760
 and instead say it's kind of,

12:22.760 --> 12:24.200
 or imply that it's original.

12:24.200 --> 12:28.040
 There is a culture of kind of not celebrating others.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.400
 I think people get most competitive

12:31.400 --> 12:32.520
 in all walks of life,

12:33.080 --> 12:34.440
 but especially in science,

12:34.440 --> 12:36.520
 when they're as the closer they get

12:36.520 --> 12:38.120
 in the exact kind of thing they work on.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.840
 And so there's this dance,

12:40.840 --> 12:42.440
 you know, there's a few researchers

12:43.160 --> 12:44.760
 in each of the individual little things

12:44.760 --> 12:45.480
 that you work on.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.880
 If you're studying a particular kind of ant,

12:47.880 --> 12:49.240
 you know that other asshole

12:49.960 --> 12:52.440
 that also is studying that particular ant.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.040
 And then you're not going to often give credit

12:56.040 --> 12:57.240
 for the brilliant ideas

12:57.240 --> 12:59.560
 that that other researcher is doing.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.720
 And I think one of the things you've discovered

13:01.720 --> 13:03.480
 and just as part of your nature,

13:03.480 --> 13:06.280
 and which is why it's really great

13:06.280 --> 13:08.280
 that you have an audience

13:08.280 --> 13:09.640
 and you inspire others to do the same

13:09.640 --> 13:12.520
 is you celebrate that other ant study here.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.600
 It's great and everybody wins.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.120
 It raises all boats.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.840
 But that initial instinct to be like,

13:19.640 --> 13:20.920
 what is it in Borat?

13:20.920 --> 13:24.680
 Like my neighbor, my neighbor gets a toaster.

13:24.680 --> 13:25.960
 I get a bigger toaster.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.120
 That mindset to, you know,

13:28.120 --> 13:30.200
 it's not that I'm not competitive

13:30.200 --> 13:31.160
 in certain domains,

13:31.160 --> 13:33.640
 but yeah, I get great pleasure

13:33.640 --> 13:37.000
 from sharing things that I find.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.400
 And I think that, you know,

13:39.400 --> 13:40.200
 at the end of the day,

13:41.400 --> 13:42.840
 as strong as your community,

13:43.560 --> 13:45.800
 and you can build a wonderful community

13:45.800 --> 13:48.600
 just by pointing out things that you love.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.720
 Like these are all just loves.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.480
 I see a paper and I love it.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.760
 Only rarely do I think,

13:52.760 --> 13:53.960
 oh, I wish we had done that.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.160
 I usually think fantastic.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.600
 Now I can just focus on something else

13:56.600 --> 13:58.040
 because they checked off that box.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.280
 And by the way, you mentioned PubMed and Barbecue.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.560
 I should mention that I got a chance

14:03.560 --> 14:05.320
 to hang out with Rick Rubin.

14:05.320 --> 14:05.960
 Thanks to you.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.800
 He's a friend of yours and you made the connection.

14:07.800 --> 14:11.000
 That was a huge gift to my spirit, I guess.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.080
 He's a truly, truly special human being.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.480
 And there's a lot I could say

14:15.480 --> 14:17.320
 about why he's a special human being.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.560
 I'd love to learn how you met him,

14:19.560 --> 14:22.040
 but I should also just mention on the PubMed thing,

14:23.400 --> 14:25.560
 it was so interesting talking to him about music.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.840
 And both on the podcast and privately,

14:30.840 --> 14:32.680
 and just listening to music together,

14:32.680 --> 14:35.160
 because when you mention a song,

14:36.120 --> 14:38.840
 he does this thing where he like closes his eyes

14:39.880 --> 14:42.280
 and he finds that song in the album

14:42.280 --> 14:43.320
 that we're talking about.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.800
 And he steps through the album.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.400
 You could see the brain stepping through individual songs

14:49.400 --> 14:51.000
 to find that song in the album.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
 And there's that kind of lookup process.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.560
 And then he puts himself mentally in that space of like,

14:56.280 --> 14:59.720
 okay, this is whatever the album is,

14:59.720 --> 15:01.400
 and not just the ones he produced,

15:01.400 --> 15:04.840
 but all of it, he's an encyclopedia of music.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.720
 And it's so interesting.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.280
 It also, the thing I really love about him,

15:10.280 --> 15:13.320
 something like a calmness that radiates from him,

15:13.320 --> 15:16.200
 that it's okay to close your eyes and place yourself

15:17.480 --> 15:19.320
 in the place where that album was recorded,

15:20.440 --> 15:24.360
 in the feeling of that album, and like that silence,

15:24.360 --> 15:26.440
 let's go there, let's go there together.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.520
 It's like Alice in Wonderland, and we'll go there together.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.080
 You do a good Rick Rubin, minus the beard.

15:31.080 --> 15:31.800
 Minus the beard.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.560
 His beard is epic, right?

15:33.560 --> 15:35.720
 You can't fake a beard like that, you know.

15:35.720 --> 15:36.520
 How'd you guys meet?

15:37.080 --> 15:41.880
 Yeah, well, Rick, I'm very blessed to consider a close friend.

15:41.880 --> 15:45.800
 And Rick and I got introduced through a common friend

15:45.800 --> 15:49.560
 during the pandemic, and we started doing some FaceTime together

15:49.560 --> 15:51.880
 and just talking about things related to science and health.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.720
 And I'm not a musician.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.880
 I have no musical ability or talent.

15:55.880 --> 15:58.040
 I have a good ability to memorize lyrics,

15:58.040 --> 16:00.200
 and I love lyrics, and I love poetry.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.600
 So I asked him a lot of questions about musicians

16:02.600 --> 16:05.320
 that I happened to love, that he's worked with and knows.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.720
 And so he would give me stories about musicians,

16:07.720 --> 16:10.040
 and I would talk to him about health.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.600
 And then eventually, we formed a friendship where we would talk

16:12.600 --> 16:14.680
 about any number of different topics in life.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.120
 And then we started spending time together in person

16:18.840 --> 16:20.440
 when he was in town or nearby.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.480
 And as you now know, Rick, in addition to all his incredible

16:27.480 --> 16:33.720
 accomplishments, has an incredible understanding of how to get

16:33.720 --> 16:36.520
 the brain and body into state, right?

16:36.520 --> 16:41.240
 And as you pointed out, he's willing to do the things that allow

16:41.240 --> 16:45.000
 him to help these incredible artists get into the best state

16:45.000 --> 16:46.120
 to do their craft.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.520
 And so if he needs to sit there and be quiet with his eyes closed

16:50.520 --> 16:54.200
 for a minute or two or more, he'll do that.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.960
 He has routines to allow himself to get into state.

16:57.960 --> 17:01.080
 And it's really inspired me to think about states of mind

17:01.080 --> 17:03.720
 as something that we'd all love to just flip the switch

17:03.720 --> 17:05.560
 and say, we're focused or we're creative.

17:05.560 --> 17:09.800
 But to actually ratchet through the challenging steps

17:09.800 --> 17:12.600
 in order to do that and to figure out what one needs to do

17:12.600 --> 17:16.280
 on a regular basis to get into a proper state.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.680
 It's not just going to come from a cup of coffee,

17:20.360 --> 17:22.520
 a lamp of a particular wavelength or something.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.840
 It's going to be those things, but it's also going to be

17:24.840 --> 17:28.360
 really teaching oneself how to get into proper state.

17:28.360 --> 17:29.960
 Yeah, you did an episode on hypnosis.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.440
 Do you think it's a kind of self hypnosis?

17:32.440 --> 17:33.240
 Yes, I do.

17:33.240 --> 17:39.160
 Because hypnosis is a you limit the context, you're very alert

17:39.720 --> 17:40.680
 and you're very calm.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.200
 And he has a number of these different practices.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.480
 And so we would talk about those.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.360
 And then we also have enjoyed a lot of discussions

17:48.360 --> 17:50.120
 about deep neuroscience.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.600
 In fact, I introduced Rick to a friend of mine

17:52.600 --> 17:54.760
 who's a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist,

17:54.760 --> 17:56.120
 and they've become friendly.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.320
 You know, Rick is one of these people

17:57.320 --> 18:00.520
 that he sort of defies definition, incredibly kind,

18:00.520 --> 18:02.040
 incredibly private person too.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.880
 So, you know, I'm being respectful of that.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.400
 But and then, of course, he's a fan of your podcast.

18:07.400 --> 18:11.000
 And so when I learned that, I just made natural sense

18:11.000 --> 18:11.800
 to introduce you.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.640
 And I know he really enjoyed meeting you.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.320
 And we talk about you a lot.

18:15.320 --> 18:19.560
 And of course, in a positive light, I think his dedication

18:19.560 --> 18:21.720
 to getting into these states of mind

18:21.720 --> 18:23.800
 and his willingness to do that has completely

18:23.800 --> 18:26.200
 transformed my routines around life.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.520
 Like, for instance, before doing a very long podcast

18:28.520 --> 18:31.720
 recording, the solo ones, which often take me several hours

18:31.720 --> 18:35.160
 or more, six hours to record, sometimes more, sometimes less.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.320
 I realized that there's a certain brain state

18:37.320 --> 18:38.200
 associated with that.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.600
 So I have to really limit the kind of interactions

18:40.600 --> 18:42.360
 I have for the two hours before.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.560
 I actually walk and talk out loud through my neighborhood.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.800
 People think I'm crazy, but I live in a neighborhood

18:47.800 --> 18:50.840
 where there are a lot of crazy creatives anyway.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.960
 You're saying you're not crazy?

18:52.840 --> 18:57.880
 Well, at least not institutionally defined as crazy yet.

18:57.880 --> 19:00.680
 But, you know, getting into state of mind

19:00.680 --> 19:02.760
 is something that we'd all just imagine we flip the switch.

19:02.760 --> 19:05.080
 But Rick really convinced me, you have to do the work

19:05.080 --> 19:05.880
 to do the work.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.360
 Can you maybe linger on that, elucidate a little bit more

19:10.360 --> 19:12.760
 of your process of how you get in that space?

19:12.760 --> 19:13.880
 That's really interesting.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.960
 Because I have to admit, I do everything last minute

19:17.960 --> 19:19.160
 before podcasts.

19:19.160 --> 19:22.840
 I don't know, like, there's a lot of anxiety.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.320
 Because, like, whatever, if I have to pack,

19:25.320 --> 19:28.840
 if I have to set up stuff, you were luckily a few minutes,

19:28.840 --> 19:30.360
 you showed up a few minutes later.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.960
 Which, for an academic, is right on time.

19:31.960 --> 19:32.600
 Right on time.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.160
 But the stress is immense.

19:35.960 --> 19:39.720
 And on top of that, you look at, like, a situation

19:39.720 --> 19:43.960
 with Rick Rubin, I had to set up microphones in front of him.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.760
 And just that stress, the anxiety.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.200
 He knows a lot about microphones.

19:48.200 --> 19:50.040
 What did he say, which I really loved?

19:50.040 --> 19:54.840
 He's like, how close do you like the microphone to be?

19:56.520 --> 19:59.000
 That's a very Rick Rubin kind of thing, right?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.680
 That the details really matter.

20:01.480 --> 20:06.200
 The details really matter right down to your relationship

20:06.200 --> 20:07.480
 to the microphone, right?

20:07.480 --> 20:09.480
 Distance and whether or not it brings out the timbre

20:09.480 --> 20:09.880
 in your voice.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.040
 But of course, as he does, he produces music.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.920
 But he also said, like, you know, he is the professional.

20:15.720 --> 20:20.280
 He said, how close do you like it to be?

20:20.280 --> 20:22.840
 And he said it with the gentleness where I had,

20:22.840 --> 20:25.960
 like, an existential crisis where I don't know.

20:25.960 --> 20:31.320
 He gave me so much, like, wow, he made me feel like an artist.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.880
 That the microphone distance is a decision

20:35.880 --> 20:37.240
 you're supposed to make.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.240
 Well, I have to say, and this has actually come up

20:39.240 --> 20:41.320
 in some of our conversations about you.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.760
 I mean, you are an artist.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.960
 And actually, Joe Rogan, once I heard him talking

20:45.960 --> 20:47.960
 about podcasting and the fact that he's always

20:47.960 --> 20:50.360
 trying to get better at it, and he described podcasting

20:50.360 --> 20:52.440
 at one moment as an art, right?

20:52.440 --> 20:53.320
 And it is.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.480
 It's a certain medium of communication.

20:55.480 --> 20:59.240
 And there's a cadence and a rhythm that when it's working,

20:59.240 --> 21:01.720
 it really can facilitate the transfer of information.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.080
 And when it's not, it doesn't.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.560
 I mean, obviously, Joe, just being himself,

21:05.560 --> 21:08.680
 has tapped into that cadence that allows

21:08.680 --> 21:11.720
 and has made so many people excited to hear him talk.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.600
 Well, in his case, and in general, I think part of the art

21:15.320 --> 21:19.080
 is refusing the world as you get a bigger audience,

21:19.640 --> 21:20.920
 change who you are.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.520
 There's one quote that I've seen out there

21:22.520 --> 21:24.920
 where he says, you know, I'm like talking about himself.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.400
 He says, you know, I'm like the fish that got through the net.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.640
 There's no stage version of me, right?

21:29.640 --> 21:33.960
 How he is in person is how he is out in the world.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.280
 And of course, there's nuance to his life, right?

21:36.280 --> 21:39.480
 And his different relationships, of course.

21:39.480 --> 21:40.040
 But it's true.

21:40.040 --> 21:43.000
 I mean, we've had the great fortune of spending time

21:43.000 --> 21:45.720
 with him out away from the microphones, so to speak.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.320
 Joe is Joe.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.520
 So can you speak to that process?

21:50.520 --> 21:52.520
 You mentioned the walking and the talking to yourself

21:52.520 --> 21:53.320
 because that's fascinating.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.440
 Yeah, I try and do a couple of things.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.600
 First of all, when I was a kid, I had a little bit of a grunting tick.

22:01.400 --> 22:05.320
 When I was five or six, I would feel this build up of tension

22:05.320 --> 22:07.560
 in my throat and I would do this grunting tick.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.200
 If I get very tired, I start to do it still.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.640
 We actually know that this is related

22:11.640 --> 22:13.960
 to these basal ganglia circuits for go, no, go.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.040
 You've got an accelerator or a brake, basically,

22:16.040 --> 22:17.400
 in your neural circuitry.

22:17.400 --> 22:23.240
 And kids with Tourette's in OCD, the brake doesn't work quite as well.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.560
 And so one thing that happens is if I wake up in the morning

22:25.560 --> 22:28.920
 and especially if I'm well rested, well, if I'm not well rested,

22:28.920 --> 22:32.120
 I do a hypnosis or yoga nidra in order to recover my sleep

22:32.120 --> 22:32.920
 that works really well.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.880
 But then once I'm into the process of preparing the podcast,

22:36.600 --> 22:37.800
 I've already gone through my notes.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.920
 I know what I want to say more or less in a kind of general contour.

22:40.920 --> 22:45.400
 And then I take a walk and I try to, so no phone with me,

22:45.400 --> 22:49.800
 and I try to assess whether or not my energy is too high

22:49.800 --> 22:52.040
 or too low for podcasting.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.320
 Because when you podcast, as you know,

22:54.280 --> 22:55.720
 you have to punch out a lot of material,

22:55.720 --> 22:57.560
 but then there's times when you really need to slow down

22:57.560 --> 22:58.920
 and emphasize and articulate.

22:59.480 --> 23:03.480
 And so what I do, I've never revealed this,

23:04.040 --> 23:07.880
 what I do actually is I will recite the lyrics of songs

23:07.880 --> 23:12.360
 for about 10 minutes, songs I love, while I walk out loud.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.720
 It calms you and focuses you.

23:13.720 --> 23:14.440
 What does it do for you?

23:14.440 --> 23:19.640
 I think it gets my vocal cords warmed up and it also...

23:19.640 --> 23:21.000
 Do you sing or speak them?

23:21.000 --> 23:25.560
 I often sing them and fortunately nobody hears.

23:25.560 --> 23:29.240
 And as I do this, I start to evaluate whether or not

23:29.240 --> 23:30.840
 I'm straining to get the words out

23:30.840 --> 23:34.840
 or whether or not I'm straining to make them slow enough

23:34.840 --> 23:36.200
 so that I can articulate them.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.080
 So there are days when I have so much energy

23:39.800 --> 23:44.360
 that I'm trying to speak faster than I should

23:44.360 --> 23:45.960
 in order to articulate properly.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.320
 There are other days when I'm tired

23:47.320 --> 23:49.560
 and I can't sort of keep up with my thoughts.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.400
 And so what I try and do is assess that

23:51.400 --> 23:55.080
 and then adjust the transmission, the RPM so to speak.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.440
 For instance, I can speak very quickly

23:56.440 --> 23:57.720
 and then I can slow down.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.560
 So I can change the cadence of my voice.

23:59.560 --> 24:02.760
 And when you teach in the classroom, you learn as you know

24:02.760 --> 24:03.800
 because you're an excellent teacher,

24:03.800 --> 24:05.720
 I've watched your lectures in the classroom.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.680
 As you teach in the classroom when you want to slow down,

24:09.320 --> 24:11.800
 every teacher knows you turn to the whiteboard or chalkboard

24:11.800 --> 24:12.920
 and you start writing, right?

24:12.920 --> 24:15.000
 It gives you a break and then you turn around

24:15.000 --> 24:18.920
 and you fire back the kind of machine gun fire of information

24:18.920 --> 24:20.760
 and then you slow down or you underline something.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.440
 When you podcast, you don't have that opportunity, right?

24:24.440 --> 24:26.280
 There are no visuals in my podcast.

24:26.280 --> 24:31.400
 So what I try and do is always get my voice warmed up

24:31.400 --> 24:33.560
 and make sure that I'm thinking and speaking

24:33.560 --> 24:35.000
 at approximately the same rate.

24:35.880 --> 24:38.760
 And then I also do this thing of I put my vision

24:38.760 --> 24:41.560
 into panoramic vision when I walk, which is very calming.

24:42.520 --> 24:45.880
 And then I actually start to remind myself

24:45.880 --> 24:47.400
 of the purpose of podcasting.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.400
 This sounds very mission statement E,

24:49.400 --> 24:50.680
 but you asked what I do.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.680
 I remind myself first and foremost

24:54.680 --> 24:57.160
 that what I want to communicate, what I want to come through

24:57.160 --> 24:59.240
 is the beauty and utility of biology.

25:00.040 --> 25:03.720
 And I only feel comfortable saying the word beauty publicly now

25:04.280 --> 25:07.480
 about science things thanks to you because I think...

25:07.480 --> 25:08.920
 Love and beauty.

25:08.920 --> 25:09.880
 Yeah, love and beauty.

25:09.880 --> 25:10.520
 Love and beauty.

25:10.520 --> 25:11.800
 Dr. Andrew Hewerman.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.680
 Love and beauty, but also darkness and hatred.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.080
 And if you're talking about the Lex Freeman podcast,

25:17.080 --> 25:21.000
 you have to address the shadow, also the shadow side.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.200
 But I think about the...

25:22.200 --> 25:26.360
 I want to communicate the beauty and utility of biology.

25:26.360 --> 25:29.800
 And then I check my emotional state.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.440
 I want to make sure that I'm not angry about anything.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.480
 And certainly if I am, that I'm going to set it aside

25:35.480 --> 25:37.160
 for the podcast because that's not a place

25:37.160 --> 25:40.120
 for whatever I might be dealing with.

25:40.120 --> 25:43.320
 I also really start to feel into the parts of the research

25:43.320 --> 25:45.480
 and the papers I found that I really love

25:45.480 --> 25:50.680
 because that's the part of me that I like the most, frankly.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.600
 And on the podcast, if there's a paper...

25:54.600 --> 25:56.600
 Like for instance, we have a paper, excuse me,

25:56.600 --> 26:00.120
 a podcast coming out soon about heat as a tool.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.200
 Sauna, but some other things.

26:02.200 --> 26:07.320
 And in researching this, I learned so much about these heat shock proteins

26:07.320 --> 26:10.920
 and the use of sauna in Finland for increasing growth hormone,

26:10.920 --> 26:12.760
 but also for the treatment of mental illness.

26:12.760 --> 26:15.000
 And I realized I fell in love with this literature.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.760
 It's just a beautiful literature.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.840
 These people are true pioneers for doing this work.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.560
 Now everyone's in the sauna, but this was 20 years ago.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.640
 The way the experiments were done were amazing

26:23.640 --> 26:26.760
 with all these Finnish people with thermocouples up there,

26:26.760 --> 26:29.320
 rectum to measure temperature, swimming in pools.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.600
 It's hilarious and great.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.200
 And so I start to think about, and I think...

26:33.640 --> 26:36.520
 I just start to really access my love of the work.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.120
 And then when we finally sit down,

26:39.000 --> 26:41.720
 meaning my producer Rob and I and record,

26:41.720 --> 26:45.480
 I just sort of want to just bask in sharing it.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.040
 Just like the little version of me when I was six or seven,

26:48.040 --> 26:50.280
 I used to spend all weekend reading the Encyclopedia,

26:50.280 --> 26:52.120
 Guinness Book of World Records,

26:52.120 --> 26:55.080
 making my mother drive me places to introduce me to...

26:55.080 --> 26:56.920
 I had this obsession with trapping animals

26:56.920 --> 26:58.120
 when I was a kid, meet these people.

26:58.120 --> 27:01.960
 And then on Monday, I would insist on giving a lecture in class,

27:01.960 --> 27:02.920
 which is a little kid.

27:02.920 --> 27:03.960
 So that's basically what it is.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.920
 I just try and access that childlike energy.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.920
 And so I want to be clear.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.000
 The goal is always to make the information

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
 interesting, clear, and actionable.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.880
 And if it's also surprising, then that's a bonus.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.000
 But that's basically the process.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.400
 But yeah, I'm singing and talking and getting into state.

27:23.400 --> 27:27.000
 And I used to feel very sheepish about sharing any of this.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
 It's the first time I've ever shared it out loud.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.400
 But Rick was the one who encouraged me to find a process that works

27:33.400 --> 27:35.800
 and continue to develop that process

27:35.800 --> 27:38.600
 and not let anything get near that process.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.000
 People in my personal life know this.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.200
 And when it's time, it's like,

27:42.200 --> 27:44.200
 I don't care what else is going on,

27:44.200 --> 27:46.200
 I'm moving into that brain state.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.600
 And there's probably a process like that for anything

27:48.600 --> 27:51.000
 that you do in life that you take seriously.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.200
 So the people that have perfected this is athletes.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.800
 Like if Olympic level athletes,

27:55.800 --> 27:57.400
 they have to have a process like this.

27:57.400 --> 28:02.200
 I think Tiger Woods actually was taught self hypnosis quite young

28:02.200 --> 28:07.000
 and used self hypnosis often during his tournaments,

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
 sometimes to great success and other times less so.

28:11.000 --> 28:17.000
 Is there other places in life that you use kind of a protocol,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.800
 like a mental protocol to get ready?

28:19.800 --> 28:23.800
 Many of the best areas of life are their own form of hypnosis, right?

28:23.800 --> 28:25.000
 True.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
 You know that you're in hypnosis if, for instance,

28:27.000 --> 28:28.600
 you're in a movie and something happens

28:28.600 --> 28:32.600
 and you feel the emotional lift without being self conscious about it.

28:32.600 --> 28:39.000
 Yes, I think that one thing that we've tried to do in our house

28:39.000 --> 28:42.200
 is around meal times to try and set a state

28:42.200 --> 28:46.200
 that food isn't just something that we just throw down in our throats.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.200
 And I'm fortunate that my partner cooks really well

28:49.200 --> 28:52.200
 and so I try and give her the space to do that.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.200
 And that's a whole thing of her getting into state.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.200
 And then...

28:56.200 --> 28:57.200
 For the cooking.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.200
 For the cooking.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.200
 I can just see it.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.200
 I just see the way she approaches the whole thing

29:01.200 --> 29:02.800
 and the pleasure in serving it.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.800
 And I'm an eater, not a cooker.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.800
 Both are important roles.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.800
 You could be a very good eater.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.400
 There's something about, is there anything better in this world

29:13.400 --> 29:16.400
 than that feeling, especially if it's a family,

29:16.400 --> 29:20.400
 getting around a table, just the warmth of that.

29:20.400 --> 29:27.000
 I don't know, the cold outside of the cruel world

29:27.000 --> 29:29.800
 cannot touch you in this place that you've returned to.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.400
 And if... I mean...

29:32.400 --> 29:34.600
 Did you grow up eating meals as a family?

29:34.600 --> 29:35.600
 Yeah, yeah.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.800
 You used to sit down. No television.

29:37.800 --> 29:38.800
 No television.

29:38.800 --> 29:44.400
 I didn't really have a television period outside of meals.

29:44.400 --> 29:49.800
 So most of my time was spent like a stray cat

29:49.800 --> 29:53.800
 outdoors just running around playing soccer.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.800
 I imagine you in this dirt or concrete lot

29:56.800 --> 29:58.800
 between two very high rise buildings

29:58.800 --> 30:02.000
 playing soccer in athletic gear

30:02.000 --> 30:04.400
 that you only see in Eastern Europe.

30:04.400 --> 30:07.000
 You come to the States and people wear their athletic gear.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.200
 You go to Europe and you see...

30:09.200 --> 30:10.800
 Maybe it's the soccer culture,

30:10.800 --> 30:14.000
 but you see athletic gear that you just don't see anywhere else.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.800
 That's interesting. I mean, I grew up pretty poor.

30:16.800 --> 30:20.600
 So first of all, I was always wearing my brother's,

30:20.600 --> 30:23.400
 who's an older brother, brother's clothes.

30:23.400 --> 30:29.200
 And they were like old... Like, my favorite things

30:29.200 --> 30:31.800
 were American things that I didn't understand.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.000
 It would be like a Pepsi shirt or something.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.400
 And it was just... That was the gear.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.800
 And it was like too large for me,

30:37.800 --> 30:40.000
 but I thought I was the coolest person ever

30:40.000 --> 30:44.600
 just wearing this fancy, like Kanye type of fashion.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.400
 Yeah, there's something about it.

30:45.400 --> 30:48.600
 I feel like in Eastern Europe, they wear athletic gear

30:48.600 --> 30:50.400
 where like the guys like zip up the colors.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.000
 No, that's like fancy stuff.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.400
 That's if you like... Those are the cool kids.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.000
 I see. I see.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
 Like the cool soccer players, football players that...

31:00.000 --> 31:02.400
 Like they were in a league of some kind,

31:02.400 --> 31:04.600
 so they would get uniforms or like...

31:04.600 --> 31:06.800
 Or they somehow...

31:06.800 --> 31:10.400
 I always thought anyone who had anything nice

31:10.400 --> 31:13.000
 had to do something really bad to get it.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.600
 That was my way, view of the world.

31:15.600 --> 31:20.400
 Because I guess I didn't understand

31:20.400 --> 31:22.400
 how it's possible to be rich.

31:22.400 --> 31:25.200
 Because most of us were surrounded by people who were poor.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.800
 And that life was beautiful and simple.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.800
 And it's like, why do you escape that life?

31:28.800 --> 31:31.000
 But you still admire the cool...

31:31.000 --> 31:35.600
 Like when we got McDonald's, it was like,

31:35.600 --> 31:40.000
 what kind of world does this place come from?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.600
 Like who invented this?

31:42.600 --> 31:45.600
 It's a fascinating view from a child's perspective

31:45.600 --> 31:48.400
 of capitalism, essentially.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.200
 But the fact you ate dinner together is really interesting.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.400
 My parents divorced when I was an adolescent,

31:53.400 --> 31:56.400
 so then there was a total fracture of any family structure.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.800
 But prior to that, we ate dinner together every night.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.800
 I was expected to know how to use my knife and fork.

32:00.800 --> 32:05.800
 And it was like a very structured thing.

32:05.800 --> 32:09.000
 I don't know if kids do that now.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
 If I ever have kids, they're going to do that.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.600
 And certainly...

32:12.600 --> 32:15.200
 Actually, on the way over here, I was thinking...

32:15.200 --> 32:16.600
 I really want a lot of kids.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.200
 I want like a whole litter.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.000
 And I was thinking, if Lex has kids and I have kids,

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
 then we can like pit them against each other with Jiu Jitsu.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
 This is my chance at redemption.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
 It's the law game.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.200
 Right?

32:30.200 --> 32:32.800
 They'll all want to be engineers or physicists.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.600
 They won't want to be biologists.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.200
 But in all seriousness, I look forward to the day

32:38.200 --> 32:41.200
 that our kids play together.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.200
 Yeah, I think there's something...

32:43.200 --> 32:47.000
 So the family dinner, the ritual of the family dinner,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
 but also the special occasion dinners.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.800
 Like, where there's a little bit more preparation,

32:51.800 --> 32:53.600
 a little bit more cooking,

32:53.600 --> 32:56.800
 whether it's on the weekend or for some holiday.

32:56.800 --> 33:01.200
 In Russia, it was a thing that actually I find completely missing.

33:01.200 --> 33:04.600
 For the most part, in America is there was neighbors.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.600
 There was a...

33:06.600 --> 33:10.800
 You broke the walls between families much more commonly.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.600
 Like, there would be kind of regular characters,

33:13.600 --> 33:14.800
 like a sitcom almost.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.200
 You know, if you watch the sitcom,

33:16.200 --> 33:17.600
 it's never just the family.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.000
 There's always, like, other characters that...

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
 Just bursting in the door.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
 Bursting in the door.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.400
 I'm gonna start doing that here, just to make you feel at home.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.600
 I just started showing up at your studio.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
 I know where you live.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.400
 I think people want to respect, like, you know,

33:28.400 --> 33:30.600
 Michael Malis lives next door to me.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.600
 And I think people want to respect each other's privacy

33:33.600 --> 33:34.600
 or something like that.

33:34.600 --> 33:41.000
 And I think we all get super busy and, you know, like...

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
 It's kind of work to do this dinner together

33:46.000 --> 33:49.600
 or, you know, if you see it as a thing that needs to be scheduled,

33:49.600 --> 33:50.600
 it's work.

33:50.600 --> 33:51.600
 We get busy.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.600
 There's a lot of stuff going on.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.400
 But if it's part of a ritual or part of the culture,

33:55.400 --> 33:58.400
 all of those walls get broken down.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.400
 And then you realize, like, later looking back,

34:01.400 --> 34:03.000
 those are the things you miss.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.800
 Like, that's what life is about.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.000
 Like, all the stupid stuff you're doing in terms of career, whatever.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.200
 All the busy things.

34:09.200 --> 34:10.200
 Those don't matter.

34:10.200 --> 34:12.200
 What matters is the people.

34:12.200 --> 34:17.000
 Yeah, in academia, you know, this changed in the last few years, of course,

34:17.000 --> 34:21.600
 but one of the great joys was professors will stop by your office or your lab.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.400
 Nobody set up an appointment.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.400
 There's a guy when I was a professor in San Diego,

34:25.400 --> 34:27.600
 a guy named Harvey Cartney, he's a member of the National Academy.

34:27.600 --> 34:31.200
 He's the truly the world's expert in the evolution of vision

34:31.200 --> 34:33.600
 and evolution of brains, generally.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.200
 And he would show up in my lab.

34:35.200 --> 34:37.800
 And he would just start talking to the students in postdocs.

34:37.800 --> 34:42.400
 And, I mean, in a pure encyclopedia.

34:42.400 --> 34:43.800
 And then you'd at some point you'd say,

34:43.800 --> 34:46.600
 hey, Harvey, I got to go and you kick him out, right?

34:46.600 --> 34:50.800
 Or this guy, he's a physicist, David Klein, David Kleinfield, who's the same way.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.600
 Actually, David Kleinfield is an interesting one.

34:52.600 --> 34:57.200
 He, a student of his, went on to create the Beavis and Butthead cartoon.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.400
 And one of them is David.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.600
 He's a physics professor now.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.800
 People can look him up.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.200
 And David's one of those guys who's walking in your office.

35:03.200 --> 35:03.800
 He just sit down.

35:03.800 --> 35:04.800
 He just start talking to you.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.800
 And so there's a kind of a family feel.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.800
 It's like Cheers or Seinfeld or one of those shows where somebody just walks in.

35:10.800 --> 35:14.800
 And yeah, I think you and I both share a love of the community around things.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.800
 And podcasting is a little bit more isolated.

35:16.800 --> 35:20.800
 I should say for the guest episodes, the preparation is completely different

35:20.800 --> 35:22.800
 because it's more conversational.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.800
 And so there I don't do any of this business of putting myself into state.

35:25.800 --> 35:29.800
 I just try and make sure that the guest is taken care of.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.800
 And I do list out the questions I'm going to ask before.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.800
 But those actually really like the interview episodes far more

35:35.800 --> 35:37.800
 than I like doing the solo ones.

35:37.800 --> 35:38.800
 Just psychologically mean.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.800
 I just like learning from someone directly.

35:40.800 --> 35:41.800
 Yeah.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.800
 Because you asking an expert about something like sitting here with you

35:44.800 --> 35:48.800
 when we recorded the podcast where you were a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast.

35:48.800 --> 35:52.800
 And for the first time and finally someone was explaining to me the difference

35:52.800 --> 35:55.800
 between machine learning, artificial intelligence and all these other things.

35:55.800 --> 36:01.800
 You know, and I've finally forgiven you for making me cry about Costello on camera.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.800
 Because it helped me move through it.

36:03.800 --> 36:08.800
 But in all seriousness, the interview ones are a sheer pleasure.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.800
 The solo ones I really enjoy, but they're work.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.800
 Sometimes I think like I'm going to sweat a little blood prepping for them.

36:15.800 --> 36:19.800
 Well, it's interesting because I do think prepping for interviews,

36:19.800 --> 36:22.800
 having a similar process might be also very valuable.

36:22.800 --> 36:32.800
 I have to think about that because I think when you do a conversation for several hours,

36:32.800 --> 36:34.800
 especially when it's a high stakes one.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.800
 So it's not like you and I know.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.800
 It's more like it's just chatting and so on.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.800
 The world order isn't going to shift according to it.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.800
 Although you never know.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.800
 We can never know.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.800
 Knowing you will probably be into some pretty controversial topics in a few minutes.

36:45.800 --> 36:46.800
 Oh boy.

36:46.800 --> 36:47.800
 You like to ride the edge more than I do.

36:47.800 --> 36:48.800
 Oh boy.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.800
 There are a number of topics that I just completely avoid.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.800
 The response to those is always that I have a lot of opinions about that,

36:53.800 --> 36:55.800
 but not a lot to say.

36:55.800 --> 37:02.800
 Whereas you've become far braver in terms of the topics you'll encounter

37:02.800 --> 37:05.800
 and some of your guests have been a bit controversial.

37:05.800 --> 37:10.800
 Some of them are people that a lot of people don't like

37:10.800 --> 37:15.800
 and you've been willing to just sit down and maybe it's the jiu jitsu thing.

37:15.800 --> 37:16.800
 I don't know.

37:16.800 --> 37:17.800
 It is tricky.

37:17.800 --> 37:23.800
 One of my goals for this year is to talk to people that a lot of people really don't like.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.800
 Are you going to share with us?

37:25.800 --> 37:27.800
 And here I am.

37:27.800 --> 37:33.800
 People that are in prison, major political leaders,

37:33.800 --> 37:40.800
 I've been thinking a lot about how to talk to really difficult controversial figures,

37:40.800 --> 37:47.800
 but find together something with them that's deeply honest about their nature,

37:47.800 --> 37:52.800
 about the ideas they have about the world,

37:52.800 --> 37:56.800
 like reveal something real.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.800
 And some people, you have to be very careful.

37:59.800 --> 38:04.800
 Some people are very good at hiding the real inside them, even from themselves.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.800
 That's something I think about a lot.

38:06.800 --> 38:10.800
 I think about dictators of the past and I put myself in the mindset,

38:10.800 --> 38:14.800
 well, how do you reveal something real about this person to themselves?

38:14.800 --> 38:17.800
 I think that to me, and you kind of spoke to that,

38:17.800 --> 38:27.800
 but a great conversation is one where both of you discover something new.

38:27.800 --> 38:31.800
 It's not just, so I love that too.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.800
 That's my favorite thing that you mentioned,

38:33.800 --> 38:37.800
 you ask all kinds of questions and get excited to learn from an expert,

38:37.800 --> 38:44.800
 but also to push them to discover something about themselves, about their ideas together.

38:44.800 --> 38:52.800
 And then that discovery, and sometimes it's like, we don't see it in the moment,

38:52.800 --> 38:54.800
 but the audience hears it.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.800
 It's weird to say like, I would compare it to when you're a musician,

38:58.800 --> 39:01.800
 you're playing with other musicians, you lose yourself in the moment.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.800
 Yeah, it's like it's working right.

39:04.800 --> 39:13.800
 But you don't really see the big picture impact of what it's working right actually feels like.

39:13.800 --> 39:17.800
 And that's where the audience can see that.

39:17.800 --> 39:27.800
 If you talk to somebody evil, for me as an interviewer, I have to empathize with that person.

39:27.800 --> 39:32.800
 I want to understand, I have to put myself in that mind space and to put yourself in that mindset,

39:32.800 --> 39:38.800
 you really have to become that, you have to understand the evil inside of you.

39:38.800 --> 39:44.800
 You can't just think if somebody is in power and has used that power to abuse others,

39:44.800 --> 39:49.800
 you can't just be a, I personally, a person who seeks to understand,

39:49.800 --> 39:52.800
 you can't just be a journalist asking generic questions.

39:52.800 --> 39:57.800
 You have to put yourself in a place where you're somebody who's given a lot of power

39:57.800 --> 40:03.800
 and slowly you start to abuse that power and what does that person become?

40:03.800 --> 40:04.800
 Who are you?

40:04.800 --> 40:10.800
 I have to plug myself into those moments in my life in the past where I've been angry at something

40:10.800 --> 40:15.800
 and where I've been cruel because I was angry in little ways,

40:15.800 --> 40:20.800
 but then you magnify them at scale and I have to go there and that's very human.

40:20.800 --> 40:24.800
 And then I have to look at another person from across the table for me and I understand,

40:24.800 --> 40:26.800
 well, you're there too.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.800
 And then you had more opportunity to do truly cruel things.

40:30.800 --> 40:37.800
 And then where I have to plug myself into places where I've been,

40:37.800 --> 40:42.800
 I can imagine I can go where I was cruel to others and was unaware of it.

40:42.800 --> 40:47.800
 So I was in a mind space where I was thinking that I'm doing good and I was doing not good.

40:47.800 --> 40:51.800
 Again, I've never gotten an opportunity to do any of those things at a large scale,

40:51.800 --> 40:58.800
 but all of us have done it at a small scale and I plug myself into that and then we're here.

40:58.800 --> 41:02.800
 Or two, if it's somebody who's in prison, if it's somebody who's a dictator,

41:02.800 --> 41:08.800
 we're in that space where evil is all of us have the capacity to do that evil

41:08.800 --> 41:14.800
 and I have to imagine myself being able to do that evil and then we're here together

41:14.800 --> 41:17.800
 in that dark, dark place.

41:17.800 --> 41:21.800
 And then if it's just right, something real can actually come.

41:21.800 --> 41:27.800
 Something from that person's childhood may be awakening to a realization that

41:27.800 --> 41:30.800
 I thought it was a good person and I'm not.

41:30.800 --> 41:34.800
 And that only happens when you truly empathize.

41:34.800 --> 41:38.800
 Those moments of discovery are beautiful, but they also happen in science.

41:38.800 --> 41:43.800
 When you just have a conversation and you realize, I feel like talking to Stephen Wolfram,

41:43.800 --> 41:47.800
 I feel like we constantly realize beautiful things together.

41:47.800 --> 41:51.800
 On this element of evil and sociopathy,

41:51.800 --> 42:01.800
 Jung had this notion that we have all things inside us and that we all have the capacity to be good or evil, etc.

42:01.800 --> 42:08.800
 But I have a good fortune of working with somebody who has deep understanding of psychiatry,

42:08.800 --> 42:14.800
 but also psychoanalysis and Jungian theory and he said to me recently,

42:14.800 --> 42:20.800
 whether or not all people have all things inside them is still debated in the psychology community

42:20.800 --> 42:24.800
 and in the neuroscience community and as a matter of philosophy.

42:24.800 --> 42:29.800
 But there are certain people, not many, but there are certain people

42:29.800 --> 42:36.800
 from whom they've actually lived out many versions of their possible selves in the first person.

42:36.800 --> 42:41.800
 And so those are unique individuals and even if they tapped into these things as you mentioned

42:41.800 --> 42:48.800
 at a more minor level as opposed to impacting people negatively at scale.

42:48.800 --> 42:53.800
 So being able to access those different parts of oneself is key and you've been willing to step into that.

42:53.800 --> 42:57.800
 My podcast is not one in which we get down to those matters.

42:57.800 --> 43:02.800
 You never know, we might do an episode on narcissism and sociopathy.

43:02.800 --> 43:07.800
 The other thing that I took away from a conversation with a friend who was a lot of years in special operations

43:07.800 --> 43:12.800
 in the intelligence community, he said, you know, if you look at somebody's past,

43:12.800 --> 43:18.800
 at some point you will come to understand some pretty good reasons as to why they became who they are.

43:18.800 --> 43:22.800
 But you have to draw the, his words, the red line someplace.

43:22.800 --> 43:27.800
 And what he was referring to was the fact that certain people, at least in the eyes of certain communities,

43:27.800 --> 43:32.800
 deserve to be eliminated as a consequence of their actions, right?

43:32.800 --> 43:34.800
 Regardless of what drove them to those actions.

43:34.800 --> 43:42.800
 So it gets right down to the line between nature, nurture, neuroscience, and the law and justice.

43:42.800 --> 43:44.800
 Complicated, complicated themes.

43:44.800 --> 43:48.800
 I can think of a number of people that I would love to hear you interview.

43:48.800 --> 43:55.800
 And here I'm not revealing the reasons why, but except for the fact that I think you would be uniquely suited to bring out

43:55.800 --> 44:01.800
 the important components of the conversation that other people have not been able to do,

44:01.800 --> 44:12.800
 which for instance, Liz Holmes, this is one of the most mysterious and yet dislike people on the planet.

44:12.800 --> 44:16.800
 She's sort of synonymous with deception.

44:16.800 --> 44:22.800
 I don't know if there have been any real interviews of her since the whole thing.

44:22.800 --> 44:23.800
 I haven't followed that case.

44:23.800 --> 44:28.800
 I listened to the book and I followed it a little bit because it was happening in my hometown, right?

44:28.800 --> 44:30.800
 Theranos was right up the road.

44:30.800 --> 44:31.800
 The building's still there.

44:31.800 --> 44:32.800
 It's interesting.

44:32.800 --> 44:36.800
 It's some of the most premier real estate in Silicon Valley, but nobody wants it.

44:36.800 --> 44:41.800
 It's very hard to sell a home where somebody committed suicide or committed a murder even if it's a beautiful home.

44:41.800 --> 44:45.800
 It's sort of feel like the Theranos building is that building.

44:45.800 --> 44:47.800
 So that would be a really interesting interview.

44:47.800 --> 44:49.800
 I would love to hear that interview.

44:49.800 --> 44:54.800
 One of the most interesting dark human beings in science.

44:54.800 --> 44:55.800
 Yeah.

44:55.800 --> 44:58.800
 And then there'll even be people that say, was it even science?

44:58.800 --> 45:00.800
 It might have all been deception.

45:00.800 --> 45:09.800
 It might have been one part deception, one part goal setting mixed in with clearly that there were so many factors impacting what happened.

45:09.800 --> 45:18.800
 I think the big difference between Theranos and that story and some of the other stories about Silicon Valley where people promised a lot more than they could deliver.

45:18.800 --> 45:22.800
 Is they were promising things that were directly related to health and healthcare.

45:22.800 --> 45:33.800
 People were taking blood tests with the understanding that the data they were getting was important information about sexually transmitted diseases and other diseases and making real world decisions on the basis of that.

45:33.800 --> 45:42.800
 Whereas if you remember when the iPhone first came out and Steve Jobs was still alive and the phones were dropping calls if you held it in a particular way and his response was a little flip.

45:42.800 --> 45:50.800
 He said, hey folks, it's a phone as if like don't get so worked up, but people held them understandably to a very high standard.

45:50.800 --> 45:54.800
 It seemed and I don't know because I certainly wasn't there.

45:54.800 --> 46:00.800
 It seemed like she sort of adopted this idea that you could get it wrong a bunch of times before you get it right.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.800
 Except if the allegations are true.

46:02.800 --> 46:11.800
 And I think she was the found guilty, I believe, on a number of counts that a number of the things that they were doing were impacting real world decision making.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.800
 So Steve's point about the phone is just a phone.

46:13.800 --> 46:14.800
 Well, it depends on the call.

46:14.800 --> 46:18.800
 If you're calling 911, then it's not just a phone, right?

46:18.800 --> 46:22.800
 But in the case of blood tests and disease, that's serious.

46:22.800 --> 46:36.800
 I think that the Theranos case was super interesting to me because of the number of people from major universities and from government that both trusted her and the number of people who did not trust her and yet either didn't speak up or no one listened to them.

46:36.800 --> 46:42.800
 It was only in the forensic version of it that everyone said, oh, yeah, I knew that she was lying, et cetera, et cetera.

46:42.800 --> 46:43.800
 They were lying.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.800
 There are multiple people involved in those lies, apparently.

46:45.800 --> 46:53.800
 But I have a deep interest in the neuroscience of narcissism, sociopathy and some of the darker aspects of the mind.

46:53.800 --> 46:56.800
 So yeah, maybe someday we'll do a podcast together.

46:56.800 --> 47:06.800
 It can be like in the early 90s version of talk shows where we darken the lights and we do it together. You can use your voice because your voice is much more sinister sounding than mine.

47:06.800 --> 47:07.800
 Good cop, bad cop.

47:07.800 --> 47:19.800
 Well, it'd be interesting from a scientific perspective of somebody who is a sociopath or a psychopath how to reveal something real about them.

47:19.800 --> 47:25.800
 I think that requires not just, well, I don't know what that requires.

47:25.800 --> 47:30.800
 That requires the same skill that it takes to be a good therapist.

47:30.800 --> 47:31.800
 Right.

47:31.800 --> 47:37.800
 And some therapists won't work with sociopaths because they don't feel any progress can be made.

47:37.800 --> 47:44.800
 Some therapists will work with sociopaths because for the wealthy ones, they often, they want their money.

47:44.800 --> 47:52.800
 I think most therapists are good and benevolent, but there's some that will do it just the same way lawyers will work with criminals knowing they're criminals, right?

47:52.800 --> 47:54.800
 Oftentimes because they're criminals.

47:54.800 --> 47:59.800
 There are certain domains of psychiatry that are more tractable than others, right?

47:59.800 --> 48:00.800
 Borderlines are interesting.

48:00.800 --> 48:03.800
 I should just mention because they have this phenomenon of splitting.

48:03.800 --> 48:09.800
 So in the world of psychology, the idea is that being neurotic is actually the goal.

48:09.800 --> 48:19.800
 The idea that you could be, you know, feel something and then work a lot to overcome it or have some sort of defense mechanism in place, but that's not destructive.

48:19.800 --> 48:24.800
 That's actually a pretty healthy state to be in. It's provided it's not destructive.

48:24.800 --> 48:29.800
 Psychotic is truly delusional thinking about reality.

48:29.800 --> 48:36.800
 And the idea is that borderlines split, intermittently split between psychotic and neurotic.

48:36.800 --> 48:42.800
 That's why it's called this beautiful work by Melanie Klein that describes this, which I'm just now kind of delving into.

48:42.800 --> 48:51.800
 But, you know, so the borderline is the person who is like, I love you, I love you, I love you, and then truly feels as if they hate you and you become the bad object.

48:51.800 --> 48:56.800
 Borderlines are challenging for psychologists because of the splitting, right?

48:56.800 --> 49:02.800
 Schizophrenics are challenging because of the detachment from reality.

49:02.800 --> 49:09.800
 And narcissists are challenging because they're often so charming that even the therapists are charmed.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.800
 I believe you mentioned Carl Dessaroth. We'll talk about him.

49:12.800 --> 49:15.800
 He was definitely not a narcissist. He's one of the more humble people, but he is brilliant.

49:15.800 --> 49:19.800
 Thanks again to you. You've connected us.

49:19.800 --> 49:24.800
 I had the pleasure of having a conversation with him. You had a conversation with him. I really enjoyed it on the podcast.

49:24.800 --> 49:30.800
 You guys come from the same science, from the same place, maybe different journeys, fascinating things.

49:30.800 --> 49:37.800
 And levels. We were postdocs together. Carl is truly the Michael Jordan, the Wayne Gretzky.

49:37.800 --> 49:42.800
 Five children, amazing marriage to it. Also an amazing scientist, his wife, Michelle Mongees,

49:42.800 --> 49:50.800
 in our neurology department at Stanford, incredible thinker, writer, very kind person, humble.

49:50.800 --> 49:53.800
 Speaking of getting into state, sorry, Carl, I'm going to out you on this.

49:53.800 --> 50:01.800
 But Carl, despite being at the highest levels of science and engineering and a practicing psychiatrist,

50:01.800 --> 50:07.800
 his office is literally a coat closet with a small table lamp.

50:07.800 --> 50:11.800
 When you meet with Carl, if you manage to meet with him, because he's very hard to get to,

50:11.800 --> 50:17.800
 you walk in, you sit down as if you're going through some interrogation and some spy novel,

50:17.800 --> 50:21.800
 and he'll ask you, what are you most excited about lately?

50:21.800 --> 50:26.800
 And I've got 11 minutes or something. And that's a meeting with Carl, because he's that busy.

50:26.800 --> 50:32.800
 But he doesn't have the office with the pictures of the kids and the thing and all that is kept elsewhere.

50:32.800 --> 50:35.800
 So in order to get, I asked him, why do you work in this office, right?

50:35.800 --> 50:39.800
 You work on light and channels of light, things relate to light of all things.

50:39.800 --> 50:42.800
 Here you are in this dark room, and he said, well, this is what gets me into the state of mind

50:42.800 --> 50:48.800
 to be able to do what I want to do. Very Rick Rubin ish, not at all the same person,

50:48.800 --> 50:52.800
 but very similar in that he's figured out the physical space he needs in order to get into the optimal state

50:52.800 --> 50:56.800
 to do the work he needs to do in this lifetime. And it's very unusual, right?

50:56.800 --> 50:59.800
 If I don't have a window, I kind of freak out. I can do it here for a while.

50:59.800 --> 51:03.800
 We're in this black cube here, floating in space, of course.

51:03.800 --> 51:09.800
 But I find that amazing that these people that are operating at this super high level

51:09.800 --> 51:13.800
 are willing to actually deprive themselves of a lot of conditions.

51:13.800 --> 51:17.800
 They're not sitting there with the secretary coming in, offering them espresso every five minutes

51:17.800 --> 51:22.800
 and things like that. No, no, no. That's New York Neuroscience.

51:22.800 --> 51:27.800
 The New York Neuroscience Mafia is kind of famous for having all the tickets to the opera and this and that,

51:27.800 --> 51:29.800
 and they enjoy lifestyle a lot.

51:29.800 --> 51:31.800
 The New York Neuroscience Mafia.

51:31.800 --> 51:33.800
 Oh, there is one. There definitely is one. They know who they are.

51:33.800 --> 51:35.800
 They know who they are.

51:35.800 --> 51:38.800
 People don't know Andrew Huberman is from the West Coast,

51:38.800 --> 51:41.800
 and now he's just starting wars with the Neuroscience Mafia.

51:41.800 --> 51:45.800
 Well, they do amazing science. They love their lifestyle, and that's wonderful.

51:45.800 --> 51:47.800
 The culture is very different.

51:47.800 --> 51:54.800
 Carl and I think Silicon Valley in general kind of prides itself on this kind of monk like it says,

51:54.800 --> 51:55.800
 Sism, right?

51:55.800 --> 51:59.800
 But at the individual scale, be deliberate about controlling the environment.

51:59.800 --> 52:01.800
 I think about that with the conversations too.

52:01.800 --> 52:07.800
 I haven't been deliberate about that either in terms of controlling the space you're in.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.800
 Visually, yes, black curtains, all those kinds of things.

52:10.800 --> 52:14.800
 There is nothing like the Lex Friedman podcast studio.

52:14.800 --> 52:19.800
 First of all, when you do them remotely, I always feel like I'm in a witness relocation program.

52:19.800 --> 52:20.800
 Exactly.

52:20.800 --> 52:22.800
 You only get the coordinates at the last moment,

52:22.800 --> 52:29.800
 and you always get the sense that there are people behind the walls that are recording things.

52:29.800 --> 52:32.800
 Well, there's something about creating a feeling.

52:32.800 --> 52:34.800
 I have a sense that there's a robot over there.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.800
 There's several throughout this place.

52:36.800 --> 52:49.800
 I think part of creating a feeling would be having the robots constantly moving around and having a mind of their own.

52:49.800 --> 53:00.800
 Because that would most closely put guests and other humans that interact with into a place that's closest to my mind.

53:00.800 --> 53:07.800
 Because that's such an engineering mind, and one where when things come to life, it's a beautiful place to be.

53:07.800 --> 53:11.800
 And whatever that is, that could be art, but to me, robots are art.

53:11.800 --> 53:16.800
 And so I'm thinking about that, both for me and for guests.

53:16.800 --> 53:19.800
 And I'm also thinking about the difficult guests.

53:19.800 --> 53:25.800
 Just to return to, you said, Elizabeth Holmes, one person, maybe a couple of things I want to say.

53:25.800 --> 53:33.800
 One person I think I would like to talk to is Ghislaine Maxwell.

53:33.800 --> 53:36.800
 I always get afraid right before you reveal these kinds of things.

53:36.800 --> 53:38.800
 And now I know why I get afraid.

53:38.800 --> 53:45.800
 Again, assuming that she did the things that people claim she did, they're despicable.

53:45.800 --> 53:47.800
 These were underage children.

53:47.800 --> 53:56.800
 There's just no version of the story where she did the things she was accused of doing and is still a quote unquote good person.

53:56.800 --> 53:58.800
 In my mind.

53:58.800 --> 54:05.800
 And yet, I think there is tremendous interest in understanding what led her to do all that.

54:05.800 --> 54:06.800
 At least for some people.

54:06.800 --> 54:08.800
 Let me say a couple of things.

54:08.800 --> 54:18.800
 One is at a high level, let me say that she believes or her current story is that she's the victim.

54:18.800 --> 54:19.800
 Of who?

54:19.800 --> 54:20.800
 Jeffrey Epstein.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.800
 Oh my.

54:22.800 --> 54:26.800
 I think I'll just leave that there as is.

54:26.800 --> 54:30.800
 So these are ideas that you're facing.

54:30.800 --> 54:35.800
 The nature of truth and the nature of the human mind is what it is.

54:35.800 --> 54:44.800
 And this is imagine folks, if you went into a room with a person that says that, what do you do next?

54:44.800 --> 54:51.800
 Let me also say that I never or rarely, let me sit down and say never.

54:51.800 --> 55:02.800
 I rarely mentioned names that I'm interested in talking to without having made significant progress in already securing that interview.

55:02.800 --> 55:08.800
 So people sometimes ask me about Vladimir Zelensky and Vladimir Putin.

55:08.800 --> 55:16.800
 I do not bring them up lightly in terms of there's in terms of there being a path to an actual conversation.

55:16.800 --> 55:23.800
 That said, something I regret, but I'm not sure I know what to do with it.

55:23.800 --> 55:29.800
 But in the case of all the people I just mentioned, I haven't been preparing for those conversations.

55:29.800 --> 55:39.800
 I only start really preparing seriously when it's confirmed because it's such a heavy burden.

55:39.800 --> 55:54.800
 And one of the things I regret in having mentioned a conversation with Vladimir Putin before the war in Ukraine broke out in the past few years is that I would mention it very loosely, very casually.

55:54.800 --> 56:02.800
 And without having really deeply put myself into a place that I'm ready to talk to him.

56:02.800 --> 56:16.800
 And that's a tricky thing because then the internet, the audience in general, and just me when I listen back to my dumb self think, well, why are you speaking so lightly about these topics?

56:16.800 --> 56:35.800
 Well, I know you've had a longstanding interest in talking to him. I think now, well, I don't understand how I would sit down and have a conversation with somebody like that, but that's not in the range of my skill sets.

56:35.800 --> 56:41.800
 Or maybe not in the range of things that you're drawn to somehow.

56:41.800 --> 56:46.800
 Not so much. I mean, I would watch that episode with great interest.

56:46.800 --> 56:54.800
 Well, you did an episode recently with this guy who was a former cyber criminal turned stateside, right? I think he works for the government now.

56:54.800 --> 56:57.800
 And there was a segment in there. Remind me his name?

56:57.800 --> 56:58.800
 Brett Johnson.

56:58.800 --> 57:17.800
 There was a segment in there where he talked about stealing a lifetime's worth of collected coins from some elderly woman. And this was everything she had. And then he openly admitted that he felt no remorse, which is the way he described is purely sociopathic.

57:17.800 --> 57:39.800
 And then, of course, we learned that he grew up in a family where criminal behavior was very common. It was kind of embedded in his notions of what typical behaviors were. And I felt myself somewhat conflicted, but also hung up on this idea that he had behaved as a sociopath or in a sociopathic way.

57:39.800 --> 57:55.800
 And it created an internal conflict because he's quite charming guest and his stories are terrific. Especially, I really enjoyed his discussions about how he would go out and do all these things out of a desire to please his girlfriend.

57:55.800 --> 58:10.800
 So he was in service to other people, despite being a sociopath. He could say he was in service to them as a way to extract. It gets very complicated. I think it's the reason I went into science is that at some level, it's more about facts than it is opinions and judgments.

58:10.800 --> 58:27.800
 And I don't know that I have the ability to suspend judgment away from the kind of top level contours of my initial reaction to like, if it's true, like the Glenn Maxwell's and the Liz Holmes and other sociopaths is one of just kind of revulsion and repulsion.

58:27.800 --> 58:44.800
 But that could also reflect the fact that I'm not as neurologically sophisticated as somebody that can spin all the plates of empathy, forgiveness, but also holding people accountable at the same time. That's work.

58:44.800 --> 58:54.800
 If you think about it, that's three, four brain circuits having to work in parallel. That's the difference between chess or a game of go and a game of checkers. I guess I'm playing checkers.

58:54.800 --> 59:07.800
 No, so one is actually holding in your mind and two is the raw skill of conversation. You're very, just having listened to your interviews, you're very good at conversation, but the skill of conversation is really tricky.

59:07.800 --> 59:17.800
 I'm not being self deprecating. I'm being just objective. I'm not good at conversation. I'm working very hard, getting better at it.

59:17.800 --> 59:29.800
 I'm speaking not about just podcasting. I'm speaking just normal life. I have anxiety from social interaction.

59:29.800 --> 59:30.800
 Do you really?

59:30.800 --> 59:32.800
 Huge amount, yeah.

59:32.800 --> 59:50.800
 So this is interesting because I never detect that in you ever. And I think there are people that we both know that have said to me that they too feel anxious and yet your voice is steady. I don't see any perspiration.

59:50.800 --> 59:51.800
 Oh yeah.

59:51.800 --> 59:53.800
 You appear incredibly calm.

59:53.800 --> 59:54.800
 I'm scared shitless.

59:54.800 --> 59:56.800
 I was scared shitless with Rick Rubin.

59:56.800 --> 1:00:16.800
 Rick Rubin is, when you first meet him, is intimidatingly calm. But as you get to know him a bit, you realize that his, the kindness and the generosity that you sense is real. But yeah, I would never in a million years have guessed that you get anxious in conversation.

1:00:16.800 --> 1:00:37.800
 Okay, I just make another quick comment. This may come off entertaining to you, Andrew. Maybe you've already gotten the same. But having mentioned of Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Zelensky, Ghislaine Maxwell, there is a natural question.

1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:45.800
 How does Lex have access to these people? Who does he work for?

1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:47.800
 Like, how does he?

1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:49.800
 Who works for him?

1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:50.800
 Who works for him?

1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:51.800
 Right.

1:00:51.800 --> 1:01:12.800
 What does he have on others? This, I'm actually, I asked my, when I look in the mirror, just somebody who kind of enjoys conspiracy theories. I want to ask the same question. Like, well, I usually ask in the following way, like, how the fuck am I so lucky? Like, who am I being, am I a robot being controlled by somebody else?

1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:31.800
 Like, how is this, how is this my life right now? What is happening? It really does feel like a simulation. So let me just speak to several things. First of all, I have no boss. I know, I know of, nor am I controlled by any intelligence agencies of any nation.

1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:33.800
 We're going to get you a dog, Lex.

1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:40.800
 So that I could talk to. I'm scared of getting a dog because I would fall in love so deeply, I think that.

1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:45.800
 Next time I'm bringing a puppy. I'm just going to bring a puppy and I'm going to leave it here.

1:01:45.800 --> 1:02:01.800
 And then you'll never see me again. I mean, I love dogs so much, but I was also surprised and maybe, I have never talked to an intelligence agency, which is very interesting to me.

1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:07.800
 That you're aware of, because they're very good at communicating with people.

1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:21.800
 Right. But I've been very suspicious on this exact point. That's the downside of kind of being an introvert, having anxiety about social interaction, but then having so much love thrown your way because we connect over podcasts.

1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:31.800
 Podcasts have a powerful way of connecting people. So people come with you with love that I really love. I appreciate, but I wonder, like, exactly this question.

1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:38.800
 Like, why is this person with a Russian accent talking to me and showing me so much love?

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:56.800
 Well, because, sorry to interrupt you again, but it's what we do. And it's a sign of interest, by the way. Sometimes, yeah, I have a colleague at Stanford and she said, you know, interruption, 75% of this time is a sign of real interest in what the person is saying, if nothing else.

1:02:56.800 --> 1:03:09.800
 Well, you're very lovable. I mean, I learned about hedgehog in the fog from you. You know, when I learned, you know, you're very lovable. People love you because you're lovable.

1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:19.800
 I love love. Okay. So 100%. And it's, I mean, especially here in Austin, Texas, people are so amazing. I go just hugs and just, I love people.

1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:38.800
 But do you want a family? Are you eventually 100%? No, I mean, you're, I take what you said as a challenge in terms of having a family with kids and they do jujitsu and obviously defeat you and make you miserable for your failures as a father because you couldn't.

1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:40.800
 You can be a great dad.

1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:56.800
 Build up an army of good jujitsu people. But yes, I would love a family. I would love to have children. But I just want to finish that point. I'm nervous about it. I'm nervous about the way people perceive what you're seeing as a forest comp type character, like what who I am.

1:03:56.800 --> 1:04:10.800
 I seem to be, and this is how like the world seems to work, is you just try, you try to be yourself, like you try to find yourself. That's maybe the better way to say it and just be that.

1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:28.800
 Be kind to people, work your ass off and say F you to anybody that wants to control you or to tell you what to do. Just be free and then put love out there in the world and doors open. This karma thing seems to work.

1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:41.800
 Like how the hell did, how the hell, my friends as you know, how the hell did I get a chance to eat barbecue with Rick Rubin, right? Like you guys had barbecue.

1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:48.800
 He's from New York. Any New Yorker that I know has very high standards for food because bad restaurants don't last long in New York.

1:04:48.800 --> 1:05:02.800
 And barbecue houses. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Texas barbecue. Well, you know, I would also add that you, whether or not you realize it or not, you took tremendous risk. I mean, we come from the same original community, which is academic science, right?

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:25.800
 And to be at MIT and to start posting lectures online is risky, right? To, you know, I was third or fourth man in on in terms of podcasting as an academic because you had gone on Rogan many times. David Sinclair had gone on there, you know, especially before the pandemic, you just didn't see many academics and scientists talking in a public facing way.

1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:40.800
 So you took tremendous risk, right? You took tremendous risk, always wearing that jacket and tie, right? The only time I haven't seen you in that truly is when we rolled jujitsu, which is, and I hear I'm being generous to myself saying I rolled jujitsu and basically you choked me out in front of hundreds of thousands.

1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:41.800
 That was really risky.

1:05:41.800 --> 1:05:47.800
 It was great fun. And I thank you for doing that to have a beginner's mind is a beautiful thing.

1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:58.800
 I have admittedly, I have not been taking the classes, but I'm going to. I truly am. Especially there's a small chance I might find myself in Austin a bit more often in the near future.

1:05:58.800 --> 1:05:59.800
 But the

1:05:59.800 --> 1:06:03.800
 Well, if you're out in San Francisco, you train with Mark Zuckerberg. He just started. So there you go.

1:06:03.800 --> 1:06:04.800
 Oh, yeah.

1:06:04.800 --> 1:06:05.800
 You guys can

1:06:05.800 --> 1:06:06.800
 Interesting.

1:06:06.800 --> 1:06:07.800
 Sure.

1:06:07.800 --> 1:06:13.800
 I mean, he's actually, I mean, people listen to an episode, perhaps he's a fascinating human being.

1:06:13.800 --> 1:06:14.800
 I listen to it.

1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:15.800
 That's great.

1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:19.800
 You took tremendous risk as an academic to do what you did.

1:06:19.800 --> 1:06:30.800
 So I do believe that when one takes intelligent risk, because you can die or can crash your career, you can do all sorts of self destructive or destructive things when taking risks.

1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:32.800
 You took risks and they paid off.

1:06:32.800 --> 1:06:33.800
 Right.

1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:38.800
 And you take different risks at different stages, but I don't throw around the word admiration lightly.

1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:43.800
 I mean, I admire that you were in this classroom and in my team, like I'm going to film this and put it online.

1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:48.800
 One of your early interviews is with Ido Portal, who's very hard to get to.

1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:50.800
 I've communicated with Ido a few times.

1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:51.800
 You should definitely talk to him.

1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:52.800
 I can't wait to talk to him.

1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:53.800
 I'm dying to talk to him.

1:06:53.800 --> 1:07:00.800
 I was supposed to do some course teaching with him right before the pandemic hit and then it got canceled because it couldn't travel.

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:02.800
 But getting to him is exceedingly challenging.

1:07:02.800 --> 1:07:09.800
 So you do have this incredible ability to get to people and for them to trust you and know you.

1:07:09.800 --> 1:07:11.800
 And I think it's through your authenticity.

1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:15.800
 And I think it's the fact that you're willing to go places where people haven't been before.

1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:18.800
 You know, this is what's the saying about pioneers.

1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:19.800
 How do you spot the pioneers?

1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:22.800
 They're the people with the arrows in their backs, you know.

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:25.800
 So that's the, you know, yeah.

1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:31.800
 And that's actually a quote that I lifted from Terry Szygnowski, who's a, you know,

1:07:31.800 --> 1:07:33.800
 you should talk to Terry.

1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:38.800
 He's a computational neuroscientist down at the Salk Institute.

1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:40.800
 Howard Hughes investigator, et cetera.

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:47.800
 But so, you know, taking risks that other people have not taken is, that's a real thing.

1:07:47.800 --> 1:07:52.800
 And to do it with integrity and rigor, that's a real thing.

1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:57.800
 And so, yeah, I'm complimenting you and I hope it lands and lands deeply.

1:07:57.800 --> 1:08:05.800
 But I also hope that people will hear that and understand that it's one thing to do what other people are already doing boldly.

1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:11.800
 It's a whole other thing to launch an entire art form or venue and you did that.

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:15.800
 And you didn't write a book, hopefully you will someday, but you didn't go write a book.

1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:17.800
 A lot of academics have written books.

1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:18.800
 You went online.

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:21.800
 Jordan Peterson, another controversial character.

1:08:21.800 --> 1:08:25.800
 He did it too, all those lectures that he filmed and then it's led to this other thing.

1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:34.800
 So, you know, there's karma and then there's also having the spine to just put it all on the line

1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:42.800
 and do something for which there is no prior example to hold on to while you go through those headwinds.

1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:47.800
 The really fascinating thing and actually a lot of people tell me about you, Andrew Cuban,

1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:52.800
 like the reach of a podcast is really fascinating.

1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:55.800
 It's not the numbers of people listen.

1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:58.800
 I don't know if that's important at all.

1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:03.800
 What's important is like the depth of connection you have with certain people.

1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:07.800
 It really moves them and like they really get you.

1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:11.800
 So, there's a lot of big Andrew Huberman fans that really get you.

1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:13.800
 It's not just the science.

1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:15.800
 It's the stuff between the lines.

1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:16.800
 It's Costello.

1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:22.800
 It's the whole picture of a scientist that finds beauty and biology and reveals it and they love you for it.

1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:30.800
 You know, because it was on television at the time, I followed that Amanda Knox story pretty carefully.

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:36.800
 And I don't watch television, but whenever I would travel, if there was a TV on the airplane,

1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:42.800
 I would find myself getting wrapped into things like locked up abroad and these things were,

1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:46.800
 which would make you terrified to travel anywhere, let alone commit a crime overseas.

1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:50.800
 The scenes of some of these prisons are so dramatic.

1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:56.800
 I mean, her case got a ton of interest and then she went and then was a student at the University of Washington

1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:03.800
 and has talked quite openly about how she was treated and how people assume guilt and eventually,

1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:07.800
 she was exonerated and we can only go by what we know with the law determined.

1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:12.800
 But these are people that the world is fascinated by.

1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:17.800
 I'm guessing about a third of people have already decided this person is despicable.

1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:19.800
 Why would you ever give them an audience?

1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:26.800
 About a third of people, I think, are open to or at least interested in learning more about them.

1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:32.800
 And then I think the remaining third, kind of the third category that I put myself in,

1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:39.800
 which is what can I learn about people and myself even in my revulsion?

1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:40.800
 Right.

1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:47.800
 What can I learn about myself from listening to this conversation with somebody that I like to think,

1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:50.800
 I'm not talking about Amanda here, I'm talking about the other people that you're talking about,

1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:53.800
 that I can't relate to.

1:10:53.800 --> 1:10:59.800
 Hearing conversations with and about people that you cannot relate to is informative.

1:10:59.800 --> 1:11:03.800
 Otherwise, your whole mind literally becomes insular.

1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:09.800
 Well, there's an interesting thing I also had to, ever since the war in Ukraine broke out,

1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:14.800
 one of the questions I was asking myself, and this is not to be dramatic,

1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:20.800
 it's just a very simple, honest question that I think a lot of journalists that operate in the war zone

1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:26.800
 or documentary filmmakers, that every single guy has a chance to meet, have to be honest with themselves,

1:11:26.800 --> 1:11:33.800
 are you willing to put at risk your life for things you do?

1:11:33.800 --> 1:11:35.800
 What are you willing to die for?

1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:37.800
 What are you willing to die for?

1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:43.800
 It sounds very dramatic, but whenever risk goes up,

1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:50.800
 I mean, I don't know, you ask that if you want to take out a trip out to space on a commercial space flight.

1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:55.800
 Are you willing to die for this journey?

1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:57.800
 Now, the odds there are really small.

1:11:57.800 --> 1:11:59.800
 I just watched Apollo 13 again.

1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:00.800
 Great movie.

1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:01.800
 Yeah, great movie.

1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:03.800
 I'm not going to space.

1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:04.800
 I'm not going to space.

1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:06.800
 I'm afraid of heights.

1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:08.800
 No, I'm not afraid of heights.

1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:11.800
 It feels like a terrible place to die.

1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:13.800
 Yeah.

1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:16.800
 Well, first of all, death anywhere is not great.

1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:21.800
 Yeah, although, you know, I have a song teed up in my phone.

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:25.800
 If the plane starts to go down, I'm going to spend the last few.

1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:26.800
 It's a rare song.

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:27.800
 Nobody knows it.

1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:30.800
 It's a song off a B track of my favorite band, which is Rancid.

1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:32.800
 It's called The Sentence.

1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:35.800
 And I love it, and I listen to it almost every day.

1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:37.800
 Rancid, The Sentence?

1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:39.800
 The band is called Rancid.

1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:41.800
 Famous band, relatively.

1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:42.800
 Love those guys.

1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:43.800
 Love their music.

1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:44.800
 And the song is The Sentence.

1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:46.800
 You can only find it on a B side or outtake.

1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:50.800
 And if you don't know how to decipher Tim Armstrong's voice,

1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:52.800
 then you probably won't understand the lyrics,

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:54.800
 because it's sung very, very fast.

1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:56.800
 But if the plane ever goes, anytime there's turbulence,

1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:57.800
 I put that thing in.

1:12:57.800 --> 1:12:58.800
 I put the headphones in.

1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:00.800
 I'm like, well, you know, if it's time, it's time.

1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:01.800
 I'm going to go out like this.

1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:03.800
 I don't want to drift off into the galaxy

1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:05.800
 just slowly asphyxiating and freezing to death.

1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:07.800
 That sounds horrible.

1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:09.800
 Just like I wouldn't want to drown.

1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:10.800
 But on a plane is okay?

1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:12.800
 Well, on a plane, I mean, like if the thing starts going down

1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:14.800
 and there's truly nothing you can do,

1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:16.800
 you might as well at least listen to your favorite song.

1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:17.800
 Yeah, true.

1:13:17.800 --> 1:13:18.800
 True.

1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:19.800
 I'll probably go with the pixies.

1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:20.800
 Where's my mind?

1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:21.800
 Like from Fight Club.

1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:23.800
 And just the calmness, just sit back.

1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:25.800
 Like the musician is playing at the Titanic.

1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:27.800
 I didn't know you were a pixies fan.

1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:28.800
 I'm going to have to.

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:29.800
 Not so much a pixies fan.

1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:33.800
 Actually, I should say that I just, that was the,

1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:34.800
 where's my mind?

1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:37.800
 It was the chosen song for Fight Club at the end

1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:41.800
 when the buildings are coming down or something like that.

1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:45.800
 So that there's certain songs that just fit just right

1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:48.800
 for the collapse of human civilization.

1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:53.800
 And you're calmly appreciating like that.

1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:54.800
 That's just it.

1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:57.800
 This is how absurd this life is at any moment it can end.

1:13:57.800 --> 1:13:58.800
 And this is it.

1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:03.800
 I love how we both have death and demise.

1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:04.800
 Yeah.

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:05.800
 Soundtracks.

1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:06.800
 It's just a question.

1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:09.800
 When you're an academic doesn't come up often.

1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:10.800
 Right.

1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:11.800
 That's all.

1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:12.800
 Yeah.

1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:15.800
 There are some academics that are bold and brave.

1:14:15.800 --> 1:14:17.800
 It's not a phenotype.

1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:19.800
 Being bold and brave in the physical world is

1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:21.800
 not a common phenotype of academics.

1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:23.800
 I mean, the great neurologist, one of my,

1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:27.800
 I don't have many heroes, but Oliver Sacks is a true hero.

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:29.800
 I mean, people think of him as a writer,

1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:31.800
 but he was foremost a neurologist

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:35.800
 and he took tremendous pushback from the neurology community

1:14:35.800 --> 1:14:38.800
 for doing his books and his articles.

1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:40.800
 He has a great biography called On The Move.

1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:42.800
 There's a wonderful documentary that just came out about him.

1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:43.800
 He died in 2015.

1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:48.800
 I'm actually kind of a collector of his things,

1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:52.800
 but he had tremendous, but he was accused of horrible things

1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:55.800
 until the movie Awakenings came out

1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:57.800
 with De Niro and Robin Williams.

1:14:57.800 --> 1:14:58.800
 Amazing movie, by the way.

1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:01.800
 People don't, they seem to not say great things about the movie.

1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:02.800
 I love them.

1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:03.800
 It was amazing.

1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:07.800
 And it was only once he became famous from that movie

1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:12.800
 that his more academic work started to receive any kind of attention.

1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:14.800
 And he was invited back to Columbia and NYU.

1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:17.800
 You know, the New York neuroscience mafia is a real thing.

1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:19.800
 And yes, you know who you are.

1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:21.800
 And some of them are actually coming on the broadcast.

1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:23.800
 They are...

1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:26.800
 I think we talked offline about this.

1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:30.800
 We should start a mafia to fight off whatever's going on in the East Coast.

1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:33.800
 Although I'm still in MIT, so I don't know how that works,

1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:35.800
 but Boston is different than New York.

1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:38.800
 Yeah, so I have tremendous respect for science done in New York.

1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:39.800
 Don't get me wrong.

1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:40.800
 They are excellent scientists.

1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:43.800
 It's just a very different culture than on the West Coast.

1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:45.800
 And the personalities...

1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:48.800
 Tremendous respect for the mob.

1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:53.800
 And the personalities are a bit more grandiose.

1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:58.800
 However, because of some of the shift in science culture in the last few years,

1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:02.800
 things around scandals and things of that sort,

1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:06.800
 they've been forced to tamp down some of their personality,

1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:08.800
 or at least their outspoken personality.

1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:12.800
 And I actually think it's revealed something really important and useful in science,

1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:17.800
 which is, you know, it used to be the case you could really inject your personality into what you do.

1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:20.800
 You know, Richard Feynman is a good example.

1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:24.800
 If he did today what he did then,

1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:27.800
 bongo drumming on the roof of Caltech, naked,

1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:31.800
 working out theorems in strict clubs and things of that,

1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:34.800
 he would have lost his job in moments, right?

1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:37.800
 So that kind of behavior isn't celebrated anymore.

1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:38.800
 It's actually punished.

1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:41.800
 And I'm only half kidding about this New York neuroscience mafia,

1:16:41.800 --> 1:16:44.800
 but because I now exist in multiple realms, I can say these sorts of things.

1:16:44.800 --> 1:16:46.800
 And I, again, admiration and respect,

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:51.800
 but I will say that I think it's important that people in science

1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:54.800
 and kids that are curious about science understand that

1:16:54.800 --> 1:17:00.800
 you can have any personality provided that you're ethical and respectful in science

1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:02.800
 and do well, right?

1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:06.800
 They're true bench scientists that just want to be at the bench.

1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:08.800
 There are people that just want to be in their office.

1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:11.800
 There are people that really enjoy public speaking.

1:17:11.800 --> 1:17:12.800
 And there are people that love meetings.

1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:13.800
 There are people that hate crowds.

1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:17.800
 And so there's a place for everybody, truly a place for everybody in science.

1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:22.800
 I would like to be able to shine light on the fact that there are,

1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:26.800
 you can have a shy personality, an outgoing personality,

1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:31.800
 and you can, all of those can be, have excellent careers in science.

1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:34.800
 But you have to find the community in place that's right for you.

1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:38.800
 One reason I like Stanford is that Stanford is very much about the future.

1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:40.800
 We have Nobel Prize winners.

1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:42.800
 We have Fields Medal winners and all that stuff.

1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:45.800
 And their names are on walls and we acknowledge their great works.

1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:48.800
 But most of what you hear about in the halls of Stanford

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:51.800
 is about what's happening now and what could happen next.

1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:53.800
 It's really about the future.

1:17:53.800 --> 1:17:56.800
 Whereas when I've spent time at other institutions not to be named,

1:17:56.800 --> 1:18:01.800
 you hear that, but there's a lot of kind of recycling and regurgitation

1:18:01.800 --> 1:18:05.800
 of how wonderful people are based on things they did previously.

1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:08.800
 And the students at Stanford, because of Silicon Valley,

1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:10.800
 sure, they have respect for Nobel Prizes.

1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:13.800
 They're delighted to be learning from and surrounded by all these great minds.

1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:16.800
 But they're mostly interested in what they are going to create.

1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:19.800
 And so I kind of, not kind of,

1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:22.800
 I really like the shift toward possibility

1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:25.800
 as opposed to things that are steeped in tradition.

1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:28.800
 You know, I've never been to high table dinner at Oxford.

1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:30.800
 I'm sure it's a wonderful experience.

1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:34.800
 I'm also not sure what purpose it serves for the world.

1:18:34.800 --> 1:18:37.800
 But I've never been and so I don't know what the conversations are

1:18:37.800 --> 1:18:40.800
 so maybe I'm, you know, speaking out of line here.

1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:42.800
 And now I'm definitely not getting invited.

1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:44.800
 Now you're definitely getting invited.

1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:45.800
 But yeah, I'm with you.

1:18:45.800 --> 1:18:47.800
 The cultures pick the right ones for you.

1:18:47.800 --> 1:18:51.800
 That's why I like MIT, the spirit of it.

1:18:51.800 --> 1:18:54.800
 To me, it's not about the past or the future.

1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:58.800
 It's about just tinkering and having fun building cool stuff.

1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:02.800
 Like the big ambitious projects is there.

1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:06.800
 I mean, maybe more next in the biology and the health side.

1:19:06.800 --> 1:19:08.800
 But like the engineering side,

1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:10.800
 it doesn't matter if this has any impact.

1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:13.800
 Let us build the coolest thing the world has ever built.

1:19:13.800 --> 1:19:16.800
 Whenever I'm in Kendall Square,

1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:18.800
 I've seen they have those buildings there

1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:20.800
 that actually tilt toward the ground.

1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:23.800
 The architecture of MIT is also really impressive.

1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:26.800
 Yeah, he pulled up, Sergei just pulled up,

1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:28.800
 he almost tweet, I'm inspired by curiosity.

1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:29.800
 That is what drives me.

1:19:29.800 --> 1:19:32.800
 So let us expand the scope and scale of consciousness

1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:35.800
 so that we may aspire to understand the universe.

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:38.800
 Those are like three tweets in one, but curiosity, yeah, yeah.

1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:41.800
 Curiosity for its own sake.

1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:43.800
 What's that saying?

1:19:43.800 --> 1:19:45.800
 I think Dorothy Parker said,

1:19:45.800 --> 1:19:48.800
 the cure for boredom is curiosity.

1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:50.800
 There's no cure for curiosity.

1:19:50.800 --> 1:19:52.800
 And you need to celebrate.

1:19:52.800 --> 1:20:00.800
 So let me just briefly mention to my lovely friends at MIT

1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:05.800
 to celebrate different weirdness, to celebrate the weird characters.

1:20:05.800 --> 1:20:14.800
 I sometimes get loving pressure from my lovely friends at MIT

1:20:14.800 --> 1:20:18.800
 to tone down the weirdness a bit.

1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:21.800
 Really? Even from MIT?

1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:24.800
 I'm very fortunate to have a lot of leverage

1:20:24.800 --> 1:20:28.800
 to where I have completely resist the pressure.

1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:31.800
 But I'm very sure that there's young faculty

1:20:31.800 --> 1:20:38.800
 that with that subtle pressure would dissolve them into a puddle of tears.

1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:40.800
 Not, no, no.

1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:41.800
 Oh, they're from Boston, excuse me.

1:20:41.800 --> 1:20:43.800
 They're tougher than that.

1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:46.800
 But it's a slight nudging towards conformity

1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:52.800
 that I think ultimately destroys or at least lessens

1:20:52.800 --> 1:20:57.800
 the power of the kind of science that you can do when you encourage

1:20:57.800 --> 1:21:01.800
 diversity, diversity in all of its forms,

1:21:01.800 --> 1:21:05.800
 including the weirdness of ideas that are out of the box thinkers,

1:21:05.800 --> 1:21:08.800
 including the flamboyant behavior online,

1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:12.800
 how you choose to educate, how you choose to inspire.

1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:14.800
 People talk about freedom of speech,

1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:19.800
 but it's not just freedom of speech to say controversial things.

1:21:19.800 --> 1:21:21.800
 It's also freedom of speech to be weird.

1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:27.800
 Like, if you're for some reason fascinated in, like, you look at Elon Musk,

1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:28.800
 he talks about sex a lot.

1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:31.800
 Let the guy put sex memes up.

1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:32.800
 Who cares?

1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:35.800
 I mean, I feel like Elon can do basically whatever he wants.

1:21:35.800 --> 1:21:37.800
 Right, there's no pressure.

1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:39.800
 But there's a bunch of Elons in the academic world.

1:21:39.800 --> 1:21:41.800
 There's a bunch of Elons.

1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:42.800
 No, actually, sorry.

1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:46.800
 Let me backtrack because the man deserves props.

1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:47.800
 Right, he's unparalleled.

1:21:47.800 --> 1:21:49.800
 He's a CEO of major companies.

1:21:49.800 --> 1:21:54.800
 You better believe there's pressure to behave more like a CEO

1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:59.800
 as opposed to a giggling schoolboy who's posting memes throughout the night.

1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:01.800
 But that is him.

1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:05.800
 And that freedom, that's what freedom looks like.

1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:07.800
 I talked to a lot of CEOs,

1:22:07.800 --> 1:22:13.800
 and a lot of them feel like caged birds

1:22:13.800 --> 1:22:17.800
 who have long ago forgotten how to sing, quite honestly.

1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:20.800
 Like, there's like shareholders,

1:22:20.800 --> 1:22:22.800
 and they come up with excuses for themselves.

1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:25.800
 Here's why I have to be this way, you have to understand.

1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:27.800
 So on, there's PR, there's marketing people,

1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:29.800
 there's lawyers, there's all that kind of stuff.

1:22:29.800 --> 1:22:34.800
 But the final result is the authenticity is suffocated.

1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:38.800
 The beautiful weirdness of a CEO, of a leader,

1:22:38.800 --> 1:22:44.800
 of a creator, of a scientist, all that, that's all gone.

1:22:44.800 --> 1:22:48.800
 Well, Steve Jobs wouldn't have kept his job

1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:52.800
 in acting the way he did in his 20s and 30s in today's climate.

1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:56.800
 But he probably would have updated his protocols, so to speak.

1:22:56.800 --> 1:22:58.800
 A little bit, but maybe...

1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:00.800
 You know, he's screaming at employees.

1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:02.800
 I mean, these are anecdotes, right?

1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:05.800
 I call them anecdote data because people treat them as data,

1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:06.800
 but they're really just anecdotes.

1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:08.800
 We don't know, I wasn't there.

1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:15.800
 But I like the idea of authenticity without oversharing.

1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:18.800
 You're very authentic, but there are aspects to your life

1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:21.800
 that I'm aware of that your audiences will never be aware of,

1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:23.800
 and there are aspects to your life that I'll never be aware of.

1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:25.800
 And so you're still authentic, but...

1:23:25.800 --> 1:23:28.800
 Yeah, wait, which ones are you aware of?

1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:30.800
 People are going to wonder, like,

1:23:30.800 --> 1:23:33.800
 what is the sex dungeon? What is this?

1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:34.800
 No, no, no.

1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:37.800
 But an interesting choice of examples.

1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:43.800
 No, but I think that people lose the careers

1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:46.800
 on the basis of the movement of their thumbs, right?

1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:51.800
 I mean, the chair of psychiatry at Columbia recently lost his position

1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:54.800
 based on a response to a tweet.

1:23:54.800 --> 1:23:55.800
 People can look that up.

1:23:55.800 --> 1:23:58.800
 This is one of the most famous psychiatry departments in the world.

1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:02.800
 And he put something out there that was very insensitive, frankly.

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:05.800
 And everyone that I talked to about it was like,

1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:09.800
 gosh, that was very, very insensitive, not thoughtful at all.

1:24:09.800 --> 1:24:11.800
 And he lost his job, right?

1:24:11.800 --> 1:24:13.800
 Or at least had to step down. I don't know the specifics.

1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:20.800
 So, you know, I think I read someplace that more than half of the job loss

1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:25.800
 due to online behavior is because people were trying to be funny, right?

1:24:25.800 --> 1:24:28.800
 I mean, not everyone can pull off with Tim Dillon.

1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:30.800
 Oh, and by the way, congratulations.

1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:32.800
 I heard that you and Tim just got married.

1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:34.800
 No, no, we didn't just get married. He proposed.

1:24:34.800 --> 1:24:35.800
 Got it, got it, got it.

1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:36.800
 And I said, yes.

1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:39.800
 Right. So, some people can get away.

1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:40.800
 Oh, yeah.

1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:41.800
 Thank you. Thank you, sir.

1:24:41.800 --> 1:24:42.800
 He has that.

1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:43.800
 Has that ready to go.

1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:46.800
 See those 13.3,000 likes, one of those is mine.

1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:51.800
 So, for people who are not aware, one of the days in April tweeted

1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:54.800
 that Tim Dillon asked me to get married and I said, yes.

1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:59.800
 I think Tim said, the wedding will be on 6th Street in Austin.

1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:02.800
 Bring all of your weapons, which of course is totally inappropriate.

1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:05.800
 This is, I was funny.

1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:06.800
 He's a comedian.

1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:11.800
 I was like PG funny and he's goes rated R funny right away.

1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:18.800
 But that said, I mean, if there's anyone, I would like to get married with this.

1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:23.800
 It's that guy and we would do it in Austin and it would be epic.

1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:28.800
 It would be like the wedding from November rain.

1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:31.800
 Mr. and Mrs.

1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:32.800
 Oh, wow.

1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:33.800
 Oh, Mr. and Mr. I apologize.

1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:37.800
 Wow. Yeah. And you broke and you broke tradition with the jacket color.

1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:41.800
 So, it sounds to me that you are a free speech absolutist.

1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:46.800
 I think freedom is really important and that includes letting people who are

1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:52.800
 hateful, letting people who are controversial have a voice on platforms.

1:25:52.800 --> 1:26:00.800
 But it becomes, I'm not sure what exactly to think because I also treasure

1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:04.800
 the quiet voices in the back of the room.

1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:11.800
 And sometimes the assholes silence those voices, meaning by being loud

1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:15.800
 and obnoxious and so on, it pushes away the thoughtful people.

1:26:15.800 --> 1:26:18.800
 So, I'm also a fan of creating communities.

1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:24.800
 Like you should be able to let people kind of build a community that's

1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:33.800
 positive, that's loving or that's constantly trolling or that's super hateful.

1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:36.800
 All those communities should have a place in the world.

1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:44.800
 But like the thing I've noticed is that hate can destroy a community full of hate

1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:48.800
 can destroy a community full of love easier than a community full of love

1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:50.800
 can overtake one with hate.

1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:55.800
 So, you have to kind of, I don't know exactly how but create digital mechanisms

1:26:55.800 --> 1:26:59.800
 that discourage the collision of these communities.

1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:04.800
 They should all have a platform and ability to speak to a large audience.

1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:11.800
 But you have to be careful to protect that little flame of connection that people have.

1:27:11.800 --> 1:27:14.800
 That's the goodness it sounds like.

1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:21.800
 Yeah, I think in any great city like New York, which I love by the way,

1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:25.800
 you want to have a symphony in an opera house and you want some punk rock shows

1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:28.800
 happening on the Lower East Side, you want all of that.

1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:31.800
 You just don't necessarily want them to overlap.

1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:35.800
 In terms of social media and then podcast and engagement,

1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:40.800
 one thing that I decided very early on was to encourage comments and feedback, etc.

1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:44.800
 But I have in my mind what I call classroom rules.

1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:47.800
 You've taught in the university and then you teach in the university

1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:51.800
 and you establish a certain etiquette within the classroom of the kinds of questions

1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:53.800
 that you'll tolerate, right?

1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:55.800
 So, there's always the student that's going to ask a question

1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:58.800
 which is basically a 10 minute monologue about their experience

1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:01.800
 that really isn't a question that pertains to a lot of people.

1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:03.800
 So, you politely discourage that kind of question

1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:07.800
 and you encourage the kinds of questions that are likely to be in the minds of many other students.

1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:09.800
 It's just more efficient that way.

1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:11.800
 Absolutely.

1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:14.800
 You know, I try and respond to comments and I try and respond.

1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:17.800
 But also, you know, there's this also this really interesting question now.

1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:19.800
 If you block people or restrict people,

1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:23.800
 people think that you're somehow afraid of the information that they're posting.

1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:25.800
 But that's often not the case.

1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:27.800
 I'm not in the habit of blocking or restricting too many people.

1:28:27.800 --> 1:28:32.800
 Occasionally, we've had to do it only because of how other people are being treated in the comment section.

1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:36.800
 What I can take and what I think other people deserve to take are two completely different things.

1:28:36.800 --> 1:28:39.800
 David Gaggins, right, who we both know well.

1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:42.800
 I don't know if he still does this, but a few years ago, he posted something like,

1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:47.800
 if people ask him when do you sleep, he would just block them.

1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:49.800
 Because it wasn't consistent with what he was trying to say.

1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:52.800
 Of course, he sleeps, but it's, you know, he's trying to get a particular message out.

1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:58.800
 I think people should just understand that everybody's page is their own to moderate, right?

1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:02.800
 Just like in a classroom, there are certain rules, of course, of institution.

1:29:02.800 --> 1:29:05.800
 But then you establish the etiquette within the context of the kind of class.

1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:10.800
 You know, a class about personality psychology or the psychology of love,

1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:18.800
 you're going to have a very different range of conversations than, you know, a class on, you know, memory and physiology.

1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:24.800
 So, I think social media is a great place for conversation,

1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:27.800
 but it's not necessarily a great place for every kind of conversation.

1:29:27.800 --> 1:29:36.800
 Yeah, and I also should say that people that do get blocked, I never, this is something I do very deliberately, blocked or ignored.

1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:38.800
 I never think poorly of them.

1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:46.800
 I actually explicitly think, if there's somebody that's like saying hateful things about me or whatever, I always think positive thoughts.

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:51.800
 It's not some kind of weird guru thing, but just actually found that as a hack.

1:29:51.800 --> 1:29:55.800
 I think well of them, and that allows me to never think of them again.

1:29:55.800 --> 1:29:57.800
 Like I send them my love.

1:29:57.800 --> 1:30:01.800
 And like I think this is like fascinating human being with a fascinating story.

1:30:01.800 --> 1:30:06.800
 I would love to have time to actually learn about their story, but there's not enough time in the world.

1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:15.800
 And I just think well of them and then I move on and enjoy a delicious meal with people that are close to me and I love and so on and just, and move on.

1:30:15.800 --> 1:30:22.800
 And then never adding to the negativity of like, just even in the privacy of my own mind, thinking a hateful thought towards them.

1:30:22.800 --> 1:30:24.800
 It serves no purpose whatsoever.

1:30:24.800 --> 1:30:26.800
 I love that about you.

1:30:26.800 --> 1:30:28.800
 And I know that what you just said to be true.

1:30:28.800 --> 1:30:36.800
 One of the, I think more toxic things in life is what's called, you know, evacutive projection.

1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:40.800
 When people feel something and they try and evacuate it and project it onto somebody else.

1:30:40.800 --> 1:30:42.800
 Projection is fascinating, right?

1:30:42.800 --> 1:30:45.800
 What you essentially just said is that you don't accept projections.

1:30:45.800 --> 1:30:52.800
 And in fact, you transmute them to put in the language of the Buddhist, you know, you transmute it into positivity.

1:30:52.800 --> 1:30:57.800
 And in that way, you truly neutralize it and transmute it.

1:30:57.800 --> 1:31:10.800
 I think that if people were better understood when they were experiencing or observing evacutive projection, the world would be a much healthier and happier place.

1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:14.800
 But it requires a certain stable internal rudder.

1:31:14.800 --> 1:31:23.800
 And, you know, when we're tired or sick or hungry, excessively hungry, all of us are less good at it.

1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:33.800
 I've been positively struck by the nature of most of the interactions, not just feedback, but my favorite thing as an educator in the classroom, but also on social media,

1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:39.800
 my absolute favorite thing is when the comments about other people's comments are positively reinforcing.

1:31:39.800 --> 1:31:42.800
 So you see people having conversations within the comments.

1:31:42.800 --> 1:31:48.800
 And you realize this is like if you as an educator, again, you know, it's fun to teach and it's fun to talk to the students.

1:31:48.800 --> 1:31:55.800
 But the real pleasure is in walking by a small group of students on campus and hearing them talking about the material.

1:31:55.800 --> 1:31:58.800
 That just fills me with joy.

1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:05.800
 And because what it means is that the ideas are reverberating in their nervous systems and will eventually wick out to others.

1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:07.800
 So it's not just about feedback.

1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:10.800
 It's about a venue for parsing information.

1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:16.800
 So you actually posted that we're going to talk on Instagram and I collected a bunch of the questions, which reminds me of.

1:32:16.800 --> 1:32:26.800
 I have to mention Mike Jones and a question he asked, but also a gift he gave quite a while ago, if it's okay.

1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:28.800
 But first, quick bathroom break.

1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:29.800
 Yes.

1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:33.800
 We're looking at an Instagram page of Mike Jones knife and tool.

1:32:33.800 --> 1:32:35.800
 We should check it out.

1:32:35.800 --> 1:32:43.800
 He gave me a gift from him that is a bad ass butcher knife.

1:32:43.800 --> 1:32:45.800
 Yours is the earth.

1:32:45.800 --> 1:32:48.800
 Dot, dot, dot is from if by Richard Kipling.

1:32:48.800 --> 1:32:57.800
 Yeah, the story of this knife is kind of interesting perhaps to people where it was, I was coming out here to Austin to meet with Lex and it was his birthday.

1:32:57.800 --> 1:32:59.800
 I want to get him a gift, but I didn't know what to get him.

1:32:59.800 --> 1:33:10.800
 And I contacted this guy, Mike Jones, that I learned about through Joe Rogan, because the first, remember in the old days of Joe Rogan, when you go on the episode afterwards, you take a picture with an object.

1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:14.800
 So it was like Elon with a flamethrower or people would have the axe.

1:33:14.800 --> 1:33:18.800
 I picked up this bushwhacker hatchet thing.

1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:20.800
 And I was like, I love this thing.

1:33:20.800 --> 1:33:23.800
 And Joe said, oh, yeah, you should check out Mike Jones's work.

1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:25.800
 He does these beautiful knives.

1:33:25.800 --> 1:33:30.800
 So then I heard your episode with Joe and you recited a poem at the end.

1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:32.800
 It was right after your grandmother died.

1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:39.800
 And there's a line in that poem from if that Mike engraved on that knife for you.

1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:41.800
 So he makes these by hand.

1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:47.800
 I love the old days before the podcast.

1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:48.800
 That's the first appearance.

1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:50.800
 That was the first time on there.

1:33:50.800 --> 1:33:54.800
 And it was a lot of fun in the old studio in Los Angeles.

1:33:54.800 --> 1:33:58.800
 And yeah, Mike makes these beautiful knives.

1:33:58.800 --> 1:33:59.800
 And I have this.

1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:03.800
 I just have a great admiration for crafts people.

1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:05.800
 Do you use it?

1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:07.800
 Do you cut your one meal a day steaks?

1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:11.800
 I feel you taking it with you on your travels.

1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:12.800
 Exactly.

1:34:12.800 --> 1:34:17.800
 I actually used to keep it on the table, but I thought it really intimidated his guests.

1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:18.800
 A little bit.

1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:19.800
 But like...

1:34:19.800 --> 1:34:20.800
 You can put it on their side.

1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:21.800
 Yeah.

1:34:21.800 --> 1:34:22.800
 Right?

1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:23.800
 It's like, oops.

1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:24.800
 Right?

1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:25.800
 What's the story?

1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:30.800
 I mean, yeah, but it's because it's not...

1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:32.800
 It's quite badass, if I may say.

1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:37.800
 So the craftsmanship is obvious, but also it is a knife.

1:34:37.800 --> 1:34:39.800
 It's got some Dexter like qualities to it.

1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:40.800
 Yeah.

1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:43.800
 It looks like it's designed to cleave through a limb.

1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:45.800
 If I had like a family or something where people...

1:34:45.800 --> 1:34:52.800
 There's nothing about this place that softens your kind of sense that this person might not

1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:54.800
 murder me.

1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:56.800
 Let's put it differently.

1:34:56.800 --> 1:34:58.800
 This place could use a woman's touch.

1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:00.800
 It's one way to put it.

1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:01.800
 If it's okay, let me...

1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:08.800
 Because it is a poem I go to often, actually.

1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:12.800
 You mentioned reciting some lyrics, and I'm actually going to go back to that at some

1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:16.800
 point to get a few songs that touch you.

1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:20.800
 But this is one of the things I go to often.

1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:22.800
 I'll read it to remind myself.

1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:30.800
 It's advice from my father to son, and it's a kind of mantra that it's just nice to live

1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:31.800
 by.

1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:33.800
 So if it's okay, let me just use this opportunity one more time.

1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:35.800
 Read If by Rajak Kipling.

1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:40.800
 If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.

1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:45.800
 If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting

1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:52.800
 to, if you can wait to not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies, or

1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:59.800
 being hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise.

1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:04.800
 If you can dream and not make dreams your master, if you can think and not make thoughts

1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:09.800
 your aim, if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just

1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:10.800
 the same.

1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:16.800
 If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken, twisted by naves to make a trap for fools,

1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:22.800
 or watch the things you gave your life to broken and stoop and build them up with worn

1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:23.800
 out tools.

1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:30.800
 If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it all on one turn of pitch and toss,

1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:36.800
 and lose and start again at your beginnings, and never breathe a word about your loss.

1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:42.800
 If you can force your heart to nerve and sin you, to serve your turn long after they're

1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:48.800
 gone, and so hold on when there's nothing in you, except the will which says to them,

1:36:48.800 --> 1:36:49.800
 hold on.

1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:57.800
 If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, and walk with kings nor lose the common touch,

1:36:57.800 --> 1:37:03.800
 if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but none

1:37:03.800 --> 1:37:05.720
 too much.

1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:12.560
 If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run, yours

1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:19.280
 is the earth and everything that's in it, and which is more you'll be a man, my son.

1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:20.280
 Thank you, Andrew.

1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:21.280
 Thank you.

1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:22.280
 Thank you, Mike, for the knife.

1:37:22.280 --> 1:37:23.280
 It's an important call.

1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:24.280
 I don't know.

1:37:24.280 --> 1:37:25.280
 It's an important call.

1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:26.280
 It's been engraved in it.

1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:27.280
 Yeah.

1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:28.280
 It's yours.

1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:31.440
 Yours is the earth and everything that's in it.

1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:37.600
 We toiled over what to engrave, and then finally I just said, Mike, just pick something

1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:39.000
 that speaks to you.

1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:41.240
 You're the craftsman, and so he selected that.

1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:43.280
 There's certain ways to pull yourself in that book.

1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:48.800
 Actually, Carl Deisarath, he wrote the book Projections.

1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:56.800
 One of my favorites, first of all, just as you said, incredible writer, just, I mean,

1:37:56.800 --> 1:38:00.720
 if you wrote fiction, if you wrote those kinds of things, I'm curious to see where he goes

1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:01.720
 with his writing.

1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:02.720
 It's very interesting.

1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:06.640
 I think that book took him 10 years to write, which is vindication for me and for you because

1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:10.240
 we're both supposed to write books and we haven't done it.

1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:11.240
 Yeah.

1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:20.920
 I mean, in some sense, your first book will have decades in it, right?

1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:26.200
 Even if you just take half a year to write it, it's like the first book, like the first

1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:27.200
 album for a musician.

1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:35.240
 I mean, it's a journey, but he uses poems and quotes in there really well.

1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:36.240
 It's a beautiful book.

1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:37.240
 It's a dreamy book.

1:38:37.240 --> 1:38:40.040
 I think when people hear that it's a book about neuroscience, they think they're going

1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:44.360
 to get a textbook or a protocol's book or something, it's nothing like that.

1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:48.440
 But it really is a deep dive into the mind of the psychiatrist and the researcher and

1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:50.560
 so much feeling and compassion.

1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:52.080
 I love that you love poetry.

1:38:52.080 --> 1:39:00.240
 I didn't know that until I saw you on Rogan Read If and I'm not a very rabid consumer

1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:10.400
 of poetry, but I'm a big Wendell Berry fan and I try and read a poem once every few days.

1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:13.480
 Also, I think If is a tough act to follow.

1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:14.480
 Oh, yeah.

1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:15.480
 Yeah.

1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:16.480
 Oh, yeah.

1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:21.440
 I mean, that's the richness and the, I mean, you said every third line in there is something

1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:27.920
 that you would, you know, you'd consider your life well lived if you said that, right?

1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:31.560
 What about the preparation for the solo podcast?

1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:36.680
 You said you listened to certain songs, you know, you sing or recite the lyrics to certain

1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:37.680
 songs.

1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:40.800
 Is there ones that kind of come to mind that are interesting?

1:39:40.800 --> 1:39:45.400
 Yeah, I've always been very lyrics driven and I don't understand music.

1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:47.720
 I've talked to Rick about this, I think I've talked to you about this a little bit.

1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:54.880
 I don't really understand, I mean, I can hear music and like it, but I don't really

1:39:54.880 --> 1:39:57.840
 understand the structure of it, but lyrics make a lot of sense to me.

1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:00.520
 But does it touch your soul music or is it the lyrics?

1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:01.520
 It's the lyrics.

1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:02.520
 It's not the instrumentals.

1:40:02.520 --> 1:40:06.160
 So I'm a huge Joe Strummer fan and I'm going to lose punk points for saying this, but I'm

1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:07.160
 not a Clash fan.

1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:08.160
 Oh, okay.

1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:09.160
 Right.

1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:10.600
 So he obviously is best known for the Clash.

1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:15.480
 Most Clash songs start off great and then after about 30 seconds, at least in my mind

1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:21.240
 just kind of disintegrate into a bunch of mush, whereas Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros, which

1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:25.080
 is what he did as an adult, you know, later.

1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:28.840
 And some of his solo work, he actually, Rick produced some work that he did with Johnny

1:40:28.840 --> 1:40:29.840
 Cash.

1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:34.320
 You know, Rick pulled Johnny Cash out of essentially out of retirement and had him do his albums

1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:36.160
 before he died.

1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:41.040
 And so anything that Strummer did, there's a favorite song of mine by Strummer, it's

1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:43.040
 called Burning Lights.

1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:46.520
 You can find it, there is an album now where you can find it or Tennessee Rain or some

1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:50.000
 of these things that he did, which are a little bit more folky, so not really punk.

1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.320
 So I love that song.

1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:55.960
 Bunch of songs by Rancid that I love, you know.

1:40:55.960 --> 1:41:01.920
 And then if I listen to instrumentals, I do, I'll listen to classical piano.

1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:06.160
 Some dreams are made for children, but it's not going to sound good as a poem.

1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:07.160
 They can play this.

1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:08.160
 People can play the song.

1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:09.160
 Play the song.

1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:10.160
 Okay.

1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:11.160
 Yeah.

1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:15.080
 I mean, because it has to be something, Joe's voice is what makes the song.

1:41:15.080 --> 1:41:16.080
 Got it.

1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:21.200
 Joe's voice is what makes the song, but yeah, that song Burning Lights from I hired a contract

1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:22.200
 killer.

1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:23.200
 I don't know.

1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:24.200
 The lyrics are pretty good.

1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:25.200
 They're pretty good.

1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:26.200
 I mean, Joe is an amazing writer, right?

1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:30.120
 You know, I'm also a big Bob Dylan fan, Glenn Gould for classical piano.

1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:34.480
 He was at Asperger's, you know, and actually I think you can hear him grunting.

1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:36.920
 He had a Tourette's like Tick.

1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:40.760
 And I learned about Glenn Gould from Oliver Sacks.

1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:42.120
 So I'll listen to any number of things.

1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:43.120
 It depends on my mood.

1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:46.320
 If I'm feeling a little more tired and I need to be amped up, I'll listen to something

1:41:46.320 --> 1:41:48.160
 that's a little louder and faster.

1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:53.360
 If I'm feeling kind of keyed up and I need to bring the cadence down a little bit, then

1:41:53.360 --> 1:41:56.800
 I'll listen to something a little mellower or poppier.

1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:03.040
 I love bands like, yeah, I'm a big fan of this British pop band called James.

1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:07.120
 There's like 20 bands named James, but this one, you know, and again, I lose punk points

1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:09.480
 for saying that, but they're amazing.

1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:15.200
 I think you've accumulated enough points where you can afford to lose a few.

1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:21.440
 But in any case, yeah, music and poetry are, they're the subconscious, right?

1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:26.520
 I mean, if you think about a Bob Dylan song or a really good strummer song or a poem,

1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:30.760
 the words don't mean anything when read linearly, but they make you feel something.

1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:33.040
 They're tapping into the subconscious.

1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:34.280
 That's really what they're doing.

1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:42.400
 They're pulling on neural threads of emotion based on either timbre or cadence or something

1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:45.680
 that's independent of the word structure.

1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:48.600
 And that to me is the beauty of music and poetry.

1:42:48.600 --> 1:42:55.120
 I often say Johnny Cash's version of Hurt, that I say would be my favorite song ever.

1:42:55.120 --> 1:42:56.720
 We did a nine inch nail song.

1:42:56.720 --> 1:42:57.720
 He did.

1:42:57.720 --> 1:42:58.720
 I think Rick produced that.

1:42:58.720 --> 1:42:59.720
 He produced it.

1:42:59.720 --> 1:43:00.720
 Pretty sure he produced that.

1:43:00.720 --> 1:43:01.720
 Yeah, he produced it.

1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:08.440
 I mean, like the Rick produced the, he pulled Johnny Cash out from a dark place to produce

1:43:08.440 --> 1:43:15.480
 something that, I mean, when you look back as one of the great things ever in music,

1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:22.000
 which are these like haunting covers of certain songs and originals.

1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:28.840
 Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer did a version of Redemption song together that is, that

1:43:28.840 --> 1:43:35.680
 Rick produced, which is on loop in my house sometimes, you know, for hours and hours.

1:43:35.680 --> 1:43:38.880
 That song is fascinating, Bob Marley's song.

1:43:38.880 --> 1:43:41.280
 Song by Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer.

1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:45.360
 You know, sometimes I think what it would be to be a fly on the wall when these guys

1:43:45.360 --> 1:43:46.360
 were doing this stuff.

1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:48.920
 These songs of freedom.

1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:58.360
 There's certain songs where you're like, it elicit an emotion that's unlike anything

1:43:58.360 --> 1:43:59.360
 else.

1:43:59.360 --> 1:44:02.080
 I mean, I was, I was trying to figure that out with, with Rick too.

1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:05.760
 Like there's certain songs that make you want to pull out over to the side of the road

1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:12.920
 and just weep or just get inspired to just get shit done or all of those kinds of things

1:44:12.920 --> 1:44:17.600
 or remember your family, the people you've lost, all that kind of stuff.

1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:23.120
 I mean, hurt, hurt myself today to see if I still feel.

1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:28.560
 There's certain songs that I've loved so much that I actually won't play them during

1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:34.600
 a relationship until the relationship passes a certain duration because if you start sharing

1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:38.160
 in those experiences with somebody in the room and it starts to become associated with

1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:43.920
 the relationship, you brading it in with the dopamine of love and that relationship ends.

1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:45.600
 The song is forever tainted.

1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:49.400
 There are certain songs that I will never play in the company of anybody else.

1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:50.400
 They're mine.

1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:59.080
 I just, it's too risky to, to give those up and, you know, be, and I think that there's

1:44:59.080 --> 1:45:00.080
 like levels.

1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:01.080
 They're levels.

1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:02.080
 Right.

1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:03.080
 Exactly.

1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:05.400
 We'll leave it at that.

1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:06.400
 Yeah.

1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:15.000
 And the interesting thing about this kind of preparing for the solo episode, just interacting

1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:23.480
 with Rick about that process of preparation and cause you mentioned with interviews, by

1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:25.000
 the way, are you do solo solo?

1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000
 Are you the only one in the room or?

1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:33.440
 No, I've, well, it used to be Rob, my producer who, I should say, you know, he's really the

1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:35.280
 person behind the podcast.

1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:37.600
 I mean, we're, first of all, we're equal partners and everything.

1:45:37.600 --> 1:45:40.280
 You're just a pretty face.

1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:44.960
 We're just, and I'm aging and not to, not to, I'm actually really, I like, I like

1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:45.960
 aging.

1:45:45.960 --> 1:45:46.960
 It's weird.

1:45:46.960 --> 1:45:50.240
 A lot of people like friends with David Sinclair and it's all about not aging.

1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:52.440
 I don't want to live past 90, 95.

1:45:52.440 --> 1:45:56.240
 I'm just trying to get as much done as I can in this short life and do it right and with

1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:00.320
 integrity and heart and accuracy, you know.

1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:02.320
 And you like the stages.

1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:03.320
 Oh, yeah.

1:46:03.320 --> 1:46:09.680
 If you read Erickson's stages of development, you realize that every stage of life is a set

1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:13.000
 of neural circuits trying to resolve a problem.

1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:18.440
 And if you're going to try and avoid that progression, sure, you might live longer.

1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:24.480
 But you know, it's sort of like saying, like, do you want to go win the high school jujitsu

1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:25.480
 championship?

1:46:25.480 --> 1:46:28.640
 No, you graduated high school a long time ago, right?

1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:34.920
 So I actually look forward to the future, even if it means that I'm starting to shift.

1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:36.960
 I think that my biology will shift.

1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:37.960
 You know, I'll fight that.

1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:41.080
 I try and take good care of myself, but I don't want to get sick.

1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:46.560
 I don't want to suffer who does, but I'm embracing this whole developmental arc.

1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:49.880
 I mean, we're not children and then adults.

1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:52.920
 Our entire life is one long developmental arc.

1:46:52.920 --> 1:46:57.520
 And if you fail to embrace that, you fail to extract the richness of what it is to be

1:46:57.520 --> 1:46:58.760
 a human being.

1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:05.720
 So in any event, I record Rob is in the room.

1:47:05.720 --> 1:47:09.760
 I'll sometimes stop and ask him for feedback if I feel like something's not landing right.

1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:11.640
 So he gives, if it's clear, he'll let me know.

1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:12.840
 If it's not clear, he'll let me know.

1:47:12.840 --> 1:47:13.840
 Excuse me.

1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:15.640
 And then, you know, Costello used to be in the room.

1:47:15.640 --> 1:47:21.640
 The early days of the podcast, which weren't that long ago, he's snoring at my feet and

1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:25.000
 farting and smelling up the room and we're all just kind of like gasping for air.

1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:26.000
 He's a bulldog.

1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:27.000
 That's what they do.

1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:30.240
 With him gone, it changed, you know, the whole thing changed.

1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:32.840
 There will be another dog soon.

1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:38.400
 And as you know, I've been moving through that grief process, but having him there gave

1:47:38.400 --> 1:47:41.720
 me a levity that I miss.

1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:43.240
 But in my mind, he's still there.

1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:44.240
 Yeah, he's still there.

1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:45.240
 Yeah, he's still there.

1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:49.280
 So, and, you know, in time, there'll be another dog and who knows, you know, maybe there'll

1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:54.640
 be a dog and a couple infants running around, but that would be more distracting.

1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:59.680
 But there's no podcast that exists just because of the podcaster.

1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:00.680
 This is true for Joe.

1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:03.000
 This is true for your podcast for me.

1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:05.480
 It's not just a staff of people to post stuff.

1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:07.320
 That's just the top level contour.

1:48:07.320 --> 1:48:11.920
 There's the constant feedback and iteration of what you want it to become.

1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:16.920
 And trying to hold on to something that's essential along the way because everything

1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:20.600
 has to evolve, but you can't lose the essence of something.

1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:26.960
 Anytime a company or brand or a course or a scientist has done that, it just ends up

1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:27.960
 terrible.

1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:31.520
 It just becomes like a senator version of itself.

1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:39.480
 So to Rick is very, the power of the people in the room is great to inspire and to destroy.

1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:44.560
 So you have to be extremely careful with the selection of people that are in the room.

1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:47.320
 To me, I never really thought of it that way.

1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:51.120
 I thought only positive things can happen.

1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:52.120
 By adding people in the room.

1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:53.120
 By adding people in the room.

1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:56.600
 Oh, I think if there were an audience in the room, well, you know, someday I'd love to

1:48:56.600 --> 1:48:59.400
 do a live podcast with you.

1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:03.280
 I saw you're doing like a couple of live things, which is great that you're paving

1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:04.280
 the way there.

1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:05.280
 Well, we did one.

1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:11.760
 I went up to University of British Columbia and did a lecture on a college campus and

1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:16.280
 one of the more gratifying things that happens is this kid in his early 20s, I think stood

1:49:16.280 --> 1:49:19.720
 up and said, you know, I've never been on a college campus.

1:49:19.720 --> 1:49:22.240
 I didn't think I could go on to a college campus.

1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:24.400
 And now I still ring in my mind, whoever you are out there.

1:49:24.400 --> 1:49:27.720
 That meant so much to me because I was like, yes, there was something about that to me.

1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:31.560
 I was like, OK, this it made sense to come all the way up here and do this in person

1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:34.960
 because you can get out to a lot more people online.

1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:37.600
 Public speaking events, it's not like it's that lucrative or anything.

1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:41.800
 I mean, unless you're whatever, you're a famous celebrity or politician or something.

1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:45.200
 I'm sure there are people that do well with it, but that's not what it's about for us.

1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:49.440
 It's really about being able to connect with people in a different venue and for interactions

1:49:49.440 --> 1:49:50.440
 like that.

1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:55.560
 I don't know how many of them we will do, but I'm curious to see how it goes.

1:49:55.560 --> 1:49:58.040
 But I'd love to do a podcast with you.

1:49:58.040 --> 1:49:59.400
 Is it energizing?

1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:07.880
 My fear is the fear of the introvert is that I don't know if I can handle so much love

1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:12.080
 and fascinating people all around.

1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:14.080
 It's like, I don't know.

1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:16.120
 Well, we'll invite a few haters, too.

1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:20.160
 Well, yes, but I love the haters, too, but I don't know.

1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:23.080
 It makes me nervous because Jordan Peterson is currently on tour.

1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:25.440
 I got a chance to hang out with him when he was here.

1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:28.160
 He does a lot of live speaking.

1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:29.160
 Yeah.

1:50:29.160 --> 1:50:34.440
 He's not on tour where he does every other day, but he doesn't have any small kids at

1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:35.440
 home anymore.

1:50:35.440 --> 1:50:36.440
 No.

1:50:36.440 --> 1:50:37.440
 So, yeah, you should do it before you have a fan.

1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:38.440
 That's also exhausting.

1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:39.440
 Yeah, you're touring.

1:50:39.440 --> 1:50:43.640
 I'm just speaking from an athlete perspective.

1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:50.200
 If you're Mick Jagger with the Rolling Stones, it's just physically, I mean, you have to

1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:56.800
 speak potentially for two hours, then offstage, like hanging out with people.

1:50:56.800 --> 1:50:57.800
 It's a lot.

1:50:57.800 --> 1:50:58.800
 It's a lot of hours.

1:50:58.800 --> 1:51:04.800
 It's a lot of hours to stay focused, to keep finding your place of calmness and excitement.

1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:08.200
 Well, and you're staying in hotels, your circadian rhythm is disrupted.

1:51:08.200 --> 1:51:11.000
 You're not getting cold and sauna and your workout every day.

1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:13.320
 Your food isn't optimal.

1:51:13.320 --> 1:51:17.520
 I think done in patches, I could enjoy it because it's fun to meet people from different

1:51:17.520 --> 1:51:18.520
 places.

1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:23.600
 There's a public lecture in Copenhagen for the Lundbeck Foundation in June, June 3rd.

1:51:23.600 --> 1:51:26.880
 And that one is particularly gratifying for me because the Lundbeck Foundation is an

1:51:26.880 --> 1:51:27.880
 academic foundation.

1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:31.360
 So, the fact that, and then so when they invited, I asked, you know, do you want me to talk

1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:34.000
 about what my lab does or do you want me to talk about the stuff on the podcast?

1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.080
 They're like, no, no, not your lab.

1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:40.000
 We want to hear about this health stuff and the stuff that we cover on the podcast.

1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:44.320
 So that was amusing to me and tells me that, you know, things are changing.

1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:50.280
 I think 2020 and 2021 revealed a lot of things about people to ourselves.

1:51:50.280 --> 1:51:55.800
 But one thing that it made very clear is that there's an enormous appetite for tools for

1:51:55.800 --> 1:51:59.680
 mental and physical health, but also understanding about science and how science is done.

1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:03.920
 So thanks to you, again, I'm not saying this to flatter you, it's true gratitude.

1:52:03.920 --> 1:52:07.160
 There is now a runway for scientists to talk to people.

1:52:07.160 --> 1:52:11.040
 I mean, you had the, I always forget this guy's name, the virus guy from Columbia.

1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:12.200
 It's in Reckon yellow.

1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:13.200
 Yeah.

1:52:13.200 --> 1:52:14.200
 Amazing, right?

1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:19.240
 I mean, the controversy around all the stuff of 2020 and 2021, I mean, he is an encyclopedia

1:52:19.240 --> 1:52:21.280
 of all things, virology.

1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:22.280
 Yeah.

1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:26.480
 Now, people should listen to his podcast this week and virology is also an incredible

1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:28.280
 lecturer and educator.

1:52:28.280 --> 1:52:30.400
 It's, it's fascinating.

1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:31.400
 It's fascinating.

1:52:31.400 --> 1:52:32.400
 Yeah.

1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:37.880
 When people take, again, that leap of putting all that education online, that's non controversial

1:52:37.880 --> 1:52:38.880
 at all.

1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:41.880
 It's, it's like everybody there.

1:52:41.880 --> 1:52:47.680
 People should go listen to him for the most part in terms of, at his best, at least, there's

1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:48.680
 no politics in it.

1:52:48.680 --> 1:52:51.720
 There's, there's, there's not, no, he's, he's a virus jockey.

1:52:51.720 --> 1:52:57.920
 He likes playing around with bacteria and viruses and, but that said, molecular biology,

1:52:57.920 --> 1:53:00.600
 we all say stuff carelessly all the time.

1:53:00.600 --> 1:53:04.840
 So he gets in a bit of trouble on some of the things you've said about like dismissing

1:53:04.840 --> 1:53:09.440
 lab leak theory, like there's no way he dismisses that.

1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:17.720
 But not, he's not making, like folks, there's a difference when you say stuff like off the

1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:23.440
 cuff and when you say stuff that's like courtier principles and you've thought about it for

1:53:23.440 --> 1:53:29.720
 a very long time, you're talking for, for hundreds of hours and you can just say stuff.

1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:33.120
 You could just say your opinions.

1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:34.620
 Will Smith slapped.

1:53:34.620 --> 1:53:37.200
 I was wondering, okay, wait, how long have we been recording?

1:53:37.200 --> 1:53:40.320
 I was wondering how long it was going to take us before someone talked about Ukraine.

1:53:40.320 --> 1:53:41.320
 No, no, Will Smith.

1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:43.200
 I was wondering whether or not we'd make it the end.

1:53:43.200 --> 1:53:45.000
 I had it planned.

1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:46.880
 I was literally in the back of my mind.

1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:50.760
 I had it planned that at the end, if we didn't talk about the Will Smith, Chris Rock thing

1:53:50.760 --> 1:53:52.960
 that I was going to say, it's amazing.

1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:58.000
 This is the first conversation to happen in a long time where it wasn't mentioned.

1:53:58.000 --> 1:53:59.000
 Oh, no.

1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:00.000
 Here we go.

1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:01.000
 No, not pulling.

1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:02.000
 We don't need to see.

1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:03.000
 We don't need to see.

1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:09.080
 It revealed some interesting things about human beings, impulse control and lack thereof.

1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:13.880
 But you know, oh my goodness, Chris Rock has a material for the rest of his career.

1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:14.880
 Yeah.

1:54:14.880 --> 1:54:21.440
 I think he's not short on material, but I do, see, if I knew what I wanted to tweet,

1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:25.160
 if I knew your lot to just slab comedians, my conversation with Tim Dillon would have

1:54:25.160 --> 1:54:27.400
 gone very differently.

1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:29.640
 People just being humans.

1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:33.640
 There's so much fascinating human nature on display there.

1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:39.800
 It's also in terms of becoming a topic that a lot of people are talking about versus the

1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:44.960
 war in Ukraine, for example, is also fascinating to watch, like just these kind of news cycles

1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:45.960
 moving through.

1:54:45.960 --> 1:54:53.160
 Well, I think if I may, I started to interrupt, but anytime we observe something very limbic,

1:54:53.160 --> 1:54:59.800
 very emotional, we generally can empathize somewhat, right?

1:54:59.800 --> 1:55:02.280
 We all know what it's like to feel angry, we all know what it's like to feel ashamed,

1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:04.800
 we all know what it's like to feel shocked.

1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:09.480
 Images of war are, for most people, very hard to relate to.

1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:15.600
 We see it, there are these images and they're very traumatic and challenging to look at

1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:16.600
 at times.

1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:20.800
 And yet most people have no idea what it feels like to be shot at or what it feels like to

1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:27.320
 have your home destroyed or what it feels like to be an aggressor in that way.

1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:32.000
 So I think that people naturally orient towards things that feel familiar to them, even though

1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:33.680
 the circumstances are different.

1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:39.200
 And people also forget, they look at these celebrities that's just like looking at criticism

1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:40.200
 of Will Smith.

1:55:40.200 --> 1:55:43.680
 You forget that they're human too.

1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:48.200
 That's one of the most surprising things for me, having done this podcast and met celebrities

1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:52.280
 and stuff like that, they're human, they're all human.

1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:56.040
 That's inspiring to me, like some of these great folks that have won Nobel Prize and

1:55:56.040 --> 1:55:59.320
 built some cool things, they're just human, like the rest of us.

1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:03.160
 Well, and if you look at actors and actresses, I mean, there's some amazing ones, right?

1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:09.600
 And who also do well in their outside life, but their careers were built on the business

1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:13.080
 of pretending to be other people.

1:56:13.080 --> 1:56:19.640
 And that's got to distort maybe positively, but also just, let's be honest, what it is,

1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:24.240
 the neuroplasticity there, the changes in the areas of the brain that represent personality

1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:27.840
 have to be quite different for somebody who pretends to be lots of different personalities

1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:29.040
 and gets paid for it.

1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:33.680
 You're working the reward system into the system of self identity.

1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:41.800
 And you have to imagine that that can really contort somebody's neurology in ways that

1:56:41.800 --> 1:56:46.520
 maybe they are not as, maybe they are not in touch with reality in the same way that

1:56:46.520 --> 1:56:47.520
 we are.

1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:53.240
 Remember earlier we were talking about neurotic versus psychotic, they may be more borderline

1:56:53.240 --> 1:56:56.200
 in their kind of ground state than we think.

1:56:56.200 --> 1:57:00.000
 And so I'm actually impressed anytime there's a celebrity who doesn't have a messed up life.

1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:06.120
 I'm like, oh wow, finally somebody who's managed to maintain some semblance, at least from

1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:08.320
 the outside of normalcy.

1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:14.280
 So first of all, I can empathize with the actions that Will Smith did, right?

1:57:14.280 --> 1:57:18.680
 They're not, I think they're kind of not kind of, they're just shitty.

1:57:18.680 --> 1:57:23.440
 You should probably talk privately man to man, not, because otherwise it's like a dramatic

1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:24.440
 display.

1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:27.680
 It's like, it's almost like you are a fake act, you're acting.

1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:29.680
 Well, there are all these questions, right?

1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:33.280
 I mean, obviously it was aggressive at some level.

1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:36.120
 There's this question of whether or not it was impulsive.

1:57:36.120 --> 1:57:37.440
 I think most people feel yes.

1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:41.120
 There was a question, there was a protective nature of it because he was doing it to, you

1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:44.000
 know, apparently in defense.

1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:50.840
 But then there's also the context, he lost touch with the context, right?

1:57:50.840 --> 1:57:57.000
 Whereas Chris Rock basically gets, there's the possible critique that he went too far,

1:57:57.000 --> 1:57:59.160
 that's gonna be in the eye of the beholder.

1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:02.800
 But then, and depending on how you view comedy and jokes, but then there's also the fact

1:58:02.800 --> 1:58:06.160
 that he took that slap and then just snapped right back so much so that people thought

1:58:06.160 --> 1:58:07.520
 maybe it was faked.

1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:10.120
 He also waited with his hands behind his back.

1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:11.120
 That's just natural.

1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:12.200
 He likes to stand like that.

1:58:12.200 --> 1:58:22.880
 I mean, I got to a little bit of a story here to connect to what Chris Rock did.

1:58:22.880 --> 1:58:28.720
 Like, I wish, what Chris Rock did in terms of just taking this slap and keep going, first

1:58:28.720 --> 1:58:33.920
 of all, just props for somebody that's able to maintain cool in that situation for the

1:58:33.920 --> 1:58:34.920
 most part.

1:58:34.920 --> 1:58:36.920
 I think I'd like watched it once.

1:58:36.920 --> 1:58:40.640
 You only have to be alive on this planet to see it.

1:58:40.640 --> 1:58:42.000
 You can't avoid seeing it.

1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:50.720
 I wish at that afterwards, he would sort of say something loving and kind to Will Smith

1:58:50.720 --> 1:58:56.880
 and his wife and then hit him real hard, lean into the joke.

1:58:56.880 --> 1:59:01.240
 But there, I think in hockey, they call taking a number of a friend who plays hockey and there's

1:59:01.240 --> 1:59:05.720
 this idea that if someone checks you really badly in one game, you don't go and check

1:59:05.720 --> 1:59:06.720
 them again.

1:59:06.720 --> 1:59:07.720
 You don't get into a fight.

1:59:07.720 --> 1:59:12.240
 But three games later, you blade them in the shin.

1:59:12.240 --> 1:59:20.280
 So the ability to defer and to handle it in whatever fashion one feels is appropriate.

1:59:20.280 --> 1:59:24.240
 They're probably also friends and all those kinds of things that they respect each other.

1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:26.000
 So he probably didn't.

1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:27.680
 But there's a comedian instinct.

1:59:27.680 --> 1:59:33.240
 I saw this, I was in an open mic here in Texas.

1:59:33.240 --> 1:59:34.240
 I won't say where.

1:59:34.240 --> 1:59:35.240
 There's many open mics.

1:59:35.240 --> 1:59:36.480
 Have you gone to a few of these?

1:59:36.480 --> 1:59:37.480
 These are pretty fast.

1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:38.480
 Yeah.

1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:39.480
 No.

1:59:39.480 --> 1:59:44.160
 So there is more sort of a rougher kind of...

1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:45.160
 Yeah.

1:59:45.160 --> 1:59:46.160
 You've been hanging out in like West Texas.

1:59:46.160 --> 1:59:47.160
 Yeah.

1:59:47.160 --> 1:59:48.160
 Exactly.

1:59:48.160 --> 1:59:49.160
 Austin's too tame for Lex.

1:59:49.160 --> 1:59:50.800
 So he's like head to West Texas.

1:59:50.800 --> 1:59:51.800
 Exactly.

1:59:51.800 --> 1:59:54.640
 I put on a cowboy hat and instantly I became a cowboy.

1:59:54.640 --> 1:59:56.560
 I've been talking like a cowboy.

1:59:56.560 --> 1:59:59.080
 I mean, I belong out there in the desert.

1:59:59.080 --> 2:00:03.080
 He's gone from eating meat and athletic greens to rattlesnakes.

2:00:03.080 --> 2:00:04.080
 You're rattlesnakes.

2:00:04.080 --> 2:00:05.080
 Exactly.

2:00:05.080 --> 2:00:06.080
 Right.

2:00:06.080 --> 2:00:07.080
 No.

2:00:07.080 --> 2:00:11.120
 There was an open mic late at night and I was one of the only people in the audience.

2:00:11.120 --> 2:00:15.440
 There's a couple of drunk folks, a few drunk folks.

2:00:15.440 --> 2:00:23.800
 One of them was a couple and like bikers, like with helmets and so on, a guy and a girl.

2:00:23.800 --> 2:00:31.720
 And then the comedian, the open mic comedian, did a joke about people who wear helmets.

2:00:31.720 --> 2:00:34.960
 I don't know if it was on purpose or not, but he did the joke.

2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:39.160
 And then the guy about women who wear helmets.

2:00:39.160 --> 2:00:41.800
 And the guy, this exact same situation.

2:00:41.800 --> 2:00:44.280
 The guy stood up, walked up to him.

2:00:44.280 --> 2:00:45.280
 There was no slap.

2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:48.800
 It's so interesting because this happened before the Will Smith thing.

2:00:48.800 --> 2:00:59.800
 He walked up to the comedian and said, I think he pointed his finger down and told him to

2:00:59.800 --> 2:01:03.040
 stop or something like that and then sat down.

2:01:03.040 --> 2:01:05.920
 This is an audience of like six people.

2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:10.560
 And at midnight around then, there's nobody, no security, nothing.

2:01:10.560 --> 2:01:11.560
 In Texas.

2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:12.560
 In Texas.

2:01:12.560 --> 2:01:13.560
 Which implies.

2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:24.560
 The guy was the energy drunk, but also a biker and what he felt, his lady was now attacked

2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:27.240
 by the comedian with his words.

2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:34.880
 And the comedian was a kind of out of shape, small guy, so it's not threatening at all

2:01:34.880 --> 2:01:37.280
 and probably in trouble.

2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:41.480
 And the comedian, after he sat down, he looked a little bit scared.

2:01:41.480 --> 2:01:47.320
 He paced back and forth and then he did the joke again.

2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:48.820
 Wow.

2:01:48.820 --> 2:01:57.280
 And I was sitting and I started, I leaned back and I just did this like because that is comedy.

2:01:57.280 --> 2:02:03.280
 And the guy was getting angrier and angrier and he just sat there.

2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:09.520
 And the comedian went on for a couple more minutes and then did another bad joke, but

2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:12.760
 another joke about how much just like he leaned into it.

2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:17.360
 If you go to a small comedy club, open a mic or otherwise, you're in the shooting gallery.

2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:21.960
 Like you're basically there teed up as a pin to get it.

2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:24.400
 We went and saw Andrew Scholes in San Francisco.

2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:25.400
 In San Francisco.

2:02:25.400 --> 2:02:26.400
 Yeah, it was hilarious.

2:02:26.400 --> 2:02:27.400
 It was amazing.

2:02:27.400 --> 2:02:32.600
 I mean, he's just masterful in his ability to command an audience.

2:02:32.600 --> 2:02:37.440
 But I felt for the people up front, but no sympathy either because you buy tickets to

2:02:37.440 --> 2:02:44.160
 sit up front at a Scholes show, you're gonna get it, but he was very loving.

2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:45.160
 And funny.

2:02:45.160 --> 2:02:46.160
 First of all, funny.

2:02:46.160 --> 2:02:52.960
 The funniness really helps you, but the ethic of the comedian is like that fearlessness.

2:02:52.960 --> 2:03:00.800
 What I really liked is like the danger, there's risk to comedy and there's also consequences.

2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:01.800
 Have you watched that show?

2:03:01.800 --> 2:03:02.800
 What is it?

2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:04.320
 The Marvelous Miss Macell Show?

2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:05.800
 It's really good.

2:03:05.800 --> 2:03:09.280
 I watched a few of them, guilty pleasure there.

2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:17.920
 She plays a comic in the mid 1960s in New York and there's a character that somewhat resembles

2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:18.920
 Lenny Bruce.

2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:24.040
 It's sort of meant to be Lenny Bruce and they're always getting arrested and this kind

2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:25.040
 of thing.

2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:26.040
 I think I learned about it from Joe.

2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:27.160
 Anyway, the writing's great.

2:03:27.160 --> 2:03:29.560
 It's very funny.

2:03:29.560 --> 2:03:36.920
 But yeah, comedy is designed to push boundaries and to say the thing that other people aren't

2:03:36.920 --> 2:03:38.440
 feel they can't say.

2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:39.440
 Not something in science.

2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:43.400
 Science you're supposed to etiquette is a big part of how you communicate ideas.

2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:46.400
 It's about constraining communication.

2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:52.240
 This is something I mean, I confess on the podcast that in the goals of making it clear,

2:03:52.240 --> 2:03:57.480
 interesting, surprising and actionable, you have to constrain the amount and the style

2:03:57.480 --> 2:03:58.480
 of information.

2:03:58.480 --> 2:04:02.800
 Otherwise, it becomes something else altogether, right?

2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:09.160
 I saw Sander Prachai, Google CEO, said that he likes the thing you mentioned, not the

2:04:09.160 --> 2:04:15.920
 Yoga Nidra, but the NSDR, Nonsleep Deep Rest podcast over meditation.

2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:17.120
 I don't know if you saw that.

2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:18.120
 I saw that.

2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:19.120
 Yeah.

2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:20.120
 Yeah.

2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:21.120
 Why?

2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:22.120
 What do you think that is?

2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:23.120
 What do you think the difference is?

2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:27.720
 Yeah, so Nonsleep Deep Rest, NSDR is an acronym that I coined because it encompasses a lot

2:04:27.720 --> 2:04:33.280
 of practices that are not meditation per se, but that bring the brain and body into a state

2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:35.040
 of relaxation and focus.

2:04:35.040 --> 2:04:37.200
 So hypnosis is one variant of NSDR.

2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:38.600
 There are other variants of NSDR.

2:04:38.600 --> 2:04:40.880
 You can just look these up and you'll find them.

2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:48.080
 And I think that they've caught on and that the CEO of Google is an avid practitioner

2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:54.240
 of NSDR because it has this amazing ability to reset your energy levels and focus, whereas

2:04:54.240 --> 2:04:58.880
 with meditation, many people find meditation hard and part of the reason they find it hard

2:04:58.880 --> 2:05:00.840
 is that it requires focus.

2:05:00.840 --> 2:05:04.480
 NSDR is a state which is very calm and relaxing.

2:05:04.480 --> 2:05:05.680
 You don't have to work too hard.

2:05:05.680 --> 2:05:09.320
 You're just listening to a script, whereas most forms of meditation, not all, but most

2:05:09.320 --> 2:05:15.240
 forms of meditation involve cranking up the activity in your prefrontal cortex and trying

2:05:15.240 --> 2:05:20.320
 to see your thoughts as opposed to thinking your thoughts or focus on your breath, but

2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:23.440
 then third personing yourself in some respect.

2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:24.440
 And that's work.

2:05:24.440 --> 2:05:28.040
 And so many people who meditate quite intensely feel more exhausted.

2:05:28.040 --> 2:05:32.880
 Now, that doesn't mean that meditation doesn't have any utility, but it's distinctly different

2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:34.120
 than NSDR.

2:05:34.120 --> 2:05:37.600
 And I think that people are working, certainly the CEO of Google, I have to imagine, is working

2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:39.600
 very hard and using his forebrain.

2:05:39.600 --> 2:05:43.760
 If he's going to have 20 or 30 minutes to take a break, he should, and I think this

2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:47.280
 is what he's doing, he should go out for a jog and not listen to anything and just kind

2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:52.400
 of let his mind wander or sit there in a chair and just zone out or do NSDR.

2:05:52.400 --> 2:05:57.680
 The problem is, people are not that good at shifting states.

2:05:57.680 --> 2:06:02.560
 We are all actually pretty good at, even people with severe ADHD, we had an episode about

2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:07.560
 this, can become hyper focused on things that they actually enjoy.

2:06:07.560 --> 2:06:11.760
 Because dope and most of the drugs designed to treat ADHD are drugs that increase the

2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:12.760
 levels of dopamine.

2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:15.400
 So when you like something, there's dopamine release and you can focus.

2:06:15.400 --> 2:06:18.760
 It's when you don't like something that's hard to focus, shifting states is hard.

2:06:18.760 --> 2:06:22.640
 I'm sure you've experienced this, if you've ever been in deep research or podcasting podcasting

2:06:22.640 --> 2:06:26.040
 and then all of a sudden you go for a run, you probably spend the first third of that

2:06:26.040 --> 2:06:27.400
 run thinking.

2:06:27.400 --> 2:06:31.040
 And then in the middle third, you're kind of, that thinking is fractured a bit.

2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:34.520
 And then in the final third is where you finally get to relax.

2:06:34.520 --> 2:06:37.160
 Because the brain doesn't shift states very quickly.

2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:39.160
 We can go from sleep to wakefulness quickly.

2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:43.720
 We can go from wakefulness to sleep quickly, but we don't shift between different states

2:06:43.720 --> 2:06:49.640
 of consciousness like a step function, except in rare cases, right?

2:06:49.640 --> 2:06:50.640
 Fear is one.

2:06:50.640 --> 2:06:52.040
 All of a sudden we hear an explosion right now.

2:06:52.040 --> 2:06:53.040
 It's a step function.

2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:58.120
 We're in fear or we're in alertness, right, a heightened state of alertness.

2:06:58.120 --> 2:07:03.240
 But NSDR is terrific at allowing people to learn to shift their state.

2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:09.800
 And I actually would venture to argue that part of the value of meditation and exercise

2:07:09.800 --> 2:07:13.480
 is the actual state that you get into in deep meditation or exercise.

2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:18.080
 But just as valuable is the transition that you have to take yourself through from one

2:07:18.080 --> 2:07:21.080
 state of mind to the other and then back again.

2:07:21.080 --> 2:07:24.800
 When I look, you know, David Goggins, he always seems to come up because he represents so

2:07:24.800 --> 2:07:30.200
 many important things, drive, determination, override of emotional state, going from being

2:07:30.200 --> 2:07:32.920
 a 300 pound plus person to a fit person through.

2:07:32.920 --> 2:07:36.840
 He's never revealed anything substantial about what he ate or what he didn't eat.

2:07:36.840 --> 2:07:41.200
 He's basically says like, listen, run a lot, eat less, right?

2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:46.840
 But what's remarkable is so much of what he says is about those transitions, about taking

2:07:46.840 --> 2:07:51.280
 oneself from a state of, I don't want to, to scruffing oneself and like you're going

2:07:51.280 --> 2:07:56.600
 to do it anyway, and then being able to carry that into regular life, so to speak.

2:07:56.600 --> 2:08:00.320
 So I think that NSDR is immensely powerful.

2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:01.600
 It's zero cost.

2:08:01.600 --> 2:08:06.240
 And one of the reasons I'm such a fan of people doing it is that most people don't stick

2:08:06.240 --> 2:08:08.360
 to a meditation practice.

2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:10.440
 There also been a few cases you might find this interesting.

2:08:10.440 --> 2:08:11.960
 There's a book by Scott Carney.

2:08:11.960 --> 2:08:12.960
 I forget what it's called.

2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:15.200
 I think it's called the transcendence trap or something.

2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:20.040
 I'm going to have that title wrong, but there have been a fair number of cases of people

2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:25.440
 that go and do very extensive meditation, silent meditation retreats, who then return

2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:28.200
 to normal life and end up killing themselves.

2:08:28.200 --> 2:08:32.440
 There are states of mind inside of extended meditations or silent meditations that are

2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:34.160
 very beneficial.

2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:38.520
 And I'm certainly not suggesting people don't meditate, but I know at least one person who

2:08:38.520 --> 2:08:42.800
 came back from one of these long extended meditation retreats and wasn't able to shift

2:08:42.800 --> 2:08:45.880
 their state back into one that was functional in regular life.

2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:47.600
 And that book includes a very dramatic story.

2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:51.920
 I don't want to give it away in case people check out the book, but Scott told the story

2:08:51.920 --> 2:09:00.640
 to me directly once where someone feels they've reached enlightenment and then commit suicide.

2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:07.360
 So these very unusual brain states are potentially hazardous if people can't return from them.

2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:12.800
 So it's nice to focus not on those brain states, but instead on the shifting.

2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:13.800
 Right.

2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:16.000
 This morning I woke up a little bit earlier than I would have liked.

2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:20.800
 I use this Reverie app that's research backed, REVRI.com.

2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:23.440
 There's a free version of it, or you can try it for free.

2:09:23.440 --> 2:09:24.440
 So I feel comfortable.

2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:25.440
 That's for hypnosis.

2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:26.440
 For hypnosis.

2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:29.200
 And I do a self hypnosis to put me back into sleep.

2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:31.440
 And if I can't sleep, just put me into a state of deep relaxation.

2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:37.320
 I would put hypnosis under the category of NSDR, yoga, nidra under the category of NSDR.

2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:41.320
 There are now some NSDR scripts online if you just go to YouTube that you can just listen

2:09:41.320 --> 2:09:42.320
 to.

2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:43.320
 Do you like those?

2:09:43.320 --> 2:09:44.320
 I do.

2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:45.320
 Yeah.

2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:46.320
 I think the one from Maid 4 is quite good.

2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:47.320
 I have an affiliation with them, but it's free.

2:09:47.320 --> 2:09:48.480
 So I feel comfortable mentioning it.

2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:49.480
 I do.

2:09:49.480 --> 2:09:51.880
 I really like the Reverie app.

2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:52.880
 I can vary.

2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:55.680
 And the more you do them, the more quickly you can shift your brain into a state of deep

2:09:55.680 --> 2:09:56.680
 relaxation.

2:09:56.680 --> 2:10:00.880
 I will sometimes stop mid podcast.

2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:04.000
 Sometimes our recordings go seven, eight hours and I'll stop and I'll do a one minute

2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:05.000
 hypnosis.

2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:06.680
 They have one minute hypnosis inside Reverie.

2:10:06.680 --> 2:10:12.720
 You're only going to find that one minute hypnosis is effective if you are routinely

2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:18.640
 doing 10 and 15 minute hypnosis in addition to that, meaning I do it every other day or

2:10:18.640 --> 2:10:19.640
 so, 10 or 15 minutes.

2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:23.520
 So is there a YouTube one minute hypnosis or is this for the other?

2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:24.520
 There are.

2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:26.480
 But inside of Reverie as well, you can find them online.

2:10:26.480 --> 2:10:27.480
 A really good...

2:10:27.480 --> 2:10:28.480
 Pull it up.

2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:29.480
 Sorry, please.

2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:30.480
 Yeah.

2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:31.480
 So Reverie is good.

2:10:31.480 --> 2:10:34.600
 And then Michael Seely, S E A L E Y, he has some long hypnosis scripts.

2:10:34.600 --> 2:10:40.360
 But again, these are all free and there's a lot of good research now on the neural networks

2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:44.640
 and shifts your so called default network, the default mode network is shifts how much

2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:47.000
 of your forebrain you're using.

2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:49.400
 And it also is very, very good.

2:10:49.400 --> 2:10:53.040
 I get so many questions about, hey, I'm really upset.

2:10:53.040 --> 2:10:57.080
 I found out about my girlfriend's sexual past or, hey, I'm so upset.

2:10:57.080 --> 2:11:00.040
 I found out that my boyfriend was cheating or, oh, so and so died.

2:11:00.040 --> 2:11:01.320
 How do I get over these emotions?

2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:02.600
 How do I deal with them?

2:11:02.600 --> 2:11:06.840
 And hypnosis has shown to be very useful for people to learn to bring themselves into

2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:13.480
 a state of deep relaxation, to literally project in their mind's eye, these very intense things

2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:15.600
 that they don't like.

2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:21.320
 And then for people to associate with other emotions in their body to learn to be calm

2:11:21.320 --> 2:11:27.040
 while feeling your feelings, to dissociate the mind body communication to some extent.

2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:28.880
 Just observe the feelings.

2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:32.040
 Observe them and start to associate them with positive experiences.

2:11:32.040 --> 2:11:36.200
 You're an Android guy, so soon it should be available on Android and then it doesn't exist

2:11:36.200 --> 2:11:37.200
 for me.

2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:38.200
 Yeah, I know.

2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:39.320
 It's only, you know, I don't get it.

2:11:39.320 --> 2:11:42.920
 Android is the device of the people, all you elitist people with your iPhones.

2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:47.200
 Okay, but tell me this about Android now, now you want to, this is the one thing that

2:11:47.200 --> 2:11:48.200
 gets me.

2:11:48.200 --> 2:11:49.200
 Yeah.

2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:50.720
 Because I'm very close to someone who uses an Android phone.

2:11:50.720 --> 2:11:51.880
 I feel like that.

2:11:51.880 --> 2:11:54.080
 So you, you have great people in your life.

2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:55.080
 That's good to know.

2:11:55.080 --> 2:12:00.320
 No, their messages always look green to me, but I answer yours, not despite that.

2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:03.640
 But they, I feel like the Android phones are very trigger happy.

2:12:03.640 --> 2:12:07.640
 Like anything I touch does something, whereas the Apple phone is kind of built for like

2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:12.160
 a macaque monkey to be able to operate, which is great for me because I'm more of a macaque

2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:14.200
 monkey and you're a more sophisticated ape.

2:12:14.200 --> 2:12:15.840
 Oh, I see, I see.

2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:17.720
 I think like you have to be more sensitive.

2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:18.720
 You have to be.

2:12:18.720 --> 2:12:20.840
 Yeah, you have to have, you know, I mean, I've got fat fingers, you know, I've got clumsy

2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:21.840
 fingers.

2:12:21.840 --> 2:12:26.600
 And the Android is too, well, maybe you need to soften your touch.

2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:31.360
 What I would do is go into the most sort by most popular because there's some older ones

2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:33.480
 that I really like and it genuinely scales with that.

2:12:33.480 --> 2:12:39.040
 So I'll do the, this one, the hypnosis for clearing subconscious negativity.

2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:43.200
 That's an hour long one, the sleep and anxiety one, 40 minutes, but those you listen to as

2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:44.200
 you fall asleep.

2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:45.200
 As you fall asleep.

2:12:45.200 --> 2:12:46.200
 We're going to do this now.

2:12:46.200 --> 2:12:47.200
 Yeah.

2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:48.200
 Let's listen to it.

2:12:48.200 --> 2:12:54.080
 And I have created this hypnosis recording for you to help you and this is the voice.

2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:56.000
 How often does the voice pop up?

2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:03.000
 At the same time, you don't watch it, you just listen to it.

2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:12.680
 Now, one of the most important things of any self hypnosis experience is to know and understand

2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:19.040
 so people really should know that stage hypnosis is about the hypnotist getting you to do things

2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:21.560
 you wouldn't normally do.

2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:26.000
 Self hypnosis, which is what we're talking about here, reverie in this is about you getting

2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.920
 your brain into the state that you want.

2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:34.560
 And again, I mean, there's a ton of neuroimaging data and work on trauma and pain relief and

2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:36.960
 our labs are working on this with David Spiegel's lab.

2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:40.800
 I really encourage people to explore NSDR and if this feels a little too wacky and

2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:46.200
 out there, then I would just put in NSDR into YouTube and there's some good NSDR scripts.

2:13:46.200 --> 2:13:47.200
 Yes.

2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:49.600
 That's by the way, Sandra is a fan of your podcast.

2:13:49.600 --> 2:13:50.600
 No, it's okay.

2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:51.600
 I like to play.

2:13:51.600 --> 2:13:52.600
 Yeah.

2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:58.960
 So, I don't know him, but I get a lot of media outlets picked up on his love of NSDR.

2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:02.920
 And I have to imagine running Google involves a lot of juggling a lot of...

2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:05.800
 He's one of the great CEOs because everybody loves him.

2:14:05.800 --> 2:14:06.800
 Everybody loves him.

2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:07.800
 Have you interviewed him?

2:14:07.800 --> 2:14:10.400
 No, but we'll do the interview eventually.

2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:15.800
 So, is this annoying thing about me being a stickler for three hours?

2:14:15.800 --> 2:14:20.440
 CEOs don't seem to understand, like not understand, but it's scheduling.

2:14:20.440 --> 2:14:23.600
 So what happens is, Sandra said, yes, definitely, let's do it.

2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:27.200
 I'm a fan of podcasts as a fan of yours.

2:14:27.200 --> 2:14:32.200
 And then it goes to his executive assistant, like, oh, let's find a slot.

2:14:32.200 --> 2:14:35.600
 And then they immediately think, all right, well, one hour is good.

2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:36.600
 45 minutes.

2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:37.600
 90 minutes.

2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:38.600
 By Zoom.

2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:39.600
 90 minutes.

2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:40.600
 Yeah, right.

2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:42.280
 Well, no, they know in person though that I'm a stickler on that.

2:14:42.280 --> 2:14:45.240
 But like, it's like, no, we need more.

2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:46.680
 And it's so hard to...

2:14:46.680 --> 2:14:49.560
 Do you still travel to do your podcast or generally?

2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:51.040
 No, most people come down here.

2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:52.540
 Most people.

2:14:52.540 --> 2:15:00.560
 But for certain situations, obviously, like if you're in prison or you're ahead of something.

2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:03.320
 Imagine if you get out on work for a lot of the people who have anklets so that they

2:15:03.320 --> 2:15:04.880
 can go to an Alex Friedman podcast.

2:15:04.880 --> 2:15:05.880
 It'll probably happen.

2:15:05.880 --> 2:15:07.840
 Have you ever been in a prison?

2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:08.840
 No.

2:15:08.840 --> 2:15:13.400
 Either a visitation or on the inside.

2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:15.480
 From my hike, I can see San Quentin.

2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:18.760
 It's really weird that San Quentin and Alcatraz, Bay Area, beautiful, everyone, things like,

2:15:18.760 --> 2:15:22.680
 you know, like there's the bay and there's Alcatraz and San Quentin sitting right there.

2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:25.040
 Does that make you feel...

2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:28.200
 You know, it's amazing how easy it is to overlook that they're there and forget that

2:15:28.200 --> 2:15:29.200
 they're there.

2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:31.720
 But when I drive by San Quentin, I think about it.

2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:34.720
 I also think about the people who are in there who might be innocent.

2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:39.400
 I've seen some of those episodes on Rogan and elsewhere, and Amanda Knox talks a lot

2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:40.400
 about this, right?

2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:44.960
 Whether or not you believe her story or not, I happen to believe her story personally based

2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:48.800
 on what I know, but, you know, I'm sure there are people disagree with me.

2:15:48.800 --> 2:15:54.240
 I think to myself, what it must be like to be in a cell and know in your heart's heart

2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:56.640
 you didn't do it.

2:15:56.640 --> 2:16:01.080
 You know, I mean, I can't think of many things worse.

2:16:01.080 --> 2:16:02.920
 I can't think of many things worse.

2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:09.800
 That's so clearly unjust, but life is full of unjust things like this.

2:16:09.800 --> 2:16:16.640
 Cruel things happen all the time, you lose a loved one for no good reason.

2:16:16.640 --> 2:16:20.480
 You lose your job.

2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:21.480
 You lose your home.

2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:26.400
 Yeah, I've been talking to a lot of refugees now, and the war in Ukraine has really focused

2:16:26.400 --> 2:16:29.440
 my mind to how much suffering there is in the world.

2:16:29.440 --> 2:16:35.440
 And so just cruel things happen all the time, and people kind of...

2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:38.760
 There's this suffering, and you kind of go on.

2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:44.840
 You stick to the people really close to you, they still love all around you.

2:16:44.840 --> 2:16:50.960
 Traumatic events kind of focus your mind on the like very practical like, okay, how do

2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:51.960
 we solve the problem?

2:16:51.960 --> 2:16:52.960
 How do we escape?

2:16:52.960 --> 2:16:57.040
 Let's solve like survival, food, shelter, focus.

2:16:57.040 --> 2:17:01.120
 Remember that book, Also Quiet on the Western Front by World War I?

2:17:01.120 --> 2:17:02.120
 There's this line in there.

2:17:02.120 --> 2:17:06.240
 I forget what it is about how war is like the smell of a skunk.

2:17:06.240 --> 2:17:12.960
 Like a little bit is actually slightly, there's something slightly delicious of it is what

2:17:12.960 --> 2:17:14.920
 it says in the book.

2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:17.680
 I happen to like the smell of like ferrets and skunks and things.

2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:21.840
 I had a pet ferret when I was a kid, and I like that musky scent.

2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:23.560
 Most people just it's repulsive to them.

2:17:23.560 --> 2:17:25.720
 It's actually a gene, believe it or not.

2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:29.480
 Some people have the gene that makes the musky scent repulsive.

2:17:29.480 --> 2:17:32.160
 Some people love it.

2:17:32.160 --> 2:17:33.160
 Let me ask you this.

2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:34.160
 There's another gene.

2:17:34.160 --> 2:17:35.160
 This is a fun one.

2:17:35.160 --> 2:17:38.600
 Microwave popcorn smells good and neutral or disgusting to you.

2:17:38.600 --> 2:17:39.600
 Good.

2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:40.600
 Very good.

2:17:40.600 --> 2:17:44.320
 There are people who have a gene that leads them to the perception that the smell of microwave

2:17:44.320 --> 2:17:46.200
 popcorn that you find is good.

2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:48.440
 It smells like putrid vomit to them.

2:17:48.440 --> 2:17:53.760
 It's a particular gene variant and they can smell certain elements within the microwave

2:17:53.760 --> 2:17:56.520
 popcorn.

2:17:56.520 --> 2:18:00.760
 It's prominent in France, this gene.

2:18:00.760 --> 2:18:05.240
 So in laboratories where you have a lot of French people, it's often said like you're

2:18:05.240 --> 2:18:06.640
 not allowed to make microwave popcorn.

2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:09.520
 It smells putrid, disgusting.

2:18:09.520 --> 2:18:14.760
 So a lot of it's in the perception of the beholder.

2:18:14.760 --> 2:18:23.680
 But before I leave the NSDR, focus in general, as you said, it's for shifting mind states.

2:18:23.680 --> 2:18:30.000
 Is there advice you have for how to achieve focus on a task?

2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:34.840
 First of all, we have to distinguish between modulators and mediators.

2:18:34.840 --> 2:18:36.840
 And I'll do this very briefly.

2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:40.520
 There are a lot of things that will modulate your state of focus, but they don't directly

2:18:40.520 --> 2:18:42.280
 mediate your sense of focus.

2:18:42.280 --> 2:18:46.880
 So for instance, if right now a fire alarm went off in this building, it would modulate

2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:48.160
 our attention.

2:18:48.160 --> 2:18:49.160
 We would get up and leave.

2:18:49.160 --> 2:18:52.440
 It would be very hard to do what we're doing with that banging in the background, at least

2:18:52.440 --> 2:18:54.440
 at first.

2:18:54.440 --> 2:19:01.100
 So it's modulating focus, but it's not really involved in the mechanisms of focus.

2:19:01.100 --> 2:19:05.720
 In the same way, being well rested when you sleep, your autonomic nervous system that

2:19:05.720 --> 2:19:10.680
 adjusts states of alertness and focus and calm works better than when you're sleep deprived.

2:19:10.680 --> 2:19:12.600
 So if you're sleeping better, you're going to focus better.

2:19:12.600 --> 2:19:17.960
 So I always answer this way to a question like this because the best thing that anyone

2:19:17.960 --> 2:19:22.480
 can do for their mental health, physical health and performance in athletic or cognitive endeavors

2:19:22.480 --> 2:19:27.120
 or creative endeavors is to make sure that you're getting enough quality sleep, enough

2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:28.440
 of the time for you.

2:19:28.440 --> 2:19:29.440
 And that's going to differ.

2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:30.440
 We could talk about what that means.

2:19:30.440 --> 2:19:35.040
 Now, in terms of things that mediate focus without getting into the description of mechanisms

2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:41.360
 because we have podcasts about that, it's very clear that mental focus follows visual

2:19:41.360 --> 2:19:45.440
 focus provided that you're a sighted person.

2:19:45.440 --> 2:19:50.000
 Much of the training that's being done now in China to teach kids to focus better literally

2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:55.640
 has them stare at a target, blinking every so often, but really training themselves

2:19:55.640 --> 2:20:00.600
 to breathe calmly and maintain a tight visual aperture.

2:20:00.600 --> 2:20:03.320
 When you read, you have to maintain a tight visual aperture.

2:20:03.320 --> 2:20:06.640
 You're literally scrolling like a highlighter in your mind's eye.

2:20:06.640 --> 2:20:08.260
 It's kind of obvious once you hear it.

2:20:08.260 --> 2:20:14.940
 So for people that have problems focusing sleep well, learn to dilate and contract your

2:20:14.940 --> 2:20:17.120
 visual field consciously.

2:20:17.120 --> 2:20:19.920
 This can be done if you practice it a little bit.

2:20:19.920 --> 2:20:24.100
 And then, as I said before, it is very hard to get into a state of focus like a step function

2:20:24.100 --> 2:20:26.120
 immediately like snapping your fingers.

2:20:26.120 --> 2:20:31.720
 What you can do is you can pick any object, but ideally an object at roughly the same distance,

2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:35.920
 placed at roughly the same distance to which you're going to do that work and stare at it.

2:20:35.920 --> 2:20:37.200
 You're allowed to blink.

2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:41.040
 And as your mind starts to drift every once in a while to understand that's normal, but

2:20:41.040 --> 2:20:46.600
 try and narrow your visual aperture and bring that into your visual field so that that's

2:20:46.600 --> 2:20:49.000
 the most prominent thing, kind of like portrait mode in your phone.

2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:52.840
 And this would look very different in portrait mode than it would in just a standard photograph

2:20:52.840 --> 2:20:53.840
 mode.

2:20:53.840 --> 2:20:58.560
 And then after doing that for 30 to 60 seconds, moving into the work that you're about to

2:20:58.560 --> 2:21:01.400
 do and really encourage yourself to do that.

2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:04.760
 If you're somebody who's low vision or no vision, you're going to use your ears to do

2:21:04.760 --> 2:21:05.760
 this.

2:21:05.760 --> 2:21:10.520
 Braille readers have trouble focusing sometimes because they feel other stuff and they hear

2:21:10.520 --> 2:21:11.840
 other stuff.

2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:15.280
 So you learn to adjust that aperture consciously.

2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:17.720
 And then of course, the pharmacologic tools.

2:21:17.720 --> 2:21:20.880
 Just enough caffeine, but not too much, right?

2:21:20.880 --> 2:21:24.960
 We talked about white noise, brown noise, music or no music really varies, but it's

2:21:24.960 --> 2:21:31.240
 very clear that binaural beats of 40 hertz can shift the brain into a heightened state

2:21:31.240 --> 2:21:32.680
 of focus and cognition.

2:21:32.680 --> 2:21:37.040
 So if you're going to use binaural beats, which should definitely be used with headphones

2:21:37.040 --> 2:21:43.080
 and their number of free apps out there and sources, 40 hertz seems to be the frequency

2:21:43.080 --> 2:21:46.960
 that best supports the brain shifting into a particular moment.

2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:49.560
 Can you give us some binaural beats?

2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:50.560
 Yeah.

2:21:50.560 --> 2:21:51.560
 So you're going to look for it.

2:21:51.560 --> 2:21:54.920
 You'd want to find an app that offers 40 hertz.

2:21:54.920 --> 2:22:02.640
 I think Brainwave allows you to slide bar up to the particular frequency that you want.

2:22:02.640 --> 2:22:07.720
 And I should say that there are other frequencies that are interesting, but 40 hertz binaural

2:22:07.720 --> 2:22:11.560
 beats seems to be the one that there's the most quality research on.

2:22:11.560 --> 2:22:14.040
 It's like a beat.

2:22:14.040 --> 2:22:19.360
 You're saying there's a lot of mixed science on the white noise and brown noise.

2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:20.360
 Yeah.

2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:23.040
 You really should be doing this with headphones because binaural beats are best accomplished

2:22:23.040 --> 2:22:26.280
 by feeding two different frequencies to the two ears.

2:22:26.280 --> 2:22:29.360
 And then you have what's called this brainstem area that reads out what are called interaural

2:22:29.360 --> 2:22:30.360
 time differences.

2:22:30.360 --> 2:22:33.280
 And then it extracts the delta, essentially.

2:22:33.280 --> 2:22:39.480
 Turn it up.

2:22:39.480 --> 2:22:41.280
 And then in other things that can enhance focus.

2:22:41.280 --> 2:22:44.280
 So the pharmacology around this is pretty interesting.

2:22:44.280 --> 2:22:48.840
 Things that tickle the dopamine pathway and the acetylcholine pathway, they work.

2:22:48.840 --> 2:22:51.960
 There's your riddolin, your adderols, your modafinils, which are prescription.

2:22:51.960 --> 2:22:55.860
 And there's a lot of nonprescription use of those prescription drugs.

2:22:55.860 --> 2:23:00.560
 Not so much in my generation, but in people 35 and younger.

2:23:00.560 --> 2:23:04.560
 I hear all the time from day traders and programmers and stuff and kids that play video

2:23:04.560 --> 2:23:06.920
 games, a lot of riddolin, adderol use.

2:23:06.920 --> 2:23:11.040
 I think that unless it's prescribed by a doctor for its specific purpose of ADHD, I don't

2:23:11.040 --> 2:23:15.280
 think people should go that route, frankly, hits the dopamine system way too hard.

2:23:15.280 --> 2:23:20.320
 Also has a number of negative effects on sexual side effects, all sorts of things that you

2:23:20.320 --> 2:23:21.680
 just wouldn't want.

2:23:21.680 --> 2:23:27.920
 There are a few compounds like alpha GPC, 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC

2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:29.000
 with a cup of espresso.

2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:33.760
 If you're well rested, you're like a laser for 90 minutes, maybe two hours.

2:23:33.760 --> 2:23:37.480
 But then it's going to taper off and you have to just recognize that.

2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:42.360
 And then there's this whole world of new tropics now and people trying to figure out the racitams,

2:23:42.360 --> 2:23:45.640
 paracitams and phenylethylamine combined with this.

2:23:45.640 --> 2:23:48.480
 And it's not quite in the place where you'd like it to be.

2:23:48.480 --> 2:23:50.520
 There are a few companies that are doing this better than others.

2:23:50.520 --> 2:23:55.200
 We talk about some of these on the podcast, but I would always start with behavioral tools

2:23:55.200 --> 2:23:58.200
 and then consider pharmacology.

2:23:58.200 --> 2:24:03.800
 And then I suppose the other thing for focus is this is a little more esoteric, but we

2:24:03.800 --> 2:24:07.320
 cover this in an episode on workplace optimization.

2:24:07.320 --> 2:24:10.360
 Where you place your screen is important.

2:24:10.360 --> 2:24:14.040
 Staring down at a screen is not going to be as effective as placing it at eye level or

2:24:14.040 --> 2:24:15.200
 above you.

2:24:15.200 --> 2:24:19.200
 When the eyes are up, literally when your eyes are directed forward or up, the brainstem

2:24:19.200 --> 2:24:21.080
 centers for alertness are activated.

2:24:21.080 --> 2:24:25.200
 When your eyes are down, it's actually your sort of, it's like being pulled underwater

2:24:25.200 --> 2:24:28.160
 a little bit in the autonomic arousal sense.

2:24:28.160 --> 2:24:32.560
 You're closing your eyes.

2:24:32.560 --> 2:24:38.480
 It reflects the brainstem centers that are active for alertness, excuse me, becoming

2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:39.920
 less active.

2:24:39.920 --> 2:24:43.440
 But there's a really cool effect that's active in this room right now, which is that there

2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:48.080
 have been some really interesting studies that when people work in small compact spaces

2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:53.660
 or wear a hoodie or a hat, that can also improve focus like blinders on a horse for obvious

2:24:53.660 --> 2:24:55.720
 reasons now based on what I said before.

2:24:55.720 --> 2:25:01.120
 But also analytic work or the kind of work where there's a correct answer that you're

2:25:01.120 --> 2:25:06.000
 seeking is best supported by these kind of low ceiling environments, whereas there's

2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:09.760
 something called the cathedral effect, which is when you work in an outdoor environment

2:25:09.760 --> 2:25:16.280
 or a high ceiling environment, it lends itself to kind of pun intended, kind of loftier ideas

2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:17.840
 and more creativity.

2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:21.200
 And that probably has to do with the fact that there's a natural tendency, a reflex

2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:26.840
 to expand your visual field in these high ceiling environments.

2:25:26.840 --> 2:25:31.920
 Kind of the visual field changes the way the brain works in the time domain.

2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:37.840
 Your engineering and biology oriented listeners will understand this and music.

2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:41.860
 For those that don't, the best way to think about is when you have a narrow focus, portrait

2:25:41.860 --> 2:25:47.760
 mode on your phone or you're very alert, you are fine slicing life in time.

2:25:47.760 --> 2:25:52.960
 It's like a, think of it as a high frame rate, like you're shooting in slow motion.

2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:58.240
 When you have a, when you dilate your view, you're taking bigger time bins.

2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:02.960
 And that one way to just let this hopefully land home is that if you've ever had a really

2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:10.360
 exciting day or podcast interview or experience of any kind, your system is flooded with dopamine

2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:13.880
 and norepinephrine alertness and motivation and all this excitement.

2:26:13.880 --> 2:26:16.120
 It seems like it goes by very, very fast.

2:26:16.120 --> 2:26:19.960
 And yet when you think back to that, it seems like a lot happened.

2:26:19.960 --> 2:26:20.960
 This happened and that happened.

2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:25.360
 Now think about waiting in the doctor's office in a blank waiting room with no interesting

2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:26.880
 art on the walls.

2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:31.960
 It feels like it goes by very, very slow, dopamine and norepinephrine are all time low.

2:26:31.960 --> 2:26:37.080
 And yet when you think back on that experience, it's as if nothing happened because you were

2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:39.400
 parsing time differently.

2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:45.040
 So those are roughly the tools and the neurochemicals around time perception and the time domain.

2:26:45.040 --> 2:26:46.880
 There's a wonderful book, I'm forgetting the title.

2:26:46.880 --> 2:26:51.160
 So wonderful, I forget the title, by Dean Buodomano from UCLA.

2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:55.240
 But I think it's called The Brain is a Time Machine that talks about this expansion and

2:26:55.240 --> 2:27:00.040
 contraction of the time domain and what you can do to leverage it for work and creativity

2:27:00.040 --> 2:27:01.040
 focus and so on.

2:27:01.040 --> 2:27:02.040
 Yeah.

2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:08.280
 It's fascinating that I think one way to define focus for me is the experience, the feeling

2:27:08.280 --> 2:27:16.440
 of focus is losing track of time is getting to a place where you're no longer operating

2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:17.440
 in time.

2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:23.000
 Well, and you mentioned being kind of cramming for something, well, you'll release a lot

2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:28.480
 of adrenaline and it is true you can get a lot done under pressure because of the way

2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:30.160
 that you're slicing time.

2:27:30.160 --> 2:27:32.200
 You don't actually have more time.

2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:36.800
 It's that you're finally in a brain state that lends itself well to parsing information

2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:37.800
 really quickly.

2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:44.480
 Now, if we ramp up your level of stress enough, it's definitely a more or less normal distribution.

2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:47.320
 If you get you stressed enough, it's hard to remember anything, you're not parsing time

2:27:47.320 --> 2:27:48.320
 well.

2:27:48.320 --> 2:27:51.400
 But in that middle range, almost every study shows that the higher levels of autonomic

2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:56.600
 arousal, meaning we're up an effort in adrenaline in your system, the more effective you are

2:27:56.600 --> 2:27:57.760
 at things.

2:27:57.760 --> 2:28:00.840
 And we always hear stress and adrenaline is just bad, bad, bad.

2:28:00.840 --> 2:28:04.520
 But my colleague, Ali Cromit, Stanford has done these beautiful studies where if you

2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:11.160
 just educate people on how adrenaline makes them sharper thinkers, they become sharper

2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:12.160
 thinkers.

2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:15.560
 And if you educate them on the fact that stress makes your cognition worse, their cognition

2:28:15.560 --> 2:28:16.560
 gets worse.

2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:18.080
 This is why I don't wear a sleep tracker.

2:28:18.080 --> 2:28:22.720
 If you tell people they slept poorly, your recovery score sucks, they naturally perform

2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:26.960
 less well the next day than if you tell them your recovery score is high.

2:28:26.960 --> 2:28:30.880
 And so I don't have anything against those companies, but in fact, we use some of their

2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:37.160
 technology can be very useful in certain contexts, but you want to determine your mindset around

2:28:37.160 --> 2:28:38.160
 these things.

2:28:38.160 --> 2:28:42.040
 And if you tell yourself, hey, deadlines make me sharp, pressure makes me sharp.

2:28:42.040 --> 2:28:43.400
 You will perform better.

2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:47.760
 So stress and anxiety.

2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:48.760
 What is that?

2:28:48.760 --> 2:28:51.200
 And can it be leveraged for good?

2:28:51.200 --> 2:28:52.200
 Absolutely.

2:28:52.200 --> 2:28:53.200
 Stress and anxiety.

2:28:53.200 --> 2:28:57.280
 Look, whether or not you get into a cold ice bath or a hot sauna so hot you want to get

2:28:57.280 --> 2:29:03.520
 out or you get hit square in the face with something over text that you really didn't

2:29:03.520 --> 2:29:06.800
 want to hear or see, it's adrenaline.

2:29:06.800 --> 2:29:07.920
 It's just adrenaline.

2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:11.400
 And so your subjective readout of that and what it means is really important.

2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:13.160
 And you can just channel that.

2:29:13.160 --> 2:29:14.680
 Well, you can.

2:29:14.680 --> 2:29:19.000
 If you agree with the following statement, which I do and many people do because the

2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:23.880
 data support it, which is Ali Krumm's statement, not mine, which is she directs the MindBody

2:29:23.880 --> 2:29:24.880
 Lab at Stanford.

2:29:24.880 --> 2:29:26.680
 She's brilliant, by the way.

2:29:26.680 --> 2:29:31.640
 Brilliant Harvard trained Yale trained licensed clinical psychologist, also tenure professor.

2:29:31.640 --> 2:29:41.320
 She's a division one athlete in gymnastics and martial arts and her dad is a longtime

2:29:41.320 --> 2:29:45.040
 martial arts trainer who's done work with special forces and amazing human being and

2:29:45.040 --> 2:29:50.520
 very humble, very kind, lovely woman and professor, scientist.

2:29:50.520 --> 2:29:57.400
 She says anything that you do and experience, but especially stress is the consequence of

2:29:57.400 --> 2:30:01.200
 that thing and what you believe about that thing.

2:30:01.200 --> 2:30:06.840
 And so if you consume a lot of information about the powers of stressful states to bring

2:30:06.840 --> 2:30:09.280
 out your best, you will perform better.

2:30:09.280 --> 2:30:13.520
 If you consume a lot of information about the power of stress to cripple you, you will

2:30:13.520 --> 2:30:15.400
 perform worse.

2:30:15.400 --> 2:30:16.720
 There's absolutely no question.

2:30:16.720 --> 2:30:20.680
 The data are striking and this is not growth mindset.

2:30:20.680 --> 2:30:27.880
 This is just simply what do you believe about stress based on the dominant knowledge that

2:30:27.880 --> 2:30:29.000
 you're consuming about it?

2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:31.720
 So that's why it's fun to watch David Goggins.

2:30:31.720 --> 2:30:37.600
 Here we go again, David or Jocko or Joe or Cam Haynes put out this information about

2:30:37.600 --> 2:30:43.400
 or Ryan Hall who ran for Stanford and then now is into the powerlifting thing and running.

2:30:43.400 --> 2:30:45.240
 And there are others too, of course.

2:30:45.240 --> 2:30:50.600
 When you start to consume a lot of that information, it's not just inspiring, it actually changes

2:30:50.600 --> 2:30:55.120
 your perception of what your own stressful states mean.

2:30:55.120 --> 2:30:59.960
 You can actually get better from stress if you're in the ocean of knowledge that stress

2:30:59.960 --> 2:31:01.120
 grows you.

2:31:01.120 --> 2:31:04.840
 If you're in the ocean of living in the ocean of knowledge, I was seeing like a pool in

2:31:04.840 --> 2:31:05.840
 the summer.

2:31:05.840 --> 2:31:08.200
 You've got the kiddie pool, the kids all peeing in it, presumably.

2:31:08.200 --> 2:31:10.720
 You've got the diving thing, you've got the high dive and all that.

2:31:10.720 --> 2:31:15.160
 If you believe that the experience of belly flopping off the high dive is going to make

2:31:15.160 --> 2:31:21.320
 you a better diver, in some sense, at least in this analogy, it will, whereas if you feel

2:31:21.320 --> 2:31:25.360
 that it's just the most embarrassing thing ever and it's going to cripple your ability

2:31:25.360 --> 2:31:30.240
 to get out on the dive in front of anybody ever again, well, you're right about that

2:31:30.240 --> 2:31:31.240
 too.

2:31:31.240 --> 2:31:36.280
 Yeah, we actually talked with Carl about depression, all those kinds of things that there could

2:31:36.280 --> 2:31:44.960
 be these, what are commonly seen as negative journeys that could be, when reframed, can

2:31:44.960 --> 2:31:45.960
 be used.

2:31:45.960 --> 2:31:50.240
 You know, one of the reasons I enjoy our friendship so much is that you bring this Russian thing,

2:31:50.240 --> 2:31:52.880
 you know, which I don't really understand it at a deep level.

2:31:52.880 --> 2:31:53.880
 How could I?

2:31:53.880 --> 2:31:58.800
 I'm not Russian, but this mindset like that there's pain in life.

2:31:58.800 --> 2:32:05.200
 When I watched that Hedgehog in the Fog cartoon, I thought, no wonder Russians do.

2:32:05.200 --> 2:32:08.920
 This is the most, it's so sad, it's beautiful and sad, it's so sad.

2:32:08.920 --> 2:32:12.960
 Whereas out here, it's like Sesame Street and, you know, my mother would not let me

2:32:12.960 --> 2:32:15.080
 watch Sesame Street when I was a kid.

2:32:15.080 --> 2:32:17.200
 She thought it was too chaotic.

2:32:17.200 --> 2:32:18.200
 Too chaotic.

2:32:18.200 --> 2:32:19.200
 Too chaotic.

2:32:19.200 --> 2:32:20.200
 She was like, it's too chaotic.

2:32:20.200 --> 2:32:21.200
 Too many things going on.

2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:24.200
 Captain Kangaroo, we were allowed and then Mr. Rogers, we were allowed.

2:32:24.200 --> 2:32:28.960
 I never really liked shows, I like doing things outside in the yard.

2:32:28.960 --> 2:32:32.240
 I was trying to trap all the animals, I didn't want to watch stuff on TV.

2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:37.680
 But you know, Hedgehog in the Fog is enough to turn any kid into a thinker and a philosopher

2:32:37.680 --> 2:32:38.680
 and a poet.

2:32:38.680 --> 2:32:40.240
 Here we go.

2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:43.800
 I fell in love with this when you showed, look at even walks with its arms behind its

2:32:43.800 --> 2:32:44.800
 back.

2:32:44.800 --> 2:32:49.800
 So for people who don't know and we're watching little clips here to get into, and it's a

2:32:49.800 --> 2:32:59.440
 Hedgehog that is wandering about in this fog at night and can't even see a lamp.

2:32:59.440 --> 2:33:00.440
 The fog is so dense.

2:33:00.440 --> 2:33:03.680
 And there's a feeling of searching.

2:33:03.680 --> 2:33:08.440
 And then there's a, there's a horse that speaks from, from a distance.

2:33:08.440 --> 2:33:09.440
 Words of wisdom.

2:33:09.440 --> 2:33:15.000
 Some people actually told me that they believe that's God that's supposed to represent God.

2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:21.240
 I always thought it was a motherly voice or a voice, a voice of conformity that wants

2:33:21.240 --> 2:33:23.320
 you to return to safety.

2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:31.160
 And here's a, the Hedgehog is searching for something that's in him for the unknown, to

2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:32.960
 the explore the unknown.

2:33:32.960 --> 2:33:43.760
 And ultimately as it, as the cartoon on roles, it's, he discovers a friend in a bear.

2:33:43.760 --> 2:33:48.640
 And he also discovers a lifetime passion for looking up at the stars and the curiosity

2:33:48.640 --> 2:33:50.840
 of exploring what is up there.

2:33:50.840 --> 2:33:55.660
 And I see that as science is, is exploring the mystery.

2:33:55.660 --> 2:34:01.440
 And also I see that as brave to explore the mystery given all the uncertainty all around

2:34:01.440 --> 2:34:02.440
 you.

2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:06.400
 But there is a melancholy, the whole sound of it, the feel of it, the look of it.

2:34:06.400 --> 2:34:16.360
 There's, it just captures both the melancholy and the wander of childhood, which is like,

2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:22.400
 there's a loneliness to it, like nobody understands me.

2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:26.720
 That's there that, that children can, can, can feel because you're, you're trying to

2:34:26.720 --> 2:34:27.720
 figure out.

2:34:27.720 --> 2:34:28.720
 It's my favorite character right there.

2:34:28.720 --> 2:34:29.720
 I love the owl.

2:34:29.720 --> 2:34:30.720
 I love the owl.

2:34:30.720 --> 2:34:32.200
 The owl shows up every once in a while.

2:34:32.200 --> 2:34:33.200
 I love the owl.

2:34:33.200 --> 2:34:34.200
 Sorry.

2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:35.200
 I, I interrupt to you.

2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:36.200
 Again.

2:34:36.200 --> 2:34:37.200
 There's non sequitur.

2:34:37.200 --> 2:34:39.680
 It means you're interested 70% of the time.

2:34:39.680 --> 2:34:41.840
 The other 30% you're just an asshole.

2:34:41.840 --> 2:34:43.200
 So you have to figure out what you're doing.

2:34:43.200 --> 2:34:47.560
 So I'm told the, there's non sequitur parts in this cartoon.

2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:51.920
 It's voted as one of the greatest cartoons of all time, short, short little films, documentary

2:34:51.920 --> 2:34:52.920
 filmmakers.

2:34:52.920 --> 2:35:02.400
 So it is, you know, in the Soviet Union, in, in a lot of sort of authoritarian regimes,

2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:08.360
 there's channels to communicate difficult ideas to people and you figure out those channels

2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:12.920
 and in the Soviet Union, one of those channels was children's cartoons.

2:35:12.920 --> 2:35:16.040
 So you're actually there very much for adults.

2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:17.040
 Yeah.

2:35:17.040 --> 2:35:23.680
 I, I like that in some countries, not so much in the US, children are treated with more

2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:29.680
 respect for their intelligence, you know, the, and not constantly getting this drivel

2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:35.120
 of, of just kind of moronic explosions and whistles and bells and the, the voices that

2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:40.080
 just kind of, you know, children, obviously our children and need to be, their brains

2:35:40.080 --> 2:35:45.400
 are young and plastic and need to be treated and nurtured as such.

2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:48.760
 But they, but they have an intelligence.

2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:53.880
 And I think that you treat them like morons and, and they're going to behave like morons.

2:35:53.880 --> 2:35:59.680
 You treat them as, you know, people who can consume information and make sense of it in

2:35:59.680 --> 2:36:00.920
 their own way.

2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:02.640
 And that's what they're going to do.

2:36:02.640 --> 2:36:05.240
 They have a seriousness of looking at the world.

2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:11.400
 I love people that talk with children like they're adults with this, like here's if you're

2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:18.000
 talking to a mini Einstein, because you're like really, they're asking some big questions.

2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:24.920
 And I think, I mean, people sometimes speak of me in this way, like, how dumb is this

2:36:24.920 --> 2:36:26.400
 childlike person?

2:36:26.400 --> 2:36:31.680
 But like, no, there's intelligence in these dumb, simple questions in like that a child

2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:32.680
 asks.

2:36:32.680 --> 2:36:39.080
 And I always love those questions, the simplicity, but also the depth of the, those, those questions.

2:36:39.080 --> 2:36:45.840
 The reason I started watching your podcast was you did an episode early on with Ray Dalio.

2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:50.480
 And the first, maybe the first, but a question that you definitely asked him was you just

2:36:50.480 --> 2:36:53.440
 said, what is money?

2:36:53.440 --> 2:36:54.720
 And his answer was fantastic.

2:36:54.720 --> 2:36:56.880
 It's a, it's a superb question.

2:36:56.880 --> 2:36:59.240
 And he gave a superb answer.

2:36:59.240 --> 2:37:04.280
 And I never would have thought to ask that question, but it's, it's the question.

2:37:04.280 --> 2:37:07.760
 And it was the question to tee things off with.

2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:14.080
 So simple questions that get right to the heart of the matter, you know, and kids aren't

2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:21.000
 often putting the same cultural filters and, you know, they're not kids generally aren't

2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:23.760
 concerned about getting canceled either.

2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:26.440
 So they'll ask the question that no one else is willing to ask.

2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:30.560
 And they're not concerned about the, how dumb the question sounds.

2:37:30.560 --> 2:37:34.040
 I find the most fascinating questions are just really, really simple.

2:37:34.040 --> 2:37:40.560
 And it is a bit embarrassing to ask those simple questions of what, like, what is anything.

2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:41.760
 You're asking them for all of us.

2:37:41.760 --> 2:37:43.760
 So please ask them.

2:37:43.760 --> 2:37:47.120
 I think that question, what is money is crucial.

2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:51.080
 And I think the simple questions are the most, obviously the most interesting.

2:37:51.080 --> 2:37:55.240
 I can ask you about, you had awesome podcasts, I mean, I can ask you questions about basically

2:37:55.240 --> 2:37:56.240
 all your podcasts.

2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:00.960
 People should definitely listen to the Cuban women lab, but with any gap in the conversation.

2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:03.760
 You talked about strength and muscle building and all that kind of stuff.

2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:04.760
 He's an encyclopedia.

2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:05.760
 Yeah.

2:38:05.760 --> 2:38:10.760
 And he also works with a lot of UFC fighters and he works with, he has a lab that includes

2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:16.480
 a gym and so he works on endurance and powerlifting and also hypertrophy training, et cetera.

2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:19.240
 But he also does muscle biopsy.

2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:25.800
 So he runs the full spectrum and he's a full tenured professor and he does all this stuff.

2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:32.120
 So he's a really unique person in this whole fitness landscape because there are a lot

2:38:32.120 --> 2:38:33.120
 of PTs out there.

2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:34.560
 There are a lot of kinesiologists.

2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:37.440
 There are a lot of people studying nutrition and sports training.

2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:40.440
 But I think he has the, among the people out there.

2:38:40.440 --> 2:38:46.000
 He's at least in the top five, probably within the top three of people that really have their

2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:50.880
 arms around the full extent of what's possible with training.

2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:53.200
 And he works with the UFC performance center.

2:38:53.200 --> 2:38:59.800
 Well, I mean, he just said a very systematic way of describing things that was really nice.

2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:06.760
 Skill speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscle mass, endurance, all kinds of things.

2:39:06.760 --> 2:39:11.120
 And then the philosophical of like adaptation, how to overload stuff, all that very...

2:39:11.120 --> 2:39:12.120
 Is there stuff...

2:39:12.120 --> 2:39:16.760
 I'll ask you about Ace Bath and Sana, which was surprising to me there.

2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:26.000
 Is there stuff you took away from that conversation, like principles about how to get strong, how

2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:32.400
 to build muscle mass that like broaden and deepen your understanding of that task?

2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:33.400
 Definitely.

2:39:33.400 --> 2:39:36.200
 And I'll do these in bullet points because if people want the logic behind them and the

2:39:36.200 --> 2:39:37.920
 mechanism, they can listen to that episode.

2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:38.920
 Yeah, it's a really good episode.

2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:44.080
 I'll start with heat and cold really quickly and just say that avoid cold immersion.

2:39:44.080 --> 2:39:49.680
 So ice baths and being in cold water up to the neck, uncomfortably cold, within the four

2:39:49.680 --> 2:39:56.320
 hours after a training session that's designed to evoke an adaptation, either endurance,

2:39:56.320 --> 2:40:00.960
 hypertrophy, or strength, because the inflammation that you experience from a hard endurance

2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:05.840
 workout or from a hard strength or a high hypertrophy workout is the stimulus that you're

2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:07.280
 going to adapt to.

2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:13.160
 The cold water immersion reduces inflammation and can short circuit some of that.

2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:16.520
 After four hours, you're probably okay, but if you can do it a different day or you can

2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:19.160
 do it before those sessions, that's better.

2:40:19.160 --> 2:40:23.120
 Heat, however, can be done immediately after training and it's probably beneficial because

2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:28.600
 of the way that it dilates the vascular system and produces the muscles and ligaments, et

2:40:28.600 --> 2:40:29.600
 cetera, with more nutrients.

2:40:29.600 --> 2:40:33.200
 And I should just mention that was a crucial piece of information.

2:40:33.200 --> 2:40:34.980
 It's a little bit surprising.

2:40:34.980 --> 2:40:36.200
 Was it surprising to you?

2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:37.200
 Absolutely.

2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:41.000
 Because the way I posed the question to him about cold was, I hear that getting into an

2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:44.600
 ice bath or a cold water immersion after training can reduce hypertrophy, but I'm guessing

2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:45.600
 it's not that big of a deal.

2:40:45.600 --> 2:40:47.160
 And he said, no, it is a big deal.

2:40:47.160 --> 2:40:48.960
 It will short circuit your progress.

2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:52.480
 Now for people that are only interested in performance who are doing a lot of workouts

2:40:52.480 --> 2:40:56.440
 and trying to recover, but not trying to grow muscle, get stronger, or build endurance,

2:40:56.440 --> 2:40:58.960
 then it makes sense to do cold because it's skill development at some point.

2:40:58.960 --> 2:41:04.360
 Skill development or you're an athlete in season, so what's so great about Andy is he really

2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:08.120
 points out the specific ways to train given your specific goals.

2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:11.600
 So for getting swole, stay out of the ice bath after a workout.

2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:14.520
 Legs is always making fun of the meat heads.

2:41:14.520 --> 2:41:15.520
 I love it.

2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:19.320
 I put myself in the meat head category only because I don't do a real sport now.

2:41:19.320 --> 2:41:23.040
 I work out and I run, which is, I'm an aspiring meat head.

2:41:23.040 --> 2:41:24.040
 Okay.

2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:27.240
 So one of these days I'm going to get back to jujitsu or I'm going to get to jujitsu.

2:41:27.240 --> 2:41:31.800
 Now in terms of training, he has this beautiful three by five concept for strength.

2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:38.200
 Take three exercises, compound exercises, multi joint movements, do them for, do three

2:41:38.200 --> 2:41:47.160
 to five exercises for three to five repetitions per set, rest three to five minutes, and do

2:41:47.160 --> 2:41:49.120
 that three to five times per week.

2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:52.700
 And for details, you can again look to the episode, it's time stamped, but what's interesting

2:41:52.700 --> 2:41:56.680
 about this is three to five times a week is a lot for a muscle group, squatting five

2:41:56.680 --> 2:42:00.920
 times a week for five reps, meaning you're working pretty heavy, meaning you're close

2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:04.920
 to failure but not failure for strength generally.

2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:10.920
 What Andy taught me is that people who are training mostly for strength can do these

2:42:10.920 --> 2:42:17.080
 low rep type regimens frequently because most of the adaptation is neural and because you're

2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:21.920
 not pushing to failure in most cases, you don't get that sore.

2:42:21.920 --> 2:42:28.520
 And so it's the motor neurons getting the muscle fibers to contract more intensely or

2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:32.400
 with more efficiency in other ways that's leading to these strength gains.

2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:37.400
 And this is why power lifters can train every day or five days a week or four days a week.

2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:44.400
 For hypertrophy, I learned from Andy that the repetition range can be pretty broad.

2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:51.560
 You're thinking anywhere from six to 30 repetitions, you should do 10 sets per muscle group per

2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:53.680
 week, maybe even a bit more.

2:42:53.680 --> 2:42:54.680
 So high volume.

2:42:54.680 --> 2:43:01.560
 But you have to go to failure or beyond in order to stimulate growth.

2:43:01.560 --> 2:43:03.960
 Why does it work at such a great range of repetitions?

2:43:03.960 --> 2:43:08.740
 Well, there apparently are three ways that you stimulate hypertrophy and maybe more.

2:43:08.740 --> 2:43:11.480
 One is tissue micro damage to the tissue.

2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:16.960
 The other is through some sort of tension based changes in the molecular gene programs

2:43:16.960 --> 2:43:21.120
 of cells that lead to protein synthesis that are distinct from damage.

2:43:21.120 --> 2:43:26.140
 The other metabolic effects of high repetition work of superfusion of the muscle with blood.

2:43:26.140 --> 2:43:29.400
 We know that third category exists because people are now doing this blood restriction

2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:32.640
 training where they cuff off a muscle and they'll use a really light weight.

2:43:32.640 --> 2:43:33.640
 I've done these before.

2:43:33.640 --> 2:43:37.600
 You can use a five pound weight and do curls with this and you are in pain and the muscles

2:43:37.600 --> 2:43:38.700
 are swelling up with blood.

2:43:38.700 --> 2:43:40.520
 It does lead to hypertrophy.

2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:44.860
 But in general, you're not sore, you're not doing tissue damage.

2:43:44.860 --> 2:43:47.600
 And by the way, don't just turn the kid off a muscle because you have to use the proper

2:43:47.600 --> 2:43:51.480
 cuffs because you need the blood still to flow in one direction, you can't just cinch

2:43:51.480 --> 2:43:56.960
 it off or you'll potentially kill yourself if you get a clot or you do it wrong.

2:43:56.960 --> 2:43:59.600
 So get the appropriate cuffs, they're out there.

2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:01.680
 And then for endurance, I learned something really cool.

2:44:01.680 --> 2:44:06.920
 So I work out basically, I go to the gym every other day on average, three or four days a

2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:09.480
 week I do that, but generally not two days in a row.

2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:11.320
 Work out next day, I'll do cardio next day.

2:44:11.320 --> 2:44:16.920
 And the cardio for me is always a 30 to 45 minute jog, kind of zone two cardio.

2:44:16.920 --> 2:44:21.040
 Everybody informed me that to build endurance while building strength and maintaining some

2:44:21.040 --> 2:44:27.320
 muscle size or even building muscle size, I would be wise to take one day a week and

2:44:27.320 --> 2:44:34.680
 add to that all out max heart rate work for 90 seconds at least.

2:44:34.680 --> 2:44:38.760
 So do 90 seconds then rest and then maybe do another 90 second all out sprint.

2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:41.480
 I almost missed my flight going from Los Angeles to Austin.

2:44:41.480 --> 2:44:44.900
 I did that all out sprint in the airport yesterday.

2:44:44.900 --> 2:44:47.720
 So I actually can think it's done for me.

2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:50.800
 So there was a sprinting Dr.

2:44:50.800 --> 2:44:51.800
 Huberman throughout.

2:44:51.800 --> 2:44:52.800
 With three bags.

2:44:52.800 --> 2:44:53.800
 That's awesome.

2:44:53.800 --> 2:44:57.760
 Because I travel, generally I'll travel with too much stuff.

2:44:57.760 --> 2:45:01.360
 I love how you were probably running late for a flight and used that as an opportunity

2:45:01.360 --> 2:45:02.360
 to explore.

2:45:02.360 --> 2:45:05.840
 Well, as I was doing it, I was thinking to myself, okay, Andy, that's a 90 second sprint

2:45:05.840 --> 2:45:07.760
 because I got to the security line.

2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:08.760
 I finally got TSC.

2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:11.600
 But that's for better, that's for extending endurance.

2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:15.560
 That's for, yeah, it actually has some carryover effects on endurance if you're doing the

2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:16.560
 other stuff.

2:45:16.560 --> 2:45:19.200
 And then he also said one day a week to do this workout and I haven't done it yet.

2:45:19.200 --> 2:45:20.200
 Maybe we do it tomorrow.

2:45:20.200 --> 2:45:21.200
 It'll be fun.

2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:26.560
 Which is you run a mile, you ask yourself, how long did that take?

2:45:26.560 --> 2:45:31.080
 Let's say it took eight minutes, then you walk or rest for eight minutes, then you run

2:45:31.080 --> 2:45:35.120
 another mile as fast as you can and then you rest for the equivalent period and you do

2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:39.200
 that one to three times once per week.

2:45:39.200 --> 2:45:44.040
 And so as an all around fitness program, you could collapse this into something where you

2:45:44.040 --> 2:45:48.200
 say, okay, you're going to work out with the weights for about an hour every other day.

2:45:48.200 --> 2:45:50.000
 Maybe take two days off every once in a while, maybe not.

2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:53.560
 You're going to do six to 15 repetitions.

2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:56.720
 You're going to push to failure on some of those, not all, because some of those are

2:45:56.720 --> 2:45:58.760
 designed to build more strength.

2:45:58.760 --> 2:46:00.360
 You're not going to failure and heavier.

2:46:00.360 --> 2:46:04.040
 Some are designed for hypertrophy, higher rep and going to failure.

2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:07.520
 And then on off days, you're going to jog for 30 to 45 minutes.

2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:12.800
 But for two days a week, you're either at the end of your jog or whatever, you're going

2:46:12.800 --> 2:46:17.920
 to do some all out sprints for 90 seconds and then rest and repeat.

2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:24.240
 And for another day, you're going to do these mile repeats.

2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:27.320
 That's a pretty large chunk of exercise movement.

2:46:27.320 --> 2:46:31.280
 But if you kind of thread through the middle of all that, what you end up with is some

2:46:31.280 --> 2:46:36.680
 decent strength building protocols, some decent hypertrophy, some cardiovascular training

2:46:36.680 --> 2:46:39.680
 that establishes the so called A base or a so called base.

2:46:39.680 --> 2:46:42.120
 So you're not going to get really good at anything.

2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:45.760
 You're not going to become a marathoner this way, an optimizing marathon.

2:46:45.760 --> 2:46:48.800
 You're not going to optimize powerlifting, you're not going to optimize hypertrophy.

2:46:48.800 --> 2:46:53.320
 But for the typical person, 75% of people, 75% of the time, they want some muscle, they

2:46:53.320 --> 2:46:57.200
 want some strength, they want some endurance, and they want the capacity of sprint to the

2:46:57.200 --> 2:47:01.360
 security gate without leaving a lung in the terminal.

2:47:01.360 --> 2:47:03.280
 So it's like functional stuff.

2:47:03.280 --> 2:47:08.280
 Like your life going up the stairs is easier, moving about all the kind of just regular life.

2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:16.520
 And I should mention that cold showers after training don't seem to short circuit the training

2:47:16.520 --> 2:47:19.800
 effect to the same extent that immersion in cold water does.

2:47:19.800 --> 2:47:22.680
 And that really speaks to the fact that cold showers, even though they can provide some

2:47:22.680 --> 2:47:26.080
 of the adrenaline for the mental effects of like, oh, I have a lot of adrenaline in my

2:47:26.080 --> 2:47:30.280
 system from a cold shower and I can remain calm, there's utility to that.

2:47:30.280 --> 2:47:34.320
 It's not going to have the same metabolic effects or other positive effects that cold

2:47:34.320 --> 2:47:36.840
 water exposure has been shown to have.

2:47:36.840 --> 2:47:40.520
 And that's unfortunate because most people have access to cold showers, not everyone

2:47:40.520 --> 2:47:43.080
 has access to a cold dunk or an ice stunk.

2:47:43.080 --> 2:47:47.560
 But here in Austin, you have this place, and no, they don't pay me to say this, but I always

2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:50.280
 like going to this place whenever I'm in town, this place, Cuyah.

2:47:50.280 --> 2:47:54.280
 And they've got a sauna and a couple ice baths and even have those salt tanks that you can

2:47:54.280 --> 2:47:55.280
 float on the surface.

2:47:55.280 --> 2:47:56.280
 Have ice baths there?

2:47:56.280 --> 2:47:58.280
 They have cold water immersion.

2:47:58.280 --> 2:47:59.280
 It's pretty cold.

2:47:59.280 --> 2:48:00.760
 I still haven't done an ice bath.

2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:01.760
 Really?

2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:02.760
 Yeah, I need to.

2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:04.760
 You're rushing, you'll probably get in and you won't even know.

2:48:04.760 --> 2:48:05.760
 Yeah, what is this?

2:48:05.760 --> 2:48:06.760
 What's the big deal here?

2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:07.760
 Exactly.

2:48:07.760 --> 2:48:08.760
 People pay for this.

2:48:08.760 --> 2:48:10.800
 I did a post, right, of you as a baby.

2:48:10.800 --> 2:48:11.800
 Yeah.

2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:18.480
 I had to go deep to get that photo of Lex in a bassinet in the snow because in Russia,

2:48:18.480 --> 2:48:20.800
 they actually did this for a long time.

2:48:20.800 --> 2:48:25.760
 They thought that indeed, it does build the immune system to expose babies to the cold.

2:48:25.760 --> 2:48:27.840
 I still don't know where you got that photo.

2:48:27.840 --> 2:48:29.840
 And then you were able to find exactly the right.

2:48:29.840 --> 2:48:30.840
 It was great.

2:48:30.840 --> 2:48:31.840
 It was great.

2:48:31.840 --> 2:48:36.360
 You didn't have a tie on, but you had all the look and seriousness that you do now.

2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:38.120
 So it's clearly nature nurture.

2:48:38.120 --> 2:48:39.320
 Clearly you were born with that.

2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:40.400
 What about sauna?

2:48:40.400 --> 2:48:42.600
 He does say that it's good to do heat.

2:48:42.600 --> 2:48:46.120
 So there are three ways you can do sauna that I can just toss out as brief things.

2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:50.840
 If you want to get a really big growth hormone release for sake of metabolism, fat loss,

2:48:50.840 --> 2:48:54.720
 you're training really, really hard in jiu jitsu and you want to recover, you don't want

2:48:54.720 --> 2:49:02.400
 to sauna too often because the study that identified this massive 16 fold increase in growth hormone,

2:49:02.400 --> 2:49:04.600
 they had people do this, it's crazy.

2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:09.560
 They got into, okay, temperatures are 80 to 100 degrees centigrade.

2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:16.280
 So that's 176 degrees Fahrenheit to 212 degrees Fahrenheit for five to 30 minutes is the typical

2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:20.360
 ranges that people work in in these research studies.

2:49:20.360 --> 2:49:25.680
 For maximum growth hormone release, don't do sauna more than once a week, but get into

2:49:25.680 --> 2:49:30.040
 the sauna for 30 minutes as hot as you can safely tolerate.

2:49:30.040 --> 2:49:35.040
 So probably for you, that'll be 210 because I suspect you'll be on the high end of things.

2:49:35.040 --> 2:49:40.560
 Then get out for five to 10 minutes, no cold exposure, get back in the sauna for 30 minutes.

2:49:40.560 --> 2:49:44.720
 Then they had them do it again, out for five minutes, back for 30 minutes, out for five

2:49:44.720 --> 2:49:45.720
 minutes, back for 30 minutes.

2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:51.320
 They had them do two hours of sauna exposure to get that growth hormone release.

2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:57.120
 Now for the reduction in likelihood of dying of a cardiovascular event stroke or otherwise,

2:49:57.120 --> 2:49:59.320
 the more often you do sauna, the better.

2:49:59.320 --> 2:50:04.280
 So if you look at all cause mortality or death due to cardiovascular events and you look

2:50:04.280 --> 2:50:09.920
 at sauna use frequencies using the same parameters, 80 to 100 degrees centigrade, one to seven

2:50:09.920 --> 2:50:14.880
 times per week, basically the more often you get into the sauna for 30 minutes across

2:50:14.880 --> 2:50:15.880
 the week.

2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:18.080
 So 30 minutes a day is better than four times a week.

2:50:18.080 --> 2:50:20.840
 Four times a week is better than two times a week and two times a week is better than

2:50:20.840 --> 2:50:21.840
 one.

2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:26.640
 And the reductions in mortality are really impressive.

2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:32.020
 If you get into the sauna the way I just described, not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes twice

2:50:32.020 --> 2:50:36.800
 a week or three times per week, you reduce the likelihood of dying of a cardiovascular

2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:39.080
 event by 27%.

2:50:39.080 --> 2:50:44.760
 If you do it four or more times per week, you reduce the probability of dying by 50%

2:50:44.760 --> 2:50:46.360
 of a cardiovascular event.

2:50:46.360 --> 2:50:50.360
 And in these studies, they rule out other things that people are doing, smoking, they

2:50:50.360 --> 2:50:52.520
 even ask them, do you live in an apartment?

2:50:52.520 --> 2:50:54.120
 Are you in a happy relationship?

2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:57.200
 They evaluate other potentially confounding variables.

2:50:57.200 --> 2:51:01.040
 Now for people that don't have access to a sauna, a hot water bath or hot tub is going

2:51:01.040 --> 2:51:03.120
 to be your next best bet.

2:51:03.120 --> 2:51:07.360
 And if you don't have access to that, do like the wrestlers do, which is put on two sets

2:51:07.360 --> 2:51:13.680
 of sweats and a hoodie and a stocking cap and wrap yourself in plastics underneath all that

2:51:13.680 --> 2:51:17.840
 and go for a run, but don't, please, nobody die of hyperthermia, I mean, you can die of

2:51:17.840 --> 2:51:18.840
 warming up too much.

2:51:18.840 --> 2:51:26.560
 Is this experience pleasant or stressful in the way, so is it as stressful as an ice

2:51:26.560 --> 2:51:27.560
 bath, for example?

2:51:27.560 --> 2:51:29.120
 Okay, great question.

2:51:29.120 --> 2:51:33.200
 People always ask how cold to make the ice bath or the cold water or the shower.

2:51:33.200 --> 2:51:37.880
 You want it to be uncomfortably cold, meaning you want to feel like, I really want to get

2:51:37.880 --> 2:51:42.160
 out, but you can safely stay in, and that's going to vary by person and experience with

2:51:42.160 --> 2:51:43.160
 it.

2:51:43.160 --> 2:51:46.680
 But with the sauna, it's the same thing.

2:51:46.680 --> 2:51:47.680
 How hot to make it?

2:51:47.680 --> 2:51:50.920
 Well, don't kill yourself, obviously, be smart.

2:51:50.920 --> 2:51:54.240
 If you're pregnant, you shouldn't be doing this anyway.

2:51:54.240 --> 2:51:58.680
 But it's very clear that what you need is the release of something called dinorphin.

2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:00.800
 We have endorphin, which makes us feel good.

2:52:00.800 --> 2:52:04.380
 It binds to these mu opioid receptors in the body.

2:52:04.380 --> 2:52:08.280
 You have dinorphin, which is the terrible feeling that you get when you're in really

2:52:08.280 --> 2:52:09.560
 hot temperatures.

2:52:09.560 --> 2:52:14.280
 It's also the terrible effect that alcoholics feel when they are in withdrawal.

2:52:14.280 --> 2:52:15.280
 You feel agitated.

2:52:15.280 --> 2:52:16.280
 You want to get out.

2:52:16.280 --> 2:52:17.280
 It's really unpleasant.

2:52:17.280 --> 2:52:21.040
 It's dinorphin binding to the so called Kappa opioid receptor.

2:52:21.040 --> 2:52:22.440
 That's what you're trying to trigger.

2:52:22.440 --> 2:52:24.320
 When you do that, a number of things happen.

2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:29.760
 You set off heat shock proteins that go repair broken proteins and misfolded proteins.

2:52:29.760 --> 2:52:34.640
 It also makes it so that later endorphin binds its receptor more strongly.

2:52:34.640 --> 2:52:39.920
 So when you have this uncomfortable experience in the heat, you literally feel better in

2:52:39.920 --> 2:52:44.480
 real life when pleasurable vents come on, when you experience them.

2:52:44.480 --> 2:52:47.840
 In the same way, I like to say this, that when you get into a cold ice bath or cold

2:52:47.840 --> 2:52:54.720
 shower, the increase in epinephrine and dopamine is two to 300%.

2:52:54.720 --> 2:52:57.240
 These are huge increases and they last many hours.

2:52:57.240 --> 2:53:02.880
 This is shown because lately I've gotten a little bit of pushback on Twitter, which

2:53:02.880 --> 2:53:06.320
 is interesting place.

2:53:06.320 --> 2:53:07.480
 People say, well, that's just in mice.

2:53:07.480 --> 2:53:11.600
 No, all the studies I just referred to are all done in humans, men and women, fairly

2:53:11.600 --> 2:53:13.040
 broad age ranges.

2:53:13.040 --> 2:53:15.320
 So you want to be uncomfortable in the cold.

2:53:15.320 --> 2:53:17.240
 You want to be uncomfortable in the heat.

2:53:17.240 --> 2:53:21.000
 This is why I'm not a big fan of infrared saunas because they only go up to about 160,

2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:23.280
 170 degrees.

2:53:23.280 --> 2:53:27.560
 Infrared light and far red light of all kinds has been shown to be beneficial for wound

2:53:27.560 --> 2:53:29.880
 healing, acne, skin, eyes.

2:53:29.880 --> 2:53:34.320
 You're even guys now putting on their testicles because it can increase testosterone and sperm

2:53:34.320 --> 2:53:35.320
 production.

2:53:35.320 --> 2:53:36.320
 Yeah, hormone release.

2:53:36.320 --> 2:53:37.320
 Hormone release.

2:53:37.320 --> 2:53:41.480
 But in terms of the sauna, you want that strong heat stimulus.

2:53:41.480 --> 2:53:42.480
 Yeah.

2:53:42.480 --> 2:53:45.680
 And that's when you crawl up to the 200 mark and so on.

2:53:45.680 --> 2:53:48.120
 Whenever I'm in New York and there's also one in San Francisco, although the one in

2:53:48.120 --> 2:53:52.040
 San Francisco is clothing optional just to warn people, there's a place called Archimedes

2:53:52.040 --> 2:53:53.040
 Bania.

2:53:53.040 --> 2:53:57.640
 Is there any scientific evidence that being naked is beneficial in the sauna?

2:53:57.640 --> 2:54:00.440
 Well, in certain contexts, it leads to childbirth.

2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:01.440
 Okay.

2:54:01.440 --> 2:54:03.000
 I'll have to read up on that.

2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:04.000
 I read that somewhere.

2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:05.000
 Yeah.

2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:08.800
 But I suppose it's not required for childbirth.

2:54:08.800 --> 2:54:12.480
 But in all seriousness, in New York, I'll go to a place called Spa 88.

2:54:12.480 --> 2:54:14.680
 And actually, Khabib's picture is on the wall.

2:54:14.680 --> 2:54:15.680
 He goes there.

2:54:15.680 --> 2:54:16.680
 Oh.

2:54:16.680 --> 2:54:18.180
 And that one, it's clothing.

2:54:18.180 --> 2:54:19.180
 They require clothing.

2:54:19.180 --> 2:54:22.000
 I only just say that because it can be a little bit of a shock to people sometimes if they

2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:25.480
 kind of walk in there, a bunch of naked people, the one in San Francisco.

2:54:25.480 --> 2:54:29.800
 If I go, I'm clothed mostly because I run into coworkers or things like that.

2:54:29.800 --> 2:54:33.960
 I sort of wore old fashioned in that way, I suppose.

2:54:33.960 --> 2:54:36.560
 But you like to wear clothes around coworkers?

2:54:36.560 --> 2:54:37.560
 Yes.

2:54:37.560 --> 2:54:38.560
 Very old fashioned.

2:54:38.560 --> 2:54:39.560
 Yeah.

2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:41.520
 I mean, to me, it just seems like just be aware.

2:54:41.520 --> 2:54:46.320
 But nonetheless, the Banias have very hot saunas because they're Russian owned.

2:54:46.320 --> 2:54:50.560
 And in New York, there's one on the Lower East Side, but the Spa 88 place, they have

2:54:50.560 --> 2:54:55.680
 some saunas that the moment I get into those, I have a hard time catching a full breath.

2:54:55.680 --> 2:54:56.680
 It burns.

2:54:56.680 --> 2:54:59.480
 They've got a cold dunk that's like a shock.

2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:02.820
 And then they've got a sauna, a wet sauna steam room that's a little mellower.

2:55:02.820 --> 2:55:05.840
 So the nice thing about a Banias, you can kind of find your place.

2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:10.640
 And then they do the plaza where they take the eucalyptus leaves and you can pay someone

2:55:10.640 --> 2:55:15.800
 and you basically, you cover your groin and then they beat you with the leaves.

2:55:15.800 --> 2:55:17.640
 And it's supposed to bring the vasculature to the surface.

2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:22.360
 I've only done it once and frankly, I found it to be a little bit unnerving.

2:55:22.360 --> 2:55:26.640
 I didn't really like the experience, but I, I'll try and get into a sauna as often as

2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:30.600
 I possibly can, which is, you know, once or three times per week.

2:55:30.600 --> 2:55:36.120
 And I try and do the cold exposure, shower or immersion, but early in the day because

2:55:36.120 --> 2:55:37.920
 it really wakes you up.

2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:43.600
 One of my favorite things I've listened to, I wish there was a video is listening to a

2:55:43.600 --> 2:55:48.440
 bunch of stuff with Rick Rubin and he did a thing with Tim Ferriss, like the Tim Ferriss

2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:49.440
 podcast.

2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:55.160
 I don't know if you've ever heard it, but he, he forced him to do, they did the podcast

2:55:55.160 --> 2:55:56.160
 in a sauna.

2:55:56.160 --> 2:55:57.160
 Uh huh.

2:55:57.160 --> 2:56:00.280
 And I don't think at the time Tim Ferriss was adapted.

2:56:00.280 --> 2:56:01.280
 Yeah.

2:56:01.280 --> 2:56:03.360
 If you're not heat adapted, it can be pretty stressful.

2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:07.120
 And I mean, obviously the whole experience is stressful as a, as somebody with, with

2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:09.400
 microphones, like what, what is happening.

2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:15.920
 But I just love that Tim was vulnerable enough to kind of give themselves over to whatever

2:56:15.920 --> 2:56:17.400
 the hell this experience is.

2:56:17.400 --> 2:56:24.720
 And I, I'm just so happy that Rick won't like push that kind of idea and just let's, let's

2:56:24.720 --> 2:56:25.720
 do it.

2:56:25.720 --> 2:56:27.720
 That's a very Rick Rubin kind of thing to do.

2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:31.600
 And we must not, like we must do this, this has to be done.

2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:35.760
 A podcast that was done from a sauna continuously would be really interesting.

2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:37.600
 Like you could call it like the pressure cooker or something.

2:56:37.600 --> 2:56:38.920
 Oh, I mean like a regular podcast.

2:56:38.920 --> 2:56:39.920
 Yeah.

2:56:39.920 --> 2:56:43.600
 Like you have to sit with your guests in the sauna or they have to sit in the sauna without

2:56:43.600 --> 2:56:44.600
 those.

2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:48.440
 One of the interesting things is, um, it was a sad thing because I believe there's no

2:56:48.440 --> 2:56:55.160
 video of that podcast, but you could tell there was a kind of, there was suffering on

2:56:55.160 --> 2:56:56.160
 this person.

2:56:56.160 --> 2:56:57.160
 Oh, sure.

2:56:57.160 --> 2:56:59.040
 It was like a degradation.

2:56:59.040 --> 2:57:04.480
 He started over time not being able to put words together correctly, which he's very

2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:05.480
 eloquent.

2:57:05.480 --> 2:57:12.120
 And so you could see there's like, there's a struggle, heat and cold pull you down from

2:57:12.120 --> 2:57:13.120
 the inside.

2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:17.040
 You have to, I mean, there's a reason why the screening process for, um, make, you

2:57:17.040 --> 2:57:20.720
 know, seal, seal, they call it seal training, but it's really screening and training involves

2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:21.720
 cold waters.

2:57:21.720 --> 2:57:25.800
 Cause you know, if you're in the heat too long, you'll die or damage tissue in cold.

2:57:25.800 --> 2:57:30.120
 You can do it quite extensively before you die or damage tissue, but it is stressful.

2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:35.160
 I was going to say one thing that, um, I sometimes enjoy seeing these social media posts where

2:57:35.160 --> 2:57:39.280
 people will get into the ice bath and they'll look really stoic, like they're really tough.

2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:44.440
 Um, but actually that's the wimpy way to go through it.

2:57:44.440 --> 2:57:50.520
 When you get into cold water, if you stay very still, you develop a thermal sheath around

2:57:50.520 --> 2:57:53.640
 you that you're warming yourself.

2:57:53.640 --> 2:57:58.280
 The really bold way is to get in and continue to sift your arms and legs and it ends up

2:57:58.280 --> 2:58:01.120
 feeling miserably colder.

2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:04.800
 And then there's no sheath because you're breaking up that thermal layer.

2:58:04.800 --> 2:58:08.600
 And then when you get out, you'll notice a lot of people huddle or they'll, they'll put

2:58:08.600 --> 2:58:10.240
 or they'll grab the towel in general.

2:58:10.240 --> 2:58:11.240
 That's me.

2:58:11.240 --> 2:58:12.800
 I'll get back, I'll get into the sauna.

2:58:12.800 --> 2:58:17.080
 But if you really want to stimulate the big increases in metabolism, you stand out there

2:58:17.080 --> 2:58:20.880
 and you dry off with arms extended in open air.

2:58:20.880 --> 2:58:25.400
 And as that water evaporates off you, it is really cold, but your body is forced to activate

2:58:25.400 --> 2:58:28.560
 a number of the warming programs related to metabolism.

2:58:28.560 --> 2:58:32.520
 This is the beautiful work of a woman named Susanna Soberg who's, um, Scandinavian.

2:58:32.520 --> 2:58:36.200
 She published this paper last year in Cell Reports Medicine and so I call this the Soberg

2:58:36.200 --> 2:58:40.760
 principle, which is if you're doing ice and heat for whatever reason, it doesn't matter

2:58:40.760 --> 2:58:45.160
 if you end on heat or cold, but if you're using cold specifically to stimulate an increase

2:58:45.160 --> 2:58:50.240
 in metabolism and with cold, that's the Soberg principle.

2:58:50.240 --> 2:58:55.480
 And with cold, if you're alternating and then, uh, if you want to do it the tough way, you

2:58:55.480 --> 2:58:59.040
 let the shivering, sort of you just stand out and let the water evaporate.

2:58:59.040 --> 2:59:00.040
 Yeah.

2:59:00.040 --> 2:59:02.040
 I mean, if you ever waded into a cold ocean, you know, everybody's kind of like, you know,

2:59:02.040 --> 2:59:06.040
 everybody's kind of like holding themselves, you know, if you really just, if you let yourself

2:59:06.040 --> 2:59:11.320
 extend your limbs and move them around a bit, so you break up that thermal layer, uh, that's,

2:59:11.320 --> 2:59:12.320
 that's the tough way to do it.

2:59:12.320 --> 2:59:14.920
 So when I see people on social media getting in and they're like really tough and trying

2:59:14.920 --> 2:59:15.920
 to look hard.

2:59:15.920 --> 2:59:16.920
 Yeah.

2:59:16.920 --> 2:59:17.920
 You want to be moving around.

2:59:17.920 --> 2:59:18.920
 Yeah.

2:59:18.920 --> 2:59:21.920
 It's smiling, talking, moving around is way, way colder.

2:59:21.920 --> 2:59:22.920
 Yeah.

2:59:22.920 --> 2:59:23.920
 Are you able to talk?

2:59:23.920 --> 2:59:25.120
 Can you do it?

2:59:25.120 --> 2:59:27.880
 So you suggest the podcast in the, in the sauna.

2:59:27.880 --> 2:59:28.880
 How about this?

2:59:28.880 --> 2:59:31.080
 I propose this since I got you want to do the next podcast.

2:59:31.080 --> 2:59:35.880
 I'll get to, so the folks from the plunge, uh, maybe could bring Lexa a plunge.

2:59:35.880 --> 2:59:40.640
 He certainly deserves one and, uh, we can go side by side coffin style or we can face

2:59:40.640 --> 2:59:41.640
 one another.

2:59:41.640 --> 2:59:42.640
 Yeah.

2:59:42.640 --> 2:59:45.960
 What we said, we should do each other's podcast and maybe next, I can't wait to have you back

2:59:45.960 --> 2:59:46.960
 on.

2:59:46.960 --> 2:59:47.960
 I mean, we only scratch the surface.

2:59:47.960 --> 2:59:51.360
 Well, let's do at least part of the next human lab podcast either.

2:59:51.360 --> 2:59:52.720
 I have a sauna and a cold plunge.

2:59:52.720 --> 2:59:53.720
 So we could do.

2:59:53.720 --> 2:59:54.720
 Yeah.

2:59:54.720 --> 2:59:55.720
 Yeah.

2:59:55.720 --> 2:59:56.720
 We could do.

2:59:56.720 --> 2:59:57.720
 We do a sauna and a cold plunge version.

2:59:57.720 --> 2:59:59.640
 I wonder the recording, how the recording works.

2:59:59.640 --> 3:00:04.160
 A bit of an echo in the sauna, but I'm sure we can take out the reaver.

3:00:04.160 --> 3:00:11.720
 So Sergey wants to ask you about sex performance, uh, very journalistic, very hardcore, hitting

3:00:11.720 --> 3:00:13.600
 questions that we have here in the book.

3:00:13.600 --> 3:00:16.760
 Generally or a specific, uh, no, he has a certain problem.

3:00:16.760 --> 3:00:21.400
 He needs help with no, uh, generally you haven't done an episode on sex.

3:00:21.400 --> 3:00:24.560
 Well, we did an episode early on on sexual development.

3:00:24.560 --> 3:00:25.560
 Yes.

3:00:25.560 --> 3:00:28.680
 We've done them on optimizing testosterone and estrogen and we touched a little bit

3:00:28.680 --> 3:00:35.000
 on the, uh, on libido and somewhat on sex performance, but not much.

3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:40.800
 We did an episode on relationships, love and desire where we touched on libido specifically.

3:00:40.800 --> 3:00:46.000
 So just as a quick mention of something, uh, a lot of people take SSRIs or antidepressants

3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:48.000
 that can disrupt sexual function.

3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:52.840
 There are a few compounds like Makarut and Ponga Ali and things like that, that at least

3:00:52.840 --> 3:00:58.800
 in a few studies in humans have been shown to offset some of the, the sexual side effects.

3:00:58.800 --> 3:01:03.400
 Now in terms of sexual, and then the, sorry, the episode on sexual development was about

3:01:03.400 --> 3:01:08.280
 how the brain and body become organized in certain ways, how the brain becomes organized

3:01:08.280 --> 3:01:11.200
 if you have X chromosomes or Y chromosomes or et cetera.

3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:12.280
 So early, early development.

3:01:12.280 --> 3:01:16.760
 Early development mainly and the effects of hormones later on that template.

3:01:16.760 --> 3:01:23.440
 We will be doing a, I'm actually putting together a, a series on sexual health, everything

3:01:23.440 --> 3:01:29.640
 from the menstrual cycle, which both men and women should understand of course, um, understanding

3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:34.200
 arousal, understanding, for instance, a lot of people don't realize this, but that, um,

3:01:34.200 --> 3:01:40.200
 orgasm is actually the consequence of activity in the sympathetic, meaning the stress arm

3:01:40.200 --> 3:01:46.840
 of the autonomic nervous system, whereas arousal is the consequence of the activity of the

3:01:46.840 --> 3:01:52.840
 parasympathetic, the calming aspect of the, of, uh, uh, the auto as contraintuitive, right?

3:01:52.840 --> 3:01:53.840
 It's counterintuitive.

3:01:53.840 --> 3:01:54.840
 And it kind of works like a seesaw.

3:01:54.840 --> 3:01:59.000
 I mean, there's arousal, then there's relaxation, then there's arousal, but the, um, and then

3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:04.960
 immediately after orgasm and in males ejaculation, what ends up happening is there's a rebounding

3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:09.040
 of the parasympathetic nervous system, which it leads to oftentimes people feeling very

3:02:09.040 --> 3:02:11.520
 relaxed or falling asleep.

3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:16.920
 So I'm going to do a short series on sexual health that will be, that will include stuff

3:02:16.920 --> 3:02:24.000
 about sexual performance, but also, um, some, uh, I'm working on getting an expert guest

3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:28.880
 who can talk about some of the neurologic changes that happen, um, as a consequence of

3:02:28.880 --> 3:02:30.600
 sexual activity.

3:02:30.600 --> 3:02:36.280
 And we did an episode with a guy from UT Austin here, David Bus, who's evolutionary psychologist

3:02:36.280 --> 3:02:42.320
 talking about, um, it went pretty deep into some of the, uh, typical and unusual dynamics

3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:47.000
 of mating relation, um, whether or not people have kids or not and what impacts that.

3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:49.800
 But we're going to do an episode on menopause, andropause.

3:02:49.800 --> 3:02:54.120
 What's very surprising is I get a lot of questions about sexual health from the young

3:02:54.120 --> 3:03:00.240
 male audience, um, which tells me that, well, here's what I think it reflects.

3:03:00.240 --> 3:03:05.600
 I think that women, because of their menstrual cycles, early on starts to talk to one another

3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:09.800
 about changes in physiology and psychology as a function of this 28 day cycle that they

3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:12.200
 all experience sooner or later.

3:03:12.200 --> 3:03:15.960
 Males, there's less of a conversation and it usually arrives in code.

3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:18.120
 People will say, Hey, what should I take to increase my testosterone?

3:03:18.120 --> 3:03:23.760
 And I'll say, well, maybe nothing, you know, uh, what are you specifically concerned about?

3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:28.600
 And then over time, if you pull on those threads a little bit, you know, you get your answer.

3:03:28.600 --> 3:03:30.840
 Sometimes I'll just get a direct question.

3:03:30.840 --> 3:03:35.400
 But I think that, uh, the psychology of all this and in terms of jealousy and the terms

3:03:35.400 --> 3:03:40.520
 of, um, notions of, of, uh, roles and relationships is very dynamic right now.

3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:41.720
 And I'm fascinated by this.

3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:43.800
 So we're going to do a four episode series.

3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:49.720
 What about sexual fantasy, what, uh, to get Freudian for a second, what role does sexual

3:03:49.720 --> 3:03:52.960
 fantasy have in the human condition?

3:03:52.960 --> 3:03:55.200
 There's a book called the erotic imagination.

3:03:55.200 --> 3:04:00.920
 It's a very psychoanalytic book written by a psychoanalyst that talks about, um, how,

3:04:00.920 --> 3:04:03.440
 well, here's the uncomfortable reality.

3:04:03.440 --> 3:04:07.680
 Freud was at least right about one thing, which is that the brain circuitry that you

3:04:07.680 --> 3:04:14.480
 used to develop attachments to your caregivers, mother and father or other caregivers, do

3:04:14.480 --> 3:04:16.800
 not disappear when you hit puberty.

3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:20.560
 They are repurposed for romantic and sexual relations.

3:04:20.560 --> 3:04:25.440
 And so this is why the whole notion of anxious attached and secure attached, you know, stems

3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:29.880
 from childhood attachment patterns, but it carries over to romantic relationships.

3:04:29.880 --> 3:04:32.120
 So that the relationship with your mother has

3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:33.120
 And father.

3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:40.760
 And father has a, and probably other close people to you in your young age has a secondary

3:04:40.760 --> 3:04:45.240
 tertiary, some kind of ripple effect on how your sexuality developed, like what fantasies

3:04:45.240 --> 3:04:46.240
 you might have all that.

3:04:46.240 --> 3:04:47.400
 Oh, without question.

3:04:47.400 --> 3:04:51.880
 And of course, early experiences too, and traumatic or positive or neutral.

3:04:51.880 --> 3:04:55.480
 The thing that's really important to remember though, in this transfer of circuitry from

3:04:55.480 --> 3:05:01.600
 one role to another is that, and it's certainly consistent with psychoanalysis that gender

3:05:01.600 --> 3:05:04.880
 is interchangeable, sex is interchangeable.

3:05:04.880 --> 3:05:08.600
 So for instance, let's say you had a wonderful relationship, let's say this, let's take a

3:05:08.600 --> 3:05:14.400
 hypothetical person, okay, I'm truly not referring to myself, let's take a young woman who has

3:05:14.400 --> 3:05:19.480
 a wonderful relationship to her father, and a just absolutely terrible abusive relationship

3:05:19.480 --> 3:05:26.280
 to her mother, just for sake of example, she then goes into adulthood, and she is drawn

3:05:26.280 --> 3:05:32.280
 to very abusive men, not always, but let's just use in this example.

3:05:32.280 --> 3:05:36.320
 And the dynamic is exactly the same as the dynamic she had with her mother.

3:05:36.320 --> 3:05:40.680
 That's actually a common occurrence, even though in this context, she's heterosexual,

3:05:40.680 --> 3:05:42.160
 she's romantically attracted to men.

3:05:42.160 --> 3:05:46.160
 What is seen over and over again is that the dynamic with one parent can be transferred

3:05:46.160 --> 3:05:51.200
 on to a romantic dynamic, but it doesn't have to be that if it was with the mother, then

3:05:51.200 --> 3:05:53.520
 it only has to do with relationships to women.

3:05:53.520 --> 3:05:59.280
 So gender is interchangeable because these circuitries are presexual, they're laid down

3:05:59.280 --> 3:06:04.320
 in our brain before the brain has any concept of sexual interactions.

3:06:04.320 --> 3:06:06.760
 It's preverbal, excuse me.

3:06:06.760 --> 3:06:12.440
 And so there are a lot of interesting examples and data to support this.

3:06:12.440 --> 3:06:16.760
 The book Attached is a pretty interesting book by two psychologists, one I think is

3:06:16.760 --> 3:06:24.680
 at Columbia University, that talks about how childhood dynamics carry over to adult romantic

3:06:24.680 --> 3:06:25.800
 attachment.

3:06:25.800 --> 3:06:29.720
 So as you can tell, I get pretty alert in response to these questions, they get a lot

3:06:29.720 --> 3:06:34.360
 of them relate in this domain and they have a lot of impact on people and they were wondering

3:06:34.360 --> 3:06:35.360
 about they want to learn.

3:06:35.360 --> 3:06:37.920
 And no one knows what other people are doing or what's normal.

3:06:37.920 --> 3:06:43.440
 We kind of know deviancy, we know perversion, we know the extremes, we know the rules, hopefully

3:06:43.440 --> 3:06:52.280
 people know the rules, but there are a lot of people in the academic community, in particular

3:06:52.280 --> 3:06:57.680
 at certain East Coast schools not to be named, that are in open relationships.

3:06:57.680 --> 3:07:00.120
 This is more common now.

3:07:00.120 --> 3:07:03.680
 It's not very common, but it's more common.

3:07:03.680 --> 3:07:08.680
 And you know, obviously that's a way of bypassing some of these more primitive emotions about

3:07:08.680 --> 3:07:13.880
 jealousy, et cetera, and leveraging them towards maybe even ongoing relationships.

3:07:13.880 --> 3:07:16.040
 I'm not passing judgment one way or the other.

3:07:16.040 --> 3:07:20.920
 I always say four conditions have to be met for any discussion about sex and sexuality

3:07:20.920 --> 3:07:27.600
 or sexual health, age appropriate, context appropriate, consensual, and species appropriate.

3:07:27.600 --> 3:07:34.240
 Well, that's weird because the thing I'm trying to figure out is why my sexual fantasy is

3:07:34.240 --> 3:07:43.400
 to go to furry orgies and have sex with others dressed as squirrels and me, other animals.

3:07:43.400 --> 3:07:48.240
 So that could be, I'll see a therapist about that one.

3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:53.640
 I'm not going to respond to that except to say that as long as those four conditions

3:07:53.640 --> 3:07:57.960
 are met, consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate.

3:07:57.960 --> 3:08:01.000
 So there's a bunch of questions on Instagram.

3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:07.600
 One of them on this topic, on relationships, somebody suggested to do a part three of why

3:08:07.600 --> 3:08:08.680
 Lex is single.

3:08:08.680 --> 3:08:12.400
 There's a running joke about this.

3:08:12.400 --> 3:08:14.880
 But I can answer it in part, right?

3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:21.800
 Because partially because you're very busy, partially because you've decided that until

3:08:21.800 --> 3:08:26.000
 it's time, you're going to wait until it's time.

3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:27.000
 It's time, right?

3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:28.280
 I mean, until it's time you're waiting.

3:08:28.280 --> 3:08:32.880
 And then, I mean, you're not saving yourself for marriage, I don't think.

3:08:32.880 --> 3:08:37.400
 But in some sense, yeah, your future wife is out there.

3:08:37.400 --> 3:08:38.400
 Oh, yeah.

3:08:38.400 --> 3:08:39.400
 Yeah.

3:08:39.400 --> 3:08:40.400
 She's being programmed.

3:08:40.400 --> 3:08:41.400
 No.

3:08:41.400 --> 3:08:43.080
 I mean, I definitely believe that.

3:08:43.080 --> 3:08:47.160
 I mean, first of all, I just love people and I fall in love very easily with people,

3:08:47.160 --> 3:08:50.240
 with objects, with things, with life, with every moment.

3:08:50.240 --> 3:08:55.800
 That way, you're like Oliver Sacks, he would fall in love with minerals and concepts and

3:08:55.800 --> 3:08:56.800
 things like that.

3:08:56.800 --> 3:09:08.480
 And so, to me, this relationship is more like a commitment to one particular kind of object

3:09:08.480 --> 3:09:11.280
 of your love.

3:09:11.280 --> 3:09:16.520
 It's almost like a journey that you take on together because also the interesting thing

3:09:16.520 --> 3:09:22.680
 about humans is their moment by moment, a different person, day by day, week by week,

3:09:22.680 --> 3:09:26.760
 month by month, they change, they evolve, there's an ups and downs and stuff like that.

3:09:26.760 --> 3:09:31.600
 So, what you're doing is you're saying, well, I'm going to explore all the way that this

3:09:31.600 --> 3:09:38.800
 human gets morphed and changed and what makes them cry, what makes them excited, what makes

3:09:38.800 --> 3:09:48.040
 them lonely, like the habits, like when they form certain habits, how they feel when those

3:09:48.040 --> 3:09:52.960
 habits are broken, like the stupid minute things that make everyday life, you're going

3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:57.320
 to be on that journey together, figuring that out, just the way we're trying to figure ourselves

3:09:57.320 --> 3:10:01.560
 out when we're optimizing these things about diet and health and so on.

3:10:01.560 --> 3:10:06.000
 You're kind of doing this computation together because neither person really understands

3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:12.000
 themselves at all and you're together, both confused about each other and you get to almost

3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:22.560
 like a relationship as a chance to understand yourself and to understand another person

3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:23.560
 like together.

3:10:23.560 --> 3:10:26.000
 That process is somehow iterative.

3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:27.000
 You know the dynamics, right?

3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:29.440
 I mean, you're merging two nervous systems.

3:10:29.440 --> 3:10:34.480
 This was once described to me very well by an ex girlfriend who's truly brilliant.

3:10:34.480 --> 3:10:39.600
 She said, you know, there's four arrows.

3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:43.160
 This is maybe to an engineer or like a, so it makes sense.

3:10:43.160 --> 3:10:45.520
 There's how you feel towards the other person.

3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:47.520
 There's how they feel towards you.

3:10:47.520 --> 3:10:53.920
 But then there's an arrow that comes back to you, which is how you feel about how they

3:10:53.920 --> 3:10:58.040
 feel and then they have an arrow of how they feel about how you feel, right?

3:10:58.040 --> 3:11:03.240
 This is why if someone else is moody or somebody else is upset, there's one version of ourselves

3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:06.440
 where we respond to that or they respond to us.

3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:11.520
 But there's another version where we respond to that, but it's also there's a processing

3:11:11.520 --> 3:11:15.600
 of what it means for us that they're behaving that way or feeling that way.

3:11:15.600 --> 3:11:21.760
 And this again leads us back to that early attachment circuitry because if a parent was

3:11:21.760 --> 3:11:25.360
 stressed, the child's role is not to soothe the parent.

3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:29.600
 In fact, healthy models of parenting say that children shouldn't actually know how their

3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:32.960
 parents feel for like the first eight years of their life.

3:11:32.960 --> 3:11:36.040
 They're not supposed to be in that mindset of empathizing for the parent.

3:11:36.040 --> 3:11:38.000
 This is often not the case.

3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:41.400
 But maybe the cutoff isn't exactly eight, but you get the idea.

3:11:41.400 --> 3:11:45.480
 So the dynamics of relationship are where the learning is because we learn how we react

3:11:45.480 --> 3:11:47.040
 to other people reacting.

3:11:47.040 --> 3:11:52.480
 It's not just a two arrow system, it's at least this four arrow thing.

3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:55.080
 But there's also the element of nurturing, right?

3:11:55.080 --> 3:11:59.240
 I mean, I think that going through life with somebody is so much better than going through

3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:04.280
 it alone, and I never thought I'd make that statement.

3:12:04.280 --> 3:12:05.840
 So it wasn't always obvious to you?

3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:07.520
 No, it wasn't always obvious to me.

3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:13.720
 I mean, I've really enjoyed wonderful relationships, and some have been hard, and there's certainly

3:12:13.720 --> 3:12:14.720
 been a lot of growth.

3:12:14.720 --> 3:12:20.480
 I'm on good terms with almost all my former girlfriends and close with some enough that

3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:25.760
 I know their spouses and I'm close with their families, but no, it wasn't.

3:12:25.760 --> 3:12:31.760
 And I think that when people say relationship is hard, the only really hard part of a good

3:12:31.760 --> 3:12:36.360
 relationship is just dealing with oneself and making sure that you're staying in that

3:12:36.360 --> 3:12:41.400
 mode of caretaking, because I do believe that if one is mainly focused on taking good care

3:12:41.400 --> 3:12:46.720
 of the other person, provided they're also focused on taking good care of you, to some

3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:50.400
 extent, and we're good at taking care of ourselves, everybody flourishes.

3:12:50.400 --> 3:12:51.400
 Everything gets better.

3:12:51.400 --> 3:12:55.000
 But no, I don't think I experienced that until fairly recently.

3:12:55.000 --> 3:13:03.040
 What do you think is the secret to a successful relationship?

3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:14.400
 There isn't just one, but at least in the top five is master or at least be good at

3:13:14.400 --> 3:13:20.520
 autonomic self regulation, know how to calm yourself down, don't expect the like looking

3:13:20.520 --> 3:13:24.960
 to anything external to soothe yourself as it puts you in a terrible position to be a

3:13:24.960 --> 3:13:27.800
 caretaker of yourself and other people.

3:13:27.800 --> 3:13:32.640
 So learn how to self soothe, learn how to calm your mind, steady your actions, steady

3:13:32.640 --> 3:13:33.640
 your voice.

3:13:33.640 --> 3:13:34.640
 There are tools to do that.

3:13:34.640 --> 3:13:36.880
 We talk about on the podcast, but elsewhere have that in place.

3:13:36.880 --> 3:13:44.000
 I also think that if your main focus is on you want to have good boundaries, et cetera,

3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:48.000
 but on tending to the relationship, doing a little bit more than you think you ought

3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:50.920
 to do, if everyone does that, it goes great.

3:13:50.920 --> 3:13:57.960
 I'm sometimes so positively struck by how supported I feel because for many years, I

3:13:57.960 --> 3:13:59.720
 was just kind of doing everything on my own.

3:13:59.720 --> 3:14:02.920
 So any little thing, I'm like, oh my goodness, this feels huge.

3:14:02.920 --> 3:14:05.120
 And also I think the dynamics have to be right.

3:14:05.120 --> 3:14:06.120
 Let's be really honest.

3:14:06.120 --> 3:14:14.320
 This is a little bit of a tricky topic, but there is a power dynamic in relationships.

3:14:14.320 --> 3:14:18.560
 It's not all, but in some relationships, it works much better if one person leads and

3:14:18.560 --> 3:14:21.160
 the other person follows.

3:14:21.160 --> 3:14:25.000
 In other relationships, it's more mutuality, works best.

3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:26.960
 People need to know what they need.

3:14:26.960 --> 3:14:30.240
 And so knowing what you need and what you crave is really important.

3:14:30.240 --> 3:14:33.360
 And then once you do that, you can create the relationship you want.

3:14:33.360 --> 3:14:37.320
 I've seen that over and over again, and people are different.

3:14:37.320 --> 3:14:44.880
 But I think that ultimately, there's the dopamine phase of a relationship, and then

3:14:44.880 --> 3:14:49.120
 there's the serotonin phase, the kind of more mutuality, coziness, and sweetness.

3:14:49.120 --> 3:14:55.920
 There's a great book about how to make sure that the dopamine component and the serotonin

3:14:55.920 --> 3:14:58.640
 component, so to speak, go on forever.

3:14:58.640 --> 3:15:01.720
 And it has to do with, when you first meet someone and you're attracted to them, you're

3:15:01.720 --> 3:15:07.240
 essentially objectifying them, meaning, not in the way people might think.

3:15:07.240 --> 3:15:11.800
 You are not dependent on them for emotional stability or survival.

3:15:11.800 --> 3:15:15.920
 As you get close to somebody, you really come to depend on them, and then you tend to objectify

3:15:15.920 --> 3:15:16.920
 them less.

3:15:16.920 --> 3:15:20.360
 And so this book, the name is kind of corny, but it's written by an analyst again, it's

3:15:20.360 --> 3:15:21.880
 called Can Love Last?

3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:27.360
 And it's a book about how really good, strong relationships are the consequence of people

3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:33.420
 constantly moving through this dependency objectification dynamic.

3:15:33.420 --> 3:15:38.080
 And I use those words in the psychological sense, not in the way they're typically thrown

3:15:38.080 --> 3:15:39.240
 around nowadays.

3:15:39.240 --> 3:15:47.040
 So in some cultures, men and women will only touch for two weeks out of the month.

3:15:47.040 --> 3:15:53.160
 And then for the other two weeks, the excitement and the sensuality and all, and the sexuality

3:15:53.160 --> 3:15:54.800
 is very heightened.

3:15:54.800 --> 3:15:56.320
 And then they go back to this kind of distancing.

3:15:56.320 --> 3:16:00.320
 Now, I don't think that's feasible for most people, but if you look statistically, those

3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:06.040
 relationships tend to last a very long time with at least reported mutual feelings of

3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:10.680
 intense attraction for many, many, many decades.

3:16:10.680 --> 3:16:16.240
 So human beings need to learn how to at least understand and control these dynamics.

3:16:16.240 --> 3:16:17.240
 There's a lot of divorce.

3:16:17.240 --> 3:16:18.240
 There's a lot of cheating.

3:16:18.240 --> 3:16:19.240
 There's a lot of stuff out there.

3:16:19.240 --> 3:16:22.160
 It'd be great if people could resolve some of this stuff inside of the relationship,

3:16:22.160 --> 3:16:23.160
 in my opinion.

3:16:23.160 --> 3:16:35.080
 Yeah, and this kind of intense attraction, there's actually one of the poems, Carl Deisarath

3:16:35.080 --> 3:16:40.840
 introduced me to, I think it's two English poems is the name, but one of the things

3:16:40.840 --> 3:16:48.800
 I find myself for prolonged periods being attracted to is like, you notice some kind

3:16:48.800 --> 3:16:56.320
 of magic and you keep wanting to dig to the depths of that magic.

3:16:56.320 --> 3:16:57.880
 You need to really know that person.

3:16:57.880 --> 3:17:00.520
 To really know a person deeply, yeah.

3:17:00.520 --> 3:17:02.760
 You notice something early on.

3:17:02.760 --> 3:17:03.760
 Sure.

3:17:03.760 --> 3:17:07.600
 I don't know what that is, but you just notice something special and you want to keep pulling

3:17:07.600 --> 3:17:10.360
 at that thread and you never really do.

3:17:10.360 --> 3:17:12.040
 Well, you also have to be careful.

3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:13.440
 I get a lot of questions from God.

3:17:13.440 --> 3:17:16.480
 You have to be careful the questions you ask in a relationship too.

3:17:16.480 --> 3:17:18.520
 You have to make sure you really want that information.

3:17:18.520 --> 3:17:20.160
 It's not just about people's past.

3:17:20.160 --> 3:17:25.080
 If you ask somebody how they really feel about something about you and they tell you, that

3:17:25.080 --> 3:17:26.080
 may be soothing.

3:17:26.080 --> 3:17:29.680
 It may be intensely stressful.

3:17:29.680 --> 3:17:31.400
 Here's one thing I know for sure.

3:17:31.400 --> 3:17:35.000
 For a relationship to work, you have to be brave.

3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:39.560
 You can't go in there fully protected and yet you also can't go in there with no boundaries

3:17:39.560 --> 3:17:42.400
 because you'll end up beat up.

3:17:42.400 --> 3:17:43.400
 What's that quote?

3:17:43.400 --> 3:17:46.600
 If you want to be a warrior prepared to get hurt, if you want to be an explorer prepared

3:17:46.600 --> 3:17:52.880
 to get lost and if you want to become a lover prepared to beat both or something like that.

3:17:52.880 --> 3:17:53.880
 I forget.

3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:56.480
 This is one of these Instagram type things that you see passing by and you go, oh, that's

3:17:56.480 --> 3:17:57.480
 pretty true.

3:17:57.480 --> 3:18:02.920
 Love is scary because it takes us back to that primitive circuitry that is as primitive

3:18:02.920 --> 3:18:07.120
 and basic as hunger, thirst, the desire for heat when we're cold, the desire for cold

3:18:07.120 --> 3:18:12.200
 when we're overly warm, it's dinorphin.

3:18:12.200 --> 3:18:19.880
 When somebody you were attached to, leaves by death or by decision or you're forced

3:18:19.880 --> 3:18:22.600
 apart, the dinorphin release is massive.

3:18:22.600 --> 3:18:24.760
 It is true discomfort.

3:18:24.760 --> 3:18:30.440
 People feel anxiety and discomfort and moving through that is the hell of a process.

3:18:30.440 --> 3:18:35.560
 If I knew how to best break up at the neurological level or if you could just plug yourself into

3:18:35.560 --> 3:18:41.560
 a wall and reset, I'd do that episode tomorrow but we don't have that knowledge.

3:18:41.560 --> 3:18:42.560
 Come on.

3:18:42.560 --> 3:18:45.800
 I think we've covered this before and it's even been mummified.

3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:49.560
 I think losing love is part of the magic of love.

3:18:49.560 --> 3:18:51.440
 It means you've felt something.

3:18:51.440 --> 3:18:56.120
 I agree but at some point, have you done it enough times?

3:18:56.120 --> 3:18:57.520
 Life is finite.

3:18:57.520 --> 3:19:05.560
 It is beautiful to see these couples that seem very much in love despite having been

3:19:05.560 --> 3:19:06.560
 together many years.

3:19:06.560 --> 3:19:07.560
 Yeah.

3:19:07.560 --> 3:19:10.560
 The way they look at each other, they still see the magic.

3:19:10.560 --> 3:19:14.080
 And they'll say, we got lucky or it's been hard or this and that.

3:19:14.080 --> 3:19:20.760
 I think external conditions being a little tougher is helpful for a couple.

3:19:20.760 --> 3:19:21.760
 Hardship.

3:19:21.760 --> 3:19:28.240
 I do because I think that you rally and you bond with people, obviously you want to survive

3:19:28.240 --> 3:19:31.800
 those conditions but yeah, I do.

3:19:31.800 --> 3:19:33.800
 Bonnie and Clyde.

3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:37.120
 Well, they were a little too much.

3:19:37.120 --> 3:19:39.880
 They were sociopaths.

3:19:39.880 --> 3:19:44.480
 But when two sociopaths find one, love can make you do crazy things.

3:19:44.480 --> 3:19:45.480
 Normally it's interesting.

3:19:45.480 --> 3:19:50.720
 Normally sociopaths don't team up because they manipulate each other.

3:19:50.720 --> 3:19:58.760
 Sociopaths sadly are usually only interested in manipulating the highly pliable or unsuspecting.

3:19:58.760 --> 3:20:05.600
 But when romantic attraction is woven in, then it gets really diabolical.

3:20:05.600 --> 3:20:09.520
 Any advice on finding the love of your life, of my life?

3:20:09.520 --> 3:20:12.760
 This is why Alexa's single response.

3:20:12.760 --> 3:20:13.760
 Any advice?

3:20:13.760 --> 3:20:14.760
 Yeah.

3:20:14.760 --> 3:20:20.200
 Actually, this comes from a friend of mine who is in a really excellent marriage with

3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:24.680
 great kids and family and high demand life.

3:20:24.680 --> 3:20:25.680
 It's a decision.

3:20:25.680 --> 3:20:32.440
 Like at some point you just prioritize it as, okay, I'm going to make this happen one

3:20:32.440 --> 3:20:33.680
 way or another.

3:20:33.680 --> 3:20:36.680
 And you don't force the discovery of that person.

3:20:36.680 --> 3:20:41.280
 I mean, I've occasionally said, hey, I think you should meet this person or that person.

3:20:41.280 --> 3:20:46.360
 And well, it wasn't maybe my judgment might have been off, but the timing wasn't right

3:20:46.360 --> 3:20:47.360
 or something.

3:20:47.360 --> 3:20:50.040
 But I think that, yeah, it's a decision.

3:20:50.040 --> 3:20:51.640
 And it also has to do with life structure.

3:20:51.640 --> 3:20:53.040
 I mean, there were years.

3:20:53.040 --> 3:20:56.320
 So when I was in graduate school, I didn't want a girlfriend.

3:20:56.320 --> 3:20:57.640
 I just wanted to be in lab.

3:20:57.640 --> 3:21:01.880
 And I sure I had romantic dating interests, but I wasn't going to meet them through a

3:21:01.880 --> 3:21:04.040
 committed live together situation.

3:21:04.040 --> 3:21:05.400
 It wasn't where I was at.

3:21:05.400 --> 3:21:08.320
 And as a postdoc, things were a little different, et cetera, et cetera.

3:21:08.320 --> 3:21:12.600
 But at some point, it's sort of like, what do I want my daily routine to look like?

3:21:12.600 --> 3:21:16.800
 Because ultimately a relationship, however one structures is going to be part of your

3:21:16.800 --> 3:21:18.200
 daily routine.

3:21:18.200 --> 3:21:22.520
 So at the point where you're like, I'd really love to wake up next to somebody and do blank

3:21:22.520 --> 3:21:24.080
 and blank together.

3:21:24.080 --> 3:21:27.640
 And then I'd love to work and then we meet for dinner.

3:21:27.640 --> 3:21:31.760
 And then we take the dog for a walk or take kids out or whatever it happens to be, take

3:21:31.760 --> 3:21:32.760
 a trip.

3:21:32.760 --> 3:21:38.760
 You have to be, one has to be in the mindset of wanting to do couple like things, people.

3:21:38.760 --> 3:21:41.000
 And a lot of people don't think about it that way.

3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:48.400
 They either fall into something or they don't see the benefits of coupling up.

3:21:48.400 --> 3:21:55.000
 I think that the pandemic tuned people's awareness to the fact that some things are

3:21:55.000 --> 3:21:59.880
 indeed easier on your own, depends on finances, et cetera, et cetera.

3:21:59.880 --> 3:22:05.320
 But a lot of things are made better, done with other people.

3:22:05.320 --> 3:22:13.560
 100%, but I also, so I was very deliberately, it's an interesting way to put it, but what

3:22:13.560 --> 3:22:15.360
 do you want your day to look like?

3:22:15.360 --> 3:22:17.280
 I think what do you want your day to look like?

3:22:17.280 --> 3:22:18.680
 What do you want your life to be?

3:22:18.680 --> 3:22:27.160
 I was very deliberately always, first of all, happy to be alone, like a conscious thinking.

3:22:27.160 --> 3:22:31.080
 I know a lot of friends who are just unable to be alone.

3:22:31.080 --> 3:22:35.880
 I'm able to be alone, but I'm much happier with another person.

3:22:35.880 --> 3:22:39.560
 Like I'm able to share joy with other humans.

3:22:39.560 --> 3:22:46.320
 I look forward to the day that our kids are rolling Jiu Jitsu and my kids are hanging out

3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:47.320
 with your kids.

3:22:47.320 --> 3:22:55.640
 And if that notion sounds even remotely interesting and fun, then it's sort of like you kind of

3:22:55.640 --> 3:22:58.360
 backpedal from that and you go, well, it has to happen.

3:22:58.360 --> 3:23:06.240
 First engineer and think from first principles about love, Andrew, you're, thank you for

3:23:06.240 --> 3:23:07.240
 being my friend.

3:23:07.240 --> 3:23:11.640
 Thank you for being an amazing human being who's so inspiring to so many people for constantly.

3:23:11.640 --> 3:23:21.880
 I told us the car, like one of the things that was really refreshing about you is that

3:23:21.880 --> 3:23:27.680
 when I tell you an idea and I tell you a thought, when I tell you something, you don't shut

3:23:27.680 --> 3:23:29.080
 it down as a first step.

3:23:29.080 --> 3:23:32.680
 I was saying that that's common in the scientific community, that's common in people around

3:23:32.680 --> 3:23:33.680
 you.

3:23:33.680 --> 3:23:34.680
 You're seeing what's the goal there.

3:23:34.680 --> 3:23:35.680
 You get excited.

3:23:35.680 --> 3:23:37.200
 You get excited together.

3:23:37.200 --> 3:23:43.560
 And that's how you can really have a great friendship and a great stuff together.

3:23:43.560 --> 3:23:50.280
 So I'm deeply grateful for that and just for connecting so many interesting people together.

3:23:50.280 --> 3:23:52.920
 You're doing an amazing job, man.

3:23:52.920 --> 3:23:54.240
 Thank you for existing.

3:23:54.240 --> 3:23:55.240
 Thank you for being you.

3:23:55.240 --> 3:23:56.440
 Thank you for talking today.

3:23:56.440 --> 3:23:58.400
 And next time, I'll see you in the sauna.

3:23:58.400 --> 3:23:59.400
 Yeah, yeah.

3:23:59.400 --> 3:24:00.400
 Nice, Beth.

3:24:00.400 --> 3:24:01.400
 Well, I want to say several things.

3:24:01.400 --> 3:24:03.200
 First of all, thank you for having me on again.

3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:04.560
 It's an honor and a pleasure.

3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:05.560
 I don't say that formally.

3:24:05.560 --> 3:24:08.160
 I'd really, truly mean it.

3:24:08.160 --> 3:24:12.600
 The Huberman Lab podcast, as I always say, only exists because you gave me the suggestion

3:24:12.600 --> 3:24:15.000
 and I'm so grateful that you did.

3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:16.320
 So thank you.

3:24:16.320 --> 3:24:21.760
 And for doing what you do, you are brave and you're a first man in and you're just continue

3:24:21.760 --> 3:24:22.760
 to do it just whatever.

3:24:22.760 --> 3:24:27.560
 As my postdoc advisor used to say, whatever you're doing, just keep going.

3:24:27.560 --> 3:24:33.280
 And then in terms of our friendship, I think you know and if you don't, I'm going to just

3:24:33.280 --> 3:24:37.360
 keep telling you anyway by text and in person, you're an amazing friend.

3:24:37.360 --> 3:24:38.360
 There's deep trust.

3:24:38.360 --> 3:24:40.840
 There's immense respect.

3:24:40.840 --> 3:24:42.840
 And I love you, brother.

3:24:42.840 --> 3:24:44.520
 I love you too, man.

3:24:44.520 --> 3:24:45.520
 We did it.

 And now let me leave you with some words from Ralph Waldo Emerson.

3:24:57.080 --> 3:25:02.440
 It is one of the blessings of old friends that you can afford to be stupid with them.

3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:08.280
 I look forward to doing just that in the many years to come of friendship and fun conversations

3:25:08.280 --> 3:25:09.280
 with Andrew.

3:25:09.280 --> 3:25:15.840
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
