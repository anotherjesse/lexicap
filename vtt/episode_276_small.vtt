00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
 Remember George Washington, you know how he died?

00:02.200 --> 00:04.680
 Well, meaning physicians bled him to death.

00:04.680 --> 00:08.340
 And this was the most important patient in the country,

00:08.340 --> 00:10.480
 maybe in the history of the country,

00:10.480 --> 00:13.660
 and we bled him to death, trying to help him.

00:13.660 --> 00:17.200
 So when you're actually inflating the money supply

00:17.200 --> 00:20.240
 at 7%, but you're calling it 2%

00:20.240 --> 00:22.840
 because you wanna help the economy,

00:22.840 --> 00:27.840
 you're literally bleeding the free market to death.

00:27.840 --> 00:31.400
 But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it

00:31.400 --> 00:33.920
 because he thought that they were gonna do him good.

00:33.920 --> 00:38.920
 And the majority of the society, most companies,

00:39.440 --> 00:44.440
 most conventional thinkers, you know, the working class,

00:44.480 --> 00:47.120
 they go along with this because they think

00:47.120 --> 00:49.820
 that someone has their best interest in mind.

00:49.820 --> 00:53.740
 And the people that are bleeding them to death believe,

00:53.740 --> 00:55.480
 they believe that prescription

00:55.480 --> 00:58.240
 because their mental models are just so defective.

01:00.440 --> 01:03.000
 The following is a conversation with Michael Saylor,

01:03.000 --> 01:04.960
 one of the most prominent and brilliant

01:04.960 --> 01:06.840
 Bitcoin proponents in the world.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.760
 He is the CEO of MicroStrategy,

01:09.760 --> 01:13.880
 founder of Saylor Academy, graduate of MIT,

01:13.880 --> 01:16.440
 and Michael is one of the most fascinating

01:16.440 --> 01:18.640
 and rigorous thinkers I've ever gotten a chance

01:18.640 --> 01:20.220
 to explore ideas with.

01:20.220 --> 01:23.240
 He can effortlessly zoom out to the big perspectives

01:23.240 --> 01:25.520
 of human civilization and human history

01:25.520 --> 01:29.720
 and zoom back in to the technical details of blockchains,

01:29.720 --> 01:33.120
 markets, governments, and financial systems.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.120
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.320
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:37.320 --> 01:38.360
 in the description.

01:38.360 --> 01:42.440
 And now, dear friends, here's Michael Saylor.

01:43.440 --> 01:48.200
 Let's start with a big question of truth and wisdom.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.720
 When advanced humans or aliens or AI systems,

01:50.720 --> 01:53.280
 let's say five to 10 centuries from now,

01:53.280 --> 01:58.240
 look back at Earth on this early 21st century,

01:58.240 --> 02:01.120
 how much do you think they would say we understood

02:01.120 --> 02:04.960
 about money and economics, or even about engineering,

02:04.960 --> 02:07.240
 science, life, death, meaning, intelligence,

02:07.240 --> 02:09.900
 consciousness, all the big interesting questions?

02:12.240 --> 02:17.240
 I think they would probably give us a B minus on engineering,

02:17.240 --> 02:22.240
 on all the engineering things, the hard sciences.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.760
 A passing grade.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.240
 Like we're doing okay.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.680
 We're working our way through rockets and jets

02:28.680 --> 02:32.880
 and electric cars and electricity transport systems

02:32.880 --> 02:37.280
 and nuclear power and space flight and the like.

02:37.280 --> 02:42.280
 And if you look at the walls that grace the great court

02:43.800 --> 02:46.640
 at MIT, it's full of all the great thinkers

02:46.640 --> 02:48.880
 and they're all pretty admirable.

02:48.880 --> 02:52.320
 You know, if you could be with Newton or Gauss

02:52.320 --> 02:57.320
 or Madame Curie or Einstein, you know, you would respect them.

02:59.400 --> 03:04.400
 I would say they'd give us like a D minus on economics.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.000
 Like, you know, an F plus or a D minus.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.720
 You see, I have an optimistic vision.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.120
 First of all, optimistic vision of engineering,

03:12.120 --> 03:15.240
 because everybody you've listed, not everybody,

03:15.240 --> 03:16.920
 but most people you've listed is just

03:16.920 --> 03:19.280
 over the past couple of centuries.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.240
 And maybe stretches a little farther back,

03:21.240 --> 03:24.400
 but mostly all the cool stuff we've done in engineering

03:24.400 --> 03:26.440
 is the past couple of centuries.

03:26.440 --> 03:30.200
 I mean, Archimedes, you know, had his virtues.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.720
 You know, I studied the history of science at MIT

03:33.720 --> 03:35.960
 and I also studied aerospace engineering.

03:35.960 --> 03:39.840
 And so I clearly have a bias in favor of science.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.520
 And if I look at the past 10,000 years

03:42.520 --> 03:47.120
 and I consider all of the philosophy and the politics

03:47.120 --> 03:49.880
 and their impact on the human condition,

03:49.880 --> 03:51.920
 I think it's a wash for every politician

03:51.920 --> 03:53.560
 that came up with a good idea.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.960
 Another politician came up with a bad idea, right?

03:56.960 --> 03:59.400
 And it's not clear to me that, you know,

03:59.400 --> 04:03.120
 most of the political and philosophical, you know,

04:03.120 --> 04:07.040
 contributions to the human race and the human conditions

04:07.040 --> 04:08.400
 have advanced so much.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.680
 I mean, we're still taking, you know,

04:10.680 --> 04:14.640
 taking guidance and admiring, Aristotle and Plato

04:14.640 --> 04:17.280
 and Seneca and the like.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.760
 And on the other hand, you know,

04:19.760 --> 04:23.800
 if you think about what has made the human condition better,

04:25.360 --> 04:30.360
 fire, water, harnessing of wind energy,

04:30.840 --> 04:33.560
 try to row across an ocean, right?

04:33.560 --> 04:34.800
 Not easy.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.600
 And for people who are just listening or watching,

04:37.600 --> 04:42.160
 there's a beautiful sexy ship from 16th, 17th century.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.400
 This is a 19th century handmade model

04:44.400 --> 04:47.560
 of a 17th century sailing ship,

04:47.560 --> 04:51.160
 which is of the type that the Dutch East India's company

04:51.160 --> 04:54.120
 used to sail the world and trade.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.160
 So that was made, you know,

04:56.160 --> 04:59.560
 the original is made sometime in the 1600s

04:59.560 --> 05:03.480
 and then this model is made in the 19th century

05:03.480 --> 05:04.560
 by individuals.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.280
 Both the model and the ship itself

05:06.280 --> 05:08.440
 is engineering at its best and just imagine,

05:08.440 --> 05:10.160
 just like rock is flying out to space,

05:10.160 --> 05:12.120
 how much hope this filled people with,

05:12.120 --> 05:15.200
 exploring the unknown, going into the mystery.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.720
 Both the entrepreneurs and the business people

05:19.720 --> 05:23.120
 and the engineers and just humans, what's out there?

05:23.120 --> 05:24.520
 What's out there to be discovered?

05:24.520 --> 05:27.760
 Yeah, the metaphor of human beings leaving shore

05:27.760 --> 05:29.600
 sailing across the horizon,

05:29.600 --> 05:32.080
 risking their lives in pursuit of a better life

05:32.080 --> 05:33.820
 is an incredibly powerful one.

05:33.820 --> 05:38.820
 In 1900, I suppose the average life expectancy is 50.

05:41.820 --> 05:43.740
 During the Revolutionary War,

05:43.740 --> 05:46.020
 you know, while our founding fathers were fighting

05:46.020 --> 05:48.820
 to establish, you know, life, liberty,

05:48.820 --> 05:51.200
 pursuit of happiness, the constitution,

05:51.200 --> 05:54.700
 average life expectancy of it's like 32,

05:54.700 --> 05:56.900
 some between 32 and 36.

05:56.900 --> 06:01.300
 So all the sound in the fury doesn't make you live past 32,

06:01.300 --> 06:04.340
 but what does, right, antibiotics?

06:04.340 --> 06:06.620
 Conquest of infectious diseases,

06:06.620 --> 06:10.460
 if we understand the science of infectious disease,

06:10.460 --> 06:15.460
 you know, sterilizing a knife and harnessing antibiotics

06:16.020 --> 06:18.880
 gets you from 50 to 70 and that happened fast, right?

06:18.880 --> 06:23.560
 That happens from 1900 to 1950 or something like that.

06:24.440 --> 06:28.140
 And I think if you look at the human condition,

06:28.140 --> 06:31.620
 you ever get on one of those rowing machines

06:31.620 --> 06:34.180
 where they actually keep track of your watts output

06:34.180 --> 06:37.820
 when you're on the, it's like 200 is a lot.

06:38.660 --> 06:41.100
 Okay, 200 is a lot.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.820
 So a kilowatt hour is like all the energy

06:44.820 --> 06:49.820
 that a human trained athlete can deliver in a day.

06:50.220 --> 06:53.940
 And probably not 1% of the people in the world

06:53.940 --> 06:56.220
 could deliver a kilowatt hour in a day

06:56.220 --> 06:59.060
 and the commercial value of a kilowatt hour,

06:59.060 --> 07:02.020
 the retail value is 11 cents today.

07:02.020 --> 07:05.580
 And the wholesale value is two cents.

07:05.580 --> 07:10.180
 And so you have to look at the contribution

07:10.180 --> 07:13.580
 of politicians and philosophers and economists

07:13.580 --> 07:15.300
 to the human condition.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.060
 And it's like at best to wash one way or the other.

07:19.060 --> 07:22.940
 And then if you look at the contribution of John D. Rockefeller

07:22.940 --> 07:25.660
 when he delivered you a barrel of oil,

07:25.660 --> 07:29.420
 and the energy in oil, liquid energy

07:29.420 --> 07:34.420
 or the contribution of Tesla as we deliver electricity.

07:36.260 --> 07:38.420
 And what's the impact on the human condition

07:38.420 --> 07:43.420
 if I have electric power, if I have chemical power,

07:43.420 --> 07:45.340
 if I have wind energy,

07:45.340 --> 07:47.940
 if I can actually set up a reservoir,

07:47.940 --> 07:51.260
 create a dam, spend a turbine

07:51.260 --> 07:55.780
 and generate energy from a hydraulic source,

07:55.780 --> 07:58.060
 that's extraordinary, right?

07:58.060 --> 08:02.380
 And so our ability to cross the ocean,

08:02.380 --> 08:05.980
 our ability to grow food, our ability to live,

08:05.980 --> 08:10.020
 it's technology that gets the human race from,

08:10.020 --> 08:15.020
 you know, a brutal life where life expectancy is 30

08:15.020 --> 08:18.340
 to a world where life expectancy is 80.

08:18.340 --> 08:20.620
 You gave a D minus to the economists.

08:20.620 --> 08:23.340
 So are they too like the politicians to wash

08:23.340 --> 08:25.980
 in terms of there's good ideas and bad ideas

08:25.980 --> 08:30.180
 and that tiny delta between good and bad

08:30.180 --> 08:32.820
 is how you squeak past the F plus

08:32.820 --> 08:34.940
 onto the D minus territory?

08:34.940 --> 08:38.100
 I think most economic ideas are bad ideas.

08:38.100 --> 08:43.100
 Like, you know, like take us back to MIT

08:43.100 --> 08:46.100
 and you want to solve a fluid dynamics problem.

08:46.100 --> 08:49.900
 Like design the shape of the hull of that ship

08:49.900 --> 08:52.980
 or you want to design an airfoil, a wing,

08:52.980 --> 08:56.260
 or if you want to design an engine

08:56.260 --> 09:00.340
 or a nozzle in a rocket ship,

09:00.340 --> 09:03.340
 you wouldn't do it with simple arithmetic.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.740
 You wouldn't do it with a scalar.

09:04.740 --> 09:06.380
 There's not a single number, right?

09:06.380 --> 09:10.180
 It's vector math, you know, computational fluid dynamics

09:10.180 --> 09:14.700
 is indimensional, higher level math, you know?

09:14.700 --> 09:16.260
 Complicated stuff.

09:16.260 --> 09:20.460
 So when an economist says the inflation rate is 2%,

09:20.460 --> 09:21.580
 that's a scalar.

09:21.580 --> 09:23.980
 And when an economist says,

09:23.980 --> 09:26.500
 it's not a problem to print more money

09:26.500 --> 09:29.580
 because the velocity of the money is very low,

09:29.580 --> 09:31.180
 monetary velocity is low.

09:31.180 --> 09:33.100
 That's another scalar.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.500
 Okay, so the truth of the matter is

09:37.500 --> 09:39.180
 inflation is not a scalar.

09:39.180 --> 09:42.140
 Inflation is an indimensional vector.

09:42.140 --> 09:45.420
 Money velocity is not a scalar.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.340
 Saying what's the velocity of money?

09:50.340 --> 09:52.740
 Oh, it's slow or it's fast.

09:52.740 --> 09:55.340
 It ignores the question of

09:55.340 --> 09:58.140
 what medium is the money moving through?

09:58.140 --> 10:00.460
 And the same way that, you know,

10:00.460 --> 10:02.820
 what's the speed of sound?

10:02.820 --> 10:05.140
 Okay, well, what is sound, right?

10:05.140 --> 10:09.260
 Sound, you know, sound is a compression wave.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.540
 It's energy moving through a medium,

10:12.540 --> 10:14.140
 but the speed is different.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.500
 So for example, the speed of sound through air

10:16.500 --> 10:19.100
 is different than the speed of sound through water.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.460
 And sound moves faster through water.

10:21.460 --> 10:22.820
 It moves faster through a solid

10:22.820 --> 10:25.380
 and it moves faster through a stiffer solid.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.260
 So there isn't one.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.740
 What is the fundamental problem

10:28.740 --> 10:32.220
 with the way economists reduce the world down to a model?

10:32.220 --> 10:33.860
 Is it too simple?

10:33.860 --> 10:35.940
 Or is it just even the first principles

10:35.940 --> 10:37.900
 of constructing the model is wrong?

10:37.900 --> 10:41.900
 I think that the fundamental problem is

10:41.900 --> 10:43.820
 if you see the world as a scalar,

10:43.820 --> 10:46.980
 you simply pick the one number

10:46.980 --> 10:50.580
 which supports whatever you wanna do

10:50.580 --> 10:55.580
 and you ignore the universe of other consequences

10:55.700 --> 10:57.220
 from your behavior.

10:57.220 --> 10:59.060
 In general, I don't know if you've heard

10:59.060 --> 11:02.380
 of like Eric Watson has been talking about this

11:02.380 --> 11:03.220
 with gauge theory.

11:03.220 --> 11:06.660
 So different kinds of approaches from the physics world,

11:06.660 --> 11:09.380
 from the mathematical world to extend

11:09.380 --> 11:13.260
 past this scalar view of economics.

11:13.260 --> 11:16.100
 So gauge theory is one way that comes from physics.

11:16.100 --> 11:20.820
 Do you find that a way of exploring economics interesting?

11:20.820 --> 11:22.700
 So outside of cryptocurrency,

11:22.700 --> 11:24.380
 outside of the extra technologies and so on,

11:24.380 --> 11:27.420
 just analysis of how economics works.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.860
 Do you find that interesting?

11:30.660 --> 11:33.260
 Yeah, I think that if we're gonna wanna

11:33.260 --> 11:36.020
 really make any scientific progress in economics,

11:36.020 --> 11:40.740
 we have to apply much more computationally intensive

11:40.740 --> 11:43.180
 and richer forms of mathematics.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.300
 So simulation perhaps or?

11:45.300 --> 11:47.100
 Yeah, you know, when I was in MIT,

11:47.100 --> 11:49.780
 I studied system dynamics, you know,

11:49.780 --> 11:51.100
 they taught it out of the Sloan School.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.660
 It was developed by Jay Forrester

11:53.660 --> 11:58.660
 who was an extraordinary computer scientist.

11:59.300 --> 12:04.300
 And when we've created models of economic behavior,

12:04.300 --> 12:07.940
 they were all multidimensional nonlinear models.

12:07.940 --> 12:11.540
 So if you wanna describe how anything works

12:11.540 --> 12:12.620
 in the real world,

12:12.620 --> 12:15.140
 you have to start with the concept of feedback.

12:15.140 --> 12:17.780
 If I double the price of something,

12:17.780 --> 12:22.780
 demand will fall and attempts to create supply will increase.

12:22.940 --> 12:27.620
 And there will be a delay before the capacity increases.

12:27.620 --> 12:29.980
 There'll be an instant demand change

12:29.980 --> 12:31.700
 and there'll be rippling effects

12:31.700 --> 12:33.980
 throughout every other segment of the economy.

12:33.980 --> 12:36.780
 Downstream and upstream of such thing.

12:36.780 --> 12:39.020
 So it's kind of common sense,

12:39.020 --> 12:41.460
 but most economics, most classical economics,

12:41.460 --> 12:45.700
 it's always, you know, taught with linear models,

12:45.700 --> 12:48.300
 you know, fairly simplistic linear models.

12:48.300 --> 12:52.300
 And oftentimes even, I'm really shocked today

12:52.300 --> 12:56.380
 that the entire mainstream dialogue of economics

12:56.380 --> 13:00.300
 has been captured by scale or arithmetic.

13:00.300 --> 13:04.500
 For example, if you read, you know,

13:04.500 --> 13:06.340
 read any article in the New York Times

13:06.340 --> 13:07.700
 or the Wall Street Journal, right?

13:07.700 --> 13:09.980
 They just refer to, there's an inflation number

13:09.980 --> 13:14.380
 or the CPI or the inflation rate is X.

13:14.380 --> 13:17.340
 And if you look at all the historic studies

13:17.340 --> 13:19.580
 of the impact of inflation,

13:19.580 --> 13:23.940
 generally they're all based upon the idea

13:23.940 --> 13:26.220
 that inflation equals CPI

13:26.220 --> 13:28.420
 and then they try to extrapolate from that

13:28.420 --> 13:31.340
 and then you just get nowhere with it.

13:32.300 --> 13:35.820
 So at the very least, we should be considering inflation

13:35.820 --> 13:39.820
 and other economics concept as a nonlinear dynamical system.

13:39.820 --> 13:44.060
 So nonlinearity and also just embracing the full complexity

13:44.060 --> 13:45.620
 of just how the variables interact,

13:45.620 --> 13:47.180
 maybe through simulation,

13:47.180 --> 13:50.220
 maybe some have some interesting models around that.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.500
 Wouldn't it be refreshing if somebody for once

13:52.500 --> 13:55.340
 published a table of the change in price

13:55.340 --> 13:58.460
 of every product, every service and every asset

13:58.460 --> 14:01.380
 and every place over time?

14:01.380 --> 14:02.300
 You said table.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.060
 Some of that also is the task of visualization,

14:05.060 --> 14:09.780
 how to extract from this complex set of numbers patterns

14:09.780 --> 14:14.020
 that somehow indicate something fundamental

14:14.020 --> 14:15.220
 about what's happening.

14:15.220 --> 14:18.820
 So like summarization of data is still important.

14:18.820 --> 14:22.220
 Perhaps summarization not down to a single scale of value,

14:22.220 --> 14:25.420
 but looking at that whole sea of numbers,

14:25.420 --> 14:30.020
 you have to find patterns.

14:30.020 --> 14:32.380
 Like what is inflation in a particular sector?

14:32.380 --> 14:34.940
 What is it maybe a change over time?

14:34.940 --> 14:37.380
 Maybe different geographical regions,

14:37.380 --> 14:39.180
 things of that nature.

14:39.180 --> 14:40.580
 I think that's kind of,

14:40.580 --> 14:43.020
 I don't know even what that task is.

14:43.020 --> 14:44.940
 That's what you could look at machine learning.

14:44.940 --> 14:47.260
 You can look at AI with that perspective,

14:47.260 --> 14:50.060
 which is like how do you represent

14:50.060 --> 14:54.060
 what's happening efficiently as efficiently as possible?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.700
 That's never going to be a single number,

14:55.700 --> 14:57.220
 but it might be a compressed model

14:57.220 --> 14:59.580
 that captures something beautiful,

14:59.580 --> 15:02.060
 something fundamental about what's happening.

15:02.060 --> 15:05.340
 It's an opportunity for sure, right?

15:08.900 --> 15:13.220
 If we take, for example, during the pandemic,

15:13.220 --> 15:16.700
 the response of the political apparatus

15:16.700 --> 15:20.180
 was to lower interest rates to zero

15:20.180 --> 15:24.700
 and to start buying assets, in essence, printing money.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.140
 And the defense was there's no inflation.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.980
 But of course, you had one part of the economy

15:31.980 --> 15:33.500
 where it was locked down,

15:33.500 --> 15:36.660
 so it was illegal to buy anything.

15:36.660 --> 15:39.220
 But you couldn't, you know, it was either illegal

15:39.220 --> 15:41.380
 or it was impractical.

15:41.380 --> 15:44.260
 So it would be impossible for demand to manifest.

15:44.260 --> 15:46.140
 So of course, there is no inflation.

15:46.140 --> 15:47.860
 On the other hand,

15:47.860 --> 15:51.580
 there was instantaneous immediate inflation

15:51.580 --> 15:53.580
 in another part of the economy.

15:53.580 --> 15:58.220
 For example, you lower the interest rates to zero.

15:58.220 --> 16:01.460
 At one point we saw the swap rate on a 30 year note

16:01.460 --> 16:03.460
 go to 72 basis points.

16:04.420 --> 16:06.700
 Okay, that means that the value

16:06.700 --> 16:09.540
 of a long dated bond immediately inflates.

16:09.540 --> 16:12.060
 So the bond market had hyperinflation

16:12.060 --> 16:17.060
 within minutes of these financial decisions.

16:17.660 --> 16:20.460
 The asset market had hyperinflation.

16:20.460 --> 16:23.340
 We had what you call a K shape recovery,

16:23.340 --> 16:26.140
 what we affectionately call a K shape recovery.

16:26.140 --> 16:27.660
 Main street shut down,

16:27.660 --> 16:30.980
 Wall Street recovered all within six weeks.

16:30.980 --> 16:33.340
 The inflation was in the assets,

16:33.340 --> 16:35.860
 like in the stocks, in the bonds.

16:37.220 --> 16:38.340
 You know, if you look today,

16:38.340 --> 16:42.020
 you see that a typical house, according to the case,

16:42.020 --> 16:46.700
 Schiller index today is up 19.2% year over year.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.420
 So if you're a first time home buyer,

16:50.420 --> 16:52.420
 the inflation rate is 19%.

16:53.700 --> 16:57.700
 The formal CPI announced a 7.9%.

16:58.940 --> 17:03.380
 You can pretty much create any inflation rate you want

17:03.380 --> 17:05.980
 by constructing a market basket,

17:05.980 --> 17:08.820
 a weighted basket of products or services

17:08.820 --> 17:11.860
 or assets that yield you the answer.

17:11.860 --> 17:13.780
 I think that, you know,

17:13.780 --> 17:16.420
 the fundamental failing of economists is,

17:16.420 --> 17:20.780
 first of all, they don't really have a term

17:20.780 --> 17:24.340
 for asset inflation, right?

17:24.340 --> 17:27.340
 What's an asset, what's asset hyperinflation?

17:27.340 --> 17:29.780
 You mentioned bond market swap rate

17:29.780 --> 17:32.300
 and asset is where the all majority

17:32.300 --> 17:33.780
 of the hyperinflation happened.

17:33.780 --> 17:35.780
 What's inflation?

17:35.780 --> 17:36.820
 What's hyperinflation?

17:36.820 --> 17:39.340
 What's an asset market?

17:39.340 --> 17:40.860
 I'm gonna ask so many dumb questions.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.540
 In the conventional economic world,

17:43.540 --> 17:48.540
 you would treat inflation as the rate of increase in price

17:48.980 --> 17:52.260
 of a market basket of consumer products

17:52.260 --> 17:54.340
 defined by a government agency.

17:56.060 --> 17:58.460
 So they have like traditional things

17:58.460 --> 18:01.180
 that a regular consumer would be buying.

18:01.180 --> 18:05.740
 The government selects like toilet paper, food,

18:05.740 --> 18:09.060
 toaster, refrigerator, electronics,

18:09.060 --> 18:09.900
 all that kind of stuff.

18:09.900 --> 18:14.540
 And it's like a representative basket of goods

18:14.540 --> 18:18.220
 that lead to a content existence on this earth

18:18.220 --> 18:19.780
 for a regular consumer.

18:19.780 --> 18:22.700
 They define a synthetic metric, right?

18:22.700 --> 18:25.940
 I mean, I'm gonna say you should have 1,000 square foot

18:25.940 --> 18:29.780
 apartment and you should have a used car

18:29.780 --> 18:33.180
 and you should eat three hamburgers a week.

18:33.180 --> 18:37.460
 Now, 10 years go by and the apartment costs more.

18:37.460 --> 18:40.740
 I could adjust the market basket by a,

18:40.740 --> 18:42.220
 they call them hedonic adjustments.

18:42.220 --> 18:45.140
 I could decide that it used to be a 1970

18:45.140 --> 18:48.660
 to 1,000 square feet, but in the year 2020,

18:48.660 --> 18:50.460
 you only need 700 square feet

18:50.460 --> 18:53.700
 because we've miniaturized televisions

18:53.700 --> 18:56.740
 and we've got more efficient electric appliances

18:56.740 --> 18:58.620
 and because things have collapsed into the iPhone,

18:58.620 --> 19:00.300
 you just don't need as much space.

19:00.300 --> 19:04.780
 So now I, it may be that the apartment costs 50% more,

19:04.780 --> 19:07.460
 but after the hedonic adjustment, there is no inflation

19:07.460 --> 19:10.260
 because I just downgraded the expectation

19:10.260 --> 19:11.860
 of what a normal person should have.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.460
 So the synthetic nature of the metric

19:13.460 --> 19:17.540
 allows for manipulation by people in power?

19:17.540 --> 19:18.380
 Pretty much.

19:19.740 --> 19:24.140
 I guess my criticism of economists is rather than embracing

19:24.140 --> 19:28.260
 inflation based upon its fundamental idea,

19:28.260 --> 19:32.020
 which is the rate at which the price of things go up, right?

19:33.540 --> 19:38.540
 They've been captured by mainstream conventional thinking

19:39.260 --> 19:41.340
 to immediately equate inflation

19:41.340 --> 19:46.020
 to the government issued CPI or government issued PCE

19:46.020 --> 19:48.300
 or government issued PPI measure,

19:48.300 --> 19:51.460
 which was never the rate at which things go up.

19:51.460 --> 19:56.460
 It's simply the rate at which a synthetic basket of products

19:56.460 --> 20:00.220
 and services the government wishes to track go up.

20:00.220 --> 20:04.460
 Now the problem with that is two big things.

20:04.460 --> 20:08.540
 One thing is the government gets to create the market basket

20:08.540 --> 20:13.340
 and so they keep changing what's in the basket over time.

20:13.340 --> 20:16.860
 So I mean, if I keep, if I said three years ago,

20:16.860 --> 20:18.660
 you should go see 10 concerts a year

20:18.660 --> 20:21.620
 and the concert tickets now cost $200 each.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.660
 Now it's $2,000 a year to go see concerts.

20:24.660 --> 20:27.060
 Now I'm in charge of calculating inflation.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.380
 So I redefine, you know, your entertainment quota

20:30.380 --> 20:33.580
 for the year to be eight Netflix streaming concerts

20:33.580 --> 20:35.540
 and now they don't cost $2,000.

20:35.540 --> 20:37.820
 They cost nothing and there is no inflation

20:37.820 --> 20:39.620
 but you don't get your concerts, right?

20:39.620 --> 20:44.380
 So the problem starts with continually changing

20:44.380 --> 20:47.500
 the definition of the market basket.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.780
 But in my opinion, that's not the biggest problem.

20:50.780 --> 20:55.780
 The more egregious problem is the fundamental idea

20:57.380 --> 21:00.380
 that assets aren't products or services.

21:00.380 --> 21:02.620
 Assets can't be inflated.

21:02.620 --> 21:03.820
 What's an asset?

21:03.820 --> 21:06.980
 A house, a share of Apple stock,

21:08.060 --> 21:13.060
 a bond, a Bitcoin is an asset or a Picasso painting.

21:16.460 --> 21:17.500
 So...

21:17.500 --> 21:19.620
 Not a consumable good.

21:19.620 --> 21:23.180
 Not an Apple that you can eat.

21:23.180 --> 21:26.260
 Right, if I throw away an asset,

21:26.260 --> 21:30.260
 then I'm not on the hook to track the inflation rate for it.

21:30.260 --> 21:33.100
 So what happens if I change the policy

21:33.100 --> 21:35.700
 such that, let's take the classic example,

21:35.700 --> 21:38.260
 a million dollar bond at a 5% interest rate

21:38.260 --> 21:41.900
 gives you $50,000 a year in risk free income.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.260
 You might retire on $50,000 a year

21:44.260 --> 21:46.860
 in a low cost jurisdiction.

21:46.860 --> 21:49.820
 So the cost of social security or early retirement

21:49.820 --> 21:52.740
 is $1 million when the interest rate is 5%.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.740
 During the crisis of March of 2020,

21:56.740 --> 21:59.900
 the interest rate on a 10 year bond went to 50 basis points.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.420
 So now the cost of that bond is $10 million.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.300
 Okay, the cost of social security

22:07.300 --> 22:09.740
 went from a million dollars to $10 million.

22:09.740 --> 22:13.340
 So if you wanted to work your entire life, save money

22:13.340 --> 22:16.580
 and then retire risk free and live happily ever after

22:16.580 --> 22:19.740
 on a $50,000 salary, live in on a beach in Mexico

22:19.740 --> 22:23.340
 wherever you want it to go, you had hyperinflation.

22:23.340 --> 22:28.220
 The cost of your aspiration increased by a factor of 10

22:28.220 --> 22:30.660
 over the course of some amount of time.

22:30.660 --> 22:32.380
 In fact, in that case,

22:32.380 --> 22:35.380
 that was over the course of about 12 years, right?

22:35.380 --> 22:39.540
 As the inflation rate ground down, the asset traded up,

22:39.540 --> 22:43.220
 but the conventional view is,

22:43.220 --> 22:44.900
 oh, that's not a problem

22:44.900 --> 22:49.220
 because it's good that the bond is highly priced

22:49.220 --> 22:51.100
 because we own the bond.

22:51.100 --> 22:54.540
 Or what's the problem with the inflation rate

22:54.540 --> 22:56.860
 and housing being 19%?

22:56.860 --> 22:59.860
 It's an awful problem for a 22 year old

22:59.860 --> 23:01.460
 that's starting their first job,

23:01.460 --> 23:03.620
 that's saving money to buy a house,

23:03.620 --> 23:07.660
 but it would be characterized as a benefit to society

23:07.660 --> 23:09.620
 by a conventional economist who would say,

23:09.620 --> 23:12.900
 well, housing asset values are higher

23:12.900 --> 23:14.820
 because of interest rate fluctuation.

23:14.820 --> 23:17.180
 And now the economy's got more wealth.

23:17.180 --> 23:20.900
 And so that's viewed as a benefit.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.100
 So the, what's being missed here,

23:24.100 --> 23:27.220
 like the suffering of the average person

23:27.220 --> 23:31.180
 or the struggle, the suffering,

23:31.180 --> 23:33.340
 the pain of the average person,

23:34.260 --> 23:36.740
 like metrics that captured that within the economic system.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.060
 Is that, is it when you're talking about?

23:38.060 --> 23:42.460
 One way to say it is a conventional view of inflation

23:42.460 --> 23:46.100
 as CPI understates the human misery

23:46.100 --> 23:49.540
 that's inflicted upon the working class

23:49.540 --> 23:54.540
 and on mainstream companies by the political class.

23:57.980 --> 24:00.220
 And so it's a massive shift of wealth

24:00.220 --> 24:03.060
 from the working class to the property class.

24:03.060 --> 24:07.100
 It's a massive shift of power from the free market

24:07.100 --> 24:11.260
 to the centrally governed or the controlled market.

24:11.260 --> 24:12.900
 It's a massive shift of power

24:12.900 --> 24:14.900
 from the people to the government.

24:14.900 --> 24:19.900
 And maybe one more illustrative point here, Alexis,

24:20.980 --> 24:23.500
 is what do you think the inflation rate's been

24:23.500 --> 24:24.700
 for the past 100 years?

24:25.860 --> 24:27.740
 Oh, you're talking about the scaler again?

24:27.740 --> 24:30.660
 If you took a survey of everybody on the street

24:30.660 --> 24:33.340
 and you asked them, what do they think inflation was?

24:33.340 --> 24:35.500
 What is it, you know?

24:35.500 --> 24:37.820
 You remember when Jerome Powell said our target's 2%

24:37.820 --> 24:38.820
 but we're not there.

24:38.820 --> 24:42.460
 If you go around the corner,

24:42.460 --> 24:46.860
 I have posted the deed to this house sold in 1930.

24:48.420 --> 24:53.420
 Okay, and the number on that deed is $100,000, 1930.

24:54.980 --> 24:58.780
 And if you go on Zillow and you get the Z estimate.

24:58.780 --> 25:00.180
 Is it higher than that?

25:00.180 --> 25:02.100
 $30,500,000.

25:02.100 --> 25:02.940
 Yeah.

25:02.940 --> 25:07.940
 So that's 92 years, 1930 or 2022, and in 92 years,

25:12.220 --> 25:17.220
 we've had 305X increase in price of the house.

25:17.220 --> 25:19.380
 Now, if you actually back calculate,

25:19.380 --> 25:22.460
 you come to a conclusion that the inflation rate

25:22.460 --> 25:27.460
 was approximately 6.5% a year every year for 92 years.

25:27.460 --> 25:32.460
 Okay, and there's nobody in government,

25:33.340 --> 25:36.020
 no conventional economists that would ever admit

25:36.020 --> 25:38.580
 to an inflation rate of 7% a year

25:38.580 --> 25:41.540
 in the US dollar over the last century.

25:41.540 --> 25:45.100
 Now, if you dig deeper,

25:45.100 --> 25:48.860
 I mean, one guy that's done a great job working on this

25:48.860 --> 25:52.420
 is Saifidine Amos who wrote the book, The Bitcoin Standard.

25:52.420 --> 25:54.420
 And he notes that on average,

25:54.420 --> 25:57.820
 it looks like the inflation rate and the money supply

25:57.820 --> 26:01.900
 is about 7% a year all the way up to the year 2020.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.900
 If you look at the S&P index,

26:04.900 --> 26:08.140
 which is a market basket of scarce desirable stocks,

26:09.260 --> 26:10.940
 it returned about 10%.

26:12.140 --> 26:14.500
 If you talk to 10% a year for 100 years,

26:15.580 --> 26:19.300
 the money supply is expanding at 7% 100 years.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.500
 If you actually talk to economists

26:21.500 --> 26:24.500
 or you look at the economy and you ask the question,

26:24.500 --> 26:28.220
 how fast does the economy grow in its entirety

26:28.220 --> 26:31.660
 year over year, generally about two to 3%

26:31.660 --> 26:34.820
 like the sum total impact of all this technology

26:34.820 --> 26:37.980
 and human ingenuity might get you a two and a half,

26:37.980 --> 26:39.860
 3% improvement a year.

26:39.860 --> 26:41.260
 As measured by GDP.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.340
 Are you okay with that?

26:44.340 --> 26:45.740
 I'm not sure I go that far yet,

26:45.740 --> 26:49.740
 but I would just say that if you had the human race

26:49.740 --> 26:53.540
 doing stuff, and if you ask the question,

26:53.540 --> 26:56.300
 how much more efficiently will we do the stuff

26:56.300 --> 26:57.500
 next year than this year?

26:57.500 --> 27:01.500
 Or what's the value of all of our innovations

27:01.500 --> 27:05.140
 and inventions and investments in the past 12 months?

27:05.140 --> 27:08.060
 You'd be hard pressed to say we get 2% better.

27:09.500 --> 27:13.620
 Typical investor thinks they're 10% better every year.

27:13.620 --> 27:16.180
 So if you look at what's going on,

27:16.180 --> 27:19.260
 really when you're holding a million dollars of stocks

27:19.260 --> 27:21.220
 and you're getting a 10% gain a year,

27:21.220 --> 27:25.460
 you really get a 7% expansion of the money supply.

27:25.460 --> 27:30.060
 You're getting a two or 3% gain under best circumstances.

27:30.060 --> 27:33.300
 And another way to say that is,

27:33.300 --> 27:36.220
 if the money supply stopped expanding at 7% a year,

27:36.220 --> 27:39.580
 the S&P yield might be 3% and not 10%.

27:39.580 --> 27:40.900
 It probably should be.

27:42.820 --> 27:45.740
 Now that gets you to start to ask a bunch

27:45.740 --> 27:47.180
 of other fundamental questions.

27:47.180 --> 27:51.420
 Like, if I borrow a billion dollars and pay 3% interest

27:51.420 --> 27:54.980
 and the money supply expands at 7% to 10% a year

27:54.980 --> 27:58.900
 and I ended up making a 10% return

27:58.900 --> 28:02.100
 on a billion dollar investment paying 3% interest,

28:02.100 --> 28:03.940
 is that fair?

28:03.940 --> 28:07.380
 And who suffered so that I could do that?

28:07.380 --> 28:11.420
 Because in an environment where you're just inflating

28:11.420 --> 28:15.260
 the money supply and you're holding the assets constant,

28:15.260 --> 28:18.540
 it stands the reason that the price of all the assets

28:18.540 --> 28:21.660
 is going to appreciate somewhat proportional

28:21.660 --> 28:24.180
 to the money supply and the difference

28:24.180 --> 28:26.780
 in asset appreciation is gonna be a function

28:26.780 --> 28:29.660
 of the scarce desirable quality of the assets

28:29.660 --> 28:32.420
 and to what extent can I make more of them

28:32.420 --> 28:37.420
 and to what extent are they truly limited in supply?

28:37.940 --> 28:41.620
 Yeah, so we'll get to a lot of the words you said there.

28:41.620 --> 28:46.620
 The scarer city and so connected to how limited they are

28:47.060 --> 28:49.740
 and the value of those assets.

28:49.740 --> 28:52.980
 But you also said, so the expansion of the money supply

28:52.980 --> 28:56.860
 which is put another way is printing money.

28:56.860 --> 29:00.620
 And so is that always bad, the expansion of the money supply?

29:00.620 --> 29:03.380
 Is this just to put some terms on the table

29:03.380 --> 29:04.580
 so we understand them?

29:06.660 --> 29:09.780
 You nonchalantly say it's always on average,

29:09.780 --> 29:12.100
 expanding every year, the money supply is expanding

29:12.100 --> 29:13.820
 every year by seven percent.

29:13.820 --> 29:17.260
 That's a bad thing, that's a university bad thing.

29:17.260 --> 29:22.260
 It's awful, I guess to be precise, it's the currency.

29:25.900 --> 29:30.420
 I would say money is monetary energy or economic energy.

29:30.420 --> 29:34.140
 And the economic energy has to find its way into a medium.

29:34.140 --> 29:37.340
 So if you wanna move it rapidly as a medium of exchange

29:37.340 --> 29:39.460
 has to find its way into currency.

29:39.460 --> 29:41.980
 But the money can also flow into property

29:41.980 --> 29:44.380
 like a house or gold.

29:44.380 --> 29:46.900
 If the money flows into property,

29:46.900 --> 29:50.060
 it'll probably hold its value much better.

29:50.060 --> 29:52.340
 If the money flows into currency, right?

29:52.340 --> 29:56.140
 If you had put $100,000 in this house,

29:56.140 --> 29:59.780
 you would have 305X return over 92 years.

29:59.780 --> 30:01.980
 But if you had put the money, $100,000

30:01.980 --> 30:05.300
 in a safe deposit box and buried it in the basement,

30:05.300 --> 30:09.780
 you would have lost 99.7% of your wealth

30:09.780 --> 30:11.980
 over the same time period.

30:11.980 --> 30:16.060
 So the expansion of the currency

30:17.860 --> 30:20.180
 creates a massive inefficiency in the society.

30:20.180 --> 30:22.580
 What I'll call an adiabatic lapse.

30:22.580 --> 30:25.660
 It's what we're doing is we're bleeding

30:26.700 --> 30:29.020
 the civilization to death, right?

30:29.020 --> 30:31.940
 What's the adiabatic, what's that word?

30:31.940 --> 30:33.020
 Adiabatic lapse.

30:33.020 --> 30:34.260
 Adiabatic.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.260
 Right, in aerospace engineering,

30:36.260 --> 30:37.780
 you wanna solve any problem,

30:37.780 --> 30:39.580
 they start with the phrase,

30:39.580 --> 30:41.740
 assume an adiabatic system.

30:41.740 --> 30:44.260
 And what that means is a closed system.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.580
 Okay, got it.

30:45.580 --> 30:48.220
 I've got a container and in that container,

30:48.220 --> 30:50.460
 no air leaves and no air enters,

30:50.460 --> 30:52.420
 no energy exits or enters.

30:52.420 --> 30:54.540
 So it's a closed system.

30:54.540 --> 30:57.100
 So you've got the closed system lapse.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.180
 Okay, what's a closed?

30:59.180 --> 31:00.700
 Okay, I'm gonna use a.

31:00.700 --> 31:02.020
 There's a leak in the ship.

31:02.020 --> 31:04.580
 I'm gonna use a physical metaphor for you

31:04.580 --> 31:06.060
 because you're the jujitsu, right?

31:06.060 --> 31:09.340
 Like you got 10 pints of blood in your body.

31:09.340 --> 31:12.140
 And so before your next workout,

31:12.140 --> 31:14.060
 I'm gonna take one pint from you.

31:15.020 --> 31:17.300
 Now you're gonna go exercise, but you're one pint,

31:17.300 --> 31:19.980
 you've lost 10% of your blood.

31:19.980 --> 31:22.900
 Okay, you're not gonna perform as well.

31:22.900 --> 31:25.460
 It takes about one month for your body

31:25.460 --> 31:27.740
 to replace the Rudd blood platelets.

31:27.740 --> 31:29.300
 So what if I tell you every month,

31:29.300 --> 31:31.900
 you gotta show up and I'm gonna bleed you?

31:31.900 --> 31:35.700
 Okay, so if I'm draining the energy,

31:35.700 --> 31:39.460
 I'm draining the blood from your body, you can't perform.

31:39.460 --> 31:42.780
 If you, adiabatic lapse is when you go up an altitude,

31:42.780 --> 31:45.820
 every 1,000 feet, you lose three degrees.

31:45.820 --> 31:50.220
 You go 50,000 feet, you're 150 degrees colder than sea level.

31:50.220 --> 31:53.580
 That's why you look at your instruments

31:53.580 --> 31:56.780
 and instead of 80 degrees, you're minus 70 degrees.

31:56.780 --> 31:58.900
 Why is the temperature falling?

31:58.900 --> 32:01.820
 Temperature's falling because it's not a closed system.

32:01.820 --> 32:04.500
 It's an open system as the air expands,

32:04.500 --> 32:06.780
 the density falls, right?

32:06.780 --> 32:11.780
 The energy per cubic whatever falls

32:14.940 --> 32:16.900
 and therefore the temperature falls, right?

32:16.900 --> 32:18.940
 The heat's falling out of the solution.

32:18.940 --> 32:21.900
 So when you're inflating,

32:21.900 --> 32:23.540
 let's say you're inflating the money,

32:23.540 --> 32:25.700
 the currency supply by 6%,

32:25.700 --> 32:30.700
 you're sucking 6% of the energy out of the fluid

32:31.860 --> 32:34.620
 that the economy is using to function.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.540
 So the currency, this kind of ocean of currency,

32:37.540 --> 32:39.900
 that's a nice way for the economy to function.

32:39.900 --> 32:41.340
 It's the most kind of,

32:41.340 --> 32:44.500
 it's being inefficient when you expand the money supply,

32:44.500 --> 32:48.300
 but it's the liquid,

32:48.300 --> 32:50.820
 I'm trying to find the right kind of adjective here.

32:50.820 --> 32:54.980
 It's how you do transactions at a scale of billions.

32:54.980 --> 32:57.820
 Currency is the asset we use

32:57.820 --> 33:00.980
 to move monetary energy around and you could use the dollar

33:00.980 --> 33:04.540
 or you could use the peso or you could use the boulevard.

33:04.540 --> 33:08.100
 Selling houses and buying houses is much more inefficient

33:08.100 --> 33:11.580
 or like you can't transact

33:11.580 --> 33:14.700
 between billions of people with houses.

33:14.700 --> 33:18.740
 Yeah, properties don't make such good mediums of exchange.

33:18.740 --> 33:20.860
 They make better stores of value

33:20.860 --> 33:22.740
 and they have utility value

33:22.740 --> 33:27.740
 if it's a ship or a house or a plane or a bushel of corn.

33:28.620 --> 33:29.460
 Right?

33:29.460 --> 33:30.860
 Can I zoom out just for,

33:30.860 --> 33:32.340
 can we zoom out, keep zooming out

33:32.340 --> 33:34.980
 until we reach the origin of human civilization?

33:34.980 --> 33:37.300
 But on the way, ask,

33:37.300 --> 33:39.820
 you gave economists a D minus,

33:39.820 --> 33:42.620
 I'm not even gonna ask you what you give to governments.

33:44.140 --> 33:46.940
 Do you think their failure, economists

33:46.940 --> 33:51.860
 and government failure is malevolence or incompetence?

33:53.020 --> 33:56.300
 I think policymakers are well intentioned

33:56.300 --> 34:00.540
 but generally all government policy is inflationary

34:00.540 --> 34:03.620
 and all government, it's inflammatory and inflationary.

34:03.620 --> 34:06.060
 So what I mean by that is,

34:06.060 --> 34:11.060
 when you have a policy pursuing supply chain independence,

34:12.700 --> 34:15.780
 if you have an energy policy, if you have a labor policy,

34:15.780 --> 34:17.380
 if you have a trade policy,

34:17.380 --> 34:21.100
 if you have any kind of foreign policy,

34:21.100 --> 34:25.020
 a domestic policy, a manufacturing policy,

34:25.020 --> 34:27.780
 every one of these medical policy,

34:27.780 --> 34:32.220
 every one of these policies interferes with the free market

34:32.220 --> 34:36.900
 and generally prevents some rational actor

34:36.900 --> 34:40.140
 from doing it in a cheaper, more efficient way.

34:40.140 --> 34:43.140
 So when you layer them on top of each other,

34:43.140 --> 34:44.940
 they all have to be paid for.

34:44.940 --> 34:47.820
 If you wanna shut down the entire economy for a year,

34:47.820 --> 34:49.300
 you have to pay for it.

34:49.300 --> 34:51.900
 If you wanna fight a war, you have to pay for it.

34:52.940 --> 34:55.540
 If you don't wanna use oil or natural gas,

34:55.540 --> 34:57.020
 you have to pay for it.

34:57.020 --> 35:00.660
 If you don't wanna manufacture semiconductors in China

35:00.660 --> 35:02.540
 and you wanna manufacture them in the US,

35:02.540 --> 35:03.580
 you gotta pay for it.

35:03.580 --> 35:06.860
 If I rebuild the entire supply chain in Pennsylvania

35:06.860 --> 35:08.820
 and I hire a bunch of employees

35:08.820 --> 35:11.460
 and then I unionize the employees,

35:11.460 --> 35:16.460
 then not only am I idle the factory in the Far East,

35:16.860 --> 35:18.500
 it goes to 50% capacity.

35:18.500 --> 35:22.340
 So whatever it sells, it has to raise the price on.

35:22.340 --> 35:24.540
 And then I drive up the cost of labor

35:24.540 --> 35:26.740
 for every other manufacturer in the US

35:26.740 --> 35:30.020
 because I competing against them, right?

35:30.020 --> 35:31.220
 I'm changing that condition.

35:31.220 --> 35:33.580
 So everything gets less efficient,

35:33.580 --> 35:35.580
 everything gets more expensive.

35:35.580 --> 35:38.980
 And of course the government couldn't really pay for

35:38.980 --> 35:42.540
 its policies and its wars with taxes.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.380
 We didn't pay for World War I with tax.

35:44.380 --> 35:46.140
 We didn't pay for World War II with tax.

35:46.140 --> 35:47.860
 We didn't pay for Vietnam with tax.

35:47.860 --> 35:50.060
 In fact, when you trace this,

35:50.060 --> 35:51.700
 what you realize is the government

35:51.700 --> 35:54.260
 never pays for all of its policies with tax.

35:54.260 --> 35:55.100
 It pays for...

35:55.100 --> 35:56.420
 Because it's too painful to ask,

35:56.420 --> 35:58.700
 to raise the taxes to truly,

35:58.700 --> 36:02.660
 transparently pay for the things you're doing with taxes,

36:02.660 --> 36:05.180
 with taxpayer money, because they feel the pain.

36:05.180 --> 36:09.020
 That's one interpretation or it's just too transparent.

36:09.020 --> 36:13.620
 If people understood the true cost of war,

36:13.620 --> 36:15.220
 they wouldn't wanna go to war.

36:15.220 --> 36:20.220
 If you were told that you would lose 95% of your assets

36:21.060 --> 36:23.940
 and 90% of everything you will be ever,

36:23.940 --> 36:25.780
 will be taken from you,

36:25.780 --> 36:30.140
 you might reprioritize your thought about a given policy

36:30.140 --> 36:32.020
 and you might not vote for that politician.

36:32.020 --> 36:35.700
 But you're still saying incompetence, not malevolence.

36:35.700 --> 36:38.860
 So fundamentally, government creates a bureaucracy

36:38.860 --> 36:42.140
 of incompetence is kind of how you look at it.

36:42.140 --> 36:45.260
 I think a lack of humility, right?

36:45.260 --> 36:49.380
 Like, if people had more humility,

36:49.380 --> 36:51.860
 then they would realize...

36:51.860 --> 36:53.900
 Humility about how little they know,

36:53.900 --> 36:56.220
 how little they understand about the function

36:56.220 --> 36:57.060
 of complex systems.

36:57.060 --> 36:59.420
 There's a phrase from Quinneas towards movie Unforgiven

36:59.420 --> 37:02.020
 where he says, a man's gotta know his limitations.

37:02.020 --> 37:07.020
 I think that a lot of people overestimate

37:07.740 --> 37:12.100
 what they can accomplish and experience,

37:12.100 --> 37:17.100
 experience in life causes you to reevaluate that.

37:17.780 --> 37:20.100
 So I mean, I've done a lot of things in my life

37:20.100 --> 37:25.100
 and generally my mistakes were always my good ideas

37:25.300 --> 37:27.900
 that I enthusiastically pursued.

37:27.900 --> 37:31.140
 To the detriment of my great ideas

37:31.140 --> 37:36.140
 that required 150% of my attention to prosper.

37:36.220 --> 37:39.540
 So I think people pursue too many good ideas.

37:39.540 --> 37:41.700
 You know, they all sound good,

37:41.700 --> 37:45.620
 but there's just a limit to what you can accomplish.

37:45.620 --> 37:49.660
 And everybody underestimates the challenges

37:49.660 --> 37:53.340
 of implementing an idea, right?

37:53.340 --> 37:57.540
 And they always overestimate the benefits

37:57.540 --> 37:58.500
 of the pursuit of that.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.100
 And so I think it's an overconfidence

38:01.100 --> 38:05.180
 that causes an over exuberance in pursuit of policies.

38:05.180 --> 38:09.060
 And as the ambition of the government expands,

38:09.060 --> 38:12.660
 so must the currency supply.

38:12.660 --> 38:14.300
 Well, you know, I could say the money supply,

38:14.300 --> 38:16.100
 but let's say the currency supply.

38:17.420 --> 38:21.300
 You can triple the number of pesos in the economy,

38:21.300 --> 38:25.060
 but it doesn't triple the amount of manufacturing capacity

38:25.060 --> 38:26.980
 in the set economy.

38:26.980 --> 38:29.780
 And it doesn't triple the amount of assets in the economy.

38:29.780 --> 38:31.100
 It just triples the pesos.

38:31.100 --> 38:35.580
 So as you increase the currency supply,

38:35.580 --> 38:39.500
 then the price of all those scarce desirable things

38:39.500 --> 38:42.420
 will tend to go up rapidly.

38:42.420 --> 38:47.140
 And the confidence of all of the institutions,

38:47.140 --> 38:50.180
 the corporations and the individual actors

38:50.180 --> 38:53.460
 and trading partners will collapse.

38:53.460 --> 38:55.260
 If we take a tangent on a tangent

38:55.260 --> 39:00.260
 and we will return soon to the big human civilization question.

39:02.980 --> 39:07.660
 So if government naturally wants to buy stuff

39:07.660 --> 39:12.660
 it can't afford, what's the best form of government?

39:13.660 --> 39:17.100
 Anarchism, libertarianism.

39:17.100 --> 39:20.060
 So not even, there's not even armies.

39:20.060 --> 39:21.820
 There's no borders.

39:21.820 --> 39:22.660
 That's anarchism.

39:22.660 --> 39:23.980
 Not least.

39:23.980 --> 39:27.580
 The smallest possible, the smallest possible.

39:27.580 --> 39:29.380
 The best government would be the least

39:29.380 --> 39:32.100
 and the debate will be over that.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.420
 When you think about the stuff, do you think about,

39:34.420 --> 39:36.140
 okay, government is the way it is.

39:36.140 --> 39:39.700
 I, as a person that can generate great ideas,

39:39.700 --> 39:41.420
 how do I operate in this world?

39:41.420 --> 39:43.340
 Or do you also think about the big picture

39:43.340 --> 39:47.460
 if we start a new civilization somewhere on Mars?

39:47.460 --> 39:50.980
 Do you think about what's the ultimate form of government?

39:50.980 --> 39:53.460
 What's at least a promising thing to try?

39:59.100 --> 40:04.100
 You know, I have laser eyes on my profile on Twitter, Lex.

40:06.780 --> 40:07.620
 What does that mean?

40:07.620 --> 40:11.580
 And the significance of laser eyes is to focus

40:11.580 --> 40:14.260
 on the thing that can make a difference.

40:14.260 --> 40:17.800
 And if I look at the civilization,

40:17.800 --> 40:22.800
 I would say half the problems in the civilization

40:24.400 --> 40:27.600
 are due to the fact that our understanding of economics

40:27.600 --> 40:29.400
 and money is defective.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.400
 Half, 50%, I don't know.

40:31.400 --> 40:34.200
 It's worth $500 trillion worth of problems.

40:34.200 --> 40:39.200
 Like money represents all the economic energy

40:40.200 --> 40:41.200
 and the civilization.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.200
 And it kind of equates to all the products,

40:44.200 --> 40:46.600
 all the services and all the assets

40:46.600 --> 40:48.600
 that we have and wherever we're gonna have.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.000
 So that's half.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
 The other half of the problems in the civilization

40:53.000 --> 40:58.000
 are medical and military and political

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
 and philosophical and, you know, and natural.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.800
 And I think that there are a lot of different solutions

41:08.800 --> 41:10.200
 to all those problems.

41:10.200 --> 41:15.200
 And they're all, they are all honorable professions

41:15.200 --> 41:19.200
 and they all merit a lifetime of consideration

41:19.200 --> 41:21.600
 for the specialist in all those areas.

41:22.600 --> 41:27.000
 I think that what I could offer it's constructive is

41:29.600 --> 41:32.400
 inflation is completely misunderstood.

41:32.400 --> 41:36.400
 It's a much bigger problem than we understand it to be.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.400
 We need to introduce engineering and science techniques

41:39.400 --> 41:42.800
 into economics if we wanna further the human condition.

41:42.800 --> 41:47.800
 All government policy is inflationary, you know.

41:47.800 --> 41:52.800
 And another pernicious myth is inflation is always

41:52.800 --> 41:54.800
 and everywhere a monetary phenomena.

41:54.800 --> 41:57.800
 You know, a famous quote by Milton Friedman, I believe.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.800
 It's like, it's a monetary phenomena.

41:59.800 --> 42:02.800
 That is inflation comes from expanding the currency supply.

42:02.800 --> 42:06.800
 It's a nice phrase and it's oftentimes quoted by people

42:06.800 --> 42:08.800
 that are anti inflation.

42:08.800 --> 42:12.800
 But again, it just signifies a lack of appreciation

42:12.800 --> 42:14.800
 of what the issue is.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.800
 Inflation is, if I had a currency

42:17.800 --> 42:20.800
 which was completely non inflationary,

42:20.800 --> 42:23.800
 if I never printed another dollar

42:23.800 --> 42:25.800
 and if I eliminated fractional reserve banking

42:25.800 --> 42:29.800
 from the face of the earth, we'd still have inflation.

42:29.800 --> 42:32.800
 And we'd have inflation as long as we have government

42:32.800 --> 42:37.800
 that is capable of pursuing any kind of policies,

42:37.800 --> 42:40.800
 that are in themselves inflationary

42:40.800 --> 42:42.800
 and generally they all are.

42:42.800 --> 42:47.800
 So in general, inflationary is the big characteristic

42:47.800 --> 42:49.800
 of human nature that governments,

42:49.800 --> 42:52.800
 collection of groups that have power over others

42:52.800 --> 42:54.800
 and allocate other people's resources

42:54.800 --> 42:59.800
 will try to intentionally or not hide the costs

42:59.800 --> 43:03.800
 of those allocations, like in some tricky ways,

43:03.800 --> 43:06.800
 whatever the options are available.

43:06.800 --> 43:11.800
 Hiding the cost is like the tertiary thing.

43:11.800 --> 43:16.800
 The primary goal is the government will attempt to do good.

43:16.800 --> 43:20.800
 That's the primary problem?

43:20.800 --> 43:25.800
 They will attempt to do good and they will do good imperfectly

43:25.800 --> 43:29.800
 and they will create oftentimes as much damage,

43:29.800 --> 43:31.800
 more damage than the good they do.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.800
 Most government policy will be iatrogenic.

43:34.800 --> 43:37.800
 It will create more harm than good in the pursuit of it,

43:37.800 --> 43:39.800
 but it is what it is.

43:39.800 --> 43:46.800
 The secondary issue is they will unintentionally pay for it

43:46.800 --> 43:50.800
 by expanding the currency supply without realizing

43:50.800 --> 43:58.800
 that they're actually paying for it in a suboptimal fashion.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.800
 They'll collapse their own currencies

44:00.800 --> 44:02.800
 while they attempt to do good.

44:02.800 --> 44:06.800
 The tertiary issue is they will mismeasure

44:06.800 --> 44:09.800
 how badly they're collapsing the currency.

44:09.800 --> 44:13.800
 For example, if you go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics

44:13.800 --> 44:15.800
 and look at the numbers printed by the Fed,

44:15.800 --> 44:18.800
 they'll say, oh, it looks like the dollar has lost

44:18.800 --> 44:22.800
 95% of its purchasing power over 100 years.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.800
 They sort of fess up that there's a problem,

44:24.800 --> 44:27.800
 but they make it 95% loss over 100 years.

44:27.800 --> 44:33.800
 What they don't do is realize it's a 99.7% loss over 80 years,

44:33.800 --> 44:37.800
 so they will mismeasure just the horrific extent

44:37.800 --> 44:43.800
 of the monetary policy in pursuit of the foreign policy

44:43.800 --> 44:45.800
 and the domestic policy,

44:45.800 --> 44:50.800
 which they overestimate their budget

44:50.800 --> 44:53.800
 and their means to accomplish their ends

44:53.800 --> 44:56.800
 and they underestimate the cost

44:56.800 --> 45:01.800
 and they're oblivious to the horrific damage

45:01.800 --> 45:03.800
 that they do to the civilization

45:03.800 --> 45:06.800
 because the mental models that they use

45:06.800 --> 45:09.800
 that are conventionally taught are wrong.

45:09.800 --> 45:12.800
 The mental model that...

45:12.800 --> 45:14.800
 It's okay, we can print all this money

45:14.800 --> 45:18.800
 because the velocity of the money is low,

45:18.800 --> 45:20.800
 because money velocity is a scalar

45:20.800 --> 45:22.800
 and inflation is a scalar

45:22.800 --> 45:24.800
 and we don't see 2% inflation yet

45:24.800 --> 45:26.800
 and the money velocity is low

45:26.800 --> 45:29.800
 and so it's okay if we print trillions of dollars.

45:29.800 --> 45:33.800
 Well, the money velocity was immediate.

45:33.800 --> 45:37.800
 The velocity of money through the crypto economy

45:37.800 --> 45:40.800
 is 10,000 times faster

45:40.800 --> 45:45.800
 than the velocity of money through the consumer economy.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.800
 I think Nick pointed out when you spoke to him,

45:47.800 --> 45:49.800
 he said it takes two months

45:49.800 --> 45:52.800
 for a credit card transaction to settle.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.800
 If you want to spend a million dollars

45:54.800 --> 45:56.800
 in the consumer economy,

45:56.800 --> 45:58.800
 you can move it six times a year.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.800
 You put a million dollars in a gold.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.800
 Gold will sit in a vault for a decade.

46:03.800 --> 46:07.800
 Okay, so the velocity of money through gold is 0.1.

46:07.800 --> 46:09.800
 You put the money in the stock market

46:09.800 --> 46:11.800
 and you can trade it once a week.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.800
 The settlement is T plus two.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.800
 Maybe you get to two to one leverage.

46:15.800 --> 46:18.800
 You might get to a money velocity of 100 a year

46:18.800 --> 46:20.800
 in the stock market.

46:20.800 --> 46:22.800
 You put the money into the crypto economy

46:22.800 --> 46:25.800
 and these people are settling every four hours.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.800
 And if you're offshore,

46:27.800 --> 46:29.800
 they're trading with 20X leverage.

46:29.800 --> 46:32.800
 So if you settle every day

46:32.800 --> 46:34.800
 and you trade with 20X leverage,

46:34.800 --> 46:37.800
 you just went to 7,000.

46:37.800 --> 46:41.800
 So the velocity of the money varies.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.800
 I think the politicians,

46:43.800 --> 46:45.800
 they don't really understand inflation

46:45.800 --> 46:47.800
 and they don't understand economics,

46:47.800 --> 46:49.800
 but you can't blame them

46:49.800 --> 46:52.800
 because the economists don't understand economics

46:52.800 --> 46:54.800
 because if they did,

46:54.800 --> 46:59.800
 they would be creating multivariate computer simulations

46:59.800 --> 47:02.800
 where they actually put in the price

47:02.800 --> 47:05.800
 of every piece of housing in every city in the world,

47:05.800 --> 47:07.800
 the full array of foods

47:07.800 --> 47:09.800
 and the full array of products

47:09.800 --> 47:11.800
 and the full array of assets.

47:11.800 --> 47:14.800
 And then on a monthly basis,

47:14.800 --> 47:17.800
 they would publish all those results.

47:17.800 --> 47:21.800
 And that's a high bandwidth requirement.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.800
 And I think the people don't really want to embrace it.

47:24.800 --> 47:28.800
 And also there's the most pernicious thing.

47:28.800 --> 47:30.800
 There's that phrase,

47:30.800 --> 47:33.800
 you can't tell people what to think,

47:33.800 --> 47:35.800
 but you can tell them what to think about.

47:35.800 --> 47:38.800
 The most pernicious thing is,

47:38.800 --> 47:42.800
 I get you to misunderstand the phenomena

47:42.800 --> 47:46.800
 so that even when it's happening to you,

47:46.800 --> 47:48.800
 you don't appreciate that it's a bad thing

47:48.800 --> 47:50.800
 and you think it's a good thing.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.800
 So if housing prices are going up 20% year over year

47:53.800 --> 47:55.800
 and I say this is great for the American public

47:55.800 --> 47:57.800
 because most of them are homeowners,

47:57.800 --> 48:01.800
 then I have misrepresented a phenomena.

48:01.800 --> 48:05.800
 Inflation is 20%, not 7%,

48:05.800 --> 48:07.800
 and then I have misrepresented it

48:07.800 --> 48:10.800
 as being a positive rather than a negative

48:10.800 --> 48:12.800
 and people will stare at it

48:12.800 --> 48:16.800
 and you could even show them their house on fire

48:16.800 --> 48:18.800
 and they would perceive it as being great

48:18.800 --> 48:20.800
 because it's warming them up

48:20.800 --> 48:22.800
 and they're going to save on their heat costs.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.800
 It does seem that the cruder the model,

48:24.800 --> 48:28.800
 whether it's economics, whether it's psychology,

48:28.800 --> 48:32.800
 the easier it is to weave whatever the heck narrative you want

48:32.800 --> 48:35.800
 and not in a malicious way,

48:35.800 --> 48:40.800
 but just like it's some kind of like a emergent phenomena,

48:40.800 --> 48:42.800
 this narrative thing that we tell ourselves.

48:42.800 --> 48:45.800
 So you can tell any kind of story about inflation.

48:45.800 --> 48:47.800
 Inflation is good, inflation is bad.

48:47.800 --> 48:48.800
 Like the cruder the model,

48:48.800 --> 48:51.800
 the easier it is to tell a narrative about it.

48:51.800 --> 48:54.800
 So like if you take an engineering approach,

48:54.800 --> 48:58.800
 I feel like it becomes more and more difficult

48:58.800 --> 49:02.800
 to run away from sort of a true deep understanding

49:02.800 --> 49:05.800
 of the dynamics of the system.

49:05.800 --> 49:08.800
 I mean, honestly, if you went to 100 people on the street

49:08.800 --> 49:10.800
 and you asked them to define inflation,

49:10.800 --> 49:13.800
 how many would say it's a vector

49:13.800 --> 49:16.800
 tracking the change in price

49:16.800 --> 49:21.800
 of every product service asset in the world over time?

49:21.800 --> 49:23.800
 Not many.

49:23.800 --> 49:26.800
 If you went to them and you said,

49:26.800 --> 49:30.800
 do you think 2% inflation a year is good or bad?

49:30.800 --> 49:33.800
 The majority would probably say, well, here it's good.

49:33.800 --> 49:35.800
 The majority of economists would say,

49:35.800 --> 49:39.800
 2% inflation a year is good.

49:39.800 --> 49:42.800
 And of course, look at the ship next to us.

49:42.800 --> 49:50.800
 What if I told you that the ship leaked 2% of its volume

49:50.800 --> 49:51.800
 every something, right?

49:51.800 --> 49:53.800
 The ship is rotting 2% a year.

49:53.800 --> 49:56.800
 That means the useful life of the ship is 50 years.

49:56.800 --> 49:57.800
 Now, ironically, that's true.

49:57.800 --> 50:01.800
 Like a wooden ship had a 50 year to 100 year life,

50:01.800 --> 50:04.800
 100 be long, 50 years, not unlikely.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.800
 So when we built ships out of wood,

50:06.800 --> 50:09.800
 they had a useful life of about 50 years,

50:09.800 --> 50:12.800
 and then they sunk, they rotted.

50:12.800 --> 50:14.800
 There's nothing good about it, right?

50:14.800 --> 50:17.800
 You build a ship out of steel, you know,

50:17.800 --> 50:21.800
 and it's zero as opposed to 2% degradation.

50:21.800 --> 50:24.800
 And how much better is 0% versus 2%?

50:24.800 --> 50:29.800
 Well, 2% means you have a useful life of, you know,

50:29.800 --> 50:32.800
 it's half life at 35 years.

50:32.800 --> 50:34.800
 2% is a half life of 35 years.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.800
 That's basically the half life of money and gold.

50:37.800 --> 50:41.800
 If I store your life force in gold under perfect circumstances,

50:41.800 --> 50:44.800
 you have a useful life of 35 years.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.800
 0% is a useful life of forever.

50:47.800 --> 50:50.800
 So 0% is immortal.

50:50.800 --> 50:55.800
 2% is 35 years average life expectancy.

50:55.800 --> 50:58.800
 So the idea that you would think the life expectancy

50:58.800 --> 51:00.800
 of the currency and the civilization

51:00.800 --> 51:04.800
 should be 35 years instead of forever is kind of a silly notion.

51:04.800 --> 51:08.800
 But the tragic notion is it was, you know,

51:08.800 --> 51:11.800
 seven into 70 or 10 years.

51:11.800 --> 51:14.800
 Money has had a half life of 10 years,

51:14.800 --> 51:19.800
 except for the fact that in weak societies in Argentina

51:19.800 --> 51:23.800
 or the like, the half life of the money is three to four years

51:23.800 --> 51:25.800
 in Venezuela one year.

51:25.800 --> 51:30.800
 So the United States dollar and the United States

51:30.800 --> 51:34.800
 economic system was the most successful economic system

51:34.800 --> 51:36.800
 in the last 100 years in the world.

51:36.800 --> 51:37.800
 We won every war.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.800
 We were the world superpower.

51:39.800 --> 51:42.800
 Our currency lost 99.7% of its value.

51:42.800 --> 51:48.800
 And that means horrifically every other currency lost everything.

51:48.800 --> 51:49.800
 Right.

51:49.800 --> 51:53.800
 In essence, the other ones were 99.9% except for most

51:53.800 --> 51:57.800
 that were 100% because they all completely failed.

51:57.800 --> 52:02.800
 And, you know, you've got a mainstream economic community,

52:02.800 --> 52:06.800
 you know, that thinks that inflation is a number

52:06.800 --> 52:09.800
 and 2% is desirable.

52:09.800 --> 52:13.800
 It's kind of like, you know,

52:13.800 --> 52:16.800
 remember George Washington, you know how he died?

52:16.800 --> 52:22.800
 Well, meaning physicians bled him to death.

52:22.800 --> 52:23.800
 Okay.

52:23.800 --> 52:27.800
 The last thing in the world you would want to do to a sick person

52:27.800 --> 52:30.800
 is bleed them, right, in the modern world.

52:30.800 --> 52:34.800
 I think we understand that oxygen is carried by the blood cells

52:34.800 --> 52:42.800
 and, you know, and if, you know, there's that phrase, right,

52:42.800 --> 52:46.800
 a triage phrase, what's the first thing you do in an injury?

52:46.800 --> 52:48.800
 Stop the bleeding.

52:48.800 --> 52:49.800
 Single first thing, right?

52:49.800 --> 52:51.800
 You show up after any action.

52:51.800 --> 52:52.800
 Look at you.

52:52.800 --> 52:55.800
 Stop the bleeding because you're going to be dead in a matter

52:55.800 --> 52:57.800
 of minutes if you bleed out.

52:57.800 --> 53:02.800
 So it strikes me as being ironic that Orthodox conventional

53:02.800 --> 53:05.800
 wisdom was bleed the patient to death.

53:05.800 --> 53:08.800
 And this was the most important patient in the country,

53:08.800 --> 53:10.800
 maybe in the history of the country.

53:10.800 --> 53:13.800
 And it's, and we bled him to death trying to help him.

53:13.800 --> 53:18.800
 So when you're actually inflating the money supply at 7%,

53:18.800 --> 53:22.800
 but you're calling it 2% because you want to help the economy,

53:22.800 --> 53:27.800
 you're literally bleeding the free market to death.

53:27.800 --> 53:31.800
 But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it

53:31.800 --> 53:34.800
 because he thought that they were going to do him good.

53:34.800 --> 53:39.800
 And the majority of the society, most companies,

53:39.800 --> 53:44.800
 most conventional thinkers, you know, the working class,

53:44.800 --> 53:48.800
 they go along with this because they think that someone has

53:48.800 --> 53:51.800
 their best interest in mind and the people that are bleeding

53:51.800 --> 53:55.800
 them to death believe, they believe that prescription

53:55.800 --> 53:58.800
 because their mental models are just so defective.

53:58.800 --> 54:03.800
 And then an understanding of energy and engineering

54:03.800 --> 54:09.800
 and the economics that are at play is crippled

54:09.800 --> 54:11.800
 by these mental models.

54:11.800 --> 54:13.800
 But that's both the bug in the feature of human civilization

54:13.800 --> 54:15.800
 that ideas take hold.

54:15.800 --> 54:16.800
 They unite us.

54:16.800 --> 54:19.800
 We believe in them.

54:19.800 --> 54:24.800
 And we make a lot of cool stuff happen by,

54:24.800 --> 54:28.800
 as an average sort of, just the fact of the matter,

54:28.800 --> 54:30.800
 a lot of people believe the same thing.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.800
 They get together and they get some shit done

54:33.800 --> 54:35.800
 because they believe that thing.

54:35.800 --> 54:39.800
 And then some ideas can be really bad and really destructive.

54:39.800 --> 54:43.800
 But on average, the ideas seem to be progressing

54:43.800 --> 54:44.800
 in a direction of good.

54:44.800 --> 54:46.800
 Let me just step back.

54:46.800 --> 54:48.800
 What the hell are we doing here?

54:48.800 --> 54:50.800
 Us humans on this earth.

54:50.800 --> 54:52.800
 How do you think of humans?

54:52.800 --> 54:54.800
 How special are humans?

54:54.800 --> 54:58.800
 How did human civilization originate on this earth?

54:58.800 --> 55:02.800
 And what is this human project that we're all taking on?

55:02.800 --> 55:06.800
 You mentioned fire and water and apparently bleeding you

55:06.800 --> 55:08.800
 to death is not a good idea.

55:08.800 --> 55:11.800
 I always thought you can get the demons out in that way.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.800
 But that was a recent invention.

55:14.800 --> 55:19.800
 So what's this thing we're doing here?

55:19.800 --> 55:22.800
 I think what distinguishes human beings

55:22.800 --> 55:25.800
 from all the other creatures on the earth

55:25.800 --> 55:29.800
 is our ability to engineer.

55:29.800 --> 55:31.800
 We're engineers, right?

55:31.800 --> 55:37.800
 To solve problems or just build incredible cool things.

55:37.800 --> 55:41.800
 Engineering, harnessing energy and technique

55:41.800 --> 55:45.800
 to make the world a better place than you found it.

55:45.800 --> 55:50.800
 From the point that we actually started to play with fire,

55:50.800 --> 55:53.800
 that was a big leap forward.

55:53.800 --> 55:57.800
 Harnessing the power of kinetic energy and missiles,

55:57.800 --> 56:00.800
 another step forward.

56:00.800 --> 56:03.800
 Every city built on water.

56:03.800 --> 56:04.800
 Why water?

56:04.800 --> 56:07.800
 Well, water is bringing energy.

56:07.800 --> 56:12.800
 If you actually put a turbine on a river

56:12.800 --> 56:16.800
 or you capture a change in elevation of water,

56:16.800 --> 56:18.800
 you've literally harnessed gravitational energy.

56:18.800 --> 56:21.800
 But water is also bringing you food.

56:21.800 --> 56:27.800
 It's also giving you a cheap form of getting rid of your waste.

56:27.800 --> 56:29.800
 It's also giving you free transportation.

56:29.800 --> 56:32.800
 You want to move one ton blocks around.

56:32.800 --> 56:34.800
 You want to move them in water.

56:34.800 --> 56:38.800
 I think the human story is really the story

56:38.800 --> 56:42.800
 of engineering a better world.

56:42.800 --> 56:47.800
 The rise in the human condition is determined

56:47.800 --> 56:50.800
 by those groups of people, those civilizations

56:50.800 --> 56:54.800
 that were best at harnessing energy.

56:54.800 --> 56:57.800
 If you look at the Greek civilization,

56:57.800 --> 57:00.800
 they built it around ports and seaports

57:00.800 --> 57:03.800
 and water and created a trading network.

57:03.800 --> 57:06.800
 The Romans were really good at harnessing

57:06.800 --> 57:08.800
 all sorts of engineering.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.800
 I mean, the aqueducts are a great example.

57:11.800 --> 57:15.800
 If you go to any big city, you travel through cities in the med,

57:15.800 --> 57:18.800
 you find that the carrying capacity of the city

57:18.800 --> 57:21.800
 or the island is 5,000 people without running water.

57:21.800 --> 57:24.800
 And then if you can find a way to bring water to it,

57:24.800 --> 57:26.800
 it increases by a factor of 10.

57:26.800 --> 57:30.800
 And so human flourishing is really only possible

57:30.800 --> 57:34.800
 through that channeling of energy, right?

57:34.800 --> 57:40.800
 That eventually takes the form of air power, right?

57:40.800 --> 57:45.800
 I mean, that ship, I mean, look at the intricacy of those sails.

57:45.800 --> 57:48.800
 I mean, it's just the model is intricate.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.800
 Now think about all of the experimentation

57:50.800 --> 57:53.800
 that took place to figure out how many sails to put on that ship

57:53.800 --> 57:56.800
 and how to rig them and how to repair them

57:56.800 --> 57:59.800
 and how to operate them.

57:59.800 --> 58:03.800
 It's thousands of lives spent thinking through

58:03.800 --> 58:05.800
 all the tiny little details,

58:05.800 --> 58:08.800
 all to increase the efficiency of this,

58:08.800 --> 58:11.800
 the effectiveness, the efficiency of this ship

58:11.800 --> 58:13.800
 as it sails through water.

58:13.800 --> 58:16.800
 And we should also note there's a bunch of cannons on the side,

58:16.800 --> 58:17.800
 so obviously.

58:17.800 --> 58:20.800
 Another form of engineering, right?

58:20.800 --> 58:23.800
 Energy harnessing with explosives.

58:23.800 --> 58:24.800
 To achieve what end?

58:24.800 --> 58:26.800
 That's another discussion, exactly.

58:26.800 --> 58:29.800
 Suppose we're trying to get off the planet, right?

58:29.800 --> 58:31.800
 Well, there's a selection mechanism going on.

58:31.800 --> 58:35.800
 So natural selection, whatever, however evolution works,

58:35.800 --> 58:38.800
 it seems that one of the interesting inventions on Earth

58:38.800 --> 58:41.800
 was the predator prey dynamic,

58:41.800 --> 58:44.800
 that you want to be the bigger fish.

58:44.800 --> 58:47.800
 That violence seems to serve a useful purpose

58:47.800 --> 58:49.800
 if you look at Earth as a whole.

58:49.800 --> 58:53.800
 We as humans now like to think of violence

58:53.800 --> 58:55.800
 as really a bad thing.

58:55.800 --> 58:58.800
 It seems to be one of the amazing things about humans

58:58.800 --> 59:01.800
 is we're ultimately 10 towards cooperation.

59:01.800 --> 59:03.800
 We like peace.

59:03.800 --> 59:06.800
 If you just look at history,

59:06.800 --> 59:08.800
 we want things to be nice and calm.

59:08.800 --> 59:13.800
 But just wars break out every once in a while

59:13.800 --> 59:17.800
 and lead to immense suffering and destruction and so on.

59:17.800 --> 59:25.800
 And they have a kind of like resetting the palate effect.

59:25.800 --> 59:30.800
 It's one that's full of just immeasurable human suffering,

59:30.800 --> 59:33.800
 but it's like a way to start over.

59:33.800 --> 59:36.800
 We're quite the apex predator on the planet.

59:36.800 --> 59:39.800
 I googled something the other day.

59:39.800 --> 59:46.800
 What's the most common form of mammal life on Earth?

59:46.800 --> 59:48.800
 Life by number of organisms.

59:48.800 --> 59:49.800
 Count.

59:49.800 --> 59:52.800
 And the answer that came back was human beings.

59:52.800 --> 59:53.800
 I was shocked.

59:53.800 --> 59:55.800
 I couldn't believe it, right?

59:55.800 --> 59:57.800
 Apparently, if we're just looking at mammals,

59:57.800 --> 59:59.800
 the answer was human beings are the most common,

59:59.800 --> 1:00:01.800
 which was very interesting to me.

1:00:01.800 --> 1:00:03.800
 I didn't believe it,

1:00:03.800 --> 1:00:06.800
 but I was trying to, you know, 8 billion or so human beings.

1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:09.800
 There's no other mammal that's got more than 8 billion.

1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:12.800
 If you walk through downtown Edinburgh and Scotland

1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:15.800
 and you look up on this hill and this castle up on the hill,

1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:20.800
 you know, and you talk to people and the story is,

1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:24.800
 oh yeah, well, that was a British castle before the Scottish castle,

1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:27.800
 before it was a Pick Castle, before it was a Roman castle,

1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:31.800
 before it was, you know, some other Celtic castle,

1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:35.800
 before, you know, then they found 13 prehistoric castles

1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:37.800
 buried one under the other under the other.

1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:41.800
 And you get the conclusion that 100,000 years ago,

1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:46.800
 somebody showed up and grabbed the high point, the apex of the city,

1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:50.800
 and they built a stronghold there and they flourished

1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:52.800
 and their family flourished and their tribe flourished

1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:55.800
 until someone came along and knocked them off the hill.

1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:59.800
 And it's been a nonstop, never ending fight

1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:04.800
 by the aggressive, most powerful entity, family,

1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:07.800
 organization, municipality, tribe, whatever.

1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:08.800
 All for the hill.

1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:13.800
 For that one hill, going back since time immemorial.

1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:19.800
 And, you know, you scratch your head and you think,

1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:23.800
 it seems like it's like just this never ending wheel.

1:01:23.800 --> 1:01:27.800
 But doesn't that lead if you just, all kinds of metrics

1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:32.800
 that seems to improve the quality of our cannons and ships as a result?

1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:36.800
 Like it seems that war, just like your laser eyes

1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:39.800
 focuses the mind on the engineering tasks.

1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:40.800
 It is that.

1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:47.800
 And it does remind you that the winner is always the most powerful.

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:50.800
 And we throw that phrase out,

1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:52.800
 but no one thinks about what that phrase means.

1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:56.800
 Like who's the most powerful or the, you know,

1:01:56.800 --> 1:01:59.800
 or the most powerful side one, but they don't think about it.

1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:04.800
 And they think about power, energy delivered in a period of time.

1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:09.800
 And then you think a guy with a spear is more powerful than someone

1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:12.800
 with their fists and somewhere the bow and arrow is more powerful

1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:14.800
 than the person with the spear.

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:17.800
 And then you realize that somebody with bronze is more powerful

1:02:17.800 --> 1:02:21.800
 than without and steel is more powerful than bronze.

1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:23.800
 And if you look at the Romans, you know,

1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:26.800
 they persevered, you know, with artillery and they could stand

1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:30.800
 off from 800 meters and blast you to smithereens, right?

1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:35.800
 You know, you study the history of the Bolarex slingers, right?

1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:37.800
 And, you know, you think we invented bullets,

1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:42.800
 but they invented bullets to put in slings thousands of years ago.

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:46.800
 They could have stood off 500 meters and put a hole in your head, right?

1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:55.800
 And so there was never a time when humanity wasn't vying to come

1:02:55.800 --> 1:03:01.800
 up with an asymmetric form of projecting their own power via technology.

1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:07.800
 And absolute power is when a leader is able to control large amount

1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:12.800
 of humans, they're facing the same direction,

1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:16.800
 working in the same direction to leverage energy.

1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:19.800
 The most organized society wins.

1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:20.800
 Yeah.

1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:23.800
 When the Romans were dominating everybody,

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:27.800
 they were the most organized civilization in Europe.

1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:31.800
 As long as they stayed organized, they dominated,

1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:34.800
 and at some point they over expanded and got disorganized

1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:36.800
 and they collapsed.

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:39.800
 And I guess you could say that, you know, the struggle

1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:43.800
 of human condition, it catalyzes the development

1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:45.800
 of new technologies one after the other.

1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:51.800
 It penalizes anybody that rejects ocean power, right?

1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:54.800
 It gets penalized, you reject artillery, you get penalized,

1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:57.800
 you reject atomic power, you get penalized.

1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:02.800
 If you reject digital power, cyber power, you get penalized.

1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:08.800
 And the underlying control of the property keeps shifting hands

1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:13.800
 from, you know, one institution or one government to another

1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:16.800
 based upon how rationally they're able to channel that energy

1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:20.800
 and how well organized or coordinated they are.

1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:23.800
 That's a really interesting thing about both human mind

1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:26.800
 and governments, that they, once they get a few good,

1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:28.800
 and companies, once they get a few good ideas,

1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:30.800
 they seem to stick with them.

1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:32.800
 They reject new ideas.

1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:38.800
 It's almost, whether that's emergent or however that evolved,

1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:40.800
 it seems to have a really interesting effect,

1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:44.800
 because when you're young, you fight for the new ideas.

1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:49.800
 You push them through, then a few of us humans find success,

1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:53.800
 then we get complacent, we take over the world

1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:57.800
 using that new idea, and then the new young person

1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:01.800
 with a better new idea challenges you,

1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:05.800
 and you, as opposed to pivoting, you stick with the old

1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:08.800
 and lose because of it, and that's how empires collapse.

1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:11.800
 And it's just both at the individual level that happens,

1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:14.800
 with two academics fighting about ideas or something like that,

1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:19.800
 and at the human civilization level, governments,

1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:23.800
 they hold on to the ideas of old. It's fascinating.

1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:27.800
 Yeah, an ever persistent theme in the history of science

1:05:27.800 --> 1:05:30.800
 is the paradigm shift, and the paradigms shift

1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:34.800
 when the old guard dies and a new generation arrives,

1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:37.800
 or the paradigm shifts when there's a war,

1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:42.800
 and everyone that disagrees with the idea of aviation

1:05:42.800 --> 1:05:44.800
 finds bombs dropping on their head,

1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:47.800
 or everyone that disagrees with whatever your technology is

1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:50.800
 as a rude awakening, and if they totally disagree,

1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:56.800
 their society collapses and they're replaced by that new thing.

1:05:56.800 --> 1:05:58.800
 A lot of the engineering you talked about

1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:03.800
 had to do with ships and cannons and leveraging water.

1:06:03.800 --> 1:06:06.800
 What about this whole digital thing that's happening?

1:06:06.800 --> 1:06:10.800
 It's been happening over the past century.

1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:13.800
 Is that still engineering in your mind?

1:06:13.800 --> 1:06:18.800
 You're starting to operate in these bits of information.

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:20.800
 I think there's two big ideas.

1:06:20.800 --> 1:06:24.800
 The first wave of ideas were digital information,

1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:30.800
 and that was the internet wave that's been running since 1990 or so for 30 years.

1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:33.800
 And the second wave is digital energy.

1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:37.800
 So if I look at digital information,

1:06:37.800 --> 1:06:42.800
 this idea that we want to digitally transform a book,

1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:47.800
 I'm going to dematerialize every book in this room into bits,

1:06:47.800 --> 1:06:51.800
 and then I'm going to deliver a copy of the entire library

1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:54.800
 to a billion people, and I'm going to do it

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:58.800
 for pretty much de minimis electricity.

1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:03.800
 If I can dematerialize music, books, education,

1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:08.800
 entertainment, maps.

1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:14.800
 That is an incredibly exothermic transaction.

1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:19.800
 It's a crystallization when we collapse into a lower energy state as a civilization,

1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:22.800
 and we give off massive amounts of energy.

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:24.800
 If you look at what Carnegie did,

1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:27.800
 the richest man in the world created libraries everywhere at the time,

1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:29.800
 and he gave away his entire fortune.

1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:34.800
 And now we can give a better library to every six year old for nothing.

1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:40.800
 And so what's the value of giving a million books to eight billion people?

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:46.800
 That's the explosion in prosperity that comes from digital transformation.

1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:51.800
 And when we do it with maps, I transform the map,

1:07:51.800 --> 1:07:53.800
 I put it into a car, you get in the car,

1:07:53.800 --> 1:07:56.800
 and the car drives you where you want to go with the map.

1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:00.800
 And how much better is that than a Ram McNally Atlas right here?

1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:03.800
 It's like a million times better.

1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:07.800
 So the first wave of digital transformation

1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:12.800
 was the dematerialization of all of these informational things,

1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:14.800
 which are non conservative.

1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:17.800
 I could take Beethoven's Fifth Symphony,

1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:20.800
 played for by the best orchestra in Germany,

1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:22.800
 and I could give it to a billion people,

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:26.800
 and they could play it a thousand times each

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:29.800
 at less than the cost of the one performance, right?

1:08:29.800 --> 1:08:34.800
 So I deliver culture and education and erudition and intelligence

1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:39.800
 and insight to the entire civilization over digital rails.

1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:44.800
 And the consequence of the human race are first order generally good, right?

1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:47.800
 The world is a better place, it drives growth.

1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:51.800
 And you create these trillion dollar entities like Apple and Amazon and Facebook

1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:54.800
 and Google and Microsoft, right?

1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:57.800
 That is the first wave, the second wave.

1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:58.800
 Do you mind?

1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:02.800
 I'm sorry to interrupt, but that first wave,

1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:07.800
 it feels like the impact that's positive,

1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:10.800
 you said the first order impact is generally positive.

1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:14.800
 It feels like it's positive in a way that nothing else in history has been positive.

1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:21.800
 And then we may not actually truly be able to understand

1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:25.800
 the orders and magnitude of increase in productivity

1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:29.800
 and just progress and human civilization

1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:32.800
 until we look back centuries from now.

1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:37.800
 It just feels, or maybe just looking at the impact of Wikipedia.

1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:38.800
 Right.

1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:43.800
 Giving access to basic wisdom or basic knowledge

1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:47.800
 and then perhaps wisdom to billions of people.

1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:49.800
 If you can just linger on that for a second,

1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:53.800
 what's your sense of the impact of that?

1:09:53.800 --> 1:10:02.800
 You know, I would say if you're a technologist, philosopher,

1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:07.800
 the impact of a technology is so much greater on the civilization

1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:11.800
 and the human condition than a non technology

1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:13.800
 that is almost not worth your trouble to bother

1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:16.800
 trying to fix things a conventional way.

1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:19.800
 So let's take an example.

1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:22.800
 I have a foundation, the Sailor Academy,

1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:26.800
 and the Sailor Academy gives away free education,

1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:30.800
 free college education to anybody on Earth that wants it.

1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:32.800
 And we've had more than a million students.

1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:35.800
 And if you go and you take the physics class,

1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:38.800
 the lectures were by the same physics lecture

1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:40.800
 that taught me physics at MIT.

1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:43.800
 Except when I was at MIT,

1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:46.800
 the cost of the first four weeks of MIT

1:10:46.800 --> 1:10:50.800
 would have drained my family's collective life savings

1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:52.800
 for the first last 100 years.

1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:55.800
 Like 100 years worth of my father, my grandfather,

1:10:55.800 --> 1:10:58.800
 my great grandfather, they saved every penny they had

1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:00.800
 after 100 years they could have paid for one week

1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:02.800
 or two weeks of MIT.

1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:05.800
 That's how fiendishly expensive and inefficient it was.

1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:07.800
 So I went on scholarship.

1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:09.800
 I was lucky to have a scholarship.

1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:12.800
 But on the other hand,

1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:16.800
 I sat in the back of the 801 lecture hall

1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:18.800
 and I was like right up in the rafters.

1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:21.800
 It's an awful experience on these like uncomfortable

1:11:21.800 --> 1:11:24.800
 wooden benches and you can barely see the blackboard.

1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:27.800
 And you got to be there synchronously.

1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:29.800
 And the stuff we upload,

1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:32.800
 you can start it and stop it and watch it on your iPad

1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:35.800
 or watch it on your computer and rewind it multiple times

1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:37.800
 and sit in a comfortable chair

1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:39.800
 and you can do it from anywhere on earth

1:11:39.800 --> 1:11:41.800
 and it's absolutely free.

1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:43.800
 So I think about this and I think

1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:46.800
 you want to improve the human condition.

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:51.800
 You need people with postgraduate level education.

1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:52.800
 You need PhDs.

1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:54.800
 And I know this sounds kind of elitist,

1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:56.800
 but you want to cure cancer and you know,

1:11:56.800 --> 1:12:00.800
 you want to go to the stars, fusion drive.

1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:02.800
 We need new propulsion, right?

1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:06.800
 We need extraordinary breakthroughs

1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:09.800
 in every area of basic science,

1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:12.800
 you know, be it biology or propulsion

1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:15.800
 or material science or computer science.

1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:18.800
 You're not doing that with an undergraduate degree.

1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:21.800
 You're certainly not doing it with a high school education.

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:24.800
 But the cost of a PhD is like a million bucks.

1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:27.800
 There's like 10 million PhDs in the world.

1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:29.800
 If you go do the, if you check it out,

1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:31.800
 there's eight billion people in the world.

1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:34.800
 How many people could get a PhD or would want to?

1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:37.800
 Maybe not eight billion, but a billion, 500 million.

1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:40.800
 Let's just say 500 million to a billion.

1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:43.800
 How do you go from 10 million to a billion

1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:48.800
 highly educated people, all of them specializing in,

1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:51.800
 and I don't have to tell you how many different fields

1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:53.800
 of human endeavor there are.

1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:55.800
 I mean, your life is interviewing these experts

1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:59.800
 and there's so many, right?

1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:01.800
 You know, it's amazing.

1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:05.800
 So how do I give a multimillion dollar education

1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:07.800
 to a billion people?

1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:09.800
 And there's two choices.

1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:11.800
 You can either endow a scholarship,

1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:14.800
 in which case you pay $75,000 a year.

1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:16.800
 Okay, $75,000.

1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:20.800
 Let's pay a million dollars and a million dollars a person.

1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:22.800
 I can do it that way.

1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:26.800
 And you're never, even if you had a trillion dollars,

1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:29.800
 if you had $10 trillion to throw at the problem,

1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:33.800
 and we've just thrown $10 trillion at certain problems,

1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:36.800
 you don't solve the problem, right?

1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:38.800
 If I put $10 trillion on the table and I said,

1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:40.800
 educate everybody, give them all a PhD,

1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:42.800
 you still wouldn't solve the problem.

1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:47.800
 Harvard University can't educate 18,000 people simultaneously

1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:51.800
 or $87,000 or $800,000 or $8 million.

1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:53.800
 So you have to dematerialize the professor

1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:55.800
 and dematerialize the experience.

1:13:55.800 --> 1:13:58.800
 So you put it all as streaming, on demand,

1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:01.800
 computer generated education,

1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:05.800
 and you create simulations where you need to create simulations,

1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:07.800
 and you upload it.

1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:10.800
 It's like the human condition is being held back

1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:18.800
 by 500,000 well meaning average algebra teachers.

1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:20.800
 I love them.

1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:23.800
 I mean, please don't take offense if you're an algebra teacher,

1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:26.800
 but instead of 500,000 algebra teachers

1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:30.800
 going through the same motion over and over again,

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:34.800
 what you need is like one or five or 10

1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:36.800
 really good algebra teachers,

1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:39.800
 and they need to do it a billion times a day

1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:42.800
 or a billion times a year for free.

1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:45.800
 And if we do that,

1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:49.800
 there's no reason why you can't give infinite education,

1:14:49.800 --> 1:14:53.800
 certainly in science, technology, engineering, and math, right?

1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:59.800
 Infinite education to everybody with no constraint.

1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:01.800
 And I think the same is true, right,

1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:03.800
 with just about every other thing.

1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:06.800
 If you want to bring joy to the world,

1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:08.800
 you need digital music.

1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:11.800
 If you want to bring, you know, enlightenment to the world,

1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:13.800
 you need digital education.

1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:17.800
 If you, you know, want to bring anything of consequence

1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:20.800
 in the world, you got to digitally transform it,

1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:23.800
 you got to manufacture it something like

1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:26.800
 100 times more efficiently as a start,

1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:29.800
 but a million times more efficiently

1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:34.800
 is probably, you know, that's hopeful.

1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:36.800
 Maybe you have a chance.

1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:39.800
 If you look at all of these space endeavors

1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:41.800
 and everything we're thinking about getting to Mars,

1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:43.800
 getting off the planet, getting to other worlds,

1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:45.800
 number one thing you got to do

1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:49.800
 is you got to make a fundamental breakthrough in an engine.

1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:52.800
 People dreamed about flying for thousands of years,

1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:55.800
 but until the internal combustion engine,

1:15:55.800 --> 1:15:59.800
 you didn't have enough, you know, enough energy,

1:15:59.800 --> 1:16:02.800
 enough power in a light enough package

1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:05.800
 in order to solve the problem.

1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:11.800
 And the human race has all sorts of those fundamental engines

1:16:11.800 --> 1:16:16.800
 and materials and techniques that we need to master.

1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:20.800
 And each one of them is a lifetime of experimentation

1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:25.800
 of someone capable of making a seminal contribution

1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:27.800
 to the body of human knowledge.

1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:29.800
 There are certain problems like education

1:16:29.800 --> 1:16:32.800
 that could be solved through this process of dematerialization.

1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:38.800
 And by the way, to give props to the 500k algebra teachers,

1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:40.800
 when I look at YouTube, for example,

1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:44.800
 one possible approach is each one of those 500,000 teachers

1:16:44.800 --> 1:16:47.800
 probably had days and moments of brilliance

1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:50.800
 and if they had the ability to contribute to

1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:52.800
 in the natural selection process,

1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:56.800
 like the market of education where the best ones rise up,

1:16:56.800 --> 1:16:58.800
 that's a really interesting way,

1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:02.800
 which is like the best day of your life,

1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:05.800
 the best lesson you've ever taught

1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:13.800
 could be found and sort of broadcast to billions of people.

1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:18.800
 So all of those kinds of ideas can be made real in the digital world.

1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:20.800
 Now traveling across planets,

1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:26.800
 you still can't solve that problem with dematerialization.

1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:30.800
 What you could solve potentially is dematerializing the human brain

1:17:30.800 --> 1:17:35.800
 where you can transfer, like you don't need to have astronauts on the ship.

1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:40.800
 You can have a floppy disk carrying a human brain.

1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:44.800
 Touching on those points, you'd love for the 500,000 algebra teachers

1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:47.800
 to become 500,000 math specialists

1:17:47.800 --> 1:17:51.800
 and maybe they comp into 50,000 specialties as teams

1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:54.800
 and they all pursue 50,000 new problems

1:17:54.800 --> 1:17:56.800
 and they put their algebra teaching on autopilot.

1:17:56.800 --> 1:18:01.800
 That's the same as when I give you 11 cents worth of electricity

1:18:01.800 --> 1:18:07.800
 and you don't have to row about eight hours a day

1:18:07.800 --> 1:18:09.800
 before you can eat.

1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:11.800
 It would be a lot better, you know,

1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:15.800
 that you would pay for your food in the first eight seconds of your day

1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.800
 and then you could start thinking about other things, right?

1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:23.800
 With regard to technology, you know,

1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:27.800
 one thing that I learned studying technology when you look at S curves

1:18:27.800 --> 1:18:31.800
 is until you start the S curve,

1:18:31.800 --> 1:18:36.800
 you don't know whether you're 100 years from viability,

1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:41.800
 1,000 years from viability, or a few months from viability.

1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:45.800
 Isn't that fun? That's so fun.

1:18:45.800 --> 1:18:49.800
 The early part of the S curve is so fun because you don't know.

1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:54.800
 In 1900, you could have got any number of learned academics

1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:58.800
 to give you 10,000 reasons why humans will never fly, right?

1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:00.800
 And in 1903, the Wright brothers flew

1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:03.800
 and by 1969, we're walking on the moon.

1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:09.800
 So the advance that we made in that field was extraordinary,

1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:12.800
 but for the 100 years and 200 years before,

1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:15.800
 they were just back and forth and nobody was close.

1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:18.800
 And that's the happy part.

1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:23.800
 The happy part is we went from flying 20 miles an hour or whatever

1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:29.800
 to flying 25,000 miles an hour in 66 years.

1:19:29.800 --> 1:19:35.800
 The unhappy part is I studied aeronautical engineering at MIT in the 80s.

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:38.800
 And in the 80s, we had Gulfstream aircraft.

1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:40.800
 We had Boeing 737s.

1:19:40.800 --> 1:19:45.800
 We had the space shuttle and you fast forward 40 years

1:19:45.800 --> 1:19:49.800
 and we pretty much had the same exact aircraft.

1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:55.800
 The efficiency of the engines was 20, 30% more.

1:19:55.800 --> 1:20:01.800
 We slammed into a brick wall around 69 to 75.

1:20:01.800 --> 1:20:06.800
 In fact, the global express, the Gulfstream,

1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:11.800
 these were all engineered in the 70s, some in the 60s.

1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:17.800
 The actual fuselage silhouette of a Gulfstream of a G5

1:20:17.800 --> 1:20:20.800
 was the same shape as a G4, is the same shape as a G3,

1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:22.800
 is the same shape as a G2.

1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:25.800
 And that's because they were afraid to change the shape for 40 years

1:20:25.800 --> 1:20:27.800
 because they worked it out in a wind tunnel.

1:20:27.800 --> 1:20:29.800
 I knew it worked.

1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:32.800
 And when they finally decided to change the shape,

1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:36.800
 it was like a $10 billion exercise with modern supercomputers

1:20:36.800 --> 1:20:40.800
 and computational fluid dynamics.

1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:42.800
 Why was this so hard?

1:20:42.800 --> 1:20:46.800
 What is that wall made of that you slammed into?

1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:47.800
 The right question is,

1:20:47.800 --> 1:20:50.800
 so why does a guy that went to MIT that got an aeronautical engineering degree

1:20:50.800 --> 1:20:52.800
 spend his career in software?

1:20:52.800 --> 1:20:55.800
 Why is it that I never, a day in my life,

1:20:55.800 --> 1:20:58.800
 with the exception of some Air Force reserve work,

1:20:58.800 --> 1:21:00.800
 I never got paid to be an aeronautical engineer

1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:03.800
 and I worked in software engineering my entire career?

1:21:03.800 --> 1:21:06.800
 Maybe software engineering is the new aeronautical engineering

1:21:06.800 --> 1:21:08.800
 in some way.

1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:11.800
 Maybe you hit fundamental walls in certain

1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:16.800
 until you have to return to it centuries later.

1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:21.800
 The National Gallery of Art was endowed by a very rich man,

1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:23.800
 Andrew Mellon.

1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:25.800
 And you know how he made his money?

1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:27.800
 Aluminum.

1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:29.800
 Okay?

1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:34.800
 And you know what kind of airplanes you can create without aluminum?

1:21:34.800 --> 1:21:36.800
 Nothing.

1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:38.800
 Nothing, right?

1:21:38.800 --> 1:21:40.800
 So some materials problem.

1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:44.800
 Okay, so 1900, we made massive advances in metallurgy, right?

1:21:44.800 --> 1:21:46.800
 I mean, that was US steel.

1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:49.800
 That was iron to steel, aluminum.

1:21:49.800 --> 1:21:53.800
 Massive fortunes were created because this was a massive technical advance.

1:21:53.800 --> 1:21:56.800
 And then we also had the internal combustion engine

1:21:56.800 --> 1:21:59.800
 and you know, the story of Ford and General Motors

1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:03.800
 and Daimler Chrysler and the like is informed by that.

1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:06.800
 So you have no jet engines, no rocket motors,

1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:09.800
 no internal combustion engines, you have no aviation.

1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:11.800
 But even if you had those engines,

1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:15.800
 if you were trying to build those things with steel, no chance.

1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:17.800
 You had to have aluminum.

1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:22.800
 So there's like two pretty basic technologies.

1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:26.800
 And once you have those two technologies, stuff happens very fast.

1:22:26.800 --> 1:22:33.800
 So tell me the last big advance in like jet engines.

1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:35.800
 There hasn't been one.

1:22:35.800 --> 1:22:39.800
 Like the last big advance in rocket engines, hasn't been one.

1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:43.800
 The big advances in spaceship design from what I can see

1:22:43.800 --> 1:22:48.800
 are in the control systems, the gyros and the ability to land, right?

1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:50.800
 In a stable fashion.

1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:52.800
 That's pretty amazing landing a rocket.

1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:57.800
 Also in the, at least according to Elon and so on,

1:22:57.800 --> 1:23:02.800
 the manufacture of the more efficient

1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:05.800
 and less expensive manufacturer of rockets.

1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:09.800
 So like it's a production, whatever that you call that discipline of

1:23:09.800 --> 1:23:12.800
 at scale manufacturer at scale production, so factory work.

1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:14.800
 But it's not 10X.

1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:17.800
 I mean, maybe it's 10X over a period of a few decades.

1:23:17.800 --> 1:23:22.800
 When we figure out how to operate a spaceship, you know,

1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:26.800
 on the water in your water bottle for a year, right?

1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:28.800
 Now, then you've got a breakthrough.

1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:33.800
 So the bottom line is propulsion, propulsion technology,

1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:36.800
 propellants and the materials technology.

1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:40.800
 They were critical to getting on that aviation S curve.

1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:43.800
 And then we slammed into a wall in the 70s.

1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:49.800
 And the Boeing 747, the Global Express, the Gulf Stream,

1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:51.800
 these things were the space shuttle.

1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:54.800
 They were all pretty much reflective of that.

1:23:54.800 --> 1:23:56.800
 And then we kind of, then we stopped.

1:23:56.800 --> 1:23:58.800
 And at that point, you have to switch to a new S curve.

1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:04.800
 So the next equivalent to the internal combustion engine was the CPU

1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:07.800
 and the next aluminum equivalent was silicon.

1:24:07.800 --> 1:24:10.800
 So when we actually started developing CPUs,

1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:12.800
 the transistor gave way to CPUs.

1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:16.800
 And if you look at the power, right,

1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:20.800
 the bandwidth that we had on computers and Moore's law, right?

1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:27.800
 What if the efficiency of jet engines had doubled every three years?

1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:30.800
 Right, in the last 40 years, where we'd be right now, right?

1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:35.800
 So I think that if you're a business person,

1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:41.800
 if you're looking for a commercially viable application of your mind,

1:24:41.800 --> 1:24:43.800
 then you have to find that S curve.

1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:49.800
 And ideally, you have to find it in the first five, six, 10 years.

1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:52.800
 But people always miss this.

1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:55.800
 Let's say Google Glass, right?

1:24:55.800 --> 1:25:00.800
 Google Glass was an idea 2013, the year is 2022,

1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:03.800
 and people were quite sure this was going to be a big thing.

1:25:03.800 --> 1:25:06.800
 And it could have been at the beginning of the S curve.

1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:11.800
 But fundamentally, we didn't really have an effective mechanism.

1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:13.800
 I mean, people getting vertigo in there.

1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:16.800
 But you didn't know that at the beginning of the S curve, right?

1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:20.800
 I mean, maybe some people had a deep intuition about the fundamentals

1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:23.800
 of augmented reality, but you don't know that.

1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:26.800
 You're looking through the fog.

1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:27.800
 You don't know.

1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:31.800
 So the point is, we're year zero in 2013,

1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:36.800
 and we're still year zero in 2022 on that augmented reality.

1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:39.800
 And when somebody puts out a set of glasses

1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:45.800
 that you can wear comfortably without getting vertigo, right?

1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:49.800
 Without any disorientation that managed to have the stability

1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:52.800
 and the bandwidth necessary to sync with the real world,

1:25:52.800 --> 1:25:54.800
 you'll be in year one.

1:25:54.800 --> 1:25:57.800
 And from that point, you'll have a 70 year

1:25:57.800 --> 1:26:03.800
 or some interesting future until you slam into a limit to growth.

1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:05.800
 And then it'll slow down.

1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:09.800
 And this is the story of a lot of things, right?

1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:14.800
 I mean, John D. Rockefeller got in the oil business in the 1860s,

1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:18.800
 and the oil business, as we understood it,

1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:24.800
 became fairly mature by the 1920s to 30s.

1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:27.800
 And then it actually stayed that way until we got to fracking,

1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:31.800
 which was like 70 years later, and then it burst forward.

1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:34.800
 So the interesting story about Moore's Law, though,

1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:40.800
 is that you get this constant burst of escars on top of escars on top of escars.

1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:43.800
 It's like the moment you start slowing down

1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:46.800
 or almost ahead of you slowing down,

1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:49.800
 you come up with another innovation, another innovation.

1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:55.800
 So Moore's Law doesn't seem to happen in every technological advancement.

1:26:55.800 --> 1:27:00.800
 It seems like you only get a couple of escars, and then you're done for a bit.

1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:03.800
 So I wonder what the pressures there are that resulted in such success

1:27:03.800 --> 1:27:06.800
 over several decades that's still going.

1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:12.800
 Humility dictates that nobody knows when the escarge kicks off

1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:17.800
 and you could be 20 years early or 100 years early.

1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:21.800
 Leonardo da Vinci, you know, they were Michelangelo,

1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:25.800
 they were designing flying machines hundreds and hundreds of years ago.

1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:30.800
 So humility says you're not quite sure when you really hit that commercial viability,

1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:33.800
 and it also dictates, you don't know when it ends.

1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:36.800
 Like when will the party stop?

1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:39.800
 When will Moore's Law stop and we'll get to the point

1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:44.800
 where they're exponentially diminishing returns on silicon performance.

1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:51.800
 And just like we got exponentially diminishing returns on jet engines, you know,

1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:56.800
 and it just takes an exponential increase in effort to make it 10% better.

1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:00.800
 But while you're in the middle of it, then you know you can do things.

1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:04.800
 So the reason that the digital revolution is so important

1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:11.800
 is because the underlying platforms, the bandwidth and the performance of the components,

1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:18.800
 and I said the components are the radio protocols, mobile protocols,

1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:25.800
 the batteries, the CPUs, and the displays, right?

1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:27.800
 Those four components are pretty critical.

1:28:27.800 --> 1:28:30.800
 They're all critical in the creation of an iPhone.

1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:37.800
 I wrote about it in the book, The Mobile Wave, and they catalyzed this entire mobile revolution.

1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:42.800
 Because they have advanced and continue to advance,

1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:48.800
 they created a very fertile environment for all these digital transformations.

1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:57.800
 And the digital transformations themselves, right, they call for creativity in their own, right?

1:28:57.800 --> 1:29:03.800
 Like, I think the interesting thing about, let's take digital maps, right?

1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:07.800
 When you conceptualize something as a dematerialized map, right,

1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:13.800
 it becomes a map because I can put it on a display, like an iPad,

1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:16.800
 or I can put it in a car, like a Tesla.

1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:20.800
 But if you really want to figure it out, you can't think like an engineer,

1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:23.800
 you need to think like a fantasy writer.

1:29:23.800 --> 1:29:28.800
 Like, this is where it's useful if you studied, if you played Dungeons & Dragons,

1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:32.800
 and you read Lord of the Rings, and you studied all the fantasy literature,

1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:42.800
 because when I dematerialize the map, first I put 10 million pages of satellite imagery into the map, right?

1:29:42.800 --> 1:29:46.800
 That's a simple physical transform.

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:50.800
 But then I start to put telemetry into the map,

1:29:50.800 --> 1:29:53.800
 and I keep track of the traffic rates on the roads,

1:29:53.800 --> 1:29:56.800
 and I tell you whether you're being a traffic jam if you drive that way,

1:29:56.800 --> 1:30:00.800
 and I tell you which way to drive, and then I start to get feedback on where you're going,

1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:04.800
 and I tell you the restaurants close, and people don't like it anyway.

1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:08.800
 And then I put an AI on top of it, and I have it drive your car for you.

1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:14.800
 And eventually, the implication of digital transformation of maps is,

1:30:14.800 --> 1:30:19.800
 I get in a self driving car, and I say, take me someplace cool where I can eat.

1:30:19.800 --> 1:30:23.800
 And how did you get to that last step, right?

1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:26.800
 It wasn't simple engineering.

1:30:26.800 --> 1:30:29.800
 There's a bit of fantasy in there, a bit of magic.

1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:32.800
 Design, art, whatever the heck you call it.

1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:37.800
 It's whatever, yeah, fantasy injects magic into the engineering process.

1:30:37.800 --> 1:30:45.800
 Imagination precedes great revolutions in engineering.

1:30:45.800 --> 1:30:50.800
 It's like imagining a world of what you can do with the display.

1:30:50.800 --> 1:30:52.800
 How will the interaction be?

1:30:52.800 --> 1:30:55.800
 That's where Google Glass actually came in, augmented reality, virtual reality.

1:30:55.800 --> 1:30:59.800
 People were playing in the space of sci fi imagination.

1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:01.800
 They called a moan shot. They tried.

1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:04.800
 It didn't work, but to their credit, they stopped trying, right?

1:31:04.800 --> 1:31:06.800
 Oh, and then there's new people. They keep dreaming.

1:31:06.800 --> 1:31:08.800
 Dreamers are all around us.

1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:12.800
 I love those dreamers, and most of them fail and suffer because of it,

1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:17.800
 but some of them win Nobel Prizes or become billionaires.

1:31:17.800 --> 1:31:25.800
 Well, what I would say is if half the civilization dropped what they were doing tomorrow

1:31:25.800 --> 1:31:33.800
 and eagerly started working on launching a rocket to Alpha Centauri,

1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:37.800
 it might not be the best use of our resources

1:31:37.800 --> 1:31:45.800
 because it's kind of like if half of Athens in the year 500 BC eagerly started working on flying machines.

1:31:45.800 --> 1:31:49.800
 If you went back and you said, what advice would you give them?

1:31:49.800 --> 1:31:52.800
 You would say, it's not going to work until you get to aluminum,

1:31:52.800 --> 1:31:57.800
 and you're not going to get to aluminum until you work out the steel and certain other things,

1:31:57.800 --> 1:32:02.800
 and you're not going to get to that until you work out the calculus of variations and some metallurgy.

1:32:02.800 --> 1:32:05.800
 There's a dude, Newton, that won't come along for quite a while,

1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:09.800
 and he's going to give you the calculus to do it, and until then, it's hopeless.

1:32:09.800 --> 1:32:16.800
 So you might be better off to work on the aqueduct or to focus upon sales or something.

1:32:16.800 --> 1:32:25.800
 So if I look at this today, I say there's massive profound civilization advances to be made

1:32:25.800 --> 1:32:29.800
 through digital transformation of information, and you can see them like that.

1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:35.800
 This is not the story of today, right? It's 10 years old, what we've been seeing.

1:32:35.800 --> 1:32:39.800
 We're living through different manifestations of that story today, too, though.

1:32:39.800 --> 1:32:44.800
 Like social media, the effects of that is very interesting

1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:47.800
 because ideas spread even, you talk about velocity of money.

1:32:47.800 --> 1:32:51.800
 The velocity of ideas keeps increasing.

1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:56.800
 So Wikipedia is a passive store, it's a store of knowledge.

1:32:56.800 --> 1:33:02.800
 Twitter is like a water hose or something.

1:33:02.800 --> 1:33:05.800
 It's like spraying you with knowledge whether you want it or not.

1:33:05.800 --> 1:33:11.800
 It's like social media is just like this explosion of ideas, and then we pick them up,

1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:17.800
 and then we try to understand ourselves because the drama of it also plays with our human psyche.

1:33:17.800 --> 1:33:22.800
 So sometimes there's more ability for misinformation, for propaganda to take hold,

1:33:22.800 --> 1:33:24.800
 so we get to learn about ourselves.

1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:28.800
 We get to learn about the technology that can decelerate the propaganda, for example,

1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:30.800
 all that kind of stuff.

1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:36.800
 But the reality is, I feel like we're living through a singularity in the digital information space,

1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:43.800
 and we don't have a great understanding of exactly how it's transforming our lives.

1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:47.800
 This is where money is useful as a metaphor for significance

1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:54.800
 because if money is the economic energy of the civilization,

1:33:54.800 --> 1:34:01.800
 then something that's extraordinarily lucrative that's going to generate a monetary or a wealth increase

1:34:01.800 --> 1:34:04.800
 is a way to increase the net energy in the civilization.

1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:08.800
 And ultimately, if we had ten times as much of everything,

1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:16.800
 we'd have a lot more free resources to pursue all of our advanced scientific and mathematical and theoretical endeavors.

1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:18.800
 So let's take Twitter.

1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:22.800
 Twitter is something that could be ten times more valuable than it is.

1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:26.800
 Twitter could be made ten times better.

1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:30.800
 Oh, by the way, I should say that people should follow you on Twitter. Your Twitter account is awesome.

1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:31.800
 Thank you.

1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:33.800
 It could be made ten times better, yeah.

1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:35.800
 Yeah, Twitter can be made ten times better.

1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:44.800
 If we take YouTube or take education, we could generate a billion PhDs.

1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:51.800
 And the question is, do you need any profound breakthrough in materials or technology to do that?

1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:53.800
 Yeah, it's not really.

1:34:53.800 --> 1:35:02.800
 So if you want to, you could make Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter, all these things better.

1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:08.800
 The United States government, if they took 1% of the money they spend on the Department of Education

1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:18.800
 and they simply poured it into digital education and they gave degrees to people that actually met those requirements,

1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:26.800
 they could provide 100x as much education for one one hundredth of the cost and they could do it with no new technology.

1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:30.800
 That's a marketing and political challenge.

1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:35.800
 So I don't think every objective is equally practical.

1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:48.800
 And I think the benefit of being an engineer or thinking about practical achievements is when the government pursues an impractical objective

1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:54.800
 or when anybody, an entrepreneur, not so bad with an entrepreneur because they don't have that much money to waste.

1:35:54.800 --> 1:36:01.800
 When a government pursues an impractical objective, they squander trillions and trillions of dollars and achieve nothing.

1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:10.800
 Whereas if they pursue a practical objective or if they simply get out of the way and do nothing

1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:19.800
 and they allow the free market to pursue the practical objectives, then I think you can have profound impact on the human civilization.

1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:35.800
 And if I look at the world we're in today, I think that there are multi trillion, 10, 20, 50 trillion dollars worth of opportunities

1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:41.800
 in the digital information realm yet to be obtained.

1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:51.800
 But there's hundreds of trillions of dollars of opportunities in the digital energy realm that not only are they not obtained.

1:36:51.800 --> 1:36:55.800
 The majority of people don't even know what digital energy is.

1:36:55.800 --> 1:36:57.800
 Most of them reject the concept.

1:36:57.800 --> 1:36:59.800
 They're not looking for it.

1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:01.800
 They're not expecting to find it.

1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:04.800
 It's inconceivable because it is a paradigm shift.

1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:09.800
 But in fact, it's completely practical right under our nose.

1:37:09.800 --> 1:37:18.800
 It's staring at us and it could make the entire civilization work dramatically better in every respect.

1:37:18.800 --> 1:37:24.800
 So you mentioned in the digital world, digital information is one.

1:37:24.800 --> 1:37:35.800
 Digital energy is two and the possible impact on the world and the set of opportunities available in the digital energy space is much greater.

1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:40.800
 So how do you think about the digital energy? What is it?

1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:42.800
 So I'll start with Tesla.

1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:44.800
 He had a very famous quote.

1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:51.800
 He said, if you want to understand the universe, think in terms of energy, vibration and frequency.

1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:54.800
 And it gets you thinking about what is the universe?

1:37:54.800 --> 1:37:57.800
 And of course the universe is just all energy.

1:37:57.800 --> 1:37:59.800
 And then what does matter?

1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:02.800
 Matter is low frequency energy.

1:38:02.800 --> 1:38:05.800
 And what are we?

1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:09.800
 We're vibrating from ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:12.800
 I can turn a tree into light.

1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:15.800
 I can turn light back into a tree.

1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:21.800
 If I consider the entire universe and it's very important because we don't really think this way.

1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:25.800
 Let's take the New York disco model.

1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:34.800
 If I walk into a nightclub and there's loud music blaring in New York City, what's really going on there?

1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:40.800
 If you blast out 14 billion years ago, the universe is formed.

1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:43.800
 That's a low frequency thing, the universe.

1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:48.800
 Four and a billion years ago, the sun, maybe the earth are formed.

1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:55.800
 The continents are 400 million years old, the schist that New York City is on is some hundreds of millions of years.

1:38:55.800 --> 1:38:58.800
 But the Hudson River is only 20,000 years.

1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:02.800
 There's a building that's probably 50 years old.

1:39:02.800 --> 1:39:08.800
 There's a company operating that disco or that club, which is five to 10 years old.

1:39:08.800 --> 1:39:13.800
 There's a person, a customer walking in there for an experience for a few hours.

1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:20.800
 There's music that's oscillating at some kilohertz and then there's light.

1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:29.800
 And you have all forms of energy, all frequencies, all layered, all moving through different medium.

1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:36.800
 And how you perceive the world is a question of at what frequency do you want to perceive the world?

1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:47.800
 And I think that once you start to think that way, you're catalyzed to think about what would digital energy look like

1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:53.800
 and why would I want it and what is it?

1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:56.800
 So why don't we just start right there?

1:39:56.800 --> 1:39:57.800
 What is it?

1:39:57.800 --> 1:40:01.800
 The most famous manifestation of digital energy is Bitcoin.

1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:04.800
 Bitcoin is a crypto asset.

1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:07.800
 It's a crypto asset that has monetary value.

1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:09.800
 Can we just link on that?

1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:17.800
 Bitcoin is a digital asset that has monetary value.

1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:19.800
 What is a digital asset?

1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:20.800
 What is monetary?

1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:25.800
 Why use those terms versus the words of money and currency?

1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:29.800
 Is there something interesting in that disambiguation of different terms?

1:40:29.800 --> 1:40:32.800
 I'd call it a crypto asset network.

1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:41.800
 The goal is to create a billion dollar block of pure energy in cyberspace.

1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:48.800
 One that I could then move with no friction at the speed of light.

1:40:48.800 --> 1:40:53.800
 It's the equivalent of putting a million pounds in orbit.

1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:58.800
 How do I actually launch something into orbit?

1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:03.800
 How do I launch something into cyberspace such that it moves friction free?

1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:09.800
 And the solution is a decentralized proof of work network.

1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:16.800
 Satoshi's solution was I'm going to establish protocol running on a distributed set of computers

1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:22.800
 that will maintain a constant supply of never more than 21 million Bitcoins

1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:30.800
 that are subdividable by 100 million Satoshi's, each transferable via transferring private keys.

1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:44.800
 Now, the innovation is to create that in a ethical, durable fashion.

1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:49.800
 The ethical innovation is I want it to be property and not a security.

1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:58.800
 A bushel of corn, an acre of land, a stack of lumber, and a bar of gold, and a Bitcoin are all property.

1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:03.800
 And that means they're all commonly occurring elements in the world.

1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:08.800
 You could call them commodities, but commodity is a little bit misleading, and I'll tell you in a second.

1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:15.800
 But they're all distinguished by the fact that no one entity or person or government controls them.

1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:23.800
 If you have a barrel of oil and you're in Ukraine versus Russia versus Saudi Arabia versus the U.S.,

1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:27.800
 you have a barrel of oil, right?

1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:35.800
 And it doesn't matter what the premier in Japan or the mayor of Miami Beach thinks about your barrel of oil.

1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:42.800
 They cannot wave their hand and make it not a barrel of oil or a quart of wood, right?

1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:48.800
 And so property is just a naturally occurring element in the universe, right?

1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:50.800
 Why use the word ethical?

1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:53.800
 Sorry, I may interrupt occasionally.

1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:57.800
 Why ethical assigned to property?

1:42:57.800 --> 1:43:08.800
 Because if it's a security, a security would be an example of a share of a stock or a crypto token controlled by a small team.

1:43:08.800 --> 1:43:21.800
 And in the event that something is a security because some small group or some identifiable group can control its nature, character, supply,

1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:30.800
 then it really only becomes ethical to promote it or sell it pursuant to fair disclosures.

1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:34.800
 So I'll give you maybe practical example.

1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:36.800
 I'm the mayor of Chicago.

1:43:36.800 --> 1:43:38.800
 I give a speech.

1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:49.800
 My speech, I say, I think everybody in Chicago should own their own farm and have chicken, a chicken in the backyard and their own horse and an automobile.

1:43:49.800 --> 1:43:51.800
 That's ethical.

1:43:51.800 --> 1:44:01.800
 I give the same speech and I say, I think everybody in Chicago should buy Twitter stock, sell their house or sell their cash and buy Twitter stock.

1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:03.800
 Is that ethical?

1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:15.800
 Not really. At that point, you've ended into a conflict of interest because what you're doing is you're promoting an asset which is substantially controlled by a small group of people,

1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:18.800
 the board of directors or the CEO of the company.

1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:27.800
 So how would you feel if the president of the United States said, I really think Americans should all buy Apple stock?

1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:33.800
 Especially if you worked at Google, but you worked anywhere, you'd be like, why isn't he saying buy mine?

1:44:33.800 --> 1:44:40.800
 A security is a proprietary asset in some way, shape or form.

1:44:40.800 --> 1:44:49.800
 And the whole nature of securities law, it starts from this ancient idea, they'll shall not lie, cheat or steal.

1:44:49.800 --> 1:45:01.800
 So if I'm going to sell you securities or I'm going to promote securities as a public figure or as an influencer or anybody else,

1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:13.800
 if I create my own Yoyo coin or Mikey coin and then there's a million of them and I tell you that I think that it's a really good thing and Mikey coin will go up forever,

1:45:13.800 --> 1:45:21.800
 everybody buys Mikey coin and then I give 10 million to you and don't tell the public, I've cheated them.

1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:28.800
 Maybe if I have Mikey coin and I think there's only 2 million Mikey coin and I swear to you there's only 2 million

1:45:28.800 --> 1:45:35.800
 and then I get married and I have three kids and my third kid is in the hospital and my kid's going to die

1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:42.800
 and I have this ethical reason to print 500,000 more Mikey coin or else people are going to die and everybody tells me it's fine.

1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:49.800
 I've still abused the investor, right? It's an ethical challenge.

1:45:49.800 --> 1:46:00.800
 If you look at ethics laws everywhere in the world, they all boil down to having a clause which says that if you're a public figure,

1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:07.800
 you can't endorse any security, you can't endorse something that would cause you to have a conflict of interest.

1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:16.800
 So if you're a mayor, a governor, a country, a public figure, an influencer and you want to promote or promulgate

1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:24.800
 or support something using any public influence or funds or resources you may have, it needs to be property.

1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:29.800
 It can't be security. So it goes beyond that, right?

1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:34.800
 I mean like what the Chinese want to support an American company, right?

1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:40.800
 As soon as you look at what's in the best interest of the human race, the civilization,

1:46:40.800 --> 1:46:51.800
 you realize that if you want an ethical path forward, it needs to be based on common property which is fair

1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:57.800
 and the way you get to a common property is through an open permissionless protocol.

1:46:57.800 --> 1:47:05.800
 If it's not open, right, it's proprietary and I know what the code says and you don't know what the code says, that makes it a security.

1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:19.800
 If it's permissioned, if you're not allowed on my network or if you can be censored or booted off my network, that also makes it a security.

1:47:19.800 --> 1:47:32.800
 So when I talk about property, I mean the challenge here is how do I create something that's equivalent to a barrel of oil in cyberspace?

1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:42.800
 And that means it has to be a non sovereign bearer instrument, open permissionless, not censorable, right?

1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:53.800
 If I could do that, then I could deliver you 10,000 dematerialized barrels of oil and you would take settlement of them

1:47:53.800 --> 1:48:04.800
 and you would know that you have possession of that property irregardless of the opinion of any politician or any company or anybody else in the world.

1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:15.800
 That's a really critical characteristic and it actually is, it's probably one of the fundamental things that makes Bitcoin special.

1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:19.800
 Bitcoin isn't just a crypto asset network, it's easy to create a crypto asset network.

1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:37.800
 It's very hard to create an ethical crypto asset network because you have to create one without any government or corporation or investor exercising into influence to make it successful.

1:48:37.800 --> 1:48:50.800
 Open permissionless, non censorable, so basically no way for you without explicitly saying so, outsourcing control to somebody else.

1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:54.800
 So it's a kind of, you have full control.

1:48:54.800 --> 1:49:01.800
 Even with a barrel of oil, what's the difference in between a barrel of oil and a Bitcoin to you?

1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:07.800
 Because you kind of mentioned that both are property.

1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:10.800
 You mentioned Russia and China and so on.

1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:13.800
 Is it the ability of the government to confiscate?

1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:21.800
 In the end, governments can probably confiscate no matter what the asset is, but you want to lessen the effort involved.

1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:27.800
 A barrel of oil is a bucket of physical property, liquid property, and Bitcoin is a digital property.

1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:31.800
 But it's easier to confiscate a barrel of oil.

1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:38.800
 It's easier to confiscate things in the real world than things in cyberspace. Much easier.

1:49:38.800 --> 1:49:49.800
 So that's not universally true. Some things in the digital space are actually easier to confiscate because just the nature of how things move easily with information.

1:49:49.800 --> 1:50:01.800
 I think in the Bitcoin world, what we would say is that Bitcoin is the most difficult property that the human race possesses or has yet invented to confiscate.

1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:06.800
 And that's by virtue of the fact that you could take possession of it by your private keys.

1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:18.800
 So if you got your 12 seed phrases in your head, then that would be the highest form of property right because I literally have to crack your head open and read your mind to take it.

1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:26.800
 It doesn't mean I couldn't extract it from you under duress, but it means that it's harder than every other thing you might own.

1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:29.800
 In fact, it's exponentially harder.

1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:47.800
 If you consider every other thing you might own, a car, a house, a share of stock, gold, diamonds, property rights, intellectual property rights, movie rights, music rights, anything imaginable, they would all be easier by orders and orders of magnitude to seize.

1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:57.800
 So digital property in the form of a set of private keys is by far the apex property of the human race.

1:50:57.800 --> 1:50:59.800
 In terms of ethics, I want to make one more point.

1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:10.800
 It's like, I might say to you, Lex, I think Bitcoin is the best, most secure, most durable crypto asset network in the world is going to go up forever and there's nothing better in the world.

1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:12.800
 I might be right.

1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:14.800
 I might be wrong.

1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:20.800
 But the point is, because it's property, it's ethical for me to say that.

1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:29.800
 If I were to turn around and say, you know, Lex, I think the same about micro strategy stock, MSTR, that's a security, okay?

1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:42.800
 If I'm wrong about that, I have civil liability or other liability because I could go to a board meeting tomorrow and I could actually propose we issue a million more shares of micro strategy stock.

1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:50.800
 Whereas the thing that makes Bitcoin ethical for me to even promote is the knowledge that I can't change it.

1:51:50.800 --> 1:52:00.800
 If I knew that I could make it 42 million instead of 21 million and I had the button back here, right?

1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:04.800
 Then I have a different degree of ethical responsibility.

1:52:04.800 --> 1:52:08.800
 Now, I could tell you your life will be better if you buy Bitcoin and it might not.

1:52:08.800 --> 1:52:15.800
 You might go buy Bitcoin, you might lose the keys and be bankrupt and your life ends and your life is not better because you bought Bitcoin, right?

1:52:15.800 --> 1:52:24.800
 But it wouldn't be my ethical liability any more than if I were to say, Lex, I think you ought to get a farm.

1:52:24.800 --> 1:52:26.800
 I think you should be a farmer.

1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:29.800
 I think a chicken in every pot, you should get a horse.

1:52:29.800 --> 1:52:31.800
 I think you'd be better.

1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:41.800
 These are all opinions expressed about property which may or may not be right that you may or may not agree with.

1:52:41.800 --> 1:52:56.800
 But in a legal sense, if we read the law, if we understand securities law, and I would say most people in the crypto industry, they didn't take companies public and so they're not really focused on the securities law.

1:52:56.800 --> 1:52:58.800
 They don't even know the securities law.

1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:13.800
 If you focus on the securities law, that would say you just can't legally sell this stuff to the general public or promote it without a full set of continuing disclosures signed off on by a regulator.

1:53:13.800 --> 1:53:18.800
 So there's a fairly bright line there with regard to securities.

1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:35.800
 But when you get to the secondary issue, it's how do you actually build a world based on digital property if public figures can't embrace it or endorse it?

1:53:35.800 --> 1:53:52.800
 You see, so you're not going to build a better world based upon Twitter stock if that's your idea of property because Twitter stock is a security and Twitter stock is never going to be a non sovereign bearer instrument in Russia or in China.

1:53:52.800 --> 1:53:54.800
 It's not even legal in China.

1:53:54.800 --> 1:53:57.800
 It's not a global permissionless open thing.

1:53:57.800 --> 1:54:12.800
 It will never be trusted by the rest of the world and legally it's impractical, but would you really want to put $100 trillion worth of economic value on Twitter stock if there's a board of directors and a CEO that could just get up and take half of it tomorrow?

1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:13.800
 The answer is no.

1:54:13.800 --> 1:54:24.800
 So if you want to build a better world based on digital energy, you need to start with constructing a digital property.

1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:38.800
 And I'm using property here in the legal sense, but I would also go to the next step and say property is low frequency money.

1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:48.800
 So if I give you a million dollars and you want to hold it for a decade, you might go buy a house with it, right?

1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:57.800
 And the house is low frequency money. You converted the million dollars of economic energy into a structure called a house.

1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:01.800
 Maybe after a decade, you might convert it back into energy.

1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:08.800
 You might sell the house for currency and it'll be more worth more or less depending upon the monetary climate.

1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:10.800
 The frequency means what here?

1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:13.800
 How quickly it changes state?

1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:16.800
 How quickly does something vibrate?

1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:26.800
 So if I transfer $10 from me to you for a drink and then you turn around and you buy another, right?

1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:29.800
 We're vibrating on a frequency of every few hours, right?

1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:36.800
 The energy is changing hands, but it's not likely that you sell and buy houses every few hours, right?

1:55:36.800 --> 1:55:42.800
 The frequency of a transaction in real estate is every 10 years, every five years.

1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:45.800
 It's a much lower frequency transaction.

1:55:45.800 --> 1:55:57.800
 And so when you think about what's going on here, you have extremely low frequency things which we'll call property.

1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:03.800
 Then you have mid frequency things. I'm going to call them money or currency.

1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:08.800
 And then you have high frequency and that's energy.

1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:14.800
 And that's why I use the illustration of you got the building, you got the light and you got the sound.

1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:18.800
 And they're all just energy moving at different frequencies.

1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:25.800
 Now, Bitcoin is magical and it is truly the innovation.

1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:37.800
 It's like a singularity because it represents the first time in the history of human race that we managed to create a digital property properly understood.

1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:49.800
 It's easy to create something digital, right? Every coupon and every skin on Fortnite and Roblox and Apple TV credits and all these things.

1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:52.800
 They're all digital something, but they're securities, right?

1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:54.800
 Chairs of stock are securities.

1:56:54.800 --> 1:57:03.800
 Whenever anybody transfers, when you transfer money on PayPal or Apple Pay, you're transferring, in essence, a security or an IOU.

1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:15.800
 And so transferring a bearer instrument with final settlement in the internet domain or in cyberspace, that's a critical thing.

1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:20.800
 And anybody in the crypto world can do that. All the cryptos can do that.

1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:27.800
 But what they can't do, what 99% of them fail to do is be property. They're securities.

1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:56.800
 Well, there's a line there I'd like to explore a little further. For example, what about when you, my Coinbase or something like that, when there's an exchange that you buy Bitcoin is in, you start to move away from this kind of some of the aspects that you said makes up a property, which is this nonsensable and permissionless.

1:57:56.800 --> 1:57:58.800
 And open.

1:57:58.800 --> 1:58:12.800
 So in order to achieve the convenience, the effectiveness of the transfer of energy, you have to leverage some of these places that remove the aspects of property.

1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:14.800
 So maybe you can comment on that.

1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:16.800
 Let me give you a good model for that.

1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:31.800
 If you think about the Layer 1 of Bitcoin, the Layer 1 is the property settlement layer and we're going to do 350,000 transactions or less a day, 100 million transactions a year is the bandwidth on the Layer 1.

1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:39.800
 And it would be an ideal Layer 1 to move a billion dollars from point A to point B with the massive security.

1:58:39.800 --> 1:58:43.800
 The role of the Layer 1 is two things.

1:58:43.800 --> 1:58:50.800
 One thing is I want to move a large sum of money through space with security.

1:58:50.800 --> 1:58:58.800
 I can move any amount of Bitcoin in a matter of minutes for dollars on Layer 1.

1:58:58.800 --> 1:59:05.800
 The second important feature of the Layer 1 is I need the money to last forever.

1:59:05.800 --> 1:59:13.800
 I need the money indestructible immortal, so the bigger trick is not to move a billion dollars from here to Tokyo.

1:59:13.800 --> 1:59:18.800
 The big trick is to move a billion dollars from here to the year 2140.

1:59:18.800 --> 1:59:23.800
 And that's what we want to solve with Layer 1.

1:59:23.800 --> 1:59:28.800
 And the best real metaphor in New York City would be the granite or the schist.

1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:36.800
 What you want is a city block of bedrock and how long has it been there? Like millions of years it's been there.

1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:39.800
 And how fast do you want it to move? You don't.

1:59:39.800 --> 1:59:44.800
 In fact, the single thing that's most important is that it not deflect.

1:59:44.800 --> 1:59:48.800
 If it deflects a foot in 100 years, it's too much.

1:59:48.800 --> 1:59:52.800
 If it deflects an inch in 100 years, you might not want that.

1:59:52.800 --> 1:59:58.800
 So the Layer 1 of Bitcoin is a foundation upon which you put weight. How much weight can you put on it?

1:59:58.800 --> 2:00:03.800
 You put a trillion, 10 trillion, 100 trillion, a quadrillion.

2:00:03.800 --> 2:00:07.800
 How much weight is on the bedrock in Manhattan, right?

2:00:07.800 --> 2:00:10.800
 Think about 100 story buildings.

2:00:10.800 --> 2:00:16.800
 The real key there is the foundational asset needs to be there at all.

2:00:16.800 --> 2:00:23.800
 So the fact that you can create a hundred trillion Layer 1 that would stand for 100 years,

2:00:23.800 --> 2:00:27.800
 that is the revolutionary breakthrough first time.

2:00:27.800 --> 2:00:33.800
 And the fact that it's ethical, right? It's ethical and it's common property, global, permissionless.

2:00:33.800 --> 2:00:36.800
 Extremely unlikely that would happen.

2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:39.800
 People tried 50 times before and they all failed.

2:00:39.800 --> 2:00:44.800
 They tried 15,000 times after and they've all been, they've all generally failed.

2:00:44.800 --> 2:00:48.800
 And a couple have like been less successful.

2:00:48.800 --> 2:00:53.800
 But for the most part, that's an extraordinary thing.

2:00:53.800 --> 2:00:56.800
 Now, just really quickly pause, just to define some terms.

2:00:56.800 --> 2:00:58.800
 Maybe people don't know.

2:00:58.800 --> 2:01:09.800
 Layer 1 is that Michael's referring to is in general what people know of as the Bitcoin technology originally defined,

2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:15.800
 which is the blockchain, there's a consensus mechanism of proof of work, a low number of transactions,

2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:21.800
 but you can move a very large amount of money.

2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:27.800
 The reason he's using the term Layer 1 is now that there's a lot of ideas of Layer 2 technologies

2:01:27.800 --> 2:01:33.800
 that are built on top of this bedrock that allow you to move a much larger number of transactions.

2:01:33.800 --> 2:01:40.800
 So, sort of higher frequency, I don't know what terminology you want to use,

2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:48.800
 but basically be able to use now something that is based on Bitcoin to then buy stuff, be a consumer,

2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:53.800
 to transfer money, to use it as currency, just to define some terms.

2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:55.800
 Yeah.

2:01:55.800 --> 2:02:01.800
 So, the Layer 1 is the foundation for the entire cyber economy.

2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:05.800
 And we don't want it to move fast.

2:02:05.800 --> 2:02:14.800
 What we want is immortality, immoral, incorruptible, and destructible.

2:02:14.800 --> 2:02:18.800
 That's what you want, integrity from the Layer 1.

2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:27.800
 Now, there's Layer 2 and Layer 3, and Layer 2 I would define as an open, permissionless, noncostodial protocol

2:02:27.800 --> 2:02:33.800
 that uses the underlying Layer 1 token as its gas fee.

2:02:33.800 --> 2:02:39.800
 So, what's custodial mean, and how does the different markets, like, is lightning network?

2:02:39.800 --> 2:02:43.800
 So, lightning network would be an example of a Layer 2, noncostodial.

2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:48.800
 So, the lightning network will sit on top of Layer 1.

2:02:48.800 --> 2:02:50.800
 It'll sit on top of Bitcoin.

2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:56.800
 And what you want to do is solve the problem of, it's well and fine.

2:02:56.800 --> 2:02:58.800
 I don't want to move a billion dollars every day.

2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:04.800
 What I want to move is five dollars a billion times a day.

2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:07.800
 So, if I want to move five dollars a billion times a day,

2:03:07.800 --> 2:03:15.800
 I don't really need to put the entire trillion dollars of assets at risk every time I move five dollars.

2:03:15.800 --> 2:03:21.800
 All I really need to do is put a hundred thousand dollars in a channel, or a million dollars in a channel.

2:03:21.800 --> 2:03:26.800
 And then I do ten million transactions where I have a million dollars at risk.

2:03:26.800 --> 2:03:28.800
 And of course, it's kind of simple.

2:03:28.800 --> 2:03:35.800
 If I lower my security requirement by a factor of a million,

2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:38.800
 I can probably move the stuff a million times faster.

2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:40.800
 And that's how lightning works.

2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:49.800
 It's noncostodial because there's no corporation or custodian or counterparty you're trusting.

2:03:49.800 --> 2:03:52.800
 There's the risk of moving through the channel.

2:03:52.800 --> 2:04:02.800
 But lightning is an example of how I go from 350,000 transactions a day to 350 million transactions a day.

2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:07.800
 So, on that layer too, you could move the Bitcoin in seconds for fractions of pennies.

2:04:07.800 --> 2:04:14.800
 Now, that's not the end all be all because the truth is there are a lot of open protocols.

2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:16.800
 Lightning probably won't be the only one.

2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:23.800
 There's an open market competition of other permissionless open source protocols to do this work.

2:04:23.800 --> 2:04:33.800
 And in theory, any other crypto network that was deemed to be property, deemed to be non security,

2:04:33.800 --> 2:04:37.800
 you could also think of as potentially a layer two to Bitcoin.

2:04:37.800 --> 2:04:42.800
 There's a debate about are there any and what are they, and we can leave that for a later time.

2:04:42.800 --> 2:04:49.800
 But why do you think of them as layer two as opposed to contending for layer one?

2:04:49.800 --> 2:04:54.800
 Yeah, actually, if they're using their own token, then they are a layer one.

2:04:54.800 --> 2:05:01.800
 If you create an open protocol that uses the Bitcoin token as the fee, then it becomes a layer two.

2:05:01.800 --> 2:05:10.800
 Bitcoin itself incentivizes its own transactions with its own token and that's what makes it layer one.

2:05:10.800 --> 2:05:13.800
 Okay, what's layer three then?

2:05:13.800 --> 2:05:15.800
 Layer three is a custodial layer.

2:05:15.800 --> 2:05:25.800
 So if you want to move Bitcoin in milliseconds for free, you move it through Binance or Coinbase or Cash App.

2:05:25.800 --> 2:05:27.800
 So this is a very straightforward thing.

2:05:27.800 --> 2:05:33.800
 I mean, it seems pretty obvious when you think about it that there are going to be hundreds of thousands of layer threes.

2:05:33.800 --> 2:05:36.800
 There may be dozens of layer twos.

2:05:36.800 --> 2:05:42.800
 I mean, lightning is A1, but it's not the only one. Anybody can invent something, right?

2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:50.800
 And we can have this debate about custodial, noncustodial.

2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:57.800
 Don't you think there's a monopolization possibilities at layer three?

2:05:57.800 --> 2:06:08.800
 So you mentioned Binance, Coinbase, what if they start to dominate and basically everybody's using them practically speaking

2:06:08.800 --> 2:06:15.800
 and then it becomes too costly to memorize the private key in your brain?

2:06:15.800 --> 2:06:19.800
 Or like a cold storage of layer one technology.

2:06:19.800 --> 2:06:30.800
 The idealist fear the layer threes because they think, and especially they detest, there's almost like a layer four, by the way, if you want to.

2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:37.800
 A layer four would be, I've got Bitcoin on an application, but I can't withdraw it.

2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:42.800
 So I've got an application that's backed by Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin is sealed.

2:06:42.800 --> 2:06:44.800
 It's a proprietary example.

2:06:44.800 --> 2:06:45.800
 And I'll give you an example of that.

2:06:45.800 --> 2:06:53.800
 It would be like Grayscale, if I own a share of GBTC, and so I own a security.

2:06:53.800 --> 2:06:56.800
 Actually, you could own MSTR.

2:06:56.800 --> 2:07:07.800
 If you own a security or you own a product that has Bitcoin embedded in it, you get the benefits of Bitcoin, but you don't have the ability to withdraw the asset.

2:07:07.800 --> 2:07:10.800
 To get out of the security market at layer four?

2:07:10.800 --> 2:07:12.800
 Am I understanding this correctly?

2:07:12.800 --> 2:07:28.800
 I don't know if I would say, not all securities are layer four, but anything that's a proprietary product based upon with Bitcoin embedded in it where you can't withdraw the Bitcoin is another application of Bitcoin.

2:07:28.800 --> 2:07:38.800
 So if you think about different ways you can use this, you can either stay completely on the layer one and use the base chain for your transactions.

2:07:38.800 --> 2:07:47.800
 Or you can limit yourself to layer one and layer two lightning, and the purist would say we stay there, get your Bitcoin off the exchange.

2:07:47.800 --> 2:07:50.800
 But you could also go to the layer three.

2:07:50.800 --> 2:07:57.800
 When Cash App supported Bitcoin, they made it very easy to buy it, and then they gave you the bill that would draw.

2:07:57.800 --> 2:08:08.800
 When PayPal or I think Robinhood let you buy it, they wouldn't let you withdraw it and it was a big community uproar, and people want these layer threes to make it possible to withdraw the bitcoins.

2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:13.800
 You can take it to your own private wallet and get it off the exchange.

2:08:13.800 --> 2:08:18.800
 I think the answer to the question of, well, is corruption possible?

2:08:18.800 --> 2:08:35.800
 Corruption is possible in all human institutions and all governments everywhere. The difference between digital property and physical property is when you own a building in Los Angeles and the city politics turn against you, you can't move the building.

2:08:35.800 --> 2:08:49.800
 And when you own a share of a security that's like a US traded security and you wish to move to some other country, you can't take the security with you either.

2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:55.800
 And when you own a bunch of gold and you try to get through the airport, they might not let you take it.

2:08:55.800 --> 2:09:05.800
 So Bitcoin is advantageous versus all those because you actually do have the option to withdraw your asset from the exchange.

2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:22.800
 And if you had Bitcoin with Fidelity and you had shares of stock with Fidelity and if you had bonds and sovereign debt with Fidelity and if you own some mutual funds and some other random limited partnerships with Fidelity,

2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:32.800
 none of those things can be removed from the custodian, but the Bitcoin you can take off the exchange you can remove from the custodian.

2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:44.800
 So there's a deterrent that's an anti corrupting element and the phrase is an armed society is a polite society.

2:09:44.800 --> 2:09:53.800
 Right, because you have the optionality to withdraw all your assets from the crypto exchange, you can enforce fairness.

2:09:53.800 --> 2:10:04.800
 And at the point where you disagree with their policies, you can within an hour move your assets to another counterparty or take personal custody of those assets.

2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:08.800
 And you don't have that option with most other forms of property.

2:10:08.800 --> 2:10:22.800
 You don't have as much optionality with any other form of property on earth. And so what what makes digital property distinct is the fact that it has the most optionality for custody.

2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:31.800
 Now coming back to this digital energy issue, the real key point is the energy moves in milliseconds for free on layer threes.

2:10:31.800 --> 2:10:38.800
 It moves in seconds or less than seconds on layer twos it moves in minutes on the layer one.

2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:52.800
 And I don't think it makes any sense to even think about trying to solve all three problems on the layer one because it's impossible to achieve the security and the incorruptibility and immortality.

2:10:52.800 --> 2:10:57.800
 If you try to build that much speed and that functionality and performance.

2:10:57.800 --> 2:11:05.800
 In fact, if you come back to a New York model, you really wanted a block of granite, a building and a company.

2:11:05.800 --> 2:11:07.800
 That's what makes the economy.

2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:13.800
 Right. If you said if I said to you, you're going to build a building, but you can only have one company in it for the life of the building.

2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:16.800
 It would be very fragile, like very brittle.

2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:20.800
 What company 100 years ago is still relevant today.

2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:25.800
 You want all three layers because they all oscillated different frequencies.

2:11:25.800 --> 2:11:33.800
 And there's a tendency to think, well, it's got to be this L1 or that L1, not really.

2:11:33.800 --> 2:11:37.800
 And sometimes people think, well, I don't really want any L3.

2:11:37.800 --> 2:11:46.800
 But companies, it's not an even or companies are better than crypto asset networks at certain things.

2:11:46.800 --> 2:11:54.800
 If you want complexity, you want to implement complexity or you want to implement compliance or customer service.

2:11:54.800 --> 2:11:57.800
 Companies do these things well.

2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:05.800
 We know you couldn't decentralize Apple or Netflix or even YouTube.

2:12:05.800 --> 2:12:09.800
 The performance wouldn't be there and the subtlety wouldn't be there.

2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:19.800
 And you can't really legally decentralize certain forms of banking and insurance because they will become illegal in the political jurisdiction they're in.

2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:31.800
 So unless you're a crypto anarchist and you believe in no companies and no nation states, which is just not very practical, not any time soon.

2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:44.800
 Once you allow that nation states will continue and companies have a role, then the layered architecture follows and the free market determines who wins.

2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:52.800
 For example, there are layer threes that let you acquire Bitcoin and withdraw Bitcoin.

2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:57.800
 There are other applications that let you acquire but not withdraw it.

2:12:57.800 --> 2:13:03.800
 And they don't get the same market share but they might give you some other advantage.

2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:12.800
 There are certain layer threes like Jack Dorsey's Cash App where they just incorporated lightning and implementation of it.

2:13:12.800 --> 2:13:24.800
 So that makes it advantageous versus an application that doesn't incorporate lightning.

2:13:24.800 --> 2:13:36.800
 If you think about the big picture, the big picture is 8 billion people with mobile phones served by 100 million companies doing billions of transactions an hour.

2:13:36.800 --> 2:13:45.800
 And the companies are settling with each other on the base layer in blocks of 80 million at a time.

2:13:45.800 --> 2:13:55.800
 And then the companies are trading with the consumers in proprietary layers like layer three.

2:13:55.800 --> 2:14:05.800
 And then on occasion people are shuffling assets across custodians with lightning layer two because you don't want to pay $5 to move $50.

2:14:05.800 --> 2:14:09.800
 You want to pay a 20th of a penny to move $50.

2:14:09.800 --> 2:14:15.800
 And so all of these things create efficiency in the economy.

2:14:15.800 --> 2:14:27.800
 And Lex, if you want to consider how much efficiency, if you gave me a billion dollars in 20 years, I couldn't find a way to trade with another company or a counterparty in Nigeria.

2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:31.800
 Like no amount of money.

2:14:31.800 --> 2:14:38.800
 Like $10 billion. I couldn't do it because you get shut down at the banking level.

2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:42.800
 You can't link up a bank in Nigeria with the bank in the U.S.

2:14:42.800 --> 2:14:48.800
 You get shut down at this credit card level because they don't have the credit cards or they won't clear.

2:14:48.800 --> 2:15:03.800
 You get shut down at the compliance FCPA level because you wouldn't be able to implement a system that interfaced with somebody else's system if it's not in the right political jurisdiction.

2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:15.800
 On the other hand, three entrepreneurs in Nigeria on the weekend could create a website that would trade in this lightning economy using open protocols without asking anybody's permission.

2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:23.800
 So you're talking about something that's like a million times cheaper, less friction and faster to do it.

2:15:23.800 --> 2:15:26.800
 If you want to get money to move.

2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:28.800
 What do you think that looks like?

2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:31.800
 So now there's a war going on in Ukraine.

2:15:31.800 --> 2:15:43.800
 There's other wars, Yemen, going out throughout the world in this most difficult of states that a nation can be in, which is at war.

2:15:43.800 --> 2:15:46.800
 Civil war or war with other nations.

2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:51.800
 What's the role of Bitcoin in this context?

2:15:51.800 --> 2:15:58.800
 I mean, Bitcoin is a universal trust protocol, a universal energy protocol, if you will.

2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:00.800
 English is one.

2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:04.800
 What I see is a bunch of fragmentation of applications.

2:16:04.800 --> 2:16:09.800
 For example, the Russian payment app is not going to work in Ukraine.

2:16:09.800 --> 2:16:12.800
 The Ukraine payment app is not going to work in Russia.

2:16:12.800 --> 2:16:18.800
 The U.S. payment apps won't work either of those places, as far as I know.

2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:23.800
 In Argentina, their payment app may not work in certain parts of Africa.

2:16:23.800 --> 2:16:41.800
 So what you have is different local economies where people spin up their own applications, compliant with their own local laws or in war zones, not compliant, but just spinning up.

2:16:41.800 --> 2:16:43.800
 How do you build something that's not compliant?

2:16:43.800 --> 2:16:52.800
 What is the revolutionary act here when you don't agree with the government or what you want to free yourself from the constraints?

2:16:52.800 --> 2:16:54.800
 So here's the thing.

2:16:54.800 --> 2:17:05.800
 When a nation is really at war, especially if it's an authoritarian regime, it's going to try to control the pipe, like lock everything down with the spread of information.

2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:07.800
 How do you break through that?

2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:17.800
 How do you do the thing that you mentioned, which is you have to build another app, essentially, that allows you to flow of money outside the legal constraints placed on you by the government?

2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:20.800
 So basically break the law.

2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:22.800
 Is that possible?

2:17:22.800 --> 2:17:27.800
 Metaphorically speaking, if you want to break out the constraints of your culture, you learn to speak English.

2:17:27.800 --> 2:17:31.800
 For example, it's not illegal to speak English, or even if it is, right?

2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:41.800
 It doesn't matter, but English works everywhere in the world if you can speak it, and then you can tap into a global commerce and intelligence network.

2:17:41.800 --> 2:17:52.800
 So Bitcoin is a language, so you learn to speak Bitcoin or you learn to speak lightning, and then you tap into that network in whatever manner you can.

2:17:52.800 --> 2:17:59.800
 But the problem is it's still very difficult to move Bitcoin around in Russia and Ukraine now during war.

2:17:59.800 --> 2:18:06.800
 There was a sense to me that the cryptocurrency in general could be the savior for helping people.

2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:10.800
 There's millions of refugees that are moving all around.

2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:17.800
 It's very difficult to move money around in that space to help people.

2:18:17.800 --> 2:18:19.800
 I think we're very early.

2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:21.800
 We're very embryonic here.

2:18:21.800 --> 2:18:22.800
 If you look at the...

2:18:22.800 --> 2:18:23.800
 Who's we?

2:18:23.800 --> 2:18:27.800
 Sorry, we as a human civilization, are we operating in the cryptocurrency space?

2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:35.800
 I think the entire crypto economy is very embryonic, and the human race's adoption of it is embryonic.

2:18:35.800 --> 2:18:40.800
 We're like one, two percent down that adoption curve.

2:18:40.800 --> 2:18:47.800
 If you take lightning, for example, the first real commercial applications of lightning are just in the last 12 months.

2:18:47.800 --> 2:18:49.800
 So we're like year one.

2:18:49.800 --> 2:18:55.800
 We might be approaching year two of commercial lightning adoption, and if you look at lightning adoption,

2:18:55.800 --> 2:18:58.800
 lightning's not built into Coinbase.

2:18:58.800 --> 2:19:00.800
 It's not built into Binance.

2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:02.800
 It's not built into FTX.

2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:08.800
 Cash app just implemented the first implementation, but not all the features are built into it.

2:19:08.800 --> 2:19:13.800
 There's a few dozen, a dozen lightning wallets circulating out there.

2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:20.800
 So I think that we're probably going to be 36 months of software development

2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:31.800
 at the point that every Android phone and every iPhone has a Bitcoin wallet or a crypto wallet in it of sorts.

2:19:31.800 --> 2:19:33.800
 That's a big deal.

2:19:33.800 --> 2:19:36.800
 If Apple embraced lightning, that's a big deal.

2:19:36.800 --> 2:19:45.800
 So the adoption is the thing, like in a war zone, adoption, the people who struggle the most in war

2:19:45.800 --> 2:19:50.800
 are people who weren't doing that great before the war started.

2:19:50.800 --> 2:19:52.800
 They don't have the technological sophistication.

2:19:52.800 --> 2:19:55.800
 The hackers and all those kinds of people will find a way.

2:19:55.800 --> 2:20:00.800
 It's just regular people who are just struggling to make day by day living.

2:20:00.800 --> 2:20:10.800
 And so if the adoption permeates the entire culture, then you can start to move money around in the digital space.

2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:16.800
 If you can psychoanalyze Jack Dorsey for a second.

2:20:16.800 --> 2:20:24.800
 So he's one of the early adopters or he's one of the people pushing the early adoption in this Layer 3 inside Cash App.

2:20:24.800 --> 2:20:32.800
 What do you make of the man of this decision as a business owner, as somebody playing in the space?

2:20:32.800 --> 2:20:40.800
 Why did he do it and what does that mean for others at the scale that might be doing the same?

2:20:40.800 --> 2:20:45.800
 So incorporating lightning networking, incorporating Bitcoin into their products.

2:20:45.800 --> 2:20:48.800
 I think he's been pretty clear about this.

2:20:48.800 --> 2:20:58.800
 He feels that Bitcoin is an instrument of economic empowerment for billions of people that are unbanked and have no property rights in the world.

2:20:58.800 --> 2:21:11.800
 If you want to give an incorruptible bank to 8 billion people on the planet,

2:21:11.800 --> 2:21:21.800
 that's the same as asking the question, how do you give a full education through PhD to 8 billion people on the planet?

2:21:21.800 --> 2:21:29.800
 And the answer is a digital version of the 20th century thing running on a mobile phone.

2:21:29.800 --> 2:21:35.800
 And Bitcoin is a bank and cyberspace is run by incorruptible software and it's for everybody on earth.

2:21:35.800 --> 2:21:40.800
 So I think when Jack looks at it, he's very sensitive to the plight of everybody in Africa.

2:21:40.800 --> 2:21:45.800
 If you look at Africans, right, like you're going to give them banks, you're not going to put a bank branch on every corner.

2:21:45.800 --> 2:21:47.800
 That's an obscene waste of energy.

2:21:47.800 --> 2:21:52.800
 You're not going to run copper wires across the continent. That's an obscene waste of energy.

2:21:52.800 --> 2:21:56.800
 You're not going to give them gold.

2:21:56.800 --> 2:22:03.800
 So how are you going to provide people with a decent life?

2:22:03.800 --> 2:22:05.800
 The metaphor I think is relevant here.

2:22:05.800 --> 2:22:09.800
 The biological metaphor lacks is type one diabetic.

2:22:09.800 --> 2:22:12.800
 If you're type one diabetic, you can't form fat.

2:22:12.800 --> 2:22:16.800
 And if you can't form fat, then you can't store excess energy.

2:22:16.800 --> 2:22:20.800
 So that means that, I mean, fat is the ultimate organic battery.

2:22:20.800 --> 2:22:24.800
 And if you've got 30 pounds of it, you can go 60 days without eating.

2:22:24.800 --> 2:22:28.800
 But if you can't generate insulin, you can't form fat cells.

2:22:28.800 --> 2:22:33.800
 And if you can't form fat cells and store energy, then you can eat yourself to death.

2:22:33.800 --> 2:22:35.800
 I mean, you will eat and you will die.

2:22:35.800 --> 2:22:37.800
 You'll starve to death.

2:22:37.800 --> 2:22:42.800
 So the lack of property rights is like being a type one diabetic.

2:22:42.800 --> 2:22:49.800
 And so if you look at most people everywhere in the world, they don't have property rights.

2:22:49.800 --> 2:22:54.800
 They don't have effective bank and their currency is broken.

2:22:54.800 --> 2:23:02.800
 Like what are the two things that in theory would serve as the equivalent of an organic battery

2:23:02.800 --> 2:23:08.800
 or an economic battery to civilization would be, I have a currency which holds its value

2:23:08.800 --> 2:23:10.800
 and I can store it in a bank.

2:23:10.800 --> 2:23:17.800
 So a risk free currency derivative.

2:23:17.800 --> 2:23:19.800
 I pay you your money.

2:23:19.800 --> 2:23:21.800
 You take your life savings.

2:23:21.800 --> 2:23:22.800
 You put it in a bank.

2:23:22.800 --> 2:23:23.800
 You save up for your retirement.

2:23:23.800 --> 2:23:25.800
 You'll have happily ever after.

2:23:25.800 --> 2:23:27.800
 That's the American dream, right?

2:23:27.800 --> 2:23:30.800
 That's the idyllic situation.

2:23:30.800 --> 2:23:33.800
 The real situation is there are no banks.

2:23:33.800 --> 2:23:35.800
 You can't get a bank account.

2:23:35.800 --> 2:23:41.800
 So I give you your pay and currency and then I double the supply and I give it to my cousin

2:23:41.800 --> 2:23:45.800
 or I give it to whatever cause I want or I use it to buy weapons

2:23:45.800 --> 2:23:49.800
 and then you find a loaf of bread cost triple next month is what it costs

2:23:49.800 --> 2:23:52.800
 and your life savings is worthless.

2:23:52.800 --> 2:23:57.800
 And so in that environment, everybody's ripped back to Stone Age barter

2:23:57.800 --> 2:24:03.800
 and the problem with that even Stone Age barter is you're going to carry your life savings on your back

2:24:03.800 --> 2:24:05.800
 and what happens when the guy with the machine gun points it at your head

2:24:05.800 --> 2:24:07.800
 and just takes your life savings.

2:24:07.800 --> 2:24:14.800
 So I think from Jack's point of view, he thinks that life is, this is maybe too strong

2:24:14.800 --> 2:24:21.800
 but these are my words, life is hopeless for a lot of people and Bitcoin is hope.

2:24:21.800 --> 2:24:31.800
 Because it gives everyone an engineered monetary asset that's a bearer instrument

2:24:31.800 --> 2:24:35.800
 and it gives them a bank on their mobile phone

2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:45.800
 and they don't have to trust their government or another counterparty with their life force.

2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:50.800
 So there's a secondary thing I think he's interested in

2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:53.800
 which is the first thing is the human rights issue

2:24:53.800 --> 2:25:03.800
 and the second thing would be the friction to trade cross borders is so great, right?

2:25:03.800 --> 2:25:09.800
 Like, you know, you're like AI, so I'll give you a beautiful notion.

2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:16.800
 Maybe one day there'll be an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace

2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:20.800
 that is self sufficient and rich.

2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:23.800
 Like, it would have sovereignty.

2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:28.800
 Can a robot own money or property?

2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:30.800
 How about kind of Tesla car?

2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:35.800
 Can I actually put enough money in a car for it to drive itself and maintain itself forever?

2:25:35.800 --> 2:25:42.800
 Or can I create an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace that is endowed

2:25:42.800 --> 2:25:47.800
 such that it would live a thousand years and continue to do its job, right?

2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:50.800
 You know, we have a word for that in the real world.

2:25:50.800 --> 2:25:53.800
 It's institution, Harvard, Cambridge, Stanford, right?

2:25:53.800 --> 2:25:58.800
 There are institutions with endowments that go on in perpetuity.

2:25:58.800 --> 2:26:04.800
 But what if I wanted to perpetuate a software program?

2:26:04.800 --> 2:26:12.800
 And with something like digital property with Bitcoin and lightning, you could do it.

2:26:12.800 --> 2:26:21.800
 And on the other hand, with banks and credit cards, you couldn't, right?

2:26:21.800 --> 2:26:22.800
 You couldn't ever.

2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:28.800
 So you can create things that are beautiful and lasting.

2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:31.800
 And what's the difference in speed?

2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:39.800
 Well, so I can either trade with everybody in the world at the speed of light, friction free,

2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:46.800
 in 24 hours writing a Python script, or I can spend a hundred billion dollars to trade

2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:52.800
 with a few million people in the world after it takes them six months of application.

2:26:52.800 --> 2:26:58.800
 The impedance is like a 10 million to one difference, right?

2:26:58.800 --> 2:27:04.800
 And the metaphors are literally like launching something in orbit versus almost orbit

2:27:04.800 --> 2:27:07.800
 or vacuum sealing something.

2:27:07.800 --> 2:27:09.800
 Does it last forever?

2:27:09.800 --> 2:27:10.800
 And does it orbit forever?

2:27:10.800 --> 2:27:13.800
 Or does it go up and come down and burn up?

2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:14.800
 Right?

2:27:14.800 --> 2:27:22.800
 And I think Jack is interested in, you know, putting freedom in orbit, right?

2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:23.800
 Putting freedom in orbit.

2:27:23.800 --> 2:27:24.800
 Putting freedom in orbit.

2:27:24.800 --> 2:27:25.800
 And he said it many times.

2:27:25.800 --> 2:27:30.800
 He said, this is that the internet needs a native currency, right?

2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:36.800
 And no political construct or security can be a native currency.

2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:41.800
 You need a property and you need a property that can be moved a million times a second.

2:27:41.800 --> 2:27:46.800
 Can you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or 100 kilohertz?

2:27:46.800 --> 2:27:54.800
 And the answer is only if it's a pure digital construct, permissionless and open.

2:27:54.800 --> 2:28:01.800
 And so I think he's enthusiastic as the technologist and he's enthusiastic as the humanitarian.

2:28:01.800 --> 2:28:05.800
 And what he's doing is support both those areas.

2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:09.800
 He's supporting the Bitcoin and the lightning protocol by building them into his products.

2:28:09.800 --> 2:28:17.800
 But he's also building the applications, which you need at the cash app level in order to commercialize

2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:20.800
 and deliver the functionality and the compliance necessary.

2:28:20.800 --> 2:28:23.800
 And they're related.

2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:27.800
 And I should also say, he's just a fascinating person.

2:28:27.800 --> 2:28:37.800
 For a random reason that I couldn't even explain if I tried, I met him a few days ago and gave him a great big hug in the middle of nowhere.

2:28:37.800 --> 2:28:39.800
 There was no explanation.

2:28:39.800 --> 2:28:40.800
 He just appeared.

2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:42.800
 That's a fascinating human.

2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:48.800
 His relationship with art, with the world, with human suffering, with technology is fascinating.

2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:55.800
 I don't know what his path looks like, but it's interesting that people like that exist.

2:28:55.800 --> 2:29:02.800
 And in part, I'm saddened that he no longer is involved with Twitter directly as a CEO.

2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:12.800
 Because I was hoping something inside Twitter would also integrate some of these ideas of what you're calling digital energy.

2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:18.800
 To see how social networks, something I'm really interested in and passionate about could be transformed.

2:29:18.800 --> 2:29:21.800
 Let me ask you just for educational purposes.

2:29:21.800 --> 2:29:30.800
 Can you please explain to me what Web3 and the beef between Jack and Mark Andreessen is exactly?

2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:32.800
 Did you see what happened?

2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:41.800
 Sorry to have you analyze Twitter like it's Shakespeare, but can you please explain to me why there was any drama over this topic?

2:29:41.800 --> 2:29:51.800
 First of all, Web3 is a term that's used to refer to the part of the economy that's token finance.

2:29:51.800 --> 2:30:03.800
 So if I'm launching an application and my idea is to create a token along with the application and issue the token to the community so as to finance the application and build support for it.

2:30:03.800 --> 2:30:09.800
 I think that that's the most common interpretation of Web3.

2:30:09.800 --> 2:30:11.800
 There are other interpretations too.

2:30:11.800 --> 2:30:13.800
 So I'm just going to refer to that one.

2:30:13.800 --> 2:30:27.800
 And I think the beef in a nutshell, not articulated, but I'll articulate it is whether or not you should focus all your energy creating applications on top of an ethical digital property like Bitcoin,

2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:39.800
 or whether you should attempt to create a competitor to it, which generally would be deemed as a security by the Bitcoin community.

2:30:39.800 --> 2:30:42.800
 So I'm going to put on my Bitcoin hat here.

2:30:42.800 --> 2:30:47.800
 All the tokens that are, if it's driven by a venture capitalist, well, it's a security.

2:30:47.800 --> 2:30:50.800
 If there's a CEO and a CTO, it's a security.

2:30:50.800 --> 2:30:54.800
 All these projects, they're companies, foundations are companies.

2:30:54.800 --> 2:31:00.800
 If you call them a project or a foundation, it doesn't make it not a security.

2:31:00.800 --> 2:31:07.800
 They're all in essence, collections of individuals that are issuing equity in the form of a token.

2:31:07.800 --> 2:31:27.800
 And if there's a premine, an IPO, an ICO, a foundation or any kind of protocol where there's a group of engineers that have influence over it, then to a securities lawyer,

2:31:27.800 --> 2:31:36.800
 or to most Bitcoiners and definitely to anybody that's steeped in securities law, you're looking to say, well, that passes the Howie test.

2:31:36.800 --> 2:31:39.800
 It looks like a security.

2:31:39.800 --> 2:31:45.800
 It should be sold to the public pursuant to disclosures and regulations.

2:31:45.800 --> 2:31:49.800
 And you're just ducking the IPO process.

2:31:49.800 --> 2:31:53.800
 And so now we get back to the ethical issue.

2:31:53.800 --> 2:32:03.800
 The ethical issue is, if you're trading it as a commodity and representing it as a commodity, while truthfully it's a security,

2:32:03.800 --> 2:32:06.800
 then it's a violation of ethics rules and it's probably illegal.

2:32:06.800 --> 2:32:08.800
 Well, you keep leaning on this.

2:32:08.800 --> 2:32:09.800
 Let me push back on that part.

2:32:09.800 --> 2:32:18.800
 Maybe you can educate me, but you keep leaning on this line of securities law as if it would all do respect to lawyers.

2:32:18.800 --> 2:32:23.800
 As if that line somehow defines what is and isn't ethical.

2:32:23.800 --> 2:32:30.800
 I think there's a lot of correlation as you've discussed, but I'd like to leave the line aside.

2:32:30.800 --> 2:32:37.800
 If the law calls something as a security, it doesn't mean in my eyes that it is unethical.

2:32:37.800 --> 2:32:43.800
 I mean, there could be some technicalities and lawyers and people play games with this kind of stuff all the time.

2:32:43.800 --> 2:32:54.800
 But I take your bigger point that if there's a CEO, there's a project lead that's fundamentally, well, that to you is fundamentally different than the structure of Bitcoin.

2:32:54.800 --> 2:32:56.800
 It's not that creating securities is unethical.

2:32:56.800 --> 2:33:00.800
 I create a security, I took a company public, right?

2:33:00.800 --> 2:33:01.800
 That's not the unethical part.

2:33:01.800 --> 2:33:04.800
 It's completely ethical to create securities.

2:33:04.800 --> 2:33:05.800
 Block is a security.

2:33:05.800 --> 2:33:07.800
 All companies are security.

2:33:07.800 --> 2:33:15.800
 The unethical part is to represent it as property when it's a security and to promote it or trade it as such.

2:33:15.800 --> 2:33:26.800
 This whole promotion, that's also a technical thing because what counts as a not as promotion is a legal thing.

2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:31.800
 And you get in trouble for all these things, but that's the game that lawyers play.

2:33:31.800 --> 2:33:35.800
 There's an ethical thing here, which is like, what's the right to promote a not?

2:33:35.800 --> 2:33:42.800
 To me, propaganda is unethical, but it's usually not illegal.

2:33:42.800 --> 2:33:47.800
 You roll the clock back 20 years, right?

2:33:47.800 --> 2:33:54.800
 All the boiler room pump and dump schemes were all about someone pitching a penny stock, selling Swamplin in Florida.

2:33:54.800 --> 2:34:04.800
 And if you roll the clock back forward 20 years and I create my own company and I represent it as the same thing and I don't make the disclosures, right?

2:34:04.800 --> 2:34:09.800
 You're just one step removed from the boiler room scheme.

2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:12.800
 And that's what's distasteful about it.

2:34:12.800 --> 2:34:17.800
 There are ways to sell securities to the public, but there are expectations.

2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:23.800
 Maybe we could forget about whether the security laws are ethical or not, right?

2:34:23.800 --> 2:34:25.800
 I will leave that alone.

2:34:25.800 --> 2:34:28.800
 We'll just start with the biblical definition of ethics.

2:34:28.800 --> 2:34:30.800
 Don't lie, cheat or steal.

2:34:30.800 --> 2:34:37.800
 So if I'm going to sell something to you, I need to fully disclose what I'm selling to you, right?

2:34:37.800 --> 2:34:44.800
 And that's a matter of great debate right now.

2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:46.800
 So I think that that's part of the debate.

2:34:46.800 --> 2:34:56.800
 But the other part of the debate is whether or not we need more than one token.

2:34:56.800 --> 2:34:58.800
 We need at least one, right?

2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:05.800
 We need at least one digital property because zero means there is no digital economy.

2:35:05.800 --> 2:35:12.800
 And by the way, the conventional view of maximalists is they think there's only one and everything else isn't.

2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:14.800
 That's not the point I'm going to make.

2:35:14.800 --> 2:35:21.800
 I would say we know there is at least one digital property and that is Bitcoin.

2:35:21.800 --> 2:35:39.800
 If you can create a truly decentralized, non custodial, you know, bearer instrument that is not under the control of any organization that is fairly distributed, then you might create another or multiple.

2:35:39.800 --> 2:35:41.800
 And there may be others out there.

2:35:41.800 --> 2:36:01.800
 But I think that the frustration of a lot of people in the Bitcoin community, and I share this with Jack, is we could create $100 trillion of value in the real world simply by building applications on top of Bitcoin as a foundation.

2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:18.800
 And so continually trying to reinvent the wheel and create competitive things is a massive waste of time and its diversion of human creativity.

2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:22.800
 It's like we have an ethical good thing.

2:36:22.800 --> 2:36:27.800
 And now we're going to try to create a third or a fourth one.

2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:28.800
 Why?

2:36:28.800 --> 2:36:31.800
 Well, let's talk about it. So first of all, I'm with you.

2:36:31.800 --> 2:36:36.800
 But let me ask you this interesting question because we talked about properties and securities.

2:36:36.800 --> 2:36:38.800
 Let's talk about conflict of interest.

2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:41.800
 You said you could advertise public.

2:36:41.800 --> 2:36:43.800
 You have a popular Twitter account.

2:36:43.800 --> 2:36:47.800
 It's it's hilarious and insightful.

2:36:47.800 --> 2:36:51.800
 You do promote Bitcoin in a sense.

2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:53.800
 I don't know if you would say that.

2:36:53.800 --> 2:36:59.800
 But do you think there's a conflict of interest in anyone who owns Bitcoin promoting Bitcoin?

2:36:59.800 --> 2:37:03.800
 Is it the same as you promoting the farming?

2:37:03.800 --> 2:37:06.800
 I would say no, there's an interest.

2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:18.800
 I think that I think that you can promote a property or an idea to the extent that you don't control it.

2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:28.800
 I think that the point at which you start to have a conflict of interest is when you're promoting a proprietary product or proprietary security,

2:37:28.800 --> 2:37:31.800
 a security and generalist proprietary asset.

2:37:31.800 --> 2:37:37.800
 So for example, if you look at my Twitter, you will find that I make lots of statements about Bitcoin.

2:37:37.800 --> 2:37:42.800
 You won't ever see me making a statement that say MicroStrategy stock will go forever.

2:37:42.800 --> 2:37:50.800
 I'm not promoting a security MSTR because at the end of the day, MSTR is a security.

2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:51.800
 It is proprietary.

2:37:51.800 --> 2:37:53.800
 I have proprietary interest in it.

2:37:53.800 --> 2:38:00.800
 I have a disproportionate amount of control and influence on the direction.

2:38:00.800 --> 2:38:01.800
 The control is the problem.

2:38:01.800 --> 2:38:05.800
 The control is the problem because you have interest in both.

2:38:05.800 --> 2:38:15.800
 If Bitcoin is as successful as we're talking about, you are very possibly can become the richest human on earth,

2:38:15.800 --> 2:38:18.800
 given how much you own in Bitcoin, right?

2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:20.800
 The wealthiest, not the richest.

2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:21.800
 I don't know what those words mean.

2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:24.800
 I would benefit economically.

2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:25.800
 You would benefit economically.

2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:26.800
 That's true.

2:38:26.800 --> 2:38:37.800
 So the reason that's not conflict of interest is because the word property, that Bitcoin is an idea and Bitcoin is open.

2:38:37.800 --> 2:38:39.800
 It's because I don't own it.

2:38:39.800 --> 2:38:41.800
 I don't control it.

2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:50.800
 In essence, the ethical line here is could I print myself 10 million more Bitcoin or not, right?

2:38:50.800 --> 2:38:52.800
 Or can anyone, right?

2:38:52.800 --> 2:38:53.800
 It's not just you.

2:38:53.800 --> 2:38:55.800
 Can anyone?

2:38:55.800 --> 2:38:57.800
 Can you promote somebody else's?

2:38:57.800 --> 2:38:59.800
 Yes, I guess you can.

2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:04.800
 Can you promote Apple when you have no stake?

2:39:04.800 --> 2:39:11.800
 You could have a Twitter account where you promote oil, or you promote camping, or you promote family values,

2:39:11.800 --> 2:39:17.800
 or promote a carnivore diet, or promote the Iron Man, right?

2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:24.800
 You're not going to get wealthier if you promote camping because you can't own a stake.

2:39:24.800 --> 2:39:25.800
 You own a lot of Bitcoin.

2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:27.800
 What is that?

2:39:27.800 --> 2:39:31.800
 Don't you own a stake in the idea of Bitcoin?

2:39:31.800 --> 2:39:34.800
 Yeah, I would grant you that.

2:39:34.800 --> 2:39:39.800
 But the lack of control is the fundamental ethical line.

2:39:39.800 --> 2:39:42.800
 All you are is you're a fan of the idea.

2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:46.800
 You believe in the idea and the power of the idea.

2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:47.800
 Yeah, I think...

2:39:47.800 --> 2:39:49.800
 You can't take that idea away from others.

2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:50.800
 Let's come back to...

2:39:50.800 --> 2:39:53.800
 Let me give you some maybe easier examples.

2:39:53.800 --> 2:40:01.800
 If you were the head of the Marine Corps, right, and someone came to you and said,

2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:08.800
 I created Marine Coin, and the twist on Marine Coin is I want you to tell every Marine

2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:14.800
 that they'll get an extra Marine Coin when they get their next stripe.

2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:19.800
 And then I'm going to let you buy Marine Coin now, and then after you buy Marine Coin,

2:40:19.800 --> 2:40:25.800
 I want you to promote it to them, right?

2:40:25.800 --> 2:40:32.800
 At some point, if you start to have a disproportionate influence on it, or if you're in a conversation

2:40:32.800 --> 2:40:35.800
 with people with disproportionate influence, it becomes a conflict of interest.

2:40:35.800 --> 2:40:40.800
 And it would make you profoundly uncomfortable, I think, if the head of the Marine Corps

2:40:40.800 --> 2:40:44.800
 started promoting anything that looked like a security.

2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:50.800
 Now, if the head of the Marine Corps started promoting canoeing, you might think he's

2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:52.800
 kind of wacky, like maybe...

2:40:52.800 --> 2:40:57.800
 That's kind of a waste of time at a distraction.

2:40:57.800 --> 2:41:03.800
 But to the extent that canoeing is not a security, not a problem unless you...

2:41:03.800 --> 2:41:08.800
 Ultimately, the issue of decentralization is really a critical...

2:41:08.800 --> 2:41:09.800
 So not having a head.

2:41:09.800 --> 2:41:10.800
 One.

2:41:10.800 --> 2:41:17.800
 Is it something... can Bitcoin be replicated?

2:41:17.800 --> 2:41:22.800
 So all the things that you're saying that make it a property, can that be replicated?

2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:26.800
 I think it's possible to create other crypto properties.

2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:34.800
 Does having a head of a project, a thing that limits its ability to be a property,

2:41:34.800 --> 2:41:38.800
 if you try to replicate a project?

2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:40.800
 Is that the fundamental flaw?

2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:46.800
 Look, I think the real fundamental issue is you just never want it to change.

2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:54.800
 Like if you really want something decentralized, you want a genetic template that substantially

2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:57.800
 is not going to change for a thousand years.

2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:02.800
 So I think Satoshi said at one point, he said the nature of the software is such that

2:42:02.800 --> 2:42:07.800
 by version 0.1, its genetic code was set.

2:42:07.800 --> 2:42:13.800
 If there was any development team that's continually changing it on a routine basis,

2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:19.800
 it becomes harder and harder to maintain its decentralization because now there's the

2:42:19.800 --> 2:42:23.800
 issue of who's influencing the changes.

2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:29.800
 So what you really want is a very, very simple idea.

2:42:29.800 --> 2:42:35.800
 The simplest idea, I'm just going to keep track of who owns 21 million parts of energy.

2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:42.800
 And when someone proposes big functional upgrades, you almost don't really want that development

2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:44.800
 to go on the base layer.

2:42:44.800 --> 2:42:50.800
 You want that development to go on the layer 3s because now Cash App has a proprietary set

2:42:50.800 --> 2:42:53.800
 of functionality and it's a security.

2:42:53.800 --> 2:43:00.800
 And if you're going to promote the use of this thing, you're not going to promote the

2:43:00.800 --> 2:43:06.800
 layer 3 security because that's an edge to a given entity and you're trusting the

2:43:06.800 --> 2:43:13.800
 counterparty, you're going to promote the layer 1 or most the layer 2.

2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:20.800
 Okay, so one of the fascinating things about Bitcoin, and sorry to romanticize certain

2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:26.800
 notions, but Satoshi Nakamoto, that the founder is anonymous, maybe can speak to

2:43:26.800 --> 2:43:32.800
 you whether that's useful, but also I just like the psychology of that to imagine that

2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:36.800
 there's a human being that was able to create something special and walk away.

2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:39.800
 So first, are you Satoshi Nakamoto?

2:43:39.800 --> 2:43:44.800
 I'm certain I'm not.

2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:50.800
 Actually, I think the provenance is really important and if I were to look at the highlighted

2:43:50.800 --> 2:43:56.800
 points, I think having a founder that was anonymous or should anonymous is important.

2:43:56.800 --> 2:43:59.800
 I think the founder disappearing is also important.

2:43:59.800 --> 2:44:04.800
 I think that the fact that the Satoshi coins never moved is also important.

2:44:04.800 --> 2:44:09.800
 I think the lack of an initial coin offering is also important.

2:44:09.800 --> 2:44:13.800
 I think the lack of a corporate sponsor is important.

2:44:13.800 --> 2:44:21.800
 I think the fact that it traded for 15 months with no commercial value was also important.

2:44:21.800 --> 2:44:28.800
 I think that the simplicity of the protocol is very important.

2:44:28.800 --> 2:44:35.800
 I think that the outcome of the block size wars is very important and all of those things

2:44:35.800 --> 2:44:38.800
 add up to common property.

2:44:38.800 --> 2:44:44.800
 They're all indicia indicators of a digital property as opposed to security.

2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:51.800
 If there was a Satoshi sitting around sitting on top of $50 billion worth of Bitcoin,

2:44:51.800 --> 2:45:01.800
 I don't think it would cripple Bitcoin as property, but I think it would undermine its digital property.

2:45:01.800 --> 2:45:07.800
 If I wanted to undermine a crypto asset network, I would do the opposite of all those things.

2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:09.800
 I would launch one myself.

2:45:09.800 --> 2:45:13.800
 I would sell 25% or 50% of the general public.

2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:18.800
 I would keep some of the initial, I would premind some stuff or early mine it, you know,

2:45:18.800 --> 2:45:20.800
 and I would keep an influence on it.

2:45:20.800 --> 2:45:28.800
 Those are all the opposite of what you would do in order to create common property.

2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:38.800
 I see the entire story as Satoshi giving a gift of digital property to the human race and disappearing.

2:45:38.800 --> 2:45:42.800
 Do you think it was one person? Do you have ideas of who it could be?

2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:45.800
 I don't care to speculate.

2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:47.800
 But do you think it was one person?

2:45:47.800 --> 2:45:49.800
 I think it was one person.

2:45:49.800 --> 2:45:51.800
 Maybe in conjunction with a bunch of others.

2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:56.800
 It might have been a group of people that were working together, but certainly there's a Satoshi.

2:45:56.800 --> 2:46:01.800
 It's so fascinating to me that one person could be so brave and thoughtful.

2:46:01.800 --> 2:46:07.800
 Or do you think a lot of it is accident, like the block size wars, the decision to make a block a certain size.

2:46:07.800 --> 2:46:14.800
 All the things you mentioned led up to the characteristics that make Bitcoin property.

2:46:14.800 --> 2:46:18.800
 Do you think that's an accident or it was deeply thought through?

2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:21.800
 This is almost like a history of science question.

2:46:21.800 --> 2:46:23.800
 I think people tried it for, they tried 40 of them.

2:46:23.800 --> 2:46:27.800
 I think there's a history of attempting to create something like this.

2:46:27.800 --> 2:46:31.800
 And it was tried many, many times and they failed for different reasons.

2:46:31.800 --> 2:46:38.800
 And I think that Prometheus tried to start a fire 47 times and maybe the 48th time it sparked.

2:46:38.800 --> 2:46:40.800
 And that's how I see this.

2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:46.800
 This is the first one that sparked and it sets a roadmap for us.

2:46:46.800 --> 2:46:51.800
 And I think if you're looking for any one word that characterizes, it's fair.

2:46:51.800 --> 2:46:57.800
 The whole point of the network is it's a fair launch, a fair distribution.

2:46:57.800 --> 2:47:02.800
 I have Bitcoin, but I bought it.

2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:10.800
 In fact, at this point, we've paid $4 billion of real cash to buy it.

2:47:10.800 --> 2:47:18.800
 If I was sitting on the same position and I had it for free, then there's always this question of,

2:47:18.800 --> 2:47:21.800
 did I, you know, or I bought it for a nickel coin or a penny.

2:47:21.800 --> 2:47:23.800
 The question is, was it fair?

2:47:23.800 --> 2:47:27.800
 And that's a very hard question to answer.

2:47:27.800 --> 2:47:31.800
 Did you acquire the Bitcoin that you own fairly?

2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:36.800
 And if you roll the clock back, you know, you could have bought it for a nickel or a dime,

2:47:36.800 --> 2:47:40.800
 but that was when it was a million times more likely to fail.

2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:44.800
 When the risk was greater, the cost was lower.

2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:49.800
 And then over time, the risk became lower and the cost became greater.

2:47:49.800 --> 2:47:58.800
 And the real critical thing was to allow the marketplace absent any powerful interested actor.

2:47:58.800 --> 2:47:59.800
 Right?

2:47:59.800 --> 2:48:03.800
 It's almost like if Satoshi had held a million coins and then stayed engaged for 10 more years,

2:48:03.800 --> 2:48:08.800
 tweaking things in the background, there's still be that question.

2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:11.800
 But what we've got is really a beautiful thing.

2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:19.800
 We've got a chain reaction in cyberspace or an ideology spreading virally in the world

2:48:19.800 --> 2:48:26.800
 that has seasoned in a fair ethical fashion.

2:48:26.800 --> 2:48:31.800
 Sometimes it's a very violent, brutal fashion with all the volatility, right?

2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:35.800
 And there's been a lot of, you know, a lot of sound and fury along the way.

2:48:35.800 --> 2:48:42.800
 How do you psychoanalyze, how do you deal from a financial, from a human perspective with the volatility?

2:48:42.800 --> 2:48:46.800
 You mentioned you could have gotten it for a nickel and the risk was great.

2:48:46.800 --> 2:48:48.800
 Where's the risk today?

2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:49.800
 What's your sense?

2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:53.800
 You know, we're 13 years into this entire activity.

2:48:53.800 --> 2:48:55.800
 I think the risk has never been lower.

2:48:55.800 --> 2:48:58.800
 If you look at all the risks, right?

2:48:58.800 --> 2:49:04.800
 The risks in the early years are, is the engineering protocol proper?

2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:12.800
 Like one megabyte block size, 10 minute clock frequency, cryptography is first,

2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:15.800
 will it be hacked or will it crash?

2:49:15.800 --> 2:49:18.800
 730,000 blocks and it hasn't crashed.

2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:19.800
 Will it be hacked?

2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:20.800
 Hasn't been hacked.

2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:22.800
 But you know, it's a lindy thing, right?

2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:24.800
 You wait 13 years to see if it'll be hacked.

2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:30.800
 But on the other hand, with a billion dollars, it's not as interesting a target as it is with 100 billion.

2:49:30.800 --> 2:49:33.800
 And when it gets to be worth a trillion, then it's a bigger target.

2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:42.800
 So the risk has been bleeding off over time as the network monetized.

2:49:42.800 --> 2:49:45.800
 I think the second question is, will it be banned?

2:49:45.800 --> 2:49:46.800
 You couldn't know.

2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:50.800
 It literally could have been banned many times early on.

2:49:50.800 --> 2:49:54.800
 In fact, in 2013, I tweeted on the subject, I thought it would be banned.

2:49:54.800 --> 2:49:56.800
 I made a very infamous tweet.

2:49:56.800 --> 2:49:57.800
 Infamous tweet, yeah.

2:49:57.800 --> 2:49:59.800
 I thought it was going to be banned.

2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:05.800
 In 2014, the IRS designated it as property and gave it property tax treatment.

2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:14.800
 Okay, so they could have given it a tax treatment where you had to pay tax on the unrealized capital gains every year

2:50:14.800 --> 2:50:17.800
 and it probably would have crushed it to death, right?

2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:24.800
 So it could have been in any number of places banned by a government,

2:50:24.800 --> 2:50:27.800
 but in fact, it was legitimized as property.

2:50:27.800 --> 2:50:30.800
 And then the question is, would it be hacked or would it be copied?

2:50:30.800 --> 2:50:31.800
 Will it be something better than that?

2:50:31.800 --> 2:50:33.800
 And it was copied 15,000 times.

2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:41.800
 And you know the story of all those and they either diverged to be something totally different and not comparable

2:50:41.800 --> 2:50:47.800
 or someone trying to copy a non sovereign bearer instrument store of value

2:50:47.800 --> 2:50:51.800
 found that their networks crashed to be 1% of what Bitcoin is.

2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:58.800
 So now we're sitting at a point where all those risks are out of the way.

2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:05.800
 I would say that year one of institutional adoption is it started August 2020.

2:51:05.800 --> 2:51:10.800
 That's when MicroStrategy bought $250 million worth of Bitcoin and we put that on the wire.

2:51:10.800 --> 2:51:15.800
 We were the first publicly traded company to actually buy Bitcoin.

2:51:15.800 --> 2:51:19.800
 I don't think you could have found a $5 million purchase from a public company before we did that.

2:51:19.800 --> 2:51:23.800
 So that was kind of like a gun going off.

2:51:23.800 --> 2:51:29.800
 And then in the next 12 months, Tesla bought Bitcoin, Square bought Bitcoin.

2:51:29.800 --> 2:51:33.800
 And I'd say now we're in year two of institutional adoption.

2:51:33.800 --> 2:51:39.800
 And about 24, should be 24 publicly traded Bitcoin miners by the end of this quarter.

2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:47.800
 So you're looking at 36 publicly traded companies and you've got 50,

2:51:47.800 --> 2:51:54.800
 at least in the range of $50 billion on the balance of Bitcoin on the balance sheet of publicly traded companies

2:51:54.800 --> 2:52:01.800
 and hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap of Bitcoin exposed companies.

2:52:01.800 --> 2:52:10.800
 So I would say the asset decade one was entrepreneurial experimental.

2:52:10.800 --> 2:52:16.800
 Decade two is a rotation from entrepreneurs institutions and is becoming institutionalized.

2:52:16.800 --> 2:52:22.800
 So maybe decade one, you go from zero to a trillion and in decade two, you go from one trillion to a hundred trillion.

2:52:22.800 --> 2:52:26.800
 What about government adoption, institutional adoption?

2:52:26.800 --> 2:52:28.800
 Are governments important in this?

2:52:28.800 --> 2:52:37.800
 Maybe making it some governments, incorporating it as a currency into their banks, all that kind of stuff.

2:52:37.800 --> 2:52:38.800
 Is that important?

2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:42.800
 And if it is, when will it happen?

2:52:42.800 --> 2:52:50.800
 It's not essential for the success of the asset class, but I think it's inevitable in various degrees over time.

2:52:50.800 --> 2:53:03.800
 But the most likely thing to happen next is large acquisitions by institutional investors of Bitcoin as a digital gold,

2:53:03.800 --> 2:53:08.800
 where they're just swapping out gold for digital gold and thinking of it like that.

2:53:08.800 --> 2:53:12.800
 And the government entities most likely to be involved with that would be sovereign wealth funds.

2:53:12.800 --> 2:53:21.800
 If you look at all the sovereign wealth funds that are holding a big tech stock, equities, the Swiss, the Norwegians, the Middle Easterners.

2:53:21.800 --> 2:53:28.800
 If you can hold big tech, then holding digital gold would be not far removed from that.

2:53:28.800 --> 2:53:33.800
 That's a noncontroversial adoption.

2:53:33.800 --> 2:53:39.800
 I think there are opportunities for governments that are much more profound.

2:53:39.800 --> 2:53:46.800
 If a government started to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset,

2:53:46.800 --> 2:53:50.800
 that's much bigger than just an asset investment.

2:53:50.800 --> 2:53:53.800
 That's a hundred X bigger.

2:53:53.800 --> 2:53:57.800
 And you could imagine that's like a trillion dollar opportunity.

2:53:57.800 --> 2:54:05.800
 A government that wanted to adopt it as a treasury reserve asset would probably generate trillions of dollars, a trillion or more of value.

2:54:05.800 --> 2:54:15.800
 And then the thing that people think about is, well, will oil ever be priced in Bitcoin or any other export commodity?

2:54:15.800 --> 2:54:21.800
 I think there's like $1.8 trillion or more of export commodities in the world.

2:54:21.800 --> 2:54:23.800
 And right now they're all priced in dollars.

2:54:23.800 --> 2:54:27.800
 I think that this is a colorful thing, but it's not really that relevant.

2:54:27.800 --> 2:54:30.800
 You could sell all that stuff in dollars.

2:54:30.800 --> 2:54:40.800
 The relevant decision that any institution makes, whether they're a nonprofit, a university, a corporation, or a government, is what's your treasury reserve asset?

2:54:40.800 --> 2:54:49.800
 And if your treasury reserve asset is the peso, and if the peso is losing 20% or 30% of its value a year,

2:54:49.800 --> 2:54:56.800
 then your balance sheet is collapsing within five years.

2:54:56.800 --> 2:55:07.800
 And if the treasury reserve asset is dollars and currency derivatives and US treasuries, then you're getting your seven.

2:55:07.800 --> 2:55:12.800
 Right now it's probably 15% or more monetary inflation.

2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:15.800
 We're running double the historic average.

2:55:15.800 --> 2:55:21.800
 You could argue triple, somewhere between double and triple, depending upon what your metric is.

2:55:21.800 --> 2:55:23.800
 So do I think it'll happen?

2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:25.800
 I think that they're conservative, but they have to be shocked.

2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:28.800
 And I think there is a shock.

2:55:28.800 --> 2:55:37.800
 The late Russian sanctions are a big shock that when the West sees $300 billion worth of Russian gold and currency derivatives,

2:55:37.800 --> 2:55:45.800
 you know, you got the famous quote by Putin that, you know, we have to rethink our treasury strategies.

2:55:45.800 --> 2:55:48.800
 And that pushes everybody toward a commodity strategy.

2:55:48.800 --> 2:55:50.800
 What commodities do I want to hold?

2:55:50.800 --> 2:55:52.800
 I think that's got a lot of people thinking.

2:55:52.800 --> 2:55:54.800
 I think it's got the Chinese thinking.

2:55:54.800 --> 2:55:57.800
 Everybody wants to be the reserve currency, right?

2:55:57.800 --> 2:56:07.800
 So if I buy $50 billion worth of dollars every year, then I buy $500 billion over a decade.

2:56:07.800 --> 2:56:19.800
 And I probably pay $250 billion of inflation cost on the backs of my citizens in a decade.

2:56:19.800 --> 2:56:22.800
 So inflation could be one of the sources of shock.

2:56:22.800 --> 2:56:28.800
 And you wonder if there is a switch to Bitcoin, whether it will be a bang or a whimper,

2:56:28.800 --> 2:56:31.800
 like what is the nature of the shock or the transition?

2:56:31.800 --> 2:56:41.800
 I think that the year 2022 is pretty catalytic for digital assets in general and for Bitcoin in particular.

2:56:41.800 --> 2:56:46.800
 The Canadian trucker crisis, I think, educated hundreds of millions of people

2:56:46.800 --> 2:56:52.800
 and made them start questioning their property rights and their banks.

2:56:52.800 --> 2:57:03.800
 I think the Ukraine war was a second shock, but I think that the Russian sanctions was a third shock.

2:57:03.800 --> 2:57:10.800
 I think all three of them, and I think hyperinflation in the rest of the world is a fourth shock

2:57:10.800 --> 2:57:13.800
 and then persistent inflation in the U.S. is a fifth shock.

2:57:13.800 --> 2:57:16.800
 So I think it's a perfect storm.

2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:21.800
 And if you put all these events together, what do they signify?

2:57:21.800 --> 2:57:30.800
 They signify the rational conclusion for any person thinking about this is I'm not sure if I can trust my property.

2:57:30.800 --> 2:57:32.800
 I don't know if I have property rights.

2:57:32.800 --> 2:57:34.800
 I don't know if I can trust the bank.

2:57:34.800 --> 2:57:42.800
 And if I'm politically at odds with the leader of my own country, I'm going to lose my property.

2:57:42.800 --> 2:57:49.800
 And if I'm politically at odds with the owner of another country, I'm still going to lose my property.

2:57:49.800 --> 2:57:55.800
 And when push comes to shove, the banks will freeze my assets and seize them.

2:57:55.800 --> 2:58:08.800
 And I think that that is playing out in front of everybody in the world such that your logical response would be,

2:58:08.800 --> 2:58:17.800
 I'm going to convert my weak currency to a strong currency like I'll convert my peso and lira to the dollar.

2:58:17.800 --> 2:58:22.800
 I'm going to convert my weak property to strong property.

2:58:22.800 --> 2:58:30.800
 I'm going to sell my building downtown Moscow and I'd rather own a building in New York City.

2:58:30.800 --> 2:58:39.800
 I'd rather own in a powerful nation than be stuck with a building in Nigeria or a building in Argentina or whatever.

2:58:39.800 --> 2:58:42.800
 So I'm going to sell my weak properties by strong properties.

2:58:42.800 --> 2:58:46.800
 I'm going to convert my physical assets to digital assets.

2:58:46.800 --> 2:58:53.800
 I'd rather own a digital building than own a physical building because if I had a billion dollar building in Moscow,

2:58:53.800 --> 2:58:55.800
 who can I rent that to?

2:58:55.800 --> 2:59:01.800
 But if I have a billion dollar digital building, I can rent it to anybody in any city in the world.

2:59:01.800 --> 2:59:07.800
 Anybody with money and the maintenance cost is almost nothing and I can hold it for 100 years.

2:59:07.800 --> 2:59:09.800
 So it's an indestructible building.

2:59:09.800 --> 2:59:18.800
 And then finally, I want to move from having my assets in a bank with a counterparty to self custody assets.

2:59:18.800 --> 2:59:28.800
 And this is not just Ukraine, but this is like the story in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, South America.

2:59:28.800 --> 2:59:33.800
 You don't really want to be sitting with $10 million in a bank in Istanbul.

2:59:33.800 --> 2:59:41.800
 The bank's going to freeze your money, convert it to lira, devalue the lira, and then feed it back to you over 17 years, right?

2:59:41.800 --> 2:59:45.800
 So self custody assets would be layer one, Bitcoin.

2:59:45.800 --> 2:59:48.800
 Self custody assets.

2:59:48.800 --> 2:59:59.800
 If I got my own hardware wallet and I've either got your highest form of self custody would be Bitcoin on your own hardware wallet

2:59:59.800 --> 3:00:01.800
 or Bitcoin in your own self custody.

3:00:01.800 --> 3:00:09.800
 And the other thing people think about is how do I get crypto dollars like Tether, like some stablecoin?

3:00:09.800 --> 3:00:15.800
 Like I'd rather, if you had a choice, would you rather have your money in a bank in a war zone in dollars

3:00:15.800 --> 3:00:22.800
 or have your money in a stablecoin on your mobile phone in dollars, right?

3:00:22.800 --> 3:00:26.800
 I mean, you take the latter risk rather than the former risk.

3:00:26.800 --> 3:00:27.800
 In a war zone, definitely, yeah.

3:00:27.800 --> 3:00:29.800
 And you can see that happening.

3:00:29.800 --> 3:00:35.800
 Like we've gone from $5 billion in stablecoins to $200 billion in the last 24 months.

3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:43.800
 So I do think there's massive demand for crypto dollars in the form of a US dollar asset.

3:00:43.800 --> 3:00:48.800
 And there's, and everybody in the world would say, yeah, I want that.

3:00:48.800 --> 3:00:54.800
 Well, unless you're just an extreme patriot, but most people in the world would say I want that.

3:00:54.800 --> 3:01:00.800
 And then a lesser group of people would say, I think I want to be able to carry my property in the palm of my hand.

3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:03.800
 So I have self custody of it.

3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:07.800
 So a Bitcoin price has gone through quite a roller coaster.

3:01:07.800 --> 3:01:11.800
 What do you think is the high point it's going to hit?

3:01:11.800 --> 3:01:13.800
 I think it'll go forever, right?

3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:19.800
 I mean, I think the Bitcoin is going to, it's going to climb in a serpentine fashion.

3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:25.800
 It's going to advance and come back and it's going to keep, it's going to keep climbing.

3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:31.800
 I think that the volatility attracts all the capital into the marketplace.

3:01:31.800 --> 3:01:36.800
 And so the volatility makes it the most interesting thing in the financial universe.

3:01:36.800 --> 3:01:41.800
 It also generates massive yield and massive returns for traders.

3:01:41.800 --> 3:01:43.800
 And that attracts capital.

3:01:43.800 --> 3:01:48.800
 Like we're talking about the difference between 5% return and 500% return.

3:01:48.800 --> 3:01:54.800
 So the fast money is attracted by the volatility.

3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:58.800
 The volatility has been decreasing year by year by year.

3:01:58.800 --> 3:02:02.800
 I think that it's stabilizing.

3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:06.800
 I don't think we'll see as much volatility in the future as we have in the past.

3:02:06.800 --> 3:02:14.800
 I think that if we look at Bitcoin and model it as digital gold, you know,

3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:18.800
 the market cap goes to between 10 and 20 trillion.

3:02:18.800 --> 3:02:22.800
 But gold is, remember, gold is defective property.

3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:24.800
 Gold is dead money.

3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:27.800
 You have a billion dollars of gold that sits in a vault for a decade.

3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:29.800
 It's very hard to mortgage the gold.

3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:31.800
 It's also very hard to rent the gold.

3:02:31.800 --> 3:02:33.800
 You can't loan the gold.

3:02:33.800 --> 3:02:36.800
 No one's going to create a business with your gold.

3:02:36.800 --> 3:02:39.800
 So gold doesn't generate much of a yield.

3:02:39.800 --> 3:02:43.800
 So for that reason, most people wouldn't store a billion dollars for a decade in gold.

3:02:43.800 --> 3:02:46.800
 They would buy a billion dollars of commercial real estate property.

3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:51.800
 And the reason why is because I can rent it and generate a yield on it

3:02:51.800 --> 3:02:53.800
 that's in excess of the maintenance cost.

3:02:53.800 --> 3:03:02.800
 So if you consider digital property, that's 100 to 200 trillion dollar addressable market.

3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:05.800
 So I would think it, you know, it goes from 10 trillion to 100 trillion

3:03:05.800 --> 3:03:07.800
 as people start to think of it as digital property.

3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:11.800
 What does that mean in terms of price per coin?

3:03:11.800 --> 3:03:14.800
 At 500,000, right?

3:03:14.800 --> 3:03:16.800
 That's a 10 trillion dollar asset.

3:03:16.800 --> 3:03:20.800
 At 5 million, that's 100 trillion dollar asset.

3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:23.800
 So I think it crosses a million, it can go even higher.

3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:25.800
 Yeah, I think it keeps going up forever.

3:03:25.800 --> 3:03:28.800
 I mean, as a result, it can go to 10 million a coin, right?

3:03:28.800 --> 3:03:31.800
 Because digital property isn't the highest form, right?

3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:34.800
 Gold was that low frequency money.

3:03:34.800 --> 3:03:37.800
 Property is a mid frequency money.

3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:45.800
 But when I start to program it faster, it starts to look like digital energy.

3:03:45.800 --> 3:03:49.800
 And then it doesn't just replace property.

3:03:49.800 --> 3:03:52.800
 Then you're starting to replace bonds.

3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:54.800
 It's 100 trillion in bonds.

3:03:54.800 --> 3:03:58.800
 There's 50 to 100 trillion in other currency derivatives.

3:03:58.800 --> 3:04:02.800
 And then these are all conventional use cases, right?

3:04:02.800 --> 3:04:13.800
 I think that there's 350 trillion to 500 trillion dollars worth of currency derivatives in the world.

3:04:13.800 --> 3:04:18.800
 And when I say that, I mean things that are valued based upon fiat cash flows.

3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:24.800
 Any commercial real estate, any bond, any sovereign debt, any currency itself,

3:04:24.800 --> 3:04:31.800
 any derivatives to those things, they're all derivatives and they're all defective.

3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:37.800
 And they're all defective because of this persistent 7 to 14 percent lapse,

3:04:37.800 --> 3:04:40.800
 which we call inflation or monetary expansion.

3:04:40.800 --> 3:04:41.800
 Can we switch?

3:04:41.800 --> 3:04:46.800
 So I'm just going to talk about the energy side of it, like the innovative piece.

3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:53.800
 Let's just start with this idea that I've got a hotel worth a billion dollars with a thousand rooms.

3:04:53.800 --> 3:04:56.800
 When it becomes a dematerialized hotel.

3:04:56.800 --> 3:04:58.800
 I love that word so much, by the way.

3:04:58.800 --> 3:04:59.800
 Dematerialized hotel.

3:04:59.800 --> 3:05:01.800
 We're across in the fountain blow here.

3:05:01.800 --> 3:05:03.800
 Imagine the fountain blow is dematerialized.

3:05:03.800 --> 3:05:09.800
 The problem with the physical hotel is I've got to hire real people moving subject to the speed of sound

3:05:09.800 --> 3:05:14.800
 and physics laws and Newton's laws and I can rent it to people in Miami Beach.

3:05:14.800 --> 3:05:19.800
 But if it was a digital hotel, I could rent the room to people in Paris,

3:05:19.800 --> 3:05:24.800
 London and New York every night and I can run it with robots.

3:05:24.800 --> 3:05:29.800
 And as soon as I do that, I can rent it by the room hour and I can rent it by the room minute.

3:05:29.800 --> 3:05:39.800
 And so I start to chop my hotel up into a hundred thousand room hours that I sell to the highest bidder anywhere in the world.

3:05:39.800 --> 3:05:49.800
 And you can see all of a sudden the yield, the rent and the income of the property is dramatically increased.

3:05:49.800 --> 3:05:53.800
 I can also see the maintenance cost of the property falls.

3:05:53.800 --> 3:05:57.800
 I get on Moore's law and I'm operating in cyberspace.

3:05:57.800 --> 3:05:59.800
 So I got rid of Newton's laws.

3:05:59.800 --> 3:06:02.800
 I got rid of all the friction and all those problems.

3:06:02.800 --> 3:06:06.800
 I tapped into the benefits of cyberspace.

3:06:06.800 --> 3:06:09.800
 I created a global property.

3:06:09.800 --> 3:06:12.800
 I started monetizing at different frequencies.

3:06:12.800 --> 3:06:17.800
 And of course now I can mortgage it to anybody in the world.

3:06:17.800 --> 3:06:23.800
 You're not going to be able to get a mortgage on a Turkish building from someone in South Africa.

3:06:23.800 --> 3:06:28.800
 You have to have to find someone that's local to the culture you're in.

3:06:28.800 --> 3:06:35.800
 So when you start to move from analog property to digital property, it's not just a little bit better.

3:06:35.800 --> 3:06:37.800
 It's a lot better.

3:06:37.800 --> 3:06:41.800
 And what I just described, Lex, is like the DeFi vision.

3:06:41.800 --> 3:06:47.800
 It's the beauty of DeFi, flash loans, money moving at high velocity.

3:06:47.800 --> 3:07:01.800
 At some point, if the hotel is dematerialized, then what's the difference between running a hotel room and loaning a block of stock?

3:07:01.800 --> 3:07:04.800
 I'm just finding the highest best use of the thing.

3:07:04.800 --> 3:07:13.800
 It feels like the magic really emerges, though, when you build a lot, a market of layer two and layer three technologies on top of that.

3:07:13.800 --> 3:07:24.800
 Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but for all these hotels and all these kinds of ideas, it's always touching humans at some point.

3:07:24.800 --> 3:07:40.800
 And consumers or humans, business owners and so on, so you have to create interface, you have to create services that make all of that super efficient, super fun to use, pleasant, effective, all those kinds of things.

3:07:40.800 --> 3:07:43.800
 So you have to build a whole economy on top of that.

3:07:43.800 --> 3:07:47.800
 Yeah, and I happen to think that won't be done by the crypto industry at all.

3:07:47.800 --> 3:07:50.800
 I think that'll be done by centralized applications.

3:07:50.800 --> 3:07:56.800
 I think it'll be the citadels of the world, the high speed traders of the world, the New Yorkers.

3:07:56.800 --> 3:08:09.800
 I think it'll be Binance FTX and Coinbase as a layer three exchange that will give you the yield and will give you the loan and the best terms.

3:08:09.800 --> 3:08:21.800
 Because ultimately, you have to jump these compliance hoops. Like BlockFi can give you yield, but they have to do it in a compliant way with the United States jurisdiction.

3:08:21.800 --> 3:08:33.800
 So ultimately, those applications to use that digital property and either generate a loan, give you a loan on it or give you yield on it are going to come from companies.

3:08:33.800 --> 3:08:40.800
 But the difference, the fundamental difference is it could be companies anywhere in the world.

3:08:40.800 --> 3:08:49.800
 So if a company in Singapore comes up with a better offering, right, then the capital is going to start to flow to Singapore.

3:08:49.800 --> 3:09:00.800
 I can't send 10 city blocks of LA to Singapore to rent during a festival, but I can send 10 blocks of Bitcoin to Singapore.

3:09:00.800 --> 3:09:07.800
 So you've got a truly global market that's functioning in this asset and is a second order asset.

3:09:07.800 --> 3:09:15.800
 For example, maybe you're an American citizen and you own 10 Bitcoin and someone in Singapore will generate 27% yield in the Bitcoin.

3:09:15.800 --> 3:09:19.800
 But legally, you can't send the money to them or the Bitcoin to them.

3:09:19.800 --> 3:09:28.800
 It doesn't matter because the fact that that exists means that someone in Hong Kong will borrow the 10 Bitcoin from somebody in New York

3:09:28.800 --> 3:09:35.800
 and then they will put on the trade in Singapore and that will create a demand for Bitcoin, which will drive up the price of Bitcoin,

3:09:35.800 --> 3:09:42.800
 which will result in an effective tax free yield for the person in the US that's not even in the jurisdiction.

3:09:42.800 --> 3:09:49.800
 So there's nothing that's going on in Singapore to drive up the price of your land in LA.

3:09:49.800 --> 3:09:58.800
 But there is something going on everywhere in the world to drive up the price of property in cyberspace if there's only one digital Manhattan.

3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:04.800
 And so there's a dynamic there, which is profound because it's global.

3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:06.800
 But now let's go to the next extreme.

3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:18.800
 I'm still giving you a fairly conventional idea, which is let's just loan the money fast on a global network and let's just rent the hotel room fast in cyberspace.

3:10:18.800 --> 3:10:23.800
 But let's move to maybe a more innovative idea.

3:10:23.800 --> 3:10:30.800
 The first generation of internet brought a lot of productivity, but there's also just a lot of flaws in it.

3:10:30.800 --> 3:10:33.800
 For example, Twitter is full of garbage.

3:10:33.800 --> 3:10:36.800
 Instagram DMs are full of garbage.

3:10:36.800 --> 3:10:38.800
 Your Twitter DMs are full of garbage.

3:10:38.800 --> 3:10:40.800
 YouTube is full of scams.

3:10:40.800 --> 3:10:45.800
 Every 15 minutes, there's a Michael Saylor Bitcoin giveaway spun up on YouTube.

3:10:45.800 --> 3:10:49.800
 My Office 365 inbox is full of garbage.

3:10:49.800 --> 3:10:51.800
 Millions of spam messages.

3:10:51.800 --> 3:10:55.800
 I'm running four different email filters.

3:10:55.800 --> 3:11:02.800
 My company spends million dollars a year to fight denial of service attacks and all sorts of other security things.

3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:08.800
 There are denial of service attacks everywhere against everybody in cyberspace all the time.

3:11:08.800 --> 3:11:09.800
 It's extreme.

3:11:09.800 --> 3:11:11.800
 And we're all beset with hostility, right?

3:11:11.800 --> 3:11:14.800
 You've been a victim of it on Twitter.

3:11:14.800 --> 3:11:19.800
 You go on Twitter and people post stuff they would never say to your face.

3:11:19.800 --> 3:11:26.800
 And then if you look, you find out that their account was created like three days ago and it's not even a real person.

3:11:26.800 --> 3:11:32.800
 So we're beset with phishing attacks and scams and spam bots and garbage.

3:11:32.800 --> 3:11:34.800
 And why?

3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:39.800
 And the answer is because the first generation of internet was digital information and there's no energy.

3:11:39.800 --> 3:11:43.800
 There's no conservation of energy in cyberspace.

3:11:43.800 --> 3:11:48.800
 The thing that makes the universe work is conservation of energy.

3:11:48.800 --> 3:11:59.800
 Like if I went to a hotel room, I'd have to post a credit card and then if I smashed the place up, there'd be economic consequences.

3:11:59.800 --> 3:12:02.800
 Maybe there'd be criminal consequences.

3:12:02.800 --> 3:12:05.800
 There might be reputational consequences.

3:12:05.800 --> 3:12:07.800
 You know, lamp might fall on me.

3:12:07.800 --> 3:12:11.800
 But in the worst case, I can only smash up one hotel room.

3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:18.800
 Now imagine I could actually write a Python script to send myself to every hotel room in the world every minute,

3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:25.800
 not post a credit card and smash them all up anonymously.

3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:31.800
 The thing that makes the universe work is friction, speed of sound, speed of light,

3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:35.800
 and the fact that ultimately it's conservative.

3:12:35.800 --> 3:12:39.800
 You're either energy or matter, but once you've used the energy, it's gone.

3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:42.800
 You can't do infinite everything.

3:12:42.800 --> 3:12:45.800
 That's missing in cyberspace right now.

3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:54.800
 And if you look at all of the moral hazards and all of the product defects that we have in all of these products,

3:12:54.800 --> 3:13:04.800
 most of them, 99% of them could be cured if we introduced conservation of energy into cyberspace.

3:13:04.800 --> 3:13:09.800
 And that's what you can do with high speed digital property, high speed Bitcoin.

3:13:09.800 --> 3:13:15.800
 And by high speed, I mean not 20 transactions a day, I mean 20,000 transactions a day.

3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:18.800
 So how do you do that?

3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:28.800
 Well, I let everybody on Twitter post 1,000 or 10,000 Satoshis via a lightning badge.

3:13:28.800 --> 3:13:30.800
 Give me an orange check.

3:13:30.800 --> 3:13:37.800
 If you put up 20 bucks once in your life, you could give 300 million people an orange check.

3:13:37.800 --> 3:13:41.800
 Right now, you don't have a blue check, Lex.

3:13:41.800 --> 3:13:42.800
 You're a famous person.

3:13:42.800 --> 3:13:44.800
 I don't know why you don't have a blue check.

3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:46.800
 Have you ever applied for a blue check?

3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:47.800
 No.

3:13:47.800 --> 3:13:50.800
 There are 360,000 people on Twitter with a blue check.

3:13:50.800 --> 3:13:53.800
 There are 300 million people on Twitter.

3:13:53.800 --> 3:14:01.800
 So the conventional way to verify accounts is elitist archaic.

3:14:01.800 --> 3:14:02.800
 How does it work?

3:14:02.800 --> 3:14:04.800
 How did you get a blue check?

3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:14.800
 You got to apply and wait six months and you have to post three articles in the public mainstream media that illustrates you're a person of interest.

3:14:14.800 --> 3:14:15.800
 Interesting.

3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:26.800
 Generally, they would grant them to CEOs of public companies or the whole idea is to verify that you are who you say you are.

3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:29.800
 But the question is, why isn't everybody verified?

3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:31.800
 And there's a couple of threads on that.

3:14:31.800 --> 3:14:33.800
 One is some people don't want to be doxxed.

3:14:33.800 --> 3:14:35.800
 They want to be anonymous.

3:14:35.800 --> 3:14:40.800
 But they're even anonymous people that should be verified.

3:14:40.800 --> 3:14:48.800
 Because otherwise, you're subjecting their entire following to phishing attacks and scams and hostility.

3:14:48.800 --> 3:14:50.800
 But the other...

3:14:50.800 --> 3:14:52.800
 What's the orange verification?

3:14:52.800 --> 3:14:56.800
 So this idea, can you actually elaborate a little bit more if you put up 20 bucks?

3:14:56.800 --> 3:15:02.800
 Yeah, I think everybody on Twitter ought to be able to get an orange check if they could come up with like $10.

3:15:02.800 --> 3:15:05.800
 And what is the power of that orange check?

3:15:05.800 --> 3:15:07.800
 What does that verify exactly?

3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:13.800
 You basically post a security deposit for your safe passage through cyberspace.

3:15:13.800 --> 3:15:21.800
 So the way it would work is, if you've got $10 once in your life, you can basically show that you're credit worthy.

3:15:21.800 --> 3:15:26.800
 And that's your pledge to me that you're going to act responsibly.

3:15:26.800 --> 3:15:32.800
 So you put the $10 or the $20 into the lightning wallet, you get an orange check.

3:15:32.800 --> 3:15:37.800
 Then Twitter just gives you a setting where I can say, the only people who can DM me are orange checks.

3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:40.800
 The only people who can post on my tweets are orange checks.

3:15:40.800 --> 3:15:48.800
 So instead of locking out the public and just letting your followers, you know, comment, you lock out all the unverified.

3:15:48.800 --> 3:15:53.800
 And that means people that don't want to post $10 security deposit can't comment.

3:15:53.800 --> 3:16:00.800
 Once you've done those two things, then you're in a position to monetize malice.

3:16:00.800 --> 3:16:03.800
 Monetize motion or malice for that matter.

3:16:03.800 --> 3:16:14.800
 But let's just say, for the sake of argument, you post something and 9700 bots spin up and pitch their whatever scam.

3:16:14.800 --> 3:16:19.800
 Right now you sit and you go report, report, report, report, report, report.

3:16:19.800 --> 3:16:24.800
 And if you spend an hour, you get through half of them, you waste an hour of your life.

3:16:24.800 --> 3:16:30.800
 They just spin up another 97 gazillion because they've got a Python script spinning it up, so it's hopeless.

3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:34.800
 But on the other hand, if you report them and they really are a bot,

3:16:34.800 --> 3:16:38.800
 Twitter's got a method to actually delete the account.

3:16:38.800 --> 3:16:40.800
 They know that they're bots.

3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:42.800
 The problem is not they don't want to delete the account.

3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:45.800
 The problem is there are no consequences when they delete the account.

3:16:45.800 --> 3:16:53.800
 So if there are consequences, Twitter could give, they could just seize the $10 or seize the $20 because it's a bot.

3:16:53.800 --> 3:17:00.800
 It's a malicious criminal act or whatever as a violation of the platform rules.

3:17:00.800 --> 3:17:07.800
 You end up seizing $10,000, give half the money to the reporter and half the money to the Twitter platform.

3:17:07.800 --> 3:17:15.800
 That's a really powerful idea, but that's tying it, that's adding friction akin to the kind of friction you have in the physical world.

3:17:15.800 --> 3:17:18.800
 You're tying, you have consequences, you have real consequences.

3:17:18.800 --> 3:17:20.800
 It's putting conservation of energy.

3:17:20.800 --> 3:17:21.800
 Conservation of energy.

3:17:21.800 --> 3:17:24.800
 There's no friction, there's no nothing on this earth.

3:17:24.800 --> 3:17:28.800
 You can't walk across the room without friction.

3:17:28.800 --> 3:17:31.800
 Friction is not bad.

3:17:31.800 --> 3:17:37.800
 Unnecessary friction is bad.

3:17:37.800 --> 3:17:41.800
 So in this particular case, you're introducing conservation of energy.

3:17:41.800 --> 3:17:47.800
 In essence, you're introducing the concept of consequence or truth into cyberspace.

3:17:47.800 --> 3:17:54.800
 And that means if you do want to spend up 10 million fake less Freedmen's, right?

3:17:54.800 --> 3:17:59.800
 It's going to cost you $100 million to spend up 10 million fake Lexus.

3:17:59.800 --> 3:18:09.800
 But the thing is, you could do that with the dollar, but you're saying that it's more tied to physical reality when you do that with Bitcoin.

3:18:09.800 --> 3:18:12.800
 Yeah, well, let's follow up on that idea a bit more.

3:18:12.800 --> 3:18:20.800
 If you did do it with the dollar, then the question is, how does 6 billion people deposit the dollars?

3:18:20.800 --> 3:18:24.800
 Because what you're doing is, could you do it with a credit card?

3:18:24.800 --> 3:18:27.800
 Like, how do you send dollars?

3:18:27.800 --> 3:18:29.800
 You have to dox yourself.

3:18:29.800 --> 3:18:31.800
 It's not easy.

3:18:31.800 --> 3:18:35.800
 So you're talking about inputting a credit card transaction, doxing yourself.

3:18:35.800 --> 3:18:40.800
 And now you've just eliminated the 2 billion people that don't have credit cards or don't have banks.

3:18:40.800 --> 3:18:43.800
 You've also got a problem with everybody that wants to remain anonymous.

3:18:43.800 --> 3:18:54.800
 But you've also got this other problem, which is credit cards are expensive transactions, low frequency, slow settlement.

3:18:54.800 --> 3:19:01.800
 So do you really want to pay 2.5% every time you actually show a $20 deposit?

3:19:01.800 --> 3:19:07.800
 And maybe you could do a Kluge version of this for a subset of people.

3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:13.800
 It's 10% as good if you did it with conventional payment rails.

3:19:13.800 --> 3:19:25.800
 But what you can't do is the next idea, which is, I want the orange badge to be used to give me safe passage through cyberspace,

3:19:25.800 --> 3:19:27.800
 tripping across every platform.

3:19:27.800 --> 3:19:33.800
 So how do I solve the denial of service attacks against a website?

3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:39.800
 I publish a website, you hit it with a million requests.

3:19:39.800 --> 3:19:41.800
 Okay, now how do I deal with that?

3:19:41.800 --> 3:19:45.800
 Well, I can lock you out and I can make it a zero trust website.

3:19:45.800 --> 3:19:51.800
 And then you have to be coming at me through a trusted firewall or with a trusted credential.

3:19:51.800 --> 3:19:54.800
 But that's a pretty draconian thing.

3:19:54.800 --> 3:19:57.800
 Or I could put it behind a lightning wall.

3:19:57.800 --> 3:20:01.800
 A lightning wall would be, you know, I just challenge you, Lex.

3:20:01.800 --> 3:20:07.800
 You want to browse my website, you have to show me your 100,000 Satoshis.

3:20:07.800 --> 3:20:09.800
 Do you have 100,000 Satoshis?

3:20:09.800 --> 3:20:10.800
 Click.

3:20:10.800 --> 3:20:11.800
 Okay.

3:20:11.800 --> 3:20:15.800
 Now you click away a hundred times or a thousand times.

3:20:15.800 --> 3:20:19.800
 And after a thousand times, you know, well, now, Lex, you're getting offensive,

3:20:19.800 --> 3:20:23.800
 but I take a Satoshi from you or 10 Satoshis, a microtransaction.

3:20:23.800 --> 3:20:24.800
 You want to hit me a million times?

3:20:24.800 --> 3:20:27.800
 I'm taking all your Satoshis and locking you out.

3:20:27.800 --> 3:20:33.800
 What you want to do is you want to go through 200 websites a day.

3:20:33.800 --> 3:20:40.800
 And what you want, every time you cross a domain, you need to be able to, in a split second,

3:20:40.800 --> 3:20:43.800
 prove that you've got some asset.

3:20:43.800 --> 3:20:48.800
 And now when you cross back, when you exit domain, you want to fetch your asset back.

3:20:48.800 --> 3:20:54.800
 So how do I, in a friction free fashion, browse through dozens or hundreds of websites,

3:20:54.800 --> 3:20:59.800
 post a security deposit for safe passage and then get it back.

3:20:59.800 --> 3:21:03.800
 You couldn't afford to pay a credit card fee each time.

3:21:03.800 --> 3:21:12.800
 When you think about 2.5% as a transaction fee, it means you trade the money 40 times and it's gone.

3:21:12.800 --> 3:21:13.800
 Yeah.

3:21:13.800 --> 3:21:14.800
 It's gone.

3:21:14.800 --> 3:21:15.800
 Yeah.

3:21:15.800 --> 3:21:19.800
 So you can't do this kind of hopping around through the internet with this kind of verification

3:21:19.800 --> 3:21:22.800
 that grounds you to physical reality.

3:21:22.800 --> 3:21:24.800
 It's a really, really interesting idea.

3:21:24.800 --> 3:21:27.800
 Why hasn't that been done?

3:21:27.800 --> 3:21:29.800
 I think you need two things.

3:21:29.800 --> 3:21:33.800
 You need an idea like a digital asset like Bitcoin.

3:21:33.800 --> 3:21:36.800
 It's a bearer instrument for final settlement.

3:21:36.800 --> 3:21:46.800
 And then you need a high speed transaction network like Lightning where the transaction cost might be a 20th of a penny or less.

3:21:46.800 --> 3:21:50.800
 And if you roll the clock back 24 months,

3:21:50.800 --> 3:21:54.800
 I don't think you had the Lightning network in a stable point.

3:21:54.800 --> 3:21:56.800
 It's really just the past 12 months.

3:21:56.800 --> 3:22:00.800
 It's an idea you could think about this year.

3:22:00.800 --> 3:22:09.800
 And I think you need to be aware of Bitcoin as something other than like a scary speculative asset.

3:22:09.800 --> 3:22:11.800
 So I really think we're just the beginning.

3:22:11.800 --> 3:22:13.800
 The embryonic stage.

3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:19.800
 I have to ask Michael Saylor, you said before there's no second best to Bitcoin.

3:22:19.800 --> 3:22:21.800
 What would be the second best?

3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:23.800
 Traditionally, there's Ethereum with smart contracts.

3:22:23.800 --> 3:22:25.800
 Cardano with proof of stake.

3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:30.800
 Polkadot with interoperability between blockchains.

3:22:30.800 --> 3:22:34.800
 Dogecoin has the incredible power of the meme.

3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:37.800
 Privacy with Monero.

3:22:37.800 --> 3:22:39.800
 I just can't keep going.

3:22:39.800 --> 3:22:47.800
 There's, of course, after the block size wars, the different offshoots of Bitcoin.

3:22:47.800 --> 3:22:53.800
 I think if you decompose or segment the crypto market, you've got crypto property.

3:22:53.800 --> 3:22:55.800
 Bitcoin is the king of that.

3:22:55.800 --> 3:23:03.800
 Another Bitcoin fork that wanted to be a bearer instrument store of value would be a property.

3:23:03.800 --> 3:23:06.800
 Bitcoin cash or litecoin, something like that.

3:23:06.800 --> 3:23:09.800
 Then you've got cryptocurrencies.

3:23:09.800 --> 3:23:15.800
 I don't think Bitcoin is a currency because a currency I define in nation states since,

3:23:15.800 --> 3:23:24.800
 a currency is a digital asset that you can transfer in a transaction without incurring a taxable obligation.

3:23:24.800 --> 3:23:29.800
 That means it has to be a stable dollar or a stable euro or a stable yen, a stablecoin.

3:23:29.800 --> 3:23:31.800
 I think you've got cryptocurrencies.

3:23:31.800 --> 3:23:33.800
 Tether, Circle Most Famous.

3:23:33.800 --> 3:23:36.800
 I think you've got crypto platforms.

3:23:36.800 --> 3:23:39.800
 Ethereum is the most famous of the crypto platforms.

3:23:39.800 --> 3:23:45.800
 It's the platform upon which, with smart contract functionality, et cetera.

3:23:45.800 --> 3:23:47.800
 Then I think you've got just crypto securities.

3:23:47.800 --> 3:23:51.800
 It's just like my favorite, whatever, meme coin.

3:23:51.800 --> 3:23:56.800
 I love it because I love it and it's attached to my game or my company or my persona or my whatever.

3:23:56.800 --> 3:24:01.800
 I think if you pushed me and said, what's the second best?

3:24:01.800 --> 3:24:03.800
 I would say the world wants two things.

3:24:03.800 --> 3:24:09.800
 It wants crypto property as a savings account and it wants cryptocurrency as a checking account.

3:24:09.800 --> 3:24:16.800
 That means that the most popular thing really is going to be a stablecoin dollar.

3:24:16.800 --> 3:24:19.800
 There's maybe a fight right now.

3:24:19.800 --> 3:24:27.800
 It might be tether, but a stable dollar because I feel like the market opportunity,

3:24:27.800 --> 3:24:29.800
 it's not clear that there'll be one that will win.

3:24:29.800 --> 3:24:35.800
 The class of stable dollars is probably a $1 to $10 trillion market easily.

3:24:35.800 --> 3:24:43.800
 I think that in a crypto platform space, Ethereum will compete with Solana and Binance Smart Chain and the like.

3:24:43.800 --> 3:24:48.800
 Are there certain characteristics of any of them that kind of stand out to you?

3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:52.800
 Don't you think the competition is based on a set of features?

3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:59.800
 Also, the set of features that cryptocurrency provides but also the community that it provides.

3:24:59.800 --> 3:25:05.800
 The community matters and the adoption, the dynamic of the adoption both across the developers and the investors.

3:25:05.800 --> 3:25:11.800
 If I'm looking at them, the first question is, what's the regulatory risk?

3:25:11.800 --> 3:25:14.800
 How likely is it to be deemed a property versus security?

3:25:14.800 --> 3:25:22.800
 The second is, what's the competitive risk? The third is, what's the speed and the performance?

3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:27.800
 All those things lead to the question of what's the security risk?

3:25:27.800 --> 3:25:33.800
 How likely is it to crash and burn and how stable or unstable is it?

3:25:33.800 --> 3:25:36.800
 Then there's the marketing risk.

3:25:36.800 --> 3:25:41.800
 There are different teams behind each of these things and communities behind them.

3:25:41.800 --> 3:25:50.800
 I think that the big cloud looming over the crypto industry is regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies

3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:54.800
 and regulatory treatment of crypto securities and crypto platforms.

3:25:54.800 --> 3:25:58.800
 I think that won't be determined until the end of the first Biden administration.

3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:06.800
 For example, there are people that would like only US FDIC insured banks to issue cryptocurrencies.

3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:11.800
 They want JP Morgan to issue a crypto dollar backed one to one.

3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:17.800
 But then in the US right now, we have Circle and we have other companies that are licensed entities

3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:21.800
 that are backed by cash and cash equivalents, but they're not FDIC insured banks.

3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:27.800
 There's also a debate in Congress about whether state chartered banks should be able to issue these things.

3:26:27.800 --> 3:26:34.800
 Then we have Tether and others that are outside of the US jurisdiction.

3:26:34.800 --> 3:26:36.800
 They're probably not backed by cash and cash equivalents.

3:26:36.800 --> 3:26:39.800
 They're backed by stuff and we don't know what stuff.

3:26:39.800 --> 3:26:52.800
 Then finally, you have UST and DAI, which are algorithmic stablecoins that are even more innovative further outside the compliance framework.

3:26:52.800 --> 3:27:00.800
 If you ask who's going to win, the question is really, I don't know, will the market decide or will the regulators decide?

3:27:00.800 --> 3:27:05.800
 If the regulators get out of the way and the market fought out, well, then it's an interesting discussion.

3:27:05.800 --> 3:27:11.800
 Then I think that all bets are off if the regulators get more heavy handed with this.

3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:17.800
 I think you could have the same discussion with crypto properties, like the DeFi exchanges and the crypto exchanges.

3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:20.800
 The SEC would like to regulate the crypto exchanges.

3:27:20.800 --> 3:27:22.800
 They'd like to regulate the DeFi exchanges.

3:27:22.800 --> 3:27:28.800
 That means they may regulate the crypto platforms and at what rate and in what fashion.

3:27:28.800 --> 3:27:37.800
 I think that I could give you an opinion if it was limited to competition and the current regulatory regime.

3:27:37.800 --> 3:27:55.800
 I think that the regulations are so fast moving and it's so uncertain that you can't make a decision without considering the potential actions of the regulators.

3:27:55.800 --> 3:27:57.800
 I hope the regulators get out of the way.

3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:08.800
 Can you still man the case that Dogecoin is, I guess, the second best cryptocurrency if you don't consider Bitcoin a cryptocurrency, but instead a crypto property?

3:28:08.800 --> 3:28:12.800
 I would classify it as crypto property because the US dollar is a currency.

3:28:12.800 --> 3:28:19.800
 So unless your crypto asset is pegged algorithmically or stably to the value of the dollar, it's not a currency.

3:28:19.800 --> 3:28:22.800
 It's a property or it's an asset.

3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:28.800
 So then can you still man the case that Dogecoin is the best cryptocurrency then?

3:28:28.800 --> 3:28:32.800
 Because Bitcoin is not even in that list.

3:28:32.800 --> 3:28:38.800
 The debate is going to be whether it's property or security and there's a debate whether it's decentralized enough.

3:28:38.800 --> 3:28:41.800
 So let's assume it was decentralized.

3:28:41.800 --> 3:28:55.800
 Well, it's increasing at not quite what, 5% a year inflation rate, but it's not 5% exponentially. It's like a plus 5 million, 5% something captain is less.

3:28:55.800 --> 3:28:59.800
 I forget the exact number, but it's an inflationary property.

3:28:59.800 --> 3:29:09.800
 It's got a lower inflation rate than the US dollar and it's got a much lower inflation rate than many other fiat currencies.

3:29:09.800 --> 3:29:11.800
 So I think you could say that.

3:29:11.800 --> 3:29:24.800
 But don't you see the power of meme, the power of ideas, the power of fun or whatever mechanism is used to captivate a community?

3:29:24.800 --> 3:29:26.800
 I do, but there are meme stocks.

3:29:26.800 --> 3:29:33.800
 It doesn't absolve you of your ethical and securities liabilities if you're promoting it.

3:29:33.800 --> 3:29:39.800
 So I don't have a problem with people buying a stock.

3:29:39.800 --> 3:29:49.800
 The way I divide the world is there's investment, there's saving and there's speculation and there's trading.

3:29:49.800 --> 3:29:53.800
 So Bitcoin is an asset for saving.

3:29:53.800 --> 3:30:00.800
 If you want to save money for 100 years, you don't really want to take on execution risk or the like.

3:30:00.800 --> 3:30:03.800
 So you're just buying something to hold forever.

3:30:03.800 --> 3:30:10.800
 For you to actually endorse something as a property, like if you said to me, Mike, what should I buy for the next 100 years?

3:30:10.800 --> 3:30:16.800
 I say, well, some amount of real estate, some amount of scarce collectibles, some amount of Bitcoin.

3:30:16.800 --> 3:30:21.800
 You can run your company, but running your company is an investment.

3:30:21.800 --> 3:30:23.800
 So the savings are properties.

3:30:23.800 --> 3:30:25.800
 If you said, what should I invest in?

3:30:25.800 --> 3:30:28.800
 I'd say, well, here's a list of good companies, private companies.

3:30:28.800 --> 3:30:33.800
 You can start your own company, that's an investment.

3:30:33.800 --> 3:30:36.800
 If you said, what should I trade?

3:30:36.800 --> 3:30:38.800
 Well, trading is like a proprietary thing.

3:30:38.800 --> 3:30:42.800
 I don't have any special insight into that.

3:30:42.800 --> 3:30:44.800
 If you're a good trader, you know you are.

3:30:44.800 --> 3:30:47.800
 If you said to me, what should you speculate in?

3:30:47.800 --> 3:30:54.800
 We talk about meme stocks and meme coins and it kind of sits up there.

3:30:54.800 --> 3:30:59.800
 It's right in the same space with what horse should you bet on and what sports team should you gamble on?

3:30:59.800 --> 3:31:04.800
 And should you bet on black six times in a row and double down each time?

3:31:04.800 --> 3:31:11.800
 I mean, it's fun, but at the end of the day, it's a speculation, right?

3:31:11.800 --> 3:31:15.800
 You can't build a civilization on it.

3:31:15.800 --> 3:31:17.800
 It's not an institutional asset.

3:31:17.800 --> 3:31:24.800
 In fact, where I'd leave it, right, is Bitcoin is clearly a digital product which makes it an institutional grade

3:31:24.800 --> 3:31:31.800
 investable asset for a public company, a public figure, a public investor, or anybody that's risk adverse.

3:31:31.800 --> 3:31:39.800
 I think that the top 100 other cryptos are like venture capital investments.

3:31:39.800 --> 3:31:45.800
 And if you're a VC and if you're a qualified technical investor and you have a pool of capital and you can take that kind of risk,

3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:49.800
 then you can parse through that and form opinions.

3:31:49.800 --> 3:31:56.800
 It's just orders of magnitude more risky because of competition, because of ambition, and because of regulation.

3:31:56.800 --> 3:32:03.800
 And if you take the meme coins, it's like, you know, when some rapper comes out with a meme coin,

3:32:03.800 --> 3:32:07.800
 it's like maybe it'll peak when I hear about it, right?

3:32:07.800 --> 3:32:17.800
 I mean, SHIB was created as the coin such that it had so many zeros after decimal point that when you looked at it on the exchanges,

3:32:17.800 --> 3:32:20.800
 it always showed 0, 0, 0, 0.

3:32:20.800 --> 3:32:27.800
 And it wasn't until like six months after it got popular that they started expanding the display so you could see whether the price had changed.

3:32:27.800 --> 3:32:28.800
 That's speculation.

3:32:28.800 --> 3:32:36.800
 Maybe you can correct me, but you've been critical of Elon Musk in the past in the crypto space.

3:32:36.800 --> 3:32:41.800
 Where do you stand on Elon's effect on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general these days?

3:32:41.800 --> 3:32:49.800
 I believe that Bitcoin is a massive breakthrough for the human race that will cure half the problems in the world

3:32:49.800 --> 3:32:54.800
 and generate hundreds of trillions of dollars of economic value to the civilization.

3:32:54.800 --> 3:33:04.800
 And I believe that it's in an early stage where many people don't understand it and they're afraid of it and there's FUD.

3:33:04.800 --> 3:33:07.800
 And there's uncertainty, there's doubt and there's fear.

3:33:07.800 --> 3:33:15.800
 And there's a very noisy crypto world and there's 15,000 other cryptos that are seeking relevance.

3:33:15.800 --> 3:33:22.800
 And I think most of the FUD is actually fueled by the other crypto entrepreneurs.

3:33:22.800 --> 3:33:32.800
 So the environmental FUD and the other types of uncertainty that surround Bitcoin, generally, they're not coming from legitimate environmentalists.

3:33:32.800 --> 3:33:35.800
 They don't come from legitimate critics.

3:33:35.800 --> 3:33:47.800
 They actually are guerrilla marketing campaigns that are being financed and fueled by other crypto entrepreneurs because they have an interest in doing so.

3:33:47.800 --> 3:34:01.800
 So if I look at the constructive path forward, first, I think it'd be very constructive for corporations to embrace Bitcoin and build applications on top of it.

3:34:01.800 --> 3:34:06.800
 You don't need to fix it. There's nothing wrong with it, right?

3:34:06.800 --> 3:34:12.800
 Like when you put it on a layer two and a layer three, it moves a billion times a second at the speed of light.

3:34:12.800 --> 3:34:21.800
 So every beautiful, cool, DeFi application, every crypto application, everything you could imagine you might want to do,

3:34:21.800 --> 3:34:35.800
 you can do with a legitimate company and a legitimate website or mobile application sitting on top of Bitcoin or lightning if you want to.

3:34:35.800 --> 3:34:41.800
 So I think that to the extent that people do that, that's going to be better for the world.

3:34:41.800 --> 3:34:49.800
 If you consider what holds people back, I think it's just misperceptions about what Bitcoin is.

3:34:49.800 --> 3:34:53.800
 So I'm a big fan of just educating people.

3:34:53.800 --> 3:34:58.800
 If you're not going to commercialize it, then just educate people on what it is.

3:34:58.800 --> 3:35:06.800
 So for example, Bitcoin is the most efficient use of energy in the world by far, right?

3:35:06.800 --> 3:35:13.800
 Most people don't necessarily perceive that or realize that, but if you were to take any metric, energy intensity,

3:35:13.800 --> 3:35:21.800
 you put like $2 billion worth of electricity in the network every year and it's worth $850 billion.

3:35:21.800 --> 3:35:28.800
 There is no industry in the real world that is that energy efficient.

3:35:28.800 --> 3:35:31.800
 Not only that energy efficient, it's also the most sustainable industry.

3:35:31.800 --> 3:35:33.800
 We do surveys.

3:35:33.800 --> 3:35:37.800
 58% of Bitcoin mining energy is sustainable.

3:35:37.800 --> 3:35:40.800
 So there's a very good story.

3:35:40.800 --> 3:35:47.800
 In fact, every other industry, planes, trains, automobiles, construction, food, medicine, everything else.

3:35:47.800 --> 3:35:51.800
 It's less clean, less efficient.

3:35:51.800 --> 3:35:53.800
 So the basic debate was...

3:35:53.800 --> 3:35:55.800
 I wouldn't say there is a debate.

3:35:55.800 --> 3:35:59.800
 I would just say that to the extent that the Bitcoin community had any issue with Elon,

3:35:59.800 --> 3:36:09.800
 it was just this environmental uncertainty that he fueled in a couple of his tweets, right?

3:36:09.800 --> 3:36:12.800
 Which I think just is very distracting.

3:36:12.800 --> 3:36:16.800
 Well, that was one of them, but I think it's like the Bitcoin maximalist,

3:36:16.800 --> 3:36:20.800
 but generally the crypto community, what you call the crypto entrepreneurs,

3:36:20.800 --> 3:36:28.800
 is also they're using it for investment, for speculation,

3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:37.800
 and therefore get very passionate about people's kind of celebrities, including you, like famous people,

3:36:37.800 --> 3:36:45.800
 saying positive stuff about any one particular crypto thing,

3:36:45.800 --> 3:36:47.800
 a thing you can buy in Coinbase.

3:36:47.800 --> 3:36:53.800
 And so they might be unhappy with Elon Musk that he's promoting Bitcoin and then not,

3:36:53.800 --> 3:36:56.800
 and then promoting Dogecoin, then not,

3:36:56.800 --> 3:36:59.800
 and this kind of...

3:36:59.800 --> 3:37:04.800
 There's so much emotion tied up in the communication on this topic.

3:37:04.800 --> 3:37:07.800
 And I think that's where a lot of the...

3:37:07.800 --> 3:37:11.800
 Look, I don't have a criticism of Elon Musk.

3:37:11.800 --> 3:37:13.800
 He's free to do whatever he wishes to do.

3:37:13.800 --> 3:37:20.800
 In fact, Elon Musk is the second largest supporter of Bitcoin in the world.

3:37:20.800 --> 3:37:24.800
 So I think that the Bitcoin community tends to eat its own quite a bit.

3:37:24.800 --> 3:37:28.800
 It tends to be very self critical.

3:37:28.800 --> 3:37:34.800
 And instead of saying, well, Elon is more supportive of Bitcoin

3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:39.800
 than the other 10,000 people in the world with serious amounts of money,

3:37:39.800 --> 3:37:42.800
 they focus upon...

3:37:42.800 --> 3:37:43.800
 Yeah, this is strange.

3:37:43.800 --> 3:37:45.800
 Eating your own is just...

3:37:45.800 --> 3:37:48.800
 So I mean, I think he's free to do what he wants to do.

3:37:48.800 --> 3:37:51.800
 And I think he's done a lot of good for Bitcoin

3:37:51.800 --> 3:37:55.800
 in putting it on the balance sheet of Tesla and holding it.

3:37:55.800 --> 3:37:59.800
 And I think that sent a very powerful message.

3:37:59.800 --> 3:38:01.800
 Do you have advice for young people?

3:38:01.800 --> 3:38:04.800
 So you've had a heck of a life.

3:38:04.800 --> 3:38:07.800
 You've done quite a lot of things.

3:38:07.800 --> 3:38:10.800
 Start before MIT, but starting with MIT.

3:38:10.800 --> 3:38:14.800
 Is there advice here for young people in high school and college?

3:38:14.800 --> 3:38:20.800
 How to have a career they can be proud of?

3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:23.800
 How to have a life they can be proud of?

3:38:23.800 --> 3:38:30.800
 I was asked by somebody for quick advice for his young children.

3:38:30.800 --> 3:38:33.800
 He had twins when they entered adulthood.

3:38:33.800 --> 3:38:36.800
 He said, give me your advice for them in a letter.

3:38:36.800 --> 3:38:41.800
 I'm going to give it to them when they turn 21 or something.

3:38:41.800 --> 3:38:43.800
 So then he handed...

3:38:43.800 --> 3:38:46.800
 I thought I was at a party and then he handed me this sheet of paper.

3:38:46.800 --> 3:38:48.800
 I thought, oh, he wants me to write it down right now.

3:38:48.800 --> 3:38:50.800
 So I sat down, I started writing and I figured,

3:38:50.800 --> 3:38:53.800
 do you want to tell someone at age 21?

3:38:53.800 --> 3:38:54.800
 You wrote it down.

3:38:54.800 --> 3:38:55.800
 So I wrote it down.

3:38:55.800 --> 3:38:57.800
 Then I tweeted it and it's sitting on Twitter,

3:38:57.800 --> 3:38:58.800
 but I tell you what I said.

3:38:58.800 --> 3:39:01.800
 I said, my advice if you're entering adulthood.

3:39:01.800 --> 3:39:05.800
 Focus your energy.

3:39:05.800 --> 3:39:07.800
 Guard your time.

3:39:07.800 --> 3:39:10.800
 Train your mind.

3:39:10.800 --> 3:39:13.800
 Train your body.

3:39:13.800 --> 3:39:15.800
 Think for yourself.

3:39:15.800 --> 3:39:18.800
 Curate your friends.

3:39:18.800 --> 3:39:22.800
 Curate your environment.

3:39:22.800 --> 3:39:25.800
 Keep your promises.

3:39:25.800 --> 3:39:28.800
 Stay cheerful and constructive.

3:39:28.800 --> 3:39:30.800
 And upgrade the world.

3:39:30.800 --> 3:39:32.800
 That was the 10.

3:39:32.800 --> 3:39:33.800
 Upgrade the world.

3:39:33.800 --> 3:39:35.800
 That's an interesting choice of words.

3:39:35.800 --> 3:39:37.800
 Upgrade the world.

3:39:37.800 --> 3:39:39.800
 Upgrade the world.

3:39:39.800 --> 3:39:41.800
 It's like an engineer.

3:39:41.800 --> 3:39:46.800
 It's a very engineering themed...

3:39:46.800 --> 3:39:50.800
 Keep your promises to the interesting one.

3:39:50.800 --> 3:39:53.800
 I think most people suffer because they just...

3:39:53.800 --> 3:39:55.800
 They don't focus.

3:39:55.800 --> 3:39:57.800
 You got to figure out...

3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:01.800
 I think the big risk in this world is there's too much of everything.

3:40:01.800 --> 3:40:05.800
 You can sit and watch chess videos a hundred hours a week

3:40:05.800 --> 3:40:08.800
 and you'll never get through all the chess videos.

3:40:08.800 --> 3:40:12.800
 There's too much of every possible thing,

3:40:12.800 --> 3:40:14.800
 too much of every good thing.

3:40:14.800 --> 3:40:18.800
 So figuring out what you want to do

3:40:18.800 --> 3:40:21.800
 and then everything will suck up your time, right?

3:40:21.800 --> 3:40:24.800
 There's a hundred streaming channels to binge watch on.

3:40:24.800 --> 3:40:26.800
 So you got to guard your time

3:40:26.800 --> 3:40:29.800
 and then train your body, train your mind

3:40:29.800 --> 3:40:32.800
 and control who's around you.

3:40:32.800 --> 3:40:35.800
 Control what surrounds you.

3:40:35.800 --> 3:40:40.800
 So ultimately in a world where there's too much of everything,

3:40:40.800 --> 3:40:44.800
 then your success... It's like those laser eyes.

3:40:44.800 --> 3:40:50.800
 You have to focus on just a few of those things.

3:40:50.800 --> 3:40:54.800
 Yeah, I mean, I got a thousand opinions we could talk about

3:40:54.800 --> 3:40:56.800
 and I could pursue a thousand things,

3:40:56.800 --> 3:40:58.800
 but I don't expect to be successful

3:40:58.800 --> 3:41:03.800
 and I'm not sure that my opinion in any of the 999

3:41:03.800 --> 3:41:08.800
 is any more valid than the leader of thought in that area.

3:41:08.800 --> 3:41:13.800
 So how about if I just focus upon one thing

3:41:13.800 --> 3:41:17.800
 and then deliver the best I can in the one thing?

3:41:17.800 --> 3:41:20.800
 That's the laser eye message.

3:41:20.800 --> 3:41:22.800
 The rest get you distracted.

3:41:22.800 --> 3:41:23.800
 How do you achieve that?

3:41:23.800 --> 3:41:26.800
 Do you find yourself given where you are in life

3:41:26.800 --> 3:41:29.800
 having to say no a lot

3:41:29.800 --> 3:41:33.800
 or just focus comes naturally when you just ignore everything?

3:41:33.800 --> 3:41:36.800
 So how do you achieve that focus?

3:41:36.800 --> 3:41:39.800
 I think it helps if people know what you're focused on.

3:41:39.800 --> 3:41:43.800
 So everything about you just radiates that people know.

3:41:43.800 --> 3:41:45.800
 If they know what you're focused on,

3:41:45.800 --> 3:41:50.800
 then you won't get so many other things coming your way.

3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:58.800
 If you dally or if you flirt with 27 different things,

3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:00.800
 then you're going to get approached by people

3:42:00.800 --> 3:42:03.800
 in each of the 27 communities, right?

3:42:03.800 --> 3:42:08.800
 You mentioned getting a PhD and giving your roots at MIT.

3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:12.800
 Do you think there's all kinds of journeys you can take

3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:14.800
 to educate yourself?

3:42:14.800 --> 3:42:19.800
 Do you think a PhD or school is still worth it?

3:42:19.800 --> 3:42:22.800
 Or is there other paths through life that...

3:42:22.800 --> 3:42:24.800
 Is it worth it if you have to pay for it?

3:42:24.800 --> 3:42:26.800
 Is it worth it if you spend the time on it?

3:42:26.800 --> 3:42:30.800
 The time and the money is a big cost.

3:42:30.800 --> 3:42:33.800
 I think...

3:42:33.800 --> 3:42:35.800
 Time probably the bigger one, right?

3:42:35.800 --> 3:42:40.800
 It seems clear to me that the world wants more specialists.

3:42:40.800 --> 3:42:47.800
 It wants you to be an expert and to focus on one area.

3:42:47.800 --> 3:42:52.800
 And it's punishing generalist jack of all trades,

3:42:52.800 --> 3:42:55.800
 especially people that are generalists in the physical realm,

3:42:55.800 --> 3:42:58.800
 because if you're a specialist in the digital realm,

3:42:58.800 --> 3:43:03.800
 you're the person with 700,000 followers on Twitter

3:43:03.800 --> 3:43:05.800
 and you show them how to tie knots,

3:43:05.800 --> 3:43:10.800
 or you're the banjo player with 1.8 million followers,

3:43:10.800 --> 3:43:14.800
 and whenever he types banjo, it's you, right?

3:43:14.800 --> 3:43:19.800
 And so the world wants people that do something well

3:43:19.800 --> 3:43:26.800
 and then it wants to stamp out 18 million copies of them.

3:43:26.800 --> 3:43:28.800
 That argues in favor of focus.

3:43:28.800 --> 3:43:33.800
 Now, the definition of a PhD is someone with enough of an education

3:43:33.800 --> 3:43:35.800
 that they're capable of or have made.

3:43:35.800 --> 3:43:37.800
 I guess to get a PhD, technically,

3:43:37.800 --> 3:43:40.800
 you have to have done a dissertation

3:43:40.800 --> 3:43:45.800
 where you made a seminal contribution to the body of human knowledge.

3:43:45.800 --> 3:43:47.800
 And if you haven't done that, technically,

3:43:47.800 --> 3:43:50.800
 you have a master's degree, but you're not a doctor.

3:43:50.800 --> 3:43:55.800
 So if you're interested in any of the academic disciplines

3:43:55.800 --> 3:43:58.800
 that a PhD would be granted for,

3:43:58.800 --> 3:44:01.800
 then I can see that being a reasonable pursuit.

3:44:01.800 --> 3:44:05.800
 But there are many people that are specialists.

3:44:05.800 --> 3:44:07.800
 You know the agitator?

3:44:07.800 --> 3:44:08.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:09.800
 The agitator on YouTube?

3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:10.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:44:10.800 --> 3:44:13.800
 He's the world's greatest chess commentator.

3:44:13.800 --> 3:44:14.800
 Yeah.

3:44:14.800 --> 3:44:15.800
 And I've watched his career

3:44:15.800 --> 3:44:18.800
 and he's got progressed way better and he's really good.

3:44:18.800 --> 3:44:20.800
 He's gonna love hearing this.

3:44:20.800 --> 3:44:22.800
 Yeah, if the agitator ever hears this,

3:44:22.800 --> 3:44:23.800
 I'm a big fan of the agitator.

3:44:23.800 --> 3:44:25.800
 I have to cut myself off, right,

3:44:25.800 --> 3:44:28.800
 because otherwise you'll watch the entire Paul Morphe saga

3:44:28.800 --> 3:44:30.800
 for your weekend.

3:44:30.800 --> 3:44:32.800
 But the point really is,

3:44:32.800 --> 3:44:36.800
 YouTube is full of experts who are specialists in something

3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:39.800
 and they rise to the top of their profession.

3:44:39.800 --> 3:44:44.800
 And Twitter is too, and the internet is.

3:44:44.800 --> 3:44:49.800
 So I would advocate that you figure out

3:44:49.800 --> 3:44:53.800
 what you're passionate about and what you're good at

3:44:53.800 --> 3:44:56.800
 and you do focus on it,

3:44:56.800 --> 3:45:01.800
 especially if the thing that you're doing can be automated.

3:45:01.800 --> 3:45:04.800
 The problem is, you know,

3:45:04.800 --> 3:45:08.800
 back to that 500,000 algebra teacher type comment,

3:45:08.800 --> 3:45:11.800
 the problem is if it is possible to be automated,

3:45:11.800 --> 3:45:15.800
 then over time someone's probably gonna automate it

3:45:15.800 --> 3:45:20.800
 and that squeezes, you know, the state space

3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:22.800
 of everybody else.

3:45:22.800 --> 3:45:24.800
 It's like, after the lockdowns,

3:45:24.800 --> 3:45:27.800
 it used to be there are like all these local bands

3:45:27.800 --> 3:45:30.800
 that played in bars and everybody went to the bar

3:45:30.800 --> 3:45:31.800
 to see the local band.

3:45:31.800 --> 3:45:33.800
 And then during the lockdown,

3:45:33.800 --> 3:45:36.800
 you would have like these six super groups

3:45:36.800 --> 3:45:39.800
 and they would all get 500,000 or a million followers

3:45:39.800 --> 3:45:44.800
 and all these smaller local bands just got no attention.

3:45:44.800 --> 3:45:47.800
 At all.

3:45:47.800 --> 3:45:50.800
 Well, the interesting thing is one of those 500,000

3:45:50.800 --> 3:45:53.800
 algebra teachers is likely to be part of the automation.

3:45:53.800 --> 3:45:56.800
 So it's like, it's an opportunity for you to think,

3:45:56.800 --> 3:46:02.800
 where's my field, my discipline evolving into?

3:46:02.800 --> 3:46:04.800
 I talked to a bunch of librarians,

3:46:04.800 --> 3:46:06.800
 just happened to be friends of librarians.

3:46:06.800 --> 3:46:10.800
 And that's libraries will probably be evolving

3:46:10.800 --> 3:46:13.800
 and it's up to you as a librarian to be one of the few

3:46:13.800 --> 3:46:17.800
 that remain in the rubble.

3:46:17.800 --> 3:46:19.800
 If you're gonna give commentary on Shakespeare plays,

3:46:19.800 --> 3:46:22.800
 I want you to basically do it for every Shakespeare play.

3:46:22.800 --> 3:46:24.800
 Like I want you to be the Shakespeare dude

3:46:24.800 --> 3:46:28.800
 because once I, once, just like Lex, you're like...

3:46:28.800 --> 3:46:30.800
 I don't know what kind of...

3:46:30.800 --> 3:46:34.800
 You're the deep thinking podcaster, right?

3:46:34.800 --> 3:46:37.800
 Or you're the podcaster that goes after

3:46:37.800 --> 3:46:41.800
 the deep intellectual conversations

3:46:41.800 --> 3:46:46.800
 and once I get comfortable with you and I like you,

3:46:46.800 --> 3:46:49.800
 then I start binge watching Lex.

3:46:49.800 --> 3:46:54.800
 But if you changed your format through 16 different formats

3:46:54.800 --> 3:46:57.800
 so that you could compete with 16 different other

3:46:57.800 --> 3:46:59.800
 personalities on YouTube,

3:46:59.800 --> 3:47:02.800
 you probably wouldn't beat any of them, right?

3:47:02.800 --> 3:47:04.800
 You would probably just kind of sink into the...

3:47:04.800 --> 3:47:06.800
 You're the number two or number three guy.

3:47:06.800 --> 3:47:09.800
 You're not the number one guy in the format.

3:47:09.800 --> 3:47:14.800
 And I think the algorithm, right?

3:47:14.800 --> 3:47:16.800
 The Twitter algorithm and the YouTube algorithm,

3:47:16.800 --> 3:47:19.800
 they really reward the person that's focused

3:47:19.800 --> 3:47:21.800
 on message consistent.

3:47:21.800 --> 3:47:24.800
 The world wants somebody they can trust

3:47:24.800 --> 3:47:26.800
 that's consistent and reliable

3:47:26.800 --> 3:47:29.800
 and they kind of want to know what they're getting into

3:47:29.800 --> 3:47:33.800
 because this is taken for granted maybe,

3:47:33.800 --> 3:47:37.800
 but there's 10 million people vying

3:47:37.800 --> 3:47:39.800
 for every hour of your time.

3:47:39.800 --> 3:47:43.800
 And so the fact that anybody gives you any time at all

3:47:43.800 --> 3:47:45.800
 is a huge privilege, right?

3:47:45.800 --> 3:47:47.800
 And you should be thanking them

3:47:47.800 --> 3:47:50.800
 and you should respect their time.

3:47:50.800 --> 3:47:53.800
 It's interesting that everything you said is very interesting,

3:47:53.800 --> 3:47:54.800
 but of course from my perspective

3:47:54.800 --> 3:47:56.800
 and probably from your perspective,

3:47:56.800 --> 3:47:59.800
 my actual life has nothing to do with...

3:47:59.800 --> 3:48:01.800
 It's just being focused on stuff.

3:48:01.800 --> 3:48:04.800
 And in my case, it's like focused on

3:48:04.800 --> 3:48:07.800
 doing the thing I really enjoy doing

3:48:07.800 --> 3:48:10.800
 and being myself and not caring about anything else.

3:48:10.800 --> 3:48:14.800
 Like I don't care about views or likes or attention.

3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:16.800
 And that just maintaining that focus

3:48:16.800 --> 3:48:18.800
 is the way from an individual perspective,

3:48:18.800 --> 3:48:20.800
 you live that life.

3:48:20.800 --> 3:48:23.800
 But yeah, it does seem that there's...

3:48:23.800 --> 3:48:27.800
 The world and technology is rewarding the specialization

3:48:27.800 --> 3:48:29.800
 and creating bigger and bigger platforms

3:48:29.800 --> 3:48:31.800
 for the different specializations.

3:48:31.800 --> 3:48:34.800
 And that lifts all boats actually

3:48:34.800 --> 3:48:36.800
 because the specializations get better

3:48:36.800 --> 3:48:38.800
 and better and better at teaching people

3:48:38.800 --> 3:48:41.800
 to do specific things and they educate themselves.

3:48:41.800 --> 3:48:44.800
 And it's just everybody gets more and more knowledgeable

3:48:44.800 --> 3:48:46.800
 and more and more empowered.

3:48:46.800 --> 3:48:49.800
 The reward for authenticity more than offsets

3:48:49.800 --> 3:48:52.800
 the specificity with which you pursue your mission.

3:48:52.800 --> 3:48:54.800
 It's like...

3:48:54.800 --> 3:48:58.800
 Another way to say it is like nobody wants to read advertising.

3:48:58.800 --> 3:49:03.800
 Like if you were to spend $100 million advertising your thing,

3:49:03.800 --> 3:49:05.800
 I probably wouldn't want to watch it.

3:49:05.800 --> 3:49:07.800
 But if you...

3:49:07.800 --> 3:49:09.800
 That's so fascinating.

3:49:09.800 --> 3:49:11.800
 We see the death of that.

3:49:11.800 --> 3:49:15.800
 And so the commercial shows are losing their audiences

3:49:15.800 --> 3:49:18.800
 and the authentic specialist

3:49:18.800 --> 3:49:23.800
 or the authentic artist are gaining their audience.

3:49:23.800 --> 3:49:25.800
 And that's a beautiful thing.

3:49:25.800 --> 3:49:28.800
 Speaking of deep thinking,

3:49:28.800 --> 3:49:30.800
 you're just a human.

3:49:30.800 --> 3:49:32.800
 Your life ends.

3:49:32.800 --> 3:49:35.800
 You've accumulated so much wisdom,

3:49:35.800 --> 3:49:38.800
 so much money, but the right ends.

3:49:38.800 --> 3:49:40.800
 Do you think about that?

3:49:40.800 --> 3:49:43.800
 Do you ponder your death, your mortality?

3:49:43.800 --> 3:49:46.800
 Are you afraid of it?

3:49:46.800 --> 3:49:50.800
 When I go, all my assets will flow into a foundation

3:49:50.800 --> 3:49:53.800
 and the foundation's mission is to make education free

3:49:53.800 --> 3:49:55.800
 for everybody forever.

3:49:55.800 --> 3:50:00.800
 And if I'm able to contribute to the creation

3:50:00.800 --> 3:50:05.800
 of a more perfect monetary system,

3:50:05.800 --> 3:50:09.800
 then maybe that foundation will go on forever.

3:50:09.800 --> 3:50:11.800
 The idea.

3:50:11.800 --> 3:50:13.800
 The foundation of the idea.

3:50:13.800 --> 3:50:16.800
 Each of the foundations.

3:50:16.800 --> 3:50:19.800
 It's not clear we're on the S curve of immortal life yet.

3:50:19.800 --> 3:50:21.800
 Like that's a biological question

3:50:21.800 --> 3:50:25.800
 and you asked that on some of your other interviews a lot.

3:50:25.800 --> 3:50:31.800
 I think that we are on the threshold of immortal life

3:50:31.800 --> 3:50:36.800
 for ideas or immortal life for certain institutions

3:50:36.800 --> 3:50:38.800
 or computer programs.

3:50:38.800 --> 3:50:40.800
 So if we can fix the money,

3:50:40.800 --> 3:50:45.800
 then you can create a technically perfected endowment.

3:50:45.800 --> 3:50:48.800
 And then the question really is what are your ideas?

3:50:48.800 --> 3:50:50.800
 What do you want to leave behind?

3:50:50.800 --> 3:50:54.800
 And so if it's a park, then you endow the park, right?

3:50:54.800 --> 3:50:56.800
 If it's free education, you endow that.

3:50:56.800 --> 3:51:01.800
 If it's some other ethical idea, right?

3:51:01.800 --> 3:51:05.800
 Does it make you sad that there's something

3:51:05.800 --> 3:51:10.800
 that you've endowed some very powerful idea

3:51:10.800 --> 3:51:16.800
 of digital energy that you help put into the world?

3:51:16.800 --> 3:51:20.800
 And your mind, your conscious mind

3:51:20.800 --> 3:51:24.800
 will no longer be there to experience it.

3:51:24.800 --> 3:51:26.800
 It's just gone forever.

3:51:26.800 --> 3:51:31.800
 I'd rather think that the thing that Satoshi taught us

3:51:31.800 --> 3:51:35.800
 is you should do your part during some phase of the journey

3:51:35.800 --> 3:51:38.800
 and then you should get out of the way.

3:51:38.800 --> 3:51:43.800
 And I think Steve Jobs said something similar to that effect

3:51:43.800 --> 3:51:46.800
 in a very, very famous speech one day,

3:51:46.800 --> 3:51:49.800
 which is, you know, death is a natural part of life

3:51:49.800 --> 3:51:52.800
 and it makes way for the next generation.

3:51:52.800 --> 3:51:57.800
 And I think the goal is you upgrade the world, right?

3:51:57.800 --> 3:52:00.800
 You leave it a better place, but you get out of the way.

3:52:00.800 --> 3:52:09.800
 And I think when that breaks down, you know, bad things happen.

3:52:09.800 --> 3:52:14.800
 I think nature cleanses itself as a cycle of life.

3:52:14.800 --> 3:52:18.800
 And speaking of one of great people who did also get out of the way

3:52:18.800 --> 3:52:19.800
 is George Washington.

3:52:19.800 --> 3:52:21.800
 So hopefully when you get out of the way,

3:52:21.800 --> 3:52:28.800
 nobody's bleeding you to death in hope of helping you.

3:52:28.800 --> 3:52:30.800
 What do you think, Joe?

3:52:30.800 --> 3:52:32.800
 A bit of a callback.

3:52:32.800 --> 3:52:34.800
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

3:52:34.800 --> 3:52:35.800
 What's the meaning of life?

3:52:35.800 --> 3:52:36.800
 Why are we here?

3:52:36.800 --> 3:52:39.800
 We talked about the rise of human civilization.

3:52:39.800 --> 3:52:41.800
 It seems like we're engineers at heart.

3:52:41.800 --> 3:52:46.800
 We'll build cool stuff, better and better use of energy,

3:52:46.800 --> 3:52:48.800
 channeling energy to be productive.

3:52:48.800 --> 3:52:49.800
 Why?

3:52:49.800 --> 3:52:54.800
 What's it all for?

3:52:54.800 --> 3:52:56.800
 You're getting metaphysical on me.

3:52:56.800 --> 3:52:57.800
 Very.

3:52:57.800 --> 3:52:58.800
 There's a beautiful boat to the left of us.

3:52:58.800 --> 3:52:59.800
 Like, why do we do that?

3:52:59.800 --> 3:53:02.800
 There's this boat that sailed the ocean.

3:53:02.800 --> 3:53:07.800
 Then we build models of it to celebrate great engineering of the past.

3:53:07.800 --> 3:53:10.800
 To engineer is divine.

3:53:10.800 --> 3:53:13.800
 You can make lots of arguments as well.

3:53:13.800 --> 3:53:18.800
 We're here to entertain ourselves or we're here to create something

3:53:18.800 --> 3:53:21.800
 that's beautiful or something that's functional.

3:53:21.800 --> 3:53:23.800
 I think if you're an engineer, you entertain yourself

3:53:23.800 --> 3:53:26.800
 by creating something that's both beautiful and functional.

3:53:26.800 --> 3:53:29.800
 So I think all three of those things, it's entertaining,

3:53:29.800 --> 3:53:32.800
 but it's ethical.

3:53:32.800 --> 3:53:37.800
 You've got to admire the first person that built a bridge

3:53:37.800 --> 3:53:41.800
 crossing a chasm or the first person to work out the problem

3:53:41.800 --> 3:53:44.800
 of how to get running water to a village.

3:53:44.800 --> 3:53:50.800
 The first person that figured out how to dam up a river

3:53:50.800 --> 3:53:53.800
 or mastered agriculture.

3:53:53.800 --> 3:53:56.800
 The guy that figured out how to grow fruit on trees

3:53:56.800 --> 3:54:00.800
 or created orchards and maybe one day had like 10 fruit trees

3:54:00.800 --> 3:54:02.800
 is pretty proud of himself.

3:54:02.800 --> 3:54:04.800
 So that's functional.

3:54:04.800 --> 3:54:07.800
 There is also something to that, just like you said,

3:54:07.800 --> 3:54:09.800
 that's just beautiful.

3:54:09.800 --> 3:54:15.800
 It does get you closer to, like you said, the divine.

3:54:15.800 --> 3:54:21.800
 Something, when you step back and look at the entirety of it,

3:54:21.800 --> 3:54:27.800
 a collective of humans using a beautiful invention

3:54:27.800 --> 3:54:32.800
 or creation or just something about this instrument

3:54:32.800 --> 3:54:37.800
 is creating a beautiful piece of music.

3:54:37.800 --> 3:54:39.800
 That seems just right.

3:54:39.800 --> 3:54:41.800
 That's what we're here for.

3:54:41.800 --> 3:54:44.800
 Whatever the divine is, it seems like we're here for that.

3:54:44.800 --> 3:54:47.800
 And I, of course, love talking to you because from the

3:54:47.800 --> 3:54:51.800
 parent perspective, the functional is ultimately the mechanism

3:54:51.800 --> 3:54:53.800
 towards the beauty.

3:54:53.800 --> 3:54:56.800
 Isn't there something beautiful about making the world

3:54:56.800 --> 3:54:59.800
 a better place for people that you love, your friends,

3:54:59.800 --> 3:55:02.800
 your family or yourself?

3:55:02.800 --> 3:55:04.800
 Yeah.

3:55:04.800 --> 3:55:11.800
 When you think about the entire arc of human existence

3:55:11.800 --> 3:55:14.800
 and you roll the clock back 500,000 years

3:55:14.800 --> 3:55:17.800
 and you think about every struggle of everyone

3:55:17.800 --> 3:55:20.800
 that came before us and everything they had to overcome

3:55:20.800 --> 3:55:23.800
 in order to put you here right now,

3:55:23.800 --> 3:55:27.800
 you gotta admire that, right?

3:55:27.800 --> 3:55:29.800
 You gotta respect that.

3:55:29.800 --> 3:55:31.800
 That's a heck of a gift they gave us.

3:55:31.800 --> 3:55:35.800
 It's also a heck of a responsibility.

3:55:35.800 --> 3:55:38.800
 Don't screw it up.

3:55:38.800 --> 3:55:41.800
 If I dropped you 500,000 years ago and I said

3:55:41.800 --> 3:55:47.800
 figure out steel refining or, you know, figure out

3:55:47.800 --> 3:55:51.800
 silicon chips, fabric production or whatever it is.

3:55:51.800 --> 3:55:53.800
 Just fly or fire.

3:55:53.800 --> 3:55:57.800
 And so now we're here and I guess the way you repay them is

3:55:57.800 --> 3:56:01.800
 you fix everything in front of your face you can, right?

3:56:01.800 --> 3:56:05.800
 And that means to someone like Elon, it means

3:56:05.800 --> 3:56:08.800
 get us off the planet, right?

3:56:08.800 --> 3:56:11.800
 To someone like me, it's like, I think, you know,

3:56:11.800 --> 3:56:14.800
 fix the energy in the system.

3:56:14.800 --> 3:56:16.800
 And that gives me hope, Michael.

3:56:16.800 --> 3:56:17.800
 This is an incredible conversation.

3:56:17.800 --> 3:56:18.800
 You're an incredible human.

3:56:18.800 --> 3:56:21.800
 It's a huge honor you would sit down with me.

3:56:21.800 --> 3:56:23.800
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

3:56:23.800 --> 3:56:25.800
 Yeah, thanks for having me, Alex.

3:56:25.800 --> 3:56:28.800
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Saylor.

3:56:28.800 --> 3:56:30.800
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors

3:56:30.800 --> 3:56:32.800

3:56:32.800 --> 3:56:36.800
 And now let me leave you with a few words from Francis Bacon.

3:56:36.800 --> 3:56:42.800
 Money is a great servant, but a bad master.

3:56:42.800 --> 3:57:07.800
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
