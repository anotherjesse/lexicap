 The following is a conversation with Anthony Pumpliano, entrepreneur, technology investor,

00:05.600 --> 00:12.160
 prolific writer, podcaster, and Twitter user on topics of finance, cryptocurrency, technology,

00:12.160 --> 00:20.720
 and economics. I highly recommend his popular podcast and daily letter called The Pump Podcast

00:20.720 --> 00:26.320
 and The Pump Letter. Quick thank you to our sponsors, Theragun Muscle Recovery Device,

00:32.880 --> 00:39.200
 support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that I'll be having many conversations in the

00:39.200 --> 00:45.280
 coming months about cryptocurrency with people of all kinds of backgrounds or worldviews. Those

00:45.280 --> 00:52.080
 who are proponents of Bitcoin like Anthony, Nick Carter, Robert Breedlove, Alex Glastine,

00:52.080 --> 00:57.920
 and many others, and those who are proponents of other cryptocurrency technologies like Vitalik

00:57.920 --> 01:04.560
 Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, Richard Hart, Sergey Nazarov, Sylvia Makali, and many others as well.

01:05.280 --> 01:11.760
 I'm not framing this as a debate. I'm simply looking to explore exciting ideas in the space of

01:11.760 --> 01:18.240
 technologies that could very well change human civilization and AGI civilization as well.

01:18.240 --> 01:24.080
 I appreciate that some communities are a bit more intense in their style of communication and others,

01:24.080 --> 01:30.800
 but I personally am only interested in open minded, respectful collaboration and exploring ideas.

01:30.800 --> 01:38.880
 I personally try to like to approach conversations by considering that I may be wrong about everything

01:38.880 --> 01:46.000
 and I'm looking to learn. I won't engage in groupthink, social signaling, outrage mobs,

01:46.000 --> 01:53.520
 mocking, and derision. If you do, I understand. It's just not my thing. I send you my love either way

01:53.520 --> 02:00.080
 and hope to meet you in person over some drinks, some good laughs, and a good conversation one day.

02:00.080 --> 02:06.560
 No matter the difference in style or substance, we're all just human after all. This is an amazing

02:06.560 --> 02:12.560
 ride we're all on together. Buy the ticket, take the ride, as Hunter S. Thompson said. Whether you

02:12.560 --> 02:21.200
 pay for that ticket with Bitcoin, Ethereum, the dollar, gold, seashells, a beer, or just a good old

02:21.200 --> 02:28.960
 smile. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Anthony Pumpliano.

02:29.920 --> 02:36.160
 You served in the U.S. Army for six years and spent 13 months in Iraq in 2008 and 2009.

02:36.160 --> 02:41.040
 Can you tell the story of why you joined the Army and what were some of the moving

02:41.040 --> 02:44.880
 difficult, maybe lasting experiences from the time you served?

02:44.880 --> 02:52.720
 Sure. I joined when I was 17 years old. I needed my parents to basically sign in order to join.

02:52.720 --> 02:57.040
 I graduated a semester early from high school and thought I was going to go play football in

02:57.040 --> 03:02.000
 college and enroll in the spring semester when that didn't happen. I basically was working at

03:02.000 --> 03:08.480
 Chick Flaying Quiznos and had in my mind, look, this is probably not the path in life that I want.

03:08.480 --> 03:12.640
 I knew I was going to go to college. I knew I was going to go play football in the fall,

03:12.640 --> 03:18.560
 but I had this window of time. I walked into a recruiting office and just basically was like,

03:18.560 --> 03:24.240
 I'm assuming you guys need some help. They gave me the whole pitch and gave you a signing bonus.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.720
 You can go jump out of planes and go do all this crazy stuff. I just said, okay, let's do it.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.520
 This was close to 9 11.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.600
 This was in 2006, about five years after.

03:35.600 --> 03:40.480
 So what impact, I mean, do you remember 9 11? What impact did that have on your thinking about this?

03:41.120 --> 03:49.200
 So I was in eighth grade, if I remember correctly, and I remember being in school when it happened,

03:49.200 --> 03:55.280
 and I walked into a classroom and the entire class, somebody else's class, they were all

03:56.080 --> 03:59.040
 talking to the teacher about something. The second that me and a couple other kids walked in,

03:59.040 --> 04:01.840
 everyone got real quiet and the teacher was like, hey, go back to your like, home room.

04:01.840 --> 04:06.560
 And so it was just kind of a weird, like what's going on. And the next thing I know,

04:06.560 --> 04:10.640
 they called all the students into the cafeteria. And this is back before, you know, every

04:10.640 --> 04:14.640
 classroom really had a television in it and, you know, cable and all that kind of stuff.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.080
 And so when we were there, they basically just said, listen, there's been this event

04:18.080 --> 04:22.320
 that's occurred, all of your parents are going to come pick you guys up and they'll explain it to you.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.400
 And so to, you know, a kid in eighth grade, you're basically like,

04:26.960 --> 04:30.960
 what happened? And so I got home and I remember talking to my dad about it.

04:30.960 --> 04:36.400
 And my dad basically gave me, you know, the, the core American kind of talking points, right?

04:36.400 --> 04:41.680
 Look, somebody from another country came here and tried to kill Americans and was successful in

04:41.680 --> 04:47.280
 doing that. And to some extent, he just said, and I'm willing to bet, you know, we're going to go

04:47.280 --> 04:51.040
 back after them. Did that wake you up a little bit to the idea that there's evil out there,

04:51.040 --> 04:54.480
 that, you know, even just the idea of terrorism for many people, that was,

04:54.480 --> 05:01.440
 um, when it hits you on your own land, it's a, it really shakes up your mind. In some sense,

05:01.440 --> 05:06.960
 World War II, that's why World War II was fundamentally different for Americans than

05:06.960 --> 05:13.920
 it is for the people like in Russia and England and France and, uh, in Europe in general is

05:14.960 --> 05:20.720
 there's something about when there's families, women, children dying on your own land,

05:20.720 --> 05:27.520
 and that's different. And that was one of the first times in America where like on your, of

05:27.520 --> 05:33.840
 course, it's Pearl Harbor, but like, this is like in recent history, it's like they hit us here.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.040
 That was like a profound idea.

05:37.040 --> 05:42.400
 I think America was very, very good at exporting the violence elsewhere for a long time. And, uh,

05:42.400 --> 05:48.240
 there was this element of complacency, but also this element of, uh, you know,

05:48.240 --> 05:52.880
 really just American superiority that doesn't happen here, right? And I think that that woke

05:52.880 --> 05:58.640
 people up not only to, um, kind of the idea that other places around the world may not like the

05:58.640 --> 06:04.320
 American ideals, may not like democracy and capitalism and, and that, but also, uh, maybe we

06:04.320 --> 06:09.360
 aren't as big, tough and secure as we thought we were, right? And so obviously I think you see

06:09.360 --> 06:13.920
 the kind of the over rotation with a lot of the kind of security theater that came after that of

06:13.920 --> 06:18.480
 almost psychologically, let's make our citizens feel like they're safe, even if the things that

06:18.480 --> 06:22.640
 we're doing don't necessarily, you know, kind of change that apparatus. But on top of that,

06:22.640 --> 06:28.720
 I think that it really woke people up to, uh, extremism around the world. And, uh, I don't

06:28.720 --> 06:33.760
 know if necessarily there was a change in the extremism as much as it just was an awareness

06:33.760 --> 06:39.360
 thing, right? How many people, you know, kind of drew a line from, was it 92 or 93 with the

06:39.360 --> 06:44.560
 World Trade Center bombing to, you know, deep levels of extremism and hatred of,

06:44.560 --> 06:49.920
 uh, kind of the American industrial complex? Probably not that many. 2001, a lot of people.

06:49.920 --> 06:53.760
 And so I think that was, you know, again, as a, as a young kid, you don't understand a lot of

06:53.760 --> 06:59.120
 this stuff. You basically just, hey, somebody came here and tried to kill Americans. And so,

06:59.120 --> 07:03.440
 you know, we should go fight back, right? Was kind of the, uh, the response I think that I had.

07:03.440 --> 07:10.640
 What role did that have psychologically for you when you then in 2006 joined the army? I mean,

07:10.640 --> 07:17.680
 this is a very different joining the army than in a time when like it's more peaceful. Here,

07:17.680 --> 07:22.240
 you're essentially facing, I mean, I don't know if you see it that way, but, you know, there is a

07:22.240 --> 07:27.840
 war on terror. And I know that people kind of, uh, criticize that whole formulation framework of

07:27.840 --> 07:33.360
 thinking. But nevertheless, you are going to Iraq, you are going to Afghanistan, you're going to

07:33.360 --> 07:39.760
 these places and are fighting these complicated, like, I mean, it's not even clear what you're

07:39.760 --> 07:44.480
 fighting. Yeah. Well, I think that there's a couple of key pieces, right? So one, like one of the

07:44.480 --> 07:49.680
 actual most impactful data points, if you were, or kind of stories for me, uh, was the Pat Tillman

07:49.680 --> 07:54.960
 story. So I played football, uh, in high school and I was going to go play in college. Um, and

07:54.960 --> 07:59.600
 seeing, you know, this NFL player who basically just one day said, Hey, I'm going to go and do this

07:59.600 --> 08:06.080
 instead, uh, and walk away. I don't know necessarily if it was a, uh, I want to pursue the same story,

08:06.080 --> 08:10.160
 right? And obviously he ended up dying. And so not exactly the, uh, the end result that you want,

08:10.160 --> 08:15.200
 but I think it was almost like, uh, he made it okay if you were on a certain trajectory in life

08:15.200 --> 08:21.360
 to go take this detour and, and to go do it. Um, but the second thing is I was 17, pretty stupid

08:21.360 --> 08:27.440
 when you're 17, pretty naive when you're 17, right? And so, uh, I almost, um, kind of backed into

08:27.440 --> 08:33.280
 the deployment because I signed up, uh, as a, uh, a reserve member. And so basically the plan

08:33.280 --> 08:36.560
 was to sign up for the reserves. I was going to go to basic training, get all the, you know,

08:36.560 --> 08:41.280
 kind of education and qualification. I was going to go to college and then after college, you know,

08:41.280 --> 08:46.640
 maybe there's a chance that you will go and serve or do whatever. For me, I ended up getting deployed

08:46.640 --> 08:52.720
 when I was a junior in college that we got pulled out of school. And so at 20 years old, uh, it's

08:52.720 --> 08:56.640
 not exactly what you thought you were signing up for, right? Especially to kind of leave school

08:56.640 --> 09:01.440
 to go do it. And then on top of that, uh, I probably had an advantage over most people,

09:01.440 --> 09:07.360
 both on the, uh, entry to combat and the exit to, uh, kind of a combat situation, which was

09:07.360 --> 09:14.720
 football. So I always explain that, um, in hindsight, you're in a male dominated testosterone driven,

09:14.720 --> 09:20.160
 kind of combative sport where it's us first them and, and, uh, there's training and, and, uh,

09:20.160 --> 09:23.840
 you know, injuries and just kind of all of the things that go into playing a combat sport like

09:23.840 --> 09:28.800
 football to now they give you guns, but you still have a uniform on still male dominated.

09:28.800 --> 09:33.280
 It's just a little bit, you know, more serious in terms of the injuries and, and, uh, potential death

09:33.280 --> 09:38.880
 and things like that. But also on the exit from that deployment, most guys I was there with, they're

09:38.880 --> 09:44.880
 going back to being, you know, prison guards, police officers working at the lumber yard,

09:44.880 --> 09:52.480
 you know, just kind of everyday Americans. And so I had the fortunate ability to go back into,

09:52.480 --> 09:55.840
 kind of that combative environment, go back to play football. And so it was almost this like

09:55.840 --> 10:00.400
 deescalation on the way out, uh, where they take your guns away. We still got a uniform,

10:00.400 --> 10:04.960
 still male dominated, still combative. And then eventually you're just a normal citizen.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.800
 And so I think that in some weird way, I was, you know, very fortunate to kind of on the

10:08.800 --> 10:11.360
 entry and exit have that experience where other guys didn't.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.880
 So what you were deployed to Iraq, were there any memories, experiences that changed you?

10:18.880 --> 10:24.640
 Or in general, like you're probably a different man on the other side of it. How did that time

10:24.640 --> 10:29.280
 change you? I think there, there was two main takeaways that I took, right? So one was, um,

10:29.280 --> 10:34.160
 not a specific moment, but on multiple occasions, uh, I remember we were driving down the road and

10:34.160 --> 10:39.840
 I would look and there would be a 10, 12, 14 year old kid. And if you've never seen somebody who

10:39.840 --> 10:45.680
 literally has hate and disdain in their eyes, what was you? Just, just not necessarily to you

10:45.680 --> 10:50.480
 personally, just to the uniform, to what you stand for, it's all this stuff. When you see it, you

10:50.480 --> 10:56.240
 see it, right? And I always think of, um, if you've ever, uh, watched the movie a 12 strong and in

10:56.240 --> 11:00.960
 it, uh, they've got this Afghan, uh, Afghanistan warlord and he's talking to a bunch of soldiers

11:00.960 --> 11:04.800
 and he says, you know, you don't have killer eyes, you do, you do. And he's just like, he can just

11:04.800 --> 11:10.240
 tell, right? He's, he's seen so many soldiers. And so I think that that was a, a memory on a

11:10.240 --> 11:16.240
 memory on a number of occasions where I just saw a young kid and I just said, they hate us, right?

11:16.240 --> 11:21.200
 And, and it's not you personally, it's what you stand for. But the, the really big event was, um,

11:21.200 --> 11:26.480
 when you first get to, uh, these combat zones, a lot of times what will happen is, uh, you basically,

11:26.480 --> 11:30.720
 your unit teams up with a unit that's leaving and there's a handoff and happens over a couple of

11:30.720 --> 11:35.200
 weeks. And so you can imagine almost, you know, 1% of our team goes out with 99% of their team,

11:35.200 --> 11:40.320
 then 595, 1090 all the way till it's 5050. And then eventually it rotates and then it's majority

11:40.320 --> 11:45.360
 of our team and a small number of their team. And so what a lot of people will explain is the

11:45.360 --> 11:50.160
 two most dangerous times in war are actually the first two or three weeks and the last two or three

11:50.160 --> 11:53.760
 weeks. When you first get there, you don't know who the people are. You don't know the terrain.

11:53.760 --> 11:57.680
 You don't know, you know, kind of the local cultures and, and, uh, who to look out for,

11:57.680 --> 12:01.680
 what signs, all that kind of stuff. And the last two or three weeks is you basically think you've

12:01.680 --> 12:04.560
 survived the deployment. You're looking forward to going home. So you become complacent, things

12:04.560 --> 12:10.720
 like that. And so we made it through that transition period with no issues. But the literally the very

12:10.720 --> 12:17.920
 first mission that we went out as a team ourselves 100%. There was two separate incidents. One was

12:17.920 --> 12:23.360
 we were driving in the middle of the night. And what we think was a sniper shot at a truck that I

12:23.360 --> 12:28.880
 was in, I was standing up outside of it, along with a another guy. And that was kind of just a

12:28.880 --> 12:34.640
 wake up call again of never been shot up before, right? And so I'll never forget, uh, you kind of

12:34.640 --> 12:39.600
 heard this whiz go by and the guy next to me was from a rural Pennsylvania. And he just said,

12:39.600 --> 12:42.720
 you know, look, I never been shot at before either, but I've done a lot of hunting and get the fuck

12:42.720 --> 12:51.680
 down. Okay. And so, uh, we kept driving that night. Um, and, uh, later on in the night, uh,

12:51.680 --> 12:56.880
 an ID went off. A guy ran over an ID, uh, who was at the front of the convoy. And when that

12:56.880 --> 13:02.160
 ID went off, uh, again, I had never been in a convoy that had been blown up before, but the

13:02.160 --> 13:06.160
 training kicks in. And so immediately every single person starts screaming out ID, ID,

13:06.160 --> 13:10.400
 and they start looking and trying to figure it out. And you realize the United States military

13:10.400 --> 13:15.200
 did a fantastic job training us before we went. Because in that moment, nobody thought about

13:15.200 --> 13:20.480
 anything. You just did what you had been programmed to do. Um, and so ultimately kind of through the

13:20.480 --> 13:24.880
 end of that event, uh, there was you a soldier that ended up dying. He was shot in the head.

13:24.880 --> 13:31.040
 And, um, when we got back to the base, uh, kind of after that entire event, I think it just hit

13:31.040 --> 13:37.280
 us. We are at war. And if we make mistakes here, that is the cost of, you know, kind of those

13:37.280 --> 13:42.560
 mistakes. And this was somebody who I didn't know. Uh, it was somebody who literally showed up,

13:42.560 --> 13:48.960
 uh, kind of as secondary support, uh, for our unit and basically, uh, was there to help us.

13:48.960 --> 13:53.760
 Right. And so it was one of those weird situations where, uh, you have this emotional connection

13:53.760 --> 13:58.720
 because it's somebody who, uh, shared an event with you, but you didn't know them, right? And

13:58.720 --> 14:02.480
 you learned their name later and you understand that they have a family and they have young kids

14:02.480 --> 14:06.560
 and all this stuff. And so again, as a 20 year old kid, you're kind of processing all this and

14:06.560 --> 14:13.360
 you just realize like the gun I have in my, my hands, it's real for a reason, right? And we better

14:13.360 --> 14:17.760
 take this seriously. This is not, you know, let's joking around in kind of the barracks and, you

14:17.760 --> 14:21.440
 know, all the things that you would expect, you know, guys are doing the army. So I think that

14:21.440 --> 14:26.240
 was like the moment where I said, Hey, I'm going to learn a lot here. Uh, and I got to make sure I

14:26.240 --> 14:30.880
 get home. And you snap into the training, but nevertheless, I mean, you're somebody who thinks

14:30.880 --> 14:36.320
 philosophically about this world now, right? You're, uh, very intelligent and things deeply about

14:36.320 --> 14:43.760
 the world. So looking back, you mentioned hatred in the 14 year old kid's eyes. There's death.

14:43.760 --> 14:50.160
 So the way you kind of describe this whole story is like training kicks in this, this shit is serious.

14:50.160 --> 14:56.160
 Like this is, uh, you know, there's a reason there's a gun in your hand. So there's a strategic

14:56.160 --> 15:00.560
 element. There's like, you have to get the job done. There's a task in hand, but at the same time,

15:00.560 --> 15:08.080
 if you zoom out, there's a kid who has hate for you. Uh, some of those kids would probably,

15:08.080 --> 15:14.880
 if they could, would kill you for the thing you stand for in the uniform. And then there's bullets

15:14.880 --> 15:23.360
 flying at you. And then there's people that some of them you might already care for deeply are dying.

15:24.160 --> 15:29.760
 What the hell do you make of that? Do you think about that? Does any of that haunt you?

15:30.960 --> 15:36.720
 How do you think about the world having witnessed that? Yeah. A lot of times when we would talk

15:36.720 --> 15:42.480
 about it, we were there. If I was that kid, I would want to kill that person too, right? I would

15:42.480 --> 15:47.600
 have hatred as well, right? Imagine if in the United States tomorrow you and I woke up and there

15:47.600 --> 15:53.040
 was tanks rolling down the street from another country and they were basically imposing their

15:53.040 --> 15:57.520
 rules on us, whether they thought it was the right thing to do or not. The soldiers were there,

15:57.520 --> 16:02.560
 they were doing this. We would probably feel not so great about it, right? At kind of a minimum

16:02.560 --> 16:06.560
 and at a maximum, we'd be really, really pissed off. We would fight back. And so what you don't

16:06.560 --> 16:11.520
 understand when you're in the heat of the moment is why does this person feel this way? And so

16:11.520 --> 16:17.440
 what's very weird is, well, what happens if a year ago, US soldiers came through,

16:18.000 --> 16:23.600
 they got shot at, they returned fire and they killed that kid's uncle? You'd be pissed off,

16:23.600 --> 16:28.800
 right? And so you just start to understand, like, we look at war very black and white. We look at

16:28.800 --> 16:33.360
 it very much from a clinical perspective. We're going to go, we're going to go kind of invade

16:33.360 --> 16:38.960
 somewhere. We are the most dominant military in the world. We're very good at invading. And we

16:38.960 --> 16:43.360
 will crush wherever we invade. But when you're actually on the ground, what you understand

16:43.360 --> 16:48.640
 is the humanity of it all, right? And so what becomes very interesting is pretty much every

16:48.640 --> 16:53.280
 veteran I know that comes back, they're some of the largest pacifists in the world. And I always

16:53.280 --> 16:59.200
 revert back to Marcus Latrell, who's a famous Navy SEAL, and there's a movie made about him and his

16:59.200 --> 17:05.040
 story. He gave a speech one time that I saw, and he basically said, listen, if you're a politician,

17:05.040 --> 17:10.080
 your job is to be the diplomat, do everything you possibly can not to send me and my friends

17:10.080 --> 17:15.280
 anywhere. Because when you send us, we're going to bring hell with us, right? And understand that

17:15.280 --> 17:20.640
 is the business that we are in. But every single other person up until we get sent has a job to do

17:20.640 --> 17:24.880
 to prevent having to send us. And I think that ultimately, that's where you see a lot of kind

17:24.880 --> 17:30.240
 of this generation that has fought in Iraq and Afghanistan that says, listen, maybe we shouldn't

17:30.240 --> 17:34.480
 be running around the world being the police. Maybe we shouldn't be going and invading all these

17:34.480 --> 17:39.760
 different countries. Because when you actually get to see firsthand what happens, it's just

17:39.760 --> 17:44.800
 something that we should avoid at all costs. But if we have to go, or we have to actually

17:44.800 --> 17:49.840
 send soldiers somewhere, understand what happens when that occurs. And, you know, the United States

17:49.840 --> 17:55.280
 is the best in the world at doing it. Do you think, thinking about that kid with the hatred,

17:55.280 --> 18:00.560
 do you think there will always be hatred in the world? Do you think, from another perspective,

18:00.560 --> 18:05.840
 do you think there will be war always? Is that a fundamental aspect of human nature?

18:05.840 --> 18:07.520
 Or is that something we can escape?

18:07.520 --> 18:12.480
 Jared Ranere Yeah. So war, I think, has like very negative connotations in terms of bullets and

18:12.480 --> 18:20.960
 bombs and death and kind of just very morbid type understanding. Conflict, on the other hand,

18:20.960 --> 18:24.400
 I think people look at and say, of course, there will always be conflict, right? You just can't

18:24.400 --> 18:28.880
 have billions of people all on the same planet without some level of disagreement, whether

18:28.880 --> 18:34.320
 that's a disagreement of ideas, disagreement over physical, you know, geography, or something else.

18:34.320 --> 18:40.400
 And so I think conflict will always exist. The question is, what form does war take moving forward?

18:40.400 --> 18:46.080
 And so, in my mind, you know, it's starting to look a lot more clinical, right? A lot more drones,

18:46.080 --> 18:50.640
 a lot less soldiers on the ground, a lot more use of special forces and kind of these small,

18:50.640 --> 18:55.280
 highly specialized teams rather than kind of big mechanical armies. And then you get into like

18:55.280 --> 19:00.560
 the information warfare and kind of cyber warfare. And you start to understand that we're at war with

19:00.560 --> 19:05.280
 a lot of people right now, right? Doesn't mean we're necessarily dropping bombs on their countries.

19:05.280 --> 19:09.840
 It doesn't necessarily mean we're sending soldiers there. But on a daily basis, we are engaged in

19:09.840 --> 19:14.880
 these kind of, you know, cyber battlefields. And so if that's where war starts to play out,

19:15.600 --> 19:20.960
 it one changes the tools and tactics and techniques that we need to arm our country and other

19:20.960 --> 19:25.440
 countries will arm themselves with. But it also changes the way that we think about war,

19:25.440 --> 19:31.120
 right? It sounds a lot less worrisome if I say, hey, we're going to go to war with a country.

19:31.120 --> 19:35.120
 But by the way, there's going to be no death, right? Okay. Like, that doesn't sound nearly

19:35.120 --> 19:38.640
 as bad as, hey, we're going to go send 10,000 soldiers and, you know, some percentage of them

19:38.640 --> 19:42.000
 are going to die on the battlefield. And then we're going to, you know, basically pipe back

19:42.000 --> 19:45.280
 videos and articles saying that American soldiers are dying.

19:45.280 --> 19:52.080
 Yeah. It does seem to be a fundamental difference between the Genghis Khan style. Like if I would

19:52.080 --> 20:02.320
 feel differently if somebody like hand to hand with a knife murdered my family versus cybersecurity

20:02.320 --> 20:08.000
 where I stole all their data, stole all their money, stole everything they own, falsified

20:08.000 --> 20:15.200
 their identity, all that kind of stuff, that those are both traumatic events. But they do seem to

20:15.200 --> 20:20.800
 be fundamentally different. But maybe that's actually very narrow style thinking. Because

20:21.680 --> 20:28.080
 ultimately you have to think about what is life and what's happiness. And it's like the

20:28.080 --> 20:35.120
 samurai thinking. I'm not sure what's more painful. If I take it to myself, like, I'm not sure what I

20:35.120 --> 20:46.640
 would rather live through being stabbed, like to death, or having my identity stolen, all my money

20:46.640 --> 20:56.000
 stolen, or maybe reputation destroyed, like with lies or something like that. That's very

20:56.000 --> 20:59.440
 interesting to think about. If you think about quality of life and all those kinds of things.

20:59.440 --> 21:05.920
 Well, once finite, right? Once the pain ends, and the other is kind of a prolonged, almost

21:05.920 --> 21:12.000
 torture. So physical pain versus psychological pain. It's really interesting to think about.

21:12.720 --> 21:17.040
 And I think another key piece to this, which I don't have answers to, but there is an element

21:17.040 --> 21:22.960
 of emotion and rage in the physical violence versus, again, more of that clinical information

21:22.960 --> 21:30.960
 warfare. And so it's really easy to show a battlefield where there's death on both sides

21:30.960 --> 21:36.960
 and bombs being dropped and buildings destroyed. It fits very well into propaganda for everyone

21:36.960 --> 21:42.480
 involved, right? Regardless of what side they're on. When you start talking about cyber warfare,

21:42.480 --> 21:47.680
 how many times have we seen a big company get data hacked or information hacked? And we all,

21:47.680 --> 21:51.120
 you know, read the headlines, maybe throw a tweet out and then move on with our day and

21:51.120 --> 21:56.160
 don't remember it anymore. And so it's just very, very different, I think, in the

21:56.160 --> 21:59.360
 motion and response that it invokes in people when they hear about it as well.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.280
 Given the conflict, do you think people are fundamentally good?

22:04.480 --> 22:10.400
 Are we all sort of like blank slates that could be evil given the environment or good

22:10.400 --> 22:16.800
 given the environment? Or can we kind of, is there some base that we can rely on that people,

22:16.800 --> 22:23.600
 if left to their own devices, will be good and trustworthy and honest?

22:23.600 --> 22:30.640
 I think you have to separate out intention from action. So if you talk to some of the most heinous

22:30.640 --> 22:36.080
 criminals in the world, they've rationalized their actions. And so you've got to ask yourself,

22:36.880 --> 22:42.000
 what is the level of which they understood what they were doing that they intended to be

22:42.000 --> 22:49.600
 malicious, nefarious, and kind of do bad things versus the actual actions themselves. And so

22:50.640 --> 22:55.360
 even as a society, you know, if let's say, for example, you were to walk down the street and

22:55.360 --> 22:59.680
 you were to murder somebody on the sidewalk, completely unprovoked, we would look at you and

22:59.680 --> 23:05.440
 say, you are a, you know, a sociopath, you have everything wrong with you. And that is somebody

23:05.440 --> 23:10.960
 that we do not want in our society. And therefore, we will levy, you know, the extent of rule of law

23:10.960 --> 23:15.520
 against you in order to protect society from you, right? And you become that monster, that beast.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.280
 If in the same situation, somebody walks in your house with a knife,

23:19.840 --> 23:25.280
 and you murder them or you kill them, now we put you up on a pedestal as a hero.

23:26.160 --> 23:31.200
 And those are two very, very different responses. They may be just as morbid. They may be just as

23:31.200 --> 23:36.240
 violent. In terms of the actual actions, the intentions, the way it's perceived is very,

23:36.240 --> 23:41.920
 very different. And so I think that as a world, we like a very black and white, clean cut, you

23:41.920 --> 23:47.040
 know, good, bad. I think the world's a lot more messy than that. And I think that a lot of times

23:47.040 --> 23:53.440
 when you look at intention, it's hard for us to tell what somebody's intention is. But I've looked

23:53.440 --> 23:57.280
 at a lot of, you know, people who are both considered very good. And also a lot of people

23:57.280 --> 24:02.000
 are considered very bad. And they sound very similar in terms of the motivations for their

24:02.000 --> 24:06.960
 actions. And so I think that it's just a really hard problem that probably doesn't have a perfect

24:06.960 --> 24:12.000
 solution or an answer. Do you give much value to the intention? Or do you think it's better to

24:12.000 --> 24:20.240
 look at the results of the behavior as opposed to the underlying ideology, the underlying intention

24:20.240 --> 24:25.440
 of the behavior? I think that intention gets at the question of like, are people inherently good

24:25.440 --> 24:31.200
 or bad? Right? Is I think that they're generally inherently good. And the intention is driving

24:31.200 --> 24:36.160
 towards the thing that they believe is the best outcome or the best thing for them to pursue.

24:36.880 --> 24:42.960
 The action I think is where we spend most of our time focused on. And frankly, we actually may be

24:42.960 --> 24:48.560
 a better society or kind of kinder as a humanity to each other if we spent more time looking at

24:48.560 --> 24:53.360
 intention rather than action. But again, you know, if somebody walks down the street and murders

24:53.360 --> 24:58.400
 somebody, it's really hard to have a conversation and it may be inappropriate for us to have a

24:58.400 --> 25:08.000
 conversation about intention versus any level of action, right? So you're one of the prominent,

25:08.000 --> 25:14.240
 I would say even the faces of the world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, that whole entire

25:14.240 --> 25:22.080
 world, let's dive straight in and ask, do you think you consider yourself a Bitcoin maximalist?

25:22.080 --> 25:28.320
 I think that the way I really look at it is I work backwards off of what is the maximalism that I

25:28.320 --> 25:35.920
 believe in, and the world that I believe in is kind of an automated world that is run on these

25:35.920 --> 25:45.200
 open decentralized protocols. And what we ultimately do is we return sovereignty and individualism and

25:45.200 --> 25:52.000
 kind of personal responsibility and liberty to people over institutions. And what we end up doing

25:52.000 --> 25:59.280
 is we end up kind of taking what has historically been a very analog or physical world economy and

25:59.280 --> 26:05.360
 geographic rule, and we then kind of put it in the cloud. And this digital economy becomes the

26:05.360 --> 26:13.200
 prevalent way that we all conduct commerce, communicate, etc. And so it's less about any one

26:13.200 --> 26:20.320
 single technology to me, right? I think that it's pretty stupid for people to almost in a way put

26:20.320 --> 26:28.880
 an inanimate object up for some sort of obsession. To me, it's much more about the ideals, the ethos,

26:28.880 --> 26:35.280
 and the most rational and likely path to that kind of end result or that world that I think is at

26:35.280 --> 26:40.000
 this point just a foregone conclusion. So the distinction there, and maybe people don't know

26:40.000 --> 26:48.240
 the terminology, and maximalism is basically saying, I really think this is a good idea.

26:49.680 --> 26:54.880
 Like, you know, if you prefer a certain kind of diet, you could be a keto maximalist saying like,

26:54.880 --> 27:01.600
 this is probably, maybe he's not 100%, but probably the diet that's healthiest for humans kind of

27:01.600 --> 27:07.920
 thing. In the same sense, Bitcoin maximalism is saying, you know, of course, we don't know,

27:07.920 --> 27:13.120
 there's a lot of uncertainty, but this particular technology seems to be the best representations

27:13.120 --> 27:18.880
 of some set of ideals that defines progress in the future. But you're drawing a distinction between

27:18.880 --> 27:28.560
 sort of cult like obsession about an object of any kind, whether it's keto or Bitcoin,

27:28.560 --> 27:34.720
 and just sort of believing that a technology is the best representation of a particular set of

27:34.720 --> 27:44.160
 ideals. And you believe that sort of this moving into the cloud, both the distributed nature of it,

27:44.160 --> 27:49.840
 but also just the digital nature of it, is something that's going to be a positive step

27:49.840 --> 27:54.720
 for humanity. Yeah, I would even take maximalism a step further. And it's not just the kind of

27:54.720 --> 28:01.200
 singular viewpoint of this is the best. It's also an element of it's anti everything else.

28:01.200 --> 28:06.720
 Right. So, you know, take keto, for example, the keto diet is not only the best diet,

28:06.720 --> 28:11.360
 all the other diets are bad. Yeah, right. And so it's a very binary view of the world.

28:11.920 --> 28:17.840
 I think that what's probably most misunderstood about, let's take Bitcoin as a specific example,

28:17.840 --> 28:21.280
 is that most of the people who are labeled Bitcoin maximalist,

28:22.080 --> 28:26.400
 they would be open minded if they believe that something else came along that was a superior

28:26.400 --> 28:32.880
 technology or had a better kind of probability of achieving, again, that ultimate vision. I think

28:32.880 --> 28:40.000
 where there's this controversy and kind of clashing of ideas is that the Bitcoin community

28:40.000 --> 28:45.840
 believes Bitcoin is the best way to do that and has very specific arguments as to why the other

28:45.840 --> 28:50.880
 things are not. Right. And so what ultimately ends up happening, which is very weird in the

28:50.880 --> 28:54.240
 investing world, right? It's unlikely that you and I are going to sit down, you're going to buy

28:54.240 --> 28:58.000
 Apple stock is the best stock and there's no other stock that's worth anything. Yeah, right.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.920
 And then also, it's very weird if you said to me, you know, this stock is worth zero and that's

29:03.920 --> 29:09.440
 where everything that I own, I've put on a short on one single company, right? There's diversification,

29:09.440 --> 29:14.960
 there's a much more kind of probabilistic thinking and finance in general. When it comes to this

29:14.960 --> 29:20.160
 specific world of cryptocurrency and kind of digital assets, if you will, is there's two

29:20.160 --> 29:25.680
 main groups of people who are trying to build two very, very different things at the onset.

29:26.240 --> 29:29.760
 But when you unpack it and you start to spend more and more time on it, you rise, they're actually

29:29.760 --> 29:34.800
 trying to accomplish the same thing in two different ways. So Bitcoin is seen, I think, as a digital

29:34.800 --> 29:38.880
 currency, right? Kind of the idea that this is going to ascend to become the next global reserve

29:38.880 --> 29:45.600
 currency. It's a programmatic kind of transparent money. And it's essentially just 180 degrees

29:45.600 --> 29:50.720
 difference than the inflationary, you know, non transparent fiat currencies that exist in the

29:50.720 --> 29:55.280
 world. You then look at kind of everything else, right? And you have a lot of smart contract

29:55.280 --> 29:59.200
 platforms and various things that they're all going after, right? Ethereum with kind of the

29:59.200 --> 30:02.960
 world computer approach, and you can kind of go down the line with all their other arguments is

30:02.960 --> 30:08.560
 what they're trying to build. I think the big difference just comes down to innovation for

30:08.560 --> 30:16.160
 security. And when you simplistically look at it via that lens, you actually understand where

30:16.160 --> 30:20.160
 both people are coming from. When you say security side to interrupt, do you mean financial security

30:20.160 --> 30:26.960
 or do you mean like literally the security of the particular cryptocurrency? The technical

30:26.960 --> 30:32.320
 security of a blockchain. So when you look at, let's say, Bitcoin versus Ethereum, right? Bitcoin

30:32.320 --> 30:36.640
 has decided and that community has decided security is the number one thing that you have to optimize

30:36.640 --> 30:44.400
 for. So decentralization over everything else in terms of transaction speeds, cost, anything that

30:44.400 --> 30:48.800
 you could come up with that is something that would be important for a currency, the number one

30:48.800 --> 30:53.840
 thing to optimize for is security. And as we have seen with a lot of technologies, right,

30:53.840 --> 30:59.360
 Facebook's Libre or now what's known as DM is a great example, not having decentralization

30:59.360 --> 31:06.800
 is susceptible to the nation state. And so a lot of these other platforms and blockchains,

31:07.520 --> 31:11.920
 they say security is important, but it's not the most important thing. We believe there's a trade

31:11.920 --> 31:18.800
 off between a little less security and transaction speed or composability or whatever it is. And so

31:18.800 --> 31:24.400
 take Ethereum as kind of the second largest community and blockchain by market cap.

31:24.400 --> 31:28.960
 It was created because somebody wanted to or a group of people wanted to do something on

31:28.960 --> 31:31.760
 Bitcoin, they felt like they couldn't do it. And so they said, hey, we're going to go create

31:31.760 --> 31:36.080
 something that has the smart contracts that we can then go do here. Again, this is technology,

31:36.080 --> 31:40.640
 right? So the tribalism of like, you're right, you're wrong, to me is a little childish, just in

31:40.640 --> 31:45.200
 the sense of like the market is going to decide what is most valuable. And then when you go inside

31:45.200 --> 31:48.720
 of that community, like there's a lot of dumb ideas people are trying to build around Bitcoin.

31:48.720 --> 31:51.680
 But there's also a lot of really, really great ideas that people are trying to build around

31:51.680 --> 31:56.880
 Bitcoin. Same thing in the Ethereum world. And so what you end up getting I think is the tribalism

31:56.880 --> 32:01.760
 really comes out of the idea that there's a ticker price that is attached to all of this, right?

32:01.760 --> 32:08.240
 If you go back in history of technology, venture capitalists didn't sit around the table and yell

32:08.240 --> 32:13.040
 and scream at each other in this like religious zealot way, right? Because you bet on one type

32:13.040 --> 32:17.280
 of cloud computing platform and I bet on another one, right? Just the market's going to decide

32:17.280 --> 32:22.240
 we're both going to work on and try to make ours successful. Here, I think that the sensitivity

32:22.240 --> 32:27.600
 and mainly comes out of the Bitcoin community is that a lot of this is being funded not only by

32:27.600 --> 32:32.480
 venture capitalists and kind of professional money managers and asset allocators. There's also

32:32.480 --> 32:37.600
 this element of including the retail investor and the public. And so it, whether it's through

32:37.600 --> 32:43.120
 ICOs or some other forms of capital raising, there's arguments for it saying, hey, look,

32:43.120 --> 32:48.960
 this now gives kind of the little guy some sort of access and ability to do it. But there's also

32:48.960 --> 32:53.040
 arguments against it. Some people say, hey, it's easier to dupe them and it's easier to run scams

32:53.040 --> 32:58.960
 and kind of all this stuff. And so ultimately, I think that crypto is this like arena of ideas.

32:58.960 --> 33:04.320
 It is literally the war of attrition. And what will end up happening is 10 years from now,

33:04.320 --> 33:09.360
 you and I will talk. And we're going to say, well, the market said X was valuable and Y wasn't.

33:09.360 --> 33:15.680
 And so all of the tribalism from between here and there, it's fun. It's engaging, whatever.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.800
 But ultimately, it doesn't really matter. Yeah, because the public is involved. There's a lot

33:18.800 --> 33:25.200
 of personalities. And so a lot of times we focus on the extreme personalities that do a lot of

33:25.200 --> 33:31.200
 maybe part in the French shit talking. And so we kind of focus on that. But that's not necessarily

33:31.200 --> 33:35.600
 representative of the communities involved. Let's talk about Bitcoin first, and then it'll help us

33:35.600 --> 33:40.800
 use as a kind of a comparison to Ethereum or whatever else. So when you think about what is

33:40.800 --> 33:44.160
 money, right, that's kind of the first question people really kind of go down the rabbit hole on.

33:44.160 --> 33:49.520
 And ultimately today, it's a belief system, right? And you may believe that one currency has more

33:49.520 --> 33:54.720
 value over another because it's backed by a certain military or a certain government has a

33:54.720 --> 33:58.960
 monetary policy that you believe in or don't believe in. But ultimately, it's a belief system

33:58.960 --> 34:03.920
 that there's nothing backing this other than a government asks you to pay your taxes in it,

34:03.920 --> 34:07.760
 right? And they can have a monopoly on violence in terms of they can put you in jail if you don't

34:07.760 --> 34:11.680
 pay your taxes, they can go to other countries and they can invade and do all this stuff.

34:13.600 --> 34:19.360
 It wasn't always like that, right? It was historically a layer one technology was gold.

34:19.360 --> 34:24.720
 And so gold was a fantastic store of value. You knew that if you held gold, it wasn't going to be

34:24.720 --> 34:29.120
 inflated away with sound money was outside the system and no one could create more of it. The

34:29.120 --> 34:33.840
 reason why that's important is because that optimization for store of value served as the

34:33.840 --> 34:41.520
 bedrock of the entire stack of money for 5000 years. And so the problem with that though,

34:41.520 --> 34:46.000
 again, tradeoff between store of value is it was really hard to transact with, right? If I came in

34:46.000 --> 34:50.480
 here and you said, hey, I want a couple of ounces of gold and I had a whole bar, I'd have to literally

34:50.480 --> 34:56.320
 shave off the ounces of gold. It's heavy to carry around. If you said to me, hey, you're in one city,

34:56.320 --> 35:00.560
 mail it to me. It's really expensive. You know, there's all these issues with it. And so ultimately

35:00.560 --> 35:05.280
 what people said was, well, let's create a second layer on top of that gold in order to make it easier

35:05.280 --> 35:09.520
 to transact. And so we created paper claims on the gold. So hey, don't carry around the gold in

35:09.520 --> 35:14.320
 your pocket anymore, put it in a vault or a bank, they're going to issue a paper claim. Now you and

35:14.320 --> 35:18.000
 I can trade these paper claims around. And at any point if you want the gold, you just show up and

35:18.000 --> 35:23.200
 you say, hey, give me three ounces of gold or two bars or whatever. And so that actually made

35:23.200 --> 35:27.360
 the store a value. It allowed that to be the anchor and kind of the most important part, the

35:27.360 --> 35:31.440
 security of your purchasing power. But now it became easier to transact. And then eventually

35:31.440 --> 35:36.000
 we built layers even on top of that. So everything from electronic money, kind of electronic QCIPs,

35:36.000 --> 35:40.800
 all the way to credit and other systems on top of that gold. 1971 comes around and obviously we

35:40.800 --> 35:45.280
 dpeg from that gold, right? And it was a temporary measure at the time. We ended up not going back

35:45.280 --> 35:49.760
 to it. And so what you moved or transitioned from was sound money, which was outside the system,

35:49.760 --> 35:53.520
 no one could create more. To now the government had full control. They could create as much as

35:53.520 --> 35:57.680
 they wanted to. They tried to be responsible and disciplined, but obviously hard to do. Sometimes

35:57.680 --> 36:00.800
 we've been really good at it. Sometimes we've been less good at it. And then you go around the world

36:00.800 --> 36:04.880
 and some countries have absolutely sucked at it and some have been good at it. And so when you

36:04.880 --> 36:09.760
 look into the Bitcoin world, I think that when you look at the optimization for security,

36:09.760 --> 36:14.720
 similar to gold, store value, people hold it, purchasing power has gone up a lot year over

36:14.720 --> 36:19.520
 year. It's like a 200% year over year compounded annual growth for over a decade,

36:19.520 --> 36:23.920
 right? And so you measure this in kind of the US dollar exchange price, etc. But there's still a

36:23.920 --> 36:29.200
 lot of people who will yell and scream about it's slow, it's costly, all the things around those

36:29.200 --> 36:34.800
 transactions that are obstacles or challenges. And so there's basically two schools of thought.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.720
 And this is where we kind of get into the bifurcation. Some people just said, hey,

36:38.720 --> 36:43.520
 this technology is antiquated. We can't use it. It doesn't make sense. And so what we're going to

36:43.520 --> 36:47.520
 do is we're going to go build something new. And so you go get kind of all of the various versions

36:47.520 --> 36:53.040
 there. The Bitcoin community says no, just like gold had paper claims and other things built on

36:53.040 --> 36:56.880
 top and layer two, three, four, five, we're going to do that here. And so they've already started

36:56.880 --> 37:01.600
 to build kind of this layer two, where it's easier to transact, it's cheaper, it's faster, etc.

37:02.240 --> 37:07.600
 And so I actually think that both of those worlds are going to coexist in the future.

37:07.600 --> 37:13.120
 The big question is just which one has more importance, right? So again, get out of binary,

37:13.120 --> 37:19.360
 it's just probabilistically. And so my personal belief is that the security, that the store of

37:19.360 --> 37:25.600
 value component as the bedrock for a monetary system is essential, right? Like that is the most

37:25.600 --> 37:30.800
 important thing, because you can always improve the other components, but you can't go back and fix

37:30.800 --> 37:38.400
 that kind of core piece. So money is an idea that we all, it's like an emergent idea that we believe

37:38.400 --> 37:45.600
 in. You're saying that security is one of the most fundamental catalysts or fuels for that idea to

37:45.600 --> 37:52.800
 sort of take hold and be stable and sort of take over the world. The other stuff is really nice to

37:52.800 --> 37:58.160
 have, but if you don't have the security, you're not going to, like it's not going to spread in the

37:58.160 --> 38:05.120
 viral sense in our human brains. Well, and especially in light of kind of the macroeconomy,

38:05.120 --> 38:11.360
 right? So like what's so fascinating about the last 12 months is in investing in general,

38:11.360 --> 38:16.240
 the best return trying to kind of put that near quotes a little bit is something that is different

38:16.240 --> 38:21.680
 than everything else and right. So being different and wrong just means you're an idiot, right?

38:21.680 --> 38:25.920
 Being different and right means that that's where kind of the outsized returns are. And so if you

38:25.920 --> 38:31.040
 look around the world at currencies today, they're all the same. They're all inflationary, unlimited

38:31.040 --> 38:37.120
 supply controlled by a government and decisions made in a very non transparent process. And what

38:37.120 --> 38:42.240
 we've watched is the manipulation of all of those currencies over the last 12 months. In direct

38:42.240 --> 38:48.160
 contrast to that is this thing, Bitcoin, which is outside of the system, has a finite supply,

38:48.160 --> 38:53.200
 transparent and programmatic monetary policy. And so when you see those two systems kind of

38:53.840 --> 38:58.320
 in comparison to each other in the United States, there's a lot of people who say the dollar works

38:58.320 --> 39:03.040
 great for me. I can go to the ATM, I can get out physical cash. If I want to swipe a card, I could

39:03.040 --> 39:08.720
 do that. My money in my bank doesn't lose 50% of its value in a day in terms of purchasing power.

39:08.720 --> 39:13.200
 Like the dollar's pretty good. When you go to other countries, that might not be the case.

39:13.840 --> 39:18.880
 And so I do think that there's kind of a relative analysis that goes on here. If you compare Bitcoin

39:18.880 --> 39:23.120
 to the dollar, there's all kinds of arguments to make that the dollar is better as a medium of

39:23.120 --> 39:28.560
 exchange today. But if I go and I tell you what about in these kind of extreme examples of

39:29.120 --> 39:33.760
 Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Turkey, et cetera. And so I think that that's kind of one

39:33.760 --> 39:38.960
 perspective to view this through is security versus all of the innovative components of

39:38.960 --> 39:42.880
 a medium of exchange, et cetera. The second thing, though, that I think is really, really

39:42.880 --> 39:48.880
 important is around censorship. And so when you look at, again, every currency in the world today,

39:48.880 --> 39:54.080
 every single financial service, they're highly susceptible to censorship. And actually,

39:54.080 --> 39:58.880
 I would argue the United States is in the business of censorship in terms of how many

39:58.880 --> 40:04.960
 countries around the world do we sanction and cut them off in either a minimal or a

40:04.960 --> 40:07.440
 very material way from the global financial system.

40:07.440 --> 40:11.280
 So when you talk about censorship, do you mean just the

40:12.400 --> 40:14.800
 censoring your ability to operate freely in the world?

40:14.800 --> 40:20.640
 Well, look at it a little bit differently, which is that the United States has kind of the American

40:20.640 --> 40:24.960
 superiority. Because we have the bombs, the bullets, the soldiers, and that military might,

40:25.520 --> 40:33.600
 we basically impose our will around the world. And so there's a very strong argument to be made

40:33.600 --> 40:38.160
 that there are certain countries around the world that are being sanctioned, that the people of

40:38.160 --> 40:42.960
 those countries did nothing wrong. Now, the governments are bad, right, in terms of the

40:42.960 --> 40:49.440
 way that you and I would look at democratic rule or communism or whatever it is. But the people

40:49.440 --> 40:53.440
 are being hurt as well. So there's a whole group of people who would have just argued, listen,

40:53.440 --> 40:58.160
 we shouldn't hurt anyone at the expense of punishing one person or a group of people.

40:58.800 --> 41:03.120
 There's other people who argue against that. But I do think that if you really kind of

41:03.120 --> 41:07.040
 zoom out and you say, I'm going to take myself out of the Western worldview,

41:07.040 --> 41:09.760
 and I'm simply going to look at this as we're all part of the human race,

41:09.760 --> 41:15.360
 it's censorship. And there might be an argument for censorship, but there also might be an argument

41:15.360 --> 41:21.760
 against the censorship. And so what Bitcoin does as that specific kind of payment network is it

41:21.760 --> 41:25.600
 says anyone in the world with an internet connection, I don't care where you are born,

41:25.600 --> 41:29.360
 what language you speak, what religion you are, your wealth status, your education status,

41:30.240 --> 41:34.800
 none of it matters. If you have an internet connection, you can plug into this monetary

41:34.800 --> 41:39.680
 system, and you can move value around the world to anyone else without asking for permission.

41:40.560 --> 41:45.600
 And in the United States, we basically have that ability in the US dollar kind of traditional

41:45.600 --> 41:48.960
 banking system, I can pretty much send money to almost anyone I want, unless they're a really bad

41:48.960 --> 41:53.600
 person that's on some list or something. Most people in the world don't have that capability.

41:54.160 --> 41:59.920
 And so what you're essentially doing is you're democratizing access to a true store value

41:59.920 --> 42:07.920
 and a medium of exchange. And so what you see in many of these countries is that when their currency

42:07.920 --> 42:14.320
 starts to fail, the first thing that a government or a group of people in power and influence do

42:14.320 --> 42:21.120
 is they lock the citizens into the currency with capital controls. Why? Because if you let them out,

42:21.120 --> 42:28.240
 it exasperates the problem. And so now what we're seeing is we basically are giving a tool

42:28.240 --> 42:36.000
 to billions of people around the world that is a peaceful protest. You and I had no say at all when

42:36.000 --> 42:38.880
 not only the Federal Reserve and elected officials here in the United States,

42:38.880 --> 42:42.400
 but central banks around the world over the last 12 months decided to create

42:42.400 --> 42:47.040
 trillions of dollars and inject it into the monetary system. They have arguments and some

42:47.040 --> 42:49.920
 of them are very good arguments as to why they should do that. They're trying to mitigate short

42:49.920 --> 42:56.000
 term pain. Long term, they'll figure out the other issues. They have very kind of elaborate and well

42:56.000 --> 43:01.920
 articulated kind of viewpoint as to why they're doing it. But you and I had no say. And so when

43:01.920 --> 43:06.880
 you start to look at, we have a very small group of people in this world, both in our country

43:06.880 --> 43:11.200
 and in countries around the world, that make these decisions that have very, very far reaching

43:12.000 --> 43:17.600
 kind of impact. And on top of that, in many cases, there's actually not that much kind of

43:17.600 --> 43:21.520
 accountability because usually these are not elected officials who are making some of these

43:21.520 --> 43:26.480
 decisions. These are appointed. And you can argue that, hey, we elected somebody who appointed them.

43:26.480 --> 43:31.440
 But at the same time, that accountability isn't quite there. And so I think ultimately when you

43:31.440 --> 43:34.800
 just back out, you say, you know, what is Bitcoin? Why is it important to the world?

43:35.600 --> 43:40.400
 It is giving access to anyone in the world with an internet connection to a store of value

43:40.400 --> 43:46.480
 and a monetary network that allows them to peacefully protest and to opt out of a system

43:46.480 --> 43:52.560
 that pretty much is not working for majority of people in the world. So it's moving the power

43:52.560 --> 44:01.200
 from these centralized places, sometimes unelected to the individuals and to the people. So the dollar

44:01.200 --> 44:07.680
 does seem to work for Americans and for many people in the world. But you kind of have a vision.

44:07.680 --> 44:12.160
 You paint a picture of a future where potentially we move to cryptocurrency. So

44:12.160 --> 44:17.840
 what kind of trajectory do you see where Bitcoin can become the main currency in the world, or at

44:17.840 --> 44:23.600
 least cryptocurrency become the main way of storing value in the world and basically overtake the

44:23.600 --> 44:29.840
 dollar? Yeah. So I always go first to, we don't need to have competition, like in terms of like a

44:29.840 --> 44:35.840
 direct competition between the dollar and Bitcoin, right? If you look at most technologies in the

44:35.840 --> 44:40.800
 world, the really valuable ones are actually market expanding technologies, rather than

44:40.800 --> 44:46.320
 simply just market share stealing technologies, right? So if you look at Uber, for example, Uber

44:46.320 --> 44:50.560
 didn't just say, hey, I'm going to go take out all the taxis, right? It actually drastically expanded

44:50.560 --> 44:54.080
 the market for people. Now there's literally millions of people in the United States who don't

44:54.080 --> 44:59.920
 have cars because they use Uber, right? And so I think that Bitcoin is very similar in that, yes,

44:59.920 --> 45:04.960
 there is a component of medium of exchange in terms of the dollar, but also there is this

45:04.960 --> 45:10.000
 component of just store of value assets in general. And so when you start to look at Bitcoin's

45:10.000 --> 45:14.800
 specifically, I think that what you're seeing is you're seeing a generational gap where young

45:14.800 --> 45:19.760
 people say, I grew up with a phone in my hand. I'm digitally native. The whole idea of going to the

45:19.760 --> 45:25.120
 bank and sending a wire or going to an ATM and getting physical cash is an antiquated idea in

45:25.120 --> 45:29.520
 their mind, right? I one time asked my brother, he's 24 years old. And I said, Hey, how do you send

45:29.520 --> 45:33.920
 money to your friends? And then he gave me one answer, which I expected, which was Venmo. And

45:33.920 --> 45:38.320
 the second answer I didn't expect, he said, Uber. I said, how do you send money via Uber? He said,

45:38.320 --> 45:43.200
 well, we get in a car together. And at the end, we split the ride. And so again, you and I have

45:43.200 --> 45:47.200
 probably both done that. But I never thought of it as a way to send money to each other. And so

45:47.200 --> 45:53.040
 it is a psychological difference between even me, who's only, you know, a decade older than him or

45:53.040 --> 45:59.360
 so, and his peer group. And so I think as we're watching kind of Bitcoin continue this ascent,

45:59.360 --> 46:04.880
 ultimately, what we're seeing is an entire generation of kids are saying, listen, if I look at

46:04.880 --> 46:09.360
 financial assets across the board, I have stocks, I have bonds, I have currencies, and I have

46:09.360 --> 46:16.400
 commodities, I know that bonds from a real rate return perspective is flat to negative, right?

46:16.400 --> 46:22.240
 I'm going to make no money on this because I have a belief that my dollar is being devalued. And

46:22.240 --> 46:27.200
 actually what we're starting to see is again, the internet has broken down these walled gardens

46:27.200 --> 46:32.320
 and kind of these centralized hubs of information in that if you were to look at, let's say the

46:32.320 --> 46:38.400
 stock market from 1971 to today, in dollar terms, it's a 45 degree angle right up into the right,

46:38.400 --> 46:43.040
 right? You know, it's kind of seven, eight, 10% growth every year. And it's amazing. Just get

46:43.040 --> 46:45.920
 invested in the stock market and you'll make money over a long period of time, regardless of the

46:45.920 --> 46:51.520
 dips along the way. If you denominate that same stock market in gold, the stock market is down

46:51.520 --> 46:57.920
 since 1971. And so is it so much that the stock market is accruing true value? Or is it that the

46:57.920 --> 47:02.880
 underlying currency in which it is denominated in is being devalued, right? And I was being

47:02.880 --> 47:07.840
 devalued in a very disciplined way, right? In terms of it's not like it went 50% devaluation

47:07.840 --> 47:12.240
 in a short period of time, but it's still being devalued. And so I think that people are waking

47:12.240 --> 47:17.520
 up to this idea that a traditional 6040 type global portfolio doesn't work anymore, right?

47:17.520 --> 47:23.760
 40% of it in bonds is just not going to get it done. And so when you start to look at this,

47:23.760 --> 47:29.600
 people first look at Bitcoin via two main ways in my opinion. They look at it. One is a store

47:29.600 --> 47:33.920
 value. Should I actually go and put some of my wealth there? Use it as a savings technology,

47:33.920 --> 47:38.960
 right? We ask people in the traditional world, if you're a teacher, a fireman, an accounting,

47:38.960 --> 47:44.080
 you know, mid level manager, we say, hey, go do your job. Be best in class as a fireman or as a

47:44.080 --> 47:47.600
 teacher. And then oh, by the way, you have to be a professional investor as well. Because if you

47:47.600 --> 47:52.320
 just put your dollars in your bank account, you're literally going to have your wealth devalued away

47:52.320 --> 47:58.160
 over time. So you can't just save, you have to invest. That is a really tall task for people.

47:58.160 --> 48:01.840
 They have a hard enough time just doing their job, right? Taking care of their family, right?

48:01.840 --> 48:06.080
 Now they're going to be an investor. So I think saving technology for a Bitcoin standpoint is

48:06.080 --> 48:12.480
 if you buy Satoshi's or Bitcoin, over time, it will increase from a purchasing power standpoint

48:12.480 --> 48:17.200
 because there's a fixed supply and demand continues to rise. But then you start to look at, well,

48:17.200 --> 48:22.400
 what other assets do people put in their portfolios, whether it's art, it's real estate,

48:22.400 --> 48:27.600
 it's precious metals, or something else? Most of those assets are not because people actually

48:27.600 --> 48:32.720
 think that they're going to go up in value over time. They're using the store value, right? The

48:32.720 --> 48:37.520
 reason why somebody buys gold is because the store value, right? Historically, that's a narrative

48:37.520 --> 48:43.440
 driven type asset, though, right? We tell people it's scarce. We tell people that it is a store

48:43.440 --> 48:48.080
 value. When you look at it, though, we don't know how much gold exists in the world. We have a good

48:48.080 --> 48:52.240
 estimate, right? But we don't actually, we can't prove how much there is. We don't know how much

48:52.240 --> 48:57.440
 is coming out of the ground every day. Again, great, fantastic estimate, but we can't prove it.

48:57.440 --> 49:00.320
 And we don't know what the total supply is. And that's what you mean by narrative driven. We can't

49:00.320 --> 49:05.360
 really prove it mathematically. UI and everyone else in the world has lived in a narrative driven

49:05.360 --> 49:10.240
 world for the last couple of decades, right? And what the internet and digital technologies have

49:10.240 --> 49:17.280
 done is it opened up the possibility and the desire from people to have a world now where I can

49:17.280 --> 49:24.320
 validate things. So when I see that headline, I want to see you say whatever happened in the news,

49:24.320 --> 49:28.640
 if you're the subject of the news, rather than have somebody else tell me the story. If I see

49:28.640 --> 49:34.240
 that you say something is scarce, prove to me that it is scarce. And so I think that's kind of a

49:34.240 --> 49:38.400
 psychological shift the younger generation is starting to understand. Because ultimately,

49:38.400 --> 49:41.840
 you and I probably grew up in a world where our parents could tell us a story and we just believed

49:41.840 --> 49:46.880
 it. You know, dad or mom says it, it must be true. If my brother heard a story, what does he do?

49:46.880 --> 49:50.400
 He goes to Google and he looks it up, right? He comes back and usually tells my parents how

49:50.400 --> 49:55.680
 you got the story wrong, right? And so I think that that, that provability or that, that validation

49:55.680 --> 49:59.520
 ends up becoming really, really important. And so, you know, look at something like gold. I think

49:59.520 --> 50:06.400
 that people are drastically underestimating the shift that's underway right now. Gold is one down

50:06.400 --> 50:13.600
 in value since April, I'm sorry, August of 2020. And so in a timeframe where central banks have

50:13.600 --> 50:18.400
 had historic quantitative easing, literally $6 trillion in the United States, the one asset

50:18.400 --> 50:23.280
 that historically has been the best store of value and has, you know, in 2008 financial crisis,

50:23.280 --> 50:29.760
 hit an all time high based on the government response, has actually suffered for a main

50:29.760 --> 50:34.720
 part of this financial crisis. You then look at central banks around the world who have been

50:34.720 --> 50:40.640
 very large holders of gold for a long time and net buyers on a monthly basis. For multiple months,

50:40.640 --> 50:45.920
 over the last six months, they've been net sellers of gold. And then you start to look at

50:45.920 --> 50:53.040
 jewelry demand, so the actual non monetary value of gold. And that demand for gold jewelry peaked

50:53.040 --> 50:58.400
 in 2013, and has continued to fall since. And so what you start to say to yourself is take

50:58.400 --> 51:03.440
 just the asset of gold, which about $10 trillion market cap. And you say, okay, well, jewelry

51:03.440 --> 51:07.440
 demand continues to fall, even if it's at a slight rate, but it's continues to contract.

51:07.440 --> 51:12.080
 You have central banks that now at sometimes are net sellers and sometimes net buyers, right? So,

51:12.080 --> 51:17.840
 okay, again, contraction there. And then from the investment standpoint, the actual price that the

51:17.840 --> 51:23.200
 daily price of this continues to fall, which is a signal that there's a contracting demand from

51:23.200 --> 51:29.760
 an investment perspective. That's 93% of all use of gold, only 7% of its use for actual technology

51:29.760 --> 51:35.200
 and metal conduction and things like that. And so you have a $10 trillion asset that it appears,

51:35.200 --> 51:38.560
 and again, maybe data changes and I'll change my mind and other people change their mind,

51:38.560 --> 51:42.800
 but it appears is on the decline. And so if that happens, you're going to get the contraction of

51:42.800 --> 51:48.000
 a $10 trillion asset. Where's all that value go? And what you're seeing is at the same time that

51:48.000 --> 51:55.120
 that asset is contracting, you're also seeing a massive influx from not only retail investors,

51:55.120 --> 52:00.720
 not only kind of the wealthy and the elite, but also from financial institutions, corporations,

52:00.720 --> 52:04.400
 pension funds, et cetera, into this kind of digital sound money.

52:04.400 --> 52:09.600
 So you're saying that there's a kind of shift from gold to Bitcoin, because they have a lot of the

52:09.600 --> 52:14.720
 same properties except the one is in the physical space, the other is in the digital space. So do

52:14.720 --> 52:24.080
 you see like central banks quietly potentially switching out from sort of gold to Bitcoin?

52:24.080 --> 52:30.400
 Like naturally, just seeing the pattern that you're referring to now, but more drastically

52:30.400 --> 52:34.960
 into the future where there's a complete shift. If you line up the gold community and the Bitcoin

52:34.960 --> 52:40.080
 community next to each other, they'll agree on all the problems that they see in the world, right?

52:40.880 --> 52:43.840
 They'll actually agree on the solution that sound money is the solution.

52:44.720 --> 52:50.080
 Where they differentiate is the gold community believes that it's the analog application of

52:50.080 --> 52:54.640
 sound money, right? The physical gold, that is the solution. The Bitcoin community believes

52:54.640 --> 52:58.480
 the digital application of sound money, Bitcoin. Can you define sound money, by the way?

52:58.480 --> 53:02.240
 Sound money is just outside the system and no one can create more of it. So nobody controls it.

53:02.240 --> 53:06.400
 This is scarcity is fundamental. Exactly. Why is scarcity important in money?

53:06.960 --> 53:11.520
 Well, I think scarcity just has this very high correlation to value across all assets,

53:11.520 --> 53:16.000
 not just money, right? Money happens to be the unit of account that we use in terms of

53:16.000 --> 53:23.520
 daily commerce, but whether it is, as we're seeing now, sneakers, art, whatever it is,

53:24.080 --> 53:29.440
 scarcity ultimately is that signal of value, I think, and that's just been the way that humans

53:30.160 --> 53:33.040
 derive value for literally thousands and thousands of years.

53:33.040 --> 53:39.120
 Yeah, I got to say, that's my view on life and love in general is scarcity is what makes it

53:39.120 --> 53:45.680
 valuable. People talk about immortality. I would like to be immortal, but it does

53:45.680 --> 53:56.640
 seem that when you let go of the fight netness of life, I feel like that meals and the experiences

53:56.640 --> 54:03.760
 you have get devalued significantly. Like the longer you live, the less value there are in

54:03.760 --> 54:09.520
 infinity. If you live forever, I worry that all the meaning will dissipate. And the same thing

54:09.520 --> 54:16.480
 with love, a quick criticism of dating culture and all that kind of stuff. I haven't had shocking

54:16.480 --> 54:21.760
 revelation that I've never been on attended data or any of those things. I believe that scarcity

54:21.760 --> 54:28.960
 and dating and interaction intensifies the value of when the interactions do happen,

54:28.960 --> 54:36.000
 so when love does happen. So in that sense, there's something magical about scarcity in the

54:36.000 --> 54:41.440
 more subjective psychological social world as well. And perhaps money is just another version

54:41.440 --> 54:45.520
 of that. It's all about the stories and ideas we tell ourselves.

54:45.520 --> 54:49.440
 I think they're actually more interconnected than you're giving it credit for, which is

54:50.000 --> 54:58.800
 what is money? Money is time ultimately. The pursuit of the acquisition of money,

54:58.800 --> 55:05.840
 of whether it's a currency or true money, is because that should give you more time. And so

55:05.840 --> 55:11.680
 one of my favorite movies ever, and it's funny because Justin Timberlake is in it, is this movie

55:11.680 --> 55:18.800
 In Time. I lose most people at that point. In Time. And basically the premise of the movie is that

55:18.800 --> 55:25.280
 everyone has a clock that's embedded into their arm. And so if you go to work, you basically

55:25.280 --> 55:29.520
 put your arm underneath when you leave and there's time that's deposited into your clock. And if your

55:29.520 --> 55:35.760
 clock ever hits all zeros, you're dead. You die on the spot. And so there's a number of scenes

55:35.760 --> 55:39.920
 where people are basically running to get to you and I give you a little bit more time so that

55:39.920 --> 55:44.400
 you can get to work on Monday and then you work to acquire time. And so basically time becomes

55:44.400 --> 55:50.720
 this currency. But what becomes very fascinating about it is there are sections in society where

55:50.720 --> 55:56.480
 literally there's physical places. If you only have, let's say 72 hours or less, you're allowed

55:56.480 --> 56:01.360
 to go to section one. Section five, though, is because you have years and years and years on

56:01.360 --> 56:09.600
 your clock. And in this movie, everyone at the age of 25 freezes from a biological aging standpoint.

56:09.600 --> 56:14.720
 So everyone stays the same, but you may have lived for 1000 years. And so what becomes so

56:14.720 --> 56:21.440
 fascinating about it is that rich people have time, poor people do not have time. And so

56:21.440 --> 56:26.960
 in it, Justin Timberlake, the main character at one point, essentially acquires a bunch of time

56:26.960 --> 56:32.000
 and he's able to go to one of the higher levels. And now he's attending all these

56:32.000 --> 56:37.120
 gallows and, you know, poker nights and all the stuff. And one of the first things that he learns

56:37.120 --> 56:43.120
 is that in the lower end of society, everyone is running everywhere at all times in the movie.

56:43.120 --> 56:48.160
 Because time is so finite and it is so scarce. And so therefore, why would I walk down the street?

56:48.160 --> 56:54.960
 I must run down the street. In the highest level of society, no one runs anywhere. And in fact,

56:54.960 --> 57:02.400
 if you run, you are seen as lower class because wealth is time. And so that movie is, you know,

57:02.400 --> 57:06.800
 it's got a ton of kind of things that you can pull out of it. But to me is the perfect epitome

57:06.800 --> 57:14.000
 of money is time. And so when you start to think about the acquisition of money, right,

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
 it goes to this whole idea of time billionaire. And I know that there's probably a lot of people

57:18.000 --> 57:26.240
 have heard about this already. But if you think of a million seconds, it's about 11 days. A billion

57:26.240 --> 57:33.520
 seconds is 31 years. And so if I said to somebody, you have to switch lives with Warren Buffett,

57:33.520 --> 57:38.960
 Warren Buffett, would you do it? Some people would say, sure, that'd be their initial reaction.

57:38.960 --> 57:44.800
 I said, but you got to have to be, you know, 92 years old. Is the money worth the lack of time?

57:45.360 --> 57:49.760
 Most people would say no, right? And there's this guy, Graham Duncan, who really articulated this

57:49.760 --> 57:55.200
 well. And ultimately, what ends up happening is you realize time is more valuable than the money.

57:55.200 --> 57:59.200
 But you acquire the money to gain more time.

57:59.200 --> 58:06.080
 And the reason it's valuable is because of the scarcity of time. We currently have the biology,

58:06.080 --> 58:12.960
 the physics, means that this is not just the narrative we tell ourselves. Maybe it is, I don't

58:12.960 --> 58:21.200
 know, but it feels like pretty sure we're mortal. And in that sense, the scarcity there gives value

58:21.200 --> 58:26.880
 to time. It's fascinating to think about all the thought experiments here of if that could actually

58:26.880 --> 58:32.320
 be on the economy, if you can actually convert time in a frictionless way to money.

58:32.960 --> 58:37.440
 Well, and if you start to pull on this a little bit and say, okay, a young person today, let's say

58:37.440 --> 58:42.880
 somebody in their 20s has about 2 billion seconds left in their life, right? Kind of 60 years,

58:42.880 --> 58:50.480
 give or take, based on life expectancy. They usually, until they start to understand this concept,

58:50.480 --> 58:58.400
 think of wealth in dollar terms. But dollars are being devalued. And so, you know, a million

58:58.400 --> 59:02.800
 dollars doesn't get you what it used to get, right? It's kind of an old adage. And so what

59:02.800 --> 59:09.360
 you're doing is you're pursuing something that ends up losing value. And so it's the constant rat

59:09.360 --> 59:12.880
 race. It's how do I constantly try to get more? How do I get more dollars? How do I get more

59:12.880 --> 59:17.520
 dollars? Because even if I say to myself, you know, I'm going to retire when I get $100,000.

59:17.520 --> 59:23.920
 When I get the $100,000, the $100,000 five years from now doesn't buy me what I thought it did.

59:23.920 --> 59:29.440
 So now I need $500,000 or $200,000 or a million or whatever the number is. And so ultimately what

59:29.440 --> 59:35.600
 ends up occurring is that the Bitcoin community and many people in kind of this idea of sound money

59:35.600 --> 59:41.360
 is you want to be able to acquire an asset that not only will hold the value, right,

59:41.360 --> 59:47.600
 the store value over time, but it will actually appreciate over time. And so when you look at

59:47.600 --> 59:52.080
 something like Bitcoin against the dollar against other types of assets, all of these assets are

59:52.080 --> 59:57.280
 down compared to Bitcoin, right? Now, some of that's just in the early days of kind of the

59:57.280 --> 1:00:01.680
 pricing of an asset, you go from very small to something much larger. But now what you start

1:00:01.680 --> 1:00:07.440
 to look at is, well, if you have a finite supply of something, what ends up happening is people

1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:14.080
 begin to value it more. And so in a world where dollars are infinite and other fiat currencies

1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:20.880
 are infinite, Bitcoin becomes very, very interesting, very special, and something that is very aspirational.

1:00:21.520 --> 1:00:24.800
 And so I think that's where you're starting to see people say, wait a second, this is something

1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:32.400
 where that finite, secure store of value is essential to wealth generation and preservation

1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:37.680
 over a long period of time. And if Sam Harris is right, that free will is an illusion, this is

1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:44.720
 really interesting to think about. Maybe time is the kind of blockchain, because you can't change

1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:56.160
 anything. And then the physical space time of the universe is a ledger. So maybe it won't be Bitcoin

1:00:56.160 --> 1:01:03.120
 that replaces gold. Maybe it'll be time once we crack open that in fact, the universe is fully

1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:07.360
 deterministic. So maybe that's what like Eric Weinstein is afraid of. Once you figure out the

1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:15.920
 theories of everything, of physics, we'll be able to then start trading, create a market out of like

1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:24.480
 the very fabric of reality. And that way break it. Well, if you look at infinite inflationary type

1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:29.600
 currencies, you can't do that, right? Because it constantly is losing value. When you look at a

1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:36.720
 finite asset, again, that has the provability of the actual finite element to it. Ultimately,

1:01:36.720 --> 1:01:44.560
 the wealth is that marketplace. And so, you know, I always kind of try to highlight for people.

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:52.320
 The top 55% of Americans understand something that the bottom 45% don't. They invest, right?

1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:58.880
 The bottom 45% consume the top 55% invest. And that's why we have a wealth inequality gap. And

1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:03.920
 it continues to get wider and wider and wider is because the people who are holding the devaluing

1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:10.000
 assets and saving are watching their wealth be devalued away. And there's arguments and controversy

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:15.440
 over how fast that's happening, but it's happening. The people who are holding the assets that have

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:20.800
 any level of scarcity, right? Real estate may not be finite, but it's scarce, right? Art may not be

1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:26.880
 finite, but it's scarce. Gold may not be finite, but it's scarce. Those assets continue to

1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:33.200
 appreciate against the devaluing currency. And so, when you then say, no, I have complete

1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:39.440
 finite supply with provability and this transparency around it, where everyone knows

1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:45.280
 how much is there and where it's going. Now, all of a sudden, you and I can transact back and forth

1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:49.840
 that value. And it is a representation of time. Because what I can essentially do is,

1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:57.360
 if I gather or acquire more of that wealth, I then can apply leverage to my life. I can

1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:05.280
 use machines, humans, or some other resources and basically now free up my time.

1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:09.440
 Yeah. And it's not fun to not the way you are trading time. Maybe it's a little bit indirect,

1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:16.160
 but maybe not. So just because I brought up Eric and you're on Twitter, I'd love to hear your

1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:21.600
 opinions. I talk to him a lot. He seems to have stepped into the beautiful dance

1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:27.280
 of human communication and the social dynamics that is the Bitcoin cryptocurrency community.

1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:36.960
 Do you have thoughts on gauge theoretic conceptualization of the world or just Eric in general?

1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:41.920
 He's got a lot of love in his heart and he's got grace in the way he communicates,

1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:48.960
 but he also loves to play with ideas and seems to have touched a sensitive point

1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:54.160
 with the Bitcoin community. Is there anything you could say that's hopeful and inspiring about

1:03:54.160 --> 1:04:00.080
 that whole dynamic that went down? So I don't know all of the details, but what I will say is,

1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:05.520
 I've listened to a number of his podcasts and him and there's a whole bunch of people like him.

1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:11.200
 I basically put them in the bucket of they're an independent thinker who are courageous enough

1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:20.240
 to speak their truth, whatever that may be. They are humble enough to revisit their ideas and say,

1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:24.320
 I got this right. I got this wrong. Information changed. I'll change my mind. It's obviously a

1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:28.480
 sign of intelligence to be able to do that type of stuff. And I actually think that one of the

1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:32.160
 most scarce things in our society are those independent thinkers who are able to do all this,

1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:39.280
 right? Speaking of scarcity, yeah. And so to me, I put Eric and the whole host of other people kind

1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:43.440
 of, if you look at like the intellectual dark web is kind of a label that's been used.

1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:48.880
 They're actually some of the most important people in our society because they're the people who are

1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:54.640
 willing to stand up against the mass kind of thought process. They're willing to talk about

1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:59.680
 things that others may think are taboo, right? They're willing to change their mind, which all

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:05.120
 of a sudden has become a bad thing rather than a good thing. And so when I see the exploration of

1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:11.840
 ideas in public, I actually think that those are the people who are most open to the kind of

1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:16.080
 vehement blowback as well, right? Because that's part of what they're doing is that they're

1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:20.160
 eliciting, hey, I'm going to throw an idea into the arena. If it doesn't get attacked,

1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:24.800
 they actually may be more nervous than if there is some level of kind of war of attrition, if you

1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:29.280
 will. And so what I've seen with a number of the people who have done this, everyone from some of

1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:32.960
 the best hedge fund managers and kind of money managers in the world, all the way to what I'll

1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:38.960
 consider some of the most intellectual people in the world is they play with these ideas and they

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:42.400
 play with the ideas and they play with them and they play with them and they all arrive at the same

1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:47.120
 conclusion. And sometimes it takes a month, sometimes it takes years, but they arrive at this

1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:53.280
 Bitcoin thesis. And what's so interesting about it is it highlights something that many people

1:05:53.280 --> 1:05:58.640
 view as a bug, but I think people in the Bitcoin community view as a feature, which is that community.

1:05:58.640 --> 1:06:04.320
 And so what ends up happening is when you have something that is as ambitious as

1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:09.600
 creating a global reserve currency, it doesn't mean it needs to unseat any of the existing ones,

1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:13.040
 but become the global reserve currency of the internet, this digital economy,

1:06:13.760 --> 1:06:19.040
 you need shepherds of it. And so just like a technology company wants to find those loyal fans

1:06:19.040 --> 1:06:24.320
 that are willing to go out and market in the word of mouth and kind of not only promote it,

1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:31.360
 but also protect it, this technology that is this decentralized thing, which uses a financial

1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:36.960
 incentive in order to elicit the buy in not from a financial perspective, but from a mental

1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:44.560
 energy standpoint, has built one of the most rabid, powerful and engaged communities on the

1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:50.880
 internet. And what ends up happening is those people have thought more about these ideas

1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:56.240
 and actually challenged those ideas more than anyone else in the world. And so I've got a lot

1:06:56.240 --> 1:07:00.080
 of folks who will just say, there's this guy, Marty Bent, who we'll talk all the time about,

1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:05.600
 the Bitcoin critics haven't done their homework in a lot of cases. So they show up and sometimes

1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:09.360
 it's super intellectual, lazy arguments. Sometimes it's actually very well thought out

1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:14.560
 arguments on the counter to the Bitcoin thesis. But ultimately, what ends up happening is

1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:18.480
 you're talking to somebody who's an expert. They've been thinking about for five, seven, eight,

1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:22.240
 10 years, right? They've gone through every simulation you possibly can, and they show up

1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:28.640
 with data, examples, and responses. Now, they're not always right, but they've just done the work.

1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:33.360
 And so what I actually like about folks like Eric and others is as they're kind of going through

1:07:33.360 --> 1:07:39.840
 this journey, they're incredibly smart, right? And they provide or they apply a lot of intellectual

1:07:39.840 --> 1:07:44.240
 rigor to some of these arguments. And so what it does is what does it do? It's a marketplace.

1:07:44.240 --> 1:07:49.840
 It keeps people honest. Let me sort of make a few comments. It's kind of interesting.

1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:55.600
 So you're exactly right. Maybe the blowback is part of the mechanism that actually develops

1:07:55.600 --> 1:08:00.960
 these ideas and so on. I do want to kind of speak to a little bit of the toxicity that I've

1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:05.120
 experienced in the Bitcoin community. I kind of see it, the Bitcoin community, I think you

1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:10.800
 paint a really nice picture, which I kind of see it as an immune system that protects against sort

1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:19.360
 of the viruses that are bad ideas. That said, the immune system can destroy a body, right?

1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:27.360
 And the thing you mentioned about Eric and maybe about myself and in general, just people exploring

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:33.920
 ideas is there is a Dunning Kruger effect, which is when you first start exploring ideas deeply,

1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:41.520
 you have an overblown level of confidence about how much you understand. And that's actually the

1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:45.440
 process about learning that you realize you don't understand much. What I've noticed with the Bitcoin

1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:53.520
 community is they're not as patient with the basics of the Dunning Kruger effect. If I step in

1:08:53.520 --> 1:09:04.080
 and make declarative statements about Bitcoin, I read a long time ago, the white paper, at the

1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:11.440
 cursory level, I felt that I understand the technology. This is basic intuitions. I didn't

1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:16.160
 think about the social dynamics. I didn't think about any financial implications and a lot of the

1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:20.640
 deep, actually the ongoing innovations and all that kind of stuff. But I thought I understood

1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:24.240
 that technology. And so I step in and make declarative statements. I think those are the

1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:28.960
 first time you say, okay, what's the role of Bitcoin in the world? You start thinking about it

1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:35.840
 deeply. And then you make statements. The toxicity that you get in those first few statements is

1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:41.200
 really outputting to me. I'm somebody that tries to communicate love and live that with everything

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:48.960
 I do. And there is a level of disrespect that I've experienced, not directly just observing others.

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:55.520
 People have been most kind to me. And I appreciate that. But if you're going to criticize me about

1:09:55.520 --> 1:10:01.600
 my exploration of ideas in Bitcoin, you have to also acknowledge that I'm a human being. They got

1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:07.440
 like a PhD and stuff. Like I did some hard shit that it could be in farming or it could be in

1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:12.560
 whatever. Like I've lived life and I've really thought deeply and I really care. I know a lot

1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:20.080
 of shit. And it's possible that I actually have a lot of ideas that you can learn from. Now,

1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:25.440
 if it's agriculture fine, or if it's artificial intelligence fine, like I know what I'm talking

1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:29.840
 about about certain things. And I could be wrong about a lot of things. And there's like an exchange

1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:37.200
 of ideas that makes that mechanism that you talked about more efficient. Sometimes when the

1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:43.200
 blowback is too strong too early on, the development of ideas is just inefficient. And I'm not sure

1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:52.160
 if there's a, you know, the way it was explained to me is that for so long, that community was like

1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:58.960
 bombarded with just like bad ideas, like criticisms, they're just overly sensitive now

1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:06.640
 to like to bullshit. They're like triggered by statements like they've heard it all before.

1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:11.680
 And they're like, oh, there they go again with the same old arguments. But that doesn't mean

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:17.120
 that, you know, you have to sort of, I guess, develop patience and so on, especially when you

1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:21.200
 feel like in my case that the person is coming from a good place, right? I don't know if there's

1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:26.720
 something you could say that's positive about the future of this kind of overcome as toxicity.

1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:31.120
 I think there's a couple of trends that are all kind of coalescing here, right, in these types

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:35.760
 of experiences. So one is when you look at a community, there's always a spectrum, right,

1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:40.800
 in terms of there's some people who overindex on kindness and stupidity, right? And there's some

1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:45.440
 people who overindex on intelligence and basically just being an asshole, right? And then you get

1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:51.760
 everyone in between. And so like, naturally, as we know, the extremist ends of any community

1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:59.360
 end up being the loudest usually, right? The second thing is there is from the outsider view,

1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:06.080
 like at the beginning of the exploration of ideas, it's very much a learning process, right? I don't

1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:12.160
 know if I understand this or not, but here's ideas A, B, and C. From the internal perspective,

1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:16.880
 there's a trillion dollars of value at stake and we must protect it with our lives, right?

1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:21.920
 The truth is probably somewhere in between there, right? And again, the world's not black and white,

1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:26.560
 there's this kind of more gray area that I think actually is where most people exist.

1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:32.960
 The other thing that's at play here is I think the Bitcoin community understands the internet

1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:38.480
 and internet culture and narratives better than almost anyone. And so you see this with kind of

1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:46.640
 the just complete destruction of narratives with memes and just the visceral reaction and the use

1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:53.440
 of things like Reddit and Twitter and YouTube, podcasts, just areas where I think a lot about

1:12:53.440 --> 1:13:01.680
 if you are an upstart, right? And you are going to go challenge the most well respected, elite,

1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:09.040
 kind of establishment institutions in the world. If you walk in in a suit and tie and you say,

1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:14.640
 I'm here to debate you with ideas, you're going to get your clock cleaned, right? Because they're

1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:19.200
 going to try to out their lawyers, their regulators, their lobbyists, right? Like all this stuff.

1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:24.960
 If you instead say, I'm going to meme you to death on the internet and I'm going to control the public

1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:29.840
 narrative, you've shifted the power, the asymmetry of power is more symmetrical now.

1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:36.160
 It's the ultimate insurgency, right? If you bring it back to the battlefield. Yes. And so when you

1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:41.520
 think about this, you have to lean into the advantage that you have. And so what ends

1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:48.400
 up happening is you and I would absolutely lose it if we saw JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs

1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:54.000
 with the Federal Reserve start tweeting memes, right? It would almost be the validation that

1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:01.360
 would give to the medium and the even playing field that it would provide would pull these

1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:07.840
 establishments down to the level of what is this upstart. But now what you're starting to see is

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:14.240
 that the Bitcoin community, even though there's some level of toxicity at times, even though

1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:21.840
 there's this visual reaction, sometimes there's even what I would call bullying or kind of outward

1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:25.360
 projection of things, right? Even though it may be a small percentage, it'll happen every once in a

1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:30.960
 while. What they do understand though is that these establishments are made up of humans.

1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:35.200
 And what you can actually do, one of the best ways to pick apart an institution

1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:42.160
 is to recruit from inside of them one by one. And so what you're starting to see now is,

1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:47.680
 and I get the messages on Twitter and LinkedIn all the time, hey, I'm a banker by trade, but

1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:52.880
 I'm a Bitcoiner at heart, right? And so what you're doing is you're essentially infiltrating

1:14:52.880 --> 1:15:01.920
 the organizations, not in physical population, but with the ideas and with the philosophies.

1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:10.880
 Banker in the streets, Bitcoiner in the sheets. I like it. That said, in terms of shitposting

1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:21.040
 and memes, I gotta say, bring it on because I believe in terms of asymmetry of power,

1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:29.760
 I believe that love will save the world, not memes, or at least good vibe memes as opposed to

1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:34.400
 shitposting. It's an interesting battleground though. It's an interesting battleground to think

1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:40.640
 about. The other thing I would say too is one of the elements that's always kind of funny to me

1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:46.480
 is how much of the entertainment is love, right? So when you start to think about how many of the

1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:52.880
 memes that are posted, for example, are for outsiders versus insiders, laser eyes, which

1:15:52.880 --> 1:16:00.000
 seems absolutely ridiculous, elementary and frankly beneath anyone in any level of power

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:06.160
 or influence in the world somehow has congressmen and senators who have done it. They're not trying

1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:12.400
 to convince their colleagues in elected positions to become Bitcoiners. They're speaking directly

1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:17.680
 internally to the Bitcoin community. There's some sense in which, yes, memes is love,

1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:22.080
 even if you're hearing Bitcoin is love, they're trying to convert me.

1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:28.640
 You have to laugh at, right? Probably my favorite one out of all of it is I've seen on multiple

1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:35.840
 occasions, Mark Cuban a couple of years ago, Kevin O. Leary, wealthy people, billionaires,

1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:40.560
 etc. And you have people on anonymous accounts who knows who they are telling them have fun

1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:47.840
 staying poor, right? It's just, again, part of a community and I think it's a feature,

1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:52.960
 not a bug. There's bad aspects to it at times, but I do think it's a net positive.

1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:59.840
 It's just like the immune system. It does a lot of crappy stuff, but overall, it's a major net

1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:04.880
 positive. Maybe this is a bit of a personal question for me. Just out of my own curiosity,

1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:10.720
 but I've talked to Ray Dalio a few times. So Ray Dalio, I think, was one of those people

1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:17.360
 that took the journey, the Bitcoin journey. Do you have thoughts about him specifically,

1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:22.640
 about that whole world and about the journey? Maybe of others, they're going through the same

1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:27.920
 process because Ray is, at least from my perspective, I'm a bit of an outsider. He's

1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:37.200
 one of the most insightful and deep thinkers about investment, about finance, about economics in

1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:43.840
 general, actually about life. So it's interesting to see him go on that journey. Do you have something

1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:48.720
 to comment about Ray or just those kinds of people in general? So if we look at what I'll just

1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:53.440
 consider the legends of Wall Street in general, right? There's no denying that they're incredibly

1:17:53.440 --> 1:17:57.520
 intelligent. There's no denying that actually, especially in the hedge fund world, there's

1:17:57.520 --> 1:18:02.000
 some of the most open minded people in terms of their willing to change their mind when they get

1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:07.920
 new information. There's no doubt that they are historians in the sense of having studied financial

1:18:07.920 --> 1:18:13.120
 markets and cycles over time. And also, one of the things that I really respect about all those

1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:18.560
 guys is almost all of them are willing to put ideas out via various writings that they do

1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:22.720
 and accept the public criticism, right? Whether it's Howard Marks, Ray or others,

1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:29.200
 they will put this stuff out in public. And sure, there's a lot of people who are supportive and

1:18:29.200 --> 1:18:33.120
 kind of are part of a fan base, if you will. But there's a lot of people who also think that

1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:36.800
 sometimes they say stupid things. And so putting that out takes kind of courage, right?

1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:42.000
 I think Ray's actually the most fascinating though, out of all of these kinds of legends

1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:47.920
 of Wall Street in that he understands debt cycles. He understands currencies. He,

1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:53.360
 for a while now, has been all over and famously said, you know, cashish trash,

1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:58.480
 investable assets, right? He kind of like just knew all of it. And for a long time,

1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:01.840
 Bitcoiners have said, Ray, you understand the Bitcoin argument, you're missing the last part,

1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:07.600
 which is Bitcoin's the solution, right? And so he was gold and some other ideas. But I think that

1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:15.360
 he's a perfect example of when you are part of the establishment, people view you in a very static

1:19:15.360 --> 1:19:21.440
 way as the leader of a part of establishment. But whether it's Bill Gates, Ray Dalio, or somebody

1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:26.080
 else, each one of these people were innovators and challengers to a system. They were upstarts

1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:29.840
 at one point. And so it's kind of this idea that like, if you live long enough, you eventually

1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:35.440
 become the man, right? And so, you know, Gates is a good example, right? Warren Buffett is a good

1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:40.480
 example. Ray Dalio is a good example, et cetera. And so you have to give credit, I think, to Dalio

1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:46.720
 in the sense of he kept an open mind about all of this. And more so than many of his peers has

1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:52.640
 continued to do the work and come around to this idea. And now I don't want to know if I wanted

1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:58.400
 to say that he's a Bitcoin proponent, as much as he believes it is one of, you know, a portion of

1:19:58.400 --> 1:20:03.920
 assets that can be a solution. And so to me, when you start to convince those types of people,

1:20:03.920 --> 1:20:08.720
 when it's, you know, Paul Tudor Jones, a Stanley Druckenmiller, Ray Dalio, Howard Marks,

1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:13.520
 now even writing about it saying, hey, you know, I was anti Bitcoin and put a ton of intellectual

1:20:13.520 --> 1:20:18.800
 rigor into it. But thank God, my son bought a bunch of our family, right? And kind of we've

1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:23.840
 had exposure to it. I think what it does is more than anything, it's not going to convince somebody

1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:31.280
 to go and, you know, take it seriously or go ahead and make an allocation. It reduces career risk.

1:20:31.920 --> 1:20:35.760
 And so if all of a sudden when Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller come out and say, hey,

1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:42.000
 I own Bitcoin and here's why, every other investor on Wall Street now can say to an investment committee,

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:45.680
 well, it's good enough for Paul Tudor Jones. It's good enough for Stanley Druckenmiller.

1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:52.000
 And so I think that it's very interesting because Ray doesn't just represent Wall Street. I think

1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:58.320
 Ray in some weird way represents this like macro economic investor. And so some of those are in

1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:03.200
 hedge funds and some of those people would be like CIOs at organizations. Some of them would be at

1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:08.960
 corporations and some of them are just kind of retail investors. And so you can see this kind of

1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:13.680
 inflection point throughout the adoption of Bitcoin, right? There was infrastructure that

1:21:13.680 --> 1:21:19.200
 got built, okay, that kind of led to more adoption. There was certain individuals, right? Usually they

1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:24.560
 were kind of technology oriented, entrepreneurial billionaires, they would buy it and come out

1:21:24.560 --> 1:21:30.000
 and say it, okay, that led to inflection points. You started to have some of these kind of Wall

1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:35.440
 Street legends come out, sort of financial institutions started to now you're seeing

1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:39.760
 corporations start to do it, right? Eventually, there's going to be a central bank that does it.

1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:43.760
 And so you kind of walk through that line and what you understand is like, it's the same thing

1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:49.360
 every time. It's just somebody new, right? That path, right? That Bitcoin journey, if you will.

1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:57.360
 And I think that that is almost the beauty of it is if you short circuit the journey,

1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:01.920
 it's almost like somebody doesn't appreciate it, right? If you take, let's say somebody who's a

1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:04.720
 young kid and you just give them a bunch of money and they didn't have to work hard for it,

1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:11.360
 they don't really appreciate it. And Ray actually has a book principles, right? And he talks about

1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:18.240
 the hero's journey. So he's like living it in some sense in terms of thinking about digital

1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:26.640
 currency in general, like digital finance. It's one of the big transitions, transformations of

1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:32.480
 our world in some sense. It's not just about money. Or you could argue that money is everything. I

1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:38.080
 mean, it's like money isn't just the narrow definition of money. Money is really everything.

1:22:38.080 --> 1:22:44.880
 And so where you could argue that sort of cryptocurrency is like the base layer of this

1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:49.760
 transformation to the digital space and everything else would just be built on top of it.

1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:56.080
 I use a different word that I think is kind of closer to your world, which is it's ultimately

1:22:56.080 --> 1:23:03.360
 automation. And what I mean by that is, you know, before 1970 or 1980, all the assets were analog.

1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:07.040
 And so when you have analog assets, physical stock certificates, physical bonds, right,

1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:13.920
 physical deed to a home, you have to physically exchange them. Yeah. When we wanted to increase

1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:20.800
 transactions and increase kind of global finance and access, we took those physical assets and we

1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:26.560
 created electronic QCIP assets. So now we have in centralized databases, kind of a file represents

1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:30.560
 the asset that's sitting somewhere in custody. And you and I can transact them a little bit

1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:35.120
 easier, but still centralized, there's still some bureaucracy and, you know, maybe it takes two days

1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:42.160
 to transact rather than actually mailing it across the world. Now what we're seeing is a transition

1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:47.360
 from those electronic QCIPs to these digital assets. And so if you look at, again, just let's say

1:23:47.360 --> 1:23:52.080
 money or currency, every currency in the world is going to be digital. You're going to have a digital

1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:59.200
 dollar, a digital euro, yen, RMB, you're going to have decentralized kind of open source money

1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:03.920
 like Bitcoin. You're also going to have private currencies like Facebook's attempt at DM,

1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:09.280
 and there will be others that will try to do this. And so when you get everything digital,

1:24:09.280 --> 1:24:12.000
 right, and I think that's the kind of the first step that everyone focuses on,

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:16.080
 the competition at the technology layer essentially goes away. You get some level of

1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:19.360
 feature parity. And sure, there's bells and whistles on each kind of implementation of a

1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:23.920
 digital currency. But at the end of the day, the technology is relatively the same. And ultimately

1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:28.880
 what it will do is it will facilitate the adoption of digital wallets. So you have to have a digital

1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:32.160
 wallet regardless of what digital currency you have. Same with me, same with everybody else in

1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:38.320
 the world. But what it does do is when you kind of push away and reduce the friction of competition

1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:44.560
 at the technology layer, it moves the competition to the monetary policy layer. And so when you get

1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:47.760
 to that layer, now all of a sudden it becomes interesting because all of the currencies are

1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:52.960
 the same except for this one right now. And maybe there will be others in the future. But for sure,

1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:56.960
 Bitcoin today, and people may try to replicate in a private manner or something, but Bitcoin is kind

1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:04.560
 of the only finite scarce digital sum money. And so when you then have that pretty big difference

1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:09.120
 in that competition at the monetary policy layer, it's actually not going to matter where you get

1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:15.440
 paid, right? And what I mean by that is like you and I both live in a single currency environment.

1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:21.840
 I get paid in dollars. I historically have saved in dollars. All of the assets in my life are

1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:27.920
 denominated in dollars. And I owe my debts in dollars, whether it's taxes or in the private

1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:32.480
 market. And I don't have to worry about foreign currencies. I don't exchange anything. The only

1:25:32.480 --> 1:25:36.080
 time I would ever think about another currency is if I'm going to another country in their single

1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:43.040
 currency environment and in order to change or exchange my currency, I go to the bank or I go

1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:47.920
 get ripped off at the airport. Those are my two options. So it's high friction to change between

1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:55.440
 currencies. When the competition of technology is kind of innovated away, now I can get paid in

1:25:55.440 --> 1:25:59.200
 dollars, these digital dollars, and with a click of a button switch into any other currency in the

1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:05.360
 world. And so what ultimately happens is value and liquidity is going to coalesce around the

1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:09.600
 best monetary policy. And so you get in this very weird world where even if the United States says,

1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:12.880
 hey, you're going to get paid in dollars, you have to pay your taxes in dollars, you're going to

1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:16.560
 start to see people operate in a multi currency environment where they say, okay, I got paid

1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:20.960
 my digital dollar, click a button, I save in Bitcoin, it stays there, protects or grows my

1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:24.720
 purchasing power. Oh, I need to pay my taxes. Let me switch back into dollars with click of a button

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:31.040
 and pay. When you go to a multi currency world, it's not just about currency. It's now multi

1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:37.520
 asset world, because not only is the currency digitized, but that same technology is used to

1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:43.360
 digitize stocks, bonds and commodities as well. And so today we live in a very fragmented financial

1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:47.360
 world where basically I have a brokerage account, I have a bank account, I may have an alternative

1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:54.240
 asset account, etc. When I can put all those assets in a single digital wallet, and I can then go

1:26:54.240 --> 1:26:58.160
 from asset to asset without having to go back to a single unit of account.

1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:03.440
 Like frictionless going from asset to asset. So now what you end up doing is you start to

1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:09.680
 open up the possibility for machine to machine transactions. So today, if you and I write software

1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:14.880
 code for two machines to transact with each other, they can't transact physical currency.

1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:19.440
 And in many cases, they can't actually transact the electronic QCIP currencies or assets either,

1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:23.280
 because there's too long a settlement time. So you can't get true automation, right? So the whole

1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:28.640
 idea of the car is going to drive over a strip in the road and it's going to pay the toll, right?

1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:31.200
 Well, that can't happen right now because literally the transaction won't go through,

1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:36.880
 right? And so I always joke that in an automated world, it's like a CDROM,

1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:40.880
 but we're trying to cassette take player assets and put in the CDROM. It's just incompatible

1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:45.760
 technology. References, nobody understands at this point. By the way, you need to update your

1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:51.040
 references. I probably do. It's like taking a CDROM, trying to put an MP3 player into streaming.

1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:54.880
 But I think that the reason why that becomes really interesting is when you start to create

1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:59.760
 these digital assets, now you open up the world of possibilities. So when new technology is created,

1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:03.440
 you can do two things. You can either create new things the world's never seen before,

1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:08.400
 or you can use it to improve the old world. Most people, because it's the easiest thing to think

1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:13.600
 about, want to improve the old world. So an equivalent of this would be when the internet

1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:18.000
 came along, a media company that had newspapers would say, hey, we should take a PDF of the

1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:21.680
 newspaper and we should put it on a website. And now anyone in the world can go to this website

1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:27.120
 and they can read the newspaper today. That was valuable, but it missed out on the ability to

1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:32.720
 change headlines, to test, to put multimedia, to distribute it differently, to do all kinds of

1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:36.560
 things that today we understand the internet really empowered. And so what I think we're

1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:40.880
 about to watch happen is we're going to digitize the assets. We're going to put them all into these

1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:45.440
 digital wallets. You're going to get automated technologies where machines can now transact

1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:51.840
 with each other. And we're going to do simple things. Why do we pay people once every two weeks?

1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:57.040
 Why don't we just pay them at the end of every day? Or why don't I literally stream payments to

1:28:57.040 --> 1:29:03.280
 you on an hour by hour basis based on the work you do? It would solve incredible economic issues

1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:07.280
 in our country and in countries around the world. But historically, businesses can't do this

1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:11.200
 because of the technology problem. They can't keep track of it all. How do they pay everyone

1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:16.080
 every day? How do they pay everyone every hour? You just can't do it. Yeah, it's funny. The vision

1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:22.800
 of the future you're painting, it's kind of an exciting one. And it almost makes me sad looking

1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:28.320
 into the future when we'll look back at this time. It's like how incredibly inefficient

1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:35.600
 of financial transactions were like the transaction of value of any kind. Like how

1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:41.440
 like what to pay each other. Like there has to like processes. There's like payroll and all this

1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:48.880
 kind of just the entirety of transactions is just like painful. Almost all transactions are painful.

1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:56.160
 And even the companies that innovate to make the transactions a little bit more frictionless

1:29:56.160 --> 1:30:01.440
 like Amazon with the one click purchase button like went out huge. But even that's really painful.

1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:06.000
 There's actually a really interesting especially then you start to move that into the space of data.

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:12.800
 There's a lot of people thinking about privacy and data and like can we put, can we like convert

1:30:12.800 --> 1:30:19.280
 data into like money so that you can pay for how much you reveal to the companies about your own

1:30:19.280 --> 1:30:25.520
 private data that can then be used to assign value to you so you can use the service for free if

1:30:25.520 --> 1:30:30.400
 you hand over the data but there's like explicit transaction going on. So you can empower all

1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:37.040
 those kinds of things that will just like fundamentally change our world. That's really,

1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:41.920
 really exciting. One of the most interesting things to me is I invested in a company called

1:30:41.920 --> 1:30:48.160
 Bridget and what they told me was they said $8 billion was paid to the top four banks last year

1:30:48.880 --> 1:30:54.400
 on overdraft fees. So literally they took $8 billion from people who didn't have money in their bank

1:30:54.400 --> 1:30:59.120
 account. Right. And so when you dig into why is that a lot of times it's not that the people

1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:04.480
 don't have the money. It's actually a mismatch of the payments. So what ends up happening is you

1:31:04.480 --> 1:31:09.520
 get paid on the first and the 15th but on the 12th your Netflix bill hits on the 13th you went

1:31:09.520 --> 1:31:14.240
 grocery shopping and on the 14th your car payments hit you overdraft and then on the 15th you actually

1:31:14.240 --> 1:31:18.240
 get the check and then you're able to pay not only the overdraft but for the expenses that you have.

1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:23.840
 And so something as simple as just getting paid at the end of every day immediately would eliminate

1:31:23.840 --> 1:31:29.440
 you know some big percentage of those $8 billion of value that flows to large institutions on

1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:34.800
 overdraft fees. Yeah. And also I mean this whole process with overdraft fees and just

1:31:34.800 --> 1:31:40.720
 many of the financial transactions we have to live through today forces many of us to be like

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:48.160
 accountants like to understand the different mechanism of financial like the movement of money

1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:54.080
 as opposed to you which is what we want to do as human beings operating in a high layers of like

1:31:54.080 --> 1:32:00.560
 providing services for others of like following your passions and like working for others like

1:32:00.560 --> 1:32:07.760
 doing cool shit or you know basically providing value exchanging value in the world and not

1:32:07.760 --> 1:32:12.560
 thinking about the money. The money takes care of itself and then you see the results of it. So

1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:22.160
 you're able to think in terms of money but not have to know how the like the accounting works.

1:32:22.960 --> 1:32:28.800
 Automation simply frees humans up to do more creative work. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Like

1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:35.360
 that's it. Yeah. Which is why you use the term automation which I think is kind of brilliant

1:32:35.360 --> 1:32:41.120
 reframing of all of this. Yeah. Because ultimately digital technologies are merely the conduit to

1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:48.480
 usher us into that world. Yeah. And I think the most fascinating part of this entire industry

1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:53.920
 is people who are trying to figure out now that we're going to have these digital technologies

1:32:54.560 --> 1:32:59.840
 how do we usher in that automated world faster. And so there's people who are building all kinds

1:32:59.840 --> 1:33:07.680
 of incredible things. Right. There's literally some technologies where you can stream for paying

1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:13.280
 for consumption of content. Yeah. Right. There's I saw somebody recently who they basically said

1:33:13.280 --> 1:33:19.680
 hey I have created something but it's not going to be released until everyone almost like a go

1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:25.120
 fund me type situation pays for in combination then it gets unlocked. And so when you start

1:33:25.120 --> 1:33:29.680
 to think about this it's not only innovation on the technology front it's innovation around

1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:36.160
 the way that we form capital. It's the way that we organize resources. It's the way that we build

1:33:36.160 --> 1:33:40.480
 companies. It's the business models. Right. It's the application of those technologies.

1:33:40.480 --> 1:33:47.360
 All that stuff starts to change and go back to 20 2007 when the iPhone came out.

1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:51.920
 Uber wasn't possible. Right. We just go down the line like all these companies that weren't

1:33:51.920 --> 1:33:57.280
 possible before when the digital technologies are kind of adopted on a global scale. I think

1:33:57.280 --> 1:34:03.280
 that we all myself included drastically underestimate how fast and how big innovation

1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:07.760
 can be because it's just hard. Right. Like we like to think linearly and that's not how the

1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:15.440
 world works. Yeah. I do find it kind of interesting. It is NFT based but I don't think it has to be

1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:23.840
 this idea of I think big cloud it's called or whatever the idea of sort of investing in

1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:31.120
 individuals. It makes me immediately think about investing in ideas. So even just the words you

1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:40.160
 speak having value and sort of if you have a frictionless like automated financial system

1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:45.680
 then you could do a bunch of interesting things about what it means to add value to the world.

1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:54.320
 I mean I don't know if big cloud is currently an efficient representation of that but I am truly

1:34:54.320 --> 1:35:03.600
 happy that however that thing works I'm just one notch above Vladimir Putin which is one of the

1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:09.280
 that's like one of the bucket list items for me to have a list where I'm one notch above Putin.

1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:14.400
 But I think you're talking about here is important because there's historical examples.

1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:20.400
 You could invest in a patent in some situations. You could invest in an organization that has an

1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:25.280
 idea. So these are super inefficient given kind of the vision that you're painting in terms of

1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:30.080
 like investing directly in an idea in a super efficient automated fashion. But that's how the

1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:35.840
 technology evolution works. It's really hard to do it first and then slowly kind of becomes easier

1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:40.320
 and easier as technology is more prevalent. The other thing that I think is interesting is this

1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:45.440
 whole idea of investing in people. If you really think about the origination of that is I would

1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:50.800
 hire somebody right. I pay you money and then you're going to create production but I take the

1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:57.120
 lion's share and you don't. Now there's things like these ISAs these income sharing agreements

1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:03.120
 where basically I will educate you on something train you on something. I'll put up capital right

1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:09.360
 and then over time you'll pay me back plus profits as some version. Eventually I don't know what it

1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:17.040
 looks like but being able to get upside in somebody's success for having risk capital early on

1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:21.600
 doesn't seem that far off. You see it in professional sports. You see it in a lot of these things.

1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:29.040
 And so I just think that a lot of the focus right now is on the technology. But ultimately these

1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:35.040
 are ideas that are very old and have had lots of success and traction and we're just merely

1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:40.880
 standing in the way of the evolution of these ideas with new technology. And so it's easy to

1:36:40.880 --> 1:36:45.280
 get caught up in the technology but when you really zoom out and look at it from the ideological

1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:49.840
 standpoint and kind of the progress of humanity it's a foregone conclusion. This stuff's going

1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:55.600
 to happen. It's just how. I think the world is waiting and some of us are trying to create

1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:00.080
 that future world which is like what are the applications of this technology that will transform

1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:08.640
 the world. And then hate the term but killer apps. Cool ideas that are implemented effectively at

1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:15.520
 scale that transform the world. There's been a lot of different ideas popping up. There's

1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:19.600
 a lot of ideas about social networks that are built on top of the technology and all that kind

1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:26.640
 of stuff. But let me actually drag this back down to something basic. If a person wanted to

1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:36.080
 buy Bitcoin, store Bitcoin, how do they actually do it? Yeah. So there's a couple of different

1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:42.400
 ways to kind of acquire Bitcoin. And in every way you've got to exchange some form of value

1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:49.120
 for Bitcoin which is part of why it has value because you're giving up value. So in one way

1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:56.640
 is to exchange energy and computational power for Bitcoin. So you can mine it. You can literally

1:37:56.640 --> 1:38:03.040
 take computer power that you have. You can rent it to the network and run that software and then

1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:09.360
 it will pay you a portion of the kind of daily revenue off that system. You can acquire Bitcoin

1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:14.880
 in exchange for your power and your computational kind of contribution. And that's the fundamental

1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:21.280
 principle behind Bitcoin is the proof of work. So I got a hundred bucks. Like I use Cash App.

1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:32.720
 There's Coinbase. There's all these exchanges. Like how do I convert my $100 to Bitcoin? Is

1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:38.960
 there something disclaimer? This is not financial advice. And this is just us talking in just your

1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:48.800
 opinions. Do not use this to invest or take as financial expertise. That said, is there something

1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:53.840
 you recommend that's an easy entry point for somebody that's like, hmm, I wonder if I can

1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:59.680
 convert this $100 into whatever amount of Bitcoin? What do you recommend? What are the options?

1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:04.000
 So there's a lot of options. I'm heavily biased. I went out and I scoured the market,

1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:07.600
 looked at all of them. I've invested a lot of money in a company called BlockFi that basically

1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:12.880
 basically has financial products for crypto investors. So you can go, you can take dollars or

1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:18.240
 other currency you have. You can convert it through an exchange. You can leave it on these

1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:21.680
 interest bearing accounts. You can earn interest just like you would earn in a traditional account,

1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:26.800
 but higher levels of interest because it's this new thing. Or you can withdraw it and you can put

1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:30.800
 it into cold storage on a hardware device. You can leave it in a software wallet. There's kind

1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:35.280
 of all these storage options. So BlockFi is kind of the one that I'm biased towards because I...

1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:42.720
 So BlockFi is Bitcoin only or is it in exchange with other crypto?

1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:46.560
 It's got a bunch of different ones. Yeah. They basically are agnostic to what it is,

1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:51.520
 but they provide kind of financial products to crypto investors.

1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:56.320
 Okay. So you mentioned a few interesting ideas that'd be nice for people who would not be familiar

1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:04.640
 with it. Cold storage, hot storage. What does that mean? So I go to a website and I convert dollars

1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:12.400
 to Bitcoin. That's a kind of storage. That's like online banking. What else is there?

1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:16.800
 So there's a couple of different things that you can do, right? And let's use the legacy system as

1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:24.960
 kind of an example. So if I want to get currency and I put in my bank account, it sits there.

1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:30.080
 I have to trust that the bank doesn't go under. Nobody steals it, all this kind of stuff. There's

1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:34.560
 insurance for it, right? There's all these kind of benefits in the legacy system to make sure that

1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:38.000
 as long as I don't have millions and millions of dollars there, I'm going to be protected pretty

1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:44.960
 much if anything happens through FDIC insurance. If I want to do that, I'm taking that counterparty

1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:49.040
 risk though. So it's mitigated, but there's still counterparty risk. I'm counting on that bank.

1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:51.840
 But it is easier to move it around, right? If all of a sudden you call me up and say,

1:40:51.840 --> 1:40:55.520
 hey, send me some money, I can press a couple of buttons on my computer and it'll send it to you.

1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:02.400
 If I want deeper level of security, I can go and I can get the physical dollars and I can go and I

1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:07.360
 can put it under my mattress, right? And I can say, you know what? It's not going to be as easy to

1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:11.680
 send it to you immediately, but if I really want to, I can go underneath my mattress pretty quickly,

1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:16.400
 I can grab it, I can get it back to the bank, and then I can send you the money. The third thing I

1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:20.080
 could do is I could basically take those physical dollars out of the bank and I could go and I could

1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:26.160
 go put it literally in a vault somewhere that I don't have control over that's behind 10 passwords

1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:30.800
 and biometric scanning and it's really difficult to even get to it, right? So if you can almost

1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:34.640
 look at it, it's like there's three stages of security that you could have in the traditional

1:41:34.640 --> 1:41:38.640
 world. The same thing is true in Bitcoin. So you could buy Bitcoin on any exchange. You could do

1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:44.960
 it on BlockFi, but you also can do it on places like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, etc. Also, Cash App.

1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:49.520
 Cash App. You can do it on Cash App. I think there's still sponsor in the spot, yes.

1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:57.120
 I'm not biased at all. So once you get Bitcoin on any of these venues, you can leave it there

1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:03.440
 on that venue. Now, the tradeoff is you're taking counterparty risk. So somebody else

1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:09.040
 is responsible for the security and the protection of it. In many cases, big, well known companies

1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:12.720
 who have billions and billions of dollars of assets, they have higher levels of security. That's

1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:16.080
 why they're well known. That's why people trust them, whatever. But you are taking counterparty risk.

1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:22.880
 It is easier to quickly send to somebody. So the tradeoff of ease of use, but counterparty risk

1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:28.080
 is big. And in the Bitcoin community specifically, there's a huge thing of they really, really have

1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:33.600
 a keep for not leaving the Bitcoin there for the obvious counterparty. The second thing you can do

1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:38.960
 is you can basically get it off of an exchange and you can put it in some level of what I'll call

1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.280
 a second layer of storage. That second layer storage could be a hardware device that you can

1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:47.440
 quickly just grab off your desk and plug into your computer and immediately use. That's what they

1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:52.480
 call a hardware wallet. Or you can have some sort of software wallet where it's not on an

1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:57.520
 exchange, but there is some level of in between between the hardware wallet and the exchange

1:42:57.520 --> 1:43:02.720
 and the software wallet. But the software wallet is connected to the internet. Yeah. And so if you

1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:07.200
 kind of think of it as like the exchange, software wallet, hardware wallet, and then there's something

1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:15.280
 called deep storage or cold storage. And this is literally there was a company called Zappo that

1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:19.440
 would put things in deep cold storage and it was literally buried in a mountain.

1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:24.640
 Right. So like the odds that somebody's physically going to go there, there's armed guards,

1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:28.960
 there's kind of all this type of stuff. But again, you're taking some level of counterparty risk

1:43:28.960 --> 1:43:35.440
 because they have your Bitcoin. And so the saying or the phrase is not your keys, not your coins.

1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:42.240
 Or as my buddy Isaiah Jackson came up with, he said, not your keys, not your cheese, right,

1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:47.440
 in terms of sovereignty is important, right? And ultimately, this goes back to kind of the

1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:52.800
 beginning of our conversation around Bitcoin's ethos, sovereignty, right, giving the power back

1:43:52.800 --> 1:43:57.840
 to people. You don't have to rely on this infrastructure in order to be able to participate

1:43:57.840 --> 1:44:03.600
 in this monetary kind of economy, which you are now able to do as you're able to use digital sound

1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:08.160
 money, you're able to keep control of it, you and you alone are responsible for it. So the idea of

1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:13.840
 personal responsibility. And then also you and you alone make the decisions as to whether you hold

1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:18.400
 onto it or you use it without censorship, right? No one can tell you what you can do with it or

1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:25.600
 can't do with it. And so the purchase and the storage, what I find is, depending on who you are,

1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:32.640
 there's varying degrees of kind of concern or decisions that get made there. And a lot of it

1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:37.760
 comes down to personal preference. The Bitcoin community, though, absolutely will over optimize

1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:44.480
 for sovereignty and kind of hardware or cold storage. I wonder if you can sort of comment on that,

1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:54.160
 because you have both sort of a cash app and the BlockFi and Coinbase, you can store it there,

1:44:54.160 --> 1:44:59.600
 you can purchase and trade it there and store it there and so on. But ultimately, they're saying,

1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:05.600
 you want to keep some of it there, but you want to move it to the hardware wallet. And the cold

1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:10.240
 storage of the hardware wallet is like you can disconnect it from the computer because ultimately

1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:16.160
 stuff that's connected to the internet can be compromised, can be controlled by governments

1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:22.880
 and other parties and so on. What are your thoughts about, sort of practically speaking for maybe

1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:29.120
 like a regular citizen, what should be the role of the hardware wallet in their lives?

1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:33.520
 Yeah. So at the highest level, I just think that like learning about it is important, right? So

1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:38.800
 even if you only have $5 equivalent of Bitcoin, going and understanding here's how it works,

1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:42.960
 here's why it's important, here's how I would actually withdraw from an exchange under the

1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:47.280
 hardware wallet, like that alone just as an intellectual exercise is a worthwhile pursuit.

1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:50.960
 I think people should go do that. Actually go through the process of the step so you feel like

1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:56.160
 you can do it. Yeah. It's kind of like if I said to you, hey, we're going to go buy an asset and

1:45:56.160 --> 1:46:00.720
 you never went and you looked at it, you never went and made a decision like, sure, maybe I did

1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:04.320
 it or I didn't do it, but like you didn't actually experience it, right? And so I think that that's

1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:10.400
 an important part. The second thing is each person is different from a, how they view this asset.

1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:13.600
 So there are some people who are speculating, right? There's three use cases for Bitcoin,

1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:17.680
 their store value, medium of exchange and speculation. And the people who are speculating,

1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:20.960
 they can't put it in deep cold storage because they need to be able to trade it.

1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:25.600
 So what ends up happening is they fall in the bucket of like high risk, high reward.

1:46:26.240 --> 1:46:29.920
 They're trying to trade, they're trying to do all these things and sure, maybe there are

1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:34.480
 profits that they can generate if they're good at it, but also they're introducing a lot of risk.

1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:37.600
 And so that person is very different than the person who says, hey, you know, I bought one

1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:40.960
 Bitcoin and I'm going to save it for my child, right? And I'm going to give it to him on their

1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:45.360
 18th birthday. Yeah. And so when you start to look at this, what you end up saying is,

1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:50.240
 what are you actually purchasing this for? Kind of like, why are you doing it?

1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:55.840
 And then what's your time horizon? And what ends up happening is more and more people in the Bitcoin

1:46:55.840 --> 1:47:00.720
 community have longer time horizons. One of the advantages to this community, right? If you look

1:47:00.720 --> 1:47:06.560
 at the on chain metrics, 60% of Bitcoin haven't moved from the digital wallet in which they sit

1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:11.520
 in the last 12 months. So even though it's appreciated hundreds of percent on the upside,

1:47:11.520 --> 1:47:15.920
 there's been lots of volatility, a 50% drop in a single day in terms of US dollar price,

1:47:16.560 --> 1:47:20.080
 still doesn't move. And so these are kind of the long term holders, right? These are the

1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:26.080
 iron fist or as recently as become popular, the diamond hands, right? They're just,

1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:32.240
 they're not going anywhere. And so I think that those people are much more likely to not have

1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:37.680
 their Bitcoin on exchanges or in software walls. They've got it in some sort of like highly secure

1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:44.800
 environment. And what, and one in which they have deep sovereignty or kind of prevalent sovereignty.

1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:48.880
 And the reason for that is because they have that long time horizon. They don't want to be

1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:56.000
 kind of convicted around Bitcoin, sound money, macro environment, all the stuff. And then they

1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:01.840
 make a mistake because they trusted, you know, ABCD company, and that counterparty risk ends

1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:09.280
 up actually being, you know, fatal or detrimental. So again, this is not financial advice disclaimer,

1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:16.720
 but let me ask, in terms of investment advice on Bitcoin, so you see Bitcoin is potentially

1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:21.920
 not just the thing that you speculate over, like buy and sell, buy and sell, buy and sell,

1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:27.680
 but it's something that you can just buy only. And I believe I've heard that you own quite a

1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:34.560
 large percentage of your wealth in Bitcoin and you're basically buying only and storing long

1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:39.600
 term. So that's something that's a legitimate way to approach Bitcoin in your recommendation.

1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:44.560
 Go to other cultures. So if we remove ourselves from the Western world culture of

1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:49.600
 investing and gamification of financial markets and the financialization of everything,

1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:55.920
 let's say we go to the culture of India. For hundreds, if not thousands of years, families

1:48:55.920 --> 1:49:03.360
 basically saved their wealth in gold and in jewelry and in these hard assets with the expectation

1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:10.800
 to pass it on to the next generation. And so it would be blasphemous to sell the family's gold

1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:15.200
 in that culture. Your great grandfather gave it to your grandfather, your grandfather gave it to

1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:23.600
 your father, your father gave it to you. And so in that culture, the long term kind of holding

1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:30.640
 is the default. I think that what Bitcoin has presented again is a digital application

1:49:30.640 --> 1:49:35.280
 of the exact same thing, which is that while everything else in the world is being devalued,

1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:41.600
 that is denominated in a currency that is being inflated away, whether it's quickly or not,

1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:47.200
 this finite supply, this scarce asset ends up accruing more and more value over time.

1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:54.960
 And so I think that for me personally, I've got over 95% of my net worth that's in this.

1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:02.880
 Over 95% of your net worth. There's two important caveats to this. One is,

1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:08.560
 I didn't buy some Bitcoin in 2011 or 2012, right? And then all of a sudden it appreciated a bunch

1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:14.000
 and it grew into that. But from a cost basis perspective, I put $100 and now it's a ton of

1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:21.840
 money. Instead, what I did was I basically in 2018, saw Bitcoin from a US dollar price standpoint

1:50:21.840 --> 1:50:26.160
 was falling and falling and falling. And in December of 2018, I said, take about 50% of my

1:50:26.160 --> 1:50:31.600
 net worth and convert it from dollar denominated assets into Bitcoin. So it was very kind of

1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:35.840
 intentional decision with a very specific view on the world as to why I was doing it.

1:50:36.640 --> 1:50:42.720
 I then essentially just let it sit there, grow, whatever, until the spring of 2020.

1:50:43.520 --> 1:50:48.560
 And when I saw the government step in and start to say, hey, we're going to really be aggressive

1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:52.160
 in terms of interest rate manipulation and quantitative easing, I then decided to go

1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:56.720
 ahead and take basically the remainder and start to convert it as well. So it became very aggressive

1:50:56.720 --> 1:51:03.600
 in doing that. And so the way that I look at it is that's actually my savings, right? And so in

1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:07.680
 some weird way, if I said, you know, what's the dollar worth, you'd say, well, a $1 bill is worth

1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:14.240
 $1, right? Bitcoin to me, I denominate my wealth in Bitcoin. So I think of one Bitcoin is worth

1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:19.040
 one Bitcoin, not one Bitcoin is worth $60,000 or $55,000 or $70,000, right? I denominate everything

1:51:19.040 --> 1:51:23.440
 in Bitcoin. When I make a purchase in my head, I'm calculating how much Bitcoin am I spending

1:51:23.440 --> 1:51:29.200
 right now, right? Well, guess what happens? When you have a devaluing currency as the denominator,

1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:34.560
 doesn't matter, right? Like you're finding some incentivized to spend or invest trying to consume.

1:51:35.600 --> 1:51:41.040
 When you have an appreciating currency, all of a sudden, you become much less

1:51:41.040 --> 1:51:48.000
 consumptive in your behavior. Because you're actually trading off future purchasing power

1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:56.160
 for the consumption today. It's fascinating to think that if, when you move about this world,

1:51:56.160 --> 1:52:02.960
 you think in Bitcoin, you behave differently as if you think in dollars. That's really fascinating.

1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:09.680
 But here's the thing is, the last 50 years or so is actually the outlier in history.

1:52:09.680 --> 1:52:18.320
 Most people used to think this way. It's only when a fiat currency got introduced that one

1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:24.320
 argument, the positive argument or perspective is there was an explosion in growth. But really,

1:52:24.320 --> 1:52:29.040
 it's because there was a financial incentive to consume, right? And there's nobody better

1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:34.480
 in the world than the United States at consuming. And we consume anything and everything. And if

1:52:34.480 --> 1:52:39.600
 you want to see a great example, look at how big the Coca Colas are at McDonald's. You go to the

1:52:39.600 --> 1:52:46.000
 places they don't serve them that big. And so the other example that were the negative argument

1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:53.280
 is we have to consume. Because if not, you end up being the bottom 45% of Americans that

1:52:53.280 --> 1:52:58.480
 have no investable assets and actually are just having their wealth devalued away. So holding

1:52:58.480 --> 1:53:04.640
 the dollars end up being a very bad economic decision. And so when you then switch to this

1:53:04.640 --> 1:53:11.440
 sound money, you say, wait a second, why would I, if today I can trade one Bitcoin back in

1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:17.840
 October of last year, one Bitcoin for $10,000 US, why would I spend that if at some point in

1:53:17.840 --> 1:53:22.880
 the future, whether it's a month from now or 10 years from now, I could trade it for something

1:53:22.880 --> 1:53:31.280
 much, much more than that? You just become much more of a anti consumer and much more of a long

1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:35.520
 term thinker. Yeah, from the individual perspective, that's pretty powerful. I wonder, I mean, I think

1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:42.320
 that's an interesting debate. What's better for the long term economy? No, better for the growth

1:53:42.320 --> 1:53:50.480
 of the civilization. Because capitalism is fascinating. It seems to work pretty well.

1:53:51.280 --> 1:53:58.880
 There's this kind of like Eric Weinstein says that one of the problems is for the past several

1:53:58.880 --> 1:54:06.000
 decades, this whole economy, society is built on the idea that we have to keep growing. It depends

1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:13.120
 on that idea. And it's a good question whether that's going to result in huge problems. Or if

1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:21.120
 like a college student on a deadline, the dependence on growth will mean that we'll have to grow.

1:54:21.760 --> 1:54:27.600
 Like the fear of death will force us to grow. But I think there's a false equivalency between

1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:32.640
 I mean, we're dependent on growth. And then if the world was denominated and sound money,

1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:38.400
 we don't grow. What I think ends up happening is we remove a lot of the society's bullshit.

1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:44.880
 Because right now, when the money is free or the currency is free, you can come up with all

1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:50.400
 kinds of crazy stuff and people will give it to you. When all of a sudden, it's really, really

1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:56.880
 valued by the population. The decisions are better. Yeah, you have to provide real value

1:54:56.880 --> 1:54:59.600
 in the goods and services you provide in order to get them to give it to you.

1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:05.680
 There's less room for corruption, less room for manipulation that's not actually productive. Yeah,

1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:16.000
 definitely. So you said you moved a lot of your investment into Bitcoin. When you look,

1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:21.520
 so you're a special human being in many ways. So you're like a strategic thinker,

1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:25.440
 but you're also like a deep thinker about this whole thing. But when you look at a regular

1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:32.480
 plug like me, in terms of just investing and moving into thinking about cryptocurrency,

1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:37.360
 is there a strategy that you recommend? What are the different options about investing

1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:42.720
 into Bitcoin? Yeah, so I think that there's just kind of timeless advice when it comes to

1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:48.480
 investing or acquiring an asset in general. Dollar cost averaging is usually the best

1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:53.920
 way to think about it. And what I mean by that is most people don't just have a pile of

1:55:53.920 --> 1:55:57.280
 currency sitting in it, right? It's not like they have a million dollars sitting in their bank.

1:55:57.280 --> 1:56:04.080
 They're like, what do I do with it? That situation aside, what happens is they trade their hours and

1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:10.000
 their effort for currency. And so as they get paid every two weeks, let's say, the best way to

1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:14.720
 acquire Bitcoin without having to worry about timing markets and being a professional trader,

1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:19.760
 is to simply take whatever the percentage is that you want and to buy Bitcoin when you get your

1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:24.640
 paycheck. So if you get paid on the 1st and 15th of every month, on that day, you should go take,

1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:28.800
 you know, let's say it's 3% of your paycheck. Take 3% go buy Bitcoin. Don't worry about what the

1:56:28.800 --> 1:56:33.680
 price is. You should do that over time. And the reason why that's important is if in December

1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:39.440
 of 2017, when Bitcoin is at $20,000, it was the height of kind of this last big upwards movement,

1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:44.880
 you had taken all of your money and you had put it into Bitcoin. You would have had to wait almost

1:56:44.880 --> 1:56:53.120
 three years just to get back to break even in US dollar terms. If at the same time, you had simply

1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:58.160
 bought then and over the next three years bought every two weeks, you would have been up hundreds

1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:02.880
 of percent three years later. Because what ended up happening was you bought a bunch of Bitcoin

1:57:02.880 --> 1:57:09.840
 when it was at $15, $12, $10, $9, $8, $3, $4, $5, $5, $5, you know, all the way back up on the other

1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:15.440
 side. And so dollar cost averaging is one of these weird things that it almost sounds too easy.

1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:20.320
 But what we find is in America, we have a lack of financial education.

1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:25.360
 And so rather than try to be smarter than markets, what most people are better off doing is just

1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:31.280
 saying, hey, set your what's called an asset allocation plan. I want 30% in stocks. I want

1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:35.680
 10% in real estate. I want this, this, whatever. And every time you get your paycheck, just think

1:57:35.680 --> 1:57:40.720
 of it as a savings account, right? Just put it in based on those percentages and don't think about

1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:46.400
 it. And over a long enough period of time, what we find is almost anyone in the United States,

1:57:46.400 --> 1:57:50.160
 right? There's exceptions, but almost anyone in the United States can become a millionaire in

1:57:50.160 --> 1:57:54.560
 their lifetime if they follow these plans and have that long term view and they allow compounding

1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:59.360
 to work for them. And so don't look at the price of Bitcoin and all that kind of stuff. Just pick

1:57:59.360 --> 1:58:06.080
 a specific time, specific day that you just buy and you just keep buying. That's probably good

1:58:06.080 --> 1:58:11.280
 investment advice across any kind of assets. If you don't believe in Bitcoin and you just want

1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:15.520
 to, let's say you just want to do the S&P 500. You shouldn't try to time the market of the S&P

1:58:15.520 --> 1:58:19.440
 500 either, right? You should just, every two weeks, you should just buy some in over a 20 year

1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:23.200
 period. You're going to end up buying it at all kinds of different prices, but you're going to get

1:58:23.200 --> 1:58:28.400
 kind of a blended average. And the more important thing is the compounding and the time in the market

1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:33.520
 then did you buy it at 2% higher or lower than where you bought it? It doesn't really matter.

1:58:33.520 --> 1:58:40.000
 And buying often makes you, I guess, resistant, robust to the volatility of the market or the

1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:48.880
 volatility of the Bitcoin price and so on. That said, Bitcoin price is volatile. And

1:58:48.880 --> 1:58:59.120
 again, the argument I've heard is like everything that's going to be a lot more valuable in the

1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:07.920
 future. If you look at the history, companies like Apple, like Tesla is now, but let's look at

1:59:07.920 --> 1:59:13.760
 companies that have now stabilized, right? Apple is a good example. It's like volatile in the

1:59:13.760 --> 1:59:19.040
 beginning. And so the argument for Bitcoin is like, yeah, this is the early stages because it's

1:59:19.040 --> 1:59:24.000
 going to be a lot more valuable. Right now it's volatile. And this is why you have to have these

1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:28.720
 kinds of strategies to ride out the volatility. Of course, everything that goes to zero is also

1:59:28.720 --> 1:59:35.840
 volatile. Like the early days are volatile. Do you see like this volatility as like a feature

1:59:35.840 --> 1:59:40.880
 or a bug or is it just like a way of life? So Amazon is the one that I know the numbers on

1:59:40.880 --> 1:59:47.600
 in terms of the early volatility. Every year since it has gone public, it's had a double digit drawdown

1:59:47.600 --> 1:59:53.440
 in that year. The average is over 30%. And one time it drew down over 95%.

1:59:55.200 --> 2:00:00.240
 Sounds a lot like Bitcoin, right? Like, oh, that's crazy. But it's one of the best performing

2:00:00.240 --> 2:00:05.520
 stocks in the last 20 years, if not the best performing stock. And so volatility is not positive

2:00:05.520 --> 2:00:11.360
 or negative. It's positive or negative compared to the position you're in. So if you're long

2:00:11.360 --> 2:00:17.120
 and it's volatile to the upside, it's positive. If you're long holding something and it's volatile

2:00:17.120 --> 2:00:21.520
 to the downside, you see it as a negative. It's all about perspective. With that said,

2:00:22.800 --> 2:00:31.120
 another way that I look at this is every asset priced in Bitcoin is down significantly. So

2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:37.440
 over the last one, three, five years, the dollar priced in Bitcoin has crashed 99%.

2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:44.880
 If you denominate stocks, it's down like 80%, 85%. If you denominate gold, if you

2:00:44.880 --> 2:00:49.520
 denominate bonds, if you just go down the line, real estate, et cetera, it's all down massively

2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:54.800
 against Bitcoin. Now, you could argue that that's because Bitcoin is appreciating in U.S. dollar

2:00:54.800 --> 2:01:01.200
 terms, or you could actually argue that the world is repricing this asset, doing price discovery

2:01:01.200 --> 2:01:05.920
 on this asset. And it's essentially comparing. It's saying, hey, Bitcoin versus the stock,

2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:10.400
 or Bitcoin versus this ounce of gold, or Bitcoin versus this dollar, which is more valuable. And

2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:14.880
 it continues to move up in the rankings in terms of the value that the world ascribes to this.

2:01:14.880 --> 2:01:18.800
 Some of that is based on Lindy effect, just the longer it persists, the more likely it is to survive.

2:01:19.360 --> 2:01:23.120
 Some of that is based on the underlying fundamentals of how much computing power,

2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:28.960
 the usage, transaction volume, things like that. But some of it also is that as more and more people

2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:33.600
 wake up to the fact that it's a finite supply asset that has a place in the world and demand

2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:39.360
 increases, people just naturally compete and ascribe more value to it. And so the volatility,

2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:44.880
 I think, all comes back to like, what do you price your life in? For a majority of people,

2:01:44.880 --> 2:01:48.240
 that's dollars. And so you look at the U.S. dollar price, you get all this volatility.

2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:54.880
 And the beauty of this is that 60% that doesn't move, regardless of price upward or downward in

2:01:54.880 --> 2:01:59.680
 movement, those people aren't looking at the day to day price. What they've basically said is I've

2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:05.120
 acquired X amount of Bitcoin, and I'm just going to hold it for years. And every time somebody's

2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:09.920
 done that, right? If you bought Bitcoin at any point in the last 12 years, and you held it till

2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:16.640
 today, you are up in U.S. dollar terms. Now, if we had this conversation 18 months ago,

2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:21.920
 couldn't say that. So it's all about not only the acquisition price, if you will,

2:02:22.480 --> 2:02:26.480
 it's also when are you looking at it, right? Because there was a point in 2017, you could have

2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:31.280
 said the same thing, but in 18, you couldn't. And so I tend to think a lot about humans are

2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:37.200
 really, really bad at short term decision making, because we're so emotional, especially when

2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:42.480
 something has a price tied to it. So in terms of our strategies and decision making, we should be

2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:49.040
 long term and have like a regular, almost think like an algorithm in that kind of way. So I think

2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:53.520
 you've tweeted that you believe that Bitcoin has a chance of reaching 1 million. I don't know what

2:02:53.520 --> 2:03:01.760
 it is currently, I think it's 60, which is incredible. I think I remember when it was,

2:03:01.760 --> 2:03:06.320
 at least in the double digits, I think I remember it was in the signal digits of a dollar. So the

2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:14.320
 fact that it's crossed 50 is crazy. But you're even crazier apparently thinking that it can reach

2:03:14.320 --> 2:03:18.560
 a million. So do you think it's possible for it to reach a million? Is there some kind of

2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:23.920
 transformative effects we'll have to see first? When might it reach a million? Like what are the

2:03:23.920 --> 2:03:28.880
 signs that we would look for what's required for it to reach a million? So let's just look at it

2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:35.520
 from a macro perspective. Gold is a $10 trillion asset. And when you compare the technology of

2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:41.200
 gold to the technology of Bitcoin, Bitcoin is superior in every single way. It's more portable,

2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:47.600
 it's more divisible, it's more verifiable, it's more scarce on everything. And so some people would

2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:51.840
 argue it's a 10x improvement. Some people argue it's a 100x improvement from a technology standpoint.

2:03:52.400 --> 2:04:01.200
 And so we don't need Bitcoin to actually capture the full 10x or 100x improvement from a

2:04:01.200 --> 2:04:08.240
 market cap standpoint. If Bitcoin simply captures 2x the value, it'd be a $20 trillion market cap,

2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:11.520
 which would put Bitcoin at about a million dollars, right? So kind of just from a macro

2:04:11.520 --> 2:04:16.720
 perspective, if you have a 10x or 100x improvement from a technology standpoint, and you directionally

2:04:16.720 --> 2:04:22.640
 get some value capture in that direction, you're hitting around a million or more dollar price

2:04:22.640 --> 2:04:27.920
 point. Can ask a cool question, which is, what's the current market cap for Bitcoin?

2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:31.440
 The current market cap is right around a trillion, just over a trillion dollars. And you're saying

2:04:31.440 --> 2:04:37.760
 gold is 10 trillion. And sorry, where did you get the 20 trillion? 20 trillion would just be

2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:42.720
 2x gold market cap. Got it. Right. So if it's a 10x technology improvement, let's just say it only

2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:48.160
 captures 2x the market cap. Got it. Right. And so again, if it was to capture just gold market cap,

2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:52.720
 kind of the equivalent puts you around $500,000, right? So you can kind of see there's a Bitcoin.

2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:59.040
 So if you capture the entirety of the gold market, then it would be value of a single Bitcoin.

2:04:59.040 --> 2:05:06.960
 The price of a single Bitcoin would be $500,000. Okay. To reach a million, it would be double that.

2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:11.760
 That's where the 20 trillion comes from. Correct. Got it. So if you then say to yourself,

2:05:11.760 --> 2:05:19.360
 okay, how does the pricing kind of cycles work, right? Or the boom and bust cycles?

2:05:19.360 --> 2:05:29.120
 Gold is a very kind of linear type supply schedule, meaning that there is a certain amount of gold

2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:35.280
 that comes out of the ground each year. The interyear variation in that incoming supply

2:05:35.280 --> 2:05:39.360
 is not much, right? Maybe there's an extra mining company that gets set up or a couple of them,

2:05:39.360 --> 2:05:43.120
 or maybe one goes out of business. But for the most part, the kind of inflationary

2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:52.320
 increase to the supply of gold is pretty stagnant year over year. Bitcoin has a very unique feature,

2:05:52.320 --> 2:05:58.400
 which every four years, there is a programmatic supply shock, meaning that in the beginning,

2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:03.120
 50 Bitcoin every 10 minutes was introduced into the supply. After four years of that happening

2:06:03.120 --> 2:06:09.280
 every 10 minutes, it was cut in half. So in a single moment, it went from 50 to now it was 25.

2:06:09.280 --> 2:06:14.160
 Four years every 10 minutes, 25, got cut in half again to 12 and a half. And then recently in May

2:06:14.160 --> 2:06:21.440
 2020, got cut to 6.25. When you have an asset that is determined the price based on supply and

2:06:21.440 --> 2:06:26.800
 demand, you normally have two inputs to the equation. What is the supply and what is the demand?

2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:34.160
 In an asset like gold or a stock or anything else, we have to do our best guess at the supply,

2:06:34.160 --> 2:06:38.480
 both the existing supply and the incoming supply, and do our best guess at the demand.

2:06:38.480 --> 2:06:42.320
 And we're actually pretty good at this a lot of times in terms of directionally saying it's

2:06:42.320 --> 2:06:46.960
 going to go up or down and here's kind of some price point milestones. Bitcoin's unique in that

2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:55.360
 there's 100% verifiable proof of the existing supply, the total supply, and the incoming daily

2:06:55.360 --> 2:07:00.640
 supply. So we know 100% that can show you on the actual blockchain or in the code that there's

2:07:00.640 --> 2:07:06.800
 21 million Bitcoin. And that's all there will ever be. I can show you that there's 18.6 million

2:07:06.800 --> 2:07:11.280
 give or take Bitcoin that actually are in circulation today. And I can go all the way back

2:07:11.280 --> 2:07:14.240
 to show you every single transaction that's ever occurred since January through 2009.

2:07:14.240 --> 2:07:17.840
 And then I can show you on a daily basis that 900 Bitcoin a day are coming into the circulating

2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:24.000
 supply. And so when you have 100% confidence because you can prove the supply side of this

2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:30.800
 equation, you can hold it constant. I know with 100% accuracy the supply side. So now I've reduced

2:07:30.800 --> 2:07:36.640
 the mathematical equation that I need to do to determine price movements to a 50% reduction.

2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:40.880
 I only have to worry about demand. I don't have to worry about supply. And so when I look at demand,

2:07:40.880 --> 2:07:45.120
 I can do all kinds of things. I can take the demand over the last 10 years and the growth and

2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:50.720
 just extrapolate it out. I can increase it, I can decrease it, whatever. But what you find is that

2:07:50.720 --> 2:07:57.600
 these supply shocks lead to significant price appreciation as the asset gets repriced because

2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:03.120
 there's a supply shock to them. And so probably the best thing that I've done over the last couple

2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:08.400
 of years was in 2019, I started to talk about the idea that we were going to have both a supply

2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:17.120
 shock and the demand shock in 2021. Or I'm sorry, in 2020. I didn't know when this bull market that

2:08:17.120 --> 2:08:21.440
 we were in was going to, nobody knows, right? It's impossible to time these things. But you could

2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:25.520
 tell that we were kind of at late stages of a cycle. There was inverted yield curves, there was

2:08:26.160 --> 2:08:30.720
 gyrations in the repo markets, a lot of CEOs leaving their jobs, you know, all this kind of stuff.

2:08:30.720 --> 2:08:35.120
 And all I said was at some point, when the market turns over, the government's going to have to

2:08:35.120 --> 2:08:38.720
 step in. We were addicted to stimulus. They're going to have to pay interest rates down,

2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:43.120
 they're going to have to print money. I had no clue that there was going to be a global pandemic,

2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:47.680
 that they were going to have to step in in such an aggressive way and move rates not down, but

2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:51.680
 down to zero, and that they not only were going to print hundreds of billions, but they could print

2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:58.080
 trillions of dollars. But the framework that I used to think about this was when they do that,

2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:03.680
 everyone is going to run to store value assets. They're going to run the gold, they're going to

2:09:03.680 --> 2:09:08.480
 run the Bitcoin, et cetera. And right as they do that, it appears at the same time there's going

2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:11.840
 to be this supply shock. So you're going to get a supply shock and a demand shock that are both

2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:17.440
 positive for the price. And I call it rocket fuel for Bitcoin. Well, it happened. And here we are.

2:09:18.720 --> 2:09:22.880
 I now look forward and I say, okay, we are likely going to see 100,000 Bitcoin,

2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:26.720
 $100,000 Bitcoin this year, right at some point. I don't know when it happens, but we're moving

2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:33.040
 in that direction. So you think in 2021 we'll see 100,000? That would be my most conservative view.

2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:39.680
 I've said $100,000 since 2019 and people thought that was insane and crazy and all stuff.

2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:44.080
 Now I'm the conservative guy in the room because I stick with $100,000 and people are saying,

2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:50.160
 multiples of that number. So we'll see what happens. But I think that there's still a lot

2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:56.320
 of room to run from a US dollar price standpoint. What is on the horizon is in 2024, we will have

2:09:56.320 --> 2:10:01.360
 another supply shock. And so that's what I think will carry us to the million dollar Bitcoin price.

2:10:01.360 --> 2:10:07.280
 From 625 to whatever. 50% reduction. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's what I think will basically,

2:10:07.280 --> 2:10:13.200
 when we get that next supply shock, that'll carry us up over a $1 million Bitcoin price,

2:10:13.200 --> 2:10:19.040
 which if historical examples persist, and again, sometimes it's hard to use historical

2:10:19.040 --> 2:10:25.280
 examples to look at future events. But if that happens, we would see a million dollars of Bitcoin

2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:33.440
 by the end of 2026. After that wave. So 2024 basically is the supply shock and within 18 to

2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:39.680
 24 months, you would see the top of the next market. Hopefully without a coupling to another

2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:44.880
 pandemic. Yes, we would like to do all of this without a public health crisis.

2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:51.520
 So that would take it to 20 trillion. You don't have to compare it to the dollar

2:10:51.520 --> 2:10:56.480
 essentially in some sense, that the dollar could also lose value. I mean, there's a lot of kind

2:10:56.480 --> 2:11:03.680
 of dynamics at play here. But like fundamentally, there's going to be a huge move in your prediction

2:11:03.680 --> 2:11:08.800
 of value into Bitcoin. I mean, that's a fascinating world to think about.

2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:17.200
 I mean, but I do have to kind of ask you about the whole space of technology there because

2:11:17.200 --> 2:11:22.480
 we're talking about the value of security, we're talking about the future, which Bitcoin will be

2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:30.240
 at the center of. But from my perspective of thinking how like I and others can build technologies

2:11:30.240 --> 2:11:36.320
 on top of this kind of decentralized world, I'm thinking about different technologies out there,

2:11:36.320 --> 2:11:42.480
 different cryptocurrencies out there, Ethereum being one, but there's a lot of others. So I'd

2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:48.000
 love to get your sort of ideas about some of these. But so first, let me ask you about what the hell

2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:56.160
 is shitcoin? Is this connected to our previous discussion of the meme? Does shitcoin cover

2:11:56.160 --> 2:12:05.840
 basically all coins that are not Bitcoin? Is it mean? Is it beautiful? Is it a mixture of both?

2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:16.160
 As with most things in life, depends who you ask. The most kind of enthusiastic and

2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:23.440
 parts of the Bitcoin community, shitcoin is anything else. If you ascribe to kind of a

2:12:23.440 --> 2:12:28.080
 maximalistic view of the world, shitcoin won't be anything. If you look at people who I would say

2:12:28.080 --> 2:12:36.240
 are Bitcoin proponents, yet see value in other things, shitcoin may be the bottom half of the

2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:41.600
 other things. So I think again, it's really important kind of who you ask is how you'll get

2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:45.680
 that answer. So there's tiers and the way you divide those tiers might be different depending

2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:53.600
 who you ask. Ultimately, what it is is it's a meme. And it's used to articulate the idea that

2:12:53.600 --> 2:12:58.240
 whatever you want to put in that bucket has no value. So shitcoin are coins that have no value.

2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:05.040
 What is fascinating about it, and I think that again speaks to the power of the Bitcoin community,

2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:11.280
 is there was congressional hearings a couple of years ago. And at one point, a congressman

2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:17.120
 from Ohio, Warren Davidson, who was definitely open minded and excited about Bitcoin,

2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:25.840
 asked an individual on the congress floor during testimony to talk about these other coins. And

2:13:25.840 --> 2:13:30.640
 at one point, basically read into the record, the terminology of shitcoin.

2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:36.800
 He said the word shitcoin. I can't remember if he said it first or if the other person did,

2:13:36.800 --> 2:13:42.640
 and then he repeated it. That's awesome. But he definitely, he was trying to get that read into

2:13:42.640 --> 2:13:51.280
 the record, for sure. And so you can imagine, one, again, the meme speaking insolently to the

2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:59.040
 Bitcoin community was made him very well liked. But also two was it does go back to this idea

2:13:59.040 --> 2:14:05.760
 almost of if you and I sat down with 10 CEOs, and we interviewed each one of them. And then we went

2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:09.280
 in a room and we deliberated and we said, we have to pick the person who's going to be the most

2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:14.240
 successful. One of the inputs, not all the inputs, but one of the inputs would be who's the person

2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:20.880
 who we believe has the best ability to raise capital, recruit people and tell a story to the

2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:27.200
 world that will get them to follow. And so somebody like Elon would probably be the best example of

2:14:27.200 --> 2:14:33.680
 this. When you have decentralized products, you have no kind of leader, right, in the sense of

2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:39.280
 somebody who is financially ascribed to be that leader and kind of the executive decision maker.

2:14:39.280 --> 2:14:42.480
 So what you have to do is you have to look at these technologies in these communities and say,

2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:50.000
 well, which volunteer teams or which technologies have been able to coalesce these groups around it

2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:55.600
 and in some way build the same level of engagement and protection and things like that.

2:14:56.320 --> 2:15:00.800
 And so you naturally get tribalism, but you also get things like

2:15:00.800 --> 2:15:08.880
 shitcoin because what it does is it's not only a kind of verbal attack towards others,

2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:16.560
 it's a rallying cry for internal. What's so funny is that it was started with the Bitcoin community

2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:20.320
 talking about everybody, but now you've seen adoption in other communities who use it,

2:15:20.320 --> 2:15:23.600
 you know, basically say, well, we're not a shitcoin, it's the next guy.

2:15:23.600 --> 2:15:32.000
 Yeah, I mean, the meaning, to be honest, it's sometimes misused. I think like with anything,

2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:37.520
 it's like people adopt memes that used to be brilliant or still brilliant,

2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:46.000
 and they're just not good at using them so they become mean. But when you do with grace,

2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:52.320
 it can tear down an argument and at the same time have like love and respect underneath it.

2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:57.920
 I mean, it's a beautiful dance they have to be good at. Like people just can suck at communication

2:15:57.920 --> 2:16:05.760
 and even a powerful weapon like a meme in the wrong hands just fires in a way that

2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:12.080
 doesn't get anything done. But this is like a war of humor and memes. It's kind of fascinating,

2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:16.880
 exactly like you formulated that there's asymmetry of power. So you have to have

2:16:16.880 --> 2:16:22.720
 guerrilla warfare in this internet game, especially when there's no leader,

2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:24.320
 like you said, in a distributed culture.

2:16:24.320 --> 2:16:29.920
 The thing I would say here that is really important, I think, is from a society standpoint,

2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:38.800
 we've become very soft and very kind of coddling and not in a way that's like,

2:16:38.800 --> 2:16:42.240
 I think people take this argument like too far sometimes, but what I mean by that is

2:16:42.240 --> 2:16:48.080
 it's almost like if you're the person who holds somebody accountable, you become the bad person.

2:16:48.720 --> 2:16:55.840
 If you're the person who says, hey, that's wrong, you're the bad person. And so in a world where

2:16:55.840 --> 2:17:03.840
 I think in this kind of influence, all positive, if you have any negative feedback or constructive

2:17:03.840 --> 2:17:10.880
 criticism like you're the bad person, it's the ultimate echo chamber. And so I think that what

2:17:10.880 --> 2:17:19.280
 the Bitcoin world does in some crazy, crazy way to look at it is Bitcoin is ultimately about truth,

2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:27.760
 not about narrative, not about feelings or emotion. It's math. You look at a blockchain

2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:34.480
 and you can prove something or you can't. And so naturally, people who are attracted to that

2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:40.480
 have a very similar approach in life. They say, hey, you made X claim, prove it. And as you can

2:17:40.480 --> 2:17:48.480
 imagine, a great example is the financial media meets Bitcoiners. And it's a bloodbath in kind of

2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:55.360
 the arena of ideas because what do they do? The financial media is used to the soft opinion pieces,

2:17:55.360 --> 2:18:00.560
 etc. And Bitcoiners show up and they're like, here's data point A, B, and C. Here's example one,

2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:04.480
 two, and three, and you're wrong. And then all they yell and scream about is like,

2:18:05.680 --> 2:18:09.680
 I'm wrong. I'm wrong. I'm wrong. You can't say I'm wrong. And they're like, no, just prove what I

2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:14.000
 just said. And so you get in this like very, very weird. It's fascinating. It's a fascinating benefit.

2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:21.360
 But I do want to say, I've been watching this, it's kind of interesting. I think that the pursuit

2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:30.240
 of truth through like tearing down bad ideas can be done with grace. And to do it with grace

2:18:30.240 --> 2:18:36.960
 requires a lot of skill. Like what people don't realize about disagreement, they think that

2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:46.560
 disagreement is easy. They see the lies or the inaccuracies in the statement and they just think

2:18:46.560 --> 2:18:56.160
 they can say wrong. Yes, you can say that. But if you want to be effective, it requires great skill.

2:18:56.160 --> 2:19:04.240
 Like you look at, I don't know, a beautiful verbal shit poster, which is Christopher Hitchens,

2:19:04.240 --> 2:19:12.880
 right? It requires a lot of skill through your words to tear down an argument, to criticize,

2:19:13.520 --> 2:19:20.000
 and to take a step towards truth. What I'm disheartened by internet culture, like the negative

2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:27.440
 side is people don't put a lot of effort in their tear downs. Like into your shitposting,

2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:34.640
 into your memes, you should put effort and see it as a skill that you want to, if you want to

2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:41.760
 be a part of this culture, you want to get good at it, like any skill. It's a 10,000 hours,

2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:48.880
 like get improve, deliberate practice, self criticism, all of those things. Just because

2:19:48.880 --> 2:19:55.120
 you're anonymous doesn't mean you won't get deep joy and actually have an impact on the world if

2:19:55.120 --> 2:20:00.560
 you get good at shitposting. But I think this is really, really important, right? Because you're

2:20:00.560 --> 2:20:06.560
 right in that it's all about intention versus action. If your intention is to tell somebody

2:20:06.560 --> 2:20:11.920
 that they are wrong in an effort to get them to see the truth, that's very different than if your

2:20:11.920 --> 2:20:16.320
 intention is to tell someone they're wrong and hurt their feelings, right? And so when you can

2:20:16.320 --> 2:20:22.080
 unpack intention and action, you really quickly can tell what somebody ultimately is trying to

2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:29.520
 accomplish. I also think that one of the craziest things that I've seen play out is memes when I

2:20:29.520 --> 2:20:32.960
 use that term, I'm not just talking about like a static photo, right? When I'm talking about these

2:20:32.960 --> 2:20:43.280
 elaborate, kind of edited videos and kind of all this stuff. When done right, it is the most

2:20:43.280 --> 2:20:49.840
 articulate way to deliver a blunt message. And it's done in such a way that is humorous and

2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:57.360
 entertaining, yet really hammers the point, huh? And so it's a skill set that many people don't

2:20:57.360 --> 2:21:01.520
 have. I don't make those. I'm assuming you don't make them either, right? I see them. I share the

2:21:01.520 --> 2:21:07.600
 ones that I like, right? But it does take practice. And you can tell, look, there's people who are

2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:14.240
 fantastic meme lords. And there are people who absolutely suck at it. And it's like anything.

2:21:14.240 --> 2:21:20.800
 It's just how good are you at communicating? And I've heard the idea a bunch of times, so I don't

2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:26.480
 know who to kind of credit for it. But whether it's emojis, it's gifts, it's memes, whatever,

2:21:27.280 --> 2:21:33.520
 this is the extension and evolution of just hieroglyphics, right? Like we have been doing

2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:37.760
 this for literally centuries. It's just that now we're doing it on the internet and you can press

2:21:37.760 --> 2:21:43.120
 a button and go to millions and millions of people immediately. But speaking of memes,

2:21:43.120 --> 2:21:47.440
 what the heck do you think is up with Elon Musk talking about Dogecoin a lot?

2:21:48.240 --> 2:21:55.280
 Sort of from the cryptocurrency community, I've been talking to a lot of technologists,

2:21:55.280 --> 2:22:02.880
 I guess, and reading papers on cryptocurrency. It's like nobody really sees Dogecoin as a

2:22:02.880 --> 2:22:08.160
 revolutionary crypto technology. A lot of people talk about its security issues. There's a bunch

2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:16.000
 of issues it has. Nevertheless, you did say that money is the kind of social construct, right?

2:22:17.200 --> 2:22:25.040
 And Elon Musk's combination of humor and brilliant engineering in the various companies he runs

2:22:25.600 --> 2:22:31.920
 combines to create a kind of value and excitement behind Dogecoin. It's like,

2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:39.680
 what is it? He says that the most amusing outcome is the most likely kind of idea,

2:22:40.240 --> 2:22:46.080
 which sounds silly, but there could be like profound truth to it. It's like, what do you

2:22:46.080 --> 2:22:52.960
 make of Dogecoin philosophically or technically? Is it possible that Dogecoin will overtake Bitcoin

2:22:52.960 --> 2:23:03.760
 and run the entire world? Because it could happen. But if there's any serious way to answer that

2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:12.960
 question. Well, we have to start with Techno King of Tesla and Master of Coin, as they are

2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:17.680
 so articulately called in the latest SEC filing. Because he officially changed his title to Techno

2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:27.840
 King of Tesla and the CFO's new title is Master of Coin. And so when you have a sense of humor

2:23:29.120 --> 2:23:38.320
 and frankly, a level of self confidence and an appreciation for irony in the world,

2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:43.680
 Dogecoin is actually one of the least crazy things that you could talk about

2:23:43.680 --> 2:23:49.760
 about when you're willing to go to Techno King of Tesla, Master of Coin and all this stuff. And so

2:23:50.880 --> 2:23:55.600
 I think that Elon doesn't get enough credit, frankly, for his understanding of Internet

2:23:55.600 --> 2:24:01.280
 culture, understanding of memes, and understanding of, frankly, human psychology and marketing.

2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:08.240
 And so in some crazy way, every time he talks about Dogecoin, it's a rallying cry for an

2:24:08.240 --> 2:24:13.600
 entire generation of kids. It's a rallying cry for an entire industry in terms of cryptocurrency,

2:24:13.600 --> 2:24:21.520
 and digital technologies. But this is the flag. And this is the thing that he can yell and scream

2:24:21.520 --> 2:24:27.840
 about and tweet about without worry of punishment. So he could be talking about Bitcoin, he could

2:24:27.840 --> 2:24:34.560
 be talking about cryptocurrency, but that's not going to be as beautifully humorous and whatever

2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:39.440
 the hell Internet culture is as Dogecoin. He's finding the right language. He's speaking the

2:24:39.440 --> 2:24:46.880
 language of the people in the digital age. If you want to reach weird people, you can't be serious.

2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:54.000
 And most people are weird. The masses are weird. So he's speaking to the masses, the Techno King.

2:24:54.000 --> 2:25:02.320
 And even further than that, I think is he essentially is, he's using Dogecoin as a way

2:25:02.320 --> 2:25:11.440
 to say, I'm doing this because I can. He couldn't do it with securities. He couldn't do it with

2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:15.520
 certain types of other assets, right? I almost look at it as a Venn diagram. What's the thing

2:25:15.520 --> 2:25:20.720
 that a bunch of people know about, care about, think are funny, whatever, and also overlay that

2:25:20.720 --> 2:25:23.440
 with the things that he could actually talk about that he won't get in trouble for?

2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:30.640
 That's a big FU to the SEC. I could see the people just freaking out. I mean, I love it,

2:25:30.640 --> 2:25:37.040
 but I don't know if I would have the guts to do it myself. But I think he's an inspiration to a lot

2:25:37.040 --> 2:25:42.400
 of us to be like, well, maybe you should grow the guts. When you're the Techno King, you can do

2:25:42.400 --> 2:25:49.280
 whatever you want, right? And I mean, that's something to aspire to is to be the Techno King

2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:54.560
 in your own little world. If you also think about it in the sense of when you're somebody on a mission

2:25:54.560 --> 2:26:05.280
 to create interplanetary life, when you're trying to put a dent in the climate crisis

2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:09.360
 or create electric vehicles and be the first American company and have a long,

2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:17.920
 frankly, the SEC or other things in your life that you don't ascribe that much

2:26:17.920 --> 2:26:25.040
 importance to compared to those things, they're almost nuisances. And that's scary. I think for

2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:29.920
 shareholders of a company, when the person that you're trusting to lead you to the promised land

2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:36.720
 and create shareholder value doesn't put value on certain things. But at the same time, I always

2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:42.640
 look at it as a tug of war. How much of the actions of what he's doing and calling attention to

2:26:42.640 --> 2:26:49.040
 actually change the way that regulators, lawmakers, politicians, countries, whatever, act.

2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:56.960
 He may not be able to say, do acts, I'm the Techno King, and they go do it. But with every step he

2:26:56.960 --> 2:27:05.600
 makes, he changes some of their behavior. And so I think that it's a really kind of game of like

2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:11.600
 3D chess that, frankly, I'm not privy to, right? And I'm kind of watching from the sidelines and

2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:18.960
 figuring out alongside everybody else. But I also don't think that it's just Elon bought a bunch of

2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:22.400
 Dogecoin and tweets about it because he thinks he's going to do a dollar and he's going to make

2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:27.440
 money. I don't think it's an economic argument as to why he's so interested in it. I think it's

2:27:27.440 --> 2:27:32.960
 much more, it's almost like meta message for a lot of other stuff.

2:27:33.840 --> 2:27:38.640
 Yeah, he's kind of trying to break apart internet communication from first principles,

2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:41.840
 like he does so many other problems. It's kind of fascinating to watch. I know he's been,

2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:51.760
 he's taught me quite a bit about communication. And at least for me, it's been liberating to not

2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:58.720
 give a fuck about the old school way of things. I've been always bothered by a place I deeply

2:27:58.720 --> 2:28:05.040
 admire, which is MIT. But there's problems, bureaucracies and hierarchies that hold back

2:28:05.040 --> 2:28:12.720
 innovation brilliant minds. And in that sense, Doge is a kind of FU to the system that's kind

2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:23.120
 of positive, but also kind of, but it was also an FU. So in that sense, I think Elon has a

2:28:23.120 --> 2:28:28.160
 perspective on the world that's similar to Bitcoin folks, which I really like, which is

2:28:28.160 --> 2:28:37.600
 like thinking long term, how visionaries think is like how, if I take these ideas, and the ideas

2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:44.880
 hold true, what will the world look like in 20, 30, 50 years? And think about everything in that way.

2:28:45.440 --> 2:28:54.080
 Yeah, I like Bezos's view, which is essentially how do you minimize regret? How do you accelerate

2:28:54.080 --> 2:29:00.240
 your life mentally and go to 80, 90, 100, 150 years, whatever we end up being fortunate enough

2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:06.320
 to live to, and then look backwards? And say this decision that I'm going to make, I have two

2:29:06.320 --> 2:29:11.840
 options. Which one is going to be the one that I least regret? And if you continue to make decisions

2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:16.160
 that way, one, you have that long term view kind of built in because you're working backwards,

2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:24.080
 two, you are ultimately going to optimize for minimal regret. But also three is, even if you

2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:28.640
 only look forward 10 years, that's much, much further than most people do. And so it gives

2:29:28.640 --> 2:29:35.360
 you a significant advantage. And I think that Bitcoin has kind of this proxy for time, as we

2:29:35.360 --> 2:29:42.720
 talked about, interplanetary travel, where there's multiple steps from creating a reusable rocket

2:29:42.720 --> 2:29:47.680
 to landing it to, you know, all this stuff, all the way to simple things, just like,

2:29:48.480 --> 2:29:51.520
 if you're simply trying to figure out where the world's going to be 30 years from now,

2:29:52.480 --> 2:29:56.640
 you know, Bill Gates says that we overestimate what we can do in one year, underestimate what

2:29:56.640 --> 2:30:06.160
 we can do in 10. Well, to me, it's a kind of degree of mistake, if you will, 10 years, maybe you're

2:30:06.160 --> 2:30:14.080
 off by 10%. Well, if that line of progress continues 20 years, you may be off by 100%. And 30 years,

2:30:14.080 --> 2:30:19.200
 you may be off by 1000%. Right? Like, like, almost the further you go out, the more inaccurate you

2:30:19.200 --> 2:30:26.400
 become. And so I think that people who want to iterate their way to success, right, that's a

2:30:26.400 --> 2:30:33.600
 common thing in like the startup world, end up actually following kind of the breadcrumbs to

2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:40.160
 where the world is taking them. But people like an Elon Musk, a Jeff Bezos, a Jack Dorsey, all the

2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:45.520
 way down the line, all these innovators, they actually say to themselves, there is a point

2:30:45.520 --> 2:30:51.520
 in time in the future, where there's a world I want to construct. And then they go and they construct

2:30:51.520 --> 2:30:57.600
 it, regardless of the short term iterations and incentives, it is just they're driving towards

2:30:57.600 --> 2:31:02.880
 that point. And I think that it's this whole idea of having this like, you know, kind of set vision

2:31:02.880 --> 2:31:08.800
 and this refusal to kind of move or budge off of that. That's what makes them special.

2:31:10.400 --> 2:31:17.680
 One of the things that garnered a lot of excitement in the crypto community is NFTs. I

2:31:17.680 --> 2:31:24.560
 have no idea really the depths, the fundamental technological, philosophical depths of this

2:31:25.360 --> 2:31:30.160
 technology, whether this is just like a little bit of a fad, or if there's some deep lessons to

2:31:30.160 --> 2:31:34.560
 learn, whether it's Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general about it. Do you have thoughts about

2:31:34.560 --> 2:31:41.200
 like the long lasting fundamental aspects of NFTs? I think there's probably both things happening,

2:31:41.200 --> 2:31:48.640
 fad and things to learn, right? And if we just start with like, what is an NFT, it's a non fungible

2:31:48.640 --> 2:31:55.760
 token, meaning that there's no fungibility and fungibility is a fancy word. I always describe

2:31:55.760 --> 2:31:59.440
 it as if I took $100 bill and I put it on the table with a bunch of other $100 bills and we

2:31:59.440 --> 2:32:04.320
 mixed them up and I just grabbed a $100 bill and left. I'm no worse as long as they're all,

2:32:04.320 --> 2:32:09.280
 you know, official $100 bills, because as long as I have $100, I have $100. I don't need that

2:32:09.280 --> 2:32:14.560
 exact same bill back. So that means that those $100 bills are fungible. Non fungible would be

2:32:14.560 --> 2:32:18.800
 like art. If I took a Picasso and I put it down on the table and you brought three artists that

2:32:18.800 --> 2:32:22.160
 no one's ever heard of before and we mixed them up and I just took any random piece of art and

2:32:22.160 --> 2:32:26.880
 it wasn't the Picasso, I lose because the Picasso is really important there, right? So the non fungibility

2:32:26.880 --> 2:32:33.840
 is important in art. What these non fungible tokens essentially are doing is they are creating

2:32:33.840 --> 2:32:42.000
 scarcity and originality in a digital environment. And what I mean by that is take a music file.

2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:46.960
 If I had a music file and you wanted it, you said send it to me, I press send. It essentially

2:32:46.960 --> 2:32:51.440
 creates a copy and you get one music file, I get another. We don't care. You can listen to music,

2:32:51.440 --> 2:32:58.080
 I can listen to music. We're super happy. If I instead though have a digital file that entire

2:32:58.080 --> 2:33:04.160
 premise is based on scarcity and I hit send and you get a copy and I keep the original or you get

2:33:04.160 --> 2:33:10.400
 the original and I get a copy, there's a problem. And so ultimately what I think is playing out with

2:33:10.400 --> 2:33:18.080
 NFTs is it's a technology regardless of where it plays out from blockchains or what in communities

2:33:18.080 --> 2:33:25.840
 or environments that just brings true digital scarcity to the internet. And so naturally what

2:33:25.840 --> 2:33:30.400
 do people do? They look at the legacy world and they say, well, what's scarce there that has value?

2:33:30.400 --> 2:33:34.320
 How do we bring that to the digital world? So art is a perfect example, right? And,

2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:38.320
 you know, frankly, last year I started to look at this because it felt like this was going to be

2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:46.080
 really, really big. And the conclusion I came to was just as Bitcoin is going to be bigger than

2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:50.960
 gold, right? The digital application of something is going to be bigger than the analog application.

2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:54.480
 The same thing is going to be true in art. The digital art world is going to be bigger than

2:33:54.480 --> 2:33:58.640
 the traditional art world. People think that sounds crazy at first until you start to realize

2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:05.040
 it's very, very similar. The art is more portable. It can be divisible, right? It's got a larger

2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:09.120
 demand market in terms of the internet rather than an auction, right? All this kind of stuff.

2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:15.520
 When you display it, it can have motion and music and all of these aspects to it that are better

2:34:15.520 --> 2:34:20.080
 than the traditional art. What the traditional art market has that the digital art market has not

2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:27.280
 had is the narrative. Narrative based world, scarcity kind of in digital sense. And so

2:34:28.480 --> 2:34:33.360
 what I think the entire world is going through right now is an exploration of how do we use this

2:34:33.360 --> 2:34:41.120
 technology to create new things. Frankly, we're not going to be good at it for a while. And so

2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:48.400
 the only place I've really focused on is digital art itself. And I've always been interested in art,

2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:53.360
 but I wasn't going to go buy a painting and hang it on the wall, right? In the sense of

2:34:53.360 --> 2:34:58.720
 that's how I was going to store value. What I find fascinating though is that I now can take

2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:04.320
 that concept, which most of the wealthiest people in the world have a significant portion.

2:35:04.320 --> 2:35:09.680
 Some people have 20% in terms of number of billionaires, 20% of their wealth is in art.

2:35:09.680 --> 2:35:15.920
 And you can bring to this digital realm, which is much more kind of natural to a digital native.

2:35:16.880 --> 2:35:21.520
 And so the best way I know how to describe the importance is imagine a serial number

2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:27.280
 being placed on something. Take the Eiffel Tower. The only Eiffel Tower that has value is the first

2:35:27.280 --> 2:35:33.200
 one. Every replica of it, regardless of size, location, you know, who made it, where they

2:35:33.200 --> 2:35:39.200
 sent it, they have no value. Eiffel Tower 001 is the most important. And so I think that's

2:35:39.200 --> 2:35:44.880
 ultimately what we're starting to see here. And what we're looking at is probably 1% of what it's

2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:50.560
 going to grow into, who the players are. You're bullish. You're saying it could grow into something

2:35:50.560 --> 2:35:55.120
 for 1%. It could grow into something significant, like all the kinds of different applications.

2:35:55.120 --> 2:35:58.400
 Strip away all of the applications right now and just think about,

2:35:58.400 --> 2:36:00.880
 is digital scarcity going to be important on the internet?

2:36:00.880 --> 2:36:04.240
 Moving all the things that are scarce in the physical world into digital space,

2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:08.400
 us trying to figure out which things can be moved and not. And also there are things in

2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:13.280
 the digital space just like you're saying that don't exist in the physical world that might also

2:36:13.280 --> 2:36:20.240
 benefit from gaining scarcity. People are, I guess, creating NFTs out of tweets or whatever.

2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:27.520
 So you have a fun Twitter account. You could say you could put value to a single tweet and then

2:36:27.520 --> 2:36:31.680
 be able to invest in it and trade it and buy parts of it and all those kinds of things.

2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:40.160
 You can invest in people. You can invest in art can be defined broadly as any kind of creation.

2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:49.200
 In some sense, this whole idea of scarcity can overtake the entirety of the digital world.

2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:57.040
 It can consume all of the markets we see as financial markets and just turn everything

2:36:57.040 --> 2:37:05.280
 into a market. Well, so if I take you on like a 10 year fast forward and I paint a picture of

2:37:05.840 --> 2:37:10.080
 something today that seems absolutely insane, but there's early signs that people are building

2:37:10.080 --> 2:37:14.080
 this and let's just give them the benefit of the doubt that some of the early iterations will work

2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:21.840
 and most of them won't. There's a world where you and I are participating in a digital economy

2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:28.320
 in a virtual world where whether it is a piece of art, it is a digital sculpture,

2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:35.680
 it is a digital skin from a video game, it is a digital good that we purchased somewhere online

2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:42.000
 and we bring it and we display it in a digital museum or a virtual museum.

2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:48.720
 And so now all of a sudden, you can charge people for entry. You can consign digital goods.

2:37:48.720 --> 2:37:53.280
 It's the replication of what happens in the analog world now just in digital and when you do that,

2:37:53.840 --> 2:38:00.480
 what you do is you take the addressable markets of these assets or these mechanisms

2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:08.560
 and they explode in the digital realm. And so now all of a sudden, how fast does the human race

2:38:08.560 --> 2:38:14.400
 accelerate when it comes to human production, intelligence, learning, all in the digital

2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:20.480
 output? It's just if I said to you 20 years ago, I'm going to give you a global education.

2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:26.560
 It means I'm going to take you and I'm going to physically move you to geography after geography

2:38:26.560 --> 2:38:31.040
 after geography. It's going to take time. It's going to take resources and ultimately it's going to

2:38:31.040 --> 2:38:37.120
 take lots of effort. If I now said to you, hey, I'm going to transport you in this virtual world

2:38:37.120 --> 2:38:45.120
 to multiple geographies, but you're going to experience it in this virtual world and you're

2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:50.720
 going to have digital goods that you can take from economy to economy or from location to location.

2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:55.440
 All of a sudden, you may get maybe you get 90% of the value. You don't get 100% of the same value.

2:38:55.440 --> 2:39:01.920
 We get 90% of the value. But you can do it at a much faster pace. And so in the six month period,

2:39:01.920 --> 2:39:07.680
 you've actually made three times the progress than you would have if you had to do in the physical

2:39:07.680 --> 2:39:14.240
 world. So that's where I think we're heading. So there's digital art being displayed in the digital

2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:20.480
 museum and people are being charged for access. And perhaps we plug in our senses, which means

2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:25.440
 we start to operate more and more in a virtual reality, augmented reality, virtual reality way

2:39:25.440 --> 2:39:32.560
 with this digital world, and increasingly go into this world, basically lived most of our productive

2:39:32.560 --> 2:39:40.080
 and social lives in this digital world, and increasingly essentially create a simulation

2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:47.680
 where the biological basis is just there to sustain the brain that's used to operate in

2:39:47.680 --> 2:39:53.360
 the virtual world. Taking us back to the original, when we started talking about war,

2:39:53.360 --> 2:40:00.320
 I wonder what conflict looks like in that world, that the people who are born today maybe will be

2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:07.680
 fighting wars in the space, in that museum world, in that digital world. Remember what I said,

2:40:07.680 --> 2:40:14.000
 we're moving from a world of conflict surrounded and determined by bombs, bullets, and soldiers

2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:22.240
 to a battlefield that is determined by war of information and cyber capabilities. And so in

2:40:22.240 --> 2:40:30.560
 that virtual world, is it about death and destruction of human life and the physical analog world?

2:40:31.200 --> 2:40:38.480
 Or will it become more important to attack or defend virtual property and virtual life and

2:40:39.280 --> 2:40:46.480
 some level of virtual sovereignty? In my opinion, the latter is more likely. And so what you start

2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:55.120
 to understand is, well, what do you truly value in your life? Is it the physical analog materialistic

2:40:55.120 --> 2:41:04.800
 consumptive goods? Or is it virtual? And in many cases, something as simple as the ability to connect

2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:12.400
 with somebody is really important. And so one of the most disruptive, combative, violent things

2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:18.960
 that a country may do to another country in the future, simply take down the internet and put

2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:24.240
 people in isolation. I don't need to physically harm you if I can psychologically harm you.

2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:35.360
 I don't need to actually convince you through a monopoly on violence, on physical violence.

2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:40.960
 What if I can psychologically change the way you see the world through misinformation,

2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:46.480
 through all sorts of nefarious activities? And I think that the United States has been struggling

2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:50.480
 with this idea over the last couple of years in the political arena. But what happens when it

2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:57.200
 starts to come to other aspects of our life? And I think it's very likely, it's almost obviously

2:41:57.200 --> 2:42:05.760
 likely that we're moving into the digital world. One of the features of the digital world is that

2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:12.320
 artificial intelligence systems can operate with much more power in a frictionless way

2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:19.600
 in that world. Currently, as we understand it, it's hard to build robots that operate at scale

2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:25.360
 and do like arbitrary large amount of impact damage or positive in the physical world.

2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:33.200
 It's much easier to do in the digital world. Do you ever think about AI systems just swimming about

2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:40.880
 doing extraordinarily powerful destructive things in the digital world? Is there something of a

2:42:40.880 --> 2:42:47.680
 concern to you or is this something into a very distant future? I think a lot of artificial

2:42:47.680 --> 2:42:55.360
 intelligence is in the name. It's simply the replication of human intelligence at scale,

2:42:55.360 --> 2:43:05.040
 automated and programmatic. Meaning that in the analog world, you could go hire a thousand

2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:12.400
 employees or in an Amazon case, hire millions of employees and set a mission or a goal and push

2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:18.960
 them to go do that. That requires recruiting, retention, training, resources, all that stuff.

2:43:18.960 --> 2:43:26.400
 In the virtual world or in this digital economy, what if you can just program the resources and

2:43:26.400 --> 2:43:33.360
 gain the same leverage and do it at scale and do it in a very programmatic way and then have them

2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:39.040
 actually make decisions in a way that doesn't require you to have thought of every single

2:43:39.920 --> 2:43:44.080
 potential scenario or edge case? That's ultimately what we're talking about when we talk about

2:43:44.080 --> 2:43:50.880
 artificial intelligence. When you look at that, when technology is created, everyone uses it for

2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:57.040
 good or bad, but both get used. Whether we're talking about cell phones, beepers, the internet,

2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:03.600
 guns, whatever, it's always used for good and bad. The big question is, and I think that

2:44:03.600 --> 2:44:10.000
 yourself and many other people have rightfully said this, is the question really becomes,

2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:18.160
 is the negative and nefarious uses of this inadvertent potentially? Or does it actually come

2:44:18.160 --> 2:44:22.960
 from a malicious person? It's the intention malicious. To me, that's what I don't know

2:44:22.960 --> 2:44:26.800
 enough. You know much more about this and there's plenty of other people who do as well, but

2:44:28.160 --> 2:44:33.920
 I do think that there will be nefarious actors and malicious people, but we're going to treat

2:44:33.920 --> 2:44:38.720
 them the same way we've always treated people who use technology poorly. We're going to understand

2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:41.360
 it. We're going to identify it. We're going to control it, and then we're going to end up

2:44:41.360 --> 2:44:46.080
 reversing it or preventing that from doing that. It's the inadvertent things that I think are

2:44:46.080 --> 2:44:50.480
 actually the most dangerous because when you have something that can think for itself,

2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:59.360
 and there is no way to leverage a monopoly on violence for control, it's a very scary thing.

2:45:01.360 --> 2:45:06.240
 The thing that's scary to me is that it can scale arbitrarily, so it can outnumber humans

2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:15.520
 very quickly, even if it's dumber than humans. I don't know if we're able to reason about a world.

2:45:17.200 --> 2:45:23.040
 Let's look at the physical analog, where all of a sudden, let's talk about something

2:45:23.920 --> 2:45:30.240
 kind of like humans, but dumber than humans like chimps. Imagine that all of a sudden chimps could

2:45:30.240 --> 2:45:40.160
 multiply arbitrarily quickly, and you could have a trillion chimps the next day when you only had

2:45:40.160 --> 2:45:46.160
 maybe a million the day before. How does that world look different? Where the fuck do all

2:45:46.160 --> 2:45:53.520
 these chimps come from? Then we can pretend to be like, well, let's hope the chimps don't get

2:45:53.520 --> 2:45:59.920
 violent because they don't seem to get violent when the resources aren't constrained, but we

2:45:59.920 --> 2:46:07.760
 don't know. The problem is it all starts by building that first chip multiplier device,

2:46:07.760 --> 2:46:14.560
 and everyone's like, okay, yeah, there's a lot of good applications. You can make all kinds of

2:46:14.560 --> 2:46:19.760
 arguments for why you have more chimps. Maybe they can help you out around the house or something

2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:26.000
 like that in the physical space, but ultimately, it's the unintended consequences that you're

2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:32.880
 referring to is you don't know what's going to happen. I'm really worried about dumb AI agents

2:46:34.800 --> 2:46:42.560
 like having impact when they're multiplied to a million to a billion and are allowed to operate

2:46:42.560 --> 2:46:49.760
 in the digital space, especially as we clearly are moving more and more of our lives into the

2:46:49.760 --> 2:46:57.520
 digital space. It's terrifying because a lot of people are terrified or concerned about

2:46:57.520 --> 2:47:04.480
 superintelligent systems. I think I'm definitely much more concerned about super dumb systems at

2:47:04.480 --> 2:47:11.040
 scale. That's terrifying. I always think about the inadvertent, but as you're talking, what it

2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:16.160
 made me think of is also the irreversible. Irreversible, that's right. It's one thing if

2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:23.120
 there's inadvertent negative impact, but we have reversibility built into a system and we can fix

2:47:23.120 --> 2:47:28.880
 our mistakes. Yeah. I think the really scary part is when you overlay inadvertent mistakes with the

2:47:28.880 --> 2:47:36.160
 irreversible aspect of it and therefore humans have no control. Yeah. If you have the trillion

2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:41.200
 chimps, they're not going to like it when you try to start killing them off.

2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:50.240
 All right, but back to Bitcoin. Those chimps in the Bitcoin community.

2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:56.640
 Anytime you bring up chimps, somebody will say, Joe Rogan entered the chat. Can I ask you about

2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:03.760
 learning about Bitcoin books and resources? Do you have an amazing podcast? That's not just

2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:08.320
 about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. It's about everything, including life, but you do have a

2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:16.400
 lot of really amazing conversations about this whole digital world. Obviously, you also have a

2:48:16.400 --> 2:48:26.640
 newsletter that's incredible on Substack. Do you have recommendations? Maybe it would be great if

2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:32.400
 you could talk about, first of all, your podcast and the newsletter, but also other resources

2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:38.400
 that you recommend people should check out in order to learn about Bitcoin. Yeah. The podcast and

2:48:39.200 --> 2:48:44.160
 email are the two most selfish things I do because the podcast is a way for me to learn from other

2:48:44.160 --> 2:48:48.480
 people. I get them to come on and tell me all the things they're thinking about and I get asked

2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:55.920
 some questions. What's it called, by the way? Just a podcast. In doing that, it really is

2:48:55.920 --> 2:49:00.160
 informative for me. I think that my whole goal is just like, if I'm learning, other people will be

2:49:00.160 --> 2:49:06.160
 learning. Then the email, I read it every morning because it forces me to collect my thoughts and

2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:12.960
 actually articulate them in somewhat of a coherent way. It's just something that is a practice that

2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:18.160
 I probably would do even if no one read it. Then by being able to publish it, what does it do? It

2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:22.720
 elicits both the good and bad responses. People will let me know if they think I'm an idiot and

2:49:22.720 --> 2:49:28.160
 they'll usually not respond if they think that it's something smart. Those two things are really

2:49:28.160 --> 2:49:33.840
 educational for me and I think kind of forced me to be able to articulate a lot of ideas.

2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:38.640
 But a lot of what I share or learn on those things come from these other resources.

2:49:38.640 --> 2:49:44.640
 So I'm definitely subscribing. People should subscribe. But what are Bitcoin resources books

2:49:44.640 --> 2:49:49.680
 that you recommend? I think you got to start with Bitcoin standard. That one to me feels like

2:49:49.680 --> 2:49:56.800
 it really lays out the picture nicely. There is Bitcoin money you can't fuck with. I was written

2:49:56.800 --> 2:50:02.080
 by my friend Jason Williams. As you can imagine, it's basically what it talks about. There's another

2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:08.640
 book, Layered Money. It's written by Nick, who's done a great job kind of laying it out. There's

2:50:08.640 --> 2:50:14.400
 a book called Bitcoin in Black America written by a guy, Isaiah Jackson. He basically lays out the

2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:20.720
 argument for why the black community can benefit in an asymmetric way from something like Bitcoin.

2:50:20.720 --> 2:50:26.000
 And there's a whole bunch more. I'm going to forget them all. There's the, I think it's called The Cost

2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:32.560
 of Tomorrow. A guy, Jeff Booth, wrote it. And just if you get on Twitter, basically,

2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:39.280
 you're going to see all these books flying around. But I do have to say that from a psychological

2:50:39.280 --> 2:50:45.440
 concept or philosophical concept, the number one book that I've ever read that aligns with

2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:49.680
 Bitcoin ethos but doesn't say a word about Bitcoin is a book called The Dow of Capital by

2:50:49.680 --> 2:50:56.000
 Mark Spitznagle. And so what he essentially does is he just reiterates over and over and over again,

2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:02.000
 long term thinking, outliers, disruption, all the stuff. And so he's a guy who runs a fund

2:51:02.560 --> 2:51:09.200
 that essentially they just do tail risk hedging. And so in March or February of 2020,

2:51:09.760 --> 2:51:17.760
 they're up like 4,000%. By the way, they pretty much lose money for eight, nine years than that

2:51:17.760 --> 2:51:23.200
 happens. But they're still one of the best performing funds if you look at it over years

2:51:23.200 --> 2:51:28.560
 and years. And so it's just this mindset of everyone is so short term focused. And so I think

2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:34.720
 it's just a great reminder to long term thinking. And also, I mean, I've gotten quite a bit of

2:51:34.720 --> 2:51:39.200
 value just reading the papers. And that's perhaps more like for technical folks. There's quite an

2:51:39.200 --> 2:51:44.720
 active research community. And also going back to the original white paper and just original

2:51:44.720 --> 2:51:51.440
 documents, old school, old school is still what like what a few years ago, still really interesting

2:51:52.080 --> 2:51:59.200
 to think about, to look at what people were thinking about. Because the principles are carried

2:51:59.200 --> 2:52:06.240
 through with other cryptocurrencies as well. Like it's all, it's all there, even in the early

2:52:06.240 --> 2:52:11.120
 documents. So that's kind of fascinating to see that whole history from if you're more like tech

2:52:11.120 --> 2:52:15.840
 savvy. And like you said, Twitter is actually an interesting place. If you can look past all the

2:52:15.840 --> 2:52:23.040
 shit coin talk, it's a it's a fascinating place for news and resources. Is there books outside of

2:52:23.040 --> 2:52:28.160
 all this cryptocurrency sort of technical fiction philosophical that an impact on your life?

2:52:29.040 --> 2:52:32.960
 Because you've you have interests that are all over the place. Is there something that

2:52:33.760 --> 2:52:38.720
 you would recommend to others? So Dow Capital is definitely probably my favorite book.

2:52:38.720 --> 2:52:44.800
 Books that have been impactful. I read when I was 20, actually, sitting in the desert of Iraq,

2:52:45.680 --> 2:52:51.120
 Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Thinking Girl Rich and the Rich's Man in Babylon. And I don't think I took

2:52:51.120 --> 2:52:57.120
 a single thing and like implemented it from like an execution standpoint. But it was a complete

2:52:57.120 --> 2:53:03.680
 shift in mentality and understanding a relationship with money. And just kind of what I wanted to do

2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:07.360
 with my life and stuff like that. So I think those three books, I read them in succession,

2:53:07.360 --> 2:53:12.320
 were really impactful. And then I think one of the best books probably ever written is I think

2:53:12.320 --> 2:53:18.320
 it's called When Breath Becomes Air or air becomes breath, I can't remember. But it's basically a

2:53:18.320 --> 2:53:24.960
 doctor or medical professional who's dying. And he essentially writes about the experience and

2:53:24.960 --> 2:53:30.560
 thoughts and kind of all the stuff. And I think that it's just one of these things where if you

2:53:30.560 --> 2:53:34.160
 said to me, you know, what's the number one thing I took out of my experience in Iraq,

2:53:34.160 --> 2:53:39.840
 that's a book like that also gives you is we're all going to die, right? And you and I can want to

2:53:39.840 --> 2:53:44.240
 be as immortal as we want. But at some point, we're going to die. And so it really does kind of

2:53:44.800 --> 2:53:50.720
 focus you on time being that scarce asset and use it for enjoyment and happiness,

2:53:51.520 --> 2:53:54.960
 more so than anything else. And I think that's part of your message. And it's a great one.

2:53:56.080 --> 2:53:59.520
 Do you think you like literally meditate on your own mortality?

2:53:59.520 --> 2:54:03.280
 I necessarily think I meditate on it as much as...

2:54:03.280 --> 2:54:07.760
 Are you afraid of death? Are you afraid of death when you're in Iraq? I mean,

2:54:07.760 --> 2:54:10.560
 if you're coming face to face with it, are you afraid of death today?

2:54:10.560 --> 2:54:17.120
 No, I think that it was just one of these things where if you fixate on something and you worry

2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:26.880
 about it, then at least to me, you become uneasy about it. And so after an experience like going

2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:33.360
 to war, I think that everything is just so not important compared to that, right? When I came

2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:38.320
 back, I remember going back into the college environment and things people worried about,

2:54:38.320 --> 2:54:44.800
 I was like, listen, let me explain to you what the real world's like, right? But I think even

2:54:44.800 --> 2:54:48.960
 today, if you talk to people who know me really well, I don't get worked up about a lot of stuff.

2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:54.320
 I don't get in either direction, good or bad, anything, because ultimately, it just comes down

2:54:54.320 --> 2:55:03.440
 to if that's the final result, let's enjoy it. It's fascinating to ask you because this reformulation

2:55:03.440 --> 2:55:14.320
 of money, essentially buying time, and there's the old question of does money buy happiness?

2:55:16.080 --> 2:55:22.880
 Do you think money can buy happiness in the context of money being able to buy time?

2:55:22.880 --> 2:55:27.600
 Or is happiness something else that is beyond all of this?

2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:34.560
 When people talk about this question, I think that they really focus on money as a means to

2:55:34.560 --> 2:55:40.240
 getting materialistic things. So they want a big house, they want a boat, they want a fast car,

2:55:40.240 --> 2:55:46.720
 they want whatever. They think that's the stuff that will make them happy. What I think about it

2:55:46.720 --> 2:55:52.960
 is if you have resources, you can have time, and if you have time and you spend it the way that you

2:55:52.960 --> 2:55:57.040
 want to spend it, then that's ultimately happiness. So I always say to people, if you think that money

2:55:57.040 --> 2:56:01.760
 doesn't buy you happiness, what if I told you that if you had more money, you could spend more time

2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:09.280
 with your family? It reframes it. And now it's all about, I want to do certain things in life,

2:56:09.280 --> 2:56:15.280
 but there's a lot of people who spend their life not doing those things because they feel the need

2:56:15.280 --> 2:56:23.040
 to pursue economic means as a way to provide a living or whatever. And so I explain this. Listen,

2:56:23.040 --> 2:56:29.040
 in my opinion, again, it's my opinion, it's what makes me happy. If I can leverage financial resources

2:56:29.040 --> 2:56:35.120
 to create more time to do the things I like, I'm happier. It might not work for everybody,

2:56:35.120 --> 2:56:39.520
 but that's what works for me. And so there's this element of like, I don't care what other people

2:56:39.520 --> 2:56:44.240
 think if they like that or not, because they're not me, right? Like, there's almost this element

2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:46.880
 of like, you got to figure out what works for you. And if it works for me, then like...

2:56:48.080 --> 2:56:52.320
 No, I think that resonate, that will resonate with a lot of people. I think that's a brilliant

2:56:52.320 --> 2:57:00.080
 reframing of it. That said, you kind of imply there's a reason behind this whole existence of

2:57:00.080 --> 2:57:07.520
 ours as a meaning to it. So let me ask, what is the meaning of life, Anthony? Do you think about

2:57:07.520 --> 2:57:11.920
 these ridiculous big questions that have no answer every once in a while, or do you just

2:57:11.920 --> 2:57:19.520
 enjoy the shit out of every day? I answer it in a way that isn't meant to be accurate. It's meant to

2:57:22.400 --> 2:57:27.520
 be the right answer for me, which is ultimately... And I talked to a lot of people who always ask

2:57:27.520 --> 2:57:33.840
 like, what are you doing? Why are you doing this? I say, it's to be happy. And the reason why I think

2:57:33.840 --> 2:57:39.040
 of it that way is I've got a friend, Jonathan Geller, who talks about enough being enough.

2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:45.360
 And recently he talked about it in the context of Bitcoin. And so Bitcoiners have two things. Any

2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:48.800
 Bitcoiner, if you talk to them, they believe the same two things. One, they don't want the US dollar

2:57:48.800 --> 2:57:52.800
 price to go up because they actually want to acquire more Bitcoin, right? And then let it go

2:57:52.800 --> 2:57:56.160
 once they feel like they've got enough. But two is no matter how much they only think that they

2:57:56.160 --> 2:58:03.120
 don't own enough and they want to acquire more. And so at some point, you say to yourself, what is

2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:11.280
 enough? And I think that the whole meaning of life is to understand kind of what your level of

2:58:11.280 --> 2:58:15.120
 satisfaction is. And for some people, that's a monetary thing. Some people, that's a freedom of

2:58:15.120 --> 2:58:20.240
 time thing. For some people, it's an impact thing, whatever. But just understanding that's important

2:58:20.240 --> 2:58:25.760
 and then going and accomplishing it. And what I've found is that the people who I know who have

2:58:25.760 --> 2:58:30.080
 done this and been intentional about it, they accomplish it on a much shorter timeline than

2:58:30.080 --> 2:58:34.560
 people who don't. Some people who start thinking about it when they're 60. Naturally, you're not

2:58:34.560 --> 2:58:38.080
 going to accomplish it before you're 60 if you just start thinking about it 60. People who start

2:58:38.080 --> 2:58:41.120
 thinking about it earlier can do it. And so I think that's really it for me. It's just like

2:58:41.120 --> 2:58:45.440
 the meaning of life is to enjoy it. The way I think about it, that's because it's a really

2:58:45.440 --> 2:58:50.160
 nice formulation. I almost like to sort of oscillate back and forth. So majority of the time

2:58:51.360 --> 2:58:58.160
 is spent at the moment of enough is enough of gratitude of basically being content with where

2:58:58.160 --> 2:59:03.680
 you're at like deeply appreciative of every moment and all the Bitcoin, whatever Bitcoin you have

2:59:03.680 --> 2:59:09.280
 being deeply appreciative of it and that being enough. And then some fraction of time, perhaps

2:59:09.280 --> 2:59:14.240
 it shrinks as you get older. That's maybe there's an opto trajectory there. But some fraction of

2:59:14.240 --> 2:59:20.320
 time is spent being like deeply self critical and nothing is enough. Nothing you've ever done

2:59:20.880 --> 2:59:24.720
 is worth anything. It's the Marvin Minsky said like the secret to success

2:59:24.720 --> 2:59:31.440
 is hating everything you've ever done. So like that mode of just hating everything you've ever done

2:59:31.440 --> 2:59:36.160
 and just like trying to improve, trying to make stuff better. It's nothing is enough.

2:59:36.160 --> 2:59:40.320
 It's never enough, that kind of stuff. And then oscillating back and forth, like you don't have

2:59:40.320 --> 2:59:44.400
 to have the same algorithm operating throughout the day. You could just like oscillate back and

2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:50.320
 forth and maybe reserve that gratitude part, the chill part to when you're hanging out with

2:59:50.320 --> 2:59:56.640
 family and friends and loved ones. And then when you're like alone or maybe at work is the madman

2:59:56.640 --> 3:00:02.000
 comes out kind of thing. I also think it's kind of purpose driven in the sense of there's a lot

3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:09.120
 of people who have the I need to do more, but in a somewhat altruistic way. So they're there, you

3:00:09.120 --> 3:00:17.360
 know, take Elon as an example. The idea of colonizing Mars, sure, if he is successful,

3:00:17.360 --> 3:00:22.160
 he will be very rich. I don't think you or I or many people believe he's doing it for the money,

3:00:22.160 --> 3:00:25.120
 right? There's a lot of other things he could do that would be much easier that would make him

3:00:25.120 --> 3:00:33.680
 tons of money. And so in some weird way, he has enough because he's able to free himself from

3:00:33.680 --> 3:00:38.880
 the constraints of I need to acquire more resources and he can focus on what is the

3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:45.680
 thing that I want to work on regardless of money. And so in that pursuit that is non economic,

3:00:45.680 --> 3:00:51.600
 you can be as selfish as you want, because ultimately you're not tied back to this like

3:00:51.600 --> 3:00:59.120
 measurement tool. And so it's this again, like altruistic, non monetary purpose. And I think

3:00:59.120 --> 3:01:01.600
 that there's a lot of people who spend their whole life looking for that and they don't know what it

3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:08.160
 is. And so again, some people may not think of it that way, but if you can find something to do that,

3:01:09.040 --> 3:01:14.480
 you win. I don't think there's a better way to end it Anthony. I'm a huge fan. It's a huge honor

3:01:14.480 --> 3:01:21.440
 that you waste all this time with me today. You know, I thank you for just educating the world for

3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:27.520
 teaching me, inspire me to learn more about this new set of technologies that look like they have

3:01:27.520 --> 3:01:32.960
 a potential to change, transform all of human civilization. So thank you for coming today and

3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:37.680
 thank you for being who you are. Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me. Thanks for listening
