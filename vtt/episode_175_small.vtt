00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
 The following is a conversation with Yannis Papas, a comedian who cohosted the podcast

00:05.680 --> 00:11.120
 History Hyenas that I came across when I was researching the Battle of Crete from World War II.

00:11.920 --> 00:19.360
 He and his cohosts were hilarious in their rants about history and about life. The chemistry they

00:19.360 --> 00:24.560
 have is probably the best of any cohosted comedy podcast or even podcast in general

00:24.560 --> 00:31.040
 that I've ever heard. As of a few weeks ago, unfortunately, History Hyenas is no more,

00:31.040 --> 00:37.920
 at least for now, because all good things must come to an end. But Yannis hosts a new podcast

00:37.920 --> 00:44.080
 called Long Days with Yannis Papas, plus he has a comedy special on YouTube for free.

00:44.880 --> 00:51.600
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Wine Access, Blinkist, Magic Spoon, and Indeed. Check them out

00:51.600 --> 00:57.360
 in the description to support the podcast. As a side note, let me say that some of you

00:57.360 --> 01:02.240
 have noticed that I have not spoken with too many computer scientists, physicists, biologists,

01:02.240 --> 01:07.920
 or engineers recently. The reason has to do mostly with the risk aversion of many of these folks

01:07.920 --> 01:13.920
 in the time of COVID, especially as they get closer to taking the vaccine. I'm tested several times

01:13.920 --> 01:19.520
 a week and still some people are just more willing than others to have an in person conversation in

01:19.520 --> 01:25.600
 these times. I only do these podcasts in person because I look for the possibility of a genuine

01:25.600 --> 01:32.160
 human connection. I'm willing to sacrifice a lot for that. Maybe it's silly, but I look for the

01:32.160 --> 01:38.880
 magic that Charles Bukowski writes about in his poem, Nirvana, the magic that is somehow in the air

01:38.880 --> 01:45.280
 on those rare occasions when two people meet, talk, and you notice that while on the surface,

01:45.280 --> 01:51.440
 you may be worlds apart, you're still somehow woven from the same fabric. I've had that with

01:51.440 --> 01:58.240
 many guests. Jim Keller comes to mind, but many others as well. I'm an AI person. Machine learning,

01:58.240 --> 02:03.440
 robotics, computer science is my passion. Trust me, I can't wait to be having more technical

02:03.440 --> 02:09.360
 conversations again, but I will also continue to mix in comedians, musicians, historians, and of

02:09.360 --> 02:17.200
 course, wise all seeing sages like Yanis Papas and Tim Dillon, just to keep it as Tim likes to say

02:18.080 --> 02:24.800
 fun. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Yanis Papas.

02:25.920 --> 02:32.880
 You've cohosted until recently an amazing history comedy podcast called The History Hyenas.

02:33.600 --> 02:38.240
 So you're a bit of a student of history. Yeah, an F student of history.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.720
 F student. Yeah. Okay, I thought it was more like a D minus.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.920
 D minus, yeah. Okay. Still got to repeat the grade if you get all D minuses. I actually had a 0.67

02:45.920 --> 02:51.520
 GPA average my freshman year and I had to do it again. This podcast is going to be the spectrum

02:51.520 --> 02:56.320
 of human intelligence. It runs the gamut from there to here. So this is going to set the low

02:56.320 --> 03:04.000
 bar. I'm barely sliding into human. I'm closer to chimp. And I bring that up that you're also friends

03:04.000 --> 03:12.320
 with the great, the powerful Tim Dillon. So let's talk about power and the corrupting effects of

03:12.320 --> 03:18.560
 power. Sometimes I look at Tim Dillon as he grows in power. I thought you meant he's in size.

03:20.160 --> 03:24.960
 Size, I think they're correlated. Yeah, I saw him. I've been in Austin a couple of days. I saw him

03:24.960 --> 03:29.520
 once. We had eight meals in one day. Eight meals. Yeah. So I feel like I've been here longer than

03:29.520 --> 03:35.520
 I have just because of the meals with Dylan. Kid likes biscuits and barbecue. Okay. So he's more

03:35.520 --> 03:39.920
 like, see, I was imagining Putin or something like that. He's more like the North Korean dictator.

03:41.840 --> 03:47.040
 They get along great those two. Yeah. I mean, Tim Dillon and King John Ohm would be like,

03:47.040 --> 03:51.120
 they could make like a buddy cop movie. They would get along like Lethal Weapon. That would be a good

03:51.120 --> 03:56.960
 pitch movie. Great podcast. Yeah, that would be a great podcast. Yeah. So much to talk about. So

03:56.960 --> 04:03.440
 many similar ideas about the world. So what do you think the world would look like if Tim Dillon

04:03.440 --> 04:09.600
 was given absolute power? He seems like a person that's an interesting study of the corrupting

04:09.600 --> 04:14.640
 effects of power. Yeah, you don't want to give him power. I don't even want him wearing a suit.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.720
 Like I want a guy who's as thoughtful and educated as you wearing a suit.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.520
 Suits corrupt you. You put that suit on, you start feeling that power. Definitely.

04:23.520 --> 04:27.040
 It's like, you know, yeah, I don't even want Tim Dillon in his suit. Power would,

04:27.040 --> 04:32.320
 he would kill people. He'd get rid of anything that he deemed. I mean, if you made a lobster roll

04:32.320 --> 04:36.320
 and it wasn't up to Tim Dillon's standard, he would have you executed. The entire restaurant

04:36.320 --> 04:42.480
 staff is just gone. He would have people below his food standard execute. There'd be programs,

04:42.480 --> 04:47.280
 not of people who are political dissidents, but of people who don't meet his food standard. His

04:47.280 --> 04:53.040
 cuisine standard is high and he's usually right. Do you think power does corrupt people? Yes. Like

04:53.040 --> 04:57.360
 one of the reasons we mentioned offline Joe Rogan, he's been an inspiration to me because he gets,

04:58.240 --> 05:03.360
 he gets, if you get power, just more famous and famous. And yes, probably a bit of power in terms

05:03.360 --> 05:08.560
 of influence. And he's still pretty much the same guy. I'm not sure that's going to be true

05:08.560 --> 05:13.040
 for everybody. Do you ever think, ask yourself for that question? Yeah, he's a rare breed.

05:13.040 --> 05:17.600
 He's like a benign king. I've, I've, most people I meet who are like really powerful are like

05:17.600 --> 05:21.760
 douchebags and that's how they got there. I think that's psychopaths have the advantage because

05:21.760 --> 05:29.040
 they don't have feelings. And Joe's a rare example. He's just a powerhouse of will. And he, I do think

05:29.040 --> 05:34.240
 about that. Yeah, I think I should be stopped right now. Just stop me right now because yeah,

05:34.240 --> 05:38.880
 power for me, I would, when people get power, they indulge. I don't think it changes anyone. It

05:38.880 --> 05:44.240
 just reveals your darkest. You know, people aren't supposed to have anything they want. You got to

05:44.240 --> 05:48.640
 be able to struggle for everything. So I would have a harem. I'd be like a Roman dictator. Yeah,

05:48.640 --> 05:51.680
 I'd be like a Roman emperor. I mean, people call them emperors. They were dictators. The most

05:51.680 --> 05:56.480
 effective leaders are dictators. I hope we get back to that. Democracy hasn't worked. I'm ready

05:56.480 --> 06:03.440
 for a succession of Caesars and I want to start with AOC. That's true. Dictators get the job done.

06:03.440 --> 06:07.120
 They do. They do. At a certain point you got, that's why social workers can only get you so far.

06:07.120 --> 06:13.760
 You need action. I was a social worker for five years and all you do is ask about medications and

06:13.760 --> 06:20.080
 you don't solve anything. I do ask myself of that because I'm more in the tech space of constructing

06:21.200 --> 06:25.920
 systems that prevent me from being corrupt because right now I'm all about love and all

06:25.920 --> 06:32.400
 about those kinds of things. But I wonder, you said it just reveals the darkness. The problem

06:32.400 --> 06:37.600
 is we might not be aware of our own darkness. I have the same feeling about money actually. I've

06:37.600 --> 06:45.120
 been avoiding thinking about money, basically constructing my moral system, my moral compass

06:45.120 --> 06:53.120
 around money. At the moment I feel a little too happy about the idea of owning some cool shiny

06:53.120 --> 06:58.720
 thing. I started to think, okay, I'm not going to own that shiny thing because I'm afraid of the

06:58.720 --> 07:03.840
 slippery slope of it. You ever think about that kind of stuff? Yeah. The funny thing about the

07:03.840 --> 07:11.920
 capitalist system is it puts sort of profit motive above beauty. You notice when you see

07:12.480 --> 07:18.560
 certain cities, especially in the old days where buildings used to be beautiful and now they're

07:18.560 --> 07:24.800
 just like boxes. They throw a kid up and it's just for all profit margin. It's the illusion of

07:24.800 --> 07:30.160
 permanence that it's like, oh, let me get as much money as I can. You're like, yeah. My dad used to

07:30.160 --> 07:35.920
 say, everyone, it's a cliche, but you can't take it with you. It's comical to me that we're here

07:35.920 --> 07:40.480
 trying to get this infinite amount. It's like Sisyphus. We're all trying to climb this hill,

07:40.480 --> 07:44.240
 but I mean, rock's going to fall on us. I think that's a healthy outlook. Yeah.

07:44.240 --> 07:50.320
 My dad always used to say before he passed, he would say you have to survive not only physically,

07:50.320 --> 07:54.160
 but you have to survive emotionally. I think a lot of people forget about the emotional part

07:54.160 --> 08:01.760
 of survival. You have to survive emotionally and humor and understanding reality in its

08:01.760 --> 08:08.880
 objective context helps with that. Accepting reality as this ephemeral thing that you're

08:08.880 --> 08:14.800
 in really just a part of, but not as significant as your ego wants you to believe is a start.

08:14.800 --> 08:19.680
 That's a good foundation for surviving emotionally. What does that mean? Surviving emotionally?

08:19.680 --> 08:25.760
 Like what's an ideal life look like for you? You can't take things too seriously. You can't

08:25.760 --> 08:29.760
 because they're ephemeral. They're not permanent. Nothing's permanent. Your bank account's not

08:29.760 --> 08:34.880
 permanent. Your problems aren't permanent. Nothing's permanent. Your abilities aren't permanent.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.720
 Your memory is not permanent. Your dick getting hard is not permanent. Can I curse on this or

08:38.720 --> 08:44.160
 just go out to dinner? Yeah. You can curse to your heart's content. Okay. Yeah. I mean,

08:44.160 --> 08:48.080
 gender's not even permanent anymore. I think I'm going to change maybe and live my second half

08:48.080 --> 08:53.200
 as another gender just to have, I'm bored with this gender. So it's like nothing is permanent.

08:53.200 --> 08:59.760
 And so accepting that emotionally is a good start to being more flexible. You got to be

08:59.760 --> 09:05.520
 flexible. Like my dad used to say, anything too stiff snaps. You got to, you know, it's a cliche

09:05.520 --> 09:09.600
 and people have said it a bunch of different ways, but Bruce Lee's right, man. Be water. Be water.

09:09.600 --> 09:17.840
 Yeah. Bukowski has this quote about love that love is a fog that fades with the first light

09:17.840 --> 09:24.400
 of reality. So he's a romantic, that guy. But that even love is a thing that just doesn't last very

09:24.400 --> 09:31.680
 long. No. You know, some people would disagree with that. Maybe morphs, like water. It changes,

09:31.680 --> 09:37.120
 right? It might not be, it might not be this, because he's mostly just loved like prostitutes,

09:37.120 --> 09:43.280
 I think. So it was kind of love. Yeah. No demand, no responsibilities. Yeah. It's a financial

09:43.280 --> 09:52.480
 transaction. Yeah. F Fhermore was ever, you mentioned your dad. He passed away two, a year

09:52.480 --> 10:00.160
 and a half ago. What did you learn from him? I love my dad. My dad, I would say my dad was my

10:00.160 --> 10:05.760
 hero. He was just my dad really embodied those values. And I think for better or worse, it's

10:05.760 --> 10:14.960
 made me who I am. My dad was a painter. He was a lawyer. He was a lieutenant in the military.

10:14.960 --> 10:20.480
 He was New Yorker. New Yorker born in Brad Brooklyn. His dad, his dad, you know, surprise owned a

10:20.480 --> 10:25.600
 diner. So that's sort of the Greek passport. That's the immigration passport for Greeks

10:25.600 --> 10:31.760
 into America. And yeah, my dad played football. He just, my dad did what he wanted. He lived

10:31.760 --> 10:36.480
 as he wanted at all costs. And I think I got that from him for better or worse. I think it's hurt me

10:36.480 --> 10:45.120
 in my pursuits. If you consider money and fame to be paramount, you know, I've always done what I

10:45.120 --> 10:48.720
 wanted. If I stopped wanting to do it, I just stopped doing it. And I think I got that from my dad.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.880
 So maybe for better or worse, that's what I learned from him. But that's a real currency,

10:52.880 --> 10:57.280
 you know, feeling like you're in love with what you're doing when you're doing it.

10:57.280 --> 11:03.440
 Maybe perhaps that's worth more than money. I don't know. You miss him? Yeah, every day. Every

11:03.440 --> 11:11.120
 day. But I'm happy that he got 91 years. It's very rare. I mean, he smoked for 60 years.

11:11.840 --> 11:16.320
 Talk about like a guy who was an outlier. I mean, he smoked like 60 years, like packs. I mean,

11:16.880 --> 11:21.280
 and he didn't die from that. He died. He had prostate cancer, which is the way men should go.

11:21.280 --> 11:25.600
 Your dick should give out. It should start from the dick. I mean, we focus so much of our life

11:25.600 --> 11:30.960
 on the dick that that's the way that's a successful life. And that's why every man eventually gets

11:30.960 --> 11:35.600
 prostate cancer, because that is the universe's way of saying like, the thing you focused on the

11:35.600 --> 11:41.280
 most is you put the most energy into is the thing that's spent. And it's going to your rotting is

11:41.280 --> 11:46.960
 going to start there. So that's a successful life. And it just spread all over his body. And he slowly

11:46.960 --> 11:50.640
 died. I was with him when he died. And that meant a lot to me because me and my brother weren't

11:50.640 --> 11:55.280
 talking at the time because we're Greeks. We're talking again. But that's how it is.

11:55.280 --> 11:59.440
 You got a few brothers, right? I got two brothers. But I wanted to make sure I was with him

12:00.080 --> 12:03.200
 when he died. And I got lucky and I was in the room with him when he died.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.400
 You were in the room with your brother and you weren't?

12:06.400 --> 12:10.560
 No, my brother wasn't there. We were kind of doing shifts. I was I was there. I spent the night the

12:10.560 --> 12:15.120
 dad my the night my dad died. He died in the early in the morning. And I heard the death

12:15.120 --> 12:21.600
 right at the last breath. And it was just I think it was he knew I was there. And I think that just

12:21.600 --> 12:25.200
 probably meant something to him. And I'm just glad I was there.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.880
 Does that make you sad that life is ephemeral, like you said?

12:28.880 --> 12:30.880
 Yeah, that you die. Yeah.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.280
 What do you think about your own death? Do you meditate on that?

12:33.840 --> 12:37.360
 I think it I think the actual if there is a point to life, it's to

12:39.600 --> 12:46.000
 hopefully not fear death to accept reality. I think that's important. I think so much goes

12:46.000 --> 12:52.480
 awry in the human condition when we lose touch with reality. Every political system that's led

12:52.480 --> 12:59.920
 to mass murder and everything, I think because it's because the the tenants of those political

12:59.920 --> 13:04.960
 philosophies ended up being utopian. They were detached from reality, detached from nature.

13:05.600 --> 13:10.880
 And so I think it's it's very important to accept and acknowledge your own mortality.

13:10.880 --> 13:16.000
 I think it's the foundation for what makes a good person, a moral person, a contributing

13:16.000 --> 13:20.880
 member of society, because it's true. True things should be the foundation of all things.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.840
 If what you believe is based on illusion, you're going to end up doing destruction.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.680
 Whether that destruction is on a scale of one to 10, you are going to be

13:29.680 --> 13:32.880
 destructive because it's not real. It's a fantasy. It doesn't exist.

13:32.880 --> 13:37.360
 See, the thing is the truth is about I don't think you can ever reach truth. Truth is about

13:37.360 --> 13:41.760
 like constantly digging and to push back on your idea that you should accept death.

13:41.760 --> 13:46.720
 I think the more honest response to death, so the least honest is to run away from it,

13:46.720 --> 13:54.320
 create illusions that help you imagine like there's not a death. The next is to accept it,

13:54.320 --> 14:01.840
 but the real honest one is to fear it because I I mean, I'm with Ernest Becker as a philosopher.

14:01.840 --> 14:08.720
 I wrote a book called Denial of Death. He says that much of the human condition is based in

14:08.720 --> 14:15.600
 the fear of mortality. That's the creative force of the human energy. Like Freud said,

14:15.600 --> 14:20.000
 do you want to sleep with your mother? He said, no, that's not what motivates you.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.960
 Maybe his mom wasn't hot though, I mean, or he wasn't Greek because apparently at a poll,

14:24.960 --> 14:28.000
 we found that all things go to bad. Yeah.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
 Thanks. Thanks for that. Thanks. I just don't know if his mom was a looker or not. I mean,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.600
 I have to Google it. All right. Yeah.

14:35.440 --> 14:40.000
 I'll look up on Google images. Yeah. No, but I think the honest, as he says,

14:40.880 --> 14:46.720
 the thing that we run away from is that there's a terror. He calls it like terror. There's

14:46.720 --> 14:52.320
 something called terror management theory that's some philosophers after him followed on that

14:52.320 --> 14:58.720
 we're basically trying to run away from this fear and acceptance is actually creating an

14:58.720 --> 15:03.920
 illusion for yourself. Like you can actually accept something as terrifying as this. So

15:03.920 --> 15:08.720
 he's more with the Stoics. The Stoics constantly meditate on their death. I mean, they, what does

15:08.720 --> 15:15.040
 that mean? I mean, it's kind of, you know, acceptance of death isn't a thing you do like

15:15.040 --> 15:20.960
 on a Monday and then you're done. It's a thing you constantly have to meditate on, like reminding

15:20.960 --> 15:25.840
 yourself, like this ride is over. It could be over today. And that's something you're,

15:26.480 --> 15:30.640
 if you think about every single day, it gives you an appreciation of Woody Allen movies,

15:30.640 --> 15:36.000
 at least. It gives you appreciation of basically everything, including Woody Allen movies, which

15:36.000 --> 15:41.280
 shows you how deep your appreciation for life could be. I've actually haven't been following

15:41.280 --> 15:46.640
 much of what Woody Allen's, but apparently he's been a troublemaker from most of his life.

15:46.640 --> 15:50.960
 He's, yeah, I mean, you know, he's caused a little bit of strife. He's left a little, yeah, he's

15:50.960 --> 15:56.960
 left a little confusion in his wake, for sure. But I mean, you know, that's another one, separate

15:56.960 --> 16:01.760
 the art from the artist. He's got, I mean, the guys will go down in history as the greatest.

16:01.760 --> 16:06.080
 He's made, I mean, a movie a year and they're all, you can always find something good about

16:06.080 --> 16:10.240
 each movie, like the dialogue or whatever. I love what you're saying. It's interesting,

16:10.240 --> 16:13.200
 but the only thing I would say to push back a little bit, since we're playing a little table

16:13.200 --> 16:18.880
 tennis here, is I don't know if it's a choice to fear death. That's more of an, it seems more

16:18.880 --> 16:24.240
 instinctual. It seems like something that nature wants you to do, because I've been in positions

16:24.240 --> 16:29.520
 where I thought I was going to die, like I've been shot and I had those moments. And then nature

16:29.520 --> 16:36.240
 also kicks in an instinct, which is acceptance, where you kind of, I don't know, it's a chemical

16:36.240 --> 16:41.520
 release or whatever. I don't know. We're robots, basically. So some sort of chemical is released

16:41.520 --> 16:47.200
 that protects you, but there is an acceptance. I don't know how much was a conscious choice,

16:47.200 --> 16:51.760
 probably very little. And that's the point I'm making is it's instinctual. We don't really

16:51.760 --> 16:55.840
 have a choice in fearing death. Otherwise, there would be no progression. We wouldn't,

16:56.400 --> 17:00.960
 all life seems to want to survive, not by choice, but by instinct.

17:02.640 --> 17:07.600
 So he argues that the fear is not the instinctual, it's not the animalistic stuff. That's the thing

17:07.600 --> 17:13.040
 that makes us special. What humans are able to do is to have a knowledge that we're going to

17:13.040 --> 17:17.920
 die one day. Animals don't have that. Animals fear is instinctual. It's like, holy shit,

17:17.920 --> 17:22.880
 what's that sound over there? He says we're actually able to contemplate the fact that this

17:22.880 --> 17:30.160
 ride ends. And that kind of cognitive construct is difficult for us to deal with. What the hell

17:30.160 --> 17:38.800
 does that mean? Just to think about it's going to be over at a certain point. It's just over,

17:38.800 --> 17:47.280
 lights out. It's very difficult to load that into whatever this little brain we got. What

17:47.280 --> 17:53.600
 does that actually mean? Maybe that's what gives everything meaning. Because if everything lasted

17:53.600 --> 17:57.840
 forever, if this went on an infinite, there would be no meaning to it. I'd be like, hey,

17:57.840 --> 18:00.960
 if I don't see it tomorrow, I'll see it in a million years. There would be no meaning.

18:00.960 --> 18:06.320
 There would be no urgency. There would be no feelings. There'd be no nothing of magnitude

18:06.320 --> 18:12.160
 or superficiality. It would all just be this kind of, it would be torture. That would actually be

18:12.160 --> 18:17.440
 torture to be here forever. I mean, I'm already sick of this place. And I'm just in my 40s,

18:17.440 --> 18:23.840
 like I'm done. I'm sick of me. I'm sick of everything. A lot of people, when they talk

18:23.840 --> 18:30.640
 about mortality, they consider mortality appealing because you get a chance to do basically

18:32.000 --> 18:37.120
 all these things you might not get a chance to do otherwise, like all the kinds of travel

18:37.120 --> 18:42.160
 broadly, read every book, explore every idea, do every hobby, all those kinds of things.

18:42.800 --> 18:48.880
 Somebody else I was talking to mentioned, the reality of being immortal would be

18:48.880 --> 18:55.600
 be more likely, I like this idea, more likely would be you just sitting there doing nothing

18:56.400 --> 19:02.240
 because and putting off all that travel and exploration till later because you'll always

19:02.240 --> 19:06.960
 have time. And so when you're going to have what actual immortality would look like for a bunch

19:06.960 --> 19:12.000
 of humans is people sitting there doing nothing. It'll be like a Greek cafe, just sitting around

19:12.000 --> 19:18.160
 drinking coffee, watching. I love it. Yeah. It's a lazy man's paradise. Yeah. But it's so interesting

19:18.160 --> 19:24.160
 because that rings true to me for what humans are like is we'll basically just put off all

19:24.160 --> 19:29.040
 those exciting adventures and just be lazy, become lazier and lazier and lazier because you'll always

19:29.040 --> 19:33.600
 have a chance to do all the exciting things and we'll just get, we'll basically become Tim Dill.

19:33.600 --> 19:39.200
 We just sit there and have a podcast and that's it. He works hard. Yeah. I mean, that sounds

19:39.200 --> 19:43.760
 actually like heaven, dude. That's speaking to my heart really. I mean, I'm at heart. I'm a very

19:43.760 --> 19:49.360
 lazy person. I always try to find ways to lie down. Like if I'm sitting, I'll figure out a way to kind

19:49.360 --> 19:55.040
 of contort myself till later. That's an interesting thing to like in. Yeah. If you can always push

19:55.040 --> 20:03.680
 something off. Yeah. I like that. I think that's heaven. And we just changed your mind. You kind

20:03.680 --> 20:08.400
 of like the immortality. Yeah. I kind of like it. No. So there'll be no thirsts. No. You can always

20:08.400 --> 20:14.160
 put it off. I want to have, I want to bang this girl. You're like, I'll put it off. But now I'm

20:14.160 --> 20:18.320
 thinking about Muslim heaven and they may be offering the best deal. I mean, if it was an expo

20:18.320 --> 20:26.080
 and they had a booth, I may go with them because they offer 62 or 72, but then I get sick of them.

20:26.080 --> 20:32.640
 I'd want to, I don't know. I always wondered like, are you given the 62 versions or you choose? Can

20:32.640 --> 20:37.040
 you create them like an avatar, like a video game or are you just given? I don't know what the

20:37.040 --> 20:41.280
 number why it's important to have that high number. First of all, I think it's a mistranslation

20:41.280 --> 20:47.280
 about the versions, but outside of that, outside of that, I feel like the conversation is really

20:47.280 --> 20:52.640
 important. I don't think they ever specify like what kind of books these girls read. Like what are

20:52.640 --> 20:57.840
 they, what are they into? Like the quality of the conversation. I think if you're talking about

20:57.840 --> 21:02.400
 eternity, the quality of the intellect and the conversation and the personalities is way more

21:02.400 --> 21:07.360
 important. And the Greeks have an ancient, ancient expression, which my mother always used to say,

21:07.360 --> 21:12.800
 which is everything in moderation, nothing in excess. So try and always get the status quo.

21:12.800 --> 21:19.360
 And yeah, that many women, eventually it's like the magic Johnson effect. I say a Thomas effect,

21:19.360 --> 21:22.640
 it's just too much. And you're going to end up, you're going to end up banging a dude is what

21:22.640 --> 21:27.680
 I'm saying. You're going to get sick of it because it's too much. And there's going to be a eunuch

21:27.680 --> 21:32.880
 that finds its way into your harem that's been proven throughout history, every empire, when

21:32.880 --> 21:37.360
 you have all that power. And again, this goes back to power corrupting. If you have, if there's no

21:37.360 --> 21:42.560
 struggle, there's no meaning, there's the value is from the journey, the, the working hard to

21:42.560 --> 21:47.120
 struggle. And if it's just given to you because you're a sultan or you're Alexander the Great or

21:47.120 --> 21:51.840
 whatever, you're going to get bored and you're going to bang a dude. That's, it's, I think that's

21:51.840 --> 21:56.480
 a scientific axiom, actually. Eventually you'll get bored and bang a dude. Yeah. But I think it

21:56.480 --> 22:00.320
 won't stop there. I think you'll go to animals, you go to robot. I mean, eventually it all ends

22:00.320 --> 22:05.520
 up in robots and then the robots rebel and then the humus will be destroyed. Yeah. I'm sorry. If

22:06.320 --> 22:13.120
 we're speaking truth, you said the value of life, one of the highest ideals is to seek truth,

22:13.120 --> 22:16.640
 I think if we're being honest. Can I ask you a quick question? If you, if you live in a small,

22:16.640 --> 22:20.160
 I come from small islands, right? And so there's a stereotype that that's where they bang animals.

22:20.160 --> 22:24.240
 But if you come from a very small community, you know, an island or something, and you have

22:24.240 --> 22:28.320
 the choice of banging a family member or an animal, which one is worse on the moral scale?

22:29.280 --> 22:33.280
 Because you're technically not related to the animal. Right. This is interesting. I mean,

22:33.280 --> 22:37.520
 all of these are human constructs, these ideas, but yet for me personally, taboo would be more

22:37.520 --> 22:42.640
 taboo to, to, to have sex with a family member. Yeah. I mean, animal, I mean, okay. It's good

22:42.640 --> 22:46.400
 to know where you stand on that. I think if you were, you know, that if they didn't have,

22:46.400 --> 22:50.000
 they didn't know they had that question. I just, they just learned a little bit about you and now

22:50.000 --> 22:57.600
 I know I look forward to the internet clipping that out. Yeah. I mean, there, there is, listen,

22:58.720 --> 23:04.960
 outside of, outside of that, I do think about that a lot. It sounds ridiculous about morality

23:04.960 --> 23:10.320
 connected to animals in terms of all the, the, the factory farming and so on. It seems like

23:10.320 --> 23:15.280
 that's one of the things we'll look because I love meat, but I kind of feel bad about it.

23:15.280 --> 23:22.560
 And bad in a way where I think if we look like a hundred years from now, we'll look back at this

23:22.560 --> 23:29.600
 time as like one of the great like tortures and injustices that we humans have committed.

23:30.240 --> 23:35.280
 And I mean, all that has to do with the sex with the animal has to do with consent and about the

23:35.280 --> 23:39.520
 experience of suffering of the animals. The reason I think about that personally a lot,

23:39.520 --> 23:48.160
 because I think about robotics, I think about creating artificial consciousnesses, artificial

23:48.800 --> 23:54.080
 like beings that have some elements of the human nature. And then you start to think like, well,

23:54.080 --> 24:00.560
 what does it mean to suffer? What does it mean for entity to exist such that it deserves rights?

24:00.560 --> 24:05.520
 This is something that the founding fathers were thinking about like, you know, all men are created

24:05.520 --> 24:10.880
 equal. What is it? Which, who's included in the men who, who's not in that, in that sentence?

24:11.520 --> 24:16.080
 And our animals included in that are robots. I honestly think that there will be a civil

24:16.080 --> 24:21.680
 rights movement for robots in the future. I don't know. Is that the Turing test? The way you try to,

24:21.680 --> 24:27.520
 is that what they call it? Where you're trying to see if AI can think like a human or whatever or

24:27.520 --> 24:33.440
 feel like a human? Well, it's the Turing test closely defined as more about talk like a human.

24:33.440 --> 24:40.000
 So you can, you can imagine systems that are able to, you can have a conversation like this,

24:40.000 --> 24:46.320
 and I would be a robot, for example. But that doesn't mean I would, in the, in society, that

24:46.320 --> 24:52.080
 doesn't mean I deserve rights or that doesn't mean I would be conscious. It doesn't mean that I would

24:52.080 --> 24:56.880
 be able to suffer and to experience pleasure and dream and all those kinds of human things.

24:57.680 --> 25:01.120
 The question isn't whether you're able to talk, which is passed in the Turing test.

25:01.120 --> 25:07.760
 The question is whether you're able to feel, to be, I mean, to, I go back to suffering.

25:08.560 --> 25:15.600
 The thing that the, that our documents protect us against is suffering. Like we don't want humans

25:15.600 --> 25:24.800
 to suffer. And if a robot can suffer, that discussion starts being about like, well,

25:24.800 --> 25:28.880
 shouldn't we protect them? Currently, we don't protect animals.

25:28.880 --> 25:33.120
 We protect that dog. There's laws. There's actual legislation that protects dogs for

25:33.120 --> 25:37.600
 tortures places. Yeah. And you know, dogs is something I don't think people really

25:37.600 --> 25:44.160
 understand enough about. It's one of my obsessions. So they, they, my dad always used to say those,

25:44.160 --> 25:48.480
 he goes, those things are, those things are basically human. And I mean, they dream,

25:48.480 --> 25:55.040
 they have anxiety. And what people often overlook about dogs is without dogs, we wouldn't be here.

25:55.040 --> 26:01.920
 We would not have ever evolved from hunter gatherer to agrarian to, you know,

26:03.120 --> 26:06.000
 civilization. We wouldn't have cities. We wouldn't have anything. I mean,

26:06.560 --> 26:10.880
 they are our partner in survival and they are a magical animal. There's no,

26:11.520 --> 26:15.520
 there's no animal that was, it was like destiny almost. I mean, a malleable animal.

26:15.520 --> 26:20.160
 There's no animal that's that malleable that in a few generations, you can tailor to

26:20.160 --> 26:25.520
 a specific job that you need. And without that animal, without dogs doing that animal,

26:25.520 --> 26:31.120
 protecting our crops from, from, you know, scavengers and stuff like that, you know,

26:31.120 --> 26:39.120
 the list goes on. We wouldn't be here. So we, that's an often overlooked fact that human evolution

26:39.120 --> 26:44.080
 was not done in a vacuum just with humans. I mean, without dogs, we would have never evolved.

26:44.080 --> 26:47.760
 I mean, we weren't the apex predator for most of our existence. We weren't even the apex predator.

26:47.760 --> 26:51.280
 I mean, we're getting eaten by hyenas, which is my favorite animal. And, you know,

26:51.280 --> 26:55.680
 it's kind of an injustice to, I mean, I'm kind of mad at dogs. We deserve to get eaten by hyenas,

26:55.680 --> 27:00.640
 but without dogs, we wouldn't be here. And dogs, dogs deserve the protection.

27:00.640 --> 27:05.040
 So do horses. They fucking lugged us around for thousands of years. And now these fucking

27:05.040 --> 27:10.000
 German psychopaths are eating them or whatever. We should not eat horse meat just on like,

27:10.640 --> 27:14.400
 be a good dude, man. These things lugged us around for generations. They're beautiful,

27:14.400 --> 27:19.440
 you know, ride them. Or I don't know. I don't know, but it rubs me the wrong way that we eat horses.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.800
 Yeah, the horse is one is interesting. And one of my favorite books is Animal Farm by Orwell.

27:24.800 --> 27:31.440
 And the horses don't get a good ending in that. I kind of, my spirit animal, I suppose,

27:31.440 --> 27:36.960
 is the horse from Animal Farm Boxer, where he says, I will work harder. That's his motto.

27:37.520 --> 27:43.440
 I work really hard at stupid things. That's basically what I did. I just hit my head against

27:43.440 --> 27:46.800
 the wall for no reason whatsoever. But that probably fulfills, you have a big brain,

27:46.800 --> 27:50.080
 you were probably born with a big brain that kind of fulfills. It's killing neurons.

27:50.080 --> 27:54.960
 It's exercise for you. Yes. Yes. Don't you think some animals deserve to be eaten though? Kind of

27:54.960 --> 28:02.240
 like hyenas? Come on, dude. I mean, you got to respect hyena. Okay, so let me just comment on

28:02.240 --> 28:08.160
 the dog thing. There is like conferences on dog cognition from a perspective of people that study

28:08.160 --> 28:13.360
 psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, dogs are fascinating. The way they move their eyes

28:13.360 --> 28:18.000
 is they're able to, they're the only other animal besides humans, they're able to communicate with

28:18.000 --> 28:23.280
 their eyes. They can look at a thing and look back at you and look back at the thing to communicate

28:23.280 --> 28:28.640
 that we're all like, through our eyes, communicate that we're collaborating. So every other animal

28:28.640 --> 28:35.200
 uses their eyes to actually look at things. The dogs use it to like communicate with us humans.

28:35.200 --> 28:39.200
 It's fascinating. There's a lot of other elements of dogs that are amazing. Yeah. I mean, if it

28:39.200 --> 28:43.760
 wasn't for them, they are the ones, they were our first alarm system for predators. They would

28:43.760 --> 28:47.440
 defend us. I mean, the besenji is one of the most ancient dogs. I mean, they're tiny, but they're

28:47.440 --> 28:50.960
 fearless. Yeah. And they would chase off lions. Like, you know, there'd be packs of them and they'd

28:50.960 --> 28:56.400
 chase off lions and protect the tribes. It's, it's, it's, I even get tingles like thinking about

28:56.400 --> 29:00.000
 dogs because I have a dog, I love my dog. It's just, and there's something about when you're

29:00.000 --> 29:04.400
 walking with your dog off leash in the woods, it's like, there's something about it that's like,

29:04.400 --> 29:10.320
 that, that tugs at that millions of years of evolution, like that gut, you know, it's like,

29:10.880 --> 29:16.080
 I had a Finnish friend of mine, he's a comic Tommy Volamy's once told me, he was like, he was like,

29:16.080 --> 29:20.080
 the gut, he's like, I believe in that, like that gut, you know, when you have that feeling,

29:20.080 --> 29:26.080
 he's like, always trust that because that is million, those are all your ancestors. That's

29:26.080 --> 29:31.120
 the survival instinct of all your ancestors and beginning of time, you know, telling you like,

29:31.120 --> 29:34.560
 hey, something's off here, something's, you know, so don't get in the car with Ted Bundy is what

29:34.560 --> 29:38.640
 I'm saying, ladies, how fucking stupid, who, how could you fall for that? You know, he's got a

29:38.640 --> 29:44.000
 fucking sling on, don't get in. Yeah, follow the gut. My question to you, are psychopaths

29:44.720 --> 29:50.000
 essentially robots? So first of all, let's not, you're using the word robot in a derogatory way

29:50.000 --> 29:56.400
 that I, I'm triggered by. Okay. So I feel offended. You should be because you know what, people are

29:56.400 --> 30:04.240
 always scared of robots, but I actually, I have, I've made the sort of, I've made it to say, hey,

30:04.240 --> 30:08.640
 I've thought about it, like robots have been nothing but helpful. It's the people we should

30:08.640 --> 30:13.360
 be scared of. Right. Again, we're kind of missing the most destructive thing as us because it's,

30:13.360 --> 30:18.160
 but robots are helpful. I mean, this is a fucking robot, you know, I went on hotel tonight,

30:18.160 --> 30:22.000
 I'm already booked up, you know, I got my, I can change my flight if this barbecue with

30:22.000 --> 30:25.760
 Rogan goes 16 hours, which whatever Rogan wants to do, I'll do if he wants to kick me in the

30:25.760 --> 30:30.560
 chest, I'll let him kick me in a chest, whatever. Robots are helpful, no?

30:31.360 --> 30:35.440
 Yeah. Tanks and autonomous weapons systems don't kill people, people kill people.

30:36.320 --> 30:39.760
 Yeah, that's. Yeah, the other way is about to click that for you.

30:43.200 --> 30:47.520
 A lot of love for dogs. I appreciate it very much. And at the same time, you have the other thing

30:47.520 --> 30:52.640
 that people seem to have love for, which is cats. And on the flip side of everything you've said,

30:52.640 --> 30:57.840
 I'm trying to understand what have cats ever done for human civilization?

30:57.840 --> 31:02.160
 They keep rodents away. The domesticated cat is very important, keeps rodents away. Yeah,

31:02.160 --> 31:06.640
 that's what they were domesticated for. I mean, they're psychopathic killers who end up killing

31:07.600 --> 31:17.840
 innocent neighborhood chipmunks and birds. They really affect the balance of the local ecosystem,

31:17.840 --> 31:24.160
 but not as much as dogs. I mean, dogs are, like you said, they look at humans. I actually read

31:24.160 --> 31:28.080
 an article there, some people were theorizing they're smarter than chimps because of the way

31:28.080 --> 31:32.800
 they can work with humans. And there was one border collie that spoke like 300 words, like a

31:32.800 --> 31:38.160
 quarter, almost part of the language. And their nose is like a, I mean, that's like magic, dude.

31:38.160 --> 31:42.320
 If you can smell in my ass to what I had for breakfast from miles away.

31:42.320 --> 31:46.640
 That's intelligence. That's intelligence. I mean, in some ways that their nose,

31:46.640 --> 31:50.960
 if you were to put it on a scale, maybe their nose is more intelligent than our brain for what it

31:50.960 --> 31:55.760
 does. It's like, I mean, dude, they can smell you from miles away. You ever see a dog just like

31:55.760 --> 32:01.440
 sniffing, catching? I mean, it's smelling like, I don't remember the date on it, but it's like,

32:01.440 --> 32:06.640
 they have like millions of receptors or something where we only, thank God we don't have their

32:06.640 --> 32:12.000
 nose. That would make sex weird. Be a little too intense.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.640
 I think you mentioned when you were talking about Woody Allen separating the

32:17.760 --> 32:21.040
 art from the artist. So that brings to mind, Vladimir Putin.

32:24.480 --> 32:32.640
 How about that transition? I don't know. I'm so sorry. But if you look at just powerful leaders

32:32.640 --> 32:38.720
 throughout history, Stalin, Hitler, but even model ones like Putin, and we're talking about power,

32:38.720 --> 32:48.960
 how do you explain them? You said that power reveals not corrupt. But do you think there's

32:48.960 --> 32:55.120
 some element to which power corrupted Hitler, power corrupted Stalin after he gained power?

32:55.120 --> 33:00.800
 And the same with Putin. When Putin gained power in 2000, do you think the amount of power that

33:00.800 --> 33:04.880
 he was in possession with for many years, do you think that corrupted him? I mean,

33:04.880 --> 33:11.200
 we're joking about dictators get the job done. There is some sense in certain countries where

33:11.200 --> 33:21.920
 dictator is the only thing that can stabilize a nation. The Conor argument to that for democracies

33:21.920 --> 33:27.200
 is like, yeah, but that's a short term solution for a long term problem. So you want to embrace

33:27.200 --> 33:34.480
 chaos with democracy that might be violent. There might be a lot of just constant changing

33:34.480 --> 33:39.680
 of leadership. There might be a lot of corruption in the short term. But if you stay strong with

33:41.920 --> 33:47.840
 the ideals of democracy, then you'll be ultimately create something that as beautiful and stable as

33:47.840 --> 33:55.920
 the United States. The sad thing is, is I don't know if that if history tells that story. It's

33:55.920 --> 34:01.200
 like I said, you look at Greece, you look at Rome, democracy kind of failed. The majority of Rome,

34:01.200 --> 34:08.640
 the most successful empire that we've had was a dictatorship for most of its run.

34:10.560 --> 34:15.040
 But I do believe in a republic, which is sort of a limited democracy. I do believe

34:15.600 --> 34:21.280
 in what we have here. I believe in common law, I believe in individual rights.

34:23.440 --> 34:29.600
 But yeah, I think you said it. Nobody could have said it better. Yeah, it's a short term solution.

34:29.600 --> 34:36.480
 You look at Saddam Hussein, when we took him out, then there was a lot of infighting that

34:36.480 --> 34:43.120
 happened that he was kind of keeping at bay because he was a strongman, dictator.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.920
 Well, he's an interesting one. Sorry to interrupt. No.

34:45.920 --> 34:50.800
 From my understanding, I'm sure people will correct me, but when Saddam Hussein first came to power,

34:50.800 --> 35:00.480
 he was, he's quite progressive. So as far as I understand, the signs of an evil

35:00.480 --> 35:05.680
 dictator weren't exactly there. So again, there's, I don't know if power revealed,

35:05.680 --> 35:10.160
 the power corrupted. Or that could have been the initial subterfuge to kind of get everybody.

35:10.960 --> 35:15.680
 Hitler also is a champion of the people. It's built some new roads. It's what psychopaths do.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.680
 And that's why it's interesting to me. I'm not sure if power corrupts psychopaths.

35:19.680 --> 35:22.720
 And now that we know that we can do these CAT scans and brain scans, again,

35:22.720 --> 35:28.400
 we know that they're born that way. Power definitely corrupts people who have

35:28.960 --> 35:36.400
 the capacity to feel and for empathy. Power, I'm not sure. I don't think power corrupts people

35:36.400 --> 35:43.280
 who were born psychopathic with that condition or sociopaths who had, who, you know, who were

35:43.280 --> 35:48.640
 closer to psychopath and then had some traumatic life. You know, I just think, you know, the best

35:48.640 --> 35:53.840
 way to get away with whatever nefarious thing you want to do to feel, I guess the only thing

35:53.840 --> 35:58.160
 psychopaths can feel is that excitement is to pretend to be the opposite of what you are.

35:58.720 --> 36:02.640
 That's what, that's what killers do. That's what the worst people to look at Bill Cosby.

36:02.640 --> 36:08.800
 I mean, he was, what better way to hide, you know, it's like what wokeness is now. It's like,

36:08.800 --> 36:14.160
 I'm such a great person. And then you're like, are you, it's a great, the best way to hide

36:14.160 --> 36:18.080
 is to pretend to be the opposite of what you are. Just like Ted Bundy. I'm just an innocent,

36:18.080 --> 36:21.280
 helpful guy. And then boom, next thing you know, you're getting your tip bit off.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.800
 It's really well said. It's actually kind of funny because I talk about love a lot.

36:25.600 --> 36:30.720
 And I think the people that kind of look at me with squinty eyes, they wonder,

36:31.680 --> 36:35.680
 like, how many bodies are in that closet? You know what I mean? Like,

36:35.680 --> 36:40.960
 there's something about the duality of like, we're so skeptical as a culture. Like, if somebody's

36:40.960 --> 36:48.560
 just like, seems to be kind of sort of, I don't know, positive and all that kind of,

36:49.840 --> 36:55.120
 how do I put it? Just simple, simple minded in the positivity they express,

36:55.120 --> 36:59.280
 they think like there's some demons in there. Yeah, especially if you're in New York or we

36:59.280 --> 37:03.120
 don't trust any, the nicer you are, the more skeptical we are. I've struggled with that down

37:03.120 --> 37:06.320
 here. I've been like, what's your angle? And they're like, no, dude, just I wanted to show

37:06.320 --> 37:10.400
 you the best tacos, man. And I'm like, did you really, what do you want? Because in New York,

37:10.400 --> 37:16.400
 it's like, if anyone's nice to you, they want something. And that's, the pro side to that is

37:16.400 --> 37:20.320
 it makes you very street smart. The downside to that is it makes you way too cynical.

37:20.880 --> 37:25.920
 Yeah, I definitely experienced that here in Texas, but people are super, super nice. And

37:25.920 --> 37:32.880
 they're like, do all this cool shit for you. And you wonder, what's the angle? What are we doing

37:32.880 --> 37:38.560
 here? You mentioned hyenas as your favorite animal. I forgot to ask you, what the hell

37:38.560 --> 37:45.600
 were you thinking? Why is hyena is your favorite animal? Yeah, it's fascinating animal. Let's look

37:45.600 --> 37:51.360
 at the whole animal kingdom. Like why is it, where do you put, so you like dogs. Love my favorite.

37:51.360 --> 37:55.360
 Your favorite is dogs, but they're kind of outside the animal kingdom because you're thinking about

37:55.360 --> 38:02.080
 wolves. So the animal kingdom is in nature. Dogs escaped nature. They kind of did, yeah.

38:02.720 --> 38:07.840
 Together with humans, like in a collaborative way, exactly. So within nature, within the animal

38:07.840 --> 38:15.040
 kingdom, who's, why not lions? Because lions are predictable. Lions are just, you know,

38:15.040 --> 38:20.880
 they're regal and kind of they bore me. It's like the hot chick. It's like, we get it. You were born

38:20.880 --> 38:27.840
 the best. Yeah. You know, I like a scrappy, by any means necessary, intelligent and cunning.

38:28.960 --> 38:35.280
 But aren't they dishonest? Yeah. And that's why I like them. Yes, they're dishonest. They

38:35.280 --> 38:42.480
 employ chicanery. And that's just a sign of how intelligent they are and how self reliant they

38:42.480 --> 38:49.200
 are and how brutal they are. They're brutally honest in how much they lie, you know, because

38:49.840 --> 38:55.200
 they're trying to get the job done. You know, lions are just like, they're too gifted.

38:55.200 --> 38:59.200
 Everyone hates the fucking, you know, if I went to school with you, of course,

38:59.200 --> 39:03.680
 Lex knows the fucking answer. Lex was born smarter than me, you know, and you'd probably hate me

39:03.680 --> 39:08.720
 because I was the kid always seeking attention and making people. It's like, that's not interesting.

39:08.720 --> 39:14.000
 The guy that claws his way to the top, and those are hyenas, they're also fascinating just by

39:14.640 --> 39:20.400
 merely who they are. I mean, they're not related to any other animal. They're more closely related

39:20.400 --> 39:26.000
 to cats than they are dogs, even though they look like a dog. Yeah. But they're very, like very

39:26.000 --> 39:31.200
 tangentially related even to cats. So they're their own kind of thing, which is kind of mysterious.

39:31.200 --> 39:36.720
 I don't think they fully figured out. And they, the pseudopenist thing is the, I mean,

39:36.720 --> 39:41.520
 this is the talk. Can you explain the pseudopenist side? Yeah. So the, it's a matriarchal society,

39:41.520 --> 39:46.080
 by the way. So that's the unique in and of itself that this, we're talking about an apex predator

39:46.080 --> 39:51.520
 that is matriarchal, much like, you know, the praying mantis. It's very rare, though, and they

39:51.520 --> 39:56.400
 are fucking brutal and vicious. And the women are bigger and they let their cubs fight a lot

39:56.400 --> 40:00.320
 of fratricide and they do that because they're like, Hey, you're weaker. They let your brother

40:00.320 --> 40:06.080
 kill you. And the women have penises. The women have pseudopenises that they give birth out of.

40:06.080 --> 40:11.120
 And the birth is violent, but they, they roll around with just huge pieces. They're glue guns

40:11.120 --> 40:17.440
 are just fucking swinging, you know, and the women are just run the show. And it's just cool

40:17.440 --> 40:24.240
 that they have these pseudopenises. It's almost romantic to eat this guy. They have the strongest

40:24.240 --> 40:29.200
 bite force. They, they pulverize bone, like when they eat an animal, the animal's gone.

40:29.200 --> 40:35.200
 There's no bones. They eat everything. They can pulverize. Their bite is so powerful. They pulverize

40:35.200 --> 40:40.160
 bone and eat it. So if they consume an animal, it, the animal was there and then the animal's gone.

40:40.160 --> 40:44.560
 There's no, nothing for the vultures there to, to, to, to grab.

40:44.560 --> 40:50.080
 Yeah, I'm going to have to revisit the hyenas because my experience with the hyenas was from,

40:50.080 --> 40:59.520
 first of all, his, your hyenas, your show has rebranded them for me, but the Lion King, which is a,

41:00.240 --> 41:05.840
 a cartoon, I guess, that I get emotional at every time I, I don't, I hope, I probably have father

41:05.840 --> 41:10.400
 issues every, every guy. You probably just, you just have feelings. You're a good guy. I mean,

41:10.400 --> 41:14.800
 everyone has that. Yeah, you have feelings. That one gets everybody. I don't know. I get, I get every

41:14.800 --> 41:22.640
 father son movie, like Blow with Johnny Depp and Ray Leota. Damn, that's a good movie. And whenever

41:22.640 --> 41:28.000
 there's like a, like the disappointment in the father that his son has become like

41:29.280 --> 41:35.520
 this incredibly successful drug lord that then ends up with nothing in prison,

41:36.640 --> 41:40.000
 just the sadness of them committing through letters. Man, that gets me every time.

41:40.000 --> 41:46.400
 But, but, you know, the hyenas are not presented that well in that.

41:46.960 --> 41:52.720
 No, they're usually portrayed as like, it's really sad that they're portrayed that way in

41:52.720 --> 41:59.680
 lions, like lions aren't dicks. Lions are dicks. They, the, the, the, the alpha lions will kill

41:59.680 --> 42:05.680
 the cubs of another rival. They do all types of dick shit. And yeah, the hyenas are more

42:05.680 --> 42:10.240
 interesting. Like they'll just roll in like a hyena will like, like you said the lie, you know, because

42:10.240 --> 42:14.480
 when you watch the Serengeti, you know, animals will hang out with each other. They're like by

42:14.480 --> 42:20.400
 water. So one hyena will just kind of roll in and pretend like it's not hungry. And then bang,

42:20.400 --> 42:26.160
 they'll use any means necessary to take an animal down. Like lions will just use brute strength.

42:26.160 --> 42:31.440
 Hyenas use cunning and you can even go on the internet and find memes of this where hyenas

42:31.440 --> 42:36.800
 will grab the big animal by the balls and just like, we'll sneak up behind it and bite its balls

42:36.800 --> 42:42.880
 and you'll watch an animal 10 size, 10 times the size of the hyena just slowly go down. It's brutal,

42:42.880 --> 42:50.080
 but it's fucking hilarious. So I, I think that's, uh, I don't know if you, uh, follow the, the,

42:50.080 --> 42:57.920
 the channel, um, nature's metal. That's, that one weighs heavy on me and the hyenas on the balls.

42:57.920 --> 43:07.040
 I, it's tough to, to intellectualize it. It's tough to think that the entirety of life on

43:07.040 --> 43:15.840
 earth has this history of, um, predators being violent, just like just the murder that we come

43:15.840 --> 43:23.440
 from. It's crazy. It, uh, just like, we're talking about meditating on death. I actually, I keep

43:23.440 --> 43:28.160
 following and unfollowing that Instagram channel because like sometimes it's too much. Like, I

43:28.160 --> 43:33.840
 can't, I can't continue with the day after like seeing the brutality, the honest brutality of that.

43:34.720 --> 43:37.680
 I don't know how to make sense of it. It's important to acknowledge, I think,

43:37.680 --> 43:43.280
 because that it's real and we do come from that. We are, we evolve from that. It's important. We

43:43.280 --> 43:46.560
 still do that. We're just hidden from it. You know, when you go to the supermarket and get

43:46.560 --> 43:51.600
 your slab of meat and you know, you're so disconnected from where that meat came from,

43:51.600 --> 43:57.280
 it came from that. And often that's uglier to watch than because there's some honesty.

43:57.280 --> 44:02.400
 You know, the, the, the, the nature channels only show, uh, that's why we have so much sympathy

44:02.400 --> 44:05.840
 with the prey. And this is where I think the same thing with mafia movies. They don't show

44:05.840 --> 44:09.280
 what the mafia really does. They glorify the good parts. That's why I like state of grace,

44:09.280 --> 44:13.680
 because it's really just shaking down old people and fucking being dicks. It's not driving nice

44:13.680 --> 44:17.600
 cars and being like, you know, so, and animal channels do the same thing. They only show when

44:17.600 --> 44:23.200
 the cheetah gets it because that's, that's the exciting part. But what most people don't know

44:23.200 --> 44:29.120
 is that those predators strike out almost always. A majority of the time, the prey wins.

44:29.760 --> 44:35.520
 And so if you saw that and put in context, you might not hate it as much when the predator

44:35.520 --> 44:40.640
 actually gets the little fawn or whatever, because it's so many fawns got away. It's so hard

44:40.640 --> 44:44.000
 to capture your prey. And you know, we, we don't have the, the, the, they,

44:44.000 --> 44:51.360
 they, no, no documentary is going to sit around and show you the 99 times the cheetah didn't catch.

44:51.360 --> 44:54.480
 Thank you for this perspective. That's murder is difficult. So like,

44:54.480 --> 45:01.760
 this is the, they never talk about for people who murder how difficult it is, like, to trap

45:01.760 --> 45:05.440
 somebody, to convince them to come back to your place. Give it some respect. Put some respect

45:05.440 --> 45:08.800
 on Ted Bundy's name. Yeah. It's not easy to convince somebody to get in your Volkswagen

45:08.800 --> 45:14.080
 Beagle and clean up. And then you have to kind of plan ahead because you want to keep doing the

45:14.080 --> 45:18.240
 murder, mass murder. You got to learn how to saw them up, put them in duffel bags, bury,

45:18.240 --> 45:21.360
 you got to learn how to dig, you got to learn how to hide, you got to learn to lie. I mean,

45:21.360 --> 45:25.680
 it's a lot that goes into it that we need to pull the respect on. Yeah.

45:25.680 --> 45:29.760
 Yeah. And you have to figure out which tools work the best for the song and all those kinds of things.

45:31.520 --> 45:35.040
 So thank you for the perspective. That's what, that's what I was hoping

45:35.040 --> 45:42.000
 we would bring to this table before. Yeah. So you, you got a little bit Greek in you.

45:43.360 --> 45:49.120
 One of the episodes on, on history hyenas, you talked about the Battle of Crete,

45:50.480 --> 45:59.200
 where the Greeks, your people in, in 1941, in the early stages of the World War II,

45:59.200 --> 46:06.800
 there's one of the most epic battles of the war. In fact, in 1941, in a speech made at the Reichstag,

46:06.800 --> 46:13.520
 Hitler paid tribute to the bravery of the Greeks saying, it must be said for the sake of historical

46:13.520 --> 46:20.160
 truth that amongst all our opponents, only the Greeks fought with the endless courage and

46:20.160 --> 46:25.440
 defiance of death. So, okay, what do you make of this battle? What do you make of the spirit of

46:25.440 --> 46:30.960
 the Greek people? This is one of the closest things to me because my mother was actually

46:32.000 --> 46:36.640
 on the island of Crete during this, the first aerial invasion in history. A lot of people

46:36.640 --> 46:41.440
 don't know that. So this is a very significant battle. The first time there was an invasion from

46:41.440 --> 46:48.160
 the sky. And my mother was a little girl and she lived through four years of Nazi occupation there.

46:48.160 --> 46:51.600
 So my mother was a human rights lawyer and everything, but she just always hated Germans.

46:51.600 --> 46:56.400
 It's just what it is. She hated Germans and she never got over it. So the most progressive,

46:56.400 --> 47:02.720
 open minded woman just could not get over this. It's a monumental battle that a lot of historians

47:02.720 --> 47:08.160
 in retrospect have now looked back on and said because the Nazis, first off, you got to take

47:08.160 --> 47:12.160
 it back to when Hitler instructed Mussolini, because let's be honest, Mussolini was Hitler's

47:12.160 --> 47:17.440
 bitch. You know what I mean? It was like, if it was Fantasy Island, Hitler was the fucking,

47:17.440 --> 47:22.480
 and Mussolini was boss of the plane. Mussolini ever say no to Hitler? Or even maybe? It's always

47:22.480 --> 47:31.360
 like, yes. Yes, we would do it. And it's like, yeah, you have to take Greece. And so, yeah.

47:32.160 --> 47:38.560
 So Italy being much bigger than Greece. Greece is a tiny country, 9, 10 million. So Italy invaded

47:38.560 --> 47:48.240
 Greece, you know, and Aukidei's a big holiday for Greeks. And this speaks to the spirit. Greeks

47:48.240 --> 47:54.720
 in fight until we have a common enemy, and then we unite. You see it throughout history, Sparta

47:54.720 --> 47:59.840
 and Athens. You see it in Greek families, where the brothers will fight. But then as soon as we

47:59.840 --> 48:05.520
 have a common enemy, we unite. And maybe it's an overactive brain. We think too much, our traditions

48:05.520 --> 48:09.200
 philosophy, and we overthink things, and we fight with each other and take things personally. We're

48:09.200 --> 48:15.440
 ultra passionate. But when Italy said, hey, we're going to move troops through, you know,

48:16.400 --> 48:23.120
 a Greek said, Aukie, which means no. And that was, and then Italy attacked. And we beat the

48:23.120 --> 48:28.880
 shit out of them. A much bigger country, much more well equipped country, Greece beat the

48:28.880 --> 48:33.120
 shit out of them, kicked them back into Albania. Actually, not only repelled them,

48:33.120 --> 48:37.360
 actually, like conquered some ground in Albania, pushed them back. And then Hitler was like,

48:37.360 --> 48:43.040
 fuck, you know, I was planning my march to Russia. But I have to go down because he basically said

48:43.040 --> 48:47.680
 to Mussolini, like, you know, you basically bitch lapped, like, I got to do this myself,

48:47.680 --> 48:51.840
 because you such a fucking bitch. So then the Nazis invaded Greece. Obviously, they took the

48:51.840 --> 48:56.240
 mainland with fight and shot out. The Greeks never give credit to the British and New Zealand

48:56.240 --> 49:00.640
 and Australian troops that were there. You know, they were a large part of this, the majority of

49:00.640 --> 49:06.800
 it. But the Greeks fight to civilians. I mean, they fought, you know, the Ottomans were there

49:06.800 --> 49:12.400
 400 years, you go to Greece now, there's no evidence, there's virtually no evidence of them

49:12.400 --> 49:17.120
 ever being there. That's the Greek spirit, kick them out. And we kicked out hummus too.

49:17.120 --> 49:21.840
 So it's like, their culture is gone, you're gone. Because Greeks are, it's Philoptimo,

49:21.840 --> 49:26.720
 it's called Philoptimo. And it's a real thing. Philoptimo is a very little trans, you can't

49:26.720 --> 49:33.440
 translate it, but it's kind of like honor, loyalty, friendship, altruism, it's a, it's,

49:33.440 --> 49:37.840
 you can't define it, but Greeks know it and we're taught it from our, from our families.

49:38.480 --> 49:43.360
 It's a vibe and it's a Greek cultural thing. And we're an old culture and Philoptimo is what

49:43.360 --> 49:50.480
 it's called. Philoptimo and it's, it's love, it's passion. And it comes out and it comes out. And

49:50.480 --> 49:58.160
 so, so Hitler had to postpone his invasion of, of Russia, went down the island of Crete,

49:59.040 --> 50:05.600
 took 10 days to conquer. It's an island to put that in perspective. The country of France

50:06.160 --> 50:09.520
 fell in three or four days. I can't even remember because they fucking just rolled over. So what

50:09.520 --> 50:13.200
 is it? What, what is a couple of hours matter when you're that much of a fucking pussy?

50:13.200 --> 50:16.400
 Yeah. Okay. What is a couple of 12 hour fucking three or four days?

50:16.400 --> 50:23.200
 Uh, the island of Crete took the Germans 10 days to conquer. And because of that,

50:23.200 --> 50:29.520
 and because of the Greek resistance, Hitler had to postpone his invasion of Russia to winner.

50:29.520 --> 50:34.560
 And of course that was, you know, that was his downfall just as it was Napoleon's. And

50:34.560 --> 50:38.800
 never dude, never try to invade Russia. They got millions of people to throw at death.

50:38.800 --> 50:42.640
 Every time you read about Russians in history books, like, and a million died. I mean, it's

50:42.640 --> 50:47.040
 that you just guys throw millions of people at the problem. And don't fuck with that Russian winner.

50:47.040 --> 50:51.520
 And don't fuck with Russian people, dude. They're tough. People in New York know that you don't go

50:51.520 --> 50:55.520
 to fucking sheep's head bands are talking shit. You'll end up in a fucking car trunk and they'll

50:55.520 --> 51:01.280
 brutally murder you. I do not fuck with Russians. Amen. And then there's, I mean, there's a lot of

51:01.280 --> 51:06.400
 people, a lot of historians argue that that battle was because of the Russian winter, because of

51:06.400 --> 51:10.560
 delaying the Russian invasion, but also psychologically delaying the invasion. It was the

51:10.560 --> 51:17.680
 first time, I think it was the first time the Germans failed not or didn't succeed like they

51:17.680 --> 51:24.800
 wanted to early in the war, which is a little like psychologically the impact of that I think is

51:24.800 --> 51:31.920
 immeasurable. And also a lot of people argue from a military strategy perspective that the

51:32.640 --> 51:39.760
 just like you said, it was an aerial attack and that Hitler didn't think that that kind of attack

51:39.760 --> 51:45.120
 would then be useful for the rest of the war. So that's that's a really part where whereas it might

51:45.120 --> 51:50.640
 have been very useful. So it's a it's really interesting how these little battles can steer

51:50.640 --> 51:56.080
 the directions of war. Of course, me growing up in the Soviet Union, we didn't hear much about this

51:56.080 --> 52:01.840
 battle. Just like you said, millions of Soviets died. All those people in history that you read

52:01.840 --> 52:06.240
 about dying, those are all civilians, but I mean, not all, but a very large number of them are

52:06.240 --> 52:12.560
 civilians. And their stories, obviously, that's the rooted, the literature, the poetry, the music,

52:13.360 --> 52:18.720
 just the way people talk, the way they drink vodka, the way they love, the way they hate,

52:18.720 --> 52:26.320
 the way they fear, that's all like rooted in World War Two and World War One. And so but we never

52:26.320 --> 52:32.880
 kind of think about Europe. And we certainly growing up didn't think about their role in the

52:32.880 --> 52:38.960
 United States. All this, there's plenty of stories of heroism in in the Soviet Union, enough enough

52:38.960 --> 52:45.120
 for many lifetimes. So but it was fascinating to reach from a Greek perspective. Because I, you

52:45.120 --> 52:52.560
 know, I don't have many Greek friends, hoping to change that. This is the beginning of a love affair

52:53.120 --> 52:59.360
 of your people. Likewise, the Americans don't hear about the Soviet contribution to the end of

52:59.360 --> 53:04.560
 World War Two, because obviously we became, you know, enemies after that, because of the two systems.

53:04.560 --> 53:08.480
 But yeah, without the Russians, with World War Two, wouldn't have been one either.

53:08.480 --> 53:13.600
 Yeah, the stories are written by the victors. That's really interesting. I just looking at history,

53:14.240 --> 53:19.360
 you wonder what's missing. I'll tell you what's missing that I know for a fact. Because my dad

53:19.360 --> 53:23.520
 told, my dad told me combats hell, and he would tell me the reality of what it's really like

53:23.520 --> 53:27.760
 guys pissing themselves, calling for their mother, the fog of war, obviously. Fracture

53:27.760 --> 53:31.760
 side happens all the time. It's pandemonium. I mean, there's skill involved. But I mean,

53:31.760 --> 53:36.080
 there's no like, it's a lot of it is just luck. My dad said he my dad won three.

53:36.080 --> 53:40.560
 He got, you know, metals, purple hearts, all that shit. And he said the reason was

53:40.560 --> 53:43.760
 is because he can't he always said this is another thing he told me you can't pin a metal on a dead

53:43.760 --> 53:49.040
 guy. So it's like, those are the guys who deserve it. But you can't pin a metal, you can't do the

53:49.040 --> 53:55.520
 pomp and sit with. And I'll tell you one thing is that it is written by the victors. And all

53:55.520 --> 53:59.920
 these leaders, they say we're in the front, we're not in the front. We're not. Whenever the history

53:59.920 --> 54:05.840
 books say he led his troops into battle, it's like, did he really? Did he? So then how did he live?

54:05.840 --> 54:09.600
 Because they put like kids in the front, you know, it's like, nobody limps back from the front

54:09.600 --> 54:16.080
 with like a injury, you know, that's, that's army PR. You know, whenever you read, you know,

54:16.720 --> 54:23.120
 27 soldiers died, 14 were injured. The word injured is PR. That's like injured. Was he,

54:23.120 --> 54:29.120
 did he sprain his ankle? Did he need, did he get carried off the court or, you know, he was maimed?

54:29.120 --> 54:34.320
 I mean, he was like, his leg was blown off, you know, it's like, so I think that, you know,

54:34.320 --> 54:38.080
 Alexander the Great was just kind of in the back on his horse and just kind of, he had his eunuch

54:38.080 --> 54:42.160
 blown a few times and he was like, is it bad up there? And then like after that, he was like,

54:42.160 --> 54:46.240
 okay, my scribe, give me my scribe. Okay, when you write this down, can you put me in the front?

54:46.240 --> 54:50.640
 Yeah. And I was just, make me a big hero. And I was in there. And then he, you know, he just

54:50.640 --> 54:53.840
 blew his, you know, he had sex with his eunuch and rode off into the sunset,

54:53.840 --> 54:57.520
 because there's just no way you survive in the front, especially warfare back then. I mean,

54:57.520 --> 55:05.200
 it's like brutal. Then again, you have like, Jengus Khan, the sense I got that he was a little bit

55:05.200 --> 55:09.600
 up on the front, at least at first. Yeah. Or is that also, is he a little bit outside?

55:09.600 --> 55:12.880
 Give me my scribe. Yeah, it's all lore. I mean, you ever play the game of telephone?

55:13.680 --> 55:17.760
 You know, it's like, you know, there's no video cameras back then. So shit just get,

55:17.760 --> 55:22.560
 turns into myth, you know? And there's no way he was in the front. There's no way he wouldn't have

55:22.560 --> 55:28.320
 lived. You know, he was probably good on horseback because those, those dudes were good on horseback.

55:28.320 --> 55:32.000
 But it was like Game of Thrones back then, you had all these different people and they kind of,

55:32.000 --> 55:37.280
 yeah, the, the, the Mongols were wild, dude. They are actually said like, they started like,

55:37.280 --> 55:41.680
 they were more adaptable to the horse because they were so good on horseback that kids started

55:41.680 --> 55:46.000
 to be born like kind of bow legged, like to fit the horse. It's wild. And they would stretch their

55:46.000 --> 55:50.560
 heads and shit like that. They'd wrap them and stretch their heads. So they find like Mongol

55:50.560 --> 55:57.040
 skulls and they look like cone heads and they were brutal and vicious. And they would maraud and

55:57.040 --> 56:02.000
 rape and all the fun stuff that, you know, when, you know, when you visit other places back then,

56:02.000 --> 56:06.640
 there's no Chachiki stops and souvenir shops. What you do is you take women and those are the

56:06.640 --> 56:11.200
 tokens, you know, you burn a few huts different. Tourism was different back then.

56:11.200 --> 56:18.400
 Yeah. That's another difficult thing. Just we're talking about nature and predators to think about

56:19.760 --> 56:25.840
 the long stretch of history where we're just murder. Yeah. And we made so much progress,

56:25.840 --> 56:31.120
 I guess, in the past couple of centuries. The United States is a shiny example of that.

56:31.120 --> 56:33.520
 But do you think also that it's that effect that we were,

56:34.640 --> 56:39.040
 a lot of good things had to happen too? Or else we wouldn't be here. So do we just focus?

56:39.040 --> 56:43.680
 Isn't it like a car crash effect that like we're, you know, the rubber neck of everyone pulls over

56:43.680 --> 56:47.040
 to see a car crash? Are we just only focusing on the negative things of history because they're

56:47.040 --> 56:50.880
 just more exciting to us? Like it's just not boring to be like, yeah, and then there was a bunch of

56:50.880 --> 56:57.680
 villagers and they ate every day and danced and loved. Yeah. I wonder, I wonder how different

56:57.680 --> 57:04.240
 those people were, you know, like they might have had the same exact loves and fears and

57:04.240 --> 57:11.760
 like they perhaps had the same kind of brilliant ideas in their head, if not more brilliant.

57:11.760 --> 57:15.520
 And we kind of think about like this moment in history is like the most special moment.

57:16.080 --> 57:20.400
 Like we're doing the coolest shit that we're doing the most amazing building and most amazing

57:20.400 --> 57:24.560
 things. But maybe they were building amazing things in their different way with like less

57:24.560 --> 57:30.000
 technological, but in the space of ideas, in the space of just all the different, the camaraderie,

57:30.000 --> 57:35.840
 in the space of like concepts, mathematics, all those kinds of things. Yeah. I mean,

57:35.840 --> 57:38.720
 Greece, you look at the architecture, it still stands up. I mean, all the government play,

57:38.720 --> 57:44.240
 it's still arguably, I mean, as far as objective beauty, it's hard to argue that Greco Roman,

57:44.800 --> 57:50.320
 it's just something about it with the columns. It's just, it's powerful. It's,

57:51.200 --> 57:56.080
 I don't know, even Ayn Rand would probably appreciate it. She doesn't know. No. No.

57:56.080 --> 58:03.920
 No. So in your history, Hyena's that unfortunately has come to an end before we're talking about

58:03.920 --> 58:11.120
 empires coming to an end, all empires fall. Yeah. That one, you may rise again,

58:11.120 --> 58:17.920
 empires might rise again. Who knows? Who knows? I'm obviously a fan, so I hope it does rise again.

58:17.920 --> 58:27.280
 But you've seemed to develop your own language. Can you, it's what it is. What is that?

58:28.240 --> 58:34.880
 What the hell? Is this some kind of medical condition or can you explain like the linguistic

58:34.880 --> 58:41.200
 essentials that catch us up to the linguistic essentials that people need to know to understand

58:41.200 --> 58:46.640
 the way you speak? Yeah. You know, Leopold and Loeb, the story of those two, they murdered that

58:46.640 --> 58:51.040
 kid and they had this weird relationship. Anyway, it's an interesting thing to Google.

58:51.040 --> 58:55.520
 Leopold and Loeb, these two guys who ended up murdering a kid because they developed their

58:55.520 --> 59:00.160
 own language with each other and this own reality and this weird thing and they wanted to know what

59:00.160 --> 59:04.400
 it's like to murder a kid and they murdered a kid. It's a famous story in American lore and history,

59:04.400 --> 59:11.280
 whatever, famous case. But this phenomenon, yeah, me and Chris got together. It wasn't as dark as

59:11.280 --> 59:18.240
 Leopold and Loeb. We didn't murder a kid, but we murdered a podcast. Or at least stab it a few times.

59:18.240 --> 59:24.720
 Yeah. It was something in the organic chemistry of me and Chris that I think we'll both

59:25.440 --> 59:32.560
 end up appreciating even probably more than we do now that it's mysterious. I got to be honest

59:32.560 --> 59:40.960
 with you. It was a thing that wasn't conscious, wasn't intentional. It was something that happened

59:40.960 --> 59:46.480
 in the music of our energies that just went. It's fascinating. Like when you hear someone

59:46.480 --> 59:52.080
 sing or when a jazz band hits a rhythm or even when I'm on stage and I just catch a rhythm,

59:52.080 --> 59:55.520
 it's like, dude, I didn't make a choice there. I don't know what that is. I don't know how to

59:55.520 --> 1:00:01.040
 explain it, but it comes from somewhere else and I don't know what it is. It's beyond my

1:00:01.040 --> 1:00:07.600
 comprehension, but with Chris, there was this magical chemistry that I have chemistry with a

1:00:07.600 --> 1:00:13.280
 lot of people and it can be funny. I feel zero chemistry here. This is great. It's a little

1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:21.040
 bit more intelligent than when me and Chris did. Me and Chris, I think we connected on the funny

1:00:21.040 --> 1:00:28.400
 bone. I found him so funny and we found the same things funny. From that, these organic

1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:35.360
 expressions came from some part of our brains that was created from this chemistry. We developed

1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:40.800
 this language and this cult following and people were really upset when we ended, but it was the

1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:45.440
 right thing to end because like all things that ended, it was kind of done a few episodes even

1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:52.960
 before we finished. I think we pulled the plug before it started rolling downhill. All great

1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:59.440
 flings. There's your long relationship, long marriages are boring and comfortable. The one

1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:06.400
 you really like fucking always ends abruptly and sadly, but you always look back and you jerk off

1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:14.960
 to it. So you guys made love? Yeah. It was like a hot fling with me and him and it was intense

1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:22.480
 and we burned the candle at both ends. I think that podcast was meant to be three years and

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:26.960
 maybe people will go back and appreciate it and listen to it over and over again.

1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:31.520
 And I think the new things we do, people will love. I'm doing long days now of that podcast and

1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:36.480
 people seem to enjoy it. I've been really enjoying the long days on YouTube. I just found myself

1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:42.480
 just like staring at you ranting for the same with Tim Dillon. I really enjoyed whatever those

1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:47.760
 rants are, the genius of just one thing after the other, but definitely the chemistry almost

1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:52.160
 is a study. I remember the reason I first started listening to it, I was trying to get

1:01:52.160 --> 1:02:00.080
 a perspective on certain historical moments. It was interesting. I tuned in to learn history.

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:05.360
 Yeah, I came for the history and stayed for the chaos.

1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:07.120
 Stayed for the crack open and clean out.

1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:16.160
 And yeah, it was almost, I listened to Rogan like this sometimes. I'll re listen to an episode

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:25.120
 to try to understand why was this so fun to listen to? It's almost like trying to analyze

1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:30.960
 humor or something like that, but it's nice from a conversational perspective. Why was this so easy

1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:39.040
 to listen to? And with history, Hain is like, why is the chemistry so good? It's so, it's weird.

1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:44.400
 It's weird because there's not many podcasts. I don't know any with chemistry like that.

1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:52.160
 It's interesting. And it's kind of sad that the fling with the prostitute in Vegas has to end.

1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:56.880
 But that's what makes it special. It's the Bukowski thing with the fog.

1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:03.840
 The British office, one of my favorite shows was that it ended very quickly. It's only a couple

1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:08.720
 seasons or something like that. And that was tragic, but that took guts to just end it.

1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:14.000
 Given all the money you could have made, given all the, you just end it. And that's what makes it

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.480
 like truly special. Yeah. And I'll tell you, man, I'll just emphasize it because I marvel at it too.

1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:25.280
 Because as a guy who tries to always figure out what the causes of things, I gotta be honest,

1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:29.520
 man, looking back on that, even with retrospective wisdom, you know, that 2020 hindsight, we've

1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:36.960
 been done a couple months now, it's something that I can't explain. It's something that I don't know

1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:43.360
 how you quantify it. I don't know how you describe it. It's musical. It's really kind of rhythmic.

1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:49.280
 So maybe, maybe like a Netflix show about history. That's, that's in the, that's in the future.

1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:56.320
 That with the two of you, you guys will meet like, with that, the way you meet with a fling,

1:03:56.320 --> 1:04:04.800
 like a decade from now, a diner, and you're both way fatter and uglier. And then you just reminisce

1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:10.000
 over some cigarettes and coffee. It could be. Yeah, it could be. Yeah. But it's definitely a

1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:15.760
 classic podcast that people can go back and appreciate. It's fast paced and it was unique.

1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:21.200
 What was it like to research for, I mean, it was really scholarly, the depth of research that you

1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:27.040
 performed. It sometimes felt like you almost read an entire Wikipedia article beforehand.

1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:37.680
 That's exactly true. We were, we were one fan. We attracted such funny people to that podcast,

1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:43.920
 and the fans were so funny. And one fan called us nicknamed as Wikipedia Sluts. And so it just

1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:48.480
 stuck. Yeah, we just would read Wikipedia. I would do a lot more research than Chris. Yeah.

1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:54.480
 And so I would actually, you know, once in a while, he'd get into it too. But for very interesting

1:04:54.480 --> 1:04:59.280
 episodes, I got some, some, some subject matter would just pull me in, like Bernie Madoff,

1:04:59.280 --> 1:05:02.320
 just to think of one that was recent. It was one of our last ones. And I think one of our better

1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:07.840
 episodes. And I'm glad that it kind of ended after that because it was rare to, I think we

1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:12.720
 started to slip a little bit. I got fascinated and I got, I did a lot of research for Bernie Madoff.

1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:17.200
 But usually, yeah, we pull up Wikipedia and we'd have fun. We were sort of the antithesis of

1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:23.040
 Dan Carlin. I mean, you went to Dan Carlin for accuracy and thoughtfulness. And you went to

1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:28.560
 us for, it was a hang with history. That's why History Hyenas was such an appropriate name,

1:05:28.560 --> 1:05:34.000
 because it was, it was a little bit of history. Some episodes were more hyena, more wild,

1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.520
 and a little history. And some were a little more dense, like the Battle of Crete and less

1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:41.760
 hyena. So you were always going to get both. You're either going to get a majority or one

1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:48.000
 or the other. Yeah. And Dan Carlin is the lion, I guess. And you guys are predictably good.

1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:54.400
 I mean, what are your thoughts about, I mean, he's a storyteller too. He gets a lot of criticism

1:05:54.400 --> 1:05:59.680
 for the, from the historians, quote unquote. That's why he likes to not, he keeps saying he's

1:05:59.680 --> 1:06:06.240
 not a historian. But what's your, what are your thoughts about hardcore history with Dan Carlin?

1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:15.680
 Like, was he an inspiration to the podcast you were doing? Or, or like an account, like almost

1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:20.880
 like reverse psychology inspiration, where you wanted to do some kind of opposing type of podcast

1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:29.040
 in history. Or was history, always just like a, a launching pad to just talk shit about human

1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:33.840
 nature? More of the latter. I wasn't even aware of his podcast when we started. Oh, interesting.

1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:38.720
 Yeah. And so we, it was just very organic. Again, like the chemistry, me and Chris became

1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:43.680
 very good friends. We started the podcast. First, we did a web series called Bay Ridge Boys,

1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:47.200
 which has a sort of little cult following. We did like five episodes and ended it.

1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:53.120
 And then we did the podcast. And Hyena's were my favorite animal. And I talk about them passionately.

1:06:53.120 --> 1:06:56.960
 And I told Chris about them. And then he started appreciating them. And we both love history.

1:06:56.960 --> 1:07:00.800
 I majored in history. It's one of the things I love. I go to museums all the time. I go to his,

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:05.920
 I do history tours. So does he. And so it was just sort of a natural, let's do a history podcast.

1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:11.360
 And it gave us something to talk about each episode to sort of lean our, you know, hang our hats on

1:07:11.360 --> 1:07:16.320
 and riff off of. So it had nothing to do with dance. What I think about dance, I think it's great.

1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:23.200
 I think even if he's inaccurate in the opinions of the historical community, it starts conversations,

1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:28.080
 which is good. It's like this thing where people go, oh, it's dangerous rhetoric. It's like, no,

1:07:28.080 --> 1:07:33.520
 rhetoric only becomes dangerous when education fails. What's going on in America is education has

1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:39.200
 failed. So if you call someone online dangerous, it's not him that's dangerous. It's the fucking

1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:43.200
 stupid people that's dangerous. And it's the fault of this country. We didn't listen to Aristotle.

1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:50.640
 The future of a civilization depends on public education. And we failed. Education has failed.

1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:56.720
 Kids are kids are not interested in shit. And so in some sense, those like Dan's podcast and

1:07:57.440 --> 1:08:03.680
 podcasts can be incredibly educational. That's he's a, the storytelling that pulls you in

1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:10.400
 ultimately leads to you internalizing these stories and like remembering them and thinking

1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:14.880
 through them and all those kinds of things that is much more powerful than any book on history

1:08:14.880 --> 1:08:19.600
 that's accurate. I think often it inspires you to go learn more. So it's like, I know we did that.

1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:23.680
 I mean, you know, people would go, I went and learned about this because they knew with us

1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:28.400
 there was no pretense, which was great that we had no standard. So it's like nobody came to us

1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:35.120
 for historical accuracy. But I was kind of turned on by the fact that it inspired people to go learn

1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:40.400
 about this stuff or to at least know like Battle of Crete, like you said, a very underappreciated

1:08:40.400 --> 1:08:47.600
 battle. Even Winston Churchill said, from here on, we will no longer say that Greeks fight like

1:08:47.600 --> 1:08:53.600
 heroes, but heroes fight like Greeks. I mean, it was a monumental battle and, you know, not

1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:59.280
 talked about enough. And our podcast would inspire people to go actually learn more,

1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:04.160
 to go listen to Dan Carlin or to go pick up a book or to do research on their own. And so

1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:09.840
 I think podcasts, Dan Carlin's obviously much more accurate than us, but it's good that people are

1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:16.400
 going to podcasts like yours and to learn shit. Joe is really like the progenitor of that. I mean,

1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:22.480
 you know, having intellectuals on and getting the public interested with this new medium

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:29.440
 in people who are intelligent. It's nice because, you know, what the mainstream press pushes out

1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:37.680
 is horseshit, gorgeous horseshit. It's got a beautiful veneer, but no substance. And so this,

1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:43.200
 this is a nice pushback. Yeah, the authenticity of Joe's show. I mean, I'm through, I started

1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:49.600
 listening from the very beginning, you know, doing my in grad school, you know, like a technical

1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:54.080
 person. And he just pulled me in and made me curious to learn about all kinds of things

1:09:54.080 --> 1:10:00.880
 and use my own critical reasoning skills on some of the bullshit guests he's had and some of the

1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:06.800
 most inspiring guests he's had. And so I teach you to think, can you, I don't know much about

1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:11.840
 Bernie Madoff as a small tangent. Can you tell me who the hell is Bernie Madoff? Oh, Bernie Madoff

1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:18.560
 is the goat, the greatest thief of all time, dude. Hedge fund guy, ran a hedge fund and

1:10:18.560 --> 1:10:25.360
 pulled, stole the most money in the history of America. I mean, a con artist. And he does,

1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:30.480
 people obviously, he's become, he's a household name because of the magnitude of his crime.

1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:35.120
 But you got to appreciate, again, you got to appreciate what went into this and how long

1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:40.960
 he was able to pull it off by tricking the smartest and richest people in the world.

1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:48.400
 And a brilliant scam. The con man, a con man is short for confidence man. And it came from,

1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:54.880
 yeah, a con man, basically they exude confidence and they trick people by playing on their ego and

1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:59.280
 blind spots. And the word comes from a guy I can't remember where, but what do you, what do you

1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:03.920
 used to do? I can't remember the guy's name, whatever, you can Google it, con man. But it's

1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:08.080
 very interesting. The first con man that is on record, what do we do? We just go to very rich

1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:14.480
 people and he'd be very well dressed, right? And he'd go, I bet you, you don't have the confidence

1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:19.120
 to give me your watch. And he would plan the egos, these very powerful and rich people,

1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:23.120
 and they would give them the watch for some reason, some sort of reverse psychology bullshit.

1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:27.360
 And he'd take the watch and he would just steal it. Because basically saying like, I don't,

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:29.760
 you don't have the compass to give me the watch because you don't, I don't know, you don't think

1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:33.600
 I'm going to give it back. And he would just take it. So Bernie Madoff was a very sophisticated

1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:37.680
 sophisticated con man. And again, we were talking about people pretending to be the opposite of

1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:46.000
 what they are. Bernie hid his fevery in how available he was to his clients, how he would

1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:49.680
 show up at every bar mitzvah, every birthday. He was always available for their phone calls.

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:55.760
 And he played on their egos. He made it so people were wanted to invest in him. Like they were

1:11:55.760 --> 1:12:00.800
 competing. He made it very exclusive. He wouldn't just take anyone. And there was a method behind

1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:07.360
 that madness because he wanted the whales that wouldn't notice that he was, he had this pyramid

1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:11.200
 scheme going. And so what he would do is he would just rob from the richer and he just kept,

1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:15.440
 it was like, he'd pay back the richer with the guy who was a little, and it was a pyramid scheme.

1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:22.080
 And he was able to do it for so long and steal so much money. And he would win people over with

1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:26.400
 the scheme because with that scheme, he was the only guy who could provide, who could guarantee

1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:33.360
 like a 1% return even during times of recession. And because he was such a good con man, he hijacked

1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:37.600
 people's reasoning with his charm. And that's what con artists do. That's what psychopaths do.

1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:41.920
 They're so fucking charming. They get you in that Volkswagen Beetle because if they use their

1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:47.040
 reasoning for one second, they'd go, Hey, nobody can provide 1% returns during recessions. How the

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:50.960
 fuck is this guy doing it? I'll tell you how he's doing it. He's stealing from another guy to pay

1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:57.040
 you. You fucking idiot. So charisma is essential to that. Maybe you can help explain something

1:12:57.040 --> 1:13:01.520
 to me, something I have been affected by. I'm getting way too loud for your listeners.

1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:04.320
 It's just going to be calm. It's like, tell this guy to calm down. I'm sorry. I'm Greek

1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:12.720
 apostate. No, it is beautiful. I love it. This is something that I have been thinking about

1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:19.680
 and have encountered indirectly is Jeffrey Epstein. And I have a sense because of MIT,

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:26.160
 because of all the other people that have been touched the wrong term by Jeffrey Epstein in the

1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:34.000
 sense that literally and figuratively. And it's always felt to me like there's not a deep

1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:39.920
 conspiracy. I don't know. I don't know, but it felt to me like it's not some deeply rooted

1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:47.840
 conspiracy where like Eric Weinstein thinks that there's some probability that Jeffrey Epstein is

1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:54.960
 a front for like an intelligence agency, whether it's Israeli or the CIA, I don't know, but is a

1:13:54.960 --> 1:14:01.440
 front for something much, much bigger. And then I always thought that he's just maybe you can correct

1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:09.280
 me, but more of the Bernie Madoff variety where he's just a charismatic guy who maybe a psychopathic

1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:15.840
 in some sense. So, you know, also a pedophile, but just charismatic and is able to convince people

1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:22.320
 of that 1% of any idea that in the case of scientists is able to convince these people that

1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:28.640
 their ideas matter. So, one thing scientists don't really, you know, despite what people say, I don't

1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:32.640
 think they care about money as much as people think. People are ridiculous when they think that,

1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:36.400
 yeah, that's why people get into science for the money. The personalities that get into science are

1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:42.400
 obsessed with minutiae and they do the scientific method. You know how boring that is? Like you

1:14:42.400 --> 1:14:49.760
 have to have a love for it in order to do it. Love and truth. What drives you is for your ideas to

1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:56.160
 be then heard. And when a rich guy comes over, probably super charismatic, is going to tell you

1:14:56.160 --> 1:15:02.240
 that your ideas, especially for some of these outsiders at MIT, at Harvard, at Caltech, at all

1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:11.840
 these like sort of big science, like physics, biology, artificial intelligence, computing fields,

1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:18.320
 to hear somebody say that your ideas are brilliant and ideas matter, it's pretty powerful,

1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:23.520
 especially when you've been an outsider. Like he's talked to a bunch of people who were,

1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:31.600
 who had outsider ideas. You know, the big negative for me of modern academia is that

1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:37.040
 most people, actually like most communities, most people think the same and there's just

1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:42.400
 these brilliant outsiders and the outsiders are just derided. And so, when you have

1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:48.800
 Jeffrey Epstein, like Hyena, sorry, sorry, sorry, going from on the outside and picking off these

1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:53.040
 brilliant minds that are the outsiders, he can use charisma to convince them to

1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:00.320
 collaborate with him, to take his funding and then thereby he builds a reputation,

1:16:01.040 --> 1:16:08.080
 like slowly accumulates these people that actually results in a network of like some of

1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:13.440
 those brilliant people in the world, you know, and then pulls in people like Bill Gates and,

1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:19.280
 I don't know, political figures. I tend to believe one person can do that.

1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:24.160
 Yeah. I mean, look at Hitler, charisma is blinding. I think that's what Conman,

1:16:24.160 --> 1:16:30.880
 speaking of Bernie Madoff, that's one of their major tools is flattery, just glib, superficial

1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:35.360
 charm. It creates those blind spots. People want to hear how great they are. They want to be

1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:41.920
 flattered. It takes your defenses down. It plays to our ego how much we're all just pieces of

1:16:41.920 --> 1:16:46.320
 garbage and want to hear how great we are. We want that love from our mother and our father.

1:16:46.320 --> 1:16:52.640
 It's Freudian and they know because they're not burdened with that need, they're not burdened with

1:16:52.640 --> 1:17:00.320
 that empathy or emotions and they just see things very calculatively. They play, they know that

1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:07.120
 we're prey in their game and they use that against us and that is why someone who is not that intelligent

1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:12.160
 like Hitler can probably convince a lot more intelligent people, you know, and that's why

1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:16.000
 we can't give him dill in power because, you know, he already stands on a stage. I mean,

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:20.160
 if we let that guy, I mean, he will just take over a country and everyone who can't cook well

1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:24.400
 will be eliminated. Yeah. So it's like, I wonder why he keeps complimenting me while we're in

1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:29.920
 private. Exactly. Be careful. He looks at me just, you're, I like your suit. I like the cut of your

1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:35.520
 jib. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, you gotta be careful of that kid. He's Hitler. But it's crazy to think

1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:39.520
 about that. Clip that, please, internet. I mean, Quentin Tarantino said it to Ben. I mean, in his

1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:46.560
 grip, personality goes a long way, dude. Yeah. I mean, personality can usurp common sense and

1:17:46.560 --> 1:17:53.200
 reason of the smartest people. These absolute smartest people can be hypnotized. It's sort of

1:17:53.200 --> 1:17:57.920
 like a sexy woman. It's like, you can just, it just, you can be tricked because we have such a

1:17:57.920 --> 1:18:05.600
 blind spot for, you know, for, for flattery. Yeah, I wonder, I think there's a BBC documentary on,

1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:10.480
 I think it's called something like Charisma, Hitler's Charisma or something like that.

1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:16.560
 There's quite, I mean, that one focused more about the power of the speeches. But I wonder if

1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:23.680
 most of the success or the rise of Hitler and the Third Reich had to do with the Charisma of

1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:29.680
 Hitler when he's alone in a room with somebody, with the generals, just one on one. Like, I wonder,

1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:35.360
 I wonder if that's the essential element of just being able to just look into a person's eyes,

1:18:36.320 --> 1:18:42.560
 like flatter them or whatever is needed to earn their trust and then convince them of anything

1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:48.640
 you want. Right. Yeah. I mean, you're right. Cause that's, that's the one piece of history we don't

1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:54.880
 have. We don't know. We don't know. We do know that the kid crushed. I mean, he was a headliner.

1:18:54.880 --> 1:19:01.360
 He got up there and his, his hair would flopper. I mean, he crushed it. Yeah. There's certain

1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:07.760
 elements about nationalism and pride that are really powerful. Like a lot of us humans, I think,

1:19:07.760 --> 1:19:13.200
 long for that, for the feeling of belonging. And when some charismatic leader makes us feel

1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:20.880
 like we belong to a group, the, uh, the amount of evil we can do to other humans because of that

1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:26.320
 is endless scapegoat. Nobody wants to look in. Nobody wants to do the work to be better or look

1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:29.200
 at where they messed up. Why does it always have to be the Jews that are the scapegoats?

1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:35.520
 You know, it's like, get over it guys. I mean, it's like they killed Jesus. You get over it.

1:19:35.520 --> 1:19:40.160
 Yeah. Okay. It's a long time ago. I mean, move on. I'm Jewish. I understand because we do run

1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:45.440
 the central banks and the weather and the weather. Yeah. Don't forget about the weather. That's a

1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:48.960
 big one. That's a funny one that people created. Like, who gives a shit? Well, what is the weather?

1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:51.760
 Like, what's the importance of the weather? All right. The Jews made a rain outside. Good,

1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:54.800
 you got a fucking, you know, they made it snow. Okay. You get a day off. Thank the Jews. Yeah.

1:19:54.800 --> 1:19:59.840
 It's like, yeah, there's certain conspiracies that make me like flat earth. Like what, what's the

1:19:59.840 --> 1:20:04.720
 motive? Like what, who, what's the motivation for lying that the earth is round? Like, what's the

1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:09.680
 conspiracy? Yeah. What does anyone get out of that? Yeah. What is exactly the profit? What's,

1:20:09.680 --> 1:20:14.640
 what's the, yeah, what's the strategy? Do you have any, from a historical perspective,

1:20:14.640 --> 1:20:19.840
 or just a human perspective conspiracy theories you connect with, or you're not necessarily

1:20:19.840 --> 1:20:27.920
 conspiratorial? I'm, I'm not necessarily conspiratorial. Nobody cares that much. But there,

1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:34.000
 but then you, you know, what happens is you find out this one or this two.

1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:38.160
 You start questioning everything. And you start questioning everything, man. It's like,

1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:44.000
 you know, the Vietnam war started, that was a lie. That was a false flag. And then next thing,

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:50.160
 you know, everything's a false flag. There are some strange things on 9 11. You know, there's

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:54.240
 some strange things from a scientific perspective. I'm no scientist, but it's like, you know, yeah,

1:20:54.240 --> 1:21:01.440
 three steel framed skyscrapers falling on the same day in the same way. A lot of people

1:21:01.440 --> 1:21:04.560
 say, oh, it was the, they were hit by planes. It's like, yeah, but that's not where they fell.

1:21:04.560 --> 1:21:12.160
 They fell because of fires and usually, not usually, all the time, except for three times.

1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:15.520
 And there was buildings that have burned for longer than that.

1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:21.280
 And there might be good explanations, but the lack of transparency, it's like, I feel like

1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:25.840
 government, I'm building sevens weird. I mean, the way I kind of, I'm just a neat, just a neat

1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:31.040
 the physical, I mean, you're a scientist. Is that, well, I don't, I, is there resistance from the

1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:36.000
 steel? And so no, free fall, not all scientists know everything. I'm just a computer guy.

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:39.200
 Okay. Cause I had some questions I wanted to ask about my biology.

1:21:40.080 --> 1:21:43.920
 Yeah. So exactly. I don't understand biology. I don't understand the melting point of steel. I

1:21:43.920 --> 1:21:50.000
 don't, but I'm just a common sense human that looks at government and institutions when they try

1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:55.920
 to communicate. And there's a certain human element where you can sense that there's dishonesty

1:21:55.920 --> 1:22:00.000
 going on. That dishonesty might not be deeply rooted in a conspiracy theory and something

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:06.320
 malevolent. It might just be rooted more likely to me in a basic fear of losing your job.

1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:06.720
 Right.

1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:10.800
 And so when you have a bunch of people that are afraid of losing their job, you know, and they

1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:16.720
 just don't want to, like the origins of the virus, whether it came from a lab or not, you know,

1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:23.360
 that's a pretty, I know a lot of biologists behind a closed doors that, that say it's very likely

1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:28.240
 it was leaked from the lab, but like they don't want to talk about it because there's not good

1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:33.200
 evidence either way. It's mostly you're just using common sense. So they're waiting for good evidence

1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:39.280
 to come out in either direction, but just like nobody in positions of institutional like centralized

1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:44.640
 power wants to just honestly say, we don't know, or on the point of masks or all those kinds of

1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:48.800
 things to say, you know, here's the best evidence we have. We're not sure we're trying to figure

1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:53.600
 that. We're desperately trying to figure that out or just like honesty, especially in the modern

1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:59.040
 day. That's the hope I have for the 21st centuries. People seem to detect bullshit much, much better

1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:04.240
 because the internet internet. Yeah. Yeah. And we, we also believe crazy shit too. There's no

1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:11.280
 yin without a yang, I guess. But I think the conspiracy theories arise only when the people

1:23:11.280 --> 1:23:16.080
 in positions of power and government and institutions are full of shit. Like the air

1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:19.920
 will be taken out of the conspiracy theories. If the people in elected power would be much

1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:24.720
 more honest, like just like real people like Andrew Yang, whatever you think about him,

1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:30.160
 just more honest. He, he just like says whatever the hell comes to mind. By the way,

1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:36.480
 he's running for New York mayor. Do you have opinions? Yeah, it's no good. I like Andrew

1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:41.600
 Yang and it's no good. I'd be honest with you. I'm a lifelong New Yorker. I mean, I'm a New Yorker.

1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:46.800
 Well, you're in New York, so nothing's good. Well, something is good. Okay. And talking on,

1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:52.720
 let's be honest about New York. It's a very socially liberal place. It is the head of the snake.

1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:57.120
 New York is the country. If New York, when New York's not doing good, country's not doing good.

1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:04.480
 It's the most important city, DC, New York. It's really Rome, be honest. It's, it's a, maybe I'm

1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:10.080
 biased. I don't know. No. We just did New York as we walk around everywhere and we go, this is

1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:16.960
 just like New York, but not New York. It's, um, but and New York needs, and I'm a guy who leans

1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:21.280
 left. I, you know, I just, I'd lean left and that's just what it is. A dictator. Is that where

1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:27.360
 you're going? No, we need, we need, it's a money town. Let's be, come on, man. I mean, New York

1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:35.280
 is a money town and, uh, Wall Street. And then when AOC and her cronies, um, at the local level

1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:40.160
 rejected that Amazon thing, you're going like, what do you think makes cities? What, what, what's

1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:45.360
 going to create jobs in the 21st century? What do we need? More nail salons, more pizza places?

1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:50.160
 I mean, we're living in the tech revolution and, you know, whatever your opinions are about Jeff

1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:55.920
 Bezos, that's the world tech. And they want you to come here. Of course you give them tax breaks.

1:24:55.920 --> 1:25:01.040
 That's why any companies go anywhere. She's so fucking utopian and that, that progressive wing

1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:07.680
 is so utopian and that always ends in disaster because not rooted in reality. It doesn't accept

1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:12.240
 the reality that people are self interested. Now they're going to do this 14%, 15% tax hike

1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:16.080
 on people making a million dollars more in New York city. A million dollars is not that much.

1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:20.480
 So people are going to flee New York. The tax base is going to flee. New York's going to fall to

1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:24.720
 shit like it did before. So you're saying it basically needs a more capitalist front, like

1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:28.640
 capitalistic type of thing here. Bloomberg, Giuliani, when he was still saying,

1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:33.520
 and his hair wasn't melting off his face, prosecutor, you need a tough, I mean,

1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:37.440
 I don't know what's happened to that guy's lost it, but it's fun. Yeah, it's fun to watch. Yeah,

1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:41.120
 it's fun to watch him be just like Trump's lacking. Like, yeah, boy, whatever you want,

1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:47.040
 boss, I'll just say whatever you want, boss. But New York is a money town that needs a money guy

1:25:47.040 --> 1:25:51.760
 and sort of more of a Republican. I have to say on the local level, as more of a guy who leans

1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:57.040
 left, I'll just be honest, it's a tough city that needs a tough mayor, not some guy who's

1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:02.480
 going like, I understand we all need free money. Andrew Yang, I think, is right in the big picture

1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:06.000
 because all the real jobs are somewhere else. You look at those Asian cities, you go like,

1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.800
 oh, that's what our cities used to look like at the Industrial Revolution. There was jobs and

1:26:10.800 --> 1:26:14.560
 people were making things here. And now you look at those cities in Asia and you're going like,

1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:18.080
 wow. And then you go to Detroit and you're like, yeah, we're done. You go to Cleveland,

1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:24.800
 you go, we're done. So I don't actually, it's funny. The reason I really like Andrew Yang is

1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:30.320
 I've learned a lot every time he talks. Like, it's not his opinions. He's just giving a lot of data,

1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:35.200
 like information, which I just start a podcast, don't run from there. That's true. He already has

1:26:35.200 --> 1:26:41.520
 a podcast. I think Yang speaks. Who does it? Who does it? That's the way we communicate. I don't

1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:46.720
 even talk to people unless it's on a podcast. Listen, man, I'm not going to criticize that

1:26:46.720 --> 1:26:52.960
 because there is something like I talked to my dad on a podcast for four hours. And I'm not sure

1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:57.760
 I would, I would ever talk to him in the way we talked without the podcast. What does he do?

1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:06.960
 Physicist. Oh, shit. But like, yeah, it's episode 100. And, you know,

1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:15.520
 I, the way I recorded that podcast is I tried to put my ego aside. It's actually really tough to

1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:21.520
 talk to your dad, especially because you're giving him a platform. Especially at that time,

1:27:21.520 --> 1:27:28.320
 there's already a bit of a platform for this podcast. And so there's this, as a son, you think,

1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:33.440
 like, oh, here it goes with this bullshit again. Like that's the natural son thought you have.

1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:39.680
 But at the same time, I wanted to, the way I thought about it is in 20 years when I look back,

1:27:39.680 --> 1:27:44.640
 like I want to do a conversation where I'm happy with it. You know, so I want to make him shine.

1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:51.680
 But I also called him out on like, why are you so distant? Like, like all that kind of stuff.

1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:55.280
 Yeah, it was very difficult to do, but it was really important to do. And I don't think I'd be

1:27:55.280 --> 1:28:01.120
 able to do without a, without a microphone. Right. Listen, how often do we sit there and just focus

1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:06.880
 our attention, just look at the other person? I don't know, man, this is not even recording right

1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:12.880
 now. I just invited you over. Just so we could actually, you're right. The podcast does make,

1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:16.400
 like I listened, I've been listening to every word you've been saying. And if we weren't doing a

1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:20.960
 podcast, I might be looking at my phone or being self conscious about something else or nervous

1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:25.920
 or anxious. Especially with people close to you. I mean, that was, I recommend that actually for

1:28:25.920 --> 1:28:32.000
 people to talk to their family on a podcast or like a fake or not. That's really powerful.

1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:36.560
 It made me realize that there's a clear distinction between the conversations we

1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:41.280
 usually have with humans and those we have on the podcast as being recorded.

1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:44.640
 What the fuck were we talking about before that?

1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:48.960
 I knew you were going to lose your train of thought on that one because that's a big one.

1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:52.240
 There's a motion behind that one. The podcast with dad is going to take,

1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:57.040
 that's going to take you to a place. It took you to a place. It took you outside of interviewer.

1:28:57.040 --> 1:29:02.320
 New York. It went to a place in New York and Yang. So the data, one of the things that really

1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:07.200
 surprised me about, I like the psycho analysis you just threw in there.

1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:12.560
 Yeah, that took you to a place. So Angie Yang mentioned,

1:29:12.560 --> 1:29:18.480
 Can you respect me now, dad? MIT, is it enough? Fuck a million people listening to this?

1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:23.680
 I got 14 Rogans. Is it enough, dad? I'm creating robots. Is it enough for you?

1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:27.040
 Yeah. That's what drives you probably. That probably what drives me.

1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:29.360
 That's what gives meaning to life is it's never enough.

1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:34.480
 And I hope to pass that on to my kids one day that nothing's ever enough.

1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:37.280
 Whether they're robot or human, right? Your kids.

1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:40.640
 Most likely. Let's be honest. Robot. You might call one of your robot. Do you love your robot?

1:29:40.640 --> 1:29:43.760
 Are you starting to love your, is it going to be like that Pygmalion thing? You create them and

1:29:43.760 --> 1:29:46.000
 then they kill you. But even while they're killing you, you got a tear roll.

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:50.320
 The tear, a slow one tear, one tear and just. Yeah. Why are you doing this Frankenstein?

1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:55.520
 Why? Why? But I loved you. Those would be the last words out of my mouth.

1:29:56.320 --> 1:30:06.080
 But Angie Yang mentioned something on the, that it costs a $400,000 over $400,000 per year to

1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:14.240
 support one person in prison in New York. Like when I heard that number, it was really confusing to

1:30:14.240 --> 1:30:22.640
 me. Like that it costs that much for $400,000 per person. And it was really refreshing to hear a

1:30:22.640 --> 1:30:29.200
 politician describe a particular problem with data, that this is this prison industrial complex,

1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:33.760
 whatever the hell it is. And whether the solution, it's unclear what the solution is.

1:30:33.760 --> 1:30:39.200
 I think he has solutions, but just the honesty of presenting that information was refreshing.

1:30:39.200 --> 1:30:43.920
 And I'm not sure a capitalistic person would solve that. Those kinds of problems he might

1:30:43.920 --> 1:30:49.120
 make worse. And I'm not, you know, I'm a huge fan of capitalism. I think,

1:30:51.040 --> 1:30:54.320
 I think the free market is the way we make progress in this world. But

1:30:55.120 --> 1:31:00.240
 it seems to go wrong in certain directions, like the military industrial complex, the prison

1:31:00.240 --> 1:31:07.440
 industrial, anything that ends with industrial complex. And so I'm not sure. I'm not sure if

1:31:07.440 --> 1:31:14.720
 all of the problems, you're basically saying, let's put New York's problems aside.

1:31:16.400 --> 1:31:20.400
 We need to have New York shine first to do what it does best.

1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:21.440
 Essentially, yeah.

1:31:21.440 --> 1:31:26.400
 And then the problems will fix them. Well, and then we can focus on the problems. But if you

1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:29.920
 just say like, here's a problem, here's a problem, here's a problem, let's make sure we have the

1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:33.760
 safety net that protects against all of these kinds of problems. That's not going to,

1:31:33.760 --> 1:31:39.200
 that's going to kill the city, the spirit of the city that is in your biased opinion,

1:31:39.200 --> 1:31:44.480
 the Rome of the world. That said, a lot of people are fleeing New York.

1:31:44.480 --> 1:31:48.240
 Yeah, that's why I say it. That's the reality of the situation is, you know,

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:53.440
 I'm all for the public good. But yeah, there needs to be back to that Greek expression,

1:31:53.440 --> 1:31:58.640
 pan metronarist. And I also think the free market is responsible for progress.

1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:01.840
 I think it's the most natural thing, the thing that's most aligned with human nature,

1:32:01.840 --> 1:32:07.200
 which is self interest, and which I believe not to the extent that I in Randwood, but I do believe

1:32:07.200 --> 1:32:12.640
 people are mostly self interested, especially with one gun to the head. Morals are out the window,

1:32:12.640 --> 1:32:17.840
 you know, it's about survival. So, you know, create a system that respects that and acknowledges that.

1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:24.880
 But socialism works very well, at least right now, as a check as to temper the excesses of

1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:32.080
 capitalism and in certain scenarios, is the more appropriate system, you know, in a vacuum. So one

1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:41.040
 being prisons or, you know, governance, you know, maybe even, well, and this is a difficult one,

1:32:41.040 --> 1:32:45.440
 but in healthcare, healthcare, it's unclear what to write. There's a lot of the base there.

1:32:45.440 --> 1:32:50.800
 Yeah, doctors want boats. So I guess you're voting for AOC, you're saying.

1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:55.680
 No, I'm not voting for AOC, but I do. It's just a tough one. That's a tough one. But

1:32:56.480 --> 1:33:02.240
 ultimately, the Hippocratic oath, it's like, how do you turn people away, man? How do you do that

1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:11.200
 to people? It's like, it's a tough thing to reconcile helping people, curing people with

1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:16.960
 the marketplace. It's just, I can understand why that one's so tough. And then you got

1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:21.280
 hypochondriacs, of course, who drain the system, you know, like people who are having anxiety like

1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:27.760
 me, who had COVID and called 14, you know, I called 14 ambulances. So, and then, of course,

1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:32.000
 we're fat and the free market made us fat because it played the marketing made us want all this

1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:35.280
 junk food and that's a burden on the healthcare system. So we got to do something about that.

1:33:35.280 --> 1:33:39.040
 We got to get creative. We need new thinkers. I'll be one of them. When you go to a fast food

1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:43.120
 restaurant, you stand on a scale. If you're over a certain thing, you can't be served.

1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:47.280
 It's good for the healthcare system. You know, you just handed a salad and say, sorry,

1:33:47.280 --> 1:33:55.360
 this burger's illegal for right now. If you achieve these certain BMI goals, then you can have this

1:33:55.360 --> 1:34:00.320
 burger, but right now you can. And that's where the state's important. Okay, to regulate our freedoms.

1:34:00.320 --> 1:34:05.680
 No slurpees up with you, Bloomberg. Well, I'm with you to go along. I think the salads are too

1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:11.120
 expensive. They should be subsidized. If you go to like a fast food joint, the burger is always

1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:14.960
 going to be cheaper than the salad. And this does not make sense. We should run on this platform.

1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:20.880
 I'll be your vice president. Well, ban burgers for people over a certain way and make salads cheap.

1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:24.640
 Three day work weeks. Why has that been happening? Okay, where are you going with this one?

1:34:24.640 --> 1:34:30.160
 Dude, good for the economy stimulates the economy, right? More shifts creates more jobs,

1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:33.680
 more people spending because they have more leisure time boosts the leisure economy.

1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:38.800
 Why are we still doing the five day work week that that was that was tempered from the seven

1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:42.400
 day work week. That was so the seven, it used to be seven day work. It used to be like,

1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:47.200
 people who are just these libertarians, like, come on, dude, what is this fresh? Are we freshmen

1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:50.800
 in college? Yeah, you get it. We're going to talk about iron ran next. Like, let's talk about

1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:56.960
 reality. Okay. And human nature. People are fucking greedy. They lie. You know, there's no end to up,

1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:01.600
 which is one of my favorite expressions. No end to up. No end to up. There's no end to up.

1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:06.800
 But can we dissect that? Yeah, from a Randian perspective, there's no end to up, which is

1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:12.160
 you just keep going. It's never enough. Oh, never enough. It's never enough. No end to up. More,

1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:16.640
 more, more. And, you know, you have to reconcile, you're going to die. So like, there's no end

1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:26.960
 to up thing is that balance is just as valuable as progress. So we have to reconcile those two

1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:32.960
 things and put them on a seesaw and figure out how to get two people who have the equal weight

1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:38.000
 to keep it like that. And that's the goal. And it constantly vacillates according to the time.

1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.640
 You sometimes you need a little more socialism, sometimes you need a little more capitalism.

1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:44.720
 You got to, you got to, you got to fly the plane, man. You got to fly the plane, dude.

1:35:44.720 --> 1:35:53.360
 What's your looking back at history? Is there a moment time period in history, a person in history

1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:57.760
 that's most fascinating to you? You mentioned birdie made up. Maybe second to birdie made up.

1:35:57.760 --> 1:36:01.680
 Is there in a battle of Crete? Is there something that you've always been curious about, even if

1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:05.440
 it's something you haven't actually researched that well yet, just something that pulled your

1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:11.040
 curiosity that instructed the way you think about the world. An individual or an event or

1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:17.600
 event, individual, you know, yeah, moment in history or person in history.

1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:26.400
 There's a few, but, you know, Queen Elizabeth, the Elizabethan era, you know, the sun never

1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:35.120
 sets in the British Empire, very successful empire. What an absolute success story that is

1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:41.840
 for a leader and a woman. Can you tell a little bit about her story? I actually don't know much

1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:45.200
 about the British Empire. Yeah, she had a good run. I think it's like 70 years, you know, as a

1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:50.480
 Shakespeare, they, you know, the, oh, I guess what's the word, Pax Romana, the, the, the period of

1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:55.440
 Rome that was that peace and they flourished like a couple of error emperors like Trajan or

1:36:55.440 --> 1:37:00.320
 some good ones. And I think he was part of the Pax Romana that sort of just a peace and a comfortable

1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:06.880
 flourishing time. And England had sort of that in their empire under her successful reign. She

1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:12.160
 murdered her cousin. She, you know, the movies, there's, you know, Kate Blanchett plays her and,

1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:18.320
 and does so. And she didn't win the Oscar because fucking Gwyneth Paltrow put a, put a British accent

1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:22.640
 on in Shakespeare in love. It's a tragedy. Why do I know this? Because I'm not a full man. I'm a

1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:28.640
 comedian, which means I do skits that I perform. And I, Kate Blanchett's incredible actress,

1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:35.440
 great movies. She was just so, and here's the thing, she, she never got married. She was, she was so

1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:43.920
 astute at public relations. And, and, and, and imagine how strong you got to be as a woman to

1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:50.560
 lead the greatest empire, maybe known to man at the time, and to do so, so successfully, how

1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:54.080
 Machiavellian you have to be, how idealist you have to be, how much of a good marketer you

1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:59.680
 have to be, propaganda machine was on point. She was married to England. She was adored the way

1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:05.120
 she adorned herself. You walked in, you're like, holy men, God just walked in here. And of course,

1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:11.360
 she got fucked. I mean, who doesn't fuck? We all fuck. Even robots one day will fuck. But she was,

1:38:11.360 --> 1:38:17.840
 she, she did that propaganda thing. And historians aren't, haven't, they haven't decided this,

1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:26.080
 but I believe she fucked. And I believe she did that as a tool of propaganda, a marry to England.

1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:30.960
 So you, oh, you're directly referring to like using sex as a way to manipulate people?

1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:36.800
 Well, she, her, she was known as like the, the Virgin Queen. And, and her thing was like,

1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:40.640
 I'm married to England. Like I can't be distracted by man or woman, blah, blah, blah,

1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:46.800
 she never had any kids, nothing. I think she did that as a tool of manipulation.

1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:52.480
 Yes. What you need, rulers need to, you know, Obama made you feel good and then he went and

1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:58.000
 carpet bombed everywhere. You need to feel good about your guy, no matter how evil they are.

1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:02.560
 And she was fucking a dictator. But when you look back at her, everyone's like, oh my God,

1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:08.000
 she was so great. The horror and the shit that she had to do, she didn't put that in history books.

1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:14.240
 But that's what probably was part of what made her successful. And she's a fascinating character

1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:20.400
 to partner with because she was so successful and, and England flourished so much. And it's

1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:24.800
 just fascinating to me because she was the great Virgin Queen. And can you think of a,

1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:29.840
 there's no other woman who was that say, I mean, Angela Merkel. I mean, come on. I mean,

1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:34.400
 there's nobody who comes close and defeating the Spanish or Mata. I think that happened under

1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:40.240
 her. I mean, I'm no professionalist, but I mean, the woman crushed. And do you think it's more

1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:46.560
 effective to lead by love, which it sounds like what she did from the PR perspective or by fear?

1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:51.280
 Where do you land on that? That's a great question. We got to ask Joe.

1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:58.240
 Well, yeah, this is interesting because I think leading in the 21st century in whatever ways is

1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:04.960
 different. I think it's very difficult to lead by fear. I mean, that's why I find Putin fascinating

1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:12.960
 and like really fascinating. Like, is he a relic of another era or is he something that

1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:16.000
 will still be necessary in the coming decades for certain nations?

1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:21.200
 I think he's a, I don't think he's a relic from another era. I think his background,

1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:26.000
 I think he is who you think he is because his background was an espionage. His background

1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:30.480
 was in subterfusion espionage. I think I've said the word subterfusion maybe 10 times now,

1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:37.040
 but he... You like big words, intellectuals. I'm just sitting here with you. It's time to flex.

1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:44.160
 But he's very good at that, right? Like controlling people with psychology and

1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:49.520
 even if you look at the way he sort of used the internet and has sort of been, you know,

1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:57.360
 gotten into the citizens of other countries opinions and it's very KGB. He also looks great

1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:03.680
 without a shirt on a pony. On a horse. On a horse. Yeah. Yeah. I thought he would choose a pony

1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:08.880
 because a pony's smaller. Would you put Queen Elizabeth as the greatest leader of all time?

1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:16.640
 Probably. Yeah. I think as a woman and you look at the length of the rain,

1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:23.120
 I think it's like 70 something years or something like that. She reigned. Success, man. Success.

1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:29.040
 She used the church. She used public psychology, Shakespeare, the greatest playwright of all time

1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:35.840
 under her reign. You know, people were going to plays and it was a success front and she was

1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:43.280
 marauding everywhere else, marauding and culling resources for the empire. Just say absolute

1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:49.200
 successful. It's even a token of her success. We don't consider her a dictator. Yeah. She's a

1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:54.640
 dictator. You know, she was queen. This is my thing I love about the feudal system that these

1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:59.280
 fucking countries still have feudal systems. They're celebrating a horrible thing. Divine

1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:05.440
 right of kings, oppression. Kings were dictators and now they have fucking ceremonial. Why don't

1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:10.080
 we have a ceremonial furor? What is in German? He doesn't do any of the bad stuff. He just rolls

1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:14.480
 around and does this shit. I mean, it's like, what the fuck? There's no difference between a

1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:19.200
 Hitler and a fucking king. They did the same horrible shit. Why not a fucking ceremonial

1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:22.800
 conqueror? Alexander the Great walks in, rapes it a little bit, but it's all fun. It's for

1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:30.160
 ceremony. He represents the country. Macedonia is great. It's interesting to see that some

1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:36.560
 you're starting to see a bit of that in Russia with Stalin, actually, the celebration of a man

1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:42.560
 that helped win the great patriotic war. Uh oh. Yeah. Right. So like you you're already starting

1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:47.120
 to see that is very possible in history books. You'll be seen as maybe like a Jengis Khan type

1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:53.360
 of character and you forget the millions that he tortured. So you're one of the most successful

1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:58.640
 and brilliant people the world has ever seen. So you're the good person to ask for advice.

1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:04.960
 You know, there's a lot of young people that look up to you. God bless their souls and hearts.

1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:09.920
 Made the right choice. What advice would you give to a young person, maybe to yourself,

1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:15.200
 to a young version of yourself, you know, and just how to live a successful, a good life?

1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:24.080
 Be doggedly you. I think the magic happens when you are stubbornly doggedly you and you

1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:29.920
 meet other people who are doing the same. And the real magic of life, the real true currency in

1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:36.880
 this ephemeral life is sort of the communication that happens between people. That's the real

1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:43.040
 currency, friendships, love. It's cliche, but it's I think the meaning of life is to experience,

1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:49.040
 to experience love. And I think people often mistake maybe it's because of Hollywood films

1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:56.240
 and things like that, that love is feeling, but it's not. It's an action. So that took me a while

1:43:56.240 --> 1:44:00.320
 to learn. And I think that's why I've made decisions since that I think have been good for me and

1:44:00.320 --> 1:44:07.120
 healthy for me. Love is an action. People can say things, you can feel things. That doesn't mean

1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:13.040
 they're necessarily real. It's all chemical reactions. It's all tied to our immaturity

1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:21.840
 and psychological issues and survival. But action when you do things, when you act out of love,

1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:31.120
 and that's what it's about. Is there times when you were younger where you were dishonest with

1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:37.280
 who you are to yourself? Yeah. In terms of what kind of things did you have to do to shake yourself

1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:43.600
 up and be like, okay, I thought I'm going to be a scientist, but instead I realized I'm going to do

1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:48.560
 this. Yeah, my parents want it. I'm going to make funny. Yeah, my comedy is a hard thing to explain

1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:54.560
 to an immigrant mother who came here and under Nazi occupied Crete and became a human rights

1:44:54.560 --> 1:44:59.760
 lawyer and lawyer. And my brother's a lawyer. My father was a lawyer. Claude is way up. His dad

1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:05.600
 was a... So you're a disappointment. I'm the black sheep. Yeah, my brother went to Oxford,

1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:14.720
 Georgetown Law at Brown. He has master's and law degrees. My mother has four law degrees.

1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:19.760
 She was on the Human Rights Commission in New York up for a judgeship under Dinkins,

1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:26.240
 wrote a... She was the editor of Unitar. She wrote a seminal piece on the human rights of

1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:32.240
 children for the United Nations. And yeah, I was a comedian. I was always a fuck up. And the thing

1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:37.200
 that I was best at, the only thing I was ever decent at was just making people laugh. I don't

1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:41.920
 know why. I don't know where that comes from. Was there ever a question or was there a moment

1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:45.840
 where you decided this is what I'm going to do? There was a moment after I graduated college.

1:45:45.840 --> 1:45:51.280
 Yeah, but I was thinking about all types of stuff that other people imposed on me. And

1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:56.000
 I was honest with myself. And once I figured out it was an actual career path, I wasn't even aware.

1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:01.040
 Back then the internet wasn't huge. You know, in late 99, 2000, it wasn't big yet. So I didn't

1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:04.720
 even... I thought Robin Williams was just like an actor. I didn't know there was comedy clubs and all.

1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:10.080
 So once I learned that, I was just like, I tried it. I suffered from massive anxiety. I remember

1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:14.400
 the first time I did comedy, my arms went numb. I started having a massive panic attack. I have

1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:18.400
 my first set. I can show it to you. It's like, I suggest I just... I'm video. Yeah, I'm video.

1:46:18.400 --> 1:46:21.600
 Oh, nice. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the reason why I kept saying thank you is because

1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:25.840
 I forgot my whole jokes. I was so scared. And then they laughed because of the amount of times I said

1:46:25.840 --> 1:46:31.040
 thank you. And then once they laughed, I remembered the whole thing. And I did the five minutes.

1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:35.200
 And I remember getting off and for a person who never felt like he had a place anywhere,

1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:40.960
 nothing ever felt right. That felt like, okay, I found it. This is what I'm supposed to do.

1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:44.960
 This is it. It was the only time in my life I felt that I haven't felt it since,

1:46:44.960 --> 1:46:48.560
 never felt it before. So it's the only thing I can do. And...

1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:53.520
 Yeah, I had that. You know, it's funny because there's... I have a similar experience like immigrant

1:46:53.520 --> 1:46:59.600
 family in the world tells you to do certain things and you think that's right. But then

1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:08.320
 you put yourself in situations by luck, probably, where it's like, oh, this feels right. I don't

1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:13.680
 know what this means, but this feels right. I think the biggest moment like that for me was...

1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:20.240
 I don't know what to make of it exactly, but when I met Spot, the robot, the legged robot,

1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:28.720
 it was like five years ago, it felt like the depth of fascinating ideas that are yet to be

1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:33.440
 explored with this thing. This felt like a journey. It was like a door that opened.

1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:39.600
 I was like, I don't want to be a professor. At that point, I realized I don't want to

1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:46.400
 do sort of generic stuff. I want to do something crazy. I want to do something big.

1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:50.960
 That's the reason I stepped away from MIT. That's the reason I have this burning desire to do a

1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:55.760
 startup. That's the reason I came to Austin. Yeah, I don't know what the hell it all means,

1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:59.440
 but you just follow that. That's awesome. That sounds like you're following what's

1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:06.960
 doggedly you. Also, I think just to piggyback off it, I think that means no matter what it is,

1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:13.280
 because I think the American dream is sold like, hey, if you're not Beyoncé or if you're not famous,

1:48:13.280 --> 1:48:16.880
 you're not worth it. I hate that. That's what I love so much about certain countries like

1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:21.440
 Sweden. It's like where everyone has healthcare and stuff like that, because everyone's a little

1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:26.720
 is valued more. It's like whatever, if you want to be a doorman, dude, it's all the same. Prince

1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:33.040
 was not happy. Just because you're rich or famous, you're still the same guy, whether your possessions

1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:40.000
 are a lot little. It's like, I have met some doormen. I have met some tax gapers that a lot of you

1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:47.280
 not are more fascinating. Comedians are horrible people. I want to get away from all, but I have

1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:52.720
 very few friends, Paul Verzi, Tim Dillon, who are comedians because they're awful, awful people.

1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:58.640
 Some of the people who you know the most, who are the most famous, are not who they say they are.

1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:03.280
 Usually that's the case. They're putting on that public facade because they're fucking sociopaths.

1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:07.520
 They're horrible people. And some of the most beautiful people I've met and the most interesting

1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:14.000
 people I've met have regular jobs. There is no shame in any fucking job. We don't all have to be

1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:20.560
 rappers with rims. It's just a weird thing. Yeah, fame is a drug. And yeah, comedians,

1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:26.960
 I agree with you. There's some part of me that knows that there'll be a moment in my life when

1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:34.400
 I'm standing there with a sword or a knife in my stomach and looking at Tim Dillon's smiling face

1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:44.800
 saying, you shouldn't have trusted me. You stupid fuck. So on that note, Yannis, I've been a huge

1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:51.360
 fan of yours. I love what you're doing with long days now, your new podcast. And I obviously love

1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:55.760
 all the stuff you've done before with history, hyenas, the chemistry, the chemistry you have

1:49:55.760 --> 1:50:00.080
 with yourself is also fun to watch. So man, I'm a huge fan. It's a huge honor that you come down

1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:03.520
 here. Thanks so much for talking to me. It means so much to me to hear you say that. I really

1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:07.200
 appreciate I'm a big fan of yours. And have me on has been amazing. And just thank you, man.

1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:11.040
