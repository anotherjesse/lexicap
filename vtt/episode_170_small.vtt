00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
 The following is a conversation with Ronald Sullivan, a professor at Harvard Law School

00:04.640 --> 00:08.520
 known for taking on difficult and controversial cases.

00:08.520 --> 00:14.120
 He was on the head legal defense team for the Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez

00:14.120 --> 00:16.020
 in his double murder case.

00:16.020 --> 00:21.800
 He represented one of the Gina VI defendants and never lost the case during his years in

00:21.800 --> 00:25.920
 Washington, D.C.'s Public Defender Services Office.

00:25.920 --> 00:32.280
 In 2019, Ronald joined the legal defense team of Harvey Weinstein, a film producer

00:32.280 --> 00:36.480
 facing multiple charges of rape and other sexual assault.

00:36.480 --> 00:41.880
 This decision met with criticism from Harvard University students, including an online petition

00:41.880 --> 00:46.880
 by students seeking his removal as faculty dean of Winthrop House.

00:46.880 --> 00:52.320
 Then, a letter supporting him signed by 52 Harvard Law School professors appeared in

00:52.320 --> 00:56.160
 the Boston Globe on March 8, 2019.

00:56.160 --> 00:59.640
 Following this, the Harvard administration succumbed to the pressure of a few Harvard

00:59.640 --> 01:05.760
 students and announced that they will not be renewing Ronald Sullivan's dean position.

01:05.760 --> 01:11.840
 This created a major backlash in the public discourse over the necessary role of universities

01:11.840 --> 01:19.260
 in upholding the principles of law and freedom at the very foundation of the United States.

01:19.260 --> 01:24.200

01:31.480 --> 01:37.480
 As a side note, let me say that the free exchange of difficult ideas is the only mechanism through

01:37.480 --> 01:39.800
 which we can make progress.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.600
 Truth is not a safe space.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.560
 Truth is humbling, and being humbled can hurt.

01:46.560 --> 01:52.920
 But this is the role of education, not just in the university but in business and in life.

01:52.920 --> 01:58.560
 Freedom and compassion can coexist, but it requires work and patience.

01:58.560 --> 02:04.120
 It requires listening to the voices and to the experiences unlike our own.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.720
 Listening, not silencing.

02:06.720 --> 02:14.160
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Ronald Sullivan.

02:14.160 --> 02:20.200
 You were one of the lawyers who represented the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in

02:20.200 --> 02:22.440
 advance of a sexual assault trial.

02:22.440 --> 02:27.800
 For this, Harvard forced you to step down as faculty deans, you and your wife, of Winter

02:27.800 --> 02:28.800
 Pulse.

02:28.800 --> 02:35.240
 Can you tell the story of this saga from first deciding to represent Harvey Weinstein to

02:35.240 --> 02:38.880
 the interesting complicated events that followed?

02:38.880 --> 02:45.000
 Yeah, sure, so I got a call one morning from a colleague at the Harvard Law School who

02:45.000 --> 02:52.640
 asked if I would consent to taking a call from Harvey.

02:52.640 --> 02:56.600
 He wanted to meet me and chat with me about representing him.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.640
 I said, yes, and one thing led to another.

03:00.640 --> 03:08.360
 I drove out to Connecticut where he was staying and met with him and some of his advisors and

03:08.360 --> 03:13.280
 then a day or two later decided to take the case.

03:13.280 --> 03:19.000
 This would have been back in January of 2019, I believe.

03:19.000 --> 03:27.320
 So the sort of cases, I have a very small practice, most of my time is teaching and writing,

03:27.320 --> 03:33.040
 but I tend to take cases that most deem to be impossible.

03:33.040 --> 03:37.320
 I take the challenging sorts of cases.

03:37.320 --> 03:45.800
 When this was fit the bill, it was quite challenging in the sense that everyone had prejudged the

03:45.800 --> 03:46.800
 case.

03:46.800 --> 03:52.640
 When I say everyone, I just mean the general sentiment and the public had the case prejudged.

03:52.640 --> 04:02.520
 Even though the specific allegations did not regard any of the people in the New Yorker,

04:02.520 --> 04:11.440
 the New Yorker article that sort of exposed everything that was going on allegedly with

04:11.440 --> 04:12.440
 Harvey.

04:12.440 --> 04:17.160
 So I decided to take the case and I did.

04:17.160 --> 04:22.360
 Is there a philosophy behind you taking on these very difficult cases?

04:22.360 --> 04:23.360
 Is it a set of principles?

04:23.360 --> 04:29.760
 Is it just your love of the law or is there a set of principles why you take on the cases?

04:29.760 --> 04:38.120
 Yeah, I'd like to take on hard cases and I'd like to take on the cases that are with

04:38.120 --> 04:43.560
 unpopular defendants, unpopular clients.

04:43.560 --> 04:48.400
 And with respect to the latter, that's where Harvey Weinstein fell.

04:48.400 --> 04:58.320
 It's because we need lawyers and good lawyers to take the unpopular cases because those

04:58.320 --> 05:04.160
 sorts of cases determine what sort of criminal justice system we have.

05:04.160 --> 05:09.520
 If we don't protect the rights and the liberties of those whom the society deems to be the

05:09.520 --> 05:15.200
 least and the last, the unpopular client, then that's the camel's nose under the tent.

05:15.200 --> 05:19.720
 If we let the camel's nose under the tent, the entire tent is going to collapse.

05:19.720 --> 05:26.680
 That is to say, if we short circuit the rights of a client like Harvey Weinstein, then the

05:26.680 --> 05:31.560
 next thing you know, someone will be at your door, knocking it down and violating your

05:31.560 --> 05:32.560
 rights.

05:32.560 --> 05:38.960
 There's a certain creep there with respect to the way in which the state will respect

05:38.960 --> 05:41.640
 the civil rights and civil liberties of people.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.360
 And these are the sorts of cases that test it.

05:44.360 --> 05:52.160
 So for example, there was a young man many, many years ago named Ernesto Miranda.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.240
 By all accounts, he was not a likable guy.

05:55.240 --> 06:03.800
 He was a three time knife thief and not a likable guy, but lawyer stepped up and took

06:03.800 --> 06:04.800
 his case.

06:04.800 --> 06:10.280
 And because of that, we now have the Miranda warnings, you have the right to remain silent,

06:10.280 --> 06:15.480
 those warnings that officers are forced to give to people.

06:15.480 --> 06:21.440
 So it is through these cases that we express oftentimes the best values in our criminal

06:21.440 --> 06:22.440
 justice system.

06:22.440 --> 06:28.400
 And I proudly take on these sorts of cases in order to vindicate not only the individual

06:28.400 --> 06:36.160
 rights of the person whom I'm representing, but the rights of citizens writ large, most

06:36.160 --> 06:40.000
 of whom do not experience the criminal justice system.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.600
 And it's partly because of lawyers who take on these sorts of cases and establish rules

06:47.600 --> 06:53.160
 that protect us, average everyday ordinary concrete citizens.

06:53.160 --> 06:58.640
 As from a psychological perspective, just you as a human, is there fear?

06:58.640 --> 07:00.720
 Is there stress from all the pressure?

07:00.720 --> 07:04.800
 Because if you're facing, I mean, the whole point, a difficult case, especially in the

07:04.800 --> 07:10.600
 latter that you mentioned of the going against popular opinion, you have the eyes of millions

07:10.600 --> 07:19.240
 potentially looking at you with anger as you try to defend this set of laws that this country

07:19.240 --> 07:20.240
 is built on.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.200
 No, it doesn't stress me out particularly.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.360
 It sort of comes with the territory.

07:26.360 --> 07:31.640
 I try not to get too excited in either direction.

07:31.640 --> 07:35.680
 So a big part of my practice is wrongful convictions.

07:35.680 --> 07:43.360
 And I have gotten over 6,000 people out of prison who've been wrongfully incarcerated

07:43.360 --> 07:50.440
 and a subset of those people have been convicted and if people have been in jail 20, 30 years

07:50.440 --> 07:51.440
 who have gotten out.

07:51.440 --> 07:57.160
 And those are the sorts of cases where people praise you and that sort of thing.

07:57.160 --> 08:04.080
 And so, look, I do the work that I do, I'm proud of the work that I do.

08:04.080 --> 08:10.220
 And in that sense, I'm sort of a part time Taoist, the expression reversal was the movement

08:10.220 --> 08:11.720
 of the Tao.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.520
 So I don't get too high, I don't get too low.

08:14.520 --> 08:18.640
 I just try to do my work and represent people to the best of my ability.

08:18.640 --> 08:23.040
 So one of the hardest cases of recent history would be the Harvey Weinstein in terms of

08:23.040 --> 08:25.720
 popular opinion or unpopular opinion.

08:25.720 --> 08:31.960
 So if you continue on that line, what was that, where does that story take you of taking

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
 on this case?

08:32.960 --> 08:33.960
 Yeah.

08:33.960 --> 08:40.160
 I took on the case and then there was some a few students at the college.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.160
 So let me back up.

08:41.160 --> 08:45.800
 I had an administrative post at Harvard College, which is a separate entity from the Harvard

08:45.800 --> 08:46.800
 Law School.

08:46.800 --> 08:51.040
 Harvard College is the undergraduate portion of Harvard University and the law school

08:51.040 --> 08:53.640
 is obviously the law school.

08:53.640 --> 08:58.800
 And I initially was appointed as master of one of the houses.

08:58.800 --> 09:04.800
 We did a name change five or six years into it and we're called faculty deans.

09:04.800 --> 09:09.520
 But the houses at Harvard are based on the college system of Oxford and Cambridge.

09:09.520 --> 09:15.040
 So when students go to Harvard after their first year, they're assigned to a particular

09:15.040 --> 09:18.920
 house or college and that's where they live and eat and so forth.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.280
 And these are undergraduates too.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.720
 These are undergraduate students.

09:21.720 --> 09:28.120
 So I was responsible for one of the houses as its faculty dean.

09:28.120 --> 09:34.200
 So it's an administrative appointment at the college and some students who didn't clearly

09:34.200 --> 09:42.120
 didn't like Harvey Weinstein began to protest about the representation.

09:42.120 --> 09:52.040
 And from there, it just mushroomed into one of the most craven cowardly acts by any university

09:52.040 --> 09:53.320
 in modern history.

09:53.320 --> 10:00.400
 It's just a complete and utter repudiation of academic freedom.

10:00.400 --> 10:07.040
 And it is a decision that Harvard certainly will live to regret.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.320
 It's frankly, it's an embarrassment.

10:09.320 --> 10:16.040
 We expect students to do what students do and I encourage students to have their voices

10:16.040 --> 10:17.440
 heard and to protest.

10:17.440 --> 10:20.040
 I mean, that's what students do.

10:20.040 --> 10:24.360
 What is vexing are the adults.

10:24.360 --> 10:31.040
 The dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Claudine Gaye, absolutely craven and cowardly.

10:31.040 --> 10:37.160
 The dean of the college, same thing, Rakesh Karana, craven and cowardly.

10:37.160 --> 10:45.040
 They capitulated to the loudest voice in the room and ran around afraid of 19 year olds.

10:45.040 --> 10:50.000
 Oh, 19 year olds are upset that I need to do something.

10:50.000 --> 10:58.080
 And it appeared to me that they so, so desired the approval of students that they were afraid

10:58.080 --> 11:01.560
 to make the tough decision and the right decision.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.400
 It really could have been an important teaching moment at Harvard.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.400
 A teaching moment, yeah.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.880
 Very important teaching moment.

11:07.880 --> 11:13.200
 So they forced you to step down from that faculty dean position at the house.

11:13.200 --> 11:21.560
 I would push back on the description a little bit, so I don't write the references to the

11:21.560 --> 11:26.800
 op ad I did in the New York time, Harvard made a mistake by making me step down or something

11:26.800 --> 11:27.800
 like that.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.280
 So I don't write those things.

11:29.280 --> 11:33.160
 I did not step down and refuse to step down.

11:33.160 --> 11:41.080
 Harvard declined to renew my contract and I made it clear that I was not going to resign

11:41.080 --> 11:50.280
 as a matter of principle and force them to do the cowardly act that they, in fact, did.

11:50.280 --> 11:59.040
 And you know, the worst thing about this, they did the college Dean Gay and Dean Carana

11:59.040 --> 12:01.040
 commission this survey.

12:01.040 --> 12:05.360
 They've never done this before, surveyed from the students, you know, how do you feel at

12:05.360 --> 12:06.360
 Winthrop House?

12:06.360 --> 12:07.360
 Yeah.

12:07.360 --> 12:11.040
 And the funny thing about the survey is they never released the results.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.440
 Why did they never release the results?

12:13.440 --> 12:20.160
 They never released the results because I would bet my salary that the results came

12:20.160 --> 12:24.920
 back positive for me and it didn't fit their narrative because most of the students were

12:24.920 --> 12:25.920
 fine.

12:25.920 --> 12:26.920
 Yes.

12:26.920 --> 12:27.920
 Most of the students were fine.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.520
 It was the loudest voice in the room.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.920
 So they never released it.

12:30.920 --> 12:35.040
 And you know, I challenged them to this day, release it, release it.

12:35.040 --> 12:46.120
 But no, but you know, they wanted to create this narrative and when the data didn't support

12:46.120 --> 12:48.880
 the narrative, then they just got silent.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.920
 Oh, we're not going to release it.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.440
 The students demanded it.

12:52.440 --> 12:59.720
 I demanded it and they wouldn't release it because I am, I just know in my heart of hearts

12:59.720 --> 13:06.560
 that it was, it came back in my favor that most students at Winthrop House said they

13:06.560 --> 13:07.560
 were fine.

13:07.560 --> 13:12.600
 There was a group of students that weaponized the term unsafe.

13:12.600 --> 13:19.800
 They said we felt unsafe and they bantied this term about.

13:19.800 --> 13:25.000
 But I am, again, I'm confident that the majority of students at Winthrop House said they felt

13:25.000 --> 13:29.400
 completely fine and felt safe and so forth.

13:29.400 --> 13:35.960
 And the super majority, I am confident, either said I feel great at Winthrop or, you know,

13:35.960 --> 13:37.640
 I don't care one way or the other.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.880
 And then there was some minority who had had a different view.

13:40.880 --> 13:47.200
 But you know, lessons learned.

13:47.200 --> 13:53.400
 It was a wonderful opportunity at Winthrop, I met some amazing students over my 10 years

13:53.400 --> 13:59.080
 as master and then faculty dean and I'm still in touch with a number of students, some of

13:59.080 --> 14:02.800
 whom are now my students at the law school.

14:02.800 --> 14:10.000
 So in the end, I thought it was, it ended up being a great experience.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.200
 The national media was just wonderful in this, just wonderful.

14:15.200 --> 14:24.640
 People wrote such wonderful articles and accounts and wagged their finger appropriately at Harvard.

14:24.640 --> 14:29.640
 They wrote me to John Adams, which I don't think is an apt comparison, but it's always

14:29.640 --> 14:31.640
 great to read something like that.

14:31.640 --> 14:37.520
 But anyway, that was the Harvard versus Harvey situation.

14:37.520 --> 14:42.520
 So that seems like a seminal mistake by Harvard and Harvard is one of the great universities

14:42.520 --> 14:44.120
 in the world.

14:44.120 --> 14:50.480
 And so sort of its successes and its mistakes are really important for the world as a beacon

14:50.480 --> 14:53.480
 of like how we make progress.

14:53.480 --> 15:01.520
 So what lessons for the bigger academia that's under fire a lot these days, what bigger lessons

15:01.520 --> 15:03.800
 do you take away?

15:03.800 --> 15:06.520
 How do we make Harvard great?

15:06.520 --> 15:12.600
 How do we make other universities Yale, MIT great in the face of such mistakes?

15:12.600 --> 15:24.080
 Well, I think that we have moved into a model where we have the consumerization of education.

15:24.080 --> 15:35.160
 That is to say, we have feckless administrators who make policy based on what the students

15:35.160 --> 15:37.280
 say.

15:37.280 --> 15:44.320
 Now this comment is not intended to suggest that students have no voice in governance,

15:44.320 --> 15:48.440
 but it is to suggest that the faculty are there for a reason.

15:48.440 --> 15:53.960
 They are among the greatest minds on the planet Earth in their particular fields at schools

15:53.960 --> 15:59.840
 like Harvard and Yale, Stanford, the schools that you mentioned, MIT, quite literally the

15:59.840 --> 16:01.400
 greatest minds on Earth.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.160
 They are there for a reason.

16:04.160 --> 16:11.440
 Students like curriculum and so forth are rightly in the province of faculty.

16:11.440 --> 16:18.400
 And while you take input and critique and so forth, ultimately the grownups in the room

16:18.400 --> 16:27.720
 have to be sufficiently responsible to take charge and to direct the course of a student's

16:27.720 --> 16:28.720
 education.

16:28.720 --> 16:35.920
 And my situation is one example where it really could have been an excellent teaching moment

16:35.920 --> 16:44.080
 about the value of the Sixth Amendment, about what it means to treat people who are in the

16:44.080 --> 16:46.720
 crosshairs of the criminal justice system.

16:46.720 --> 16:54.640
 But rather than having that conversation, it's just this consumerization model.

16:54.640 --> 17:00.680
 Well, there's a lot of noise out here, so we're going to react in this sort of way.

17:00.680 --> 17:07.160
 Higher education as well, unfortunately, has been commodified in other sorts of ways that

17:07.160 --> 17:17.960
 has reduced or impeded, hampered these schools commitments to free and robust and open dialogue.

17:17.960 --> 17:23.960
 So to the degree that academic freedom doesn't sit squarely at the center of the academic

17:23.960 --> 17:27.400
 mission, any school is going to be in trouble.

17:27.400 --> 17:42.760
 And I really hope that we weather this current political moment where 19 year olds without

17:42.760 --> 17:54.000
 degrees are running universities and get back to a system where faculty, where adults make

17:54.000 --> 17:59.080
 decisions in the best interests of the university and the best interests of the students, even

17:59.080 --> 18:05.320
 to the degree though some of those decisions may be unpopular.

18:05.320 --> 18:18.520
 And that is going to require a certain courage and hopefully in time, and I'm confident that

18:18.520 --> 18:25.080
 in time administrators are going to begin to push back on these current trends.

18:25.080 --> 18:29.360
 Harvard's been around for a long time, it's been around for a long time for a reason.

18:29.360 --> 18:34.000
 And one of the reasons is that it understands itself not to be static.

18:34.000 --> 18:49.760
 So I have every view that Harvard is going to adapt and get itself back on course and

18:49.760 --> 18:53.200
 be around another 400 years, at least that's my hope.

18:53.200 --> 18:58.480
 So I mean, what this kind of boils down to is just having difficult conversation, difficult

18:58.480 --> 18:59.480
 debates.

18:59.480 --> 19:04.840
 When you mentioned sort of 19 year olds, and it's funny, I've seen this even at MIT, it's

19:04.840 --> 19:12.040
 not that they shouldn't have a voice, they do seem to, I guess you have to experience

19:12.040 --> 19:13.880
 it and just observe it.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.960
 They have a strangely disproportionate power.

19:17.960 --> 19:22.960
 It's very interesting to basically, I mean, you say yes, there's great faculty and so

19:22.960 --> 19:30.800
 on, but it's not even just that the faculty is smart or wise or whatever, it's that they're

19:30.800 --> 19:33.200
 just silenced.

19:33.200 --> 19:40.040
 So the terminology that you mentioned is weaponized as sort of safe spaces or that certain conversations

19:40.040 --> 19:43.440
 make people feel unsafe.

19:43.440 --> 19:48.560
 What do you think about this kind of idea?

19:48.560 --> 19:55.520
 Is there some things that are unsafe to talk about in the university setting?

19:55.520 --> 19:58.560
 Is there lines to be drawn somewhere?

19:58.560 --> 20:03.920
 And just like you said on the flip side with the slippery slope, is it too easy for the

20:03.920 --> 20:06.000
 lines to be drawn everywhere?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.460
 Yeah, that's a great question.

20:08.460 --> 20:16.200
 So this idea of unsafe space, at least the vocabulary derives from some research, academic

20:16.200 --> 20:21.840
 research about feeling psychologically unsafe.

20:21.840 --> 20:32.520
 And so the notion here is that there are forms of psychological disquiet that impedes people

20:32.520 --> 20:39.320
 from experiencing the educational environment to the greatest degree possible.

20:39.320 --> 20:44.680
 And that's the argument.

20:44.680 --> 20:53.800
 And assuming for a moment that people do have these feelings of disquiet at elite universities

20:53.800 --> 20:59.880
 like MIT and like Harvard, that's probably the safest space people are going to be in

20:59.880 --> 21:06.800
 for their lives because when they get out into the quote unquote real world, they won't

21:06.800 --> 21:14.320
 have the sorts of nets that these schools provide, safety nets that these schools provide.

21:14.320 --> 21:20.480
 So to the extent that research is descriptive of a psychological feeling, I think that the

21:20.480 --> 21:23.920
 duty of the universities are to challenge people.

21:23.920 --> 21:29.480
 It seems to me that it's a shame to go to a place like Harvard or a place like MIT, Yale,

21:29.480 --> 21:35.880
 any of these great institutions and come out the same person that you were when you went

21:35.880 --> 21:37.120
 in.

21:37.120 --> 21:42.200
 That seems to be a horrible waste of four years and money and resources.

21:42.200 --> 21:50.200
 However, we ought to challenge students, that they grow, challenge some of their most deeply

21:50.200 --> 21:53.200
 held assumptions.

21:53.200 --> 22:00.240
 They may continue to hold them, but the point of an education is to rigorously interrogate

22:00.240 --> 22:08.400
 these fundamental assumptions that have guided you thus far and to do it fairly and civilly.

22:08.400 --> 22:13.480
 So to the extent that there are lines that should be drawn, there's a long tradition

22:13.480 --> 22:15.760
 in the University of Civil Discourse.

22:15.760 --> 22:22.240
 So you should draw lines somewhere between civil discourse and uncivil discourse.

22:22.240 --> 22:29.800
 The purpose of a university is to talk difficult conversations, tough issues, talk directly

22:29.800 --> 22:33.160
 and frankly, but do it civilly.

22:33.160 --> 22:42.240
 And so to yell and cuss at somebody and that sort of thing, well, do that on your own space,

22:42.240 --> 22:47.840
 but observe the norms of civil discourse at the university.

22:47.840 --> 22:57.840
 So look, I think that the presumption ought to be that the most difficult topics are appropriate

22:57.840 --> 23:00.080
 to talk about at a university.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.800
 That ought to be the presumption.

23:01.800 --> 23:14.880
 Now, you know, should MIT, for example, give its imprimatur to someone who is espousing

23:14.880 --> 23:18.520
 the flat earth theory, you know, the earth is flat, right?

23:18.520 --> 23:33.920
 So if certain ideas are so contrary to the scientific and cultural thinking of the moment,

23:33.920 --> 23:39.920
 yeah, there's space there to draw a line and say, yeah, we're not going to give you this

23:39.920 --> 23:45.920
 platform to tell our students that the earth is flat.

23:45.920 --> 23:52.720
 But you know, it's a topic that's controversial, but contestatory.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.440
 That's what universities are for.

23:54.440 --> 23:58.920
 If you don't like the idea, present better ideas and articulate them.

23:58.920 --> 24:04.200
 And I think there needs to be a mechanism outside of the space of ideas of humbling.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.080
 Like I've done martial arts for a long time.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.960
 I got my ass kicked a lot.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.720
 I think that's really important.

24:10.720 --> 24:18.120
 I mean, in the space of ideas, I mean, even just in engineering, just all the math classes,

24:18.120 --> 24:25.040
 my memories of math, which I love, it's kind of pain.

24:25.040 --> 24:31.480
 It's basically coming face to face with the idea that I'm not special, that I'm much

24:31.480 --> 24:38.800
 dumber than I thought I was, and that anything, accomplishing anything in this world requires

24:38.800 --> 24:40.300
 really hard work.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.480
 That's really humbling.

24:42.480 --> 24:47.680
 That puts you, because I remember when I was 18 and 19, and I thought I was going to be

24:47.680 --> 24:53.600
 the smartest, the best fighter, the Nobel Prize winning, you know, all those kinds of

24:53.600 --> 24:54.600
 things.

24:54.600 --> 24:58.800
 And then you come face to face with reality and it hurts.

24:58.800 --> 25:02.960
 And it feels like there needs to be efficient mechanisms from the best universities in the

25:02.960 --> 25:11.400
 world to, without abusing you, it's a very difficult line to walk without like mentally

25:11.400 --> 25:15.680
 or physically abusing you, be able to humble you.

25:15.680 --> 25:20.000
 And that's what I felt was missing in these very difficult, very important conversations

25:20.000 --> 25:28.000
 is the 19 year olds, when they spoke up, the mechanism for humbling them with ideas was

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
 missing.

25:29.000 --> 25:39.520
 I kind of got broken down because, as you say, there does, like, I sensed fear.

25:39.520 --> 25:45.760
 Everything was permeated with fear, and fear is paralyzing, fear is destructive, especially

25:45.760 --> 25:50.520
 in a place that's supposed to be all about freedom of ideas.

25:50.520 --> 25:55.960
 And I mean, I don't know if you have anything, any thoughts to say on this whole idea of

25:55.960 --> 26:03.640
 cancel culture, where people, a lot of people usually become political, so staying maybe

26:03.640 --> 26:07.040
 outside of the world to politics.

26:07.040 --> 26:12.640
 Is this, Jeff, do you have thoughts about it, does it bother you that people are sort

26:12.640 --> 26:18.720
 of put in this bin and labeled as something and then thereby you can ignore everything

26:18.720 --> 26:19.720
 they say?

26:19.720 --> 26:24.640
 I mean, Stephen Pinker, there's a lot of Harvard folks that are fighting against these

26:24.640 --> 26:27.320
 set of ideas, but do you have thoughts?

26:27.320 --> 26:36.800
 I think that we, as a culture, are way, way, way too quick to cancel people, and it's become

26:36.800 --> 26:47.240
 almost reflexive now, you know, someone say something or makes an offhand comment, even

26:47.240 --> 26:54.120
 a mistake, there's a move to simply cancel folks.

26:54.120 --> 27:02.920
 So I think that this quote, unquote, cancel culture has really gotten out of control at

27:02.920 --> 27:04.320
 this point.

27:04.320 --> 27:09.080
 It's forcing people to be robotic in many ways.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.560
 No offense, the robots.

27:10.560 --> 27:15.720
 I was gonna say, now I know I'm venturing into your intellectual domain.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.840
 For future robots watching us, no offense.

27:18.840 --> 27:24.400
 And there are many, and it's discouraging a lot of good people from getting into public

27:24.400 --> 27:30.000
 life in any sort of way because, you know, who needs the, who needs the stress of it?

27:30.000 --> 27:35.720
 Well, in some sense, you're an inspiration that you're able to withstand the pressure,

27:35.720 --> 27:37.440
 the pressure of the masses.

27:37.440 --> 27:43.000
 But it is, it's a sad, it's a sad aspect of human nature that we kind of get into these

27:43.000 --> 27:48.160
 crowds and we get, we start chanting and it's fun for some reason, and then you forget yourself

27:48.160 --> 27:55.400
 and then you sort of wake up the next day not, not having anticipated the consequences

27:55.400 --> 27:58.920
 of all the chanting and we would get ourselves in trouble in that.

27:58.920 --> 28:06.000
 I mean, there's some responsibility on the, on social networks and the mechanisms by which

28:06.000 --> 28:10.400
 they make it more frictionless to do the chanting, to do the canceling, to do the outrage and

28:10.400 --> 28:11.400
 all that kind of stuff.

28:11.400 --> 28:16.800
 So I actually on the technology side have a hope that that's fixable, but yeah, it does

28:16.800 --> 28:25.520
 seem to be, you know, it almost like the internet showed to us that we have a lot of broken

28:25.520 --> 28:29.360
 ways about which we communicate with each other and we're trying to figure that out.

28:29.360 --> 28:35.600
 Same with the university, the, this mistake by Harvard showed that we need to reinvent

28:35.600 --> 28:41.000
 what the university is and I mean, all of this is, it's almost like we're finding our

28:41.000 --> 28:47.080
 baby dear likes and trying to strengthen the institutions that have been very successful

28:47.080 --> 28:48.920
 for, for, for a long time.

28:48.920 --> 28:54.920
 You know, the really interesting thing about Harvey Weinstein and you choosing these exceptionally

28:54.920 --> 29:06.240
 difficult cases is also thinking about what it means to defend evil people, what it means

29:06.240 --> 29:13.600
 to defend these, we could say unpopular and you might push back against the word evil,

29:13.600 --> 29:16.840
 but bad people in society.

29:16.840 --> 29:20.000
 First of all, do you think there's such a thing as evil or do you think all people

29:20.000 --> 29:26.240
 are good and it's just circumstances that create evil and also is there somebody too

29:26.240 --> 29:29.040
 evil for the law to defend?

29:29.040 --> 29:33.840
 And so that's a, so the first question, that's a deep philosophical question, whether the

29:33.840 --> 29:40.000
 category of evil does any work for me, it does for me.

29:40.000 --> 29:49.400
 I do think that I do subscribe to that category that there is evil in the world as conventionally

29:49.400 --> 29:50.400
 understood.

29:50.400 --> 29:56.320
 So, so there are many who will say, yeah, that just doesn't, doesn't do any work for

29:56.320 --> 30:03.640
 me, but the category evil, in fact, does intellectual work for me and I understand

30:03.640 --> 30:07.560
 it as something that, that exists.

30:07.560 --> 30:13.480
 Is it genetic or is it the circumstance like, what kind of work does it do for you intellectually?

30:13.480 --> 30:21.560
 I think that it's tightly contingent, that is to say that the conditions in which one

30:21.560 --> 30:32.560
 grows up and so forth, begins to create this category that we may think of as evil.

30:32.560 --> 30:42.000
 Now there are studies and whatnot that show that certain brain abnormalities and so forth

30:42.000 --> 30:45.560
 are more prevalent in say, serial killer.

30:45.560 --> 30:53.840
 So there may be a biological predisposition to certain forms of conduct, but I don't,

30:53.840 --> 31:02.400
 I don't have the biological evidence to make a statement that someone is born evil in and

31:02.400 --> 31:07.000
 you know, I'm not a determinist thinker in that way.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.480
 So you come out the womb evil and you're destined to be that way.

31:11.480 --> 31:22.080
 To the extent there may be biological determinants, there still require some nurture as well.

31:22.080 --> 31:26.400
 So but do you still put a responsibility for the, on the individual?

31:26.400 --> 31:27.400
 Of course.

31:27.400 --> 31:28.400
 Yeah.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.400
 We all make choices.

31:29.400 --> 31:36.800
 And so some responsibility on the individual indeed.

31:36.800 --> 31:45.320
 We live in a culture, unfortunately, where a lot of people have a constellation of bad

31:45.320 --> 31:46.840
 choices in front of them.

31:46.840 --> 31:54.800
 And that makes me very sad that the people grow up with predominantly bad choices in

31:54.800 --> 31:55.800
 front of them.

31:55.800 --> 31:56.800
 And that's unfair.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.760
 And that's, that's on all of us.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.960
 But yes, I do think we make, we make choices.

32:00.960 --> 32:01.960
 Wow.

32:01.960 --> 32:02.960
 That's so powerful.

32:02.960 --> 32:08.120
 The constellation of bad choices.

32:08.120 --> 32:17.480
 That's such a powerful way to think about sort of equality, which is the set of trajectories

32:17.480 --> 32:25.040
 before you that you could take if you just roll the dice is a, you know, life is a kind

32:25.040 --> 32:30.400
 of optimization problem, sorry to take us into math over a set of trajectories under

32:30.400 --> 32:33.400
 imperfect information.

32:33.400 --> 32:40.680
 So you're going to do a lot of stupid shit to put it in technical terms.

32:40.680 --> 32:48.120
 But the, the, the fraction of the trajectories that take you into, into bad places or into

32:48.120 --> 32:49.600
 good places is really important.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.920
 And that's ultimately what we're talking about.

32:51.920 --> 32:56.480
 Even evil might be just a little bit of a predisposition biologically, but the rest

32:56.480 --> 32:58.240
 is just trajectories that you can take.

32:58.240 --> 33:01.360
 I've been studying Hitler a lot recently.

33:01.360 --> 33:05.400
 I've been reading probably way too much and it's, it's interesting to think about all

33:05.400 --> 33:13.600
 the possible trajectories that could have avoided the, this particular individual developing

33:13.600 --> 33:21.480
 the hate that he did, the following that he did, the, the actual final, there's a few

33:21.480 --> 33:28.720
 turns in him psychologically where he went from being a leader that just wants to conquer

33:28.720 --> 33:37.840
 and to somebody who allowed his anger and emotion to take over to where he started making mistakes

33:37.840 --> 33:46.360
 for in terms of militarily speaking, but also started doing, you know, evil things.

33:46.360 --> 33:51.240
 And all the possible trajectories that could have avoided that are fascinating, including

33:51.240 --> 33:57.880
 he wasn't that bad at painting and drawing from the very beginning.

33:57.880 --> 34:02.440
 And, and it's time in Vienna, there's all these possible things to think about.

34:02.440 --> 34:06.280
 And of course, there's millions of others like him that never came to power and all

34:06.280 --> 34:07.880
 those kinds of things.

34:07.880 --> 34:12.640
 So, but that goes to the second question on the, on the side of evil.

34:12.640 --> 34:17.960
 Do you think, and, and Hitler's often brought up as like an example of somebody who is like

34:17.960 --> 34:20.400
 the epitome of evil.

34:20.400 --> 34:31.280
 Do you think you would, if you got that same phone call after World War II and Hitler survived

34:31.280 --> 34:39.680
 during war, you know, the trial for war crimes, would you take the case defending Adolf Hitler?

34:39.680 --> 34:45.320
 If you don't want to answer that one, is there a line to draw for evil for who to not to

34:45.320 --> 34:46.320
 defend?

34:46.320 --> 34:49.800
 No, I think, I think everyone, I'll do the second one first.

34:49.800 --> 34:54.960
 Everyone has a right to a defense if you're charged criminally in the United States of

34:54.960 --> 34:55.960
 America.

34:55.960 --> 35:03.320
 So, no, I do not think that there's someone so evil that they do not deserve a defense.

35:03.320 --> 35:05.400
 Process matters.

35:05.400 --> 35:11.800
 Process helps us get to results more accurately than we would otherwise.

35:11.800 --> 35:18.080
 So it is important and it's vitally important and indeed more important for someone deemed

35:18.080 --> 35:23.760
 to be evil to receive the same quantum of process and the same substance of process

35:23.760 --> 35:25.640
 that anyone else would.

35:25.640 --> 35:31.480
 It's vitally important to the health of our criminal justice system for that to happen.

35:31.480 --> 35:38.360
 So yes, everybody, Hitler included, were he charged in the United States for a crime that

35:38.360 --> 35:40.600
 occurred in the United States?

35:40.600 --> 35:41.600
 Yes.

35:41.600 --> 35:49.760
 Whether I would do it, if I were a public defender and assign the case, yes, I started

35:49.760 --> 35:51.680
 my career as a public defender.

35:51.680 --> 35:56.040
 I represent anyone who was assigned to me.

35:56.040 --> 35:59.360
 I think that is our duty.

35:59.360 --> 36:10.000
 In private practice, I have choices and I likely, based on the hypo you gave me, and

36:10.000 --> 36:15.400
 I would tweak it a bit because it would have to be a U.S. crime.

36:15.400 --> 36:19.080
 But I get the broader point and don't want to bog down in technicalities.

36:19.080 --> 36:30.080
 I'd likely pass right now as I see it unless it was a case where nobody else would represent

36:30.080 --> 36:31.080
 him.

36:31.080 --> 36:40.800
 Then I would think that I have some sort of duty and obligation to do it.

36:40.800 --> 36:46.040
 But yes, everyone absolutely deserves a right to competent counsel.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.560
 That is a beautiful idea.

36:48.560 --> 36:52.840
 It's difficult to think about it in the face of public pressure.

36:52.840 --> 37:00.280
 It's just, I mean, it's kind of terrifying to watch the masses during this past year

37:00.280 --> 37:08.400
 of 2020 to watch the power of the masses to make a decision before any of the data is

37:08.400 --> 37:17.520
 out, if the data is ever out, any of the details, any of the processes.

37:17.520 --> 37:20.560
 There's an anger to the justice system.

37:20.560 --> 37:25.280
 There's a lot of people that feel like, even though the ideal you describe is a beautiful

37:25.280 --> 37:29.760
 one, it does not always operate justly.

37:29.760 --> 37:33.160
 It does not operate to the best of its ideals.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.000
 It operates unfairly.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.160
 Can we go to the big picture of the criminal justice system?

37:39.160 --> 37:47.120
 What do you, given the ideal, works about our criminal justice system and what is broken?

37:47.120 --> 37:54.880
 Well, there's a lot broken right now and I usually focus on that.

37:54.880 --> 37:59.080
 But in truth, a lot works about our criminal justice system.

37:59.080 --> 38:07.920
 So there's an old joke and it's funny, but it carries a lot of truth to it.

38:07.920 --> 38:16.840
 And the joke is that in the United States, we have the worst criminal justice system

38:16.840 --> 38:22.000
 in the world except for every place else.

38:22.000 --> 38:29.040
 And yes, we certainly have a number of problems and a lot of problems based on race and class.

38:29.040 --> 38:36.160
 And economic station, but we have a process that privileges the liberty.

38:36.160 --> 38:40.400
 And that's a good feature of the criminal justice system.

38:40.400 --> 38:41.600
 So here's how it works.

38:41.600 --> 38:48.320
 The idea of the relationship between the individual and the state is such that in the United

38:48.320 --> 38:56.960
 States, we privilege liberty over and above very many values, so much so that a statement

38:56.960 --> 39:03.320
 by increased matter, not terribly far from where we're sitting right now, has gained

39:03.320 --> 39:08.800
 traction over all these years and it's that better, 10 guilty go free than one innocent

39:08.800 --> 39:10.840
 person convicted.

39:10.840 --> 39:18.480
 That is an expression of the way in which we understand liberty to operate in our collective

39:18.480 --> 39:19.480
 consciousness.

39:19.480 --> 39:28.240
 We would rather a bunch of guilty people go free than to impact the liberty interests

39:28.240 --> 39:30.880
 of any individual person.

39:30.880 --> 39:36.800
 So that's a guiding principle in our criminal justice system, liberty.

39:36.800 --> 39:42.860
 So we set a process that makes it difficult to convict people.

39:42.860 --> 39:51.120
 We have rules of procedure that are cumbersome and that slow down the process and that exclude

39:51.120 --> 39:58.280
 otherwise reliable evidence and this is all because we place a value on liberty and I

39:58.280 --> 40:04.640
 think these are good things and it says a lot about our criminal justice system.

40:04.640 --> 40:11.640
 Some of the bad features have to do with the way in which this country sees color as a

40:11.640 --> 40:18.600
 proxy for criminality and treats people of color in radically different ways in the criminal

40:18.600 --> 40:27.280
 justice system from arrests to charging decisions to sentencing.

40:27.280 --> 40:33.920
 People of color are disproportionately impacted on all sorts of registers.

40:33.920 --> 40:44.880
 One example and it's a popular one that although there appears to be no distinguishable difference

40:44.880 --> 40:54.240
 between drug use by whites and blacks in the country, blacks though only 12% of the population

40:54.240 --> 41:00.760
 represent 40% of the drug charges in the country.

41:00.760 --> 41:07.160
 There's some inequities along race and class in the criminal justice system that we really

41:07.160 --> 41:15.200
 have to fix and they've grown to more than bugs in the system and have become features

41:15.200 --> 41:17.120
 unfortunately of our system.

41:17.120 --> 41:23.200
 Features to make it more efficient to make judgments so the racism makes it more efficient.

41:23.200 --> 41:33.240
 It really efficiently moves people from society to the streets and that's and a lot of innocent

41:33.240 --> 41:34.920
 people get caught up in that.

41:34.920 --> 41:39.360
 Well, let me ask in terms of the innocence.

41:39.360 --> 41:50.360
 So you've gotten a lot of people who are innocent, I guess revealed their innocence, demonstrated

41:50.360 --> 41:51.600
 their innocence.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.240
 What's that process like?

41:53.240 --> 41:55.440
 What's it like emotionally, psychologically?

41:55.440 --> 42:04.320
 What's it like legally to fight the system in through the process of revealing sort of

42:04.320 --> 42:05.880
 the innocence of a human being?

42:05.880 --> 42:09.040
 Yeah, emotionally and psychologically it can be taxing.

42:09.040 --> 42:17.320
 I follow a model of what's called empathic representation and that is I get to know my

42:17.320 --> 42:21.960
 clients and their family that I get to know their strivings, their aspirations, their

42:21.960 --> 42:24.400
 fears, their sorrows.

42:24.400 --> 42:34.280
 So that certainly sometimes can do psychic injury on one if you get really invested and

42:34.280 --> 42:42.680
 really sad and or happy and it does become emotionally taxing.

42:42.680 --> 42:48.720
 With the idea of someone sitting in jail for 20 years, completely innocent of a crime,

42:48.720 --> 42:54.720
 can you imagine sitting there every day for 20 years knowing that you factually did not

42:54.720 --> 42:59.800
 do the thing that you were convicted of by a jury of your peers?

42:59.800 --> 43:05.560
 It's got to be the most incredible thing in the world.

43:05.560 --> 43:09.680
 But the people who do it and the people who make it and come out on the other side as

43:09.680 --> 43:16.800
 productive citizens are folks who say they've come to an inner peace in their own minds

43:16.800 --> 43:27.080
 and they say these bars aren't going to define me, that my humanity is there and it's immutable

43:27.080 --> 43:30.640
 and they are not bitter, which is amazing.

43:30.640 --> 43:33.560
 I would tend to think that I'm not that good of a person.

43:33.560 --> 43:40.280
 I would be bitter for every day of 20 years if I were in jail for something, but people

43:40.280 --> 43:45.000
 tell me that they can't survive, like the one cannot survive like that and you have

43:45.000 --> 43:52.720
 to come to terms with it and the people whom I've exonerated, I mean, they come out, most

43:52.720 --> 44:00.760
 of them come out and they just really just take on life with a vim and vigor without

44:00.760 --> 44:01.760
 bitterness.

44:01.760 --> 44:05.000
 And it's a beautiful thing to see.

44:05.000 --> 44:10.800
 Do you think it's possible to eradicate racism from the judicial system?

44:10.800 --> 44:11.800
 I do.

44:11.800 --> 44:19.280
 I think that race insinuates itself in all aspects of our lives and the judicial system

44:19.280 --> 44:21.320
 is not immune from that.

44:21.320 --> 44:29.600
 So to the extent we begin to eradicate dangerous and deleterious race thinking from society

44:29.600 --> 44:36.280
 generally, then it will be eradicated from the criminal justice system.

44:36.280 --> 44:41.840
 I think we've got a lot of work to do and I think it'll be a while, but I think it's

44:41.840 --> 44:42.840
 doable.

44:42.840 --> 44:52.120
 I mean, you know, the country, so historians will look back 300 years from now and take

44:52.120 --> 45:02.480
 note of the incredible journey of diasporic Africans in the US, an incredible journey

45:02.480 --> 45:12.560
 from slavery to the heights of politics and business and judiciary and the academy and

45:12.560 --> 45:13.560
 so forth.

45:13.560 --> 45:19.600
 It's not a lot of time and actually not a lot of time and if we can have that sort

45:19.600 --> 45:25.720
 of movement historically, let's think about what the next 175 years will look like.

45:25.720 --> 45:31.880
 I'm not saying it's going to be short, but I'm saying that if we keep at it, keep getting

45:31.880 --> 45:41.680
 to know each other a little better, keep enforcing laws that prohibit the sort of race based

45:41.680 --> 45:48.640
 discrimination that people have experienced and provide as a society opportunities for

45:48.640 --> 45:55.280
 people to thrive in this world, then I think we can see a better world and if we see a

45:55.280 --> 45:58.160
 better world, we'll see a better judicial system.

45:58.160 --> 46:01.920
 So I think it's kind of fascinating if you look throughout history and race is just part

46:01.920 --> 46:11.640
 of that is we create the other and treat the other with disdain through the legal system

46:11.640 --> 46:13.760
 but just through human nature.

46:13.760 --> 46:18.400
 I tend to believe we mentioned offline that I work with robots.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.920
 It sounds absurd to say, especially to you, especially because we're talking about racism

46:21.920 --> 46:23.640
 and it's so prevalent today.

46:23.640 --> 46:32.400
 I do believe that there will be almost like a civil rights movement for robots because

46:32.400 --> 46:42.080
 with I think there's a huge value to society of having artificial intelligence systems

46:42.080 --> 46:48.320
 that interact with humans and are human like.

46:48.320 --> 46:55.880
 And the more they become human like, they will start to ask very fundamentally human

46:55.880 --> 47:00.920
 questions about freedom, about suffering, about justice.

47:00.920 --> 47:07.280
 And they will have to come face to face like look in the mirror and ask in the question

47:07.280 --> 47:14.560
 just because we're biologically based, just because we're sort of, well, just because

47:14.560 --> 47:19.920
 we're human, does that mean we're the only ones that deserve the rights?

47:19.920 --> 47:29.360
 Again, forming another group which is robots and I'm sure there could be along that path

47:29.360 --> 47:32.360
 different versions of other that we form.

47:32.360 --> 47:39.240
 So racism, race is certainly a big other that we've made, as you said, a lot of progress

47:39.240 --> 47:41.600
 on throughout the history of this country.

47:41.600 --> 47:47.040
 But it does feel like we always create, as we make progress, create new other groups.

47:47.040 --> 47:52.440
 And of course, the other group that perhaps is outside the legal system that people talk

47:52.440 --> 48:00.120
 about is the essential, no, I eat a lot of meat, but the torture of animals that people

48:00.120 --> 48:04.160
 talk about when we look back from, you know, a couple centuries from now, look back at

48:04.160 --> 48:08.680
 the kind of things we're doing to animals, we might regret that, we might see that in

48:08.680 --> 48:09.680
 a very different light.

48:09.680 --> 48:15.240
 And it's kind of interesting to see the future trajectory of what we wake up to about the

48:15.240 --> 48:20.120
 injustice in our, in our ways.

48:20.120 --> 48:24.640
 But the robot one is the one I'm especially focused on because, but at this moment in

48:24.640 --> 48:28.880
 time, it seems ridiculous, but I'm sure most civil rights movements throughout history

48:28.880 --> 48:30.520
 seem ridiculous at first.

48:30.520 --> 48:37.440
 Well, it's interesting, sort of outside of my intellectual Bailey Wick robots.

48:37.440 --> 48:52.360
 As I understand the development of artificial intelligence, though, the, the aspect that

48:52.360 --> 49:00.440
 still is missing is this notion of consciousness and that it's, it's consciousness.

49:00.440 --> 49:09.080
 That is the thing that will, will move if it were to exist, and I'm not saying that

49:09.080 --> 49:20.040
 it can or will, but if it were to exist would move robots from machines to something different

49:20.040 --> 49:27.800
 and that it's something that experienced the world in a way analogous to what, how we experience

49:27.800 --> 49:29.600
 it.

49:29.600 --> 49:35.800
 And also as I understand the science, there's a, unlike what you see on, on television that

49:35.800 --> 49:44.680
 we're not, we're not there yet in terms of this notion of the machines having a consciousness.

49:44.680 --> 49:51.440
 Or, or a great general intelligence, all those kinds of things, a huge amount of progress

49:51.440 --> 49:55.520
 has been made and there, it's fascinating to watch.

49:55.520 --> 50:01.720
 So I'm on both minds as a person who's building them, I'm realizing how sort of quote unquote

50:01.720 --> 50:09.400
 dumb they are, but also looking at human history and how poor we are predicting the progress

50:09.400 --> 50:15.680
 of innovation and technology, it's obvious that we have to be humble by our ability to

50:15.680 --> 50:23.040
 predict coupled with the fact that we keep, to use terminology carefully here, we keep

50:23.040 --> 50:28.120
 discriminating against the intelligence of artificial systems.

50:28.120 --> 50:33.840
 The smarter they get, the more ways we find to dismiss the, their intelligence.

50:33.840 --> 50:41.200
 So this, this has just been going on throughout where I, it's almost as if we're threatened

50:41.200 --> 50:45.840
 in the most primitive human way, not animalistic way.

50:45.840 --> 50:52.400
 We're threatened by the power of other creatures and we want to lessen, dismiss them.

50:52.400 --> 50:55.160
 So consciousness is a really important one.

50:55.160 --> 51:00.960
 But the one I think about a lot in terms of consciousness, the very engineering question

51:00.960 --> 51:06.840
 is whether the display of consciousness is the same as the possession of consciousness.

51:06.840 --> 51:15.200
 So if a robot tells you they are conscious, if a robot looks like they're suffering when

51:15.200 --> 51:21.200
 you torture them, if a robot is afraid of death and says they're afraid of death and

51:21.200 --> 51:30.920
 are legitimately afraid, like for, in terms of just everything we as humans use to determine

51:30.920 --> 51:38.200
 the ability of somebody to be their own entity, they're the one that loves, one that fears,

51:38.200 --> 51:42.960
 one that hopes, one that can suffer.

51:42.960 --> 51:50.640
 If a robot like in the dumbest of ways is able to display that, we, it change, it starts

51:50.640 --> 51:53.240
 changing things very quickly.

51:53.240 --> 51:58.520
 I'm not sure what it is, but it does seem that there's a huge component to consciousness

51:58.520 --> 52:01.560
 that is a social creation.

52:01.560 --> 52:04.480
 We together create our consciousness.

52:04.480 --> 52:08.160
 We believe our common humanity together.

52:08.160 --> 52:12.120
 Alone, we wouldn't be aware of our humanity.

52:12.120 --> 52:18.880
 And the law, as it protects our freedoms, seems to be a construct of the social construct.

52:18.880 --> 52:26.880
 And when you add other creatures into it, it's not obvious to me that you have to build,

52:26.880 --> 52:30.920
 there'll be a moment when you say, this thing is now conscious.

52:30.920 --> 52:35.360
 I think there's going to be a lot of fake it until you make it, and there'll be a very

52:35.360 --> 52:43.000
 gray area between fake and make that is going to force us to contend with what it means

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
 to be an entity that deserves rights.

52:46.000 --> 52:53.880
 Where all men are created equal, the men part might have to expand in ways that we are not

52:53.880 --> 52:54.880
 yet anticipating.

52:54.880 --> 52:55.880
 It's very interesting.

52:55.880 --> 53:01.320
 I mean, my favorite, the fundamentals thing I love about artificial intelligence is to

53:01.320 --> 53:02.600
 get smarter and smarter.

53:02.600 --> 53:09.680
 It challenges to think of what is right, the questions of justice, questions of freedom.

53:09.680 --> 53:21.680
 It basically challenges us to understand our own mind, to understand what like almost from

53:21.680 --> 53:26.520
 an engineering first principles perspective to understand what it is that makes us human

53:26.520 --> 53:31.320
 that is at the core of all the rights that we talk about and all the documents we write.

53:31.320 --> 53:36.640
 So even if we don't give rights to artificial intelligence systems, we may be able to construct

53:36.640 --> 53:40.320
 more fair legal systems to protect us humans.

53:40.320 --> 53:49.360
 Well, I mean, interesting ontological question between the performance of consciousness and

53:49.360 --> 53:57.440
 actual consciousness to the extent that it's, that actual consciousness is anything beyond

53:57.440 --> 54:00.240
 some contingent reality.

54:00.240 --> 54:06.120
 But you've posed a number of interesting philosophical questions and then there's also, it strikes

54:06.120 --> 54:13.840
 me that the philosophers of religion would pose another set of questions as well when

54:13.840 --> 54:25.280
 you deal with issues of structure versus soul, body versus soul and it would be a, it will

54:25.280 --> 54:32.680
 be a complicated mix and I suspect I'll be dust by the time those questions get worked

54:32.680 --> 54:33.680
 out.

54:33.680 --> 54:37.040
 And so yeah, the soul, the soul is a fun one.

54:37.040 --> 54:38.040
 There's no soul.

54:38.040 --> 54:42.800
 I'm not sure maybe you can correct me, but there's very few discussion of soul in our

54:42.800 --> 54:44.680
 legal system, right?

54:44.680 --> 54:47.680
 Right, correct.

54:47.680 --> 54:53.040
 But there is a discussion about what constitutes a human being and I mean, you gestured at

54:53.040 --> 55:02.960
 the notion of the potential of the law widening the domain of, so of human being, so in that

55:02.960 --> 55:10.720
 sense, right, you know, people are very angry because they can't get a sort of pain and

55:10.720 --> 55:17.680
 suffering damages if someone negligently kills a pet because a pet is not a human being

55:17.680 --> 55:25.360
 and people say, well, I love my pet, but the law sees a pet as chattel, as property like

55:25.360 --> 55:27.920
 this water bottle.

55:27.920 --> 55:37.360
 So the current legal definitions trade on a definition of humanity that may not be worked

55:37.360 --> 55:45.480
 out in any sophisticated way, but certainly there's a broad and shared understanding of

55:45.480 --> 55:54.320
 what it means, so probably doesn't explicitly contain a definition of something like soul,

55:54.320 --> 56:02.040
 but it's more robust than, you know, a carbon based organism, that there's something a little

56:02.040 --> 56:07.000
 more distinct about what the law thinks a human being is.

56:07.000 --> 56:12.560
 So if we can dive into, we've already been doing it, but if we can dive into more difficult

56:12.560 --> 56:20.680
 territory, so 2020 had the tragic case of George Floyd.

56:20.680 --> 56:27.800
 When you reflect on the protests, on the racial tensions over the death of George Floyd, how

56:27.800 --> 56:29.640
 do you make sense of it all?

56:29.640 --> 56:32.520
 What do you take away from these events?

56:32.520 --> 56:47.160
 The George Floyd moment occurred at an historical moment where people were quarantined for COVID

56:47.160 --> 56:57.280
 and people have these cell phones to a degree greater than we've ever had them before and

56:57.280 --> 57:03.560
 this was a sort of the straw that broke the camel's back after a number of these sorts

57:03.560 --> 57:10.840
 of cell phone videos surfaced, people were fed up.

57:10.840 --> 57:21.920
 There was unimpeachable evidence of a form of mistreatment, whether it constitutes murder

57:21.920 --> 57:27.920
 or manslaughter, the trial is going on now and jurors will figure that out, but there

57:27.920 --> 57:36.480
 was widespread appreciation that a fellow human being was mistreated, that we were just

57:36.480 --> 57:43.920
 talking about humanity, that there was not a sufficient recognition of this person's

57:43.920 --> 57:44.920
 humanity.

57:44.920 --> 57:46.640
 The common humanity of this person.

57:46.640 --> 57:51.160
 The common humanity of this person, well said, and people were fed up.

57:51.160 --> 57:59.680
 So we were already in this COVID space where we were exercising care for one another and

57:59.680 --> 58:04.720
 there was just an explosion, the likes of which this country hasn't seen since the civil

58:04.720 --> 58:14.960
 rights protests of the 1950s and 1960s and people simply said enough, enough, enough,

58:14.960 --> 58:15.960
 enough.

58:15.960 --> 58:16.960
 This has to stop.

58:16.960 --> 58:23.240
 We cannot treat fellow citizens in this way and we can't do it with impunity.

58:23.240 --> 58:28.040
 And the young people say, we're just, we're not going to stand for it anymore and they

58:28.040 --> 58:30.120
 took to the streets.

58:30.120 --> 58:38.520
 But with millions of people protesting, there is nevertheless taken us back to the most

58:38.520 --> 58:40.680
 difficult of trials.

58:40.680 --> 58:45.720
 You have the trial, like you mentioned, that's going on now of Derek Chauvin of one of the

58:45.720 --> 58:49.560
 police officers involved.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.200
 What are your thoughts?

58:51.200 --> 58:57.360
 What are your predictions on this trial where the law, the process of the law is trying

58:57.360 --> 59:01.640
 to proceed in the face of so much racial tension?

59:01.640 --> 59:04.360
 Yeah, it's going to be an interesting trial.

59:04.360 --> 59:10.800
 I've been keeping an eye on it there in jury selection now today as we're talking.

59:10.800 --> 59:13.800
 So that's going to depend on what sort of jury gets selected.

59:13.800 --> 59:19.960
 Yeah, how the, sorry to take, sorry to interrupt, but so one of the interesting qualities of

59:19.960 --> 59:24.960
 this trial, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but the cameras are allowed in the

59:24.960 --> 59:28.360
 courtroom, at least during the jury selection.

59:28.360 --> 59:31.760
 So you get to watch some of this stuff.

59:31.760 --> 59:36.360
 And the other part is the jury selection, again, I'm very inexperienced, but it seems

59:36.360 --> 59:43.720
 like selecting and what is it, unbiased jury is really difficult for this trial.

59:43.720 --> 59:54.160
 It almost like, I don't know, me as a listener, listening to people that are trying to talk

59:54.160 --> 1:00:00.200
 their way into the jury kind of thing, trying to decide, is this person really unbiased

1:00:00.200 --> 1:00:06.400
 or are they just trying to hold on to their deeply held emotions and trying to get onto

1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:07.400
 the jury?

1:00:07.400 --> 1:00:09.080
 I mean, it's incredibly difficult process.

1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:13.680
 I don't know if you can comment on a case so difficult, like the ones you've mentioned

1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:20.560
 before, how do you select a jury that represents the people and doesn't, and carries the sort

1:00:20.560 --> 1:00:22.080
 of the ideal of the law?

1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:23.720
 Yeah, so a couple of things.

1:00:23.720 --> 1:00:28.920
 So first, yes, it is televised and it will be televised as they say, gavel to gavel.

1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:32.600
 So the entire trial, the whole thing is going to be televised.

1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:39.560
 So people are getting a view of how laborious jury selection can be.

1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:44.360
 I think as of yesterday, they had picked six jurors and it's taken a week and they have

1:00:44.360 --> 1:00:46.480
 to get to 14.

1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:52.680
 So they've got, you know, probably another week or more to do.

1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:56.380
 I've been in jury trials where it took a month to choose a jury.

1:00:56.380 --> 1:01:01.720
 So that's the most important part, you have to choose the right sort of jury.

1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:06.760
 So unbiased in the criminal justice system has a particular meaning.

1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:12.120
 It means that, let me tell you what it doesn't mean.

1:01:12.120 --> 1:01:17.800
 It doesn't mean that a person is not aware of the case.

1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:22.840
 It also does not mean that a person hasn't formed an opinion about the case.

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:26.400
 Those are two popular misconceptions.

1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:31.600
 What it does mean is that notwithstanding whether an individual has formed an opinion,

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:35.120
 notwithstanding whether an individual knows about the case.

1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:42.200
 That individual can set aside any prior opinions, can set aside any notions that they've developed

1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:47.280
 about the case and listen to the evidence presented at trial in conjunction with the

1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:53.400
 judges instructions on how to understand and view that evidence.

1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:58.800
 So if a person can do that, then they're considered unbiased.

1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:07.520
 So as a long time defense attorney, I would be hesitant in a big case like this to pick

1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:11.920
 a juror who's never heard of a case or anything going around because I'm thinking, well, who

1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:17.880
 is this person and what in the world do they do?

1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:19.280
 Or are they lying to me?

1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:23.040
 How can you not have heard about this case?

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:25.960
 So they may bring other problems.

1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:30.880
 So I don't mind so much people who've heard about the case or folks who've formed initial

1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:39.960
 opinions, but what you don't want is people who have tethered themselves to that opinion

1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:46.520
 in a way that they can't be convinced otherwise.

1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:52.080
 But you also have people who, as you suggested, who just lie because they want to get on the

1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:54.440
 jury or lie because they want to get off the jury.

1:02:54.440 --> 1:03:02.200
 So sometimes people come and say the most ridiculous, outrageous, offensive things because they

1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:05.000
 know that they'll get excused for cause.

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:11.200
 And others who you can tell really badly want to get on the jury.

1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:19.400
 So they pretend to be the most neutral, unbiased person in the world.

1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:21.200
 What the law calls the reasonable person.

1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:24.400
 We have in law the reasonable person standard.

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:32.000
 And I would tell my class the reasonable person in real life is the person that you would

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.160
 be least likely to want to have a drink with.

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:40.560
 They're the most boring, neutral, not interesting sort of person in the world.

1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:48.040
 And so a lot of jurors engage in the performative act of presenting themselves as the most

1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:52.520
 sort of even killed, rational, reasonable person because they really want to get on

1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:53.520
 the jury.

1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:55.080
 That's an interesting question.

1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:56.080
 I apologize.

1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:00.360
 I haven't watched the lot because it is very long I watched it.

1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:06.200
 You know, there's certain questions you've asked in the jury, you ask in the jury selection.

1:04:06.200 --> 1:04:14.520
 I remember, I think one jumped out at me, which is, you know, something like, does the

1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:21.560
 fact that this person is a police officer make you feel any kind of way about them?

1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:27.200
 So trying to get at that, you know, I don't know what that is, I guess that's bias.

1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:32.440
 And it's such a difficult question to ask, like I asked myself for that question.

1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:38.320
 Like how much, you know, we all kind of want to pretend that we're not racist and we don't

1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:43.280
 judge, we don't have, we're like these, we're the reasonable human.

1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:47.960
 But you know, legitimately asking yourself, like, are you, what are the, what are the

1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:53.120
 prejudgments you have in your mind?

1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:55.680
 Is that even possible for a human being?

1:04:55.680 --> 1:04:59.480
 Like when you look at yourself in the mirror and think about it, is it possible to actually

1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:00.480
 answer that?

1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:01.480
 Yeah.

1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:08.040
 I look, I do not believe that people can be completely unbiased.

1:05:08.040 --> 1:05:15.800
 We all have baggage and bias and bring it wherever we go, including to court.

1:05:15.800 --> 1:05:25.520
 What you want is to try to find a person who can at least recognize when a bias is working

1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:29.120
 and actively try to do the right thing.

1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:31.680
 That's the best we can ask.

1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:36.880
 So if a juror says, yeah, you know, I grew up in a place where I tend to believe what

1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:39.680
 police officers say, that's just how I grew up.

1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:45.880
 But if the judge is telling me that I have to listen to every witness equally, then I'll,

1:05:45.880 --> 1:05:51.440
 you know, I'll do my best and I won't weigh that testimony any higher than I would any

1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:52.440
 other testimony.

1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:57.240
 If you have someone answer a question like that, that sounds more sincere to me, sounds

1:05:57.240 --> 1:05:58.240
 more honest.

1:05:58.240 --> 1:06:02.000
 And if you want a person, you want a person to try to do that.

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:06.720
 And then in closing arguments, right, as the lawyer, where I'd say something like, ladies

1:06:06.720 --> 1:06:12.280
 and gentlemen, you know, we chose you to be on this jury because you swore that you would

1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:17.280
 do your level best to be fair.

1:06:17.280 --> 1:06:19.400
 That's why we chose you.

1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:23.000
 And I'm confident that you're going to do that here.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:30.000
 So when you heard that police officer's testimony, the judge told you, you can't give more credit

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:33.640
 to that testimony just because it's a police officer.

1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:37.680
 And I trust that you're going to do that and that you're going to look at witness number

1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:40.920
 three, you know, John Smith, you're going to look at John Smith.

1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:47.760
 John Smith has a different recollection and you're duty bound, duty bound to look at that

1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:52.960
 testimony and this person's credibility, you know, the same degree as that other witness,

1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:53.960
 right?

1:06:53.960 --> 1:06:58.680
 And now what you have is just a he said, she said, matter, and this is a criminal case.

1:06:58.680 --> 1:07:01.160
 That has to be reasonable doubt, right?

1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:07.240
 So you know, and really someone who's trying to do the right thing, it's helpful, but no,

1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:11.640
 you're not going to just fine 14 people with no biases.

1:07:11.640 --> 1:07:12.640
 That's absurd.

1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:17.080
 Well, that's fascinating that especially the way you're inspiring the way you're speaking

1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:20.200
 now is, I mean, I guess you're calling on the jury.

1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:23.920
 That's kind of the whole system is you're calling on the jury, each individual on the

1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:31.000
 jury to step up and really think, you know, to step up and be their most thoughtful,

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:37.160
 thoughtful selves, actually, most introspective, like you're trying to basically ask people

1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:41.320
 to be their best selves.

1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:47.080
 And that's, and they, I guess a lot of people step up to that, that's why the system works.

1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:51.160
 I'm very, I'm very pro jury of juries.

1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:52.160
 They get it right.

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:53.160
 It works.

1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:58.080
 A lot of the time, most of the time, and they really work hard to do it.

1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:02.400
 So what do you think happens?

1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:11.640
 I mean, maybe, I'm not so much on the legal side of things, but on the social side, it's

1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:15.440
 like with OJ Simpson trial.

1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:19.800
 Do you think it's possible that Derek Chauvin does not get convicted of the, what is it,

1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:23.000
 second degree murder?

1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:24.760
 How do you think about that?

1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:27.840
 How do you think about the potential social impact of that?

1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:34.880
 The riots, the protests, the either, either direction, any words that are said, the tension

1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:38.680
 here could be explosive, especially with the cameras.

1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:39.680
 Yeah.

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:40.680
 Yeah.

1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:49.880
 So yes, there's certainly a possibility that he'll be acquitted for homicide charges for

1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:52.480
 the jury to convict.

1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:59.040
 They have to make a determination as to officer Chauvin's, former officer Chauvin's state

1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:10.200
 of mind, whether he intended to cause some harm, whether he was grossly reckless in causing

1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:16.240
 harm so much so that he disregarded a known risk of death or serious bodily injury.

1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:23.640
 And as you may have read in the papers yesterday, the judge allowed a third degree murder charge

1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:33.800
 in Kentucky, which is, it's the mindset, the state of mind there is not an intention,

1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:37.200
 but it's a depraved indifference.

1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:42.440
 And what that means is that the jury doesn't have to find that he intended to do anything.

1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:50.040
 Rather, they could find that he was just indifferent to a risk.

1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:51.040
 As dark.

1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:52.040
 Yeah.

1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:53.040
 Yeah.

1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:55.040
 I'm not sure what's worse.

1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:01.480
 Well, that's a good point, but it's another basis for the jury to convict.

1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:04.680
 But look, you never know what happens when you go to a jury trial.

1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:09.360
 So there could be an acquittal.

1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:16.480
 And if there is, I imagine there would be massive protests.

1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:24.120
 If he's convicted, I don't think that would happen because I just don't see at least nothing

1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:31.640
 I've seen or read suggest that there's a big pro Chauvin camp out there ready to protest.

1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:37.600
 Well, there could be a, is there also potential tensions that could arise from the sentencing?

1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:39.600
 I don't know how that exactly works.

1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:41.600
 Sort of not enough years kind of thing.

1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:42.600
 Yeah, it could be.

1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:43.600
 All that kind of stuff.

1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:45.000
 I mean, it's a lot could happen.

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.040
 So it depends on what he's convicted of.

1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:52.800
 You know, one count I think is like up to 10 years, another counts up to 40 years.

1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:54.480
 So it depends what he's convicted of.

1:10:54.480 --> 1:11:01.960
 And yes, it depends on how much of the, how much time the judge gives him if he is convicted.

1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:04.840
 There's a lot of space for people to be very angry in.

1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:07.560
 So we will see what happens.

1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:15.600
 I just feel like with the judge and the lawyers, there's an opportunity to have really important

1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:18.000
 long lasting speeches.

1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:23.240
 I don't know if they think of it that way, especially with the cameras.

1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:29.880
 It feels like they have the capacity to heal or to divide.

1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:35.920
 Do you ever think about that as a lawyer, as a legal mind that your words aren't just

1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:42.800
 about the case, but they'll reverberate through history potentially?

1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:49.320
 That is certainly a possible consequence of things you say.

1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:55.480
 I don't think that most lawyers think about that in the context of the case.

1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:58.160
 Your role is much more narrow.

1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:04.560
 You're the partisan advocate, as a defense lawyer, partisan advocate for that client

1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:05.720
 as a prosecutor.

1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:11.760
 You're a minister of justice attempting to prosecute that particular case.

1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:19.400
 But the reality is you are absolutely correct that sometimes the things you say will have

1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:20.800
 a shelf life.

1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:25.840
 You mentioned OJ Simpson before, you know, if the glove doesn't fit, you must have quit.

1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:32.480
 It's going to be in our lexicon for probably a long time now, so it happens.

1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:37.680
 But that's not, and shouldn't be foremost on your mind.

1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:40.880
 What do you make of the OJ Simpson trial?

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:44.400
 Do you have thoughts about it?

1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:48.520
 He's out and about on social media now, he's a public figure.

1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:51.320
 Is there lessons to be drawn from that whole saga?

1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:53.840
 Well, you know, that was an interesting case.

1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:58.760
 That was a young public defender, I want to say, in my first year as a public defender

1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:00.400
 when that verdict came out.

1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:03.280
 So that case was important in so many ways.

1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:10.880
 One, it was the first DNA case, major DNA case, and there were significant lessons learned

1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:11.880
 from that.

1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:20.000
 One mistake that the prosecution made was that they didn't present the science in a

1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:25.120
 way that a lay jury could understand it.

1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:34.720
 And what Johnny Cochran did was he understood the science and was able to translate that

1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:43.120
 into a vocabulary that he bet that that jury understood.

1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:46.680
 So Cochran was dismissive of a lot of DNA.

1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:55.440
 They say they found such and such amount of DNA, that's just like me wiping my finger

1:13:55.440 --> 1:14:04.000
 against my nose and just that little bit of DNA, and that was effective because the prosecution

1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:09.920
 hadn't done a good job of establishing that, yes, it's microscopic, you don't need that

1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:10.920
 much.

1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:14.800
 Yes, wiping your hand on your nose and touching something, you can transfer a lot of DNA and

1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:17.120
 that gives you good information.

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:22.180
 But it was the first time that the public generally, and that jury maybe since high

1:14:22.180 --> 1:14:28.280
 school science had heard nucleotide, I mean, it was just all these terms getting thrown

1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:33.240
 at them, but it was not weaved into a narrative.

1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:40.560
 So Cochran taught us that no matter what type of case it is, no matter what science is involved,

1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:50.680
 it's still about storytelling, it's still about a narrative and he was great at that

1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:56.520
 narrative and was consistent with his narrative all the way out.

1:14:56.520 --> 1:15:03.520
 Another lesson that was relearned is that you never ask a question to which you don't

1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:09.360
 know the answer, that's like trial advocacy 101.

1:15:09.360 --> 1:15:15.840
 And so when they gave O.J. Simpson the glove and it wouldn't fit, you know, you don't do

1:15:15.840 --> 1:15:20.800
 things where you just don't know how it's going to turn out, it was way, way too risky

1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:25.960
 and then, and I think that's what acquitted him, because that glove, the glove just wouldn't

1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:33.280
 fit and he got to do this and ham in front of the camera and all of that and it was big.

1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:38.080
 Do you think about representation as storytelling, like you, yourself and your role?

1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:39.080
 Absolutely.

1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:48.000
 We tell stories, it is fundamental, we, since time immemorial, we have told stories to help

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:51.560
 us make sense of the world around us.

1:15:51.560 --> 1:16:03.160
 So as a scientist, you tell a different type of story, but we as a public have told stories

1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:09.640
 from time immemorial to help us make sense of the physical and the natural world and

1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:15.280
 we are still a species that is moved by storytelling.

1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:22.400
 So that's first and last in trial work, you have to tell a good story.

1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:28.920
 And you know, the basic introductory books about trial work teach young students, young

1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:35.920
 students and young lawyers to start an opening with this case is about, this case is about

1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:39.600
 and then you fill in the blank and you know, that's your narrative, that's the narrative

1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:41.560
 you're going to, you're going to tell.

1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:47.440
 And of course, you can do the ultra dramatic, the glove doesn't fit kind of the climax

1:16:47.440 --> 1:16:55.360
 and all those kinds of things, but that's the best of narratives, the best of stories.

1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:59.680
 Anything of other really powerful stories that you were involved with is the Aaron Hernandez

1:16:59.680 --> 1:17:03.520
 trial and the whole story, the whole legal case.

1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:09.240
 Can you maybe overview the big picture story and legal case of Aaron Hernandez?

1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:10.240
 Yeah.

1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:14.840
 So Aaron, whom I missed a lot.

1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:20.400
 So he was charged with a double murder in the case that I tried.

1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:26.760
 And this was a unique case and one of those impossible cases in part because Aaron had

1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:31.000
 already been convicted of a murder.

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:36.400
 And so we had a client who was on trial for a double murder after having already been

1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:40.040
 convicted of a separate murder.

1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:48.440
 And we had a jury pool just about all of whom knew that he had been convicted of a murder

1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:54.520
 because he was a very popular football player in Boston, which is a big football town with

1:17:54.520 --> 1:17:55.920
 the Patriots.

1:17:55.920 --> 1:18:02.800
 So everyone knew that he was a convicted murderer and here we are defending for in a double

1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:04.960
 murder case.

1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:07.800
 So that was the context.

1:18:07.800 --> 1:18:15.880
 It was not a case in the sense that this murder had gone unsolved for a couple of years and

1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:27.040
 then a nightclub bouncer said something to a cop who was working at a club that Aaron

1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:32.320
 Hernandez was somehow involved in that murder that happened in the theater district.

1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:37.320
 That's a district where all the clubs are in Boston and where the homicide occurred.

1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:44.240
 And once the police heard Aaron Hernandez's name, then it was, you know, they went all

1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:47.080
 out in order to do this.

1:18:47.080 --> 1:19:01.760
 They found a guy named Alexander Bradley who was a very significant drug dealer in the

1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:13.080
 sort of Connecticut area, very significant, very powerful and he essentially in exchange

1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:24.080
 for a deal, point it to Aaron said, yeah, I was with Aaron and Aaron was the murderer.

1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:25.960
 So that's how the case came to court.

1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:26.960
 Okay.

1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:28.400
 So that says the context.

1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:31.440
 What was your involvement in this case?

1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:40.560
 Like legally, intellectually, psychologically, when this particular second charge of murder?

1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:50.120
 So a friend called me, Jose Baez, who is the defense attorney and he comes to a class that

1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:58.640
 I teach every year at Harvard, the trial advocacy workshop as one of my teaching faculty members.

1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:02.440
 It's a class where we teach students how to try cases.

1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:12.600
 So Jose called me and said, hey, I got a call from Massachusetts, Aaron Hernandez.

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:15.720
 You want to go and talk to him with me.

1:20:15.720 --> 1:20:16.720
 So I said, sure.

1:20:16.720 --> 1:20:26.760
 So we went up to the prison and met Aaron and spoke with him for two or three hours at

1:20:26.760 --> 1:20:32.360
 first time and before we left, he said he wanted to retain us.

1:20:32.360 --> 1:20:34.960
 He wanted to work with us and that started the representation.

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:37.400
 What was he like?

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:42.040
 In that time, what was he worn down by the whole process?

1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:44.360
 Was there still a light in that?

1:20:44.360 --> 1:20:45.600
 He was not.

1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:49.720
 He had, I mean, more than just a light, he was luminous almost.

1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:55.560
 He had a radiant million dollar smile whenever you walked in.

1:20:55.560 --> 1:21:01.000
 My first impression I distinctly remember was, wow, this is what a professional athlete

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.000
 looks like.

1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:10.800
 He walked in and he's just bigger and more fit than anyone anywhere and it's like, wow,

1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:15.480
 and when you saw him on television, he looked kind of little and I was like, so I remember

1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:21.760
 thinking, well, what do those other guys look like in person?

1:21:21.760 --> 1:21:32.800
 And he's extraordinarily polite, young, I was surprised by how young he was.

1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:36.400
 Both in mind and body.

1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:42.000
 Chronologically, I was thinking, he was in his early 20s, I believe.

1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:46.440
 But there seemed to be like an innocence to him in terms of just the way he saw the world.

1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:47.440
 I think that's right.

1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:50.800
 They picked that up from the documentary, just taking that in.

1:21:50.800 --> 1:21:51.800
 I think that's right.

1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:52.800
 Yeah.

1:21:52.800 --> 1:21:53.800
 Yeah.

1:21:53.800 --> 1:22:01.160
 So there is a Netflix documentary titled Killer Inside the Mind of Aaron Hernandez.

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:02.760
 What are your thoughts on this documentary?

1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:04.960
 I don't know if you've gotten a chance to see it.

1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:05.960
 I've not seen it.

1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:07.120
 I did not participate in it.

1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:13.440
 I know I was in it because of there was news footage, but I did not participate in it.

1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:22.320
 I had not talked to Aaron about press or anything before he died.

1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:25.840
 My strong view is that the attorney client privilege survives death.

1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:29.880
 And so I was not inclined to talk about anything that Aaron and I talked about.

1:22:29.880 --> 1:22:34.240
 So I just didn't participate and have never watched.

1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:36.800
 Not even watch, huh?

1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:39.600
 Does that apply to most of your work?

1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:44.120
 Do you try to stay away from the way the press perceives stuff?

1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:46.560
 During, yes, I try to stay away from it.

1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:48.680
 I will view it afterwards.

1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:53.680
 I just hadn't gotten around to watching Aaron because it's kind of sad.

1:22:53.680 --> 1:23:00.320
 So I just haven't watched it, but I definitely stay away from the press during trial.

1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:06.720
 And there are some lawyers who watch it religiously to see what's going on, but I'm confident

1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:15.800
 in my years of training and so forth that I can actively sense what's going on in the

1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:26.840
 courtroom and that I really don't need advice from Joe476 at Gmail, some random guy on the

1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:29.120
 Internet telling me how to try cases.

1:23:29.120 --> 1:23:33.400
 So it's just, to me, it's just confusing and I just keep it out of my mind.

1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:38.200
 And even if you think you can ignore it, just reading it will have a little bit of an effect

1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:39.200
 on your mind.

1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:40.680
 I think that's right.

1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:43.960
 Over time might accumulate.

1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:54.680
 So the documentary, but in general, it mentioned or kind of emphasized and talked about Aaron's

1:23:54.680 --> 1:24:02.840
 sexuality or sort of, they were discussing basically the idea that he was a homosexual

1:24:02.840 --> 1:24:10.400
 and some of the trauma, some of the suffering that he endured in his life had to do with

1:24:10.400 --> 1:24:18.680
 sort of fear given the society of what his father would think, of what others around

1:24:18.680 --> 1:24:23.080
 him, sort of especially in sport culture and football and so on.

1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:31.160
 So I don't know in your interaction with him was, do you think that maybe even leaning

1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:38.760
 up to a suicide, do you think his struggle with coming to terms with the sexuality had

1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:43.000
 a role to play in much of his difficulties?

1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:50.920
 Well, I'm not going to talk about my interactions with him and anything I derived from that.

1:24:50.920 --> 1:25:04.480
 But what I will say is that a story broke on the radio at some point during the trial

1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:11.400
 that Aaron had been in the same sex relationship with someone and some local sports casters,

1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:18.880
 local Boston sports casters would be really mushroomed the story.

1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:30.920
 So he and everyone was aware of it, you also may know from the court record that the prosecutors

1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:39.160
 floated a specious theory for a minute but then backed off of it that, you know, that

1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:46.160
 Aaron was, that there was some sort of, I guess, gay rage at work with him and that

1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:54.040
 might be a cause, a motive for the killing and luckily they really backed off of that.

1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:58.600
 That was quite an offensive claim in theory.

1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:04.680
 So but to answer your question more directly, I mean, I have no idea why he killed himself.

1:26:04.680 --> 1:26:08.520
 It was a surprise and a shock.

1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:13.040
 I was scheduled to go see him like a couple days after it happened.

1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:22.760
 I mean, he was anxious for Jose and I to come in and do the appeal from the murder which

1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:23.840
 he was convicted for.

1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:27.720
 He wanted us to take over that appeal.

1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:29.400
 He was talking about going back to football.

1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:34.400
 I mean, he said, well, you talked about this earlier, you talked about the sort of innocent

1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:35.680
 aspect of him.

1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:40.600
 He said, you know, well, Ron, maybe not, maybe not the Patriots, but, you know, get back

1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:46.600
 in the league and I was like, you know, Aaron, that's, that's going to be tough, man.

1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:53.600
 But he really, you know, he really believed it and and then, you know, for a few days

1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:57.200
 later that to happen, it was just, it was a real shock to me.

1:26:57.200 --> 1:27:04.000
 Like when you look back at that, at his story, does it make you sad?

1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.160
 Very, very.

1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:16.600
 I thought, so one, I believe he, he absolutely did not commit the crimes that we acquitted

1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:17.600
 him on.

1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:23.600
 I think that was the right answer for, for, for that.

1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:29.160
 I don't know enough about Bradley, the first case, I'm sorry, to make a make an opinion

1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:30.160
 on.

1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:37.320
 But in our case, you know, it was just, he had the misfortune of having a famous name

1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:44.320
 and the police department just really, just, just, just really got, got on him there.

1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:48.600
 So yes, it's, it's, I miss him a lot.

1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:51.000
 It was very, very sad, surprising.

1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.000
 Yeah.

1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.800
 And, and I mean, just on the human side, of course, we don't know the full story, but

1:27:56.800 --> 1:27:59.480
 just everything that led up to suicide.

1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:06.160
 Everything led up to an incredible professional football player, you know, that whole story.

1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:10.760
 It was a remarkably talented athlete, remarkably talented athlete.

1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:15.000
 And it's, it has to do with all the, all the possible trajectories, right, that we can

1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.800
 take through the life as we were talking about before.

1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:23.920
 And some of them lead to, to suicide, sadly enough.

1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:29.440
 And it's, it's always tragic when you have some, you know, somebody with, you know,

1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:35.880
 with great potential result in, in the things that happen, right.

1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:36.880
 People love it.

1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:44.040
 When I ask about books, I don't know if, whether technical, like legal or fiction, nonfiction

1:28:44.040 --> 1:28:47.720
 books throughout your life have had an impact on you.

1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:52.640
 If there's something you could recommend or something you could speak to about something

1:28:52.640 --> 1:28:58.680
 that inspired ideas, insights about this world, complicated world of ours.

1:28:58.680 --> 1:28:59.680
 Oh, wow.

1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:00.680
 Yeah.

1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:05.520
 So, I'll give you a couple.

1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:09.880
 So one is Contingency, Irony and Solidarity by Richard Wardy.

1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:17.760
 He's passed away now, but was a philosopher at some of our major institutions, Princeton,

1:29:17.760 --> 1:29:23.280
 Harvard, Stanford.

1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:27.480
 Contingency, Irony and Solidarity, at least that's a book that really helped me work

1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:31.440
 through a series of thoughts.

1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:39.880
 So it stands for the proposition that, that our most deeply held beliefs are contingent,

1:29:39.880 --> 1:29:46.920
 that there, there's nothing beyond history or prior to socialization that's the finatory

1:29:46.920 --> 1:29:50.960
 of the, of the human being that's Wardy.

1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:58.040
 And he says that our most deeply held beliefs are received wisdom and highly contingent

1:29:58.040 --> 1:30:01.920
 along a number of registers.

1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:10.080
 And he does that, but then goes on to say that he nonetheless can hold strongly held

1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:15.000
 beliefs, recognizing their contingency, but still believes them to be true and accurate.

1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:22.840
 And it helps you to work through what could be an intellectual tension, other words.

1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:29.680
 So, so you don't delve into, one doesn't delve into relativism, everything is okay.

1:30:29.680 --> 1:30:38.080
 But it gives you a vocabulary to think about how to negotiate these, these, these realities.

1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:40.080
 Do you share this tension?

1:30:40.080 --> 1:30:44.040
 I mean, there, there is a real tension that it seems like even like the law, the legal

1:30:44.040 --> 1:30:48.600
 system is all just a construct of our human ideas.

1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:57.880
 And yet it seems to be almost feels fundamental to what a, what a just society is.

1:30:57.880 --> 1:31:05.680
 Yeah, I definitely share the tension and love the, his, his vocabulary and the way he's

1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:08.960
 helped me resolve the tension.

1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:16.840
 So right, I mean, yeah, yeah, so like, you know, infanticide, for example, perhaps it's

1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:23.240
 socially contingent, perhaps it's received wisdom, perhaps it's anthropological, you

1:31:23.240 --> 1:31:27.760
 know, we need to propagate the species, and I still think it's wrong.

1:31:27.760 --> 1:31:36.080
 And, and, and, and Rory has helped me develop a category to say, to say that, no, I can't

1:31:36.080 --> 1:31:42.960
 provide any, in Rory's words, noncircular theoretical backup for this proposition.

1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:46.520
 At some point, it's going to run me in this, in a circularity problem.

1:31:46.520 --> 1:31:47.520
 But that's okay.

1:31:47.520 --> 1:31:52.120
 I, I, I, I hold this nonetheless and for recognition of its contingency.

1:31:52.120 --> 1:31:59.560
 But what it does is, is, is, is makes you humble and, and when you're humble, that's

1:31:59.560 --> 1:32:05.840
 good because, you know, this notion that ideas are always already in progress.

1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:12.640
 They're fully formed, I think is, is, is the sort of intellectual I strive to be.

1:32:12.640 --> 1:32:20.240
 And if I have a, a, a sufficient degree of humility that I don't have the final answer,

1:32:20.240 --> 1:32:26.200
 capital A, then that's going to help me to get to better answers, lowercase A. And,

1:32:26.200 --> 1:32:33.520
 and, and Rory does, and he talks about, in the solidarity part of the book, he has this

1:32:33.520 --> 1:32:42.280
 concept of imaginative, I, the imaginative ability to see other different people as we

1:32:42.280 --> 1:32:43.880
 instead of they.

1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:47.600
 And I just think it's a beautiful concept, but he talks about this imaginative ability

1:32:47.600 --> 1:32:49.840
 and it's this active process.

1:32:49.840 --> 1:32:59.040
 So I mean, so that's a book that's done a lot of work for me over the, the years.

1:32:59.040 --> 1:33:06.800
 Souls of Black Folk by W.B. Du Bois was absolutely pivotal, pivotal in my intellectual development.

1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:18.160
 One of the premier set of essays in the Western literary tradition and it's a deep and profound

1:33:18.160 --> 1:33:27.800
 sociological, philosophical and historical analysis of the predicament of blacks in

1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:33.680
 America from one of our country's greatest polymaths.

1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:40.760
 It, it's just a, it's a beautiful text and, and I go to it yearly.

1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:47.040
 So for somebody like me, so growing up in the Soviet Union, the struggle, the civil rights

1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:53.440
 movement, the struggle of race and all those kinds of things that, that is, you know, this

1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:57.640
 universal, but it's also very much a journey of the United States.

1:33:57.640 --> 1:34:00.840
 It was kind of a foreign thing that I stepped into.

1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:03.840
 Is that something you would recommend somebody like me to read?

1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:10.560
 Or is there other things about race that are good to connect?

1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:15.480
 Because my, my, my flavor of suffering in just I'm a Jew as well.

1:34:15.480 --> 1:34:20.000
 My flavor has to do with World War II and the studies of that, you know, all the injustices

1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:21.000
 there.

1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:26.760
 And now stepping into a new set of injustices and trying to learn the, the landscape.

1:34:26.760 --> 1:34:34.320
 I would, I would say anyone is, is a better person for having read Du Bois.

1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:41.600
 It's just, he's just a remarkable writer and thinker and it, I mean, and to the extent

1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:47.880
 you're interested in learning another history, he does it in a way that is quite sophisticated.

1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:54.960
 So it's, so it's interesting, I was going to give you three books.

1:34:54.960 --> 1:35:00.920
 I noted the accent when I met you, but I didn't know exactly where you're from.

1:35:00.920 --> 1:35:05.400
 But the other book I was going to say is Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.

1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:12.360
 And I mean, I've always wanted to go to St. Pete's just to, to sort of see with my own

1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:18.760
 eyes what the word pictures that Dostoevsky created in Crime and Punishment.

1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:23.480
 And you know, I love others of his stuff too, the Brothers Care, Masov and so forth.

1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:28.480
 But Crime and Punishment, I first read in high school as a junior or a senior.

1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:38.680
 And it is a deep and profound meditation on the, the, both the meaning and the measure

1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:40.680
 of our lives.

1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:53.200
 And Dostoevsky, obviously in, in conversation with other thinkers, really gets at the, the

1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:57.080
 crux of a fundamental philosophical problem.

1:35:57.080 --> 1:35:59.600
 What does it mean to be a human being?

1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:07.320
 And, and for that Crime and Punishment captured me as a teenager, and that's another text

1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:10.800
 that I return to often.

1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:17.040
 We've talked about young people a little bit at the beginning of our conversation.

1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:23.400
 Is there advice that you could give to a young person today, thinking about their career,

1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:28.120
 thinking about their life, thinking about making their way in this world?

1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:29.120
 Yeah, sure.

1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:30.400
 I'll share some advice.

1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:36.480
 It actually picks up on a question we talked about earlier with in the academy and schools.

1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:42.960
 But it's an, it's some advice that a professor gave to me when I got to Harvard.

1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:48.560
 And it is this, that you have to be willing to come face to face with your intellectual

1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:52.120
 limitations and keep going.

1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:53.120
 And that's it.

1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:54.120
 And it's hard for people.

1:36:54.120 --> 1:37:01.600
 I mean, you mentioned this earlier to, to face really difficult tasks to, and particularly

1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:06.880
 in these sort of elite spaces where you've excelled all your life and you come to MIT

1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:09.120
 and you're like, wait a minute, I don't understand this.

1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:10.120
 Yeah.

1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:11.120
 Wait, this is hard.

1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:14.480
 I've never had something really hard before.

1:37:14.480 --> 1:37:18.840
 And there, there are a couple options and a lot of people will pull back and take the

1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:26.920
 gentleman or just a woman's B and, and just go on or risk going out there, giving it your

1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:33.080
 all and still not quite getting it and that, that, that's a risk, but it's a risk well

1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:37.920
 worth it because you're just going to be the better person, the better student for it.

1:37:37.920 --> 1:37:43.440
 And you know, and even outside of the academy, I mean, come, come face to face with your

1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:49.280
 fears and keep going and keep going in, in, in life and you're going to be the better

1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:51.560
 person, the better human being.

1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:52.560
 Yeah.

1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:57.600
 And it does seem to be, I don't know what it is, but it does seem to be that fear is

1:37:57.600 --> 1:38:03.200
 a good indicator of something you should probably face.

1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:04.200
 Yes.

1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:08.120
 Like fear kind of shows the way a little bit.

1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:09.120
 Not always.

1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:15.920
 You might not want to go into the cage with a lion, but, but it's, maybe you should.

1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:16.920
 Maybe.

1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:22.760
 Let me ask sort of a darker question because we're talking about Dostoyevsky, who might

1:38:22.760 --> 1:38:25.440
 as well.

1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:36.400
 Do you, do you, and connected to the freeing innocent people, do you think about mortality?

1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:38.000
 Do you think about your own death?

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.400
 Are you afraid of death?

1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:42.200
 I'm not afraid of, of death.

1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:47.960
 I do think about it more now because I'm now in my mid fifties.

1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:56.080
 So I used to not think about it much at all, but the harsh reality is that I've got more

1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:01.040
 time behind me now that I do in front of me and it kind of happens all of a sudden to

1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:06.640
 realize, wait a minute, I'm, I'm, I'm actually on the back nine now.

1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:10.160
 So yeah, my mind moves to it from time to time.

1:39:10.160 --> 1:39:11.840
 I don't dwell on it.

1:39:11.840 --> 1:39:14.160
 I'm not afraid of it.

1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:21.120
 My own personal religious commitments, I'm, I'm, I'm Christian and my religious commitments

1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:28.720
 buoy me that, you know, that, that death and I, I believe this death is not, not, not

1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:29.880
 the end.

1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:31.720
 So I'm not afraid of it now.

1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:35.760
 This is not to say that I want to, I want to, I want to rush to the afterlife.

1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:42.480
 I'm good right here for a long time and I hope I've got, you know, 30, 35, 40 more years

1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:43.480
 to go.

1:39:43.480 --> 1:39:49.160
 Uh, but, um, but, um, but no, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't fear death though.

1:39:49.160 --> 1:39:52.320
 We're, we're, we're, we're finite creatures.

1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:54.280
 We're all going to, we're all going to die.

1:39:54.280 --> 1:40:00.920
 Well, the mystery of it, uh, you know, for, for somebody, at least for me, we human beings

1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:02.960
 want to figure everything out.

1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:08.160
 Uh, whatever the afterlife is, there's still a mystery to it.

1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:14.200
 That uncertainty, it can be terrifying if you ponder it, but maybe, uh, what you're

1:40:14.200 --> 1:40:21.320
 saying is, uh, you haven't pondered it too deeply so far and it's worked out pretty good.

1:40:21.320 --> 1:40:22.320
 It's worked out.

1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:23.320
 Yeah.

1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:24.320
 No, no, no complaints.

1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:31.840
 So you said, uh, again, the Sejewski kind of was exceptionally good at getting to the

1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:34.120
 core of what it means to be human.

1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:42.080
 Do you think about like the why of why we're here, the, the meaning of this whole, uh,

1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:43.080
 existence?

1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:44.080
 Yeah.

1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:45.080
 No, I, I, I do.

1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:48.960
 I think, uh, and I actually think that's the purpose of an education.

1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:51.840
 Uh, what does it mean to be a human being?

1:40:51.840 --> 1:40:58.160
 And in one way or another, uh, we set out to answer those questions and we do it in a different

1:40:58.160 --> 1:40:59.160
 way.

1:40:59.160 --> 1:41:07.320
 Uh, I mean, some, uh, may look to, uh, philosophy to answer, uh, these questions.

1:41:07.320 --> 1:41:17.000
 Why is it in one's personal interest to, to, uh, to do good, to do just, uh, to do justice?

1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:24.920
 Some may, uh, look at it through the economist's lens, uh, some may, uh, look at it through

1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:33.880
 the, uh, microscope in the laboratory that the phenomenal world is, uh, is, is the meaning,

1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:35.760
 uh, of life.

1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:44.480
 Uh, others may say that that's one, uh, vocabulary, that's one description, but the poet describes

1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:47.640
 a reality to the same degree as a physicist.

1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:51.320
 Uh, but that's the purpose of, uh, of, of an education.

1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:57.720
 Just to sort of work through these issues, what does it mean to be a, uh, uh, what does

1:41:57.720 --> 1:41:59.320
 it mean to be a human being?

1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:03.880
 And I think it's a fascinating journey and I think it's a lifelong, uh, endeavor to

1:42:03.880 --> 1:42:08.920
 figure out what is the thing that nugget that makes us, uh, human.

1:42:08.920 --> 1:42:11.760
 Do you still see yourself as a student?

1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:12.760
 Of course.

1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:13.760
 Uh, yes.

1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:18.920
 I mean, that's, uh, that's the best part about going into, into university teaching.

1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:20.840
 You're, you're a lifelong student.

1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:21.840
 I'm always learning.

1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:27.880
 I learned from my students and with my students and, uh, my colleagues and you're, you continue

1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:32.600
 to read and, and, and learn and, and modify opinions.

1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:34.800
 And I think it's just a wonderful thing.

1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:44.440
 Well, Ron, um, I'm so glad that, uh, somebody like you is, uh, carrying the fire of what

1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:45.960
 is the best of Harvard.

1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:50.920
 So it's a huge honor that you will spend so much time, waste so much of your valuable

1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:51.920
 time with me.

1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:52.920
 I really appreciate that.

1:42:52.920 --> 1:42:53.920
 Not a waste at all.

1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:55.280
 I think a lot of people love it.

1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:56.600
 Thank you so much for talking today.

1:43:18.440 --> 1:43:25.600
 to live the life he believes in, he has no choice but to become an outlaw.

1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:45.360
