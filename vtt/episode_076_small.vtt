00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
 The following is a conversation with John Hopfield,

00:03.440 --> 00:07.600
 Professor Princeton, whose life's work weaved beautifully

00:07.600 --> 00:11.700
 through biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics.

00:11.700 --> 00:15.000
 Most crucially, he saw the messy world of biology

00:15.000 --> 00:18.360
 through the piercing eyes of a physicist.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.160
 He's perhaps best known for his work

00:20.160 --> 00:22.160
 on associative neural networks,

00:22.160 --> 00:24.960
 now known as Hopfield Networks.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.720
 They were one of the early ideas that catalyzed

00:27.720 --> 00:31.400
 the development of the modern field of deep learning.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.280
 As his 2019 Franklin Medal in Physics Award states,

00:35.280 --> 00:37.800
 he applied concepts of theoretical physics

00:37.800 --> 00:41.040
 to provide new insights on important biological questions

00:41.040 --> 00:45.080
 in a variety of areas, including genetics and neuroscience,

00:45.080 --> 00:48.000
 with significant impact on machine learning.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.600
 And as John says in his 2018 article titled,

00:51.600 --> 00:55.600
 Now What, his accomplishments have often come about

00:55.600 --> 00:59.720
 by asking that very question, Now What,

00:59.720 --> 01:02.920
 and often responding by a major change of direction.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.040
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.240
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:09.240 --> 01:11.080
 give it five stars on Apple Podcasts,

01:11.080 --> 01:14.480
 support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,

01:14.480 --> 01:18.980
 and Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:18.980 --> 01:21.520
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now

01:21.520 --> 01:23.000
 and never any ads in the middle

01:23.000 --> 01:25.280
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.720
 I hope that works for you

01:26.720 --> 01:29.440
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.920
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:31.920 --> 01:34.320
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.800
 When you get it, use code Lex Podcast.

01:37.800 --> 01:41.000
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.760
 and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.000
 Since Cash App does fractional share trading,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.440
 let me mention that the order execution algorithm

01:49.440 --> 01:50.960
 that works behind the scenes

01:50.960 --> 01:53.780
 to create the abstraction of fractional orders

01:53.780 --> 01:56.360
 is to me an algorithmic marvel.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.560
 So big props to the Cash App engineers

01:58.560 --> 02:00.240
 for solving a hard problem

02:00.240 --> 02:02.680
 that in the end provides an easy interface

02:02.680 --> 02:05.320
 that takes a step up the next layer of abstraction

02:05.320 --> 02:06.680
 over the stock market,

02:06.680 --> 02:09.320
 making trading more accessible for new investors

02:09.320 --> 02:12.060
 and diversification much easier.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.400
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,

02:15.400 --> 02:18.440
 Google Play, and use code Lex Podcast,

02:18.440 --> 02:22.520
 you'll get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to first,

02:22.520 --> 02:24.200
 one of my favorite organizations

02:24.200 --> 02:27.280
 that is helping advance robotics and STEM education

02:27.280 --> 02:28.880
 for young people around the world.

02:29.880 --> 02:34.120
 And now here's my conversation with John Hopfield.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.880
 What difference between biological neural networks

02:37.880 --> 02:40.000
 and artificial neural networks

02:40.000 --> 02:42.280
 is most captivating and profound to you?

02:44.680 --> 02:47.080
 At the higher philosophical level,

02:47.080 --> 02:49.180
 let's not get technical just yet.

02:49.180 --> 02:53.340
 One of the things that very much intrigues me

02:53.340 --> 02:58.340
 is the fact that neurons have all kinds of components,

03:00.100 --> 03:01.260
 properties to them.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.420
 And evolutionary biology,

03:05.420 --> 03:07.300
 if you have some little quirk

03:07.300 --> 03:12.020
 into how a molecule works or how a cell works,

03:12.020 --> 03:15.140
 and it can make use of evolution will sharpen it up

03:15.140 --> 03:20.140
 and make it into a useful feature rather than a glitch.

03:20.220 --> 03:24.140
 And so you expect in neurobiology

03:24.140 --> 03:27.940
 for evolution to have captured all kinds of possibilities

03:27.940 --> 03:30.620
 of getting neurons, of how you get neurons

03:30.620 --> 03:31.860
 to do things for you.

03:33.100 --> 03:37.020
 And that aspect has been completely suppressed

03:37.020 --> 03:38.720
 in artificial neural networks.

03:38.720 --> 03:43.720
 Do the glitches become features in the biological neural network?

03:46.720 --> 03:48.080
 They can.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.240
 Look, let me take one of the things

03:50.240 --> 03:52.240
 that I used to do research on.

03:54.240 --> 03:58.640
 If you take things which oscillate,

03:58.640 --> 04:02.680
 they have rhythms which are sort of close to each other.

04:02.680 --> 04:03.960
 Under some circumstances,

04:03.960 --> 04:06.880
 these things will have a phase transition

04:06.880 --> 04:10.640
 and suddenly the rhythm will, everybody will fall into step.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.120
 There was a marvelous physical example of that

04:14.080 --> 04:17.120
 in the Millennium Bridge across the Thames River

04:17.120 --> 04:20.960
 about, build about 2001.

04:20.960 --> 04:23.520
 And pedestrians walking across,

04:23.520 --> 04:26.000
 pedestrians don't walk, synchronize,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.280
 they don't walk in lock step.

04:28.280 --> 04:31.480
 But they're all walking about the same frequency.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.760
 And the bridge could sway at that frequency

04:33.760 --> 04:35.880
 and the slight sway made pedestrians

04:35.880 --> 04:37.920
 tend a little bit to lock in the step.

04:37.920 --> 04:41.640
 And after a while, the bridge was oscillating back and forth

04:41.640 --> 04:43.920
 on the pedestrians for walking in step to it.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.920
 And you could see it in the movies made out of the bridge.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.560
 And the engineers made a simple mind at a mistake.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.960
 They had assumed when you walk,

04:51.960 --> 04:56.360
 it's step, step, step, and it's back and forth motion.

04:56.360 --> 04:58.720
 But when you walk, it's also right foot left

04:58.720 --> 05:00.240
 with side to side motion.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.680
 It's the side to side motion

05:01.680 --> 05:04.440
 for which the bridge was strong enough,

05:04.440 --> 05:08.200
 but it wasn't stiff enough.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.000
 And as a result, you would feel the motion

05:11.000 --> 05:12.880
 and you'd fall into step with it.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.040
 And people were very uncomfortable with it.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.480
 They closed the bridge for two years

05:16.480 --> 05:18.800
 while they built stiffening for it.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.800
 Now, nerve cells produce action potentials.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.120
 You have a bunch of cells which are loosely coupled together

05:26.120 --> 05:29.360
 producing action potentials of the same rate.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.760
 There'll be some circumstances

05:31.760 --> 05:34.720
 under which these things can lock together.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.920
 Other circumstances in which they won't.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.680
 Well, if they fire together,

05:40.680 --> 05:43.400
 you can be sure that the other cells are gonna notice it.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.960
 So you can make a computational feature out of this

05:45.960 --> 05:48.840
 in an evolving brain.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.800
 Most artificial neural networks

05:51.800 --> 05:53.560
 don't even have action potentials,

05:53.560 --> 05:56.960
 let alone have the possibility for synchronizing them.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.680
 And you mentioned the evolutionary process.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.360
 So there, the evolutionary process

06:04.360 --> 06:08.040
 that builds on top of biological systems

06:08.040 --> 06:13.040
 leverages that the weird mess of it somehow.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.320
 So how do you make sense of that ability

06:18.320 --> 06:22.040
 to leverage all the different kinds of complexities

06:22.040 --> 06:24.640
 in the biological brain?

06:24.640 --> 06:28.760
 Well, look, in the biological molecule level,

06:29.960 --> 06:31.640
 you have a piece of DNA

06:31.640 --> 06:35.400
 which encodes for a particular protein.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.880
 You could duplicate that piece of DNA

06:37.880 --> 06:41.760
 and now one part of it encodes for that protein,

06:41.760 --> 06:45.080
 but the other one could itself change a little bit

06:45.080 --> 06:46.800
 and thus start coding for a molecule

06:46.800 --> 06:48.520
 which is slightly different.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.320
 Now, that molecule was just slightly different.

06:51.320 --> 06:56.320
 Had a function which helped any old chemical reaction

06:56.320 --> 06:58.120
 was important to the cell.

07:00.640 --> 07:04.520
 You would go ahead and let that evolution

07:04.520 --> 07:06.560
 slowly improve that function.

07:07.520 --> 07:12.520
 And so you have the possibility of duplicating

07:12.800 --> 07:14.760
 and then having things drift apart,

07:14.760 --> 07:16.760
 one of them retain the old function,

07:16.760 --> 07:18.760
 the other one do something new for you.

07:18.760 --> 07:23.760
 And there's evolutionary pressure to improve.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.480
 Look, there isn't in computers too,

07:25.480 --> 07:28.080
 but it's improvement has to do with closing

07:28.080 --> 07:30.360
 some companies and openings of others.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.160
 The evolutionary process looks a little different.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.000
 Yeah.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.560
 Similar timescale, perhaps.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.680
 What's shorter in timescale?

07:39.680 --> 07:42.680
 Companies close, yeah, go bankrupt and are born,

07:42.680 --> 07:45.960
 yeah, shorter, but not much shorter.

07:45.960 --> 07:50.160
 Some company lasts the century, but yeah, you're right.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.200
 I mean, if you think of companies as a single organism

07:53.200 --> 07:55.520
 that builds and you all know, yeah,

07:55.520 --> 08:00.520
 it's a fascinating dual correspondence there

08:00.880 --> 08:02.320
 between biological.

08:02.320 --> 08:06.000
 And companies have difficulty having a new product,

08:06.000 --> 08:08.360
 competing with an old product.

08:08.360 --> 08:12.880
 And when IBM built its first PC,

08:12.880 --> 08:15.000
 you probably read the book,

08:15.000 --> 08:18.920
 they made a little isolated internal unit to make the PC.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.760
 And for the first time in IBM's history,

08:22.760 --> 08:25.960
 they didn't insist that you build it out of IBM components.

08:27.720 --> 08:31.120
 But they understood that they could get into this market,

08:31.120 --> 08:33.240
 which is a very different thing

08:33.240 --> 08:35.760
 by completely changing their culture.

08:38.160 --> 08:43.160
 And biology finds other markets in a more adaptive way.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.600
 In a more adaptive way.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.320
 Yeah, it's better at it.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.320
 It's better at that kind of integration.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.760
 So maybe you've already said it,

08:52.760 --> 08:55.920
 but what to use the most beautiful aspect

08:55.920 --> 08:58.280
 or mechanism of the human mind?

09:01.960 --> 09:04.240
 Is it the adaptive,

09:04.240 --> 09:06.200
 the ability to adapt as you've described?

09:06.200 --> 09:07.680
 Or is there some other little quirk

09:07.680 --> 09:09.320
 that you particularly like?

09:09.320 --> 09:14.320
 Adaptation is everything when you get down to it.

09:16.760 --> 09:21.760
 But the differences between adaptation

09:21.760 --> 09:25.240
 where you're learning goes on only over a generation

09:25.240 --> 09:28.360
 that over evolutionary time,

09:28.360 --> 09:30.760
 where your learning goes on at the time scale

09:30.760 --> 09:34.400
 of one individual who must learn from the environment

09:34.400 --> 09:36.880
 during that individual's lifetime.

09:36.880 --> 09:41.880
 And biology has both kinds of learning in it.

09:43.440 --> 09:47.640
 And the thing which makes neurobiology hard

09:47.640 --> 09:52.640
 is that it's a mathematical system as it were built

09:54.240 --> 09:56.520
 on this other kind of evolutionary system.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.680
 What do you mean by mathematical system?

10:00.680 --> 10:03.600
 Where's the math and the biology?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.320
 Well, when you talk to a computer scientist

10:05.320 --> 10:08.160
 about neural networks, it's all math.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.000
 The fact that biology actually came about

10:11.000 --> 10:14.600
 from evolution and the fact that

10:17.080 --> 10:19.880
 biology is about a system which you can build

10:19.880 --> 10:22.760
 in three dimensions.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.920
 If you look at computer chips,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.520
 computer chips are basically two dimensional structures.

10:31.520 --> 10:36.200
 Maybe 2.1 dimensions, but they really have difficulty

10:36.200 --> 10:39.200
 doing three dimensional wiring.

10:39.200 --> 10:44.200
 Biology is neocortex is actually also sheet like

10:45.800 --> 10:47.680
 and it sits on top of the white matter,

10:47.680 --> 10:50.400
 which is about 10 times the volume of the gray matter

10:50.400 --> 10:53.520
 and contains all what you might call the wires.

10:53.520 --> 10:58.520
 But there's a huge, the effect of computer structure

11:01.800 --> 11:06.080
 on what is easy and what is hard is immense.

11:09.120 --> 11:13.280
 And biology does, it makes some things easy

11:13.280 --> 11:16.040
 that are very difficult to understand

11:16.040 --> 11:17.920
 how to do computationally.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.360
 On the other hand, it can't do simple

11:20.360 --> 11:23.160
 floating point arithmetic, so it's awfully stupid.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.680
 Yeah, and you're saying this kind of three dimensional

11:25.680 --> 11:30.680
 complicated structure makes, it's still math.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.360
 It's still doing math.

11:32.360 --> 11:36.200
 The kind of math is doing enables you to solve problems

11:36.200 --> 11:38.280
 of a very different kind.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.760
 That's right, that's right.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.720
 So you mentioned two kinds of adaptation.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.840
 The evolutionary adaptation and the adaptation

11:46.840 --> 11:50.000
 are learning at the scale of a single human life.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
 Which is particularly beautiful to you

11:56.920 --> 11:59.320
 and interesting from a research

11:59.320 --> 12:01.120
 and from just a human perspective

12:02.160 --> 12:03.600
 and which is more powerful.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.720
 I find things most interesting that I begin to see

12:10.160 --> 12:12.640
 how to get into the edges of them

12:12.640 --> 12:15.400
 and tease them apart a little bit to see how they work.

12:15.400 --> 12:20.400
 And since I can't see the evolutionary process going on,

12:21.760 --> 12:26.760
 I am in awe of it, but I find it just a black hole

12:29.360 --> 12:32.000
 as far as trying to understand what to do.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.240
 And so in a certain sense, I'm in awe of it,

12:35.240 --> 12:37.640
 but I couldn't be interested in working on it.

12:39.520 --> 12:43.880
 The human life's time scale is however a thing

12:43.880 --> 12:47.760
 you can tease apart and study.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.040
 Yeah, you can do it.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.160
 There's developmental neurobiology

12:51.160 --> 12:54.240
 which understands how the connections

12:56.240 --> 12:58.680
 and how the structure evolves

13:00.040 --> 13:03.080
 from a combination of what the genetics is like

13:03.080 --> 13:06.600
 and the real, the fact that you're building a system

13:06.600 --> 13:08.240
 in three dimensions.

13:08.240 --> 13:13.240
 In just days and months, those early days

13:14.400 --> 13:17.200
 of a human life are really interesting.

13:17.200 --> 13:21.120
 They are, and of course, there are times

13:21.120 --> 13:24.280
 of immense cell multiplication.

13:24.280 --> 13:28.120
 There are also times of the greatest cell death

13:28.120 --> 13:30.880
 in the brain is during infancy.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.120
 It's turnover.

13:33.120 --> 13:38.120
 So what is not effective, what is not wired well enough

13:39.760 --> 13:42.800
 to use at the moment, throw it out.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.000
 It's a mysterious process.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.400
 From, let me ask, from what field do you think

13:49.400 --> 13:51.440
 the biggest breakthroughs in understanding

13:51.440 --> 13:56.360
 the mind will come in the next decades?

13:56.360 --> 13:59.640
 Is it neuroscience, computer science, neurobiology,

13:59.640 --> 14:04.640
 psychology, physics, maybe math, maybe literature?

14:09.200 --> 14:10.520
 Well, of course, I see the world

14:10.520 --> 14:12.480
 always through a lens of physics.

14:12.480 --> 14:17.480
 I grew up in physics and the way I pick problems

14:19.000 --> 14:21.760
 is very characteristic of physics

14:21.760 --> 14:23.960
 and of an intellectual background,

14:23.960 --> 14:26.480
 which is not psychology, which is not chemistry

14:26.480 --> 14:28.280
 and so on and so on.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.200
 At both of your parents are physicists.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.960
 Both of my parents were physicists

14:31.960 --> 14:35.160
 and the real thing I got out of that

14:35.160 --> 14:40.160
 was a feeling that the world is an understandable place.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.640
 And if you do enough experiments

14:43.640 --> 14:46.360
 and think about what they mean

14:46.360 --> 14:48.720
 and structure things that you can do,

14:48.720 --> 14:52.480
 the mathematics of the relevant to the experiments,

14:52.480 --> 14:55.080
 you ought to be able to understand how things work.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.920
 But that was, that was a few years ago.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.040
 Did you change your mind at all?

15:01.040 --> 15:06.000
 Through many decades of trying to understand the mind,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.560
 of studying in different kinds of way,

15:07.560 --> 15:09.880
 not even the mind, just biological systems.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.000
 You still have hope that physics that you can understand.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.840
 There's a question of what do you mean by understand?

15:20.840 --> 15:21.680
 Of course.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.480
 When I taught freshman physics, I used to say,

15:24.480 --> 15:26.600
 I wanted to get physics to understand the subject,

15:26.600 --> 15:28.920
 to understand Newton's laws.

15:28.920 --> 15:33.800
 I didn't want them simply to memorize a set of examples

15:33.800 --> 15:36.640
 to which they knew the equations to write down,

15:36.640 --> 15:38.160
 to generate the answers.

15:38.160 --> 15:42.240
 I had this nebulous idea of understanding.

15:42.240 --> 15:45.160
 So that if you looked at a situation, you could say,

15:45.160 --> 15:48.360
 oh, I expect the ball to make that trajectory.

15:48.360 --> 15:52.560
 Or I expect some intuitive notion of understanding.

15:52.560 --> 15:57.560
 And I don't know how to express that very well.

15:58.280 --> 16:01.200
 And I've never known how to express it well.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.960
 And you run smack up against it.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.840
 When you do these, look at these simple neural nets,

16:07.840 --> 16:12.840
 feed forward neural nets, which do amazing things.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.520
 And yet, you know, contain nothing of the essence

16:16.520 --> 16:20.200
 of what I would have felt was understanding.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.040
 Understanding is more than just an enormous lookup table.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.400
 Let's linger on that.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.160
 How sure you are of that?

16:28.160 --> 16:30.320
 What if the table gets really big?

16:31.720 --> 16:34.560
 So, I mean, asks another way,

16:34.560 --> 16:37.120
 these feed forward neural networks,

16:37.120 --> 16:38.960
 do you think they'll ever understand?

16:40.280 --> 16:41.880
 Could answer that in two ways.

16:41.880 --> 16:45.280
 I think if you look at real systems,

16:45.280 --> 16:50.280
 feedback is an essential aspect

16:50.280 --> 16:53.040
 of how these real systems compute.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.520
 On the other hand, if I have a mathematical system

16:55.520 --> 16:58.880
 with feedback, I know I can unlayer this and do it.

16:58.880 --> 17:03.880
 But I have an exponential expansion

17:03.920 --> 17:06.160
 in the amount of stuff I have to build

17:06.160 --> 17:07.960
 if I can solve the problem that way.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.040
 So feedback is essential.

17:10.040 --> 17:14.200
 So we can talk even about recurrent neural recurrence.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.000
 But do you think all the pieces are there

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
 to achieve understanding through these simple mechanisms?

17:22.280 --> 17:25.240
 Like, back to our original question,

17:25.240 --> 17:27.040
 what is the fundamental,

17:27.040 --> 17:28.440
 is there a fundamental difference

17:28.440 --> 17:31.920
 between artificial neural networks and biological?

17:31.920 --> 17:34.680
 Or is it just a bunch of surface stuff?

17:34.680 --> 17:36.520
 Suppose you ask a neurosurgeon,

17:38.080 --> 17:39.520
 when has somebody dead?

17:41.120 --> 17:42.440
 Yeah.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.160
 They'll probably go back to saying,

17:44.160 --> 17:46.720
 well, I can look at the brain rhythms

17:47.960 --> 17:49.240
 and tell you if this is a brain

17:49.240 --> 17:51.320
 which has never got a function again.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.360
 This one is, this other one is one

17:53.360 --> 17:58.200
 is if we treat it well, it's still recoverable.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.640
 And then just do that by some electrodes

18:00.640 --> 18:04.640
 looking at simple electrical patterns.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.080
 Just don't look in any detail at all

18:08.080 --> 18:12.720
 at what individual neurons are doing.

18:12.720 --> 18:17.640
 These rhythms are already absent

18:17.640 --> 18:19.680
 from anything that goes on at Google.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.040
 Yeah, but the rhythms,

18:26.320 --> 18:27.880
 but the rhythms what?

18:27.880 --> 18:30.120
 So, well, that's like comparing,

18:30.120 --> 18:32.920
 okay, I'll tell you, it's like you're comparing

18:32.920 --> 18:37.920
 the greatest classical musician in the world

18:38.520 --> 18:41.120
 to a child first learning to play.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.600
 The question, but they're still both playing the piano.

18:44.600 --> 18:48.760
 I'm asking, is there, will it ever go on at Google?

18:49.800 --> 18:51.040
 Do you have a hope?

18:51.040 --> 18:53.640
 Because you're one of the seminal figures

18:53.640 --> 18:56.720
 in both launching both disciplines,

18:56.720 --> 18:58.840
 both sides of the river.

18:58.840 --> 19:03.840
 I think it's going to go on generation after generation

19:05.560 --> 19:09.200
 the way it has where what you might call

19:09.200 --> 19:11.840
 the AI computer science community says,

19:12.840 --> 19:14.040
 let's take the following.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.920
 This is our model of neurobiology at the moment.

19:16.920 --> 19:20.480
 Let's pretend it's good enough

19:20.480 --> 19:22.440
 and do everything we can with it.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.920
 And it does interesting things.

19:25.920 --> 19:30.360
 And after the while, it sort of grinds into the sand

19:30.360 --> 19:34.160
 and you say, oh, something else is needed

19:34.160 --> 19:37.160
 for neurobiology and some other grand thing comes in

19:38.360 --> 19:41.080
 and enables you to go a lot further.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.280
 What will go into the sand again?

19:44.280 --> 19:46.160
 And I think there couldn't be generations

19:46.160 --> 19:47.360
 of this evolution.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.840
 I don't know how many of them

19:48.840 --> 19:50.880
 and each one is going to get you further

19:50.880 --> 19:55.880
 into what a brain does and in some sense

19:56.680 --> 20:01.680
 past the Turing test longer and more broad aspects.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.120
 And how many of these are there

20:07.120 --> 20:08.960
 are going to have to be before you say,

20:10.360 --> 20:12.760
 I've made something, I've made a human.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.320
 I don't know.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.440
 But your senses, it might be a couple.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.560
 My senses might be a couple more.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.720
 Yeah.

20:20.720 --> 20:25.720
 And going back to my brainwaves, as it were.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.760
 Yes.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.800
 From the AI point of view,

20:31.800 --> 20:36.040
 if they would say, ah, maybe these are an debut phenomenon

20:36.040 --> 20:37.600
 and not important at all.

20:40.440 --> 20:45.080
 The first car I had, a real wreck of a 1936 Dodge,

20:45.080 --> 20:50.080
 go above about 45 miles an hour and the wheels would shimmy.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.640
 Yeah.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.800
 Good, good speedometer that.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.840
 Now, don't be designed at the car that way.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.120
 The car is malfunctioning to have that.

21:02.120 --> 21:05.920
 But in biology, if it were useful to know,

21:05.920 --> 21:08.520
 when are you going more than 45 miles an hour?

21:08.520 --> 21:10.160
 You just capture that

21:10.160 --> 21:15.160
 and you wouldn't worry about where it came from.

21:15.640 --> 21:16.480
 Yeah.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.040
 It's going to be a long time before that kind of thing,

21:19.040 --> 21:24.040
 which can take place in large complex networks of things,

21:25.320 --> 21:27.760
 is actually used in the computation.

21:27.760 --> 21:32.200
 Look, the, how many transistors are there

21:32.200 --> 21:33.800
 at your laptop these days?

21:34.920 --> 21:36.480
 Actually, I don't know the number.

21:36.480 --> 21:39.080
 It's on the scale of 10 to the 10.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.720
 I can't remember the number either.

21:40.720 --> 21:41.560
 Yeah, yeah.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.840
 And all the transistors are somewhat similar

21:45.840 --> 21:50.000
 and most physical systems with that many parts,

21:50.000 --> 21:54.280
 all of which are similar, have collective properties.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.400
 Yes.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.760
 Sound waves and air, earthquakes,

21:57.760 --> 22:00.480
 what have you have collective properties, weather.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.440
 There are no collective properties used

22:05.440 --> 22:09.520
 in artificial neural networks, in AI.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.320
 Yeah, it's very...

22:12.320 --> 22:14.480
 If biology uses them,

22:14.480 --> 22:16.720
 it's going to take us to more generations of things

22:16.720 --> 22:19.120
 to further people to actually dig in

22:19.120 --> 22:21.520
 and see how they are used and what they mean.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.400
 See, you're very right.

22:25.400 --> 22:28.960
 You might have to return several times to neurobiology

22:28.960 --> 22:33.000
 and try to make our transistors more messy.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.080
 Yeah, yeah.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.320
 At the same time, the simple ones

22:36.320 --> 22:40.520
 will conquer big aspects.

22:42.560 --> 22:46.760
 And I think one of the most biggest surprises to me was

22:50.200 --> 22:54.040
 how well learning systems are manifestly nonbiological,

22:55.280 --> 22:57.480
 how important they can be actually

22:57.480 --> 23:01.240
 and how important and how useful they can be in AI.

23:01.240 --> 23:06.240
 So, if we can just take a stroll to some of your work

23:07.920 --> 23:10.320
 that is incredibly surprising,

23:10.320 --> 23:11.800
 that it works as well as it does,

23:11.800 --> 23:15.800
 that launched a lot of the recent work with neural networks.

23:15.800 --> 23:21.800
 If we go to what are now called Hopfield Networks,

23:23.640 --> 23:27.440
 can you tell me what is associative memory in the mind

23:27.440 --> 23:28.840
 for the human side?

23:28.840 --> 23:31.280
 Let's explore memory for a bit.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.040
 Okay, what do you mean by associative memory is,

23:35.320 --> 23:39.320
 you have a memory of each of your friends.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.680
 Your friend has all kinds of properties

23:41.680 --> 23:42.520
 from what they look like,

23:42.520 --> 23:43.920
 what their voice sounds like,

23:43.920 --> 23:45.480
 to where they went to college,

23:45.480 --> 23:49.240
 where you met them, go on and on,

23:49.240 --> 23:52.200
 what science papers they've written.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.520
 And if I start talking about

23:55.520 --> 24:00.520
 a five foot 10 wire rated cognitive scientist

24:02.200 --> 24:04.200
 that's got a very bad back,

24:04.200 --> 24:06.360
 it doesn't take very long for you to say,

24:06.360 --> 24:08.240
 oh, he's talking about Jeff Hinton.

24:08.240 --> 24:13.240
 I never mentioned the name or anything very particular,

24:15.000 --> 24:18.360
 but somehow a few facts that are associated

24:18.360 --> 24:22.200
 with a particular person enables you to get

24:22.200 --> 24:25.640
 hold of the rest of the facts, or not the rest of them,

24:25.640 --> 24:27.560
 another subset of them.

24:27.560 --> 24:32.560
 And it's this ability to link things together,

24:33.440 --> 24:35.560
 link experiences together,

24:36.560 --> 24:40.560
 which goes on to the general name of associative memory.

24:40.560 --> 24:44.000
 And a large part of intelligent behavior

24:44.000 --> 24:47.840
 is actually just large associative memories at work,

24:47.840 --> 24:49.160
 as far as I can see.

24:49.160 --> 24:52.280
 What do you think is the mechanism

24:52.280 --> 24:54.720
 of how it works in the mind?

24:54.720 --> 24:57.880
 Is it a mystery to you still?

24:59.280 --> 25:03.280
 Do you have inklings of how this essential thing

25:03.280 --> 25:05.040
 for cognition works?

25:06.240 --> 25:11.240
 What I made 35 years ago was, of course,

25:11.440 --> 25:15.360
 a crude physics model to show the kind of

25:15.360 --> 25:20.360
 to actually enable you to understand

25:23.000 --> 25:25.160
 my old sense of understanding as a physicist,

25:25.160 --> 25:27.760
 because you could say, ah, I understand

25:27.760 --> 25:29.520
 why this goes to stable states.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.600
 It's like things going downhill.

25:32.600 --> 25:33.920
 Right.

25:33.920 --> 25:37.840
 And that gives you something with which to think

25:39.040 --> 25:42.680
 in physical terms, rather than only in mathematical terms.

25:42.680 --> 25:46.440
 So you've created these associative artificial,

25:46.440 --> 25:47.280
 you know, that works.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.280
 That's right.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.600
 And now if you look at what I did,

25:53.680 --> 25:58.680
 I didn't at all describe a system which gracefully learns.

25:59.160 --> 26:02.480
 I described a system in which you could understand

26:02.480 --> 26:06.000
 how learning could link things together,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.080
 how very crudely it might learn.

26:09.720 --> 26:12.520
 One of the things which intrigues me is I reinvestigate

26:12.520 --> 26:17.520
 that this now, to some extent, is look, I see you,

26:20.320 --> 26:25.320
 I'll see you every second for the next hour or what have you.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.840
 Each look at you is a little bit different.

26:28.840 --> 26:33.080
 I don't store all those second by second images.

26:33.080 --> 26:34.720
 I don't store 3,000 images.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.200
 I somehow compact this information.

26:37.200 --> 26:42.200
 So I now have a view of you which I can use.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.320
 It doesn't slavishly remember anything in particular,

26:49.320 --> 26:53.040
 but it compacts the information into useful chunks

26:53.040 --> 26:56.880
 which are somehow, it's these chunks

26:56.880 --> 26:59.920
 which are not just activities of neurons,

26:59.920 --> 27:01.880
 bigger things than that,

27:01.880 --> 27:07.200
 which are the real entities which are useful to you.

27:07.200 --> 27:12.200
 Useful to you to describe, to compress this information.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.040
 And you have to compress it in such a way

27:15.040 --> 27:19.400
 that if the information comes in just like this again,

27:19.400 --> 27:24.400
 I don't bother to rewrite it or efforts to rewrite it.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.720
 Simply do not yield anything

27:26.720 --> 27:29.760
 because those things are already written.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.840
 And that needs to be, not look this up,

27:32.840 --> 27:36.240
 as if I started somewhere already.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.880
 There has to be something which is much more automatic

27:39.880 --> 27:41.920
 in the machine hardware.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.800
 Right, so in the human mind,

27:44.800 --> 27:48.040
 how complicated is that process, do you think?

27:48.040 --> 27:51.960
 So you've created, feels weird to be sitting

27:51.960 --> 27:55.000
 with John Hopfield calling him Hopfield Networks, but...

27:55.000 --> 27:55.840
 It is weird.

27:55.840 --> 28:00.640
 Yeah, but nevertheless, that's what everyone calls him.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.920
 So here we are.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.000
 So that's a simplification.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.760
 That's what a physicist would do.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.480
 You and Richard Feynman sat down

28:08.480 --> 28:10.000
 and talked about associative memory.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.520
 Now, as a, if you look at the mind

28:14.520 --> 28:18.240
 where you can't quite simplify it so perfectly, do you...

28:18.240 --> 28:21.920
 Well, let me back track just a little bit.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.000
 Yeah.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.080
 Biology is about dynamical systems.

28:27.080 --> 28:31.240
 Computers are dynamical systems.

28:31.240 --> 28:35.080
 You can ask, if you're about to math,

28:35.080 --> 28:39.440
 the model biology, if you want to model neurobiology,

28:39.440 --> 28:40.920
 what is the time scale?

28:40.920 --> 28:46.160
 There's a dynamical system in which of a fairly fast time

28:46.160 --> 28:47.440
 scale in which you could say,

28:47.440 --> 28:50.520
 the synaptes don't change much during this computation.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.800
 So think of the synaptes as fixed

28:52.800 --> 28:56.000
 and just do the dynamics of the activity.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.720
 Or you can say, the synaptes are changing fast enough

29:00.720 --> 29:03.200
 that I have to have the synaptic dynamics

29:03.200 --> 29:06.880
 working at the same time as the system dynamics

29:06.880 --> 29:09.480
 in order to understand the biology.

29:13.280 --> 29:16.200
 Most are, if you look at the feedforward artificial neural

29:16.200 --> 29:20.200
 nets, they're all done as learnings.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.080
 First of all, I spent some time learning,

29:22.080 --> 29:26.560
 not performing, and I turned off learning and I performed.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.680
 Right.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.960
 That's not biology.

29:30.960 --> 29:34.680
 And so as I look more deeply at neurobiology,

29:34.680 --> 29:37.200
 even as an associative memory, I've

29:37.200 --> 29:40.400
 got to face the fact that the dynamics of a synapse change

29:40.400 --> 29:44.600
 is going on all the time.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.280
 And I can't just get by by saying,

29:46.280 --> 29:52.520
 I'll do the dynamics of activity with fixed synapses.

29:52.520 --> 29:56.040
 So the synaptic, the dynamics of the synapses

29:56.040 --> 29:58.160
 is actually fundamental to the whole system.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.920
 Yeah, yeah.

29:59.920 --> 30:04.720
 And there's nothing necessarily separating the time scales.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.520
 When the time scales can be separated,

30:06.520 --> 30:09.280
 it's neat from the physicists of the mathematicians

30:09.280 --> 30:10.760
 point of view.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.640
 But it's not necessarily true in neurobiology.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.760
 See, you're kind of dancing beautifully

30:16.760 --> 30:20.240
 between showing a lot of respect to physics

30:20.240 --> 30:24.720
 and then also saying that physics cannot quite

30:24.720 --> 30:29.600
 reach the complexity of biology.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.640
 So where do you land?

30:30.640 --> 30:33.320
 Or do you continuously dance between the two points?

30:33.320 --> 30:34.920
 I continuously dance between them

30:34.920 --> 30:39.760
 because my whole notion of understanding

30:39.760 --> 30:42.960
 is that you can describe to somebody else

30:42.960 --> 30:48.920
 how something works in ways which are honest and believable

30:48.920 --> 30:55.200
 and still not describe all the nuts and bolts in detail.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.880
 Weather.

30:56.880 --> 31:03.680
 I can describe weather as 10 to the 32 molecules

31:03.680 --> 31:05.480
 colliding in the atmosphere.

31:05.480 --> 31:08.440
 I can simulate weather that way or have a big enough machine.

31:08.440 --> 31:09.920
 I'll simulate it accurately.

31:09.920 --> 31:14.920
 It's no good for understanding.

31:14.920 --> 31:18.440
 If I want to understand things, I want to understand things

31:18.440 --> 31:21.920
 in terms of wind patterns, hurricanes, pressure

31:21.920 --> 31:23.320
 differentials, and so on.

31:23.320 --> 31:27.000
 All things as they're collective.

31:27.000 --> 31:32.200
 And the physicists in me always hopes

31:32.200 --> 31:34.840
 that biology will have some things which

31:34.840 --> 31:38.320
 can be said about it which are both true and for which you

31:38.320 --> 31:41.560
 don't need all the molecular details of the molecules

31:41.560 --> 31:43.560
 colliding.

31:43.560 --> 31:46.640
 That's what I mean from the roots of physics

31:46.640 --> 31:49.200
 by understanding.

31:49.200 --> 31:53.040
 So what did, again, sorry, but Hopfield Networks

31:53.040 --> 31:54.720
 help you understand?

31:54.720 --> 32:01.560
 What insight did it give us about memory, about learning?

32:01.560 --> 32:05.640
 They didn't give insights about learning.

32:05.640 --> 32:10.200
 They gave insights about how things having learned

32:10.200 --> 32:12.440
 could be expressed.

32:12.440 --> 32:17.600
 How having learned a picture of you

32:17.600 --> 32:23.080
 reminds me of your name, but it didn't describe

32:23.080 --> 32:27.960
 a reasonable way of actually doing the learning.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.480
 They only said if you had previously

32:29.480 --> 32:34.040
 learned the connections of this kind of pattern

32:34.040 --> 32:39.080
 would now be able to behave in a physical way with the day

32:39.080 --> 32:41.960
 off with part of the pattern in here,

32:41.960 --> 32:45.840
 the other part of the pattern will complete over here.

32:45.840 --> 32:49.040
 I could understand that physics if the right learning

32:49.040 --> 32:51.360
 stuff had already been put in.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.600
 And it could understand why then putting in a picture

32:53.600 --> 32:57.640
 of somebody else would generate something else over here.

32:57.640 --> 33:01.840
 But it did not have a reasonable description

33:01.840 --> 33:03.800
 of the learning process.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.000
 But even if we get learning, that's

33:06.000 --> 33:12.200
 just a powerful concept that forming representations that

33:12.200 --> 33:17.400
 are useful to be robust for error correction kind of thing.

33:17.400 --> 33:20.800
 So this is kind of what the biology does

33:20.800 --> 33:23.280
 that we're talking about.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.400
 What my paper did was simply enable you.

33:26.400 --> 33:34.000
 There are lots of ways of being robust.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.400
 If you think of a dynamical system,

33:36.400 --> 33:42.040
 you think of a system where a path is going on in time.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.000
 And if you think of a computer, there's

33:44.000 --> 33:48.080
 a computational path which is going on in a huge dimensional

33:48.080 --> 33:51.640
 space of 1s and 0s.

33:51.640 --> 33:55.720
 And an error correction system is a system

33:55.720 --> 33:58.680
 which, if you get a little bit off that trajectory,

33:58.680 --> 34:00.960
 will push you back onto that trajectory again.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.120
 So you get to the same answer in spite of the fact

34:03.120 --> 34:06.560
 that there were things that the computation wasn't being

34:06.560 --> 34:10.880
 ideally done all the way along the line.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.560
 And there are lots of models for error correction.

34:13.560 --> 34:15.520
 But one of the models for error correction

34:15.520 --> 34:19.400
 is to say there's a valley that you're following

34:19.400 --> 34:20.720
 flowing down.

34:20.720 --> 34:23.960
 And if you push a little bit off the valley,

34:23.960 --> 34:26.680
 just like water being pushed a little bit by a rock,

34:26.680 --> 34:30.080
 it gets back and follows the course of the river.

34:30.080 --> 34:37.680
 And that, basically, the analog in the physical system

34:37.680 --> 34:42.080
 which enables you to say, oh, yes, error free computation

34:42.080 --> 34:45.560
 and an associative memory are very much like things

34:45.560 --> 34:47.920
 that I can understand from point of view

34:47.920 --> 34:50.240
 of a physical system.

34:50.240 --> 34:54.520
 The physical system can be, under some circumstances,

34:54.520 --> 34:58.160
 an accurate metaphor.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.480
 It's not the only metaphor.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.920
 There are error correction schemes

35:01.920 --> 35:06.800
 which don't have a valley and energy behind them.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.080
 But those are error correction schemes

35:09.080 --> 35:11.240
 which a mathematician may be able to understand,

35:11.240 --> 35:13.840
 but I don't.

35:13.840 --> 35:18.880
 So there's the physical metaphor that seems to work here.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.600
 That's right.

35:20.600 --> 35:24.800
 So these kinds of networks actually

35:24.800 --> 35:28.400
 led to a lot of the work that is going on now

35:28.400 --> 35:30.840
 in neural networks, artificial neural networks.

35:30.840 --> 35:34.800
 So the follow on work with the restricted Boltzmann machines

35:34.800 --> 35:40.720
 and deep belief nets followed on from these ideas

35:40.720 --> 35:41.760
 of the Hopfield network.

35:41.760 --> 35:46.760
 So what do you think about this continued progress

35:46.760 --> 35:51.880
 of that work towards now revigorated exploration

35:51.880 --> 35:55.720
 of feedforward neural networks and recurrent neural networks

35:55.720 --> 35:57.280
 and convolutional neural networks

35:57.280 --> 36:02.480
 and kinds of networks that are helping solve image recognition,

36:02.480 --> 36:05.920
 natural language processing, all that kind of stuff?

36:05.920 --> 36:09.720
 It always intrigued me that one of the most long lived

36:09.720 --> 36:14.440
 of the learning systems is the Boltzmann machine, which

36:14.440 --> 36:18.920
 is intrinsically a feedback network.

36:18.920 --> 36:24.440
 And with the brilliance of Hinden and Sinovsky

36:24.440 --> 36:28.200
 to understand how to do learning in that,

36:28.200 --> 36:30.760
 and it's still a useful way to understand learning

36:30.760 --> 36:34.760
 and understand, and the learning that you understand in that

36:34.760 --> 36:37.880
 has something to do with the way that feedforward systems

36:37.880 --> 36:41.560
 work, but it's not always exactly simple

36:41.560 --> 36:45.760
 to express that intuition.

36:45.760 --> 36:49.680
 But it always amuses me to see Hinden going back

36:49.680 --> 36:53.280
 to the will yet again on a form of the Boltzmann machine,

36:53.280 --> 36:59.920
 because really that which has feedback and interesting

36:59.920 --> 37:03.800
 probabilities in it is a lovely encapsulation

37:03.800 --> 37:07.640
 of something computational.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.160
 Something computational?

37:10.160 --> 37:12.120
 Something both computational and physical.

37:12.120 --> 37:15.320
 Computational, and it's very much related

37:15.320 --> 37:17.400
 to feedforward networks.

37:17.400 --> 37:21.720
 Physical in that Boltzmann machine learning

37:21.720 --> 37:24.840
 is really learning a set of parameters

37:24.840 --> 37:29.640
 for a physics, Hamiltonian, or energy function.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.440
 What do you think about learning in this whole domain?

37:32.440 --> 37:39.960
 Do you think the F4 mentioned guy, Jeff Hinton,

37:39.960 --> 37:42.000
 all the work there with back propagation,

37:42.000 --> 37:49.600
 all the kind of learning that goes on in these networks,

37:49.600 --> 37:53.280
 if we compare it to learning in the brain, for example,

37:53.280 --> 37:55.520
 is there echoes of the same kind of power

37:55.520 --> 37:59.880
 that back propagation reveals about these kinds

37:59.880 --> 38:03.000
 of recurrent networks, or is it something fundamentally

38:03.000 --> 38:10.240
 different going on in the brain?

38:10.240 --> 38:13.880
 I don't think the brain is as deep

38:13.880 --> 38:19.280
 as the deepest networks go, the deepest computer science

38:19.280 --> 38:22.120
 networks.

38:22.120 --> 38:24.880
 And I do wonder whether part of that depth of the computer

38:24.880 --> 38:28.920
 science networks is necessitated by the fact

38:28.920 --> 38:33.200
 that the only learning that's easily done on a machine

38:33.200 --> 38:36.240
 is feedforward.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.520
 And so there is the question of, to what extent

38:39.520 --> 38:46.040
 is the biology, which has some feedforward and some feedback,

38:46.040 --> 38:51.560
 been captured by something which has got many more neurons,

38:51.560 --> 38:56.400
 but much more depth than the neurons in it?

38:56.400 --> 39:00.240
 So part of you wonders if the feedback is actually

39:00.240 --> 39:03.680
 more essential than the number of neurons or the depth,

39:03.680 --> 39:06.400
 the dynamics of the feedback.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.960
 The dynamics of the feedback, look,

39:08.960 --> 39:13.040
 if you don't have feedback, it's a little bit like a building,

39:13.040 --> 39:17.800
 a big computer, and running it through one clock cycle.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.200
 And then you can't do anything.

39:19.200 --> 39:24.760
 Do you reload something coming in?

39:24.760 --> 39:26.680
 How do you use the fact that there

39:26.680 --> 39:28.160
 are multiple clocks like that?

39:28.160 --> 39:30.720
 How do I use the fact that you can close your eyes,

39:30.720 --> 39:33.800
 stop listening to me, and think about a chess board

39:33.800 --> 39:38.560
 for two minutes without any input whatsoever?

39:38.560 --> 39:42.680
 Yeah, that memory thing.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.960
 That's fundamentally a feedback kind of mechanism.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.480
 You're going back to something.

39:47.480 --> 39:51.960
 Yes, it's hard to understand.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.920
 It's hard to introspect.

39:53.920 --> 39:57.360
 Let alone consciousness.

39:57.360 --> 40:01.040
 Oh, let alone consciousness, yes, yes.

40:01.040 --> 40:02.440
 Because that's tied up in there, too.

40:02.440 --> 40:06.880
 You can't just put that on another shelf.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.720
 Every once in a while, I get interested in consciousness,

40:09.720 --> 40:12.760
 and then I go and I've done that for years

40:12.760 --> 40:17.080
 and ask one of my betters, as it were,

40:17.080 --> 40:18.640
 their view on consciousness.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.880
 It's been interesting collecting them.

40:21.880 --> 40:25.240
 What is consciousness?

40:25.240 --> 40:30.200
 Let's try to take a brief step into that room.

40:30.200 --> 40:33.680
 Well, I asked Marvin Minsky, as you go on consciousness.

40:33.680 --> 40:40.480
 And Marvin said, consciousness is basically overrated.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.840
 It may be an epiphenomenon.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.560
 After all, all the things your brain does,

40:46.560 --> 40:55.680
 these are actually hard computations you do unconsciously.

40:55.680 --> 41:00.840
 And there's so much evidence that even the simple things you do,

41:00.840 --> 41:05.680
 you can make committed decisions about them.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.240
 The neurobiologist can say, he's now committed.

41:08.240 --> 41:14.760
 He's going to move the hand left before you know it.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.760
 So his view that consciousness is not,

41:16.760 --> 41:19.320
 that's just like little icing on the cake.

41:19.320 --> 41:21.360
 The real cake is in the subconscious.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.920
 Yeah, yeah.

41:22.920 --> 41:24.920
 Subconscious, nonconscious.

41:24.920 --> 41:27.480
 Nonconscious, that's the better word, sir.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.640
 It's only that Freud captured the other word.

41:29.640 --> 41:33.040
 Yeah, it's a confusing word, subconscious.

41:33.040 --> 41:38.000
 Nicholas Chater wrote an interesting book.

41:38.000 --> 41:46.720
 I think the title of it is The Mind is Flat.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.280
 In an neural net sense, it might be

41:49.280 --> 41:53.320
 flat as something which is a very broad neural net

41:53.320 --> 41:56.240
 without really any layers in depth,

41:56.240 --> 42:00.800
 or as a deep brain would be many layers and not so broad.

42:00.800 --> 42:05.080
 In the same sense that if you pushed Minsky hard enough,

42:05.080 --> 42:08.840
 he would probably have said, consciousness

42:08.840 --> 42:12.800
 is your effort to explain to yourself

42:12.800 --> 42:16.960
 that which you have already done.

42:16.960 --> 42:20.040
 Yeah, it's the weaving of the narrative

42:20.040 --> 42:23.760
 around the things that already been computed for you.

42:23.760 --> 42:24.320
 That's right.

42:24.320 --> 42:29.840
 And so much of what we do for our memories of events,

42:29.840 --> 42:35.720
 for example, if there's some traumatic event, you witness,

42:35.720 --> 42:39.560
 you will have a few facts about it correctly done.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.520
 If somebody asks you about it, you

42:41.520 --> 42:43.960
 will weave a narrative which is actually

42:43.960 --> 42:47.200
 much more rich in detail than that.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.600
 Based on some anchor points you have of correct things

42:50.600 --> 42:53.840
 and pulling together general knowledge on the other,

42:53.840 --> 42:56.680
 but you will have a narrative.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.280
 And once you generate that narrative,

42:58.280 --> 43:00.800
 you are very likely to repeat that narrative

43:00.800 --> 43:02.920
 and claim that all the things you have in it

43:02.920 --> 43:05.040
 are actually the correct things.

43:05.040 --> 43:12.000
 There was a marvelous example of that in the Watergate

43:12.000 --> 43:16.760
 slash impeachment era of John Dean.

43:16.760 --> 43:19.880
 John Dean, you're too young to know,

43:19.880 --> 43:23.480
 had been the personal lawyer of Nixon.

43:23.480 --> 43:26.360
 And so John Dean was involved in the cover up.

43:26.360 --> 43:29.640
 And John Dean ultimately realized

43:29.640 --> 43:32.840
 the only way to keep himself out of jail for a long time

43:32.840 --> 43:36.080
 was actually to tell some of the truths about Nixon.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.360
 And John Dean was a tremendous witness.

43:38.360 --> 43:41.600
 He would remember these conversations

43:41.600 --> 43:46.640
 in great detail and very convincing detail.

43:46.640 --> 43:52.240
 And long afterward, some of the techniques

43:52.240 --> 43:55.880
 of some of the tapes, the secret tapes

43:55.880 --> 44:01.600
 from which John Dean was recalling these conversations

44:01.600 --> 44:03.200
 were published.

44:03.200 --> 44:05.400
 And one found out that John Dean had a good,

44:05.400 --> 44:07.160
 but not exceptional memory.

44:07.160 --> 44:11.640
 What he had was an ability to paint vividly and in some sense

44:11.640 --> 44:16.920
 accurately the tone of what was going on.

44:16.920 --> 44:18.680
 By the way, that's a beautiful description

44:18.680 --> 44:23.240
 of consciousness.

44:23.240 --> 44:32.520
 Do you, like, where do you stand in your today?

44:32.520 --> 44:34.600
 So perhaps it changes day to day,

44:34.600 --> 44:37.720
 but where do you stand on the importance of consciousness

44:37.720 --> 44:42.120
 in our whole big mess of cognition?

44:42.120 --> 44:45.760
 Is it just a little narrative maker?

44:45.760 --> 44:51.280
 Or is it actually fundamental to intelligence?

44:51.280 --> 44:56.120
 That's a very hard one.

44:56.120 --> 45:00.640
 When I asked Francis Crick about consciousness,

45:00.640 --> 45:04.000
 he launched forward a long monologue about Mendel

45:04.000 --> 45:08.680
 and the peas and how Mendel knew that there was something.

45:08.680 --> 45:11.480
 And how biologists understood that there was something

45:11.480 --> 45:16.280
 in inheritance, which was just very, very different.

45:16.280 --> 45:19.880
 And the fact that inherited traits

45:19.880 --> 45:25.000
 didn't just wash out into a gray, but were this or this

45:25.000 --> 45:27.960
 and propagated.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.680
 But that was absolutely fundamental to biology.

45:30.680 --> 45:33.400
 And it took generations of biologists

45:33.400 --> 45:36.240
 to understand that there was genetics.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.000
 And it took another generation or two

45:38.000 --> 45:42.040
 to understand that genetics came from DNA.

45:42.040 --> 45:48.000
 But very shortly after Mendel, thinking biologists did realize

45:48.000 --> 45:50.440
 that there was a deep problem about inheritance.

45:54.720 --> 45:58.240
 And Francis would have liked to have said,

45:58.240 --> 46:01.480
 and that's why I'm working on consciousness.

46:01.480 --> 46:03.560
 But of course, he didn't have any smoking

46:03.560 --> 46:08.520
 gun in the sense of Mendel.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.600
 And that's the weakness of his position.

46:10.600 --> 46:16.040
 If you read his book, which he wrote with Koch, I think.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.000
 Yeah, Christoph Koch, yeah.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.440
 I find it unconvincing for the smoking gun reason.

46:27.520 --> 46:30.520
 So I go on collecting views without actually having taken

46:30.520 --> 46:32.640
 a very strong one myself.

46:32.640 --> 46:35.320
 Because I haven't seen the entry point.

46:35.320 --> 46:38.840
 Not seeing the smoking gun from the point of view of physics.

46:38.840 --> 46:41.160
 I don't see the entry point.

46:41.160 --> 46:43.640
 Whereas in neurobiology, once I understood

46:43.640 --> 46:49.080
 the idea of a collective evolution of dynamics, which

46:49.080 --> 46:52.200
 could be described as a collective phenomenon,

46:52.200 --> 46:55.000
 I thought, ah, there's a point where

46:55.000 --> 46:57.680
 what I know about physics is so different

46:57.680 --> 46:59.760
 from any neurobiologist that I have something

46:59.760 --> 47:01.760
 that I might be able to contribute.

47:01.760 --> 47:04.640
 And right now, there's no way to grasp

47:04.640 --> 47:07.680
 a consciousness from a physics perspective.

47:07.680 --> 47:11.480
 From my point of view, that's correct.

47:11.480 --> 47:16.680
 And of course, people, physicists, like everybody else,

47:16.680 --> 47:18.400
 they think very muddly about things.

47:18.400 --> 47:23.760
 You have the closely related question about free will.

47:23.760 --> 47:27.320
 Do you believe you have free will?

47:27.320 --> 47:30.160
 Physicists will give an offhand answer,

47:30.160 --> 47:32.600
 and then backtrack, backtrack, backtrack,

47:32.600 --> 47:34.760
 where they realize that the answer they gave

47:34.760 --> 47:38.480
 must fundamentally contradict the laws of physics.

47:38.480 --> 47:41.080
 Naturally answering questions of free will and consciousness

47:41.080 --> 47:42.760
 naturally lead to contradictions

47:42.760 --> 47:45.800
 from a physics perspective.

47:45.800 --> 47:48.040
 Because it eventually ends up with quantum mechanics,

47:48.040 --> 47:50.440
 and then you get into that whole mess

47:50.440 --> 47:56.680
 of trying to understand how much, from a physics perspective,

47:56.680 --> 47:59.640
 how much is determined, already predetermined,

47:59.640 --> 48:02.360
 how much is already deterministic about our universe.

48:02.360 --> 48:03.440
 And there's lots of different.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.880
 And if you don't push quite that far,

48:05.880 --> 48:09.520
 you can say essentially all of neurobiology,

48:09.520 --> 48:11.480
 which is relevant, can be captured

48:11.480 --> 48:13.360
 by classical equations of motion.

48:16.240 --> 48:19.000
 Because in my view, the mysteries of the brain

48:19.000 --> 48:22.160
 are not the mysteries of quantum mechanics,

48:22.160 --> 48:24.880
 but the mysteries of what can happen

48:24.880 --> 48:28.880
 when you have a dynamical system, driven system,

48:28.880 --> 48:32.280
 with 10 of the 14 parts.

48:32.280 --> 48:34.520
 That complexity is something which

48:34.520 --> 48:39.680
 is that the physics of complex systems

48:39.680 --> 48:43.960
 is at least as badly understood as the physics of phase

48:43.960 --> 48:46.560
 coherence in quantum mechanics.

48:46.560 --> 48:48.560
 Can we go there for a second?

48:48.560 --> 48:51.760
 You've talked about attractor networks.

48:51.760 --> 48:54.880
 And just maybe you could say, what are attractor networks?

48:54.880 --> 48:58.640
 And more broadly, what are interesting network dynamics

48:58.640 --> 49:02.840
 that emerge in these or other complex systems?

49:05.280 --> 49:08.720
 You have to be willing to think in a huge number of dimensions,

49:08.720 --> 49:11.000
 because in a huge number of dimensions,

49:11.000 --> 49:12.920
 the behavior of a system can be thought

49:12.920 --> 49:15.920
 as just the motion of the point over time

49:15.920 --> 49:17.720
 in this huge number of dimensions.

49:17.720 --> 49:19.400
 All right.

49:19.400 --> 49:21.600
 And an attractor network is simply

49:21.600 --> 49:25.920
 a network where there is a line and other lines

49:25.920 --> 49:28.480
 converge on it in time.

49:28.480 --> 49:31.760
 That's the essence of an attractor network.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.760
 In a highly dimensional space.

49:34.760 --> 49:37.600
 And the easiest way to get that is

49:37.600 --> 49:40.960
 to do it in a high dimensional space, where

49:40.960 --> 49:47.600
 some of the dimensions provide the dissipation, which

49:47.600 --> 49:50.160
 I have a physical system.

49:50.160 --> 49:53.680
 Projectories can't contract everywhere.

49:53.680 --> 49:56.920
 They have to contract in some places and expand in others.

49:56.920 --> 49:59.360
 There's a fundamental classical theorem

49:59.360 --> 50:01.320
 of statistical mechanics, which goes

50:01.320 --> 50:04.840
 under the name of Leoville's theorem, which

50:04.840 --> 50:07.920
 says you can't contract everywhere.

50:07.920 --> 50:12.600
 If you contract somewhere, you expand somewhere else.

50:12.600 --> 50:15.240
 It is an interesting physical systems.

50:15.240 --> 50:19.560
 You get driven systems where you have a small subsystem, which

50:19.560 --> 50:21.720
 is the interesting part.

50:21.720 --> 50:24.080
 And the rest of the contraction and expansion,

50:24.080 --> 50:25.640
 the physicists would say, is entropy

50:25.640 --> 50:27.360
 flow in this other part of the system.

50:30.800 --> 50:33.120
 But basically, attractor networks

50:33.120 --> 50:40.360
 are dynamics funneling down so that you can't be any.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.520
 So that if you start somewhere in the dynamical system,

50:42.520 --> 50:45.400
 you will soon find yourself on a pretty well determined

50:45.400 --> 50:47.120
 pathway, which goes somewhere.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.280
 If you start somewhere else, you'll

50:48.280 --> 50:50.520
 wind up on a different pathway.

50:50.520 --> 50:53.120
 But I don't have just all possible things.

50:53.120 --> 50:56.680
 You have some defined pathways, which are allowed,

50:56.680 --> 50:59.840
 and under which you will converge.

50:59.840 --> 51:01.920
 And that's the way you make a stable computer,

51:01.920 --> 51:03.680
 and that's the way you make a stable behavior.

51:06.280 --> 51:08.760
 So in general, looking at the physics

51:08.760 --> 51:15.200
 of the emergent stability in these networks,

51:15.200 --> 51:17.640
 what are some interesting characteristics

51:17.640 --> 51:20.920
 that what are some interesting insights

51:20.920 --> 51:24.960
 from studying the dynamics of such high dimensional systems?

51:24.960 --> 51:29.880
 Most dynamical systems, most driven dynamical systems,

51:29.880 --> 51:33.200
 by driven they're coupled somehow to an energy source.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.600
 And so if their dynamics keeps going

51:35.600 --> 51:40.080
 because it's coupling to the energy source,

51:40.080 --> 51:42.680
 most of them it's very difficult to understand at all

51:42.680 --> 51:47.720
 with the dynamical behavior is going to be.

51:47.720 --> 51:49.240
 You have to run it.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.600
 You have to run it.

51:50.600 --> 51:53.520
 There's a subset of systems, which

51:53.520 --> 51:57.280
 is what is actually known to the mathematicians

51:57.280 --> 52:00.880
 as a Lyapunov function.

52:00.880 --> 52:05.480
 And those systems, you can understand convergent dynamics

52:05.480 --> 52:10.680
 by saying you're going downhill on something or other.

52:10.680 --> 52:13.560
 And that's what I found with ever knowing

52:13.560 --> 52:17.080
 what the Lyapunov functions were in the simple model

52:17.080 --> 52:20.520
 I made in the early 80s, was that energy functions

52:20.520 --> 52:23.160
 you could understand how you could get this channeling

52:23.160 --> 52:28.080
 on the pathways without having to follow the dynamics

52:28.080 --> 52:31.880
 in infinite detail.

52:31.880 --> 52:34.280
 You started rolling a ball off of a mountain

52:34.280 --> 52:36.480
 that's going to wind up at the bottom of a valley.

52:36.480 --> 52:40.480
 You know that it's true without actually watching

52:40.480 --> 52:43.120
 the ball roll down.

52:43.120 --> 52:45.840
 There's certain properties of the system

52:45.840 --> 52:48.360
 that when you can know that.

52:48.360 --> 52:49.440
 That's right.

52:49.440 --> 52:53.640
 And not all systems behave that way.

52:53.640 --> 52:55.200
 Most don't, probably.

52:55.200 --> 52:55.920
 Both don't.

52:55.920 --> 52:57.680
 But it provides you with a metaphor

52:57.680 --> 53:00.640
 for thinking about systems which are stable

53:00.640 --> 53:03.840
 and who do have these attractors behave,

53:03.840 --> 53:07.880
 even if you can't find the Lyapunov function behind them

53:07.880 --> 53:09.840
 or an energy function behind them.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.480
 It gives you a metaphor for thought.

53:11.480 --> 53:16.480
 Speaking of thought, if I had a glint in my eye

53:19.760 --> 53:23.360
 with excitement and said, you know,

53:23.360 --> 53:25.880
 I'm really excited about this something called

53:25.880 --> 53:28.440
 deep learning and neural networks

53:28.440 --> 53:32.440
 and I would like to create an intelligent system

53:32.440 --> 53:37.440
 and came to you as an advisor, what would you recommend?

53:37.440 --> 53:42.440
 And is it a hopeless pursuit to use neural networks

53:42.880 --> 53:44.080
 to achieve thought?

53:44.960 --> 53:48.760
 Is it, what kind of mechanisms should we explore?

53:48.760 --> 53:50.600
 What kind of ideas should we explore?

53:52.080 --> 53:56.800
 Well, you look at the simple networks,

53:56.800 --> 53:58.200
 one past networks.

54:01.360 --> 54:04.760
 They don't support multiple hypotheses very well.

54:04.760 --> 54:09.760
 As I have tried to work with very simple systems

54:09.960 --> 54:13.000
 which do something which you might consider to be thinking,

54:13.000 --> 54:16.840
 thought has to do with the ability to do mental exploration

54:17.720 --> 54:20.080
 before you take a physical action.

54:22.440 --> 54:25.520
 Almost like we were mentioning playing chess,

54:25.520 --> 54:30.520
 visualizing, simulating inside your head different outcomes.

54:30.520 --> 54:31.360
 Yeah, yeah.

54:31.360 --> 54:36.360
 And now you could do that in a feed forward network

54:37.400 --> 54:40.520
 because you've pre calculated all kinds of things.

54:41.960 --> 54:44.080
 But I think the way neurobiology does it

54:44.080 --> 54:47.840
 hasn't pre calculated everything.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.040
 It actually has parts of a dynamical system

54:52.040 --> 54:57.040
 in which you're doing exploration in a way which is...

54:57.040 --> 55:01.760
 There's a creative element.

55:01.760 --> 55:02.600
 Like there's an...

55:02.600 --> 55:04.680
 There's a creative element.

55:04.680 --> 55:09.680
 And in a simple minded neural net,

55:13.000 --> 55:18.000
 you have a constellation of instances

55:20.080 --> 55:21.360
 from which you've learned.

55:23.040 --> 55:25.840
 And if you are within that space,

55:25.840 --> 55:30.840
 if a new question is a question within this space,

55:31.840 --> 55:36.840
 you can actually rely on that system pretty well

55:36.840 --> 55:39.840
 to come up with a good suggestion for what to do.

55:39.840 --> 55:44.840
 If on the other hand the query comes from outside the space,

55:45.840 --> 55:48.840
 you have no way of knowing how the system is going to behave.

55:48.840 --> 55:50.840
 There are no limitations on what could happen.

55:51.840 --> 55:54.840
 And so the artificial neural net world

55:54.840 --> 55:56.840
 is always very much...

55:56.840 --> 56:00.840
 I have a population of examples.

56:00.840 --> 56:04.840
 The test set must be drawn from this equivalent population.

56:04.840 --> 56:07.840
 The test set has examples which are from a population

56:07.840 --> 56:09.840
 which is completely different.

56:10.840 --> 56:15.840
 There's no way that you could expect to get the answer right.

56:15.840 --> 56:20.840
 What they call outside the distribution.

56:20.840 --> 56:21.840
 That's right.

56:21.840 --> 56:26.840
 And so if you see a ball rolling across the street in dusk,

56:27.840 --> 56:32.840
 if that wasn't in your training set,

56:32.840 --> 56:35.840
 the idea that a child may be coming close behind that

56:35.840 --> 56:38.840
 is not going to occur to the neural net.

56:39.840 --> 56:41.840
 And it is to our...

56:41.840 --> 56:44.840
 There's something in your biology that allows that.

56:44.840 --> 56:45.840
 Yeah.

56:45.840 --> 56:47.840
 There's something in the way of what it means

56:47.840 --> 56:52.840
 to be outside of the population of the training set.

56:52.840 --> 56:54.840
 The population of the training set

56:54.840 --> 56:57.840
 isn't just sort of this set of examples.

57:00.840 --> 57:02.840
 There's more to it than that.

57:02.840 --> 57:05.840
 And it gets back to my question of,

57:05.840 --> 57:08.840
 what is it to understand something?

57:08.840 --> 57:09.840
 Yeah.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.840
 You know, in a small tangent,

57:13.840 --> 57:16.840
 you've talked about the value of thinking

57:16.840 --> 57:20.840
 of deductive reasoning in science versus large data collection.

57:21.840 --> 57:24.840
 So sort of thinking about the problem.

57:24.840 --> 57:26.840
 I suppose it's the physics side of you

57:26.840 --> 57:30.840
 of going back to first principles and thinking.

57:30.840 --> 57:32.840
 But what do you think is the value of deductive reasoning

57:32.840 --> 57:35.840
 in the scientific process?

57:37.840 --> 57:39.840
 Well, they're obviously scientific questions

57:39.840 --> 57:42.840
 in which the root to the answer to it

57:42.840 --> 57:45.840
 comes through the analysis of what hell of a lot of data.

57:45.840 --> 57:46.840
 Right.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.840
 Cosmology, that kind of stuff.

57:50.840 --> 57:55.840
 And that's never been the kind of problem

57:55.840 --> 57:58.840
 in which I've had any particular insight.

57:58.840 --> 58:00.840
 I must say, if you look at...

58:00.840 --> 58:03.840
 Cosmology is one of those.

58:03.840 --> 58:06.840
 If you look at the actual things that Jim Peebles,

58:06.840 --> 58:09.840
 one of this year's Nobel Prize in physics,

58:09.840 --> 58:11.840
 one's from the local physics department,

58:11.840 --> 58:13.840
 the kinds of things he's done,

58:13.840 --> 58:16.840
 he's never crunched large data.

58:16.840 --> 58:18.840
 Never, never, never.

58:18.840 --> 58:21.840
 He's used the encapsulation

58:21.840 --> 58:24.840
 of the work of others in this regard.

58:24.840 --> 58:25.840
 Right.

58:26.840 --> 58:30.840
 But ultimately boiled down to thinking through the problem.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.840
 Like, what are the principles

58:32.840 --> 58:35.840
 under which a particular phenomenon operates?

58:35.840 --> 58:36.840
 Yeah.

58:36.840 --> 58:39.840
 And look, physics is always going to look for ways

58:39.840 --> 58:41.840
 in which you can describe the system

58:41.840 --> 58:46.840
 in a way which rises above the details.

58:46.840 --> 58:52.840
 And to the hard dyed and the wool biologist,

58:52.840 --> 58:55.840
 biology works because of the details.

58:55.840 --> 58:58.840
 And physics, to the physicists,

58:58.840 --> 59:00.840
 we want an explanation which is right

59:00.840 --> 59:02.840
 in spite of the details.

59:02.840 --> 59:05.840
 And there will be questions which we cannot answer as physicists

59:05.840 --> 59:12.840
 because the answer cannot be found that way.

59:12.840 --> 59:14.840
 There's not sure if you're familiar

59:14.840 --> 59:18.840
 with the entire field of brain computer interfaces

59:18.840 --> 59:23.840
 that's become more and more intensely researched

59:23.840 --> 59:24.840
 and developed recently,

59:24.840 --> 59:28.840
 especially with companies like Neuralink with Elon Musk.

59:28.840 --> 59:30.840
 Yeah, I know there have always been the interest

59:30.840 --> 59:35.840
 both in things like getting the eyes

59:35.840 --> 59:37.840
 to be able to control things

59:37.840 --> 59:40.840
 or getting the thought patterns

59:40.840 --> 59:44.840
 to be able to move what had been a connected limb

59:44.840 --> 59:47.840
 which is now connected through a computer.

59:47.840 --> 59:48.840
 That's right.

59:48.840 --> 59:50.840
 So in the case of Neuralink,

59:50.840 --> 59:53.840
 they're doing a thousand plus connections

59:53.840 --> 59:55.840
 where they're able to do two way,

59:55.840 --> 1:00:00.840
 activate and read spikes, neural spikes.

1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:05.840
 Do you have hope for that kind of computer brain interaction

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:08.840
 in the near or maybe even far future

1:00:08.840 --> 1:00:15.840
 of being able to expand the ability of the mind of cognition

1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:19.840
 or understand the mind?

1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:22.840
 It's interesting watching things go

1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:26.840
 when I first became interested in neurobiology.

1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:28.840
 Most of the practitioners thought

1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:30.840
 you would be able to understand neurobiology

1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:34.840
 by techniques which allowed you to record

1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:36.840
 only one cell at a time.

1:00:36.840 --> 1:00:38.840
 One cell, yeah.

1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:42.840
 People like David Hubel

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:46.840
 very strongly reflected that point of view.

1:00:46.840 --> 1:00:49.840
 And that's been taken over by a generation,

1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:52.840
 a couple of generations later,

1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:54.840
 by a set of people who says

1:00:54.840 --> 1:00:56.840
 not until we can record from 10 to the 4

1:00:56.840 --> 1:00:58.840
 or 10 to the 5 at a time

1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:00.840
 will we actually be able to understand

1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:02.840
 how the brain actually works.

1:01:02.840 --> 1:01:06.840
 And in a general sense,

1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:08.840
 I think that's right.

1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:11.840
 You have to begin to be able to look

1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:15.840
 for the collective modes,

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:17.840
 the collective operation of things.

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:19.840
 It doesn't rely on this action

1:01:19.840 --> 1:01:21.840
 and potential of that cell.

1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:23.840
 It relies on the collective properties

1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:25.840
 of this set of cells connected

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:27.840
 with this kind of patterns and so on.

1:01:27.840 --> 1:01:29.840
 And you're not going to succeed

1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:31.840
 in seeing what those collective activities are

1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:37.840
 without recording many cells at once.

1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:39.840
 The question is how many at once?

1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:41.840
 What's the threshold?

1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:43.840
 And that's the...

1:01:43.840 --> 1:01:46.840
 Look, it's being pursued hard

1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:48.840
 in the motor cortex.

1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:50.840
 The motor cortex does something

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:53.840
 which is complex,

1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:55.840
 and yet the problem you're trying to address

1:01:55.840 --> 1:01:59.840
 is fairly simple.

1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:02.840
 Neurobiology does it in ways that are different

1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:04.840
 from the way an engineer would do it.

1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:08.840
 An engineer would put in six highly accurate

1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:10.840
 stepping motors controlling a limb

1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:14.840
 rather than 100,000 muscle fibers,

1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:18.840
 each of which has to be individually controlled.

1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:21.840
 And so understanding how to do things

1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:23.840
 in a way which is much more forgiving

1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:25.840
 and much more neural,

1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:32.840
 I think, would benefit the engineering world.

1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:35.840
 The engineering world touch.

1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:37.840
 Let's put it in a pressure sensor or two,

1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:41.840
 rather than an array of a gazillion pressure sensors,

1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:43.840
 none of which are accurate,

1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:47.840
 all of which are perpetually recalibrating themselves.

1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:50.840
 You're saying your hope is your advice

1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:52.840
 for the engineers of the future

1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:58.840
 is to embrace the large chaos of a messy,

1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:02.840
 error prone system like those of the biological systems.

1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:04.840
 That's probably the way to solve some of these.

1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:09.840
 I think you'll be able to make better computations

1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:15.840
 slash robotics that way than by trying

1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:20.840
 to force things into a robotics where joint motors

1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:24.840
 are powerful and stepping motors are accurate.

1:03:24.840 --> 1:03:27.840
 But then the physicists, the physicists in you

1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:30.840
 will be lost forever in such systems

1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:32.840
 because there's no simple fundamentals

1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:37.840
 to explore in systems that are so large and messy.

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:42.840
 You say that, and yet there's a lot of physics

1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:44.840
 in the Navier Stokes equations,

1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:48.840
 the equations of nonlinear hydrodynamics,

1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:50.840
 huge amount of physics in them.

1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:54.840
 All the physics of atoms and molecules has been lost

1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:57.840
 but has been replaced by this other set of equations

1:03:57.840 --> 1:04:01.840
 which is just as true as the equations at the bottom.

1:04:01.840 --> 1:04:05.840
 Those equations are going to be harder to find

1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:09.840
 in general biology, but the physicist in me

1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:12.840
 says there are probably some equations of that sort.

1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:13.840
 They're out there.

1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:16.840
 They're out there, and if physics is going to

1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:20.840
 contribute anything, it may contribute to trying

1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:22.840
 to find out what those equations are

1:04:22.840 --> 1:04:25.840
 and how to capture them from the biology.

1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:28.840
 Would you say that's one of the main open problems

1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:33.840
 of our age is to discover those equations?

1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:35.840
 Yeah.

1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:38.840
 If you look at, there's molecules

1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:41.840
 and there's psychological behavior,

1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:45.840
 and these two are somehow related.

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:48.840
 There are layers of detail,

1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:50.840
 there are layers of collectiveness,

1:04:50.840 --> 1:04:57.840
 and to capture that in some vague way,

1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:00.840
 several stages on the way up to see how these things

1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:03.840
 can actually be linked together.

1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:07.840
 It seems in our universe there's a lot of

1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:10.840
 elegant equations that can describe the fundamental way

1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:13.840
 that things behave, which is a surprise.

1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:15.840
 It's compressible into equations.

1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:18.840
 It's simple and beautiful.

1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:21.840
 It's still an open question whether that link

1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:26.840
 is equally between molecules and the brain

1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:31.840
 is equally compressible into elegant equations.

1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:36.840
 But you're both a physicist and a dreamer.

1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:38.840
 You have a sense that...

1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:41.840
 Yeah, but I can only dream physics dreams.

1:05:41.840 --> 1:05:43.840
 Physics dreams.

1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:46.840
 There was an interesting book called Einstein's Dreams,

1:05:46.840 --> 1:05:51.840
 which alternates between chapters on his life

1:05:51.840 --> 1:05:56.840
 and descriptions of the way time might have been,

1:05:56.840 --> 1:05:59.840
 but isn't.

1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:02.840
 The linking between these being of course

1:06:02.840 --> 1:06:05.840
 ideas that Einstein might have had

1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:07.840
 to think about the essence of time

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:10.840
 as he was thinking about time.

1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:12.840
 So speaking of the essence of time

1:06:12.840 --> 1:06:16.840
 and your biology, you're one human,

1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:18.840
 famous impactful human,

1:06:18.840 --> 1:06:20.840
 but just one human with a brain

1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:23.840
 living the human condition.

1:06:23.840 --> 1:06:26.840
 But you're ultimately mortal, just like all of us.

1:06:26.840 --> 1:06:29.840
 Has studying the mind as a mechanism

1:06:29.840 --> 1:06:37.840
 changed the way you think about your own mortality?

1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:41.840
 It has really, because particularly as you get older

1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:46.840
 and the body comes apart in various ways,

1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:51.840
 I became much more aware of the fact

1:06:51.840 --> 1:06:58.840
 that what is somebody is contained in the brain

1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:02.840
 and not in the body that you worry about burying.

1:07:02.840 --> 1:07:07.840
 And it is to a certain extent true

1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:12.840
 that for people who write things down, equations,

1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:17.840
 dreams, note beds, diaries,

1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:21.840
 fractions of their thought does continue to live

1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:23.840
 after their dead and gone,

1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:26.840
 after their body is dead and gone.

1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:30.840
 And there's a sea change in that going on

1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:33.840
 in my lifetime between

1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:36.840
 when my father died, except for the things

1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:38.840
 that were actually written by him,

1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:42.840
 as there were very few facts about him

1:07:42.840 --> 1:07:44.840
 that have been recorded,

1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:46.840
 and a number of facts that are recorded

1:07:46.840 --> 1:07:50.840
 about each and every one of us forever now,

1:07:50.840 --> 1:07:54.840
 as far as I can see, in the digital world.

1:07:54.840 --> 1:08:01.840
 And so the whole question of what is death,

1:08:01.840 --> 1:08:04.840
 may be different for people a generation ago

1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:07.840
 and a generation further ahead.

1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:10.840
 We have become immortal under some definitions.

1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:13.840
 Yeah, yeah.

1:08:13.840 --> 1:08:16.840
 Last easy question.

1:08:16.840 --> 1:08:22.840
 What is the meaning of life?

1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:27.840
 Looking back, you've studied the mind,

1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:31.840
 us weird descendants of apes.

1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:38.840
 What's the meaning of our existence on this little earth?

1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:45.840
 Oh, that word meaning is as slippery as the word understand.

1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:51.840
 Interconnected somehow, perhaps.

1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:54.840
 Is there, it's slippery, but is there something

1:08:54.840 --> 1:08:57.840
 that you, despite being slippery,

1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:02.840
 can hold long enough to express?

1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:07.840
 Well, I've been amazed at how hard it is

1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:13.840
 to define the things in a living system

1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:18.840
 in the sense that one hydrogen atom is pretty much like another.

1:09:18.840 --> 1:09:23.840
 But one bacterium is not so much like another bacterium,

1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:25.840
 even of the same nominal species.

1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:28.840
 In fact, the whole notion of what is the species

1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:30.840
 gets a little bit fuzzy.

1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:35.840
 And do species exist in the absence of certain classes of environments?

1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:39.840
 And pretty soon one winds up with the biology

1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:42.840
 which the whole thing is living.

1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:46.840
 But whether there's actually any element of it

1:09:46.840 --> 1:09:50.840
 which by itself would be said to be living

1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:54.840
 becomes a little bit vague in my mind.

1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:57.840
 So in a sense, the idea of meaning

1:09:57.840 --> 1:10:00.840
 is something that's possessed by an individual,

1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:02.840
 like a conscious creature.

1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:06.840
 And you're saying that it's all interconnected

1:10:06.840 --> 1:10:10.840
 in some kind of way that there might not even be an individual,

1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:14.840
 or all kind of this complicated mess of biological systems

1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:16.840
 at all different levels,

1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:20.840
 where the human starts and when the human ends, it's unclear.

1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:23.840
 Yeah, and we're in neurobiology.

1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:27.840
 We're the, oh, you say the neocortex does the thinking,

1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:30.840
 but there's lots of things that are done in the spinal cord.

1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:34.840
 And so we say, what is the essence of thought?

1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:36.840
 Is it just going to be neocortex?

1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:39.840
 Can't be. Can't be.

1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:42.840
 Yeah, maybe to understand and to build thought,

1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:46.840
 you have to build the universe along with the neocortex.

1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:50.840
 It's all interlinked through the spinal cord.

1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:53.840
 John, it's a huge honor talking today.

1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:56.840
 Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it.

 And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom

1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:43.840
 from John Hopfield in his article titled, Now What.

1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:46.840
 Choosing problems is the primary determinant

1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:49.840
 of what one accomplishes in science.

1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:52.840
 I have generally had a relatively short attention span

1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:56.840
 in science problems. Thus, I have always been on the lookout

1:11:56.840 --> 1:11:59.840
 for more interesting questions, either as my present ones

1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:02.840
 get worked out, or as they get classified by me

1:12:02.840 --> 1:12:06.840
 as intractable, given my particular talents.

1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:08.840
 He then goes on to say,

1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:11.840
 What I have done in science relies entirely

1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:15.840
 on experimental and theoretical studies by experts.

1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:18.840
 I have a great respect for them, especially for those

1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:21.840
 who are willing to attempt communication with someone

1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:24.840
 who is not an expert in the field.

1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:28.840
 I would only add that experts are good at answering questions.

1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:32.840
 If you're brash enough, ask your own.

1:12:32.840 --> 1:12:35.840
 Don't worry too much about how you found them.

1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:47.840
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
