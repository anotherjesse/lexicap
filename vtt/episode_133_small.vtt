00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
 The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis, his third

00:03.680 --> 00:08.640
 time on the podcast. He is a professor at MIT and head of the

00:08.640 --> 00:13.680
 MIT Computational Biology Group. This time, we went deep on the

00:13.680 --> 00:19.320
 science, biology and genetics. So this is a bit of an experiment.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.160
 Manolis went back and forth between the basics of biology

00:23.320 --> 00:27.280
 to the latest state of the art in the research. He's a master

00:27.280 --> 00:31.200
 at this. So I just sat back and enjoyed the ride. This

00:31.200 --> 00:35.520
 conversation happened at 7am. So it's yet another podcast

00:35.520 --> 00:39.760
 episode after an all nighter for me. And once again, since the

00:39.760 --> 00:44.000
 universe has a sense of humor, this one was a tough one for my

00:44.000 --> 00:48.640
 brain to keep up. But I did my best and I never shy away from

00:48.640 --> 00:52.240
 good challenge. Quick mention of a sponsor followed by some

00:52.240 --> 00:57.920
 thoughts related to the episode. First is SEM Rush, the most

00:57.920 --> 01:02.560
 advanced SEO optimization tool I've ever come across. I don't

01:02.560 --> 01:06.320
 like looking at numbers. But someone probably should. It helps

01:06.320 --> 01:10.800
 you make good decisions. Second is pessimist archive. They're

01:10.800 --> 01:14.960
 back. One of my favorite history podcasts on why people resist

01:14.960 --> 01:18.880
 new things from recorded music to umbrellas to cars, chess,

01:18.880 --> 01:24.240
 coffee, and the elevator. Third is 8 Sleep, a mattress that

01:24.240 --> 01:28.240
 cools itself, measures heart rate variability, has an app, and

01:28.240 --> 01:31.280
 has given me yet another reason to look forward to sleep,

01:31.280 --> 01:35.760
 including the all important power nap. And finally, better

01:35.760 --> 01:39.520
 help online therapy when you want to face your demons with a

01:39.520 --> 01:43.520
 licensed professional, not just by doing the David Goggins like

01:43.520 --> 01:47.920
 physical challenges like I seem to do on occasion. Please

01:50.960 --> 01:55.600
 and to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that

01:55.600 --> 01:59.920
 biology in the brain and in the various systems of the body

01:59.920 --> 02:03.280
 fill me with awe. Every time I think about how such a

02:03.280 --> 02:07.200
 chaotic mess coming from its humble origins in the ocean

02:07.200 --> 02:11.120
 was able to achieve such incredibly complex and robust

02:11.120 --> 02:15.440
 mechanisms of life that survived despite all the forces of

02:15.440 --> 02:19.600
 nature that want to destroy it. It is so unlike the computing

02:19.600 --> 02:22.560
 systems we humans have engineered that it makes me feel

02:22.560 --> 02:26.000
 that in order to create artificial general intelligence

02:26.000 --> 02:29.280
 and artificial consciousness, we may have to completely

02:29.280 --> 02:33.600
 rethink how we engineer computational systems. If you

02:44.800 --> 02:50.080
 now here's my conversation with Manolis Callis. So your group

02:50.080 --> 02:53.440
 at MIT is trying to understand the molecular basis of human

02:53.440 --> 02:56.240
 disease. What are some of the biggest challenges in your

02:56.240 --> 03:00.480
 view? Don't get me started. I mean understanding human

03:00.480 --> 03:06.000
 disease is the most complex challenge in modern science.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.520
 So because human disease is as complex as the human genome,

03:11.520 --> 03:17.200
 it is as complex as the human brain. And it is in many ways

03:17.200 --> 03:21.120
 even more complex because the more we understand disease

03:21.120 --> 03:23.600
 complexity, the more we start understanding genome

03:23.600 --> 03:27.440
 complexity and epigenome complexity and brain

03:27.440 --> 03:30.160
 circuitry complexity and immune system complexity and

03:30.160 --> 03:35.120
 cancer complexity and so on and so forth. So traditionally,

03:35.120 --> 03:39.440
 human disease was following basic biology. You would

03:39.440 --> 03:42.640
 basically understand basic biology in model organisms

03:42.640 --> 03:46.080
 like, you know, mouse and fly and yeast. You would

03:46.080 --> 03:49.440
 understand sort of mammalian biology and animal

03:49.440 --> 03:55.360
 biology and eukaryotic biology in sort of progressive layers

03:55.360 --> 03:59.520
 of complexity getting closer to human phylogenetically.

03:59.520 --> 04:04.480
 And you would do perturbation experiments in those species

04:04.480 --> 04:07.680
 to see if I knock out a gene, what happens.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.480
 And based on the knocking out of these genes, you would

04:10.480 --> 04:14.320
 basically then have a way to drive human biology

04:14.320 --> 04:16.400
 because you would you would sort of understand the functions of these

04:16.400 --> 04:19.920
 genes and then if you find that a human gene

04:19.920 --> 04:23.600
 locus, something that you've mapped from human genetics

04:23.600 --> 04:26.960
 to that gene is related to a particular human disease, you

04:26.960 --> 04:31.280
 say, aha, now I know the function of the gene from the model organisms.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.720
 I can now go and understand the function of that gene

04:34.720 --> 04:38.400
 in human. But this is all changing. This is

04:38.400 --> 04:41.680
 dramatically changed. So that that was the old way of doing basic biology. You

04:41.680 --> 04:44.720
 would start with the animal models, the eukaryotic models,

04:44.720 --> 04:48.320
 the mammalian models, and then you would go to human.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.760
 Human genetics has been so transformed in the last

04:51.760 --> 04:55.920
 decade or two that human genetics is now actually

04:55.920 --> 05:01.840
 driving the basic biology. There is more genetic mutation information

05:01.840 --> 05:06.000
 in the human genome than there will ever be in any other species.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.840
 What do you mean by mutation information? So so perturbations is how you

05:09.840 --> 05:13.840
 understand systems. So an engineer builds systems

05:13.840 --> 05:17.280
 and then they know how they work from the inside out. A scientist

05:17.280 --> 05:22.080
 studies systems through perturbations. You basically say if I poke that balloon

05:22.080 --> 05:24.640
 what's going to happen and I'm going to film it in super high resolution

05:24.640 --> 05:28.000
 understand I don't know air dynamics or fluid dynamics if it's filled with water

05:28.000 --> 05:30.800
 etc. So you can then make experimentation by

05:30.800 --> 05:34.000
 perturbation and then the scientific process is sort of

05:34.000 --> 05:39.120
 building models that best fit the data designing you

05:39.120 --> 05:42.400
 experiments that best test your models and challenge your models and so on and so

05:42.400 --> 05:45.360
 forth. That's the same thing with science. Basically if you're trying to

05:45.360 --> 05:49.680
 understand biological science you basically want to do perturbations that

05:49.680 --> 05:55.920
 then drive the models. So how do these perturbations

05:55.920 --> 06:00.400
 allow you to understand disease? So if if you know that

06:00.400 --> 06:04.160
 a gene is related to disease you don't want to just know that it's related to

06:04.160 --> 06:08.160
 the disease. You want to know what is the disease mechanism because you want to

06:08.160 --> 06:12.400
 go and intervene. So the way that I like to describe it is that

06:12.400 --> 06:18.880
 traditionally epidemiology which is basically the study of disease

06:18.880 --> 06:21.760
 you know sort of the observational study of disease

06:21.760 --> 06:25.600
 has been about correlating one thing with another thing.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.560
 So if you if you have a lot of people with liver disease who are also

06:28.560 --> 06:32.000
 alcoholics you might say well maybe the alcoholism is

06:32.000 --> 06:35.040
 driving the liver disease or maybe those who have liver disease

06:35.040 --> 06:39.840
 self medicate with alcohol so that the connection could be either way.

06:39.840 --> 06:45.600
 With genetic epidemiology it's about correlating changes in genome

06:45.600 --> 06:49.920
 with phenotypic differences and then you know the direction of causality.

06:49.920 --> 06:55.120
 So if you know that a particular gene is related to the disease

06:55.120 --> 07:00.080
 you can basically say okay perturbing that gene in mouse

07:00.080 --> 07:06.560
 causes the mice to have x phenotype. So perturbing that gene in human causes

07:06.560 --> 07:09.840
 the humans to have the disease so I can now figure out what are the

07:09.840 --> 07:15.280
 detailed molecular phenotypes in the human that are related to

07:15.280 --> 07:19.120
 that organismal phenotype in the disease. So it's all

07:19.120 --> 07:22.720
 about understanding disease mechanism, understanding what are the pathways,

07:22.720 --> 07:25.920
 what are the tissues, what are the processes

07:25.920 --> 07:28.800
 that are associated with the disease so that we know how to intervene.

07:28.800 --> 07:33.120
 You can then prescribe particular medications that also alter these processes.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.040
 You can prescribe lifestyle changes that also affect these processes

07:37.040 --> 07:40.800
 and so on so forth. That's such a beautiful puzzle to try to solve

07:40.800 --> 07:44.000
 like what kind of perturbations eventually have this ripple effect that

07:44.000 --> 07:47.200
 leads to disease across the population and then you

07:47.200 --> 07:51.840
 study that for animals, a mice first and then see how that might possibly

07:51.840 --> 07:56.800
 connect to humans. How hard is that puzzle of

07:56.800 --> 08:01.120
 trying to figure out how little perturbations might lead to

08:01.120 --> 08:07.200
 in a stable way to a disease? In animals we make the puzzle

08:07.200 --> 08:10.720
 simpler because we perturb one gene at a time.

08:10.720 --> 08:14.080
 That's the beauty and that's the power of animal models. You can basically

08:14.080 --> 08:16.800
 decouple the perturbations. You only do one

08:16.800 --> 08:22.160
 perturbation and you only do strong perturbations at a time. In human the

08:22.160 --> 08:27.040
 puzzle is incredibly complex because obviously you don't do

08:27.040 --> 08:30.640
 human experimentation. You wait for natural selection

08:30.640 --> 08:35.040
 and natural genetic variation to basically do its own experiments which it

08:35.040 --> 08:38.800
 has been doing for hundreds and thousands of years

08:38.800 --> 08:43.120
 in the human population and for hundreds of thousands of years

08:43.120 --> 08:49.120
 across the history leading to the human population.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.560
 You basically take this natural genetic variation

08:52.560 --> 08:55.840
 that we all carry within us. Every one of us carries

08:55.840 --> 09:00.320
 six million perturbations. I've done six million experiments on you,

09:00.320 --> 09:03.840
 six million experiments on me, six million experiments on every one

09:03.840 --> 09:08.640
 of seven billion people on the planet. What's the six million correspond to?

09:08.640 --> 09:13.520
 Six million unique genetic variants that are segregating in the human

09:13.520 --> 09:18.160
 population. Every one of us carries millions of

09:18.160 --> 09:24.080
 polymorphic sites, poly, many morph forms. Polymorphic means many forms

09:24.080 --> 09:27.440
 variants. That basically means that every one of us has

09:27.440 --> 09:31.600
 single nucleotide alterations that we have inherited from mom and from dad

09:31.600 --> 09:36.000
 that basically can be thought of as tiny little perturbations.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.840
 Most of them don't do anything but some of them

09:39.840 --> 09:43.680
 lead to all of the phenotypic differences that we see between us.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.840
 The reason why two twins are identical is because these variants

09:47.840 --> 09:52.320
 completely determine the way that I'm going to look at exactly 93 years of age.

09:52.320 --> 09:57.200
 How happy are you with this kind of data set? Is it large enough

09:57.200 --> 10:01.520
 of the human population of Earth? Is that too big, too small?

10:01.520 --> 10:06.800
 Yeah, so is it large enough is a power analysis question?

10:06.800 --> 10:11.040
 In every one of our grants, we do a power analysis based on what is the effect

10:11.040 --> 10:17.120
 size that I would like to detect and what is the natural variation

10:17.120 --> 10:20.880
 in the two forms. Every time you do a perturbation, you're asking I'm changing

10:20.880 --> 10:25.520
 form A into form B. Form A has some natural

10:25.520 --> 10:30.080
 phenotypic variation around it and form B has some natural phenotypic variation

10:30.080 --> 10:33.280
 around it. If those variances are large and the

10:33.280 --> 10:36.960
 differences between the mean of A and the mean of B are small,

10:36.960 --> 10:40.960
 then you have very little power. The further the means go apart,

10:40.960 --> 10:44.320
 that's the effect size, the more power you have,

10:44.320 --> 10:48.480
 and the smaller the standard deviation, the more power you have.

10:48.480 --> 10:52.480
 So basically when you're asking is that sufficiently large?

10:52.480 --> 10:56.000
 Certainly not for everything but we already have enough power

10:56.000 --> 11:01.440
 for many of the stronger effects in the more tight distributions.

11:01.440 --> 11:05.440
 So that's a hopeful message that there exists

11:05.440 --> 11:11.760
 parts of the genome that have a strong effect that has a small

11:11.760 --> 11:14.960
 variance? That's exactly right. Unfortunately,

11:14.960 --> 11:18.480
 those perturbations are the basis of disease in many cases.

11:18.480 --> 11:22.480
 So it's not a hopeful message, sometimes it's a terrible message.

11:22.480 --> 11:26.640
 It's basically well some people are sick but if we can figure out

11:26.640 --> 11:30.720
 what are these contributors to sickness, we can then help make them better and

11:30.720 --> 11:34.720
 help many other people better who don't carry that exact mutation

11:34.720 --> 11:38.720
 but who carry mutations on the same pathways

11:38.720 --> 11:41.600
 and that's what we like to call the allelic series

11:41.600 --> 11:46.160
 of a gene. You basically have many perturbations

11:46.160 --> 11:50.400
 of the same gene in different people each with a different

11:50.400 --> 11:54.400
 frequency in the human population and each with a different effect

11:54.400 --> 11:58.480
 on the individual that carries them. So you said in the past

11:58.480 --> 12:03.760
 there would be these small experiments on perturbations and animal models.

12:03.760 --> 12:08.240
 What does this puzzle solving process look like today?

12:08.240 --> 12:11.760
 So we basically have you know something like seven billion people in the

12:11.760 --> 12:15.120
 planet and every one of them carries something like six million

12:15.120 --> 12:18.560
 mutations. You basically have an enormous

12:18.560 --> 12:24.880
 matrix of genotype by phenotype by systematically measuring

12:24.880 --> 12:29.440
 the phenotype of these individuals and the traditional way of measuring this

12:29.440 --> 12:33.520
 phenotype has been to look at one trait at a time.

12:33.520 --> 12:37.120
 You would gather families and you would sort of paint

12:37.120 --> 12:40.880
 the pedigrees of a strong effect what we like to call

12:40.880 --> 12:46.000
 Mendelian mutation. So a mutation that gets transmitted

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
 in a dominant or a recessive but strong effect form

12:50.000 --> 12:53.280
 where basically one locus plays a very big role

12:53.280 --> 12:56.800
 in that disease and you could then look at carriers versus non carriers

12:56.800 --> 13:00.960
 in one family, carries versus non carries in another family

13:00.960 --> 13:04.320
 and do that for hundreds sometimes thousands of families

13:04.320 --> 13:08.160
 and then trace these inheritance patterns and then figure out what is the gene

13:08.160 --> 13:11.280
 that plays that role. Is this the matrix that you're showing

13:11.280 --> 13:18.800
 in talks or lectures? So that matrix is the input

13:18.800 --> 13:22.800
 to the stuff that I show in talks. So basically that matrix has traditionally

13:22.800 --> 13:26.640
 been strong effect genes. What the matrix looks like now

13:26.640 --> 13:30.960
 is instead of pedigrees instead of families you basically have

13:30.960 --> 13:35.920
 thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of unrelated individuals

13:35.920 --> 13:39.680
 each with all of their genetic variants and each with their phenotype

13:39.680 --> 13:44.320
 for example height or lipids or you know whether they're

13:44.320 --> 13:49.600
 sick or not for a particular trait. That has been the modern view

13:49.600 --> 13:53.120
 instead of going to families going to unrelated individuals

13:53.120 --> 13:56.800
 with one phenotype at a time and what we're doing now

13:56.800 --> 14:00.240
 as we're maturing in all of these sciences

14:00.240 --> 14:04.560
 is that we're doing this in the context of large medical systems

14:04.560 --> 14:08.640
 or enormous cohorts that are very well phenotyped across

14:08.640 --> 14:13.520
 hundreds of phenotypes sometimes with their complete electronic health record.

14:13.520 --> 14:18.080
 So you can now start relating not just one gene segregating one family

14:18.080 --> 14:22.640
 not just thousands of variants segregating with one phenotype

14:22.640 --> 14:26.880
 but now you can do millions of variants versus hundreds of phenotypes

14:26.880 --> 14:31.680
 and as a computer scientist I mean deconvolving that matrix partitioning it

14:31.680 --> 14:37.200
 into the layers of biology that are associated with every one of these

14:37.200 --> 14:42.560
 elements is a dream come true it's it's like the world's greatest puzzle

14:42.560 --> 14:46.640
 and you can now solve that puzzle by throwing in

14:46.640 --> 14:52.560
 more and more knowledge about the function of different genomic regions

14:52.560 --> 14:56.080
 and how these functions are changed across tissues

14:56.080 --> 14:59.840
 and in the context of disease and that's what my group and many other groups

14:59.840 --> 15:03.600
 are doing we're trying to systematically relate this genetic variation

15:03.600 --> 15:08.160
 with molecular variation at the expression level of the genes

15:08.160 --> 15:12.480
 at the epigenomic level of the gene regulatory circuitry

15:12.480 --> 15:15.920
 and at the cellular level of what are the functions that are happening in those

15:15.920 --> 15:19.360
 cells at the single cell level using single cell

15:19.360 --> 15:23.520
 profiling and then relate all that vast amount of knowledge

15:23.520 --> 15:27.360
 computationally with the thousands of traits

15:27.360 --> 15:31.200
 that each of these of thousands of variants are perturbing.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.720
 I mean this is something we talked about I think last time so there's these

15:34.720 --> 15:38.560
 effects at different levels that happen you said at a single cell level

15:38.560 --> 15:42.560
 you're trying to see things that happen due to certain perturbations

15:42.560 --> 15:46.960
 and then so it's not just like a puzzle of

15:46.960 --> 15:51.840
 perturbation and disease it's perturbation then

15:51.840 --> 15:55.040
 effect at the cellular level then at an organ level

15:55.040 --> 16:02.240
 that by like how do you disassemble this into like what your group is working on

16:02.240 --> 16:06.320
 you're basically taking a bunch of the hard problems in the space

16:06.320 --> 16:10.880
 how do you break apart a difficult disease

16:10.880 --> 16:14.800
 and break it apart into problems that you into puzzles that you can now start

16:14.800 --> 16:17.360
 solving. So there's a struggle here computer

16:17.360 --> 16:20.880
 scientists love hard puzzles and they're like oh I want to

16:20.880 --> 16:24.560
 you know build a method that just deconvolves the whole thing computationally

16:24.560 --> 16:28.400
 and you know that's very tempting and it's very appealing

16:28.400 --> 16:32.880
 but biologists just like to decouple that complexity experimentally

16:32.880 --> 16:35.840
 to just like peel off layers of complexity experimentally

16:35.840 --> 16:39.280
 and that's what many of these modern tools that you know my group and others

16:39.280 --> 16:43.120
 have both developed and used the fact that we can now

16:43.120 --> 16:46.720
 figure out tricks for peeling off these layers of complexity

16:46.720 --> 16:52.720
 by testing one cell type at a time or by testing one cell at a time

16:52.720 --> 16:56.240
 and you could basically say what is the effect of this genetic variant associated

16:56.240 --> 17:00.560
 with Alzheimer's on human brain. Human brain

17:00.560 --> 17:04.080
 sounds like oh it's an organ of course just go one organ at a time

17:04.080 --> 17:08.320
 but human brain has of course dozens of different brain regions

17:08.320 --> 17:12.400
 and within each of these brain regions dozens of different cell types

17:12.400 --> 17:16.720
 and every single type of neuron every single type of glial cell

17:16.720 --> 17:20.480
 between astrocytes oligodendrocytes microglia

17:20.480 --> 17:26.320
 between you know all of the mural cells and the vascular cells and the immune

17:26.320 --> 17:29.840
 cells that are coinhabiting the the brain between the

17:29.840 --> 17:32.960
 different types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons

17:32.960 --> 17:36.160
 that are sort of interacting with each other between different layers

17:36.160 --> 17:40.720
 of neurons in the cortical layers every single one of these

17:40.720 --> 17:46.960
 has a different type of function to play in cognition

17:46.960 --> 17:50.640
 in interaction with the environment in maintenance

17:50.640 --> 17:58.160
 of the brain in energetic needs in feeding the brain with blood with oxygen

17:58.160 --> 18:02.720
 in clearing out the debris that are resulting from the super high energy

18:02.720 --> 18:12.080
 production of cognition in humans so all of these things are basically

18:12.080 --> 18:16.800
 potentially deconvolvable computationally but experimentally

18:16.800 --> 18:21.200
 you can just do single cell profiling of dozens of regions of the brain across

18:21.200 --> 18:24.320
 hundreds of individuals across millions of cells

18:24.320 --> 18:27.920
 and then now you have pieces of the puzzle

18:27.920 --> 18:31.360
 that you can then put back together to understand

18:31.360 --> 18:35.520
 that complexity i mean first of all i mean the human brain the cells in the

18:35.520 --> 18:40.080
 human brain are the most okay maybe i'm romanticizing it but cognition

18:40.080 --> 18:44.800
 seems to be very complicated so separating into

18:44.800 --> 18:52.480
 the function breaking Alzheimer's down to the cellular

18:52.480 --> 18:58.960
 level seems very challenging is that basically you're trying to find

18:58.960 --> 19:06.240
 a way that some perturbation in genome results in

19:06.240 --> 19:13.120
 some obvious major dysfunction in the cell you're trying to find something

19:13.120 --> 19:16.160
 like that exactly so so what does human

19:16.160 --> 19:19.600
 genetics do human genetics basically looks at the whole path

19:19.600 --> 19:22.960
 from genetic variation all the way to disease

19:22.960 --> 19:27.600
 so human genetics has basically taken thousands of

19:27.600 --> 19:31.680
 Alzheimer's cases and thousands of controls

19:31.680 --> 19:36.400
 matched for age for sex for you know environmental

19:36.400 --> 19:40.160
 backgrounds and so on so forth and then looked at that map

19:40.160 --> 19:44.480
 where you're asking what are the individual genetic perturbations

19:44.480 --> 19:48.320
 and how are they related to all the way to Alzheimer's disease

19:48.320 --> 19:52.160
 and that has actually been quite successful so we now have

19:52.160 --> 19:56.720
 you know more than 27 different loci these are genomic regions

19:56.720 --> 20:02.800
 that are associated with Alzheimer's at this end to end level but the moment

20:02.800 --> 20:06.720
 you sort of break up that very long path into smaller levels

20:06.720 --> 20:10.160
 you can basically say from genetics what are the

20:10.160 --> 20:14.080
 epigenomic alterations at the level of gene regulatory elements

20:14.080 --> 20:18.960
 where that genetic variant perturbs the control region nearby

20:18.960 --> 20:23.520
 that effect is much larger you mean much larger in terms of his

20:23.520 --> 20:26.880
 down the line impact or it's much larger in terms of the

20:26.880 --> 20:31.920
 measurable effect this a versus b variants is actually so much

20:31.920 --> 20:35.520
 cleanly defined when you go to the shorter branches

20:35.520 --> 20:39.200
 because for one genetic variant to affect Alzheimer's

20:39.200 --> 20:42.880
 that's a very long path that basically means that in the context of millions of

20:42.880 --> 20:45.440
 these six million variants that every one of us carries

20:45.440 --> 20:50.160
 that one single nucleotide has a detectable effect

20:50.160 --> 20:52.960
 all the way to the end I mean it's just mind boggling that that's even

20:52.960 --> 20:56.880
 possible but indeed yeah but indeed there are such

20:56.880 --> 21:00.560
 effects so the hope is or the most scientifically

21:00.560 --> 21:04.880
 speaking the the most effective place where to detect

21:04.880 --> 21:09.440
 the alteration that results in disease is earlier on in the pipeline

21:09.440 --> 21:12.480
 as early as possible it's it's it's a trade off

21:12.480 --> 21:15.840
 if you go very early on in the pipeline now each of these

21:15.840 --> 21:20.400
 epigenomic alterations for example this enhancer control region

21:20.400 --> 21:25.360
 is active maybe 50 less which is a dramatic effect

21:25.360 --> 21:28.480
 now you can ask well how much just changing one regulatory region in the

21:28.480 --> 21:32.240
 genome in one cell type change disease well that path is now

21:32.240 --> 21:37.520
 long so if you instead look at expression

21:37.520 --> 21:40.800
 the path between genetic variation and the expression of one gene goes through

21:40.800 --> 21:44.560
 many enhancer regions and therefore it's a subtler effect at the gene

21:44.560 --> 21:47.840
 level but then now you're closer because

21:47.840 --> 21:52.160
 one gene is acting on you know in the context of only 20 000 other genes

21:52.160 --> 21:57.040
 as opposed to one enhancer acting in the context of two million other enhancers

21:57.040 --> 22:02.000
 so you basically now have genetic epigenomic the circuitry

22:02.000 --> 22:06.800
 transcriptomic the gene expression level and then cellular where you can

22:06.800 --> 22:10.880
 basically say I can measure various properties of those cells

22:10.880 --> 22:17.280
 what is the calcium influx rate when I have these genetic variation

22:17.280 --> 22:21.200
 what is the synaptic density what is the electric

22:21.200 --> 22:25.840
 impulse conductivity and so on so forth so you can measure

22:25.840 --> 22:31.360
 things along this path to disease and you can also measure

22:31.360 --> 22:35.840
 endophenotypes you can basically measure you know

22:35.840 --> 22:39.440
 your brain activity you can do imaging in the brain

22:39.440 --> 22:43.120
 you can basically measure I don't know the heart rate the pulse the lipids

22:43.120 --> 22:48.640
 the amount of blood secreted and so on so forth and then through all of that

22:48.640 --> 22:55.040
 you can basically get at the path to causality the path to disease

22:55.040 --> 23:00.160
 and is there something beyond cellular so you mentioned lifestyle

23:00.160 --> 23:06.080
 interventions or changes as a way to uh or like be able to prescribe changes in

23:06.080 --> 23:11.120
 lifestyle like what about organs what about like

23:11.120 --> 23:14.720
 the function of the body as a whole yeah absolutely so basically

23:14.720 --> 23:18.480
 when you go to your doctor they always measure you know your pulse they always

23:18.480 --> 23:20.400
 measure your height those measure your weight

23:20.400 --> 23:23.920
 your you know your bmi so basically these are just very basic variables

23:23.920 --> 23:27.840
 but with digital devices nowadays you can start measuring hundreds of variables

23:27.840 --> 23:32.000
 for every individual you can basically also phenotype

23:32.000 --> 23:37.040
 cognitively through tests uh Alzheimer's patients

23:37.040 --> 23:40.880
 there are cognitive tests that you can measure that you that you typically do

23:40.880 --> 23:46.800
 for cognitive decline these mini mental you know observations that that you have

23:46.800 --> 23:49.920
 specific questions too you can think of sort of enlarging the

23:49.920 --> 23:53.920
 set of cognitive tests so in the mouse for example you do experiments for how

23:53.920 --> 23:59.040
 do they get out of mazes how do they find food whether they recall a fear

23:59.040 --> 24:02.880
 whether they shake in a new environment and so on so forth in the human you can

24:02.880 --> 24:06.320
 have much much richer phenotypes where you can basically say

24:06.320 --> 24:11.120
 not just imaging at the you know organ level but

24:11.120 --> 24:14.640
 and in all kinds of other activities at the organ level but you can also do at

24:14.640 --> 24:19.200
 the organism level you can do behavioral tests

24:19.200 --> 24:22.720
 and how did they do on empathy how did they do on memory

24:22.720 --> 24:25.920
 how did they do on long term memory versus short term memory

24:25.920 --> 24:28.640
 and so on so forth i love how you're calling that phenotype

24:28.640 --> 24:33.520
 i guess it is it is but like your behavior patterns that might change over

24:33.520 --> 24:38.320
 over a period of a life yet your ability to remember

24:38.320 --> 24:42.560
 things your ability to be yeah empathetic or emotionally

24:42.560 --> 24:46.880
 your intelligence perhaps even yeah but intelligence has hundreds of variables

24:46.880 --> 24:50.160
 you can be your math intelligence your literary intelligence your puzzle solving

24:50.160 --> 24:53.840
 intelligence your logic it could be like hundreds of things and all that

24:53.840 --> 24:56.960
 it's we were able to measure that better and better so all that could be

24:56.960 --> 25:00.320
 connected to the entire pipeline so we used to think of each of these as a

25:00.320 --> 25:03.120
 single variable like intelligence i mean that's ridiculous

25:03.120 --> 25:08.640
 it's basically dozens of different genes that are controlling

25:08.640 --> 25:11.840
 every single variable you can basically think of

25:11.840 --> 25:15.600
 you know imagine us in a video game where every one of us has

25:15.600 --> 25:20.720
 measures of you know strength stamina you know energy left and so on so forth

25:20.720 --> 25:24.000
 but you could click on each of those like five bars that are just the main bars

25:24.000 --> 25:26.640
 and each of those will just give you then hundreds of bars

25:26.640 --> 25:31.120
 yeah and you basically say okay great for my you know machine learning task

25:31.120 --> 25:35.200
 i want someone who i'm a human who has

25:35.200 --> 25:38.560
 these particular forms of intelligence i require now these

25:38.560 --> 25:42.160
 you know 20 different things and then you can combine those things

25:42.160 --> 25:46.000
 and then relate them to of course performance in particular task

25:46.000 --> 25:49.280
 but you can also relate them to genetic variation

25:49.280 --> 25:52.560
 that might be affecting different parts of the brain

25:52.560 --> 25:56.160
 for example your frontal cortex versus your temporal cortex versus your visual

25:56.160 --> 25:59.920
 cortex and so on so forth so genetic variation that affects

25:59.920 --> 26:02.400
 expression of genes in different parts of your brain

26:02.400 --> 26:06.560
 can basically affect your you know music ability your auditory ability your

26:06.560 --> 26:09.920
 smell your you know just dozens of different

26:09.920 --> 26:15.680
 phenotypes can be broken down into you know hundreds of cognitive variables

26:15.680 --> 26:19.760
 and then relate each of those to thousands of genes that are associated

26:19.760 --> 26:23.440
 with them so somebody who loves RPGs role playing

26:23.440 --> 26:27.600
 games there's uh there's too few variables that

26:27.600 --> 26:31.040
 we can control so i'm excited if we're in fact living in a simulation

26:31.040 --> 26:35.520
 this is a video game i'm excited by the quality of the video game

26:35.520 --> 26:39.040
 the the the game designer did a hell of a

26:39.040 --> 26:42.160
 good job so we're impressed so i don't know at the sunset last

26:42.160 --> 26:46.960
 night was a little unrealistic yeah yeah the graphics

26:46.960 --> 26:52.320
 exactly come on in video to zoom back out we've been talking about the

26:52.320 --> 26:56.000
 genetic origins of diseases but i think it's fascinating to

26:56.000 --> 27:00.640
 talk about what are the most important diseases to understand

27:00.640 --> 27:05.120
 and especially as it connects to the things that you're working on

27:05.120 --> 27:08.800
 so it's very difficult to think about important diseases to understand there's

27:08.800 --> 27:12.880
 many metrics of importance one is lifestyle impact

27:12.880 --> 27:16.240
 i mean if you look at covid the impact on lifestyle has been enormous

27:16.240 --> 27:20.560
 so understanding covid is important because it has impacted

27:20.560 --> 27:24.400
 the well being in terms of ability to have a job

27:24.400 --> 27:28.400
 ability to have an apartment ability to go to work ability to have a mental

27:28.400 --> 27:32.880
 circle of support and uh all of that for you know millions of

27:32.880 --> 27:36.480
 americans like huge huge impact so that's one aspect of

27:36.480 --> 27:40.080
 importance so basically mental disorders alzheimer's has a huge

27:40.080 --> 27:43.680
 importance in the well being of americans

27:43.680 --> 27:48.000
 whether or not it die it kills someone for many many years it has a huge impact

27:48.000 --> 27:51.760
 so the first measure of importance is just well being

27:51.760 --> 27:55.680
 like impact on the quality of life impact on the quality of life absolutely

27:55.680 --> 27:59.920
 the second metric which is much easier to quantify is deaths

27:59.920 --> 28:03.040
 what is the number one killer the number one killer

28:03.040 --> 28:08.480
 is actually heart disease it is actually killing 650 thousand americans per

28:08.480 --> 28:12.480
 year number two is cancer with 600

28:12.480 --> 28:15.600
 thousand americans number three far far down the

28:15.600 --> 28:19.600
 list is accidents every single accident combined so

28:19.600 --> 28:23.040
 basically you you know you read the news accidents like you know there was a

28:23.040 --> 28:27.600
 huge car crash all over the news but the number of deaths

28:27.600 --> 28:33.520
 number three by far 167 thousand lower respiratory disease so that's asthma

28:33.520 --> 28:37.760
 not being able to breathe and so on so forth 160 000

28:37.760 --> 28:42.160
 alzheimer's number four number five with 120 000

28:42.160 --> 28:46.640
 and then stroke brain aneurysms and so on so forth that's 147 000

28:46.640 --> 28:50.960
 diabetes and metabolic disorders etc that's 85 000

28:50.960 --> 28:58.080
 the flu is 60 000 suicide 50 000 and then overdose etc

28:58.080 --> 29:02.080
 you know goes further down the list so of course covid has creeped up to be the

29:02.080 --> 29:06.400
 number three killer this year with you know

29:06.400 --> 29:13.920
 more than 100 000 americans and counting um and you know but but if you think

29:13.920 --> 29:17.200
 about sort of what do we use what are the most important diseases you have to

29:17.200 --> 29:22.160
 understand both the quality of life and the just sheer number of

29:22.160 --> 29:26.480
 deaths and just numbers of years lost if you wish and and uh each of these

29:26.480 --> 29:30.000
 diseases you can think of as uh and also including terrorist

29:30.000 --> 29:33.760
 attacks and school shootings for example

29:33.760 --> 29:37.520
 things which lead to fatalities you can look at

29:37.520 --> 29:43.600
 as problems that could be solved and some problems are harder to solve than

29:43.600 --> 29:47.440
 others i mean that's part of the equation so maybe if you

29:47.440 --> 29:50.960
 look at these diseases if you look at heart disease or cancer

29:50.960 --> 29:56.080
 or alzheimer's or just uh like schizophrenia and

29:56.080 --> 29:59.840
 obesity debut like not necessarily things that kill you but

29:59.840 --> 30:04.080
 affect the quality of life which problems are solvable

30:04.080 --> 30:07.120
 which aren't which are harder to solve which aren't

30:07.120 --> 30:11.520
 i love your question because you put it in the context of a global

30:11.520 --> 30:15.840
 um effort rather than just a local effort so basically

30:15.840 --> 30:21.840
 if you look at the global aspect exercise and nutrition are two

30:21.840 --> 30:26.800
 interventions that we can as a society make a much better job at

30:26.800 --> 30:30.560
 so if you think about sort of the availability of cheap food

30:30.560 --> 30:34.960
 it's extremely high in calories it's extremely detrimental for you like a

30:34.960 --> 30:39.520
 lot of processed food etc so if we change that equation

30:39.520 --> 30:42.720
 and as a society we made availability of healthy food

30:42.720 --> 30:50.080
 much much easier and charged a burger at mcdonald's the price that it costs

30:50.080 --> 30:54.480
 on the health system then people would actually start buying more

30:54.480 --> 30:57.200
 healthy uh foods so basically that's sort of a

30:57.200 --> 31:01.760
 societal intervention if you wish in the same way

31:01.760 --> 31:05.680
 increasing empathy increasing education increasing the social

31:05.680 --> 31:09.840
 framework and support would basically lead to fewer suicides

31:09.840 --> 31:12.960
 it would lead to fewer murders it would lead to fewer

31:12.960 --> 31:17.680
 you know deaths overall um so you know that's something that we as a society

31:17.680 --> 31:21.040
 can do you can you can also think about external factors versus

31:21.040 --> 31:23.760
 internal factors so the external factors are basically communicable

31:23.760 --> 31:29.040
 diseases like covid like the flu etc and the internal

31:29.040 --> 31:32.800
 factors are basically things like you know cancer and Alzheimer's where

31:32.800 --> 31:36.880
 basically your your genetics will eventually you know drive you there

31:36.880 --> 31:41.040
 um and then of course with all of these

31:41.040 --> 31:44.320
 factors every single disease has both a genetic component

31:44.320 --> 31:48.080
 and environmental component so heart disease you know huge genetic

31:48.080 --> 31:52.000
 contributor contribution alzheimer's it's like you know

31:52.000 --> 31:57.680
 60 plus genetic so i think it's like 79 percent

31:57.680 --> 32:01.520
 heritability so that basically means that genetics alone

32:01.520 --> 32:08.160
 explains 79 percent of alzheimer's incidents and yes there's a 21

32:08.160 --> 32:11.760
 percent environmental component where you could basically

32:11.760 --> 32:18.160
 enrich your cognitive environment enrich your social interactions

32:18.160 --> 32:22.080
 read more books learn a foreign language go running

32:22.080 --> 32:25.760
 you know sort of have a more fulfilling life all of that will actually decrease

32:25.760 --> 32:28.800
 alzheimer's but there's a limit to how much that that can

32:28.800 --> 32:32.640
 impact because of the huge genetic footprint so this is fascinating so

32:32.640 --> 32:36.720
 each one of these problems have a genetic component

32:36.720 --> 32:41.200
 and an environment component and so like when there's a genetic component

32:41.200 --> 32:44.640
 what can we do about some of these diseases what what have you worked on

32:44.640 --> 32:48.480
 what can you say that's uh in terms of problems that are solvable here

32:48.480 --> 32:52.720
 or understandable so my group works on the genetic component

32:52.720 --> 32:55.920
 but i would argue that understanding the genetic component

32:55.920 --> 32:59.520
 can have a huge impact even on the environmental component

32:59.520 --> 33:03.360
 why is that because genetics gives us access to mechanism

33:03.360 --> 33:07.600
 and if we can alter the mechanism if we can impact the mechanism

33:07.600 --> 33:10.960
 we can perhaps counteract some of the environmental components all

33:10.960 --> 33:16.080
 interesting so understanding the biological mechanisms leading to

33:16.080 --> 33:19.520
 disease is extremely important in being able to

33:19.520 --> 33:24.320
 intervene but when you can intervene what you know the analogy that i like to

33:24.320 --> 33:27.360
 give is for example for obesity you know think

33:27.360 --> 33:32.880
 of it as a giant bathtub of fat there's basically fat coming in from your diet

33:32.880 --> 33:36.880
 and there's fat coming out from your exercise

33:36.880 --> 33:41.200
 okay that's an in out equation and that's the equation that everybody's

33:41.200 --> 33:47.280
 focusing on but your metabolism impacts that you know bathtub

33:47.280 --> 33:51.600
 basically your metabolism controls the rate at which

33:51.600 --> 33:54.960
 you're burning energy it controls the way the rate at which you're storing

33:54.960 --> 34:00.480
 energy and it also teaches you about the various

34:00.480 --> 34:03.760
 valves that control the input and the output equation

34:03.760 --> 34:07.920
 so if we can learn from the genetics the valves

34:07.920 --> 34:12.960
 we can then manipulate those valves and even if the environment is feeding you

34:12.960 --> 34:15.760
 a lot of fat and getting a little that out

34:15.760 --> 34:19.360
 you can just poke another hole at the bathtub and just get a lot of the fat

34:19.360 --> 34:23.040
 out yeah that's fascinating yeah so that we're not just

34:23.040 --> 34:27.680
 passive observers of our genetics the more we understand the more we can come

34:27.680 --> 34:31.200
 up with actual treatments and i think that's an important

34:31.200 --> 34:35.200
 aspect to realize when people are thinking about

34:35.200 --> 34:39.040
 strong effect versus weak effect variants so some variants have strong

34:39.040 --> 34:41.920
 effects we talked about these Mendelian disorders where a single

34:41.920 --> 34:45.520
 gene has a sufficiently large effect pen and trans expressivity and so on so

34:45.520 --> 34:51.040
 forth that basically you can trace it in families with

34:51.040 --> 34:54.960
 cases and not cases cases not cases and so forth

34:54.960 --> 35:01.360
 but even the you know but so these are the genes that everybody says oh

35:01.360 --> 35:04.800
 that's the genes we should go after because that's a strong effect gene

35:04.800 --> 35:07.920
 i like to think about it slightly differently these are the genes

35:07.920 --> 35:12.560
 where genetic impacts that have a strong effect

35:12.560 --> 35:16.880
 were tolerated because every single time we have a genetic

35:16.880 --> 35:19.920
 association with disease it depends on two things

35:19.920 --> 35:24.400
 number one the obvious one whether the gene has an impact on the disease

35:24.400 --> 35:27.760
 number two the more subtle one is whether there is

35:27.760 --> 35:32.320
 genetic variation standing and circulating and

35:32.320 --> 35:37.440
 segregating in the human population that impacts that gene

35:37.440 --> 35:42.080
 some genes are so darn important that if you mess with them

35:42.080 --> 35:46.240
 even a tiny little amount that person is dead

35:46.240 --> 35:50.320
 so those genes don't have variation you're not going to find a genetic

35:50.320 --> 35:54.240
 association if you don't have variation that doesn't mean that the gene has no

35:54.240 --> 35:56.800
 role it simply that the gene it simply means

35:56.800 --> 36:00.480
 that the gene tolerates no mutations so that's actually a strong signal when

36:00.480 --> 36:03.200
 there's no variation that's so fast exactly

36:03.200 --> 36:07.280
 genes that have very little variation are hugely important you can actually

36:07.280 --> 36:10.640
 rank the importance of genes based on how little variation they have

36:10.640 --> 36:15.360
 and those genes that have very little variation but no association

36:15.360 --> 36:19.200
 with disease that's a very good metric to say oh that's probably a developmental

36:19.200 --> 36:22.640
 gene because we're not good at measuring those phenotypes

36:22.640 --> 36:26.160
 so it's genes that you can tell evolution has excluded

36:26.160 --> 36:30.560
 mutations from but yet we can't see them associated with anything that we can

36:30.560 --> 36:34.640
 measure nowadays it's probably early embryonic lethal

36:34.640 --> 36:38.240
 what are all the words you just said early embryonic what lethal

36:38.240 --> 36:44.880
 meaning meaning that if you don't have that okay there's a bunch of stuff that

36:44.880 --> 36:48.480
 is required for a stable functional organism

36:48.480 --> 36:54.160
 across the board exactly our entire for for entire species I guess if you look

36:54.160 --> 36:58.480
 at sperm it expresses thousands of proteins

36:58.480 --> 37:01.680
 does sperm actually need thousands of proteins no

37:01.680 --> 37:06.400
 but it's probably just testing them so my speculation

37:06.400 --> 37:10.240
 is that misfolding of these proteins is an early

37:10.240 --> 37:14.800
 test for failure so that out of the you know millions of sperm

37:14.800 --> 37:20.400
 that are possible you select the subset that are just not grossly misfolding

37:20.400 --> 37:23.680
 thousands of proteins so it's kind of an insert

37:23.680 --> 37:27.440
 that this is folded correctly correct yeah this just

37:27.440 --> 37:32.240
 because if this little thing about the folding of a protein isn't correct

37:32.240 --> 37:35.440
 that probably means somewhere down the line there's a bigger issue

37:35.440 --> 37:39.840
 that's exactly right so fail fast so basically if you look at the mammalian

37:39.840 --> 37:45.120
 investment in a newborn that investment is

37:45.120 --> 37:49.920
 enormous in terms of resources so mammals have basically evolved

37:49.920 --> 37:53.840
 mechanisms for fail fast we're basically in those

37:53.840 --> 37:58.400
 early months of development I mean it's it's horrendous of course at the

37:58.400 --> 38:03.280
 personal level when you lose a you know your future child

38:03.280 --> 38:10.080
 but in some ways there's so little hope for that child to develop

38:10.080 --> 38:12.960
 and sort of make it through the remaining months that sort of fail fast is

38:12.960 --> 38:17.440
 probably a good evolutionary principle from an evolutionary

38:17.440 --> 38:23.600
 for mammals and of course humans have a lot of medical resources

38:23.600 --> 38:26.640
 that you can sort of give those children a chance

38:26.640 --> 38:32.160
 and you know we have so much more success instead of giving

38:32.160 --> 38:35.920
 folks who have these strong carrier mutations a chance but if they're not

38:35.920 --> 38:39.600
 even making it through the first three months we're not going to see them

38:39.600 --> 38:44.480
 so that's why when we when we say what are the most important genes to focus on

38:44.480 --> 38:47.680
 the ones that have a strong effect mutation or the ones that have a weak

38:47.680 --> 38:51.120
 effect mutation well you know the jury might be out

38:51.120 --> 38:53.840
 because the ones that have a strong effect mutation

38:53.840 --> 38:58.480
 are basically you know not mattering that much

38:58.480 --> 39:03.360
 the ones that only have weak effect mutations by understanding

39:03.360 --> 39:06.960
 through genetics that they have a weak effect mutation

39:06.960 --> 39:10.000
 and understanding that they have a causal role on the disease

39:10.000 --> 39:13.520
 we can then say okay great evolution has only tolerated a two percent

39:13.520 --> 39:19.120
 change in that gene pharmaceutically I can go in and induce a 70 percent

39:19.120 --> 39:22.800
 change in that gene and maybe I will poke another

39:22.800 --> 39:30.960
 hole at the bathtub that was not easy to control

39:30.960 --> 39:34.880
 in you know many of the other sort of strong effect genetic variants

39:34.880 --> 39:40.960
 so okay so there's this beautiful map of across the population of things that

39:40.960 --> 39:45.120
 you're saying strong and weak effects so stuff with a lot of mutations and stuff

39:45.120 --> 39:48.640
 with little mutations with no mutations any of this

39:48.640 --> 39:53.760
 map and it lays out the puzzle yeah so so when I say strong effect I mean at

39:53.760 --> 39:59.680
 the level of individual mutations so so basically genes where

39:59.680 --> 40:03.680
 so so you have to think of first the effect of the gene on the disease

40:03.680 --> 40:06.960
 remember how I was sort of painting that map earlier

40:06.960 --> 40:11.200
 from genetics all the way to phenotype that gene

40:11.200 --> 40:15.520
 can have a strong effect on the disease but the genetic variant

40:15.520 --> 40:19.440
 might have a weak effect on the gene so basically

40:19.440 --> 40:23.520
 when you ask what is the effect of that genetic variant

40:23.520 --> 40:27.440
 on the disease it could be that that genetic variant impacts the gene by a

40:27.440 --> 40:30.080
 lot and then the gene impacts the disease by

40:30.080 --> 40:32.320
 a little or it could be that the genetic variants in

40:32.320 --> 40:35.680
 impacts the gene by a little and then the gene impacts the disease by a lot

40:35.680 --> 40:40.640
 so what we care about is genes that impact the disease a lot

40:40.640 --> 40:44.640
 but genetics gives us the full equation and what I would argue

40:44.640 --> 40:51.760
 is if we couple the genetics with expression variation

40:51.760 --> 40:56.480
 to basically ask what genes change by a lot

40:57.440 --> 41:01.120
 and you know which genes correlate with disease by a lot

41:01.120 --> 41:04.480
 even if the genetic variants change them by a little

41:04.480 --> 41:07.600
 then that those are the best places to intervene

41:07.600 --> 41:11.360
 those are the best places where pharmaceutical if I have

41:11.360 --> 41:15.040
 even a modest effect I will have a strong effect on the disease

41:15.040 --> 41:18.000
 whereas those genetic variants that have a huge effect on the disease

41:18.000 --> 41:21.120
 I might not be able to change that gene by this much without affecting all

41:21.120 --> 41:24.560
 kinds of other things interesting so yeah okay so that's what

41:24.560 --> 41:29.280
 we're looking at then what have we been able to find in terms of

41:29.280 --> 41:34.880
 which disease could be helped again and don't get me started

41:34.880 --> 41:40.640
 this is we have found so much our understanding of disease

41:40.640 --> 41:47.360
 has changed so dramatically with genetics I mean places that we had no

41:47.360 --> 41:50.800
 idea would be involved so one of the worst things about

41:50.800 --> 41:53.920
 my genome is that I have a genetic predisposition to

41:53.920 --> 41:58.880
 age related macular degeneration AMD so it's a form of blindness that causes

41:58.880 --> 42:01.600
 you to to lose the central part of your vision

42:01.600 --> 42:05.360
 progressively as you grow older my increased risk

42:05.360 --> 42:08.480
 is fairly small I have an eight percent chance you only have a six percent

42:08.480 --> 42:12.400
 chance you I'm an average yeah by the way when

42:12.400 --> 42:15.840
 you say my you mean literally yours you know this about you

42:15.840 --> 42:20.560
 I know this about me yeah which is kind of

42:20.560 --> 42:24.640
 I mean philosophically speaking is a pretty powerful thing

42:24.640 --> 42:29.440
 so to live with I mean maybe that's so we agreed to talk again by the way for

42:29.440 --> 42:33.920
 the listeners to where we're going to try to focus on science today and a

42:33.920 --> 42:39.120
 little bit of philosophy next time but it's interesting

42:39.120 --> 42:43.280
 to think about the more you're able to know about yourself from the genetic

42:43.280 --> 42:47.040
 information in terms of the diseases how that changes

42:47.040 --> 42:51.840
 your own view of life yeah so there's there's a lot of impact there

42:51.840 --> 42:55.760
 and there's a something called genetic exceptionalism

42:55.760 --> 42:59.840
 which basically thinks of genetics as something very very different

42:59.840 --> 43:05.840
 than everything else as a type of determinism and you know let's talk

43:05.840 --> 43:09.840
 about that next time so basically a good preview yeah

43:09.840 --> 43:13.920
 so let's go back to AMD so basically with AMD

43:13.920 --> 43:18.000
 we have no idea what causes an AMD you know

43:18.000 --> 43:23.440
 it was it was a mystery until the genetics were worked out

43:23.440 --> 43:27.040
 and now the fact that I know that I have a predisposition

43:27.040 --> 43:30.320
 allows me to sort of make some life choices number one

43:30.320 --> 43:34.800
 but number two the genes that lead to that predisposition

43:34.800 --> 43:38.240
 give us insights as to how does it actually work

43:38.240 --> 43:42.800
 and that's a place where genetics gave us something totally unexpected

43:42.800 --> 43:48.800
 so there's a complement pathway which is an immune function pathway

43:48.800 --> 43:55.680
 that was in you know most of the loci associated with AMD

43:55.680 --> 43:59.120
 and that basically told us that wow there's an immune basis

43:59.120 --> 44:04.960
 to this eye disorder that people had just not expected before

44:04.960 --> 44:08.000
 if you look at complement it was recently also

44:08.000 --> 44:14.160
 implicated in schizophrenia and there's a type of microglia

44:14.160 --> 44:18.960
 that is involved in synaptic pruning so synapses are the connections between

44:18.960 --> 44:22.880
 neurons and in this whole use it or lose it view

44:22.880 --> 44:26.960
 of mental cognition and other capabilities

44:26.960 --> 44:31.760
 you basically have microglia which are immune cells that are sort of

44:31.760 --> 44:36.240
 constantly traversing your brain and then pruning neuronal connections

44:36.240 --> 44:40.080
 pruning synaptic connections that are not utilized

44:40.080 --> 44:46.960
 so in schizophrenia there's thought to be a change in the pruning

44:46.960 --> 44:50.960
 that basically if you don't prune your synapses the right way

44:50.960 --> 44:54.240
 you will actually have an increased role of schizophrenia this is something that

44:54.240 --> 44:57.760
 was completely unexpected for schizophrenia of course we knew it

44:57.760 --> 45:01.280
 has to do with neurons but the role of the complement complex

45:01.280 --> 45:05.360
 which is also implicated in AMD which is now also implicated in schizophrenia

45:05.360 --> 45:07.840
 was a huge surprise what's the complement complex

45:07.840 --> 45:11.040
 so it's basically a set of genes the complement genes

45:11.040 --> 45:15.200
 that are basically having various immune roles

45:15.200 --> 45:18.480
 and as I was saying earlier our immune system has been coopted

45:18.480 --> 45:22.960
 for many different roles across the body so they actually play many diverse

45:22.960 --> 45:26.560
 roles somehow the immune system is connected to the

45:26.560 --> 45:31.920
 synaptic pruning process exactly so immune cells were coopted

45:31.920 --> 45:35.520
 to prune synapse how did you figure this out

45:35.520 --> 45:40.080
 how does one go off figuring this intricate connection

45:40.080 --> 45:43.760
 like pipeline of connections out yeah let me give you another example

45:43.760 --> 45:48.320
 so so Alzheimer's disease the first place that you would expect it to act is

45:48.320 --> 45:52.560
 obviously the brain so we had basically this

45:52.560 --> 45:57.840
 roadmap epigenomics consortium view of the human epigenome the largest map of

45:57.840 --> 46:01.680
 the human epigenome that has ever been built

46:01.680 --> 46:05.680
 across 127 different tissues and samples

46:05.680 --> 46:09.040
 with dozens of epigenomic marks measured in you know

46:09.040 --> 46:13.440
 hundreds of donors so what we've basically learned through that

46:13.440 --> 46:16.960
 is that you you basically can map what are the active

46:16.960 --> 46:20.080
 gene regulatory elements for every one of the tissues in the body

46:20.080 --> 46:23.520
 and then we connected these gene regulatory

46:23.520 --> 46:28.320
 active maps of basically what regions of the human genome

46:28.320 --> 46:31.840
 are turning on in every one of different tissues

46:31.840 --> 46:37.680
 we then can go back and say where are all of the genetic loci that are

46:37.680 --> 46:41.680
 associated with disease this is something that my group

46:41.680 --> 46:45.120
 I think was the first to do back in 2010

46:45.120 --> 46:49.280
 in this Ernst Nature biotech paper but basically

46:49.280 --> 46:53.440
 we were for the first time able to show that specific chromatin states specific

46:53.440 --> 46:56.800
 epigenomic states in that case enhancers were in fact

46:56.800 --> 47:00.560
 enriched enriched in disease associated variants

47:00.560 --> 47:05.360
 we pushed that further in the Ernst Nature paper a year later

47:05.360 --> 47:09.600
 and then in this roadmap epigenomics paper

47:09.600 --> 47:13.520
 you know a few years after that but basically that matrix

47:13.520 --> 47:17.280
 that you mentioned earlier was in fact the first time that we could see

47:17.280 --> 47:22.320
 what genetic traits have genetic variants that are enriched

47:22.320 --> 47:28.160
 in what tissues in the body and a lot of that map made complete

47:28.160 --> 47:31.120
 sense if you looked at a diversity of immune

47:31.120 --> 47:34.720
 traits like allergies and type 1 diabetes and so on so forth

47:34.720 --> 47:37.760
 you basically could see that they were enriching

47:37.760 --> 47:41.520
 that the genetic variants associated with those traits were enriched

47:41.520 --> 47:44.640
 in enhancers in these gene regulatory elements

47:44.640 --> 47:49.120
 active in T cells and B cells and hematopoietic stem cells and so on so forth

47:49.120 --> 47:54.880
 so that basically gave us uh confirmation in many ways that those

47:54.880 --> 47:58.880
 immune traits were indeed enriching immune cells

47:58.880 --> 48:02.480
 if you look if you if you looked at type 2 diabetes

48:02.480 --> 48:06.000
 you basically saw an enrichment in only one type of sample

48:06.000 --> 48:11.280
 and it was pancreatic islets and we know that type 2 diabetes

48:11.280 --> 48:14.720
 you know sort of stems from the dysregulation of insulin

48:14.720 --> 48:18.320
 in the beta cells of pancreatic islets and that sort of was

48:18.320 --> 48:22.640
 you know spot on super precise if you looked at blood pressure

48:22.640 --> 48:25.680
 where would you expect blood pressure to occur

48:25.680 --> 48:29.040
 you know I don't know maybe in your metabolism in ways that you process

48:29.040 --> 48:32.240
 coffee or something like that maybe in your brain the way that you stress out

48:32.240 --> 48:35.440
 and increases your blood pressure etc what we found is that blood pressure

48:35.440 --> 48:38.880
 localized specifically in the left ventricle

48:38.880 --> 48:42.640
 of the heart so the enhancers of the left rectum in the heart

48:42.640 --> 48:46.560
 contained a lot of genetic variants associated with blood pressure

48:46.560 --> 48:50.400
 if you look at height we found an enrichment specifically

48:50.400 --> 48:54.800
 in embryonic stem cell enhancers so the genetic variants predisposing you to

48:54.800 --> 48:59.280
 be taller or shorter are in fact acting in developmental stem cells

48:59.280 --> 49:03.280
 makes complete sense if you looked at inflammatory bowel disease

49:03.280 --> 49:06.560
 you basically found inflammatory which is immune

49:06.560 --> 49:10.800
 and also bowel disease which is digestive and indeed we show a double

49:10.800 --> 49:14.880
 enrichment both in the immune cells and in the digestive

49:14.880 --> 49:18.720
 cells so that basically told us that I have this is acting in both components

49:18.720 --> 49:21.600
 there's an immune component in commentary bowel disease and there's a

49:21.600 --> 49:25.760
 digestive component and the big surprise was for Alzheimer's

49:25.760 --> 49:29.760
 we had seven different brain samples we found

49:29.760 --> 49:34.560
 zero enrichment in the brain samples for genetic variants associated with

49:34.560 --> 49:37.760
 Alzheimer's and this is mind boggling

49:37.760 --> 49:41.680
 our brains were literally hurting what is going on

49:41.680 --> 49:44.480
 and what is going on is that the brain samples

49:44.480 --> 49:48.800
 are primarily neurons oligodendrocytes

49:48.800 --> 49:53.840
 and astrocytes in terms of the cell types that make them up

49:53.840 --> 49:57.760
 so that basically indicated that genetic variants associated with

49:57.760 --> 50:01.600
 Alzheimer's were probably not acting in

50:01.600 --> 50:06.080
 oligodendrocytes astrocytes or neurons so what could they be acting in

50:06.080 --> 50:09.520
 well the fourth major cell type is actually microglia

50:09.520 --> 50:13.600
 microglia are resident immune cells in your brain

50:13.600 --> 50:20.480
 oh nice the immune oh wow and they are cd14 plus which is this

50:20.480 --> 50:25.520
 sort of cell surface markers of those cells so they're cd14 plus cells just

50:25.520 --> 50:30.000
 like microphages that are circulating in your blood

50:30.000 --> 50:33.760
 the microglia are resident monocytes

50:33.760 --> 50:37.360
 that are basically sitting in your brain they're tissue specific

50:37.360 --> 50:41.280
 monocytes and every one of your tissues like your your your fat for example

50:41.280 --> 50:46.640
 has a lot of macrophages that are resin and the m1 versus m2 macrophage ratio

50:46.640 --> 50:50.720
 has a huge role to play in obesity and you know so basically again these

50:50.720 --> 50:53.440
 immune cells are everywhere but basically what we found

50:53.440 --> 50:58.240
 through this completely unbiased view of what are the tissues that likely

50:58.240 --> 51:03.120
 underlie different disorders we found that Alzheimer's

51:03.120 --> 51:08.880
 was humongously enriched in microglia but not at all in the other cell types

51:08.880 --> 51:13.040
 so what what are we supposed to make that if you look at the

51:13.040 --> 51:18.000
 tissues involved is that simply useful for indication

51:18.000 --> 51:24.400
 of propensity for disease or does it give us somehow a pathway of treatment

51:24.400 --> 51:29.200
 it's very much the second if you look at the

51:29.200 --> 51:33.600
 um the the way to therapeutics you have to start somewhere

51:33.600 --> 51:36.960
 what are you going to do you're going to basically make assays

51:36.960 --> 51:44.160
 that manipulate those genes and those pathways in those cell types so

51:44.160 --> 51:49.040
 before we know the tissue of action we don't even know where to start

51:49.040 --> 51:52.400
 we basically are at a loss but if you know the tissue of action

51:52.400 --> 51:55.040
 and even better if you know the pathway of action

51:55.040 --> 51:58.080
 then you can basically screen your small molecules

51:58.080 --> 52:01.600
 not for the gene you can screen them directly for the pathway

52:01.600 --> 52:07.040
 in that cell type so you can basically develop a high throughput multiplexed

52:07.040 --> 52:12.800
 you know robotic system for testing the impact of your favorite molecules

52:12.800 --> 52:16.800
 that you know are safe efficacious and you know sort of hit that particular

52:16.800 --> 52:21.600
 gene and so and so forth you can basically screen those molecules

52:21.600 --> 52:25.760
 against either a set of genes that act in that pathway

52:25.760 --> 52:29.520
 or on the pathway directly by having a cellular assay

52:29.520 --> 52:32.960
 and then you can basically go into mice and do experiments and basically sort

52:32.960 --> 52:36.160
 of figure out ways to manipulate these processes

52:36.160 --> 52:39.600
 that allow you to then to go back to humans and do a clinical trial that

52:39.600 --> 52:43.840
 basically says okay i was able indeed to reverse these processes in mice

52:43.840 --> 52:48.960
 can i do the same thing in humans so that the the knowledge of the tissues

52:48.960 --> 52:52.560
 gives you the pathway to treatment but that's not the only part

52:52.560 --> 52:56.800
 there are many additional steps to figuring out the mechanism of disease

52:56.800 --> 53:02.160
 i mean so that's really promising maybe uh to take a small step back you've

53:02.160 --> 53:06.400
 mentioned all these puzzles that were figured out with the nature paper

53:06.400 --> 53:11.600
 for me you've mentioned a ton of diseases

53:11.600 --> 53:15.920
 from obesity to Alzheimer's even schizophrenia i think you mentioned

53:15.920 --> 53:20.480
 is just uh what is the actual methodology of figuring this out

53:20.480 --> 53:24.480
 so indeed i mentioned a lot of diseases and and my lab works on a lot of

53:24.480 --> 53:27.760
 different disorders and the reason for that

53:27.760 --> 53:33.520
 is that if you look at the

53:33.600 --> 53:39.440
 if you look at biology it used to be you know zoology departments and

53:39.440 --> 53:42.800
 botanology departments and you know virology departments and so on and so

53:42.800 --> 53:46.560
 forth and MIT was one of the first schools to basically create a biology

53:46.560 --> 53:49.440
 department like oh we're gonna study all of life suddenly

53:49.440 --> 53:54.080
 why was that even a case because the advent of DNA

53:54.080 --> 53:58.480
 and the genome and the central dogma of DNA makes RNA makes protein

53:58.480 --> 54:02.320
 in many ways unified biology you could suddenly

54:02.320 --> 54:06.800
 study the process of transcription in viruses or in bacteria

54:06.800 --> 54:12.000
 and have a huge impact on yeast and fly and maybe even mammals

54:12.000 --> 54:17.360
 because of this realization of these common underlying processes

54:17.360 --> 54:22.400
 and in the same way that DNA unified biology

54:22.400 --> 54:29.040
 genetics is unifying disease studies so you used to have

54:29.040 --> 54:34.400
 um you used to have uh you know i don't know um

54:34.400 --> 54:39.440
 cardiovascular disease department and uh you know neurological disease

54:39.440 --> 54:43.280
 department and you know the generation department and

54:43.280 --> 54:48.160
 you know um basically immune and cancer and so on so forth

54:48.160 --> 54:51.200
 and all of these were studied in different labs

54:51.200 --> 54:54.320
 you know because it made sense because we basically the first step was

54:54.320 --> 54:57.520
 understanding how the tissue functions and we kind of knew the tissues

54:57.520 --> 55:00.400
 involved in cardiovascular disease and so on so forth

55:00.400 --> 55:03.920
 but what's happening with human genetics is that all of that all of these

55:03.920 --> 55:08.240
 walls and edifices that we had built are crumbling

55:08.240 --> 55:11.680
 and the reason for that is that genetics

55:11.680 --> 55:16.400
 is in many ways revealing unexpected connections

55:16.400 --> 55:18.960
 so suddenly we now have to bring the immunologists

55:18.960 --> 55:22.480
 to work on Alzheimer's they were never in their room

55:22.480 --> 55:28.000
 they were in another building altogether the same way for schizophrenia

55:28.000 --> 55:31.920
 we now have to sort of worry about all these interconnected

55:31.920 --> 55:37.280
 aspects for metabolic disorders we're finding contributions from brain

55:37.280 --> 55:39.840
 so suddenly we have to call the neurologists from the other building

55:39.840 --> 55:45.920
 and so on so forth so in my view it makes no sense anymore

55:45.920 --> 55:50.560
 to basically say oh i'm a geneticist studying immune disorders

55:50.560 --> 55:54.240
 i mean that's that's ridiculous because i mean yeah of course in many ways

55:54.240 --> 55:58.560
 you still need to sort of focus but what what what we're doing is that we're

55:58.560 --> 56:02.080
 basically saying we'll go wherever the genetics takes us

56:02.080 --> 56:07.040
 and by building these massive resources by working on

56:07.040 --> 56:12.560
 our latest map is now 833 tissues sort of the the next generation of

56:12.560 --> 56:15.360
 the epitomics roadmap which we're now called epimap

56:15.360 --> 56:20.080
 is 833 different tissues and using those we've basically found

56:20.080 --> 56:25.840
 enrichments in 540 different disorders those enrichments are not like oh

56:25.840 --> 56:29.120
 great you guys work on that and we'll work on this

56:29.120 --> 56:34.400
 they're intertwined amazingly so of course there's a lot of modularity

56:34.400 --> 56:37.760
 but there's these enhancers that are sort of broadly active and these disorders

56:37.760 --> 56:41.760
 that are broadly active so basically some enhancers are active in old tissues

56:41.760 --> 56:46.240
 and some disorders are enriching in old tissues so basically there's these

56:46.240 --> 56:49.280
 multifactorial and this other class which i like to call

56:49.280 --> 56:54.160
 polyfactorial diseases which are basically lighting up everywhere

56:54.160 --> 56:59.360
 and in many ways it's you know sort of cutting across these walls that were

56:59.360 --> 57:03.280
 previously built across these departments and the polyfactorial ones were

57:03.280 --> 57:06.480
 probably the previous structure departments wasn't

57:06.480 --> 57:12.240
 equipped to deal with those i mean again maybe it's a romanticized

57:12.240 --> 57:16.720
 question but you know there's in physics there's a theory of everything

57:16.720 --> 57:20.720
 do you think it's possible to move towards an almost

57:20.720 --> 57:23.920
 theory of everything of disease from a genetic perspective

57:23.920 --> 57:28.000
 so if this unification continues is it possible that

57:28.000 --> 57:31.280
 like do you think in those terms like trying to arrive

57:31.280 --> 57:35.440
 at a fundamental understanding of how disease emerges period

57:35.440 --> 57:39.520
 that unification is not just foreseeable

57:39.520 --> 57:43.440
 it's inevitable i see it as inevitable

57:43.440 --> 57:47.280
 we have to go there you cannot be a specialist

57:47.280 --> 57:51.360
 anymore if you're a genomicist you have to be a specialist

57:51.360 --> 57:56.240
 in every single disorder and the reason for that is that

57:56.240 --> 58:00.720
 the fundamental understanding of the circuitry of the human genome

58:00.720 --> 58:07.360
 that you need to solve schizophrenia that fundamental circuitry is hugely

58:07.360 --> 58:10.960
 important to solve Alzheimer's and that same circuitry is hugely

58:10.960 --> 58:14.800
 important to solve metabolic disorders and that same exact circuitry

58:14.800 --> 58:19.280
 is hugely important for solving immune disorders and cancer

58:19.280 --> 58:23.680
 and you know every single disease so all of them

58:23.680 --> 58:29.440
 have the same sub task and i teach dynamic programming in my class

58:29.440 --> 58:34.160
 dynamic program is all about sort of not redoing the work

58:34.160 --> 58:39.680
 it's reusing the work that you do once so basically for us to say oh great

58:39.680 --> 58:43.600
 you know you guys in the immune building go solve the fundamental circuitry of

58:43.600 --> 58:46.160
 everything and then you guys in the schizophrenia building go

58:46.160 --> 58:49.040
 solve the fundamental circuitry of everything separately

58:49.040 --> 58:52.560
 is crazy so what we need to do is come together

58:52.560 --> 58:57.360
 and sort of have a circuitry group the circuitry building that sort of tries

58:57.360 --> 59:01.600
 to solve the circuitry of everything and then the immune folks

59:01.600 --> 59:05.840
 who will apply this knowledge to all of the disorders that are

59:05.840 --> 59:11.280
 associated with immune dysfunction and the schizophrenia folks

59:11.280 --> 59:14.560
 will basically interacting with both the immune folks and with the neuronal

59:14.560 --> 59:16.800
 folks and all of them will be interacting with the

59:16.800 --> 59:20.000
 circuitry folks and so on so forth so that's sort of the current

59:20.000 --> 59:23.520
 structure of my group if you wish so basically what we're doing is

59:23.520 --> 59:29.360
 focusing on the fundamental circuitry but at the same time we're the users

59:29.360 --> 59:33.360
 of our own tools by collaborating with

59:33.360 --> 59:37.200
 many other labs in every one of these disorders that we mentioned

59:37.200 --> 59:41.760
 we basically have a heart focus on cardiovascular disease coronary artery

59:41.760 --> 59:47.360
 disease heart failure and so forth we have an immune focus on

59:47.360 --> 59:51.120
 several immune disorders we have a cancer focus

59:51.120 --> 59:55.440
 on uh metastatic melanoma and immunotherapy response

59:55.440 --> 1:00:02.400
 we have a psychiatric disease focus on schizophrenia autism ptsd

1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:06.080
 and other psychiatric disorders we have an Alzheimer's and neurodegeneration

1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:10.400
 focus on hunting to disease ALS and you know

1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:13.600
 AD related disorders like frontal temporal dementia and louis body

1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:16.560
 dementia and of course a huge focus on Alzheimer's

1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:19.920
 we have a metabolic focus on the role of exercise

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:24.960
 and diets and sort of how they're impacting metabolic

1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:28.880
 you know organs across the body and across many different tissues

1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:33.840
 and all of them are interfacing with the circuitry

1:00:33.840 --> 1:00:38.000
 and the reason for that is another computer science principle

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:44.800
 of eat your own dog food if everybody ate their own dog food

1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:48.320
 dog food would taste a lot better the reason why

1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:53.200
 microsoft excel and word and powerpoint was so important

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:57.120
 and so successful is because the employees

1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:01.280
 that were working on them were using them for their day to day tasks

1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:04.240
 you can't just simply build a circuitry and say

1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:08.160
 here it is guys take the circuitry we're done without being the

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:11.040
 users of that circuitry because you then go back

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:15.840
 and because we span the whole spectrum from profiling the epigenome

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:19.760
 using comparative genomics finding the important nucleotide in the genome

1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:24.320
 building the basic functional map of what are the genes in the human genome

1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:27.440
 what are the gene regulatory elements of the human genome

1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:31.280
 i mean over the years we've written a series of papers on how do you find human

1:01:31.280 --> 1:01:33.840
 genes in the first place using comparative genomics

1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:38.000
 how do you find the motifs that are the building blocks of gene regulation

1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:42.880
 using comparative genomics how do you then find how these motifs come together

1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:48.560
 and act in specific tissues using epigenomics how do you link regulators

1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:52.160
 to enhancers and enhancers to their target genes

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:55.520
 using epigenomics and regulatory genomics so

1:01:55.520 --> 1:01:59.040
 through the years we've basically built all this infrastructure

1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:05.120
 for understanding what i like to say every single nucleotide of the human genome

1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:10.320
 and how it acts in every one of the major cell types and tissues of the human body

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:14.480
 i mean this is no small task this is an enormous task that takes the entire

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:17.920
 field and that's something that my group has taken on

1:02:17.920 --> 1:02:22.160
 along with many other groups and we have also

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:25.840
 and that sort of a thing sets my group perhaps apart we have also worked

1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:28.640
 with specialists in every one of these disorders

1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:32.320
 to basically further our understanding all the way down to disease

1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:35.600
 and in some cases collaborating with pharma to go all the way down to

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:39.840
 therapeutics because of our deep deep understanding

1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:45.600
 of that basic circuitry and how it allows us to now improve the

1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:49.040
 circuitry not just treat it as a black box but

1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:53.440
 basically go and say okay we need a better cell type specific wiring

1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:57.680
 that we now have at the tissue specific level so we're focusing on that

1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:01.600
 because we're understanding you know the needs from the disease front

1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:06.720
 so you have a sense of the entire pipeline i mean one

1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:10.640
 maybe you can indulge me one nice question to ask would be

1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:15.360
 how do you from the scientific perspective go from knowing nothing

1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:21.040
 about the disease to going you said to go into the

1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:25.840
 entire pipeline and actually have a drug or or a treatment that cures that

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:29.920
 disease so that's an enormously long path

1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:35.760
 and an enormously great challenge and what i'm trying to argue is that

1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:38.800
 it progresses in stages of understanding

1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:42.640
 rather than one gene at a time the traditional view of biology was

1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:46.160
 you have one postdoc working on this gene and another postdoc working on that

1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:49.200
 gene and they'll just figure out everything about

1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:52.960
 that gene and that's their job what we've realized is how

1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:57.520
 polygenic the diseases are so we can't have one postdoc per

1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:02.960
 gene anymore we now have to have these cross cutting

1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:06.400
 needs and i'm going to describe the path

1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:12.880
 to circuitry along those needs and every single one of these paths

1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:16.800
 we are now doing in parallel across thousands of genes

1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:21.600
 so the first step is you have a genetic association

1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:24.720
 and we talked a little bit about sort of the Mendelian path

1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:28.720
 and the polygenic path to that association so the Mendelian path was

1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:32.960
 looking through families to basically find gene regions

1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:36.640
 and ultimately genes that are underlying particular disorders

1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:40.480
 the polygenic path is basically looking at

1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:44.000
 unrelated individuals in this giant matrix of genotype

1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.920
 by phenotype and then finding hits where a particular variant

1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:54.080
 impacts disease all the way to the end and then we now have a connection not

1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:58.960
 between a gene and a disease but between a genetic region and a

1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:03.280
 disease and that distinction is not understood by most people

1:05:03.280 --> 1:05:06.480
 so i'm going to explain it a little bit more

1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:09.840
 why do we not have a connection between a gene

1:05:09.840 --> 1:05:13.360
 and a disease but we have a connection between a genetic region and a disease

1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:19.760
 the reason for that is that 93 percent of genetic variants

1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:26.880
 that are associated with disease don't impact the protein at all

1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:29.760
 so if you look at the human genome there's 20 000 genes

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:36.800
 there's 3.2 billion nucleotides only 1.5 percent of the genome

1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:45.920
 codes for proteins the other 98.5 percent does not code for proteins

1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:50.800
 if you now look at where are the disease variants located

1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:55.520
 93 percent of them fall in that outside the gene's portion

1:05:55.520 --> 1:06:00.320
 of course genes are enriched but they're only enriched by a factor of three

1:06:00.320 --> 1:06:03.520
 that means that still 93 percent of genetic variants

1:06:03.520 --> 1:06:09.280
 fall outside the proteins why is that difficult why is that a problem

1:06:09.280 --> 1:06:14.000
 the problem is that when a variant falls outside the gene

1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:17.760
 you don't know what gene is impacted by that variant you can't just say oh

1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:20.880
 it's near this gene let's just connect that variant to the gene

1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:24.240
 and the reason for that is that the genome circuitry

1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:30.480
 is very often long range so you basically have that genetic variant

1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:35.760
 that could sit in the intron of one gene and an intron is sort of the

1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:39.600
 the place between the exons that code for proteins so proteins are split up

1:06:39.600 --> 1:06:43.760
 into exons and introns and every exon codes for a particular subset of

1:06:43.760 --> 1:06:46.720
 amino acids and together they're spliced together

1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:50.800
 and then make the final protein so that genetic variant might be sitting in an

1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:53.520
 intron of a gene it's transcribed with the gene

1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:56.960
 it's processed and then excised but it might not impact this gene at all

1:06:56.960 --> 1:07:01.040
 it might actually impact another gene that's a million nucleotides away so

1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:03.840
 it's just riding along even though it has nothing to do with the

1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:07.440
 with this nearby neighborhood that's exactly right

1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:12.240
 let me give you an example the strongest genetic association with obesity

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:18.240
 was discovered in this FTO gene fat and obesity associated gene

1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:26.560
 so this FTO gene was studied ad nauseam people did tons of experiments on it

1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:32.080
 they figured out that FTO is in fact a RNA methylation

1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:36.560
 transferase it basically it sort of impacts something that we know

1:07:36.560 --> 1:07:40.640
 that we call the epitranscriptome just like the genome can be modified

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:43.440
 the transcriptome the transcripts of the genes

1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:47.040
 can be modified and we basically said oh great that means that

1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:50.640
 that epitranscriptomics is hugely involved in obesity because that

1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:56.720
 that gene FTO is you know clearly where the genetic locus is at

1:07:56.720 --> 1:08:02.480
 my group studied FTO in collaboration with you know a wonderful team led by

1:08:02.480 --> 1:08:08.320
 Melina Klausnitzer and what we found is that this FTO locus

1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:11.600
 even though it is associated with obesity

1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:16.400
 does not implicate the FTO gene

1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:20.800
 the genetic variant sits in the first intran of the FTO gene

1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:27.360
 but it controls two genes IRX3 and IRX5 that are sitting

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:32.960
 1.2 million nucleotides away several genes away

1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:37.040
 oh boy uh what am i supposed to feel about that because isn't that like super

1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:40.160
 complicated then uh so so the way that i was introduced at a

1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:43.840
 conference a few years ago was uh and here's Manolis Kelis who

1:08:43.840 --> 1:08:48.480
 wrote the most depressing paper of 2015

1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:51.280
 and the reason for that is that the entire pharmaceutical industry was so

1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:55.840
 comfortable that there was a single gene in that locus

1:08:55.840 --> 1:08:59.200
 because in some loci you basically have three dozen genes that are all sitting

1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:02.960
 in the same region of association and you're like oh gosh which ones of those

1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:05.520
 is it but even that question of which ones of

1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:08.160
 those is it is making the assumption that it is

1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:12.640
 one of those as opposed to some random gene just far far away

1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:16.720
 which is what our paper showed so basically what our paper showed is that

1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:20.960
 you can't ignore the circuitry you have to first figure out the circuitry

1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:25.200
 all of those long range interactions how every genetic variant impacts the

1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:28.480
 expression of every gene in every tissue imaginable

1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:32.800
 across hundreds of individuals and then you now have

1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:36.240
 one of the building blocks not even all of the building blocks for then going

1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:43.280
 and understanding disease so okay so embrace the the

1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:47.520
 wholeness of the circuitry correct but what so back to the question of

1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:51.520
 starting knowing nothing to the disease and and go into the treatment

1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:55.040
 so what are the next steps so you basically have to first figure out the

1:09:55.040 --> 1:09:57.440
 tissue and then describe how you figure out the

1:09:57.440 --> 1:09:59.840
 tissue you figure out the tissue by taking all of these

1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:03.040
 noncoding variants that are sitting outside proteins

1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:06.560
 and then figuring out what are the epigenomic enrichments

1:10:06.560 --> 1:10:12.400
 and the reason for that you know thankfully is that there is convergence

1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:19.200
 that the same processes are impacted in different ways by different loci

1:10:19.200 --> 1:10:25.200
 and that's a saving grace for our field the fact that if I look at hundreds of

1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:29.040
 genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's they localize

1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:35.040
 in a small number of processes can you clarify why that's hopeful so like they

1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:39.280
 show up in the same exact way in the in the specific set of

1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:42.080
 processes yeah so so basically there's a small

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:45.920
 number of biological processes that underlie or at least that play them the

1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:49.600
 biggest role in every disorder so in Alzheimer's

1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:53.760
 you basically have you know maybe 10 different types of processes

1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:58.640
 one of them is lipid metabolism one of them is immune cell function

1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:03.600
 one of them is neuronal energetics so these are just a small number of

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:06.880
 processes but you have multiple lesions

1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:10.800
 multiple genetic perturbations that are associated with those processes

1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:14.400
 so if you look at schizophrenia it's excitatory neuron function it's

1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:17.200
 inhibitory neuron function it's synaptic pruning it's calcium

1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:22.000
 signaling and so on so forth so when you look at disease genetics

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.240
 you have one hit here and one hit there and one hit there and one hit there

1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:29.680
 completely different parts of the genome but it turns out all of those he

1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:33.360
 hits are calcium signaling proteins oh cool you're like

1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:37.200
 aha that means that calcium signaling is important

1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:41.040
 so those people who are focusing on one focus at a time cannot possibly

1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:45.040
 see that picture you have to become a genomicist you have to

1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:49.040
 look at the omics the om the holistic picture

1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:53.920
 to understand these enrichments but you you mentioned the convergence thing so

1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:58.160
 the whatever the thing associated with the disease shows up

1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:03.360
 so let me explain convergence yeah convergence is such a beautiful concept

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:07.280
 so you basically have these four genes

1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:12.240
 that are converging on calcium signaling

1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:16.400
 so that basically means that they are acting each in their own way

1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:20.400
 but together in the same process but now

1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:24.240
 in every one of these low side you have many

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:29.360
 enhancers controlling each of those genes that's another type of convergence

1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:33.680
 where dysregulation of seven different enhancers might all converge

1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:37.120
 on dysregulation of that one gene which then converges

1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:40.800
 on calcium signaling and in each one of those enhancers

1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:44.560
 you might have multiple genetic variants distributed across

1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:49.520
 many different people everyone has their own different mutation

1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:53.120
 but all of these mutations are impacting that enhancer and all of these

1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:56.240
 enhancers are impacting that gene and all of these genes are impacting this

1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:59.760
 pathway and all these pathways are acting the same tissue

1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:03.520
 and all of these tissues are converging together on the same biological process

1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:07.680
 of schizophrenia and you're saying the saving grace

1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:10.880
 is that that convergence seems to happen for a lot of these diseases

1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:15.280
 for all of them basically that for every single disease that we've looked at

1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:19.360
 we have found an epigenomic enrichment how do you do that

1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:23.840
 you basically have all of the genetic variants associated with the disorder

1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:27.840
 and then you're asking for all of the enhancers active in a particular tissue

1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:31.760
 for 540 disorders we've basically found that

1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:35.040
 indeed there is an enrichment that basically means that

1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:38.960
 there is commonality and from the commonality we can just

1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:43.120
 get insights so to explain in the mathematical terms

1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:46.960
 we're basically building an empirical prior

1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:51.520
 we're using a Bayesian approach to basically say great all of these variants

1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:55.920
 are equally likely in a particular locus to be important

1:13:55.920 --> 1:13:59.600
 in a genetic so in a genetic locus you basically have

1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:04.320
 a dozen variants that are co inherited because the way that inheritance works

1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:08.560
 in the human genome is through all of these recombination events

1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:12.880
 during meiosis you basically have you know

1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:17.600
 you inherit maybe three chromosome three for example in your body

1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:21.280
 he's inherited from four different parts one part comes from your

1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:24.240
 dad another part comes from your mom another part comes from your dad and

1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:27.760
 another part comes from your mom so basically the way that it

1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:32.320
 sorry from your mom's mom so you basically have one copy that

1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:35.120
 comes from your dad and one copy that comes from your mom but that copy that

1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:38.720
 you got from your mom is a mixture of her maternal

1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:42.240
 and her paternal chromosome and the copy that you got from your dad is a

1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:48.080
 mixture of his maternal and his paternal chromosome. So these breakpoints that happen

1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:54.560
 when chromosomes are lining up are basically ensuring through these crossover events,

1:14:54.560 --> 1:15:03.120
 they're ensuring that every child cell during the process of meiosis where you basically have

1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:10.320
 one spermatozoid that basically couples with one ovule to basically create one egg to basically

1:15:10.320 --> 1:15:15.920
 create the zygote. You basically have half of your genome that comes from dad and half your

1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:20.240
 genome that comes from mom, but in order to line them up, you basically have these crossover

1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:26.960
 events. These crossover events are basically leading to co inheritance of that entire block

1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:32.880
 coming from your maternal grandmother and that entire block coming from your maternal grandfather.

1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:39.680
 Over many generations, these crossover events don't happen randomly. There's a protein called

1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:47.120
 PRDM9 that basically guides the double stranded breaks and then leads to these crossovers

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:54.000
 and that protein has a particular preference to only a small number of hotspots of recombination

1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:00.000
 which then leads to a small number of breaks between these co inheritance patterns. So even

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:07.520
 though there are six million variants, there are six million loci, this variation is inherited in

1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:13.920
 blocks and every one of these blocks has like two dozen genetic variants that are all associated.

1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:20.400
 So in the case of FTO, it wasn't just one variant, it was 89 common variants that were all

1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:27.280
 humongously associated with obesity. Which ones of those is the important one? Well, if you look

1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:33.280
 at only one locus, you have no idea, but if you look at many loci, you basically say, aha,

1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:42.720
 all of them are enriching in the same epigenomic map. In that particular case, it was mesenchymal

1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:49.920
 stem cells. So these are the progenitor cells that give rise to your brown fat and your white fat.

1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:53.840
 Progenitors like the early on developmental stem cells.

1:16:53.840 --> 1:16:58.800
 So you start from one zygote and that's a tautipotent cell type. It can do anything.

1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:08.240
 You then, you know, that cell divides, divides, divides, and then every cell division is leading

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:14.880
 to specialization where you now have a mesodermal lineage and ectodermal lineage and endodermal

1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:20.880
 lineage that basically leads to different parts of your body. The ectoderm will basically give

1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:27.920
 rise to your skin. Ecto means outside, derm is skin. So ectoderm, but it also gives rise to

1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:32.800
 your neurons and your whole brain. So that's a lot of ectoderm. Mesoderm gives rise to your

1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:38.400
 internal organs, including the vasculature and, you know, your muscle and stuff like that. So

1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:45.200
 you basically have this progressive differentiation. And then if you look further, further down that

1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:50.560
 lineage, you basically have one lineage that will give rise to both your muscle and your bone,

1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:57.120
 but also your fat. And if you go further down the lineage of your fat, you basically have your

1:17:57.120 --> 1:18:02.960
 white fat cells. These are the cells that store energy. So when you eat a lot, but you don't

1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:08.400
 exercise too much, there's an excess set of calories, excess energy. What do you do with those?

1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:13.200
 You basically create, you spend a lot of that energy to create these high energy molecules,

1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:21.120
 lipids, which you can then burn when you need them on a rainy day. So that leads to obesity

1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:27.200
 if you don't exercise and if you overeat, because your body is like, oh, great, I have all these

1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:30.480
 calories. I'm going to store them. Ooh, more calories. I'm going to store them too. Ooh,

1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:39.920
 more calories. And the, you know, 42% of European chromosomes have a predisposition to storing fat,

1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:47.840
 which was selected probably in the, you know, food scarcity periods. Like basically as we were

1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:53.520
 exiting Africa, you know, before and during the ice ages, you know, there was probably a selection

1:18:53.520 --> 1:18:59.360
 to those individuals who made it north to basically be able to store energy, you know, a lot more

1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:07.040
 energy. So you basically now have this lineage that is deciding whether you want to store energy

1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:14.880
 in your white fat or burn energy in your beige fat. Turns out that your fat is, you know, like

1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:21.600
 we, we have such a bad view of fat. Fat is your best friend. Fat can both store all these excess

1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:26.800
 lipids that would be otherwise circulating through your, you know, body and causing damage,

1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:33.120
 but it can also burn calories directly. If you have too much of energy, you can just choose to

1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:39.200
 just burn some of that as heat. So basically when you're cold, you're burning energy to basically

1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:42.480
 warm your body up and you're burning all these lipids and you're burning all these caters.

1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:50.800
 Burning all these caters. So what we basically found is that across the board, genetic variants

1:19:50.800 --> 1:19:56.240
 associated with obesity across many of these regions were all enriched repeatedly in mesenchymal,

1:19:56.240 --> 1:20:03.280
 stem cell enhancers. So that gave us a hint as to which of these genetic variants was likely

1:20:03.280 --> 1:20:12.240
 driving this whole association. And we ended up with this one genetic variant called RS142,

1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:20.080
 1085. And that genetic variant out of the 89 was the one that we predicted to be causal for the

1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:26.240
 disease. So going back to those steps, first step is figure out the relevant tissue based on the

1:20:26.240 --> 1:20:33.360
 global enrichment. Second step is figure out the causal variant among many variants in this

1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:38.880
 linkage disequilibrium in this co inherited block between these recombination hotspots,

1:20:38.880 --> 1:20:45.040
 these boundaries of these inherited blocks. That's the second step. The third step is once you know

1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:51.920
 that causal variant, try to figure out what is the motif that is disrupted by that causal variant.

1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:57.120
 Basically, how does it act? Variants don't just disrupt elements, they disrupt the binding of

1:20:57.120 --> 1:21:03.920
 specific regulators. So basically the third step there was how do you find the motif that is responsible

1:21:03.920 --> 1:21:10.480
 like the gene regulatory word, the building block of gene regulation that is responsible for that

1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:16.400
 dysregulatory event. And the fourth step is finding out what regulator normally binds that motif

1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:21.920
 and is now no longer able to bind. And then once you have the regulator, can you then try to figure

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:29.520
 out how to what after developed how to fix it? That's exactly right. You now know how to intervene.

1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:34.560
 You have basically a regulator, you have a gene that you can then perturb and you say, well,

1:21:34.560 --> 1:21:40.000
 maybe that regulator has a global role in obesity. I can perturb the regulator.

1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:47.680
 Just to clarify, when we say perturbed, on the scale of a human life, can a human being be helped?

1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:51.920
 Of course. Of course. Yeah. I guess understanding is the first step.

1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:57.440
 No, no, but perturbed basically means you now develop therapeutics, pharmaceutical therapeutics

1:21:57.440 --> 1:22:02.320
 against that. Or you develop other types of intervention that affect the expression of that

1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:11.200
 gene. What do pharmaceutical therapeutics look like when your understanding is on a genetic level?

1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:14.080
 Yeah. Sorry if it's a dumb question. No, no, no. It's a brilliant question,

1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:17.520
 but I want to save it for a little bit later when we start talking about therapeutics.

1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:22.960
 Perfect. We've talked about the first four steps. There's two more. So basically the first step is

1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:28.800
 figure out the zero step. The starting point is the genetics. The first step after that is figure

1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:35.200
 out the tissue of action. The second step is figuring out the nucleotide that is responsible

1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:39.760
 or set of nucleotides. The third step is figuring out the motif and the upstream regulator,

1:22:39.760 --> 1:22:45.600
 number four. Number five and six is what are the targets? So number five is great.

1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:50.160
 Now I know the regulator, I know the motif, I know the tissue, and I know the variant.

1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:56.080
 What does it actually do? So you have to now trace it to the biological process

1:22:56.800 --> 1:23:03.040
 and the genes that mediate that biological process. So knowing all of this can now allow

1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:09.920
 you to find the target genes. How? By basically doing perturbation experiments or by looking

1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:17.360
 at the folding of the epigenome or by looking at the genetic impact of that genetic variant

1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:23.840
 on the expression of genes. And we use all three. So let me go through them. Basically one of them

1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:30.720
 is physical links. This is the folding of the genome onto itself. How do you even figure out

1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:36.960
 the folding? It's a little bit of a tangent, but it's a super awesome technology. Think of the

1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:43.440
 genome as again this massive packaging that we talked about of taking two meters worth of DNA

1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:49.520
 and putting it in something that's a million times smaller than two meters worth of DNA,

1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:54.800
 that's a single cell. You basically have this massive packaging and this packaging basically

1:23:54.800 --> 1:24:02.320
 leads to the chromosome being wrapped around in sort of tight, tight ways. In ways, however,

1:24:02.320 --> 1:24:10.240
 that are functionally capable of being reopened and reclosed. So I can then go in and figure out

1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:17.840
 that folding by sort of chopping up the spaghetti soup, putting glue and ligating the segments that

1:24:17.840 --> 1:24:24.000
 were chopped up but nearby each other, and then sequencing through these ligation events to figure

1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:28.080
 out that this region of this chromosome, that region of the chromosome were near each other,

1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:32.000
 that means they were interacting, even though they were far away on the genome itself.

1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:42.560
 So that chopping up sequencing and regluing is basically giving you folds of the genome that

1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:47.280
 we call. Sorry, can you backtrack? Of course. How does cutting it help you figure out

1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:52.080
 which ones were close in the original folding? So you have a bowl of noodles.

1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:59.760
 Go on. And in that bowl of noodles, some noodles are near each other. Yes.

1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:04.720
 So throwing a bunch of glue, you basically freeze the noodles in place,

1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:08.240
 throwing a cutter that chops up the noodles into little pieces.

1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:16.560
 Now, throwing some ligation enzyme that lets those pieces that were free,

1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:22.560
 religate near each other. In some cases, they're religate what you had just got,

1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:30.960
 but that's very rare. Most of the time, they will religate in whatever was proximal. You now have

1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:38.400
 glued the red noodle that was crossing the blue noodle to each other. You then reverse the glue,

1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:43.680
 the glue goes away, and you just sequence the heck out of it. Most of the time,

1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:49.200
 you'll find red segment with, you know, red segment, but you can specifically select for

1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:52.960
 ligation events that have happened that were not from the same segment by sort of marking

1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:58.000
 them in a particular way. And then selecting those, and then you sequence and you look for

1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:03.840
 red with blue matches of sort of things that were glued that were not immediate proximal to

1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:08.800
 each other. And that reveals the linking of the blue noodle and the red noodle. You're with me

1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:13.920
 so far? Yeah. Good. So we, you know, we've done these experiments. That's physical. That's physical.

1:26:13.920 --> 1:26:18.320
 That's step one of the physical. And what the physical revealed is topologically associated

1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:23.680
 domains, basically big blocks of the genome that are topologically connected together.

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:30.720
 That's the physical. The second one is the genetic links. It basically says,

1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:35.120
 across individuals that have different genetic variants,

1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:40.560
 how are their genes expressed differently? Remember, before I was saying that the path

1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:44.640
 between genetics and disease is enormous, but we can break it up to look at the path between

1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:50.880
 genetics and gene expression. So instead of using Alzheimer's as the phenotype, I can now use

1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:59.200
 expression of IRX3 as the phenotype, expression of gene A. And I can look at all of the humans

1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:03.200
 who contain a G at that location and all the humans will contain a T at that location.

1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:07.840
 And basically say, wow, turns out that the expression of the gene is higher for the T

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:13.200
 humans than for the G humans at that location. So that basically gives me a genetic link between

1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:20.400
 a genetic variant, a locus, a region, and the expression of nearby genes. Good on the genetic

1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:26.240
 link? I think so. Awesome. So the third link is the activity link. What's an activity link?

1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:33.280
 It basically says, if I look across 833 different epigenomes, whenever this enhancer is active,

1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:40.560
 this gene is active. That gives me an activity link between this region of the DNA and that gene.

1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:47.280
 And then the fourth one is perturbations, where I can go in and blow up that region and see what

1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:52.240
 are the genes that change in expression. Or I can go in and over activate that region and see what

1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:58.320
 genes change in expression. So I guess that's similar to activity? Yeah. Yeah. So that's

1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:05.200
 similar to activity. I agree, but it's causal rather than correlational. Again, I'm a little weird.

1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:11.040
 No, no, you're 100% on. It's exactly the same as activity perturbation where I go and intervene.

1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:17.360
 Yes. I basically take a bunch of cells. So you know CRISPR, right? CRISPR is this

1:28:18.080 --> 1:28:24.480
 genome guidance and cutting mechanism. It's what George George likes to call genome vandalism.

1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:32.800
 So you basically are able to, you can basically take a guide RNA that you put into the CRISPR

1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:38.400
 system and the CRISPR system will basically use this guide RNA, scan the genome, find wherever

1:28:38.400 --> 1:28:46.240
 there's a match and then cut the genome. So, you know, I digress, but it's a bacterial immune

1:28:46.240 --> 1:28:53.840
 defense system. So basically bacteria are constantly attacked by viruses, but sometimes they win

1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:59.600
 against the viruses and they chop up these viruses and remember as a trophy inside their genome,

1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:04.960
 they have this low side, this CRISPR low side that basically stands for clustered repeats,

1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:10.800
 interspersed, et cetera. So basically it's an interspersed repeats structure where basically

1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:16.560
 you have a set of repetitive regions and then interspersed where these variable segments

1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:22.320
 that were basically matching viruses. So when this was first discovered, it was basically

1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:27.280
 hypothesized that this is probably a bacterial immune system that remembers the trophies of

1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:33.360
 the viruses that manage the kill. And then the bacteria pass on, you know, they sort of do lateral

1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:38.240
 transfer of DNA and they pass on these memories so that the next bacterium says, oh, you killed

1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:43.200
 that guy, when that guy shows up again, I will recognize him. And the CRISPR system was basically

1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:51.040
 evolved as a bacterial adaptive immune response to sense foreigners that should not belong and to

1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:58.800
 just go and cut their genome. So it's an RNA guided RNA cutting enzyme or an RNA guided DNA

1:29:58.800 --> 1:30:04.080
 cutting enzyme. So there's different systems, some of them cut DNA, some of them cut RNA,

1:30:04.080 --> 1:30:13.200
 but all of them remember this sort of viral attack. So what we have done now as a field is,

1:30:13.200 --> 1:30:18.640
 you know, through the work of, you know, Jennifer Donner, Emmanuel Carpentier, Fang Zhang and many

1:30:18.640 --> 1:30:26.880
 others is coopted that system of bacterial immune defense as a way to cut genomes. You basically

1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:36.400
 have this guiding system that allows you to use an RNA guide to bring enzymes to cut DNA at a

1:30:36.400 --> 1:30:43.040
 particular locus. That's so fascinating. So this is like already a natural mechanism, a natural tool

1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:48.800
 for cutting those useful in this particular context. And we're like, well, we can use that

1:30:48.800 --> 1:30:53.440
 thing to actually, it's a nice tool that's already in the body. Yeah, yeah, it's not in our body,

1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:59.760
 it's in the bacterial body. It was discovered by the, by the yogurt industry. They were trying to

1:30:59.760 --> 1:31:04.480
 make better yogurts and they were trying to make their bacteria in their yogurt cultures

1:31:05.200 --> 1:31:10.880
 more resilient to viruses. And they were studying bacteria and they found that, wow,

1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:15.840
 this CRISPR system is awesome. It allows you to defend against that. And then it was coopted in

1:31:15.840 --> 1:31:21.760
 mammalian systems that don't use anything like that as a, as a, as a targeting way to basically

1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:27.360
 bring these DNA cutting enzymes to any locus in the genome. Why would you want to cut DNA

1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:34.640
 to do anything? The reason is that our DNA has a DNA repair mechanism where if a region of the

1:31:34.640 --> 1:31:39.120
 genome gets randomly cut, you will basically scan the genome for anything that matches

1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:46.160
 and sort of use it by homology. So the reason why we're deployed is because we now have a spare

1:31:46.160 --> 1:31:51.040
 copy. As soon as my mom's copy is deactivated, I can use my dad's copy. And somewhere else,

1:31:51.040 --> 1:31:56.640
 if my dad's copy is deactivated, I can use my mom's copy to repair it. So this is called homologous

1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:03.840
 based repair. So all you have to do is the cutting and you don't have to do the fixing.

1:32:03.840 --> 1:32:07.120
 That's exactly right. You don't have to do the fixing because it's already built in.

1:32:07.120 --> 1:32:12.640
 That's exactly right. But the fixing can be coopted by throwing in a bunch of homologous

1:32:13.280 --> 1:32:18.480
 segments that instead of having your dad's version, have whatever other version you'd like to use.

1:32:19.760 --> 1:32:23.840
 So the, so you, you then control the fixing by throwing in a bunch of other stuff.

1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:27.600
 That's exactly right. And that's how you do genome editing. So that's what CRISPR is.

1:32:27.600 --> 1:32:32.400
 That's what in popular culture, people use the term. I've never, wow, that's brilliant.

1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:39.360
 So CRISPR is genome vandalism followed by a bunch of band aids that have the sequence that you'd

1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:44.480
 like. And you can control the, the choices of band aids. Correct. And of course, there's new

1:32:44.480 --> 1:32:49.840
 generations of CRISPR. There's something that's called prime editing that was sort of very,

1:32:49.840 --> 1:32:54.480
 very much in the press recently, that basically instead of sort of making a double stranded break,

1:32:54.480 --> 1:33:00.640
 which again is genome vandalism, you basically make a single stranded break.

1:33:00.640 --> 1:33:06.560
 You basically just nick one of the two strands, enabling you to sort of peel off without sort

1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:13.600
 of completely breaking it up and then repair it locally using a guide that is coupled to your

1:33:14.640 --> 1:33:22.400
 initial RNA that took you to that location. Dumb question, but is CRISPR as awesome and

1:33:22.400 --> 1:33:30.960
 cool as it sounds? I mean, technically speaking, in terms of like, as a tool for manipulating our

1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:37.920
 genetics in the positive meaning of the word manipulating, or is there downsides,

1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:41.920
 drawbacks in this whole context of therapeutics that we're talking about or understanding and

1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:48.960
 so on. So, when I teach my students about CRISPR, I show them articles with the headline

1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:54.480
 genome editing tool revolutionizes biology. And then I show them the date of these tools,

1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:58.880
 of these articles, and they're 2004, like five years before CRISPR was invented.

1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:04.480
 And the reason is that they're not talking about CRISPR. They're talking about zinc finger enzymes

1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:11.280
 that are another way to bring these codders to the genome. It's a very difficult way of sort of

1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:16.480
 designing the right set of zinc finger proteins, the right set of amino acids that will now target

1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:22.000
 a particular long stretch of DNA. Because, you know, for every location that you want to target,

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:27.760
 you need to design a particular regulator, a particular protein that will match that region

1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:34.800
 well. There's another technology called tailings, which are basically, you know, just a different

1:34:34.800 --> 1:34:40.160
 way of using proteins to sort of, you know, guide these codders to a particular location of the

1:34:40.160 --> 1:34:46.800
 genome. These require a massive team of engineers, of biological engineers to basically design a set

1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:52.720
 of amino acids that will target a particular sequence of your genome. The reason why CRISPR is

1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:58.640
 amazingly, awesomely revolutionary is because instead of having this team of engineers

1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:03.120
 design a new set of proteins for every location that you want to target, you just type it in

1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:09.840
 your computer and you just synthesize an RNA guide. The beauty of CRISPR is not the cutting,

1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:15.680
 it's not the fixing. All of that was there before. It's the guiding, and the only thing that changes

1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:21.760
 that it makes the guiding easier by sort of, you know, just typing in the RNA sequence,

1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:25.680
 which then allows the system to sort of scan the DNA to find that.

1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:32.960
 So the coding, the engineering of the cutter is easier on the, in terms of, that's kind of similar

1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:38.720
 to the story of deep learning versus old school machine learning. Some of the challenging parts

1:35:38.720 --> 1:35:45.360
 are automated. Okay, so, but CRISPR is just one cutting technology. And then there's,

1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:51.280
 that's part of the challenges and exciting opportunities of the field is to design different

1:35:51.280 --> 1:35:55.760
 cutting technologies. Yeah. So now, we, you know, this was a big parenthesis on CRISPR.

1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:02.240
 But now you, you know, when we were talking about perturbations, you basically now have the ability

1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:07.280
 to not just look at correlation between enhancers and genes, but actually go and either

1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:13.280
 destroy that enhancer and see if the gene changes in expression, or you can use the CRISPR targeting

1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:22.240
 system to bring in not vandalism and cutting, but you can couple the CRISPR system with,

1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:28.160
 and the CRISPR system is called usually CRISPR Cas9, because Cas9 is the protein that will then come

1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:34.240
 and cut. But there's a version of that protein called dead Cas9, where the cutting part is

1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:42.240
 deactivated. So you basically use D Cas9, dead Cas9, to bring in an activator or to bring in a

1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:50.240
 repressor. So you can now ask, is this enhancer changing that gene by taking this modified CRISPR,

1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:55.200
 which is already modified from the bacteria to be used in humans, that you can now modify the Cas9,

1:36:55.200 --> 1:37:00.320
 to be dead Cas9, and you can now further modify to bring in a regulator. And you can basically

1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:06.320
 turn on or turn off that enhancer and then see what is the impact on that gene. So these are the four

1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:13.840
 ways of linking the locus to the target gene. And that's step number five. Okay, step number five

1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:19.040
 is find the target gene. And step number six is what the heck does that gene do? You basically now

1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:27.760
 go and manipulate that gene to basically see what are the processes that change. And you can

1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:33.520
 basically ask, well, you know, in this particular case, in the FTO locus, we found mesenchymal stem

1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:41.280
 cells that are the progenitors of white fat and brown fat, or beige fat. We found the RS1421085

1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:49.200
 nucleotide variant as the causal variant. We found this large enhancer, this master regulator,

1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:55.520
 I like to call it OB1 for obesity one, like the strongest enhancer associated with and OB1 was

1:37:55.520 --> 1:38:02.000
 kind of chubby as the actor. I don't know if you remember him. So you basically are using this

1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:10.400
 Jedi mind trick to basically find out the location of the genome that is responsible, the enhancer

1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:17.200
 that harbors it, the motif, the upstream regulator, which is arid 5B for AT rich interacting domain

1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:22.000
 5B, that's a protein that sort of comes and binds normally. That protein is normally a

1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:27.840
 repressor. It represses this super enhancer, this massive 12,000 nucleotide master regulatory

1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:34.960
 control region. And it turns off IRX3, which is a gene that's 600,000 nucleotides away,

1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:40.480
 and IRX5, which is 1.2 million nucleotides away. So those and what's the effect of turning them off?

1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:44.560
 That's exactly the next question. So step six is what do these genes actually do?

1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:50.960
 So we then ask, what does RX3 and RX5 do? The first thing we did is look across individuals

1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:55.520
 for individuals that had higher expression of RX3 or lower expression of RX3. And then

1:38:55.520 --> 1:38:59.680
 we looked at the expression of all of the other genes in the genome. And we looked for simply

1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:07.520
 correlation. And we found that IRX3 and RX5 were both correlated positively with lipid metabolism

1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:15.200
 and negatively with mitochondrial biogenesis. You're like, what the heck does that mean?

1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:22.720
 It doesn't sound related to obesity. Not at all, superficially. But lipid metabolism should,

1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:31.120
 because lipids is these high energy molecules that basically store fat. So IRX3 and RX5 are

1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:35.280
 negatively correlated with lipid metabolism. So that basically means that when they turn on

1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:41.360
 lipid metabolism, positively, when they turn on, they turn on lipid metabolism. And they're

1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:48.240
 negatively correlated with mitochondrial biogenesis. What do mitochondria do in this whole

1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:51.520
 process? Again, small parenthesis. What are mitochondria?

1:39:52.480 --> 1:40:00.160
 Mitochondria are little organelles. They arose. They only are found in eukaryotes.

1:40:00.880 --> 1:40:07.680
 U means good. Karyote means nucleus. So truly like a true nucleus. So eukaryotes have a nucleus.

1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:12.960
 Prokaryotes are before the nucleus. They don't have a nucleus. So eukaryotes have a nucleus.

1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:21.760
 Compartmentalization. Eukaryotes have also organelles. Some eukaryotes have chloroplasts.

1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:29.360
 These are the plants. They photosynthesize. Some other eukaryotes, like us, have another

1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:39.120
 type of organelle called mitochondria. These arose from an ancient species that we engulfed.

1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:48.080
 This is an endosymbiosis event. Symbiosis, bio means life. Sim means together. So symbiotes

1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:53.120
 are things that live together. Endosymbiosis, endo means inside. So endosymbiosis means you live

1:40:53.120 --> 1:41:02.800
 together, holding the other one inside you. So the pre eukaryotes engulfed an organism that

1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:10.240
 was very good at energy production. And that organism eventually shed most of its genome

1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:19.120
 to now have only 13 genes in the mitochondrial genome. And those 13 genes are all involved in

1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:25.760
 energy production, the electron transport chain. So basically, electrons are these massive super

1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:33.680
 energy rich molecules. We basically have these organelles that produce energy. And when your

1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:39.440
 muscle exercises, you basically multiply your mitochondria. You basically sort of, you know,

1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:45.040
 use more and more mitochondria. And that's how you get beefed up. So basically, the muscle sort

1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:50.240
 of learns how to generate more energy. So basically, every single time your muscles will, you know,

1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:53.840
 overnight regenerate and sort of become stronger and amplify their mitochondria and so on and so

1:41:53.840 --> 1:42:02.160
 forth. So what do mitochondria do? The mitochondria use energy to sort of do any kind of task. When

1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:07.520
 you're thinking, you're using energy. This energy comes from mitochondria. Your neurons have

1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:12.000
 mitochondria all over the place. Basically, this mitochondria can multiply as organelles

1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:16.160
 and they can be spread along the body of your muscle. Some of your muscle cells have actually

1:42:16.160 --> 1:42:20.800
 multiple nuclei, they're polynucleated, but they also have multiple mitochondria to basically

1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:26.000
 deal with the fact that your muscle is enormous. You can sort of span these super, super long

1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:29.760
 length. And you need energy throughout the length of your muscle. So that's why you have

1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:32.800
 mitochondria throughout the length. And you also need transcription through the length. So you

1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:41.840
 have multiple nuclei as well. So these two processes, lipids, store energy, what do mitochondria do?

1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:48.560
 So there's a process known as thermogenesis, thermo heat, genesis generation, thermogenesis

1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:56.080
 generation of heat. Remember that bathtub with the in and out? That's the equation that everybody's

1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:02.000
 focused on. So how much energy do you consume? How much energy do you burn? But in every thermodynamic

1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:09.840
 system, there's three parts to the equation. There's energy in, energy out, and energy lost.

1:43:09.840 --> 1:43:18.640
 Any machine has loss of energy. How do you lose energy? You emanate heat. So heat is energy loss.

1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:30.000
 Which is where the thermogenesis comes in. Thermogenesis is actually a regulatory process

1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:34.560
 that modulates the third component of the thermodynamic equation. You can basically

1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:39.120
 control thermogenesis explicitly. You can turn on and turn off thermogenesis.

1:43:39.120 --> 1:43:44.400
 And that's when the mitochondria comes into play. Exactly. So IRIX 3 and RX 5 turn out to be the

1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:52.640
 master regulators of a process of thermogenesis versus lipogenesis generation of fat. So IRIX

1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:59.600
 3 and RX 5 in most people burn heat, burn calories as heat. So when you eat too much,

1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:06.000
 just burn it off in your fat cells. So with that bathtub has basically a sort of dissipation

1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:14.480
 knob that most people are able to turn on. I am unable to turn that on because I am a

1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:23.120
 homozygous carrier for the mutation that changes a T into a C in the RS 1 4 2 1 0 8 5 allele,

1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:29.040
 a locus, a SNP. I have the risk allele twice from my mom and from my dad. So I'm unable to

1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:36.240
 thermogenize. I'm unable to turn on thermogenesis through IRIX 3 and RX 5 because the regulator

1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:42.400
 that normally binds here, IRIX 5B, can no longer bind because it's an AT rich interacting domain.

1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:46.800
 And as soon as I change the T into a C, it can no longer bind because it's no longer AT rich.

1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:50.720
 But doesn't that mean that you're able to use the energy more efficiently?

1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:56.800
 You're not generating heat or is that... That means I can eat less and get around just fine.

1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:01.840
 Yes. So that's a feature actually. It's a feature in a food scarce environment.

1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:06.960
 If we're all starving, I'm doing great. If we all have access to massive amounts of food,

1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:11.280
 I'm obese basically. That's taken us through the entire process of then

1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:18.240
 understanding that why mitochondria and then the lipids are both even though distant or somehow

1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:22.800
 involved. Different sides of the same coin. You basically choose to store energy or you can choose

1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:28.160
 to burn energy. And that all of that is involved in the puzzle of obesity. And that's what's

1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:34.480
 fascinating. Here we are in 2007 discovering the strongest genetic association with obesity

1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:40.880
 and knowing nothing about how it works for almost 10 years. For 10 years, everybody focused on this

1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:48.240
 FTO gene and they were like, oh, it must have to do something with RNA modification. And it's like,

1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:52.960
 no, it has nothing to do with the function of FTO. It has everything to do with all of this other

1:45:52.960 --> 1:45:58.240
 process. And suddenly the moment you solve that puzzle, which is a multi year effort by the way,

1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:03.440
 a tremendous effort by Melina and many, many others. So this tremendous effort basically

1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:10.800
 led us to recognize this circuitry. You went from having some 89 common variants associated in

1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:17.920
 that region of the DNA sitting on top of this gene to knowing the whole circuitry. When you

1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:24.560
 know the circuitry, you can now go crazy. You can now start intervening at every level. You can

1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:29.760
 start intervening at the arid 5B level. You can start intervening with CRISPR cast 9 at the single

1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:35.680
 SNP level. You can start intervening at IRX3 and RX5 directly there. You can start intervening at

1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:39.920
 the thermogenesis level because you know the pathway. You can start intervening at the

1:46:39.920 --> 1:46:47.200
 differentiation level where the decision to make either white fat or beige fat, the energy burning

1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:53.760
 beige fat is made developmentally in the first three days of differentiation of your adipocytes.

1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:57.920
 So as they're differentiating, you basically can choose to make fat burning machines or fat

1:46:57.920 --> 1:47:03.680
 storing machines. And sort of that's how you populate your fat. You basically can now go in

1:47:03.680 --> 1:47:09.840
 pharmaceutical and do all of that. And in our paper, we actually did all of that. We went in and

1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:16.080
 manipulated every single aspect. At the nucleotide level, we use CRISPR cast 9 genome editing to

1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:22.320
 basically take primary adipocytes from risk and non risk individuals and show that by editing

1:47:22.320 --> 1:47:28.640
 that one nucleotide out of 3.2 billion nucleotides in the human genome, you could then flip between

1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:32.080
 an obese phenotype and a lean phenotype like a switch. You can basically take

1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:36.880
 micelles that are non thermogenizing and just flip into thermogenizing cells by changing one

1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:43.120
 nucleotide. It's mind boggling. It's so inspiring that this puzzle could be solved in this way and

1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:49.600
 it feels within reach to then be able to crack the problem of some of these diseases.

1:47:50.240 --> 1:48:01.200
 What are the technologies, the tools that came along that made this possible? What are you excited

1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:07.200
 about maybe if we just look at the buffet of things that you've kind of mentioned? What's

1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:12.480
 involved? What should we be excited about? What are you excited about? I love that question because

1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:23.520
 there's so much ahead of us. So basically solving that one locus required massive amounts of knowledge

1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:27.760
 that we have been building across the years through the epigenome, through the comparative

1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:33.520
 genomics to find out the causal variant and the controller regulatory motif through the

1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:40.000
 conserved circuitry. It required knowing these regulatory genomic wiring. It required high C

1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:44.400
 of the sort of topologically associated domains to basically find this long range interaction.

1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:50.960
 It required EQTLs of this sort of genetic perturbation of these intermediate gene phenotypes.

1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:56.000
 It required all of the arsenal of tools that I've been describing was put together for one

1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:04.320
 locus and this was a massive team effort, huge investment in time, energy, money, effort,

1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:10.800
 intellectual, you know, everything. You're referring to, I'm sorry, this one paper? Yeah, this one

1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:15.440
 single paper. This one single locus. I like to say that this is a paper about one nucleotide

1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:21.040
 in the human genome, about one bit of information, C versus T in the human genome. That's one bit of

1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:27.200
 information and we have 3.2 billion nucleotides to go through. So how do you do that systematically?

1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:35.200
 I am so excited about the next phase of research because the technologies that my group and many

1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:41.440
 other groups have developed allows us to now do this systematically, not just one locus at a time,

1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:46.720
 but thousands of loci at a time. So let me describe some of these technologies.

1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:55.200
 The first one is automation and robotics. So basically, you know, we talked about how you

1:49:55.200 --> 1:50:00.240
 can take all of these molecules and see which of these molecules are targeting each of these

1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:05.360
 genes and what do they do. So you can basically now screen through millions of molecules,

1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:10.720
 through thousands and thousands and thousands of plates, each of which has thousands and thousands

1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:19.760
 and thousands of molecules, every single time testing, you know, all of these genes and asking

1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:24.080
 which of these molecules perturb these genes. So that's technology number one, automation and

1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:30.880
 robotics. Technology number two is parallel readouts. So instead of perturbing one locus

1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:38.400
 and then asking if I use CRISPR Cas9 on this enhancer to basically use D Cas9 to turn on or

1:50:38.400 --> 1:50:44.640
 turn off the enhancer, or if I use CRISPR Cas9 on the SNP to basically change that one SNP at a time,

1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:52.160
 then what happened? But we have 120,000 disease associated SNPs that we want to test.

1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:59.840
 We don't want to spend 120,000 years doing it. So what do we do? We've basically developed this

1:50:59.840 --> 1:51:08.160
 technology for massively parallel reporter assays, MPRA. So in collaboration with Tarzan

1:51:08.160 --> 1:51:13.120
 Mickelson, Eric Lander, I mean, Jason Durie's group has done a lot of that. So there's a lot of

1:51:13.120 --> 1:51:20.320
 groups that basically have developed technologies for testing 10,000 genetic variants at a time.

1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:26.560
 Okay. How do you do that? You know, we talked about microarray technology, the ability to

1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:31.360
 synthesize these huge microarrays that allow you to do all kinds of things like measure gene

1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:37.360
 expression by hybridization, by measuring the genotype of a person, by looking at hybridization

1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:42.960
 with one version with a T versus the other version with a C, and then sort of figuring out that I

1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:48.480
 am a risk carrier for obesity based on these hybridization, differential hybridization in my

1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:52.080
 genome that says, oh, you seem to only have this allele, or you seem to have that allele.

1:51:52.720 --> 1:52:00.320
 Microarrays can also be used to systematically synthesize small fragments of DNA. So you can

1:52:00.320 --> 1:52:08.160
 basically synthesize these 150 nucleotide long fragments across 450,000 spots at a time.

1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:16.000
 You can now take the result of that synthesis, which basically works through all of these sort

1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:20.480
 of layers of adding one nucleotide at a time. You can basically just type it into your computer

1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:30.480
 and order it. And you can basically order 10,000 or 100,000 of these small DNA segments at a time.

1:52:30.480 --> 1:52:35.200
 And that's where awesome molecular biology comes in. You can basically take all these segments,

1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:41.840
 have a common start and end barcode or sort of ligator, like just like pieces of a puzzle.

1:52:41.840 --> 1:52:48.640
 You can make the same end piece and the same start piece for all of them. And you can now

1:52:48.640 --> 1:52:56.240
 use plasmids, which are these extra chromosomal small DNA circular segments

1:52:57.680 --> 1:53:01.600
 that are basically inhabiting all our all our genomes. We basically have, you know,

1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:07.360
 plasmids floating around. Bacteria use plasmids for transferring DNA. And that's where they

1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:13.280
 put a lot of antibiotic resistance genes. So they can easily transfer them from one bacterium to the

1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:20.000
 other. So one bacterium evolves a gene to be resistant to a particular antibiotic. It basically

1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:26.480
 says to all its friends, Hey, here's that sort of DNA piece, we can now coopt these plasmids

1:53:26.480 --> 1:53:32.880
 into human cells. We can basically make a human cell culture and add plasmids to that human cell

1:53:32.880 --> 1:53:40.320
 culture that contain the things that you want to test. You now have this library of 450,000

1:53:40.320 --> 1:53:47.440
 elements. You can insert them each into the common plasmid and then test them in millions of cells

1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:51.840
 in parallel. And the common plasmid is all the same before you add it. Exactly. The rest of the

1:53:51.840 --> 1:53:59.120
 plasmid is the same. So it's called an epizomal reporter assay. Epizome means not inside the

1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:04.400
 genome, it's sort of outside the chromosomes. So it's an epizomal assay that allows you to have

1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:10.560
 a variable region where you basically test 10,000 different enhancers. And you have a common region

1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:16.320
 which basically has the same reporter gene. You now can do some very cool molecular biology.

1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:22.000
 You can basically take the 450,000 elements that you've generated. And you have a piece of the

1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:26.160
 puzzle here, piece of the puzzle here, which is identical. So they're compatible with that plasmid.

1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:32.160
 You can chop them up in the middle to separate a barcode reporter from the enhancer and in the

1:54:32.160 --> 1:54:38.160
 middle put the same gene again using the same piece of the puzzle. You now can have a barcode

1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:44.720
 readout of what is the impact of 10,000 different versions of an enhancer on gene expression.

1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:51.360
 So we're not doing one experiment, we're doing 10,000 experiments. And those 10,000 can be

1:54:51.360 --> 1:55:00.240
 5,000 of different loci and each of them in two versions, risk or non risk. I can now test 10s

1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:04.880
 of thousands. These are little hypotheses. Exactly. And then you can do 10,000 and wait.

1:55:04.880 --> 1:55:10.320
 You can test 10,000 hypotheses at once. How hard is it to generate those 10,000?

1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:16.080
 Trivial, trivial. But it's biology. No, no, generating the 10,000 is trivial because you

1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:22.960
 basically add, it's biotechnology. You basically have these arrays that add one nucleotide at a

1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:30.960
 time at every spot. And yet, so it's printing in it. So you're able to control. Super costly.

1:55:30.960 --> 1:55:36.960
 10,000 bucks. So this isn't millions? 10,000 bucks for 10,000 experiments. Sounds like the right,

1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:42.000
 you know. So that's super, that's exciting because you don't have to do one thing at a time.

1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:47.920
 You can now use that technology, these massively parallel reporter assays to test 10,000 locations

1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:56.400
 at a time. We've made multiple modifications to that technology. One was sharper MPRA, which stands

1:55:56.400 --> 1:56:09.040
 for, you know, basically getting a higher resolution view by tiling these elements. So you can see

1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:16.400
 where along the region of control are they acting. And we made another modification called Hydra

1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:24.240
 for high, you know, definition regulatory annotation or something like that, which basically

1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:30.720
 allows you to test 7 million of these at a time by sort of cutting them directly from the DNA.

1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:36.240
 So instead of synthesizing, which basically has the limit of 450,000 that you can synthesize at a

1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:41.680
 time, basically said, hey, if we want to test all accessible regions of the genome, let's just do an

1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:47.440
 experiment that cuts accessible regions. Let's take those accessible regions, put them all with the

1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:57.200
 same end joints of the puzzles, and then now use those to create a much, much larger array of things

1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:01.440
 that you can test. And then tiling all of these regions, you can then pinpoint what are the driver

1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:07.360
 nucleotides, what are the elements, how are they acting across 7 million experiments at a time.

1:57:07.360 --> 1:57:12.560
 So basically, this is all the same family of technology, where you're basically using these

1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:19.600
 parallel readouts of the barcodes. And then, you know, to do this, we used a technology called

1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:26.160
 Starseq for self transcribing reporter assets, a technology developed by Alex Stark, my

1:57:26.160 --> 1:57:33.040
 former postdoc, who's now a PI over in Vienna. So we basically coupled the Starseq, the self

1:57:33.040 --> 1:57:39.920
 transcribing reporters, where the enhancer can be part of the gene itself. So instead of having a

1:57:39.920 --> 1:57:45.520
 separate barcode, that enhancer basically acts to turn on the gene, and he's transcribed as part of

1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:48.880
 the gene. You don't have to have the two separate parts. Exactly. So you can just read them directly.

1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:54.640
 So there's a constant improvements in this whole process. By the way, generating all these options

1:57:54.640 --> 1:58:00.320
 is a basically brute force. How much human intuition is? Oh, gosh, of course, it's human

1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:06.240
 intuition and human creativity and incorporating all of the input data sets. Because again,

1:58:06.240 --> 1:58:11.840
 the genome is enormous, 3.2 billion, you don't want to test that. Instead, you basically use all

1:58:11.840 --> 1:58:17.440
 of these tools that I've talked about already, you generate your top favorite 10,000 hypothesis,

1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:22.480
 and then you go and test all 10,000. And then from what comes out, you can then go to the next step.

1:58:22.480 --> 1:58:28.880
 So that's technology number two. So technology number one is robotics, automation, where you

1:58:28.880 --> 1:58:33.760
 have thousands of wells, and you constantly test them. The second technology is instead

1:58:33.760 --> 1:58:39.200
 of having wells, you have these massively parallel readouts in sort of these pooled asses.

1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:50.240
 The third technology is coupling CRISPR perturbations with these single cell RNA readouts.

1:58:50.240 --> 1:58:55.680
 So let me make another parenthesis here to describe now single cell RNA sequencing.

1:58:56.720 --> 1:59:04.240
 So what does single cell RNA sequencing mean? So RNA sequencing is what has been traditionally used,

1:59:04.240 --> 1:59:09.200
 well, traditionally the last 20 years, ever since the advent of next generation sequencing.

1:59:09.200 --> 1:59:14.560
 So basically before RNA expression profiling was based on this microarrays. The next technology

1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:21.280
 after that was based on sequencing. So you chop up your RNA and you just sequence small molecules,

1:59:21.280 --> 1:59:26.880
 just like you would sequence a genome, basically reverse transcribe the small RNAs into DNA,

1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:34.080
 and you sequence that DNA in order to get the number of sequencing reads corresponding to

1:59:34.080 --> 1:59:40.160
 the expression level of every gene in the genome. You now have RNA sequencing. How do you go to

1:59:40.160 --> 1:59:46.640
 single cell RNA sequencing? That technology also went through stages of evolution. The first was

1:59:46.640 --> 1:59:52.880
 microfluidics. You basically had these, or even chambers, you basically had these ways of isolating

1:59:52.880 --> 1:59:58.560
 individual cells, putting them into a well for every one of these cells. So you have 384 well

1:59:58.560 --> 2:00:05.840
 plates, and you now do 384 parallel reactions to measure the expression of 384 cells. That sounds

2:00:05.840 --> 2:00:13.280
 amazing, and it was amazing. But we want to do a million cells. How do you go from these wells

2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:19.440
 to a million cells? You can't. So what the next technology was after that is instead of using

2:00:19.440 --> 2:00:27.600
 a well for every reaction, you now use a lipid droplet for every reaction. So you use micro

2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:35.600
 droplets as reaction chambers to basically amplify RNA. So here's the idea. You basically have

2:00:35.600 --> 2:00:40.960
 microfluidics where you basically have every single cell coming down one tube in your microfluidics,

2:00:41.520 --> 2:00:44.880
 and you have little bubbles getting created in the other way with

2:00:44.880 --> 2:00:50.560
 specific primers that mark every cell with its own barcode. You basically couple the two,

2:00:50.560 --> 2:00:56.320
 and you end up with little bubbles that have a cell and tons of markers for that cell.

2:00:57.120 --> 2:01:01.440
 You now mark up all of the RNA for that one cell with the same exact barcode,

2:01:01.440 --> 2:01:07.520
 and you then lyse all of the droplets, and you sequence the heck out of that,

2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:12.640
 and you have for every RNA molecule a unique identifier that tells you what cell was it on.

2:01:12.640 --> 2:01:20.880
 That is such good engineering, microfluidics, and using some kind of primer to put a label

2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:26.800
 on the thing. I mean, you're making it sound easy. I assume it's beautiful, but it's gorgeous.

2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:32.320
 So there's the next generation. So that's the second generation. Next generation is forget

2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:36.880
 the microfluidics all together. Just use big bottles. How can you possibly do that with big

2:01:36.880 --> 2:01:42.560
 bottles? So here's the idea. You dissociate all of your cells or all of your nuclei from

2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:48.400
 complex cells like brain cells that are very long and sticky, so you can't do that. So if you have

2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:53.200
 blood cells or if you have neuronal nuclei or brain nuclei, you can basically dissociate,

2:01:53.200 --> 2:02:01.360
 let's say, a million cells. You now want to add a unique barcode in each one of a million cells

2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:05.760
 using only big bottles. How can you possibly do that? Sounds crazy, but here's the idea.

2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:12.720
 You use a hundred of these bottles. You randomly shuffle all your million cells,

2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:18.080
 and you throw them into those hundred bottles randomly, completely random. You add one barcode

2:02:18.080 --> 2:02:23.920
 out of a hundred to every one of the cells. You then you now take them all out, you shuffle them

2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:30.400
 again, and you throw them again into the same hundred bottles, but now in a different randomization,

2:02:31.440 --> 2:02:37.760
 and you add a second barcode. So every cell now has two barcodes. You take them out again,

2:02:37.760 --> 2:02:44.000
 you shuffle them, and you throw them back in. Another third barcode is adding randomly from

2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:52.560
 the same hundred barcodes. You've now labeled every cell probabilistically based on the unique

2:02:52.560 --> 2:02:56.160
 path that it took of which of a hundred bottles did it go for the first time, which of a hundred

2:02:56.160 --> 2:03:00.880
 bottles the second time, and which of a hundred bottles the third time. A hundred times a hundred

2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:08.880
 times a hundred is a million unique barcodes in every single one of these cells without ever using

2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:13.840
 microfluid. It's beautiful, right? From a computer science perspective, it's very clever. So you now

2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:18.560
 have the single cell sequencing technology. You can use the wells, you can use the bubbles,

2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:24.480
 or you can use the bottles. The bottles still sound pretty damn good. The bottles are awesome,

2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:28.080
 and that's basically the main technology that we're using. So the bottles is the main technology.

2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:33.680
 So there are kids now that companies just sell to basically carry out single cell

2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:40.240
 RNA sequencing that you can basically, for $2,000, you can basically get 10,000 cells from one sample.

2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:47.760
 And for every one of those cells, you basically have the transcription of thousands of genes.

2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:54.960
 And of course, the data for any one cell is noisy, but being computer scientists, we can aggregate

2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:59.680
 the data from all of the cells together across thousands of individuals together to basically

2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:06.720
 make very robust inferences. So the third technology is basically single cell RNA sequencing that allows

2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:14.080
 you to now start asking not just what is the brain expression level difference of that genetic variant,

2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:19.840
 but what is the expression difference of that one genetic variant across every single subtype

2:04:19.840 --> 2:04:27.040
 of brain cell? How is the variance changing? You can't just, you know, with a brain sample,

2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:34.000
 you can just ask about the mean, what is the average expression? If I instead have 3,000 cells

2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:39.600
 that are neurons, I can ask not just what is the neuronal expression, I can say for

2:04:39.600 --> 2:04:45.360
 layer five excitatory neurons, of which I have, I don't know, 300 cells, what is the variance

2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:51.680
 that this genetic variant has? So suddenly, it's amazingly more powerful. I can basically start

2:04:51.680 --> 2:04:56.640
 asking about this middle layer of gene expression at unprecedented levels. And when you look at the

2:04:56.640 --> 2:05:03.680
 average, it washes out some potentially important signal that corresponds to ultimately the disease.

2:05:03.680 --> 2:05:09.840
 Completely. Yeah. So that I can do that at the RNA level, but I can also do that at the DNA level

2:05:09.840 --> 2:05:13.920
 for the epigenome. So remember how before I was telling you about all these technologies that

2:05:13.920 --> 2:05:19.040
 we're using to probe the epigenome, one of them is DNA accessibility. So what we're doing in my lab

2:05:19.040 --> 2:05:24.880
 is that from the same dissociation of say a brain sample, where you now have all these tens of thousands

2:05:24.880 --> 2:05:30.640
 of cells floating around, you basically take half of them to do RNA profiling. And the other have to

2:05:30.640 --> 2:05:35.680
 do epigenome profiling, both at the single cell level. So that allows you to now figure out what

2:05:35.680 --> 2:05:43.440
 are the millions of DNA enhancers that are accessible in every one of tens of thousands of cells.

2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:50.480
 And computationally, we can now take the RNA and the DNA readouts and group them together

2:05:50.480 --> 2:05:58.160
 to basically figure out how is every enhancer related to every gene. And remember these sort

2:05:58.160 --> 2:06:04.960
 of enhancer gene linking that we were doing across 833 samples. 833 is awesome. Don't get me wrong.

2:06:04.960 --> 2:06:11.760
 But 10 million is way more awesome. So we can now look at correlated activity across 2.3 million

2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:18.160
 enhancers and 20,000 genes in each of millions of cells to basically start piecing together the

2:06:18.160 --> 2:06:24.800
 regulatory circuitry of every single type of neuron, every single type of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes,

2:06:24.800 --> 2:06:32.320
 microglial cell, inside the brains of 1,500 individuals that we've sampled across multiple

2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:38.800
 different brain regions across both DNA and RNA. So that's the data set that my team generated last

2:06:38.800 --> 2:06:45.920
 year alone. So in one year, we've basically generated 10 million cells from human brain across

2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:50.880
 a dozen different disorders across ketophenia, Alzheimer's, frontal temporal dementia,

2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:59.120
 Lewy body dementia, ALS, you know, Huntington's disease, post traumatic stress disorder, autism,

2:06:59.120 --> 2:07:06.720
 like, you know, bipolar disorder, healthy aging, etc. So it's possible that even just within that

2:07:06.720 --> 2:07:16.960
 data set lie a lot of keys to understanding these diseases and then be able to, like, directly leads

2:07:16.960 --> 2:07:23.120
 to then treatment. Correct. Correct. So basically, we are now motivating. Yeah. So our computational

2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:27.440
 team is in heaven right now. And we're looking for people. I mean, if you have listeners who are

2:07:27.440 --> 2:07:34.480
 super smart. So this is a very interesting kind of side question. How much of this is biology?

2:07:34.480 --> 2:07:39.920
 How much of this is computation? So you had the computational biology group, but how much of

2:07:41.920 --> 2:07:47.600
 I should, should you be comfortable with biology to be able to solve some of these problems?

2:07:48.400 --> 2:07:52.000
 If you just find if you put several of the hassle you were on,

2:07:52.800 --> 2:07:55.680
 fundamentally, are you thinking like a computer scientist here?

2:07:56.240 --> 2:08:02.160
 You have to. This is the only way. As I said, we are the descendants of the first digital

2:08:02.160 --> 2:08:05.520
 computer. We're trying to understand the digital computer, understand, we're trying to understand

2:08:05.520 --> 2:08:12.640
 the circuitry, the logic of this digital, you know, core computer and all of these analog layers

2:08:12.640 --> 2:08:18.720
 surrounding it. So you, you know, the case that I've been making is that you cannot think one gene

2:08:18.720 --> 2:08:23.760
 at a time. The traditional biology is dead. There's no way you cannot solve disease with

2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:29.840
 traditional biology. You need it as a component. Once you figured out RX3 and RX5, you now can

2:08:29.840 --> 2:08:34.320
 then say, Hey, have you guys worked on those genes with your single gene approach? We'd love to know

2:08:34.320 --> 2:08:39.600
 everything you know. And if you haven't, we now know how important these genes are. Let's now launch

2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:46.160
 a single gene program to dissect them and understand them. But you cannot use that as a way to dissect

2:08:46.160 --> 2:08:50.560
 disease. You have to think genomically. You have to think from the global perspective,

2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:55.920
 and you have to build these circuits systematically. So we need numbers of computer

2:08:55.920 --> 2:09:02.880
 scientists who are interested and willing to dive into this data, you know, fully, fully in and sort

2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:09.200
 of extract meaning. We need computer science people who can understand sort of machine learning and

2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:14.400
 inference and sort of, you know, decouple these matrices, come up with super smart ways of sort

2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:20.160
 of dissecting them. But we also need by all computer scientists who understand biology,

2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:26.240
 who are able to design the next generation of experiments. Because many of these experiments,

2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:30.000
 no one in the right mind would design them without thinking of the analytical approach

2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:33.920
 that you would use to deconvolve the data afterwards. Because it's massive amounts of

2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:40.960
 ridiculously noisy data. And if you don't have the computational pipeline in your head before you

2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:45.760
 even design the experiment, you would never design the experiment that way. That's brilliant. So you

2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:49.920
 in designing the experiment, you have to see the entirety of the computational pipeline.

2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:56.640
 That drives the design. That even drives the necessity for that design. Basically, you know,

2:09:56.640 --> 2:10:02.400
 if you didn't have a computer scientist way of thinking, you would never design these hugely

2:10:02.400 --> 2:10:08.960
 combinatorial, massively parallel experiments. So that's why you need interdisciplinary teams.

2:10:08.960 --> 2:10:14.080
 You need teams. And I want to sort of clarify that what do we mean by computational biology group?

2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:21.040
 The focus is not on computational, the focus is on biology. So we are a biology group. What type

2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:27.760
 of biology? Computational biology. That's the type of biology that uses the whole genome. That's the

2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:33.120
 type of biology that designs experiments, genomic experiments that can only be interpreted in the

2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:38.960
 context of the whole genome. Right. So it's philosophically looking at biology as a computer.

2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:46.480
 Correct. Correct. So which is in the context of the history of biology is a big transformation.

2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:52.080
 Yeah. Yeah. You can think of the name as what do we do? Only computation. That's not true. But

2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:58.400
 how do we study it? Only computationally, that is true. So all of these single cell sequencing

2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:01.920
 can now be coupled with the technology that we talked about earlier for perturbation.

2:11:02.720 --> 2:11:08.720
 So here's a crazy thing. Instead of using these wells and these robotic systems for doing

2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:16.080
 one drug at a time or for perturbing one gene at a time in thousands of wells, you can now do this

2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:22.720
 using a pool of cells and single cell RNA sequencing. How? You basically can take these

2:11:23.360 --> 2:11:30.320
 perturbations using CRISPR and instead of using a single guide RNA, you can use a library of

2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:36.160
 guide RNAs generated exactly the same way using this array technology. So you synthesize a thousand

2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:44.480
 different guide RNAs. You now take each of these guide RNAs and you insert them in a pool of cells

2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:50.800
 where every cell gets one perturbation and you use CRISPR editing or CRISPR,

2:11:52.960 --> 2:11:58.960
 so with either CRISPR Cas9 to edit the genome with these thousand perturbations or with the

2:11:58.960 --> 2:12:05.440
 activation or with the repression and you now can have a single cell readout where every single cell

2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:13.600
 has received one of these modifications and you can now in massively parallel ways couple the

2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:20.080
 perturbation and the readout in a single experiment. How are you tracking which perturbations

2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:25.120
 with each cell received? So there's ways of doing that but basically one way is to make

2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:31.120
 that perturbation an expressible vector so that part of your RNA reading is actually

2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:36.880
 that perturbation itself. So you can basically put it in an expressible part so you can self

2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:42.560
 drive it. So the point that I want to get across is that the sky is the limit. You basically have

2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:48.400
 these tools, these building blocks of molecular biology, you have these massive data sets of

2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:54.800
 computational biology, you have this huge ability to sort of use machine learning and statistical

2:12:54.800 --> 2:13:00.320
 methods and you know linear algebra to sort of reduce the dimensionality of all these massive

2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:09.440
 data sets and then you end up with a series of actionable targets that you can then couple

2:13:09.440 --> 2:13:17.120
 with pharma and just go after systematically. So the ability to sort of bring genetics to the

2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:22.400
 epigenomics to the transcriptomics to the cellular readouts using these sort of high

2:13:22.400 --> 2:13:27.680
 throughput perturbation technologies that I'm talking about and ultimately to the organism

2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:35.280
 through the electronic health record endofenotypes and ultimately the disease battery of assays

2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:39.600
 at the cognitive level at the physiological level and you know every other level.

2:13:41.680 --> 2:13:46.800
 There is no better or more exciting field in my view to be a computer scientist then

2:13:46.800 --> 2:13:52.080
 or to be a scientist in period. Basically this confluence of technologies of computation,

2:13:52.080 --> 2:13:58.960
 of data, of insight and of tools for manipulation is unprecedented in human history and I think

2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:05.440
 this is what's shaping the next century to really be a transformative century for our species

2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:13.520
 and for our planet. So you think the 21st century will be remembered for the big

2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:21.360
 leaps in understanding and alleviation of biology? If you look at the path between discovery and

2:14:21.360 --> 2:14:27.520
 therapeutics it's been on the order of 50 years, it's been shortened to 40, 30, 20 and now it's on

2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:33.920
 the order of 10 years but the huge number of technologies that are going on right now for

2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:41.200
 discovery will result undoubtedly in the most dramatic manipulation of human biology that

2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:46.240
 we've ever seen in the history of humanity in the next few years. Do you think we might be able to

2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:53.040
 cure some of the diseases we started this conversation with? Absolutely. It's only a matter

2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:58.160
 of time. Basically the complexity is enormous and I don't want to underestimate the complexity

2:14:58.160 --> 2:15:03.760
 but the number of insights is unprecedented and the ability to manipulate is unprecedented

2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:10.720
 and the ability to deliver these small molecules and other non traditional medicine perturbations.

2:15:10.720 --> 2:15:17.680
 There's a lot of new generation of perturbations that you can use at the DNA level, at the RNA

2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:25.120
 level, at the microRNA level, at the epigenomic level. There's a battery of new generations of

2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:31.840
 perturbations. If you couple that with cell type identifiers that can basically sense when you are

2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:37.200
 in the right cell based on the specific combination and then turn on that intervention for that cell

2:15:37.200 --> 2:15:42.480
 you can now think of combinatorial interventions where you can basically sort of feed a synthetic

2:15:42.480 --> 2:15:47.600
 biology construct to someone that will basically do different things in different cells. So

2:15:47.600 --> 2:15:52.400
 basically for cancer this is one of the therapeutics that our collaborator Ron Weiss is using to

2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:56.960
 basically start sort of engineering the circuits that will use microRNA sensors of the environment

2:15:56.960 --> 2:16:00.560
 to sort of know if you're in a tumor cell or if you're in an immune cell or if you're in a

2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:07.360
 stromal cell and so forth and basically turn on particular interventions there. You can sort of create constructs

2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:14.720
 that are tuned to only the liver cells or only the heart cells or only the you know brain cells

2:16:14.720 --> 2:16:20.960
 and then have these new generations of therapeutics coupled with this immense amount of knowledge

2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:25.840
 on the sort of which targets to choose and what biological processes to measure

2:16:25.840 --> 2:16:33.040
 and how to intervene. My view is that disease is going to be fundamentally altered and alleviated

2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:39.600
 as we go forward. Next time we talk we'll talk about the philosophical implications

2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:44.560
 that and the effect of life but let's stick to biology for just a little longer. We did pretty

2:16:44.560 --> 2:16:52.480
 good today we're still stuck to the science. What are you excited in terms of the future of this

2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:59.920
 of this field the technologies in your own group in your mind you're leading the world at MIT in

2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:06.880
 the science and the engineering of this work so what are you excited about here? I could not be

2:17:06.880 --> 2:17:13.440
 more excited. We are one of many many teams who are working on this. In my team the most exciting

2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:19.520
 parts are you know many folds so basically we've now assembled these batteries of technologies

2:17:19.520 --> 2:17:27.040
 we've assembled these massive data sets and now we're really sort of in the stage of our team's

2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:35.200
 path of generating disease insights so we are simultaneously working on a paper on schizophrenia

2:17:35.200 --> 2:17:39.440
 right now that is basically using the single cell profiling technologies using this editing and

2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:46.800
 manipulation technologies to basically show how the master regulators underlying changes in the

2:17:46.800 --> 2:17:52.240
 brain that are sort of found in in schizophrenia are in fact affecting excitatory neurons and

2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:59.040
 inhibitory neurons in pathways that are active both in synaptic pruning but also in early development

2:17:59.040 --> 2:18:03.360
 we've basically found this set of four regulators that are connecting these two processes that were

2:18:03.360 --> 2:18:10.800
 previously separate in schizophrenia in sort of having a sort of more unified view across those

2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:16.640
 two those two sides the second one is in the in the area of metabolism we basically now have a beautiful

2:18:16.640 --> 2:18:25.360
 collaboration with a Goodyear lab that's basically looking at multi tissue perturbations in six or

2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:32.080
 seven different tissues across the body in the context of exercise and in the context of nutritional

2:18:32.080 --> 2:18:38.880
 interventions using both mouse and human where we can basically see what are the cell to cell

2:18:38.880 --> 2:18:44.880
 communications that are that are changing across them and what we're finding is this immense role

2:18:44.880 --> 2:18:51.280
 of both immune cells as well as adipocyte stem cells in sort of reshaping that circuitry of all

2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:55.920
 of these different tissues and that's sort of painting to a new path for therapeutic intervention

2:18:55.920 --> 2:19:02.080
 there in Alzheimer's it's this huge focus on microglia and now we're discovering different

2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:12.080
 classes of microglial cells that are basically either synaptic or immune and these are playing

2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:17.600
 vastly different roles in Alzheimer's versus in schizophrenia and what we're finding is this

2:19:17.600 --> 2:19:24.640
 immense complexity as you go further and further down of how in fact there's 10 different types

2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:29.840
 of microglia each with their own sort of expression programs we used to think of them as oh yeah they're

2:19:29.840 --> 2:19:36.080
 microglia but in fact now we're realizing just even in that sort of least abundant of cell types

2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:42.400
 there's this incredible diversity there the differences between brain regions is is another

2:19:42.400 --> 2:19:47.680
 sort of major major insight again you know one would think that oh astrocytes are astrocytes no

2:19:47.680 --> 2:19:53.280
 matter where they are but no there's incredible region specific differences in the expression

2:19:53.280 --> 2:19:58.000
 patterns of all of the major brain cell types across different brain regions so basically

2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:02.000
 there's the neocortical regions that are sort of the recent innovation that makes us so different

2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:07.120
 from all other species there's the sort of you know reptilian brain sort of regions that are sort of

2:20:07.120 --> 2:20:13.440
 much more uh you know very extremely distinct there's the cerebellum there's um each of those

2:20:13.440 --> 2:20:19.280
 basically is associated in a different way with disease and what we're doing now is looking into

2:20:19.280 --> 2:20:26.000
 pseudo temporal models for how disease progresses across different regions of the brain if you look

2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:30.720
 at Alzheimer's it basically starts in this small region called the entorhinal cortex and then it

2:20:30.720 --> 2:20:38.400
 spreads through the brain and you know through the hippocampus and you know the ultimately

2:20:38.400 --> 2:20:42.960
 affecting the neocortex and with every brain region that it hits it basically has a different

2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:51.280
 impact on the cognitive and you know memory aspects orientation short term memory long

2:20:51.280 --> 2:20:57.200
 term memory etc which is you know dramatically affecting the cognitive path that the individuals

2:20:57.200 --> 2:21:04.480
 go through so what we're doing now is uh creating these computational models for ordering the cells

2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:10.240
 and the regions and the individuals according to their ability to predict Alzheimer's disease

2:21:10.240 --> 2:21:17.680
 so we can have a cell level predictor of pathology that allows us to now create a temporal time

2:21:17.680 --> 2:21:23.200
 course that tells us when every gene turns on along this pathology progression and then trace

2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:28.480
 that across regions and pathological measures that are region specific but also cognitive

2:21:28.480 --> 2:21:33.920
 measures and so on and so forth so that allows us to now sort of for the first time look at can we

2:21:33.920 --> 2:21:39.040
 actually do early intervention for Alzheimer's where we know that the disease starts manifesting

2:21:39.040 --> 2:21:46.560
 for 10 years before you actually have your first cognitive loss can we start seeing that path to

2:21:46.560 --> 2:21:52.400
 build new diagnostics new prognostics new biomarkers for this sort of early intervention

2:21:52.400 --> 2:21:57.600
 in Alzheimer's the other aspect that we're looking at is mosaicism we talked about the

2:21:57.600 --> 2:22:03.760
 common variants and the rare variants but in addition to those rare variants as your initial cell

2:22:05.120 --> 2:22:10.000
 that that forms the zygote divides and divides and divides with every cell division there are

2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:16.160
 additional mutations that are happening so what you end up with is your brain being a mosaic

2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:21.840
 of multiple different types of genetic underpinnings some cells contain a mutation that other cells

2:22:21.840 --> 2:22:30.560
 don't have so every human has the common variants that all of us carry to some degree the rare

2:22:30.560 --> 2:22:36.800
 variants that your immediate tree of the human species carries and then there's the somatic

2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:44.240
 variants which is the tree that happened after the zygote that sort of forms your own body so

2:22:44.240 --> 2:22:50.960
 these somatic alterations is something that has been previously inaccessible to study in human

2:22:50.960 --> 2:22:57.120
 postmortem samples but right now with the advent of single cell RNA sequencing and this particular

2:22:57.120 --> 2:23:01.280
 case we're using the well based sequencing which is much more expensive but gives you a lot richer

2:23:01.280 --> 2:23:07.200
 information about each of those transcripts so we're using now that richer information to infer

2:23:07.200 --> 2:23:13.200
 mutations that have happened in each of the thousands of genes that sort of are active in

2:23:13.200 --> 2:23:23.760
 these cells and then understand how the genome relates to the function this genotype phenotype

2:23:23.760 --> 2:23:29.520
 relationship that we usually build in GWAS between in genome wide association studies between genetic

2:23:29.520 --> 2:23:35.680
 variation and disease we're now building that at the cell level where for every cell we can relate

2:23:35.680 --> 2:23:42.160
 the unique specific genome of that cell with the expression patterns of that cell and the predicted

2:23:42.160 --> 2:23:47.280
 function using these predictive models that I mentioned before on dysregulation for cognition

2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:53.200
 for pathology in Alzheimer's at the cell level and what we're finding is that the genes that are

2:23:53.200 --> 2:23:57.920
 altered and the genetic regions that are altered in common variants versus rare variants versus

2:23:57.920 --> 2:24:02.880
 somatic variants are actually very different from each other the somatic variants are pointing to

2:24:04.080 --> 2:24:10.240
 neuronal energetics and oligodendrocyte functions that are not visible in the genetic

2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:14.960
 legions that you find for the common variants probably because they have too strong of an effect

2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:20.720
 that evolution is just not tolerating them on the common side of the allele frequency spectrum

2:24:20.720 --> 2:24:27.200
 so the somatic one that's the variation that happens after the after you individual I mean

2:24:27.200 --> 2:24:32.320
 this is a dumb question but there's there's mutation and variation I guess that happens there

2:24:32.320 --> 2:24:37.840
 and you're saying that they're through this if we focus in on individual cells we're able to detect

2:24:37.840 --> 2:24:44.160
 the story that's interesting there and that might be a very unique kind of important variability

2:24:44.160 --> 2:24:53.200
 that arises for you said neuronal or something that was energetics energetics so your your I mean

2:24:53.200 --> 2:24:59.680
 the metabolism of humans is dramatically altered from that of nearby species you know we talked

2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:05.200
 about that last time that basically we are able to consume meat that is incredibly energy rich

2:25:05.200 --> 2:25:13.040
 and that allows us to sort of have functions that are you know meeting this humongous brain

2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:17.840
 that we have basically on one hand every one of our brain cells is much more energy efficient than

2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:24.240
 our neighbors than our relatives number two we have way more of these cells and number three we

2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:30.560
 have you know this new diet that allows us to now feed all these needs that basically creates

2:25:30.560 --> 2:25:39.360
 a massive amount of damage oxidative damage from this huge super powered factory of ideas and thoughts

2:25:39.360 --> 2:25:45.920
 that we that we carry in our skull and that factory has energetic needs and there's a lot of sort of

2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:51.520
 biological processes underlying that that we are finding are altered in the context of Alzheimer's

2:25:51.520 --> 2:25:57.120
 disease that's fascinating that so you have to consider all of these systems if you want to

2:25:57.120 --> 2:26:02.000
 if you want to understand even something like diseases that you would maybe traditionally

2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:09.600
 associate with just the particular cells of the brain yeah the immune system the metabolic system

2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:14.400
 metabolic system and these are all the things that makes us uniquely human so our immune system

2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:19.520
 is dramatically different from that of our neighbors our societies are so much more clustered the

2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:24.720
 history of infection that have played the human population is you know dramatically different

2:26:24.720 --> 2:26:29.040
 from every other species the you know the way that our society in our population has sort of

2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:34.400
 exploded has basically put unique pressures on our immune system and our immune system has both

2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:39.840
 coped with that density and also been shaped by as I mentioned the you know vast amount of death

2:26:39.840 --> 2:26:44.560
 that has happened in the in the black plague and other sort of selective events in human history

2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:50.480
 famines ice ages and so forth so that's number one them on the sort of immune side on the metabolic

2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:56.080
 side you know again we are able to sort of run marathons you know I don't know if you remember

2:26:56.080 --> 2:27:00.640
 the sort of human versus horse experiment where the horse actually tires out faster than the human

2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:06.320
 and the human actually wins so on the metabolic side we're dramatically different on the immune

2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:11.600
 side we're dramatically different on the brain side again you know no need to sort of you know

2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:18.320
 it's a no brainer of how our brain is like enormously more capable and then in you know

2:27:18.320 --> 2:27:22.800
 in the side of cancer so basically the cancers that humans are having the exposures the environmental

2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:29.040
 exposures is again dramatically different and the lifespan the expansion of human lifespan

2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:37.520
 is unseen in any other species in you know recent evolutionary history and that now leads to a lot

2:27:37.520 --> 2:27:45.280
 of new disorders that are starting to you know manifest late in life so you know Alzheimer's

2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:51.360
 is one example where basically you know these vast energetic needs over a lifetime of thinking

2:27:51.920 --> 2:27:57.360
 can basically lead to all of these debris and eventually saturate the system and lead to you

2:27:57.360 --> 2:28:03.840
 know Alzheimer's in in the late life but there's you know there's just such a such a dramatic

2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:11.600
 set of frontiers when it comes to aging research that you know we'll so what I often like to say

2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:17.280
 is that if you want to re to to engineer a car to go from 70 miles an hour to 120 miles an hour

2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:22.000
 that's fine you can basically you know fix a few components if you wanted to now go at 400 miles an

2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:29.600
 hour you have to completely redesign the entire car because the system is just not evolved to go

2:28:29.600 --> 2:28:36.560
 that far basically our human body has only evolved to live to I don't know 120 maybe we can get to

2:28:36.560 --> 2:28:42.560
 150 with minor changes but if you know as we start pushing these frontiers for not just living but

2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:50.880
 well living the f zine that we talked about last time so to to basically push f zine into the 80s

2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:58.320
 and 90s and 100s and you know much further than that we will face new challenges that have you

2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:03.280
 know never been faced before in terms of cancer the number of divisions in terms of Alzheimer's

2:29:03.280 --> 2:29:08.080
 and brain related disorders in terms of metabolic disorders in terms of regeneration

2:29:08.080 --> 2:29:14.080
 there's just so many different frontiers ahead of us so I am thrilled about where we're heading

2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:20.880
 so basically I see this confluence in my lab and many other labs of AI of you know sort of you

2:29:20.880 --> 2:29:26.320
 know the next frontier of AI for drug design so basically these sort of graph neural networks

2:29:26.320 --> 2:29:34.960
 on specific chemical designs that allow you to create new generations of therapeutics these

2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:43.280
 molecular biology tricks for intervening at the system at every level these personalized medicine

2:29:43.280 --> 2:29:50.080
 prediction diagnosis and prognosis using the electronic health records and using these

2:29:50.080 --> 2:29:56.640
 polygenic race scores weighted by the burden the number of mutations that are accumulating

2:29:56.640 --> 2:30:02.400
 across common rare and somatic variants the burden converging across all of these different

2:30:03.280 --> 2:30:09.920
 molecular pathways the delivery of specific drugs and specific interventions into specific

2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:14.080
 cell types and again you've talked with Bob Langer about this there's you know many giants in that

2:30:14.080 --> 2:30:21.920
 field and then the last concept is not intervening at the single gene level I want you to sort of

2:30:21.920 --> 2:30:29.280
 conceptualize the concept of an on target side effect what is an on target side effect an

2:30:29.280 --> 2:30:33.680
 off target side effect is when you design a molecule to target one gene and instead it targets

2:30:33.680 --> 2:30:38.320
 another gene and you have side effects because of that and on target side effect is when your

2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:44.800
 molecule does exactly what you were expecting but that gene is pliotropic plio means many

2:30:44.800 --> 2:30:50.880
 tropos means ways many ways it acts in many ways it it's a multifunctional gene so you find that

2:30:50.880 --> 2:30:57.040
 this gene plays a role in this but as we talked about the wiring of genes to phenotypes is extremely

2:30:57.040 --> 2:31:03.200
 dense and extremely complex so the next stage of intervention will be intervening not at the

2:31:03.200 --> 2:31:09.040
 gene level but at the network level intervening at the set of pathways and the set of genes with

2:31:09.040 --> 2:31:15.280
 multi input perturbations to the system multi input modulations pharmaceutical or other

2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:23.120
 interventional and that basically allow you to now work at the sort of full level of understanding

2:31:23.760 --> 2:31:28.800
 not just in your brain but across your body not just in one gene but across the set of pathways

2:31:28.800 --> 2:31:34.640
 and so on so forth for every one of these disorders so I think that we're finally at the level of

2:31:34.640 --> 2:31:40.160
 systems medicine of basically instead of sort of medicine being at the single gene level

2:31:40.160 --> 2:31:44.800
 medicine being at the systems level where you can be personalized based on the specific

2:31:44.800 --> 2:31:50.880
 set of genetic markers and genetic perturbations that you are either born with or that you have

2:31:50.880 --> 2:31:56.080
 developed during your lifetime your unique set of exposures your unique set of biomarkers

2:31:56.080 --> 2:32:01.440
 and you know your unique set of you know current set of conditions through your

2:32:02.400 --> 2:32:11.280
 EHR and other ways and the precision component of intervening extremely precisely

2:32:11.280 --> 2:32:15.520
 in the specific pathways and in specific combinations of genes that should be modulated

2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:20.960
 to sort of bring you from the disease state to the physiologically normal state or even

2:32:20.960 --> 2:32:26.240
 to a physiologically improved state through this combination of intervention so that that's in my

2:32:26.240 --> 2:32:30.480
 view the field where basically computer science comes together with you know artificial intelligence

2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:34.880
 statistics all of these other tools molecular biology technologies and biotechnology and

2:32:34.880 --> 2:32:39.360
 pharmaceutical technologies that are sort of revolution and the way of intervention and

2:32:39.360 --> 2:32:43.200
 of course this massive amount of molecular biology and data gathering and generation and

2:32:43.200 --> 2:32:49.440
 perturbation in massively parallel ways so there's no better way there's no better you know time

2:32:49.440 --> 2:32:56.480
 there's no better place to be sort of you know looking at this whole confluence of of ideas

2:32:56.480 --> 2:33:01.120
 and I'm just so thrilled to be a small part of this amazing enormous ecosystem.

2:33:01.120 --> 2:33:06.560
 It's exciting to imagine what the humans of a hundred to twenty years from now what their life

2:33:06.560 --> 2:33:13.680
 experience is like because these ideas seem to have potential to transform the quality of life

2:33:13.680 --> 2:33:22.160
 that when they look back at us they probably wonder how we were put up with all the suffering

2:33:22.160 --> 2:33:29.120
 in the world. Minolas it's a huge honor thank you for spending this early Sunday morning with me

 at Lex Friedman and now let me leave you some words from Haruki Barakami. Human beings are

2:34:19.600 --> 2:34:26.480
 ultimately nothing but carriers, passageways for genes. They ride us into the ground like

2:34:26.480 --> 2:34:33.200
 race horses from generation to generation. Genes don't think about what constitutes good or evil.

2:34:33.200 --> 2:34:39.120
 They don't care whether we're happy or unhappy. We're just means to an end for them.

2:34:39.840 --> 2:34:44.400
 The only thing they think about is what is most efficient for them.

2:34:44.400 --> 2:35:04.960
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
