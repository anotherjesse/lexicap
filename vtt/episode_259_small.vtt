00:00.000 --> 00:04.900
 The following is a conversation with Thomas Tall, founder of legendary entertainment known

00:04.900 --> 00:10.620
 for producing blockbusters like Batman's Dark Knight Trilogy, The Hangover franchise,

00:10.620 --> 00:15.860
 Godzilla, Inception, Jurassic World, 300, and many more.

00:15.860 --> 00:20.940
 He runs Talco, which is an investment company that focuses on how artificial intelligence

00:20.940 --> 00:24.060
 can revolutionize large industries.

00:24.060 --> 00:26.740
 He is part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

00:26.740 --> 00:31.820
 He's the guitarist for the band Ghost Hounds that tours with the Rolling Stones.

00:31.820 --> 00:36.660
 But most importantly, he's humble, down to earth, and someone who has quickly become

00:36.660 --> 00:39.500
 a mentor and friend.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.540
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:45.020 --> 00:49.860
 And now, here's my conversation with Thomas Tall.

00:49.860 --> 00:56.620
 In 2004, you founded legendary entertainment known for producing blockbusters like Batman's

00:56.620 --> 01:02.020
 Dark Knight Trilogy, that includes Batman Begins, Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises,

01:02.020 --> 01:07.220
 The Hangover franchise, Godzilla, Inception, Jurassic World, 300, and the list goes on.

01:07.220 --> 01:10.540
 It's just some of the biggest movies in history.

01:10.540 --> 01:14.060
 What does it take to make an epic movie like that, or what does it take to make it happen

01:14.060 --> 01:15.980
 from start to finish?

01:15.980 --> 01:21.380
 Well, look, I've been enamored with movies since I was a kid as a fan.

01:21.380 --> 01:26.700
 And I think what you need is to be able to tell a great story.

01:26.700 --> 01:30.420
 And if you're going to tell a great story, you need a great director.

01:30.420 --> 01:38.220
 You got to start with a fantastic script that is able to take some of these iconic characters

01:38.220 --> 01:45.220
 that we did and put your own stamp on it while still respecting the mythology.

01:45.220 --> 01:50.300
 And I had zero experience in movies and television before I started legendary.

01:50.300 --> 01:53.500
 So it was a very interesting trip.

01:53.500 --> 02:00.900
 Total luck that we had the opportunity to make five movies at the time with Chris Nolan,

02:00.900 --> 02:04.580
 who turned out to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.

02:04.580 --> 02:07.740
 But each one is its own little startup company.

02:07.740 --> 02:12.260
 And I don't think there's any formula to get there.

02:12.260 --> 02:16.220
 But I know that if you don't have a great director and a great script, if you don't

02:16.220 --> 02:19.060
 have that foundation, it's hard to pull off.

02:19.060 --> 02:21.180
 Who is the CEO of that little startup company?

02:21.180 --> 02:22.900
 Is it the director?

02:22.900 --> 02:26.620
 Who would you say kind of defines the success or the failure of a movie?

02:26.620 --> 02:33.380
 Well, when you build a big movie like that, it's an enormous effort, 360 degrees.

02:33.380 --> 02:37.540
 I mean, from digital effects, it's certainly the actors.

02:37.540 --> 02:42.060
 I mean, if you have an amazing script and amazing director, but you don't believe anybody

02:42.060 --> 02:43.900
 playing the parts, that's a problem.

02:43.900 --> 02:48.900
 So the reason I think it was so difficult to pull off is I always used to say, you

02:48.900 --> 02:54.140
 start with a stack of papers with words on it called a script.

02:54.140 --> 02:59.020
 Bring that to life, and you're asking an audience to believe in everything that you're trying

02:59.020 --> 03:05.180
 to put out there, and you've got a cast that even if they're immensely talented individually,

03:05.180 --> 03:10.180
 they have to mesh together, they have to have chemistry together.

03:10.180 --> 03:15.580
 And the director is kind of the general on the battlefield, but if you have a strong

03:15.580 --> 03:22.540
 producer who's very hands on, but it truly to me is each one had its own story and its

03:22.540 --> 03:28.380
 own sort of how it came to be and why it worked or didn't work.

03:28.380 --> 03:33.260
 So you said you were new to the industry, but you did a lot of revolutionary things with

03:33.260 --> 03:34.660
 legendary.

03:34.660 --> 03:41.620
 So at that time, and now what is the good, the bad, and the ugly of the business of filmmaking?

03:41.620 --> 03:46.180
 What are some interesting holes that you were able to, or like problems that you were able

03:46.180 --> 03:51.300
 to fix, what problems still exist that can still be solved?

03:51.300 --> 03:58.300
 Well, look, the business has changed so radically since 2004.

03:58.300 --> 04:01.860
 When I started legendary, DVDs were still a cash cow.

04:01.860 --> 04:05.700
 So that's how far things have come.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.140
 But I would say a couple of things.

04:07.140 --> 04:12.980
 The reason that I started it from a business perspective was at the time it was a $30 billion

04:12.980 --> 04:19.660
 industry and there was no institutional capital around the movie business.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.900
 And I was fascinated by that because almost every other category that you look at of that

04:23.900 --> 04:29.580
 size as institutional capital, private equity, et cetera, is kind of a cottage industry set

04:29.580 --> 04:31.180
 up around it.

04:31.180 --> 04:35.300
 And I was perplexed and fascinated that that didn't occur.

04:35.300 --> 04:40.180
 And the way the movie business worked was unlike any business I'd ever looked at before.

04:40.180 --> 04:47.020
 So after kind of convincing myself that you could actually make money if you were disciplined

04:47.020 --> 04:52.740
 and had the right approach, you know, went out, raised the money from the capital markets,

04:52.740 --> 04:58.900
 markets which was Hercules, still maybe the hardest thing I've ever done in my career

04:58.900 --> 05:01.980
 to walk around and say, look, I have no experience.

05:01.980 --> 05:03.500
 I've never done this before.

05:03.500 --> 05:10.060
 But you know, and the second thing, being very fortunate at the time, was able to partner

05:10.060 --> 05:12.180
 up with Warner Brothers.

05:12.180 --> 05:17.380
 Warner's at the time was run by a man named Alan Horn, who besides being creative is also

05:17.380 --> 05:19.060
 a Harvard MBA.

05:19.060 --> 05:22.900
 So really understood what I wanted to do.

05:22.900 --> 05:28.260
 And Alan, you know, was just an absolute gentleman, someone that I still look up to

05:28.260 --> 05:33.860
 this day after Warner Brothers, he went and ran Disney with their run, you know, between

05:33.860 --> 05:36.460
 Marvel and Star Wars and everything.

05:36.460 --> 05:42.100
 So between Alan being responsible for Harry Potter, the Dark Knight stuff and then on

05:42.100 --> 05:45.540
 to all the Disney stuff, he probably had as great a career as anyone I've ever heard

05:45.540 --> 05:48.180
 of in the movie business.

05:48.180 --> 05:55.980
 So my first focus was around sort of two concepts, global worldwide large tentpole films and

05:55.980 --> 05:57.640
 franchises.

05:57.640 --> 06:03.300
 And then the business aspect of bringing long term institutional capital to bear.

06:03.300 --> 06:10.620
 I'm going to ask you dumb questions, which is part of the style, I guess.

06:10.620 --> 06:16.660
 But just for people who don't know, including me, what is institutional, what is capital,

06:16.660 --> 06:20.820
 what is institutional capital, what is equity, what is private equity?

06:20.820 --> 06:21.820
 Got it.

06:21.820 --> 06:22.820
 Okay.

06:22.820 --> 06:30.860
 So if you're starting a company and you go around to a bunch of your successful friends

06:30.860 --> 06:37.180
 and say, hey, you should invest in my company, well, that's sort of, that's great and it's

06:37.180 --> 06:44.900
 capital, but it's not getting money from Fidelity or TeeRow or, you know, a sovereign wealth

06:44.900 --> 06:52.060
 fund or an endowment fund from a university that has large pools of organized capital

06:52.060 --> 06:56.620
 that has a long term point of view on your business.

06:56.620 --> 07:03.100
 So if you get money from your neighbor who's a successful dentist, next year, the dentist

07:03.100 --> 07:07.460
 may say, hey, times are hard, I need my money back.

07:07.460 --> 07:12.620
 If your partners with, you know, Fidelity or Morgan Stanley or any of these institutions,

07:12.620 --> 07:17.620
 they have the capital and the wherewithal to say, okay, I'm looking in this over the

07:17.620 --> 07:23.860
 next five to 10 years and I thought there was an opportunity to bring that type of capital

07:23.860 --> 07:28.060
 to the movie business to be patient.

07:28.060 --> 07:34.900
 And the benefit of that patient, so it's a long term, you have to deal with fewer parties

07:34.900 --> 07:38.820
 and they would do much larger investments.

07:38.820 --> 07:42.780
 So what are the benefits, what are the sort of the challenges of that kind of investment?

07:42.780 --> 07:48.340
 Well, I think the benefits in some ways are they're professionals who are largely dispassionate.

07:48.340 --> 07:49.340
 Right?

07:49.340 --> 07:55.540
 It's like, look, if you're hitting the numbers you told me and you're hitting your plan, great.

07:55.540 --> 08:02.380
 And the other thing that always was interesting to me about the movie business is if I'm investing

08:02.380 --> 08:07.740
 in our artificial intelligence company or a chip set company or something like that,

08:07.740 --> 08:15.740
 a lot of the institutions don't have the technical expertise to really, truly grasp what's being

08:15.740 --> 08:20.580
 done so they don't, you know, other than good business practices, they're not offering every

08:20.580 --> 08:21.740
 little opinion.

08:21.740 --> 08:28.000
 The movies and television are completely approachable, meaning everybody has an opinion.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.620
 So you know, whether it's, I think you guys chose the wrong actor for that or why did

08:32.620 --> 08:34.620
 you do that move?

08:34.620 --> 08:39.500
 So it invites a lot more sort of second guessing and things like that.

08:39.500 --> 08:47.620
 So that was always one of the idiosyncrasies of the business that I thought was interesting.

08:47.620 --> 08:52.780
 And then when you talk about private equity versus public equity, if you're a public company

08:52.780 --> 08:58.340
 where the companies are traded, you want to buy Microsoft shares, you just go to your

08:58.340 --> 09:01.920
 broker, go on TD Ameritrade and buy them.

09:01.920 --> 09:08.420
 If on the other hand, you're talking about private equity, that's institutions or individuals

09:08.420 --> 09:11.220
 investing in private companies.

09:11.220 --> 09:16.860
 So thus the, if you have pools of capital that mostly invest in private equity deals,

09:16.860 --> 09:18.620
 that's how you think about it.

09:18.620 --> 09:23.860
 It's difficult to make those happen because it's individuals, you have to sort of what

09:23.860 --> 09:32.220
 have dinners and agree, so it's much less, it's a much more human, much less mechanical

09:32.220 --> 09:33.220
 I would say.

09:33.220 --> 09:34.220
 Yeah.

09:34.220 --> 09:41.020
 Now, and again, massive difference between large private equity shops who are professionalized

09:41.020 --> 09:47.620
 and in the same category that I mentioned earlier versus private individuals who are

09:47.620 --> 09:54.580
 wealthy or whatever, but again, it's much more individualized when you're going to people

09:54.580 --> 09:58.540
 who like your idea and just say, I'd like to invest in this.

09:58.540 --> 10:04.540
 Is that from all the kinds of investments you've seen, what do you think is the most

10:04.540 --> 10:11.340
 conducive to creating works of genius, whether that's in technology, AI space or whether

10:11.340 --> 10:12.900
 that's in movies?

10:12.900 --> 10:16.060
 So creating something special in this world.

10:16.060 --> 10:25.060
 I would say a couple of things, enough money that whatever endeavor you're going into that

10:25.060 --> 10:32.820
 you're not so nervous about the edges, right, if I have $100 to spend and I think I can

10:32.820 --> 10:39.460
 create a perpetual motion machine or something for $104, I can't do it because they're all

10:39.460 --> 10:40.700
 over me about the budget.

10:40.700 --> 10:45.740
 So I would say making sure that you have enough capital, making sure that that capital is

10:45.740 --> 10:51.580
 patient enough so that it's, you know, if you're going to do things that are extraordinary,

10:51.580 --> 10:55.180
 it takes some time and you're going to break stuff, right?

10:55.180 --> 10:59.220
 You're going to make mistakes, you're going to have a whole bunch of film on the cutting

10:59.220 --> 11:02.460
 room floor, so to speak, or if you're in the lab, you're going to have a whole bunch of

11:02.460 --> 11:04.420
 broken stuff.

11:04.420 --> 11:09.220
 And I also think it's very important at the beginning, and I always try to do this with

11:09.220 --> 11:16.460
 companies I invest in or buy is make sure that you have a philosophical and somewhat

11:16.460 --> 11:24.460
 mechanical alignment with the management team so that going in, you both understand, hey,

11:24.460 --> 11:27.900
 this is how we think about this problem or this company.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.660
 This is what we feel like our culture is.

11:30.660 --> 11:31.860
 This is what our goal is.

11:31.860 --> 11:37.700
 And these are the metrics by which we'll agree to measure them by because if you don't have

11:37.700 --> 11:44.180
 that shared, you know, hey, we're going to take this journey, then I think that's where

11:44.180 --> 11:47.180
 people get upset, disappointed, et cetera.

11:47.180 --> 11:52.180
 What about, this is a weird question, but constraints, so this is both for filmmaking

11:52.180 --> 11:54.820
 and investment.

11:54.820 --> 11:57.180
 Do you think more money is always better?

11:57.180 --> 11:58.180
 No.

11:58.180 --> 12:01.980
 So I like constraints a lot.

12:01.980 --> 12:11.460
 Like constraints and almost like a desperation and deadlines are catalysts for creativity,

12:11.460 --> 12:15.380
 for productivity, for sort of innovation.

12:15.380 --> 12:22.660
 So can you kind of speak to that as an investor, as a creator, like what's the right balance

12:22.660 --> 12:23.660
 here?

12:23.660 --> 12:30.420
 Well, I think if you're focused on a particular problem or a company or a thesis, if you have

12:30.420 --> 12:38.460
 that focus and you feel like I have unlimited resources or renewable resources.

12:38.460 --> 12:43.700
 So there's really, there's no leverage in the situation, right?

12:43.700 --> 12:49.420
 There's no, if I fail at this, I'll just go get more money, right?

12:49.420 --> 12:57.660
 I'll just go, I think that's a hard way to be resilient and to think of new ways to solve

12:57.660 --> 13:00.900
 problems.

13:00.900 --> 13:08.700
 So I think capitalizing things just to the nth degree does create some problems.

13:08.700 --> 13:14.500
 So I think there's that perfect blend of don't starve the oxygen to the point where you make

13:14.500 --> 13:20.500
 short term decisions or non strategic or thoughtful decisions because you got to pay the rent.

13:20.500 --> 13:28.220
 And on the other hand, you can't have it be like this everlasting gobstopper of whatever

13:28.220 --> 13:33.220
 you want will just keep flowing the cash because that doesn't create any friction points that

13:33.220 --> 13:44.620
 I think do result in works of genius and things that are transformative.

13:44.620 --> 13:54.060
 And one of the things that is interesting to me about society sort of writ large is

13:54.060 --> 14:02.220
 I think that when you go through hard times and you have to do things that are uncomfortable

14:02.220 --> 14:08.140
 and you don't want to do them because you're tired because you're that in some ways builds

14:08.140 --> 14:13.060
 up that you're comfortable being uncomfortable muscle.

14:13.060 --> 14:19.620
 And I sometimes think we're losing that a little bit and you can't sort of paint with

14:19.620 --> 14:27.380
 a wide brush, but you know, that's that's one of the things that I kind of observe

14:27.380 --> 14:30.420
 and hope that we don't go that way.

14:30.420 --> 14:37.060
 I do think challenge and discomfort are kind of gift is like overcoming that.

14:37.060 --> 14:41.180
 It's like from from every perspective, from a human perspective, it's a source of happiness

14:41.180 --> 14:46.780
 and fulfillment overcoming challenge, but from a business perspective, I see like if

14:46.780 --> 14:52.140
 something is really difficult to me, it's also a sign that most others would or many

14:52.140 --> 14:53.820
 others would fail at this point.

14:53.820 --> 14:56.020
 So like it's a feature.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.100
 It's nice that something is difficult.

14:59.100 --> 15:04.060
 When people tell you that something is impossible, I love that because it's like, all right,

15:04.060 --> 15:07.380
 well then that's what a lot of people would believe.

15:07.380 --> 15:11.220
 And that gives you an opportunity to be the person who shows it's not impossible.

15:11.220 --> 15:14.940
 And you of course, you might be wrong, but if you're not wrong, you have the opportunity

15:14.940 --> 15:15.940
 to stand out.

15:15.940 --> 15:20.420
 So going through that hardship, taking those big risks is going to really pay off.

15:20.420 --> 15:28.500
 So like discomfort is a is a feature, not a bug of both personal life.

15:28.500 --> 15:34.980
 It's just good for life, but for business, it seems like just good business sense.

15:34.980 --> 15:41.780
 If something is hard, it's probably a good idea to do that because most others will fail.

15:41.780 --> 15:42.780
 Fun question.

15:42.780 --> 15:47.060
 I don't know if you can answer this, but what's the most expensive movie you were involved

15:47.060 --> 15:49.900
 with to make and why was it?

15:49.900 --> 15:54.460
 You don't have to say numbers, but like, is something stand out as being exceptionally

15:54.460 --> 15:59.380
 expensive and why is it expensive?

15:59.380 --> 16:02.300
 I think Jurassic World was pretty expensive.

16:02.300 --> 16:06.140
 I mean, it worked out great.

16:06.140 --> 16:14.140
 And that's an epic film, by the way, look, it's it's it's one of my favorites.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.420
 They just did an amazing job.

16:16.420 --> 16:23.500
 And frankly, the crazy thing about my life is all the stuff that I loved as a kid somehow

16:23.500 --> 16:31.180
 came full circle back into my adult life and having the opportunity while I was out there

16:31.180 --> 16:38.220
 to to develop a friendship with Steven Spielberg and then have have my name on the same film

16:38.220 --> 16:39.220
 as Steven Spielberg.

16:39.220 --> 16:44.460
 I mean, that that was pretty surreal.

16:44.460 --> 16:46.980
 So that was an expensive film.

16:46.980 --> 16:49.900
 You know, Dark Knight Rises was was an expensive film.

16:49.900 --> 16:55.740
 But again, to me, there's a difference between expensive and irresponsible and expensive because

16:55.740 --> 17:01.300
 the vision warranted and it turned out financially, it certainly did.

17:01.300 --> 17:06.540
 Yeah, with Jurassic World, it's I mean, I can't even imagine having those meetings because

17:06.540 --> 17:11.140
 like you have to create so much and so much of it is obviously not real.

17:11.140 --> 17:14.260
 You can't bring dinosaurs in.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.860
 Yeah.

17:15.860 --> 17:22.100
 Is that where a lot of the cost is is in the, you know, the computer side of things?

17:22.100 --> 17:28.300
 Yeah, those are generally pretty massive components of the of the budget and especially

17:28.300 --> 17:32.700
 if you're doing it and inventing things as you go.

17:32.700 --> 17:40.860
 I mean, Jim Cameron is one of those filmmakers who, you know, is designing the plane as it's

17:40.860 --> 17:44.260
 flying in such a brilliant way.

17:44.260 --> 17:50.580
 And you know, I've got to know him over the years and just in awe of the way his brain

17:50.580 --> 17:54.660
 works and so yeah, it's a big component.

17:54.660 --> 17:59.700
 Can you speak a little bit more to him in terms of because you're such a fascinating

17:59.700 --> 18:03.020
 person because you care a lot about technology.

18:03.020 --> 18:06.140
 You care a lot about the cutting edge of technology.

18:06.140 --> 18:12.580
 So how does he a creator, a director build the plane while it's flying?

18:12.580 --> 18:15.980
 Like what's the role of innovation in this whole process?

18:15.980 --> 18:20.020
 Well, so I never made a film with Jim.

18:20.020 --> 18:26.540
 I'm just a huge fan and got to know him and John Landau, his producing partner.

18:26.540 --> 18:32.820
 And one of the things that just fascinates me about Jim is so he makes Titanic and there's

18:32.820 --> 18:37.580
 a bunch of underwater cameras and things that they need that don't exist.

18:37.580 --> 18:44.540
 So he goes and invents them and, you know, has a good grasp of engineering and has not

18:44.540 --> 18:50.380
 only the imagination, but the ability to lead a team to build them.

18:50.380 --> 18:56.580
 I got to go down early when they were shooting Avatar at a warehouse, I think it was where

18:56.580 --> 18:57.580
 they were shooting.

18:57.580 --> 19:03.060
 And as they were explaining to me how they were capturing it and that they could go back

19:03.060 --> 19:08.660
 later because they created the environment, it blew my mind.

19:08.660 --> 19:14.140
 And I said, okay, this is truly, people talk about a big leap, this certainly is one.

19:14.140 --> 19:21.020
 So he has continued to push the envelope in terms of the art of the possible.

19:21.020 --> 19:25.460
 And I just think he is an incredible genius in that way.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.820
 Again, another hard question.

19:27.820 --> 19:35.740
 So you in the realm of music care about story, storytelling, is there some aspect in which

19:35.740 --> 19:45.660
 money and beautiful graphics get in the way of story in filmmaking?

19:45.660 --> 19:52.420
 If you think about Jurassic World, obviously that's an experience like any other.

19:52.420 --> 19:58.540
 Like what do we, what do you think about the tension between story experience and like

19:58.540 --> 20:00.740
 visual effects?

20:00.740 --> 20:10.140
 Well, look, if you're using big effect shots and all kinds of tricks to cover over the

20:10.140 --> 20:14.980
 fact that you don't have a very interesting story to tell, that's where I think it gets

20:14.980 --> 20:18.140
 in the way.

20:18.140 --> 20:23.620
 Where I think you have these incredible filmmakers, we mentioned Chris Nolan and Jim Cameron,

20:23.620 --> 20:33.820
 Guillermo del Toro, you could go on and on of folks that just see the world differently

20:33.820 --> 20:43.460
 and use technology to enhance the storytelling, to make you believe differently, rather to

20:43.460 --> 20:49.540
 make you not just suspend your disbelief, but to feel like you're immersed in it.

20:49.540 --> 20:54.740
 So I've certainly seen it done expertly and I've seen it done poorly.

20:54.740 --> 20:57.660
 You've talked about this a little bit in the past.

20:57.660 --> 21:03.860
 You kind of left the movie making business at an interesting time.

21:03.860 --> 21:07.460
 Perhaps you saw the changes.

21:07.460 --> 21:10.260
 There's been a lot of excitement with Netflix, with TV.

21:10.260 --> 21:14.000
 So the role of film and society has changed.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.260
 So what do you think is the future of movies versus TV?

21:18.260 --> 21:24.860
 Like if you were as a business person, as a creator, as a consumer, as a technologist,

21:24.860 --> 21:32.020
 are thinking about the next 10, 20 years, what do you think is going to be the godfather,

21:32.020 --> 21:37.340
 the great pieces that move us as a society in the next 10, 20 years?

21:37.340 --> 21:38.340
 Is it going to be TV?

21:38.340 --> 21:39.740
 Is it going to be movie?

21:39.740 --> 21:43.820
 Is it going to be a TikTok clips?

21:43.820 --> 21:44.820
 What's it?

21:44.820 --> 21:51.020
 Well, and I think the other category that I would add to that, that will be the next

21:51.020 --> 22:01.380
 great medium, is truly immersive virtual reality in which new storytellers will emerge, especially

22:01.380 --> 22:08.740
 when you can go into VR and there's enough computing power to sustain it and to allow

22:08.740 --> 22:14.900
 it to be social and for you to have different paths to go down.

22:14.900 --> 22:19.820
 That'll be, I think, the next realm of what storytelling and experience will look like.

22:19.820 --> 22:25.500
 So do you think video game kind of world, or is it more movies, or is it more social

22:25.500 --> 22:31.740
 network, or is it all of it kind of blending reality and gaming and movies?

22:31.740 --> 22:32.740
 Yeah.

22:32.740 --> 22:38.620
 I thought if you saw Ready Player One, which I love the book and the movie was cool, too,

22:38.620 --> 22:46.100
 but that's one version of it, where you go in, now everybody's talking about the metaverse

22:46.100 --> 22:50.940
 and all that, but you go into a world that's fully rendered as yourself and you interact

22:50.940 --> 22:51.940
 with that world.

22:51.940 --> 22:58.100
 The other side of it is to go in somewhere between being a passive observer, but being

22:58.100 --> 23:03.420
 able to move around your point of view and experiences, which I think is interesting.

23:03.420 --> 23:09.620
 And then I think another adventure, so to speak, I could think of is a blend of video

23:09.620 --> 23:12.220
 games, so there's a mission, right?

23:12.220 --> 23:18.020
 There's obstacles, there's everything, and you move through it, but it's immersive and

23:18.020 --> 23:19.660
 it tells a story at the same time.

23:19.660 --> 23:27.020
 And that's why I think you're going to see new, amazing storytellers that we don't know

23:27.020 --> 23:34.660
 yet that understand how to innovate and how to make you feel something in that environment.

23:34.660 --> 23:45.900
 And to your earlier point, I saw probably around 2015 when Netflix decided to be bold,

23:45.900 --> 23:51.740
 put out House of Cards, put out all the episodes, leave you in charge of the pace at which you

23:51.740 --> 23:55.700
 would view them, which I thought was great.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.780
 That was a gutsy move.

23:57.780 --> 23:58.780
 Yes, it was.

23:58.780 --> 24:02.380
 And I can't tell you around Hollywood, anybody that says that everybody thought it was a

24:02.380 --> 24:10.260
 great idea is not being truthful because everybody I talked to said this is their idiots, right?

24:10.260 --> 24:13.780
 What do they know about moviemaking and TV?

24:13.780 --> 24:21.260
 And what I saw happening was if you look at what Netflix pulled off and they realized

24:21.260 --> 24:28.660
 that there isn't really a moat around the studios, you really could make stuff and really

24:28.660 --> 24:29.740
 good stuff.

24:29.740 --> 24:37.580
 And so they started to create their own content that pulled in Amazon, which pulled in Google

24:37.580 --> 24:43.620
 through YouTube and then you had Hulu, then you had Disney deciding that they're going

24:43.620 --> 24:44.620
 to have Disney Plus.

24:44.620 --> 24:49.540
 And the next thing you know, you have some of the biggest companies with the largest

24:49.540 --> 24:55.020
 balance sheets on the planet being in the creative business.

24:55.020 --> 25:00.820
 That's if you're an independent, that's bringing a knife to a gunfight to be sure.

25:00.820 --> 25:03.820
 And so I thought that was interesting.

25:03.820 --> 25:08.940
 The other thing that it used to be that movies were where the big things happened and television

25:08.940 --> 25:13.300
 was sort of small screen, different experience.

25:13.300 --> 25:18.620
 And you had something like Game of Thrones come out, which was not only on the same epic

25:18.620 --> 25:24.220
 level visually and storytelling wise, but had the budget to be able to do it.

25:24.220 --> 25:36.300
 And now, I think you're seeing all kinds of different storytelling taking place and also

25:36.300 --> 25:42.700
 like that you're not pigeonholed into a time like you got two hours to tell the story.

25:42.700 --> 25:45.500
 You can do a three part mini series, a five part mini series.

25:45.500 --> 25:49.540
 You can do television that's all kinds of different format.

25:49.540 --> 25:55.980
 That I think allows creators to do a lot more interesting things.

25:55.980 --> 26:02.660
 It is also interesting to consider the role of companies that enable that, like the capital

26:02.660 --> 26:04.860
 that enables that.

26:04.860 --> 26:11.420
 Without Netflix, you wouldn't an HBO, you wouldn't have some of these epic shows.

26:11.420 --> 26:16.900
 And so if we're thinking about the virtual reality world that you're talking about, it's

26:16.900 --> 26:19.180
 interesting to consider who will enable that.

26:19.180 --> 26:24.820
 You know, now, like you said, Facebook is talking about meta and metaverse, but it's

26:24.820 --> 26:29.260
 unclear that just having money is enough.

26:29.260 --> 26:31.580
 Netflix did a lot of really revolutionary stuff.

26:31.580 --> 26:35.860
 There's a, you know, Amazon has money, there's a lot of companies that have money that don't

26:35.860 --> 26:44.460
 quite do as good of a job yet at enabling creators of creating revolutionary new content

26:44.460 --> 26:46.740
 that changes the whole industry.

26:46.740 --> 26:50.180
 And that's probably going to be the case with virtual reality.

26:50.180 --> 26:57.620
 There is a lot of money needed to enable experiences like in terms of compute infrastructure.

26:57.620 --> 27:01.940
 There needs to be a huge amount of money there, but you also need to somehow give freedom

27:01.940 --> 27:10.580
 to creators to have fun, to do their best work, and at the same time, like provide the

27:10.580 --> 27:13.460
 perfect amount of constraints, all of that together.

27:13.460 --> 27:17.100
 Like however Netflix makes it happen, they do a pretty good job, because it's a very

27:17.100 --> 27:23.020
 constrained platform, but yet all the creators I've ever talked to, comedians and so on,

27:23.020 --> 27:27.780
 that work with Netflix are really happy because they feel free to create their work.

27:27.780 --> 27:33.260
 Yeah, and I think a lot of times, you know, companies are a letterhead, but it boils down

27:33.260 --> 27:34.260
 to the people.

27:34.260 --> 27:35.260
 Yeah.

27:35.260 --> 27:40.980
 And I think I've known Ted Sarandos a long time who ran the studio at Netflix and now

27:40.980 --> 27:48.540
 took over Fareed running the company, but Ted, very smart, talented guy and understood

27:48.540 --> 27:53.620
 early how to cultivate talent and relationships with talent, which is important.

27:53.620 --> 27:59.100
 When you're dealing with creative people, their motivations and their goals are not always

27:59.100 --> 28:00.100
 the same, right?

28:00.100 --> 28:02.740
 They're not always capitalistic, right?

28:02.740 --> 28:09.260
 And so in terms of being able to communicate with creative people that are not always A

28:09.260 --> 28:12.180
 to B to C is a talent.

28:12.180 --> 28:14.340
 And so I think they did a great job.

28:14.340 --> 28:20.820
 Ted did a great job with that early, you know, but I think that you're going to see different

28:20.820 --> 28:21.820
 formats.

28:21.820 --> 28:29.740
 And I don't think, I mean, going to a theater to see a massive movie on that screen in that

28:29.740 --> 28:33.340
 format is a fundamentally different experience.

28:33.340 --> 28:38.860
 And I think you're going to find movies, you know, my old shop Legendary just put out Dune,

28:38.860 --> 28:42.220
 which I thought was phenomenal.

28:42.220 --> 28:49.940
 I, you know, when we secured the rights to Dune years ago, it was over the moon because

28:49.940 --> 28:51.380
 it's I love the book.

28:51.380 --> 28:57.300
 I love the entire world that is Dune.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.900
 And that's a movie that I think you see on the big screen.

28:59.900 --> 29:06.500
 I think when Avatar 2 comes out, I want to see that on a big screen, but I think you're

29:06.500 --> 29:12.300
 going to see a ton of content is obviously being produced, and it's not all going to

29:12.300 --> 29:14.220
 go to a theater going experience.

29:14.220 --> 29:19.260
 So you're going to see, I think different versions of this over the next five to 10

29:19.260 --> 29:20.260
 years.

29:20.260 --> 29:22.260
 And James Cameron is listening to this.

29:22.260 --> 29:27.140
 So he officially agreed to talk at the time of, on this podcast at the time of Avatar

29:27.140 --> 29:28.140
 2 release.

29:28.140 --> 29:32.100
 I'm just holding you to that in this recorded conversation.

29:32.100 --> 29:38.380
 Also just super excited, both the movie and the director.

29:38.380 --> 29:41.300
 There's something special about movies.

29:41.300 --> 29:46.900
 You know, they win Oscars, they, they're historic in nature.

29:46.900 --> 29:51.300
 There's something about TV shows, even when they're epic like Game of Thrones, that they're

29:51.300 --> 29:54.380
 forgotten much quicker in history.

29:54.380 --> 29:55.380
 I don't know.

29:55.380 --> 30:00.060
 Maybe that's because we haven't had enough of them, but you know, the De Niro performances

30:00.060 --> 30:06.500
 and you know, the Scorsese films, all the great films that kind of we think of throughout

30:06.500 --> 30:10.380
 the generations that define generations are films.

30:10.380 --> 30:12.620
 Is that, is that just old school thinking?

30:12.620 --> 30:14.220
 Is that always going to be the case?

30:14.220 --> 30:21.900
 I mean, look, to me going in a darkened theater with a bunch of strangers and the lights go

30:21.900 --> 30:30.380
 down and you go on this journey, there is something special and magical about that.

30:30.380 --> 30:36.180
 And I think movies have been a part of our cultural fabric forever.

30:36.180 --> 30:44.540
 And for some reason, Hollywood in America was, you know, uniquely positioned to do a

30:44.540 --> 30:46.420
 great job with it, right?

30:46.420 --> 30:52.180
 Not that there aren't great foreign movies, but far and away, American movies, you know,

30:52.180 --> 30:57.700
 are dominate the, not only the world market, but you know, and so whatever it is that we

30:57.700 --> 31:03.740
 do well or Hollywood does well, you know, there's, there's something in the water apparently.

31:03.740 --> 31:11.100
 But I agree that I love movies and I will, you know, for the rest of my days.

31:11.100 --> 31:15.740
 It's interesting how creators can move back and forth now as well.

31:15.740 --> 31:17.420
 That used to be a complete no, no.

31:17.420 --> 31:23.940
 You're either a movie guy or you're a person or a, you know, or you're a TV director.

31:23.940 --> 31:24.940
 And that's that.

31:24.940 --> 31:27.900
 But those lines have completely blurred.

31:27.900 --> 31:28.900
 And they're also blurring.

31:28.900 --> 31:31.180
 I mean, they're blurring all kinds of lines.

31:31.180 --> 31:37.220
 Like they're, they're moving to TikTok and Instagram and like, I know right now it seems

31:37.220 --> 31:45.100
 ridiculous to consider that these like one minute things could be considered even in

31:45.100 --> 31:50.780
 the same realm creatively as a, as a film, but maybe that changes over time too.

31:50.780 --> 31:56.700
 Maybe experiences can completely become fluid in terms of their size, as long as they have

31:56.700 --> 32:02.340
 some deep lasting impact on you as a human being, as a consumer.

32:02.340 --> 32:10.260
 Look, to me, the whole thing is about either the moving image or even sometimes a picture

32:10.260 --> 32:13.580
 will bring out an emotion or reaction, something.

32:13.580 --> 32:19.380
 So, you know, short form is harder because you have less time to set things up and all

32:19.380 --> 32:20.380
 that.

32:20.380 --> 32:24.740
 But I'm sure there will be short videos and creators that come up with things.

32:24.740 --> 32:31.220
 And if a moving image can get a reaction out of you and make you feel a certain way and

32:31.220 --> 32:37.620
 stay with you or inspire you, well, that, that to me is just the next evolution of whatever

32:37.620 --> 32:40.540
 it's going to be between humans and cameras, et cetera.

32:40.540 --> 32:44.820
 See, I think that's why we've talked offline about this.

32:44.820 --> 32:50.180
 That's why I love robots is I think there's certain things in the short form with robots

32:50.180 --> 32:54.140
 that immediately can bring out a feeling in people.

32:54.140 --> 33:01.220
 There's something about our consideration of our own intelligence, of our own consciousness,

33:01.220 --> 33:06.940
 of all the fears and hopes and the beautiful things about human nature, the dark things

33:06.940 --> 33:12.700
 about human nature that somehow, especially legged robots bring out, because we have both

33:12.700 --> 33:15.460
 a fear and excitement towards that.

33:15.460 --> 33:20.820
 Are these going to be our overlords, our gods that overtake humanity?

33:20.820 --> 33:26.380
 Are these going to be things like horses or something like that, something that empower

33:26.380 --> 33:27.380
 humanity?

33:27.380 --> 33:29.140
 Like you don't know what to make sense of it.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.980
 That's why they're super exciting.

33:31.980 --> 33:38.100
 Speaking of robots and film, you've gone into traditional industries and disrupted them

33:38.100 --> 33:40.540
 quite a few times.

33:40.540 --> 33:45.940
 Was there, is there a system for deciding which industry is right for disruption?

33:45.940 --> 33:52.540
 Can you look at the world and see one of the big problems you would like to solve?

33:52.540 --> 33:56.660
 Do you have a system of how you see which problems to solve?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.700
 How do you look at the world?

33:58.700 --> 33:59.700
 Yeah.

33:59.700 --> 34:06.020
 Well, on the business side of that, so I have a holding company called Tolco, very imaginatively

34:06.020 --> 34:07.020
 named.

34:07.020 --> 34:14.540
 And part of that is literally every name ever is now taken, registered and all that stuff.

34:14.540 --> 34:16.940
 So we're a holding company.

34:16.940 --> 34:18.140
 What's a holding company?

34:18.140 --> 34:23.820
 So instead of being a fund that has money flowing in and out of it and there's what's

34:23.820 --> 34:29.300
 called a vintage year, I raise capital and I agree to invest that capital for so long

34:29.300 --> 34:33.900
 and then I give it back to you, which sometimes creates artificial time pressures and things

34:33.900 --> 34:34.900
 like that.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.260
 A holding company is more permanent capital.

34:38.260 --> 34:45.900
 So the idea was behind Tolco was to buy almost always whole companies or majority stakes with

34:45.900 --> 34:53.540
 great management teams in spaces that did not traditionally have a lot of innovation.

34:53.540 --> 35:02.020
 And to have our labs group who were data scientists, AI practitioners, you know, engineers, machine

35:02.020 --> 35:07.460
 learning, et cetera, and to be able to bring that wherewithal to that company.

35:07.460 --> 35:13.220
 So to provide them with the right capital and to provide them with access to technology

35:13.220 --> 35:17.940
 that would be hard to individually recruit for that company.

35:17.940 --> 35:24.940
 So I would say that the thesis was to look for industries that were large enough that

35:24.940 --> 35:31.300
 hadn't traditionally had access to that type of technology or innovation and to try to

35:31.300 --> 35:39.620
 look for companies that not only look that part, but had management teams that embrace

35:39.620 --> 35:42.100
 this and wanted to take that kind of journey.

35:42.100 --> 35:50.780
 Yeah, there is quite a few industries like that, but that finding the industries and

35:50.780 --> 35:57.740
 the management pair, because like those industries often have a lot of old school folks who don't.

35:57.740 --> 36:00.780
 It takes quite a bit of work for them to leap into technology.

36:00.780 --> 36:06.340
 I work quite a bit with the autonomous vehicles and just the automotive industry, depending

36:06.340 --> 36:07.340
 on the company.

36:07.340 --> 36:08.340
 There's old school folks.

36:08.340 --> 36:14.860
 It's like Detroit thinking versus like, what do you call it, I don't know, California thinking.

36:14.860 --> 36:19.740
 Well, I think you have to look at the nexus of two things there.

36:19.740 --> 36:22.700
 One is just plain old human behavior.

36:22.700 --> 36:29.020
 If I am uncomfortable, and this isn't a comfort zone for me, and it's not something I have

36:29.020 --> 36:33.660
 as a field of expertise, I'm going to shy away from that.

36:33.660 --> 36:38.100
 Especially if I'm successful and I feel good about myself and it's a big successful company

36:38.100 --> 36:42.180
 or person or whatever it might be.

36:42.180 --> 36:46.500
 The second thing is that especially if you're a public company and you're being weighed

36:46.500 --> 36:53.300
 and measured every quarter, you are rewarding the managers of that company to hit metrics

36:53.300 --> 36:58.740
 and to be reliable and to say, hey, I'm counting quarter to quarter that you're going to deliver

36:58.740 --> 37:01.020
 what you say.

37:01.020 --> 37:05.700
 It's difficult to say, you know what, everybody, for the next two years, I wouldn't count on

37:05.700 --> 37:10.860
 our financial projections at all, because we're going to reinvent what we're doing.

37:10.860 --> 37:15.180
 It's going to work in the long run, and you're going to see that this was a really smart

37:15.180 --> 37:18.980
 investment five to seven years from now.

37:18.980 --> 37:24.580
 That's not the way capitalism is currently wired, generally, right?

37:24.580 --> 37:32.700
 Again, if you reward managers with yearly bonuses and stock options based and tied to

37:32.700 --> 37:40.740
 stock price and all these other things, and then ask them to go break stuff, that's hard,

37:40.740 --> 37:41.740
 I think.

37:41.740 --> 37:50.700
 You're saying the talk or approach to this, the private investment is the best way or

37:50.700 --> 37:55.500
 perhaps the only way to enable this kind of long term innovation, investment, taking

37:55.500 --> 37:57.780
 big risks and investing in innovation?

37:57.780 --> 38:02.300
 Well, look, we certainly are not, by any means, the only one doing it.

38:02.300 --> 38:08.700
 I'm just saying that when you think about big companies, more successful that are in

38:08.700 --> 38:15.220
 old line businesses, and I hear people sort of talk about, well, why can't they just pivot?

38:15.220 --> 38:20.740
 They recognize they need to be in the technology business because it's hard.

38:20.740 --> 38:26.100
 It's hard to steer a ship and turn it that big, and especially if it's not part of your

38:26.100 --> 38:30.540
 DNA at that company.

38:30.540 --> 38:39.140
 I just think that what we tried to do is to enable management teams that know where they

38:39.140 --> 38:48.260
 want to go and to be patient with capital and also, again, bring innovation to bear

38:48.260 --> 38:51.100
 that they have access to.

38:51.100 --> 38:54.420
 There's plenty of capital structures doing interesting things.

38:54.420 --> 38:57.660
 That's one of the things I love about our country.

38:57.660 --> 39:06.140
 This country innovates, and this country invents things, and I'm constantly in awe of just

39:06.140 --> 39:15.100
 the human ability to innovate and to iterate.

39:15.100 --> 39:20.500
 I get to hang around some universities, including your old shop, MIT, and it's like...

39:20.500 --> 39:21.500
 I'm still there.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.500
 Yeah, still there.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.500
 Still teaching there.

39:23.500 --> 39:26.700
 Still teaching, but that place is like Hogwarts.

39:26.700 --> 39:31.220
 It's inspiring, right?

39:31.220 --> 39:37.540
 And certainly the energy in Silicon Valley, which now Austin, Texas, where we're sitting,

39:37.540 --> 39:41.740
 has its own incredible ecosystem.

39:41.740 --> 39:49.180
 That's one of the things I love about America is the ability, and that really is, I think,

39:49.180 --> 39:56.180
 in the American DNA, to create things and invent things, and I think that's invigorating.

39:56.180 --> 40:01.580
 I think that's even bigger than capitalism, the machine of how capitalism works.

40:01.580 --> 40:03.420
 That's just human nature.

40:03.420 --> 40:10.260
 Capitalism is just one of the ways to make that human nature shine, I suppose.

40:10.260 --> 40:16.420
 But it's like you mentioned MIT.

40:16.420 --> 40:21.700
 There's a drive there to invent, to innovate.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.740
 That's so purely human.

40:24.740 --> 40:28.300
 That human spirit to build something new.

40:28.300 --> 40:32.260
 It's that hopeful, optimistic spirit, especially in the engineering space.

40:32.260 --> 40:36.980
 If you pay attention to the internet, Twitter and all that kind of stuff, intellectuals

40:36.980 --> 40:43.540
 and so on, there's a cynicism to when we talk about stuff.

40:43.540 --> 40:47.020
 But there's an optimism to when we do stuff.

40:47.020 --> 40:52.660
 And the doing part, when you actually build things especially, you care a lot about manufacturing

40:52.660 --> 40:53.660
 too.

40:53.660 --> 40:59.380
 When you actually build physical products, that's where we truly shine.

40:59.380 --> 41:00.380
 Yeah.

41:00.380 --> 41:03.180
 No question about it.

41:03.180 --> 41:11.620
 I'm passionate about our country making stuff again, doing our own manufacturing and making

41:11.620 --> 41:18.340
 sure that we don't lose the ability not just to create things intellectually and do the

41:18.340 --> 41:22.340
 world's greatest blueprints, but actually make things here.

41:22.340 --> 41:23.340
 Actual factories.

41:23.340 --> 41:24.340
 That's exactly right.

41:24.340 --> 41:26.180
 How do we do that?

41:26.180 --> 41:31.180
 How do we bring more manufacturing to the United States?

41:31.180 --> 41:39.300
 There's a company that I have a big personal investment in called Rebuild with some folks

41:39.300 --> 41:45.140
 that all went through the MIT school years ago.

41:45.140 --> 41:49.820
 There's a good friend of mine named Jeff Wilkie who used to be at Amazon.

41:49.820 --> 41:55.620
 And we all felt the same way that America needed to make sure that it didn't lose its

41:55.620 --> 41:56.660
 edge in that way.

41:56.660 --> 42:04.260
 So it's a company that invests in American high tech manufacturing.

42:04.260 --> 42:09.660
 And I think the way that we do that is provide capital, provide training.

42:09.660 --> 42:16.660
 To me, this is also fertile ground for good, sustainable, high paying jobs.

42:16.660 --> 42:24.460
 And we have to make it economically feasible to do that again here in this country.

42:24.460 --> 42:28.660
 And not to say to companies that, again, are being weighed and measured quarter by quarter,

42:28.660 --> 42:33.300
 hey, this is three times as expensive to do it here, but you should do it here.

42:33.300 --> 42:40.180
 We need to innovate and we need to create processes and companies and opportunity that

42:40.180 --> 42:42.220
 balance that equation.

42:42.220 --> 42:47.340
 And I think as we saw during the pandemic, I don't think in this day and age you can

42:47.340 --> 42:50.340
 be an isolationist.

42:50.340 --> 42:51.740
 That doesn't make any sense to me.

42:51.740 --> 42:58.980
 But being self reliant and self determinant and making sure that you are never in a position

42:58.980 --> 43:04.660
 as a nation, that we can't do basic things because we're relying on supply chain in other

43:04.660 --> 43:05.660
 countries.

43:05.660 --> 43:12.620
 Whether it's we're not friends anymore or a natural disaster or a virus or something

43:12.620 --> 43:19.980
 pops up, I think those are costs of doing business that we have to put into the calculus

43:19.980 --> 43:23.020
 of being able to make things here.

43:23.020 --> 43:26.780
 There's an extremely high cost to making supply chain resilient that we really have

43:26.780 --> 43:28.100
 to consider.

43:28.100 --> 43:33.420
 And so if you really consider that cost, it makes a lot of sense to invest, especially

43:33.420 --> 43:38.860
 long term in building up manufacturing in a way where you're making most of the stuff

43:38.860 --> 43:48.580
 in one place, bringing it all, not all, but as much in as possible and building it almost

43:48.580 --> 43:51.300
 like from scratch here in the United States.

43:51.300 --> 43:59.940
 What I guess your thought is with innovation, it's possible to revolutionize the way we

43:59.940 --> 44:00.940
 do manufacturing.

44:00.940 --> 44:05.380
 It's possible to reduce the amount of supply chain stuff and build stuff from scratch,

44:05.380 --> 44:12.140
 do high tech manufacturing, optimize all aspects of the manufacturing, all that kind

44:12.140 --> 44:13.140
 of stuff.

44:13.140 --> 44:14.140
 Yeah.

44:14.140 --> 44:23.900
 And I think where technology is the most efficient is the human machine interface.

44:23.900 --> 44:28.540
 It's not let's automate everything and have nobody work anywhere.

44:28.540 --> 44:32.660
 For a long time, that's neither feasible nor desirable.

44:32.660 --> 44:42.820
 But where we can enhance jobs and make that interface immensely productive with the right

44:42.820 --> 44:47.460
 training and so forth, I think that's a worthwhile endeavor and something that's going to be

44:47.460 --> 44:48.780
 important to our country.

44:48.780 --> 44:49.780
 Yeah.

44:49.780 --> 44:53.060
 I mean, you know who you're talking to.

44:53.060 --> 44:57.340
 I love human robot interaction, human machine interaction, human AI interaction.

44:57.340 --> 45:02.460
 So what do you think is the role of robotics in this high tech manufacturing, sort of like

45:02.460 --> 45:08.260
 industrial robots, robotic arms, all that kind of stuff, or even more complicated kind

45:08.260 --> 45:09.260
 of robots?

45:09.260 --> 45:11.700
 What do you think is the role of robotics?

45:11.700 --> 45:16.380
 What do you think is the role of AI in this manufacturing future you're thinking about?

45:16.380 --> 45:20.340
 Well, robotics to me is an extremely exciting field.

45:20.340 --> 45:23.020
 I don't have the same expertise that you do.

45:23.020 --> 45:28.740
 I have an adjacency, but not the depth of knowledge, have never really delved deeply

45:28.740 --> 45:30.620
 into it or made investments in it.

45:30.620 --> 45:36.980
 But I think what's exciting about it is everything from doing jobs that are very dangerous for

45:36.980 --> 45:41.740
 humans, enhancing the human experience.

45:41.740 --> 45:48.540
 When you look at really repetitive labor, things that, you know, it might take away

45:48.540 --> 45:54.180
 a job, but is it a good job for that person is spending 30 years doing something highly

45:54.180 --> 45:55.180
 repetitious?

45:55.180 --> 45:59.100
 Is that a good experience in life?

45:59.100 --> 46:05.940
 So I think, and then when you think about everything from military applications, you

46:05.940 --> 46:09.140
 know, rescue, we're already seeing a bunch of those things.

46:09.140 --> 46:15.420
 And then just lastly, when you talk about that human interaction with robots, when you

46:15.420 --> 46:21.660
 start to have the combination, so you have some level of intelligence and interaction,

46:21.660 --> 46:26.740
 I mean, that's why we always love the droids and Star Wars, right?

46:26.740 --> 46:33.900
 I mean, it's, it's, it's exciting, it captures the imagination.

46:33.900 --> 46:42.700
 And I think, look, many, many hours and have been spent on debating artificial intelligence

46:42.700 --> 46:48.220
 and the, the ramifications if things go sideways and so forth.

46:48.220 --> 46:54.220
 And I think those are all, you know, those are appropriate conversations to be having.

46:54.220 --> 46:55.940
 AI is happening.

46:55.940 --> 47:03.340
 I think it's actually happening slower than most people realize because there are tasks

47:03.340 --> 47:10.220
 that humans do every minute of every day, standing up without losing your sense of balance.

47:10.220 --> 47:17.380
 These are really hard things, but I think there's enough investment both in private

47:17.380 --> 47:23.940
 industry as well as nation states now on artificial intelligence that it is coming.

47:23.940 --> 47:29.100
 So both in the software space, in the digital space and in the physical space.

47:29.100 --> 47:35.220
 So we talk about manufacturing, so industrial robotics is very true that even in the factory,

47:35.220 --> 47:43.700
 even in the tasks that you think are pretty basic, you know, the amount of small intuitive

47:43.700 --> 47:46.660
 decisions that humans make is quite incredible.

47:46.660 --> 47:52.700
 So we have to be kind of explicit about saying which tasks are actually really hard and humans

47:52.700 --> 47:55.060
 are just really good at them.

47:55.060 --> 48:01.500
 And so on the flip side, in the digital space, with social networks, we recommend our systems

48:01.500 --> 48:10.020
 with all kinds of like personal assistance in terms of voice based AI systems, all of

48:10.020 --> 48:11.020
 that.

48:11.020 --> 48:16.180
 There's opportunities there to find niches where AI can really have a transformative

48:16.180 --> 48:17.180
 effect.

48:17.180 --> 48:26.860
 I think one of the places that really haven't, this is where, like you were to say stupid

48:26.860 --> 48:33.100
 things, but I believe this very much, that when we have AI systems in the home currently,

48:33.100 --> 48:40.860
 you have somebody like Alexa and Google Home and so on, they're kind of very basic servants.

48:40.860 --> 48:44.620
 They tell you about the weather, they can play some music, they can turn the lights on

48:44.620 --> 48:47.580
 and off, all that kind of like smart home stuff.

48:47.580 --> 48:55.380
 I think there's a lot of value in systems that form relationships with us in the way

48:55.380 --> 49:01.700
 that pets to dogs and cats, I don't know, just for people who have cats, cats don't

49:01.700 --> 49:02.700
 care about you.

49:02.700 --> 49:03.700
 They really don't.

49:03.700 --> 49:05.100
 They don't form any kind of relationship.

49:05.100 --> 49:07.100
 I don't know why you have relationship with them.

49:07.100 --> 49:08.100
 It's one way.

49:08.100 --> 49:11.860
 Anyway, sorry, throw some shade.

49:11.860 --> 49:13.420
 I'm just kidding, by the way.

49:13.420 --> 49:17.460
 That's a basic kind of connection you have with another living being, then there's also

49:17.460 --> 49:18.460
 just friends.

49:18.460 --> 49:23.420
 You have different levels of friends, acquaintances, you have lifelong friends, all that.

49:23.420 --> 49:29.700
 That friendship you have, I really believe that there is some aspect of the human experience

49:29.700 --> 49:36.380
 that is deeply enriched by interacting with other beings.

49:36.380 --> 49:44.580
 For systems, computing systems, artificial intelligence systems in our world, to have

49:44.580 --> 49:51.820
 the capability to engage in some of that, I think is not just an opportunity to help

49:51.820 --> 49:56.420
 people grow, become better people, but it's also just a good business opportunity, too.

49:56.420 --> 50:01.740
 That hasn't really been explored enough, so that to me is really, that's a whole exciting

50:01.740 --> 50:08.740
 space that I think will enable better industrial robotics.

50:08.740 --> 50:14.420
 It will empower a better Facebook or a better social network, a competitor to Facebook that

50:14.420 --> 50:15.940
 overthrows Facebook.

50:15.940 --> 50:24.420
 It'll create better technologies that currently don't have that human robot interaction touch,

50:24.420 --> 50:26.700
 so I don't know.

50:26.700 --> 50:35.100
 That's super exciting to me, but that has to deal with the mess of human nature.

50:35.100 --> 50:41.300
 The reason that most robotics people and AI people stay away from humans, they stay away

50:41.300 --> 50:47.540
 from the human robot interaction problem is because humans are complicated, they're messy,

50:47.540 --> 50:56.460
 they're hard to control, they're hard to predict stuff about, they're hard to make sense of

50:56.460 --> 51:03.620
 or test repeatedly because one human can be drastically different from another human.

51:03.620 --> 51:07.580
 To deal with that is the robotics problem is super hard.

51:07.580 --> 51:14.140
 One of the questions is which problems can you remove the human from consideration when

51:14.140 --> 51:16.260
 you're trying to solve the problem?

51:16.260 --> 51:22.140
 Elon Musk is an example of somebody who believes autonomous driving, we can remove the human

51:22.140 --> 51:26.580
 from consideration, we can solve autonomous driving as a robotics problem.

51:26.580 --> 51:31.660
 It's stain lane, when there's a red light, you stop at a red light.

51:31.660 --> 51:37.340
 If there are humans in the picture like pedestrians, that's a ballistics problem, it's just treat

51:37.340 --> 51:43.660
 them as a moving object that would like 90% probability, keeps moving in the way they

51:43.660 --> 51:49.500
 were in the past few seconds with some smaller probability that might stop or turn.

51:49.500 --> 51:53.780
 Just do some basic models about them and you'll be able to do just fine.

51:53.780 --> 52:01.100
 I tend to believe that even driving has to consider the full messiness of humans.

52:01.100 --> 52:07.780
 The dance, the game theoretic dance of chicken that we all do when we J walk, we look at

52:07.780 --> 52:13.140
 the car, that driver doesn't have the guts to murder me, so I'm going to walk in front

52:13.140 --> 52:14.660
 of him and not look at the car.

52:14.660 --> 52:24.300
 We do that kind of dance and AI systems need to be able to do that kind of dance.

52:24.300 --> 52:33.140
 In Tolco, there's the labs, so there's a data science component, it's an AI component.

52:33.140 --> 52:37.860
 How do they go into a company and help revolutionize that industry?

52:37.860 --> 52:41.420
 Well, there's different examples.

52:41.420 --> 52:47.540
 One of our companies, FIGS, makes healthcare workwear started by these two brilliant women

52:47.540 --> 52:58.740
 and early days helping to build the platform and recruit and make sure that everything

52:58.740 --> 53:06.300
 that we did at the company embraced technology and at the same time, they were obsessive about

53:06.300 --> 53:11.420
 their customer, which is doctors, nurses, healthcare workers who are putting it on the

53:11.420 --> 53:14.260
 line every day and obsessive about their product.

53:14.260 --> 53:25.020
 When you have those two things come together, you get the result that we did at FIGS.

53:25.020 --> 53:31.860
 We have a company called Acashure, which its AI lab and base is down here in Austin, Texas.

53:31.860 --> 53:40.620
 It was an insurance, one of the largest insurance brokers in the world, and we did a deal with

53:40.620 --> 53:48.100
 them and sold some of our insurance holdings that was completely AI driven.

53:48.100 --> 53:53.100
 In that case, you basically put the team inside the company, right?

53:53.100 --> 54:00.540
 Because it's a massive company and we've gone into all kinds of things.

54:00.540 --> 54:06.580
 It just depends on the different situations, but the biggest thing was just to make sure

54:06.580 --> 54:12.500
 whatever the company needed, they had access to the talent.

54:12.500 --> 54:15.580
 Sometimes we'd build it, sometimes we'd help recruit for it.

54:15.580 --> 54:18.940
 You know how in technology, it's whatever works, right?

54:18.940 --> 54:21.820
 There's no one way to do things.

54:21.820 --> 54:27.620
 Well, Acashure is really interesting as an example, so insurance is a fascinating space.

54:27.620 --> 54:34.020
 It seems like very ripe still for disruption across the board.

54:34.020 --> 54:42.460
 It seems like a lot of the disruption has to do with almost the first dumb step of we've

54:42.460 --> 54:46.140
 been using mostly paper.

54:46.140 --> 54:47.900
 It's not digitized.

54:47.900 --> 54:53.540
 You have to basically create an infrastructure and a framework where everybody is using the

54:53.540 --> 54:59.260
 same digital system, like databases, and just organize the data.

54:59.260 --> 55:04.460
 It seems like that's a huge leap that basically can revolutionize major industries that still

55:04.460 --> 55:05.940
 hasn't been done.

55:05.940 --> 55:08.420
 Insurance is obviously the great example of that.

55:08.420 --> 55:14.140
 One of the things that struck me, the founder, CEO of Acashure's guy named Greg Williams,

55:14.140 --> 55:16.340
 they're out of Grand Rapids, Michigan.

55:16.340 --> 55:21.180
 As we were looking at expanding our footprint in insurance, I met with a lot of insurance

55:21.180 --> 55:22.420
 executives.

55:22.420 --> 55:29.300
 They would talk about technology, but Greg truly understood the power of what would

55:29.300 --> 55:37.700
 happen across actuarial sciences, predictive analytics, and using machine learning to really

55:37.700 --> 55:43.940
 run every aspect of your business, and then automating a lot of just the back office

55:43.940 --> 55:45.740
 tedious steps.

55:45.740 --> 55:53.260
 As you said, one of the things that was great for us, they already had a data collection

55:53.260 --> 56:00.220
 system and department, so it was much easier to pivot, and I'm very excited about the future

56:00.220 --> 56:01.220
 of that company.

56:01.220 --> 56:09.660
 They're doing some pretty innovative groundbreaking things, and those are the things that I like

56:09.660 --> 56:10.660
 doing.

56:10.660 --> 56:19.180
 Right, is that, yes, I want to make money, that's what that is, but at the same time,

56:19.180 --> 56:21.940
 what did you do with your time on earth?

56:21.940 --> 56:27.660
 Did you do anything to leave any kind of mark that you did anything interesting?

56:27.660 --> 56:29.580
 I can only speak for myself.

56:29.580 --> 56:35.700
 There are many more ways to measure one's life, and I can only speak about how I think

56:35.700 --> 56:37.940
 about things.

56:37.940 --> 56:42.740
 I grew up poor in upstate New York, with a single mom, and watched her work a couple

56:42.740 --> 56:50.540
 jobs and had to, from a young age, shovel snow and mow lawns and do all kinds of things

56:50.540 --> 56:56.740
 to help her make sure the lights weren't turned off in our little place.

56:56.740 --> 57:05.300
 That's just something that I've always been driven towards, and I have a really eclectic

57:05.300 --> 57:11.420
 taste and interest, and it's just been an interesting journey.

57:11.420 --> 57:22.660
 So help be part of and help enable some cool new creations across the board, like film,

57:22.660 --> 57:33.500
 music, AI, manufacturing, insurance, all the specific industries that you disrupted.

57:33.500 --> 57:43.060
 Child tangent, back to your childhood with your mom, any memories stand out, stick with

57:43.060 --> 57:49.620
 you as something that helped define who you are as a man?

57:49.620 --> 57:59.300
 Even though the university and college experience was not part of the family tree, and we had

57:59.300 --> 58:00.300
 no connections.

58:00.300 --> 58:03.980
 I didn't understand, I didn't know what a trust fund was, or prep school, I didn't

58:03.980 --> 58:07.260
 know what any of that was.

58:07.260 --> 58:12.340
 But my mom from a young age would always say, you know, you're going to go to college.

58:12.340 --> 58:17.780
 There's no, you know, if you choose to, and I think from a young age, that was just an

58:17.780 --> 58:22.500
 expectation that I had and that she instilled.

58:22.500 --> 58:29.580
 And the work ethic, I watched her, and then my grandmother was a janitor, a cleaning lady

58:29.580 --> 58:32.020
 in a hospital for 50 years.

58:32.020 --> 58:38.260
 And then I remember there were times of, you know, I'm probably 10 years old, it's freezing

58:38.260 --> 58:39.260
 cold out.

58:39.260 --> 58:45.220
 And if I don't go out and shovel six driveways, we don't have enough money to pay the bill.

58:45.220 --> 58:51.220
 So I don't know, I'm not a psychologist, so I don't know how that manifests itself in

58:51.220 --> 59:00.500
 my life today, but I think the grit to say, I'm not in the mood to do this, I don't want

59:00.500 --> 59:04.860
 to do this, but that's the work that needs to be done.

59:04.860 --> 59:10.780
 And no excuses, not I'm a victim, and I'm going to sit around and talk about, no, it

59:10.780 --> 59:15.380
 is what it is, and you have to get done what you need to get done.

59:15.380 --> 59:23.140
 And again, I think it's, you can never fully put yourself in someone else's shoes or experience,

59:23.140 --> 59:25.540
 because I don't know what that is or feels like.

59:25.540 --> 59:33.860
 But for me, those were two, I think, formative things that were important in my childhood.

59:33.860 --> 59:38.500
 So that's pretty, the reality of life like that is pretty humbling.

59:38.500 --> 59:45.260
 You still, you've been so exceptionally successful that it's easy to get soft now.

59:45.260 --> 59:49.300
 How do you get humble these days?

59:49.300 --> 59:58.060
 By getting up, I think for me personally, trying to push the envelope and being weighed

59:58.060 --> 1:00:02.700
 and measured, that's why I always love sports too, there's a scoreboard.

1:00:02.700 --> 1:00:11.620
 And I'm a huge believer in opportunity, meritocracy, all those things that I think are ideals that

1:00:11.620 --> 1:00:19.340
 we want to aspire to, and I think that there's a lot of things I'm involved with right now

1:00:19.340 --> 1:00:26.460
 that I just want to see if I can do it, I want to see if, you know, if, and, you know,

1:00:26.460 --> 1:00:32.020
 my own little mantra is cause the outcome, right, as much as you can, and at the same

1:00:32.020 --> 1:00:37.540
 time have the humility and not to have the hubris or arrogance to say, I'm always going

1:00:37.540 --> 1:00:43.140
 to cause the outcome because you'll get your ass kicked pretty quickly and humbled.

1:00:43.140 --> 1:00:49.340
 The world and the universe is a big place with forces, you know, beyond.

1:00:49.340 --> 1:00:57.180
 But I think, you know, I also think a lot about being intellectually honest, which when

1:00:57.180 --> 1:01:02.940
 I do university talks and so forth, I think that's a superpower.

1:01:02.940 --> 1:01:10.540
 Because if you find yourself making decisions based on other people's expectations, based

1:01:10.540 --> 1:01:18.140
 on places you don't want to go, but, you know, you're either, you feel like momentum is taking

1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:20.660
 you there.

1:01:20.660 --> 1:01:22.220
 I think that's a big problem.

1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:30.060
 And there are people that go to our top universities and can't wait to get out and start their own

1:01:30.060 --> 1:01:36.300
 company and they want that pressure and they want to grind and there are other people that

1:01:36.300 --> 1:01:41.940
 are smart and talented, but just say, look, I don't want to lay awake staring at the ceiling

1:01:41.940 --> 1:01:43.660
 wondering how I'm going to make payroll.

1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:45.580
 I don't want that in my life.

1:01:45.580 --> 1:01:50.660
 And I think if you can square that up and be okay with it and say, what, what makes

1:01:50.660 --> 1:01:51.660
 me tick?

1:01:51.660 --> 1:01:52.900
 What makes me happy?

1:01:52.900 --> 1:01:57.860
 What puts me in a bad headspace because there's a difference between challenging yourself

1:01:57.860 --> 1:02:00.180
 and going against your nature.

1:02:00.180 --> 1:02:05.380
 So that's why I think that being intellectually honest and being able to really sit down and

1:02:05.380 --> 1:02:08.900
 go inside your own head and say, what am I good at?

1:02:08.900 --> 1:02:10.620
 What am I not good at?

1:02:10.620 --> 1:02:14.180
 How am I going to put myself in a position to be successful?

1:02:14.180 --> 1:02:20.220
 Because, you know, I'm working on my weaknesses, but I'm not going to put myself career wise

1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:28.300
 in a position where I, I'm just fundamentally going to have a hard time being successful.

1:02:28.300 --> 1:02:29.300
 Yeah.

1:02:29.300 --> 1:02:35.540
 Intellectually honest is a tricky one and it gets, there's like levels to it too.

1:02:35.540 --> 1:02:36.540
 Sure.

1:02:36.540 --> 1:02:44.860
 Because some of the things, you know, I think about when you, when you dream of doing certain

1:02:44.860 --> 1:02:53.780
 kinds of big things, a part of intellectual honesty is to say several things.

1:02:53.780 --> 1:03:02.100
 One is like, hey, the thing you're dreaming about, like one, the fact that nobody's done

1:03:02.100 --> 1:03:09.140
 it probably shows that you're, you know, you're just a dreamer.

1:03:09.140 --> 1:03:13.140
 This is not, this is not going to like think clearly.

1:03:13.140 --> 1:03:17.980
 The fact that it hasn't been done probably shows that it may not be the right path.

1:03:17.980 --> 1:03:23.020
 And two is like, if you're dreaming about stuff, there's a certain point where it's

1:03:23.020 --> 1:03:25.980
 like, hey, you haven't done it.

1:03:25.980 --> 1:03:27.860
 Like why haven't you done it already then?

1:03:27.860 --> 1:03:29.300
 Like you have to be honest with yourself.

1:03:29.300 --> 1:03:36.460
 Like you have to be ambitious like, you know, a lot of people work hard a long time for

1:03:36.460 --> 1:03:41.100
 a dream, but you have to wake up and be like, all right, I've been at this for 10 years.

1:03:41.100 --> 1:03:46.900
 Like with a startup, you launch a startup and you think, okay, one year, two years,

1:03:46.900 --> 1:03:49.980
 three years, four years, pretty successful, you know, but it hasn't exploded.

1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:55.100
 Like you dreamed and you have to shut it down, you know, you have to be intellectual

1:03:55.100 --> 1:03:56.100
 honest there.

1:03:56.100 --> 1:04:07.500
 At the same time, you might want to be like step it up, lean into it, say almost like

1:04:07.500 --> 1:04:14.380
 the flip side of like intellectual honesty is like maddening ambition of just saying,

1:04:14.380 --> 1:04:17.020
 fuck it, I'm going to go all in.

1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:21.460
 But that is a kind of intellectual honesty saying like, you know, the big problem here

1:04:21.460 --> 1:04:26.460
 is I've been kind of going and doing too many things.

1:04:26.460 --> 1:04:30.060
 Maybe with this dream, you have to go all in on it.

1:04:30.060 --> 1:04:31.060
 All those kinds of things.

1:04:31.060 --> 1:04:32.300
 I mean, this is human experience.

1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:33.300
 It's complicated.

1:04:33.300 --> 1:04:37.660
 Yes, without all human things are complicated.

1:04:37.660 --> 1:04:43.420
 And I think there's a difference between being reckless and making well thought out

1:04:43.420 --> 1:04:45.060
 informed decisions.

1:04:45.060 --> 1:04:51.140
 If you're going to go all in, make sure you've, you know, measure twice cut once as they say.

1:04:51.140 --> 1:04:57.060
 And one of my other favorite, I forget many years ago, I heard this saying and it stayed

1:04:57.060 --> 1:04:58.060
 with me.

1:04:58.060 --> 1:05:08.460
 Never mistake clear line of sight with distance and, you know, that so I think that the key,

1:05:08.460 --> 1:05:12.020
 whether you're starting a business or you're thinking about leaving the company you're

1:05:12.020 --> 1:05:17.060
 at and starting a business or just leaving for another job, any of these things is as

1:05:17.060 --> 1:05:19.220
 much as you can, right?

1:05:19.220 --> 1:05:24.460
 And psychologists, I think would tell us it's hard to be self aware completely, right?

1:05:24.460 --> 1:05:28.900
 That's the rub that if we were all completely self aware of everything that we did and strengthen

1:05:28.900 --> 1:05:32.540
 weaknesses, it'd be a different world.

1:05:32.540 --> 1:05:39.300
 But I do think you can work on that and at least challenge yourself to think about it

1:05:39.300 --> 1:05:44.260
 and not be in a position where I'm, you know, I'm going to medical school because that's

1:05:44.260 --> 1:05:45.740
 what you do in my family.

1:05:45.740 --> 1:05:51.100
 And even though I'm miserable doing it, you know, things like that.

1:05:51.100 --> 1:06:00.020
 So definitely you don't want to be sort of, because you don't think fall victim to conformity.

1:06:00.020 --> 1:06:02.340
 Let's just go on doing the same thing over and over.

1:06:02.340 --> 1:06:03.340
 That's right.

1:06:03.340 --> 1:06:11.620
 But at the same time, is measure twice and cut once.

1:06:11.620 --> 1:06:20.580
 It does feel like some of the, the biggest leaps taken are where you cut once and measure

1:06:20.580 --> 1:06:24.340
 later is you leap in first.

1:06:24.340 --> 1:06:25.340
 Sure.

1:06:25.340 --> 1:06:26.980
 So it's almost like a gut.

1:06:26.980 --> 1:06:32.220
 I suppose that is a measurement, but you build up a good gut instinct of like what to do

1:06:32.220 --> 1:06:37.300
 and then you just do it and then you figure out as the building the airplane as you're

1:06:37.300 --> 1:06:38.300
 flying it.

1:06:38.300 --> 1:06:39.300
 Right.

1:06:39.300 --> 1:06:46.180
 Well, and I think each one of those instances that you could probably cite has its own unique

1:06:46.180 --> 1:06:47.700
 circumstances, right?

1:06:47.700 --> 1:06:50.420
 I don't have a deep biotech background.

1:06:50.420 --> 1:06:57.020
 So if I suddenly stood up and said, I'm going to put everything I have into this idea, well,

1:06:57.020 --> 1:06:59.940
 that's, you know, those are, right, it's game theory, right?

1:06:59.940 --> 1:07:02.020
 What are the odds of success?

1:07:02.020 --> 1:07:07.900
 If on the other hand, you know, you're, you're brilliant in your field or you've seen some

1:07:07.900 --> 1:07:15.380
 opportunity that you, you think is wide open and you're going to go for it and break stuff.

1:07:15.380 --> 1:07:16.380
 That's great.

1:07:16.380 --> 1:07:23.460
 And you just want to wait, to me, always say like, how crazy is this on the spectrum of,

1:07:23.460 --> 1:07:25.980
 you know, do I have any expertise?

1:07:25.980 --> 1:07:30.140
 What is the downside if I fail, right?

1:07:30.140 --> 1:07:35.940
 You know, if you're, if you're at a certain point in life with young children and you've

1:07:35.940 --> 1:07:40.420
 got a mortgage and whatever else that, that is one circumstance versus I just got on a

1:07:40.420 --> 1:07:44.940
 Stanford or I just got out of whatever and I'm going to go for it.

1:07:44.940 --> 1:07:47.580
 It's just the whole thing, right?

1:07:47.580 --> 1:07:50.180
 It is complex as you point out.

1:07:50.180 --> 1:07:55.340
 And sometimes you just want to have the right matrix in your head of decision making process

1:07:55.340 --> 1:07:57.780
 to try to arrive at the right place.

1:07:57.780 --> 1:08:02.180
 And even if you get close, that's where I think you say, you know what, the hell with

1:08:02.180 --> 1:08:04.180
 it, I'm doing this.

1:08:04.180 --> 1:08:05.180
 Yeah.

1:08:05.180 --> 1:08:06.180
 Yeah.

1:08:06.180 --> 1:08:12.820
 I do want to ask you about one specific idea that sounds super fascinating that you're

1:08:12.820 --> 1:08:13.980
 involved with recently.

1:08:13.980 --> 1:08:22.940
 You led the $50 million C round for a company called Colossal that is focused on de extinction.

1:08:22.940 --> 1:08:28.640
 This is funny relative to our connection and conversation about Jurassic World.

1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:33.500
 They're seeking to restore lost ecosystems and use gene editing to restore the woolly

1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:36.500
 mammoth to the Arctic tundra.

1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:39.700
 How are they going to do that?

1:08:39.700 --> 1:08:48.820
 Well, I met this fascinating guy at Harvard named George Church five, six years ago and

1:08:48.820 --> 1:08:58.820
 found him to be incredibly smart, have an imagination and he partnered up with a guy

1:08:58.820 --> 1:09:02.700
 named Ben Lamb who's an entrepreneur.

1:09:02.700 --> 1:09:12.420
 And basically the press and to me, the imaginative, like you're capturing my imagination by telling

1:09:12.420 --> 1:09:15.660
 me you're going to bring back the woolly mammoth and other extinct animals.

1:09:15.660 --> 1:09:18.700
 And I, you know, we'll see where that road leads.

1:09:18.700 --> 1:09:26.100
 I was more interested in an investor in the things that they're working through around

1:09:26.100 --> 1:09:34.860
 understanding genes and proteins and CRISPR and all these other things because being adjacent

1:09:34.860 --> 1:09:41.980
 to George Church and his team as these things unfold over the next decade, I thought was

1:09:41.980 --> 1:09:42.980
 the right thing to do.

1:09:42.980 --> 1:09:47.460
 So people are important here, just like investing in people and seeing what the hell they come

1:09:47.460 --> 1:09:48.460
 up with.

1:09:48.460 --> 1:09:49.460
 Absolutely.

1:09:49.460 --> 1:09:57.460
 You can look through history and great things are done by great people, right?

1:09:57.460 --> 1:10:04.900
 And companies, they end up over time becoming a logo and immediately what you think of them,

1:10:04.900 --> 1:10:11.340
 but they started out with a person, with an idea and a team that cultivated that and made

1:10:11.340 --> 1:10:14.220
 that happen.

1:10:14.220 --> 1:10:19.300
 And I think there are certain folks that are just immensely talented that if you can be

1:10:19.300 --> 1:10:27.700
 around them, and I also know his and his team's ethics in terms of, you know, after spending

1:10:27.700 --> 1:10:35.380
 time talking about where the lines are, people in other countries that, you know, may not

1:10:35.380 --> 1:10:41.660
 have the same process, may not have the same checks and balances are doing this and pursuing

1:10:41.660 --> 1:10:42.660
 this regardless.

1:10:42.660 --> 1:10:47.620
 So at least I felt like with George and Ben and their teams, they're also very responsible

1:10:47.620 --> 1:10:49.620
 people.

1:10:49.620 --> 1:10:53.540
 This is where the human side of things comes into play.

1:10:53.540 --> 1:10:58.820
 I've interacted with a lot of really brilliant people in the technology space where you kind

1:10:58.820 --> 1:11:01.580
 of, you know, there's a lot of ways to feel this all.

1:11:01.580 --> 1:11:04.220
 You can ask them whether they kind of read literature.

1:11:04.220 --> 1:11:12.380
 You can feel out how much they really understand about like human nature here.

1:11:12.380 --> 1:11:21.260
 Like whatever the technology is when it actually starts to play, interact with society at scale.

1:11:21.260 --> 1:11:26.540
 Like do they have an understanding or an intuition about how that happens?

1:11:26.540 --> 1:11:28.260
 Some of that requires studying history.

1:11:28.260 --> 1:11:34.820
 Some of that requires like just looking at the worst and best parts and events in human

1:11:34.820 --> 1:11:42.100
 history to understand like, hey, it doesn't always turn out like everybody hoped the technology

1:11:42.100 --> 1:11:44.020
 turns out.

1:11:44.020 --> 1:11:51.420
 If a person has a depth of understanding about history, about human nature, then I think

1:11:51.420 --> 1:11:56.660
 that's the right person to mess with some of this cutting edge stuff.

1:11:56.660 --> 1:12:00.900
 You want Marcus Aurelius with a PhD from MIT.

1:12:00.900 --> 1:12:01.900
 Exactly.

1:12:01.900 --> 1:12:02.900
 Exactly.

1:12:02.900 --> 1:12:09.180
 You just small tangent, but you mentioned having a conversation with Warren Buffett.

1:12:09.180 --> 1:12:15.820
 You spoke really highly of him as an investor, as a human being.

1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:18.460
 What about him do you admire?

1:12:18.460 --> 1:12:23.540
 What insights have you drawn from him as a great investor yourself?

1:12:23.540 --> 1:12:27.860
 Well, the afternoon that I got to spend with him, which, you know, is something I'll treasure

1:12:27.860 --> 1:12:28.860
 forever.

1:12:28.860 --> 1:12:36.540
 Look, sometimes when you meet people, even that are immensely successful, you may decide

1:12:36.540 --> 1:12:42.180
 that after 20 minutes or a half hour, oh, you were in the right place at the right time

1:12:42.180 --> 1:12:45.820
 and, you know, that's fine.

1:12:45.820 --> 1:12:51.580
 There are other people that are clearly different, special, and I don't care if you made them

1:12:51.580 --> 1:12:57.260
 start from zero, you know, would end up in a good place.

1:12:57.260 --> 1:13:04.540
 And so it was an absolute privilege to spend the time with him, you know, and a couple

1:13:04.540 --> 1:13:08.700
 of things that stood out in the conversation.

1:13:08.700 --> 1:13:13.020
 He is incredibly intellectually curious and well read.

1:13:13.020 --> 1:13:18.060
 And I like how simplistic he likes to keep his thought matrix.

1:13:18.060 --> 1:13:25.180
 And then also, instead of trying to outsmart the market, it seems like a simple axiom,

1:13:25.180 --> 1:13:32.620
 but just look, good companies that are led by talented managers that are good businesses

1:13:32.620 --> 1:13:35.220
 over time are going to get there.

1:13:35.220 --> 1:13:40.540
 So I'm not going to day trade, I'm just going to, I'm looking for value.

1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:49.140
 And then just on life stuff, he just, you know, and also his ability to take in and

1:13:49.140 --> 1:13:54.780
 then use information, it was incredibly impressive.

1:13:54.780 --> 1:13:59.980
 So I only spent the, you know, I'd met him before, but I only spent one afternoon with

1:13:59.980 --> 1:14:02.860
 him, but it's, you know, pretty incredible.

1:14:02.860 --> 1:14:07.820
 And one of the things that stuck out to me is we were in the middle of talking about

1:14:07.820 --> 1:14:10.900
 Tulco or investing or how we thought about it.

1:14:10.900 --> 1:14:16.340
 And I said, you know, I'm trying to be smart about, and he stopped me and he said, Charlie

1:14:16.340 --> 1:14:20.020
 Munger, his partner of many years, Charlie and I don't try to think of the smart thing

1:14:20.020 --> 1:14:21.100
 to do.

1:14:21.100 --> 1:14:24.260
 We try to think, what's the dumb thing we could do here?

1:14:24.260 --> 1:14:28.200
 And I kind of laughed and he said, no, I'm dead serious.

1:14:28.200 --> 1:14:34.060
 We think about it from the standpoint of what could we do in this situation that later

1:14:34.060 --> 1:14:37.580
 we'd be like, that was a really dumb thing to do.

1:14:37.580 --> 1:14:43.420
 And I actually thought that was, it got in my head and I still think a lot about that

1:14:43.420 --> 1:14:46.980
 as I'm dissecting problems.

1:14:46.980 --> 1:14:54.020
 So there's a, like, that's a kind of long term thinking if you just avoid the dumb things

1:14:54.020 --> 1:15:01.380
 or if you simplify, just focus on those simple steps, all it takes is just do that for a

1:15:01.380 --> 1:15:04.740
 long period of time and you'll be successful.

1:15:04.740 --> 1:15:07.940
 It certainly worked for him, that's all I can say.

1:15:07.940 --> 1:15:10.340
 What about you?

1:15:10.340 --> 1:15:14.780
 You've been a great investor yourself.

1:15:14.780 --> 1:15:21.580
 How do you know, when you judge people, so I, whenever I go to San Francisco, I was thinking

1:15:21.580 --> 1:15:26.420
 of moving to San Francisco, that's why I decided to, after really giving it some thought and

1:15:26.420 --> 1:15:31.140
 talking to people, decided to move to Austin.

1:15:31.140 --> 1:15:35.980
 Everybody's dreaming big and they have big plans and it's actually, I don't envy the

1:15:35.980 --> 1:15:45.660
 job of an investor of any kind because everybody has big dreams and it's hard to know who exactly,

1:15:45.660 --> 1:15:52.020
 what idea is going to materialize, what team is going to materialize into something great.

1:15:52.020 --> 1:15:56.060
 How do you make those decisions about people, about ideas?

1:15:56.060 --> 1:16:04.780
 Well, if I had any kind of a lattice work on this, it absolutely starts with the people

1:16:04.780 --> 1:16:10.500
 and I think the reason for that is your business plan is going to change, right?

1:16:10.500 --> 1:16:16.020
 There's very few businesses I know of that say, we're going to make a widget in this location

1:16:16.020 --> 1:16:21.300
 and 30 years later, we're successful and we just make a widget and that's what it is.

1:16:21.300 --> 1:16:22.580
 Things happen, right?

1:16:22.580 --> 1:16:31.260
 And today they happen with such velocity that you have to be able to make hard decisions

1:16:31.260 --> 1:16:38.820
 based on imperfect information and are you, how are you going to calculate those answers?

1:16:38.820 --> 1:16:42.020
 How self interested are you going to be?

1:16:42.020 --> 1:16:45.180
 What kind of ethics will you apply?

1:16:45.180 --> 1:16:47.660
 What's your short term versus long term thinking?

1:16:47.660 --> 1:16:53.940
 Are you able to give an honest assessment of a situation?

1:16:53.940 --> 1:16:59.140
 Because the thing that you can count on is problems are going to happen, things you didn't

1:16:59.140 --> 1:17:04.500
 anticipate are going to happen, how pliable are you, right?

1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:13.460
 How much elasticity is there in your ability to be successful and I think it's important

1:17:13.460 --> 1:17:20.100
 when you invest in something that you both see, you understand the roadmap ahead and

1:17:20.100 --> 1:17:21.100
 agree to it, right?

1:17:21.100 --> 1:17:25.180
 It doesn't mean there won't be twists and turns but you're not like, well, wait a minute,

1:17:25.180 --> 1:17:26.420
 what did we do here?

1:17:26.420 --> 1:17:31.300
 This isn't what was in the thing I signed up for.

1:17:31.300 --> 1:17:38.620
 And then I think honesty and communication is a huge thing to me with, you know, I always

1:17:38.620 --> 1:17:44.860
 tell people if bi directionally, if there's something going on, start the conversation

1:17:44.860 --> 1:17:52.260
 with, you know, Lex, we have a problem, okay, now I'm sitting up, you have my full attention,

1:17:52.260 --> 1:17:58.140
 we're going to talk about whatever it is, bad news should travel faster than good news

1:17:58.140 --> 1:18:05.220
 and because it's going to happen, being in business with someone that is going to shoot

1:18:05.220 --> 1:18:09.860
 you straight and sometimes say, I don't know.

1:18:09.860 --> 1:18:12.820
 I don't know what the answer is, I got to go figure it out.

1:18:12.820 --> 1:18:18.340
 That I can process a lot better than, look, I don't want you mad at me or disappointed

1:18:18.340 --> 1:18:25.460
 or I can't handle not having success so we're just going to kick the can and I think especially

1:18:25.460 --> 1:18:29.980
 in today's business environment, that's very, very dangerous.

1:18:29.980 --> 1:18:35.900
 So that's a bad sign, not just because it's good to do, to communicate and be honest,

1:18:35.900 --> 1:18:40.380
 but if they're not willing to do that, then it goes back to the intellectual honesty.

1:18:40.380 --> 1:18:45.860
 They're probably not also able to be brutally honest with themselves when they look in the

1:18:45.860 --> 1:18:48.580
 mirror about the direction of the company.

1:18:48.580 --> 1:18:57.940
 Look, I wasn't there so I don't know, but I think if you unpack many situations that

1:18:57.940 --> 1:19:03.820
 turned out negatively, most of the people, whether you're faking lab results, you have

1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:10.220
 a biotech company, we have everybody's staring at Theranos these days, do I think in a lot

1:19:10.220 --> 1:19:15.940
 of cases you're either the villain, like you started out saying, I'm going to screw my

1:19:15.940 --> 1:19:21.020
 shareholders over and I'm going to be a liar.

1:19:21.020 --> 1:19:23.060
 That isn't my experience.

1:19:23.060 --> 1:19:27.140
 Most things are little incremental moves that you say, we're going to get this right next

1:19:27.140 --> 1:19:29.220
 week, but today we got to make the presentation.

1:19:29.220 --> 1:19:31.860
 So we're going to just tweak things a little bit.

1:19:31.860 --> 1:19:34.540
 That's a slippery slope, right?

1:19:34.540 --> 1:19:41.780
 And so that's why I think from a standpoint of people, you want to go into the foxhole

1:19:41.780 --> 1:19:48.780
 with folks that understand things are going to happen and I'm going to let you know about

1:19:48.780 --> 1:19:53.340
 them and we're going to try to solve them together.

1:19:53.340 --> 1:19:59.660
 And then just in terms of the idea, I always ask like, okay, if this company executed the

1:19:59.660 --> 1:20:03.620
 way, that's the other thing that always cracks me up about financials, whenever somebody

1:20:03.620 --> 1:20:09.900
 pitches you, inevitably they'll say, our projections are really, really conservative.

1:20:09.900 --> 1:20:14.540
 I'm still waiting for somebody to commit and say, look, my projections are wildly optimistic.

1:20:14.540 --> 1:20:22.060
 We'll never hit these numbers, but anyway, it's, you know, if this company did what

1:20:22.060 --> 1:20:25.780
 it says and executes and does it matter, right?

1:20:25.780 --> 1:20:27.740
 Does it move the needle enough?

1:20:27.740 --> 1:20:33.580
 And what are the things that uniquely position this company to be successful and you just

1:20:33.580 --> 1:20:39.340
 have to be able to answer, I think, a number of those questions pretty crisply.

1:20:39.340 --> 1:20:41.740
 But at the end of the day, it's still a big risk.

1:20:41.740 --> 1:20:47.100
 So you're just trying to minimize the risk.

1:20:47.100 --> 1:20:50.980
 Let me jump to another topic.

1:20:50.980 --> 1:20:54.540
 You're an incredible human being that you're involved with this.

1:20:54.540 --> 1:21:00.460
 Your band, Go Sounds, is touring with the Rolling Stones.

1:21:00.460 --> 1:21:03.700
 So before we talk about your band, let me ask about that.

1:21:03.700 --> 1:21:07.140
 What's that like playing with the Rolling Stones?

1:21:07.140 --> 1:21:15.580
 It's surreal, just because they're my favorite band of all time.

1:21:15.580 --> 1:21:19.380
 To me, the greatest rock and roll band, it's not even close of all time.

1:21:19.380 --> 1:21:26.500
 And, you know, to share the same stage, to be on tour and to go out and get that energy

1:21:26.500 --> 1:21:32.980
 from the crowd, you know, and every night and come off stage and later when they go

1:21:32.980 --> 1:21:36.740
 on and you hear that iconic, ladies and gentlemen, the Rolling Stones.

1:21:36.740 --> 1:21:38.900
 And then it's incredible.

1:21:38.900 --> 1:21:45.980
 And you know, what's amazing to me about the band, next year will be their 60th anniversary,

1:21:45.980 --> 1:21:48.500
 60 years.

1:21:48.500 --> 1:21:56.900
 And it's hard to be around anything for that long, but making music and packing stadiums.

1:21:56.900 --> 1:22:00.980
 And what's amazing to me, they can play a two hour set and it's not just that, oh, that's

1:22:00.980 --> 1:22:03.260
 a hit or you recognize it.

1:22:03.260 --> 1:22:09.380
 It's like every song is an anthem.

1:22:09.380 --> 1:22:10.860
 So it's been amazing.

1:22:10.860 --> 1:22:12.980
 We got to play with them in 2019.

1:22:12.980 --> 1:22:19.820
 And when they ask us to do this again, it's just an absolute privilege.

1:22:19.820 --> 1:22:21.740
 I asked you the soft line.

1:22:21.740 --> 1:22:25.020
 So I know you are a kind of rock star.

1:22:25.020 --> 1:22:30.580
 But just me, maybe I'm projecting, but do you get nervous?

1:22:30.580 --> 1:22:33.860
 Such a large audience with the Rolling Stones.

1:22:33.860 --> 1:22:35.580
 It feels like there would be a lot of pressure.

1:22:35.580 --> 1:22:36.580
 Yeah.

1:22:36.580 --> 1:22:39.500
 I mean, you definitely don't want to screw it up.

1:22:39.500 --> 1:22:45.860
 I think the band, our band, you know, is tight knit and all that stuff.

1:22:45.860 --> 1:22:52.260
 And I think that you, the individual nervousness dissipates when you go out as a group and

1:22:52.260 --> 1:22:58.860
 you're making music together and you sort of, okay, we're all in this and you know, we're

1:22:58.860 --> 1:22:59.860
 doing a thing.

1:22:59.860 --> 1:23:06.660
 And by even in sports, I always look at individual events like ice skating or, you know, anything

1:23:06.660 --> 1:23:09.220
 where it's just you out there alone.

1:23:09.220 --> 1:23:13.100
 And that's different than being with a team and nerve wracking.

1:23:13.100 --> 1:23:18.980
 So I'm sure if it was me with an acoustic guitar just going out, it would feel different.

1:23:18.980 --> 1:23:25.100
 But absolutely, you get the right kind of butterflies, I would call it.

1:23:25.100 --> 1:23:32.420
 And just the energy of playing music and having it be this relationship and you, and look,

1:23:32.420 --> 1:23:33.420
 I get it.

1:23:33.420 --> 1:23:38.860
 I've been to a ton of concerts where I'm like, look, can we just get to the band, please?

1:23:38.860 --> 1:23:44.060
 But what's been great is just an amazing reception.

1:23:44.060 --> 1:23:49.940
 And we have this guy named Traination as the lead singer is just incredibly talented.

1:23:49.940 --> 1:23:56.620
 I mean, he's just not only an amazing voice, but just has that charismatic thing.

1:23:56.620 --> 1:23:57.620
 Yeah.

1:23:57.620 --> 1:23:58.620
 He's great.

1:23:58.620 --> 1:23:59.620
 It's fun.

1:23:59.620 --> 1:24:02.940
 What's it feel like to play in front of a huge audience?

1:24:02.940 --> 1:24:10.700
 What's, as a guitarist, are you lost in the music, like you almost don't feel the audience?

1:24:10.700 --> 1:24:12.420
 Does it add extra energy?

1:24:12.420 --> 1:24:14.740
 Does it add extra anxiety?

1:24:14.740 --> 1:24:17.420
 What does it make, what's it feel like?

1:24:17.420 --> 1:24:22.700
 You know, stadiums are interesting just because it's so big and cavernous.

1:24:22.700 --> 1:24:24.700
 And because, you know, you want to protect your ears.

1:24:24.700 --> 1:24:30.820
 So we use an in ear system so that you are a little disconnected from the crowd because

1:24:30.820 --> 1:24:35.500
 if you're playing that loud and you're standing in front of your amps without ear protection,

1:24:35.500 --> 1:24:36.500
 that's bad.

1:24:36.500 --> 1:24:38.340
 How are you monitoring the sound?

1:24:38.340 --> 1:24:41.860
 The in ear stuff, is that producing sound or is it strictly earplugs?

1:24:41.860 --> 1:24:43.260
 No, it's producing the sound.

1:24:43.260 --> 1:24:48.860
 So like putting ear pods in and listening to a song and you're playing to it, right?

1:24:48.860 --> 1:24:54.940
 It's just us playing, but it protects your ears.

1:24:54.940 --> 1:25:01.460
 But the energy from the crowd, when they get going and get into it, which knock on wood

1:25:01.460 --> 1:25:05.980
 so far has been amazing, there's nothing like it.

1:25:05.980 --> 1:25:16.180
 I mean, it's just this bi directional thing that happens and music was kind of, music

1:25:16.180 --> 1:25:24.140
 and sports were, you know, kind of my first loves and it's, yeah, it's very difficult

1:25:24.140 --> 1:25:31.940
 to describe, I think, accurately because it's like no other feeling.

1:25:31.940 --> 1:25:38.860
 Really how is it different than playing in a garage with the band by yourself practicing?

1:25:38.860 --> 1:25:46.220
 Is it, do you feel like you're creating something different when you're, when you're, when you

1:25:46.220 --> 1:25:52.060
 got the guitar and the amp and just the sound dissipating out into and everybody's listening?

1:25:52.060 --> 1:25:57.340
 Yeah, it's, listen, the first time we did it and there's nobody in the stadium, first

1:25:57.340 --> 1:26:04.020
 time I ever played in the stadium and I'm just like, I'm out there in front and just

1:26:04.020 --> 1:26:09.140
 hitting different chords and playing different licks and I'm like, it's like I want a contest

1:26:09.140 --> 1:26:12.020
 and I get to do this.

1:26:12.020 --> 1:26:16.340
 But you know, what's different about it in each venue is different.

1:26:16.340 --> 1:26:22.740
 So if you, if you, we went on the road with ZZ Top a few years ago, which was incredible.

1:26:22.740 --> 1:26:29.380
 Billy Gibbons, he's a Texan, incredible person and guitar player, but you know, when you're

1:26:29.380 --> 1:26:34.740
 playing in like five to 7,000 seats, it's really, I mean, it's, you know, you're right

1:26:34.740 --> 1:26:37.460
 there with them, with the crowd.

1:26:37.460 --> 1:26:44.380
 And then when you play in an arena for, we toured with Bob Seeger on his last tour, which

1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:47.180
 was cool, played some shows with him.

1:26:47.180 --> 1:26:53.300
 And again, the arena, like they're all kind of packed on top of you and it's super loud,

1:26:53.300 --> 1:26:54.300
 which was cool.

1:26:54.300 --> 1:27:03.740
 I mean, the crowd is, stadiums is a completely different animal and it's, it's just a completely

1:27:03.740 --> 1:27:04.900
 different experience.

1:27:04.900 --> 1:27:08.900
 Do you enjoy it versus like a smaller room?

1:27:08.900 --> 1:27:09.900
 Yeah.

1:27:09.900 --> 1:27:16.500
 What's, as a guitarist, as a musician, what's your favorite like room to play of the size?

1:27:16.500 --> 1:27:24.860
 Any room that'll have me, look, I think arenas are the perfect blend, if I had to say, because

1:27:24.860 --> 1:27:32.220
 it's loud and you know, 20, 30,000 people, but like right up, right up on you, a stadium.

1:27:32.220 --> 1:27:38.900
 Look, playing the stadiums with, with the Rolling Stones is just, is going to go on

1:27:38.900 --> 1:27:43.740
 the headmark or somewhere is one of the more, you know, I say this and I really mean it.

1:27:43.740 --> 1:27:51.740
 My life is like a punk episode that just hasn't, no one's burst in yet, but yeah, it's, it's

1:27:51.740 --> 1:27:53.380
 as cool as you think it is.

1:27:53.380 --> 1:27:56.380
 So 60 years, how do you think Mick Jagger still got it?

1:27:56.380 --> 1:27:59.540
 Well, how do you, you know, how do you explain it?

1:27:59.540 --> 1:28:00.540
 I got to tell you so.

1:28:00.540 --> 1:28:07.340
 I mean, the funny thing is, whatever, wherever there is excellence, people want to know how

1:28:07.340 --> 1:28:08.340
 did you do it?

1:28:08.340 --> 1:28:09.340
 Yeah.

1:28:09.340 --> 1:28:10.340
 Right now.

1:28:10.340 --> 1:28:16.900
 It's a secret, not only is Mick Jagger, and I think the songs that Keith Richards and

1:28:16.900 --> 1:28:23.020
 Mick Jagger wrote together, if you go back and listen to the lyrics, it's just incredibly

1:28:23.020 --> 1:28:32.500
 poignant and I'm just a huge Stones fan, so, but he works out like a maniac, right?

1:28:32.500 --> 1:28:38.180
 And it's, it's that 10,000 hours thing and it's that, hey, maybe I don't feel my best

1:28:38.180 --> 1:28:45.620
 today, but I'm going to get up and do my routine and work out so that, you know, at his age,

1:28:45.620 --> 1:28:52.700
 which, you know, I mean, you can look at people at different ages chronologically that are,

1:28:52.700 --> 1:28:57.940
 you know, maybe we're both at this age, but I'm a lot older than you are advice versa.

1:28:57.940 --> 1:29:04.180
 And he just, I think it's the combination of raw talent and the ability and he's, he's

1:29:04.180 --> 1:29:05.180
 very smart.

1:29:05.180 --> 1:29:06.180
 Right?

1:29:06.180 --> 1:29:11.500
 I think he's understands how to have interaction with the crowd and hold them in the palm of

1:29:11.500 --> 1:29:13.940
 his hand and be an entertainer.

1:29:13.940 --> 1:29:20.020
 But then on top of that, the reason he can at this age run around stadiums and be just

1:29:20.020 --> 1:29:22.780
 as energetic as he puts the work in.

1:29:22.780 --> 1:29:27.060
 And that's one thing, step that I think a lot of people miss sometimes where they want

1:29:27.060 --> 1:29:28.060
 that magic trick.

1:29:28.060 --> 1:29:30.620
 They want to know what's the shortcut.

1:29:30.620 --> 1:29:32.860
 Most of the time, the answer is there's no shortcut.

1:29:32.860 --> 1:29:33.860
 Yeah.

1:29:33.860 --> 1:29:39.380
 You have to work hard on the way there and work hard to stay on top.

1:29:39.380 --> 1:29:40.380
 That's it.

1:29:40.380 --> 1:29:45.300
 And sometimes it's not even like work hard is just like, it's like be a professional,

1:29:45.300 --> 1:29:50.580
 which that involves like in his case at his age with the amount of stuff you have to do

1:29:50.580 --> 1:29:58.260
 on stage and the way he does it for two hours, you have, this is a professional athlete, a

1:29:58.260 --> 1:30:04.140
 professional athlete that has to do things that are probably designed for 20 year olds

1:30:04.140 --> 1:30:07.900
 and 30 year olds has to do it at an older age, which means like, what do you have to

1:30:07.900 --> 1:30:08.900
 do?

1:30:08.900 --> 1:30:12.540
 Well, you have to probably, he probably has like a whole physical routine he has to do.

1:30:12.540 --> 1:30:13.900
 Diet the whole thing.

1:30:13.900 --> 1:30:14.900
 And it's hard.

1:30:14.900 --> 1:30:20.940
 Look, if you want to do great things, you probably have to do hard things to get there.

1:30:20.940 --> 1:30:26.940
 I'm not going to make you pick, just stick on the stones for one more minute.

1:30:26.940 --> 1:30:36.220
 But what are some great Rolling Stones songs that were impactful to you, lyrically, musically,

1:30:36.220 --> 1:30:44.140
 maybe something you like playing like air guitar or I don't know.

1:30:44.140 --> 1:30:45.140
 Probably my favorites.

1:30:45.140 --> 1:30:47.780
 I love sympathy for the devil.

1:30:47.780 --> 1:30:50.940
 It's a very, I don't know, sort of Faustian.

1:30:50.940 --> 1:30:52.340
 I love the lyrics.

1:30:52.340 --> 1:30:58.980
 I love how the almost a voodoo beat just kind of builds throughout the song.

1:30:58.980 --> 1:31:00.420
 That's always been one of my favorites.

1:31:00.420 --> 1:31:03.180
 So in that song, he never mentions devil, does he?

1:31:03.180 --> 1:31:10.580
 No, wait, sorry, like, you know, my name, there's like a flirtation going on in the

1:31:10.580 --> 1:31:11.580
 lyrics.

1:31:11.580 --> 1:31:12.580
 It's kind of interesting.

1:31:12.580 --> 1:31:17.060
 Yeah, it's, here's all the trouble I've caused along the way with you humans.

1:31:17.060 --> 1:31:19.300
 And I just think it's really, really great.

1:31:19.300 --> 1:31:20.740
 Musically builds really nicely.

1:31:20.740 --> 1:31:21.740
 Yeah.

1:31:21.740 --> 1:31:24.220
 It's like both fun and dark.

1:31:24.220 --> 1:31:29.220
 It's cool.

1:31:29.220 --> 1:31:32.460
 There's a playful nature to it.

1:31:32.460 --> 1:31:33.980
 That's very stones.

1:31:33.980 --> 1:31:38.500
 Only they can pull it off because it's like playful, but it's also like dark and cool.

1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:39.500
 Dangerous.

1:31:39.500 --> 1:31:40.500
 Dangerous, dangerous.

1:31:40.500 --> 1:31:41.500
 Yeah.

1:31:41.500 --> 1:31:42.500
 And Gimme Shelter.

1:31:42.500 --> 1:31:43.500
 Gimme Shelter.

1:31:43.500 --> 1:31:49.260
 It's just, you know, and to this day, when I listen to the studio version and Mary Clayton

1:31:49.260 --> 1:31:58.780
 just comes on and sings that epic, iconic part and there's a documentary that was done

1:31:58.780 --> 1:32:07.380
 about backup singers, phenomenal, and it tells the story of that moment and that song with

1:32:07.380 --> 1:32:14.220
 Mary Clayton and it's just her voice and the way it unfolded, they got her out of bed

1:32:14.220 --> 1:32:19.020
 at like 10 o clock at night in LA and she's like the Rolling Stones and went in and just

1:32:19.020 --> 1:32:20.860
 killed it.

1:32:20.860 --> 1:32:23.100
 And I can't sing at all.

1:32:23.100 --> 1:32:26.940
 I'm by ordinance, not around a microphone.

1:32:26.940 --> 1:32:33.140
 So I'm always in awe when someone can sing like that.

1:32:33.140 --> 1:32:41.180
 But you know, those are some of my favorite Rolling Stones songs and Paint It Black is

1:32:41.180 --> 1:32:42.180
 awesome.

1:32:42.180 --> 1:32:43.180
 I mean, I could go on.

1:32:43.180 --> 1:32:44.180
 Yeah, Paint It Black is great.

1:32:44.180 --> 1:32:45.940
 But again, a song that builds is badass.

1:32:45.940 --> 1:32:47.860
 I mean, it defines the whole generation.

1:32:47.860 --> 1:32:49.700
 What made you pick up a guitar?

1:32:49.700 --> 1:32:52.700
 What made you fall in love with the guitar?

1:32:52.700 --> 1:32:55.020
 It's just the coolest instrument, right?

1:32:55.020 --> 1:33:01.580
 I mean, when you watched back then, you know, and I was kind of an old soul.

1:33:01.580 --> 1:33:10.500
 I was listening at a fairly young age to Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, Lightning Hopkins,

1:33:10.500 --> 1:33:15.020
 B.B. King and just the soulfulness.

1:33:15.020 --> 1:33:16.020
 Thrills gone.

1:33:16.020 --> 1:33:17.020
 Oh my God.

1:33:17.020 --> 1:33:24.140
 I mean, B.B. plays five notes and just kills it in the emotion that it evokes.

1:33:24.140 --> 1:33:29.700
 So I just was just an awe of the instrument.

1:33:29.700 --> 1:33:36.700
 And you know, I also, there's always somebody around who's a musician that just picks the

1:33:36.700 --> 1:33:39.220
 instrument up and can play, right?

1:33:39.220 --> 1:33:44.060
 And they're just so talented at it, and they can just listen to a record and play it.

1:33:44.060 --> 1:33:45.740
 That was never me.

1:33:45.740 --> 1:33:47.900
 I never took formal lessons.

1:33:47.900 --> 1:33:54.340
 I had to grind, you know, to just make it sound like I wanted it to sound.

1:33:54.340 --> 1:33:58.060
 So both technically and ear, everything was hard work.

1:33:58.060 --> 1:33:59.060
 Yeah.

1:33:59.060 --> 1:34:04.500
 I mean, I could hear it and what they call, you know, you play.

1:34:04.500 --> 1:34:13.540
 So by right hand, the rhythm side of it is, that's probably if I have anything, my strength.

1:34:13.540 --> 1:34:20.900
 But there's something pretty amazing that happens when you get together with other people and

1:34:20.900 --> 1:34:28.100
 play a song in that moment where it hits the pocket and you all kind of know it.

1:34:28.100 --> 1:34:31.460
 And it's just such a cool feeling.

1:34:31.460 --> 1:34:36.700
 And it was interesting growing up because I was, again, I always had a eclectic interest.

1:34:36.700 --> 1:34:41.020
 So I loved math and physics and science, so I had those friends and I was an athlete

1:34:41.020 --> 1:34:46.180
 and played football and baseball and basketball, so I had my jock friends.

1:34:46.180 --> 1:34:52.020
 And then I had my music friends and so it was just kind of that.

1:34:52.020 --> 1:35:01.720
 And so when I was still living in Los Angeles and had legendary, I just missed playing.

1:35:01.720 --> 1:35:08.700
 And so I put this band together and called it the Ghost Towns because, again, huge Robert

1:35:08.700 --> 1:35:15.820
 Johnson fan and that legend of Robert Johnson selling his soul at the Crossroads in exchange

1:35:15.820 --> 1:35:16.820
 for his musical talent.

1:35:16.820 --> 1:35:18.900
 You guys have that in one of the videos?

1:35:18.900 --> 1:35:19.900
 Yeah.

1:35:19.900 --> 1:35:20.900
 Such a cool video.

1:35:20.900 --> 1:35:21.900
 Exactly.

1:35:21.900 --> 1:35:28.460
 And I just thought that's such cool lore and I just love the blues.

1:35:28.460 --> 1:35:33.580
 So Robert Johnson would often would talk about Hellhounds on his trail.

1:35:33.580 --> 1:35:37.660
 And so I always just thought, what about Ghost Towns?

1:35:37.660 --> 1:35:44.020
 So I wish it were a more clever, deeper story, but that's about it for the name.

1:35:44.020 --> 1:35:45.020
 That's pretty deep.

1:35:45.020 --> 1:35:46.020
 Robert Johnson is incredible.

1:35:46.020 --> 1:35:51.020
 But you also talk about that you connect to the storytelling of blues.

1:35:51.020 --> 1:35:54.740
 So what makes a good story in a song?

1:35:54.740 --> 1:35:57.900
 What aspects of storytelling connects with you in songs?

1:35:57.900 --> 1:35:59.100
 So I'm a big lyrics guy too.

1:35:59.100 --> 1:36:08.380
 I love deep lyric people like Tom Waits and people that are like Leonard Cohen, even Bob

1:36:08.380 --> 1:36:12.940
 Dillon, that are obviously as poetry.

1:36:12.940 --> 1:36:15.700
 And then there's some people like The Rolling Stones there.

1:36:15.700 --> 1:36:21.100
 It's like seemingly simpler, but it's still so much more to it.

1:36:21.100 --> 1:36:23.780
 It's like less is often more.

1:36:23.780 --> 1:36:25.940
 It still tells a strong story.

1:36:25.940 --> 1:36:31.220
 And there's certain people and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards are in this boat, Billy

1:36:31.220 --> 1:36:32.940
 Gibbons is in this boat.

1:36:32.940 --> 1:36:39.420
 They just say things in a certain way that are just cool.

1:36:39.420 --> 1:36:48.140
 And so I write our music and lyrics, I have to tell a story, I have to know the characters

1:36:48.140 --> 1:36:49.140
 in the song.

1:36:49.140 --> 1:36:53.420
 I'm not good at just writing some rhymes and having it match up to the right key and the

1:36:53.420 --> 1:36:54.740
 right music.

1:36:54.740 --> 1:36:59.300
 I have to understand like, that's just me.

1:36:59.300 --> 1:37:04.700
 And so I think that, look, if you have three or four minutes to tell a story, you have

1:37:04.700 --> 1:37:09.620
 to be more efficient with your use of language.

1:37:09.620 --> 1:37:15.580
 And you have to understand what you're building to, if anything, and evoke emotion.

1:37:15.580 --> 1:37:22.300
 And hopefully for those three minutes, get the listener to understand not only the point

1:37:22.300 --> 1:37:28.420
 of the song, but where you're coming from and to make you feel a certain way.

1:37:28.420 --> 1:37:33.060
 There's a song that the audience has seemed to like a lot on the new album called Good

1:37:33.060 --> 1:37:34.460
 Old Days.

1:37:34.460 --> 1:37:41.860
 And I wrote that because especially during COVID and reflecting on what normalcy looks

1:37:41.860 --> 1:37:50.460
 like and what happens when you're cut off, I just was kind of taken with this idea of

1:37:50.460 --> 1:37:57.220
 that when you sit around and reminisce with friends, oftentimes, it's not just like some

1:37:57.220 --> 1:37:59.540
 big event happened.

1:37:59.540 --> 1:38:05.460
 It's remember that summer, we'd go up to the lake all the time and it's who you were with.

1:38:05.460 --> 1:38:09.700
 And at the time, it probably seemed pretty pedestrian, right?

1:38:09.700 --> 1:38:12.340
 Just seemed like kind of a normal day.

1:38:12.340 --> 1:38:14.140
 But it was the company you were keeping.

1:38:14.140 --> 1:38:15.820
 It was the time in your life.

1:38:15.820 --> 1:38:18.060
 It was whatever it was.

1:38:18.060 --> 1:38:23.340
 And I just kind of struck me that right now, we're doing stuff that you're going to reminisce

1:38:23.340 --> 1:38:29.220
 about later that seems kind of ordinary to be like, man, that was such a great time.

1:38:29.220 --> 1:38:31.660
 So the idea is be in the moment and all that stuff.

1:38:31.660 --> 1:38:39.140
 But these are the good old days and enjoy it and soak it in and kind of be present for

1:38:39.140 --> 1:38:40.140
 it.

1:38:40.140 --> 1:38:41.140
 Yeah.

1:38:41.140 --> 1:38:44.460
 It's a great perspective to take on the present because we are in the thing that we'll remember.

1:38:44.460 --> 1:38:46.100
 We're living through the thing we'll remember.

1:38:46.100 --> 1:38:53.180
 And sometimes the things we'll remember is the simple stuff, the little stuff.

1:38:53.180 --> 1:39:00.260
 Instead of Keith Richards, who is the greatest ridiculous question, but just indulge me?

1:39:00.260 --> 1:39:04.860
 Who is the greatest blues guitarist of all time, rock guitarist of all time?

1:39:04.860 --> 1:39:08.740
 Well, you got a little bit of a hybrid with Jimi Hendrix, right?

1:39:08.740 --> 1:39:11.500
 Because he played the blues and he played rock and roll.

1:39:11.500 --> 1:39:18.260
 So I think most guitarists would say Jimi Hendrix is pretty ridiculous.

1:39:18.260 --> 1:39:21.540
 That probably for me, I'm a huge, huge, huge Hendrix fan to play.

1:39:21.540 --> 1:39:27.260
 I mean, even to this day, I don't care, technology, pedals, whatever.

1:39:27.260 --> 1:39:32.540
 He just somehow fused with the instrument.

1:39:32.540 --> 1:39:36.860
 I can't be sitting here in Austin, Texas without mentioning one of the great guitar

1:39:36.860 --> 1:39:40.060
 players of all time in Stevie Ray Vaughan.

1:39:40.060 --> 1:39:42.220
 See, that's how I know you're like a rock star.

1:39:42.220 --> 1:39:43.820
 You're sucking up to the audience.

1:39:43.820 --> 1:39:48.340
 No, but you're the listeners all over the place.

1:39:48.340 --> 1:39:55.540
 Stevie Ray Vaughan is another one of those just blows me away.

1:39:55.540 --> 1:40:06.300
 And then with the older guys, BB King, Hubert Sumlin, Clapton, I saw him on his last tour

1:40:06.300 --> 1:40:14.740
 and just walked out on my just like unbelievable how he still sounds.

1:40:14.740 --> 1:40:19.020
 And both electric and acoustic, just so strange.

1:40:19.020 --> 1:40:21.020
 Absolute master.

1:40:21.020 --> 1:40:27.420
 And the greatest storyteller, Mr. Bob Seeger, that's an interesting one.

1:40:27.420 --> 1:40:31.620
 He almost doesn't get enough credit, I feel like, for how great he is.

1:40:31.620 --> 1:40:33.420
 Obviously, he's super famous, but.

1:40:33.420 --> 1:40:36.500
 No, he's in his voice.

1:40:36.500 --> 1:40:42.500
 I also, I had the privilege of getting friendly with John Fogarty, you know, John Fogarty

1:40:42.500 --> 1:40:43.500
 and CCR fame.

1:40:43.500 --> 1:40:48.380
 And he's another one that's just the way he phrases things.

1:40:48.380 --> 1:40:54.860
 And you just look at the catalog of stuff he wrote, amazing talent.

1:40:54.860 --> 1:41:03.060
 I read Bruce Springsteen's book and was, I'm a fan, but after reading the book, it was

1:41:03.060 --> 1:41:10.820
 really, you go back and listen to his lyrics and the way he pours himself out is pretty

1:41:10.820 --> 1:41:13.620
 incredible.

1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:19.780
 And then again, with the old blues guys, I just think the emotion they could get out

1:41:19.780 --> 1:41:23.180
 of playing like the sustain on the one, right?

1:41:23.180 --> 1:41:27.220
 Just playing the same rhythm, John Lee Hooker.

1:41:27.220 --> 1:41:36.420
 You listen to Manish Boy by Muddy Waters and it's just, there's something so, it just

1:41:36.420 --> 1:41:41.180
 draws me in every time and the emotion they're able to get out of things.

1:41:41.180 --> 1:41:44.180
 And I'm also a huge Chuck Berry fan.

1:41:44.180 --> 1:41:48.940
 I just think that sound is, I love it.

1:41:48.940 --> 1:41:51.060
 Do you know how to play Johnny Be Good?

1:41:51.060 --> 1:41:52.060
 I do.

1:41:52.060 --> 1:41:53.060
 I do.

1:41:53.060 --> 1:41:54.060
 Yeah.

1:41:54.060 --> 1:41:55.060
 That's good.

1:41:55.060 --> 1:42:01.820
 Maybe, you know, one of the great moments, at least of my childhood, was back to the

1:42:01.820 --> 1:42:09.380
 future and watching Michael J. Fox plug in and then at the end, play at the dance to

1:42:09.380 --> 1:42:11.380
 save his parents with Johnny Be Good.

1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:12.380
 Pretty awesome.

1:42:12.380 --> 1:42:13.380
 Yeah.

1:42:13.380 --> 1:42:14.820
 The guitar is so much more than a musical instrument.

1:42:14.820 --> 1:42:21.900
 It feels like, it's like the, in the 20th century, it's like the car, like it defines

1:42:21.900 --> 1:42:27.420
 so much of Hollywood, so much of a generation of what it means to be, I don't know, what

1:42:27.420 --> 1:42:32.460
 it means to be a man, what it means to be a human in America, it's, it's fascinating.

1:42:32.460 --> 1:42:39.900
 It's emblematic to me of a certain type of music and that, that's, I made a documentary

1:42:39.900 --> 1:42:43.900
 years ago called, It Might Get Loud with Jimi Page, The Edge.

1:42:43.900 --> 1:42:45.420
 I highly recommend it.

1:42:45.420 --> 1:42:46.540
 Everybody watch that documentary.

1:42:46.540 --> 1:42:48.740
 It's an incredible celebration of the guitar.

1:42:48.740 --> 1:42:49.740
 Yeah.

1:42:49.740 --> 1:42:53.580
 It says Jimi Page, Jack White from White Stripes.

1:42:53.580 --> 1:42:54.580
 The Edge.

1:42:54.580 --> 1:42:56.060
 And The Edge from U2.

1:42:56.060 --> 1:42:57.060
 Okay.

1:42:57.060 --> 1:42:58.060
 All right.

1:42:58.060 --> 1:43:01.900
 Well, now you have to tell the story of that one because how the heck did that all come

1:43:01.900 --> 1:43:02.900
 together?

1:43:02.900 --> 1:43:03.900
 Because it's so fascinating.

1:43:03.900 --> 1:43:10.420
 Such different musicians all coming together, talking about their story, talking about how

1:43:10.420 --> 1:43:15.340
 they approach the music and also playing together a little bit in this casual kind of setting.

1:43:15.340 --> 1:43:21.020
 Well, look, I, one day I came downstairs and I, the Rolling Stone magazine is sitting there

1:43:21.020 --> 1:43:26.060
 and it was the 50th, it was the 50 top guitarists of all time, their list.

1:43:26.060 --> 1:43:30.940
 And then I had some other financial report with video games and the top video game at

1:43:30.940 --> 1:43:32.940
 the time was Guitar Hero, right?

1:43:32.940 --> 1:43:37.580
 And then there was a third thing, I can't recall it, but I just, and I said to myself,

1:43:37.580 --> 1:43:44.580
 what is it about the guitar that is so central to the rock and roll, whatever you want to

1:43:44.580 --> 1:43:45.580
 call it?

1:43:45.580 --> 1:43:48.580
 Like, why is that the symbol?

1:43:48.580 --> 1:43:54.540
 And I said to myself, I want to ask Jimi Page why he picked up the guitar because he's

1:43:54.540 --> 1:43:56.500
 Jimi Page, right?

1:43:56.500 --> 1:44:02.700
 And so I called a friend of mine, Davis Guggenheim, who had directed Inconvenient Truth, and I

1:44:02.700 --> 1:44:06.900
 think still is, but at the time was the biggest documentary ever.

1:44:06.900 --> 1:44:11.500
 And I called Davis and I said, look, I have this idea, I want to make this movie about

1:44:11.500 --> 1:44:16.980
 the guitar, about different eras and styles and whatever, but I've never made a documentary.

1:44:16.980 --> 1:44:18.180
 I don't know how to do that.

1:44:18.180 --> 1:44:25.900
 I was just looking for advice, and thankfully, because he's one of the best documentarians

1:44:25.900 --> 1:44:29.500
 ever, Davis is like, you know what, I can't get this out of my head.

1:44:29.500 --> 1:44:32.620
 I'll direct it, which was amazing.

1:44:32.620 --> 1:44:38.700
 And we wrote three names down that represented different eras and different styles.

1:44:38.700 --> 1:44:45.100
 Rarely do you get, you know, you go three for three, but it was those three guys.

1:44:45.100 --> 1:44:53.660
 And it was just such an incredible experience to sit there and get to know Jimi Page, you

1:44:53.660 --> 1:44:54.660
 know?

1:44:54.660 --> 1:44:57.580
 I mean, it was like, and he was, it was like Gandalf, man.

1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:01.340
 He was like, always Jimi Page.

1:45:01.340 --> 1:45:02.340
 Yeah.

1:45:02.340 --> 1:45:07.460
 And that was so cool to see him, Gandalf was, there's like a wisdom, there's a calmness

1:45:07.460 --> 1:45:12.700
 to him compared to like the restlessness of Jack White.

1:45:12.700 --> 1:45:16.860
 Like, I mean, that combination was just fascinating.

1:45:16.860 --> 1:45:20.140
 It was one of the coolest experiences ever.

1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:25.260
 And one of the things, there was a moment where Jimi, he was going through his guitar

1:45:25.260 --> 1:45:29.540
 case and he had the double neck from stairway to heaven and he handed it to me.

1:45:29.540 --> 1:45:32.060
 And I was like, mm hmm.

1:45:32.060 --> 1:45:37.380
 I mean, it's like somebody handing you X caliber or something.

1:45:37.380 --> 1:45:38.380
 Amazing experience.

1:45:38.380 --> 1:45:42.820
 You know, on the edge, one of the kindest human beings you'll ever meet in your life,

1:45:42.820 --> 1:45:45.340
 just an amazing person.

1:45:45.340 --> 1:45:49.900
 And I think he hit it right on the head with Jack is he's got that, that energy, you know,

1:45:49.900 --> 1:45:52.420
 and constantly pushing himself.

1:45:52.420 --> 1:45:57.060
 But it's hard to believe it's been, I think 10 or 11 or maybe even 12 years since it came

1:45:57.060 --> 1:45:58.060
 out.

1:45:58.060 --> 1:46:03.060
 But after watching it, I realized like how much it was needed.

1:46:03.060 --> 1:46:06.780
 And I was almost surprised it didn't already exist.

1:46:06.780 --> 1:46:13.220
 It was like, yeah, the guitar wasn't quite celebrated like explicitly.

1:46:13.220 --> 1:46:15.780
 We almost didn't acknowledge it.

1:46:15.780 --> 1:46:17.740
 How important it was culturally.

1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:18.740
 It's kind of amazing.

1:46:18.740 --> 1:46:23.500
 And the way it closed from the song, the weight, it was called the weight by the band.

1:46:23.500 --> 1:46:24.500
 Yeah.

1:46:24.500 --> 1:46:25.500
 Yeah.

1:46:25.500 --> 1:46:26.500
 That's because they didn't want to go home.

1:46:26.500 --> 1:46:27.500
 Yeah.

1:46:27.500 --> 1:46:31.500
 We were shooting on a Warner Brothers sound stage for three days when we called it the

1:46:31.500 --> 1:46:34.620
 summit where the three of them came together.

1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:40.140
 And the two things I'll never forget is when Jimmy starts to play the riff from whole lot

1:46:40.140 --> 1:46:42.140
 of love.

1:46:42.140 --> 1:46:50.140
 Edge and Jack cease to be rock, you know, rock gods or whatever and had the same 15 year

1:46:50.140 --> 1:46:53.460
 old kid feeling that I did, you could see in their face.

1:46:53.460 --> 1:46:55.700
 And then at the end, they're like, Hey, can we play?

1:46:55.700 --> 1:46:57.140
 We just want to, we don't want to go.

1:46:57.140 --> 1:46:59.700
 Can we just play something acoustically?

1:46:59.700 --> 1:47:01.020
 So we printed out the lyrics.

1:47:01.020 --> 1:47:02.020
 That's what they wanted to play.

1:47:02.020 --> 1:47:09.580
 And they just sat there and sat on those couches and just such a good way and yeah, incredible.

1:47:09.580 --> 1:47:16.380
 What's your guitar rig set up like you, you also, you have a few guitars first, let's,

1:47:16.380 --> 1:47:17.620
 let's just put on the line.

1:47:17.620 --> 1:47:21.380
 So what's better, Les Paul or Strat?

1:47:21.380 --> 1:47:25.780
 Well, I'm not going to get into what's, what's better because I'm sure that'll start a flood

1:47:25.780 --> 1:47:27.780
 of whatever for me.

1:47:27.780 --> 1:47:29.100
 I'm going to say it's Strat.

1:47:29.100 --> 1:47:30.100
 All right.

1:47:30.100 --> 1:47:34.820
 I'm going to put out the, my main instruments is a Les Paul.

1:47:34.820 --> 1:47:35.820
 But I, okay, okay.

1:47:35.820 --> 1:47:36.820
 Let me just put on the table.

1:47:36.820 --> 1:47:41.580
 I'm speaking as somebody who literally, I don't think I ever actually strummed a chord

1:47:41.580 --> 1:47:42.580
 on the Les Paul.

1:47:42.580 --> 1:47:44.660
 So I've been, maybe I'm uninitiated.

1:47:44.660 --> 1:47:45.660
 Exactly.

1:47:45.660 --> 1:47:50.380
 So I don't, I don't speak from experience, but I, it's probably because of Hendricks

1:47:50.380 --> 1:47:55.260
 was so deeply influenced by Hendricks that I just kind of following his footsteps and

1:47:55.260 --> 1:47:56.700
 clapped and so on.

1:47:56.700 --> 1:48:02.740
 The amazing thing to me is if you look back at Leo Fender and what the Gibson Guitar Company

1:48:02.740 --> 1:48:09.260
 and Les Paul did in the fifties, those are still the shapes and the perfect thing today.

1:48:09.260 --> 1:48:10.260
 Right?

1:48:10.260 --> 1:48:14.340
 The Strat and the Telecaster and the Les Paul and it's, they got it right.

1:48:14.340 --> 1:48:15.780
 Way back, way back then.

1:48:15.780 --> 1:48:21.420
 So I have my main guitar, you got to name your guitar.

1:48:21.420 --> 1:48:29.300
 So my main guitar is named Hazel and it's a 59 Les Paul and there's something magical

1:48:29.300 --> 1:48:37.060
 in that year, like a Strativarius and they're just, there's something different about them.

1:48:37.060 --> 1:48:46.660
 So I play that and then I play it through sort of my main rigs, either a 59 Fender twin

1:48:46.660 --> 1:48:54.500
 or a 65 Marshall and then when we're on the road now, because when you use older vintage

1:48:54.500 --> 1:48:58.900
 stuff, you just got to be super careful with the tubes and everything, it has to be reliable.

1:48:58.900 --> 1:49:03.740
 So very nicely, the guys from Two Rock sent me some of their amps and they're really,

1:49:03.740 --> 1:49:07.540
 because I don't use any new stuff, but the Two Rock stuff is pretty great.

1:49:07.540 --> 1:49:08.540
 So that's actually what I'm using.

1:49:08.540 --> 1:49:09.540
 Oh, it gets close.

1:49:09.540 --> 1:49:11.780
 It gets close to the sound that you like with the Marshall.

1:49:11.780 --> 1:49:12.780
 Yeah.

1:49:12.780 --> 1:49:13.780
 Yeah.

1:49:13.780 --> 1:49:14.780
 It's new and reliable.

1:49:14.780 --> 1:49:15.780
 So that's what I'm using on the road right now.

1:49:15.780 --> 1:49:16.780
 Do people use emulation?

1:49:16.780 --> 1:49:19.300
 Do they use software or is it still?

1:49:19.300 --> 1:49:20.300
 They do.

1:49:20.300 --> 1:49:21.300
 I personally don't.

1:49:21.300 --> 1:49:23.700
 I go, I don't have many pedals.

1:49:23.700 --> 1:49:28.820
 I use a Klon, an old vintage Klon straight into the amp and that's it.

1:49:28.820 --> 1:49:30.500
 It's as old school as possible.

1:49:30.500 --> 1:49:31.500
 Yeah.

1:49:31.500 --> 1:49:34.500
 Is there other cool guitars you have that kind of stand out?

1:49:34.500 --> 1:49:41.140
 I have a bunch of what they call Blackguard Telecasters from the 50s, which are pretty

1:49:41.140 --> 1:49:42.140
 great.

1:49:42.140 --> 1:49:44.020
 What are those Blackguard Telecasters?

1:49:44.020 --> 1:49:45.020
 Yeah.

1:49:45.020 --> 1:49:46.020
 No, it's in the 50s.

1:49:46.020 --> 1:49:48.020
 Oh, they actually legit have a Blackguard.

1:49:48.020 --> 1:49:49.020
 Pickguard.

1:49:49.020 --> 1:49:50.020
 Got it.

1:49:50.020 --> 1:49:51.020
 But they're incredible.

1:49:51.020 --> 1:49:52.020
 So.

1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:53.580
 What's the color of the Telecaster itself?

1:49:53.580 --> 1:49:57.580
 Most of them are yellow with black and then they got into different configurations.

1:49:57.580 --> 1:50:04.420
 But there's something, I have a 51 Telecaster that I play in Open G and songs with Open

1:50:04.420 --> 1:50:10.580
 G that just, again, there's something, you know, and I'll take all the help I can get

1:50:10.580 --> 1:50:13.260
 in terms of, you know, making it sound great.

1:50:13.260 --> 1:50:16.060
 So I'll try to find the magic ones.

1:50:16.060 --> 1:50:21.740
 What's your writing process like for the music and the lyrics?

1:50:21.740 --> 1:50:26.180
 Is there, do you have to go to the mountains?

1:50:26.180 --> 1:50:27.180
 Is there whiskey involved?

1:50:27.180 --> 1:50:28.180
 What do you have to do?

1:50:28.180 --> 1:50:31.780
 Or do you just write a little bit, whenever you have a moment of free time?

1:50:31.780 --> 1:50:36.660
 I'm a boring guy because I don't drink, I don't, I just, I figure I can screw things

1:50:36.660 --> 1:50:39.460
 up plenty on my own without adding anything.

1:50:39.460 --> 1:50:41.180
 That's a good call.

1:50:41.180 --> 1:50:48.660
 But you know, for me, it either starts with, with a riff, just some, something that I think

1:50:48.660 --> 1:50:54.420
 is an interesting, you know, riff or tone that I, I can kind of sink my teeth into a

1:50:54.420 --> 1:50:55.420
 little bit.

1:50:55.420 --> 1:51:01.660
 And then a lot of times I'll write a title and love a title and then start to backfill.

1:51:01.660 --> 1:51:02.660
 Oh, cool.

1:51:02.660 --> 1:51:04.540
 So the title is almost like an idea.

1:51:04.540 --> 1:51:05.540
 Yeah.

1:51:05.540 --> 1:51:10.380
 Like this is where I want to be and, and then start kind of writing it out.

1:51:10.380 --> 1:51:16.620
 Again, I just have to know, am I writing from a character's point of view?

1:51:16.620 --> 1:51:23.020
 Am I writing about someone or something, you know, is like the narrator and, you know,

1:51:23.020 --> 1:51:24.020
 what is this person?

1:51:24.020 --> 1:51:25.020
 Are they happy?

1:51:25.020 --> 1:51:26.020
 Are they sad?

1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:27.860
 Are they, where are they in life?

1:51:27.860 --> 1:51:34.220
 I don't know if all that, like great writers, I'm sure would say, why don't you just write?

1:51:34.220 --> 1:51:36.220
 You don't need all that.

1:51:36.220 --> 1:51:38.260
 But that's, for me, that's my process.

1:51:38.260 --> 1:51:44.340
 I'm not so sure about that, and I bet you quite a lot of writers have created a world

1:51:44.340 --> 1:51:48.900
 in their mind before they even put the simplest of words down.

1:51:48.900 --> 1:51:55.140
 So yeah, there's, there's, there's quite a lot to that.

1:51:55.140 --> 1:51:57.860
 What's your favorite song to play?

1:51:57.860 --> 1:52:03.260
 Is there some favorite, favorite ones you go to both play and kind of, I'm sure you

1:52:03.260 --> 1:52:04.260
 love singing.

1:52:04.260 --> 1:52:05.260
 Oh, no, no, no.

1:52:05.260 --> 1:52:06.260
 No.

1:52:06.260 --> 1:52:07.260
 You don't.

1:52:07.260 --> 1:52:10.980
 And I'm neither talented nor do I have the desire.

1:52:10.980 --> 1:52:16.060
 And I think, you know, if you come see the show, you won't see a microphone anywhere near

1:52:16.060 --> 1:52:17.060
 me.

1:52:17.060 --> 1:52:21.020
 But do you, I mean, do you hear like when you're thinking about lyrics, do you hear the idea

1:52:21.020 --> 1:52:22.020
 of the words?

1:52:22.020 --> 1:52:23.020
 100%.

1:52:23.020 --> 1:52:28.740
 And especially what's great, you know, with Trey, is I write for his voice.

1:52:28.740 --> 1:52:35.140
 And then we have these amazing backup singers that are just, and I can hear all of it.

1:52:35.140 --> 1:52:38.060
 I just can't do it.

1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:44.980
 And so I'd say to, of our stuff, there's a song called Half My Fault that I play in

1:52:44.980 --> 1:52:50.620
 Open G that just, I love playing the song, I love that energy.

1:52:50.620 --> 1:52:54.060
 And then there's, we have a new blues album coming out.

1:52:54.060 --> 1:53:01.460
 And there's a song called Baby We're Through, and it just stays on the one.

1:53:01.460 --> 1:53:05.980
 And for non musicians, that means like in a lot of rock and roll and blues, it's what's

1:53:05.980 --> 1:53:11.140
 called a one, four, five progression from your, your kind of root note.

1:53:11.140 --> 1:53:14.900
 And you would hear, if you're a non musician, if you heard it, you'd be like, oh yeah, that's

1:53:14.900 --> 1:53:16.740
 a lot of songs.

1:53:16.740 --> 1:53:22.060
 And this song just stays on the same groove, like look range or shake your hips or any

1:53:22.060 --> 1:53:23.460
 of those songs.

1:53:23.460 --> 1:53:28.420
 And it's just got this unbelievable energy and it's fun to play, but I have to keep

1:53:28.420 --> 1:53:32.380
 the same rhythmic thing going for the whole song.

1:53:32.380 --> 1:53:33.620
 Well, that's simplicity.

1:53:33.620 --> 1:53:40.900
 I mean, the, the personality of the song can really shine me, Trey's, I mean, that guy,

1:53:40.900 --> 1:53:41.900
 really cool.

1:53:41.900 --> 1:53:43.380
 It just comes through.

1:53:43.380 --> 1:53:48.580
 I mean, I guess you need that from a lead singer is just, you just, you gotta have that.

1:53:48.580 --> 1:53:55.940
 And my other guitar player, Johnny Bob is, he's a phenomenal, I mean, like a legitimate

1:53:55.940 --> 1:54:03.820
 guitar slinger, you know, we probably split the leads 70, 30.

1:54:03.820 --> 1:54:08.380
 And he is just, you know, there's times, sometimes I look over at him and I'm like,

1:54:08.380 --> 1:54:12.940
 I'm being a fan right now because what you just laid down is pretty good.

1:54:12.940 --> 1:54:15.580
 From a lead perspective, what's the most fun thing to play?

1:54:15.580 --> 1:54:19.660
 What do you, what kind of stuff do you like slow, do you like, I mean, if you, if they're

1:54:19.660 --> 1:54:24.460
 like thrill is gone, there's, so if you look at BB King, sometimes one note just bending

1:54:24.460 --> 1:54:27.060
 the shit out of that, what do you call that vibrato?

1:54:27.060 --> 1:54:28.060
 Yeah.

1:54:28.060 --> 1:54:30.580
 If I'm going to play the lead, it's a certain kind of feel.

1:54:30.580 --> 1:54:36.020
 Slow blues is probably my favorite to play or something that's got a little more of that

1:54:36.020 --> 1:54:42.100
 Chuck Berry drive where you can be rhythmic in the lead.

1:54:42.100 --> 1:54:47.580
 You know, I can't, the shredding thing that those guys do is that's not, that might.

1:54:47.580 --> 1:54:51.500
 I was actually always able to do that really well.

1:54:51.500 --> 1:54:55.860
 Like you mentioned people that pick up fat, like maybe it's the classical piano training.

1:54:55.860 --> 1:55:00.500
 I could play super fast and guitar, super technical, but to me, the hardest thing and

1:55:00.500 --> 1:55:06.820
 the, my favorite thing is, it's just, has probably less to do with a guitar, more living

1:55:06.820 --> 1:55:07.820
 on life.

1:55:07.820 --> 1:55:13.940
 That's worth playing a guitar for, which is like a certain kind of emotion that you can

1:55:13.940 --> 1:55:17.220
 put into the notes and that has to do with bending notes.

1:55:17.220 --> 1:55:24.940
 Well, like bending notes is a whole other art form of, I worked surprisingly a long time

1:55:24.940 --> 1:55:32.540
 on comfortably numb and there's, so David Gilmour does a lot of bending and they're

1:55:32.540 --> 1:55:33.540
 simple.

1:55:33.540 --> 1:55:42.740
 They sound simple, but the dynamics of them to express like a build up in the way it's

1:55:42.740 --> 1:55:51.220
 held and there's often a vibrato at the top for a bit, just that the, it's almost like

1:55:51.220 --> 1:55:56.500
 a sigh and a sigh of relief and the build up, I mean, just the, that's an art form for

1:55:56.500 --> 1:55:58.220
 him that's hard to get right.

1:55:58.220 --> 1:56:04.100
 It's not just playing a note, playing a note, playing a note, it's, it's in that like dynamic

1:56:04.100 --> 1:56:06.500
 movement of a note that so much can happen.

1:56:06.500 --> 1:56:08.660
 That's where the blues is happens to.

1:56:08.660 --> 1:56:13.700
 It's, look, I'm a huge Freddie King fan too, right, who, and you listen to these guys and

1:56:13.700 --> 1:56:20.620
 they're, you sit there and they're like, man, you're, you're playing in a small range on

1:56:20.620 --> 1:56:27.380
 the neck, but in, you know, if it's like, I know the notes you're playing and I'm playing

1:56:27.380 --> 1:56:30.300
 them too, but not like that, right?

1:56:30.300 --> 1:56:36.140
 I mean, it's in, Gilmour is certainly one of those guys that's incredible guitar player.

1:56:36.140 --> 1:56:42.340
 And yet another chapter of an amazing life, you love football, like you meant, you, you

1:56:42.340 --> 1:56:43.340
 play football?

1:56:43.340 --> 1:56:44.340
 Yes.

1:56:44.340 --> 1:56:45.340
 What position did you play?

1:56:45.340 --> 1:56:46.340
 Wide receiver.

1:56:46.340 --> 1:56:47.340
 Wide receiver.

1:56:47.340 --> 1:56:48.340
 Awesome.

1:56:48.340 --> 1:56:57.700
 So, maybe you can talk a little bit about your love of football and the fact that you are

1:56:57.700 --> 1:57:00.380
 part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

1:57:00.380 --> 1:57:01.380
 Yeah.

1:57:01.380 --> 1:57:05.380
 So, I mean, where do we start to start the beginning, let's start at the end.

1:57:05.380 --> 1:57:06.940
 Why the Steelers?

1:57:06.940 --> 1:57:13.620
 What attracted you to the, first of all, I think not to be controversial, but one of

1:57:13.620 --> 1:57:19.220
 the best uniforms in football, in terms of just the black and gold, just.

1:57:19.220 --> 1:57:20.860
 DeKal only on one side.

1:57:20.860 --> 1:57:21.860
 Yeah, it's great.

1:57:21.860 --> 1:57:22.860
 Yeah.

1:57:22.860 --> 1:57:23.860
 The helmet.

1:57:23.860 --> 1:57:27.100
 Look, I've bled black and gold since I was a little boy.

1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:33.060
 I grew up in upstate New York and the first football game I ever saw was the Steelers

1:57:33.060 --> 1:57:39.220
 and the Super Bowl is a really little kid and it just, I mean, Jack Lambert and Joe

1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:45.020
 Green and Franco Harris and those guys were like, came down from Olympia, Mount Olympus

1:57:45.020 --> 1:57:46.020
 or something.

1:57:46.020 --> 1:57:50.980
 And I just was enamored with the team and because we only had three channels, the only

1:57:50.980 --> 1:57:57.380
 time I'd get to see them is occasionally when they were the game of the week or something.

1:57:57.380 --> 1:58:05.580
 And I just loved, to me, what they stood for, the toughness and they played football the

1:58:05.580 --> 1:58:08.140
 way that I thought was great.

1:58:08.140 --> 1:58:15.900
 I was a huge Jack Lambert fan, Hall of Fame linebacker who just intimidated everybody.

1:58:15.900 --> 1:58:25.580
 So that was the decade of the Steel curtain, arguably one of the great defensive in football

1:58:25.580 --> 1:58:26.580
 history.

1:58:26.580 --> 1:58:32.340
 And also one of the greatest football teams period in football history.

1:58:32.340 --> 1:58:40.140
 I've been a lifelong fan and was very fortunate to meet Mr. Rooney.

1:58:40.140 --> 1:58:48.780
 The Rooney family started the team in 1933, got to know him and just was asked to be part

1:58:48.780 --> 1:58:49.780
 of the ownership group.

1:58:49.780 --> 1:58:52.740
 I think it was the end of 2007.

1:58:52.740 --> 1:58:58.780
 First year as part of the group in 2008, we won the Super Bowl and it was like beyond

1:58:58.780 --> 1:59:02.260
 surreal and just beyond surreal.

1:59:02.260 --> 1:59:11.740
 And you know, it's amazing to be able to do, I mean, the Rooney family is one of those

1:59:11.740 --> 1:59:17.060
 most revered in sports or the way they conduct themselves.

1:59:17.060 --> 1:59:23.140
 Mr. Rooney passed away, I think five years ago now and we lost him, but was a champion,

1:59:23.140 --> 1:59:24.140
 helped build the league.

1:59:24.140 --> 1:59:27.540
 I mean, put the league as we know it together.

1:59:27.540 --> 1:59:34.500
 More importantly, was a civil rights champion who created what we now call the Rooney rule

1:59:34.500 --> 1:59:40.860
 to make sure that we're being fair about giving minority coaches a chance to get hired.

1:59:40.860 --> 1:59:48.060
 And just is one of the most kind and amazing human beings I've ever met.

1:59:48.060 --> 1:59:56.980
 It's incredible what sport does to bring out the best in people, to give people hope, to

1:59:56.980 --> 1:59:58.460
 inspire people.

1:59:58.460 --> 2:00:05.060
 There's something about football that has all the elements of a great sport.

2:00:05.060 --> 2:00:07.260
 It's the teamwork.

2:00:07.260 --> 2:00:10.820
 It's the sort of the combat aspect of it.

2:00:10.820 --> 2:00:11.980
 It's the purity of it.

2:00:11.980 --> 2:00:21.980
 It's of like strength and power and speed and all the elements of like last minute close

2:00:21.980 --> 2:00:25.540
 calls required to win the game.

2:00:25.540 --> 2:00:30.300
 And where referee decisions, of course that's essential for a sport, can screw up the whole

2:00:30.300 --> 2:00:31.300
 thing.

2:00:31.300 --> 2:00:32.300
 Just got all of it together.

2:00:32.300 --> 2:00:40.220
 I think just, I don't know, it gives the drama and the triumphs are just beautiful.

2:00:40.220 --> 2:00:44.660
 Some of my favorite memories, I don't know if it's an accident or this is common with

2:00:44.660 --> 2:00:50.460
 people is just with friends watching football and connecting over that.

2:00:50.460 --> 2:00:51.460
 Yeah.

2:00:51.460 --> 2:00:56.220
 Well, it's, look, it's an incredible game because there's nowhere to hide, right?

2:00:56.220 --> 2:00:57.820
 You're out there on the field.

2:00:57.820 --> 2:01:04.460
 You know, it's a great game that requires not only all those attributes that you said,

2:01:04.460 --> 2:01:07.700
 but it's incredibly complex game.

2:01:07.700 --> 2:01:12.260
 So if you don't know what you're looking at and you don't understand how complex defenses

2:01:12.260 --> 2:01:18.020
 are trying to disguise what they're doing, offenses are trying to overcome that.

2:01:18.020 --> 2:01:25.020
 And you can set up one play the entire, you know, the entire game, but a team that plays

2:01:25.020 --> 2:01:27.140
 well together, right?

2:01:27.140 --> 2:01:31.180
 Knows their plays inside and out, knows their assignments inside and out, can overcome and

2:01:31.180 --> 2:01:37.900
 beat a more physically gifted team because of that, you know, work that, that aspect

2:01:37.900 --> 2:01:38.900
 of working together.

2:01:38.900 --> 2:01:46.180
 What one of the things that I always loved about sports is just you're out there, there's

2:01:46.180 --> 2:01:49.100
 a set of rules and there's a scoreboard.

2:01:49.100 --> 2:01:55.060
 So at the end of that game, it says, and you can make excuses about the refs or this happened

2:01:55.060 --> 2:02:01.940
 or that happened, but, you know, at the end of the day, did you go out and compete?

2:02:01.940 --> 2:02:08.020
 And when you went out and we're a competitor, how did it work out, right?

2:02:08.020 --> 2:02:13.740
 And the simplicity of that and the purity of that is something that I always have been

2:02:13.740 --> 2:02:14.740
 drawn to.

2:02:14.740 --> 2:02:20.340
 What about the business of sort of owning a team or putting together a team or trying

2:02:20.340 --> 2:02:23.540
 to like build up a team that's going to be a great team?

2:02:23.540 --> 2:02:27.420
 Like, what are some interesting aspects that people might not realize that you can carry

2:02:27.420 --> 2:02:32.820
 over from all the other experience you have in business?

2:02:32.820 --> 2:02:38.940
 I think the hardest thing about professional sports right now, it's individuals getting

2:02:38.940 --> 2:02:45.500
 paid money to play a sport, which is different than, it's certainly different than amateur.

2:02:45.500 --> 2:02:51.100
 And you know, the decisions that are hard is when you get to know somebody who's a player

2:02:51.100 --> 2:02:56.260
 on the team and either they're at the end of their career or you need to go in a different

2:02:56.260 --> 2:03:02.140
 direction and that person who's done everything that you've asked, you know, whatever the

2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:07.660
 coaches have asked of that person and you get close to them and then when they have

2:03:07.660 --> 2:03:12.240
 to be traded, released or whatever happens, it's, you know, that's sad.

2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:21.020
 And being able to stand back and in some ways be dispassionate and not be a fan, right?

2:03:21.020 --> 2:03:29.380
 There's a, I'm on the Baseball Hall of Fame board and one of the guys that's on the board

2:03:29.380 --> 2:03:33.660
 of me is Jerry Rheinsdorf and I think it was Jerry who said, you know, if you act like

2:03:33.660 --> 2:03:37.620
 a fan, you'll be sitting with him, which I thought was kind of funny.

2:03:37.620 --> 2:03:45.340
 Well, I got to push back on that a little bit as a by way of a fan asking a dumb question.

2:03:45.340 --> 2:03:49.860
 Okay, let me just give some examples.

2:03:49.860 --> 2:03:51.740
 It's very common in sport.

2:03:51.740 --> 2:03:57.660
 It's funny you said this example of like certain great players going to another team right

2:03:57.660 --> 2:04:01.300
 at the end of their career.

2:04:01.300 --> 2:04:02.740
 And it always makes me sad.

2:04:02.740 --> 2:04:08.500
 It almost makes me want to wish that you kind of retired right there.

2:04:08.500 --> 2:04:15.740
 From a perspective of just like, do you ever, as a owner, but just in that space, think

2:04:15.740 --> 2:04:21.740
 about like the Steelers in the full arc of human history.

2:04:21.740 --> 2:04:26.100
 So not like as a business, okay, this question might be absurd.

2:04:26.100 --> 2:04:27.940
 The good news is I don't have to think about it as a business.

2:04:27.940 --> 2:04:28.940
 Right, exactly.

2:04:28.940 --> 2:04:29.940
 You could just be a fan.

2:04:29.940 --> 2:04:33.860
 You know, I'm a minority owner so I can think about it almost as a fan, but I'm sorry, go

2:04:33.860 --> 2:04:34.860
 ahead.

2:04:34.860 --> 2:04:35.860
 Yeah, well, that's what I mean.

2:04:35.860 --> 2:04:43.940
 I suppose this is a dumb question to think of like of a business in that way, not just

2:04:43.940 --> 2:04:52.940
 investment, but like legacy of like what footprint would you leave on this world, on this history?

2:04:52.940 --> 2:04:58.980
 That is one thing that I can say unequivocally, and I only have the experience that I have.

2:04:58.980 --> 2:05:06.620
 But one of the things that I'm so proud of about the way the Steelers conduct themselves

2:05:06.620 --> 2:05:12.100
 is, and that's the Rooney family, that's the legacy of the Rooney family is asking constantly

2:05:12.100 --> 2:05:17.620
 about what's right for the league, what's right for the players, you know, what's the

2:05:17.620 --> 2:05:19.180
 right thing to do here.

2:05:19.180 --> 2:05:22.980
 And that's something that I would hear Mr. Rooney say all the time.

2:05:22.980 --> 2:05:29.300
 So I think that legacy is important because ultimately the team belongs to that city,

2:05:29.300 --> 2:05:35.540
 right, belongs to those fans, and you know, the owners are the custodians of that.

2:05:35.540 --> 2:05:43.100
 So I think, and when you realize what sports teams mean to the fans, the memories that

2:05:43.100 --> 2:05:50.460
 it creates, the bonds that it creates, it's a, you know, it's a responsibility.

2:05:50.460 --> 2:05:56.500
 And I think that you do have to think beyond the, you know, certainly not just dollars

2:05:56.500 --> 2:06:03.420
 and cents, but just sports is a very big deal in our society.

2:06:03.420 --> 2:06:11.140
 And it has to be, I think, held to a standard that's not just, well, were we profitable

2:06:11.140 --> 2:06:12.140
 this year?

2:06:12.140 --> 2:06:15.100
 That's, there are other businesses for that.

2:06:15.100 --> 2:06:16.100
 It is certainly a business.

2:06:16.100 --> 2:06:22.300
 I don't mean to romanticize to the point that it's not, but to me, it's more than that,

2:06:22.300 --> 2:06:24.900
 or at least my experience has been that it's more than that.

2:06:24.900 --> 2:06:27.340
 It's a source of meaning for millions of people.

2:06:27.340 --> 2:06:33.580
 Like, and you see that most like doing COVID, for example, when there's so much desperation,

2:06:33.580 --> 2:06:37.220
 so maybe people losing their jobs, so many people having to deal with the uncertainty

2:06:37.220 --> 2:06:39.100
 what the future holds.

2:06:39.100 --> 2:06:46.460
 There's something about sports that just unites us that, again, the tragedy and the triumphs

2:06:46.460 --> 2:06:52.300
 of sport, of uniting, of gathering together with your friends, with family, shared experience

2:06:52.300 --> 2:07:00.020
 of over like this, yeah, over just team, over rooting for your team, for your city.

2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:04.980
 And the access, you know, again, as I alluded to, we didn't have anything when I was growing

2:07:04.980 --> 2:07:07.780
 up, but I would pour through the box scores.

2:07:07.780 --> 2:07:13.820
 I was a huge Yankee fan and Steeler fan and feeling some ownership of that, right, that

2:07:13.820 --> 2:07:19.860
 I could read the box score and relive what they did and occasionally see them on TV and

2:07:19.860 --> 2:07:24.340
 feel like I was part of that celebration when they won and everything.

2:07:24.340 --> 2:07:27.660
 It's a very powerful thing.

2:07:27.660 --> 2:07:32.100
 You've been exceptionally successful in a bunch of avenues and a bunch of efforts.

2:07:32.100 --> 2:07:38.180
 What advice would you give to a young person a day, a high school student, a college undergraduate

2:07:38.180 --> 2:07:46.140
 that's thinking about career, maybe advice not about just career, but about how to live

2:07:46.140 --> 2:07:49.340
 a life they can be proud of?

2:07:49.340 --> 2:07:53.620
 You know, we talked earlier about intellectual honesty and to me, that's the first step of

2:07:53.620 --> 2:08:00.220
 just saying to the best of your ability, who am I and what's important to me and what

2:08:00.220 --> 2:08:03.100
 do I want to do and accomplish.

2:08:03.100 --> 2:08:10.220
 If you can start with that and develop some sort of rules based philosophical, here's

2:08:10.220 --> 2:08:14.460
 what I'll do, what I won't do.

2:08:14.460 --> 2:08:20.020
 And that way, you can be flexible and pliable and you're going to need to be, but if you

2:08:20.020 --> 2:08:27.740
 still have a compass that tells you, hey, at least I know this is the path I'm going

2:08:27.740 --> 2:08:29.980
 to take, I think that's very important.

2:08:29.980 --> 2:08:35.900
 The rules you're referring to, the principles, that's kind of like underlying integrity,

2:08:35.900 --> 2:08:38.860
 so knowing what lines you don't cross on this path.

2:08:38.860 --> 2:08:44.140
 It's exactly right, because if you have those absolutes, there are many decisions that come

2:08:44.140 --> 2:08:51.260
 into focus very quickly, because, hey, that's not for me, or, hey, I'm willing to do whatever

2:08:51.260 --> 2:08:53.660
 it takes to do X, Y, and Z.

2:08:53.660 --> 2:08:56.660
 And it has to do with the thing you were talking about.

2:08:56.660 --> 2:09:01.220
 It's kind of interesting, you mentioned earlier in the conversation about slippery slope and

2:09:01.220 --> 2:09:07.860
 that's how often it happens, like how the slipping into unethical behavior happens.

2:09:07.860 --> 2:09:11.820
 It's the slippery slope of little adjustments, you put stuff off.

2:09:11.820 --> 2:09:19.980
 And I found that to be, I've been fortunate to not have to encounter these moments very

2:09:19.980 --> 2:09:22.940
 much in my life, but I still encounter them.

2:09:22.940 --> 2:09:29.220
 That's what integrity, I think, looks like as the slippery slope is happening, those

2:09:29.220 --> 2:09:37.500
 little things, is without drama, without making a show of it, making a decision that stands

2:09:37.500 --> 2:09:40.460
 behind your principles and just walking away.

2:09:40.460 --> 2:09:44.300
 And besides the big ideas, I'm going to change the world.

2:09:44.300 --> 2:09:48.020
 I'm going to innovate, I'm going to do all those other things.

2:09:48.020 --> 2:09:54.700
 I also start, if I'm giving any advice, which we can debate whether or not I should be giving

2:09:54.700 --> 2:09:59.180
 advice, but just in terms of, well, let me start with this.

2:09:59.180 --> 2:10:01.260
 Are you a good friend?

2:10:01.260 --> 2:10:02.460
 Can you be counted on?

2:10:02.460 --> 2:10:07.180
 Do you do what you say you're going to do, right?

2:10:07.180 --> 2:10:12.540
 Are you accountable to what you sign up for and do you hold others accountable, right?

2:10:12.540 --> 2:10:13.900
 What does all that look like?

2:10:13.900 --> 2:10:20.260
 And then I think it's being as intellectually curious and well read as you can be.

2:10:20.260 --> 2:10:24.860
 We live in a world that is designed to distract you, right?

2:10:24.860 --> 2:10:30.820
 And being able to sit with your thoughts or go on a walk and think deeply about something

2:10:30.820 --> 2:10:36.180
 and not just surface area, you text me, I text you back and we decide the fate of the

2:10:36.180 --> 2:10:42.380
 world based on a couple of text messages or something.

2:10:42.380 --> 2:10:48.900
 You don't want to lose touch, I think, with being well read and understanding and standing

2:10:48.900 --> 2:10:55.500
 on great thinkers shoulders and learning from those works.

2:10:55.500 --> 2:11:02.420
 And then I also think that there's resiliency and then there's grit.

2:11:02.420 --> 2:11:07.260
 And I heard someone say one time that those are slightly different.

2:11:07.260 --> 2:11:16.820
 And I know that there are all kinds of challenges in life that are tragic, that are unfair.

2:11:16.820 --> 2:11:19.420
 There's no question that's the world we live in.

2:11:19.420 --> 2:11:28.300
 But for me personally, to try as much as possible not to be in the victim mindset because unfair

2:11:28.300 --> 2:11:36.700
 things are going to happen and we all want to live in an idealistic just world.

2:11:36.700 --> 2:11:40.060
 That should be what we aspire to.

2:11:40.060 --> 2:11:41.420
 I haven't seen that yet.

2:11:41.420 --> 2:11:47.260
 I haven't experienced that yet, but yet you still have to function in that world.

2:11:47.260 --> 2:11:52.900
 So I think that that resiliency thing is very important.

2:11:52.900 --> 2:11:58.660
 And then putting yourself out there, right, because if you play scared and you're always

2:11:58.660 --> 2:12:05.260
 afraid to fail, you know, this is probably a dumb way to get to the end of the podcast.

2:12:05.260 --> 2:12:12.540
 But there are times, especially I'm out West, I love the big sky out in Montana, Idaho,

2:12:12.540 --> 2:12:13.540
 places like that.

2:12:13.540 --> 2:12:17.980
 And when you look up at night, it's almost like I've never seen anything like this before

2:12:17.980 --> 2:12:22.540
 because there's no light pollution, so to speak.

2:12:22.540 --> 2:12:27.740
 And sometimes when I look up, the most daunting problems that I've experienced, I'm like,

2:12:27.740 --> 2:12:33.500
 those things have been there for a billion years or whatever, and I'll be gone and it

2:12:33.500 --> 2:12:41.500
 doesn't, you know, the most famous person on earth 200 years ago.

2:12:41.500 --> 2:12:45.060
 So it's pretty fleeting.

2:12:45.060 --> 2:12:50.500
 And so make sure you have a good journey and especially coming out of COVID.

2:12:50.500 --> 2:12:54.860
 I think telling people that you care about that you care about them and maintaining and

2:12:54.860 --> 2:13:01.500
 cultivating your friendships and relationships, and they're not just transactional, right?

2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:06.820
 And making sure that someday when you're laying there, you can say, yeah, I was good family

2:13:06.820 --> 2:13:07.820
 member.

2:13:07.820 --> 2:13:10.180
 I was a good, a good friend.

2:13:10.180 --> 2:13:11.980
 I was someone that could be counted on.

2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:17.620
 I think all those things go into the mix of, you know, however you want to take the journey.

2:13:17.620 --> 2:13:23.140
 So when you look up to the stars, do you think about that quickly approaching end of yours?

2:13:23.140 --> 2:13:24.660
 Do you think about your own mortality?

2:13:24.660 --> 2:13:25.660
 Do you think about your death?

2:13:25.660 --> 2:13:27.700
 Are you afraid of your death?

2:13:27.700 --> 2:13:30.420
 I'm a huge fan of stoicism, right?

2:13:30.420 --> 2:13:32.740
 I read a lot of stoicism.

2:13:32.740 --> 2:13:39.100
 Like Ryan Holiday has done a great job of bringing some of that back and to the forefront.

2:13:39.100 --> 2:13:45.780
 It's just really thought provoking to me and rings, a lot of it rings just hits me and

2:13:45.780 --> 2:13:47.980
 says, I think that's right.

2:13:47.980 --> 2:13:53.180
 And that momenta, memento mori thing, which is, hey, we're all going to die.

2:13:53.180 --> 2:13:56.500
 So you should contemplate it.

2:13:56.500 --> 2:13:58.920
 There's a finality to this thing.

2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:05.820
 And so I think if you can rightly frame that between fretting about it every day and being

2:14:05.820 --> 2:14:10.980
 afraid and being so laissez faire that you think, you know, you're going to, you're going

2:14:10.980 --> 2:14:17.420
 to live forever, it'll influence some of the decisions you make, it will influence the

2:14:17.420 --> 2:14:23.500
 way you attack things and hopefully the way that you live your life.

2:14:23.500 --> 2:14:31.820
 So yes, I wouldn't say I obsess over it and I wouldn't say it's omnipresent.

2:14:31.820 --> 2:14:36.260
 But because I read a lot of stoicism and just I think it's, it's right to pause and

2:14:36.260 --> 2:14:38.860
 say, who knows, right?

2:14:38.860 --> 2:14:44.500
 There's going to be an expiration date and if it happened tomorrow and my, have I done

2:14:44.500 --> 2:14:50.260
 the things I wanted to do and am I the person I wanted to be?

2:14:50.260 --> 2:14:53.580
 And I think it's important along the way to check those things.

2:14:53.580 --> 2:14:54.580
 Yeah.

2:14:54.580 --> 2:15:00.020
 I try to make sure that I actually visualize this that I'm okay dying at the end of the

2:15:00.020 --> 2:15:03.260
 day at the end of each day.

2:15:03.260 --> 2:15:07.220
 Like if this is the last thing I do in my life is talking to you.

2:15:07.220 --> 2:15:09.100
 Oh, good Lord.

2:15:09.100 --> 2:15:12.820
 I'm, I'm happy.

2:15:12.820 --> 2:15:19.220
 I know you're joking, but I'm, I, you know, that, yeah, I'm happy I get to live the life

2:15:19.220 --> 2:15:20.220
 I do.

2:15:20.220 --> 2:15:23.220
 And I think my mentor more, I think the, the stoics have it right.

2:15:23.220 --> 2:15:30.020
 So you, and you have it right in saying meditate on death enough to remember that this ride

2:15:30.020 --> 2:15:35.500
 ends pretty quickly to help you appreciate every day and the people you love, the people

2:15:35.500 --> 2:15:40.900
 close to you and the cool shit that you're doing in your life, the cool shit you're creating

2:15:40.900 --> 2:15:47.380
 and the fact that you, Mr. Thomas tall are playing with the motherfucking rolling stones

2:15:47.380 --> 2:15:48.700
 tomorrow.

2:15:48.700 --> 2:15:53.020
 You are the man in so many disciplines, so, so respect is so successful.

2:15:53.020 --> 2:15:54.540
 It's truly an honor.

2:15:54.540 --> 2:15:59.580
 You sit down and talk with me today, Thomas, thank you so much for showing up in Texas

2:15:59.580 --> 2:16:01.660
 and for talking on this little podcast.

2:16:01.660 --> 2:16:02.700
 Oh, it's great, man.

2:16:02.700 --> 2:16:08.140
 I'm a huge fan of the show and I've had a great time hanging with you and really appreciate

2:16:08.140 --> 2:16:09.140

 And now let me leave you with some words from Mick Jagger and the rolling stones.

2:16:21.380 --> 2:16:26.540
 You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you might find you'll get

2:16:26.540 --> 2:16:28.460
 what you need.

2:16:28.460 --> 2:16:41.140
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
