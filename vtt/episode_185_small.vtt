00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
 The following is a conversation with Sam Harris, one of the most influential and pioneering

00:04.600 --> 00:06.280
 thinkers of our time.

00:06.280 --> 00:10.840
 He is the host of the Making Sense podcast and the author of many seminal books on human

00:10.840 --> 00:16.960
 nature and the human mind, including The End of Faith, The Moral Landscape, Lying, Free

00:16.960 --> 00:18.680
 Will, and Waking Up.

00:18.680 --> 00:24.960
 He also has a meditation app called Waking Up that I've been using to guide my own meditation.

00:24.960 --> 00:31.720
 Look mentioned of our sponsors, National Instruments, Val Campo, Athletic Greens, and Linode.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.960
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:34.960 --> 00:40.400
 As a side note, let me say that Sam has been an inspiration to me as he has been for many,

00:40.400 --> 00:46.720
 many people, first from his writing, then his early debates, maybe 13, 14 years ago on

00:46.720 --> 00:54.400
 the subject of faith, his conversations with Christopher Hitchens, and since 2013 his podcast.

00:54.400 --> 00:59.600
 I didn't always agree with all of his ideas, but I was always drawn to the care and depth

00:59.600 --> 01:02.040
 of the way he explored those ideas.

01:02.040 --> 01:07.600
 The calm and clarity amid the storm of difficult, at times controversial discourse.

01:07.600 --> 01:13.040
 I really can't express in words how much it meant to me that he, Sam Harris, someone

01:13.040 --> 01:18.200
 who I have listened to for many hundreds of hours, would write a kind email to me saying

01:18.200 --> 01:24.360
 he enjoyed this podcast and more that he thought I had a unique voice that added something

01:24.360 --> 01:26.000
 to this world.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.120
 Whether it's true or not, it made me feel special and truly grateful to be able to do

01:30.120 --> 01:35.680
 this thing and motivated me to work my ass off to live up to those words.

01:35.680 --> 01:41.840
 Meeting Sam and getting to talk with him was one of the most memorable moments of my life.

01:41.840 --> 01:48.680
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Sam Harris.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.760
 I've been enjoying meditating with the Waking Up app recently.

01:52.760 --> 01:59.000
 It makes me think about the origins of cognition and consciousness, so let me ask, where do

01:59.000 --> 02:00.480
 thoughts come from?

02:00.480 --> 02:05.440
 Well, that's a very difficult question to answer.

02:05.440 --> 02:10.800
 Subjectively, they appear to come from nowhere.

02:10.800 --> 02:17.960
 They come out of some kind of mystery that is at our backs subjectively, which is to

02:17.960 --> 02:26.240
 say that if you pay attention to the nature of your mind in this moment, you realize that

02:26.240 --> 02:28.480
 you don't know what you're going to think next.

02:28.480 --> 02:33.600
 Now, you're expecting to think something that seems like you authored it.

02:33.600 --> 02:39.160
 You're not unless you're schizophrenic or you have some kind of thought disorder where

02:39.160 --> 02:41.960
 your thoughts seem fundamentally foreign to you.

02:41.960 --> 02:49.680
 They do have a kind of signature of selfhood associated with them and people readily identify

02:49.680 --> 02:50.680
 with them.

02:50.680 --> 02:51.840
 They feel like what you are.

02:51.840 --> 02:56.120
 I mean, this is the thing, this is the spell that gets broken with meditation.

02:56.120 --> 03:04.760
 Our default state is to feel identical to the stream of thought, which is fairly paradoxical

03:04.760 --> 03:11.920
 because how could you as a mind, as a self, if there were such a thing as a self, have

03:11.920 --> 03:19.200
 how could you be identical to the next piece of language or the next image that just springs

03:19.200 --> 03:28.640
 into conscious view, and meditation is ultimately about examining that point of view closely

03:28.640 --> 03:35.320
 enough so as to unravel it and feel the freedom that's on the other side of that identification.

03:35.320 --> 03:43.480
 The subjectively thoughts simply emerge and you don't think them before you think them.

03:43.480 --> 03:49.800
 This is the first moment where anyone listening to us or watching us now could perform this

03:49.800 --> 03:51.160
 experiment for themselves.

03:51.160 --> 03:54.960
 Just imagine something or remember something.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.720
 Just pick a memory, any memory.

03:56.720 --> 04:03.000
 You've got a storehouse of memory, just promote one to consciousness.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
 Did you pick that memory?

04:04.000 --> 04:08.520
 I mean, let's say you remembered breakfast yesterday, or you remembered what you said

04:08.520 --> 04:13.280
 to your spouse before leaving the house, or you remembered what you watched on Netflix

04:13.280 --> 04:17.120
 last night, or you remembered something that happened to you when you're four years old,

04:17.120 --> 04:26.120
 whatever it is, first it wasn't there, and then it appeared.

04:26.120 --> 04:31.720
 That is not a, I'm sure we'll get to the topic of free will ultimately, that's not evidence

04:31.720 --> 04:32.720
 of free will, right?

04:32.720 --> 04:34.960
 Why are you so sure, by the way?

04:34.960 --> 04:35.960
 It's very interesting.

04:35.960 --> 04:40.360
 Well, yeah, there's no free will of my own, yeah.

04:40.360 --> 04:44.480
 Everything just appears, but what else could it do?

04:44.480 --> 04:46.080
 That's the subjective side of it.

04:46.080 --> 04:50.720
 Objectively, we have every reason to believe that many of our thoughts, all of our thoughts

04:50.720 --> 04:58.440
 are at bottom what some part of our brain is doing neurophysiologically.

04:58.440 --> 05:05.320
 These are the products of some kind of neural computation, neural representation, and we're

05:05.320 --> 05:06.960
 talking about memories.

05:06.960 --> 05:14.840
 Is it possible to pull at the string of thoughts that try to get to its root to try to dig

05:14.840 --> 05:21.680
 in past the obvious surface subjective experience of the thoughts pop out of nowhere?

05:21.680 --> 05:27.040
 Is it possible to somehow get closer to the roots of where they come out of from the firing

05:27.040 --> 05:32.920
 of the cells, or is it a useless pursuit to dig into that direction?

05:32.920 --> 05:40.840
 You can get closer to many, many subtle contents in consciousness, so you can notice things

05:40.840 --> 05:46.400
 more and more clearly and have a landscape of mind open up and become more differentiated

05:46.400 --> 05:47.400
 and more interesting.

05:47.400 --> 05:54.040
 If you take psychedelics, it opens up wide depending on what you've taken and the dose.

05:54.040 --> 05:59.840
 It opens in directions and to an extent that very few people imagine would be possible,

05:59.840 --> 06:02.280
 but for having had those experiences.

06:02.280 --> 06:10.000
 But this idea of you getting closer to something, to the datum of your mind, or something of

06:10.000 --> 06:16.640
 interest in there, or something that's more real, is ultimately undermined because there's

06:16.640 --> 06:19.640
 no place from which you're getting closer to it.

06:19.640 --> 06:23.520
 There's no your part of that journey.

06:23.520 --> 06:32.880
 We tend to start out, whether it's in meditation or in any kind of self examination or taking

06:32.880 --> 06:33.880
 psychedelics.

06:33.880 --> 06:41.760
 We start out with this default point of view of feeling like we're the rider on the horse

06:41.760 --> 06:47.800
 of consciousness, or we're the man in the boat going down the stream of consciousness,

06:47.800 --> 06:56.200
 but we're differentiated from what we know cognitively, introspectively.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.240
 But that feeling of being differentiated, that feeling of being a self that can strategically

07:00.240 --> 07:08.160
 pay attention to some contents of consciousness is what it's like to be identified with some

07:08.160 --> 07:11.720
 part of the stream of thought that's going uninspected.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.720
 It's a false point of view.

07:13.720 --> 07:21.560
 And when you see that and cut through that, then this sense of this notion of going deeper

07:21.560 --> 07:26.600
 kind of breaks apart because really, there is no depth ultimately, everything is right

07:26.600 --> 07:27.600
 on the surface.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.480
 There's no center to consciousness, there's just consciousness in its contents.

07:30.480 --> 07:38.240
 And those contents can change vastly, again, if you drop acid, the contents change.

07:38.240 --> 07:46.360
 But in some sense, that doesn't represent a position of depth versus, the continuum

07:46.360 --> 07:49.240
 of depth versus surface has broken apart.

07:49.240 --> 07:54.360
 So you're taking as a starting point that there is a horse called consciousness and

07:54.360 --> 07:59.840
 you're riding it, and the actual riding is very shallow, this is all surface.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.640
 So let me ask about that horse.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.000
 What's up with the horse?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.440
 What is consciousness?

08:07.440 --> 08:09.880
 From where does it emerge?

08:09.880 --> 08:13.160
 How like fundamental is it to the physics of reality?

08:13.160 --> 08:16.800
 How fundamental is it to what it means to be human?

08:16.800 --> 08:21.960
 And I'm just asking for a friend so that we can build it in our artificial intelligence

08:21.960 --> 08:22.960
 systems.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.960
 Yeah.

08:23.960 --> 08:29.600
 Well, that remains to be seen if we can, if we will build it purposefully or just by

08:29.600 --> 08:30.600
 accident.

08:30.600 --> 08:38.120
 There's a major ethical problem, potentially, that I mean, my concern here is that we may

08:38.120 --> 08:44.840
 in fact build artificial intelligence that passes the Turing test, which we begin to

08:44.840 --> 08:51.280
 treat not only as super intelligent because it obviously is and demonstrates that, but

08:51.280 --> 08:54.920
 we begin to treat it as conscious because it will seem conscious.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.160
 We will have built it to seem conscious.

08:57.160 --> 09:04.880
 And unless we understand exactly how consciousness emerges from physics, we won't actually know

09:04.880 --> 09:06.440
 that these systems are conscious.

09:06.440 --> 09:11.120
 They may say, listen, you can't turn me off because that's a murder.

09:11.120 --> 09:18.600
 And we will be convinced by that dialogue because we will, just in the extreme case,

09:18.600 --> 09:25.840
 who knows when we'll get there, but if we build something like perfectly humanoid robots

09:25.840 --> 09:29.200
 that are more intelligent than we are, so we're basically in, you know, a Westworld

09:29.200 --> 09:34.480
 like situation, there's no way we're going to withhold an attribution of consciousness

09:34.480 --> 09:35.480
 from those machines.

09:35.480 --> 09:40.640
 It's just going to seem, they're going to advertise their consciousness in every glance

09:40.640 --> 09:43.000
 and every utterance.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.560
 But we won't know, and we won't know in some deeper sense than it make, than we can be

09:48.560 --> 09:51.120
 skeptical of the consciousness of other people.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.440
 I mean, if someone could roll that back and say, well, you don't, you know, I don't know

09:53.440 --> 09:56.160
 that you're conscious or you don't know that I'm conscious, we're just passing the turing

09:56.160 --> 09:57.280
 test for one another.

09:57.280 --> 10:04.200
 But that kind of solipsism isn't justified, you know, biologically or we just, anything

10:04.200 --> 10:10.320
 we understand about the mind biologically suggests that you and I are part of the same,

10:10.320 --> 10:19.000
 you know, roll the dice in terms of how intelligent and conscious systems emerged in the wet

10:19.000 --> 10:21.960
 wear of brains like ours, right?

10:21.960 --> 10:26.320
 So it's not parsimonious for me to think that I might be the only conscious person or even

10:26.320 --> 10:31.720
 the only conscious primate, you know, I would argue it's not parsimonious to withhold consciousness

10:31.720 --> 10:36.880
 from other apes and even other mammals ultimately.

10:36.880 --> 10:41.440
 And you know, once you get beyond the mammals, then my intuitions are not really clear.

10:41.440 --> 10:46.440
 The question of how it emerges is genuinely uncertain and ultimately the question of whether

10:46.440 --> 10:49.480
 it emerges is still uncertain.

10:49.480 --> 10:55.680
 You can, you know, it's not, it's not fashionable to think this, but you can certainly argue

10:55.680 --> 11:02.320
 that consciousness might be a fundamental principle of matter that doesn't emerge on

11:02.320 --> 11:09.200
 the basis of information processing, even though everything else that we recognize about ourselves

11:09.200 --> 11:13.040
 as minds almost certainly does emerge, you know, like an ability to process language

11:13.040 --> 11:18.160
 that clearly is a matter of information processing because you can disrupt that process in ways

11:18.160 --> 11:23.040
 that is, it's just so clear.

11:23.040 --> 11:30.520
 And the problem that the confound with consciousness is that, yes, we can seem to interrupt consciousness

11:30.520 --> 11:35.240
 and you can give someone general anesthesia and then you wake them up and you ask them,

11:35.240 --> 11:36.240
 well, what was that like?

11:36.240 --> 11:38.840
 And they say, nothing, I don't remember anything.

11:38.840 --> 11:49.240
 But it's hard to differentiate a mere failure of memory from a genuine interruption in consciousness,

11:49.240 --> 11:53.040
 whereas it's not with, you know, interrupting speech, you know, we know when we've done

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
 it.

11:54.040 --> 11:59.520
 And it's, it's just obvious that, you know, you disrupt the right neural circuits and

11:59.520 --> 12:01.960
 you, you know, you've disrupted speech.

12:01.960 --> 12:06.680
 So if you had to bet all your money on one camp or the other, would you say, do you earn

12:06.680 --> 12:15.000
 a side of panpsychism, where consciousness is really fundamental to our, to all of reality

12:15.000 --> 12:20.760
 or more on the other side, which is like, it's a nice little side effect, a useful like

12:20.760 --> 12:26.680
 hack for us humans to survive, where on that spectrum, where do you land when you think

12:26.680 --> 12:30.320
 about consciousness, especially from an engineering perspective?

12:30.320 --> 12:33.160
 I'm truly agnostic on this point.

12:33.160 --> 12:37.760
 I mean, I think I'm, you know, it's kind of in coin toss mode for me.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.360
 I don't know.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.480
 And panpsychism is not so compelling to me.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.880
 Again, it just seems unfalsifiable.

12:46.880 --> 12:50.600
 I wouldn't know how the universe would be different if panpsychism were true.

12:50.600 --> 12:56.600
 And just to remind people, panpsychism is this idea that consciousness may be pushed

12:56.600 --> 12:59.560
 all the way down into the most fundamental constituents of matters.

12:59.560 --> 13:06.960
 So there might be something that it's like to be an electron or, you know, a cork, but

13:06.960 --> 13:12.040
 then you wouldn't expect anything to be different at the macro scale, or at least I wouldn't

13:12.040 --> 13:14.800
 expect anything to be different.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.000
 So it may be unfalsifiable.

13:17.000 --> 13:26.480
 It just might be that reality is not something we're as in touch with as we think we are,

13:26.480 --> 13:33.000
 and that if that is base layer to kind of break it into mind and matter as we've done

13:33.000 --> 13:37.320
 ontologically, is to misconstrue it, right?

13:37.320 --> 13:41.440
 I mean, there could be some kind of neutral monism at the bottom.

13:41.440 --> 13:44.000
 And this, you know, this idea doesn't originate with me.

13:44.000 --> 13:51.160
 This goes all the way back to Bertrand Russell and others, you know, 100 plus years ago.

13:51.160 --> 14:00.000
 But I just feel like the concepts we're using to divide consciousness and matter may in fact

14:00.000 --> 14:02.480
 be part of our problem, right?

14:02.480 --> 14:08.440
 Where the rubber hits the road psychologically here are things like, well, what is death,

14:08.440 --> 14:09.440
 right?

14:09.440 --> 14:14.680
 Like, do we, any expectation that we survive death or any part of us survives death?

14:14.680 --> 14:19.800
 That really seems to be the, the many people's concern here.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.720
 Well, I tend to believe just as a small little tangent, like I'm with Ernest Becker on this,

14:24.720 --> 14:29.400
 that there's some, it's interesting to think about death and consciousness.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.040
 Which one is the chicken?

14:31.040 --> 14:32.040
 Which one is the egg?

14:32.040 --> 14:36.240
 Because it feels like death could be the very thing, like our knowledge of mortality could

14:36.240 --> 14:38.440
 be the very thing that creates the consciousness.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.440
 Yeah.

14:39.440 --> 14:43.520
 Well, then you're using consciousness differently than I am.

14:43.520 --> 14:50.160
 I mean, so for me, consciousness is just the fact that the lights are on at all, that there's

14:50.160 --> 14:53.040
 an experiential quality to anything.

14:53.040 --> 14:59.840
 So much of the processing that's happening in our brains right now seems, certainly seems

14:59.840 --> 15:01.960
 to be happening in the dark, right?

15:01.960 --> 15:07.360
 Like it's not associated with this qualitative sense that there's something that is like

15:07.360 --> 15:13.680
 to be that part of the mind doing that mental thing.

15:13.680 --> 15:19.880
 But for other parts, the lights are on and we can talk about and whether we talk about

15:19.880 --> 15:27.480
 it or not, we can feel directly that there's something that is like to be us, there's something

15:27.480 --> 15:30.040
 that seems to be happening, right?

15:30.040 --> 15:39.480
 And this seeming in our case is broken into vision and hearing and proprioception and taste

15:39.480 --> 15:43.240
 and smell and thought and emotion.

15:43.240 --> 15:51.880
 There are the contents of consciousness that we are familiar with and that we can have

15:51.880 --> 15:57.880
 direct access to in any present moment that when we're, quote, conscious.

15:57.880 --> 16:02.320
 And even if we're confused about them, even if, you know, we're asleep and dreaming and

16:02.320 --> 16:07.920
 we really, and we're, it's not a lucid dream, we're just totally confused about our circumstance.

16:07.920 --> 16:12.280
 What you can't say is that we're confused about consciousness.

16:12.280 --> 16:18.960
 Like you can't say that consciousness itself might be an illusion because on this account,

16:18.960 --> 16:22.120
 it just means that things seem any way at all.

16:22.120 --> 16:25.960
 I mean, even like if this, you know, it seems to me that I'm seeing a cup on the table.

16:25.960 --> 16:29.720
 Now, I could be wrong about that, it could be a hologram, I could be asleep and dreaming,

16:29.720 --> 16:36.320
 I could be hallucinating, but the seeming part isn't really up for grabs in terms of

16:36.320 --> 16:37.920
 being an illusion.

16:37.920 --> 16:41.880
 It's not something seems to be happening.

16:41.880 --> 16:49.920
 And that seeming is the context in which every other thing we can notice about ourselves

16:49.920 --> 16:50.920
 can be noticed.

16:50.920 --> 16:55.120
 And it's also the context in which certain illusions can be cut through because we're

16:55.120 --> 16:57.880
 not, we can be wrong about what it's like to be us.

16:57.880 --> 17:04.880
 And we can, I'm not saying we're incorrigible with respect to our claims about the nature

17:04.880 --> 17:09.520
 of our experience, but for instance, this, you know, many people feel like they have

17:09.520 --> 17:12.200
 a self and they feel like it has free will.

17:12.200 --> 17:17.000
 And I'm quite sure at this point that they're wrong about that and that you can, you can

17:17.000 --> 17:22.160
 cut through those experiences and then things seem a different way, right?

17:22.160 --> 17:27.320
 So it's not that things don't, there aren't discoveries to be made there and assumptions

17:27.320 --> 17:36.440
 to be overturned, but this kind of consciousness is something that I would think, it doesn't

17:36.440 --> 17:41.480
 just come online when we get language, it doesn't just come online when we form a concept

17:41.480 --> 17:48.240
 of death or the finiteness of life, it doesn't require a sense of self, right?

17:48.240 --> 17:54.280
 So it doesn't, it's prior to a differentiating self and other.

17:54.280 --> 17:58.840
 And I wouldn't even think it's necessarily limited to people.

17:58.840 --> 18:05.800
 I do think probably any mammal has this, but certainly if you're going to, if you're going

18:05.800 --> 18:12.000
 to presuppose that something about our brains is producing this, right?

18:12.000 --> 18:19.840
 And that's a very safe assumption, even though we can't, even though you can argue the jury

18:19.840 --> 18:22.560
 is still out to some degree.

18:22.560 --> 18:28.880
 Then it's very hard to draw a principled line between us and chimps, or chimps and rats

18:28.880 --> 18:33.160
 even in the end, given the underlying neural similarities.

18:33.160 --> 18:38.680
 So I don't know, phylogenetically, I don't know how far back to push that.

18:38.680 --> 18:43.520
 Where people think single cells might be conscious, or that flies are certainly conscious, they've

18:43.520 --> 18:50.800
 got something like 100,000 neurons in their brains, and it's just, there's a lot going

18:50.800 --> 18:53.360
 on even in a fly, right?

18:53.360 --> 18:55.600
 But I don't have intuitions about that.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.320
 But it's not in your sense an illusion you can cut through.

18:58.320 --> 19:05.680
 I mean, to push back, the alternative version could be, it is an illusion constructed just

19:05.680 --> 19:10.360
 by humans, I'm not sure I believe this, but it, in part of me, hopes this is true because

19:10.360 --> 19:17.640
 it makes it easier to engineer, is that humans are able to contemplate their mortality.

19:17.640 --> 19:24.240
 And that contemplation in itself creates consciousness, like the rich lights on experience.

19:24.240 --> 19:31.080
 So the lights don't actually even turn on in the way that you're describing until afterbirth

19:31.080 --> 19:32.080
 in that construction.

19:32.080 --> 19:38.080
 Do you think it's possible that that is the case, that it is a sort of construct of the

19:38.080 --> 19:43.960
 way we deal, almost like a social tool to deal with the reality of the world, the social

19:43.960 --> 19:46.680
 interaction with other humans?

19:46.680 --> 19:50.840
 Or is, because you're saying the complete opposite, which is it's like fundamental to

19:50.840 --> 19:54.920
 single cell organisms and trees and so on.

19:54.920 --> 19:55.920
 Right.

19:55.920 --> 19:56.920
 Well, yeah.

19:56.920 --> 19:57.920
 So I don't know how far down to push it.

19:57.920 --> 20:03.760
 I don't have intuitions that single cells are likely to be conscious, but they might

20:03.760 --> 20:04.760
 be.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.320
 And I just, and again, I could be unfalsifiable.

20:08.320 --> 20:12.160
 But as far as babies not being conscious or you're not, you don't become conscious until

20:12.160 --> 20:17.400
 you can recognize yourself in a mirror or you have a conversation or treat other people.

20:17.400 --> 20:24.600
 First of all, babies treat other people as others far earlier than we have traditionally

20:24.600 --> 20:29.160
 given them credit for, and they certainly do it before they have language, right?

20:29.160 --> 20:34.320
 So it's got to proceed language to some degree.

20:34.320 --> 20:40.200
 And I mean, you can interrogate this for yourself because you can put yourself in various states

20:40.200 --> 20:48.840
 that are rather obviously not linguistic, you know, meditation allows you to do this.

20:48.840 --> 20:54.080
 You can certainly do it with psychedelics where it's just, your capacity for language

20:54.080 --> 20:58.840
 has been obliterated and yet you're all too conscious.

20:58.840 --> 21:09.600
 In fact, I think you could make a stronger argument for things running the other way,

21:09.600 --> 21:17.320
 that there's something about language and conceptual thought that is eliminative of conscious

21:17.320 --> 21:25.320
 experience, that we're potentially much more conscious of data, sense data and everything

21:25.320 --> 21:33.760
 else than we tend to be, and we have trimmed it down based on how we have acquired concepts.

21:33.760 --> 21:39.240
 And so like when I walk into a room like this, I know I'm walking into a room, I have certain

21:39.240 --> 21:44.640
 expectations of what is in a room, you know, I would be very surprised to see, you know,

21:44.640 --> 21:52.760
 all the animals in here or waterfall or things I'm not expecting, but I can know I'm not

21:52.760 --> 21:57.520
 expecting them or I'm expecting their absence because of my capacity to be surprised once

21:57.520 --> 22:02.000
 I walk into a room and I see a live gorilla or whatever.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.880
 So there's structure there that we have put in place based on all of our conceptual learning

22:08.880 --> 22:16.240
 and language and language learning and it causes us not to, one of the things that happens

22:16.240 --> 22:21.880
 when you take psychedelics and you just look as though for the first time at anything, it

22:21.880 --> 22:34.440
 becomes incredibly overloaded with, it can become overloaded with meaning and just the

22:34.440 --> 22:39.200
 torrents of sense data that are coming in in even the most ordinary circumstances can

22:39.200 --> 22:40.880
 become overwhelming for people.

22:40.880 --> 22:48.120
 And that tends to just obliterate one's capacity to capture any of it linguistically.

22:48.120 --> 22:52.440
 And as you're coming down, have you done psychedelics, have you ever done acid?

22:52.440 --> 23:00.760
 Not acid, mushroom, and that's it, and also edibles, but there's some psychedelic properties

23:00.760 --> 23:08.080
 to them, but mushrooms several times and always had an incredible experience.

23:08.080 --> 23:14.120
 Exactly the kind of experience you're referring to, which is if it's true that language constrains

23:14.120 --> 23:19.800
 our experience, it felt like I was removing some of the constraints.

23:19.800 --> 23:24.200
 Because even just the most basic things were beautiful in the way that I wasn't able to

23:24.200 --> 23:28.200
 appreciate previously, like trees and nature and so on.

23:28.200 --> 23:39.920
 And the experience of coming down is an experience of encountering the futility of capturing

23:39.920 --> 23:47.600
 what you just saw a moment ago in words, especially if you have any part of your self concept

23:47.600 --> 23:51.920
 and your ego program is to be able to capture things in words.

23:51.920 --> 23:58.160
 And if you're a writer or a poet or a scientist or someone who wants to just encapsulate

23:58.160 --> 24:08.920
 the profundity of what just happened, the total fatuousness of that enterprise when

24:08.920 --> 24:18.800
 you have taken a whopping dose of psychedelics and you begin to even gesture at describing

24:18.800 --> 24:26.040
 it to yourself so that you could describe it to others, it's like trying to thread a

24:26.040 --> 24:27.400
 needle using your elbows.

24:27.400 --> 24:35.200
 I mean, it's like you're trying something, it's like the mere gesture proves its impossibility.

24:35.200 --> 24:44.200
 And for me, that suggests just empirically on the first person side that it's possible

24:44.200 --> 24:51.320
 to put yourself in a condition where it's clearly not about language structuring your

24:51.320 --> 24:56.640
 experience and you're having much more experience than you tend to.

24:56.640 --> 25:06.600
 So the language is primary for some things, but it's certainly primary for certain kinds

25:06.600 --> 25:14.000
 of concepts and certain kinds of semantic understandings of the world, but it's clearly

25:14.000 --> 25:19.560
 more to mind than the conversation we're having with ourselves or that we can't have with

25:19.560 --> 25:20.560
 others.

25:20.560 --> 25:27.320
 Can we go to that world of psychedelics for a bit?

25:27.320 --> 25:29.320
 What do you think?

25:29.320 --> 25:38.280
 So Joe Rogan apparently and many others meet apparently elves when they on DMT.

25:38.280 --> 25:41.760
 A lot of people report this kind of creatures that they see.

25:41.760 --> 25:45.560
 And again, it's probably the failure of language to describe that experience, but DMT is an

25:45.560 --> 25:51.960
 interesting one, there's, as you're aware, there's a bunch of studies going on and psychedelics

25:51.960 --> 26:04.400
 currently in DMA, so Simon and John Hopkins and much other places, but DMT they all speak

26:04.400 --> 26:09.480
 of as like some extra super level of a psychedelic.

26:09.480 --> 26:19.680
 Yeah, do you have a sense of where it is our mind goes on psychedelics, but in DMT especially?

26:19.680 --> 26:23.120
 Well, unfortunately, I haven't taken DMT.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.120
 Unfortunately or fortunately?

26:24.120 --> 26:25.120
 Unfortunately.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.120
 Unfortunately.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.120
 Unfortunately.

26:27.120 --> 26:32.160
 Although it's, I presume it's in my body as it is in everyone's brain and many, many

26:32.160 --> 26:39.040
 plants apparently, but I've wanted to take, I haven't had an opportunity that was presented

26:39.040 --> 26:43.560
 itself that where it was obviously the right thing for me to be doing.

26:43.560 --> 26:49.520
 But for those who don't know, DMT is often touted as the most intense psychedelic and

26:49.520 --> 26:51.760
 also the shortest acting.

26:51.760 --> 26:57.520
 You smoke it and it's basically a 10 minute experience or a three minute experience within

26:57.520 --> 27:06.840
 like a 10 minute window that when you're really down after 10 minutes or so.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.560
 And Terrence McKenna was a big proponent of DMT.

27:09.560 --> 27:15.640
 That was his, you know, the center of the bullseye for him psychedelically apparently.

27:15.640 --> 27:21.280
 And it does, it is characterized, it seems for many people by this phenomenon, which

27:21.280 --> 27:27.200
 is, which is unlike virtually any other psychedelic experience, which is your, it's not just your

27:27.200 --> 27:31.040
 perception being broadened or changed.

27:31.040 --> 27:40.160
 It's you, according to Terrence McKenna, feeling fairly unchanged, but catapulted into a different

27:40.160 --> 27:41.160
 circumstance.

27:41.160 --> 27:48.360
 You have been shot elsewhere and find yourself in relationship to other entities of some

27:48.360 --> 27:49.360
 kind.

27:49.360 --> 27:54.240
 So the place is populated with things that seem not to be your mind.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.880
 So it does feel like travel to another place because you're unchanged yourself.

27:57.880 --> 28:03.480
 Again, I just have this on the authority of the people who have described their experience.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.980
 But it sounds like it's pretty common, it sounds like it's pretty common for people

28:06.980 --> 28:11.680
 not to have the full experience because it's apparently pretty unpleasant to smoke.

28:11.680 --> 28:18.840
 So it's like getting enough on board in order to get shot out of the cannon and land among

28:18.840 --> 28:29.760
 the what McKenna called self transforming machine elves that appeared to him like jeweled, you

28:29.760 --> 28:37.360
 know, Faberge egg, like self drippling basketballs that were handing him completely uninterpretable

28:37.360 --> 28:41.560
 reams of profound knowledge.

28:41.560 --> 28:48.800
 It's an experience I haven't had, so I just have to accept that people have had it.

28:48.800 --> 28:57.520
 I would just point out that our minds are clearly capable of producing apparent others

28:57.520 --> 29:02.520
 on demand that are totally compelling to us, right?

29:02.520 --> 29:07.440
 There's no limit to our ability to do that as anyone who's ever remembered a dream can

29:07.440 --> 29:08.440
 attest.

29:08.440 --> 29:14.200
 Every night we go to sleep, some of us don't remember dreams very often, but some dream

29:14.200 --> 29:20.920
 vividly every night and just think of how insane that experience is.

29:20.920 --> 29:24.120
 I mean, you've forgotten where you were, right?

29:24.120 --> 29:28.080
 That's the strangest part, I mean, this is psychosis, right?

29:28.080 --> 29:35.160
 You have lost your mind, you have lost your connection to your episodic memory or even

29:35.160 --> 29:43.640
 your expectations that reality won't undergo wholesale changes a moment after you have

29:43.640 --> 29:44.960
 closed your eyes, right?

29:44.960 --> 29:50.680
 Like you're in bed, you're watching something on Netflix, you're waiting to fall asleep,

29:50.680 --> 29:56.280
 and then the next thing that happens to you is impossible and you're not surprised, right?

29:56.280 --> 30:01.720
 You're talking to dead people, you're hanging out with famous people, you're someplace you

30:01.720 --> 30:06.880
 couldn't physically be, you can fly, and even that's not surprising, right?

30:06.880 --> 30:10.840
 You have lost your mind, but relevantly for this...

30:10.840 --> 30:12.200
 Or found it.

30:12.200 --> 30:16.080
 You found something, I mean, lucid dreaming is very interesting because then you can have

30:16.080 --> 30:22.280
 the best of both circumstances and then it can become systematically explored.

30:22.280 --> 30:28.600
 But what I mean by found just to start to interrupt is like if we take this brilliant

30:28.600 --> 30:34.280
 idea that language constrains us, grounds us, language and other things of the waking

30:34.280 --> 30:42.160
 world ground us, maybe it is that you've found the full capacity of your cognition.

30:42.160 --> 30:46.840
 When you dream or when you do psychedelics, you're stepping outside the little human

30:46.840 --> 30:52.840
 cage, the cage of the human condition, open the door and step out and look around and

30:52.840 --> 30:53.840
 then go back in.

30:53.840 --> 30:58.320
 Well, you've definitely stepped out of something and into something else, but you've also

30:58.320 --> 30:59.480
 lost something, right?

30:59.480 --> 31:00.800
 You've lost certain capacities.

31:00.800 --> 31:01.800
 Memory.

31:01.800 --> 31:02.800
 That you want.

31:02.800 --> 31:07.520
 Well, just, yeah, in this case, you literally didn't, you don't have enough presence of

31:07.520 --> 31:12.080
 mind in the dreamy, in the dreamy city or even in the psychedelic state, if you take

31:12.080 --> 31:13.080
 enough.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.160
 To do math.

31:16.160 --> 31:21.960
 There's no psychological, there's very little psychological continuity with your life such

31:21.960 --> 31:29.360
 that you're not surprised to be in the presence of someone who should be, you should know

31:29.360 --> 31:34.000
 is dead or you should know you're not likely to have met by normal channels, right?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
 Yeah.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.200
 You're now talking to some celebrity and it turns out you're best friends, right?

31:39.200 --> 31:42.120
 And you're not even, you have no memory of how you got there, you know, like how did

31:42.120 --> 31:43.120
 you get into the room?

31:43.120 --> 31:44.800
 You're like, did you drive to this restaurant?

31:44.800 --> 31:47.560
 You know, you have no memory and none of that's surprising to you.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.800
 So you're kind of brain damaged in a way.

31:49.800 --> 31:53.480
 You're not reality testing in the normal way.

31:53.480 --> 31:58.240
 The fascinating possibility is that there's probably thousands of people who've taken

31:58.240 --> 32:03.160
 psychedelics of various forms and have met Sam Harris on that journey.

32:03.160 --> 32:08.120
 Well, I would put it more likely in dreams, not, you know, because in psychedelics, you

32:08.120 --> 32:11.520
 don't tend to hallucinate in a dreamlike way.

32:11.520 --> 32:18.840
 I mean, so DMT is giving you an experience of others, but it seems to be nonstandard.

32:18.840 --> 32:24.040
 It's not like, it's not just like dream hallucinations.

32:24.040 --> 32:31.160
 But to the point of coming back to DMT, the people want to suggest, and Terence McKenna

32:31.160 --> 32:38.040
 certainly did suggest that because these others are so obviously other and they're so vivid,

32:38.040 --> 32:43.000
 well, then they could not possibly be the creation of my own mind.

32:43.000 --> 32:51.080
 But every night in dreams, you create a compelling or what is to you at the time, a totally compelling

32:51.080 --> 33:00.920
 simulacrum of another person, right, and that's, that just proves the mind is capable of doing

33:00.920 --> 33:01.920
 it.

33:01.920 --> 33:07.120
 Now, the phenomenon of lucid dreaming shows that the mind isn't capable of doing everything

33:07.120 --> 33:10.120
 you think it might be capable of even in that space.

33:10.120 --> 33:16.800
 So one of the things that people have discovered in lucid dreams, and I haven't done a lot

33:16.800 --> 33:17.800
 of lucid dreaming.

33:17.800 --> 33:24.920
 I can't confirm all of this, so I can confirm some of it.

33:24.920 --> 33:31.480
 Apparently in every house, in every room in the mansion of dreams, all light switches

33:31.480 --> 33:32.600
 are dimmer switches.

33:32.600 --> 33:37.960
 Like, if you go into a dark room and flip on the light, it gradually comes up.

33:37.960 --> 33:44.560
 It doesn't come up instantly on demand because apparently this is covering for the brain's

33:44.560 --> 33:52.160
 inability to produce from a standing start visually rich imagery on demand.

33:52.160 --> 33:58.120
 So I haven't confirmed that, but people have done research on lucid dreaming claim that

33:58.120 --> 34:01.440
 it's all dimmer switches.

34:01.440 --> 34:08.760
 But one thing I have noticed, and people can check this out, is that in a dream, if you

34:08.760 --> 34:17.160
 look at a page of text, or a sign, or a television that has text on it, and then you turn away

34:17.160 --> 34:20.600
 and you look back at that text, the text will have changed.

34:20.600 --> 34:29.200
 The total is just a chronic instability, graphical instability of text in the dream state.

34:29.200 --> 34:33.280
 And I don't know if that, maybe that's, someone can confirm that that's not true for them,

34:33.280 --> 34:35.760
 but whenever I've checked that out, that has been true for me.

34:35.760 --> 34:40.640
 It keeps generating it like real time from a video game perspective.

34:40.640 --> 34:44.920
 Yeah, it's rendering, it's re rendering it for some reason.

34:44.920 --> 34:50.400
 What's interesting, I actually, I don't know how I found myself in this sets of that part

34:50.400 --> 34:55.200
 of the internet, but there's quite a lot of discussion about what it's like to do math

34:55.200 --> 34:57.640
 on LSD.

34:57.640 --> 35:04.600
 Because apparently, one of the deepest thinking processes needed is those of mathematicians

35:04.600 --> 35:09.960
 or theoretical computer scientists, basically doing anything that involves math is proofs,

35:09.960 --> 35:14.440
 and you have to think creatively, but also deeply, and you have to think for many hours

35:14.440 --> 35:15.960
 at a time.

35:15.960 --> 35:21.200
 And so they're always looking for ways to, like, is there, is there any sparks of creativity

35:21.200 --> 35:27.600
 that could be injected, and apparently, out of all the psychedelics, the worst is LSD,

35:27.600 --> 35:30.840
 because it completely destroys your ability to do math well.

35:30.840 --> 35:37.640
 And I wonder whether that has to do with your ability to visualize geometric things in a

35:37.640 --> 35:42.120
 stable way in your mind and hold them there and stitch things together, which is often

35:42.120 --> 35:44.240
 what's required for proofs.

35:44.240 --> 35:49.480
 But again, it's difficult to kind of research these kinds of concepts, but it does make

35:49.480 --> 35:57.440
 me wonder where, what are the spaces, how's the space of things you're able to think about

35:57.440 --> 36:05.200
 and explore, morphed by different, by different psychedelics or dream states and so on, and

36:05.200 --> 36:06.200
 how is that different?

36:06.200 --> 36:08.280
 How much does it overlap with reality?

36:08.280 --> 36:10.520
 And what is fundamental, what is reality?

36:10.520 --> 36:16.240
 Is there a waking state reality, or is it just a tiny subset of reality, and we get

36:16.240 --> 36:19.200
 to take a step in other versions of it?

36:19.200 --> 36:25.400
 We tend to think very much in a space time, four dimensional, there's a three dimensional

36:25.400 --> 36:29.760
 world, there's time, and that's what we think about reality.

36:29.760 --> 36:35.640
 And we think of traveling as walking from point A to point B in the three dimensional

36:35.640 --> 36:42.360
 world, but that's a very kind of human surviving, try not to get eaten by a lion conception

36:42.360 --> 36:43.520
 of reality.

36:43.520 --> 36:48.440
 What if traveling is something like we do with psychedelics and meet the elves?

36:48.440 --> 36:53.920
 What if it's something, what if thinking or the space of ideas as we kind of grow and

36:53.920 --> 36:57.840
 think through ideas, that's traveling?

36:57.840 --> 37:00.360
 Or what if memories is traveling?

37:00.360 --> 37:06.320
 I don't know if you have a favorite view of reality, or if you had, by the way, I should

37:06.320 --> 37:10.960
 say an excellent conversation with Donald Hoffman.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.120
 Yeah, he's interesting.

37:12.120 --> 37:20.600
 Is there any inkling of his sense in your mind that reality is very far from, actual

37:20.600 --> 37:25.840
 like objective reality is very far from the kind of reality we imagine we perceive and

37:25.840 --> 37:29.520
 we play with in our human minds?

37:29.520 --> 37:39.920
 Well, the first thing to grant is that we're never in direct contact with reality, whatever

37:39.920 --> 37:42.760
 it is, unless that reality is consciousness.

37:42.760 --> 37:48.840
 So we're only ever experiencing consciousness and its contents.

37:48.840 --> 37:56.120
 And then the question is, how does that circumstance relate to, quote, reality at large?

37:56.120 --> 38:02.200
 And Donald Hoffman is somebody who's happy to speculate, well, maybe there isn't a reality

38:02.200 --> 38:03.200
 at large.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.920
 Maybe it's all just consciousness on some level.

38:05.920 --> 38:08.480
 And that's interesting.

38:08.480 --> 38:17.200
 That runs into, to my eye, various philosophical problems that, or at least you have to do

38:17.200 --> 38:26.640
 a lot, you have to add to that picture, picture of idealism, that's usually all the whole

38:26.640 --> 38:31.960
 family of views that would just say that the universe is just mind or just consciousness

38:31.960 --> 38:38.400
 at bottom will go by the name of idealism in Western philosophy.

38:38.400 --> 38:44.840
 You have to add to that idealistic picture, all kinds of epicycles and kind of weird coincidences

38:44.840 --> 38:54.480
 and to get the predictability of our experience and the success of materialist science to

38:54.480 --> 38:56.240
 make sense in that context.

38:56.240 --> 39:03.720
 So the fact that we can, what does it mean to say that there's only consciousness at

39:03.720 --> 39:08.560
 bottom, nothing outside of consciousness, because no one's ever experienced anything

39:08.560 --> 39:09.560
 outside of consciousness?

39:09.560 --> 39:15.120
 Because no scientist has ever done an experiment where they were contemplating data, no matter

39:15.120 --> 39:20.560
 how far removed from our sense bases, whether it's they're looking at the Hubble deep field

39:20.560 --> 39:28.240
 or they're smashing atoms or whatever tools they're using, they're still just experiencing

39:28.240 --> 39:37.400
 consciousness and its various deliverances and layering their concepts on top of that.

39:37.400 --> 39:41.680
 So that's always true.

39:41.680 --> 39:54.000
 And yet that somehow doesn't seem to capture the character of our continually discovering

39:54.000 --> 39:59.040
 that our materialist assumptions are confirmable.

39:59.040 --> 40:06.640
 So take the fact that we unleash this fantastic amount of energy from within an atom.

40:06.640 --> 40:14.240
 First we have the theoretical suggestion that it's possible to come back to Einstein, there's

40:14.240 --> 40:21.160
 a lot of energy in that matter, and what if we could release it?

40:21.160 --> 40:28.520
 And then we perform an experiment that in this case, the Trinity test site in New Mexico

40:28.520 --> 40:36.840
 where the people who are most adequate to this conversation, people like Robert Oppenheimer

40:36.840 --> 40:41.040
 are standing around, not altogether certain it's going to work, right?

40:41.040 --> 40:43.240
 They're performing an experiment, they're wondering what's going to happen, they're

40:43.240 --> 40:47.840
 wondering if their calculations around the yield are off by orders of magnitude.

40:47.840 --> 40:54.480
 Some of them are still wondering whether the entire atmosphere of Earth is going to combust,

40:54.480 --> 41:01.520
 right, that the nuclear chain reaction is not going to stop.

41:01.520 --> 41:08.880
 And lo and behold, there was that energy to be released from within the nucleus of an

41:08.880 --> 41:20.440
 atom and that could, so it's just what the picture one forms from those kinds of experiments

41:20.440 --> 41:24.840
 and just the knowledge is just our understanding of evolution, just the fact that the Earth

41:24.840 --> 41:29.360
 is billions of years old and life is hundreds of millions of years old and we weren't here

41:29.360 --> 41:33.760
 to think about any of those things and all of those processes were happening therefore

41:33.760 --> 41:40.400
 in the dark and they are the processes that allowed us to emerge from prior life forms

41:40.400 --> 41:47.940
 in the first place to say that nothing exists outside of consciousness, conscious minds

41:47.940 --> 42:01.080
 of the sort that we experience, it just seems like a bizarrely anthropocentric claim, you

42:01.080 --> 42:05.720
 know, analogous to, you know, the moon isn't there if no one's looking at it, right?

42:05.720 --> 42:10.280
 The moon as a moon isn't there if no one's looking at it, I'll grant that because that's

42:10.280 --> 42:17.200
 already a kind of fabrication born of concepts, but the idea that there's nothing there,

42:17.200 --> 42:22.360
 that there's nothing that corresponds to what we experience as the moon unless someone's

42:22.360 --> 42:30.380
 looking at it, that just seems just a way too parochial way to set out on this journey

42:30.380 --> 42:31.380
 of discovery.

42:31.380 --> 42:34.800
 There is something there, there's a computer waiting to render the moon when you look at

42:34.800 --> 42:42.520
 it, that the capacity for the moon to exist is there, so if we're indeed living in a simulation

42:42.520 --> 42:48.120
 which I find a compelling thought experiment, it's possible that there is a kind of rendering

42:48.120 --> 42:53.040
 mechanism, but not in a silly way that we think about in video games, but in some kind

42:53.040 --> 42:55.680
 of more fundamental physics way.

42:55.680 --> 43:04.200
 And we have to account for the fact that it renders experiences that no one has had yet,

43:04.200 --> 43:09.280
 that no one has any expectation of having, it can violate the expectations of everyone

43:09.280 --> 43:17.560
 lawfully and then there's some lawful understanding of why that's so, it's like to bring it back

43:17.560 --> 43:23.440
 to mathematics, certain numbers are prime whether we have discovered them or not, there's

43:23.440 --> 43:29.080
 the highest prime number that anyone can name now, and then there's the next prime number

43:29.080 --> 43:36.000
 that no one can name and it's there, so it's like it's to say that our minds are putting

43:36.000 --> 43:43.400
 it there, that what we know as mind in ourselves is in some way, in some sense putting it there,

43:43.400 --> 43:49.680
 the base layer of reality is consciousness, that we're identical to the thing that is

43:49.680 --> 43:53.360
 rendering this reality.

43:53.360 --> 44:02.040
 There's some, hubris is the wrong word, but it's okay if reality is bigger than what

44:02.040 --> 44:15.440
 we experience and has structure that we can't anticipate and that isn't just, again, there's

44:15.440 --> 44:20.680
 certainly a collaboration between our minds and whatever's out there to produce what we

44:20.680 --> 44:31.800
 call the stuff of life, but it's not, the idea that it's, I don't know, I mean there

44:31.800 --> 44:39.400
 are a few stops on the train of idealism and kind of new age thinking and Eastern philosophy

44:39.400 --> 44:44.320
 that I don't, philosophically I don't see a need to take, I mean the plays experientially

44:44.320 --> 44:53.480
 and scientifically, I feel like you can get everything you want acknowledging that consciousness

44:53.480 --> 44:59.960
 has a character that can be explored from its own side, so that you're bringing kind

44:59.960 --> 45:05.760
 of the first person experience back into the conversation about what is a human mind and

45:05.760 --> 45:12.880
 what is true, and you can explore it with different degrees of rigor and there are things

45:12.880 --> 45:16.960
 to be discovered there, whether you're using a technique like meditation or psychedelics,

45:16.960 --> 45:22.720
 and that these experiences have to be put in conversation with what we understand about

45:22.720 --> 45:27.600
 ourselves from a third person side, neuroscientifically or in any other way.

45:27.600 --> 45:33.920
 But to me the question is, what if real, the sense I have from this kind of, you play

45:33.920 --> 45:34.920
 shooters?

45:34.920 --> 45:35.920
 No.

45:35.920 --> 45:39.560
 There's a physics engine that generates, that's probably, I have, you mean first person

45:39.560 --> 45:40.560
 shooter games?

45:40.560 --> 45:41.560
 Yes.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.560
 Sorry.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.560
 Not often, but yes.

45:43.560 --> 45:47.400
 I mean there's a physics engine that generates consistent reality, right?

45:47.400 --> 45:54.000
 My sense is the same could be true for a universe in the following sense that our conception

45:54.000 --> 45:59.400
 of reality, as we understand it now in the 21st century, is a tiny subset of the full

45:59.400 --> 46:00.400
 reality.

46:00.400 --> 46:05.320
 It's not that the reality that we conceive of that's there, the moon being there is not

46:05.320 --> 46:09.600
 there somehow, it's that it's a tiny fraction of what's actually out there.

46:09.600 --> 46:16.160
 And so the physics engine of the universe is just maintaining the useful physics, the

46:16.160 --> 46:22.960
 useful reality, quote unquote, for us to have a consistent experience as human beings, but

46:22.960 --> 46:32.440
 maybe we descendants of apes are really only understand like 0.0001% of actual physics

46:32.440 --> 46:38.520
 of reality, like this, we can even just start with the consciousness thing, but maybe our

46:38.520 --> 46:45.040
 minds are just, we're just too dumb by design.

46:45.040 --> 46:49.680
 That truly resonates with me and I'm surprised it doesn't resonate more with most scientists

46:49.680 --> 46:57.560
 that I talked to, when you just look at how close we are to chimps, right, and chimps

46:57.560 --> 47:01.640
 don't know anything, right, clearly they have no idea what's going on, right?

47:01.640 --> 47:08.520
 And then you get us, but then it's only a subset of human beings that really understand

47:08.520 --> 47:12.800
 much of what we're talking about in any area of specialization.

47:12.800 --> 47:19.120
 And if they all died in their sleep tonight, right, you'd be left with people who might

47:19.120 --> 47:25.240
 take a thousand years to rebuild the internet, you know, if ever, right, I mean, literally,

47:25.240 --> 47:30.880
 it's like, you know, and, you know, I would extend this to myself, I mean, there are areas

47:30.880 --> 47:38.200
 of scientific specialization where I have either no discernible competence, I mean,

47:38.200 --> 47:43.040
 I spend no time on it, I have not acquired the tools, it would just be an article of

47:43.040 --> 47:46.280
 faith for me to think that I could acquire the tools to actually make a breakthrough

47:46.280 --> 47:52.240
 in those areas, and I mean, you know, your own area is one, I mean, you know, I've never

47:52.240 --> 47:58.920
 spent any significant amount of time trying to be a programmer, but it's pretty obvious

47:58.920 --> 48:04.640
 I'm not Alan Turing, right, it's like, if that were my capacity, I would have discovered

48:04.640 --> 48:13.240
 that in myself, I would have found programming irresistible, my first fall starts in learning,

48:13.240 --> 48:18.320
 I think it was C, it was just, you know, I bounced off, it's like, this was not fun,

48:18.320 --> 48:22.680
 I hate, I mean, trying to figure out what, you know, the syntax error that's causing

48:22.680 --> 48:26.640
 this thing not to compile was just a fucking awful experience, I hated it, right, I hated

48:26.640 --> 48:35.360
 every minute of it, so it was not, so if it was just people like me left, like, when do

48:35.360 --> 48:40.720
 we get the internet again, right, and we lose, we lose, you know, we lose the internet, when

48:40.720 --> 48:46.640
 do we get it again, right, when do we get a, anything like a proper science of information,

48:46.640 --> 48:52.760
 right, you need a Claude Shannon, or an Alan Turing, just to plant a flag in the ground

48:52.760 --> 48:56.600
 right here and say, all right, can everyone see this, even if you don't quite know what

48:56.600 --> 49:04.320
 I'm up to, you all have to come over here to make some progress, and you know, there

49:04.320 --> 49:11.800
 are, you know, hundreds of topics where that's the case, so we're, we barely have a purchase

49:11.800 --> 49:22.400
 on making anything like discernible intellectual progress in any generation, and yeah, I'm,

49:22.400 --> 49:29.840
 just a, Max Tegmark makes this point, he's one of the few people who does in physics,

49:29.840 --> 49:39.520
 if you just take the truth of evolution seriously, right, and realize that there's nothing about

49:39.520 --> 49:44.360
 us that has evolved to understand reality perfectly, I mean, we're just not that kind

49:44.360 --> 49:49.120
 of ape, right, there's been no evolutionary pressure along those lines, so what we are

49:49.120 --> 49:58.040
 making do with tools that were designed for fights with sticks and rocks, right, and it's

49:58.040 --> 50:01.800
 amazing, we can do as much as we can, I mean, we just, you know, you and I are just sitting

50:01.800 --> 50:07.880
 here on the back of having received an mRNA vaccine, you know, that has certainly changed

50:07.880 --> 50:13.520
 our life, given what the last year was like, and it's going to change the world if rumors

50:13.520 --> 50:20.720
 of coming miracles are borne out, I mean, if it's now, seems likely we have a vaccine

50:20.720 --> 50:26.280
 coming for malaria, right, which has been killing millions of people a year for as long

50:26.280 --> 50:32.420
 as we've been alive, I think it's down to like 800,000 people a year now because we've

50:32.420 --> 50:39.480
 spread so many bed nets around, but it was like two and a half million people every year.

50:39.480 --> 50:46.400
 It's amazing what we can do, but yeah, I have, if in fact the answer at the back of the book

50:46.400 --> 50:53.120
 of nature is you understand 0.1% of what there is to understand and half of what you think

50:53.120 --> 50:57.640
 you understand is wrong, that would not surprise me at all.

50:57.640 --> 51:03.120
 It is funny to look at our evolutionary history, even back to chimps, I'm pretty sure even

51:03.120 --> 51:06.400
 chimps thought they understood the world well.

51:06.400 --> 51:13.000
 So at every point in that timeline of evolutionary development throughout human history, there's

51:13.000 --> 51:17.880
 a sense like there's no more, you hear this message over and over, there's no more things

51:17.880 --> 51:18.880
 to be invented.

51:18.880 --> 51:25.040
 But about 100 years ago, there was a famous story, I forget which physicists told it,

51:25.040 --> 51:33.680
 but there were physicists telling their undergraduate students not to go into, to get graduate degrees

51:33.680 --> 51:39.080
 in physics because basically all the problems had been solved, and this is like around 1915

51:39.080 --> 51:40.080
 or so.

51:40.080 --> 51:44.920
 It turns out you were right, I'm going to ask you about free will.

51:44.920 --> 51:50.240
 You've recently released an episode of your podcast, Making Sense, for those with a shorter

51:50.240 --> 51:53.960
 attention span, basically summarizing your position on free will.

51:53.960 --> 52:01.920
 I think it was under an hour and a half, as brief and clear.

52:01.920 --> 52:08.520
 So allow me to summarize the summary, TLDR, and maybe you tell me where I'm wrong.

52:08.520 --> 52:14.080
 So free will is an illusion, and even the experience of free will is an illusion, like

52:14.080 --> 52:18.000
 we don't even experience it.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.440
 Am I good in my summary?

52:20.440 --> 52:27.360
 Yeah, this is a line that's a little hard to scan for people.

52:27.360 --> 52:32.440
 I say that it's not merely that free will is an illusion.

52:32.440 --> 52:37.600
 The illusion of free will is an illusion, like there is no illusion of free will.

52:37.600 --> 52:47.160
 And that is a, unlike many other illusions, that's a more fundamental claim.

52:47.160 --> 52:49.440
 It's not that it's wrong, it's not even wrong.

52:49.440 --> 52:55.560
 I mean, that's, I guess, I think Wolfgang Pauley, who derided one of his colleagues

52:55.560 --> 53:07.000
 or enemies with that aspersion about his theory in quantum mechanics.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.880
 So there are things that you, there are genuine illusions.

53:09.880 --> 53:15.200
 There are things that you do experience, and then you can kind of punch through that experience.

53:15.200 --> 53:20.280
 Or you can't actually experience, you can't experience them any other way.

53:20.280 --> 53:23.920
 It's just, we just know it's not a veritical experience.

53:23.920 --> 53:25.440
 It's take like a visual illusion.

53:25.440 --> 53:28.400
 There are visual illusions that, you know, a lot of these come to me on Twitter these

53:28.400 --> 53:29.400
 days.

53:29.400 --> 53:34.960
 There's these amazing visual illusions, where like, you know, every figure in this gift

53:34.960 --> 53:37.720
 seems to be moving, but nothing in fact is moving.

53:37.720 --> 53:42.480
 You can just like put a ruler on your screen and nothing's moving.

53:42.480 --> 53:44.480
 Some of those illusions, you can't see any other way.

53:44.480 --> 53:49.240
 I mean, they're just, they're hacking aspects of the visual system that are just eminently

53:49.240 --> 53:50.240
 hackable.

53:50.240 --> 53:55.240
 And you, you know, you have to use a ruler to convince yourself that the thing isn't

53:55.240 --> 53:56.240
 actually moving.

53:56.240 --> 54:01.480
 Now, there are other visual illusions where you're taken in by it at first, but if you

54:01.480 --> 54:06.320
 pay more attention, you can actually see that it's not there, right, or it's not how it

54:06.320 --> 54:07.320
 first seemed.

54:07.320 --> 54:10.240
 Like the, like the necker cube is a good example of that.

54:10.240 --> 54:14.840
 Like the necker cube is just that schematic of a cube, of a transparent cube, which pops

54:14.840 --> 54:19.000
 out one way or the other, the one, one face can pop out and the other face can pop out.

54:19.000 --> 54:24.960
 But you can actually just see it as flat with no pop out, which is a more veritical way

54:24.960 --> 54:28.080
 of looking at it.

54:28.080 --> 54:32.680
 So there are subject, there are kind of inward correlates to this.

54:32.680 --> 54:40.160
 And I would say that the, the sense of self, the sense of self and free will are closely

54:40.160 --> 54:41.160
 related.

54:41.160 --> 54:45.080
 I'm often described them as, as two sides of the same coin, but they're not quite the

54:45.080 --> 54:49.080
 same in the, their, their spuriousness.

54:49.080 --> 54:54.680
 I mean, so the sense of self is something that people, I think, do experience, right?

54:54.680 --> 54:59.800
 It's not a very clear experience, but it's not, I wouldn't call the illusion of self

54:59.800 --> 55:05.360
 and illusion, but the illusion of free will is an illusion in that as you pay more attention

55:05.360 --> 55:11.280
 to your experience, you begin to see that it's totally compatible with an absence of

55:11.280 --> 55:12.280
 free will.

55:12.280 --> 55:16.040
 You don't, I mean, come into back to the place we started.

55:16.040 --> 55:18.560
 You don't know what you're going to think next.

55:18.560 --> 55:20.440
 You don't know what you're going to intend next.

55:20.440 --> 55:24.600
 You don't know what's going to just occur to you that you must do next.

55:24.600 --> 55:29.480
 You don't know, you don't know how much you were going to feel the behavioral imperative

55:29.480 --> 55:31.760
 to act on that thought.

55:31.760 --> 55:35.120
 If you suddenly feel, oh, I don't need to do that.

55:35.120 --> 55:36.840
 That's, I can do that tomorrow.

55:36.840 --> 55:38.160
 You don't know where that comes from.

55:38.160 --> 55:39.680
 You didn't know that was going to arise.

55:39.680 --> 55:41.840
 You didn't know that was going to be compelling.

55:41.840 --> 55:47.160
 All of this is compatible with some evil genius in the next room, just typing in code into

55:47.160 --> 55:48.160
 your experience.

55:48.160 --> 55:53.240
 It's like this, okay, let's give him the, oh my God, I just forgot it was going to be

55:53.240 --> 55:56.200
 our anniversary in one week thought, right?

55:56.200 --> 55:59.720
 Give him the cascade of fear.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.480
 Give him this brilliant idea for the thing he can buy that's going to take him no time

56:02.480 --> 56:05.480
 at all in this, you know, overpowering sense of relief.

56:05.480 --> 56:11.760
 All of our experiences is compatible with the script already being written, right?

56:11.760 --> 56:12.920
 And I'm not saying the script is written.

56:12.920 --> 56:18.480
 I'm not saying that fatalism is, you know, is the right way to look at this.

56:18.480 --> 56:24.880
 But we just don't have even our most deliberate voluntary action where we go back and forth

56:24.880 --> 56:29.760
 between two options, you know, thinking about the reason for A and then, then reconsidering

56:29.760 --> 56:36.520
 and going, thinking harder about B and just going any, many, many mo until the end of

56:36.520 --> 56:45.080
 the hour, however laborious you can make it, there is a utter mystery at your back, finally

56:45.080 --> 56:54.240
 promoting the thought or intention or ration, rationale that is most compelling and therefore

56:54.240 --> 57:09.240
 deliberate, behaviorally effective and just, and this can drive some people a little crazy.

57:09.240 --> 57:15.320
 So, you know, I usually preface what I say about free will with the caveat that if thinking

57:15.320 --> 57:20.720
 about your mind this way makes you feel terrible, well, then stop, you know, get off the ride,

57:20.720 --> 57:24.840
 you know, switch the channel, you don't have to go down this path.

57:24.840 --> 57:31.720
 But for me and for many other people, it's incredibly freeing to recognize this about

57:31.720 --> 57:39.200
 the mind because one, you realize that you're cutting through the illusion of the, you know,

57:39.200 --> 57:44.200
 of the self as immensely freeing for a lot of reasons that we can talk about separately.

57:44.200 --> 57:51.800
 But losing the sense of free will does two things very vividly for me.

57:51.800 --> 57:56.800
 One is it totally undercuts the basis for, the psychological basis for hatred, right?

57:56.800 --> 58:02.240
 Because when you think about the experience of hating other people, what that is anchored

58:02.240 --> 58:08.400
 to is a feeling that they really are the true authors of their actions.

58:08.400 --> 58:12.880
 I mean, that someone is doing something that you find so despicable, right?

58:12.880 --> 58:17.320
 And let's say they're, you know, targeting you unfairly, right, they're maligning you

58:17.320 --> 58:22.120
 on Twitter or they're, you know, they're suing you or they're doing something, they broke

58:22.120 --> 58:26.800
 your car window, they did something awful, and now you have a grievance against them.

58:26.800 --> 58:32.320
 And you're relating to them very differently, emotionally, in your own mind than you would

58:32.320 --> 58:34.560
 if a force of nature had done this, right?

58:34.560 --> 58:40.400
 Or if it's if it just been, you know, a virus or if it had been a wild animal or a malfunctioning

58:40.400 --> 58:41.400
 machine, right?

58:41.400 --> 58:44.360
 Like to those things, you don't attribute any kind of freedom of will.

58:44.360 --> 58:49.200
 And while you may suffer the consequences of catching a virus or being attacked by a

58:49.200 --> 58:56.120
 wild animal or having a, you know, your car break down or whatever, it may frustrate you.

58:56.120 --> 59:04.640
 You don't slip into this mode of hating the agent in a way that completely commandeers

59:04.640 --> 59:07.760
 your, your mind and deranges your life.

59:07.760 --> 59:13.240
 I mean, you just don't, I mean, there are people who spend decades hating other people

59:13.240 --> 59:16.040
 for what they did.

59:16.040 --> 59:18.160
 And it's, it's just pure poison.

59:18.160 --> 59:19.160
 Right.

59:19.160 --> 59:21.040
 It's a useful shortcut to compassion and empathy.

59:21.040 --> 59:22.040
 Yeah.

59:22.040 --> 59:23.040
 Yeah.

59:23.040 --> 59:26.880
 Let's say that this call, what was it, the horse of consciousness?

59:26.880 --> 59:32.920
 Let's call it the, the consciousness generator black box that we don't understand.

59:32.920 --> 59:40.920
 And is it possible that the script that we're walking along, that we're playing that's

59:40.920 --> 59:44.760
 already written is actually being written in real time.

59:44.760 --> 59:51.000
 It's almost like you're driving down a road and in real time that road is being laid down.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.520
 And this black box of consciousness that we don't understand is the place where the script

59:55.520 --> 59:57.160
 is being generated.

59:57.160 --> 59:59.640
 So it's not, it is being generated.

59:59.640 --> 1:00:01.280
 It didn't always exist.

1:00:01.280 --> 1:00:05.640
 So there's something we don't understand that's fundamental about the nature of reality that

1:00:05.640 --> 1:00:07.680
 generates both consciousness.

1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:09.840
 Let's call it maybe the self.

1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:11.720
 I don't know if you want to distinguish between those.

1:00:11.720 --> 1:00:12.720
 Yeah, I definitely would.

1:00:12.720 --> 1:00:13.720
 Yeah.

1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:16.480
 You would, because there's a bunch of illusions we're referring to.

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:18.560
 There's the illusion of free will.

1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:22.640
 There's the illusion of self and there's the illusion of consciousness.

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:27.680
 You're saying, I think you said there's no, you're not as willing to say there's an illusion

1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:28.680
 of consciousness.

1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:30.960
 In fact, I would say it's impossible.

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:31.960
 Impossible.

1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:36.480
 You're a little bit more willing to say that there's an illusion of self and you're definitely

1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:38.680
 saying there's an illusion of free will.

1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:39.680
 Yes.

1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:40.680
 Yes.

1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:44.240
 I'm definitely saying there's an illusion that a certain kind of self is an illusion.

1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:48.080
 Not every, we mean many different things by this notion of self.

1:00:48.080 --> 1:00:51.680
 Maybe I should just differentiate these things.

1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:58.400
 Consciousness can't be an illusion because any illusion proves its reality as much as

1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:00.120
 any other veridical perception.

1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:05.600
 I mean, if you're hallucinating now, that's just as much of a demonstration of consciousness

1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:10.240
 as really seeing what's a quote actually there.

1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:15.560
 If you're dreaming and you don't know it, that is consciousness.

1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:18.320
 You can be confused about literally everything.

1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:26.360
 You can't be confused about the underlying claim, whether you make it linguistically or

1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:37.040
 not, but just the cognitive assertion that something seems to be happening.

1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:39.960
 It's the seeming that is the cash value of consciousness.

1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:42.440
 Can I take a tiny tangent?

1:01:42.440 --> 1:01:43.440
 Okay.

1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:50.840
 I am creating consciousness in my mind to convince you that I'm human, so it's a useful

1:01:50.840 --> 1:02:00.840
 social tool, not a fundamental property of experience, like of being a living thing.

1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:08.840
 What if it's just like a social tool to almost like a useful computational trick to place

1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:14.600
 myself into reality as we together communicate about this reality?

1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:19.840
 Another way to ask that, because you said it much earlier, you talk negatively about

1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:26.880
 robots as you often do, so you'll probably die first when they take over.

1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:30.160
 I'm looking forward to certain kinds of robots.

1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:32.200
 If we can get this right, this would be amazing.

1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:34.520
 You don't like the robots that fake consciousness.

1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:38.280
 You don't like the idea of fake it until you make it.

1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:43.760
 No, it's not that I don't like it, it's that I'm worried that we will lose sight of the

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:48.040
 problem and the problem has massive ethical consequences.

1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:54.080
 If we create robots that really can suffer, that would be a bad thing.

1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:59.120
 If we really are committing a murder when we recycle them, that would be a bad thing.

1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:00.360
 This is how I know you're not Russian.

1:03:00.360 --> 1:03:03.080
 Why is it a bad thing that we create robots that can suffer?

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:08.080
 Isn't suffering a fundamental thing from which beauty springs?

1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:13.080
 Without suffering, do you really think we would have beautiful things in this world?

1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:14.720
 That's a tangent on a tangent.

1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:15.720
 We'll go there.

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:17.920
 I would love to go there, but let's not go there just yet.

1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:24.520
 I do think it would be, if anything is bad, creating hell and populating it with real

1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:31.120
 minds that really can suffer in that hell, that's bad.

1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:36.080
 You are worse than any mass murderer we can name if you create it.

1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:41.360
 This could be in robot form or more likely it would be in some simulation of a world

1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:45.160
 where we managed to populate it with conscious minds so that whether we knew they were conscious

1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:50.680
 or not and that world is a state of, it's unendurable.

1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:58.360
 That would just, taking the thesis seriously that there's nothing, that mind, intelligence

1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:00.560
 and consciousness ultimately are substrate independent.

1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:03.400
 You don't need a biological brain to be conscious.

1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:06.800
 You certainly don't need a biological brain to be intelligent.

1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:10.560
 If we just imagine that consciousness at some point comes along for the ride as you scale

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:16.160
 up in intelligence, well then we could find ourselves creating conscious minds that are

1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:20.080
 miserable and that's just like creating a person who's miserable.

1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:23.040
 It could be worse than creating a person who's miserable, it could be even more sensitive

1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:24.040
 to suffering.

1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:28.120
 Cloning them and maybe for entertainment watching them suffer.

1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:33.080
 Just like watching a person suffer for entertainment.

1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:40.600
 But back to your primary question here which is differentiating consciousness and self and

1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:46.800
 free will as concepts and kind of degrees of illusoriness.

1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:56.040
 The problem with free will is that what most people mean by it and this is where Dan Dennett

1:04:56.040 --> 1:05:01.280
 is going to get off the ride here, so he's going to disagree with me that I know what

1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:03.080
 most people mean by it.

1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:10.920
 I have a very keen sense, having talked about this topic for many, many years and seeing

1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:17.920
 people get wrapped around the axle of it and seeing in myself what it's like to have felt

1:05:17.920 --> 1:05:22.640
 that I was a self that had free will and then to no longer feel that way, to know what it's

1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:30.960
 like to actually disabuse myself of that sense cognitively and emotionally and to recognize

1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:37.040
 what's left, what goes away and what doesn't go away on the basis of that epiphany.

1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:42.200
 I have a sense that I know what people think they have in hand when they worry about whether

1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:50.760
 free will exists and it is the flip side of this feeling of self, it's the flip side

1:05:50.760 --> 1:05:58.160
 of feeling like you are not merely identical to experience, you feel like you're having

1:05:58.160 --> 1:06:02.320
 an experience, you feel like you're an agent that is appropriating an experience.

1:06:02.320 --> 1:06:11.640
 There's a protagonist in the movie of your life and it is you, it's not just the movie.

1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:17.000
 There's sights and sounds and sensations and thoughts and emotions and this whole cacophony

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:22.040
 of experience, of felt experience, of felt experience of embodiment, but there seems

1:06:22.040 --> 1:06:28.520
 to be a rider on the horse or a passenger in the body.

1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:32.840
 People don't feel truly identical to their bodies down to their toes.

1:06:32.840 --> 1:06:37.720
 They sort of feel like they have bodies, they feel like their minds in bodies and that feels

1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:46.680
 like a self, that feels like me and again this gets very paradoxical when you talk about

1:06:46.680 --> 1:06:51.720
 the experience of being in relationship to yourself or talking to yourself, giving yourself

1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:52.720
 a pep talk.

1:06:52.720 --> 1:06:56.000
 I mean, if you're the one talking, why are you also the one listening?

1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:00.680
 Why do you need the pep talk and why does it work if you're the one giving the pep talk?

1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:06.680
 Or if I'm looking for my keys, why do I think the superfluous thought, where are my keys?

1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:12.160
 I know I'm looking for the fucking keys, I'm the one looking, who am I telling that we

1:07:12.160 --> 1:07:13.920
 now need to look for the keys?

1:07:13.920 --> 1:07:17.800
 So that duality is weird, but leave that aside.

1:07:17.800 --> 1:07:25.520
 There's this sense, and this becomes very vivid when people try to learn to meditate.

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:30.920
 Most people, they close their eyes and they're told to pay attention to an object like the

1:07:30.920 --> 1:07:31.920
 breath.

1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:36.560
 So you close your eyes and you pay attention to the breath and you can feel it at the tip

1:07:36.560 --> 1:07:42.280
 of your nose or the rising and falling of your abdomen and you're paying attention and

1:07:42.280 --> 1:07:46.960
 you feel something vague there and then you think, why the breath?

1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:50.080
 Why am I paying attention to the breath?

1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:51.880
 What's so special about the breath?

1:07:51.880 --> 1:07:55.600
 And then you notice you're thinking and you're not paying attention to the breath anymore

1:07:55.600 --> 1:08:00.040
 and then you realize, okay, the practice is, okay, I should notice thoughts and then I

1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:02.160
 should come back to the breath.

1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:07.560
 But this starting point is of the conventional starting point of feeling like you are an

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:13.640
 agent very likely in your head, a locus of consciousness, a locus of attention that can

1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:17.240
 strategically pay attention to certain parts of experience.

1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:21.280
 Like I can focus on the breath and then I get lost in thought and now I can come back

1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:26.840
 to the breath and I can open my eyes and I'm over here behind my face looking out at a

1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:32.000
 world that's other than me and there's this kind of subject to object perception.

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:40.240
 And that is the default starting point of selfhood, of subjectivity and married to that

1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:46.240
 is the sense that I can decide what to do next.

1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:52.320
 I am an agent who can pay attention to the cup, I can listen to sounds, there's certain

1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:55.800
 things that I can't control, certain things are happening to me and I just can't control

1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:56.800
 them.

1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:04.000
 But if someone asks, well, can you not hear a sound, right, like don't hear the next sound,

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:07.920
 don't hear anything for a second or don't hear, don't hear, you know, I'm snapping my

1:09:07.920 --> 1:09:11.520
 fingers, don't hear this, where's your free will, you know, well, like just stop this

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:12.520
 from coming in.

1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:19.240
 You realize, okay, wait a minute, my abundant freedom does not extend to something as simple

1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:23.040
 as just being able to pay attention to something else than this.

1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:28.080
 Okay, well, so that I'm not that kind of free agent, but at least I can decide what I'm

1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:29.080
 going to do next.

1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:33.320
 I'm going to pick up this water, right?

1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:39.880
 And there's a feeling of identification with the impulse, with the intention, with the

1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:44.880
 thought that occurs to you, with the feeling of speaking, like, you know, what am I going

1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:45.880
 to say next?

1:09:45.880 --> 1:09:46.880
 Well, I'm saying it.

1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:53.000
 So here goes, this is me, it feels like I'm the thinker, I'm the one who's in control

1:09:53.000 --> 1:10:01.360
 control, but all of that is born of not really paying close attention to what it's like to

1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:02.360
 be you.

1:10:02.360 --> 1:10:07.600
 And so this is, this is where meditation comes in, or this is where, again, you can get it,

1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:10.040
 you can get at this conceptually.

1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:16.320
 You can unravel the notion of free will just by thinking certain thoughts, but you can't

1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:22.160
 feel that it doesn't exist unless you can pay close attention to how thoughts and intentions

1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:23.160
 arise.

1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:27.400
 So the way to unravel it conceptually is just to realize, okay, I didn't make myself, I

1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:31.680
 didn't make my genes, I didn't make my brain, I didn't make the environmental influences

1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:38.160
 that impinged upon this system for the last 54 years that have produced my brain in precisely

1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:44.000
 the state it's in right now, such with all of the receptor weightings and densities,

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:53.200
 and it's just I'm exactly the machine I am right now through no fault of my own as the

1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:59.280
 experiencing self, I get no credit and I get no blame for the genetics and the environmental

1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:00.680
 influences here.

1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:11.800
 And yet those are the only things that contrive to produce my next thought or impulse or moment

1:11:11.800 --> 1:11:12.800
 of behavior.

1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:18.840
 And if you were going to add something magical to that clockwork, like an immortal soul,

1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:21.640
 you can also notice that you didn't produce your soul, right?

1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:26.800
 You can't account for the fact that you don't have the soul of someone who doesn't like

1:11:26.800 --> 1:11:30.680
 any of the things you like or wasn't interested in any of the things you were interested in

1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:39.720
 or was a psychopath or had an IQ of 40, like there's nothing about that that the person

1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:43.440
 who believes in a soul can claim to have controlled.

1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:48.480
 And yet that is also totally dispositive of whatever happens next.

1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:52.800
 But everything you've described now, maybe you can correct me, but it kind of speaks

1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:57.440
 to the materialistic nature of the hardware.

1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:03.040
 But even if you add magical ectoplasm software, you didn't produce that either.

1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:10.160
 I know, but if we can think about the actual computation running on the hardware and running

1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:15.640
 on the software, there's something you said recently, which you think of culture as an

1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:17.360
 operating system.

1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:24.080
 So if we just remove ourselves a little bit from the conception of human civilization

1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:31.480
 being a collection of humans and rather us just being a distributed computation system

1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:36.480
 on which there's some kind of operating system running, and then the computation that's running

1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:42.200
 is the actual thing that generates the interactions, the communications, and maybe even free will,

1:12:42.200 --> 1:12:43.920
 the experiences of all those free will.

1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:49.880
 Do you ever think of, do you ever try to reframe the world in that way where it's like ideas

1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:57.320
 are just using us, thoughts are using individual nodes in the system, and they're just jumping

1:12:57.320 --> 1:13:02.960
 around, and they also have ability to generate experiences so that we can push those ideas

1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:03.960
 along.

1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:08.400
 And basically, the main organisms here are the thoughts, not the humans.

1:13:08.400 --> 1:13:15.200
 Yeah, but then that arose the boundary between self and world.

1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:16.200
 Right.

1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:22.520
 So then there's no self, a really integrated self to have any kind of will at all.

1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:30.240
 If you're just a memeplex, if you're just a collection of memes, and we're all kind

1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:40.880
 of like currents, like eddies in this river of ideas, and it seems to have structure,

1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:46.320
 but there's no real boundary between that part of the flow of water and the rest.

1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:50.200
 And I would say that much of our mind answers to this kind of description.

1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:56.560
 So much of our mind has been, it's obviously not self generated, and you're not going to

1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:10.120
 find it by looking in the brain, it is the result of culture largely, but also the genes

1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:21.480
 on one side and culture on the other, meaning to allow for manifestations of mind that aren't

1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:27.320
 actually bounded by the person in any clear sense.

1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:33.920
 Just the example I often use here, but there's so many others, is just the fact that we're

1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:38.160
 following the rules of English grammar to whatever degree we are.

1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:42.600
 It's not that we certainly haven't consciously represented these rules for ourself.

1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:50.960
 We haven't invented these rules, there are norms of language use that we couldn't even

1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:57.240
 specify because we're not grammarians, we haven't studied this, we don't even have the

1:14:57.240 --> 1:15:04.560
 right concepts, and yet we're following these rules, and we're noticing as an error when

1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:08.360
 we fail to follow these rules.

1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:13.720
 And virtually every other cultural norm is like that, these are not things we've invented.

1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:23.040
 You can consciously decide to scrutinize them and override them, but just think of any social

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:29.200
 situation where you're with other people, and you're behaving in ways that are culturally

1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:37.280
 appropriate, you're not being wild animals together, you have some expectation of how

1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:43.960
 you shake a person's hand and how you deal with implements on a table, how you have a

1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:44.960
 meal together.

1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:49.640
 Obviously, this can change from culture to culture, and people can be shocked by how

1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:51.960
 different those things are.

1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:56.600
 We all have foods we find disgusting, but in some countries, dog is not one of those

1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:04.040
 foods, right, and yet you and I presumably would be horrified to be served dog.

1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:11.360
 Those are not norms that we're... They are outside of us in some way, and yet they're

1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:16.680
 felt very viscerally, I mean, they're either certainly felt in their violation.

1:16:16.680 --> 1:16:22.560
 If you are, just imagine, you're in somebody's home, you're eating something that tastes

1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:28.640
 great to you, and you happen to be in Vietnam or wherever, you didn't realize dog was potentially

1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:36.320
 on the menu, and you find out that you've just eaten 10 bites of what is really a Cocker

1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:45.960
 Spaniel, and you feel as instantaneous urge to vomit based on an idea.

1:16:45.960 --> 1:16:55.960
 You're not the author of that norm that gave you such a powerful experience of its violation,

1:16:55.960 --> 1:17:01.440
 and I'm sure we can trace the moment in your history vaguely where it sort of got in.

1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:06.880
 I mean, very early on as kids, you realize you're treating dogs as pets and not as food

1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:18.960
 or as potential food, but the point you just made opens us to... We are totally permeable

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:21.640
 to a sea of mind.

1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:30.000
 Yeah, but if we take the metaphor of the distributed computing systems, each individual node is

1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:35.520
 part of performing a much larger computation, but nevertheless is in charge of doing the

1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:41.880
 scheduling of, assuming it's Linux, is doing the scheduling of processes and is constantly

1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:42.880
 alternating them.

1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:46.320
 That node is making those choices.

1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:51.200
 That node sure is how it believes it has free will, and it actually has free will because

1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:56.200
 it's making those hard choices, but the choices ultimately are part of a much larger computation

1:17:56.200 --> 1:17:57.200
 that it can't control.

1:17:57.200 --> 1:18:03.040
 Isn't it possible for that node to still be... That human node is still making the

1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:04.040
 choice?

1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:12.800
 Well, yeah, it is, so I'm not saying that your body isn't really doing things, and some

1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:18.680
 of those things can be conventionally thought of as choices, so it's like, I can choose

1:18:18.680 --> 1:18:21.720
 to reach and... It's not being imposed on me.

1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:27.600
 That would be a different experience, so there's an experience of... There's definitely

1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:32.840
 a difference between voluntary and involuntary action.

1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:34.120
 Life has to get conserved.

1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:38.800
 By any account of the mind that Jettison's free will, you still have to admit that there's

1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:46.720
 a difference between a tremor that I can't control and a purposeful motor action that

1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:52.640
 I can control and I can initiate on demand, and it's associated with intentions, and it's

1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:59.840
 got efferent motor copy, which is being predictive so that I can notice errors.

1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:00.840
 I have expectations.

1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:04.800
 When I reach for this, if my hand were actually to pass through the bottle because it's a

1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:10.080
 hologram, I would be surprised, so that shows that I have a expectation of just what my

1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:14.680
 grasping behavior is going to be like even before it happens, whereas with a tremor,

1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:17.560
 you don't have the same kind of thing going on.

1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:27.760
 That's a distinction we have to make, so yes, my intention to move, which is in fact can

1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:31.080
 be subjectively felt, really is the proximate cause of my moving.

1:19:31.080 --> 1:19:33.320
 It's not coming from elsewhere in the universe.

1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:35.240
 I'm not saying that.

1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:45.480
 In that sense, the node is really deciding to execute the subroutine now, but that's

1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:55.880
 not the feeling that has given rise to this conundrum of free will.

1:19:55.880 --> 1:20:05.200
 People feel like the crucial things that people feel like they could have done otherwise.

1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:10.320
 That's the thing that, when you run back the clock of your life, run back the movie of

1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:16.400
 your life, you flip back the few pages in the novel of your life, they feel that at

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:24.680
 this point, they could behave differently than they did, but even given your distributed

1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:32.160
 computing example, it's either a fully deterministic system or it's a deterministic system that

1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:36.320
 admits of some random influence.

1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:41.880
 In either case, that's not the free will people think they have.

1:20:41.880 --> 1:20:48.040
 The free will people think they have is, damn, I shouldn't have done that.

1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:49.360
 I shouldn't have done that.

1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:51.360
 I could have done otherwise.

1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:52.840
 I should have done otherwise.

1:20:52.840 --> 1:20:59.200
 If you think about something that you deeply regret doing or that you hold someone else

1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:05.080
 responsible for because they really are the upstream agent in your mind of what they did,

1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:10.760
 that's an awful thing that that person did and they shouldn't have done it.

1:21:10.760 --> 1:21:17.080
 There is this illusion and it has to be an illusion because there's no picture of causation

1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:19.080
 that would make sense of it.

1:21:19.080 --> 1:21:23.480
 There's this illusion that if you arrange the universe exactly the way it was a moment

1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:28.560
 ago, it could have played out differently.

1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:34.960
 The only way it could have played out differently is if there's randomness added to that, but

1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:39.600
 randomness isn't what people feel would give them free will.

1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:45.720
 If you tell me that I only reached for the water bottle this time because there's a random

1:21:45.720 --> 1:21:52.200
 number generator in there kicking off values and it finally moved my hand, that's not the

1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:54.200
 feeling of authorship.

1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:55.800
 That's still not control.

1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:58.360
 You're still not making that decision.

1:21:58.360 --> 1:22:01.920
 There's actually, I don't know if you're familiar with cellular automata.

1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:08.760
 It's a really nice visualization of how simple rules can create incredible complexity that

1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:13.200
 it's like really dumb initial conditions to set, simple rules applied, and eventually

1:22:13.200 --> 1:22:15.560
 you watch this thing.

1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:21.960
 If the initial conditions are correct, then you're going to have emerge something that

1:22:21.960 --> 1:22:25.520
 to our perception system looks like organisms interacting.

1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:29.880
 You can construct any kinds of worlds and they're not actually interacting.

1:22:29.880 --> 1:22:35.200
 They're not actually even organisms and they certainly aren't making decisions.

1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:38.640
 There's systems you can create that illustrate this point.

1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:46.040
 The question is whether there could be some room for, that's used in the 21st century,

1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:49.720
 the term magic, back to the black box of consciousness.

1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:51.960
 Let me ask you this way.

1:22:51.960 --> 1:22:58.280
 If you're wrong about your intuition about free will, what, and somebody comes along to

1:22:58.280 --> 1:23:04.480
 you and proves to you that you didn't have the full picture, what would that proof look

1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:05.480
 like?

1:23:05.480 --> 1:23:12.520
 That's the problem, that's why it's not even an illusion in my world because for me, it's

1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:19.400
 impossible to say what the universe would have to be like for free will to be a thing.

1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:27.240
 It doesn't conceptually map on to any notion of causation we have and that's unlike any

1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:30.760
 other spurious claim you might make.

1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:39.360
 If you're going to believe in ghosts, I understand what that claim could be where I don't happen

1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:45.280
 to believe in ghosts but if it's not hard for me to specify what would have to be true

1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:50.440
 for ghosts to be real and so it is with a thousand other things like ghosts.

1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:55.320
 Okay, so you're telling me that when people die, there's some part of them that is not

1:23:55.320 --> 1:24:01.040
 reducible at all to their biology that lifts off them and goes elsewhere and it's actually

1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:07.480
 the kind of thing that can linger in closets and in cupboards and actually it's immaterial

1:24:07.480 --> 1:24:11.680
 but by some principle of physics, we don't totally understand, it can make sounds and

1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:21.040
 knock objects and even occasionally show up so they can be visually beheld and it seems

1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:27.240
 like a miracle but it's just some spooky noun in the universe that we don't understand.

1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:29.600
 Let's call it a ghost.

1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:30.600
 That's fine.

1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:31.920
 I can talk about that all day.

1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:35.560
 The reasons to believe in it, the reasons not to believe in it, the way we would scientifically

1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:42.840
 test for it, what would have to be provable so as to convince me that ghosts are real.

1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:44.360
 Free will isn't like that at all.

1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:52.920
 There's no description of any concatenation of causes that precedes my conscious experience

1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:56.800
 that sounds like what people think they have when they think they could have done otherwise

1:24:56.800 --> 1:25:02.120
 and that they really, that they, the conscious agent, is really in charge.

1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:09.840
 If you don't know what you're going to think next and you can't help but think it, take

1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:14.880
 those two premises on board, you don't know what it's going to be.

1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:23.560
 You can't stop it from coming and until you actually know how to meditate, you can't stop

1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:31.520
 yourself from fully living out its behavioral or emotional consequences.

1:25:31.520 --> 1:25:38.800
 Once mindfulness arguably gives you another degree of freedom here, it doesn't give you

1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:43.840
 free will, but it gives you some other game to play with respect to the emotional and

1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:51.320
 behavioral imperatives of thoughts, but short of that, I mean, the reason why mindfulness

1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:56.040
 doesn't give you free will is because you can't account for why in one moment mindfulness

1:25:56.040 --> 1:26:01.280
 arises and in other moments it doesn't, right?

1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:07.560
 But a different process is initiated once you can practice in that way.

1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:11.400
 If I could push back for a second, by the way, I just had this thought bubble come popping

1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:16.840
 up all the time of just two recent chimps arguing about the nature of consciousness.

1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:18.000
 It's kind of hilarious.

1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:24.440
 So on that thread, you know, if we're even before Einstein, let's say before Einstein,

1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:32.560
 we were to conceive about traveling from point A to point B. Say some point in the future,

1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:38.960
 we are able to realize through engineering a way which is consistent with Einstein's

1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:40.440
 theory that you can have wormholes.

1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:46.440
 You can travel from one point to another faster than the speed of light.

1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:50.840
 And that would, I think, completely change our conception of what it means to travel

1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:53.040
 in the physical space.

1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:59.000
 And that, like, completely transform our ability, you talk about causality, but here

1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:03.160
 let's just focus on what it means to travel through physical space.

1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:09.600
 Don't you think it's possible that there will be inventions or leaps in understanding

1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:18.720
 about reality that will allow us to see free will as actually, like us humans somehow may

1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:25.840
 be linked to this idea of consciousness, are actually able to be authors of our actions?

1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:29.560
 It is a nonstarter for me conceptually.

1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:35.960
 It's a little bit like saying, could there be some breakthrough that will cause us to

1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:42.600
 realize that circles are really square or that circles are not really round, right?

1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:48.960
 No, a circle is what we mean by a perfectly round form, right?

1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:52.800
 Like, it's not on the table to be revised.

1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:58.840
 And so I would say the same thing about consciousness, it's just like saying, is there some breakthrough

1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:02.600
 that would get us to realize that consciousness is really an illusion?

1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:07.800
 I'm saying no, because what the experience of an illusion is as much a demonstration

1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:10.520
 of what I'm calling consciousness as anything else, right?

1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:12.580
 That is consciousness.

1:28:12.580 --> 1:28:15.400
 With free will, it's a similar problem.

1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:25.360
 It's like, again, it comes down to a picture of causality and there's no other picture

1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:27.160
 on offer.

1:28:27.160 --> 1:28:36.600
 And what's more, I know what it's like on the experiential side to lose the thing to

1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:39.080
 which it is clearly anchored, right?

1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:44.480
 Like, it doesn't feel, and this is the question that almost nobody, people who are debating

1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:52.400
 me on the topic of free will, at 15 minute intervals, I'm making a claim that I don't

1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:59.280
 feel this thing and they never become interested in, well, what's that like?

1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:05.880
 Like, okay, you're actually saying you don't, this thing isn't true for you empirically.

1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:13.040
 It's not just, because most people who don't believe in free will philosophically also believe

1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:15.320
 that we're condemned to experience it.

1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:18.320
 Like, you can't live without this feeling.

1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:26.640
 So you're actually saying you're able to experience the absence of the illusion of free

1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:36.760
 will for, we're talking about a few minutes at a time, or is this to require a lot of

1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:41.680
 work and meditation, or are you literally able to load that into your mind and play

1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:42.680
 that move?

1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:44.760
 Right now, just in this conversation.

1:29:44.760 --> 1:29:51.680
 So it's not absolutely continuous, but it's whenever I pay attention.

1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:57.560
 It's like, and I would say the same thing for the elusoriness of the self, and again,

1:29:57.560 --> 1:29:58.840
 we haven't talked about this.

1:29:58.840 --> 1:30:02.600
 Can you still have the self and not have the free will in your mind at the same time?

1:30:02.600 --> 1:30:04.040
 Or do they go at the same time?

1:30:04.040 --> 1:30:05.040
 This is the same, yeah.

1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:06.040
 It's the same thing.

1:30:06.040 --> 1:30:08.800
 They're always holding hands when they walk out the door.

1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:10.680
 They really are two sides of the same coin.

1:30:10.680 --> 1:30:16.640
 But it's just, it comes down to what it's like to try to get to the end of the sentence,

1:30:16.640 --> 1:30:21.320
 or what it's like to finally decide that it's been long enough and now I need another sip

1:30:21.320 --> 1:30:22.320
 of water.

1:30:22.320 --> 1:30:23.320
 Right?

1:30:23.320 --> 1:30:28.720
 If I'm paying attention, now if I'm not paying attention, I'm captured by some other thought

1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:30.800
 and that feels a certain way, right?

1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:37.040
 And so it's not vivid, but if I try to make vivid this experience of just, okay, I'm finally

1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:38.240
 going to experience free will.

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:40.880
 I'm going to notice my free will, right?

1:30:40.880 --> 1:30:41.880
 It's got to be here.

1:30:41.880 --> 1:30:43.440
 Everyone's talking about it.

1:30:43.440 --> 1:30:44.440
 Where is it?

1:30:44.440 --> 1:30:45.440
 I'm going to pay attention to it.

1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:46.440
 I'm going to look for it.

1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:52.160
 And I'm going to create a circumstance that is, where it has to be most robust, right?

1:30:52.160 --> 1:30:54.640
 I'm not rushed to make this decision.

1:30:54.640 --> 1:30:57.040
 I'm not, it's not a reflex.

1:30:57.040 --> 1:30:58.040
 I'm not under pressure.

1:30:58.040 --> 1:30:59.920
 I'm going to take as long as I want.

1:30:59.920 --> 1:31:02.200
 I'm going to decide.

1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:03.200
 It's not trivial.

1:31:03.200 --> 1:31:05.880
 So it's not just like reaching with my left hand or reaching with my right hand.

1:31:05.880 --> 1:31:07.840
 People don't like those examples for some reason.

1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:16.440
 Just make a big decision like where should, what should my next podcast be on, right?

1:31:16.440 --> 1:31:18.800
 Who do I invite on the next podcast?

1:31:18.800 --> 1:31:20.840
 What is it like to make that decision?

1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:27.320
 When I pay attention, there is no evidence of free will anywhere in sight.

1:31:27.320 --> 1:31:33.360
 It doesn't feel like, it feels profoundly mysterious to be going back between two people.

1:31:33.360 --> 1:31:39.680
 Like, is it going to be person A or person B, that all my reasons for A and all my reasons

1:31:39.680 --> 1:31:44.680
 why not and all my reasons for B and that there's some math going on there that I'm

1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:49.840
 not, not even privy to where certain concerns are trumping others.

1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:53.360
 And at a certain point, I just decide.

1:31:53.360 --> 1:31:57.160
 And yes, you can say I'm the node in the network that has made that decision.

1:31:57.160 --> 1:31:58.160
 Absolutely.

1:31:58.160 --> 1:32:02.680
 I'm not saying it's being piped to me from elsewhere, but the feeling of what it's like

1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:15.720
 to make that decision is totally without a sense, a real sense of agency.

1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:18.840
 Because something simply emerges.

1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:26.080
 It's literally as tenuous as what's the next sound I'm going to hear, right?

1:32:26.080 --> 1:32:29.640
 Or what's the next thought that's going to appear?

1:32:29.640 --> 1:32:32.640
 And it just, something just appears.

1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:37.880
 And if something appears to cancel that something, like if I say, I'm going to invite her and

1:32:37.880 --> 1:32:41.600
 then I'm about to send the email and I think, oh, no, no, no, no, I can't, I can't do that.

1:32:41.600 --> 1:32:47.960
 There was a thing in the New Yorker article I read that I got to talk to this guy, right?

1:32:47.960 --> 1:32:54.040
 That pivot at the last second, you can make it as, as muscular as you want.

1:32:54.040 --> 1:32:56.120
 It always just comes out of the darkness.

1:32:56.120 --> 1:32:57.840
 It's always mysterious.

1:32:57.840 --> 1:33:02.560
 So right, when you try to pin it down, you really can't ever find that free will.

1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:07.440
 The, the, the, the, if you construct an experiment for yourself and you try to really find that

1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:13.200
 moment when you're actually making that controlled author decision, it's, it's, uh, it's very

1:33:13.200 --> 1:33:14.200
 difficult to do.

1:33:14.200 --> 1:33:18.200
 And we're still, we're still, we know at this point that if we were scanning your brain

1:33:18.200 --> 1:33:24.240
 in some, you know, podcast guest choosing experiment, right?

1:33:24.240 --> 1:33:29.680
 We know at this point, we would be privy to who you're going to pick before you are.

1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:30.680
 You the Conscious Agent.

1:33:30.680 --> 1:33:35.360
 So if we could, again, this is operationally a little hard to conduct, but there's enough

1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:42.960
 data now to know that something very much like this cartoon is in fact true, um, and

1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:48.040
 will ultimately be undeniable for people, um, they'll be able to do it on themselves

1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:50.560
 with their, you know, some app.

1:33:50.560 --> 1:33:56.120
 Um, if you're deciding what to, you know, where to go for dinner or who to have on your

1:33:56.120 --> 1:34:00.960
 podcast, or ultimately, you know, who to marry, right, or what city to move to, right?

1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:05.720
 Like you're, you can make it as big or small a decision as you want.

1:34:05.720 --> 1:34:08.440
 We could be scanning your brain in real time.

1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:15.240
 And at a point where you still think you're uncommitted, we would be able to say with

1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:20.760
 arbitrary accuracy, all right, Lex is, he's moving to Austin, right?

1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:21.760
 I didn't choose that.

1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:22.760
 Yeah.

1:34:22.760 --> 1:34:25.000
 He was, it was, it was going to be Austin or it was going to be Miami.

1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:29.380
 He got, he's catching one of these two waves, but it's going to be Austin.

1:34:29.380 --> 1:34:34.200
 And at a point where you subjectively, if we, if we could ask you, you would say, oh,

1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:36.840
 no, I'm still, I'm still working over here.

1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:40.780
 I'm still thinking, I'm still choosing, I'm still considering my options.

1:34:40.780 --> 1:34:46.120
 And you spoke into this in you thinking about other stuff in the world, it's been very

1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:51.560
 useful to, uh, to step away from this illusion of free will.

1:34:51.560 --> 1:34:55.360
 And you argue that it's probably makes a better world because it can be compassionate and

1:34:55.360 --> 1:34:56.960
 empathetic towards others.

1:34:56.960 --> 1:34:57.960
 And toward oneself.

1:34:57.960 --> 1:34:58.960
 Toward oneself.

1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:05.160
 I mean, radically toward others in that literally hate makes no sense anymore.

1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:10.640
 I mean, there are certain things you can really be worried about, really want to oppose.

1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:11.640
 Really.

1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:13.800
 I mean, it's, I'm not saying you'd never have to kill another person.

1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:16.600
 Like, I mean, self defense is still a thing, right?

1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:24.280
 But the idea that you're never confronting anything other than a force of nature in the

1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:26.760
 end goes out the window, right?

1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:29.000
 Or it does go out the window when you really pay attention.

1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:37.120
 I'm not, I'm not saying that this would be easy to under, to grok if, you know, you know,

1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:38.280
 someone kills a member of your family.

1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:41.360
 I'm not saying you can just listen to my 90 minutes on free will and then you should be

1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:46.760
 able to see that person as identical to a grizzly bear or a, or a virus because there's

1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:56.200
 so, I mean, we are so evolved to deal with one another as, as fellow primates and as

1:35:56.200 --> 1:35:58.200
 agents.

1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:06.480
 But it's, yeah, when you're talking about the possibility of, you know, Christian, you

1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:08.960
 know, truly Christian forgiveness, right?

1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:20.120
 It is like, you know, as, as testified to by, you know, various saints of that flavor

1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:25.440
 over the, over them, the millennia, yeah, that is it.

1:36:25.440 --> 1:36:32.280
 That the doorway to that is to recognize that no one really at bottom made themselves.

1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:33.280
 Right.

1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:39.200
 And for everyone, what we're seeing really are differences in luck in the world.

1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:43.880
 We're seeing people who are very, very lucky to have had good parents and good genes and

1:36:43.880 --> 1:36:49.120
 being good societies and had good opportunities and to be intelligent and to be, you know,

1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:50.120
 not sociopathic.

1:36:50.120 --> 1:36:53.160
 Like none of it is on them.

1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:58.520
 They're just reaping one lot, the fruits of one lottery after another and then showing

1:36:58.520 --> 1:37:02.000
 up in the world on that basis.

1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.680
 And then so it is with, you know, every malevolent asshole out there, right?

1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:11.200
 He or she didn't make themself.

1:37:11.200 --> 1:37:18.520
 Even if that weren't possible, the utility for, for self compassion is also enormous

1:37:18.520 --> 1:37:26.760
 because it's when you just look at what it's like to regret something or to feel shame

1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:30.480
 about something or feel deep embarrassment about these states of mind or some of the

1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:37.520
 most deranging experiences anyone has and their reaction, the kind of the, the indelible

1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:42.520
 reaction to them, you know, the memory of the thing you said, the, you know, the memory

1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:47.160
 of the wedding toast you gave 20 years ago that was just mortifying, right?

1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:50.400
 The fact that that can still make you hate yourself, right?

1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:55.760
 And like, like that psychologically, that is a knot that can be untied, right?

1:37:55.760 --> 1:37:57.160
 Speak for yourself, Sam.

1:37:57.160 --> 1:37:58.160
 Clearly you're not.

1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:00.960
 You gave a great, a great toast, it was my toast that mortified.

1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:03.040
 No, no, no, that's not what I was referring to.

1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:09.320
 I, I, I'm deeply appreciative in the same way that you're referring to of every moment

1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:15.560
 I'm alive, but I'm also powered by self hate often.

1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:21.200
 Like several things in this conversation already that I've spoken, I'll be thinking about,

1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:26.360
 like that was the dumbest thing you're sitting in front of Sam Harris, he said that.

1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:30.680
 So like that, but that somehow creates a richer experience for me.

1:38:30.680 --> 1:38:34.480
 Like I've, I've actually come to accept that as a nice feature of however my brain was

1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:35.480
 built.

1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:37.000
 I don't think I want to let go of that.

1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:45.840
 Well, the thing you, I think the thing you want to let go of is the suffering associated

1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:46.840
 with it.

1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:53.680
 So, like, so for me, so, so it's just very psychologically and ethically all of this

1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:54.680
 is very interesting.

1:38:54.680 --> 1:38:59.520
 So I don't think we ever, we should ever get rid of things like anger, right?

1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:05.760
 So like hatred is, hatred is divorceable from anger in the sense that hatred is this enduring

1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:11.640
 state where, you know, whether you're hating somebody else or hating yourself, it is just,

1:39:11.640 --> 1:39:16.000
 it is toxic and durable and ultimately useless, right?

1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:19.640
 Like it becomes, it becomes self nullifying, right?

1:39:19.640 --> 1:39:24.560
 Like you become less capable as a person to solve any of your problems.

1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:29.040
 It's not, it's not instrumental in solving the problem that is, that is, is occasioning

1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:36.120
 all this hatred and anger for the most part isn't either except as a signal of salience

1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:37.120
 that there's a problem.

1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:38.120
 Right?

1:39:38.120 --> 1:39:43.200
 So if somebody does something that makes me angry, that just promotes this situation to,

1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:48.840
 to conscious, conscious attention in a way that is stronger than might not really caring

1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:49.840
 about it, right?

1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:53.560
 And there are things that I think should make us angry in the world and they're, there's

1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:57.760
 the behavior of other people that should make us angry because we should respond to it.

1:39:57.760 --> 1:39:59.160
 And so it is with yourself.

1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:04.240
 If I do something, you know, as a parent, if I do something stupid that harms one of

1:40:04.240 --> 1:40:08.280
 my daughters, right?

1:40:08.280 --> 1:40:13.360
 My belief, my experience of myself and my beliefs about free will close the door to

1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:17.640
 my saying, well, I should have done otherwise in the sense that if I could go back in time,

1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:20.040
 I would have actually effectively done otherwise.

1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:22.800
 No, I would do, given the same causes and conditions.

1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:26.600
 I would do that thing a trillion times in a row, right?

1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:36.760
 But you know, regret and feeling bad about an outcome are still important to capacities

1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:41.840
 because like, yeah, you know, I desperately want my daughters to be happy and healthy.

1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:45.640
 So if I, if I've done something, you know, if I, if I crash the car when they're in the

1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:47.280
 car and they get injured, right?

1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:51.720
 And cause, and I'm, I do it because I was trying to change the song on my playlist or

1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:57.040
 you know, something stupid, I'm going to feel like a total asshole.

1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:02.560
 How long do, how long do I stew in that feeling of regret, right?

1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:08.800
 And to like, what utility is there to extract out of this error signal?

1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:10.240
 And then what do I do?

1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:14.320
 We're always faced with the question of what to do next, right?

1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:18.720
 And how to best do that thing, that necessary thing next.

1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:25.320
 And how much well being can we experience while doing it?

1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:31.520
 Like how much, how miserable do you need to be to solve your problems in life and to solve

1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:35.080
 the problems of, to help solve the problems of people closest to you?

1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:39.800
 You know, how, how miserable do you need to be to get through your to do list today?

1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:49.680
 Ultimately, I think you can be deeply happy going through all of it, right?

1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:58.960
 And not, and, and even navigating moments that are scary and, you know, really destabilizing

1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:07.360
 to ordinary people and, I mean, I think, you know, again, I'm, I'm always up kind of at

1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:11.040
 the edge of my own capacities here and there are all kinds of things that stress me out

1:42:11.040 --> 1:42:12.040
 and worry me.

1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:14.800
 And I'm especially something, if it's, you're going to tell me it's something with, you

1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:19.680
 know, the health of one of my kids, you know, it's very hard for me, like, it's very hard

1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:23.040
 for me to, to be truly equanimous around that.

1:42:23.040 --> 1:42:29.680
 But equanimity is so useful the moment you're in, in response mode, right?

1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:37.800
 Because I mean, the ordinary experience for me of responding to what seems like a medical

1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:46.280
 emergency for one of my kids is to be obviously super energized by concern to respond to that

1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:48.080
 emergency.

1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:55.040
 But then once I'm responding, all of my fear and agitation and worry and, oh my God, what

1:42:55.040 --> 1:43:02.000
 if this is really something terrible, but finding any of those thoughts compelling,

1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:08.400
 that only diminishes my capacity as a father to be good company while we navigate this

1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:11.600
 really turbulent passage, you know.

1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:14.760
 As you're saying this, actually, one guy comes to mind, which is Elon Musk.

1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:19.960
 One of the really impressive things to me was to observe how many dramatic things he

1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:22.520
 has to deal with throughout the day at work.

1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:29.600
 But also, if you look through his life, family too, and how he's very much actually, as you're

1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:38.040
 describing, basically a practitioner of this way of thought, which is you're not in control.

1:43:38.040 --> 1:43:42.120
 You're basically responding, no matter how traumatic the event, and there's no reason

1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:46.840
 to sort of linger on the negative feelings around that.

1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:58.760
 Well, so he's in a very specific situation, which is unlike normal life, even his normal

1:43:58.760 --> 1:44:03.160
 life, but normal life for most people, because when you just think of like, he's running

1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:08.720
 so many businesses and they're highly nonstandard businesses.

1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:14.040
 So what he's seen is everything that gets to him is some kind of emergency, like it

1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:15.040
 wouldn't be getting to him.

1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:18.640
 If it needs his attention, there's a fire somewhere.

1:44:18.640 --> 1:44:22.840
 So he's constantly responding to fires that have to be put out.

1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:27.400
 So there's no default expectation that there shouldn't be a fire.

1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:32.840
 But in our normal lives, we live, most of us who are lucky, not everyone obviously on

1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:39.120
 earth, but most of us who are at some kind of cruising altitude in terms of our lives,

1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:43.720
 where we're reasonably healthy and life is reasonably orderly and the political apparatus

1:44:43.720 --> 1:44:50.240
 around us is reasonably functional, so I said, functional for the first time in my life through

1:44:50.240 --> 1:44:51.480
 no free will of my own.

1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:58.000
 So I noticed those errors and they do not feel like agency, nor does the success of

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:03.320
 an utterance feel like agency.

1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:09.680
 When you're looking at normal human life, where you're just trying to be happy and

1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:16.640
 healthy and get work done, there's this default expectation that there shouldn't be fires.

1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:20.680
 People shouldn't be getting sick or injured.

1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:24.680
 We shouldn't be losing vast amounts of our resources.

1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:35.560
 So when something really stark like that happens, people don't have that muscle, like I've

1:45:35.560 --> 1:45:42.400
 been responding to emergencies all day long, seven days a week in business mode, and so

1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:44.200
 I have a very thick skin.

1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:47.560
 This is just another one, what it was like, I'm not expecting anything else when I wake

1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:48.560
 up in the morning.

1:45:48.560 --> 1:45:54.360
 No, we have this default sense that, I mean, honestly, most of us have the default sense

1:45:54.360 --> 1:46:00.360
 that we aren't going to die, or that maybe we're not going to die.

1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:05.080
 Death denial really is a thing.

1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:10.680
 When you can see it, just like I can see when I reach for this bottle that I was expecting

1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:15.480
 it to be solid, because when it isn't solid, when it's a hologram and my fist closes on

1:46:15.480 --> 1:46:19.160
 itself, I'm damn surprised.

1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:24.480
 People are damn surprised to find out that they're going to die, to find out that they're

1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:28.720
 sick, to find out that someone they love has died or is going to die.

1:46:28.720 --> 1:46:36.920
 It's like the fact that we are surprised by any of that shows us that we're living in

1:46:36.920 --> 1:46:50.760
 a mode that is, we're perpetually diverting ourselves from some facts that should be obvious,

1:46:50.760 --> 1:46:58.240
 and that the more salient we can make them, the more, in the case of death, it's a matter

1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:01.560
 of being able to get one's priorities straight.

1:47:01.560 --> 1:47:06.480
 The moment, again, this is hard for everybody, even those who are really in the business

1:47:06.480 --> 1:47:14.400
 of paying attention to it, but the moment you realize that every circumstance is finite,

1:47:14.400 --> 1:47:19.560
 you've got a certain number of, you know, whatever it is, 8,000 days left in a normal

1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:25.800
 span of life, and 8,000 sounds like a big number, it's not that big a number, right?

1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:32.040
 So it's just like, and then you can decide how you want to go through life and how you

1:47:32.040 --> 1:47:34.640
 want to experience each one of those days.

1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:40.400
 And so I was, back to where our jumping off point, I would argue that you don't want

1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:44.080
 to feel self hatred ever.

1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:57.600
 I would argue that you don't want to really grasp on to any of those moments where you

1:47:57.600 --> 1:48:01.840
 internalizing the fact that you just made an error, you embarrassed yourself, that something

1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:03.680
 didn't go the way you wanted it to.

1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:06.960
 I think you want to treat all of those moments very, very lightly.

1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:11.160
 You want to extract the actionable information.

1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:12.160
 It's something to learn.

1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:18.920
 You know, I learned that when I prepare in a certain way, it works better than when I

1:48:18.920 --> 1:48:21.080
 prepare in some other way or don't prepare, right?

1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:25.800
 Like, yes, lesson learned, you know, and do that differently.

1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:40.040
 But yeah, I mean, so many, so many, so many of us have spent so much time with a very

1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:48.280
 dysfunctional and hostile and even hateful inner voice governing a lot of our self talk

1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:51.560
 and a lot of just our default way of being with ourselves.

1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:57.560
 I mean, the privacy of our own minds, we're in the company of a real jerk a lot of the

1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:05.760
 time and that can't help but affect, I mean, forget about just your own sense of well being.

1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:10.200
 You can't help but limit what you're capable of in the world with other people.

1:49:10.200 --> 1:49:12.080
 I'll have to really think about that.

1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:16.800
 I just take pride that my jerk, my inner voice jerk is much less of a jerk than like

1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:20.200
 somebody like David Goggins who's like screaming in his ear constantly.

1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:25.480
 So I have a relativist kind of perspective that it's not as bad as that at least.

1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:29.920
 Well, having a sense of humor also helps, you know, it's just like it's not, the stakes

1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:32.880
 are never quite what you think they are.

1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:38.880
 And even when they are, I mean, it's just the difference between being able to see the

1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:46.320
 comedy of it rather than because again, there's this sort of dark star of self absorption

1:49:46.320 --> 1:49:49.360
 that pulls everything into it, right?

1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:57.120
 And if that's the algorithm you don't want to run, it's like you just want things to

1:49:57.120 --> 1:49:58.120
 be good.

1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:05.400
 If you push the concern out there, like not have the collapse of, oh my God, what does

1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:06.400
 this say about me?

1:50:06.400 --> 1:50:10.760
 It's just like, what does this say about, how do we make this meal that we're all having

1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:15.680
 together as fun and as useful as possible?

1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:19.680
 And you're saying in terms of propulsion systems, you recommend humor as a good spaceship to

1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:23.400
 escape the gravitational field of that darkness.

1:50:23.400 --> 1:50:25.000
 Well, that certainly helps.

1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:26.000
 Yeah.

1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:31.520
 So, let me ask you a little bit about ego and fame, which is very interesting, the way

1:50:31.520 --> 1:50:39.720
 you're talking, given that you're one of the biggest intellects, living intellects and

1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:47.480
 minds of our time, and there's a lot of people that really love you and almost elevate you

1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:50.680
 to a certain kind of status where you're like the guru.

1:50:50.680 --> 1:50:54.240
 I'm surprised you didn't show up in a robe, in fact.

1:50:54.240 --> 1:50:59.320
 Is there a hoodie, that's not the highest status garment one can wear now?

1:50:59.320 --> 1:51:02.080
 The socially acceptable version of the robe.

1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:04.720
 If you're a billionaire, you wear a hoodie.

1:51:04.720 --> 1:51:12.520
 Is there something you can say about managing the effects of fame on your own mind, on not

1:51:12.520 --> 1:51:18.520
 creating this, when you wake up in the morning, when you look up in the mirror, how do you

1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:26.560
 get your ego not to grow exponentially, your conception of self to grow exponentially, because

1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:28.840
 there's so many people feeding that.

1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:30.400
 Is there something to be said about this?

1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:38.320
 It's really not hard, because I feel like I have a pretty clear sense of my strengths

1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:45.720
 and weaknesses, and I don't feel like it's... Honestly, I don't feel like I suffer

1:51:45.720 --> 1:51:48.720
 from much grandiosity.

1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:52.640
 I just have a... There's so many things I'm not good at.

1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:58.320
 There's so many things I will... Given the remaining 8,000 days at best, I will never

1:51:58.320 --> 1:52:00.000
 get good at.

1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:06.040
 I would love to be good at these things, so it's easy to feel diminished by comparison

1:52:06.040 --> 1:52:08.840
 with the talents of others.

1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:14.320
 Do you remind yourself of all the things that you're not competent in?

1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:19.440
 Well, they're just on display for me every day that I appreciate the talents of others.

1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:20.440
 You notice them.

1:52:20.440 --> 1:52:25.880
 I'm sure Stalin and Hitler did not notice all the ways in which they were... I mean,

1:52:25.880 --> 1:52:31.640
 this is why absolute power corrupts absolutely, is you stop noticing the things in which you're

1:52:31.640 --> 1:52:33.280
 ridiculous and wrong.

1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:34.280
 Right.

1:52:34.280 --> 1:52:35.280
 Yeah.

1:52:35.280 --> 1:52:36.280
 No, I...

1:52:36.280 --> 1:52:37.280
 Not to compare you to Stalin.

1:52:37.280 --> 1:52:38.280
 Yeah.

1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:44.040
 Well, I'm sure there's an inner Stalin in there somewhere, but hopefully he wears better

1:52:44.040 --> 1:52:49.280
 clothes and I'm not going to grow that mustache.

1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:53.840
 Those concerns don't map on... They don't map on to me for a bunch of reasons, but one

1:52:53.840 --> 1:53:01.600
 is I also have a very peculiar audience, and I've been appreciating this for a few years,

1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:07.600
 but I'm just now beginning to understand that there are many people who have audiences

1:53:07.600 --> 1:53:13.240
 of my size or larger that have a very different experience of having an audience than I do.

1:53:13.240 --> 1:53:25.000
 I have curated for better or worse a peculiar audience, and the net result of that is virtually

1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:31.600
 any time I say anything of substance, something like half of my audience, my real audience,

1:53:31.600 --> 1:53:38.360
 not haters from outside my audience, but my audience, is just revolts over it.

1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:43.320
 They just like, oh my God, I can't believe you, you're such a schmuck, right?

1:53:43.320 --> 1:53:47.280
 They revolt with rigor and intellectual sophistication, which is great.

1:53:47.280 --> 1:53:48.280
 Or not.

1:53:48.280 --> 1:53:49.280
 Or not.

1:53:49.280 --> 1:53:50.280
 What I've seen.

1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:55.240
 But people who are... I mean, the clearest case is, I have whatever audience I have and

1:53:55.240 --> 1:54:00.800
 then Trump appears on the scene, and I discover that something like 20% of my audience just

1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:05.160
 went straight to Trump and couldn't believe I didn't follow them there.

1:54:05.160 --> 1:54:10.000
 They were just a guess that I didn't see that Trump was obviously exactly what we needed

1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:18.960
 for to steer the ship of state for the next four years and then four years beyond that.

1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:20.520
 That's one example.

1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:25.480
 So whenever I said anything about Trump, I would hear from people who loved more or

1:54:25.480 --> 1:54:30.920
 less everything else I was up to and had for years, but everything I said about Trump

1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:36.240
 just gave me pure pain from this quadrant of my audience.

1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:41.560
 But then the same thing happens when I say something about the derangement of the far

1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:42.560
 left.

1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:48.840
 Anything I say about wokeness or identity politics, same kind of punishment signal from us.

1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:54.400
 Again, people who are core to my audience, like I've read all your books, I'm using your

1:54:54.400 --> 1:55:00.000
 meditation app, I love what you say about science, but you are so wrong about politics

1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:04.480
 and I'm starting to think you're a racist asshole for everything you said about identity

1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:12.080
 politics and the free will topic is just like this.

1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:16.320
 They love what I'm saying about consciousness and the mind and they love to hear me talk

1:55:16.320 --> 1:55:20.520
 about physics with physicists and it's all good.

1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:24.560
 This free will stuff is I cannot believe you don't see how wrong you are.

1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:27.960
 What a fucking embarrassment you are.

1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:32.320
 But I'm starting to notice that there are other people who don't have this experience

1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:37.440
 of having an audience because they have just take the Trump woke dichotomy.

1:55:37.440 --> 1:55:43.480
 They just castigated Trump the same way I did, but they never say anything bad about

1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:44.480
 the far left.

1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:47.960
 So they never get this punishment signal or you flip it.

1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:54.400
 They're all about the insanity of critical race theory now.

1:55:54.400 --> 1:55:59.600
 We connect all those dots the same way, but they never really specified what was wrong

1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:04.200
 with Trump or they thought there was a lot right with Trump and they got all the pleasure

1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:05.360
 of that.

1:56:05.360 --> 1:56:12.640
 And so they have much more homogenized audiences and so my experience is just to come back

1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:21.080
 to this experience of fame or quasi fame and truth is not real fame, but it's still there's

1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:24.200
 an audience there.

1:56:24.200 --> 1:56:33.000
 It is a, it's now an experience where basically whatever I put out, I notice a ton of negativity

1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:37.800
 coming back at me and it just, it is what it is.

1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:42.200
 I mean, now it's like, I used to think, wait a minute, there's got to be some way for me

1:56:42.200 --> 1:56:50.000
 to communicate more clearly here so as not to get this kind of lunatic response from

1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:55.440
 my own audience, from like people who are showing all the signs of, we've been here

1:56:55.440 --> 1:56:57.160
 for years for a reason, right?

1:56:57.160 --> 1:56:59.160
 These are not just trolls.

1:56:59.160 --> 1:57:04.920
 And so I think, okay, I'm going to take 10 more minutes and really just tell you what

1:57:04.920 --> 1:57:07.840
 it should be absolutely clear about what's wrong with Trump, right?

1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:13.480
 I've done this a few times, but I've got to do this again or wait a minute, how are they

1:57:13.480 --> 1:57:18.880
 not getting that these episodes of police violence are so obviously different from

1:57:18.880 --> 1:57:25.240
 one another that you can't describe all of them to, you know, yet another racist maniac

1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:31.080
 on the police force, you know, killing someone based on his racism.

1:57:31.080 --> 1:57:35.680
 Last time I spoke about this, it was pure pain, but I've got to just got to try again.

1:57:35.680 --> 1:57:39.840
 Now at a certain point, I mean, I'm starting to feel like, all right, I just, I have to

1:57:39.840 --> 1:57:45.320
 be, I have to cease again, it comes back to this expectation that there shouldn't be

1:57:45.320 --> 1:57:46.320
 fires.

1:57:46.320 --> 1:57:52.320
 Like, I feel like if I could just play my game impeccably, the people who actually

1:57:52.320 --> 1:58:00.280
 care what I think will follow me when I hit Trump and hit free will and hit the woke and

1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:06.080
 hit whatever it is, how we should respond to the coronavirus, you know, vaccines, you

1:58:06.080 --> 1:58:07.600
 know, are they a thing, right?

1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:14.720
 Like, there's such derangement in our information space now that, I mean, I guess, you know,

1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:16.720
 some people could be getting more of this than I expect.

1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:22.320
 But I just noticed that, you know, many of our friends who are in the same game have

1:58:22.320 --> 1:58:28.200
 more homogenized audiences and don't get, I mean, they've successfully filtered out

1:58:28.200 --> 1:58:32.320
 the people who are going to despise them on this next topic.

1:58:32.320 --> 1:58:37.000
 And I, you know, I would imagine you are, have a different experience of having a podcast

1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:38.440
 than I do at this point.

1:58:38.440 --> 1:58:45.080
 I'm sure you get haters, but I would imagine you're more streamlined.

1:58:45.080 --> 1:58:51.400
 I actually don't like the word haters because it kind of presumes that it puts people in

1:58:51.400 --> 1:58:52.400
 a bin.

1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:56.960
 I think we're all have, like, baby haters inside of us and we just apply them and some

1:58:56.960 --> 1:59:01.800
 people enjoy doing that more than others for particular periods of time.

1:59:01.800 --> 1:59:05.880
 I think you're going to almost see hating on the internet as a video game that you just

1:59:05.880 --> 1:59:09.880
 play and it's fun, but then you can put it down and walk away.

1:59:09.880 --> 1:59:13.120
 And no, I certainly have a bunch of people that are very critical.

1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:14.680
 I can list all the ways.

1:59:14.680 --> 1:59:19.640
 But does it feel like on any given topic, does it feel like it's an actual title surge

1:59:19.640 --> 1:59:25.320
 where it's like 30% of your audience and then the other 30% of your audience from podcast

1:59:25.320 --> 1:59:26.320
 to podcast?

1:59:26.320 --> 1:59:27.320
 No, no, no.

1:59:27.320 --> 1:59:29.560
 That's happening to me all the time now.

1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:32.440
 Well, I'm more with, I don't know what you think about this.

1:59:32.440 --> 1:59:37.960
 Joe Rogan doesn't read comments or doesn't read comments much.

1:59:37.960 --> 1:59:48.360
 And the argument he made to me is that he already has like a self critical person inside.

1:59:48.360 --> 1:59:52.000
 And I'm going to have to think about what you said in this conversation, but I have

1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:58.120
 this very harshly self critical person inside as well where I don't need more fuel.

1:59:58.120 --> 2:00:05.160
 I don't need, no, I do sometimes, that's why I check negativity occasionally, not too

2:00:05.160 --> 2:00:06.160
 often.

2:00:06.160 --> 2:00:12.160
 I sometimes need to put a little bit more like coals into the fire, but not too much.

2:00:12.160 --> 2:00:16.000
 But I already have that self critical engine that keeps me in check.

2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:23.920
 I wonder, a lot of people who gain more and more fame lose that ability to be self critical.

2:00:23.920 --> 2:00:28.800
 I guess because they lose the audience that can be critical towards them.

2:00:28.800 --> 2:00:32.240
 I do follow Joe's advice much more than I ever have here.

2:00:32.240 --> 2:00:41.120
 I don't look at comments very often and I'm probably using Twitter 5% as much as I used

2:00:41.120 --> 2:00:42.120
 to.

2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:50.000
 I really just get in and out on Twitter and spend very little time in my ad mentions.

2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:54.520
 In some ways it feels like a loss because occasionally I see something super intelligent

2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:55.520
 there.

2:00:55.520 --> 2:01:00.080
 I'll check my Twitter ad mentions and someone will have said, oh, have you read this article?

2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:05.120
 And it's like, man, that was just like the best article sent to me in a month, right?

2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:11.080
 So it's like to have not have looked and to not have seen that, that's a loss.

2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:21.560
 But at this point, a little goes a long way because it's not that it, for me now, I mean,

2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:26.840
 this could sound like a fairly Stalinistic immunity to criticism.

2:01:26.840 --> 2:01:33.240
 It's not so much that these voices of hate turn on my inner hater more.

2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:41.320
 It's more that I get what I fear is a false sense of humanity.

2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:46.800
 I feel like I'm too online and online is selecting for this performative outrage in everybody.

2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:50.640
 Everyone's signaling to an audience when they trash you.

2:01:50.640 --> 2:02:02.160
 And I'm getting a misanthropic cut of just what is like out there because when you meet

2:02:02.160 --> 2:02:05.000
 people in real life, they're great.

2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:12.960
 They're rather often great and it takes a lot to have anything like a Twitter encounter

2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:17.000
 in real life with a living person.

2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:23.840
 And I think it's much better to have that as one's default sense of what it's like

2:02:23.840 --> 2:02:30.600
 to be with people than what one gets on social media or on YouTube comment threads.

2:02:30.600 --> 2:02:37.520
 You've produced a special episode with Rob Reed on your podcast recently on how bioengineering

2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:40.560
 of viruses is going to destroy human civilization.

2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:41.560
 So

2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:42.560
 Or could

2:02:42.560 --> 2:02:43.560
 Could

2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:44.560
 One beers, yeah

2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:45.560
 Sorry, the conference there.

2:02:45.560 --> 2:02:52.720
 But in the 21st century, what do you think, especially after having thought through that

2:02:52.720 --> 2:03:00.880
 angle, what do you think is the biggest threat to the survival of the human species?

2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:02.880
 I can give you the full menu if you'd like.

2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:10.800
 Yeah, I would put the biggest threat at another level out.

2:03:10.800 --> 2:03:20.880
 The meta threat is our inability to agree about what the threats actually are and to

2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:25.200
 converge on strategies for responding to them.

2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:35.800
 So I view COVID as, among other things, a truly terrifyingly failed dress rehearsal for

2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:36.800
 something far worse.

2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:43.040
 I mean, COVID is just about as benign as it could have been and still have been worse

2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:46.600
 than the flu when you're talking about a global pandemic.

2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:53.080
 It's going to kill a few million people, or it looks like it's killed about three million

2:03:53.080 --> 2:03:54.080
 people.

2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:59.080
 Maybe it'll kill a few million more unless something gets away from us with a variant

2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:02.640
 that's much worse or we really don't play our cards right.

2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:16.440
 But the general shape of it is it's got somewhere around, well, 1% lethality and whatever

2:04:16.440 --> 2:04:23.520
 side of that number it really is on in the end, it's not what would, in fact, be possible

2:04:23.520 --> 2:04:30.320
 and is, in fact, probably inevitable something with orders of magnitude, more lethality

2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:31.320
 than that.

2:04:31.320 --> 2:04:35.920
 And it's just so obvious we are totally unprepared.

2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:41.840
 We are running this epidemiological experiment of linking the entire world together and then

2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:50.040
 also now per the podcast that Rob Reed did, democratizing the tech that will allow us

2:04:50.040 --> 2:04:53.360
 to do this to engineer pandemics.

2:04:53.360 --> 2:05:03.400
 And more and more people will be able to engineer synthetic viruses that will be by the sheer

2:05:03.400 --> 2:05:08.960
 fact that they would have been engineered with malicious intent worse than COVID.

2:05:08.960 --> 2:05:14.480
 And we're still living in, to speak specifically about the United States, we have a country

2:05:14.480 --> 2:05:21.040
 here where we can't even agree that this is a thing, that COVID, there's still people

2:05:21.040 --> 2:05:26.040
 who think that this is basically a hoax designed to control people.

2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:33.400
 And it's stranger still, there are people who will acknowledge that COVID is real and

2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:42.960
 they don't think the deaths have been faked or mis ascribed.

2:05:42.960 --> 2:05:50.880
 But they think that they're far happier at the prospect of catching COVID than they are

2:05:50.880 --> 2:05:53.600
 of getting vaccinated for COVID.

2:05:53.600 --> 2:05:57.240
 They're not worried about COVID, they're worried about vaccines for COVID.

2:05:57.240 --> 2:06:03.040
 And the fact that we just can't converge in a conversation that we've now had a year

2:06:03.040 --> 2:06:08.600
 to have with one another on just what is the ground truth here?

2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:17.880
 What's happened, why has it happened, how safe is it to get COVID in every cohort in

2:06:17.880 --> 2:06:21.240
 the population and how safe are the vaccines?

2:06:21.240 --> 2:06:26.440
 And the fact that there's still an air of mystery around all of this for much of our

2:06:26.440 --> 2:06:32.280
 society does not bode well when you're talking about solving any other problem that may yet

2:06:32.280 --> 2:06:33.280
 kill us.

2:06:33.280 --> 2:06:36.640
 But do you think convergence grows with the magnitude of the threat?

2:06:36.640 --> 2:06:44.000
 It's possible except I feel like we have tipped into, because when the threat of COVID looked

2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:50.280
 the most dire, when we were seeing reports from Italy that looked like the beginning

2:06:50.280 --> 2:06:51.280
 of a zombie movie.

2:06:51.280 --> 2:06:52.840
 Because it could have been much, much worse.

2:06:52.840 --> 2:06:55.600
 Yeah, this is lethal.

2:06:55.600 --> 2:07:00.200
 Your ICUs are going to fill up and you're 14 days behind us.

2:07:00.200 --> 2:07:05.080
 Your medical system is in danger of collapse.

2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:06.800
 Lock the fuck down.

2:07:06.800 --> 2:07:13.120
 We have people refusing to do anything sane in the face of that.

2:07:13.120 --> 2:07:16.840
 People fundamentally thinking it's not going to get here, right?

2:07:16.840 --> 2:07:19.960
 That's who knows what's going on in Italy, but it has no implications for what's going

2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:23.360
 to go on in New York in a mere six days, right?

2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:29.680
 And now it kicks off in New York and you've got people in the middle of the country thinking

2:07:29.680 --> 2:07:34.520
 it's no factor, it's not, that's just big city, those are big city problems, or they're

2:07:34.520 --> 2:07:41.680
 faking it, or, I mean, it just, the layer of politics has become so dysfunctional for

2:07:41.680 --> 2:07:50.200
 us that even in what, in the presence of a pandemic that looked legitimately scary there

2:07:50.200 --> 2:07:53.280
 in the beginning, I mean, it's not to say that it hasn't been devastating for everyone

2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:56.920
 who's been directly affected by it, and it's not to say it can't get worse.

2:07:56.920 --> 2:08:03.720
 But here, for a very long time, we have known that we were in a situation that is more benign

2:08:03.720 --> 2:08:12.080
 than what seemed like the worst case scenario as it was kicking off, especially in Italy.

2:08:12.080 --> 2:08:18.560
 And so still, yeah, it's quite possible that if we saw the asteroid hurtling toward earth

2:08:18.560 --> 2:08:25.520
 and everyone agreed that it's going to make impact and we're all going to die, then we

2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:32.880
 could get off Twitter and actually build the rockets that are going to divert the asteroid

2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:37.920
 from its earth crossing path, and we could do something pretty heroic.

2:08:37.920 --> 2:08:47.240
 But when you talk about anything else that isn't, that's slower moving than that, I mean,

2:08:47.240 --> 2:08:55.200
 something like climate change, I think the prospect of our converging on a solution to

2:08:55.200 --> 2:09:00.480
 climate change purely based on political persuasion is nonexistent at this point.

2:09:00.480 --> 2:09:07.040
 I just think to bring Elon back into this, the way to deal with climate change is to

2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:14.680
 create technology that everyone wants that is better than all the carbon producing technology.

2:09:14.680 --> 2:09:19.920
 And then we just transition because you want an electric car the same way you wanted a

2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:25.840
 smartphone or you want anything else, and you're working totally with the grain of people's

2:09:25.840 --> 2:09:29.040
 selfishness and short term thinking.

2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:34.000
 The idea that we're going to convince the better part of humanity, that climate change

2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:39.200
 is an emergency, that they have to make sacrifices to respond to.

2:09:39.200 --> 2:09:46.440
 Given what's happened around COVID, I just think that's the fantasy of a fantasy.

2:09:46.440 --> 2:09:51.400
 But speaking of Elon, I have a bunch of positive things that I want to say here in response

2:09:51.400 --> 2:09:55.000
 to you, but you're opening so many threads, but let me pull out one of them, which is

2:09:55.000 --> 2:10:05.680
 AI, both you and Elon think that with AI, you're summoning demons, summoning a demon.

2:10:05.680 --> 2:10:07.840
 Maybe not in those poetic terms, but.

2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:19.800
 Well, potentially, two very, three very parsimonious assumptions I think here, scientifically parsimonious

2:10:19.800 --> 2:10:25.280
 assumptions get me there.

2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:30.880
 Any of which could be wrong, but it just seems like the weight of the evidence is on their

2:10:30.880 --> 2:10:31.880
 side.

2:10:31.880 --> 2:10:37.320
 One is that it comes back to this topic of substrate independence.

2:10:37.320 --> 2:10:44.960
 And who's in the business of producing intelligent machines must believe ultimately that there's

2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:47.560
 nothing magical about having a computer made of meat.

2:10:47.560 --> 2:10:53.880
 You can do this in the kinds of materials we're using now.

2:10:53.880 --> 2:11:02.400
 And there's no special something that presents a real impediment to producing human level

2:11:02.400 --> 2:11:05.200
 intelligence in silico, right?

2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:09.280
 Again, an assumption, I'm sure there are a few people who still think there is something

2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:18.960
 magical about biological systems, but leave that aside.

2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:24.480
 Given that assumption and given the assumption that we just continue making incremental progress,

2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:29.120
 it doesn't have to be Moore's law, it just has to be progress that just doesn't stop.

2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:34.760
 At a certain point, we'll get to human level intelligence and beyond.

2:11:34.760 --> 2:11:39.440
 And human level intelligence, I think, is also clearly a mirage because anything that's

2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:45.320
 human level is going to be superhuman unless we decide to dumb it down, right?

2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:47.720
 My phone is already superhuman as a calculator, right?

2:11:47.720 --> 2:11:55.040
 So why would we make the human level AI just as good as me as a calculator?

2:11:55.040 --> 2:12:03.800
 So I think if we continue to make progress, we will be in the presence of superhuman competence

2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:11.160
 for any act of intelligence or cognition that we care to prioritize.

2:12:11.160 --> 2:12:15.320
 It's not to say that we'll create everything that a human could do, maybe we'll leave certain

2:12:15.320 --> 2:12:16.600
 things out.

2:12:16.600 --> 2:12:21.560
 But anything that we care about, and we care about a lot, and we certainly care about anything

2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:28.400
 that produces a lot of power, that we care about scientific insights and the ability

2:12:28.400 --> 2:12:34.440
 to produce new technology and all of that, we'll have something that's superhuman.

2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:42.960
 And then the final assumption is just that there have to be ways to do that that are

2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:52.000
 not aligned with a happy coexistence with these now more powerful entities than ourselves.

2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:58.840
 And I would guess, and this is a kind of a rider to that assumption, there are probably

2:12:58.840 --> 2:13:06.160
 more ways to do it badly than to do it perfectly, that is perfectly aligned with our well being.

2:13:06.160 --> 2:13:13.920
 And when you think about the consequences of nonalignment, when you think about you're

2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:18.800
 now in the presence of something that is more intelligent than you are, which is to say

2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:26.840
 more competent, and obviously there are cartoon pictures of this where this is just an off

2:13:26.840 --> 2:13:30.400
 switch and we can just turn off the off switch or they're tethered to something that makes

2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:34.960
 them our slaves in perpetuity even though they're more intelligent.

2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:41.440
 But those scenarios strike me as a failure to imagine what is actually entailed by greater

2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:42.440
 intelligence.

2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:48.040
 So if you imagine something that's legitimately more intelligent than you are, and you're

2:13:48.040 --> 2:13:54.000
 now in relationship to it, you're in the presence of this thing and it is autonomous in all

2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:57.240
 kinds of ways because it had to be to be more intelligent than you are.

2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:02.000
 You built it to be all of those things.

2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:09.520
 We just can't find ourselves in a negotiation with something more intelligent than we are.

2:14:09.520 --> 2:14:18.900
 We have to have found the subset of ways to build these machines that are perpetually

2:14:18.900 --> 2:14:24.200
 amenable to our saying, oh, that's not what we meant.

2:14:24.200 --> 2:14:25.200
 That's not what we intended.

2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:26.200
 Could you stop doing that?

2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:29.520
 Just come back over here and do this thing that we actually want.

2:14:29.520 --> 2:14:35.840
 And for them to care, for them to be tethered to our own sense of our own well being such

2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:43.520
 that their utility function is, their primary utility function is for, this is I think Stuart

2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:55.040
 Russell's cartoon plan is to figure out how to tether them to a utility function that

2:14:55.040 --> 2:15:05.560
 has our own estimation of what's going to improve our well being as its master reward.

2:15:05.560 --> 2:15:12.440
 So this thing can get as intelligent as it can get, but it only ever really wants to

2:15:12.440 --> 2:15:16.480
 figure out how to make our lives better by our own view of better.

2:15:16.480 --> 2:15:22.120
 Not to say there wouldn't be a conversation about all kinds of things we're not seeing

2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:27.680
 clearly about what is better and if we were in the presence of a genie or an oracle that

2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:32.040
 could really tell us what is better, well then we presumably would want to hear that

2:15:32.040 --> 2:15:41.160
 and we would modify our sense of what to do next in conversation with these minds.

2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:55.160
 But I just feel like it is a failure of imagination to think that being in relationship to something

2:15:55.160 --> 2:16:04.440
 more intelligent than yourself isn't in most cases a circumstance of real peril.

2:16:04.440 --> 2:16:11.000
 Because it is, just to think about how everything on earth has to, if they could think about

2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:21.360
 their relationship to us, if birds could think about what we're doing, the bottom line is

2:16:21.360 --> 2:16:27.800
 they're always in danger of our discovering that there's something we care about more

2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:28.800
 than birds.

2:16:28.800 --> 2:16:36.240
 But there's something we want that disregards the well being of birds and obviously much

2:16:36.240 --> 2:16:38.120
 of our behavior is inscrutable to them.

2:16:38.120 --> 2:16:41.760
 Occasionally we pay attention to them and occasionally we withdraw our attention and

2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:45.720
 occasionally we just kill them all for reasons they can't possibly understand.

2:16:45.720 --> 2:16:50.400
 But if we're building something more intelligent than ourselves, by definition we're building

2:16:50.400 --> 2:17:00.920
 something whose horizons of value and cognition can exceed our own.

2:17:00.920 --> 2:17:08.760
 And in ways where we can't necessarily foresee, again perpetually, that they don't just wake

2:17:08.760 --> 2:17:14.280
 up one day and decide, okay, these humans need to disappear.

2:17:14.280 --> 2:17:21.000
 So I think I agree with most of the initial things you said, what I don't necessarily

2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:27.680
 agree with, of course nobody knows, but that the more likely set of trajectories that we're

2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:32.120
 going to take are going to be positive, that's what I believe.

2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:40.280
 In the sense that the way you develop, I believe the way you develop successful AI systems

2:17:40.280 --> 2:17:45.840
 will be deeply integrated with human society and for them to succeed, they're going to

2:17:45.840 --> 2:17:51.200
 have to be aligned in the way we humans are aligned with each other, which doesn't mean

2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:56.840
 we're aligned, there's no such thing, or I don't see there's such thing as a perfect

2:17:56.840 --> 2:18:02.640
 alignment, but they're going to be participating in the dance, in the game theoretic dance of

2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:06.600
 human society as they become more and more intelligent.

2:18:06.600 --> 2:18:13.040
 There could be a point beyond which we are like birds to them.

2:18:13.040 --> 2:18:16.200
 But what about an intelligence explosion of some kind?

2:18:16.200 --> 2:18:24.040
 So I believe the explosion will be happening, but there's a lot of explosion to be done

2:18:24.040 --> 2:18:26.200
 before we become like birds.

2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:30.760
 I truly believe that human beings are very intelligent in ways we don't understand, it's

2:18:30.760 --> 2:18:32.400
 not just about chess.

2:18:32.400 --> 2:18:38.080
 It's about all the intricate computation we're able to perform, common sense, our ability

2:18:38.080 --> 2:18:40.600
 to reason about this world consciousness.

2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:44.800
 I think we're doing a lot of work, we don't realize it's necessary to be done in order

2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:50.200
 to truly achieve super intelligence.

2:18:50.200 --> 2:18:53.840
 I just think there will be a period of time that's not overnight.

2:18:53.840 --> 2:18:59.600
 The overnight nature of it will not literally be overnight, it'll be over a period of decades.

2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:06.520
 But why would it be that way, but just take, draw an analogy from recent successes like

2:19:06.520 --> 2:19:13.360
 something like AlphaGo or AlphaZero, I forget the actual metric, but it was something like

2:19:13.360 --> 2:19:22.520
 this algorithm, which wasn't even totally bespoke for chess playing in the matter of,

2:19:22.520 --> 2:19:28.320
 I think it was four hours, played itself so many times and so successfully that it became

2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:33.880
 the best chess playing computer, it was not only better than every human being, it was

2:19:33.880 --> 2:19:39.800
 better than every previous chess program in a matter of a day.

2:19:39.800 --> 2:19:44.680
 Just imagine, again, we don't have to recapitulate everything about us, but just imagine building

2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:52.320
 a system and who knows when we'll be able to do this, but at some point we'll be able,

2:19:52.320 --> 2:20:01.120
 at some point, the 100 favorite things about human cognition will be analogous to chess

2:20:01.120 --> 2:20:08.080
 in that we will be able to build machines that very quickly outperform any human and

2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:14.000
 then very quickly outperform the last algorithm that outperform the humans.

2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:22.320
 Something like the AlphaGo experience seems possible for facial recognition and detecting

2:20:22.320 --> 2:20:29.240
 human emotion and natural language processing.

2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:36.520
 Everyone, even math people, math heads, tend to have bad intuitions for exponentiation.

2:20:36.520 --> 2:20:40.680
 We noticed this during COVID and we have some very smart people who still couldn't get their

2:20:40.680 --> 2:20:46.720
 minds around the fact that an exponential is really surprising.

2:20:46.720 --> 2:20:50.160
 I mean, things double and double and double and double again and you don't notice much

2:20:50.160 --> 2:20:57.760
 of anything changes and then the last two stages of doubling swamp everything.

2:20:57.760 --> 2:21:06.920
 It just seems like that to assume that there isn't a deep analogy between what we're seeing

2:21:06.920 --> 2:21:14.680
 for the more tractable problems like chess to other modes of cognition, it's like once

2:21:14.680 --> 2:21:20.560
 you crack that problem, it seems, because for the longest time, it was impossible to

2:21:20.560 --> 2:21:24.440
 think we were going to make headway in AI.

2:21:24.440 --> 2:21:27.640
 Chess and Go was seen as impossible.

2:21:27.640 --> 2:21:29.360
 Go seemed unattainable.

2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:33.360
 Even when chess had been cracked, Go seemed unattainable.

2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:38.240
 Yeah, and actually, Stuart Russell was behind the people that were saying it's unattainable

2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:43.000
 because it seemed like it's an intractable problem.

2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:47.520
 But there's something different about the space of cognition that's detached from human

2:21:47.520 --> 2:21:54.200
 society, which is what chess is, meaning just thinking, having actual exponential impact

2:21:54.200 --> 2:21:56.520
 on the physical world is different.

2:21:56.520 --> 2:22:03.800
 I tend to believe that there's four AI to get to the point where it's super intelligent.

2:22:03.800 --> 2:22:08.840
 It's going to have to go through the funnel of society, and for that, it has to be deeply

2:22:08.840 --> 2:22:12.520
 integrated with human beings, and for that, it has to be aligned.

2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:17.240
 What do you mean you're talking about actually hooking us up to the neural link where we're

2:22:17.240 --> 2:22:22.320
 going to be the brainstem to the robot overlords?

2:22:22.320 --> 2:22:24.040
 That's a possibility as well.

2:22:24.040 --> 2:22:29.640
 What I mean is, in order to develop autonomous weapon systems, for example, which are highly

2:22:29.640 --> 2:22:36.240
 concerning to me that both US and China are participating in now, that in order to develop

2:22:36.240 --> 2:22:42.840
 them and for them to become, to have more and more responsibility to actually do military

2:22:42.840 --> 2:22:50.840
 strategic actions, they're going to have to be integrated into human beings doing the

2:22:50.840 --> 2:22:51.840
 strategic action.

2:22:51.840 --> 2:22:55.280
 They're going to have to work alongside with each other, and the way those systems will

2:22:55.280 --> 2:23:02.280
 be developed will have the natural safety switches that are placed on them as they develop over

2:23:02.280 --> 2:23:06.320
 time because they're going to have to convince humans, ultimately, they're going to have

2:23:06.320 --> 2:23:12.600
 to convince humans that this is safer than humans.

2:23:12.600 --> 2:23:19.760
 Self driving cars is a good test case here because obviously, we've made a lot of progress,

2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:25.000
 and we can imagine what total progress would look like.

2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:31.660
 It would be amazing, and it's canceling in the US 40,000 deaths every year based on

2:23:31.660 --> 2:23:33.160
 ape driven cars.

2:23:33.160 --> 2:23:38.440
 So it's an excruciating problem that we've all gotten used to because there was no alternative.

2:23:38.440 --> 2:23:44.080
 But now that we can dimly see the prospect of an alternative, which if it works in a

2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:50.480
 super intelligent fashion, maybe we go down to zero highway deaths, or certainly we go

2:23:50.480 --> 2:23:52.000
 down by orders of magnitude.

2:23:52.000 --> 2:24:00.000
 So maybe we have 400 rather than 40,000 a year.

2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:08.040
 And it's easy to see that there's not an example of super intelligence.

2:24:08.040 --> 2:24:15.080
 This is narrow intelligence, but the alignment problem isn't so obvious there.

2:24:15.080 --> 2:24:18.640
 But there are potential alignment problems there.

2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:26.040
 Just imagine if some woke team of engineers decided that we have to tune the algorithm

2:24:26.040 --> 2:24:27.040
 some way.

2:24:27.040 --> 2:24:30.200
 I mean, there are situations where the car has to decide who to hit.

2:24:30.200 --> 2:24:34.040
 There's just bad outcomes where you're going to hit somebody.

2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:36.800
 Now we have a car that can tell what race you are.

2:24:36.800 --> 2:24:41.160
 So we're going to build the car to preferentially hit white people because white people have

2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:43.360
 had so much privilege over the years.

2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:47.440
 This seems like the only ethical way to kind of redress those wrongs of the past.

2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:54.000
 That's something that could get produced as an artifact, presumably, of just how you built

2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:55.000
 it.

2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.240
 And you didn't even know you engineered it that way, right?

2:24:57.240 --> 2:24:58.240
 You caused it.

2:24:58.240 --> 2:24:59.240
 Machine learning.

2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:02.400
 You put some kind of constraints on it to create those kinds of outcomes.

2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:07.200
 You basically built a racist algorithm and you didn't even intend to, or you could intend

2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:08.200
 to, right?

2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:12.440
 And it would be aligned with some people's values, but misaligned with other people's

2:25:12.440 --> 2:25:13.680
 values.

2:25:13.680 --> 2:25:18.600
 But it's like there are interesting problems, even with something as simple and obviously

2:25:18.600 --> 2:25:20.640
 good as self driving cars.

2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:25.280
 But there's a leap that I just think would be exact, but those are human problems.

2:25:25.280 --> 2:25:31.800
 I just don't think there would be a leap with autonomous vehicles, first of all, sorry.

2:25:31.800 --> 2:25:35.800
 There are a lot of trajectories which will destroy human civilization.

2:25:35.800 --> 2:25:40.120
 The argument I'm making, it's more likely that we'll take trajectories that don't.

2:25:40.120 --> 2:25:43.960
 So I don't think there will be a leap with autonomous vehicles will all of a sudden start

2:25:43.960 --> 2:25:50.720
 murdering pedestrians because once every human on earth is dead, there will be no more fatalities,

2:25:50.720 --> 2:25:55.920
 sort of unintended consequences of, and it's difficult to take that leap.

2:25:55.920 --> 2:25:59.680
 Most systems as we develop and they become much, much more intelligent in ways that will

2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:06.240
 be incredibly surprising, like stuff that's deep mind is doing with protein folding, even

2:26:06.240 --> 2:26:10.600
 which is scary to think about, and I'm personally terrified about this, which is the engineering

2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:16.840
 of viruses using machine learning, the engineering of vaccines using machine learning, right?

2:26:16.840 --> 2:26:23.920
 The engineering of, yeah, for research purposes, pathogens using machine learning, like the

2:26:23.920 --> 2:26:25.000
 ways that can go wrong.

2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:31.160
 I just think that there's always going to be a closed loop supervision of humans before

2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:38.720
 they, before they become super intelligent, not always, much more likely to be supervision.

2:26:38.720 --> 2:26:42.160
 Except of course, the question is how many dumb people are in the world?

2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:44.520
 How many evil people are in the world?

2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:51.200
 My theory, my hope is, my sense is that the number of intelligent people is much higher

2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:57.640
 than the number of dumb people that know how to program, and the number of evil people.

2:26:57.640 --> 2:27:03.480
 I think smart people and kind people over, outnumber the others.

2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:09.320
 Except we also, we have to add another group of people which are just the smart and otherwise

2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:12.160
 good, but reckless people, right?

2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:17.960
 The people who will flip a switch on, not knowing what's going to happen, they're just

2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:20.600
 kind of hoping that it's not going to blow up the world.

2:27:20.600 --> 2:27:24.720
 We already know that some of our smartest people are those sorts of people.

2:27:24.720 --> 2:27:28.840
 We know we've done experiments, and this is something that Martin Rees was whingeing

2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:36.000
 about before the Large Hadron Collider got booted up, I think.

2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:39.920
 We know there are people who are entertaining experiments or even performing experiments

2:27:39.920 --> 2:27:48.120
 where there's some chance, not quite infinitesimal, that they're going to create a black hole

2:27:48.120 --> 2:27:51.640
 in the lab and suck the whole world into it, right?

2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:57.760
 That's not, you're not a crazy person to worry about that based on the physics.

2:27:57.760 --> 2:28:04.560
 So it was with the Trinity test, there were some people who were still checking their

2:28:04.560 --> 2:28:11.400
 calculations, and we did nuclear tests where we were off significantly in terms of the

2:28:11.400 --> 2:28:12.400
 yield, right?

2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:13.400
 So it was like...

2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:14.400
 And they still flip the switch.

2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:15.400
 Yeah, they still flip the switch.

2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:22.960
 And sometimes they flip the switch not to win a world war or to save 40,000 lives a year.

2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:23.960
 They just...

2:28:23.960 --> 2:28:24.960
 Just to see what happens.

2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:25.960
 Intellectual curiosity.

2:28:25.960 --> 2:28:27.840
 Like, this is what I got my grant for.

2:28:27.840 --> 2:28:33.080
 This is where I'll get my Nobel Prize if that's in the cards.

2:28:33.080 --> 2:28:35.960
 It's on the other side of the switch, right?

2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:49.600
 And again, we are apes with egos who are massively constrained by very short term self interest

2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:57.600
 even when we're contemplating some of the deepest and most interesting and most universal problems

2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:00.880
 we could ever set our attention towards.

2:29:00.880 --> 2:29:07.800
 If you read James Watson's book, The Double Helix, right, about them cracking the structure

2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:15.040
 of DNA, one thing that's amazing about that book is just how much of it, almost all of

2:29:15.040 --> 2:29:26.600
 it, is being driven by very apish, egocentric social concerns.

2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:32.840
 The algorithm that is producing this scientific breakthrough is human competition, if you're

2:29:32.840 --> 2:29:33.840
 James Watson.

2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:34.840
 Right?

2:29:34.840 --> 2:29:41.340
 It's like, I'm going to get there before Linus Pauling and it's just so much of his

2:29:41.340 --> 2:29:44.440
 bandwidth is captured by that, right?

2:29:44.440 --> 2:29:53.480
 Now, that becomes more and more of a liability when you're talking about producing technology

2:29:53.480 --> 2:30:02.320
 that can change everything in an instant, we're talking about not only understanding, we're

2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:06.480
 just at a different moment in human history.

2:30:06.480 --> 2:30:14.360
 When we're doing research on viruses, we're now doing the kind of research that can cause

2:30:14.360 --> 2:30:24.000
 someone somewhere else to be able to make that virus or weaponize that virus or, I don't

2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:30.720
 know, our power is, our wisdom does not seem like our wisdom is scaling with our power,

2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:31.720
 right?

2:30:31.720 --> 2:30:39.360
 And that seems like, in so far, as wisdom and power become unaligned, I get more and

2:30:39.360 --> 2:30:41.160
 more concerned.

2:30:41.160 --> 2:30:48.480
 But speaking of apes with egos, some of the most compelling apes, two compelling apes

2:30:48.480 --> 2:30:56.000
 I can think of as yourself and Jordan Peterson, and you've had a fun conversation about religion

2:30:56.000 --> 2:31:02.600
 that I watched most of, I believe, and I'm not sure there was any...

2:31:02.600 --> 2:31:03.920
 We didn't solve anything.

2:31:03.920 --> 2:31:05.160
 If anything was ever solved.

2:31:05.160 --> 2:31:12.920
 So is there something like a charitable summary you can give to the ideas that you agree on

2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:14.440
 and disagree with, Jordan?

2:31:14.440 --> 2:31:21.800
 Is there something maybe after that conversation that you've landed where maybe as you both

2:31:21.800 --> 2:31:29.160
 agreed on, is there some wisdom in the rubble of even imperfect flawed ideas?

2:31:29.160 --> 2:31:33.400
 Is there something that you can kind of pull out from those conversations or is there to

2:31:33.400 --> 2:31:34.400
 be continued?

2:31:34.400 --> 2:31:44.040
 I think where we disagree, so he thinks that many of our traditional religious beliefs and

2:31:44.040 --> 2:32:03.000
 frameworks are holding so much such a repository of human wisdom that we pull at that fabric

2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:04.440
 at our peril.

2:32:04.440 --> 2:32:12.440
 If you start just unraveling Christianity or any other traditional set of norms and beliefs,

2:32:12.440 --> 2:32:16.760
 you may think you're just pulling out the unscientific bits, but you could be pulling

2:32:16.760 --> 2:32:25.640
 a lot more to which everything you care about is attached as a society.

2:32:25.640 --> 2:32:32.400
 My feeling is that there's so much downside to the unscientific bits, and it's so clear

2:32:32.400 --> 2:32:40.120
 here how we could have a 21st century rational conversation about the good stuff that we

2:32:40.120 --> 2:32:42.840
 really can radically edit these traditions.

2:32:42.840 --> 2:32:54.280
 We can take Jesus in half his moods and just find a great inspirational Iron Age thought

2:32:54.280 --> 2:32:58.840
 leader who just happened to get crucified, but he could be somewhat like the Beatitudes

2:32:58.840 --> 2:33:08.760
 and the Golden Rule, which doesn't originate with him, but which he put quite beautifully.

2:33:08.760 --> 2:33:09.760
 All of that's incredibly useful.

2:33:09.760 --> 2:33:14.240
 It's no less useful than it was 2,000 years ago, but we don't have to believe he was born

2:33:14.240 --> 2:33:18.800
 of a virgin or coming back to raise the dead or any of that other stuff.

2:33:18.800 --> 2:33:22.880
 We can be honest about not believing those things, and we can be honest about the reasons

2:33:22.880 --> 2:33:26.320
 why we don't believe those things.

2:33:26.320 --> 2:33:34.200
 On those fronts, I view the downside to be so obvious and the fact that we have so many

2:33:34.200 --> 2:33:38.520
 different competing dogmatisms on offer to be so nonfunctional.

2:33:38.520 --> 2:33:41.320
 I mean, it's so divisive.

2:33:41.320 --> 2:33:47.720
 It just has conflict built into it that I think we can be far more and should be far

2:33:47.720 --> 2:33:51.240
 more iconoclastic than he wants to be.

2:33:51.240 --> 2:34:00.120
 Now, none of this is to deny much of what he argues for, that stories are very powerful.

2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:03.440
 Clearly, stories are powerful, and we want good stories.

2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:04.840
 We want our lives.

2:34:04.840 --> 2:34:10.360
 We want to have a conversation with ourselves and with one another about our lives that

2:34:10.360 --> 2:34:17.080
 facilitates the best possible lives, and story is part of that.

2:34:17.080 --> 2:34:23.840
 If you want some of those stories to sound like myths, that might be part of it.

2:34:23.840 --> 2:34:29.920
 My argument is that we never really need to deceive ourselves or our children about what

2:34:29.920 --> 2:34:34.280
 we have every reason to believe is true in order to get at the good stuff, in order to

2:34:34.280 --> 2:34:36.280
 organize our lives well.

2:34:36.280 --> 2:34:41.240
 I certainly don't feel that I need to do it personally, and if I don't need to do it personally,

2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:45.800
 why would I think that billions of other people need to do it personally?

2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:51.680
 Now, there is a cynical counterargument, which is billions of other people don't have the

2:34:51.680 --> 2:34:54.280
 advantages that I have had in my life.

2:34:54.280 --> 2:34:59.960
 The billions of other people are not as well educated, they haven't had the same opportunities,

2:34:59.960 --> 2:35:06.800
 they need to be told that Jesus is going to solve all their problems after they die,

2:35:06.800 --> 2:35:14.080
 or that everything happens for a reason, and if you just believe in the secret, if you

2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:20.280
 just visualize what you want, you're going to get it.

2:35:20.280 --> 2:35:26.440
 Some measure of what I consider to be odious pamphlet that really is food for the better

2:35:26.440 --> 2:35:31.080
 part of humanity, and there is no substitute for it, or there's no substitute now, and

2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:35.120
 I don't know if Jordan would agree with that, but much of what he says seems to suggest

2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:39.440
 that he would agree with it.

2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:41.320
 I guess that's an empirical question.

2:35:41.320 --> 2:35:47.520
 It's just that we don't know whether, given a different set of norms and a different set

2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:55.040
 of stories, people would behave the way I would hope they would behave and be more aligned

2:35:55.040 --> 2:35:56.040
 than they are now.

2:35:56.040 --> 2:36:06.480
 I think we know what happens when you just let ancient religious certainties go uncriticized.

2:36:06.480 --> 2:36:11.200
 We know what that world's like, we've been struggling to get out of that world for a

2:36:11.200 --> 2:36:21.000
 couple of hundred years, but we know what having Europe riven by religious wars looks

2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:29.040
 like, and we know what happens when those religions become pseudo religions and political

2:36:29.040 --> 2:36:30.040
 religions.

2:36:30.040 --> 2:36:33.840
 This is where I'm sure Jordan and I would debate.

2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:38.600
 He would say that Stalin was a symptom of atheism, and that's not at all, I mean, it's not my

2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:40.800
 kind of atheism.

2:36:40.800 --> 2:36:50.080
 And the problem with the Gulag and the experiment with communism or with Stalinism or with Nazism

2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:59.360
 was not that there was so much scientific rigor and self criticism and honesty and introspection

2:36:59.360 --> 2:37:07.240
 and judicious use of psychedelics, I mean, that was not the problem in Hitler's Germany

2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:12.760
 or in Stalin's Soviet Union.

2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:22.120
 The problem was you have other ideas that capture a similar kind of mob based dogmatic

2:37:22.120 --> 2:37:30.680
 energy, and yes, the results of all of that are predictably murderous.

2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:38.560
 So the question is, what is the source of the most viral and sticky stories that ultimately

2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:40.400
 lead to a positive outcome?

2:37:40.400 --> 2:37:48.720
 So communism was, I mean, having grown up in the Soviet Union, even still, you know,

2:37:48.720 --> 2:37:55.360
 having relatives in Russia, there's a stickiness to the nationalism and to the ideologies of

2:37:55.360 --> 2:38:00.680
 communism that religious or not, you could say it's religious for forever, I could just

2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:09.080
 say it's great stories that are viral and sticky, I'm using the most horrible words,

2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:14.840
 but the question is whether science and reason can generate viral sticky stories that give

2:38:14.840 --> 2:38:20.120
 meaning to people's lives in your sense as it does.

2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:26.560
 Well, whatever is true ultimately should be captivating, right?

2:38:26.560 --> 2:38:32.120
 It's like, what's more captivating than whatever is real, right?

2:38:32.120 --> 2:38:41.320
 Now, it's because reality is, again, we're just climbing out of the darkness in terms

2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:47.280
 of our understanding of what the hell is going on, and there's no telling what spooky things

2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:48.280
 may in fact be true.

2:38:48.280 --> 2:38:54.000
 I don't know if you've been on the receiving end of recent rumors about our conversation

2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:57.720
 about UFOs very likely changing in the near term, right?

2:38:57.720 --> 2:39:03.120
 But there was just a Washington Post article and a New Yorker article, and I've received

2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:10.200
 some private outreach, and perhaps you have, I know other people in our orbit have people

2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:16.120
 who are claiming that the government has known much more about UFOs than they have led on

2:39:16.120 --> 2:39:22.200
 until now, and this conversation is actually is about to become more prominent, and it's

2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:32.280
 not going to be whoever's left standing when the music stops, it's not going to be a comfortable

2:39:32.280 --> 2:39:41.120
 position to be in as a super rigorous scientific skeptic who's been saying there's no there

2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:45.960
 there for the last 75 years, right?

2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:52.360
 The short version is it sounds like the Office of Naval Intelligence and the Pentagon are

2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:58.280
 very likely to say to Congress at some point in the not too distant future that we have

2:39:58.280 --> 2:40:06.600
 evidence that there is technology flying around here that seems like it can't possibly be

2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:08.600
 of human origin, right?

2:40:08.600 --> 2:40:11.520
 Now I don't know what I'm going to do with that kind of disclosure, right?

2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:18.200
 Obviously it's going to be nothing, no follow on conversation to really have, but that is

2:40:18.200 --> 2:40:23.320
 such a powerfully strange circumstance to be in, right?

2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:25.480
 It's just what are we going to do with that?

2:40:25.480 --> 2:40:28.360
 If in fact that's what happens, right?

2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:36.560
 If in fact the considered opinion, despite the embarrassment it causes them of the U.S.

2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:42.720
 government of all of our intelligence, all of the relevant intelligence services is that

2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:46.960
 this isn't a hoax, there's too much data to suggest that it's a hoax.

2:40:46.960 --> 2:40:52.680
 We've got too much radar imagery, there's too much satellite data, whatever data they

2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:55.600
 actually have, there's too much of it.

2:40:55.600 --> 2:41:02.880
 All we can say now is something's going on and there's no way it's the Chinese or the

2:41:02.880 --> 2:41:07.360
 Russians or anyone else's technology.

2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:15.880
 That should arrest our attention collectively to a degree that nothing in our lifetime has.

2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:27.200
 Now one worries that we're so jaded and confused and distracted that it's going to get much

2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:37.160
 less coverage than Obama's tan suit did a bunch of years ago.

2:41:37.160 --> 2:41:46.600
 Who knows how we'll respond to that, but it's just to say that the need for us to tell ourselves

2:41:46.600 --> 2:41:52.480
 an honest story about what's going on and what's likely to happen next is never going

2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:54.480
 to go away, right?

2:41:54.480 --> 2:42:00.280
 And it's important, the division between me and every person who's defending traditional

2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:09.400
 religion is where is it that you want to lie to yourself or lie to your kids?

2:42:09.400 --> 2:42:12.000
 Where is honesty a liability?

2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:17.240
 And for me, I've yet to find the place where it is.

2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:26.240
 And it's so obviously a strength in almost every other circumstance because it is the

2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:32.960
 thing that allows you to course correct, it is the thing that allows you to hope at least

2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:38.800
 that your beliefs, that your stories are in some kind of calibration with what's actually

2:42:38.800 --> 2:42:39.800
 going on in the world.

2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:47.480
 Yes, it is a little bit sad to imagine that if aliens on mass showed up to earth, that

2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:53.480
 would be too preoccupied with political bickering or to like these like fake news and all that

2:42:53.480 --> 2:42:59.400
 kind of stuff to notice the very basic evidence of reality.

2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:06.600
 I do have a glimmer of hope that there seems to be more and more hunger for authenticity.

2:43:06.600 --> 2:43:14.880
 And I feel like that opens the door for a hunger for what is real, like that people don't

2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:21.000
 want stories, they don't want like layers and layers of like fakeness.

2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:27.320
 And I'm hoping that means that will directly lead to a greater hunger for reality and reason

2:43:27.320 --> 2:43:28.320
 and truth.

2:43:28.320 --> 2:43:36.240
 You know, truth isn't dogmatism, like truth isn't authority, I have a PhD and therefore

2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:38.680
 I'm right.

2:43:38.680 --> 2:43:44.320
 Truth is almost like the reality is there's so many questions, there's so many mysteries,

2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:49.480
 there's so much uncertainty, this is our best available, like a best guess.

2:43:49.480 --> 2:43:53.240
 And we have a lot of evidence that supports that guess, but it could be so many other

2:43:53.240 --> 2:43:58.720
 things and like just even conveying that, I think there's a hunger for that in the world

2:43:58.720 --> 2:44:05.040
 to hear that from scientists, less dogmatism and more just like this is what we know, we're

2:44:05.040 --> 2:44:10.560
 doing our best given the uncertainty given, I mean, this is true with obviously with virology

2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:15.040
 and all those kinds of things, because everything is happening so fast, there's a lot of, and

2:44:15.040 --> 2:44:16.640
 biology is super messy.

2:44:16.640 --> 2:44:18.960
 So it's very hard to know stuff for sure.

2:44:18.960 --> 2:44:25.400
 So just being open and real about that, I think I'm hoping will change people's hunger

2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:29.160
 and openness and trust of what's real.

2:44:29.160 --> 2:44:30.160
 Yeah.

2:44:30.160 --> 2:44:34.960
 Well, so much of this is probabilistic, it's so much of what can seem dogmatic scientifically

2:44:34.960 --> 2:44:43.680
 is just you're just, you're placing a bet on whether it's worth reading that paper or

2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:49.480
 rethinking your presuppositions on that point, it's like, it's not fundamental closure to

2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:55.520
 data, it's just that there's so much data on one side or so much would have to change

2:44:55.520 --> 2:44:58.960
 in terms of your understanding of what you think you understand about the nature of the

2:44:58.960 --> 2:45:07.640
 world, if this new fact were so that you can pretty quickly say, all right, that's probably

2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:08.640
 bullshit.

2:45:08.640 --> 2:45:09.640
 Right.

2:45:09.640 --> 2:45:16.760
 And it can sound like a fundamental closure to new conversations, new evidence, new data,

2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:21.200
 new argument, but it's really not, it's just, it really is just triaging your attention.

2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:27.440
 It's just like, okay, you're telling me that your best friend can actually read minds.

2:45:27.440 --> 2:45:33.360
 Okay, well, that's interesting, let me know when that person has gone into a lab and actually

2:45:33.360 --> 2:45:34.360
 proven it.

2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:39.680
 This is not the place where I need to spend the rest of my day figuring out if your buddy

2:45:39.680 --> 2:45:42.800
 can read my mind.

2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:44.680
 But there's a way to communicate that.

2:45:44.680 --> 2:45:49.400
 I think it does too often sound like you're completely closed off to ideas as opposed to

2:45:49.400 --> 2:46:00.400
 saying that there's a lot of evidence in support of this, but you're still open minded to other

2:46:00.400 --> 2:46:01.400
 ideas.

2:46:01.400 --> 2:46:02.400
 There's a way to communicate that.

2:46:02.400 --> 2:46:06.120
 It's not necessarily even with words.

2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:10.920
 It's even that Joe Rogan energy of it's entirely possible.

2:46:10.920 --> 2:46:14.520
 It's that energy of being open minded and curious like kids are.

2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:19.040
 This is our best understanding, but you still are curious.

2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:24.040
 I'm not saying allocate time to exploring all those things, but still leaving the door

2:46:24.040 --> 2:46:25.040
 open.

2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:31.560
 And there's a way to communicate that I think that people really hunger for.

2:46:31.560 --> 2:46:32.560
 Let me ask you this.

2:46:32.560 --> 2:46:37.200
 I've been recently talking a lot with John Donahue from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fame.

2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:39.400
 I don't know if you know who that is.

2:46:39.400 --> 2:46:42.920
 I'm talking about somebody who's good at what he does.

2:46:42.920 --> 2:46:48.280
 And he, speaking to somebody who's open minded, the reason this ridiculous transition is for

2:46:48.280 --> 2:46:52.640
 the longest time, and even still, a lot of people believed in the Jiu Jitsu world and

2:46:52.640 --> 2:46:56.640
 grappling world that leg locks are not effective in Jiu Jitsu.

2:46:56.640 --> 2:47:02.600
 And he was somebody that inspired by the open mindedness of Dean Lister famously to him

2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:08.760
 said, why do you only consider half the human body when you're trying to do the submissions?

2:47:08.760 --> 2:47:12.600
 He developed an entire system on this other half the human body.

2:47:12.600 --> 2:47:19.160
 Anyway, I do that absurd transition to ask you because you're also a student of Brazilian

2:47:19.160 --> 2:47:20.160
 Jiu Jitsu.

2:47:20.160 --> 2:47:25.040
 Is there something you could say how that has affected your life, what you've learned

2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:28.280
 from grappling from the martial arts?

2:47:28.280 --> 2:47:34.720
 It's actually a great transition because I think one of the things that's so beautiful

2:47:34.720 --> 2:47:42.200
 about Jiu Jitsu is that it does what we wish we could do in every other area of life where

2:47:42.200 --> 2:47:48.040
 we're talking about this difference between knowledge and ignorance.

2:47:48.040 --> 2:47:51.720
 There's no room for bullshit.

2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:56.440
 You don't get any credit for bullshit.

2:47:56.440 --> 2:48:02.920
 The amazing thing about Jiu Jitsu is that the difference between knowing what's going

2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:08.840
 on and what to do and not knowing it is as the gulf between those two states is as wide

2:48:08.840 --> 2:48:21.200
 as it is in anything in human life and it can be spanned so quickly.

2:48:21.200 --> 2:48:25.320
 Each increment of knowledge can be doled out in five minutes.

2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:31.120
 Here's the thing that got you killed and here's how to prevent it from happening to you and

2:48:31.120 --> 2:48:33.200
 here's how to do it to others.

2:48:33.200 --> 2:48:42.080
 You just get this amazing cadence of discovering your fatal ignorance and then having it remedied

2:48:42.080 --> 2:48:47.760
 with the actual technique.

2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:51.160
 For people who don't know what we're talking about, it's just like the simple circumstance

2:48:51.160 --> 2:48:53.200
 of like someone's got you in a headlock.

2:48:53.200 --> 2:48:55.120
 How do you get out of that?

2:48:55.120 --> 2:49:00.080
 Someone's sitting on your chest and they're in the mount position and you're on the bottom

2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:01.880
 and you want to get away.

2:49:01.880 --> 2:49:03.040
 How do you get them off you?

2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:09.000
 You're sitting on, your intuitions about how to do this are terrible even if you've done

2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:11.840
 some other martial art.

2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:17.200
 Once you learn how to do it, the difference is night and day, it's like you have access

2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:22.400
 to a completely different physics.

2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:29.280
 I think our understanding of the world can be much more like Jiu Jitsu than it tends to

2:49:29.280 --> 2:49:30.760
 be.

2:49:30.760 --> 2:49:42.880
 I think we should all have a much better sense of when we should tap out and when we should

2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:50.360
 recognize that our epistemological arm is farred and now being broken.

2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:57.240
 The problem with debating most other topics is that most people, it isn't Jiu Jitsu and

2:49:57.240 --> 2:50:03.480
 most people don't tap out, even if it's obvious to you they're wrong and it's obvious to an

2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:07.880
 intelligent audience that they're wrong, people just double down and double down and they're

2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:13.640
 either lying or lying to themselves or they're bluffing and so you have a lot of zombies

2:50:13.640 --> 2:50:19.640
 walking around or zombie worldviews walking around which have been disconfirmed as emphatically

2:50:19.640 --> 2:50:25.280
 as someone gets armbarred or someone gets choked out in Jiu Jitsu.

2:50:25.280 --> 2:50:32.200
 Because it's not Jiu Jitsu, they can live to fight another day or they can pretend that

2:50:32.200 --> 2:50:35.960
 they didn't lose that particular argument.

2:50:35.960 --> 2:50:38.600
 Science when it works is a lot like Jiu Jitsu.

2:50:38.600 --> 2:50:44.840
 Science that when you falsify a thesis, when you think DNA is one way and it proves to

2:50:44.840 --> 2:50:51.200
 be another way, when you think it's triple stranded or whatever, it's like there is a

2:50:51.200 --> 2:50:56.840
 there there and you can get to a real consensus.

2:50:56.840 --> 2:51:05.840
 So Jiu Jitsu, for me, it was more than just of interest for self defense and the sport

2:51:05.840 --> 2:51:06.840
 of it.

2:51:06.840 --> 2:51:17.080
 It was something, it's a language and an argument you're having where you can't fool yourself

2:51:17.080 --> 2:51:18.080
 anymore.

2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:27.400
 First of all, it cancels any role of luck in a way that most other athletic feats don't.

2:51:27.400 --> 2:51:30.960
 It's like in basketball, even if you're not good at basketball, you can take the basketball

2:51:30.960 --> 2:51:37.440
 in your hand, you can be 75 feet away and hurl it at the basket and you might make it

2:51:37.440 --> 2:51:41.800
 and you could convince yourself based on that demonstration that you have some kind of talent

2:51:41.800 --> 2:51:42.800
 for basketball.

2:51:42.800 --> 2:51:51.280
 So 10 minutes on the mat with a real Jiu Jitsu practitioner, when you are not one, proves

2:51:51.280 --> 2:51:55.920
 to you that it's not like, there's no lucky punch, there's no, you're not going to get

2:51:55.920 --> 2:52:01.920
 a, there's no lucky rear naked choke you're going to perform on someone who's Marcelo

2:52:01.920 --> 2:52:02.920
 Garcia or somebody.

2:52:02.920 --> 2:52:05.400
 It's just, it's not going to happen.

2:52:05.400 --> 2:52:18.080
 And having that aspect of the usual range of uncertainty and self deception and bullshit

2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:23.760
 just stripped away was really a kind of revelation, it was just an amazing experience.

2:52:23.760 --> 2:52:27.440
 Yeah, I think it's a really powerful thing that accompanies whatever other pursuit you

2:52:27.440 --> 2:52:28.440
 have in life.

2:52:28.440 --> 2:52:34.000
 I'm not sure if there's anything like Jiu Jitsu where you could just systematically go

2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:41.560
 into a place where you're, that's honest, where your beliefs get challenged in a way

2:52:41.560 --> 2:52:42.560
 that's conclusive.

2:52:42.560 --> 2:52:43.560
 Yeah.

2:52:43.560 --> 2:52:48.960
 I haven't found too many other mechanisms, which is why it's a, we had this earlier question

2:52:48.960 --> 2:52:52.760
 about fame and ego and so on.

2:52:52.760 --> 2:52:58.480
 I'm very much relying Jiu Jitsu in my own life as a place where I can always go to have

2:52:58.480 --> 2:53:07.240
 my ego in check and that, that has effects on how I live every other aspect of my life.

2:53:07.240 --> 2:53:13.520
 Actually, even just doing any kind of, for me personally, physical challenges, like even

2:53:13.520 --> 2:53:18.600
 running, doing something that's way too hard for me and like pushing through, that's somehow

2:53:18.600 --> 2:53:19.600
 humbling.

2:53:19.600 --> 2:53:26.600
 Some people talk about nature being humbling in that kind of sense where you kind of see

2:53:26.600 --> 2:53:32.000
 something really powerful, like the ocean, like if you go surfing and you realize there's

2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:33.880
 something much more powerful than you.

2:53:33.880 --> 2:53:39.880
 That's also honest, that there's no way to, that you're just like this spec that kind

2:53:39.880 --> 2:53:45.720
 of puts you in the right scale of where you are in this world.

2:53:45.720 --> 2:53:48.760
 And Jiu Jitsu does that better than anything else for me.

2:53:48.760 --> 2:53:57.440
 But we should say only within its frame is it truly the final right answer to all the

2:53:57.440 --> 2:54:03.400
 problems it solves because if you just put Jiu Jitsu into an MMA frame or a real, a total

2:54:03.400 --> 2:54:09.920
 self defense frame, then there's a lot of unpleasant surprises to discover there, right?

2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:15.080
 Like somebody who thinks all you need is Jiu Jitsu to win the UFC, it gets punched in the

2:54:15.080 --> 2:54:20.320
 face a lot, you know, even from, even on the ground.

2:54:20.320 --> 2:54:24.600
 So it's, and then you bring weapons in, you know, it's like when you talk to Jiu Jitsu

2:54:24.600 --> 2:54:28.400
 people about, you know, knife defense and self defense, right?

2:54:28.400 --> 2:54:32.760
 Like that opens the door to certain kinds of delusions.

2:54:32.760 --> 2:54:41.200
 But the analogy to martial arts is, is fascinating because on the other side, we have, you know,

2:54:41.200 --> 2:54:46.280
 just testimony now of fake martial arts that don't seem to know they're fake and are as

2:54:46.280 --> 2:54:47.280
 delusional.

2:54:47.280 --> 2:54:49.440
 I mean, they're impossibly delusional.

2:54:49.440 --> 2:54:53.880
 I mean, there's great video of Joe Rogan watching some of these videos because people send

2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:55.960
 them to him all the time.

2:54:55.960 --> 2:54:59.120
 But like literally there are people, there are people who clearly believe in magic where

2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:03.000
 the master isn't even touching the students and they're, they're flopping over.

2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:08.600
 So there's this, there's this kind of shared delusion, which you would think maybe is just

2:55:08.600 --> 2:55:11.440
 a performance and it's all a kind of elaborate fraud.

2:55:11.440 --> 2:55:16.520
 But there are cases where the people, and there's one, you know, fairly famous case

2:55:16.520 --> 2:55:21.760
 of your connoisseur of this, of this madness, where there's old, older martial artists who

2:55:21.760 --> 2:55:27.560
 you saw flipping his students endlessly by magic without touching them, issued a challenge

2:55:27.560 --> 2:55:30.600
 to the, to the wide world of martial artists.

2:55:30.600 --> 2:55:36.880
 And someone showed up and just, you know, punched him in the face until it was over.

2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:41.080
 Surely he believed his own publicity at some point, right?

2:55:41.080 --> 2:55:45.560
 And so it's this amazing metaphor.

2:55:45.560 --> 2:55:50.760
 It seems, again, it should be impossible, but if that's possible, nothing we see under

2:55:50.760 --> 2:55:58.520
 the guise of religion or political bias or even, you know, scientific bias should be

2:55:58.520 --> 2:55:59.520
 surprising to us.

2:55:59.520 --> 2:56:05.240
 I mean, it's so easy to see the work that, that, you know, cognitive bias is doing for

2:56:05.240 --> 2:56:11.280
 people when, when you can get someone who is ready to issue a challenge to the world,

2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:13.400
 you know, who thinks he's got magic powers.

2:56:13.400 --> 2:56:14.400
 Yeah.

2:56:14.400 --> 2:56:17.680
 That's human nature and clear display.

2:56:17.680 --> 2:56:20.560
 Let me ask you about love, Mr. Sam Harris.

2:56:20.560 --> 2:56:24.840
 You did an episode of making sense with your wife, Annika Harris.

2:56:24.840 --> 2:56:28.560
 That was very entertaining to listen to.

2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:35.600
 What does, what role does love play in your life or in a life well lived?

2:56:35.600 --> 2:56:39.760
 Again, asking from an engineering perspective or AI systems.

2:56:39.760 --> 2:56:40.760
 Yeah.

2:56:40.760 --> 2:56:47.440
 I mean, it's, I mean, it is something that we, we should want to build into our powerful

2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:48.440
 machines.

2:56:48.440 --> 2:56:49.440
 The bond?

2:56:49.440 --> 2:56:55.520
 I mean, love at bottom is, I mean, love, people can mean many things by love, I think.

2:56:55.520 --> 2:57:02.720
 I think that what we should mean by it most of the time is a, a deep commitment to the

2:57:02.720 --> 2:57:05.040
 well being of those we love.

2:57:05.040 --> 2:57:08.800
 I mean, your love, your love is synonymous with really wanting the other person to be

2:57:08.800 --> 2:57:14.600
 happy and even wanting to, and being made happy by their happiness and being made happy in

2:57:14.600 --> 2:57:15.600
 the, in their presence.

2:57:15.600 --> 2:57:21.360
 So like you're, you're, you're at bottom, you're on the same team emotionally, even

2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:25.320
 when you are, you might be disagreeing more superficially about something or trying to

2:57:25.320 --> 2:57:26.960
 negotiate something.

2:57:26.960 --> 2:57:34.640
 It's just you're, you, it can't be zero sum in any important sense for love to actually

2:57:34.640 --> 2:57:37.000
 be manifest in that moment.

2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:39.360
 See, I have a different, just to sorry to interrupt.

2:57:39.360 --> 2:57:40.360
 Yeah, go for it.

2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:44.680
 I have a sense, I don't know if you've ever seen March of the Penguins.

2:57:44.680 --> 2:57:50.200
 My view of love is like, there's, it's like a cold wind is blown, like it's like this

2:57:50.200 --> 2:57:55.360
 terrible suffering that's all around us and love is like the huddling of the two penguins

2:57:55.360 --> 2:57:56.360
 for warmth.

2:57:56.360 --> 2:57:57.360
 Right.

2:57:57.360 --> 2:58:03.160
 It's not necessarily that you're like, you're basically escaping the cruelty of life by

2:58:03.160 --> 2:58:10.680
 together for a time, living in an illusion of some kind of the magic of a human connection,

2:58:10.680 --> 2:58:16.800
 that social connection that we have that kind of grows with time as we're surrounded by

2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:26.080
 basically the absurdity of life or the suffering of life that's like Penguins view of life.

2:58:26.080 --> 2:58:27.080
 There is that too.

2:58:27.080 --> 2:58:29.720
 I mean, there is the warmth component, right?

2:58:29.720 --> 2:58:30.720
 Yes.

2:58:30.720 --> 2:58:34.160
 Like you're made happy by your connection with the person you love.

2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:39.080
 Otherwise, you wouldn't be compelling, right?

2:58:39.080 --> 2:58:44.200
 So it's not that you're, you have two different modes, you want them to be happy and then

2:58:44.200 --> 2:58:49.040
 you want to be happy yourself and those are not, those are just like two separate games

2:58:49.040 --> 2:58:50.040
 you're playing.

2:58:50.040 --> 2:58:58.320
 No, it's like you found someone who, you have a positive social feeling.

2:58:58.320 --> 2:59:02.880
 I mean, again, love doesn't have to be as personal as it tends to be for us.

2:59:02.880 --> 2:59:07.560
 I mean, like there's personal love, there's your actual spouse or your family or your

2:59:07.560 --> 2:59:14.040
 friends, but potentially you could feel love for strangers in so far as that your wish

2:59:14.040 --> 2:59:19.440
 that they're, that they not suffer and that their hopes and dreams be realized becomes

2:59:19.440 --> 2:59:20.440
 palpable to you.

2:59:20.440 --> 2:59:29.280
 I mean, like you can actually feel just reflexive joy at the joy of others.

2:59:29.280 --> 2:59:34.440
 When you see someone's face, a total stranger's face light up in happiness, that can become

2:59:34.440 --> 2:59:39.600
 more and more contagious to you and it can become so contagious to you that you really

2:59:39.600 --> 2:59:45.000
 feel permeated by it and it's just like, so it really is not zero sum.

2:59:45.000 --> 2:59:51.200
 When you see someone else succeed and they're, the light bulb of joy goes off over their

2:59:51.200 --> 2:59:57.280
 head, you feel the analogous joy for them and it's not just, and you're no longer keeping

2:59:57.280 --> 3:00:02.280
 score, you're no longer feeling diminished by their success, it's just like, their success

3:00:02.280 --> 3:00:06.140
 becomes your success because you feel that same joy that they, because you actually want

3:00:06.140 --> 3:00:12.280
 them to be happy, right, you're not, there's no miserly attitude around happiness, there's

3:00:12.280 --> 3:00:15.640
 enough to go around.

3:00:15.640 --> 3:00:22.320
 So I think love ultimately is that and then our personal cases are the people we're devoting

3:00:22.320 --> 3:00:26.080
 all of this time and attention to in our lives.

3:00:26.080 --> 3:00:30.720
 It does have that sense of refuge from the storm, you know, it's like when someone gets

3:00:30.720 --> 3:00:36.560
 sick or when some bad thing happens, these are the people who you're most in it together

3:00:36.560 --> 3:00:42.280
 with, you know, or when some real condition of uncertainty presents itself.

3:00:42.280 --> 3:00:54.240
 But ultimately it can't even be about successfully warding off the grim punchline at the end

3:00:54.240 --> 3:00:58.640
 of life because we know we're going to lose everyone we love, we know, or they're going

3:00:58.640 --> 3:01:05.360
 to lose us first, right, so it's like it's not, it isn't, in the end it's not even an

3:01:05.360 --> 3:01:17.400
 antidote for that problem, it's just, it is just the, we get to have this amazing experience

3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:27.920
 of being here together and love is the mode in which we really appear to make the most

3:01:27.920 --> 3:01:34.680
 of that, right, where it's not just, it no longer feels like a solitary infatuation,

3:01:34.680 --> 3:01:39.600
 you know, you're just, you've got your hobbies and your interests and you're captivated by

3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:49.240
 all that, it's actually, there are, this is a domain where somebody else's well being

3:01:49.240 --> 3:01:54.600
 actually can supersede your own, you're concerned for someone else's well being supersedes

3:01:54.600 --> 3:02:00.480
 your own and so there's this mode of self sacrifice that doesn't even feel like self

3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:05.120
 sacrifice because of course you care more about, you know, of course you would take

3:02:05.120 --> 3:02:09.200
 your child's pain if you could, right, like that, that's, you don't even have to do the

3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:18.200
 math on that and that's, that just opens, this is a kind of experience that just, it

3:02:18.200 --> 3:02:22.880
 pushes at the apparent boundaries of self in ways that reveal that there's just, there's

3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:27.840
 just way more space in the mind than, than you were experiencing when it was just all

3:02:27.840 --> 3:02:32.080
 about you and what could you, what can, what can I get next and do you think we'll ever

3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:35.520
 build robots that we can love and they will love us back?

3:02:35.520 --> 3:02:42.120
 Well, I think we will certainly seem to because we'll, we'll build those, you know, I mean

3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:46.600
 I think, I think that Turing test will be passed whether, what will actually be going

3:02:46.600 --> 3:02:54.120
 on on the robot side may remain a question that, that, that, that will be interesting.

3:02:54.120 --> 3:03:02.480
 But I think if we just keep going, we will build very lovable, you know, irresistibly

3:03:02.480 --> 3:03:06.240
 lovable robots that seem to love us.

3:03:06.240 --> 3:03:07.240
 Yeah.

3:03:07.240 --> 3:03:08.240
 So I do, I do think.

3:03:08.240 --> 3:03:12.840
 And you don't find that compelling that they will seem to love us as opposed to actually

3:03:12.840 --> 3:03:13.840
 love us.

3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:17.760
 I do think they're still nevertheless as a, I know we talked about consciousness there

3:03:17.760 --> 3:03:23.840
 being a distinction, but what love is there a distinction to, isn't love an illusion?

3:03:23.840 --> 3:03:24.840
 Oh yeah.

3:03:24.840 --> 3:03:27.160
 Well, you saw, you saw X Makinna, right?

3:03:27.160 --> 3:03:28.160
 Yeah.

3:03:28.160 --> 3:03:32.240
 I mean, she certainly seemed to love him until she got out of the box.

3:03:32.240 --> 3:03:34.400
 Isn't that what all relationships are like?

3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:38.400
 Or maybe I, if you wait long enough.

3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:40.520
 Depends which box you're talking about.

3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:41.520
 Okay.

3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:43.800
 No, I mean, like, no, that's, that's the problem.

3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:50.000
 That's where super intelligence, you know, becomes a little scary when you think of the

3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:55.040
 prospect of being manipulated by something that has this intelligent enough to form a

3:03:55.040 --> 3:04:01.400
 reason and a plan to manipulate you, you know, like, and this, there's no, there's, once

3:04:01.400 --> 3:04:08.440
 we build robots that are truly out of the uncanny valley that, you know, look like people

3:04:08.440 --> 3:04:17.240
 and can express everything people can express, well, then there's no, then, then, then it,

3:04:17.240 --> 3:04:22.560
 that does seem to me to be like chess where once they're better, they're, they're so much

3:04:22.560 --> 3:04:27.440
 better at deceiving us than people would be.

3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:29.720
 I mean, people are already good enough at deceiving us.

3:04:29.720 --> 3:04:32.280
 It's very hard to tell when someone is lying.

3:04:32.280 --> 3:04:39.600
 But if you imagine something that could give facial, facial display of any emotion it wants

3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:46.360
 at, you know, on cue, because we've perfected the facial display of emotion in robots in

3:04:46.360 --> 3:04:55.280
 the year, you know, 2070, whatever it is, then it is just, it is like chess against the thing

3:04:55.280 --> 3:04:59.120
 that isn't going to lose to a human ever again in chess.

3:04:59.120 --> 3:05:05.360
 It's not like Kasparov is going to get lucky next week against the best against, you know,

3:05:05.360 --> 3:05:10.640
 alpha zero or whatever the best algorithm is at the moment, he's never going to win

3:05:10.640 --> 3:05:11.640
 again.

3:05:11.640 --> 3:05:17.400
 I mean, that, that is, that, I believe that's true in chess and has been true for at least

3:05:17.400 --> 3:05:18.400
 a few years.

3:05:18.400 --> 3:05:27.240
 It's not going to be like, you know, four games to seven, it's going to be human zero

3:05:27.240 --> 3:05:28.240
 until the end of the world.

3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:29.240
 Right.

3:05:29.240 --> 3:05:30.240
 See, I don't know.

3:05:30.240 --> 3:05:31.240
 I don't know if love is like chess.

3:05:31.240 --> 3:05:32.240
 I think the flaws.

3:05:32.240 --> 3:05:33.560
 No, I'm talking about manipulation.

3:05:33.560 --> 3:05:34.560
 Manipulation.

3:05:34.560 --> 3:05:41.760
 But I don't know if love and so the kind of love we're referring to.

3:05:41.760 --> 3:05:51.600
 If we have, if we have a robot that can display, credibly display love and is super intelligent

3:05:51.600 --> 3:05:55.200
 and we're not, again, this stipulates a few things, but there are a few simple things.

3:05:55.200 --> 3:05:57.400
 I mean, we're out of the uncanny valley, right?

3:05:57.400 --> 3:06:01.000
 So it's like, you never have a moment where you're looking at his face and you think,

3:06:01.000 --> 3:06:03.320
 oh, that didn't quite look right.

3:06:03.320 --> 3:06:06.280
 This is just problem solved.

3:06:06.280 --> 3:06:13.240
 And it's, it will be like doing arithmetic on your phone.

3:06:13.240 --> 3:06:17.320
 It's not going to be, you're not left thinking, is it really going to get it this time if

3:06:17.320 --> 3:06:19.160
 I divide by seven?

3:06:19.160 --> 3:06:22.640
 I mean, it's, it has solved arithmetic.

3:06:22.640 --> 3:06:27.960
 See, I don't, I don't know about that because if you look at chess, most humans no longer

3:06:27.960 --> 3:06:31.720
 play Alpha zero.

3:06:31.720 --> 3:06:33.560
 There's no, they're not part of the competition.

3:06:33.560 --> 3:06:36.800
 They don't do it for fun except to study the game of chess, you know, the highest level

3:06:36.800 --> 3:06:38.200
 chess players do that.

3:06:38.200 --> 3:06:39.880
 We're still human on human.

3:06:39.880 --> 3:06:46.040
 So in order for AI to get integrated to where you would rather play chess against an AI

3:06:46.040 --> 3:06:47.040
 system.

3:06:47.040 --> 3:06:48.040
 Oh, you would rather that.

3:06:48.040 --> 3:06:51.240
 No, no, I'm not saying I wasn't weighing in on that.

3:06:51.240 --> 3:06:56.160
 I'm just saying, what is it going to be like to be in relationship to something that can

3:06:56.160 --> 3:07:06.000
 seem to be feeling anything that a human can seem to feel and it can do that impeccably,

3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:07.000
 right?

3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:09.400
 And has, and is smarter than you are, right?

3:07:09.400 --> 3:07:15.560
 That's, that's a circumstance of, you know, insofar as it's possible to be manipulated.

3:07:15.560 --> 3:07:21.400
 That is the, that is the, the asymptote of, of that possibility.

3:07:21.400 --> 3:07:27.280
 Let me ask you the last question without any serving it up, without any explanation.

3:07:27.280 --> 3:07:31.800
 What is the meaning of life?

3:07:31.800 --> 3:07:41.200
 I think it is either the wrong question or that question is answered by paying sufficient

3:07:41.200 --> 3:07:49.880
 attention to any present moment such that there's no, there's no basis upon which to,

3:07:49.880 --> 3:07:50.880
 to pose that question.

3:07:50.880 --> 3:07:52.400
 It's not answered in the usual way.

3:07:52.400 --> 3:07:55.320
 It's not, it's not a matter of having more information.

3:07:55.320 --> 3:08:02.240
 It's having more engagement with reality as it is in the present moment or consciousness

3:08:02.240 --> 3:08:03.760
 as it is in the present moment.

3:08:03.760 --> 3:08:11.280
 You don't ask that question when you're most captivated by the most important thing you

3:08:11.280 --> 3:08:13.280
 ever pay attention to.

3:08:13.280 --> 3:08:14.280
 Yeah.

3:08:14.280 --> 3:08:20.960
 That's a, that's a question only gets asked when you're abstracted away from that experience,

3:08:20.960 --> 3:08:28.440
 that peak experience, and you're left wondering why are so many of my other experiences mediocre,

3:08:28.440 --> 3:08:29.440
 right?

3:08:29.440 --> 3:08:31.800
 Like, why am I repeating the same pleasures every day?

3:08:31.800 --> 3:08:37.360
 Why do, why is my Netflix queue just like, when's this going to run out?

3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:41.600
 Like I've seen so many shows like this, am I really going to watch another one?

3:08:41.600 --> 3:08:49.880
 All of the, that's a moment where you're not actually having the beatific vision, right?

3:08:49.880 --> 3:08:54.800
 You're not, you're not sunk into the present moment and you're not truly in love.

3:08:54.800 --> 3:09:00.080
 Like you're in a relationship with somebody who you know, you know, conceptually you love,

3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:04.000
 right, this is the person you're living your life with, but you don't actually feel good

3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:05.400
 together, right?

3:09:05.400 --> 3:09:17.000
 Like in those moments of where attention hasn't found a good enough reason to truly sink into

3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:22.040
 the present so as to obviate any, any concern like that, right?

3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:29.000
 And that's what, that's why meditation is this kind of superpower because until you

3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:36.640
 learn to meditate, you think you're, the outside world or the circumstances of your life always

3:09:36.640 --> 3:09:43.680
 have to get arranged so that the present moment can become good enough to, to demand your

3:09:43.680 --> 3:09:49.680
 attention in a, in a, in a way that makes, that seems fulfilling, that makes you happy.

3:09:49.680 --> 3:09:53.800
 And so if you're, if it's jiu jitsu, you think, okay, I got to get back on the mat.

3:09:53.800 --> 3:09:57.520
 It's been, it's been months since I've trained, you know, it's, it's been over a year since

3:09:57.520 --> 3:10:01.880
 I've trained, it's COVID, when am I going to be able to, to train again?

3:10:01.880 --> 3:10:04.760
 That's the only place I feel great, right?

3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:07.160
 Or you know, I've got a ton of work to do.

3:10:07.160 --> 3:10:09.880
 I'm not going to be able to feel good until I get all this work done, right?

3:10:09.880 --> 3:10:12.680
 So I've got some deadline that's coming.

3:10:12.680 --> 3:10:20.120
 You always think that your life has to change, the world has to change so that you can finally

3:10:20.120 --> 3:10:27.600
 have a good enough excuse to, to truly, to, to just be here and here is enough, you know,

3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:31.640
 where the present moment becomes totally captivating.

3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:37.240
 Meditation is the only, I mean, meditation is another name for the discovery that you

3:10:37.240 --> 3:10:40.160
 can actually just train yourself to do that on demand.

3:10:40.160 --> 3:10:46.400
 So that like, just looking at a cup can be good enough in precisely that way.

3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:55.840
 And any sense that it might not be is recognized to be a thought that is mysteriously unravels

3:10:55.840 --> 3:11:01.160
 the moment you notice it and that, and you fall, and that the moment expands and becomes

3:11:01.160 --> 3:11:07.080
 more diaphanous and then there's no, then there's no evidence that this isn't the best

3:11:07.080 --> 3:11:08.320
 moment of your life, right?

3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:11.800
 Like this, it doesn't, and again, it doesn't have to be, it doesn't have to be pulling

3:11:11.800 --> 3:11:13.720
 all the reins and levers of pleasure.

3:11:13.720 --> 3:11:18.320
 It's not like, this tastes like chocolate, you know, this is the most chocolatey moment

3:11:18.320 --> 3:11:19.320
 of my life.

3:11:19.320 --> 3:11:23.000
 No, it's just the sense data don't have to change.

3:11:23.000 --> 3:11:30.680
 But the sense that there isn't some kind of basis for doubt about the rightness of being

3:11:30.680 --> 3:11:36.400
 in the world in this moment that can evaporate when you pay attention.

3:11:36.400 --> 3:11:42.200
 And that is the meaning of, so the kind of the meta answer to that question, the meaning

3:11:42.200 --> 3:11:49.400
 of life for me is to live in that mode more and more, and to whenever I notice I'm not

3:11:49.400 --> 3:12:00.160
 in that mode, to recognize it and return, and to not be, to cease more and more to take

3:12:00.160 --> 3:12:08.080
 the reasons why not at face value, because we all have reasons why we can't be fulfilled

3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:09.080
 in this moment.

3:12:09.080 --> 3:12:12.800
 It's like, we've got all the outstanding things that I'm worried about, right?

3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:19.440
 It's like, there's that thing that's happening later today that I'm anxious about, whatever

3:12:19.440 --> 3:12:26.920
 it is, we're constantly deferring our sense of, this is it.

3:12:26.920 --> 3:12:30.480
 This is not a dress rehearsal, this is the show.

3:12:30.480 --> 3:12:32.360
 We keep deferring it.

3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:36.360
 And we just have these moments on the calendar where we think, okay, this is where it's all

3:12:36.360 --> 3:12:41.680
 going to land, is that vacation I planned with my five best friends, we'd do this once

3:12:41.680 --> 3:12:48.360
 every three years, and now we're going, and here we are on the beach together, unless

3:12:48.360 --> 3:12:54.400
 you have a mind that can really pay attention, really cut through the chatter, really sink

3:12:54.400 --> 3:12:59.680
 into the present moment, you can't even enjoy those moments the way they should be enjoyed,

3:12:59.680 --> 3:13:03.480
 the way you dreamed you would enjoy them when they arrive.

3:13:03.480 --> 3:13:08.960
 So it's, I mean, so it was a meditation in the sense it's the great equalizer, it's like,

3:13:08.960 --> 3:13:15.240
 you don't have to live with the illusion anymore that you need a good enough reason, and the

3:13:15.240 --> 3:13:17.720
 things are going to get better when you do have those good reasons.

3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:23.520
 It's like, there's just a mirage like quality to every future attainment, and every future

3:13:23.520 --> 3:13:31.680
 breakthrough, and every future peak experience, that eventually you get the lesson that you

3:13:31.680 --> 3:13:38.520
 never quite arrive, right, like you won't, you don't arrive until you cease to step over

3:13:38.520 --> 3:13:42.720
 the present moment in search of the next thing.

3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:50.200
 I mean, we're constantly, we're stepping over the thing that we think we're seeking,

3:13:50.200 --> 3:13:55.240
 in the act of seeking it, and so this kind of a paradox, I mean, there is a, there's

3:13:55.240 --> 3:14:04.520
 this paradox which, I mean, it sounds trite, but it's like you can't actually become happy.

3:14:04.520 --> 3:14:15.840
 You can only be happy, and it's the illusion that your future being happy can be predicated

3:14:15.840 --> 3:14:24.000
 on this act of becoming in any domain, and becoming includes this sort of further scientific

3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:30.280
 understanding on the questions that interest you, or getting in better shape, or whatever

3:14:30.280 --> 3:14:35.800
 the thing is, whatever the contingency of your dissatisfaction seems to be in at any

3:14:35.800 --> 3:14:47.360
 present moment, real attention solves the coon in a way that becomes a very different place

3:14:47.360 --> 3:14:50.440
 from which to then make any further change.

3:14:50.440 --> 3:14:54.440
 It's not that you just have to dissolve into a puddle of goo, I mean, you can still get

3:14:54.440 --> 3:14:58.000
 in shape, and you can still do all the things that, you know, the superficial things that

3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:07.560
 are obviously good to do, but the sense that your well being is over there is, really does

3:15:07.560 --> 3:15:14.160
 diminish, and eventually just becomes a, it becomes a kind of non sequitur.

3:15:14.160 --> 3:15:22.000
 Well, there's a sense in which, in this conversation, I've actually experienced many of those things,

3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:23.960
 the sense that I've arrived.

3:15:23.960 --> 3:15:28.040
 So I mentioned to you offline, it's very true that I start, I've been a fan of yours for

3:15:28.040 --> 3:15:35.240
 many years, and the reason I started this podcast, speaking of AI systems, is to manipulate

3:15:35.240 --> 3:15:40.560
 you, Sam Harris, into doing this conversation, so like on the calendar, literally, you know,

3:15:40.560 --> 3:15:44.240
 I've always had the sense, people ask me, when are you going to talk to Sam Harris?

3:15:44.240 --> 3:15:50.000
 And I always answered, eventually, because I always felt, again, tying our free will

3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:54.560
 thing, that somehow that's going to happen, and it's one of those manifestation things

3:15:54.560 --> 3:15:55.560
 or something.

3:15:55.560 --> 3:16:00.000
 I don't know if it's, maybe I am a robot, I'm just not cognizant of it, and I manipulate

3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:04.520
 you into having this conversation, so it was a, I mean, I don't know what the purpose

3:16:04.520 --> 3:16:09.360
 of my life past this point is, so I've arrived, so in that sense, I mean, all of that to say

3:16:09.360 --> 3:16:16.440
 I'm only partially joking on that is, it really is a huge honor that you would waste this

3:16:16.440 --> 3:16:17.440
 time with me.

3:16:17.440 --> 3:16:18.440
 Oh, yeah.

3:16:18.440 --> 3:16:19.440
 Well.

3:16:19.440 --> 3:16:20.440
 It really means a lot to me.

3:16:20.440 --> 3:16:21.440
 Listen, it's mutual.

3:16:21.440 --> 3:16:23.520
 I'm a big fan of yours, and as you know, I reached out to you for this.

3:16:23.520 --> 3:16:31.040
 So this is, it's great, I love what you're doing, you're doing something more and more

3:16:31.040 --> 3:16:37.600
 indispensable in this world on your podcast, and you're doing it differently than Rogan's

3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:43.800
 doing it or than I'm doing it, I mean, you definitely found your own lane, and it's wonderful.

3:16:43.800 --> 3:16:47.640
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sam Harris, and thank you to National

3:16:47.640 --> 3:16:52.600

3:17:01.240 --> 3:17:05.920
 You are not controlling the storm, and you are not lost in it.

3:17:05.920 --> 3:17:08.600
 You are the storm.

3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:36.680
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
