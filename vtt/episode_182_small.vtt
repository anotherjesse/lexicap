00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
 The following is a conversation with John Donahar.

00:02.800 --> 00:06.000
 Widely acknowledged is one of the greatest coaches

00:06.000 --> 00:08.720
 and minds in the martial arts world.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.320
 Having coached many champions in Jiu Jitsu,

00:11.320 --> 00:13.520
 submission grappling and MMA,

00:13.520 --> 00:18.000
 including Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonan, Nick Rodriguez,

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
 Craig Jones, Nicky Ryan, Chris Weidman, and George St. Pierre.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.120
 Quick mention of our sponsors.

00:25.120 --> 00:28.960
 On It, Simply Safe, Indeed, and Lunode.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.320
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.240
 As a side note, let me say that John is a scholar

00:35.240 --> 00:38.200
 of not just Jiu Jitsu, but Judo, wrestling,

00:38.200 --> 00:40.720
 Muay Thai, boxing, and MMA,

00:40.720 --> 00:45.040
 and outside of that, topics of history, psychology,

00:45.040 --> 00:48.240
 philosophy, and even artificial intelligence,

00:48.240 --> 00:50.660
 as you'll hear in this conversation.

00:50.660 --> 00:54.560
 After this chat, I started to entertain the possibility

00:54.560 --> 00:57.200
 of returning back to competition as a black belt,

00:57.200 --> 00:59.280
 maybe even training with John and his team

00:59.280 --> 01:02.240
 for a few weeks leading up to the competition.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.880
 For a recreational practitioner, such as myself,

01:05.880 --> 01:08.360
 the value of training and competing in Jiu Jitsu

01:08.360 --> 01:11.620
 is that it is one of the best ways to get humbled.

01:11.620 --> 01:14.640
 To me, keeping an ego in check is essential

01:14.640 --> 01:17.400
 for a productive and happy life.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.000
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.600
 and here is my conversation with John Donahar.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.800
 Are you afraid of death?

01:26.800 --> 01:29.200
 Let's start with an easy question.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.040
 There's no warmup.

01:30.040 --> 01:30.880
 That's it.

01:30.880 --> 01:31.720
 No warmup.

01:31.720 --> 01:32.720
 They're jumping jacks.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.160
 Let's break that down into two questions.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.640
 I'm a human being, and like any human being,

01:40.640 --> 01:45.440
 I'm biologically programmed to be terrified of death.

01:45.440 --> 01:49.400
 Every physical element in our bodies

01:49.400 --> 01:52.240
 is designed to keep us away from death.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.880
 I'm no different from anyone else in that regard.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.360
 If you throw me from the top of the Empire State Building,

01:58.360 --> 02:01.240
 I'm gonna scream all the way down to the concrete.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.760
 If you wave a loaded firearm in my face,

02:03.760 --> 02:05.440
 I'm gonna flinch away and horror

02:05.440 --> 02:07.120
 the same way anyone else would.

02:09.080 --> 02:13.360
 So in that first sense of, are you afraid of death?

02:15.320 --> 02:18.760
 My body is terrified of injury leading to death

02:18.760 --> 02:21.720
 the same way any other human being would.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.440
 So when death is imminent, there's a terror that...

02:24.440 --> 02:26.560
 Yeah, I go through the same adrenaline dumps

02:26.560 --> 02:27.760
 that you would go through.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.720
 But on the other hand, you're also asking

02:30.720 --> 02:33.720
 a much deeper question, which is, presumably,

02:33.720 --> 02:35.560
 are you afraid of nonexistence?

02:35.560 --> 02:37.520
 What comes after your physical death?

02:37.520 --> 02:39.600
 And that's the more interesting question.

02:40.520 --> 02:45.520
 No, I should start by saying from the start,

02:47.280 --> 02:48.360
 I'm a materialist.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.160
 I don't believe that we have an immortal soul.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.160
 I don't believe there's a life after our physical death.

02:53.160 --> 02:55.800
 In this sense, from someone who starts

02:55.800 --> 02:58.800
 from that point of view, you have to understand

02:58.800 --> 03:03.040
 that everyone has two deaths.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.480
 We always talk about our death, as though there was only one.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.240
 But we all have two deaths.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.280
 There was a time before you were born when you were dead.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.160
 You weren't afraid of that period of nonexistence.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.760
 You don't even think about it.

03:22.760 --> 03:25.760
 So why would you be afraid of your second period

03:25.760 --> 03:27.080
 of nonexistence?

03:27.080 --> 03:30.200
 You came from nonexistence, you're going to go back into it.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.880
 You weren't afraid of the first.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.400
 Why are you somehow afraid of the second?

03:34.400 --> 03:36.440
 So it doesn't really make sense to me

03:36.440 --> 03:39.720
 as to why people would be afraid of nonexistence.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.480
 You dealt with it fine the first time,

03:41.480 --> 03:43.400
 deal with it the second time.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.400
 But your mind didn't exist for the first death.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.600
 And it won't exist after you die, either.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.000
 But it does exist now enough to comprehend

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
 that there's this thing that you know nothing about

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
 that's coming, which is nonexistence.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.240
 Actually, you do know about it

03:58.240 --> 04:00.360
 because you know what it was like before you were born.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.600
 It was just nothing.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.000
 Every time you go to sleep at night,

04:04.000 --> 04:05.600
 you get a sneak preview of death.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.600
 It's just this kind of nothing happens.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.000
 You wake up in the morning, you're alive again.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.200
 But it's not about the sleeping.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.240
 It's about the falling asleep.

04:16.240 --> 04:20.600
 Falling asleep, and every night when you fall asleep,

04:20.600 --> 04:22.880
 you assume you're going to wake up.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.800
 Here you know you're not waking up.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.640
 And the knowledge of that.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.200
 But there's a whole step from that

04:28.200 --> 04:29.920
 to the idea of fear in it.

04:29.920 --> 04:33.480
 I'm fully aware that there's gonna be a time I don't wake up.

04:33.480 --> 04:34.800
 But are you gonna be afraid of it?

04:34.800 --> 04:36.680
 Is there some mortal terror you have of this?

04:36.680 --> 04:38.080
 No, you didn't have it before.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.160
 You don't have it when you sleep.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.080
 Going from the fact that you know you won't wake up

04:43.080 --> 04:45.080
 to terror is two different things.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.480
 It's an extra step.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.920
 And at that point, you're making a choice at that point.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.080
 What about what some people in this context,

04:54.080 --> 04:55.840
 we might call like the third death,

04:55.840 --> 05:00.840
 which is when everybody forgets

05:01.000 --> 05:03.240
 the entirety of consciousness in the universe

05:03.240 --> 05:04.760
 forgets that you've ever existed,

05:04.760 --> 05:07.480
 that John Donahue ever existed.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.920
 So it's almost like a cosmic death.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.160
 It's like everything goes, yeah.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.600
 Not just, I would say it's like knowledge,

05:15.600 --> 05:17.840
 the history books forget about who you are

05:17.840 --> 05:19.040
 because the history books.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.320
 This is inevitable, by the way.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.880
 We're all very, very small players in a very big game.

05:23.880 --> 05:27.680
 And inevitably, we're all going to go at some point.

05:28.840 --> 05:31.680
 Yeah, but doesn't, do you're...

05:31.680 --> 05:33.200
 It's disappointing, of course.

05:33.200 --> 05:38.200
 But it's not even, it really arrogance to say,

05:38.360 --> 05:40.640
 I'm disappointed in the idea that I will disappear.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.240
 There's far greater things than me that will disappear.

05:43.240 --> 05:48.240
 I mean, it's crushing to think that there's gonna come a time

05:48.520 --> 05:51.920
 where no one will ever hear Beethoven's symphonies again.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.880
 That the mysteries of the pharaohs will be lost

05:54.880 --> 05:57.160
 and no one will even comprehend that they once existed.

05:57.160 --> 06:01.440
 Like humanity has come up with so many amazing things

06:01.440 --> 06:02.680
 over its existence.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.000
 And to think that one day,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.760
 this is just all happening on a tiny speck

06:07.760 --> 06:11.280
 in a distant corner of a very small galaxy

06:11.280 --> 06:15.040
 and among millions of galaxies that this is all for nothing.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.120
 Okay, I can understand.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.240
 There's a kind of dread that comes with this.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.800
 But there's also a sense in which the moment you're born

06:22.800 --> 06:24.520
 and the moment you can think about these things,

06:24.520 --> 06:26.880
 you know this is your inevitable fate.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.040
 Is it so inevitable?

06:28.040 --> 06:30.280
 So if we look at, we're in Austin

06:30.280 --> 06:33.760
 and there's a guy named Elon Musk and he's hoping,

06:33.760 --> 06:36.840
 in fact, that is the drive behind many of his passions

06:36.840 --> 06:40.760
 is the human beings becoming multi planetary species

06:40.760 --> 06:44.200
 and expanding out, exploring and colonizing

06:44.200 --> 06:46.680
 the solar system, the galaxy

06:46.680 --> 06:48.880
 and maybe the rest of the universe.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.800
 Is that something that fills you with excitement?

06:51.800 --> 06:54.120
 It's as a project, it's very exciting.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.000
 I, the whole idea, I mean, we all grew up

06:58.000 --> 07:02.640
 with science fiction, the idea of exploration

07:02.640 --> 07:06.480
 the same way human beings in earlier centuries

07:06.480 --> 07:08.760
 were thrilled at the idea of discovering a new world,

07:08.760 --> 07:10.920
 you know, America or some other part of the world

07:10.920 --> 07:13.560
 that they sailed to and come back.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.040
 But now instead of sailing oceans,

07:15.040 --> 07:16.640
 you're sailing solar systems

07:16.640 --> 07:20.440
 and ultimately even further.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.880
 So of course that's exciting,

07:21.880 --> 07:25.080
 but as far as relieving us from non existence,

07:25.080 --> 07:26.960
 it's just playing a delaying game

07:26.960 --> 07:30.040
 because ultimately even the universe itself

07:30.040 --> 07:31.920
 if the laws of thermodynamics are correct,

07:31.920 --> 07:33.320
 we'll ultimately die.

07:33.320 --> 07:38.320
 Of course we might not understand most of the physics

07:40.400 --> 07:42.600
 and how the universe functions.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.120
 You said laws of thermodynamics,

07:44.120 --> 07:47.000
 but maybe that's just a tiny little fraction

07:47.000 --> 07:49.080
 of what the universe actually is.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.360
 Maybe there's multiple dimensions,

07:50.360 --> 07:52.920
 maybe there's multiple universes,

07:52.920 --> 07:55.520
 maybe the entirety of this experience.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.360
 You know, there's guys like Donald Hoffman

07:57.360 --> 07:59.440
 that think that all of this is just an illusion

07:59.440 --> 08:03.720
 that we don't, like human cognition and perception

08:03.720 --> 08:05.600
 constructs a whole, it's like a video game

08:05.600 --> 08:07.080
 that we construct that's very distant

08:07.080 --> 08:08.600
 from the actual reality.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.680
 And maybe one day we'll understand that reality,

08:10.680 --> 08:12.760
 maybe it'll be like the matrix kind of thing.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.120
 So there's a lot of different possibilities here.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.880
 And there's also a philosopher named Ernest Becker.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.320
 I don't know if you know that is.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.560
 He wrote Denial of Death.

08:22.560 --> 08:26.000
 And his idea, he disagrees with you, but he's dead now.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
 Is that he thinks that the terror of death,

08:31.920 --> 08:35.400
 the terror of the knowledge that we're going to die

08:35.400 --> 08:38.040
 is within all of us and is in fact the driver

08:38.040 --> 08:41.480
 behind most of the creativity that we do.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.600
 Exploring out into the universe,

08:43.600 --> 08:47.840
 but also you becoming one of the great scholars

08:47.840 --> 08:49.360
 of the martial arts.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.560
 The philosophers of fighting

08:52.560 --> 08:55.440
 is because you're actually terrified of death

08:55.440 --> 09:00.440
 and you want to somehow permeate like your knowledge,

09:00.920 --> 09:05.480
 your ideas, your essence to permeate human civilization

09:05.480 --> 09:09.560
 so that even when your body dies, you live on.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.120
 I would agree with him insofar as death

09:14.120 --> 09:18.040
 is the single greatest motivator for action.

09:18.040 --> 09:22.080
 But going beyond that and saying that it's somehow terrifying,

09:22.080 --> 09:24.160
 that's an extra step on his part.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.520
 And not everyone's going to follow him on that step.

09:27.520 --> 09:32.520
 I do believe that death is the single most important element

09:34.040 --> 09:37.280
 in life that gives value to our days.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.880
 If you think, for example, of a situation

09:40.880 --> 09:44.320
 where a God came to you and gave you immortality,

09:46.360 --> 09:48.480
 life would be very, very different for you.

09:48.480 --> 09:53.480
 You're a talented research scientist, you work to a schedule.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.760
 Why?

09:56.760 --> 09:59.280
 Because ultimately you know your life is finite

09:59.280 --> 10:01.160
 and actually very finite.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.800
 And could be even more so if fate plays its hand

10:05.800 --> 10:08.960
 and you die an early death or what have you,

10:08.960 --> 10:11.160
 we never know what's going to happen tomorrow.

10:11.160 --> 10:16.160
 As such, we get work done as soon as we can.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.400
 The moment you gain immortality,

10:21.400 --> 10:24.000
 you can always put every project off.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
 You can always say, I don't need to do this today

10:26.000 --> 10:30.160
 because I can do it four centuries from now.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.400
 And as you extend artificially a human life,

10:33.400 --> 10:36.160
 the motivation to get things done here and now

10:36.160 --> 10:40.360
 and work industriously and excel fades away

10:40.360 --> 10:42.760
 because you can always come back to the idea

10:42.760 --> 10:45.160
 that you can do this in the future.

10:45.160 --> 10:50.000
 And so what gives value to our days is ultimately death.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
 And value, it's not the only reason behind value,

10:55.520 --> 10:59.560
 but a huge part of what we consider value as scarcity.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.160
 And death gives us scarcity of days.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.720
 And it's probably the single greatest motivator

11:04.720 --> 11:07.480
 for almost every action we've taken.

11:07.480 --> 11:10.280
 It's kind of tragic and beautiful

11:10.280 --> 11:15.280
 that what makes things amazing is that they end.

11:19.080 --> 11:22.520
 Yeah, I think it would actually be a terrible burden

11:22.520 --> 11:23.680
 to be immortal.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.480
 Life would be in many ways,

11:28.480 --> 11:30.920
 very hollow and meaningless, I think.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.200
 People talk about death taking away the meaning of life,

11:34.200 --> 11:37.460
 but I think immortality would have a very similar effect

11:37.460 --> 11:38.740
 on a different direction.

11:42.120 --> 11:45.380
 So given this short life,

11:47.080 --> 11:48.360
 we could think about Jiu Jitsu,

11:48.360 --> 11:51.320
 we can think about any kind of pursuit.

11:51.320 --> 11:53.280
 What do you think makes a great life?

11:54.360 --> 11:59.120
 Is it the highest peak of achievement?

12:00.200 --> 12:03.120
 You know, you think about like an Olympic gold medal,

12:03.120 --> 12:05.160
 the highest level of performance,

12:05.160 --> 12:08.560
 or is it the longevity of performance,

12:08.560 --> 12:12.220
 of doing many amazing things and doing it for a long time?

12:12.220 --> 12:15.400
 I think the latter is kind of what we talk about

12:15.400 --> 12:18.200
 in at least American society.

12:18.200 --> 12:22.620
 You know, we want people to be healthy, balanced,

12:22.620 --> 12:25.360
 perform well for a long time.

12:25.360 --> 12:30.360
 And then there's maybe like the gladiator ethic,

12:30.440 --> 12:33.800
 which is the highest peak is what defines.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.440
 You asked an initial question,

12:35.440 --> 12:37.600
 which what makes a great life,

12:37.600 --> 12:40.600
 but then pointed towards two options,

12:40.600 --> 12:43.480
 one of longevity versus degree of difficulty.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.840
 There's gotta be a lot more than that, surely.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.200
 I mean, think about,

12:50.600 --> 12:52.360
 first of all, we have to understand from the start

12:52.360 --> 12:55.080
 that there's never gonna be an agreed upon set of criteria.

12:55.080 --> 12:58.680
 If this is a great life from all perspective,

12:58.680 --> 13:00.840
 if you look from the perspective of say,

13:00.840 --> 13:03.920
 Machiavelli, then Stalin lived a great life.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.000
 He was highly successful at what he did.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.400
 He started from nothing.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.480
 So the degree of difficulty and what he did

13:10.480 --> 13:12.400
 was extraordinarily high.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.800
 He had massive impact upon world history.

13:15.800 --> 13:20.240
 He oversaw the defeat of almost all of his major enemies.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.640
 He lived to old age and died of natural causes.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.920
 So from Machiavelli's point of view, he had a great life.

13:26.920 --> 13:30.000
 If you ask the Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s,

13:30.000 --> 13:31.040
 whether he lived a great life,

13:31.040 --> 13:32.600
 you get a very different answer.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.360
 So everything's gonna come from more perspective.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.720
 You begin with this,

13:37.720 --> 13:39.040
 you're going to look out at the world

13:39.040 --> 13:40.040
 with a given point of view

13:40.040 --> 13:41.200
 and you're gonna make your judgments.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.920
 Was this a great life or was this a terrible life?

13:45.920 --> 13:47.240
 Going back to your point,

13:47.240 --> 13:48.960
 you were actually, I think,

13:48.960 --> 13:52.360
 focusing the question on more in terms of

13:54.280 --> 13:57.320
 great single performances versus longevity performances.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.480
 Yes.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.360
 Presumably this isn't really a question

14:00.360 --> 14:03.320
 about what makes a great life then

14:03.320 --> 14:06.880
 because there's so much more than that to a great life.

14:06.880 --> 14:07.720
 I don't know.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.800
 I'm gonna push back on that.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.400
 So I think the parallels are very much closer

14:11.400 --> 14:13.040
 than you're making them seem.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.840
 I think it's, let's compare Stalin.

14:14.840 --> 14:18.360
 Stalin is an example of somebody who held power

14:18.360 --> 14:22.000
 considered by many to be one of the most powerful men ever.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.080
 He held power for 30 years.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.000
 So that's what I'm referring to longevity.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.840
 And then there's a few people,

14:27.840 --> 14:31.080
 I wish my knowledge of history was better,

14:31.080 --> 14:34.800
 but people who fought a few great battles

14:34.800 --> 14:37.800
 and they did not maintain power, but they were.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.240
 Let's contrast here, for example,

14:39.240 --> 14:42.480
 Alexander the Great who died at 33

14:43.440 --> 14:45.480
 from probably unnatural causes

14:48.360 --> 14:53.360
 had around four to five truly defining battles in his life,

14:53.360 --> 14:58.360
 which responsible for the lion's share of his achievements

14:59.840 --> 15:03.960
 and burned very bright, but didn't burn long.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.040
 Stalin, on the other hand, started from nothing

15:07.040 --> 15:09.080
 and quietly, methodically worked his way

15:09.080 --> 15:10.480
 through the revolutionary phase

15:10.480 --> 15:13.920
 and gained increasing amounts of power.

15:13.920 --> 15:18.920
 And as he said, went all the way to the end of his career.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.640
 Yeah, there's definitely something to be said

15:22.640 --> 15:27.640
 for longevity, but as to which one is greater than the other,

15:29.880 --> 15:34.880
 you can't give a definition or a set of criteria

15:36.480 --> 15:39.520
 which will definitively say, this is better than that.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.960
 But ultimately, we look at Alexander as great,

15:41.960 --> 15:42.800
 but in a different way.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.320
 And we look at Stalin,

15:44.320 --> 15:45.200
 I didn't think many people would say

15:45.200 --> 15:46.200
 Stalin was a great person,

15:46.200 --> 15:48.280
 but from the Machiavellian point of view,

15:48.280 --> 15:53.280
 you would say he was great also.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.360
 But when you think about beautiful creations

15:56.360 --> 15:59.880
 done by human beings in the space of, say,

15:59.880 --> 16:02.120
 martial arts and the space of sport,

16:03.200 --> 16:05.240
 what inspires you?

16:05.240 --> 16:06.880
 The peak of performance?

16:06.880 --> 16:10.160
 I see where you're coming from, Lex, it's a great question.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.960
 For me, it always comes down to degree of difficulty,

16:13.960 --> 16:17.320
 but things are difficult in different ways, okay?

16:17.320 --> 16:22.320
 A single flawless performance in youth

16:22.720 --> 16:25.240
 is still a, that wins a gold medal.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.360
 Let's say, for example,

16:27.440 --> 16:31.240
 Nadia Cominici won the Olympic gold medal in gymnastics,

16:31.240 --> 16:34.160
 the first person ever to get a perfect score.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.440
 If she had disappeared after that,

16:36.440 --> 16:39.120
 we would still remember that as an incredible moment.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.320
 And the degree of difficulty to get a perfect score

16:42.320 --> 16:46.000
 in Olympic gymnastics is just off the charts.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.280
 And contrast that with someone who went to four Olympics

16:50.280 --> 16:52.080
 and got four silver medals.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.960
 I mean, they're both incredible achievements.

16:53.960 --> 16:54.920
 They're just different.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.400
 The attributes that lead to longevity

16:59.400 --> 17:01.800
 typically tend to conflict with the attributes

17:01.800 --> 17:05.280
 that bring a powerful single performance.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.600
 One is all about focus on a particular event.

17:08.600 --> 17:13.600
 The other is on spreading your resources over time.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.040
 Both of them present tremendous difficulties.

17:17.080 --> 17:19.400
 There's no need to say one is better than the other.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.640
 There's also just, for me personally,

17:21.640 --> 17:26.640
 the stories of somebody who truly struggled

17:26.640 --> 17:29.040
 are the most powerful.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.360
 I know a bunch of people don't necessarily agree

17:31.360 --> 17:33.560
 because you said perfection.

17:33.560 --> 17:37.080
 Perfection is kind of the antithesis of struggle.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.440
 But I look at somebody, okay, my own life,

17:39.440 --> 17:42.800
 somebody I'm a fan of, I'm a huge fan of yours.

17:42.800 --> 17:43.960
 I'm trying not to be nervous here,

17:43.960 --> 17:47.040
 but somebody I'm a fan of in the judo world

17:47.040 --> 17:49.000
 is Travis Stevens.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.960
 He's a remarkable fellow, by the way.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.440
 A remarkable human being.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.840
 Insane in the best kinds of ways.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.960
 I think I started judo, I really started martial arts.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.920
 I have wrestled if you consider those martial arts.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.720
 That's been in my blood, I'm Russian so.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.840
 But beyond that, the whole pajama thing we wear,

18:07.840 --> 18:12.680
 the gi, I started by watching Travis in 2008 Olympics.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.280
 Was that accidental, or did you know Travis

18:15.280 --> 18:16.120
 prior to watching him?

18:16.120 --> 18:16.960
 No, no, no.

18:16.960 --> 18:17.800
 I just tuned in.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.360
 Now, that's an unusual choice.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.200
 It was just random.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.280
 You just tuned in and you saw Travis Stevens.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.800
 I tuned in to the Olympics

18:23.800 --> 18:26.160
 and I was wondering what judo is.

18:26.160 --> 18:29.000
 And then I started watching.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.680
 We're all proud of our countries and so on.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.720
 So I started watching, he was, I think,

18:34.720 --> 18:39.720
 the only American in the Olympics for judo.

18:39.720 --> 18:44.040
 Maybe the, so the Scala Harrison was 2012.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.040
 Rhonda was there too.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.360
 So I watched Rhonda and Travis.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.920
 But obviously sort of,

18:49.920 --> 18:53.080
 I was focused on somebody who also weighed the same as I did.

18:53.080 --> 18:57.560
 So there was a kind of, I think 81 kilograms.

18:57.560 --> 18:58.800
 So there's a connection,

18:58.800 --> 19:00.640
 but also there's an intensity to him.

19:00.640 --> 19:05.640
 Like he would get like angry at his own failures

19:06.120 --> 19:07.840
 and he would just refuse to quit.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.600
 It's that kind of Dan Gable mentality.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.120
 I just, that was inspiring to me that he's the underdog.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.120
 And the way people talk about him,

19:16.120 --> 19:19.600
 the commentators, that it was an unlikely person

19:19.600 --> 19:21.400
 to do well, right?

19:21.400 --> 19:25.400
 And I, the FU attitude behind that,

19:25.400 --> 19:27.280
 saying, no, I'm gonna still win gold.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.280
 Obviously he didn't do well in 2008,

19:29.280 --> 19:33.360
 but that was somehow inspiring.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.440
 And I just remember he pulled me in,

19:36.440 --> 19:40.800
 but then I started to see this sport, I guess you can call it,

19:42.080 --> 19:47.080
 of effortlessly dominating your opponent and like throwing.

19:48.520 --> 19:52.200
 Cause I, to me wrestling was like a grind.

19:52.200 --> 19:56.880
 You kind of control, you slowly just break your opponent.

19:56.880 --> 20:01.360
 The idea that you could with like a foot sweep

20:01.360 --> 20:06.040
 was fascinating to me that just because of timing,

20:06.040 --> 20:10.440
 you can take these like monsters, giant people,

20:10.440 --> 20:15.440
 like incredible athletes and just smash them with,

20:15.880 --> 20:18.120
 it just doesn't, there was no struggle to it.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.920
 It was always like a look of surprise.

20:19.920 --> 20:23.520
 Judo dominance in Judo has a look at,

20:23.520 --> 20:26.240
 like the other person is like, what just happened?

20:26.240 --> 20:27.080
 Yes.

20:27.080 --> 20:28.520
 This is very different from wrestling.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.600
 It's built into the rule structure too.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.240
 The whole idea of an epon of a match being over in an instant.

20:34.240 --> 20:39.000
 And that creates a thrilling spectator sport.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.960
 Because you can, as you say with Ashiwaza, the foot sweeps,

20:44.360 --> 20:47.680
 you can take someone out who's heavily favored.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.400
 And if you're not, Judo was the most unforgiving

20:51.400 --> 20:53.400
 of all the grappling sports.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.360
 If you have a lapse of concentration for half a second,

20:56.360 --> 20:59.200
 it's done, it's over.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.200
 If those guys get a grip on each other,

21:01.200 --> 21:04.640
 any one of them can throw the other.

21:08.440 --> 21:13.200
 When you see someone like Nomura who won three

21:13.200 --> 21:17.520
 Olympic gold medals to win across three Olympics,

21:17.520 --> 21:19.480
 and that's an incredible achievement,

21:19.480 --> 21:21.520
 given how many ways there are to lose

21:21.520 --> 21:22.880
 in the standing position in Judo

21:22.880 --> 21:25.640
 and how unforgiving it is as a sport,

21:25.640 --> 21:28.680
 it shows an incredible level of dominance.

21:28.680 --> 21:32.720
 And I think when I was also introduced at that time

21:33.920 --> 21:36.400
 to the idea of Jessica in Judo,

21:36.400 --> 21:38.960
 I think in Jiu Jitsu is the same.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.640
 A lot of sports is probably the same.

21:40.640 --> 21:44.120
 Is there's ways to win that include kind of,

21:45.160 --> 21:48.080
 if I were to use a bad term, stalling.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.280
 Which is like use strategy to slow down,

21:51.280 --> 21:53.600
 to destroy all the weapons your opponent has

21:53.600 --> 21:55.240
 and just to wait it out.

21:55.240 --> 21:59.280
 To sort of break your opponent by shutting down

21:59.280 --> 22:01.840
 all their weapons, but not using any of your own.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.680
 Yes.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.480
 And now Travis was always going for,

22:06.480 --> 22:08.960
 he's of course really good at gripping

22:08.960 --> 22:10.280
 and do that whole game,

22:10.280 --> 22:12.880
 but he was going for the big throws.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.520
 And he was almost getting frustrated

22:15.520 --> 22:17.680
 by a lot of the opponents.

22:17.680 --> 22:21.680
 I remember Ola Bischoff, I think.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.640
 Yes, from Germany.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.360
 Very talented. Very talented.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.360
 Very incredible.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.600
 I know he's very good at doing big throws

22:28.600 --> 22:29.840
 and he's incredible Jidoka,

22:29.840 --> 22:33.800
 but he was also incredible at just frustrating his opponents

22:33.800 --> 22:36.120
 with like gripping and strategy and so on.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.680
 And I just remember feeling the pain of this person,

22:39.680 --> 22:42.160
 like Travis who went through,

22:42.160 --> 22:44.440
 just he broke like every part of his body.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.520
 He went through so many injuries.

22:46.520 --> 22:50.080
 Just this person who dedicated his entire life

22:50.080 --> 22:55.080
 to this moment in 2008 and then 2012 and 2016,

22:55.240 --> 22:57.200
 just gave everything.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.600
 You could see it in his face

22:59.840 --> 23:04.560
 that his weapons are being shut down.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.160
 And he's still pushing forward.

23:06.160 --> 23:09.640
 He's still with that, both the frustration and the power.

23:09.640 --> 23:12.640
 I mean, the kind of throw he does

23:12.640 --> 23:15.720
 is his main one, I think, is the standing.

23:15.720 --> 23:16.920
 It was called Sayonagi.

23:16.920 --> 23:17.760
 He called Sayonagi.

23:17.760 --> 23:18.600
 He called Sayonagi.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.400
 But that was the other thing is like,

23:21.400 --> 23:25.400
 the techniques he used was these big throws

23:25.400 --> 23:28.080
 that there's something to me about the Sayonagi.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.160
 I fell in love with that throw.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.480
 That's my main throw, standing Sayonagi.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.320
 That is like...

23:35.320 --> 23:37.280
 Why do you favor the standing variation?

23:37.280 --> 23:38.480
 Because of the amplitude?

23:39.720 --> 23:41.960
 You get a more powerful windup.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.400
 Yeah, power.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.240
 It's like...

23:44.240 --> 23:45.400
 Are you a fan of Koga?

23:45.400 --> 23:50.400
 Yes, so Koga and Travis opened up my...

23:52.880 --> 23:54.640
 Travis uses the same gripping patterns

23:54.640 --> 23:55.840
 for Sayonagi as Koga.

23:55.840 --> 23:59.560
 All the same and the way he uses his hips and turns.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.960
 And I remember going to my judo club

24:01.960 --> 24:05.200
 and other judo clubs and they were all saying

24:05.200 --> 24:07.200
 this is the wrong way to do it.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.960
 The way Travis does it is the wrong way to do it.

24:08.960 --> 24:09.800
 And I remember like...

24:09.800 --> 24:10.880
 I've always been amazed by this.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.520
 By the way, I don't mean to cut you off,

24:12.520 --> 24:17.520
 but I could literally fill 20 hours of reproductions

24:19.200 --> 24:24.200
 of people who will tell me that either my students

24:24.320 --> 24:29.320
 or other great world champions are doing things wrong.

24:30.760 --> 24:35.160
 And I'm looking at them and I'm like,

24:35.160 --> 24:38.240
 who would I rather trust here in their judgment?

24:38.240 --> 24:43.240
 Koga, who was one of the greatest throwers of all time

24:44.840 --> 24:49.840
 or you, a recreational guy who couldn't throw my grandmother.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.160
 I'm supposed to take your word over his.

24:56.160 --> 25:00.040
 Well, say, don't listen to what people say.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.880
 I'm gonna give you a piece of advice here.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.880
 Watch what the best people do.

25:04.880 --> 25:09.240
 Okay, that's how you get superior athletic performance.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.160
 I'm gonna say that again.

25:11.160 --> 25:13.040
 Don't listen to what people say.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.880
 Watch what they do,

25:14.880 --> 25:17.440
 particularly under the stress of high level competition

25:17.440 --> 25:19.560
 because that's when you see their real game,

25:19.560 --> 25:22.280
 what they really do under pressure.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.200
 Okay, and if you can emulate that,

25:24.200 --> 25:26.000
 you're gonna be very successful.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.720
 I guess what I was frustrated with to your point

25:29.720 --> 25:32.760
 is that the argument against Koga

25:32.760 --> 25:36.920
 is what he has a very specific body type

25:36.920 --> 25:40.040
 and he figured out something that worked for him.

25:40.040 --> 25:45.040
 Thus, the statement is that might not be applicable to you

25:46.400 --> 25:49.520
 or to the general public of judo players

25:49.520 --> 25:51.280
 that wanna succeed.

25:51.280 --> 25:55.760
 That, by the way, at the shallow level might be true.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.280
 Might be true.

25:57.280 --> 26:00.280
 The point is there might be a body of knowledge

26:00.280 --> 26:03.080
 that's yet to be discovered and explored

26:03.080 --> 26:05.480
 that Koga opened up.

26:05.480 --> 26:10.200
 That I wanted to understand why his technique worked.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.680
 It made no sense to me that with a single foot,

26:12.680 --> 26:14.440
 like the way you turn the hip,

26:14.440 --> 26:17.720
 the single foot that steps in, why does that work?

26:17.720 --> 26:20.720
 Because it was actually very difficult to make work.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.360
 For me as a white belt in the very beginning,

26:23.360 --> 26:24.760
 it doesn't make sense.

26:24.760 --> 26:28.280
 Like people just, they don't get loaded up onto your hip.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.000
 Anyway, for people who don't watch Koga highlights,

26:31.000 --> 26:32.920
 watch Travis Stevens highlights,

26:32.920 --> 26:36.960
 but the details of the technique don't make sense.

26:36.960 --> 26:40.400
 But when mastered, it feels like

26:40.400 --> 26:42.440
 there's something fundamental there

26:42.440 --> 26:44.160
 that hasn't been explored yet.

26:44.160 --> 26:48.600
 It's like Koga and Travis made me think

26:48.600 --> 26:53.520
 that we don't know most of the body mechanics

26:53.520 --> 26:55.880
 involved in dominance in judo.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.120
 Like we just kind of found a few pockets

26:58.120 --> 26:59.080
 that worked really well.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.400
 The Uchimara, there's these different throws,

27:01.400 --> 27:02.840
 Osoto Gari.

27:02.840 --> 27:05.200
 I wonder if there's like totally cool new things

27:05.200 --> 27:06.240
 that we haven't discovered.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.040
 And that Sayonagi gave a little peek

27:08.040 --> 27:11.000
 because there's very few people that I'm aware of

27:11.000 --> 27:13.920
 that do it the way Travis and Koga did.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.360
 May I ask you a question?

27:15.360 --> 27:16.200
 Yes.

27:17.280 --> 27:20.560
 The choice of standing Sayonagi,

27:20.560 --> 27:23.680
 I should say this for your listeners.

27:23.680 --> 27:24.680
 They probably think about the hell

27:24.680 --> 27:26.840
 these two guys talking about.

27:26.840 --> 27:30.240
 Sayonagi is one of the more high percentage throws

27:30.240 --> 27:31.640
 in the Olympic sport of judo.

27:32.720 --> 27:36.320
 Probably Uchimara is probably number one

27:36.320 --> 27:39.200
 and variations of Sayonagi would be

27:39.200 --> 27:40.680
 in the top five for sure.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.760
 The basic choice you have in modern competition

27:44.760 --> 27:47.960
 is the more difficult standing Sayonagi

27:47.960 --> 27:50.000
 where you literally are up on your feet

27:50.000 --> 27:52.360
 and you perform a shoulder throw

27:52.360 --> 27:55.720
 that takes your opponent over from a full standing position.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.280
 The most popular form of Sayonagi

27:59.280 --> 28:01.120
 in modern competition by a landslide

28:01.120 --> 28:02.440
 is not the standing version.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.520
 It's a drop Sayonagi where you go down to your knees.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.480
 This means you have a much easier time

28:08.480 --> 28:10.480
 getting underneath your opponent's center of gravity.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.520
 The defining feature of any Sayonagi

28:12.520 --> 28:14.800
 is getting underneath your opponent's center of gravity

28:14.800 --> 28:15.640
 and lifting them.

28:15.640 --> 28:18.480
 Sayoi literally means to lift and carry.

28:18.480 --> 28:23.560
 Why did you choose the more difficult version?

28:23.560 --> 28:24.760
 What was your motivation?

28:24.760 --> 28:26.920
 You know you're a smart kid.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.720
 You know right from the start

28:28.720 --> 28:30.320
 that for every standing Sayonagi

28:30.320 --> 28:32.640
 there's 20 drop Sayonagi in modern competition.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.880
 One is obviously more high percentage.

28:34.880 --> 28:39.360
 One obviously works for a wider variety of body types.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.320
 The number of people who are successful

28:41.320 --> 28:44.080
 with standing Sayonagi is dramatically lower

28:44.080 --> 28:47.640
 and it appears to be a move which is completely absent

28:47.640 --> 28:49.960
 in the heavyweight divisions

28:49.960 --> 28:53.360
 and rarely seen in the lightweight divisions.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.480
 Why?

28:55.480 --> 28:56.880
 What was the motivation?

28:56.880 --> 29:01.000
 Why did you willingly adopt the less high percentage over?

29:01.000 --> 29:02.480
 That's to be very interesting.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.840
 The more high percentage.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.480
 I would love you to break it apart

29:06.480 --> 29:09.280
 because I apply the same kind of thinking

29:09.280 --> 29:10.360
 to basically everything.

29:10.360 --> 29:11.440
 I mentioned you offline.

29:11.440 --> 29:14.920
 There's these Boston Dynamics spot robots.

29:14.920 --> 29:18.120
 When I first met Spot, I fell in love.

29:18.120 --> 29:20.600
 I don't understand what exactly

29:20.600 --> 29:22.680
 but there's magic there

29:22.680 --> 29:24.560
 and I just got excited by it

29:24.560 --> 29:26.440
 and that fire burns.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.640
 I wanna work with these robots.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.640
 I wanna work with the robots.

29:29.640 --> 29:33.560
 I want to, I felt like there's something special there

29:33.560 --> 29:36.480
 that I could build something interesting with,

29:36.480 --> 29:38.000
 create something interesting with

29:38.000 --> 29:41.240
 and the same with standing Sayonagi

29:41.240 --> 29:43.040
 from Koga and Travis.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.760
 I just fell in love with that technique

29:44.760 --> 29:45.600
 just even watching.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.800
 I didn't even know what the hell to do with it.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.120
 What's an aesthetic?

29:49.120 --> 29:51.960
 It's the standing Sayonagi is more beautiful in execution.

29:51.960 --> 29:52.800
 There's no question.

29:52.800 --> 29:56.640
 And in my own, let's,

29:56.640 --> 29:58.080
 we're talking about love here, right?

29:58.080 --> 30:01.320
 In my own definition of aesthetic, yes.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.400
 It's not just beauty

30:02.400 --> 30:04.960
 because you could argue there's more elegant sort of,

30:04.960 --> 30:07.320
 Uchimata is very beautiful and effortless.

30:07.320 --> 30:11.800
 I love something about the dominance of it.

30:11.800 --> 30:16.800
 I love the idea in sport of two people

30:17.520 --> 30:19.880
 that are the best in the world

30:19.880 --> 30:23.160
 and one of them dominating the other.

30:23.160 --> 30:26.000
 And to me, the standing Sayonagi,

30:26.000 --> 30:27.920
 you're lifted off your feet

30:27.920 --> 30:31.800
 and especially when it's done perfectly

30:32.800 --> 30:37.280
 and with really strong resistance from the other person,

30:37.280 --> 30:40.200
 it results in a big slam.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.920
 And that was like beautiful to me.

30:41.920 --> 30:45.640
 That's the Alexander Corral and like big pickups.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.760
 I love that.

30:46.760 --> 30:50.040
 It's interesting that you're correct in so far

30:50.040 --> 30:52.280
 as you're not just going with aesthetic

30:52.280 --> 30:54.880
 and the sense of beauty, but also,

30:54.880 --> 30:59.000
 but you are making as it were, value judgments.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.120
 Yes, about the throw.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.880
 And that's fascinating to me

31:04.160 --> 31:09.160
 because there's two elements to any grappling sport.

31:09.160 --> 31:12.720
 Boy, I'm always insistent upon the idea

31:12.720 --> 31:15.920
 that Jiu Jitsu is both an art and a science.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.600
 Okay, it has scientific elements

31:17.600 --> 31:20.120
 and so far as it works according to the laws of physics

31:20.120 --> 31:22.360
 and lever and fulcrum, et cetera, et cetera.

31:24.320 --> 31:28.040
 But it also has an aesthetic element

31:28.040 --> 31:31.240
 and so far as you're making choices with technique,

31:31.240 --> 31:33.720
 you're expressing who you are as a person.

31:33.720 --> 31:36.520
 You have 10,000 different variations

31:36.520 --> 31:37.760
 of moves you could use,

31:37.760 --> 31:39.840
 but you're specifically choosing these.

31:39.840 --> 31:42.000
 That's an element of choice and self expression

31:42.000 --> 31:42.840
 on your part.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.240
 And in so far as that is true,

31:44.240 --> 31:45.960
 combat sports are not just a science,

31:45.960 --> 31:47.400
 but they're also an art.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.880
 So most combat sports have this sense

31:49.880 --> 31:53.200
 which they have the features of both an art and a science.

31:53.200 --> 31:58.200
 And it's not just about high percentage in your case.

31:59.600 --> 32:02.280
 I mean, me personally, I'm obsessed with percentages.

32:02.280 --> 32:03.600
 What are the ways to make you win?

32:03.600 --> 32:04.440
 That's the science part.

32:04.440 --> 32:08.160
 Yeah, but that's also choices involved.

32:08.160 --> 32:13.160
 But there is an undeniably aesthetic element

32:14.560 --> 32:18.960
 to martial arts where you, as it were, express

32:18.960 --> 32:20.560
 who you are as a person.

32:20.560 --> 32:23.280
 In terms of the techniques you're ultimately going to choose.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.760
 Does that get in the way?

32:24.760 --> 32:26.720
 Do you allow yourself to enjoy

32:26.720 --> 32:28.640
 the aesthetic beauty of a technique?

32:28.640 --> 32:30.080
 Of course, yeah.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.960
 When martial arts are done well,

32:32.960 --> 32:35.480
 it's the most beautiful sport in the world.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.360
 When it's done poorly, it's the ugliest.

32:37.360 --> 32:42.360
 But a beautifully applied submission hold

32:42.880 --> 32:47.320
 a perfect throw, a superbly set up takedown

32:47.320 --> 32:50.480
 are among the most difficult techniques

32:50.480 --> 32:51.880
 to execute in all of sports.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.880
 And when they're done well, they're magic to observe.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.480
 But do you prefer certain techniques over others

32:57.480 --> 33:00.880
 because of their, like for example, I'll tell you,

33:00.880 --> 33:04.760
 for me, jokes of all sorts with the gi without the gi,

33:04.760 --> 33:09.760
 probably with the gi is the most beautiful to me personally.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.080
 I value them above all others.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.680
 People mostly associate myself and my students

33:16.680 --> 33:17.640
 with leg locking.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.320
 They're usually rather surprised to learn

33:19.320 --> 33:23.040
 that I actually value strangleholds far above leg locks.

33:25.080 --> 33:28.520
 But not for aesthetic reasons, for effectiveness.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.640
 We can talk about that later if you wish.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.080
 Well, let's step back.

33:33.320 --> 33:35.560
 Sorry, we drifted awfully far off topic then.

33:35.560 --> 33:37.760
 This is, I think this is beautiful.

33:38.880 --> 33:43.320
 We drifted along the river of life and martial arts.

33:43.320 --> 33:46.280
 Can you explain the fundamentals of Jiu Jitsu?

33:46.280 --> 33:48.960
 Yes, if I couldn't, I wouldn't be much of a coach.

33:51.440 --> 33:55.240
 Jiu Jitsu is an art and science

33:55.240 --> 34:00.240
 which looks to use a combination of tactical

34:00.880 --> 34:05.760
 and mechanical advantage to focus a very high percentage

34:05.760 --> 34:09.440
 of my strength against a very low percentage

34:09.440 --> 34:13.760
 of my opponent's strength at a critical point on their body,

34:13.760 --> 34:16.000
 such that if I were to exert my strength

34:16.000 --> 34:18.600
 upon that critical point, they could no longer continue

34:18.600 --> 34:19.440
 to fight.

34:19.440 --> 34:24.440
 Well, that's about weapons and defenses,

34:27.560 --> 34:30.920
 but then is there something more to be said

34:30.920 --> 34:34.000
 about the set of tools that we're talking about?

34:34.000 --> 34:35.280
 That's where the art comes in,

34:35.280 --> 34:38.040
 because ultimately you have a set of choices

34:38.040 --> 34:40.440
 and those choices that you make will be an act

34:40.440 --> 34:42.280
 of self expression on your part.

34:42.280 --> 34:46.120
 Some will prefer this, some will prefer that.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.360
 That's where you come in as an individual.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.320
 That's an overall definition of Jiu Jitsu,

34:52.080 --> 34:53.600
 of being a set of choices

34:55.480 --> 35:00.480
 that where you're using the things you're powerful in

35:01.640 --> 35:04.560
 versus the things your opponent is weakened.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.720
 No, I was only talking about percentages of body strength.

35:07.720 --> 35:12.040
 If I have, for example, let's say we have two athletes,

35:12.040 --> 35:13.920
 athlete A and athlete B.

35:13.920 --> 35:17.000
 Athlete A has 100 units of strength,

35:17.000 --> 35:18.960
 however, we define that overall.

35:18.960 --> 35:22.720
 Athlete B has 50, so ostensibly,

35:22.720 --> 35:25.440
 athlete A is twice as strong as athlete B.

35:26.400 --> 35:29.440
 But athlete B can maneuver his body

35:29.440 --> 35:34.440
 into a set of positions focused around a critical point

35:34.440 --> 35:38.200
 of his opponent's body, where he can apply 40 units

35:38.200 --> 35:41.200
 of strength out of his total of 50.

35:41.200 --> 35:44.840
 His opponent can only defend with 20 units of strength

35:44.840 --> 35:47.040
 out of his total of 100.

35:47.040 --> 35:51.760
 You have now completely reversed the strength discrepancy.

35:51.760 --> 35:54.720
 Originally, athlete A was twice as strong as B.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.920
 Now, on that one localized point,

35:56.920 --> 35:59.160
 the knee, the elbow, the neck,

35:59.160 --> 36:01.120
 B is now twice as strong as A.

36:01.120 --> 36:03.640
 Under those circumstances, B should win.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.600
 I guess what I'm trying to get at,

36:07.600 --> 36:09.640
 by the way, that's really beautifully said,

36:10.520 --> 36:13.320
 is what you just said could be applied

36:13.320 --> 36:16.960
 to other games, other battles.

36:16.960 --> 36:19.120
 It could be applied to the game of chess.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.440
 It could be applied to war, most obviously in war.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.400
 I think about, for example,

36:25.640 --> 36:28.440
 the American strategic bombing campaign in World War II.

36:30.120 --> 36:32.240
 The Eighth Army Air Force was tasked

36:32.240 --> 36:34.560
 with the idea of destroying German industry.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.400
 Did they attack all of German industry?

36:39.400 --> 36:42.000
 Of course not, that would be stupid.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.640
 They attacked the ball bearing industry, why?

36:46.640 --> 36:51.040
 Because almost all of modern machines

36:51.040 --> 36:54.800
 require ball bearings in order to operate.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.640
 In order for the mechanical interfaces

36:56.640 --> 36:58.640
 of machines to operate, you have to reduce friction.

36:58.640 --> 37:01.000
 It's done through ball bearings.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.040
 If you knocked out one tiny component

37:05.000 --> 37:07.560
 of German industry, the ball bearing industry,

37:07.560 --> 37:09.960
 the rest of it couldn't operate.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.560
 So too with the human body.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.280
 I didn't have to fight your whole body.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.760
 I just have to fight your left knee.

37:15.760 --> 37:16.960
 If I can break your left knee,

37:16.960 --> 37:19.640
 the rest of your body is irrelevant to me.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.680
 But then isn't the art of Jiu Jitsu

37:22.680 --> 37:26.960
 discovering the left knee,

37:26.960 --> 37:30.000
 the discovering the weak points?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.880
 Yeah, a huge part of Jiu Jitsu

37:31.880 --> 37:33.880
 is understanding the strengths and weaknesses

37:33.880 --> 37:35.200
 of human body.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.760
 These parts of the human body that are shockingly robust,

37:38.760 --> 37:41.480
 and there are other parts that are shockingly vulnerable.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.080
 The major joints, and of course,

37:43.080 --> 37:46.560
 the most vulnerable of all, the unprotected neck.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.680
 So if we take something I'm not familiar with,

37:49.680 --> 37:52.920
 but I was incredibly impressed by is the body lock

37:52.920 --> 37:54.000
 that I saw.

37:56.280 --> 37:57.400
 Nic Rodriguez.

37:57.400 --> 38:01.000
 Nic Rodriguez used last time a few weeks ago.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.800
 But then I also got to hang out with Craig Jones,

38:03.800 --> 38:04.800
 who showed that.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.600
 Also has a very good body lock.

38:06.600 --> 38:10.600
 So that was, I don't know if this body lock applies

38:10.600 --> 38:13.880
 to all positions, but I was seeing it from

38:13.880 --> 38:18.880
 when Craig is on top of your opponent

38:19.400 --> 38:22.280
 and trying to pass in the guard,

38:22.280 --> 38:24.840
 use the body lock as a controlling position.

38:24.840 --> 38:28.520
 The principle behind it is that it shuts down,

38:28.520 --> 38:30.080
 as you've spoken about,

38:30.080 --> 38:35.080
 it shuts down the weapons of a very strong opponent.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.240
 That's absolutely correct.

38:37.240 --> 38:42.240
 In the case of guard position, what makes guard position

38:42.800 --> 38:47.240
 dangerous, what makes someone a powerful guard player

38:47.240 --> 38:49.560
 is the movement of their hips, forward and backward

38:49.560 --> 38:50.480
 and side to side.

38:52.240 --> 38:56.080
 Body locking is designed to shut down that movement

38:56.080 --> 38:57.800
 and does a very fine job of it.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.800
 You'll see all of my students excel at it.

38:59.800 --> 39:03.160
 Gordon Ryan is probably the single best body lock guard

39:03.160 --> 39:04.240
 passer I've ever seen.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.040
 Nikki Ryan is outstanding with it.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.640
 Nico Rodriguez is very good.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.120
 Craig Jones is outstanding.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.800
 All of my students use this for a very simple reason.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.280
 Understand what is the central problem

39:15.280 --> 39:17.880
 of shutting down a dangerous guard player.

39:17.880 --> 39:18.920
 It's his hips.

39:18.920 --> 39:20.400
 That's what makes him a dangerous leg locker.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.040
 You go up against a dangerous leg locker,

39:22.040 --> 39:23.800
 body lock guard pass, single best way

39:23.800 --> 39:26.560
 to shut down most of his entries.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.400
 We're all strong in leg locks.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.280
 So in our gym, you gotta control the hips

39:33.280 --> 39:34.480
 as soon as possible.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.320
 In other words, it's gonna be a very difficult thing

39:36.320 --> 39:39.200
 to avoid leg entanglements as you go to pass.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.840
 And across the board,

39:41.840 --> 39:46.360
 my students excel in body lock guard passing.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.760
 They understand what's the most dangerous feature

39:49.760 --> 39:52.280
 their opponent has, lateral movement of their hips.

39:52.280 --> 39:55.200
 What's the single best way to stop that body lock

39:55.200 --> 39:56.800
 and then work from there.

39:56.800 --> 40:01.120
 So if this asymmetry of power is fundamental to Jijitsu,

40:01.120 --> 40:02.280
 how do you discover that?

40:02.280 --> 40:05.120
 How did you discover the body lock

40:05.120 --> 40:09.240
 that as one of many methodologies

40:09.240 --> 40:11.320
 of achieving this asymmetry?

40:11.320 --> 40:12.760
 It would be an overstatement to say

40:12.760 --> 40:14.280
 we discovered the body lock.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.280
 Body lock passing has been around longer

40:16.280 --> 40:17.960
 than we've been around.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.960
 But what I would say is that in a room full

40:20.960 --> 40:22.360
 of dangerous leg lockers,

40:22.360 --> 40:25.080
 you've gotta have a way to shut down the hips.

40:25.080 --> 40:28.520
 And so once we started using body locks,

40:28.520 --> 40:32.280
 we saw that was one excellent way to get around that problem.

40:34.080 --> 40:37.320
 As with all development, it comes from trial and error.

40:37.320 --> 40:40.760
 You will often see people teach the technique

40:40.760 --> 40:44.120
 to a certain level and you see the teaching like

40:44.120 --> 40:45.800
 there's a lot of inadequacies there.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.880
 And that doesn't cover a lot of the problems

40:47.880 --> 40:49.120
 that we're encountering.

40:49.120 --> 40:52.040
 And so trial and error is the single most important

40:52.040 --> 40:53.920
 part of the development.

40:53.920 --> 40:58.640
 Trial and error in the training room amongst ourselves.

40:58.640 --> 41:01.520
 In hard training or?

41:01.520 --> 41:03.280
 No, it never begins with hard training.

41:03.280 --> 41:07.000
 Or everything, techniques are born the same way

41:07.000 --> 41:09.840
 we're born, weak and in need of nutrition.

41:13.240 --> 41:16.880
 You have to build them up organically like children.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.840
 And you start with minimal resistance

41:18.840 --> 41:20.560
 and you make progress over time.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.640
 When you first go to the gym,

41:21.640 --> 41:23.640
 do you put 500 pounds on the bench press

41:23.640 --> 41:24.720
 and try to bench press it?

41:24.720 --> 41:26.000
 No, you'll be killed.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.080
 You start off with the bar, you build over time

41:29.080 --> 41:30.880
 and then one day, five years from now,

41:30.880 --> 41:33.240
 perhaps you really are lifting 500 pounds,

41:33.240 --> 41:36.080
 but only a forward attempt that on their first attempt.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.840
 And they're born like children in your mind first.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.920
 Like there's a spark of an idea.

41:43.920 --> 41:47.160
 Yeah, it's like scientific development

41:47.160 --> 41:53.800
 on a subject matter which is intrinsically simpler.

41:53.800 --> 41:58.440
 There's a sense in which naive and overly simplistic

41:58.440 --> 42:00.920
 assessments of scientific method may not

42:00.920 --> 42:02.920
 work well at advanced levels of science,

42:02.920 --> 42:04.640
 but they work damn well in the training room

42:04.640 --> 42:08.880
 with the subject matter is inherently simpler

42:08.880 --> 42:10.880
 than it is in research science.

42:10.880 --> 42:15.360
 And as a result, there'll be a spark.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.800
 You'll see something like, there's possibilities there,

42:17.800 --> 42:21.440
 okay, let's puzzle this out, let's work with this.

42:21.440 --> 42:24.040
 And you run into a lot of failures.

42:24.040 --> 42:25.680
 There's, you know, you've suddenly been,

42:25.680 --> 42:28.160
 oh man, if I put my hip this way, this works really well.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.360
 Then suddenly you just try and spiral,

42:29.360 --> 42:31.360
 you get caught in a simple omel platter.

42:31.360 --> 42:32.600
 And you're like, okay, that didn't work as well

42:32.600 --> 42:33.520
 as I thought.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.520
 And then you look to rectify things

42:35.520 --> 42:38.080
 if things go in promising research directions,

42:38.080 --> 42:38.920
 you keep them.

42:38.920 --> 42:41.040
 If not, you discard them.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.320
 Well, it's funny to say science,

42:42.320 --> 42:44.240
 it feels like more like art.

42:44.240 --> 42:47.080
 As somebody I really admire that talks

42:47.080 --> 42:49.760
 about this kind of ideas, Johnny I from Apple,

42:49.760 --> 42:52.480
 he's the lead designer, he recently left,

42:52.480 --> 42:55.360
 but he was the designer behind most of the products

42:55.360 --> 42:57.480
 we know and love from Apple.

42:57.480 --> 43:00.040
 And when you say designer, be more precise,

43:00.040 --> 43:02.640
 what exactly was he working on in Apple?

43:03.680 --> 43:05.240
 The iPhone.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.240
 Which parts of the iPhone did he work on?

43:07.240 --> 43:09.640
 Like the entirety of it.

43:09.640 --> 43:12.520
 Was he a leader of a research team

43:12.520 --> 43:14.840
 or was he the person personally responsible

43:14.840 --> 43:15.760
 for the development?

43:15.760 --> 43:18.720
 He's kind of, I would say,

43:18.720 --> 43:21.360
 very similar to your position.

43:22.280 --> 43:24.640
 He wasn't necessarily the last,

43:24.640 --> 43:27.840
 the person executing the manufacturer, right?

43:27.840 --> 43:28.680
 Yeah, of course.

43:28.680 --> 43:33.240
 But there's the, he's somebody that's very hands on.

43:33.240 --> 43:37.200
 And it's like, okay, so he worked obviously

43:37.200 --> 43:39.040
 extremely closely with Steve Jobs.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.160
 Steve Jobs has this idea,

43:41.160 --> 43:42.920
 we should have a computer that's as thin

43:42.920 --> 43:45.600
 as a sheet of paper, and then you start to play

43:45.600 --> 43:48.440
 with ideas of like, what does that actually look like?

43:48.440 --> 43:51.760
 The reason I bring it up is because he talked about,

43:51.760 --> 43:55.040
 he had these ideas that he would not tell Steve

43:55.040 --> 43:58.280
 because he talked about in the same exact language

43:58.280 --> 44:01.840
 as you're saying, is there's like a little baby

44:01.840 --> 44:04.080
 that it's very fragile.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.360
 It needs time to grow.

44:07.360 --> 44:08.200
 Absolutely.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.640
 And then Steve Jobs would often roll in.

44:10.640 --> 44:11.600
 Was too ruthless?

44:11.600 --> 44:13.360
 He was too ruthless.

44:13.360 --> 44:17.720
 He would destroy ideas because Johnny Yive

44:17.720 --> 44:21.160
 and the team didn't have actually good responses

44:21.160 --> 44:24.640
 to the criticism at first, because when they're babies,

44:24.640 --> 44:29.560
 you can't defend the baby, but you need a time to develop.

44:29.560 --> 44:30.840
 You need to sleep on it.

44:30.840 --> 44:33.200
 You need to rethink it, to dream things

44:33.200 --> 44:35.000
 and all those kinds of things.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.400
 It's fascinating, you say this, Lex,

44:36.400 --> 44:39.720
 because this is actually the entire history

44:39.720 --> 44:43.680
 of scientific development is literally the story

44:43.680 --> 44:47.480
 of the juxtaposition between the need to protect

44:47.480 --> 44:50.920
 and nurture new theories versus the need

44:50.920 --> 44:54.400
 to rigorously test them with harsh testing

44:54.400 --> 44:58.160
 that either verifies them or falsifies them.

44:58.160 --> 45:01.160
 And learning to find a satisfactory compromise

45:01.160 --> 45:04.200
 between those two is a very, very difficult thing.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.680
 When you look at the history of science,

45:06.680 --> 45:10.600
 you will see that there's some pretty damn chaotic moments.

45:10.600 --> 45:12.960
 Any time there's major theory change

45:12.960 --> 45:17.960
 where all kinds of apparently undesirable tricks

45:21.200 --> 45:23.400
 they use to protect certain theories

45:23.400 --> 45:26.000
 with ad hoc hypotheses, et cetera, et cetera.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
 And ultimately, only time and success over time

45:34.440 --> 45:36.520
 will justify a theory.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.880
 There's usually a period where when one theory goes

45:38.880 --> 45:41.640
 into replace another, there's something of a battle

45:41.640 --> 45:44.560
 between competing groups of scientists,

45:44.560 --> 45:46.000
 some of whom advocate theory A,

45:46.000 --> 45:47.880
 some who advocate theory B.

45:47.880 --> 45:52.200
 They often use seemingly unscrupulous methods

45:52.200 --> 45:54.440
 to protect or attack another person's theory.

45:54.440 --> 45:56.040
 They dig for proofs.

45:56.040 --> 45:59.160
 And usually some period of time has to go by.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.600
 Sometimes in some cases, it simply involved older scientists

46:02.600 --> 46:07.600
 protecting an initial theory, dying off, and new scientists

46:08.280 --> 46:10.280
 just replacing them with numbers.

46:10.280 --> 46:13.880
 And this is a common, common theme.

46:13.880 --> 46:16.120
 And the same applies in jiu jitsu.

46:16.120 --> 46:19.400
 I've so many times, especially when I first started working

46:19.400 --> 46:23.920
 with leg locks, I would show things I had worked on

46:23.920 --> 46:28.680
 to even world champion black belts,

46:28.680 --> 46:31.640
 and they would try it once or twice and fail.

46:31.640 --> 46:33.920
 It'd be like, ah, it doesn't work.

46:33.920 --> 46:37.760
 I'd be like, you tried it once on another guy

46:37.760 --> 46:39.040
 who's also a world champion,

46:39.040 --> 46:42.440
 who has a strong ability to resist it.

46:42.440 --> 46:45.480
 And that said, no more, it doesn't work.

46:45.480 --> 46:49.000
 And then five years later, they would see my students

46:50.200 --> 46:52.040
 finishing world champions with it.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.440
 And in some cases, finishing the very people

46:54.440 --> 46:57.760
 who said that the technique would never work.

46:57.760 --> 47:01.240
 I mean, if there was ever a refutation of a statement

47:01.240 --> 47:02.880
 that's a pretty clear example.

47:05.040 --> 47:09.240
 And there has to be a sense in which you can't be too

47:09.240 --> 47:11.880
 forgiving, you have to test hypotheses.

47:11.880 --> 47:14.080
 But on the other hand, you can't be too ruthless either.

47:14.080 --> 47:19.080
 You have to look for promise and my advice is start slow.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.960
 Like again, the analogy of lifting weights,

47:23.960 --> 47:25.880
 you don't lift the heaviest weights on your first day,

47:25.880 --> 47:28.860
 you build up, you work progressively over time.

47:28.860 --> 47:32.700
 Now, you also have to have some common sense here.

47:32.700 --> 47:35.180
 You can't be too forgiving to a technique

47:35.180 --> 47:38.940
 if it's repeatedly failing and good people have tried it

47:38.940 --> 47:40.740
 and multiple good people have tried it

47:40.740 --> 47:41.860
 and it's just not working out.

47:41.860 --> 47:44.220
 Then, okay, it's time to dismiss it,

47:44.220 --> 47:46.380
 but don't be too quick, you know?

47:46.380 --> 47:50.860
 Is this where your idea of training with lower belts

47:50.860 --> 47:52.620
 quite a bit comes from?

47:52.620 --> 47:54.260
 I've actually just as a side comment

47:54.260 --> 47:55.980
 and maybe you can elaborate.

47:55.980 --> 48:00.940
 I, the place, the gym balance studios

48:00.940 --> 48:03.580
 with Phil and Rick McGlary's where I got my black belt

48:03.580 --> 48:06.660
 where I grew up as a Jiu Jitsu person in Philadelphia,

48:06.660 --> 48:08.700
 they have a huge number of black belts,

48:08.700 --> 48:12.000
 but they have a huge number of all other ranks.

48:13.080 --> 48:16.140
 And the way they picked sparring partners,

48:16.140 --> 48:18.900
 people you train with is very ad hoc, it's very loose.

48:18.900 --> 48:21.020
 It's very one of those places,

48:21.020 --> 48:23.420
 one of those gyms where you can just kinda,

48:23.420 --> 48:25.940
 you can train for like three, four hours

48:25.940 --> 48:29.540
 and you can take a break or you can jump back in.

48:29.540 --> 48:30.540
 Very informal, yeah.

48:30.540 --> 48:32.660
 And you can go to war with black belts,

48:32.660 --> 48:34.820
 but then you can also play around

48:34.820 --> 48:36.580
 with the purple and the blue belts and so on.

48:36.580 --> 48:37.420
 Excellent.

48:37.420 --> 48:39.420
 And that was really beneficial for growth

48:39.420 --> 48:42.060
 and you can pick which,

48:42.060 --> 48:43.140
 because everybody has a style

48:43.140 --> 48:45.820
 and you can pick which style you really wanna work on, right?

48:45.820 --> 48:50.820
 And then I came to Boston, Broadway Jiu Jitsu

48:51.700 --> 48:54.500
 with John Clark, who I love, he's a good friend,

48:54.500 --> 48:58.180
 but it's a little bit more formal

48:58.180 --> 49:00.980
 and I found myself, it's a very interesting journey.

49:00.980 --> 49:03.860
 I would be training with black belts the whole time.

49:03.860 --> 49:07.940
 And it was a very different experience.

49:07.940 --> 49:10.620
 I found myself exploring much less.

49:10.620 --> 49:13.980
 I found myself learning much less.

49:13.980 --> 49:16.260
 I mean, part of that is on me,

49:16.260 --> 49:20.220
 but part of it was also realizing that,

49:20.220 --> 49:23.460
 wow, there's a value to training with people

49:23.460 --> 49:24.940
 that are much worse than you.

49:24.940 --> 49:28.420
 Yes, is there a philosophy you could speak to on that?

49:28.420 --> 49:30.860
 Yeah, you probably know it already.

49:31.660 --> 49:34.340
 You know from your studies in artificial intelligence

49:34.340 --> 49:37.580
 that all human beings are naturally risk averse.

49:37.580 --> 49:42.580
 This is a bias which is deeply seated in all of us.

49:42.580 --> 49:45.380
 I'm sure you're well read on people like Tversky

49:45.380 --> 49:48.980
 and et cetera who talk about this all the time.

49:48.980 --> 49:52.460
 For your viewers, there are numerous psychological

49:52.460 --> 49:55.660
 experiments that are showing that most people,

49:55.660 --> 49:59.820
 to the point of irrationality, fear loss more

49:59.820 --> 50:04.780
 than they are excited at the prospect of an equivalent gain.

50:04.780 --> 50:08.180
 So for example, if you have $100 in your wallet,

50:08.180 --> 50:11.540
 you're more worried about the idea of losing the $100

50:11.540 --> 50:13.980
 that you have now than you would be excited

50:13.980 --> 50:16.340
 by the prospect of gaining $100

50:16.340 --> 50:18.660
 that I could potentially offer you.

50:18.660 --> 50:23.660
 This comes out whenever you get black belt

50:24.660 --> 50:26.300
 versus black belt confrontations

50:26.300 --> 50:30.260
 or any kind of similar skill level.

50:30.260 --> 50:32.300
 Whenever you get similar skill levels,

50:34.060 --> 50:37.700
 the chances of defeat get very, very high.

50:37.700 --> 50:39.500
 Interestingly, if you're a white belt

50:39.500 --> 50:40.500
 and you're going against a black belt,

50:40.500 --> 50:42.340
 you'll take risks, why?

50:42.340 --> 50:44.020
 Because there's no shame in losing to a black belt

50:44.020 --> 50:44.860
 when you're a white belt.

50:44.860 --> 50:46.820
 So you'll play more lightheartedly

50:46.820 --> 50:49.180
 and you'll have a more fun role.

50:49.180 --> 50:52.780
 But when you have very similar skill levels,

50:52.780 --> 50:54.820
 you're gonna come back to what?

50:54.820 --> 50:58.860
 The techniques that are most likely to get you a win.

51:00.500 --> 51:03.900
 That number of techniques is usually pretty small.

51:03.900 --> 51:06.460
 And if you're always battling

51:06.460 --> 51:09.620
 with the same tough opponents every day,

51:09.620 --> 51:11.860
 where if you make even a single error,

51:11.860 --> 51:14.580
 it will cost you that match inspiring

51:14.580 --> 51:18.540
 and you don't like losing, you're going to stay

51:18.540 --> 51:21.580
 with a very small set of moves.

51:21.580 --> 51:24.740
 You might get slightly better at their execution over time,

51:24.740 --> 51:27.540
 but you as an individual will not grow.

51:27.540 --> 51:31.580
 Growth, as it does in organic life forms,

51:32.740 --> 51:37.660
 comes from small beginnings and builds over time.

51:37.660 --> 51:41.220
 You can't take an untested, untried move

51:41.220 --> 51:43.420
 and get it on a world champion black belt.

51:43.420 --> 51:44.460
 It's gonna get crushed.

51:44.460 --> 51:45.780
 So it's not ready for that.

51:45.780 --> 51:48.540
 It's like a lion cub being thrown out

51:48.540 --> 51:50.580
 into the Serengeti Plains.

51:50.580 --> 51:53.860
 A lion cub is just too small and too ineffective.

51:53.860 --> 51:56.380
 It's a lion, but it's a cub.

51:56.380 --> 51:58.060
 And it's not until it grows into maturity

51:58.060 --> 51:58.900
 that it can be a lion

51:58.900 --> 52:00.820
 that can dominate the Serengeti Plains.

52:03.940 --> 52:06.140
 That's why I always encourage my students

52:06.140 --> 52:08.620
 to play with a variety of belt types

52:08.620 --> 52:13.700
 and spend the majority of their time

52:13.700 --> 52:16.780
 with lesser belts for development purposes.

52:16.780 --> 52:18.540
 When you're getting closer to a competition,

52:18.540 --> 52:19.940
 you obviously want to change that.

52:19.940 --> 52:22.900
 You want to be getting more a competitive sense

52:22.900 --> 52:27.060
 of hard work, but you must learn to divide up

52:27.060 --> 52:31.860
 your training cycles into non competition cycles

52:31.860 --> 52:35.180
 where you're presumably working with people

52:35.180 --> 52:37.220
 who are slightly lower in level in yourself.

52:37.220 --> 52:40.300
 And in some cases, quite a bit lower than yourself.

52:40.300 --> 52:43.060
 And then competition cycles

52:43.060 --> 52:43.980
 where you're working with people

52:43.980 --> 52:45.780
 much closer to your own skill level.

52:46.780 --> 52:48.220
 Is there something to be said

52:48.220 --> 52:50.060
 about the flip side of that,

52:50.060 --> 52:53.500
 which is when you're training with people

52:53.500 --> 52:57.460
 at the same skill level, being okay losing to them?

52:57.460 --> 53:00.940
 Yes, you have to see training for what it is.

53:00.940 --> 53:03.100
 Training is about skill development,

53:03.100 --> 53:04.740
 not about winning or losing.

53:04.740 --> 53:08.980
 You've got to understand that you don't need

53:08.980 --> 53:10.740
 to win every battle.

53:10.740 --> 53:13.540
 You only need to win the battles that count.

53:13.540 --> 53:15.060
 And the battles that count

53:15.060 --> 53:17.380
 are in the world championship finals, okay?

53:17.380 --> 53:18.820
 That's the one that counts.

53:18.820 --> 53:21.140
 Think about that win, okay?

53:21.140 --> 53:22.860
 That's the one you're going to be remembered for.

53:22.860 --> 53:23.940
 You're not going to be remembered

53:23.940 --> 53:25.980
 for the battle you lost on Tuesday afternoon

53:25.980 --> 53:27.780
 at 3 p.m. in some nameless gym

53:27.780 --> 53:29.820
 with some guy that no one cares about.

53:29.820 --> 53:31.340
 No one's going to remember that.

53:31.340 --> 53:33.580
 You're going to be remembered for your peak performances,

53:33.580 --> 53:35.460
 not your everyday performances.

53:35.460 --> 53:38.660
 Focus your everyday performances on skill development

53:38.660 --> 53:41.460
 so that your peak performances, you can focus on winning.

53:43.940 --> 53:45.420
 This is not a therapy session,

53:45.420 --> 53:48.740
 but if I could just speak.

53:48.740 --> 53:50.580
 Every session is a therapy session.

53:51.900 --> 53:56.620
 There is still an ape thing in there.

53:56.620 --> 53:58.420
 Of course, you think I don't feel it?

53:59.540 --> 54:02.140
 You think everyone in the room doesn't feel it?

54:02.140 --> 54:05.220
 Because, for example, you haven't never seen me roll.

54:08.580 --> 54:12.580
 I've seen the look in people's eyes when they see me train

54:12.580 --> 54:16.100
 and I could see maybe it's me projecting,

54:16.100 --> 54:18.860
 but they think I thought you were supposed to be good.

54:18.860 --> 54:21.780
 I thought you were supposed to be a black belt.

54:21.780 --> 54:24.260
 Like that look, they're like studying.

54:24.260 --> 54:25.820
 I'm going to give you some therapy.

54:25.820 --> 54:26.660
 Okay.

54:26.660 --> 54:27.500
 Okay.

54:27.500 --> 54:32.500
 Do you know how many people have come up to me

54:33.460 --> 54:37.740
 over the years who have visited the training halls

54:37.740 --> 54:39.940
 that I work in and they come up to me and they go,

54:39.940 --> 54:43.820
 man, I rolled with Gary Tonan.

54:43.820 --> 54:48.500
 I did really well with him, like really well.

54:48.500 --> 54:51.020
 I'm like, oh, that's very, very good, very impressive.

54:52.340 --> 54:54.300
 And then I see them talking to their friends and I'm like,

54:54.300 --> 54:59.300
 man, I tapped out Gary Tonan and I'm sitting there going,

55:03.340 --> 55:05.940
 yeah, and you can see that they're just like,

55:05.940 --> 55:09.980
 wow, dude, I'm way better than I thought I was.

55:09.980 --> 55:13.020
 Gary Tonan, all of my students,

55:14.660 --> 55:19.180
 I pushed them in the direction of giving up bad positions

55:19.180 --> 55:20.540
 so that they practice working,

55:20.540 --> 55:22.060
 getting out of critical situations.

55:22.060 --> 55:24.180
 It's a huge part of our training program,

55:24.180 --> 55:25.940
 but Gary Tonan takes that to a level

55:25.940 --> 55:28.300
 where there's just no one else even gets close.

55:28.300 --> 55:30.380
 It's just amazing.

55:30.380 --> 55:34.420
 Like he will put himself in impossible situations

55:34.420 --> 55:38.380
 where it's a fully locked strangle,

55:38.380 --> 55:41.300
 100% on with both his arms behind his back

55:42.220 --> 55:44.780
 and he'll try to work out from there.

55:44.780 --> 55:48.540
 And seven times out of 10, he does,

55:48.540 --> 55:50.540
 but three times out of 10, he gets caught.

55:50.540 --> 55:55.540
 I'm a huge advocate of handicap training

55:55.860 --> 55:58.660
 where you handicap yourself to work on skills.

55:59.620 --> 56:02.340
 He's took that to heart,

56:02.340 --> 56:05.660
 to a level that few people, I believe, can match.

56:05.660 --> 56:07.500
 I just wonder what his psychology is like

56:07.500 --> 56:10.460
 because it's goes back to what we talked about four legs.

56:10.460 --> 56:13.620
 You have to understand it's skill development.

56:13.620 --> 56:15.260
 Don't take it personally.

56:16.220 --> 56:18.380
 I understand, I hear where you're coming from.

56:18.380 --> 56:20.900
 We've all got what you call the eight reflex

56:20.900 --> 56:22.700
 where we want to be dominant, okay?

56:22.700 --> 56:23.780
 We all do.

56:23.780 --> 56:25.700
 Cause there's thousands of white belts out there

56:25.700 --> 56:27.860
 that have tapped Gary Tonan

56:27.860 --> 56:30.220
 and they're walking around and they're poking online.

56:30.220 --> 56:31.860
 I tapped Gary Tonan.

56:31.860 --> 56:34.420
 Like Gary Tonan is like one of the best in the world.

56:34.420 --> 56:36.380
 So I'm one of the best in the world.

56:36.380 --> 56:40.220
 And does Gary get upset about this?

56:40.220 --> 56:41.100
 No, of course not.

56:41.100 --> 56:43.420
 Cause Gary knows that when it counts on stage,

56:43.420 --> 56:46.700
 he's going to be going 100% with a set of skills

56:46.700 --> 56:48.580
 that very few people can match.

56:49.580 --> 56:52.340
 He can go into an EBI overtime

56:52.340 --> 56:56.300
 at the 205 pound weight division against an ADCC champion

56:57.540 --> 57:00.580
 starting in a full arm lock position

57:00.580 --> 57:04.700
 and effortlessly get out with no problems in seconds

57:04.700 --> 57:08.940
 because he's been in that situation 25,000 times

57:08.940 --> 57:12.780
 with varying degrees of skill opponents.

57:12.780 --> 57:16.180
 And there's just no panic, no fear.

57:16.180 --> 57:20.300
 He's just doing what he's done so many thousands of times.

57:20.300 --> 57:24.260
 And that's a fine, fine example of a guy

57:24.260 --> 57:26.780
 who didn't give a damn what happened in the training room.

57:26.780 --> 57:29.100
 But when it counted on the stage,

57:29.100 --> 57:32.180
 in front of the cameras, it kicked in.

57:32.180 --> 57:35.380
 Yeah, he's an incredible inspiration actually.

57:35.380 --> 57:38.420
 He's a practitioner of something you've recently

57:38.420 --> 57:39.420
 talked quite a bit about,

57:39.420 --> 57:43.220
 which is the power of escaping sort of bad positions.

57:43.220 --> 57:46.340
 I think you've talked about it,

57:46.340 --> 57:47.900
 which is really interesting framing,

57:47.900 --> 57:52.900
 is escaping bad positions is one of the best ways,

57:54.140 --> 57:58.740
 if not the best way to demonstrate dominance

57:58.740 --> 58:01.340
 psychologically over your opponent,

58:01.340 --> 58:04.020
 that anything they throw at you,

58:05.180 --> 58:07.540
 like their weapons are useless against you.

58:08.700 --> 58:10.820
 There's a little bit of legs Friedman kicking through

58:10.820 --> 58:11.740
 on this question.

58:11.740 --> 58:13.980
 Your obsession with dominance is...

58:16.460 --> 58:18.060
 It's a therapy session.

58:18.060 --> 58:19.380
 It's a therapy session.

58:19.380 --> 58:22.420
 I'm coming from a wrestling perspective.

58:22.420 --> 58:23.980
 I think it's not just Lex Friedman.

58:23.980 --> 58:25.020
 I think it's Dan Gable.

58:25.020 --> 58:26.900
 I think it's dominant.

58:26.900 --> 58:28.740
 The Gary Tonan ethic,

58:29.620 --> 58:32.300
 it just goes against everything wrestling is about.

58:32.300 --> 58:35.580
 You never put yourself in a bad position.

58:35.580 --> 58:39.740
 And the fact, it's a philosophical guy,

58:39.740 --> 58:40.740
 I don't know what to do with it.

58:40.740 --> 58:45.740
 It's a total reframing of showing dominance

58:45.740 --> 58:49.060
 by escaping any bad position.

58:49.060 --> 58:49.900
 Yeah.

58:49.900 --> 58:53.580
 Let's talk about the idea of what is the value of escapes?

58:53.580 --> 58:56.820
 Why do I put this in as the first skill

58:56.820 --> 58:59.820
 that every students must master?

59:01.540 --> 59:02.380
 Believe it or not,

59:04.060 --> 59:09.060
 when I talked about how it pertains to dominance,

59:09.060 --> 59:11.420
 that's its smallest value.

59:12.340 --> 59:14.980
 Its greatest value has nothing to do with dominance.

59:14.980 --> 59:16.500
 It has to do with confidence.

59:19.300 --> 59:22.540
 You can train someone and teach them technique

59:22.540 --> 59:24.260
 until you're blue in the face.

59:25.420 --> 59:29.340
 But at some point, the athlete in question

59:29.340 --> 59:31.900
 has to go out there on the stage

59:31.900 --> 59:34.740
 and pull the trigger when the time is right.

59:34.740 --> 59:39.740
 What's going to give you that ability

59:40.260 --> 59:44.660
 to go from the physical skills that you've learned

59:44.660 --> 59:48.460
 to execution under pressure is confidence.

59:54.700 --> 59:56.860
 I always talk about skill development.

59:56.860 --> 1:00:00.020
 And yes, skill development is the absolute bedrock

1:00:00.020 --> 1:00:01.420
 of my training programs.

1:00:01.420 --> 1:00:06.420
 But you can't finish at that level.

1:00:07.740 --> 1:00:10.020
 There has to be something more than that.

1:00:10.020 --> 1:00:13.460
 And you have to go from the physical element of skill

1:00:13.460 --> 1:00:16.460
 into the psychological element of confidence.

1:00:16.460 --> 1:00:19.940
 I can teach you an armbar all day.

1:00:19.940 --> 1:00:21.140
 You can get to a point

1:00:21.140 --> 1:00:24.340
 where you can flawlessly execute armbars and drilling

1:00:24.340 --> 1:00:26.900
 and even in a certain level of competition.

1:00:26.900 --> 1:00:31.900
 But if you believe that in attempting an armbar

1:00:32.580 --> 1:00:36.340
 on a dangerous opponent with good guard passing skills,

1:00:36.340 --> 1:00:38.740
 say the armbar has been performed from guard position,

1:00:40.500 --> 1:00:45.500
 that if the armbar fails and your opponent uses that failure

1:00:45.900 --> 1:00:49.420
 to set up a strong pass and get into a side pin,

1:00:49.420 --> 1:00:51.060
 possibly into the mount,

1:00:51.060 --> 1:00:53.020
 and you don't have the ability

1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:55.820
 to get out of that side pin or mount,

1:00:55.820 --> 1:00:58.420
 you won't pull the trigger on the armbar.

1:00:58.420 --> 1:01:02.500
 And so even though you had all the requisite physical skills

1:01:02.500 --> 1:01:04.140
 to perform the technique,

1:01:04.140 --> 1:01:07.780
 when push came to shove and the critical moment came,

1:01:08.860 --> 1:01:12.020
 you back down, you didn't pull the trigger.

1:01:13.820 --> 1:01:18.820
 Building that confidence is the key to championship performance

1:01:19.900 --> 1:01:23.740
 and the single best way to do it

1:01:23.740 --> 1:01:26.380
 is to take away the innate fear

1:01:26.380 --> 1:01:29.540
 that we all have of bad outcomes

1:01:29.540 --> 1:01:33.340
 that makes us naturally risk averse.

1:01:33.340 --> 1:01:35.860
 When you don't believe you can be pinned,

1:01:35.860 --> 1:01:38.260
 when you don't believe your guard can be passed,

1:01:38.260 --> 1:01:42.660
 you'll take risks because there's no downside to your actions.

1:01:42.660 --> 1:01:46.140
 An unpinnable person and an unpassable person

1:01:46.140 --> 1:01:48.780
 doesn't have much to fear and if you did too much.

1:01:48.780 --> 1:01:51.700
 You can come out and fire with all guns blazing

1:01:51.700 --> 1:01:53.340
 because then you know at the end of the day,

1:01:53.340 --> 1:01:54.500
 no one's gonna hold you down,

1:01:54.500 --> 1:01:56.420
 no one's gonna pass your guard.

1:01:56.420 --> 1:01:58.860
 That's your first two goals in jiu jitsu.

1:01:58.860 --> 1:02:00.500
 They're the most boring goals.

1:02:00.500 --> 1:02:01.580
 They're not exciting to learn.

1:02:01.580 --> 1:02:03.580
 No one wants to come in and they're first and they're told,

1:02:03.580 --> 1:02:04.780
 okay, you're gonna practice escapes

1:02:04.780 --> 1:02:06.100
 for the next year of your life.

1:02:06.100 --> 1:02:08.260
 Okay, it's okay, are you kidding me?

1:02:08.260 --> 1:02:09.860
 But that's what you gotta have.

1:02:09.860 --> 1:02:11.380
 That's your first skill

1:02:11.380 --> 1:02:14.100
 and that's what I push upon all of my students.

1:02:14.100 --> 1:02:16.180
 You'll see almost all of them

1:02:16.180 --> 1:02:18.660
 are very, very strong in escape skills.

1:02:18.660 --> 1:02:21.060
 They know that if things go wrong,

1:02:21.060 --> 1:02:22.740
 they can always get out.

1:02:22.740 --> 1:02:24.900
 They can always live to fight another day

1:02:26.300 --> 1:02:28.340
 and that is what gives them the ability

1:02:28.340 --> 1:02:30.020
 to attack without fear.

1:02:31.420 --> 1:02:34.740
 I think that it's so profound and so rare.

1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:37.700
 It's so rare to hear this.

1:02:37.700 --> 1:02:40.500
 I think it's because it's the most painful thing to do.

1:02:41.900 --> 1:02:43.060
 Always ask yourself,

1:02:44.900 --> 1:02:46.660
 when you entered jiu jitsu match,

1:02:46.660 --> 1:02:51.380
 you already know ahead of time,

1:02:52.820 --> 1:02:55.540
 if you're going to lose, how are you going to lose?

1:02:56.700 --> 1:02:59.900
 Okay, there's only a certain number of realistic submissions

1:02:59.900 --> 1:03:01.060
 that work in the sport of jiu jitsu.

1:03:01.060 --> 1:03:03.260
 The number is very small.

1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:06.500
 So ahead of time, you already know

1:03:06.500 --> 1:03:09.820
 the most likely methods of submission loss in jiu jitsu

1:03:09.820 --> 1:03:11.900
 are gonna be things like heel hook,

1:03:11.900 --> 1:03:14.740
 renegade strangle, guillotine, et cetera, et cetera.

1:03:14.740 --> 1:03:17.500
 Just work backwards from that knowledge.

1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:20.580
 So start off learning how to defend all of those things.

1:03:20.580 --> 1:03:23.580
 You know what the major losing positions are in jiu jitsu.

1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:24.580
 Someone gets mounted on you,

1:03:24.580 --> 1:03:26.700
 rear mount, side control, neon valley,

1:03:26.700 --> 1:03:28.860
 those positions you can only lose from.

1:03:28.860 --> 1:03:30.340
 So work backwards from there,

1:03:30.340 --> 1:03:32.100
 getting out of those positions.

1:03:32.100 --> 1:03:33.860
 And that's how I always start.

1:03:33.860 --> 1:03:36.420
 I always say with my students,

1:03:36.420 --> 1:03:40.300
 I teach beginners from the ground up

1:03:40.300 --> 1:03:43.180
 and I teach experts backwards.

1:03:43.180 --> 1:03:45.300
 What does that mean?

1:03:45.300 --> 1:03:48.140
 When a young student comes to me with no skills,

1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:49.540
 they learn from the ground up.

1:03:49.540 --> 1:03:52.340
 They start on their backs, defending pins.

1:03:52.340 --> 1:03:54.260
 Then they start on their backs,

1:03:54.260 --> 1:03:55.780
 working from half guard bottom.

1:03:55.780 --> 1:03:58.500
 Then on their backs, working from variations of guard.

1:03:58.500 --> 1:04:00.380
 They don't even get the C top position

1:04:00.380 --> 1:04:02.820
 until they're strong off their backs.

1:04:02.820 --> 1:04:06.460
 Then they go onto their knees and they start passing,

1:04:07.700 --> 1:04:09.620
 start standing and passing,

1:04:09.620 --> 1:04:12.220
 and then they work their pins and transitions.

1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:14.220
 And then ultimately they stand up to their feet

1:04:14.220 --> 1:04:16.700
 and they work standing position on their feet.

1:04:16.700 --> 1:04:20.780
 So they work from ground back on the floor

1:04:20.780 --> 1:04:23.540
 to ground knees on the floor, ground standing,

1:04:23.540 --> 1:04:24.660
 and then both athletes standing.

1:04:24.660 --> 1:04:26.300
 It's a gradual progression over time

1:04:26.300 --> 1:04:28.980
 where they work from the bottom to the top.

1:04:28.980 --> 1:04:32.860
 With regards experts, I teach them end game first.

1:04:32.860 --> 1:04:34.420
 They must become very, very strong

1:04:34.420 --> 1:04:37.580
 in what finishes the match, which is submission holds.

1:04:38.900 --> 1:04:40.580
 Okay.

1:04:40.580 --> 1:04:43.980
 In chess, we always talk about end game.

1:04:43.980 --> 1:04:45.660
 I do the same thing in jiu jitsu.

1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:49.420
 I start experts just looking at the mechanics

1:04:49.420 --> 1:04:52.340
 of breaking people and all the submission holds that I teach.

1:04:52.340 --> 1:04:54.900
 You should know that I teach only a very small number

1:04:54.900 --> 1:04:57.060
 of submission holds, around six.

1:04:58.980 --> 1:05:01.780
 It's interesting that my students have by far and away

1:05:01.780 --> 1:05:04.660
 the highest submission rate in contemporary jiu jitsu,

1:05:04.660 --> 1:05:07.660
 but they only learn around six to seven submission holds.

1:05:07.660 --> 1:05:11.540
 I start them with mechanics

1:05:12.420 --> 1:05:15.140
 where they learn the end game, how to break someone.

1:05:19.860 --> 1:05:24.860
 Once they develop in their mind the belief

1:05:25.620 --> 1:05:30.140
 that if the conditional if they can get

1:05:30.140 --> 1:05:31.980
 to one of those six positions,

1:05:33.500 --> 1:05:36.540
 there's a very high likelihood they'll win.

1:05:36.540 --> 1:05:41.540
 If they truly believe then, when it's competition time,

1:05:41.860 --> 1:05:45.580
 they'll fucking find a way to get to those positions.

1:05:45.580 --> 1:05:47.140
 That's confidence.

1:05:47.140 --> 1:05:49.740
 But if you don't believe, let's say you believe,

1:05:49.740 --> 1:05:51.380
 man, if I get to a finishing position,

1:05:51.380 --> 1:05:53.140
 an armbar or a strangle,

1:05:53.140 --> 1:05:55.540
 there's only like a 20% chance I'll finish with it.

1:05:55.540 --> 1:05:58.060
 How hard are you gonna fight to get to that position?

1:05:58.060 --> 1:05:59.380
 You're not.

1:05:59.380 --> 1:06:00.620
 Why? Why would you?

1:06:01.580 --> 1:06:04.220
 If you believe there's a 98% chance

1:06:04.220 --> 1:06:06.980
 if you get to that position, you'll finish.

1:06:06.980 --> 1:06:08.460
 You'll find a way to get there.

1:06:09.460 --> 1:06:10.820
 That is so powerful.

1:06:10.820 --> 1:06:13.380
 There's certain things, maybe going back to judo

1:06:13.380 --> 1:06:16.980
 a little bit is the, there's a clock choke

1:06:16.980 --> 1:06:20.260
 for people who are listening with a gi

1:06:20.260 --> 1:06:23.980
 when a person is in a turtle position

1:06:23.980 --> 1:06:25.860
 and a crouching position.

1:06:25.860 --> 1:06:28.860
 This is something that's done in judo quite a bit.

1:06:28.860 --> 1:06:31.020
 But I have, it doesn't matter what the technique is.

1:06:31.020 --> 1:06:35.020
 I have a belief in my head that there's not a person

1:06:35.020 --> 1:06:39.020
 in the world that I can't choke with that clock choke.

1:06:39.020 --> 1:06:40.180
 That's a good belief to have.

1:06:40.180 --> 1:06:44.180
 And I've done that, and that it was a built on itself.

1:06:46.300 --> 1:06:50.780
 The belief made the technique better and better and better.

1:06:50.780 --> 1:06:52.580
 Now you're onto something.

1:06:52.580 --> 1:06:55.100
 That's exactly the mindset that I'm trying to coach.

1:06:55.100 --> 1:06:56.420
 But that's step one.

1:06:57.620 --> 1:06:59.380
 You have to believe that one...

1:06:59.380 --> 1:07:01.100
 You have to believe that...

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:02.780
 But you've got to stop somewhere.

1:07:02.780 --> 1:07:03.860
 And then... It's step one.

1:07:03.860 --> 1:07:05.060
 But then you have to create a system...

1:07:05.060 --> 1:07:06.940
 But it's a damn important step.

1:07:06.940 --> 1:07:08.980
 So you coach the end game first

1:07:08.980 --> 1:07:11.700
 and then you fill in the details afterwards.

1:07:11.700 --> 1:07:13.300
 Yeah, that's a huge confidence builder,

1:07:13.300 --> 1:07:17.940
 but I just, I have to say, to admit,

1:07:17.940 --> 1:07:19.940
 and it makes me sad, but I think I'm not alone.

1:07:19.940 --> 1:07:23.100
 I think I'm majority of Jiu Jitsu people are like this,

1:07:23.100 --> 1:07:27.900
 that I didn't do the beginner step that you talk about,

1:07:27.900 --> 1:07:30.820
 which is focusing on escapes.

1:07:30.820 --> 1:07:35.820
 I think I learned the wrong lessons from being, from losing.

1:07:35.820 --> 1:07:39.460
 I remember in a blue belt competition long ago,

1:07:39.460 --> 1:07:44.460
 one, I think it was the finals of Atlanta IBJJF tournament.

1:07:48.700 --> 1:07:53.700
 And there's a person that passed my guard and he took Mount.

1:07:53.700 --> 1:07:58.700
 And he stayed in Mount for a long time and I couldn't breathe.

1:07:58.700 --> 1:08:02.700
 And it was like one of those things where I was truly dominated.

1:08:02.700 --> 1:08:08.700
 I don't think I've been dominated in a Jiu Jitsu match quite like that before or after.

1:08:08.700 --> 1:08:11.700
 And the lesson I learned from that is I'm not gonna let,

1:08:11.700 --> 1:08:15.700
 as opposed to working on escapes,

1:08:15.700 --> 1:08:17.700
 I'm not gonna let anyone pass my guard.

1:08:17.700 --> 1:08:20.700
 Yeah, what you learned is don't take risks.

1:08:20.700 --> 1:08:23.700
 Don't take risks.

1:08:23.700 --> 1:08:26.700
 Which is ultimately what kills you.

1:08:26.700 --> 1:08:29.700
 Ultimately, if you become the best you can, you've got to take risks.

1:08:29.700 --> 1:08:32.700
 As they say, nothing risks, nothing gained.

1:08:32.700 --> 1:08:36.700
 Failure usually makes us even more risk averse than we started.

1:08:36.700 --> 1:08:40.700
 We're already mentally biased, being human beings in that direction

1:08:40.700 --> 1:08:43.700
 and failure tends to reinforce that.

1:08:43.700 --> 1:08:47.700
 I work hard in my training programs to try and,

1:08:47.700 --> 1:08:51.700
 I work hard in my training programs to try and correct that fault.

1:08:51.700 --> 1:08:55.700
 Is it still possible for a person who is a black ball

1:08:55.700 --> 1:08:58.700
 to then just go back to that beginning journey, I guess?

1:08:58.700 --> 1:09:00.700
 Of course.

1:09:00.700 --> 1:09:02.700
 Let me tell you something.

1:09:02.700 --> 1:09:05.700
 I'm probably gonna catch a lot of flak for saying this.

1:09:05.700 --> 1:09:07.700
 I have a belief.

1:09:07.700 --> 1:09:10.700
 I won't say something, I won't call it knowledge because it's not known,

1:09:10.700 --> 1:09:13.700
 but I have a fervent belief

1:09:13.700 --> 1:09:18.700
 that human beings in most skill activities,

1:09:18.700 --> 1:09:22.700
 not all skill activities, but I will say combat sports for sure,

1:09:22.700 --> 1:09:26.700
 can reinvent themselves in five year periods.

1:09:26.700 --> 1:09:33.700
 Now, you might be saying five years, what's magical about five years.

1:09:33.700 --> 1:09:38.700
 Mike Tyson was 13 years old when he was taken in by Customato.

1:09:38.700 --> 1:09:41.700
 By the age of 18,

1:09:41.700 --> 1:09:46.700
 he was beating world class boxes in the gym

1:09:46.700 --> 1:09:52.700
 and had already made a strong name for himself in international boxing.

1:09:52.700 --> 1:09:59.700
 He was already a known figure, it was five years.

1:09:59.700 --> 1:10:06.700
 Yasuhiro Yamashita, the judo player, began judo at 13.

1:10:06.700 --> 1:10:13.700
 He placed silver in the old Japan's at 17.

1:10:13.700 --> 1:10:18.700
 I could go on all day with examples of athletes

1:10:18.700 --> 1:10:23.700
 who within a five year time frame of starting a sport

1:10:23.700 --> 1:10:26.700
 were competing at world championship level.

1:10:26.700 --> 1:10:32.700
 I'm gonna give you a rough and ready definition of sport mastery.

1:10:32.700 --> 1:10:37.700
 I believe that if you can play a competitive match

1:10:37.700 --> 1:10:43.700
 against someone ranked in the top 25 in your sport,

1:10:43.700 --> 1:10:45.700
 and it's a serious international sport,

1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:49.700
 I would call you someone who's mastered that sport.

1:10:49.700 --> 1:10:51.700
 You're damn good.

1:10:51.700 --> 1:10:55.700
 If you can go with the number 25 wrestler in the world

1:10:55.700 --> 1:10:58.700
 and gives them a hard competitive match in the gym,

1:10:58.700 --> 1:11:01.700
 you may not win it, but they had a good workout.

1:11:01.700 --> 1:11:06.700
 You have shown mastery of wrestling,

1:11:06.700 --> 1:11:12.700
 or indeed any other combat sport you care to name.

1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:16.700
 There are numerous examples of people doing far better than that

1:11:16.700 --> 1:11:22.700
 in five years, winning medals at world championships

1:11:22.700 --> 1:11:25.700
 and even Olympic games in that five year period.

1:11:25.700 --> 1:11:27.700
 This is not an unrealistic goal.

1:11:27.700 --> 1:11:29.700
 There is a lot of empirical evidence to show

1:11:29.700 --> 1:11:33.700
 that people have done this in the past, a lot of it.

1:11:33.700 --> 1:11:36.700
 If you fully immerse yourself in a sport

1:11:36.700 --> 1:11:39.700
 with a well worked out, well planned training program,

1:11:39.700 --> 1:11:42.700
 there is a mountain of evidence to show that in a five year period

1:11:42.700 --> 1:11:52.700
 you can go from a complete beginner to a very, very impressive skill level

1:11:52.700 --> 1:11:53.700
 to the point where you're competitive

1:11:53.700 --> 1:11:56.700
 with some of the best people on the planet.

1:11:56.700 --> 1:11:59.700
 You can reinvent yourself in these five year periods.

1:11:59.700 --> 1:12:02.700
 What happens with most people is they get to a certain level

1:12:02.700 --> 1:12:04.700
 and they get complacent, they get lazy,

1:12:04.700 --> 1:12:07.700
 and they just keep doing the same old thing they've been doing.

1:12:07.700 --> 1:12:10.700
 But if you're diligent and you're purposeful,

1:12:10.700 --> 1:12:14.700
 five years, you can accomplish an awful lot.

1:12:14.700 --> 1:12:17.700
 And as I said, there's a mountain of evidence to show it.

1:12:17.700 --> 1:12:21.700
 By the way, as a smaller side, somebody who's mentioned Tversky

1:12:21.700 --> 1:12:23.700
 and Yamashita in the same conversation,

1:12:23.700 --> 1:12:26.700
 you're one of the most impressive people I've ever spoken to.

1:12:26.700 --> 1:12:33.700
 But as a smaller side, so if there's this complete beginner,

1:12:33.700 --> 1:12:36.700
 this is really interesting.

1:12:36.700 --> 1:12:40.700
 There is empirical evidence that you can achieve incredible things

1:12:40.700 --> 1:12:44.700
 in a shorter amount of time.

1:12:44.700 --> 1:12:47.700
 There's a complete beginner standing before you

1:12:47.700 --> 1:12:50.700
 and that beginner has fire in their eyes

1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:53.700
 and they want to achieve mastery.

1:12:53.700 --> 1:12:59.700
 Where do you place most of the credit for a journey

1:12:59.700 --> 1:13:01.700
 that does achieve mastery?

1:13:01.700 --> 1:13:04.700
 Is it the set of ideas they have in their mind?

1:13:04.700 --> 1:13:08.700
 Is it the set of drills or the way they practice?

1:13:08.700 --> 1:13:11.700
 Is it genetics and luck?

1:13:11.700 --> 1:13:14.700
 Those are all good insights.

1:13:14.700 --> 1:13:17.700
 All of those factors you've mentioned play a different role.

1:13:17.700 --> 1:13:20.700
 Let's start with luck.

1:13:20.700 --> 1:13:25.700
 We are all subject to fortune and fortune can be good

1:13:25.700 --> 1:13:27.700
 and fortune can be bad.

1:13:27.700 --> 1:13:31.700
 Life is in many ways beautiful, but life is also tragic.

1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:35.700
 And I've had students who showed enormous promise

1:13:35.700 --> 1:13:40.700
 and just tragic events occurred in their lives.

1:13:40.700 --> 1:13:45.700
 The vicissitudes of fortune can be a wonderful thing in your life

1:13:45.700 --> 1:13:47.700
 and they can be a terrible tragedy.

1:13:47.700 --> 1:13:52.700
 I've had students who died for various reasons

1:13:52.700 --> 1:13:55.700
 who could have gone on to become world champions.

1:13:55.700 --> 1:13:58.700
 I've had students who, on a much lighter note,

1:13:58.700 --> 1:14:03.700
 just fell in love and just wanted to have kids and move away.

1:14:03.700 --> 1:14:08.700
 That's a wonderful thing, but different direction.

1:14:08.700 --> 1:14:12.700
 You just never know, so luck does play some role.

1:14:12.700 --> 1:14:15.700
 Even things like where you're born,

1:14:15.700 --> 1:14:20.700
 the location of your physical location in the world

1:14:20.700 --> 1:14:23.700
 or even socioeconomic location can play a role,

1:14:23.700 --> 1:14:26.700
 which could be detrimental or favorable.

1:14:26.700 --> 1:14:28.700
 So, yeah, luck does play some role.

1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:31.700
 Thankfully, it's one of the smaller elements.

1:14:31.700 --> 1:14:35.700
 And I do believe that a truly resourceful mind

1:14:35.700 --> 1:14:40.700
 can overcome the majority of what fortune throws at us

1:14:40.700 --> 1:14:42.700
 and get through goals,

1:14:42.700 --> 1:14:46.700
 provided you're sufficiently mentally robust.

1:14:46.700 --> 1:14:51.700
 Other things you mentioned, genetics.

1:14:51.700 --> 1:14:53.700
 I do believe in certain sports.

1:14:53.700 --> 1:14:57.700
 Genetics really do play a powerful, powerful role.

1:14:57.700 --> 1:15:04.700
 For example, in any sport where power output and reaction speed,

1:15:04.700 --> 1:15:07.700
 ability to take physical damage,

1:15:07.700 --> 1:15:10.700
 then there are genetic elements which will help.

1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:15.700
 For example, I couldn't imagine a world in which,

1:15:15.700 --> 1:15:17.700
 even if I have a crippled leg,

1:15:17.700 --> 1:15:21.700
 even if I grew up in a world where my leg was normal

1:15:21.700 --> 1:15:24.700
 and I had normal legs and everything was fine with my body,

1:15:24.700 --> 1:15:29.700
 I don't believe that I could win the Olympic gold medal

1:15:29.700 --> 1:15:31.700
 in 100 meters sprinting, for example.

1:15:31.700 --> 1:15:34.700
 I just don't have enough fast twitch muscle fibers.

1:15:34.700 --> 1:15:40.700
 But the more a sport involves skill and tactics,

1:15:40.700 --> 1:15:44.700
 the less you will see genetics playing a role.

1:15:44.700 --> 1:15:48.700
 If you look at the metal podiums in Jiu Jitsu, for example,

1:15:48.700 --> 1:15:54.700
 you will see that no one body type is definitively superior to another.

1:15:54.700 --> 1:15:56.700
 You will see every variation of body type

1:15:56.700 --> 1:15:59.700
 in the metal platforms in Jiu Jitsu.

1:15:59.700 --> 1:16:03.700
 As skill and tactics become more and more important

1:16:03.700 --> 1:16:05.700
 and things like just power output over time

1:16:05.700 --> 1:16:07.700
 become less and less important,

1:16:07.700 --> 1:16:12.700
 then you will see that genetics play less and less of a role.

1:16:12.700 --> 1:16:14.700
 I'm happy to say that the sport of Jiu Jitsu,

1:16:14.700 --> 1:16:16.700
 the evidence seems pretty clear

1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:19.700
 that there's no one dominant body type in the sport of Jiu Jitsu.

1:16:19.700 --> 1:16:22.700
 Rather, there's just advantages for one type

1:16:22.700 --> 1:16:24.700
 and there's advantages for another.

1:16:24.700 --> 1:16:30.700
 You just have to learn to tailor your game to your body.

1:16:30.700 --> 1:16:32.700
 With regards to training program,

1:16:32.700 --> 1:16:36.700
 yes, I believe with all my heart and all my soul

1:16:36.700 --> 1:16:39.700
 that your training program does make a difference.

1:16:39.700 --> 1:16:41.700
 I've dedicated my life to that.

1:16:41.700 --> 1:16:44.700
 Obviously, I'm biased in this regard.

1:16:44.700 --> 1:16:47.700
 I do believe that all of the students that I taught

1:16:47.700 --> 1:16:49.700
 who became world champions would have been great athletes,

1:16:49.700 --> 1:16:51.700
 whether or not they had met me or not.

1:16:51.700 --> 1:16:53.700
 I believe that.

1:16:53.700 --> 1:16:56.700
 But I do also believe it would have taken them a lot longer

1:16:56.700 --> 1:16:59.700
 and they may not have gotten to the level that they did.

1:16:59.700 --> 1:17:01.700
 I'm sure they would have been impressive,

1:17:01.700 --> 1:17:05.700
 but I do believe that the nature of a training program

1:17:05.700 --> 1:17:07.700
 plays an enormous difference.

1:17:07.700 --> 1:17:10.700
 I don't mean to say this in an arrogant way.

1:17:10.700 --> 1:17:14.700
 I believe there's, again, a mountain of evidence to suggest

1:17:14.700 --> 1:17:17.700
 this is true because you see it in many different sports.

1:17:17.700 --> 1:17:21.700
 Let's talk, for example, about your country, Russia,

1:17:21.700 --> 1:17:25.700
 and its wrestling program.

1:17:25.700 --> 1:17:28.700
 Russia is an enormous country,

1:17:28.700 --> 1:17:32.700
 but the location where Russia's wrestling program comes from

1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:36.700
 is actually very small and the population is actually very small.

1:17:36.700 --> 1:17:39.700
 I can't verify this, but I was told once,

1:17:39.700 --> 1:17:41.700
 I can't verify this, but the number of people

1:17:41.700 --> 1:17:44.700
 who wrestle in Russia is actually significantly smaller

1:17:44.700 --> 1:17:47.700
 than the number of people who wrestle in the United States.

1:17:47.700 --> 1:17:51.700
 It's also not part of the school athletics

1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:53.700
 and it is in the United States.

1:17:53.700 --> 1:17:54.700
 That's a different point.

1:17:54.700 --> 1:17:57.700
 We'll come back to that because that's also an important point.

1:17:57.700 --> 1:17:59.700
 But if you look at the actual numbers of people there,

1:17:59.700 --> 1:18:01.700
 they're actually pretty small.

1:18:01.700 --> 1:18:04.700
 So ostensibly, if it comes down to a numbers game,

1:18:04.700 --> 1:18:06.700
 America should dominate at the Olympics

1:18:06.700 --> 1:18:07.700
 because we have more wrestlers.

1:18:07.700 --> 1:18:09.700
 Now, the story gets more complicated

1:18:09.700 --> 1:18:11.700
 because America has a different style of wrestling,

1:18:11.700 --> 1:18:14.700
 the collegiate style than the international freestyle.

1:18:14.700 --> 1:18:18.700
 That is a complicating factor.

1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:23.700
 But nonetheless, what you see there is that numbers on everything,

1:18:23.700 --> 1:18:27.700
 rather, the manner in which people are trained

1:18:27.700 --> 1:18:28.700
 clearly has an impact.

1:18:28.700 --> 1:18:32.700
 And we know very little about the,

1:18:32.700 --> 1:18:34.700
 there's very little reliable information

1:18:34.700 --> 1:18:38.700
 about the training program for wrestling in the Russian states.

1:18:38.700 --> 1:18:42.700
 But one thing is incontestable is the amount of success

1:18:42.700 --> 1:18:45.700
 that they've had in international world championship

1:18:45.700 --> 1:18:47.700
 and Olympic competition.

1:18:47.700 --> 1:18:51.700
 They are disproportionately successful,

1:18:51.700 --> 1:18:54.700
 despite their relatively small numbers.

1:18:54.700 --> 1:18:57.700
 There's nothing genetically special about them.

1:18:57.700 --> 1:19:00.700
 You can talk about performance enhancing drugs,

1:19:00.700 --> 1:19:02.700
 but those are a worldwide phenomenon.

1:19:02.700 --> 1:19:04.700
 They don't have any access to technology

1:19:04.700 --> 1:19:09.700
 that the rest of the world doesn't have.

1:19:09.700 --> 1:19:11.700
 At some point, you've got to start asking,

1:19:11.700 --> 1:19:14.700
 what are they doing differently in the training room?

1:19:14.700 --> 1:19:19.700
 And there are many other examples of similar situations.

1:19:19.700 --> 1:19:22.700
 My country, New Zealand,

1:19:22.700 --> 1:19:27.700
 has an insanely successful rugby program,

1:19:27.700 --> 1:19:29.700
 the sport of rugby,

1:19:29.700 --> 1:19:34.700
 which they have dominated for literally generations,

1:19:34.700 --> 1:19:38.700
 despite the fact that our population is very, very small

1:19:38.700 --> 1:19:39.700
 compared with the rest of the country.

1:19:39.700 --> 1:19:41.700
 And we don't excel in many other sports.

1:19:41.700 --> 1:19:45.700
 New Zealand does fairly well in sports overall,

1:19:45.700 --> 1:19:48.700
 but nothing like they do in rugby.

1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:50.700
 And you've got to ask yourself,

1:19:50.700 --> 1:19:53.700
 is there a culture there which built this up?

1:19:53.700 --> 1:19:58.700
 And the world is full of examples of seemingly small

1:19:58.700 --> 1:20:01.700
 and unpromising areas or locations

1:20:01.700 --> 1:20:06.700
 putting out disproportionately high numbers of successful athletes.

1:20:06.700 --> 1:20:11.700
 And that points to the idea that different training programs

1:20:11.700 --> 1:20:13.700
 have different success rates.

1:20:13.700 --> 1:20:17.700
 And so I truly believe with all my heart and all my soul

1:20:17.700 --> 1:20:21.700
 that how you train does make a significant difference.

1:20:21.700 --> 1:20:24.700
 I would even go further and say it makes the most difference.

1:20:24.700 --> 1:20:25.700
 Is it the only thing?

1:20:25.700 --> 1:20:26.700
 Absolutely not.

1:20:26.700 --> 1:20:27.700
 We've already talked about fortune.

1:20:27.700 --> 1:20:30.700
 We've talked about genetics.

1:20:30.700 --> 1:20:31.700
 If you want to get nasty,

1:20:31.700 --> 1:20:32.700
 you can even talk about things like

1:20:32.700 --> 1:20:33.700
 performance enhancing drugs

1:20:33.700 --> 1:20:37.700
 that obviously plays a role in modern sports.

1:20:37.700 --> 1:20:45.700
 But I do believe that the majority of what creates success

1:20:45.700 --> 1:20:49.700
 is the interaction between the athlete and the training program.

1:20:49.700 --> 1:20:51.700
 Now the training program is one thing.

1:20:51.700 --> 1:20:53.700
 I do believe that's the single most important,

1:20:53.700 --> 1:20:57.700
 but right behind it is the athlete themselves.

1:20:57.700 --> 1:21:00.700
 In my own experience,

1:21:00.700 --> 1:21:03.700
 people talk about athletes that I've trained successfully,

1:21:03.700 --> 1:21:04.700
 but they never talk about athletes

1:21:04.700 --> 1:21:07.700
 that I've trained unsuccessfully.

1:21:07.700 --> 1:21:10.700
 Always remember that for every champion a coach produces,

1:21:10.700 --> 1:21:13.700
 there's a hundred people that they coach

1:21:13.700 --> 1:21:15.700
 that no one ever heard of,

1:21:15.700 --> 1:21:19.700
 and this is completely normal.

1:21:19.700 --> 1:21:23.700
 A coach can never take the lion's share of the credit.

1:21:23.700 --> 1:21:26.700
 A coach creates possibilities,

1:21:26.700 --> 1:21:30.700
 but it's the athlete who actualizes the possibilities.

1:21:30.700 --> 1:21:32.700
 And so building that rapport

1:21:32.700 --> 1:21:36.700
 and finding the right people to excel in your training program

1:21:36.700 --> 1:21:38.700
 is also a big part of it.

1:21:38.700 --> 1:21:41.700
 What makes the difference between the successful,

1:21:41.700 --> 1:21:44.700
 your successes, and your failures as a coach?

1:21:44.700 --> 1:21:46.700
 A range of reasons.

1:21:46.700 --> 1:21:51.700
 The single most important is persistence.

1:21:51.700 --> 1:21:54.700
 People will point to all kinds of virtues amongst athletes.

1:21:54.700 --> 1:21:55.700
 This guy's the most courageous.

1:21:55.700 --> 1:21:57.700
 This guy's the strongest.

1:21:57.700 --> 1:21:59.700
 These are all virtues,

1:21:59.700 --> 1:22:04.700
 but the one indispensable virtue is persistence.

1:22:04.700 --> 1:22:06.700
 The ability just to stay in the game long enough

1:22:06.700 --> 1:22:08.700
 to get the results you seek.

1:22:08.700 --> 1:22:11.700
 But what does persistence really look like

1:22:11.700 --> 1:22:14.700
 if we can just break that apart a little bit?

1:22:14.700 --> 1:22:16.700
 This is a great question you're asking,

1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:21.700
 because most people see it as a kind of simplistic doggedness

1:22:21.700 --> 1:22:23.700
 where you just show up every day.

1:22:23.700 --> 1:22:25.700
 That's not it.

1:22:25.700 --> 1:22:29.700
 The most important form of persistence is persistence of thinking,

1:22:29.700 --> 1:22:34.700
 which looks to push you in increasingly efficient,

1:22:34.700 --> 1:22:37.700
 more and more efficient methods of training.

1:22:37.700 --> 1:22:39.700
 Famously, people talk about the idea

1:22:39.700 --> 1:22:42.700
 that the hardest work of all is hard thinking,

1:22:42.700 --> 1:22:44.700
 and they're absolutely right.

1:22:44.700 --> 1:22:48.700
 Coming into the gym and just doing the same thing for a decade

1:22:48.700 --> 1:22:50.700
 isn't going to make you better.

1:22:50.700 --> 1:22:53.700
 What's going to make you better is progressive training over time

1:22:53.700 --> 1:22:57.700
 where you identify clear goals marked out in time increments,

1:22:57.700 --> 1:23:00.700
 three months, six months, 12 months, five years,

1:23:00.700 --> 1:23:06.700
 and build those short term goals into a program of long term goals.

1:23:06.700 --> 1:23:10.700
 Making sure that the training program changes over time

1:23:10.700 --> 1:23:12.700
 so that as your skill level rises,

1:23:12.700 --> 1:23:15.700
 the challenges you face in the gym become higher and higher.

1:23:15.700 --> 1:23:17.700
 Don't kill them at the start with challenges

1:23:17.700 --> 1:23:19.700
 that are too hard for them to deal with.

1:23:19.700 --> 1:23:21.700
 They get discouraged and leave.

1:23:21.700 --> 1:23:23.700
 Build them slowly over time,

1:23:23.700 --> 1:23:25.700
 but make sure they don't just get left in a swamp

1:23:25.700 --> 1:23:27.700
 where they're just doing the same thing they were doing

1:23:27.700 --> 1:23:29.700
 three years ago and they get bored.

1:23:29.700 --> 1:23:31.700
 There's two ways you can leave in a gym.

1:23:31.700 --> 1:23:34.700
 You can leave from adversity,

1:23:34.700 --> 1:23:37.700
 it's too tough, or you can leave from boredom.

1:23:37.700 --> 1:23:40.700
 Everyone talks about the first,

1:23:40.700 --> 1:23:42.700
 no one talks about the second.

1:23:42.700 --> 1:23:46.700
 Most people, when they get to black belt, they get bored.

1:23:46.700 --> 1:23:49.700
 They know what their game is, they know what they're good at,

1:23:49.700 --> 1:23:50.700
 they know what they're not good at.

1:23:50.700 --> 1:23:53.700
 When they compete, they stick with what they're good at,

1:23:53.700 --> 1:23:56.700
 they avoid what they're not good at, and they get bored.

1:23:56.700 --> 1:23:58.700
 They reach a plateau and that's it.

1:23:58.700 --> 1:24:02.700
 My whole thing is to make sure it's not so tough at the start

1:24:02.700 --> 1:24:04.700
 that they leave because of adversity,

1:24:04.700 --> 1:24:06.700
 and then for the rest of their career,

1:24:06.700 --> 1:24:09.700
 to make sure it's not boring so they leave because of boredom.

1:24:09.700 --> 1:24:11.700
 Travis Stevens actually said something that

1:24:11.700 --> 1:24:13.700
 changed the way he's training.

1:24:13.700 --> 1:24:15.700
 He said it as a side comment,

1:24:15.700 --> 1:24:19.700
 but he said that at the end of a good training session,

1:24:19.700 --> 1:24:23.700
 your mind should be exhausted, not your body.

1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:27.700
 And I, for most of my life,

1:24:27.700 --> 1:24:30.700
 saw a good training session as where my body was exhausted.

1:24:30.700 --> 1:24:34.700
 Yes, I believe that's the case with most people.

1:24:34.700 --> 1:24:37.700
 You should come out of the training session with your mind

1:24:37.700 --> 1:24:40.700
 buzzing with ideas like possibilities for tomorrow.

1:24:40.700 --> 1:24:42.700
 And by the way, on that note,

1:24:42.700 --> 1:24:45.700
 I would go further and say that the training session doesn't

1:24:45.700 --> 1:24:47.700
 finish when your body stops moving.

1:24:47.700 --> 1:24:50.700
 It finishes when your mind stops moving

1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:52.700
 and your mind shouldn't stop moving.

1:24:52.700 --> 1:24:54.700
 After that session, there should be analysis.

1:24:54.700 --> 1:24:55.700
 What did I do well?

1:24:55.700 --> 1:24:56.700
 What did I do badly?

1:24:56.700 --> 1:24:59.700
 How could I do better with the things that I did well?

1:24:59.700 --> 1:25:03.700
 Can I ask you about something that I truly enjoy

1:25:03.700 --> 1:25:05.700
 and I think is really powerful,

1:25:05.700 --> 1:25:07.700
 but most people don't seem to believe in that,

1:25:07.700 --> 1:25:09.700
 but is drilling?

1:25:09.700 --> 1:25:11.700
 I don't know.

1:25:11.700 --> 1:25:14.700
 Maybe people are different, but I love the idea,

1:25:14.700 --> 1:25:16.700
 maybe even outside of DJS,

1:25:16.700 --> 1:25:19.700
 of doing the same thing over and over.

1:25:19.700 --> 1:25:21.700
 It's like Jiro Dreams of Sushi.

1:25:21.700 --> 1:25:27.700
 I love doing the thing that nobody wants to do

1:25:27.700 --> 1:25:29.700
 and doing it 10 times, 100 times,

1:25:29.700 --> 1:25:33.700
 1,000 times more than what nobody wants to do.

1:25:33.700 --> 1:25:36.700
 So I'm a huge fan of drilling.

1:25:36.700 --> 1:25:38.700
 Obviously, I'm not a professional athlete,

1:25:38.700 --> 1:25:41.700
 but I feel like if I actually gave myself,

1:25:41.700 --> 1:25:44.700
 if I wanted to be really good at Jiu Jitsu,

1:25:44.700 --> 1:25:47.700
 reached the level of being in the top 25

1:25:47.700 --> 1:25:51.700
 when I was much younger, really strive,

1:25:51.700 --> 1:25:56.700
 I think I could achieve it by drilling.

1:25:56.700 --> 1:25:58.700
 I had this belief untested.

1:25:58.700 --> 1:26:02.700
 Can you challenge this idea or agree with it?

1:26:02.700 --> 1:26:04.700
 First off, fascinating.

1:26:04.700 --> 1:26:07.700
 However, we're going to have to disagree.

1:26:07.700 --> 1:26:09.700
 No, no.

1:26:09.700 --> 1:26:12.700
 We're just going to have to start to understand

1:26:12.700 --> 1:26:15.700
 what are we talking about when we talk about drilling.

1:26:15.700 --> 1:26:17.700
 It's a very vague term.

1:26:17.700 --> 1:26:19.700
 Okay.

1:26:19.700 --> 1:26:22.700
 At this moment, many of your listeners

1:26:22.700 --> 1:26:24.700
 are probably having the same thought process,

1:26:24.700 --> 1:26:27.700
 which is, oh, drilling, yeah, I know what that is.

1:26:27.700 --> 1:26:30.700
 We go into the gym and we pick a move

1:26:30.700 --> 1:26:33.700
 and we practice it for a certain number of repetitions.

1:26:33.700 --> 1:26:38.700
 And if I do that, I'm going to get better at the technique.

1:26:38.700 --> 1:26:43.700
 Okay.

1:26:43.700 --> 1:26:46.700
 They're wrong.

1:26:46.700 --> 1:26:53.700
 We've got to have a much more in depth understanding

1:26:53.700 --> 1:26:55.700
 of what the hell we're talking about

1:26:55.700 --> 1:26:57.700
 when we talk about drilling.

1:26:57.700 --> 1:27:03.700
 Ultimately, any movement in the gym

1:27:03.700 --> 1:27:08.700
 that doesn't improve the skills you already have

1:27:08.700 --> 1:27:12.700
 or build new skills is a waste of time,

1:27:12.700 --> 1:27:14.700
 a waste of resources.

1:27:14.700 --> 1:27:17.700
 Everything you do should be done with the aim

1:27:17.700 --> 1:27:19.700
 and the understanding that this is going to make me better

1:27:19.700 --> 1:27:21.700
 at the sport I practice.

1:27:21.700 --> 1:27:24.700
 If it's not, shouldn't be there.

1:27:24.700 --> 1:27:28.700
 The majority of what passes for drilling

1:27:28.700 --> 1:27:31.700
 in most training halls will not make you better,

1:27:31.700 --> 1:27:36.700
 including some of the most cherished forms of drilling,

1:27:36.700 --> 1:27:40.700
 which is repetition for numbers.

1:27:40.700 --> 1:27:42.700
 The moment you say to someone,

1:27:42.700 --> 1:27:44.700
 I want you to do this a hundred times,

1:27:44.700 --> 1:27:47.700
 what are they really thinking about?

1:27:47.700 --> 1:27:49.700
 Volume.

1:27:49.700 --> 1:27:52.700
 They're saying, okay, I'm at repetition 78.

1:27:52.700 --> 1:27:55.700
 I'm at 80, 20 more to go.

1:27:55.700 --> 1:27:59.700
 Their primary thought process is on numbers.

1:27:59.700 --> 1:28:02.700
 That's not the point of drilling.

1:28:02.700 --> 1:28:05.700
 The point is skill acquisition.

1:28:05.700 --> 1:28:09.700
 When people drill, don't get them focused on numbers.

1:28:09.700 --> 1:28:11.700
 Get them focused on mechanics.

1:28:11.700 --> 1:28:13.700
 That's what they have to worry about.

1:28:13.700 --> 1:28:17.700
 I never have my students drill for numbers ever.

1:28:17.700 --> 1:28:20.700
 One, two, three, get the fuck out of here.

1:28:20.700 --> 1:28:21.700
 Are you kidding me?

1:28:21.700 --> 1:28:23.700
 How are you going to get better with that?

1:28:23.700 --> 1:28:27.700
 Get them working on the sense of gaining knowledge.

1:28:27.700 --> 1:28:29.700
 That's my job.

1:28:29.700 --> 1:28:31.700
 I have to give them knowledge.

1:28:31.700 --> 1:28:33.700
 I have to explain to them what they're trying to do.

1:28:33.700 --> 1:28:36.700
 That starts them on the right track.

1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:38.700
 But knowledge is one thing.

1:28:38.700 --> 1:28:40.700
 Skill is another.

1:28:40.700 --> 1:28:43.700
 If Jiu Jitsu was just about knowledge,

1:28:43.700 --> 1:28:48.700
 then all the 60 and 70 year old red belts would be the world champions.

1:28:48.700 --> 1:28:49.700
 They're not.

1:28:49.700 --> 1:28:51.700
 Jiu Jitsu isn't one by knowledge.

1:28:51.700 --> 1:28:53.700
 It's one by skill.

1:28:53.700 --> 1:28:57.700
 Knowledge is the first step in building skill.

1:28:57.700 --> 1:29:01.700
 So my job as a coach is to transmit knowledge.

1:29:01.700 --> 1:29:10.700
 Then I have to create training programs with a path from knowledge to polished skill is carried out.

1:29:10.700 --> 1:29:13.700
 That's the interface between me and my students.

1:29:13.700 --> 1:29:23.700
 And so I give them drills where the whole emphasis is upon getting a sense where they understand

1:29:23.700 --> 1:29:29.700
 what are the problems they're trying to solve and working towards practical solutions.

1:29:29.700 --> 1:29:32.700
 They never work with numbers.

1:29:32.700 --> 1:29:35.700
 They work with mechanics and feel.

1:29:35.700 --> 1:29:39.700
 Then you have to bring in the idea of progression.

1:29:39.700 --> 1:29:44.700
 When you drill, there's zero resistance.

1:29:44.700 --> 1:29:48.700
 When you fight in competition, there's 100% resistance.

1:29:48.700 --> 1:29:52.700
 You can't go from zero to 100.

1:29:52.700 --> 1:30:03.700
 There has to be progress over time where I have them work and drills with slightly increasing increments of resistance.

1:30:03.700 --> 1:30:10.700
 And just as we talked about earlier with the weightlifter who doesn't start with 500 pounds, but who begins with the bar.

1:30:10.700 --> 1:30:16.700
 And then over time builds the skills that one day out there in the future, he will live 500 pounds.

1:30:16.700 --> 1:30:21.700
 So too, that Judy Gattami that you're working on today is feeble and pathetic.

1:30:21.700 --> 1:30:25.700
 But five years from now, you'll win a world championship with it.

1:30:25.700 --> 1:30:29.700
 You can't have this naive idea of drilling as something you just come out.

1:30:29.700 --> 1:30:37.700
 You randomly pick a move and you work for numbers until you satisfied a certain set of numbers that your coach threw at you.

1:30:37.700 --> 1:30:39.700
 And then you think you're going to get better.

1:30:39.700 --> 1:30:45.700
 There's even dangers with drilling.

1:30:45.700 --> 1:30:57.700
 There is no performance increase that comes once you get to a certain level and you just keep doing the same damn thing.

1:30:57.700 --> 1:31:06.700
 Let's say, for example, you come out and you hit 100 repetitions of the armbar, Judy Gattami from guard position.

1:31:06.700 --> 1:31:12.700
 And you're all proud of yourself because you hit 100 repetitions and your body's tired and you're telling yourself, man, I got a good workout.

1:31:12.700 --> 1:31:15.700
 And you come in tomorrow, you do exactly the same thing.

1:31:15.700 --> 1:31:19.700
 You come in the day after that and a week goes by and you've done the same thing.

1:31:19.700 --> 1:31:23.700
 Then a year later, you do the same thing.

1:31:23.700 --> 1:31:29.700
 Ask yourself, has your Judy Gattami really gotten better?

1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:36.700
 No, you've performed literally thousands and thousands of repetitions.

1:31:36.700 --> 1:31:47.700
 You've spent an enormous amount of training time and energy that could have gone in different directions on something which didn't make you any better.

1:31:47.700 --> 1:31:51.700
 Drills have diminishing returns.

1:31:51.700 --> 1:32:02.700
 Once you get to a certain skill level, if you just keep hammering on the same thing in the same fashion for the same amount of time, you stop getting better.

1:32:02.700 --> 1:32:09.700
 Can I partially for fun, partially for dels advocate, but partially because I actually believe this to push back on some points.

1:32:09.700 --> 1:32:11.700
 Is it possible?

1:32:11.700 --> 1:32:15.700
 Everything you said I think is beautiful and correct.

1:32:15.700 --> 1:32:22.700
 But asking yourself the question, am I getting better is a really important one and you could do that in training.

1:32:22.700 --> 1:32:42.700
 Is there a set of techniques, maybe a small subset of all the techniques that are in jiu jitsu, where you can have significant skill acquisition if you put in the numbers or the time, whatever, on a technique against an opponent who's not resisting?

1:32:42.700 --> 1:32:46.700
 Here's, let me elaborate. What I've, in my, maybe I'm different.

1:32:46.700 --> 1:32:48.700
 You probably have to finish an example.

1:32:48.700 --> 1:32:53.700
 Yes. Let me first make a general statement that I can give examples.

1:32:53.700 --> 1:33:04.700
 The general statement is I found that through repetitions, and this is high repetitions, combined with training, but high repetitions against a non resisting opponent.

1:33:04.700 --> 1:33:12.700
 I've gotten to understand the way my body moves, the way I apply pressure on a human.

1:33:12.700 --> 1:33:17.700
 Because it's not actually zero resistance. The opponent is still laying there. They're still keeping their legs up.

1:33:17.700 --> 1:33:22.700
 They're still doing, they might not be resisting, but they're still creating a structure.

1:33:22.700 --> 1:33:23.700
 Yes.

1:33:23.700 --> 1:33:24.700
 A non dynamic structure.

1:33:24.700 --> 1:33:25.700
 They're presenting a target.

1:33:25.700 --> 1:33:42.700
 Yes. It's not dynamic. So you can't master the timing of things, but you can master the, not master, but I felt like I could gain an understanding of how to apply pressure to the human body over thousands of repetitions.

1:33:42.700 --> 1:34:03.700
 Now, for example, I just, just to give you an example to, to know, to know what we're talking about. There's a guy named Salo Hibero and Shandji Hibero that have this, I guess the, I already forgot, but the headquarters position or something like that, but putting pressure as you pass guard, like medium passing distance kind of pressure.

1:34:03.700 --> 1:34:24.700
 I've did thousands of repetitions of that to understand what, what putting pressure with my hips feels like to truly understand that movement. I felt like I was getting much better. It's, it's like, it's hard to put into words, but that skill acquisition is, it's so subtle, just the way you turn your little like hips.

1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:33.700
 But you're already talking about a better form of drilling now. You're going beyond the basic numbers and you're getting the sense of feel and mechanics, which is what we want and drilling.

1:34:33.700 --> 1:34:50.700
 But the reason I say numbers, and maybe you can speak to this, but this might be an OCD thing, but it allows you to take a journey that doesn't just last a week or two weeks, but a journey where you stay with the technique for two, three years.

1:34:50.700 --> 1:35:06.700
 And there's a dedication to it, where it's a long term commitment to where you're forcing yourself, perhaps there's other mechanisms, but you're forcing yourself to stay with the technique longer than most people around you are staying with whatever they're working on.

1:35:06.700 --> 1:35:13.700
 And you're taking that long journey and the numbers somehow enforce that persistence and that dedication.

1:35:13.700 --> 1:35:24.700
 First thing, that journey is a wonderful thing. And if that technique is a crucial part of what you do, then it's time well invested.

1:35:24.700 --> 1:35:34.700
 But always understand that it comes at an opportunity cost that by spending that amount of time on that one technique, you've sacrificed other things that you could have learned that could have won you matches.

1:35:34.700 --> 1:35:42.700
 So understand that every focus upon one element of the game comes at opportunity cost of other elements.

1:35:42.700 --> 1:35:48.700
 Now, as long as you're playing a part of the game where, okay, this is central to what I do.

1:35:48.700 --> 1:35:53.700
 Yes, okay, that's fine. But just be aware of the danger of opportunity cost.

1:35:53.700 --> 1:35:57.700
 That's something no one talks about in the training room, but it becomes very important.

1:35:57.700 --> 1:36:05.700
 Secondly, the other question you have to start asking yourself is, okay, that training clearly had benefits for you early on.

1:36:05.700 --> 1:36:12.700
 But when the point of diminishing returns starts coming in, if you feel you're just doing the same thing, then it's time to switch.

1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:19.700
 Now, if you feel you're still getting benefit from it, by all means continue, that will be a call on your part.

1:36:19.700 --> 1:36:24.700
 You've been playing this game a long time now, so I would trust your call on that.

1:36:24.700 --> 1:36:34.700
 But my job as a coach is to look out and say, okay, this kid's been working across Ashigurami for six months.

1:36:34.700 --> 1:36:37.700
 And I feel he's gotten to a good skill level.

1:36:37.700 --> 1:36:45.700
 If he stays any further on it, the opportunity cost becomes greater than the expected benefits of continuing it.

1:36:45.700 --> 1:36:48.700
 And that's my job as a coach is to direct things in that fashion.

1:36:48.700 --> 1:36:54.700
 If I can do a good job with that, then I can take them to the next level of drilling and start amping it up.

1:36:54.700 --> 1:36:56.700
 And that's how I keep progress over time.

1:36:56.700 --> 1:37:07.700
 My biggest fear is to have students run past the point of diminishing returns, staying stagnant, where opportunity cost comes in,

1:37:07.700 --> 1:37:12.700
 and they're not making the progress they could in the time that they've been working.

1:37:12.700 --> 1:37:15.700
 I mean, that was, it was almost a philosophical question for me.

1:37:15.700 --> 1:37:21.700
 That's what I was always on the search on, because I know my mind is like drilling.

1:37:21.700 --> 1:37:26.700
 I don't like relying on other people for improvement.

1:37:26.700 --> 1:37:32.700
 And drilling allows me to do something that is 100% me.

1:37:32.700 --> 1:37:33.700
 It's interesting, Lex.

1:37:33.700 --> 1:37:38.700
 You say you don't like relying on other people in drilling, but in drilling, you really do rely a lot on your partner.

1:37:38.700 --> 1:37:42.700
 One of the first things I do when I coach people is I teach them how to drill.

1:37:42.700 --> 1:37:44.700
 That's a skill in itself.

1:37:44.700 --> 1:37:52.700
 And drilling is, in a sense, the opposite of sparring.

1:37:52.700 --> 1:38:00.700
 Drilling is a cooperative venture where you work as dance partners, complimenting each other's movement.

1:38:00.700 --> 1:38:10.700
 If I drill with Gordon Ryan and I want him to work on bars, I will move my body in ways which make it an interesting exercise for Gordon.

1:38:10.700 --> 1:38:17.700
 I'm not just sitting there and he does a repetition and I'm, okay, he does 10.

1:38:17.700 --> 1:38:20.700
 I can't wait for this to be over so I can do my 10.

1:38:20.700 --> 1:38:24.700
 And I can't wait for all this to be over so we can just spar and get over all this bullshit.

1:38:24.700 --> 1:38:30.700
 That's the sad truth of most drilling and jiu jitsu.

1:38:30.700 --> 1:38:36.700
 There's a sense in which when good people drill, it's like watching good people dance.

1:38:36.700 --> 1:38:41.700
 They move in unison and compliment each other's movement and make each other look better.

1:38:41.700 --> 1:38:44.700
 Sparring, on the other hand, is the exact opposite of that.

1:38:44.700 --> 1:38:48.700
 That's resistance where you're trying to make that person look as bad as possible.

1:38:48.700 --> 1:38:54.700
 And once you understand the different directions in which drilling and sparring go, that's when things start getting interesting.

1:38:54.700 --> 1:38:56.700
 You start getting fast progress.

1:38:56.700 --> 1:38:58.700
 Yeah, just, you're absolutely right.

1:38:58.700 --> 1:39:02.700
 I think I was not very eloquent in describing what I mean.

1:39:02.700 --> 1:39:12.700
 I found myself not able to find and jiu jitsu too many people that are willing to dedicate a huge amount of time to a particular technique.

1:39:12.700 --> 1:39:14.700
 I concur with you on that.

1:39:14.700 --> 1:39:16.700
 No, answer the interesting question.

1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:18.700
 Why?

1:39:18.700 --> 1:39:20.700
 Why can't you get people to drill with you?

1:39:20.700 --> 1:39:30.700
 By the way, if I could just shout out the people that did drill with me is usually blue belt women because they're smaller.

1:39:30.700 --> 1:39:35.700
 They don't like training because they get their ass kicked because they're much smaller.

1:39:35.700 --> 1:39:44.700
 So they're willing to invest a significant amount of effort into training.

1:39:44.700 --> 1:39:48.700
 That's good, but their motivation for doing so is not good.

1:39:48.700 --> 1:39:52.700
 Yes, but when your motivation for drilling is because you don't want to get your ass kicked, that's not a good motivation.

1:39:52.700 --> 1:39:54.700
 No black belt ever.

1:39:54.700 --> 1:39:58.700
 I could never find a black belt that I could drill with like this.

1:39:58.700 --> 1:40:00.700
 Now let's go back to that question.

1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:02.700
 Why?

1:40:02.700 --> 1:40:06.700
 I'm somebody who likes to say nice things about people.

1:40:06.700 --> 1:40:08.700
 Let me answer for you.

1:40:08.700 --> 1:40:12.700
 Two reasons because they find it boring.

1:40:12.700 --> 1:40:16.700
 And secondly, perhaps more importantly, they don't believe it works.

1:40:16.700 --> 1:40:18.700
 Those are good answers.

1:40:18.700 --> 1:40:22.700
 And now let's go further and ask the truly interesting question.

1:40:22.700 --> 1:40:24.700
 Why do they believe that?

1:40:24.700 --> 1:40:36.700
 If I were to answer it, in the context of Russian wrestling where drilling is much bigger part is, I think, culturally, that was knowledge that everybody tells each other.

1:40:36.700 --> 1:40:43.700
 And Jiu Jitsu that drilling doesn't work.

1:40:43.700 --> 1:40:46.700
 Because they never taught how to drill.

1:40:46.700 --> 1:40:50.700
 No one ever sits you down one day and says, okay, this is how you drill.

1:40:50.700 --> 1:40:54.700
 And so the exercise feels futile.

1:40:54.700 --> 1:40:56.700
 They don't feel the skill level is going up.

1:40:56.700 --> 1:40:58.700
 They don't associate drilling with increased skill level.

1:40:58.700 --> 1:41:10.700
 They associate sparring with increased skill level, but not drilling, which is a tragedy because it is a fantastic way to introduce and expand the repertoire of a developing student.

1:41:10.700 --> 1:41:14.700
 It's an essential part of every workout I teach.

1:41:14.700 --> 1:41:20.700
 I always say that Jiu Jitsu begins with knowledge and builds up the skill.

1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:24.700
 Who wins is the one who has greater skill and nine times out of ten.

1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:32.700
 So to me, it's a tragedy that what you're saying breaks my heart to hear that you couldn't get a black belt to drill with you.

1:41:32.700 --> 1:41:34.700
 That's shameful.

1:41:34.700 --> 1:41:44.700
 And I sympathize with those black belts too because the way in which most people are told to drill does feel ineffective and it is damn boring.

1:41:44.700 --> 1:41:46.700
 They'd rather just spar.

1:41:46.700 --> 1:41:48.700
 They feel like they get more out of the workout.

1:41:48.700 --> 1:41:54.700
 And that's, if anything, an indictment upon most of the training programs around the nation.

1:41:54.700 --> 1:42:02.700
 Would you say that drilling, if you were to build a black belt world champion, would drilling be what percent of their training?

1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:06.700
 In the entirety of their career would be drilling.

1:42:06.700 --> 1:42:08.700
 Great question.

1:42:08.700 --> 1:42:12.700
 Let's first put a provisor on it that I don't do the same thing for all athletes.

1:42:12.700 --> 1:42:14.700
 Everyone's got a different personality.

1:42:14.700 --> 1:42:20.700
 And like Nicky Rod, I can only hold his attention for two minutes at a time.

1:42:20.700 --> 1:42:24.700
 And Gary Tonan, five minutes.

1:42:24.700 --> 1:42:26.700
 Gordon Ryan, five hours.

1:42:26.700 --> 1:42:28.700
 George St. Pierre, five hours.

1:42:28.700 --> 1:42:32.700
 Trevor Stevens, five hours.

1:42:32.700 --> 1:42:34.700
 They are just laser focused.

1:42:34.700 --> 1:42:36.700
 So everyone's different.

1:42:36.700 --> 1:42:38.700
 Let's put that down as a provisor.

1:42:38.700 --> 1:42:42.700
 You probably knew those answers already.

1:42:42.700 --> 1:42:44.700
 That's hilarious.

1:42:44.700 --> 1:42:56.700
 But as a general rule, if I run a two and a half hour class, you can expect an hour and a half of it to be.

1:42:56.700 --> 1:43:04.700
 I'm going to use the word drilling, but I'm also going to say that this is too complex of a story to give now with words I would need to demonstrate it.

1:43:04.700 --> 1:43:08.700
 But the way in which we drill is not your standard method of drilling.

1:43:08.700 --> 1:43:10.700
 And then it's into sparring.

1:43:10.700 --> 1:43:20.700
 But if you give me a choice between a bad drilling partner and sparring, I could make the same choice that most black belts make, which I would go with sparring.

1:43:20.700 --> 1:43:24.700
 Because you can create drilling within the sparring environment.

1:43:24.700 --> 1:43:28.700
 Like good drilling is a wonderful thing.

1:43:28.700 --> 1:43:32.700
 Bad drilling is just a worthless waste of time.

1:43:32.700 --> 1:43:40.700
 Okay. Before I have a million questions for you, but I have to ask, can you, we've described the fundamentals of Jiu Jitsu.

1:43:40.700 --> 1:43:48.700
 Can we describe the principles, the fundamentals of one of the interesting systems you've developed, which is the leg lock system?

1:43:48.700 --> 1:43:54.700
 Yeah, anything in particular or just like a general understanding of what are some of the major principles of it?

1:43:54.700 --> 1:44:02.700
 Well, it's like me coming to Miyamoto Musashi and asking, can you describe the principles of sword fighting?

1:44:02.700 --> 1:44:04.700
 You're too generous.

1:44:04.700 --> 1:44:08.700
 Let's start off with some context.

1:44:08.700 --> 1:44:26.700
 When I began the sport of Jiu Jitsu, I was taught a fairly classical approach to Jiu Jitsu, which leg locks were a part of it, but not an emphasized part of it.

1:44:26.700 --> 1:44:40.700
 The overall culture of the time, this is the mid 1990s, the overall culture of the time saw leg locks as largely ineffective.

1:44:40.700 --> 1:44:47.700
 We were told that against good opposition, they just didn't work very well. They were low percentage techniques.

1:44:47.700 --> 1:45:03.700
 We were also told that they were tactically unsound because if you ever attempted them and you lost control of the leg lock, your opponent would end up on top of you or in some kind of good position and you'd be in terrible trouble.

1:45:03.700 --> 1:45:12.700
 And we're also told that they were unsafe that if they were applied in the gym, there'd be far too many injuries and people would be badly hurt.

1:45:12.700 --> 1:45:20.700
 And that was the received wisdom of that time. And so I didn't even work with them at all.

1:45:20.700 --> 1:45:27.700
 And they would be shown occasionally in the gym and you'd learn them, you'd thrill them.

1:45:27.700 --> 1:45:42.700
 But inspiring, I showed no interest. You probably know that change when I met the great American grappler, Dean Lister, who early in his career was using Achilles locks with considerable success.

1:45:42.700 --> 1:45:47.700
 I met him in the gym, wonderful fellow. And Achilles locks is like a straight full lock.

1:45:47.700 --> 1:45:55.700
 Yes, that's correct. Yes. And he went on to become a heel hooker and win 280cc's later on in his career.

1:45:55.700 --> 1:46:04.700
 But we never met again after that. And that opened some doors of inquiry.

1:46:04.700 --> 1:46:14.700
 Well, he asked this first principles question is why would you only use half the body in a game that involves the human body?

1:46:14.700 --> 1:46:24.700
 Perfect sense. So that opened doors to inquiry. And if you looked around the Jiu Jitsu world at that time, the number of specialized leg lockers,

1:46:24.700 --> 1:46:33.700
 was very small. And most of them were from outside of conventional Jiu Jitsu.

1:46:33.700 --> 1:46:42.700
 For example, you could look around and see people like Romina Sato had sharp leg locks for that time period in the 1990s.

1:46:42.700 --> 1:46:53.700
 So they were out there, they existed. And you'd see people like Ken Shamrock would use heel hooks in competition and he had some good success with them.

1:46:53.700 --> 1:47:03.700
 When I began experimenting with the gym, fairly soon certain truths started to become evident.

1:47:03.700 --> 1:47:12.700
 And the most important of these can be understood very quickly and they were relatively easy to discover.

1:47:12.700 --> 1:47:23.700
 The first was that most people, when they went to understand and study leg locking.

1:47:23.700 --> 1:47:29.700
 And when I talk about leg locking, I'm going to talk about one specific type, which is the most high percentage type.

1:47:29.700 --> 1:47:34.700
 This is leg locks, which are performed with entanglements of your opponent's legs with your legs.

1:47:34.700 --> 1:47:39.700
 There are other forms of leg lock, but these are relatively low percentage and don't figure heavily in competition.

1:47:39.700 --> 1:47:42.700
 So I'll ignore them.

1:47:42.700 --> 1:47:51.700
 Most people made no distinction between the mechanism of control versus the mechanism of breaking.

1:47:51.700 --> 1:47:56.700
 The heel hook is what ultimately breaks the ankle.

1:47:56.700 --> 1:48:01.700
 But the mechanism of control is the entanglement of your legs to your opponent's legs.

1:48:01.700 --> 1:48:05.700
 The Japanese term, ashigurami literally just means leg entanglement.

1:48:05.700 --> 1:48:08.700
 It's a generic term. It could apply to any form of entanglement.

1:48:08.700 --> 1:48:11.700
 There are many options.

1:48:11.700 --> 1:48:20.700
 My idea was let's focus on the entanglement first and worry about the breaking mechanism second.

1:48:20.700 --> 1:48:24.700
 This was analogous to the idea of position before submission.

1:48:24.700 --> 1:48:34.700
 Only you couldn't talk about it in terms of conventional positions because ashigurami doesn't really fit into the traditional hierarchies of jiu jitsu.

1:48:34.700 --> 1:48:41.700
 So the conversation was switch from position to submission to control to submission.

1:48:41.700 --> 1:48:47.700
 Now, wrapping two of your legs around one of your opponent's legs gives you many different options.

1:48:47.700 --> 1:48:51.700
 You can do it with your feet on the outside, so called 50 50 variations.

1:48:51.700 --> 1:48:58.700
 You can do it with your feet on the inside and form what we call inside foot position.

1:48:58.700 --> 1:49:01.700
 There's pros and cons to both.

1:49:01.700 --> 1:49:04.700
 There's also methods of harmonizing the two.

1:49:04.700 --> 1:49:06.700
 So you have one foot on the inside and one foot on the outside.

1:49:06.700 --> 1:49:16.700
 You can do it with a straight leg where you heel hook from the outside or you can bring the leg across your centerline and heel hook from the inside.

1:49:16.700 --> 1:49:25.700
 You will start to notice as you work through these different variations that some present advantages over others.

1:49:25.700 --> 1:49:33.700
 All of them come at a price to some degree regardless of which ashigurami option you use.

1:49:33.700 --> 1:49:41.700
 There will be some degree of foot exposure on my part to my opponent and some degree of back exposure on my part relative to my opponent.

1:49:41.700 --> 1:49:43.700
 So that's the downside of it.

1:49:43.700 --> 1:49:55.700
 Variations within those different ashigurami enable you to lessen danger in some respects and at the price of gaining dangers in others.

1:49:55.700 --> 1:49:59.700
 So you get this wider array of choices.

1:49:59.700 --> 1:50:06.700
 There's not this kind of simplistic hierarchy that you see in the basic positions of Yuditsu, but there are hierarchies.

1:50:06.700 --> 1:50:12.700
 I do, for example, generally favor inside heel hooks over outside heel hooks.

1:50:12.700 --> 1:50:22.700
 If I feel my opponent is very good at exposing my back while I'm in ashigurami, I generally prefer 50, 50 situations.

1:50:22.700 --> 1:50:31.700
 If I believe my opponent is very good at counter leg locks, I generally prefer my feet on the inside working with variations of insides and kakus, et cetera, et cetera.

1:50:31.700 --> 1:50:40.700
 So there are broad heuristic rules that we can give to work in these situations.

1:50:40.700 --> 1:51:00.700
 Once you start to understand there's a variety of entanglements you can use, then you start getting to the really interesting ideas that as you perform one given attack, one given heel hook, you can flow through different forms of ashigurami,

1:51:00.700 --> 1:51:18.700
 where you can create new dangers and avoid possible pitfalls in a very short timeframe as you switch from one ashigurami to another over time so that as your opponent's lines of resistance to an initial attack change,

1:51:18.700 --> 1:51:28.700
 you can accommodate those by switching to another form of ashigurami so that your mechanism of control is always pointing in opposite directions of his escape.

1:51:28.700 --> 1:51:47.700
 And if you focus on this idea of control through the legs, you can completely change the nature of leg locking and take it away from what it was in the 1990s and opportunistic method of attack based upon surprise, speed and power into one based on control.

1:51:47.700 --> 1:52:00.700
 If you can do this, you can undermine many of the basic criticisms of leg locking, which were prevalent when I began the sport of jiu jitsu.

1:52:00.700 --> 1:52:09.700
 For example, if I can completely control and immobilize you, I can perform the lock very, very safely.

1:52:09.700 --> 1:52:19.700
 If my only way of breaking your leg is to be faster and more powerful than you, nine times out of two and when I apply it, I'm going to hurt your leg as much by accident as anything.

1:52:19.700 --> 1:52:33.700
 But if I can completely immobilize you, and as every attempt you make to escape, I can follow you and immobilize you in new directions, then I can apply the lock with as much force or as little force as possible.

1:52:33.700 --> 1:52:50.700
 And so you'll see in our training room, despite over considerably more than two decades, sorry, a decade and a half now of heel hooking using these methods, the number of people severely injured by heel hocks is tiny.

1:52:50.700 --> 1:53:05.700
 I would say I've seen more people injured by far by Kimura's in the time I've been training that I have by heel hocks, despite them having a similar twisting dynamic to them.

1:53:05.700 --> 1:53:14.700
 If you build a culture where people focus on control rather than speed of execution, then the injury rate goes down appreciably.

1:53:14.700 --> 1:53:21.700
 The whole idea of positional loss, everyone was critical of leg locks. Now if you go for leg locks and they don't work, well, now you're in trouble.

1:53:21.700 --> 1:53:25.700
 The guy's going to be on top of you. They never make that criticism with armbars.

1:53:25.700 --> 1:53:30.700
 You can be in a mounted position, go for an armbar, end up on bottom, lose the armbar, and lose position.

1:53:30.700 --> 1:53:33.700
 But I've never heard anyone criticize armbars on that account.

1:53:33.700 --> 1:53:48.700
 More importantly, I believed from early on that the best place to attack leg locks is not top position, it's bottom position. You'll see that over 90% of my athletes attack leg locks from underneath people, not on top of people.

1:53:48.700 --> 1:53:54.700
 So there is no positional loss. You're already underneath them. And so that criticism was null and void.

1:53:54.700 --> 1:54:08.700
 And by focusing on this idea of breaking down and distinguishing between the mechanism of control and the mechanism of breaking, that created something new and something interesting.

1:54:08.700 --> 1:54:16.700
 There was also another advantage that I had in terms of creating influence with leg locking.

1:54:16.700 --> 1:54:29.700
 When you look at the great leg lockers of the past, they were basically iconoclasts. They were people who came out of nowhere who just had this remarkable success with leg locks.

1:54:29.700 --> 1:54:38.700
 But they were just seen as unique individuals. They had their game and they were good at it.

1:54:38.700 --> 1:54:47.700
 What was unique about the squad is you had not just one person, but a team of people who came out and did pretty much the same thing.

1:54:47.700 --> 1:54:52.700
 These people had very different body types and very different personalities.

1:54:52.700 --> 1:55:00.700
 So it wasn't that one kind of body type was good at it. You had tall people like Gordon Ryan. You had short people like Nicky Ryan.

1:55:00.700 --> 1:55:07.700
 You had someone in the middle like Gary Tonan. You had fast people like Gary Tonan. You had slow people like Gordon.

1:55:07.700 --> 1:55:12.700
 There was every kind of body type involved.

1:55:12.700 --> 1:55:21.700
 People could see this was different because it worked for an entire team as opposed to a unique individual who had unique attributes.

1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:30.700
 Then it started to foster the belief that if it can work for a team, it can work for anyone, which means it can work for me.

1:55:30.700 --> 1:55:38.700
 I think that had a big effect. That's why I owe a lot to those early students.

1:55:38.700 --> 1:55:49.700
 Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonan, Eddie Cummins, and Nicky Ryan. Those four kids came from nowhere.

1:55:49.700 --> 1:55:59.700
 Gary had some success in grappling, like low level success in grappling before becoming a full time member of the squad.

1:55:59.700 --> 1:56:04.700
 But the others were just nobodies who no one had known.

1:56:04.700 --> 1:56:18.700
 And yet within a five year timeframe, they were all going up against world championship competition and doing exceedingly well, which gives further credence to the idea of the five year program.

1:56:18.700 --> 1:56:35.700
 And I think by operating as a team, those young men did an incredible job of convincing the grappling world that this wasn't just about whether they're just different or it works for their body type or them as individuals.

1:56:35.700 --> 1:56:43.700
 It was like, no, if a team can do it, anyone can do it. And I think that's what really convinced people that this was something worth studying.

1:56:43.700 --> 1:56:46.700
 This is something that could be a big part of their lives.

1:56:46.700 --> 1:56:57.700
 But it also convinced you and convinced each other in those early days when you're developing the science, essentially what was missing is an entire science and system of leg locks.

1:56:57.700 --> 1:57:04.700
 Because it's not like you knew for sure that there's a lot here to be discovered in terms of control.

1:57:04.700 --> 1:57:17.700
 Perhaps just like you said, an initial intuition, but you have to have enough perseverance required to take is the Johnny Ive thing to take from the initial idea to the entire system.

1:57:17.700 --> 1:57:29.700
 Is there a sense you have about how complicated and how big this world of control in leg locks is?

1:57:29.700 --> 1:57:31.700
 How complicated is it?

1:57:31.700 --> 1:57:42.700
 You've achieved a lot of success. You have a lot of powerful ideas in terms of inside, outside, what's high percentage, what's not, what's high reward, what's low risk, all those kinds of things.

1:57:42.700 --> 1:57:52.700
 And then you also mentioned transitions, not transitions, but how you move with your opponent to resist their escape through control.

1:57:52.700 --> 1:57:55.700
 How much do you understand about this world?

1:57:55.700 --> 1:57:58.700
 This is a fascinating question.

1:57:58.700 --> 1:58:10.700
 As a general rule, the most powerful developments are always at the onset of a project.

1:58:10.700 --> 1:58:12.700
 Let's give an example.

1:58:12.700 --> 1:58:31.700
 The jet engine was, I believe, first conceived in the late 1930s, just around the time of World War II. It was developed with great pace because of World War II, that obviously military research was a huge thing back then.

1:58:31.700 --> 1:58:38.700
 And first fielded, I believe, by the Germans in around 1943.

1:58:38.700 --> 1:58:51.700
 The jet aircraft didn't play a big role in World War II. They were there at the end and they did play a significant role, but in terms of numbers, they just weren't there.

1:58:51.700 --> 1:59:05.700
 So by around 1945, you had the onset of the jet age and the jet engine began to replace the piston engine in most aircraft. It was the new way of doing things.

1:59:05.700 --> 1:59:20.700
 If you look at the pace of development of jet engine aircraft technology from 1945 to 1960, it is unbelievable.

1:59:20.700 --> 1:59:35.700
 There was a solid decade where they were gaining almost 100 miles an hour per year for a decade. That's a form of growth in the world of engineering.

1:59:35.700 --> 1:59:43.700
 The only time you see growth like that is in things like Bitcoin. That's about it.

1:59:43.700 --> 2:00:03.700
 Let's put things in perspective. In World War II, the standard US aircraft bomber was the B17, which was a midsize bomber with a fairly limited load capacity and I think top speed well below 300 miles an hour.

2:00:03.700 --> 2:00:19.700
 Just 10 years later, you had the B52, which could fly across continents and deliver nuclear weapons and carry bomb loads of up to 70,000 pounds in a decade that happened.

2:00:19.700 --> 2:00:35.700
 If you took a B17 pilot in 1943 and put them inside a B52 a decade later, he would literally think he was on a UFO, a ship from another planet. That was the speed of development.

2:00:35.700 --> 2:00:54.700
 Now contrast that with the speed of modern development. If I took you in a time machine and I put you in a civil airliner in 1972, let's say a Boeing 737, it's not that different from what you fly in today.

2:00:54.700 --> 2:01:02.700
 It flies at the same speed, has the same range, flies at the same altitude. It's not that different.

2:01:02.700 --> 2:01:17.700
 The amount of progress between 1973 and 2020 isn't very impressive, but the amount of progress from 1945 to 1955 or even better 1960 was staggering.

2:01:17.700 --> 2:01:27.700
 And so the initial progress tends to be meteoric, but after that tends to be incremental. You see that with Lake Longs.

2:01:27.700 --> 2:01:45.700
 There's a guy named Elon Musk. There's been almost no development in terms of space rocket propulsion and rocket launches and going out into orbit or going out into deep space.

2:01:45.700 --> 2:02:00.700
 And one guy comes along, one John Donner type character and says, it doesn't make sense why we don't use reusable rockets, why we don't make it much cheaper, why we don't launch every week as opposed to every few years.

2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:08.700
 It doesn't make any sense why we don't go to the moon again over and over and over. It doesn't make any sense why we don't go to Mars and colonize Mars.

2:02:08.700 --> 2:02:23.700
 It feels like it's not just a single jump to a B52. It's a series of these kinds of jumps. So the question is, is there another leap within the leg locking system?

2:02:23.700 --> 2:02:36.700
 Time will tell. I do believe that we're in a phase now where the really big jumps have already been made and we're in the incremental phase at this point.

2:02:36.700 --> 2:02:48.700
 What I do believe is that you will start to see new directions start to emerge where you start to see the interface between leg locking and race lane, for example, the interface between leg locking and back attacks.

2:02:48.700 --> 2:02:56.700
 And that will provide new avenues of direction, which will create new spurts of growth.

2:02:56.700 --> 2:03:06.700
 But in terms of breaking people's legs, this is the simple act of breaking legs, I believe we're in the incremental phase now rather than the meteoric phase.

2:03:06.700 --> 2:03:15.700
 Let me ask you a ridiculous question. How hard is it to actually break a leg? Is this something you think about? I remember, because I'm a big fan of the straight foot lock.

2:03:15.700 --> 2:03:26.700
 Again, we're talking about to the standing Saiyanagi. Maybe it's my Russian roots with Sambo or something like that. Maybe it's the Dean Lister, Achilles lock.

2:03:26.700 --> 2:03:37.700
 But I love, maybe it's my body, something like that. I just love the squeeze of it, the control and the power of a straight foot lock.

2:03:37.700 --> 2:03:46.700
 And I remember trying to, there's a few people in competition that didn't want to tap. Absolutely.

2:03:46.700 --> 2:03:57.700
 And I remember in particular, there was one person, again, a finals match purple belt. I remember it was a straight foot lock, it was perfect. Everything just perfect.

2:03:57.700 --> 2:04:08.700
 And I remember going all in and there was a pop, pop, pop. And I couldn't do anything more. It wasn't breaking. It was just bending and bending and bending.

2:04:08.700 --> 2:04:19.700
 And there's damage to it of some kind. But I wanted to see, first of all, it was very difficult psychologically because it's like, can I be violent here?

2:04:19.700 --> 2:04:27.700
 That was another thing. With adrenaline, you can't really think that fast. But I also thought like, where else is there to go?

2:04:27.700 --> 2:04:31.700
 Like, is it the shin going to break? What is supposed to break? So I wondered that.

2:04:31.700 --> 2:04:35.700
 In the case of the Achilles lock, it's going to be the anterior tibialis tendon.

2:04:35.700 --> 2:04:36.700
 What's that?

2:04:36.700 --> 2:04:43.700
 It runs down. There's two of them. It'll be the minor one that runs on the outside of the front of the ankle. It's not going to be the Achilles tendon.

2:04:43.700 --> 2:04:50.700
 A lot of people promulgate this absurdity. The Achilles tendon can rupture, but not from pressure.

2:04:50.700 --> 2:04:53.700
 Is it the tendon or the bone that's going to break?

2:04:53.700 --> 2:05:00.700
 The bone won't break. I have seen on one occasion a shin bone break from an Achilles lock.

2:05:00.700 --> 2:05:08.700
 But there was the enormous size and strength disparity. And there may have been other complicating factors too.

2:05:08.700 --> 2:05:14.700
 But in the vast majority of cases, the Achilles lock doesn't really do tremendous damage.

2:05:14.700 --> 2:05:17.700
 It can do significant damage. You'll definitely feel it the next day.

2:05:17.700 --> 2:05:27.700
 But of all the major locks, it's the one where it is most likely a psychologically strong opponent will be able to absorb damage and go on to win a match.

2:05:27.700 --> 2:05:32.700
 In answer to your first question, how difficult is it to break a leg?

2:05:32.700 --> 2:05:38.700
 Not very difficult. It will come down to what is the skill level of my opponent's resistance.

2:05:38.700 --> 2:05:43.700
 If your opponent is not resisting and you have an inside heel hook, it is absurdly easy to break a man's leg.

2:05:43.700 --> 2:05:56.700
 Not a challenge at all. You can be a 105 pound woman who could easily snap the relevant knee ligaments in a 240 pound man's leg

2:05:56.700 --> 2:06:01.700
 if he doesn't know how to defend himself. That's an easy thing, very easy to accomplish.

2:06:01.700 --> 2:06:05.700
 So the basic answer is yes, it's very easy.

2:06:05.700 --> 2:06:14.700
 If your opponent does know how to defend and they can position their foot, play tricks of lever and fulcrum, it becomes significantly more difficult.

2:06:14.700 --> 2:06:23.700
 It becomes still more difficult under match conditions where they're actively looking to position their body and work their way out of the lock.

2:06:23.700 --> 2:06:42.700
 Then it can become very difficult indeed. Always bear in mind that there are some cases in history as a team where people have literally just let their knees snap and continue fighting.

2:06:42.700 --> 2:06:56.700
 Always remember that submission is a choice when it comes to the joint locks. We've had some people who just made the choice that I'm willing to let my knee break so that I can continue in this match.

2:06:56.700 --> 2:07:00.700
 That's a tough decision to make and I admire their bravery.

2:07:00.700 --> 2:07:04.700
 Is there something about that, just to speak to that, that you admire?

2:07:04.700 --> 2:07:13.700
 Yes, it's mental toughness. Would I agree with it? Would I advocate it? No, but that doesn't mean I can't admire aspects of it.

2:07:13.700 --> 2:07:17.700
 Who is the greatest grappler ever?

2:07:17.700 --> 2:07:27.700
 You were very astute in the way you asked that question. You didn't say the greatest jujitsu player of all time, you specified grappler.

2:07:27.700 --> 2:07:29.700
 What's the bigger category?

2:07:29.700 --> 2:07:41.700
 Of course. Jujitsu is the bigger category. Jujitsu has four faces. There is gi competition. There is no gi competition. There is mixed martial arts competition and there is self defense.

2:07:41.700 --> 2:07:52.700
 So Jujitsu has four aspects. Grappling typically refers only to the no gi aspect of Jujitsu. So it's one out of four possibilities.

2:07:52.700 --> 2:07:58.700
 So who's the greatest jujitsu practitioner ever and then who is the greatest grappler ever?

2:07:58.700 --> 2:08:15.700
 I believe that the greatest jujitsu player, certainly that I ever met and I believe of all time, I don't want to sound arrogant on that because really you can only go with your own experiences and there are some great athletes that other people mentioned that I just never met.

2:08:15.700 --> 2:08:36.700
 But in my estimation, the greatest jujitsu player is Hodja Gracie. My reasoning for that is out of the four faces of Jujitsu, he excelled in three and in two of them in particular, he was the best of his generation by a landslide.

2:08:36.700 --> 2:08:50.700
 In gi grappling, no gi grappling, Hodja dominated his generation to a degree that is truly impressive.

2:08:50.700 --> 2:08:55.700
 What do you attribute that dominance to by the way? Is there something if you were to analyze him?

2:08:55.700 --> 2:09:08.700
 Fascinating question, I'll come back to it. In mixed martial arts, he was at his peak, I believe ranked in the top 10 in the world of mixed martial arts.

2:09:08.700 --> 2:09:16.700
 He wasn't the best in mixed martial arts the way he was in grappling, but he was damn good and he beats in significant people.

2:09:16.700 --> 2:09:27.700
 So he showed tremendous versatility, gi, no gi, mixed martial arts. He's not really known in the world of self defense, but there's no real criteria by which you would become dominant in self defense.

2:09:27.700 --> 2:09:35.700
 So that's kind of a, you can't really judge people by that. Believe me, if Hodja got into a fight in the street, I'm sure he would do just fine.

2:09:35.700 --> 2:10:00.700
 So I have no concerns about that. So I would say that if you look at juditsu for what I believe it is, a sport with four faces, I believe it's, you have to go with Hodja Gracie as the one who went out and empirically proved his ability to go across those elements and do extraordinarily well in all of them.

2:10:00.700 --> 2:10:09.700
 He even made the extraordinary step of coming out of retirement and beating the best of the generation that came after him.

2:10:09.700 --> 2:10:11.700
 That's a truly difficult thing.

2:10:11.700 --> 2:10:12.700
 Yeah, that was incredible.

2:10:12.700 --> 2:10:17.700
 And a sport which progresses very, very rapidly, that's a truly impressive accomplishment.

2:10:17.700 --> 2:10:28.700
 If you ask the question, who is the greatest grappler that I've ever seen, I would say I've never seen anyone better than Gordon Ryan.

2:10:28.700 --> 2:10:32.700
 Now, people are going to jump when I give these two names.

2:10:32.700 --> 2:10:38.700
 They're going to say, well, Dan, you're close friends with Hodja and you're close friends with Gordon, so you're biased.

2:10:38.700 --> 2:10:44.700
 I can't answer them to that. It's true. I'm good friends with both of them.

2:10:44.700 --> 2:10:59.700
 I'm also a notoriously cold and unemotional person and I'm saying this based upon things that I've observed. If I honestly believed that I'd seen other people who were better, I would have said it.

2:10:59.700 --> 2:11:09.700
 Will that convince the people who criticized me of bias? Probably not. But those are the two names that I will mention.

2:11:09.700 --> 2:11:17.700
 I think it's uncontroversial statement to say that Gordon Ryan is one of the greatest grappler ever.

2:11:17.700 --> 2:11:26.700
 Gordon is obviously a very polarizing figure and people tend to react to Gordon on an emotional level rather than a statistical level.

2:11:26.700 --> 2:11:29.700
 And that colors a lot of people's minds.

2:11:29.700 --> 2:11:36.700
 But I also have the benefit that I've seen both of these guys extensively in the gym and that adds a whole new perspective.

2:11:36.700 --> 2:11:41.700
 Do you think those guys are dominant on the stage? Where do you see them in the gym?

2:11:41.700 --> 2:11:47.700
 It's even a different level of domination above and beyond what they did in competition.

2:11:47.700 --> 2:11:50.700
 Have they trained against each other in the gym?

2:11:50.700 --> 2:11:53.700
 No, they've never trained together. They've been in the same gym, I think, only on one occasion.

2:11:53.700 --> 2:11:59.700
 When Hodja was stopped by New York, he came by to say hello and Gordon was here at the time.

2:11:59.700 --> 2:12:04.700
 They shake hands. They know each other. They're both wonderful people in their own way.

2:12:04.700 --> 2:12:12.700
 So I'd like to talk to you about Gordon, Hodja, and George, GSB.

2:12:12.700 --> 2:12:16.700
 Let's first talk about what do you think is very different from my perspective.

2:12:16.700 --> 2:12:23.700
 Maybe you can correct me, but very different artists, masters of their pursuits.

2:12:23.700 --> 2:12:27.700
 So what makes Hodja so good?

2:12:27.700 --> 2:12:40.700
 Hodja was probably the living embodiment of someone who played a classical Jiu Jitsu game based around the fundamental four steps of Jiu Jitsu.

2:12:40.700 --> 2:12:50.700
 If you took someone who had taken introduction lessons in Jiu Jitsu for three months,

2:12:50.700 --> 2:13:01.700
 they would recognize the outlines of Hodja's game with many of the techniques they learned in those first three months.

2:13:01.700 --> 2:13:09.700
 Hodja was the best example of the dichotomy between the fundamentals of Jiu Jitsu,

2:13:09.700 --> 2:13:16.700
 but also a kind of hidden sophistication underneath those fundamentals.

2:13:16.700 --> 2:13:23.700
 People always say, Hodja's game was so basic. No, the outlines of Hodja's game were basic,

2:13:23.700 --> 2:13:29.700
 but the degree of sophistication and the application was extraordinary.

2:13:29.700 --> 2:13:38.700
 And his ability to refine existing technology was truly impressive.

2:13:38.700 --> 2:13:48.700
 I never saw anyone in his generation that even came close to his ability both in competition and in the gym.

2:13:48.700 --> 2:13:52.700
 So for people who don't know, Hodja Gracie basically used, just like you said,

2:13:52.700 --> 2:13:59.700
 very simple techniques on the surface from the outsider's perspective

2:13:59.700 --> 2:14:09.700
 that most people learn when they start Jiu Jitsu like passing guard in a very simple way, taking mount and choking from mount.

2:14:09.700 --> 2:14:17.700
 Also, when he's on his back, his close guard and all the basic submissions from close guard, arm bar and triangle.

2:14:17.700 --> 2:14:20.700
 And just that's it.

2:14:20.700 --> 2:14:25.700
 And being able to dominate, shut down and submit.

2:14:25.700 --> 2:14:31.700
 So control and submit the best people in the world for many, many years, just like you said,

2:14:31.700 --> 2:14:39.700
 including coming out of retirement and beating the best, perhaps by far the best of the next generation.

2:14:39.700 --> 2:14:42.700
 So that just kind of lays out the story.

2:14:42.700 --> 2:14:51.700
 Is there some lessons about his systems that you learn in developing your own systems?

2:14:51.700 --> 2:14:53.700
 Excellent question.

2:14:53.700 --> 2:15:05.700
 The thing which always impressed me the most about Hodja was his relentless pursuit of position to submission.

2:15:05.700 --> 2:15:16.700
 Everything was done with the belief that no victory was worthwhile if it didn't involve submitting his opponent.

2:15:16.700 --> 2:15:21.700
 That's a mindset that I try very, very hard to imbue in my students.

2:15:21.700 --> 2:15:26.700
 The easiest path to victory in Jiu Jitsu is the one which takes the least risk.

2:15:26.700 --> 2:15:33.700
 So for example, you will see many modern athletes focus on scoring the first point or the first advantage

2:15:33.700 --> 2:15:39.700
 and then doing the minimum amount of work to eke out a victory once they've done that.

2:15:39.700 --> 2:15:41.700
 They get a small tactical advantage.

2:15:41.700 --> 2:15:48.700
 They realize they're ahead, take no more risks and just do the minimum amount of work to get the victory.

2:15:48.700 --> 2:16:00.700
 Hodja's mindset was always to take the riskier gambit of submission, which entails a lot more work and in many cases a lot more skill.

2:16:00.700 --> 2:16:05.700
 What I always liked about Hodja is he never tried to play tactics.

2:16:05.700 --> 2:16:10.700
 It was always just go out there and try to win by submission.

2:16:10.700 --> 2:16:24.700
 And that more than anything, that mindset of looking for the most perfect victory rather than the victory that takes the least skill and the least effort

2:16:24.700 --> 2:16:31.700
 is probably the thing I took from his career the most and tried to work upon in my students.

2:16:31.700 --> 2:16:39.700
 I always wonder what are the little details he's doing under there when he's in mount, the little adjustments.

2:16:39.700 --> 2:16:47.700
 But perhaps that's almost indescribable the details of that control.

2:16:47.700 --> 2:16:53.700
 What makes Gordon Ryan the greatest grappler of all time so good?

2:16:53.700 --> 2:16:57.700
 With Gordon, he's also very strong on fundamentals that all of my students are.

2:16:57.700 --> 2:17:10.700
 But he's also obviously a member of a new generation of Nogi grapplers that also bring in technologies that weren't really emphasized in previous generations,

2:17:10.700 --> 2:17:19.700
 specifically the prolific use of lower body attacks, especially from bottom position.

2:17:19.700 --> 2:17:28.700
 This means that he can play a game between upper body and lower body, which was not really a part of Hodja's game.

2:17:28.700 --> 2:17:31.700
 Nonetheless, you will also see significant similarities.

2:17:31.700 --> 2:17:41.700
 He's got a very strong and crushing passing game to mount and very strong and crushing passing game to the back.

2:17:41.700 --> 2:17:48.700
 You will see that the major differences between the two are from bottom position.

2:17:48.700 --> 2:17:51.700
 Hodja's bottom game is essentially based around his closed guard.

2:17:51.700 --> 2:17:54.700
 Gordon Ryan's game is based around his butterfly guard.

2:17:54.700 --> 2:17:59.700
 So one is based on outside control and one is based on inside control.

2:17:59.700 --> 2:18:05.700
 One focuses almost entirely on the classical notion of getting past the legs to the upper body.

2:18:05.700 --> 2:18:09.700
 And the other one works between the two as alternatives and sees them as competing alternatives.

2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:15.700
 Where the stronger you become at one, the more your opponent has to overreact and become vulnerable to the second.

2:18:15.700 --> 2:18:21.700
 So they have strong similarities in top position, but are very different in bottom.

2:18:21.700 --> 2:18:34.700
 He has, from an outsider's perspective, a calm to him in the heat of battle that's inspiring and confusing.

2:18:34.700 --> 2:18:39.700
 Is there something to speak to the psychological aspect of Gordon Ryan?

2:18:39.700 --> 2:18:55.700
 Yes, people will talk all day about sports psychology and they will often have heated arguments as to what's the right psychological state to be in when you go out to compete.

2:18:55.700 --> 2:19:03.700
 I've never seen any one school of thought which gave noticeably better sports performance than another.

2:19:03.700 --> 2:19:13.700
 I've never seen any psychological mindset prove to be reliably more efficient or effective than another.

2:19:13.700 --> 2:19:20.700
 I've seen fighters that were scared out of their minds when they went out every time to fight and yet they were very successful.

2:19:20.700 --> 2:19:25.700
 I've seen fighters go out who were relaxed and calm and they too can be successful.

2:19:25.700 --> 2:19:31.700
 I've seen both mindsets win. I've seen both mindsets lose. I've seen every extreme between them.

2:19:31.700 --> 2:19:38.700
 What I generally recommend with regards to your mind and preparation going in, find what works for you.

2:19:38.700 --> 2:19:45.700
 Everyone's different. Don't try to give a one size fits all and something as vague and confusing as the human mind.

2:19:45.700 --> 2:19:53.700
 Having said that, my preference, I don't force it on people because everyone's different,

2:19:53.700 --> 2:20:00.700
 but my preference is to try and advocate for a mindset of unexceptionalism.

2:20:00.700 --> 2:20:06.700
 Most people see competition as something exceptional. It's not your everyday grappling session.

2:20:06.700 --> 2:20:14.700
 You train 300 times for every time you compete and so they see competition as something exceptional, different, scarier or nerve wracking.

2:20:14.700 --> 2:20:23.700
 There's a crowd watching these cameras. My reputation is on the line. I'm going to be observed and judged and so they see it as this exceptional event.

2:20:23.700 --> 2:20:33.700
 My general preference is to see it as an exceptional event, to see everything else, the noise, the cameras, the crowd as illusions.

2:20:33.700 --> 2:20:42.700
 The only reality is a stage, an opponent on the other side of it and a referee adjudicating you and to make it as unexceptional as possible.

2:20:42.700 --> 2:20:47.700
 Gordon does an extraordinarily good job of doing that.

2:20:47.700 --> 2:21:00.700
 Gordon looks more tense in most of his training sessions than he does in his competitions because he knows his training partners are typically better than the people he's actually going out to compete against.

2:21:00.700 --> 2:21:05.700
 You see it in his demeanor. It's one of just complete calm.

2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:10.700
 It also goes back to what we talked about earlier about the power of escapes.

2:21:10.700 --> 2:21:20.700
 Gordon Ryan is almost impossible to control for extended periods of time in most of the inferior positions in the sport and most of the submissions.

2:21:20.700 --> 2:21:29.700
 He goes out in the full knowledge that the worst case scenario isn't that bad for him and so nothing could really go that badly wrong.

2:21:29.700 --> 2:21:36.700
 He can always recover from any given mistake and go on to victory. When you believe those things, you're going to have a calm demeanor.

2:21:36.700 --> 2:21:56.700
 Then if you look at somebody who is quite a bit different than that, George St. Pierre, who at least in the way he describes it, he's basically exceptionally anxious and terrified approaching a fight and he loves training and hates fighting.

2:21:56.700 --> 2:22:14.700
 Just like you said, he made it work for him. He speaks very highly of you. He's worked with you quite a bit in training and you've studied him. You've worked with him. You've coached him.

2:22:14.700 --> 2:22:26.700
 Interestingly, I've actually coached George for twice the lengths of any of the squad members. My knowledge of him is far greater than it is for the contemporary squad.

2:22:26.700 --> 2:22:47.700
 He speaks to what makes George St. Pierre, who I think even though I'm Russian and a little bit partial towards Fedor and the Russians, but I think he is in the four categories you mentioned, the greatest mixed martial artist of all time. What makes him so good? His approach, his techniques, his mind.

2:22:47.700 --> 2:23:04.700
 His approach is certainly part of it. George started mixed martial arts at a time when the sport was in a pretty wild phase. It was illegal to show on most American TV networks.

2:23:04.700 --> 2:23:20.700
 There was talk about it being banned as a sport. In his native Canada, it was banned. You could only fight on Indian reservations in Canada. I believe his first fight may have been on Indian reservation.

2:23:20.700 --> 2:23:44.700
 The sport at that stage was very much in its infancy. It's probably fair to say that most of the athletes involved in the sport came from a training program that would probably be described as unprofessional in the contemporary scene.

2:23:44.700 --> 2:23:56.700
 George is one of a handful of people who started approaching the sport in a truly professional fashion. He was like, okay, here's what great athletes in other sports do. I'm going to try to emulate that.

2:23:56.700 --> 2:24:16.700
 His ability to invest in himself, in my own experience, for example, George, when I first met him, was a garbage man. He would jump on a bus from Montreal to New York. That's a long bus ride.

2:24:16.700 --> 2:24:27.700
 He would come down on a Friday afternoon when he finished work as a garbage man, stay for the weekend, and then late on Sunday night, he would jump on a bus all the way back to Montreal and work as a garbage man.

2:24:27.700 --> 2:24:49.700
 That's an extraordinary commitment for a young man to make. George was a blue belt at the time. He would come down and we had a very talented room. He didn't do well in the room when he first came in. He was inexperienced in Jiu Jitsu.

2:24:49.700 --> 2:25:07.700
 The people who went against were considerably better than him at Jiu Jitsu. Imagine investing 25% of your weekly income, maybe even more, in New York's inexpensive town, 50%, to come down and just get your ass kicked, month by month.

2:25:07.700 --> 2:25:21.700
 That tells you a lot. First of all, let's talk about the whole idea of delayed gratification. That's the guy who's saying, this is highly unpleasant, but I have a vision of myself in the future.

2:25:21.700 --> 2:25:34.700
 I have to go through this extreme case of delayed gratification to get to that distant goal, which may never happen. That's the level of commitment and self belief, which is just extraordinary.

2:25:34.700 --> 2:25:49.700
 I always laugh when people say, George was afraid, so he was mentally weak. That's a very, very shallow understanding of mental strength and weakness.

2:25:49.700 --> 2:26:09.700
 George felt anxiety, but let's understand from the start, there's different kinds of mental strength. The most important kind isn't whether you feel fear or don't feel fear before you step into fight. The most important form of mental strength is discipline and training.

2:26:09.700 --> 2:26:19.700
 That's where most people break. I know dozens of people who are fearless to fight, but you couldn't get them to come into the gym for three months in a row and work on skills.

2:26:19.700 --> 2:26:28.700
 They're mentally strong one way, they don't feel fear, but they're mentally weak in another, which is to instill the discipline which keeps you on a road to progress over time.

2:26:28.700 --> 2:26:38.700
 That's much tougher than not feeling fear before you go out to fight. Understand also that when George talks about fear, he's not afraid of his opponent.

2:26:38.700 --> 2:26:49.700
 He's afraid of failure. He's got high standards. Someone who's got high standards can change the world.

2:26:49.700 --> 2:26:58.700
 His standards were very, very high. That's what he was afraid of. He wasn't afraid of his opponent. That's always been the misinterpretation.

2:26:58.700 --> 2:27:13.700
 He wasn't mentally weak. He was mentally strong as an ox to stay in his training regimen year after year after year and do so while he became one of the first stars in mixed martial arts to actually make money.

2:27:13.700 --> 2:27:19.700
 It gets tough to stay in the training gym with people who are young and hungry and want to punch you in the face.

2:27:19.700 --> 2:27:27.700
 You're coming out of a luxury room living in finery towards the end of his career and still training as hard as ever. That's an impressive thing.

2:27:27.700 --> 2:27:36.700
 And always he valued perfection and you're right. The fear was not achieving the perfection.

2:27:36.700 --> 2:27:47.700
 Is there something you've observed about the way he approaches training that stands out to you? Is it simply the dedication?

2:27:47.700 --> 2:27:56.700
 No, it's never just about dedication. There's lots of dedicated people in the world but most of them are unsuccessful.

2:27:56.700 --> 2:28:07.700
 If you want to be the best in the world at anything you have to do out of the many skills of whatever industry you're in.

2:28:07.700 --> 2:28:17.700
 You have to take at least one of those skills and be the best in the world at it.

2:28:17.700 --> 2:28:27.700
 There's many skills in mixed martial arts but George identified one skill which is the skill of striking to take down.

2:28:27.700 --> 2:28:38.700
 He calls it shootboxing. Shootboxing was barely even a category of skill when George began.

2:28:38.700 --> 2:28:48.700
 It's just the idea that wrestlers grabbed people and took them down the same way they did in wrestling and you threw some punches before you did it.

2:28:48.700 --> 2:29:02.700
 George largely pioneered the science of creating an interface between striking and takedowns.

2:29:02.700 --> 2:29:11.700
 He did it at a time where no one else before him had made it into a system or a science.

2:29:11.700 --> 2:29:24.700
 He did it largely on his own and I've always said George is the only athlete that I ever coached who taught me more than I taught him.

2:29:24.700 --> 2:29:43.700
 And almost singlehandedly he created this strong sense of shootboxing as a science which enabled him throughout his career to determine where the fight would take place.

2:29:43.700 --> 2:29:53.700
 Would it be standing or would it be on the ground and that more than anything else was the defining characteristic of his success.

2:29:53.700 --> 2:29:59.700
 I will always be immensely impressed by his accomplishment in that regard.

2:29:59.700 --> 2:30:02.700
 He was an innovator. He did things differently.

2:30:02.700 --> 2:30:13.700
 This is such an important point. You can't go out there in combat sports and do the same things that everybody else is doing and expect to get different results.

2:30:13.700 --> 2:30:23.700
 Life doesn't work that way. If you want to be dominant you got to find one important part of the sport and preferably more than one and be the best in the world at it.

2:30:23.700 --> 2:30:27.700
 You can't be weak at anything but you can't be strong at everything either.

2:30:27.700 --> 2:30:31.700
 Life's not long enough for us to develop a truly complete skill set.

2:30:31.700 --> 2:30:35.700
 So you got to be good at everything and you got to be the best at at least one thing.

2:30:35.700 --> 2:30:48.700
 And George was the best at two in his era. He was the best at striking to takedowns and he was the best at integrating striking and grappling on the floor.

2:30:48.700 --> 2:30:57.700
 Let me ask you a completely ridiculous question but it's a fascinating one for me from an engineering and a scientific perspective.

2:30:57.700 --> 2:31:12.700
 When I look at a sport, really any problem, one way to ask how difficult is this problem is to see how can I build a machine that competes with a human being at that problem.

2:31:12.700 --> 2:31:21.700
 You can look at chess, you can look at soccer, RoboCup and then you can look at grappling.

2:31:21.700 --> 2:31:30.700
 There's something about when you start to think how would I build an AI system, a robot that defeats somebody like a Gordon Ryan.

2:31:30.700 --> 2:31:40.700
 Where it forces you to really think about formalizing this art as an engineering discipline.

2:31:40.700 --> 2:31:45.700
 In the same way you do but you still have some art injected in there.

2:31:45.700 --> 2:31:48.700
 There is no space for art when you actually have to build the system.

2:31:48.700 --> 2:31:52.700
 That's not a ridiculous question. That's a damn interesting question.

2:31:52.700 --> 2:32:02.700
 Let's put aside, like I mentioned with the Boston Dynamics spot robots, what people don't realize is the amount of power they can deliver is huge.

2:32:02.700 --> 2:32:07.700
 So let's take that weapon aside. Just the amount of force you're able to deliver.

2:32:07.700 --> 2:32:10.700
 I'm glad you're specifying that.

2:32:10.700 --> 2:32:18.700
 Essentially your question is can a talented group of engineers create a robot which could defeat Gordon Ryan?

2:32:18.700 --> 2:32:24.700
 On the face of it, as you just pointed out, that's the easiest project in the world.

2:32:24.700 --> 2:32:28.700
 Just create a robot that carries a 90mm automatic and shoot him five times in the chest.

2:32:28.700 --> 2:32:31.700
 That's that Gordon Ryan's done. That's not the interesting question.

2:32:31.700 --> 2:32:44.700
 The interesting question, and if I understand you correctly, is if we had the ability to create a robot whose physical powers were identical to Gordon Ryan,

2:32:44.700 --> 2:32:53.700
 not inferior and not superior, what would it take to create a mind inside that robot that would beat Gordon Ryan in the majority of matches?

2:32:53.700 --> 2:33:02.700
 There's two ways to build AI systems. This is true for autonomous driving, for example, which has been quite contested recently.

2:33:02.700 --> 2:33:08.700
 One way to describe it is you have a giant set of rules.

2:33:08.700 --> 2:33:12.700
 It's like this tree of rules where you apply a different condition.

2:33:12.700 --> 2:33:16.700
 When there's a pattern you see, you apply a rule and they're hard coded in.

2:33:16.700 --> 2:33:28.700
 You basically get like a John Donner type of character who tries to encode hard code into the system, all the moves you should do in every single case.

2:33:28.700 --> 2:33:36.700
 Of course, you can't actually do that fully, so you're going to be taking shortcuts, what are called heuristics.

2:33:36.700 --> 2:33:48.700
 These are basic generalizations and apply your own expertise as an expert of, in this case, grappling to see how that can be encoded as a rule.

2:33:48.700 --> 2:34:04.700
 Now, the other approach, Elon Musk and Tesla are taking this approach, which is called machine learning, which is create a basic framework of the kind of things you should be observing.

2:34:04.700 --> 2:34:08.700
 What are the measures, metrics of success?

2:34:08.700 --> 2:34:15.700
 Then just observe and see which things lead to success, more success and which lead to less success.

2:34:15.700 --> 2:34:25.700
 There's a delta. When you see a thing, first of all, the way machine learning works is you predict, you see a position or you see a situation,

2:34:25.700 --> 2:34:36.700
 and then you predict how good that is, and then you watch how it actually turns out, and if it's worse or better, you adjust your expectations through that process.

2:34:36.700 --> 2:34:51.700
 You can learn quite a lot. The challenge is, and this might be a very true challenge in grappling, is in driving, you can't crash.

2:34:51.700 --> 2:35:01.700
 There's a physical world. In chess, for example, where this approach has been exceptionally successful, you can work in simulations.

2:35:01.700 --> 2:35:15.700
 You can have an AI system that, for example, as in the case with AlphaZero by DeepMind, Google's DeepMind, it can play itself in simulation millions of times, billions of times.

2:35:15.700 --> 2:35:27.700
 It's difficult to know if it's possible to do that in simulation for anything that involves human movement, like grappling.

2:35:27.700 --> 2:35:40.700
 My sense is, if we first look at the hard encoding, if you were to try to describe Gordon Ryan to a machine, how many rules are in there, do you think?

2:35:40.700 --> 2:35:50.700
 First off, let me tell you that's one of the most fascinating questions I've ever been asked, and I'm tremendously happy to answer this.

2:35:50.700 --> 2:35:58.700
 How about what we do? This is a massive question you've asked. There's a huge amount of ways this could get very interesting and very confusing.

2:35:58.700 --> 2:36:10.700
 Let's set some ground rules for the discussion. Lex alluded to the idea of man versus machine and chess.

2:36:10.700 --> 2:36:15.700
 I think that's a really good place for us to start the discussion.

2:36:15.700 --> 2:36:24.700
 I'm going to just tell people a little bit about the history of man versus chess to give you guys some background on this.

2:36:24.700 --> 2:36:32.700
 In 1968, there was a party in which a highly ranked, not a world champion, but a highly ranked chess player. His name was Levy.

2:36:32.700 --> 2:36:52.700
 He met a computer engineer at a party and they had a lighthearted bet that in a 10 year time frame, a human chess player would be defeated by a computer.

2:36:52.700 --> 2:37:02.700
 You've got to remember, in 1968, computing power was very, very low. The computers that got America to the moon were actually pretty damn primitive.

2:37:02.700 --> 2:37:08.700
 Your iPhone would kick all of their asses. Computational power was very, very low in those days.

2:37:08.700 --> 2:37:23.700
 Interestingly, the chess player fully believed that no computer could beat him in the 10 year time frame. The computer engineer was very optimistic that he was wrong and in fact, 10 years, the computer would win.

2:37:23.700 --> 2:37:34.700
 10 years later, they had a competition and the human won decisively in fact. Computational power simply hadn't risen to that level yet.

2:37:34.700 --> 2:37:43.700
 Through the 1980s, computational power increased, but not sufficient to get to championship level.

2:37:43.700 --> 2:37:53.700
 There were computer programs in the 1980s which were competitive with good solid chess players, but not world beaters.

2:37:53.700 --> 2:38:10.700
 Understand right from the start that there's a fundamental problem here. The number of options that the two players in a chess board can run through is astronomically high.

2:38:10.700 --> 2:38:13.700
 There are 64 squares on a chess board.

2:38:13.700 --> 2:38:33.700
 The number of possible options that could play out on a chess board, and this is a truly shocking thing for you to think about, the number of possible options is higher than the number of atoms in the known universe.

2:38:33.700 --> 2:38:42.700
 Think about that for a second in terms of complexity. The number of atoms on this table is massive.

2:38:42.700 --> 2:38:47.700
 That is an unbelievably large number.

2:38:47.700 --> 2:38:59.700
 We're talking about a situation where if a computer had to go through all the options at the onset of a match, they would have to run numbers greater than the number of atoms in the known universe.

2:38:59.700 --> 2:39:11.700
 The number of galaxies in our universe is vast. It's measured in the billions. The number of atoms, that's just a number so mind blowing it's impossible.

2:39:11.700 --> 2:39:18.700
 No computer is ever going to be able to work with those kinds of numbers.

2:39:18.700 --> 2:39:25.700
 Future generations of quantum computers could work with those kind of numbers. That's the fundamental problem.

2:39:25.700 --> 2:39:37.700
 The number of options in a chess match is just so astronomically large that no computer could ever figure out all the available options and make decisions at a given time frame.

2:39:37.700 --> 2:39:45.700
 That's the fundamental problem. As Lex correctly pointed out, the way you get around this is by the use of heuristics.

2:39:45.700 --> 2:39:54.700
 These are rules of thumb which give general guidelines to action. For example, in jiu jitsu, I could give you a general rule of thumb.

2:39:54.700 --> 2:40:03.700
 Don't turn your back on your opponent. That's a solid piece of advice. There are obviously some exceptions to that rule, but it's a good solid piece of advice to give a beginner.

2:40:03.700 --> 2:40:12.700
 The moment you give that heuristic rule, you rule out a lot of options. You've already told someone, don't turn your back. Don't turn your back on someone.

2:40:12.700 --> 2:40:21.700
 A lot of possibilities have just been turned away right there. You've cut the number of options in half right there just by giving one heuristic rule.

2:40:21.700 --> 2:40:35.700
 If you were decent at chess, not great, but decent and you knew enough to give, say, 10 heuristic rules, you could chop that initially vast number of options down by a vast amount.

2:40:35.700 --> 2:40:46.700
 And now you're starting to get to a point where if a computer had sufficient computational power, it could start getting through the number of options in that acceptable time frame.

2:40:46.700 --> 2:40:57.700
 So that's the general pattern of the development. Now things started getting very interesting in the mid 1990s with IBM's computer Deep Blue.

2:40:57.700 --> 2:41:08.700
 There was a great chess champion of the late 1980s and early 1990s through the 1990s called Gary Kasparov, who had been more or less undefeated for a decade.

2:41:08.700 --> 2:41:12.700
 In 1996, he took on IBM's computer Deep Blue.

2:41:12.700 --> 2:41:17.700
 Just to correct the record, he was undefeated.

2:41:17.700 --> 2:41:22.700
 I follow that as Russian. They get very nationalistic about their chess. Be careful of these guys.

2:41:22.700 --> 2:41:28.700
 Deep Blue lost the first confrontation, I believe, in 1996. It was competitive, but lost.

2:41:28.700 --> 2:41:43.700
 Then in 1997, Deep Blue won and it wasn't a complete walkover. Kasparov, I believe, won one of the matches, but Deep Blue unequivocally won the confrontation.

2:41:43.700 --> 2:41:51.700
 And it was seen as like this watershed moment where a computer beat the best human chess player on the planet and that was it.

2:41:51.700 --> 2:41:54.700
 There's no coming back from that.

2:41:54.700 --> 2:42:06.700
 I think it would be remembered as one of the biggest moments in computing history is really when the first time a machine beat a human and a thing that humans really care about in the domain of intellectual pursuits.

2:42:06.700 --> 2:42:10.700
 Yeah. It was a powerful, powerful moment.

2:42:10.700 --> 2:42:17.700
 Now, not only was that a powerful moment, but things started getting truly interesting from that moment forward.

2:42:17.700 --> 2:42:25.700
 They were having different areas of development.

2:42:25.700 --> 2:42:44.700
 The general way in which the progress is made from those early starts in 1968, all the way through to Deep Blue's victory, was of the use of heuristic rules that brought down the number of potential options to a manageable level.

2:42:44.700 --> 2:42:54.700
 When computer power increased, then it could make faster and faster and wiser and wiser decisions and make the matter rate which no human, even the best human could keep up with.

2:42:54.700 --> 2:43:00.700
 So that was the general way in which the debate went.

2:43:00.700 --> 2:43:12.700
 But things got more interesting after this with the advent of computers that, as you pointed out, make use of so called machine learning.

2:43:12.700 --> 2:43:40.700
 There were a company put out a program, AlphaZero, which can look at the basic rule structures of chess and then ultimately play itself in trial games and make trial and error assessment of what are good and bad strategies so that with no human intervention, a computer could start doing remarkable things.

2:43:40.700 --> 2:44:01.700
 Not only did this company create AlphaZero, and there were some other ones too, that they fought not only in chess, but in the much more complex Asian game of Go, which has far more potential options than chess does by a very significant margin.

2:44:01.700 --> 2:44:10.700
 These machine learning programs not only easily defeat any human in chess, but in Go as well.

2:44:10.700 --> 2:44:14.700
 And what's truly remarkable is they weren't just beating them.

2:44:14.700 --> 2:44:34.700
 When AlphaZero took on a rival chess program, which by itself is already superior to any human, it only required four hours, starting from learning the rules of chess to figuring out how to beat the second most powerful chess program in the world.

2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:36.700
 That's insane.

2:44:36.700 --> 2:44:47.700
 That's literally like taking a human, telling the rules of chess, they play some games with themselves for four hours and they go out and beat Gary Kasparov.

2:44:47.700 --> 2:44:55.700
 To me, this is a truly exciting development, far beyond even what Deep Blue did.

2:44:55.700 --> 2:44:59.700
 I like how you said exciting, not terrifying, because I agree with you on the exciting.

2:44:59.700 --> 2:45:09.700
 Now, things also get exciting in a different direction. There is another possibility which few people foresaw after the Deep Blue episode.

2:45:09.700 --> 2:45:26.700
 This is where a new form of chess started to emerge, sometimes called cyborg chess or centaur chess, where humans have moderate chess level playing ability, not world champions, just decent, but not great.

2:45:26.700 --> 2:45:33.700
 I guess you might say like purple belts and jiu jitsu, allied themselves with computers.

2:45:33.700 --> 2:45:38.700
 So the humans and computers worked as a cyborg team.

2:45:38.700 --> 2:45:46.700
 The humans supplied the heuristic insight. The computers supplied the computational power.

2:45:46.700 --> 2:45:55.700
 And fascinatingly, they proved to be superior to both the best humans and the best chess programs.

2:45:55.700 --> 2:46:20.700
 The united force of human insight with heuristics, with computers ability to go through numbers in far more rapid form than any human could ever hope to do, proved to be one of the strongest combinations and enabled that pairing of human and computer to overwhelm both the best single human and the best single computer.

2:46:20.700 --> 2:46:25.700
 That adds a whole new level of fascination to this topic.

2:46:25.700 --> 2:46:42.700
 So to wind things up here, we've got this fascinating initial question from Lex, the idea of could there be a computer inside a robot which doesn't have any special physical properties.

2:46:42.700 --> 2:46:50.700
 This is mind versus mind because the bodies negate each other. The robot is the same body as Gordon Ryan. This is a thought experiment.

2:46:50.700 --> 2:46:58.700
 What would it take to create a mind that would defeat the mind of Gordon Ryan?

2:46:58.700 --> 2:47:13.700
 Based on the chess example, it would appear that this is entirely feasible at some point in the future. And in fact, I would go further and say it's actually quite likely based on what we've seen from the example of chess.

2:47:13.700 --> 2:47:28.700
 The rate of progress in AI in the last 20 years is what has dwarfed anything from the previous 50 years. And the rate continues to increase.

2:47:28.700 --> 2:47:46.700
 We're talking now at a level with machine learning, defeating world champions in chess and go in four hours. Just from starting from the rules of the sport, this is going to be difficult for humans to keep up with.

2:47:46.700 --> 2:48:04.700
 Now, in humans favor, could we take Gordon Ryan and put a chip inside his brain that created the same cyborg effect as we saw in Centaur chess and cyborg chess and then take Gordon Ryan to a new level where suddenly his computational powers were massively increased.

2:48:04.700 --> 2:48:12.700
 He still has his heuristic insight, but he has vastly augmented computational powers. That's the interesting battle.

2:48:12.700 --> 2:48:30.700
 You asked a great question. Let me give you my initial push for an answer would be that if it's just Gordon Ryan versus your robot technology in 10 years, I would say with machine learning, I'd say you guys win every time.

2:48:30.700 --> 2:48:45.700
 But if it is cyborg, Gordon Ryan, where he's part part Gordon Ryan with heuristics and part machine, then that's and now that's right. Throw the question back at you, young man.

2:48:45.700 --> 2:48:49.700
 What do you think? Well, it's fascinating to hear your answer.

2:48:49.700 --> 2:49:08.700
 That's very interesting because there's a lot of different ways you can build a cyborg Gordon Ryan. So one is there's the neural link way, which is basically say doing what you're suggesting, which is expanding the computational capabilities of Gordon Ryan's brain,

2:49:08.700 --> 2:49:25.700
 like directly being able to communicate between a computer and the brain. So most of you preserve most of what there is in the human body, including the nervous system and the computing system we currently have that's biological and expanding it with the computer.

2:49:25.700 --> 2:49:41.700
 There's also on the cyber chess front, the like Magnus Carlson, the current world champion in chess, he studies Alpha zero games like that. It's not a regular thing for high level grandmasters.

2:49:41.700 --> 2:49:59.700
 From what I understand, almost every chess master now studies computer games for inspiration like that. Just as great chess players from the past used to go back into old leather bound books of previous grandmasters and study games and books.

2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:06.700
 Nowadays, most people, when they want to study the most perfect games, they actually study programs like Alpha zero.

2:50:06.700 --> 2:50:17.700
 Yeah. And it's not just for inspiration. It's education. It's I mean, it's literally part of their training regimen. This isn't like a fun side thing. This is the main way to get better.

2:50:17.700 --> 2:50:31.700
 So, so there's a certain element there where even our human brains can be trained by observing the partial explorations of an AI systems in the space of grappling.

2:50:31.700 --> 2:50:45.700
 That could be actually in simulation. It doesn't have to be in the physical world. It could be in, if we construct sufficiently good biomechanical models of human beings, machines can learn how they grapple.

2:50:45.700 --> 2:50:57.700
 There's quite a bit of that already. Open AI has the system of they're like sumo wrestlers with some basic goals of pushing each other off of a platform.

2:50:57.700 --> 2:51:07.700
 And you know nothing from them. You don't even know. So you have a basic model of a bipedal system. It doesn't even know in the beginning how to stand up. It just falls.

2:51:07.700 --> 2:51:19.700
 Right. So it has to learn how to get up and they do that through self play. They've they learn how to get up. They learn how to move enough to achieve the final goal, which is to push your opponent off of the thing.

2:51:19.700 --> 2:51:20.700
 Fascinating.

2:51:20.700 --> 2:51:29.700
 So they've learned that now open AI is not those folks are currently not that interested in the grappling world. So they kind of stop there.

2:51:29.700 --> 2:51:38.700
 But it's very possible in simulation to then develop ideas. In fact, this is something I should probably do.

2:51:38.700 --> 2:51:57.700
 It's a pretty natural to do it easy is ideas of control and submission and all all the, you know, you add the ability to, I don't know how to put it nicely, but to to choke your opponent and to break their body parts off,

2:51:57.700 --> 2:52:08.700
 which is just so is add that in. And what kind of ideas will come up with is very fascinating. I actually don't know until this conversation. I don't know why I never even thought about that.

2:52:08.700 --> 2:52:18.700
 I've been very obsessed with just like walking and and running and all those kinds of things like evolving different strategies for when you have a bunch of.

2:52:18.700 --> 2:52:34.700
 So one difficult thing for robots is when you have uneven terrain and there's uncertainty about the terrain is how to keep walking or when, when there's a bunch of things being thrown at you, all that kind of stuff and you learn through self play how to be able to navigate those

2:52:34.700 --> 2:52:43.700
 uncertain environments when there's a lot of weird objects and all those kinds of things. There's no reason why you can't just do that with with submissions and so on in simulation.

2:52:43.700 --> 2:52:58.700
 It's actually fascinating. But once we might be surprised by the kind of strategies in simulation, these AI systems will develop and that might make a much better Gordon Ryan and much better John Donahar.

2:52:58.700 --> 2:53:20.700
 In way in asking the Dean Lister question of like, why are we only using? Why are we not doing X? But on the actual sort of grappling event in the physical space, I've been very surprised and a little bit disappointed by how difficult it's to build

2:53:20.700 --> 2:53:37.700
 a system that's able to have the body of Gordon Ryan or a human being actually, which means it's not just the biomechanics, which is very difficult to do, but also all of the senses that are involved.

2:53:37.700 --> 2:53:50.700
 To be able to perceive the world as richly, to be able to, there's something called soft robotics, which is incredibly difficult to do through touch, understand the hardness of things.

2:53:50.700 --> 2:53:59.700
 We don't understand as human beings just how much we're able to touch to experience the world and to manipulate the world.

2:53:59.700 --> 2:54:09.700
 And the process of picking up a cup is very similar to the process of grappling, all the feeling that you do, all the leverage that you're applying.

2:54:09.700 --> 2:54:17.700
 There is so many degrees of freedom in both the, in the interactive sense, in the sensing and the applying, sensing and applying.

2:54:17.700 --> 2:54:30.700
 And that through so much of your body, there's just going to be very difficult to build a system that's able to experience the world and act onto the world as richly as we humans can.

2:54:30.700 --> 2:54:42.700
 Yeah, if picking up a cup is a seemingly insurmountable challenge, then taking someone down, controlling them, getting past their legs, that's going to be one hell of a project.

2:54:42.700 --> 2:54:52.700
 Exactly. I mean, there could be shortcuts, but I mean, currently that's the field called robotic manipulation, which is picking up objects.

2:54:52.700 --> 2:54:59.700
 Usually they have like a ball and a triangular object, and your whole task is to like pick it up and move it around.

2:54:59.700 --> 2:55:08.700
 Generalizing that to the human body is harder, but perhaps not as hard as we might think.

2:55:08.700 --> 2:55:12.700
 The question is, how do you construct experiments where you can do that safely?

2:55:12.700 --> 2:55:21.700
 In chess, that's very easy, but here it's very, very problematic.

2:55:21.700 --> 2:55:28.700
 I guess you could just have a robot versus robot teamed up with each other and then they learn and then they go out to take on a human opponent.

2:55:28.700 --> 2:55:34.700
 Yes, exactly. So you have two physical robots that interact with each other.

2:55:34.700 --> 2:55:42.700
 Everything you've said so far suggests that many of the problems these tactical elements, they're easy tasks for humans.

2:55:42.700 --> 2:55:55.700
 So which becomes more powerful more quickly? Robots that are taught to think like humans or humans that are given the computational power of computers and robots themselves.

2:55:55.700 --> 2:56:02.700
 Which wins first, a cyborg Gordon Ryan or an artificial robot Gordon Ryan?

2:56:02.700 --> 2:56:09.700
 Really, really strong question, and I think by far the cyborg Gordon Ryan.

2:56:09.700 --> 2:56:16.700
 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking here. The problems you're talking about with regards to robots, those are deep problems.

2:56:16.700 --> 2:56:24.700
 If picking up a cup is problematic, it's going to be damn difficult, but to a human, that two year old can do that.

2:56:24.700 --> 2:56:34.700
 You're highlighting a very important difference is human beings have something called common sense that we don't know how to build into computers currently.

2:56:34.700 --> 2:56:40.700
 That's what picking up the cup is. It's some basic rules about the way this world works.

2:56:40.700 --> 2:56:45.700
 We're able to, this is when we're children and we'll crawl around and pick up.

2:56:45.700 --> 2:56:53.700
 What humans don't have that machines have is incredible computational power and access to infinite knowledge.

2:56:53.700 --> 2:57:07.700
 Computers can do that. If you have a Gordon Ryan with the infinite knowledge and compute power, that's just going to, because we know how to do that, that's going to blow out of the water.

2:57:07.700 --> 2:57:25.700
 Has there been any update on the phenomenon of cyborg or centaur chess? There was some debate as to whether or not cyborg chess teams could stay competitive with the latest machine learning.

2:57:25.700 --> 2:57:27.700
 Has there been any update on that?

2:57:27.700 --> 2:57:34.700
 Yeah, I believe at this point, machines dominate over the machine human pairs.

2:57:34.700 --> 2:57:41.700
 With the human pairs, when they first came out, they were good chess players, but not great chess players.

2:57:41.700 --> 2:57:51.700
 Does it make any difference if you have, say, Gary Kasparov and a computer working unison versus Joe Blow from?

2:57:51.700 --> 2:57:56.700
 It does make a huge difference, but yeah, both are destroyed by machines at this point.

2:57:56.700 --> 2:57:58.700
 And it's not even competitive now?

2:57:58.700 --> 2:57:59.700
 No, it's not competitive.

2:57:59.700 --> 2:58:12.700
 But they also lost interest in this kind of idea. So I think there's still competitions between human machine pairs versus human machine pairs, almost like to see how the two work together.

2:58:12.700 --> 2:58:16.700
 But in terms of machine versus human machine pair, machines still dominate.

2:58:16.700 --> 2:58:17.700
 Interesting.

2:58:17.700 --> 2:58:31.700
 And now we've retrieved back as human beings caring mostly about human versus human competitions, which is probably what the future will look like. It's very interesting to think, but that in chess happened really quickly.

2:58:31.700 --> 2:58:40.700
 It won't happen, and it wasn't so painful in chess because we care about chess, but it's not so fundamental to human society.

2:58:40.700 --> 2:58:59.700
 When you started talking about cyborg Gordon Ryans, which really beyond grappling is referring to robots operating in physical space or human robot hybrids operating in physical space, you're talking about our society is now full of cyborgs.

2:58:59.700 --> 2:59:00.700
 Yes.

2:59:00.700 --> 2:59:10.700
 And that transition might be very painful or transformative in a way we can't even predict.

2:59:10.700 --> 2:59:20.700
 And that very much has applications, as both China and US now have legalized, is autonomous weapons systems.

2:59:20.700 --> 2:59:24.700
 So use of these kinds of systems in military applications.

2:59:24.700 --> 2:59:37.700
 So it used to be, there've been a big call in the AI community to ban autonomous weapons. So the use of artificial intelligence in war, just like bio weapons are banned internationally.

2:59:37.700 --> 2:59:46.700
 So you're not allowed to use bio weapons in war. And actually most people, even terrorists, have kind of agreed on this ban.

2:59:46.700 --> 2:59:56.700
 There's been a quiet agreement, like we're not going to be doing this because everybody's going to get really pissed off with autonomous weapons systems.

2:59:56.700 --> 3:00:02.700
 That's not been the case. China has said that they're going to be using AI in their military.

3:00:02.700 --> 3:00:26.700
 And the US in 2021 just released a report saying that they're going to add increasing amounts of artificial intelligence into our military systems, into drones, into just everything that's doing any kind of both strategic and actual bombing and defense systems.

3:00:26.700 --> 3:00:33.700
 I presume a drone army would easily defeat a human army in the near future.

3:00:33.700 --> 3:00:42.700
 I mean, think about, just off the top of my head, just think about the implication of kamikaze drones versus a naval fleet.

3:00:42.700 --> 3:00:47.700
 I mean, kamikazes with humans in World War II did terrible damage to our navy.

3:00:47.700 --> 3:00:55.700
 Imagine swarms of mechanical kamikazes, which have no fear, no remorse.

3:00:55.700 --> 3:00:59.700
 But it's very inefficient. Kamikaze is very inefficient.

3:00:59.700 --> 3:01:05.700
 You want to be very like wars. It's the same discussion to Jiu Jitsu, right?

3:01:05.700 --> 3:01:13.700
 You want to be, you want to create an asymmetry of power and you want to be efficient in the way you deliver that power.

3:01:13.700 --> 3:01:16.700
 It actually goes back to the picking up a cup.

3:01:16.700 --> 3:01:25.700
 Currently, a lot of things we do in war, like most of the drones that you hear about, they're not autonomous, not most, all.

3:01:25.700 --> 3:01:26.700
 They're usually piloted by humans.

3:01:26.700 --> 3:01:29.700
 They're piloted remotely by humans.

3:01:29.700 --> 3:01:42.700
 And humans are really good at this kind of what's necessary to deliver the most damage, targeted damage, effective as part of the largest strategy you have about bombing the area or all that kind of stuff.

3:01:42.700 --> 3:01:44.700
 I don't know how difficult that is to automate.

3:01:44.700 --> 3:01:50.700
 I think the biggest concern, I actually have a sense that it's very difficult to automate.

3:01:50.700 --> 3:02:00.700
 The biggest concern is almost like an incompetent application of this and consequences that are not anticipated.

3:02:00.700 --> 3:02:18.700
 So you have a drone army where you say, we want to target, you give it power to target a particular terrorist and then there's some bug in the system that has, for example, has a large uncertainty about the location of that terrorist.

3:02:18.700 --> 3:02:21.700
 And so it decides to bomb an entire city.

3:02:21.700 --> 3:02:24.700
 You know, almost like as a bug, a software bug.

3:02:24.700 --> 3:02:35.700
 I'm much more concerned about like bad programming and software engineering than I am about like malevolent AI systems that destroy the world.

3:02:35.700 --> 3:02:39.700
 So the more we rely on automation, this is the lesson in human history.

3:02:39.700 --> 3:02:53.700
 The more we give to AI, to software, to robotic systems, the more we forget how to supervise and oversee some of the edge cases, all the weird ways that things go wrong.

3:02:53.700 --> 3:03:04.700
 And then the more stupid software bugs can lead to huge damage, like, you know, even like nuclear explosions, those kinds of things.

3:03:04.700 --> 3:03:20.700
 If we add AI into the launch systems for nuclear weapons, for example, I think human history teaches us that software bugs is what will lead to World War Three.

3:03:20.700 --> 3:03:25.700
 Not malevolent AI or human beings.

3:03:25.700 --> 3:03:26.700
 Interesting.

3:03:26.700 --> 3:03:30.700
 By the way, I deeply appreciate how knowledgeable you are about the history of artificial intelligence.

3:03:30.700 --> 3:03:31.700
 That was awesome.

3:03:31.700 --> 3:03:33.700
 Oh, no, it's fascinating stuff.

3:03:33.700 --> 3:03:42.700
 You know, I remember reading when I was a child about, you know, Turing tests and things like this and visionaries from the 1950s had ideas to see it come this far.

3:03:42.700 --> 3:03:47.700
 It's just fascinating to me.

3:03:47.700 --> 3:03:50.700
 Okay, so what can we as duty players take away from this?

3:03:50.700 --> 3:04:02.700
 We saw that when it comes to computers versus humans in chess tournaments, humans had something truly valuable to give to the computers.

3:04:02.700 --> 3:04:05.700
 That was heuristic rules.

3:04:05.700 --> 3:04:17.700
 In every coaching program that I run, I make an endless quest to search out and find effective heuristic rules.

3:04:17.700 --> 3:04:20.700
 That's the basis of a good training program.

3:04:20.700 --> 3:04:23.700
 Heuristic rules and principles.

3:04:23.700 --> 3:04:38.700
 Give vast informational content, which can rapidly increase your performance on the mat, just as they rapidly increase the performance of chess computers to overcome the human adversaries.

3:04:38.700 --> 3:04:42.700
 The great human weakness is computational power.

3:04:42.700 --> 3:04:50.700
 Most people vastly overestimate their ability to reason and problem solve under stress.

3:04:50.700 --> 3:05:02.700
 In fact, numerous psychological studies have shown that humans can balance a relatively small number of competing options in stressful decision making.

3:05:02.700 --> 3:05:05.700
 But what we do have, what is it?

3:05:05.700 --> 3:05:18.700
 The great and unique human gift is this idea to come up and arrive at heuristic rules and principles, which turn out to be very effective guides to behavior for both human behavior

3:05:18.700 --> 3:05:22.700
 and artificially intelligent behavior.

3:05:22.700 --> 3:05:26.700
 Make that your focus in study.

3:05:26.700 --> 3:05:30.700
 Don't try to remember 10,000 different details on a move.

3:05:30.700 --> 3:05:33.700
 That's human weakness, not human strength.

3:05:33.700 --> 3:05:36.700
 Our strength is heuristics.

3:05:36.700 --> 3:05:43.700
 Make that your focus, not endless computations over 25 details here merged with 27 details here.

3:05:43.700 --> 3:05:46.700
 That's not what humans are good at.

3:05:46.700 --> 3:06:03.700
 The uniquely human strength is arriving at these heuristic rules and principles, which guide our behavior, which provides simplifications, which enable us to take vast amounts of information and carry it down to a few simple rules that effectively guide our behavior.

3:06:03.700 --> 3:06:06.700
 Take that core insight from the discussion that Lex and I just had.

3:06:06.700 --> 3:06:08.700
 It was a complex discussion.

3:06:08.700 --> 3:06:10.700
 We both apologized for going a little bit overboard.

3:06:10.700 --> 3:06:11.700
 That was awesome.

3:06:11.700 --> 3:06:13.700
 Then dragging you into some details there, but take that away from it.

3:06:13.700 --> 3:06:14.700
 I love it.

3:06:14.700 --> 3:06:16.700
 It will make you better at jiu jitsu.

3:06:16.700 --> 3:06:18.700
 Sorry, Lex.

3:06:18.700 --> 3:06:23.700
 That was a really exciting discussion.

3:06:23.700 --> 3:06:29.700
 The depths of knowledge in the dimensions of knowledge you have and interests you have is just fascinating.

3:06:29.700 --> 3:06:36.700
 Is there advice you have for complete beginners for white belts that are starting jiu jitsu?

3:06:36.700 --> 3:06:37.700
 They're listening to this.

3:06:37.700 --> 3:06:38.700
 They haven't done jiu jitsu.

3:06:38.700 --> 3:06:42.700
 I know there's a lot of people who are super curious to start.

3:06:42.700 --> 3:06:45.700
 Is there advice you would give them on their journey?

3:06:45.700 --> 3:06:46.700
 Yeah.

3:06:46.700 --> 3:06:49.700
 I'm just going to talk about just getting better on the mat.

3:06:49.700 --> 3:06:50.700
 Okay.

3:06:50.700 --> 3:06:54.700
 Because there's a thousand other things you can talk about in terms of like morale and persistence,

3:06:54.700 --> 3:06:57.700
 and how often does your training is a thousand things you get?

3:06:57.700 --> 3:06:59.700
 Very top of your girlfriend or boyfriend.

3:06:59.700 --> 3:07:00.700
 That's what I'm saying.

3:07:00.700 --> 3:07:02.700
 Let's put that aside.

3:07:02.700 --> 3:07:05.700
 That's probably the best advice we could give.

3:07:05.700 --> 3:07:07.700
 It goes back to what we said earlier.

3:07:07.700 --> 3:07:11.700
 I always advocate, start your training from the ground up.

3:07:11.700 --> 3:07:12.700
 Okay.

3:07:12.700 --> 3:07:21.700
 Your first sessions in jiu jitsu, you're going to find to your horror that everyone gets on top of you and you can't get out.

3:07:21.700 --> 3:07:28.700
 And it's a dispiriting, crushing kind of feeling that you just have no skills and you have no prospects in the sport.

3:07:28.700 --> 3:07:34.700
 So your first skill is the skill of being able to free yourself from positional pins.

3:07:34.700 --> 3:07:38.700
 Most of the escapes in jiu jitsu go to guard position.

3:07:38.700 --> 3:07:46.700
 And so once you get someone in your guard, they're going to be looking to pass your guard and get back into those positional pins that you just escaped from.

3:07:46.700 --> 3:07:49.700
 And that's just as crushing as getting pinned.

3:07:49.700 --> 3:07:53.700
 You feel like every time you try to hold someone in guard, they just effortlessly pass you by.

3:07:53.700 --> 3:07:59.700
 So your first two skills, you've got about a get out of any pin and you've got about a hold someone in your guard.

3:07:59.700 --> 3:08:03.700
 So pin escapes and guard retention are your first two skills.

3:08:03.700 --> 3:08:13.700
 I generally advocate the idea of learning to fight from your back first and then learning to fight from on top second.

3:08:13.700 --> 3:08:14.700
 Why?

3:08:14.700 --> 3:08:21.700
 Because the brute fact is when you first start off, you just don't have enough skills to hold top position or gain top position through a takedown.

3:08:21.700 --> 3:08:25.700
 So inevitably you're going to end up underneath people for most of your training time.

3:08:25.700 --> 3:08:29.700
 Your training should reflect that in the early days as a white belt.

3:08:29.700 --> 3:08:31.700
 Start with the first two skills you need.

3:08:31.700 --> 3:08:33.700
 They're not the most exciting.

3:08:33.700 --> 3:08:36.700
 They're not sexy skills that are going to make you look like a stud in the training room,

3:08:36.700 --> 3:08:42.700
 but they're going to keep your life long enough to learn those sexy skills in the future that will make you look like a stud.

3:08:42.700 --> 3:08:48.700
 Start with pin escapes, go to guard retention and focus heavily on those two.

3:08:48.700 --> 3:08:52.700
 When you start to get into offense, start with bottom position.

3:08:52.700 --> 3:08:59.700
 So there's a clear continuity between your pin escapes, your guard retention, and then your guard itself.

3:08:59.700 --> 3:09:02.700
 You've got different options with guard.

3:09:02.700 --> 3:09:04.700
 Some of you are going to like close guard.

3:09:04.700 --> 3:09:07.700
 Some of you are going to like variations of open guard.

3:09:07.700 --> 3:09:09.700
 Some of you are going to like to be seated.

3:09:09.700 --> 3:09:10.700
 Some of you are going to like to be supine.

3:09:10.700 --> 3:09:12.700
 Some of you are going to like half guard.

3:09:12.700 --> 3:09:18.700
 As a general rule, this is a heavy generalization, but I'm going to give it to you.

3:09:18.700 --> 3:09:23.700
 In my experience, most people benefit the most by starting with half guard first.

3:09:23.700 --> 3:09:29.700
 I know that traditionally Jiu Jitsu has been taught close guard first and then all the other guards come after that.

3:09:29.700 --> 3:09:37.700
 I'm a big believer in the idea of start with pin escapes, then go to guard retention and then start with half guard bottom.

3:09:37.700 --> 3:09:45.700
 That way you get a nice continuity between your first three skills and you make good progress over those first critical six months in Jiu Jitsu.

3:09:45.700 --> 3:09:49.700
 What does it take to get a black belt in Jiu Jitsu?

3:09:49.700 --> 3:09:50.700
 Very little.

3:09:50.700 --> 3:09:57.700
 Very little to show up, pay your fees.

3:09:57.700 --> 3:09:59.700
 Don't set your goals low.

3:09:59.700 --> 3:10:01.700
 Don't even ask yourself that question.

3:10:01.700 --> 3:10:03.700
 No one cares if you've got a black belt.

3:10:03.700 --> 3:10:05.700
 The only thing that counts is the skills you have.

3:10:05.700 --> 3:10:08.700
 I know plenty of black belts that suck.

3:10:08.700 --> 3:10:11.700
 There's a lot of them out there.

3:10:11.700 --> 3:10:15.700
 Don't lower your standards by saying, I want to get a black belt.

3:10:15.700 --> 3:10:20.700
 Ask yourself something much more important, how good do I want to be?

3:10:20.700 --> 3:10:21.700
 You want to be damn good, right?

3:10:21.700 --> 3:10:24.700
 You want to do something in this time and you want to be the best you can.

3:10:24.700 --> 3:10:27.700
 Wearing a belt around your waist doesn't guarantee that.

3:10:27.700 --> 3:10:30.700
 Build skills, focus on that.

3:10:30.700 --> 3:10:39.700
 Let me ask you about the fourth thing in facet face of Jiu Jitsu, which is self defense.

3:10:39.700 --> 3:10:41.700
 Let's say the bigger things.

3:10:41.700 --> 3:10:44.700
 I don't know why it's called self defense.

3:10:44.700 --> 3:10:46.700
 Let's call it street fighting.

3:10:46.700 --> 3:10:48.700
 Let's call it fighting.

3:10:48.700 --> 3:10:51.700
 Maybe you can contest us that terminology.

3:10:51.700 --> 3:10:53.700
 How about non sport fighting?

3:10:53.700 --> 3:10:54.700
 Non sport fighting.

3:10:54.700 --> 3:10:55.700
 It's funny, street fighting.

3:10:55.700 --> 3:10:57.700
 What happens if you go out on a playground and you're fighting on grass?

3:10:57.700 --> 3:10:59.700
 Because they're no longer street fighting.

3:10:59.700 --> 3:11:00.700
 It's like tennis.

3:11:00.700 --> 3:11:03.700
 You have like wimbled in like grass courts.

3:11:03.700 --> 3:11:05.700
 It's a whole other thing.

3:11:05.700 --> 3:11:10.700
 What do you think is the best martial art for street fighting?

3:11:10.700 --> 3:11:21.700
 What is the best set of, we talked about advice for white bows to advance in grappling in Jiu Jitsu?

3:11:21.700 --> 3:11:27.700
 What is the set of techniques, maybe martial art that is best for street fighting?

3:11:27.700 --> 3:11:28.700
 Okay.

3:11:28.700 --> 3:11:37.700
 Again, you're asking some truly fascinating questions here.

3:11:37.700 --> 3:11:44.700
 The way this gets framed as a question is often condemns you to bad answers from the start.

3:11:44.700 --> 3:11:53.700
 This is, as a questioner, I'm trying to achieve asymmetry of power and I'm winning.

3:11:53.700 --> 3:11:56.700
 Put you in a bad position.

3:11:56.700 --> 3:12:01.700
 Don't worry so much about, people are always going to say, you know, is this martial art better or is this martial art better?

3:12:01.700 --> 3:12:09.700
 The truth is, there's only one way to say this.

3:12:09.700 --> 3:12:15.700
 Combat sports are your best option for self defense.

3:12:15.700 --> 3:12:20.700
 There are many martial arts and there is a rough divide between the two.

3:12:20.700 --> 3:12:45.700
 Those that fall into combat sports and those that fall into non sporting martial arts where there's no competitive live sparring element where most of the knowledge is limited to theoretical knowledge reinforced by passive drilling.

3:12:45.700 --> 3:12:57.700
 If you have a choice between a combat sport versus a non sporting art based around theoretical knowledge and passive drilling, go with a combat sport.

3:12:57.700 --> 3:13:10.700
 Nothing will prepare you for the intensity of a genuine altercation better than combat sports.

3:13:10.700 --> 3:13:29.700
 Many people, as I say, these words are probably horrified to hear me say this and immediately going to rebut and say, no, combat sports is exactly the wrong thing for you to do because they have safety rules, et cetera, et cetera, which would easily be exploited in a real fight.

3:13:29.700 --> 3:13:35.700
 And if I fought a world championship box, I would just poke them in the eye or kick them in the groin, et cetera, et cetera.

3:13:35.700 --> 3:13:37.700
 You've heard these arguments a thousand times.

3:13:37.700 --> 3:14:00.700
 Yes, there is some validity to these things, but as a general rule, if you ask me to bet in any form of street fight, call it what you want between a combat sport adherent versus someone who simply trains with drills and talks in terms of theories of what they would do in a fight.

3:14:00.700 --> 3:14:05.700
 I'm going to go with the combat sport guy every single time.

3:14:05.700 --> 3:14:14.700
 Now, having said that, combat sports need to be modified for the use of self defense street fighting.

3:14:14.700 --> 3:14:15.700
 We haven't agreed on it to him yet.

3:14:15.700 --> 3:14:18.700
 We'll figure it out later.

3:14:18.700 --> 3:14:21.700
 What does this modification consist of?

3:14:21.700 --> 3:14:23.700
 Well, some of it is technical.

3:14:23.700 --> 3:14:38.700
 For example, a boxer in a street fight now has to punch without wrapped or gloved hands. That's problematic. Your hands are not really designed for heavy extended use of clubbing hard objects.

3:14:38.700 --> 3:14:41.700
 There's a very high likelihood of breaking your hands.

3:14:41.700 --> 3:14:56.700
 Mike Tyson was one of the finest punches that ever lived, but in one of his more famous street fights against Mitch Green in the late 1980s, he broke his hand with one punch that he threw his opponent, hit the wrong part of the head and broke his hand.

3:14:56.700 --> 3:14:58.700
 He was one of the most gifted punches of all time.

3:14:58.700 --> 3:15:06.700
 If he can do it, you'll certainly have trouble protecting your hands when you go to throw blows.

3:15:06.700 --> 3:15:21.700
 Nonetheless, this is easily modified and so a boxer can throw with open hands or with elbows and so just a small modification and technique can overcome that problem.

3:15:21.700 --> 3:15:50.700
 So what you'll find is that the general physical, mental conditioning and skill development that comes from combat sports allied with technical modifications and then the most important of all, tactical modifications will provide your best hope in altercations outside of sports in the street or wherever you find yourself.

3:15:50.700 --> 3:16:11.700
 The least effective approaches to self defense that I have observed in my life have been those where, as I said, people talked theory, drilled on passive opponents, and generally had no engagement in live competition or sparring in their training programs.

3:16:11.700 --> 3:16:29.700
 The most effective by a landslide were those that put a heavy emphasis on live sparring and sporting competition modified both technically and tactically for the circumstances in which they found themselves.

3:16:29.700 --> 3:16:42.700
 People talk, for example, about how, you know, and with some validity that weapons will change everything in a street fight. There's absolute truth to that. But this extends into weapons as well.

3:16:42.700 --> 3:17:00.700
 Okay, the most effective forms of knife fighting that you'll see will be those who come from a background in fencing because it has sparring and a competitive sport aspect to it. But would pure fencing be the appropriate thing? Of course not. You'd have to modify it.

3:17:00.700 --> 3:17:09.700
 But the reflexes, endurance, physical mobility that you gain from the sport of fencing could easily be modified to blade craft in a fight situation.

3:17:09.700 --> 3:17:22.700
 What you want to look for with regards street and self defense is not, okay, which style should I choose? Should I choose Taekwondo? Should I choose karate? Should I choose this variation of kung fu? No.

3:17:22.700 --> 3:17:26.700
 Focus on the most important thing. Does it have a sport aspect to it?

3:17:26.700 --> 3:17:44.700
 Then once you've made sufficient progress in the sport aspect of that martial art, start asking yourself, what are the requisite modifications and technique and tactics that I have to use or to input to make it effective for street situations? That's always the advice that I give.

3:17:44.700 --> 3:17:56.700
 Let me zoom in on a very particular aspect of street fighting where, without due respect, I disagree with Mr. Joe Rogan and George St. Pierron, which is the suit and tie situation.

3:17:56.700 --> 3:18:12.700
 Now to criticize GSB, yeah, yeah, he's very accomplished and everything, but to criticize him for a bit, he made claims about how dangerous the tie is in a street fighting situation without ever having used it in a fighting situation.

3:18:12.700 --> 3:18:32.700
 So he made sort of broad proclamations without understanding the fundamentals. So I thought I would go to somebody who thinks in systems. What do you think? Is it dangerous to wear a tie or not in a grappling situation versus all the other weapons?

3:18:32.700 --> 3:18:37.700
 We would do it in a street fight, yeah. We'd buy the strange to wear a tie in a grappling competition.

3:18:37.700 --> 3:18:52.700
 It would be. Yes, in a street fight situation. Joe Rogan thinks it is like the most dangerous, it becomes your weakest point if you wear a tie because it's very easy to choke.

3:18:52.700 --> 3:19:02.700
 George St. Pierron seemed to have agreed with that. Also, George added that you can grab the tie and pull the person down to a knee.

3:19:02.700 --> 3:19:11.700
 Yeah, this is the go to. Joe Rogan will go for the choke. George St. Pierron will go for the tie to the knee, which I was saying is ridiculous. So what do you think?

3:19:11.700 --> 3:19:25.700
 Okay, first up, I actually can speak with experience on this because I worked as a bouncer for over a decade and most of the clubs I worked at did not require a suit and tie, but occasionally they did.

3:19:25.700 --> 3:19:29.700
 Okay, let's first differentiate between the kinds of threats when you wear a tie.

3:19:29.700 --> 3:19:41.700
 If you wear a tie, if there is going to be a threat, by far the more important threat is not strangulation. Being strangled by your tie is possible, but it is a poor choice.

3:19:41.700 --> 3:19:49.700
 There are many other ways to strangle people that are far more efficient. If I strangle with you by your tie, I'm literally in front of you.

3:19:49.700 --> 3:19:59.700
 That means as I go to apply the stranglehold, I can easily be eye gouged etc. If you're going to strangle people in the street, do it from behind and there's just much better ways to do it than that.

3:19:59.700 --> 3:20:01.700
 Hear that, Joe Rogan?

3:20:01.700 --> 3:20:13.700
 With regards to the snap down question, that is more a problem. I always recommend if you are going to work as a bouncer with a tie, wear a clip on tie so it just comes off immediately.

3:20:13.700 --> 3:20:25.700
 If you don't like clip ons, then you can use a bow tie. I used to work for years in hip hop clubs with members of the Nation of Islam security team.

3:20:25.700 --> 3:20:33.700
 They had various factions, but the one I worked with were the X men and they would always wear bow ties, which of course can't be grabbed.

3:20:33.700 --> 3:20:43.700
 Now, the bow tie was a recognizable part of their brand as security guys, so everyone knew that that's what they wore.

3:20:43.700 --> 3:20:53.700
 If I wore a bow tie in a security situation, people would probably think that I was some kind of Nancy boy and want to fight with me, so I couldn't wear one.

3:20:53.700 --> 3:21:09.700
 I would always wear a tie which you should become familiar with, Mr. Freeman. That's the Texas Bolo tie, which is a kind of shoestring tie, which is very, very thin, almost like shoestring and rather short and just has a simple pendant in the middle.

3:21:09.700 --> 3:21:17.700
 This is perfect if you need to wear a tie in a situation where you believe there's a high likelihood of you being grabbed.

3:21:17.700 --> 3:21:23.700
 Because I can't be grabbed. There's nothing to grab. It's literally like string. If you pulled it, it would just slip through your hand.

3:21:23.700 --> 3:21:37.700
 That tie that you're wearing now, that would give me tremendous control of your head and I could easily turn it into a hockey fight situation where your head was being pulled down out of balance and you would have a hard time recovering.

3:21:37.700 --> 3:21:53.700
 So strangulation, not really a problem. Getting pulled down, possible problem. Solutions, clip on tie, bow tie, or if you don't want to look like a Nancy boy, wear a Bolo tie.

3:21:53.700 --> 3:22:05.700
 Beautiful. So you disagree with Joe Rogan and agree with George St. Pierre. I love it. I feel like this is an instruction we put together on street fighting and the tie.

3:22:05.700 --> 3:22:22.700
 Speaking of Joe Rogan, let me ask the following question. He's currently doing a podcast with Gordon and Ryan and probably going to try to convince him and you as he's already been doing to move to Austin.

3:22:22.700 --> 3:22:34.700
 What are the chances of the Donna Hart death squad coming to Austin and opening a school in Austin and making Austin home so I can attend the classes there?

3:22:34.700 --> 3:22:51.700
 I would definitely have to think about that. I do know that I personally love New York, but every single person in the squad despise New York and wanted to leave for a long time.

3:22:51.700 --> 3:22:56.700
 So what was the nature of your love for New York, by the way?

3:22:56.700 --> 3:23:16.700
 It was truly an international city. I'm a big believer in the idea of breadth of experience and if you want, breadth of experience usually requires extensive travel, but training people means you have to be in a fixed location, working according to a schedule.

3:23:16.700 --> 3:23:34.700
 And those two push in different directions. New York was the compromise where everyone from around the world came there so you had breadth of experience of world culture, but at the same time you had a fixed location so you could run a training program that produced world champions.

3:23:34.700 --> 3:23:48.700
 It was the ideal compromise. It was a fascinating thing to teach classes of over 120 people where literally the entire world was represented on the map and go outside and see the same thing.

3:23:48.700 --> 3:24:00.700
 It was truly the world's leading international city. It was like the world's unofficial capital, fascinating place to live.

3:24:00.700 --> 3:24:08.700
 So I loved it, but the squad hated it. For them it was like an expensive, things they never actually lived in Manhattan.

3:24:08.700 --> 3:24:11.700
 They always lived in New Jersey or Long Island, had to commute in.

3:24:11.700 --> 3:24:23.700
 So all they ever saw was the bridges and the tunnels, the expensive daily parking fees. They only saw the worst of New York and despite my pleas for them to move into Manhattan, they never did.

3:24:23.700 --> 3:24:32.700
 And so they hated it because when all you see of New York is the bridges and the tunnels and the parking garage, that's not a pleasant thing.

3:24:32.700 --> 3:24:45.700
 So I understand where they're coming from. So then when COVID broke out, they wanted to move to Puerto Rico and work there.

3:24:45.700 --> 3:24:55.700
 Now Puerto Rico is a beautiful alternative to New York. It's in many ways has many advantages over New York. It's physically beautiful. The people are wonderful.

3:24:55.700 --> 3:25:01.700
 And it's just a wonderful place to spend time.

3:25:01.700 --> 3:25:07.700
 Freedom, low taxes, all those kinds of things that Puerto Rico stands for.

3:25:07.700 --> 3:25:10.700
 Yeah, it's Texas on the other hand. I know everyone in the squad.

3:25:10.700 --> 3:25:13.700
 It's a compromise, right? Texas is a compromise between those two.

3:25:13.700 --> 3:25:19.700
 Actually, I must say that everyone on the squad, myself included, loves Texas.

3:25:19.700 --> 3:25:23.700
 There's no question about that. I know Gordon loves it.

3:25:23.700 --> 3:25:33.700
 Gary, Craig, Nikki, that everyone who comes here just loves Texas. That is incontestable.

3:25:33.700 --> 3:25:40.700
 Of course, in Texas, there's many great cities. Austin has always been one of my favorites.

3:25:40.700 --> 3:25:44.700
 I love Dallas. I love Austin.

3:25:44.700 --> 3:25:52.700
 And it has the advantages of better infrastructure as a place to train.

3:25:52.700 --> 3:26:01.700
 It has a much higher population density so that you could get a larger number of prospective students and form a larger squad.

3:26:01.700 --> 3:26:07.700
 It would definitely be a fantastic place to open up a gym.

3:26:07.700 --> 3:26:13.700
 I couldn't give an answer off the top of my head. It would be a big move if we did make that move.

3:26:13.700 --> 3:26:22.700
 But the basic idea would be very agreeable to everyone on the team. I will say that.

3:26:22.700 --> 3:26:27.700
 Well, I'll just have to call on my Russian connections to threaten the right kind of people.

3:26:27.700 --> 3:26:39.700
 I definitely would love the way you approach training, the way you approach the martial arts is something that I deeply admire as a scholar of these arts.

3:26:39.700 --> 3:26:45.700
 So it would be amazing if you do come here. But either way, it would be amazing to train together.

3:26:45.700 --> 3:26:49.700
 Let me ask a big, ridiculous question.

3:26:49.700 --> 3:26:52.700
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

3:26:52.700 --> 3:27:00.700
 We talked about at the beginning of the conversation about death and the fear of it.

3:27:00.700 --> 3:27:09.700
 The other big question we ask about life is its meaning. Do you think there's a meaning to our existence here on this little spinning ball?

3:27:09.700 --> 3:27:21.700
 You've thrown some powerful questions. That's the most powerful.

3:27:21.700 --> 3:27:30.700
 Most of human existence, the meaning of life was very, very simple. Survival.

3:27:30.700 --> 3:27:43.700
 The only thing that humans cared about was just surviving because it was so damn difficult for the early years of human existence on this earth.

3:27:43.700 --> 3:27:53.700
 If you look at ourselves as biological agents, everything about our body is set up for one mission and that is survival.

3:27:53.700 --> 3:28:02.700
 Every reflex we have, every element of our structure is just built up on the battle to survive.

3:28:02.700 --> 3:28:17.700
 And then humans did something remarkable. They elevated themselves through the use of technology and social structure to the top of the food chain

3:28:17.700 --> 3:28:23.700
 so that they went from extremely vulnerable.

3:28:23.700 --> 3:28:31.700
 If you take a naked human being alone and put them in the Serengeti Plains in Africa, they're in some deep shit.

3:28:31.700 --> 3:28:48.700
 If you look at a human being as a survival organism just by itself, naked, they are among the most feeble at that task in the entire animal kingdom.

3:28:48.700 --> 3:28:59.700
 You compare us with predatory animals. We are weak and soft and easily killed.

3:28:59.700 --> 3:29:13.700
 But if you take that same human and put them in a group and you give them basic technology, steel, a spear, a knife,

3:29:13.700 --> 3:29:20.700
 he goes from the bottom of the food chain to pretty much at the top.

3:29:20.700 --> 3:29:32.700
 And so humanity found itself in a crisis that emerged out of its own success. For most of its history, their only interest was the battle to survive and they did it.

3:29:32.700 --> 3:29:43.700
 I don't know how they did it, but they did it. They got through ice ages, droughts, famines, disease, everything, and they found a way to get to the top of the food chain.

3:29:43.700 --> 3:29:58.700
 And that's where it all got interesting because an organism whose only interest was in survival had for the first time in their history a more or less guaranteed survival.

3:29:58.700 --> 3:30:05.700
 And so the big question now is, now what? We survived. There's no more danger.

3:30:05.700 --> 3:30:17.700
 The average human being finds himself in a world now where there's almost zero danger from predatory animals, where getting a meal is the easiest thing ever.

3:30:17.700 --> 3:30:22.700
 We're getting to and from work. It's not problematic at all.

3:30:22.700 --> 3:30:35.700
 Where the majority of infectious diseases, medical complaints can be resolved in a hospital fairly easily.

3:30:35.700 --> 3:30:41.700
 And so they start casting their mind around, okay, what do I do now?

3:30:41.700 --> 3:30:55.700
 And so the minute mankind's existence became more or less guaranteed, the problem shift from survival to meaning.

3:30:55.700 --> 3:31:09.700
 And we found ourselves grappling with a whole new issue that had never occurred to our ancient forefathers, but which now becomes one of the centerpieces of our modern lives.

3:31:09.700 --> 3:31:17.700
 I mean, when you look at your own life, when you look back, you think, I did a hell of a good job.

3:31:17.700 --> 3:31:22.700
 You know, Hunter Thompson has this line that I often think about.

3:31:22.700 --> 3:31:30.700
 That life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body,

3:31:30.700 --> 3:31:41.700
 but rather to skid in roadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, wow, what a ride.

3:31:41.700 --> 3:31:45.700
 Which is the complete opposite of survival.

3:31:45.700 --> 3:31:55.700
 Well, not complete opposite of survival, but basically embracing danger, embracing risk, going big, just living life to the fullest.

3:31:55.700 --> 3:32:06.700
 So within that context, what would make you proud of a life well lived when you look back, you, John Donahart, looking back at your life?

3:32:06.700 --> 3:32:16.700
 First, I will address that question, but let's first look at why Hunter Thompson could say that, because his life was morally guaranteed and safe.

3:32:16.700 --> 3:32:21.700
 If you look at animals in the animal kingdom, the pattern of their life is very simple.

3:32:21.700 --> 3:32:25.700
 They take the least risk possible to secure their existence.

3:32:25.700 --> 3:32:33.700
 Lions are powerful creatures, but when they go hunting, they typically go for the weakest animals they can kill in order to eat,

3:32:33.700 --> 3:32:37.700
 because they don't want to take the risk of injuring themselves, knowing that if they do, they die.

3:32:37.700 --> 3:32:48.700
 So the brute reality is the only people who can talk about having casual danger in their lives are those whose lives are guaranteed.

3:32:48.700 --> 3:32:53.700
 In a fascinating small tangent, Hunter Thompson took his own life.

3:32:53.700 --> 3:32:57.700
 So that seems like a deeply human thing, suicide.

3:32:57.700 --> 3:32:59.700
 Yes.

3:32:59.700 --> 3:33:02.700
 That's a fascinating question in itself.

3:33:02.700 --> 3:33:10.700
 If you look at the number of suicides per year, it's a shocking, shocking statistic that gets almost no recognition.

3:33:10.700 --> 3:33:18.700
 And yes, uniquely human, you don't... very, very few animals you see killing themselves, because their whole thing is just survival.

3:33:18.700 --> 3:33:24.700
 And that humans paradoxically, when survival is morally guaranteed, are killing themselves in vast numbers.

3:33:24.700 --> 3:33:29.700
 It's usually linked back to the idea of meaning, because it's so hard.

3:33:29.700 --> 3:33:37.700
 It was hard to win the battle for survival, but it's ten times harder to win the battle for meaning.

3:33:37.700 --> 3:33:51.700
 When I think about it, first off, I'll say right from the bat, there's never going to be an agreed upon sense of meaning.

3:33:51.700 --> 3:34:01.700
 As I said, there was one thing that our physical bodies agreed upon, which is hardwired biologically into us, and that's survival.

3:34:01.700 --> 3:34:07.700
 But once we got to a more or less guaranteed survival, then all bets were off.

3:34:07.700 --> 3:34:10.700
 At that point, you just have to start listing your own criteria.

3:34:10.700 --> 3:34:21.700
 And what one person will describe as a meaningful life and other person will decry is meaningless or wasted.

3:34:21.700 --> 3:34:28.700
 There's something terrible about the idea that we're sitting around waiting for meaning to show up on our doorstep.

3:34:28.700 --> 3:34:40.700
 But what I find the best people do is they take charge of it and they look at their lives in a form of authorship where they see their life as a tale to be written.

3:34:40.700 --> 3:34:49.700
 And they do their best to write that tale and put as much control over the direction of the story as they can.

3:34:49.700 --> 3:34:56.700
 In the end, we all have to just try and write our own story.

3:34:56.700 --> 3:34:58.700
 We all have our own interests.

3:34:58.700 --> 3:35:09.700
 I try to bring in the sense that even though I'm an atheist, I don't believe that we go on to live after this.

3:35:09.700 --> 3:35:13.700
 I believe that there's a possibility of a God in afterlife.

3:35:13.700 --> 3:35:22.700
 I don't say it's impossible, but in order for me to believe that they exist, I'd have to see better evidence than I see currently.

3:35:22.700 --> 3:35:30.700
 Nonetheless, I do believe that there is a great value in the idea of living for something bigger than yourself.

3:35:30.700 --> 3:35:39.700
 The moment you see yourself as the be all and end all of your existence, you're in for a meaningless life and nothing will ever satisfy you.

3:35:39.700 --> 3:35:44.700
 You can have all the money in the world. You can have all the power in the world. You'll be empty inside.

3:35:44.700 --> 3:35:56.700
 I do believe that humans have a deep and abiding need to follow the interests of a group bigger than themselves as an individual.

3:35:56.700 --> 3:36:03.700
 Is it ideal? No. Is it an answer to the meaning of life? No, because eventually that group will itself die out.

3:36:03.700 --> 3:36:10.700
 So there's a sense in which it just plays a kind of delaying game.

3:36:10.700 --> 3:36:20.700
 But I do believe that in order to live a happy life, meaning is a central part of that and the deepest sense of meaning.

3:36:20.700 --> 3:36:34.700
 Not a fully complete answer, but a better answer than most people give is to find something which hopefully does very little harm to the people around you and mostly benefits them,

3:36:34.700 --> 3:36:46.700
 which enables you to become part of a community and to live, as I said, for something larger than you as an individual.

3:36:46.700 --> 3:36:56.700
 If there is such a thing as a perfect conversation, it would be a conversation on death, meaning, and robots.

3:36:56.700 --> 3:37:05.700
 With the great John Donahar Abin Afan, it's a huge honor that you would waste all your time today. Thank you so much for talking today.

3:37:05.700 --> 3:37:27.700
 My pleasure. Thank you, Lex.

3:37:27.700 --> 3:37:41.700
 In training, the objective is skill development, to not confuse them. As such, one of the best ways to train is to identify the strengths of your various partners and regularly expose yourself to those strengths.

3:37:41.700 --> 3:38:01.700
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
