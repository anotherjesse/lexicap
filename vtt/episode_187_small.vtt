00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
 The following is a conversation with Frank Wilczek, a theoretical physicist at MIT,

00:04.880 --> 00:10.800
 who won the Nobel Prize for the co discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of strong

00:10.800 --> 00:18.720
 interaction. Quick mention of our sponsors, The Information, Netsuite, ExpressVPN, Blinkist,

00:18.720 --> 00:22.800
 and AIDSSleep. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:23.440 --> 00:29.040
 As a side note, let me say a word about asymptotic freedom. Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus

00:29.040 --> 00:34.080
 of an atom. Strong interaction is responsible for the strong nuclear force that binds them,

00:34.080 --> 00:39.920
 but strong interaction also holds together the quarks that make up the protons and neutrons.

00:39.920 --> 00:45.520
 Frank Wilczek, David Gross, and David Pulitzer came up with a theory postulating that when

00:45.520 --> 00:50.320
 quarks come really close to one another, the attraction abates and they behave like free

00:50.320 --> 00:57.680
 particles. This is called asymptotic freedom. This happens at very, very high energies,

00:57.680 --> 01:04.640
 which is also where all the fun is. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation

01:04.640 --> 01:10.080
 with Frank Wilczek. What is the most beautiful idea in physics?

01:10.880 --> 01:19.440
 The most beautiful idea in physics is that we can get a compact description of the world that's

01:19.440 --> 01:28.640
 very precise and very full at the level of the operating system of the world. That's

01:30.160 --> 01:38.480
 an extraordinary gift, and we get worried when we have fine discrepancies between

01:39.040 --> 01:45.840
 our description of the world and what's actually observed at the level even of a part in a billion.

01:45.840 --> 01:51.680
 You actually have this quote from Einstein that the most incomprehensible thing,

01:51.680 --> 01:55.600
 but the universe is that it is comprehensible, something like that.

01:55.600 --> 02:05.120
 Yes. That's the most beautiful surprise that really was, to me, the most profound result of

02:05.120 --> 02:12.960
 the scientific revolution of the 17th century with the shining example of Newtonian physics

02:12.960 --> 02:20.240
 that you could aspire to completeness, precision, and a concise description of the world of the

02:20.240 --> 02:26.880
 operating system, and it's gotten better and better over the years, and that's the continuing

02:26.880 --> 02:33.040
 miracle. Now, there are a lot of beautiful submiracles, too. The form of the equations is

02:33.040 --> 02:40.080
 governed by high degrees of symmetry, and they have a very surprising kind of mind expanding

02:40.080 --> 02:46.400
 structure, especially in quantum mechanics. But if I have to say that the single most

02:46.400 --> 02:52.560
 beautiful revelation is that, in fact, the world is comprehensible.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.200
 Would you say that's a fact or a hope?

02:56.320 --> 03:04.480
 It's a fact. You can point to things like the rise of

03:04.480 --> 03:14.080
 gross national products per capita around the world as a result of the scientific revolution.

03:14.080 --> 03:21.680
 You can see it all around you in recent developments, so exponential production of wealth,

03:22.480 --> 03:31.360
 control of nature at a very profound level where we do things like sense tiny, tiny, tiny,

03:31.360 --> 03:40.080
 tiny vibrations to tell that there are black holes colliding far away, or we test laws as I

03:40.080 --> 03:47.760
 alluded to, as a part in a billion, and do things in what appear on the surface to be

03:47.760 --> 03:52.160
 entirely different conceptual universes. I mean, on the one hand, pencil and paper or

03:52.160 --> 03:58.480
 nowadays computers that calculate abstractions, and on the other hand, magnets and accelerators

03:58.480 --> 04:04.240
 and detectors that look at the behavior of fundamental particles, and these different

04:04.240 --> 04:12.000
 universes have to agree or else we get very upset. And that's an amazing thing if you think about it.

04:13.360 --> 04:20.240
 It's telling us that we do understand a lot about nature at a very profound level,

04:20.240 --> 04:28.800
 and there are still things we don't understand, of course, but as we get better and better answers

04:28.800 --> 04:34.640
 and better and better ability to address difficult questions, we can ask more and more ambitious

04:34.640 --> 04:41.440
 questions. Well, I guess the hope part of that is because we are surrounded by mystery, so one

04:41.440 --> 04:47.200
 way to say it, if you look at the growth of GDP, over time that we figured out quite a lot and

04:47.200 --> 04:52.240
 we're able to improve the quality of life because of that, and we've figured out some

04:52.240 --> 04:57.280
 fundamental things about this universe, but we still don't know how much mystery there is,

04:57.280 --> 05:04.480
 and it's also possible that there's some things that are, in fact, incomprehensible to both our

05:04.480 --> 05:12.960
 minds and the tools of science. The sad thing is we may not know it because, in fact, they are

05:12.960 --> 05:18.080
 incomprehensible. And that's the open question, is how much of the universe is comprehensible?

05:18.080 --> 05:25.120
 If we figured out everything was inside the black hole and everything that happened at the

05:25.120 --> 05:30.640
 moment of the Big Bang, does that still give us the key to understanding the human mind

05:30.640 --> 05:35.440
 and the emergence of all the beautiful complexity we see around us? That's not,

05:36.320 --> 05:40.640
 like, when I see these objects, like, I don't know if you've seen them, like cellular automata,

05:40.640 --> 05:47.760
 all these kinds of objects where from simple rules emerges complexity, it makes you wonder,

05:47.760 --> 05:54.160
 maybe, it's not reducible to simple, beautiful equations, the whole thing, only parts of it.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.720
 That's the tension I was getting at with the hope.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.640
 Well, when we say the universe is comprehensible, we have to

06:00.640 --> 06:11.440
 kind of draw careful distinctions about, or definitions about what we mean by that.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.200
 Both the universe and the comprehensibles.

06:15.200 --> 06:28.160
 Exactly. So in certain areas of understanding reality, we've made extraordinary progress,

06:28.160 --> 06:33.840
 I would say, in understanding fundamental physical processes and getting very precise

06:33.840 --> 06:41.600
 equations that really work and allow us to do profound sculpting of matter, to make computers

06:41.600 --> 06:45.440
 and iPhones and everything else, and they really work, and they're extraordinary productions.

06:50.720 --> 06:55.360
 That's all based on the laws of quantum mechanics, and they really work.

06:55.360 --> 07:04.640
 And they give us tremendous control of nature. On the other hand, as we get better answers,

07:04.640 --> 07:08.400
 we can also ask more ambitious questions, and there are certainly things that

07:09.120 --> 07:15.520
 have been observed even in what would be usually called the realm of physics that

07:15.520 --> 07:21.680
 aren't understood. For instance, there seems to be another source of mass in the universe,

07:21.680 --> 07:26.400
 the so called dark matter, that we don't know what it is, and it's a very interesting question

07:26.400 --> 07:36.080
 what it is. But also, as you were alluding to, it's one thing to know the basic equations.

07:36.720 --> 07:44.560
 It's another thing to be able to solve them in important cases. So we run up against the limits

07:44.560 --> 07:50.240
 of that in things like chemistry, where we'd like to be able to design molecules and predict their

07:50.240 --> 07:58.800
 behavior from the equations. We think the equations could do that in principle, but in practice,

07:58.800 --> 08:05.920
 it's very challenging to solve them in all but very simple cases. And then there's the other

08:05.920 --> 08:13.280
 thing, which is that a lot of what we're interested in is historically conditioned. It's not a

08:13.280 --> 08:21.440
 matter of the fundamental equations, but about what has evolved or come out of the early universe

08:21.440 --> 08:27.520
 and formed into people and frogs and societies and things. And the laws of physics, the basic

08:27.520 --> 08:33.680
 laws of physics only take you so far, and that kind of provides a foundation but doesn't really,

08:33.680 --> 08:44.880
 the unique entirely different concepts to deal with those kind of systems. And one thing I can

08:44.880 --> 08:50.160
 say about that is that the laws themselves point out their limitations, that they kind of,

08:50.160 --> 08:56.240
 their laws for dynamical evolution. So they tell you what happens if you have a certain starting

08:56.240 --> 09:04.160
 point, but they don't tell you what the starting point should be at least. And the other thing

09:04.160 --> 09:13.840
 that emerges from the equations themselves is the phenomena of chaos and sensitivity to initial

09:13.840 --> 09:23.120
 conditions, which tells us that there are intrinsic limitations on how well we can spell

09:23.120 --> 09:28.320
 out the consequences of the laws if we try to apply them. The old apple pie, if you want to,

09:28.320 --> 09:33.600
 what does it make an apple pie from scratch? You have to build the universe or something like that.

09:35.440 --> 09:39.760
 You're much better off starting with apples than starting with quarks. Let's put it that way.

09:39.760 --> 09:45.440
 In your book, A Beautiful Question, you ask, does the world body beautiful ideas? So the book is

09:45.440 --> 09:50.480
 centered around this very interesting question. It's like Shakespeare. You can like dig in and

09:50.480 --> 09:54.800
 read into all the different interpretations of this question. But at the high level,

09:55.520 --> 10:01.120
 what to use the connection between beauty of the world and physics of the world?

10:02.080 --> 10:07.920
 In a sense, we now have a lot of insight into what the laws are, the form they take that

10:08.640 --> 10:15.120
 allow us to understand matter in great depth and control it as we've discussed.

10:15.120 --> 10:25.760
 And it's an extraordinary thing how mathematically ideal those equations turn out to be.

10:26.560 --> 10:35.680
 In the early days of Greek philosophy, Plato had this model of atoms built out of the five

10:35.680 --> 10:41.440
 perfectly symmetrical botanic solids. So there was somehow the idea that mathematical symmetry

10:41.440 --> 10:50.320
 should govern the world. And we've outplayed out Plato by far in modern physics because we have

10:50.320 --> 10:54.560
 symmetries that are much more extensive, much more powerful, that turn out to be

10:55.600 --> 10:59.920
 the ingredients out of which we construct our theory of the world. And it works.

10:59.920 --> 11:09.680
 And so that's certainly beautiful. So the math, the idea of symmetry, which is

11:10.720 --> 11:19.840
 a driving inspiration in much of human art, especially decorative art, like the Alhambra

11:19.840 --> 11:27.920
 or wallpaper designs or things you see around you everywhere, also turns out to be the dominant theme

11:27.920 --> 11:34.400
 in modern fundamental physics, symmetry and its manifestations. The laws turn out to be very,

11:34.400 --> 11:38.720
 to have these tremendous amounts of symmetry. You can change the symbols and move them around

11:38.720 --> 11:48.160
 in different ways and they still have the same consequences. So that's beautiful.

11:48.160 --> 11:59.840
 And that these things, these different, these concepts that humans find appealing,

12:00.480 --> 12:05.200
 also turn out to be the concepts that govern how the world actually works.

12:07.520 --> 12:14.160
 I don't think that's an accident. I think humans were evolved to be able to interact with the world

12:14.160 --> 12:22.240
 in ways that are advantageous and to learn from it. And so we are naturally evolved or designed

12:22.240 --> 12:30.880
 to enjoy beauty and to symmetry and the world has it. And that's why we resonate with it.

12:30.880 --> 12:38.960
 Well, it's interesting that the ideas of symmetry emerge at menu levels of the hierarchy

12:38.960 --> 12:46.880
 of the universe. So you're talking about particles, but it also is at the level of chemistry and biology

12:49.440 --> 12:57.680
 and the fact that our cognitive, sort of our perception system and whatever our cognition is

12:57.680 --> 13:04.560
 also finds it appealing or somehow our sense of what is beautiful is grounded in this idea of

13:04.560 --> 13:09.360
 symmetry or the breaking of symmetry. Symmetry is at the core of our conception of beauty,

13:09.360 --> 13:18.000
 whether it's the breaking or the non breaking of the symmetry. It makes you wonder why, why?

13:19.520 --> 13:26.400
 Like, so I come from Russia and the question of Dostoevsky, he's said that beauty will save

13:26.400 --> 13:30.640
 the world. Maybe as a physicist you can tell me, what do you think he meant by that?

13:30.640 --> 13:36.400
 I don't know if it saves the world, but it does turn out to be a tremendous source of insight into

13:36.400 --> 13:45.120
 the world when we investigate kind of the most fundamental interactions, things that are hard

13:45.120 --> 13:55.040
 to access because they occur at very short distances between very special kinds of particles

13:55.040 --> 14:02.800
 whose properties are only revealed at high energies. We don't have much to go on from

14:02.800 --> 14:08.480
 everyday life, but so we have when we guess what the, and the experiments are difficult to do,

14:08.480 --> 14:19.040
 so you can't really follow a very wholly empirical procedure to sort of in the Baconian style,

14:19.040 --> 14:22.480
 figure out the laws kind of step by step just by accumulating a lot of data.

14:22.480 --> 14:30.480
 What we actually do is guess, and the guesses are kind of aesthetic really, what would be a nice

14:30.480 --> 14:36.160
 description that's consistent with what we know, and then you try it out and see if it works,

14:36.160 --> 14:45.360
 and by gosh it does in many profound cases. So there's that, but there's another source

14:45.360 --> 14:53.760
 of symmetry, which I didn't talk so much about in a beautiful question, but does

14:55.520 --> 15:02.560
 relate to your comments, and I think very much relates to the source of symmetry that we find in

15:02.560 --> 15:17.600
 biology and in our heads, in our brain, which is that, well, it is discussed a bit in a beautiful

15:17.600 --> 15:27.280
 question and also in fundamentals, is that when you have, symmetry is also a very important

15:27.280 --> 15:36.480
 means of construction, so when you have, for instance, simple viruses that need to construct

15:36.480 --> 15:41.920
 their coat, their protein coat, the coats often take the form of platonic solids,

15:43.440 --> 15:48.880
 and the reason is that the deviruses are really dumb, and they only know how to do one thing,

15:48.880 --> 15:52.640
 so they make a pentagon, then they make another pentagon, and they make another pentagon, and

15:52.640 --> 15:59.600
 they all glue together in the same way, and that makes a very symmetrical object, so the rules of

15:59.600 --> 16:06.880
 development, when you have simple rules and they work again and again, you get symmetrical patterns,

16:06.880 --> 16:17.440
 that's kind of, in fact, it's a recipe also for generating fractals, like the kind of broccoli

16:17.440 --> 16:21.680
 that has all this internal structure, and I wish I had a picture to show, but maybe people

16:21.680 --> 16:30.160
 remember it from the supermarket, and you say, how did a vegetable get so intelligent to make

16:30.160 --> 16:35.760
 such a beautiful object with all this fractal structure, and the secret is stupidity,

16:35.760 --> 16:43.680
 you just do the same thing over and over again, and in our brains, also, we came out, we start

16:43.680 --> 16:54.560
 from single cells, and they reproduce, and each one does roughly the same thing, the program

16:54.560 --> 17:02.320
 evolves in time, of course, different modules get turned on and off, different regions of

17:02.320 --> 17:08.400
 the genetic code get turned on and off, but basically, a lot of the same things are going

17:08.400 --> 17:12.320
 on, and they're simple things, and so you produce the same patterns over and over again,

17:12.320 --> 17:16.320
 and that's a recipe for producing symmetry, because you're getting the same thing in many,

17:16.320 --> 17:25.440
 many places, and if you look at, for instance, the beautiful drawings of Ramon Icahal, the great

17:25.440 --> 17:32.480
 neuroanatomist who drew the structure of different organs like the hippocampus,

17:32.480 --> 17:45.600
 you see it's very regular and very intricate, and it's symmetry in that sense, it's many

17:45.600 --> 17:50.720
 repeated units that you can take from one place to the other and see that they look more or less

17:50.720 --> 17:56.400
 the same. But what you're describing, this kind of beauty that we're talking about now is a very

17:56.400 --> 18:07.040
 small sample in terms of space time in a very big world, in a very short, brief moment in this

18:07.040 --> 18:13.120
 long history. In your book, Fundamentals, 10 Keys to Reality, I'd really recommend people read it.

18:14.560 --> 18:21.520
 You say that space and time are pretty big, or very big. How big are we talking about? Like,

18:21.520 --> 18:27.840
 what can you draw? Can you tell a brief history of space and time?

18:27.840 --> 18:34.320
 It's easy to tell a brief history, but the details get very involved, of course. But one thing I'd

18:34.320 --> 18:40.080
 like to say is that if you take a broad enough view, the history of the universe is simpler than

18:40.080 --> 18:48.480
 the history of Sweden, say, because your standards are lower. But just to make it

18:48.480 --> 18:56.400
 quantitative, I'll just give a few highlights. And it's a little bit easier to talk about time.

18:57.280 --> 19:04.080
 So let's start with that. The Big Bang occurred. We think the universe was much hotter and denser

19:04.080 --> 19:10.240
 and more uniform about 13.8 billion years ago. And that's what we call the Big Bang.

19:12.480 --> 19:16.720
 And it's been expanding and cooling. The matter in it has been expanding and cooling

19:16.720 --> 19:24.080
 ever since. So in a real sense, the universe is 13.8 billion years old. That's a big number,

19:24.080 --> 19:31.440
 kind of hard to think about. A nice way to think about it, though, is to map it onto one year.

19:31.440 --> 19:38.960
 So let's say the universe just linearly mapped the time intervals from 13.8 billion years onto

19:38.960 --> 19:51.120
 one year. So the Big Bang, then, is that on January 1st at 12am. And you wait for quite a long time

19:52.160 --> 19:56.800
 before the dinosaurs emerge. The dinosaurs emerge on Christmas, it turns out.

19:57.840 --> 20:01.200
 12 months, almost 12 months later. Getting close to the end.

20:01.200 --> 20:11.440
 And the extinction event that let mammals and ultimately humans inherit the earth from

20:12.960 --> 20:20.160
 the dinosaurs occurred on December 30th. And all of human history is a small part of the last day.

20:20.160 --> 20:30.960
 And so, yes, so we're occupying only a human lifetime is a very, very infinitesimal part of this

20:31.760 --> 20:41.680
 interval of these gigantic cosmic reaches of time. And in space, we can tell a very similar story.

20:41.680 --> 20:50.320
 In fact, it's convenient to think that the size of the universe is the distance that light can

20:50.320 --> 20:58.320
 travel in 13.8 billion years. So it's 13.8 billion light years. That's how far you can see out.

20:58.320 --> 21:11.280
 That's how far signals can reach us from. And that is a big distance because compared to that,

21:12.160 --> 21:21.280
 the universe, the earth is a fraction of a light second. So again, it's really, really big.

21:21.280 --> 21:28.880
 And so we have, if we want to think about the universe as a whole in space and time,

21:30.240 --> 21:37.600
 we really need a different kind of imagination. It's not something you can

21:41.040 --> 21:45.360
 grasp in terms of psychological time in a useful way. You have to think, you know,

21:45.360 --> 21:53.120
 you have to use exponential notation and abstract concepts to really get any hold on these vast

21:53.120 --> 22:00.160
 times and spaces. On the other hand, let me hasten to add that that doesn't make us small

22:01.520 --> 22:12.000
 or make the time that we have to us small. Because again, looking at those pictures of what

22:12.000 --> 22:18.080
 our minds are and some of the components of our minds, these beautiful drawings of the cellular

22:18.080 --> 22:25.200
 patterns inside the brain, you see that there are many, many, many processing units. And if you

22:25.200 --> 22:32.240
 analyze how fast they operate, I try to estimate how many thoughts a person can have in a lifetime.

22:32.240 --> 22:38.320
 That's kind of a fuzzy question, but I'm very proud that I was able to define it pretty precisely.

22:38.320 --> 22:44.720
 And it turns out we can, we have time for billions of meaningful thoughts

22:45.360 --> 22:51.120
 in a lifetime. So it's a lot. We shouldn't think of ourselves as terribly small,

22:51.760 --> 22:58.000
 either in space or in time, because although we're small in those dimensions compared to

22:58.000 --> 23:07.920
 the universe, we're large compared to meaningful units of processing information and being able

23:07.920 --> 23:15.440
 to conceptualize and understand things. Yeah, but 99% of those thoughts are probably food, sex,

23:15.440 --> 23:23.600
 or internet related. Well, that's only like 0.1 is Nobel Prize winning ideas.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.600
 But that's true. But you know, there's more to life than winning Nobel prizes.

23:27.600 --> 23:32.000
 How did you do that calculate? Can you maybe break that apart a little bit just kind of

23:32.000 --> 23:35.760
 for fun, sort of an intuition of how we calculate the number of thoughts?

23:35.760 --> 23:40.480
 The number of thoughts, right. It's necessarily imprecise because a lot of

23:40.480 --> 23:45.360
 things are going on in a different way than what is a thought. But there are several things that

23:45.360 --> 23:52.320
 point to more or less the same rate of being able to have meaningful thoughts.

23:54.400 --> 24:02.720
 For instance, the one that I think is maybe the most penetrating is how fast we can process

24:02.720 --> 24:10.560
 visual images. How do we do that? If you've ever watched old movies,

24:11.280 --> 24:17.520
 you can see that when, well, any movie, in fact, that in a motion picture is really not a motion

24:17.520 --> 24:23.680
 picture. It's a series of snapshots that are playing one after the other. And it's because

24:23.680 --> 24:29.760
 our brains also work that way. We take snapshots of the world, integrate over a certain time,

24:29.760 --> 24:35.360
 and then go on to the next one. And then by post processing, create the illusion of continuity

24:35.360 --> 24:45.760
 and flow, we can deal with that. And if the flicker rate is too slow, then you start to see

24:45.760 --> 24:52.160
 that it's a series of snapshots. And you can ask, what is the crossover? When does it change from

24:52.160 --> 24:58.720
 being something that is matched to our processing speed versus too fast? And it turns out about

24:58.720 --> 25:07.440
 40 per second. And then if you take 40 per second as how fast we can process visual images, you get

25:07.440 --> 25:15.920
 to several billions of thoughts. Similarly, if you ask, what are some of the fastest things

25:15.920 --> 25:21.040
 that people can do? Well, they can play video games. They can play the piano very fast if

25:21.040 --> 25:26.480
 they're skilled at it. And again, you get to similar units or how fast can people talk?

25:26.480 --> 25:31.120
 You get to similar, you know, within a couple of orders of magnitude, you get more or less to

25:31.120 --> 25:40.160
 the same idea. So that's how you can say that there's billions of meaning, there's room for

25:40.160 --> 25:47.600
 billions of meaningful thoughts. I won't argue for exactly 2 billion versus 1.8 billion. It's

25:47.600 --> 25:53.360
 not that kind of question. But I think any estimate that's reasonable will come out

25:53.360 --> 25:59.600
 within, say, 100 billion and 100 million. So it's a lot.

26:01.520 --> 26:07.120
 It would be interesting to map out for an individual human being the landscape of thoughts

26:07.120 --> 26:12.480
 that they've sort of traveled. If you think of thoughts as a set of trajectories,

26:14.240 --> 26:19.760
 what that landscape looks like? I mean, I've been recently really thinking about

26:19.760 --> 26:27.680
 this Richard Dawkins idea of memes and just all these ideas and the evolution of ideas

26:27.680 --> 26:34.480
 inside of one particular human mind and how they're then changed and evolved by interaction

26:34.480 --> 26:40.960
 with other human beings. It's interesting to think about. So if you think the numbers, billions,

26:41.840 --> 26:47.920
 you think there's also social interaction. So these aren't like there's interaction

26:47.920 --> 26:52.560
 in the same way you have interaction with particles. There's interaction between human thoughts

26:53.360 --> 26:59.840
 that perhaps that interaction in itself is fundamental to the process of thinking. Without

26:59.840 --> 27:06.800
 social interaction, we would be stuck walking in a circle. We need the perturbation of other

27:06.800 --> 27:14.400
 humans to create change in evolution. Once you bring in concepts of interactions and correlations

27:14.400 --> 27:21.280
 and relations, then you have what's called a combinatorial explosion that the number of

27:21.280 --> 27:28.240
 possibilities expands exponentially technically with the number of things you're considering.

27:28.880 --> 27:36.080
 And it can easily, rapidly outstrip these billions of thoughts that we're talking about.

27:36.080 --> 27:46.880
 So we definitely cannot buy brute force master complex situations and or think of all the

27:46.880 --> 27:52.160
 possibilities in a complex situations. I mean, even something as relatively simple as chess

27:53.360 --> 27:58.720
 is still something that human beings can't comprehend completely. Even the best players

27:58.720 --> 28:06.240
 lose, still sometimes lose, and they consistently lose to computers these days. And in computer

28:06.240 --> 28:12.080
 science, there's a concept of NP complete. So large classes of problems when you scale them up

28:12.080 --> 28:19.920
 beyond a few individuals become intractable. And so that in that sense, the world is inexhaustible.

28:19.920 --> 28:29.440
 But in that makes it beautiful that we can make any laws that generalize efficiently and well

28:29.440 --> 28:34.800
 can compress all of that combinatorial complexity just like a simple rule that that itself is

28:34.800 --> 28:43.600
 beautiful. It's a happy situation. And I think that that we can find general principles of sort

28:43.600 --> 28:50.800
 of the operating system that are comprehensible, simple, extremely powerful, and let us control

28:50.800 --> 28:57.120
 things very well and ask profound questions. And on the other hand, that the world is going

28:57.120 --> 29:04.640
 to be inexhaustible. That once we start asking about relationships and how they evolve and

29:05.440 --> 29:12.240
 social interactions, and we'll never have a theory of everything in any meaningful sense because

29:12.240 --> 29:19.120
 of that. Of everything, everything. Truly everything is. Can I ask you about the Big Bang?

29:19.840 --> 29:27.680
 So we talked about the space and time are really big. But then and we humans give a lot of meaning

29:27.680 --> 29:36.480
 to the word space and time in our in our like daily lives. But then can we talk about this moment

29:36.480 --> 29:42.400
 of beginning and how we're supposed to think about it? That at the moment of the Big Bang,

29:42.400 --> 29:49.760
 everything was what like infinitely small. And then it just blew up. We have to be careful here

29:49.760 --> 29:58.960
 because there's a common misconception that the Big Bang is like the explosion of a bomb in empty

29:58.960 --> 30:06.480
 space that fills up the surrounding place. It is space. It is. Yeah. As we as we understand it,

30:07.040 --> 30:17.040
 it's the fact, it's the fact or the hypothesis, but well supported up to a point that that

30:17.840 --> 30:26.480
 everywhere in the whole universe, early in the history, matter came together into a very hot,

30:26.480 --> 30:32.640
 very dense. If you run it backwards in time, matter comes together into a very hot, very dense,

30:32.640 --> 30:39.440
 and yet very homogeneous plasma of all the different kinds of elementary particles and

30:39.440 --> 30:43.520
 quarks and anti quarks and gluons and photons and electrons and anti electrons, everything,

30:43.520 --> 30:49.920
 you know, all of that stuff, like really hot, really, really, really hot. We're talking about

30:49.920 --> 30:58.800
 way, way hotter than the surface of the sun. Well, in fact, if you take the equations as we,

30:59.440 --> 31:04.800
 as they come, the prediction is that the temperature just goes to infinity, but then the equations

31:06.160 --> 31:09.840
 break down. We don't, you know, we don't, don't really, there are various,

31:10.560 --> 31:14.960
 the equations become infinity equals infinity. So they don't feel that it's called a singularity.

31:14.960 --> 31:21.200
 We don't really know this is running the equations backwards. So you can't really get a sensible

31:21.200 --> 31:26.160
 idea of what happened before the Big Bang. We don't, you know, so we need different equations to

31:26.160 --> 31:36.960
 address the very earliest moments. But so things were hotter and denser. We don't really know

31:36.960 --> 31:44.240
 why things started out that way. We do, we have a lot of evidence that they did start out that way.

31:44.240 --> 31:54.880
 But since most of the, you know, we don't get to visit there and do controlled experiments,

31:55.440 --> 32:02.000
 most, most of the, most of the record is, is very, very processed. And we have to, we have to use

32:02.000 --> 32:10.480
 very subtle techniques and powerful instruments to, to get information that has survived.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.640
 Get closer and closer to the Big Bang.

32:12.640 --> 32:20.560
 Get closer and closer to the, the beginning of things. And what's revealed there is that,

32:22.080 --> 32:27.600
 as I said, there, there undoubtedly was a period when everything in the universe that we

32:27.600 --> 32:33.840
 have been able to look at and understand, and that's consistent with everything, is

32:36.880 --> 32:42.560
 the, was in a condition where it was much, much hotter and much, much denser,

32:44.160 --> 32:50.960
 but still obeying the laws of physics as we know them today. And, and then you start with that.

32:50.960 --> 32:58.720
 So all the matter is in equilibrium. And then with small quantum fluctuations and run it forward.

32:59.440 --> 33:06.400
 And then it produces, at least in broad strokes, the universe we see around us today.

33:06.400 --> 33:11.840
 Do you think we'll ever be able to, with the tools of physics, with the way sciences,

33:12.480 --> 33:17.600
 with the way the human mind is, we'll ever be able to get to the moment of the Big Bang

33:17.600 --> 33:22.800
 in our understanding or even the moment before the Big Bang? Can we understand what happened

33:22.800 --> 33:32.560
 before the Big Bang? I'm, I'm optimistic, both that we'll be able to measure more, so observe more,

33:33.440 --> 33:40.960
 and that we'll be able to figure out more. So they're very, very tangible prospects for

33:40.960 --> 33:46.880
 observing the extremely early universe, so much, even much earlier than we can observe now,

33:48.000 --> 33:53.760
 through looking at gravitational waves. Gravitational waves, since they interact so

33:53.760 --> 34:01.920
 weakly with ordinary matter, sort of send an un, a minimally processed signal from the Big

34:01.920 --> 34:07.920
 Bang. It's a very weak signal because it's traveled a long way and diffused over long spaces.

34:07.920 --> 34:13.920
 But, but people are gearing up to try to detect gravitational waves that could have come from

34:13.920 --> 34:19.120
 the early universe. Yeah, LIGO's incredible engineering project. It's the most sensitive,

34:19.840 --> 34:26.400
 precise devices on earth. The fact that humans can build something like that is

34:27.040 --> 34:32.640
 truly awe inspiring from an engineering perspective. Right. And, but these gravitational waves from

34:32.640 --> 34:39.920
 the early universe will probably be of a much longer wavelength than LIGO is capable of sensing.

34:39.920 --> 34:51.360
 So there's a beautiful project that's contemplated to put lasers in different part, different

34:51.360 --> 34:57.840
 locations in the solar system. You know, we really, really separated by solar system scale

34:57.840 --> 35:05.520
 differences like artificial planets or moons in different places and see the tiny motions of

35:05.520 --> 35:11.600
 those relative to one another as a signal of radiation from the Big Bang. We can also maybe

35:12.240 --> 35:20.480
 indirectly see the imprint of gravitational waves from the early universe on the photons,

35:20.480 --> 35:26.640
 the, the microwave background radiation that is our present way of, of seeing into the earliest

35:26.640 --> 35:31.760
 universe. But those, those photons interact much more strongly with matter. They're much more

35:31.760 --> 35:39.200
 strongly processed. So they don't give us directly such an unprocessed view of the early universe,

35:39.200 --> 35:47.040
 of the very early universe. But if gravitational waves leave some imprint on that as they move

35:47.040 --> 35:52.080
 through, we could detect that too. And people are trying our, as we speak,

35:52.080 --> 35:59.280
 working very hard towards, towards that goal. It's so exciting to think about a sensor the size

35:59.280 --> 36:04.400
 of the solar system. Like, that would be a fantastic, I mean, that would be a pinnacle

36:05.280 --> 36:12.160
 artifact of human endeavor to me. It would be such such an inspiring thing that just

36:12.880 --> 36:19.840
 we want to know. And we go to these extraordinary lengths of making gigantic things that are also

36:19.840 --> 36:24.880
 very sophisticated. Because what you're trying to do, you have to understand how they move. You

36:24.880 --> 36:30.720
 have to understand the properties of light that they're being used, the interference between light

36:30.720 --> 36:35.840
 and, and you have to be able to make the light with lasers and understand the quantum theory and

36:35.840 --> 36:41.520
 get the timing exactly right. And it's an extraordinary endeavor involving all kinds

36:41.520 --> 36:46.640
 of knowledge from the very strong, very small to the very large, and all in the service of

36:46.640 --> 36:58.160
 curiosity and built on a grand scale. So yeah, it would make me proud to be a human if we did that.

36:58.160 --> 37:03.200
 I love that you're inspired both by, by the power of theory and the power of experiments. So the

37:03.200 --> 37:09.760
 both, both I think are exceptionally impressed that the human mind can come up with theories

37:09.760 --> 37:16.000
 that give us a peek into how the universe works, but also construct tools that are way bigger

37:16.800 --> 37:22.400
 than the, the evolutionary origins we came from. Right. And by the way, you know, the fact that

37:22.400 --> 37:28.720
 we can design such things and they work, yeah, is an extraordinary demonstration that we really

37:28.720 --> 37:36.800
 do understand a lot. And then in some ways, and it's our ability to answer questions that also

37:36.800 --> 37:42.160
 leads us to be able to address more ambitious questions. So you mentioned that at the, at the

37:42.160 --> 37:50.720
 big bang in the early days, things are pretty homogeneous. Yes. But here we are sitting on Earth

37:51.600 --> 37:58.800
 to hairless apes, you could say with microphones in talking about the brief history of things you

37:58.800 --> 38:05.200
 said it's much harder to describe Sweden than it is the universe. So there's a lot of complexity,

38:05.200 --> 38:10.560
 there was a lot of interesting details here. So how does this complexity come to be, do you think?

38:11.120 --> 38:15.120
 It seems like there's these pockets. Yeah. We don't know how rare of like

38:16.400 --> 38:23.440
 where hairless apes emerge. Yeah. And then that came from the initial soup that was homogeneous.

38:23.440 --> 38:29.760
 Was that, is that an accident? Well, we understand there, we understand in broad

38:29.760 --> 38:36.640
 outlines how it could happen. We certainly don't understand why it happened exactly in the way it

38:36.640 --> 38:44.320
 did. But, but, or, you know, there are certainly open questions about the origins of life and how

38:44.320 --> 38:51.360
 inevitable the emergence of intelligence was and, and how that happened. But in the very broadest

38:51.360 --> 39:02.080
 terms, the universe early on was quite homogeneous, but not completely homogeneous. There are,

39:02.080 --> 39:13.280
 there were part in 10,000 fluctuations in density within this primordial plasma. And as time goes on,

39:13.280 --> 39:21.120
 there's an instability which causes those density contrasts to increase. There's a gravitational

39:21.120 --> 39:26.400
 instability where it's denser, the gravitational attractions are stronger. And so that brings

39:26.400 --> 39:33.200
 in more matter and it gets even denser and so on and so on. So, so there's a natural tendency of

39:33.200 --> 39:39.680
 matter to clump because of gravitational interactions. And then the equation is complicated.

39:39.680 --> 39:46.880
 We have lots of things clumping together. Then, you know, then, then we know what the laws are,

39:46.880 --> 39:51.920
 but we have to, to a certain extent, wave our hands about what, what, what happens. But

39:53.280 --> 40:00.480
 basic understanding of chemistry says that if things and, and the physics of radiation tells us

40:00.480 --> 40:05.840
 that if, as things start to clump together, they can radiate, give off some energy so they don't

40:05.840 --> 40:10.960
 move, just they slow down. They, as a result, they lose energy, they can clump it together,

40:10.960 --> 40:18.640
 cool down, form things like stars, form things like planets. And so in broad terms, there's no

40:18.640 --> 40:24.720
 mystery. There's that, that's what the scenario, that's what the equations tell you should happen.

40:24.720 --> 40:36.000
 But because it's a process involving many, many fundamental individual units,

40:36.000 --> 40:41.920
 the, the application of the laws that govern simply individual units to these things is, is

40:43.680 --> 40:51.520
 very delicate or, you know, computationally very difficult. And more profoundly, the equations

40:51.520 --> 40:56.560
 have this probability of chaos or sensitivity to initial conditions, which tells you tiny

40:56.560 --> 41:02.320
 differences in the initial state can lead to enormous differences in the subsequent behavior.

41:02.320 --> 41:11.120
 So, so physics, fundamental physics at some point says, okay, chemists, biologists, this is your

41:11.120 --> 41:22.960
 problem. And, and, and then again, in broad terms, we know how it's conceivable that, that humans

41:22.960 --> 41:30.320
 and things like that can, can, that how complex structure can emerge. It's a matter of having

41:32.240 --> 41:36.800
 the right kind of temperature and the right kind of stuff. So you need,

41:36.800 --> 41:44.720
 you need to be able to make chemical bonds that are reasonably stable and be able to make complex

41:44.720 --> 41:53.040
 structures. And we're very fortunate that carbon has this ability to make backbones and, and elaborate

41:53.040 --> 41:58.960
 branching and things. So you can get complex things that we call biochemistry. And, and yet

41:58.960 --> 42:04.880
 the bonds can be broken a little bit with the help of energetic injections from the sun. So you

42:04.880 --> 42:10.400
 have to have both the possibility of changing, but also the possible, a useful degree of stability.

42:10.400 --> 42:16.960
 And we know at that very, very broad level, physics can tell you that it's conceivable.

42:17.680 --> 42:23.600
 If you want to know what actually, what, what's, what, what really happened, what really can

42:23.600 --> 42:27.600
 happen, then you have to, then you have to work about to go to chemistry. If you have, if you

42:27.600 --> 42:32.240
 want to know what actually happened, then you really have to consult the fossil record and

42:32.240 --> 42:42.720
 biologists and so, but, but it's, so these, these ways of addressing the issue are complementary

42:42.720 --> 42:52.320
 in a sense. They, they, they, they use different kinds of concepts. They use different languages

42:52.320 --> 42:56.960
 and they address different kinds of questions, but they're, they're not inconsistent. They're just

42:56.960 --> 43:02.800
 complementary. It's kind of interesting to think about those early fluctuations

43:03.600 --> 43:11.040
 as our earliest ancestors. Yes, that's right. So it's far, it's amazing to think that, you know,

43:13.040 --> 43:24.400
 this is the modern answer to the, or the modern version of what the Hindu philosophers had that

43:24.400 --> 43:30.800
 art thou. If you ask what, okay, that, those, those little quantum fluctuations in the early

43:30.800 --> 43:40.800
 universe are the seeds out of which complexity, including plausibly humans really evolve. You

43:40.800 --> 43:47.680
 don't need anything else. That brings up the question of asking for a friend here. If there's,

43:47.680 --> 43:57.760
 you know, other pockets of complexity, commonly called as alien intelligent civilizations out

43:57.760 --> 44:05.600
 there. Well, we don't know for sure, but I, I have a strong suspicion that the answer is yes,

44:05.600 --> 44:16.480
 because the, the one case we do have at hand to study here on earth, we sort of know what the

44:16.480 --> 44:21.520
 conditions were that were helpful to life, the right kind of temperature, the right kind of star

44:21.520 --> 44:26.000
 that, that keeps maintains that temperature for a long time, the liquid environment of water.

44:28.320 --> 44:35.920
 And once those conditions emerged on earth, which was roughly four and a half billion years ago,

44:35.920 --> 44:45.360
 it wasn't very long before what we call life started to leave relics. So we can find forms of

44:45.360 --> 44:51.440
 life, primitive forms of life that are almost as old as the earth itself in the sense that once the

44:51.440 --> 45:00.320
 earth became recent, it was, was turned from a, a very hot boiling thing and cooled off into a solid

45:00.320 --> 45:05.760
 mass with, with water life emerged very, very quickly. So, so it seems that these general

45:05.760 --> 45:18.320
 conditions for life are enough to, to make it happen relatively quickly. Now, the other lesson

45:18.320 --> 45:24.560
 I would, I think that one can draw from this one example, it's dangerous to, to draw lessons from

45:24.560 --> 45:32.720
 one example, but that's all we've got. And that, that the emergence of intelligent life is a different

45:32.720 --> 45:41.760
 issue altogether. It, that took a long time and seems to have been pretty contingent.

45:43.360 --> 45:51.360
 The, you know, the, for a long time, well, for most, most of the history of life, it was single

45:51.360 --> 46:00.800
 celled things, you know, even multicellular life only rose about 600 million years ago so much

46:00.800 --> 46:10.320
 after, you know, so, and the, the, and then intelligence is kind of a luxury, you know,

46:10.320 --> 46:20.080
 a few things. Many more kinds of creatures have big stomachs and then big brains and,

46:20.080 --> 46:25.920
 in fact, most, most, most have no brains at all in any reasonable sense that then,

46:25.920 --> 46:31.920
 and the dinosaurs ruled for a long, long time and some of them were pretty smart, but they,

46:32.720 --> 46:37.520
 they were at best bird brains because, you know, birds came from the dinosaurs and,

46:38.880 --> 46:45.120
 and, and it could have stayed that way, you know, and then human, and the emergence of humans was

46:45.120 --> 46:52.000
 very contingent and kind of a very, very recent development on evolutionary time scales. And

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
 you can argue about the level of human intelligence, but it's, you know, I think it's

46:56.000 --> 47:00.560
 very impressive. That's what we're talking about. And it's very, it's very impressive and, and

47:00.560 --> 47:09.920
 can ask these kinds of questions and discuss them intelligently. The, so I guess my, so this is a

47:09.920 --> 47:24.080
 long winded answer or justification of my feeling is that the conditions for life in some form are

47:25.680 --> 47:31.760
 probably satisfied in many, many places around the universe, even, and even within our galaxy.

47:31.760 --> 47:39.120
 I'm not so sure about the emergence of intelligent life or the emergence of technological

47:40.240 --> 47:47.360
 civilizations. That, that, that seems much more, much more contingent and special. And

47:48.160 --> 47:55.360
 we might, it's conceivable to me that we're the only example in the galaxy. Although, yeah,

47:55.360 --> 47:59.440
 I don't know one way or the other. I have different opinions on different days of the week.

47:59.440 --> 48:06.320
 But one of the things that worries me in, in the spirit of being humble, that our particular

48:06.320 --> 48:13.600
 kind of intelligence is not very special. So there's all kinds of different intelligences.

48:13.600 --> 48:20.960
 And even more broadly, there could be many different kinds of life. So the basic definition,

48:20.960 --> 48:26.400
 and I just had, I think somebody that you know, Sarah Walker, I just had a very long conversation

48:26.400 --> 48:33.200
 with her about even just the very basic question of trying to define what is life from a physics

48:33.200 --> 48:38.080
 perspective. Even that question within itself, I think one of the most fundamental questions

48:38.080 --> 48:45.040
 in science and physics and everything is just trying to get a hold, trying to get some universal

48:45.040 --> 48:50.320
 laws around the ideas of what is life. Because that kind of unlocks a bunch of things around

48:50.320 --> 48:53.280
 life, intelligence, consciousness, all those kinds of things.

48:53.280 --> 48:56.800
 I agree with you in a sense, but I think that's a dangerous question because

48:59.440 --> 49:05.680
 the answer can't be any more precise than the question. And the question what is life

49:07.840 --> 49:13.280
 kind of assumes that we have a definition of life and that it's a natural phenomena that

49:13.280 --> 49:17.520
 can be distinguished. But really, there are edge cases like viruses and

49:17.520 --> 49:26.720
 some people would like to say that electrons have consciousness. So you can't, if you really have

49:26.720 --> 49:35.120
 fuzzy concepts, it's very hard to reach precise kinds of scientific answers. But I think there's

49:35.120 --> 49:42.240
 a very fruitful question that's adjacent to it, which has been pursued in different forms for

49:42.240 --> 49:50.400
 quite a while and is now becoming very sophisticated in reaching in new directions. And that is,

49:51.040 --> 49:58.960
 what are the states of matter that are possible? So in high school or grade school, you learn

49:58.960 --> 50:06.480
 about solids, liquids, and gases, but that really just scratches the surface of different ways that

50:06.480 --> 50:16.080
 are distinguishable that matter can form into macroscopically different meaningful patterns

50:16.080 --> 50:20.800
 that we call phasism. And then there are precise definitions of what we mean by phasism matter

50:21.520 --> 50:28.320
 and that have been worked out fruitful over the decades. And we're discovering new states of

50:28.320 --> 50:34.240
 matter all the time and kind of having to work at what we mean by matter. We're discovering the

50:34.240 --> 50:45.040
 capabilities of matter to organize in interesting ways. And some of them, like liquid crystals,

50:45.920 --> 50:52.240
 are important ingredients of life, our cell membranes are liquid crystals. And that's very

50:52.240 --> 50:58.800
 important to the way they work. Recently, there's been a development in where we're talking about

50:58.800 --> 51:08.080
 states of matter that are not static, but that have dynamics, that have characteristic patterns

51:08.080 --> 51:13.120
 not only in space, but in time. These are called time crystals. And that's been a development

51:13.120 --> 51:24.480
 that's just in the last decade or so. It's really flourishing. And so, is there a state of matter

51:24.480 --> 51:33.680
 or a group of states of matter that corresponds to life? Maybe, but the answer can't be any

51:33.680 --> 51:39.760
 more definite than the question. I mean, I gotta push back on the, those are just words.

51:39.760 --> 51:47.920
 I mean, I disagree with you. The question points to a direction. The answer might be able to be

51:47.920 --> 51:56.640
 more precise than the question, because just as you're saying that we could be discovering

51:56.640 --> 52:02.160
 certain characteristics and patterns that are associated with a certain type of matter,

52:02.720 --> 52:12.480
 macroscopically speaking. And that we can then be able to post facto say, let's assign the word

52:12.480 --> 52:19.680
 life to this kind of matter. I agree with that completely. So, it's not a disagreement.

52:19.680 --> 52:28.320
 It's very frequent in physics or in science that words that are in common use get refined and

52:28.320 --> 52:33.680
 reprocessed into scientific terms. That's happened for things like force and energy.

52:33.680 --> 52:44.480
 And so, in a way, we find out what the useful definition is or symmetry, for instance. And

52:44.480 --> 52:49.520
 the common usage may be quite different from the scientific usage, but the scientific usage

52:50.560 --> 52:57.280
 is special and takes on a life of its own. And we find out what the useful version of it is,

52:57.280 --> 53:09.280
 what the fruitful version of it is. So, in that spirit, I think if we can identify

53:10.720 --> 53:21.120
 states of matter or linked states of matter that can carry on processes of self reproduction

53:21.120 --> 53:32.960
 and development and information processing, we might be tempted to classify those things as

53:32.960 --> 53:41.360
 life. What can I ask you about the craziest one, which is the one we know maybe least about,

53:41.360 --> 53:45.520
 which is consciousness, is it possible that there are certain kinds of matter would be able to

53:45.520 --> 53:55.440
 classify as conscious meaning. So, there's the panpsychist, right, with the philosophers who

53:55.440 --> 54:02.320
 kind of try to imply that all matter has some degree of consciousness and you can almost construct

54:02.320 --> 54:10.240
 like a physics of consciousness. Again, we're in such early days of this, but nevertheless,

54:10.240 --> 54:16.320
 it seems useful to talk about it. Is there some sense from a physics perspective to make sense

54:16.320 --> 54:24.720
 of consciousness? Is there some hope? Well, again, consciousness is imprecise, a very imprecise word

54:24.720 --> 54:30.560
 and loaded with connotations that I think we should, we don't want to start a scientific

54:30.560 --> 54:39.440
 analysis with that, I don't think. It's often been important in science to start with simple

54:39.440 --> 54:47.440
 cases and work up consciousness. I think what most people think of when you talk about consciousness

54:47.440 --> 54:55.840
 is, okay, what am I doing in the world? This is my experience. I have a rich inner life and

54:55.840 --> 55:02.560
 experience. And where is that in the equations? And I think that's a great question, a great,

55:02.560 --> 55:10.880
 great question. And actually, I think I'm gearing up to try to address that in coming years.

55:10.880 --> 55:15.760
 One version of asking that question, just as you said now, is what is the simplest

55:16.560 --> 55:22.000
 formulation of that to study? I think I'm much more comfortable with the idea of studying

55:22.000 --> 55:27.680
 self awareness as opposed to consciousness, because that sort of gets rid of the mystical

55:27.680 --> 55:38.160
 aura of the thing. And self awareness is in simple, I think contiguous, at least

55:38.880 --> 55:46.400
 with ideas about feedback. So if you have a system that looks at its own state and responds to it,

55:46.960 --> 55:55.520
 that's a kind of self awareness. And more sophisticated versions could be like in

55:55.520 --> 56:01.280
 information processing things, computers that look into their own internal state and do something

56:01.280 --> 56:09.840
 about it. And I think that could also be done in neural nets. This is called recurrent neural

56:09.840 --> 56:17.200
 nets, which are hard to understand and kind of a frontier. So I think understanding those

56:17.200 --> 56:31.280
 and gradually building up a kind of profound ability to conceptualize different levels of

56:31.280 --> 56:35.680
 self awareness. What do you have to not know? And what do you have to know? And when do you know

56:35.680 --> 56:42.000
 that you don't know it? What do you think you know that you don't really know? I think

56:42.000 --> 56:49.200
 clarifying those issues, when we clarify those issues and get a rich theory around

56:50.480 --> 56:57.280
 self awareness, I think that will illuminate the questions about consciousness in a way that

56:58.160 --> 57:04.160
 scratching your chin and talking about qualia and blah, blah, blah, blah is never going to do.

57:04.160 --> 57:09.040
 Well, I also have a different approach to the whole thing. So there's from a robotics perspective,

57:09.040 --> 57:14.960
 you can engineer things that exhibit qualities of consciousness without understanding

57:17.600 --> 57:24.640
 the how things work. And from that perspective, you, it's like a backdoor,

57:25.520 --> 57:28.640
 like enter through the psychology door. Precisely.

57:28.640 --> 57:32.560
 That are causing a science door. I think we're on the same wavelength here. I think that,

57:32.560 --> 57:40.880
 and let me just add one comment, which is, I think we should try to understand consciousness

57:41.760 --> 57:52.880
 as we experience it in evolutionary terms and ask ourselves, why? Why does it happen?

57:52.880 --> 57:56.000
 This thing seems useful. Why is it useful? Why is it useful?

57:56.000 --> 58:00.720
 Question. We've got a conscious eye watch here.

58:01.440 --> 58:03.680
 Interesting question. Thank you, Siri. Okay.

58:07.920 --> 58:08.880
 I'll get back to you later.

58:12.960 --> 58:19.360
 And I think what we're, I'm morally certain that what's going to emerge from analyzing

58:19.360 --> 58:28.400
 recurrent neural nets and robotic design and advanced computer design is that having this kind

58:28.400 --> 58:37.680
 of looking at the internal state in a structured way that, that doesn't look at everything.

58:37.680 --> 58:43.040
 It's kind of, it's encapsulated, looks at highly processed information and very selective and makes

58:43.040 --> 58:47.520
 choices without knowing how they're made. So there'll also be an unconscious. I think that,

58:47.520 --> 58:54.400
 that is going to be, turn out to be really essential to doing efficient information processing.

58:55.360 --> 59:05.760
 And that's why it evolved because it's, it's, it's helpful in, because brains come at a high cost.

59:07.200 --> 59:09.280
 So there has to be, there has to be a good why.

59:09.280 --> 59:12.560
 And there's a reason, yeah, they're rare in evolution.

59:12.560 --> 59:20.640
 And big brains are rare in evolution. And they, they come at a big cost. You mean, if you, you,

59:20.640 --> 59:30.480
 you, they, they, they have high metabolic demands. They require, you know, very active lifestyle,

59:30.480 --> 59:38.960
 warm bloodedness in, and take, take away from the ability to support metabolism of digestion.

59:38.960 --> 59:44.160
 And so it's, it's, it comes at a high cost. It has to, it has to pay back.

59:44.160 --> 59:48.480
 Yeah. I think it has a lot of value in social interaction. So I actually, I'm spending the

59:48.480 --> 59:57.440
 rest of the day today and with our friends that are, our legged friends in robotic form at Boston

59:57.440 --> 1:00:06.080
 Dynamics. And I think, so my probably biggest passion is human robot interaction. And it,

1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:10.960
 it seems that consciousness from the perspective of the robot is very useful

1:00:11.840 --> 1:00:14.880
 to improve the human robot interaction experience.

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:20.640
 The first, the display of consciousness, but then to me, there's a gray area between the

1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:25.120
 display of consciousness and consciousness itself. If you think of consciousness from an

1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:29.760
 evolutionary perspective, it seems like a useful tool in human communication. So.

1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:37.280
 Yes. It's certainly, well, whatever consciousness is will turn out to be. I think addressing it

1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:44.560
 through its use and working up from simple cases and also working up from engineering experience

1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:52.640
 in trying to do efficient computation, including efficient management of social interactions

1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:59.520
 is going to really shed light on these questions. As I said, in a way that sort of musing abstractly

1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:05.280
 about consciousness never would. So as I mentioned, I talked to Sarah Walker and first of all, she

1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:11.520
 says hi, spoke with a highly review. One of her concerns about physics and physicists and humans

1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:19.280
 is that we may not fully understand the system that we're inside of, meaning

1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:27.040
 like there may be limits to the kind of physics we do in trying to understand the system of which

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:36.800
 we're part of. So like the observer is also the observed. In that sense, it seems like the

1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:44.800
 our tools of understanding the world. I mean, this is mostly centered around the questions of

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:51.120
 what is life, trying to understand the patterns that are characteristic of life and intelligence,

1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:58.080
 all those kinds of things. We're not using the right tools because we're in the system. Is there

1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:07.520
 something that resonates with you there? Well, yes, we do have limitations, of course,

1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:15.120
 in the amount of information we can process. On the other hand, we can get help from our

1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:23.200
 silicon friends. And we can get help from all kinds of instruments that make up for our perceptual

1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:31.840
 deficits. And we have to, and we can use at a conceptual level, we can use different kinds

1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:38.960
 of concepts to address different kinds of questions. So I'm not sure exactly what problem

1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:45.840
 she's talking about. It's a problem akin to an organism living in a 2G plane, trying to

1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:53.280
 understand a three dimensional world. Well, we can do that. In fact, for practical purposes,

1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:58.720
 most of our experience is two dimensional. It's hard to move vertically. And yet we've produced

1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:04.080
 conceptually a three dimensional symmetry. And in fact, four dimensional space time.

1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:12.880
 So, by thinking in appropriate ways and using instruments and getting consistent

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:24.480
 accounts and rich accounts, we find out what concepts are necessary. And I don't see any end

1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:32.320
 inside of the process or any showstoppers because let me give you an example. I mean,

1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:38.960
 for instance, QCD, our theory of the strong interaction has nice equations, which I helped

1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:47.360
 to discover. What's QCD? Quantum chromodynamics. So it's our theory of the strong interaction,

1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:52.960
 the interaction that is responsible for nuclear physics. So it's the interaction that governs

1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:59.920
 how quarks and gluons interact with each other and make protons and neutrons and all the strong,

1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:07.840
 the related particles and many things in physics. That's one of the four basic forces of nature,

1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:17.520
 as we presently understand it. And so we have beautiful equations, which we can test

1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:25.840
 in very special circumstances using at high energies, at accelerators. So we

1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:30.960
 be certain that these equations are correct. Prizes are given for it. And so people try

1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:43.040
 to knock it down and they can't. But the situations in which we can calculate the

1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:51.360
 consequences of these equations are very limited. So for instance, no one has been able to demonstrate

1:04:51.360 --> 1:05:00.320
 that this theory, which is built on quarks and gluons, which you don't observe,

1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:05.040
 actually produces protons and neutrons and the things you do observe. This is called the

1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:11.840
 problem of confinement. So no one's been able to prove that analytically in a way that a human

1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:18.960
 can understand. On the other hand, we can take these equations to a computer, to gigantic computers

1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:29.520
 and compute. And by God, you get the world from it. So these equations in a way that we don't

1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:38.960
 understand in terms of human concepts, we can't do the calculations, but our machines can do them.

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:46.000
 So with the help of what I like to call our silicon friends and their descendants in the future,

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:52.320
 we can understand in a different way that allows us to understand more.

1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:59.120
 But I don't think we'll ever, no human is ever going to be able to solve those equations in

1:05:59.120 --> 1:06:10.880
 the same way. But I think that when we find limitations to our natural abilities, we can try

1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:16.160
 to find workarounds. And sometimes that's appropriate concepts. Sometimes it's appropriate

1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:25.040
 instruments. Sometimes it's a combination of the two. But I think it's premature to get

1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:35.200
 defeatist about it. I don't see any logical contradiction or paradox or limitation that

1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:41.280
 that will bring this process to a halt. Well, I think the idea is to continue thinking outside

1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:46.560
 of the box in different directions, meaning just like how the math allows us to think in multiple

1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:55.600
 dimensions outside of our perception system, sort of thinking, coming up with new tools of

1:06:55.600 --> 1:07:03.280
 mathematical computation or all those kinds of things to take different perspectives on our

1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:09.120
 universe. Well, I'm all for that. And I kind of have even elevated it into a principle, which is

1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:17.520
 of complementarity, following Bohr that you need different ways of thinking even about the same

1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:23.200
 things in order to do justice to their reality and answer different kinds of questions about them.

1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:29.520
 I mean, we've several times alluded to the fact that human beings are hard to understand

1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:36.960
 and the concepts that you use to understand human beings, if you want to prescribe drugs for them

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:44.960
 or see what's going to happen if they move very fast or get exposed to radiation. And so that

1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:53.520
 requires one kind of thinking that's very physical based on the fact that the materials that we're

1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:58.720
 made out of. On the other hand, if you want to understand how a person is going to behave in

1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:06.880
 a different kind of situation, you need entirely different concepts from psychology. And there's

1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:11.040
 nothing wrong with that. You can have very different ways of addressing the same material

1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:16.720
 that are useful for different purposes, right? Can you describe this idea which is fascinating of

1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:25.840
 complementarity a little bit, sort of, first of all, what state is the principle? What is it?

1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:31.360
 And second of all, what are good examples starting from quantum mechanics? You used to mention

1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:35.200
 psychology. Let's talk about this more. It's really one in your new book, one of the most

1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:40.880
 fascinating ideas, actually. I think it's a wonderful, yeah, it's sort of, to me, it's,

1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:46.320
 well, it's the culminating chapter of the book. And I think since the whole book is about the

1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:53.600
 big lessons or big takeaways from profound understanding of the physical world that we've

1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:59.120
 understood, that we've achieved, including that it's mysterious in some ways, the,

1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:08.320
 this was the final overarching lesson, complementarity. And

1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:20.480
 it's a approach. So unlike some of these other things, which are just facts about the world,

1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:25.760
 like the world is both big and small in different sessions, and is big, but we're not small,

1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:31.440
 things we talked about earlier, and the fact that the universe is comprehensible and how

1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:37.760
 complexity could emerge from simplicity. And so those things are, in some, in the broad sense,

1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:44.240
 facts about the world, complementarity is more an attitude towards the world that is encouraged

1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:55.760
 by the facts about the world. And it's the idea, the concept of the approach that or the realization

1:09:55.760 --> 1:10:04.400
 that it can be appropriate and useful and inevitable and unavoidable to use very different

1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:14.080
 descriptions of the same object or the same system or the same situation to answer different kinds of

1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:23.520
 questions that may be very different and even mutually uninterpretable, imutably

1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:31.920
 incomprehensible. But both correct somehow. But both correct and sources of different kinds of

1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:37.680
 insight. Which is so weird. Yeah, well. But it seems to work in so many cases. It works in many cases,

1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:47.520
 and I think it's a deep fact about the world and how we should approach it. It's most rigorous form

1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:55.280
 where it's actually a theorem, if quantum mechanics is correct, occurs in quantum mechanics,

1:10:55.280 --> 1:11:04.000
 where the primary description of the world is in terms of wave functions. But let's not talk

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:11.360
 about the world. Let's just talk about a particle, an electron. It's the primary description of that

1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:20.240
 electron is its wave function. And the wave function can be used to predict where it's

1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:25.600
 going to be. And if you observe, it'll be in different places with different probabilities.

1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:32.560
 Or how fast it's moving. And it'll also be moving in different ways with different probabilities.

1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:39.600
 That's what quantum mechanics says. And you can predict either set of probabilities. What's going

1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:49.840
 to happen if I make an observation of the position or the velocity. So the wave function gives you

1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:55.520
 ways of doing both of those. But to do it, to get those predictions, you have to process the wave

1:11:55.520 --> 1:12:01.360
 function in different ways. You process it one way for position and a different way for momentum.

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:09.360
 And those ways are mathematically incompatible. It's like you have a stone and you can sculpt it

1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:18.960
 into Venus de Milo where you can sculpt it into David, but you can't do both. And that's an example

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:24.560
 of complementarity. But to answer different kinds of questions, you have to analyze the system in

1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:32.640
 different ways that are mutually incompatible, but both valid to answer different kinds of questions.

1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:39.520
 So in that case, it's a theorem. But I think it's a much more widespread phenomena that applies to

1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:46.640
 many cases where we can't prove it as a theorem. But it's a piece of wisdom, if you like, and

1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:57.280
 it appears to be a very important insight. And if you ignore it, you can get very confused and

1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:09.840
 misguided. Do you think this is a useful hack for ideas that we don't fully understand?

1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:17.520
 Or is this somehow a fundamental property of all or many ideas that you can take

1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:21.600
 multiple perspectives and they're both true? Well, I think it's both.

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:28.800
 So it's both the answer to all questions. That's right. It's not either or. It's both.

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:36.720
 It's paralyzing to think that we live in a world that's fundamentally surrounded by complementary

1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:46.240
 ideas. Because we somehow want to attach ourselves to absolute truths. And absolute

1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:50.000
 truths certainly don't like the idea of complementarity.

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:55.680
 Yes. Einstein was very uncomfortable with complementarity. In a broad sense, the famous

1:13:55.680 --> 1:14:06.800
 Bohr Einstein debates revolved around this question of whether the complementarity that is a foundational

1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:17.280
 feature of quantum mechanics as we have it was, is a permanent feature of the universe and our

1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:26.400
 description of nature. And so far, quantum mechanics wins and it's gone from triumph to triumph.

1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:34.080
 Whether complementarity is rock bottom, I guess you can never be sure. But it looks awfully good

1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:40.400
 and it's been very successful. And certainly, complementarity has been extremely useful and

1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:51.200
 fruitful in that domain, including some of Einstein's attempts to challenge it with

1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:57.120
 like the famous Einstein Podolsky Rosen experiment turned out to be confirmations

1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:05.040
 that have been useful in themselves. But so thinking about these things was fruitful,

1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:19.840
 but not in the way that Einstein hoped. So as I said, in the case of quantum mechanics and this

1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:29.120
 dilemma or dichotomy between processing the wave function in different ways,

1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:32.960
 it's a theorem. They're mutually incompatible and that the physical correlate of that is the

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:38.480
 Heisenberg uncertainty principle that you can't have position and momentum determined at once.

1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:50.640
 But in other cases, like one that I like to think about is or like to point out as an example is

1:15:50.640 --> 1:16:05.680
 free will and determinism. It's much less of a theorem and more a kind of way of thinking about

1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:15.840
 things that I think is reassuring and avoids a lot of unnecessary quarreling and confusion.

1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:20.400
 The quarreling I'm okay with and the confusion I'm okay with, I mean, people debate about difficult

1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:27.280
 ideas. But the question is whether it could be almost a fundamental truth. I think it is a

1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:33.840
 fundamental truth. That free will is both an illusion and not. Yes, I think that's correct.

1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:42.480
 The reason why people say quantum mechanics is weird and complementarity is a big part of that.

1:16:42.480 --> 1:16:52.400
 To say that our actual whole world is weird, the whole hierarchy of the universe is weird in this

1:16:52.400 --> 1:17:04.800
 kind of particular way, and it's quite profound, but it's also humbling because it's like we're

1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:10.000
 never going to be on sturdy ground in the way that humans like to be. It's like you have to

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:20.800
 embrace that, well, this whole thing is like unsteady mess. It's one of many lessons in humility

1:17:21.920 --> 1:17:29.920
 that we run into in profound understanding of the world. I mean, the Copernican revolution

1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:38.240
 was one that the earth is not the center of the universe. Darwinian evolution is another that humans

1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:56.880
 are not the pinnacle of God's creation. The apparent result of deep understanding of physical

1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:07.600
 reality that the mind emerges from matter and there's no call on special life forces or souls.

1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:16.240
 These are all lessons in humility, and I actually find complementarity a

1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:32.560
 liberating concept. There's a story about Dr. Johnson and he's talking with Boswell,

1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:40.560
 and they were discussing a sermon that they'd both heard, and the sort of culmination of the

1:18:40.560 --> 1:18:48.400
 sermon was the speaker saying, I accept the universe, and Dr. Johnson said, well, he'd damn

1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:56.960
 well better, and there's a certain joy in accepting the universe because it's mind expanding,

1:18:56.960 --> 1:19:13.040
 and to me, complementarity also suggests tolerance, suggests opportunities for understanding

1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:24.320
 things in different ways that add to, rather than detract from understanding.

1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:33.440
 I think it's an opportunity for mind expansion and demanding that there's only one way to think

1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:38.640
 about things can be very limiting. On the free will one, that's a trippy one though.

1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:49.360
 To think like I am the decider of my own actions and at the same time I'm not is tricky to think

1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:55.840
 about, but it does seem to be some kind of profound truth in that. Well, I think it is tied

1:19:55.840 --> 1:20:01.600
 up, it will turn out to be tied up when we understand things better with these issues of

1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:07.920
 self awareness and where we get what we perceive as making choices, what does that really mean,

1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:15.120
 and what's going on under the hood, but I'm speculating about a future understanding that's

1:20:15.120 --> 1:20:22.320
 not in place at present. Your sense there will always be, as you dig into the self awareness

1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:26.560
 thing, there'll always be some places where complementarity is going to show up.

1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:32.720
 Oh, definitely. Yeah. I mean, there will be, how should I say, there'll be kind of a God's

1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:40.720
 eye view, which sees everything that's going on in the computer or the brain, and then there's

1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:49.360
 the brain's own view or the central processor or whatever it is, what we call the self, the

1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:54.480
 consciousness, that's only aware of a very small part of it. And those are very different.

1:20:56.320 --> 1:21:02.800
 So the God's eye view can be deterministic while the self view

1:21:02.800 --> 1:21:13.760
 sees free will. I'm pretty sure that's how it's going to work out, actually. But as it stands,

1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:19.120
 free will is a concept that we definitely, at least I feel I definitely experience,

1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:24.400
 I can choose to do one thing than another, and other people I think are sufficiently similar

1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:33.680
 to me that I trust that they feel the same way. And it's an essential concept in psychology and

1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:43.840
 law and so forth. But at the same time, I think that mind emerges from matter, and that there's

1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:50.960
 an alternative description of matter that's up to subtleties about quantum mechanics,

1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:55.120
 which I don't think are relevant here, really is deterministic.

1:21:55.920 --> 1:22:00.720
 Let me ask you about some particles. Okay. First, the absurd question,

1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:07.280
 almost like a question that Plato would ask, what is the smallest thing in the universe?

1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:16.800
 As far as we know, the fundamental particles out of which we build our most successful

1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:24.480
 description of nature are points. They have zero, they don't have any internal structure.

1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:36.400
 So that's as small as can be. So what does that mean operationally? That means that they obey

1:22:36.400 --> 1:22:46.720
 equations that describe entities that are singular concentrations of energy, momentum,

1:22:46.720 --> 1:22:52.800
 angular momentum, the things that particles have, but localized at individual points.

1:22:53.360 --> 1:23:02.000
 Now, that mathematical structure is only revealed partially in the world because to

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:10.080
 process the wave function in a way that accesses information about the precise position of things,

1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:15.840
 you have to apply a lot of energy, and that's an idealization that you can apply infinite

1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:21.920
 amount of energy to determine a precise position. But at the mathematical level,

1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:25.760
 we build the world out of particles that are points.

1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:30.480
 So do they actually exist? And what are we talking about? So let me ask,

1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:37.760
 sort of, do quarks exist? Yes. Do electrons exist? Yes. Do photons exist? Yes.

1:23:37.760 --> 1:23:43.280
 But what does it mean for them to exist? Okay. So, well, the hard answer to that,

1:23:43.280 --> 1:23:53.920
 the precise answer is that we construct the world out of equations that contain entities that are

1:23:53.920 --> 1:24:04.400
 reproducible, that exist in vast numbers throughout the universe, that have definite properties of

1:24:05.200 --> 1:24:16.080
 mass, spin, and a few others, that we call electrons. And what an electron is, is defined

1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:24.160
 by the equations that it satisfies, theoretically, and we find that there are many, many exemplars of

1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:32.560
 that entity in the physical world. So in the case of electrons, we can, you know,

1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:38.400
 isolate them and study them in individual ones in great detail. We can check that they all

1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:48.240
 actually are identical. And that's why chemistry works. And yes, so in that case,

1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:54.880
 it's very tangible. Similarly with photons, you can study them individually, the units of light.

1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:02.160
 And nowadays, it's very practical to study individual photons and determine their

1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:10.320
 spin and their other basic properties and check out the equations in great detail.

1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:19.520
 For quarks and gluons, which are the other two main ingredients of our model of matter,

1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:24.960
 that's so successful, it's a little more complicated because the quarks and gluons

1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:32.640
 that appear in our equations don't appear directly as particles you can isolate

1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:41.840
 and study individually. They always occur within what are called bound states or

1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:48.080
 structures like protons. A proton, roughly speaking, is composed of three quarks and a

1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:53.680
 lot of gluons. But we can detect them in a remarkably direct way actually nowadays.

1:25:53.680 --> 1:26:00.160
 Whereas at relatively low energies, the behavior of quarks is complicated,

1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:06.640
 at high energies, they can propagate through space relatively freely

1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:14.640
 for a while. And we can see their tracks. So ultimately, they get recaptured into protons

1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:21.680
 and other mesons and funny things. But for a short time, they propagate freely. And while that

1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:30.960
 happens, we can take snapshots and see their manifestations. Actually, this kind of thing

1:26:30.960 --> 1:26:35.600
 is exactly what I got the Nobel Prize for, predicting that this would work. And similarly

1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:42.480
 for gluons, although you can't isolate them as individual particles and study them in the same

1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:52.320
 way we study electrons, you can use them theoretically as entities out of which you

1:26:52.960 --> 1:27:02.880
 build tangible things that we actually do observe. But also, you can, at accelerators,

1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:13.360
 at high energy, you can liberate them for brief periods of time and get convincing evidence

1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:18.800
 and you can get convincing evidence that they were there and have the properties that we wanted

1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:22.720
 them to have. Can we talk about asymptotic freedom, this very idea that you want the

1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:32.720
 Nobel Prize for? Yeah. So it describes a very weird effect to me. The weird in the following

1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:42.480
 way. So the way I think of most forces or interactions, the closer you are, the stronger

1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:53.840
 the effect, the stronger the force. With quarks, the closer they are, the less the strong interaction.

1:27:53.840 --> 1:28:00.480
 And in fact, they basically act like free particles when they're very close.

1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:05.600
 That's right. But this requires a huge amount of energy. Can you describe me,

1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:16.000
 why? How does this even work? How weird it is? A proper description must bring in

1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:26.480
 quantum mechanics and relativity. So a proper description and equations. So a proper description

1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:34.560
 really is probably more than we have time for and require quite a bit of patience on your part.

1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:41.040
 How does relativity come into play? Wait. Oh, relativity is important because

1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:52.560
 when we talk about trying to think about short distances, we have to think about

1:28:52.560 --> 1:28:59.120
 a very large momenta and very large momenta are connected to very large energy in relativity.

1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:04.800
 And so the connection between how things behave at short distances and how things behave at high

1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:13.280
 energy really is connected through relativity in sort of a slightly backhanded way. Quantum

1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:23.120
 mechanics indicates that short to get to analyze short distances, you need to bring in probes that

1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:31.200
 carry a lot of momentum. This again is related to uncertainty because it's the fact that you

1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:36.960
 have to bring in a lot of momentum that interferes with the possibility of determining

1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:41.840
 position and momentum at the same time. If you want to determine position,

1:29:41.840 --> 1:29:46.000
 you have to use instruments that bring in a lot of momentum. And because of that,

1:29:47.200 --> 1:29:51.200
 those same instruments can't also measure momentum because they're disturbing the momentum.

1:29:53.520 --> 1:29:59.520
 And then the momentum brings in energy. So that there's also the effect that asymptotic freedom

1:29:59.520 --> 1:30:12.560
 comes from the possibility of spontaneously making quarks and gluons for short amounts of time that

1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:22.320
 fluctuate into existence and out of existence. And the fact that that can be done with a very

1:30:22.320 --> 1:30:28.160
 little amount of energy and uncertainty and energy translates into uncertainty and time. So if you

1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:36.960
 do that for a short time, you can do that. Well, it's all comes in a package. So I told you it

1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:44.160
 would take a while to really explain. But the results can be understood. I mean,

1:30:44.160 --> 1:30:54.320
 we can state the results pretty simply, I think. So in everyday life, we do encounter some forces

1:30:54.320 --> 1:31:00.480
 that increase with distance and kind of turn off at short distances. That's the way rubber bands

1:31:00.480 --> 1:31:09.840
 work, if you think about it. If you pull them hard, they resist, but they get flabby if the rubber

1:31:09.840 --> 1:31:18.560
 band is not pulled. And so there are that can happen in the physical world. But what's really

1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:23.440
 difficult is to see how that could be a fundamental force that's consistent with everything else we

1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:33.440
 know. And that's what asymptotic freedom is. It says that there's a very particular kind

1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:39.120
 of fundamental force that involves special particles called gluons with very special

1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:47.520
 properties that enables that kind of behavior. So at the time we did our work, there were

1:31:47.520 --> 1:31:54.320
 experimental indications that quarks and gluons did have this kind of property, but

1:31:55.280 --> 1:32:01.440
 there were no equations that were capable of capturing it. And we found the equations and

1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:07.360
 showed how they work and showed how they that they were basically unique. And this led to a

1:32:07.360 --> 1:32:12.880
 complete theory of how the strong interaction works, which is the quantum chromodynamics

1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:24.160
 we mentioned earlier. So that's the phenomenon that quarks and gluons interact very, very

1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:29.680
 weakly when they're close together. That's connected through relativity with the fact

1:32:29.680 --> 1:32:36.240
 that they also interact very, very weakly at high energies. So at high energies,

1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:42.560
 the simplicity of the fundamental interaction gets revealed. At the time we did our work,

1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:48.720
 the clues were very subtle, but nowadays at what are now high energy accelerators,

1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:53.520
 it's all obvious. So we would have had a much, well, somebody would have had a much easier time.

1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:59.200
 20 years later, looking at the data, you can sort of see the quarks and gluons. As I mentioned,

1:32:59.200 --> 1:33:05.040
 they leave these short tracks that would have been much, much easier. But from fundamental

1:33:05.040 --> 1:33:10.720
 we, from fundamental, from indirect clues, we were able to piece together enough to make

1:33:11.440 --> 1:33:15.680
 that behavior a prediction rather than a post diction, right?

1:33:15.680 --> 1:33:17.840
 So it becomes obvious at high energies.

1:33:17.840 --> 1:33:24.080
 It becomes very obvious. When we first did this work, it was frontiers of high energy

1:33:24.080 --> 1:33:30.960
 physics and at big international conferences, there would always be sessions on testing QCD and

1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:36.960
 whether this proposed description of the strong interaction was in fact correct and so forth.

1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:43.840
 And it was very exciting. But nowadays, the same kind of work,

1:33:44.720 --> 1:33:51.520
 but much more precise with calculations to more accuracy and experiments that are much more

1:33:51.520 --> 1:34:00.240
 precise and comparisons that are very precise. Now it's called calculating backgrounds because

1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:07.520
 people take this for granted and want to see deviations from the theory, which would be

1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:09.680
 which would be the new discoveries.

1:34:09.680 --> 1:34:13.280
 Yeah, the cutting edge becomes a foundation, the foundation becomes boring. Yes.

1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:20.480
 Is there some, for basic explanation purposes, is there something to be said about

1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:27.920
 strong interactions in the context of the strong nuclear force for the attraction

1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:35.280
 between protons and neutrons versus the interaction between quarks within protons itself?

1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:45.600
 Well, quarks and gluons have the same relation basically to nuclear physics as electrons and

1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:56.960
 photons have to atomic and molecular physics. So atoms and photons are the dynamic entities that

1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:02.560
 really come into play in chemistry and atomic physics. Of course, you have to add the atomic

1:35:02.560 --> 1:35:11.360
 nuclei, but those are small and relatively inert, really the dynamical part. And for most purposes

1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:17.120
 of chemistry, you just say that you have this tiny little nucleus, which QCD gives you. Don't

1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:23.360
 worry about it. It's there. The real action is the electrons moving around and exchanging and

1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:34.720
 things like that. But we want it to understand the nucleus too. So atoms are sort of quantum

1:35:34.720 --> 1:35:39.840
 mechanical clouds of electrons held together by electrical forces, which is photons, and then

1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:44.480
 this radiation, which is another aspect of photons. That's where all the fun happens is

1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:48.240
 the electrons and photons and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, that's right. And the nucleus are

1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:55.360
 kind of the, well, they're necessary, they give the positive charge and most of the mass of matter.

1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:04.160
 But they don't, since they're so heavy, they don't move very much in chemistry. And

1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:09.600
 I'm oversimplifying drastically. They're not contributing much to the interaction.

1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:16.880
 For most purposes in chemistry, you can just idealize them as concentrations of positive mass

1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:27.840
 and charge that you don't have to look inside. But people are curious what's inside. And that was

1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:33.920
 a big thing on the agenda of 20th century physics starting in the 19, well, starting with the 20th

1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:41.040
 century and unfolding throughout of trying to understand what forces held the atomic nucleus

1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:51.200
 together, what it was and so on. Anyway, the story that emerges from QCD is that

1:36:53.040 --> 1:36:57.200
 very similar to the way that, well, broadly similar to the way that

1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:06.960
 clouds of electrons held together by electrical forces give you atoms and ultimately molecules,

1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:17.840
 protons and neutrons are like atoms made now out of quarks, quark clouds held together by

1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:24.560
 gluons, which are like the photons that give the electric forces. But this is giving a different

1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:32.160
 force, the strong force. And the residual forces between protons and neutrons that

1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:41.200
 are left over from the basic binding are like the residual forces between atoms that give molecules,

1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:44.560
 but in the case of protons and neutrons, it gives you atomic nuclei.

1:37:45.360 --> 1:37:52.640
 So again, for definitional purposes, QCD quantum chromodynamics is basically the physics of

1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:59.520
 strong interaction. Yeah, we now understand what I think most physicists would say it's the theory

1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:07.280
 of quarks and gluons and how they interact. But it's a very precise, and I think it's

1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:13.120
 fair to say very beautiful theory based on mathematical symmetry of a high order.

1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:18.800
 And another thing that's beautiful about it is that it's kind of

1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:30.320
 in the same family as electrodynamics, the conceptual structure of the equations are

1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:36.480
 very similar. They're based on having particles that respond to charge in a very symmetric way.

1:38:37.040 --> 1:38:43.040
 In the case of electrodynamics, it's photons that respond to electric charge. In the case of

1:38:43.040 --> 1:38:46.720
 quantum chromodynamics, there are three kinds of charge that we call colors,

1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:51.200
 but they're nothing like colors. They really are like different kinds of charge.

1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:56.480
 But they rhyme with the same kind of, like it's similar kind of dynamics.

1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:02.080
 Similar kind of dynamics. I like to say that QCD is like QED on steroids.

1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:08.000
 And instead of one photon, you have eight gluons. Instead of one charge, you have three color

1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.280
 charges. But there's a strong family resemblance.

1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:18.640
 But the context in which QCD does this thing is it's much higher energies.

1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:22.720
 Like that's where it comes from. Well, it's a stronger force. So that

1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:29.600
 to access how it works and kind of pry things apart, you have to inject more energy.

1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:39.280
 And so that gives us, in some sense, a hint of how things were in the earlier universe.

1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:44.640
 Yeah. Well, in that regard, asymptotic freedom is a tremendous blessing because it means

1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:50.000
 things get simpler at high energy. And the universe was born free.

1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:53.440
 Born free. That's very good. Yes. The universe was born.

1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:58.640
 So in atomic physics, I mean, a similar thing happens in the theory of stars.

1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:07.280
 Stars are hot enough that the interactions between electrons and photons, they're liberated.

1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:11.520
 They don't form atoms anymore. They make a plasma, which in some ways is simpler to understand.

1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:17.120
 You don't have complicated chemistry. And in the early universe, according to QCD,

1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:23.280
 similarly, atomic nuclei dissolved into the constituent quarks and gluons, which are moving

1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:29.920
 around very fast and interacting in relatively simple ways. And so this opened up the early

1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:35.600
 universe to scientific calculation. Can I ask you about some other weird particles

1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:41.920
 that make up our universe? What are axions? And what is the strong CP problem?

1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:47.760
 Okay. So let me start with what the strong CP problem is.

1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:56.240
 First of all, well, C is charge conjugation, which is the transformation,

1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:02.320
 the notional transformation, if you like, that changes all particles into their antiparticles.

1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:11.840
 And the concept of C symmetry, charge conjugation symmetry, is that if you do that,

1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:20.800
 you find the same laws would work. So the laws are symmetric if the behavior that

1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:26.800
 particles exhibit is the same as the behavior you get with all their antiparticles.

1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:37.600
 And P is parity, which is also called spatial inversion. It's basically looking at a mirror

1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:45.920
 universe and saying that the laws that are obeyed in a mirror universe, the mirror images obey the

1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:52.720
 same laws as the sources of their images. There's no way of telling left from right, for instance,

1:41:52.720 --> 1:42:00.640
 that the laws don't distinguish between left and right. Now, in the mid 20th century, people

1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:08.480
 discovered that both of those are not quite true. Really, the equation that the mirror universe,

1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:18.960
 the universe that you see in a mirror is not going to obey the same laws as the

1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:28.240
 universe that we actually interpret. You would be able to tell if you did the right kind of

1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:33.920
 experiments, which was the mirror and which was the real thing. Anyway, that...

1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:37.760
 Just the parity and they show that the parity doesn't necessarily hold.

1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:46.080
 It doesn't quite hold. And examining what the exceptions are turned out to be to lead to

1:42:46.080 --> 1:42:50.640
 little kinds of insight about the nature of fundamental interactions, especially the properties

1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:54.480
 of neutrinos and the weak interaction. It's a long story, but it's a very...

1:42:55.360 --> 1:42:59.360
 So you just define the C and the P, the conjugation, the charge conjugation.

1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:02.240
 Now that I've done that, I want to shove them off.

1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:10.560
 Because it's easier to talk about T, which is time reversal symmetry. We have very good reasons to

1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:19.760
 think CPT is an accurate symmetry of nature. It's on the same level as relativity and quantum

1:43:19.760 --> 1:43:27.440
 mechanics, basically. So that better be true. So it's symmetric when you do conjugation parity

1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:34.000
 in time. And time and space reversal. If you do all three, then you get the same physical

1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:42.080
 consequences. But that means that CP is equivalent to T. But what's observed in the world is that

1:43:42.080 --> 1:43:51.440
 T is not quite an accurate symmetry of nature, either. So most phenomena at the fundamental

1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:57.120
 level, so interactions among elementary particles and the basic gravitational interaction,

1:43:57.120 --> 1:44:09.920
 if you ran them backwards in time, you'd get the same laws. So this time, we don't talk about

1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:17.520
 a mirror, but we talk about a movie. If you take a movie and then run it backwards,

1:44:18.640 --> 1:44:23.280
 that's the time reversal. It's good to think about a mirror in time.

1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:30.720
 Yes, like a mirror in time. If you run the movie backwards, it would look very strange if you

1:44:30.720 --> 1:44:37.840
 were looking at complicated objects and a Charlie Chaplin movie or whatever. It would look very

1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:44.720
 strange if you ran it backwards in time. But at the level of basic interactions, if you were able

1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:51.120
 to look at the atoms and the quarks involved, they would obey the same laws to a very good

1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:55.840
 approximation, but not exactly. So not exactly. That means you could tell.

1:44:55.840 --> 1:45:03.040
 You could tell, but you'd have to do very, very subtle experiments with that high energy

1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:10.160
 accelerators to take a movie that looked different when you ran it backwards. This was a discovery

1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:21.280
 by two great physicists named Jim Cronin and Val Fitch in the mid 1960s. Previous to that,

1:45:21.280 --> 1:45:26.240
 over all the centuries of development of physics with all its precise laws, they did seem to have

1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:33.360
 this gratuitous property that they looked the same if you run the equations backwards. It's

1:45:33.360 --> 1:45:39.280
 kind of an embarrassing property, actually, because life isn't like that. So empirical

1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:44.160
 reality does not have this imagery in any obvious way. And yet the laws did.

1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:48.640
 It's almost like the laws of physics are missing something fundamental about life

1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:53.760
 if it holds that property, right? Well, that's the embarrassing nature of it.

1:45:53.760 --> 1:46:03.200
 Yeah, it's embarrassing. Well, people worked hard at what this was a problem that's thought to

1:46:03.200 --> 1:46:09.760
 belong to the foundations of statistical mechanics or the foundations of thermodynamics

1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:19.920
 to understand how behavior, which is grossly not symmetric with respect to reversing the

1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:26.320
 direction of time in large objects, how that can emerge from equations which are symmetric

1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:31.920
 with respect to changing the direction of time to a very good approximation. And that's still

1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:38.240
 an interesting endeavor that's interesting. And actually, it's an exciting frontier of physics

1:46:38.240 --> 1:46:42.560
 now to sort of explore the boundary between when that's true and when it's not true, when you get

1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:48.720
 to smaller objects and exceptions like time crystals. I definitely have to ask you about

1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:55.520
 time crystals in a second here. So the CP problem and T, so there's lost all of these.

1:46:55.520 --> 1:46:58.880
 We're in danger of infinite regress, but we'll have to convert soon.

1:46:58.880 --> 1:47:03.280
 No, it can't possibly be turtles all the way down. We're going to get to the bottom turtle.

1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:15.200
 Okay. So it got to be a really puzzling thing why the laws should have this very odd property

1:47:15.200 --> 1:47:22.000
 that we don't need. And in fact, it's kind of an embarrassment in addressing empirical reality.

1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:28.880
 But it seemed to be almost, it seemed to be exactly true for a long time. And then almost true.

1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:35.840
 And in way almost true is even is more disturbing than exactly true because

1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:40.400
 exactly true. It could have been just a fundamental feature of the world. And at some

1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:45.920
 level, you just have to take it as it is. And if it's a beautiful, easily articulatable

1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:52.160
 regularity, you could say that, okay, that's fine as a fundamental law of nature. But to say that

1:47:52.160 --> 1:47:59.360
 is approximately true, but not exactly. That's not weird. That's weird. So, and then, so there was

1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:09.360
 great progress in the late part of the 20th century in getting to an understanding of

1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:16.720
 fundamental interactions in general, that shed light on this issue. It turns out that the

1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:25.680
 basic principles of relativity and quantum mechanics plus the kind of high degree of

1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:31.200
 symmetry that we found, the so called gauge symmetry that characterizes the fundamental

1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:36.160
 interactions. When you put all that together, it's a very, very constraining framework.

1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:45.280
 And it has some indirect consequences because the possible interactions are so constrained.

1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:54.240
 And one of the indirect consequences is that the possibilities for violating the symmetry

1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:59.040
 between forwards and backwards in time are very limited. They're basically only two.

1:48:59.040 --> 1:49:06.720
 Okay. And one of them occurs and leads to a very rich theory that explains the Cronin fish

1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:11.600
 experiment. And a lot of things that have been done subsequently has been used to make all kinds

1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:20.560
 of successful predictions. So, that's turned out to be a very rich interaction. It's esoteric,

1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:24.720
 and the effects are only show up at accelerators and are small and so on. But they might have

1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:30.000
 been very important in the early universe and lead to them be connected to the asymmetry between

1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:37.840
 matter and antimatter in the present universe. But that's another digression. The point is that

1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:44.960
 that was fine. That was a triumph to say that there was one possible kind of interaction that

1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:53.280
 would violate time reversal symmetry. And sure enough, there it is. But the other kind doesn't

1:49:53.280 --> 1:50:01.280
 occur. So, we still got a problem. Why doesn't it occur? So, we're close to really finally

1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:08.240
 understanding this profound gratuitous feature of the world that is almost but not quite symmetric

1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:16.800
 under reversing the direction of time, but not quite there. And to get to understand that last bit

1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:26.240
 is a challenging frontier of physics today. And we have a promising proposal for how it works,

1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:36.080
 which is a kind of theory of evolution. So, there's this possible interaction, which we call a

1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:42.880
 coupling, and there's a numerical quantity that tells us how strong that is. And traditionally

1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:51.840
 in physics, we think of these kinds of numerical quantities as constants of nature that you just

1:50:51.840 --> 1:50:59.520
 have to put them in from experiment. They have a certain value and that's it. And who am I to

1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:13.840
 question? They seem to be just constants. But in this case, it's been fruitful to think and work

1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:30.160
 out a theory where that strength of interaction is actually not a constant. It's a field or the

1:51:30.160 --> 1:51:35.040
 fundamental ingredients of modern physics. There's an electron field, there's a photon field,

1:51:35.040 --> 1:51:40.080
 which is also called the electromagnetic field. And so, all of these particles are manifestations

1:51:40.080 --> 1:51:47.520
 of different fields. And there could be a field, something that depends on space and time,

1:51:47.520 --> 1:51:57.440
 so a dynamical entity instead of just a constant here. And if you do things in a nice way,

1:51:57.440 --> 1:52:03.920
 that's very symmetric, very much suggested aesthetically by the theory, but the theory

1:52:03.920 --> 1:52:15.120
 we do have, then you find that you get a field which as it evolves from the early universe

1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:29.040
 settles down to a value that's just right to make the laws very nearly exact,

1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:33.440
 invariant or symmetric with respect to reversal of time.

1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:36.480
 It might appear as a constant, but it's actually a field that evolved over time.

1:52:36.480 --> 1:52:43.840
 It evolved over time. But when you examine this proposal in detail, you find that it hasn't quite

1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:53.760
 settled down to exactly zero. The field is still moving around a little bit. And because the motion

1:52:53.760 --> 1:53:00.960
 is so, the motion is so difficult. The material is so rigid. And this

1:53:00.960 --> 1:53:06.000
 mistero, the field that fills all space is so rigid. Even small amounts of motion can involve

1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:17.040
 lots of energy. And that energy takes the form of particles, fields that are in motion are always

1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:23.920
 associated with particles. And those are the axions. And if you calculate how much energy is in these

1:53:23.920 --> 1:53:31.200
 residual oscillations, this axion gas that fills all the universe, if this fundamental theory

1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:39.200
 is correct, you get just the right amount to make the dark matter that astronomers want.

1:53:39.200 --> 1:53:44.080
 And it has just the right properties. So I'd love to believe that.

1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:50.000
 So that might be a thing that unlocks might be the key to understanding dark matter.

1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:53.840
 Yeah, I'd like to think so. And many, many physicists are coming around to this point of

1:53:53.840 --> 1:54:00.640
 view, which I've been a voice in the wilderness. I was a voice in the wilderness so long time.

1:54:00.640 --> 1:54:03.920
 But now, now it's become very popular, maybe even dominant.

1:54:04.480 --> 1:54:13.840
 So almost like, so this axion particle slash field would be the thing that explains dark matter.

1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:21.600
 It would solve this fundamental question of finally of why the laws are almost but not

1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:30.240
 quite exactly the same if you run them backwards in time. And then seemingly in a totally different

1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:37.840
 conceptual universe, it would also provide, give us an understanding of the dark matter.

1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:44.240
 That's not what it was designed for. And the theory wasn't, wasn't proposed with that in mind.

1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:47.760
 But when you work out the equations, that's what you get.

1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:49.200
 That's always a good sign. Yes.

1:54:50.880 --> 1:54:59.520
 I think I vaguely read somewhere that there may be early experimental validation of axion.

1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:02.000
 Is that am I, am I reading the wrong?

1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:07.120
 Well, there have been quite a few false alarms and I think there are some of them still,

1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:14.400
 people desperately want to find this thing. But I don't think, I don't think any of them

1:55:14.400 --> 1:55:22.880
 are convincing at this point, but there are very ambitious experiments and kind of new,

1:55:22.880 --> 1:55:28.160
 you have to design new kinds of antennas that are capable of detecting these predicted particles.

1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:32.800
 And it's very difficult. They interact very, very weakly. If it were easy, it would have been

1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:40.880
 done already. But I think there's good hope that we can get down to the required sensitivity

1:55:40.880 --> 1:55:46.720
 and actually test whether these ideas are right in coming years or maybe decades.

1:55:47.840 --> 1:55:51.920
 And then understand one of the big mysteries, like literally big in terms of

1:55:52.800 --> 1:55:55.600
 its fraction of the universe is dark matter. Yes.

1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:59.680
 Yes. Let me ask you about, you mentioned a few times, time crystals.

1:56:01.840 --> 1:56:08.160
 What are they? These things are, it's a very beautiful idea when we started to treat space and

1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:16.560
 time as similar frameworks, physical phenomena. Right. That's what motivated it.

1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:20.400
 First of all, what are crystals and what are time crystals?

1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:32.080
 Okay. So crystals are orderly arrangements of atoms in space. And many materials, if you cool them

1:56:32.080 --> 1:56:45.200
 down gently, will form crystals. And so we say that that's a state of matter that forms spontaneously.

1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:53.440
 And an important feature of that state of matter is that the end result, the crystal,

1:56:56.880 --> 1:57:04.480
 has less symmetry than the equations that give rise to the crystal. So the equations,

1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:13.520
 the basic equations of physics, are the same if you move a little bit. So you can move,

1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:19.200
 they're homogeneous, but crystals aren't. The atoms are in particular places that they have

1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:28.080
 less symmetry. And time crystals are the same thing in time. But of course, it's not, so it's

1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:38.240
 not positions of atoms, but it's ordering orderly behavior that certain states of matter will

1:57:38.240 --> 1:57:46.640
 arrange themselves into spontaneously if you treat them gently and let them do what they want to do.

1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:49.920
 But repeat in that same way indefinitely.

1:57:49.920 --> 1:57:56.640
 That's the crystal inform. You can also have time liquids or you can have all kinds of other

1:57:56.640 --> 1:58:01.280
 states of matter. You don't have space time crystals where the pattern only repeats if,

1:58:02.400 --> 1:58:06.560
 with each step of time, you also move at a certain direction in space.

1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:19.120
 So basically, it's states of matter that display structure in time spontaneously.

1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:27.600
 So here's the difference. When it happens in time, it sure looks a lot like it's motion.

1:58:27.600 --> 1:58:31.600
 And if it repeats indefinitely, it sure looks a lot like perpetual motion.

1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:38.800
 Yeah. It looks like free lunch. I was told that there's no such thing as free lunch.

1:58:38.800 --> 1:58:41.440
 Does this violate laws of thermodynamics?

1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:49.200
 No, but it requires a critical examination of the laws of thermodynamics. Let me say on

1:58:49.200 --> 1:58:56.000
 background that the laws of thermodynamics are not fundamental laws of physics. There are things we

1:58:56.000 --> 1:59:05.280
 prove under certain circumstances emerge from the fundamental laws of physics. We don't

1:59:05.280 --> 1:59:09.680
 posit them separately. They're meant to be deduced. And they can be deduced under limited

1:59:09.680 --> 1:59:15.600
 circumstances but not necessarily universally. And we found finding some of the subtleties and

1:59:15.600 --> 1:59:23.200
 sort of edge cases where they don't apply in a straightforward way. And this is one.

1:59:23.200 --> 1:59:33.120
 So time crystals do obey, do have this structure in time, but it's not a free lunch because although,

1:59:33.120 --> 1:59:38.640
 in a sense, things are moving, they're already doing what they want to do.

1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:46.640
 So if you want to extract energy from it, you're going to be foiled because there's no spare energy

1:59:46.640 --> 1:59:56.800
 there. So you can add energy to it and kind of disturb it, but you can't extract energy

1:59:56.800 --> 2:00:03.200
 from this motion because it wants to do, that's the lowest energy configuration that there is,

2:00:03.200 --> 2:00:08.160
 so you can't get further energy out of it. So in theory, I guess perpetual motion,

2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:14.880
 you would be able to extract energy from it. If such a thing was to be created,

2:00:14.880 --> 2:00:16.960
 you can then milk it for energy.

2:00:16.960 --> 2:00:23.280
 Well, what's usually meant in the literature of perpetual motion is

2:00:25.600 --> 2:00:32.160
 a kind of macroscopic motion that you could extract energy from and somehow it would crank

2:00:32.160 --> 2:00:40.640
 back up. That's not the case here. If you want to extract energy, this motion is not something

2:00:40.640 --> 2:00:47.040
 you're going to extract energy from. If you intervene in the behavior, you can change it,

2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:50.240
 but only by injecting energy, not by taking away energy.

2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:57.360
 You mentioned that a theory of everything may be quite difficult to come by. A theory of everything

2:00:57.360 --> 2:01:02.000
 broadly defined meaning truly a theory of everything. But let's look at a more narrow

2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:10.320
 theory of everything, which is that the way it's used often in physics is a theory that unifies

2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:21.360
 our current laws of physics, general relativity, quantum field theory. Do you have thoughts on

2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:27.920
 this dream of a theory of everything in physics? How close are we? Is there any promising ideas

2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:33.760
 out there in your view? Well, it would be nice to have. It would be aesthetically pleasing.

2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:43.120
 Will it be useful? No, probably not. Well, I shouldn't. It's dangerous to say that,

2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:50.960
 but probably not. I think we're certainly not in the foreseeable future.

2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:57.760
 Maybe to understand black holes. Yes, maybe to understand black holes, but

2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:11.840
 that's not useful. It's not useful in the sense that we're not going to be basing any technology

2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:16.800
 anytime soon on black holes, but it's more severe than that, I would say. It's that

2:02:16.800 --> 2:02:24.560
 that the kinds of questions about black holes that we can't answer within the framework of

2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:34.800
 existing theory are ones that are not going to be susceptible to astronomical observation

2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:42.800
 in the foreseeable future. There are questions about very, very small black holes when quantum

2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:54.160
 effects come into play or so that black holes are not black holes. They're emitting this

2:02:54.160 --> 2:03:00.080
 discovery of Hawking called Hawking radiation, which for astronomical black holes is a tiny,

2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:04.240
 tiny effect that no one has ever observed. It's a prediction that's never been checked.

2:03:04.240 --> 2:03:06.560
 I feel like supermassive black holes that doesn't apply.

2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:14.560
 No, no. The predicted rate of radiation from those black holes is so tiny that it's absolutely

2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:23.440
 unobservable and is overwhelmed by all kinds of other effects. It's not practical in the sense

2:03:23.440 --> 2:03:32.320
 of technology. It's not even practical in the sense of application to astronomy. We are existing

2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:40.960
 theory of general relativity and quantum theory and our theory of the different fundamental

2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:57.920
 forces is perfectly adequate to all problems of technology, for sure, and almost all problems

2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:07.760
 of astrophysics and cosmology that appear except with the notable exception of the extremely

2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:12.000
 early universe, if you want to ask what happened before the Big Bang or what happened right at the

2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:18.000
 Big Bang, which would be a great thing to understand, of course. We don't.

2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:26.240
 But what about the engineering question? So if we look at space travel, I think you've spoken

2:04:26.240 --> 2:04:36.880
 with him, Eric Weinstein, really he says things like we want to get off this planet. His intuition

2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:43.840
 is almost a motivator for the engineering project of space exploration. In order for us to crack

2:04:43.840 --> 2:04:49.920
 this problem of becoming a multiplanetary species, we have to solve the physics problem. His intuition

2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:59.200
 is like if we figure out what he calls the source code, which is like a theory of everything might

2:04:59.200 --> 2:05:06.320
 give us clues on how to start hacking the fabric of reality, like getting shortcuts, right?

2:05:06.320 --> 2:05:15.520
 It might. I can't say that it won't, but I can say that in the 1970s and early 1980s,

2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:26.880
 we achieved huge steps in understanding matter. QCD, much better understanding of the weak

2:05:26.880 --> 2:05:36.080
 interaction, much better understanding of quantum mechanics in general, and it's had minimal impact

2:05:36.080 --> 2:05:40.560
 on technology. On rocket design, on propulsion. Certainly on rocket design, on anything, any

2:05:40.560 --> 2:05:48.000
 technology whatsoever. Now we're talking about much more esoteric things. Since I don't know

2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:52.480
 what they are, I can't say for sure that they won't affect technology, but I'm very, very skeptical

2:05:52.480 --> 2:06:02.320
 that they would affect technology. Because to access them, you need very exotic circumstances

2:06:02.320 --> 2:06:07.680
 to make new kinds of particles with high energy. You need accelerators that are very expensive

2:06:07.680 --> 2:06:14.320
 and you don't produce many of them and so forth. It's a pipe dream, I think, about space exploration.

2:06:15.200 --> 2:06:27.680
 I'm not sure exactly what he has in mind, but to me, it's more a problem of something between

2:06:27.680 --> 2:06:41.040
 biology and information processing. What you mean, I think human bodies are not well adapted

2:06:41.040 --> 2:06:49.360
 to space. Even Mars, which is the closest thing to a kind of human environment that we're going

2:06:49.360 --> 2:06:59.840
 to find anywhere close by, very, very difficult to maintain humans on Mars and very expensive

2:06:59.840 --> 2:07:14.560
 and very unstable. However, if we take a broader view of what it means to bring human civilization

2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:23.440
 outside of the Earth, if we're satisfied with sending minds out there that we can

2:07:24.240 --> 2:07:33.680
 converse with and actuators that we can manipulate and sensors that we can get feedback from,

2:07:33.680 --> 2:07:44.240
 I think that's where it's at. I think that's so much more realistic. I think that's

2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:50.480
 the long term future of space exploration. It's not hauling human bodies all over the place and

2:07:50.480 --> 2:07:58.400
 that's just silly. It's possible that human bodies, like you said, it's a biology problem.

2:07:58.960 --> 2:08:07.360
 What's possible is that we extend human lab span in some way. We have to look at a bigger picture.

2:08:07.360 --> 2:08:16.160
 It could be just like you're saying by sending robots with actuators and extending our limbs,

2:08:16.160 --> 2:08:19.680
 but it could also be extending some aspect of our minds and information.

2:08:19.680 --> 2:08:35.120
 It could be cyborgs. It could be human brains or cells that realize something like human brain

2:08:35.120 --> 2:08:46.000
 architecture within artificial environments, shells, if you like, that are more adapted

2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:58.800
 to the conditions of space. Man machine hybrids as well as remote outposts that we can communicate

2:08:58.800 --> 2:09:06.160
 with. I think those will happen. To me, there's some sense in which, as opposed to understanding

2:09:06.160 --> 2:09:16.800
 the physics of the fundamental fabric of the universe, I think getting to the physics of

2:09:16.800 --> 2:09:22.160
 life, the physics of intelligence, the physics of consciousness, the physics of information

2:09:22.160 --> 2:09:31.600
 that brings from which life emerges, that will allow us to do space exploration.

2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:35.920
 Well, I think physics in the larger sense has a lot to contribute here,

2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:44.560
 not the physics of finding fundamental new laws in the sense of another quark or axions even.

2:09:44.560 --> 2:09:57.600
 Physics has a lot of experience in analyzing complex situations and analyzing new states

2:09:57.600 --> 2:10:04.880
 of matter and devising new kinds of instruments that do clever things. Physics in that sense

2:10:04.880 --> 2:10:13.840
 has enormous amounts to contribute to this kind of endeavor, but I don't think that looking for a

2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:18.880
 so called theory of everything has much to do with it at all.

2:10:18.880 --> 2:10:26.240
 What advice would you give to a young person today with a bit of fire in their eyes,

2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:30.240
 high school student, college student thinking about what to do with their life,

2:10:30.240 --> 2:10:35.920
 maybe advice about career or bigger advice about life in general?

2:10:37.280 --> 2:10:43.680
 Well, first read fundamentals because there I've tried to give some coherent,

2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:50.000
 deep advice. That's fundamentals, 10 keys to reality by Frank Ulczak.

2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:50.880
 So that's a good place to start.

2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:52.160
 Available everywhere.

2:10:52.160 --> 2:10:54.800
 If you want to learn what I can tell you.

2:10:54.800 --> 2:11:00.480
 Is there an audiobook? Yes, there is an audiobook, that's awesome.

2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:07.200
 Yeah, I think I can give three pieces of wise advice that I think are generally applicable.

2:11:08.400 --> 2:11:19.280
 One is to cast a wide net, to really look around and see what looks promising,

2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:28.160
 what catches your imagination. You have to balance those two things.

2:11:28.160 --> 2:11:32.480
 You can have things that catch your imagination, but don't look promising in the sense that

2:11:32.480 --> 2:11:39.200
 the questions aren't ripe. And things that you, in part of what makes things

2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:45.280
 attractive is that, whether you thought you liked them or not, if you can see that there's

2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:51.440
 ferment and new ideas coming up, that's attractive in itself. So when I started out,

2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:56.000
 I thought I was, and when I was an undergraduate, I intended to study philosophy or questions of

2:11:56.000 --> 2:12:00.080
 how mind emerges from matter, but I thought that that wasn't really ripe.

2:12:00.080 --> 2:12:01.040
 The timing isn't right yet.

2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:05.200
 The timing wasn't right for the kind of mathematical thinking and

2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:09.920
 conceptualization that I really enjoy and am good at.

2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:19.920
 But so that's one thing, cast a wide net, look around. And that's

2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:29.200
 a pretty easy thing to do today because of the internet. You can look at all kinds of things.

2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:36.000
 You have to be careful, though, because there's a lot of crap also. But you can sort of tell the

2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:46.160
 difference if you do a little digging. So don't settle on just what your thesis advisor tells

2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:53.520
 you to do or what your teacher tells you to do. Look for yourself and get a sense of what seems

2:12:53.520 --> 2:13:08.240
 promising, not what seemed promising 10 years ago. So that's one. Another thing is kind of

2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:14.720
 complimentary to that. Well, they're all complimentary. Complimentary to that is to

2:13:16.160 --> 2:13:22.160
 read history and read the masters of the history of ideas and masters of ideas.

2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:34.320
 I benefited enormously as early in my career from reading in physics, Einstein in the original,

2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:43.360
 and Feynman's lectures as they were coming out, and Darwin. You can learn what it is in Galileo.

2:13:43.360 --> 2:13:48.000
 You can learn what it is to wrestle with difficult ideas and how great minds did that.

2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:57.520
 You can learn a lot about style, how to write your ideas up and express them in clear ways.

2:13:57.520 --> 2:14:02.080
 And also just a couple of that with, I also enjoy reading biographies.

2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:08.480
 And biographies, yes, similarly. So it gives you the context of the human being that created

2:14:08.480 --> 2:14:13.440
 those ideas. Right. And brings it down to earth in the sense that it was really human beings who

2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:23.200
 did this, and they made mistakes. And I also got inspiration from Bertrand Russell, who was a big

2:14:23.200 --> 2:14:32.320
 hero, and H.G. Wells. So read the masters, make contact with great minds. And when you are sort

2:14:32.320 --> 2:14:37.360
 of narrowing down on a subject, learn about the history of the subject, because that really puts

2:14:37.360 --> 2:14:45.040
 in context what you're trying to do, and also gives a sense of community and grandeur to the whole

2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:53.280
 enterprise. And then the third piece of advice is complementary to both those, which is sort of to

2:14:54.720 --> 2:15:03.440
 get the basics under control as soon as possible. So if you want to do theoretical work in science,

2:15:03.440 --> 2:15:10.800
 you know, you have to learn calculus, multivariable calculus, complex variables, group theory.

2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:16.800
 Nowadays, you have to be highly computer literate. If you want to do experimental work, you also have

2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:21.440
 to be computer literate, then you have to learn about electronics and optics and instruments.

2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:28.240
 And so get that under control as soon as possible, because it's like learning a language

2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:35.200
 to produce great works and express yourself fluently and with confidence.

2:15:37.840 --> 2:15:41.200
 It should be your native language. These things should be like your native language,

2:15:41.200 --> 2:15:49.760
 so you're not wondering what is a derivative. This is just part of your, you know, it's in your

2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:56.000
 bones, so to speak. And the sooner that you can do that, the better. So all those things

2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:03.760
 can be done in parallel and should be. You've accomplished some incredible things in your life,

2:16:04.480 --> 2:16:14.400
 but the sad thing about this thing we have is it ends. Do you think about your mortality?

2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:20.560
 Are you afraid of death? Well, afraid is the wrong word. I mean,

2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:27.600
 I wish it weren't going to happen, and I'd like to. But do you think about it?

2:16:28.720 --> 2:16:33.120
 Occasionally, I think about, well, I think about it very operationally in the sense that

2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:41.600
 there's always a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. This is a classic subject in

2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:48.240
 computer science, actually, in machine learning, that when you're in an unusual circumstance,

2:16:48.240 --> 2:16:55.680
 so you want to explore to see what the landscape is and gather data. But then at some point,

2:16:55.680 --> 2:17:01.520
 you want to use that, make choices and say, this is what I'm going to do and exploit the

2:17:01.520 --> 2:17:10.320
 knowledge you've accumulated. And the longer the period of exploitation you anticipate,

2:17:10.320 --> 2:17:17.360
 the more exploration you should do in new directions. And so for me, I've had to sort of

2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:28.080
 adjust the balance of exploration and exploitation. And that said, you've explored quite a lot.

2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:34.720
 Yeah. Well, I haven't shut off the exploitation at all. I'm still hoping for the exploration.

2:17:34.720 --> 2:17:39.600
 Right. I'm still hoping for 10 or 15 years of top flight performance. But

2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:49.600
 the several years ago now, when I was 50 years old, I was at the Institute for Advanced Study and

2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:54.080
 my office was right under Freeman Dyson's office and we were kind of friendly. And

2:17:56.320 --> 2:18:02.880
 he found out it was my 50th birthday and said, congratulations. And you should feel liberated

2:18:02.880 --> 2:18:09.360
 because no one expects much of a 50 year old theoretical physicist. And he obviously had felt

2:18:09.360 --> 2:18:18.640
 liberated by reaching a certain age. And yeah, there is something to that. I feel I don't have

2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:25.520
 to catch, I don't have to keep in touch with the latest hyper technical developments in particle

2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:34.960
 physics or string theory. Because I'm really not going to be exploiting that. But where I am

2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:41.600
 exploring in these directions of machine learning and things like that. But I'm also

2:18:41.600 --> 2:18:48.080
 concentrating within physics on exploiting directions that I've already established and the

2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:58.160
 laws that we already have. And doing things like I'm very actively involved in trying to design,

2:18:58.160 --> 2:19:05.280
 helping people, experimentalists and engineers even to design antennas that are capable of

2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:13.360
 detecting axions. So there, and that's there, we're deep in the exploitation stage. It's not a

2:19:13.360 --> 2:19:19.600
 matter of finding the new laws, but of really using the laws we have to kind of finish the

2:19:19.600 --> 2:19:29.920
 story off. So it's complicated. But I'm very happy with my life right now and I'm enjoying it. And

2:19:29.920 --> 2:19:36.800
 I don't want to cloud that by thinking too much that it's going to come to an end.

2:19:36.800 --> 2:19:49.040
 And you know, it's a gift I didn't earn. Is there a good thing to say about why this gift

2:19:49.040 --> 2:19:54.400
 that you've gotten and didn't deserve is so damn enjoyable? So like, what's the meaning of this

2:19:54.400 --> 2:20:03.840
 thing of life? To me, interacting with people I love, my family, and I have a very wide circle

2:20:03.840 --> 2:20:10.560
 of friends now. And I'm trying to produce some institutions that will survive me as well as

2:20:11.280 --> 2:20:23.920
 work. And it's just, it's, how should I say, it's a positive feedback work loop when you do

2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:29.440
 something and your people appreciate it. And then you want to do more and they get rewarded.

2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:34.320
 And it's just, how should I say, this is another gift that I didn't earn and don't

2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:41.440
 understand, but I have a dopamine system. And yeah, I'm happy to use it.

2:20:42.080 --> 2:20:48.800
 It seems to get energized by the creative process, by the process of exploration.

2:20:48.800 --> 2:20:49.520
 Very much so.

2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:57.680
 And all of that started from the little fluctuations shortly after the Big Bang.

2:20:57.680 --> 2:21:03.440
 Frank, well, whatever the, those initial conditions and fluctuation did that created you,

2:21:03.440 --> 2:21:08.480
 I'm glad they did. This was, thank you for all the work you've done for the many people you've

2:21:08.480 --> 2:21:14.080
 inspired, for the many of the billion, most of your ideas were pretty useless of the

2:21:14.080 --> 2:21:21.120
 several billions, but as it is for all humans, but you had quite a few truly special ideas.

2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:25.520
 And thank you for bringing those to the world. And thank you for wasting your valuable time

2:21:25.520 --> 2:21:27.760
 with me today. It's truly not.

2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:35.600
 It's been a joy. And I hope people enjoy it. And I think, you know, the kind of mind expansion

2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:42.080
 that I've enjoyed by interacting with physical reality at this deep level, I think can be

2:21:42.080 --> 2:21:47.440
 conveyed to and enjoyed by many, many people. And that's, that's one of my missions in life.

2:21:47.440 --> 2:21:48.080
 It's beautiful.

2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:52.640
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Frank Wilczak. And thank you to

2:21:52.640 --> 2:21:59.680

2:21:59.680 --> 2:22:04.320
 to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.

2:22:04.320 --> 2:22:22.400
 Nothing happens until something moves. Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
