00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
 The following is a conversation with Neil Ferguson,

00:02.640 --> 00:04.960
 one of the great historians of our time,

00:04.960 --> 00:07.660
 at times controversial and always brilliant,

00:07.660 --> 00:09.760
 whether you agree with him or not.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.840
 He's an author of 16 books on topics covering

00:13.840 --> 00:18.440
 the history of money, power, war, pandemics, and empire.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.360
 Previously at Harvard, currently at Stanford,

00:21.360 --> 00:25.920
 and today launching a new university here in Austin, Texas

00:25.920 --> 00:28.720
 called the University of Austin,

00:28.720 --> 00:31.840
 a new institution built from the ground up

00:31.840 --> 00:34.520
 to encourage open inquiry and discourse

00:34.520 --> 00:36.240
 by both thinkers and doers,

00:36.240 --> 00:38.120
 from philosophers and historians,

00:38.120 --> 00:40.200
 to scientists and engineers,

00:40.200 --> 00:43.920
 embracing debate, dissent, and self examination,

00:43.920 --> 00:46.880
 free to speak, to disagree, to think,

00:46.880 --> 00:49.740
 to explore truly novel ideas.

00:49.740 --> 00:52.100
 The advisory board includes Stephen Pinker,

00:52.100 --> 00:55.200
 Jonathan Haidt, and many other amazing people

00:55.200 --> 00:58.560
 with one exception, me.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.240
 I was graciously invited to be on the advisory board,

01:01.240 --> 01:04.320
 which I accepted in the hope of doing my small part

01:04.320 --> 01:08.040
 in helping build the future of education and open discourse,

01:08.040 --> 01:10.480
 especially in the fields of artificial intelligence,

01:10.480 --> 01:12.200
 robotics, and computing.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.460
 We spend the first hour of this conversation

01:14.460 --> 01:16.560
 talking about this new university

01:16.560 --> 01:18.880
 before switching to talking about

01:18.880 --> 01:21.120
 some of the darkest moments in human history

01:21.120 --> 01:23.640
 and what they reveal about human nature.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.520
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.680
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:28.680 --> 01:29.920
 in the description.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.860
 And now, here's my conversation with Neil Ferguson.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.280
 You are one of the great historians of our time,

01:37.280 --> 01:40.120
 respected, sometimes controversial.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.160
 You have flourished in some of the best universities

01:42.160 --> 01:45.160
 in the world, from NYU to London School of Economics,

01:45.160 --> 01:49.480
 to Harvard, and now to Hoover Institution at Stanford.

01:49.480 --> 01:53.200
 Before we talk about the history of money, war, and power,

01:53.200 --> 01:55.720
 let us talk about a new university.

01:55.720 --> 01:59.720
 You're a part of launching here in Austin, Texas.

01:59.720 --> 02:04.720
 It is called University of Austin, UATX.

02:04.880 --> 02:08.100
 What is its mission, its goals, its plan?

02:09.320 --> 02:13.960
 I think it's pretty obvious to a lot of people

02:13.960 --> 02:17.600
 in higher education that there's a problem.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.480
 And that problem manifests itself

02:19.480 --> 02:22.060
 in a great many different ways.

02:22.060 --> 02:25.760
 But I would sum up the problem as being

02:25.760 --> 02:30.600
 a drastic chilling of the atmosphere

02:30.600 --> 02:34.480
 that constrains free speech, free exchange,

02:34.480 --> 02:35.700
 even free thought.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.600
 And I had never anticipated that this would happen

02:39.600 --> 02:40.440
 in my lifetime.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.120
 My academic career began in Oxford in the 1980s

02:43.120 --> 02:45.560
 when anything went.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.040
 One sensed that a university was a place

02:48.040 --> 02:51.280
 where one could risk saying the unsayable.

02:51.280 --> 02:54.340
 And debate the undebatable.

02:54.340 --> 02:58.640
 So the fact that in a relatively short space of time,

02:58.640 --> 03:02.160
 a variety of ideas, critical race theory or wokeism,

03:02.160 --> 03:03.000
 whatever you want to call it,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.560
 a variety of ideas have come along that seek to limit

03:06.560 --> 03:10.040
 and quite drastically limit what we can talk about,

03:10.040 --> 03:12.600
 strikes me as deeply unhealthy.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.060
 And I'm not sure, and I've thought about this for a long time,

03:15.060 --> 03:17.700
 you can fix it with the existing institutions.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.040
 I think you need to create a new one.

03:20.040 --> 03:24.000
 And so after much deliberation, we decided to do it.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
 And I think it's a hugely timely opportunity

03:29.960 --> 03:33.080
 to do what people used to do in this country,

03:33.080 --> 03:34.620
 which was to create new institutions.

03:34.620 --> 03:37.520
 I mean, that used to be the default setting of America.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.580
 We sort of stopped doing that.

03:38.580 --> 03:39.600
 I mean, I look back and I'm like,

03:39.600 --> 03:41.840
 why are there no new universities?

03:41.840 --> 03:45.080
 Or at least if there are, why do they have sort of impact?

03:45.080 --> 03:48.000
 It seems like we have the billionaires,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.600
 we have the need.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.440
 Let's do it.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.040
 So you still believe in institutions,

03:53.040 --> 03:56.000
 in the university, in the ideal of the university?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.160
 I believe passionately in that ideal,

03:59.160 --> 04:02.720
 there's a reason they've been around for nearly a millennium.

04:02.720 --> 04:07.720
 There is a unique thing that happens

04:08.360 --> 04:11.940
 on a university campus when it's done right.

04:11.940 --> 04:16.540
 And that is the transfer of knowledge between generations.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.280
 That is a very sacred activity.

04:18.280 --> 04:22.800
 And it seems to withstand major changes in technology.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.160
 So this form that we call the university

04:25.160 --> 04:27.240
 predates the printing press,

04:27.240 --> 04:29.600
 survive the printing press,

04:29.600 --> 04:32.040
 continue to function through the scientific revolution,

04:32.040 --> 04:37.040
 the enlightenment, the industrial revolution to this day.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.280
 And I think it's because,

04:39.280 --> 04:41.520
 maybe because of evolutionary psychology,

04:41.520 --> 04:48.520
 we need to be together in one relatively confined space,

04:48.640 --> 04:51.840
 when we're in our late teens and early twenties,

04:51.840 --> 04:56.320
 for the knowledge transfer between the generations to happen.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.200
 That's my feeling about this.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.720
 But in order for it to work well,

05:00.720 --> 05:03.680
 there needs to be very few constraints.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.720
 There needs to be a sense

05:05.720 --> 05:07.880
 that one can take intellectual risk.

05:07.880 --> 05:12.000
 Remember, people in their late teens and early twenties are adults,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.240
 but they're inexperienced adults.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.720
 And if I look back on my own time as an undergraduate,

05:17.720 --> 05:21.720
 saying stupid things was my MO,

05:21.720 --> 05:28.720
 my way to finding good ideas was through a minefield of bad ideas.

05:28.760 --> 05:33.280
 I feel so sorry for people like me today.

05:33.280 --> 05:40.280
 People age 18, 19, 20 today, who are intellectually very curious,

05:40.280 --> 05:42.960
 ambitious, but inexperienced,

05:42.960 --> 05:47.880
 because the minefields today are absolutely lethal.

05:47.880 --> 05:52.040
 And one wrong food and it's cancellation.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.360
 I said this to Peter Thiel the other day.

05:54.360 --> 05:57.000
 Imagine being us now.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.200
 I mean, we were obnoxious undergraduates.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.480
 There's nothing that Peter did at Stanford

06:03.480 --> 06:06.400
 that Andrew Sullivan and I were not doing at Oxford.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.080
 And perhaps we were even worse.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.680
 But it was so not career ending

06:11.680 --> 06:21.040
 to be an absolutely insufferable, obnoxious undergraduate then.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.520
 Today, if people like us exist today,

06:24.520 --> 06:28.240
 they must live in a state of constant anxiety

06:28.240 --> 06:32.840
 that they're going to be outed for some heretical statement

06:32.840 --> 06:35.240
 that they made five years ago on social media.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.520
 So part of what motivates me is that it's the desire

06:38.520 --> 06:44.480
 to give the mise of today a shot at free thinking

06:44.480 --> 06:51.760
 and really, I'd call it, aggressive learning.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.240
 Learning where you're really pushed.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.320
 And I just think that stopped happening

06:56.320 --> 06:58.160
 on the major campuses.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.240
 Because whether at Harvard, where I used to teach,

07:00.240 --> 07:01.680
 or at Stanford, where I'm now based,

07:01.680 --> 07:07.040
 I sense a kind of suffocating atmosphere of self censorship

07:07.040 --> 07:12.440
 that means people are afraid to take even minimal risk in class.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.200
 I mean, just take, for example, a survey that

07:15.200 --> 07:17.880
 was published earlier this year that

07:17.880 --> 07:21.400
 revealed this is of undergraduates in four year programs

07:21.400 --> 07:23.720
 in the US.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.520
 85% of self described liberal students

07:26.520 --> 07:29.600
 said they would report a professor to the university

07:29.600 --> 07:32.160
 administration if he or she said something

07:32.160 --> 07:33.760
 they considered offensive.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.520
 And something like 75% said they do it

07:36.520 --> 07:38.040
 to a fellow undergraduate.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.720
 That's the kind of culture that's evolved in our universities.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.760
 So we need a new university in which none of that is true,

07:44.760 --> 07:48.080
 in which you can speak your mind, say stupid things,

07:48.080 --> 07:52.440
 get it completely wrong, and live to tell the tale.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.240
 There's a lot more going on, I think,

07:54.240 --> 07:56.520
 because when you start thinking about what's

07:56.520 --> 07:59.640
 wrong with a modern university, many, many more

07:59.640 --> 08:01.800
 things suggest themselves.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.480
 And I think there's an opportunity here

08:03.480 --> 08:06.960
 to build something that's radically new in some ways

08:06.960 --> 08:10.120
 and radically traditional in other ways.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.840
 For example, I have a strong preference

08:11.840 --> 08:15.400
 for the tutorial system that you see at Oxford and Cambridge,

08:15.400 --> 08:19.240
 which is small group teaching and highly

08:19.240 --> 08:21.120
 Socratic in its structure.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.640
 I think it'd be great to bring that to the United States,

08:23.640 --> 08:25.680
 where it doesn't really exist.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.240
 But at the same time, I think we should

08:27.240 --> 08:30.880
 be doing some very 21st century things,

08:30.880 --> 08:33.960
 making sure that while people are reading and studying

08:33.960 --> 08:36.440
 classic works, they're also going

08:36.440 --> 08:41.680
 to be immersed in the real world of technological innovation,

08:41.680 --> 08:44.280
 a world that you know very well.

08:44.280 --> 08:49.600
 And I'd love to get a synthesis of the ancient and classical,

08:49.600 --> 08:54.560
 which we're gradually letting fade away with the novel

08:54.560 --> 08:55.520
 and technological.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.560
 So we want to produce people who can simultaneously

08:58.560 --> 09:02.480
 talk intelligently about Adam Smith,

09:02.480 --> 09:06.360
 or for that matter, Shakespeare or Proust,

09:06.360 --> 09:11.480
 and have a conversation with you about where AI is going

09:11.480 --> 09:14.880
 and how long it will be before I can get driven here

09:14.880 --> 09:17.560
 by a self driving vehicle, allowing me

09:17.560 --> 09:20.240
 to have my lunch and prepare rather than focus

09:20.240 --> 09:22.280
 on the other crazy people on the road.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.320
 So that's the dream that we can create something

09:25.320 --> 09:29.200
 which is partly classical and partly 21st century.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.120
 And we look around and we don't see it.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.520
 If you don't see an institution that you really

09:33.520 --> 09:36.600
 think should exist, I think you have a more responsibility

09:36.600 --> 09:38.080
 to create it.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.960
 So you're thinking, including something bigger

09:41.960 --> 09:44.360
 than just liberal education, also including science,

09:44.360 --> 09:46.040
 engineering, and technology.

09:46.040 --> 09:50.200
 I should also comment that I mostly

09:50.200 --> 09:52.760
 stay out of politics and out of some

09:52.760 --> 09:55.640
 of these aspects of liberal education

09:55.640 --> 09:57.960
 that's kind of been the most controversial and difficult

09:57.960 --> 09:59.560
 within the university.

09:59.560 --> 10:06.760
 But there is a kind of ripple effect of fear within that space

10:06.760 --> 10:10.520
 into science and engineering and technology

10:10.520 --> 10:15.880
 that I think has a nature that's difficult to describe.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.680
 It doesn't have a controversial nature.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.400
 It just has a nature of fear.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.560
 Where you're not, you mentioned saying stupid stuff

10:22.560 --> 10:29.400
 as a young 20 year old, for example, deep learning,

10:29.400 --> 10:31.880
 machine learning is really popular in the computer

10:31.880 --> 10:35.080
 science now as an approach for creating artificial intelligence

10:35.080 --> 10:36.080
 systems.

10:36.080 --> 10:40.040
 It is controversial in that space

10:40.040 --> 10:43.680
 to say that anything against machine learning,

10:43.680 --> 10:46.120
 saying, sort of exploring ideas that's

10:46.120 --> 10:50.120
 saying this is going to lead to a dead end.

10:50.120 --> 10:54.120
 Now, that takes some guts to do as a young 20 year old

10:54.120 --> 10:57.320
 within a classroom to think like that,

10:57.320 --> 10:59.720
 to raise that question in a machine learning course.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.160
 It sounds ridiculous because it's

11:01.160 --> 11:03.800
 like who's going to complain about this.

11:03.800 --> 11:10.160
 But the fear that starts in a course on history

11:10.160 --> 11:15.320
 or on some course that covers society, the fear ripples

11:15.320 --> 11:18.400
 and affects those students that are asking big out of the box

11:18.400 --> 11:22.200
 questions about engineering, about computer science.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.280
 And there's a lot.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.200
 There's linear algebra that's not going to change.

11:26.200 --> 11:29.720
 But then there's applied linear algebra, machine

11:29.720 --> 11:30.240
 learning.

11:30.240 --> 11:34.920
 And that's when robots and real system touch human beings.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.840
 And that's when you have to ask yourself

11:36.840 --> 11:40.600
 these difficult questions about humanity even

11:40.600 --> 11:43.000
 in the engineering and science and technology courses.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.160
 And these are not separate worlds.

11:45.160 --> 11:48.800
 In two senses, I've just taken delivery

11:48.800 --> 11:51.080
 of my copy of the book that Eric Schmidt and Henry

11:51.080 --> 11:55.000
 Kissinger have coauthored on artificial intelligence.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.960
 The central question of which is, what

11:56.960 --> 11:59.600
 does this mean for us broadly?

11:59.600 --> 12:04.080
 But they're not separate worlds in C.P. Snow's sense

12:04.080 --> 12:07.000
 of the chasm between science and arts.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.200
 Because on a university campus, everything

12:10.200 --> 12:13.600
 is contagious from a novel coronavirus

12:13.600 --> 12:18.360
 to the behaviors occurring in the English department.

12:18.360 --> 12:23.360
 Those behaviors, if denunciation becomes a norm,

12:23.360 --> 12:26.000
 undergraduate denounces professor, teaching assistant

12:26.000 --> 12:28.200
 denounces undergraduate, those behaviors are contagious

12:28.200 --> 12:30.960
 and will spread inexorably first to social science

12:30.960 --> 12:32.440
 and then to natural sciences.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.200
 And I think that's part of the reason

12:35.200 --> 12:37.440
 why when this started to happen, when

12:37.440 --> 12:41.240
 we started to get the origins of disinvitation and cancel

12:41.240 --> 12:45.440
 culture, it was not just a few conservative professors

12:45.440 --> 12:47.240
 in the humanities who had to worry.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.520
 Everybody had to worry.

12:48.520 --> 12:52.080
 Because eventually, it was going to come even

12:52.080 --> 12:57.680
 to the most apparently hard stem part of the campus.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.840
 It's contagious.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.800
 This is something Nicholas Krasnakas should look at,

13:00.800 --> 13:02.720
 because he's very good at looking

13:02.720 --> 13:05.720
 at the way in which social networks, like the ones that

13:05.720 --> 13:08.680
 exist in a university, can spread everything.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.520
 But I think when we look back and ask,

13:10.520 --> 13:14.800
 why did wokeism spread so rapidly and rapidly out

13:14.800 --> 13:17.120
 of humanities into other parts of universities?

13:17.120 --> 13:19.520
 And why did it spread across the country

13:19.520 --> 13:22.880
 and beyond the United States to the other English speaking

13:22.880 --> 13:23.440
 universities?

13:23.440 --> 13:25.640
 It's because it's a contagion.

13:25.640 --> 13:28.480
 And these behaviors are contagious.

13:28.480 --> 13:32.040
 The president of a university, I won't name,

13:32.040 --> 13:36.160
 said to me that he receives every day at least one

13:36.160 --> 13:40.040
 denunciation, one call for somebody or other

13:40.040 --> 13:43.000
 to be fired for something that they said.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.760
 That's the crazy kind of totalitarianism

13:45.760 --> 13:50.480
 light that now exists in our universities.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.720
 And of course, the people who want to downplay this say,

13:52.720 --> 13:54.720
 oh, well, there only have been 100 and something

13:54.720 --> 13:55.760
 in disinvitations.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.880
 Or, oh, there really aren't that many cases.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.920
 But the point is that the famous events, the events that

14:00.920 --> 14:04.240
 get the attention, are responsible for a general

14:04.240 --> 14:07.120
 chilling that, as you say, spreads to every part

14:07.120 --> 14:11.240
 of the university and creates a very familiar culture in which

14:11.240 --> 14:13.440
 people are afraid to say what they think.

14:13.440 --> 14:16.000
 Self censorship, look at the heterodox academy data

14:16.000 --> 14:17.840
 on this, grows and grows.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.720
 So now a majority of students will

14:19.720 --> 14:22.240
 say this is clear from the latest heterodox academy

14:22.240 --> 14:26.320
 surveys, we are scared to say what we think in case we get

14:26.320 --> 14:28.520
 denounced in case we get canceled.

14:28.520 --> 14:31.320
 Well, that's just not the correct atmosphere

14:31.320 --> 14:33.960
 for a university in a free society.

14:33.960 --> 14:38.080
 To me, what's really creepy is how many of the behaviors

14:38.080 --> 14:40.760
 I see on university campuses today

14:40.760 --> 14:42.760
 are reminiscent of the way that people used

14:42.760 --> 14:45.600
 to behave in the Soviet Union or in the Soviet bloc

14:45.600 --> 14:47.280
 or in Maoist China.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.760
 There's sort of totalitarianism light

14:49.760 --> 14:54.000
 that I think we're contending with here, which manifests itself

14:54.000 --> 14:59.720
 as denunciations, people informing on superiors.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.840
 Some people using it for career advantage.

15:02.840 --> 15:07.120
 Other people reduced to hapless, desperate apology

15:07.120 --> 15:09.000
 to try to exonerate themselves.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.480
 People disappearing metaphorically, if not literally.

15:12.480 --> 15:16.120
 All of this is so reminiscent of the totalitarian regimes

15:16.120 --> 15:17.760
 that I studied earlier in my career,

15:17.760 --> 15:20.160
 that it makes me feel sick.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.520
 And what makes me really feel sick

15:21.520 --> 15:23.680
 is that the people doing this stuff,

15:23.680 --> 15:26.520
 the people who write the letters of denunciation,

15:26.520 --> 15:29.280
 are apparently unaware that they're behaving exactly

15:29.280 --> 15:31.200
 like people in Stalin's Soviet Union.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.600
 They don't know that.

15:32.600 --> 15:36.040
 So there's been a massive educational failure.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.480
 If somebody can write an anonymous or nonanonymous

15:38.480 --> 15:41.200
 letter of denunciation and not feel shame,

15:41.200 --> 15:44.600
 I mean, you should feel morally completely contaminated

15:44.600 --> 15:47.560
 as you're doing that, but people haven't been taught

15:47.560 --> 15:49.760
 the realities of totalitarianism.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.600
 For all these reasons, I think you need to try,

15:52.600 --> 15:54.840
 at least to create a new institution

15:54.840 --> 15:59.840
 where those pathologies will be structurally excluded.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.080
 So maybe a difficult question.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.040
 Maybe you'll push back on this,

16:06.040 --> 16:09.160
 but you're widely seen politically as a conservative.

16:09.160 --> 16:12.440
 Hoover Institution is politically conservative.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.880
 What is the role of politics at the University of Austin?

16:15.880 --> 16:18.760
 Because some of the ideas, people listening to this,

16:18.760 --> 16:21.280
 when they hear the ideas you're expressing,

16:21.280 --> 16:23.880
 they may think there's a lean to these ideas.

16:23.880 --> 16:26.120
 There's a conservative lean to these ideas.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.240
 Is there such a lean?

16:28.240 --> 16:30.080
 There will certainly be people who say that

16:30.080 --> 16:34.680
 because the standard mode of trying to discredit

16:34.680 --> 16:36.520
 any new initiative is to say,

16:36.520 --> 16:41.520
 oh, this is a sinister conservative plot.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.560
 But one of our cofounders, Heather Hying,

16:45.560 --> 16:49.120
 is definitely not a conservative.

16:49.120 --> 16:53.240
 She's as committed to the idea of academic freedom as I am.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.680
 But I think on political issues,

16:54.680 --> 16:57.280
 we probably agree on almost nothing.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.920
 And at least I would guess.

16:59.920 --> 17:04.680
 But politics, Max Weber made this point a long time ago,

17:04.680 --> 17:07.280
 that politics really should stop at the threshold

17:07.280 --> 17:09.680
 of the classroom, of the lecture hall.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.880
 And in my career, I've always tried to make sure

17:11.880 --> 17:13.640
 that when I'm teaching,

17:13.640 --> 17:17.920
 it's not clear where I stand politically,

17:17.920 --> 17:19.240
 though of course undergraduates

17:19.240 --> 17:22.080
 and insatiably curiously want to know,

17:22.080 --> 17:24.600
 but it shouldn't be clear from what I say

17:24.600 --> 17:28.000
 because indoctrination on a political basis

17:28.000 --> 17:30.840
 is an abuse of the power of the professor,

17:30.840 --> 17:32.920
 as Weber rightly said.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.920
 So I think one of the key principles

17:35.920 --> 17:38.280
 of the University of Austin will be

17:38.280 --> 17:39.840
 that the Barian principle,

17:39.840 --> 17:44.840
 that politics is not an appropriate subject

17:44.840 --> 17:48.360
 for the lecture hall, for the classroom.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.400
 And we should pursue truth

17:51.400 --> 17:55.440
 and enshrine liberty of thought.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.720
 If that's a political issue, then I can't help you.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.040
 I mean, if you're against freedom of thought,

18:01.040 --> 18:04.840
 then we don't really have much of a discussion to have.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.000
 And clearly there are some people

18:06.000 --> 18:08.240
 who politically seem quite hostile to it.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.960
 But my sense is that there are plenty of people

18:10.960 --> 18:12.400
 on the left in academia.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.440
 I think of that interesting partnership

18:14.440 --> 18:18.200
 between Cornell West and Robbie George,

18:18.200 --> 18:20.440
 which has been institutionalized

18:20.440 --> 18:22.320
 in the Academic Freedom Alliance.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.960
 It's bipartisan this issue.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.320
 It really, really is.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.320
 After all, 50 years ago,

18:27.320 --> 18:30.360
 it was the left that was in favor of free speech.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.880
 The right still has an anti free speech element to it.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.080
 Look how quickly they're out to ban critical race theory.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.480
 Critical race theory won't be banned

18:38.480 --> 18:39.920
 at the University of Texas.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.880
 Wokeism won't be banned.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.000
 Everything will be up for discussion.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.080
 But the rules of engagement will be clear.

18:46.080 --> 18:49.400
 Chicago principles, those will be enforced.

18:49.400 --> 18:53.560
 And if you have to give a lecture on,

18:53.560 --> 18:56.440
 well, let's just take a recent example,

18:56.440 --> 18:57.840
 the Dorian Abbott case.

18:57.840 --> 19:02.080
 If you're giving a lecture on astrophysics,

19:02.080 --> 19:04.800
 but it turns out that in some different venue,

19:04.800 --> 19:08.200
 you express skepticism about affirmative action,

19:08.200 --> 19:09.320
 well, it doesn't matter.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.200
 It's irrelevant.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.080
 We want to know what your thoughts are on astrophysics

19:13.080 --> 19:16.160
 because that's what you're supposed to be giving a lecture on.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.760
 That used to be understood.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.360
 I mean, at the Oxford of the 1980s,

19:19.360 --> 19:22.920
 there were communists and there were ultra Tories.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.840
 At Cambridge, there were people who were so reactionary

19:25.840 --> 19:28.240
 that they celebrated Franco's birthday,

19:28.240 --> 19:30.240
 but they were also out and out communists

19:30.240 --> 19:32.760
 down the road at King's College.

19:32.760 --> 19:36.240
 The understanding was that that kind of intellectual diversity

19:36.240 --> 19:38.920
 was part and parcel of university life.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.040
 And frankly, for an undergraduate,

19:40.040 --> 19:42.040
 it was great fun to cross the road

19:42.040 --> 19:45.360
 and go from outright conservatism,

19:45.360 --> 19:47.720
 ultra Toryism to communism.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.040
 One learns a lot that way.

19:50.040 --> 19:53.080
 But the issue is when you're promoting or hiring

19:53.080 --> 19:57.480
 or tenuring people, their politics is not relevant.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.080
 It really isn't.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.560
 And when it started to become relevant,

20:01.560 --> 20:03.360
 and I remember this coming up

20:03.360 --> 20:06.840
 at the Harvard History Department late in my time there,

20:06.840 --> 20:09.120
 I felt deeply, deeply uneasy

20:09.120 --> 20:11.600
 that we were having conversations

20:11.600 --> 20:15.800
 that amounted to, well, we can't hire ex person

20:15.800 --> 20:20.000
 despite their obvious academic qualifications

20:20.000 --> 20:24.160
 because of some political issue.

20:24.160 --> 20:27.560
 That's not what should happen at a healthy university.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.960
 Some practical questions.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.200
 Will University of Austin be a physical in person university

20:36.200 --> 20:38.120
 or virtual university?

20:38.120 --> 20:42.400
 What are some, in that aspect, where the classroom is?

20:42.400 --> 20:45.800
 It will be a real space institution.

20:46.960 --> 20:50.680
 There may be an online dimension to it

20:50.680 --> 20:52.320
 because there clearly are a lot of things

20:52.320 --> 20:56.400
 that you can do via the internet.

20:56.400 --> 21:00.200
 But the core activity of teaching and learning

21:00.200 --> 21:02.040
 I think requires real space.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.880
 And I've thought about this a long time,

21:03.880 --> 21:07.360
 debated Sebastian Thrun about this many, many years ago

21:07.360 --> 21:09.520
 when he was a complete believer in,

21:09.520 --> 21:11.960
 let's call it the metaversity to go with the metaverse.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.000
 I mean, the metaversity was going to happen, wasn't it?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.880
 But I never really believed in the metaversity.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.960
 I didn't do MOOCs because I just didn't think you'd,

21:19.960 --> 21:22.240
 A, be able to retain the attention,

21:22.240 --> 21:24.600
 B, be able to cope with the scale,

21:24.600 --> 21:27.000
 scaled grading that was involved.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.920
 I think there's a reason universities have been around

21:29.920 --> 21:32.200
 and that they're formed for about a millennium.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.480
 You kinda need to all be in the same place.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.840
 So I think answer to that question

21:36.840 --> 21:39.920
 definitely a campus in the Austin area,

21:39.920 --> 21:41.720
 that's where we'll start.

21:41.720 --> 21:45.080
 And if we can allow some of our content

21:45.080 --> 21:48.520
 to be available online, great, we'll certainly do that.

21:48.520 --> 21:49.920
 Another question is,

21:49.920 --> 21:52.480
 what kind of courses and programming will it offer?

21:52.480 --> 21:54.080
 Is that something you can speak to?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.680
 What's your vision here?

21:55.680 --> 22:00.440
 We think that we need to begin more like a startup

22:00.440 --> 22:05.040
 than like a full service university from day one.

22:05.040 --> 22:08.200
 So our vision is that we start with a summer school,

22:09.280 --> 22:12.440
 which will offer provocatively the forbidden courses.

22:12.440 --> 22:17.440
 We want, I think to begin by giving a platform

22:18.400 --> 22:21.840
 to the professors who've been most subject

22:21.840 --> 22:23.920
 to council culture and also to give an opportunity

22:23.920 --> 22:25.720
 to students who want to hear them to come.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.680
 So we'll start with a summer school that will be

22:28.680 --> 22:32.240
 somewhat in the tradition of those institutions

22:32.240 --> 22:34.760
 in the interwar period that were havens for refugees.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.320
 So we're dealing here with the internal refugees

22:37.320 --> 22:39.720
 of the work era.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.360
 We'll start there.

22:41.360 --> 22:45.440
 It'll be an opportunity to test out some content,

22:45.440 --> 22:50.440
 see what students will come and spend time in Austin to hear.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.440
 So that's part A.

22:52.440 --> 22:56.080
 That's the sort of, if you like the launch product.

22:56.080 --> 23:00.240
 And then we go straight to a master's program.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.320
 I don't think you can go to undergraduate education

23:03.320 --> 23:06.600
 right away because the established brands

23:06.600 --> 23:09.200
 in undergraduate education are offering something

23:09.200 --> 23:10.960
 it's impossible to compete with initially

23:10.960 --> 23:14.800
 because they have the brand Harvard, Yale, Stanford

23:14.800 --> 23:17.920
 and they offer also this peer network,

23:18.960 --> 23:21.640
 which is part of the reason people want so badly

23:21.640 --> 23:22.720
 to go to those places.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.480
 Not really the professors, it's the classmates.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.120
 So we don't want to compete there initially.

23:28.120 --> 23:31.160
 Where there is, I think room for new entrants

23:31.160 --> 23:34.920
 is in a master's program.

23:34.920 --> 23:39.440
 And the first one will be in entrepreneurship and leadership

23:39.440 --> 23:43.120
 because I think there is a huge hunger amongst people

23:43.120 --> 23:45.960
 who want to get into particularly the technology world

23:45.960 --> 23:47.040
 to learn about those things.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.800
 And they know they're not really going to learn

23:48.800 --> 23:50.720
 about the business schools.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.080
 The people who are not going to teach them leadership

23:53.080 --> 23:55.480
 and entrepreneurship are professors.

23:55.480 --> 23:59.400
 So we want to create something that will be a little like

23:59.400 --> 24:02.600
 the very successful Schwarzman program in China,

24:02.600 --> 24:05.080
 which was come and spend a year in China

24:05.080 --> 24:07.480
 and find out about China.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.440
 We'll be doing the same essentially saying

24:09.440 --> 24:12.240
 come and spend a year and find out about technology

24:12.240 --> 24:15.120
 and there'll be a mix of academic content.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.880
 We want people to understand some of the first principles

24:17.880 --> 24:19.440
 of what they're studying.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.600
 There are first principles of entrepreneurship

24:21.600 --> 24:24.120
 and leadership, but we also want them to spend time with

24:24.120 --> 24:26.360
 people like one of our co founders, Joe Lonsdale,

24:26.360 --> 24:29.720
 who's been a hugely successful venture capitalist

24:29.720 --> 24:33.200
 and learn directly from people like him.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.760
 So that's the kind of initial offering.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.680
 I think there are other master's programs

24:37.680 --> 24:39.840
 that we will look to roll out quite quickly.

24:39.840 --> 24:43.520
 I have a particular passion for a master's in applied history

24:43.520 --> 24:45.480
 or politics in applied history.

24:45.480 --> 24:48.680
 I'm a historian driven crazy by the tendency

24:48.680 --> 24:50.920
 of academic historians to drift away

24:50.920 --> 24:53.680
 from what seemed to me the important questions

24:53.680 --> 24:56.400
 and certainly to drift away from addressing

24:56.400 --> 24:57.840
 policy relevant questions.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.080
 So I would love to be involved in a master's

25:01.080 --> 25:02.760
 in applied history.

25:02.760 --> 25:06.000
 And we'll build some programs like that

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
 before we get to the full liberal arts experience

25:11.480 --> 25:15.000
 that we envisage for an undergraduate program.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.080
 And that undergraduate program is an exciting one

25:17.080 --> 25:19.680
 because I think we can be innovative there too.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.680
 I would say two years would be spent doing

25:22.680 --> 25:26.640
 some very classical and difficult classical things,

25:26.640 --> 25:30.960
 bridging those old divides between arts and sciences.

25:30.960 --> 25:34.920
 But then there would also be in the second half

25:34.920 --> 25:37.520
 in the junior and senior years,

25:37.520 --> 25:41.080
 something somewhat more of an apprenticeship

25:41.080 --> 25:42.520
 where we'll have centers,

25:42.520 --> 25:45.600
 including a center for technology,

25:45.600 --> 25:49.120
 engineering, mathematics that will be designed

25:49.120 --> 25:53.120
 to help people make that transition from the theoretical

25:53.120 --> 25:54.800
 to the practical.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.000
 So that's the vision.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
 And I think like any early stage idea

26:02.000 --> 26:04.240
 will doubtless tweak it as we go along,

26:04.240 --> 26:07.360
 we'll find things that work and things that don't work.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.360
 But I have a very clear sense in my own mind

26:10.360 --> 26:14.000
 of how this should look five years from now.

26:14.000 --> 26:14.840
 And I don't know about you.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.800
 I mean, I'm unusual as an academic

26:16.800 --> 26:18.800
 because I quite like starting new institutions

26:18.800 --> 26:22.320
 and I've done a bit of it in my career.

26:22.320 --> 26:25.200
 You gotta kind of know what it should look like

26:25.200 --> 26:27.160
 after the first four or five years

26:27.160 --> 26:28.680
 to get out of bed in the morning

26:28.680 --> 26:31.920
 and put up with all the kind of hassles of doing it,

26:31.920 --> 26:35.960
 not least the inevitable flak that we're bound to take

26:35.960 --> 26:38.120
 from the educational establishment.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.960
 And I was graciously invited to be an advisor

26:41.960 --> 26:45.320
 to this University of Austin.

26:45.320 --> 26:50.320
 And the reason I would love to help in whatever way I can

26:51.840 --> 26:52.840
 is several.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.480
 So one, I would love to see Austin,

26:55.480 --> 26:59.000
 the physical location flourish intellectually

26:59.000 --> 27:03.440
 and especially in the space of science and engineering.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.440
 That's really exciting to me.

27:05.440 --> 27:09.840
 Another reason is I am still a research scientist at MIT.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.560
 I still love MIT.

27:12.560 --> 27:16.760
 And I see this effort that you're launching

27:16.760 --> 27:21.200
 as a beacon that leads the way

27:21.200 --> 27:24.440
 to the other elite institutions in the world.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.480
 I think too many of my colleagues

27:26.480 --> 27:30.120
 and especially in robotics kind of see,

27:31.800 --> 27:35.080
 don't see robotics as a humanities problem.

27:35.080 --> 27:40.080
 But to me, robotics and AI will define much of our world

27:43.840 --> 27:45.280
 in the next century.

27:45.280 --> 27:49.680
 And not to consider all the deep psychological,

27:49.680 --> 27:53.760
 sociological, human problems associated with that.

27:54.960 --> 27:58.880
 To have real open conversations, to say stupid things,

27:58.880 --> 28:05.080
 to challenge the ideas of how companies are being run,

28:05.080 --> 28:08.160
 for example, that is the safe space.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.520
 It's very difficult to talk about the difficult questions

28:11.520 --> 28:14.400
 about technology when you're employed by Facebook

28:14.400 --> 28:16.120
 or Google and so on.

28:16.120 --> 28:19.440
 The university is the place to have those conversations.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.280
 That's right.

28:20.280 --> 28:22.400
 And we're hugely excited that you want to be

28:22.400 --> 28:23.320
 one of our advisors.

28:23.320 --> 28:28.320
 We need a broad and an eclectic group of people.

28:28.320 --> 28:33.240
 And I'm excited by the way that group has developed.

28:33.240 --> 28:37.400
 It has some of my favorite intellectuals are there,

28:37.400 --> 28:40.160
 Steve Pinker, for example.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.720
 But we're also making sure that we have people

28:43.720 --> 28:47.920
 with experience in academic leadership.

28:48.840 --> 28:53.920
 And so it's a happy coalition of the willing

28:53.920 --> 28:56.480
 looking to try to build something new,

28:56.480 --> 28:58.720
 which as you say will be complimentary

28:58.720 --> 29:02.120
 to the existing and established institutions.

29:02.120 --> 29:06.080
 I think of the academic world as a network.

29:06.080 --> 29:11.080
 I've moved from some major hubs in the network to others.

29:11.960 --> 29:15.720
 But I've always felt that we do our best work,

29:15.720 --> 29:18.240
 not in a silo called Oxford,

29:18.240 --> 29:22.880
 but in a silo that is really a hub connected to Stanford,

29:22.880 --> 29:26.520
 Harvard connected to Harvard, connected to MIT.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.320
 One of the reasons I moved to the United States

29:28.320 --> 29:32.320
 was that I sensed that there was more intellectual action

29:32.320 --> 29:35.760
 in my original field of expertise, financial history.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.280
 And that was right.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.000
 It was a good move.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.040
 I think I'd have stagnated if I'd stayed at Oxford.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.400
 But at the same time, I haven't lost connection with Oxford.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.800
 I recently went and gave a lecture there

29:48.800 --> 29:50.480
 in honor of Sir Roger Scruton,

29:50.480 --> 29:52.840
 one of the great conservative philosophers.

29:52.840 --> 29:57.840
 And the burden of my lecture was the idea of the Anglosphere,

29:58.040 --> 30:02.120
 which appealed a lot to Roger, will go horribly wrong

30:02.120 --> 30:05.920
 if illiberal ideas that inhibit academic freedom

30:05.920 --> 30:07.800
 spread all over the Anglosphere.

30:07.800 --> 30:11.480
 And this network gets infected with these,

30:11.480 --> 30:15.000
 I think deeply damaging notions.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.520
 So yeah, I think we're creating a new node.

30:18.520 --> 30:21.760
 I hope it's a node that makes the network overall

30:21.760 --> 30:23.320
 more resilient.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.840
 And right now, there's an urgent need for it.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.320
 I mean, there are people

30:27.320 --> 30:30.320
 whose academic careers have been terminated.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.800
 I'll name two who are involved, Peter Bogossian,

30:33.800 --> 30:37.680
 who was harassed out of Portland State

30:37.680 --> 30:42.680
 for the reason that he was one of those intrepid figures

30:43.040 --> 30:47.040
 who carried out the grievance studies, hoaxes,

30:47.040 --> 30:50.560
 exposing the utter charlatanry going on

30:50.560 --> 30:53.040
 in many supposedly academic journals

30:53.040 --> 30:57.000
 by getting phony gender studies articles published.

30:57.000 --> 30:57.840
 It was genius.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.920
 And of course, so put the noses out of joint

31:00.920 --> 31:03.480
 of the academic establishment that he began to be subject

31:03.480 --> 31:05.280
 to disciplinary actions.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.280
 So Peter is going to be involved.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.280
 And in a recent shocking British case,

31:10.280 --> 31:12.920
 the philosopher Kathleen Stock has essentially been run off

31:12.920 --> 31:15.520
 the campus of Sussex University in England

31:15.520 --> 31:20.520
 for violating the increasingly complex rules

31:21.320 --> 31:26.200
 about discussing transgender issues and women's rights.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.280
 She will be one of our advisors.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.720
 And I think also one of our founding fellows

31:30.720 --> 31:35.040
 actually teaching for us in our first iteration.

31:35.040 --> 31:38.600
 So I think we're creating a node that's badly needed.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.800
 Those people, I mean, I remember saying this

31:40.800 --> 31:44.120
 to the other founders when we first began

31:44.120 --> 31:48.200
 to talk about this idea to Barry Weiss

31:48.200 --> 31:52.680
 and to Pano Kanellos as well as to Heather Hying.

31:52.680 --> 31:55.000
 We need to do this urgently

31:55.000 --> 31:56.920
 because there are people whose livelihoods

31:56.920 --> 31:58.800
 are in fact being destroyed

31:58.800 --> 32:02.600
 by these extraordinarily illiberal campaigns against them.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.080
 And so there's no time to hang around

32:05.080 --> 32:07.360
 and come up with the perfect design.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.160
 This is an urgently needed lifeboat.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.600
 And let's start with that.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.600
 And then we can build something spectacular,

32:13.600 --> 32:16.680
 taking advantage of the fact that all of these people have,

32:16.680 --> 32:19.200
 well, they now have very real skin in the game.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.720
 They need to make this a success

32:21.720 --> 32:24.520
 and I'm sure they will help us make it a success.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.640
 So you mentioned some interesting names

32:27.640 --> 32:30.400
 like Heather Hying, Barry Weiss and so on.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.160
 Steven Pinker, somebody I really admire

32:32.160 --> 32:35.200
 and he too was under quite a lot of fire.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.280
 Many reasons I admire him, one,

32:38.280 --> 32:40.560
 because of his optimism about the future

32:40.560 --> 32:44.520
 and two, how little of a dam he seems to give

32:45.840 --> 32:48.000
 about walking through the fire.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.320
 There's nobody more zen about walking through the fire

32:50.320 --> 32:51.320
 than Steven Pinker.

32:51.320 --> 32:54.200
 But anyway, you mentioned a lot of interesting names.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.920
 Jonathan Hight is also interesting there.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.880
 Who is involved with this venture at these early days?

33:00.880 --> 33:04.760
 Well, one of the things that I'm excited about

33:04.760 --> 33:07.560
 is that we're getting people from inside

33:07.560 --> 33:09.200
 and outside the academic world.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.880
 So we've got Arthur Brooks, who for many years

33:12.880 --> 33:17.640
 ran the American Enterprise Institute very successfully,

33:17.640 --> 33:20.000
 has a Harvard role now teaching.

33:20.760 --> 33:23.720
 And so he's somebody who brings, I think,

33:23.720 --> 33:25.200
 a different perspective.

33:26.720 --> 33:31.720
 There's obviously a need to get experienced

33:33.440 --> 33:37.480
 academic leaders involved, which is why I was

33:37.480 --> 33:39.480
 talking to Larry Summers about

33:39.480 --> 33:43.520
 whether he would join our Board of Advisors.

33:43.520 --> 33:46.920
 The Chicago principals owe a debt

33:46.920 --> 33:50.200
 to the former president of Chicago

33:50.200 --> 33:54.160
 and he's graciously agreed to be in the Board of Advisors.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.240
 I could go on, it would become a long and tedious list.

33:56.240 --> 34:01.240
 But my goal in trying to get this happy ban to form

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
 has been to signal that it's a bipartisan endeavor.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.400
 It is not a conservative institution

34:08.400 --> 34:09.320
 that we're trying to build.

34:09.320 --> 34:12.240
 It's an institution that's committed to academic freedom

34:12.240 --> 34:15.720
 and the pursuit of truth that will mean it

34:15.720 --> 34:20.400
 when it takes Robert Zimmer's Chicago principals

34:20.400 --> 34:22.880
 and enshrines them in its founding charter

34:22.880 --> 34:26.520
 and will make those something other than honored

34:26.520 --> 34:29.680
 in the breach, which they seem to be at some institutions.

34:29.680 --> 34:33.360
 So the idea here is to grow this organically.

34:33.360 --> 34:36.640
 We need, rather like the academic freedom alliance

34:36.640 --> 34:39.120
 that Robbie George created earlier this year,

34:39.120 --> 34:41.440
 we need breadth and we need to show

34:41.440 --> 34:45.560
 that this is not some kind of institutionalization

34:45.560 --> 34:47.640
 of the intellectual dark web,

34:47.640 --> 34:52.480
 though we welcome founding members of that nebulous body.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.480
 It's really something designed for Olive academia

34:55.480 --> 34:57.320
 to provide a kind of reboot

34:57.320 --> 35:00.280
 that I think we all agree is needed.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.440
 Is there a George Washington type figure

35:02.440 --> 35:04.600
 who's, is there a president elected yet

35:04.600 --> 35:07.320
 or who's going to lead this institution?

35:07.320 --> 35:10.240
 Hanna Canellos, the former president of St. John's

35:10.240 --> 35:12.440
 is the president of University of Austin.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.440
 And so he is our George Washington.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.040
 I don't know who Alexander Hamilton is.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.640
 I'll lead you to guess.

35:18.640 --> 35:21.880
 It's funny you mentioned IDW, Intellectual Dark Web.

35:21.880 --> 35:26.880
 Have you talked to your friend Sam Harris about any of this?

35:26.880 --> 35:30.760
 He is another person I really admire

35:30.760 --> 35:34.560
 and I've talked to online and offline quite a bit

35:34.560 --> 35:39.240
 for not belonging to any tribe.

35:39.240 --> 35:43.080
 He stands boldly on his convictions

35:43.080 --> 35:46.120
 when he knows they're not going to be popular

35:46.120 --> 35:50.680
 with like he basically gets canceled by every group.

35:50.680 --> 35:54.320
 He sort of, he doesn't shy away from controversy

35:54.320 --> 35:57.040
 and not for the sake of controversy itself.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.280
 He is one of the best examples to me

36:00.280 --> 36:02.640
 of a person who thinks freely.

36:02.640 --> 36:06.080
 I disagree with him on a few, quite a few things,

36:06.080 --> 36:10.840
 but I deeply admire that he is what it looks like

36:10.840 --> 36:12.800
 to think freely by himself.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.360
 It feels to me like he represents a lot of the ideals

36:15.360 --> 36:16.560
 of this kind of effort.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.520
 Yes, he would be a natural fit.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.440
 Sam, if you're listening, I hope you're in.

36:21.440 --> 36:25.680
 I think in the course of his recent intellectual quests,

36:25.680 --> 36:28.120
 he did collide with one of our founders, Heather Hying.

36:28.120 --> 36:31.040
 So we'll have to model civil disagreement

36:31.040 --> 36:32.600
 at the University of Austin.

36:32.600 --> 36:35.560
 It's extremely important that we should all disagree

36:35.560 --> 36:38.880
 about many things, but do it amicably.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.160
 One of the things that has been lost sight of,

36:41.160 --> 36:42.840
 perhaps it's all the fault of Twitter

36:42.840 --> 36:44.320
 or maybe it's something more profound,

36:44.320 --> 36:47.680
 is that it is possible to disagree in a civil way

36:47.680 --> 36:49.680
 and still be friends.

36:49.680 --> 36:52.040
 I certainly had friends at Oxford

36:52.040 --> 36:54.480
 who were far to the left of me politically

36:54.480 --> 36:56.520
 and they are still among my best friends.

36:56.520 --> 36:58.640
 So the University of Austin has to be a place

36:58.640 --> 37:03.360
 where we can disagree vehemently,

37:03.360 --> 37:06.560
 but we can then go and have a beer afterwards.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.760
 That's, in my mind, a really important part

37:09.760 --> 37:12.840
 of university life, learning the difference

37:12.840 --> 37:15.680
 between the political and the personal.

37:15.680 --> 37:18.440
 So Sam is, I think, a good example,

37:18.440 --> 37:23.440
 as a you of a certain kind of intellectual hero

37:23.440 --> 37:28.440
 who has been willing to go into the cyber sphere,

37:31.120 --> 37:36.120
 the metaverse and carve out an intellectual space,

37:37.520 --> 37:42.520
 the podcast and debate everything fearlessly.

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
 His essay, it was really an essay on Black Lives Matter

37:48.320 --> 37:50.880
 and the question of police racism

37:50.880 --> 37:54.400
 was a masterpiece of 2020.

37:54.400 --> 37:59.400
 And so he, I think, is a model of what we believe in,

38:01.360 --> 38:03.840
 but we can't save the world with podcasts,

38:03.840 --> 38:06.920
 good though yours is,

38:06.920 --> 38:11.920
 because there's a kind of solo element

38:11.920 --> 38:15.120
 to this form of public intellectual activities.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.800
 It's also there in Substack

38:16.800 --> 38:19.920
 where all our best writers now seem to be

38:19.920 --> 38:22.640
 including our founder Barry Weiss.

38:22.640 --> 38:26.920
 The danger with this approach is ultimately

38:26.920 --> 38:30.440
 your subscribers are the people who already agree with you

38:30.440 --> 38:35.440
 and we are all therefore in danger of preaching to the choir.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.240
 I think what makes an institution like University of Austin

38:38.240 --> 38:40.760
 so attractive is that we get everybody together

38:42.000 --> 38:43.600
 at least part of the year

38:44.480 --> 38:49.480
 and we do that informal interaction at lunch,

38:49.480 --> 38:54.480
 at dinner that allows in my experience

38:54.720 --> 38:57.400
 the best ideas to form.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.520
 Intellectual activity isn't really a solo voyage.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.480
 Historians often make it seem that way,

39:02.480 --> 39:06.040
 but I've realized over time that I do my best work

39:06.040 --> 39:08.200
 in a collaborative way

39:08.200 --> 39:10.680
 and scientists have been better at this

39:10.680 --> 39:12.480
 than people in the humanities.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.800
 But what really matters,

39:13.800 --> 39:16.160
 what's magical about a good university

39:16.160 --> 39:19.520
 is that interdisciplinary serendipitous conversation

39:19.520 --> 39:21.480
 that happens on campus.

39:21.480 --> 39:24.560
 Tom Sargent, the great Nobel Prize winning economist

39:24.560 --> 39:27.840
 and I used to have these kind of random conversations

39:27.840 --> 39:31.560
 in elevators at NYU or in corridors at Stanford.

39:31.560 --> 39:34.720
 And sometimes they'd be quite short conversations

39:34.720 --> 39:38.080
 but in that short serendipitous exchange

39:38.080 --> 39:40.560
 I would have more intellectual stimulus

39:40.560 --> 39:44.440
 than in many a seminar lasting an hour and a half.

39:44.440 --> 39:47.320
 So I think we want to get the Sam Harris's

39:47.320 --> 39:51.480
 and Lex Friedman's out of their darkened rooms

39:51.480 --> 39:54.040
 and give them a chance to interact

39:54.040 --> 39:59.040
 in a much less structured way than we've got used to.

39:59.400 --> 40:03.080
 Again, it's that sense that sometimes you need

40:03.080 --> 40:05.640
 some freewheeling unstructured debate

40:05.640 --> 40:07.360
 to get the really good ideas.

40:07.360 --> 40:08.960
 I mean, to talk anecdotally for a moment,

40:08.960 --> 40:12.080
 I look back on my Oxford undergraduate experience

40:12.080 --> 40:13.520
 and I wrote a lot of essays

40:13.520 --> 40:14.720
 and attended a lot of classes

40:14.720 --> 40:18.200
 but intellectually the most important thing I did

40:18.200 --> 40:22.400
 was to write an essay on the Viennese satirist Carl Krause

40:22.400 --> 40:27.400
 for an undergraduate discussion group called The Canning Club.

40:27.480 --> 40:30.000
 And I probably put more work into that paper

40:30.000 --> 40:31.520
 than I put into anything else

40:31.520 --> 40:33.840
 except maybe my final examinations.

40:33.840 --> 40:36.640
 Even although there was only really one senior member

40:36.640 --> 40:38.840
 present, the historian Jeremy Cato,

40:38.840 --> 40:41.920
 I was really just trying to impress my contemporaries.

40:41.920 --> 40:45.760
 And that's the kind of thing we want.

40:45.760 --> 40:47.920
 The great intellectuals,

40:47.920 --> 40:51.120
 the great intellectual leaps forward occurred,

40:51.120 --> 40:54.200
 often in somewhat unstructured settings.

40:54.200 --> 40:57.240
 I'm from Scotland, you can tell from my accent

40:57.240 --> 40:58.320
 a little at least.

40:59.600 --> 41:03.080
 The enlightenment happened in late 18th century Scotland

41:03.080 --> 41:07.320
 in a very interesting interplay between the universities

41:07.320 --> 41:09.040
 which were very important,

41:09.040 --> 41:13.440
 Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews and the coffee houses

41:13.440 --> 41:16.800
 and pubs of the Scottish cities

41:16.800 --> 41:19.800
 where a lot of unstructured discussion

41:19.800 --> 41:24.120
 often fueled by copious amounts of wine took place.

41:24.120 --> 41:27.320
 That's what I've missed over the last few years.

41:27.320 --> 41:31.120
 Let's just think about how hard academic social life

41:31.120 --> 41:35.080
 has become that we've reached the point

41:35.080 --> 41:40.080
 that Amy Tua becomes the object of a full blown investigation

41:41.600 --> 41:46.600
 and media storm for inviting two Yale Law School students

41:47.200 --> 41:49.960
 over to her house to talk.

41:50.840 --> 41:51.840
 I mean, when I was at Oxford,

41:51.840 --> 41:54.840
 it was regarded as a tremendous honor to be asked

41:54.840 --> 41:58.080
 to go to one of our tutors homes.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.680
 The social life of Oxford and Cambridge

41:59.680 --> 42:01.120
 is one of their great strengths.

42:01.120 --> 42:05.160
 There's a sort of requirement to sip unpleasant sherry

42:05.160 --> 42:08.360
 with the dons and we've kind of killed all that.

42:08.360 --> 42:09.560
 We've killed all that in the US

42:09.560 --> 42:12.160
 because nobody dares have a social interaction

42:12.160 --> 42:15.320
 with an undergraduate or exchange an informal email

42:15.320 --> 42:17.360
 in case the whole thing ends up on the front page

42:17.360 --> 42:19.520
 of the local or student newspaper.

42:19.520 --> 42:22.040
 So that's what we need to kind of restore

42:22.040 --> 42:25.560
 the social life of academia.

42:25.560 --> 42:26.400
 So there's magic.

42:26.400 --> 42:29.360
 We didn't really address this sort of explicitly

42:29.360 --> 42:33.520
 but there's magic to the interaction between students.

42:33.520 --> 42:37.440
 There's magic in the interaction between faculty,

42:37.440 --> 42:39.200
 the people that teach and there's the magic

42:39.200 --> 42:41.640
 in the interaction between the students and the faculty

42:41.640 --> 42:43.840
 and it's an iterative process

42:43.840 --> 42:46.080
 that changes everybody involved.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.960
 So it's like world experts in a particular discipline

42:48.960 --> 42:52.760
 are changed as much as the students.

42:52.760 --> 42:56.960
 As the 20 year olds with the wild ideas,

42:56.960 --> 42:59.160
 each are changed and that's the magic of it.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.240
 And that applies in liberal education

43:01.240 --> 43:03.600
 that applies in the sciences too.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.640
 That's probably maybe you can speak to this

43:05.640 --> 43:08.840
 why so much scientific innovation

43:08.840 --> 43:10.720
 has happened in universities.

43:10.720 --> 43:13.680
 There's something about the youthful energy

43:13.680 --> 43:16.560
 of like young minds, graduate students

43:16.560 --> 43:19.160
 and the graduate students that inspire some of the world

43:19.160 --> 43:22.080
 experts to do some of the best work of their lives.

43:22.080 --> 43:25.200
 Well, the human brain we know is at its most dynamic

43:25.200 --> 43:27.360
 when people are pretty young.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.680
 You know this with your background in math.

43:29.680 --> 43:33.040
 People don't get better at math after the age of 30.

43:33.040 --> 43:36.880
 And this is important when you think about

43:36.880 --> 43:39.880
 the intergenerational character of university.

43:39.880 --> 43:44.280
 The older people, the professors have the experience

43:44.280 --> 43:46.880
 but they're fading intellectually

43:46.880 --> 43:50.280
 from much earlier than anybody really wants to admit.

43:50.280 --> 43:55.280
 And so you get this intellectual shot in the arm

43:55.280 --> 43:59.360
 from hanging out with people who are circa 20,

43:59.360 --> 44:04.280
 don't know shit, but brains are kind of like cooking.

44:04.280 --> 44:07.400
 I look back on the career I've had in teaching

44:07.400 --> 44:11.920
 which is over 25 years where Cambridge, Oxford, NYU, Harvard

44:11.920 --> 44:15.520
 and I have extremely strong relationships

44:15.520 --> 44:19.440
 with students from those institutions

44:19.440 --> 44:24.440
 because they would show up whether it was at office hours

44:24.440 --> 44:28.200
 or in tutorials and disagree with me.

44:28.200 --> 44:31.880
 And for me, it's always been about encouraging

44:31.880 --> 44:35.960
 some active intellectual rebellion, telling people

44:35.960 --> 44:38.800
 I don't want your essay to echo my views.

44:38.800 --> 44:41.840
 If you can find something wrong with what I wrote, great.

44:41.840 --> 44:45.440
 Or if you can find something I missed that's new, fantastic.

44:45.440 --> 44:47.720
 So there is definitely, as you said, a magic

44:47.720 --> 44:49.920
 in that interaction across the generations.

44:49.920 --> 44:53.360
 And it's extraordinarily difficult I think

44:53.360 --> 44:57.280
 for an intellectual to make the same progress

44:57.280 --> 45:01.880
 in a project, in isolation, compared with the progress

45:01.880 --> 45:05.880
 that can be made in these very special communities.

45:05.880 --> 45:09.360
 What does a university do amongst other things?

45:09.360 --> 45:13.160
 It creates a somewhat artificial environment

45:13.160 --> 45:15.320
 of abnormal job security.

45:15.320 --> 45:18.600
 That's the whole idea of giving people tenure.

45:18.600 --> 45:22.680
 And then a relatively high turnover, new faces each year.

45:22.680 --> 45:27.120
 And an institutionalization of thought experiments

45:27.120 --> 45:29.040
 and actual experiments.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.040
 And then you get everybody living in the same kind

45:31.040 --> 45:34.720
 of vicinity so that it can spill over into 3AM conversation.

45:34.720 --> 45:37.480
 Well, that always seems to me to be

45:37.480 --> 45:39.240
 a pretty potent combination.

45:39.240 --> 45:41.760
 Let's ask ourselves a counterfactual question next.

45:41.760 --> 45:47.560
 Let's imagine that the world wars happen,

45:47.560 --> 45:51.320
 but there are no universities.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.960
 I mean, how does the Manhattan Project

45:52.960 --> 45:58.200
 happen with no academia to take just one of many examples?

45:58.200 --> 46:01.200
 In truth, how does Britain even stay in the war

46:01.200 --> 46:04.600
 without Bletchley Park, without being

46:04.600 --> 46:08.480
 able to crack the German cipher?

46:08.480 --> 46:12.320
 The academics are unsung, partly sung

46:12.320 --> 46:15.240
 heroes of these conflicts.

46:15.240 --> 46:16.960
 The same is true in the Soviet Union.

46:16.960 --> 46:20.600
 The Soviet Union was a terribly evil and repressive system,

46:20.600 --> 46:22.320
 but it was good at science.

46:22.320 --> 46:27.320
 And that kept it in the game not only in World War II,

46:27.320 --> 46:28.880
 it kept it in the Cold War.

46:28.880 --> 46:33.880
 So it's clear that universities are incredibly powerful,

46:33.880 --> 46:36.520
 intellectual force multipliers.

46:36.520 --> 46:41.160
 And our history without them would look very different.

46:41.160 --> 46:43.280
 Sure, some innovations would have happened without them.

46:43.280 --> 46:43.760
 That's clear.

46:43.760 --> 46:46.040
 The Industrial Revolution didn't need universities.

46:46.040 --> 46:48.360
 In fact, they played a very marginal role

46:48.360 --> 46:49.880
 in the key technological breakthroughs

46:49.880 --> 46:53.000
 of the Industrial Revolution in its first phase.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
 But by the second Industrial Revolution

46:55.000 --> 46:57.520
 in the late 19th century, the German industry

46:57.520 --> 46:59.720
 would not have leapt ahead of British industry

46:59.720 --> 47:02.480
 if the universities had not been superior.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.120
 And it was the fact that the Germans institutionalized

47:05.120 --> 47:08.680
 scientific research in the way that they did that really

47:08.680 --> 47:12.200
 produced a powerful, powerful advantage.

47:12.200 --> 47:15.760
 The problem was that this is a really interesting point

47:15.760 --> 47:18.120
 that Friedrich Meinecke makes in die Deutsche

47:18.120 --> 47:20.560
 Katastrophe for the German catastrophe.

47:20.560 --> 47:23.840
 The German intellectuals became technocrats,

47:23.840 --> 47:25.600
 homophobic, he says.

47:25.600 --> 47:28.720
 They knew a great deal about their speciality,

47:28.720 --> 47:32.480
 but they were alienated from, broadly speaking, humanism.

47:32.480 --> 47:34.800
 And that is his explanation, or one of his explanations,

47:34.800 --> 47:37.400
 for why this very scientifically advanced

47:37.400 --> 47:42.120
 Germany goes down the path of hell led by Hitler.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.920
 So when I come back and ask myself,

47:43.920 --> 47:47.840
 what is it that we want to do with a new university,

47:47.840 --> 47:52.800
 we want to make sure that we don't fall into that German pit

47:52.800 --> 47:55.720
 where very high levels of technical and scientific

47:55.720 --> 48:00.960
 expertise are decoupled from the fundamental foundations

48:00.960 --> 48:04.320
 of a free society.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.800
 So liberal arts are there, I think,

48:05.800 --> 48:09.760
 to stop the scientists making faustian pacts.

48:09.760 --> 48:12.080
 And that's why it's really important that people working

48:12.080 --> 48:15.520
 on AI reach Shakespeare.

48:15.520 --> 48:19.600
 I think you said that academics are unsung heroes

48:19.600 --> 48:21.760
 of the 20th century.

48:21.760 --> 48:27.840
 I think there's kind of a lazy intellectual desire

48:27.840 --> 48:31.040
 to kind of destroy the academics,

48:31.040 --> 48:33.440
 that the academics are the source of all problems

48:33.440 --> 48:34.840
 in the world.

48:34.840 --> 48:37.520
 And I personally believe that, exactly as you said,

48:37.520 --> 48:41.320
 we need to recognize that the university is probably

48:41.320 --> 48:46.520
 where the ideas that will protect us from the catastrophes

48:46.520 --> 48:50.960
 that are looming ahead of us, that's

48:50.960 --> 48:52.760
 where those ideas are going to come from.

48:52.760 --> 48:56.920
 People who work on economics can argue back and forth

48:56.920 --> 48:59.520
 about John Maynard Keynes.

48:59.520 --> 49:00.960
 But I think it's pretty clear that he

49:00.960 --> 49:03.640
 was the most important economist and certainly

49:03.640 --> 49:06.600
 the most influential economist of the 20th century.

49:06.600 --> 49:11.320
 And I think his ideas are looking better today

49:11.320 --> 49:12.960
 in the wake of the financial crisis

49:12.960 --> 49:15.840
 than they have at any time since the 1970s.

49:15.840 --> 49:19.920
 But imagine John Maynard Keynes without Cambridge.

49:19.920 --> 49:22.800
 You can't, because someone like that

49:22.800 --> 49:29.480
 doesn't actually exist without the incredible hot house

49:29.480 --> 49:31.880
 that a place like Cambridge was in Keynes's life.

49:31.880 --> 49:36.400
 He was a product of a kind of hereditary intellectual elite.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.920
 He had its vices.

49:37.920 --> 49:41.840
 But you can't help but admire the sheer power of the mind.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.160
 I've spent a lot of my career reading Keynes

49:44.160 --> 49:46.680
 and I revere that intellect.

49:46.680 --> 49:49.440
 It's so, so powerful.

49:49.440 --> 49:51.560
 But you can't have people like that

49:51.560 --> 49:55.720
 if you're not prepared to have King's College, Cambridge.

49:55.720 --> 49:57.040
 And it comes with redundancy.

49:57.040 --> 49:57.920
 I think that's the point.

49:57.920 --> 49:59.480
 There are lots and lots of things

49:59.480 --> 50:02.320
 that are very annoying about academic life

50:02.320 --> 50:05.280
 that you just have to deal with.

50:05.280 --> 50:09.160
 They're made fun of in that recent Netflix series The Chair.

50:09.160 --> 50:12.440
 And it is easy to make fun of academic life.

50:12.440 --> 50:14.760
 Tom Sharp's Porterhouse Blue did it.

50:14.760 --> 50:18.880
 It's an inherently comical subject.

50:18.880 --> 50:23.360
 Professors at least used to be amusingly eccentric.

50:23.360 --> 50:27.040
 But we've sort of killed off that side of academia

50:27.040 --> 50:31.840
 by turning it into an increasingly doctrinaire

50:31.840 --> 50:35.800
 place where eccentricity is not tolerated.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.160
 I'll give you an illustration of this.

50:37.160 --> 50:41.880
 I had a call this morning from a British academic who said,

50:41.880 --> 50:44.080
 can you give me some advice because they're

50:44.080 --> 50:48.640
 trying to decolonize the curriculum?

50:48.640 --> 50:51.880
 This is coming from the diversity, equity,

50:51.880 --> 50:53.640
 and inclusion officers.

50:53.640 --> 50:55.920
 And it seems to me that what they're

50:55.920 --> 50:58.520
 requiring of us is a fundamental violation

50:58.520 --> 51:02.720
 of academic freedom because it is determining ex ante

51:02.720 --> 51:05.480
 what we should study and teach.

51:05.480 --> 51:07.000
 That's what's going on.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.480
 And that's the thing that we really, really have to resist

51:11.480 --> 51:12.960
 because that kills the university.

51:12.960 --> 51:16.320
 That's the moment that it stops being

51:16.320 --> 51:20.160
 the magical place of intellectual creativity

51:20.160 --> 51:23.960
 and simply becomes an adjunct of the Ministry of Propaganda.

51:23.960 --> 51:27.200
 I've loved the time we spent talking about this

51:27.200 --> 51:29.480
 because it's such a hopeful message for the future

51:29.480 --> 51:35.120
 of the university that I still share with you

51:35.120 --> 51:37.800
 the love of the ideal of the university.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.360
 So a very practical question.

51:39.360 --> 51:43.000
 You mentioned summer.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.560
 Which summer are we talking about?

51:44.560 --> 51:48.320
 So I know we don't want to put hard dates here,

51:48.320 --> 51:51.880
 but what year are we thinking about when is this thing

51:51.880 --> 51:52.520
 launching?

51:52.520 --> 51:53.720
 What are your thoughts on this?

51:53.720 --> 51:57.520
 We are moving as fast as our resources allow.

51:57.520 --> 52:01.760
 The goal is to offer the first of the forbidden courses

52:01.760 --> 52:03.760
 next summer, summer of 2022.

52:03.760 --> 52:09.040
 And we hope to be able to launch an initial, albeit

52:09.040 --> 52:12.200
 relatively small scale masters program

52:12.200 --> 52:14.400
 in the fall of next year.

52:14.400 --> 52:18.280
 That's as fast as is humanly possible.

52:18.280 --> 52:20.960
 So yeah, we're really keen to get going.

52:20.960 --> 52:25.760
 And I think the approach we're taking is somewhat

52:25.760 --> 52:27.040
 imported from Silicon Valley.

52:27.040 --> 52:28.960
 Think of this as a startup.

52:28.960 --> 52:30.280
 Don't think of this as something that

52:30.280 --> 52:33.720
 has to exist as a full service university on day one.

52:33.720 --> 52:35.120
 We don't have the resources for that.

52:35.120 --> 52:36.720
 You did billions and billions of dollars

52:36.720 --> 52:40.000
 to build a university sort of as a facsimile

52:40.000 --> 52:42.200
 of an existing university, but that's not what we want to do.

52:42.200 --> 52:45.600
 I mean, copying and pasting Harvard or Yale or Stanford

52:45.600 --> 52:46.800
 would be a futile thing to do.

52:46.800 --> 52:48.880
 They would probably, you very quickly

52:48.880 --> 52:50.360
 end up with the same pathologies.

52:50.360 --> 52:52.200
 So we do have to come up with a different design.

52:52.200 --> 52:54.640
 And one way of doing that is to grow it organically

52:54.640 --> 52:56.800
 from something quite small.

52:56.800 --> 53:02.040
 Elon Musk mentioned in his usual humorous way on Twitter

53:02.040 --> 53:06.200
 that he wants to launch the Texas Institute of Technology

53:06.200 --> 53:09.360
 in Science, TITS.

53:09.360 --> 53:12.520
 Some people thought this was sexist because of the acronym

53:12.520 --> 53:13.880
 TITS.

53:13.880 --> 53:16.520
 So first of all, I understand their viewpoint,

53:16.520 --> 53:19.200
 but I also think there needs to be a place for humor

53:19.200 --> 53:21.560
 on the internet, even from CEOs.

53:21.560 --> 53:23.800
 So on this podcast, I've gotten a chance

53:23.800 --> 53:26.920
 to talk to quite a few CEOs and what

53:26.920 --> 53:29.600
 I love to see is authenticity.

53:29.600 --> 53:33.120
 And humor is often a sign of authenticity.

53:33.120 --> 53:36.920
 The quirkiness that you mentioned

53:36.920 --> 53:39.560
 is such a beautiful characteristic

53:39.560 --> 53:42.600
 of professors and faculty in great universities

53:42.600 --> 53:46.320
 is also beautiful to see as CEOs, especially founding CEOs.

53:46.320 --> 53:51.520
 So anyway, the deeper point he was making

53:51.520 --> 53:54.400
 is showing an excitement for the university

53:54.400 --> 53:59.040
 as a place for big ideas in science, technology,

53:59.040 --> 53:59.640
 engineering.

53:59.640 --> 54:03.000
 So to me, if there's some kind of way,

54:03.000 --> 54:07.560
 if there is a serious thought that he had behind this tweet,

54:07.560 --> 54:10.960
 not to analyze Elon Musk's Twitter like it's Shakespeare,

54:10.960 --> 54:14.000
 but if there's a serious thought,

54:14.000 --> 54:17.760
 I would love to see him supporting the flourishing

54:17.760 --> 54:20.360
 of Austin as a place for science, technology,

54:20.360 --> 54:22.280
 for these kinds of intellectual developments

54:22.280 --> 54:29.680
 that we're talking about, make a place for free inquiry,

54:29.680 --> 54:34.960
 civil disagreements coupled with great education

54:34.960 --> 54:37.040
 and conversations about artificial intelligence,

54:37.040 --> 54:39.240
 about technology, about engineering.

54:39.240 --> 54:42.280
 So I'm actually going to, I hope there's

54:42.280 --> 54:43.800
 a serious idea behind that tweet.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.240
 I mean, I'm going to chat with him about it.

54:46.240 --> 54:47.360
 I do, too.

54:47.360 --> 54:56.360
 Most of the biggest storms and teacups of my academic career

54:56.360 --> 55:00.800
 have been caused by bad jokes that I've made.

55:00.800 --> 55:04.120
 These days, if you want to make bad jokes,

55:04.120 --> 55:08.000
 being a billionaire is a great idea.

55:08.000 --> 55:12.360
 I'm not here to defend Elon's Twitter style

55:12.360 --> 55:14.320
 or sense of humor.

55:14.320 --> 55:18.280
 He's not going to be remembered for his tweets, I think.

55:18.280 --> 55:21.440
 He's going to be remembered for the astonishing companies

55:21.440 --> 55:24.520
 that he's built and his contributions

55:24.520 --> 55:30.920
 in a whole range of fields from SpaceX to Tesla

55:30.920 --> 55:32.000
 and solar energy.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.720
 And I very much hope that we can interest Elon

55:35.720 --> 55:36.400
 in this project.

55:36.400 --> 55:41.920
 We need not only Elon, but a whole range of his peers

55:41.920 --> 55:45.440
 because this takes resources.

55:45.440 --> 55:47.680
 Universities are not cheap things to run,

55:47.680 --> 55:50.360
 especially if, as I hope, we can make

55:50.360 --> 55:57.880
 as much of the tuition covered by scholarships and bursaries.

55:57.880 --> 56:02.560
 We want to attract the best intellectual talent

56:02.560 --> 56:04.760
 to this institution.

56:04.760 --> 56:07.880
 The best intellectual talent is somewhat randomly distributed

56:07.880 --> 56:08.720
 through society.

56:08.720 --> 56:10.320
 And some of it is in the bottom quintile

56:10.320 --> 56:12.040
 of the income distribution.

56:12.040 --> 56:14.160
 And that makes it hard to get to elite education.

56:14.160 --> 56:17.480
 So this will take resources.

56:17.480 --> 56:22.600
 The last generation of super wealthy plutocrats,

56:22.600 --> 56:26.240
 the generation of the Gilded Age of the late 19th century,

56:26.240 --> 56:29.040
 did a pretty good job of founding universities.

56:29.040 --> 56:33.400
 Chicago wouldn't exist, but for the money of that era.

56:33.400 --> 56:35.760
 And so my message to not only to Elon,

56:35.760 --> 56:38.840
 but to all of the peers, all of those people

56:38.840 --> 56:41.560
 who made their billions out of technology

56:41.560 --> 56:44.720
 over the last couple of decades is, this is your time.

56:44.720 --> 56:47.480
 And this is your opportunity to create something new.

56:47.480 --> 56:51.480
 I can't really understand why the wealthy of our time

56:51.480 --> 56:54.040
 are content to hand their money.

56:54.040 --> 56:57.400
 I mean, think of the vast sums Mike Bloomberg recently

56:57.400 --> 57:01.960
 gave to Johns Hopkins, to his established institutions.

57:01.960 --> 57:06.040
 When, on close inspection, those institutions

57:06.040 --> 57:10.520
 don't seem to spend the money terribly well.

57:10.520 --> 57:13.240
 And in fact, one of the mysteries of our time

57:13.240 --> 57:17.040
 is the lack of due diligence that hardnosed billionaires seem

57:17.040 --> 57:19.600
 to do when it comes to philanthropy.

57:19.600 --> 57:22.080
 So I think there's an opportunity here

57:22.080 --> 57:25.520
 for this generation of very talented wealthy people

57:25.520 --> 57:29.320
 to do what their counterparts did in the late 19th

57:29.320 --> 57:32.920
 and the early 20th century and create some new institutions.

57:32.920 --> 57:35.200
 And they don't need to put their names on the buildings.

57:35.200 --> 57:40.360
 They just need to do what the founders of University of Chicago

57:40.360 --> 57:45.720
 did, create something new that will endure.

57:45.720 --> 57:49.520
 Yeah, MIT is launching a College of Computing.

57:49.520 --> 57:54.640
 And Stephen Schwarzman has given quite a large sum of money,

57:54.640 --> 57:57.160
 I think, in total, $1 billion.

57:57.160 --> 57:59.640
 And as somebody who loves computing,

57:59.640 --> 58:03.840
 as somebody who loves MIT, I want some accountability.

58:03.840 --> 58:07.360
 For MIT becoming a better institution.

58:07.360 --> 58:10.440
 And this is, once again, why I'm excited about University

58:10.440 --> 58:12.560
 of Austin because it serves as a beacon.

58:12.560 --> 58:14.720
 Look, you can create something new.

58:14.720 --> 58:17.240
 And this is what the great institutions of the future

58:17.240 --> 58:18.600
 should look like.

58:18.600 --> 58:22.680
 And Steve Schwarzman is also an innovator.

58:22.680 --> 58:27.160
 The idea of creating a college on the Tsinghua campus

58:27.160 --> 58:29.640
 and creating a kind of Rhodes program for students

58:29.640 --> 58:33.680
 from the Western world to come study in China was Steve's idea.

58:33.680 --> 58:37.000
 And I was somewhat involved, did some visiting,

58:37.000 --> 58:38.880
 professing there.

58:38.880 --> 58:42.760
 It taught me that you can create something new

58:42.760 --> 58:45.400
 in that area of graduate education

58:45.400 --> 58:50.040
 and quite quickly attract really strong applicants.

58:50.040 --> 58:53.120
 Because the people who finished their four years at Harvard

58:53.120 --> 58:57.880
 or Stanford know that they don't know a lot.

58:57.880 --> 59:02.640
 And I, having taught a lot of people in that group,

59:02.640 --> 59:06.280
 know how intellectually dissatisfied they often

59:06.280 --> 59:08.280
 are at the end of four years.

59:08.280 --> 59:09.760
 I mean, they may have beautifully

59:09.760 --> 59:12.760
 gamed the system to graduate summa magna cum laude,

59:12.760 --> 59:17.080
 but they kind of know they'll confess it after a drink or two.

59:17.080 --> 59:18.600
 They know that they gamed the system

59:18.600 --> 59:22.040
 and that intellectually it wasn't the fulfilling experience

59:22.040 --> 59:22.600
 they wanted.

59:22.600 --> 59:26.560
 And they also know that an MBA from a comparable institution

59:26.560 --> 59:29.600
 would not be a massive intellectual step forward.

59:29.600 --> 59:33.840
 So I think what we want to say is here's something really

59:33.840 --> 59:38.120
 novel, exciting, that will be intellectually very challenging.

59:38.120 --> 59:42.600
 I do think the University of Austin has to be difficult.

59:42.600 --> 59:45.440
 I'd like it to feel a little bit like surviving Navy SEAL

59:45.440 --> 59:47.240
 training to come through this program,

59:47.240 --> 59:49.640
 because it will be intellectually demanding.

59:49.640 --> 59:51.560
 And that, I think, should be a magnet.

59:51.560 --> 59:54.480
 So yeah, Steve, if you're listening,

59:54.480 --> 59:57.080
 please join Elon in supporting this.

59:57.080 --> 1:00:00.000
 And Peter, Teal, if you're listening,

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.840
 I know how skeptical you are about the idea of creating

1:00:02.840 --> 1:00:04.920
 a new university, because heaven knows.

1:00:04.920 --> 1:00:06.800
 Peter and I have been discussing this idea for years,

1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:08.680
 and he's always said, well, no, we thought about this,

1:00:08.680 --> 1:00:10.080
 and it just isn't going to work.

1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:15.400
 But I really think we've got a responsibility to do this.

1:00:15.400 --> 1:00:17.280
 Well, Steve's been on the podcast before.

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:20.120
 We've spoken a few times, so I'll send this to him.

1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:22.600
 I hope he does actually get behind it as well.

1:00:22.600 --> 1:00:26.720
 So I'm super excited by the ideas that we've

1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:29.880
 been talking about that this effort represents

1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:33.120
 and what ripple effect it has on the rest of society.

1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:33.960
 So thank you.

1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:36.760
 That was a time beautifully spent.

1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:41.760
 And I'm really grateful for the fortune

1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:45.680
 of getting a chance to talk to you at this moment in history,

1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:48.280
 because I've been a big fan of your work,

1:00:48.280 --> 1:00:50.800
 and the reason I wanted to talk to you today

1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:54.000
 is about all the excellent books you've

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.160
 written about various aspects of history

1:00:56.160 --> 1:01:00.920
 through money, war, power, pandemics, all of that.

1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:03.920
 But I'm glad that we've got a chance

1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:06.600
 to talk about this, which is not looking at history.

1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:08.280
 It's looking at the future.

1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:12.760
 This is a beautiful little fortuitous moment.

1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:15.640
 I appreciate you talking about it.

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:19.960
 In the book, Ascent of Money, you give a history of the world

1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:21.920
 through the lens of money.

1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:25.160
 If the financial system is evolutionary nature,

1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:30.800
 much like life on Earth, what is the origin of money on Earth?

1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:35.480
 The origin of money predates coins.

1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:37.800
 Most people kind of assume I'll talk about coins,

1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:42.080
 but coins are relatively late developments.

1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:44.640
 Back in ancient Mesopotamia, so I don't know,

1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:49.880
 5,000 years ago, there were relations

1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:51.400
 between creditors and debtors.

1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:55.920
 There are even in the simplest economy because of the way

1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:57.960
 in which agriculture works.

1:01:57.960 --> 1:02:00.920
 Hey, I need to plant these seeds,

1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:03.560
 but I'm not going to have crops for X months.

1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:08.280
 So we have clay tablets in which simple debt transactions

1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:09.520
 are inscribed.

1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:12.040
 I remember looking at great numbers of these in the British

1:02:12.040 --> 1:02:14.960
 Museum when I was writing The Ascent of Money.

1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:18.080
 And that's really the beginning of money.

1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:20.920
 The minute you start recording a relationship

1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:22.960
 between a creditor and a debtor, you have something

1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:24.720
 that is quasi money.

1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:29.400
 And that is probably what these clay tablets mostly

1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:31.600
 denoted.

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:35.880
 From that point on, there's a great evolutionary experiment

1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:38.560
 to see what the most convenient way

1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:45.920
 is to record relations between creditors and debtors.

1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:53.280
 And what emerges in the time of the ancient Greeks

1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:59.360
 are coins, metal, tokens, sometimes a valuable metal,

1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:02.880
 sometimes not, usually bearing the imprint of a state

1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:04.440
 or a monarch.

1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:08.200
 And that's the sort of more familiar form of money

1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:12.520
 that we still use today for very, very small transactions.

1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:17.120
 I expect coins will all be gone by the time my youngest son

1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:17.800
 is my age.

1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:21.200
 But they're a last remnant of a very, very old way

1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:24.400
 of doing simple transactions.

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:28.000
 By the way, when you say coins, you mean physical coins.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:28.680
 I'm talking about.

1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:30.720
 Because the term coins has been rebranded

1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:31.680
 in the digital space as well.

1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:34.280
 Yeah, not coin based coins, actual coin coins.

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.520
 You know the ones that jangle in your pocket

1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:39.960
 and you don't know quite what to do with once you have some.

1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:46.920
 So that became an incredibly pervasive form of paying

1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:47.400
 for things.

1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:50.680
 Money is just a crystallization of a relationship

1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:52.000
 between a debtor and a creditor.

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:55.120
 And coins are just very fungible.

1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:58.800
 Whereas a clay tablet relates to a specific transaction,

1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:00.320
 coins are generic and fungible.

1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:02.240
 They can be used in any transaction.

1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:04.920
 So that was an important evolutionary advance.

1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:06.360
 If you think of financial history,

1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:08.280
 and this was the point of the Ascent of Money,

1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:12.520
 as an evolutionary story, there are punctuated equilibria.

1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:15.400
 People get by with coins for a long time,

1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:19.080
 despite their defects as a means of payment,

1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:23.120
 such as that they can be debased, they can be clipped.

1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:27.600
 It's very hard to avoid fake or debased money entering

1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:28.720
 the system.

1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:31.800
 But coinage is still kind of the basis of payments

1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:35.040
 all the way through the Roman Empire, out the other end,

1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:36.960
 into the so called dark ages.

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:40.720
 It's still how most things are settled in cash transactions

1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:43.920
 in the early 1300s.

1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:47.800
 You don't get a big shift until after the Black Death,

1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:50.920
 when there is such a need to monetize the economy

1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:52.440
 because of chronic labor shortages

1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:55.920
 and feudalism begins to unravel, that you just don't

1:04:55.920 --> 1:04:58.880
 have a sufficient amount of coinage.

1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:00.280
 And so you get bills of exchange.

1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:04.640
 And I'm really into bills of exchange because,

1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:07.920
 and this I hope will capture your listeners

1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:10.800
 and viewers imaginations, when they

1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:15.480
 start using bills of exchange, which are really just pieces

1:05:15.480 --> 1:05:19.320
 of paper saying, I owe you over a three month period,

1:05:19.320 --> 1:05:23.920
 while goods are in transit from Florence to London,

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:28.160
 you get the first peer to peer payment system, which

1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:29.600
 is network verified.

1:05:29.600 --> 1:05:31.280
 Because they're not coins.

1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:33.480
 They don't have a king's head on them.

1:05:33.480 --> 1:05:35.280
 They're just pieces of paper.

1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:38.280
 And the verification comes in the form of signatures.

1:05:38.280 --> 1:05:44.000
 And you need, ultimately, some kind of guarantee if I

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.520
 write an IOU to you, bills of exchange,

1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:49.400
 I mean, you don't really know me that well, we only just met.

1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:52.080
 So you might want to get endorsed by, I don't know,

1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:54.920
 somebody really credit worthy like Elon.

1:05:54.920 --> 1:05:58.200
 And so we actually can see in the late 14th century

1:05:58.200 --> 1:06:00.960
 in northern Italy and England and elsewhere,

1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:06.280
 the evolution of a peer to peer network system of payment.

1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:09.240
 And that's actually how world trade grows.

1:06:09.240 --> 1:06:13.400
 Because you just couldn't settle long oceanic transactions

1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:14.040
 with coinage.

1:06:14.040 --> 1:06:15.760
 It just wasn't practical.

1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:18.320
 All those treasure chests full of the balloons,

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:21.080
 which were part of the way in which the Spanish Empire worked

1:06:21.080 --> 1:06:22.680
 were really inefficient.

1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:26.240
 So bills of exchange are an exciting part of the story.

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:29.520
 And they illustrate something I should have made more clear

1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:33.240
 with the ascent of money, that not everything used in payment

1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:36.120
 needs to be money.

1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:39.080
 Classically, economists will tell you, oh, well, money.

1:06:39.080 --> 1:06:41.720
 Money has three different functions.

1:06:41.720 --> 1:06:43.400
 You've heard this a zillion times, right?

1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:45.000
 It's a unit of account.

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.360
 It's a store of value.

1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:49.400
 And it's a medium of exchange.

1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:51.600
 Now, there are three or four things

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:53.000
 that are worth saying about this.

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:53.880
 And I'll just say two.

1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:57.160
 One, it may be that those three things are a trilemma.

1:06:57.160 --> 1:06:59.520
 And it's very difficult for anything to be all of them.

1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:02.600
 This point was made by my Hoover colleague, Manny Rincón,

1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:03.480
 Cruz, last year.

1:07:03.480 --> 1:07:05.720
 And I still wish he would write this up as a paper,

1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:07.720
 because it's a great insight.

1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:09.800
 The second thing that's really interesting to me

1:07:09.800 --> 1:07:12.880
 is that payments don't need to be money.

1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:16.440
 And if we go around, as economists love to do saying,

1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:18.480
 well, Bitcoin's not money, because it doesn't

1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:21.760
 fulfill these criteria, we're missing the point

1:07:21.760 --> 1:07:25.200
 that you could build a system of payments, which I think

1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:28.240
 is how we should think about crypto that isn't money.

1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:29.320
 It doesn't need to be money.

1:07:29.320 --> 1:07:30.640
 It's like bills of exchange.

1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:34.840
 It's network based verification, peer to peer transactions

1:07:34.840 --> 1:07:38.040
 without third party verification.

1:07:38.040 --> 1:07:39.960
 When it hit me the other day that we actually

1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:43.600
 had this precedent for crypto, I got quite excited and thought,

1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:46.600
 I wish I had written that in the assent of money.

1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:49.240
 Can you sort of form a first principles, like almost

1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:54.160
 like a physics perspective, or maybe a human perspective,

1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:58.760
 describe where does the value of money come from?

1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:00.840
 Like, where is it actually?

1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:01.520
 Where is it?

1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:04.720
 So it's a sheet of paper, or it's coins.

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:08.080
 But it feels like in a platonic sense,

1:08:08.080 --> 1:08:11.160
 there's some kind of thing that's actually storing the value,

1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:15.240
 as a bunch of ants are dancing around and so on.

1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:17.320
 I come from a family of physicists.

1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:18.600
 I'm the black sheep of the family.

1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:19.720
 My mother's a physicist.

1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:21.880
 My sister is.

1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:24.560
 So when you ask me to explain something in physics terms,

1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:27.360
 I get a kind of little part of me dies,

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:30.360
 because I know I'll fail.

1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:33.000
 But in truth, it doesn't really matter

1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.440
 what we decide money is going to be.

1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:42.360
 And anything can record, crystallize the relationship

1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:46.040
 between the creditor and the debtor.

1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:47.080
 It can be a piece of paper.

1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:48.400
 It can be a piece of metal.

1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:49.360
 It can be nothing.

1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:51.760
 It can be a digital entry.

1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:56.440
 It's trust that we're really talking about here.

1:08:56.440 --> 1:08:59.680
 We are not just trusting one another.

1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:03.800
 We may not, but we are trusting the money.

1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:09.280
 So whatever we use to represent the creditor

1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:11.520
 debtor relationship, whether it's a banknote or a coin

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:16.360
 or whatever, it does depend on us both trusting it.

1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:21.640
 And that doesn't always pertain.

1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:25.080
 What we see in episodes of inflation,

1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:26.880
 especially episodes of hyperinflation,

1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:29.920
 is a crisis of trust, a crisis of confidence

1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:33.000
 in the means of payment.

1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:34.960
 And this is very traumatic for the societies

1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:38.080
 to which it happens.

1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:40.560
 By and large, human beings, particularly

1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:44.120
 once you have a rule of law system of the sort that evolved

1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:46.520
 in the West and then became generalized,

1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:49.600
 are predisposed to trust one another.

1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:52.560
 And the default setting is to trust money.

1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:54.960
 Even when it depreciates, a quite steady rate

1:09:54.960 --> 1:10:00.040
 as the US dollar has done pretty much uninterruptedly

1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:05.760
 since the 1960s, it takes quite a big disruption for money

1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:07.440
 to lose that trust.

1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:11.680
 But I think essentially what money should be thought of as

1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:15.800
 is a series of tokens that can take any form we like

1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:19.120
 and can be purely digital, which represent

1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:23.240
 our transactions as creditors and debtors.

1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:27.680
 And the whole thing depends on our collective trust to work.

1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:29.920
 I had to explain this to Stephen Colbert once

1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:33.600
 in the Colbert show, the old show that was actually funny.

1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:40.480
 And it was a great moment when he said, so Neil,

1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:41.920
 could I be money?

1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:48.200
 And I said, yes, we could settle a debt with the human being.

1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:50.680
 That was quite common in much of history,

1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:55.160
 but it's not the most convenient form of money.

1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:57.080
 Money has to be convenient.

1:10:57.080 --> 1:11:00.000
 That's why when they worked out how to make payments

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.880
 with cell phones, the Chinese simply went straight there

1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:04.760
 from bank accounts.

1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:06.240
 They skipped out credit cards.

1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:08.240
 You won't see credit cards in China,

1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:10.880
 except in the hands of naive tourists.

1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:16.080
 How much can this trust bear in terms of us humans

1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:18.960
 with our human nature testing it?

1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:22.080
 I guess the surprising thing is the thing works.

1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:26.120
 A bunch of self interested ants running around trading

1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:27.480
 in trust.

1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:31.320
 And it seems to work except for a bunch of moments

1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:33.240
 in human history when there's hyperinflation,

1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:34.480
 like you mentioned.

1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:38.600
 And it's just kind of amazing.

1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:40.560
 It's kind of amazing that us humans,

1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:44.240
 if I were to be optimistic and hopeful about human nature,

1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:49.320
 it gives me a sense that people want to lean on each other.

1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:51.320
 They want to trust.

1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:54.920
 That certainly, I would say probably now,

1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:59.800
 a widely shared view amongst evolutionary psychologists,

1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:01.040
 network scientists.

1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:03.920
 It's one of Nicholas Christakis's argument

1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:05.880
 in a recent book.

1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:09.040
 And I think economic history broadly bears this out.

1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:13.160
 But you have to be cautious.

1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:18.600
 The cases where the system works are familiar to us.

1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:23.880
 Because those are the states and the eras that

1:12:23.880 --> 1:12:26.480
 produce a lot of written records.

1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:30.320
 But when the system of trust collapses

1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:32.520
 and the monetary system collapses with it,

1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:35.080
 there is generally quite a paucity of records.

1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:38.280
 I found that when I was writing Doom.

1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:41.240
 And so we slightly are biased in favor

1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:44.480
 of the periods when trust prevailed

1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:47.120
 and the system functioned.

1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:50.880
 It's very easy to point to a great many episodes

1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:53.560
 of very, very intense monetary chaos,

1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:56.040
 even in the relatively recent past.

1:12:56.040 --> 1:12:58.840
 In the wake of the First World War,

1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:01.320
 multiple currencies, not just the German currency,

1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:03.600
 multiple currencies were completely destroyed,

1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:05.960
 the Russian currency, the Polish currency.

1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:09.640
 There were currency disasters all over central and eastern

1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:12.560
 Europe in the early 1920s.

1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:16.520
 And that was partly because over the course

1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:20.360
 of the 19th century, a system had evolved in which trust

1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:25.600
 was based on gold and rules that were supposedly applied

1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:28.000
 by central banks.

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:32.240
 That system, which produced relative price stability

1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:35.280
 over the 19th century, fell apart

1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:36.760
 as a result of the First World War.

1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:40.240
 And as soon as it was gone, as soon as there was no longer

1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:44.960
 a clear link between those banknotes and coins and gold,

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:47.280
 the whole thing went completely haywire.

1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:50.040
 And I think we should remember that the extent

1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:54.240
 of the monetary chaos from certainly 1918

1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:56.520
 all the way through to the late 1940s.

1:13:56.520 --> 1:13:58.440
 I mean, the German currency was destroyed not once,

1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:00.120
 but twice in that period.

1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:04.040
 And that was one of the most advanced economies in the world.

1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:07.200
 In the United States, there were periods

1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:10.640
 of intensely deep deflation.

1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:13.960
 Prices fell by a third in the Great Depression,

1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:16.960
 and then very serious price volatility in the immediate

1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:18.280
 post World War II period.

1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:21.040
 So it's a bit of an illusion.

1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:23.960
 Maybe it's an illusion for people

1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:27.600
 who've spent most of their lives in the last 20 years.

1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:31.280
 We've had a period of exceptional price stability

1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:36.280
 since this century began in which a regime

1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:39.720
 of central bank independence and inflation targeting

1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:44.280
 appeared to generate steady below 2% inflation

1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:45.600
 in much of the developed world.

1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:48.440
 It was a bit too low for the central bankers liking.

1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:51.080
 And that became a problem in the financial crisis.

1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:54.960
 But we've avoided major price instability

1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:57.560
 for the better part of 20 years in most of the world.

1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:00.680
 There haven't really been that many very high inflation

1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:02.840
 episodes and hardly any hyperinflationary episodes.

1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:05.920
 Venezuela's one of the very few Zimbabwe's another.

1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:08.480
 But if you take a 100 year view or a 200 year view

1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:10.600
 or if you want to take a 500 year view,

1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:14.680
 you realize that quite often the system doesn't work.

1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:16.640
 If you go back to the 17th century,

1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:19.640
 there were multiple competing systems of coinage.

1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:20.960
 There had been a great inflation

1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:24.000
 that had begun the previous century.

1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:25.560
 The price revolution caused mainly

1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:29.000
 by the arrival of New World Silver.

1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.840
 I think financial history is a bit messier

1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:33.800
 than one might think.

1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:36.560
 And the more one studies it,

1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:39.360
 the more one realizes the need for the evolution.

1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:42.000
 The reason bills of exchange came along

1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.040
 was because the coinage systems had stopped working.

1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:47.920
 The reason that banknotes started to become used more

1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:51.000
 generally first in the American colonialism 17th century,

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.360
 then more widely in the 18th century

1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:54.480
 was just that they were more convenient

1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:57.360
 than any other way of paying for things.

1:15:57.360 --> 1:16:00.520
 We had to invent the bond market in the 18th century

1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:02.240
 to cope with the problem of public debt,

1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:03.520
 which up until that point

1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:06.920
 had been a recurrent source of instability.

1:16:06.920 --> 1:16:10.040
 And then we invented equity finance

1:16:10.040 --> 1:16:12.880
 because bonds were not enough.

1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:16.440
 So I would prefer to think of the financial history

1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:18.080
 as a series of crises really

1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:20.800
 that are resolved by innovations.

1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:22.680
 And in the most recent episode,

1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:25.120
 very exciting episode of financial history,

1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:28.640
 something called Bitcoin initiated a new

1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:30.680
 financial or monetary revolution

1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:34.200
 in response, I think, to the growing crisis

1:16:34.200 --> 1:16:36.120
 of the fiat money system.

1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:37.680
 Can you speak to that?

1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:41.720
 So what do you think about Bitcoin?

1:16:41.720 --> 1:16:43.520
 What do you think it is a response to?

1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:46.440
 What are the growing problems of the fiat system?

1:16:46.440 --> 1:16:49.440
 What is this moment in human history

1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:51.360
 that is full of challenges

1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:55.240
 that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies trying to overcome?

1:16:55.240 --> 1:17:00.800
 I don't think Bitcoin was devised by Satoshi,

1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:06.200
 whoever he was, for fear of a breakdown

1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:08.480
 of the fiat currencies.

1:17:08.480 --> 1:17:11.200
 If it was, it was a very farsighted enterprise

1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:12.600
 because certainly in 2008,

1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:14.320
 when the first Bitcoin paper appeared,

1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:17.640
 it wasn't very likely that a wave of inflation

1:17:17.640 --> 1:17:19.320
 was coming, if anything.

1:17:19.320 --> 1:17:22.280
 There was more reason to fear deflation at that point.

1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:26.400
 I think it would be more accurate to say

1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:28.840
 that with the advent of the internet,

1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:31.200
 there was a need for a means of payment

1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:33.280
 native to the internet,

1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:36.280
 typing your credit card number into a random website.

1:17:36.280 --> 1:17:40.280
 It's not the way to pay for things on the internet.

1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:43.600
 And I'd rather think of Bitcoin as the first iteration,

1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:45.200
 the first attempt to solve the problem

1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:46.360
 of how do we pay for things

1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:48.840
 in what we must learn to call the metaverse,

1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:52.520
 but let's just call it the internet for all time's sake.

1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:56.080
 And ever since that initial innovation,

1:17:56.080 --> 1:17:58.600
 the realization that you could use computing power

1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:01.760
 and cryptography to create peer to peer payments

1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:04.200
 without third party verification,

1:18:04.200 --> 1:18:07.200
 a revolution has been gathering momentum

1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:08.960
 that poses a very profound threat

1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:13.200
 to the existing legacy system of banks and fiat currencies.

1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:15.640
 Most money in the world today is made by banks,

1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:17.760
 not central banks, banks.

1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:21.840
 That's what most money is, it's entries in bank accounts.

1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:24.840
 And what Bitcoin represents

1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:27.040
 is an alternative mode of payment

1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:30.280
 that really ought to render banks obsolete.

1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:35.240
 I think this financial revolution has got past

1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:37.440
 the point at which it can be killed.

1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:39.720
 It was vulnerable in the early years,

1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:42.360
 but it now has sufficient adoption

1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:45.440
 and has generated sufficient additional layers.

1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:48.840
 I mean, Ethereum was in many ways the more important innovation

1:18:48.840 --> 1:18:52.240
 because you can build a whole system of payments

1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:54.960
 and ultimately smart contracts on top of Ether.

1:18:54.960 --> 1:18:56.240
 I think we've now reached the point

1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:59.760
 that it's pretty hard to imagine it all being killed.

1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:01.600
 And it's just survived an amazing thing,

1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:03.600
 which was the Chinese shutting down mining

1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:04.520
 and shutting down everything.

1:19:04.520 --> 1:19:09.160
 And still here we are, in fact, cryptos thriving.

1:19:10.240 --> 1:19:14.040
 What we don't know is how much damage

1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:16.840
 ill judged regulatory interventions

1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:19.760
 are going to do to this financial revolution.

1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:21.400
 Left to its own devices,

1:19:21.400 --> 1:19:24.880
 I think decentralized finance provides

1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:28.920
 the native monitoring financial system for the internet.

1:19:29.800 --> 1:19:33.080
 And the more time we spend in the metaverse,

1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:35.160
 the more use we will make of it.

1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:36.720
 The next things that will happen,

1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:40.240
 I think will be that tokens in game spaces

1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:42.080
 like Roblox will become fungible.

1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:45.520
 As my nine year old spends a lot more time

1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:48.240
 playing on computer games than I ever did,

1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:51.760
 I can see that entertainment is becoming

1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:53.040
 a game driven phenomenon.

1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:57.160
 And in the game space, you need skins for your avatar.

1:19:57.160 --> 1:20:01.600
 The economics of the internet, it's evolving very fast.

1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:02.600
 And in parallel,

1:20:02.600 --> 1:20:05.480
 you can see this payments revolution happening.

1:20:05.480 --> 1:20:09.280
 I think that all goes naturally very well

1:20:09.280 --> 1:20:11.280
 and generates an enormous amount

1:20:11.280 --> 1:20:13.600
 of wealth in the process.

1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:17.720
 The problem is there are people in Washington

1:20:17.720 --> 1:20:20.560
 with an overwhelming urge to intervene

1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:24.640
 and disrupt this evolutionary process.

1:20:25.840 --> 1:20:28.880
 Partly, I think out of a muddled sense

1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:32.240
 that there must be a lot of nefarious things going on.

1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:34.880
 If we don't step in, many more will go on.

1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:36.480
 This, I think greatly exaggerates

1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:40.240
 how much criminal activity is in fact going on in the space.

1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:43.120
 But there's also the vested interests at work.

1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:46.560
 It was odd to me, maybe not odd,

1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:47.680
 perhaps it wasn't surprising

1:20:47.680 --> 1:20:50.160
 that the Bank for International Settlements earlier this year

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:53.680
 published a report, one chapter of which said,

1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:56.240
 this must all go, must all stop.

1:20:56.240 --> 1:20:58.120
 It's all got to be shut down

1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:01.520
 and it's got to be replaced by central bank digital currency.

1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:03.400
 And Martin Wolf in the Financial Times read this

1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:04.920
 and said, I agree with this.

1:21:04.920 --> 1:21:07.840
 And once only realized that the banks are clever.

1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:11.240
 They had achieved the intellectual counterattack

1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:15.320
 with almost no fingerprints on the weapon.

1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:19.480
 I think central bank digital currency is a terrible idea.

1:21:19.480 --> 1:21:23.120
 I can't imagine why we would want to copy a Chinese model

1:21:23.120 --> 1:21:25.720
 that essentially takes all transactions

1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:27.480
 and puts them directly under the surveillance

1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:28.800
 of a central government institution.

1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:33.800
 But that suddenly is a serious counter proposal.

1:21:33.800 --> 1:21:38.800
 So on the one side, we have a relatively decentralized,

1:21:38.800 --> 1:21:43.800
 technologically innovative, internet native system

1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:46.480
 of payments that has the possibility to evolve,

1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:50.680
 to produce a full set of smart contracts,

1:21:50.680 --> 1:21:53.520
 reducing enormously the transaction costs

1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:55.680
 that we currently encounter in the financial world

1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:57.480
 because it gets rid of all those middlemen

1:21:57.480 --> 1:22:00.120
 who take their cart every time you take out a mortgage

1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:01.240
 or whatever it is.

1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:04.040
 That's one alternative.

1:22:04.040 --> 1:22:06.920
 But on the other side, we have a highly centralized system

1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:08.920
 in which transactions will by default

1:22:08.920 --> 1:22:11.320
 be under the surveillance of the central bank.

1:22:11.320 --> 1:22:12.880
 Seems like an easy choice to me,

1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:15.440
 but hey, I have this thing about personal liberty.

1:22:16.480 --> 1:22:18.280
 So that's where we are.

1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:23.200
 I don't think that the regulators can kill Web3.

1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:24.560
 I think we're supposed to call it Web3

1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:27.240
 because crypto is now an obsolescent term.

1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:30.360
 They can't kill it, but they can definitely make it difficult.

1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:33.520
 And throw a lot of sand into the machine.

1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:35.200
 And I think worst of all,

1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:37.680
 they can spoil the evolutionary story

1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:40.680
 by creating central bank digital currency

1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:42.960
 that I don't think we really need.

1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:47.480
 Or we certainly don't need it in the Chinese form.

1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:51.720
 So do you think Bitcoin has a strong chance

1:22:51.720 --> 1:22:53.320
 to take over the world?

1:22:53.320 --> 1:22:57.040
 So become the primary.

1:22:57.040 --> 1:23:00.080
 You mentioned the three things that make money money.

1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:02.720
 Become the primary methodology

1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:05.880
 by which we store wealth, we exchange.

1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:07.160
 No.

1:23:07.160 --> 1:23:09.600
 No, I think what Bitcoin is,

1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:13.080
 this was a phrase that I got from my friend Matt McClennan,

1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:15.760
 first eagle, an option on digital gold.

1:23:15.760 --> 1:23:18.520
 So it's the gold of the system,

1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:20.720
 but currently behaves like an option.

1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:22.360
 That's why it's quite volatile.

1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:25.800
 Because we don't really know if this brave new world

1:23:25.800 --> 1:23:29.280
 of crypto is gonna work.

1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:31.200
 But if it does work, then Bitcoin is the gold

1:23:31.200 --> 1:23:33.440
 because of the finite supply.

1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:36.400
 What role we need gold to play

1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:38.880
 in the metaverse isn't quite clear.

1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:41.600
 I love that you're using the term metaverse, this is great.

1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:45.440
 Well, I just like the metaversity as a kind of,

1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:48.400
 as the antithesis of what we're trying to do in Austin.

1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:52.320
 But can you imagine I'm using it sarcastically?

1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:54.480
 I come from Glasgow where all novel words

1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:55.720
 have to be used sarcastically.

1:23:55.720 --> 1:23:57.520
 So the metaverse sarcastically.

1:23:57.520 --> 1:24:00.360
 But see the beauty about humor and sarcasm

1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:03.520
 is that the joke becomes reality.

1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:05.800
 I mean, it's like using the word big bang

1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:07.560
 to describe the origins of the universe.

1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:09.440
 It becomes like that.

1:24:09.440 --> 1:24:10.280
 It will.

1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:11.800
 After a while, it's in the textbooks

1:24:11.800 --> 1:24:13.280
 and nobody's laughing.

1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:14.360
 Well, that's exactly right.

1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:15.360
 So sticky.

1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:17.760
 Yeah.

1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:18.760
 I'm on the side of humor,

1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:21.400
 but it is a dangerous activity these days.

1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:25.360
 Anyway, I think Bitcoin is the option of digital gold.

1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:30.360
 The role it plays is probably not so much story value.

1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:33.800
 Right now, it's just nicely not very correlated asset

1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:35.200
 in your portfolio.

1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:36.800
 When I updated the Ascent of Money,

1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:40.080
 which was in 2018, 10 years after it came out,

1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:42.240
 I wrote a new chapter in which I said,

1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:48.160
 Bitcoin, which had just sold off after its 2017 bubble

1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:51.280
 will rise again through adoption.

1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:55.520
 Because if every millionaire in the world has 0.2%

1:24:55.520 --> 1:24:57.800
 of his or her wealth in Bitcoin,

1:24:57.800 --> 1:24:59.920
 the price should be $15,000.

1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:03.320
 If it's 1%, it's $75,000.

1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:06.040
 And it might not even stay at 1%

1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:08.200
 because, I mean, look at its recent performance.

1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:12.360
 If your exposure to global stocks

1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:16.280
 had been hedged with a significant crypto holding,

1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:19.200
 you would have aced the last few months.

1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:24.120
 So I think the noncorrelation property

1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:27.280
 is very, very important in driving adoption.

1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:29.280
 And the volatility also drives adoption

1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:31.920
 if you're a sophisticated investor.

1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:36.480
 So I think the adoption drives Bitcoin up

1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:38.200
 because it's the option of digital gold.

1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:41.120
 But it's also just this nicely not very correlated asset

1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:42.640
 that you wanna hold.

1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:45.560
 In a world where the hell, I mean,

1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:47.360
 the central bank is gonna tighten.

1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:49.560
 We've come through this massively disruptive episode

1:25:49.560 --> 1:25:52.600
 of the pandemic, public debt soared,

1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:54.520
 money printing soared.

1:25:55.680 --> 1:25:57.560
 You could hang around with your bonds

1:25:57.560 --> 1:26:00.680
 and wait for the euthanasia of the Rontier.

1:26:00.680 --> 1:26:02.680
 You can hang on to your tech stocks

1:26:02.680 --> 1:26:05.600
 and just hope there isn't a massive correction or dot, dot,

1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:06.440
 dot.

1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:08.680
 Well, and it seems like a fairly obvious strategy

1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:11.520
 to make sure that you have at least some crypto

1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:16.600
 for the coming year, given what we likely have to face.

1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:17.920
 I think what's really interesting

1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:20.720
 is that on top of Ethereum,

1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:25.720
 a more elaborate financial system is being built.

1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:32.240
 Stable coins are the interesting puzzle for me

1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000
 because we need off ramps.

1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:39.080
 Ultimately, you and I have to pay taxes in US dollars.

1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:44.040
 And there's no getting away from that.

1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:48.600
 The IRS is gonna let us hold crypto as long as we pay our taxes.

1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:51.000
 And the only question in my mind is,

1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:55.360
 what's the optimal off ramp to make those taxes,

1:26:55.360 --> 1:26:56.720
 make those tax payments?

1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:01.840
 Probably it shouldn't be a currency invented by Facebook.

1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:05.800
 Never struck me as the best solution to this problem.

1:27:05.800 --> 1:27:08.000
 Maybe it's some kind of Fed coin

1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:13.400
 or maybe one of the existing algorithmic stable coins

1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:16.840
 does the job, but we clearly need some stable off ramp.

1:27:16.840 --> 1:27:18.960
 So you don't think it's possible for the IRS

1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:20.800
 within the next decade to be accepting

1:27:20.800 --> 1:27:22.880
 Bitcoin as tax payments?

1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:24.360
 I doubt that.

1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:26.240
 Having dealt with the IRS now,

1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:28.920
 since when did I first come here, 2002?

1:27:30.240 --> 1:27:32.520
 It's hard to think of an institution less likely

1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:37.520
 to leap into the 21st century when it comes to payments.

1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:42.000
 No, I think we'll be tolerated,

1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.680
 the crypto world will be tolerated

1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:46.560
 as long as we pay our taxes.

1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:49.360
 And it's important that we're already at that point.

1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:50.640
 And then the next question becomes,

1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:53.960
 well, does Gary Gensler define everything as a security?

1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:56.280
 And do we then have to go through

1:27:56.280 --> 1:28:00.640
 endless regulatory contortions to satisfy the SEC?

1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:03.760
 There's a whole bunch of uncertainties

1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:06.520
 that the administrative state excels at creating,

1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:09.640
 because that's just how the administrative state works.

1:28:09.640 --> 1:28:11.040
 You're doing something new.

1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:14.000
 Hmm, I'll decide whether that's a security,

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.160
 but don't expect me to define it for you.

1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:17.880
 I'll decide in an arbitrary way,

1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:19.440
 and then you'll owe me money.

1:28:19.440 --> 1:28:21.560
 So all of this is going to be very annoying.

1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:25.640
 And for people who are trying to run exchanges

1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:27.680
 or innovate in the space,

1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:29.680
 these regulations will be annoying.

1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:32.440
 But the problem with fintech is it's different from tech,

1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:34.240
 broadly defined.

1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:37.040
 When tech got into eCommerce with Amazon,

1:28:37.040 --> 1:28:40.440
 when it got into social networking with Facebook,

1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:43.760
 there wasn't a huge regulatory jungle to navigate,

1:28:43.760 --> 1:28:45.760
 but welcome to the world of finance,

1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:48.920
 which has always been a jungle of regulation,

1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:53.040
 because the regulation is there to basically

1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:56.160
 entrench the incumbents, that's what it's for.

1:28:56.160 --> 1:28:59.200
 So it'll be a much tougher fight

1:28:59.200 --> 1:29:03.120
 than the fights we've seen of other aspects

1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:04.880
 of the tech revolution,

1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:09.680
 because the incumbents are there and they see the threat.

1:29:09.680 --> 1:29:13.120
 And in the end, Satoshi said it very explicitly.

1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:14.240
 It's peer to peer payment

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:15.800
 without third party verification.

1:29:15.800 --> 1:29:18.200
 And all the third parties are going, wait, what?

1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:19.480
 What are the third parties?

1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:24.000
 So there is a connection between power and money.

1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:29.160
 You've mentioned World War I from the perspective of money.

1:29:29.160 --> 1:29:34.160
 So power, money, war, authoritarian regimes.

1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:37.360
 From the perspective of money,

1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:42.160
 do you have hope that cryptocurrency can help resist war,

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:46.240
 can help resist the negative effects

1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:50.400
 of authoritarian regimes, or is that a silly hope?

1:29:52.880 --> 1:29:57.680
 Wars happen because the people

1:29:58.840 --> 1:30:03.840
 who have the power to command armed forces miscalculate.

1:30:03.840 --> 1:30:07.400
 Miscalculate, that's generally what happens.

1:30:09.680 --> 1:30:12.120
 And we will have a big war in the near future

1:30:12.120 --> 1:30:14.240
 if both the Chinese government

1:30:14.240 --> 1:30:17.040
 and the US government miscalculates

1:30:17.040 --> 1:30:20.320
 and they unleash lethal force on one another.

1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:23.640
 And there's nothing that any financial institution can do

1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:27.440
 to stop that any more than the Rothschilds

1:30:27.440 --> 1:30:29.360
 could stop World War I.

1:30:29.360 --> 1:30:31.760
 And they were then the biggest bank in the world by far

1:30:31.760 --> 1:30:35.600
 with massive international financial influence.

1:30:35.600 --> 1:30:39.400
 So let's accept that war is in a different domain.

1:30:41.080 --> 1:30:45.080
 War would impact the financial world massively

1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:47.600
 if it were a war between the United States and China

1:30:47.600 --> 1:30:52.360
 because there's still a huge China trade on.

1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:55.920
 Wall Street is long China, Europe is long China.

1:30:56.880 --> 1:30:59.520
 So the conflict that I could foresee in the future

1:30:59.520 --> 1:31:02.920
 is one that's highly financially disruptive.

1:31:02.920 --> 1:31:04.280
 Where does crypto fit in?

1:31:05.320 --> 1:31:09.920
 Crypto's obvious utility in the short run

1:31:09.920 --> 1:31:13.880
 is as a store of wealth, of transferable wealth

1:31:13.880 --> 1:31:17.080
 for people who live in dangerous places

1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:19.560
 with failing, not just failing money,

1:31:19.560 --> 1:31:21.440
 but failing rule of law.

1:31:21.440 --> 1:31:22.760
 That's why in Latin America,

1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:24.440
 there's so much interest in crypto

1:31:24.440 --> 1:31:26.560
 because Latin Americans have a lot of monetary history

1:31:26.560 --> 1:31:29.800
 to look back on and not much of it is good.

1:31:29.800 --> 1:31:34.800
 So I think that the short run problem that crypto solves

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:39.040
 is, and this goes back to the digital gold point,

1:31:39.040 --> 1:31:42.960
 if you are in a dangerous place with weak rule of law

1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:44.640
 and weak property rights,

1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:49.240
 here is a new and better way to have portable wealth.

1:31:51.200 --> 1:31:56.000
 I think the next question to ask is

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:58.800
 would you want to be long crypto

1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:00.840
 in the event of World War III?

1:32:02.040 --> 1:32:03.520
 What's interesting about that question

1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:05.200
 is that World War III would likely have

1:32:05.200 --> 1:32:07.440
 a significant cyber dimension to it.

1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:10.840
 And I don't wanna be 100% in crypto

1:32:10.840 --> 1:32:13.960
 if they crash the internet,

1:32:13.960 --> 1:32:18.400
 which between them China and Russia might be able to do.

1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:19.920
 That's a fascinating question,

1:32:19.920 --> 1:32:22.600
 whether you want to be holding physical gold

1:32:22.600 --> 1:32:25.960
 or digital gold in the event of World War III.

1:32:25.960 --> 1:32:27.800
 The smart person who studied history

1:32:27.800 --> 1:32:30.360
 definitely wants better both.

1:32:30.360 --> 1:32:34.000
 And so let's imagine World War III

1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:36.840
 has a very, very severe cyber component to it

1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:39.240
 with high levels of disruption.

1:32:39.240 --> 1:32:44.040
 Yeah, you'd be glad of the old Chinese stuff at that point.

1:32:44.040 --> 1:32:49.040
 So diversification still seems like the most important truth

1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:52.600
 of financial history.

1:32:52.600 --> 1:32:54.040
 And what is crypto?

1:32:54.040 --> 1:32:57.160
 It's just this wonderful new source of diversification.

1:32:57.160 --> 1:33:00.320
 But you would be nuts to be 100% in Bitcoin.

1:33:00.320 --> 1:33:02.560
 I mean, I have some friends

1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:04.560
 who are probably quite close to that.

1:33:04.560 --> 1:33:05.720
 Close to 100%.

1:33:05.720 --> 1:33:10.320
 I admire the balls of steel.

1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:16.800
 Yeah, in whatever way that balls of steel takes form.

1:33:18.120 --> 1:33:20.080
 You mentioned smart contracts.

1:33:20.080 --> 1:33:21.720
 What are your thoughts about,

1:33:21.720 --> 1:33:23.560
 in the context of the history of money,

1:33:23.560 --> 1:33:25.560
 about Ethereum, about smart contracts,

1:33:25.560 --> 1:33:30.560
 about kind of more systematic at scale formalization

1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:33.360
 of agreements between humans?

1:33:34.800 --> 1:33:39.400
 I think it must be the case

1:33:40.480 --> 1:33:45.480
 that a lot of the complexity in a mortgage is redundant.

1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:51.760
 That when we are confronted with pages and pages

1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:53.800
 and pages and pages of small prints,

1:33:55.320 --> 1:33:58.000
 we're seeing some manifestation

1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:01.120
 of the late stage regulatory state.

1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:03.280
 The transaction itself is quite simple.

1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:08.400
 And most of the verbiage is just ass covering by regulators.

1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:11.320
 So I think the smart contract,

1:34:12.360 --> 1:34:16.000
 although I'm sure lawyers will email me

1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:17.680
 and tell me I'm wrong,

1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:20.360
 can deal with a lot of the plain vanilla

1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:24.080
 and maybe not so plain transactions that we want to do

1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:28.600
 and eliminate yet more intermediaries.

1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:31.960
 That's my kind of working assumption.

1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:36.960
 And given that a lot of financial transactions

1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:41.720
 have the potential at least to be simplified,

1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:45.360
 automated, turned into smart contracts,

1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:48.360
 that's probably where the future goes.

1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:51.880
 I can't see an obvious reason why my range

1:34:51.880 --> 1:34:54.080
 of different financial needs,

1:34:54.080 --> 1:34:56.520
 let's think about insurance for example,

1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:00.920
 will continue to be met with instruments

1:35:00.920 --> 1:35:04.240
 that in some ways are 100 years old.

1:35:05.560 --> 1:35:08.600
 So I think we're still at an early stage

1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:12.400
 of a financial revolution that will greatly streamline

1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:17.080
 how we take care of all those financial needs that we have,

1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:19.840
 mortgages and insurance leap to mind.

1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:23.360
 You know, most households are penalized

1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:27.080
 for being financially poorly educated

1:35:27.080 --> 1:35:29.640
 and confronted with oligopolistic

1:35:29.640 --> 1:35:31.600
 financial services providers.

1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:35.720
 So you kind of leave college already in debt.

1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:40.320
 So you start in debt servitude.

1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:45.240
 And then you gotta somehow lever up to buy a home if you can,

1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:47.480
 because everybody's kind of telling you you should do that.

1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:52.480
 So you and your spouse, you are getting even more leveraged

1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:57.400
 and you're long one asset class called real estate,

1:35:57.400 --> 1:35:59.560
 which is super illiquid.

1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:03.480
 I mean, already I'm crying inside

1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:06.640
 at the thought of describing so many households,

1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:07.960
 financial predicament in that way.

1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:10.640
 And I'm not done with them yet because oh, by the way,

1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:13.160
 there's all this insurance you have to take out.

1:36:13.160 --> 1:36:15.360
 And here are the providers that are willing to insure you

1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:17.720
 and here are the premiums you're gonna be paying,

1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:19.280
 which are kind of presented to you.

1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:22.200
 That's your car insurance, that's your home insurance.

1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:23.800
 And if you're here, it's the earthquake insurance.

1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:26.480
 And pretty soon you're just bleeding money

1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:30.920
 in a bunch of monthly payments to the mortgage lender,

1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:35.600
 to the insurer, to all the other people that lent you money.

1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:38.920
 And let's look at your balance sheet, it sucks.

1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:41.200
 You know, there's this great big chunk of real estate

1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:43.640
 and what else have you really got on there?

1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:45.320
 And the other side is a bunch of debt,

1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:48.320
 which is probably paying too high interest.

1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:52.080
 The typical household in the median kind of range

1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:57.080
 is at the mercy of oligopolistic financial services providers.

1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:01.200
 Go down further in the social scale

1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:03.760
 and people are outside the financial system altogether.

1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:07.520
 And those poor folks have to rely on bank notes

1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:10.920
 and informal lending with huge punitive rates.

1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:12.080
 We have to do better.

1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:15.320
 This has to be improved upon.

1:37:15.320 --> 1:37:17.360
 And I think what's exciting about our time

1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:19.520
 is that technology now exists,

1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:21.720
 that didn't exist when I wrote the Ascent of Money

1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:22.680
 to solve these problems.

1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:25.200
 When I wrote the Ascent of Money, which is in 2008,

1:37:26.360 --> 1:37:30.400
 you couldn't really solve the problem I've just described.

1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:31.600
 Certainly you couldn't solve it

1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:33.000
 with something like microfinance.

1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.760
 That was obviously not viable,

1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:38.080
 the interest rates were high,

1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:40.720
 the transaction costs were crazy.

1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:42.000
 But now we have solutions.

1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:43.960
 And the solutions are extremely exciting.

1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:46.160
 So Fintech is this great force for good

1:37:46.160 --> 1:37:48.800
 that brings people into the financial system

1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:50.880
 and reduces transaction costs.

1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:53.240
 Crypto is part of it, but it's just part of it.

1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:55.880
 There's a much broader story of Fintech going on here

1:37:55.880 --> 1:38:00.640
 where suddenly you get financial services on your phone

1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:03.480
 don't cost nearly as much as they did

1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:05.080
 when there had to be a bricks and mortar building

1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:08.200
 on Main Street that you kind of went humbly

1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:10.400
 and beseeched to lend you money.

1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:11.600
 I'm excited about that

1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:14.720
 because it seems to me very socially transformative.

1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:17.640
 I'll give you one other example of what's great.

1:38:17.640 --> 1:38:20.280
 The people who really get sculpted

1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:22.640
 in our financial system are senders

1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:25.800
 and receivers of remittances,

1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:29.040
 which are often amongst the poorest families in the world,

1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:32.400
 the people who are like my wife's family in East Africa

1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:34.520
 really kind of hand to mouth.

1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:36.440
 And if you send money to East Africa

1:38:36.440 --> 1:38:39.040
 or the Philippines or Central America,

1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:41.840
 it's the transaction costs are awful.

1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:46.080
 I'm talking to you, Western Union.

1:38:48.200 --> 1:38:50.200
 We're gonna solve that problem.

1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:51.200
 So 10 years from now,

1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:53.480
 the transaction costs will just be negligible

1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:55.520
 and the money will go to the people who need it

1:38:55.520 --> 1:38:58.120
 rather than to rent seeking financial institutions.

1:38:58.120 --> 1:38:59.920
 So I'm on the side of the revolution with this

1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:02.680
 because I think the incumbent financial institutions

1:39:02.680 --> 1:39:05.800
 globally are doing a pretty terrible job

1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:10.360
 and middle class and lower class families lose out.

1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:13.920
 And thankfully technology allows us to fix this.

1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:15.120
 Yeah, so fintech can remove

1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:17.120
 a lot of inefficiencies in the system.

1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:18.920
 I'm super excited myself,

1:39:18.920 --> 1:39:22.080
 maybe as a machine learning person in data oracles.

1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:26.480
 So converting a lot of our physical world into data

1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:29.240
 and have smart contracts on top of that.

1:39:29.240 --> 1:39:32.680
 So that no longer is there's this fuzziness

1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:36.640
 about what is the concrete nature of the agreements.

1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:39.840
 You can tie your agreement to weather.

1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:42.760
 You can tie your agreement to the behavior

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:46.280
 of certain kinds of financial systems.

1:39:46.280 --> 1:39:49.720
 You can tie your behavior to, I don't know.

1:39:49.720 --> 1:39:50.720
 I mean, all kinds of things.

1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:52.280
 You can connect it to the body

1:39:52.280 --> 1:39:55.960
 in terms of human sensory information.

1:39:55.960 --> 1:39:58.360
 Like you can make an agreement

1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:03.160
 that if you don't lose five pounds in the next month,

1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:05.600
 you're going to pay me $1,000 or something like that.

1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:06.440
 I don't know.

1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:08.160
 It's a stupid example, but it's not

1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:11.360
 because you can create all kinds of services on top of that.

1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:15.080
 You can just create all kinds of interesting applications

1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:18.760
 that completely revolutionize how humans transact.

1:40:19.720 --> 1:40:24.720
 I think, of course, we don't want to create a world

1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:29.520
 of Chinese style social credit

1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:34.360
 in which our behavior becomes so transparent

1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:36.880
 to providers of financial services,

1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:38.040
 particularly insurers,

1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:42.000
 that when I try to go into the pub,

1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.840
 I'm stopped from doing so.

1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:47.120
 Every time you take a drink, your insurance goes up.

1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:52.600
 Right, or my credit card won't work in certain restaurants

1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:56.080
 because they serve ribeye steak.

1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:59.200
 I fear that world because I see it being built in China.

1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:02.360
 And we must, at all costs,

1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:05.880
 make sure that the Western world has something distinctive

1:41:05.880 --> 1:41:07.480
 to offer.

1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:09.840
 It can't just be, oh, it's the same as in China,

1:41:09.840 --> 1:41:13.560
 only the data go to five tech companies

1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:16.880
 rather than to Xi Jinping.

1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:21.680
 So I think that the way we need to steer this world

1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:26.680
 is in the way that our data

1:41:26.840 --> 1:41:31.080
 are, by default, vaulted on our devices.

1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:35.360
 And we choose when to release the data

1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:37.960
 rather than the default setting

1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:40.040
 being that the data are available.

1:41:40.040 --> 1:41:41.080
 That's important, I think,

1:41:41.080 --> 1:41:43.000
 because it was one of the biggest mistakes

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.400
 of the evolution of the internet

1:41:45.400 --> 1:41:50.040
 that in a way, the default was to let our data be plundered.

1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:53.720
 It's hard to undo that, but I think we can at least

1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:57.800
 create a new regime that, in future,

1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:02.120
 makes privacy default rather than open access default.

1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:07.960
 In the book, Doom, The Politics of Catastrophe,

1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:11.880
 your newest book, you describe wars, pandemics,

1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:14.280
 and the terrible disasters in human history,

1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:17.920
 which stands out to you as the worst

1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:21.080
 in terms of how much it shook the world

1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:22.280
 and the human spirit.

1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:28.760
 I am glad I was not around in the mid 14th century

1:42:29.200 --> 1:42:32.640
 when the bubonic plague swept across Eurasia.

1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:38.360
 As far as we can see, that was history's worst pandemic.

1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:40.360
 Maybe there was a comparably bad one

1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:43.680
 in the reign of the emperor, Justinian,

1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:47.880
 but there's some reason to think it wasn't as bad.

1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:51.520
 And the more we learn about the 14th century,

1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:54.400
 the more we realize that it really was across Eurasia

1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:59.400
 and that the mortality was 30% in some places, 50%

1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:02.600
 in some places higher, there were whole towns

1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:03.760
 that were just emptied.

1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:07.440
 And when one reads about the Black Death,

1:43:07.440 --> 1:43:12.440
 it's an unimaginable nightmare of death

1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:17.440
 and madness in the death with flagellant orders

1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:20.480
 wandering from town to town,

1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:22.800
 seeking to ward off divine retribution

1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:24.880
 by flogging themselves,

1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:27.040
 people turning on the local Jewish communities

1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:28.960
 as if it's somehow their fault.

1:43:28.960 --> 1:43:32.440
 That must have been a nightmarish time.

1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:36.640
 If you asked me for a Nolso ran and runner up,

1:43:36.640 --> 1:43:41.640
 it would be World War II in Eastern Europe.

1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:45.800
 And in many ways, it might have been worse

1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:49.880
 because for a medieval peasant,

1:43:49.880 --> 1:43:53.240
 the sense of being on the wrong side of divine retribution

1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:54.840
 must have been overpowering.

1:43:56.280 --> 1:43:58.880
 In the mid 20th century,

1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:03.680
 you knew that this was manmade murder

1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:06.480
 on a massive industrial scale.

1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:10.080
 If one reads Brosman's Life and Fate,

1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:12.400
 just to take one example,

1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:17.400
 one enters a hellscape that it's extremely hard

1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:21.600
 to imagine oneself in.

1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:25.040
 So these are two of the great disasters of human history.

1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:27.680
 And if we did have a time machine,

1:44:27.680 --> 1:44:31.360
 if one really were able to transport people back

1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:35.040
 and give them a glimpse of these times,

1:44:35.040 --> 1:44:37.680
 I think the post traumatic stress would be enormous.

1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:39.960
 People would come back from those trips,

1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:42.440
 even if it was a one day excursion

1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:46.680
 with guaranteed survival in a state of utter shock.

1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:50.680
 You often explore counterfactual and hypothetical history,

1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:53.280
 which is a fascinating thing to do,

1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:55.480
 sometimes to a controversial degree.

1:44:56.680 --> 1:44:59.280
 And again, you walk through that fire gracefully.

1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:04.840
 So let me ask maybe about World War II

1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:09.840
 or in general, what key moments in history

1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:12.280
 of the 20th century,

1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:15.760
 do you think if something else happened at those moments,

1:45:15.760 --> 1:45:18.160
 we could have avoided some of the big atrocities?

1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:21.080
 Stalin's Hall of More, Hitler's Holocaust,

1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:22.760
 Mao's Great Chinese Famine?

1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:28.520
 The great turning point in world history

1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:33.520
 is August the 2nd, 1914,

1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:38.520
 when the British cabinet decides to intervene

1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:44.640
 and what would have been a European war becomes a world war.

1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:47.360
 And with British intervention,

1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:50.680
 it becomes a massively larger and more protracted conflict.

1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:53.320
 So very early in my career,

1:45:53.320 --> 1:45:56.760
 I became very preoccupied with the deliberations on that day

1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:02.160
 and the surprising decision that a liberal cabinet took

1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:06.520
 to go to war, which you might not have bet on that morning

1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:10.720
 because there seemed to be a majority of cabinet members

1:46:10.720 --> 1:46:13.000
 who would be disinclined and only a minority,

1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:15.280
 including Winston Churchill, who wanted to go to war.

1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:16.800
 So that's one turning point.

1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:20.200
 I often wish I could get my time machine working

1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:22.680
 and go back and say, wait, stop.

1:46:22.680 --> 1:46:24.320
 Just think about what you're going to do.

1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:28.960
 And by the way, let me show you a video of Europe in 1918.

1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:29.800
 So that's one.

1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:32.640
 Can we linger on that one? That one,

1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:37.880
 a lot of people push back on you on in the,

1:46:37.880 --> 1:46:39.360
 because it's so difficult.

1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:43.720
 So the idea is, if I could try to summarize,

1:46:43.720 --> 1:46:46.440
 and you're the first person that made me think

1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:50.400
 about this very uncomfortable thought,

1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:54.360
 which is the ideas in World War I,

1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:57.560
 it would be a better world if Britain stayed out of the war

1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:00.520
 and Germany won.

1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:01.360
 Right.

1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:05.960
 Thinking now, in retrospect,

1:47:05.960 --> 1:47:08.000
 at the whole story of the 20th century,

1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:11.960
 thinking about Stalin's rule of 30 years,

1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:14.560
 thinking about Hitler's rise to power

1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:18.360
 and the atrocities of the Holocaust,

1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:21.360
 but also, like you said, on the Eastern Front,

1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:25.960
 the death of tens of millions of people through the war.

1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:28.600
 And also sort of the political prisoners

1:47:28.600 --> 1:47:30.680
 and the suffering connected to communism,

1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:33.120
 connected to fascism, all those kinds of things.

1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:37.880
 Well, that's one heck of an example

1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:39.480
 of why you're just like fearless

1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:44.120
 in this particular style of exploring counterfactual history.

1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:47.400
 So can you elaborate on that idea

1:47:47.400 --> 1:47:50.200
 and maybe why this was such an important day

1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:52.160
 in human history?

1:47:52.160 --> 1:47:55.440
 This argument was central to my book, The Pity of War.

1:47:55.440 --> 1:47:58.400
 I also did an essay in virtual history about this.

1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:01.200
 And it's always amused me that from around that time,

1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:03.240
 I began to be called a conservative historian

1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:05.560
 because it's actually a very left wing argument.

1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:08.440
 The people in 1914 who thought Britain should stay at the war

1:48:08.440 --> 1:48:10.560
 were the left of the Labour Party,

1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:13.160
 who split to become the independent Labour Party.

1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:16.120
 What would have happened?

1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:16.960
 Well, first of all,

1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:19.960
 Britain was not ready for war in 1914.

1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:21.120
 There had not been conscription.

1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:23.120
 The army was tiny.

1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:25.640
 So Britain had failed to deter Germany.

1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:27.040
 The Germans took the decision

1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:30.000
 that they could risk going through Belgium

1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.560
 using the Schlieffen Plan to fight their two front war.

1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:37.560
 They calculated that Britain's intervention

1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:39.560
 would either not happen or not matter.

1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:46.400
 If Britain had been strategically committed

1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:48.960
 to preventing Germany winning a war in Europe,

1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:51.280
 they should have introduced conscription 10 years before,

1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:53.440
 had a meaningful land army,

1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:55.800
 and that would have deterred the Germans.

1:48:55.800 --> 1:48:59.320
 So the Liberal government provided the worst of both worlds,

1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:03.360
 a commitment that was more or less secret to intervene

1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:05.480
 that the public didn't know about.

1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:07.640
 In fact, much of the Liberal Party didn't know about,

1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:09.560
 but without really the means

1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:11.320
 to make that intervention effective,

1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:13.440
 a tiny army with just a few divisions.

1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:16.080
 So it was perfectly reasonable to argue

1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:19.720
 as a number of people did on August the 2nd, 1914,

1:49:19.720 --> 1:49:21.600
 that Britain should not intervene.

1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:23.560
 After all, Britain had not immediately intervened

1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:27.200
 against the French Revolutionary armies back in the 1790s.

1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:30.520
 It had played an offshore role, ultimately intervening,

1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:32.920
 but not immediately intervening.

1:49:32.920 --> 1:49:35.360
 If Britain had stayed out,

1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:38.480
 I don't think that France would have collapsed immediately

1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:40.440
 as it had in 1870.

1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:42.440
 The French held up remarkably well

1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:44.480
 to catastrophic casualties

1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:47.840
 in the first six months of the First World War.

1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:52.440
 But by 1916, I don't see how France could have kept going

1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:54.880
 if Britain had not joined the war.

1:49:54.880 --> 1:49:56.960
 And I think the war would have been over perhaps

1:49:56.960 --> 1:49:59.240
 at some point in 1916.

1:49:59.240 --> 1:50:00.560
 We know that Germany's aims

1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:02.360
 would have been significantly limited

1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:04.520
 because they would have needed to keep Britain out.

1:50:04.520 --> 1:50:06.200
 If they'd succeeded in keeping Britain out,

1:50:06.200 --> 1:50:07.720
 they'd have had to keep Britain out.

1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:08.760
 And the way to keep Britain out

1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:11.920
 was obviously not to make any annexation of Belgium,

1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:14.120
 to limit German war aims,

1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:16.560
 particularly to limit them to Eastern Europe.

1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:17.640
 And from Britain's point of view,

1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:19.160
 what was not to like?

1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:23.320
 So the Russian Empire is defeated along with France.

1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:27.560
 What does that really change?

1:50:27.560 --> 1:50:29.840
 If the Germans are sensible

1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:33.880
 and we can see what this might have looked like,

1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:35.880
 they focus on Eastern Europe.

1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:38.440
 They take chunks of the Russian Empire,

1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:40.600
 perhaps they create as they did

1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:44.440
 in the piece of Brestletovsk,

1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:47.160
 an independent or quasi independent Poland.

1:50:47.160 --> 1:50:49.400
 In no way does that pose a threat to the British Empire.

1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:52.080
 In fact, it's a good thing.

1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:54.400
 Britain never had had a particularly good relationship

1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:56.120
 with the Russian Empire after all.

1:50:57.240 --> 1:50:59.440
 The key point here is that the Germany

1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:02.280
 that emerges from victory in 1916

1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:05.000
 has a kind of European Union.

1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:09.120
 It's the dominant power of an enlarged Germany

1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:12.920
 with a significant Middle Europa,

1:51:12.920 --> 1:51:13.840
 whatever you want to call it,

1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:18.240
 a customs union type arrangement with neighboring countries,

1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:20.280
 including one suspects Austria Hungary.

1:51:22.160 --> 1:51:27.160
 That is a very different world from the world of 1917, 18.

1:51:27.440 --> 1:51:31.120
 The protraction of the war for a further two years,

1:51:32.040 --> 1:51:33.240
 its globalization,

1:51:33.240 --> 1:51:35.640
 which Britain's intervention made inevitable.

1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:39.440
 As Philip Zelikow showed in his recent book

1:51:39.440 --> 1:51:43.520
 on the failure to make peace in 1916,

1:51:43.520 --> 1:51:45.880
 Woodrow Wilson tried and failed to intervene

1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:47.760
 and broke a peace in 1916.

1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:50.840
 So I'm not the only counterfactualist here.

1:51:50.840 --> 1:51:53.440
 The extension of the war for a further two years

1:51:53.440 --> 1:51:56.160
 with escalating slaughter, the death toll rose

1:51:56.160 --> 1:52:00.520
 because the industrial capacity of the armies grew greater.

1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:04.440
 That's what condemns us to the Bolshevik Revolution.

1:52:04.440 --> 1:52:08.960
 And it's what condemns us ultimately to Nazism,

1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:13.800
 because it's out of the experience of defeat in 1918

1:52:13.800 --> 1:52:15.600
 as Hitler makes clear in mind camp

1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:19.360
 that he becomes radicalized and enters the political realm.

1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:23.920
 Take out those additional years of war

1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:26.200
 and Hitler's just a failed artist.

1:52:26.200 --> 1:52:31.200
 It's the end of the war that turns him into the demagogue.

1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:34.920
 You asked what are the things

1:52:34.920 --> 1:52:38.920
 that have all avoid the totalitarian states?

1:52:38.920 --> 1:52:41.400
 As I've said, British non intervention for me

1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:42.880
 is the most plausible

1:52:42.880 --> 1:52:45.800
 and it takes out all of that malignant history

1:52:45.800 --> 1:52:48.280
 that follows from the Bolshevik Revolution.

1:52:48.280 --> 1:52:51.040
 It's very hard for me to see how Lenin gets anywhere

1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:52.360
 if the war is over.

1:52:53.800 --> 1:52:55.320
 That looks like the opportunity

1:52:55.320 --> 1:52:59.840
 for the constitutional elements,

1:52:59.840 --> 1:53:02.640
 the liberal elements in Russia.

1:53:02.640 --> 1:53:05.840
 There are other moments at which you can imagine history

1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:10.840
 taking a different path, if the provisional government

1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:14.120
 in Russia had been more ruthless,

1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:17.520
 it was very lenient towards the Bolsheviks,

1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:19.120
 but if it had just rounded them up

1:53:19.120 --> 1:53:20.760
 and shot the Bolshevik leadership,

1:53:20.760 --> 1:53:25.080
 that would have certainly cut the Bolshevik Revolution off.

1:53:25.080 --> 1:53:29.240
 One looks back on the conduct of the Russian liberals

1:53:29.240 --> 1:53:32.200
 with the kind of despair at their failure

1:53:32.200 --> 1:53:34.800
 to see the scale of the threat that they face

1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:36.800
 and the ruthlessness that the Bolshevik leadership

1:53:36.800 --> 1:53:37.640
 would evince.

1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:42.160
 There's a counterfactual in Germany, which is interesting.

1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:45.040
 I think the Weimar Republic destroyed itself

1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:49.840
 into disastrous economic calamities,

1:53:49.840 --> 1:53:51.880
 the inflation and then the deflation.

1:53:52.800 --> 1:53:54.800
 It's difficult for me to imagine Hitler

1:53:54.800 --> 1:53:58.240
 getting to be Reich Chancellor

1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:01.080
 without those huge economic disasters.

1:54:01.080 --> 1:54:03.840
 So another part of my early work explored

1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:07.840
 alternative policy options that the German Republic,

1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:10.000
 the Weimar Republic might have pursued.

1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:14.240
 There are other contingencies that spring to mind.

1:54:14.240 --> 1:54:17.880
 In 1936 or 38, I think more plausibly, 38,

1:54:18.920 --> 1:54:21.240
 Britain should have gone to war.

1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:22.960
 The great mistake was Munich.

1:54:24.760 --> 1:54:29.120
 Hitler was in an extremely vulnerable position in 1938,

1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:31.560
 because remember, he didn't have Russia squared away

1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:33.880
 as he would in 1939.

1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:36.400
 Chamberlain's mistake was to fold

1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:41.160
 instead of going for war as Churchill rightly saw.

1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:44.360
 And there was a magical opportunity there

1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:45.520
 that would have played into the hands

1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:48.160
 of the German military opposition and conservatives

1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:52.960
 to snuff Hitler out over Czechoslovakia.

1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:53.800
 I could go on.

1:54:53.800 --> 1:54:58.800
 The point is that history is not some inexorable narrative,

1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:01.200
 which can only end one way.

1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:03.760
 It's a garden of forking paths

1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:08.240
 and many, many junctions in the road

1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:11.920
 that were choices that could have averted

1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:14.400
 the calamities of the mid 20th century.

1:55:14.400 --> 1:55:16.440
 I have to ask you about this moment

1:55:16.440 --> 1:55:18.080
 before you said I could go on.

1:55:18.080 --> 1:55:22.640
 This moment of Chamberlain and Snuff Hitler out

1:55:22.640 --> 1:55:24.320
 in terms of Czechoslovakia,

1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:29.080
 and we'll return to the book Doom on this point.

1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:32.280
 What does it take to be a great leader

1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:33.640
 in the room with Hitler,

1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:38.640
 or in the same time and space as Hitler

1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:42.240
 to snuff him out, to make the right decisions?

1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:45.880
 So it sounds like you put quite a bit

1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:49.040
 of a blame on the man, Chamberlain,

1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:53.360
 and give credit to somebody like a Churchill.

1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:54.280
 So what is the difference?

1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:55.400
 Where's that line?

1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:58.920
 You've also written a book about Henry Kissinger,

1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:01.200
 who was an interesting sort of person

1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:04.800
 that's been throughout many difficult decisions

1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:06.200
 in the games of power.

1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:08.520
 So what does it take to be a great leader in that moment?

1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:10.640
 That particular moment, sorry to keep talking,

1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:12.280
 is fascinating to me,

1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:15.760
 because it feels like it's man on man conversations

1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:17.680
 that define history.

1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:19.600
 Well, Hitler was bluffing.

1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:21.760
 He really wasn't ready for war in 1938.

1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:25.760
 The German economy was clearly not ready for war in 1938.

1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:30.760
 And Chamberlain made a fundamental miscalculation,

1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:32.360
 along with his advisors,

1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:33.720
 because it wasn't all Chamberlain.

1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:38.720
 He was, in many ways, articulating the establishment view.

1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:41.480
 And I tried to show in a book called War of the World,

1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:42.760
 how that establishment worked.

1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:45.080
 It extended through the BBC,

1:56:45.080 --> 1:56:46.880
 into the aristocracy, to Oxford.

1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:48.040
 There was an establishment view.

1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:49.800
 Chamberlain personified it.

1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:53.040
 Churchill was seen as a warmonger.

1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:56.280
 He was at his lowest point of popularity in 1938.

1:56:56.280 --> 1:56:59.080
 But what is it that Chamberlain gets wrong?

1:56:59.080 --> 1:57:00.800
 Because it's conceptual.

1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:03.680
 Chamberlain is persuaded that Britain has to play for time,

1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:06.800
 because Britain is not ready for war in 1938.

1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:09.800
 He fails to see that the time that he gets,

1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:13.520
 that he buys at Munich, is also available to Hitler.

1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:15.200
 Everybody gets the time.

1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:17.000
 And Hitler's able to do much more with it,

1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.960
 because Hitler strikes the pact with Stalin,

1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:23.400
 that guarantees that Germany can fight

1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:25.920
 a war on one front in 1939.

1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:26.880
 What does Chamberlain do?

1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:28.760
 Builds some more aircraft.

1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:31.360
 So the great mistake of the strategy of appeasement

1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:32.800
 was to play for time.

1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:34.160
 I mean, they knew war was coming,

1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:35.120
 but they were playing for time,

1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:39.200
 not realizing that Hitler got the time too.

1:57:39.200 --> 1:57:42.040
 And after he partitioned Czechoslovakia,

1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:43.800
 he was in a much stronger position,

1:57:43.800 --> 1:57:45.400
 not least because of all the resources

1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:50.400
 that they were able to plunder from Czechoslovakia.

1:57:50.760 --> 1:57:52.720
 So that was the conceptual mistake.

1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:57.240
 Churchill played an heroic role in pointing out

1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:00.960
 this mistake and predicting accurately

1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:04.080
 that it would lead to war on worse terms.

1:58:04.080 --> 1:58:05.680
 What does it take?

1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:10.680
 It takes distinct courage to be unpopular.

1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:13.640
 And Churchill was deeply unpopular at that point.

1:58:13.640 --> 1:58:16.520
 People would listen to him in the House of Commons

1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:19.080
 in silence on one occasion.

1:58:20.040 --> 1:58:21.960
 Lady Astor shouted, rubbish.

1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:25.200
 So he went through a period of being hated on.

1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:29.080
 The other thing that made Churchill a formidable leader

1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:31.840
 was that he always applied history to the problem.

1:58:32.720 --> 1:58:35.120
 And that's why he gets it right.

1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:38.280
 He sees the historical problem much more clearly

1:58:38.280 --> 1:58:39.880
 than Chamberlain.

1:58:39.880 --> 1:58:44.320
 So I think if you go back to 1938,

1:58:44.320 --> 1:58:45.920
 there's no realistic counterfactual

1:58:45.920 --> 1:58:48.000
 in which Churchill's in government in 1938.

1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:49.800
 You have to have France collapse

1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:51.880
 for Churchill to come into government.

1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:56.880
 But you can certainly imagine a Tory elite

1:58:57.240 --> 1:59:02.240
 that's thinking more clearly about the likely dynamics.

1:59:02.320 --> 1:59:06.320
 They haven't seen this, I guess, problem of conjecture

1:59:06.320 --> 1:59:08.880
 to take a phrase from Kissinger,

1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:11.560
 which is that whatever they're doing

1:59:11.560 --> 1:59:14.960
 in postponing the war has the potential

1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:18.760
 to create a worse starting point for the war.

1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:21.920
 It would have been risky in 1938,

1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:24.560
 but it was a way better situation than they ended up with

1:59:24.560 --> 1:59:26.480
 in 1939, a year later.

1:59:27.280 --> 1:59:28.920
 You asked about Kissinger and I've learned a lot

1:59:28.920 --> 1:59:33.160
 from reading Kissinger and talking to Kissinger

1:59:33.160 --> 1:59:35.760
 since I embarked on writing his biography

1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:37.160
 great many years ago.

1:59:37.160 --> 1:59:39.960
 I think one of the most important things I've learned

1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:45.960
 is that you can apply history to contemporary problems.

1:59:45.960 --> 1:59:49.040
 It may be the most important tool that we have

1:59:49.040 --> 1:59:51.880
 in that kind of decision making.

1:59:51.880 --> 1:59:56.880
 You have to do it quite ruthlessly and rigorously.

1:59:57.760 --> 2:00:02.760
 And in the moment of crisis, you have to take risk.

2:00:02.760 --> 2:00:07.760
 So Kissinger often says in his early work,

2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:12.280
 the temptation of the bureaucrat is to wait for more data,

2:00:12.280 --> 2:00:14.520
 but ultimately the decision making

2:00:14.520 --> 2:00:18.480
 that we do under uncertainty can't be based on data.

2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:21.280
 The problem of conjecture is that you could take an action

2:00:21.280 --> 2:00:26.280
 now and incur some cost, an avert disaster,

2:00:27.400 --> 2:00:28.680
 but you'll get no thanks for it

2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:31.240
 because nobody is grateful for an averted disaster.

2:00:31.240 --> 2:00:33.440
 And nobody goes around saying,

2:00:33.440 --> 2:00:36.280
 wasn't it wonderful how we didn't have another 911?

2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:40.760
 On the other hand, you can do nothing

2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:44.120
 incur no upfront costs and hope for the best.

2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:47.440
 And you might get lucky the disaster might not happen.

2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:49.480
 That's in a democratic system,

2:00:49.480 --> 2:00:53.040
 the much easier path to take.

2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:59.280
 And I think that the essence of leadership is to be ready

2:00:59.280 --> 2:01:01.760
 to take that upfront cost, avert the disaster

2:01:01.760 --> 2:01:03.520
 and accept that you won't get gratitude.

2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:10.160
 If I may make a comment and a side about Henry Kissinger.

2:01:10.160 --> 2:01:14.200
 So he, I think at 98 years old currently,

2:01:14.200 --> 2:01:17.480
 has still got it, he's brilliant.

2:01:17.480 --> 2:01:18.760
 It's very, very impressive.

2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:23.080
 I can only hope that my brain has the same durability

2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:25.840
 that his does because it's a formidable intellect

2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:30.840
 and it's still in as sharp form as it was 50 years ago.

2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:34.080
 So you mentioned Eric Schmitz in his book.

2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:36.800
 They reached out to me, they didn't want to do this podcast.

2:01:37.840 --> 2:01:41.200
 And I know Eric Schmit, I've spoken to him before,

2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:43.880
 I like him a lot, obviously.

2:01:43.880 --> 2:01:48.880
 So they said, we could do a podcast for 40 minutes with Eric,

2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:52.520
 40 minutes with Eric and Henry together

2:01:52.520 --> 2:01:54.840
 and 40 minutes with Henry.

2:01:54.840 --> 2:01:57.920
 So there's a three different conversations.

2:01:57.920 --> 2:02:00.800
 And I had to like, I had to do some soul searching

2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:02.680
 because I said, fine, 40 minutes with Eric,

2:02:02.680 --> 2:02:04.640
 we'll probably talk many times again.

2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:09.080
 Fine, let's talk about this AI book together for 40 minutes.

2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:12.640
 But I said, what I wrote to them is that I would hate myself

2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:16.480
 if I only have 40 minutes to talk to Henry Kissinger.

2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:18.680
 And so I had to hold my ground, went back and forth

2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:21.000
 and in the end decided to part ways over this.

2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:25.640
 And I sometimes think about this kind of difficult decision

2:02:27.680 --> 2:02:32.680
 in the podcasting space of when do you walk away?

2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:38.720
 Because there's a particular world leader

2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:40.360
 that I've mentioned in the past

2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:43.720
 where the conversation is very likely to happen.

2:02:43.720 --> 2:02:48.720
 And as it happens, those conversations could often be,

2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:52.120
 you know, unfortunately, this person only has 30 minutes now.

2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:54.680
 I know we agreed for three hours, but unfortunately,

2:02:54.680 --> 2:02:59.680
 and you have to decide, do I stand my ground on this point?

2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:01.720
 I suppose that's the thing that journalists

2:03:01.720 --> 2:03:03.440
 have to think about, right?

2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:08.440
 Like, do I hold on to my integrity

2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:11.320
 in whatever form that takes and do I stay my ground

2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:14.720
 even if I lose a fascinating opportunity?

2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:16.720
 Anyway, it's something I thought about

2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:19.720
 and something I think about.

2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:21.680
 And with Henry Kissinger, I mean,

2:03:22.880 --> 2:03:25.720
 he's had a million amazing conversations in your biography

2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:27.240
 so it's not like something is lost,

2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:29.680
 but it was still nevertheless to me some soul searching

2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:32.520
 that had to do as a kind of practice

2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:36.800
 for what to me is a higher stakes conversation.

2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:38.880
 I'll just mention is Vladimir Putin,

2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:41.720
 I can have a conversation with him

2:03:41.720 --> 2:03:44.400
 unlike any conversation he's ever had,

2:03:44.400 --> 2:03:47.800
 partially because I'm a fluent Russian speaker,

2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:49.600
 partially because I'm messed up in the head

2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:50.520
 in certain kinds of ways

2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:52.720
 that make for an interesting dynamic

2:03:52.720 --> 2:03:54.400
 because we're both judo people,

2:03:54.400 --> 2:03:58.560
 we're both are certain kinds of human beings

2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:02.120
 that can have a much deeper apolitical conversation.

2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:05.880
 I have to ask to stay on the topic of leadership.

2:04:05.880 --> 2:04:08.360
 You've in your book, Doom,

2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:12.240
 have talked about wars, pandemics throughout human history

2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:17.240
 and in some sense saying that all of these disasters

2:04:18.440 --> 2:04:20.240
 are manmade.

2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:23.560
 So humans have a role in terms of the magnitude

2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:26.160
 of the effect that they have on human civilization.

2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:30.200
 Without taking cheap political shots,

2:04:30.200 --> 2:04:32.120
 can we talk about COVID 19?

2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:38.040
 How will history remember the COVID 19 pandemic?

2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:41.600
 What were the successes, what were the failures

2:04:41.600 --> 2:04:45.240
 of leadership of man, of humans?

2:04:46.920 --> 2:04:51.520
 Doom was a book that I was planning to write

2:04:51.520 --> 2:04:56.520
 before the pandemic struck as a history of the future

2:04:56.560 --> 2:04:59.640
 based in large measure on science fiction.

2:04:59.640 --> 2:05:01.560
 It had occurred to me in 2019

2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:04.400
 that I had spent too long not reading science fiction

2:05:04.400 --> 2:05:09.400
 and so I decided I would liven up my intake

2:05:09.400 --> 2:05:14.040
 by getting off history for a bit and reading science fiction.

2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:16.320
 Because history is great at telling you

2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:18.560
 about the perennial problems of power.

2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:20.960
 Putin is always interesting on history.

2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:23.160
 He's become something of a historian recently

2:05:23.160 --> 2:05:25.800
 with his essays and lectures.

2:05:25.800 --> 2:05:27.480
 But what history is bad at telling you is,

2:05:27.480 --> 2:05:29.960
 well, what will the effects of discontinuity

2:05:29.960 --> 2:05:31.800
 of technology be?

2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:33.360
 And so I thought I need some science fiction

2:05:33.360 --> 2:05:34.480
 to think more about this

2:05:34.480 --> 2:05:38.400
 because I'm tending to miss the importance

2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:40.120
 of technological discontinuity.

2:05:41.480 --> 2:05:43.000
 If you read a lot of science fiction,

2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:45.600
 you read a lot of plague books

2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:47.480
 because science fiction writers

2:05:47.480 --> 2:05:50.280
 are really quite fond of the plague scenario.

2:05:50.280 --> 2:05:52.480
 So the world ends in many ways in science fiction

2:05:52.480 --> 2:05:54.640
 but one of the most popular is the lethal pandemic.

2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:58.480
 So when the first email came to me,

2:05:58.480 --> 2:05:59.920
 I think it was on January the third

2:05:59.920 --> 2:06:01.920
 from my medical friend Justin Stepping,

2:06:01.920 --> 2:06:06.920
 funny pneumonia in Wuhan, my antennae began to tingle

2:06:06.920 --> 2:06:10.080
 because it was just like one of those science fiction books

2:06:10.080 --> 2:06:11.680
 that begins in just that way.

2:06:14.440 --> 2:06:18.640
 In a pandemic, as Larry Brilliant,

2:06:18.640 --> 2:06:20.680
 the epidemiologist said many years ago,

2:06:20.680 --> 2:06:25.240
 the key is early detection and early action.

2:06:25.240 --> 2:06:27.160
 That's how you deal with a novel pathogen.

2:06:28.600 --> 2:06:30.360
 And almost no Western country did that.

2:06:31.680 --> 2:06:32.680
 We know it was doable

2:06:32.680 --> 2:06:35.280
 because the Taiwanese and the South Koreans did it

2:06:35.280 --> 2:06:37.680
 and they did it very well.

2:06:37.680 --> 2:06:41.360
 But really no Western country got this right.

2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:43.840
 Some were unlucky because super spreader events

2:06:43.840 --> 2:06:46.120
 happened earlier than in other countries.

2:06:46.120 --> 2:06:48.440
 Italy was hit very hard very early.

2:06:48.440 --> 2:06:50.960
 For other countries, the real disaster came quite late,

2:06:50.960 --> 2:06:53.920
 Russia, which has only relatively recently

2:06:53.920 --> 2:06:55.960
 had a really bad experience.

2:06:57.200 --> 2:06:59.880
 The lesson for me is quite different

2:06:59.880 --> 2:07:01.920
 from the one that most journalists

2:07:01.920 --> 2:07:03.800
 thought they were learning last year.

2:07:03.800 --> 2:07:06.280
 Most journalists last year thought,

2:07:06.280 --> 2:07:08.240
 Trump is a terrible president.

2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:10.640
 He's saying a lot of crazy things.

2:07:10.640 --> 2:07:13.160
 It's his fault that we have high access mortality

2:07:13.160 --> 2:07:15.000
 in the United States.

2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:16.840
 The same argument was being made

2:07:16.840 --> 2:07:19.800
 by journalists in Britain, Boris Johnson, dot, dot, dot,

2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:22.160
 Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, dot, dot, dot,

2:07:22.160 --> 2:07:25.480
 even India, Narendra Modi, the same argument.

2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:30.640
 And I think this argument is wrong in a few ways.

2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:32.920
 It's true that the populist leaders

2:07:32.920 --> 2:07:35.120
 said many crazy things.

2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:37.480
 And, broadly speaking, gave poor guidance

2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:40.680
 to their populations.

2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:43.480
 But I don't think it's true to say

2:07:43.480 --> 2:07:44.640
 that with different leaders,

2:07:44.640 --> 2:07:46.920
 these countries would have done significantly better

2:07:46.920 --> 2:07:50.400
 if Joe Biden had magically been president a year earlier.

2:07:50.400 --> 2:07:52.360
 I don't think the US would have done much better

2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:55.560
 because the things that caused access mortality last year

2:07:55.560 --> 2:07:57.040
 weren't presidential decisions.

2:07:57.040 --> 2:08:00.920
 They were utter failure of CDC to provide testing.

2:08:00.920 --> 2:08:03.000
 That definitely wasn't Trump's fault.

2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:04.920
 Scott Gottlieb's book makes that very clear.

2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:06.880
 It's just been published recently.

2:08:06.880 --> 2:08:10.200
 We utterly failed to use technology for contact tracing,

2:08:10.200 --> 2:08:12.560
 which the Koreans did very well.

2:08:12.560 --> 2:08:16.600
 We didn't really quarantine anybody seriously.

2:08:16.600 --> 2:08:19.120
 There was no enforcement of quarantine.

2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:21.120
 And we exposed the elderly to the virus

2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:23.480
 as quickly as possible in elderly care homes.

2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:25.720
 And these things had very little to do

2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:28.080
 with presidential incompetence.

2:08:28.080 --> 2:08:33.640
 So I think leadership is of somewhat marginal importance

2:08:33.640 --> 2:08:35.600
 in a crisis like this, because what you really need

2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:38.080
 is your public health bureaucracy to get it right.

2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:42.200
 And very few Western public health bureaucracies got it right.

2:08:42.200 --> 2:08:45.400
 Could the president have given better leadership?

2:08:45.400 --> 2:08:47.080
 Yes.

2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:50.600
 His correct strategy, however, was

2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:52.720
 to learn from Barack Obama's playbook

2:08:52.720 --> 2:08:55.200
 with the opioid epidemic.

2:08:55.200 --> 2:08:59.400
 The opioid epidemic killed as many people on Obama's watch

2:08:59.400 --> 2:09:01.880
 as COVID did on Trump's watch.

2:09:01.880 --> 2:09:04.080
 And it was worse in the sense, because it only happened

2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:05.080
 in the US.

2:09:05.080 --> 2:09:07.280
 And each year, it killed more people than the year

2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:09.240
 before, over eight years.

2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:12.680
 Nobody, to my knowledge, has ever seriously blamed Obama

2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:14.800
 for the opioid epidemic.

2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:17.600
 Trump's mistake was to put himself front and center

2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:21.120
 of the response to claim that he had some unique insight

2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:24.840
 into the pandemic and to say, with every passing week,

2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:26.080
 more and more foolish things.

2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:29.160
 Until even a significant portion of people

2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:31.280
 who'd voted for him in 2016 realized

2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:34.160
 that he'd blown it, which was why he lost the election.

2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:36.040
 The correct strategy was actually

2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:39.080
 to make Mike Pence the pandemic star

2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:40.960
 and get the hell out of the way.

2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:43.200
 That's what my advice to Trump would have been, in fact,

2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:45.720
 it was in February of last year.

2:09:45.720 --> 2:09:49.920
 So the mistake was to try to lead.

2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:52.560
 But actually, leadership in a pandemic

2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:54.080
 is almost the contradiction in terms.

2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:56.680
 What you really need is your public health bureaucracy

2:09:56.680 --> 2:09:58.360
 not to fuck it up.

2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:00.480
 And they really, really fucked it up.

2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:02.160
 And that was then all blamed on Trump.

2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:02.760
 Yes.

2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:05.400
 You know, Jim Fallows writes a piece in The Atlantic that says,

2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:07.760
 well, being the president's like flying a light aircraft,

2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:09.000
 it's pilot error.

2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:10.480
 And I read that piece and I thought,

2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:13.160
 does he really, after all the years he's spent writing,

2:10:13.160 --> 2:10:16.160
 think that being president is like flying a light aircraft?

2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:19.120
 I mean, it's really nothing like flying a light aircraft.

2:10:19.120 --> 2:10:22.360
 Being president is you sit on top of a vast bureaucracy

2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:24.400
 with how many different agencies, 60, 70,

2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:25.880
 we've all lost count.

2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:27.680
 And you're surrounded by advisors,

2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:29.720
 at least a quarter of whom are saying,

2:10:29.720 --> 2:10:31.720
 this is a disaster, we have to close the borders.

2:10:31.720 --> 2:10:34.440
 And the others are saying, no, no, we have to keep the economy

2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:37.120
 going, that's what you're running on in November.

2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:39.160
 So being a president in a pandemic

2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:41.960
 is a very unenviable position.

2:10:41.960 --> 2:10:45.440
 Because you actually can't, you can't really determine

2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:47.840
 whether your public health bureaucracy will get it right

2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:48.440
 or not.

2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:50.480
 You don't think to push back on that,

2:10:50.480 --> 2:10:54.120
 it's just like being Churchill in a war is difficult.

2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:57.040
 So leaving Trump a buy and a side,

2:10:57.040 --> 2:10:58.920
 what I would love to see from a president

2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:03.240
 is somebody who makes great speeches

2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:06.400
 and arouses the public to push to bureaucracy,

2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:09.760
 the public health bureaucracy, to get their shit together,

2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:11.600
 to fire certain kinds of people.

2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:15.160
 I mean, I'm sorry, but I'm a big fan of powerful speeches,

2:11:15.160 --> 2:11:17.360
 especially in the modern age with the internet,

2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:19.520
 it can really move people.

2:11:19.520 --> 2:11:23.880
 Instead, the lack of speeches resulted

2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:29.120
 in certain kinds of forces amplifying division

2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:32.680
 over whether wear masks or not.

2:11:32.680 --> 2:11:34.720
 It's almost like the public picked

2:11:34.720 --> 2:11:37.640
 some random topic over which to divide themselves.

2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:39.800
 And there was a complete indecision,

2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:44.000
 which is really what it was fear of uncertainty

2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.520
 materializing itself in some kind of division.

2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:49.760
 And then you almost like busy yourself with the red versus

2:11:49.760 --> 2:11:52.480
 blue politics, as opposed to some, I don't know,

2:11:52.480 --> 2:11:55.880
 FDR type character just stands and say,

2:11:57.640 --> 2:11:59.880
 fuck all this bullshit that we're hearing,

2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:02.680
 we're going to manufacture five billion tests.

2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:04.320
 This is what America is great at.

2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:07.560
 We're going to build the greatest testing infrastructure

2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:12.440
 ever built or something, or even with the vaccine development.

2:12:12.440 --> 2:12:15.280
 But that was what I was about to interject.

2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:18.440
 In a pandemic, the most important thing is the vaccine.

2:12:18.440 --> 2:12:20.600
 If you get that right, then you should be forgiven

2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:21.600
 for much else.

2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:23.280
 And that was the one thing the Trump administration

2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:27.520
 got right because they went around the bureaucracy

2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:29.880
 with Operation Warp Speed and achieved

2:12:29.880 --> 2:12:32.240
 a really major success.

2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:38.280
 So I think the paradox of the 2020 story

2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:42.200
 in the United States is that the one thing

2:12:42.200 --> 2:12:45.680
 that mattered most, the Trump administration got right.

2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:49.080
 And it got so much else wrong that was sort of marginal

2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:51.000
 that we were left with the impression

2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:53.920
 that Trump had been to blame for the whole disaster,

2:12:53.920 --> 2:12:56.360
 which wasn't really quite right.

2:12:56.360 --> 2:12:57.480
 Sure, it would have been great

2:12:57.480 --> 2:13:00.120
 if we did Operation Warp Speed for testing,

2:13:00.120 --> 2:13:02.920
 but ultimately vaccines are more important than tests.

2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:06.600
 And this brings me to the question

2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:09.360
 that you raised there of polarization

2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:11.720
 and why that happened.

2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:13.960
 Now, in a book called The Square and the Tower,

2:13:13.960 --> 2:13:17.120
 I argued that it would be very costly for the United States

2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:20.720
 to allow the public sphere to continue to be dominated

2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:22.440
 by a handful of big tech companies

2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:25.280
 that this ultimately would have more adverse effects

2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:27.400
 than simply contested elections.

2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:31.280
 And I think we saw over the past 18 months

2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:35.480
 just how bad this could be because the odd thing

2:13:35.480 --> 2:13:39.320
 about this country is that we came up with vaccines

2:13:39.320 --> 2:13:42.240
 with 90 plus percent efficacy

2:13:42.240 --> 2:13:44.920
 and about 20% of people refused to get them

2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:49.920
 and still do refuse for reasons that seem best explained

2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:54.200
 in terms of the anti vaccine network,

2:13:54.200 --> 2:13:56.080
 which has been embedded on the internet

2:13:56.080 --> 2:13:58.600
 for a long time predating the pandemic.

2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:02.480
 Rene de Resta wrote about this pre 2020.

2:14:02.480 --> 2:14:04.760
 And this anti vaccine network has turned out

2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:07.000
 to kill maybe 200,000 Americans

2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:08.240
 who could have been vaccinated

2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:11.120
 but were persuaded through magical thinking

2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:14.040
 that the vaccine was riskier than the virus.

2:14:14.040 --> 2:14:17.040
 Whereas you don't need to be an epidemiology,

2:14:17.040 --> 2:14:18.680
 don't need to be a medical scientist to know

2:14:18.680 --> 2:14:20.680
 that the virus is about two orders

2:14:20.680 --> 2:14:22.800
 of magnitude riskier than the vaccine.

2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:28.920
 So again, leadership could definitely have been better

2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:32.560
 but the politicization of everything

2:14:33.640 --> 2:14:35.480
 was not Trump's doing alone.

2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:39.800
 It happened because our public sphere has been dominated

2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:43.960
 by a handful of platforms whose business model

2:14:43.960 --> 2:14:46.080
 inherently promotes polarization,

2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:49.120
 inherently promotes fake news and extreme views

2:14:49.120 --> 2:14:51.440
 because those are the things that get the eyeballs

2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:53.200
 and the screens and sell the ads.

2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:55.160
 I mean, this is now a commonplace

2:14:55.160 --> 2:14:57.360
 but when one thinks about the cost

2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:01.880
 of allowing this kind of thing to happen,

2:15:01.880 --> 2:15:04.160
 it's now a very high human cost.

2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:07.000
 And we were foolish to leave uncorrected

2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.320
 these structural problems in the public sphere

2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:12.840
 that were already very clearly visible in 2016.

2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:16.120
 And you described that like you mentioned

2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:18.320
 that there's these networks that are almost like

2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:22.840
 laying dormant, waiting for their time in the sun.

2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:25.400
 And they stepped forward in this case.

2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:30.160
 And that those network effects just the service catalyst

2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:34.480
 for whatever the bad parts of human nature.

2:15:34.480 --> 2:15:36.360
 I do hope that there's kinds of networks

2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:38.720
 that emphasize the better angels of our nature

2:15:38.720 --> 2:15:40.800
 to cause Steven Pinker.

2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:43.520
 It's just clearly, and we know this

2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:46.360
 from all the revelations of the Facebook whistleblower,

2:15:46.360 --> 2:15:49.760
 there is clearly a very clear tension

2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:54.120
 between the business model of a company like Facebook

2:15:54.120 --> 2:15:56.360
 and the public good.

2:15:56.360 --> 2:15:57.680
 And they know that.

2:15:57.680 --> 2:15:59.480
 I just talked to the founder of Instagram.

2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:03.840
 I, yes, that's the case, but it's not

2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:06.000
 from a technology perspective,

2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:08.520
 like absolutely true of any kind of social network.

2:16:08.520 --> 2:16:09.880
 I think it's possible to build.

2:16:09.880 --> 2:16:12.080
 Actually, I think it's not just possible.

2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:15.040
 I think it's pretty easy if you set that as the goal

2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:18.480
 to build social networks that don't have

2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:20.680
 these negative effects.

2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:25.680
 Right, but if the business model is we sell ads

2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:30.240
 and the way you sell ads is to maximize user engagement,

2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:32.160
 then the algorithm is biased in favor

2:16:32.160 --> 2:16:33.320
 of fake news and extreme views.

2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:34.840
 But it's not, so it's not the ads.

2:16:34.840 --> 2:16:36.600
 A lot of people blame the ads.

2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:40.400
 The problem I think is the engagement

2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:42.040
 and the engagement is just the easiest,

2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:43.920
 the dumbest way to sell the ads.

2:16:43.920 --> 2:16:46.160
 I think there's much different metrics

2:16:46.160 --> 2:16:48.800
 that could be used to make a lot more money

2:16:48.800 --> 2:16:51.040
 than the engagement in the longterm.

2:16:51.040 --> 2:16:53.480
 It has more to do with planning for the longterm.

2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:57.600
 So optimizing the selling of ads

2:16:57.600 --> 2:17:02.600
 to make people happy with themselves in the longterm

2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:07.400
 as opposed to some kind of addicted, like dopamine feeling.

2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:09.960
 And so that's, to me, that has to do with metrics

2:17:09.960 --> 2:17:11.360
 and measuring things correctly

2:17:11.360 --> 2:17:13.560
 and sort of also creating a culture

2:17:13.560 --> 2:17:16.800
 with what's valued to have difficult conversations

2:17:16.800 --> 2:17:18.440
 about what we're doing with society,

2:17:18.440 --> 2:17:19.600
 all those kinds of things.

2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:22.000
 And I think once you have those conversations,

2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:23.840
 this takes us back to the University of Austin,

2:17:23.840 --> 2:17:27.120
 kind of, once you have those difficult human conversations,

2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:28.520
 you can design the technology

2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:32.640
 that will actually make for help people grow,

2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:34.320
 become the best version of themselves,

2:17:34.320 --> 2:17:36.000
 help them be happy in the longterm.

2:17:36.920 --> 2:17:41.920
 What gives you hope about the future?

2:17:41.960 --> 2:17:44.600
 As somebody who studied some of the darker moments

2:17:44.600 --> 2:17:47.040
 of human history, what gives you hope?

2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:50.240
 A couple of things.

2:17:52.560 --> 2:17:56.520
 First of all, the United States

2:17:56.520 --> 2:17:58.920
 has a very unique operating system,

2:17:59.880 --> 2:18:02.200
 which was very well designed by the founders

2:18:02.200 --> 2:18:03.320
 who thought a lot about history

2:18:03.320 --> 2:18:07.880
 and realized it would take quite a novel design

2:18:07.880 --> 2:18:10.920
 to prevent the Republic going the way of all republics

2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:12.920
 because republics tend to end up as tyrannies

2:18:12.920 --> 2:18:14.960
 for reasons that were well established

2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:16.920
 by the time of the Renaissance.

2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:20.680
 And it gives me hope that this design has worked very well

2:18:20.680 --> 2:18:22.880
 and withstood an enormous stress test,

2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:25.560
 stress test in the last year.

2:18:25.560 --> 2:18:27.560
 I became an American in 2018.

2:18:28.840 --> 2:18:32.880
 I think one of the most important features

2:18:32.880 --> 2:18:37.640
 of this operating system is that it is the magnet for talent.

2:18:38.840 --> 2:18:40.080
 Here we sit,

2:18:41.960 --> 2:18:44.600
 part of the immigration story.

2:18:44.600 --> 2:18:49.600
 In a darkened room with funny accents.

2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:54.200
 Scott and a Russian walk into a recording studio

2:18:54.200 --> 2:18:55.960
 and talk about America.

2:18:55.960 --> 2:18:57.960
 It's very much like a joke.

2:18:57.960 --> 2:19:00.720
 And Elon's a South African and so on and Teal is a German.

2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:03.760
 And we're extraordinarily fortunate

2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:06.000
 that the natives let us come and play

2:19:07.120 --> 2:19:12.000
 and play in a way that we could not in our countries of birth.

2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:15.320
 And as long as the United States continues to exploit

2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:18.760
 that superpower that it is the talent magnet,

2:19:18.760 --> 2:19:20.760
 then it should out innovate

2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:24.280
 the totalitarian competition every time.

2:19:24.280 --> 2:19:29.280
 So that's one reason for being an optimist.

2:19:30.440 --> 2:19:33.200
 Another reason, and it's quite a historical reason

2:19:33.200 --> 2:19:34.760
 as you would expect from me.

2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:39.040
 Another reason that I'm optimistic

2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:44.040
 is that my kids give me a great deal of hope.

2:19:45.080 --> 2:19:48.720
 They range in age from 27 down to four.

2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:52.760
 But each of them in their different way

2:19:52.760 --> 2:19:57.760
 seems to be finding a way through this crazy time of ours

2:19:58.800 --> 2:20:03.800
 without losing contact with that culture and civilization

2:20:06.600 --> 2:20:08.080
 that I hold dear.

2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:10.040
 I don't want to live in the metaverse

2:20:10.040 --> 2:20:12.680
 as Mark Zuckerberg imagines it.

2:20:12.680 --> 2:20:14.960
 To me, that's a kind of ghastly hell.

2:20:15.920 --> 2:20:21.000
 I think Western civilization is the best civilization.

2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:23.920
 And I think that almost all the truths

2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:26.480
 about the human condition can be found

2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:32.520
 in Western literature, art and music.

2:20:34.400 --> 2:20:37.040
 And I think also that the civilization

2:20:37.040 --> 2:20:39.080
 that produced the scientific revolution

2:20:39.080 --> 2:20:42.960
 has produced the great problem solving tool

2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:44.800
 that eluded the other civilizations

2:20:44.800 --> 2:20:47.640
 that never really cracked science.

2:20:49.120 --> 2:20:52.800
 And what gives me hope is that despite all the temptations

2:20:52.800 --> 2:20:57.520
 and distractions that their generation had to contend with,

2:20:57.520 --> 2:20:59.000
 my children and their different ways

2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:04.000
 have found their way to literature and to art and to music.

2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:05.720
 And they are civilized.

2:21:06.720 --> 2:21:11.720
 And I don't claim much of the credit for that.

2:21:11.720 --> 2:21:15.720
 I've done my best, but I think it's deeply encouraging

2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:19.240
 that they found their way to the things

2:21:19.240 --> 2:21:22.760
 that I think are indispensable for a happy life,

2:21:22.760 --> 2:21:24.240
 a fulfilled life.

2:21:24.240 --> 2:21:26.840
 Nobody, I think, can be truly fulfilled

2:21:27.840 --> 2:21:29.720
 if they're cut off from the great body

2:21:29.720 --> 2:21:32.240
 of Western literature, for example.

2:21:32.240 --> 2:21:36.240
 I've thought a lot about Elon's argument

2:21:36.240 --> 2:21:38.240
 that we might be in a simulation.

2:21:39.520 --> 2:21:42.920
 No, no, there is a simulation, it's called literature.

2:21:42.920 --> 2:21:46.720
 And we just have to decide whether or not to enter it.

2:21:46.720 --> 2:21:51.720
 I'm currently in the midst of the later stages

2:21:51.720 --> 2:21:55.720
 of Proust's great, a la recherche du temps perdu

2:21:55.720 --> 2:21:59.720
 and Proust's observation of human relationships

2:21:59.720 --> 2:22:03.720
 is perhaps more meticulous than that of any other writer.

2:22:03.720 --> 2:22:07.720
 And it's impossible not to find yourself identifying

2:22:07.720 --> 2:22:12.720
 with Marcel and his obsessive, jealous relationships,

2:22:12.720 --> 2:22:16.720
 particularly with Albertine, it's the simulation.

2:22:16.720 --> 2:22:21.720
 And you decide, I think, as a sentient being,

2:22:21.720 --> 2:22:25.720
 how far to in your own life reenact

2:22:25.720 --> 2:22:29.720
 these more profound experiences

2:22:29.720 --> 2:22:30.720
 that others have written down.

2:22:30.720 --> 2:22:33.720
 One of my earliest literary simulations

2:22:33.720 --> 2:22:36.720
 was to reenact Jack Kerak's trip in On the Road

2:22:36.720 --> 2:22:39.720
 when I was 17, culminating in getting very wasted

2:22:39.720 --> 2:22:43.720
 in the hanging gardens of Zochimilco, not to be missed.

2:22:43.720 --> 2:22:47.720
 And it hit me just as I was reading Proust.

2:22:47.720 --> 2:22:49.720
 That's really how to live a rich life,

2:22:49.720 --> 2:22:52.720
 that one lives life, but one lives it,

2:22:52.720 --> 2:22:54.720
 juxtaposing one's own experience

2:22:54.720 --> 2:22:58.720
 against the more refined experiences of the great writers.

2:22:58.720 --> 2:23:02.720
 So it gives me hope that my children do that a bit.

2:23:02.720 --> 2:23:08.720
 Do you include the Russian authors in the canon?

2:23:08.720 --> 2:23:10.720
 Yes, I don't read Russian,

2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:14.720
 but I was entirely obsessed with Russian literature

2:23:14.720 --> 2:23:15.720
 as a schoolboy.

2:23:15.720 --> 2:23:20.720
 I read my way through Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev,

2:23:20.720 --> 2:23:24.720
 I check off.

2:23:24.720 --> 2:23:30.720
 I think of all of those writers, Tolstoy had the biggest impact,

2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:32.720
 because at the end of War and Peace,

2:23:32.720 --> 2:23:35.720
 there's this great essay on historical determinism,

2:23:35.720 --> 2:23:39.720
 which I think was the reason I became a historian.

2:23:39.720 --> 2:23:46.720
 But I'm really temperamentally a kind of Turgenev person,

2:23:46.720 --> 2:23:47.720
 oddly enough.

2:23:47.720 --> 2:23:50.720
 I think if you haven't read those novelists,

2:23:50.720 --> 2:23:53.720
 I mean, you can't really be a complete human being

2:23:53.720 --> 2:23:57.720
 if you haven't read the Brothers Karamazov.

2:23:57.720 --> 2:24:00.720
 You're not really, you're not grown up.

2:24:00.720 --> 2:24:05.720
 And so I think in many ways those are the greatest novels.

2:24:05.720 --> 2:24:08.720
 Raskolnikov's, remember Raskolnikov's nightmare

2:24:08.720 --> 2:24:11.720
 at the end of Crime and Punishment,

2:24:11.720 --> 2:24:14.720
 in which he imagines, in his dream,

2:24:14.720 --> 2:24:18.720
 a world in which a terrible virus spreads.

2:24:18.720 --> 2:24:19.720
 Do you remember this?

2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:23.720
 And this virus has the effect of making every individual think

2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:26.720
 that what he believes is right.

2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:32.720
 And in this self righteousness,

2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:36.720
 people fall on one another and commit appalling violence.

2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:37.720
 That's Raskolnikov's nightmare.

2:24:37.720 --> 2:24:38.720
 And it's a prophecy.

2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:43.720
 It's a terrible prophecy of Russia's future.

2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:46.720
 Yeah, it's, in coupled with that,

2:24:46.720 --> 2:24:48.720
 it's probably the, I also like the French,

2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:50.720
 the existentialist, all that.

2:24:50.720 --> 2:24:53.720
 The full spectrum in German's Harmon Hessen

2:24:53.720 --> 2:24:56.720
 and just that range of human thought

2:24:56.720 --> 2:24:58.720
 has expressed the literature is fascinating.

2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:03.720
 I really love your idea that the simulation,

2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:07.720
 like one way to live life

2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:11.720
 is to kind of explore these other worlds

2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:14.720
 and borrow from them wisdom

2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:17.720
 that you then just map onto your own life.

2:25:17.720 --> 2:25:19.720
 You're almost like stitched together your life

2:25:19.720 --> 2:25:21.720
 with these kind of pieces from literature.

2:25:21.720 --> 2:25:27.720
 The highly educated person is constantly struck by illusion.

2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:31.720
 Everything is an illusion to something that one has read.

2:25:31.720 --> 2:25:34.720
 And that is the simulation.

2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:37.720
 That's what the real metaverse is.

2:25:37.720 --> 2:25:42.720
 It's the imaginary world that we enter when we read, empathize,

2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:45.720
 and then recognize in our daily lives

2:25:45.720 --> 2:25:50.720
 some scrap of the shared experience that literature gives us.

2:25:50.720 --> 2:25:53.720
 Yeah, I think I've aspired to be the idiot

2:25:53.720 --> 2:25:56.720
 from Prince Mishkin from Dostoyevsky.

2:25:56.720 --> 2:25:59.720
 And in aspiring to be that,

2:25:59.720 --> 2:26:06.720
 I have become the idiot, I feel, at least in part.

2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:09.720
 What, you mentioned the human condition,

2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:12.720
 does love have to do?

2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:15.720
 What role does it play in the human condition?

2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:20.720
 Friendship, love.

2:26:20.720 --> 2:26:26.720
 Love is the drug.

2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:32.720
 Love is, this was the great Roxy Music line

2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:34.720
 that Brian Ferry wrote.

2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:40.720
 Love is the most powerful and dangerous of all the drugs.

2:26:40.720 --> 2:26:49.720
 The driving force that overrides our reason.

2:26:49.720 --> 2:26:54.720
 And of course, it is the primal.

2:26:54.720 --> 2:26:56.720
 It's the primal urge.

2:26:56.720 --> 2:27:00.720
 So what a civilized society has to do

2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:07.720
 is to prevent that drug, that primal force from creating mayhem.

2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:11.720
 So there have to be rules like monogamy

2:27:11.720 --> 2:27:16.720
 and rituals like marriage that reign love in

2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:24.720
 and make the addict at least more or less under control.

2:27:24.720 --> 2:27:30.720
 I think that's part of why I'm a romantic

2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:35.720
 rather than a Steve Penker Enlightenment rationalist

2:27:35.720 --> 2:27:41.720
 because the romantics realize that love was the drug.

2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:45.720
 It's like the difference in sensibility

2:27:45.720 --> 2:27:49.720
 between Handel and Wagner.

2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:52.720
 And I had a Wagnerian phase when I was an undergraduate.

2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:59.720
 I still remember thinking that as old as Liebes told

2:27:59.720 --> 2:28:02.720
 that Wagner had got the closest to sex

2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:08.720
 that anybody had ever got in music or perhaps to love.

2:28:08.720 --> 2:28:11.720
 I'm lucky that I love my wife

2:28:11.720 --> 2:28:21.720
 and that we were, by the time we met, smart enough to understand

2:28:21.720 --> 2:28:25.720
 that love is a drug that you have to kind of take

2:28:25.720 --> 2:28:29.720
 in certain careful ways.

2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:36.720
 And that it works best in the context of a stable family.

2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:38.720
 That's the key thing.

2:28:38.720 --> 2:28:40.720
 That one has to sort of take the drug

2:28:40.720 --> 2:28:47.720
 and then submit to the conventions of marriage and family life.

2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:55.720
 I think in that respect, I'm a kind of tamed romantic.

2:28:55.720 --> 2:28:57.720
 That's how I'd like to think about it.

2:28:57.720 --> 2:29:00.720
 And the degree to which your romanticism is tamed

2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:03.720
 can be then channeled into productive work.

2:29:03.720 --> 2:29:05.720
 That's why you're a historian and a writer.

2:29:05.720 --> 2:29:07.720
 The rest of that love is channeled through the writing.

2:29:07.720 --> 2:29:09.720
 So, if you're going to be addicted to anything,

2:29:09.720 --> 2:29:11.720
 be addicted to work.

2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:13.720
 I mean, we're all addictive,

2:29:13.720 --> 2:29:15.720
 but the thing about workaholism

2:29:15.720 --> 2:29:18.720
 is that it is the most productive addiction

2:29:18.720 --> 2:29:22.720
 and rather that than drugs or booze.

2:29:22.720 --> 2:29:28.720
 So, yes, I'm always trying to channel my anxieties into work.

2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:31.720
 I learned that at a relatively early age,

2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:36.720
 it's a sort of massively productive way of coping with the inner demons.

2:29:36.720 --> 2:29:39.720
 And again, we should teach kids that

2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:43.720
 because let's come back to our earlier conversation about universities.

2:29:43.720 --> 2:29:46.720
 Part of what happens at university is that adolescents

2:29:46.720 --> 2:29:49.720
 have to overcome all the inner demons.

2:29:49.720 --> 2:29:52.720
 And these include deep insecurity

2:29:52.720 --> 2:29:55.720
 about one's appearance, about one's intellect,

2:29:55.720 --> 2:29:59.720
 and then madly raging hormones that cause you to behave

2:29:59.720 --> 2:30:03.720
 like a complete fool with the people to whom you're sexually attracted.

2:30:03.720 --> 2:30:05.720
 All of this is going on in the university.

2:30:05.720 --> 2:30:07.720
 How can it be a safe space?

2:30:07.720 --> 2:30:11.720
 It's a completely dangerous space, by definition.

2:30:11.720 --> 2:30:16.720
 So, yeah, teaching young people how to manage these storms,

2:30:16.720 --> 2:30:20.720
 that's part of the job and we're really not allowed to do that anymore

2:30:20.720 --> 2:30:22.720
 because we can't talk about these things for fear of the title

2:30:22.720 --> 2:30:26.720
 and iron offices kicking down the door and dragging us off in chains.

2:30:26.720 --> 2:30:31.720
 And like you said, hard work and something you call work ethic

2:30:31.720 --> 2:30:38.720
 in civilization is a pretty effective way to achieve,

2:30:38.720 --> 2:30:41.720
 I think, a kind of happiness in a world that's full of anxiety.

2:30:41.720 --> 2:30:43.720
 Or at least exhaustion.

2:30:43.720 --> 2:30:48.720
 Well, there is beauty to the exhaustion.

2:30:48.720 --> 2:30:54.720
 There's why running this manual work that some part of us has built for that.

2:30:54.720 --> 2:30:55.720
 Right.

2:30:55.720 --> 2:30:59.720
 I mean, we are products of evolution

2:30:59.720 --> 2:31:04.720
 and our adaptation to a technological world is a very imperfect one.

2:31:04.720 --> 2:31:10.720
 So, hence the kind of masochistic urge to run.

2:31:10.720 --> 2:31:13.720
 I'd like outdoor exercise.

2:31:13.720 --> 2:31:15.720
 I don't really like gyms.

2:31:15.720 --> 2:31:21.720
 So, I'll go for long punishing runs in woodland,

2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:23.720
 hike up hills.

2:31:23.720 --> 2:31:27.720
 I like swimming in lakes and in the sea

2:31:27.720 --> 2:31:32.720
 because that just has to be that physical activity

2:31:32.720 --> 2:31:34.720
 in order to do the good mental work.

2:31:34.720 --> 2:31:39.720
 And so, it's all about trying to do the best work.

2:31:39.720 --> 2:31:45.720
 That's my sense that we have some random allocation of talent.

2:31:45.720 --> 2:31:48.720
 You kind of figure out what it is that you're relatively good at

2:31:48.720 --> 2:31:51.720
 and you try to do that well.

2:31:51.720 --> 2:31:54.720
 I think my father encouraged me to think that way.

2:31:54.720 --> 2:31:58.720
 And you don't mind about being average at the other stuff.

2:31:58.720 --> 2:32:02.720
 The kind of sick thing is to try to be brilliant at everything, I hate those people.

2:32:02.720 --> 2:32:07.720
 You should really not worry too much if you're just an average double bass player,

2:32:07.720 --> 2:32:11.720
 which I am, or kind of average skier, which I definitely am.

2:32:11.720 --> 2:32:17.720
 Doing those things okay is part of leading a rich and fulfilling life.

2:32:17.720 --> 2:32:22.720
 I was not a good actor, but I got a lot out of acting as an undergraduate.

2:32:22.720 --> 2:32:28.720
 I turned out after three years of experimentation at Oxford that I was broadly speaking better

2:32:28.720 --> 2:32:32.720
 at writing history essays than my peers.

2:32:32.720 --> 2:32:34.720
 And that was my edge.

2:32:34.720 --> 2:32:36.720
 That was my comparative advantage.

2:32:36.720 --> 2:32:40.720
 And so, I've just tried to make a living from that slight edge.

2:32:40.720 --> 2:32:44.720
 Yeah, that's a beautiful way to describe a life.

2:32:44.720 --> 2:32:46.720
 Is there a meaning to this thing?

2:32:46.720 --> 2:32:48.720
 Is there a meaning to life?

2:32:48.720 --> 2:32:50.720
 What is the meaning of life?

2:32:50.720 --> 2:32:56.720
 By a physicist and a physician, they were more or less committed atheists

2:32:56.720 --> 2:33:02.720
 who had left the Church of Scotland as a protest against sectarianism in Glasgow.

2:33:02.720 --> 2:33:08.720
 And so, my sister and I were told from an early age life was a cosmic accident.

2:33:08.720 --> 2:33:11.720
 And that was it.

2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:16.720
 There was no great meaning to it.

2:33:16.720 --> 2:33:19.720
 And I can't really get past that.

2:33:19.720 --> 2:33:23.720
 Isn't there beauty to being an accident at a cosmic scale?

2:33:23.720 --> 2:33:27.720
 Yes, I wasn't taught to feel negative about that.

2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:35.720
 And if anything, it was a frivolous insight that the whole thing was a kind of joke.

2:33:35.720 --> 2:33:41.720
 And I think that atheism isn't really a basis for ordering a society,

2:33:41.720 --> 2:33:46.720
 but it's been all right for me.

2:33:46.720 --> 2:33:52.720
 I don't have a kind of sense of a missing religious faith.

2:33:52.720 --> 2:34:03.720
 For me, however, there's clearly some embedded Christian ethics in the way my parents lived.

2:34:03.720 --> 2:34:10.720
 And so, we were kind of atheist Calvinists who had kind of deposed God

2:34:10.720 --> 2:34:14.720
 but carried on behaving as if we were members of the elect in a moral universe.

2:34:14.720 --> 2:34:20.720
 So, that's kind of the state of mind that I was left in.

2:34:20.720 --> 2:34:32.720
 And I think that we aren't really around long enough to claim that our individual lives have meaning.

2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:35.720
 But what Edmund Burke said is true.

2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:40.720
 The real social contract is between the generations, between the dead, the living and the unborn.

2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:47.720
 And the meaning of life is, for me at least, to live in a way that honors the dead,

2:34:47.720 --> 2:34:51.720
 seeks to learn from their accumulated wisdom because they do still outnumber us.

2:34:51.720 --> 2:34:55.720
 They outnumber the living by quite a significant margin.

2:34:55.720 --> 2:35:02.720
 And then, to be mindful of the unborn and our responsibility to them,

2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:06.720
 writing books is a way of communicating with the unborn.

2:35:06.720 --> 2:35:13.720
 It may or may not succeed and probably won't succeed if my books are never assigned by work professors in the future.

2:35:13.720 --> 2:35:17.720
 So, what we have to do is more than just write books and record podcasts.

2:35:17.720 --> 2:35:19.720
 There have to be institutions.

2:35:19.720 --> 2:35:21.720
 I'm 57 now.

2:35:21.720 --> 2:35:28.720
 I realized recently that succession planning had to be the main focus of the next 20 years

2:35:28.720 --> 2:35:35.720
 because there are things that I really care about that I want future generations to have access to.

2:35:35.720 --> 2:35:43.720
 And so, the meaning of life, I do regard as being intergenerational transfer of wisdom.

2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:48.720
 Ultimately, the species will go extinct at some point.

2:35:48.720 --> 2:35:55.720
 Even if we do colonize Mars, one senses that physics will catch up with this particular organism,

2:35:55.720 --> 2:35:58.720
 but it's in the pretty far distant future.

2:35:58.720 --> 2:36:03.720
 And so, the meaning of life is to make sure that for as long as there are human beings,

2:36:03.720 --> 2:36:15.720
 they are able to live the kind of fulfilled lives, ethically fulfilled, intellectually fulfilled, emotionally fulfilled lives,

2:36:15.720 --> 2:36:18.720
 that civilization has made possible.

2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:23.720
 It would be easy for us to revert to the uncivilized world.

2:36:23.720 --> 2:36:29.720
 There's a fantastic book that I'm going to misremember.

2:36:29.720 --> 2:36:37.720
 Milos is the captive mind, rather, which has a fantastic passage.

2:36:37.720 --> 2:36:42.720
 He was a Polish intellectual who says,

2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:48.720
 Americans can never imagine what it's like for civilization to be completely destroyed,

2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:53.720
 as it was in Poland by the end of World War II, to have no rule of law,

2:36:53.720 --> 2:36:57.720
 to have no security of even person, never mind property rights.

2:36:57.720 --> 2:37:02.720
 They can't imagine what that's like and what it will lead you to do.

2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:15.720
 So, one reason for teaching history is to remind the lucky Generation Z members of California that civilization is a thin film,

2:37:15.720 --> 2:37:18.720
 and it can be destroyed remarkably easily.

2:37:18.720 --> 2:37:23.720
 And to preserve civilization is a tremendous responsibility that we have.

2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:25.720
 It's a huge responsibility.

2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:30.720
 And we must not destroy ourselves, whether it's in the name of wokeism

2:37:30.720 --> 2:37:33.720
 or the pursuit of the metaverse.

2:37:33.720 --> 2:37:36.720
 Preserving civilization and making it available, not just to our kids,

2:37:36.720 --> 2:37:42.720
 but to people we'll never know, generations ahead, that's the meaning.

2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:46.720
 And do so by studying the lessons of history.

2:37:46.720 --> 2:37:47.720
 Right.

2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:50.720
 Not only studying them, but then acting on them.

2:37:50.720 --> 2:37:54.720
 For me, the biggest problem is how do we apply history more effectively?

2:37:54.720 --> 2:38:00.720
 It seems as if our institutions, including government, are very, very bad at applying history.

2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:03.720
 Lessons of history are learned poorly, if at all.

2:38:03.720 --> 2:38:05.720
 Analogies are drawn crudely.

2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:07.720
 Often the wrong inferences are drawn.

2:38:07.720 --> 2:38:13.720
 One of the big intellectual challenges for me is how to make history more useful.

2:38:13.720 --> 2:38:18.720
 And this was the kind of thing that professors used to hate, but really practically useful,

2:38:18.720 --> 2:38:28.720
 so that policymakers and citizens can think about the decisions that they face with a more historically informed body of knowledge,

2:38:28.720 --> 2:38:33.720
 whether it's a pandemic, the challenge of climate change, what to do about Taiwan.

2:38:33.720 --> 2:38:40.720
 I can't think of a better set of things to know before you make decisions about those things

2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:43.720
 than the things that history has to offer.

2:38:43.720 --> 2:38:45.720
 Well, I love the discipline of applied history.

2:38:45.720 --> 2:38:53.720
 Basically going to history and saying, what are the key principles here that are applicable to the problems of today?

2:38:53.720 --> 2:38:54.720
 Right.

2:38:54.720 --> 2:38:55.720
 And how can we solve that?

2:38:55.720 --> 2:39:02.720
 The great philosopher of history, R.G. Collingwood, said in his autobiography, which was published in 1939,

2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:11.720
 that the purpose of history was to reconstitute past thought from whatever surviving remnants there were,

2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:15.720
 and then to juxtapose it with our own predicament.

2:39:15.720 --> 2:39:20.720
 And that's that juxtaposition of past experience with present experience that is so important.

2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:22.720
 We don't do that well.

2:39:22.720 --> 2:39:32.720
 And indeed, we've flipped it so that academic historians now think their mission is to travel back to the past with the value system of 2021

2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:39.720
 and castigate the dead for their racism and sexism and transphobia and whatnot.

2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:41.720
 And that's exactly wrong.

2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:45.720
 Our mission is to go back and try to understand what it was like to live in the 18th century,

2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:50.720
 not to go back and condescend to the people of the past.

2:39:50.720 --> 2:39:54.720
 And once we've had a better understanding, once we've seen into their lives, read their words,

2:39:54.720 --> 2:39:59.720
 tried to reconstitute their experience to come back and understand our own time better,

2:39:59.720 --> 2:40:01.720
 that's what we should really be doing.

2:40:01.720 --> 2:40:06.720
 But academic history has gone completely haywire and it does almost the exact opposite of what I think it should do.

2:40:06.720 --> 2:40:13.720
 And by studying history, walk beautifully, gracefully through this simulation, as you described,

2:40:13.720 --> 2:40:16.720
 by mapping the lessons of history into the world of today.

2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:19.720
 We have virtual reality already in our heads.

2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:23.720
 We do not need Oculus and the Metaverse.

2:40:23.720 --> 2:40:28.720
 This was an incredible, hopeful conversation in many ways that did not expect.

2:40:28.720 --> 2:40:34.720
 I thought our conversation would be much more about history than about the future and it turned out to be the opposite.

2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:38.720
 Thank you so much for talking today. It's a huge honor to finally meet you, to talk to you.

2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:40.720
 Thank you for your valuable time.

2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:42.720
 Thank you, Lex, and good luck with Putin.

2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:46.720
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Neil Ferguson.

2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:50.720
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:40:50.720 --> 2:40:54.720
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Neil Ferguson himself.

2:40:54.720 --> 2:41:00.720
 No civilization, no matter how mighty it may appear to itself, is indestructible.

2:41:00.720 --> 2:41:04.720
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
