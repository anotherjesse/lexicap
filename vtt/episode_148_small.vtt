00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
 The following is a conversation with Charles Isbell and Michael Litman.

00:03.760 --> 00:07.200
 Charles is the Dean of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech,

00:07.200 --> 00:10.720
 and Michael is a computer science professor at Brown University.

00:10.720 --> 00:14.800
 I've spoken with each of them individually on this podcast,

00:14.800 --> 00:18.960
 and since they are good friends in real life, we all thought it would be fun

00:18.960 --> 00:23.280
 to have a conversation together. Quick mention of each sponsor,

00:23.280 --> 00:26.960
 followed by some thoughts related to the episode. Thank you to

00:26.960 --> 00:31.520

00:31.520 --> 00:36.000
 nutritional bases. AteSleep, a mattress that cools itself and

00:36.000 --> 00:39.760

00:50.800 --> 00:54.800
 and to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that

00:54.800 --> 00:58.880
 having two guests on the podcast is an experiment that I've been meaning to do

00:58.880 --> 01:02.560
 for a while. In particular, because down the road I

01:02.560 --> 01:06.640
 would like to occasionally be a kind of moderator for debates

01:06.640 --> 01:10.480
 between people that may disagree in some interesting ways.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.880
 If you have suggestions for who you would like to see debate on this podcast,

01:14.880 --> 01:18.480
 let me know. As with all experiments of this kind,

01:18.480 --> 01:22.560
 it is a learning process. Both the video and the audio might need

01:22.560 --> 01:25.760
 improvement. I realized I think I should probably do

01:25.760 --> 01:28.800
 three or more cameras next time as opposed to just two

01:28.800 --> 01:33.040
 and also try different ways to mount the microphone for the

01:33.040 --> 01:36.720
 third person. Also, after recording this intro,

01:36.720 --> 01:41.120
 I'm going to have to go figure out the thumbnail for the video version of the

01:41.120 --> 01:45.600
 podcast since I usually put the guest's head on the thumbnail

01:45.600 --> 01:49.600
 and now there's two heads and two names

01:49.600 --> 01:53.520
 to try to fit into the thumbnail. It's a kind of

01:53.520 --> 01:58.320
 bin packing problem, which in theoretical computer science

01:58.320 --> 02:03.920
 happens to be an NP hard problem. Whatever I come up with, if you have

02:03.920 --> 02:06.560
 better ideas for the thumbnail, let me know as well.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.240
 And in general, I always welcome ideas how this thing can be improved.

02:10.240 --> 02:14.000

02:20.960 --> 02:24.720
 And now here's my conversation with Charles Isbell

02:24.720 --> 02:28.480
 and Michael Litman. You'll probably disagree

02:28.480 --> 02:33.440
 about this question, but what is your biggest, would you say, disagreement

02:33.440 --> 02:38.640
 about either something profound and very important or something completely not

02:38.640 --> 02:41.840
 important at all? I don't think you have any disagreements at all.

02:41.840 --> 02:45.600
 I'm not sure that's true. We walked into that one, didn't we?

02:45.600 --> 02:50.240
 So one thing that you sometimes mention is that, and we did this one on

02:50.240 --> 02:53.920
 air too, as it were, whether or not machine learning is

02:53.920 --> 02:57.680
 computational statistics. It's not. But it is.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.400
 Well, it's not. And in particular, and more importantly,

03:00.400 --> 03:04.320
 it is not just computational statistics. So what's missing in the picture?

03:04.320 --> 03:08.400
 All the rest of it. What's missing? That which is missing.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.440
 Oh, you can't be wrong now. Well, it's not just the statistics.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.160
 He doesn't even believe this. We've had this conversation before.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.640
 If it were just the statistics, then we would be happy with where we are.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.960
 But it's not just the statistics. That's why it's computational

03:20.960 --> 03:22.560
 statistics. Or if it were just the computational.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.560
 I agree that machine learning is not just statistics.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.320
 It is not just the statistics. We can agree on that.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.200
 Nor is it just computational statistics. It's computational statistics.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.360
 It is computational. What is the computational and

03:31.360 --> 03:35.040
 computational statistics? Does this take us into the realm of computing?

03:35.040 --> 03:40.240
 It does, but I think perhaps the way I can get him to admit that he's wrong

03:40.240 --> 03:44.000
 is that it's about rules. It's about rules.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.760
 It's about symbols. It's about all these other things.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.720
 But the statistics is not about rules? I'm going to say statistics is about rules.

03:48.720 --> 03:51.440
 But it's not just the statistics, right? It's not just a random variable that you

03:51.440 --> 03:54.400
 choose and you have a probability. I think you have a narrow view of statistics.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.760
 Okay. Well, then what would be the broad view of statistics that would still allow it to be

03:57.760 --> 04:02.880
 statistics and not say history that would make computational statistics okay?

04:02.880 --> 04:08.320
 Well, okay. So I had my first sort of research mentor, a guy named Tom Landauer,

04:08.320 --> 04:15.120
 who taught me to do some statistics, right? And I was annoyed all the time because the

04:15.120 --> 04:18.480
 statistics would say that what I was doing was not statistically significant.

04:19.120 --> 04:23.600
 And I was like, but, and basically what he said to me is,

04:23.600 --> 04:26.080
 statistics is how you're going to keep from lying to yourself,

04:27.520 --> 04:32.240
 which I thought was really deep. It is a way to keep yourself honest in a

04:32.240 --> 04:35.680
 particular way. I agree with that. Yeah. And so you're trying to find rules.

04:35.680 --> 04:41.760
 I'm just going to bring it back to rules. Wait, wait, wait. Could you possibly try to

04:41.760 --> 04:48.320
 define rules? Even regular statisticians, non computational statisticians, do spend some

04:48.320 --> 04:52.640
 of their time evaluating rules, right? Applying statistics to try to understand,

04:52.640 --> 04:55.520
 is this, you know, is this, does this rule capture this? Does this not capture that?

04:55.520 --> 04:59.280
 You mean like hypothesis testing kind of thing? Sure. Or like confidence intervals?

04:59.280 --> 05:02.480
 Like, like, I think more like hypothesis. Like I feel like the word

05:02.480 --> 05:06.560
 statistic literally means like a summary, like a number that summarizes other numbers.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.960
 Right. But I think the field of statistics actually applies that idea to, to things like

05:10.960 --> 05:16.560
 rules to understand whether or not a rule is valid. So software engineering statistics?

05:18.080 --> 05:23.040
 No. Programming languages statistics? No. Because I think there's a very, it's useful

05:23.040 --> 05:26.960
 to think about a lot of what AI and machine learning is or certain it should be as software

05:26.960 --> 05:32.720
 engineering as programming languages. Just if to put it in language that you might understand,

05:33.280 --> 05:36.880
 the hyperparameters beyond the problem. The hyperparameters is too many syllables

05:36.880 --> 05:40.080
 for me to understand. The hyperparameters. That's better.

05:40.080 --> 05:44.480
 That goes around it, right? It's the decisions you choose to make. It's the metrics you choose to

05:44.480 --> 05:48.560
 use. It's the loss function. You want to say the practice of machine learning is different

05:48.560 --> 05:52.320
 than the practice of statistics. Like the things you have to worry about and how you worry about

05:52.320 --> 05:57.760
 them are different. Therefore, they're different. Right. At a very little, at the very least,

05:57.760 --> 06:01.440
 it's that much is true. It doesn't mean that statistics computational or otherwise aren't

06:01.440 --> 06:06.640
 important. I think they are. I mean, I do a lot of that, for example. But I think it goes beyond

06:06.640 --> 06:10.480
 that. I think that we could think about game theory in terms of statistics, but I don't think

06:10.480 --> 06:15.200
 it's very as useful to do. I mean, the way I would think about it or a way I would think about it

06:15.200 --> 06:22.080
 is this way. Chemistry is just physics. But I don't think it's as useful to think about chemistry

06:22.080 --> 06:26.240
 as being just physics. It's useful to think about it as chemistry. The level of abstraction

06:26.240 --> 06:30.960
 really matters here. So I think there are contexts in which it is useful. I think it's that way,

06:30.960 --> 06:34.640
 right? So finding that connection is actually helpful. And I think that's when I emphasize

06:34.640 --> 06:41.680
 the computational statistics thing. I think I want to befriend statistics and not absorb them.

06:41.680 --> 06:47.040
 Here's the a way to think about it beyond what I just said. So what would you say,

06:47.040 --> 06:49.920
 and I want you to think back to a conversation I had a very long time ago, what would you say

06:49.920 --> 06:57.120
 is the difference between, say, the early 2000s, ICML and what we used to call NIPS, NURPS. Is

06:57.120 --> 07:00.800
 there a difference? A lot of it, particularly on the machine learning that was done there?

07:00.800 --> 07:05.600
 ICML was around that long. Oh, yeah. So I clear as the new conference, newish.

07:06.720 --> 07:13.280
 Yeah, I guess so. And ICML was around the 2000. Oh, ICML predates that. I think my most cited

07:13.280 --> 07:17.360
 ICML papers from 94. Michael knows this better than me because, of course, he's significantly

07:17.360 --> 07:23.120
 older than I am. But the point is, what is the difference between ICML and NURPS in the late

07:23.120 --> 07:27.440
 90s, early 2000s? I don't know what everyone else's perspective would be, but I had a particular

07:27.440 --> 07:34.400
 perspective at that time, which is I felt like ICML was more of a computer science place and that

07:34.400 --> 07:39.360
 NURPS, NURPS was more of an engineering place, like the kind of math that happened at the two

07:39.360 --> 07:45.520
 places. As a computer scientist, I felt more comfortable with the ICML math. And the NURPS

07:45.520 --> 07:50.720
 people would say that that's because I'm dumb. And that's such an engineering thing to say.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.560
 I agree with that part of it, but I do a little differently. I actually had a nice conversation

07:54.560 --> 07:59.360
 with Tom Dietrich about this on Twitter just a couple days ago. I put it a little differently,

07:59.360 --> 08:07.360
 which is that ICML was machine learning done by computer scientists. And NURPS was machine

08:07.360 --> 08:13.600
 learning done by computer scientists trying to impress statisticians, which was weird because

08:13.600 --> 08:18.240
 it was the same people, at least by the time I started paying attention. But it just felt very,

08:18.240 --> 08:22.640
 very different. And I think that that perspective of whether you're trying to impress the statisticians

08:22.640 --> 08:26.720
 or you're trying to impress the programmers is actually very different and has real impact on

08:28.080 --> 08:32.240
 what you choose to worry about and what kind of outcomes you come to. So I think it really

08:32.240 --> 08:36.960
 matters. I think computer statistics is a means to an end. It is not an end in some sense. And I

08:36.960 --> 08:40.960
 think that really matters here in the same way that I don't think computer science is just

08:40.960 --> 08:45.360
 engineering or just science or just math or whatever. Okay. So I'd have to now agree that now we

08:45.360 --> 08:51.600
 agree on everything. Yes. Yes. The important thing here is that my opinions may have changed,

08:51.600 --> 08:55.520
 but not the fact that I'm right, I think is what we just came to. Right. And my opinions may have

08:55.520 --> 09:01.360
 changed and not the fact that I'm wrong. That's right. I've lost me. I think I lost myself there

09:01.360 --> 09:06.720
 too. But anyway, we're back. We're back. This happens sometimes. We're sorry. How does neural

09:06.720 --> 09:14.080
 networks change this? Just leave and linger on this topic, change this idea of statistics,

09:15.520 --> 09:20.240
 how big of a pie statistics is within the machine learning thing? Like, because it sounds like

09:20.240 --> 09:25.840
 hyperparameters and also just the role of data. You know, this people are starting to use the

09:25.840 --> 09:35.600
 terminology of software 2.0, which is like the act of programming as a, as a, like you're a designer

09:35.600 --> 09:40.720
 in the hyperparameter space of neural networks, and you're also the collector and the organizer and

09:40.720 --> 09:50.240
 the cleaner of the data. And that's part of the programming. So how did, on the NeurIPS versus

09:50.240 --> 09:56.640
 ICML topic, what's the role of neural networks in redefining the size and the role of machine

09:56.640 --> 10:01.360
 learning? I can't wait to hear what Michael thinks about this, but I would add one. But you will.

10:01.360 --> 10:06.640
 But that's true. I will force myself to. I think the, the, there's one other thing I would add to

10:06.640 --> 10:10.000
 your description, which is the kind of software engineering part is what does it mean to debug,

10:10.000 --> 10:14.800
 for example. But this is a difference between the kind of computational statistics view of

10:14.800 --> 10:19.200
 machine learning and the computational view of machine learning, which is, I think one is worried

10:19.200 --> 10:23.600
 about the equation as it were. And by the way, this is not a value judgment. I just think it's

10:23.600 --> 10:27.200
 about perspective. But the kind of questions you would ask, we start asking yourself, well,

10:27.200 --> 10:30.720
 what does it mean to program and develop and build the system is a very computer

10:30.720 --> 10:36.960
 sciencey view of the problem. I mean, when, if you get on data science Twitter and econ Twitter,

10:36.960 --> 10:43.360
 you actually hear this a lot with the, you know, the economist and the data scientist complaining

10:43.360 --> 10:46.800
 about the machine learning people was, you know, it's just statistics. And I don't know why they

10:46.800 --> 10:50.640
 don't don't see this, but they're not even asking the same questions. They're not thinking about it

10:50.640 --> 10:55.760
 as a kind of programming problem. And I think that that really matters just asking this question.

10:55.760 --> 11:00.960
 I actually think it's a little different from programming and hyperparameters space and sort

11:00.960 --> 11:07.120
 of collecting the data. But I do think that that immersion really matters. So I'll give you a quick,

11:07.120 --> 11:10.480
 a quick example of the way I think about this. So I teach machine learning, Michael and I have

11:10.480 --> 11:14.720
 co taught a machine learning class, which has now reached, I don't know, 10,000 people at least

11:14.720 --> 11:20.400
 over the last several years, or somewhere there's abouts. And my machine learning assignments are

11:20.400 --> 11:25.040
 of this form. So the super the first one is something like implement these five algorithms,

11:25.040 --> 11:31.040
 you know, K and N and S, you know, SVMs and boosting and decision trees and neural networks.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.800
 And maybe that's it. I can't remember. And when I say implement, I mean, steal the code. I'm

11:34.800 --> 11:39.120
 completely uninterested. You get zero points for getting the thing to work. And I want you

11:39.120 --> 11:44.160
 spending your time worrying about getting the corner case right of, you know, what happens

11:44.160 --> 11:48.080
 when you are trying to normalize distances and the points on the thing. And so you divide by

11:48.080 --> 11:53.280
 zero. I'm not interested in that, right? Steal the code. However, you're going to run those

11:53.280 --> 11:58.720
 algorithms on two data sets. The data sets have to be interesting. What does it mean to be interesting?

11:58.720 --> 12:02.640
 Well, data sets interesting if it reveals differences between algorithms, which presumably

12:02.640 --> 12:06.800
 are all the same, because they can represent whatever they can represent. And two data sets

12:06.800 --> 12:11.600
 are interesting together if they show different differences as it were. And you have to analyze

12:11.600 --> 12:14.400
 them. You have to justify their interestingness and you have to analyze them in a whole bunch of

12:14.400 --> 12:19.360
 ways. But all I care about is the data in your analysis, not the programming. And I occasionally

12:19.360 --> 12:23.920
 end up in these long discussions with students. Well, I don't really, I copy and paste the things

12:23.920 --> 12:28.000
 that I've said the other 15,000 times it's come up, which is, they go, but the only way to learn

12:28.960 --> 12:34.640
 really understand is to code them up, which is a very programmer software engineering view

12:34.640 --> 12:37.920
 of the world. If you don't program it, you don't understand it, which is, by the way,

12:37.920 --> 12:43.120
 I think is wrong in a very specific way. But it is a way that you come to understand because then

12:43.120 --> 12:46.800
 you have to wrestle with the algorithm. But the thing about machine learning is not just sorting

12:46.800 --> 12:50.640
 numbers. Where in some sense, the data doesn't matter. What matters is, well, does the algorithm

12:50.640 --> 12:54.560
 work on these abstract things, one to less than the other. In machine learning, the data matters.

12:54.560 --> 13:00.480
 It matters more than almost anything. And not everything, but almost anything. And so as a

13:00.480 --> 13:05.120
 result, you have to live with the data and don't get distracted by the algorithm per se. And I

13:05.120 --> 13:11.120
 think that that focus on the data and what it can tell you and what question it's actually answering

13:11.120 --> 13:15.360
 for you, as opposed to the question you thought you were asking, is a key and important thing

13:15.360 --> 13:20.080
 about machine learning and is a way that computationalists, as opposed to statisticians,

13:20.080 --> 13:24.960
 bring a particular view about how to think about the process. The statisticians, by contrast,

13:24.960 --> 13:31.120
 bring, I think I'd be willing to say, a better view about the kind of formal math that's behind

13:31.120 --> 13:36.880
 it and what an actual number ultimately is saying about the data. And those are both important,

13:36.880 --> 13:42.320
 but they're also different. I didn't really think of it this way is to build intuition about

13:42.320 --> 13:47.360
 the role of data, the different characteristics of data by having two data sets that are different

13:47.360 --> 13:51.360
 and they reveal the differences and the differences. That's a really fascinating,

13:51.360 --> 13:56.240
 that's a really interesting educational approach. The students love it, but not right away.

13:56.240 --> 14:03.440
 They love it later. They love it at the end. Not at the beginning. Not even immediately after.

14:03.440 --> 14:09.280
 I feel like there's a deep, profound lesson about education there. Yeah. That you can't listen to

14:09.280 --> 14:14.800
 students about whether what you're doing is the right or the wrong thing.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.920
 Well, as a wise, Michael Lippmann once said to me about children, which I think applies to teaching,

14:21.920 --> 14:27.760
 is you have to give them what they need without bending to their will. And students are like

14:27.760 --> 14:30.880
 that. You have to figure out what they need. You're a curator. Your whole job is to curate

14:30.880 --> 14:34.880
 and to present because on their own, they're not going to necessarily know where to search.

14:34.880 --> 14:40.800
 So you're providing pushes in some direction and learn space and you have to give them what they

14:40.800 --> 14:46.720
 need in a way that keeps them engaged enough so that they eventually discover what they want

14:46.720 --> 14:52.720
 and they get the tools they need to go and learn other things. What's your view? Let me put on

14:52.720 --> 14:57.280
 my Russian hat, which believes that life is... I like Russian hats, by the way. If you have one,

14:57.280 --> 15:01.760
 I would like this. Those are ridiculous. Yes. But in a delightful way, but sure.

15:01.760 --> 15:08.880
 What do you think is the role of... We talked about balance a little bit. What do you think is

15:08.880 --> 15:18.000
 the role of hardship in education? I think the biggest things I've learned, what made me fall

15:18.000 --> 15:26.960
 in love with math, for example, is by being bad at it until I got good at it. So struggling with

15:26.960 --> 15:34.560
 a problem, which increased the level of joy I felt when I finally figured it out. It always felt

15:34.560 --> 15:40.800
 with me, with teachers, especially modern discussions of education, how can we make

15:40.800 --> 15:46.240
 education more fun, more engaging, more all those things? Well, from my perspective, it's like

15:46.880 --> 15:54.720
 you may be missing the point that education, that life is suffering. Education is supposed to be hard

15:54.720 --> 15:59.840
 and that actually what increases the joy you feel when you actually learn something. Is that

16:00.480 --> 16:06.560
 ridiculous? Do you like to see your students suffer? Okay. So this may be a point where we differ.

16:07.280 --> 16:12.560
 I suspect not. Let me do go on. Well, what would your answer be? I want to hear you first. Okay. Well,

16:12.560 --> 16:18.000
 I was going to not answer the question. You don't want the students to know you're going to suffer?

16:18.000 --> 16:23.520
 No, no, no. I was going to say that there's... I think there's a distinction that you can make

16:23.520 --> 16:30.160
 in the kind of suffering. So I think you can be in a mode where you're suffering in a hopeless way

16:30.160 --> 16:40.080
 versus you're suffering in a hopeful way, where you're like, you can see that you can still imagine

16:40.080 --> 16:44.880
 getting to the end. And as long as people are in that mindset where they're struggling, but it's

16:44.880 --> 16:50.400
 not a hopeless kind of struggling, that's productive. I think that's really helpful.

16:50.400 --> 16:57.600
 But it's struggling. If you break their will, if you leave them hopeless, no, that don't... Sure,

16:57.600 --> 17:01.760
 some people are going to whatever lift themselves up by their bootstraps, but mostly you give up

17:01.760 --> 17:05.920
 and certainly it takes the joy out of it. And you're not going to spend a lot of time on something

17:05.920 --> 17:11.440
 that brings you no joy. So it is a bit of a delicate balance. You have to thwart people

17:12.160 --> 17:15.840
 in a way that they still believe that there's a way through.

17:15.840 --> 17:21.600
 Right. So that's a... We strongly agree, actually. So I think... Well, first off, struggling and

17:21.600 --> 17:25.120
 suffering aren't the same thing, right? Yeah, it's being poetic.

17:25.120 --> 17:30.240
 Oh, no. I actually appreciate the poetry. And one of the reasons I appreciate it is that they are

17:30.800 --> 17:34.320
 often the same thing and often quite different, right? So you can struggle without suffering.

17:34.320 --> 17:38.640
 You can certainly suffer pretty easily. You don't necessarily have to struggle to suffer.

17:38.640 --> 17:44.400
 So I think that you want people to struggle, but that hope matters. You have to understand

17:44.400 --> 17:48.320
 that they're going to get through it on the other side. And it's very easy to confuse the two.

17:49.840 --> 17:55.200
 I actually think Brown University has a very... Just philosophically has a very different take

17:55.200 --> 17:58.560
 on the relationship with their students, particularly undergrads from, say, a place like

17:58.560 --> 18:03.200
 Georgia Tech, which is... Which university is better? Well, I have my opinions on that.

18:03.200 --> 18:07.280
 I mean, remember, Charles said, it doesn't matter what the facts are, I'm always right.

18:07.280 --> 18:12.720
 The correct answer is that it doesn't matter. They're different. But they're clearly answers.

18:12.720 --> 18:19.280
 He went to a school like the school where he is as an undergrad. I went to a school,

18:19.280 --> 18:23.280
 specifically the same school, though it was changed a bit in the intervening years.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.000
 Brown or Georgia Tech.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.120
 No, I was talking about Georgia Tech.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.080
 Georgia Tech is changed.

18:26.080 --> 18:30.000
 Yeah. And I went to an undergrad place that's a lot like the place where I work now. And so it

18:30.000 --> 18:33.120
 does seem like we're more familiar with these models.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.800
 There's a similarity between Brown and Yale.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.840
 Yeah. I think they're quite similar.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.240
 Yeah.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.040
 And Duke.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.720
 Duke has some similarities too, but it's got a little Southern draw.

18:42.720 --> 18:47.120
 You've kind of worked your... You sort of worked at universities that are like the places where

18:47.120 --> 18:52.000
 you learned. And the same would be true for me.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.640
 Are you uncomfortable venturing outside the box? Is that what you're saying?

18:57.200 --> 18:57.680
 Joining out?

18:57.680 --> 18:58.320
 That's what I'm saying.

18:58.320 --> 19:02.800
 Yeah, Charles is definitely... He only goes to places that have Institute in the name, right?

19:02.800 --> 19:06.000
 It has worked out that way. Well, academic places anyway.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.960
 Well, no, I was a visiting scientist at UPIN or visiting something at UPIN.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.920
 Oh, wow. I just understood your joke.

19:13.920 --> 19:14.400
 Which one?

19:16.320 --> 19:17.200
 Five minutes later.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.920
 I like to set these sort of time bombs.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.040
 The Institute is in the...

19:21.920 --> 19:24.880
 That Charles only goes to places that have Institute in the name.

19:25.680 --> 19:30.560
 So I guess Georgia... I forget that Georgia Tech is Georgia Institute of Technology.

19:30.560 --> 19:35.280
 The number of people who refer to it as Georgia Tech University is large and incredibly year

19:35.280 --> 19:39.040
 old. It's one of the few things that genuinely gets under my skin.

19:39.040 --> 19:42.640
 But like schools like Georgia Tech and MIT have as part of the ethos.

19:42.640 --> 19:47.520
 Like there is... I want to say there's an abbreviation that someone taught me.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.520
 Like IHTFP, something like that.

19:49.520 --> 19:53.280
 Like there's an expression which is basically, I hate being here.

19:53.280 --> 19:57.840
 Which they say so proudly. And that is definitely not the ethos at Brown.

19:57.840 --> 20:02.080
 Like Brown is... There's a little more pampering and empowerment and stuff.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.880
 And it's not like we're going to crush you and you're going to love it.

20:04.880 --> 20:08.320
 So yeah, I think there's a... I think the ethoses are different.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.160
 That's interesting, yeah.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.120
 We had Drownproofer.

20:11.920 --> 20:12.720
 What's that? Drownproofer?

20:12.720 --> 20:15.040
 In order to graduate from Georgia Tech, this is a true thing.

20:15.040 --> 20:15.760
 Feel free to look it up.

20:16.880 --> 20:17.440
 If you...

20:17.440 --> 20:18.720
 A lot of schools have this, by the way.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.720
 No. Actually, Georgia Tech was barely the first.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.920
 Brandeis has it.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.320
 Had it.

20:23.040 --> 20:27.280
 I feel like Georgia Tech was the first in a lot of things.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.720
 It was the first in a lot of things.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.480
 Had the first Master's degree in Georgia.

20:30.480 --> 20:30.960
 Stop that.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.160
 First Masters in Computer Science, actually.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.440
 Right. Online Masters.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.040
 Well, that too, but way back in the 60s.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.240
 NSF, right?

20:38.240 --> 20:38.640
 Yeah, yeah.

20:38.640 --> 20:41.840
 Feel the first information in Computer Science Master's degree in the country.

20:42.720 --> 20:47.600
 But the Georgia Tech, it used to be the case that I would graduate from Georgia Tech.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.840
 You had to take a Drownproofing class.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.880
 Where effectively, they threw you in the water to hide you up.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.560
 If you didn't drown, you got to graduate.

20:54.560 --> 20:55.600
 Hide you up?

20:55.600 --> 20:56.240
 I believe so.

20:56.240 --> 20:56.720
 No.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.320
 You basically... There were certainly versions of it.

20:58.320 --> 21:01.440
 But I mean, luckily, they ended it just before I had to graduate

21:01.440 --> 21:02.960
 because otherwise I would have never graduated.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.160
 That wasn't going to happen.

21:04.160 --> 21:08.000
 I want to say 84, 83, someone around them, they ended it.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.440
 But yeah, it used to have to prove you could tread water

21:11.440 --> 21:14.720
 for some ridiculous amount of time or you couldn't graduate.

21:14.720 --> 21:15.440
 No, it was more than two minutes.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.240
 I bet it was two minutes.

21:16.240 --> 21:16.800
 Okay, well, we'll look.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.000
 And it was in a bathtub.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.720
 It was in a pool.

21:20.720 --> 21:21.360
 But it was a real thing.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.360
 But that idea that pushed you...

21:23.360 --> 21:24.240
 Fully clothed.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.120
 Yeah, fully clothed.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.360
 I don't think... I bet it was that and not tied up.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.760
 Because who needs to learn how to swim when you're tied?

21:30.320 --> 21:30.640
 Nobody.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.200
 But who needs to learn to swim when you're actually falling

21:33.200 --> 21:34.080
 into the water dressed?

21:34.080 --> 21:34.880
 That's a real thing.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.280
 I think your facts are getting in the way with a good story.

21:37.280 --> 21:37.920
 Oh, that's fair.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.320
 That's fair.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.120
 I didn't mean to...

21:39.120 --> 21:39.520
 All right.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.320
 So they tie you up.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.760
 Sometimes the narrative matters.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.120
 But whatever it was, you had to...

21:43.120 --> 21:44.720
 It was called drownproofing for a reason.

21:44.720 --> 21:48.080
 The point of the story, Michael, is that...

21:48.080 --> 21:48.720
 Struggle.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.360
 It's...

21:49.360 --> 21:50.480
 Well, no, but that's good.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.160
 It doesn't bring it back to struggle.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.880
 That's a part of what Georgia Tech has always been.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.240
 And we struggle with that, by the way,

21:56.880 --> 21:59.680
 about what we want to be, particularly as things go.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.000
 But you sort of...

22:02.000 --> 22:06.480
 How much can you be pushed without breaking?

22:06.480 --> 22:08.720
 And you come out of the other end stronger, right?

22:08.720 --> 22:10.320
 There's this saying we used to have when I was an undergrad.

22:10.320 --> 22:13.200
 There was Georgia Tech, building tomorrow the night before.

22:14.240 --> 22:17.680
 And it was just kind of idea that, you know,

22:17.680 --> 22:19.360
 give me something impossible to do,

22:19.360 --> 22:20.720
 and I'll do it in a couple of days,

22:20.720 --> 22:24.000
 because that's what I just spent the last four or five or six years with.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.080
 That ethos definitely stuck to you.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.880
 Having now done a number of projects with you,

22:28.880 --> 22:30.240
 you definitely will do it the night before.

22:30.240 --> 22:31.200
 That's not entirely true.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.520
 There's nothing wrong with waiting until the last minute.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.520
 The secret is knowing when the last minute is.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.000
 Right.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.160
 That's brilliantly put.

22:38.160 --> 22:41.520
 Yeah, that is a definite Charles statement

22:41.520 --> 22:42.960
 that I am trying not to embrace.

22:44.640 --> 22:47.600
 Well, and I appreciate that because you helped move my last minute.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.640
 That's a social construct where you converge together

22:50.640 --> 22:52.400
 with the definitional last minute is.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.560
 And we figure that all together.

22:54.560 --> 22:58.400
 In fact, MIT, you know, I'm sure a lot of universities have this,

22:58.400 --> 23:03.600
 but MIT has like MIT time that everyone has always agreed together

23:03.600 --> 23:05.360
 that there is such a concept,

23:05.360 --> 23:08.640
 and everyone just keeps showing up like 10 to 15 to 20,

23:08.640 --> 23:11.280
 depending on the department, late to everything.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.000
 So there's like a weird drift that happens.

23:14.000 --> 23:14.720
 It's kind of fascinating.

23:14.720 --> 23:15.760
 Yeah, we're five minutes.

23:15.760 --> 23:16.480
 We're five minutes.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.480
 In fact, the classes will say, you know,

23:18.480 --> 23:20.240
 well, this is no longer true, actually,

23:20.240 --> 23:22.400
 but it used to be a class that started eight,

23:22.400 --> 23:23.920
 but actually it started eight or five.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.320
 It ends at nine, actually it ends at eight, 55.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.280
 Everything's five minutes off,

23:27.280 --> 23:29.280
 and nobody expects anything to start until five minutes

23:29.280 --> 23:31.440
 after the half hour, whatever it is.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.080
 It still exists.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.040
 It hurts my head.

23:33.040 --> 23:37.680
 Well, let's rewind the clock back to the 50s and 60s

23:37.680 --> 23:38.800
 when you guys met.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.640
 How did you, I'm just kidding, I don't know.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.960
 But what, can you tell the story of how you met?

23:42.960 --> 23:45.280
 So you've, like the internet and the world

23:45.280 --> 23:50.080
 kind of knows you as connected in some ways

23:50.080 --> 23:52.880
 in terms of education, of teaching the world.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.560
 That's like the public facing thing,

23:54.560 --> 23:56.640
 but how did you as human beings

23:56.640 --> 24:00.560
 and as collaborators meet?

24:00.560 --> 24:01.680
 I think there's two stories.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.440
 One is how we met,

24:03.440 --> 24:06.160
 and the other is how we got to know each other.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.160
 I'm not gonna say follow, I'm not gonna say follow,

24:08.160 --> 24:11.120
 I'm gonna say that we came to understand that we...

24:11.120 --> 24:14.080
 Had some common something, yeah.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.200
 It's funny, because on the surface,

24:15.200 --> 24:17.200
 I think we're different in a lot of ways,

24:17.200 --> 24:18.800
 but there's something that's just consonant.

24:18.800 --> 24:19.760
 Yeah, I mean, now we complete each other's...

24:19.760 --> 24:21.600
 That's just consonant.

24:21.600 --> 24:22.000
 There you go.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.440
 Afternoons.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.840
 So I will tell the story of how we met,

24:25.840 --> 24:27.840
 and I'll let Michael tell the story of how we met.

24:27.840 --> 24:28.480
 Okay, all right.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.000
 Okay, so here's how we met.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.800
 I was already at that point was AT&T Labs.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.000
 There's a long, interesting story there,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.280
 but anyway, I was there,

24:35.280 --> 24:38.640
 and Michael was coming to interview.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.160
 He was a professor at Duke at the time,

24:40.160 --> 24:43.840
 but decided for reasons that he wanted to be in New Jersey.

24:45.040 --> 24:48.720
 And so that would mean Bell Labs slash AT&T Labs.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.520
 And we were doing interview,

24:49.520 --> 24:51.520
 interviews are very much like academic interviews,

24:51.520 --> 24:52.400
 and so I had to be there.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.720
 We all had to meet with him afterwards

24:54.720 --> 24:56.160
 and so on, one on one.

24:56.160 --> 24:59.280
 But it was obvious to me that he was going to be hired,

24:59.280 --> 25:00.960
 like no matter what, because everyone loved him.

25:00.960 --> 25:03.200
 They were just talking about all the great stuff he did.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.080
 Oh, he did this great thing,

25:04.080 --> 25:06.320
 and you had just won something at AAAI, I think,

25:06.320 --> 25:08.400
 or maybe you got 18 papers in AAAI that year.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.200
 I got the best paper award at AAAI for the crossword stuff.

25:11.200 --> 25:11.920
 Right, exactly.

25:11.920 --> 25:12.880
 So that had all happened,

25:12.880 --> 25:14.320
 and everyone was going on and on and on

25:14.320 --> 25:14.880
 about it actually.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.800
 So Tinder was saying incredibly nice things about you.

25:16.800 --> 25:17.200
 Really?

25:17.200 --> 25:17.600
 Yes.

25:17.600 --> 25:17.760
 So...

25:17.760 --> 25:19.280
 He can be very grumpy.

25:19.280 --> 25:19.600
 Yes.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.240
 So that's very...

25:20.240 --> 25:20.880
 That's nice to hear.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.320
 He was grumpily saying very nice things.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.040
 Oh, that makes sense.

25:23.040 --> 25:23.920
 Yeah, it does make sense.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.840
 So, you know, so it was going to come.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.040
 So why were we...

25:27.040 --> 25:27.920
 Why was I meeting him?

25:27.920 --> 25:28.880
 I had something else I had to do.

25:28.880 --> 25:29.760
 I can't remember what it was.

25:29.760 --> 25:30.160
 Yeah.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.120
 Probably involved comic books.

25:31.120 --> 25:34.080
 So he remembers meeting me as inconveniencing his afternoon.

25:34.080 --> 25:34.800
 So he came...

25:34.800 --> 25:36.000
 So I eventually came to my office.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.960
 I was in the middle of trying to do something.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.880
 I can't remember what, and he came and he sat down.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.040
 And for reasons that are purely accidental,

25:41.040 --> 25:42.480
 despite what Michael thinks,

25:42.480 --> 25:45.120
 my desk at the time was set up in such a way

25:45.120 --> 25:46.560
 that had sort of an L shape,

25:46.560 --> 25:48.640
 and the chair on the outside was always lower

25:48.640 --> 25:50.240
 than the chair that I was in.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.400
 And, you know, the kind of point was to...

25:52.400 --> 25:54.240
 The only reason I think that it was on purpose

25:54.240 --> 25:56.000
 is because you told me it was on purpose.

25:56.000 --> 25:56.720
 I don't remember that.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.880
 Anyway, the thing is that, you know, it kind of gives...

25:58.880 --> 26:00.080
 His guest chair was really low

26:00.080 --> 26:02.800
 so that he could look down at everybody.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.720
 The idea was just to simply create a nice environment

26:04.720 --> 26:06.080
 that you were asking for a mortgage,

26:06.080 --> 26:06.960
 and I was going to say no.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.000
 That was the point.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.280
 It was a very simple idea here.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.080
 Anyway, so we sat there and we just talked for a little while,

26:12.080 --> 26:14.240
 and I think he got the impression that I didn't like him.

26:14.240 --> 26:14.880
 It wasn't true.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.520
 Strongly got that impression.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.800
 The talk was really good.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.040
 And he pulled the assignment.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.560
 The talk, by the way, was terrible.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.960
 And right after the talk, I said to my host,

26:20.960 --> 26:23.120
 Michael Kearns, who ultimately was my boss.

26:23.120 --> 26:23.680
 I'm a huge fan.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.680
 I'm a friend and a huge fan of Michael, yeah.

26:25.680 --> 26:25.920
 Yeah.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.760
 He is a remarkable person.

26:29.440 --> 26:30.480
 After my talk, I went into the...

26:30.480 --> 26:31.520
 He went into the basketball.

26:31.520 --> 26:32.400
 I went...

26:32.400 --> 26:32.960
 Racquetball.

26:32.960 --> 26:33.520
 He's good at everything.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.320
 No, basketball.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.680
 No, but basketball and racquetball, too.

26:35.680 --> 26:36.240
 Squash.

26:36.240 --> 26:36.880
 He's a squash.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.000
 Squash, squash, not racquetball.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.280
 Yeah, squash, which is not...

26:39.920 --> 26:41.280
 Racquetball, yes.

26:41.280 --> 26:42.080
 Squash, no.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.520
 And I hope you hear that, Michael.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.440
 You mean as a game, not his skill level,

26:47.440 --> 26:48.560
 because I'm pretty sure he's...

26:48.560 --> 26:50.240
 All right.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.440
 There's some competitiveness there,

26:51.440 --> 26:54.240
 but the point is that it was like the middle of the day.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.600
 I had full day of interviews.

26:55.600 --> 26:56.480
 Like, I've met with people,

26:56.480 --> 26:59.040
 but then in the middle of the day, I gave a job talk.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.440
 And then there was going to be more interviews,

27:01.440 --> 27:04.320
 but I pulled Michael aside and I said,

27:04.880 --> 27:07.120
 I think it's in both of our best interests

27:07.120 --> 27:10.960
 if I just leave now, because that was so bad

27:10.960 --> 27:12.400
 that it'd just be embarrassing

27:12.400 --> 27:13.920
 if I have to talk to any more people.

27:13.920 --> 27:16.080
 Like, you look bad for having invited me.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.880
 Like, it's just, let's just forget this ever happened.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.520
 So I don't think the talk went well.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.880
 That's one of the most Michael Lipman

27:22.880 --> 27:24.480
 set of sentences I think I've ever heard.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.200
 He did great.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.040
 Or at least everyone knew he was great,

27:27.040 --> 27:28.080
 so maybe it didn't matter.

27:28.080 --> 27:28.640
 I was there.

27:28.640 --> 27:29.760
 I remember the talk,

27:29.760 --> 27:31.520
 and I remember him being very much

27:31.520 --> 27:33.840
 the way I remember him now in any given week.

27:33.840 --> 27:34.640
 So it was good.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.480
 And we met and we talked about stuff.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.760
 He thinks I didn't like him, but...

27:37.760 --> 27:39.200
 Because he was so grumpy.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.560
 Must have been the chair thing.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.560
 The chair thing and the low voice, I think.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.520
 Like, he obviously...

27:43.520 --> 27:46.880
 And that slight skeptical look.

27:46.880 --> 27:47.200
 Yes.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.400
 I have no idea what you're talking about.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.760
 Well, I probably didn't have any idea

27:51.760 --> 27:52.480
 what you were talking about.

27:53.680 --> 27:54.640
 Anyway, I liked him.

27:54.640 --> 27:55.520
 He asked me questions.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.240
 I answered questions.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.200
 I felt bad about myself.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.000
 It was a normal day.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.240
 What's a normal day?

28:00.240 --> 28:01.280
 And then he left.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.000
 And then he left.

28:02.000 --> 28:02.960
 And that's how we met.

28:02.960 --> 28:03.760
 Can we take a...

28:03.760 --> 28:05.680
 And then I got hired and I was in the group.

28:05.680 --> 28:08.240
 Can we take a slight tangent on this topic of...

28:08.960 --> 28:09.840
 It sounds like...

28:10.720 --> 28:12.480
 Maybe you could speak through the bigger picture.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.160
 It sounds like you're quite self critical.

28:14.880 --> 28:15.600
 Who, Charles?

28:15.600 --> 28:16.240
 No, you.

28:16.240 --> 28:16.800
 Oh.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.000
 I think I can do better.

28:18.000 --> 28:18.400
 I can do better.

28:18.400 --> 28:19.600
 I'll try me again.

28:19.600 --> 28:20.320
 I'll do better.

28:23.360 --> 28:26.160
 Yeah, that was like a three out of 10 response.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.520
 So let's try to work it up to five and six.

28:30.640 --> 28:35.120
 I remember Marvin Minsky said on a video interview

28:35.120 --> 28:38.640
 something that the key to success in academic research

28:38.640 --> 28:40.080
 is to hate everything you do.

28:40.080 --> 28:44.160
 For some reason...

28:44.160 --> 28:45.040
 I think I followed that

28:45.040 --> 28:46.480
 because I hate everything he's done.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.520
 That's a good line.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.880
 That's a success.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.200
 Maybe that's a keeper.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.600
 But do you find that resonance with you at all

28:57.600 --> 28:59.600
 in how you think about talks and so on?

28:59.600 --> 29:00.800
 I would say it differently.

29:00.800 --> 29:01.440
 It's not that...

29:01.440 --> 29:02.160
 No, not really.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.680
 That's such an MIT view of the world.

29:04.240 --> 29:07.760
 So I remember talking about this as a student.

29:07.760 --> 29:10.800
 You were basically told I will clean it up

29:10.800 --> 29:12.000
 for the purposes of the podcast.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.160
 My work is crap.

29:14.160 --> 29:14.800
 My work is crap.

29:14.800 --> 29:15.360
 My work is crap.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.080
 My work is crap.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.520
 Then you go to a conference or something

29:17.520 --> 29:18.880
 and you're like, everybody else's work is crap.

29:18.880 --> 29:19.840
 Everybody else's work is crap.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.200
 And you feel better and better about it,

29:22.080 --> 29:23.120
 relatively speaking.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.960
 And then you sort of keep working on it.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.720
 I don't hate my work.

29:26.720 --> 29:27.600
 That resonates with me.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.800
 Yes, I've never hated my work,

29:28.800 --> 29:32.480
 but I have been dissatisfied with it.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.920
 And I think being dissatisfied,

29:35.920 --> 29:38.560
 being okay with the fact that you've taken a positive step,

29:38.560 --> 29:39.600
 the derivatives positive,

29:40.240 --> 29:42.240
 maybe even the second derivatives positive,

29:42.240 --> 29:45.040
 that's important because that's a part of the hope, right?

29:45.040 --> 29:46.240
 But you have to...

29:46.240 --> 29:47.440
 But I haven't gotten there yet.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.840
 If that's not there, that I haven't gotten there yet,

29:49.840 --> 29:53.360
 then it's hard to move forward, I think.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.320
 So I buy that,

29:54.320 --> 29:56.400
 which is a little different from hating everything that you do.

29:56.400 --> 29:56.720
 Yeah.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.200
 I mean, there's things that I've done

29:59.200 --> 30:01.120
 that I like better than I like myself.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.920
 So it's separating me from the work, essentially.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.720
 So I think I am very critical of myself,

30:06.720 --> 30:08.560
 but sometimes the work I'm really excited about,

30:08.560 --> 30:10.000
 and sometimes I think it's kind of good.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.120
 It doesn't happen right away.

30:11.120 --> 30:14.160
 So I found the work that I've liked, that I've done,

30:15.360 --> 30:17.760
 most of it, I liked it in retrospect

30:18.400 --> 30:20.400
 more when I was far away from it in time.

30:21.040 --> 30:24.240
 I have to be fairly excited about it to get done.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.280
 No, excited at the time,

30:25.280 --> 30:26.800
 but then happy with the result or...

30:26.800 --> 30:28.640
 But years later, or even I might go back,

30:28.640 --> 30:30.640
 you know what, that actually turned out to matter.

30:30.640 --> 30:30.960
 That wasn't terrible, yeah, yeah.

30:30.960 --> 30:31.760
 That turned out to matter.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.440
 Or, oh gosh, it turns out I've been thinking

30:33.440 --> 30:34.080
 about that.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.240
 It's actually influenced all the work that I've done since

30:36.240 --> 30:37.680
 without realizing it.

30:37.680 --> 30:38.960
 Boy, that guy was smart.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.640
 Yeah, that guy had a future.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.080
 He's going places.

30:44.640 --> 30:45.200
 I think there's...

30:45.200 --> 30:46.880
 So yeah, so I think there's something to it.

30:46.880 --> 30:47.920
 I think there's something to the idea.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.280
 You've got to hate what you do,

30:49.280 --> 30:50.240
 but it's not quite hate.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.400
 It's just being unsatisfied.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.160
 And different people motivate themselves differently.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.480
 I don't happen to motivate myself with self loathing.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.720
 I happen to motivate myself with something else.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.040
 So you're able to sit back and be proud

31:01.040 --> 31:03.840
 of, in retrospect, of the work you've done.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.680
 Well, and it's easier when you can connect it

31:05.680 --> 31:07.920
 with other people, because then you can be proud of them.

31:07.920 --> 31:09.360
 Proud of the people, yeah.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.160
 And then the question is...

31:10.160 --> 31:11.680
 No, you can still safely hate yourself.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.560
 Yeah, that's right.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.360
 It's win, win, Michael, or at least win, lose,

31:15.360 --> 31:16.400
 which is what you're looking for.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.400
 Oh, wow.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.560
 There's so many brothers behind this.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.160
 Yeah, there's levels.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.880
 So how did you actually meet, meet?

31:24.880 --> 31:25.600
 Yeah, Michael.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.600
 So the way I think about it is,

31:27.600 --> 31:29.840
 because we didn't do much research together,

31:29.840 --> 31:33.440
 at AT&T, but then we all got laid off.

31:33.440 --> 31:34.960
 So that was...

31:34.960 --> 31:36.560
 By the way, sorry to interrupt,

31:36.560 --> 31:39.120
 but that was one of the most magical places,

31:39.120 --> 31:40.560
 historically speaking.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.560
 They did not appreciate what they had.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.840
 And how do we...

31:45.840 --> 31:48.800
 I feel like there's a profound lesson in there, too.

31:48.800 --> 31:49.840
 How do we get it...

31:49.840 --> 31:51.840
 Like, why was it so magical?

31:51.840 --> 31:53.760
 Was it just the coincidence of history,

31:53.760 --> 31:55.040
 or is there something special about...

31:55.040 --> 31:56.560
 There were some really good managers

31:56.560 --> 31:59.440
 and people who really believed in machine learning.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.760
 As this is going to be important,

32:01.760 --> 32:04.560
 let's get the people who are thinking about this

32:04.560 --> 32:07.200
 in creative and insightful ways

32:07.200 --> 32:09.360
 and put them in one place and stir.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.960
 Yeah, but even beyond that, right,

32:10.960 --> 32:14.640
 it was Bell Labs at its heyday.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.160
 And even when we were there,

32:16.160 --> 32:17.360
 which I think was past its heyday.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.960
 And to be clear, he's gotten to be at Bell Labs.

32:18.960 --> 32:20.160
 I never got to be at Bell Labs.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.360
 I joined after that.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.760
 Yeah, I should have been 91 as a grad student.

32:23.760 --> 32:27.440
 So I was there for a long time, every summer, except for...

32:27.440 --> 32:29.440
 So twice I worked for companies

32:29.440 --> 32:31.440
 that had just stopped being Bell Labs.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.440
 Bellcore and then AT&T Labs.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.440
 So Bell Labs was several locations

32:35.440 --> 32:37.440
 or for the research, or is it one...

32:37.440 --> 32:39.440
 Definitely several.

32:39.440 --> 32:41.440
 Jersey's involved somehow.

32:41.440 --> 32:42.440
 They're all in Jersey.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.440
 Yeah, they're all over the place.

32:43.440 --> 32:44.440
 But they were in a couple places in Jersey.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.440
 Murray Hill was the Bell Labs place.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.440
 So you had an office at Murray Hill

32:49.440 --> 32:51.440
 at one point in your career.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.440
 Yeah, and I played Ultimate Frisbee

32:53.440 --> 32:56.440
 on the cricket pitch at Bell Labs at Murray Hill.

32:56.440 --> 32:58.440
 And then it became AT&T Labs when it split off with Luce

32:58.440 --> 33:00.440
 during what we called Trivestiture.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.440
 Better than Michael Korn's at Ultimate Frisbee?

33:03.440 --> 33:04.440
 Yeah. Oh, yeah.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.440
 Okay.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.440
 But I think that one's not boasting.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.440
 I think Charles plays a lot of Ultimate,

33:08.440 --> 33:10.440
 and I don't think Michael does.

33:10.440 --> 33:12.440
 Yes, but that wasn't the point.

33:12.440 --> 33:13.440
 The point is, yes.

33:13.440 --> 33:14.440
 Sorry.

33:14.440 --> 33:18.440
 I have played on a championship winning Ultimate Frisbee team

33:18.440 --> 33:20.440
 or whatever, Ultimate team with Charles.

33:20.440 --> 33:22.440
 So I know how good he is.

33:22.440 --> 33:23.440
 He's really good.

33:23.440 --> 33:24.440
 How good I was anyway when I was younger.

33:24.440 --> 33:25.440
 But the thing is...

33:25.440 --> 33:27.440
 I know how young he was when he was younger.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.440
 That's true.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.440
 So much younger than now.

33:29.440 --> 33:30.440
 He's older now.

33:30.440 --> 33:31.440
 Yes, I know that.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.440
 Michael was a much better basketball player than I was.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.440
 Michael Korn's.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.440
 Yes, no, not Michael.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.440
 To be clear, I've not played basketball with you.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.440
 So you don't know how terrible I am,

33:40.440 --> 33:42.440
 but you have a probably pretty good guess.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.440
 And that you're not as good as Michael Korn's.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.440
 He's tall and athletic.

33:46.440 --> 33:47.440
 And he cared about it.

33:47.440 --> 33:48.440
 He's very athletic.

33:48.440 --> 33:49.440
 He's very good.

33:49.440 --> 33:50.440
 And probably competitive.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.440
 I love hanging out with Michael.

33:51.440 --> 33:52.440
 Anyway, but we were talking about something else,

33:52.440 --> 33:53.440
 although I no longer remember what it was.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.440
 What were we talking about?

33:54.440 --> 33:55.440
 Bell Labs.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.440
 But also Labs.

33:56.440 --> 33:59.440
 So this was kind of cool about what was magical about it.

33:59.440 --> 34:03.440
 The first thing you have to know is that Bell Labs was an arm of the government, right?

34:03.440 --> 34:05.440
 Because AT&T was an arm of the government.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.440
 It was a monopoly.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.440
 And, you know, every month you paid a little thing on your phone bill,

34:10.440 --> 34:14.440
 which turned out was a tax for like all the research that Bell Labs was doing.

34:14.440 --> 34:17.440
 And, you know, they invented transistors and the laser and whatever else they did.

34:17.440 --> 34:20.440
 The Big Bang or whatever the cosmic background radiation.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.440
 Yeah, they did all that stuff.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.440
 They had some amazing stuff with directional microphones, by the way.

34:23.440 --> 34:27.440
 I got to go in this room where they had all these panels and everything.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.440
 And we would talk at one another and he'd lose some panels around.

34:30.440 --> 34:33.440
 And then he'd have me step, two steps to the left.

34:33.440 --> 34:36.440
 And I couldn't hear a thing he was saying because nothing was bouncing off the walls.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.440
 And then he would shut it all down and you could hear your heartbeat,

34:39.440 --> 34:42.440
 which is deeply disturbing to hear your heartbeat.

34:42.440 --> 34:43.440
 You can feel it.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.440
 I mean, you can feel it now.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.440
 There's just so much other sort of noise around.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.440
 Anyway, Bell Labs is about pure research.

34:48.440 --> 34:51.440
 It was a university in some sense, the purest sense of a university,

34:51.440 --> 34:53.440
 but without students.

34:53.440 --> 34:57.440
 So it was all the faculty working with one another and students would come in to learn.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.440
 They would come in for three or four months, you know, during the summer and they would go away.

35:00.440 --> 35:02.440
 But it was just this kind of wonderful experience.

35:02.440 --> 35:03.440
 I could walk out my door.

35:03.440 --> 35:07.440
 In fact, I would often have to walk out my door and deal with Rich Sutton

35:07.440 --> 35:11.440
 and Michael Kerns yelling at each other about whatever it is they were yelling about

35:11.440 --> 35:14.440
 the proper way to prove something or another.

35:14.440 --> 35:17.440
 And I could just do that and Dave McAllister and even Peter Stone

35:17.440 --> 35:22.440
 and all of these other people, including Satinder and then eventually Michael.

35:22.440 --> 35:26.440
 And it was just a place where you could think thoughts and it was okay

35:26.440 --> 35:30.440
 because so long as once every 25 years or so somebody invented a transistor,

35:30.440 --> 35:31.440
 it paid for everything else.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.440
 You could afford to take the risk.

35:33.440 --> 35:38.440
 And then when that all went away, it became harder and harder and harder to justify it

35:38.440 --> 35:41.440
 as far as the folks who were very far away were concerned.

35:41.440 --> 35:45.440
 And there was such a fast turnaround among middle management on the AT&T side

35:45.440 --> 35:47.440
 that you never had a chance to really build a relationship.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.440
 At least people like us didn't have a chance to build a relationship.

35:50.440 --> 35:54.440
 So when the diaspora happened, it was amazing, right?

35:54.440 --> 35:55.440
 Everybody left.

35:55.440 --> 35:58.440
 And I think everybody ended up at a great place and made a huge,

35:58.440 --> 36:01.440
 continued to do really good work with machine learning.

36:01.440 --> 36:04.440
 But it was a wonderful place and people will ask me,

36:04.440 --> 36:06.440
 what's the best job you've ever had?

36:06.440 --> 36:13.440
 And as a professor, the answer that I would give is, well, probably Bell Labs

36:13.440 --> 36:15.440
 in some very real sense.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.440
 And I would never have a job like that again because Bell Labs doesn't exist anymore.

36:18.440 --> 36:21.440
 And, you know, Microsoft research is great and Google does good stuff

36:21.440 --> 36:25.440
 and you can pick IBM, you can tell everyone to, but Bell Labs was magical.

36:25.440 --> 36:30.440
 It was around for, it was an important time and represents a high water market

36:30.440 --> 36:32.440
 in basic research in the US.

36:32.440 --> 36:36.440
 Is there something you could say about the physical proximity and the chance collisions?

36:36.440 --> 36:42.440
 Like we live in this time of the pandemic where everyone is maybe trying to see

36:42.440 --> 36:46.440
 the silver lining and accepting the remote nature of things.

36:46.440 --> 36:52.440
 Is there one of the things that people like faculty that I talked to miss

36:52.440 --> 36:55.440
 is the procrastination.

36:55.440 --> 37:00.440
 Like the chance to make everything is about meetings that are supposed to be.

37:00.440 --> 37:04.440
 There's not a chance to just, you know, talk about comic book or whatever,

37:04.440 --> 37:06.440
 like go into discussion that's totally pointless.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.440
 So it's funny you say this because that's how we met.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.440
 Met was exactly that.

37:10.440 --> 37:14.440
 So I'll let Michael say that, but I'll just add one thing, which is just that, you know,

37:14.440 --> 37:19.440
 research is a social process and it helps to have random social interactions

37:19.440 --> 37:21.440
 even if they don't feel social at the time.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.440
 That's how you get things done.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.440
 One of the great things about the AI lab when I was there,

37:25.440 --> 37:28.440
 I don't quite know what it looks like now once they move buildings,

37:28.440 --> 37:31.440
 but we had entire walls that were whiteboards and people would just get up there

37:31.440 --> 37:34.440
 and they were just right and people would walk up and you'd have arguments

37:34.440 --> 37:39.440
 and you'd explain things to one another and you got so much out of the freedom to do that.

37:39.440 --> 37:44.440
 You had to be okay with people challenging every freaking word you said,

37:44.440 --> 37:49.440
 which I would sometimes find deeply irritating, but most of the time it was quite useful.

37:49.440 --> 37:54.440
 But the sort of pointlessness and the interaction was in some sense the point, at least for me.

37:54.440 --> 37:59.440
 Yeah, I mean, you, I think offline yesterday I mentioned Josh Tannenbaum and he's very much,

37:59.440 --> 38:07.440
 he put, he's, man, he's such an inspiration in the childlike way that he pulls you in on any topic.

38:07.440 --> 38:11.440
 It doesn't even have to be about machine learning or the brain.

38:11.440 --> 38:19.440
 He'll just pull you into a closest writable surface, which is still, you can find whiteboards in MIT everywhere.

38:19.440 --> 38:26.440
 And just like basically cancel all meetings and talk for a couple hours about some aimless thing

38:26.440 --> 38:30.440
 and it feels like the whole world, the time space continuum kind of warps

38:30.440 --> 38:32.440
 and that becomes the most important thing.

38:32.440 --> 38:39.440
 And then it's just, it's definitely something worth missing in this world where everything's remote.

38:39.440 --> 38:42.440
 There's some magic to the physical presence.

38:42.440 --> 38:47.440
 Whenever I wonder myself whether MIT really is as great as I remember it, I just go talk to Josh.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.440
 Yeah, you know, that's funny.

38:49.440 --> 38:56.440
 There's a few people in this world that carry the best of what particular institutions stand for, right?

38:56.440 --> 38:57.440
 It's Josh.

38:57.440 --> 39:00.440
 I mean, I don't, my guess is he's unaware of this.

39:00.440 --> 39:01.440
 That's the point.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.440
 Yeah.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.440
 That the masters are not aware of their mastery.

39:05.440 --> 39:08.440
 So, I'll meet.

39:08.440 --> 39:12.440
 Yes, but first the tangent, no.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.440
 How did you meet me?

39:14.440 --> 39:21.440
 So I'm not sure what you were thinking, but when it started to dawn on me that maybe we had a longer term bond

39:21.440 --> 39:28.440
 was after we all got laid off and you had decided at that point that we were still paid.

39:28.440 --> 39:35.440
 We were given an opportunity to like do a job search and kind of make a transition, but it was clear that we were done.

39:35.440 --> 39:41.440
 And I would go to my office to work and you would go to my office to keep me from working.

39:41.440 --> 39:43.440
 That was my recollection of it.

39:43.440 --> 39:49.440
 You had decided that there was really no point in working for the company because our relationship with the company was done.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.440
 Yeah, but remember I felt that way beforehand.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.440
 It wasn't about the company.

39:52.440 --> 39:55.440
 It was about the set of people there doing really cool things and it always, always been that way.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.440
 But we were working on something together.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.440
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

39:58.440 --> 40:05.440
 Oh, so at the very end we all got laid off, but then our boss came to our boss's boss came to us because our boss was Michael Kearns

40:05.440 --> 40:11.440
 and he had jumped ship brilliantly, like perfect timing, like things like right before the ship was about to sink.

40:11.440 --> 40:23.440
 He was like, gotta go and landed perfectly because Michael Kearns and leaving the rest of us to go like, this is fine.

40:23.440 --> 40:27.440
 And then it was clear that wasn't fine and we were all toast.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.440
 So we had this sort of long period of time.

40:29.440 --> 40:36.440
 But then our boss figured out, okay, wait, maybe we can save a couple of these people if we can have them do something really useful.

40:36.440 --> 40:43.440
 And the useful thing was we were going to make basically an automated assistant that could help you with your calendar.

40:43.440 --> 40:47.440
 You could like tell it things and it would respond appropriately.

40:47.440 --> 40:53.440
 It would just kind of integrate across all sorts of your personal information.

40:53.440 --> 41:00.440
 And so me and Charles and Peter Stone were set up as the crack team to actually solve this problem.

41:00.440 --> 41:05.440
 Other people maybe were too theoretical that they thought and but we could actually get something done.

41:05.440 --> 41:09.440
 So we sat down to get something done and there wasn't time and it wouldn't have saved us anyway.

41:09.440 --> 41:11.440
 And so it all kind of went downhill.

41:11.440 --> 41:18.440
 But the interesting, I think, Coda to that is that our boss's boss is a guy named Ron Brockman.

41:18.440 --> 41:28.440
 And when he left AT&T, because we were all laid off, he went to DARPA, started up a program there that became Calo,

41:28.440 --> 41:36.440
 which is the program from which Siri sprung, which is a digital assistant that helps you with your calendar and a bunch of other things.

41:36.440 --> 41:45.440
 It really, you know, in some ways got its start with me and Charles and Peter trying to implement this vision that Ron Brockman had,

41:45.440 --> 41:49.440
 that he ultimately got implemented through his role at DARPA.

41:49.440 --> 41:55.440
 So when I'm trying to feel less bad about having been laid off from what is possibly the greatest job of all time,

41:55.440 --> 41:59.440
 I think about, well, we kind of help birth Siri.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.440
 That's something.

42:01.440 --> 42:07.440
 And then he did other things too, but we got to spend a lot of time in his office and talk about...

42:07.440 --> 42:09.440
 We got to spend a lot of time in my office.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.440
 Yeah.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.440
 Yeah, yeah.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.440
 And so then we went on our merry way.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.440
 Everyone went to different places.

42:15.440 --> 42:20.440
 Charles landed at Georgia Tech, which was what he always dreamed he would do.

42:20.440 --> 42:23.440
 And so that worked out well.

42:23.440 --> 42:27.440
 I came up with a saying at the time, which is luck favors the Charles.

42:27.440 --> 42:30.440
 It's kind of like luck favors the prepared.

42:30.440 --> 42:35.440
 But Charles, like, he wished something and then it would basically happen just the way he wanted.

42:35.440 --> 42:38.440
 It was inspirational to see things go that way.

42:38.440 --> 42:39.440
 Things worked out.

42:39.440 --> 42:40.440
 And we stayed in touch.

42:40.440 --> 42:45.440
 And then I think it really helped when you were working on...

42:45.440 --> 42:49.440
 I mean, you kept me in the loop for things like threads and the work that you were doing at Georgia Tech.

42:49.440 --> 42:52.440
 But then when they were starting their online master's program,

42:52.440 --> 42:55.440
 he knew that I was really excited about MOOCs and online teaching.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.440
 And he's like, I have a plan.

42:57.440 --> 43:00.440
 And I'm like, tell me your plan. He's like, I can't tell you the plan yet.

43:00.440 --> 43:05.440
 Because they were deep in negotiations between Georgia Tech and Udacity to make this happen.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.440
 And they didn't want it to leak.

43:07.440 --> 43:10.440
 So Charles would kept teasing me about it, but wouldn't tell me what was actually going on.

43:10.440 --> 43:11.440
 And eventually it was announced.

43:11.440 --> 43:15.440
 And he said, I would like you to teach the machine learning course with me.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.440
 I'm like, that can't possibly work.

43:17.440 --> 43:19.440
 But it was a great idea.

43:19.440 --> 43:20.440
 And it was super fun.

43:20.440 --> 43:23.440
 It was a lot of work to put together, but it was really great.

43:23.440 --> 43:29.440
 Was that the first time you thought about, first of all, was it the first time you got seriously into teaching?

43:29.440 --> 43:31.440
 I mean, you know, I was a professor.

43:31.440 --> 43:38.440
 This was already after you jumped to, so like, there's a little bit of jumping around in time.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.440
 Yeah, sorry about that.

43:39.440 --> 43:40.440
 There's a pretty big jump in time.

43:40.440 --> 43:42.440
 So like the MOOCs thing.

43:42.440 --> 43:45.440
 So Charles got to Georgia Tech and he, I mean, maybe Charles, maybe this is a Charles story.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.440
 I guess it was like 2002.

43:46.440 --> 43:48.440
 He got to Georgia Tech in 2002.

43:48.440 --> 44:07.440
 And worked on things like revamping the curriculum, the undergraduate curriculum, so that it had some kind of semblance of modular structure because computer science was at the time moving from a fairly narrow specific set of topics to touching a lot of other parts of intellectual life.

44:07.440 --> 44:10.440
 And the curriculum was supposed to reflect that.

44:10.440 --> 44:14.440
 And so Charles played a big role in kind of redesigning that.

44:14.440 --> 44:19.440
 And then for my labors, I ended up as associate dean.

44:19.440 --> 44:20.440
 Right.

44:20.440 --> 44:24.440
 He got to become associate dean in charge of educational stuff.

44:24.440 --> 44:29.440
 It should be a valuable lesson if you're good at something.

44:29.440 --> 44:33.440
 They will give you responsibility to do more of that thing.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.440
 Don't show competence.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.440
 Don't show competence if you don't have responsibility.

44:38.440 --> 44:39.440
 Here's what they say.

44:39.440 --> 44:42.440
 The reward for good work is more work.

44:42.440 --> 44:49.440
 The reward for bad work is less work, which I don't know, depending on what you're trying to do that week.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.440
 One of those is better than the other.

44:51.440 --> 44:58.440
 Well, one of the problems with the word work, sorry to interrupt, is that it seems to be an antonym in this particular language.

44:58.440 --> 45:06.440
 We have the opposite of happiness, but it seems like they're, they're like, that's one of, you know, we talked about balance.

45:06.440 --> 45:12.440
 It's always like work life balance always rub me the wrong way as a terminology.

45:12.440 --> 45:13.440
 I know it's just words.

45:13.440 --> 45:14.440
 Right.

45:14.440 --> 45:17.440
 The opposite of work is play, but ideally work is play.

45:17.440 --> 45:19.440
 Oh, I can't tell you how much time I'd spend.

45:19.440 --> 45:23.440
 Certainly I was at Bell Labs, except for a few very key moments.

45:23.440 --> 45:24.440
 As a professor, I would do this too.

45:24.440 --> 45:29.440
 I was just saying, I cannot believe they're paying me to do this because it's fun.

45:29.440 --> 45:34.440
 It's something that I would, I would do for a hobby if I could anyway.

45:34.440 --> 45:35.440
 So that's what it worked out.

45:35.440 --> 45:38.440
 Are you sure you want to be saying that when this is being recorded?

45:38.440 --> 45:40.440
 As a dean, that is not true at all.

45:40.440 --> 45:41.440
 I need a raise.

45:41.440 --> 45:49.440
 But, but I think here with this, that even though a lot of time passed, you know, Michael and I talked almost every, well, we texted almost every day during the period.

45:49.440 --> 45:56.440
 Charles at one point took me, there was the ICML conference, the machine learning conference was in Atlanta.

45:56.440 --> 46:00.440
 I was the chair, the general chair of the conference.

46:00.440 --> 46:04.440
 Charles was my publicity chair or something like that or fund raising chair.

46:04.440 --> 46:05.440
 Fund raising chair.

46:05.440 --> 46:06.440
 Yeah.

46:06.440 --> 46:11.440
 But he decided it'd be really funny if he didn't actually show up for the conference in his own home city.

46:11.440 --> 46:28.440
 So he didn't, but he did at one point pick me up at the conference in his Tesla and drove me to the Atlanta mall and forced me to buy an iPhone because he didn't like how it was to text with me and thought it would be better for him if I had an iPhone.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.440
 The text would be somehow smoother.

46:30.440 --> 46:31.440
 And it was.

46:31.440 --> 46:32.440
 And it was.

46:32.440 --> 46:33.440
 And it is.

46:33.440 --> 46:34.440
 Better.

46:34.440 --> 46:35.440
 And so, yeah, but, but it was.

46:35.440 --> 46:36.440
 Yeah.

46:36.440 --> 46:39.440
 Charles forced me to get an iPhone so that he could text me more efficiently.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.440
 I thought that was an interesting moment.

46:41.440 --> 46:42.440
 It works for me anyway.

46:42.440 --> 46:46.440
 So we kept talking the whole time and then eventually we did the, we did the teaching thing and it was great.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.440
 And there's a couple of reasons for that, by the way.

46:48.440 --> 46:51.440
 One is I really wanted to do something different.

46:51.440 --> 46:52.440
 Like you've got this medium here.

46:52.440 --> 46:54.440
 People claim it can change things.

46:54.440 --> 47:00.440
 What's a thing that you could do in this medium that you could not do otherwise besides edit, right?

47:00.440 --> 47:01.440
 I mean, what could you do?

47:01.440 --> 47:04.440
 And being able to do something with another person was that kind of thing.

47:04.440 --> 47:05.440
 It's very hard.

47:05.440 --> 47:09.440
 I mean, you can take turns, but teaching together, having conversations is very hard, right?

47:09.440 --> 47:10.440
 So that was a cool thing.

47:10.440 --> 47:12.440
 The second thing, give me an excuse to do more stuff with him.

47:12.440 --> 47:13.440
 Yeah.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.440
 I always thought he makes it sound brilliant.

47:15.440 --> 47:17.440
 And it is, I guess.

47:17.440 --> 47:22.440
 But it's at the time, it really felt like I've got a lot to do, Charles is saying.

47:22.440 --> 47:27.440
 And it would be great if Michael could teach the course and I could just hang out.

47:27.440 --> 47:28.440
 Yeah.

47:28.440 --> 47:29.440
 Just kind of coast on that.

47:29.440 --> 47:31.440
 Well, that's what the second class was more like that.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.440
 Because the second class was explicit.

47:33.440 --> 47:35.440
 The first class, it was at least half.

47:35.440 --> 47:37.440
 Yeah, but I do all the stuff.

47:37.440 --> 47:40.440
 I think you're once again letting the facts get in the way.

47:40.440 --> 47:41.440
 A good story.

47:41.440 --> 47:42.440
 A good story.

47:42.440 --> 47:44.440
 I should just let Charles talk.

47:44.440 --> 47:46.440
 But that's the facts that he saw.

47:46.440 --> 47:51.440
 So that was kind of true for 7642, which is the reinforcement learning class.

47:51.440 --> 47:52.440
 Because that was really his class.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.440
 You started with reinforcement learning?

47:53.440 --> 47:55.440
 No, we started with machine learning.

47:55.440 --> 48:00.440
 We started with machine learning, 7641, which is supervised learning, unsupervised learning,

48:00.440 --> 48:02.440
 and reinforcement learning and decision making.

48:02.440 --> 48:03.440
 Cram all that in there.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.440
 The kind of assignments that we talked about earlier.

48:05.440 --> 48:10.440
 And then eventually, about a year later, we did a follow on 7642, which is reinforcement learning and decision making.

48:10.440 --> 48:14.440
 The first class was based on something I had been teaching at that point for well over a decade.

48:14.440 --> 48:17.440
 And the second class was based on something Michael had been teaching.

48:17.440 --> 48:20.440
 Actually, I learned quite a bit teaching that class with him.

48:20.440 --> 48:21.440
 But he drove most of that.

48:21.440 --> 48:28.440
 But the first one I drove most of it was all my material, although I had stolen that material originally from slides I found online from Michael,

48:28.440 --> 48:32.440
 who had originally stolen that material from, I guess, slides he found online, probably from Andrew Moore.

48:32.440 --> 48:34.440
 Because the jokes were the same anyway.

48:34.440 --> 48:37.440
 At least some of the, at least when I found the slide, some of the stuff.

48:37.440 --> 48:41.440
 Yes, every machine learning class taught in the early 2000s stole from Andrew Moore.

48:41.440 --> 48:43.440
 A particular joke or two.

48:43.440 --> 48:44.440
 At least the structure.

48:44.440 --> 48:50.440
 Now, I did, and he did actually a lot more with reinforcement learning and such and game theory and those kinds of things.

48:50.440 --> 48:51.440
 But, you know, we all sort of built.

48:51.440 --> 48:52.440
 You need a research world.

48:52.440 --> 48:53.440
 No, no, no.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.440
 I mean, in teaching that class.

48:54.440 --> 48:57.440
 The coverage was different than what other people started.

48:57.440 --> 49:01.440
 Most people were just doing supervised learning and maybe a little bit of, you know, clustering and whatnot.

49:01.440 --> 49:02.440
 But we took it all the way to.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.440
 A lot of it just comes from Tom Mitchell's book.

49:04.440 --> 49:05.440
 Oh, no.

49:05.440 --> 49:07.440
 Yeah, except, well, half of it comes from Tom Mitchell's book, right?

49:07.440 --> 49:09.440
 But the other half doesn't.

49:09.440 --> 49:11.440
 This is why it's all readings, right?

49:11.440 --> 49:13.440
 Because certain things weren't invented when Tom Mitchell's book.

49:13.440 --> 49:14.440
 Yeah, okay, that's true.

49:14.440 --> 49:15.440
 Right.

49:15.440 --> 49:17.440
 But it was, it was quite good.

49:17.440 --> 49:20.440
 But there's a reason for that besides, you know, just, I wanted to do it.

49:20.440 --> 49:31.440
 I wanted to do something new and I wanted to do something with him, which is a realization, which is, despite what you might believe, he's an introvert and I'm an introvert, or I'm on the edge of being an introvert anyway.

49:31.440 --> 49:36.440
 But both of us, I think, enjoy the energy of the crowd, right?

49:36.440 --> 49:45.440
 There's something about talking to people and bringing them into whatever we find interesting that is empowering, energizing or whatever.

49:45.440 --> 49:55.440
 And I found the idea of staring alone at a computer screen and then talking off of materials less inspiring than I wanted it to be.

49:55.440 --> 49:59.440
 And I had, in fact, done a MOOC for Udacity on algorithms.

49:59.440 --> 50:07.440
 And it was a week in a dark room talking at the screen, writing on the little pad.

50:07.440 --> 50:15.440
 I didn't know this was happening, but they had watched the crew had watched some of the videos while, you know, like in the middle of this and they're like, something's wrong.

50:15.440 --> 50:19.440
 You're sort of shutting down.

50:19.440 --> 50:23.440
 And I think a lot of it was, I'll make jokes and no one would laugh.

50:23.440 --> 50:24.440
 Yeah.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.440
 And I felt like the crowd hated me.

50:26.440 --> 50:27.440
 Now, of course, there was no crowd.

50:27.440 --> 50:29.440
 So, like, it wasn't rational.

50:29.440 --> 50:30.440
 Yeah.

50:30.440 --> 50:38.440
 Each time I tried it and I got no reaction, it just was taking the energy out of my performance out of my presentation.

50:38.440 --> 50:40.440
 Such a fantastic metaphor for grad school.

50:40.440 --> 50:44.440
 Anyway, by working together, we could play off each other and have it.

50:44.440 --> 50:48.440
 And keep the energy up because you can't let your guard down for a moment with Charles.

50:48.440 --> 50:50.440
 He'll just overpower you.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.440
 I have no idea what you're talking about.

50:52.440 --> 50:53.440
 But we would work really well together.

50:53.440 --> 50:56.440
 I thought and we knew each other, so I knew that we could sort of make it work.

50:56.440 --> 50:59.440
 Plus, I was the associate dean, so they had to do what I told them to do.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.440
 So we had to do that.

51:00.440 --> 51:01.440
 We had to make it work.

51:01.440 --> 51:03.440
 And so it worked out very well, I thought.

51:03.440 --> 51:04.440
 Well enough that we...

51:04.440 --> 51:06.440
 With great power comes great power.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.440
 That's right.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.440
 And we became smooth and curly.

51:09.440 --> 51:15.440
 And that's when we did the overfitting thriller video.

51:15.440 --> 51:16.440
 Yeah.

51:16.440 --> 51:17.440
 Yeah.

51:17.440 --> 51:18.440
 Yeah.

51:18.440 --> 51:19.440
 That's a thing.

51:19.440 --> 51:20.440
 So, can we just, like, smooth and curly?

51:20.440 --> 51:21.440
 Where did that come from?

51:21.440 --> 51:22.440
 Okay.

51:22.440 --> 51:23.440
 So it happened.

51:23.440 --> 51:24.440
 It was completely spontaneous.

51:24.440 --> 51:25.440
 These are nicknames you go by.

51:25.440 --> 51:26.440
 Yeah.

51:26.440 --> 51:27.440
 Or...

51:27.440 --> 51:28.440
 It's what the students call us.

51:28.440 --> 51:29.440
 Yeah.

51:29.440 --> 51:30.440
 He was lecturing.

51:30.440 --> 51:33.720
 So the way that we structured the lectures is one of us is the lecturer and one of us

51:33.720 --> 51:35.440
 is basically the student.

51:35.440 --> 51:36.440
 And so the...

51:36.440 --> 51:37.440
 He was lecturing on...

51:37.440 --> 51:41.440
 The lecturer prepares all the materials, comes up with the quizzes, and then the student

51:41.440 --> 51:43.160
 comes in not knowing anything.

51:43.160 --> 51:45.440
 So it was, you know, just like being on campus.

51:45.440 --> 51:48.440
 And I was doing game theory in particular, the prisoner's dilemma.

51:48.440 --> 51:49.440
 Yeah.

51:49.440 --> 51:50.440
 The prisoner's dilemma.

51:50.440 --> 51:53.440
 And so he needed to set up a little prisoner's dilemma grid, so he drew it and I could see

51:53.440 --> 51:54.760
 what he was drawing.

51:54.760 --> 51:59.120
 And the prisoner's dilemma consists of two players, two parties, so he decided he would

51:59.120 --> 52:01.360
 make little cartoons of the two of us.

52:01.360 --> 52:06.760
 And so there was two criminals, right, that were deciding whether or not to rat each other

52:06.760 --> 52:08.080
 out.

52:08.080 --> 52:13.280
 One of them, he drew as, you know, a circle with a smiley face and a kind of goatee thing,

52:13.280 --> 52:14.400
 smooth head.

52:14.400 --> 52:16.320
 And the other one with all sorts of curly hair.

52:16.320 --> 52:18.400
 And he said, this is smooth and curly.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.720
 I said smooth and curly.

52:19.720 --> 52:23.000
 He said, no, no, smooth with a V. It's very important that it have a V.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
 And then...

52:24.000 --> 52:29.160
 And then the students really took to that, like they found that relatable.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.280
 He started singing Smooth Criminal by Michael Jackson.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:32.280 --> 52:33.640
 And those names stuck.

52:33.640 --> 52:38.560
 So we now have a video series, an episode, our kind of first actual episode should be

52:38.560 --> 52:47.080
 coming out today, smooth and curly on video, where the two of us discuss episodes of West

52:47.080 --> 52:48.080
 World.

52:48.080 --> 52:50.800
 We watched West World and we're like, huh, what does this say about computer science

52:50.800 --> 52:51.800
 and AI?

52:51.800 --> 52:53.880
 And we've never, we did not watch it.

52:53.880 --> 52:55.840
 I mean, I know it's on season three or whatever we have.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.040
 As of this recording, it's on season three.

52:58.040 --> 52:59.040
 And...

52:59.040 --> 53:00.040
 We watched now two episodes total.

53:00.040 --> 53:01.040
 Yeah.

53:01.040 --> 53:02.040
 I think I watched three.

53:02.040 --> 53:03.040
 What do you think about West World?

53:03.040 --> 53:04.040
 Two episodes in.

53:04.040 --> 53:08.240
 So I can tell you, so far, I'm just guessing what's going to happen next.

53:08.240 --> 53:11.240
 It seems like bad things are going to happen with the robots uprising.

53:11.240 --> 53:12.240
 It's a lot of...

53:12.240 --> 53:13.240
 Spoiler alert.

53:13.240 --> 53:17.080
 So I have not, I mean, you know, I vaguely remember a movie existing, so I assume it's

53:17.080 --> 53:18.200
 related to that.

53:18.200 --> 53:19.200
 But...

53:19.200 --> 53:20.320
 That was more my time than your time, Charles.

53:20.320 --> 53:21.480
 That's right, because you're much older than I am.

53:21.480 --> 53:25.040
 I think the important thing here is that it's narrative, right?

53:25.040 --> 53:26.200
 It's all about telling a story.

53:26.200 --> 53:27.560
 That's the whole driving thing.

53:27.560 --> 53:31.480
 But the idea that they would give these reveries, that they would make people...

53:31.480 --> 53:32.480
 Let them remember.

53:32.480 --> 53:34.480
 They would make them remember the awful things that happened.

53:34.480 --> 53:35.480
 How horrible things that happened.

53:35.480 --> 53:36.800
 Who could possibly think that was going to happen?

53:36.800 --> 53:37.800
 I got it.

53:37.800 --> 53:38.800
 I mean, I don't know.

53:38.800 --> 53:40.280
 I've only seen the first two episodes or maybe the third one.

53:40.280 --> 53:41.280
 I think I've only seen the third one.

53:41.280 --> 53:42.280
 You know what it was?

53:42.280 --> 53:43.280
 Do you know what the problem is?

53:43.280 --> 53:44.280
 What?

53:44.280 --> 53:45.280
 That the robots were actually designed by Hannibal Lecter.

53:45.280 --> 53:46.280
 That's true.

53:46.280 --> 53:47.280
 They were.

53:47.280 --> 53:49.560
 So like, what do you think is going to happen?

53:49.560 --> 53:50.560
 Bad things.

53:50.560 --> 53:53.360
 It's clear that things are happening and characters are being introduced and we don't

53:53.360 --> 53:54.520
 yet know anything.

53:54.520 --> 53:58.560
 But still, I was just struck by how it's all driven by narrative and story.

53:58.560 --> 54:01.280
 And there's all these implied things, like programming hap...

54:01.280 --> 54:05.760
 The programming interface is talking to them about what's going on in their heads, which

54:05.760 --> 54:06.760
 is both...

54:06.760 --> 54:10.160
 I mean, artistically, it's probably useful to film it that way.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.560
 But think about how it would work in real life.

54:11.560 --> 54:12.560
 That just seems very great.

54:12.560 --> 54:13.560
 But there was...

54:13.560 --> 54:14.960
 We saw in the second episode, there's a screen.

54:14.960 --> 54:15.960
 You could see things.

54:15.960 --> 54:16.960
 They were wearing like cool clothes.

54:16.960 --> 54:20.440
 It was quite interesting to just kind of ask this question.

54:20.440 --> 54:21.440
 So far.

54:21.440 --> 54:23.800
 I mean, I assume it veers often to never, never land at some point.

54:23.800 --> 54:24.800
 But...

54:24.800 --> 54:25.800
 So we don't know.

54:25.800 --> 54:26.800
 We can't answer that question.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.800
 I'm also a fan of a guy named Alex Garland.

54:28.800 --> 54:31.440
 He's a director of Ex Machina.

54:31.440 --> 54:33.960
 And he is the first...

54:33.960 --> 54:36.280
 I wonder if Kubrick was like this, actually.

54:36.280 --> 54:41.800
 Is he like studies what would it take to program in AI systems?

54:41.800 --> 54:45.080
 Like he's curious enough to go into that direction.

54:45.080 --> 54:50.200
 On the Westworld side, I felt there was more emphasis on the narratives than like actually

54:50.200 --> 54:52.560
 asking like computer science questions.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.760
 Like, how would you build this?

54:54.760 --> 54:55.760
 How would you...

54:55.760 --> 54:57.760
 And how would you debug it?

54:57.760 --> 54:58.760
 I still...

54:58.760 --> 55:01.000
 To me, that's the key issue.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.400
 They were terrible debuggers.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.400
 Yeah.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.400
 Well, they said specifically.

55:04.400 --> 55:07.240
 So we make a change and we put it out in the world and that's bad because something terrible

55:07.240 --> 55:08.240
 could happen.

55:08.240 --> 55:11.040
 Like, if you're putting things out in the world and you're not sure whether something terrible

55:11.040 --> 55:13.240
 is going to happen, your process is probably...

55:13.240 --> 55:16.680
 I just feel like there should have been someone whose sole job it was was to walk around and

55:16.680 --> 55:20.600
 poke his head at it and say, what could possibly go wrong just over and over again?

55:20.600 --> 55:22.160
 I would have loved if there was an...

55:22.160 --> 55:24.760
 I did watch a lot more and I'm not giving anything away.

55:24.760 --> 55:29.840
 I would have loved it if there was like an episode where like the new intern is like debugging

55:29.840 --> 55:34.200
 a new model or something and like it just keeps failing and they're like, all right.

55:34.200 --> 55:39.560
 And then more turns into like a episode of Silicon Valley or something like that versus

55:39.560 --> 55:46.440
 like this ominous AI systems that are constantly like threatening the fabric of this world that's

55:46.440 --> 55:47.440
 been created.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.440
 Yeah.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.440
 Yeah.

55:49.440 --> 55:50.640
 And you know, this reminds me of something that...

55:50.640 --> 55:51.640
 So I agree with that.

55:51.640 --> 55:55.720
 That should be very cool, at least for the small percentage of people who care about debugging

55:55.720 --> 55:56.720
 systems.

55:56.720 --> 55:57.720
 But the other thing is...

55:57.720 --> 55:58.720
 Debugging.

55:58.720 --> 55:59.720
 The series.

55:59.720 --> 56:00.720
 Yeah.

56:00.720 --> 56:01.720
 It falls into...

56:01.720 --> 56:02.720
 Think of the sequels.

56:02.720 --> 56:03.720
 Fear of the debugging.

56:03.720 --> 56:04.720
 Oh my gosh.

56:04.720 --> 56:05.720
 And anyway, so...

56:05.720 --> 56:06.720
 It's a nightmare show.

56:06.720 --> 56:07.720
 It's a horror movie.

56:07.720 --> 56:08.720
 I think that's where we lose people.

56:08.720 --> 56:11.920
 By the way, early on is the people who either decide either figure out debugging or think

56:11.920 --> 56:12.920
 debugging is terrible.

56:12.920 --> 56:13.920
 This is part of...

56:13.920 --> 56:14.920
 Oh, where we lose people in computer science.

56:14.920 --> 56:17.320
 This is part of the struggle versus suffering, right?

56:17.320 --> 56:20.520
 You get through it and you kind of get the skills of it or you're just like, this is

56:20.520 --> 56:21.520
 dumb.

56:21.520 --> 56:22.520
 This is a dumb way to do anything.

56:22.520 --> 56:23.600
 And I think that's when we lose people.

56:23.600 --> 56:26.720
 But well, I'll leave it at that.

56:26.720 --> 56:34.280
 But I think that there's something really, really neat about framing it that way.

56:34.280 --> 56:39.160
 But what I don't like about all of these things, and I love Tex Mockingham, by the way, I love

56:39.160 --> 56:43.160
 that the ending was very depressing.

56:43.160 --> 56:48.920
 One of the things I have to talk to Alex about, he says that the thing that nobody noticed

56:48.920 --> 56:58.520
 he put in is at the end, spoiler alert, the robot turns and looks at the camera and smiles

56:58.520 --> 57:00.480
 very briefly.

57:00.480 --> 57:08.080
 And to him, he thought that his definition of passing the general version of the touring

57:08.080 --> 57:18.200
 test or the consciousness test is smiling for no one.

57:18.200 --> 57:22.880
 It's like the Chinese room kind of experiment, it's not always trying to act for others,

57:22.880 --> 57:28.560
 but just on your own, being able to have a relationship with the actual experience and

57:28.560 --> 57:29.560
 just take it in.

57:29.560 --> 57:30.560
 I don't know.

57:30.560 --> 57:32.560
 He said nobody noticed the magic of it.

57:32.560 --> 57:36.680
 I have this vague feeling that I remember the smile, but now you've just put the memory

57:36.680 --> 57:38.160
 in my head, so probably not.

57:38.160 --> 57:42.720
 But I do think that that's interesting, although by looking at the camera, you are smiling

57:42.720 --> 57:43.720
 for the audience, right?

57:43.720 --> 57:44.720
 You're breaking the fourth wall.

57:44.720 --> 57:49.680
 It seems, I mean, well, that's a limitation in the medium, but I like that idea.

57:49.680 --> 57:53.760
 But here's the problem I have with all of those movies, all of them.

57:53.760 --> 57:56.520
 But I know why it's this way, and I enjoy those movies.

57:56.520 --> 58:03.680
 And Westworld is, it sets up the problem of AI as succeeding and then having something

58:03.680 --> 58:08.400
 we cannot control, but it's not the bad part of AI.

58:08.400 --> 58:11.200
 The bad part of AI is the stuff we're living through now, right?

58:11.200 --> 58:13.800
 It's using the data to make decisions that are terrible.

58:13.800 --> 58:17.480
 It's not the intelligence that's going to go out there and surpass us and take over

58:17.480 --> 58:22.840
 the world or lock us into a room to starve to death slowly over multiple days.

58:22.840 --> 58:29.680
 It's instead the tools that we're building that are allowing us to make the terrible

58:29.680 --> 58:33.240
 decisions we would have less efficiently made before, right?

58:33.240 --> 58:37.480
 Others are very good at making us more efficient, including being more efficient at doing terrible

58:37.480 --> 58:38.480
 things.

58:38.480 --> 58:40.280
 And that's the part of the AI we have to worry about.

58:40.280 --> 58:45.600
 It's not the true intelligence that we're going to build sometime in the future, probably

58:45.600 --> 58:48.280
 long after we're around.

58:48.280 --> 58:55.280
 But I just, I think that whole framing of it sort of misses the point, even though it

58:55.280 --> 58:56.280
 is inspiring.

58:56.280 --> 58:59.360
 And I was inspired by those ideas, right, that I got into this in part because I wanted

58:59.360 --> 59:03.480
 to build something like that, philosophical questions were interesting to me, but that's

59:03.480 --> 59:06.320
 not where the terror comes from, the terror comes from the everyday.

59:06.320 --> 59:09.920
 And you can construct the situation, it's in the subtlety of the interaction between

59:09.920 --> 59:16.240
 AI and the human, like with social networks, all the stuff you're doing with interactive

59:16.240 --> 59:18.000
 artificial intelligence.

59:18.000 --> 59:24.520
 But I feel like how 9,000 came a little bit closer to that in 2001 Space Odyssey because

59:24.520 --> 59:29.080
 it felt like a personal assistant.

59:29.080 --> 59:35.160
 It felt like closer to the AI systems we have today and the real things we might actually

59:35.160 --> 59:44.360
 encounter, which is over relying in some fundamental way on our like dumb assistants or on social

59:44.360 --> 59:54.200
 networks like over offloading too much of us onto things that require internet and power

59:54.200 --> 59:55.360
 and so on.

59:55.360 --> 59:59.840
 And thereby becoming powerless as a standalone entity.

59:59.840 --> 1:00:05.760
 And then when that thing starts to misbehave in some subtle way, it creates a lot of problems.

1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:10.680
 And those problems are dramatized when you're in space because you don't have a way to walk

1:00:10.680 --> 1:00:11.680
 away.

1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:16.040
 Well, as the man said, once we started making the decisions for you, it stopped being your

1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:17.360
 world, right?

1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:20.600
 That's the matrix, Michael, in case you don't remember.

1:00:20.600 --> 1:00:26.280
 But on the other hand, I could say, no, because isn't that what we do with people anyway?

1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:29.880
 The shared intelligence that is humanity is relying on other people constantly.

1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:33.480
 I mean, we hyper specialize as individuals.

1:00:33.480 --> 1:00:34.640
 We're still generally intelligent.

1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:37.520
 We make our own decisions in a lot of ways, but we leave most of this up to other people

1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:40.080
 and that's perfectly fine.

1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:43.640
 And by the way, everyone doesn't necessarily share our goals.

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:45.480
 Sometimes they seem to be quite against us.

1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:49.440
 Sometimes we make decisions that others would see as against our own interests and yet we

1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:51.320
 somehow manage it, manage and survive.

1:00:51.320 --> 1:01:00.360
 I'm not entirely sure why an AI would actually make that worse or even different, really.

1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:01.680
 You mentioned the matrix.

1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:04.500
 Do you think we're living in a simulation?

1:01:04.500 --> 1:01:10.360
 It does feel like a thought game more than a real scientific question.

1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:11.760
 Well, I'll tell you why.

1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:13.360
 I think it's an interesting thought experiment.

1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:16.320
 See what you think from a computer science perspective.

1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:22.840
 It's a good experiment of how difficult would it be to create a sufficiently realistic world

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:26.840
 that us humans would enjoy being in.

1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:27.840
 That's almost like a competition.

1:01:27.840 --> 1:01:31.560
 If we're living in a simulation, then I don't believe that we were put in the simulation.

1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:36.320
 I believe that it's just physics playing out and we came out of that.

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:38.080
 I don't think...

1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:41.560
 So you think you have to build the universe and all the fun and work?

1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:43.840
 I think the universe itself, we can think of that as a simulation.

1:01:43.840 --> 1:01:51.680
 In fact, sometimes I try to understand what it's like for a computer to start to think

1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:52.680
 about the world.

1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:58.160
 I try to think about the world, things like quantum mechanics where it doesn't feel very

1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:00.760
 natural to me at all.

1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:05.520
 It really strikes me as I don't understand this thing that we're living in.

1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:06.520
 It has...

1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:09.480
 There's weird things happening in it that don't feel natural to me at all.

1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:13.480
 Now, if you want to call that as the result of a simulator, okay.

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:14.480
 I'm fine with that.

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:17.080
 Because there's the bugs in the simulation.

1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:18.080
 There's the bugs.

1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:21.760
 I mean, the interesting thing about simulation is that it might have bugs.

1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:22.760
 That's the thing that I...

1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:25.680
 But there would be bugs for the people in the simulation.

1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:26.680
 That's just reality.

1:02:26.680 --> 1:02:27.680
 They're not bugs.

1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:29.360
 Unless you were very enough to know that there was a bug.

1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:30.360
 But I think...

1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:31.360
 Back to the matrix.

1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:32.360
 Yeah.

1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:33.360
 The way you put the question...

1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:35.160
 I don't think that we live in a simulation created for us.

1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:36.160
 Okay.

1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:37.160
 I would say that.

1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:38.160
 I think that's interesting.

1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:39.160
 I've actually never thought about it that way.

1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:41.880
 I mean, the way you asked the question though is, could you create a world that is enough

1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:43.200
 for us humans?

1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:49.160
 It's an interestingly sort of self referential question, because the beings that created

1:02:49.160 --> 1:02:53.400
 the simulation probably have not created the simulation that's realistic for them.

1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:56.280
 But we're in the simulation, and so it's realistic for us.

1:02:56.280 --> 1:03:02.240
 So we could create a simulation that is fine for the people in the simulation, as it were,

1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:05.360
 that would not necessarily be fine for us as the creators of the simulation.

1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:08.840
 But while you can forget, I mean, when you go into the...

1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:14.800
 If you play video games of virtual reality, you can... some suspension of disbelief or

1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:15.800
 whatever.

1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:16.800
 Yeah.

1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:17.800
 It becomes a world.

1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:22.000
 It becomes a world, even like in brief moments, you forget that another world exists.

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.240
 I mean, that's what good stories do.

1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:25.240
 They pull you in.

1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:28.520
 And the question is, is it possible to pull...

1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:29.520
 Our brains are limited.

1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:33.120
 Is it possible to pull the brain in to where we actually stay in that world longer and

1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:35.000
 longer and longer and longer?

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.200
 And not only that, but we don't want to leave.

1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:45.160
 And so, especially, this is the key thing about the developing brain, is if we journey

1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:47.840
 into that world early on in life, often.

1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:49.560
 How would you even know?

1:03:49.560 --> 1:03:50.560
 Yeah.

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:51.560
 Yeah.

1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:56.280
 But from a video game design perspective, from a Westworld perspective, I think it's

1:03:56.280 --> 1:04:01.960
 an important thing for even computer scientists to think about, because it's clear that video

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:04.880
 games are getting much better.

1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:09.920
 And virtual reality, although it's been ups and downs, just like artificial intelligence,

1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:16.960
 it feels like virtual reality will be here in a very impressive form if we were to fast

1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:22.200
 forward 100 years into the future in a way that might change society fundamentally.

1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:23.200
 Like, if I were to...

1:04:23.200 --> 1:04:26.600
 I'm very limited in predicting the future, as all of us are.

1:04:26.600 --> 1:04:33.320
 But if I were to try to predict, like, in which way I'd be surprised to see the world

1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:39.600
 100 years from now, it'd be that... or impressed.

1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:43.880
 It'd be that we're all no longer living in this physical world, that we're all living

1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:45.040
 in a virtual world.

1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:51.240
 You really need to read Calculating God by Sawyer.

1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:52.240
 It's a...

1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:53.240
 He'll read it in a night.

1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:55.000
 It's a very easy read, but it's a...

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:58.400
 Assuming you're that kind of reader, but it's a good story.

1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:01.440
 And it's kind of about this, but not in a way that it appears.

1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:08.280
 And I really enjoyed the thought experiment, and I think it's pretty sure it's Robert Sawyer.

1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:13.160
 But anyway, he's apparently Canadian's top science fiction writer, which is why the story

1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:15.160
 mostly takes place in Toronto.

1:05:15.160 --> 1:05:17.160
 But it's a very good...

1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:23.800
 It's a very good sort of story that sort of imagines this very different kind of simulation

1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:29.360
 hypothesis sort of thing from, say, the egg, for example, you know, I'm talking about the

1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:36.400
 short story by the guy who did the Martian, who wrote the Martian.

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:37.400
 You know, I'm talking...

1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:38.400
 Matt Damon.

1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:39.400
 No.

1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:40.400
 The book.

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:45.840
 So we had this whole discussion that Michael doesn't partake in this exercise of reading.

1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:48.840
 He doesn't seem to like it, which seems very strange to me, considering how much he has

1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:49.840
 to read.

1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:50.840
 Yeah.

1:05:50.840 --> 1:05:51.840
 I read all the time.

1:05:51.840 --> 1:05:55.240
 I used to read 10 books every week when I was in sixth grade, or whatever.

1:05:55.240 --> 1:05:56.240
 I was...

1:05:56.240 --> 1:05:57.880
 A lot of it's science fiction, a lot of it.

1:05:57.880 --> 1:05:58.880
 A lot of it's history.

1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:00.080
 I love to read.

1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:01.680
 But anyway, you should recalculate in God.

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:03.840
 I think you'll...

1:06:03.840 --> 1:06:07.840
 It's very easy to read, like I said, and I think you'll enjoy sort of the ideas that

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:08.840
 it presents.

1:06:08.840 --> 1:06:09.840
 Yeah.

1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:13.080
 I think the thought experiment is quite interesting.

1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:17.400
 One thing I've noticed about people growing up now, I mean, we'll talk about social media,

1:06:17.400 --> 1:06:22.160
 but video games is a much bigger, bigger and bigger and bigger part of their lives.

1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:24.120
 And the video games have become much more realistic.

1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:31.600
 I think it's possible that the three of us are not...

1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:36.080
 Maybe the two of you are not familiar exactly with the numbers we're talking about here.

1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:37.240
 The number of people...

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:39.360
 It's bigger than movies, right?

1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:40.360
 It's huge.

1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:42.880
 I used to do a lot of the computational narrative stuff.

1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:47.840
 I understand that economists can actually see the impact of video games on the labor

1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:57.040
 market that there are fewer young men of a certain age participating in paying jobs

1:06:57.040 --> 1:07:01.640
 than you'd expect and that they trace it back to video games.

1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:06.400
 The problem with Star Trek was not warp drive or teleportation.

1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:08.320
 It was the holodeck.

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:12.160
 If you have the holodeck, that's it.

1:07:12.160 --> 1:07:13.160
 That's it.

1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:14.160
 You go in the holodeck, you never come out.

1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:20.520
 Once I saw that, I thought, okay, well, this is the end of humanity, they've been in the

1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:21.520
 holodeck.

1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:25.240
 Because that feels like the singularity, not some AGI or whatever.

1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:30.400
 It's some possibility to go into another world that can be artificially made better than

1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:32.560
 this one.

1:07:32.560 --> 1:07:35.600
 And slowing it down so you live forever or speeding it up so you appear to live forever

1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:39.120
 or making the decision of when to die.

1:07:39.120 --> 1:07:43.440
 And then most of us will just be old people on the porch yelling at the kids these days

1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:46.120
 in their virtual reality worlds.

1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:49.960
 But they won't hear us because they've got headphones on.

1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:56.840
 So I mean, rewinding back to MOOCs, is there lessons that you've speaking to kids these

1:07:56.840 --> 1:07:57.840
 days?

1:07:57.840 --> 1:07:58.840
 There you go.

1:07:58.840 --> 1:07:59.840
 That was a transition.

1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:00.840
 All right.

1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:03.480
 I'll fix it in post.

1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:06.560
 That's Charles's favorite phrase.

1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:07.560
 Fix it in post.

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:08.560
 Fix it in post.

1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:09.560
 Fix it in post.

1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:12.400
 I said, when we were recording all the time, whenever the editor didn't like something

1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:14.440
 or whatever, I would say, we'll fix it in post.

1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:15.840
 He hated that.

1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:16.840
 He hated that more than anything.

1:08:16.840 --> 1:08:20.760
 Because it was Charles's way of saying, I'm not going to do it again.

1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:22.400
 You're on your own for this one.

1:08:22.400 --> 1:08:24.280
 But it always got fixed in post.

1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:25.280
 Exactly.

1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:29.800
 So is there something you've learned about, I mean, it's interesting to talk about MOOCs,

1:08:29.800 --> 1:08:34.160
 is there something you've learned about the process of education, about thinking about

1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:35.160
 the present?

1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:40.280
 I think there's two lines of conversation to be had here is the future of education

1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:43.160
 in general that you've learned about.

1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:51.280
 And more pressurantly is the education in the times of COVID.

1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:55.960
 The second thing in some ways matters more than the first, for at least in my head, not

1:08:55.960 --> 1:09:01.120
 just because it's happening now, but because I think it's reminded us of a lot of things.

1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:05.160
 Coincidentally, today, there's an article out by a good friend of mine who's also a

1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:10.920
 professor at Georgia Tech, but more importantly, a writer and editor at The Atlantic, Ian Bogos.

1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:17.600
 And the title is something like, Americans will sacrifice anything for the college experience.

1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:22.360
 And it's about why we went back to college and why people wanted us to go back to college.

1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:26.440
 And it's not greedy presidents trying to get the last dollar from someone.

1:09:26.440 --> 1:09:28.080
 It's because they want to go to college.

1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:29.880
 And what they're paying for is not the classes.

1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:33.480
 What they're paying for is the college experience, it's not the education that's being there.

1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:39.440
 I've believed this for a long time that we continually make this mistake of people want

1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:42.160
 to go back to college as being people want to go back to class.

1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:43.160
 They don't.

1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:44.160
 They want to go back to campus.

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:45.160
 They want to move away from home.

1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:47.280
 They want to do all those things that people experience.

1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:48.280
 It's a rite of passage.

1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:53.960
 It's an identity if I can steal some of Ian's words here.

1:09:53.960 --> 1:09:54.960
 And I think that's right.

1:09:54.960 --> 1:10:01.040
 And I think what we've learned through COVID is it has made it, the disaggregation was

1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:05.680
 not the disaggregation of the education from the university place and that you can get

1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:10.000
 the best anywhere you want to in terms of there's lots of reasons why that is not necessarily

1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:11.000
 true.

1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:15.080
 The disaggregation is having it shoved in our faces that the reason to go again, that

1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:18.400
 the reason to go to college is not necessarily to learn.

1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:20.320
 It's to have the college experience.

1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:24.560
 And that's very difficult for us to accept even though we behave that way, most of us,

1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:26.560
 when we were undergrads.

1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:28.840
 A lot of us didn't go to every single class.

1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:31.520
 We learned and we got it and we look back on it and we're happy we had the learning

1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:35.120
 experience as well, obviously, particularly us because this is the kind of thing that

1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:36.120
 we do.

1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:39.640
 And my guess is that's true of the vast majority of your audience.

1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:44.440
 But that doesn't mean the I'm standing in front of you telling you this is the thing

1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:47.560
 that people are excited about.

1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:51.000
 And that's why they want to be there, primarily why they want to be there.

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:55.280
 So to me, that's what COVID has forced us to deal with, even though I think we're still

1:10:55.280 --> 1:11:00.120
 all in deep denial about it and hoping that it'll go back to that.

1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:01.560
 And I think about 85% of it will.

1:11:01.560 --> 1:11:04.160
 We'll be able to pretend that that's really the way it is again and we'll forget the

1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:05.440
 lessons of this.

1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:09.640
 But technically what will come out of it or technologically will come out of it is a way

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:15.080
 of providing a more dispersed experience through online education and these kinds of remote

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:16.080
 things that we've learned.

1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:20.600
 And we'll have to come up with new ways to engage them in the experience of college,

1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:25.240
 which includes not just the parties or the whatever kids do, but the learning part of

1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:29.560
 it so that they actually come out for five or six years later with having actually having

1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:31.000
 actually learned something.

1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.120
 So I think the world will be radically different afterwards.

1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:38.640
 And I think technology will matter for that, just not in the way that the people who were

1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:42.200
 building the technology originally imagined it would be.

1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:46.720
 And I think this would have been true even without COVID, but COVID has accelerated that

1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:47.880
 reality.

1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:52.280
 So it's happening in two or three years or five years as opposed to 10 or 15.

1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:55.480
 That was an amazing answer that I did not understand.

1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:58.120
 It was passionate and meaningful.

1:11:58.120 --> 1:11:59.120
 Shots fired.

1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:00.120
 But I don't know.

1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:01.120
 I just didn't know.

1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:02.120
 I'm not trying to criticize it.

1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:03.320
 I think I don't think I'm getting it.

1:12:03.320 --> 1:12:06.880
 So you mentioned disaggregation, so what's that?

1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:11.640
 So the power of technology that if you go on the West Coast and hang out long enough is

1:12:11.640 --> 1:12:14.760
 all about we're going to disaggregate these things together, the books from the bookstore,

1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:15.760
 that kind of a thing.

1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:19.960
 And then suddenly Amazon controls the universe and technology is a disruptor and people have

1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:22.920
 been predicting that for a higher education for a long time.

1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:23.920
 But certainly in the media.

1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:30.320
 So is this the sort of idea like students can aggregate on a campus someplace and then

1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:33.240
 take classes over the network anywhere?

1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:35.960
 Yeah, this is what people thought was going to happen, or at least people claimed it was

1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:36.960
 going to happen, right?

1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:39.080
 Because my daughter is essentially doing that now.

1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:41.280
 She's on one campus, but learning in a different campus.

1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:42.280
 Sure.

1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:43.280
 And COVID makes that possible, right?

1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:47.600
 Or COVID makes that all but avoidable, right?

1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:50.760
 But the idea originally was that you and I were going to create this machine learning

1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:53.520
 class and it was going to be great and then no one else would be the machine learning

1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:55.000
 class everyone changed, right?

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:56.200
 That was never going to happen.

1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:57.520
 But something like that you can see happened.

1:12:57.520 --> 1:12:58.720
 But I feel you didn't address that.

1:12:58.720 --> 1:12:59.720
 So why?

1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:00.720
 Why?

1:13:00.720 --> 1:13:01.720
 Why is it that?

1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:02.720
 Why Q?

1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:03.720
 Why?

1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:04.720
 I don't think that will be the thing that happens.

1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:07.160
 So the college experience, maybe I missed what the college experience was.

1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:10.080
 I thought it was peers, like people hanging around.

1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:11.280
 A large part of it is peers.

1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:13.240
 Well, it's peers and independence.

1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:14.240
 Yeah.

1:13:14.240 --> 1:13:15.240
 But none of that is...

1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:16.240
 At least that's...

1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:17.240
 You can do classes online for all of that.

1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:18.240
 No.

1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:19.240
 No, no, no.

1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:20.240
 Because...

1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:21.240
 No, definitely.

1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:22.240
 We're social people, right?

1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:25.320
 So when we take the classes, that also has to be part of an experience.

1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:26.320
 It's in a context.

1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:27.320
 And the context is the university.

1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:33.240
 And by the way, it actually matters that Georgia Tech really is different from Brown.

1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:34.240
 I see.

1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:37.800
 Because then students can choose the kind of experience they think is going to be best

1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:38.800
 for them.

1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:39.800
 Okay.

1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:42.280
 I think we're giving too much agency to the students in making an informed decision.

1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:43.280
 Okay.

1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:44.280
 But the truth...

1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:46.840
 But yes, they will make choices and they will have different experiences.

1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:48.760
 And some of those choices will be made for them.

1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:51.560
 Some of them will be choices they're making because they think it's this that or the other.

1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:52.680
 I just don't want to say...

1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:53.680
 I don't want to give the idea...

1:13:53.680 --> 1:13:54.680
 It's not homogenous.

1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:55.680
 Yes.

1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:56.680
 It's certainly not homogenous.

1:13:56.680 --> 1:13:57.680
 Right?

1:13:57.680 --> 1:13:59.600
 I mean, Georgia Tech is different from Brown.

1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:03.920
 Brown is different from pick your favorite state school in Iowa.

1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:05.880
 Iowa State, okay?

1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:08.000
 Which I guess is my favorite state school in Iowa.

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.720
 But these are all different.

1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:10.720
 They have different contexts.

1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:14.720
 And a lot of those contexts are they're about history, yes, but they're also about the location

1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:15.720
 of where you are.

1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:20.360
 They're about the larger group of people who around you, whether you're in Athens, Georgia

1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:24.600
 and you're basically the only thing that's there as a university, you're responsible

1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:29.080
 for all the jobs or whether you're at Georgia State University, which is an urban campus,

1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:33.400
 where you're surrounded by six million people and your campus, where it ends and begins

1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:35.840
 in the city, ends and begins, we don't know.

1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:37.800
 It actually matters whether you're a small campus or a large campus.

1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:38.960
 I mean, these things matter.

1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:44.920
 Why is it that if you go to Georgia Tech, you're forever proud of that?

1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:49.520
 Can you say that to people at dinner, like bars and whatever?

1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:57.840
 And if you get a degree at an online university somewhere, that's not a thing that comes up

1:14:57.840 --> 1:14:58.840
 at a bar.

1:14:58.840 --> 1:14:59.840
 Well, it's funny you say that.

1:14:59.840 --> 1:15:06.800
 So the students who take our online masters by several measures are more loyal than the

1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:09.360
 students who come on campus, certainly for the master's degree.

1:15:09.360 --> 1:15:13.320
 The reason for that, I think, and you'd have to ask them, but based on my conversations

1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:17.720
 with them, I feel comfortable saying this, is because this didn't exist before.

1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:22.120
 I mean, we talk about this online masters and that it's reaching 11,000 students and

1:15:22.120 --> 1:15:23.120
 that's an amazing thing.

1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:25.000
 And we're admitting everyone we believe who can succeed.

1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:26.680
 We've got a 60% acceptance rate.

1:15:26.680 --> 1:15:27.680
 It's amazing, right?

1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:29.680
 It's also a $6,600 degree.

1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:34.840
 The entire degree costs $6,600 or $7,000, depending on how long you take, a dollar degree as opposed

1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:37.960
 to $46,000 and cost you to come on campus.

1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:42.040
 So that feels, and I can do it while I'm working full time and I've got a family and a mortgage

1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:43.440
 and all these other things.

1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:47.680
 So it's an opportunity to do something you wanted to do, but you didn't think was possible

1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:51.880
 without giving up two years of your life as well as all the money and everything else,

1:15:51.880 --> 1:15:53.240
 the life that you had built.

1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:58.400
 So I think we created something that's had an impact, but importantly, we gave a set

1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:00.840
 of people opportunities they otherwise didn't feel they had.

1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:02.880
 So I think people feel very loyal about that.

1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:06.800
 And my biggest piece of evidence for that besides the surveys is that we have somewhere

1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:14.360
 north of 80 students, might be 100 at this point, who graduated, but come back in TA

1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:18.120
 for this class for basically minimum wage, even though they're working full time because

1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:23.400
 they believe in sort of having that opportunity and they want to be a part of something.

1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:27.800
 Now will generation three feel this way, 15 years from now, will people have that same

1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:28.800
 sense?

1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:29.800
 I don't know.

1:16:29.800 --> 1:16:31.200
 But right now, they kind of do.

1:16:31.200 --> 1:16:35.880
 And so it's not the online, it's a matter of feeling as if you're a part of something,

1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:36.880
 right?

1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:39.120
 We're all very tribal, right?

1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:44.400
 And I think there's something very tribal about being a part of something like that.

1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:46.040
 Being on campus makes that easier.

1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:48.360
 Going through a shared experience makes that easier.

1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:52.080
 It's harder to have that shared experience if you're alone looking at a computer screen.

1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:53.400
 We can create ways to make that.

1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:54.400
 Is it possible?

1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:55.400
 It is possible.

1:16:55.400 --> 1:17:00.160
 The question is, it still is the intuition to me, and it was at the beginning when I

1:17:00.160 --> 1:17:07.320
 saw something like the online master's program is that this is going to replace universities.

1:17:07.320 --> 1:17:09.600
 And I won't replace universities, but it will.

1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:10.600
 But where is it?

1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:11.600
 Why?

1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:13.960
 Because it's living in a different part of the ecosystem, right?

1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:16.120
 The people who are taking it are already adults.

1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:18.720
 They've gone through their undergrad experience.

1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:21.960
 I think their goals have shifted from when they were 17.

1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:23.600
 They have other things that are going.

1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:27.720
 But it does do something really important, something very social and very important,

1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:28.720
 right?

1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:31.960
 I know this whole thing about, you know, don't build the sidewalks, just leave the grass

1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:35.400
 and the students or the people will walk and you put the sidewalks where they create paths.

1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:37.760
 This is kind of a thing.

1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:40.880
 Their architects, apparently, believe that's the right way to do things.

1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:45.320
 The metaphor here is that we created this environment.

1:17:45.320 --> 1:17:49.480
 We didn't quite know how to think about the social aspect, but, you know, we didn't have

1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:53.160
 time to solve all, do all the social engineering, right?

1:17:53.160 --> 1:17:54.240
 The students did it themselves.

1:17:54.240 --> 1:17:57.640
 They created, you know, these groups.

1:17:57.640 --> 1:18:02.160
 Like on Google Plus, they were like 30 something groups created in the first year because somebody

1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:04.400
 had these Google Plus.

1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:07.400
 And they created these groups and they divided up in ways that made sense.

1:18:07.400 --> 1:18:08.400
 We live in the same state.

1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:09.400
 We're working on the same things.

1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:10.720
 We have the same background or whatever.

1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:12.080
 And they created these social things.

1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:16.680
 We sent them t shirts and they were, we have all these great pictures of students putting

1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:18.360
 on their t shirts as they travel around the world.

1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:19.360
 I climbed to this mountain top.

1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:20.360
 I'm putting this t shirt on.

1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:21.360
 I'm a part of this.

1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:22.360
 They were a part of them.

1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:26.640
 They created the social environment on top of the social network and the social media

1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:30.520
 that existed to create this sense of belonging and being a part of something.

1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:32.960
 They found a way to do it, right?

1:18:32.960 --> 1:18:39.040
 And I think they had other, it scratched an itch that they had, but they had scratched

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:42.600
 some of that itch that might have required they be physically in the same place long

1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:44.480
 before, right?

1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:49.720
 So I think, yes, it's possible and it's more than possible it's necessary.

1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:55.200
 But I don't think it's going to replace the university as we know it.

1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:59.440
 The university as we know it will change, but there's just a lot of power in the kind

1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:01.520
 of rite of passage and kind of going off to yourself.

1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:05.160
 Now maybe there'll be some other rite of passage that'll happen, that'll drive us somewhere

1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:06.160
 else.

1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:07.160
 You can separate.

1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:11.320
 So the university is such a fascinating mess of things.

1:19:11.320 --> 1:19:14.720
 So just even the faculty position is a fascinating mess.

1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:16.480
 Like it doesn't make any sense.

1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:24.480
 It stabilized itself, but like why are the world class researchers spending a huge amount

1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:31.520
 of time or their time teaching and service, like you're doing like three jobs.

1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:35.720
 And I mean, it turns out it's maybe an accident of history or human evolution.

1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:36.720
 I don't know.

1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:40.520
 It seems like the people who are really good at teaching are often really good at research.

1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:44.720
 There seems to be a parallel there, but like it doesn't make any sense that you should

1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:45.720
 be doing that.

1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:53.880
 At the same time, it also doesn't seem to make sense that your place where you party

1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:59.520
 is the same place where you go to learn calculus or whatever, but it's a safe space.

1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:00.520
 Safe space for everything.

1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:01.520
 Yeah.

1:20:01.520 --> 1:20:02.520
 Relatively speaking, it's a safe space.

1:20:02.520 --> 1:20:07.480
 No, by the way, I feel the need very strongly to point out that we are living in a very

1:20:07.480 --> 1:20:09.760
 particular weird bubble, right?

1:20:09.760 --> 1:20:10.960
 Most people don't go to college.

1:20:10.960 --> 1:20:14.400
 And by the way, the ones who do go to college, they're not 18 years old, right?

1:20:14.400 --> 1:20:15.400
 They're like 25 or something.

1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:16.400
 I forget the numbers.

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:22.400
 You know, the places where we've been, where we are, they look like whatever we think the

1:20:22.400 --> 1:20:27.120
 traditional movie version of universities are, but for most people, it's not that way

1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:28.120
 at all.

1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:32.400
 By the way, most people who drop out of college, it's entirely for financial reasons, right?

1:20:32.400 --> 1:20:37.080
 So you know, we were talking about a particular experience.

1:20:37.080 --> 1:20:42.920
 And so for that set of people, which is very small, but larger than it was a decade or

1:20:42.920 --> 1:20:47.280
 two or three or four, certainly, ago, I don't think that will change.

1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:52.400
 My concern, which I think is kind of implicit in some of these questions, is that somehow

1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:57.080
 we will divide the world up further into the people who get to have this experience and

1:20:57.080 --> 1:21:01.280
 get to have the network, and they sort of benefit from it and everyone else, while increasingly

1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:05.960
 requiring that they have more and more credentials in order to get a job as a barista, right?

1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:09.400
 You got to have a master's degree in order to work at Starbucks, and we're going to force

1:21:09.400 --> 1:21:12.520
 people to do these things, but they're not going to get to have that experience.

1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:15.320
 And there'll be a small group of people who do, who will continue to, you know, positive

1:21:15.320 --> 1:21:16.320
 feedback, etc., etc.

1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:22.080
 I worry a lot about that, which is why, for me, and by the way, here's an answer to your

1:21:22.080 --> 1:21:25.960
 question about faculty, which is why to me that you have to focus on access and the mission.

1:21:25.960 --> 1:21:29.840
 I think the reason, whether it's good, bad, or strange, I mean, I agree it's strange,

1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:34.000
 but I think it's useful to have the faculty member, particularly at large R1 universities,

1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:42.200
 where we've all had experiences, that you tie what they get to do and with the fundamental

1:21:42.200 --> 1:21:45.160
 mission of the university and let the mission drive.

1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:49.520
 What I hear when I talk to faculty is they love their PhD students because they're creating,

1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:53.800
 they're reproducing, basically, right, and it lets them do their research and multiply.

1:21:53.800 --> 1:21:58.720
 But they understand that the mission is the undergrads, and so they will do it without

1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:02.680
 complaint, mostly, because it's a part of the mission and why they're here, and they

1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:06.640
 have experiences with it themselves, and that it was important to get them where they were

1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:07.640
 going.

1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:10.440
 The people who tend to get squeezed in that, by the way, are the master's students, right,

1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:13.520
 who are neither the PhDs who are like us nor the undergrads.

1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:17.480
 We have already bought into the idea that we have to teach, though, that's increasingly

1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:18.480
 changing.

1:22:18.480 --> 1:22:23.200
 Anyway, I think tying that mission in really matters, and it gives you a way to unify people

1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:26.640
 around making it an actual higher calling.

1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:31.520
 Education feels like more of a higher calling to me than even research, because education,

1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:35.240
 you cannot treat it as a hobby if you're going to do it well.

1:22:35.240 --> 1:22:42.240
 But that's the pushback on this whole system, is that you should, education be a full time

1:22:42.240 --> 1:22:48.520
 job, right, and almost like research is a distraction from that.

1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:53.880
 Yes, although I think many of our colleagues would say that research is the job and education

1:22:53.880 --> 1:22:55.040
 is the distraction.

1:22:55.040 --> 1:22:56.640
 Right, but that's the beautiful dance.

1:22:56.640 --> 1:23:05.040
 It seems to be that tension in itself seems to work, seems to bring out the best in the

1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:06.040
 faculty.

1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:08.440
 But I will point out two things.

1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:10.840
 One thing I'm going to point out, and the other thing I want Michael to point out, because

1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:16.640
 I think Michael is much closer to the sort of the ideal professor in some sense than

1:23:16.640 --> 1:23:17.640
 I am.

1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:18.640
 Well, he is a dean.

1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:19.640
 You're the platonic sense of a professor.

1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:23.320
 Yeah, I don't know what he meant by that, but he is a dean, so he has a different experience.

1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:28.040
 I'm giving him time to think of the profound thing he's going to say, but let me point

1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:34.080
 this out, which is that we have lecturers in the College of Computing where I am.

1:23:34.080 --> 1:23:37.880
 There's 10 or 12 of them, depending on how you count, as opposed to the 90 or so tenure

1:23:37.880 --> 1:23:42.000
 track faculty, those 10 lecturers who only teach, well, they don't only teach, they

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:43.000
 also do service.

1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:46.600
 Some of them do research as well, but primarily they teach.

1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:51.320
 They teach 50%, over 50% of our credit hours, and we teach everybody.

1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:57.480
 So they're doing not just, they're doing more than eight times the work of the tenure track

1:23:57.480 --> 1:24:01.680
 faculty, but just if you're closer to nine or 10.

1:24:01.680 --> 1:24:03.120
 And that's including our grad courses.

1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:07.640
 So they're doing this, they're teaching more, they're touching more than anyone, and they're

1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:08.640
 beloved for it.

1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:12.880
 I mean, so we recently had a survey, we do these, everyone does these alumni surveys,

1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:15.880
 you hire someone from the outside to do whatever, and I was really struck by something.

1:24:15.880 --> 1:24:17.360
 You saw these really cool numbers.

1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:19.960
 I'm not going to talk about it because it's all internal, confidential stuff.

1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:23.280
 But one thing I will talk about is there was a single question we asked our alum, and these

1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:27.120
 are people who graduated, born in the 30s and 40s, all the way up to people who graduated

1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:28.440
 last week, right?

1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:30.720
 Well, last semester.

1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:31.720
 Okay, good.

1:24:31.720 --> 1:24:32.720
 Time flies.

1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:34.960
 Yeah, time flies.

1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:36.640
 And there was a question.

1:24:36.640 --> 1:24:42.000
 Name this a single person who had a strong positive impact on you, something like that.

1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.320
 I think it was special impact?

1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:45.720
 Yeah, special impact on you.

1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:48.520
 And then so they got all the answers from people and they created a word cloud.

1:24:48.520 --> 1:24:52.320
 There was clear word cloud created by people who don't do word clouds for a living because

1:24:52.320 --> 1:24:57.400
 they had one person whose name like appeared like nine different times like Phillip, Phil,

1:24:57.400 --> 1:24:59.440
 Dr. Phil, you know, but whatever.

1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:02.400
 But they got all this and I looked at it and I noticed something really cool.

1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:09.720
 The five people from the college of computing I recognized were in that cloud.

1:25:09.720 --> 1:25:15.320
 And four of them were lecturers, the people who teach.

1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:17.480
 Two of them relatively modern.

1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:19.960
 Both were chairs of our division of computing instruction.

1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:22.440
 One just one retired, one is going to retire soon.

1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:26.600
 And the other two were lecturers I remembered from the 1980s.

1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:27.600
 Two of those four.

1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:29.840
 Just by the way, the fifth person was Charles.

1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:30.840
 That's not important.

1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:35.480
 I don't tell people that, but the two of those people are teaching awards are named

1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:36.480
 after.

1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:37.480
 Thank you, Michael.

1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:39.760
 Two of those are teaching awards are named after, right?

1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:44.560
 So when you ask students, alumni, people who are now 60, 70 years old even, you know, who

1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:45.560
 touch them?

1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:46.720
 They say the dean of students.

1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:50.240
 They say the big teachers who taught the big introductory classes, they got me into it.

1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:55.760
 There's a guy named Richard Barker's on there who's known as a great teacher.

1:25:55.760 --> 1:26:00.080
 The Phil Adler guy who I probably just said his last name wrong.

1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:02.800
 I know the first name's Phil because it kept showing up over and over again.

1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:04.520
 It says Adler is what it said.

1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:05.520
 Okay, good.

1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:06.800
 But different people spelled it differently.

1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:08.320
 So he appeared multiple times.

1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:09.320
 Right.

1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:14.360
 So he was clearly, he was a professor in the business school.

1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:17.800
 But when you read about him, I went to read about it because I was curious who he was.

1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:20.160
 It's all about his teaching and the students that he touched, right?

1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:23.960
 So whatever it is that we're doing and we think we're doing that's important or why we think

1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:28.680
 the university's function, the people who go through it, they remember the people who

1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:31.480
 were kind to them, the people who taught them something.

1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:32.480
 And they do remember it.

1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:33.480
 They remember it later.

1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:37.240
 I think that's important and so the mission matters.

1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:38.240
 Yeah.

1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:46.120
 Not to completely lose track of the fundamental problem of how do we replace the party aspect

1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:47.120
 of universities.

1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:48.120
 That's right.

1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:57.080
 Before we go to what makes the Platonic professor, do you think like what in your sense is the

1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:00.560
 role of MOOCs in this whole picture during COVID?

1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:07.280
 Like should we desperately be clamoring to get back on campus or is this a stable place

1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:08.840
 to be for a little while?

1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:09.840
 I don't know.

1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:15.880
 I know that it's the online teaching experience and learning experience has been really rough.

1:27:15.880 --> 1:27:22.160
 I think that people find it to be a struggle in a way that's not a happy positive struggle.

1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:25.840
 That when you got through it, you just feel like glad that it's over as opposed to I've

1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:27.920
 achieved something.

1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:29.760
 So I worry about that.

1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:36.800
 But I worry about just even before this happened, I worry about lecture teaching as how well

1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:42.440
 is that actually really working as far as a way to do education, as a way to inspire

1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:43.440
 people.

1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:48.240
 I mean, all the data that I am aware of seems to indicate, and this kind of fits I think

1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:54.520
 with Charles's story, is that people respond to connection.

1:27:54.520 --> 1:27:59.240
 They actually feel, if they feel connected to the person teaching the class, they're

1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:01.160
 more likely to go along with it.

1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:03.040
 They're more able to retain information.

1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:08.000
 They're more motivated to be involved in the class in some way.

1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.160
 And that really matters.

1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:12.720
 You mean to the human themselves.

1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:18.440
 So can't you do that actually perhaps more effectively online?

1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:20.360
 Like you mentioned science communication.

1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:27.920
 So I literally, I think, learned linear algebra from Gilbert Strang by watching MIT Open Course

1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:29.960
 Wear when I was in drugs.

1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:34.800
 And he was a personality, he was a bit like a tiny, in this tiny little world of math,

1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:36.640
 there's a bit of a rock star, right?

1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:40.960
 So you kind of look up to that person.

1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:44.960
 Can't that replace the in person education?

1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:45.960
 It can help.

1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:46.960
 I will point out something.

1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:51.360
 I'll share the numbers, but we have surveyed our students, and even though they have feelings

1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:56.960
 about what I would interpret as connection, I like that word, in the different modes of

1:28:56.960 --> 1:29:02.640
 classrooms, there's no difference between how well they think they're learning.

1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:07.080
 For them, the thing that makes them unhappy is the situation they're in.

1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:10.600
 And I think the last lack of connection, it's not whether they're learning anything.

1:29:10.600 --> 1:29:13.560
 They seem to think they're learning something anyway, right?

1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:19.200
 In fact, they seem to think they're learning it equally well, presumably because the faculty

1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:25.840
 are putting in, or the instructors, more generally speaking, are putting in the energy and effort

1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:30.760
 to try to make certain that what they've curated can be expressed to them in a useful way.

1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:31.880
 But the connection is missing.

1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:33.960
 And so there's huge differences in what they prefer.

1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:37.480
 And as far as I can tell, what they prefer is more connection, not less.

1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:40.120
 That connection just doesn't have to be physically in a classroom.

1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:44.840
 I mean, look, I used to teach 348 students on a machine learning class on campus.

1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:45.840
 Do you know why?

1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:48.880
 That was the biggest classroom on campus.

1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:49.880
 They're sitting in a theater.

1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:50.880
 They're sitting in theater seats.

1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:56.760
 I'm literally on a stage looking down on them and talking to them, right?

1:29:56.760 --> 1:30:01.600
 There's no, I mean, we're not sitting down having a one on one conversation, reading

1:30:01.600 --> 1:30:05.480
 each other's body language, trying to communicate and going, we're not doing any of that.

1:30:05.480 --> 1:30:09.520
 So if you're past the third row, it might as well be on any way is the kind of thing

1:30:09.520 --> 1:30:10.520
 that people said.

1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:14.920
 Daphne has actually said some version of this, that online starts on the third row or something

1:30:14.920 --> 1:30:15.920
 like that.

1:30:15.920 --> 1:30:20.400
 And I think that's not, yeah, I like it, I think it captures something important.

1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:23.920
 But people still came, by the way, even the people who had access to our material would

1:30:23.920 --> 1:30:24.920
 still come to class.

1:30:24.920 --> 1:30:29.200
 I mean, there's a certain element about looking to the person next to you and just like their

1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:35.840
 presence there, their boredom and like when the parts are boring and their excitement

1:30:35.840 --> 1:30:43.800
 when the parts are exciting and sharing in that like unspoken kind of, yeah, communication.

1:30:43.800 --> 1:30:46.960
 In part, the connection is with the other people in the room.

1:30:46.960 --> 1:30:53.600
 Watching the circus on TV alone is not really, they've ever been to a movie theater and been

1:30:53.600 --> 1:30:55.440
 the only one there at a comedy.

1:30:55.440 --> 1:31:00.120
 It's not as funny as when you're in a room full of people all laughing.

1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:05.200
 Well, you need, maybe you need just another person, it's like, as opposed to many, maybe

1:31:05.200 --> 1:31:06.200
 there's some kind of...

1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:07.880
 Well, there's different kinds of connection, right?

1:31:07.880 --> 1:31:10.480
 And there's different kinds of comedy.

1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:12.560
 Well, in the sense that...

1:31:12.560 --> 1:31:14.960
 As we're learning today.

1:31:14.960 --> 1:31:21.760
 I wasn't sure if that was going to land, but just the idea that different jokes, I've

1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:23.160
 now done a little bit of stand up.

1:31:23.160 --> 1:31:28.680
 And so different jokes work in different sized crowds too, right, where sometimes if it's

1:31:28.680 --> 1:31:33.920
 a big enough crowd, then even a really subtle joke can take root someplace and then that

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:36.400
 cues other people and it kind of...

1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:40.240
 There's a whole statistics of, I did this terrible thing to my brother.

1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:45.400
 So when I was really young, I decided that my brother was only laughing at sitcoms when

1:31:45.400 --> 1:31:46.400
 I laughed.

1:31:46.400 --> 1:31:48.240
 Like he was taking cues from me.

1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:51.080
 So I like purposely didn't laugh just to see if I was right.

1:31:51.080 --> 1:31:52.240
 And did you laugh at non funny things?

1:31:52.240 --> 1:31:53.240
 Yes.

1:31:53.240 --> 1:31:54.240
 You really want to do both sides.

1:31:54.240 --> 1:31:55.240
 I did both sides.

1:31:55.240 --> 1:31:58.160
 And at the end of it, I told him what I did.

1:31:58.160 --> 1:32:00.200
 He was very upset about this.

1:32:00.200 --> 1:32:02.080
 And from that day on.

1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:03.080
 He lost his sense of humor.

1:32:03.080 --> 1:32:04.080
 No, no, no, no.

1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:05.080
 Well, yes.

1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:07.680
 But from that day on, he laughed on his own.

1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:08.880
 He stopped taking cues from me.

1:32:08.880 --> 1:32:09.880
 I see.

1:32:09.880 --> 1:32:11.880
 So I want to say that it was a good thing that I did.

1:32:11.880 --> 1:32:12.880
 Yes, yes.

1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:13.880
 You saved that man's life.

1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:14.880
 Yes.

1:32:14.880 --> 1:32:15.880
 But it was mostly mean.

1:32:15.880 --> 1:32:16.880
 But it's true though.

1:32:16.880 --> 1:32:17.880
 It's true, right?

1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:18.880
 That people...

1:32:18.880 --> 1:32:19.880
 I think you're right.

1:32:19.880 --> 1:32:20.880
 But okay.

1:32:20.880 --> 1:32:21.880
 So where does that get us?

1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:22.880
 That gets us the idea that...

1:32:22.880 --> 1:32:26.320
 I mean, certainly movie theaters are a thing, right?

1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:30.960
 Where people like to be watching together, even though the people on the screen aren't

1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:35.040
 really co present with the people in the audience, the audience is co present with themselves.

1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:39.480
 By the way, and that point, it's an open question that's being raised by this, whether movies

1:32:39.480 --> 1:32:43.760
 will no longer be a thing because Netflix's audience is growing.

1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:44.760
 So that's...

1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:47.240
 It's a very parallel question for education.

1:32:47.240 --> 1:32:50.080
 Will movie theaters still be a thing in 2021?

1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:55.360
 No, but I think the argument is that there is a feeling of being in the crowd that isn't

1:32:55.360 --> 1:32:59.400
 replicated by being at home, watching it, and that there's value in that.

1:32:59.400 --> 1:33:01.600
 And then I think just...

1:33:01.600 --> 1:33:02.600
 But...

1:33:02.600 --> 1:33:03.600
 It scales better online.

1:33:03.600 --> 1:33:10.520
 But I feel like we're having a conversation about whether concerts will still exist after

1:33:10.520 --> 1:33:14.120
 the invention of the record or the CD or wherever it is, right?

1:33:14.120 --> 1:33:15.120
 They won't.

1:33:15.120 --> 1:33:16.120
 You're right.

1:33:16.120 --> 1:33:17.120
 Concerts are dead.

1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:18.120
 Well, okay.

1:33:18.120 --> 1:33:21.760
 I think the joke is only funny if you say it before and now.

1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:22.760
 Right, yeah.

1:33:22.760 --> 1:33:23.760
 That's true.

1:33:23.760 --> 1:33:24.760
 We'll fix it in person.

1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:25.760
 Like three years ago.

1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:26.760
 It's like, well, no, obviously, concerts are still...

1:33:26.760 --> 1:33:28.760
 I'll wait to publish this until we have a vaccine.

1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:30.440
 We'll fix it in post.

1:33:30.440 --> 1:33:33.240
 But I think the important thing is...

1:33:33.240 --> 1:33:34.880
 Fix the virus, Bust.

1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:35.880
 Concerts changed.

1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:36.880
 Right?

1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:37.880
 Concerts changed.

1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:39.600
 First off, movie theaters weren't this way, right?

1:33:39.600 --> 1:33:42.040
 In like the 60s and 70s, they weren't like this.

1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:44.080
 Like blockbusters were basically what?

1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:47.200
 What Jaws and Star Wars created blockbusters, right?

1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:48.200
 Before then, there weren't.

1:33:48.200 --> 1:33:52.120
 Like the whole shared summer experience didn't exist in our lifetimes, right?

1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:53.120
 Yeah.

1:33:53.120 --> 1:33:55.040
 Certainly, you were well into adulthood by the time this was true, right?

1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:56.640
 So it's just a very different...

1:33:56.640 --> 1:33:57.640
 It's very different.

1:33:57.640 --> 1:34:01.160
 And what we've been experiencing in the last 10 years is not like the majority of human

1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:03.960
 history, but more importantly, concerts, right?

1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:04.960
 Concerts mean something different.

1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:07.760
 Most people don't go to concerts anymore.

1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:09.680
 Like there's an age where you care about it.

1:34:09.680 --> 1:34:10.680
 You sort of stop doing it.

1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:13.880
 You keep listening to music or whatever and da, da, da, da, da, da.

1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:22.640
 So I think that's a painful way of saying that it will change.

1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:24.200
 It's not the same thing as it going away.

1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:27.080
 Replace is too strong of a word, but it will change.

1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:28.080
 It has to.

1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:29.080
 I actually...

1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:32.800
 To push back, I wonder because I think you're probably just throwing that your intuition

1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:33.800
 out.

1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:34.800
 Oh, absolutely.

1:34:34.800 --> 1:34:37.600
 And it's possible that concerts...

1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:42.920
 More people go to concerts now, but obviously much more people listen to...

1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:44.640
 Well, that's dumb.

1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:47.800
 Then before there was records.

1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:53.640
 It's possible to argue that, if you look at the data, that it just expanded the pie of

1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:55.640
 what music listening means.

1:34:55.640 --> 1:35:01.160
 So it's possible that universities grow in the parallel or the theaters grow, but also

1:35:01.160 --> 1:35:06.120
 more people get to watch movies, more people get to be educated.

1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:07.120
 I hope that.

1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:08.120
 Yeah.

1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:11.480
 And to the extent that we can grow the pie and have education be not just something

1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:17.400
 you do for four years when you're done with your other education, but it would be a more

1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:22.880
 lifelong thing, that would have tremendous benefits, especially as the economy and the

1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:24.680
 world change rapidly.

1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:29.000
 People need opportunities to stay abreast of these changes.

1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:33.520
 And so, I don't know, that's all part of the ecosystem.

1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:34.520
 It's all to the good.

1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:39.240
 I mean, I'm not going to have an argument about whether we lost fidelity when we went

1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:42.760
 from Laserdist to DVDs or record players to CDs.

1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:49.680
 I mean, I'm willing to grant that that is true, but convenience matters and the ability

1:35:49.680 --> 1:35:53.920
 to do something that you couldn't do otherwise because that convenience matters.

1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:57.360
 And you can tell me I'm only getting 90% of the experience, but I'm getting the experience.

1:35:57.360 --> 1:36:00.800
 I wasn't getting it before or wasn't lasting as long or it wasn't as easy.

1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:03.800
 I mean, this just seems, this just seems straightforward to me.

1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:05.600
 It's going to change.

1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:08.480
 It is for the good that more people get access.

1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:13.560
 And it is our job to do two separate things, one, to educate them and make access available.

1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:14.800
 That's our mission.

1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:18.200
 But also, for very simple selfish reasons, we need to figure out how to do it better

1:36:18.200 --> 1:36:20.240
 so that we individually stay in business.

1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:21.920
 We can do both of those things at the same time.

1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:28.120
 They are not in, they may be intention, but they are not mutually exclusive.

1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:33.200
 So you've educated some scary number of people.

1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:39.640
 So you've seen a lot of people succeed, find their path to life.

1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:49.480
 Is there a device that you can give to a young person today about computer science education,

1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:59.520
 about education in general, about life, about whatever the journey that one takes in their,

1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:05.360
 maybe in their teens, in their early 20s, sort of in those underground years as you

1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:11.320
 try to go through the essential process of partying and not go into classes and yet somehow

1:37:11.320 --> 1:37:13.040
 try to get a degree?

1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:19.320
 If you get to the point where you're far enough up in the hierarchy of needs that you

1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:24.440
 can actually make decisions like this, then find the thing that you're passionate about

1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:25.800
 and pursue it.

1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:29.320
 And sometimes it's the thing that drives your life and sometimes it's secondary.

1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:31.680
 And you'll do other things because you've got to eat, right?

1:37:31.680 --> 1:37:34.560
 You've got a family, you've got to feed, you've got people you have to help or whatever.

1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:36.560
 And I understand that and it's not easy for everyone.

1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:44.080
 But always take a moment or two to pursue the things that you love, the things that bring

1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:45.480
 passion and happiness to your life.

1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:48.240
 And if you don't, I know that sounds corny, but I genuinely believe it.

1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:51.440
 And if you don't have such a thing, then you're lying to yourself.

1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:52.440
 You have such a thing.

1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:53.520
 You just have to find it.

1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:56.000
 And it's okay if it takes you a long time to get there.

1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:01.880
 Rodney Dangerfield became a comedian in his 50s, I think, certainly wasn't his 20s.

1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:06.720
 And lots of people failed for a very long time before getting to where they were going.

1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:08.640
 I try to have hope.

1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:09.760
 And it wasn't obvious.

1:38:09.760 --> 1:38:16.640
 I mean, you and I talked about the experience that I had a long time ago with a particular

1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:17.640
 police officer.

1:38:17.640 --> 1:38:18.640
 It wasn't my first one.

1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:21.080
 It wasn't my last one.

1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:25.000
 But in my view, I wasn't supposed to be here after that and I'm here.

1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:26.000
 So it's all gravy.

1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:30.000
 So you might as well go ahead and grab life as you can because of that.

1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:31.320
 That's sort of how I see it.

1:38:31.320 --> 1:38:34.600
 While recognizing, again, the delusion matters, right?

1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:36.000
 Allow yourself to be deluded.

1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.200
 Allow yourself to believe that it's all going to work out.

1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:43.560
 Just don't be so deluded that you miss the obvious and you're going to be fine.

1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:44.560
 It's going to be there.

1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:45.560
 It's going to be there.

1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:46.560
 It's going to work out.

1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:47.920
 What do you think?

1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:53.840
 I like to say, choose your parents wisely because that has a big impact on your life.

1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:54.840
 Yeah.

1:38:54.840 --> 1:39:00.360
 I mean, there's a whole lot of things that you don't get to pick and whether you get

1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:05.520
 to have one kind of life or a different kind of life can depend a lot on things out of

1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:06.920
 your control.

1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:10.320
 But I really do believe in the passion and excitement thing.

1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:17.800
 I was talking to my mom on the phone the other day and essentially what came out is that

1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:25.760
 computer science is really popular right now and I get to be a professor teaching something

1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:29.200
 that's very attractive to people.

1:39:29.200 --> 1:39:36.800
 And she was like trying to give me some appreciation for how foresightful I was for choosing this

1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:42.240
 line of work as if somehow I knew that this is what was going to happen in 2020.

1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:44.320
 But that's not how it went for me at all.

1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:47.880
 I studied computer science because I was just interested.

1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:51.520
 It was just so interesting to me.

1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:54.680
 I didn't think it would be particularly lucrative.

1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:59.640
 And I've done everything I can to keep it as lucrative as possible.

1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:05.040
 Some of my friends and colleagues have not done that and I pride myself on my ability

1:40:05.040 --> 1:40:10.600
 to remain unrich.

1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:14.720
 But I do believe that I'm glad that it worked out for me.

1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:19.160
 It could have been like, oh, what I was really fascinated by is this particular kind of engraving

1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:20.800
 that nobody cares about.

1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:24.040
 But so I got lucky and the thing that I cared about happened to be a thing that other people

1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:26.400
 eventually cared about.

1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:29.440
 But I don't think I would have had a fun time choosing anything else.

1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:32.960
 This was the thing that kept me interested and engaged.

1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:40.160
 One thing that people tell me especially around early on the graduate and the internet is part

1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:44.920
 of the problem here is they say they're passionate about so many things.

1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:46.640
 How do I choose a thing?

1:40:46.640 --> 1:40:50.280
 Which is a harder thing for me to know what to do with.

1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:51.280
 Is there any?

1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:57.280
 I mean, don't even know which, I mean, you know, look, a long time ago I walked down

1:40:57.280 --> 1:40:58.960
 the hallway and I took a left turn.

1:40:58.960 --> 1:40:59.960
 Yeah.

1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:00.960
 I could have taken a right turn.

1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:03.760
 And my world could be better or it could be worse.

1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:04.760
 I have no idea.

1:41:04.760 --> 1:41:05.760
 I have no way of knowing.

1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:08.760
 Is there anything about this particular hallway that's relevant or are you just in general

1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:09.760
 choices?

1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:10.760
 Yeah, you were on the left.

1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:11.760
 It sounds like you regret not taking the right turn.

1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:12.760
 Oh, no, not at all.

1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:13.760
 You brought it up.

1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:16.560
 Well, because it was a turn there.

1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:18.080
 On the left was Michael Liman's office, right?

1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:20.160
 I mean, these sorts of things happen, right?

1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:21.160
 But here's the thing.

1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:23.160
 On the right, by the way, it was just a blank wall.

1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:24.480
 It wasn't a huge choice.

1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:25.480
 It would have really hurt.

1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:26.480
 He tried first.

1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:27.880
 No, but it's true, right?

1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:30.280
 You know, I think about Ron Brockman, right?

1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:38.040
 I went, I took a trip I wasn't supposed to take and I ended up talking to Ron about this

1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:43.000
 and I ended up going down this entire path that allowed me to, I think, get tenure.

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:47.160
 But by the way, I decided to say yes to something that didn't make any sense and I went down

1:41:47.160 --> 1:41:48.160
 this educational path.

1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:50.720
 But it would have been, you know, who knows, right?

1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:54.320
 Maybe if I hadn't done that, I would be a billionaire right now.

1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:55.320
 I'd be Elon Musk.

1:41:55.320 --> 1:41:57.080
 My life could be so much better.

1:41:57.080 --> 1:41:59.600
 My life could also be so much worse.

1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:03.080
 You know, you just got to feel that sometimes you have decisions you're going to make.

1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:04.240
 You cannot know what's going to do.

1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:05.760
 You should think about it, right?

1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:07.520
 Some things are clearly smarter than other things.

1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:09.760
 You got to play the odds a little bit.

1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:12.880
 But in the end, if you've got multiple choices or lots of things you think you might love,

1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:16.440
 go with the thing that you actually love, the thing that jumps out at you and sort of pursue

1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:17.440
 it for a little while.

1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:20.240
 The worst thing that'll happen is you took a left turn instead of a right turn and you

1:42:20.240 --> 1:42:21.720
 ended up merely happy.

1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:22.720
 Beautiful.

1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:29.800
 So, so accepting, so taking the step and just accepting that that don't like question,

1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:30.800
 question the choice.

1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:36.840
 I like to think that life is long and there's time to actually pursue.

1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:43.440
 Every once in a while, you have to put on a leather suit and make a thriller video.

1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:44.440
 Every once in a while.

1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:45.440
 Every once in a while.

1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:49.040
 If I ever get a chance again, I'm doing it.

1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:53.240
 I was told that you actually dance, but that part was edited out.

1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:55.880
 I don't dance.

1:42:55.880 --> 1:42:59.200
 There was a thing where we did do the zombie thing.

1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:00.200
 We did do the zombie thing.

1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:01.200
 Yeah.

1:43:01.200 --> 1:43:02.200
 That wasn't edited out.

1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:05.440
 It just wasn't put into the final thing.

1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:06.440
 I'm quite happy.

1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:07.640
 There was a reason for that too, right?

1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:09.560
 Like, I wasn't wearing something right.

1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:10.560
 There was a reason for that.

1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:11.560
 I can't remember what it was.

1:43:11.560 --> 1:43:12.560
 No leather suit.

1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:13.560
 Is that what it was?

1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:14.560
 I can't remember.

1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:15.560
 Anyway, the right thing happened.

1:43:15.560 --> 1:43:16.560
 Exactly.

1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:19.640
 You took the left turn and ended up being the right thing.

1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:25.360
 A lot of people ask me that are a little bit tangential to the programming of the computing

1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:30.320
 world and they're interested to learn programming, like all kinds of disciplines that are outside

1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:33.440
 of the particular discipline of computer science.

1:43:33.440 --> 1:43:41.200
 What advice do you have for people that want to learn how to program or want to either taste

1:43:41.200 --> 1:43:47.680
 this little skill set or discipline or try to see if it can be used somehow in their

1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:49.000
 own life?

1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:53.240
 What stage of life are they in?

1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:57.600
 One of the magic things about the internet of the people that write me is I don't know.

1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:00.080
 Because my answer is different.

1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:02.560
 My daughter is taking AP computer science right now.

1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:03.560
 Hi, Johnny.

1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:06.840
 She's amazing and doing amazing things.

1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:10.240
 My son's beginning to get interested and I'll be really curious where he takes it.

1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:14.920
 I think his mind actually works very well for this sort of thing and she's doing great.

1:44:14.920 --> 1:44:18.240
 But one of the things I have to tell her all the time is she points, well, I want to make

1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:20.400
 a rhythm game.

1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:23.960
 I want to go for two weeks and then build a rhythm game, show me how to build a rhythm

1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:24.960
 game.

1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:29.080
 It starts small, learn the building blocks and however you take the time.

1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:30.080
 Have patience.

1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:31.080
 Eventually, you'll build a rhythm game.

1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:36.160
 I was in grad school when I suddenly woke up one day over the Royal East and I thought,

1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:39.800
 wait a minute, I'm a computer scientist, I should be able to write Pac Man in an afternoon.

1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:40.800
 And I did.

1:44:40.800 --> 1:44:41.800
 Not with great graphics.

1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:43.040
 It was actually a very cool game.

1:44:43.040 --> 1:44:46.240
 I had to figure out how the ghost moved and everything and I did it in an afternoon and

1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:50.080
 Pascal on an old Apple 2GS.

1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:54.160
 But if I had started out trying to build Pac Man, I think it probably would have ended

1:44:54.160 --> 1:44:55.160
 very poorly for me.

1:44:55.160 --> 1:45:00.040
 Luckily, back then, there weren't these magical devices we call phones and software everywhere

1:45:00.040 --> 1:45:04.440
 to give me this illusion that I could create something by myself from the basics inside

1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:05.640
 of a weekend like that.

1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:10.560
 I mean, that was a culmination of years and years and years right before I decided I should

1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:12.240
 be able to write this and I could.

1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:17.480
 So my advice if you're early on is you've got the internet, there are lots of people

1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:19.040
 there to give you the information.

1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:20.880
 Find someone who cares about this.

1:45:20.880 --> 1:45:22.800
 Remember they've been doing it for a very long time.

1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:27.040
 Take it slow, learn the little pieces, get excited about it and then keep the big projects

1:45:27.040 --> 1:45:28.600
 you want to build in mind.

1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:33.240
 You'll get there soon enough because as a wise man once said, life is long.

1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:38.240
 Because it doesn't seem that long, but it is long and you'll have enough time to build

1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:39.240
 it all out.

1:45:39.240 --> 1:45:43.560
 All the information is out there, but start small.

1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:44.560
 Generate fibonacci numbers.

1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:47.800
 That's not exciting, but it'll get you programming language.

1:45:47.800 --> 1:45:51.120
 Well, there's only one programming language, it's Lisp.

1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:55.400
 But if you have to pick a programming language, I guess in today's, what would I do?

1:45:55.400 --> 1:45:56.400
 I guess I'd do.

1:45:56.400 --> 1:45:59.880
 Python is basically Lisp, but with better syntax.

1:45:59.880 --> 1:46:01.400
 Blast with me.

1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:02.400
 Yeah.

1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:03.400
 C syntax.

1:46:03.400 --> 1:46:04.400
 How about that?

1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:06.600
 So you're going to argue that C syntax is better than anything?

1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:09.920
 Anyway, also, I'm going to answer Python despite what you said.

1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:14.440
 Tell me, tell your story about somebody's dissertation that had a Lisp program in it.

1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:15.520
 It was so funny.

1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:16.520
 This is Dave's.

1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:20.400
 Dave's dissertation was like Dave McAllister, who was a professor at MIT for a while, and

1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:21.400
 then he came to our lab.

1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:22.400
 In our group.

1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:26.400
 And now he's at Technology Technical Institute in Chicago.

1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:27.400
 A brilliant guy.

1:46:27.400 --> 1:46:29.400
 Such an interesting guy.

1:46:29.400 --> 1:46:34.040
 His thesis, it was a theorem prover.

1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:39.160
 And he decided to have, as an appendix, his actual code, which of course was all written

1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:44.200
 in Lisp, because of course it was, and like the last 20 pages are just write parentheses.

1:46:44.200 --> 1:46:46.200
 It's wonderful.

1:46:46.200 --> 1:46:48.400
 It's like, that's programming right there.

1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:50.920
 I had pages of pages of write parentheses.

1:46:50.920 --> 1:46:54.400
 Anyway, Lisp is the only real language, but I understand that that's not necessarily the

1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:56.360
 place where you start.

1:46:56.360 --> 1:46:57.360
 Python is just fine.

1:46:57.360 --> 1:46:59.120
 Python is good.

1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:03.040
 If you're of a certain age, if you're really young and trying to figure out graphical languages

1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:06.000
 that let you kind of see how the thing works, then that's fine too.

1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:07.000
 They're all fine.

1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:08.000
 It almost doesn't matter.

1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:11.800
 But there are people who spend a lot of time thinking about how to build languages that

1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:12.800
 get people in.

1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:17.160
 The question is, are you trying to get in and figure out what it is, or do you already know

1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:18.160
 what you want?

1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:20.560
 And that's why I asked you what stage of life people are in, because if you're different

1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:23.680
 stages of life, you would attack it differently.

1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:27.880
 The answer to that question of which language keeps changing, I mean, there's some value

1:47:27.880 --> 1:47:33.240
 to exploring, a lot of people write to me about Julia.

1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:39.360
 There's these like more modern languages that keep being invented, Rust and Kotlin.

1:47:39.360 --> 1:47:46.440
 There's stuff that, for people who love functional languages like Lisp, apparently there's echoes

1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:49.880
 of that, but much better in the modern languages.

1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:54.480
 It's worthwhile to, especially when you're learning languages, it feels like it's okay

1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:58.360
 to try one that's not like the popular one.

1:47:58.360 --> 1:47:59.360
 But you want something simple.

1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:05.000
 And I think you get that way of thinking almost no matter what language.

1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:08.840
 And if you push far enough, like it can be assembly language, but you need to push pretty

1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:13.040
 far before you start to hit the really deep concepts that you would get sooner in other

1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:14.040
 languages.

1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:18.440
 But like, I don't know, computation is kind of computation is kind of, touring equivalent

1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:19.600
 is kind of computation.

1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:24.480
 And so, it matters how you express things, but you have to build out that mental structure

1:48:24.480 --> 1:48:25.680
 in your mind.

1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:28.760
 And I don't think it's super matters which language.

1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:32.240
 I mean, it matters a little because some things are just at the wrong level of abstraction.

1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:35.960
 I think assembly is at the wrong level of abstraction for someone coming in new.

1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:37.320
 I think that if you start...

1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:38.520
 For someone coming in new.

1:48:38.520 --> 1:48:39.520
 Yes.

1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:42.160
 For frameworks, big frameworks are quite a bit.

1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:45.280
 You've got to get to the point where I want to learn a new language, which means I just

1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:49.440
 pick up a reference book and I think of a project and I go through it in a weekend.

1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:50.440
 You've got to get there.

1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:51.440
 You're right though.

1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:53.960
 The languages that are designed for that are...

1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:55.040
 It almost doesn't matter.

1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:59.160
 Pick the ones that people have built tutorials and infrastructure around to help you get

1:48:59.160 --> 1:49:00.960
 kind of ease into it.

1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:01.960
 Because it's hard.

1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:05.280
 I mean, I did this little experiment once.

1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:08.720
 I was teaching intro to CS in the summer as a favor.

1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:09.720
 Which is...

1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:10.720
 Anyway.

1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:16.600
 I was teaching intro to CS as a favor and it was very funny because I'd go in every single

1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:21.480
 time and I would think to myself, how am I possibly going to fill up an hour and a half

1:49:21.480 --> 1:49:23.640
 talking about for loops?

1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:24.640
 There wasn't enough time.

1:49:24.640 --> 1:49:26.760
 It took me a while to realize this.

1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:27.960
 There are only three things.

1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:31.840
 There's reading from a variable, writing to a variable, and conditional branching.

1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:34.080
 Everything else is syntactic sugar.

1:49:34.080 --> 1:49:36.840
 The syntactic sugar matters, but that's it.

1:49:36.840 --> 1:49:39.280
 When I say that's it, I don't mean it's simple.

1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:41.000
 It's hard.

1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:45.360
 Conditional branching, loops, variable, those are really hard concepts.

1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:47.320
 You shouldn't be discouraged by this.

1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:48.320
 Here's a simple experiment.

1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:49.520
 I'm going to ask you a question now.

1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:50.920
 You ready?

1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:51.920
 X equals three.

1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:52.920
 Okay.

1:49:52.920 --> 1:49:53.920
 Mm hmm.

1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:54.920
 Y equals four.

1:49:54.920 --> 1:49:55.920
 Okay.

1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:56.920
 What is X?

1:49:56.920 --> 1:49:57.920
 Three.

1:49:57.920 --> 1:49:58.920
 What is Y?

1:49:58.920 --> 1:49:59.920
 Four.

1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:00.920
 Y equals S.

1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:01.920
 I'm going to rest this up.

1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:02.920
 No?

1:50:02.920 --> 1:50:03.920
 Oh, it's easy.

1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:04.920
 Y equals X.

1:50:04.920 --> 1:50:05.920
 Y equals X.

1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:06.920
 What is Y?

1:50:06.920 --> 1:50:07.920
 Three.

1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:09.420
 That's right.

1:50:09.420 --> 1:50:11.480
 X equals seven.

1:50:11.480 --> 1:50:12.680
 What is Y?

1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:17.640
 That's one of the trickiest things to get for programmers, that there's a memory and

1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:22.320
 the variables are pointing to a particular thing in memory, and sometimes the languages

1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:26.400
 hide that from you, and they bring it closer to the way you think mathematics works.

1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:27.400
 Right.

1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:30.600
 So, in fact, Mark Guzdal, who worries about these sorts of things, or used to worry about

1:50:30.600 --> 1:50:36.080
 these sorts of things anyway, had this kind of belief that actually people, when they

1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:40.000
 see these statements, X equals something Y equals something Y equals X, that you have

1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:45.680
 now made a mathematical statement that Y and X are the same.

1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:48.000
 Which you can if you just put like an anchor in front of it.

1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:51.360
 Yes, but people, that's not what you're doing, right?

1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:55.600
 I thought, and I kind of asked the question, and I think I had some evidence for this,

1:50:55.600 --> 1:50:59.760
 I'm hardly studying, is that most of the people who didn't know the answer, weren't sure about

1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:03.560
 the answer, they had used spreadsheets.

1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:11.080
 And so, it's by reference, or by name, really, right?

1:51:11.080 --> 1:51:14.800
 And so, depending upon what you think, they are, you get completely different answers.

1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:20.240
 The fact that I could go, or one could go, two thirds of the way through a semester,

1:51:20.240 --> 1:51:23.960
 and people still hadn't figured out in their heads, when you say Y equals X, what that

1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:29.720
 meant, tells you it's actually hard, because all those answers are possible, and in fact,

1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:32.440
 when you said, oh, if you just put an ampersand in front of it, I mean, that doesn't make

1:51:32.440 --> 1:51:35.280
 any sense for an intro class, and of course, a lot of languages don't even give you the

1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:37.360
 ability to think about it in terms of ampersand.

1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:40.760
 Do we want to have a 45 minute discussion about the difference between equal EQ and

1:51:40.760 --> 1:51:43.040
 equal in Lisp?

1:51:43.040 --> 1:51:44.040
 I know you do.

1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:49.720
 But, you know, you could do that, this is actually really hard stuff, so you shouldn't

1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:54.240
 be, it's not too hard, we all do it, but you shouldn't be discouraged, it's why you

1:51:54.240 --> 1:51:57.320
 should start small, so that you can figure out these things, so you have the right model

1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:01.960
 in your head, so that when you write the language, you can execute it, and build the machine

1:52:01.960 --> 1:52:03.280
 that you want to build, right?

1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:09.000
 Yeah, the funny thing about programming on those very basic things is the very basics

1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:14.560
 are not often made explicit, which is actually what drives everybody away from basically

1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:18.880
 any discipline, but programming is just another one, like even a simpler version of the equal

1:52:18.880 --> 1:52:28.800
 sign that I kind of forget is in mathematics, equals is not assignment, like, I think basically

1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:34.520
 every single programming language with just a few handful of exceptions equals is assignment,

1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:40.880
 and you have some other operator for equality, and, you know, even that, like everyone kind

1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:47.160
 of knows it, once you started doing it, but like, you need to say that explicitly, or

1:52:47.160 --> 1:52:53.960
 you need to realize it, like yourself, otherwise you might be stuck for, you said like half

1:52:53.960 --> 1:52:57.400
 a semester, you could be stuck for quite a long time.

1:52:57.400 --> 1:53:04.040
 And I think also part of the programming is being okay in that state of confusion for

1:53:04.040 --> 1:53:09.960
 a while, it's to the debugging point, it's like, I just wrote two lines of code, why

1:53:09.960 --> 1:53:16.000
 doesn't this work, and staring at that for like hours, and trying to figure out, and

1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:19.080
 then every once in a while, you just have to restart your computer and everything works

1:53:19.080 --> 1:53:25.880
 again, and then you just kind of stare into the void with the tears slowly rolling down

1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:26.880
 your eye.

1:53:26.880 --> 1:53:30.760
 And the fact that they didn't get this actually had no impact on, I mean, they were still

1:53:30.760 --> 1:53:36.320
 able to do their assignments, because it turns out their misunderstanding wasn't being revealed

1:53:36.320 --> 1:53:40.200
 to them by the problem sets we were giving them.

1:53:40.200 --> 1:53:41.320
 It's a bit profound, actually, yeah.

1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:48.120
 I wrote a program a long time ago, actually, for my master's thesis, and in C++, I think,

1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:54.640
 or C, I guess it was C, and it was all memory management and terrible, and it wouldn't work

1:53:54.640 --> 1:53:59.840
 for a while, and it was some kind of, it was clear to me that it was overwriting memory,

1:53:59.840 --> 1:54:03.480
 and I just couldn't, I was like, look, I got a paper done, time for this.

1:54:03.480 --> 1:54:10.360
 So I basically declared a variable at the front in the main that was like 400k, just

1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:14.920
 an array, and it worked, because wherever I was scribbling over memory, it would scribble

1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:17.240
 into that space, and it didn't matter.

1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:21.440
 And so I never figured out what the bug was, but I did create something to sort of deal

1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:22.440
 with it.

1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:23.440
 To work around it.

1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:27.400
 You know, that's crazy, that's crazy, it was okay, because that's what I wanted.

1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:30.680
 But I knew enough about memory management to go, you know, management to go, you know,

1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:33.720
 I'm just going to create an empty array here and hope that that deals with the scribbling

1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:34.720
 memory problem.

1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:35.720
 And it did.

1:54:35.720 --> 1:54:37.160
 That takes a long time to figure out.

1:54:37.160 --> 1:54:39.880
 And by the way, the language you first learned probably does garbage collection anyway, so

1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:43.600
 you're not even going to come across, you're not going to come across that problem.

1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:49.680
 So we talked about the Minsky idea of hating everything you do and hating yourself.

1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:55.280
 So let's end on a question that's going to make both of you very uncomfortable, which

1:54:55.280 --> 1:55:04.440
 is what is your, Charles, what's your favorite thing that you're grateful for about Michael?

1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:09.040
 And Michael, what is your favorite thing that you're grateful for about Charles?

1:55:09.040 --> 1:55:14.560
 Well, that answer is actually quite easy, his friendship.

1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:15.560
 He stole the easy answer.

1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:16.560
 I did.

1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:17.560
 Yeah.

1:55:17.560 --> 1:55:18.560
 I can tell you what I hate about Charles.

1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:24.560
 The thing I like most about Charles, he sees the world in a similar enough, but different

1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:28.960
 way that I, it's sort of like having another life.

1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:32.800
 It's sort of like I get to experience things that I wouldn't otherwise get to experience

1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:36.200
 because I would not naturally gravitate to them that way.

1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:39.120
 And so he just, he just shows me a whole other world.

1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:40.120
 It's awesome.

1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:41.120
 Yeah.

1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:44.120
 The inner product is not zero for sure.

1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:47.680
 It's not quite one point seven, maybe.

1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:50.920
 Just enough that you can learn.

1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:53.200
 Just enough that you can learn.

1:55:53.200 --> 1:55:54.400
 That's the definition of friendship.

1:55:54.400 --> 1:55:55.800
 The inner product is point seven.

1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:56.800
 Yeah.

1:55:56.800 --> 1:55:57.800
 I think so.

1:55:57.800 --> 1:55:58.800
 That's the answer to life really.

1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:01.400
 Charles sometimes believes in me when I have not believed in me.

1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:07.480
 He also sometimes works as an outboard confidence that he has so much, so much confidence and

1:56:07.480 --> 1:56:16.200
 self, I don't know, comfortableness that I feel better a little bit.

1:56:16.200 --> 1:56:20.280
 If he thinks I'm okay, then maybe I'm not as bad as I think I am.

1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:24.720
 At the end of the day, luck favors the Charles.

1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:26.880
 It's a huge honor to talk with you.

1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:30.560
 Thank you so much for taking this time, wasting your time with me.

1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:32.200
 It was an awesome conversation.

1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:35.800
 You guys are an inspiration to a huge number of people and to me.

1:56:35.800 --> 1:56:36.800
 So really enjoy this.

1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:37.800
 Thanks for talking to me.

1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:38.800
 I enjoyed it as well.

1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:39.800
 Thank you so much.

1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:40.800
 Thanks guys.

1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:41.800
 And by the way, if luck favors the Charles, then it's certainly the case that I've been

1:56:41.800 --> 1:56:43.800
 very lucky to tell you.

1:56:43.800 --> 1:56:48.000
 I'm going to add that part out.
