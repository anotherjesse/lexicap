00:00.000 --> 00:03.920
 The following is a conversation with Gustav Sonastrom.

00:03.920 --> 00:07.280
 He's the chief research and development officer at Spotify,

00:07.280 --> 00:11.200
 leading their product design, data, technology, and engineering teams.

00:11.200 --> 00:15.280
 As I've said before, in my research and in life in general,

00:15.280 --> 00:18.720
 I love music, listening to it and creating it.

00:18.720 --> 00:23.600
 And using technology, especially personalization through machine learning

00:23.600 --> 00:27.920
 to enrich the music discovery and listening experience.

00:27.920 --> 00:31.920
 That is what Spotify has been doing for years, continually innovating,

00:31.920 --> 00:36.000
 defining how we experience music as a society in a digital age.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.280
 That's what Gustav and I talk about among many other topics,

00:39.280 --> 00:43.280
 including our shared appreciation of the movie True Romance,

00:43.280 --> 00:46.080
 in my view, one of the great movies of all time.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.280
 This is the Artificial Intelligence podcast.

00:49.280 --> 00:53.200

00:58.000 --> 01:00.400
 spelled F R I D M A N.

01:01.280 --> 01:05.120
 And now here's my conversation with Gustav Sonastrom.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.240
 Spotify has over 50 million songs in its catalog.

01:10.240 --> 01:13.200
 So let me ask the all important question.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.320
 I feel like you're the right person to ask.

01:16.320 --> 01:19.520
 What is the definitive greatest song of all time?

01:19.520 --> 01:22.880
 It varies for me, personally.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.960
 So you can't speak definitively for everyone?

01:26.240 --> 01:29.920
 I wouldn't believe very much in machine learning if I did,

01:29.920 --> 01:32.640
 right? Because everyone had the same taste.

01:32.640 --> 01:36.960
 So for you, what is you have to pick? What is the song?

01:36.960 --> 01:39.280
 All right. So it's it's pretty easy for me.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.160
 There is this song called You're So Cool,

01:42.160 --> 01:45.280
 Hans Zimmer, a soundtrack to True Romance.

01:45.280 --> 01:49.840
 It was a movie that made a big impression on me,

01:49.840 --> 01:52.720
 and it's kind of been following me through my life.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.440
 Actually, had to play at my wedding.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.040
 I sat with the organist and helped him play it on an organ,

01:59.040 --> 02:01.760
 which was a pretty pretty interesting experience.

02:01.760 --> 02:06.720
 That is probably my I would say top three movie of all time.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.320
 Yeah, this is an incredible movie.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.040
 Yeah. And it came out during my formative years.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.520
 And as I've discovered in music,

02:13.520 --> 02:16.560
 you shape your music taste during those years.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.560
 So it definitely affected me quite a bit.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.400
 Did it affect you in any other kind of way?

02:20.960 --> 02:23.440
 Well, the movie itself affected me back then.

02:23.440 --> 02:24.880
 It was a big part of culture.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.600
 I didn't really adopt any characters from the movie,

02:27.600 --> 02:30.400
 but it was it was a great story of love.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.160
 It's fantastic actors.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.480
 And and really, I didn't even know who Hans Zimmer was at the time,

02:36.480 --> 02:37.920
 but fantastic music.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.160
 And so that song has followed me.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.480
 And the movie actually has followed me throughout my life.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.320
 That was Quentin Tarantino, actually,

02:46.320 --> 02:48.480
 I think directed or produced that.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.000
 So it's not Stairway to Heaven or Bohemian Rhapsody.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.600
 It's those are those are great.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.800
 They're not my personal favorites,

02:54.800 --> 02:57.760
 but I've realized that people have different tastes.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.400
 And that's that's a big part of what we do.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.560
 Well, for me, I don't have to stick with Stairway to Heaven.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.360
 So 35,000 years ago, I looked this up on Wikipedia,

03:09.360 --> 03:11.760
 flute like instruments started being used in caves

03:11.760 --> 03:15.600
 as part of hunting rituals and primitive cultural gatherings,

03:15.600 --> 03:16.240
 things like that.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.760
 This is the birth of music.

03:18.560 --> 03:22.080
 Since then, we had a few folks, Beethoven, Elvis, Beatles,

03:22.640 --> 03:25.520
 Justin Bieber, of course, Drake.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.840
 So in your view, let's start like high level philosophical.

03:29.840 --> 03:34.640
 What is the purpose of music on this planet of ours?

03:35.760 --> 03:38.800
 I think music has many different purposes.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.880
 I think there's there's certainly a big purpose,

03:42.880 --> 03:45.200
 which is the same as much of entertainment,

03:45.200 --> 03:50.880
 which is escapism and to be able to live in some sort of

03:50.880 --> 03:52.080
 other mental state for a while.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.800
 But I also think you have the the opposite of escaping,

03:54.800 --> 03:57.200
 which is to help you focus on something you are actually doing.

03:57.760 --> 04:02.560
 As I think people use music as a tool to to tune the brain

04:03.120 --> 04:05.680
 to the activities that they are actually doing.

04:05.680 --> 04:10.720
 And it's kind of like in one sense,

04:10.720 --> 04:12.080
 maybe it's the rawest signal.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.720
 If you if you think about the brain as neural networks,

04:14.720 --> 04:16.720
 it's maybe the most efficient hack we can do

04:16.720 --> 04:19.840
 to actually actively tune it into some state that you want to be.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.360
 You can do it in other ways.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.840
 You can tell stories to put people in a certain mood,

04:23.840 --> 04:25.760
 but music is probably very effective

04:25.760 --> 04:27.520
 to get to a certain mood very fast.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.000
 You know, there's a there's a social component historically

04:32.000 --> 04:34.080
 to music where people listen to music together.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.160
 I was just thinking about this,

04:36.160 --> 04:39.440
 that to me, and you mentioned machine learning,

04:39.440 --> 04:44.400
 but to me personally, music is a really private thing.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.280
 Like I'm speaking for myself.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.160
 I listen to music like almost nobody knows

04:50.160 --> 04:52.080
 the kind of things I have in my library,

04:52.720 --> 04:54.480
 except people who are really close to me

04:54.480 --> 04:56.880
 and they really only know a certain percentage.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.400
 There's like some weird stuff

04:58.400 --> 05:01.120
 that I'm almost probably embarrassed by, right?

05:01.120 --> 05:02.480
 It's called the guilty pleasures, right?

05:02.480 --> 05:04.560
 Everyone has the guilty pleasures, yeah.

05:04.560 --> 05:05.760
 Hopefully they're not too bad.

05:07.760 --> 05:08.640
 For me, it's personal.

05:08.640 --> 05:12.000
 Do you think of music as something that's social

05:12.640 --> 05:14.880
 or as something that's personal?

05:14.880 --> 05:15.680
 Or does it vary?

05:16.720 --> 05:22.720
 So I think it's the same answer that you use it for both.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.080
 We've thought a lot about this

05:24.880 --> 05:26.960
 during these 10 years at Spotify, obviously.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.120
 In one sense, as you said, music is incredibly social.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.720
 You go to concerts and so forth.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.280
 On the other hand, it is your escape

05:37.280 --> 05:41.360
 and everyone has these things that are very personal to them.

05:42.080 --> 05:47.040
 So what we've found is that when it comes to,

05:47.040 --> 05:50.640
 to most people claim that they have a friend or two

05:50.640 --> 05:53.840
 that they are heavily inspired by and that they listen to.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.680
 So I actually think music is very social,

05:55.680 --> 05:57.440
 but in a smaller group setting,

05:57.440 --> 06:03.360
 it's an intimate form of, it's an intimate relationship.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.400
 It's not something that you necessarily share broadly.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.000
 Now at concerts, you can argue you do,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.080
 but then you've gathered a lot of people

06:10.080 --> 06:11.840
 that you have something in common with.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.880
 I think this broadcast sharing of music

06:16.160 --> 06:19.920
 is something we tried on social networks and so forth,

06:19.920 --> 06:24.400
 but it turns out that people aren't super interested in

06:24.400 --> 06:26.960
 what their friends listen to.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.400
 They're interested in understanding

06:30.400 --> 06:32.880
 if they have something in common perhaps with a friend,

06:32.880 --> 06:35.040
 but not just as information.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.360
 Right, that's really interesting.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.880
 I was just thinking that this morning listening to Spotify,

06:41.600 --> 06:45.360
 I really have a pretty intimate relationship with Spotify,

06:45.360 --> 06:47.120
 with my playlists.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.760
 I've had them for many years now

06:51.760 --> 06:53.360
 and they've grown with me together.

06:53.360 --> 06:56.640
 There's an intimate relationship you have

06:56.640 --> 06:59.520
 with a library of music that you've developed.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.920
 And we'll talk about different ways we can play with that.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.640
 Can you do the impossible task

07:04.640 --> 07:08.240
 and try to give a history of music listening

07:09.280 --> 07:12.720
 from your perspective, from before the internet

07:12.720 --> 07:14.160
 and after the internet?

07:14.160 --> 07:17.760
 And just kind of everything leading up to streaming

07:17.760 --> 07:18.800
 with Spotify and so on.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.800
 I'll try, it could be a 100 year podcast.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.400
 Yeah.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.480
 I'll try to do a brief version.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.120
 There are some things that I think are very interesting

07:27.120 --> 07:28.080
 during the history of music,

07:28.080 --> 07:31.200
 which is that before recorded music,

07:31.920 --> 07:33.040
 to be able to enjoy music,

07:33.040 --> 07:35.440
 you actually had to be where the music was produced

07:35.440 --> 07:38.640
 because you couldn't record it and time shift it, right?

07:38.640 --> 07:40.480
 Creation and consumption had to happen at the same time,

07:40.480 --> 07:41.520
 basically concerts.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.440
 And so you either had to get to the nearest village

07:46.080 --> 07:47.280
 to listen to music.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.960
 And while that was cumbersome

07:48.960 --> 07:51.760
 and it severely limited the distribution of music,

07:52.320 --> 07:54.000
 it also had some different qualities,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.800
 which was that the creator could always interact

07:56.800 --> 07:57.440
 with the audience.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.480
 It was always live.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.520
 And also there was no time cap on the music.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.040
 So I think it's not a coincidence

08:03.040 --> 08:05.760
 that these early classical works,

08:05.760 --> 08:07.520
 they're much longer than the three minutes.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.960
 The three minutes came in as a restriction

08:10.960 --> 08:13.520
 of the first wax disc that could only contain

08:13.520 --> 08:16.000
 a three minute song on one side, right?

08:16.000 --> 08:20.640
 So actually the recorded music severely limited the,

08:21.440 --> 08:22.240
 or put constraints.

08:22.240 --> 08:22.960
 I won't say limit.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.080
 I mean, constraints are often good,

08:24.080 --> 08:26.880
 but it put very hard constraints on the music format.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.760
 So you kind of said, like instead of doing this opus

08:29.760 --> 08:32.320
 of like many, you know, tens of minutes or something,

08:33.120 --> 08:34.240
 now you get three and a half minutes

08:34.240 --> 08:36.240
 because then you're out of wax on this disc.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.000
 But in return, you get an amazing distribution.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.920
 Your reach will widen, right?

08:41.920 --> 08:43.120
 Just on that point real quick,

08:43.120 --> 08:47.360
 without the mass scale distribution,

08:47.920 --> 08:52.880
 there's a scarcity component where you kind of look forward to it.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.800
 We had that, it's like the Netflix versus HBO Game of Thrones.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.720
 You like wait for the event because you can't really listen to it.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.640
 So you like look forward to it and then it's,

09:05.600 --> 09:07.360
 you derive perhaps more pleasure

09:07.360 --> 09:10.560
 because it's more rare for you to listen to particular piece.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.040
 You think there's value to that scarcity?

09:13.040 --> 09:15.280
 Yeah, I think that that is definitely a thing.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.680
 And there's always this component of

09:17.680 --> 09:19.680
 if you have something in infinite amount,

09:19.680 --> 09:21.600
 so will you value it as much?

09:22.560 --> 09:23.120
 Probably not.

09:23.680 --> 09:27.040
 Humanity is always seeking some, is relative.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.480
 So you're always seeking something you didn't have

09:28.480 --> 09:30.160
 and when you have it, you don't appreciate it as much.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.240
 So I think that's probably true.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.000
 But I think that's why concerts exist.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.520
 So you can actually have both.

09:36.480 --> 09:39.200
 But I think net, if you couldn't listen to music

09:39.200 --> 09:42.320
 in your car driving, that'd be worse.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.600
 That cost will be bigger than the benefit of the anticipation,

09:45.600 --> 09:46.560
 I think, that you would have.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.640
 So, yeah, it started with live concerts.

09:50.640 --> 09:57.040
 Then it's being able to, you know, the photograph invented, right?

09:57.040 --> 09:59.520
 You start to be able to record music.

09:59.520 --> 10:00.160
 Exactly.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.160
 So then you got this massive distribution

10:02.160 --> 10:04.800
 that made it possible to create two things.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.640
 I think, first of all, cultural phenomenons.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.160
 They probably need distribution.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.800
 Distribution to be able to happen.

10:11.600 --> 10:16.480
 But it also opened access to, you know, for a new kind of artist.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.160
 So you started to have these phenomenons,

10:18.160 --> 10:19.680
 like Beatles and Elvis and so forth,

10:19.680 --> 10:22.720
 that would really a function of distribution, I think.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.640
 Obviously, of talent and innovation,

10:24.640 --> 10:26.080
 but there was also taking a component.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.800
 And of course, the next big innovation to come along

10:28.800 --> 10:30.640
 was radio, broadcast radio.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.480
 And I think radio is interesting

10:34.480 --> 10:37.040
 because it started not as a music medium.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.400
 It started as an information medium for news.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.640
 And then radio needed to find something to fill the time with

10:44.640 --> 10:47.920
 so that they could honestly play more ads and make more money.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.440
 And music was free.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.000
 So then you had this massive distribution

10:52.000 --> 10:53.280
 where you could program to people.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.960
 I think those things, that ecosystem,

10:56.000 --> 11:00.160
 is what created the ability for hits.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.640
 But it was also a very broadcast medium.

11:02.640 --> 11:05.040
 So you would tend to get these massive, massive hits,

11:05.040 --> 11:06.800
 but maybe not such a long tail.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.520
 In terms of choice of everybody listening to the same stuff.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.880
 Yeah. And as you said, I think there are some social benefits to that.

11:15.760 --> 11:19.040
 I think, for example, there is a high statistical chance

11:19.040 --> 11:21.440
 that if I talk about the latest episode of Game of Thrones,

11:21.440 --> 11:23.600
 we have something to talk about just statistically.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.200
 In the age of individual choice, maybe some of that goes away.

11:27.200 --> 11:33.680
 So I do see the value of shared cultural components.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.080
 But I also obviously love personalization.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.080
 And so let's catch this up to the internet.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.160
 So maybe Napster.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.000
 Well, first of all, there's like MP3s.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.680
 Exactly. There's tape, CDs.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.320
 There was a digitalization of music with a CD, really.

11:48.320 --> 11:51.280
 It was physical distribution, but the music became digital.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.440
 And so they were files, but basically boxed software,

11:55.440 --> 11:56.880
 to use a software analogy.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.840
 And then you could start downloading these files.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.440
 And I think there are two interesting things that happened

12:03.440 --> 12:05.600
 back to music used to be longer

12:05.600 --> 12:08.160
 before it was constrained by the distribution medium.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.720
 I don't think that was a coincidence.

12:10.720 --> 12:14.560
 And then really the only music genre to have developed mostly after

12:15.360 --> 12:18.000
 music was a file again on the internet is EDM.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.440
 And EDM is often much longer than the traditional music.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.480
 I think it's interesting to think about the fact that

12:24.480 --> 12:28.080
 music is no longer constrained in minutes per song or something.

12:28.080 --> 12:32.080
 It's a legacy of an old distribution technology.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.640
 And you see some of this new music that breaks the format,

12:34.640 --> 12:36.880
 not so much as I would have expected actually by now,

12:37.680 --> 12:39.200
 but it still happens.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.080
 So first of all, I don't really know what EDM is.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.560
 Electronic dance music, you could say.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.280
 Avicii was one of the biggest in this genre.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.640
 So the main constraint is of time,

12:50.640 --> 12:53.280
 something like three, four, five minutes song.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.440
 So you could have songs that were eight minutes,

12:55.440 --> 12:56.640
 10 minutes, and so forth.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.320
 Because it started as a digital product

13:00.320 --> 13:03.920
 that you downloaded, so you didn't have this constraint anymore.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.720
 So I think it's something really interesting

13:06.720 --> 13:08.480
 that I don't think has fully happened yet.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.440
 We're kind of jumping ahead a little bit to where we are,

13:11.440 --> 13:14.960
 but I think there's tons of formal innovation in music

13:15.760 --> 13:19.040
 that should happen now, that couldn't happen

13:19.040 --> 13:22.000
 when you needed to really adhere to the distribution constraints.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.280
 If you didn't adhere to that, you would get no distribution.

13:25.280 --> 13:28.640
 So Björk, for example, an Icelandic artist,

13:28.640 --> 13:30.880
 she made a full iPad app as an album.

13:30.880 --> 13:34.960
 That was very expensive, even though the App Store

13:34.960 --> 13:38.080
 has great distribution, she gets nowhere near the distribution

13:38.080 --> 13:40.240
 versus staying within the three minute format.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.840
 So I think now that music is fully digital

13:43.840 --> 13:45.840
 inside these streaming services,

13:45.840 --> 13:48.320
 there is the opportunity to change the format again

13:48.320 --> 13:51.360
 and allow creators to be much more creative

13:51.360 --> 13:54.400
 without limiting their distribution ability.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.320
 That's interesting that you're right.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.680
 You're right, it's surprising that we don't see

13:59.680 --> 14:01.680
 that taking advantage more often.

14:01.680 --> 14:05.040
 It's almost like the constraints of the distribution

14:05.040 --> 14:08.720
 from the 50s and 60s have molded the culture

14:08.720 --> 14:12.000
 to where we want the three to five minute song,

14:12.800 --> 14:14.800
 that anything else, not just...

14:14.800 --> 14:17.840
 So we want the song as consumers and as artists,

14:18.640 --> 14:20.400
 like, because I write a lot of music

14:20.400 --> 14:22.720
 and I never even thought about writing something

14:22.720 --> 14:25.680
 longer than 10 minutes.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.720
 It's really interesting that those constraints...

14:28.720 --> 14:30.160
 Because all your training data

14:30.160 --> 14:31.920
 has been three and a half minutes long, right?

14:31.920 --> 14:32.400
 It's right.

14:32.960 --> 14:38.400
 Okay, so yeah, digitization of data led to then MP3s.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.400
 Yeah, so I think you had this file then

14:41.440 --> 14:43.120
 that was distributed physically,

14:43.680 --> 14:46.400
 but then you had the components of digital distribution

14:46.400 --> 14:49.680
 and then the internet happened and there was this vacuum

14:49.680 --> 14:52.560
 where you had a format that could be digitally shipped

14:52.560 --> 14:53.760
 but there was no business model.

14:54.320 --> 14:58.000
 And then all these pirate networks happened.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.600
 Napster and in Sweden, Pirate Bay,

15:01.600 --> 15:02.960
 which was one of the biggest.

15:02.960 --> 15:07.120
 And I think from a consumer point of view,

15:07.120 --> 15:10.560
 which leads up to the inception of Spotify

15:10.560 --> 15:11.680
 from a consumer point of view,

15:13.200 --> 15:16.240
 consumers for the first time had this access model to music

15:17.040 --> 15:21.200
 where they could, without any marginal cost,

15:21.200 --> 15:24.400
 they could try different tracks.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.720
 You could use music in new ways.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.840
 There was no marginal cost.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.080
 And that was a fantastic consumer experience.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.840
 They have access to all the music ever made.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.280
 I think it was fantastic.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.600
 But it was also horrible for artists

15:35.600 --> 15:37.280
 because there was no business model around it.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.640
 So they didn't make any money.

15:38.640 --> 15:43.840
 So the user need almost drove the user interface

15:43.840 --> 15:45.280
 before there was a business model.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.440
 And then there were these download stores

15:48.640 --> 15:50.400
 that allowed you to download files.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.920
 Which was a solution,

15:51.920 --> 15:53.920
 but it didn't solve the access problem.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.760
 There was still a marginal cost of 99 cents

15:55.760 --> 15:57.040
 to try one more track.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.400
 And I think that heavily limits how you listen to music.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.480
 The example I always give is in Spotify,

16:04.480 --> 16:07.440
 a huge amount of people listen to music while they sleep,

16:07.440 --> 16:09.120
 while they go to sleep and while they sleep.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.160
 If that costed you 99 cents per three minutes,

16:12.160 --> 16:13.760
 you probably wouldn't do that.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.760
 And you would be much less adventurous

16:15.760 --> 16:17.920
 if there was a real dollar cost to explore music.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.880
 So the access model is interesting in that

16:20.880 --> 16:22.320
 it changes your music behavior.

16:22.880 --> 16:25.600
 You can take much more risk

16:25.600 --> 16:27.120
 because there's no marginal cost to it.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.480
 Maybe let me linger on piracy for a second.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.880
 Because I find, especially coming from Russia,

16:33.840 --> 16:36.080
 piracy is something that's very interesting.

16:36.640 --> 16:41.520
 To me, not me of course ever,

16:41.520 --> 16:47.040
 but I have friends who've partook in piracy

16:47.040 --> 16:52.960
 of music, software, TV shows, sporting events.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.760
 And usually, to me, what that shows

16:55.760 --> 16:59.040
 is not that they can actually pay the money

16:59.600 --> 17:01.040
 and they're not trying to save money.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.000
 They're choosing the best experience.

17:05.120 --> 17:07.520
 So what to me, piracy shows

17:07.520 --> 17:09.920
 is a business opportunity in all these domains.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.480
 And that's where I think you're right.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.880
 Spotify stepped in is basically,

17:14.880 --> 17:17.120
 piracy is an experience.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.600
 You can explore, find music you like.

17:20.240 --> 17:24.320
 And actually, the interface of piracy is horrible.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.800
 Because it's, I mean...

17:26.800 --> 17:30.960
 Bad metadata, long download times, all kinds of stuff.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.040
 And what Spotify does is basically

17:34.880 --> 17:36.160
 first, rewards artists,

17:36.160 --> 17:38.560
 and second, makes the experience

17:38.560 --> 17:40.080
 of exploring music much better.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.920
 I mean, the same is true, I think, for movies and so on.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.960
 Piracy reveals, in the software space, for example,

17:46.960 --> 17:49.760
 I'm a huge user and fan of Adobe products.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.600
 And there was much more incentive

17:53.600 --> 17:55.360
 to pirate Adobe products

17:55.360 --> 17:57.680
 before they went to a monthly subscription plan.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.040
 And now, all of the said friends

18:01.600 --> 18:05.040
 that used to pirate Adobe products that I know,

18:05.040 --> 18:08.000
 now actually pay, gladly, for the monthly subscription.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.280
 Yeah, I think you're right.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.520
 I think it's a sign of an opportunity

18:11.520 --> 18:12.960
 for product development.

18:12.960 --> 18:17.760
 And that sometimes there's a product market fit

18:17.760 --> 18:21.360
 before there's a business model fit in product development.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.200
 I think that's a sign of it.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.760
 In Sweden, I think it was a bit of both.

18:25.760 --> 18:29.680
 There was a culture where we even had

18:29.680 --> 18:32.000
 a political party called the Pirate Party.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.120
 And this was during the time when people said that

18:35.120 --> 18:36.640
 information should be free.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.360
 It was somehow wrong to charge for ones and zeros.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.480
 So I think people felt that artists

18:42.480 --> 18:44.720
 should probably make some money somehow else

18:44.720 --> 18:46.240
 in concerts or something.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.280
 So at least in Sweden, it was part really social acceptance

18:49.280 --> 18:51.120
 even at the political level.

18:51.120 --> 18:55.120
 But that also forced Spotify to compete with free,

18:57.120 --> 18:58.800
 which I don't think could have happened

18:58.800 --> 19:00.080
 anywhere else in the world.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.960
 The music industry needed to be doing bad enough

19:02.960 --> 19:04.400
 to take that risk.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.240
 And Sweden was like the perfect testing ground.

19:06.240 --> 19:10.960
 It had government funded high bandwidth, low latency broadband,

19:10.960 --> 19:12.880
 which meant that the product would work.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.520
 And it was also, there was no music revenue anyway.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.800
 So they were kind of like,

19:16.800 --> 19:19.040
 I don't think this is going to work, but why not?

19:20.320 --> 19:22.640
 So this product is one that I don't think could have happened

19:22.640 --> 19:24.800
 in America, the world's largest music market, for example.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.040
 So how do you compete with free?

19:27.040 --> 19:29.840
 Because that's an interesting world of the internet

19:29.840 --> 19:32.960
 where most people don't like to pay for things.

19:32.960 --> 19:37.120
 So Spotify steps in and tries to, yes, compete with free.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.320
 How do you do it?

19:38.320 --> 19:39.760
 So I think two things.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.360
 One is people are starting to pay for things on the internet.

19:43.360 --> 19:46.560
 I think one way to think about it was that advertising

19:46.560 --> 19:48.560
 was the first business model

19:48.560 --> 19:50.560
 because no one would put the credit card on the internet.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.720
 Transactional with Amazon was the second.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.320
 And maybe subscription is the third.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.520
 And if you look offline, subscription is the biggest of those.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.120
 So that may still happen.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.320
 I think people are starting to pay.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.120
 But definitely back then, we needed to compete with free.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.960
 And the first thing you need to do is obviously

20:04.960 --> 20:06.960
 to lower the price to free.

20:06.960 --> 20:10.160
 And then you need to be better somehow.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.760
 And the way that Spotify was better was on the user experience,

20:13.760 --> 20:19.760
 on the actual performance, the latency of, you know,

20:19.760 --> 20:24.560
 even if you had high band with broadband,

20:24.560 --> 20:27.360
 it would still take you 30 seconds to a minute

20:27.360 --> 20:28.960
 to download one of these tracks.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.360
 So the Spotify experience of starting within the

20:31.360 --> 20:34.560
 perceptual limit of immediacy, about 250 milliseconds,

20:34.560 --> 20:37.360
 meant that the whole trick was,

20:37.360 --> 20:39.760
 it felt as if you had downloaded all of Pirate Bay.

20:39.760 --> 20:40.960
 It was on your hard drive.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.360
 It was that fast, even though it wasn't.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.960
 And it was still free.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.960
 But somehow you were actually still being a legal citizen.

20:48.960 --> 20:52.960
 That was the trick that Spotify managed to pull off.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.560
 So I've actually heard you say this or write this.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.960
 And I was surprised that I wasn't aware of it,

20:58.960 --> 21:00.560
 because I just took it for granted.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.560
 You know, whenever an awesome thing comes along,

21:02.560 --> 21:04.560
 you just like, oh, of course it has to be this way.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.560
 That's exactly right.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.560
 That it felt like the entire world's libraries

21:08.560 --> 21:12.560
 at my fingertips because of that latency being reduced.

21:12.560 --> 21:16.560
 What was the technical challenge in reducing the late?

21:16.560 --> 21:20.560
 So there was a group of really, really talented engineers.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.560
 One of them called Ludwig Strigius.

21:22.560 --> 21:26.560
 He wrote the, actually from Gothenburg,

21:26.560 --> 21:30.560
 he wrote the initial, the UTorrent Clients,

21:30.560 --> 21:32.560
 which is kind of an interesting backstory to Spotify,

21:32.560 --> 21:36.560
 you know, that we have one of the top developers

21:36.560 --> 21:38.560
 from BitTorrent Clients as well.

21:38.560 --> 21:42.560
 So he wrote UTorrent, the world's smallest BitTorrent Clients.

21:42.560 --> 21:47.560
 And then he was acquired very early by Daniel and Martin,

21:47.560 --> 21:50.560
 who founded Spotify, and they actually sold the UTorrent Client

21:50.560 --> 21:52.560
 to BitTorrent, but kept Ludwig.

21:52.560 --> 21:58.560
 So Spotify had a lot of experience within peer to peer networking.

21:58.560 --> 22:02.560
 So the original innovation was a distribution innovation,

22:02.560 --> 22:05.560
 where Spotify built an end to end media distribution system.

22:05.560 --> 22:08.560
 Up until only a few years ago, we actually hosted all the music ourselves.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.560
 So we had both the server side and the client,

22:10.560 --> 22:14.560
 and that meant that we could do things such as having a peer to peer solution

22:14.560 --> 22:17.560
 to use local caching on the client side,

22:17.560 --> 22:20.560
 because back then the world was mostly desktop.

22:20.560 --> 22:24.560
 But we could also do things like hack the TCP protocols,

22:24.560 --> 22:28.560
 things like Nagle's algorithm for kind of exponential back off,

22:28.560 --> 22:32.560
 or ramp up and just go full throttle and optimize for latency

22:32.560 --> 22:34.560
 at the cost of bandwidth.

22:34.560 --> 22:38.560
 And all of this end to end control meant that we could do

22:38.560 --> 22:41.560
 an experience that felt like a step change.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.560
 These days, we actually are on on GCP.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.560
 We don't host our own stuff, and everyone is really fast these days.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.560
 So that was the initial competitive advantage,

22:50.560 --> 22:52.560
 but then obviously you have to move on over time.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.560
 And that was over 10 years ago, right?

22:55.560 --> 22:58.560
 That was in 2008, the product was launched in Sweden.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.560
 It was in a beta, I think, 2007.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.560
 And it was on the desktop, right?

23:02.560 --> 23:03.560
 It was desktop only.

23:03.560 --> 23:04.560
 There's no phone.

23:04.560 --> 23:05.560
 There was no phone.

23:05.560 --> 23:08.560
 The iPhone came out in 2008,

23:08.560 --> 23:11.560
 but the App Store came out one year later, I think.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.560
 So the writing was on the wall, but there was no phone yet.

23:14.560 --> 23:19.560
 You've mentioned that people would use Spotify

23:19.560 --> 23:20.560
 to discover the songs they like,

23:20.560 --> 23:23.560
 and then they would torrent those songs

23:23.560 --> 23:26.560
 so they can copy it to their phone.

23:26.560 --> 23:27.560
 Just hilarious.

23:27.560 --> 23:28.560
 Exactly.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.560
 Or not torrent.

23:29.560 --> 23:34.560
 Seriously, piracy does seem to be a good guide

23:34.560 --> 23:36.560
 for business models.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.560
 Video content.

23:37.560 --> 23:40.560
 As far as I know, Spotify doesn't have video content.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.560
 Well, we do have music videos,

23:42.560 --> 23:44.560
 and we do have videos on the service,

23:44.560 --> 23:46.560
 but the way we think about ourselves is that

23:46.560 --> 23:48.560
 we're an audio service,

23:48.560 --> 23:52.560
 and we think that if you look at the amount of time

23:52.560 --> 23:53.560
 that people spend on audio,

23:53.560 --> 23:56.560
 it's actually very similar to the amount of time

23:56.560 --> 23:57.560
 that people spend on video.

23:57.560 --> 24:01.560
 So the opportunity should be equally big,

24:01.560 --> 24:02.560
 but today it's not at all valued.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.560
 Video is valued much higher.

24:04.560 --> 24:07.560
 So we think it's basically completely undervalued.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.560
 We think of ourselves as an audio service,

24:09.560 --> 24:12.560
 but within that audio service, I think video

24:12.560 --> 24:13.560
 can make a lot of sense.

24:13.560 --> 24:16.560
 I think when you're discovering an artist,

24:16.560 --> 24:17.560
 you probably do want to see them

24:17.560 --> 24:18.560
 and understand who they are,

24:18.560 --> 24:20.560
 to understand their identity.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.560
 Do you want to see that video every time?

24:21.560 --> 24:22.560
 No.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.560
 90% of the time the phone is going to be in your pocket.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.560
 For podcasters, you use video.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.560
 I think that can make a ton of sense.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.560
 So we do have video,

24:29.560 --> 24:31.560
 but we're an audio service where,

24:31.560 --> 24:33.560
 think of it as we call it internally,

24:33.560 --> 24:34.560
 backgroundable video.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.560
 Video that is helpful,

24:35.560 --> 24:38.560
 but isn't the driver of the narrative.

24:38.560 --> 24:42.560
 I think also if you look at YouTube,

24:42.560 --> 24:43.560
 the way people,

24:43.560 --> 24:47.560
 there's quite a few folks who listen to music on YouTube.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.560
 So in some sense,

24:48.560 --> 24:52.560
 YouTube is a bit of a competitor to Spotify,

24:52.560 --> 24:55.560
 which is very strange to me that people use YouTube

24:55.560 --> 24:56.560
 to listen to music.

24:56.560 --> 24:59.560
 They play essentially the music videos, right?

24:59.560 --> 25:02.560
 But don't watch the videos and put it in their pocket.

25:02.560 --> 25:07.560
 Well, I think it's similar to what

25:07.560 --> 25:11.560
 strangely maybe it's similar to what we were

25:11.560 --> 25:13.560
 for the Piracy Networks,

25:13.560 --> 25:17.560
 where YouTube for historical reasons

25:17.560 --> 25:20.560
 have a lot of music videos.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.560
 So you use,

25:21.560 --> 25:23.560
 people use YouTube for a lot of the discovery part

25:23.560 --> 25:24.560
 of the process, I think.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.560
 But then it's not a really good

25:26.560 --> 25:28.560
 sort of quote unquote MP3 player,

25:28.560 --> 25:29.560
 because it doesn't even background.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.560
 Then you have to keep the app in the foreground.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.560
 So the consumption,

25:32.560 --> 25:34.560
 it's not a good consumption tool,

25:34.560 --> 25:35.560
 but it's a decently good discovery.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.560
 I mean, I think YouTube is fantastic products.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.560
 And I use it for all kinds of purposes.

25:39.560 --> 25:40.560
 That's true.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.560
 If I were to admit something,

25:42.560 --> 25:44.560
 I do use YouTube a little bit for the discovery,

25:44.560 --> 25:46.560
 to assist in the discovery process of songs.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.560
 And then if I like it,

25:48.560 --> 25:50.560
 I'll add it to Spotify.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.560
 But that's okay.

25:51.560 --> 25:52.560
 That's okay with us.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.560
 Okay.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.560
 So sorry, we're jumping around a little bit.

25:55.560 --> 25:58.560
 So this kind of incredible,

25:58.560 --> 25:59.560
 you look at Napster,

25:59.560 --> 26:01.560
 you look at the early days of Spotify.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.560
 How do you,

26:02.560 --> 26:04.560
 one fascinating point is how do you grow

26:04.560 --> 26:05.560
 a user base?

26:05.560 --> 26:07.560
 So you're there in Sweden.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.560
 You have an idea.

26:09.560 --> 26:12.560
 I saw the initial sketches that looked terrible.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.560
 How do you grow a user base

26:14.560 --> 26:18.560
 from a few folks to millions?

26:18.560 --> 26:21.560
 I think there are a bunch of tactical answers.

26:21.560 --> 26:22.560
 So first of all,

26:22.560 --> 26:23.560
 I think you need a great product.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.560
 I don't think you take a bad product

26:25.560 --> 26:29.560
 and market it to be successful.

26:29.560 --> 26:30.560
 So you need a great product.

26:30.560 --> 26:31.560
 Sorry to interrupt,

26:31.560 --> 26:33.560
 but it's a totally new way to listen to music.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.560
 So it's not just,

26:34.560 --> 26:38.560
 did people realize immediately that Spotify is a great product?

26:38.560 --> 26:39.560
 I think they did.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.560
 So back to the point of piracy,

26:41.560 --> 26:44.560
 it was a totally new way to listen to music legally,

26:44.560 --> 26:47.560
 but people had been used to the access model in Sweden

26:47.560 --> 26:49.560
 and the rest of the world for a long time through piracy.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.560
 So one way to think about Spotify,

26:51.560 --> 26:53.560
 it was just legal and fast piracy.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.560
 And so people have been using it for a long time.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.560
 So they weren't alien to it.

26:57.560 --> 27:00.560
 They didn't really understand how it could be legal

27:00.560 --> 27:03.560
 because it seemed too fast and too good to be true,

27:03.560 --> 27:05.560
 which I think is a great product proposition

27:05.560 --> 27:07.560
 if you can be too good to be true.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.560
 But what I saw again and again

27:09.560 --> 27:10.560
 was people showing each other,

27:10.560 --> 27:12.560
 clicking the song, showing how fast it started

27:12.560 --> 27:14.560
 and say, can you believe this?

27:14.560 --> 27:17.560
 So I really think it was about speed.

27:17.560 --> 27:20.560
 Then we also had an invite program

27:20.560 --> 27:22.560
 that was really meant for scaling

27:22.560 --> 27:24.560
 because we hosted our own servers.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.560
 We needed to control scaling,

27:26.560 --> 27:28.560
 but that built a lot of expectation

27:28.560 --> 27:30.560
 and I don't want to say hype

27:30.560 --> 27:34.560
 because hype implies that it wasn't true.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.560
 Expectations, excitement around the product.

27:37.560 --> 27:40.560
 And we replicated that when we launched in the US.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.560
 We also built up an invite only program first.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.560
 There are lots of tactics,

27:44.560 --> 27:46.560
 but I think you need a great product

27:46.560 --> 27:48.560
 to solve some problem.

27:48.560 --> 27:51.560
 And basically the key innovation,

27:51.560 --> 27:54.560
 there was technology, but on a meta level,

27:54.560 --> 27:56.560
 the innovation was really the access model

27:56.560 --> 27:58.560
 versus the ownership model.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.560
 And that was tricky.

28:00.560 --> 28:04.560
 A lot of people said that they wanted to own their music.

28:04.560 --> 28:07.560
 They would never kind of rent it or borrow it.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.560
 But I think the fact that we had a free tier

28:09.560 --> 28:12.560
 which meant that you get to keep this music for life as well

28:12.560 --> 28:14.560
 helped quite a lot.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.560
 So this is an interesting psychological point

28:17.560 --> 28:19.560
 that maybe you can speak to.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.560
 It was a big shift for me.

28:21.560 --> 28:25.560
 It's almost like to go to therapy for this.

28:25.560 --> 28:29.560
 I think I would describe my early listening experience

28:29.560 --> 28:31.560
 and I think a lot of my friends do,

28:31.560 --> 28:33.560
 is basically hoarding music.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.560
 As you're slowly one song by one song,

28:36.560 --> 28:37.560
 or maybe albums,

28:37.560 --> 28:40.560
 gathering a collection of music that you love.

28:40.560 --> 28:42.560
 And you own it.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.560
 Especially with CDs or tape,

28:44.560 --> 28:46.560
 you physically had it.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.560
 And what Spotify,

28:48.560 --> 28:50.560
 what I had to come to grips with,

28:50.560 --> 28:52.560
 and it was kind of liberating actually,

28:52.560 --> 28:55.560
 is to throw away all the music.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.560
 I've had this therapy session with lots of people.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.560
 And I think the mental trick is,

29:00.560 --> 29:02.560
 so actually we've seen the user data.

29:02.560 --> 29:03.560
 When Spotify started,

29:03.560 --> 29:05.560
 a lot of people did the exact same thing.

29:05.560 --> 29:06.560
 They started hoarding,

29:06.560 --> 29:09.560
 as if the music would disappear.

29:09.560 --> 29:11.560
 Almost the equivalent of downloading.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.560
 And so we had these playlists that had limits

29:14.560 --> 29:16.560
 of a few hundred thousand tracks

29:16.560 --> 29:18.560
 and we figured no one would ever.

29:18.560 --> 29:19.560
 Well, they do.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.560
 It's in hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tracks.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.560
 And to this day,

29:23.560 --> 29:25.560
 some people want to actually save,

29:25.560 --> 29:26.560
 quote unquote,

29:26.560 --> 29:27.560
 and play the entire catalog.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.560
 But I think that the therapy session

29:29.560 --> 29:31.560
 goes something like,

29:31.560 --> 29:34.560
 instead of throwing away your music,

29:34.560 --> 29:36.560
 if you took your files

29:36.560 --> 29:39.560
 and you stored them in a locker at Google,

29:39.560 --> 29:40.560
 it'd be a streaming service.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.560
 It's just that in that locker,

29:41.560 --> 29:43.560
 you have all the world's music now for free.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.560
 So instead of giving away your music,

29:44.560 --> 29:46.560
 you got all the music.

29:46.560 --> 29:47.560
 It's yours.

29:47.560 --> 29:48.560
 You could think of it as having a copy

29:48.560 --> 29:50.560
 of the world's catalog there forever.

29:50.560 --> 29:53.560
 So you actually got more music instead of less.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.560
 It's just that you just took that hard disk

29:56.560 --> 29:59.560
 and you sent it to someone who stored it for you.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.560
 And once you go through that mental journey of,

30:01.560 --> 30:03.560
 like, still my files, they're just over there.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.560
 And I just have 40 million or 50 million or something now.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.560
 Then people are like, okay, that's good.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.560
 The problem is, I think,

30:10.560 --> 30:12.560
 because you paid us a subscription,

30:12.560 --> 30:14.560
 if we hadn't had the free tier,

30:14.560 --> 30:15.560
 where you would feel like,

30:15.560 --> 30:16.560
 even if I don't want to pay anymore,

30:16.560 --> 30:18.560
 I still get to keep them.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.560
 You keep your playlists forever.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.560
 They don't disappear even though you stop paying.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.560
 I think that was really important.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.560
 If we would have started as, you know,

30:25.560 --> 30:27.560
 you can put in all this time,

30:27.560 --> 30:29.560
 but if you stop paying, you lose all your work.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.560
 I think that would have been a big challenge

30:31.560 --> 30:33.560
 and was the big challenge for a lot of our competitors.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.560
 That's another reason why I think the free tier

30:35.560 --> 30:36.560
 is really important,

30:36.560 --> 30:38.560
 that people need to feel the security

30:38.560 --> 30:40.560
 that the work they put in, it will never disappear,

30:40.560 --> 30:42.560
 even if they decide not to pay.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.560
 I like how you put the work you put in.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.560
 I actually stopped even thinking of it that way.

30:46.560 --> 30:49.560
 Spotify taught me to just enjoy music

30:49.560 --> 30:53.560
 as opposed to what I was doing before,

30:53.560 --> 30:57.560
 which is like, in an unhealthy way, hoarding music.

30:57.560 --> 31:00.560
 Which I found that because I was doing that,

31:00.560 --> 31:03.560
 I was listening to a small selection of songs

31:03.560 --> 31:06.560
 way too much to where I was getting sick of them.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.560
 Whereas Spotify, the more liberating kind of approach,

31:09.560 --> 31:11.560
 I was just enjoying, of course,

31:11.560 --> 31:13.560
 I listened to Stairway to Heaven over and over,

31:13.560 --> 31:16.560
 but because of the extra variety,

31:16.560 --> 31:18.560
 I don't get as sick of them.

31:18.560 --> 31:21.560
 There's an interesting statistic I saw,

31:21.560 --> 31:24.560
 so Spotify has, maybe you can correct me,

31:24.560 --> 31:27.560
 but over 50 million songs, tracks,

31:27.560 --> 31:31.560
 and over 3 billion playlists.

31:31.560 --> 31:35.560
 So 50 million songs and 3 billion playlists.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.560
 60 times more playlists than songs.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.560
 What do you make of that?

31:40.560 --> 31:43.560
 So the way I think about it is that

31:43.560 --> 31:48.560
 from a statistical machine learning point of view,

31:48.560 --> 31:50.560
 you have all these,

31:50.560 --> 31:52.560
 if you want to think about reinforcement learning,

31:52.560 --> 31:54.560
 you have this state space of all the tracks,

31:54.560 --> 31:58.560
 and you can take different journeys through this world.

31:58.560 --> 32:02.560
 And I think of these as like people

32:02.560 --> 32:05.560
 helping themselves and each other,

32:05.560 --> 32:08.560
 creating interesting vectors through this space of tracks.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.560
 And then it's not so surprising that across

32:11.560 --> 32:14.560
 many tens of millions of atomic units,

32:14.560 --> 32:17.560
 there will be billions of paths that make sense.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.560
 And we're probably pretty quite far away from

32:20.560 --> 32:22.560
 having found all of them.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.560
 So kind of our job now is,

32:25.560 --> 32:28.560
 when Spotify started, it was really a search box

32:28.560 --> 32:30.560
 that was for the time pretty powerful,

32:30.560 --> 32:33.560
 and then I like to refer to this programming language

32:33.560 --> 32:35.560
 called playlisting, where if you,

32:35.560 --> 32:37.560
 as you probably were pretty good at music,

32:37.560 --> 32:39.560
 you knew your new releases, you knew your back catalog,

32:39.560 --> 32:41.560
 you knew you're starting with the heaven,

32:41.560 --> 32:43.560
 you could create a soundtrack for yourself

32:43.560 --> 32:45.560
 using this playlisting tool that's like metaprogramming language

32:45.560 --> 32:47.560
 for music to soundtrack your life.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.560
 And people who are good at music,

32:49.560 --> 32:51.560
 it's back to how do you scale the product.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.560
 For people who are good at music,

32:53.560 --> 32:55.560
 that wasn't actually enough.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.560
 If you had the catalog and a good search tool,

32:57.560 --> 32:59.560
 and you can create your own sessions,

32:59.560 --> 33:02.560
 you could create really good a soundtrack for your entire life.

33:02.560 --> 33:05.560
 Probably perfectly personalized because you did it yourself.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.560
 The problem was, many people aren't that good at music.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.560
 They just can't spend the time.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.560
 Even if you're very good at music, it's going to be hard to keep up.

33:11.560 --> 33:14.560
 So what we did to try to scale this

33:14.560 --> 33:17.560
 was to essentially try to build,

33:17.560 --> 33:19.560
 you can think of them as agents,

33:19.560 --> 33:21.560
 this friend that some people had

33:21.560 --> 33:23.560
 that helped them navigate this music catalog.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.560
 That's what we're trying to do for you.

33:25.560 --> 33:30.560
 But also, there is something like

33:30.560 --> 33:34.560
 200 million active users on Spotify.

33:34.560 --> 33:38.560
 So from the machine learning perspective,

33:38.560 --> 33:42.560
 you have these 200 million people plus.

33:42.560 --> 33:45.560
 They're creating,

33:45.560 --> 33:48.560
 it's really interesting to think of playlists

33:48.560 --> 33:52.560
 as, I don't know if you meant it that way,

33:52.560 --> 33:54.560
 but it's almost like a programming language.

33:54.560 --> 33:59.560
 It's released a trace of exploration

33:59.560 --> 34:03.560
 of those individual agents, the listeners.

34:03.560 --> 34:06.560
 And you have all this new tracks coming in.

34:06.560 --> 34:12.560
 So it's a fascinating space that is ripe for machine learning.

34:12.560 --> 34:18.560
 So how can playlists be used as data

34:18.560 --> 34:21.560
 in terms of machine learning

34:21.560 --> 34:24.560
 to help Spotify organize the music?

34:24.560 --> 34:27.560
 So we found in our data,

34:27.560 --> 34:30.560
 not surprising that people who playlisted lots,

34:30.560 --> 34:32.560
 they retained much better.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.560
 We had a great experience.

34:34.560 --> 34:37.560
 And so our first attempt was to playlist for users.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.560
 And so we acquired this company called Tunigo of editors

34:40.560 --> 34:43.560
 and professional playlisters

34:43.560 --> 34:47.560
 and kind of leveraged the maximum of human intelligence

34:47.560 --> 34:50.560
 to help build kind of these vectors

34:50.560 --> 34:53.560
 through the track space for people.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.560
 And that brought in the product.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.560
 Then the obvious next,

34:57.560 --> 34:59.560
 and we used statistical means

34:59.560 --> 35:02.560
 where they could see when they created a playlist,

35:02.560 --> 35:04.560
 how did that playlist perform?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.560
 They could see skips of the songs,

35:06.560 --> 35:08.560
 they could see how the songs perform,

35:08.560 --> 35:10.560
 and they manually iterated the playlist

35:10.560 --> 35:13.560
 to maximize performance for a large group of people.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.560
 But there were never enough editors to playlists for you personally.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.560
 So the promise of machine learning

35:18.560 --> 35:20.560
 was to go from kind of group personalization,

35:20.560 --> 35:23.560
 using editors and tools and statistics

35:23.560 --> 35:25.560
 to individualization.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.560
 And then what's so interesting

35:27.560 --> 35:29.560
 about three billion playlists we have is,

35:29.560 --> 35:31.560
 the truth is we lucked out.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.560
 This was not a priori strategy,

35:33.560 --> 35:35.560
 as is often the case.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.560
 It looks really smart in hindsight,

35:37.560 --> 35:39.560
 but it was dumb luck.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.560
 We looked at these playlists

35:41.560 --> 35:44.560
 and we had some people in the company,

35:44.560 --> 35:46.560
 a person named Erik Bernhardtson,

35:46.560 --> 35:48.560
 who was really good at machine learning

35:48.560 --> 35:51.560
 already back then, in like 2007, 2008.

35:51.560 --> 35:54.560
 Back then it was mostly collaborative filtering and so forth,

35:54.560 --> 35:57.560
 we realized that what this is,

35:57.560 --> 36:00.560
 is people are grouping tracks for themselves

36:00.560 --> 36:02.560
 that have some semantic meaning to them.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.560
 And then they actually label it

36:04.560 --> 36:06.560
 with a playlist name as well.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.560
 So in a sense, people were grouping tracks

36:09.560 --> 36:11.560
 along semantic dimensions and labeling them.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.560
 And so could you use that information

36:14.560 --> 36:18.560
 to find that latent embedding?

36:18.560 --> 36:21.560
 And so we started playing around

36:21.560 --> 36:23.560
 with collaborative filtering

36:23.560 --> 36:26.560
 and we saw tremendous success with it.

36:26.560 --> 36:30.560
 Basically trying to extract some of these dimensions.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.560
 And if you think about it, it's not surprising at all.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.560
 It would be quite surprising

36:35.560 --> 36:37.560
 if playlists were actually random,

36:37.560 --> 36:39.560
 if they had no semantic meaning.

36:39.560 --> 36:42.560
 For most people, they grouped these tracks for some reason.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.560
 So we just happened across this incredible data set

36:45.560 --> 36:48.560
 where people had taken these tens of millions of tracks

36:48.560 --> 36:52.560
 and grouped them along different semantic vectors.

36:52.560 --> 36:55.560
 And the semantics being outside the individual user,

36:55.560 --> 36:57.560
 so it's some kind of universal.

36:57.560 --> 36:59.560
 There's a universal embedding

36:59.560 --> 37:02.560
 that holds across people on this earth.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.560
 Yes, I do think that the embeddings you find

37:05.560 --> 37:08.560
 are going to be reflective of the people who play listed.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.560
 So if you have a lot of indie lovers who play list

37:11.560 --> 37:14.560
 your embedding is going to perform better there.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.560
 But what we found was that, yes,

37:17.560 --> 37:20.560
 there were these latent similarities.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.560
 They were very powerful.

37:22.560 --> 37:25.560
 And it was interesting because

37:25.560 --> 37:28.560
 I think that the people who play listed the most initially

37:28.560 --> 37:31.560
 were the so called music aficionados

37:31.560 --> 37:33.560
 who were really into music.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.560
 And they often had a certain...

37:35.560 --> 37:39.560
 Their taste was often geared towards a certain type of music.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.560
 And so what surprised us,

37:41.560 --> 37:43.560
 if you look at the problem from the outside,

37:43.560 --> 37:46.560
 you might expect that the algorithms

37:46.560 --> 37:49.560
 would start performing best with mainstreamers first

37:49.560 --> 37:52.560
 and now feels like an easier problem to solve mainstream taste

37:52.560 --> 37:54.560
 than really particular taste.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.560
 It was a complete opposite for us.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.560
 The recommendations performed fantastically

37:58.560 --> 38:01.560
 for people who saw themselves as having very unique taste.

38:01.560 --> 38:04.560
 That's probably because all of them play listed

38:04.560 --> 38:06.560
 and they didn't perform so well for mainstreamers.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.560
 They actually thought they were a bit too particular

38:09.560 --> 38:11.560
 and unorthodox.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.560
 So we had a complete opposite of what we expected.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.560
 Success within the hardest problem first

38:15.560 --> 38:18.560
 and then had to try to scale to more mainstream recommendations.

38:18.560 --> 38:21.560
 So you've also acquired

38:21.560 --> 38:23.560
 Echo Nest

38:23.560 --> 38:25.560
 that analyzes song data.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.560
 So

38:27.560 --> 38:29.560
 in your view, maybe you can talk about

38:29.560 --> 38:31.560
 so what kind of data is there

38:31.560 --> 38:33.560
 from a machine learning perspective?

38:33.560 --> 38:35.560
 There's a huge amount,

38:35.560 --> 38:37.560
 what we're talking about, play listing

38:37.560 --> 38:39.560
 and just user data

38:39.560 --> 38:42.560
 of what people are listening to, the playlist they're constructing

38:42.560 --> 38:44.560
 and so on.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.560
 And then there is the actual data within a song

38:47.560 --> 38:49.560
 what makes a song,

38:49.560 --> 38:52.560
 I don't know, the actual waveforms.

38:52.560 --> 38:55.560
 How do you mix the two?

38:55.560 --> 38:57.560
 How much values are in each?

38:57.560 --> 38:59.560
 To me, it seems like user data

38:59.560 --> 39:02.560
 is a romantic notion

39:02.560 --> 39:05.560
 that the song itself would contain useful information

39:05.560 --> 39:07.560
 but if I were to guess,

39:07.560 --> 39:09.560
 user data would be much more powerful.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.560
 Playlists would be much more powerful.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.560
 Yeah, so we use both.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.560
 Our biggest success initially was with

39:17.560 --> 39:20.560
 playlist data without understanding

39:20.560 --> 39:22.560
 anything about the structure of the song.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.560
 But when we acquired the Echo Nest,

39:24.560 --> 39:26.560
 they had the inverse problem.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.560
 They actually didn't have any play data.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.560
 They were a provider of recommendations

39:30.560 --> 39:32.560
 but they didn't actually have any play data.

39:32.560 --> 39:35.560
 So they looked at the structure of songs

39:35.560 --> 39:37.560
 sonically

39:37.560 --> 39:39.560
 and they looked at Wikipedia for cultural references

39:39.560 --> 39:41.560
 and so forth, right?

39:41.560 --> 39:43.560
 And did a lot of NLU and so forth.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.560
 They had that skill into the company

39:45.560 --> 39:48.560
 and combined our user data

39:48.560 --> 39:52.560
 with their content based.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.560
 So you can think of it as we were user based

39:54.560 --> 39:56.560
 and they were content based in their recommendations.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.560
 And we combined those two.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.560
 And for some cases where you have a new song

40:00.560 --> 40:02.560
 that has no play data,

40:02.560 --> 40:04.560
 obviously you have to try to go by

40:04.560 --> 40:06.560
 either who the artist is

40:06.560 --> 40:09.560
 or the sonic information in the song

40:09.560 --> 40:11.560
 or what it's similar to.

40:11.560 --> 40:13.560
 And we do a lot in both.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.560
 But I would say yes.

40:15.560 --> 40:17.560
 The user data captures things that

40:17.560 --> 40:19.560
 have to do with culture in the greater society

40:19.560 --> 40:21.560
 that you would never see

40:21.560 --> 40:23.560
 in the content itself.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.560
 But that said, we have seen

40:25.560 --> 40:27.560
 we have a research lab in Paris

40:27.560 --> 40:29.560
 when we can talk about

40:29.560 --> 40:31.560
 more about that on

40:31.560 --> 40:33.560
 kind of machine learning on the creator side.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.560
 What it can do for creators, not just for the consumers.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.560
 But where we looked at

40:37.560 --> 40:39.560
 how does the structure of a song actually affect

40:39.560 --> 40:41.560
 the listening behavior.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.560
 And it turns out that

40:43.560 --> 40:45.560
 we can predict things like skips

40:45.560 --> 40:47.560
 based on the song itself.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.560
 We could say that

40:49.560 --> 40:51.560
 maybe you should move that chorus a bit

40:51.560 --> 40:53.560
 because your skip is going to go up here.

40:53.560 --> 40:55.560
 There is a lot of latent structure in the music

40:55.560 --> 40:57.560
 which is not surprising

40:57.560 --> 40:59.560
 because it is some sort of mind hack.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.560
 So there should be structure.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.560
 That's probably what we respond to.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.560
 You just blew my mind actually

41:05.560 --> 41:07.560
 from the creator perspective.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.560
 That probably most creators

41:09.560 --> 41:11.560
 are not taken advantage of.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.560
 So I have recently

41:13.560 --> 41:15.560
 got to interact with a few

41:15.560 --> 41:17.560
 folks, YouTubers

41:17.560 --> 41:19.560
 who are

41:19.560 --> 41:21.560
 obsessed with this idea

41:21.560 --> 41:23.560
 of what do I

41:23.560 --> 41:25.560
 do to make sure people

41:25.560 --> 41:27.560
 keep watching the video.

41:27.560 --> 41:29.560
 And then you look at the analytics

41:29.560 --> 41:31.560
 of which point do people turn it off

41:31.560 --> 41:33.560
 and so on. First of all,

41:33.560 --> 41:35.560
 I don't think that's healthy.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.560
 It's because you can do it a little too much.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.560
 But it is a really

41:39.560 --> 41:41.560
 powerful tool for helping the creative process.

41:41.560 --> 41:43.560
 You just made me

41:43.560 --> 41:45.560
 realize you could do the same thing for

41:45.560 --> 41:47.560
 creation of music.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.560
 So is that something you've looked

41:49.560 --> 41:51.560
 into?

41:51.560 --> 41:53.560
 Can you speak

41:53.560 --> 41:55.560
 to how much opportunity there is for that kind of thing?

41:55.560 --> 41:57.560
 I listened to the podcast

41:57.560 --> 41:59.560
 with Zirash and I thought it was

41:59.560 --> 42:01.560
 fantastic and reacted to the same thing

42:01.560 --> 42:03.560
 where he said he posted something

42:03.560 --> 42:05.560
 in the morning, immediately

42:05.560 --> 42:07.560
 watched the feedback where the drop off was

42:07.560 --> 42:09.560
 and then responded to that in the afternoon.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.560
 Which is quite different

42:11.560 --> 42:13.560
 from how people make podcasts, for example.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.560
 The feedback loop is almost

42:15.560 --> 42:17.560
 non existent. So if we

42:17.560 --> 42:19.560
 back out at one level, I think

42:19.560 --> 42:21.560
 actually both for music

42:21.560 --> 42:23.560
 and podcasts, which we also

42:23.560 --> 42:25.560
 do at Spotify, I think there's

42:25.560 --> 42:27.560
 tremendous opportunity just

42:27.560 --> 42:29.560
 for the creation workflow.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.560
 I think it's really interesting

42:31.560 --> 42:33.560
 speaking to you, because you're

42:33.560 --> 42:35.560
 a musician, a developer and a

42:35.560 --> 42:37.560
 podcaster, if you think about those

42:37.560 --> 42:39.560
 three different roles,

42:39.560 --> 42:41.560
 if you make the leap as a musician,

42:41.560 --> 42:43.560
 if you think about it

42:43.560 --> 42:45.560
 as a software tool chain, really,

42:45.560 --> 42:47.560
 your door with the stems,

42:47.560 --> 42:49.560
 that's the IDE, right?

42:49.560 --> 42:51.560
 That's where you work in source code format

42:51.560 --> 42:53.560
 with what you're creating.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.560
 Then you sit around and you play with that

42:55.560 --> 42:57.560
 and when you're happy you compile that thing into

42:57.560 --> 42:59.560
 some sort of, you know, AAC,

42:59.560 --> 43:01.560
 or something, you do that because

43:01.560 --> 43:03.560
 you get distribution. There are so many run times

43:03.560 --> 43:05.560
 for that MP3 across the world in car stairs and stuff.

43:05.560 --> 43:07.560
 So you kind of compile this executable and you ship it out

43:07.560 --> 43:09.560
 in kind of an old fashioned

43:09.560 --> 43:11.560
 box software analogy.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.560
 And then you hope for the best,

43:13.560 --> 43:15.560
 right? But as

43:15.560 --> 43:17.560
 a software developer,

43:17.560 --> 43:19.560
 you would never do that. First you go

43:19.560 --> 43:21.560
 on GitHub and you collaborate with other creators.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.560
 And then, you know,

43:23.560 --> 43:25.560
 you think it would be crazy to just ship one version

43:25.560 --> 43:27.560
 of your software without doing an A.B. test,

43:27.560 --> 43:29.560
 without any feedback loop.

43:29.560 --> 43:31.560
 And then, issue tracking.

43:31.560 --> 43:33.560
 Exactly. And then you would look at the

43:33.560 --> 43:35.560
 feedback loops and try to optimize that thing, right?

43:35.560 --> 43:37.560
 So I think if you think

43:37.560 --> 43:39.560
 about it as a very specific software tool chain,

43:39.560 --> 43:41.560
 it looks

43:41.560 --> 43:43.560
 quite arcane.

43:43.560 --> 43:45.560
 The tools that a music creator has versus

43:45.560 --> 43:47.560
 what a software developer has.

43:47.560 --> 43:49.560
 So that's kind of how we think about it.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.560
 Why wouldn't

43:51.560 --> 43:53.560
 a music creator

43:53.560 --> 43:55.560
 have something like GitHub where you could collaborate

43:55.560 --> 43:57.560
 much more easily? So we bought

43:57.560 --> 43:59.560
 this company called Soundtrap,

43:59.560 --> 44:01.560
 which has a kind of

44:01.560 --> 44:03.560
 Google Docs for music approach where you can

44:03.560 --> 44:05.560
 collaborate with other people on the kind of

44:05.560 --> 44:07.560
 source code format with Stems.

44:07.560 --> 44:09.560
 And I think introducing things like

44:09.560 --> 44:11.560
 AI tools there to help you

44:11.560 --> 44:13.560
 as you're creating music,

44:13.560 --> 44:15.560
 both in

44:15.560 --> 44:17.560
 helping you

44:19.560 --> 44:21.560
 put a component to your music,

44:21.560 --> 44:23.560
 like drums or something,

44:23.560 --> 44:25.560
 help you

44:25.560 --> 44:27.560
 master and mix automatically,

44:27.560 --> 44:29.560
 help you understand how this track will perform.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.560
 Exactly what you would expect as a software

44:31.560 --> 44:33.560
 developer. I think it makes a lot of sense.

44:33.560 --> 44:35.560
 And I think the same goes for

44:35.560 --> 44:37.560
 a podcaster. I think podcasters will expect

44:37.560 --> 44:39.560
 to have the same kind of feedback loop that Sirosh

44:39.560 --> 44:41.560
 has. Like,

44:41.560 --> 44:43.560
 why wouldn't you? Maybe it's not healthy, but

44:43.560 --> 44:45.560
 Sorry, I wanted to

44:45.560 --> 44:47.560
 criticize the fact because you can overdo it.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.560
 Because a lot of the

44:49.560 --> 44:51.560
 and we're in a new era

44:51.560 --> 44:53.560
 of that.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.560
 So you can become

44:55.560 --> 44:57.560
 addicted to it and

44:57.560 --> 44:59.560
 therefore

44:59.560 --> 45:01.560
 what people say you become a slave to the YouTube

45:01.560 --> 45:03.560
 algorithm.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.560
 It's always a danger

45:05.560 --> 45:07.560
 of a new technology as opposed to

45:07.560 --> 45:09.560
 say if you're creating a song

45:09.560 --> 45:11.560
 becoming too obsessed

45:11.560 --> 45:13.560
 about the

45:13.560 --> 45:15.560
 intro riff to the song

45:15.560 --> 45:17.560
 that keeps people listening versus

45:17.560 --> 45:19.560
 actually the entirety of the creation process. It's a balance.

45:19.560 --> 45:21.560
 But the fact that

45:21.560 --> 45:23.560
 there's zero, I mean you're blowing my mind right now

45:23.560 --> 45:25.560
 because you're

45:25.560 --> 45:27.560
 completely right that there's no

45:27.560 --> 45:29.560
 signal whatsoever. There's no feedback

45:29.560 --> 45:31.560
 whatsoever on the creation process

45:31.560 --> 45:33.560
 and musical podcasting

45:33.560 --> 45:35.560
 almost at all.

45:35.560 --> 45:37.560
 And are you saying

45:37.560 --> 45:39.560
 that Spotify

45:39.560 --> 45:41.560
 is hoping to help create tools

45:41.560 --> 45:43.560
 to, not tools, but

45:43.560 --> 45:45.560
 No, tools actually.

45:45.560 --> 45:47.560
 Actually tools for creators.

45:47.560 --> 45:49.560
 Absolutely.

45:49.560 --> 45:51.560
 So we have

45:51.560 --> 45:53.560
 we've made some acquisitions the last few years around music creation

45:53.560 --> 45:55.560
 this company called Soundtrap

45:55.560 --> 45:57.560
 which is a digital audio workstation

45:57.560 --> 45:59.560
 that is browser based

45:59.560 --> 46:01.560
 and their focus was really the Google Docs approach.

46:01.560 --> 46:03.560
 We can collaborate with people much more easily

46:03.560 --> 46:05.560
 than you could in previous tools.

46:05.560 --> 46:07.560
 So we have some of these tools

46:07.560 --> 46:09.560
 that we're working with that we want to make accessible

46:09.560 --> 46:11.560
 and then we can connect it

46:11.560 --> 46:13.560
 with our consumption data.

46:13.560 --> 46:15.560
 We can create this feedback loop where

46:15.560 --> 46:17.560
 we could help you understand

46:17.560 --> 46:19.560
 we could help you create

46:19.560 --> 46:21.560
 and help you understand how you will perform.

46:21.560 --> 46:23.560
 We also acquired this other company

46:23.560 --> 46:25.560
 with a podcasting called Anchor

46:25.560 --> 46:27.560
 which is one of the biggest podcasting tools

46:27.560 --> 46:29.560
 mobile focused.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.560
 So really focused on simple creation

46:31.560 --> 46:33.560
 or easy access to creation

46:33.560 --> 46:35.560
 but that also gives us this feedback loop

46:35.560 --> 46:37.560
 and even before that

46:37.560 --> 46:39.560
 we invested in something called

46:39.560 --> 46:41.560
 Spotify for Artists

46:41.560 --> 46:43.560
 and Spotify for Podcasters

46:43.560 --> 46:45.560
 which is an app that you can download

46:45.560 --> 46:47.560
 you can verify that you are that creator

46:47.560 --> 46:49.560
 and then you get

46:49.560 --> 46:51.560
 things that

46:51.560 --> 46:53.560
 software developers have had for years.

46:53.560 --> 46:55.560
 You can see where

46:55.560 --> 46:57.560
 if you look at your podcast for example on Spotify

46:57.560 --> 46:59.560
 or a song that you released

46:59.560 --> 47:01.560
 you can see how it's performing

47:01.560 --> 47:03.560
 which citizen it's performing in

47:03.560 --> 47:05.560
 who's listening to it, what's the demographic breakup

47:05.560 --> 47:07.560
 so similar in the sense that

47:07.560 --> 47:09.560
 you can understand how you're actually doing on the platform.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.560
 So we definitely want

47:11.560 --> 47:13.560
 to build tools. I think

47:13.560 --> 47:15.560
 you also interviewed

47:15.560 --> 47:17.560
 the head of research for Adobe

47:17.560 --> 47:19.560
 and I think that's

47:19.560 --> 47:21.560
 back to Photoshop that you like.

47:21.560 --> 47:23.560
 I think that's an interesting analogy as well.

47:23.560 --> 47:25.560
 Photoshop I think has been

47:25.560 --> 47:27.560
 very innovative in helping

47:27.560 --> 47:29.560
 photographers and artists

47:29.560 --> 47:31.560
 and I think there should be

47:31.560 --> 47:33.560
 the same kind of tools for

47:33.560 --> 47:35.560
 music creators where you could get

47:35.560 --> 47:37.560
 AI assistants for example as you're creating music

47:37.560 --> 47:39.560
 as you can do

47:39.560 --> 47:41.560
 with Adobe where you can

47:41.560 --> 47:43.560
 I want a sky over here and you can get help creating that sky.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.560
 The really fascinating thing is

47:45.560 --> 47:47.560
 what Adobe

47:47.560 --> 47:49.560
 doesn't have

47:49.560 --> 47:51.560
 is a distribution for the content

47:51.560 --> 47:53.560
 you create. So you don't have

47:53.560 --> 47:55.560
 the data of if I create

47:55.560 --> 47:57.560
 if I

47:57.560 --> 47:59.560
 you know whatever creation I make

47:59.560 --> 48:01.560
 in Photoshop or Premiere

48:01.560 --> 48:03.560
 I can't get like immediate feedback

48:03.560 --> 48:05.560
 like I can on YouTube for example about

48:05.560 --> 48:07.560
 the way people are responding

48:07.560 --> 48:09.560
 and if Spotify is creating those tools

48:09.560 --> 48:11.560
 that's a really exciting

48:11.560 --> 48:13.560
 actually world

48:13.560 --> 48:15.560
 but

48:15.560 --> 48:17.560
 let's talk a little about podcasts

48:17.560 --> 48:19.560
 so I have trouble

48:19.560 --> 48:21.560
 talking to one person

48:21.560 --> 48:23.560
 so it's a bit terrifying

48:23.560 --> 48:25.560
 and kind of hard to fathom

48:25.560 --> 48:27.560
 but on average

48:27.560 --> 48:29.560
 60 to 100,000

48:29.560 --> 48:31.560
 people will listen to this episode

48:31.560 --> 48:33.560
 okay so

48:33.560 --> 48:35.560
 it's intimidating

48:35.560 --> 48:37.560
 so I hosted on Blueberry

48:37.560 --> 48:39.560
 I don't know if I'm pronouncing

48:39.560 --> 48:41.560
 that correctly actually

48:41.560 --> 48:43.560
 it looks like most people listen to it on Apple

48:43.560 --> 48:45.560
 Podcast, Cast Box and Pocket

48:45.560 --> 48:47.560
 Cast and only about

48:47.560 --> 48:49.560
 a thousand

48:49.560 --> 48:51.560
 listen on Spotify

48:51.560 --> 48:53.560
 just my podcast right

48:53.560 --> 48:55.560
 so

48:55.560 --> 48:57.560
 where

48:57.560 --> 48:59.560
 do you see a time when Spotify

48:59.560 --> 49:01.560
 will dominate this so Spotify

49:01.560 --> 49:03.560
 is relatively new

49:03.560 --> 49:05.560
 in podcasting

49:05.560 --> 49:07.560
 so yeah in podcasting

49:07.560 --> 49:09.560
 what's the deal with podcasting in Spotify

49:09.560 --> 49:11.560
 how serious

49:11.560 --> 49:13.560
 is Spotify about podcasting

49:13.560 --> 49:15.560
 do you see a time where everybody would listen

49:15.560 --> 49:17.560
 to you know probably

49:17.560 --> 49:19.560
 a huge amount of people, majority perhaps

49:19.560 --> 49:21.560
 listen to music on Spotify

49:21.560 --> 49:23.560
 do you see a time

49:23.560 --> 49:25.560
 when the same is true for

49:25.560 --> 49:27.560
 podcasting

49:27.560 --> 49:29.560
 well I certainly hope so that is our mission

49:29.560 --> 49:31.560
 our mission as a company is actually to

49:31.560 --> 49:33.560
 enable a million creators to live

49:33.560 --> 49:35.560
 off of their art and a billion people inspired

49:35.560 --> 49:37.560
 by it and what I think is interesting about that mission

49:37.560 --> 49:39.560
 is it actually puts the creators

49:39.560 --> 49:41.560
 first even though it started as a

49:41.560 --> 49:43.560
 consumer focused company and it says

49:43.560 --> 49:45.560
 to be able to live off of their art not just

49:45.560 --> 49:47.560
 make some money off of their art as well

49:47.560 --> 49:49.560
 so it's quite an ambitious

49:49.560 --> 49:51.560
 product and

49:51.560 --> 49:53.560
 so we think about creators of all kinds

49:53.560 --> 49:55.560
 and

49:55.560 --> 49:57.560
 we kind of expanded our mission from

49:57.560 --> 49:59.560
 being music to being audio

49:59.560 --> 50:01.560
 a while back

50:01.560 --> 50:03.560
 and that's not

50:03.560 --> 50:05.560
 so much because

50:05.560 --> 50:07.560
 we think we made that decision

50:07.560 --> 50:09.560
 we think that decision

50:09.560 --> 50:11.560
 was made for us

50:11.560 --> 50:13.560
 we think the world made that decision

50:13.560 --> 50:15.560
 whether we like it or not

50:15.560 --> 50:17.560
 when you put in your headphones

50:17.560 --> 50:19.560
 you're going to make a choice between

50:19.560 --> 50:21.560
 music

50:21.560 --> 50:23.560
 and a new episode of

50:23.560 --> 50:25.560
 your podcast or something else

50:25.560 --> 50:27.560
 we're in that world whether we like it or not

50:27.560 --> 50:29.560
 that's how radio work

50:29.560 --> 50:31.560
 so we decided that

50:31.560 --> 50:33.560
 we think it's about audio you can see the

50:33.560 --> 50:35.560
 rights of audio books and so forth

50:35.560 --> 50:37.560
 we think audio is this great opportunity

50:37.560 --> 50:39.560
 so we decided to enter it and obviously

50:39.560 --> 50:41.560
 Apple

50:41.560 --> 50:43.560
 and Apple podcast is absolutely

50:43.560 --> 50:45.560
 dominating in

50:45.560 --> 50:47.560
 podcasting and we didn't have

50:47.560 --> 50:49.560
 a single podcast only like two years ago

50:49.560 --> 50:51.560
 what we did though was

50:51.560 --> 50:53.560
 we

50:53.560 --> 50:55.560
 we looked at this and said

50:55.560 --> 50:57.560
 bring something to this

50:57.560 --> 50:59.560
 we want to do this but back to the original

50:59.560 --> 51:01.560
 Spotify we had to do something that consumers actually value

51:03.560 --> 51:05.560
 to be able to do this and the reason

51:05.560 --> 51:07.560
 we've gone from not existing at all

51:07.560 --> 51:09.560
 to being the

51:09.560 --> 51:11.560
 quite a wide margin the second largest podcast

51:11.560 --> 51:13.560
 consumption

51:13.560 --> 51:15.560
 still wide gap to iTunes but we're growing

51:15.560 --> 51:17.560
 quite fast

51:17.560 --> 51:19.560
 I think it's because when we looked at the consumer

51:19.560 --> 51:21.560
 problem

51:21.560 --> 51:23.560
 people said surprisingly that they wanted their podcasts

51:23.560 --> 51:25.560
 and music in the same

51:25.560 --> 51:27.560
 in the same application

51:27.560 --> 51:29.560
 so what we did was we took a little bit of a different

51:29.560 --> 51:31.560
 approach what we said instead of building a separate podcast

51:31.560 --> 51:33.560
 app

51:33.560 --> 51:35.560
 we thought is there a consumer problem to solve here

51:35.560 --> 51:37.560
 because the others are very successful already

51:37.560 --> 51:39.560
 and we thought there was in making a more

51:39.560 --> 51:41.560
 seamless experience where you can have your podcasts

51:41.560 --> 51:43.560
 and your music

51:43.560 --> 51:45.560
 in the same application

51:45.560 --> 51:47.560
 because we think it's audio to you

51:47.560 --> 51:49.560
 and that has been successful and that meant that

51:49.560 --> 51:51.560
 we actually had 200 million people

51:51.560 --> 51:53.560
 to offer this to instead of starting from zero

51:53.560 --> 51:55.560
 so I think we have a good

51:55.560 --> 51:57.560
 chance because we're taking a different approach

51:57.560 --> 51:59.560
 than the competition and back to the other thing

51:59.560 --> 52:01.560
 I mentioned about

52:01.560 --> 52:03.560
 creators

52:03.560 --> 52:05.560
 because we're looking at the end to end flow

52:05.560 --> 52:07.560
 I think there's a tremendous amount of innovation

52:07.560 --> 52:09.560
 to do around podcast as a format

52:09.560 --> 52:11.560
 when we have creation tools and consumption

52:11.560 --> 52:13.560
 I think we could

52:13.560 --> 52:15.560
 start improving what podcasting is

52:15.560 --> 52:17.560
 I mean podcast is this

52:17.560 --> 52:19.560
 this opaque big like one to

52:19.560 --> 52:21.560
 your file

52:21.560 --> 52:23.560
 that you're streaming

52:23.560 --> 52:25.560
 which it really doesn't make that much sense in 2019

52:25.560 --> 52:27.560
 that it's not interactive

52:27.560 --> 52:29.560
 there's no feedback loops nothing like that

52:29.560 --> 52:31.560
 so I think if we're going to win it's going to have to be

52:31.560 --> 52:33.560
 because we build a better product

52:33.560 --> 52:35.560
 for creators and for consumers

52:35.560 --> 52:37.560
 so we'll see but it's certainly our goal

52:37.560 --> 52:39.560
 we have a long way to go

52:39.560 --> 52:41.560
 well the creators part is really exciting

52:41.560 --> 52:43.560
 you got me hooked there

52:43.560 --> 52:45.560
 it's the only stats I have

52:45.560 --> 52:47.560
 Blueberry just recently added the stats of

52:47.560 --> 52:49.560
 it's listen to the end

52:49.560 --> 52:51.560
 or not

52:51.560 --> 52:53.560
 and that's like a huge improvement

52:53.560 --> 52:55.560
 but that's still

52:55.560 --> 52:57.560
 nowhere to where you could possibly

52:57.560 --> 52:59.560
 go into statistics

52:59.560 --> 53:01.560
 just download the Spotify podcasters up and verify

53:01.560 --> 53:03.560
 and then you'll know where people dropped out in this episode

53:03.560 --> 53:05.560
 oh wow okay

53:05.560 --> 53:07.560
 the moment I started talking

53:07.560 --> 53:09.560
 I might be depressed by this

53:09.560 --> 53:11.560
 but okay so one

53:11.560 --> 53:13.560
 one other question

53:13.560 --> 53:15.560
 the original

53:15.560 --> 53:17.560
 Spotify for music

53:17.560 --> 53:19.560
 and I have a question about

53:19.560 --> 53:21.560
 podcasting in this line

53:21.560 --> 53:23.560
 is the idea of albums

53:23.560 --> 53:25.560
 I have

53:25.560 --> 53:27.560
 music aficionados

53:27.560 --> 53:29.560
 friends who are really

53:29.560 --> 53:31.560
 big fans of music

53:31.560 --> 53:33.560
 often really enjoy albums

53:33.560 --> 53:35.560
 listening to entire albums of

53:35.560 --> 53:37.560
 an artist correct me if I'm wrong

53:37.560 --> 53:39.560
 but I feel like

53:39.560 --> 53:41.560
 Spotify has helped

53:41.560 --> 53:43.560
 replace the idea of an album with playlists

53:43.560 --> 53:45.560
 so you create your own albums

53:45.560 --> 53:47.560
 that's kind of the way

53:47.560 --> 53:49.560
 at least I've experienced music

53:49.560 --> 53:51.560
 and I've really enjoyed it that way

53:51.560 --> 53:53.560
 one of the things that was missing

53:53.560 --> 53:55.560
 in podcasting for me

53:55.560 --> 53:57.560
 I don't know if it's missing I don't know

53:57.560 --> 53:59.560
 it's an open question for me

53:59.560 --> 54:01.560
 but the way I listen to podcasts is the way I would listen to albums

54:01.560 --> 54:03.560
 so I take

54:03.560 --> 54:05.560
 Joe Rogan Experience

54:05.560 --> 54:07.560
 and that's an album and I listen

54:07.560 --> 54:09.560
 I put that on

54:09.560 --> 54:11.560
 and I listen one episode after the next

54:11.560 --> 54:13.560
 and there's a sequence and so on

54:13.560 --> 54:15.560
 is there room for

54:15.560 --> 54:17.560
 doing

54:17.560 --> 54:19.560
 what Spotify did for music

54:19.560 --> 54:21.560
 but creating

54:21.560 --> 54:23.560
 playlists

54:23.560 --> 54:25.560
 sort of this kind of playlisting

54:25.560 --> 54:27.560
 idea of breaking apart from podcasting

54:27.560 --> 54:29.560
 from individual

54:29.560 --> 54:31.560
 podcasts and creating kind of

54:31.560 --> 54:33.560
 this interplay

54:33.560 --> 54:35.560
 or have you thought about that

54:35.560 --> 54:37.560
 it's a great question so I think in

54:37.560 --> 54:39.560
 music

54:39.560 --> 54:41.560
 you're right basically you bought an album

54:41.560 --> 54:43.560
 so it was like you bought a small catalog of

54:43.560 --> 54:45.560
 10 tracks

54:45.560 --> 54:47.560
 again it was actually a lot of consumption

54:47.560 --> 54:49.560
 you think it's about what you like

54:49.560 --> 54:51.560
 but it's based on the business model

54:51.560 --> 54:53.560
 you paid for this 10 track

54:53.560 --> 54:55.560
 service and then you listen to that for a while

54:55.560 --> 54:57.560
 and then when everything was flat

54:57.560 --> 54:59.560
 priced you tended to listen differently

54:59.560 --> 55:01.560
 now so I think

55:01.560 --> 55:03.560
 the album is still tremendously important that's why we have it

55:03.560 --> 55:05.560
 and you can save albums and so forth

55:05.560 --> 55:07.560
 and you have a huge amount of people who really listen

55:07.560 --> 55:09.560
 according to albums and I like that because

55:09.560 --> 55:11.560
 it is a creator format you can tell a longer

55:11.560 --> 55:13.560
 story over several tracks

55:13.560 --> 55:15.560
 and so some people listen to just one track

55:15.560 --> 55:17.560
 some people actually want to hear that whole

55:17.560 --> 55:19.560
 story

55:19.560 --> 55:21.560
 now in podcast I think

55:21.560 --> 55:23.560
 I think it's different

55:23.560 --> 55:25.560
 you can argue that podcasts might be more

55:25.560 --> 55:27.560
 like shows on Netflix

55:27.560 --> 55:29.560
 you have like a full season of Narcos

55:29.560 --> 55:31.560
 and you're probably not going to do like one

55:31.560 --> 55:33.560
 episode of Narcos and then one of House of Cards

55:33.560 --> 55:35.560
 like you know

55:35.560 --> 55:37.560
 there's a narrative there

55:37.560 --> 55:39.560
 and you love the cast

55:39.560 --> 55:41.560
 and you love these characters

55:41.560 --> 55:43.560
 so I think people love shows

55:43.560 --> 55:45.560
 and I think they will

55:45.560 --> 55:47.560
 listen to those shows

55:47.560 --> 55:49.560
 I do think you follow a bunch of shows at the same time

55:49.560 --> 55:51.560
 so there's certainly an opportunity to bring you the

55:51.560 --> 55:53.560
 latest episode of

55:53.560 --> 55:55.560
 whatever the 5, 6, 10 things that you're into

55:55.560 --> 55:57.560
 but I think

55:57.560 --> 55:59.560
 I think people are going to listen

55:59.560 --> 56:01.560
 to specific hosts

56:01.560 --> 56:03.560
 and love those hosts

56:03.560 --> 56:05.560
 for a long time because I think there's something

56:05.560 --> 56:07.560
 different with podcasts

56:07.560 --> 56:09.560
 where this format

56:09.560 --> 56:11.560
 of the

56:11.560 --> 56:13.560
 experience of the audience

56:13.560 --> 56:15.560
 is actually standing here right between us

56:15.560 --> 56:17.560
 whereas if you look at something on TV

56:17.560 --> 56:19.560
 the audio actually would come from

56:19.560 --> 56:21.560
 you would sit over there and the audio would come to you

56:21.560 --> 56:23.560
 from both of us as if you were watching

56:23.560 --> 56:25.560
 not as if you were part of the conversation

56:25.560 --> 56:27.560
 so my experience of having to listen to podcasts

56:27.560 --> 56:29.560
 like yours and Joe Rogan

56:29.560 --> 56:31.560
 I feel like I know all of these people

56:31.560 --> 56:33.560
 and I have no idea who I am

56:33.560 --> 56:35.560
 but I feel like I've listened to so many hours of them

56:35.560 --> 56:37.560
 it's very different from me watching

56:37.560 --> 56:39.560
 like a TV show or an interview

56:39.560 --> 56:41.560
 so I think you kind of

56:41.560 --> 56:43.560
 fall in love with people

56:43.560 --> 56:45.560
 and experience in a different way

56:45.560 --> 56:47.560
 so I think shows and hosts

56:47.560 --> 56:49.560
 are going to be very important

56:49.560 --> 56:51.560
 I don't think that's going to go away into some sort of thing

56:51.560 --> 56:53.560
 where you don't even know who you're listening to

56:53.560 --> 56:55.560
 I don't think that's going to happen

56:55.560 --> 56:57.560
 what I do think is, I think there's a tremendous

56:57.560 --> 56:59.560
 discovery opportunity

56:59.560 --> 57:01.560
 in podcasts because

57:01.560 --> 57:03.560
 the catalogue is growing quite quickly

57:03.560 --> 57:05.560
 and

57:05.560 --> 57:07.560
 I think podcasts is only

57:07.560 --> 57:09.560
 a few like five, six hundred thousand

57:09.560 --> 57:11.560
 shows right now

57:11.560 --> 57:13.560
 if you look back to YouTube as another analogy

57:13.560 --> 57:15.560
 for creators, no one really knows

57:15.560 --> 57:17.560
 if you would lift the lid on

57:17.560 --> 57:19.560
 YouTube but it's probably billions

57:19.560 --> 57:21.560
 of episodes

57:21.560 --> 57:23.560
 and so I think the podcast catalogue would probably grow

57:23.560 --> 57:25.560
 tremendously because the creation

57:25.560 --> 57:27.560
 tools are getting easier

57:27.560 --> 57:29.560
 and you're going to have this

57:29.560 --> 57:31.560
 discovery opportunity that I think is really big

57:31.560 --> 57:33.560
 so a lot of people tell me that they love their shows

57:33.560 --> 57:35.560
 but discovering

57:35.560 --> 57:37.560
 podcasts kind of suck

57:37.560 --> 57:39.560
 it's really hard to get into new show

57:39.560 --> 57:41.560
 they're usually quite long, it's a big time investment

57:41.560 --> 57:43.560
 so I think there's plenty of opportunity

57:43.560 --> 57:45.560
 in the discovery part

57:45.560 --> 57:47.560
 yeah for sure, a hundred percent

57:47.560 --> 57:49.560
 and even the dumbest

57:49.560 --> 57:51.560
 there's so many low hanging fruit too

57:51.560 --> 57:53.560
 for example

57:53.560 --> 57:55.560
 just knowing

57:55.560 --> 57:57.560
 what episode to listen to first

57:57.560 --> 57:59.560
 to try out a podcast

57:59.560 --> 58:01.560
 exactly because most podcasts

58:01.560 --> 58:03.560
 don't have an order to them

58:03.560 --> 58:05.560
 they can be listened to out of order

58:05.560 --> 58:07.560
 and

58:07.560 --> 58:09.560
 sorry to say

58:09.560 --> 58:11.560
 some are better than others

58:11.560 --> 58:13.560
 episodes so some episodes of Joe Rogan

58:13.560 --> 58:15.560
 are better than others

58:15.560 --> 58:17.560
 and it's nice to know

58:17.560 --> 58:19.560
 which you should listen to

58:19.560 --> 58:21.560
 to try it out and there's as far

58:21.560 --> 58:23.560
 as I know almost no information

58:23.560 --> 58:25.560
 in terms of

58:25.560 --> 58:27.560
 like upvotes

58:27.560 --> 58:29.560
 on how good an episode is

58:29.560 --> 58:31.560
 so I think part of the problem is

58:31.560 --> 58:33.560
 it's kind of like music

58:33.560 --> 58:35.560
 there isn't one answer, people use music for different things

58:35.560 --> 58:37.560
 and there's actually many different types of music

58:37.560 --> 58:39.560
 there's workout music and there's classical piano music

58:39.560 --> 58:41.560
 and focus music and

58:41.560 --> 58:43.560
 and so forth

58:43.560 --> 58:45.560
 I think the same with podcasts, some podcasts are sequential

58:45.560 --> 58:47.560
 they're supposed to be listened to

58:47.560 --> 58:49.560
 in order

58:49.560 --> 58:51.560
 it's actually telling and narrative

58:51.560 --> 58:53.560
 podcasts are one topic

58:53.560 --> 58:55.560
 kind of like yours but different guests

58:55.560 --> 58:57.560
 so you could jump in anywhere

58:57.560 --> 58:59.560
 some podcasts actually have completely different topics

58:59.560 --> 59:01.560
 and for those podcasts it might be that

59:01.560 --> 59:03.560
 we should recommend

59:03.560 --> 59:05.560
 one episode because it's about AI

59:05.560 --> 59:07.560
 from someone

59:07.560 --> 59:09.560
 but then they talk about something that you're not interested in

59:09.560 --> 59:11.560
 the rest of the episode

59:11.560 --> 59:13.560
 so I think what we're spending a lot of time on now

59:13.560 --> 59:15.560
 is just first understanding the domain

59:15.560 --> 59:17.560
 and creating kind of the knowledge graph

59:17.560 --> 59:19.560
 of

59:19.560 --> 59:21.560
 how do these objects relate

59:21.560 --> 59:23.560
 and how do people consume and I think we'll find that it's going to be

59:23.560 --> 59:25.560
 it's going to be different

59:25.560 --> 59:27.560
 I'm excited

59:27.560 --> 59:29.560
 Spotify is the first

59:29.560 --> 59:31.560
 people I'm aware of that are

59:31.560 --> 59:33.560
 trying to do this

59:33.560 --> 59:35.560
 for podcasting

59:35.560 --> 59:37.560
 podcasting has been like a wild west

59:37.560 --> 59:39.560
 until now

59:39.560 --> 59:41.560
 we want to be very careful though

59:41.560 --> 59:43.560
 because it's been a very good wild west

59:43.560 --> 59:45.560
 I think it's this fragile ecosystem

59:45.560 --> 59:47.560
 and

59:47.560 --> 59:49.560
 we want to make sure that

59:49.560 --> 59:51.560
 you don't barge in and say

59:51.560 --> 59:53.560
 we're going to internetize this thing

59:53.560 --> 59:55.560
 and you have to think about

59:55.560 --> 59:57.560
 the creators, you have to understand

59:57.560 --> 59:59.560
 how they get distribution today

59:59.560 --> 1:00:01.560
 who listens to how they make money today

1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:03.560
 try to

1:00:03.560 --> 1:00:05.560
 make sure that their business model works, that they understand

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.560
 I think it's back to doing something

1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:09.560
 improving their products

1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:11.560
 like feedback loops and distribution

1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:15.560
 jumping back into terms of this

1:00:15.560 --> 1:00:17.560
 fascinating world of

1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:19.560
 recommender system and listening to music

1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:21.560
 and using machine learning to analyze things

1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:23.560
 do you think it's better

1:00:23.560 --> 1:00:25.560
 to

1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:27.560
 what currently

1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:29.560
 correct me if I'm wrong but

1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:31.560
 Spotify lets people pick what they listen to

1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:33.560
 for the most part

1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:35.560
 there's a discovery process but you kind of

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:37.560
 organize playlists

1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:39.560
 is it better to let people pick

1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:41.560
 what they listen to or recommend

1:00:41.560 --> 1:00:43.560
 what they should listen to

1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:45.560
 something like stations by Spotify

1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:47.560
 that I saw that you're playing around with

1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:49.560
 maybe you can tell me

1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:51.560
 what's the status of that

1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:53.560
 this is a Pandora style app

1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:55.560
 that just kind of as opposed to you select

1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:57.560
 the music you listen to

1:00:57.560 --> 1:00:59.560
 it kind of feeds you

1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:01.560
 the music you listen to

1:01:01.560 --> 1:01:03.560
 what's the status of stations by Spotify

1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:05.560
 what's its future

1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:07.560
 the store is Spotify as we have grown

1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:09.560
 has been that we made it more accessible

1:01:09.560 --> 1:01:11.560
 to different audiences

1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:13.560
 and

1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:15.560
 stations is another one of those where

1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:17.560
 the question is

1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:19.560
 some people want to be very specific

1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:21.560
 they actually want to start with heaven right now

1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:23.560
 that needs to be very easy to do

1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:25.560
 and some people or even the same person

1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:27.560
 at some point might say

1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:29.560
 I want to feel upbeat

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:31.560
 or I want to feel happy

1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:33.560
 or I want songs to sing in the car

1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:35.560
 so they put in the information

1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:37.560
 at a very different level

1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:39.560
 and then we need to translate that into

1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:41.560
 musically

1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:43.560
 so stations is a test to

1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:45.560
 create like a consumption input vector

1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:47.560
 that is much simpler where you can just tune it a little bit

1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:49.560
 and see if that increases the overall reach

1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:51.560
 but we're trying to kind of serve

1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:53.560
 the entire gamut of super advanced

1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:55.560
 so called music aficionados

1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:57.560
 all the way to

1:01:57.560 --> 1:01:59.560
 to people who

1:01:59.560 --> 1:02:01.560
 they love listening to music but it's not

1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:03.560
 their number one priority in life

1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:05.560
 they're not going to sit and follow every new release

1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:07.560
 from every new artist

1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:09.560
 to influence music at

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:11.560
 at a different level

1:02:11.560 --> 1:02:13.560
 so we're trying, you can think of it as different

1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:15.560
 products and I think when

1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:17.560
 one of the interesting things

1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:19.560
 to answer your question on

1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:21.560
 if it's better to lift the user choose

1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:23.560
 or to play I think the answer is

1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:25.560
 the challenge when you

1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:27.560
 when machine learning kind of came along

1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:29.560
 there was a lot of thinking about

1:02:29.560 --> 1:02:31.560
 what does product development mean

1:02:31.560 --> 1:02:33.560
 in a machine learning context

1:02:33.560 --> 1:02:35.560
 people like Andrew Eng for example

1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:37.560
 when he went to Baidu

1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:39.560
 he started doing a lot of practical machine learning

1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:41.560
 went from academia and he thought a lot about this

1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:43.560
 and he had this notion that

1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:45.560
 you know product manager, designer

1:02:45.560 --> 1:02:47.560
 and they used to work around this wireframe

1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:49.560
 kind of describe what the product should look like

1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:51.560
 was something to talk about when you're doing

1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:53.560
 like a chat bot or a playlist

1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:55.560
 what are you going to say like it should be good

1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:57.560
 that's not a good product description

1:02:57.560 --> 1:02:59.560
 so how do you do that and he came up with this notion

1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:01.560
 that

1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:03.560
 the test set is the new wireframe

1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:05.560
 and the job of the product manager is to source

1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:07.560
 a good test set that is representative of what

1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:09.560
 like if you say like I want to play this

1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:11.560
 that is songsticing in the car

1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:13.560
 job of the product manager to go and source

1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:15.560
 like a good test set of what that means

1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:17.560
 then you can work with engineering to have algorithms

1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:19.560
 to try to produce that right

1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:21.560
 so we try to think a lot about

1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:23.560
 how to structure product development

1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:25.560
 for machine learning

1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:27.560
 age and what we discovered

1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:29.560
 was that a lot of it is actually in the expectation

1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:31.560
 and you can go

1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:33.560
 you can go two ways so

1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:37.560
 let's say that

1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:39.560
 if you set the expectation with the user

1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:41.560
 that this is a discovery product like Discover Weekly

1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:43.560
 you're actually setting

1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:45.560
 the expectation that most of what we show you will not be

1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:47.560
 relevant when you're in the discovery

1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:49.560
 process you're going to accept that

1:03:49.560 --> 1:03:51.560
 actually if you find one gem every Monday

1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:53.560
 that you totally love

1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:55.560
 you're probably going to be happy

1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:57.560
 even though the statistical meaning

1:03:57.560 --> 1:03:59.560
 1 out of 10 is terrible or 1 out of 20

1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:01.560
 is terrible from a user point of view

1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:03.560
 because the setting was discovered it's fine

1:04:03.560 --> 1:04:05.560
 can I start to interrupt real quick

1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:07.560
 I just actually learned about Discover Weekly

1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:09.560
 which is a Spotify

1:04:09.560 --> 1:04:11.560
 I don't know

1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:13.560
 it's a feature of Spotify that shows you

1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:15.560
 cool songs to listen

1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:17.560
 maybe I can do

1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:19.560
 issue tracking I couldn't find it on my Spotify app

1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:21.560
 it's in your library

1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:23.560
 it's in the library it's in the list of live

1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:25.560
 because I was like whoa this is cool I didn't know this existed

1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:27.560
 and I tried to find it

1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:29.560
 but I would show it to you

1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:31.560
 and feed it back to our product teams

1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:33.560
 there you go

1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:35.560
 so yeah sorry

1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:37.560
 just to mention

1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:39.560
 the expectation there is

1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:41.560
 basically you're going to

1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:43.560
 discover new songs

1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:45.560
 so then you can be quite adventurous

1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:47.560
 in the recommendations you do

1:04:47.560 --> 1:04:49.560
 but we have

1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:51.560
 another product called Daily Mix

1:04:51.560 --> 1:04:53.560
 which kind of implies that these are only going to be your favorites

1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:55.560
 so if you have

1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:57.560
 9 out of 10 that is good

1:04:57.560 --> 1:04:59.560
 and 9 out of 10 that doesn't work for you

1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:01.560
 you're going to think it's a horrible product

1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:03.560
 so actually a lot of the product development

1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:05.560
 we learned over the years is about setting the right expectations

1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:07.560
 so for Daily Mix

1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:09.560
 you know algorithmically

1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:11.560
 we would pick among things that feel very safe

1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:13.560
 in your taste space

1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:15.560
 or discover weekly we go kind of wild

1:05:15.560 --> 1:05:17.560
 because the expectation is

1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:19.560
 most of this is not going to

1:05:19.560 --> 1:05:21.560
 so a lot of that a lot of to answer your question there

1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:23.560
 a lot of

1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:25.560
 we have some products where the whole point is

1:05:25.560 --> 1:05:27.560
 that the user can click play put the phone in the pocket

1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:29.560
 and it should be really good music for like an hour

1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:31.560
 we have other products where

1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:33.560
 you probably need to say like no

1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:35.560
 save, no, no

1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:37.560
 and it's very interactive

1:05:37.560 --> 1:05:39.560
 that makes sense and then the radio product

1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:41.560
 the stations product is one of these like click play

1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:43.560
 put in your pocket for hours

1:05:43.560 --> 1:05:45.560
 that's really interesting so you're thinking of

1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:47.560
 different test sets

1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:49.560
 for different users

1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:51.560
 and trying to create products that sort of

1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:53.560
 optimize

1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:55.560
 optimize for those test sets

1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:57.560
 that represents a specific set of

1:05:57.560 --> 1:05:59.560
 users yes I think

1:05:59.560 --> 1:06:01.560
 one thing that I think is interesting

1:06:01.560 --> 1:06:03.560
 is

1:06:03.560 --> 1:06:05.560
 we invested quite heavily in editorial

1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:07.560
 in people creating playlists

1:06:07.560 --> 1:06:09.560
 using statistical data

1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:11.560
 and that was successful for us and then we also

1:06:11.560 --> 1:06:13.560
 invested in machine learning

1:06:13.560 --> 1:06:15.560
 and for the longest time

1:06:15.560 --> 1:06:17.560
 within Spotify and within the rest of the

1:06:17.560 --> 1:06:19.560
 industry there was always this narrative of

1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:21.560
 humans versus the machine

1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:23.560
 algo versus editorial

1:06:23.560 --> 1:06:25.560
 and editors would say like well

1:06:25.560 --> 1:06:27.560
 if I had that data if I could see your

1:06:27.560 --> 1:06:29.560
 playlisting history and I made a choice

1:06:29.560 --> 1:06:31.560
 for you I would have made a better choice

1:06:31.560 --> 1:06:33.560
 and they would have because they're

1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:35.560
 much smarter than these algorithms

1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:37.560
 human is incredibly smart compared to our

1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:39.560
 algorithms they can take

1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:41.560
 culture into account and so forth

1:06:41.560 --> 1:06:43.560
 the problem is that they can't make 200 million

1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:45.560
 decisions

1:06:45.560 --> 1:06:47.560
 per hour for every user that logs

1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:49.560
 in so the algo may be

1:06:49.560 --> 1:06:51.560
 not as sophisticated but much more efficient

1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:53.560
 so there was this contradiction

1:06:53.560 --> 1:06:55.560
 but then a few years ago

1:06:55.560 --> 1:06:57.560
 we started

1:06:57.560 --> 1:06:59.560
 focusing on this kind of human in the loop

1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:01.560
 thinking around machine learning

1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:03.560
 and we actually coined an internal

1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:05.560
 term for it called algotorial

1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:07.560
 the combination of algorithms and editors

1:07:07.560 --> 1:07:09.560
 where if we take a concrete

1:07:09.560 --> 1:07:11.560
 example you think

1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:13.560
 of the editor this

1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:15.560
 paid expert that we have

1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:17.560
 there's really good at something like

1:07:17.560 --> 1:07:19.560
 soul, hip hop

1:07:19.560 --> 1:07:21.560
 EDM something right there are two experts

1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:23.560
 no one in the industry

1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:25.560
 so they have all the cultural knowledge

1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:27.560
 you think of them as the product manager

1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:29.560
 and you say that

1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:31.560
 let's say that you want to create

1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:33.560
 you think that there's a product

1:07:33.560 --> 1:07:35.560
 need in the world for something like songs to sing

1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:37.560
 in the car or songs to sing in the shower

1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:39.560
 I'm taking that example because it exists

1:07:39.560 --> 1:07:41.560
 people love to scream songs in the car

1:07:41.560 --> 1:07:43.560
 when they drive right

1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:45.560
 so you want to create that product and you have this product manager

1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:47.560
 who's a musical expert

1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:49.560
 they create, they come up with a concept

1:07:49.560 --> 1:07:51.560
 like I think this is a missing thing in humanity

1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:53.560
 like a playlist called songs to sing in the car

1:07:53.560 --> 1:07:55.560
 they create

1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:57.560
 the framing, the image

1:07:57.560 --> 1:07:59.560
 the title and they create a test set

1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:01.560
 they create a group of songs

1:08:01.560 --> 1:08:03.560
 like a few thousand songs out of the catalog

1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:05.560
 that they manually curate

1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:07.560
 that are known songs that are great to sing in the car

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:09.560
 and they can take like

1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:11.560
 through romance into account they understand things

1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:13.560
 that algorithms do not at all

1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:15.560
 so they have this huge set of tracks

1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:17.560
 then when we deliver that to you

1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:19.560
 we look at your taste vectors

1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:21.560
 and you get the 20 tracks that are songs to sing in the car

1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:23.560
 in your taste

1:08:23.560 --> 1:08:25.560
 so you have personalization

1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:27.560
 and editorial input

1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:29.560
 in the same process

1:08:29.560 --> 1:08:31.560
 if that makes sense

1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:33.560
 it makes total sense and I have several questions around that

1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:35.560
 this is like

1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:37.560
 fascinating

1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:39.560
 so first it is a little bit surprising

1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:41.560
 to me

1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:43.560
 that the world expert

1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:45.560
 humans are outperforming

1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:47.560
 machines

1:08:47.560 --> 1:08:49.560
 at specifying

1:08:49.560 --> 1:08:51.560
 songs to sing in the car

1:08:51.560 --> 1:08:53.560
 so

1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:55.560
 maybe you could talk to that a little bit

1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:57.560
 I don't know if you can put it into words but

1:08:57.560 --> 1:08:59.560
 what is it

1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:01.560
 how difficult is this problem

1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:03.560
 of

1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:05.560
 I guess what I'm trying to ask

1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:07.560
 is there how difficult is it to encode

1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:09.560
 the cultural references

1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:11.560
 the context

1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:13.560
 of the song, the artists

1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:15.560
 all those things together

1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:17.560
 can machine learning really not do that

1:09:17.560 --> 1:09:19.560
 I mean I think machine learning is great

1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:21.560
 at replicating patterns

1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:23.560
 if you have the patterns

1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:25.560
 but if you try to write

1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:27.560
 a spec of what song is great

1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:29.560
 to sing in the car definition is

1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:31.560
 is it loud

1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:33.560
 does it have many choruses to have been in movies

1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:35.560
 it quickly gets incredibly complicated

1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:37.560
 right

1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:39.560
 and a lot of it may not be

1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:41.560
 in the structure of the song or the title

1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:43.560
 it could be cultural references because

1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:45.560
 it was a hasty one

1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:47.560
 so the definition problems

1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:49.560
 quickly get

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:51.560
 and I think that was the insight of Andrew Eng

1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:53.560
 when he said that job of the product manager

1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:55.560
 is to understand these things that

1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:57.560
 algorithms don't and then

1:09:57.560 --> 1:09:59.560
 define what that looks like

1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:01.560
 and then you have something to train towards

1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:03.560
 then you have kind of the test set

1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:05.560
 but today the editors create this

1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:07.560
 pool of tracks and then we personalize

1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:09.560
 you could easily imagine that once you have this set

1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:11.560
 you could have some automatic exploration

1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:13.560
 of the rest of the catalog because then you understand

1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:15.560
 what it is

1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:17.560
 and then the other side of it when machine learning

1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:19.560
 does help is this taste

1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:21.560
 vector

1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:23.560
 how hard is it to construct

1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:25.560
 a vector that represents the things

1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:27.560
 an individual human likes

1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:29.560
 this human preference

1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:31.560
 so you can

1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:33.560
 you know music isn't like

1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:35.560
 it's not like Amazon

1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:37.560
 like things you usually buy

1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:39.560
 music seems more amorphous

1:10:39.560 --> 1:10:41.560
 like it's this thing

1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:43.560
 that's hard to specify like

1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:45.560
 what is

1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:47.560
 if you look at my playlist what is the music

1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:49.560
 that I love it's harder

1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:51.560
 it seems to be

1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:53.560
 much more difficult to specify concretely

1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:55.560
 so how hard is it

1:10:55.560 --> 1:10:57.560
 to build a taste vector

1:10:57.560 --> 1:10:59.560
 it is very hard in the sense that you need a lot of

1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:01.560
 data

1:11:01.560 --> 1:11:03.560
 and I think what we found was that

1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:05.560
 so it's not a stationary problem

1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:07.560
 it changes over time

1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:09.560
 and so

1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:11.560
 we've gone

1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:13.560
 through the journey of if

1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:15.560
 you've done a lot of computer vision

1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:17.560
 obviously I've done a bunch of computer vision

1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:19.560
 in my past and we started

1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:21.560
 kind of with the handcrafted heuristics

1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:23.560
 for you know

1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:25.560
 this is kind of in the music this is this

1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:27.560
 and if you consume this you probably like this

1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:29.560
 so we have

1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:31.560
 we started there and we have some of that still

1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:33.560
 then what was interesting about the playlist data

1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:35.560
 was that you could find these latent things that

1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:37.560
 wouldn't necessarily even make sense to you

1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:39.560
 that could

1:11:39.560 --> 1:11:41.560
 could even capture maybe cultural references

1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:43.560
 because they co occurred things that

1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:45.560
 that wouldn't have appeared

1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:47.560
 kind of mechanistically either in the content

1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:49.560
 or so forth so

1:11:49.560 --> 1:11:51.560
 um

1:11:51.560 --> 1:11:53.560
 I think that

1:11:53.560 --> 1:11:55.560
 um

1:11:55.560 --> 1:11:57.560
 I think the core assumption

1:11:57.560 --> 1:11:59.560
 is that

1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:01.560
 there are patterns

1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:03.560
 in almost everything

1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:05.560
 and if there are patterns

1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:07.560
 these embedding techniques are getting better and better

1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:09.560
 now as everyone else

1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:11.560
 we're also using

1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:13.560
 kind of deep embeddings where you can encode binary

1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:15.560
 values and so forth

1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:17.560
 and what I think

1:12:17.560 --> 1:12:19.560
 is interesting is this process

1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:21.560
 to try to find things that

1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:23.560
 um

1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:25.560
 necessarily you wouldn't actually have

1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:27.560
 guest so it is very

1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:29.560
 hard in an engineering

1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:31.560
 sense to find the right dimensions

1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:33.560
 it's an incredible scalability

1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:35.560
 problem to do for hundreds of millions

1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:37.560
 of users and to update it every day

1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:39.560
 but in

1:12:39.560 --> 1:12:41.560
 theory

1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:43.560
 in theory embeddings isn't that

1:12:43.560 --> 1:12:45.560
 complicated the fact

1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:47.560
 that you try to find some principle components

1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:49.560
 or something like that dimensionality reduction

1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:51.560
 and so forth so the theory I guess is easy

1:12:51.560 --> 1:12:53.560
 because it's very very hard

1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:55.560
 and it's a huge

1:12:55.560 --> 1:12:57.560
 engineering challenge but fortunately we have

1:12:57.560 --> 1:12:59.560
 some amazing both research and

1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:01.560
 engineering teams in this space

1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:03.560
 yeah I guess the

1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:05.560
 question is all

1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:07.560
 I mean it's similar I deal with the autonomous

1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:09.560
 vehicle space is the question is

1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:11.560
 how hard is driving

1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:13.560
 and here is

1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:15.560
 basically the question is of

1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:17.560
 edge cases

1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:19.560
 so embedding

1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:21.560
 probably works

1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:23.560
 not probably but

1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:25.560
 I would imagine works well

1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:27.560
 in a lot of cases

1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:29.560
 so there's a bunch of questions that arise then

1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:31.560
 so do song

1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:33.560
 preferences does your taste vector

1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:35.560
 depend on context

1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:37.560
 like mood

1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:39.560
 right so there's

1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:41.560
 different moods and

1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:43.560
 absolutely so how does that

1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:45.560
 take in

1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:47.560
 is it is it possible to take that

1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:49.560
 consideration or do you just leave

1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:51.560
 that as a interface

1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:53.560
 problem that allows the user to just control

1:13:53.560 --> 1:13:55.560
 it so when I'm looking for a work

1:13:55.560 --> 1:13:57.560
 out music I kind of specify it

1:13:57.560 --> 1:13:59.560
 by choosing certain playlists

1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:01.560
 doing certain search yeah

1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:03.560
 so that's a great point and back to the product

1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:05.560
 development you could try

1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:07.560
 to spend a few years trying to predict

1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:09.560
 which mood you're in automatically when you open

1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:11.560
 Spotify or you create a tab

1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:13.560
 which is happy and sad right and you're going to be

1:14:13.560 --> 1:14:15.560
 right 100% of the time with one click

1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:17.560
 now probably much better to let

1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:19.560
 the user tell you if they're happy or sad

1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:21.560
 or if they want to work out on the other hand

1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:23.560
 if your user interface become 2000

1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:25.560
 tabs you're introducing so much friction

1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:27.560
 so no one will use the product so then you have to

1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:29.560
 get better so it's this

1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:31.560
 thing where I think it maybe was

1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:33.560
 I remember who coined it but it's

1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:35.560
 called full tolerant UIs right to build a UI

1:14:35.560 --> 1:14:37.560
 that is tolerant to being wrong

1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:39.560
 and then you can be much

1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:41.560
 less right in your

1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:43.560
 in your algorithms so

1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:45.560
 we had to learn a lot of that

1:14:45.560 --> 1:14:47.560
 building the right UI that fits

1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:49.560
 where the machine learning is

1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:51.560
 and a great

1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:53.560
 discovery there which was

1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:55.560
 by the teams during

1:14:55.560 --> 1:14:57.560
 one of our hack days was this

1:14:57.560 --> 1:14:59.560
 thing of taking discovery packaging

1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:01.560
 into a playlist and saying that

1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:03.560
 these are new tracks

1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:05.560
 that we think you might like

1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:07.560
 based on this and setting the right expectation

1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:09.560
 made it a great product

1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:11.560
 so I think we have this benefit that for example

1:15:11.560 --> 1:15:13.560
 Tesla doesn't have

1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:15.560
 that we can

1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:17.560
 we can change the expectation we can build

1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:19.560
 a full tolerant setting it's very hard to be

1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:21.560
 full tolerant when you're driving at

1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:23.560
 100 miles per hour or something

1:15:23.560 --> 1:15:25.560
 and we have the luxury of

1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:27.560
 being able to say that

1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:29.560
 of being wrong if we have the right

1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:31.560
 UI which gives us

1:15:31.560 --> 1:15:33.560
 different abilities to take more risk

1:15:33.560 --> 1:15:35.560
 so I actually think the self driving

1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:37.560
 problem is much harder

1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:39.560
 oh yeah for sure

1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:41.560
 it's much less fun

1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:43.560
 because

1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:45.560
 people die exactly

1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:47.560
 and in Spotify

1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:49.560
 it's

1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:51.560
 such a more fun problem because

1:15:51.560 --> 1:15:53.560
 failure will

1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:55.560
 I mean failure is beautiful in a way

1:15:55.560 --> 1:15:57.560
 at least exploration so it's a really fun

1:15:57.560 --> 1:15:59.560
 reinforcement learning problem and the worst

1:15:59.560 --> 1:16:01.560
 case scenario is you get these WTF tweets

1:16:01.560 --> 1:16:03.560
 like how did I get this

1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:05.560
 which is a lot better than the self

1:16:05.560 --> 1:16:07.560
 driving failure

1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:09.560
 so

1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:11.560
 what's the feedback that a user

1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:13.560
 what's the signal

1:16:13.560 --> 1:16:15.560
 that a user provides

1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:17.560
 into the system so

1:16:17.560 --> 1:16:19.560
 you mentioned skipping

1:16:19.560 --> 1:16:21.560
 what is like the strongest signal

1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:23.560
 you didn't mention clicking

1:16:23.560 --> 1:16:25.560
 like

1:16:25.560 --> 1:16:27.560
 so we have a few signals that are important

1:16:27.560 --> 1:16:29.560
 obviously playing

1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:31.560
 playing through

1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:33.560
 so one of the benefits of music actually

1:16:33.560 --> 1:16:35.560
 even compared to podcasts or

1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:37.560
 movies is the object itself

1:16:37.560 --> 1:16:39.560
 is really only about three minutes

1:16:39.560 --> 1:16:41.560
 so you get a lot of chances to recommend

1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:43.560
 and the feedback loop is

1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:45.560
 every three minutes instead of every two hours

1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:47.560
 or something so you actually get

1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:49.560
 kind of noisy but

1:16:49.560 --> 1:16:51.560
 quite fast feedback and so you can see

1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:53.560
 if people played through or if the

1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:55.560
 which is the inverse of skip really

1:16:55.560 --> 1:16:57.560
 that's an important signal on the other hand

1:16:57.560 --> 1:16:59.560
 much of the consumption happens

1:16:59.560 --> 1:17:01.560
 when your phone is in your pocket maybe you're running

1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:03.560
 or driving or you're playing on a speaker

1:17:03.560 --> 1:17:05.560
 and you're not skipping doesn't mean that you love that song

1:17:05.560 --> 1:17:07.560
 it might be that it wasn't bad enough

1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:09.560
 that you would walk up and skip

1:17:09.560 --> 1:17:11.560
 so it's a noisy signal

1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:13.560
 then we have the equivalent of the like

1:17:13.560 --> 1:17:15.560
 which is you save it to your library

1:17:15.560 --> 1:17:17.560
 that's a pretty strong signal of affection

1:17:17.560 --> 1:17:19.560
 and then

1:17:19.560 --> 1:17:21.560
 we have the more explicit signal

1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:23.560
 of play listing like you took the time

1:17:23.560 --> 1:17:25.560
 to create a playlist you put it in there

1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:27.560
 there's a very little small chance that

1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:29.560
 if you took all that trouble this is not

1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:31.560
 a really important track to you

1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:33.560
 but also

1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:35.560
 what are the tracks it relates to so we have

1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:37.560
 we have the play listing we have the like and then we have

1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:39.560
 the listening or skip

1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:41.560
 and you have to

1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:43.560
 have very different approaches to all of them because

1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:45.560
 at different levels of noise

1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:47.560
 one is very voluminous but noisy

1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:49.560
 and the other is rare but

1:17:49.560 --> 1:17:51.560
 you can probably trust it

1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:53.560
 yeah it's interesting because

1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:55.560
 I think between those signals captures

1:17:55.560 --> 1:17:57.560
 all the information you'd want to capture

1:17:57.560 --> 1:17:59.560
 I mean there's a feeling

1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:01.560
 for me that there's sometimes that I'll

1:18:01.560 --> 1:18:03.560
 hear a song that's like yes this is

1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:05.560
 you know this was the right song for the moment

1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:07.560
 but there's really no way to express

1:18:07.560 --> 1:18:09.560
 that fact except by

1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:11.560
 listening through it all the way

1:18:11.560 --> 1:18:13.560
 and maybe playing it again at that time

1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:15.560
 or something but there's

1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:17.560
 no need for a button that says

1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:19.560
 this was the best song could have

1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:21.560
 heard at this moment well we're playing around

1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:23.560
 with that with kind of the thumbs up

1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:25.560
 concept saying like I really like this

1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:27.560
 just kind of talking to the algorithm

1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:29.560
 it's unclear if that's the best way

1:18:29.560 --> 1:18:31.560
 for humans to interact maybe it is

1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:33.560
 maybe they should think of Spotify

1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:35.560
 as a person an agent sitting there

1:18:35.560 --> 1:18:37.560
 trying to serve you and you can say like

1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:39.560
 that's Spotify, good Spotify

1:18:39.560 --> 1:18:41.560
 right now the analogy we've had is more

1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:43.560
 you shouldn't think of us

1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:45.560
 we should be investable and the feedback

1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:47.560
 is if you save it

1:18:47.560 --> 1:18:49.560
 you work for yourself you do a playlist

1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:51.560
 because you think is great and we can learn from that

1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:53.560
 it's kind of back to Tesla

1:18:53.560 --> 1:18:55.560
 how they kind of have this shadow mode

1:18:55.560 --> 1:18:57.560
 we sit in what you drive

1:18:57.560 --> 1:18:59.560
 we kind of took the same analogy

1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:01.560
 we sit in what you playlist

1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:03.560
 and then maybe we can offer you an autopilot

1:19:03.560 --> 1:19:05.560
 we can take over for a while or something like that

1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:07.560
 and then back off if you say like

1:19:07.560 --> 1:19:09.560
 that's not good enough

1:19:09.560 --> 1:19:11.560
 but I think it's interesting to figure out

1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:13.560
 what your mental model is

1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:15.560
 if Spotify is an AI that you talk to

1:19:15.560 --> 1:19:17.560
 which I think might be a bit too abstract

1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:19.560
 for many consumers

1:19:19.560 --> 1:19:21.560
 or if you still think of it as

1:19:21.560 --> 1:19:23.560
 it's my music app

1:19:23.560 --> 1:19:25.560
 it's more helpful

1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:27.560
 and depends on the device it's running on

1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:29.560
 which brings us to

1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:31.560
 smart speakers

1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:33.560
 so I have a lot of the Spotify listening I do

1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:35.560
 is on

1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:37.560
 things on devices I can talk to

1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:39.560
 whether it's from Amazon, Google

1:19:39.560 --> 1:19:41.560
 or Apple

1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:43.560
 what's the role of Spotify in those devices

1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:45.560
 how do you think of it differently than

1:19:45.560 --> 1:19:47.560
 on the phone or on the desktop

1:19:47.560 --> 1:19:49.560
 there are a few things

1:19:49.560 --> 1:19:51.560
 to say about the first of all

1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:53.560
 it's incredibly exciting they're growing like crazy

1:19:53.560 --> 1:19:55.560
 especially here in the US

1:19:59.560 --> 1:20:01.560
 and it's solving

1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:03.560
 a consumer need that I think is

1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:07.560
 you can think of it as

1:20:07.560 --> 1:20:09.560
 just remote interactivity

1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:11.560
 you can control this thing from

1:20:11.560 --> 1:20:13.560
 across the room and it may

1:20:13.560 --> 1:20:15.560
 feel like a small thing but it turns out

1:20:15.560 --> 1:20:17.560
 that friction matters to consumers

1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:19.560
 being able to say play, pause

1:20:19.560 --> 1:20:21.560
 and so forth from across the room

1:20:21.560 --> 1:20:23.560
 is very powerful so basically

1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:25.560
 you made the living room interactive

1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:27.560
 now

1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:29.560
 and

1:20:29.560 --> 1:20:31.560
 what we see in our data is that

1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:33.560
 the number one use case for these speakers

1:20:33.560 --> 1:20:35.560
 is music, music and podcast

1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:37.560
 so

1:20:37.560 --> 1:20:39.560
 fortunately for us it's been important

1:20:39.560 --> 1:20:41.560
 to these companies to have those use case

1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:43.560
 covered so they want to Spotify on this

1:20:43.560 --> 1:20:45.560
 we have very good relationships with

1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:47.560
 them

1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:49.560
 and we're seeing tremendous

1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:51.560
 success with them

1:20:51.560 --> 1:20:53.560
 what I think is interesting

1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:55.560
 about them is

1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:57.560
 it's already working

1:20:57.560 --> 1:20:59.560
 we kind of had this

1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:01.560
 epiphany

1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:03.560
 many years ago back when we started

1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:05.560
 using Sonos if you went through all the

1:21:05.560 --> 1:21:07.560
 trouble of setting up your Sonos system

1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:09.560
 you had this magical experience where you had

1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:11.560
 all the music ever made in your living room

1:21:11.560 --> 1:21:13.560
 and we

1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:15.560
 made this assumption that

1:21:15.560 --> 1:21:17.560
 at home everyone used to have a CD player at home

1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:19.560
 but they never managed to get their files

1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:21.560
 working in the home having this network attached

1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:23.560
 storage was too cumbersome for most consumers

1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:25.560
 so we made the assumption that

1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:27.560
 the home would skip from the CD all the way to

1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:29.560
 streaming box

1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:31.560
 where you would buy the steering wheel without

1:21:31.560 --> 1:21:33.560
 all the music built in that took longer than we

1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:35.560
 thought but with the voice speakers that was the

1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:37.560
 unlocking that made kind of the connected speaker

1:21:37.560 --> 1:21:39.560
 happen in the home

1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:41.560
 so it really

1:21:41.560 --> 1:21:43.560
 it really exploded and

1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:45.560
 we saw this engagement that we

1:21:45.560 --> 1:21:47.560
 predicted would happen

1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:49.560
 what I think is interesting though is where it's going

1:21:49.560 --> 1:21:51.560
 from now

1:21:51.560 --> 1:21:53.560
 right now you think of them as voice speakers

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:55.560
 but I think if you look at

1:21:55.560 --> 1:21:57.560
 Google I.O. for example

1:21:57.560 --> 1:21:59.560
 they just added a camera

1:21:59.560 --> 1:22:01.560
 to it where when the alarm goes off

1:22:01.560 --> 1:22:03.560
 instead of saying

1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:05.560
 hey Google stop you can just

1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:07.560
 wave your hand

1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:09.560
 so I think they're going to think more of it as

1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:11.560
 an agent

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:13.560
 as an assistant truly an assistant

1:22:13.560 --> 1:22:15.560
 and an assistant that can see you

1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:17.560
 is going to be much more effective than a blind

1:22:17.560 --> 1:22:19.560
 assistant so I think these things will

1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:21.560
 morph and we won't necessarily think of them as

1:22:21.560 --> 1:22:23.560
 quote unquote voice speakers anymore

1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:25.560
 just as

1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:27.560
 interactive

1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:29.560
 access to the internet in the home

1:22:29.560 --> 1:22:31.560
 but I still think that

1:22:31.560 --> 1:22:33.560
 the biggest use case for those will be

1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:35.560
 will be audio so

1:22:35.560 --> 1:22:37.560
 for that reason we're investing heavily in it

1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:39.560
 and we built our own NLU stack

1:22:39.560 --> 1:22:41.560
 to be able to

1:22:41.560 --> 1:22:43.560
 the challenge here is

1:22:43.560 --> 1:22:45.560
 how do you innovate in that world

1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:47.560
 it lowers friction for consumers

1:22:47.560 --> 1:22:49.560
 but it's also much more constrained

1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:51.560
 you have no pixels to play with

1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:53.560
 in an audio only world

1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:55.560
 it's really the vocabulary that is the interface

1:22:55.560 --> 1:22:57.560
 so we started investing

1:22:57.560 --> 1:22:59.560
 and playing around quite a lot with that

1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:01.560
 trying to understand what the future will be

1:23:01.560 --> 1:23:03.560
 of you speaking and gesturing

1:23:03.560 --> 1:23:05.560
 and waving at your music

1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:07.560
 and actually you're actually nudging closer

1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:09.560
 to autonomous vehicle space

1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:11.560
 because from everything I've seen

1:23:11.560 --> 1:23:13.560
 the level of frustration people experience

1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:15.560
 upon failure of natural language

1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:17.560
 understanding is much higher

1:23:17.560 --> 1:23:19.560
 than failure in other context

1:23:19.560 --> 1:23:21.560
 people get frustrated really fast

1:23:21.560 --> 1:23:23.560
 so if you screw that

1:23:23.560 --> 1:23:25.560
 experience up even just a little bit

1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:27.560
 they give up really quickly

1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:29.560
 and I think you see that in the data

1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:31.560
 while it's tremendously successful

1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:33.560
 the most common interactions

1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:35.560
 are play, pause

1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:37.560
 and you know next

1:23:37.560 --> 1:23:39.560
 the things where if you compare it to taking up your phone

1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:41.560
 unlocking it, bringing up the app and skipping

1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:43.560
 clicking skip

1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:45.560
 it was much lower friction

1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:47.560
 but then

1:23:47.560 --> 1:23:49.560
 for longer more complicated things

1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:51.560
 can you find me that song about people still bring up their phone

1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:53.560
 and search and then play it on their speaker

1:23:53.560 --> 1:23:55.560
 so we tried again to build a fault tolerant UI

1:23:55.560 --> 1:23:57.560
 where for the more

1:23:57.560 --> 1:23:59.560
 complicated things you can still pick up your phone

1:23:59.560 --> 1:24:01.560
 have powerful full keyboard search

1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:03.560
 and then try to optimize

1:24:03.560 --> 1:24:05.560
 for where there is actually lower friction

1:24:05.560 --> 1:24:07.560
 and try to, it's kind of like the

1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:09.560
 test autopilot thing

1:24:09.560 --> 1:24:11.560
 you have to be at the level where

1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:13.560
 you're helpful if you're too smart

1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:15.560
 and just in the way people are going to get frustrated

1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:17.560
 and first of all

1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:19.560
 I'm not obsessed with where it happens

1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:21.560
 it's just a good song but let me mention that as a use case

1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:23.560
 because it's an interesting one

1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:25.560
 I've literally told

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:27.560
 I don't want to say the name of the speaker

1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:29.560
 because when people are listening to it

1:24:29.560 --> 1:24:31.560
 it'll make their speaker go off

1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:33.560
 but I talk to the speaker

1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:35.560
 and I say play

1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:37.560
 Stairway to Heaven

1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:39.560
 and every time

1:24:39.560 --> 1:24:41.560
 but a large percentage of the time plays the wrong

1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:43.560
 Stairway to Heaven

1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:45.560
 it plays some cover of the

1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:47.560
 and

1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:49.560
 that part of the experience

1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:51.560
 I actually wonder from a business perspective

1:24:51.560 --> 1:24:53.560
 the Spotify control

1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:55.560
 that entire experience

1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:57.560
 or no

1:24:57.560 --> 1:24:59.560
 it seems like the NLU

1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:01.560
 stuff is controlled by the speaker

1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:03.560
 and then Spotify stays

1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:05.560
 at a layer below that

1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:07.560
 it's a good and complicated question

1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:09.560
 some of which is dependent

1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:11.560
 on the

1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:13.560
 partners so it's hard to comment on the specifics

1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:15.560
 but

1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:17.560
 the question is the right one

1:25:17.560 --> 1:25:19.560
 the challenge is

1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:21.560
 if you can't use any of the personalization

1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:23.560
 we know which Stairway to Heaven

1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:25.560
 and the truth is maybe for one person

1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:27.560
 it is exactly the cover that they want

1:25:27.560 --> 1:25:29.560
 to be very frustrated

1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:31.560
 I think

1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:33.560
 we default to the right version

1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:35.560
 but you actually want to be able to do the cover

1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:37.560
 for the person that just played the cover 50 times

1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:39.560
 or Spotify is just going to seem stupid

1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:41.560
 so you want to be able to leverage the personalization

1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:43.560
 but you have this stack

1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:45.560
 where you have the

1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:47.560
 the ASR and this thing called the end best list

1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:49.560
 or the end best guesses

1:25:49.560 --> 1:25:51.560
 here and then the personalization comes in at the end

1:25:51.560 --> 1:25:53.560
 you actually want the personalization to be here

1:25:53.560 --> 1:25:55.560
 when you're guessing about what they actually meant

1:25:55.560 --> 1:25:57.560
 we're working with these partners

1:25:57.560 --> 1:25:59.560
 and it's a complicated

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:01.560
 it's a complicated thing

1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:03.560
 where you want to

1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:05.560
 so first of all you want to be very

1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:07.560
 careful with your users data

1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:09.560
 you don't want to share your users data without the permission

1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:11.560
 but you want to share some data so that their experience gets better

1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:13.560
 so that these partners

1:26:13.560 --> 1:26:15.560
 can understand enough but not too much and so forth

1:26:15.560 --> 1:26:17.560
 so

1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:19.560
 it's really the trick is that

1:26:19.560 --> 1:26:21.560
 it's like a business driven relationship

1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:23.560
 where you're doing product development across companies

1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:25.560
 together

1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:27.560
 which is really complicated

1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:29.560
 but this is exactly why we built our own NLU

1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:31.560
 so that we actually

1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:33.560
 can make personalized guesses

1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:35.560
 because this is the biggest frustration

1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:37.560
 from a user point of view they don't understand

1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:39.560
 about ASRs and end best lists

1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:41.560
 and business deals they're like how hard can it be

1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:43.560
 I've told this thing 50 times

1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:45.560
 this version and still it plays the wrong thing

1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:47.560
 it can't be hard

1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:49.560
 so we try to take that user approach

1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:51.560
 if the user is not going to understand

1:26:51.560 --> 1:26:53.560
 the implications of business we have to

1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:55.560
 solve it

1:26:55.560 --> 1:26:57.560
 let's talk about sort of a complicated subject

1:26:57.560 --> 1:26:59.560
 that I myself

1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:01.560
 I'm quite

1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:03.560
 torn about

1:27:03.560 --> 1:27:05.560
 the idea sort of of

1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:07.560
 paying

1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:09.560
 artists

1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:11.560
 I saw as of August 31

1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:13.560
 2018

1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:15.560
 over 11 billion dollars

1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:17.560
 were paid to rights holders

1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:19.560
 and further distributed

1:27:19.560 --> 1:27:21.560
 to artists from Spotify

1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:23.560
 so a lot of money is being paid to artists

1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:25.560
 first of all

1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:27.560
 the whole time as a consumer for me

1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:29.560
 when I look at Spotify

1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:31.560
 I'm not sure I'm remembering

1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:33.560
 correctly but I think you said exactly how I feel

1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:35.560
 which is this is too good to be true

1:27:35.560 --> 1:27:37.560
 like

1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:39.560
 when I started using Spotify

1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:41.560
 I assumed you guys would go bankrupt

1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:43.560
 in like a month

1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:45.560
 it's like this is too good

1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:47.560
 a lot of people did

1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:49.560
 this is amazing

1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:51.560
 so one question I have

1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:53.560
 is sort of the bigger question

1:27:53.560 --> 1:27:55.560
 how do you make money in this complicated world

1:27:55.560 --> 1:27:57.560
 how do you deal with the relationship

1:27:57.560 --> 1:27:59.560
 with record labels

1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:01.560
 who

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:03.560
 are

1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:05.560
 complicated

1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:07.560
 these big

1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:09.560
 you essentially have the task

1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:11.560
 of hurting

1:28:11.560 --> 1:28:13.560
 cats but like rich

1:28:13.560 --> 1:28:15.560
 and powerful cats

1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:17.560
 and also

1:28:17.560 --> 1:28:19.560
 have the task of paying artists enough

1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:21.560
 and paying those labels enough

1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:23.560
 and still making money in the internet

1:28:23.560 --> 1:28:25.560
 space where people are not willing to pay

1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:27.560
 hundreds of dollars a month

1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:29.560
 so

1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:31.560
 how do you navigate the space

1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:33.560
 that's a beautiful description, hurting rich cats

1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:35.560
 I've never heard that before

1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:37.560
 it is

1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:39.560
 very complicated and I think

1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:41.560
 certainly

1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:43.560
 actually betting against Spotify has been statistically

1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:45.560
 a very smart thing to do

1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:47.560
 just looking at the

1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:49.560
 line of roadkill in music streaming services

1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:53.560
 it's kind of

1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:55.560
 I think if I understood the complexity

1:28:55.560 --> 1:28:57.560
 when I joined Spotify

1:28:57.560 --> 1:28:59.560
 fortunately I didn't know enough

1:28:59.560 --> 1:29:01.560
 about

1:29:01.560 --> 1:29:03.560
 the music industry to understand the complexities

1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:05.560
 because then I would have made a more rational guess

1:29:05.560 --> 1:29:07.560
 that it wouldn't work

1:29:07.560 --> 1:29:09.560
 so ignorance is bliss

1:29:09.560 --> 1:29:11.560
 but I think

1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:13.560
 there have been a few distinct challenges

1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:15.560
 I think as I said

1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:17.560
 one of the things that made it work at all

1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:19.560
 was that Sweden and the Nordics

1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:21.560
 was a lost market

1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:23.560
 so there was

1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:25.560
 no risk for labels to try this

1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:27.560
 I don't think it would have worked

1:29:27.560 --> 1:29:29.560
 if the market was

1:29:29.560 --> 1:29:31.560
 healthy

1:29:31.560 --> 1:29:33.560
 so that was the initial condition

1:29:33.560 --> 1:29:35.560
 then we had this tremendous

1:29:35.560 --> 1:29:37.560
 challenge with the model itself

1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:39.560
 so now

1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:41.560
 we're pirating but for the people who bought

1:29:41.560 --> 1:29:43.560
 a download or a CD

1:29:43.560 --> 1:29:45.560
 the artist would get

1:29:45.560 --> 1:29:47.560
 all the revenue for all the future plays

1:29:47.560 --> 1:29:49.560
 then right so you got it all up front

1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:51.560
 whereas the streaming model was like

1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:53.560
 almost nothing they won almost nothing they too

1:29:53.560 --> 1:29:55.560
 and then at some point this curve

1:29:55.560 --> 1:29:57.560
 of incremental revenue

1:29:57.560 --> 1:29:59.560
 would intersect with your day one payment

1:29:59.560 --> 1:30:01.560
 and that took a long time to play out

1:30:01.560 --> 1:30:03.560
 before

1:30:03.560 --> 1:30:05.560
 the music labels

1:30:05.560 --> 1:30:07.560
 they understood that but on the artist side

1:30:07.560 --> 1:30:09.560
 it took a lot of time to understand

1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:11.560
 that actually if I have a big hit that is going to be played

1:30:11.560 --> 1:30:13.560
 for many years this is a much better model

1:30:13.560 --> 1:30:15.560
 because I get paid based

1:30:15.560 --> 1:30:17.560
 on how much people use the product

1:30:17.560 --> 1:30:19.560
 not how much they thought they would use it day one

1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:21.560
 or so forth

1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:23.560
 so it was a complicated model to get across

1:30:23.560 --> 1:30:25.560
 but time helped with that

1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:27.560
 and now

1:30:27.560 --> 1:30:29.560
 the revenues to the music industry actually are bigger

1:30:29.560 --> 1:30:31.560
 again

1:30:31.560 --> 1:30:33.560
 it's gone through this incredible dip and now they're back up

1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:35.560
 and so we're very proud

1:30:35.560 --> 1:30:37.560
 of having been

1:30:37.560 --> 1:30:39.560
 a part of that

1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:41.560
 so there have been distinct problems

1:30:41.560 --> 1:30:43.560
 I think when it comes to the

1:30:43.560 --> 1:30:45.560
 labels

1:30:45.560 --> 1:30:47.560
 we have taken the painful approach

1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:49.560
 some of our competition at the time

1:30:49.560 --> 1:30:51.560
 they kind of

1:30:51.560 --> 1:30:53.560
 looked at other companies and said

1:30:53.560 --> 1:30:55.560
 if we just ignore the rights

1:30:55.560 --> 1:30:57.560
 we get really big really fast

1:30:57.560 --> 1:30:59.560
 we're going to be too big for the

1:30:59.560 --> 1:31:01.560
 labels to fail

1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:03.560
 they're not going to kill us

1:31:03.560 --> 1:31:05.560
 we're going to take that approach

1:31:05.560 --> 1:31:07.560
 we went legal from day one

1:31:07.560 --> 1:31:09.560
 and we negotiated

1:31:09.560 --> 1:31:11.560
 and negotiated and negotiated

1:31:11.560 --> 1:31:13.560
 it was very slow, very frustrating

1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:15.560
 we were angry at seeing other companies

1:31:15.560 --> 1:31:17.560
 taking shortcuts and seeming to get away with it

1:31:17.560 --> 1:31:19.560
 it was this game theory thing

1:31:19.560 --> 1:31:21.560
 where over many rounds of playing the game

1:31:21.560 --> 1:31:23.560
 this would be the right strategy

1:31:23.560 --> 1:31:25.560
 and even though

1:31:25.560 --> 1:31:27.560
 clearly there's a lot of frustrations

1:31:27.560 --> 1:31:29.560
 at times during renegotiations

1:31:29.560 --> 1:31:31.560
 there is this weird trust

1:31:31.560 --> 1:31:33.560
 honest and fair

1:31:33.560 --> 1:31:35.560
 we've never screwed them, they've never screwed us

1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:37.560
 it's ten years but

1:31:37.560 --> 1:31:39.560
 there's this trust in like

1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:41.560
 they know that if music doesn't get really big

1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:43.560
 if lots of people do not want to listen

1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:45.560
 to music and want to pay for it

1:31:45.560 --> 1:31:47.560
 Spotify has no business model

1:31:47.560 --> 1:31:49.560
 so we actually are incredibly aligned

1:31:49.560 --> 1:31:51.560
 right?

1:31:51.560 --> 1:31:53.560
 other companies have other business models

1:31:53.560 --> 1:31:55.560
 where even if they made new music

1:31:55.560 --> 1:31:57.560
 no money for music

1:31:57.560 --> 1:31:59.560
 they'd still be profitable companies

1:31:59.560 --> 1:32:01.560
 and I think the industry sees that

1:32:01.560 --> 1:32:03.560
 we are actually aligned

1:32:03.560 --> 1:32:05.560
 business wise

1:32:05.560 --> 1:32:07.560
 so there is this trust

1:32:07.560 --> 1:32:09.560
 that allows us to do

1:32:09.560 --> 1:32:11.560
 product development even if it's scary

1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:13.560
 you know

1:32:13.560 --> 1:32:15.560
 taking risks

1:32:15.560 --> 1:32:17.560
 the free model itself was an incredible risk

1:32:17.560 --> 1:32:19.560
 for the music industry to take

1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:21.560
 that they should get credit for

1:32:21.560 --> 1:32:23.560
 now some of it was that they had nothing to lose in Sweden

1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:25.560
 but frankly a lot of the labels also took risk

1:32:25.560 --> 1:32:27.560
 and so I think we built up that trust

1:32:27.560 --> 1:32:29.560
 with

1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:31.560
 I think hurting a cat sounds a bit

1:32:31.560 --> 1:32:33.560
 what's the word

1:32:33.560 --> 1:32:35.560
 it sounds like

1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:37.560
 dismissive? no every cat matter

1:32:37.560 --> 1:32:39.560
 they are all beautiful and very important

1:32:39.560 --> 1:32:41.560
 exactly they've taken a lot of risks

1:32:41.560 --> 1:32:43.560
 and certainly it's been frustrating on both sides

1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:47.560
 it's really like playing

1:32:47.560 --> 1:32:49.560
 it's game theory if you play the

1:32:49.560 --> 1:32:51.560
 if you play the game many times

1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:53.560
 then you can have the statistical outcome

1:32:53.560 --> 1:32:55.560
 that you bet on and it feels very painful

1:32:55.560 --> 1:32:57.560
 when you're in the middle of that

1:32:57.560 --> 1:32:59.560
 I mean there's risk there's trust

1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:01.560
 there's relationships from

1:33:01.560 --> 1:33:03.560
 just having read the biography

1:33:03.560 --> 1:33:05.560
 of Steve Jobs

1:33:05.560 --> 1:33:07.560
 similar kind of relationship were discussed

1:33:07.560 --> 1:33:09.560
 in iTunes the idea of selling

1:33:09.560 --> 1:33:11.560
 a song for a dollar was very uncomfortable

1:33:11.560 --> 1:33:13.560
 for labels and

1:33:13.560 --> 1:33:15.560
 and there was no

1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:17.560
 it was the same kind of thing it was trust

1:33:17.560 --> 1:33:19.560
 it was game theory

1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:21.560
 as a lot of relationships that had to be built

1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:23.560
 and it's really

1:33:23.560 --> 1:33:25.560
 terrifyingly difficult

1:33:25.560 --> 1:33:27.560
 process

1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:29.560
 that Apple could go through a little bit

1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:31.560
 because they could afford for that process

1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:33.560
 to fail

1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:35.560
 for Spotify it seems terrifying because

1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:37.560
 you can't

1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:39.560
 initially

1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:41.560
 I think a lot of it comes down to

1:33:41.560 --> 1:33:43.560
 honestly Daniel and his tenacity

1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:45.560
 in negotiating which seems like an impossible

1:33:45.560 --> 1:33:47.560
 discipline task

1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:49.560
 because

1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:51.560
 he was completely unknown and so forth

1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:53.560
 and also the reason that

1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:55.560
 it worked

1:33:55.560 --> 1:33:57.560
 but I think

1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:03.560
 I think game theory is probably the best way to think about it

1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:05.560
 you could straight go straight for this like Nash

1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:07.560
 equilibrium that someone is going to defect

1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:09.560
 or you play many times

1:34:09.560 --> 1:34:11.560
 and you try to actually go for the top left

1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:13.560
 the corporations sell

1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:15.560
 is there any magical

1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:17.560
 reason why Spotify

1:34:17.560 --> 1:34:19.560
 seems to have won

1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:21.560
 so a lot of people have tried to do

1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:23.560
 what Spotify tried to do

1:34:23.560 --> 1:34:25.560
 and Spotify has come out

1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:27.560
 well so the answer is that

1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:29.560
 there's no magical reason because I don't believe in magic

1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:31.560
 but I think there are

1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:33.560
 there are reasons

1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:35.560
 and I think some of them are that

1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:37.560
 people have

1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:39.560
 misunderstood

1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:41.560
 a lot of what we actually do

1:34:41.560 --> 1:34:43.560
 the actual

1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:45.560
 Spotify model is very complicated

1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:47.560
 they've looked at the premium model

1:34:47.560 --> 1:34:49.560
 like you can charge 9.99

1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:51.560
 for music and people are going to pay

1:34:51.560 --> 1:34:53.560
 but that's not what happened

1:34:53.560 --> 1:34:55.560
 actually when we launched the original mobile product

1:34:55.560 --> 1:34:57.560
 everyone said they would never pay

1:34:57.560 --> 1:34:59.560
 what happened was they started on the free product

1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:01.560
 and then their engagement

1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:03.560
 grew so much that eventually

1:35:03.560 --> 1:35:05.560
 they said maybe it is worth

1:35:05.560 --> 1:35:07.560
 9.99 right it's

1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:09.560
 your propensity to pay gross with your engagement

1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:11.560
 so we had this super complicated

1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:13.560
 business model where you operate

1:35:13.560 --> 1:35:15.560
 two different business model advertising and premium

1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:17.560
 products at the same time

1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:19.560
 and I think that is hard to replicate

1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:21.560
 I struggle to think of other companies

1:35:21.560 --> 1:35:23.560
 that run large scale advertising

1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:25.560
 and subscription products at the same time

1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:27.560
 so I think the business model is actually

1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:29.560
 much more complicated than people think it is

1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:31.560
 and so

1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:33.560
 some people went after just the premium part

1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:35.560
 without the free part and ran into a wall

1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:37.560
 where no one wanted to pay

1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:39.560
 some people went after just

1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:41.560
 music should be free just ads

1:35:41.560 --> 1:35:43.560
 which doesn't give you enough revenue

1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:45.560
 for the music industry

1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:47.560
 so I think that combination is

1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:49.560
 kind of opaque from the outside

1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:51.560
 so maybe I shouldn't say it here and reveal the secret

1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:53.560
 but that turns out to be hard

1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:55.560
 to replicate

1:35:55.560 --> 1:35:57.560
 than you would think

1:35:57.560 --> 1:35:59.560
 so there is a lot of brilliant business strategy here

1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:01.560
 brilliance or luck

1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:03.560
 probably more luck but it doesn't really matter

1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:05.560
 it looks brilliant in retrospect

1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:07.560
 so let's call it brilliant

1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:09.560
 yeah when the books are written it will be brilliant

1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:11.560
 you have

1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:13.560
 mentioned that your philosophy is to

1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:15.560
 embrace change

1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:17.560
 so how will the music streaming

1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:19.560
 and music listening

1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:21.560
 world change over the next

1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:23.560
 10 years, 20 years

1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:25.560
 you look out into the far future

1:36:25.560 --> 1:36:27.560
 what do you think?

1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:29.560
 I think that music

1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:31.560
 and for that matter audio

1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:33.560
 podcast audio books

1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:35.560
 I think it's one of the few

1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:37.560
 core human needs

1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:39.560
 I think there is no good reason to me

1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:41.560
 why it shouldn't be at the scale

1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:43.560
 of something like messaging or social networking

1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:45.560
 I don't think it's a niche thing

1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:47.560
 to listen to music or news or something

1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:49.560
 so I think scale is obviously one of the things

1:36:49.560 --> 1:36:51.560
 that I really hope for

1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:53.560
 I hope that it's going to be

1:36:53.560 --> 1:36:55.560
 billions of users, I hope eventually

1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:57.560
 everyone in the world gets access to

1:36:57.560 --> 1:36:59.560
 all the world's music ever made

1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:01.560
 so obviously I think it's going to be a much bigger business

1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:03.560
 otherwise we wouldn't be betting this big

1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:07.560
 now if you look more at how

1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:09.560
 it is consumed

1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:11.560
 what I'm hoping is back to this

1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:13.560
 analogy of the

1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:15.560
 software tool chain

1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:17.560
 where I think

1:37:17.560 --> 1:37:19.560
 sometimes internally

1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:21.560
 I make this analogy to

1:37:21.560 --> 1:37:23.560
 text messaging

1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:25.560
 text messaging was also based on

1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:27.560
 standards

1:37:27.560 --> 1:37:29.560
 in the area of mobile carriers

1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:31.560
 you had the SMS, the 140 character

1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:33.560
 120 carat SMS

1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:35.560
 and it was great

1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:37.560
 because everyone agreed on the standard

1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:39.560
 so as a consumer you got a lot of distributions

1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:41.560
 and interoperability but it was a very constrained format

1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:43.560
 and when the industry

1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:45.560
 wanted to add pictures to that format

1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:47.560
 to do the MMS, I looked it up

1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:49.560
 and I think it took from the late 80s to early 2000

1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:51.560
 this is like a 15, 20 year product cycle

1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:53.560
 to bring pictures into that

1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:55.560
 now once that entire

1:37:55.560 --> 1:37:57.560
 value chain

1:37:57.560 --> 1:37:59.560
 of creation and consumption got wrapped

1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:01.560
 in one software stack

1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:03.560
 within something like Snapchat or WhatsApp

1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:05.560
 the first week

1:38:05.560 --> 1:38:07.560
 they added disappearing messages

1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:09.560
 then two weeks later they added stories

1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:11.560
 the pace of innovation when you're on one software stack

1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:13.560
 you can

1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:15.560
 affect both creation and consumption

1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:17.560
 I think it's going to be rapid

1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:19.560
 so with these streaming services

1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:21.560
 we now for the first time in history

1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:23.560
 have enough I hope people

1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:25.560
 on one of these services

1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:27.560
 actually whether it's Spotify or Amazon

1:38:27.560 --> 1:38:29.560
 or Apple or YouTube

1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:31.560
 and hopefully enough creators

1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:33.560
 can do the format again

1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:35.560
 and that excites me

1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:37.560
 I think being able to change these constraints from 100 years

1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:39.560
 that could really

1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:41.560
 do something interesting

1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:43.560
 I really hope it's not just going to be there

1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:45.560
 iteration on the same thing

1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:47.560
 for the next 10 to 20 years as well

1:38:47.560 --> 1:38:49.560
 yeah changing the creation

1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:51.560
 of music or creation of audio

1:38:51.560 --> 1:38:53.560
 or creation of podcasts

1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:55.560
 is a really fascinating possibility

1:38:55.560 --> 1:38:57.560
 I myself don't understand

1:38:57.560 --> 1:38:59.560
 what it is about podcasts that's so intimate

1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:01.560
 it just is I listen to a lot of podcasts

1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:03.560
 I think it touches

1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:05.560
 on a human on a deep

1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:07.560
 human need for connection

1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:09.560
 that people do feel like they're

1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:11.560
 connected

1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:13.560
 to when they listen I don't understand

1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:15.560
 what the psychology that is

1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:17.560
 but in this world is becoming

1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:19.560
 more and more disconnected

1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:21.560
 it feels like

1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:23.560
 this is fulfilling a certain kind of

1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:25.560
 need and

1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:27.560
 empowering the creator as opposed

1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:29.560
 to just the listener

1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:31.560
 is really interesting

1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:33.560
 I'm really excited that you're working on this

1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:35.560
 yeah I think one of the things that is inspiring

1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:37.560
 for our teams to work on podcasts

1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:39.560
 is exactly that

1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:41.560
 whether you think like I probably do

1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:43.560
 that it's something biological about

1:39:43.560 --> 1:39:45.560
 perceiving to be in the middle of the conversation

1:39:45.560 --> 1:39:47.560
 that makes you listen in a different way

1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:49.560
 it doesn't really matter people seem to perceive it

1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:51.560
 differently and

1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:53.560
 there was this narrative for a long time that

1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:55.560
 you know if you look at video

1:39:55.560 --> 1:39:57.560
 it's something kind of in the foreground it got shorter

1:39:57.560 --> 1:39:59.560
 and shorter and shorter because of financial

1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:01.560
 pressures and monetization and so forth

1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:03.560
 and eventually at the end there's almost like

1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:05.560
 20 seconds clip

1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:07.560
 people just screaming something

1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:09.560
 and

1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:11.560
 I'm really I feel really good about

1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:13.560
 the fact that

1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:15.560
 you could have interpreted that as people have

1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:17.560
 no attention span anymore

1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:19.560
 they don't want to listen to things they're not interested

1:40:19.560 --> 1:40:21.560
 in deeper stories

1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:23.560
 like you know people are getting dumber

1:40:23.560 --> 1:40:25.560
 but then podcast came along and it's almost like no

1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:27.560
 no the need still existed

1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:29.560
 once but maybe maybe it was

1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:31.560
 the fact that you're not prepared to look at your

1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:33.560
 phone like this for two hours

1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:35.560
 but if you can drive at the same time it seems like

1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:37.560
 people really want to dig deeper

1:40:37.560 --> 1:40:39.560
 and they want to hear like the more complicated version

1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:41.560
 so to me that is very inspiring

1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:43.560
 that podcast is actually long form

1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:45.560
 it gives me a lot of hope for

1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:47.560
 for humanity that people seem really interested

1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:49.560
 in hearing deeper more complicated

1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:51.560
 conversations this is

1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:53.560
 I don't understand it

1:40:53.560 --> 1:40:55.560
 it's fascinating so the majority

1:40:55.560 --> 1:40:57.560
 for this podcast listen to the whole thing

1:40:57.560 --> 1:40:59.560
 this whole conversation

1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:01.560
 we've been talking for an hour and 45 minutes

1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:03.560
 and somebody will

1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:05.560
 I mean most people will be listening

1:41:05.560 --> 1:41:07.560
 to these words I'm speaking right now

1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:09.560
 you wouldn't have thought that 10 years ago

1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:11.560
 where the world seemed to go

1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:13.560
 that's very positive I think

1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:15.560
 that's really exciting and empowering the creator

1:41:15.560 --> 1:41:17.560
 there's as really exciting

1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:19.560
 last question

1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:21.560
 do you also have a passion for

1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:23.560
 just mobile in general

1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:25.560
 how do you see the smartphone world

1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:29.560
 the digital space

1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:31.560
 of

1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:33.560
 of smartphones

1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:35.560
 and just everything that's on the move

1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:37.560
 whether it's

1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:39.560
 internet of things and so on

1:41:39.560 --> 1:41:41.560
 changing over the next 10 years

1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:43.560
 and so on

1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:45.560
 I think that one way to think about it is that

1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:47.560
 computing

1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:49.560
 moving out of these

1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:51.560
 multi purpose devices

1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:53.560
 the computer we had in the phone

1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:55.560
 into specific

1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:57.560
 specific purpose devices

1:41:57.560 --> 1:41:59.560
 and it will be ambient that

1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:01.560
 at least in my home

1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:03.560
 you just shout something at someone

1:42:03.560 --> 1:42:05.560
 and there's always one of these speakers close enough

1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:07.560
 and so

1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:09.560
 you start behaving differently

1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:11.560
 it's as if you have the internet ambience

1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:13.560
 ambiently around you and you can ask it

1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:15.560
 things

1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:17.560
 so I think computing

1:42:17.560 --> 1:42:19.560
 will kind of get more integrated

1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:21.560
 and we won't necessarily think of it

1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:23.560
 as

1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:25.560
 connected to a device in the same way

1:42:25.560 --> 1:42:27.560
 that we do today

1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:29.560
 I don't know the path to that maybe

1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:31.560
 we used to have these

1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:33.560
 desktop computers

1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:35.560
 and then we partially replaced that with

1:42:35.560 --> 1:42:37.560
 the laptops and left

1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:39.560
 desktop at home and at work and then

1:42:39.560 --> 1:42:41.560
 we got these phones and we started leaving

1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:43.560
 the laptop at home for a while and maybe

1:42:43.560 --> 1:42:45.560
 for stretches of time

1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:47.560
 you're going to start using the watch and you can leave

1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:49.560
 your phone at home like for a run

1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:51.560
 or something and we're on this

1:42:51.560 --> 1:42:53.560
 progressive path where

1:42:53.560 --> 1:42:55.560
 I think

1:42:55.560 --> 1:42:57.560
 what is happening with

1:42:57.560 --> 1:42:59.560
 voice is that

1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:01.560
 you have an

1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:03.560
 interaction paradigm that doesn't

1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:05.560
 require

1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:07.560
 as large physical devices so I definitely

1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:09.560
 think there's a future where you can have

1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:11.560
 your Airpods and

1:43:11.560 --> 1:43:13.560
 your watch and you can do

1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:15.560
 a lot of computing

1:43:15.560 --> 1:43:17.560
 and I don't think

1:43:17.560 --> 1:43:19.560
 it's going to be this binary

1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:21.560
 thing, I think it's going to be like many of us

1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:23.560
 still have a laptop, we just use it less

1:43:23.560 --> 1:43:25.560
 and so you shift your consumption over

1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:27.560
 and

1:43:27.560 --> 1:43:29.560
 I don't know about

1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:31.560
 AR glasses and so forth

1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:33.560
 I'm excited about it, I spent a lot of time in that area

1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:35.560
 but I still think it's quite far away

1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:37.560
 AR, VR, all of that

1:43:37.560 --> 1:43:39.560
 Yeah, VR is happening and

1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:41.560
 working, I think the recent

1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:43.560
 Oculus Quest is quite impressive

1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:45.560
 I think AR is further away

1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:47.560
 at least that type of AR

1:43:47.560 --> 1:43:49.560
 but I do think

1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:53.560
 your phone or watch or glasses understanding

1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:55.560
 where you are and maybe what you're looking at

1:43:55.560 --> 1:43:57.560
 and being able to give you audio cues about that or you can say

1:43:57.560 --> 1:43:59.560
 like what is this and it tells you what it is

1:43:59.560 --> 1:44:01.560
 that I think

1:44:01.560 --> 1:44:03.560
 might happen, you use

1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:05.560
 your watch or your glasses as

1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:07.560
 a mouse pointer on reality

1:44:07.560 --> 1:44:09.560
 I think it might be a while before

1:44:09.560 --> 1:44:11.560
 I might be wrong, I hope I'm wrong but I think it might be a while

1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:13.560
 before we walk around with these big lab glasses

1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:15.560
 that project things

1:44:15.560 --> 1:44:17.560
 I agree with you, it's actually really

1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:19.560
 difficult when you have to

1:44:19.560 --> 1:44:21.560
 understand the physical world

1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:23.560
 enough to project

1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:25.560
 onto it

1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:27.560
 I lied about the last question

1:44:27.560 --> 1:44:29.560
 because I just thought

1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:31.560
 of audio

1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:33.560
 and my favorite topic which is the movie

1:44:33.560 --> 1:44:37.560
 Her, do you think

1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:39.560
 whether it's part of Spotify or not

1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:41.560
 will have

1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:43.560
 I don't know if you've seen the movie Her

1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:45.560
 absolutely

1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:47.560
 and there

1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:49.560
 audio is

1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:51.560
 the primary form of interaction

1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:53.560
 and the connection with another entity

1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:55.560
 that you can actually have a

1:44:55.560 --> 1:44:57.560
 relationship with or fall in love with

1:44:57.560 --> 1:44:59.560
 based on voice alone

1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:01.560
 audio alone

1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:03.560
 do you think that's possible first of all

1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:05.560
 based on audio alone to fall in love with somebody

1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:07.560
 somebody or well yeah let's go

1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:09.560
 with somebody, just have a relationship

1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:11.560
 based on audio alone

1:45:11.560 --> 1:45:13.560
 and second question to that

1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:15.560
 can we create an artificial intelligence system

1:45:15.560 --> 1:45:17.560
 that

1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:19.560
 allows one to fall in love

1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:21.560
 with it and her, him

1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:23.560
 with you

1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:25.560
 so this is my personal answer

1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:27.560
 speaking for me as a person

1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:29.560
 the answer is quite unequivocally

1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:31.560
 yes

1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:33.560
 on both

1:45:33.560 --> 1:45:35.560
 well we just said about podcasts

1:45:35.560 --> 1:45:37.560
 and the feeling of being in the middle of a conversation

1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:39.560
 if you could have an

1:45:39.560 --> 1:45:41.560
 assistant where

1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:43.560
 and we just said that feels like a very personal

1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:45.560
 setting so if you walk around with these

1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:47.560
 headphones and this thing, you're speaking with this

1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:49.560
 thing all of the time that feels like it's in your brain

1:45:49.560 --> 1:45:51.560
 I think it's

1:45:51.560 --> 1:45:53.560
 it's gonna be much easier to fall in love with

1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:55.560
 than something that would be on your screen

1:45:55.560 --> 1:45:57.560
 I think that's entirely possible

1:45:57.560 --> 1:45:59.560
 and then from the, you can probably answer this better than me

1:45:59.560 --> 1:46:01.560
 but from the concept of

1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:03.560
 if it's going to be possible

1:46:03.560 --> 1:46:05.560
 to build a machine

1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:07.560
 that can achieve that

1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:09.560
 I think whether you

1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:11.560
 think of it as, if you can fake it

1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:13.560
 the philosophical zombie that simulates it enough

1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:15.560
 or it somehow actually is

1:46:15.560 --> 1:46:17.560
 I think there's

1:46:17.560 --> 1:46:19.560
 it's only a question, if you ask me about time

1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:21.560
 I'd have to give an answer but if you say I've given

1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:23.560
 some half infinite time

1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:25.560
 absolutely, I think it's just

1:46:25.560 --> 1:46:27.560
 atoms and arrangement

1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:29.560
 of information

1:46:29.560 --> 1:46:31.560
 well, I personally think that love

1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:33.560
 is a lot simpler than people think

1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:35.560
 so we started with true romance

1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:37.560
 and ended in love

1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:39.560
 I don't see a better place to end

1:46:39.560 --> 1:46:40.560
 beautiful

1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:41.560
 Gustav, thanks so much for talking today

1:46:41.560 --> 1:46:55.560
 thank you so much, it was a lot of fun
