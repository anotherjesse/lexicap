 The following is a conversation with Ryan Hall, his second time in the podcast.

00:04.520 --> 00:09.040
 He's one of the most innovative scholars of martial arts in the modern era.

00:09.720 --> 00:14.720
 Quick mention of our sponsors, indeed hiring website, audible audiobooks,

00:14.960 --> 00:18.440
 ExpressVPN and Element Electrolyte Drink.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.880
 As a side note, let me say that I've gotten a chance to train with Ryan

00:25.880 --> 00:31.880
 recently and to both discuss and try out on the mat his ideas about grappling and fighting.

00:32.480 --> 00:37.160
 What struck me is his unapologetic drive to solve martial arts.

00:37.560 --> 00:43.080
 It reminds me of the ambitious vision and effort of Google's deep mind to solve intelligence.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.640
 In Ryan's case, this isn't some out there martial arts guru talk.

00:48.040 --> 00:52.600
 This is a style of thinking about the game of human chess of seeking to define

00:52.600 --> 00:58.880
 the rules and to engineer ways from first principles of escaping the constraints of those rules.

00:59.480 --> 01:04.480
 This style of thinking is rare, but is ultimately the one that leads to the discovery

01:04.480 --> 01:06.920
 of new revolutionary ideas.

01:07.840 --> 01:12.600

 And now here's my conversation with Ryan Hall.

01:16.680 --> 01:25.200
 You're known as a systems thinker in martial arts, but you also, I think, are willing to

01:25.200 --> 01:28.000
 think outside the rules of the game, outside of the system.

01:29.080 --> 01:35.480
 When you're thinking about strategies of how to solve the problem,

01:35.480 --> 01:40.000
 particular problem of an opponent, whether that's Jiu Jitsu or mixed martial arts.

01:40.440 --> 01:43.360
 What's your process for doing that, for figuring out that puzzle?

01:43.360 --> 01:47.960
 I would say, I don't know if I have a specific A to B to C process for that sort of thing.

01:47.960 --> 01:55.440
 I try to do my best to appreciate that I think a lot of the thinking, or maybe not all the

01:55.440 --> 02:01.720
 thing, but a lot of great thinking on conflict, on battle, on war, on martial arts has been

02:01.720 --> 02:02.400
 done already.

02:03.360 --> 02:07.800
 Not that we don't have to do any sort of background investigation or reassessing of these

02:07.800 --> 02:11.800
 ideas or axioms that have come down through things like the book of Five Rings or the

02:11.800 --> 02:19.240
 Art of War, or like Claustroids, even anything like that, really, but is trying to understand

02:19.800 --> 02:25.760
 the lessons of the past that I think oftentimes we don't take with us problems on.

02:25.760 --> 02:32.440
 We pay lip service and like, a victorious fighter, the great fighter, he knows victory is

02:32.440 --> 02:34.200
 there, then he seeks battle.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.240
 Everyone else is looking for victory in battle.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.680
 He had moving on and that's why I'm going to double jab and throw my left hand.

02:38.680 --> 02:45.080
 I think a lot of times our actions don't reflect our stated belief structure and I think that

02:45.080 --> 02:49.520
 oftentimes you can tell what I believe really or what my fundamental operating system is

02:49.520 --> 02:53.400
 based on my actions, whether I'm aware, I have an operating system internally, whether

02:53.400 --> 02:56.280
 I'm aware of it or not, or certainly whether I'm fully aware of it.

02:56.280 --> 03:01.760
 I guess when it comes to strategy, I try to think about how things interact.

03:01.760 --> 03:06.760
 You mentioned systems thinking and I try to do my best to understand how systems exist,

03:06.760 --> 03:10.200
 but I think that systems have a fundamental strength and a fundamental weakness.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.520
 They work how they work and that's great, but they're readable.

03:14.760 --> 03:20.600
 So if you are aware, if I am operating on a system of which you're not really read into,

03:21.240 --> 03:27.320
 then I think oftentimes I can seem like shockingly effective, particularly if my system

03:27.320 --> 03:31.960
 preys on certain weaknesses that maybe you're given to.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.320
 But what happens when you've read the same books that I have?

03:35.320 --> 03:38.120
 I think that a lot of times that makes me deeply predictable.

03:38.120 --> 03:45.080
 I think about systems in jujitsu and a lot of times people think that they're doing jujitsu

03:45.080 --> 03:47.240
 when in reality they are doing an expression of it.

03:47.240 --> 03:52.920
 Let's say I'll use, there's the Marcello Garcia system, there is the Hensel Gracie current

03:52.920 --> 03:57.960
 Hensel Gracie system, there's the old Gracie Baja one, there's the Gracie Academy,

03:57.960 --> 04:03.960
 classic Gracie jujitsu, there's the art of jujitsu, kind of Otto's approach.

04:03.960 --> 04:11.320
 There's some crossover between a lot of these, but oftentimes I think when it comes to

04:12.120 --> 04:16.120
 understanding how I'm making decisions and how my opponent is making decisions,

04:16.120 --> 04:20.600
 I have to appreciate whether or not I'm an end user of something and I'll use my phone as an

04:20.600 --> 04:25.880
 example. I was thinking of this the other day and as an end user of my phone, I have no idea what

04:25.880 --> 04:30.040
 it does. Like Edward Snowden comes up and goes, hey guys, you realize your phones are listening

04:30.040 --> 04:35.800
 to you from like, really? What? All right, I believe you. And then of course that comes out,

04:35.800 --> 04:41.800
 but to what extent? I have no idea. What is my phone capable of? I have no idea.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.240
 I can mess with the font though. I really like blue screens, not purple screens.

04:45.240 --> 04:49.080
 So like as an end user, I can change some of the bells and whistles that have nothing to do with

04:49.080 --> 04:52.840
 the underlying source code of it all or how it functions the same way in my car. I'm an end user

04:52.840 --> 04:56.360
 of my car. If I do this with the steering wheel, it goes. If I push on the gas, it goes.

04:56.360 --> 05:00.280
 If I, yeah, I know how to fix it when it's out of gas. I know how to fix it when it's

05:00.280 --> 05:05.640
 out of oil. And I know how to fix it when a flat tire comes. But short of that,

05:05.640 --> 05:10.920
 or actually beyond that, I have nothing. So I think that oftentimes, I've been around in Jitsu

05:10.920 --> 05:16.120
 long enough to encounter like a new wave of good grapplers. And it's very, very interesting sometimes

05:16.120 --> 05:20.600
 how they're running systems. They don't realize they're running. I'm like, oh yeah, I trained at

05:20.600 --> 05:27.000
 Marcello Garcia's Academy for a long time. And a big fan of Marcello's was a student there. Encountered

05:27.000 --> 05:33.720
 a lot of the Otto style Jiu Jitsu a number of years ago, been a very, very deep into

05:33.720 --> 05:39.080
 footlocking and leg attacks and whatnot for a long, long time. I understand your system better

05:39.080 --> 05:43.320
 than you do or I may. And let's say you understand my system better than I do. That would be a huge

05:43.320 --> 05:47.640
 issue. That was something that I encountered a long time ago, trying to come up in Jiu Jitsu where

05:47.640 --> 05:54.840
 I was trying to utilize systems that were created by let's say Hafa Mendes or someone else. And I'm

05:54.840 --> 05:59.240
 basically trying to do what you're doing. I'm just not doing as good of a version of it. So not only

05:59.240 --> 06:04.440
 am I not doing it well, but I'm entirely predictable. And I think that that can be a big issue. So to

06:04.440 --> 06:08.760
 come back, I think of systems a lot of times now in terms of particularly like end user type of

06:08.760 --> 06:13.240
 systems like an iPhone is a really, really fast way for me to be able to do all sorts of things.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.000
 If you were to take it from me, I couldn't recreate any of that.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.280
 So you want to be more the NSA unless the end user.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.520
 Exactly. Exactly. That way, that way I'm listening to you.

06:22.520 --> 06:23.880
 I'm going to be the NSA of combat.

06:23.880 --> 06:29.880
 That's right. We're watching UP. But basically, I guess what I would come back and say is,

06:30.680 --> 06:35.240
 if you understand how things interact on a fundamental level and what type of games exist and

06:35.240 --> 06:40.280
 what type of interactions exist, then you can transcend a lot of the systems. It's almost

06:40.280 --> 06:45.240
 like a cook versus if I can make certain things in the kitchen, but I am not a chef,

06:45.240 --> 06:50.200
 you could give me a bunch of ingredients and I could probably cook not well, but a couple of

06:50.200 --> 06:56.360
 different things. But a master chef would be aware of the implications of all of the things that

06:56.360 --> 07:02.200
 they're doing extra time in the oven, less time in the oven, putting this flavoring or spice in,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.440
 what you're doing with various things. And also, they could make, they could turn all of these

07:06.440 --> 07:09.080
 ingredients into Chinese food. They could turn all these ingredients into Italian food and they

07:09.080 --> 07:13.400
 could turn all these Italian food ingredients into chicken parmesan or it could turn into lasagna.

07:13.400 --> 07:18.360
 But they're not limited to a specific thing because they have knowledge of how food interacts,

07:18.360 --> 07:22.120
 how, what it does to create taste, what it does to create texture. So to come back,

07:22.120 --> 07:27.400
 let's take rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors is built on the idea of a couple of

07:27.400 --> 07:30.520
 different things. Actually, I'll tell you what, can I, may I ask you a question?

07:30.520 --> 07:31.000
 Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.120
 What's your favorite dinosaur? On the same, on three we'll go. One, two, three.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.400
 T.Rex.

07:37.400 --> 07:44.360
 T.Rex. So me too. Man, this is, we're going to be best friends. So it's, okay. So what's the

07:44.360 --> 07:46.920
 first question when you say, hey, let's play rock, paper, scissors. It's like, hey, is it

07:46.920 --> 07:50.280
 rock, paper, scissors or rock, paper, scissors shoot? And you're like, rock, paper, scissors,

07:50.280 --> 07:55.960
 shoot. And you're like, okay, because if we go rock, paper, scissors, shoot. And I'm like, oh,

07:55.960 --> 08:01.720
 man, I got lucky and I won. Imagine I won a hundred times in a row. I'd be luck. I'd be luck

08:02.280 --> 08:06.840
 if I was honestly doing that. But now let's say, for instance, I go on rock, paper, scissors and

08:06.840 --> 08:13.480
 you go on shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Here comes the rock, right? If you lose,

08:14.280 --> 08:22.440
 whose fault is it? It's yours. This is built on a parody thing where I don't get to pick second.

08:22.440 --> 08:26.760
 If I get to pick second, it's like being able to investigate your background before going to

08:26.760 --> 08:31.400
 meet you. And then I'm like, oh, hi. Oh, I too love the New Jersey, you know, the New Jersey Nets,

08:31.400 --> 08:35.640
 which is a statement that no one in their right mind would ever make when I was growing up.

08:35.640 --> 08:41.560
 So anyway, you'd have to have personal knowledge of somebody. So anyway, to come back, if you

08:41.560 --> 08:48.120
 understand how games are structured, you can start to realize that there's huge gaps and

08:48.120 --> 08:53.880
 huge holes in a lot of the thinking behind all of it. And if you can create the illusion of choice,

08:53.880 --> 08:56.680
 I'll play one more. If you don't mind, this is one of my favorite ones to do this in class all the

08:56.680 --> 09:01.800
 time. Have you seen this before? No. Okay. May I ask you some questions, please? Sure. Okay,

09:01.800 --> 09:06.920
 fantastic. I'm scared. There's everybody wins. Don't worry. All right. So could you, could you

09:06.920 --> 09:13.160
 please? I would. Could you please pick three fingers and tell me what they are? Your thumb.

09:13.160 --> 09:19.880
 Okay. Your pinky. Okay. And your middle finger. Okay. So could you please pick two fingers?

09:21.320 --> 09:25.400
 Your middle finger and your pinky. Okay. Could you please pick one finger?

09:25.400 --> 09:30.520
 I'll go with middle finger. Okay. Could you please pick one finger?

09:31.560 --> 09:35.560
 Pinky. Okay. Let's play again. Can you pick one finger, please?

09:40.200 --> 09:46.120
 Your middle finger. Okay. Can you pick one finger, please? Your thumb. Yeah. Your pinky.

09:47.640 --> 09:53.640
 Okay. Now pick two more fingers, please. Your middle finger and your ring finger.

09:53.640 --> 10:00.040
 Okay. Could you please pick one more finger? Damn it. So I thought that enhanced the illusion

10:00.040 --> 10:05.960
 of choice. It's the illusion of choice. If I'm asking the questions provided I asked the right

10:05.960 --> 10:11.880
 questions, there can be no correct answer. It doesn't mean that ultimately, if that's what

10:11.880 --> 10:15.880
 you wanted, let's say like I thought I was guiding you to something I wanted that turns out that was

10:15.880 --> 10:19.560
 the outcome you wanted. Now let's, here's, now I'm going to ask the wrong questions. I might not

10:19.560 --> 10:24.520
 get what I want. Oh, by the way, sorry to interrupt. For people that might be just listening to this,

10:25.320 --> 10:30.520
 that no matter what trajectory we took through that decision tree that Ryan was presenting,

10:30.520 --> 10:37.000
 it was, it was ending up with a middle finger, ironically enough. I was surprised. So, and...

10:37.000 --> 10:42.520
 All of us were surprised. And we're both winners. Yeah. We all, everyone was. I felt like a winner.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.280
 All right. So now, now I'm going to, now I'll ask some different questions if you don't mind.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.840
 Can you please pick two fingers to put down?

10:51.800 --> 10:53.480
 Your middle finger and your pinky.

10:54.840 --> 10:58.760
 Oh, that's so awkward. That's like the worst finger positions. Okay. Can you please pick,

10:58.760 --> 11:03.960
 wait a minute. That's, oh, hold on. Yeah. Well, what if you pick two other fingers to put down?

11:05.720 --> 11:09.480
 You're thumbing your pinky. Okay. My thumb on my pinky. Can you please pick two fingers to put down?

11:09.480 --> 11:16.680
 Well, whatever it is you like. Okay. Your middle finger and your pointy finger.

11:17.720 --> 11:21.320
 Okay. Can you pick two fingers to put down? What's the name? It's index finger. Index finger.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.560
 That's the one we usually point. It's weird to point with your ring finger.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.320
 Sorry. What do... Two more to put down, please.

11:30.840 --> 11:36.600
 The middle finger and the ring finger. Ah, man. Is it, what if you pick my ring finger

11:36.600 --> 11:42.120
 and my index finger? Yeah. Aha. Woohoo. I win. Yeah. So even though I'm asking the questions,

11:42.120 --> 11:46.920
 it's not impossible that I arrive at a good outcome for me, but it's no longer guaranteed.

11:46.920 --> 11:51.000
 I went from a situation where I literally can't lose. Yeah. It's pretty low probability.

11:51.560 --> 11:55.400
 Right. Super low probability. And the second you realize what I'm doing, you would never

11:55.400 --> 12:00.200
 let me win because the ball's truly in your court. So I guess that's kind of what I'm

12:00.200 --> 12:05.720
 fundamentally trying to put into play almost all the time. Can I ask the right set of questions?

12:05.720 --> 12:11.800
 Can I develop the ability skills wise, understanding wise, and then discipline wise,

12:11.800 --> 12:16.920
 and then have the courage and the constitution and the discipline necessary, the patience,

12:16.920 --> 12:23.640
 necessary to ask the proper questions and wait for the proper answers? And if I can,

12:25.160 --> 12:28.920
 all assuming like the perfect world, I win period.

12:29.800 --> 12:33.640
 Yeah. So does that make sense? Yeah. It totally makes sense. So I don't know if you know

12:33.640 --> 12:38.360
 sort of the more mathematical discipline of game theory. There's something called mechanism design.

12:39.000 --> 12:46.040
 So game theory is this field where you model some kind of interaction between human beings.

12:46.040 --> 12:52.360
 You can model grappling that way. You can model nuclear conflict between nations that way. And

12:53.560 --> 13:01.640
 you set up a set of rules and incentives, and then use math to predict what is likely outcome,

13:01.640 --> 13:10.120
 depending over time, based on the interaction given those rules. Mechanism design is the design of

13:10.120 --> 13:19.400
 games. So like the design of systems that are likely to lead to a certain outcome. And so what

13:19.400 --> 13:27.560
 you're suggesting is you want to create, you want to discover systems whose decision tree,

13:27.560 --> 13:34.200
 all the possible things that could happen, feel like there's choice being made. But ultimately,

13:34.200 --> 13:39.480
 one of the parties doesn't have any choice in what the actual final outcome is.

13:40.760 --> 13:45.720
 You're making them feel like they're playing a game too. So it's not like you don't feel trapped.

13:46.520 --> 13:51.240
 It's kind of like... Well, the best traps, you don't look very threatening. So I'm like,

13:51.240 --> 13:57.240
 I'll walk over there. I guess that's kind of an interesting thing. If alliance...

13:57.240 --> 14:02.360
 When does a lion roar? It's an interesting thing when you watch lions hunting. They don't roar

14:02.360 --> 14:07.320
 when they hunt. When they want to move you back, they do stuff like that. When they actually want

14:07.320 --> 14:11.400
 to come and get you, they're pretty slinky. It's like water covered. It's like furry water.

14:12.200 --> 14:18.760
 And I guess when you keep that in mind, it's funny how... For us, the hobby actually,

14:18.760 --> 14:22.760
 you know, brilliant guy, one of my MMA coaches and head coach at TriStar,

14:22.760 --> 14:25.800
 he brought this up one time, thought it was a really salient point. So let's say we have a

14:25.800 --> 14:30.920
 million person bracket. It was impossibly huge. Like Frank Dukes went in the kumite level huge

14:30.920 --> 14:35.640
 bracket. He claimed to knock out like 250 consecutive people. And you're like, that is

14:36.520 --> 14:41.240
 all of Hong Kong was in that thing and everyone kept their mouth shut. But anyway, that's pretty

14:41.240 --> 14:46.200
 cool. But to come back, a little improbable, pretty cool. So let's say, for instance,

14:46.200 --> 14:49.720
 like there's no cheating going on. No cheating going on and we're flipping coins, right?

14:49.720 --> 14:55.400
 And someone is going to have an unbroken string of victory through that bracket,

14:56.840 --> 15:02.600
 which is pretty insane. How many consecutive like toss ups this person won. And then at the end of

15:02.600 --> 15:09.000
 it all, imagine we like aliens show up and we go, hey, they want to flip a coin for whether or

15:09.000 --> 15:16.600
 not Earth gets to continue. They'll be like, oh, I'll do it. I'm good at this.

15:16.600 --> 15:23.400
 That would be tempting as a person to do you like, I'm a lucky guy. Are you sure? Maybe,

15:23.400 --> 15:26.200
 I mean, maybe effectively or we could argue that effectively, you're incredibly lucky.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.800
 But basically, is that an actual ability as like a perk in a video game? Or is that just

15:29.800 --> 15:35.880
 this thing that happened? So anyway, how many times are someone, you could go through an entire

15:35.880 --> 15:41.240
 career, you know, particularly in a fight sport. Well, let's say you get 15 knockouts and 15 toss

15:41.240 --> 15:44.520
 up scenarios, because you see that happening all the time in the fight game, a toss up scenario.

15:44.520 --> 15:48.840
 It's not like you're mounted on me and like, and that's not a toss up scenario. Many, many,

15:48.840 --> 15:52.840
 many, many striking scenarios. A lot of grappling ones, but tons of striking scenarios are dead

15:52.840 --> 15:58.120
 toss ups. And somebody wins by knockout, they win five times in a row, then they lose a couple

15:58.120 --> 16:00.840
 times in a row, we go, what happened? You're like, what do you mean what happened? They were always

16:00.840 --> 16:04.840
 flipping the coin. And then they win five more and they go, ah, back on track. Can you imagine

16:04.840 --> 16:09.640
 that you're flipping a coin, I'm like, heads, heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, heads again.

16:09.640 --> 16:13.880
 Oh man, I'm back on it. I'm flipping good now. That's basically what's going on. I think the

16:13.880 --> 16:20.760
 vast majority of the time, and then humanity's tendency to see a sign in almost anything starts

16:20.760 --> 16:25.240
 to present itself. And then we build a narrative in our mind to convince ourselves that we're in

16:25.240 --> 16:30.600
 some sort of control. And in reality, I was in a marginal situation at best the whole time.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.800
 Yeah, without having much control, without having a deep understanding of the system,

16:33.800 --> 16:38.760
 the same stories told the stock market with many of these distributed human systems.

16:38.760 --> 16:43.960
 We start telling narratives and start seeing patterns without understanding actually the system

16:43.960 --> 16:47.720
 that's generating these patterns. So if we can see the system, that's incredibly valuable,

16:47.720 --> 16:51.640
 but then you go, well, what system is above all of the systems? And I can see maybe physics,

16:51.640 --> 16:55.160
 maybe something like game theory explains these things, but like, I guess, what are the,

16:55.160 --> 16:59.000
 what aspects of the system can I, can I put my hands on that I can touch and understand?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.920
 And what am I, what am I missing? What, what, what's going on in the world all around me to

17:02.920 --> 17:08.680
 continue to lean on, on Dune that I don't have, that I don't, you know, you talk to a blind person

17:08.680 --> 17:12.920
 about, about the world, about sight and talk to someone that doesn't have everyone who's got

17:12.920 --> 17:18.120
 coronavirus now so no one can taste or smell. They're like, this is delicious. Like, is it?

17:18.120 --> 17:23.880
 So anyway, you know, again, what, what senses am I missing or what understanding am I missing

17:23.880 --> 17:30.200
 that's preventing me from seeing the dots connect in the world all around me? And I think sometimes

17:30.200 --> 17:35.240
 if we are oftentimes, at least personally, I've screwed this up a lot. I'm so nose deep in the,

17:35.240 --> 17:38.840
 in the trench of trying to understand what I'm doing that I can't take a step back and realize,

17:39.400 --> 17:43.640
 you know, that I'm in a forest, not just head, head butting a tree. And I may be doing both,

17:43.640 --> 17:48.440
 maybe both, two things should be true at once. But so I would say when it comes to strategy,

17:48.440 --> 17:53.080
 trying to understand that, but then also you go, well, okay, well, how can that sounds cool,

17:53.080 --> 17:57.080
 but how can you actually do that? And then I'd say that's a really good question because if

17:57.080 --> 18:00.440
 I imagine I say, man, I should fight like Steven Thompson, I should fight like Wonder Boy. It's

18:00.440 --> 18:06.200
 like, good idea. Go do that. I'm like, I'm not thinking about the guy I would fight like

18:06.200 --> 18:10.920
 could be even a bag of Madoff if I could, you know, it seems to work. So anyway, you go, well,

18:10.920 --> 18:15.960
 what if I could develop, what if I could take my time developing skills so that when these

18:15.960 --> 18:21.160
 strategies become apparent that you are, they are executable to you, you actually have the ability

18:21.160 --> 18:25.800
 to like, in or to again, to be the person in the arena that be the person required,

18:25.800 --> 18:29.800
 where there's plenty of great ideas like dunking a basketball is a fantastic idea.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.560
 Alas, for me, unless there's a small trampoline nearby, I'm not the guy,

18:33.560 --> 18:37.880
 but that doesn't make it any less good of an idea. I just don't, I haven't developed the ability

18:37.880 --> 18:42.520
 or I lack the ability. So anyway, I think a lot of times, at least when I watch people in fighting,

18:42.520 --> 18:46.920
 I'll use an example, we're so concerned, we're so concerned with trying to win early on,

18:46.920 --> 18:51.400
 rather than develop skills that I'm going like, well, what's the best way to fight with my current

18:51.400 --> 18:56.920
 set of skills? And usually the path forward is like the barbarian route, like you put on the one

18:56.920 --> 19:00.680
 ring, take the damage you need to take to hit that guy. And that was something I realized very

19:00.680 --> 19:04.840
 early on in my MMA career was like, I'm not that good at striking at that time, not a world class

19:04.840 --> 19:08.600
 striker now, but I'm way better at striking than I'm given any credit for because it helps people

19:08.600 --> 19:14.600
 sleep at night, I think. But I'm serious. But yeah, you're always introduced as like this master

19:16.600 --> 19:19.720
 grappler. I'm like, that's nice of them to say that. Maybe I'm not that good at grappling,

19:19.720 --> 19:23.080
 we haven't even seen that. And but the funny thing is when I'm like, just because people almost

19:23.080 --> 19:26.040
 go like, well, Lex, like, see, you're really good at this, but you got to understand, like,

19:26.040 --> 19:29.400
 we're equal, man, like, I'm good at this other thing. Maybe you're really good at what you do,

19:29.400 --> 19:33.400
 and I'm just mediocre at what I do. That's also possible. So there's plenty of people that define

19:33.400 --> 19:36.920
 themselves as a striker that do that just because that's for lack of other options, not because

19:36.920 --> 19:39.880
 they're a really good striker, or like I'm a grappler, I was a grappler as a blue belt.

19:40.440 --> 19:46.040
 Not really. So anyway, I guess to come back, if I'm constantly going, how can I win with what

19:46.040 --> 19:49.880
 I've got right now? I think oftentimes I never take the time to develop the skills that I want

19:49.880 --> 19:52.920
 to develop. And I also never take the time to develop the strategies that I want to develop.

19:52.920 --> 19:57.560
 And that has actually been one big blessing of fighting someone frequently, which has been

19:57.560 --> 20:01.720
 really frustrating as a result of injuries and time away and, you know, some of those people

20:01.720 --> 20:06.920
 being hesitant to get in the game. But it gives you so much time to be out of the trenches and

20:06.920 --> 20:10.840
 focus on developing your abilities so that now it's almost like developing money, like you

20:10.840 --> 20:14.680
 mentioned the stock market that you can now put in. Imagine you told me Bitcoin was a great idea

20:14.680 --> 20:18.840
 five years ago and I had eight bucks. Man, if someone told me Bitcoin was a great idea five

20:18.840 --> 20:23.240
 years ago and I had, you know, 50K, I'd be like, oh my God, I'd be sleeping in my bed of money

20:23.240 --> 20:27.800
 that I would then set on fire later today just to do it. So all the due to all the injuries

20:27.800 --> 20:31.560
 you've been mining Bitcoin all this time and now you're a rich man? Well, no, actually,

20:31.560 --> 20:36.360
 someone told me I was trying to mine for Bitcoin actually, like in a cave. And then I found out

20:36.360 --> 20:40.680
 recently that it's actually mining is like a figure of speech. Not like a literal thing that

20:40.680 --> 20:45.000
 you do. But I mean, in my defense, English language is difficult. It is. It really is.

20:45.000 --> 20:51.400
 Next time, talk to me, I'll explain. And Russian is more is a rich language. You should learn.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.720
 You should learn Russian. I'll help you out. I believe you. Thank you. Can you do a whirlwind

20:56.360 --> 21:05.000
 overview of your career in MMA leading up to this point with the injuries and the undefeated

21:05.000 --> 21:12.040
 record? And then what's next? Since we're on the topic, I did my first fight in a, as a

21:12.040 --> 21:15.640
 blue belt, and I've been training for about a year and a half. I did nine jujitsu tournaments

21:15.640 --> 21:18.920
 in 10 weekends or eight, maybe eight jujitsu tournaments in 10 weekends prior to my first

21:18.920 --> 21:24.760
 fight in April 2006. I got punched in the face a whole bunch. I didn't realize it was a professional

21:24.760 --> 21:29.400
 fight and found that out like the day beforehand. That was great. Thanks, coach.

21:29.400 --> 21:35.160
 I was in Atlantic City, where another place no one ever goes on purpose. So that wasn't great.

21:35.160 --> 21:42.280
 I got into three, actually three car accidents in the preceding 36 hours before the fight. I had

21:42.280 --> 21:49.160
 my car totaled. I wasn't driving for any of them. That was great. It was 2006. 2006. Yeah.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.880
 You were blue belt? Yeah. Yeah. I've been training for about a year and a half.

21:51.880 --> 21:56.120
 To blue belt. You're getting, I mean, if you haven't lived, if you haven't gotten punched

21:56.120 --> 22:01.640
 in the face in Atlantic City. That's true. I mean, I would have loved to have it happen

22:01.640 --> 22:05.800
 for different reasons. Yeah. But yeah. Well, what's funny is that, you know, I remember,

22:05.800 --> 22:09.880
 you know, getting punched in the face a bunch, trying to do inverted guard. I won one round,

22:09.880 --> 22:13.800
 lost two rounds, definitely lost the fight. So you went for inverted, sorry to interrupt,

22:13.800 --> 22:16.520
 you went for inverted guard. Can you tell the story of that fight real quick?

22:16.520 --> 22:19.880
 Yeah, sure. It was three, three minute rounds, which is not a professional fight length,

22:19.880 --> 22:22.440
 although I don't know if professional fight length would have been any better. It's just

22:22.440 --> 22:26.920
 more time to get punched. But I found out part way through, I was like, I remember walking

22:26.920 --> 22:29.480
 back to my corner in the first round, I'm like, yeah, this guy can't hurt me. And he's like,

22:29.480 --> 22:33.800
 yeah, my corner was my friend, Tom, and then someone else. And then he's like, yeah, I would

22:33.800 --> 22:36.680
 still encourage you to stop blocking somebody punches with your face. I'm like, yeah, it's

22:36.680 --> 22:41.320
 going to be a thumb. I appreciate that. I'm going to try that. Anyway, I remember, like,

22:41.320 --> 22:45.560
 I was not, you're not allowed to up kick. So I'm like, great. I was, I had no martial arts

22:45.560 --> 22:49.000
 skills at really at all. But if I had anything at all, it was Jiu Jitsu. It was very, very little

22:49.000 --> 22:54.280
 Jiu Jitsu. But definitely no wrestling, definitely no striking. Like I was basically a magnet for

22:54.280 --> 23:00.200
 punches. So that was your time, you know, rough neck and out in Atlantic City, as we all do

23:00.200 --> 23:04.840
 once in a while. Can we fast forward to when you're actually dominating the world as a black belt?

23:04.840 --> 23:07.240
 Well, actually, it's funny, because I took the little bit of money that I, they're like, hey,

23:07.240 --> 23:11.080
 we're paying. I'm like, really? It's like Bukowski stories with Ryan Hall.

23:11.800 --> 23:15.240
 Well, then I went to the casino, I went to whatever like the Tropicana that was right

23:15.240 --> 23:18.280
 there, the casino, because that was a bore wall call. I'm like, you know what, man,

23:18.280 --> 23:21.960
 this was, this has been a not great, not great evening. I'm going to, this is, I'm going to win

23:21.960 --> 23:26.360
 it back. This is going to be great. 15 minutes later, they had all the money that I had from

23:26.360 --> 23:31.080
 the fight was gone. I remember like walking out of the casino, super pissed. And like,

23:31.080 --> 23:34.600
 I don't know what I was thinking. Like, I'm not good at gambling. Why? This was not going to make

23:34.600 --> 23:37.720
 my night better. I just thought that there was going to be some sort of cosmic balancing. And

23:37.720 --> 23:40.040
 maybe it was the cosmic balancing all at once, where things had done in the past.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.680
 Longer term though, the balancing.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.400
 We'll see. I hope so. But to come.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.920
 We're all dead in the end though.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.000
 That is true. Time will get us all. Yeah.

23:50.200 --> 23:54.360
 Well, that was, so that was the first one. And that was when I realized I'm terrible at MMA,

23:54.360 --> 23:58.520
 but I like it. I should just stop this until I one day learn how to actually grapple,

23:58.520 --> 24:01.720
 much less learn how to fight. But I remember this guy named Dave Kaplan, who's the reason my

24:01.720 --> 24:05.720
 ears are all messed up, who was on the ultimate fighter and got punched in the face and knocked

24:05.720 --> 24:10.360
 out by Tom Lawler, who I'll always appreciate for doing that. But anyway,

24:10.360 --> 24:14.920
 Dave or Tom, I appreciate Tom, I appreciate Dave too. David was great. Dave was just a huge bully

24:14.920 --> 24:19.480
 and used to like, not completely unmercifully, but relatively unmercifully beat the crap out of

24:19.480 --> 24:25.000
 me. And anyway, the ears look good. So I appreciate that. I tell people it's a tumor that I got.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.360
 And I'm going to, if they want in on a class action lawsuit with AT&T, they should, you know,

24:29.640 --> 24:34.520
 send me an email. But anyway, you're very financially savvy. Very good.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.480
 And now I just give the impression, Dave basically said, Hey, don't worry, man,

24:37.480 --> 24:41.000
 you're never going to be good at MMA. And you're never going to be good at grappling either.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.960
 But even if you are good at grappling, which in my opinion, you will never be, you will never be

24:45.960 --> 24:51.080
 good at fighting. And I said, Dave, if I do nothing else in my life, I'm going to keep training until

24:51.080 --> 24:54.760
 I can make you pay for that. And now that I can make him pay for that really easily, he doesn't

24:54.760 --> 24:58.440
 train anymore. But I love Dave. Dave's awesome. He actually won the singing bee. What an interesting

24:58.440 --> 25:03.640
 dude. Super interesting guy. But anyway, none of the Virginia, like speaks a couple languages,

25:03.640 --> 25:08.360
 super interesting guy, like shockingly good at Jeopardy too. Not that I'm any good,

25:08.360 --> 25:11.480
 but still shockingly good at Jeopardy. So anyway, years later, I met Faraz Ahabi,

25:11.480 --> 25:15.880
 actually, John Danahar. I met John Danahar and he put me in touch with Faraz Ahabi. I started

25:15.880 --> 25:19.240
 training at TriStar, you know, immediately loved working with Faraz and learning under

25:19.240 --> 25:23.000
 Faraz, started training at TriStar. And I did my first real professional MMA fight

25:23.800 --> 25:29.960
 as someone that actually does, had practiced a little bit higher in, I think, August 2012.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.600
 And that was against a guy, he was four and five at the time. So, you know, had some experience,

25:36.600 --> 25:41.480
 good kind of like first go for me, honestly, and won that fight by TKO. And then it was a

25:41.480 --> 25:45.720
 little bit of a time off and then I did another fight against a tough guy named Majid Hamo.

25:45.720 --> 25:48.840
 He was five and two at the time. I think he was three and I was amateur. He had a good little

25:48.840 --> 25:53.400
 bit of fighting experience. Won that one in the first round of Iron Rear Naked Choke and then

25:54.440 --> 25:58.200
 started to experience difficulty getting, getting fights at that point.

25:59.480 --> 26:04.440
 You continue to introduce as like the, the, the master of grappling, the submission.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.600
 At least that was, that was my thing. If I don't know if I was.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.600
 Is that was the source of the fear for people?

26:08.600 --> 26:12.920
 I think so, because I mean, I definitely wasn't much at striking at that point. You know, I

26:12.920 --> 26:17.080
 definitely am a lot, I'd like to think I'm pretty hard to hurt, although I try not to lean on that.

26:17.080 --> 26:21.960
 And I played baseball for like 16 years so I can hit things pretty hard. I just wasn't able to,

26:21.960 --> 26:25.720
 I, I recognized pretty early on that I had no idea how to actually hit things

26:25.720 --> 26:31.000
 hard without becoming hittable myself. So I think that's kind of the big thing is a lot of times,

26:31.000 --> 26:36.520
 like we almost, we were mentioning before, if you try to go and get people too early,

26:36.520 --> 26:40.840
 you can hit them if they're not that good, but you're going to get hit yourself. So you're making,

26:40.840 --> 26:45.320
 you're basically making a wager, you're making a trade of your own life for the ability to hit them.

26:45.320 --> 26:48.760
 When you watch guys like Israel out of Sonia, Floyd Mayweather, Stephen Thompson,

26:49.400 --> 26:53.560
 Conor McGregor, when he's fighting really well, it's not a trade. They're not,

26:53.560 --> 26:58.440
 you're hitting them and they're hitting you. It's, they're hitting you, but it takes years and years

26:58.440 --> 27:01.640
 and years and years to be able to learn how to do that. Ton Lee is another great example of that.

27:01.640 --> 27:06.120
 You know, my closest training partner, one of my best friends, and currently now one champion,

27:06.840 --> 27:11.240
 one championship in Asia, the champion of the featherweight, or I guess lightweight featherweight,

27:12.120 --> 27:17.720
 155 over there now. And he recently defeated Martin Wynn in a really great fight and Ton

27:17.720 --> 27:21.720
 knocked him out, long time champion. And Ton doesn't let you hit him. He doesn't let you

27:21.720 --> 27:26.920
 touch him. I feel so fortunate to have met guys like Stephen and Ton to go early on in career and

27:26.920 --> 27:32.120
 go, holy moly, I can't even, it's not even like, oh, you'll let me walk over and find you. It's

27:32.120 --> 27:36.040
 like fighting a ghost that periodically shows up with a hammer and smokes you in the melon and

27:36.040 --> 27:40.040
 then disappears into the ether again. So the way they approach the fighting game is thinking,

27:40.040 --> 27:45.640
 how can I attack without being hit? So every, every strategy, every idea you have about what

27:45.640 --> 27:53.000
 you're going to do has to do with like that minimizing the return. Absolutely. I mean,

27:53.000 --> 27:56.280
 that's what all good fighting is done. All poor fighting, if, you know, throughout the course

27:56.280 --> 28:01.400
 history of most generals, whether I saw a read or, you know, they, they did battles by attrition.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.920
 You know, it's like, yeah, man, I've got 150 guys, you've got 50, like, yeah,

28:04.920 --> 28:09.080
 60 of my guys die killing your 50, like that's great for me. But it's not so great for the

28:09.080 --> 28:14.200
 60 guys that died. You know, I hope it's worth it. So when you realize that not only you're not just

28:14.200 --> 28:18.120
 Kobe Bryant and you're Phil Jackson too, you got to do everything. You know,

28:18.840 --> 28:23.400
 if you've got to run across the beach at Normandy, so be it. But that better be, you should have,

28:23.400 --> 28:25.960
 make sure we thought this through. And there's like, Hey, there's no way we can like,

28:25.960 --> 28:30.680
 you know, walk around the side, huh? Because oftentimes there, there is. And I think a lot

28:30.680 --> 28:34.680
 of times there's a lot of incentives in professional fighting too, for people to want to do that.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.400
 And we come up with all sorts of, well, I'm trying to be exciting.

28:38.280 --> 28:42.280
 Are you? Is that really what you came here to do? Because I came here to win. And I think that

28:42.280 --> 28:45.640
 anyone that that's really successful came there to win. And if it ends up being exciting, well,

28:45.640 --> 28:49.000
 that's fantastic. I hope that people enjoy watching something. And that's great. But

28:49.000 --> 28:53.640
 that's a qualitative assessment. Anyway, you know, you want to also be able to, you know,

28:53.640 --> 28:57.400
 live the rest of your life. I think it's easy. You know, I'll use Meldrick Taylor,

28:57.400 --> 29:01.640
 I'm a big boxing fan. Meldrick Taylor is an excellent fighter, came this close

29:02.600 --> 29:06.760
 to a world title and was stopped with like, he was in a fight that he was winning with

29:06.760 --> 29:10.040
 seconds remaining, literally seconds remaining, and they probably could have just let it go.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.560
 And he would have been world champion. And it was brutal. If you ever watch legendary nights,

29:13.560 --> 29:18.760
 like HBO boxing show, it's great. But it's heartbreaking. It's absolutely heartbreaking.

29:18.760 --> 29:22.840
 And also like the beating that he absorbed in that fight changed him for the rest of his life.

29:22.840 --> 29:26.680
 And also, you know, don't think he'd never been hit before, but it was one of those we go,

29:26.680 --> 29:31.960
 it's, it's all fun and games until you can't remember your name at age 44 years old. And

29:32.760 --> 29:36.360
 I didn't come here, what are they, what did Patton say? Nobody, nobody wins the war by dying

29:36.360 --> 29:41.400
 for his country, make the other poor bastard die for his. And I think that that's kind of what

29:41.400 --> 29:47.880
 we're shooting for. And, you know, the lionization of absorbing damage and that not being a big

29:47.880 --> 29:51.880
 deal. Like you hear that all the time, so and so can take shots that would put a lesser fighter

29:51.880 --> 29:57.160
 down. What does that even mean? You know, like, so make it this straight, your ability to absorb

29:57.160 --> 30:01.080
 damage is a part of you. I mean, I guess that don't get me wrong, that is an attribute that's

30:01.080 --> 30:05.320
 nice to have if you, if you need it. But there's plenty of people that actually have really porous

30:05.320 --> 30:10.920
 defense that are just very, very difficult to hurt for whatever reason. That's a fascinating

30:10.920 --> 30:18.680
 fighter's perspective on the thing. I mean, the, the, the story that is inspiring. And I know

30:18.680 --> 30:26.440
 it goes against the artistry of fighting is when you have taken the damage to still rise up

30:27.160 --> 30:35.080
 and be able to defeat the opponent. So it's a, but that, that's a flip side of a basically

30:35.080 --> 30:40.440
 you failing to defend yourself properly, right? I agree. But let's say for, I think it's a

30:40.440 --> 30:44.920
 triumph, that's a triumph of humanity. That's a triumph. That's amazing to witness such a thing

30:44.920 --> 30:51.800
 is unbelievable. But you still go, this is, there is a cost here. It's like, I've been fortunate

30:51.800 --> 30:56.040
 enough to spend some time working with, with the military. And I've been like around and read

30:56.040 --> 30:59.160
 Medal of Honor citations, they're unbelievable. Like you read the story and you're like,

30:59.160 --> 31:03.160
 it's, it'll floor you. But it's a little cost and you don't want to be paying that cost

31:03.160 --> 31:07.400
 all along. And most of the time with the cost was everything. And then sometimes you go, hey,

31:07.400 --> 31:12.600
 yeah, the value here, it's worth everything. It's like, I defend your family, defend your

31:12.600 --> 31:16.280
 country under certain circumstances. And if that points extension of your family, you're like,

31:16.280 --> 31:20.600
 Hey, this is worth it to casually throw your life away or throw your health. It's foolish.

31:20.600 --> 31:24.360
 There's nothing, there's nothing great about that. And, and like you said, it's still an amazing

31:24.360 --> 31:30.280
 thing to see. But, but it's also amazing to see you not take damage as the Floyd Mayweather.

31:30.280 --> 31:33.720
 It's the artistry of like not being hit. And I wonder if maybe that's why people don't

31:33.720 --> 31:37.800
 resonate with Floyd as much as obviously Muhammad Ali was such a time and place a great man for

31:37.800 --> 31:41.320
 so many different reasons. Although it was funny to remember like there were times when he wasn't

31:41.320 --> 31:45.400
 very popular, we love him now because of time of context, you know, the time to move away from

31:45.400 --> 31:50.600
 some of the nonsense he had to deal with. But we got to see him struggle. And also he had

31:50.600 --> 31:55.160
 unbelievable sacrifice both in and out of the ring, you know, that, that we all got to witness.

31:55.720 --> 31:59.400
 We've never really seen Floyd struggle like that. And granted, obviously Floyd isn't like a

31:59.400 --> 32:03.000
 civil rights figure like Muhammad Ali was is different time, different place and he's a

32:03.000 --> 32:08.120
 different man. But basically, you know, I wonder if part of the thing that made us it made everyone

32:08.120 --> 32:11.560
 think of Muhammad Ali as the greatest in addition to, of course, the unbelievable things that he

32:11.560 --> 32:17.560
 did out in the world and the stands that he made, we saw him struggle in the ring. It's,

32:17.560 --> 32:22.840
 it's almost it's humanizing, you know, it's, it's weird when people respect Khabib. But again,

32:22.840 --> 32:29.560
 it's we saw GSP lose and GSP came back stronger. Khabib is amazing. But I wonder, I wonder how

32:29.560 --> 32:33.560
 people feel about him long term, not like they won't think of him as amazing and great. And he's

32:33.560 --> 32:40.760
 been a respectable person and champion. But the time he hasn't, he hasn't had to fall, if that

32:40.760 --> 32:49.480
 makes sense. And also coupled with Ali had a way of being poetic about sort of the way he was in

32:49.480 --> 32:53.160
 the ring, sort of being able to explain the artistry that he's, I mean, there's like joking

32:53.160 --> 32:59.400
 as being playful, but really he was able to describe the flow like a butterfly thing like it

32:59.400 --> 33:05.800
 could be, like he was able to actually talk about his strategy without talking, without crossing

33:05.800 --> 33:10.680
 that line into the flow he made, whether when you're just talking about money and just talking

33:10.680 --> 33:15.800
 shit. That's true. Actually, Conor McGregor, when he's not talking shit, is pretty good at like

33:15.800 --> 33:21.720
 talking about the art of the martial and like the first one. And I wish Khabib did the same.

33:21.720 --> 33:29.400
 Actually, from like the set you have brothers, there's a few, there's a culture of like being

33:29.400 --> 33:38.600
 poetic about like being scholars and also bards or whatever, the poets of the game. And Khabib is

33:38.600 --> 33:45.240
 more like just simple and he lets his actions speak, which is great too. It's poetic in its own

33:45.240 --> 33:51.400
 way. Yeah, it's great, but it's nice when you can tell stories. And you know, that's

33:51.400 --> 33:58.600
 probably why Lee was the great catch me up to you went to three fights, I think undefeated. Yep.

33:59.240 --> 34:04.200
 BJ Penn, you talked about last time you defeated BJ Penn, that's a, that's a, I mean, that's an

34:04.200 --> 34:12.360
 incredible accomplishment. But you fought a lot of really tough guys. When was your last fight and

34:12.360 --> 34:17.240
 then catch me up with the injuries? Well, a lot of people kept more and more and more or

34:17.240 --> 34:22.760
 were unwilling to fight you. Yeah, that's been, that's, that was why I was out for two years

34:22.760 --> 34:28.280
 following the Gray Manor fight between the fighting Gray and BJ. And the Gray Manor fight

34:28.280 --> 34:32.680
 was actually one I'm really proud of because Gray was very tough. He's very big, very strong,

34:32.680 --> 34:38.200
 very experienced. I had only five fights at the time. And I didn't have a lot of skills. I don't

34:38.200 --> 34:43.560
 get to fight Gray with what I have today. I had to fight Gray with what I had in December 2016.

34:43.560 --> 34:48.200
 And that I, it really took a lot of discipline, a lot of focus, a lot of challenge, you know,

34:48.200 --> 34:51.720
 to stay the course, to do what I needed to do in that fight and to win in, in ultimately

34:51.720 --> 34:56.040
 dominating fashion, just not in the dominating obvious sense that you see when someone runs

34:56.040 --> 35:00.920
 across and just does that to somebody. But that wasn't on the list for me at that time, you know.

35:00.920 --> 35:05.560
 So that was a, that was an interesting one. But the time away, again, was very frustrating.

35:05.560 --> 35:09.640
 That was incredibly difficult. Before that fight. After that fight. Well, because I,

35:09.640 --> 35:15.160
 I, I beat Artem Lobov in the final of the Ultimate Fighter and Artem is another guy that's tough,

35:15.160 --> 35:20.440
 a lot of experience and gets, gets, you know, he's, he's a funny guy and he said some things on

35:20.440 --> 35:24.280
 the internet. So he gets a lot of heat for that. But, you know, he just knocked out three of my

35:24.280 --> 35:28.520
 teammates. I'm like, he put a couple of people in a pretty rough shape at the end of that. So he

35:28.520 --> 35:32.440
 was doing well. And that was a tough fight. Again, if I got to go back and fight that fight now,

35:32.440 --> 35:35.960
 it would be not competitive at all. I mean, it wasn't competitive at that time, but it very,

35:35.960 --> 35:39.960
 it was competitive. It wasn't close, but it was competitive. So you were improving and growing

35:39.960 --> 35:44.360
 fast. Yeah. And it was nice to have time away. I wish I'd had more time in the ring, but again,

35:44.360 --> 35:49.320
 I'd only been doing MMA for three years at that time. So the improvement from doing what the

35:49.320 --> 35:56.760
 Bitcoin mining was over, overriding the ring rust. I think so. I don't really believe in ring rust,

35:56.760 --> 36:01.240
 if I'm honest. You know, I can understand why, you know, people could feel a certain way. But

36:01.240 --> 36:05.000
 if anything, it's almost like you just kind of forget what competitions like. And you realize

36:05.000 --> 36:08.440
 like, oh, you feel butterflies or something like that. And you go, oh my God, this is different,

36:08.440 --> 36:11.480
 versus, no, that's just your body getting ready to perform. It's okay. It's normal.

36:11.480 --> 36:16.760
 How do you not have ring rust? I think I try to, I try to practice performing no matter what,

36:16.760 --> 36:20.040
 you know, like whether it's singing karaoke and not very good, but like anything, you name it,

36:20.040 --> 36:25.720
 talking in front of people. You embrace the butterflies? Yeah. It's almost like, I remember

36:25.720 --> 36:30.760
 my last fight, I'm just staring at the wall and I'm like, huh, I guess I'm going to fight in a

36:30.760 --> 36:35.400
 couple of minutes. I mean, of course, we all heard the phrase like, you can never walk in

36:35.400 --> 36:39.160
 the same river twice because even if you're this, even if the river's the same, you're a different

36:39.160 --> 36:43.480
 man. That's, I think it's a really important thing to understand because at various points in my

36:43.480 --> 36:48.440
 martial arts career of thought, oh man, how should I feel? I remember when I used to do well in

36:48.440 --> 36:53.000
 competition, I would feel, I would think these thoughts, listen to this song, think about this,

36:53.000 --> 36:57.560
 I would feel a certain way. And then if you don't feel that way, I would start to become stressed

36:57.560 --> 37:03.000
 because I was self inflicted versus going, you'll feel how you feel. Your job is to show up with

37:03.000 --> 37:07.080
 what you have on the day, do your absolute best. It's like, I will never quit. I can be sure of

37:07.080 --> 37:10.200
 that. I didn't say I can't be beat. I can definitely be beat. I could have lost every

37:10.200 --> 37:15.000
 single fight that I've ever had, but I control my effort and I control my attitude and that's,

37:15.000 --> 37:19.560
 I will do my very best to actually get my game plan and the event's not working. If I have to,

37:19.560 --> 37:23.560
 I'll put my hands up and walk dead forward if I need to at somebody. We hope that that's not

37:23.560 --> 37:28.760
 where it goes. But again, that humanizing moment where you're shooting for the inner,

37:28.760 --> 37:34.280
 like the inner, you sacrifice the outer and all you have left is will and you hope it doesn't

37:34.280 --> 37:38.440
 happen. But if it does, you'll be there. But I guess to come back, the extra periods of time

37:39.400 --> 37:44.440
 in between fights, I think was valuable because it was deeply challenging. It was incredibly,

37:44.440 --> 37:48.200
 it was heartbreaking sometimes, for Moniz, man. It's like, I didn't want to...

37:48.200 --> 37:49.240
 It's just waiting.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.280
 Oh my God, dude.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.880
 Is there politics involved?

37:51.880 --> 37:59.800
 Sometimes, you know, every single time you step into the ring, nothing's guaranteed.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.480
 You could be hurt. You could hurt somebody. You could win. You could lose.

38:06.840 --> 38:10.600
 Throwing away, just like I said, throwing away your health or your life cheaply makes no sense

38:10.600 --> 38:17.720
 for anyone. And having demonstrating some degree of temperance is not cowardly either.

38:17.720 --> 38:23.880
 I mean, but again, if you wait too long, you have nothing. So I guess like I was trying and

38:25.160 --> 38:29.080
 I'm always open to fighting the absolute best people possible. I'm never turning down fights

38:29.080 --> 38:33.560
 ever. You know, if some random jabroni decides that he wants to fight, I'm gonna go away.

38:33.560 --> 38:37.480
 If I wanted to just fight randoms, I would just start at stand on the table at Denny's

38:37.480 --> 38:41.160
 and start yelling and I'm sure it would have some people who'd be willing to indulge me.

38:41.160 --> 38:47.080
 But you want to fight meaningful opponents, challenging opponents, and I know who

38:47.080 --> 38:52.840
 and where they are. You did fight in Atlantic City. But you put the Denny's behind you.

38:52.840 --> 38:57.240
 I did. And I'll be honest, if there were a fight I stood up after that fight, I don't know if I

38:57.240 --> 39:01.160
 was in great shape to expect to win in the other fights that evening, but I could have tried it.

39:01.160 --> 39:03.880
 I'm sure there were some takers in the crowd, particularly after they watched me fight,

39:03.880 --> 39:07.400
 they're like, yeah, I'll fight that guy. Okay. So when was the last fight?

39:07.400 --> 39:11.480
 That was Darren Elkins. That was six months or seven months after the BJ fight, which was great,

39:11.480 --> 39:13.800
 because I love maybe fives. He's a really tough opponent.

39:13.800 --> 39:19.960
 Very tough opponent, very tough guy, super tough dude. And that was in July, 2019. And then right

39:19.960 --> 39:25.320
 when I was about to fight, you were ready to fight regularly after that. You were trying to fight.

39:25.320 --> 39:28.920
 You were trying to find a fight. Yeah, we got Ricardo Lomas. So no one else,

39:28.920 --> 39:34.040
 none of the, I was ranked in the top 15 at that point. And then people didn't want to fight.

39:34.040 --> 39:37.480
 We were struggling to find an opponent. Then Ricardo Lomas, a great, you know,

39:37.480 --> 39:41.240
 former title challenger, you know, MMA, you know, really great history and MMA recently

39:41.240 --> 39:48.520
 retired, but we were supposed to fight in, I think, May, March, May of 2020. And then coronavirus

39:48.520 --> 39:52.840
 happened. And so that scrapped the whole show, you know, training, we were just scrambling to

39:52.840 --> 39:57.880
 try to keep the gym alive and take care, you know, I have five or six full, five, six, I think,

39:57.880 --> 40:01.560
 five full time employees that I, you know, they're my responsibility. I have to,

40:01.560 --> 40:05.800
 their livelihood is in my hands. And it's, they'd be irresponsible of me to,

40:05.800 --> 40:11.960
 to not take that seriously. So anyway, we were able to navigate through that time. And then we

40:11.960 --> 40:16.600
 were able to reschedule the Lomas fight. And that was in August of last year. And I got a,

40:17.320 --> 40:21.800
 a medical like flag, like, Oh, hey, you like, you, you, you have like a medical condition

40:21.800 --> 40:26.920
 that we need to look into. You, when I got pulled from the fight, and this immediately was concerned,

40:26.920 --> 40:30.520
 because of course, any serious medical condition, you want to go, Oh man, well, I guess I would

40:30.520 --> 40:35.400
 like to look at that. Yeah, it turns out it was a giant false positive. And, you know, we find

40:35.400 --> 40:40.120
 that out, you know, all of five weeks later, and you go, you gotta be kidding me. That's frustrating.

40:40.120 --> 40:43.320
 And then we're still waiting for a fight, waiting for a fight, waiting for a fight,

40:43.320 --> 40:47.720
 waiting for a fight, people won't sign up, asked for a number of different opponents,

40:47.720 --> 40:51.480
 basically said, Hey, I'm willing to fight anybody that's, that's tough and moving forward.

40:53.160 --> 40:59.720
 Finally got a, you know, a great opponent in Danny Gay for, I guess it would have been this,

40:59.720 --> 41:05.880
 this March. And then I was training in January, working on, working on some stuff. I was out

41:05.880 --> 41:11.400
 training with Raymond Daniels in, in California, Raymond's amazing, unbelievable, you know,

41:11.400 --> 41:15.800
 kickboxing karate style kickboxer, fantastic martial artist, great teacher, great training

41:15.800 --> 41:20.280
 partner and good friend. And, you know, just really bad luck, you know, kind of a fall in the

41:20.280 --> 41:26.280
 middle of, in the middle of training. And I tore my hip flexor halfway off of my femur. So that

41:26.280 --> 41:29.880
 wasn't great. And you go like, man, right at the time where you're like, Oh man, all right,

41:29.880 --> 41:33.720
 finally moving forward, you know, having the opportunity to fight, Dan's a really tough guy,

41:33.720 --> 41:36.600
 you know, you have to fight well, if you want to have a good chance to do well with him, if you

41:36.600 --> 41:39.320
 don't fight well, it's going to be a rough night. And like, that's exactly what I signed up for,

41:39.320 --> 41:43.960
 that's what we want, BJ, that's what we want with the Elkins, that was gray. And then the universe

41:43.960 --> 41:48.920
 goes, Hey, man, I hear you, but there's also this. So anyway, fortunately, it's healing up. And then

41:48.920 --> 41:54.600
 hopefully, when do you think you, you know, from May, I think, made this year, May of this year.

41:54.600 --> 41:58.440
 Yeah. So it's been, it's been, it's been about five weeks since the injury.

41:58.440 --> 42:01.800
 You'd be able to heal up, do you think? Yeah, I think it'll be okay by then. Like,

42:01.800 --> 42:07.160
 I don't need a big camp at this point. I've had years of camp, not going to curtail my drinking

42:07.160 --> 42:10.600
 or anything like that. Obviously, you know, come on, man, life is meant to be lived. And,

42:11.160 --> 42:15.800
 you know, so it's, you know, I've, I've, I'm in good shape. I always, I'm always training. I'm

42:15.800 --> 42:19.240
 trying to do my best to train around the injury to the extent that I can right now without,

42:19.240 --> 42:23.720
 you know, hurting myself long term. So is there a particular opponents you're thinking about?

42:23.720 --> 42:27.960
 Yeah, anybody, anybody forward? You know, I mean, I tried to, I asked, I asked the second

42:27.960 --> 42:31.400
 that I got hurt, I sent a message to Dan and I said, Hey, man, like, I just wanted you to be

42:31.400 --> 42:37.320
 the first person to know. I, you know, I just was pretty reasonably injured. We just got an MRI,

42:37.320 --> 42:41.320
 doctor says like, Hey, man, you're out and you need to take like three weeks off, off, don't do

42:41.320 --> 42:44.120
 anything, or you're going to, you're going to tear it the whole way. And this is going to be

42:44.120 --> 42:48.200
 surgery. And then it's going to be an additional like eight weeks on top of that to start to rehab

42:48.200 --> 42:53.080
 it through PT. And anyway, you know, so I let him know, Hey, if you can push this thing back,

42:53.080 --> 42:57.000
 I would love to keep on the car or love to keep the fight. You know, it's like I respect you a

42:57.000 --> 43:00.920
 lot as an opponent. And also it's been brutal trying to get anybody to sign on. So if you're

43:00.920 --> 43:04.840
 into it, I'm still there. Unfortunately, he turned that down. I understand he had other

43:04.840 --> 43:09.240
 things going on and he and his wife are expecting a child coming up. So he needed to, he needed

43:09.240 --> 43:14.840
 to fight. And anyway, you know, I guess what we'll see is coming forward. Is there somebody's like

43:14.840 --> 43:21.560
 super tough in the featherweight division that you, you seem to like enjoy the difficult puzzles?

43:21.560 --> 43:25.320
 Is there somebody especially difficult that you would like to fight?

43:25.320 --> 43:31.160
 I would like to fight. I know that I'll need to win at least one fight before this. And I look

43:31.160 --> 43:35.480
 forward to coming back and giving my best effort to do that. I want to fight to beat

43:35.480 --> 43:43.000
 Megaman Sharapov. I want to fight Yaya Rodriguez. I want to fight Korean zombie. And it's complicated,

43:43.000 --> 43:47.960
 man. Yeah, that would be fun. I would love to see that fight. That's a fascinating fight.

43:47.960 --> 43:52.680
 That would be fun. He would be very challenging. All those guys are very challenging. And so I

43:52.680 --> 43:56.840
 look forward to just staying healthy to the extent that we can coming back. And I'm going to fight

43:56.840 --> 44:03.800
 multiple times this year. Heller, hot water. Hell yes. Hey, by the way, I completely forgot

44:03.800 --> 44:08.760
 because you were talking about the systems and decision trees and the illusion of choice

44:08.760 --> 44:14.120
 made me think of Sam Harris. And I forgot to mention it. So he talks about free will quite a

44:14.120 --> 44:20.040
 bit and that there's an illusion of free will. Bull claim cotton.

44:21.720 --> 44:28.040
 That maybe the universe constructed that little game where it makes us feel like we have a bunch

44:28.040 --> 44:32.920
 of choices, but we really don't. We're really always ending up with a middle finger. That would

44:32.920 --> 44:39.000
 be hilarious. Yeah. That's what you see before you die. Just a giant middle finger. It's like,

44:39.000 --> 44:44.680
 oh, fuck. I knew it. I knew it. What do you think? Do you think there's a free will? Like, we feel

44:44.680 --> 44:49.160
 like we're making choices. So you're thinking, again, what we're talking about, okay, here's a

44:49.160 --> 44:55.720
 system of martial arts that's hands of grace. There's different schools and whatever. And then

44:55.720 --> 45:00.120
 you're thinking, okay, how can I think outside these systems? But then there's also a system that's

45:00.120 --> 45:09.880
 our human society. And we feel like there's an actual choice being made by us individuals.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.720
 Do you think that choice is real? Or is it just an illusion?

45:13.720 --> 45:17.240
 Well, okay, that's a really good question. I'm not necessarily equipped to answer this,

45:17.240 --> 45:22.280
 but I'll do my best. Okay, I guess I would say to start with, sure, we'll be interesting if it

45:22.280 --> 45:27.400
 wasn't real. If the choice wasn't real, we'll be pretty interesting if it is real. First off,

45:27.400 --> 45:32.760
 I would start with facilitated beliefs versus not facilitated beliefs. It's almost like,

45:32.760 --> 45:38.840
 I think the world's out to get me. True, not true. What next? Probably not a

45:38.840 --> 45:46.680
 facilitated belief. Imagine you believe there's no free will. Okay, now what? Does that justify

45:46.680 --> 45:51.560
 every single impulse that you're going to give into? Or does the belief in free will,

45:51.560 --> 45:57.080
 does the belief in my ability to work hard, to focus, to be disciplined, to improve my position,

45:57.080 --> 46:01.880
 improve my situation, whether it's true or not, although I think that at least many of us would

46:01.880 --> 46:06.360
 argue that at least whether there's some sort of internal driver that allows for that.

46:07.880 --> 46:11.960
 We live in a material world. Your actions do affect the world. I can choose to pick that

46:11.960 --> 46:19.960
 water up or not. And anyway, I would say a belief strongly in the idea of picking facilitated beliefs

46:21.480 --> 46:26.760
 and going, hey, I will adjust. Whether this belief system is right or wrong on a cosmic level,

46:26.760 --> 46:32.840
 I'm nowhere near smart enough to understand. But I can say me deciding that, let's say,

46:32.840 --> 46:35.960
 for instance, I'm going to walk over to have a conversation with someone in a hotel lobby

46:35.960 --> 46:40.840
 and I've never met them and I go over and I start with, this is going to be interesting and I just

46:40.840 --> 46:46.280
 walk over there versus in my head, I'm like, what's this asshole want? We're about to have two very

46:46.280 --> 46:51.480
 different conversations. I could be right that this person's not very polite or thinks negatively

46:51.480 --> 46:57.000
 of me right from go, but I think that that's probably not a facility to believe people talk about.

46:57.800 --> 47:02.520
 How is that going to help me navigate the conversation to a positive conclusion? And I

47:02.520 --> 47:08.520
 think about that for, let's say fighting, it's a good example, like confidence. Plenty of people

47:08.520 --> 47:14.040
 believe plenty of things that aren't real. Myself included, I'm sure, all the time. And anyway,

47:14.040 --> 47:18.200
 believing that you can do something, I'm like, hey, I think I can win. Doesn't guarantee you a

47:18.200 --> 47:23.160
 positive outcome, but I would say most of us would probably, most of us would argue that it helps.

47:25.000 --> 47:32.360
 What's depression if not a negative, unfacilitated belief that oftentimes is not

47:32.360 --> 47:37.000
 reflected by reality, but you project it onto reality and it's understandable if it makes

47:37.000 --> 47:40.680
 you feel like, oh man, this isn't going to work out. I don't think the prospects are going well.

47:40.680 --> 47:45.000
 And then if you feel like you can't get out of that loop, that seems pretty rough. And I see a lot

47:45.000 --> 47:49.400
 of things out in society right now where you go, whether you agree or disagree with various positions

47:49.400 --> 47:54.440
 on things, you go, is that a facilitator belief? Even if that is true, which is arguable, anything.

47:55.320 --> 48:00.280
 So what next, man? So where does this end? One is the positive. What's the happy ending here? And

48:00.280 --> 48:04.920
 if they go, well, there is no happy ending, I'm like, okay, so now what? So what do we do here?

48:06.120 --> 48:12.600
 So choose the facilitator belief. And in your intuition, believing that free will is real

48:12.600 --> 48:19.480
 is more productive for a successful life. Absolutely. Because otherwise, how am I not...

48:21.400 --> 48:27.800
 First of, how can society function if it's not real? So how can I blame you or anyone else or

48:27.800 --> 48:32.840
 hold anyone responsible for anything if free will isn't real? No, that's exactly the point.

48:34.120 --> 48:40.040
 But at the surface level, what you're saying is true. But perhaps if we truly internalize

48:40.040 --> 48:43.800
 that free will is an illusion, we'll start to figure out something that

48:45.800 --> 48:51.000
 transforms the way we see society. For example, we are very individual centric.

48:51.000 --> 48:58.760
 So believing that free will is real puts a lot of responsibility and blame on people when they

48:59.400 --> 49:06.360
 do something bad. Maybe if we truly internalize that free will is an illusion, we start to think

49:06.360 --> 49:15.160
 about the system of humans together as this mechanism for progress as opposed to where

49:15.160 --> 49:22.760
 individual people are responsible for their actions, good or bad. So we remove the value,

49:22.760 --> 49:29.160
 the weight we assign to the accomplishments or the violence, the negative stuff done by

49:29.160 --> 49:33.080
 individuals and more look at the progress of society. I don't know what that looks like,

49:33.080 --> 49:37.560
 but it's almost like as opposed to focusing on the individual ants of an ant colony

49:37.560 --> 49:39.800
 looking at the entirety of the ant colony.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.600
 So that makes perfect sense. I would just say that that's a reasonable thing to suggest.

49:44.600 --> 49:49.000
 It's a seismic shift, right? And it's hard to say whether that would be better or worse,

49:49.000 --> 49:54.520
 but I guess I'll use this as a convenient one for me. So I remember the last time we spoke,

49:54.520 --> 49:59.240
 I brought up one of the most reviled evil characters in certainly recent history,

49:59.240 --> 50:04.040
 probably human history period Adolf Hitler. Well, I'm a big fan of making people live in

50:04.040 --> 50:08.920
 the world that they want to believe in. Well, if free will doesn't exist and it's just about

50:08.920 --> 50:13.960
 how things move forward, when are we going to be high fiving this guy or what? Because I remember

50:13.960 --> 50:17.080
 what I said and that actually brings me to something else we discussed.

50:18.440 --> 50:24.360
 Yeah, for people who don't know, Ryan brought up, or I brought up, there's literally a giant book

50:24.360 --> 50:30.760
 about Hitler. So I've been obsessed with Hitler World War II installing recently for recently.

50:32.840 --> 50:37.720
 Oh man, this has become like a meme. Joe Rogan with like DMT and me with Hitler.

50:37.720 --> 50:41.880
 Can that make something more positive? Like Cat in the Hat or something? I don't know.

50:41.880 --> 50:45.320
 But you brought up Hitler as an example of something particular,

50:45.320 --> 50:54.600
 of some philosophical discussions we're having. And the excellent, eloquent, and the full of

50:54.600 --> 51:01.560
 integrity MMA journalist clipped out something you've said about Hitler and said that,

51:03.160 --> 51:08.280
 you know, I forget what the headlines are, but they were the most ridiculous possible

51:08.280 --> 51:14.360
 implementation. Basically, it's intentionally misunderstanding what I'm saying. Then it's

51:14.360 --> 51:18.280
 like, I get that they're stupid, but I'm stupid too. So I know what that's like. So I don't have

51:18.280 --> 51:23.800
 a lot of sympathy for you. Yeah, exactly. I can't give you a pass on that. But basically,

51:23.800 --> 51:30.440
 intentionally misunderstanding what's going on. But what I find funny is that, hey, we got to

51:30.440 --> 51:34.600
 be careful what we believe. And again, back to the cancel culture thing that we discussed last

51:34.600 --> 51:39.080
 time as well, where would I like to apologize? I mean, no, actually something about cancel

51:39.080 --> 51:43.160
 culture that we've been seeing things culturally. I'm like, I will be damned if I apologize for

51:43.160 --> 51:46.520
 anything that I don't need to apologize for, because I was intentionally misunderstood in

51:46.520 --> 51:51.560
 that instance. Now, you could say that I'm not a historical scholar, which I would agree immediately.

51:51.560 --> 51:56.360
 And also that I oftentimes in eloquently or in articulately phrase things, which I'll agree

51:56.360 --> 52:01.400
 that what is again, but ultimately, you know, going, hey, I want to make you believe live in

52:01.400 --> 52:07.320
 the world that you're suggesting ought to exist. Okay, so if there's no free will,

52:07.320 --> 52:13.160
 is everything, how far of a step back are we willing to take cosmically before we start going,

52:13.160 --> 52:18.360
 hey, this is good, because we're experiencing a social, you know, reckoning in our country at the

52:18.360 --> 52:25.320
 moment, you know, for good and for other, probably, I guess. And basically, but hey, it all worked

52:25.320 --> 52:31.000
 out, right? So that's probably not something that would fly. And I think that's a fair thing.

52:31.000 --> 52:35.480
 That's interesting. It might not fly from the individual perspective, but if you zoom out,

52:35.480 --> 52:42.360
 but if you zoom out, and think that, you know, appreciate society as, you know, just like an

52:42.360 --> 52:49.160
 ant colony as a beautifully complex system, like we kind of, from the individual perspective,

52:49.160 --> 52:54.760
 we value progress, especially progress of the individual, but in whole progress of societies.

52:54.760 --> 52:59.640
 But if you accept that this is just a complex system that's not necessarily headed anywhere,

52:59.640 --> 53:06.280
 that this is almost like that river is just flowing, I think that removes the burden of

53:06.280 --> 53:12.520
 always striving, of always trying, of always like the struggle and so on. So it's possible that if

53:12.520 --> 53:18.040
 we have no control, you can like arrive at some kind of other Zen state. Does that sound very human,

53:18.040 --> 53:29.880
 though? That goes against, I think, our current human condition as we experience it, but we've

53:29.880 --> 53:34.920
 communicated that to each other. Like we've taught, like through these social forces taught

53:34.920 --> 53:42.600
 each other that our lives matter and so on. Maybe if we convince ourselves that we're just sort of

53:42.600 --> 53:48.200
 like little things in a stream and ultimately none of it matters, there might be some kind of

53:48.200 --> 53:52.840
 enjoyment to be discovered through that process. I don't, listen, I'm a capitalist, rah rah, like...

53:53.960 --> 53:57.480
 But I guess I think you're bringing up a really important point. I guess almost anything like

53:57.480 --> 54:03.160
 capitalism, I only get to experience it as I sit here now and I get to live, I was raised in the

54:03.160 --> 54:06.840
 United States, have traveled around the world a little bit, have had the, you know, good fortune

54:06.840 --> 54:13.160
 of meeting many people from many different places. And I'm an end user of capitalism. I don't really

54:13.160 --> 54:17.240
 know how it got here, whether it was... I wasn't there at the start of this idea. I wasn't there

54:17.240 --> 54:20.600
 for, hey, how did we come up with this idea? How did we arrive? And I'm nowhere near well read

54:20.600 --> 54:26.680
 enough to understand any of that really even secondhand. And I guess recognizing that

54:26.680 --> 54:32.360
 communism, Marxism, socialism, anarchism, anything is... These are all perspectives that

54:32.360 --> 54:37.560
 all have, I guess, various strengths and weaknesses. But I guess one thing I'm always,

54:37.560 --> 54:41.000
 I guess I would say the burden, it seems to me that if you want to make a change,

54:42.120 --> 54:48.520
 the burden of proof is on the person implying that there needs to be a change. And it doesn't mean

54:48.520 --> 54:52.200
 that there's nothing there, but it's like, if you want to create a small shift, a riffle, that's

54:52.200 --> 54:57.160
 fine, but a seismic ripping shift in how we exist or how we experience the world as human beings.

54:57.160 --> 55:03.560
 And you mentioned fighting, why watching someone undergo, take abuse on a level in the ring that's

55:03.560 --> 55:09.560
 just shocking and then triumph in spite of it. It's like, this is unbelievable. This is part

55:09.560 --> 55:13.880
 of the magic of combat sports. Now, it's part of the magic, the other side of the magic that

55:13.880 --> 55:18.840
 doesn't get talked about sometimes is that the trajectory of that individual's life later on

55:18.840 --> 55:26.200
 is not always great. Or there's, I'm afraid there's a cost for that. But if we remember,

55:26.200 --> 55:33.400
 you mentioned removing the struggle. Personally, the struggle is what makes life life. And also,

55:33.400 --> 55:38.520
 I guess something Faraz has brought up to me on a number of occasions, and it makes sense to me,

55:38.520 --> 55:44.440
 it's basically humans only understand things through relative comparison. I only understand

55:46.120 --> 55:50.520
 heat because I've known cold. I only understand, I guess it's like talking to someone that's

55:50.520 --> 55:55.480
 never experienced any sort of hardship, and then their latte isn't right, and then they pitch a

55:55.480 --> 56:00.280
 fit versus someone that's gone through a great deal of challenge, struggle in their life.

56:01.000 --> 56:06.040
 They tend to have a little bit more of an even perspective. And anyway, and of course, even

56:06.040 --> 56:09.960
 as a relative thing, and what I proceed to be even may not be even, maybe I'm particularly

56:09.960 --> 56:13.400
 softer or something in the other direction without realizing because I can only understand what I

56:13.400 --> 56:20.200
 can understand. But the idea that we want to fundamentally alter ourselves as a species and

56:20.200 --> 56:26.440
 as people seems like an incredibly, incredibly high bar to prove and also like an incredibly

56:26.440 --> 56:30.920
 dangerous idea, because it always comes back to, well, who's going to be responsible for this?

56:30.920 --> 56:34.760
 Who gets to do the choosing? What's a good idea? What's not a good idea? And I guess that actually

56:34.760 --> 56:40.360
 brings me to something I've been encountering recently in discussions with friends. I feel

56:40.360 --> 56:47.080
 like there's only two types of people that I encounter at this point. People with a more or

56:47.080 --> 56:52.040
 less libertarian tilt to their thinking and people without it. And when I say libertarian,

56:52.040 --> 56:55.880
 I don't mean that in the political party sense or even the belief system basic where I'm like,

56:55.880 --> 57:01.800
 hey, you do you buddy. What you're up to is not my concern versus what you're up to is my concern.

57:01.800 --> 57:05.880
 And I guess I've always watched various points in history, people on this side or people on that

57:05.880 --> 57:11.640
 side or more or less, I guess problematic, I guess you could say, and I don't mean that in the

57:11.640 --> 57:18.760
 internet sense, you know, more of an issue. But the world is always full of people that want to

57:18.760 --> 57:23.320
 tell you what you need to be doing as opposed to more or less doing a harm. And I guess that's

57:23.320 --> 57:27.960
 one of the ones anytime I'm trying to tell other people what to do, I better hope I'm right. And

57:27.960 --> 57:33.160
 it's bizarre to me how many people are so confident that their side or their position is the one that's

57:33.160 --> 57:37.080
 not only right for them, but right enough that they can enforce it on others. And that just seems

57:37.080 --> 57:42.520
 incredibly dangerous to me. And I guess that comes back to even Sam's point about, oh, we want to,

57:43.480 --> 57:47.160
 trying to spread the idea that free will doesn't exist. I'm not saying it's damaging,

57:47.160 --> 57:50.840
 but if there will maybe, and plenty of other things could be as well, I'm not, you know,

57:50.840 --> 57:54.120
 it goes way over my head as to, you know, the implications of all of these. And I guess all

57:54.120 --> 58:01.000
 of us are in evangelists for something. But I guess it's weird that we've gotten this far as a

58:01.000 --> 58:06.440
 species. And now we want to take like sharp, sharp turns. Well, we've been taking a bunch of sharp

58:06.440 --> 58:11.800
 turns throughout history. Yeah, that's, that's what, you know, that's, that's a way, you know,

58:11.800 --> 58:17.080
 okay, humans love power. And one way to attain power is to say everything that you guys are

58:17.080 --> 58:21.800
 doing is wrong. And I have the right thing. And I'm going to build up a giant cult of people.

58:21.800 --> 58:27.160
 And I'm going to overthrow and indirectly what that results in me is me gaining power. And

58:27.160 --> 58:33.240
 that's how you get all the big revolutions in human history, saying I'm done with the thing that

58:33.240 --> 58:38.600
 the powerful are currently doing. So I'm going to overthrow that's, that's where probably all

58:38.600 --> 58:43.640
 the identity politics that's happening now is people that didn't have power before are looking

58:43.640 --> 58:49.640
 to gain power. And they're also, you know, that's where Jordan Peterson criticizes identity politics

58:49.640 --> 58:58.680
 is people with the right with a good intentions, I should say, are in seeking power, allow power to

58:58.680 --> 59:07.240
 corrupt them, as power always does. And so they lose track of like the, the, the devils that

59:07.240 --> 59:13.640
 they're fighting by becoming the same kind of devils, the same kind of evil that they're fighting.

59:13.640 --> 59:19.320
 And so that that's just the progress of human history. But hopefully, as these power greedy,

59:19.880 --> 59:25.480
 people keep attaining power with the, with a progressive mindset, over time, things get

59:25.480 --> 59:31.480
 better and better as they, as they have each generation, a lot of, a lot of unfairness happens,

59:31.480 --> 59:39.640
 a lot of hypocrisy happens, a lot of people are trampled along the way by those who mean well.

59:40.520 --> 59:46.280
 But over time, like lessons are learned or like human, like civilization accumulates lessons.

59:46.280 --> 59:51.400
 And in part learns lessons of history, and it gets better and better over time, even though

59:51.400 --> 59:55.880
 in the short term, there's people acting not their best selves. And, you know,

59:58.440 --> 1:00:03.800
 that seems to be the progress of human history, the idea of internalizing with free will not

1:00:03.800 --> 1:00:08.680
 being real. And you're actually making me realize that that ultimately leads to a kind of,

1:00:10.840 --> 1:00:15.880
 does it go in a nihilistic direction? Yeah, it's both nihilistic, or if you want to make it a

1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:21.960
 political system, then it's more like communist type of a system where like the value of the

1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:28.680
 individuals completely reduced, removed, or another perspective is like the freedom

1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:35.160
 of an individual is not to be valued or protected. And so from our current perspective,

1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:38.760
 the systems that seem to have worked, the United States works pretty damn well,

1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:45.480
 despite all the different criticisms, it seems like freedom of the individual in all its forms seems

1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:52.200
 to be fundamental to the success of the United States. And so we should, it's, however the hell

1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:59.000
 you put it, is like, doesn't matter whether free will is or isn't an illusion, the belief that

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:03.480
 it's real. Protects the individual from the group, which is fundamentally correct me if I'm wrong,

1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:07.320
 that always seems like the big issue of history. Hey, there's more of me than there is of you.

1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:13.080
 There is a view, deal with it. You're like, yikes. And you want to be yourself, you want to be

1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:16.040
 different, you want to have a different religion, you want to be a different skin color, you want

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:21.160
 to do this, all the bad tribal things happen when there's more of me than you, correct me if I'm

1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:25.480
 wrong. Yeah, absolutely. And that's always the fundamental power imbalance though, right?

1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:30.360
 What's the interesting thing about libertarian thinking, I guess, I don't know, those words

1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:34.600
 are really... Maybe they're all charged, I know. And I may not scale up, but I mean,

1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:37.720
 more like on a philosophical underpinning where you're like, yeah, basically, hey,

1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:43.560
 you feel free to believe I'm a fool and I'm plenty of people do, I'm sure. But as long as you don't

1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:48.120
 chase me down the hall and hit me in the back of the head with a textbook, what's the big deal?

1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:54.440
 Yeah. So the libertarian viewpoint, which I probably espouse, I'm very much like

1:01:56.120 --> 1:02:01.240
 freedom with the individual is very valuable and leave others the fuck alone unless they're

1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:08.040
 trying to hurt you. The thing is, you also have to, I believe, put in the work of empathy of

1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:14.760
 understanding what others, what leaving people the fuck alone means to others.

1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:19.160
 But isn't that an interesting thing? If I believe in freedom of the individual and I take that,

1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:22.840
 like all of these, like you said, you take them past just their first why question,

1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:28.280
 you ask why, why, why, why, or how, how, how, how many times should that not extend to respect for

1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:32.840
 you, respect for your position, respect for your individual lived experience, which could be

1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:37.640
 grossly different than mine. Yeah. This is the problem with saying, I'm an individual,

1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:43.080
 I'm not going to bother you, you don't bother me. That's just like, that's not actionable.

1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:47.560
 Because to be, to make it actionable, you have to think the why, why, why, why, why,

1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:51.720
 you have to do the steps beyond. You think, what does that actually mean? That means

1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:59.720
 understanding how even my very existence hurts others. Because you have to understand that,

1:03:00.360 --> 1:03:05.960
 you're not just sitting alone in a room, you're using public transit, using the police force,

1:03:05.960 --> 1:03:12.040
 you're using firefighters, you're using a lot of resources that are publicly shared,

1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:21.320
 and some of those resources are unfairly distributed. We've agreed that we're going to pay taxes,

1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:26.440
 and those taxes are going to go towards building some kind of infrastructure. So that's already

1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:31.800
 towards social, that's, so you're not a real, you're not a real sort of like talk to Michael

1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:37.080
 Malis, like anarchists, right? Saying like basically full, just leave me the fuck alone,

1:03:37.080 --> 1:03:42.920
 and I'm going to collaborate with whoever the hell I want. That's not the American society

1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:50.360
 as it stands currently. We've agreed that there's going to be certain social institutions that we

1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:58.440
 pay into. And some of the sort of discussions about race and all those kinds of things is about

1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:05.480
 those institutions being institutionally unfair, whether it's race or gender, all those kinds of

1:04:05.480 --> 1:04:11.880
 things. Listen, I have a bunch of criticisms of the way that conversation carries itself out,

1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:19.400
 but the thing is what's valuable is to actually listen and empathize. And that's not often talked

1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:29.320
 about with the leave me the fuck alone mindset, because it doesn't have that little component,

1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:35.720
 which I think could be fundamental to the function of a society, which is like social. Like, what

1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:41.640
 is it though, Obama, you didn't build it, or you didn't build it alone or whatever, however that

1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:46.600
 goes. But basically, we wouldn't be able to accomplish anything as individuals without the

1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:55.240
 help of others. And to be able to then start to think, okay, so what is my duty, what is my

1:04:55.240 --> 1:05:01.400
 responsibility to other human beings to be respectful, to be loving, to help them as part

1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:05.640
 of this functioning society? That starts, that's actually a lot of work to start to think about

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:10.360
 that. Because then I have to like think, okay, Ryan, what's his life like? Like as a business owner

1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:17.080
 doing COVID, what's that like? And then he has the employees that run the gym. What's that like?

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:20.920
 What's that stress like? Or about the fighting and the injury and so on? What's that like?

1:05:20.920 --> 1:05:26.680
 That empathy takes a lot of like compute cycles. And also a lot of energy, right?

1:05:26.680 --> 1:05:35.160
 But I have to go through that computation. If I want to be an individual that's like doesn't hurt

1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:39.960
 you. If I may, I guess like to come back to Muhammad Ali, one of the things he said is service

1:05:39.960 --> 1:05:47.720
 to others is the rent that you pay for your rent here on earth. And now one of the things that I

1:05:47.720 --> 1:05:52.920
 think that I see as a result of the internet all the time is people talking about global giant

1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:59.800
 problems, social problems that are society wide that are massive, truly massive and frankly,

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:06.040
 beyond the power of any of us to solve. It's certainly on an individual level.

1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:10.040
 So I've discussed things with friends, like my father's an environmental attorney,

1:06:10.040 --> 1:06:15.720
 like has been for a long time and has been an engineer for a long time. And so I'm not

1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:21.240
 barely know anything, but I'm read in a little bit of various things. But climate change,

1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:25.160
 oh my god, I'm so concerned about climate change. What am I supposed to do about climate change?

1:06:25.160 --> 1:06:30.280
 I'll tell you what I can do is I can not litter. I can try to conserve energy where I can. I can

1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:38.440
 do whatever I want. What can I personally do about some giant social problem that I didn't start and

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.160
 is out of my control? I'm like, well, I can be decent to the people around me. I can mention,

1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:47.560
 I can demonstrate empathy and I can demonstrate consideration for the people in my circle.

1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:52.120
 And to the extent that I can the people outside of my circle, but yelling at the trees over

1:06:52.120 --> 1:06:57.320
 things that over problems that are borderline cosmic doesn't seem very productive. It just

1:06:57.320 --> 1:07:01.400
 makes me feel like I'm cool and important because I'm talking about something well hundreds of years

1:07:01.400 --> 1:07:04.760
 from now the water will rise. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. It's completely over my head.

1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:10.200
 I know nothing. But focusing on the problems that we can actually solve, it comes back to the same

1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:14.520
 thing. I want to win a fight. I would love to win a fight. I can't control that. What I can do

1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:18.120
 is I can control each individual step that I take around the ring and try to make the next

1:07:18.120 --> 1:07:25.240
 correct move. I can't look. It gets people's, they get all excited. I'm trying to keep my

1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:30.360
 language in check, but they get all excited thinking about problems that are like Superman

1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:35.880
 couldn't solve these problems. You could be that powerful and you can't make all of the bad things

1:07:35.880 --> 1:07:41.080
 go away, but you can absolutely change yourself. And I think a lot of the lessons that the good

1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:44.760
 lessons from religion that happen, the good lessons from the great men and women throughout

1:07:44.760 --> 1:07:50.920
 history that we are inspired by that talk about change starting with within and again,

1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:54.120
 treating the people around you decently and treating the people around you decently doesn't

1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:58.120
 even necessarily mean the golden rule. Do unto others as you would like them to do to you. I go,

1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:02.040
 well, maybe what I would like and what this person would like aren't the same thing. Well,

1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:05.000
 how am I going to get to the bottom of that? Because I could be attempting to be decent to

1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:09.720
 this person and by my standard, I am being decent, but maybe I'm missing the mark by theirs.

1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:14.280
 Well, I can't possibly if I just interacted with you, it's like someone talking about some

1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:17.640
 nonsense microaggression. So let me get this straight. I've never met you before. You never

1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:22.920
 met me before and you're interpreting some minor comment that I've made in the least charitable

1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:27.800
 way possible. I'm not saying that you couldn't be annoyed, but your expectation for that level of

1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:34.440
 consideration is you're going to be disappointed a lot. Now, if you're someone that's in your life

1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:37.160
 on a consistent basis, and they're like, hey, I really don't appreciate what you're saying

1:08:37.160 --> 1:08:41.480
 or what you're doing here. Do you realize that this is how I'm perceiving and you go, oh, man,

1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:46.600
 I'm so sorry. Of course, I would hear what you have to say. But I guess trying to recognize that

1:08:47.480 --> 1:08:55.560
 I guess my job is to treat others with dignity in general, but that level of specificity that

1:08:55.560 --> 1:09:01.320
 requires increases as it gets closer to you. And as a person, I have a very finite amount of

1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:08.600
 resources financially, intellectually, emotionally, physically. If I chuck 0.001% of it in every

1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:13.240
 single different direction, what am I doing? It's like when people go, oh, I care deeply about

1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:18.520
 Tibet. Why aren't you over there? Go build a house, man. Get on a plane, go build a house. Oh,

1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:22.520
 you don't want to do that. So really what you want to do is post on Facebook and accept

1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:27.080
 high fives for how much of a good guy you are. I got an idea. Go help somebody in your neighborhood.

1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:32.520
 Go play with some kids. Go be a friend to someone that doesn't have a friend. Read a book. Try to

1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:38.040
 educate yourself. And so I guess to come back, all of these problems aren't solvable on a grand

1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:43.560
 scale, but it's almost like by attempting to address them in our personal lives, we do better.

1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:49.640
 But rather than a giant airing of the grievances on a consistent basis, not that that isn't sometimes

1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:55.080
 necessary and valuable, but after you air your grievances, you go, hey, how about we sort this

1:09:55.080 --> 1:10:00.840
 out? What's the next step? And I guess, again, when we're trying to address it on a giant social

1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:03.880
 level, it just seems unmanageable to me, even if you have the best of intentions.

1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:10.600
 Yeah. I mean, but nevertheless, there's a lot you can do on social networks. I mean, I enjoy

1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:16.120
 tweeting and consuming Twitter. I apply the exact same principle that you just said, which is

1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:24.920
 a free will and discussion, which is like, I approach it in a way that I don't get stuck in

1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:32.040
 this loop that's counterproductive. I try to do things that are productive. And it's just like

1:10:32.040 --> 1:10:37.400
 you said, that's like, what kind of things can I do in this world, whether that's tweeting or

1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:43.400
 building things? Those are low effort tweeting, or actually building businesses or building ideas

1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:48.760
 out as high effort. What can I do that will actually solve problems? And that's the way I

1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:55.400
 approach it. And I do wonder if it's possible to at scale, encourage each other to approach

1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:59.480
 like social media and communication with fellow humans in that way. I don't know.

1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:03.640
 How do you think that would be done? I guess like to improve the quality of discourse, maybe?

1:11:03.640 --> 1:11:06.920
 Like, or even like you said, the empathy or the decency of discourse?

1:11:06.920 --> 1:11:13.960
 I think people should be incentivized and encouraged to do that. I think most of what's

1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:21.800
 we see happening on Twitter and Facebook and so on has to do with very small, very powerful

1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:28.520
 implementation details. It goes down to like, what is the source of the dopamine rush,

1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:35.320
 the like button, the sharing mechanisms, just even small tweaks and those can fix a lot.

1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:41.080
 Really? I believe so. So like a lot of the stuff we see now is the result of just initial

1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:47.640
 implementations of these systems that we didn't anticipate. So the monetization comes from

1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:55.560
 engagement and the tools we have is clicking like and sharing. It was not always obvious.

1:11:55.560 --> 1:11:59.960
 It was not obvious from the beginning. It wasn't obvious while Twitter and Facebook grew

1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:05.000
 that there's a big dopamine rush from getting more followers and likes and shares.

1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:08.920
 So we've gotten addicted to this feeling like how many people are commenting, how many people are

1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:14.680
 saying like a clicking like and so on. So that's that dopamine rush. So we want to say the thing

1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:22.200
 that will get the most likes on mass in society. And then the other thing that was expected is

1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:28.040
 the controversial, the divisive will get the most likes. So it had to do with the initial

1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:33.400
 mechanisms of likes and shares resulting in an outcome that was unpredicted, which is

1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:41.000
 huge amounts of division, irrespective of like any of the basics of human connection that we've

1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:46.120
 actually all come to understand in society is valuable at the individual level, like we're

1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:52.120
 saying. But on mass, what results is like you throw all that out and it's all just divisive

1:12:52.840 --> 1:13:01.640
 at scale discourse. I think it could be fixed by incentivizing personal growth, like

1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:07.320
 incentivizing you to challenge yourself, to grow as an individual, and most importantly,

1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:19.960
 to be happy at the end of the day. So incentivize you feeling good in a way that's long lasting,

1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:25.720
 long term. I think what makes people actually feel good is being kind to others long term.

1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:32.680
 In the short term, what feels good is getting a lot of likes. And I think those are just

1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:38.120
 different incentives that if implemented correctly, you could just build social networks that would

1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:41.640
 do much better. So do you think it comes from a structural perspective? I guess at what point

1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:46.040
 does you mention like you mentioned free will and also you mentioned feeling good and again,

1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:53.640
 working hard. I know that you have the, I guess the, was it a race or? No, the Goggins thing.

1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:59.960
 Yeah. It's four by 40, four by four by 48 challenge where you run four miles every four hours for

1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:06.760
 two days. That's awesome. Yeah, it's a bunch of, it's, the challenge of it isn't just the running,

1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:10.760
 the running is very tough, but it's mostly the sleep deprivation because you're just

1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:14.760
 training every four hours. But it's a struggle, right? And that, but the struggle gives meaning.

1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:19.320
 And ultimately, I guess, so how can we, because you mentioned, like you said, adjusting things on

1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:24.440
 like a, I guess, like a programming level, almost a base programming level so that the interface

1:14:24.440 --> 1:14:29.320
 is different for the user. But at what point does the user have a responsibility to, you know,

1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:35.480
 as a, as a man or a woman or a person to just behave more decently? How can we, I guess, utilize,

1:14:36.040 --> 1:14:41.000
 what can we do? It seems like, you know, we're like our society is so grossly missing like a

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:45.400
 Martin Luther King right now, like the great inspiring characters throughout American history,

1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:50.440
 throughout world history. Where are the great leaders? So leadership is part of it. But I,

1:14:50.440 --> 1:14:53.960
 you know, that's definitely where the great leaders is a very good question. That's,

1:14:53.960 --> 1:14:58.200
 that's more of a question of our political systems, why they're not pushing forward the

1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:05.720
 great leaders. But there's also just the, okay, there's some just basic engineering shit, which is

1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:13.720
 when you and I, when you, Ryan, and I are in a room alone, and we're talking, even if we're

1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:20.280
 strangers, the incentives are for us to get along. Like just when we're together in person,

1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:23.640
 that's what I'm saying. I'm not even saying some kind of, but when you, but when you remove that,

1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:30.040
 when we remove that, the, the, the implementation of, of the, of social networks as they stand

1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:36.280
 right now in the digital space, a very different set of incentives. It's more fun to destroy others,

1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:43.480
 to be shitty to others. And that, and it becomes this loop, endless loop. Like you were saying,

1:15:43.480 --> 1:15:49.400
 that's ultimately destructive and not productive. And I think it has to do with just the interfaces

1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:57.480
 of making it feel good to be nice to others. Because currently it doesn't feel nearly as good

1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:03.720
 to be nice to others on the internet. And it's, it doesn't feel nearly as bad

1:16:03.720 --> 1:16:08.360
 as it does in real life to be shitty to others on the internet. So the incentives are just wrong.

1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:14.200
 I, I think there is a technology solution to this, or at least the solution to improve

1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:19.800
 this, this communication mechanism. It's not obvious how, or a bunch of sort of more detailed ideas,

1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:25.320
 but this is fascinating because I've gotten a chance to talk to Jack Dorsey quite a bit.

1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:34.760
 This is the CEO of Twitter. And he is legitimately has, you know, in this conversation, he would agree

1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:40.120
 with everything. And he's a good human being. And he has a lot of really good ideas how to

1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:45.800
 improve things. The question when you're a captain of a ship, whether even it's a question

1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:50.680
 whether CEO is even a captain, how much can you actually steer that ship once it's gotten large

1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:55.000
 enough? There's so much momentum. There's so many users. There's so many people who are marketing

1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:01.560
 and PR and lawyers. It's very difficult to change things. Is it difficult because of the fallout?

1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:04.440
 Or is it difficult because it's actually like literally out of this power?

1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:11.000
 So power is weird when you have a larger organization. This is why the great leaders,

1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:16.120
 what this, what great leaders do, whether it's presidents or leaders of companies, Steve Jobs,

1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:22.280
 I would argue Musk is that way, is to walk into a room full of people who don't want you to create

1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:31.000
 drama. It's weird, man. When people just kind of want to be nice, the niceness creates momentum.

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:35.080
 And nobody wants to, it's the systems thing. Everybody just behaves in the way they were

1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:40.600
 previously behaving in the way they're supposed to behave. And nobody wants to raise a fuss.

1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:47.480
 It takes a great man or woman leader to step in and say, what we've been doing is bullshit.

1:17:47.480 --> 1:17:54.600
 Okay. You're fired. You're cool. What is it that I'm out? Yeah. I think you have to

1:17:54.600 --> 1:18:00.600
 create constant revolutions within a company that's very, very difficult to do structurally

1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:06.680
 and psychologically is very difficult to do, to be able to sort of, yeah, to constantly

1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:13.240
 challenge the way things have been done in the past. And which is why another way it's often done

1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:18.280
 is a startup, like a small company, basically a small company because really successful and

1:18:18.280 --> 1:18:24.040
 then no longer can turn the ship. So a new startup comes along, a new competitor that then

1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:28.840
 challenges the big ship. And then that starts out the winner. That's like Google came to be,

1:18:28.840 --> 1:18:35.640
 saw Twitter came to be in Facebook and so on. And Apple has, you know, that was the dream

1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:41.400
 of Steve Jobs is it would succeed for many decades, for like centuries. That was the idea

1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:48.040
 that you would keep creating revolutions. And under Steve Jobs, Apple successfully

1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:53.240
 pivoted a bunch of times just like reinvented themselves, which is very difficult to do.

1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:56.120
 Because I mean, at least I don't know if this is accurate because I wouldn't know anything,

1:18:56.120 --> 1:19:01.880
 but I've heard plenty of people complain about Steve Jobs. But in reality, the reason that

1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:05.160
 all of these amazing things were done was because this person was willing to, well,

1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:09.880
 obviously brilliant and then also willing to rattle everyone's cage periodically and say,

1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:14.280
 hey, what's going on is not what we need to be doing. That's a really interesting thing.

1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:20.920
 So he would rattle the cage, but he was also, I don't know if those are intricately connected

1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:26.200
 or always have to be connected, but he would just be a dick. So maybe by my, maybe by his

1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:30.920
 standard, I am lazy and worthless. Well, that's, you see that to you. Is he being a dick though,

1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:34.280
 if by his standard, I mean, like again, it's like everyone's stupid compared to somebody.

1:19:34.280 --> 1:19:39.720
 You know, I guess. So you apparently are able to take that kind of thing is

1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:48.040
 sometimes you just, there's ways to cross the line. And I mean, this is okay.

1:19:48.920 --> 1:19:52.840
 The fascinating thing about being a leader, especially a leader of companies,

1:19:53.560 --> 1:19:59.960
 is it's a people problem. So each individual in a room. So as a leader, you're only really

1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:03.560
 interacting with a small number of people because there are leaders of other smaller groups and so

1:20:03.560 --> 1:20:09.960
 on. But each of those individuals in the room have their own different psychology. Some like

1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:17.080
 to be pushed to the limit. Some, some like like to be screamed at. Some have a heart or very soft

1:20:17.080 --> 1:20:23.800
 spoken and almost afraid to speak. And they have to be, you have to, you have to hear them out.

1:20:23.800 --> 1:20:28.360
 Like there's a, and those, those could be all superstars. We're not, we're not talking about

1:20:28.360 --> 1:20:31.480
 like the C students. We're talking about the eight major students. Well, it's funny that,

1:20:31.480 --> 1:20:35.640
 yeah, but the thing to man, the skill to manage all of those people is completely separate from

1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:40.200
 the skill to innovate something. I mean, not that they're not connected, but it's funny how it's,

1:20:40.200 --> 1:20:44.200
 it's almost like, you know, why do we have shitty, why do we have shitty representatives?

1:20:44.200 --> 1:20:47.960
 Well, I mean, the thing that you do to get elected has nothing to do with governance.

1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:48.440
 Yes.

1:20:48.440 --> 1:20:49.000
 You know, so.

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:53.480
 Well, that's exactly it. But the great leaders have to have both skills. So like you have to have

1:20:53.480 --> 1:20:59.480
 the boldness of, if you look at the great presidents through history, you know,

1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:05.720
 usually it's in a time of crisis is when they step up, but they basically say, okay, stop this

1:21:06.680 --> 1:21:13.480
 old way that Congress works of this bickering of this like compromise bullshit. Here's a huge plan

1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:19.640
 that costs billions of dollars in today's age, trillions of dollars, no extra pork, no extra

1:21:19.640 --> 1:21:25.400
 additions, just like here's a clear plan. We're going to build the best road network

1:21:25.400 --> 1:21:30.360
 the world has ever seen or going to build some huge infrastructure project. We're going to

1:21:30.920 --> 1:21:35.720
 revolutionize internet or we're going to coronavirus. We're going to build the largest

1:21:35.720 --> 1:21:40.040
 like testing facility the world has ever seen in terms of the, we're going to get everybody tested

1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:44.120
 several times a day, all those kinds of things, huge projects and say,

1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:49.640
 fuck all this, the details that everybody's bickering about, we're going to give everybody

1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:56.040
 $2,000, we can give everybody $3,000, like huge projects. And at the same time, so that's the

1:21:56.040 --> 1:22:03.080
 boldness and the leadership and saying, throw out all the bullshit of the past. And at the same time,

1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:08.200
 be able to get in the room with the leaders of both parties or for the powerful individuals

1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:12.360
 and smooth talk the shit out of them in the way they need to be smooth talk to.

1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:16.280
 So like both of those skills, it seems to be when they're combined in one person,

1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:23.160
 that's that creates great leaders. Musk appears to have that Elon. I don't know if Steve Jobs,

1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:29.480
 it's interesting. So the criticism of Steve and a little bit on Elon is he misses some of the human

1:22:30.520 --> 1:22:37.800
 part. But maybe it's impossible to have a really, you have like Sanya Nadal, who's a CEO of Microsoft,

1:22:37.800 --> 1:22:43.080
 you have who's really good on the human side, really, really good on the human side, like

1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:49.880
 everybody loves them. The CEO of Google and Alphabet is also the same way. So like,

1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:54.760
 I don't know if it's possible to have both. You only get so many stat points.

1:22:54.760 --> 1:23:01.960
 Yeah, you only get in this RPG of life. You got very good at jujitsu very fast.

1:23:03.160 --> 1:23:07.480
 So you went, I mean, you told the story of Bluebelt and so on, but you went to Black Belt

1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:12.520
 really quickly, and not just in terms of ranks, but in terms of just skill level.

1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:18.280
 I mean, you didn't go to Black Belt nearly as fast as your skills had developed. You were

1:23:18.280 --> 1:23:24.200
 like doing extremely well at a high level of competition. So you're a good person to ask,

1:23:24.200 --> 1:23:29.480
 how does one get good at jujitsu? We talked about solving problems at the elite level, but

1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:36.200
 when you're a beginner at the martial arts, how do you get good? How much training should you do

1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:41.080
 at the very basic stuff? Like how much training, how much drilling, and then the mental stuff, like

1:23:41.080 --> 1:23:48.040
 where should your mind be? How should you approach it from a mental perspective too?

1:23:48.040 --> 1:23:52.200
 I'll just tell you my perspective on this one. I guess I would say I feel, step one,

1:23:52.200 --> 1:24:00.600
 I feel lucky to have found a good training situation, particularly for the time in where

1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:06.600
 I was at. And I drilled a ton. I drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled.

1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:13.400
 And one thing that's really important to understand, though, is that I was able to,

1:24:13.400 --> 1:24:20.040
 in a relatively brief period of years, go from zero to reasonably good. But I think I probably

1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:27.320
 crammed more hours in those small years than most people did training, let's say, in two or three

1:24:27.320 --> 1:24:33.080
 times the length. So it may not, it may masquerade as something else other than it is, I could say.

1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:36.680
 You have to put in the hours. There's no way around that. I think so.

1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:40.440
 But what did you put in those hours? So when you said drilling, can you break that apart a

1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:43.960
 little bit? What does drilling look like? Is there any recommendations you can make?

1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:49.160
 Absolutely. Step one, I would say your choices matter. One of the really important things that I

1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:52.600
 think we should consider about Jiu Jitsu is that there's a lot of junk in the system right now.

1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:58.200
 It's like Jiu Jitsu is exploded in terms of the number of positions, techniques, strategies,

1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:03.320
 this, that, rule sets. That's really cool on the one hand. On the other hand, there's probably a

1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:09.240
 just metric shit ton of suboptimal things that are out there that are being taught.

1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:14.280
 Myself included, I've taught things that are looking back five years, three years, two years,

1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:17.800
 one year, where I'm like, oh, I would not do it like that anymore. Straight up, sometimes I wouldn't

1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:22.840
 do it like that. Other times, I would literally never do even that particular movement. I don't

1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:29.000
 think the shrimp is a real move. It's a giant spiel and seizure to show in person. But long

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:32.840
 short of it, there's a lot of things that we think of as fundamental that I think that are

1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:39.000
 really pretty negative. And also, you know... That's heresy in Jiu Jitsu, isn't it? The shrimp.

1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:44.840
 Exactly. It's like the holy, we all worship the shrimp. We love the shrimp. We love the shrimp.

1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:50.280
 For people who don't do Jiu Jitsu and you should, the shrimp is you scoot your butt

1:25:50.280 --> 1:25:55.480
 away from your opponent. How would you describe that?

1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:59.480
 It's like a really athletic looking position where you look like someone that's trying to stick

1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:04.680
 their butt out on Instagram. And then you push your hands away and you expose your face. And then

1:26:04.680 --> 1:26:08.200
 you lay on your side because someone told you to do that.

1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:12.600
 And you look like a... Yeah, I guess you look like a shrimp.

1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:16.120
 Yeah. It's like that time that someone really credible told me to drink,

1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:20.840
 unleaded gasoline. And I did it for a while. And then it got to the point in my life where

1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:24.680
 the next best... The thing that I needed to do to really improve my life was stop drinking

1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:31.000
 unleaded gasoline. And I would say that there's a lot of stuff that's in there that step one is like

1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:41.000
 it's junk. It's actual junk. And not only will it waste your time, it will be like an albatross

1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:47.400
 hanging on you because it affects how you think about things going forward. So although it's

1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:53.560
 funny like the operating assumptions that we work under have a huge, huge, huge influence you

1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:57.960
 mentioned like growing up in the United States or this being a capitalist society. Like, all right.

1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:01.320
 Now, of course, I think that I don't really know any different otherwise. And I think that a lot

1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:05.560
 of times people go, oh, communism is better. I'm like, I haven't seen it. I haven't read any books

1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:10.520
 about it being better. But it's possible. I mean, I haven't experienced it much myself either.

1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:15.960
 So I can't dismiss it outright. But I guess I would say it's a fundamentally differing operating

1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:20.680
 system underpinning and all of my choices, all of... If I honestly believed in that thing,

1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:25.960
 many of my choices on a moment by moment, on a day by day and certainly on a lifetime basis

1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:31.880
 would be very different. So I would say that it's tough when you're young in the martial arts.

1:27:31.880 --> 1:27:34.600
 And I mean, all of us are always trying to do our best to learn. But when you're young in the

1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:37.720
 martial arts, you'd always go if you're a reasonable guy. What do they call it? Like

1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:40.520
 Dunning Kruger Amnesia. I can't remember if this is the right one. But basically, you go like, oh,

1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:46.200
 I know what I'm doing here. So I can say that's not right. But then I read a new story about baseball

1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:50.280
 and I don't know anything about baseball. It sounds credible. And it's bullshit. But I can't

1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:52.920
 call bullshit. If you're a reasonable person, you can't call bullshit on things that you don't

1:27:52.920 --> 1:27:56.040
 understand. Even if you suspect it's not right, you're like, well, I've got to reserve judgment.

1:27:56.920 --> 1:28:03.320
 You never, ever, ever set aside your need and also obligation to understand

1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:07.720
 why you were doing what you're doing. And don't ask why once, ask why over and over and over

1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:12.120
 and over about the same thing. Oh, well, I want to shrimp. Why? To make space. Why do I want to

1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:15.560
 make space to get away from the guy? Well, why do I want to get away from him? Well, because he's

1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:18.840
 dangerous. Well, why is he dangerous? And you can oftentimes get down to, wait a minute, I didn't

1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:22.200
 even need to move. Three quarters of the time, you're actually acting in the other person's

1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:25.480
 self interest. And I guess a lot of times I can't, this kind of goes beyond what we can

1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:31.560
 demonstrate here. But I would just say, trying to understand what my base operating assumptions

1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:35.480
 are and consistently reevaluate them, which can be fricking exhausting, frankly, and also

1:28:35.480 --> 1:28:40.600
 constant confidence destroying. But you mentioned that I did pretty well relatively quickly. I

1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:48.360
 started in 2004 and I was at Abu Dhabi ADCC for the first time as an alternate in 2007.

1:28:48.360 --> 1:28:53.640
 I want to match there against the Black Belt World Champion. And frankly, the fact that I was able

1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:56.920
 to beat someone like that was neat. But at the same time, it says a little bit more about

1:28:56.920 --> 1:29:03.880
 what Jiu Jitsu is and some of the issues with it than it does about how cool I am or was because

1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:11.080
 that shouldn't really happen when you think about it. You're like, okay, you're championing at

1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:17.800
 ostensibly a very high level of the sport. You enjoy a three inch, four inch height advantage

1:29:17.800 --> 1:29:23.080
 and a 35 pound weight advantage and you just got beat. Like that should not exist. I'm serious

1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:26.680
 that I'm dead serious that should not exist. If that happens, you're doing it wrong. Is it that

1:29:26.680 --> 1:29:30.680
 I'm doing it right or is it that you're doing it wrong? And there's enough variance in the way

1:29:30.680 --> 1:29:35.400
 that you're doing it that you're allowing me to win. And now I did happen to win that with the

1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:42.280
 50 50 heel hook, which was 50 50. But basically, which was one of the early examples of like,

1:29:42.280 --> 1:29:46.760
 Hey guys, by the way, people can try to hurt your legs. And that was something like we mentioned,

1:29:46.760 --> 1:29:50.520
 John Daner mentioned, like, you know, myself, Dean Lister, a lot of the guys from the Hensel

1:29:50.520 --> 1:29:53.480
 Gracie team that have had amazing success. They've gone and done great things.

1:29:53.480 --> 1:29:59.000
 And Craig Jones in the competitive grappling world, basically taking advantage of being very,

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:03.400
 very good in what they're doing, but also a glaring, glaring, glaring issue with the operating

1:30:03.400 --> 1:30:08.760
 system of Jiu Jitsu, which was, you know, a huge vulnerability in the lower body and not

1:30:08.760 --> 1:30:13.160
 only not attacking it, but having no idea how one does attack it, which means you can't understand

1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:20.360
 how someone will assail you. So anyway, I guess to come back is if in the in the absence of knowing

1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:23.800
 what to do, I try to polish what I've got. So if I've got a knife and I'm like, I don't know how

1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:26.680
 to use them, like, okay, I'm just gonna sharpen the edge and polish it and make sure that when I

1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:31.000
 need to use this dang thing, I'll be able to do it. Because trying to put together a system

1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:36.200
 when you don't have an idea of what's going on, a lot of times you end up making, you know,

1:30:36.200 --> 1:30:39.640
 subultimal choices. But as long as you're consistently reevaluating what you're doing,

1:30:39.640 --> 1:30:43.720
 and that's something I've tried to do over time, over and over and over again, and try to seek out

1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:52.920
 the most, the best and also most articulate or insightful instructors or people of various

1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:55.880
 levels, doesn't matter if they're well known or not that could say, hey, Ryan, I think you should

1:30:55.880 --> 1:31:00.360
 do this, I think you should do that. And I think all I've ever done in martial arts is try to treat

1:31:00.360 --> 1:31:05.800
 people with respect, honestly, try to demonstrate appreciation for the many, many people who have

1:31:05.800 --> 1:31:09.560
 helped me over time and be the type of person that they want to train with, not the type of,

1:31:09.560 --> 1:31:13.400
 because we've all trained with people that make us think about beating the ever loving crap in

1:31:13.400 --> 1:31:16.920
 the life. I never wanted to be that guy. And I was basically saying, like, if I train with a

1:31:16.920 --> 1:31:22.360
 black belt when I'm a blue belt, and this person enjoys training with me, that's in my interest.

1:31:22.360 --> 1:31:26.360
 Selfishly, not only do I not want them to beat me up, but selfishly, you mentioned being decent

1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:29.480
 to other people, you want to incentivize being decent to other people, right, with the structure

1:31:29.480 --> 1:31:35.400
 of what you're doing. Selfishly, I'm incentivized to be a nice guy, even if I'm internally a scumbag,

1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:39.640
 which I like to think that I'm not. But basically, going like, hey, this guy's way more likely to

1:31:39.640 --> 1:31:43.160
 help me, or this person's way more likely to help me if I shake their hand, say, thank you,

1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:47.800
 I really appreciate you helping me out. And that thing that they tapped me with four or five times,

1:31:47.800 --> 1:31:51.160
 I'm going to ask them about it. And then they don't have to tell me, they're under no obligation.

1:31:51.160 --> 1:31:54.760
 But I'll say, and when they tell me, don't thank you so much for your time, really appreciate it.

1:31:54.760 --> 1:31:58.200
 And that's it, you know. Okay, so to summarize,

1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:02.120
 what you really described, I just want to make sure we're keeping track of this.

1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:07.800
 I went all over the place. No, you didn't. You're pretty on point. But so the first thing is,

1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:11.320
 basically, which is difficult, I wonder if we can break it apart a little bit,

1:32:11.320 --> 1:32:14.680
 is don't trust authority, essentially. Keep asking why.

1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:16.600
 Be respectful without trusting authority, right?

1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:21.240
 Right. Which is, and then the second thing is be the kind of person that others like training

1:32:21.240 --> 1:32:28.840
 with, or like being around sort of being a good friend. So many people just enjoy being around.

1:32:28.840 --> 1:32:33.960
 So one is completely, which is, yeah, you're right, it's attention, which is like completely

1:32:33.960 --> 1:32:41.160
 disrespect the way that things are done. So asking why constantly. One of it is your own

1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:45.560
 flaws and not understanding the fundamentals of what's being described. And then once you get

1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:52.680
 good enough, not understanding, like going against the fact that the instructor doesn't

1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:56.840
 understand. And my inability to understand what you're saying, though, doesn't invalidate it.

1:32:56.840 --> 1:33:00.840
 And that's something like you mentioned, like me mentioning, keeping in mind our own flaws.

1:33:00.840 --> 1:33:04.920
 And then also, again, the flaws that any of us have as the instructor to your point. And I guess,

1:33:04.920 --> 1:33:09.480
 I can speak to being kind of weird. I don't, you know, I like to sit in the corner.

1:33:09.480 --> 1:33:13.880
 But so everyone's a little bit different. Some people like, you know, I wasn't terribly popular

1:33:13.880 --> 1:33:19.480
 in high school. I, you know, like, I didn't like high school very much. But anyway, yeah,

1:33:19.480 --> 1:33:23.320
 I would not going to be rude to people, though, I was never going to bully anybody. If you said,

1:33:23.320 --> 1:33:27.080
 hello to me, I'd say hello back. I would hold the door for you if you walked by, you know,

1:33:27.080 --> 1:33:32.040
 and I would just say like simple things like that go a long, long, long way. And that actually

1:33:32.040 --> 1:33:37.080
 takes us back to our, to our social discussion where I'm like, oh man, how do I become great at

1:33:37.080 --> 1:33:41.880
 jujitsu? It's like, well, I'll start by not pissing off this person who can beat the crap out of me

1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:47.080
 and not disrespecting the person who is probably the clearest, the closest thing to a font of

1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:52.760
 knowledge at that time for me. So, and then recognizing that I should do that for its own

1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:56.040
 virtue because it's the right thing to do and I should try to treat people decently. But beyond

1:33:56.040 --> 1:34:01.800
 that, even selfishly, it's in my interest to do that. But see, the thing is, this is interesting,

1:34:01.800 --> 1:34:09.640
 is there's a culture in martial arts, the culture that I like where the instructor legitimately so

1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:19.160
 carries an aura of authority. And it's not comfortable to really ask why. I'm not, it's,

1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:25.240
 it's a skill to be able to have a discussion as a white belt, the black belt instructor

1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:33.880
 of like, why is it done this way? Like, and saying why again? Like with, I mean,

1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:38.840
 it's a skill to show that you're actually a legitimately a curious and passionate and

1:34:38.840 --> 1:34:44.280
 compassionate student versus like somebody who's just being an annoying dick who saw some stuff

1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:52.040
 I knew too. There's a line between to walk there. I just wonder because like, it's the drilling thing.

1:34:52.040 --> 1:35:00.040
 And, you know, I, for example, like in my, when I was coming up, there was so much emphasis

1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:05.480
 placed on like close guard, for example. And you might, you might actually teach me now.

1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:13.640
 I don't know. But to me, it was like, why do I need to master the close guard? Like, why is the

1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:20.120
 closed guard on top or the bottom? But the bottom really is the fundamental basics of jiu jitsu.

1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:26.760
 Who decided that? My body is not, my body says this is wrong. I'm like, this,

1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:31.080
 like I have short legs, but doesn't even matter the length of the legs. There's something about

1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:37.880
 me that just, I don't understand how leverage here works for my particular body. Like, so

1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:46.200
 just, it's a feel thing too. Like, it feels like in my basic understanding of leverage and movement

1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:51.320
 and timing and so on, it feels like these certain like butterfly guard or even like half, basically

1:35:51.320 --> 1:36:00.360
 every guard except close guard. I can play, I can dance. Close guard feels like you're shutting down

1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:06.760
 like the play that I... Is that wrong? Or is that make sure that's what you want? Because that's

1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:10.840
 almost like an innate characteristic of this guard position, but it's not sold that way, right?

1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:16.360
 It's like, hey, this is a good guard. It's like, hey man, here's a bow and arrow versus, and you

1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:20.840
 know how to use this thing, right? Like make sure you're far away and like up on a hill or something

1:36:20.840 --> 1:36:25.160
 because you can take that bow and arrow, run up on something and try to use it. But if nobody told

1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:29.320
 you not to do that and they told you it was foundational, it's very foundational, it's very

1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:33.960
 important. To everything else too, right? That's back to the shrimping thing. How many things are

1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:41.880
 we taught that even if it's not, let's say itself is not a garbage thing, might be effectively garbage.

1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:47.240
 You could give me a Ferrari, but if I try to make it fly, it's not going to work. If you're like,

1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:50.280
 here's a plane, here's another plane, here's another plane, here's another plane, here's a

1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:54.360
 Ferrari. I'm like, oh, it must be a different type of plane. You could be forgiven for leap if we're

1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:57.960
 going there. Like, oh, maybe the wings come out or you just go fast enough to take a bullet. You

1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:02.840
 can make these crazy leaps in your mind and people are doing that all the time. So if you

1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:09.880
 don't provide the context for me, or worse yet, you provide improper context, how much of a problem

1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:16.360
 is that going to be? Well, I think the skill of the white belt should just be nice. But in the

1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:25.080
 complicated human space of when your intention, at least in the big picture view, is good. The

1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:32.120
 question is, it's not always when your intention is good, the actual implementation of it is good.

1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:37.960
 So you might be just almost, and that's much, it's not the case for you, it's much more the case

1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:42.280
 for white belts. They don't even know, their intention might be good, but they don't know

1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:49.400
 all the lines they're crossing, all the, so they're not actually able to interpret all the ways in

1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:54.280
 which they're being totally insensitive to the requests of others, the explicit requests of

1:37:54.280 --> 1:38:01.000
 others. So your job as a beginner is to be a really good listener of those social cues.

1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:04.680
 It's like a visitor in a foreign country, right? Yeah. Like you're a representative of people

1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:08.120
 that look like you, people that talk like you, people that have your passport, and you're like,

1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:11.640
 man, I'm going to go over here. I've got my foot up on my knee. Well, if I was in a certain country

1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:15.640
 in the world, that's rude. I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry. But can you imagine if someone says,

1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:19.160
 hey, I really appreciate if you take your foot off, that's pretty rude. And then I want to

1:38:19.160 --> 1:38:24.120
 tell them, well, not where I'm from, man, I'm in your house. I better, again, I may go that

1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:27.720
 direction, but let's say I could get away with that. Now I'm a bully. And if I can't get away

1:38:27.720 --> 1:38:33.000
 with that, I'm about to maybe be on the wrong side of something. But I guess, like you said,

1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:36.200
 if we have positive intention, that's fine. But I also have to recognize who I am. And I think

1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:41.400
 that that's one thing that I tried to do and continue to try to do over time. Like we're,

1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:46.440
 oh man, hi, I'm the one that's asking for a favor here. If I spar with Raymond Daniels,

1:38:46.440 --> 1:38:51.240
 Raymond Daniels is doing me a favor. I ain't doing him a favor. Let's not get it twisted.

1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:54.920
 So thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate these are not, and this is not like

1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:58.440
 some affected nonsense. This is serious. I'm like, thank you. If I spar with Steven Thompson,

1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:01.480
 I'm the one being done a favor. George St. Pierre takes his time to spar with me,

1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:05.640
 which he has in the past, and not even kill me, which is really, I appreciate that because that's

1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:12.600
 why I can sit here. George is not a prop for me to get my rocks off or see what's going on. And

1:39:12.600 --> 1:39:17.560
 also, I'm going to do that and then expect him to just take it. And I've seen, he's a gentleman.

1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:23.560
 I've seen people get nuts with George and have him just be like, he's a patient of a saint.

1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:25.800
 I don't have that level of patience. But I would just say to come back,

1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:30.840
 figuring out like, hey, so what role am I here? And that comes back to at least what I see people

1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:35.160
 on the internet. Yeah, man, I have a beef with Joe Rogan. You're like, no, you don't, Ryan. You're

1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:40.200
 some goof. I'm like, I'm some random dude. People want to, they almost want to elevate

1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:45.080
 so that we can somehow be level or peers here. If I go into Faraz Zahabi's gym, I'm not a peer

1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:49.880
 of Faraz Zahabi. I'm a student of Tristar. I'm a guest in the academy. And if Faraz asked me for

1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:54.440
 something short of him telling me to try to do a triple backflip so I'm going to break my neck,

1:39:54.440 --> 1:39:59.000
 the answer is, yes, sir, I can do it for you Faraz. No, man. And hopefully it should come with,

1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.000
 I guess, a level of graciousness. But I guess that's kind of one of the things that I see nowadays

1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:07.800
 with how accessible people are. Because I grew up being a big, huge base sports fan of all kinds.

1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:15.560
 I couldn't send Derek Jeter a message and much less have a possibility of a reply. And if I do,

1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:19.960
 it's like, you know, I have people sending messages. It's very nice that people send messages.

1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:25.080
 Some people, again, not everyone is coming from the same place. But plenty of things are like,

1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:28.600
 yo, dude, I need you to do this for me. And I'm like, well, I'll tell you what's never going to

1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:33.400
 happen. That I have no idea who you are. And that was how I was addressed. And I don't need,

1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:37.320
 oh, man, you're the greatest one, because that's weird and two, because I'm not. But just, hey,

1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:42.120
 Ryan, how are you doing? Hey, do you think you could do the following if you get a second? Like,

1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:46.360
 if I get a second, you're dang right, Ken, why not? It's easy to ask. But it started with some

1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:51.320
 level of politeness. And I guess that's maybe being semi Southern, like I grew up in Virginia.

1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:56.760
 Yes, sir. Yes, ma'm. Yeah, well, there's all different kinds of implementations of politeness.

1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:02.600
 I mean, most of the successful people I've met, it's been surprising to me how much of,

1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:10.280
 you mentioned peers. Like I could think of Joe Rogan, you mentioned Joe Rogan. But you know,

1:41:10.280 --> 1:41:18.360
 Musk, they don't, like they almost treat me like I'm the superior. You know what I mean? Like,

1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:24.040
 it's not even, it's that's the politeness. Like, you know, that's the approach, the feeling of it

1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:29.080
 is like, I'm the student, I'm the beginner, I'm like approaching the situation. Like, it's, it's,

1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:37.160
 it's almost like method acting of like, you're better than me. And that's how I approach a

1:41:37.160 --> 1:41:41.080
 lot of interactions. Like I have something to learn from this, even if it's like a young...

1:41:41.080 --> 1:41:42.680
 Do you think that they're ungenuine?

1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:43.640
 They're totally genuine.

1:41:44.200 --> 1:41:47.320
 But it's not a funny thing. Like in spite of who they are, they're incredibly genuine because

1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:50.360
 they respect, correct me if I'm wrong, they respect you obviously for what you bring to the

1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:52.120
 table. No, no, they approach everybody like this.

1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:54.680
 But that's what I might know. But they, I'm sure they respect what you bring to the table.

1:41:54.680 --> 1:41:57.400
 Beyond that, though, they're treating you with dignity as a human being.

1:41:57.400 --> 1:41:58.200
 As a human being.

1:41:58.200 --> 1:41:58.760
 Which that's right.

1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:03.320
 When they could probably get away with treating most people without a whole heck of a lot of

1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:06.200
 dignity. And I guess, what does that always say that, like, you know, again, like you can always

1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:10.680
 tell someone of quality because they treat the king and the janitor the same way.

1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:16.520
 But that's what we're seeing a lot. Like, I guess, I don't mean to nitpick, but that's where

1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:19.080
 take issue, I guess, a little bit or disagree with...

1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:21.160
 Are you going to criticize the internet again?

1:42:21.160 --> 1:42:21.560
 No.

1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:31.240
 Man yells at clouds. But anyway, but I guess what I mean is just like the way that people address

1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:35.480
 each other because it's so casual now. And it's great on the one hand, it's nice.

1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:40.680
 On the other hand, you go, hey, just why can't... Am I somehow...

1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:42.440
 Am I worried about diminishing myself?

1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:45.080
 It's like the way that I'm sure that people talk to like talk to women sometimes.

1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:49.480
 And words, you know, so girl, man, she's a bitch.

1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:53.720
 You know, versus like, well, that was supposed to get a good response.

1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:57.320
 What about that was going to elicit a favorable response?

1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:02.120
 You know, versus being anything, anything other than just, you know, man, what's going on?

1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:03.640
 And I guess that doesn't make any sense.

1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:06.360
 No, it makes total sense. And that Southern thing that you're referring to,

1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:11.560
 I feel like that's an important, that's an important part of human communication.

1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:13.800
 Let me ask you this.

1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:14.600
 Sure.

1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:19.080
 Your new back attacks instructional, first of all, awesome.

1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:19.320
 Yeah.

1:43:20.600 --> 1:43:27.640
 Second of all, you drop a lot of fascinating insights in there, but you quote Galileo out of

1:43:27.640 --> 1:43:31.080
 all people in saying that you can't teach a man anything.

1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:33.480
 You can only help him find it within himself.

1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:38.760
 So we talked about how to start in Jiu Jitsu.

1:43:39.640 --> 1:43:45.800
 What about if we zoom out even more and how do you learn how to learn?

1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:48.680
 How do you optimize the learning process?

1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:52.680
 I don't know the answer to that, but I can tell you what I like to do.

1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:54.680
 And I would say like, I can't step one.

1:43:54.680 --> 1:43:57.640
 I don't, I'm not, maybe this is a little bit easier for me because, you know,

1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:01.240
 I've never had a ton of friends, honestly, you know, I've got my close friends and people

1:44:01.240 --> 1:44:03.960
 that I know, but I've never had tons and tons of people.

1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:06.040
 So I spent a lot of time, you know, thinking.

1:44:06.040 --> 1:44:10.440
 And anyway, I can't, I can't control you.

1:44:10.440 --> 1:44:11.960
 I can't control anybody else.

1:44:11.960 --> 1:44:19.800
 I, you know, I, all I can, I want to take my, I'll get to the Marcus Aurelius thing.

1:44:19.800 --> 1:44:22.760
 It's like, you know, I guess the trick to life is figuring out what's in our control

1:44:22.760 --> 1:44:25.800
 and what's not and focusing on things that are in our control, I guess.

1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:32.520
 And so step one is figuring out both internally and then also out in, in the world as it pertains

1:44:32.520 --> 1:44:35.480
 to Jitsu, what is actually in my control and what is not.

1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:37.560
 Like passing someone's guard is not in your control.

1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:38.600
 People think it is, it ain't.

1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:45.880
 If I can't just do an activity and be unchecked, then it ain't in my control entirely.

1:44:46.600 --> 1:44:47.800
 I can always breathe.

1:44:47.800 --> 1:44:51.480
 I can always, you know, be calm.

1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:55.320
 I can always, no matter whether I'm concerned or not concerned,

1:44:55.320 --> 1:44:59.160
 have whatever you want to call it nerves, you know, I, I can step forward across the line

1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:01.400
 and say, I will, I will face the challenge ahead.

1:45:01.400 --> 1:45:03.560
 That is all entirely, no one can stop me from doing that.

1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:04.600
 That's entirely me I control.

1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:08.440
 And that's why I know that every single time that I walk into the ring, I'll walk in and

1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:13.240
 out of there with my head a little high because there's, I will fight with everything that I have.

1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:14.920
 I can't promise that I'll win.

1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:19.560
 I would say I take that same first principles you mentioned last time we talked, you know,

1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:24.440
 with Elon and the importance of that and going, what are the first principles?

1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:27.800
 And I guess to come back a lot of times in my opinion, the things that people think are the

1:45:27.800 --> 1:45:29.320
 basics are not the basics.

1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:31.400
 You can't learn.

1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:35.000
 If you think you're reasoning for first principles, but you're actually like level six,

1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:39.720
 you're actually like layers up, you're making so many, there's so many baked in assumptions

1:45:39.720 --> 1:45:44.200
 to what's going on that you're going to struggle to understand why anything is actually happening

1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:46.200
 internally, externally, you name it.

1:45:46.200 --> 1:45:49.880
 So I guess what I would start when it comes to learning is first principles and trying

1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:53.240
 to understand what's going on, but then also simple things first.

1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:54.520
 I can control my posture.

1:45:56.040 --> 1:45:57.240
 I can control my breathing.

1:45:58.440 --> 1:45:59.800
 No one can stop me from doing that.

1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:01.640
 I can control where I place my frames.

1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:03.560
 I can control where I place my limbs.

1:46:03.560 --> 1:46:05.400
 I can move my feet.

1:46:05.400 --> 1:46:07.720
 I can develop the ability to do these things better, of course.

1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:10.360
 And I do that through practice, through drilling, through watching people.

1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:14.120
 I've been incredibly fortunate in my time in martial arts to train with many of my heroes,

1:46:14.120 --> 1:46:16.120
 to train with many of the people that I looked at.

1:46:16.120 --> 1:46:18.360
 And I was like, that guy is amazing.

1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:19.480
 I want to train with this person.

1:46:19.480 --> 1:46:24.760
 Like Stephen Thompson, Kenny Florian, George St. Pierre, Raymond Daniels, Faraz Ahabi,

1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:30.520
 you know, I mean, like Bruno Frasado, Marcelo Garcia, all of these guys that are just unbelievable.

1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:33.720
 And I go, well, they're moving in a way that's different.

1:46:33.720 --> 1:46:34.600
 Well, how do I do that?

1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:37.000
 Well, sometimes you can ask them and they can tell you directly.

1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:40.840
 Other times people, part of the genius of what they do is that it's intuitive.

1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:44.360
 And maybe they don't think and understand and see the world the same way that I do.

1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:46.120
 That was something that I experienced with Marcelo.

1:46:46.760 --> 1:46:47.320
 He's amazing.

1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:53.400
 But in a different way than his, it just, we see things fundamentally different.

1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:54.600
 We experience the world differently.

1:46:54.600 --> 1:46:55.640
 It seems to me that we do.

1:46:56.200 --> 1:47:00.360
 And again, that taught me a really important lesson because I was wanting when I trained

1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:03.720
 there to have someone go, hey, Ryan, do this, this, this, and this, and then that's how it works.

1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:06.680
 And I was like, all right, because that's how I understood martial arts at the time.

1:47:07.880 --> 1:47:14.440
 I wasn't ready to have someone tell me like, hey, it feels a little bit like this.

1:47:14.440 --> 1:47:19.160
 And I just kind of do it, which is kind of what Marcelo would do at the time as he was

1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:20.600
 less experienced as a teacher.

1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:22.680
 But that is what he was doing.

1:47:22.680 --> 1:47:28.520
 I was completely, I couldn't separate in my mind performance and understanding.

1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:29.960
 I thought that if I understand, I could do it.

1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:35.720
 And I would also struggle sometimes to wonder why I couldn't execute things that I thought

1:47:35.720 --> 1:47:40.040
 I understood and why guys like Marcelo were just so elemental.

1:47:40.040 --> 1:47:45.000
 I mean, in like the lightning wind, like that type of thing, it's just so in touch with

1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:47.480
 what they wanted, with their capabilities.

1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:49.240
 They could summon their powers at will.

1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:51.560
 I couldn't always do that.

1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:57.160
 And I guess, so recognizing that there was more than one way to the top of the mountain.

1:47:57.160 --> 1:47:59.640
 And also, I had a lot of science, but I didn't have a lot of art.

1:47:59.640 --> 1:48:01.800
 Or I had some science, I should say, but I didn't have a lot of art.

1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:04.120
 Meeting people like Marcelo taught me.

1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:08.200
 And then Josh Waitskin, actually, brilliant guy, chess champion, former owner,

1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:10.440
 maybe owner of Marcelo's Academy, really great friend.

1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:11.640
 I think he has a book on learning.

1:48:11.640 --> 1:48:11.960
 He does.

1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:13.080
 Yeah, the art of learning, actually.

1:48:13.080 --> 1:48:13.720
 The art of learning, yeah.

1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:15.480
 But yeah, he knows a thing or two about it.

1:48:15.480 --> 1:48:16.120
 But a great guy.

1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:18.200
 And anyway, he sat me down one time and was like,

1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:19.800
 Litman, you're doing this wrong.

1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:20.840
 You're missing what?

1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:23.800
 They're missing the genius, the brilliance, this right in front of you.

1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:26.280
 And it took me a long time.

1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:26.920
 What did he mean?

1:48:27.720 --> 1:48:33.560
 That I was frustrated with my inability to grasp certain things and sometimes the

1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:34.760
 teaching style being different.

1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:38.600
 Not wrong, it was tough for me at the time.

1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:41.480
 So you were trying to replicate what Marcelo was saying as opposed to

1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:45.960
 understanding the fundamentals from which he was coming?

1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:48.680
 Right, I couldn't see where it was coming from.

1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:51.560
 And also, sometimes I'm like, well, why can't you explain it in the way that

1:48:51.560 --> 1:48:52.840
 I would want you to explain it?

1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:55.720
 And he's like, well, why can't I meet him where he's coming from?

1:48:55.720 --> 1:48:59.240
 So anyway, it was a really important time, unless I'm very, very frustrating,

1:48:59.240 --> 1:48:59.720
 if I'm honest.

1:48:59.720 --> 1:49:03.240
 But it's not, I'm so thankful for that time.

1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:05.800
 And anyway, I guess...

1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:09.400
 It's always the first principles, trying to understand the basics, first starting at

1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:14.200
 the place where you can control things, the very basic elements of what you can work with.

1:49:14.840 --> 1:49:18.040
 And then when there's other mentors and teachers to...

1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:19.880
 Meet them where they're coming from.

1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:20.440
 Meet them.

1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:21.640
 To the extent that I can.

1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:25.320
 Rather than I'm not, again, it's like, why are you not talking to me the way I want

1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:28.200
 you to talk to me, as opposed to, hey, where are you coming from?

1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:28.920
 Back to your point.

1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:29.560
 Yeah.

1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:32.040
 But I don't know that's not entirely specific.

1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:37.000
 But if you can focus on that, and back to the whole, you can't teach a man anything.

1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:38.760
 Marcelo didn't teach me anything.

1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:44.920
 But he taught me in so doing, and other people like that, to find it within.

1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:48.760
 And it's like, yeah, I guess something else that I've heard before is that all learning

1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:52.040
 is self discovery, but all performance is self expression.

1:49:52.040 --> 1:49:56.040
 And I always thought that Marcelo was a brilliant master of letting what's inside out.

1:49:56.040 --> 1:49:58.920
 He was so consistent in his performances.

1:49:58.920 --> 1:50:02.440
 And a lot of times I felt like there was a block there personally, particularly at the

1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:04.760
 end of Jiu Jitsu when I was very, very results oriented.

1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:05.800
 And I wasn't...

1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:08.200
 I think my focus was not ideal.

1:50:08.200 --> 1:50:10.840
 It was definitely not in the place that I would like it to be.

1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:13.800
 And whether it would have won more or lost more hard to say, but I know that I would have

1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:15.400
 performed better if I'd have adjusted that.

1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:19.960
 And anyway, recognizing that, again, Jiu Jitsu, I think I've said it before,

1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:22.760
 Jiu Jitsu studies as a science, but expressed as an art.

1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:25.320
 It doesn't matter if you can articulate what you know how to do.

1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:27.240
 What matters is if you can do what you know how to do.

1:50:27.240 --> 1:50:31.240
 It only matters if you're teaching in a verbal fashion, whether or not you can articulate it.

1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:37.400
 But recognizing the difference between learning on an intellectual level or conceptual level

1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:40.280
 and being able to translate that into the physical.

1:50:40.280 --> 1:50:44.120
 And I guess that's been the thing that I feel fortunate over time in my own academy

1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:47.480
 to be able to kind of fiddle around and learn on my own and practice my students.

1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:50.360
 And sometimes I struggle to have great training partners.

1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:53.800
 Like when I say great training partners, I mean other world class people to spar or to roll with.

1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:58.280
 But I've gotten a lot more honestly than I ever would have thought out of being able to practice

1:50:58.280 --> 1:51:02.360
 and learn and fail and try and succeed in my own without like my own little sandbox.

1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:10.120
 Figuring out how I can take an idea and then come up with drills and drills to practice it

1:51:10.120 --> 1:51:12.200
 so that I can actually practice putting it into play.

1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:14.440
 Because again, knowing an idea and then not drilling,

1:51:15.160 --> 1:51:18.040
 what's the point? I'll never have it. It'll never see the light of day.

1:51:18.040 --> 1:51:24.200
 So in that DVD, in that instruction DVD, sorry. It's an online instructional DVD.

1:51:24.200 --> 1:51:25.960
 That's a DVD. I keep saying DVD though.

1:51:25.960 --> 1:51:27.720
 Nobody has DVDs anymore. Do they not?

1:51:27.720 --> 1:51:31.480
 It's like VHS. I don't know. Who has DVDs? Well, like Blu Ray.

1:51:31.480 --> 1:51:34.280
 I possess some DVDs. I mean, I've never watched them.

1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:39.960
 What do you use them for? Like a cup, like a cup, like a thing you put a drink on?

1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:42.280
 I mean, it went in a pinch, yeah.

1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:47.960
 Yeah. What's that even called?

1:51:48.840 --> 1:51:51.800
 Coaster? Yeah, my Matrix Coaster.

1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.800
 The Matrix Coaster, zeros and ones. Okay.

1:51:57.240 --> 1:52:01.800
 So in that instruction that people should get, I've been watching. I'm really enjoying.

1:52:03.080 --> 1:52:06.280
 It's, I don't even know when it came out recently, right?

1:52:06.280 --> 1:52:07.560
 Like December or something like that?

1:52:07.560 --> 1:52:12.200
 Yeah. It's part one. It's actually like ended up being like 18 hours long.

1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:13.960
 And I was like, oh my God, we're going to chop in half.

1:52:13.960 --> 1:52:17.240
 And when it comes together, the whole thing, I think I hope people will like it.

1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:19.320
 Yeah. Well, it's even part one is really good.

1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:23.480
 It's actually, yeah, people on Reddit were really excited for part two as well.

1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:24.840
 Really? And you also have a back.

1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:26.360
 Oh, the old one?

1:52:26.360 --> 1:52:32.520
 The old one that I, that was really helpful to me to understand some very basic aspects of control

1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:38.520
 from the back. Yeah. That was, you know, that clicked with me. There's very few instructional

1:52:38.520 --> 1:52:44.360
 models. There's very few things I've watched that ever clicked with me. And that was definitely it.

1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:51.560
 It taught me one thing. I don't know. It's, you have, you drop a lot of sort of bombs.

1:52:51.560 --> 1:52:58.840
 You have dropped a lot of really interesting details. And it's funny that there's only specific

1:52:58.840 --> 1:53:03.480
 things that really click. Like a lot of it rings true and you kind of take it in and it's like,

1:53:03.480 --> 1:53:07.880
 oh, that's interesting. Okay. Yeah. But there's certain things that really click. And I remember

1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:15.720
 that first instruction will click with me is like the importance. I don't, I don't remember

1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:20.760
 anymore like how you communicated it because I'm now integrated. It's now mine. You know what I mean?

1:53:21.640 --> 1:53:27.640
 But it was more about you just describing upper body control and the importance of the upper body

1:53:27.640 --> 1:53:34.840
 control from the back. And just like the, there's certain, like you describe different details on

1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:41.880
 the grips and so on. And as I started trying it, I realized how important upper body control is

1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:48.600
 versus like me, I mean, maybe as a blue belt or something was, I thought like you have achieved

1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:54.280
 victory when you got the two hooks in. And then I realized like, at least for me, that the hooks

1:53:54.280 --> 1:53:59.880
 were not even for my body type, for my style, for the way I approach things, they were not even

1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:04.280
 important at all. Supplemental for the most part. Yeah. So they were there for the points,

1:54:04.280 --> 1:54:11.800
 but I can establish a huge amount of control. In fact, the hooks were, you were talking about

1:54:11.800 --> 1:54:18.040
 like illusion of choice. It's, it's a, it almost made people panic a lot more when you were like

1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:22.680
 fighting for or establishing that kind of control. They weren't a lot less panicked when the hooks

1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:27.320
 weren't involved. Even though they should be a lot more panicked. Anyway, I realized a lot

1:54:27.320 --> 1:54:32.920
 of those kinds of things, especially they had to do with judo because so much of judo on the ground

1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:39.320
 is centered around aggressive, efficient, very fast choking, like different kinds of clock

1:54:39.320 --> 1:54:42.920
 chokes and all that kind of stuff. What a brilliant thing that is only going to start

1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:47.000
 to make its way into jitsu coming up. But like the judo style approach to like clock choking,

1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:52.760
 triangleing from the top of the turtle and stuff is so powerful. Yeah. And the, there's something

1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:58.280
 about judo that emphasizes obviously due to the rules, the urgency. So there are only two

1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:05.160
 techniques that go fast. And then the other thing is, which I guess jiu jitsu emphasizes too,

1:55:05.160 --> 1:55:12.280
 but judo really does, which is the transition. So like while the person's flying in the air is

1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:19.880
 the easiest time. I mean, this is like Ryan Hall type of shit, which is like, why not putting

1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:25.080
 your submissions or positional control while they're in the air? And if you could, why would you

1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:30.440
 not? Right? Oh, I don't throw well, we'll learn how to throw and then do it. And so you should think,

1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:35.560
 I mean, in a transition, when they're flying is the easiest time to put in stuff. And that's

1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:41.400
 when you think about chokes, as you're throwing, you should be thinking about the choke. And then

1:55:41.400 --> 1:55:48.120
 everything becomes a lot easier. You ever see Flavio Kanto? Man, Brazilian judoka is just so

1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:53.480
 cool. Like with stuff like that. Yeah, exactly. But that has to do with the first starting principle

1:55:53.480 --> 1:56:01.000
 of like, stop thinking this as a two phase game of standing and then ground. Start thinking about

1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:06.680
 like the standing and the standing comes before and the ground comes after, but everything happens

1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:10.680
 in a transition. Well, unless you're attacking, what is the art of war? Like we all like everyone's

1:56:10.680 --> 1:56:14.360
 like, oh, yeah, the art of war. Yes, yes. And then they immediately throw it away and then fight

1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:22.760
 like a freaking barbarian. But how many people quote stuff? And then like, it's like, what is

1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:26.200
 it? The family guy joke or they're like, quoting Jesus and Jesus walks in and he's like, you're

1:56:26.200 --> 1:56:33.320
 not doing my work. What are you talking about? And anyway, basically, the art of war, one of the

1:56:33.320 --> 1:56:37.240
 things is like the only thing that you can be sure of being successful in attacking is something

1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:42.600
 that's undefended. We're like, yeah, but you know, in a fight though, they're defended. Well,

1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:48.600
 are they? There's moments all the time where I'm borderline defenseless. And if you were to attack

1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:52.520
 at that moment, if you could see it and then seize the moment, if you were capable of both,

1:56:53.160 --> 1:56:56.120
 you should not only expect to be successful, you should be damn sure you're gonna be successful.

1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:58.760
 And more important than that, you'll be successful. And even if you're somehow not,

1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:05.800
 you won't be countered. And I guess like, that's the trick of almost all like conflict, right?

1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:10.600
 It's like showing up when the other person's taking a nap. And then it's so funny, we take

1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:14.920
 like a protracted war. It's like, oh, it takes five years. And there's lulls and there's a battle

1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:17.800
 this month, but then there's a couple of weeks and another battle. It's like, well, if you just

1:57:17.800 --> 1:57:22.280
 shrink that down, it's the microcosm, macrocosm idea. That same thing, that whole war is taking

1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:27.000
 place in five minutes or 10 minutes or 15 minutes. And there's moments of lulls of person

1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:31.400
 effectively going for a snack, being like in a horror movie like, hey, guys, I'm gonna go get a

1:57:31.400 --> 1:57:37.320
 beer from the, from around the way, like I'm dead for sure. So anyway, is there on this particular

1:57:37.320 --> 1:57:43.960
 instructional, if you can convert it to words, you talk about finishing the submission. Is there

1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:50.840
 some interesting insights that you find beautiful or profound about finishing the rear necki choke

1:57:51.560 --> 1:57:55.000
 or just finishing submissions from the back control? Is there something like,

1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:59.560
 you know, you talk about the squeeze and the crush and all these kinds of principles?

1:57:59.560 --> 1:58:08.040
 Is there something about control about the process of finishing that you find especially

1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:12.280
 profound about this position? Absolutely. The opposite of one profound truth can be another

1:58:12.280 --> 1:58:20.280
 profound truth. So like, it's, I do. Did Jesus say that? No, I don't, I actually was a guy on

1:58:20.280 --> 1:58:26.760
 Tumblr. But yeah, it was really, really cool. There was like a tree in the background. But anyway,

1:58:26.760 --> 1:58:34.600
 but so let's say like, I'll use, I'll use examples like first off, I saw someone finishing a 5050

1:58:34.600 --> 1:58:39.960
 heel hook in the UFC one promo. It was like some chubby dude in the karate, like inside heel hook

1:58:39.960 --> 1:58:45.560
 and another dude. And you go, huh, well, I didn't know they were doing that back then, at least,

1:58:45.560 --> 1:58:49.800
 and whether they were doing it all, how many times does someone do something? And then that

1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:53.880
 works. And then we go, okay, cool versus, hey, maybe we should do that all the time. So anyway,

1:58:53.880 --> 1:58:58.040
 how long did we all talk through the seat belt, the way we all do the seat belt in Jiu Jitsu?

1:58:58.040 --> 1:59:04.520
 Like long time. Why? Works. In fact, it works so well. And it was so, it was then the people who

1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:11.720
 used it were so prolific that we went, well, solve that one. Good to go. All right, no more thinking.

1:59:11.720 --> 1:59:15.640
 And then you go, imagine you were to like the Merkel and Merkel flip all those positions that

1:59:15.640 --> 1:59:18.840
 we're showing in the, in the DVD, which is pretty much sort of the whatever the heck it is, and

1:59:18.840 --> 1:59:26.280
 like the digital VD. No, not VD. I don't want that digital, digital video or something. But

1:59:26.280 --> 1:59:33.320
 basically recognizing that doing it on the wrong side is at least as effective. It doesn't mean

1:59:33.320 --> 1:59:37.560
 that the other side wasn't good. There could be something that's the literal borderline opposite

1:59:37.560 --> 1:59:44.520
 of that. And you go, huh, well, that's something like imagine like, I would say almost all of

1:59:44.520 --> 1:59:48.040
 these things, all the tactics and all the strategies. So I guess that was something that we came to

1:59:48.040 --> 1:59:52.280
 like training in the gym like a year ago, maybe I've been playing with since and it's just,

1:59:52.280 --> 1:59:55.320
 it's huge. I'm like, oh wait, so let me get this straight. First, if I can use my strong side seat

1:59:55.320 --> 1:59:59.320
 belt, my right arm over the shoulder and it all the time. Well, that's, that's really helpful

1:59:59.320 --> 2:00:02.520
 because that's a lot better than my left. I can do both sides of my left. But if I had to bet my

2:00:02.520 --> 2:00:07.000
 life on, on being able to finish it, I would want my right arm over. Huh. Everything that's a tactic

2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:11.800
 or a strategy evolved from an idea like capitalism is an idea, you know, anarchy is an idea. And

2:00:11.800 --> 2:00:14.600
 then it becomes, well, what does that all mean? What are the, what are the consequences? What's

2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:19.800
 the fallout of all this, right? So what if we start with Jiu Jitsu, the idea of the guard,

2:00:19.800 --> 2:00:23.560
 right? And we go, well, I mean, when do you, why do you use the guard? No other martial art really

2:00:23.560 --> 2:00:27.960
 has developed the guard in the same way that Jiu Jitsu has. Well, what is the guard? A guard's

2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:32.280
 a defensive idea where you're kind of on your back to some extent or another and you're using

2:00:32.280 --> 2:00:36.120
 your legs as a wall between you and the other person and the other guy represents danger.

2:00:36.120 --> 2:00:40.520
 And you're like, yeah, yeah, that's a great idea. Is it? I mean, it clearly works at least to a

2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:45.400
 certain extent, but where do I want to put my legs when I want to get up? Not on the other

2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:49.400
 dude. I'm trying to put them on things on the floor. If I want to generate a ton of power,

2:00:49.400 --> 2:00:53.160
 what's the first thing I do with my feet? I anchor them to the floor, drive for a punch,

2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:58.760
 you name it, move away, jump, dart, you name it. So does it mean that that's a terrible idea to be

2:00:58.760 --> 2:01:04.200
 on your back? No, clearly it works. And clearly it has function. But what if the function that

2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:09.640
 we're giving it and we're, and the, how much, how much focus we're assigning to it is disproportionate

2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:14.040
 to its effectiveness. Maybe what if it's not a good idea? I'm not saying it's not a good idea,

2:01:14.040 --> 2:01:18.680
 but what if it wasn't? That's a foundational idea of jujitsu. And then how much, because no one

2:01:18.680 --> 2:01:23.560
 questions that foundation, how much innovation is built on top of the idea? Well, of course,

2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:27.160
 I want to be, my being on my back is an okay position. So now they're innovating,

2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:30.760
 but they're innovating within a closed system that they don't, they think they're innovating in,

2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:34.200
 in like, in this open space of, oh my God, it can be anything when in reality,

2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:37.720
 it can be anything within this little set. But you don't realize that you're in a set,

2:01:37.720 --> 2:01:41.480
 you don't realize that you're in a box. There would be answers that would become so immediately

2:01:41.480 --> 2:01:46.280
 apparent to you if you were willing to look outside of that. But you'll literally never

2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:49.800
 even look over to your left because you don't even realize the left exists.

2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:54.360
 Do you think there's a lot of places in jujitsu where there's back control or generally guards

2:01:54.360 --> 2:02:01.640
 in all the different positions where there's a lot of space, like a lot, a lot to be discovered

2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:06.040
 by questioning the basic assumptions. Maybe if you can give examples of like back control,

2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:08.040
 like is there something you've discovered that's like...

2:02:08.040 --> 2:02:09.480
 Merkle versus seatbelt.

2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:10.680
 What's Merkle with seatbelt?

2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:15.400
 Seatbelt is a right arm over the shoulder, left arm under the arm. I'm on the,

2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:20.440
 I'm on the same side as my choking arm. Merkle is just, I do the same thing. I'm even just my hands.

2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:23.720
 I walk myself over to the left side. I'm on the opposite side. It's actually a more powerful

2:02:23.720 --> 2:02:29.320
 position. Yeah. For people listening or for people who might not know, jujitsu is a seatbelt

2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:33.880
 is a control. We're talking about when one person is on the back of another person,

2:02:33.880 --> 2:02:39.480
 which is a really dominant position in jujitsu. Seatbelt is a, I guess, widely accepted

2:02:40.680 --> 2:02:42.440
 way of holding your arm. Best practices almost.

2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:48.440
 Best practices. Yeah. And it's worked so well. So it's a one arm over, one arm under,

2:02:49.080 --> 2:02:53.640
 and there's a certain side you're supposed to be on when you're on the back. You know,

2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:58.600
 everyone teaches. There's a choking arm. That's the arm that's over and your body's supposed to be

2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:05.480
 in a certain side relative to that. And then Ryan is describing questioning these like basic

2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:08.680
 assumptions of which side you're supposed to be on. And let's say that's even just like a

2:03:08.680 --> 2:03:12.200
 mid level assumption. It's not even a first principles assumption, but it's pretty close

2:03:12.200 --> 2:03:17.080
 to, it's getting there. But let's just say for sake of argument, it goes a lot deeper, maybe.

2:03:18.120 --> 2:03:23.320
 I think most of the innovation that I see is not innovation. It's like basically changing the

2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:28.840
 color of a car or polishing like the window a little bit. We're like, hey, you made it a little

2:03:28.840 --> 2:03:32.680
 bit different. You made it a little bit better. It's like, oh man, what if I did the same guard

2:03:32.680 --> 2:03:37.080
 and then grab the lapel? I'm not saying that's bad, but you're not fundamentally changing anything.

2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:41.480
 I think most of the big seismic shifts that we see in almost anything come from, hey,

2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:47.960
 that thing we thought was right was wrong rather than not only is it right, it's even righter.

2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:51.640
 And you're like, that's not wrong. That's not bad. But that's, it's like, oh man,

2:03:51.640 --> 2:03:53.880
 let's say, for instance, I didn't make the triangle better, but let's say I made the

2:03:53.880 --> 2:03:59.480
 triangle a little bit better than it was or than it was taught. I mean, you can call it

2:03:59.480 --> 2:04:02.600
 innovation. I don't know, man. It's not like the person that said, hey, have you guys ever heard

2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:07.160
 of a triangle before and came up with that? We're like, that's on the list. You can do this thing

2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:11.640
 to people? Are you kidding me? Can you imagine you invented the straight right hand? You'll be

2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:15.880
 like one punch, man. You can walk around and just lay low every single person you got into a fight

2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:20.200
 with because it didn't even occur to them to hit you with their backhand. In a world full of

2:04:20.200 --> 2:04:24.280
 jabbers, you throw your backhand. You're going to kill people. So basically...

2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:28.920
 Well, by the way, I mean, just to pause on that, first of all, somebody did invent the triangle

2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:32.040
 probably, right? For sure. It's not a trivial thing once you think...

2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:36.360
 No. How many of these giant things that we all go like, oh yeah, we all use that now.

2:04:36.360 --> 2:04:40.520
 Can you imagine you have triangles and heel hooks and we're naked chokes and I don't have those?

2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:44.600
 You're on beat, you're borderline. I mean, like, that's why we all experience,

2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:47.000
 every single one of this, particularly those of us, I mean, when did you first start training

2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:53.640
 Alex? 12, 13 years. Well, let's not count wrestling, but 13 years ago with Jiu Jitsu.

2:04:53.640 --> 2:04:57.720
 Right on. So let's say about that time where particularly it was still like kind of undergroundy.

2:04:58.440 --> 2:05:03.560
 You're like, hey, we all experience being like a relative, like a mid level white belt

2:05:03.560 --> 2:05:07.880
 and being able to easily beat up all our friends because everyone wrestled other buddies. And it

2:05:07.880 --> 2:05:12.680
 was one of those ones where they don't have weapons to end the fight. You have weapons to end the

2:05:12.680 --> 2:05:21.560
 fight. That's such a crazy, you know, asymmetric advantage that if you lose, it's on you now,

2:05:21.560 --> 2:05:26.360
 man. Like you had the next time it's like, I've got this rifle and you have nothing. And I decide

2:05:26.360 --> 2:05:30.280
 to put it on my back and then run over and try to karate chop. You're like, okay, next time,

2:05:30.280 --> 2:05:33.400
 just make sure you use the rifle, bud. I'm like, oh yeah, I should do that.

2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:36.520
 Yeah, it's kind of fascinating. I mean, everything you're describing,

2:05:37.960 --> 2:05:41.640
 there's a fascinating tension between like whatever I show people for the first time,

2:05:41.640 --> 2:05:47.000
 what a triangle is, just like regular people. It's like they're discovering is like, oh, okay,

2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:50.840
 that's interesting. I mean, MMA has changed that, but people haven't watched MMA.

2:05:51.400 --> 2:05:56.760
 That's an interesting move. It doesn't make sense why that would be a joke. And they kind of quickly

2:05:56.760 --> 2:06:03.240
 accept that that's a thing. And they accept the basics without questioning, wait a minute,

2:06:03.240 --> 2:06:12.520
 what's actually being choked? How is it that a shoulder of a person can do the choking?

2:06:12.520 --> 2:06:16.680
 Like I'm not sure I fully question the fundamentals of all of that.

2:06:16.680 --> 2:06:23.160
 Like what exactly is the blood supply that's being cut off? Like what is the anatomy and the

2:06:23.160 --> 2:06:26.920
 physiology of all of that? Why does this work? And if you understood all that, what else can we do

2:06:26.920 --> 2:06:31.480
 here? Yeah, what else can we do here? That's the really important thing. But if I'm an end user,

2:06:31.480 --> 2:06:35.080
 which almost everyone is of almost anything, I'm serious, where I'm like, I think about

2:06:35.080 --> 2:06:38.600
 stuff in my life, the only things I really think about are like martial arts and martial arts

2:06:38.600 --> 2:06:44.120
 strategy and like, I don't know, some other couple of things, but not much. And anything else in my

2:06:44.120 --> 2:06:48.120
 life is borderline unexamined. And I like to think that if I put a lot of effort in something,

2:06:48.120 --> 2:06:51.640
 I'd like to think that I could figure at least some things out about it. But I figured out almost

2:06:51.640 --> 2:06:56.600
 nothing about anything in my life because I haven't even looked. And, you know, if you're an end user,

2:06:56.600 --> 2:07:02.200
 what are you capable of versus you can literally alter the source code? You are Neo in the freaking

2:07:02.200 --> 2:07:08.440
 matrix. If you could alter the code and I can't. And it's like, we think, ah, but imagine you are

2:07:08.440 --> 2:07:12.840
 a world class, anything, or you're not even world class, forget it, like a purple belt compared

2:07:12.840 --> 2:07:16.760
 to a white belt or compared to a no belt might as well be John Jones or Marcelo Garcia, you're

2:07:16.760 --> 2:07:22.040
 gonna beat them up comparably bad. So it's a that's that actually is a common thing where people

2:07:22.040 --> 2:07:24.600
 can't tell the difference in levels. They're like, Oh man, I've trained with my black belt

2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:29.080
 instructor, how much better could someone so be like, so much better, you're gonna have a hard

2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:32.680
 time wrapping your head around it. I remember when I first trained with Marcelo Garcia in 2007,

2:07:32.680 --> 2:07:37.640
 I was a decent purple belt. And of course, you mollywap me very gently. And then training them

2:07:37.640 --> 2:07:42.920
 again in 2008, I was definitely better. I won the G and no G worlds that you're purple belt.

2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:45.960
 So definitely for the record, I'm definitely not a jujitsu world champion. I wanted the purple

2:07:45.960 --> 2:07:50.680
 belt, but like, that's not the same at winning a black belt. And tough accomplishment, but not

2:07:50.680 --> 2:07:55.720
 in the same thing at all. But anyway, I was definitely better. He beat me up just the same.

2:07:56.360 --> 2:08:03.080
 Okay, 2009, I was a lot better, got a medal at ADCC that time, won the trials, crushed everybody,

2:08:03.080 --> 2:08:07.560
 like no, just submitted everybody like that. But but but but train more cellar Garcia,

2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:16.360
 it was worse. And 2010 train more cellar Garcia, same same. So the idea was, I wouldn't be able

2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:20.760
 to tell you the difference and the outcome difference was the same in all of these rounds. I

2:08:20.760 --> 2:08:25.240
 was significantly more experienced and more more adept each time, each time that this occurred.

2:08:25.240 --> 2:08:28.840
 But it was like, how many number of times did this person submit your pasture garden around?

2:08:28.840 --> 2:08:32.760
 I'm like, I don't know, probably like, let's say five each one, because it's a brief period of time.

2:08:32.760 --> 2:08:35.880
 And let's say it was three on one, six on another, whatever, it's comparable. It's six,

2:08:35.880 --> 2:08:41.720
 one half dozen. Would I be able to easily tell the difference? No, I would just say I know in

2:08:41.720 --> 2:08:45.880
 concept that he's way better. So much better. But there's plenty of other people that could

2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:49.800
 have beaten me just as bad as Marcelo did when I was a purple belt, or when I was a brown belt,

2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:54.200
 that maybe I would watch Marcelo walk through like their borderline not there. So it's neat,

2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:58.280
 like if you that's back to kind of what I was talking about, about certain people beginning

2:08:58.280 --> 2:09:03.720
 to really like peel back some of what's really special about the martial arts or any activity,

2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:09.160
 I presume, is they get to a level of understanding and depth that they're playing with like the

2:09:09.160 --> 2:09:15.080
 almost the reality of that thing. And I'm playing by rules that are not rules. I'm not I'm not even

2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:19.160
 one of the use of matrix analogy. I'm not even an agent, which is the best version of something

2:09:19.160 --> 2:09:24.280
 playing by the rules. Yes. I'm like one of the regular people or one of the regular people in

2:09:24.280 --> 2:09:27.480
 that got out of the matrix. So I'm like, Oh, I'm cool. But when I fight an agent, I lose.

2:09:28.120 --> 2:09:31.400
 It's because we're both in the rules, but they just play them to the play them to the bone,

2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:36.040
 and I'm just here. Well, and then the agent encounters Neo and they can do nothing. You're

2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:40.040
 like, Why? Because operating outside of what the rules are, but not really what the rules are,

2:09:40.040 --> 2:09:43.720
 what they perceive to be the rules are clearly. So anyway, I guess that's kind of my point about

2:09:43.720 --> 2:09:47.160
 Marcello or certain other people that are doing things we go, that doesn't even seem real.

2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:52.040
 It doesn't seem real to me because I don't understand what's going on. And I guess if we

2:09:52.040 --> 2:09:56.600
 can get down to base assumptions, like if we can constantly strip away, strip away, strip away,

2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:00.120
 let's say we always thought that turning left was right, it was correct. And it turns out that

2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:05.960
 turning right was correct. Change your life. Yeah. It's a, what is it? Socrates said the

2:10:05.960 --> 2:10:11.800
 unexamined life is not worth living. So you just basically have to rigorously just constantly examine

2:10:11.800 --> 2:10:15.800
 every assumption over and over and over. But doesn't that give your life meaning

2:10:15.800 --> 2:10:19.000
 to come back to the struggle, to come back to free will, to come back to what if we

2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:22.600
 could strip all that away? All right, cool. All right, let me just stick the needle in my arm

2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:29.240
 and that's that. Yeah. No, I mean that constant striving for understanding

2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:37.720
 yet another lower layer of the simulation we're living in is something that's actually deeply

2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:41.800
 fulfilling that I don't know if it's genetically built in, but there's something about that

2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:45.640
 striving to understand that seems to be deeply human.

2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:49.480
 It's funny, what makes us human? We don't talk about the soul anymore, man. I went to

2:10:49.480 --> 2:10:53.080
 Catholic school as a kid. Whether you buy into all that stuff or not, you're like,

2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:58.040
 what about the soul of a person, the spirit of a people, the spirit of a nation,

2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:02.760
 anywhere, the spirit of humanity? We don't, we don't, we talk about everything like it's this

2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:07.240
 quantifiable thing when maybe certain things are, maybe everything is. But then what happens if

2:11:07.240 --> 2:11:12.360
 there's things that just aren't quantifiable, that nothing in our understanding can or will

2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:14.920
 ever explain it? That doesn't mean that that should be our assumption. It's for your assumption

2:11:14.920 --> 2:11:18.200
 that we can explain everything and let's get to the dang bottom, peel, peel, peel, peel, peel.

2:11:18.200 --> 2:11:25.400
 But what if there is actually something that we need challenge for and we could be looking in

2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:29.480
 the wrong place by going, oh, is it in the genes? Maybe it is. Again, I'm not saying we're looking

2:11:29.480 --> 2:11:33.400
 in the wrong place like I wouldn't know anything. I do karate, but basically, not even well.

2:11:33.400 --> 2:11:40.200
 But yeah, do karate, mediocre, just ask Raymond Daniels or Steven Thompson. But I guess to come

2:11:40.200 --> 2:11:44.280
 back though, you just. Are you a yo about yo? Man, I actually have, do you ever see the,

2:11:44.280 --> 2:11:48.840
 yeah, Seinfeld episode where Kramer fights the kids? Yeah, I did that at Raymond Daniels school

2:11:48.840 --> 2:11:55.720
 under the kids, kids one in class as in addition to the alleyway. Oh, they finished it off afterwards.

2:11:55.720 --> 2:12:02.120
 Yeah, exactly when I was on my last legs. But yeah, I would just, maybe it's funny,

2:12:02.120 --> 2:12:07.400
 I feel like there's something deeply missing from public understanding anymore that it's almost

2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:12.440
 like the idea that we can figure everything out, which I deeply believe in, but also the possibility

2:12:12.440 --> 2:12:15.880
 that there's some things that we'll never really see and some things we'll never understand. And

2:12:15.880 --> 2:12:21.240
 there's something, like you said, uniquely human about the human experience that even if I had

2:12:21.240 --> 2:12:27.240
 the power to change, I don't want to fuck with it, man. I don't want to change that thing. Oh,

2:12:27.240 --> 2:12:31.160
 yeah. Well, wouldn't it be great if we just immediately knew the outcome of everything and

2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:34.840
 you just press this button, you know, like, what's the point of living life then? Even if you could

2:12:34.840 --> 2:12:37.480
 do it, it's the, Ian, you're seeing Jurassic, well, I'll leave you be sorry, I don't know what I'm

2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:43.960
 talking about. Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park, Jeff Goldblum, right? Life finds a way. But we were

2:12:43.960 --> 2:12:48.120
 so concerned with whether or not we could, we didn't stop to think whether or not we should.

2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:56.520
 Maybe? I think there's, I mean, it's a deeply human thing, but it's also a really useful thing to

2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:02.440
 always kind of assume that there's this giant thing that you don't understand. So you can forever

2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:09.240
 be striving to understand. Because that process gives you meaning, but also keeps making you

2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:14.120
 better. Like thinking that actually even just thinking that you can't understand everything

2:13:15.320 --> 2:13:24.280
 will lead you to stop too early. So like, I think there's something to, whether it's the soul or

2:13:24.280 --> 2:13:29.320
 whether it's like religious stuff, like assuming that there's this thing that you cannot possibly

2:13:29.320 --> 2:13:34.840
 understand is a really good assumption under which to operate and under which to do this first

2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:38.920
 principles kind of thinking, because you can just keep digging and keep digging and keep digging,

2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:41.960
 even when it seems like you're at the bottom, because you don't fucking know if you're at the

2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:46.760
 bottom or not. And back to your original, back to one of our, I guess, our other kind of tangents

2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:52.360
 was that comes back to everyone's a human being, the smartest human being in the history of humanity

2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:57.640
 is so hilariously weak, like short lived and not intelligent.

2:13:57.640 --> 2:13:58.520
 Do you agree with yourself, bro?

2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:01.720
 I understand. I didn't say, no, I'm not saying comparison to me. And comparison to me,

2:14:01.720 --> 2:14:05.640
 everyone is awesome. But that's why I don't do the goat thing. But basically,

2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:11.720
 it's just on a cosmic level. Can you imagine even if you were a vampire, you're like 900 years old,

2:14:11.720 --> 2:14:16.600
 like how much you would seem, you would seem like a lowercase g god to people. You'd be like,

2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:21.240
 how could you know so much? How can you have such a long view perspective? It would be insane.

2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:25.160
 So, I mean, that seems like we're talking about AI now, right? We're creating things

2:14:25.160 --> 2:14:29.080
 that are infinitely smarter than us effectively and live all this time. And it's probably going

2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:34.280
 to do what we tell us to do, right? No, it's probably, well, I hope it keeps us around.

2:14:34.280 --> 2:14:40.520
 Do you, by the way, think about AI and the existential threats? Like, speaking of gods,

2:14:40.520 --> 2:14:46.280
 IU is this whole technological world, we talked about social networks and this

2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:52.120
 increasing power of technology around us, we ourselves are becoming less human because we're

2:14:53.960 --> 2:14:59.400
 keep relying on technology more and more. So, we're becoming kinds of cyborgs. But also,

2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:07.880
 there's a future that's quite possible where the technology becomes smarter and more powerful than

2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:15.960
 us humans and, you know, starts having a life of its own in ways that perhaps we don't imagine

2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:21.160
 as human beings. I don't just mean, like, two legged robots walking around and being humans

2:15:21.160 --> 2:15:33.480
 but smarter. I mean, like, an intelligent life that's beyond and fundamentally different than

2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:38.760
 our human life. It's infinite, it's... Also, we're creating a new species, yeah?

2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:44.120
 Yeah, a new kind of species, not even just a new species. We're talking about systems, but, like,

2:15:44.120 --> 2:15:51.080
 it lives in a space of information. It lives in a different time scale and a different scale of

2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:58.040
 also a spatial scale. It operate, like, we spoke about individuals. It doesn't operate in the sense

2:15:58.040 --> 2:16:04.200
 of a single individual. Like, it's not embodied. So, it's not like a thing that walks around and

2:16:04.200 --> 2:16:10.840
 it, like, it looks at stuff and it consumes the world. It's able to do much larger scale sensing

2:16:10.840 --> 2:16:16.680
 of the environment around it, all that kind of stuff. I can barely even try to... I can barely

2:16:16.680 --> 2:16:22.840
 conceive of what that would be like. Are you scared or are you excited? I don't define scared or

2:16:22.840 --> 2:16:28.280
 excited. I feel like I tend to define them, like, the same way or I'm like... I guess I...

2:16:28.280 --> 2:16:33.800
 Kind of like when before karaoke, it's the same. Well, that's actually kind of my happy place.

2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:37.800
 It's not so much everyone else's. You know, it's everyone else is probably, you know,

2:16:37.800 --> 2:16:42.360
 heading for the door at that point. But, you know, it's... While you're doing it or leading up to

2:16:42.360 --> 2:16:46.840
 the karaoke session. Well, it depends whether or not they know it's me. If they know it's me,

2:16:46.840 --> 2:16:50.680
 that's before I start. If they're like, who's that guy? Then they're like halfway through the song

2:16:50.680 --> 2:16:55.400
 they're already throwing their beer. What categories of song or particular song are we talking about

2:16:55.400 --> 2:16:58.920
 in terms of like your happy place? Oh, man, are you kidding me? I mean, obviously, we hate me in

2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:01.880
 Rhapsody. I mean, there's no question because... Really? Oh, yeah, because I don't have to sing

2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:05.240
 it here. It's that. It's like, you remember, can I be... Can I be... Of course, is he here? No?

2:17:05.240 --> 2:17:09.480
 Yeah, then yeah. Yeah. All right. If you hear it, no, then I can. I have a torn... I have a...

2:17:10.200 --> 2:17:14.440
 I have torn feelings about the human raps. Because I like the beginning part, the sadness. I like

2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:19.480
 the solo, the heartbreak. But the second part, I understand it, but it's so ridiculous. It gets

2:17:19.480 --> 2:17:23.480
 ridiculous. It's so ridiculous. It ruins it for me. But it's more about flexing on people. I think

2:17:23.480 --> 2:17:29.720
 if you can actually hit that, hit that, you know, the falsetto. Yeah. So it's... It's not...

2:17:29.720 --> 2:17:34.360
 Okay. So you appreciate it not for the musical beauty and complexity of the song. You just like

2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:37.880
 to flex on people. Well, because like for all... Yeah, like what's the purpose of anything,

2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:40.760
 except for just to let everyone know that you think you're cool.

2:17:43.400 --> 2:17:47.240
 And there's no better way of doing that than karaoke. So I'm not sure why about karaoke.

2:17:47.240 --> 2:17:51.400
 Captive audience. Yeah, exactly. Oh, about hearing excitement of artificial intelligence.

2:17:51.400 --> 2:17:56.440
 I mean, like, you know me, I don't know anything about. I just... Basically, I don't understand

2:17:56.440 --> 2:18:01.400
 the implications of any of this. I would just say that like, radically altering what it means to be

2:18:01.400 --> 2:18:06.360
 human in such an unbelievably short period of time just seems like such a crazy thing. And also,

2:18:06.360 --> 2:18:09.560
 it's not like we're... I can't remember who said this to me or reason. It might have been me. I

2:18:09.560 --> 2:18:15.480
 can't remember. So this is definitely not my idea. But we're not even going, hey, would you like to

2:18:15.480 --> 2:18:21.880
 opt in everyone? Everyone is being opted in. And particularly when you want to talk about

2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:27.000
 like large scale robotics or large scale AI, like the world is changing. People in Senegal are

2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:30.600
 opting in right now without realizing it. It's not even like in the end. I don't mean to pick on

2:18:30.600 --> 2:18:33.880
 Senegal. It's just whatever country comes up to mind, but that's in the developing world. But

2:18:33.880 --> 2:18:42.600
 basically, recognizing that this huge shift is coming, we have no idea. This is a decent idea.

2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:47.960
 And also, something else I've always been considered is, you think about most of the really

2:18:47.960 --> 2:18:53.640
 awful, awful, awful things that have done in history, large scale slavery, you name it.

2:18:54.920 --> 2:18:59.240
 People say that it came from this motivation or that motivation. Maybe it did. Maybe it did.

2:18:59.240 --> 2:19:02.040
 And fundamentally, the issue, at least in my mind, and I'm not a historian,

2:19:02.760 --> 2:19:10.040
 power differential. If you and I can't contend, we don't contend. It's not like we fight and you

2:19:10.040 --> 2:19:15.800
 might win or we fight. Even you'll win comfortably. You are so unbelievably powerful compared to me

2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:20.680
 that there's nothing I can do to stop you. That seems like a recipe for something really,

2:19:20.680 --> 2:19:26.280
 really not great happening. Because if you think about like European countries encountering each

2:19:26.280 --> 2:19:28.680
 other, and I'm just speculating, I don't know anything about history, but let's say countries

2:19:28.680 --> 2:19:35.400
 that can contend with one another versus countries that can't. Let's say an alien

2:19:35.400 --> 2:19:39.560
 species, alien race shows up right now. We don't want that. I think Stephen Hawking said that.

2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:44.200
 That makes perfect sense to me. We don't want that. If you can come here, we better hope you're

2:19:44.200 --> 2:19:47.880
 nice. What are we going to do? What are we going to hope that you invade the water planet like

2:19:47.880 --> 2:19:53.560
 they did in the war of the world? So I guess what I'm trying to get across is like,

2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:59.560
 shocking levels of power differential between groups makes the world ripe for horrific abuse

2:19:59.560 --> 2:20:04.360
 in the event that someone decides to do it. It's like you imagine an adult hitting a child,

2:20:04.360 --> 2:20:07.240
 like hitting, hitting a child. No one in their right mind would ever go like, oh yeah, that's a

2:20:07.240 --> 2:20:13.640
 great idea. Because it's so grossly imbalanced. You're like, this is wrong. But it's also on the

2:20:13.640 --> 2:20:18.760
 table only because of the gross imbalance. So I guess to come back, it's like, whether we create

2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:26.920
 AI and it's on some crazy level of its own or it's, I'm in charge of it. It seems like we're

2:20:26.920 --> 2:20:33.000
 creating, you mentioned like a game theory and nuclear war. What prevented nuclear war? I mean,

2:20:33.960 --> 2:20:38.920
 presumably mutually assured destruction. I mean, hopefully also humanity and the humanity and the

2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:44.520
 reasonable cooler heads prevailing and going, hey, I can understand the veil of ignorance and I

2:20:44.520 --> 2:20:49.960
 don't go, oh yeah, let me kill those guys because I can't go, this is wrong period. And in concept,

2:20:49.960 --> 2:20:54.440
 this is not an action I should take. But it's also nice and easy to keep me honest if I know that

2:20:54.440 --> 2:21:00.200
 I can't get you without being got myself. But what happens when I can get anyone, anything,

2:21:00.840 --> 2:21:06.680
 and I'm more or less untouchable? That seems to me to be like various times in colonial history,

2:21:06.680 --> 2:21:09.400
 you know what I mean? And what happened? We know what happened.

2:21:09.400 --> 2:21:19.480
 But so the possibility of really bad things are plentiful possibilities. But the possibilities of

2:21:19.480 --> 2:21:22.920
 really positive things are plentiful. Like what though? I'm not saying wrong.

2:21:23.640 --> 2:21:28.840
 So I can give a million examples. One is just the examples of the parent and the child.

2:21:30.200 --> 2:21:38.440
 You said there's a power differential there. And we don't like a parent hitting their child.

2:21:38.440 --> 2:21:40.760
 What about not just hitting like beating?

2:21:41.960 --> 2:21:49.000
 Great. Beating their child. How often percentage wise do you see that happening?

2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:55.640
 Even though that power differential, first of all, other people's kids, let's just put this on

2:21:55.640 --> 2:22:01.000
 the table. I love kids, but others people's kids can be annoying sometimes. Sometimes you got to

2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:06.520
 deal out some justice. I get it. But we don't practice. We don't take advantage of that power

2:22:06.520 --> 2:22:13.640
 differential. So like there is ethics, there's moralities that emerge that allow the power

2:22:13.640 --> 2:22:20.200
 differential to be used for good versus for bad. So like you're one of the assumptions with Stephen

2:22:20.200 --> 2:22:25.960
 Hawking or with if Russia became much more powerful than America or America much more

2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:31.000
 powerful than Russia in the Cold War, your assumption that immediately that power differential,

2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:38.040
 not your assumption, would express itself in the same way that it was trying to express

2:22:38.040 --> 2:22:43.320
 itself when there was a more level competition. But it's also possible when the power differential

2:22:43.320 --> 2:22:50.760
 grows, the incentive, the joy, whatever the mechanisms that made sense when it was at the

2:22:50.760 --> 2:22:56.840
 same level, the incentives become very different. It's not as fun to destroy the ant colony.

2:22:56.840 --> 2:23:03.320
 You start becoming more a conservationist. One hopes. That's an evolved perspective,

2:23:03.320 --> 2:23:07.640
 though, yeah? I don't know if it's evolved or not, but it's definitely a possibility. It's

2:23:07.640 --> 2:23:11.880
 unclear to me that something that's many orders of magnitude more powerful than us

2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:18.680
 will want to destroy us. I mean, how did mass slavery occur? How did

2:23:18.680 --> 2:23:27.000
 it just big dogs playing with not? I think slavery and a lot of the atrocities

2:23:27.800 --> 2:23:35.080
 in history happened when the power differential was not as great as we're talking about with AI

2:23:35.080 --> 2:23:40.360
 potentially. Is that not somehow worse than? It's not obvious to me. It's not obvious that

2:23:40.360 --> 2:23:43.880
 things that are way more powerful. That's true. Okay.

2:23:43.880 --> 2:23:49.800
 So, I guess how do you restrain it, though? There's a lot of different discussions of how to...

2:23:51.160 --> 2:23:54.040
 I guess even restrain each other because let's say I go and decide to strike someone's child,

2:23:54.040 --> 2:23:58.600
 which I'd like to think I wouldn't do. I will be promptly, I will find myself in front of a judge.

2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:03.320
 So, I feel like there's a lot... Can you imagine how many people used to get murdered

2:24:03.320 --> 2:24:10.600
 just in the woods? I mean, I would just presume it's a lot. I don't think most people are lunatics

2:24:10.600 --> 2:24:13.800
 like that, but I would just say... But that's the point. If you're given though, if you're given to

2:24:13.800 --> 2:24:18.760
 that, your ability to get away with it was greater in the past because of chance of detection was

2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:23.800
 less. So, I don't know. You're going to be reasonable. This is what's called an artificial

2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:31.080
 intelligence, AI safety research called value alignment of ensuring as you build the systems

2:24:31.080 --> 2:24:36.280
 that become smarter and smarter, more powerful and powerful, make sure that their values are aligned

2:24:36.280 --> 2:24:42.200
 with the entities over which they're becoming powerful with humans. So, if you were to talk to

2:24:42.200 --> 2:24:46.520
 an AI that's becoming smarter versus dumber than you, that's becoming smarter and smarter,

2:24:47.320 --> 2:24:52.520
 you have to create mechanisms where you both value the same things.

2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:57.480
 I guess one thing I wonder... So, I guess I'm probably not sharp enough to grasp this,

2:24:57.480 --> 2:25:04.840
 if I'm honest, but I guess I wonder... I use the chess programs. It was deep blue, stock fish,

2:25:04.840 --> 2:25:11.960
 and then AlphaZero and AlphaZero teaching itself to beat stock fish without any help in four hours.

2:25:12.680 --> 2:25:16.120
 It becomes orders of magnitude more intelligence than us,

2:25:16.120 --> 2:25:22.520
 in effectively an instantaneous period. I guess I always wondered if you were that much smarter

2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:27.400
 than me, I feel like your ability to manipulate me would be pretty significant, or at least

2:25:27.400 --> 2:25:36.760
 potentially. But manipulation implies that the incentive is to overpower everything around you.

2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:46.840
 There's implied incentives. If your value is to actually... It depends what you want in life,

2:25:47.640 --> 2:25:53.960
 what you want in your system. It's not clear that the goal of an AI system that's all powerful

2:25:53.960 --> 2:25:58.040
 is to destroy all humans. No, I don't think that it is either. I guess what I'm...

2:25:58.040 --> 2:26:02.440
 Or even enslave all humans. That's fair. I guess what I'm trying to suggest is that

2:26:03.080 --> 2:26:06.440
 something adequately powerful, these actions are on the table.

2:26:06.440 --> 2:26:09.960
 Yes, they're on the table and that's scary, and that's why a lot of people are really concerned

2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:16.200
 about it and are working on it. I'm just trying to make the case for AGI, because if they're watching

2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:25.480
 this, he's the one to kill. No, actually, I was thinking I was... Yeah, I watched toilets really

2:26:25.480 --> 2:26:32.440
 well. No, I mean, that's the main concern for all the people in the AI state of research.

2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:40.920
 People talk about AGI's. It's kind of disturbing how little people are working on

2:26:40.920 --> 2:26:47.480
 trying to create mechanisms that keep AI's values aligned with ours.

2:26:48.120 --> 2:26:49.560
 That's completely unshocking.

2:26:50.520 --> 2:27:01.400
 Yeah, we humans seem to do only good when... Even look at coronavirus, the water has to

2:27:01.400 --> 2:27:07.800
 be leaking from the ceiling. You have to be... There has a lot everywhere, fire, just destruction.

2:27:07.800 --> 2:27:12.520
 We just seem to ignore completely any trouble.

2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:13.880
 Writing all over the wall?

2:27:13.880 --> 2:27:16.120
 Writing all over the wall. This is fine.

2:27:16.120 --> 2:27:19.080
 Yeah, I'm sure nothing to see here will be okay.

2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:23.560
 But we do all right, especially in the United States. You figure out, even when it becomes

2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:29.080
 a really serious problem, taking actions last minute, there's something about the innovative

2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:35.160
 spirit that results in a solution last minute, right before the deadline.

2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:38.600
 It works out. Well, I mean, I don't know how you did school, probably a lot better than me.

2:27:38.600 --> 2:27:40.280
 That's exactly how I did school.

2:27:40.280 --> 2:27:43.320
 I couldn't be more... I was no motivation up until the last... If you're like,

2:27:43.320 --> 2:27:47.720
 we have 22 hours to do the entire semesters of work, let's do this.

2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:48.120
 Yeah.

2:27:48.120 --> 2:27:50.520
 And you had 19 freaking mountain do's and then...

2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:51.560
 Yeah.

2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:56.440
 Well, that's why you and I are failures in life, because I just talked to... I mentioned Cal Newport

2:27:58.200 --> 2:28:03.480
 with his book, Deep Work and so on. He is of the variety of these creatures that

2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:12.440
 basically does everything ahead of time, that's shocking, because he thinks it's unproductive

2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:20.280
 to experience the stress and anxiety of the deadline, because you're not going to be your

2:28:20.280 --> 2:28:24.680
 best performance wise and you're not going to do the best work. So it doesn't make any...

2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:30.040
 It's completely irrational to have a function based on the deadline. You should have a system,

2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:35.880
 a process that gets stuff a little bit of stuff done every day. You should be and constantly be

2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:41.160
 systematically honest with yourself. If you say, I'm going to get this stuff done today and this

2:28:41.160 --> 2:28:45.320
 week, at the end of the day, at the end of the week, you have to then reflect on what you did,

2:28:45.320 --> 2:28:50.440
 who you planned and improve that plan, update it constantly, update every day, every week,

2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:55.800
 every quarter, whatever those durations are. As I'm listening to this and reading his stuff,

2:28:55.800 --> 2:29:01.160
 it's like, yeah, I grew with everything. I'm like, yes, I'm clapping. But the reality is,

2:29:01.160 --> 2:29:05.880
 and then I go back and just eat Cheetos and don't do shit until like last minute.

2:29:05.880 --> 2:29:06.520
 You didn't mention being cheesy.

2:29:10.040 --> 2:29:14.440
 Actually, I don't eat Cheetos. But actually, again, not that it'll ever matter,

2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:17.720
 not that it's ever going to matter because he's so shockingly productive and well thought out

2:29:17.720 --> 2:29:21.640
 that whatever I've decided to think about trying to monkey wrench in there is definitely

2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:24.920
 going to be able to deal with. But it's funny that, again, because you're a human being,

2:29:24.920 --> 2:29:29.400
 not a God, all of your strengths are your have a corresponding weakness. The less you practice

2:29:29.400 --> 2:29:33.240
 working under the gun, the less comfortable you are working under the gun, the more practice you

2:29:33.240 --> 2:29:36.280
 have working under the gun, the better you get at it. The downside is you're always working

2:29:36.280 --> 2:29:39.960
 under the gun so you're less productive or it's like your work quality maybe drops.

2:29:39.960 --> 2:29:43.880
 So it's an interesting thing. It's almost like, hey, I wonder if this, I wonder if

2:29:43.880 --> 2:29:47.560
 Khabib Nurmagomedov has a lot of heart and I say the answer is almost certainly yes.

2:29:47.560 --> 2:29:51.640
 But you go, well, he hasn't struggled a bunch. Maybe he doesn't struggle well and it just so

2:29:51.640 --> 2:29:54.680
 happens that he can also work under the gun really well. He just doesn't like to do it.

2:29:54.680 --> 2:29:58.200
 But yeah, but it's an interesting thing. It's like, I guess, what is it, the aerosol,

2:29:58.200 --> 2:30:01.960
 we are what we repeatedly do. We are all practicing something all the time.

2:30:02.760 --> 2:30:07.160
 So I guess it's funny. I guess that's a question I have though. I would love to ask him. It'd be

2:30:07.160 --> 2:30:13.560
 really neat is certain jobs, I mean, obviously you want to have preparation always, always,

2:30:13.560 --> 2:30:19.720
 but certain things have like a degree of like entropy in the system. And you go, I need to

2:30:19.720 --> 2:30:23.560
 practice working under the gun. I'm not saying that's what I need to do because fighting it

2:30:23.560 --> 2:30:26.920
 should be for the most part, it's a really sterile environment in the grand scheme of things like

2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:31.960
 fighting in a cage is very sterile compared to most other things in life, right? But dangerous,

2:30:31.960 --> 2:30:37.320
 but sterile. And unless of course, like, you know, like the other guy, the ref decides to hit you,

2:30:37.320 --> 2:30:42.360
 should be hilarious. But anyway, I guess just going like, okay, so at what value do you get

2:30:42.360 --> 2:30:47.720
 out of adding a degree of, let's say you could even be planned by someone else, but

2:30:48.920 --> 2:30:52.200
 junk in the system and you just have to work under the gun to make it happen. Let's say,

2:30:52.200 --> 2:30:57.160
 for instance, for like police or something like that, the situation turns left hard at some random

2:30:57.160 --> 2:31:00.840
 point in time. And that could happen to any number of people. So I guess it's interesting,

2:31:00.840 --> 2:31:05.320
 things that allow for perfect planning or quasi perfect planning versus things that are inherently

2:31:05.320 --> 2:31:10.520
 unstable. And then what are the, what's the psychological fallout of comfort with that?

2:31:10.520 --> 2:31:12.760
 Because I think a lot of people that are really comfortable under the gun,

2:31:14.280 --> 2:31:17.240
 let it happen a lot for all the good and the bad of that. Does that make sense?

2:31:17.240 --> 2:31:22.920
 No, that totally makes sense. And it was, I mean, his answer would be that you have to be honest

2:31:22.920 --> 2:31:29.800
 with yourself if it's valuable for your success to practice being under the gun. And then you

2:31:29.800 --> 2:31:35.640
 should schedule that. You should plan that. You should systematically, and then as opposed to

2:31:35.640 --> 2:31:41.960
 doing it half assily, because it's as opposed to letting the environment choose the randomness,

2:31:41.960 --> 2:31:48.280
 like control the randomness to where you optimize it. It's so efficient. It's shocking just to

2:31:48.280 --> 2:31:53.560
 hear about it. Yeah. No, he's, I mean, the same way you are, he's annoying in the same way,

2:31:53.560 --> 2:32:00.360
 which is like he drops truth bombs. It's like, yeah, yeah, that's so true. Yeah, we're probably

2:32:00.360 --> 2:32:08.120
 comparably doing that. No, he does. But he's, so he, his profession requires that. So he's not

2:32:08.120 --> 2:32:13.720
 just like a motivational speaker or whatever. He, he's a computer scientist, theoretical computer

2:32:13.720 --> 2:32:20.600
 scientist. And he needs the long hours in the day of doing like serious math. So it's mostly math

2:32:20.600 --> 2:32:26.520
 proofs. And for that, you have to sit and think really deeply. It's like really hard work compared

2:32:26.520 --> 2:32:32.600
 to like, what most people do, like, even what I mean, what I do, like programming is way easier

2:32:32.600 --> 2:32:38.360
 than rigorous math proofs. Cause you have to basically have this machine and you have to

2:32:39.480 --> 2:32:46.600
 your brain to turn out logic in a focused way while visualizing a bunch of things and holding

2:32:46.600 --> 2:32:51.880
 that in your brain and holding that for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, hopefully several hours.

2:32:52.520 --> 2:32:57.480
 And you're not just like doing homework. You're doing totally novel stuff. So like stuff that

2:32:57.480 --> 2:33:02.280
 nobody's ever done before. So you keep running up against the wall of like, fuck, this is a

2:33:02.280 --> 2:33:09.000
 dead end. Oh no, wait, is this a dead end? And like that whole frustration, that's serious mental

2:33:09.000 --> 2:33:12.600
 work. That's like incredibly difficult mental work. So he knows what he's talking about.

2:33:12.600 --> 2:33:17.240
 That's amazing. I mean, like you said, he's like, this seems like the standard for the quality of

2:33:17.240 --> 2:33:22.360
 work that he needs is so high, so high that almost anything less than this level of systematization

2:33:22.360 --> 2:33:26.680
 and organization would preclude it, right? So he can't afford the kind of bullshit that I don't

2:33:26.680 --> 2:33:30.600
 know about you, but that the certain thing I do, which is like last deadline kind of stuff,

2:33:30.600 --> 2:33:37.720
 because you can't do that kind of work last minute on deadline kind of stuff. So my question for

2:33:37.720 --> 2:33:44.040
 human general is like, and for you and I is like, well, here's these negative patterns that we do

2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:52.440
 of like doing shit last minute and so on. Is this just who we are now? Or are there some?

2:33:52.440 --> 2:33:56.360
 I don't think I'm really big into free will. You know, I was thinking that it's mostly

2:33:56.360 --> 2:34:01.800
 predestination, at least in this regard. It's the same with like communism, like as long as it fits

2:34:01.800 --> 2:34:07.000
 my whatever is the lazy thing to do, I'll just not believe in free will. Yeah, I'm not a commencement

2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:15.720
 opportunist or that's when that was. I'm an opportunistic communist and capitalist. I just

2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:23.640
 do whatever, whatever is cool at the time. Exactly. Let me ask you to examine some fundamental

2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:28.840
 principles of a particular thing that Joe Rogan brought up to me several times online and offline,

2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:39.320
 which is that he thinks that the tie that I wear is something that makes me vulnerable

2:34:39.320 --> 2:34:45.400
 to attack that you should be, the reason he doesn't wear a tie is because he can get choked

2:34:45.400 --> 2:34:52.840
 very easily with the tie. It's a big concern. Okay. My contention, and by the way, he wore a suit

2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:57.000
 last time too. He didn't wear it on the podcast. He wore it for dinner later.

2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:01.400
 Yeah, I wore a suit the other day and I had no socks on. I didn't realize, yeah.

2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:03.640
 You're supposed to wear socks? Yeah, that's my understanding.

2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:11.000
 Why'd you wear a suit? Did you go to court? No, no. I don't know. I just wanted to play,

2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:18.200
 I wanted to pretend I was an adult for a day. Okay, cool. So my contention is like the jacket,

2:35:18.200 --> 2:35:23.880
 everything is more dangerous than a tie. That's kind of where I was going with that.

2:35:23.880 --> 2:35:27.320
 That's kind of where, yeah, this was my first thought too. Once the tie becomes an issue,

2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:31.320
 I feel like everything else is already an issue. It's already an issue, yeah.

2:35:31.320 --> 2:35:38.760
 Because the tie to me, now without messing with it now, to me has some of the similar problems

2:35:38.760 --> 2:35:43.240
 that a belt does. For example, I don't know about you, maybe you can correct me,

2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:51.800
 but I'm not sure you can use the belt as tied. I know there's some kind of

2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:58.600
 guards you can probably utilize the belt with, but the belt, sorry, when it's tied around the waist.

2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:01.240
 Then we're talking about a belt or a gi belt? Sorry, a gi belt.

2:36:01.240 --> 2:36:07.160
 Okay. Sorry, gi belt, importantly, gi belt. It's not that great of a thing to use

2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:18.200
 in most cases, I would say, because it slides. You can probably invent a few interesting ways

2:36:18.200 --> 2:36:23.880
 to use it as leverage, as control and so on, but there's just so many more things around

2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:28.600
 the belt that are better. And so for me, the tie, what people don't realize.

2:36:28.600 --> 2:36:32.600
 That's better. Are we trying to sell a DVD here and have some widgets and bells and whistles?

2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:35.320
 Because in that case, the belt is a really important part of what we do, and I would

2:36:35.320 --> 2:36:39.800
 really encourage you guys to look into it. If we're trying to actually learn something,

2:36:39.800 --> 2:36:42.520
 I'd say, like you said, we're surrounded by better options.

2:36:42.520 --> 2:36:47.320
 Well, that's the thing. It's not obvious to me that the belt, maybe there's actually

2:36:47.320 --> 2:36:52.200
 undiscovered things about using the belt. I think people have used, like putting a foot

2:36:52.200 --> 2:36:55.400
 inside the belt somehow, inside the gi belt, there's some...

2:36:55.400 --> 2:36:57.560
 Well, this is a no punches, gi grappling situation, yes?

2:36:57.560 --> 2:36:57.880
 Right.

2:36:57.880 --> 2:36:58.200
 Okay.

2:36:58.200 --> 2:36:58.760
 Yeah, I guess so.

2:36:58.760 --> 2:36:59.880
 It's sort of fairly contrived, right?

2:36:59.880 --> 2:37:04.120
 But with punches too, like is there, okay, let's talk about a street fight with a belt that's

2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:06.520
 like a jeans belt, like a belt, clothing belt.

2:37:06.520 --> 2:37:09.080
 Okay, so I get to take it off and whip them in the face of the buckle?

2:37:09.880 --> 2:37:12.760
 How serious is this street fight? Are we talking like that far in Oklahoma?

2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:13.080
 No, 100% serious.

2:37:13.080 --> 2:37:14.920
 Or are we talking like...

2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:17.160
 No, like death, like one of you has to die.

2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:18.040
 Oh, yikes, whoa.

2:37:18.040 --> 2:37:18.520
 Okay.

2:37:18.520 --> 2:37:20.760
 Oh, you ever, like...

2:37:20.760 --> 2:37:22.280
 I'm in this situation all the time.

2:37:24.280 --> 2:37:25.960
 And there's a reason I'm still here.

2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:26.440
 I had some...

2:37:27.400 --> 2:37:28.760
 I had someone try to fight me to Starbucks the other day.

2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:30.680
 I fight kids. We're talking about power differential.

2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:31.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:37:31.240 --> 2:37:32.280
 I beat up kids all the time.

2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:34.360
 Just pick the easy Ws. You got to get the easy Ws.

2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:35.160
 You want them to be horrible.

2:37:35.160 --> 2:37:36.280
 I'm undefeated.

2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:37.800
 Come around the playground, watch what happens.

2:37:37.800 --> 2:37:42.120
 No, like to the death, what is their clothing that's useful?

2:37:42.920 --> 2:37:44.520
 You know, from my perspective...

2:37:44.520 --> 2:37:46.040
 I mean, like for your use or their use?

2:37:46.680 --> 2:37:48.760
 Both, my use, their use.

2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:54.040
 No, like, I like how you want to take the belt off and use the buckle to hit them with.

2:37:54.040 --> 2:37:56.600
 But first of all, how are you going to take off like the belt?

2:37:56.600 --> 2:37:56.920
 Well, essentially...

2:37:56.920 --> 2:38:00.200
 There's a lot of effort involved in unclothing.

2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:03.960
 Well, what I was figuring was when they started to see me take my pants off in the fight,

2:38:03.960 --> 2:38:04.840
 they were like, what?

2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:07.640
 They're going to pause and rethink the situation for a second.

2:38:07.640 --> 2:38:07.960
 Yes.

2:38:07.960 --> 2:38:09.160
 And I'm making dead eye contact.

2:38:09.160 --> 2:38:10.360
 Obviously, this is going on.

2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:11.400
 Yeah, exactly.

2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:11.880
 Notting.

2:38:11.880 --> 2:38:15.640
 And then, you know, by the time they realized you took a belt off until you could whip them with it,

2:38:15.640 --> 2:38:18.680
 you actually, you're already won possibly two steps ahead.

2:38:18.680 --> 2:38:19.560
 Okay, so fine.

2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:21.000
 Let's not talk about your own clothing.

2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:21.800
 Let's talk about their clothing.

2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:23.480
 Okay, I'll take off their belt and hit them with it.

2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:25.240
 No, but that's, that's much harder.

2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:25.880
 No question.

2:38:25.880 --> 2:38:26.680
 But if you can do it...

2:38:26.680 --> 2:38:27.480
 Oh, I'm maintaining.

2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:27.800
 I got...

2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:28.440
 No, I just...

2:38:28.440 --> 2:38:30.920
 How do they come to this?

2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:36.200
 But the point is there's alternatives that are perhaps more effective.

2:38:36.200 --> 2:38:37.000
 Yeah.

2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:43.720
 In my perspective, this might be clueless, there's almost no clothing that's more effective than

2:38:43.720 --> 2:38:46.200
 almost assuming the situation is no ghee grappling.

2:38:46.840 --> 2:38:48.760
 Like, I feel like clothing...

2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:51.080
 Particularly when you start to add hitting.

2:38:51.080 --> 2:38:53.400
 Like every single time I start grabbing your clothes, if you start,

2:38:53.400 --> 2:38:55.000
 you start hitting and something, nothing could work.

2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:58.840
 But most of the time, you're like, why am I not using my arms for something better

2:38:58.840 --> 2:39:00.600
 than what I'm doing them right now?

2:39:00.600 --> 2:39:01.080
 Right.

2:39:01.080 --> 2:39:01.560
 Yeah.

2:39:01.560 --> 2:39:02.920
 It's very difficult for me to...

2:39:04.200 --> 2:39:08.680
 I don't know, in terms of just distance, I can't imagine a case of different distances,

2:39:08.680 --> 2:39:12.440
 even like situations where let's not talk about like,

2:39:13.480 --> 2:39:17.400
 like a situation where you haven't both yet agreed that a fight is happening.

2:39:18.680 --> 2:39:20.360
 Solid clothing is nice if they have it on then.

2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:21.960
 Solid clothing?

2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:23.480
 Oh yeah, like something like a good jacket,

2:39:23.480 --> 2:39:25.080
 because you can snatch somebody on their face.

2:39:25.080 --> 2:39:26.280
 Snatch down.

2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:27.880
 Yeah, you know, it's like, if you took my...

2:39:27.880 --> 2:39:31.960
 Like, you know, like you snap down in judo, like how easy it is to snap down a beginner?

2:39:31.960 --> 2:39:32.280
 Yeah.

2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:34.360
 So I agree with you.

2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:37.560
 Actually, a tie in that sense might be a really effective way to snap down.

2:39:37.560 --> 2:39:40.520
 So the snap down is really powerful to change the...

2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:45.880
 Like disorient at the situation and give you a lot of different opportunities for

2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:48.600
 you know, taking their back, taking them down.

2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:52.600
 Doing hilarious stuff, like snapping them down where they're tying to your knee.

2:39:52.600 --> 2:39:54.600
 And then when they come back up doing this and you're already...

2:39:55.240 --> 2:39:56.840
 So yeah, in that sense, I agree.

2:39:56.840 --> 2:40:00.360
 But not as a choking mechanism, because the concern Joe had is choke.

2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:03.400
 I think you probably choke me with your time more easily than I can choke you with your time.

2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:03.800
 Probably.

2:40:03.800 --> 2:40:08.200
 I'm serious, because like if you get my back and you can put it around somebody's neck,

2:40:08.200 --> 2:40:11.320
 you know, like you ever see a diehard?

2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:11.640
 Yeah.

2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:16.760
 Yeah, you remember when the super Swedish looking blonde dude or whatever was trying to choke Bruce

2:40:16.760 --> 2:40:18.840
 Willis with the chain?

2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:21.880
 Yeah, and then he ended up getting choked himself with the chain if I recall this properly.

2:40:21.880 --> 2:40:23.560
 But anyway, yeah, like that.

2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:25.160
 But I don't feel like...

2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:29.800
 I feel like if I start grabbing your tie, you have too many other great options.

2:40:29.800 --> 2:40:32.280
 I mean, I do like the snap down that you actually made me realize.

2:40:32.280 --> 2:40:33.880
 No, I think you have to be good there.

2:40:33.880 --> 2:40:34.200
 What's that?

2:40:34.200 --> 2:40:35.720
 I think you're on the right path with it.

2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:36.520
 With the snap down?

2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:39.560
 Yeah, particularly if you start with like one of these like, you know, like you like you

2:40:39.560 --> 2:40:41.640
 poach your finger in my chest and then snap down real quick.

2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:47.880
 Oh yeah, because it also socially speaking, it's not a threatening thing to, you know,

2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:50.840
 to reach for the tie that's not particularly like a business setting.

2:40:50.840 --> 2:40:52.760
 You never see it coming.

2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:57.480
 Yeah, because I was thinking choke, but it's a really good leverage point because like

2:40:57.480 --> 2:41:00.600
 grabbing a jacket, the jacket will slide if you try to snap down.

2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:03.240
 You really have to get a hold, like a really good hold.

2:41:03.240 --> 2:41:05.560
 That's a good point because it's around the back and then what if it's a clip on?

2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:06.920
 How much of a jackass would you look like?

2:41:06.920 --> 2:41:09.880
 You feel like, and then they just a sticky one.

2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:11.960
 But you ever see the Japanese politician?

2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:13.000
 I think it was Japan.

2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:13.720
 Do you know that or else?

2:41:13.720 --> 2:41:20.200
 Yeah, he was so common, cool, had like, it was every, it was beautiful technique.

2:41:20.200 --> 2:41:24.600
 The level of, actually the throw was even gentle, but yeah, it was perfect.

2:41:24.600 --> 2:41:25.000
 It was amazing.

2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:25.800
 Well executed.

2:41:25.800 --> 2:41:29.240
 Yeah, more of our politicians just toss the shit out of the show.

2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:30.600
 Yeah, we need more Teddy Roosevelt.

2:41:31.160 --> 2:41:31.560
 Exactly.

2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:34.440
 I like our politicians like talking about fighting when it's clear that none of them

2:41:34.440 --> 2:41:36.360
 have even, it would ever have been in the fight ever.

2:41:37.080 --> 2:41:39.320
 Yeah, somebody was saying Teddy Roosevelt is interesting.

2:41:39.320 --> 2:41:43.320
 I didn't realize this is he's one of the greatest presidents this country's had.

2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:49.080
 And he was one of the greatest presidents, even though he faced no crisis whatsoever.

2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:52.920
 He literally willed himself, like nothing happened during his presidency.

2:41:52.920 --> 2:41:56.520
 He's just a bad motherfucker who made really great speeches.

2:41:56.520 --> 2:41:56.840
 Yeah.

2:41:56.840 --> 2:42:02.040
 So he like, you know, this made me realize, I was just talking to my historian that like,

2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:07.400
 most of the people who we think are great need also a good crisis that they've,

2:42:07.400 --> 2:42:09.080
 that reveal their greatness.

2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:10.200
 Muhammad Ali, right?

2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:12.680
 This Muhammad Ali, I mean, in sports.

2:42:12.680 --> 2:42:15.240
 But, you know, I mean, like the circumstances, what is greatness?

2:42:15.240 --> 2:42:15.560
 You know what I mean?

2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:18.040
 It's like, you have to, it's not just your capacity.

2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:19.720
 It's what you, what you face, right?

2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:22.760
 So quality of opposition, circumstance, what you overcome.

2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:26.200
 So I guess what you're saying is Joe Rogan is wrong about the tie thing.

2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:28.680
 You know, I don't want to go so far as saying he's wrong.

2:42:28.680 --> 2:42:30.440
 I, you know, the man's not here to defend himself.

2:42:30.440 --> 2:42:32.280
 Maybe he has some things that I'm not understanding.

2:42:32.280 --> 2:42:32.840
 I'm willing to give up.

2:42:32.840 --> 2:42:34.200
 He has not deeply thought this.

2:42:34.200 --> 2:42:35.640
 This is my main criticism of Joe.

2:42:35.640 --> 2:42:37.160
 He's not deeply thought through this.

2:42:37.160 --> 2:42:39.240
 And the MMA journalists will be like,

2:42:39.240 --> 2:42:41.640
 Ryan Hall says Joe Rogan is wrong.

2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:42.680
 And hates ties.

2:42:42.680 --> 2:42:43.480
 And hates ties.

2:42:44.680 --> 2:42:47.240
 They'll integrate Hitler back in there somehow.

2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:48.360
 Oh, nice, nice.

2:42:48.360 --> 2:42:50.920
 What's, you're talking about greatness

2:42:51.880 --> 2:42:55.880
 and greatness requiring a difficult moment in time.

2:42:56.600 --> 2:43:00.680
 Can you like reflect back and think what are some of the hardest,

2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:03.000
 if not the hardest thing you've ever had to do in your life?

2:43:04.280 --> 2:43:06.760
 Well, you know, I think I've had a bunch of things.

2:43:06.760 --> 2:43:08.440
 You know, I've had a lot of things not go my way.

2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:10.680
 You know, I've been incredibly fortunate.

2:43:10.680 --> 2:43:12.520
 I've had a lot of things go my way also.

2:43:12.520 --> 2:43:17.480
 So, but leaving, leaving Team Lord Urban in 2008,

2:43:17.480 --> 2:43:20.440
 which I firmly believe was the right thing to do,

2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:25.320
 is one of the, that was very difficult at the time.

2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:26.920
 Not like, not a difficult choice,

2:43:26.920 --> 2:43:29.640
 but it was because of why I was leaving.

2:43:29.640 --> 2:43:31.560
 But psychologically.

2:43:31.560 --> 2:43:33.000
 First of all, loss in general,

2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:35.560
 leaving a team, a family of all kinds.

2:43:35.560 --> 2:43:37.240
 It doesn't matter what the circumstances.

2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:38.200
 I didn't lose any friends,

2:43:38.200 --> 2:43:40.200
 but I lost a lot of people I thought were my friends.

2:43:40.200 --> 2:43:42.360
 And I lost training.

2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:43.080
 I lost that.

2:43:43.080 --> 2:43:44.760
 I'd also had like a really serious,

2:43:44.760 --> 2:43:46.600
 my wrist only does that.

2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:50.600
 So like, I had a really serious wrist surgery,

2:43:50.600 --> 2:43:52.360
 like that I didn't know if I was going to be able to compete

2:43:52.360 --> 2:43:53.160
 anymore after that.

2:43:53.160 --> 2:43:54.280
 I just got my brown belt.

2:43:54.280 --> 2:43:56.440
 That was a, it was a tough time,

2:43:56.440 --> 2:43:58.760
 like psychologically, physically, everything,

2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:00.920
 but I was very, very motivated to do my best

2:44:00.920 --> 2:44:02.440
 and to push through it and to,

2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:04.760
 it was to carry on in a positive direction,

2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:06.680
 no matter what, in a different direction.

2:44:06.680 --> 2:44:08.680
 And we lonely.

2:44:08.680 --> 2:44:09.960
 This is the thing about family,

2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:11.480
 even if it's an abuse of family,

2:44:11.480 --> 2:44:13.400
 leaving, it's tough.

2:44:13.400 --> 2:44:14.760
 People are complicated.

2:44:14.760 --> 2:44:15.960
 And even people that I,

2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:17.560
 that I don't think very well of,

2:44:17.560 --> 2:44:18.760
 that I think on the whole,

2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:19.880
 I don't think very well of,

2:44:19.880 --> 2:44:23.000
 it's unfair to paint them with one brush.

2:44:24.120 --> 2:44:25.160
 You know, obviously there's greater

2:44:25.160 --> 2:44:26.760
 and lesser examples of that,

2:44:26.760 --> 2:44:28.280
 like the person we discussed last time,

2:44:28.280 --> 2:44:30.200
 who's an infinitely, you know,

2:44:30.200 --> 2:44:32.120
 beyond almost anyone that we could ever imagine

2:44:32.120 --> 2:44:33.560
 meeting in our own personal lives.

2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:34.040
 Yeah.

2:44:34.040 --> 2:44:34.360
 Yeah.

2:44:35.720 --> 2:44:36.360
 Bloody elbow.

2:44:36.360 --> 2:44:37.000
 Yeah.

2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:39.960
 In terms of forgiveness and hate,

2:44:39.960 --> 2:44:42.600
 I mean, do you have hate in your heart

2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:44.680
 for people in your past?

2:44:44.680 --> 2:44:44.920
 No.

2:44:44.920 --> 2:44:46.040
 For that process?

2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:46.520
 No.

2:44:46.520 --> 2:44:47.720
 I mean, there were definitely times

2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:49.480
 when I've been negatively motivated

2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:51.160
 to prove people wrong

2:44:51.160 --> 2:44:52.760
 or to accomplish things in spite.

2:44:52.760 --> 2:44:55.400
 And I think that some of that is valuable,

2:44:55.400 --> 2:44:57.160
 if I'm be lying, if I felt differently.

2:44:57.160 --> 2:45:00.360
 I think particularly I do really well in conflict.

2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:03.480
 I'm useless without the usual deadline thing.

2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:04.120
 I'm useless, yeah.

2:45:04.120 --> 2:45:05.160
 You like the chaos?

2:45:05.160 --> 2:45:06.120
 I'm useless, yeah, I do.

2:45:06.120 --> 2:45:07.640
 I'm useless without an antagonist.

2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:08.760
 I like fighting.

2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:10.360
 I like competition.

2:45:10.360 --> 2:45:11.400
 I like being pushed.

2:45:11.400 --> 2:45:13.160
 I like feeling like if I don't play well,

2:45:13.160 --> 2:45:13.800
 I'm going to get hurt.

2:45:14.760 --> 2:45:16.200
 I have no choice but to play well

2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:18.440
 or play with everything I got at the very least.

2:45:18.440 --> 2:45:19.800
 And I guess I would say, though,

2:45:19.800 --> 2:45:25.880
 as I've gotten more time and lived a little bit longer,

2:45:25.880 --> 2:45:34.200
 you see various situations with increased color,

2:45:34.200 --> 2:45:36.040
 I guess I would say, increased clarity.

2:45:36.040 --> 2:45:40.840
 And there are a lot of lessons to be learned

2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:43.480
 even from times in history or bad experience

2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:43.800
 that we have.

2:45:43.800 --> 2:45:45.400
 And the question is, can we take those lessons

2:45:45.400 --> 2:45:46.520
 and move forward?

2:45:46.520 --> 2:45:48.120
 And that's, again, what I think we're seeing

2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:49.960
 in sometimes socially right now.

2:45:49.960 --> 2:45:52.360
 We're forgetting important lessons of the past.

2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:53.640
 And that's not good.

2:45:53.640 --> 2:45:56.440
 Not saying, hey, I don't get why we could be going

2:45:56.440 --> 2:45:57.480
 in this direction or that.

2:45:57.480 --> 2:45:58.600
 I understand entirely.

2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:00.840
 But hey, let's not forget the lessons

2:46:00.840 --> 2:46:02.360
 so we don't have to learn them again

2:46:02.360 --> 2:46:04.920
 because that doesn't really serve anybody.

2:46:04.920 --> 2:46:06.520
 And anyway, I guess I would say I'm

2:46:06.520 --> 2:46:10.120
 thankful for all of the experiences difficult and otherwise.

2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:10.840
 Mostly difficult.

2:46:10.840 --> 2:46:12.360
 Honestly, most of the times I remember,

2:46:12.360 --> 2:46:14.040
 I'm thankful for every loss I've ever had,

2:46:14.040 --> 2:46:15.640
 particularly the tough ones.

2:46:15.640 --> 2:46:18.840
 I'm thankful for all the relationships.

2:46:18.840 --> 2:46:20.040
 Many people have taught me many things

2:46:20.040 --> 2:46:21.160
 and continue to teach me many things,

2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:23.000
 some of whom are still some of my closest friends,

2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:25.080
 some of whom are people I really don't get along with at all.

2:46:25.080 --> 2:46:29.000
 And some of whom are people I think really poorly of.

2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:30.680
 Oh, there's not many of that last group.

2:46:30.680 --> 2:46:34.600
 What I guess I would say is there's been a lot of things

2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:37.960
 and opportunities to learn throughout that.

2:46:37.960 --> 2:46:39.240
 And also, it's not as if I've never

2:46:39.240 --> 2:46:40.680
 done and made any mistakes myself.

2:46:40.680 --> 2:46:43.160
 Now, again, there are magnitude differences

2:46:43.160 --> 2:46:44.040
 I like to think.

2:46:44.040 --> 2:46:45.960
 And I can definitely say that none of the mistakes

2:46:45.960 --> 2:46:47.720
 that I've ever made have been mistakes of intention.

2:46:48.680 --> 2:46:50.040
 I've screwed up a lot of things in my life,

2:46:50.040 --> 2:46:52.520
 but I can confidently and easily say

2:46:52.520 --> 2:46:54.840
 that I've never had ill intent towards people

2:46:54.840 --> 2:46:55.400
 as I've done it.

2:46:55.400 --> 2:46:56.920
 So we sit there and like, man, it's just the right thing.

2:46:56.920 --> 2:46:57.400
 It's the right thing.

2:46:57.400 --> 2:46:58.200
 And sometimes I've been wrong.

2:46:58.920 --> 2:47:02.120
 But you never sit out with malicious intent.

2:47:02.120 --> 2:47:05.320
 And I think that when I find that I think people do things

2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:07.560
 differently, when I do think that there is malicious intent,

2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:08.920
 I have a difficult time forgiving that.

2:47:09.480 --> 2:47:14.120
 How does love win over hate, Ryan Hall, in this world?

2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:15.560
 We talk about social media.

2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:21.640
 We talk about forgiveness of some of the more complicated

2:47:21.640 --> 2:47:22.600
 people in your past.

2:47:24.280 --> 2:47:29.240
 If we scale that to the entire world before the AI destroys us

2:47:29.240 --> 2:47:33.240
 and though the human race is lost to history,

2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:35.720
 how do you think love wins over hate?

2:47:35.720 --> 2:47:37.640
 Well, I'd like to preface this by saying

2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:39.480
 I tried to make pancakes the other day.

2:47:39.480 --> 2:47:39.880
 Yes.

2:47:41.320 --> 2:47:41.880
 It didn't work.

2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:44.600
 But I'm happy to comment on this.

2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:52.440
 So basically, I think most of the times that I can think of

2:47:52.440 --> 2:47:57.720
 that I've struggled and the times that I've read about

2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:02.280
 is being unable to see the humanity in other people and also

2:48:02.280 --> 2:48:04.680
 even in sometimes our enemies and the people that have done

2:48:04.680 --> 2:48:05.320
 awful things.

2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:09.160
 And you go, what would allow people to do this, that,

2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:09.560
 or the other?

2:48:09.560 --> 2:48:11.720
 And that doesn't forgive what they've done,

2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:13.720
 depending upon some things are forgivable,

2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:14.840
 some things are less so.

2:48:14.840 --> 2:48:16.280
 But you want to understand why.

2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:19.320
 It's like, to our knowledge, demons don't populate our world.

2:48:19.320 --> 2:48:23.960
 Neither do literal angels walking around being actually perfect.

2:48:23.960 --> 2:48:27.080
 A lot of times, the things that I find it deeply amusing

2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:29.880
 watching people hoisted by their own batard on Twitter,

2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:32.200
 even though it's gross and it's really unproductive,

2:48:32.200 --> 2:48:34.920
 it's actually equal parts amusing and awful

2:48:34.920 --> 2:48:38.200
 because you're not happy that someone's being raked over the coals,

2:48:38.200 --> 2:48:39.720
 particularly unjustifiably.

2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:42.840
 But it is funny when it's the exact same thing.

2:48:42.840 --> 2:48:45.800
 They were raking others over the coals for not a week or two prior

2:48:45.800 --> 2:48:48.200
 and that's happened repeatedly and will continue to happen.

2:48:48.200 --> 2:48:52.280
 And I guess I would say, as you mentioned, a prior,

2:48:52.280 --> 2:48:55.480
 like a recognition of the humanity of others that all of us

2:48:55.480 --> 2:48:58.680
 make mistakes that it's difficult to understand intention.

2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:01.480
 I've had arguments with close friends of mine over text message

2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:03.800
 where both of us ended up super pissed

2:49:03.800 --> 2:49:06.200
 because we were completely misreading

2:49:06.200 --> 2:49:08.760
 what the tone, the intention of what the other person was doing.

2:49:08.760 --> 2:49:11.320
 And even if I was reading it correctly, which I wasn't,

2:49:11.320 --> 2:49:15.160
 it's so easy to ascribe the most negative possible,

2:49:16.200 --> 2:49:18.840
 the least charitable assessment of what they're doing.

2:49:18.840 --> 2:49:21.800
 And I think that that's such a dangerous way to live your life.

2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:24.360
 And it's also just a fruitless way to live your life.

2:49:24.360 --> 2:49:26.440
 It's one thing to go, hey, why did you do that?

2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:28.280
 I was pissed. What did you do?

2:49:28.280 --> 2:49:29.800
 You just, you did that to make yourself feel better

2:49:29.800 --> 2:49:31.240
 like your damn right I did.

2:49:31.240 --> 2:49:34.200
 And have I done that plenty of times in my life?

2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:35.880
 Yeah, I would lie if I said that I didn't.

2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:37.960
 You know, why did you punch that guy in the face?

2:49:37.960 --> 2:49:40.840
 He was going crazy at me and hit me and I asked him to stop.

2:49:40.840 --> 2:49:42.920
 And then I gave a warning and I'd put him on his ass.

2:49:42.920 --> 2:49:44.280
 I'm like, no, I'm not sorry.

2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:48.120
 But then looking back now with years to sit on and like,

2:49:48.120 --> 2:49:49.880
 do I understand why I did what I did?

2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:53.080
 Absolutely. Would I like to respond differently now?

2:49:53.080 --> 2:49:55.800
 Yeah, I would. And it doesn't mean that,

2:49:55.800 --> 2:49:59.080
 I think plenty of things that people do are understandable.

2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:01.800
 It doesn't mean understandable, doesn't mean correct.

2:50:01.800 --> 2:50:04.120
 Understandable doesn't mean that you go, oh, yeah, that's great.

2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:06.840
 You go, I could see someone doing such a thing.

2:50:07.720 --> 2:50:09.560
 But I guess just trying to understand

2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:11.080
 and see the humanity in others.

2:50:11.080 --> 2:50:12.760
 Because if I can't see the humanity in others,

2:50:12.760 --> 2:50:14.360
 how can I see it in myself?

2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:17.160
 And also, how am I meant to interact with everyone?

2:50:17.160 --> 2:50:20.440
 As you said, even if we're a society of individuals

2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:23.080
 for at least for the time being, hopefully, in perpetuity,

2:50:23.960 --> 2:50:25.720
 we still come together as a whole.

2:50:26.280 --> 2:50:28.520
 And watching, it's weird.

2:50:28.520 --> 2:50:31.080
 Like you said, if I only ask why once I start with,

2:50:32.120 --> 2:50:33.560
 stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours,

2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:34.520
 leave me the fuck alone.

2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:36.520
 You're like, okay, that's fine, Ryan.

2:50:36.520 --> 2:50:38.280
 But that's easy for you to say living in a society

2:50:38.280 --> 2:50:39.800
 that doesn't actually function like that.

2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:41.720
 So it's a little bit cheap.

2:50:41.720 --> 2:50:43.640
 But if I recognize that that's step one,

2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:45.160
 is I don't hurt you and you don't hurt me.

2:50:45.160 --> 2:50:46.920
 But then we go, but how can I help you?

2:50:46.920 --> 2:50:49.240
 That's step two, and then it goes way beyond that

2:50:49.240 --> 2:50:50.680
 and a lot further than I've thought about it.

2:50:50.680 --> 2:50:51.960
 But I guess what I would just say is, again,

2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:54.120
 recognition of the humanity in others,

2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:55.960
 and that we all have different strengths,

2:50:55.960 --> 2:50:57.080
 we all have different weaknesses.

2:50:57.080 --> 2:50:58.280
 And you can never really be sure

2:50:58.280 --> 2:50:59.240
 where the other person's coming from.

2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:00.920
 But if we approach things charitably,

2:51:00.920 --> 2:51:03.640
 as charitably as we would hope others would approach us,

2:51:04.440 --> 2:51:05.640
 I think we'll do a lot better.

2:51:05.640 --> 2:51:07.400
 And I guess one thing that I read that I liked

2:51:07.400 --> 2:51:09.800
 that I thought was accurate and unfortunately disappointing

2:51:09.800 --> 2:51:14.360
 was everyone is a great jury, a great lawyer for themselves

2:51:14.360 --> 2:51:15.640
 and a judge for others.

2:51:15.640 --> 2:51:17.560
 And I think that's a terrible way to live life.

2:51:17.560 --> 2:51:19.080
 Even if it's an understandable one.

2:51:19.080 --> 2:51:20.040
 I don't know.

2:51:20.040 --> 2:51:22.920
 I think probably flipping that is the right way to live.

2:51:22.920 --> 2:51:26.360
 Being constantly judgmental of yourself

2:51:26.360 --> 2:51:28.760
 and a defender of others.

2:51:28.760 --> 2:51:30.920
 And that results ultimately in the interaction

2:51:30.920 --> 2:51:33.880
 that deescalates versus escalates.

2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:37.160
 Right, and we can all live in a world like that.

2:51:37.160 --> 2:51:38.200
 And sometimes you're like,

2:51:38.200 --> 2:51:40.280
 hey, man, people that deserve punishment won't get it.

2:51:40.280 --> 2:51:41.640
 Like, okay, hey, but what do they say?

2:51:41.640 --> 2:51:43.720
 Better to have 10 guilty people go free

2:51:43.720 --> 2:51:46.360
 than one innocent person burn.

2:51:46.360 --> 2:51:49.800
 And ultimately, I think that is a better world

2:51:49.800 --> 2:51:51.000
 than the other way around.

2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:56.600
 And if all else fails, join the team that builds the AI

2:51:56.600 --> 2:51:57.800
 that kills all humans.

2:51:57.800 --> 2:51:58.600
 Yeah, obviously.

2:51:58.600 --> 2:52:00.600
 I mean, if you have to be on a team, pick the winning team.

2:52:00.600 --> 2:52:01.640
 That's been the...

2:52:01.640 --> 2:52:03.000
 That's my hiring pitch, actually.

2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:04.200
 It's a good hiring pitch.

2:52:04.200 --> 2:52:05.720
 You're still taking resumes?

2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:08.840
 You want to be on the team that doesn't die

2:52:08.840 --> 2:52:10.440
 during the great apocalypse.

2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:11.240
 Not immediately.

2:52:11.240 --> 2:52:12.040
 You want to be on the one

2:52:12.040 --> 2:52:15.800
 that's eventually long suffering and stepped on, right?

2:52:15.800 --> 2:52:17.960
 Yeah, life is suffering, Ryan Hall.

2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:20.040
 This was an amazing conversation.

2:52:20.040 --> 2:52:21.320
 I really enjoyed talking to you.

2:52:21.320 --> 2:52:23.160
 I could probably talk to you for many more hours.

2:52:23.160 --> 2:52:25.080
 I hope I do as well.

2:52:25.080 --> 2:52:26.760
 Ryan, I love you, buddy.

2:52:26.760 --> 2:52:27.880
 This was a great conversation.

2:52:27.880 --> 2:52:28.840
 Thanks for talking to me.

2:52:28.840 --> 2:52:29.720
 Thank you so much, Ryan.

2:52:29.720 --> 2:52:31.320
 I really appreciate it.

2:52:31.320 --> 2:52:34.040

 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:52:50.520 --> 2:52:53.320
 from Frank Herbert in Dune.

2:52:53.320 --> 2:52:55.000
 I must not fear.

2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:57.160
 Fear is the mind killer.

2:52:57.160 --> 2:53:01.000
 Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.

2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:02.760
 I will face my fear.

2:53:02.760 --> 2:53:05.720
 I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

2:53:05.720 --> 2:53:07.400
 And when it has gone past,

2:53:07.400 --> 2:53:10.600
 I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

2:53:10.600 --> 2:53:14.200
 Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing.

2:53:14.200 --> 2:53:16.680
 Only I will remain.

2:53:16.680 --> 2:53:38.200
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
