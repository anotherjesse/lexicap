00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
 The following is a conversation with Luiz and Joao Batala, brothers and cofounders of Fermat's

00:06.320 --> 00:12.800
 library, which is an incredible platform for annotating papers. Is there right on the Fermat's

00:12.800 --> 00:18.640
 library website? Justice Pierre de Fermat scribbled his famous last theorem in the margins.

00:18.640 --> 00:23.600
 Professional scientists, academics, and citizen scientists can annotate equations, figures,

00:23.600 --> 00:30.640
 ideas, and write in the margins. Fermat's library is also a really good Twitter account to follow.

00:30.640 --> 00:37.120
 I highly recommend it. They post little visual factoids and explorations that reveal the beauty of

00:37.120 --> 00:46.000
 mathematics. I love it. Quick mention of our sponsors. Skiff, Simply Safe, Indeed, Nutsuite,

00:46.000 --> 00:50.880
 and FourSigmatic. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.280
 As a side note, let me say a few words about the dissemination of scientific ideas.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.720
 I believe that all scientific articles should be freely accessible to the public.

01:01.440 --> 01:07.520
 They currently are not. In one analysis I saw, more than 70% of published research articles are

01:07.520 --> 01:13.280
 behind a paywall. In case you don't know, the funders of the research, whether that's government

01:13.280 --> 01:19.200
 or industry, aren't the ones putting up the paywall. The journals are the ones putting up the

01:19.200 --> 01:24.480
 paywall, while using unpaid labor from researchers for the peer review process.

01:25.520 --> 01:31.520
 Where is all that money from the paywall going? In this digital age, the costs here should be

01:31.520 --> 01:37.520
 minimal. This cost can easily be covered through donation, advertisement, or public funding of

01:37.520 --> 01:43.120
 science. The benefit versus the cost of all papers being free to read is obvious, and the fact that

01:43.120 --> 01:48.640
 they're not free goes against everything science should stand for, which is the free dissemination

01:48.640 --> 01:56.560
 of ideas that educate and inspire. Science cannot be a gated institution. The more people can freely

01:56.560 --> 02:02.240
 learn and collaborate on ideas, the more problems we can solve in the world together, and the faster

02:02.240 --> 02:09.600
 we can drive old ideas out and bring new, better ideas in. Science is beautiful and powerful,

02:10.160 --> 02:17.200
 and its dissemination in this digital age should be free. This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

02:17.200 --> 02:21.120
 and here's my conversation with Louise and Joao Batalla.

02:22.320 --> 02:29.760
 Louise, you suggested an interesting idea. Imagine if most papers had a backstory section,

02:29.760 --> 02:36.080
 the same way that they have an abstract. Knowing more about how the authors ended up

02:36.080 --> 02:40.880
 working on a paper can be extremely insightful, and then you went on to give a backstory for

02:40.880 --> 02:45.520
 the Feynman QED paper. This is all on the tweet, by the way. We're doing tweet analysis today.

02:45.520 --> 02:49.760
 Okay. How much of the human backstory do you think is important in understanding

02:50.400 --> 02:53.680
 the idea itself that's presented in the paper or in general?

02:54.240 --> 03:00.800
 I think this gives way more context to the work of scientists. A lot of people have this

03:00.800 --> 03:07.680
 almost kind of romantic misconception that the way a lot of scientists work is almost as the sum

03:07.680 --> 03:13.200
 of eureka moments where all of a sudden they sit down and start writing two papers in a row,

03:13.200 --> 03:18.000
 and the papers are usually isolated. When you actually look at it, the papers are

03:18.640 --> 03:26.480
 chapters of a way more complex story. The Feynman QED paper is a good example. Feynman was actually

03:26.480 --> 03:33.600
 going through a pretty dark phase before writing that paper. He lost enthusiasm with physics and

03:33.600 --> 03:39.440
 doing physics problems. There was one time when he was in the cafeteria of Cornell and he saw a

03:39.440 --> 03:44.640
 guy that was throwing plates in the air. He noticed that when the plate was in the air,

03:44.640 --> 03:49.680
 there were two movements there. The plate was wobbling, but he also noticed that the Cornell

03:49.680 --> 03:55.600
 symbol was rotating. He was able to figure out the equations of motions, the equations of motions

03:55.600 --> 04:04.720
 of those plates. That led him to kind of think a little bit about electron orbits in relativity,

04:04.720 --> 04:13.360
 which led to the paper about quantum electrodynamics. That kind of reignited his interest in physics

04:15.040 --> 04:22.480
 and ended up publishing the paper that led to his Nobel Prize, basically. I think there are a lot

04:22.480 --> 04:26.480
 of really interesting backstories about papers that readers never get to know. For instance,

04:26.480 --> 04:35.920
 we did a couple of months ago an AMA around a pretty famous paper, The Gams Paper with Ian

04:35.920 --> 04:41.840
 Goodfellow. We did an AMA where everyone could ask questions about the paper and Ian was

04:41.840 --> 04:47.680
 responding to those questions. He was also telling the story of how he got the idea for that paper

04:47.680 --> 04:57.600
 in a bar. There was also an interesting backstory. I also read a book by Cedric Vellani. Cedric

04:57.600 --> 05:02.880
 Vellani is this mathematician, a Fields Medalist. In his book, he tries to explain how he got from

05:04.160 --> 05:09.440
 a PhD student to the Fields Medal. He tries to be as descriptive as possible about every single

05:09.440 --> 05:14.480
 step how he got to the Fields Medal. It's interesting also to see just the amount of

05:14.480 --> 05:19.600
 random interactions and discussions with other researchers sometimes over coffee and how it

05:19.600 --> 05:24.960
 led to fundamental breakthroughs and some of his most important papers. I think it's super

05:24.960 --> 05:30.000
 interesting to have that context of the backstory. Well, the Ian Goodfellow story is kind of interesting

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
 and perhaps that's true for Feynman as well. I don't know if it's romanticizing the thing, but

05:34.720 --> 05:41.520
 it seems like just a few little insights and a little bit of work does most of the leap required.

05:41.520 --> 05:46.720
 Do you have a sense for a lot of the stuff you've looked at just looking back through history?

05:48.560 --> 05:53.760
 It wasn't necessarily the grind of like Andrew Wiles or the Fermat's last theorem,

05:53.760 --> 05:59.760
 for example. It was more like a brilliant moment of insight. In fact, Ian Goodfellow

05:59.760 --> 06:04.960
 has a kind of sadness to him almost in that at that time in machine learning,

06:04.960 --> 06:12.880
 like at that time, especially in for GANs, you could code something up really quickly in a single

06:12.880 --> 06:20.800
 machine and almost do the invention, go from idea to experimental validation in like a single night,

06:20.800 --> 06:25.440
 a single person could do it. And now there's kind of a sadness that a lot of the breakthroughs you

06:25.440 --> 06:30.640
 might have in machine learning kind of require large scale experiments. So it was almost like

06:30.640 --> 06:39.520
 the early days. So I wonder how many low hanging fruit there are in science and mathematics and

06:39.520 --> 06:44.960
 even engineering where it's like you could do that little experiment quickly. Like you have an

06:44.960 --> 06:51.040
 insight in a bar. Why is it always a bar? But you have an insight at a bar and then just implement

06:51.040 --> 06:57.760
 and the world changes. It's a good point. I think it also depends a lot on the maturity of the field.

06:57.760 --> 07:03.520
 When you look at a field like mathematics, like it's a pretty mature field, a field like machine

07:03.520 --> 07:11.360
 learning, it's growing pretty fast. And it's actually pretty interesting. I looked up like the

07:11.360 --> 07:19.120
 number of new papers on archive with the keyword machine learning. And like 50% of those papers

07:19.120 --> 07:26.320
 have been published in the last 12 months. So you can see just the sense, 50, 50%. So you can see

07:26.320 --> 07:33.920
 the magnitude of growth in that field. And so I think like as fields mature, like those types of

07:33.920 --> 07:41.840
 moments, I think naturally are less frequent. It's just a consequence of that. The other point

07:41.840 --> 07:46.640
 that is interesting about the backstory is that it can really make it more memorable in a way.

07:46.640 --> 07:51.520
 And by making it more memorable, it kind of sediments the knowledge more in your mind. I

07:51.520 --> 08:00.640
 remember also reading the backstory to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, where he came up with it

08:01.200 --> 08:08.000
 essentially while he was sitting down at a coffee shop in Amsterdam. And he came up with that

08:08.000 --> 08:12.800
 algorithm over 20 minutes. And one interesting aspect is that he didn't have any pen or paper

08:12.800 --> 08:17.200
 at the time. And so he had to do it all in his mind. And so there's only so much complexity

08:17.200 --> 08:22.000
 that he can handle if you're just thinking about it in your mind. And that when you think about

08:22.000 --> 08:29.200
 the simplicity of Dijkstra's shortest path finding algorithm, it's knowing that backstory helps

08:29.200 --> 08:33.280
 sediment that algorithm in your mind so that you don't forget about it as easily.

08:33.280 --> 08:41.280
 It might be from you that I saw a meme about Dijkstra. It's like he's trying to solve it and

08:41.280 --> 08:45.840
 he comes up with some kind of random path. And then it's like my parents aren't home. And then he

08:45.840 --> 08:54.160
 does, he figures out the algorithm for the shortest path. It's right through words to convey memes,

08:54.160 --> 09:00.000
 but it's hilarious. I don't know if it's in post that we construct stories that romanticize it.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.440
 Apparently with Newton, there was no Apple, especially when you're working on problems that

09:05.440 --> 09:12.560
 have a physical manifestation or a visual manifestation. It feels like the world could be

09:12.560 --> 09:20.000
 an inspiration to you. So it doesn't have to be completely on paper. Like you could be sitting

09:20.000 --> 09:26.160
 at a bar and all of a sudden see something and a pattern will spark another pattern and you can

09:26.160 --> 09:32.320
 visualize it and rethink a problem in a particular way. Of course, you can also load the math that

09:32.320 --> 09:36.240
 you have on paper and always carry that with you. So when you show up to the bar, some little

09:36.240 --> 09:42.960
 inspiration could be the thing that changes it. Is there any other people almost on the human side,

09:42.960 --> 09:50.240
 whether it's physics with Feynman, Dirac, Einstein, or computer science, touring anybody else,

09:50.240 --> 09:54.560
 any backstories that you remember that jump out? Because I'm also referring to

09:55.760 --> 10:01.040
 not necessarily these stories where something magical happens, but these are personalities.

10:01.040 --> 10:07.200
 They have big egos. Some of them are super friendly. Some of them are self obsessed. Some

10:07.200 --> 10:14.080
 of them have anger issues. Some of them, how do I describe Feynman? But he appears to have

10:15.280 --> 10:20.560
 appreciation of the beautiful in all its forms. He has a wit and a cleverness and a humor about

10:20.560 --> 10:25.040
 him. Does that come into play in terms of the construction of the science?

10:25.920 --> 10:30.480
 I think you brought up Newton. Newton is a good example also to think about his back story,

10:30.480 --> 10:36.000
 because there's a certain back story of Newton that people always talk about. But then there's a

10:36.000 --> 10:42.240
 whole another aspect of him that is also a big part of the person that he was, but he was really

10:42.240 --> 10:49.280
 into alchemy. He spent a lot of time thinking about that and writing about it. He took it very

10:49.280 --> 10:55.120
 seriously. He was really into Bible interpretation, trying to predict things based on the Bible.

10:55.120 --> 10:59.520
 And so there's also a whole back story then. And of course, you need to look at it in the context

10:59.520 --> 11:07.280
 that and the time that when Newton lived, but it adds to his personality. And it's important to

11:07.280 --> 11:14.800
 also understand those aspects that maybe people are not as proud to teach to little kids, but

11:14.800 --> 11:19.600
 it's important. It was part of who he was. And maybe without those, who knows what he would

11:19.600 --> 11:26.080
 have done otherwise. Well, the cool thing about alchemy, I don't know how it was viewed at the

11:26.080 --> 11:35.120
 time, but it almost like to me symbolizes dreaming of the impossible. Most of the breakthrough ideas

11:35.120 --> 11:39.920
 kind of seem impossible until they're actually done. It's like achieving human flight. It's not

11:39.920 --> 11:46.160
 completely obvious to me that alchemy is impossible or like putting myself in the mindset of the time.

11:47.120 --> 11:53.440
 And perhaps even still, everything that some of the most incredible breakthroughs

11:53.440 --> 12:03.200
 are would seem impossible. And I wonder the value of believing, almost like focusing and dreaming

12:03.200 --> 12:09.200
 of the impossible such that it is actually is possible in your mind and that in itself manifests

12:10.400 --> 12:16.800
 whether the accomplishing that goal or making progress in some unexpected direction. So alchemy

12:16.800 --> 12:21.680
 almost symbolizes that for me. I distinctly remember having the same thought of thinking,

12:21.680 --> 12:25.600
 you know, when I learned about atoms and that they have protons and electrons, I was like,

12:25.600 --> 12:30.160
 okay, to make gold, you just take whatever has an atomic weight below it and then shove another

12:30.160 --> 12:34.080
 proton in there, and then you have a bunch of gold. So like, why don't people do that?

12:34.640 --> 12:39.280
 It seemed like conceptually is like, you know, this sounds feasible. You might be able to do it.

12:39.280 --> 12:44.240
 And you can actually just very, very expensive. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. So in a sense,

12:44.240 --> 12:49.520
 we do have alchemy. And maybe even back then, it wasn't as crazy that he was so into it.

12:49.520 --> 12:55.120
 But good people just don't like to talk about that as much. Yeah, but Newton in general was a very

12:55.120 --> 13:03.200
 interesting fella. Anybody else come to mind? In terms of people that inspire you, in terms of

13:03.200 --> 13:08.560
 people that you just are happy that they have once or still exist on this earth?

13:09.680 --> 13:16.960
 I think, I mean, Freeman Dyson for me. Yeah, Freeman Dyson was, I've had a chance to actually

13:16.960 --> 13:21.200
 exchange a couple of emails with him. He was probably one of the most humble scientists that

13:21.200 --> 13:29.040
 I've ever met. And that had a big impact on me. We're actually trying to convince him to annotate

13:29.040 --> 13:36.560
 a paper on Fermat's library. And I sent him an email asking him if he could annotate a paper.

13:36.560 --> 13:42.240
 And his response was something like, I have very limited knowledge. I just know a couple of things

13:42.240 --> 13:47.760
 about certain fields. I'm not sure if I'm qualified to do that. That was his first response.

13:47.760 --> 13:52.880
 And this was someone that should have won a Nobel Prize and worked on a bunch of different fields,

13:53.600 --> 13:58.880
 did some really, really great work. And then just the interactions that I had with him,

13:58.880 --> 14:05.200
 every time I asked him a couple of questions about his papers, and he always responded saying,

14:05.200 --> 14:13.040
 I'm not here to answer your questions. I just want to open up more questions. And so that had a big

14:13.040 --> 14:21.600
 impact on me. It's like just an example of an extremely humble yet accomplished scientist.

14:21.600 --> 14:27.600
 And Feynman was also a big, big inspiration in the sense that he was able to be, you know,

14:27.600 --> 14:33.200
 again, extremely talented and scientist. But at the same time, socially, he was able to,

14:33.200 --> 14:39.520
 he was also really smart from a social perspective. And he was able to interact with people. It was

14:39.520 --> 14:48.160
 also a really good teacher. And it was also to did a awesome work in terms of explaining physics

14:48.160 --> 14:53.920
 to the masses and motivating and getting people interested in physics. And that for me was also

14:53.920 --> 14:58.880
 big inspiration. Yeah, I like the child like curiosity. Some of those folks like you mentioned

14:58.880 --> 15:04.560
 Feynman. I've, Daniel Kahneman, I got a chance to meet and interact with some of these truly

15:04.560 --> 15:12.000
 special scientists. What makes them special is that even in older age, they're still like,

15:12.000 --> 15:18.560
 there's still that fire of childlike curiosity that burns. And some of that is like, not taking

15:18.560 --> 15:23.200
 yourself so seriously that you think you've figured it all out, but almost like thinking that you

15:23.200 --> 15:32.880
 don't know much of it. And that's like step one in having a great conversation or collaboration

15:32.880 --> 15:38.640
 or exploring a scientific question. And it's cool how the very thing that probably earned people the

15:38.640 --> 15:46.640
 Nobel Prize or work that's seminal in some way is the very thing that still burns even after

15:47.760 --> 15:52.560
 they've won the prize. It's cool to see. And they're rare humans, it seems.

15:52.560 --> 15:56.800
 And to that point, I remember like the last email that I sent to Freeman Dyson was like in his

15:56.800 --> 16:03.280
 last birthday, he was really into number theory and primes. So what I did is I took like a photo

16:03.280 --> 16:10.320
 of him picture and then I turned that into like a giant prime number. So I converted the picture

16:10.320 --> 16:16.000
 into a bunch of one and eights. And then I moved some numbers around until it was a prime. And then

16:16.000 --> 16:21.280
 I sent him that. Oh, so the the visual like it still looked like the picture. It's made up of a

16:21.280 --> 16:27.280
 prime. That's tricky to do. It's hard to do. It looks harder than it actually is. So the way you

16:27.280 --> 16:32.400
 do it is like you convert the darker regions into eights and the lighter regions in once.

16:33.040 --> 16:39.680
 And then there's just keep flipping. Yeah. But there's like some primality tests that are cheaper

16:39.680 --> 16:46.240
 from a computational standpoint. But what he tells you is it excludes numbers that are not prime.

16:46.240 --> 16:49.600
 Then you end up with a set of numbers that you don't know if they are prime or not.

16:49.600 --> 16:54.960
 And then you run the full primality test on that. So you just have to keep iterating on that. And

16:54.960 --> 16:59.440
 it was it was it's funny because when he got the picture, he was like, how did you do that? It was

16:59.440 --> 17:04.320
 super curious too. And then we got into the details. And again, these was he was already 90,

17:04.320 --> 17:12.400
 I think 92 or something. And that curiosity was still there. So you can really see that in some

17:12.400 --> 17:19.920
 of these scientists. So could we talk about Fermat's library? Yeah, absolutely. What is it?

17:19.920 --> 17:26.160
 What's the main goal? What's the dream? It is a platform for annotating papers in its essence.

17:26.160 --> 17:33.040
 Right. And so academic papers can be one of the densest forms of content out there. And generally

17:33.040 --> 17:39.040
 pretty hard to understand at times. And the idea is that you can make them more accessible and

17:39.040 --> 17:44.400
 easier to understand by adding these rich annotations to the site, right? And so we can just imagine

17:44.400 --> 17:48.240
 a PDF view on your browser, and then you have annotations on each side. And then when you click

17:48.240 --> 17:53.600
 on them, a sidebar expands, and then you have annotations that support late tech and markdown.

17:54.160 --> 17:59.680
 And so the idea is that you can, say, explain a tougher part of a paper where there's a step

17:59.680 --> 18:06.800
 that is not completely obvious, or you can add more context to it. And then over time, papers can

18:06.800 --> 18:12.640
 become easier and easier to understand and can evolve in a way. But it really came from

18:13.600 --> 18:20.000
 myself, Luis and two other friends. We've had this long running habit of kind of running a journal

18:20.000 --> 18:25.120
 club amongst us. We come from different backgrounds, right? I studied CS, we studied physics. And so

18:25.120 --> 18:32.320
 we read papers and present them to each other. And then we try to bring some of that online.

18:32.320 --> 18:40.480
 And that's when we decided to build Fermat's library. Then over time, it kind of grew into

18:42.080 --> 18:48.480
 something with a broader goal. And really, what we're trying to do is trying to help

18:49.360 --> 18:55.200
 move science in the right direction. That's really the ultimate goal and where we want to take it

18:55.200 --> 19:01.600
 now. So there's a lot to be said. So first of all, for people who haven't seen it, the interface

19:01.600 --> 19:06.880
 is exceptionally well done. That's like execution is really important here. Absolutely. The other

19:06.880 --> 19:12.960
 thing is just to mention, for a large number of people, apparently, which is new to me,

19:12.960 --> 19:19.600
 don't know what latex is. So it's spelled like latex. So be careful Googling it if you haven't

19:19.600 --> 19:25.520
 before. It's a, sorry, I don't even know the correct terminology setting language. It's a

19:25.520 --> 19:32.240
 typesetting language where it's you're basically program writing a program that then generates

19:32.960 --> 19:40.000
 something that looks from a typography perspective beautiful. Absolutely. And so a lot of academics

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
 use it to write papers. I think there's like a bunch of communities that use it to write papers.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.880
 I would say it's mathematics, physics, computer science. Yeah, that's yeah. That's because I'm

19:52.880 --> 19:58.000
 collaborating currently on a paper with two neuroscientists from Stanford. And they don't know

19:58.000 --> 20:08.880
 what. So I'm using Microsoft Word and Mendeley and like all of those kinds of things. And I'm

20:08.880 --> 20:15.040
 being very zen like about the whole process. But it's fascinating. It's a little heartbreaking,

20:15.040 --> 20:23.040
 actually, because it actually, it's funny to say, but we'll talk about open science, actually,

20:23.040 --> 20:28.000
 the bigger mission behind Fermat's library is like really opening up the world of science to

20:28.000 --> 20:36.720
 everybody. Is these silly two facts of like one community uses latex and another uses word

20:37.600 --> 20:43.680
 is actually a barrier between them. That's like, it's like boring and practical in a sense, but

20:43.680 --> 20:49.040
 this makes it very difficult to collaborate. Just on that, like I think that if there are some people

20:49.040 --> 20:53.600
 that should have received like a Nobel Prize that but will never get it. And I think one of those

20:53.600 --> 20:59.840
 is like Donald Knuth because of tech and latex and then because it had a huge impact in terms of

20:59.840 --> 21:06.480
 like just making it easier for researchers to put their content out there, like making it uniform

21:06.480 --> 21:11.760
 as much as possible. Oh, you mean like a Nobel Peace Prize? Maybe a Nobel Peace Prize.

21:11.760 --> 21:19.920
 Maybe a Nobel Peace Prize. I think so. I mean, he at a very young age got the Turing Award for

21:19.920 --> 21:25.760
 his work in algorithms and so on. So like an incredibly, I think it's in, it might be even

21:25.760 --> 21:30.800
 the 60s, but I think it's the 70s. So when he was really young, and then he went on to do like

21:30.800 --> 21:38.400
 incredible work with his book and yeah, with tech that people don't know. And going back just on

21:38.400 --> 21:42.800
 the reason why we ended up, because I think this is interesting, the reason why we ended up using

21:42.800 --> 21:48.560
 the name Fermat's Library, this was because of Fermat's last theorem. And Fermat's last theorem

21:48.560 --> 21:55.760
 is actually a funny story. So Pierre de Fermat, he was like a lawyer and he wrote like on a book

21:56.480 --> 22:03.520
 that he had a solution to Fermat's last theorem, which but that didn't fit the margin of that book.

22:03.520 --> 22:09.600
 And so Fermat's last theorem basically states that there's no solution. If you have integers a,

22:09.600 --> 22:14.960
 b and c, there's no solution to a to the power of n plus b to the power of n equals to c to the

22:14.960 --> 22:24.560
 power of n if n is bigger than 2. So there's no solutions. And he said that and that problem

22:24.560 --> 22:30.880
 remained open for almost 300 years, I believe. And a lot of the most famous mathematicians

22:30.880 --> 22:35.280
 tried to tackle that problem. No one was able to figure that out until Andrew Wiles,

22:36.560 --> 22:41.760
 I think was in the 90s, was able to publish the solution, which was I believe almost 300 pages

22:41.760 --> 22:49.920
 long. And so it's kind of an anecdote that there's a lot of knowledge and insights that can be

22:49.920 --> 22:55.680
 trapped in the margins, that there's a lot of potential energy that you can release if you

22:55.680 --> 23:02.080
 can release, if you actually spend some time trying to digest that. And that was the origin

23:02.080 --> 23:07.840
 story for the name. Yeah, you can share the contents of the margins with the world that could

23:07.840 --> 23:14.080
 inspire a solution or communication that then leads to a solution. And if you think about

23:14.080 --> 23:18.960
 papers, like papers are as Jean was saying, probably one of the densest pieces of text that

23:18.960 --> 23:24.480
 any human can read. And you have these researchers, like some of the brightest minds in this field

23:24.480 --> 23:30.400
 working on like new discoveries and publishing these work on journals that are imposing them

23:30.400 --> 23:35.440
 restrictions in terms of the number of pages that they can have to explain a new scientific

23:35.440 --> 23:42.720
 breakthrough. So at the end of the day, papers are not optimized for clarity and for a proper

23:42.720 --> 23:48.560
 explanation of that content, because there are so many restrictions. So there's, as I mentioned,

23:48.560 --> 23:54.800
 there's a lot of potential energy that can be freed if you actually try to digest a lot of the

23:54.800 --> 24:01.600
 contents of papers. Can you explain some of the other things, so margins, librarian, journal club?

24:01.600 --> 24:07.360
 So journal club is what a lot of people know us for, where every week we release an annotated

24:07.360 --> 24:13.520
 paper in all sorts of different fields, but physics, CS, math. Margins is kind of the same

24:13.520 --> 24:19.200
 software that we use to run the journal club and to host the annotations. But we've made that available

24:19.200 --> 24:27.440
 for free to anybody that wants to use it. And so folks use it at universities and for running

24:27.440 --> 24:33.760
 journal clubs. And so we've just made that freely available. And then librarian is a browser extension

24:33.760 --> 24:38.880
 that we developed that is sort of an overlay on top of archive. So it's about bringing some of the

24:38.880 --> 24:46.720
 same functionality around comments, plus adding some extra niceties to archive, like being able

24:46.720 --> 24:51.680
 to very easily extract the references of a paper that you're looking at or being able to extract

24:51.680 --> 24:56.480
 the BibDec in order to cite that paper yourself. So it's an overlay on top of archive.

24:56.480 --> 25:01.120
 Yeah, the idea is that you can have that commenting interface without having to leave archive.

25:01.120 --> 25:07.760
 It's kind of incredible. I didn't know about it. And once I've learned of it, it's like, holy shit.

25:07.760 --> 25:14.880
 Why isn't it more popular given how popular archive is? Like everybody should be using it.

25:14.880 --> 25:21.360
 Archive sucks in terms of its interface. Or let me rephrase that. It's limited in terms of its

25:21.360 --> 25:30.720
 interface. Archive is a pretty incredible project. And in a way, the growth has been completely

25:30.720 --> 25:36.080
 linear over time. If you look at like number of papers published on archive, it's pretty much

25:36.080 --> 25:41.760
 a straight line for the past 20 years. Especially if you're coming from a startup background,

25:41.760 --> 25:47.040
 and then you were trying to do archive, you'd probably try all sorts of growth acts and try to

25:47.840 --> 25:53.120
 then maybe have paid features and things like that. And that would kind of maybe ruin it.

25:53.120 --> 25:59.360
 And so there's a subtle balance there. And I don't know what aspects you can change about it.

25:59.360 --> 26:06.000
 Yeah. For some tools in science, it just takes time for them to grow. Archive is just turned 30,

26:06.000 --> 26:11.280
 I believe. And for people that don't know, archive is these kind of online repository where people

26:11.280 --> 26:16.880
 put preprints, which are versions of the papers before they actually make it to journals.

26:17.520 --> 26:24.720
 ARXIV, for people who don't know. And it's actually a really vibrant place to publish your

26:24.720 --> 26:30.960
 papers in the aforementioned communities of mathematics, physics, and computer science.

26:30.960 --> 26:36.400
 It started with mathematics and physics, and then over the last 30 years, it evolved. And now,

26:36.400 --> 26:42.240
 actually computer science now, it's a more popular category than physics and math on archive.

26:42.240 --> 26:47.680
 And there's also, which I don't know very much about, like biology, medical version of that as

26:47.680 --> 26:55.680
 bioarchive. Yeah, bioarchive. It's interesting because if you look at these platforms for

26:55.680 --> 27:02.800
 preprints, they actually play a super important role. Because if you look at a category like math,

27:03.840 --> 27:11.120
 for some papers in math, it might take close to three years after you click upload paper

27:11.120 --> 27:15.520
 on the journal website, and the paper gets published on the website of the journal.

27:15.520 --> 27:22.720
 So this is literally the longest upload period on the internet. And during those three years,

27:25.280 --> 27:31.760
 that content is just locked. And so that's why it's so important for people to have websites like

27:31.760 --> 27:36.160
 archive so that you can share that before it goes to the journal with the rest of the world.

27:36.160 --> 27:42.160
 That was actually on archive that Perlman published the three papers that led to the proof of the

27:42.160 --> 27:47.920
 Poincaré conjecture. And then you have other fields like machine learning, for instance,

27:47.920 --> 27:53.920
 where the field is evolving at such a high rate that people don't even wait before the papers

27:53.920 --> 27:58.560
 go to journals before they start working on top of those papers. So they publish them on archive,

27:58.560 --> 28:03.360
 then other people see them, they start working on that. And archive did a really good job at

28:03.360 --> 28:09.440
 like building that core platform to host papers. But I think there's a really, really big opportunity

28:09.440 --> 28:13.920
 in building more features on top of that platform apart from just hosting papers. So

28:13.920 --> 28:19.440
 collaboration, annotations, and like having other things apart from papers like code

28:20.560 --> 28:24.960
 and other things. Because for instance, in the field like machine learning,

28:24.960 --> 28:29.520
 there's a really big, you know, as I mentioned, people start working on on top of preprints,

28:29.520 --> 28:35.840
 and they are assuming that that that preprint is correct. But you really need a way, for instance,

28:35.840 --> 28:42.560
 to maybe it's not peer review, but distinguish what is good work from bad work on archive. How

28:42.560 --> 28:47.760
 do you do that? So like a commenting interface like librarian, it's useful for that so that

28:47.760 --> 28:53.440
 you can distinguish that in a field that is growing so fast as machine learning.

28:53.440 --> 28:59.520
 And then you have platforms that focus on just biology, bio archive is a good example.

28:59.520 --> 29:07.920
 Bio archive is also super interesting because there's actually an interesting experiment that

29:07.920 --> 29:16.400
 was run in the 60s. So in the 60s, the NIH supported this experiment called information

29:16.400 --> 29:24.320
 exchange group, which at the time was a way for researchers to share biology preprints via mail

29:24.320 --> 29:30.320
 or using libraries. And that project in the 1960s got canceled six years after it started.

29:30.320 --> 29:35.520
 And it was due to intense pressure from the journals to kill that project because they

29:35.520 --> 29:43.120
 were fearing competition from the preprints for the journal industry.

29:43.120 --> 29:50.960
 Creek was also one of the famous scientists that opposed to the information exchange group.

29:50.960 --> 29:55.120
 And it's interesting because right now, if you analyze the number of biology papers

29:55.120 --> 30:03.600
 that appear first as preprints, it's only 2% of the papers. And this was almost 50 years after

30:03.600 --> 30:08.800
 that first experiment. So you can see like that pressure from the journals to cancel that initial

30:08.800 --> 30:15.840
 version of a preprint repo added tremendous impact on the number of papers that are showing up in

30:15.840 --> 30:23.920
 biology as preprints. So it delayed a lot that revolution. But now platforms like bio archive

30:23.920 --> 30:28.320
 are doing that work. But there's still a lot of room for growth there. And I think it's super

30:28.320 --> 30:31.040
 important because those are the papers that are open that everyone can read.

30:31.840 --> 30:37.120
 Okay. So if we just look at the entire process of science as a big system, can we just talk about

30:37.120 --> 30:44.320
 how it can be revolutionized? So you have an idea, depending on the field,

30:44.320 --> 30:49.040
 you want to make that idea concrete, you want to run a few experiments in computer size,

30:49.040 --> 30:56.400
 there might be some code, there'd be a data set for, you know, some of the more sort of biology,

30:57.280 --> 31:04.560
 psychology, you might be collecting the data set that's called, you know, a study, right?

31:05.440 --> 31:10.320
 So that's part of that. That's part of the methodology. And so you are putting all that

31:10.320 --> 31:20.000
 into a paper form. And then you have some results. And then you submit that to a place for review

31:20.000 --> 31:24.880
 through the peer review process. And there's a process where how would you summarize the peer

31:24.880 --> 31:30.400
 review process? But it's really just like a handful of people look over your paper and comment and

31:30.400 --> 31:36.320
 based on that decide whether your paper is good or not. So there's a whole broken nature to it.

31:36.320 --> 31:41.360
 At the same time, I love the peer review process. When I buy stuff on Amazon,

31:44.960 --> 31:49.920
 for like the commenting system, whatever that is. So okay, so there's a bunch of possibilities for

31:49.920 --> 31:54.640
 revolutions there. And then there's the other side, which is the collaborative aspect of the

31:54.640 --> 32:00.640
 science, which is people annotating, people commenting, sort of the low effort collaboration,

32:00.640 --> 32:05.680
 which is a comment. Sometimes, as you've talked about, a comment can change everything.

32:05.680 --> 32:11.840
 But, you know, or a higher effort collaboration, like more like maybe annotations or even like

32:11.840 --> 32:19.360
 contributing to the paper, you can think of like collaborative updating of the paper over time.

32:20.080 --> 32:25.520
 So there's all these possibilities for doing things better than they've been done.

32:27.040 --> 32:31.040
 Can we talk about some ideas in this space? Some ideas that you're working on,

32:31.040 --> 32:36.320
 some ideas that you're not yet working on, but should be revolutionized. Because it does seem

32:37.120 --> 32:44.640
 that archive and like open review, for example, are like the craigslist of science. Like,

32:46.320 --> 32:53.600
 yeah, okay, I'm very grateful that we have it. But it just feels like it's like 10 to 20 years.

32:53.600 --> 32:58.240
 Like it doesn't feel like that's a feature. The simplicity of it is a feature. It feels like

32:58.240 --> 33:07.520
 it's a bug. But then again, the pushback there is Wikipedia has the same kind of simplicity to it.

33:08.320 --> 33:14.320
 And it seems to work exceptionally well in the crowdsourcing aspect of it. So, sorry,

33:14.320 --> 33:19.600
 there's a bunch of stuff going on the table. Let's just pick random things that we can talk about.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.920
 Wikipedia, you know, for me, it's the cosmological constant of the internet.

33:23.920 --> 33:28.400
 It's like, I think we are lucky to live in the parallel universe where Wikipedia exists.

33:28.400 --> 33:32.560
 Yes. Because if someone had pitched me Wikipedia, like a publicly edited

33:33.760 --> 33:39.120
 encyclopedia, like a couple of years ago, it would be, I don't know how many people would have said

33:39.120 --> 33:44.480
 that that would have survived. I mean, it makes almost no sense. It's like having a Google

33:44.480 --> 33:48.720
 doc that everybody on the internet can edit. And like, that will be like the most reliable

33:48.720 --> 33:54.320
 source for knowledge. And I don't know how many, but hundreds of thousands of topics.

33:54.320 --> 34:00.320
 Yeah. It's insane. It's insane. And like you have, and then you have users, like there's one,

34:00.320 --> 34:05.920
 a single user that edited one third of the articles on Wikipedia. So we have these really,

34:05.920 --> 34:13.600
 really big power users. There are a substantial part of like what makes Wikipedia successful.

34:13.600 --> 34:21.120
 And so like, no one would have ever imagined that that could happen. And so that, that's,

34:21.120 --> 34:25.920
 that's one thing I completely agree with what you just said. I also started to interrupt briefly.

34:25.920 --> 34:31.280
 Maybe let's inject that into the discussion of everything else. I also believe I've seen

34:31.280 --> 34:37.520
 that with Stack Overflow, that one individual or a small collection of individuals contribute or

34:37.520 --> 34:44.640
 revolutionize most of the community. Like if you create a really powerful system for archive or

34:44.640 --> 34:53.040
 like open review and made it really easy and compelling and exciting for one person who is in

34:53.040 --> 34:58.640
 like a 10x contributor to do their thing, that's going to change everything. It seems like that

34:58.640 --> 35:02.800
 was the mechanism that changed everything for Wikipedia. And that's the mechanism that changed

35:02.800 --> 35:08.800
 everything for Stack Overflow is gamifying or making it exciting or just making it fun or

35:08.800 --> 35:15.280
 pleasant or fulfilling in some way for those people who are insane enough to like answer

35:15.280 --> 35:21.920
 thousands of questions or write thousands of factoids and like research them and check them,

35:21.920 --> 35:27.200
 all those kinds of things, or read thousands of papers. Yeah. No, Stack Overflow is another

35:27.200 --> 35:34.800
 great example of that. And those are both two incredibly productive communities that generate

35:34.800 --> 35:43.520
 a ton of value and capture almost none of it. In a way, it's almost like counter,

35:45.440 --> 35:51.120
 it's very counterintuitive that these communities would exist and thrive.

35:51.120 --> 35:57.840
 And it's really hard to, there aren't that many communities like that.

35:57.840 --> 36:02.400
 So how do we do that for science? Do you have ideas there? Like what are the

36:02.400 --> 36:04.880
 biggest problems that you see? You're working on some of them?

36:04.880 --> 36:09.120
 Like just on that, there are a couple of really interesting experiments that people are running.

36:09.120 --> 36:15.440
 An example would be like the Polymath Projects. So this is kind of a social experiment that was

36:15.440 --> 36:22.880
 created by Tim Gowers, Fields Medalist. And his idea was to try to prove that is it possible to do

36:22.880 --> 36:29.520
 mathematics in a massively collaborative way on the internet? So he decided to pick a couple of

36:29.520 --> 36:36.880
 problems and test that. And they found out that it actually is possible for specific types of

36:36.880 --> 36:42.800
 problems, namely problems that you're able to break down in little pieces and go step by step.

36:42.800 --> 36:49.200
 You might need, as with open source, you might need people that are just kind of reorganizing

36:49.200 --> 36:55.040
 the house every once in a while. And then people throw a bunch of ideas and then you make some

36:55.040 --> 37:00.480
 progress, then you reorganize, you reframe the problem, you go step by step. But they were actually

37:00.480 --> 37:08.080
 able to prove that it is possible to collaborate online and do progress in terms of mathematics.

37:08.080 --> 37:14.400
 And so I'm confident that there are other avenues that could be explored here.

37:14.400 --> 37:19.760
 Can we talk about peer review, for example? Absolutely. I think in terms of the peer review,

37:19.760 --> 37:28.800
 I think it's important to look at the bigger picture here of what the scientific publishing

37:28.800 --> 37:34.880
 ecosystem looks like. Because for me, there are a lot of things that are wrong about that

37:34.880 --> 37:43.200
 entire process. So if you look at what publishing means in a traditional journal, you have journals

37:43.200 --> 37:52.320
 that pay authors for their articles. And then they might pay reviewers to review those articles.

37:52.320 --> 37:59.680
 And finally, they pay people or distributors to distribute the content. In the scientific

37:59.680 --> 38:04.480
 publishing world, you have scientists that are usually backed by government grants.

38:04.480 --> 38:09.280
 They are giving away their work for free in the form of papers. And then you have other

38:09.280 --> 38:15.200
 scientists that are reviewing their work. This process is known as the peer review process,

38:15.200 --> 38:23.120
 again for free. And then finally, we have government backed universities and libraries

38:23.120 --> 38:30.400
 that are buying back all that work so that other scientists can read. So this is, for me,

38:30.400 --> 38:34.640
 it's bizarre. You have the government that is funding the research, is paying the salaries

38:34.640 --> 38:38.560
 of the scientists, is paying the salaries of the reviewers, and is buying back all that

38:39.680 --> 38:45.760
 product of their work, again. And I think the problem with this system, and it's why it's so

38:45.760 --> 38:53.920
 difficult to break this suboptimal equilibrium, is because of the way academia works right now,

38:53.920 --> 39:01.680
 and the way you can progress in your academic life. And so in a lot of fields, the competition in

39:01.680 --> 39:10.080
 academia is really insane. So you have hundreds of PhD students, they are trying to get to a

39:10.080 --> 39:18.160
 professor position, and it's hyper competitive. And the only way for you to get there is if you

39:18.160 --> 39:25.760
 publish papers, ideally in journals, with a high impact factor. In computer science, it's often

39:25.760 --> 39:29.520
 conferences are also very prestigious, or actually more prestigious than journals now.

39:30.320 --> 39:34.720
 Interesting. So that's the one discipline where, I mean, that has to do with the thing we've discussed

39:35.600 --> 39:42.880
 in terms of how quickly the field turns around. But like, NeurIPS, CVPR, those conferences are

39:42.880 --> 39:48.320
 more prestigious, or at the very least, as prestigious as the journals. But yeah, but doesn't

39:48.320 --> 39:54.240
 matter. The process is what it is. And so for people that don't know, the impact factor of a

39:54.240 --> 39:58.880
 journal is basically the average number of citations that a paper would get if it gets

39:58.880 --> 40:07.600
 published on that journal. But so you can really think that the problem with the impact factor

40:07.600 --> 40:15.920
 is that it's a way to turn papers into accounting units. And let me unpack this, because it's the

40:15.920 --> 40:22.240
 impact factor is almost like a nobility title. So because papers are born with impact, even before

40:22.240 --> 40:28.240
 anyone reads them. So the researchers, they don't have the incentive to care about if this paper

40:28.240 --> 40:34.560
 is going to ever a long term impact on the world, what they care their goal, their end goal is the

40:34.560 --> 40:40.640
 paper to get published. So that they get that value upfront. So for me, that is one of the

40:40.640 --> 40:46.960
 problems of that. And that really creates a tyranny of metrics. Because at the end of the day, if

40:46.960 --> 40:53.040
 you are a dean, what you want to hire is people, researchers that publish papers on journals with

40:53.040 --> 40:58.000
 high impact factors, because that will increase the ranking of your university and will allow you

40:58.000 --> 41:06.320
 to charge more for tuition, so on and so forth. And especially when you are in super competitive

41:06.320 --> 41:14.880
 areas, that people will try to gamify that system and misconduct starts showing up. There's a really

41:14.880 --> 41:21.200
 interesting book on this topic called Gaming the Metrics. It's a book by a researcher called

41:21.200 --> 41:29.280
 Mario Biajoli. It goes a lot into the impact factor and metrics affect science negatively.

41:29.280 --> 41:33.600
 And it's interesting to think, especially in terms of citations, if you look at the early

41:33.600 --> 41:39.680
 work of looking at citations, there was a lot of work that was done by a guy called Eugene Garfield.

41:39.680 --> 41:44.800
 And this guy, the early work in terms of citation, they wanted to use citations as

41:44.800 --> 41:52.560
 a descriptive point of view. So what they wanted to create was a map. And that map would create a

41:52.560 --> 41:59.680
 visual representation of influence. So citations would be links between papers. And ideally,

41:59.680 --> 42:04.960
 what they would show, they would represent is that you read someone else's paper and it had an

42:04.960 --> 42:10.080
 impact on your research. They weren't supposed to be counted. I think this inspired Larry and

42:10.080 --> 42:15.920
 Sergei's work for Google. Exactly. I think they even mentioned that. But what happens is, as you

42:15.920 --> 42:23.760
 start counting citations, you create a market. And the same way, and the work of Eugene Garfield

42:23.760 --> 42:29.440
 was a big inspiration for Larry and Sergei and for the page rank algorithm that led to the

42:29.440 --> 42:34.960
 creation of Google. And they even recognized that. And if you think about it, it's the same way

42:34.960 --> 42:41.760
 there's a gigantic market for search engine optimization, SEO, where people try to optimize

42:42.480 --> 42:49.040
 the page rank and how a web page will rank on Google, the same will happen for papers.

42:49.040 --> 42:56.160
 People will try to optimize the impact factors and the citations that they get. And that creates

42:56.160 --> 43:01.760
 a really big problem. And it's super interesting to actually analyze the, if you look at the

43:01.760 --> 43:06.640
 distribution of the impact factors of journals, you have like nature with,

43:07.520 --> 43:12.880
 nature, I believe it's like in the low 40s. And then you have, I believe science is high 30s.

43:12.880 --> 43:20.240
 And then you have a really good set of good journals that will fall between 10 and 30.

43:20.240 --> 43:26.480
 And then you have a gigantic tell of journals that have impact factor below two. And you can

43:26.480 --> 43:34.320
 really see two economies here. You see the universities that are maybe less prestigious,

43:34.320 --> 43:40.560
 less known, that where the faculty are pressured to just publish papers, regardless of the journal,

43:40.560 --> 43:45.520
 what I want to do is increase the ranking of my university. And so they end up publishing

43:45.520 --> 43:50.960
 as many papers as they can in like journals with low impact factor. And unfortunately,

43:50.960 --> 43:58.480
 this represents a lot of the global south. And then you have the luxury good economy.

43:59.440 --> 44:03.920
 So for instance, for, and there are also problems here in the luxury good economy. So if you look

44:03.920 --> 44:10.720
 at the journal like nature, so with impact factor of like in the low 40s, there's no way

44:10.720 --> 44:15.920
 that you're going to be able to sustain that level of impact factor by just grabbing the

44:15.920 --> 44:22.880
 attention of scientists. What I mean by that is like, for the journals, the articles that

44:22.880 --> 44:30.240
 get published in nature, they need to be New York Times great. So they need to make it to the,

44:30.240 --> 44:34.160
 you know, to the, to the big media, they need to be captured by the big media. And because

44:34.160 --> 44:39.520
 that's the only way for you to capture enough attention to sustain that level of citations.

44:39.520 --> 44:45.760
 Yes. And that of course creates problems because people then will try to again gamify the system

44:45.760 --> 44:53.040
 and have like titles or abstracts or that are bigger claim, make claims that are bigger than

44:53.040 --> 44:59.440
 what is actually can be sustained by the data or the content of the paper. And you will have

44:59.440 --> 45:06.080
 clickbait titles or clickbait abstracts. And again, this is all a consequence of metrics and

45:06.880 --> 45:12.480
 science or metrics. And, and this is a very dangerous cycle that I think it's very hard to

45:12.480 --> 45:18.640
 break, but it's happening in academia in a lot of fields right now. Is it fundamentally the

45:18.640 --> 45:25.280
 existence of metrics or the metrics just need to be significantly improved? Because like I said,

45:25.280 --> 45:32.560
 the metrics used for Amazon for purchasing, I don't know, computer parts is pretty damn good

45:32.560 --> 45:39.040
 in terms of selecting which are the good ones, which are not. In that same way, if we had Amazon

45:39.040 --> 45:45.040
 type of review system in the space of ideas, in the space of science, it feels like that those

45:45.040 --> 45:53.920
 metrics would be a little bit better. Sort of when it's significantly more open to the crowdsourced

45:53.920 --> 46:01.040
 nature of the internet, of the scientific internet, meaning as opposed to like my biggest problem

46:01.040 --> 46:09.120
 with peer review has always been that it's like five, six, seven people, usually even less. And

46:09.120 --> 46:16.720
 it's often nobody's incentivized to do a good job in the whole process, meaning it's anonymous

46:17.680 --> 46:26.160
 in a way that doesn't incentivize, like doesn't gamify or incentivize great work. And also,

46:26.160 --> 46:34.880
 it doesn't necessarily have to be anonymous. Like there has to be, the entire system doesn't

46:34.880 --> 46:43.440
 encourage actual sort of rigorous review. For example, like open review does kind of incentivize

46:43.440 --> 46:49.120
 that kind of process of collaborative review, but it's also imperfect. But it just feels like

46:49.120 --> 46:54.960
 the thing that Amazon has, which is like thousands of people contributing their reviews to a product.

46:54.960 --> 47:04.640
 It feels like that could be applied to science, where the same kind of thing you're doing with

47:04.640 --> 47:11.200
 from Oz Library, but doing at a scale that's much larger. It feels like that should be possible,

47:11.920 --> 47:18.160
 given the number of grad students, given the number of general public that's, for example,

47:18.160 --> 47:27.680
 I personally, as a person who got an education in mathematics and computer science, I can

47:27.680 --> 47:38.400
 be a quote unquote reviewer on a lot bigger set of things than is my exact expertise. If I'm one

47:38.400 --> 47:44.880
 of thousands of reviewers, if I'm the only reviewer, one of five, then I better be like an expert

47:44.880 --> 47:52.640
 in the thing. And I've learned this with COVID, which is like, you can just use your basic skills

47:52.640 --> 47:58.560
 as a data analyst to contribute to the review process on a particular little aspect of a paper

47:58.560 --> 48:05.680
 and be able to comment, be able to sort of draw in some references that challenge the ideas presented

48:05.680 --> 48:14.480
 or to enrich the ideas that are presented. It just feels like crowdsourcing the review process

48:14.480 --> 48:21.440
 would be able to allow you to have metrics in terms of how good a paper is that are much

48:21.440 --> 48:26.720
 better representative of its actual impact in the world, of its actual value to the world,

48:26.720 --> 48:34.080
 as opposed to some kind of arbitrary gamified version of its impact.

48:34.880 --> 48:40.320
 I agree with that. I think there's definitely the possibility, at least for a more resilient

48:40.320 --> 48:46.000
 system than what we have today. And I think that's kind of what you're describing. To an extent,

48:46.000 --> 48:52.400
 we kind of have a little bit of a Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When you pick a metric,

48:52.400 --> 48:56.480
 as soon as you do it, then maybe it works as a good heuristic for a short amount of time,

48:56.480 --> 49:02.560
 but soon enough, people start gamifying. But then you can definitely have metrics that are more

49:02.560 --> 49:09.200
 resilient to gamification, and they'll work as a better heuristic to try to push you in the best

49:09.200 --> 49:15.120
 direction. But I guess the underlying problem you're saying is there's just shortage of positions

49:15.120 --> 49:21.360
 in academia. That's a big problem for me. Yeah. And so they're going to be constantly gamifying

49:21.360 --> 49:29.120
 the metrics. It's a very competitive field. And that's what usually happens in very competitive

49:29.680 --> 49:36.480
 fields. But I think some of the peer review problems, scale helps, I think. And it's

49:36.480 --> 49:41.040
 interesting to look at what you're mentioning, breaking it down, maybe in smaller parts and

49:41.040 --> 49:48.080
 having more people jumping in. But this is definitely a problem. And the peer review

49:48.080 --> 49:53.520
 problem, as I mentioned, is correlated with the problem of academic career progression. And it's

49:53.520 --> 50:00.320
 all intertwined. And that's why I think it's so hard to break it. There are a couple of

50:00.320 --> 50:04.000
 really interesting things that are being done right now. There are a couple of, for instance,

50:04.000 --> 50:11.040
 journals that are overlay journals on top of platforms like archive and bio archive that

50:11.040 --> 50:16.080
 want to remove like the more traditional journals from the equation. So essentially, a journal

50:16.080 --> 50:23.440
 is just a collection of links to papers. And what they're trying to do is like removing that middle

50:23.440 --> 50:30.320
 man and trying to make the review process a little bit more transparent. And not charging

50:30.320 --> 50:35.280
 universities like there's there's a couple of there are a couple of more famous ones. There's

50:35.280 --> 50:40.720
 one discrete analysis in mathematics. There's one called the quantum journal, which we're actually

50:40.720 --> 50:45.360
 working with them. We have a partnership with them for the purpose that cat published in quantum

50:45.360 --> 50:50.320
 journal, they also get the annotations on formats. And they're doing pretty well, they've been able

50:50.320 --> 50:55.200
 to grow substantially, the problem there is getting to critical mass. So it's again, convincing the

50:55.200 --> 51:01.120
 researchers and especially the young researchers that need need that impact factor need those

51:01.120 --> 51:07.520
 publications to have citations to not publish on the traditional journal and go on an open journal

51:07.520 --> 51:12.240
 and publish their work there. There I think there are a couple of really high profiled

51:12.240 --> 51:17.680
 scientists of people like team Gowers that are trying to incentivize like famous scientists

51:17.680 --> 51:22.960
 that already have tenure and that don't need that to publish that to increase the reputation

51:22.960 --> 51:28.240
 of those journals. So that other maybe younger scientists can start publishing on on those as

51:28.240 --> 51:35.040
 well. And so they can try to break that vicious cycle of of the more traditional journals.

51:35.040 --> 51:42.320
 I mean, another possible way to break this cycle is to like raise public awareness and just by force

51:42.320 --> 51:49.600
 like ban paid journals. Like what exactly are they contributing to the world? Like basically

51:49.600 --> 51:57.840
 making it illegal to forget the fact that it's mostly federally funded. So that's that's a super

51:57.840 --> 52:06.320
 ugly picture too. But like, why should knowledge be so expensive? Like where everyone is working

52:06.320 --> 52:12.560
 for the public good. And then there's these gatekeepers that you know, most people can't read

52:12.560 --> 52:20.400
 most papers without having to pay money. And that's that doesn't make any sense. That's like

52:20.400 --> 52:25.040
 that that should be illegal. I mean, that's what you're saying is exactly right. I mean, for instance,

52:25.600 --> 52:30.960
 right, I went to school here in the US, we studied in Europe. And you would sit like you'd

52:30.960 --> 52:34.720
 ask me all the time to download papers and send it to him because he just couldn't get it and like

52:34.720 --> 52:39.920
 papers that he needed for his research. And so but he's a student like he's a grad student.

52:39.920 --> 52:44.480
 He was a grad student. But that you know, I'm even referring to just regular people. Oh yeah,

52:44.480 --> 52:52.720
 okay, that too. And I think during 2020, because of COVID, a lot of journals put down the

52:53.520 --> 52:59.440
 walls for certain kind of coronavirus related papers. But like that just gave me an indication

52:59.440 --> 53:06.080
 that like, this should be done for everything. It's absurd. Like people should be outraged

53:06.080 --> 53:11.760
 that there is these gates. Because so the moment you dissolve the journals,

53:12.640 --> 53:18.960
 then there will be an opportunity for startups to build stuff on top of archive. It'll be an

53:18.960 --> 53:25.600
 opportunity for like, for my library to step up to scale up to something much even larger. I mean,

53:25.600 --> 53:31.360
 that was the original dream of Google, which I've always admired, which is make the world's

53:31.360 --> 53:36.640
 information accessible. Actually, it's interesting that Google hasn't, maybe you guys can correct me,

53:36.640 --> 53:42.640
 but they have put together Google Scholar, which is incredible. But they, and they've the scanning

53:42.640 --> 53:50.160
 of books, but they haven't really tried to make science accessible in the in the following way.

53:50.160 --> 53:57.200
 Like, besides doing Google Scholar, they haven't like, delved into the papers, right?

53:57.200 --> 54:02.160
 Which is especially curious, given what we was saying, right? That it's kind of in their genesis.

54:02.160 --> 54:06.960
 There's this, you know, research that was very connected with our papers reference each other

54:06.960 --> 54:12.320
 and like building a network out of that. Interesting enough, like Google, I think there was a,

54:12.320 --> 54:17.040
 there was not intent Google plus was like the Google social network that caught counsel was

54:17.040 --> 54:21.440
 used by a lot of researchers. Yes, it was. Whether I think was just a, you know, side,

54:21.440 --> 54:24.880
 kind of the side effect, but then a lot of people ended up migrating to Twitter,

54:24.880 --> 54:30.800
 but it was not on purpose. But yeah, I agree with you, like they haven't gone past Google Scholar.

54:30.800 --> 54:36.320
 Well, that said, Google Scholar is incredible. For people who are not familiar, it's one of the

54:36.320 --> 54:42.240
 best aggregation of all the scientific work that's out there, and especially the network

54:42.240 --> 54:47.280
 that connects all of them, what sites, what, and also trying to aggregate all of the versions of

54:47.280 --> 54:52.800
 the papers that are available there and trying to merge them in a way that one particular work,

54:52.800 --> 54:58.000
 even though it's available in a bunch of places, counts as, you know, like a central hub of what

54:58.000 --> 55:04.240
 that work is across the multiple versions. But that almost seems like a fun head project of a

55:04.240 --> 55:10.160
 couple of engineers within Google as opposed to a serious effort to make the world science

55:10.160 --> 55:16.240
 accessible. But going back to just the journals when you're talking about that Lex, I believe that

55:16.240 --> 55:24.960
 in that front, I think we might be past the event horizon. So I think the model, the business model

55:24.960 --> 55:29.760
 for the journals doesn't make sense. They are a middle layer that is not adding a lot of value.

55:29.760 --> 55:35.920
 And you see a lot of motions, whereas like in Europe, a lot of the papers that are get

55:36.720 --> 55:43.440
 are funded by the European Union, they will have to be open to the public. And I think there's a

55:43.440 --> 55:51.760
 lot of the gates to like what the Gates Foundation funds, like the demand that it's accessible to

55:51.760 --> 55:57.920
 everybody. So I think it's the question of time before that wall kind of falls. And that is going

55:57.920 --> 56:04.480
 to open a lot of possibilities. Because, you know, imagine if you had like the layer of that

56:04.480 --> 56:11.360
 gigantic layer of papers all available online, you know, that unlocks a lot of potential as a

56:11.360 --> 56:15.840
 platform for people to build things on top of that. But to what you're saying, it is weird,

56:15.840 --> 56:23.440
 like you can literally go and listen to any song that was ever made on your phone, right? You open

56:23.440 --> 56:28.000
 Spotify and you might not even pay for it. You might be on the free version and you can listen to

56:28.000 --> 56:35.280
 any song that was ever made pretty much. But there's like you don't have access to a huge

56:35.280 --> 56:41.040
 percentage of academic papers, which is just like this fundamental knowledge that we're all funding,

56:41.040 --> 56:46.080
 but you as an individual don't have access to it. And somehow, you know, like the problem for music

56:46.080 --> 56:51.920
 got solved. But for papers, it's still like... It's just not yet. It could be ad supported,

56:51.920 --> 56:56.400
 all those kinds of things. And then hopefully that would change the way we do science. That's the

56:56.400 --> 57:03.280
 most exciting thing for me is especially once I started like making videos and this silly podcast

57:03.280 --> 57:09.920
 thing, I started to realize like that if you want to do science, one of the most effective ways is

57:09.920 --> 57:17.120
 to do a like couple the paper with a set of YouTube videos, like explaining it.

57:19.280 --> 57:23.920
 That also seems like there's a lot of room for disruption there. What is the paper 2.0

57:23.920 --> 57:31.360
 going to look like? I think like LaTeX and the PDF seems like if you look at the first

57:31.360 --> 57:35.760
 paper that got published in Nature and if you look at the paper that got published in Nature

57:35.760 --> 57:41.280
 today, if you look at the two side by side, they are fundamentally the same. And even though like

57:41.280 --> 57:47.840
 the paper that gets published today, you know, you get even code like right now, people put like

57:47.840 --> 57:56.240
 code on a PDF. And there are so many things that are related to papers today. You have data,

57:56.240 --> 58:03.840
 you have code, you might need videos to better explain the concepts. So I think for me it's

58:03.840 --> 58:08.000
 natural that there's going to be also an evolution there, that papers are not going to be just the

58:08.000 --> 58:13.440
 static PDFs or LaTeX. There's going to be a next interface.

58:14.000 --> 58:19.520
 So in academia, a lot of things that are judged, your judge by is often quantity, not quality.

58:20.400 --> 58:26.480
 I wonder if there's an opportunity to have like, I tend to judge people by the best work they've

58:26.480 --> 58:31.920
 ever done as opposed to, I wonder if there's a possibility for that to encourage sort of

58:31.920 --> 58:38.240
 focusing on the quality and not necessarily in paper form, but maybe a subset of a paper,

58:38.240 --> 58:42.880
 a subset of idea, almost even a blog post or an experiment. Like why does it have to be

58:42.880 --> 58:50.400
 published in a journal to be legitimate? And it's interesting that you mentioned that I also think

58:50.400 --> 58:59.040
 like, yeah, it's why is that the only format? Why can't a blog post or we were even experimenting

58:59.040 --> 59:07.600
 with these a few months ago, can you actually like publish something or like a new scientific

59:07.600 --> 59:13.280
 breakthrough or something that you've discovered in the form of like a set of tweets,

59:14.320 --> 59:21.200
 a Twitter thread? Why can't that be possible? And we were experimenting with that idea.

59:21.840 --> 59:27.440
 We even, yeah, we ran a couple of, like some people submitted a couple of those,

59:27.440 --> 59:32.000
 like I think the limit was three or four tweets. Maybe it's a new way to look at a,

59:32.000 --> 59:36.720
 you know, a proof or something. But I think it just serves to show that there should be other

59:36.720 --> 59:43.200
 ways to publish like scientific discoveries that don't fit the paper format. Well, but so even

59:43.200 --> 59:49.680
 with the Twitter thread, it would be, it would be nice to have some mechanism of formalizing it

59:49.680 --> 59:58.560
 and making it into an NFT. Maybe. Like a concrete thing that you can reference with a link that's

59:58.560 --> 1:00:07.200
 unique. Because I mean, everything we've been saying, all of that while being true,

1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:16.480
 it's also true that the constraints and the formalism of a paper works well. It like forces you,

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:23.600
 constraints forces you to narrow down your thing and literally put it on paper. But, you know,

1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:32.800
 I agree. Make concrete. And that's why, I mean, it's not broken. It just could be better.

1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:36.000
 I agree. And that's the main idea. I think there's something about writing,

1:00:36.560 --> 1:00:43.920
 whether it's a blog post or Twitter thread or a paper, that's really nice to, to concretize

1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:51.760
 a particular little idea that they can then be referenced by other ideas, then it can be built

1:00:51.760 --> 1:01:02.240
 on top of with other ideas. So let me ask, you've read quite a few papers. You've annotated quite

1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:08.160
 a few papers. Let's talk about the process itself. How do you advise people read papers?

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:15.040
 Or maybe you want to broaden it beyond just papers, but just read concrete pieces of information to

1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:21.120
 understand the insights that lay within. I would say for papers specifically, I would bring back

1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:27.120
 kind of what Louise was talking about, is that it's important to keep in mind that papers are not

1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:33.200
 optimized for ease of understanding. And so, right, there's all sorts of restrictions and size

1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:39.680
 and format and language that they can use. And so it's important to keep that in mind. And so

1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:45.920
 that if you're struggling to read a paper, that might not mean that the underlying material is

1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:52.880
 actually that hard. And so that's definitely something that, especially for us, that we

1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:58.720
 read papers and most of the times, the papers are completely outside of our comfort zone,

1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:05.360
 I guess, and so it'd be completely new areas to us. So I always try to keep that in mind.

1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:09.920
 So there's usually a certain kind of structure, like abstract introductions, methodology,

1:02:11.600 --> 1:02:16.960
 depending on the community and so on. Is there something about the process of like

1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:22.080
 how to read it, whether you want to skim it to try to find the parts that are easy to understand

1:02:22.080 --> 1:02:29.120
 and not reading it multiple times? Is there any kind of hacks that you can comment on?

1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:35.520
 I remember like Feynman had this kind of hack when he was reading papers where he would basically,

1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:44.880
 I think I believe he would read the conclusion of the paper, and we would try to just see if he

1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:50.080
 would be able to figure out how to get to the conclusion in like a couple of minutes by himself.

1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:58.480
 And he would read a lot of papers that way. And I think Fermi also did that, almost. And Fermi

1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:03.600
 was known for doing a lot of back of the envelope calculations. So he was a master at doing that.

1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:10.640
 In terms of like, especially when reading a paper, I think a lot of times people might

1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:17.600
 feel discouraged about the first time you read it, you know, it's very hard to grasp or you don't

1:03:17.600 --> 1:03:23.680
 understand a huge fraction of the paper. And I think it's having read a lot of papers in my life.

1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:29.040
 I think I've in peace with like the fact that you might spend hours where you're just reading a

1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:35.520
 paper and jumping from paper to paper, reading citations, and like your level of understanding

1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:41.840
 sometimes of the paper is very close to 0%. And all of a sudden, you know, everything kind of

1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:48.240
 makes sense and in your mind. And then, you know, you have this quantum jump where all of a sudden

1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:56.480
 you understand the big picture of the paper. And this is an exercise that I have to when

1:03:56.480 --> 1:04:01.040
 reading papers and especially like more complex papers, like, okay, you don't understand because

1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:06.240
 you're just going through the process and just keep going. And like, it might feel super chaotic,

1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:10.480
 especially if you're jumping from reference to reference, you know, you might end up with like

1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:15.120
 20 tabs opened and you're reading a ton of other papers, but it's just trusting that process

1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:21.840
 that at the end, like you'll find light. And I think for me, that's a good framework

1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:27.520
 when reading a paper. It's hard because, you know, you might end up spending a lot of time and it

1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:35.120
 looks like you're lost. But that's the process to actually understand what they're talking about

1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:40.560
 in the paper. Yeah, I think that process, I enjoy, I've found a lot of value in the process,

1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:47.120
 especially for things outside my field, reading a lot of related work sections and kind of

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:53.120
 going down that path of getting a big context of the field because what's, especially when

1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:58.720
 they're well written, there's opinions injected into the really related work, like what work is

1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:04.080
 important, what is not. And if you read multiple related work sections that cite or don't cite

1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:10.080
 each other, like the papers, you get a sense of where the field, where the tensions of the field

1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:16.880
 are, where the field is striving. And that helps you put into context, like whether the work is

1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:22.800
 radical, whether it's overselling itself, whether it's underselling itself, all those things.

1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:31.840
 And added on top of that, I find that often the related work section is the most kind of

1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:38.720
 accessible and readable part of a paper because it's kind of, it's brief to the point, it's trying

1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:43.840
 to, like summarizing, it's almost like a Wikipedia style article. The introduction is supposed to

1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:49.280
 be a compelling story or whatever, but it's often like overselling, there's like an agenda

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:54.800
 introduction. The related work usually has the least amount of agenda, except for the few

1:05:55.360 --> 1:05:59.600
 like elements where you're trying to talk shit about previous work where you're trying to sell

1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:04.720
 that you're doing much better. But other than that, when you're just painting where the field

1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:11.120
 came from or where the field stands, that's really valuable. And also, again, just to agree

1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:17.040
 with fine on the conclusion. But I get a lot of value from the breadth first search, kind of

1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:23.440
 read the conclusion, then read the related work, and then go through the references in the related

1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:30.320
 work, read the conclusion, read the related work, and just go down the tree until you like hit dead

1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:36.080
 ends or run out of coffee. And then through that process, you go back up the tree, and now you can

1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:41.040
 see the results in their proper, in their proper context. Unless, of course, the paper is truly

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:48.000
 revolutionary, which even that process will help you understand that is, in fact, truly revolutionary.

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:55.920
 Right. You've also, you talked about just following your Twitter thread in a depth first search.

1:06:55.920 --> 1:07:03.360
 You talked about that you read the book on Grisha Perlman, Grigore Perlman, and then you had a

1:07:03.360 --> 1:07:09.840
 really nice Twitter thread on it, and you were taking notes throughout. So, at a high level,

1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:15.520
 is there suggestions you can give on how to take good notes, whether we're talking about annotations

1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:22.720
 or just for yourself to try to put on paper ideas as you progress through the work in order to then

1:07:22.720 --> 1:07:29.360
 like understand the work better? For me, I always try not to underestimate how much you can forget

1:07:29.920 --> 1:07:33.600
 within six months after you've read something. Oh, I thought you were going to say five minutes,

1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:39.040
 but yeah, six months is good. Yeah, or even shorter. And so, that's something that I always try to

1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:46.640
 keep in mind, and it's often, I mean, every once in a while, I'll read back a paper that I annotated

1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:54.640
 on Fermat, and I'll read through my own annotations, and I have completely forgotten what I had written.

1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:02.880
 It also, it's interesting because in a way, after you just understood something, you're kind of the

1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:11.920
 best possible teacher that can teach your future self after you've forgotten it, you're kind of

1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:18.720
 your own best possible teacher at that moment. And so, it can be great to try to capture that.

1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:27.280
 It's brilliant. It just made me kind of realize it's really nice to put yourself in the position

1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:32.320
 of teaching an older version of yourself that returns to this paper, almost like thinking of

1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:38.320
 literally, that's underexplored. But it's super powerful because you were the person that you

1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:43.840
 can, like, if you look at the scale from like one, not knowing anything about the topic in 10,

1:08:43.840 --> 1:08:48.320
 like you are the one that progressed from one to 10, and you know which steps you struggled with.

1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:53.120
 So, you're really the best person to help yourself make that transition from one to 10.

1:08:53.680 --> 1:09:00.320
 And a lot of the times, like, and I really believe that the framework that we have to,

1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:05.920
 like, expose ourselves to, like, be talking to us when we were an expert, when we were taking

1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:10.480
 that class, and we knew everything about quantum mechanics. And then six months later, you don't

1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:16.880
 remember half of the things. How could we make it easier for, like, to have those conversations

1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:24.640
 between you and your past self, past expert self? I think there might be, it's an underexplored

1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:29.360
 idea. I think notes on paper are probably not the best way. I'm not sure if it's a combination of,

1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:35.920
 like, video, audio, where it's like you have a guided framework that you follow to extract

1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:42.240
 information from yourself so that you can later kind of revisit to make it easier to remember.

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:50.000
 But that's, I think, it's an interesting idea worth exploring. I haven't seen a lot of people kind

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:56.800
 of trying to distill that problem. Yeah, I'm creating the kind of tools. I find if I record,

1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:05.520
 it sounds weird, but I'll take notes, but if I record audio, like little clips of thoughts,

1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:13.680
 like rants, that's really effective at capturing something that notes can't. Because when I replay

1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:20.160
 them, for some reason, it loads my brain back into where I was when I was reading that in a way

1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:28.480
 that notes don't. When I read notes, I'll often be like, what? What was I thinking there? But

1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:34.800
 when I listen to the audio, it brings you right back to that place. And maybe with video, with

1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:41.440
 visual, that might be even more powerful. I think so. Yeah. And I think just the process of verbalizing

1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:48.560
 it, that alone kind of makes you have to structure your thought and put it in a way that somebody

1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:54.720
 else could come and understand it. And just the process of that is useful to organize your thoughts.

1:10:56.800 --> 1:11:02.480
 Yeah, just that alone. Does the Fermat Library Journal Club have a video component or no?

1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:09.600
 Not natively. Sometimes we'll include videos, but it's always embedded. Do people build videos

1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:14.320
 on top of it to explain the paper? Because you're doing all the hard work of understanding deeply

1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:21.680
 the paper. Not, we haven't seen that happening too much. But we were actually playing around with

1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:28.240
 the idea of creating some sort of podcast version where we try to distill the paper on an audio

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:32.720
 format that not maybe you could have access to. It might be tricky. Might be trickier, but there

1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:36.800
 are definitely people that could be interested in the paper and their topic, but are not willing to

1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:42.240
 read it. But they might listen to a 30 minute episode on that paper. Yes. You could reach more

1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:46.800
 people and you might even bring the authors to the conversation. But it's tricky and especially

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:54.000
 for more technical papers. We've thought about doing that, but we haven't converged. I'm sure if

1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:59.840
 you have any tips. Well, I'm going to take that as a small project to take one a year. One of the

1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:04.480
 Fermat is almost like half advertisement and half as a challenge for myself to take one of the

1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:13.840
 annotated papers and use it as a basis for creating a quick video. I've seen, hopefully I'm saying

1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:20.720
 the name correctly, but machine learning street talk. I think that's the name of the show that I

1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:26.800
 recommend highly. That's the right name. But they do exactly that, which is multiple hour breakdown

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:33.520
 of a paper with video component. Sometimes with authors, people love it. It's very effective.

1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:40.000
 There's also, I haven't seen the entire, in its entirety, but I've seen the founder of

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:48.960
 comma.ai George. I've seen him just taking a paper and then distilling the paper and coding it,

1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:55.760
 coding it sometimes during 10 hours. He was able to get a lot of people interested in that and

1:12:55.760 --> 1:13:03.120
 viewing him. I'm a huge fan of that. George is a personality. I think a lot of people,

1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:08.560
 like, listen to this podcast for the same reason. It's not necessarily the contents. They like to

1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:16.560
 listen to a silly Russian who has a childlike brain and mumbles and all those, like, struggle with

1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:22.880
 ideas. George is a madman. People just enjoy, like, how is he going to struggle in implementing

1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:27.120
 this particular paper? How is he going to struggle with this idea? It's fun to watch and that actually

1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:32.480
 pulls you in. The personality is important there. True, but I agree with you, but

1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:39.200
 they're also, it's visible. There's an extraordinary ability that is there. It's

1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:44.960
 talented and you need to have, there's a craft. This guy definitely has talent and he's doing

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:50.480
 something that is not easy. I think that also draws the attention of people. Oh yeah. The other

1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:55.840
 day we were actually, we ran into this YouTube channel of this guy that was restoring art.

1:13:55.840 --> 1:14:05.040
 Right. It was basically just a video of him. The production is really well done.

1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:11.760
 It's just him taking really old pieces of art and then paintings and then restoring them,

1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:18.080
 but he's really good at that and he describes that process. That draws the attention of people,

1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:22.800
 regardless of your craft. Be it, like, annotating a paper or restoring it.

1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:27.200
 Craftsmanship, excellence, yeah. George is incredibly good at programming.

1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:33.840
 You know those competitive programmers like Top Boat and all those kinds of stuff? He has the

1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:40.080
 same kind of element where the brain just jumps around really quickly and that's, yeah, just like

1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:47.120
 with art and motivation. It's motivating, but in your right, in watching people who are good

1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:51.600
 at what they do, it's motivating even if the thing you're trying to do is not what they're doing.

1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:56.880
 It's just contagious when they're really good at it. And the same kind of analysis with the paper,

1:14:56.880 --> 1:15:02.800
 I think, not just like the final result, but the process of struggling with it. That's really

1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:10.000
 interesting. Yeah. I think Twitch proved that there's really a market for that, for watching

1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:15.600
 people do things that they're really good at and you'll just watch it. You will enjoy that,

1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:23.040
 that might even spike your interest in that specific topic and yeah, and people will enjoy

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:29.760
 watching sometimes hours on end of great craftsmen. Do you mind if we talk about some of the papers?

1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:36.160
 Do any papers come to mind that have been annotated on Formaz Library? The papers that we annotated

1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:40.960
 can be about completely random topics, but that's part of what we enjoy as well. It forces you to

1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:47.280
 explore these topics that otherwise maybe you'd never run into. And so the ones that come to mind

1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:57.760
 to me are fairly random, but one that I really enjoyed learning more about is a paper written

1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:07.520
 by a mathematician actually, Tom Apostol, and about a tunnel in a Greek island off the coast

1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:15.360
 of Turkey. It's very random. Okay, so what's interesting about this tunnel? So this tunnel

1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:26.000
 was built in the 6th century BC and it was built in the island of Samos, which is, as I said,

1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:31.920
 off the coast of Turkey. They had the city on one side, then the other mountain, and then they had

1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:37.120
 a bunch of springs on the other side, and they wanted to bring water into the city.

1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:42.800
 Building an aqueduct would be pretty hard because of the way the mountain was shaped,

1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:50.160
 and it would also, if they were under a siege, they could just easily destroy that aqueduct,

1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:56.480
 and then the city wouldn't have any water supply. And so they decided to build a tunnel,

1:16:56.480 --> 1:17:07.280
 and they decided to try to do it quickly. And so they started digging from both ends at the same

1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:14.400
 time through the mountain. And so when you start thinking about this, it's a fairly difficult

1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:22.640
 problem, and this is like 6th century BC, so you had very limited access to the mathematical tools

1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:27.680
 that you had at the time were very limited. And so what this paper is about is about the story

1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:35.440
 of how they built it, and about the fact that for about 2000 years, kind of the accepted explanation

1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:40.240
 of how they built it was actually wrong. And so this tunnel has been famous for a while. There

1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:46.240
 are a number of historians that talked about it since ancient Egypt, and the method that they

1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:56.160
 described for building it was just wrong. And so these researchers went there and were able to

1:17:56.800 --> 1:18:02.240
 figure that out. And so basically, kind of the way that they thought they had built it was,

1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:07.200
 basically, if you can imagine looking at the mountain from the top, and you have the mountain,

1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:14.160
 then you have both entrances. And so what they thought, and this is what the ancient historians

1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:23.600
 described is that they effectively tried to draw a right angle triangle with the two entrances

1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:29.040
 at each end of the hypotenuse. And the way they did it is like they would go around the mountain

1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:36.080
 and kind of walking in a grid fashion, and then you can figure out the two sides of the triangle.

1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:42.880
 And then after you have that triangle, you can effectively draw two smaller triangles at each

1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:49.120
 entrance that are proportional to that big triangle. And then you kind of have arrows pointing in each

1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:56.400
 way. And then you know at least that you have a line going through the mountain that connects

1:18:56.400 --> 1:19:03.680
 both entrances. The issue with that is once you go to this mountain and you start thinking of

1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:08.240
 doing this, you realize that especially given that the tools that they had at the time,

1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:16.480
 that your error margin would be too small, you wouldn't be able to do it. Just the fact of

1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:21.200
 trying to build this triangle in that fashion, the error would accumulate and you would end

1:19:21.200 --> 1:19:24.320
 up missing. You'd start building these tunnels and they would miss each other.

1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:29.920
 So the task ultimately is to figure out really perfectly as close as possible the direction

1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:33.840
 you should be digging. First of all, that it's possible they have a straight line through

1:19:33.840 --> 1:19:40.240
 and then what that direction would be. And then you are trying to infer that by constructing a

1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:49.360
 right triangle. I'm not exactly sure about how to do that rigorously by tracing the mountain,

1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:55.040
 by walking along the mountain. You said grids. Yeah, you kind of walk as if you were in a grid.

1:19:55.040 --> 1:20:00.560
 And so you just walk in right angles. But then you have to walk really precisely then.

1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:06.880
 You have to use tools to measure this. And then the terrain is probably a mess. So this

1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:11.760
 makes more sense than 2D and 3D gets even weirder. So okay, gotcha.

1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:17.440
 But so this method was described by like an ancient Egyptian historian, I think, hero of

1:20:17.440 --> 1:20:24.160
 Alexandria. And then for about, yeah, for about 2000 years, that's how we thought that they had

1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:32.400
 built this tunnel. And then these researchers went there and found out that actually they

1:20:32.400 --> 1:20:38.880
 must have had to use other methods. And then in this paper, they describe these other methods.

1:20:38.880 --> 1:20:45.520
 And of course, they can't know for sure, but they present a bunch of plausible alternatives.

1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:50.320
 The one that for me is the most plausible is that what they probably must have done is to

1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:56.560
 use something that is similar to an iron sight on a rifle, the way you can line up

1:20:57.280 --> 1:21:01.920
 your rifle with a target off in the distance by having an iron sight.

1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:11.360
 And they must have done something similar to that, effectively with three sticks.

1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:18.640
 And that way they were able to line up sticks along the side of the mountain that were all

1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:23.920
 on the same height. And so that then you could get to the other side. And you could and then you

1:21:23.920 --> 1:21:29.920
 could draw that line. So this for me is the most plausible way that they might have done that.

1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:35.920
 And they but then they they they describe this in detail and other possible approaches in this

1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:41.040
 paper. So this is a mathematician doing this? Yeah, this is a mathematician that did this.

1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:47.680
 Which I suppose is the right mindset instead of skills required to solve an ancient problem,

1:21:47.680 --> 1:21:54.960
 right? Yeah. Mathematicians and engineers, a lot of things. Because they didn't have computers or

1:21:54.960 --> 1:21:59.920
 drones or LiDAR back then or whatever technology you would use modern day for civil engineering.

1:21:59.920 --> 1:22:06.160
 Yeah. And another fascinating thing is that like, you know, after effectively after the

1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:11.600
 downfall of the Roman civilization, people didn't build tunnels for about a thousand years. We go

1:22:11.600 --> 1:22:16.880
 a thousand years without tunnels. And then like only in late middle ages that we start doing them

1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:22.400
 again. But but here is the tunnel like 6th century BC, like incredibly limited mathematics.

1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:29.760
 And they and they build it in this way. And for and it was a mystery for a long time exactly how

1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:36.000
 they did it. And then these mathematicians went there. And basically with no archaeology kind

1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:40.720
 of background, we're able to figure it out. How do annotations for this paper look like?

1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:44.800
 What is it? What's a successful annotation for paper like this?

1:22:44.800 --> 1:22:52.560
 Yes. So sometimes you're for this paper, sometimes adding some more context on a specific

1:22:54.320 --> 1:23:01.040
 part like sometimes they mentioned, for instance, these instruments that were common in ancient Greece

1:23:01.040 --> 1:23:08.240
 and ancient Rome for for building things. And and so in some of those annotations,

1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:12.960
 I described these instruments in more detail and how they worked. Because sometimes it can be

1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:21.680
 hard to visualize these. Then this paper, I forget exactly when this was published,

1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:29.120
 I believe maybe maybe the 70s. But then there was further research into this tunnel and more

1:23:29.120 --> 1:23:35.040
 interesting other interesting aspects about it. I add those to that paper as well. There's historical

1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:42.320
 context that I also go into there. For instance, the fact that as I said that effectively after

1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:47.840
 the downfall of the Roman Empire, no tunnels were built. That's something that I added to the paper

1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:53.840
 as well. So when other people look at the paper, how do they usually consume the annotations?

1:23:55.200 --> 1:24:02.240
 Is there a commenting feature? This is a really enriching experience the way you read a paper.

1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:07.840
 What aspects do people usually talk about that they value from this?

1:24:07.840 --> 1:24:14.160
 So yeah, so anybody can just go on there and and either add a new annotation or

1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:20.400
 other comments to an existing annotation. And so you can start kind of a thread within an

1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:25.680
 existing annotation. And that's something that happens relative frequency. And then

1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:31.120
 because I was the original author of the initial annotation, I get pinged. And so oftentimes I'll

1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:38.320
 go back and add on to that thread. How'd you pick the paper? I mean, first of all, this whole process

1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:43.440
 is really exciting. I'm gonna, especially after this conversation, I'm gonna make sure I participate

1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:49.120
 much more actively on papers that I know a lot about. And on paper, I know nothing about. I should

1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:58.320
 get the annotated paper. I would love to. I also, I mean, I realized that there's like it's an

1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:06.880
 opportunity for people like me to publicly annotate a paper, like, or do an AMA around the

1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:14.160
 paper. Yeah, exactly. But yeah, but like be, be in the conversation about a paper. It's like a

1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:19.280
 place to have a conversation about an idea. You get the other way to do it that's much more at

1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:24.000
 hawk is on Twitter, right? But this is more like formal. And you could actually probably integrate

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:29.360
 the two have a conversation about the conversation. So the Twitter is the conversation about a

1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:34.400
 conversation and the main conversation is in the space of annotations. There's an interesting

1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:39.440
 effect that we see sometimes with the annotations on our papers is that a lot of people, especially if

1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:46.960
 we the annotations are really well done, people sometimes are afraid of adding more annotations

1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:52.000
 because they see that as a kind of a finished work. Yes. And so they don't want to pollute that or

1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:57.760
 and especially if it's like a silly question, this is, I don't think that's good. I think, you know,

1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:03.120
 we should as much as possible try to lower the barrier for someone to jump in and ask questions.

1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:08.640
 I think it only like most of the times it adds value, but it's some feedback that we got from

1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:18.000
 users and readers. Not exactly sure how to, to kind of fight that. But well, I think I,

1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:26.160
 I think if I serve as an inspiration in any way is by asking a lot of dumb questions and saying a

1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:31.040
 bunch of dumb shit all the time. And hopefully that inspires the rest of the other folks to

1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:36.560
 do the same because that's the only way to knowledge, I think, is to be willing to ask the

1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:41.360
 dumb questions. And there are papers that are like, you know, we have a lot of papers on Formaz

1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:47.920
 where it's just one page or really short papers. And we have like the shortest paper ever published

1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:53.200
 in a math journal. Like we'd like just a couple of words. One of my favorite papers on the platform

1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:59.280
 is actually a paper written by Enrico Fermi. And the title of the paper is My Observation,

1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:05.440
 I think is My Observations at Trinity. So basically Fermi was part of the Manhattan Project. So

1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:12.960
 he was in New Mexico when they exploded the first atomic bomb. And so he was a couple of miles away

1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:17.920
 from the explosion. And he was probably one of the first persons to calculate the energy of the

1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:24.400
 explosion. And so the way he did that was he took a piece of paper and he tore down a piece of

1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:30.240
 paper in little pieces. And when the bomb exploded, the Trinity bomb was the name of the bomb,

1:27:30.240 --> 1:27:36.880
 like he waited for the blast to arrive at where he was. And then he threw those pieces of paper in

1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:42.800
 the air. And he calculated the energy based on the displacement of the paper, the pieces of paper.

1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:47.920
 And then he wrote a report which was classified until like a couple of years ago, one page report,

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:54.160
 like calculating the energy of the explosion. So badass. And we actually went there and kind of

1:27:54.160 --> 1:28:00.160
 unpacked and I think he just mentions basically the energy and we actually went and one of the

1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:06.000
 annotations is like explaining how he did that. I wonder how accurate he was. It was maybe I

1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:12.560
 think like 20 or 25% off. Then there was another person that actually calculated the energy based

1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:20.240
 on images after the explosion at the rate and the rate at which the like the mushroom of the

1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:25.360
 explosion expanded. And it's more accurate to calculate the energy based on that. And I think

1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:31.040
 it was like 20% off. But it's really interesting because you know, Fermi was known for all these

1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:36.320
 being a master at these back of the envelope calculations. Like the Fermi problems are well

1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:42.720
 known for that. And it's super interesting to see like that just one page report that was also

1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:48.240
 actually classified. And it's interesting because a couple of months ago, when the Beirut explosion

1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:54.080
 happened, there was a video circulating of these a bride that was doing a photo shoot

1:28:54.080 --> 1:28:58.800
 when the explosion in Beirut happened. And so you can see a video of her with the wedding dress

1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:02.640
 and then the explosion happens and the blast arrives at where she was. She was a couple of

1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:09.440
 miles away from the blast. And you can see like the displacement of the dress as well. And I

1:29:09.440 --> 1:29:13.520
 actually looked and that video went viral on Twitter. And I actually looked at that video and

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:18.800
 based I use the same techniques that Fermi used to calculate the energy of the explosion

1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:24.000
 based on the displacement of the dress. And you could actually see where she was at the

1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:28.080
 the distance from the explosion because there was a store behind her and you could look the name of

1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:33.680
 the store. And so I calculated that it was the distance and then you can based on the distance

1:29:33.680 --> 1:29:38.960
 where she was from the explosion and also on the displacement of the dress. Like because you can

1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:44.400
 when the blast happens, like you can see the dress going back and then going back to the

1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:49.520
 original position and like by just looking at like how much the dress moved, you can

1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:53.760
 estimate the explosion, the energy of the explosion. I assume you published this

1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:59.840
 on Twitter. It was just a Twitter thread. But it actually like a lot of people share that and

1:29:59.840 --> 1:30:05.920
 it was picked up by a couple of news outlets. But I was hoping it would be like a formal title

1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:10.080
 and it would be an archive. No, no, no, it may be submitted just to Twitter, Twitter thread.

1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:14.480
 But it was interesting because it was exactly the same math that Fermi used.

1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:20.560
 Is there something else that jumps to mind? Like what is there something I know like in terms of

1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:25.280
 papers, like I know the Bitcoin paper is super popular. Is there something interesting to be

1:30:25.280 --> 1:30:28.480
 said about any of the white papers in the cryptocurrency space?

1:30:29.600 --> 1:30:38.080
 Yeah, the Bitcoin paper was the first paper that we put on Fermat's. Why that choice as the first

1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:45.840
 paper? This was a while ago. And it was one of the papers that I read and then kind of explained

1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:52.400
 it to Luiz and there are two other friends that do this journal club with us. And I did some research

1:30:52.400 --> 1:30:59.040
 in cryptography as an undergrad. And so it was a topic that I was interested in. But even for me,

1:30:59.040 --> 1:31:06.640
 that I had that background, but reading the Bitcoin paper, it took me a few reads to really kind of

1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:13.760
 wrap my head around it. It uses very Spartan, precise language in a way. You feel like you

1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:19.760
 can't take any word out of it without something falling apart. And it's all there. I think it's

1:31:19.760 --> 1:31:29.120
 a beautiful paper and it's very well written, of course. But we wanted to try to make it accessible

1:31:29.120 --> 1:31:35.840
 so that anybody that maybe is an undergrad and computer science could go on there and know that

1:31:35.840 --> 1:31:41.360
 you have all the information in that page that you're going to need to understand the mechanics

1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:49.760
 of Bitcoin. And so I explain the basic public key cryptography that you need to know in order to

1:31:49.760 --> 1:31:54.720
 understand it. You can explain, okay, what are the properties of a hash function and how they

1:31:54.720 --> 1:32:01.200
 are useful in this context? Explain what a Merkle tree is. So a bunch of those basic concepts that

1:32:01.200 --> 1:32:05.040
 maybe if you're reading it for a first time and you're an undergrad and you don't know those

1:32:05.040 --> 1:32:09.440
 terms, you're going to be discouraged because maybe, okay, now I have to go and Google around

1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:15.600
 until I understand these before I can make progress in the paper. And this way, it's all there.

1:32:15.600 --> 1:32:23.120
 So there's a magic to also to the fact that over time, more people went on there and added

1:32:23.120 --> 1:32:28.720
 further annotations. So the idea that the paper gets easier and more accessible over time, but

1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:35.280
 that's still you're still looking at the original content, the way the author intended it to be.

1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:41.440
 But there's just more context and the toughest bits have more in depth explanations.

1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:50.160
 Okay, I think like there's just so many interesting papers there. I remember reading the paper that

1:32:50.160 --> 1:32:56.800
 was written by Freeman Dyson on the like the first time that he explained or he came up with a concept

1:32:56.800 --> 1:33:04.400
 of the Dyson sphere. And he put that out like it's again, it's one page paper. And what he explained

1:33:04.400 --> 1:33:11.360
 was that eventually, if civilization develops and grows, there's going to be a point where

1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:18.560
 when the resources on the planet are not enough for the energy requirements of that civilization.

1:33:18.560 --> 1:33:24.000
 So if you want to go, the next step is you need to go to the next star and extract energy from

1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:30.000
 that star. And the way to do it is you need to build some sort of cap around the star that

1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:37.040
 extracts the energy. So he theorized this idea of the Dyson sphere. And he went on to kind of

1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:42.000
 analyze how he would build that, the stability of that sphere, like if something happens, like

1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:48.000
 if there's like a small oscillation with that fear collapsing to the star or no, what would happen.

1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:54.960
 And he even went on to kind of say that a good way for us to look for signs of intelligent life out

1:33:54.960 --> 1:34:01.520
 there is to look for signals of these Dyson spheres. And because, you know, according to the law of

1:34:01.520 --> 1:34:05.520
 second law of thermodynamics, like there's going to be some a lot of infrared radiation,

1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:10.480
 there is going to be emitted as a consequence of extracting energy from the star. And we should

1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:16.400
 be able to see those signals of like infrared if we look at the sky. But all these like from

1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:21.200
 the introduction of the concept, like how to build a Dyson sphere, the problems of like having a

1:34:21.200 --> 1:34:25.600
 Dyson sphere, how to detect how that could be used as a signal for intelligence life.

1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:26.960
 Wait, really? That's all in the paper?

1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:30.720
 All in one, like one page paper. And it's like, it's, for me, it's beautiful.

1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:31.040
 It's like...

1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:32.080
 What was this published?

1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:33.280
 Don't remember.

1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:40.240
 It's fascinating that papers like that could be, I mean, the guts it takes to put that all

1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:46.160
 together in a paper form. You know, that kind of challenges our previous discussion of paper.

1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:49.440
 I mean, papers can be beautiful. You can play with the format, right?

1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:56.400
 But there's a lot to unpack there. That's like the starting point. But it's beautiful that

1:34:56.400 --> 1:35:01.520
 you're able to put that in one page. And then people can build on top of that.

1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:02.960
 But the key ideas are there.

1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:03.680
 Yeah, exactly.

1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:09.680
 What about, have you looked at any of the big seminal papers throughout the history of science?

1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:12.160
 Like you look at simple like Einstein papers.

1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:15.760
 Have any of those been annotated?

1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:21.120
 Yeah, we have some more seminal papers that people have heard about.

1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:30.080
 We have the DNA double elix paper on there. We have the Higgs boson paper.

1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:38.720
 Yeah, there's papers that we know that they're not going to be finding out about them because

1:35:38.720 --> 1:35:44.880
 of us. But it's papers that we think should be more widely read and that folks would benefit

1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:48.960
 from having some annotations there. And so we also have a number of those.

1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:55.120
 A lot of discovery papers for fundamental party calls and all that. We have a lot of those on

1:35:55.120 --> 1:36:02.160
 from us library. We haven't annotated that one, but I'd like to on the Riemann hypotheses.

1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:07.280
 That's a really interesting paper as well. But we haven't annotated that one.

1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:12.880
 But there's a lot of like more historical landmark papers on the platform.

1:36:12.880 --> 1:36:17.120
 Have you done Poincaré conjecture with Perlman?

1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:25.040
 That's too much for me. But it's interesting that in going back to our discussion,

1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:29.840
 like the Poincaré paper was like published on archive and it was not on a journal,

1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:30.800
 like the three papers.

1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:34.880
 Yeah, what do you make of that? I mean, he's such a fascinating human being.

1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:38.800
 I mentioned to you offline that I'm going to Russia. He's somebody I'm really...

1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:44.400
 She tried to interview. Yeah. Well, so I definitely will interview him.

1:36:45.920 --> 1:36:51.760
 And I believe I will. I believe I can. I just don't know how to... I know where you live.

1:36:52.880 --> 1:37:00.000
 Okay. My hope is, my conjecture is that if I just show up to the house and look desperate enough

1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:06.880
 that or threatening enough for some combination of both, that like the only way to get rid of me

1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:09.040
 is to just get the thing done. That's the hope.

1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:11.920
 It's sexually interesting that you mentioned that because after...

1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:18.480
 So a couple of weeks ago, I was searching for stuff about Perlman online and I ended up on

1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:23.680
 this Twitter account of this guy that claims to be Perlman's assistant.

1:37:24.320 --> 1:37:28.320
 And he has been posting a bunch of pictures next to Perlman.

1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:34.400
 You can see Perlman in a library and he's next to him taking a selfie or Perlman walking

1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:40.080
 on the street and like, maybe you could reach out to his assistant and I'll send you...

1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:43.680
 I'll send you this Twitter account. Maybe you're onto something.

1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:49.840
 No, but going back to Perlman is super interesting because the fact that he published the proofs

1:37:49.840 --> 1:37:55.920
 on archive was also like a way for him to... Because he really didn't like the scientific

1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:02.080
 publishing industry and the fact that you had to pay to get access to articles.

1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:07.200
 And that was a form of protest and that's why he published those papers there.

1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:13.280
 I mean, I think Perlman is just a fascinating character and for me, it's this kind of ideal of...

1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:19.040
 Platonic ideal of what a mathematician should be. It's someone that is...

1:38:19.040 --> 1:38:22.320
 It just cares about... Deeply cares about mathematics.

1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:27.280
 It cares about fair attribution of disregard's money.

1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:33.600
 And the fact that he published on archive is a good example of that.

1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:39.360
 What about the Fields Medal that he turned down the Fields Medal? What do you make of that?

1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:45.920
 If you look at the reasons why he rejected the Fields Medal, so Perlman did a post talk in the

1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:51.680
 US and when he came back to Russia... Do you know how good his English is?

1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:53.040
 I think it's fairly good.

1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:53.840
 I think it's pretty good, right?

1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:54.880
 I think it's really good.

1:38:54.880 --> 1:38:57.520
 Especially in these given lectures in the American Union.

1:38:57.520 --> 1:38:58.880
 But I haven't been able to...

1:38:58.880 --> 1:38:59.760
 Listen to anything.

1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:02.800
 Well, certainly not listen, but I haven't been able to get anybody,

1:39:02.800 --> 1:39:04.960
 because I know a lot of people have been to those lectures.

1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:10.320
 I'm not able to get a sense of like, yeah, but how strong is the accent?

1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:12.720
 What are we talking about here? Is this going to have to be in Russian?

1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:14.640
 Is it going to have to be in English? It's fascinating.

1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:16.320
 But he writes the papers in English, so...

1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:20.560
 True. But there's so many... It's such a fascinating character and

1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:26.400
 there are a couple of examples like him, like at I think 28 or 29, he proved like a really

1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:29.040
 famous conjecture called the Soul Conjecture.

1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:32.160
 I believe it was like in a very short four page proof of that.

1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:33.600
 It was a really big breakthrough.

1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:36.560
 Then he went to Princeton to give a lecture on that.

1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:42.480
 And after the lecture, the chair of the math department at Princeton, a guy called Peter

1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:46.000
 Sarnak, went up to Perlman was trying to recruit him.

1:39:46.640 --> 1:39:49.440
 Trying to offer him a position at Princeton.

1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:53.120
 And at some point, he asked for Perlman's resume.

1:39:53.840 --> 1:39:59.280
 And Perlman responded saying, just give a lecture on like this really tough problem.

1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:02.400
 Why do you need my resume? I'm not going to send you.

1:40:02.400 --> 1:40:04.480
 Like I just proved my value.

1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:10.720
 But going back to the Fields Medal, like when Perlman went back to Russia,

1:40:11.760 --> 1:40:18.800
 he arrived at a time where the salary of postdocs was so much off in regards to

1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:21.760
 inflation that they were not making any money.

1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:26.480
 Like people didn't even bother to pick up the checks at the end of the month

1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:28.560
 because it was like ridiculous.

1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:33.120
 But thankfully he had some money that he had gained while he was doing his postdocs.

1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:38.000
 So he just concentrated on like the Pankara conjecture problem.

1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:44.000
 Which he, when he took that, it took it after it was reframed by this

1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:48.960
 mathematician called Richard Hamilton, which posed the problem in a way that it turned into

1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:54.320
 this super math Olympiad problem with perfect boundaries well defined.

1:40:54.320 --> 1:40:56.880
 And that was perfect for Perlman to attack.

1:40:56.880 --> 1:40:59.280
 And so he spent like seven years working on that.

1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:03.440
 And then in 2002, he started publishing those papers on archive.

1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:07.840
 And people started jumping on that, reading those papers.

1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:10.880
 And there was like a lot of excitement around that.

1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:14.320
 A couple of years later, there were two researchers, I believe it was,

1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:18.720
 they were from Harvard that took Perlman's work.

1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:20.960
 They sanded some of the edges.

1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:26.080
 And they republished that saying that based on Perlman's work,

1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:29.200
 they were able to figure out the Pankara conjecture.

1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:38.480
 And then there was at the time at the International Conference of Mathematics in 2006,

1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:41.600
 I believe that's when they were going to give out the Fields Medal.

1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:49.280
 There was a lot of debate of who should get the credit for solving this big problem.

1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:55.520
 And for Perlman, it felt really sad that people were even considering that

1:41:55.520 --> 1:41:57.280
 he was not the person that solved that.

1:41:58.160 --> 1:42:03.200
 And the claims that those researchers, when they published after Perlman,

1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:06.560
 they were false claims that they were the ones, they just sanded a couple of edges.

1:42:06.560 --> 1:42:08.480
 Like Perlman did all the really hard work.

1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:16.000
 And so just the fact that they doubted that Perlman had done that was enough for him to say,

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.320
 I'm not interested in this prize.

1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:21.440
 And that was one of the reasons why he rejected the Fields Medal.

1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:24.400
 Then he also rejected the Clay Prize.

1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:28.080
 So the Pankara conjecture was one of the Millennium Prizes.

1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:31.280
 There was a million dollar prize associated with that problem.

1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:35.440
 And that has to do with the fact that for them to attribute that prize,

1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:38.880
 I think it had to be published on a journal, the proof.

1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:43.840
 And again, Perlman's principles have interfered here.

1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:45.920
 And he also just didn't care about the money.

1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:48.800
 He was like, Clay, I think was a businessman.

1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:51.680
 And he's like, doesn't have to do anything with mathematics.

1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:52.720
 I don't care about this.

1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:56.320
 That's one of the reasons why he rejected the Prize.

1:42:56.320 --> 1:43:00.800
 Yeah, it's hard to convert into words, but at MIT,

1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:07.120
 I'm distinctly aware of the distinction between when I enter a room,

1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:12.160
 there's a certain kind of music to the way people talk when we're talking about ideas

1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:20.080
 versus what that music sounds like when we're talking, when it's like bickering

1:43:21.200 --> 1:43:27.520
 in the space of like, whether it's politics or funding or egos.

1:43:27.520 --> 1:43:29.760
 It's a different sound to it.

1:43:29.760 --> 1:43:32.880
 And I'm distinctly aware of the two.

1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:39.440
 And I kind of sort of, to me personally, happiness was just like swimming around

1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:46.480
 the one that like is the political stuff or the money stuff and all that or egos.

1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:50.160
 And I think that's probably what Perlman is as well.

1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:53.680
 Like the moment he senses there's any, as with the Fields Medal,

1:43:53.680 --> 1:43:59.280
 like the moment you start to have any kind of drama around credit assignment,

1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:03.600
 all those kinds of things, it's almost not that it's important who gets the credit.

1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:07.600
 It's like the drama in itself gets in the way of the exploration of the ideas

1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:11.760
 or the fundamental thing that makes science so damn beautiful.

1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:17.280
 And you can really see that there's also a product of that Russian school of like doing science.

1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:23.920
 And you can see that, that people were, during the Cold War, a lot of mathematicians,

1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:25.840
 they were not making any money.

1:44:25.840 --> 1:44:31.040
 They were doing math for the sake of math, like for the intellectual pleasure

1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:33.040
 of like solving a difficult problem.

1:44:33.040 --> 1:44:37.920
 And even if it was a flawed system and there were a lot of problems with that,

1:44:37.920 --> 1:44:45.920
 they were able to actually achieve these and Perlman for me is the perfect product of that.

1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:49.280
 He just cared about like working on tough problems.

1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:50.560
 He didn't care about anything else.

1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:53.680
 It was just math, pure math.

1:44:53.680 --> 1:45:02.160
 Yeah, there's like for the broader audience, I think another example of that is like professional sports versus Olympics.

1:45:02.160 --> 1:45:08.720
 Especially in Russia, I've seen that clear distinction where because the state manages

1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:14.800
 so much of the Olympic process in Russia, as people know with the steroids, yes, yes, yes.

1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:25.280
 But outside of the steroids thing is like the athlete can focus on the pure artistry of the sport.

1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:30.960
 Like not worry about the money, not just in the way they talk about it, the way they think about it,

1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:37.760
 the way they define excellence versus like in the perhaps a bit of a capitalist system

1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:42.640
 in the United States with American football, with baseball, with basketball.

1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:47.120
 So much of the discussion is about money.

1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:52.080
 Now, of course, at the end of the day, it's about excellence and artistry and all that.

1:45:52.080 --> 1:46:01.680
 But when the culture is so richly grounded in discussions of money and sort of this capitalistic like

1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:08.880
 merch and businesses and all those kinds of things, it changes the nature of the activity.

1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:15.360
 In a way that's hard again to describe in words, but when it's purely about the activity itself,

1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:23.600
 it's almost like you quiet down all the noise enough to hear the signal, enough to hear the beauty.

1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:28.560
 Like whenever you're talking about the money, that's when the marketing people come and the

1:46:28.560 --> 1:46:33.200
 business people, the non creators come and they fill the room and they create drama and they know

1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:37.920
 how to create the drama and the noise as opposed to the people who are truly excellent at what they

1:46:37.920 --> 1:46:46.960
 do, the person in their arena, right? Like when you remove all the money and you just let that

1:46:46.960 --> 1:46:53.760
 thing shine, that's when true excellence can come out. And that was of the few things that

1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:59.280
 worked with the communist system in the Soviet Union to me at least as somebody who loves sport

1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:09.040
 and loves mathematics and science, that worked well. Removing the money from the picture.

1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:16.880
 Not that I'm saying poverty is good for science. There's some level in which not worrying about

1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:22.000
 money is good for science. It's a weird, I'm not exactly sure what to make of that because

1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:29.920
 capitalism works really damn well. But it's tricky how to find that balance.

1:47:29.920 --> 1:47:34.240
 One Fields Medalist that is interesting to look at, and I think you mentioned it earlier,

1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:42.080
 but is Cedric Villani, which might be the only Fields Medalist that is also a politician now.

1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:49.440
 But so it's this brilliant French mathematician that won the Fields Medal. And after that,

1:47:49.440 --> 1:47:58.480
 he decided that one of the ways that he could have the biggest leverage in pushing science in

1:47:58.480 --> 1:48:05.040
 the direction that he thinks science should go would be to try to go into politics. And so that's

1:48:05.040 --> 1:48:12.080
 what he did. And he has ran, I'm not sure if he has won any election, but I think he's running for

1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:18.480
 a mayor of Paris or something like that. But it's this brilliant mathematician that before

1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:24.160
 winning the Fields Medal had only been just a brilliant mathematician. But after that,

1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:28.960
 he decided to go into politics to try to have an impact and try to change some of the things that

1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:35.040
 he would complain about before. So there's that component as well.

1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:40.720
 Yeah. And I've always thought mathematics and science should be like, James Bond

1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:48.080
 would, in my eyes, I think be sexier if he did math. We should, as a society, put

1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:53.920
 excellence in mathematics at the same level as being able to kill a man with your bare hands.

1:48:53.920 --> 1:49:01.200
 Those are both useful features. That's admirable. It's like, oh, that makes the person interesting.

1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:07.200
 Being extremely well read about history or philosophy, being good at mathematics, being

1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:12.240
 able to kill a man with bare hands. Those are all the same in my book. So I think all are useful

1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:18.240
 for action stars. And I think a society will benefit for giving more value to that. One of

1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:26.080
 the things that bothers me about American culture is the, I don't know the right words to use,

1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:36.160
 but the nerdiness associated with science. I don't think nerd is a good word in American

1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:43.840
 culture because it's seen as weakness. There's images that come with that. And it's fine. You

1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:52.640
 could be all kinds of shapes and colors and personalities, but to me, having sophisticated

1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:59.680
 knowledge of science, being good at math, doesn't mean you're weak. In fact, it could be the very

1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:06.880
 opposite. And so it's an interesting thing because it was very much differently viewed in the Soviet

1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:13.040
 Union. So I know for sure as an existence proof that it doesn't have to be that way.

1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:23.040
 I also feel like we lack a lot of role models. If you ask people to mention one mathematician

1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:29.520
 that they know that he's alive today, I think a lot of people would struggle to answer that question.

1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:40.720
 And I also think, I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. But there is, having more role models is good,

1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:47.840
 like different kinds of personalities. He has kind of fun and it's like Bill Nye the

1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:55.760
 science guy. I don't know if you guys know him. But Feynman is no longer there.

1:50:57.200 --> 1:51:03.680
 Those kinds of personalities. Carl Sagan, man. Even Carl Sagan, yeah. A seriousness that's not

1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:09.920
 playful. Not apologetical. Yeah, exactly. Not apologetic about being knowledgeable.

1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:22.400
 In fact, the kind of energy where you feel self conscious about not having thought about

1:51:22.400 --> 1:51:27.840
 some of these questions. Just like when I see James Bond, I feel bad about that I don't

1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:33.280
 have never killed a man. I need to make sure I fix that. That's the way I feel. So the same

1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:37.920
 way I want to feel like that way. Well, Carl Sagan talks, I feel like I need to have that

1:51:37.920 --> 1:51:42.640
 same kind of seriousness about science. Like if I don't know something, I want to know it well.

1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:48.080
 What about Terence Tao? He's kind of a superstar. What are your thoughts about him?

1:51:48.080 --> 1:51:52.480
 True. It's probably one of the most famous mathematicians alive today. And probably one of

1:51:52.480 --> 1:52:00.560
 I mean, regardless of like, is of course, he won a Fields Medal, is really smart and talented

1:52:00.560 --> 1:52:09.600
 mathematician. It's also like a big inspiration for us, at least for some of the work that we

1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:15.840
 do with Formaz Library. So Terence Tao is known for having, you know, a big blog and is pretty open

1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:24.480
 about like his research and he also he tries to make his work as public as possible through his

1:52:24.480 --> 1:52:31.600
 blog posts. In fact, there's a really interesting problem that got solved a couple of years ago.

1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:37.760
 So Tao was working with on a problem on an Erdos problem, actually. So Paul Erdos was this

1:52:38.800 --> 1:52:45.600
 mathematician from Hungary. And he was known for like the Erdos for a lot of things. But

1:52:45.600 --> 1:52:49.680
 one of the things that he was also known was for the Erdos problem. So he was always like

1:52:50.320 --> 1:52:53.920
 creating these problems and usually associating prizes with those problems.

1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:59.280
 And a lot of those problems are still open. And some of them will be open for like maybe

1:53:00.080 --> 1:53:04.480
 a couple of hundred years. And I think that's actually an interesting hack for him to collaborate

1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:11.440
 with future mathematicians. You know, his name will keep coming up for future generations. But so

1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:16.640
 Tao was working on one of these problems called the Erdos discrepancy. And he published a blog

1:53:16.640 --> 1:53:23.920
 post on like about that problem about that problem. And he reached it like a dead end. And then all of

1:53:23.920 --> 1:53:29.680
 a sudden there was this guy from Germany that wrote like a comment on his blog post saying,

1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:35.600
 okay, like some of the so this problem is like a Sudoku like flavor and some of the machinery

1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:41.040
 that we're using to solve Sudoku could be used here. And that was actually the key to solve the

1:53:41.040 --> 1:53:46.400
 Erdos discrepancy problem. So there was a comment on his blog. And I think that that that for me is

1:53:46.400 --> 1:53:53.360
 an example of like how to do again, going back to collaborative science online, and the power that

1:53:53.360 --> 1:54:02.080
 it has. But Tao is also like pretty public about like some of the struggles and of being a mathematician,

1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:08.800
 like and even he wrote about some of the unintended consequences of having extraordinary

1:54:08.800 --> 1:54:14.400
 ability in a field. And he used himself as an example when he was growing up, he was extremely

1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:21.360
 talented in mathematics from a young age like Tao was a person he won an medal in like one of the

1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:26.640
 IMOs at the age I think was a gold medal at the age of 10 or something like that. And so he mentioned

1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:32.320
 that when he was growing up, like and especially in college, when he was in a class that he enjoyed,

1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:38.480
 it didn't it just came very natural for him and it didn't have to work hard to just ace the class.

1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:44.720
 And when he found that the class was boring, like it didn't work and he barely passed, barely passed

1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:51.680
 I think in college he almost failed two classes. And he was talking about that and how he brought

1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:57.600
 those studying habits or like in existence of studying habits when he went to Princeton for

1:54:57.600 --> 1:55:04.480
 his PhD. And in Princeton, when he started kind of delving into more complex problems

1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:10.480
 in classes, he struggled a lot because he didn't have that those those habits like it wasn't taking

1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:16.080
 notes and it was it wasn't studying hard when he when he faced problems. And he almost failed out of

1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:23.680
 his PhD. He almost failed his PhD exam. And it talks about like having this conversation with

1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:29.360
 this advisor and the advisor pointing out like you're not this is not working, you might have to get

1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:36.400
 out of the program. And like how that was a kind of a turning point for him. And like it was super

1:55:36.400 --> 1:55:41.600
 important in his career. So I think Tao is also like this figure that apart from being just an

1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:47.040
 exceptional mathematician is also pretty open about what what it takes to to to be a mathematician

1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:51.440
 and some of the struggles of these type of careers. And I think it's that's super important.

1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:58.240
 In many ways, he's a contributor to open science and open humanity. He's being an open human.

1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:04.960
 True. By communicating Scott Aronson is another in computer science world who's a very different

1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:11.120
 style, very different style. But there's something about a blog that is authentic and real and just

1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:17.440
 gives us a window into the into the mind and soul of all of these brilliant folks. So it's

1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:24.640
 definitely a gift. Let me ask you about Fermat's library on Twitter, which I mean, I don't know

1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:29.520
 how to describe it, people should definitely just follow from my library on Twitter. I keep

1:56:29.520 --> 1:56:39.440
 following and unfollowing from my library because because it's so it gives when I follow it leads

1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:50.720
 me on down rabbit holes often that that are very fruitful. But anyway, so the the posts you do

1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:56.720
 with the on Twitter are just these beautiful are things that reveal some beautiful aspect of

1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:05.920
 mathematics. Is there is there something you could say about the approach there? Yeah. And maybe

1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:13.520
 maybe broadly what you find beautiful about mathematics and then more specifically how

1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:19.200
 you convert that into a rigorous process of revealing that in tweet form.

1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:24.080
 That's a good point. I think there's something about math that, you know, a lot of the mathematical

1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:31.920
 content and you know, paid papers or like little proofs, you know, has in a way sort of an infinite

1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:38.480
 off life. What I mean by that is that if you look at like Euclid's elements, it's as valid today as

1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:44.240
 it was when he was created like 2000 years ago. And that's not true for a lot of other scientific

1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:54.480
 fields. And so in regards to Twitter, I think there's also a very it's a very undexed underexplored

1:57:54.480 --> 1:58:01.040
 platform from a learning perspective. I think if you look at content on Twitter, it's very easy to

1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:09.680
 consume. It's very easy to read. And especially when you're trying to explain something, you know,

1:58:09.680 --> 1:58:16.880
 we humans get a dopamine hit if we learn something new. And that's a very, very powerful feeling.

1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:22.080
 And that's why, you know, people go to classes when you have a really good professor, you know,

1:58:22.080 --> 1:58:29.360
 it's looking for those dopamine hits. And that's something that we try to explore when

1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:34.560
 we're producing content on Twitter. Imagine if we could, if you would on a line to a restaurant,

1:58:34.560 --> 1:58:40.720
 you could go to your phone to learn something new instead of going to a, you know, social network.

1:58:41.920 --> 1:58:49.680
 And so, and I think it's very hard to sometimes to kind of provide that feeling because you need to

1:58:50.400 --> 1:58:58.400
 sometimes digest content and put it in a way, you know, that it feeds 280 characters. And it

1:58:58.400 --> 1:59:04.160
 requires a lot of sometimes time to do that, even though it's easy to consume, it's hard to make.

1:59:04.160 --> 1:59:10.080
 But once you are able to provide that eureka moment to people, like that's very powerful,

1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:15.840
 they get that dopamine hit and like you create this feedback cycle and people come back for more.

1:59:15.840 --> 1:59:20.560
 And in Twitter, compared to like, you know, an online course for a book, you have a 0%

1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:27.040
 dropout. So people will read the content. So that it's like, it's part of the creators,

1:59:27.040 --> 1:59:31.600
 like the person that is creating the content, if you're able to actually get that feedback cycle,

1:59:31.600 --> 1:59:37.440
 it's super, super powerful. Yeah. But some of this stuff is like, like, how the heck do you find

1:59:37.440 --> 1:59:46.720
 that? And I don't know why it's so appealing. Like, this is from a, what is it? A couple days ago,

1:59:47.360 --> 1:59:53.760
 I'll just read out the number 23456789 is the largest prime number with consecutive

1:59:53.760 --> 2:00:02.720
 increasing digits. I mean, that is so cool. That's like some weird like glimpse into some

2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:09.040
 deep universal truth, even though it's just a number. I mean, that's like so arbitrary. Like,

2:00:09.040 --> 2:00:14.240
 why, why is it so pleasant that that's a thing, but it is in some way, it's almost like it is

2:00:14.240 --> 2:00:21.440
 a little glimpse at some much bigger, like. And I think like, especially if we're talking about

2:00:21.440 --> 2:00:26.800
 science, there's something unique about you go and with a lot of the tweets, you go sometimes from

2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:32.160
 a state of not knowing something to knowing something. And that is very particular to science,

2:00:32.160 --> 2:00:38.240
 science, math, physics. And that, again, is extra extremely addictive. And that's that's how I feel

2:00:38.240 --> 2:00:45.200
 about that. And that's why I think people engage so much with our tweets and go into rabbit holes.

2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:50.000
 And then they, you know, we start with prime numbers. And all of a sudden, you are spending hours

2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:55.760
 reading number theory things, and you go into Wikipedia. And it was a lot of time there.

2:00:56.800 --> 2:01:01.440
 Well, the variety is really interesting, too. There's human things. There's, there's physics

2:01:01.440 --> 2:01:07.760
 things. There's like numeric things, like I just mentioned, but there's also more rigorous

2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:12.640
 mathematical things. There's stuff that's tied to the history of math and the proofs. And

2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:17.840
 there's visual, there's animations. There are looping animations that are incredible,

2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:24.400
 that reveal something. There's Andrew Wiles on being smart. This is just me now, like,

2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:29.920
 ignoring you guys and just going through. No, yeah, we're a bit like math drug dealers. We're

2:01:29.920 --> 2:01:34.720
 just trying to get you hooked. We're trying to give you that hit and trying to get you hooked.

2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:39.040
 Yes, some people are brighter than others. But I really believe that most people can really get

2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:44.000
 to to quite a good level of mathematics if they're prepared to deal with these

2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:47.600
 psychological issues of how to handle the situation of being stuck.

2:01:47.600 --> 2:01:51.600
 Yeah, there's some truth to that. That's truth. I feel that's like really,

2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:57.840
 that's some truth in terms of research and also about startups. You're stuck a lot of the time

2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:03.440
 before you get to a breakthrough. And it's difficult to endure that process of like being stuck

2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:09.360
 because you're not trying to to be in that position. I feel, yeah, that's

2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:13.760
 Yeah, most people are broken by the stuckness or like their district. Like,

2:02:13.760 --> 2:02:22.480
 uh, I've been very cognizant of the fact that more and more social media becomes a thing.

2:02:24.080 --> 2:02:30.480
 Like distractions become a thing that that moment of being stuck is your mind wants to

2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:36.720
 to go do stuff that's unrelated to being stuck and you should be stuck. I'm referring to small

2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:42.480
 stucknesses. Like you're like trying to design something and it's a dead end, basically little

2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:47.600
 dead ends, dead ends and programming dead ends and trying to think through something. And then

2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:54.640
 your mind wants to like, like, like, uh, this is the problem with this like work life balance

2:02:54.640 --> 2:03:01.840
 culture is like take a break. Like as if taking a break will solve everything. Sometimes it solves

2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:06.080
 quite a bit, but like sometimes you need to sit in the stuckness and suffer a little bit and then

2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:13.600
 take a break. But you definitely need to be and like most people quit from that psychological

2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:20.720
 battle of being stuck. So success is people who, who, who, uh, persevere through that.

2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:26.000
 Yeah. Yeah. And in the creative process, that's also true. I was the other day I was, I think

2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:30.880
 was reading about this. What is his name? Ed Sheeran, like the musician was talking a little

2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:35.360
 bit about the creative process and using was using this analogy of a faucet, like

2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:39.920
 where you, when you turn on a faucet is as like the dirty water coming out in the beginning.

2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:46.160
 And you just have to, you know, keep trusting that at some point you're clean, clean, clear water

2:03:46.160 --> 2:03:50.880
 will come out, but you have to endure that process. Like in the beginning it's going to be dirty water

2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:56.880
 and, and, and just, you know, embrace that. Yeah. Actually this, uh, the entirety of my

2:03:56.880 --> 2:04:01.840
 YouTube channel and this podcast have been following that philosophy of dirty water.

2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:07.120
 Like I've been, you know, I do believe that like you have to get all the crap out of your system

2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:13.200
 first. And uh, sometimes it's all, it's all, sometimes it's all crappy work. I mean, I tend

2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:18.240
 to be very self critical, but I do think that quantity leads the quality for some people.

2:04:18.240 --> 2:04:23.680
 It does for my, the way my mind works is like just keep putting stuff out there, keep creating

2:04:23.680 --> 2:04:31.520
 and, uh, the quality will come as opposed to sitting there waiting, not doing anything until

2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:34.720
 the thing seems perfect because the perfect may never come.

2:04:35.840 --> 2:04:41.120
 But just, just on like, on, on, on our Twitter, uh, like profile, I really, and sometimes when

2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:46.560
 you look on, on some of those tweets, they might seem like pretty kind of, um, you know,

2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:52.160
 why is this interesting? It's like so raw, uh, like it's just a number. But I really believe

2:04:52.160 --> 2:04:58.400
 that especially with math or physics, it is possible to get everyone to love math or physics,

2:04:58.400 --> 2:05:03.120
 even if you think you hate it. It's, it's not a function of the student or the person that is

2:05:03.120 --> 2:05:08.480
 on the other side. I think it's just purely a function of like how you explain, uh, hidden

2:05:08.480 --> 2:05:14.400
 beauty that they hadn't realized before. It's not easy, but I think it's like a lot of the times

2:05:14.400 --> 2:05:20.480
 is on, like on the creator side to, to be able to like show that beauty to the other person.

2:05:20.480 --> 2:05:25.680
 I think some of that is native to, to humans. We just have that curiosity and you look at

2:05:25.680 --> 2:05:30.560
 small toddlers and babies and like them trying to figure things out. And there's just something

2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:35.360
 that is born with us that we, we, we want for that understanding. We want to figure out the

2:05:35.360 --> 2:05:40.960
 world around us. And, and so yeah, it shouldn't be like, uh, whether or not people are going,

2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:47.920
 are going to, to enjoy it. Like I also really believe that everybody has that capacity to

2:05:47.920 --> 2:05:54.000
 fall in love with, with math and physics. You mentioned startup. What do you think it takes

2:05:54.000 --> 2:06:01.440
 to build a successful startup? Yeah, that it's what, what Louise was saying that, um, you need to

2:06:01.440 --> 2:06:07.520
 end, to be able to endure being stuck. And, and I think the best way to put it is that startups

2:06:08.400 --> 2:06:15.520
 don't have a linear reward function, right? You oftentimes don't get rewarded for effort.

2:06:15.520 --> 2:06:23.840
 And, and, and in most of our lives, we go through these processes that do give you those small

2:06:23.840 --> 2:06:27.760
 rewards for effort, right? In school, you study hard, generally you'll get a good grade. And

2:06:27.760 --> 2:06:32.800
 then you get, you get like good grades ever, or you get grades every semester. And so you're,

2:06:32.800 --> 2:06:39.840
 you're slowly getting rewarded and pushed in the right direction for, for startups. And startups

2:06:39.840 --> 2:06:44.640
 are not the only thing that is like this, but for startups, it's, you know, you can put in a ton of

2:06:44.640 --> 2:06:50.240
 effort into something that, and then get no reward for it, right? It's, it's like, like Sisyphus

2:06:50.240 --> 2:06:56.240
 Boulder, where you were pushing that Boulder up the mountain and, and, and you get to the top

2:06:56.240 --> 2:07:00.960
 and then it just rolls all the way back down. And, and so that's something that I think a lot of

2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:07.440
 people are not equipped to deal with and can be incredibly demoralizing, especially if that happens

2:07:07.440 --> 2:07:14.000
 more than, than a few times. And so, but I think it's absolutely essential to, to power through it,

2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:19.200
 because by the nature of startups, it's often times, you know, you're dealing with, with,

2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:26.800
 with non obvious ideas and things that, that might be contrarian. And so you're gonna, you're

2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:31.360
 gonna run into, into that a lot. You're gonna do things that are not going to work out. And you

2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:36.880
 need to be prepared to deal with that. But, but if we're not coming out of college, you're, you're

2:07:36.880 --> 2:07:42.640
 just not equipped. I'm not sure if there's a way to train people to deal with those non linear

2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:47.600
 reward functions, but it's definitely, I think, one of the most difficult things to, you know,

2:07:48.640 --> 2:07:52.720
 about doing a startup. And also happens in research. Sometimes, you know, we're talking

2:07:52.720 --> 2:07:57.280
 about the default state is being stuck. You just, you know, you don't know, like you try things,

2:07:57.280 --> 2:08:02.240
 you get zero results, you close doors, you constantly closing doors, until you, you know,

2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:08.880
 find something. And yeah, that is a big thing. What about sort of this point when you're stuck,

2:08:08.880 --> 2:08:14.960
 there's a kind of decision, whether you, if you have a vision to persist through, through with

2:08:14.960 --> 2:08:19.600
 this direction that you've been going along, or what a lot of startups do or businesses pivot.

2:08:21.280 --> 2:08:29.040
 How do you decide whether like, to give up on a particular flavor of the way you've imagined

2:08:29.040 --> 2:08:34.720
 the design, and to like, adjust it or completely, like, alter it.

2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:40.640
 I think that's a core question for startups that I've asked myself exactly. And like, I've never

2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:46.160
 been able to come up with a great framework to make those decisions. I think that's really at the

2:08:46.160 --> 2:08:53.360
 core of, yeah, out of a lot of the toughest questions that, that people that's that started a

2:08:53.360 --> 2:09:00.720
 company have to deal with. I think maybe the best framework that I was able to figure out is like,

2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:05.920
 I was able to figure out is like, when you run out of ideas, you just, you know, you're exploring

2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:11.040
 something is not working, you try it in a different angle, you know, we try different business model.

2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:18.880
 When you run out of ideas, like, you don't have any more cards, just switch and yeah, it's not

2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:23.440
 perfect. Because you also, it's, you have a lot of stories of startups was like,

2:09:23.440 --> 2:09:30.640
 people kept pushing, and then, you know, that paid off. And then you have philosophies is like,

2:09:30.640 --> 2:09:37.920
 fell fast, and pivot fast. So it's, you know, it's hard to, you know, balance these two worlds

2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:43.280
 and understand what is the best framework. And I mean, if you look at Fermat's library, you're,

2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:48.080
 maybe you can correct me, but it feels like you're an operating in a space

2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:55.280
 where there's a lot of things that are broken, and or could be significantly improved. So it

2:09:55.280 --> 2:10:01.200
 feels like there's a lot of possibilities for pivoting. Or like, how do you revolutionize

2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:09.360
 science? How do you revolutionize the aggregation, the, the annotation, the commenting the community

2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:13.840
 around information of knowledge, structured knowledge? I mean, that's kind of what like

2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:19.520
 Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange has struggled with to come up with a solution. And they've come

2:10:19.520 --> 2:10:24.160
 up, I think with an interesting set of solutions, that are also, I think flawed in some ways,

2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:29.680
 but they're much, much better than the alternatives. But there's a lot of other possibilities. If we

2:10:29.680 --> 2:10:34.000
 just look at papers, as we talked about, there's so many possible revolutions, and there are a lot

2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:39.840
 of money to be potentially made as revolutions, plus coupled with that, the benefit to humanity.

2:10:39.840 --> 2:10:45.600
 And so like, you're sitting there, like, I don't know how many people are legitimately,

2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:50.320
 from a business perspective, playing with these ideas. It feels like there's a lot of ideas here.

2:10:50.320 --> 2:10:51.360
 True. There is.

2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:56.640
 Are you right now grinding in a particular direction? Like, is there a like a five year

2:10:56.640 --> 2:11:02.080
 vision that you're thinking in your mind? For us, it's more like a 20 year vision,

2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:10.720
 in the sense that we've consciously tried to make the decision of, so we run Formats as

2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:15.840
 it's a side project. And it's a separate in the sense like it's not what we're working on full

2:11:15.840 --> 2:11:24.240
 time. And, but our thesis there is that we actually think that it's that's a good thing,

2:11:24.240 --> 2:11:29.920
 at least for this stage of Formats library. And also because some of these projects,

2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:39.680
 you just, if you're coming from a start, from a startup framework, you probably try to try to fit

2:11:39.680 --> 2:11:44.800
 every single idea into something that can change the world within three to five years. And there's

2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:49.120
 just some problems that take longer than that. Right. And so, you know, we're talking about

2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:55.600
 archive, and I'm very doubtful that you could grow like archive into what it is today, like within

2:11:55.600 --> 2:11:59.920
 two or three years, no matter how much money you throw at it, there's just some things that can

2:11:59.920 --> 2:12:07.360
 take longer. But you need to be able to power through the time that it takes. But if you look

2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:11.120
 at it as it's okay, this is a company, this is a startup, we have to grow fast, we have to raise

2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:18.800
 money, then then sometimes you might forgo those ideas because of that, because they don't very

2:12:18.800 --> 2:12:26.560
 well fit into the typical startup framework. And so, for us, Formats, it's something that we're

2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:33.280
 okay with growing, with having it grow slowly, and maybe taking many years. And that's why we

2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:40.400
 think it's not a bad thing that it is a side project, because it makes it much more acceptable

2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:47.920
 in a way to be able to be okay with that. That said, I think what happens is if you keep pushing

2:12:47.920 --> 2:12:53.280
 new little features, new little ideas, I'd feel like there's like certain ideas will just become

2:12:53.280 --> 2:12:59.520
 viral. And then you just won't be able to help yourself, but it'll revolutionize things. It

2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:07.600
 feels like there needs to be, not needs to be, but there's opportunity for viral ideas to change

2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:13.040
 science. Absolutely. And maybe we don't know what those are yet. It might be a very small kind of

2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:18.000
 thing. Maybe you don't even know if should this be a for profit company doing these? It's the

2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:24.080
 Wikipedia question. Yeah. There are a lot of questions, like really fundamental questions

2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:29.440
 about this space that we've talked about. I mean, you take Wikipedia and you try to run it as a

2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:34.320
 startup, and by now, we'd have a paywall, you'd be paying $9.99 a month to read more than $20.

2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:41.440
 I mean, that's one view. The other, the ad driven model, so they rejected the ad driven model.

2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:46.400
 I don't know if we could, I mean, this is a difficult question, you know,

2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:52.880
 if archive was supported by ads, I don't know if that's bad for archive. If Fermat's library was

2:13:52.880 --> 2:13:59.360
 supported by ads, I don't know. I don't, I'm not, it's not trivial to me. I'm, unlike I think a lot

2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:06.000
 of people, I'm not against advertisements. I think ads when done well are really good. I think the

2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:10.960
 problem with Facebook and all the social networks are the way, the lack of transparency around the

2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:16.480
 way they use data, and the lack of control the users have over their data, not the fact that

2:14:16.480 --> 2:14:21.360
 data is being collected and used to sell advertisements. It's a lack of transparency,

2:14:21.360 --> 2:14:25.920
 lack of control. If you, if you do a good job of that, I feel like it's really nice way to make

2:14:25.920 --> 2:14:32.720
 stuff free. Yeah, it's like Stack Overflow, right? I think they've done a good job with that,

2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:37.120
 even though as we said, like they're capturing very little of the value that they're putting out

2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:44.160
 there, right? But, but it makes it a sustainable company, and they're providing a lot of, it's a

2:14:44.160 --> 2:14:50.640
 fantastic and very productive community. Let me ask a ridiculous tangent of a question.

2:14:50.640 --> 2:14:58.000
 Louise, you wrote a paper on Game of Thrones, Battle of Winterfell, just as a side, I'm sorry,

2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:01.920
 I noticed, I'm sure you've done a lot of ridiculous stuff like this. I just noticed that particular

2:15:01.920 --> 2:15:08.160
 one by ridiculous, I mean, ridiculous, the awesome. Can you describe the approach in this work,

2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:14.400
 which I believe is a legitimate publication? So going back to the original, like when we were

2:15:14.400 --> 2:15:18.880
 talking about the backstory of papers and the importance of that, so this is actually, you

2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:25.760
 know, there was a, when the last season of the show was airing, this was a during a company

2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:34.320
 lunch, there was, in the last season, there's a really big battle against the forces of evil

2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:42.080
 and the forces of good, and it's called the Battle of Winterfell. And in this battle,

2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:46.800
 there are like these two armies, and there's a very particular thing that they have to take

2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:52.320
 into account is that in the army of death, like if someone dies in the army of the living,

2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:59.600
 like that person is going to, you know, be reborn as a soldier in the army of the dead.

2:15:59.600 --> 2:16:03.760
 And so that was an important thing to take into account. And the initial conditions,

2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:08.800
 as you specified, it's about 100,000 on each side. Exactly. So I was able to, like, based on

2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:12.640
 some images, like on previous episodes, to figure out what was the size of the armies.

2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:18.320
 And so what I want, what we wanted to, what we were theorizing was like, how many soldiers does,

2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:25.680
 like, a soldier on the army of the living has to kill in order for them to be able to destroy

2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:31.760
 the army of the dead without, like, losing, because every time one of the good soldiers dies,

2:16:31.760 --> 2:16:37.280
 going to turn into, like, the other side. And so it's, so we were theorizing that, and I wrote

2:16:37.280 --> 2:16:42.800
 a couple of differential equations, and I was able to figure out that based on the size of the armies,

2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:49.200
 I think, I think was the ratio had to be, like, 1.7. So it had to kill, like, 1.7 soldiers of,

2:16:49.200 --> 2:16:54.880
 like, the army of the dead in order for them to win the battle. Well, yeah, that's science,

2:16:54.880 --> 2:17:04.240
 it's the most powerful. And this is also somehow a pitch for, like, a hiring pitch, in a sense,

2:17:04.240 --> 2:17:09.440
 like, this is the kind of important science you do at lunch. Exactly. Well, it turned out to be,

2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:15.520
 you know, as for people that have watched these shows, they know that every time you try to predict

2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:19.520
 something that is going to happen, you're going to fail miserably, and that's what happens. So it

2:17:19.520 --> 2:17:25.920
 was not at all important for the show, but we ended up, like, putting that out, and there

2:17:25.920 --> 2:17:29.920
 was a lot of people that shared that. And I think it was some, like, elements of the show,

2:17:29.920 --> 2:17:34.720
 the cast of the show, that actually retweeted that and shared that. That person was fun.

2:17:34.720 --> 2:17:41.280
 I would love if this kind of calculation happened, like, during the making of the show, or, you know,

2:17:41.280 --> 2:17:48.560
 I love it, like, in, for example, I now know Alex Garland, the director of Ex Machina,

2:17:49.200 --> 2:17:55.440
 and I love it, and he doesn't seem to be some, not many people seem to do this, but I love it

2:17:55.440 --> 2:18:01.840
 when directors and people who wrote the story really think through the technical details,

2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:06.160
 like, whether it's knowing, like, how things, even if it's science fiction,

2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:11.920
 if you were to try to do this, how would you do this? Like, Stephen Wolfram and his son were,

2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:18.560
 were collaborating with the movie Arrival in designing the alien language of how you

2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:25.680
 communicate with aliens. Like, how would you really have a math based language that could

2:18:25.680 --> 2:18:33.360
 span the alien and being and the human being? So, I love it when they have that kind of rigor.

2:18:33.360 --> 2:18:37.760
 The Martian was also big on that, like, the book in the movie was all about, like, can we actually,

2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:42.320
 is this plausible? Can this happen? It was all about that.

2:18:42.320 --> 2:18:47.200
 And that can really bring you in, like, sometimes those small details. I mean,

2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:52.560
 the guy that wrote the Martian book is another book that is also filled with those, like,

2:18:52.560 --> 2:18:58.880
 things that when you realize that, okay, these are grounded in science can just really bring you

2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:03.120
 in. Yeah. Like, he has a book about a colony on the moon.

2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:06.800
 A colony on the moon. And he goes about, like, all the details that would, you know,

2:19:06.800 --> 2:19:11.680
 be required about setting up a colony in the moon and, like, things that he wouldn't think about,

2:19:11.680 --> 2:19:18.640
 like, the fact that they would, you know, it's hard to bring, like, air to the moon so they wouldn't,

2:19:18.640 --> 2:19:23.760
 like, how do you make that breathable, that environment breathable? You need to bring oxygen.

2:19:23.760 --> 2:19:29.840
 But, like, you probably wouldn't bring nitrogen. So, what you do is, like, instead of having an

2:19:31.280 --> 2:19:36.480
 atmosphere that is 100% oxygen, you, like, decrease the pressure so that you have the

2:19:36.480 --> 2:19:41.280
 same ratio of oxygen on Earth, but, like, lowering the pressure here. And so, like,

2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:47.360
 things like water boils at the lower temperature. So, people would have coffee and the coffee would

2:19:47.360 --> 2:19:52.640
 be colder. Like, there was a problem in this environment in the moon. So, like, and these

2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:57.680
 are, like, small things in the book. But I studied physics. So, like, when I read these,

2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:04.640
 that throws me into, like, tangents. And I start researching that. And it's like,

2:20:04.640 --> 2:20:11.920
 I really like to read books and watch movies when they go to that level of detail about science.

2:20:11.920 --> 2:20:15.680
 Yeah. I think Interstellar was one where they also consulted heavily with the number of

2:20:15.680 --> 2:20:22.080
 these. And I think even resulted in a couple of papers about, like, the black hole visualizations.

2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:28.080
 Yeah. And there's even more examples of interesting science around, like, these

2:20:28.080 --> 2:20:34.000
 fantasy. We were reading at some point, like, these guys that were trying to figure out if

2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:42.800
 the Tolkien's Middle Earth, if it was round, if it was, like, a sphere, if it was, like, a flat

2:20:42.800 --> 2:20:49.440
 flat. Based on the map. Based on the map and some of the references in the books. And so,

2:20:50.240 --> 2:20:54.080
 yeah, we actually, I think we tweeted about that. Yeah, we did. Based on the distance

2:20:54.080 --> 2:20:59.120
 between the cities, you can actually prove that that could be, like, a map of a sphere,

2:20:59.120 --> 2:21:03.760
 or, like, a spheroid. And you can actually calculate the radius of that planet.

2:21:03.760 --> 2:21:11.600
 That's fascinating. I mean, yeah, that's fascinating. But there's something about,

2:21:11.600 --> 2:21:20.320
 like, calculating the number, like, exactly the calculation you did for the Battle of Winterfell

2:21:20.320 --> 2:21:27.120
 is something fascinating about that. Because it's not, like, being, that's very mathematical,

2:21:27.120 --> 2:21:31.440
 versus, like, grounded in physics. And that's really interesting. I mean,

2:21:31.440 --> 2:21:38.800
 that's like injecting mathematics into fantasy. There's something magical about that.

2:21:38.800 --> 2:21:43.200
 I see what you're saying. And that, for me, that's why I think it's also when you look at things like

2:21:44.880 --> 2:21:50.560
 Fermat's last theorem, like, problems that are very kind of self contained and simple to state.

2:21:50.560 --> 2:21:54.560
 I think, like, that's the same with that paper. It's very easy to understand the boundaries

2:21:54.560 --> 2:22:03.040
 of the problem. And that, for me, that's why math is so appealing. And those, like,

2:22:03.040 --> 2:22:07.680
 problems are also so appealing to the general public. It's not that they look simple, or that

2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:13.040
 people think that they're easy to, like, solve. But I feel that a lot of the times they are

2:22:13.680 --> 2:22:18.240
 almost intellectually democratic, because everyone understands the starting point.

2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:24.000
 You know, you look at Fermat's last theorem, everyone understands, like, this is the universe

2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:27.600
 of the problem. And the same maybe with that paper, everyone understands, okay, these are the

2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:34.640
 starting conditions. And, yeah, the fact that it becomes intellectually democratic, and I think

2:22:34.640 --> 2:22:40.160
 that's a huge motivation for people. And that's why so many people gravitate towards these, like,

2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:44.560
 Riemann hypotheses, or Fermat's last theorem, or that simple paper, which is, like, just one page.

2:22:44.560 --> 2:22:48.880
 It was very simple. And I just talked to somebody, I don't know if you know who he is,

2:22:48.880 --> 2:22:58.080
 Jaco Willink, who was this person who, among many things, loves military tactics. So he would

2:22:58.080 --> 2:23:04.000
 probably either publish a follow on paper, maybe you guys should collaborate. But he would see the

2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:08.960
 fundamental, the basic assumptions that he started that paper with is flawed. Because, you know,

2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:13.920
 there's like dragons, too, right? There's like, like, you have to integrate tactics. Because

2:23:13.920 --> 2:23:19.040
 it's not, it's not, it's not a homogeneous system. It's not, I don't take into account the dragons

2:23:19.040 --> 2:23:24.400
 and like, and he would say tactics fundamentally change the dynamics of the system. And so like,

2:23:24.400 --> 2:23:31.360
 that's what happened. So, yeah, so at least from a scientific perspective, he was right,

2:23:31.360 --> 2:23:36.480
 but he never published. So there you go. Let me ask the most important question. You guys are from

2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:44.320
 Portugal, both in Portugal. So who is the greatest soccer player, footballer of all time?

2:23:45.520 --> 2:23:53.040
 Yeah, I think we're a little bit biased on this topic. But I mean, I have a huge,

2:23:53.040 --> 2:23:56.880
 I have a tremendous respect for what. Here we go.

2:23:59.840 --> 2:24:05.200
 You can convince me. I mean, I have tremendous respect for what Ronaldo has achieved in his

2:24:05.200 --> 2:24:09.840
 career. And I think soccer is one of those sports where I think you can get to maybe be

2:24:09.840 --> 2:24:16.160
 one of the best players in the world. We, if you just have like natural talent, and even if you

2:24:16.160 --> 2:24:21.680
 don't put a lot of hard work and discipline into soccer, you can be one of the best players in the

2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:26.560
 world. And I think Ronaldo is kind of like, of course, he's naturally talented, but he also,

2:24:26.560 --> 2:24:33.600
 Ronaldo would say the football from exactly from Portugal and not the Brazilian in this case.

2:24:33.600 --> 2:24:40.000
 And so, and Ronaldo came from nothing, he's known from being probably one of the hardest working

2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:45.120
 athletes in the game. And I see that sometimes a lot of these discussions about the best player,

2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:51.760
 a lot of people tend to gravitate towards like, you know, this person is naturally talented,

2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:58.960
 and the other person has to work hard. And so, as if it was bad, if he had to work hard to be

2:24:58.960 --> 2:25:05.920
 good at something. And I think that's, you know, the, I think so many people fall into that trap.

2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:10.800
 And the reason why so many people fall into that trap is because if you're saying that someone

2:25:11.600 --> 2:25:17.440
 is good and achieved a lot of success by working hard, as opposed to achieving success because

2:25:17.440 --> 2:25:22.720
 he has some sort of God given natural talent, that you can't explain why the person was born with

2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:28.560
 that. What does it tell you about you? It tells you that maybe if you work hard on a lot of

2:25:28.560 --> 2:25:33.200
 fields, you could have, could accomplish a lot of great things. And I think that's hard to digest

2:25:33.200 --> 2:25:38.560
 for a lot of people. And in that way, Ronaldo's inspiring that. I think so. So you find hard

2:25:38.560 --> 2:25:45.600
 work inspiring, but he's way too good looking. That's the, I don't like him probably. No, I like

2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:51.040
 the part of the hard work and like, of him being like one of the hardest working athletes in Saga.

2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:56.320
 So he is to you the greatest of all time? Is he up there? Is he will be number one? Okay.

2:25:56.320 --> 2:26:02.800
 Okay. Do you agree with this? Hard or disagree? Well, I definitely disagree. I mean, I like him

2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:12.480
 very much. He works hard. I admire, I admire, you know, would like, he's incredible goal scorer,

2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:21.360
 right? But I, so first of all, Leo Messi, and there was some confusion because I've kept saying

2:26:21.360 --> 2:26:29.680
 Maradona is my favorite player, but I think, I think Leo has surpassed them. So it's messy

2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:38.800
 than Maradona than Pele for me. But the reason is, is there's certain aesthetic definitions of

2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:45.200
 beauty that I admire, whether it came by hard work or through God given talent or through

2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:48.480
 anything. It doesn't, it doesn't really matter to me. There's certain aesthetic,

2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:55.440
 like, like genius when I, when I see it to me, and especially it doesn't have to be consistent.

2:26:55.440 --> 2:27:00.720
 It isn't a case of Messi in case of the Ronaldo, but just even moments of genius,

2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:06.720
 which is where Maradona really shines. It's, I, even if that doesn't translate into like

2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:11.360
 results and goals being scored, right, right? And that's the challenge. I'm like, I did that

2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:20.400
 because that's where people that tell me that Leo Messi is never, even on strong teams have led

2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:25.520
 his, the national team, people as part of the World Cup, right? That's really important. And

2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:31.520
 to me, no, it's the moment, like winning to me was never important. What's more important is the

2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:38.000
 moments of genius. And, but you're, you're talking to the human story. And

2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:42.800
 yeah, Cristiano Ronaldo definitely has the beautiful human story.

2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:49.280
 Yeah. And I think you can't, for me, it's hard to decouple those two. I don't, I don't just look at,

2:27:49.280 --> 2:27:54.080
 you know, the, the list of achievements, but I like how he got there and how he keeps pushing

2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:59.440
 the boundaries at like almost 40. And how that sets up an example. Like maybe 10 years ago,

2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:03.840
 I wouldn't have ever imagined that like one of the top players in the world could be a top

2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:08.320
 player at like 37 or, but so, and there's an interesting tent. The human story is really

2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:14.960
 important. But like, if you look at Ronaldo, he's like, he's somebody like kids could aspire to be.

2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:21.600
 But at the same time, I also like Maradona, who like is a, is a tragic figure in many ways.

2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:27.840
 It's like the, you know, the drugs, the, the temper, all of those things, that's beautiful too.

2:28:27.840 --> 2:28:35.120
 Like I don't necessarily think to me, the flaws are beautiful too in athletes. I don't think

2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:43.120
 you need to be perfect from a personality perspective. Those flaws are also beautiful.

2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:49.840
 So, but yeah, there is something about hard work. And there's also something about the

2:28:49.840 --> 2:28:56.240
 being an underdog and being able to carry a team. That's, that's an argument from Maradona.

2:28:56.240 --> 2:29:01.120
 I don't know if you can make that argument for Messi and Ronaldo either, because they've all

2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:06.000
 played on superstar teams for most of their lives. So I don't know how,

2:29:08.240 --> 2:29:10.480
 you know, it's, it's difficult to know how they would do

2:29:12.640 --> 2:29:18.240
 when they had to work, like did what Maradona had to do to carry a team on the shoulders.

2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:22.880
 True. And Pele did as well. And so, depending on the, the context.

2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:26.720
 Maybe you could argue that with the Portuguese national team, but we have a good team.

2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:33.200
 Yeah. But maybe what Maradona did with, you know, Napples and, and a couple other teams,

2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:34.400
 it's, it seems incredible.

2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:37.680
 It speaks to the beauty of the game that, you know, we're talking about all these different

2:29:37.680 --> 2:29:41.840
 players that have, or especially, you know, if you're comparing Messi and Ronaldo,

2:29:41.840 --> 2:29:47.440
 they have such different, you know, styles of play and also even their bodies are so different.

2:29:47.440 --> 2:29:54.320
 And, and, and, but these two very different players can be at the top of the game. And

2:29:54.320 --> 2:29:59.120
 that's not, that's the, there are not a lot of other sports where you, where you have that,

2:29:59.120 --> 2:30:05.440
 you know, like you have kind of a mental image of a basketball player and like the top basketball

2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:11.600
 players kind of fit that mental image and they look a certain way. And, but for soccer, there's

2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:17.520
 some, there's the, it's, it's not so much like that. And, and that's, I think that's, that's

2:30:17.520 --> 2:30:20.800
 beautiful. But that's, that really adds something to the sport.

2:30:21.440 --> 2:30:25.760
 Well, do you play soccer yourself? Have you played that in your life? What do you find

2:30:25.760 --> 2:30:26.960
 beautiful about the game?

2:30:26.960 --> 2:30:31.600
 Yeah. I mean, it's one of the, I'd say it's the biggest sport in Portugal. And so growing up,

2:30:31.600 --> 2:30:32.720
 we played a lot.

2:30:32.720 --> 2:30:36.240
 Did you see the paper from DeepMind? I didn't look at it where they're like,

2:30:37.040 --> 2:30:40.240
 doing some analysis on soccer strategy.

2:30:40.240 --> 2:30:41.520
 Yeah. Interesting.

2:30:41.520 --> 2:30:47.520
 I saved that paper. I haven't read it yet. It's actually, I, when I was in college,

2:30:47.520 --> 2:30:55.120
 I actually did some research on, on applying machine learning and statistics in sports.

2:30:55.120 --> 2:31:02.640
 And in our case, in our case, we're doing it for basketball. But what they're effectively

2:31:02.640 --> 2:31:07.760
 trying to do was, have you ever watched Moneyball? So they're trying to do something

2:31:07.760 --> 2:31:12.160
 similar, right? Taking that, in this case, basketball, taking a statistical approach

2:31:12.160 --> 2:31:19.280
 to, to basketball. The interesting thing there is that baseball is much more about having these

2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:24.240
 discrete events that happen kind of in similar conditions. And so it's easier to take a statistical

2:31:24.240 --> 2:31:30.000
 approach to it. Whereas basketball, it's a much more dynamic game. It's harder to measure.

2:31:31.760 --> 2:31:37.680
 It's hard to replicate these conditions. And so you have to think about it in a slightly

2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:43.360
 different way. And so we were doing work on that and working like with the Celtics to analyze the,

2:31:43.360 --> 2:31:47.120
 the data that they had, like they had these cameras in the, in the arena, they were tracking

2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:50.800
 the players. And so you, so they have, they had a ton of data, but they didn't really know what to

2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:57.120
 do with it. And so we, we were doing work on that. And, and, and soccer is maybe an even a step

2:31:57.120 --> 2:32:01.920
 further. It's, it's right. It's a game where you don't have as many in basketball, you have a lot

2:32:01.920 --> 2:32:07.600
 of field goals. And so you can measure success. Soccer, it's, it's right. It's more of a Poisson

2:32:07.600 --> 2:32:12.640
 process almost where it's like, you have a goal like or two in a game. In terms of metrics,

2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:16.880
 I wonder if there's a way, and I've actually have thought about this in the past, never coming up

2:32:16.880 --> 2:32:21.120
 with any good solution. If there's a way to definitively say whether it's messy or not,

2:32:21.120 --> 2:32:26.720
 they're the greatest of all time. Like, like honestly, sort of measure, like convert the game

2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:32.000
 of soccer into metrics, like you said, baseball, but like those moments are genius. Like, like,

2:32:33.760 --> 2:32:38.800
 you know, if it's just about goals or passes that led to goals, that feels like it doesn't capture

2:32:38.800 --> 2:32:44.880
 the genius of the play. Yeah, they'll be like, you know, like, like you kind of do, you have

2:32:44.880 --> 2:32:49.840
 more metrics, for instance, in chess, right? And you can try to understand all heart of a move

2:32:50.800 --> 2:32:56.080
 that was, you know, there's like Bobby Fisher as this move that like, that it's, I think it's

2:32:56.080 --> 2:33:01.680
 called the move of the century, where you have to go so deep into the tree to understand that

2:33:01.680 --> 2:33:06.720
 that was the right move, and you can quantify how hard it was. So it'd be interesting to try to think

2:33:06.720 --> 2:33:10.960
 of those type of metrics, but say for soccer and computer vision, unlock some of that for us.

2:33:10.960 --> 2:33:15.840
 That's, that's one possibility. I have a cool idea, a computer vision product legs that you

2:33:15.840 --> 2:33:24.640
 could build for soccer. Like, if you could detect the ball and like imagine that it seems like

2:33:24.640 --> 2:33:29.840
 totally doable right now. But like, if you could detect when the ball enters one of the goals,

2:33:29.840 --> 2:33:35.200
 and like just had like, you know, a crowd cheering for you when you're playing soccer with your

2:33:35.200 --> 2:33:40.160
 friends, every time you score a goal, or you had like the, the Champions League song going on.

2:33:40.160 --> 2:33:44.000
 And like having that, like you go play soccer with your friends, just turn that on. And there's

2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:48.880
 like a computer vision, like program, analyzing the ball every time there's a goal. Like if you

2:33:48.880 --> 2:33:54.480
 miss, like there's a, you know, the fan reacting to that. And then it should be pretty simple by now.

2:33:54.480 --> 2:33:59.280
 It's like, I think there's an opportunity. Yeah, just throwing that. I would go all out. But by the

2:33:59.280 --> 2:34:04.640
 way, I did, I've never released, I was thinking of just putting on GitHub, but I did write exactly

2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:09.600
 that, which is the trackers for the players for the, for the bodies of the player is this is the

2:34:09.600 --> 2:34:16.000
 hard part, actually, the detection of player bodies and the ball is not hard. What's hard is

2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:24.000
 is very like robust tracking through time of each of those. So like, so I've wrote a track of this

2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:29.680
 pretty damn good. Is that open source? You open source? No, I've never released it because interesting

2:34:29.680 --> 2:34:36.880
 because I thought like, I need to, this is the perfection thing because I knew it was going

2:34:36.880 --> 2:34:43.920
 to be like, it's going to pull me in and it wasn't really that done. And so I've never actually been

2:34:43.920 --> 2:34:48.880
 part of a GitHub project where it's like really active development. And I didn't want to make it,

2:34:48.880 --> 2:34:52.960
 I knew there's a non zero probability that will become my life for like a half a year.

2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:58.320
 That's just how much I love soccer and all of those kinds of things. And, and ultimately,

2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:04.000
 it will be all for just the, the joy of analyzing the game, which I'm all for.

2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:07.360
 I remember you also like one of, in one of the episodes you mentioned that you did also a lot

2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:12.240
 of eye tracking analyses on like Joe Rogan's. That was the, that was the research side of my life.

2:35:12.240 --> 2:35:16.480
 Interesting. Yeah. And you have that library, right? You, you kind of downloaded all the episodes.

2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:21.040
 Yep. Allegedly. I, of course I didn't. If you're a lawyer, I'm listening to this.

2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:25.040
 No, it is, I was listening to the episode where you mentioned that. And I was actually,

2:35:25.040 --> 2:35:31.040
 there was something that I might ask you for, for access to that, to allegedly that library.

2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:37.200
 But I was doing some, not, not regarding like eye tracking, but I was playing around with

2:35:37.200 --> 2:35:43.040
 analyzing the distribution of silences on one of the Joe Rogan episodes. So like,

2:35:43.040 --> 2:35:48.480
 I did that for the Elon conversation where it's like, you just take all the silences

2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:54.800
 after Joe asks the question and Elon responded and you plot that distribution and like and see

2:35:54.800 --> 2:35:59.280
 how, how, how, how that looks like. Yeah. I think there's a huge opportunity,

2:35:59.280 --> 2:36:04.480
 especially long form podcast to do that kind of analysis bigger than Joe.

2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:09.600
 Exactly. But it has to be in fairly unedited podcasts so that you don't cut the silences.

2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:13.920
 So one of the benefits I have, like how I'm doing this podcast is like the, what we're

2:36:13.920 --> 2:36:19.680
 recording today is there's individual audio that being recorded. So like I have the raw

2:36:19.680 --> 2:36:24.720
 information. It's, when it's published, it's all combined together and individual video feeds. So

2:36:24.720 --> 2:36:30.240
 even when you're listening, which I usually don't, I only show one video stream, I, I'll know,

2:36:30.240 --> 2:36:37.840
 I can track your blinks and so on. But, but ultimately the hope is you don't need that raw

2:36:37.840 --> 2:36:41.920
 data because if you don't need the raw data for whatever analysis you're doing, you can then

2:36:41.920 --> 2:36:46.480
 do a huge number of podcasts because there's, it's quickly growing now, the number, especially

2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:54.080
 comedians. There's quite a few comedians with, with long form podcasts and they have a lot of

2:36:54.080 --> 2:36:58.160
 facial expressions. They have a lot of fun and all those kinds of things. And it's, it's prone

2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:03.840
 for analysis. And it's, there's so many interesting things. That, that, that idea actually sparked

2:37:03.840 --> 2:37:10.720
 because I was watching a Q and A by, by Steve Jobs and I think it was at MIT. And then like

2:37:10.720 --> 2:37:15.440
 people's like, it did a talk there. And then the Q and A started and people starting asking

2:37:15.440 --> 2:37:20.000
 questions that I was, I was working while listening to it. And like, someone asked the question

2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:24.880
 and he goes like on a 20 second silence before answering the question. I like, I had to check

2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:32.080
 if the, if the video hadn't paused or something. And, and I was thinking about like, if that is a

2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:37.280
 feature of a person, like how long on average you take to respond to a question and if it's like,

2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:42.240
 as to do with the, like how thoughtful you are, and if that changes over time.

2:37:43.040 --> 2:37:46.560
 But it also could be, this is really fascinating metric because it also could be,

2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:50.400
 it's certainly a feature of a person, but it's also a function of the question.

2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:55.680
 True. Like if you normalize to the person, you can probably infer a bunch of stuff about the

2:37:55.680 --> 2:38:00.640
 question. So it's a nice flag. Like it's a really strong signal, the length of that silence,

2:38:01.360 --> 2:38:07.040
 relative to the usual silence they have. So one, the silence is a measure of how thoughtful they are.

2:38:07.040 --> 2:38:11.120
 And two, the particular silence is a measure how thoughtful the question was.

2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:13.680
 Thoughtful the question was. It's really interesting. I mean, yeah.

2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:21.280
 Yeah. I just analyzed Elon's episode, but I think there's like room for exploration there.

2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:26.000
 I feel like the average for comedians would be like, I mean, the time would be so small because

2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:30.400
 you're trained to like, I would think you're reacting to Hickler, to reacting to all sorts

2:38:30.400 --> 2:38:35.840
 of things. You have to be like so quick. Maybe. Yeah. But some of the greatest comedians are very

2:38:35.840 --> 2:38:42.480
 good at sitting in the silence. I mean, there's Lucy Kay, they played with that because you have

2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:52.720
 a rhythm. Like Dave Chappelle, a comedian who did a Joe's show recently, he has a, especially when

2:38:52.720 --> 2:39:01.040
 he's just having a conversation, he does long pauses. It's kind of cool. It's one of the ways

2:39:01.040 --> 2:39:06.960
 to have people hang in your ward is to play with the pauses, to play with the silences

2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:12.560
 and the emphasis and like mid sentence. There's a bunch of different things that, it'd be interesting

2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:20.080
 to really, really analyze, but still soccer to me is that one. I just want a conclusive

2:39:20.080 --> 2:39:27.520
 definitive statement about, because like there are so many soccer highlights of both Messi and

2:39:27.520 --> 2:39:35.920
 Ronaldo. I just feel like the raw data is there. I'm just in the side. Because you don't have

2:39:35.920 --> 2:39:41.680
 that with Pelé and Maradona. Yeah, true. But here's a huge amount of high dev data,

2:39:41.680 --> 2:39:46.880
 then the annoying, the difficult thing. And this is really hard for tracking. And this is actually

2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:55.680
 where I kind of gave up. I didn't really give much effort, but I gave up to the way that highlights

2:39:55.680 --> 2:40:01.600
 or usually football match filmed is they switched the camera. So they'll do a different

2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:06.160
 switch perspective. So you have to, it's a really interesting computer vision problem. When the

2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:11.200
 perspective is switched, you still have a lot of overlap about the players, but the perspective

2:40:11.200 --> 2:40:17.200
 is sufficiently different that you have to like recompute everything. So there's two ways to solve

2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:22.720
 this. One is doing it the full way where you're constantly doing the slam problem. You're doing

2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:28.160
 a 3D reconstruction the whole time and projecting into that 3D world. But you could also, there could

2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:35.360
 be some hacks that I wonder like some trick where you can hop like when the perspective shifts

2:40:36.240 --> 2:40:44.080
 do a high probability tracking hops from one object to another. But I thought especially

2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:52.240
 in exciting moments when you're passing players, like you're doing a single ball dribble across

2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:56.400
 players and you switch perspective, which is when they often do when you're making a run on goal.

2:40:56.400 --> 2:41:01.040
 If you switch a perspective, it feels like that's going to be really tricky to get right

2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:06.880
 automatically. But in that case, for instance, I feel like if somebody released that data set or

2:41:06.880 --> 2:41:13.280
 it's like you just have all like these this data set a massive data set of all these games from

2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:19.040
 from say Ronaldo and Messi like and just you just add that in like whatever CSV format and some

2:41:19.040 --> 2:41:24.640
 some publicly available data set like that. I feel like people just there would be so many

2:41:24.640 --> 2:41:28.720
 cool things that you could do with it and you just set it free and then like the world would

2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:34.080
 like do its thing and then like interesting things would come out of it. By the way, I have this data

2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:41.200
 set. So the two the two things I've did of this scale is soccer. So is body pose and ball tracking

2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:48.720
 for soccer and then I try it's the pupil tracking and blink tracking for it was Joe Rogan and a

2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:53.840
 few other podcasts that I did. So those are the two data sets I have. Did you analyze any of your

2:41:53.840 --> 2:42:03.840
 podcasts? No, I think I really started doing this podcast after after doing that work and it's difficult

2:42:03.840 --> 2:42:13.440
 to maybe I'd be afraid of what I find. I'm already annoyed with my own voice and video like editing

2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:19.120
 it. But perhaps that's the honest thing to do because one useful thing I bought doing computer

2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:25.200
 vision about myself is like I know what I was thinking at the time. So you can start to like

2:42:25.200 --> 2:42:33.120
 connect the particular the behavioral peculiarities of like the way you blink the way you squint

2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:39.760
 the way you close your eyes like talking about details. There's it's like for example, I just

2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:46.320
 closed my eyes. Is that a blink or no? Like figuring that out in terms of timing in terms of the

2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:53.520
 blink dynamics is tricky. It's very doable. I think there's universal laws about what is a

2:42:53.520 --> 2:42:58.160
 blink and what is a closed eye and all those things plus makeup and eyelashes. I actually

2:42:59.680 --> 2:43:05.200
 have annoyingly long eyelashes. So I remember when I was doing a lot of this work, I cut off my

2:43:05.200 --> 2:43:11.040
 eyelashes which when like especially it was funny like female colleagues were like what the

2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:16.480
 fuck are you doing? Like no keep the eyelashes but because it got in the way made the computer vision

2:43:16.480 --> 2:43:23.920
 a lot more difficult. But super interesting topics. Yeah, but speaking about the one still on the

2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:29.680
 topic of the data sets for sports, there's one paper that and I actually annotated it on Fermat

2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:39.120
 and it was published in the 90s. 90s, I believe. 90s or 80s, I forget. But the researcher was

2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:47.200
 effectively looking at the hot and phenomena in basketball. So whether like the fact that you

2:43:47.200 --> 2:43:54.400
 just made a field goal, if on your next attempt, if you're more likely to make it or not.

2:43:56.720 --> 2:44:02.160
 And it was super interesting because I mean he pulled like I think 100 undergrads and I think

2:44:02.160 --> 2:44:07.440
 from Stanford and Cornell and asking people like do you think that you have a higher likelihood of

2:44:07.440 --> 2:44:15.520
 making your free throw if you just made one and I think it's like 68% said yes. They believe that.

2:44:15.520 --> 2:44:22.720
 And then he looked at the data and this was back in as I said like a few decades ago and so I think

2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:28.080
 he had the data set of about, he looked at it specifically for free throws and he had a data

2:44:28.080 --> 2:44:36.640
 set of about 5,000 free throws and effectively what he found was that specifically in the case of

2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:44.800
 free throws, for the aggregate data he didn't find that he couldn't really spot that correlation,

2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:50.960
 that hot and correlation. So if you made the first one, you weren't more likely to make the second

2:44:50.960 --> 2:44:55.760
 one. What he did find was that they were just better at the second one because you just got

2:44:55.760 --> 2:45:00.960
 like maybe a tiny practice and you just attempted once and then you were going to be better at the

2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:08.080
 next one and then I went and there's a data set on Kaggle that has like 600,000 free throws

2:45:08.080 --> 2:45:15.040
 and I re ran the same computations and confirmed like you can see a very clear pattern that they're

2:45:15.040 --> 2:45:20.480
 just better at their second free throw. That's interesting because I think there's similar,

2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:26.000
 that kind of analysis is so awesome because I think with tennis they have like a fault like

2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:30.960
 when you serve they have analysis of like are you most likely to miss the second serve if you

2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:38.240
 missed the first obviously. I think that's the case. So that integrates, that's so cool when

2:45:38.240 --> 2:45:43.680
 psychology is converted into metrics in that way and in sports it's especially cool because it's

2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:48.880
 such a constrained system that you can really study human psychology because it's repeated,

2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:55.200
 it's constrained, so many things are controlled which is something you rarely have in the wild

2:45:55.200 --> 2:46:01.200
 psychological experiments so it's cool. Plus everyone loves it, like sports is really cool to

2:46:01.200 --> 2:46:09.360
 analyze. People actually care about the results. Yeah, I still think, well like I and I will

2:46:09.360 --> 2:46:14.320
 definitely publish this work on Messi versus Ronaldo and I've left to read it. Objective,

2:46:14.320 --> 2:46:21.920
 fully objective. I'd love to peer review. Yeah, this is very true, this is not past peer review.

2:46:21.920 --> 2:46:28.640
 Let me ask sort of an advice question to the young folks.

2:46:29.360 --> 2:46:35.520
 You've explored a lot of fascinating ideas in your life. You built a startup, worked on physics,

2:46:35.520 --> 2:46:40.800
 worked on computer science. What advice would you give to young people today in high school,

2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:46.640
 maybe early college, about life, about career, about science and mathematics?

2:46:46.640 --> 2:46:59.440
 I remember reading that Poincaré was once asked by a French journal about his advice for young

2:46:59.440 --> 2:47:04.960
 people and what was his teaching philosophy and he said that one of the most important things

2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:11.600
 that parents should teach their kids is how to be enthusiastic in regards to the mysteries of the

2:47:11.600 --> 2:47:16.720
 world and that he said like striking that balance was actually one of the most important things

2:47:16.720 --> 2:47:21.680
 between like in education. You want to have your kids be enthusiastic about the mysteries of the

2:47:21.680 --> 2:47:25.520
 world but you also don't want to traumatize them like if you really force them into something

2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:33.600
 and I think like especially if you're young, I think you should be curious and I think you should

2:47:33.600 --> 2:47:41.440
 explore that curiosity to the fullest, to the point where you even become almost as an expert

2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:47.360
 on that topic and you might start with something that it's small like you might start with

2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:52.400
 you're interested in numbers and how to factor numbers into primes and then all of a sudden you

2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:57.920
 go and you're like lost in number theory and you discover cryptography and then all of a

2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:04.160
 sudden you're buying Bitcoin and I think you should do this. You should really try to fulfill

2:48:04.160 --> 2:48:08.960
 this curiosity and you should live in a society that allows you to fulfill this curiosity which

2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:14.960
 is also important and I think you should do this not to get to some sort of status or fame or money

2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:20.160
 but I think this is the way this iterative process, I think this is the way to find happiness

2:48:20.800 --> 2:48:26.960
 and I think this also allows you to find the meaning for your life. I think it's all about

2:48:26.960 --> 2:48:32.560
 like being curious and being able to fulfill that curiosity and that path to fulfilling that

2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:38.640
 your curiosity. Yeah, the start small and let the fire build this kind of interesting way to

2:48:38.640 --> 2:48:44.960
 think about it. And you never know where you're going to end up. For us it's just a really good

2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:51.440
 example. We started by doing this as an internal thing that we did in the company and then we

2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:56.800
 started putting out there and now a lot of people follow it and know about it. And you still don't

2:48:56.800 --> 2:49:02.400
 know where Fermara's library is going to end up actually. True, exactly. So yeah, I think that

2:49:02.400 --> 2:49:08.880
 would be my piece of advice with very limited experience of course but yeah, I agree. I agree.

2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:14.960
 I mean is there something in from particular as you're all from the computer science versus

2:49:14.960 --> 2:49:21.280
 physics perspective? Do you regret not doing physics? Do you regret not doing computer science?

2:49:21.280 --> 2:49:27.760
 Which one is the wiser, the better human being? This is messy versus Ronaldo. Those are very,

2:49:29.040 --> 2:49:32.400
 I don't know if you would agree but they're kind of different disciplines.

2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:43.440
 True, yeah, very much so. Actually, I had that question in my mind. I took physics classes

2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:50.800
 as an undergrad or like besides what I had to take and it's definitely something that I considered

2:49:50.800 --> 2:50:02.880
 at some point. And I do feel like later in life that might be something that I'm not sure if

2:50:02.880 --> 2:50:08.960
 regret is the right word but it's kind of something that I can imagine in an alternative

2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:17.040
 universe what would have happened if I had gone into physics. I try to think that like,

2:50:17.040 --> 2:50:24.080
 well, it depends on what your path ends up being but that it's not super important, right? Like

2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:33.120
 exactly what you decide to major on. I think Tim Urban, the blogger, had a good visualization

2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:39.360
 of this where it's like, he has a picture where you have all sorts of paths that he could pursue

2:50:39.360 --> 2:50:43.440
 in your life and then maybe you're in the middle of it and so there's maybe some paths that are

2:50:43.440 --> 2:50:47.840
 not accessible to you but like the tree that is still in front of you gives you a lot of

2:50:47.840 --> 2:50:53.200
 optionality and so there's still lessons to learn from that. Like we have a huge number of options

2:50:53.200 --> 2:51:02.720
 now and probably you're just one to reflect. Like to try to derive wisdom from the one little

2:51:02.720 --> 2:51:07.040
 path you've taken so far may be flawed because there's all these other paths you could have taken.

2:51:07.040 --> 2:51:12.400
 Yeah. So it's like, so one, it's inspiring that you can take any path now and two,

2:51:13.120 --> 2:51:19.120
 it's like the path you've taken so far is just one of many possible ones but it does seem that like

2:51:20.400 --> 2:51:24.960
 physics and computer science both open a lot of doors and a lot of different doors.

2:51:24.960 --> 2:51:31.600
 True. It's very interesting. It is. In this case and especially in our case because I could see the

2:51:31.600 --> 2:51:38.000
 difference, I studied, I went to college in Europe and João went to college here in the US so I could

2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:43.920
 see the difference and like the European system is more rigid in the sense that when you decide to

2:51:43.920 --> 2:51:47.200
 study physics you don't have a lot, especially in the early years, you don't have a lot of,

2:51:48.400 --> 2:51:52.880
 you can't choose to take like a class from like computer science course or something like that,

2:51:52.880 --> 2:51:57.120
 don't have a lot of freedom to explore in that sense in university as opposed to here in the US

2:51:57.120 --> 2:52:04.240
 where you have more freedom. And I think that's important. I think that's what constitutes a

2:52:04.240 --> 2:52:09.600
 good kind of educational system is one that gravitates towards the interests of a student

2:52:09.600 --> 2:52:14.960
 as you progress. But I think in order for you to do that, you need to explore different areas.

2:52:14.960 --> 2:52:20.000
 And I felt like if I had a chance to take say more computer science class when I was in college,

2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:25.280
 I would have probably have taken those classes but yeah, but I ended up like focusing maybe too

2:52:25.280 --> 2:52:32.960
 too much in physics and I think here at least my perception is that you can explore more fields.

2:52:32.960 --> 2:52:39.920
 But there is a kind of, it's funny, but physics can be difficult. So I don't see too many computer

2:52:39.920 --> 2:52:47.920
 science people then exploring into physics. It's like the one, not the one, but one of the beneficial

2:52:47.920 --> 2:52:57.440
 things of physics, it feels like it, was it Rutherford that said like basically that physics is

2:52:57.440 --> 2:53:02.160
 the hard thing and everything is easy. So like there's a certain sense once you've figured out

2:53:02.160 --> 2:53:07.840
 some basic like physics that it's not that you need the tools of physics to understand the other

2:53:07.840 --> 2:53:13.120
 disciplines, it's that you're empowered by having done difficult shit. I mean, the ultimate I think

2:53:13.120 --> 2:53:20.080
 is probably mathematics there. Yeah, true. So maybe just doing difficult things and proving to

2:53:20.080 --> 2:53:23.840
 yourself that you can do difficult things, whatever those are. That's not positive, I believe.

2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:30.640
 Not positive. Yeah. And I think like before I started a company, I worked in the financial

2:53:30.640 --> 2:53:36.240
 sector for a bit. And like I think having a physics background, I felt I was not afraid of

2:53:36.240 --> 2:53:41.280
 like learning like finance things. And I think like when you come from those backgrounds, you are

2:53:41.280 --> 2:53:45.440
 generally not afraid of stepping into other fields and learning about those because

2:53:46.640 --> 2:53:52.720
 yeah, I feel we've learned a lot of difficult things and yeah, that's an added benefit, I believe.

2:53:54.000 --> 2:54:01.280
 This was an incredible conversation, Luis, Joao. We started with, who do we start with? Feynman

2:54:01.280 --> 2:54:05.920
 ended up with Messi and Ronaldo. So this is like the perfect conversation. It's really an honor

2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:09.920
 that you guys would waste all this time with me today. It was really fun. Thanks for talking.

2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:14.640
 Thank you so much for having us. Yeah, thank you so much. Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:54:14.640 --> 2:54:22.640
 with Luis and Joao Batala. And thank you to Skiff, Simply Safe, Indeed, NetSuite, and ForSigmatic.

2:54:22.640 --> 2:54:27.840
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words

2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:33.280
 from Richard Feynman. Nobody ever figures out what life is all about. And it doesn't matter.

2:54:33.280 --> 2:54:39.120
 Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.

2:54:39.120 --> 2:55:03.120
 Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
