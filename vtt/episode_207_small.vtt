00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
 The following is a conversation with Chris Duffin, the mad scientist of strength.

00:05.440 --> 00:10.880
 He's one of the strongest people in the world, but is also an engineer of some of the most

00:10.880 --> 00:16.480
 innovative strength equipment I've ever seen. Check out his company, Kabuki Strength.

00:16.480 --> 00:21.920
 He is the only person who squatted and deadlifted 1,000 pounds for multiple reps,

00:21.920 --> 00:24.800
 and achieved many other amazing feats of strength.

00:24.800 --> 00:30.400
 He has lived one hell of a life of hardship and triumph, as he writes about in his book

00:30.400 --> 00:36.240
 called The Eagle and the Dragon. Quick mention of our sponsors, Headspace,

00:36.240 --> 00:42.320
 Magic Spoon, Sunbasket, and Ladder. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.960
 As a side note, let me say that I was always a fan of strength,

00:46.960 --> 00:52.480
 both powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting, both as a fan and practitioner.

00:52.480 --> 00:58.480
 Mostly, I'm a fan of people who are willing to put in years of hard work towards finding out what

00:58.480 --> 01:04.480
 the limits of their body is, and then smashing past those limits. People like Chris Duffin,

01:04.480 --> 01:10.720
 or on the Olympic weightlifting side, people like Dmitri Klokov. That guy's great.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.760
 This is why I love watching the Olympics, both the heartbreaks and the triumphs.

01:15.760 --> 01:20.720
 They all reveal the incredible heights that the human mind and the human body can reach.

01:20.720 --> 01:27.040
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Chris Duffin.

01:27.040 --> 01:34.000
 You've been a part of several incredible feats of strength. Which was the hardest,

01:34.000 --> 01:40.320
 or maybe one you're most proud of? Definitely the one I'm most proud of is that journey

01:41.040 --> 01:46.640
 for the grand goals. It was like a five year scope that I chased this. When you think about

01:46.640 --> 01:51.840
 training, it took more than five years, obviously. By that point, I'd been training for over 25 years.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.760
 It makes me proud. There were three distinct things that I wanted to accomplish out of this.

01:57.760 --> 02:07.280
 It was really thought out. This was my exit from being a competitive lifter. Basically saying,

02:07.280 --> 02:13.280
 hey, I'm going to be an Instagram lifter, an exhibition lifter, or whatever. I've done this

02:13.280 --> 02:18.720
 for 16 years. That's number one in the world for eight years straight, all time world records.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.000
 I'm not going to do that anymore. What I want to do is just something deep down to me

02:24.000 --> 02:28.800
 that is really important. There's three things that we're driving this. This is a five year

02:28.800 --> 02:36.160
 journey that I went through to do this. I really wanted to showcase that you could do something

02:36.160 --> 02:39.760
 that is well beyond the scope of what people think is humanly possible.

02:39.760 --> 02:48.160
 So just this inspiration thing, this grand over the top. If you set your mind to a single minded

02:48.160 --> 02:53.760
 goal, you can go so much further. I didn't even say what the goal was up front because it was so

02:53.760 --> 02:59.520
 far out there I would have been laughed at. I think big goals should be kept pretty damn close

02:59.520 --> 03:06.240
 to start with for that reason too. Then the second piece was to walk the walk, to show

03:06.240 --> 03:12.240
 the principles of what I believed in around human movement, the ability to manage and control the

03:12.240 --> 03:17.040
 spinal mechanics and the output that can have on the body. I wanted to take the two most basic

03:17.040 --> 03:22.640
 movements that every able bodied person should be able to do. So fundamental movement patterns,

03:22.640 --> 03:27.680
 the squat, which is like in the developmental approach is around nine months as a baby from

03:27.680 --> 03:33.920
 a developmental kinesiology standpoint and a really basic pattern that every able bodied

03:33.920 --> 03:37.280
 person should be able to master. The other one being the hip hinge, being able to pick

03:37.280 --> 03:44.080
 something up off the ground, a deadlift. And I wanted to do those two, not just one, because

03:44.080 --> 03:52.400
 I wanted to show the principles that I wasn't built for one. I wasn't a specialist because of

03:53.040 --> 04:00.000
 my lever links, torso links, all that, any outliers, because nobody had ever done

04:00.000 --> 04:07.680
 a thousand pound squat. So this is it is and a thousand pound deadlift. It was outside of the

04:07.680 --> 04:12.240
 scope of what anybody's there's like half a dozen people that have done one or the other,

04:12.240 --> 04:16.640
 but nobody's ever done both. And I wanted to do something unique. I wanted to do them,

04:17.200 --> 04:22.720
 not only do it, but do them for reps to leave literally no question out there. And there's no

04:22.720 --> 04:29.760
 competition for that. So it was, this is what I'm going to go do. And to pull it off, I had some

04:29.760 --> 04:33.440
 past issues with my elbows and stuff that I couldn't work around. So I had to wear

04:34.160 --> 04:37.680
 straps, which was another reason I didn't do it in the competition setting.

04:38.880 --> 04:43.120
 So the first year I worked up and I did a thousand and two pound deadlift,

04:43.120 --> 04:46.720
 we plates were weighed afterwards, it was a couple little bit over. And I did it for almost

04:46.720 --> 04:53.680
 three reps. And that still stands as Guinness World Record, just the one rep does, is the

04:53.680 --> 04:58.880
 most weight ever sumo deadlifted. And one other person has deadlifted a thousand for reps at

04:58.880 --> 05:03.680
 this point. And that was Thor Bjornsson from Game of Thrones, he's done a thousand for a double as

05:03.680 --> 05:08.800
 well. So then the next four years, and I did a bunch of feats of strength on the way, but it was

05:08.800 --> 05:14.320
 all about building that axial loading capacity, the strength that because now I'm moving the weight

05:14.320 --> 05:20.240
 from my hands up to my shoulders. And so to do it for reps is like so much harder than a single,

05:20.240 --> 05:27.920
 like five to 10 seconds versus 30 plus seconds to be able to buffer and manage all that with that

05:27.920 --> 05:34.800
 kind of load is just crazy. So it's literally about the duration that your body is carrying the load.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.600
 Yeah, that's a big part of it. Yeah. Because you have to, you're using the resource of the

05:39.600 --> 05:44.800
 diaphragm for stabilization. And so it's also responsible for respiration and all this other

05:44.800 --> 05:48.080
 stuff. So even when you're not squatting, you've got to be handling those loads.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.640
 Just holding that weight is fascinating. It's like, it's fascinating that the human body

05:53.280 --> 06:00.000
 can do that, can, can maintain that structure, just everything working together, that the biology,

06:00.000 --> 06:05.680
 the skeletal structure, the musculature on top of that can hold the weight. It's fascinating to

06:05.680 --> 06:11.200
 watch. Everything is very intentful about positioning and how you're creating pressure and

06:11.200 --> 06:14.800
 all this sort of stuff, especially for me. So when I mentioned that half a dozen people have

06:14.800 --> 06:19.200
 squatted it and half a dozen people have deadlifted it, you understand those people all weigh 380 to

06:19.200 --> 06:26.880
 440 pounds. I weighed 265 to 285 depending on the where I was between the two. So there's that as

06:26.880 --> 06:33.440
 well, right? So big, big difference. And over the course of that, I did a lot of other feats

06:33.440 --> 06:39.360
 of strength that fit in that capacity and we can skip over those. But that was hugely invested as

06:39.360 --> 06:45.680
 far as what I put into being able to accomplish that because it's over the top, which means the

06:45.680 --> 06:51.040
 other stuff had to shift and I had to learn. There's so many things that came into place to

06:51.040 --> 06:56.880
 pull that off. And so yeah, last March, two days before the world shut down, I did it. It was supposed

06:56.880 --> 07:03.120
 to be at the largest equipment exhibition in the world down in San Diego as an event. And that

07:03.120 --> 07:07.520
 got shut down a week beforehand, obviously. So we moved to let's do it in my gym and invite people.

07:08.080 --> 07:13.040
 And that was on a Saturday and Thursday or Friday, they limited it to 25 people for gatherings.

07:13.040 --> 07:20.000
 I did it on Saturday. And then Monday, everything shut down. So it was kind of surreal for timing

07:20.000 --> 07:26.080
 wise, right? And so if I hadn't done it, it wouldn't never got done. Because I'd pushed to the limit.

07:26.080 --> 07:31.440
 I couldn't come back and do it. It was at the total limitation of my capabilities. So I'm pretty

07:31.440 --> 07:38.080
 proud of it. And the last piece was every one of these feats along the way, I collaborated with a

07:38.080 --> 07:43.600
 charity that I believed in. And there was a lot of those tied to my life story, which we probably

07:43.600 --> 07:50.720
 will get into. So it was threefold. So that inspiration piece, inspiration, motivation,

07:50.720 --> 07:57.600
 walk in the walk and showing like, just these methodologies that a guy that had to learn to

07:57.600 --> 08:04.720
 walk again can do something like this with no back pain. There is a way. And the third one is

08:04.720 --> 08:11.680
 to provide awareness and recognition around a lot of key charities. So your heart was in this

08:11.680 --> 08:16.560
 journey, but also your mind is just you're like a scholar of strength, a scientist of strength,

08:16.560 --> 08:24.480
 an engineer of strength. For reps, do 1000 pounds of squat and deadlift. Let's first talk through

08:24.480 --> 08:31.920
 the actual day you did it. What does it take to lift that much for reps?

08:32.480 --> 08:43.360
 The day of is really easy. The lift itself, other than a few seconds, is really easy and not

08:43.360 --> 08:47.600
 challenging. People always ask me, what was it like? How beat up were you after that and the

08:47.600 --> 08:57.200
 deadlift? And the simple fact is, it was easy. The work to get there was horrendous. So even

08:57.200 --> 09:02.720
 the psychology of the day, there was not a fear. There was not a nervousness. There was not a doubt

09:02.720 --> 09:08.640
 in your mind. There was certainly doubts on that day from some training history. So there was some

09:08.640 --> 09:16.400
 major breaks to my confidence in the couple months leading up where I had issues with passing out

09:16.400 --> 09:21.680
 under the bar. So completely losing consciousness. And this was on weight less than 1000 pounds even.

09:22.480 --> 09:30.720
 So that was all this build up in me going, what if? What if I think I have this resolved?

09:31.440 --> 09:36.480
 But what if I get up there and I can't even do a rep? How embarrassing will this be that I've

09:36.480 --> 09:43.680
 been talking about this and planning for this for so long? But outside of that, I knew I could do it.

09:43.680 --> 09:51.040
 In fact, I wanted to do even more even up to the second rep. Training is about working into a

09:51.040 --> 09:59.120
 fatigue state. So you're building an amount of fatigue in your system. And then when you let off

09:59.120 --> 10:02.400
 of it, that's when you get a compensation. And that's how you stair step training. This is

10:02.400 --> 10:07.360
 periodization. But leading into a big event, you're accumulating this massive amount of fatigue.

10:07.360 --> 10:13.600
 And so I was performing at a level that I could do it. And so I knew I was going to be able to

10:13.600 --> 10:19.520
 on meat because then you give yourself that window to be able to recover and supercompensate

10:19.520 --> 10:24.160
 and be able to do a little bit more. So like that first rep when I did it, strengthwise,

10:24.160 --> 10:29.360
 I went, I could do this for five reps. It went through my head. I'm like, I mean, it was easy

10:29.360 --> 10:35.200
 and it was fast. And it felt like amazing. And I'm like, I'm going to crush this. And then set

10:35.200 --> 10:41.360
 rep to the realization kicked in is like, Oh, this is for reps with 1000 pounds on your back.

10:41.360 --> 10:48.080
 And you're fatiguing just like, and then the third one was every last thing I could muster to just

10:48.080 --> 10:53.600
 finish. I mean, I just barely got it done because it's the strength is like there, but like that

10:53.600 --> 10:59.360
 capacity to be able to manage all those resources for that amount of time. Because not just leg

10:59.360 --> 11:05.520
 strength when we're talking about this stuff. So what does it take to go from the, from, I don't

11:05.520 --> 11:12.800
 know what, no, like from 500 to 1000. That feels like a journey that's like exponential. It's

11:12.800 --> 11:18.960
 it gets exponentially harder. It does. In the early 2000s, like I said, I started lifting 1988.

11:19.680 --> 11:27.440
 But my first meet in the early 2000s, my, my max deadlift was 523 and my first squat was 550.

11:27.440 --> 11:35.040
 So breath the heck of a journey. That is a journey for people that are like to lift,

11:35.040 --> 11:38.800
 what should they understand about the difference between doing 500 and 1000

11:39.920 --> 11:44.240
 in terms of the actual lift that you were experiencing that day in terms of the mechanics,

11:44.240 --> 11:48.240
 in terms of all the things you have to be like the neurological adaptation you mentioned,

11:48.960 --> 11:55.440
 the breathing, the core strength, what like techniques, like little tricks, psychological

11:55.440 --> 12:02.160
 tricks, anything that kind of stands out to you. The level of intent and the opportunity for error

12:02.160 --> 12:09.760
 are at a different level. So just the minutest changes of position by quarter inch, half inch

12:09.760 --> 12:17.280
 can be make or break at that level. So these things, everything gets amplified. So the ability to

12:17.280 --> 12:22.400
 start with having the pelvis just in the right orientation to the diaphragm before we start

12:22.400 --> 12:28.720
 initiating what we call the, the eccentric loading of the abdominal cavity to create this

12:28.720 --> 12:34.160
 intra abdominal pressure of working against this outward expansion, working against the outer sheath

12:34.160 --> 12:41.520
 of abdominal thoracolumbar musculature obliques, causing the co contraction at the pelvic floor,

12:41.520 --> 12:45.040
 all this stuff and how you cue that because you can't think about all this stuff. You need to

12:45.040 --> 12:51.120
 break it down and distill and practice to like it's one simple cue that we now lock down and

12:51.120 --> 12:57.280
 control this torso stability because this is what these fundamental movements are about is being able

12:57.280 --> 13:04.560
 to control our spinal mechanics and then now be able to maintain that while articulating the joints

13:04.560 --> 13:12.560
 around that through a range of motion and then using the main power drivers. So in this instance,

13:12.560 --> 13:18.960
 both instances, it's the, you know, the hip complex to generate that power and transfer it from how

13:18.960 --> 13:23.840
 we're rooted and connected to the floor through to the distal end, you know, which would be the

13:23.840 --> 13:29.040
 barbell on the shoulder. You know, there's a couple key concepts. So one is that what we just

13:29.040 --> 13:34.720
 talked through is how to actually maintain that stability. So if you have either the diaphragm,

13:34.720 --> 13:39.840
 so, which is connected at the rib cage, so out of alignment in any position, it needs to be

13:40.800 --> 13:45.920
 in alignment with the pelvic, the pelvis. So those two in opposition. So this is simple

13:45.920 --> 13:51.120
 engineering here. Because what we're going to do is eccentrically load this, we're going to use the

13:51.120 --> 13:56.720
 diaphragm just like you would in a diaphragm pump, where it's going to press down on all the tissue

13:56.720 --> 14:01.200
 in there. So we're not using breath. So our breath was actually a lot of times a default pattern

14:01.200 --> 14:06.880
 when people do that because they'll bring it into their chest and raise their rib cage. So

14:07.840 --> 14:13.120
 what we want to do is just initiate the diaphragm air can be used as well over the top at the final

14:13.120 --> 14:19.840
 to create just a little bit more downward pressure. But if we have out of alignment there, we have a

14:19.840 --> 14:24.800
 pressure leak where it's going to be pushed out the front or the rear if you're either inflection

14:24.800 --> 14:30.320
 or extension. All right. And then that causes this co contraction and all this pressure of

14:31.760 --> 14:35.920
 the organs essentially against outward against all those tissue for the co contraction,

14:35.920 --> 14:40.640
 as well as surrounding the spine to be able to stabilize that. And then it puts all the muscles

14:40.640 --> 14:47.840
 on both sides of the body in what we call the best length tension relationship. So if you think

14:47.840 --> 14:53.440
 about a curl and we reach our arm out at the extended length, our bicep is not as strong.

14:53.440 --> 14:57.360
 And then all the way in the curl position, it's not in strong. There's somewhere in here that's

14:57.360 --> 15:04.080
 this control of both. And so when you're sitting there arched or bent over, we have muscles that

15:04.080 --> 15:08.400
 are past either one of those ranges. So they've got a lot of tension, which then will create

15:08.400 --> 15:12.160
 relaxation on the other side, right? So we want to have an all of that needs to be working.

15:12.720 --> 15:19.680
 And now the next important thing is the foot. So it's actually this connection to the ground

15:19.680 --> 15:26.240
 and how we're actually using the foot and ankle complex to grab and grip this connection to the

15:26.240 --> 15:33.040
 ground and elicit an effect. And because of this and then the everything between will naturally

15:33.040 --> 15:39.280
 kind of do what it needs to do. So people like to focus on knee, knee position or how far out

15:39.280 --> 15:45.840
 their hips are or all this other stuff, which is outputs of this. So if we control the torso and the

15:45.840 --> 15:52.960
 knee, the only thing that can happen from that point is for the squat to happen. All right.

15:53.840 --> 16:00.240
 So this allows us to use this massive foot, you know, the hip complex for all the muscles around

16:00.240 --> 16:05.920
 that that are built to drive through hip extension to complete the squat. I did actually miss one

16:05.920 --> 16:11.840
 thing in there. So this torso, people often miss the lat is a spinal stabilizer as well. So that's

16:11.840 --> 16:19.280
 key in controlling function at the the TL junction, which is just above the lumbar spine. So kind of

16:19.280 --> 16:22.960
 right opposite where your sternum is, and you'll see people kind of roll over sometimes like in

16:22.960 --> 16:27.360
 an Olympic squad or something like that where they lose position. And that's often because

16:27.360 --> 16:30.720
 they're close grip because you can engage the lats very well that way and they're pushing up in the

16:30.720 --> 16:35.600
 bar. But you want to be able to drive and pull the bar to your center and that's going to create

16:35.600 --> 16:41.760
 and use the lats now to drive and connect the shoulder into this. We're kind of compressing

16:41.760 --> 16:46.400
 and tightening all this stuff towards that center to create that entire torso stability. That's why

16:46.400 --> 16:51.760
 I was using torso stability, not just core stability in my conversation earlier.

16:51.760 --> 16:58.640
 Torso stability. Okay, so there's all these like modules of the body then connected to the grounding

16:59.200 --> 17:05.600
 with like your feet on the ground. Everything you're speaking to, how do you work each of those

17:05.600 --> 17:11.600
 modules? Is this over time you kind of develop the feel that ultimately boils onto this one simple

17:11.600 --> 17:17.680
 cue that you mentioned? Or do you can you like literally study each particular module in yourself

17:17.680 --> 17:23.120
 and see how it affects the lift? So the best way and I believe it's because I hate just like people

17:23.120 --> 17:29.120
 getting out and just doing just movement stuff and not actually adding load because we only adapt

17:29.120 --> 17:33.760
 when there's load. Maybe we can get some, you know, some proprioception or awareness of position

17:33.760 --> 17:40.960
 and other stuff doing some, some corrective patterns and other stuff. But this is basic physiology

17:41.600 --> 17:46.640
 is that there must be an imposed demand for us to have adaptation. And this is mental,

17:46.640 --> 17:54.720
 this is emotional, this is all these areas. But and people miss that. So I prefer to be able to

17:55.600 --> 18:01.040
 look at a person and this is our methodology and do the assessment in any basic loaded movement.

18:01.040 --> 18:05.680
 So with developing an eye for that, you can actually see and go, okay, we've got a fault

18:05.680 --> 18:10.400
 pattern right here in the foot and use a cue or a set of cues doesn't really matter till we find

18:10.400 --> 18:14.400
 the one that works and bring that. And now we know we want to simplify this stuff. I just

18:14.400 --> 18:18.400
 walk through that sounds really complicated. And it is if we try to break down and distill it all,

18:18.400 --> 18:22.480
 but like, let's just find the basic stuff that gets us in the range, start working,

18:22.480 --> 18:27.920
 and then find the next as we add load. Now we find where's our next area that we're starting to fault

18:27.920 --> 18:32.240
 that and then go there again next. So this is what we do what we teach in our educational

18:32.240 --> 18:38.960
 platform. So we are the only I believe everybody wants to do a lot of these like assessments,

18:38.960 --> 18:43.440
 you know, on a bench on a table body. And it's like, no, let's let's go squat, let's go deadlift.

18:43.440 --> 18:47.440
 If you do strongman in a CEO carry, let's go carry, because these are basic human fundamentals.

18:47.440 --> 18:53.360
 It's not powerlifting. Like this is how we function. This is why we, we work with 29 of

18:53.360 --> 18:59.360
 the 30 major league baseball teams and 90% of all professional sports out there in North America.

18:59.360 --> 19:04.080
 Sorry, although we do some work with Tour de France and other stuff as well. And North America,

19:04.080 --> 19:10.880
 I do mean hockey too. But these principles like, you know, if if the Dodgers won't bring us in,

19:10.880 --> 19:16.640
 they're not learning how to powerlift, you know, we're gonna, obviously we'll probably be do,

19:16.640 --> 19:22.000
 we do a little bit more shoulder focus than hip focus with their athletes or their coaches.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.440
 We're usually working with coaches, not the athletes. And so you help them and then the

19:25.440 --> 19:30.560
 same thing on yourself to understand the role that these different muscle groups have on the

19:31.200 --> 19:35.360
 holistic. Yeah. So it's all about getting the joints in the appropriate position

19:35.920 --> 19:40.640
 so that we can, that we can manage load so that we're not putting undue stress in the joint,

19:40.640 --> 19:44.080
 we're getting the proper link tension, we're getting these basic fundamental things with the

19:44.080 --> 19:50.560
 body. And so the, the largest global impact that you will have is through spinal mechanics.

19:50.560 --> 19:55.600
 I can't look at a shoulder if I'm not managing this because it's your spine. So for those that

19:55.600 --> 20:01.280
 are just listening like I'm arching and then, and then flexing, that's going to affect shoulder

20:01.280 --> 20:05.520
 extension, flexion, all these sorts of things. So it could even affect things down on what's

20:05.520 --> 20:10.000
 looking at dorsiflexion issues on the foot, like, and then that's why I go to the foot next because

20:10.000 --> 20:14.800
 it has the second largest global impact. And then from there, now I'm going to look at the big energy

20:14.800 --> 20:19.760
 drivers, which is the hip complex, shoulder complex. And then we can start looking at kind of the

20:19.760 --> 20:24.880
 peripheral things, but usually that's some sort of output of the other, but the knees, the elbows,

20:24.880 --> 20:29.360
 the things like that. So it's all about getting the stack, which affects neurology.

20:30.400 --> 20:35.840
 So let's talk of engineering terms. You get in a car, modern car today, and a lot of them will have

20:35.840 --> 20:42.320
 this traction control button in there. And there's a big misconception that I'm out and it's snowy or

20:42.320 --> 20:46.160
 here in Austin only rainy, well, it probably doesn't rain much, but you're going around a corner,

20:46.160 --> 20:49.040
 start slipping, it's like, oh, it's going to send the powers from the wheels that are slipping to

20:49.040 --> 20:54.720
 the ones that are gripping and keep me from crashing and dying a fiery death. Well, that's

20:54.720 --> 21:01.440
 not how it works. It's the exact same. We've got the tires, which are our foot, the connection

21:01.440 --> 21:07.840
 to the ground, right? We've got the power driver, which is, you know, the engine, the transmission

21:07.840 --> 21:13.360
 delivering, you know, the power through it. And we've got the stability or suspension. And then

21:14.240 --> 21:20.800
 we have the neurology. And what the neurology is doing, it's sensing that we don't have good

21:20.800 --> 21:26.800
 stability or loss of connection somewhere. And so I need to save you from crashing and hurting

21:26.800 --> 21:32.320
 yourself. And so it goes to the engine and says, let's retard the timing, let's reduce the shift

21:32.320 --> 21:37.360
 patterns, and we're just reducing the power output. And that's straight how the human body works.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.880
 So when I do this stuff, it's actually affecting that. I mean, I can take somebody and do some

21:42.880 --> 21:49.360
 minute changes with the neck position at the thoracic outlet, okay, and immediately see an

21:49.360 --> 21:55.280
 enhancement in power output. And I can measure it, we measure this stuff with velocity devices.

21:55.280 --> 22:00.720
 And see like a 10%, boom, jump. And so if you think about that, what about all your training

22:00.720 --> 22:07.600
 through the years, where you actually had additional capacity, but you weren't using it because

22:07.600 --> 22:12.000
 your traction control was on. Now you figure this out stuff. And now you start stacking it,

22:12.000 --> 22:20.080
 now you can see so much greater. So it's not just injury prevention. This is performance and additive

22:20.080 --> 22:26.960
 performance over time. This is huge. And people don't really think about this stuff. But we can

22:26.960 --> 22:31.600
 turn that stuff off, which is actually going to also, again, make us make us safer. But what we

22:31.600 --> 22:37.360
 want to do is the performance tune race car, do they have a traction control button? No, they got

22:37.360 --> 22:42.240
 some amazing tires to grip the ground performance tune suspension. And that driver is going to put

22:42.240 --> 22:48.720
 what his foot to the metal, he's going to put it to the floor. Okay, that's a performance vehicle.

22:48.720 --> 22:53.120
 That's what we want to be. I want to continue on the line. But first I have to ask,

22:54.000 --> 22:57.440
 how did it feel to accomplish the grand goal? Oh my God. Okay, when you just

22:58.480 --> 23:06.400
 stand back 1000 pounds for reps, what do you feel like? Anybody can go watch the video online.

23:07.920 --> 23:14.800
 12 film, by the way, got me all excited. Oh, well, the movies. So we actually have the final

23:14.800 --> 23:19.680
 footage of that, the good footage not posted yet. So it's literally just an Instagram video or a

23:19.680 --> 23:23.760
 phone video right now. They're the only one online. Yeah, it's on your YouTube channel,

23:23.760 --> 23:28.400
 but it's dramatic. Yes, it is. Yeah, came out just time to the music perfectly too, which is,

23:28.400 --> 23:32.560
 I listened to some odd music, which there's some reason behind that. But

23:33.440 --> 23:36.960
 I liked it though. It was great. You're saying there's full length footage.

23:37.520 --> 23:42.160
 There's a documentary that's it's got a little slowed because of COVID because it's also a

23:42.160 --> 23:48.080
 backstory of the eagle and the dragon in my book about why I do kind of the things that I've done

23:48.080 --> 23:52.080
 in my life. Or that's what I'm assuming the director is working on. I don't really have

23:52.080 --> 23:59.760
 the control of the movie, right? But okay, the video is okay. How did it feel? How did it feel?

23:59.760 --> 24:07.680
 I started crying. It was overwhelming to have worked so intensely and so long and hard at

24:07.680 --> 24:16.400
 something that pushed every ounce of me to the limit. And I did it. I'm getting a little emotional.

24:16.400 --> 24:24.160
 I did exactly what I said I was going to fucking do. And it was overpowering. I mean,

24:24.160 --> 24:33.360
 I was just crying uncontrollably just with a mixture of I don't know what the mixture of

24:33.360 --> 24:41.200
 emotions is hard to explain. Because it was the completion of something. It was a new phase of

24:41.200 --> 24:46.960
 middle eight. I mean, there's so many things here. So one, you set an impossible goal and you

24:46.960 --> 24:53.680
 accomplished it. One, two is like on the broader humanity aspect, like how many humans in this

24:53.680 --> 25:01.760
 world accomplish perfection in a particular direction required to do this. So like you're

25:01.760 --> 25:10.640
 basically representing one little glimmer of excellence of the human spirit.

25:10.640 --> 25:18.000
 There's always more to understand this. This is a basic fundamental. You can always do better.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.560
 There is no such thing as perfection. There is always more. So anytime you reach something,

25:24.560 --> 25:29.600
 any amazing workout or accomplishment in life, could you have put more into it? Could you?

25:29.600 --> 25:39.520
 Yes. But here's the thing. I left on my terms. I said, this is it. I'm going to work towards.

25:39.520 --> 25:45.040
 I've been training for 30 years. I'm going to do this thing that is like I couldn't even say that

25:45.040 --> 25:52.560
 I was going to do it years before. I'm going to do it. And then I'm done. I didn't leave from an

25:52.560 --> 26:03.280
 injury. I left on, I did exactly what I said. I went to a level that I left on my terms. And

26:03.280 --> 26:09.360
 that's unique. Because that's usually not the case. Usually you kind of either taper out or

26:09.360 --> 26:15.520
 it doesn't matter. I'm talking like anything in life in general, right? You taper out, you fail,

26:15.520 --> 26:24.160
 you hurt, you lose. You roll into retirement. You accomplish something truly great and you

26:24.160 --> 26:31.360
 walked away in your own terms. Is there a sadness completing something like that? Because it's

26:32.400 --> 26:39.760
 in one perspective, the greatest thing you'll ever do. And when you accomplish such a great height,

26:39.760 --> 26:46.480
 in some sense, you have to face your mortality at that point. So good question. But it is certainly

26:46.480 --> 26:51.200
 not the greatest thing that I'll ever do. The greatest physical strength I'll ever do. The

26:51.200 --> 26:59.760
 greatest physical strength. Yes. But that was an expression of some of my values and the way that

26:59.760 --> 27:05.440
 I want to live. It was a way of expressing it. So understanding that is hugely fundamental.

27:05.440 --> 27:13.760
 Because we do see so many athletes get to the end of a career and then they fall into

27:14.560 --> 27:20.880
 a depressive state and struggle with drugs, alcohol, depression, and so on. Because they

27:20.880 --> 27:26.080
 lost how they identified themselves and trying to figure out where to turn what to do. But a big

27:26.080 --> 27:35.760
 central component of their identity is lost. So I knew that this was one way to express that and my

27:35.760 --> 27:42.080
 grand goals have shifted. They're shifted to other outlets that allow me to express that. Like my

27:42.080 --> 27:49.040
 companies, Kabuki Strength, I'm going to change the face of fitness as well as all the way through

27:49.040 --> 27:54.320
 with its integration with clinical medicine and telemedicine. And I got another five years before

27:54.320 --> 27:58.000
 even people see what I'm working on five years in right now because I had to invent equipment.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.240
 I have to develop methodologies that we're talking. I had to do this stuff that ground layer

28:02.240 --> 28:08.480
 wasn't done to create a cohesive ecosystem of training methodology tied to the tools that we're

28:08.480 --> 28:13.840
 using to the environment tied to the clinical practice assessment tied to the interaction

28:13.840 --> 28:18.560
 between all those and how that actually needs to be reframed because so much of this is broken.

28:18.560 --> 28:29.760
 Okay. So, but there is sadness. I won't deny that. And the sadness comes in the singularity

28:31.200 --> 28:39.360
 of focus that I had at that time, the being in the process. Not necessarily do it, but having

28:39.360 --> 28:44.640
 being in this place that the rest of the world kind of fell away from me in those final faces to

28:44.640 --> 28:51.520
 have something so intense, to have a team around me so focused on supporting. And it took me a

28:51.520 --> 28:58.720
 couple months after that squad, I finally one day I woke up and I was like, oh, welcome back to the

28:58.720 --> 29:07.440
 world. I was in such a mental fog. It took me a while to climb out of that, but that space,

29:07.440 --> 29:16.240
 that level of intensity and drive and living and being in that space, I do miss that. But I also,

29:16.240 --> 29:21.040
 I can't continue that. I couldn't continue. Like, there's a point of like, you push it so hard.

29:22.320 --> 29:26.240
 The level to try to go from there is not acceptable for what you, the impacts that

29:26.240 --> 29:29.920
 will have on your life or how you want to live. And it was taking away those final, like,

29:30.640 --> 29:34.720
 I had to do extreme things and live in an extreme way to get there.

29:34.720 --> 29:40.160
 You're just a genius in this whole space of strength and health and body, almost like biology,

29:41.280 --> 29:46.800
 that this strength feat is just one representation of that. But this particular strength feat

29:46.800 --> 29:53.040
 required that kind of singular focus, which I think, I don't know, there's something beautiful

29:53.040 --> 29:59.680
 about that singular focus that is often only truly perfect in athletics. I see it with the

29:59.680 --> 30:04.880
 greatest Olympic athletes as well. The kind of singular focus required there is incredible. It's

30:04.880 --> 30:09.520
 somehow some of the most beautiful things that humans can do.

30:09.520 --> 30:13.280
 And it's not just that thing. So that's the thing. It's like, oh, that must be,

30:13.280 --> 30:19.280
 when we say singular to focus, it's not like, here's it, because it covers a vast array of stuff.

30:20.160 --> 30:26.080
 I was working with people, you know, all, well, yeah, all around North America. I wouldn't say

30:26.080 --> 30:30.720
 anybody around the globe, but professionals coming in working on different aspects of rehab and

30:31.760 --> 30:39.520
 recovery. And like, I mean, I'm tapping all sorts of stuff in so many platforms, from nutrition

30:39.520 --> 30:47.360
 to drugs to, again, like, you know, various Chinese medicine, you know, as far as, you know.

30:47.360 --> 30:53.120
 But also the humans in your life just love and positivity and just inspiration, all those kinds

30:53.120 --> 30:58.640
 of aspects. I mean, you probably would have done much more if you went outside North America and

30:58.640 --> 31:05.760
 talked to some Russians, just between you and I. Possibly. They give you some, I don't know,

31:05.760 --> 31:11.520
 those, there's some incredible strength athletes in Eastern Europe. Absolutely. I've got the best

31:11.520 --> 31:17.600
 one coming in September to get fixed. So what do you mean by fixed? So I'm not sure what his

31:17.600 --> 31:23.360
 particular issues are, but he has held the all time world record repeatedly for a long time,

31:23.360 --> 31:27.920
 and he hasn't competed for some time, and he just reached out saying he would like to come and have

31:27.920 --> 31:32.960
 me take a look and see if I can get him fixed because he needs to return. Okay. So it's more

31:32.960 --> 31:38.560
 injury centric versus like form and fundamental centric combination of everything.

31:38.560 --> 31:42.080
 Everybody always wants to focus on the output. How do you, how do you give me the fix for that?

31:42.080 --> 31:48.080
 But it ties right back into all those other things, right? So, but yeah, the Eastern,

31:48.080 --> 31:53.600
 the Eastern Bloc continued to be a dominant force in regards to athletics and strength

31:53.600 --> 32:00.160
 athletics without a doubt. Some of my big rivals in my competitive days were, that's who it was.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.640
 Rivalry brings out the best in us. Can you tell me the story of your childhood?

32:05.280 --> 32:10.160
 It's definitely outside the scope of the norm. Well, today, maybe not 150 or 200 years ago,

32:10.160 --> 32:17.360
 but my parents, highly intelligent people coming out of the Bay Area,

32:18.720 --> 32:24.560
 my mom was going to school to be a chemical engineer. She was a top student athlete,

32:24.560 --> 32:29.760
 graduating out of her school. My father was a member of Mensa. My stepfather was just a genius,

32:29.760 --> 32:34.880
 but not able to really function in society. But my mom was, she had some demons and some other

32:34.880 --> 32:41.040
 stuff and just, she just said one day, she's like, I just don't want to be part of society. She still

32:41.040 --> 32:50.000
 isn't, lives out in the desert, but has her minds, but she wanted to figure out a way to make a life

32:50.000 --> 32:56.320
 outside of that. And so that's where we ended up is up in the mountains in Northern California.

32:56.320 --> 33:04.800
 And a lot of that was, you know, them trying to get into successfully growing marijuana, which

33:04.800 --> 33:09.600
 back in that, you know, wasn't legal back then, highly illegal. And in fact, those areas were,

33:09.600 --> 33:14.000
 some of the areas where it lived were quite dangerous. So there's a documentary murder

33:14.000 --> 33:20.720
 mountain that came out recently. If you watch that, you'll tie into my book, just the understanding

33:20.720 --> 33:27.200
 of the stuff that I was talking about dealing with serial killers, human trafficking, police

33:27.200 --> 33:35.040
 corruption, murderers, like just how real that stuff is if it doesn't capture you from the book.

33:35.040 --> 33:40.480
 Okay. The book, by the way, is the Eagle and the Dragon. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, yeah. I'm a

33:40.480 --> 33:46.800
 terrible salesperson, like I told you. But a good, it's a good title. I don't know if you came up with

33:46.800 --> 33:52.880
 it, but I did. Yeah. So yeah, we'll talk about that anyway. We're living by a stream, you know,

33:52.880 --> 33:58.320
 off a meadow. There's no roads into where you have to hike in. And we've got beams lashed into the

33:58.320 --> 34:02.080
 trees up above us, because that's where our bedding is, because there's rattlesnake dens

34:02.080 --> 34:10.400
 all around. And six years old, I'm being taught how to capture and handle live rattlesnakes,

34:10.400 --> 34:15.360
 because that's what I need to do to be safe. And you can imagine six years old sitting there with

34:15.360 --> 34:19.040
 a live rattlesnake in your hand grabbing it, you know, by the side of the head, controlling so it

34:19.040 --> 34:24.480
 can't bite you. And it's just wrapping itself around your arm. And you're staring like, it's

34:24.480 --> 34:32.480
 only intent is right then is to kill you. Like that's it, right? You want to take a bath. It's

34:32.480 --> 34:37.280
 filling up the jug in the stream and setting it out on the rocks during the sun. So you dump it

34:37.280 --> 34:42.400
 over your head. And you know, not all the living was that way. You know, good part was similar

34:42.400 --> 34:48.960
 to that tent living, living in a 16 foot trailer with a family of six, which is not much bigger

34:48.960 --> 34:54.240
 than the space that we're sitting here. So we're talking hard winters with feet of snow on the

34:54.240 --> 35:00.880
 ground nowhere to go. I'm living in the back of the pickup truck and just a standard sleeping bag

35:00.880 --> 35:07.040
 that we get from the Salvation Army, not the not the blow zero. So I'm, I'm not sleeping well.

35:07.040 --> 35:13.920
 There's living in homes that were maybe condemned. There's no, no doors even on them. No electricity

35:13.920 --> 35:17.920
 or running water or one or the other both and sometimes a little bit better by the time we

35:17.920 --> 35:24.080
 got to high school, we had a mobile home. So my stepfather had won a disability payment because

35:24.080 --> 35:30.800
 he had a broken arm that whole time from accidents a long time ago and finally got an award and got

35:30.800 --> 35:35.360
 a down payment on this mobile home that didn't have again doors on the inside. It did have

35:35.360 --> 35:39.840
 running water. It did have electricity. It didn't have a kitchen. You know, the windows would crank

35:39.840 --> 35:44.960
 clothes and open, but they wouldn't close all the way. So the trim them in with a plastic to be able

35:44.960 --> 35:50.800
 to try to protect from the elements. That was my environment, like learning how to forge for

35:50.800 --> 35:55.280
 mushrooms. I mean, there were summers I would send and my parents would be out. They were in the drug

35:55.280 --> 36:04.960
 trade earlier. We got taken by the, by the police and put into foster care for, for a while, which

36:04.960 --> 36:08.800
 ties into some of the stories with human trafficking. And honestly, it's in my book,

36:08.800 --> 36:16.480
 but it's really hard for me to talk about that stuff. And obviously not all that's in the book.

36:17.600 --> 36:23.840
 But they got us back, moved to Oregon, and they stayed out of the drug trade from that time to

36:23.840 --> 36:28.880
 ensure that they didn't lose us again, but quickly we kind of fell back into the same thing. So at

36:28.880 --> 36:36.560
 that point it was learning about geology and starting to do mining and firewood cutting,

36:36.560 --> 36:39.680
 but mostly the mining because Pat's broken arm chainsaw made a little tough.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.720
 If you remember just the sequence of moments,

36:43.440 --> 36:48.720
 do you, are you haunted by the, the darker moments of your childhood? Do you remember

36:50.560 --> 36:52.800
 moments of simple joy and happiness?

36:52.800 --> 36:59.120
 Outside of the living around dangerous people and the interactions that came from that,

37:00.000 --> 37:05.360
 we were a family. Like we were a cohesive unit battling against the world together. We spent

37:06.240 --> 37:13.120
 all our time together, work, play. I was there. I was helping raise my, my siblings or I was

37:13.120 --> 37:19.120
 working with them and, you know, it was a constant. Like I said, we were very physically active. So,

37:19.120 --> 37:23.440
 you know, I had that in my upbringing. Pat plugged for my shoe company, Barefoot,

37:25.200 --> 37:28.480
 I ran around the wilderness and bare feet all the time, you know, but it was,

37:29.440 --> 37:36.320
 I had a lot of great moments and I'm thankful for a lot of that childhood once we take out the trauma,

37:36.320 --> 37:42.960
 the other stuff associated with it, right? And so the connection that I have with my sisters

37:42.960 --> 37:49.440
 is, is, is huge. That goes a bit further to, because I am kind of like a little bit of a

37:49.440 --> 37:53.520
 father figure because I was at home raising them and then later I took custody of them

37:54.240 --> 37:57.760
 while I was going to school because the environment at home deteriorated further.

37:57.760 --> 38:04.640
 Their stepfather, like I said, was, he wasn't capable of managing life and my mom had a mental

38:04.640 --> 38:11.120
 breakdown and took off to Montana and he descended into madness even worse. Actually took my,

38:11.120 --> 38:15.600
 my 13 year old sister and kicked her out in the middle of winter, a couple feet of snow on the

38:15.600 --> 38:23.280
 ground because he thought she stole his favorite cereal bowl type. So yeah, that's when I took

38:23.280 --> 38:27.600
 in and I was going to college, put myself through college and I started taking custody of my

38:27.600 --> 38:35.120
 sisters and raising them. So anyway, we're still like very, very tight family. It took,

38:35.120 --> 38:40.480
 there was a few years later in life, like that the connection with my mother was

38:40.480 --> 38:46.240
 kind of broken. I didn't speak to her for years because of her basically abandoning

38:46.240 --> 38:50.800
 my sisters and me having to come in, but we've worked through that as best we can.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.040
 So you anger on your part?

38:53.040 --> 38:56.080
 It wasn't, there might have been some anger.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.320
 Did you always love her?

38:58.320 --> 39:05.040
 Yes, and I still do and I'm so, she's taught me basically everything I know about strength and

39:05.040 --> 39:12.320
 perseverance and living life on your terms and being able to, to create that and so much of

39:12.320 --> 39:21.920
 what I am is from that, right? We've all had to learn to be okay with the way she is because she

39:21.920 --> 39:29.760
 is just blunt, but you know, she's the one that figured out that the human trafficking situation

39:29.760 --> 39:40.320
 and got the DA involved and got all the, she's the one that I've learned a lot from her.

39:41.760 --> 39:43.280
 Did you inherit some of the demons?

39:44.160 --> 39:50.560
 Almost certainly. And it's something I've continued like in my father's side has been

39:51.680 --> 39:57.120
 really tough on that because some of it is just based genetic as well. So my stepfather made,

39:57.120 --> 40:02.800
 I think six or seven attempts on his life during his lifetime, one of those in front of me,

40:04.240 --> 40:11.280
 his mother blew her head off with a shotgun. Her brother jumped out a window in LA, their father

40:11.840 --> 40:16.240
 did something similar and I don't know how far back it goes because there is no family except

40:16.240 --> 40:21.360
 for me and my children. You spoke about going through depression yourself.

40:21.360 --> 40:26.640
 Yeah. Can you talk about some of the darker moments of that? Have you ever,

40:28.560 --> 40:31.520
 like many in your family, have you ever considered suicide?

40:31.520 --> 40:33.920
 Yes, I have. Yes, I have.

40:35.360 --> 40:40.880
 You've achieved a lot of exceptional things in your life. Can you talk about those early

40:40.880 --> 40:49.040
 days of depression and how you overcame it? Yeah. So the things that I did that people

40:49.040 --> 40:56.800
 give me accolades for are the things that I did selfishly to save myself. The things like taking

40:56.800 --> 41:04.720
 custody of my sisters, being the person that everybody around, you know, the important

41:04.720 --> 41:11.360
 people relied on, the fact that I had to step to the plate and be present and be that person.

41:11.360 --> 41:20.160
 Because if I failed, they failed. They would be like the people that I grew up with that

41:21.040 --> 41:30.240
 are dead or in prison or on drugs and they're either way to one of those, right? That's where

41:30.240 --> 41:35.360
 everybody ended and I wasn't going to let that happen. What about saving yourself?

41:35.360 --> 41:40.560
 And so that's how in those early days, that's how I did it. Not saying it's the best approach,

41:40.560 --> 41:46.320
 but it was survivor mentality. It was, I can't selfishly do that because I have them to take

41:46.320 --> 41:53.040
 care of, right? And then that continued where I would keep putting myself in these leadership

41:53.040 --> 42:00.560
 roles or other things and there's always being this person that was at the center at the hub that

42:02.400 --> 42:09.280
 forced me to be there. And so it's only in the more recent, you know, last decade or so that

42:09.280 --> 42:14.560
 I have had to really learn how to come and start confronting some of those demons.

42:15.840 --> 42:20.320
 And you think, man, why is the guy so successful? Like, I mean, and we haven't talked about all

42:20.320 --> 42:27.120
 the stuff that I've done, but like, I've seen a lot of success in both business leadership,

42:27.120 --> 42:36.320
 athletics, academics, entrepreneurship, all these sorts of things, right? But if it wasn't for,

42:36.320 --> 42:40.160
 you know, having kids and the same being in the position, I wouldn't be here.

42:42.560 --> 42:50.080
 And that's just, that's the reality of it. And I'm learning to come and manage those

42:50.080 --> 42:55.920
 as best I can, learning to meditate into those things and really feel what the driver is so I

42:55.920 --> 43:01.920
 can get to those, those root understanding and having some guidance doing so. Like, if you've

43:01.920 --> 43:05.920
 got mental health issues, this isn't something that you need to tackle on your own. Like,

43:05.920 --> 43:11.600
 having a professional that can help guide you on that introspective journey is, is something like,

43:13.200 --> 43:15.840
 it's not like, Hey, I'm big, tough guy. I can handle everything.

43:17.440 --> 43:26.320
 You know, that's fascinating that you saved yourself. That's quite powerful to save yourself

43:26.320 --> 43:33.120
 by having others depend on you. And so you can't fail. You can't fuck it up. And that's a reason to

43:33.120 --> 43:42.320
 keep moving forward. But on the flip side, that's not addressing the darkness. It's not. And it

43:42.320 --> 43:48.160
 probably not a sustainable strategy either, right? So I recognize these things. I don't know. And

43:49.840 --> 43:53.440
 perhaps it is sustainable. Perhaps, I mean, there's something beautiful about

43:54.400 --> 44:01.920
 giving yourself basically in service of others and thereby creating purpose.

44:01.920 --> 44:06.000
 And then like, it's almost like, fake it till you make it. And then you make it eventually.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.520
 Yeah, that is purpose, though. That is purpose. That is purpose. I mean, you have to, to me,

44:12.000 --> 44:18.880
 life is about taking your cup and how you choose to pour it out, how you choose to give. What is

44:18.880 --> 44:24.960
 your purpose? What is that connection with everybody around you? This is, that's, that's the

44:24.960 --> 44:30.240
 intent. That's the life. That's, that's what life is about. How are you going to help those around

44:30.240 --> 44:34.240
 you? How are you going to help the world? You know, your purpose is, is right here, figuring

44:34.240 --> 44:40.480
 out what this is. And then how to do that. But at the same time, you can't let that run dry. So

44:40.480 --> 44:46.800
 you have to make sure that you're filling that cup. That's the other side, right? That's the other

44:46.800 --> 44:52.000
 side. Yeah. We'll return to your engineering degree, which you're obviously scientifically

44:52.000 --> 44:57.280
 engineering minded, which is fascinating. Your book is titled The Eagle and the Dragon.

44:57.280 --> 45:04.160
 What do the eagle and the dragon symbolize? There are pretty big symbols for me, in fact,

45:04.160 --> 45:10.960
 that covers my entire body as a tattoo. So the first one I had done at around 19 years old,

45:10.960 --> 45:18.480
 man. So this is, or started at 19. It's an eagle that covers my entire front, you know,

45:18.480 --> 45:22.800
 my stomach, rib cage, and, and one that was on my back that covered most of my back and

45:22.800 --> 45:30.320
 there's chained at the, well, at the claw, I guess. And the chain wraps down around and

45:30.320 --> 45:35.440
 attaches to my ankle and there's a shackle there. And so this was something that I had

45:35.440 --> 45:42.240
 done at that age, because it was, to me, it was a representation of your potential,

45:42.880 --> 45:47.760
 your strengths, your abilities that you can fly to whatever height that you want in this world.

45:47.760 --> 45:53.680
 The only thing holding you back at the end of the day is yourself. And this was,

45:54.320 --> 45:58.720
 obviously, I hadn't necessarily accomplished a whole lot at that time. I mean, I was valedictorian

45:58.720 --> 46:05.520
 for high school, small high school. Does that even count? I was a state level wrestler.

46:06.560 --> 46:12.080
 This was my belief. And you sense that there was a potential in you and the only thing they

46:12.080 --> 46:18.240
 could stop you from realizing that potential was yourself. That's right. That's a heck of a tattoo

46:18.240 --> 46:24.080
 to get, by the way, at 19, but. Yeah. About 40 hours went into that thing.

46:24.080 --> 46:35.440
 It shows you got some guts. And then the next tattoo. So I only have two. I had done in 2015,

46:35.440 --> 46:42.240
 2016, when I, so at this point in my life. So I had done that. I had flown to whatever heights.

46:42.240 --> 46:49.920
 Right. So I had, I had proven to myself and maybe done what I thought I needed to do to

46:49.920 --> 46:56.480
 show the world that this poor kid from the sticks, this kid growing up in the mountains with nothing

46:57.120 --> 47:03.600
 could achieve the American dream. I was a corporate executive sought after that I'd come in,

47:03.600 --> 47:09.280
 I'd fix companies, I'd turn around and prep them for sale. I'd take a company and grow it from a

47:09.280 --> 47:14.160
 regional to a national to a global presence. I did this in the automotive manufacturing,

47:14.160 --> 47:20.800
 aerospace manufacturing, high tech, heavy industry. And I had a house with a white picket fence.

47:21.360 --> 47:26.880
 I was a successful athlete with all time world records. I owned a gym on the side where I coached

47:26.880 --> 47:35.280
 people and I had a comfortable marriage that everything was hunky dory with no arguments at

47:35.280 --> 47:43.440
 home. And I walked away from all of it. I left everything behind except for my kids.

47:45.120 --> 47:55.120
 I wanted to chase what I was meant to do and chase what I was capable of doing.

47:55.120 --> 48:01.280
 And I wanted to become a better version of myself, but very intentfully.

48:03.920 --> 48:09.680
 And that's what I did. I sold, I had multiple homes sold my homes.

48:11.840 --> 48:15.920
 I cashed in all my retirement that I'd earned for 20, nearly 20 years.

48:17.200 --> 48:24.000
 And I lost all that. I leveraged myself millions of dollars of personal debt so that if I failed,

48:24.000 --> 48:28.080
 there was no way out. Even going back to that old career that I did well,

48:28.080 --> 48:31.840
 I'd be living in an apartment the rest of my life paying it off.

48:33.120 --> 48:36.880
 People question, people question me at the time because I had a comfortable, easy marriage.

48:38.240 --> 48:45.840
 And I chose to ask for a divorce. And I ended up living in an apartment for a couple years

48:45.840 --> 48:51.600
 with no income, selling off every last thing that I had except for my two vehicles that I built.

48:51.600 --> 49:01.840
 And with my kids. And I started my businesses to help people live a better quality of life,

49:02.400 --> 49:10.080
 to get them out of pain, to help them live better through strength, to realize that stress,

49:10.080 --> 49:14.800
 demand, those things that they don't have to be the thing that, if you look back,

49:14.800 --> 49:18.560
 made you had the bad back, made you have the bad days, but they do the opposite. They get you

49:18.560 --> 49:23.360
 out of pain. And then I started working on my book to hit on those other things, the mental,

49:23.360 --> 49:28.800
 the emotional, maybe even spiritual. I don't touch on that one too much in there, but it's all the

49:28.800 --> 49:37.520
 same. That things that happen around you to you, like maybe they're bad, I can't take away that,

49:37.520 --> 49:41.680
 but why can't you use what you have of it to become a stronger and better person,

49:42.240 --> 49:46.400
 to become more resilient, to be able to take the things that you don't know that are coming

49:46.400 --> 49:52.080
 in the future. And so this is very intentful. And that's what the second long winded answer

49:52.080 --> 49:58.480
 in your question here, the dragon, the dragon, the dragon is an Auroboros. And so it is, it circles

49:58.480 --> 50:02.880
 my entire upper body, my shoulders, my back, my chest, everything is right here. There's this big

50:03.440 --> 50:06.960
 dragon head and its tail is right there in its mouth that's eating itself.

50:07.840 --> 50:13.520
 And it may sound a bit graphic or whatever, but it is, it's the eating of the old becoming

50:13.520 --> 50:18.880
 the new. It is the purposeful reinvention of oneself. It is the deciding,

50:19.920 --> 50:25.280
 not realizing just your potential, but deciding specifically who you want to be in this fucking

50:25.280 --> 50:32.480
 world and becoming that person. Can you comment on the value and the power of

50:32.480 --> 50:41.920
 putting a flame to your old life, your old self, just destroying all of it

50:43.120 --> 50:47.040
 as you walk into the new life? Did you have to do that?

50:47.680 --> 50:53.600
 I don't recommend this, by the way, because when you put yourself in no way out, there is no way

50:53.600 --> 51:06.320
 out. You got to really, but I can be an overconfident individual at times. And I live through

51:06.320 --> 51:13.280
 extremes. I think it's a great way of actually finding your real values and how you want to live,

51:13.280 --> 51:20.240
 honestly, to chase the having absolutely perfect squat technique, but chase putting every freaking

51:20.240 --> 51:24.800
 thing that you've got in it, which most people would say, those are opposite. Those are diametrically

51:24.800 --> 51:32.560
 opposed. I wanted a better home life. I wanted to do more in the world through my work.

51:34.320 --> 51:42.880
 And the burning the bridges mentality is not necessarily the best. There was some temperament

51:42.880 --> 51:48.720
 in that though, because I was slow to make the shift for a long time, because I'd been thinking

51:48.720 --> 51:52.880
 about doing it, but I was thinking about doing it in a healthcare perspective. I'm going to go back

51:52.880 --> 51:57.520
 to school to be a surgeon or a physical therapist or Cairo, because that's where all my research and

51:57.520 --> 52:04.320
 stuff was in this human movement and rehab and recovery. The mentors that I've been developing

52:04.320 --> 52:08.720
 were the best in the world in these things, in these disciplines. Those were my friends.

52:10.640 --> 52:16.800
 But I wasn't able to compromise my family's certain quality of life. I wanted to keep this.

52:16.800 --> 52:20.400
 So it was slow and hard for me to make that transition, but I didn't do it until

52:22.080 --> 52:26.880
 I had a platform built enough that those first few years, I did have an income. I was able to

52:26.880 --> 52:31.920
 make enough from the business until it grew so fast that I needed so much more needed to come in.

52:31.920 --> 52:35.040
 The living in the apartment piece and doing all that, there was actually a couple years

52:35.040 --> 52:42.400
 into that process, maybe like two years. I'm with you on that. So I'm actually going to that very

52:42.400 --> 52:49.120
 process now. I put everything, I quit everything, gave away everything and starting a new one.

52:50.160 --> 52:57.760
 Unfortunately, or fortunately, this podcast somehow became quite popular. So it's getting

52:57.760 --> 53:03.680
 in the way of my burning everything to the ground. But in that, it's a source of joy.

53:03.680 --> 53:08.640
 But the main thing I'm after is the similar project as you is building a business.

53:08.640 --> 53:14.800
 This sense of joy. So this, this is the point I want to drive home right now, right now.

53:15.600 --> 53:18.480
 Because when I say burnt, I learned that burning the bridges works because

53:19.920 --> 53:25.840
 that's how I had to succeed when I was earlier. The bridges weren't burnt. They didn't exist.

53:25.840 --> 53:29.840
 There was no couch to go home to. There was no, there was no fallback plan.

53:29.840 --> 53:33.120
 And it forced me and gave me the confidence to know that I can pull it off.

53:33.120 --> 53:40.080
 But I don't encourage people because there's so much out there of this hustle porn and other stuff

53:40.080 --> 53:45.520
 going, just grind, just go after it, get in and start your, like, you'll get there. And it's

53:45.520 --> 53:50.400
 all about the output to make money, to be somebody, to do this. And I'll tell you what,

53:50.400 --> 53:54.480
 that is some short term motivation right there. I feel like dropping a few swear words, but

53:56.560 --> 53:57.360
 You're always welcome.

53:57.360 --> 54:04.640
 We've already done a few. So we'll, we'll bounce it out. That is short term.

54:04.640 --> 54:08.720
 That is not going to keep you going. This neat, if you're going to go that approach,

54:08.720 --> 54:14.160
 it needs to be because this is your North Star. There's going to be so much hard work.

54:14.160 --> 54:18.160
 There's going to be years of just pushing through where your quest,

54:18.160 --> 54:21.680
 not only is everybody around you questioning you and your family's questioning you,

54:21.680 --> 54:25.440
 you're questioning yourself going, man, I don't know if I can pull this off.

54:25.440 --> 54:28.000
 You're going to be stressed. You're going to be pulled to the max.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.600
 If somebody comes up to me and says, should I start a business? I'm going to say no.

54:33.840 --> 54:37.440
 And oh, you're supposed to motivate me. If you need me to motivate you,

54:37.440 --> 54:41.920
 this is the wrong damn approach for you. This is going to be hard. This is going to be harder

54:41.920 --> 54:49.600
 than you expect even with me telling you this. And so it better damn well be worth it.

54:49.600 --> 54:56.720
 This better be your North fucking star. This better live and be a way for you to be able to

54:56.720 --> 55:04.080
 articulate or realize those values that you want to live. This isn't something to make money.

55:04.080 --> 55:10.480
 This is a way for you to live the life and be able to share the values that you have with the world.

55:11.360 --> 55:15.280
 And that's what it is. And if you don't have that, which is going to give you joy,

55:15.280 --> 55:22.720
 then freaking walk away. This is not some way to make some money and be known.

55:23.440 --> 55:28.000
 I mean, this includes both like simple day to day joy and also deep meaning,

55:29.200 --> 55:34.000
 the whole thing. And then that allows you to overcome all the pain along the way.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
 But I got to say, I mean, it's a difficult thing because you run a business.

55:38.000 --> 55:45.200
 This podcast and a lot of things I do research wise is full of joy, but it's simple.

55:46.240 --> 55:54.640
 Running a business is hard. So it's something that I'm very hesitant about

55:55.440 --> 56:04.400
 in that almost push back a little bit. I think if I do get the guts to start the business,

56:04.400 --> 56:10.000
 it will not be because I'm not choosing a more joyful life because I'm already truly happy.

56:11.120 --> 56:16.000
 The reason I'll choose is because I just can't help it. I've always had this dream

56:17.440 --> 56:23.440
 and I know it's going to lead to suffering and I know it's going to be a life that has less

56:23.440 --> 56:29.680
 happiness in it. As sad as this to say. But it won't be. It won't be less happiness.

56:29.680 --> 56:34.880
 Because we talk about this cup and where you choose to pour it and what you choose to do with it.

56:34.880 --> 56:39.280
 And when you look back on things, the things that are going to give you the most joy,

56:39.280 --> 56:43.440
 the most proud, the things that are going to stand out in your life that you really remember

56:43.440 --> 56:50.080
 are going to be those days. And those years you struggle, you're going to look back on

56:50.080 --> 56:57.440
 10 years later and go, fuck, those were the glory days. Those were the glory days.

56:57.440 --> 57:04.000
 Yeah. And it won't feel like it at the time. Yeah. It's so weird. That's what life's made of.

57:04.560 --> 57:09.280
 And so this is your, this is your opportunity. You feel that. So right now you got this when

57:09.280 --> 57:13.280
 you think about it. You got this little thing twisting up in your gut, right? It's like,

57:13.280 --> 57:20.160
 it's a mixture of anxiety and fear as well as excitement. And that is, that's your signal

57:20.160 --> 57:24.880
 that this is your opportunity for that personal growth to challenge yourself. This is your

57:24.880 --> 57:30.880
 going for a run or working out in the heat. It's, it's those things. It is your opportunity to go

57:31.760 --> 57:38.640
 that maybe it even fails. Maybe it even fails. But by turning into that, you're going to learn

57:38.640 --> 57:43.280
 so much and it's going to make you so much better. And it's the path that you should take when you

57:43.280 --> 57:50.800
 have this stuff rolling around in there. And I don't, it could just be a hard conversation with

57:50.800 --> 57:58.480
 your partner or your boss. It could be taking on a project that, you know, the, you know, the,

57:58.480 --> 58:02.160
 your bosses thrown out to the team and you're like, I'm going to hide in the back. I don't want that

58:02.160 --> 58:08.880
 one. And it's like, maybe, maybe you do. Maybe it's going back to school. Maybe it's making that

58:08.880 --> 58:15.440
 career move that you always wanted, but you're just a, you're just afraid of all these things

58:15.440 --> 58:24.320
 are your opportunity for you to turn into that. It is your workout. It is your practice. Because

58:24.320 --> 58:29.440
 if you don't, you'll get soft and who knows what's coming and you're not going to be ready for it.

58:29.440 --> 58:35.200
 And it's going to run right over the top of you because you're going to be weak. You're going

58:35.200 --> 58:42.480
 to be soft. There's some aspect in which choosing that hard path is actually the way to arrive at

58:42.480 --> 58:48.880
 the richest kind of happiness. Like the, the, the greatest fulfillment. That's the funny thing about

58:48.880 --> 58:53.840
 just the, but just make sure you're filling the cup as you're going through it. So that's,

58:53.840 --> 59:00.080
 that's the part to figure out, right? Sure. Well, life is short anyway. Eventually,

59:00.080 --> 59:07.600
 eventually the cup will be empty. So maybe time the refilling of the cup correctly. So you maximize

59:07.600 --> 59:14.960
 the little time you got. Let me talk to you about strength a little bit. First, high level, what

59:14.960 --> 59:18.640
 are the differences in the different disciplines of strength? So powerlifting we talked about,

59:19.520 --> 59:26.720
 maybe just to clarify for people, powerlifting, Olympic lifting, just regular gym fitness,

59:26.720 --> 59:31.920
 bodybuilding, doing curls in front of the mirror for hours like I do. What's, what's the difference

59:31.920 --> 59:38.560
 between all of these? Oh, and also strongman. Everyone of those as far as the athletic disciplines

59:39.520 --> 59:46.480
 are different qualities. So we want to think about things as terms of quality. So there's strength,

59:46.480 --> 59:55.200
 there's power, there's endurance, there's the ability to be coordinated and athletic. There's

59:55.200 --> 59:59.760
 all these things and they're different, they're different qualities. So your training as it relates

59:59.760 --> 1:00:06.720
 to that is how you cycle in the development of those qualities. What we want to think about is

1:00:06.720 --> 1:00:12.720
 there's a lot of different frames of thought, some very classical, maybe not classical Russian

1:00:12.720 --> 1:00:16.400
 approach, because there's a lot of different approach from the Eastern block. But one of the

1:00:16.400 --> 1:00:21.280
 ones is developing all the qualities at once, you know, focusing on building those. More of a

1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:29.760
 periodization effect would be focusing on one quality at a time or one quality while maintaining

1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:34.320
 other qualities and then shifting that around. So it's just going to be a little different based

1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:40.240
 on what the output is and what the desired. So like powerlifting is actually, power is the wrong

1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:46.880
 word, there's actually no power in it, it's just brute, it's strength, application of force.

1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:50.960
 So Olympic lifting would actually be a better name for powerlifting,

1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:58.560
 because that is more explosive development. There's strongman is again, now we're getting

1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:03.360
 a little bit more athletic, it's equipment based on the implements and stuff that are used,

1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:08.960
 how fast you can move your feet and run mixed with more endurance, but still very strength

1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:13.040
 focused. And there's some things with strongman that is straight, like each one of these is very

1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:20.160
 also focused on different genetic dispositions. So actually, if you look at the history of sports,

1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:24.720
 you'll find that they're a lot of times based on different populations. And that sounds like

1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:31.040
 it's very on PC, but like Highland games, they've got deep deeper hip sockets that are shallow.

1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:35.360
 So you're going to see a lot of short hip hinge movements like the, the caber toss and things

1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:40.800
 like that. Muay Thai wrestling, they've got a completely different hip joint. And so strongman

1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:45.280
 itself is going to be for very large frame individuals. If you're not well over six foot

1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:49.360
 and a large person, you're probably not going to perform well. Very few people at sub six foot

1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:55.840
 have ever done well at strongman just because it's, it's leverage based, right? Olympic lifting.

1:01:55.840 --> 1:02:03.920
 We see consistently in Europe, the, the history tells us a high level of hip

1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:09.840
 and back issues because of the depth that that hip socket has to go in to be able to

1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:14.560
 complete that lift. And so you're going to see issues with populations that don't have the

1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:20.560
 ability to do that. So, so we've talked a little bit about training as well as disposition.

1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:26.160
 Yeah. So, and also cross head to that, that's more like strongman, but for a wider variety of

1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:30.720
 bodies, I suppose. Yep. And definitely more metabolic conditioning focus than the, than

1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:38.080
 the strength aspect of it. And, and conditioning is an interesting thing too. So that quality,

1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:43.760
 in my opinion, can be developed a lot faster, but kind of peaks much faster as well. So

1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:51.920
 where strength, we can continue to add and add and add over time. So it's, for me, like for

1:02:51.920 --> 1:02:56.640
 conditioning with any strength athlete, I don't like to spend as much time on that. So I'll cycle

1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:02.960
 the conditioning work for our strength athletes and then taper that off leading into meat. So the

1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:07.920
 more metabolic work that means the more capacity in strength training that you can accomplish

1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:15.360
 which is the goal and recover from. But then as we lead to a competition, we want to spend more

1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:20.160
 time on recovering from that. So we have to pull things out. So we'd pull out less. So like typical

1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:26.400
 approach would be like taking a six week cycle for conditioning and ramping, ramping up over

1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:31.440
 three weeks periods time, then dropping back down again, and ramping up and being slightly offset

1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:35.920
 by like a week or two from your strength peaks. So that you've actually tapered the week prior

1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:40.560
 in your conditioning work to your strength work. But that way we're not hitting conditioning hard

1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:45.920
 all the time, which is a common misstep that people make is going, well, I need conditioning. So

1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:50.480
 they just hammer that at a base level over the top instead of cycling that.

1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:56.400
 If we talk about powerlifting in terms of regimen,

1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:04.240
 in terms of exercise, in terms of the process, the wood consistent with what,

1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:08.480
 is there something to be said about general qualities of the consistency of the regimen

1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:16.000
 required to get strong? Yes. So let's talk about some training principles as a whole.

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:22.000
 And this will, I think this will break the down what you're, what you're wanting. The more work

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:28.560
 that we can fit into a given time, the more progress we're going to make. But that doesn't

1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:37.120
 mean doing the max amount of work possible at any given time. So we know that we're always to,

1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:40.880
 to accomplish more, we're always going to have more. And there's a certain seemingly that you're

1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:45.200
 going to hit that you're not going to be able to add more. So you want to start and get the most

1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:51.200
 amount of results that you can with the least amount of work, because you're going to have to do it

1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:57.920
 again, like this stair step over and over year, decade, so on. So when people, this is a big

1:04:57.920 --> 1:05:03.760
 miss, people got they look at a Chico program from Russia or so on, and they go, I'm going to follow

1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:08.480
 this. And it's like, that was specifically written for somebody with 20 years of experience,

1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:13.440
 that's already built the capacities to be at that level. So it's all about building that work

1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:18.160
 capacity. So how much work can you give in a given time? So now we want to look at some research,

1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:24.080
 is it relates to injuries, because injuries are going to be a big driver over time of what

1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:31.600
 holds you back. So when we talk consistency, training hard for three years, five years,

1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:35.680
 it's going to be really good. But what we find is a lot of people train really hard for nine months,

1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:40.720
 have to slow back for a month, get back into it, then miss another week, because and so on,

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:45.840
 they're always like this little nagging, that little nagging. And so it's pretty clear in the

1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:51.760
 research, we want to, we're looking at when we're stair stepping this stuff, we're looking at acute

1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:58.640
 and chronic loading. So some fancy words for average and like what's happening right now. So

1:05:58.640 --> 1:06:03.840
 this given week would be our acute, chronic would be what is our average loading, let's say over

1:06:03.840 --> 1:06:10.240
 the last six months. Okay, so the more that we can move the chronic loading up, the more work

1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:14.960
 we're getting done on as a whole over time, we're going to get stronger. The way that we build the

1:06:14.960 --> 1:06:23.280
 capacity to do that is having spikes in acute loading. Okay. Now, the, as we do this, the,

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:32.160
 the acute loading, if it spikes more than 10, maybe 15% from what the chronic loading has been,

1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:41.440
 that accounts for 80% of injuries out there. So it's not actually the movement quality or this

1:06:41.440 --> 1:06:46.720
 misstep or the other. It usually happens about four or five, six weeks later. It's like, oh,

1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:50.320
 this nagging, and then it gets worse. And then now you got to, you got to do some rehab, your

1:06:50.320 --> 1:06:54.480
 training sessions aren't as good and so on. So now we're starting to look at this. Okay. It's like,

1:06:54.480 --> 1:07:00.880
 I want to do the, I want to do the least amount of work where I can still progress. I want to be

1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:09.520
 able to have spikes in my weekly demand that don't go above 10 to 15% of what I've been averaging

1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:15.120
 for the last month. But every time I do a spike, my, my average goes up, right? Boom, boom, boom.

1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:21.200
 And then that becomes very particular also when you take, when you do take plan time off. So a lot

1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:26.880
 of people, uh, training session, maybe they're doing a five week block with a, a, a D load week,

1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:32.240
 or you go on vacation for a week, or any of those things that were a downward, what does that do

1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:35.680
 to your average and chronic loading? It brings it down. And then what does the person want to do

1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:41.280
 when they come back? Make up for it. Now they have a huge spike above five weeks later, we're

1:07:41.280 --> 1:07:45.840
 dealing with, oh, his elbow, this wrist, whatever's kind of bothering me. And now you're not performing

1:07:45.840 --> 1:07:52.640
 as much. So these are some really fundamental pieces of, of, of training. And then now we can

1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:56.800
 start overlaying the qualities that we're trying to develop that we were talking about earlier. So

1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:02.000
 now it's, let's talk about my deadlift, my 1000 pound deadlift. We'll talk about the training

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:08.400
 cycles for both the 1000, uh, deadlift and squat. So backing up a year out from the deadlift,

1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:15.120
 knowing I was training at the time, heavy deadlifts once a week. And usually it was two of those

1:08:15.120 --> 1:08:19.440
 sessions a month were really heavy and the others weren't. And it's like, okay, how can we get this

1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:26.080
 up to where I'm deadlifting twice a week? Because that's where I want to be, uh, to be able to

1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:30.400
 accomplish this. I need to be loading about that much with frequency, with a certain volume to

1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:33.600
 be able to accomplish this goal. We're not going to go through all the math and stuff like that

1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:38.880
 and how that's arrived, but there is math, there is math behind this. And so instead of just like,

1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:45.040
 oh, let's start deadlifting twice a week. No. So we start and we take the one session that we've

1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:50.640
 got and we split it part of it, take part of it away and put it in the second half of the week.

1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:57.360
 So the total volume is still the same. And then, um, we start adding some volume, but I'm doing it

1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:02.480
 at a off a block so that the actual load is accumulative load is less because I have less

1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:07.360
 range of motion. Okay. And then we start building that closer to the ground, closer to the ground

1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:12.000
 and so on. And now we start getting to where I'm almost doing two sessions, full sessions a week.

1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:18.320
 And then we start adding a little bit of load. And so at my level, this isn't talking about

1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:25.120
 adding another set or another day a week. We're talking like in my squat, it might be one rep

1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:33.520
 instead of doing three sets of three at one week, I do two doubles or two triples, then two doubles

1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:40.640
 to give me one more rep. That's it. And so we're doing that from one week to the next. And that's

1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:44.720
 a cycle training cycle. It might be five, six weeks and then so on. And the next one and slowly

1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:51.760
 bringing that average load up. So the last phases of the squat, for example, we took the average

1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:56.480
 loading every week. So my of my heavy sets. So once we developed all this stuff over the last

1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:04.720
 year to get to this point, now it is taking and going, okay, my average load this week is eight

1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:13.760
 reps at 955 pounds. And then the next week, let's get it to 957. 963. And this was pretty

1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:19.280
 aggressive. Working up to where my average loading the final that the final was 985 pounds,

1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:23.680
 average load for eight to nine reps. And that's why I said, this is the intense part. That was

1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:28.560
 why it was the day of was much easier. That week over week is pretty brutal.

1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:34.000
 May not sound, oh, you're just squatting. And now let's back up. Let's look at the quality

1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.960
 development. So a year out from the squat, obviously, they've been working on developing

1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:44.800
 axial load capacity, my capacity to withstand load from top to bottom. So I like thinking about

1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:50.240
 things in movement vectors. So this vector is an axial loaded vector is the hardest to recover from.

1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:54.480
 So what's axial? So like, is deadlift? Are they both?

1:10:54.480 --> 1:11:00.880
 They're both. Yep. So a horizontal front to back would be like a row or a press.

1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:06.400
 Why is the axial hardest to recover? Because it's the entire body, the entire body, just anything

1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:15.680
 that is that taxes the spinal mechanics, I don't, I could tell you my beliefs. It studied, it is.

1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:23.120
 Okay. We can just keep the discussion on that the short like that. So we start looking at those

1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:27.680
 different vectors that we're training in. So this is why this is important to understand. So I'm

1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:33.040
 not just getting into nuance here. So, hey, squatting is going to make me make me jump further

1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:40.320
 because it's legs. Well, squatting is an axial load vector. And jumping is a vector this way.

1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:45.840
 So actually hip thrust would help with your, your, and this is proven in science,

1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:51.200
 with your forward jumping ability. They're both working similar muscles, the glute extension,

1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:55.600
 but they're working it in those different platforms. So it's really important to understand

1:11:55.600 --> 1:12:00.160
 because people don't understand I'm building my work capacity by doing sled pushes.

1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:03.200
 You're not developing your work capacity for squatting.

1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:11.280
 Most movements, even ones as holistic as a, as a squat require specialization.

1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.880
 Yeah. You can't get strong at the squat by doing.

1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:20.000
 You're going to have some carryover, right? Obviously. But because taking an untrained

1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.840
 person that hasn't done it is still not going to do as good as somebody that's

1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:27.920
 done nonspecific work, but done work. So, but yes, for the most part.

1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:33.760
 To get truly strong, you need to specialize. So, but not all the time. So now we talk about

1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:38.640
 qualities. So, and if we specialize in the same thing too long, we stagnate because the body

1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:44.480
 adapts to a certain point and just can't make progress. So we wanted to save the actual squatting

1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:49.840
 in the pattern with the bar that I was doing for the very end. So starting a year out,

1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:56.160
 I started doing work front squatting, like a squat axial loaded pattern and worked on

1:12:56.160 --> 1:13:03.680
 maximizing that up. Then I started shifting to doing transformer bar squat. It's this bar I

1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:07.840
 developed that actually changed and manipulates spinal mechanics. So I started loading in these

1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:12.640
 more forward positions and being able, again, so now I'm getting closer than a front squat,

1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:17.680
 but not quite squatting. And then I would start adjusting that bar every training cycle to closer

1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:21.680
 to a squat, toaster to a squat till it finally was, right? So what's the difference between a

1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:29.360
 front squat and a regular back squat? Like in terms of the stress on the body, the mechanics,

1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:33.200
 was there something interesting to be said about? Like how fundamentally different are they?

1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:38.400
 So what's interesting, people think about the weight in position to them like, oh, the bar's

1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:44.960
 in front of me, the bar's behind me, which is not the case. The bar is above your midfoot.

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:52.480
 The load is above your midfoot. So we're actually manipulating the spine behind the bar. So we're

1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:57.680
 causing spinal upriding behind the bar, getting in a more erect position, which is going to change

1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:02.320
 the relationship of the hip angle. It's going to change our ability to maintain the spine. It's

1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:09.360
 going to change the how much the core comes in, how hard it is to maintain that sternum to diaphragm

1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:14.080
 relationship that we talked about. All this stuff starts changing. So the bar stays in the same

1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:19.440
 place. Bar's still behind you, but the load moves around. So, but we're actually manipulating the

1:14:19.440 --> 1:14:25.200
 spine around the load. It's incredible. We can tailor it to an athlete, which is great when

1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:29.360
 you got a seven foot plus tall baseball player or basketball player. That's why we work with all

1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:33.360
 these teams. Anyway, so it's like you're taking something and getting closer and closer to it.

1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:38.000
 At the same time, we're looking at the quality. So like, I needed to be able to really hold this

1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:41.760
 torso position with the weight moving up here. Now, unlike the deadlift, the ability to manage

1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:47.680
 this TL position becomes much more challenging. So that was also why I was choosing the transformer

1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:52.480
 bar because it actually challenges that more in those big forward positions. I was also working

1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:57.520
 on my back strength tremendously to be able to hold the maintained position. So there was a lot of

1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:03.600
 like, I chose a bent over rows. So bent over row is a mixed vector. So it's a forward to back. So

1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:09.680
 it wouldn't have as much carrier, but it's also got some axial loading component in it as well.

1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:14.080
 So we're working on that. And then as it as we get closer and closer to competition,

1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:18.480
 I'm developing those strengths, but now I need to start tapering those out. So all of my recovery

1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:24.720
 needs can now go into the more specific that I'm actually ramping the load up. So as I'm ramping

1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:29.680
 the load on the weight, I'm able to ramp it a lot faster because I'm tapering out the other

1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:35.040
 stuff so I can still keep my total load high, but now get it very, very specific.

1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:41.520
 Wow. So everything I've done has always been kind of an annual training cycle. And then again,

1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:45.360
 this was like a, this was a five year training cycle, but we just kind of walked through the last

1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:51.840
 year of each and you can see how these concepts play out in reality. So in the cycling, so this

1:15:51.840 --> 1:16:00.400
 is both for you, but also for more recreational strength athletes, let's say there's variety

1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:07.120
 injected into the system. You need variety. Yeah. Yeah. Because you will basically stagnate at some

1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:12.800
 level, right? So you should always be kind of shifting a little bit. So three to four month

1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:19.440
 blocks in general for an average, you know, just a gen pop fitness is pretty good where you're going

1:16:19.440 --> 1:16:24.240
 to spend more time maybe in a higher rep range or lower rep range, a little bit more work on

1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:29.360
 endurance capacity or maybe some more time. Hey, I'm playing around with boxing or jiu jitsu or

1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:32.640
 something like that. Bring that a little bit more to the front, forefront for a while and bring the

1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:38.240
 other out, but like mixing, mixing those variables up, but trying to keep the total load the same

1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:42.880
 and always kind of like, yeah, do we add a little more? Again, it doesn't have to be major and it

1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:48.480
 shouldn't be major. You don't want these big jumps. You don't go, oh my God, let's move. Let's jump

1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:56.640
 into squatting every day. You've got to build the capacity to do that. It's simple. What role would

1:16:56.640 --> 1:17:02.880
 you say strength has in sports that combines skill and strength? So for me personally, maybe

1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:10.880
 I'll just ask it selfishly, which is grappling, wrestling, MMA. Yeah. How about I start with

1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:19.680
 baseball? Please. No, I would. Okay. The sport. Okay. Like baseball and golf are two of my favorite

1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:26.160
 sports. No, I don't, you don't have to be in shape at all to excel at those sports. Well,

1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:31.520
 here's the thing. There we go. We're going to get this argument. Well, I've got a perfect example

1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:36.720
 because this is why I sell so many transformer bars into the Major League Baseball. So they get

1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:43.440
 these people that come in, these athletes that have been baseball their whole life. It is part

1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:48.800
 of the culture. And so they're great athletes. They've got all the skill. The only thing they

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:55.360
 have to do is develop a little bit more resilience so that they don't have the injury. They can push

1:17:55.360 --> 1:18:00.720
 their training a little bit more that they can add a little bit more force output and be able to

1:18:00.720 --> 1:18:05.600
 recover from it. So the only thing they've got to do is add some training, but there's no training

1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:10.160
 culture there. So they don't have any experience, which is why they love the transformer bar because

1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:13.120
 they don't have to worry about teaching the technique. We can actually set the bar on a setting

1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:17.120
 that makes their squats perfect by queuing all the stuff with actually not having to coach it.

1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:21.040
 Because when you're coaching a room full of athletes, it's really hard to teach the nuance

1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:26.000
 of all this and not sure that all that. But that's all that they have to do with these players with

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:33.120
 a huge level of skill. So once you reach a certain level of skill, adding strength is the only real

1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:41.040
 forward path. So that's the basic simple answer to that. So one of the benefits there being like

1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:46.880
 injury prevention, actually. Injury prevention, resilience. Because especially fighting sports,

1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:51.520
 you're going to be challenged and thrown and other things happen to you. And the more resilient you

1:18:51.520 --> 1:18:56.880
 can make your structures, the better you're going to be. Even a cyclist, mountain biking,

1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:00.560
 why would they need it? Why would they need to do upper body training? Take a crash, your shoulders

1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:07.840
 gone. You're done. Your career is over unless you've done a little training. Right? So there's

1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:14.160
 value in all this stuff. But the resilience is like, that's huge. And then we can overlay strength.

1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:19.040
 The people where we miss is this focus on strength when we haven't developed quality

1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:24.560
 motor patterns first. So this is a huge thing with children because people want to know what's

1:19:24.560 --> 1:19:30.880
 the appropriate training age. I'd had my daughter training before my son because she developed

1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:35.200
 movement patterns that have better quality earlier. There's no age because it's going to be very

1:19:35.200 --> 1:19:39.760
 dependent on the individual. There's no point in having adaptation if we don't have the right

1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:44.560
 thing to adapt to yet. And that applies to general movement, but also the sport. You're

1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:48.000
 saying the skills should be developed first and the strength applied on top of that.

1:19:49.200 --> 1:19:56.480
 Maybe you can educate me, but I actually quit lifting and powerlifting for a long time

1:19:57.600 --> 1:20:06.640
 after I started judo, jiu jitsu, grappling, all this sort of combat sports. Because I found

1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:15.520
 that it was preventing me from relaxing my body enough to load in the skill.

1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:24.320
 So this isn't a problem with the training. This is a problem with you. So this is actually

1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:31.840
 really, really important. The first product I ever released was a loadable mace, a swinging mace.

1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:38.800
 And because every powerlifter in body, well, not every, but most serious powerlifters and body

1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:46.160
 builders like shoulders mobility is pretty limited. And most of them really, really struggle with this.

1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:54.160
 The problem is they've been taught to have tension all the time. And that's not good. So when we

1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:57.680
 talk about the joint positions that we were talking about earlier and having those and the

1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:05.200
 muscles and the right length and tension relationship, athleticism is the speed to relaxation

1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:12.720
 because the counter is speed to, to speed to contraction, float like a butterfly, sting like

1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:19.280
 a bee, right? And so what a mace can do is use that because this ties back into a developmental

1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:24.160
 kinesiology because a lot of like reset patterns are getting back into these basic movements,

1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:30.720
 but it's as much about relaxation as it is contraction. Okay. So a mace, we have this weight

1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:36.240
 on a big long lever. So if I grab a kettlebell and it's the same movement as a kettlebell halo,

1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:40.560
 it is the same movement as a kettlebell halo. But here in the halo, I'm on the whole time.

1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:47.440
 With the mace at the proper length, with the right distribution, you cannot do the movement.

1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:52.400
 You could not move force your way through it. The only way that you can accomplish that

1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:59.360
 is by relaxing. And then now we, now we can contract all the muscles related around

1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:06.640
 that shoulder girdle all at once. We're working on off, on off, on off with moving and contracting.

1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:12.240
 And now, so what happens a lot of times as we, you know, this stiffness and tightness happens,

1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:17.920
 if we're in poor positions, we start using stabilizer muscles to do the movement. And then

1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:23.040
 that's where this stiffness come from. So it means that in some of whatever training that you're

1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:29.680
 doing, there's a deficit in the movement quality. Okay. Or there's a deficit in the training program

1:22:29.680 --> 1:22:34.080
 and you're not recovering from an 80% of the time, that's the right answer, right? But yeah,

1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:40.560
 that's where the, where the gap is and learning how to relax. And the way a lot of the exercises

1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:45.520
 are taught and have been taught for a long time, which is why there's a big gap. And this is why

1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:49.680
 both clinical rehab and all these other components are mixed in my philosophy and what I'm trying

1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:54.880
 to do with Kabuki strength, because I'm looking at holistic movement. I'm not looking at power

1:22:54.880 --> 1:23:02.640
 lifting. Base movements are what I want to load and be able to assess on. But this affects all

1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:08.720
 sports, all activities, and strength doesn't have to be that. I mean, I, I'm, I'm freaking a

1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:12.640
 thousand pound squatter and deadlifter. If you, if you watch any of my videos where I do like

1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:17.440
 complete quad fallbacks, I don't stretch at all. I can usually get close to a full split like if I

1:23:17.440 --> 1:23:24.160
 want to. What? No, I did not see those videos. Okay. That's, it's hard to believe. Wow, okay.

1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:29.040
 Well, actually, I do. I just did one recently, a quad fallback with my, with my mace loaded way

1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:33.760
 out to the end, torsioning on both end of the other. And I do a lot of, I do a lot of weird stuff.

1:23:35.200 --> 1:23:41.520
 That's awesome. Okay. Squatting doesn't make your hips tight. Squatting like shit makes your hips

1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:48.160
 tight. And so, but there is no perfect world where always our training program isn't quite

1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:52.240
 perfect. Our movements isn't necessarily perfect. Like, so you're going to have the needs for this

1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:57.840
 stuff. But if you're always have to do some soft tissue work to loosen up the same one

1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:02.560
 for that exercise to be able to get a joint in position, there is a problem. And I'm not saying,

1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:06.400
 don't do it, do it because I don't want you to have a joint. Like if I can't get my shoulders in

1:24:06.400 --> 1:24:11.200
 a position, I can't do overhead presses because I'm going to compromise my spine position. Then

1:24:11.200 --> 1:24:14.400
 I'm going to end up with some other problems, right? So go ahead and clean that up so you can

1:24:14.400 --> 1:24:21.840
 get in position. But go figure out why it is and fix it. And then maybe next, you know,

1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:25.840
 three, four months from now, they're going to get a little something else going on, fix it,

1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:32.160
 but go understand the deeper root reason of why. So I'm, I believe I'm the only company

1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:37.200
 manufacturing and selling, you know, fascial soft tissue tools. And I'll tell you, I don't want you

1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:43.360
 to use them because it's not helping you get to the why, why it was caused in the first place.

1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:47.680
 The goal, the goal, the perfect state is not having to use them.

1:24:48.480 --> 1:24:52.880
 Reality is you're going to have to use them from time to time because the world's not perfect.

1:24:52.880 --> 1:24:59.760
 Yeah. So your discovery is 100% on point. Well, there's another side to combat sports.

1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:07.440
 When you're beginning a particular combat sport, strength can be a negative because

1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:11.600
 human psychology, because you can get away with a lot when you're stronger.

1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:12.880
 Uh huh. Yes, you can.

1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:20.640
 So if your mind is strong enough to where you can just turn off that advantage and be a beginner

1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:23.600
 truly in a particular art, that's probably the best way to do it.

1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:25.520
 But you can get away and then you don't learn.

1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:31.360
 Yeah. Yeah. It's hard. It's hard not to use the little

1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:39.040
 advantages you have because the jujitsu is a big hit on the ego for, you know, especially guys,

1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:45.680
 you know, when like a smaller person just destroys you, dominates you when you can,

1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:52.640
 I don't know, deadlift whatever number of pounds. And it's hard not to use that strength to then

1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:58.320
 resist the slow, the ultimate destruction by like 120 pound.

1:25:59.360 --> 1:26:04.160
 And that's why I recommend developing the skill quality first. But it doesn't mean that you can't.

1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:05.200
 I can't. That's right.

1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:08.960
 You can still do it. So that don't take it as a like, oh, I can't go that direction.

1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:13.760
 That's fine. But understand those things. And then also understand the jujitsu is

1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:17.920
 additional load on the body. So you have to, you can't just add it on top.

1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:18.400
 Yeah.

1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:23.040
 You've got to taper back the other, you're going to have to make a, I'm sorry, you may not want

1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:28.720
 to hear it, but you're not going to be able to do as much and add that here. Yeah.

1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:34.800
 It's a compromise because your total volume still has to be there. And there's not,

1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:39.920
 unfortunately, not really a way to measure what the jujitsu volume is with this. So you've got to

1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:44.640
 take a look at that. And that's where like measuring like heart rate variability or other

1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:50.240
 stuff can be useful. So you can see what is happening from me from a sympathetic versus

1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:52.400
 parasympathetic nervous system standpoint.

1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:55.840
 Yeah. Making sure your body recovers efficiently and trying to put numbers to it.

1:26:56.640 --> 1:27:02.000
 You mentioned Kabuki strength. You run the Kabuki strength lab previously called the

1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:09.280
 Elite Performance Center in Oregon. You called it the perfect gym. What makes for the perfect

1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:10.800
 strength training gym?

1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:11.760
 Where I called it the perfect.

1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:13.360
 In a video somewhere I watched.

1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:19.680
 Oh man. I mean, that's where my testing grounds for developing all this stuff was through the

1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:26.400
 years. And so this is like I said, I started developing relationships with the best developmental

1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:31.440
 kinesiologist in the US. The best arguably the best or most well known physical therapist in

1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:36.720
 the world. The best spine biomechanist in the world. I started doing continuing education

1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:40.960
 with these clinical courses and learning this stuff and going, but how does it work in my world?

1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:45.680
 Right. And then I started lecturing with them and all this other stuff, but the lab was like,

1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:50.240
 where do we test this stuff? Right. And so let me get to a point. There's three things.

1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:58.800
 There's always three things. So to be a success, to achieve success, I believe there's three things

1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:06.720
 that really, really come into place. And it's the right methodology, the right tools,

1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:15.040
 and the right environment. And so it was all about building that. And so the methodologies came from

1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:21.840
 a lot of that different, that gray area interaction of clinical with sports science, right? And then

1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:28.960
 the tools I had to start creating and designing. And then the environment is having this, you know,

1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:33.440
 focused environment of people that want to do better and push each other and having community

1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:38.800
 and culture, right? I end up building these connections, this network, everything that I'm

1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:45.280
 doing with my businesses is trying to create that into a scalable fashion. And so I'm building the

1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:50.480
 groundwork because to have a system that like, yeah, I had clinicals on site that knew exactly

1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:55.120
 what we were doing. And when it's me and a few people in a small team and all this stuff, we're

1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:59.760
 all just like easy to manage. And you can see these, there's other models around this. So

1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:03.840
 I've been other areas since maybe whenever it was I filmed that video that said that,

1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:09.040
 that they have that same, same model. And it's taken probably about a decade usually to develop

1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:13.520
 that, you know, and having the right people in this community, they can create this,

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:17.120
 this network and the tool and all this stuff, right? Except they still don't have the best

1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:25.280
 tools because kawaki strength didn't exist. But, but, and so out of that was, is essentially

1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:30.640
 started building this business and people like, when did you know how all this stuff was connected?

1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:35.760
 And I'm like, I don't know, I didn't, I just started creating on the outset, the things that

1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:42.000
 worked until finally, I'm like, Oh, I'm recreating a scalable version of this stuff. Here's the

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:46.720
 methodologies and a coaching platform that we can manage clients around the globe and see what's

1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:51.200
 working and not based on the scientific principles of training, right? How do we create that into a

1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:56.320
 database that now we can train new coaches and they can use those same metrics and tools to

1:29:56.320 --> 1:30:01.680
 create programs that are tailored to fit person's individual needs, right? Now, how do we integrate

1:30:01.680 --> 1:30:08.000
 that with assessment and clinical care assessment and, and, and all these other pieces. So there's

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.400
 a lot of work in that. And so that's where kabuki strength is the genesis. But we have,

1:30:12.400 --> 1:30:19.120
 we call our gym, the kabuki strength lab. Literally, people find about our gym in the

1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:23.200
 neighborhood. Like, how long have you been here? Why, why do I not know about this? We don't advertise

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:30.720
 our gym at all. So like, that makes no sense. Well, that's because the only reason is to have

1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:35.280
 a testing environment for the tools and methodology and having enough people to have

1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:38.880
 the culture and fit and to be able to be part of the experiment.

1:30:39.680 --> 1:30:45.600
 What about the environment of the, the feel of it, the actual gym? There's a, I don't know,

1:30:45.600 --> 1:30:54.400
 a grunginess to it. I recently became a member of Planet Fitness for, for reasons that have to do

1:30:54.400 --> 1:30:57.840
 more with the heat in Austin that sometimes they need to put in time in the treadmill.

1:30:59.200 --> 1:31:02.800
 I don't like that. I don't have any judgment, honestly. The best gyms I've been in

1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:09.520
 are kind of dirty. You walk in and you know that work is to be done. There's not another reason

1:31:09.520 --> 1:31:16.880
 to do there. It is the, the environment is tight. There's a big piece of that. I know it's

1:31:16.880 --> 1:31:23.520
 studied sociologically, I believe. I just, I just pictured that word too. But, but the intensity,

1:31:23.520 --> 1:31:30.560
 when you start growing a space, the intensity drops. And so I, I had that experience when we

1:31:30.560 --> 1:31:36.640
 grew, we went from a 4,000 foot to a 9,000 square foot gym at one time. And everybody's like,

1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:40.240
 it doesn't feel the same. Like if people are complaining for years, we've shrunk it back

1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:45.280
 down whenever down to 3,500 square feet. And it creates that intensity. It creates the closest,

1:31:45.280 --> 1:31:50.080
 the connection with the people around you. And then like I said, the grunginess, like you go in,

1:31:50.080 --> 1:31:54.480
 you know, the intention when you walk in, that environment creates that tension. But when I

1:31:54.480 --> 1:31:58.880
 speak environment, it's not just the, it's not the physical, it's the people. But you know,

1:31:58.880 --> 1:32:06.320
 when the gym is a little bit beat up. Yes. It also tells a story, like there's a history to it.

1:32:06.320 --> 1:32:11.360
 You could tell that not only is there work to be done, that work has been done here.

1:32:11.360 --> 1:32:16.720
 Yes. Like battles have been fought. There's something to that where you're just in a long line of

1:32:17.280 --> 1:32:23.760
 people, you know, that fought and won. And we could get into a whole nother space. So there's

1:32:23.760 --> 1:32:29.600
 to be a whole nother topic, but that existing energy of a space. I mean, we mentioned offline,

1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:34.000
 Joe Rogan, he talks about the same with comedy clubs. There's certain, there's certain clubs

1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:39.600
 that just have a history. There's an energy there. You can get all woo, but you know,

1:32:39.600 --> 1:32:43.680
 there, it's there. It's a real thing, I think. You walk in and you can feel it.

1:32:43.680 --> 1:32:51.440
 And you feel it. You feel it. Yeah. That makes me feel that somehow all of us humans are connected

1:32:51.440 --> 1:32:58.880
 in ways that's hard to describe, even the ones who are no longer here. Just the greatness that once

1:32:58.880 --> 1:33:06.480
 was is still in the walls, in the space present there. Yeah. And we somehow can plug into that

1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:12.720
 energy. Yeah. It's, we go down a, go down a path there. There's something really powerful there.

1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:19.120
 You've also mentioned a bunch of cool equipment that you've developed as part of Kabuki Strength.

1:33:20.400 --> 1:33:24.720
 Probably a little bit of that has to do with your engineering education, but also just

1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:32.560
 generally with the spirit of the innovator that you are. What are some cool, maybe revolutionary

1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:38.000
 pieces of equipment that you're particularly proud of or just you've been obsessed with

1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:42.560
 recently that you're developing? Yeah. Love to talk about that. So we've got some wild,

1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:49.200
 crazy stuff that just came out and is coming out too. So everything that we create and release

1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:56.160
 at Kabuki Strength, the industry hasn't seen before. There's stuff that's basic foundational,

1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:04.160
 it's been around forever because it works. But there's always more. It could be better.

1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:08.320
 And why are we not looking at these things, these foundational things? So when people are coming up

1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:12.240
 with novel things, they end up being way different outside the perspective. And I'm coming up with

1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:17.920
 things that are way different, that are plays on what we already know works. So we talked about

1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:21.280
 the Transformer Bar, the only bar in the world, we can manipulate spinal mechanics.

1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:28.480
 Everything for me from a design concept that we develop is all about creating

1:34:29.040 --> 1:34:34.880
 products that can rapidly accommodate to the variability of an individual's

1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:43.760
 leverages, mobility, and training needs. And that's going to also create and distill down the size

1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:48.320
 and scope of space that we need, which is going to continue to be an ongoing thing.

1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:52.240
 Check out my Instagram after this, and you'll see I put an entire gym on the bed of my truck

1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:57.920
 and went on vacation last week, drove to the desert. And by entire gym, I mean

1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:03.520
 squat rack, full complement of our specialty bars, a horizontal and vertical pulley system,

1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:09.600
 hand held weights, shoulder, like a complete, an entire gym in product that took up the space,

1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:15.840
 the size of this bed, right here. That's incredible. Because of the design scope of what we have.

1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:20.880
 So the cool things that there's two other bars that fit our biomechanically sound bar

1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:25.680
 bell lines, we talked about the Transformer Bar. The other two are built on this thing I

1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:31.760
 called playground physics. So we have these bars with handles that are off,

1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:38.080
 off parallel with the axis. So they've been around the market for a long time. One is a

1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:45.600
 hex bar or a trap bar. Another one is a, it's a pressing bar with the handles turned as well.

1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:51.440
 And both of them suck. They're horrible. Anytime any lifter knows if you pick it up,

1:35:51.440 --> 1:35:56.560
 it's going to break your wrist and crush into your face. And it just, it just doesn't feel good

1:35:56.560 --> 1:36:02.160
 pressing. But it alleviates the strain on the wrist. So people use it for that reason. And the,

1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:07.680
 the, the trap bar, same thing, it's always diving forward in your hand. So it's kind of limited,

1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:13.200
 it's also limited in use because you could do a lot more with it. So these bars are really

1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:23.360
 cool playground physics. So as soon as the center of rotation is on the same axis as the center of

1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:32.080
 mass and the handle is off center, you have, you have a teeter totter. So an a teeter totter has

1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:36.240
 a balance point, but it's infinitely perfect. So technically you can never find it. So always

1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:40.160
 going to be sitting on one side of the other in a playground. And that's what these bars are designed.

1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:43.920
 So you got instability right here. You can't find the center. The bar is always trying to tip in

1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:47.040
 your hands on the trap bar. So you can't do carries with it because you're doing forward

1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:52.240
 momentum and it wants to, it wants to dip on you, right? The Swiss bar wants to crush your face.

1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:56.960
 Well, what do we do? We just make a swing, put center of mass below center of rotation.

1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:05.120
 And what does it do? Oh, it always finds center. So, so the handles on the, our pressing bar,

1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:11.680
 it's arched so that the handles are above center of rotation. And then, and then every angle instead

1:37:11.680 --> 1:37:17.120
 of just being a certain fixed angles, each angle is based on the width, the average width of an

1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:22.960
 individual. So the internal and external rotational bias is based of the shoulder is based on the width

1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:26.560
 leaving just a little bit left because we talked about the lat being a stabilizer. You still need

1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:31.520
 to have a little bit of Q of external rotation to engage that as a stabilizer. Boom. Now all of a

1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:36.000
 sudden you have a bar and I kid you not, this is a great story. Major League Baseball, when I

1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:39.520
 presented it, every head strength coach for a Major League Baseball team, maybe not every, but

1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:44.960
 damn near most of them have bad shoulders. They can't press, they've gotten shoulder surgeries,

1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:48.640
 so on. And so we're showing, they love all our stuff and I'm like, hey, I've got this cool prototype

1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:52.880
 I want to show you, it's a pressing bar. And they're like, oh, you know, Major League Baseball is a

1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:58.640
 little hesitant on pressing because of the dangers for the shoulder. And I can't, I haven't been able

1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:03.360
 to take a bar to my chest. I mean, I really love to, it's been five years since I've been able to

1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:09.600
 XX train and I'm like, just try it. Like I can't even get a bar to my chest without pain. Like just

1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:15.680
 try it. Oh, that feels good. Now the arc makes it actually three inches deeper. So people are

1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:19.840
 automatically scared. I can't do that because that's an extra range of motion, right? Like, oh,

1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:23.840
 put a plate on there. They're doing it by the time the staffs like they're all standing around. You

1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:29.760
 see, like, what's going on? Put two plates on. You can see the, just like, it gets up. How do you

1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:38.880
 feel? Like, I feel fine. No pain at all. I did this with five teams with five of the happening

1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:45.440
 repeatedly five times that they and everyone of them worked up the two plates and did reps

1:38:45.440 --> 1:38:50.160
 varied with zero pain to a three inch range or greater range of motion because what did we do?

1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:53.440
 We stacked all the joints and we provided stability at the end that we balanced internal and

1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:58.800
 external rotation. I mean, just basic playground physics and it changed the game. Now we get a

1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:03.680
 greater range of motion with a greater training effect with the negative stresses removed. Our

1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:10.240
 trap bar opened up one side, which there was already some like that out there created. It pops up so

1:39:10.240 --> 1:39:15.280
 you can pick up take the weights on and off. It's got a built in jack and then created the high

1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:18.560
 handle position which already did everybody uses the high handle on a trap bar. They just don't

1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:22.960
 know why they like it. The handle that's on center we offset just a little bit not enough to make a

1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:27.360
 difference on the range of motion lift or even notice visibly, but it still has the same effect.

1:39:27.360 --> 1:39:32.640
 So both handles now have that. We added the option of different handle sizes based on whatever

1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:37.840
 your needs are, even a one that rolls to develop grip and then different widths that you could

1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:42.400
 choose from based on whether you're training a teen athlete or a seven foot six NBA player or a

1:39:42.400 --> 1:39:49.120
 NFL lineman so that we can accommodate for all these differences. And so and then now it becomes

1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:53.920
 the most functional all around bar around because now you can do carries with it. You can do split

1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:58.000
 squats with it. You could do curls with it because it goes around the body. You can do overhead

1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:01.600
 presses because you don't have a thing that gets in your way and you can flip it up into position.

1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:06.160
 You can do bent over rows and not run into your shins. You can do seal rows off of a bench. You

1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:10.400
 can do ab rollouts. You could, should I go on? Yeah, so you can use it as like the main bar.

1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:14.880
 The best multi purpose bar around. You got a home gym, one bar. Like how do you develop

1:40:14.880 --> 1:40:22.320
 totally new equipment like this? I scratch it on paper, maybe weld some cut up and weld up a

1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:27.920
 prototype, but usually I just hand the scratched up paper to my engineering manager and that's

1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:32.560
 what he says his job is to distill my chicken scratch into something real. And then that team

1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:39.840
 picks it up. But in the old days starting out, I just walk out and do it. You talk about engineering,

1:40:39.840 --> 1:40:45.040
 I'm actually more, I work more of an artist fashion. It's in my head and I just go create with no

1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:49.680
 plans. And so they have to pick that up and actually do the engineering and testing and all

1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:53.920
 that. And then we got two other products came out this year, freaking wild. Are you familiar

1:40:53.920 --> 1:41:00.080
 training with a flywheel? No, no, it's a flywheel. Maybe. A flywheel is a spinning object

1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:05.600
 that creates an inertial mass. Yeah. And then it reverses direction. So whatever you put into it,

1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:12.000
 there's ones out there. But ours is the first patent pending that's all everything all in

1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:16.560
 one unit. So it's a floor based as well as a horizontal. So you can basically do any pulley

1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:20.720
 movement in the world. And now everything that you put into it on a concentric force, it whips

1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:26.000
 right back as peak centric load. Gotcha. So there's an accelerating whipping motion.

1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:33.280
 Yeah, basically. Yeah. I mean, okay, I have trouble imagining exactly. Many of the things

1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:39.040
 you're describing, I suppose have to be experienced, right? Yes. Because there's a magic to it.

1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:42.960
 And there's a lot of research they've been around. They're adopted more heavily in Europe,

1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:47.120
 quite heavily in Europe, but not as much in the U.S. Because they sell them as a be all end all

1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:52.640
 tool, which they're not. They're crazy for what they do. But it's not the, it's another tool. And

1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:57.840
 so we have a very high quality unit now that is half the cost of everybody else's because

1:41:58.480 --> 1:42:02.080
 the innovation of a movable mount point that you, for them, you have to have

1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:07.600
 two pieces of equipment. We have one. So, and then a few other things, better platform to be able

1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:13.680
 to do things and that we can do what we call off platform work, which allows us to do movements,

1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:18.880
 like punches and standups, things like that. And then I've got a handheld weight coming out next

1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:25.200
 month that we can actually play with. So varying the load with it never leaving your hand by changing

1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:31.280
 the leverage point. And so what are we, what exercise that we're talking about here?

1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:36.320
 Anything that would be a dumbbell or a kettlebell movement. So it functions, it does the function

1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:40.640
 of a kettlebell, a dumbbell and what we call a center mass bell, as well as provides variable

1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:47.600
 loading within a range. So how can you change, like, how can you change the load? Because load,

1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:52.480
 well, we don't actually change the load. We change the torque on the, on the joint that we're working,

1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:57.280
 which is the same. That's actually what is creating the force, right? So if I'm doing a front raise,

1:42:57.280 --> 1:43:03.680
 it's where this, this downward forces times the distance away, right? Which also then makes

1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:07.280
 it no force when I've got at the bottom of the front raise, which is why it's so easy.

1:43:07.280 --> 1:43:12.880
 With this, it's like a kettlebell, it's offset, except it has three different handles. But it's

1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:16.560
 offset just that a kettlebell, you can't do it because the offset so far, it becomes a wrist

1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:22.160
 movement. So ours has three different sizes in the offset just enough, so that you can pick,

1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:25.600
 if I put it in a front raise position or curl position, I could put it in outward position.

1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:31.040
 And the force is almost what it is at the, at the top, but then I get the top and it's the same

1:43:31.040 --> 1:43:35.840
 exact or the curl. So I can actually change the force curve in the movement. And then I can just

1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:39.280
 release the pressure a little bit and let it swing into position and keep doing a drop set with

1:43:39.280 --> 1:43:43.680
 never letting it down. Yeah. So it's got a really nice texture grip that allows you to hold it in

1:43:43.680 --> 1:43:48.400
 different positions. And then the load offset is just enough that it doesn't overpower the wrist.

1:43:48.400 --> 1:43:52.560
 And then you got different hand sizes so that you can maximize this relationship and hit

1:43:52.560 --> 1:43:57.520
 whatever joint that you're applying. So sounds incredible. It's really freaking awesome because

1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:02.240
 you can, because the variable load, now I could go straight from front raises to side raises or rear

1:44:02.240 --> 1:44:05.680
 or curl because without like putting it down, because I don't have to put it down. So now my

1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:10.640
 time under tension goes through the roof. And by the way, the same effect with a flywheel trainer

1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:16.160
 because the variable, whatever you put into it is what it kicks back. So you have an constant

1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:19.360
 time under tension because there's no rest points either. So all this stuff is working on

1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:26.240
 maximizing time under tension, which anyway, it's cool stuff. Anyway, I get excited.

1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:31.280
 Well, let me ask you about another thing you've already mentioned, but I find this really

1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:39.520
 interesting, which is barefoot running and your sort of company, Barefoot Athletics,

1:44:40.560 --> 1:44:47.120
 BEAR. And the tagline is optimizing the human to ground interface. We've talked about this a

1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:56.160
 little bit with the powerlifting. How do you think about the foot ground interface?

1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:05.600
 It's interesting that we know that we should train all these parts of our body to be able

1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:14.880
 to be stronger, be more resilient. But we think that the foot is different, that we need to package

1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:22.240
 it and somehow that that's the science of making it healthy. Where I challenge people,

1:45:22.240 --> 1:45:27.120
 think about that. First thing you do in the morning is roll out a bed and put your weight

1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:31.440
 lifting belt on and wrap it on tight and wear it till you go to bed at night. Do it with your

1:45:31.440 --> 1:45:37.360
 shoulders, your knees, wake up and put some knee wraps on and elbow wraps and see what happens.

1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:43.520
 One, you'll get weaker. You'll lose movement capacity and you'll start affecting other areas

1:45:43.520 --> 1:45:48.000
 of the body very negatively because they will start picking up the compensation for those joints

1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:55.600
 that are not moving properly. This is it. What shoes are for is to protect you from the environment,

1:45:55.600 --> 1:46:04.720
 from cuts and abrasions and heat and things like that. But the foot, the mind blowing is like every

1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:10.960
 other area of the body. You need to use it and you need to strengthen it and you need to learn

1:46:10.960 --> 1:46:16.720
 to control it. That's it. That's all I have to say about the subject. It's that simple,

1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:22.720
 but somehow we have been sold entire industries like the orthotics industry.

1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:28.160
 It's completely false. Meta analysis of the data shows that orthotics do nothing beyond

1:46:28.160 --> 1:46:33.040
 temporary relief from pain over a six, eight week period of time and provide no long term benefit.

1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:39.200
 And I can't tell you how many people I've eliminated back or knee or hip pain from working

1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:44.560
 on strengthening and controlling the foot and ankle complex. We believe we've villainized and

1:46:44.560 --> 1:46:53.200
 said a low arch is a condition that needs fixed. When it really is just controlling the foot and

1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:58.160
 ankle complex and how they relate to each other and how we use that, is it like go put on boxing

1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:03.200
 gloves in the morning and do that for the next 20 years and see what happens. It's not about finding

1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:09.360
 the right shoe that fits because your foot has been deformed. And so I'm not like some wacky

1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:13.600
 go like, oh, you got to be barefoot forever or do this. Like, no, I'm just saying, go spend some

1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:19.920
 time using it, strengthen it, learn to control it, and it will work better in a shoe. But the whole

1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:27.040
 running shoe movement with the raised heel, that was the person that suggested that to Nike way

1:47:27.040 --> 1:47:32.800
 back when they were trying to figure out what to do. The reason and he says it's the worst thing

1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:39.840
 that he ever did. Because we were coming from an era of people wearing heel shoes, which by the way

1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:44.240
 came from stirrups way back in the day, that's where the whole heel came from is to go into

1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:48.240
 stirrup, but then it went into fashion. And then the running craze started coming around in the 70s.

1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:53.040
 They're, they're starting to push this the general mass population and they realized that they were

1:47:53.040 --> 1:47:58.160
 causing injuries and like, what are we going to do? Well, that's because everybody was in this position

1:47:58.160 --> 1:48:01.920
 and had a shortened, shortened calf muscle. And it's like, well, to work around, let's just put

1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:09.040
 a heel on it so we don't injure them. That's it. And now, because the raised heel, you got to raise

1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:15.200
 the toe. And then now with that, if you go stand on something and pull your inner toe in, and in a

1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:19.680
 squat position, just reach down and do it, you'll see that you have no control over internal and

1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:25.920
 external rotation of your, of your leg, you don't, and or your foot and you actually have to put a

1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:34.320
 support in for the arch to be able to passively control those structures. It's just bandaid on

1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:38.480
 top of bandaid on top of bandaid. Use it, strengthen it. If you want to wear some shoes,

1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:41.840
 because they look good or fancy, I'm like, I have no problem. I mean, I go out on a wife,

1:48:41.840 --> 1:48:47.200
 my wife will put on some high heels every now and again. But all I'm saying is use your foot.

1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:52.080
 My thousand pound squat, my thousand pound deadlift were done barefoot. I'm not trying to

1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:58.160
 sell you shoes. Go do it with no shoe. That's what I've been promoting. I did that for six years,

1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:03.440
 and I promoted it. But people ask me like, well, what do I do because my gym requires shoes?

1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:10.640
 Okay, where do I go? And, and then I go, well, you know, you could pick up these other finger

1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:17.360
 shoes or whatever. And they go, man, my wife won't have sex with me. And I go, I know mine either,

1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:21.600
 like, trust me, I'm not making this up. Everybody in that market markets to one segment,

1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:25.760
 and they're still missing some gaps, because they, they still have a little bit too narrow

1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:29.280
 of a toe box. And if you're lifting, you have the opportunity to really get that splay and

1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:34.400
 start working on this stuff better. So I just wanted to create a shoe. These ones are odd

1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:38.960
 colored because it's a partnership with Kabuki. Normally we've got a black or a gray, low top,

1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:44.160
 high top sticks to the ground for lifting. So we can do that. And very pliable. It's a moccasin.

1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:49.520
 It's a modern day moccasin, but looks okay that you can wear it around in other areas if you,

1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:54.160
 if you so choose. Like, do you know what the number one healthcare cost in America is?

1:49:54.160 --> 1:50:03.760
 What's that? Diabetes, heart disease, cancer, low back pain.

1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:10.480
 What do you attribute a low back pain to? Well, it's attributed to a lot of things,

1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:16.960
 but inability to control spinal position, which starts happening from some breathing issues.

1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:22.560
 It also happens from the foot. So there's a lot of stuff, but everything that I do actually

1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:26.720
 focus on improving this. Yeah. So that, and it all starts with the foot.

1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:30.800
 This is one thing, like this doesn't affect breathing, but so it does actually affect

1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:35.840
 breathing to some actions and spinal stabilization. So the raised heel and toe will make you stride

1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:43.200
 further because of just how it operates, but that over stride is a result of opening this. So

1:50:43.200 --> 1:50:46.400
 we open the pelvis and diaphragm. Did we talk about that and the impact that that has for

1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:52.320
 controlling and spine? Yeah. I think we touched on that. But it's all this stuff plays together.

1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:56.800
 So the gait affects that. And so the shoe affects the gait and then so it's all connected.

1:50:56.800 --> 1:51:02.080
 All connected. Let me be very purposeful with some conversation here though. We've talked

1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:07.520
 about periodization. This was a big gap. So people go, yeah, well, when people started running with

1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:12.560
 those, they started having injuries back when the finger company produced those and didn't do the

1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:16.720
 education around this very simple concept. You do not walk into the gym if you haven't squatted and

1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:23.120
 start squatting 225 from, from Max Rex every week day or every day over day. And that's what people

1:51:23.120 --> 1:51:30.320
 did because they weren't told that you need to build the capacity to do this. You go wear these

1:51:30.320 --> 1:51:33.760
 and walk around in your office or wherever all day long, your feet are going to hurt.

1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:42.640
 They're going to be sore. Do it for 10% of your time. Yeah. Do that for a month, then add some.

1:51:42.640 --> 1:51:46.480
 That will build the capacity to do this. And then that's going to start having

1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:49.920
 the ability to strengthen, manage the foot. And there's a whole lot of other stuff. I've got videos

1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:55.040
 on things that you can do, buy whatever you want, or just, just spend some time out of them.

1:51:55.680 --> 1:52:00.240
 Like that's all that I want people to do because it is so simple and it has such a

1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:05.600
 profound impact. Yeah, it does. I, what I did, I noticed when you walked, when I walked in,

1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:08.720
 was like, Oh, hey, you're spending some time without the, without shoes on.

1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:15.920
 Well, what I did, I think it's already now two years ago and I was doing a lot of running,

1:52:15.920 --> 1:52:21.600
 I do like a 10 mile run, I would take my shoes off for the last like half mile and I run like

1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:28.480
 that. And that was for me really helpful to ensure that I have proper form, form that minimizes pain

1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:33.520
 on the way I run. I still like shoes. I benefit a lot from shoes, the protection they provide, but

1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:38.880
 it's for running we're referring to, especially trail running and so on.

1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:44.960
 And in the city, when there's glass and all those kinds of things, but it's really important to have

1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:52.640
 minimal sort of protection on your feet. For me, at least it was to figure out the ways that my form,

1:52:52.640 --> 1:52:58.240
 basic movement and like the positioning in the foot, the impact of the foot and everything,

1:52:58.240 --> 1:53:05.600
 you know, the lower leg, the entirety of the torso really, how it's improperly positioned

1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:12.480
 in terms for the objective of minimizing pain. And the barefoot running really helped fix that

1:53:12.480 --> 1:53:19.120
 for me, because I figured out that I need to take shorter steps, more frequent, you know,

1:53:19.120 --> 1:53:21.520
 all those kinds of things. And that really helps you figure that out.

1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:29.680
 Like, let's be realists about stuff. Like, spend some time using it, strengthen it. And I've got

1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:32.960
 some great ways to do that and learn how to do that. So, yeah.

1:53:32.960 --> 1:53:38.080
 What is a good diet for strength development? I've just to give you some context, I've been

1:53:38.080 --> 1:53:43.360
 eating mostly meat, not for strength, mostly for mental performance. I just enjoy it.

1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:50.400
 Yes, you need to have a base level of protein building blocks for tissue, right? We need to

1:53:50.400 --> 1:53:56.880
 have enough fats to be able to have hormones work and key processes in the body. We need to have,

1:53:57.600 --> 1:54:00.960
 well, you don't need to have, from a performance aspect, carbohydrates necessarily,

1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:05.280
 because the other ones can convert into injury sources. But for a performance athlete,

1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:13.760
 carbohydrates can be very beneficial as well. So, I look at it as you want, you need a base

1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:18.560
 level fats, you need a base level of proteins, and then you adjust the carbohydrate intake

1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:24.720
 based on the needs. I'm not anti carbohydrate by any means, because a lot of people, well,

1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:28.160
 they look at me now when they see like how lean I am, and they jump to a conclusion,

1:54:28.160 --> 1:54:31.040
 you must be keto, you must be carnivore, you must be whatever. And it's like,

1:54:32.160 --> 1:54:38.080
 so losing and gaining weight is simply eating less or eating more. I mean, it,

1:54:39.600 --> 1:54:45.040
 and we get so complicated. Oh, that my fat, they're like, what's your fasting window? If I'm,

1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:50.960
 if I'm doing fasting, it's just because it works with my environment. Sometimes I do it,

1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:56.800
 sometimes I don't. All that does is control how much calories that you take, big success with

1:54:56.800 --> 1:55:05.120
 keto and carnivore diets. It's hard to eat a lot and put on weight with those diets. Protein

1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:10.560
 actually has a thermogenic effect. And so you have to have a massive amount of fats if you have a

1:55:10.560 --> 1:55:16.000
 only meat diet, because you can literally starve to death. There's a, there's a show where they

1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:19.520
 put people out in the wilderness. And this guy, the one that won one of the ones I looked at,

1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:24.240
 they threw him weight like up in the past a lot, you know, out the way out there,

1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:28.560
 there was nothing, but he somehow got a caribou and killed it. And he still lost a pound a day

1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:35.280
 for 30 days with the caribou, because his fat was stolen by a, and he could eat all the meat he

1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:41.840
 wanted. And then he almost got pulled because his weight loss, right? But that isn't actually a

1:55:41.840 --> 1:55:46.640
 performance. So those type keto and carnivore are not performance diets. So they're not going to

1:55:47.440 --> 1:55:53.920
 be as effective at supplying the energy needs for high capacity training. So don't get me wrong,

1:55:53.920 --> 1:56:00.320
 you can do training, but like, you can be a successful like elite athlete with a, with a vegan

1:56:00.320 --> 1:56:07.760
 diet, but it's not as easy to do it with other diets. So on your missing some base nutrients,

1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:14.400
 so many nutrients and meat, I believe having greens in your diet is really beneficial,

1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:18.320
 lots of research, but there's people in the other worlds that argue that you don't need them, but

1:56:18.320 --> 1:56:24.640
 they help clear organs, provide micronutrients, all this sort of stuff. So I eat simply a whole

1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:31.360
 well rounded diet and I've gone from, I can go from 285 pounds, squatting a ton of weight

1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:36.240
 to eating less and dropping all the way down to, you know, seven, eight percent body fat with vein

1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:41.600
 standing out everywhere without a tissue on me, just with amazing, great tasting food.

1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:47.600
 To lose weight or be healthy does not mean that you need to eat flavorless, bland food.

1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:51.120
 So that's the main point I try to get across.

1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:56.000
 It's eat less to lose weight, eat more to gain weight. Yep. Make sure that you've got enough

1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:00.160
 protein, make sure that you've got your micronutrients covered, which is going to cover by eating real

1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:05.760
 food. Don't go low fat, no fat. If you want a performance, don't go no carb, but if it works

1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:12.800
 any of those things. So diet approach, when you look at diets, understand that they're,

1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:16.800
 how aggressive they are. So like keto can make you lose a lot of weight, carnivore can make you

1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:22.480
 lose a lot of weight. A lot of that upfront is actually dropping glycogen stores. So you're

1:57:22.480 --> 1:57:27.920
 actually just reducing water in your muscle and fat tissue, which is why it isn't as great for a

1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:34.960
 performance diet. But understand that every diet also has a level of discipline and does it fit

1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:41.360
 your lifestyle. So I suggest people don't find a diet. You need to find a lifestyle because

1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:49.360
 that's what's sustainable. I hate the word diet to begin with. What behaviors are sustainable?

1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:54.080
 And then do that. And then over time, the things you'll get to where you need to get.

1:57:55.120 --> 1:58:02.320
 Diet itself, just by the name of it, is not sustainable because it is a short term thing

1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:08.880
 to get somewhere. Yeah. I tend to try to measure it because I definitely have a love hate relationship

1:58:08.880 --> 1:58:16.400
 with food. I tend to look back and say, by following this particular protocol, lifestyle,

1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:24.800
 whatever, what was the level of happiness? Yes. So not weight loss or weight gain or all those

1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:28.880
 kinds of things. It's the entirety of the picture, productivity, just feeling good throughout the

1:58:28.880 --> 1:58:35.280
 day, socially also interacting with people because so much of human connection, like I

1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:40.240
 mentioned before, is over food. And if you're going to limit yourself in that regard, you're

1:58:40.240 --> 1:58:48.400
 limiting a certain fundamental aspect of life. A number of years ago, I did like 20 to 22 hour

1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:52.880
 fasts every day. And I'm like, well, this doesn't work. I can't do business lunches and stuff like

1:58:52.880 --> 1:58:57.360
 that. So when I was in my fasting thing, I went to a 16 so I could have a light lunch just for the

1:58:57.360 --> 1:59:04.320
 social aspect of it and perform a little perform that. And then that's why the typical bodybuilding,

1:59:04.320 --> 1:59:09.840
 like the eight meal a day diet has never worked for me because I've always been a very bit like

1:59:09.840 --> 1:59:14.720
 trying to fit that between meetings and other stuff. What that diet provides is it just,

1:59:14.720 --> 1:59:18.800
 do you get less bloat and distention of a larger meal? But at the end of the day,

1:59:18.800 --> 1:59:25.200
 you get the same exact results. Pick a lifestyle, live that you can have really great tasting food.

1:59:25.920 --> 1:59:30.880
 And that to me is the same thing. And this is why I'm like really hitting this point because

1:59:30.880 --> 1:59:35.120
 also with the dieting and like the approach like, oh, I'm going to do this and people pick

1:59:35.840 --> 1:59:43.040
 these chicken and broccoli recipes and guess what, you're going to break. If you do not enjoy it,

1:59:44.080 --> 1:59:54.480
 you will break. So it is a very important point. Well, I also slightly push back or maybe to

1:59:54.480 --> 2:00:02.640
 elaborate. If you don't enjoy moderation, for me, particularly, I have trouble moderating

2:00:02.640 --> 2:00:09.360
 certain things, most foods, I would say. So my source of happiness comes with foods,

2:00:09.360 --> 2:00:14.560
 even if they're bland, the ones that can enjoy but enjoy moderation. So there's,

2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:21.760
 I mean, I enjoy every piece of food. So it's like, if you can enjoy the full lifestyle,

2:00:21.760 --> 2:00:25.920
 it's not just the particular experience, but like the full journey.

2:00:25.920 --> 2:00:28.080
 Does it fit your lifestyle? Yeah.

2:00:29.200 --> 2:00:35.680
 So let me ask about a complicated topic that's sometimes a bit controversial,

2:00:35.680 --> 2:00:42.720
 which is steroids and maybe TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. What role does that play

2:00:42.720 --> 2:00:46.640
 in strength training? All right, we're going to go there.

2:00:46.640 --> 2:00:55.520
 Yeah, but it's an important discussion to have. I think that it's something that I can be more

2:00:55.520 --> 2:01:03.360
 transparent on. In my past, I wasn't able to do to the career that I had. So just covering that

2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:12.480
 stuff in a public forum when you're highly looked at being an executive for recruiting and other

2:01:12.480 --> 2:01:20.720
 stuff, like it was an area I had to just kind of pass on, right? Now, I've used steroids.

2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:31.440
 I've used them since I was 33. And I basically just used TRT now after my big squat. So for

2:01:31.440 --> 2:01:41.680
 10 years, I used them. And there's some interesting components to this. So one is just the gray area

2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:50.560
 of what we call performance enhancing supplements. So performance was a PEDs. That the line of what

2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:59.280
 defines a PED is ever shifting. And it's shifting based on society norms, cultural norms, government

2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:03.760
 bonding agencies, all these sorts of stuff. So I'm not making excuses here. So I just want to

2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:08.960
 elaborate before I actually start digging into the details here. Because performance enhancing,

2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:17.120
 I could take sodium bicarbonate and enhance my ability to perform deadlifts for reps. Guess

2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:21.920
 what? I did that for my Guinness World Record for deadlifts in a minute. People do it for rowing

2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:29.360
 or other, they use high capacity type stuff. It is performance enhancing. It is a chemical.

2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:38.480
 It is baking soda. All right? They're not able to make it illegal because everybody eats bread,

2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:45.040
 not everyone. And so it's a little hard to test for. No matter what you do at any level,

2:02:45.040 --> 2:02:51.280
 so that's an extreme example. But other examples, you're drinking an energy drink in that cup there

2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:56.880
 a little while ago. And in America, you can get an energy drink with 240 milligrams of caffeine

2:02:56.880 --> 2:03:03.280
 in it. In Canada, that's too dangerous. You can only get 140. But you can go buy a Fedra.

2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:09.520
 And a Fedra is illegal in America. And so these things bounce back and forth all the time.

2:03:10.240 --> 2:03:20.880
 I could take Yohembi. And in Europe or Australia, it is a drug and classified in America. It is not.

2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:26.320
 It's an herbal root and a lot high actually, one of my supplements except for the overseas

2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:31.600
 version. Anyway, the point I'm getting is no matter what you do at some point,

2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:41.760
 there's by someone's standards, you are cheating. And because it is, you're taking something that

2:03:42.640 --> 2:03:47.040
 but you could work around these things with nutritional ways or other ways versus taking

2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:50.480
 a chemical strip. And there's a whole lots of ways to do this. But it's like, oh, no,

2:03:50.480 --> 2:03:55.840
 it's steroids. It's not, it's injectable. It's not. Well, somewhere there's a culture or a person

2:03:55.840 --> 2:04:00.160
 that will say you're cheating no matter what. So it's a self defined, you need to define it

2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:04.560
 for yourself unless you're competing in an organization that has testing, then it's a

2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:11.200
 straight ethical thing. And it's either right or wrong, in my opinion. That's kind of the

2:04:11.200 --> 2:04:18.400
 overall dilemma of it is if you want to see what you're totally capable of, you have to decide

2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:27.200
 yourself what's okay or not to that level. There is no, there is no body that can say

2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:33.760
 something yes or no. Yeah, when there's an event like the Olympics, maybe then you have a standard

2:04:33.760 --> 2:04:39.200
 that you're all trying to adhere to. And then it makes sense to keep a certain like, to be within,

2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:45.120
 there's an ethical. There's not. So yeah, I'm not talking about that. I'm agreeing to compete in

2:04:45.120 --> 2:04:50.720
 this by these, by these rules. Yeah, but when you're trying to maximize your own performance,

2:04:50.720 --> 2:04:54.560
 whatever that journey is, whatever that goal is, that's a different story. And it's not,

2:04:54.560 --> 2:04:59.600
 it's not easy to figure that out. You go up, you're just like dancing around the subject,

2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:04.960
 whatever. Well, guess what? I've got, I've got a prescription for growth hormone and testosterone.

2:05:05.760 --> 2:05:10.800
 It's legal for me to take. And you know what, a lot of the people that are in front of the camera

2:05:10.800 --> 2:05:17.840
 in the media, politicians and news people and the people that are there saying the, the no drug stuff,

2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:23.120
 they're going to anti agent clinics to look better. And they have a prescription for growth

2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:29.840
 hormone and testosterone themselves. But in their eyes, it's okay. It is a prescription from their

2:05:29.840 --> 2:05:39.520
 doctor because they have the money to do it. So it's legal. And it's fine. If I is interesting

2:05:39.520 --> 2:05:47.120
 in Oregon, anybody and I don't know what other states over the age of 16 can without parents

2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:52.960
 permission, by the way, walk into a gender clinic and as a female and get a prescription for testosterone.

2:05:54.160 --> 2:06:02.960
 But as an athlete, if I've got low testosterone, I am so low, I've got depression, I can't have sex

2:06:02.960 --> 2:06:09.520
 with my wife. It's affecting my quality of life. I will have to fight tooth and nail to get testosterone

2:06:09.520 --> 2:06:13.360
 just as a prescription. And then I will get kicked out of my organization for competing.

2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:21.120
 Like, so you understand how gray this stuff gets. Do you think the stigma on testosterone

2:06:21.120 --> 2:06:26.400
 is the reason we're not having like a healthy conversation about when it's proper? Like,

2:06:26.400 --> 2:06:31.360
 what are the proper uses of testosterone in an athlete's life and just the regular human life?

2:06:31.360 --> 2:06:37.120
 Yeah, absolutely. And it's just, it's like anything. It's like I said, it is lines that

2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:42.000
 we pick and draw. Anytime you put that out there, people are going to have different opinions

2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:46.080
 of where those lines are. So now when it comes to strength, here's an interesting thing. In

2:06:46.080 --> 2:06:50.960
 powerlifting, there's tested federations and non tested federations. So we can literally look at

2:06:50.960 --> 2:06:57.680
 the statistical data and actually find out what do steroids do. And so it's pretty clear

2:06:57.680 --> 2:07:05.600
 that steroids provide about a 10% increase in strength on average over not. Now that does take

2:07:05.600 --> 2:07:10.240
 out the fact that steroids will put you in, allow you to put on more mass, so you'll go up a weight

2:07:10.240 --> 2:07:17.440
 class a lot of times. So as a whole, you could definitely lift more probably than the 10% over

2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:23.600
 time, right? And then we think about steroids as the ability to just put on muscle. And here's

2:07:23.600 --> 2:07:27.920
 where things get a little interesting, even with people that use steroids is not understanding

2:07:27.920 --> 2:07:33.440
 the neurological impacts that steroids have. Because you could take some steroids right now

2:07:34.160 --> 2:07:40.400
 and be stronger in 10 minutes. That's clearly not done anything from a physiology standpoint

2:07:40.400 --> 2:07:46.800
 to make you stronger. But we have tapped in neurologically to elicit those gains. And

2:07:46.800 --> 2:07:54.320
 there's a whole lot that happens neurologically. How much science is there in terms of all the

2:07:54.320 --> 2:08:00.480
 different ways you could take steroids, which kinds of steroids, the timing, the dose, all of

2:08:00.480 --> 2:08:06.800
 those things to develop the neurological, the physical, the skeletal. You've talked with

2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:15.520
 such depth about the science of strength building in terms of form, in terms of the equipment that

2:08:15.520 --> 2:08:24.080
 you use. It seems like a component, the use of steroids should be an equal level of scientific

2:08:24.080 --> 2:08:32.400
 rigor when applying them. It is. Now, the research is harder to get because of what it is. But there

2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:37.920
 is a lot of research that was done when they were legal. So they were legal up and through the,

2:08:37.920 --> 2:08:47.600
 through I think the mid 80s. And so a lot of the classical high benefit to low risk steroids were

2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:52.560
 studied. And then since then, there's a lot of designer steroids or new steroids that have come

2:08:52.560 --> 2:08:58.800
 up that don't have a lot of research around safety and risk and things of that nature. And we can't

2:08:58.800 --> 2:09:05.920
 do that because of the legality around these things. But some of the stuff on the neurological

2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:13.040
 function is really just understanding how that chemical structure works and what it's doing to

2:09:13.040 --> 2:09:21.200
 the neurotransmitters, what it's doing. And so some of it is really talking to people that have

2:09:21.200 --> 2:09:27.840
 experience with it. And the other is understanding those structures and what they do. The neurological

2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:35.440
 component, I think, is more interesting than most because the most steroids act through increasing

2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:40.880
 muscle protein synthesis. That's how you add more muscle is they have an anti catabolic effect.

2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:47.440
 And they have a muscle protein synthesis enhancing effect. So it reduces the amount of muscle that

2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:54.560
 you waste and increases the amount of muscle that you put on. But the neurological component

2:09:54.560 --> 2:10:01.760
 is tremendously valuable for what it can do for your training workout. Like if I handle more load

2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:06.960
 over time, I'm going to make more progress. If I can actually just stimulate more neurological

2:10:06.960 --> 2:10:12.720
 effects for a specific event, it's going to have an impact, right? But there's other ways that you

2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:17.760
 can tap into this too, things that you can tap into mentally with great practice with meditation

2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:23.520
 and other stuff that will have the same effect. People probably think I'm over speaking, especially

2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:28.160
 steroid users that are listening to this, okay, I'm talking out my ass, but I'm not.

2:10:28.160 --> 2:10:36.240
 Because I have experience with this stuff on both ends. And some of those areas, a lot of people

2:10:36.240 --> 2:10:43.680
 don't have the experience with that. What I've kind of heard from people is the confidence that

2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:49.760
 comes with steroids. It feels like, not to call it placebo, but it seems like the psychological

2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:57.680
 benefits of steroids is huge. And that you feel like there's a confidence that seems to be coupled

2:10:57.680 --> 2:11:03.520
 with the actual biological and chemical effects. I have actually a neurological condition. So I

2:11:03.520 --> 2:11:07.040
 actually don't feel a lot of that stuff that people, because there are certain steroids that

2:11:07.040 --> 2:11:15.280
 people will like, your very extreme ones that would make somebody bite someone's ear off in a

2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:22.160
 fight, for example. Yeah. Almost like aggression. And they'll literally do nothing. I'm always just

2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:29.520
 chilling. They don't like that effect. But neurologically, they're still having those

2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:35.440
 effects, but I don't get those feels that other people have from those. But yes, there's that

2:11:35.440 --> 2:11:40.880
 immediate boost in aggression and a confidence and stuff that come with a lot of those ones that deal

2:11:40.880 --> 2:11:46.080
 on the neurological. Overall, a good sense of well being just like from being on testosterone,

2:11:46.080 --> 2:11:52.160
 like it's going to affect your mood. And it's interesting. So testosterone replacement therapy,

2:11:52.160 --> 2:11:59.120
 if we walk down that path now and kind of switch gears, we find that men today have declining

2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:05.920
 testosterone over what has historically been in the past. So right now, I think a 35 year old

2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:14.640
 testosterone is shown to be about half what it was just 50 years ago. So I don't know if we could

2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:21.120
 argue the point, we don't really have the science to validate any of it. But it could be society as

2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:28.480
 far as the impact that it's having on the mental health. For men, it could be the the estrogens

2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:33.440
 floating around the water from all the chemicals and birth control and all this sort of stuff could

2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:40.480
 be a lot of things. But it is the fact that average testosterone is significantly lower.

2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:45.440
 And that is going to end up affecting life quality of life as well as your longevity,

2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:50.720
 because it will affect those things. But on the other end, steroids and TRT, particularly

2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:56.000
 steroids come with a lot of negative health benefits, not benefits, a lot of negative health

2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:02.160
 ramifications. And so, you know, if I knew what I know now, I don't know that I would have gone

2:13:02.160 --> 2:13:06.800
 that path. I didn't I didn't tell I was 33, which is kind of an outlier for a strength athlete.

2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:14.880
 I was I was a four times body weight deadlifter 800 plus pounds at 198. It's pretty dang strong

2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:21.440
 before I went down that path. And that's because I wanted to see what I was capable of. But I was

2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:25.600
 reaching a point that it was either I need to do that or not. My testosterone, my natural

2:13:25.600 --> 2:13:32.320
 testosterone levels were actually, I think below 300 is actually the threshold. So I was being told

2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:36.880
 to go on TRT for the last couple years, probably just because I was pushing so hard and the stress

2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:42.720
 level was driving my test down. So it was self imposed, more than likely. But I put it off because

2:13:42.720 --> 2:13:47.440
 I wanted to set all the drug free records. And I set the ones that I wanted. And then it was 33.

2:13:47.440 --> 2:13:52.960
 I'm, you know, entering the age category. And I'm like, I'm going to go on TRT. I did not feel

2:13:52.960 --> 2:13:58.480
 like I should be with TRT. Personally, my ethical standard was I shouldn't be competing in tested

2:13:58.480 --> 2:14:04.000
 events anymore. There are federations that will allow you with your, you show up with your script

2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:08.800
 and you do your test and you're below a certain level, but you're still on. But for me, I'm like,

2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:16.080
 that's not okay. So I'm like, I may as well at this point use steroids. But since then, you know,

2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:21.440
 understanding all those ramifications, you know, I might not have gone down that route quite so

2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:28.880
 fast and easily. But I continued because I also have a lot of resources that other people don't

2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:33.120
 in being able to assess and understand and put things in place to mitigate that. So you need to

2:14:33.120 --> 2:14:39.360
 be, and the other thing is once you go on, it's literally a decision for life. Not in this,

2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:46.320
 but realistically is because your, your quality of life, your feeling is going to be enhanced

2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:50.480
 quite a bit. And you're not going to want to go back. And if you go back, it's going to be less

2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:56.160
 than it was before. That's how the endocrine system works. There are ways to try to recover and

2:14:56.160 --> 2:15:00.400
 bring that up, but it might be a while. And if you've been on for a while, it definitely is not

2:15:00.400 --> 2:15:06.400
 an option. So those are big things that people need to understand that you're going to have some

2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:14.880
 things in there. And even TRT has some potential, especially at higher levels, that it's going to,

2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:20.560
 you know, increase the risk for prostate cancer. It's going to potentially cause some

2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:25.920
 hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the heart and some potential plaque buildup of some of

2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:30.480
 those key arteries around there that's going to have an impact on your cardiovascular health.

2:15:30.480 --> 2:15:35.040
 There's things that you can do again, but everything is like the shoe story, right? Where

2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:40.640
 I'm anti, anti shoe, but I'm going, well, we could put band aids on this. Yeah. So it's

2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:45.760
 there, but there's a quality of life that comes with it, the increase in quality of life. And

2:15:45.760 --> 2:15:50.480
 if you do it correctly, I think for me, for me, I definitely would not live without TRT,

2:15:50.480 --> 2:15:57.920
 even with knowing what I know now at this age and the quality of life and being able to be there,

2:15:57.920 --> 2:16:02.640
 have the energy, the recovery. That's a big thing. We're all this though. I talked about

2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:09.360
 muscle protein synthesis and anti catabolism as being big drivers, but recovery is the other big

2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:16.480
 aspect that they offer, probably as a result of those, but those are going to be the big

2:16:16.480 --> 2:16:23.440
 enhancement. So just doing steroids, steroids is going to increase all the other stuff that you

2:16:23.440 --> 2:16:28.240
 do. So if you have good training, you have good diet, good quality of sleep, like all this other

2:16:28.240 --> 2:16:33.200
 stuff, then you can take advantage of that, but you could choose steroids and nobody would know.

2:16:33.200 --> 2:16:41.040
 And honestly, you go down to 24 hour fitness and you'll see a bunch of late 19 to 21 year old

2:16:41.040 --> 2:16:47.600
 kids that are all kind of red and 150 pounds that don't look like anything. And a bunch of them

2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:55.200
 will be using steroids because they're not like, so it's not going to make a champion.

2:16:55.200 --> 2:16:57.920
 Like you said, 10% at most.

2:16:57.920 --> 2:17:01.120
 Guess what? I was already at an elite level. I was one of the best in the world

2:17:01.120 --> 2:17:09.280
 before I started using. It doesn't do that. It does a 10% increase at best. And that's proven

2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:14.400
 in the statistics, which is interesting because most people don't know this. The data is right

2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:26.000
 there. Yeah. And that's why I'm often saddened by maybe the negative view of somebody like

2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:31.280
 Lance Armstrong, who was one of the greatest athletes in history.

2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:35.840
 And everybody else that he was competing against, I'm sorry. I hate to blow anybody's

2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:41.040
 bubble, but regardless of I told you my ethical pieces with saying that you're going to be at

2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:47.440
 something at an elite level, you look at a lot of those big figures out there.

2:17:48.880 --> 2:17:52.880
 When their income in your life relies on it, you're going to push those limits.

2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:59.200
 So maybe my ethical would change if I was in that position too, because here's the thing

2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:06.080
 what I believe. Someone is, I think people should avoid steroids. TRT,

2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:11.920
 probably something worth taking a look at what your levels are when you're in the 35 to 45 range

2:18:11.920 --> 2:18:15.440
 and see what decision you decide to make from there. And that's a decision that you make for

2:18:15.440 --> 2:18:19.440
 the rest of your life. The only times that you should be taking a look at steroids is if it's

2:18:19.440 --> 2:18:26.800
 funding your life, it's creating that it is your job and it's doing, honestly, it was for me.

2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:36.880
 So was it the only thing? No. No. If you want to get into neurology, neurotransmitters and alcohol,

2:18:36.880 --> 2:18:40.880
 there's a really interesting discussion on performance enhancement. So when I lift heavy,

2:18:42.240 --> 2:18:46.320
 and so I always promote it, not more than a drink or two once or twice a month is what

2:18:46.320 --> 2:18:51.120
 all I'm talking about when I'm saying this. What's the timing of the drink that we're talking about?

2:18:51.120 --> 2:18:55.360
 It's about three to five minutes before. Yes. And then we're talking about beer.

2:18:56.160 --> 2:19:02.640
 It doesn't matter the source. So shots are the easiest. You want something that is not going

2:19:02.640 --> 2:19:07.840
 to have some sort of regurgitory effect or bloating effect or anything like that. But you

2:19:07.840 --> 2:19:12.800
 want to have the quick hit of energy. So it's a preferential energy source moves above ketones,

2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:17.760
 carbs, everything at seven calories per gram. But then there's some really interesting things

2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:22.320
 that happen. Spike's blood pressure, which is going to make weights feel lighter. So when you're

2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:27.920
 in your early 20s and you're trying to hit up some attractive person at the bar and you're with

2:19:27.920 --> 2:19:32.560
 your buddies and you're like, ah, you know, and you got second guess. Oh, should I? And they go,

2:19:33.520 --> 2:19:39.520
 have a shot of liquid courage. And you have one. And all of a sudden, the second thoughts,

2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:44.480
 the second guessing, all that drops away. Like you're focused in the moment. And you walk over

2:19:44.480 --> 2:19:48.160
 and you actually perform a little better, like conversation wise than you normally would. Now,

2:19:48.160 --> 2:19:51.120
 if you have five or six and then go over, you're going to make a fool of yourself. So it's all

2:19:51.120 --> 2:19:55.840
 about timing and amount. But there is a reason that that happens. So anyway, I'm known for

2:19:55.840 --> 2:20:00.880
 promoting this whiskey and deadlift concept. I love this. But it works like the Eastern Block.

2:20:01.680 --> 2:20:07.040
 That's where I stole it from because I was watching all these Russian lifters would have

2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:11.040
 a shot of vodka or something before they go lift. And I'm like, there's something here.

2:20:11.040 --> 2:20:15.840
 So I started experimenting with it. And I'm like, that works. And then I started researching,

2:20:15.840 --> 2:20:20.080
 nobody talks about this stuff. So it takes a while to start piecing together all the stuff that

2:20:20.080 --> 2:20:26.000
 actually happens to make that happen. But it moves away the things that you're going to,

2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:29.760
 the concerns about the ramifications in the future and the other stuff. So the,

2:20:30.480 --> 2:20:35.120
 but brings you into the moment. And then the dopamine hit and the other and then it

2:20:35.120 --> 2:20:43.440
 enhances whatever mood that you're in. But all of a sudden you get in the state much easier.

2:20:44.720 --> 2:20:48.880
 And so it's really, really interesting, but it's very, it's a very small amount needed

2:20:49.600 --> 2:20:55.680
 and very time sensitive, but it can be so much more powerful than like drugs people use

2:20:55.680 --> 2:21:00.400
 for this stuff. It ties really together with meditative state and other pieces to,

2:21:00.400 --> 2:21:06.880
 to get you into that flow state. Those thoughts about failure, what if, what if, like all that you,

2:21:06.880 --> 2:21:14.960
 you get into that zone, that moment, that time. So anyway, so interesting and alcoholic is promoting

2:21:14.960 --> 2:21:19.920
 out, you know, but there's an important point here, which not often talked about. I think it is

2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:25.760
 fascinating that because you can get into so much trouble with alcohol when you use an excess,

2:21:25.760 --> 2:21:32.160
 people don't often talk about the positive aspects of alcohol, even in your college years.

2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:37.200
 It had a, it had a lasting effect on who I am as a person.

2:21:37.200 --> 2:21:42.640
 I don't think people give enough credit to the positive aspect. See, you could have accomplished

2:21:42.640 --> 2:21:46.640
 a lot of those same things with a little more moderation, which I think people should talk

2:21:46.640 --> 2:21:53.040
 about more, which is like the way to open up a personality, like the flowering of the full

2:21:53.040 --> 2:21:58.240
 character and the weirdness and the, the, the, like the beauty of who you are as a human being

2:21:58.240 --> 2:22:01.680
 could be opened up with alcohol. And that's really interesting to think about.

2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:06.960
 You should try some podcast with a, with a shot and, and these, you know, actually,

2:22:08.240 --> 2:22:13.360
 I do this sometimes with myself and guests, and it will change the conversation and lubricates

2:22:13.360 --> 2:22:19.280
 this, the conversation. Definitely not the excess, which is what I learned because I went all the

2:22:19.280 --> 2:22:24.400
 way in because I do everything at extremes. So it was a really hard lesson that took me a lot

2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:31.200
 of time to unwind, but it is interesting and people don't discuss those things because it's

2:22:31.200 --> 2:22:37.360
 it's either this or this. You're one of the greatest strength athletes of all time. So it's

2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:44.080
 worthwhile to consider how you optimize the, the feats of strength that you reach for

2:22:44.080 --> 2:22:51.200
 with things like steroids. It makes perfect sense. And I think that was a, from my perspective,

2:22:51.200 --> 2:22:55.200
 I think it was probably the right decision. You've achieved something incredible that inspires

2:22:55.920 --> 2:23:00.880
 a huge number of people. That's it. And you've shown to yourself and to the world,

2:23:01.440 --> 2:23:04.480
 but what the human body can accomplish. Yep. That's incredible.

2:23:04.480 --> 2:23:10.160
 And no matter if I pushed to a less weight and if I disclosed everything that I did,

2:23:10.160 --> 2:23:15.120
 and I didn't, you know, I wasn't using steroids in my opinion, if we went through everything,

2:23:15.120 --> 2:23:19.760
 there were people that would say, you're using performance enhancing. No matter, like it is,

2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:23.360
 it's straight up. So you just need to be okay with it yourself. And so I had to make the call.

2:23:23.360 --> 2:23:29.680
 I want to see what the true potential is of ever, let's throw everything out the window

2:23:29.680 --> 2:23:34.080
 that I feel, unless I feel it's a risk from a, from a health standpoint that I'm not willing to

2:23:34.080 --> 2:23:41.200
 take on. And because that's how do I, like, it's just picking and choosing. Yeah. And it's just

2:23:41.200 --> 2:23:45.360
 picking and choosing. I, here's what I want to know. This is what I want to be able to try to

2:23:45.360 --> 2:23:51.040
 achieve. And so, yeah, yeah, that's what I did. And, and what you did is incredible. Like, it's,

2:23:51.040 --> 2:23:56.880
 it's just all inspired. And what Sean did was incredible. Yeah. And that, and that aids me up.

2:23:56.880 --> 2:24:01.200
 And what's funny is the people that Basham are like on the media or politicians or maybe some

2:24:01.200 --> 2:24:07.760
 actors, and guess what? A ton of them are doing the same thing. It's hypocrisy at its finest,

2:24:07.760 --> 2:24:12.240
 trust me. But how many, how many of those figures you're watching in movies that love to talk,

2:24:13.040 --> 2:24:18.000
 you know, be, you know, be political and do this and the news and all this, I'm telling you,

2:24:18.720 --> 2:24:26.560
 they're, they're anti aging clinics, like all over California and everywhere else. Who do you

2:24:26.560 --> 2:24:31.360
 think is keeps them in business? Well, it's not a competitive lifter. I'll tell you that. Well,

2:24:31.360 --> 2:24:36.400
 that's you're using peptides and also in Psalms and all sorts of like,

2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:42.080
 you're speaking to the hypocrisy. I also want to speak to the, the fact, you know,

2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:45.120
 somebody's a friend of mine, David Goggins. I don't know if you know what that is,

2:24:45.120 --> 2:24:50.800
 ultramarathon runner, Navy seal. He gets pretty incredible person. Yeah. Incredible human being.

2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:56.960
 And he gets criticism like, you know, what you're doing is, um, is bad for the body, you know,

2:24:56.960 --> 2:25:04.400
 you're, you're pushing yourself too far. I find that the people that criticize are often people

2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:10.080
 that haven't truly pushed themselves to the limit. They haven't actually worked hard in their life.

2:25:10.960 --> 2:25:18.640
 When you work hard, you realize how incredible it is that a human being can dedicate themselves so

2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:26.160
 fully to an effort. The way you did, the way David Goggins does, the way, the way the greatest

2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:32.880
 athletes do. And there's nothing that should be said beyond just sitting back in awe, that humans

2:25:32.880 --> 2:25:39.040
 can achieve that. And that inspires me to do the best, whatever the hell I do, to be the best

2:25:39.040 --> 2:25:45.120
 version of that. There's something about like athletic feats, especially like strength, that

2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:52.560
 just inspire us to do the best, to be the best version of ourselves. I don't know. And that's

2:25:52.560 --> 2:25:59.520
 the only thing you should be saying as opposed to criticizing some little detail of this and that.

2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:04.080
 It's just awe inspiring that you push yourself to the limit. That's been talked to anybody that

2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:08.400
 is at that level. And this is funny, like in competitive sports, like you go online and people

2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:14.240
 it's just bash, bash, bash, bash, bash, bash, bash. You go talk to anybody, anybody, anybody

2:26:14.240 --> 2:26:18.880
 that's a high level athlete within that field. And nobody has a single bad thing to say about

2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:24.640
 each other. But all this chitter chatter down there. I mean, I know exactly what you're saying.

2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:30.480
 Yeah. So if you, I would say, because I have love for all those folks, especially when you're

2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:37.280
 younger, you have a little bit of that desire to criticize others. Like, I think that should be

2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:43.520
 channeled in improving your own life. Anytime that you feel that way, that is when you need to

2:26:43.520 --> 2:26:52.240
 turn inward. And it's hard to do. But there is a reason that you have those emotions around someone

2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:58.080
 else and what they're doing, that you have an opportunity to look at yourself and know why you

2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:03.280
 feel that way. And that, guess what, that's going to be the hard thing to do. That's going to be the

2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:08.880
 thing, again, that's stirring you a little bit, because it's so much easier to sit there and

2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:15.120
 or talk to your confidant or whatever, instead of go, why does that bother me? Yeah. Why does what

2:27:15.120 --> 2:27:23.040
 that person doing or what that person's achieving bother me? It's a good difficult question that I

2:27:23.760 --> 2:27:32.400
 often ask others whether it's better to work hard or work smart. I like to ask that question

2:27:32.400 --> 2:27:40.960
 because it helps me get a sense of the human being. And I think I, let me just say, I often,

2:27:43.680 --> 2:27:46.400
 I often like people that answer that would work hard.

2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:55.680
 Even though the quote unquote right answer is work smart, meaning like finding the optimal,

2:27:55.680 --> 2:28:02.480
 efficient way to achieve a certain goal. I find that people that answer work smart,

2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:09.760
 don't actually find the optimal, efficient way to achieve a goal. It seems like the people that,

2:28:09.760 --> 2:28:16.960
 at least as certainly early in life, strive to work their ass off, even that means doing the

2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:23.360
 inefficient, the dumb thing, just to learn the mistake, the spirit behind the human spirit

2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:30.160
 behind the person that says work hard is the one I connect with. But I'm torn, especially in the

2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:37.200
 war culture in the tech sector where people answer work smart. What would you say about

2:28:37.200 --> 2:28:43.520
 that tension? This definitely encompasses like, I'm the intellectual and I'm the meathead.

2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:50.240
 I'm the work around the clock and go fix the processes and make it so much better

2:28:50.240 --> 2:28:55.360
 in there, type person, right? That's me in a whole, that's everything, that's my life story,

2:28:55.360 --> 2:28:58.640
 right? Busting your ass to find the easiest way possible.

2:28:59.360 --> 2:28:59.920
 To both.

2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:12.000
 So like, I will build a custom hydraulic cart that will lift my plates up to the height of my

2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:18.240
 squat so that I can minimize, I roll it over next to it and then minimize the effort of it going

2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:26.640
 on and off to be able to lift the most amount of weight as possible so that I can save the energy

2:29:26.640 --> 2:29:32.960
 from here, from lifting those up in the fatigue of my back being in bad position so I can nearly

2:29:32.960 --> 2:29:43.120
 kill myself over here, right? My wife, anybody will say, I'm a workaholic. And the first thing

2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:49.280
 that I would do when I would be doing a company turnaround, they'd hire me come in and I would

2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:54.720
 be taking over for someone that wasn't successful, but it was usually hardly ever for lack of want

2:29:54.720 --> 2:29:58.880
 or trying. So a lot of times they knew they were unsuccessful and they were running around

2:29:58.880 --> 2:30:04.880
 working six, seven days a week, 12 hour days, doing so much. And it'd be like, well, you need to do

2:30:04.880 --> 2:30:09.680
 this and they train me on like, all the reports and this and all the things and like, good luck.

2:30:09.680 --> 2:30:18.880
 Good luck. I couldn't do it. And the first thing I would do is nothing. I would do nothing

2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:28.880
 because then I would find what actually keeps coming back, the things that I need to do and

2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:36.240
 how much of it was filling the space because so much of human nature when you're failing is to

2:30:36.240 --> 2:30:42.160
 make yourself feel like you're accomplishing things. This is when things go on your checklist

2:30:42.160 --> 2:30:47.760
 and you start rolling up. So you're running around, just getting shit done. Yeah, yeah,

2:30:47.760 --> 2:30:56.320
 being busy. Right? And so, but at the same time, find somewhere in my career, something I've done

2:30:57.040 --> 2:31:02.240
 where I haven't outworked everybody. Just so much on distilling things down to what's important.

2:31:02.240 --> 2:31:14.160
 Yeah. And you've got to make time to sit back and assess and think and be introspective.

2:31:14.160 --> 2:31:20.640
 You have to make time for this because if not, you're going to waste so much time sitting there,

2:31:21.520 --> 2:31:28.640
 walking sideways when all you got to do is move just one step in front of the other each day,

2:31:28.640 --> 2:31:36.000
 just one. That's all I say because it's going to add up, but you could spend six months

2:31:36.560 --> 2:31:42.800
 knocking shit out, doing your routine, busting your ass and not take that one step.

2:31:44.320 --> 2:31:49.920
 So you've got to distill stuff down. You've got to really understand what's important to you in

2:31:49.920 --> 2:31:55.280
 life and where you're going. And when you're looking at anything in your life, the first thing

2:31:55.280 --> 2:32:02.320
 that you need to do is figure out, do I need to do it and just quit doing it? Just quit doing

2:32:02.320 --> 2:32:08.320
 things in your life. And you'll see that a lot of stuff that you think has to be done,

2:32:08.320 --> 2:32:15.200
 doesn't have to be done. You'd be surprised. And then from there is the tech, okay.

2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:23.040
 And then of that, what can I automate? What can I not have to do in a repeated fashion?

2:32:23.040 --> 2:32:28.240
 And then the last one, yeah, wherever possible, if it's not something that I'm adding tremendous

2:32:28.240 --> 2:32:33.200
 value to, like my uniqueness, people are like, oh, you must do the auto work on your vehicles

2:32:33.200 --> 2:32:36.960
 because you love working. I'm like, fuck that. I don't. They're like, what? That doesn't make

2:32:36.960 --> 2:32:42.960
 any sense. And I'm like, no, I love creating things. But I don't want to do that stuff.

2:32:44.480 --> 2:32:50.640
 So you could use delegating if you're a manager position, but it's outsourcing whatever it is.

2:32:50.640 --> 2:32:57.440
 But there are also so many things, and this ties back to your point around just doing it.

2:32:57.440 --> 2:33:04.240
 There's a point to experiencing all levels to really understand things. You need to spend time

2:33:04.240 --> 2:33:09.520
 at the same time doing all those things because there could be good, huge, massive gaps in there

2:33:10.480 --> 2:33:16.240
 that you're not aware of that are key for you or key to be having done different or so on.

2:33:16.240 --> 2:33:25.280
 So like in my company days, I was one of the few executives that came in that could do anything on

2:33:25.280 --> 2:33:35.200
 the floor from code to machine, run a lay the mill, weld, do all step into engineering. And that

2:33:35.200 --> 2:33:42.320
 added tremendous value to me to having had spent time being a doer and not enough people want to

2:33:42.320 --> 2:33:47.680
 be you've got to just go do shit. You need to spend time in your life chopping wood.

2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:52.400
 Yeah, get a lot of shit done doesn't matter. You got to have experience trying and doing

2:33:53.120 --> 2:33:59.520
 all these things that you would never like. My skill set is massive because I want to know like

2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:05.120
 you need to have those touchpoints. My job, my title is chief visionary.

2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:15.440
 But I've spent time doing everything. It's not about just like creating this amazing strategy

2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:18.720
 or vision and I'm just going to be there and this person that directs and like,

2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:27.280
 you can't be effective. You cannot connect the dots unless you've been in the moment with everything.

2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:33.520
 Yeah, low level stuff. Sometimes it's doing stupid shit that you're not uniquely qualified

2:34:33.520 --> 2:34:36.160
 to do that anywhere you could do, but you did it anyway.

2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:41.200
 Just the training environment. People hit me up at a school or wherever like,

2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:45.920
 hey, how do I get into I want to grow my grow my brand online. I want to do this,

2:34:45.920 --> 2:34:52.320
 like where do I where do I start? I'm like, go get a job at Planet Fitness or 24 hour fitness.

2:34:52.320 --> 2:34:56.800
 They're like, but I want to, you know, how do I get, you know, recognized and write articles and

2:34:56.800 --> 2:35:03.920
 be an online coach. I'm like, you need to go spend a few years one on one training people

2:35:04.720 --> 2:35:09.520
 to learn like the interaction, how people were, there's base levels you have to do.

2:35:09.520 --> 2:35:15.280
 You've got to go work your way up from the ground. I truly believe it.

2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:21.200
 Well, I think that's the hard work piece that I'm speaking to that I like it when people have been

2:35:21.200 --> 2:35:29.040
 humbled by the hardness of life. Like how difficult it is to do stuff. I went and got my MBA.

2:35:29.040 --> 2:35:35.120
 I went to MIT. I don't need to do that stuff. I'm above that. Yeah. Yeah. That's once you've been

2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:42.400
 humbled by doing those things, I feel like you can truly explore the optimization that you're

2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:47.680
 talking to finding the ways where you're uniquely capable to add value to the world.

2:35:47.680 --> 2:35:53.120
 And then, and then again, work your ass off to be the best in the world at that thing.

2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:58.720
 Yes. But then don't waste your time on shit that's not a line. Yeah. That's the only,

2:35:58.720 --> 2:36:04.480
 so that's, I guess there's a lot of context I put around that. But yeah, that was like a long

2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:11.600
 answer to a long, beautiful answer to an unanswerable question. Do you have advice

2:36:11.600 --> 2:36:16.400
 outside of all this discussion to young people today about career, about life? Since you've done

2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:23.040
 so many things, you've overcome a lot of things. Think high school, college student. Think about

2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:30.720
 what to do in their life. Do you have advice for those guys and girls? Yeah. Yeah. First is,

2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:38.640
 you don't have it figured out. So don't worry. Just jump in. Yeah. We talked a lot about

2:36:38.640 --> 2:36:44.640
 understanding your values and aligning all that stuff, but you got to have a base level of

2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:53.920
 start exploring and learning and just spending the time doing like pick something. Let me elaborate

2:36:53.920 --> 2:36:57.840
 a little bit. No, you know what? A lot of people struggle with that aspect now because the choice,

2:36:57.840 --> 2:37:01.760
 there's so much choice is difficult to pick something, but I think it does blow down to,

2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:06.400
 you should pick something and don't worry about it. And then, but within that, you can start

2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:12.960
 discovering the things that are there for you. Like I talked about, I made this huge shift,

2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:20.480
 I threw away all my life, but I don't regret anything about that. I wouldn't be where I was

2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:25.440
 if I didn't walk through and learn those things. And in fact, in the course of that, I learned

2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:34.320
 just how much that inspiring people and helping them realize the potential far beyond what they

2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:40.480
 thought was capable. And guess what? That was leadership 101 in managing people base level,

2:37:40.480 --> 2:37:45.840
 floor level, right? And I got a lot out that was perfectly aligned with what, and that's what I

2:37:45.840 --> 2:37:54.160
 realized it didn't matter what industry I was in or any of those other things. But I was able,

2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:59.920
 you can see so many things, there's so many paths that you can go down to help you realize what those

2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:06.480
 things are. And you're going to be able to find a lot of those nuggets and develop those. Do you

2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:15.440
 think that I could have just gone to school and got out and started a globally recognized brand

2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:23.920
 within a few years without having been schooled in business while getting paid for it by others

2:38:23.920 --> 2:38:28.160
 for years? And in fact, that entire time, I knew that that's what I wanted to do,

2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:34.160
 but I didn't go out on it. I mentored some of my friends along the same path to go,

2:38:34.160 --> 2:38:38.080
 no, they're like, I'm ready. I'm ready to go do this. And I'm like, no, now you need to go get

2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:43.600
 a job. Yeah, you know engineering management design, all that stuff. Go get a job as a manager

2:38:43.600 --> 2:38:47.200
 now. Like, oh, that's a step down. I can't do that. I'm like, go try it. A couple years later,

2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:51.440
 oh my God, that was such a good move. I didn't know what I didn't know. And now they're an

2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:57.120
 executive for freaking a Fortune 500 company. And the same thing, like I sat there knowing

2:38:57.120 --> 2:39:02.560
 that I was getting a free education. Don't stress yourself out as my, that's my advice.

2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:08.560
 Don't stress yourself out that you've got to have this perfect thing. Because this process

2:39:08.560 --> 2:39:14.080
 of understanding your values and the interest, that takes time. You can get a job where you're

2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:19.440
 getting paid to learn. Exactly. That's a good deal before you launch on your own.

2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:26.000
 You mentioned going back to darkness. I'm Russian, so I like going back to darkness.

2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:32.800
 Yes. He suffers from depression. You consider suicide. Do you all ponder your own death these

2:39:32.800 --> 2:39:39.760
 days? Do you think about your mortality? Are you afraid of death? I definitely think about

2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:48.240
 mortality. And am I afraid of my own death? It depends on the moment. If I'm in the middle

2:39:48.240 --> 2:39:57.520
 of a project, I definitely want to finish that project, man. But I don't fear it so much. I

2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:10.480
 fear leaving my kids or my wife and not being able to be there for them. That bothers me.

2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:20.160
 Outside of that, I know that I put everything into the life that I've lived. Like you said,

2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:29.520
 there's always more, but I've lived hard. I've loved hard. Every moment in my life,

2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:37.440
 I've made connections and impacted people around me for the better. And this tracks back, which is

2:40:37.440 --> 2:40:41.360
 crazy when we were doing the documentary and they're interviewing people through my whole life

2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:48.240
 and the consistency of the themes of anyone. Anything for Duffin. Sure, I'll fly in from

2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:57.920
 Boston. It was crazy. Everybody had a story about me giving just over and over and I didn't even

2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:08.080
 really... It's just the way you were. I've been all in. I have a lot more I want to do, but I don't

2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:17.200
 have things that regret have not done in... I don't fear it. I don't fear it. Yeah, it's like the...

2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:21.600
 I don't know if you know the Bukowski poem, Go All The Way. Otherwise, don't even try.

2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:28.240
 It seems like you embody that poem and you've accomplished some incredible things

2:41:28.240 --> 2:41:33.040
 and serve as an inspiration to a huge number of people. Chris, you're an amazing human being.

2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:37.920
 I'm really honored that you would spend your valuable time with me. Thank you so much for

2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:41.840
 talking with me today. It was incredible. I can't wait to check out all the cool stuff

2:41:41.840 --> 2:41:48.160
 you've engineered with Kabuki Strength. So obviously, I love the... I love strength. I love

2:41:48.160 --> 2:41:54.400
 strength training. I love the idea of strength. I love the equipment and the engineering

2:41:54.400 --> 2:41:59.440
 approach that you take to strength. You're an incredible human, both on the things you've

2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:06.640
 accomplished in terms of your own strength feats and the kind of science and engineering you bring

2:42:06.640 --> 2:42:11.840
 to the field that many others could use. So thank you so much for talking today.

2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:18.480
 Thanks for having me on. That was quite the final thing. Thank you.

2:42:18.480 --> 2:42:23.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Chris Duffin and thank you to Headspace,

2:42:23.280 --> 2:42:29.280
 Magic Spoon, Sunbasket, and Ladder. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:42:30.080 --> 2:42:33.360
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Arnold Schwarzenegger.

2:42:34.240 --> 2:42:39.760
 Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go

2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:45.840
 through hardship and decide not to surrender, that is strength. Thank you for listening

2:42:45.840 --> 2:43:11.120
 and hope to see you next time.
