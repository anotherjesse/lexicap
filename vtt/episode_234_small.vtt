00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
 The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram, his third time on the podcast.

00:04.880 --> 00:10.240
 He's a computer scientist, mathematician, theoretical physicist, and the founder of

00:10.240 --> 00:15.920
 Wolfram Research, a company behind Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language,

00:15.920 --> 00:22.160
 and the new Wolfram Physics Project. This conversation is a wild, technical roller coaster

00:22.160 --> 00:28.480
 ride through topics of complexity, mathematics, physics, computing, and consciousness. I think

00:28.480 --> 00:35.280
 this is what this podcast is becoming, a wild ride. Some episodes are about physics, some about

00:35.280 --> 00:41.840
 robots, some are about war and power, some are about the human condition and our search for meaning,

00:41.840 --> 00:49.680
 and some are just what the comedian Tim Dillon calls fun. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:49.680 --> 00:54.880
 To support it, please check out the sponsors in the description. And now here's my conversation

00:54.880 --> 01:01.600
 with Stephen Wolfram. Almost 20 years ago, you published a new kind of science,

01:01.600 --> 01:07.440
 where you presented a study of complexity and an approach for modeling of complex systems.

01:07.440 --> 01:14.800
 So let us return again to the core idea of complexity. What is complexity?

01:15.360 --> 01:18.720
 I don't know. I think that's not the most interesting question. It's like,

01:18.720 --> 01:24.480
 if you ask a biologist, what is life? That's not the question they care the most about.

01:25.520 --> 01:32.160
 What I was interested in is how does something that we would usually identify as complexity

01:32.160 --> 01:36.720
 arise in nature? And I got interested in that question 50 years ago, which is really embarrassingly

01:36.720 --> 01:44.480
 a long time ago. How does snowflakes get to have complicated forms? How do galaxies get to have

01:44.480 --> 01:50.400
 complicated shapes? How do living systems get produced? Things like that. And the question is,

01:50.400 --> 01:56.960
 what's the underlying scientific basis for those kinds of things? And the thing that I was at first

01:56.960 --> 02:01.120
 very surprised by, because I've been doing physics and particle physics and fancy mathematical

02:01.120 --> 02:06.320
 physics and so on, and it's like, I know all this fancy stuff. I should be able to solve this basic

02:06.320 --> 02:14.800
 science question. And I couldn't. This was like early maybe 1980ish time frame. And it's like, okay,

02:14.800 --> 02:19.440
 what can one do to understand the sort of basic secret that nature seems to have? Because it

02:19.440 --> 02:24.320
 seems like nature, you look around in the natural world, it's full of incredibly complicated forms.

02:24.320 --> 02:29.760
 You look at sort of most engineered kinds of things. For instance, they tend to be, you know,

02:29.760 --> 02:35.600
 we've got sort of circles and lines and things like this. And the question is, what secret does

02:35.600 --> 02:41.040
 nature have that lets it make all this complexity that we in doing engineering, for example,

02:41.040 --> 02:45.760
 don't naturally seem to have? And so that was the kind of the thing that I got interested in.

02:45.760 --> 02:50.640
 And then the question was, could I understand that with things like mathematical physics? Well,

02:50.640 --> 02:55.440
 it didn't work very well. So then I got to thinking about, okay, is there some other way to try to

02:55.440 --> 03:00.160
 understand this? And then the question was, if you're going to look at some system in nature,

03:00.160 --> 03:04.880
 how do you make a model for that system, for what that system does? So a model is some abstract

03:04.880 --> 03:09.920
 representation of the system, some formal representation of the system. What is the

03:09.920 --> 03:15.840
 raw material that you can make that model out of? And so what I realized was, well, actually,

03:15.840 --> 03:21.200
 programs are really good source of raw material for making models of things. And, you know,

03:21.200 --> 03:26.800
 in terms of my personal history, to me, that seemed really obvious. And the reason it seemed

03:26.800 --> 03:31.120
 really obvious is because I just spent several years building this big piece of software that

03:31.120 --> 03:35.600
 was sort of a predecessor to mathematical and morphine language, then called SMP, symbolic

03:35.600 --> 03:42.320
 manipulation program, which was something that had this idea of starting from just these computational

03:42.320 --> 03:46.800
 primitives and building up everything one had to build up. And so kind of the notion of, well,

03:46.800 --> 03:50.560
 let's just try and make models by starting from computational primitives and seeing what we can

03:50.560 --> 03:56.800
 build up. That seemed like a totally obvious thing to do. In retrospect, it might not have been

03:56.800 --> 04:00.880
 externally quite so obvious, but it was obvious to me at the time, given the path that I happened

04:00.880 --> 04:06.480
 to have been on. So, you know, so that got me into this question of, let's use programs to model

04:06.480 --> 04:11.680
 what happens in nature. And the question then is, well, what kind of programs? And, you know,

04:11.680 --> 04:15.680
 we're used to programs that you write for some particular purpose, and it's a big long piece

04:15.680 --> 04:21.760
 of code, and it does some specific thing. But what I got interested in was, okay, if you just go out

04:21.760 --> 04:26.080
 into the sort of computational universe of possible programs, you say, take the simplest

04:26.080 --> 04:31.280
 program you can imagine, what does it do? And so I started studying these things called cellular

04:31.280 --> 04:35.680
 automata. Actually, I didn't know at first they were called cellular automata, but I found that out

04:36.320 --> 04:40.640
 subsequently. But it's just a line of cells, you know, each one is black or white. And it's just

04:40.640 --> 04:45.280
 some rule that says the color of the cell is determined by the color that it had on the previous

04:45.280 --> 04:51.520
 step. And it's two neighbors on the previous step. And I had initially thought that's, you know,

04:51.520 --> 04:55.600
 sufficiently simple setup is not going to do anything interesting. It's always going to be

04:55.600 --> 05:00.880
 simple, no complexity, simple rule, simple behavior. Okay, but then I actually ran the

05:00.880 --> 05:05.280
 computer experiment, which is pretty easy to do. I mean, it probably took a few hours

05:06.080 --> 05:12.400
 originally. And the results were not what I'd expected at all. Now, needless to say,

05:12.400 --> 05:17.040
 in the way that science actually works, the results that I got a lot of unexpected things,

05:17.040 --> 05:21.600
 which I thought were really interesting, but the really strongest result, which was already right

05:21.600 --> 05:26.160
 there in the printouts I made, I didn't really understand for a couple more years. So it was,

05:26.160 --> 05:31.280
 it was not, you know, the compressed version of the story is you run the experiment and you

05:31.280 --> 05:37.040
 immediately see what's going on. But I wasn't smart enough to do that, so to speak. But the big,

05:37.040 --> 05:43.520
 the big thing is, even with very simple rules of that type, sort of the minimal, tiniest program,

05:43.520 --> 05:49.120
 sort of the, the one line program or something, it's possible to get very complicated behavior.

05:49.120 --> 05:54.000
 My, my favorite example is the single rule 30, which is a particular cellular automaton rule,

05:54.000 --> 05:58.240
 you just started off in one black cell, and it makes this really complicated pattern.

05:58.880 --> 06:06.960
 And so that, for me, was sort of a critical discovery that then kind of said, playing back

06:06.960 --> 06:12.320
 onto, you know, how does nature make complexity? I sort of realized that might be how it does it.

06:12.320 --> 06:16.400
 That might be kind of the secret that it's using is that in this kind of computational

06:16.400 --> 06:20.960
 universe of possible programs, it's actually pretty easy to get programs where even though

06:20.960 --> 06:26.240
 the program is simple, the behavior when you run the program is not simple at all. And that was,

06:26.240 --> 06:32.400
 so for me, that was the, the kind of the, the story of kind of how that, that was sort of the,

06:32.400 --> 06:36.720
 the indication that one had got an idea of what the sort of secret that nature uses

06:36.720 --> 06:40.800
 to make complexity and the complexity, how complexity can be made in other places.

06:40.800 --> 06:48.720
 Now, if you say, what is complexity, you know, it's, it's complexity is, it's not easy to tell

06:48.720 --> 06:53.280
 what's going on. That's the informal version of what is complexity.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.960
 But there is something going on, but there's a rule to know what, right?

06:56.960 --> 07:01.040
 Well, no, the rules can generate just randomness, right?

07:01.600 --> 07:06.240
 Well, that's not obvious. In other words, that's not obvious at all.

07:06.240 --> 07:11.680
 And it wasn't what I expected. It's not what people's intuition had been and has been for,

07:11.680 --> 07:17.200
 you know, for a long time. That is one might think you have a rule, you can tell there's a

07:17.200 --> 07:22.400
 rule behind it. I mean, it's just like, you know, the early, you know, robots in science fiction

07:22.400 --> 07:28.800
 movies, right? You can tell it's a robot cause it does simple things, right? Turns out that isn't

07:28.800 --> 07:33.280
 actually the right story. But it's not obvious that isn't the right story, because people assume

07:33.280 --> 07:38.560
 simple rules, simple behavior. And that the sort of the key discovery about the computational

07:38.560 --> 07:44.880
 universe is that isn't true. And that discovery goes very deep and relates to all kinds of things

07:44.880 --> 07:50.640
 that I've spent years and years studying. But, you know, that in the end, the sort of the,

07:50.640 --> 07:55.840
 the what is complexity is, well, you can't easily tell what it's going to do. You could just run the

07:55.840 --> 08:01.520
 rule and see what happens. But you can't just say, Oh, you know, show me the rule. Great.

08:01.520 --> 08:06.080
 And now I know what's going to happen. And, you know, the key phenomenon around that is this thing

08:06.080 --> 08:12.640
 I call computational irreducibility, this fact that in something like rule 30, you might say,

08:12.640 --> 08:17.520
 well, what's it going to do after a million steps? Well, you can run it for a million steps and just

08:17.520 --> 08:22.960
 do what it does to find out. But you can't compress that you can't reduce that and say,

08:22.960 --> 08:26.480
 I'm going to be able to jump ahead and say, this is what it's going to do after a million steps,

08:26.480 --> 08:29.360
 but I don't have to go through anything like that computational effort.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.440
 By the way, has anybody succeeded at that? You had a challenge, a competition.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.080
 Right.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.560
 For predicting the middle column of rule 30.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.200
 Indeed.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.240
 Anybody.

08:38.240 --> 08:42.720
 A number of people have sent things in and sort of people are picking away at it, but it's hard.

08:42.720 --> 08:50.160
 I mean, it's, I've been, I've been actually even proving that the center column of rule 30

08:50.160 --> 08:54.480
 doesn't repeat. That's something I think might be doable. Okay.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.760
 Mathematically proving.

08:55.760 --> 09:00.960
 Yes. And so that's analogous to a similar kind of things like the digits of Pi,

09:00.960 --> 09:06.000
 which are also generated in this very deterministic way. And so a question is how random are the

09:06.000 --> 09:10.560
 digits of Pi? For example, does every, first of all, does the digits of Pi ever repeat?

09:10.560 --> 09:15.600
 Well, we know they don't because it was proved in the 1800s that Pi is not a rational number.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.280
 So that means only rational numbers have digit sequences that repeat.

09:19.280 --> 09:23.120
 So we know the digits of Pi don't repeat. So now the question is, does,

09:23.120 --> 09:27.520
 you know, zero, one, two, three or whatever do all the digits base 10 or base two, or however

09:27.520 --> 09:33.200
 you work it out, do they all occur with equal frequency? Nobody knows. That's far away from

09:33.200 --> 09:39.600
 what can be understood mathematically at this point. And that's, that's kind of, but I'm even

09:39.600 --> 09:45.920
 looking for step one, which is prove that the center column doesn't repeat, and then prove

09:45.920 --> 09:50.960
 other things about it like equally distribution of equal numbers of zeros and ones. And those are

09:50.960 --> 09:56.160
 things which I, you know, I kind of set up this little prize thing, because I thought those were

09:56.160 --> 10:03.840
 not too out of range. Those are things which are within, you know, a modest amount of time,

10:03.840 --> 10:07.760
 it's conceivable that those could be done. They're not, they're not far away from what

10:07.760 --> 10:12.480
 current mathematics might allow. They'll require a bunch of cleverness and hopefully

10:12.480 --> 10:15.680
 some interesting new ideas that, you know, will be useful other places.

10:15.680 --> 10:22.800
 But you started in 1980 with this idea, before I think you realized, you know, this idea of

10:22.800 --> 10:29.040
 programs, you thought that there might be some kind of thermodynamic like randomness, and then

10:29.040 --> 10:36.320
 complexity comes from a clever filter that you kind of like, I don't know, spaghetti or something.

10:37.360 --> 10:42.400
 You filter the randomness and outcomes complexity, which is an interesting intuition. I mean,

10:42.400 --> 10:48.240
 how do we know that's not actually what's happening? So just because you were then able to develop,

10:49.040 --> 10:54.480
 look, you don't need this like incredible randomness, you can just have very simple,

10:54.480 --> 11:00.000
 predictable initial conditions and predictable rules. And then from that emerged complexity,

11:00.800 --> 11:07.520
 still, there might be some systems where it's filtering randomness on the inputs.

11:07.520 --> 11:13.040
 Well, the point is, when you have quotes randomness in the input, that means there's all kinds of

11:13.040 --> 11:18.960
 information in the input. And in a sense, what you get out will be maybe just something close

11:18.960 --> 11:24.000
 to what you put in. Like people are very in dynamical systems theory, sort of big area of

11:24.000 --> 11:30.080
 mathematics that developed from the early 1900s and really got big in the 1980s. You know,

11:30.080 --> 11:34.320
 an example of what people study there a lot. And it's popular version is chaos theory.

11:34.320 --> 11:40.320
 An example of what people study a lot is the shift map, which is basically taking

11:40.880 --> 11:47.040
 2x mod 1 to the fractional part of 2x, which is basically just taking digits in binary

11:47.040 --> 11:52.160
 and shifting them to the left. So at every step, you get to see if you say, how big is this number

11:52.160 --> 11:57.600
 that I got out? Well, the most important digit in that number is whatever ended up at the left

11:57.600 --> 12:03.280
 hand end. But now if you start off from an arbitrary random number, which is quotes randomly

12:03.280 --> 12:08.880
 chosen, so all its digits are random, then when you run that sort of chaos theory shift map,

12:08.880 --> 12:14.720
 all that you get out is just whatever you put in, you just get to see what you what it's not

12:14.720 --> 12:19.280
 obvious that you would excavate all of those digits. And if you're, for example, making a theory,

12:19.280 --> 12:24.240
 I don't know, fluid mechanics, for example, if there was that phenomenon and fluid mechanics,

12:24.240 --> 12:28.960
 then the equations of fluid mechanics can't be right. Because what that would be saying is

12:28.960 --> 12:34.240
 the equations of that, that it matters to the fluid, what happens in the fluid at the level of

12:34.240 --> 12:39.840
 the, you know, millionth digit of the initial conditions, which is far below the points at

12:39.840 --> 12:43.920
 which you're hitting kind of sizes of molecules and things like that. So it's kind of almost

12:43.920 --> 12:49.680
 explaining if that phenomenon is an important thing, it's kind of telling you that the fluid

12:49.680 --> 12:55.040
 dynamics which describes fluids as continuous media and so on isn't really right. But so,

12:55.040 --> 13:00.240
 you know, so this idea that, you know, there's a, it's a tricky thing, because as soon as you put

13:00.240 --> 13:06.000
 randomness in, you have to know, you know, what, how much of what's coming out is what you put in

13:06.000 --> 13:10.240
 versus how much is actually something that's being generated. And what's really nice about

13:10.240 --> 13:15.360
 these systems where you just have very simple initial conditions, and where you get random stuff

13:15.360 --> 13:20.240
 out or seemingly random stuff out, is you don't have that issue, you don't have to argue about

13:20.240 --> 13:24.240
 was there something complicated put in, because plainly obvious there wasn't. Now,

13:24.240 --> 13:30.960
 as a practical matter in doing experiments, the big thing is, if the thing you see is complex

13:30.960 --> 13:36.960
 and reproducible, then it didn't come from just filtering some quotes randomness from the outside

13:36.960 --> 13:42.640
 world. It has to be something that is intrinsically made, because it wouldn't otherwise be, I mean,

13:42.640 --> 13:47.040
 you know, the, the, the, it could be the case that you set things up, and it's always the same each

13:47.040 --> 13:51.840
 time. And you say, well, it's kind of the same, but it's not then it's not random each time,

13:51.840 --> 13:57.280
 because kind of the definition of it being random is it was kind of picked, picked at random each

13:57.280 --> 14:03.120
 time, so to speak. So is it possible to for sure know that our universe does not at the

14:03.120 --> 14:10.480
 fundamental level have randomness? Is it possible to conclusively say there's no randomness at the

14:10.480 --> 14:16.240
 bottom? Well, it's an interesting question. I mean, you know, science, natural science is an

14:16.240 --> 14:21.600
 inductive business, right? You observe a bunch of things and you say, can we fit these together?

14:21.600 --> 14:27.680
 What is our hypothesis for what's going on? The thing that I think I can say fairly definitively

14:27.680 --> 14:34.240
 is at this point, we understand enough about fundamental physics that there is if there was

14:34.240 --> 14:40.560
 sort of an extra dice being thrown, it's something that doesn't need to be there. We can get what

14:40.560 --> 14:46.640
 we see without that. Now, you know, could you add that in as an extra little featureoid?

14:46.640 --> 14:54.080
 You know, without breaking the universe? Probably. But in fact, almost certainly yes.

14:54.080 --> 14:58.720
 But is it necessary for understanding the universe? No. And I think actually from a more

14:58.720 --> 15:05.520
 fundamental point of view, it's, I think I might be able to argue. So one of the things that I've

15:05.520 --> 15:10.080
 been interested in and been pretty surprised that I've had anything sentient to say about

15:10.080 --> 15:14.960
 is the question of why does the universe exist? I didn't think that was a question that I would,

15:14.960 --> 15:21.440
 you know, I thought that was a far out there metaphysical kind of thing. Even the philosophers

15:21.440 --> 15:26.560
 have stayed away from that question for the most part. It's so such a kind of, you know, difficult

15:26.560 --> 15:32.080
 to address question. But I actually think to my great surprise that from our physics project and

15:32.080 --> 15:38.000
 so on, that it is possible to actually address that question and explain why the universe exists.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.720
 And I kind of have a suspicion. I've not thought it through. I kind of have a suspicion that that

15:42.720 --> 15:48.800
 explanation will eventually show you that in no meaningful sense, can there be randomness

15:48.800 --> 15:55.680
 underneath the universe? That is that if there is, it's something that is necessarily irrelevant

15:55.680 --> 16:01.440
 to our perception of the universe. That is that it could be there, but it doesn't matter. Because

16:01.440 --> 16:06.800
 in a sense, we've already, you know, whatever it would do, whatever extra thing it would add,

16:06.800 --> 16:09.200
 is not relevant to our perception of what's going on.

16:09.200 --> 16:16.400
 So why does the universe exist? How does the irrelevance of randomness connect to

16:17.280 --> 16:22.320
 the big why question of the universe? So, okay. So, I mean, why does the universe exist? Well,

16:22.320 --> 16:28.800
 let's see. And is this the only universe we got? It's the only one. About that, I'm pretty sure.

16:28.800 --> 16:35.120
 So you may be, which one, which of these topics is better to enter first? Why does the universe

16:35.120 --> 16:39.520
 exist? And why you think it's the only one that exists?

16:39.520 --> 16:43.600
 Well, I think they're very closely related. Okay. So, I mean, the first thing,

16:44.640 --> 16:49.920
 let's see. I mean, this, why does the universe exist question is built on top of all these things

16:49.920 --> 16:54.480
 that we've been figuring out about fundamental physics. Because if you want to know why the

16:54.480 --> 17:00.240
 universe exists, you kind of have to know what the universe is made of. And I think the, well,

17:00.240 --> 17:05.520
 let me, let me describe a little bit about the why does the universe exist question. So

17:05.520 --> 17:10.240
 the main issue is, let's say you have a model for the universe. And you say, I've got this,

17:10.240 --> 17:14.720
 this program or something, and you run it and you make the universe. Now you say, well, how do

17:14.720 --> 17:19.440
 you act? Why is that program actually running? And people say, you've got this program that

17:19.440 --> 17:25.040
 makes the universe, what computer is it running on? Right? What, what does it mean? What actualizes

17:25.040 --> 17:29.120
 something, you know, two plus two equals four. But that's different from saying there's two,

17:29.120 --> 17:33.520
 a pile of two rocks and another pile of two rocks and so many moves them together and makes four,

17:33.520 --> 17:39.360
 so to speak. And so what is it that kind of turns it from being just this formal thing

17:39.360 --> 17:45.520
 to being something that is actualized? Okay, so there we have to start thinking about, well,

17:45.520 --> 17:49.360
 well, what do we actually know about what's going on in the universe? Well, we are

17:49.360 --> 17:55.440
 observers of this universe. But confusingly enough, we're part of this universe. So in a sense,

17:55.440 --> 17:59.920
 we, what, what, what, if we say, what do we, what do we know about what's going on in the

17:59.920 --> 18:05.120
 universe? Well, what we know is what sort of our consciousness records about what's going on in

18:05.120 --> 18:10.160
 the universe. And consciousness is part of the fabric of the universe. So we're in it.

18:10.160 --> 18:15.200
 Yes, we're in it. And maybe I should, maybe I should start off by saying something about

18:15.200 --> 18:23.040
 the consciousness story. Because that that's, maybe we should begin even before that at the

18:23.040 --> 18:29.760
 very base layer of the Wolfram physics project. Maybe you can give a broad overview once again,

18:30.560 --> 18:36.480
 really quick about this hypergraph model. Yes. And also, what is it a year and a half ago,

18:36.480 --> 18:42.400
 since you've brought this project to the world, what is the status update? Where what are all the

18:42.400 --> 18:47.760
 beautiful ideas you have come across? What are the interesting things you can mention?

18:47.760 --> 18:53.600
 It's, I mean, it's a, it's a frigging Cambrian explosion. I mean, it's, it's crazy. I mean,

18:53.600 --> 18:58.560
 there are all these things which I've kind of wondered about for years. And suddenly,

18:58.560 --> 19:03.920
 there's actually a way to think about them. And I really did not see, I mean, the real strength

19:03.920 --> 19:08.320
 of what's happened, I absolutely did not see coming. And the real strength of it is, we've

19:08.320 --> 19:13.040
 got this model for physics, but it turns out it's a foundational kind of model that's a different

19:13.040 --> 19:17.920
 kind of computation like model that I'm kind of calling the sort of multi computational model.

19:19.040 --> 19:24.720
 And that, that kind of model is applicable not only to physics, but also to lots of other

19:24.720 --> 19:30.640
 kinds of things. And one reason that's extremely powerful is because physics has been very successful.

19:30.640 --> 19:35.600
 So we know a lot based on what we figured out in physics. And if we know that the same model

19:35.600 --> 19:40.400
 governs physics and governs, I don't know, economics, linguistics, immunology, whatever,

19:40.400 --> 19:45.280
 we know that the same kind of model governs those things. We can start using things that we've

19:45.280 --> 19:49.920
 successfully discovered in physics and applying those intuitions in all these other areas. And

19:49.920 --> 19:55.280
 that's, that's pretty exciting. And, and, and very surprising to me. And in fact, it's kind of like

19:55.280 --> 20:01.120
 in the original story of sort of you go and you explain why is there complexity in the natural

20:01.120 --> 20:04.960
 world, then you realize, well, there's all this complexity, there's all this computational

20:04.960 --> 20:09.600
 irreducibility, you know, there's a lot we can't know about what's going to happen. It's kind of

20:09.600 --> 20:13.600
 it's kind of a very confusing thing for people who say, you know, science has nailed everything

20:13.600 --> 20:17.200
 down, we're going to, you know, based on science, we can know everything. Well, actually, there's

20:17.200 --> 20:22.640
 this computational irreducibility thing, right in the middle of that, thrown up by science, so to

20:22.640 --> 20:27.200
 speak. And then the question is, well, given computational irreducibility, how can we actually

20:27.200 --> 20:31.600
 figure out anything about what happens in the world? Why aren't we, why are we able to predict

20:31.600 --> 20:35.440
 anything? Why are we able to sort of operate in the world? And the answer is that we sort of live

20:35.440 --> 20:40.880
 in these slices of computational reusability that exists in this kind of ocean of computational

20:40.880 --> 20:46.720
 irreducibility. And it turns out that seems that it's a very fundamental feature of the kind of

20:46.720 --> 20:52.800
 model that seems to operate in physics, and perhaps in the bottom of these other areas,

20:52.800 --> 20:57.680
 that there are these particular slices of computational reusability that are relevant

20:57.680 --> 21:03.600
 to us. And those are the things that both allow us to operate in the world, and not just have

21:03.600 --> 21:07.600
 and not just have everything be completely unpredictable. But there are also things that

21:07.600 --> 21:13.120
 potentially give us what amount to sort of physics like laws in all these other areas. So

21:13.120 --> 21:18.320
 that's been sort of an exciting thing. But I would say that in general, for our project,

21:18.320 --> 21:24.560
 it's been going spectacularly well. I mean, it's very, honestly, it wasn't something I expected

21:24.560 --> 21:31.920
 to happen in my lifetime. I mean, it's something where it's, and in fact, one of the things about

21:31.920 --> 21:36.880
 it, some of the things that we've discovered are things where I was pretty sure that wasn't how

21:36.880 --> 21:43.600
 things worked. And turns out I'm wrong. And, you know, in a major area in mathematics, I'd be

21:43.600 --> 21:49.840
 realizing that I've something I've long believed, we can talk about it later, that just really

21:49.840 --> 21:56.720
 isn't right. But I think that the thing that, so what's happened with the physics project,

21:56.720 --> 22:02.640
 I mean, you know, it's a can explain a little bit about how the how the model works. But basically,

22:02.640 --> 22:08.800
 we can maybe ask you the following question. So it's easy through words describe how cellular

22:08.800 --> 22:16.800
 automata works. You've explained this. And it's the fundamental mechanism by which you in your

22:16.800 --> 22:22.480
 book, and you kind of science explored the idea of complexity and how to do science in this world

22:22.480 --> 22:29.760
 of island reducible islands and irreducible generally irreducibility. Okay, so how does

22:29.760 --> 22:35.840
 the model of hypergraphs differ from cellular automata? And how does the idea of multi computation

22:36.480 --> 22:41.600
 differ? Like maybe that's a way to describe it. Right. We're, we're, you know, right. This is a,

22:41.600 --> 22:46.560
 you know, my life is like all of our lives, something of a story of computational irreducibility.

22:46.560 --> 22:51.920
 Yes. And, you know, it's been going for a few years now. So it's always a challenge to kind of

22:51.920 --> 22:57.200
 find these appropriate pockets of reducibility. But let me see what I can do. So, so I mean,

22:57.200 --> 23:03.760
 first of all, let's, let's talk about physics. First of all, and, you know, a key observation

23:04.400 --> 23:10.160
 that one of the starting point of our physics project is things about what is space? What is

23:10.160 --> 23:15.680
 the universe made of? And, you know, ever since Euclid, people just sort of say space is just this

23:15.680 --> 23:20.160
 thing where you can put things at any position you want. And they're just points and they're just

23:20.160 --> 23:25.440
 geometrical things that you can just arbitrarily put at different, different coordinate positions.

23:25.440 --> 23:30.400
 So the first thing in our physics project is the idea that space is made of something,

23:30.400 --> 23:36.000
 just like water is made of molecules, space is made of kind of atoms of space. And the only

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
 thing we can say about these atoms of space is they have some identity. There's a, there's a,

23:40.000 --> 23:44.400
 there is, it's this atom as opposed to this atom. And, you know, you could give them, if you were a

23:44.400 --> 23:51.760
 computer person, you give them UUIDs or something. But that's all there is to say about them,

23:51.760 --> 23:59.840
 so to speak. And then all we know about these atoms of space is how they relate to each other.

23:59.840 --> 24:06.400
 So we say these three atoms of space are associated with each other in some relation. So you can

24:06.400 --> 24:11.920
 think about that as, you know, what atom of space is friends with what other atom of space?

24:11.920 --> 24:17.280
 You can build this essentially friend network of the atoms of space. And the sort of starting

24:17.280 --> 24:21.840
 point of our physics project is that's what our universe is. It's a giant friend network of the

24:21.840 --> 24:29.360
 atoms of space. And so how can that possibly represent our universe? Well, it's like in

24:29.360 --> 24:34.000
 something like water, you know, there are molecules bouncing around, but on a large scale,

24:34.000 --> 24:38.560
 that, you know, that produces fluid flow and we have fluid vortices and we have all of these

24:38.560 --> 24:44.480
 phenomena that are sort of the emergent phenomena from that underlying kind of collection of

24:44.480 --> 24:48.160
 molecules bouncing around. And by the way, it's important that that collection of molecules

24:48.160 --> 24:52.640
 bouncing around have this phenomenon of computational irreducibility. That's actually what

24:52.640 --> 24:58.160
 leads to the second law of thermodynamics, among other things. And that leads to the sort of randomness

24:58.160 --> 25:03.520
 of the underlying behavior, which is what gives you something which on a large scale seems like

25:03.520 --> 25:10.960
 it's a smooth continuous type of thing. And so, okay, so first thing is space is made of something,

25:10.960 --> 25:16.560
 it's made of all these atoms of space connected together in this network. And then everything

25:16.560 --> 25:22.160
 that we experience is sort of features of the of that structure of space. So, you know, when we

25:22.160 --> 25:27.280
 have an electron or something or a photon, it's some kind of tangle in the structure of space,

25:27.280 --> 25:32.880
 much like kind of a vortex and a fluid would be just this thing that is, you know, it can actually

25:32.880 --> 25:37.680
 the vortex can move around, it can involve different molecules in the fluid, but the vortex

25:37.680 --> 25:42.800
 still stays there. And if you zoom out enough, the vortex looks like an atom itself, like a basic

25:42.800 --> 25:49.680
 element. So there's the levels of abstraction. If you squint and kind of blur things out,

25:49.680 --> 25:55.760
 it looks like at every level of abstraction, you can define what is a basic individual entity.

25:55.760 --> 26:01.040
 Yes, but you know, in this model, there's a bottom level, you know, there's an elementary

26:01.040 --> 26:05.680
 length, maybe 10 to the minus 100 meters, let's say, which is really small, you know,

26:05.680 --> 26:11.200
 proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters, the smallest we've ever been able to sort of

26:11.200 --> 26:16.800
 see with the particle accelerators around 10 to the minus 21 meters. So, you know, if we don't

26:16.800 --> 26:20.960
 know precisely what the correct scale is, but it's perhaps over the order of 10 to the minus 100

26:20.960 --> 26:26.880
 meters, so it's pretty small. And but that's the end, that's what things are made of.

26:26.880 --> 26:32.400
 What's your intuition where the 10 to the minus 100 comes from? What's your intuition about this

26:32.400 --> 26:37.840
 scale? Well, okay, so there's a calculation which I consider to be somewhat rickety, okay,

26:37.840 --> 26:43.280
 which has to do with comparing. So, so there are various fundamental constants, there's the speed

26:43.280 --> 26:48.960
 of light, the speed of light, once you know the elementary time, the speed of light is tells you

26:48.960 --> 26:53.120
 the conversion from the elementary time to the elementary length. Then there's the question of

26:53.120 --> 26:58.880
 how do you convert to the elementary energy? And how do you convert to between other things? And

26:58.880 --> 27:02.480
 the various constants we know, we know the speed of light, we know the gravitational constant,

27:03.360 --> 27:07.600
 we know Planck's constant and quantum mechanics, those are the three important ones.

27:07.600 --> 27:11.680
 And we actually know some other things, we know things like the size of the universe,

27:11.680 --> 27:16.960
 the Hubble constant, things like that. And essentially, this calculation of the elementary

27:16.960 --> 27:22.720
 length comes from looking at these sort of combination of those, okay, so the most obvious

27:22.720 --> 27:27.120
 thing, people have sort of assumed that quantum gravity happens at this thing, the Planck scale,

27:27.120 --> 27:32.640
 10 to the minus 34 meters, which is the sort of the combination of Planck's constant and the

27:32.640 --> 27:36.080
 gravitational constant and the speed of light that gives you that kind of length.

27:37.280 --> 27:42.960
 Turns out in our model, there is an additional parameter, which is essentially the number of

27:42.960 --> 27:48.160
 simultaneous threads of execution of the universe, which is essentially the number of sort of independent

27:48.160 --> 27:53.280
 quantum processes that are going on. And that number, let's see if I remember that number,

27:53.280 --> 28:01.200
 that number is 10 to the 170, I think, and so it's a big number. But that number then connects,

28:01.200 --> 28:07.680
 you know, sort of modifies what you might think from all these Planck units to give you the

28:07.680 --> 28:12.000
 things we're giving. And there's been sort of a mystery, actually, in the more technical physics

28:12.000 --> 28:18.960
 thing, that the Planck mass, the Planck energy, Planck energy is actually surprisingly big.

28:18.960 --> 28:23.200
 The Planck length is tiny, 10 to the minus 34 meters, that Planck time 10 to the minus

28:23.200 --> 28:30.880
 43 meters, I think, seconds, I think. But the Planck energy is like the energy of a

28:30.880 --> 28:37.360
 lightning strike, which is pretty weird. In our models, the actual elementary energy is that

28:37.360 --> 28:42.160
 divided by the number of sort of simultaneous quantum threads, and it ends up being really small,

28:42.160 --> 28:48.080
 too. And that sort of explains that mystery that's been around for a while about how Planck units

28:48.080 --> 28:54.640
 work. But whether that precise estimate is right, we don't know yet. I mean, that's one of the things

28:54.640 --> 28:59.360
 that's sort of been a thing we've been pretty interested in, is how do you see through, you

28:59.360 --> 29:04.880
 know, how do you make a gravitational microscope that can kind of see through to the atoms of

29:04.880 --> 29:10.000
 space? You know, how do you get in fluid flow, for example, if you go to hypersonic flow or

29:10.000 --> 29:14.720
 something, you know, you've got a Mach 20, you know, space plane or something, it really matters

29:14.720 --> 29:20.080
 that there are individual molecules hitting the space plane, not a continuous fluid. The question

29:20.080 --> 29:27.200
 is, what is the analogous kind of, what is the analog of hypersonic flow for our, for things about

29:27.200 --> 29:34.000
 the structure of spacetime? And it looks like a rapidly rotating black hole right at the sort of

29:34.000 --> 29:42.640
 critical rotation rate is, it looks as if that's a case where essentially, the structure of spacetime

29:42.640 --> 29:49.760
 is just about to fall apart. And you may be able to kind of see the evidence of sort of discrete

29:50.880 --> 29:55.760
 elements, you know, you may be able to kind of see there, the sort of gravitational microscope

29:55.760 --> 30:01.200
 of actually seeing these discrete elements of space. And there may be some effect in, for example,

30:01.200 --> 30:07.360
 gravitational waves produced by rapidly rotating black hole, that in which one could actually see

30:07.360 --> 30:12.160
 some phenomenon where one can say, yes, these don't come out the way one would expect,

30:12.160 --> 30:17.680
 based on having a continuous structure of spacetime, that it is something where you can kind of see

30:17.680 --> 30:23.120
 through to the discrete structure. We don't know that yet. So can you maybe elaborate a little

30:23.120 --> 30:32.160
 bit deeper how a microscope that can see to 10 to the minus 100, how rotating black holes and

30:32.160 --> 30:40.000
 presumably the detailed accurate detection of gravitational waves from black holes can

30:40.000 --> 30:45.920
 reveal the discreetness of space? Okay, first thing is, what is a black hole? Actually, we need

30:45.920 --> 30:49.360
 to go a little bit further in the story of what spacetime is, because I explained a little bit

30:49.360 --> 30:54.320
 about what space is, but I didn't talk about what time is. And that's sort of important in

30:54.320 --> 30:59.280
 understanding spacetime, so to speak. And your sense is both space and time in the story are

30:59.280 --> 31:05.360
 discrete? Absolutely. Absolutely. But it's a complicated story and needless to say.

31:05.360 --> 31:10.960
 Well, it's simple at the bottom. It's very simple at the bottom. It's very, in the end,

31:11.520 --> 31:18.320
 it's simple but deeply abstract. And something that is simple in conception,

31:18.320 --> 31:22.000
 but kind of wrapping one's head around what's going on is pretty hard.

31:23.120 --> 31:27.920
 But so first of all, we have this, so I've described these kind of atoms of space and

31:27.920 --> 31:32.400
 their connections. You can think about these things as a hypergraph. A graph is just,

31:32.400 --> 31:38.000
 you connect nodes to nodes, but a hypergraph, you can have sort of not just friends,

31:38.880 --> 31:43.200
 individual friends to friends, but you can have these triplets of friends or whatever else.

31:43.200 --> 31:48.800
 And so we're just saying, and that's just the relations between atoms of space

31:48.800 --> 31:53.600
 are the hyper edges of the hypergraph. And so we got some big collection of these atoms of

31:53.600 --> 32:00.000
 space, maybe 10 to the 400 or something in our universe. And that's the structure of space.

32:00.000 --> 32:07.120
 That's an every feature of what we experience in the world is a feature of that hypergraph,

32:07.120 --> 32:12.240
 that spatial hypergraph. So then the question is, well, what does that spatial hypergraph do?

32:12.240 --> 32:18.640
 Well, the idea is that there are rules that update that spatial hypergraph. And in a cellular

32:18.640 --> 32:23.680
 automaton, you've just got this line of cells, and you just say at every step, at every time step,

32:23.680 --> 32:29.200
 you've got fixed time steps, fixed array of cells. At every step, every cell gets updated

32:29.200 --> 32:34.960
 according to a certain rule. And that's kind of the way it works. Now, in this hypergraph,

32:34.960 --> 32:39.760
 it's sort of vaguely the same kind of thing. We say every time you see a little piece of

32:39.760 --> 32:45.200
 hypergraph that looks like this, update it to one that looks like this. So it's just keep

32:45.200 --> 32:49.200
 rewriting this hypergraph. Every time you see something that looks like that, anywhere in the

32:49.200 --> 32:54.240
 universe, it gets rewritten. Now, one thing that's tricky about that, which we'll come to is this

32:54.240 --> 33:00.320
 multi computational idea, which has to do with, you're not saying, in some kind of lock step way,

33:00.320 --> 33:04.640
 do this one, then this one, then this one, it's just whenever you see one you can do,

33:04.640 --> 33:10.480
 you can go ahead and do it. And that leads one not to have a single thread of time in the universe.

33:11.120 --> 33:14.960
 Because if you knew which one to do, you would just say, okay, we do this one,

33:14.960 --> 33:19.040
 then we do this one, then we do this one. But if you say just do whichever one you feel like,

33:19.040 --> 33:23.040
 you end up with these multiple threads of time, these kind of multiple histories of the universe,

33:23.040 --> 33:26.480
 depending on which order you happen to do the things you could do in.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.760
 So it's fundamentally asynchronous and parallel?

33:29.760 --> 33:36.240
 Yes. Yes. Which is very uncomfortable for the human brain that seeks for things to be sequential

33:36.240 --> 33:42.560
 and synchronous. Right. Well, I think that this is part of the story of consciousness,

33:42.560 --> 33:48.480
 is I think the key aspect of consciousness that is important for sort of parsing the universe

33:48.480 --> 33:53.680
 is this point that we have a single thread of experience. We have a memory of what happened

33:53.680 --> 33:57.440
 in the past, we can say something, predict something about the future, but there's a

33:57.440 --> 34:00.960
 single thread of experience. And it's not obvious it should work that way. I mean, we've got 100

34:00.960 --> 34:05.520
 billion neurons in our brains, and they're all firing in all kinds of different ways. But yet,

34:05.520 --> 34:13.840
 our experience is that there is the single thread of time that goes along. And I think that,

34:13.840 --> 34:17.360
 one of the things I've kind of realized with a lot more clarity in the last year,

34:17.360 --> 34:24.800
 is the fact that we conclude that the universe has the laws it has is a consequence of the fact

34:24.800 --> 34:30.240
 that we have consciousness the way we have consciousness. And so the fact, so I mean,

34:30.240 --> 34:35.360
 just to go on with kind of the basic setup, it's, so we got this spatial hypergraph,

34:35.360 --> 34:40.080
 it's got all these atoms of space, they're getting these little clumps of atoms of space

34:40.080 --> 34:42.800
 are getting turned into other clumps of atoms of space, and that's happening everywhere in the

34:42.800 --> 34:47.520
 universe all the time. And so one thing that's a little bit weird is there's nothing permanent

34:47.520 --> 34:51.920
 in the universe. The universe is getting rewritten everywhere all the time. And if it wasn't getting

34:51.920 --> 34:56.720
 rewritten, space wouldn't be knitted together. That is, space would just fall apart. There wouldn't

34:56.720 --> 35:01.760
 be any way in which we could say this part of space is next to this part of space. One of the

35:01.760 --> 35:08.080
 things that people were confused about back in antiquity, the ancient Greek philosophers and

35:08.080 --> 35:13.680
 so on is how does motion work? How can it be the case that you can take a thing that we can walk

35:13.680 --> 35:19.840
 around? And it's still us when we walked a foot forward, so to speak. And in a sense with our

35:19.840 --> 35:25.680
 models, that's again, a question, because it's a different set of atoms of space when we, you know,

35:25.680 --> 35:31.520
 when I move my hand, it's moving into a different set of atoms of space. It's having to be recreated,

35:31.520 --> 35:37.040
 it's not the thing itself is not there, it's being continuously recreated all the time. Now,

35:37.040 --> 35:41.920
 it's a little bit like waves in an ocean, you know, vortices and fluid, which again, the actual

35:41.920 --> 35:48.160
 molecules that exist in those are not what define the identity of the thing. And but it's a little

35:48.160 --> 35:54.320
 bit, you know, this idea that there can be pure motion, that it can, that it is even possible

35:54.320 --> 36:00.240
 for an object to just move around in the universe and not change. It's not self evident that such

36:00.240 --> 36:05.200
 a thing should be possible. And that is part of our perception of the universe is that we

36:06.160 --> 36:11.360
 parse those aspects of the universe where things like pure motion are possible. Now, pure motion,

36:11.360 --> 36:16.640
 even in general relativity, the theory of gravity, pure motion is a little bit of a complicated thing.

36:16.640 --> 36:21.760
 I mean, if you imagine your average, you know, teacup or something approaching a black hole,

36:21.760 --> 36:26.800
 it is deformed and distorted by the structure of space time. And to say, you know, is it really

36:26.800 --> 36:31.920
 pure motion? Is it that same teacup that's the same shape? Well, it's a bit of a complicated story.

36:31.920 --> 36:37.760
 And this is a more extreme version of that. So, so anyway, the thing that that's happening is

36:37.760 --> 36:44.000
 we got space, we've got this notion of time. So time is this kind of this rewriting of the

36:44.000 --> 36:48.800
 hypergraph. And one of the things that's important about that time is this sort of computational

36:48.800 --> 36:53.840
 irreducible process. There's something, you know, time is not something where it's kind of the

36:53.840 --> 37:00.320
 mathematical view of time tends to be time is just a coordinate, we can, you know, slide a slider,

37:00.320 --> 37:06.800
 turn a knob, and we'll change the time that we've got in this equation. But in this picture of time,

37:06.800 --> 37:12.960
 that's not how it works at all. Time is this inexorable, irreducible kind of set of computations

37:12.960 --> 37:18.880
 that go on that go from where we are now to the future. But so so the thing, and one of the things

37:18.880 --> 37:24.880
 that is again, something one sort of has to break out of is your average trained physicist like me

37:24.880 --> 37:29.680
 says, you know, space and time are the same kind of thing. They're related by, you know, the prank

37:29.680 --> 37:34.400
 array group and Lawrence transformations and relativity and all these kinds of things. And,

37:34.400 --> 37:39.280
 you know, space and time, you know, there are all these kind of sort of folk stories you can tell

37:39.280 --> 37:43.600
 about why space and time are the same kind of thing. In this model, they're fundamentally not

37:43.600 --> 37:49.360
 the same kind of thing. Space is this kind of sort of connections between these atoms of space.

37:49.360 --> 37:54.720
 Time is this computational process. So the thing that the first sort of surprising thing

37:54.720 --> 38:00.160
 is, well, it turns out you get relativity anyway. And the reason that happens that a few bits and

38:00.160 --> 38:06.560
 pieces here, which one has to understand, but but the fundamental point is, if you are an observer

38:06.560 --> 38:12.720
 embedded in the system, that a part of this whole story of things getting updated in this way and

38:12.720 --> 38:17.760
 that, there are there's sort of a limit to what you can tell about what's going on. And really,

38:17.760 --> 38:23.200
 in the end, the only thing you can tell is what are the causal relationships between events. So an

38:23.200 --> 38:30.160
 event in this sort of an elementary event is a little piece of hypergraph got rewritten. And

38:30.160 --> 38:35.520
 that means a few hyper edges of the hypergraph were consumed by the event. And you produce some

38:35.520 --> 38:42.000
 other hyper edges. And that's an elementary event. And so then the question is, what we can tell

38:42.000 --> 38:47.120
 is kind of what the network of causal relationships between elementary events is.

38:47.120 --> 38:52.800
 That's the ultimate thing, the causal graph of the universe. And it turns out that, well, there's

38:52.800 --> 38:58.800
 this property of causal invariance that is true of a bunch of these models. And I think is inevitably

38:58.800 --> 39:06.640
 true for a variety of reasons. That makes it be the case that it doesn't matter kind of if you are

39:07.200 --> 39:11.040
 sort of saying, well, I've got this hypergraph, and I can rewrite this piece here and this piece

39:11.040 --> 39:15.680
 here. And I do them all in different orders. When you construct the causal graph for each of those

39:15.680 --> 39:22.560
 orders, that you choose to do things in, you'll end up with the same causal graph. And so that's

39:22.560 --> 39:28.960
 essentially why, well, that's in the end, why relativity works. It's why our perception of

39:28.960 --> 39:35.600
 space and time is as having this kind of connection that relativity says they should have. And that's

39:35.600 --> 39:41.760
 kind of how that works. I think I'm missing a little piece. If we can go there again, you said

39:41.760 --> 39:48.400
 the fact that the observer is embedded in this hypergraph, what's missing? What is the observer

39:48.400 --> 39:55.440
 not able to state about this universe of space and time? If you look from the outside, you can say,

39:55.440 --> 40:04.880
 oh, I see this particular place was updated, and then this one was updated, and I'm seeing

40:04.880 --> 40:09.360
 which order things were updated in. But the observer embedded in the universe doesn't know

40:09.360 --> 40:14.000
 which order things were updated in, because until they've been updated, they have no idea what else

40:14.000 --> 40:19.360
 happened. So the only thing they know is the set of causal relationships. Let me give an extreme

40:19.360 --> 40:25.040
 example. Let's imagine that the universe is a Turing machine. Turing machines have just this one

40:25.040 --> 40:30.800
 update head, which does something, and otherwise the Turing machine just does nothing. And the

40:30.800 --> 40:35.920
 Turing machine works by having this head move around and do its updating just where the head

40:35.920 --> 40:41.040
 happens to be. The question is, could the universe be a Turing machine? Could the universe just have

40:41.040 --> 40:45.440
 a single updating head that's just zipping around all over the place? You say, that's crazy, because

40:46.320 --> 40:51.760
 I'm talking to you, you seem to be updating, I'm updating, etc. But the thing is, there's no way

40:51.760 --> 40:56.640
 to know that, because if there was just this head moving around, it's like, okay, it updates me,

40:56.640 --> 41:01.200
 but you're completely frozen at that point. Until the head has come over and updated you,

41:01.200 --> 41:06.400
 you have no idea what happened to me. And so if you unravel that argument, you realize the only

41:06.400 --> 41:12.320
 thing we actually can tell is what the network of causal relationships between the things that

41:12.320 --> 41:18.800
 happened were. We don't get to know from some sort of outside sort of God's eye view of the thing.

41:18.800 --> 41:25.280
 We don't get to know what sort of from the outside what happened. We only get to know

41:25.280 --> 41:29.680
 sort of what the set of relationships between the things that happened actually were.

41:29.680 --> 41:36.320
 Yeah, but if I somehow record like a trace of this, I guess we'll be called multi computation.

41:36.880 --> 41:45.040
 Can't I then look back? When you record the trace some you place throughout the universe,

41:45.040 --> 41:52.400
 like throughout, like a log that records in my own pocket of in this hypergraph, can't I

41:52.400 --> 41:58.960
 like realizing that I'm getting an outdated picture? Can't I record?

41:58.960 --> 42:04.720
 See, the problem is, and this is where things start getting very entangled in terms of what

42:04.720 --> 42:10.720
 one understands. The problem is that any such recording device is itself part of the universe.

42:11.680 --> 42:16.720
 So you don't get to say, you never get to say, let's go outside the universe and go do this.

42:16.720 --> 42:23.280
 And that's why, I mean, lots of the features of this model and the way things work end up

42:23.280 --> 42:28.240
 being a result of that. So, but what I guess from on a human level, what is

42:28.880 --> 42:34.160
 the cost you're paying? What are you missing from not getting an updated picture all the time?

42:34.160 --> 42:36.320
 Okay, I got, I understand what you're just saying. Yeah, yeah, right.

42:36.320 --> 42:42.880
 But like what, like how does consciousness emerge from that? Like how, like, what are the

42:42.880 --> 42:47.280
 limitations of that observer? I understand you're getting a delay. Well, there's a, okay,

42:47.280 --> 42:52.240
 there's, there's, there's a bunch of limitations of the observer, I think. Maybe just explain

42:52.240 --> 42:56.000
 something about quantum mechanics, because that maybe is a, is an extreme version of some of

42:56.000 --> 43:00.800
 these issues, which helps to kind of motivate why one should sort of think things through a little

43:00.800 --> 43:08.000
 bit more carefully. So one feature of the, of this, okay, so in standard physics, like high

43:08.000 --> 43:13.360
 school physics, you learn, you know, the equations of motion for a ball. And the, the, you know,

43:13.360 --> 43:18.080
 it says, you throw the ball this angle, this velocity, things will move in this way. And

43:18.080 --> 43:22.960
 there's a definite answer, right? The story, the key story of quantum mechanics is there

43:22.960 --> 43:27.600
 aren't definite answers to where does the ball go? There's kind of this whole sort of bundle of

43:27.600 --> 43:33.680
 possible paths. And all we say we know from quantum mechanics is certain probabilities

43:33.680 --> 43:38.320
 for where the ball will end up. Okay. So that's kind of the, the core idea of quantum mechanics.

43:38.320 --> 43:44.320
 So in our models, you, quantum mechanics is not some kind of plug in add on type thing.

43:44.320 --> 43:48.320
 You absolutely cannot get away from quantum mechanics, because as you think about updating

43:48.320 --> 43:53.040
 this hypergraph, there isn't just one sequence of things, one definite sequence of things that

43:53.040 --> 43:57.520
 can happen. There are all these different possible update sequences that can occur. You could do

43:57.520 --> 44:01.360
 this, you know, piece of the hypergraph now, and then this one later, and et cetera, et cetera,

44:01.360 --> 44:07.600
 et cetera. All those different paths of history correspond to these quantum, quantum paths and

44:07.600 --> 44:11.600
 quantum mechanics, these different possible quantum histories. And one of the things that's

44:11.600 --> 44:16.800
 kind of surprising about it is they, they branch, you know, there can be a certain state of the

44:16.800 --> 44:22.000
 universe, and it could do this or it could do that, but they can also merge. There can be two

44:22.000 --> 44:27.120
 states of the universe, which their next state, the next state they produce is the same for both

44:27.120 --> 44:31.680
 of them. And that process of branching and merging is kind of critical. And the idea that they can

44:31.680 --> 44:36.160
 be merging is critical and somewhat nontrivial for these hypergraphs, because there's a whole

44:36.160 --> 44:40.160
 graph isomorphism story, and there's a whole very elaborate set of mathematics.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.000
 That's where the causal invariance comes in.

44:42.000 --> 44:50.160
 Yes, among other things. Right. Yes. But so then what happens is that what one's seeing,

44:50.160 --> 44:54.080
 okay, so we've got this thing, it's branching, it's merging, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

44:54.080 --> 44:59.680
 Okay, so now the question is, how do we perceive that? What, you know, how do we,

44:59.680 --> 45:04.320
 do we, why don't we notice that the universe is branching and merging? Why, you know, why is it

45:04.320 --> 45:09.280
 the case that we just think a definite set of things happen? Well, the answer is we are embedded

45:09.280 --> 45:15.280
 in that universe, and our brains are branching and merging too. And so what quantum mechanics

45:15.280 --> 45:21.840
 becomes a story of is how does a branching brain perceive a branching universe? And the key thing

45:21.840 --> 45:27.680
 is, as soon as you say, I think definite things happen in the universe, that means you are essentially

45:27.680 --> 45:33.440
 conflating lots of different parts of history. You're saying, actually, as far as I'm concerned,

45:33.440 --> 45:38.160
 because I'm convinced that definite things happen in the universe, all these parts of history must

45:38.160 --> 45:42.720
 be equivalent. Now, it's not obvious that that would be a consistent thing to do. It might be,

45:42.720 --> 45:47.680
 you say, all these parts of history are equivalent, but by golly, moments later, that would be a

45:47.680 --> 45:51.520
 completely inconsistent point of view. Everything would have, you know, gone to hell in different

45:51.520 --> 45:56.000
 ways. The fact that that doesn't happen is, well, that's a consequence of this causal

45:56.000 --> 46:01.200
 invariance thing. But that's, and the fact that that does happen a little bit is what causes little

46:01.200 --> 46:07.760
 quantum effects. And that if that didn't happen at all, there wouldn't be anything that sort of

46:07.760 --> 46:12.160
 is like quantum mechanics. It would be quantum mechanics is kind of like in this,

46:13.360 --> 46:17.520
 in this kind of this bundle of paths. It's a little bit like what happens in statistical

46:17.520 --> 46:22.240
 mechanics and fluid mechanics, whatever, that most of the time, you just see this continuous fluid,

46:22.240 --> 46:26.480
 you just see the world just progressing in this kind of way that's like this continuous fluid.

46:26.480 --> 46:30.560
 But every so often, if you look at the exact right experiment, you can start seeing, well,

46:30.560 --> 46:34.560
 actually, it's made of these molecules where they might go that way, or they might go this way.

46:34.560 --> 46:41.840
 And that's kind of quantum effects. And so that's so the this kind of idea of where we're sort of

46:41.840 --> 46:47.120
 embedded in the universe, this branching brain is perceiving this branching universe. And that ends

46:47.120 --> 46:51.920
 up being sort of a story of quantum mechanics. That's, that's part of the whole picture of

46:51.920 --> 46:56.080
 what's going on. But I think, I mean, to come back to sort of where does conscious, what is,

46:56.080 --> 47:01.600
 what is the story of consciousness? So in the universe, we've got, you know, whatever it is,

47:01.600 --> 47:06.560
 10 to the 400 atoms of space, they're all doing these complicated things. It's all a big, complicated,

47:06.560 --> 47:12.880
 irreducible computation. The question is, what do we perceive from all of that? And the answer is that

47:12.880 --> 47:20.720
 we are, we are parsing the universe in a particular way. Let me again, go back to the gas molecules

47:20.720 --> 47:26.160
 analogy. You know, in the gas in this room, there are molecules bouncing around all kinds of complicated

47:26.160 --> 47:32.960
 patterns. But we don't care. All we notice is there's, you know, the gas laws are satisfied.

47:32.960 --> 47:38.720
 Maybe there's some fluid dynamics. These are kind of features of that assembly of molecules that we

47:38.720 --> 47:43.680
 notice. And then lots of details we don't notice. When you say we, do you mean the tools of physics,

47:43.680 --> 47:46.960
 or do you mean literally the human brain and its perception system?

47:47.600 --> 47:52.080
 Well, okay. So the human brain is where it starts, but we built a bunch of instruments to do a bit

47:52.080 --> 47:56.080
 better than the human brain. But they still have many of the same kinds of ideas, you know, their

47:56.080 --> 48:02.160
 cameras and their pressure sensors and these kinds of things. They're not, you know, at this point,

48:02.160 --> 48:07.360
 we don't know how to make fundamentally qualitatively different sensory devices.

48:07.360 --> 48:13.600
 Right. So it's always just an extension of the conscious experience or our sensory experience.

48:13.600 --> 48:20.320
 Sensory experience, but sensory experience that's somehow intricately tied to consciousness.

48:20.320 --> 48:24.640
 Right. Well, so, so one question is when we are looking at all these molecules in the gas,

48:24.640 --> 48:29.120
 and there might be 10 to 20 molecules in some little, little box or something, it's like,

48:29.680 --> 48:34.320
 what, what do we notice about those molecules? So one thing that we can say is we don't notice

48:34.320 --> 48:41.920
 that much. We are, you know, we are computationally bounded observers. We can't go in and say,

48:41.920 --> 48:47.280
 okay, I'm the 10 to 20th molecules, and I know that I can sort of decrypt their motions and I

48:47.280 --> 48:51.840
 can figure out this and that. It's like, I'm just going to say what's the average density of molecules.

48:51.840 --> 48:57.680
 And so one key feature of us is that we are computationally bounded. And that when you

48:57.680 --> 49:03.040
 are looking at a universe, which is full of computation and doing huge amounts of computation,

49:03.040 --> 49:07.360
 but we are computationally bounded, there's only certain things about that universe that

49:07.360 --> 49:11.920
 we're going to be sensitive to. We're not going to be, you know, figuring out what all the atoms

49:11.920 --> 49:18.320
 of space are doing, because we're just computationally bounded observers, and we are only sampling

49:18.320 --> 49:23.680
 these, these small set of features. So I think the two defining features of consciousness that,

49:23.680 --> 49:29.840
 and I, you know, I would say that the sort of the preamble to this is for years, you know,

49:29.840 --> 49:34.400
 because I've talked about sort of computation and fundamental features of physics and science,

49:34.400 --> 49:39.280
 people ask me, so what about consciousness? And I, for years, I've said, I have nothing to say

49:39.280 --> 49:43.760
 about consciousness. And, you know, I've kind of told this story, you know, you talk about

49:43.760 --> 49:49.280
 intelligence, you talk about life. These are both features where you say, what's the abstract

49:49.280 --> 49:52.720
 definition of life, we don't really know the abstract definition, we know the one for life on

49:52.720 --> 49:57.280
 earth, it's got RNA, it's got cell membranes, it's got all this kind of stuff. Similarly,

49:57.280 --> 50:02.480
 for intelligence, we know the human definition of intelligence, but what is intelligence abstractly,

50:02.480 --> 50:07.840
 we don't really know. And so what I've long believed is that sort of the abstract definition

50:07.840 --> 50:13.760
 of intelligence is just computational sophistication. That is, that as soon as you can be computationally

50:13.760 --> 50:19.680
 sophisticated, that's kind of the abstract version, the generalized version of intelligence.

50:19.680 --> 50:24.400
 So then the question is, what about consciousness? And what I sort of realized is that consciousness

50:24.400 --> 50:30.800
 is actually a step down from intelligence. That is, that you might think, oh, you know,

50:30.800 --> 50:36.800
 consciousness is the top of the pile. But actually, I don't think it is. I think that there's this

50:36.800 --> 50:41.520
 notion of kind of computational sophistication, which is the generalized intelligence. But

50:41.520 --> 50:47.360
 consciousness has two limitations, I think. One of them is computational boundedness. That is,

50:47.360 --> 50:53.200
 that we're only perceiving a sort of computationally bounded view of the universe. And the other is

50:53.200 --> 50:59.120
 this idea of a single thread of time. That is, that we, and in fact, we know neurophysiologically,

50:59.120 --> 51:04.720
 our brains go to some trouble to give us this one thread of attention, so to speak. And it

51:04.720 --> 51:10.640
 isn't the case that, you know, in all the neurons in our brains, that, that in at least in our conscious,

51:10.640 --> 51:14.560
 note the, you know, the correspondence of language in our conscious experience,

51:14.560 --> 51:19.920
 we just have the single thread of attention, single thread of, of perception. And, you know,

51:19.920 --> 51:24.640
 maybe there's something unconscious that's bubbling around. That's the kind of almost the quantum

51:24.640 --> 51:29.280
 version of what's happening in our brain, so to speak. We've got the, the classical flow of what

51:29.280 --> 51:34.000
 we are mostly thinking about, so to speak. But there's this kind of bubbling around of other

51:34.000 --> 51:39.600
 paths that is all those other neurons that didn't make it to be part of our sort of conscious stream

51:39.600 --> 51:45.360
 of experience. So in that sense, intelligence as computational sophistication is much broader

51:45.360 --> 51:54.080
 than, than the, the computational constraints, which consciousness operates under and also

51:54.080 --> 51:59.840
 the sequential, like the sequential thing, like the notion of time. That's, that's kind of interesting.

51:59.840 --> 52:04.480
 But then the, the follow up question is like, okay, starting to get a sense of what is intelligence

52:05.040 --> 52:07.760
 and how does that connect to our human brain? Because you're saying

52:10.400 --> 52:15.040
 intelligence is almost like a fabric, like what we like plug into it or something. Like,

52:15.040 --> 52:18.320
 yeah, I think, you know, people, our consciousness plugs into it.

52:18.320 --> 52:23.520
 Yeah. I mean, the intelligence, I think the core, I mean, you know, intelligence at some

52:23.520 --> 52:28.480
 level is just a word, but we're asking, you know, what is the, the notion of intelligence

52:28.480 --> 52:33.600
 as we generalize it beyond the bounds of humans, beyond the bounds of even the AIs that we humans

52:33.600 --> 52:39.120
 have built and so on, you know, what, what is intelligence? You know, is the weather, you know,

52:39.120 --> 52:42.640
 people say the weather has a mind of its own. What does that mean? You know, can the weather be

52:42.640 --> 52:48.320
 intelligent? Yeah. What does agency have to do with intelligence here? So is intelligence just

52:48.320 --> 52:54.640
 like your conception of computation? Just intelligence is a, is the capacity to perform

52:54.640 --> 52:59.840
 computation in the sea of? Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think that's right. And I think that,

52:59.840 --> 53:06.560
 you know, this question of, of, is it for a purpose? Okay. That quickly degenerates into

53:06.560 --> 53:11.920
 a horrible philosophical mess. Because, you know, whenever you say, did the weather do that for a

53:11.920 --> 53:17.200
 purpose? Yeah. Right? Well, yes, it did. It was trying to move a bunch of hot air from the equator

53:17.200 --> 53:23.200
 to the poles or something. That's its purpose. But why? Because I seem to be equally as dumb

53:23.200 --> 53:29.600
 today as I was yesterday. So there's some persistence, like a consistency over time

53:29.600 --> 53:35.280
 that the intelligence I plugged into. So like, what's, it seems like there's a hard constraint.

53:36.320 --> 53:40.720
 Well, that's not. Between the amount of computation I can perform in my consciousness.

53:40.720 --> 53:45.280
 Like they seem to be really closely connected somehow. Well, I think the point is that the

53:45.280 --> 53:52.000
 thing that gives you kind of the ability to have kind of conscious intelligence,

53:52.880 --> 53:58.320
 you can have kind of this. Okay. So, so one thing is we don't know intelligence is other

53:58.320 --> 54:03.920
 than the ones that are very much like us. Yes. Right. And the ones that are very much like us,

54:03.920 --> 54:09.280
 I think have this feature of single thread of time bounded, you know, computationally bounded.

54:09.280 --> 54:14.480
 Now, that, but you also need computational sophistication. Having a single thread of

54:14.480 --> 54:19.760
 time and being computationally bounded, you could just be a clock going tick tock, you know,

54:19.760 --> 54:26.320
 that would satisfy those conditions. But the fact that we have this sort of irreducible,

54:26.880 --> 54:32.240
 you know, computational ability, that's, that's an important feature. That's, that's the sort of

54:32.240 --> 54:38.560
 the bedrock on which we can construct the things we construct. Now, the fact that we have this

54:38.560 --> 54:43.520
 experience of the world that has the single thread of time and computational boundedness,

54:43.520 --> 54:50.880
 the thing that I sort of realized is it's that that causes us to deduce from this irreducible

54:50.880 --> 54:56.880
 mess of what's going on in the physical world, the laws of physics that we think exist. So,

54:56.880 --> 55:03.440
 in other words, if we say, why do we believe that there is, you know, a continuous space,

55:03.440 --> 55:08.960
 let's say, why do we believe that gravity works the way it does? Well, in principle,

55:08.960 --> 55:15.840
 we could be kind of parsing details of the universe that were, you know, that, okay,

55:15.840 --> 55:23.600
 the analogy is, again, with the statistical mechanics and molecules in a box, we could be

55:23.600 --> 55:27.760
 sensitive to every little detail of the swirling around of those molecules. And we could say,

55:27.760 --> 55:33.440
 what really matters is the, you know, the wiggle effect. Yes. That is, you know, that is something

55:33.440 --> 55:38.160
 that we humans just never notice because it's some weird thing that happens when there are 15

55:38.160 --> 55:43.360
 collisions of air molecules and this happens and that happens. We just see the pure motion of a

55:43.360 --> 55:49.840
 ball moving about. Right. Why do we see that? Right. And the point is that, that what seems

55:49.840 --> 55:55.840
 to be the case is that the things that if we say, given this sort of hypergraph that's updating and

55:55.840 --> 56:00.640
 all the details about all the sort of, sort of atoms of space and what they do, and we say,

56:00.640 --> 56:06.080
 how do we slice that to what we can be sensitive to? What seems to be the case is that as soon as

56:06.080 --> 56:12.080
 we assume, you know, computational boundedness, single thread of time, that leads us to general

56:12.080 --> 56:17.040
 relativity. In other words, we can't avoid that. That that's the way that we, we will parse the

56:17.040 --> 56:22.800
 universe. Given those constraints, we parse the universe according to those particular,

56:22.800 --> 56:30.400
 in such a way that we say the aggregate reducible, sort of, pocket of computational

56:30.400 --> 56:37.520
 reducibility that we slice out of this kind of whole computationally irreducible ocean of behavior

56:37.520 --> 56:41.280
 is just this one that corresponds to general relativity. Yeah, but we don't perceive general

56:41.280 --> 56:47.520
 relativity. Well, we do if we do fancy experiments. So you're saying, so perceive really does mean

56:47.520 --> 56:52.160
 the fault. We drop something. That's a great example of general relativity in action. No,

56:52.160 --> 56:55.520
 but like, what's the difference between that and Newtonian mechanics? I mean,

56:55.520 --> 57:00.880
 Oh, it doesn't. This is, when I say general relativity, that's even gravity, the Uber theory,

57:00.880 --> 57:05.920
 so to speak. I mean, Newtonian gravity is just the approximation that we can make,

57:05.920 --> 57:11.600
 you know, on the earth and things like that. So, so this is, you know, the phenomenon of gravity

57:11.600 --> 57:17.040
 is one that is a consequence of, you know, we would perceive something very different from

57:17.040 --> 57:25.440
 gravity. So, so the way to understand that is when we think about, okay, so we make up reference

57:25.440 --> 57:30.880
 frames with which we parse what's happening in space and time. So in other words, one of the,

57:30.880 --> 57:39.600
 one of the things that we do is we say, as time progresses, everywhere in space is something

57:39.600 --> 57:43.920
 happens at a particular time. And then we go to the next time, and we say, this is what space is

57:43.920 --> 57:49.680
 like at the next time, this is what space is like at the next time. That's, it's the reason we are

57:49.680 --> 57:55.840
 used to doing that is because, you know, when we look around, we might see, you know, 10, 100 meters

57:55.840 --> 58:01.840
 away. The time it takes light to travel that distance is really short compared to the time it

58:01.840 --> 58:07.360
 takes our brains to know what happened. So as far as our brains are concerned, we are parsing the

58:07.360 --> 58:12.480
 universe in this, there is a moment in time, it's all of space, there's a moment in time, it's all

58:12.480 --> 58:17.200
 of space. You know, if we were the size of planets or something, we would have a different perception

58:17.200 --> 58:21.680
 because the speed of light would be much more important to us. We wouldn't have this perception

58:21.680 --> 58:27.840
 that things happen progressively in time, everywhere in space. And so that's an important

58:27.840 --> 58:33.280
 kind of constraint. And the reason that we kind of parse the universe in the way that causes us to

58:33.280 --> 58:39.520
 say gravity works the way it does, is because we're doing things like deciding that we can say the

58:39.520 --> 58:45.680
 universe exists, space has a definite structure. There is a moment in time, space has this definite

58:45.680 --> 58:50.720
 structure, we move to the next moment in time, space has another structure. That kind of setup

58:50.720 --> 58:57.600
 is what lets us kind of deduce kind of what to parse the universe in such a way that we say

58:57.600 --> 59:02.960
 gravity works the way it does. So that kind of reference frame is that the illusion of that

59:02.960 --> 59:09.840
 is that you're saying that somehow useful for consciousness. That's what consciousness does,

59:09.840 --> 59:18.640
 because in a sense, what consciousness is doing is it's insisting that the universe is kind of

59:18.640 --> 59:24.400
 sequentialized. That is, and it is not allowing the possibility that, oh, there are these multiple

59:24.400 --> 59:30.640
 threads of time, and they're all flowing differently. It's like saying, no, everything is happening in

59:30.640 --> 59:36.160
 this one thread of experience that we have. And that illusion of that one thread of experience

59:36.160 --> 59:41.760
 cannot happen at the planetary scale. Are you saying typical human? Are you saying we are at a

59:41.760 --> 59:49.520
 human level special here for consciousness? Well, for our kind of consciousness, if we existed at

59:49.520 --> 59:53.600
 a scale close to the elementary length, for example, then our perception of the universe

59:53.600 --> 59:58.560
 will be absurdly different. But this makes consciousness seem like a weird side effect

59:58.560 --> 1:00:04.160
 to this particular scale. And so who cares? I mean, the consciousness is not that special.

1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:09.600
 I think that a very interesting question is, which I've certainly thought a little bit about,

1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:16.080
 is what can you imagine? What is a sort of factoring of something? What are some other

1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:23.600
 possible ways you could exist, so to speak? And if you were a photon, if you were some kind of

1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:32.160
 thing that was kind of intelligence represented in terms of photons. For example, the photons we

1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:36.640
 receive in the cosmic microwave background, those photons, as far as their concern, the universe

1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:41.600
 just started. They were emitted 100,000 years after the beginning of the universe. They've

1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:46.800
 been traveling at the speed of light. Time stayed still for them. And then they just arrived and we

1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:53.120
 just detected them. So for them, the universe just started. And that's a different perception of

1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:56.800
 that has implications for a very different perception of time. They don't have that

1:00:56.800 --> 1:01:01.840
 single thread that seems to be really important for being able to tell a heck of a good story.

1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:06.880
 So we humans tell a story. We can tell a story. Right. We can tell a story. What other kinds of

1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:12.640
 stories can you tell? So a photon is a really boring story. Yeah. I mean, so that's a, I don't

1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:17.280
 know if they're a boring story, but I think it's, I've been wondering about this and I've been

1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:20.960
 asking friends of mine who have science fiction writers and things, have you written stuff about

1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:26.080
 this? And I've got one example, great, great collection of books from my friend Rudy Rucker,

1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:33.200
 which were, which I have to say, the, their books about, that are very informed by a bunch of science

1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:38.480
 that I've done. And the thing that I really loved about them is, you know, in the first

1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:44.080
 chapter of the book, the earth is consumed by these things called nants, which are nano,

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:49.520
 nanobot type things. Nice. So, you know, so the earth is gone in the first, but then it comes back.

1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:54.160
 But, but, but then spoiler alert. Yeah, right. That was a, that was only a micro spoiler. It's

1:01:54.160 --> 1:02:01.040
 only chapter one. Okay. It's, it's the, but, but the thing that is, is not a real spoiler alert

1:02:01.040 --> 1:02:07.120
 because it's such a complicated concept. But, but in the end, in the end, the, the earth is saved

1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:11.680
 by this thing called the principle of computational equivalence, which is a kind of a core scientific

1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:17.280
 idea of mine. And I was just like, like thrilled. I don't read fiction books very often. And I was

1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:21.840
 just thrilled. I get to the end of this. And it's like, Oh my gosh, you know, everything is saved

1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:26.480
 by this sort of deep scientific principle. Can you, can you maybe elaborate how the principle

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:35.520
 of computational equivalence can save a planet? That would, that would be a terrible spoiler for

1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:39.040
 me. That would be a spoiler. Okay. But, but, but no, but let me say what the principle of

1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:46.160
 computational equivalence is. So the question is, you are, you have a system, you have some rule,

1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:51.280
 you can think of its behavior as corresponding to a computation. The question is, how sophisticated

1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:55.600
 is that computation? The statement of the principle of computational equivalence is,

1:02:55.600 --> 1:03:01.520
 as soon as it's, it's not obviously simple, it will be as sophisticated as anything. And so

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:08.000
 that has the implication that, you know, rule 30, you know, our brains, other things in physics,

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.640
 they're all ultimately equivalent in the computations they can do. And that's what leads to

1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:18.160
 this computational irreducibility idea, because the reason we don't get to jump ahead, you know,

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:23.360
 and outthink rule 30, is because we're just computationally equivalent to rule 30. So we're

1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:29.520
 kind of just both just running computations that are the same sort of raw, the same level of

1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:34.800
 computation, so to speak. So that's kind of the, the idea there. And the question, I mean, it's,

1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:41.120
 it's like, the, you know, in, in the science fiction version would be, okay, somebody says,

1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:46.880
 we just need more servers, get us more servers. The way to get even more servers is, turn the whole

1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:53.440
 planet into a bunch of microservers. And that that's, that's where it starts. And so the question of,

1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:57.520
 you know, computational equivalence principle of computational equivalence is, well, actually,

1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:05.280
 you don't need to build those custom servers. Actually, you can, you can just use natural

1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:10.880
 computation to compute things, so to speak, you can use nature to compute, you don't need to have

1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:15.840
 done all that engineering. And it's kind of the, it's kind of feels a little disappointing that

1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:19.120
 you say, we're going to build all these servers, we're going to do all these things, we're going

1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:23.920
 to make, you know, maybe we're going to have human consciousness uploaded into, you know,

1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:28.480
 some elaborate digital environment. And then you look at that thing, and you say it's got electrons

1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:33.600
 moving around, just like in a rock. And then you say, well, what's the difference? And the principle

1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:39.200
 of computational equivalence says, there isn't, at some level, a fundamental, you know, you can't

1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:45.440
 say mathematically, there's a fundamental difference between the rock that is the future of human

1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:51.200
 consciousness, and the rock that's just a rock. Now, what I've sort of realized with this kind of

1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:57.840
 consciousness thing is, there is, there is an aspect of this that seems to be more special,

1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:03.280
 that isn't, and for example, something I haven't really teased apart properly, is when it comes to

1:05:03.280 --> 1:05:07.280
 something like the weather and the weather having a mind of its own or whatever, or your average,

1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:13.520
 you know, pulsar magnetosphere acting like a sort of intelligent thing. How does that relate to,

1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:20.640
 you know, how, how does, how is that, that entity related to the kind of consciousness that we have

1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:25.200
 and sort of what would the world look like, you know, to the weather? If we think about the weather

1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:30.880
 as a mind, what will it perceive? What will it laws, its laws of physics be? I don't really know.

1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:37.200
 Because it's very parallel. It's very parallel, among other things. And it, it, it's not obvious.

1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:41.760
 I mean, this is a really kind of mind bending thing, because we've got to try and imagine

1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:46.720
 where, you know, we've got to try and imagine a parsing of the universe different from the one

1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:51.760
 we have. And by the way, when we think about extraterrestrial intelligence and so on,

1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:57.040
 I think that's kind of the key thing is, you know, we've always assumed, I've always assumed,

1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:01.680
 okay, the extraterrestrials, at least they have the same physics, we all live in the same universe,

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:07.200
 they've got the same physics. But actually, that's not really right, because the extraterrestrials

1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:12.560
 could have a completely different way of parsing that the universe. So it's as if, you know,

1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:16.800
 there could be for all we know, right here in this room, you know, in the, in the details of the

1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:22.880
 motion of these gas molecules, there could be an amazing intelligence that we were like, but we

1:06:22.880 --> 1:06:28.000
 have no way of we're not parsing the universe in the same way. If only we could parse the

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:33.200
 universe in the right way, you know, immediately this amazing thing that's going on and this,

1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:37.040
 you know, huge culture that's developed and all that kind of thing would be obvious to us, but

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:39.680
 it's not because we have our particular way of parsing the universe.

1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:45.040
 Would that thing also have us agency? I don't know the right word to use, but something like

1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:47.360
 consciousness, but a different kind of consciousness?

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:51.600
 I think it's a question of just what you mean by the word, because I think that the, you know,

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:57.040
 this notion of consciousness and the, okay, so some people think of consciousness as sort of a key

1:06:57.040 --> 1:07:04.560
 aspect of it is that we feel that the sort of a feeling of, that we exist in some way, that we

1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:12.000
 have this intrinsic feeling about ourselves. You know, I suspect that any of these things would

1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:16.000
 also have an intrinsic feeling about themselves. I've been sort of trying to think recently

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.720
 about constructing an experiment about what if you were just a piece of a cellular automaton,

1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:25.680
 let's say, you know, what would your feeling about yourself actually be? And, you know,

1:07:25.680 --> 1:07:31.440
 can we put ourselves in the, in the shoes, in the cells of the cellular automaton, so to speak?

1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:36.960
 Can we, can we get ourselves close enough to that, that we could have a sense of what the world

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:42.560
 would be like if you were operating in that way? And it's a little difficult because, you know,

1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:47.360
 you have to not only think about what are you perceiving, but also what's actually going on

1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:52.640
 in your brain. And our brains do what they actually do. And they don't, it's, you know,

1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:57.360
 I think there might be some experiments that are possible with, with, you know, neural nets and so

1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:02.080
 on, where you can have something where you can at least see in detail what's happening inside the

1:08:02.080 --> 1:08:07.200
 system. And I've been sort of one of the, one of my projects to think about is, is there a way of

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:13.840
 kind of, kind of getting a sense, kind of from inside the system about what its view of the world

1:08:13.840 --> 1:08:19.680
 is and how it, how it, you know, can, can we make a bridge? See, the main issue is this,

1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:24.160
 what, where, you know, it's a, it's a sort of philosophically difficult thing because

1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:29.280
 it's like, we do what we do, we understand ourselves, at least to some extent.

1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:30.800
 We humans understand ourselves.

1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:35.840
 That's correct. And, but yet, okay, so what are we trying to do? For example, when we are trying

1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:40.160
 to make a model of physics, what are we actually trying to do? Because, you know, you say, well,

1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:44.160
 can we work out what the universe does? Well, of course, we can, we just watch the universe,

1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:48.640
 the universe does what it does. But what we're trying to do when we make a model of physics

1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:54.160
 is we're trying to get to the point where we can tell a story to ourselves that we understand

1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:58.560
 that is also a representation of what the universe does. So it's this kind of, you know,

1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:03.440
 can we make a bridge between what we humans can understand in our minds and what the universe

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:10.640
 does. And in a sense, you know, a large part of my kind of life efforts have been devoted to

1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:15.200
 making computational language, which kind of is a bridge between what is possible in the

1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:20.880
 computational universe, and what we humans can conceptualize and think about in a sense what,

1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:25.360
 you know, when I built Wolfman language and our whole sort of computational language story,

1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:30.560
 it's all about how do you take sort of raw computation and this ocean of computational

1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:37.040
 possibility, and how do we sort of represent pieces of it in a way that we humans can understand

1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:41.920
 and that map on to things that we care about doing. And in a sense, when you add physics,

1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:46.240
 you're adding this other piece where we can, you know, mediated by computer,

1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:51.040
 can we get physics to the point where we humans can understand something about what's

1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:56.160
 happening in it. And when we talk about an alien intelligence, it's kind of the same story. It's

1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:02.640
 like, is there a way of mapping what's happening there onto something that we humans can understand?

1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:09.920
 And, you know, physics, in some sense, is like our exhibit one of the story of alien intelligence.

1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:15.600
 It's a, you know, it's an alien intelligence in some sense. And what we're doing in making a

1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:21.280
 model of physics is mapping that onto something that we understand. And I think, you know, a lot

1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:25.840
 of these other things that have I've recently been kind of studying, whether it's molecular

1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:32.800
 biology, other kinds of things, which we can talk about a bit. Those are other cases where we're,

1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:37.680
 in a sense, trying to, again, make that bridge between what we humans understand

1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:42.160
 and sort of the natural language of that sort of alien intelligence in some sense.

1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:47.440
 When you're talking about just to backtrack a little bit about cellular automata,

1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:56.000
 being able to, what's it like to be a cellular automata in the way that's equivalent to what

1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:04.320
 is it like to be a conscious human being? How do you approach that? So is it looking at some

1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:10.800
 subset of the cellular automata, asking questions of that subset, like how the world is perceived,

1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:19.040
 how you, as that subset, like for that local pocket of computation, what are you able to say

1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:25.760
 about the broader cellular type? And that somehow then can give you a sense of how to step outside

1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:32.400
 of that cellular automata. Right. But the tricky part is that that little subset, it's what it's

1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:39.120
 doing is it has a view of itself. And the question is, how do you get inside it? It's like, you know,

1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:44.080
 when we, with humans, right, it's like, we can't get inside each other's consciousness.

1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:49.680
 That doesn't really, you know, that doesn't really even make sense. It's like, there is an

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:54.800
 experience that somebody is having, but you can perceive things from the outside, but sort of

1:11:54.800 --> 1:12:00.640
 getting inside it, it doesn't quite make sense. And for me, these sort of philosophical issues,

1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:06.960
 and this one I have not untangled. So let's be, for me, the thing that has been really

1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:11.040
 interesting in thinking through some of these things is, you know, when it comes to questions

1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:16.000
 about consciousness or whatever else, it's like, when I can run a program and actually

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.960
 see pictures and, you know, make things concrete, I have a much better chance to understand what's

1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:24.640
 going on than when I'm just trying to reason about things in a very abstract way.

1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:32.720
 Yeah, but there may be a way to map the program to your conscious experience. So for example,

1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:39.760
 when you play a video game, you do a first person shooter, you walk around inside this entity.

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:44.720
 It's a very different thing than watching this entity. So if you can somehow connect,

1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:51.200
 more and more connect this, this full conscious experience to the subset of the cellular automata.

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:54.560
 Yeah, it's something like that. But the difference in the first person shooter thing is there's

1:12:54.560 --> 1:13:00.720
 still your brain and your memory is still remembering, you know, you, you still have,

1:13:00.720 --> 1:13:06.560
 it's hard to, I mean, again, what one's going to get, one is not going to actually be able to

1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:10.800
 be the cellular automaton. One's going to be able to watch what the cellular automaton does.

1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:15.520
 But this is the frustrating thing that I'm trying to understand, you know, how to,

1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:18.080
 how to think about being it, so to speak.

1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:22.000
 Okay, so like in virtual reality, there's a concept of immersion, like with anything,

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.560
 with video game, with books, there's a concept of immersion. It feels like over time,

1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:32.720
 if the virtual reality experience is well done, and maybe in the future it'll be extremely well

1:13:32.720 --> 1:13:41.040
 done, the immersion leads you to feel like you mentioned memories, you forget that you even

1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:47.280
 ever existed outside that experience. It's so immersive. I mean, you could argue sort of mathematically

1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:53.360
 that you can never truly become immersed, but maybe you can. I mean, why can't you merge with

1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:59.360
 the cellular automaton? I mean, aren't you just part of the same fabric? Why can't you just like...

1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:03.280
 Well, that's a good question. I mean, so let's imagine the following scenario, let's imagine...

1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:03.840
 Then can you return?

1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:07.040
 But then can you return back?

1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:10.640
 Well, yeah, right. I mean, it's like, let's imagine you've uploaded, you know, your brain

1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:16.560
 is scanned, you've got every synapse, you know, mapped out, you upload everything about you,

1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:21.440
 the brain simulator, you upload the brain simulator, and the brain simulator is basically,

1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:26.320
 you know, some glorified cellular automaton. And then you say, well, now we've got an answer to

1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:32.160
 what does it feel like to be a cellular automaton? It feels just like it felt to be ordinary you,

1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:36.560
 because they're both computational systems, and they're both, you know, operating in the same way.

1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:41.440
 So in a sense, but I think there's somehow more to it, because in that sense, when you're just

1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:46.880
 making a brain simulator, it's just, you know, we're just saying there's another version of our

1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:52.000
 consciousness. The question that we're asking is, if we tease away from our consciousness,

1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:56.480
 and get to something that is different, how do we make a bridge to understanding what's going on

1:14:56.480 --> 1:15:01.360
 there? And, you know, there's a way of thinking about this. Okay, so this is coming on to sort

1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:05.920
 of questions about the existence of the universe and so on. But one of the things is there's this

1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:12.240
 notion that we have of rural space. So we have this idea of this physical space, which is, you

1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:17.200
 know, something you can move around in that's associated with the actual, the extent of the

1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:22.480
 spatial hypergraph, then there's what we call branchial space, the space of quantum branches.

1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:28.000
 So in this thing we call the multiway graph of all of this sort of branching histories,

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:32.560
 there's this idea of a kind of space where instead of moving around in physical space,

1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:36.560
 you're moving from history to history, so to speak, from one possible history to another

1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:42.160
 possible history. And that's kind of a different kind of space that is the space in which quantum

1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:48.400
 mechanics plays out. Quantum mechanics, like for example, oh, something like, I think we're slowly

1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:52.960
 understanding things like destructive interference in quantum mechanics, that what's happening is

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:57.840
 branchial space is associated with phase and quantum mechanics. And what's happening is the

1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:02.400
 two photons that are supposed to be interfering and destructively interfering are winding up

1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:07.520
 at different ends of branchial space. And so us as these poor observers that are trying to,

1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:12.880
 that have branching brains that are trying to conflate together these different threads of history

1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:16.720
 and say, we've really got a consistent story that we're telling here, we're really knitting

1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:21.520
 together these threads of history by the time the two photons wound up at opposite ends of

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:27.360
 branchial space, we just can't knit them together to tell a consistent story. So for us, that's

1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:31.920
 sort of the analog of destructive interference. Got it. And then there's rural space too,

1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:38.080
 which is the space of rules. Yes. Well, that's another level up. So there's the question.

1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:42.880
 Actually, I do want to mention one thing, because it's something I've realized in recent times,

1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:46.640
 and it's, I think it's really, really kind of cool, which is about time dilation and

1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:51.520
 relativity. And it kind of helps to understand, it's something that kind of helps in understanding

1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:58.240
 what's going on. So according to relativity, if you have a clock, it's taking at a certain rate,

1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:03.040
 you send it in a spacecraft that's going at some significant fraction of the speed of light,

1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:10.000
 to you as an observer at rest, that clock that's in the spacecraft will seem to be ticking much

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:16.640
 more slowly. And so in other words, it's kind of like the twin who goes off to Alpha Centauri

1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:22.480
 and goes very fast will age much less than the twin who's on Earth that is just hanging out

1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:29.360
 where they're hanging out. Okay, why does that happen? Okay, so it has to do with what motion is. So

1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:34.880
 in in our models of physics, what is motion? Well, when you move from somewhere to somewhere,

1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:41.600
 it's you're having to sort of recreate yourself at a different place in space. When you exist at

1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:46.080
 a particular place, and you just evolve with time, you're again, you're updating yourself,

1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:51.200
 you're you're following these rules to update what happens. Well, so the question is when you

1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:55.440
 have a certain amount of computation in you, so to speak, when there's a certain amount,

1:17:55.440 --> 1:17:59.760
 you know, you're computing the universe is computing at a certain rate, you can either use

1:17:59.760 --> 1:18:05.600
 that computation to work out sitting still where you are, what's going to happen successfully in

1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:11.440
 time, or you can use that computation to recreate yourself as you move around the universe. And so

1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:16.400
 time dilation ends up being, it's really cool, actually, that this is explainable in a in a way

1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:21.760
 that isn't just imagine the mathematics of relativity. But that time dilation is a story

1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:27.840
 of the fact that as you kind of are recreating yourself as you move, you are using up some

1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:33.120
 of your computation. And so you don't have as much computation left over to actually work out what

1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:38.880
 happens progressively with time. So that means that time is running more slowly for you, because

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:45.360
 it is you're you're using up your computation, your clock can't tick as quickly, because every

1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:50.080
 tick of the clock is using up some computation, but you already use that computation up on moving at,

1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:54.800
 you know, half the speed of light or something. And so that's that's why time dilation happens.

1:18:55.520 --> 1:19:00.240
 And so you can you can start so it's kind of interesting that one can sort of get an intuition

1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:05.120
 about something like that, because it has seemed like just a mathematical fact about the mathematics

1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:10.160
 of special relativity and so on. Well, for me, it's a little bit confusing what the you in that

1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:19.280
 picture is, because you're using up computation. Okay, so so we're simply saying the entity is

1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:25.040
 updating itself according to the way that the universe updates itself. And the question is,

1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:31.120
 you're, you know, those updates, let's imagine the you as a clock. Okay. And the clock is, you

1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:35.840
 know, there's all these little updates, the hypergraph and a sequence of updates cause the

1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:41.440
 pendulum to swing back the other way, and then swing back, swinging back and forth. Okay. And

1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:47.040
 all of the all of those updates are contributing to the motion of, you know, the pendulum going

1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:52.640
 back and forth or the little oscillator moving, whatever it is. Okay. But but then the alternative

1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:57.920
 is that sort of situation one, where the thing is at rest, situation two, where it's kind of moving

1:19:58.480 --> 1:20:04.160
 the the what's happening is, it is having to recreate itself at every, at every moment,

1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:10.240
 the thing is going to have to do the computations to be able to sort of recreate itself at a

1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:15.120
 different position in space. And that's kind of the intuition behind. So it's either going to

1:20:15.120 --> 1:20:19.760
 spend its computation, recreating itself at a different position in space, or it's going to

1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:27.520
 spend its computation doing the sort of doing the updating of the, you know, of the ticking of the

1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:33.360
 clock, so to speak. So the more updating is doing the less the ticking of the clock updates doing.

1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:37.360
 That's right. The more it has having to update because of motion, yeah, the less it can update

1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:42.880
 the clock. So that that's, I mean, obviously, there's a there's a sort of mathematical version

1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:47.440
 of it that relates to how it actually works in relativity. But that's kind of, to me, that

1:20:47.440 --> 1:20:53.120
 was sort of exciting to me that it's possible to have a really mechanically explainable story there

1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:57.520
 that that isn't, and it's similarly in quantum mechanics, this notion of branching brains,

1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:02.080
 perceiving branching universes. To me, that's getting towards a sort of mechanically explainable

1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:05.760
 version of what happens in quantum mechanics, even though it's a little bit mind bending,

1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:12.080
 to see, you know, these things about under what circumstances can you successfully knit together

1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:17.200
 those different threads of history, and when do things sort of escape, and those kinds of things.

1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:24.160
 But the, you know, the thing about this physical space and physical space, the the main sort of

1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:28.960
 big theory is general relativity, the theory of gravity. And that tells you how things move in

1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:34.240
 physical space. In branching space, the big theory is the Feynman path integral, which,

1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:39.840
 it turns out, tells you essentially how things move in quantum, in the space of quantum phases.

1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:45.120
 So it's kind of like motion in branching space. And it's kind of a fun thing to start thinking

1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:51.280
 about what, oh, you know, all these things that we know in physical space, like event horizons

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:55.360
 and black holes and so on, what are the analogous things in branching space, for example, the speed

1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:59.840
 of light, what's the analog of the speed of light in branching space, it's the maximum speed of

1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:06.320
 quantum entanglement. So the speed of light is a flash bulb goes off here, what's the maximum

1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:13.280
 rate at which the effect of that flash bulb is detectable moving away in space. So similarly,

1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:18.320
 in branching space, something happens. And the question is, how far in this branching space,

1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:23.760
 in the space of quantum states, how far away can that get within a certain period of time.

1:22:23.760 --> 1:22:28.720
 And so there's this notion of a maximum entanglement speed. And that might be observable,

1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:32.800
 that's the thing we've been sort of poking at, is might there be a way to observe it,

1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:38.240
 even in some atomic physics kind of situation. Because one of the things that's weird in quantum

1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:43.760
 mechanics is we're, you know, when we study quantum mechanics, we mostly study it in terms

1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:48.000
 of small numbers of particles, you know, this electron does this, this thing on an ion trap

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:52.320
 does that and so on. But when we deal with large numbers of particles, kind of all bets are off,

1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:57.200
 it's kind of too complicated to deal with quantum mechanics. And so what ends up happening is,

1:22:57.200 --> 1:23:02.320
 so this question about maximum entanglement speed and things like that may actually play

1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:07.520
 in one of these, in the sort of story of many body quantum mechanics, and even have some suspicions

1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:13.440
 about things that might happen, even in one of the things I realized I'd never understood,

1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:18.320
 and it's kind of embarrassing, but I think I now understand a little better, is when you have chemistry

1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:23.120
 and you have quantum mechanics, it's like, well, there's two carbon atoms as this molecule and

1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:28.000
 we do a reaction, and we draw a diagram and we say this carbon atom ends up in this place.

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:31.760
 And it's like, but wait a minute, in quantum mechanics, nothing ends up in a definite place.

1:23:31.760 --> 1:23:35.600
 There's always just some wave function for this to happen. How can it be the case

1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:39.840
 that we can draw these reasonable, it just ended up in this place. And you have to kind of say,

1:23:39.840 --> 1:23:44.800
 well, the environment of the molecule effectively made a bunch of measurements on the molecule

1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:48.880
 to keep it kind of classical. And that's a story that has to do with

1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:55.360
 this whole thing about, you know, measurements have to do with this idea of, you know, can we

1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:59.600
 conclude that something definite happened? Because in quantum mechanics, the intrinsic

1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:03.040
 quantum mechanics, the mathematics of quantum mechanics is all about, they're just these

1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:08.080
 amplitudes for different things to happen. Then there's this thing of, and then we make a measurement,

1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:12.080
 and we conclude that something definite happened. And that has to do with this thing,

1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:17.200
 I think, about sort of moving about knitting together these different threads of history

1:24:17.200 --> 1:24:21.200
 and saying, this is now something where we can definitively say something definite happened.

1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:25.840
 In the traditional theory of quantum mechanics, it's just like, you know, after you've done

1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:30.560
 all this amplitude computation, then this big hammer comes down, and you do a measurement,

1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:34.640
 and it's all over. And that's been very confusing. For example, in quantum computing,

1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:38.720
 it's been a very confusing thing. Because when you say, you know, in quantum computing,

1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:43.200
 the basic idea is you're going to use all these separate threads of computation, so to speak,

1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:46.800
 to do all the different parts of, you know, try these different factors for an integer or

1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:51.120
 something like this. And it looks like you can do a lot because you've got all these different

1:24:51.120 --> 1:24:56.080
 threads going on. But then you have to say, well, at the end of it, you've got all these threads,

1:24:56.080 --> 1:25:00.880
 and every thread came up with a definite answer, but we got to conflate those together to figure

1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:05.760
 out a definite thing that we humans can take away from it, a definite so the computer actually

1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:13.360
 produced this output. So having this branchial space and this hypergraph model of physics,

1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:19.520
 do you think it's possible to then make predictions that are definite about many body

1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:24.720
 quantum mechanical systems? Is that the hope? I think it's likely, yes. But I don't, you know,

1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:29.120
 this is every one of these things, when you, when you go from the underlying theory, which is

1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:34.000
 complicated enough, and it's, I mean, the theory at some level is beautifully simple. But as soon

1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:38.000
 as you start actually trying to, it's this whole question about how do you bridge it to things

1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:43.840
 that we humans can talk about? It gets really complicated. And this thing about actually getting

1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:50.000
 it to a definite prediction about, you know, definite thing you can say about chemistry

1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.840
 or something like this, you know, that's just a lot of work. So I'll give you an example.

1:25:53.840 --> 1:25:59.920
 There's a thing called the quantum Zeno effect. So the idea is, you know, quantum stuff happens,

1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:06.080
 but then if you make a measurement, you're kind of freezing time in quantum mechanics. And so it

1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:11.040
 looks like there's a possibility that with sort of the relationship between the quantum Zeno effect

1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:16.560
 and the way that many body quantum mechanics works and so on, maybe just conceivably, it may be

1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:22.320
 possible to actually figure out a way to measure the maximum entanglement speed. And the reason we

1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:27.760
 can potentially do that is because the systems we deal with in terms of atoms and things, they're

1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:33.040
 pretty big, you know, a mole of atoms is, you know, is a lot of atoms. And, you know, but it isn't a

1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:37.680
 very, you know, it's something where to get, you know, when we're dealing with how can you see 10

1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:43.680
 to the minus 100, so to speak, well, by the time you've got, you know, 10 to the 30th atoms, you're

1:26:43.680 --> 1:26:48.640
 not, you know, you're within a little bit closer striking distance of that. It's not like, oh,

1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:54.400
 we've just got, you know, two atoms, and we're trying to see down to 10 to the minus 100 meters

1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:59.920
 or whatever. So I don't know how it will work, but this is a, this is a potential direction.

1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:04.720
 And if you can tell, by the way, if we could measure the maximum entanglement speed, we would

1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:10.560
 know the elementary length. These are all related. So if we got that one number, we just need one

1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:15.120
 number, if we can get that one number, we can, you know, the theory has no parameters anymore.

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:21.040
 And, you know, there are other places, well, there's another hope for doing that,

1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:26.240
 is in cosmology. In this model, one of the features is the universe is not fixed dimensional.

1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:29.920
 I mean, we think we live in three dimensional space, but this hypergraph doesn't have any

1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:36.000
 particular dimension. It can emerge as something which on an approximation, it's as if, you know,

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:40.720
 you say, what's the volume of a sphere in the hypergraph where a sphere is defined as

1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:44.480
 how many nodes do you get to when you go a distance r away from a given point?

1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:51.120
 And you can say, well, if I get to about r cube nodes, when I go a distance r away in the

1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:55.920
 hypergraph, then I'm living roughly in three dimensional space. But you might also get to r

1:27:55.920 --> 1:28:03.200
 to the point, you know, 2.92, you know, for some value of r in, you know, as r increases,

1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:08.000
 that might be the sort of fit to what happens. And so one of the things we suspect is that

1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:14.240
 the very early universe was essentially infinite dimensional. And that as the universe expanded,

1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:19.680
 it became lower dimensional. And so one of the things that is another little sort of point

1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:24.240
 where we think there might be a way to actually measure some things is dimension fluctuations

1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:29.600
 in the early universe. That is, is there a, is there leftover dimension fluctuation of

1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:33.280
 at the time of the cosmic microwave background, 100,000 years or something after the beginning

1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:37.840
 of the universe? Is it still the case that there are, there were pieces of the universe

1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:43.280
 that didn't have dimension three, that had dimension 3.01 or something? And can we tell that?

1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:51.040
 Is that possible to observe fluctuations in dimensions? I don't even know what that entails.

1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:56.400
 Okay, so the question, which should be an elementary exercise in electrodynamics,

1:28:56.400 --> 1:29:02.080
 except it isn't, is understanding what happens to a photon when it propagates through 3.01

1:29:02.080 --> 1:29:07.440
 dimensional space. So for example, the inverse square law is a consequence of the, you know,

1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:14.800
 the surface area of a sphere is proportional to R squared. But if you're not in three dimensional

1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:21.280
 space, the surface area of sphere is not proportional to R squared, it's R to the whatever, 2.01

1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:28.480
 or something. And so that means that I think when you kind of try and do optics, you know,

1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:33.520
 a common principle in optics is Huygens principle, which basically says that every piece of a

1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:40.880
 wave front of light is a source of new spherical waves. And those spherical waves, if they're

1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:46.960
 different dimensional spherical waves, will have other characteristics. And so there will be bizarre

1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:53.600
 optical phenomena, which we haven't figured out yet. So you're looking for some weird

1:29:53.600 --> 1:30:01.360
 photon trajectories that designate that it's 3.01 dimensional space? Yeah. Yeah, that would be an

1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:04.960
 example of, I mean, you know, there are there are only a certain number of things we can measure

1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:09.360
 about photons, you know, we can measure their polarization, we can measure their frequency,

1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:14.880
 we can measure their direction, those kinds of things. And, you know, how that all works out.

1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:21.360
 And, you know, in the current models of physics, you know, it's been hard to explain how the

1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:27.760
 universe manages to be as uniform as it is. And that's led to this inflation idea that to the

1:30:27.760 --> 1:30:32.560
 great annoyance of my then collaborator, I we had, we figured out in like 1979, we had this

1:30:32.560 --> 1:30:36.880
 realization that you could get something like this. But it seemed implausible that that's the

1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:42.720
 way the universe worked. So we put in a footnote. And that was, so that's a, but in any case, I've

1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:47.840
 never really completely believed it. But this, that's an idea for how to sort of puff out the

1:30:47.840 --> 1:30:52.320
 universe faster than the speed of light, early moments of the universe, that that's the sort of

1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:58.800
 the inflation idea. And that you can somehow explain how the universe manages to be as uniform as it

1:30:58.800 --> 1:31:04.960
 is. In our model, this turns out to be much more natural, because the universe just starts very

1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:10.560
 connected, the hypergraph is not such that the ball that you grow starting from a single point has

1:31:10.560 --> 1:31:18.320
 volume r cubed, it might have volume r to the 500 or r to the infinity. And so that means that you

1:31:18.320 --> 1:31:22.560
 sort of naturally get this much higher degree of connectivity and uniformity in the universe.

1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:28.080
 And then the question is, this is sort of the mathematical physics challenge is in the standard

1:31:28.080 --> 1:31:32.320
 theory of the universe, there's the Friedman, Roberts and Walker universe, which is the kind

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:36.960
 of standard model where the universe is isotropic and homogeneous. And you can then work out the

1:31:36.960 --> 1:31:41.760
 equations of general relativity, and you can figure out how the universe expands. We would like to do

1:31:41.760 --> 1:31:46.960
 the same kind of thing, including dimension change. This is just difficult mathematical physics.

1:31:46.960 --> 1:31:53.840
 I mean, the fundamental reason it's difficult, when people invented calculus 300 years ago,

1:31:53.840 --> 1:31:59.840
 calculus was the story of understanding change and change as a function of a variable.

1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:04.480
 And so people study univariate calculus, they study multivariate calculus, it's one variable,

1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:11.680
 it's two variables, three variables, but whoever studied 2.5 variable calculus turns out nobody.

1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:17.200
 It turns out that, but what we need to have to understand these fractional dimensional

1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:24.880
 spaces, which don't work like, well, they're spaces where the effective dimension is not

1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:30.560
 an integer. So you can't apply the tools of calculus and natural and easily to fractional

1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:31.440
 dimensions? No.

1:32:31.440 --> 1:32:35.920
 So somebody has to figure out how to do that. Yeah, we're trying to figure this out. I mean,

1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:40.720
 it's very interesting. I mean, it's very connected to very frontier issues in mathematics,

1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:46.880
 it's very beautiful. So is it possible, we're dealing with a scale that's so,

1:32:46.880 --> 1:32:53.520
 so much smaller than our human scale, is it possible to make predictions versus explanations?

1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:58.800
 Do you have a hope that with this hypergraph model, you'd be able to make predictions?

1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:05.520
 That that could be validated with a physics experiment, predictions that couldn't have

1:33:05.520 --> 1:33:10.960
 been done or weren't done otherwise. In which domain do you think?

1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:14.640
 Okay, so they're going to be cosmology ones to do with dimension fluctuations in the universe.

1:33:14.640 --> 1:33:19.440
 That's a very bizarre effect. Dimension fluctuation is just something nobody ever looked for that.

1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:25.040
 If anybody sees dimension fluctuation, that's a huge flag, that's something like our model

1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:32.160
 is going on. And how one detects that, that's a problem of traditional physics,

1:33:32.160 --> 1:33:37.120
 in a sense of what's the best way to actually figure that out. And for example, that's one,

1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:44.400
 there are all kinds of things one can imagine. I mean, there are things that in black hole mergers,

1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:49.440
 it's possible that there will be effects of maximum entanglement speed in large black hole

1:33:49.440 --> 1:33:54.720
 mergers. That's another possible thing. And all of that is detected through,

1:33:54.720 --> 1:33:59.360
 like what, do you have a hope for a LIGO type of situation, like that's gravitational waves?

1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:06.560
 Yeah, or alternatively, I mean, I think it's, look, figuring out experiments is like

1:34:06.560 --> 1:34:11.040
 figuring out technology inventions. That is, you've got a set of raw materials,

1:34:11.040 --> 1:34:15.280
 you've got an underlying model, and now you've got to be very clever to figure out,

1:34:15.280 --> 1:34:20.400
 what is that thing I can measure that just somehow leverages into the right place.

1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:27.120
 And we've spent less effort on that than I would have liked, because one of the reasons is that

1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:34.160
 I think that the physicists who've been working on our models, we've now lots of physicists,

1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:39.040
 actually, it's very, very nice. It's kind of, it's one of these cases where I'm almost,

1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:43.600
 I'm really kind of pleasantly surprised that the sort of absorption of the things we've done

1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:48.720
 has been quite rapid and quite sort of very positive.

1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:51.760
 So it's a camber and explosion of physicists too, and not just ideas.

1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:57.200
 Yes, I mean, you know, a lot of what's happened, that's really interesting. And again, not what

1:34:57.200 --> 1:35:03.200
 I expected is there are a lot of areas of sort of very elaborate, sophisticated mathematical

1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:08.240
 physics, whether that's causal set theory, whether it's higher category theory, whether it's

1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:13.120
 categorical quantum mechanics, all sorts of elaborate names for these things, spin networks,

1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:19.760
 perhaps, you know, causal dynamical triangulations, all kinds of names of these fields. And these

1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:24.480
 fields have a bunch of good mathematical physicists in them, who've been working for decades in

1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:29.680
 these particular areas. And the question is, but they've been building these mathematical

1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:34.240
 structures. And the mathematical structures are interesting, but they don't typically sit on

1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:39.360
 anything. They're just mathematical structures. And I think what's happened is our models provide

1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:44.800
 kind of a machine code that lives underneath those models. So a typical example, this is

1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:50.480
 a due to Jonathan Gorod, who's one of the key people who's been working on a project.

1:35:51.280 --> 1:35:56.160
 This is in, okay, so I'll give you an example just to give a sense of how these things connect.

1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:02.880
 This is in causal set theory. So the idea of causal set theory is there are, in space time,

1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:08.160
 we imagine that there's space and time, it's a three plus one dimensional, you know, set up,

1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:14.640
 we imagine that there are just events that happen at different times and places in space and time.

1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:19.680
 And the idea of causal set theory is the only thing you say about the universe is there are

1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:24.800
 a bunch of events that happen sort of randomly at different places in space and time. And then

1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:30.480
 the whole sort of theory of physics has to be to do with this graph of causal relationships

1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:36.880
 between these randomly thrown down events. So they've always been confused by the fact that

1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:41.680
 to get even Lorentz invariance, even relativistic invariance, you need a very special way to throw

1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:46.640
 down those events. And they've had no natural way to understand how that would happen. So what

1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:54.240
 Jonathan figured out is that, in fact, from our models, they instead of just generating events at

1:36:54.240 --> 1:37:01.200
 random, our models necessarily generate events in some pattern in space time effectively, that

1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:05.280
 then leads to Lorentz invariance and relativistic invariance and all those kinds of things. So it's

1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:09.440
 a place where all the mathematics that's been done on, well, we just have a random collection of

1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:15.520
 events. Now, what consequences does that have in terms of causal set theory and so on, that can

1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:21.520
 all be kind of wheeled in now that we have some different underlying foundational idea for what

1:37:21.520 --> 1:37:26.400
 the particular distribution of events is as opposed to just what we throw down random events.

1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:32.160
 And so that's a typical sort of example of what we're seeing in all these different areas of kind

1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:36.480
 of how you can take really interesting things that have been done in mathematical physics

1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:43.440
 and connect them. And it's really kind of beautiful because the abstract models we have

1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:48.800
 just seem to plug into all these different very interesting, very elegant abstract ideas. But

1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:54.960
 we're now giving sort of a reason for that to be the way, a reason for one to care. I mean,

1:37:54.960 --> 1:38:01.680
 it's like saying, you can think about computation abstractly. You can think about, I don't know,

1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:06.320
 combinators or something as abstract computational things. And you can sort of do all kinds of

1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:10.880
 study of them. But it's like, why do we care? Well, okay, Turing machines are a good start

1:38:10.880 --> 1:38:14.320
 because you can kind of see that sort of mechanically doing things. But when we actually

1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:19.520
 start thinking about computers, computing things, we have a really good reason to care. And this

1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:23.920
 is sort of what we're what we're providing, I think, is a reason to care about a lot of these

1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:28.640
 areas of mathematical physics. So that's been, that's been very nice. So I'm not sure we've

1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:33.120
 ever got to the question of why does the universe exist at all?

1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:35.120
 No, let's talk about that. Yes.

1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:41.440
 So we're, it's not the simplest question in the world. So it takes a few steps to get to it.

1:38:41.440 --> 1:38:45.920
 And it's nevertheless even surprising that you can even begin to answer this question,

1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:53.360
 as you were saying. I'm very surprised. So the next thing to perhaps understand is this idea

1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:59.520
 of rural space. So we've got kind of physical space, we've got bronchial space, the space of

1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:04.960
 possible quantum histories. And now we've got another level of kind of abstraction, which is

1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:11.040
 rural space. And here's the, here's where that comes from. So you say, okay, you say we've got

1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:16.400
 this model for the universe, we've got a particular rule, and we run this rule, and we get the

1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:22.480
 universe. Okay, so that's, that's interesting. Why that rule? Why not another rule? And so that

1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:28.560
 confused me for a long time. And I realized, well, actually, what if the thing could be

1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:34.640
 using all possible rules? What if at every step, in addition to saying apply a particular rule

1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:39.600
 at all places in this hypergraph, one could say, just take all possible rules and apply

1:39:39.600 --> 1:39:44.560
 all possible rules at all possible places in this hypergraph. Okay. And then you make this

1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:50.480
 rural multiway graph, which both is all possible histories for a particular rule and all possible

1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:55.440
 rules. So the next thing you'd say is, how can you get anything reasonable? How can anything,

1:39:55.440 --> 1:40:00.800
 you know, real come out of the set of all possible rules applied in all possible ways?

1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:07.200
 Okay, this is a subtle thing. So which I haven't fully untangled. The there is this object,

1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:12.080
 which is the result of running all possible rules in all possible ways. And you might say,

1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:17.040
 if you're running all possible rules, why can't everything possible happen? Well, the answer is

1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:24.720
 because when you there's sort of this entanglement that occurs. So let's say that you have a lot

1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:29.280
 of different possible initial conditions, a lot of different possible states, then you're applying

1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:35.120
 these different rules. Well, some of those rules can end up with the same state. So it isn't the

1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:39.440
 case that you can just get from anywhere to anywhere. There's this whole entangled structure

1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:43.920
 of what can lead to what and there's a definite structure that's produced. I think I'm going

1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:50.560
 to call that definite structure, the RULIAD, the limit of the limits of kind of all possible rules

1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:55.360
 being applied in all possible ways. And you're saying that structure is finite, so that somehow

1:40:55.360 --> 1:41:01.760
 connects to maybe a similar kind of thing as like causal invariance. Well, RULIAD necessarily has

1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:06.400
 causal invariance. That's a feature of that's just a mathematical consequence of essentially

1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:12.000
 using all possible rules, plus universal computation gives you the fact that from any

1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.280
 diverging paths you can always, the paths will always convert.

1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:20.960
 But does that necessarily infer that the RULIAD is a finite?

1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:27.920
 In the end, it's not necessarily finite. I mean, it's just like the history of the universe may

1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:32.240
 not be finite. The history of the universe, time may keep going forever. You can keep running the

1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:37.680
 computations of the RULIAD and you'll keep spewing out more and more and more structure. It's like

1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:46.480
 time doesn't have to end. But the issue is there are three limits that happen in this RULIAD object.

1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:51.360
 One is how long you run the computation for. Another is how many different rules you're

1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:56.960
 applying. Another is how many different states you start from. And the mixture of those three

1:41:56.960 --> 1:42:02.720
 limits, I mean, this is just mathematically a horrendous object. And what's interesting about

1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:07.280
 this object is the one thing that does seem to be the case about this object is it connects

1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:12.080
 with ideas in higher category theory. And in particular, it connects to some of the 20th

1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:17.760
 century's most abstract mathematics done by this chap, growth and deke. Growth and deke had a thing

1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:24.240
 called the infinity group void, which is closely related to this RULIAD object. Although the details

1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:31.440
 of the relationship, you know, I don't fully understand yet. But I think that what's interesting

1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:36.320
 is this thing that is sort of this very limiting object. So okay, so a way to think about this,

1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:41.680
 that again, will take us into another direction, which is the equivalence between physics and

1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:49.840
 mathematics. The way that, well, let's see, maybe this is just to give a sense of this kind of

1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:54.320
 group void and things like that, you can think about in mathematics, you can think you have

1:42:54.320 --> 1:43:01.200
 certain axioms, they're kind of like atoms. And you, well, actually, let's say, let's talk about

1:43:01.200 --> 1:43:06.960
 mathematics for a second. So what is mathematics? What is what is it made of, so to speak? Mathematics,

1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:12.960
 there's a bunch of statements like, for addition, x plus y is equal to y plus x, that's a statement

1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:17.440
 of mathematics. Another statement would be, you know, x squared minus one is equal to x plus

1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:21.840
 one x minus one. There are infinite number of these possible statements of mathematics.

1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:27.040
 So it's not, I mean, it's not just I guess a statement, but with x plus y, it's a rule that

1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:34.480
 you can, I mean, you think of it as a rule. It's a, it is a rule. It's also just a thing that is

1:43:34.480 --> 1:43:41.200
 true in mathematics. The statement is true. Right. And what you can imagine is you imagine just

1:43:41.200 --> 1:43:47.280
 laying out this giant kind of ocean of all statements, well, actually, you first start,

1:43:47.280 --> 1:43:51.840
 okay, this is where this was segwaying into a different thing. Let me not go in this direction

1:43:51.840 --> 1:43:56.320
 for a second. Let's not go to meta mathematics just yet. Yeah, we'll maybe get to meta mathematics,

1:43:56.320 --> 1:44:03.040
 but it's, so let me not, let me explain the groupoid and things later. Yes. But so let's

1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:09.280
 come back to the universe, always a good place to be in. So what does the universe have to do

1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:16.880
 with the rule of the all space and how that's possibly connected to why the thing exists at all

1:44:16.880 --> 1:44:22.400
 and why there's just one of them? Yes. Okay. So here's the point. So the thing that had confused

1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:27.520
 me for a long time was, let's say we get the rule for the universe, we hold it in our hand,

1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:31.600
 we say, this is our universe. Then the immediate question is, well, why isn't it another one?

1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:36.960
 And, you know, that's kind of the, you know, the, the sort of the lesson of Copernicus is,

1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:44.320
 we're not very special. So how come we got universe number 312 and not universe quadriline,

1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:48.720
 quadriline, quadriline. And I think the resolution of that is the realization that

1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:56.640
 there, that the universe is running all possible rules. So then you say, well, how on earth do we

1:44:57.440 --> 1:45:01.920
 perceive the universe to be running according to a particular rule? How do we perceive definite

1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:08.000
 things happening in the universe? Well, it's the same story. It's the observer, there is a reference

1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:13.920
 frame that we are picking in this rural space. And that that is what determines our perception

1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:19.840
 of the universe. With our particular sensory information and so on, we are parsing the universe

1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:24.720
 in this particular way. So here's the way to think about it. In, in, in physical space,

1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:29.040
 we live in a particular place in the universe. And, you know, we could live on Alpha Centauri,

1:45:29.040 --> 1:45:36.160
 but we don't, we live here. And similarly, in rural space, we could live in many different

1:45:36.160 --> 1:45:40.960
 places in rural space, but we happen to live here. And what does it mean to live here? It means

1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:46.960
 we have certain sensory input. We have certain ways to parse the universe. Those are our

1:45:46.960 --> 1:45:52.080
 interpretation of the universe. What would it mean to travel in rural space? What it basically

1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:56.960
 means is that we are successively interpreting the universe in different ways. So in other words,

1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:01.920
 to be at a different point in rural space is to have a different, in a sense, a different

1:46:01.920 --> 1:46:07.200
 interpretation of what's going on in the universe. And we can imagine even things like an analog of

1:46:07.200 --> 1:46:12.400
 the speed of light as the maximum speed of translation in rural space and so on.

1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:19.760
 So wait, what's the interpretation? So rural space, we, I'm confused by the we and the

1:46:19.760 --> 1:46:26.960
 interpretation and the universe. I thought moving about in rural space changes the way the universe

1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:35.280
 is, is the way we would perceive it. The way that that ultimately has to do with the perception.

1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:41.760
 So it doesn't real, rural space is not somehow changing, like,

1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:47.840
 branching into another universe, something like that. No, I mean, the point is that the whole

1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:54.800
 point of this is the Rouliat is sort of the encapsulated version of everything that is the

1:46:54.800 --> 1:46:59.840
 universe running according to all possible rules. Yeah, we think of our universe, the observable

1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:07.280
 universe as its thing. So we're a little bit loose with the word universe then, because wouldn't the

1:47:07.280 --> 1:47:14.800
 Rouliat potentially encapsulate a very large number, like combinatorially large, maybe infinite

1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:20.080
 set of what we human physicists think of as universes.

1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:24.800
 That's an interesting, interesting parsing of the word universe, right? Because what we're

1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:28.800
 saying is just as we're at a particular place in physical space, we're at a particular place in

1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:34.800
 rural space. At that particular place in rural space, our experience of the universe is this,

1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:38.400
 just as if we lived at the center of the galaxy, our universe, our experience of the universe

1:47:38.400 --> 1:47:43.920
 will be different from the one it is, given where we actually live. And so in what we're saying is

1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:50.880
 when you might say, I mean, in a sense, this Rouliat is sort of a super universe, so to speak.

1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:56.000
 But it's all entangled together. It's not like you can separate out, you can say,

1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.960
 let me, it's like when we take a reference, okay, it's like our experience of the universe is

1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:05.680
 based on where we are in the universe. We could imagine moving to somewhere else in the universe,

1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:11.600
 but it's still the same universe. So there's not like universes existing in parallel?

1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:19.200
 No. Because, and the whole point is that if we were able to change our interpretation of

1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:25.120
 what's going on, we could perceive a different reference frame in this Rouliat.

1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:32.320
 Yeah, but that's not, that's just, yeah, that's the same Rouliat. That's the same universe.

1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:35.680
 You're just moving about. These are just coordinates in the universe.

1:48:35.680 --> 1:48:40.800
 So the way that's, the reason that's interesting is, imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence,

1:48:40.800 --> 1:48:47.200
 so the alien intelligence, we should say. The alien intelligence might live on Alpha Centauri,

1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:50.080
 but it might also live at a different place in rural space.

1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:54.000
 It can live right here on Earth. It just has a different reference frame that

1:48:54.000 --> 1:49:00.560
 includes a very different perception of the universe. And then because that rural space is

1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:06.480
 very large, I mean... Do we get to communicate with them? Right, that's...

1:49:06.480 --> 1:49:14.640
 Yeah, but it's also, well, one thing is how different the perception of the universe could be.

1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:20.800
 I think it could be bizarrely, unimaginably, completely different. And I mean, one thing to

1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:27.120
 realize is, even in kind of things I don't understand well, I know about the kind of

1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:32.400
 Western tradition of understanding science and all that kind of thing. And you talk to people

1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:39.600
 who say, well, I'm really into some Eastern tradition of this, that and the other. And

1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:46.560
 it's really obvious to me how things work. I don't understand it at all. But it is not obvious,

1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:51.040
 I think, with this kind of realization that there's these very different ways to interpret

1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:55.440
 what's going on in the universe. That kind of gives me at least... It doesn't help me to understand

1:49:55.440 --> 1:50:00.160
 that different interpretation, but it gives me at least more respect for the possibility that

1:50:00.160 --> 1:50:04.160
 there will be other interpretations. Yeah, it humbles you to the possibility that,

1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:10.000
 like, what is it? Reincarnation or all these, like, eternal recurrence with Nietzsche? Like,

1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:15.200
 just these ideas? Yeah. Well, you know, the thing that I realized about a bunch of those things is

1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:19.280
 that, you know, I've been sort of doing my little survey of the history of philosophy, just trying

1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:24.080
 to understand, you know, what can I actually say now about some of these things? And you realize

1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:29.600
 that some of these concepts, like the immortal soul concept, which, you know, I remember when I was a

1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:35.440
 kid and, you know, it was kind of a lots of religion bashing type stuff of people saying, you know,

1:50:35.440 --> 1:50:41.760
 well, we know about physics. Tell us how much does a soul weigh? And people are like, well,

1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:46.400
 how can it be a thing if it doesn't weigh anything? Well, now we understand, you know,

1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:50.800
 there is this notion of what's in brains that isn't the matter of brains, and it's something

1:50:50.800 --> 1:50:56.320
 computational. And there is a sense, and in fact, it is correct that it is in some sense immortal,

1:50:56.320 --> 1:51:01.440
 because this pattern of computation is something abstract that is not specific to the particular

1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:07.360
 material of a brain. Now, we don't know how to extract it, you know, in our traditional scientific

1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:12.960
 approach. But it's still something where it isn't a crazy thing to say there is something,

1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:18.240
 it doesn't weigh anything. That's a kind of a silly question. How much does it weigh? Well,

1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:22.480
 actually, maybe it isn't such a silly question in our model of physics, because the actual

1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:27.600
 computational activity has has a consequence for gravity and things. But that's a very subtle

1:51:27.600 --> 1:51:33.680
 you can talk about mass and energy and so on. There could be a what would you call a solitron.

1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:39.280
 Yes, yes. A particle that somehow contains soleness.

1:51:39.280 --> 1:51:44.160
 Yeah, right. Well, that's what, by the way, that's what Leibniz said. And, you know, one thing,

1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:48.720
 I've never understood this, you know, Leibniz had this idea of monads and monodology, and he had

1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:54.400
 this idea that what exists in the universe is this big collection of monads, and that the only

1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:59.040
 thing that one knows about the monads is sort of how they relate to each other. It sounds awfully

1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:04.960
 like hypergraphs, right? But Leibniz had really lost me at the following thing. He said, each of

1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:10.320
 these monads has a soul, and each of them has a consciousness. And it's like, okay, I'm out of

1:52:10.320 --> 1:52:14.480
 here. I don't understand this at all. I don't know what's going on. But I realized recently

1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:21.440
 that in his day, the concept that a thing could do something could spontaneously do something,

1:52:21.440 --> 1:52:26.160
 that was his only way of describing that. And so what I would now say as well is this

1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:32.000
 this abstract rule that runs to Leibniz, that would have been, you know, in 1690 or whatever,

1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:37.440
 that would have been kind of, well, it has a soul, it has a consciousness. And so, you know,

1:52:37.440 --> 1:52:42.000
 in a sense, it's like one of these, there's no new idea under the sun, so to speak. That's, you

1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:47.440
 know, that's a sort of a version of the same kinds of ideas, but couched in terms that are sort of

1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:49.840
 bizarrely different from the ones that we would use today.

1:52:49.840 --> 1:52:56.640
 Would you be able to maybe play devil's advocate on your conception of consciousness that like the

1:52:56.640 --> 1:53:02.320
 two characteristics of it that is constrained and there's a single thread of time? Is it possible

1:53:02.320 --> 1:53:10.320
 that Leibniz was onto something that the basic atom, the screwy atom of space has a consciousness?

1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:18.000
 Is that, so these are just words, right? But what is there, is there some sense where consciousness

1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:21.600
 is much more fundamental than you're making it seem?

1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:24.000
 I don't know. I mean, that, you know, I think...

1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.800
 Can you construct a world in which it is much more fundamental?

1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:32.800
 I think that, okay, so the question would be, is there a way to think about kind of,

1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:38.640
 if we sort of parse the universe down at the level of atoms of space or something,

1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:42.080
 could we say, well, so that's really a question of a different point of view,

1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:45.440
 a different place in real space. We're asking, you're asking the question,

1:53:45.440 --> 1:53:52.480
 could there be a civilization that exists? Could there be sort of conscious entities

1:53:52.480 --> 1:53:56.080
 that exist at the level of atoms of space? And what would that be like?

1:53:56.080 --> 1:53:59.520
 And I think that comes back to this question of, can we, you know, what's it like to be a cellular

1:53:59.520 --> 1:54:06.000
 automaton type thing? I mean, it's, you know, I'm not yet there. I don't know.

1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:12.800
 I mean, I think that this is a, and I don't even know yet quite how to think about this

1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:16.560
 in the sense that I was considering, you know, I'm, I never write fiction,

1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:20.640
 but I haven't written it since I was like 10 years old. And my fiction, I made one attempt,

1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:24.160
 which I sent to some science fiction writer friends of mine, and they told me it was terrible.

1:54:24.160 --> 1:54:26.720
 So the bedtime... This is a long time ago?

1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:29.680
 No, it was recently. Recently. They said it was terrible. That'd be

1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:34.640
 interesting to see you write a short story based on what sounds like it's already inspiring

1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:38.640
 short stories by, or stories by science fiction writers.

1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:43.440
 But, but I think the interesting thing for me is, you know, in the, what does it,

1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:47.440
 what is it like to be a whatever? How do you describe that? I mean, it's like,

1:54:47.440 --> 1:54:51.760
 that's not a thing that you describe in mathematics, that what is it like to be such and such?

1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:58.000
 Well, see, to me, when you say, what is it like to be something presumes that you're talking about

1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:10.000
 a singular entity? So, yeah, like there's some kind of feeling of the entity, the stuff that's

1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:15.840
 inside of it and the stuff that's outside of it. And then that's when consciousness starts making

1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:24.000
 sense. But, but then it seems like that could be generalizable. If you take some subset of

1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:28.640
 a cellular automata, you could start talking about what does that subset

1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:35.200
 may feel. But then you can, I think you could just take arbitrary numbers of subsets. Like,

1:55:35.840 --> 1:55:43.280
 to me, like you and I individually are consciousnesses, but you could also say

1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:48.320
 the two of us together is a singular consciousness. Maybe, maybe, I'm not so sure about that. I think

1:55:48.320 --> 1:55:53.280
 that the single thread of time thing may be pretty important. And that as soon as you start saying,

1:55:53.280 --> 1:55:58.160
 there are two different threads of time, there are two different experiences. And then we have to

1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:02.320
 say, how do they relate? How are they sort of entangled with each other? I mean, that may be a

1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:08.560
 different story of a thing that isn't much like, what are the ants? What's it like to be an ant,

1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:14.400
 where there's a sort of more collective view of the world, so to speak? I don't know. I think that,

1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:24.080
 I mean, this is, I don't really have a good, I mean, my best thought is, can we turn it

1:56:24.080 --> 1:56:29.280
 into a human story? It's like the question of, when we try and understand physics, can we turn

1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:33.120
 that into something which is sort of a human understandable narrative? And now what's it

1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:38.880
 like to be a such and such? Maybe the only medium in which we can describe that is something like

1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:47.280
 fiction, where it's kind of like you're telling the life story in that setting. But this is

1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:53.120
 beyond what I've yet understood how to do. Yeah, but it does seem so like with human consciousness,

1:56:53.120 --> 1:57:01.120
 we're made up of cells. And there's a bunch of systems that are networked that work together

1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:06.640
 that at this, at the human level, feel like a singular consciousness when you take,

1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:13.360
 yes. And so maybe like an ant colony is just too low level. Sorry, an ant is too low level.

1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:18.400
 Maybe you have to look at the ant colony. Yeah, I agree. There's some level at which

1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:23.840
 it's a conscious being. And then if you go to the planetary scale, then maybe that's going too far.

1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:30.320
 So there's a nice sweet spot for consciousness. No, I agree. I think the difficulty is that,

1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:36.960
 you know, okay, so in sort of people who talk about consciousness, one of the terrible things

1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:40.800
 I've realized, because I've now interacted with some of this community, so to speak,

1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:46.000
 some interesting people who do that kind of thinking. But one of the things I was saying

1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:53.840
 to one of the leading people in that area, I was saying that it must be kind of frustrating,

1:57:53.840 --> 1:57:57.200
 because it's kind of like a poetry story. That is, many people are writing poems,

1:57:57.200 --> 1:58:00.960
 but few people are reading them. So they're always these different, you know,

1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:08.080
 everybody has their own theory of consciousness, and they are very non inter sort of interdiscussable.

1:58:08.080 --> 1:58:13.600
 And by the way, I mean, you know, my own approach to sort of the question of consciousness,

1:58:13.600 --> 1:58:17.840
 as far as I'm concerned, I'm an applied consciousness operative, so to speak, because

1:58:17.840 --> 1:58:23.280
 I don't really, in a sense, the thing I'm trying to get out of it is how does it help me to understand

1:58:23.280 --> 1:58:29.520
 what's a possible theory of physics? And how does it help me to say, how do I go from this

1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:34.560
 incoherent collection of things happening in the universe to our definite perception and

1:58:34.560 --> 1:58:39.920
 definite laws and so on, and sort of an applied version of consciousness. And I think the reason

1:58:39.920 --> 1:58:44.400
 that sort of segues to a different kind of topic, but the reason that one of the things I'm

1:58:44.400 --> 1:58:49.040
 particularly interested in is kind of what's the analog of consciousness in systems very different

1:58:49.040 --> 1:58:55.360
 from brains. And so why does that matter? Well, you know, this whole description of this kind of

1:58:56.400 --> 1:58:59.920
 well, actually, you know what, we haven't talked about why the universe exists. So let's let's

1:58:59.920 --> 1:59:05.360
 get to why the universe exists. And then we then we can can talk about perhaps a little bit about

1:59:05.360 --> 1:59:11.280
 what these models of physics kind of show you about other kinds of things like molecular computing

1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:16.400
 and so on. Yes, that's good. Why does the universe exist? Okay, so we finally sort of more or less

1:59:16.400 --> 1:59:21.600
 set the stage, we've got this idea of this really add of this object that is made from following all

1:59:21.600 --> 1:59:26.960
 possible rules, the fact that it's sort of not just this incoherent mess, it's got all this

1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:35.200
 entangled structure in it, and so on. Okay, so what is this really add? Well, it is the working out

1:59:35.200 --> 1:59:41.200
 of all possible formal systems. So the sort of a question of why does the universe exist? It's

1:59:41.200 --> 1:59:47.200
 core question, you kind of started with is, you've got two plus two equals four, you've got some other

1:59:47.200 --> 1:59:53.200
 abstract results. But that's not actualized. It's just an abstract thing. And when we say we've

1:59:53.200 --> 1:59:57.520
 got a model for the universe, okay, it's this rule, you run it, and it'll make the universe. But it's

1:59:57.520 --> 2:00:03.440
 like, but, but, you know, where's it actually running? What, what, what is what is it actually

2:00:03.440 --> 2:00:09.760
 doing? Right? What is is it actual? Or is it merely a formal description of something? Okay.

2:00:09.760 --> 2:00:15.760
 So the thing to realize with this, with this, the thing about the rule yard is it's an inevitable,

2:00:15.760 --> 2:00:22.960
 it is the entangled running of all possible rules. So you don't get to say it's not like you're saying,

2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:29.120
 which rule yard are you picking? Because it's all possible formal rules. It's not like it's just,

2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:34.880
 you know, well, actually, it's only footnote, the only footnote, it's an important footnote,

2:00:34.880 --> 2:00:41.360
 is it's all possible computational rules, not hyper computational rules. That is,

2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:50.160
 it's running all the rules that would be accessible to a Turing machine, but is not running all the

2:00:50.160 --> 2:00:54.960
 rules that will be accessible to a thing that can solve problems in finite time that would take a

2:00:54.960 --> 2:01:00.080
 Turing machine infinite time to solve. So you can even Alan Turing knew this that you could make

2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:04.160
 oracles for Turing machines where you say, a Turing machine can't solve the whole thing problem

2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:09.040
 for Turing machines, it can't know what will happen in any Turing machine after an infinite time

2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:14.480
 in any finite time, but you could invent a box, just make a black box, you say, I'm going to sell

2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:19.040
 you an oracle that will just tell you, you know, press this button, it'll tell you what the Turing

2:01:19.040 --> 2:01:23.680
 machine will do after an infinite time, you can imagine such a box, you can't necessarily build

2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:28.720
 one in the physical universe, but you can imagine such a box. And so we could say, well, in addition

2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:35.520
 to, so in this Ruliad, we're imagining that there is a computational that at the end,

2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:39.360
 it's, it's running rules that are computational. It doesn't have a bunch of

2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:47.120
 oracle black boxes in it. You say, well, why not? Well, turns out if there are oracle black boxes,

2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:53.040
 the Ruliad that is, you can make a sort of super Ruliad that contains those oracle black boxes,

2:01:53.040 --> 2:01:57.360
 but it has a cosmological event horizon relative to the first one, they can't communicate.

2:01:57.360 --> 2:02:03.440
 In other words, you can, you can end up with what you end up happening, what ends up happening is

2:02:03.440 --> 2:02:08.320
 it's, it's, it's like in the physical universe, we, in this causal graph that represents the causal

2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:12.960
 relationships of different things, you can have an event horizon, where there's, where the causal

2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:18.800
 graph is disconnected, where the effect here, an event happening here does not affect an event

2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:22.960
 happening here, because there's a disconnection in the causal graph. And that's what happens in an

2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:30.240
 event horizon. And so what will happen between this kind of the ordinary Ruliad and the hyper Ruliad

2:02:30.240 --> 2:02:38.800
 is there is an event horizon, and you, you know, we in our Ruliad will just never know that there

2:02:38.800 --> 2:02:43.040
 is, that they're just separate things. They're not, they're not connected.

2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:46.000
 Maybe I'm not understanding, but just because we can't observe it,

2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:53.840
 why does that mean it doesn't exist? It might exist, but it does, it's not clear what it,

2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:58.480
 it's so what, so to speak, whether it exists. You know, what we're trying to understand is why

2:02:58.480 --> 2:03:04.240
 does our universe exist? We're not trying to ask the question what, you know, it's,

2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:10.640
 let me say another thing, let me make a meta comment, okay, which is that, that I have not

2:03:10.640 --> 2:03:19.040
 thought through this hyper Ruliad business properly. So I can't, the hyper Ruliad is referring to

2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:25.840
 a Ruliad in which hyper computation is possible. That's correct. Okay. So like what the, that foot

2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:34.160
 note, the footnote to the footnote is we're not sure why this is important. Yeah, that's right.

2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:41.120
 So let's, let's ignore that. Okay. It's already abstract enough. Okay. So, so, okay. So the one

2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:47.440
 question is, we have to say, if we're saying, why does the universe exist? One question is,

2:03:47.440 --> 2:03:52.800
 why is it this universe and not another universe? Yeah. Okay. So the important point about this

2:03:52.800 --> 2:04:00.160
 Ruliad idea is that it's in the Ruliad are all possible formal systems. So there's no choice

2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:05.120
 being made. There's no, there's no like, oh, we picked this particular universe and not that one.

2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:11.760
 That's the first thing. The second thing is the that we have to ask the question. So, so you say,

2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:18.400
 why does two plus two equals four exist? That's not really a that is a thing that necessarily

2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:23.760
 is that way, just on the basis of the meaning of the terms two and plus and equals and so on.

2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:31.280
 Right. So the thing is that this, this Ruliad object is in a sense a necessary object. It is

2:04:31.280 --> 2:04:37.120
 just the thing that is the consequence of working out the consequence of the formal definition of

2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:42.960
 things. You don't, it is not a thing where you're saying, and this is picked as the particular

2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:49.440
 thing. This is just something which necessarily is that thing because of the definition of what

2:04:49.440 --> 2:04:54.720
 it means to have computation. So it's a Ruliad. It's a formal system. Yes.

2:04:56.800 --> 2:05:05.520
 But does it exist? Ah, well, where are we in this whole thing? We are part of this Ruliad.

2:05:05.520 --> 2:05:14.400
 And so our, so there is no sense to say, does two plus two equals four exist? Well, that's,

2:05:14.400 --> 2:05:20.480
 that's in some sense, it necessarily exists. It's a necessary object. It's not a thing that

2:05:20.480 --> 2:05:25.600
 where you can ask, you know, it's, it's usually in philosophy, there's a sort of distinction

2:05:25.600 --> 2:05:31.040
 made between, you know, necessary truths, contingent truths, analytic propositions,

2:05:31.040 --> 2:05:34.960
 synthetic propositions, there are a variety of different versions of this. They're things which

2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:40.800
 are necessarily true, just based on the definition of terms. And there are things which happen to

2:05:40.800 --> 2:05:47.280
 be true in our universe. But we're weird, we don't exist in Rulial space. We, that's one of the

2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:54.960
 coordinates that define our existence, right? Well, okay, so, so yes, yes, but this Ruliad

2:05:54.960 --> 2:06:01.360
 is the set of all possible Rulial coordinates. So what we're saying is it contains that. So what

2:06:01.360 --> 2:06:07.760
 we're saying is we exist as, okay, so our perception of what's going on is we're at a particular

2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:12.240
 place in this Ruliad. And we are concluding certain things about how the universe works

2:06:12.240 --> 2:06:19.760
 based on that. But the question is, do we understand, you know, is there something where we say,

2:06:20.480 --> 2:06:27.360
 so, so why does it work that way? Well, the answer is, I think it has to work that way,

2:06:27.360 --> 2:06:34.160
 because this, there isn't, this Ruliad is a necessary object in the sense that it is a purely

2:06:34.160 --> 2:06:40.800
 formal object, just like two plus two equals four. It's not an object that was made of something. It's

2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:46.480
 an object that is just an expression of the necessary collection of formal relations that exist.

2:06:47.120 --> 2:06:54.640
 And so then the issue is, can we, in our experience of that, is it, you know, can we have tables and

2:06:54.640 --> 2:07:00.720
 chairs, so to speak, in that just by virtue of our experience of that necessary thing?

2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:06.240
 And, you know, what people have generally thought, and also that I don't know of a lot of

2:07:06.800 --> 2:07:11.680
 discussion of this, why does the universe exist question? It's been a very, you know,

2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:15.680
 I've been surprised actually at how little, I mean, I think it's one of these things that's

2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:23.120
 really kind of far out there. But the thing that that is, you know, the surprise here is that

2:07:23.680 --> 2:07:28.880
 all possible formal rules, when you run them together, and that's the critical thing,

2:07:28.880 --> 2:07:33.920
 when you run them together, they produce this kind of entangled structure that has a definite

2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:38.960
 structure. It's not just, you know, a random arbitrary thing, it's a thing with definite

2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:45.440
 structure. And that structure is the thing when we are embedded in that structure, when anything,

2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:50.640
 you know, the an entity embedded in that structure perceives something, which is,

2:07:51.360 --> 2:07:56.000
 then we can interpret as physics and things like this. So in other words, we don't have to ask the

2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:02.720
 question, the why does it exist? It necessarily exists. I'm missing this part. Why does it

2:08:02.720 --> 2:08:09.840
 necessarily exist? Okay, okay. So like you need to have it if you want to formalize the relation

2:08:10.400 --> 2:08:19.680
 between entities, but why do you need to have relations? Okay, okay. So let's say you say,

2:08:19.680 --> 2:08:28.640
 well, it's like, why does math have to exist? Okay, that's the question. Yeah, okay, fair question.

2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:36.160
 Let's see. I think the thing to think about is the existence of mathematics is something where,

2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:43.440
 given a definition of terms, what follows from that definition inevitably follows.

2:08:43.440 --> 2:08:54.080
 So now you can say, why define any terms? But in a sense, the, well, that's okay. So the definition

2:08:54.080 --> 2:09:01.600
 of terms, I mean, I think the way to think about this, let me see. So like, concrete terms?

2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:06.080
 Well, that's not very concrete. I mean, they're just things like, you know,

2:09:06.080 --> 2:09:13.920
 logical or right. But that's a thing. That's a powerful thing.

2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:18.960
 Well, it's a, yes, okay. But it's a, the point is that it is not a thing about,

2:09:19.680 --> 2:09:26.000
 people imagine there is, I don't know, the, an elephant or something or the,

2:09:26.880 --> 2:09:34.480
 elephants are presumably not necessary objects. They happen to exist as a result of kind of

2:09:34.480 --> 2:09:42.160
 biological evolution and whatever else. But the, the thing is that in some sense, that there is,

2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:48.880
 it is a different kind of thing to say, does plus exist? The, it is not, it's not, not like an

2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:55.840
 elephant. So a plus is, seems more fundamental, more basic than an elephant. Yes. But you can

2:09:55.840 --> 2:10:05.200
 imagine a world without plus or anything like it. Like why do formal things that are discreet, that

2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:12.000
 can be used to reason have to exist? Well, okay. So why, okay. So then the question is,

2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:18.640
 but the whole point is computation, we can certainly imagine computation. That is,

2:10:18.640 --> 2:10:24.720
 we can certainly say there is a formal system that we can construct abstractly in our minds

2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:32.240
 that is computation. And that, that's the, and you know, we can, we can imagine it, right? Now,

2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:40.480
 the question is, is it is that formal system, once we exist as observers embedded in that

2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:46.640
 formal system, that's enough to have something which is like our universe. And so then the,

2:10:46.640 --> 2:10:53.440
 then what you're kind of asking is, perhaps, is why, I mean, the point is we definitely

2:10:53.440 --> 2:11:00.080
 can imagine it. There's nothing that says that we're not saying that there's, it's sort of inevitable

2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:07.040
 that, that is a thing that we can imagine. We don't have to ask, does it exist? We're just,

2:11:07.040 --> 2:11:13.440
 it is definitely something we can imagine. Now that's, then we have this thing that is

2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:18.240
 a formally constructible thing that we can imagine. And now we have to ask the question,

2:11:18.240 --> 2:11:26.000
 what, you know, given that formally constructible thing, what is, what consequences does that,

2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:31.680
 if we were to perceive that formally, if we were embedded in that formally constructible thing,

2:11:31.680 --> 2:11:38.400
 what would be perceived about the world? And we would say, we perceive that the world exists,

2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:42.640
 because we are, we are seeing all of this mechanism of all these things happening. And,

2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:48.720
 but that's something that is just a feature of, it's, it's, it's something where we are, see,

2:11:48.720 --> 2:11:55.120
 another way of asking this that I'm trying to get at, I understand why it feels like this

2:11:56.240 --> 2:12:05.040
 rulliad is necessary. But maybe it's just me being human, but it feels like then

2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:12.160
 you should be able to, not us, but somehow step outside of the rulliad. Like what's

2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:18.480
 outside the rulliad? Well, the rulliad is all formal systems. So there's nothing, because

2:12:18.480 --> 2:12:22.560
 But that's what a human would say. I know that's what a human would say, because we're used to

2:12:22.560 --> 2:12:27.440
 the idea that there are, there's, but the whole point is that by the time it's all possible,

2:12:27.440 --> 2:12:36.000
 formal systems, it's, it's like, it is all things you can imagine. But no, all computations you can

2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:43.280
 imagine. But like, we don't, well, so that could be a code. Okay. So, so that's a, that's a fair

2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:51.760
 question. Is it possible to encode all, I mean, once we, is, is there something that isn't what

2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:57.040
 we can represent formally? Right. That is, that is, there's something that, and that's, I think,

2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:04.160
 related to the hyper rulliad footnote, so to speak, which I'm afraid that the, you know,

2:13:04.160 --> 2:13:08.800
 one of the things sort of interesting about this is, you know, there has been some discussion of

2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:14.400
 this in theology and things like that. But, which I don't necessarily understand all of.

2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:23.680
 But the, the key sort of new input is this idea that all possible formal systems, it's like,

2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:29.600
 you know, if you make a world, people say, well, you make a world with a particular, in a particular

2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:34.240
 way, with particular rules, but no, you don't do that. You can make a world that deals with all

2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:41.280
 possible rules, and then merely by virtue of living in a particular place in that world,

2:13:41.280 --> 2:13:46.400
 so to speak, we have the perception we have of, of what the world is like. Now, I have to say,

2:13:48.320 --> 2:13:53.200
 it's sort of interesting because I've, you know, I wrote this piece about this, and I, you know,

2:13:53.200 --> 2:13:59.600
 this philosophy stuff is not super easy. And I've, as I'm, as I'm talking to you about it,

2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:02.880
 and I actually haven't, you know, people have been interested in lots of different things we've

2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:07.600
 been doing, but this, why does the universe exist has been, I would say, one of the, one of the

2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:12.560
 ones that you would think people will be most interested in. But actually, I think they're

2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:19.360
 just like, oh, that's just something complicated. So, so I haven't, I haven't explained it as,

2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:22.400
 as much as I've explained a bunch of other things. And I have to say, I think I,

2:14:22.400 --> 2:14:28.880
 I think I may be missing a couple of pieces of that argument that would be so, so it's kind of a

2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:34.880
 like, well, you're, you're conscious being is computationally bounded. So you're missing,

2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:40.400
 having written quite a few articles yourself, you, you're now missing some of the pieces.

2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:44.800
 Yes, right. The limitation of being human. Right. One of the consequences of this,

2:14:44.800 --> 2:14:51.600
 why the, why the universe exists thing and this kind of concept of Rulee ads and, and, you know,

2:14:51.600 --> 2:14:56.080
 places in there representing our perception of the universe and so on, one of the weird

2:14:56.080 --> 2:15:03.440
 consequences is, if the universe exists, mathematics must also exist. And that's a weird

2:15:03.440 --> 2:15:08.880
 thing because mathematics, people have been very confused, including me, have been very confused

2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:15.440
 about the, the, the question of, of kind of what, what is the foundation of mathematics,

2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:20.800
 what is, what kind of a thing is mathematics is mathematics, something where we just write down

2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:25.440
 axioms like Euclid did for geometry and we just build the structure and we could have written

2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:29.760
 down different axioms and we'd have a different structure. Or is it something that has a more

2:15:29.760 --> 2:15:35.200
 fundamental sort of truth to it? And I have to say it's one of these cases where I've, I've long

2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:38.800
 believed that mathematics has a great deal of arbitraryness to it, that there are particular

2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:43.680
 axioms that kind of got written down by the Babylonians. And, you know, that's what we've

2:15:43.680 --> 2:15:48.160
 ended up with the mathematics that we have. And I have to say, actually, my, my wife has been telling

2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:52.640
 me for 25 years, she was a mathematician, she's been telling me, you're wrong about the foundations

2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:58.000
 of mathematics. And, and, you know, I'm like, no, no, no, I know what I'm talking about. And

2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:03.760
 finally, she's, she's much more right than, than I've been. So it's, it's one of the.

2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:10.560
 So I mean, her sense, in your sense, are we just, so this is to the question of metamath,

2:16:10.560 --> 2:16:14.000
 mathematics, are we just kind of on a trajectory through

2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:18.640
 through rural space, except in mathematics, through a trajectory of certain kind of

2:16:19.360 --> 2:16:24.320
 I think that's partly the idea. So I think that the notion is this. So 100 years ago,

2:16:24.320 --> 2:16:28.080
 a little bit more than 100 years ago, what people have been doing mathematics for ages,

2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:33.920
 but then in the, in the late 1800s, people decided to try and formalize mathematics and say, you

2:16:33.920 --> 2:16:38.080
 know, it is mathematics is, you know, we're going to break it down, we're going to make it like

2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:42.480
 logic, we're going to make it out of, out of sort of fundamental primitives. And that was people

2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:48.640
 like Frager and piano and Hilbert and so on. And they kind of got this idea of let's do kind of

2:16:48.640 --> 2:16:53.920
 Euclid, but even better, let's just make everything just in terms of this sort of symbolic axioms,

2:16:53.920 --> 2:16:59.280
 and then build up mathematics from that. And that, you know, they thought at the time,

2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:04.480
 as soon as they get these symbolic axioms that they made the same mistake, the kind of computational

2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:10.000
 irreducibility mistake, they thought as soon as we've written down the axioms, then it'll just

2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:15.840
 we'll just have a machine, kind of a supermathematica, so to speak, that can just grind out all true

2:17:15.840 --> 2:17:21.120
 theorems of mathematics. That got exploited by Goedl's theorem, which is basically the story

2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:25.760
 of computational irreducibility. It's that even though you know those underlying rules,

2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:31.600
 you can't deduce all the consequences in any finite way. And so, so that was, but now the question

2:17:31.600 --> 2:17:36.880
 is, okay, so they broke mathematics down into these axioms. And they say now you build up from

2:17:36.880 --> 2:17:44.080
 that. So what I'm increasingly coming to realize is, that's similar to saying, let's take a gas

2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:50.160
 and break it down into molecules. There's gas laws that are the large scale structure and so on,

2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:55.120
 that we humans are familiar with. And then there's the underlying molecular dynamics. And I think

2:17:55.120 --> 2:18:00.160
 that the axiomatic level of mathematics, which we can access with automated theorem proving and

2:18:00.160 --> 2:18:05.200
 proof assistance, and these kinds of things, that's the molecular dynamics of mathematics.

2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:10.560
 And occasionally we see through to that molecular dynamics. We see undecidability, we see other

2:18:10.560 --> 2:18:15.440
 things like this. One of the things I've always found very mysterious is that Goedl's theorem

2:18:15.440 --> 2:18:20.880
 shows that there are sort of things which cannot be finitely proved in mathematics. There are proofs

2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:25.920
 of arbitrary length, infinite length proofs that you might need. But in practical mathematics,

2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:31.280
 mathematicians don't typically run into this. They just happily go along doing their mathematics.

2:18:31.280 --> 2:18:36.480
 And I think what's actually happening is that what they're doing is they're looking at this,

2:18:36.480 --> 2:18:43.760
 they are essentially observers in metamathematical space. And they are picking a reference frame

2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:49.200
 in metamathematical space. And they are computationally bounded observers in metamathematical space,

2:18:49.200 --> 2:18:55.600
 which is causing them to deduce that the laws of metamathematics and the laws of mathematics,

2:18:55.600 --> 2:19:01.760
 like the laws of fluid mechanics, are much more understandable than this underlying molecular dynamics.

2:19:01.760 --> 2:19:08.560
 And so what gets really bizarre is thinking about kind of the analogy between metamathematics,

2:19:08.560 --> 2:19:16.960
 this idea of you exist in this kind of, in this sort of space of possible, in this kind of

2:19:16.960 --> 2:19:23.280
 mathematical space where the individual kind of points in the mathematical space are statements

2:19:23.280 --> 2:19:28.000
 in mathematics, and they're connected by proofs, where one statement, you know, you take a couple

2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:31.600
 of different statements, you can use those to prove some other statement, and you've got this

2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:36.720
 whole network of a proofs, that's the kind of causal network of mathematics of what can prove

2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:43.360
 what and so on. And you can say at any moment in the history of a mathematician, of a single

2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:50.800
 mathematical consciousness, you are in a single kind of slice of this kind of metamathematical

2:19:50.800 --> 2:19:55.760
 space, you know a certain set of mathematical statements, you can then deduce with proofs,

2:19:55.760 --> 2:20:01.040
 you can deduce other ones, and so on, you're kind of gradually moving through metamathematical space.

2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:07.120
 And so it's kind of the view is that the reason that mathematicians perceive mathematics to have

2:20:07.120 --> 2:20:12.080
 the sort of integrity and lack of kind of undecidability and so on that they do is because

2:20:12.080 --> 2:20:17.600
 they like we as observers of the physical universe, we have these limitations associated with

2:20:17.600 --> 2:20:22.160
 computational boundedness, single thread of time, consciousness limitations basically,

2:20:22.160 --> 2:20:26.320
 that the same thing is true of mathematicians perceiving sort of metamathematical space.

2:20:26.320 --> 2:20:30.560
 And so what's happening is that when you look at, if you look at one of these formalized

2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:35.920
 mathematics systems, something like, you know, Pythagoras's theorem, it'll be, it'll take,

2:20:35.920 --> 2:20:42.400
 oh, I don't know, what is it, maybe 10,000 individual little steps to prove Pythagoras's

2:20:42.400 --> 2:20:47.200
 theorem. And one of the bizarre things that's sort of an empirical fact that I'm trying to

2:20:47.200 --> 2:20:50.960
 understand a little bit better, if you look at different proof, if you look at different

2:20:50.960 --> 2:20:55.520
 formalized mathematics systems, they actually have different axioms underneath that they can all

2:20:55.520 --> 2:21:00.960
 prove Pythagoras's theorem. And so in other words, it's a little bit like what happens with gases,

2:21:00.960 --> 2:21:04.960
 we can have air molecules, we can have water molecules, but they still have fluid dynamics,

2:21:04.960 --> 2:21:09.280
 both of them have fluid dynamics. And so similarly, at the level that mathematics,

2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:14.560
 that mathematicians care about mathematics, it's way above the molecular dynamics, so to speak.

2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:18.320
 And they're all kinds of weird things, like for example, one thing I was realizing recently is

2:21:18.320 --> 2:21:24.160
 that the quantum theory of mathematics, that's a very bizarre idea. But basically, when you prove,

2:21:24.800 --> 2:21:29.680
 what is, you know, a proof is you've got one statement in mathematics, you go through other

2:21:29.680 --> 2:21:34.080
 statements, you eventually get to a statement you're trying to prove, for example, that's a path,

2:21:34.080 --> 2:21:39.120
 path in metamathematical space. And that's a single path, a single proof is a single path.

2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:44.960
 But you can imagine, there are other proofs of the same results. They're a bundle of proofs.

2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:47.200
 There's this whole set of possible proofs.

2:21:47.200 --> 2:21:50.880
 You could think of as branching, similar to the quantum mechanics model that you were talking

2:21:50.880 --> 2:21:55.360
 about. Exactly. And so then there's some invariance that you can formalize in the same way that you

2:21:55.360 --> 2:21:59.040
 can for the quantum mechanical. Right. So the question is in proof space,

2:21:59.040 --> 2:22:02.880
 you know, as you start thinking about multiple proofs, are there analogs of, for example,

2:22:02.880 --> 2:22:07.760
 destructive interference of multiple proofs? So here's a bizarre idea. It's just a couple of

2:22:07.760 --> 2:22:14.240
 days old, so not yet fully formed. But as you try and do that, when you have two different proofs,

2:22:14.240 --> 2:22:17.520
 it's like two photons going in different directions, you have two proofs which at an

2:22:17.520 --> 2:22:22.000
 intermediate stage are incompatible. And that's kind of like destructive interference.

2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:27.440
 Is it possible for this to instruct the engineering of automated proof systems?

2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:32.800
 Absolutely. I mean, it's a practical matter. I mean, this whole question, in fact, Jonathan

2:22:32.800 --> 2:22:37.760
 Gorat has a nice heuristic for automated theorem provers that's based on our physics project

2:22:37.760 --> 2:22:46.160
 that is looking for essentially using kind of using energy and in our models, energy is kind of

2:22:46.160 --> 2:22:51.920
 level of activity in this hypergraph. And so there's sort of a heuristic for automated theorem

2:22:51.920 --> 2:22:58.640
 proving about how do you pick which path to go down that is based on essentially physics.

2:22:58.640 --> 2:23:02.880
 And I mean, the thing that gets interesting about this is, is the way that one can sort of have

2:23:02.880 --> 2:23:07.040
 the interplay between like, for example, a black hole, what is a black hole in mathematics?

2:23:07.840 --> 2:23:12.240
 So the answer is, what is black hole in physics? A black hole in physics is where,

2:23:12.880 --> 2:23:18.560
 in the simplest form of black hole, time ends. That is all, you know, everything is crunched

2:23:18.560 --> 2:23:24.560
 down to the spacetime singularity, and everything just ends up at that singularity. So in our models,

2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:28.560
 and that's a little hard to understand in general relativity with continuous mathematics and what

2:23:28.560 --> 2:23:32.560
 does singularity look like? In our models, it's something very pragmatic. It's just,

2:23:32.560 --> 2:23:37.040
 you're applying these rules, time is moving forward. And then there comes a moment where the rules,

2:23:37.040 --> 2:23:42.480
 no rules apply. So time stops. It's kind of like the universe dies. The, you know, the,

2:23:42.480 --> 2:23:48.000
 the nothing happens in the universe anymore. Well, in mathematics, that's a decidable theory.

2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:52.640
 That's a theory. So theories which have undecidability, which are things like arithmetic,

2:23:52.640 --> 2:23:57.280
 set theory, all the serious models, theories in mathematics, they all have the feature that

2:23:57.280 --> 2:24:02.560
 there are proofs of arbitrary long length. And something like Boolean algebra, which is a decidable

2:24:02.560 --> 2:24:06.880
 theory, there are, you know, any question in Boolean algebra, you can just go crunch, crunch,

2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:12.320
 crunch, and in a known number of steps, you can answer it. You know, satisfiability, you know,

2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:17.120
 might be hard, but it's still a bounded number of steps to answer any satisfiability problem.

2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:23.520
 And so that's the notion of a black hole in physics where time stops. That's the,

2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:29.120
 that's analogous to in mathematics, where there aren't infinite length proofs, where when in

2:24:29.120 --> 2:24:33.920
 physics, you know, you can wander around the universe forever, if you don't run into a black

2:24:33.920 --> 2:24:38.480
 hole, if you run into a black hole and time stops, you're done. And it's the same thing in

2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:42.400
 mathematics between decidable, decidable theories and undecidable theories. That's a,

2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:47.440
 that's an example. And I think we're sort of the, the, the attempt to understand. So, so another

2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:53.840
 question is kind of what is the, what is the generativity of, of metamathematics? What is the

2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:58.800
 bulk theory of metamathematics? So in the literature of mathematics, there are about 3 million

2:24:58.800 --> 2:25:04.240
 theorems that people have, have published. And those represent, it's kind of on this, it's like,

2:25:04.240 --> 2:25:09.840
 like on the earth, we would be, you know, you know, we've put cities in particular places on the

2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:14.560
 earth. But yet there is ultimately, you know, we know the earth is roughly spherical, and there's

2:25:14.560 --> 2:25:20.160
 an underlying space. And we could just talk about, you know, the world of space in terms of where

2:25:20.160 --> 2:25:24.240
 our cities happen to be, but there's actually an underlying space. And so the question is, what's

2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:28.960
 that for metamathematics? And as we kind of explore what is, for example, for mathematics,

2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:33.920
 which is always likes taking sort of abstract limits. So an obvious abstract limit for

2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:39.360
 mathematics to take is the limit of the future of mathematics. That is, what is the limit of

2:25:39.360 --> 2:25:44.000
 what will be, you know, the ultimate structure of mathematics. And one of the things that's

2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:49.280
 an empirical observation about mathematics, that's quite interesting is that a lot of theories in

2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:54.240
 one area of mathematics algebraic geometry or something might have, they play into another

2:25:54.240 --> 2:26:00.160
 area of mathematics, that that same the same kind of a fundamental construct seem to occur

2:26:00.160 --> 2:26:04.560
 in very different areas of mathematics. And that structurally captured a bit with category theory

2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:09.120
 and things like that. But I think that there's probably an understanding of this metamathematical

2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:14.640
 space that will explain why different areas of mathematics ultimately sort of map into the same

2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:21.920
 thing. And I mean, you know, my little challenge to myself is what's time dilation in, in metamathematics?

2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:27.440
 In other words, as you, as you basically as you move around in this mathematical space of possible

2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:33.920
 statements, you know, what's how does that moving around? It's basically what's happening is that

2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:37.200
 as you move around in the space of mathematical statements, it's like you're changing from

2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:43.040
 algebra to geometry to whatever else. And you're trying to prove the same theorem. But as you try,

2:26:43.040 --> 2:26:47.440
 if you keep on moving to these different places, it's slower to prove that theorem because you

2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:51.120
 keep on having to translate what you're doing back to where you started from. And that's kind of the

2:26:51.120 --> 2:26:56.000
 beginnings of the analog of time dilation in mathematics. Plus there's probably fractional

2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:01.920
 dimensions in this space as well. Oh, this space is a very messy space. This space is much messier

2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:07.840
 than physical space. I mean, even in, even in the models of physics, physical space is very tame

2:27:07.840 --> 2:27:12.880
 compared to branchial space and rural space. I mean, the mathematical structure, you know,

2:27:12.880 --> 2:27:16.640
 branchial space is probably more like Hilbert space, but it's a rather complicated Hilbert space.

2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:24.400
 And rural space is more like this weird infinity groupoid story of growth and deacon. And, you

2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:29.040
 know, I can explain that a little bit because in, you know, in, in metamathematical space,

2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:36.320
 a, a path in metamathematical space is a, is a, a path between two statements is a way to get by

2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:42.160
 proofs is to way to find a proof that goes from one statement to another. And so one of the things

2:27:42.160 --> 2:27:46.640
 you can do, you can think about is you've got between statements, you've got proofs, and they

2:27:46.640 --> 2:27:51.840
 are paths between statements. Okay. So now you can go to the next level and you can ask, what about

2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:57.360
 a mapping from one proof to another? And so that's in, in category theory, that's kind of a higher

2:27:57.360 --> 2:28:02.560
 category that notion of higher categories where you're, where you're mapping not just between,

2:28:02.560 --> 2:28:07.360
 not just between objects, but you're mapping between the mappings between objects and so on.

2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:11.440
 And so you can keep doing that. You keep saying higher order proofs. I want

2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:16.160
 mappings between proofs, between proofs and so on. And that limiting structure. Oh, by the way,

2:28:16.160 --> 2:28:20.640
 one thing that's very interesting is imagine in proof space, you've got these two proofs.

2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:25.760
 And the question is, what is the topology of proof space? In other words, if you take these two

2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:30.880
 paths, can you continuously deform them into each other? Or is there some big hole in the middle

2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:34.800
 that prevents you from continuously deforming them one into the other? It's kind of like,

2:28:34.800 --> 2:28:38.480
 you know, when you, when you think about some, I don't know, some puzzle, for example, you're

2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:43.360
 moving pieces around on some puzzle, and you can think about the space of possible states of the

2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:47.680
 puzzle. And you can make this graph that shows from one state of the puzzle to another state of

2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:52.400
 the puzzle and so on. And sometimes you can easily get from one state to any other state,

2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:56.720
 but sometimes there'll be a hole in that space. And there'll be, you know, you always have to

2:28:56.720 --> 2:29:01.680
 go around the circuitous route to get from here to there. There won't be any direct way.

2:29:01.680 --> 2:29:06.640
 And that's kind of a question of, of whether there's sort of an obstruction in the space.

2:29:06.640 --> 2:29:12.720
 And so the question is in proof space, what is the, what are, you know, what does it mean if

2:29:12.720 --> 2:29:17.360
 there's an obstruction in proof space? Yeah, I don't even know what an obstruction means in

2:29:17.360 --> 2:29:22.640
 proof space, because for it to be an obstruction, it should be reachable some other way from some

2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:27.040
 other place, right? So this is like an unreachable part of the graph.

2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:31.920
 No, it's not just an unreachable part. It's a part where there are paths that go one way,

2:29:31.920 --> 2:29:35.760
 there are paths that go the other way. And this question of homotopy and mathematics is this

2:29:35.760 --> 2:29:40.880
 question, can you continuously deform, you know, from one path to another path? Or do you have to

2:29:40.880 --> 2:29:45.120
 go in a jump, so to speak? So it's like, if you're going around a sphere, for example, if you're

2:29:45.120 --> 2:29:50.400
 going around a, I don't know, a cylinder or something, you can wind around one way. And you

2:29:50.400 --> 2:29:55.360
 can, there's no, the paths where you can, where you can easily deform one path into another,

2:29:55.360 --> 2:29:58.960
 because it's just sort of sitting on the same side of the cylinder. But when you've got something

2:29:58.960 --> 2:30:03.280
 that winds all the way around a cylinder, you can't continuously deform that down to a point,

2:30:03.280 --> 2:30:07.360
 because it's stuck wrapped around. Well, my intuition about proof space is you should be

2:30:07.360 --> 2:30:10.880
 able to deform it. I mean that, because then otherwise it doesn't even make sense. Because

2:30:10.880 --> 2:30:16.560
 if the topology matters of the way you move about the space, then I don't even know what

2:30:16.560 --> 2:30:21.840
 that means. Well, what it would mean is that you would have one way of doing a proof of something

2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:26.560
 over here in algebra, and another way of doing a proof of something over here in geometry,

2:30:26.560 --> 2:30:30.800
 and there would not be an intermediate way to map between those proofs.

2:30:30.800 --> 2:30:34.400
 But how would that be possible if they started the same place and ended the same place?

2:30:35.120 --> 2:30:40.160
 Well, it's the same thing as, you know, we've got points on a, you know, if we've got paths on

2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:45.200
 a cylinder. I understand how it works in physical space, but it just doesn't, it feels like proof

2:30:45.200 --> 2:30:50.560
 space shouldn't have that. Okay, I mean. I'm not sure. I don't know. We'll know very soon,

2:30:50.560 --> 2:30:53.760
 because we get to do some experiments. This is the great thing about this stuff,

2:30:53.760 --> 2:30:58.800
 is that in fact, you know, in the next few days, I hope to do a bunch of experiments on this.

2:30:58.800 --> 2:31:05.200
 So you're playing like proofs in this kind of space? Yes. Yes. I mean, so, you know, this is toy,

2:31:05.200 --> 2:31:10.400
 you know, theories, and, you know, we've got good, so this kind of segues to perhaps another thing,

2:31:10.400 --> 2:31:18.320
 which is this whole idea of multi computation. So this, this is another kind of bigger idea that,

2:31:18.320 --> 2:31:25.120
 so, okay, this has to do with how do you make models of things? And it's going to, it's, so

2:31:25.760 --> 2:31:30.560
 I've sort of claimed that they've been sort of four epochs in the history of making models of

2:31:30.560 --> 2:31:36.320
 things. And, and this multi computation thing is, is the fourth is a new epoch.

2:31:36.320 --> 2:31:42.960
 What are the first three? The first one is, is back in antiquity, ancient Greek times, people were

2:31:42.960 --> 2:31:48.240
 like, what's the universe made of? Oh, it's made of, you know, everything is water, Thales, you know,

2:31:48.240 --> 2:31:54.080
 or everything is made of atoms. It's sort of what are things made of, or the, you know, there are

2:31:54.080 --> 2:31:59.200
 these crystal spheres that represent where the planets are and so on. It's like a structural

2:31:59.200 --> 2:32:04.320
 idea of how the universe is constructed. There's no real notion of dynamics. It's just what is the

2:32:04.320 --> 2:32:10.000
 universe? How is the universe made? Then we get to the 1600s, and we get to the sort of revolution

2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:16.880
 of mathematics being introduced into physics. And then we have this kind of idea of you write down

2:32:16.880 --> 2:32:23.680
 some equation, the what happens in the universe is the solving of that equation, time enters,

2:32:23.680 --> 2:32:28.480
 but it's usually just a parameter, we just can, you know, sort of slide it back and forth and say,

2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:35.280
 here's where it is. Okay, then we come to this kind of computational idea that I kind of started

2:32:35.280 --> 2:32:40.400
 really pushing in the early 1980s. As a result, you know, the things we were talking about before

2:32:40.400 --> 2:32:46.160
 about complexity, that was my motivation. But the biggest story was the story of kind of computational

2:32:46.160 --> 2:32:51.360
 models of things. And the big difference there from the mathematical models is in mathematical

2:32:51.360 --> 2:32:56.320
 models, there's an equation, you solve it, you got kind of slide time to the place where you want it.

2:32:56.320 --> 2:33:03.360
 In computational models, you give the rule, and then you just say, go run the rule. And time is not

2:33:03.360 --> 2:33:09.600
 something you get to slide. Time is something where it just you run the rule, time goes in steps.

2:33:09.600 --> 2:33:14.720
 And that's how you work out what how the system behaves, you don't time is not just a parameter.

2:33:14.720 --> 2:33:20.000
 Time is something that is about the running of these of these rules. And so there's this computational

2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:25.040
 irreducibility, you can't jump ahead in time. But there's still important thing is there's still

2:33:25.040 --> 2:33:30.160
 one thread of time. It's still the case, you know, the cellular automaton state, then it has the next

2:33:30.160 --> 2:33:35.280
 state and the next state and so on. The thing that is kind of we've sort of tipped off by quantum

2:33:35.280 --> 2:33:40.240
 mechanics, in a sense, although it actually feeds back even into durability and things like that,

2:33:40.800 --> 2:33:46.240
 that there are these multiple threads of time. And so in this multi computation paradigm, the

2:33:46.240 --> 2:33:50.800
 kind of idea is, instead of there being the single thread of time, there are these kind of

2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:55.920
 distributed asynchronous threads of time that are happening. And the thing that's sort of different

2:33:55.920 --> 2:34:01.520
 there is, if you want to know what happened, if you say what happened in the system, in the case

2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:08.320
 of the computational paradigm, you just say, well, after 1000 steps, we got this result. Right.

2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:13.120
 But in the multi computational paradigm, after 1000 steps, not even clear what 1000 steps means,

2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:17.520
 because you've got all these different threads of time. But there is no state. There's all these

2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:22.000
 different possible, you know, there's all these different parts. And so the only way you can

2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:26.880
 know what happened is to have some kind of observer who is saying here's how to parse the

2:34:26.880 --> 2:34:31.120
 results of what was going on. Right. But that observer is embedded and they don't have a complete

2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:36.560
 picture. So in the case of physics, that's right. Yes. And then in the, but that's, but so the idea

2:34:36.560 --> 2:34:42.240
 is that in this multi computation setup, that it's this idea of these multiple threads of time,

2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:48.560
 and models that are based on that. And this is similar to what people think about in non deterministic

2:34:48.560 --> 2:34:53.200
 computation. So you have a Turing machine, usually it has a definite state, it follows another state,

2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:56.960
 follows another state. But typically what people have done when they've thought about these kinds

2:34:56.960 --> 2:35:00.880
 of things is they've said, well, there are all these possible paths and non deterministic Turing

2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:05.200
 machine can follow all these possible paths. But we just want one of them, we just want the one

2:35:05.200 --> 2:35:10.160
 that's the winner that factors the number or whatever else. And similarly, it's the same story

2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:15.200
 in logic programming and so on. But we say we've got this goal, find us a path to that goal,

2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:20.080
 I just want one path, then I'm happy. Or theorem proving same story, I just want one proof and

2:35:20.080 --> 2:35:25.600
 then I'm happy. What's happening in multi computation in physics is we actually care about

2:35:25.600 --> 2:35:30.880
 many paths. And well, there is a case for example, probabilistic programming is a version of

2:35:30.880 --> 2:35:35.120
 multi computation in which you're looking at all the paths, you're just asking for probabilities of

2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:40.880
 things. But in a sense in physics, we're taking different kinds of samplings. For example, in

2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:45.040
 quantum mechanics, we're taking a different kind of sampling of all these multiple paths.

2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:51.760
 But the thing that is notable is that when you are when you're an observer embedded in this thing,

2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:59.040
 etc, etc, etc, with various other sort of footnotes and so on, it is inevitable that the thing that

2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:04.960
 you parse out of this system looks like general activity and quantum mechanics. In other words,

2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:10.640
 that just by the very structure of this multi computational setup, it inevitably is the case

2:36:11.200 --> 2:36:19.040
 that you have certain emergent laws. Now, why is this perhaps not surprising? In thermodynamics

2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:24.720
 and statistical mechanics, there are sort of inevitable emergent laws of sort of gas dynamics

2:36:24.720 --> 2:36:29.920
 that are independent of the of the details of molecular dynamics, sort of the same kind of thing.

2:36:29.920 --> 2:36:34.640
 But I think what happens is what's a sort of a funny thing that I just been understanding very

2:36:34.640 --> 2:36:41.440
 recently is when when I kind of introduced this whole sort of computational paradigm complexity

2:36:41.440 --> 2:36:46.000
 ish thing back in the 80s, it was kind of like a big downer, because it's like there's a lot of

2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:51.040
 stuff you can't say about what systems will do. And then what I realized is and then you might say,

2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:55.360
 now we've got multi computation, it's even worse, you know, it's isn't just one thread of time that

2:36:55.360 --> 2:37:00.080
 we can't explain, it's all these threads of time, we can't explain anything. But the following thing

2:37:00.080 --> 2:37:06.640
 happens, because there is all this irreducibility and any detailed thing you might want to answer,

2:37:06.640 --> 2:37:12.640
 very hard to answer. But when you have an observer who has certain characteristics like computational

2:37:12.640 --> 2:37:19.440
 boundedness, sequentiality of time and so on, that observer only samples certain aspects of this

2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:25.040
 incredible complexity going on in this multi computational system. And that observer is sensitive

2:37:25.040 --> 2:37:30.720
 only to some underlying core structure of this multi computational system. There is all this

2:37:30.720 --> 2:37:35.920
 irreducible computation going on all these details. But to that kind of observer, what's

2:37:35.920 --> 2:37:42.560
 important is only the core structure of multi computation, which means that observer observes

2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:48.320
 comparatively simple laws. And I think it is inevitable that that observer observes laws which

2:37:48.320 --> 2:37:52.960
 are mathematically structured like general relativity and quantum mechanics, which by the

2:37:52.960 --> 2:37:57.840
 way, are the same law in our in our model of physics. So that's an explanation why there's

2:37:57.840 --> 2:38:03.840
 simple laws that explain a lot for this observer. Potentially, yes. But what the place where this

2:38:03.840 --> 2:38:10.160
 gets really interesting is there are all these fields of science where people have kind of gotten

2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:14.960
 stuck where they say we'd really love to have a physics like theory of economics, we'd really

2:38:14.960 --> 2:38:20.480
 love to have a physics like law and linguistics. You got to talk about molecular biology here.

2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:25.280
 Okay. So where where where does multi computation come in for biology, economics is super

2:38:25.280 --> 2:38:28.880
 interesting too, but biology. Okay, let's talk about that. So let's talk about chemistry for a

2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:34.160
 second. Okay. So I mean, I have to say, you know, this is such a weird business for me because,

2:38:34.160 --> 2:38:38.880
 you know, there are these kind of paradigmatic ideas and then the actual applications. And

2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:42.560
 it's like I've always said, I know nothing about chemistry, I learned all the chemistry I know,

2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:46.320
 you know, the night before some exam when I was 14 years old. But yeah, but I've actually learned

2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:50.560
 a bunch more chemistry. And in more from language these days, we have really pretty nice symbolic

2:38:50.560 --> 2:38:55.200
 representation of chemistry. And in understanding the design of that, I've actually I think learned

2:38:55.200 --> 2:38:59.360
 a certain amount of chemistry. If you quizzed me on sort of basic high school chemistry,

2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:05.760
 I would probably totally fail. But but but okay, so what is chemistry? I mean, chemistry is sort of

2:39:05.760 --> 2:39:10.960
 a story of, you know, chemical reactions are like you've got this particular chemical that's

2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:15.600
 represented as some graph of, you know, these are, these are this configuration of molecules

2:39:15.600 --> 2:39:20.480
 with these bonds and so on. And a chemical reaction happens, you've got these sort of two

2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:24.800
 graphs, they interact in some way, you've got another graph or multiple other graphs out. So

2:39:24.800 --> 2:39:30.960
 that's kind of the, the sort of the, the abstract view of what's happening in chemistry. And so

2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:36.240
 when you do a chemical synthesis, for example, you are given certain sort of these are possible

2:39:36.240 --> 2:39:41.920
 reactions that can happen. And you're asked, can you piece together this a sequence of such reactions,

2:39:41.920 --> 2:39:46.400
 a sequence of such sort of axiomatic reactions, usually called name reactions in chemistry,

2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:51.440
 can you piece together a sequence of these reactions, so that you get out at the end,

2:39:51.440 --> 2:39:55.440
 this great molecule you were trying to synthesize. And so that's a story very much like theorem

2:39:55.440 --> 2:40:01.120
 proving. And people have done, actually, they started in the 1960s, looking at, at kind of the

2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:06.080
 theorem proving approach to that, although it didn't really, it didn't, it didn't sort of done too early,

2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:10.880
 I think. But anyway, so that's kind of the view is that that chemistry chemical reactions are

2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:16.560
 this story of, of all these different sort of paths of possible things that go on. Okay, let's,

2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:23.360
 let's go to an even lower level. Let's say, instead of asking about which species of molecules

2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:27.440
 we're talking about, let's look at individual molecules. And let's say we're looking at individual

2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:32.240
 molecules, and they are having chemical reactions. And we're building up this big graph of all these

2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:37.200
 reactions that are happening. Okay, so, so then we've got this big graph. And by the way, that

2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:44.240
 big graph is incredibly similar to these hypergraph rewriting things. In fact, in the underlying

2:40:44.240 --> 2:40:49.280
 theory of multi computation, there, these things we call token event graphs, which are basically,

2:40:49.280 --> 2:40:53.840
 you've broken your state into tokens, like in the case of a hypergraph, you've broken it into

2:40:53.840 --> 2:40:59.440
 hyper edges. And each event is just consuming some number of tokens, and producing some number of

2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:03.280
 tokens. But then you have to, there's a lot of work to be done on update rules.

2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:09.680
 In terms of what they actually offer chemistry. Yeah, what they offer our observed chemistry.

2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:13.760
 Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. And we've been working on that actually, because we have this beautiful

2:41:13.760 --> 2:41:18.160
 system in, in Wolfram language for representing chemistry symbolically. So we actually have,

2:41:18.160 --> 2:41:21.600
 you know, this is a, this is an ongoing thing to actually figure out what they are for some

2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:27.520
 practical cases. Does that require human injection or can it be automatically discovered, these

2:41:27.520 --> 2:41:30.960
 update rules? Well, if we can do quantum chemistry better, we could probably discover them

2:41:30.960 --> 2:41:35.600
 automatically. But I think in, in reality, right now, it's like, there are these particular

2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:39.840
 reactions. And really, to understand what's going on, we're probably going to pick a particular

2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:45.440
 subtype of chemistry. And just because, because let me explain where this is going, the place

2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:50.080
 that here's, here's where this is going. So we've got this whole network of all these

2:41:50.080 --> 2:41:55.680
 molecules, having all these reactions and so on. And this is some whole multi computational story,

2:41:55.680 --> 2:42:02.560
 because each, each sort of chemical reaction event is its own separate event, we're saying

2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:06.720
 they all happen asynchronously, we're not describing in what order they happen, you know,

2:42:06.720 --> 2:42:10.560
 maybe that order is governed by some quantum mechanics thing, doesn't really matter,

2:42:10.560 --> 2:42:16.000
 we're just saying they happen in some order. And then we ask, what is the, what's the, you know,

2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:20.960
 how do we think about the system? Well, this thing is some kind of big multi computational

2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:26.240
 system. The question is, what is the chemical observer? And one possible chemical observer is,

2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:30.160
 all you care about is, did you make that particular drug molecule? You're just asking,

2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:34.240
 you know, the, for the one path, another thing you might care about is, I want to know the

2:42:34.240 --> 2:42:39.840
 concentration of each species, right? I want to know, you know, at every stage, I'm going to solve

2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:43.280
 the differential equations that represent the concentrations. And I want to know what those

2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:49.200
 all are. But there's more, because when, and it's kind of like, you're going below in statistical

2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:55.280
 mechanics, there's kind of all these molecules bouncing around. And you might say, we're just

2:42:55.280 --> 2:43:00.000
 going to ignore, we're just going to look at the aggregate densities of certain kinds of molecules,

2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:04.800
 but you can look at a lower level, you can look at this whole graph of possible interactions.

2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:10.000
 And so the kind of the idea would be, what, you know, is the only chemical observer,

2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:15.680
 one who just cares about overall concentrations, or can there be a chemical observer who cares

2:43:15.680 --> 2:43:22.080
 about this network of what happened? And so that the question then is, so let me give an analogy.

2:43:22.080 --> 2:43:26.160
 So this is where I think this is potentially very relevant to molecular, molecular biology and

2:43:26.160 --> 2:43:31.920
 molecular computing. When we think about a computation, usually we say, it's input, it's

2:43:31.920 --> 2:43:36.560
 output, we, you know, or chemistry, we say, there's this input, we're going to make this molecule

2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:42.880
 as the output. But what if what we actually encode, what if our computation, what if the

2:43:42.880 --> 2:43:48.000
 thing we care about is some part of this dynamic network? What if it isn't just the input and

2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:51.760
 the output that we care about? What if there's some dynamics of the network that we care about?

2:43:51.760 --> 2:43:57.760
 Now, imagine you're a chemical observer, what is a chemical observer? Well, in molecular biology,

2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:03.200
 there are all kinds of weird sorts of observers, there are membranes that exist that have, you

2:44:03.200 --> 2:44:08.640
 know, different kinds of molecules that combine to them, things like this. It's not obvious that the,

2:44:08.640 --> 2:44:13.760
 from a human scale, we just measure the concentration of something is the relevant story.

2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:18.480
 We can imagine that, for example, when we look at this whole network of possible reactions,

2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:22.560
 we can imagine, you know, at a physical level, we can imagine, well, what was the actual momentum

2:44:22.560 --> 2:44:26.880
 direction of that, of that molecule? What was it, which we don't pay any attention to when we're

2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:31.040
 just talking about chemical concentrations? What was the orientation of that molecule,

2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:36.640
 these kinds of things? And so here's the place where I'm, I have a little suspicion, okay?

2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:41.200
 So one of the questions in biology is what matters in biology? And that is, you know,

2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:46.400
 we have all these chemical reactions, we have all these, all these molecular processes going on in,

2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:52.400
 you know, in biological systems, what matters? And, you know, one of the things is to be able

2:44:52.400 --> 2:44:57.040
 to tell what matters, well, so a big story of the what matters question was what happened in

2:44:57.040 --> 2:45:02.800
 genetics in 1953 when DNA, when it was figured out how DNA worked. Because before that time,

2:45:02.800 --> 2:45:06.720
 you know, genetics have been all these different effects and complicated things. And then it was

2:45:06.720 --> 2:45:12.240
 realized, ah, there's something new, a molecule can store information, which wasn't obvious before

2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:17.040
 that time, a single molecule can store information. So there's a place where there can be something

2:45:17.040 --> 2:45:21.760
 important that's happening in molecular biology. And it's just in the sequence that's storing

2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:28.720
 information in a molecule. So the possibility now is imagine this dynamic network, this, you know,

2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:33.520
 causal graphs and multiway causal graphs and so on, that represent all of these different

2:45:33.520 --> 2:45:38.800
 reactions between molecules. What if there is some aspect of that that is storing information

2:45:38.800 --> 2:45:43.840
 that's relevant for molecular biology? In the dynamic aspect of that. Yes, that's right. So

2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:49.680
 that it's similar to how the structure of a DNA molecule stores information, it could be the

2:45:49.680 --> 2:45:55.520
 dynamics of the system, some stores information. And this kind of process might allow you to give

2:45:56.240 --> 2:46:01.280
 predictions of what that would be. Well, yes, but also imagine that you're trying to do,

2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:07.520
 for example, imagine you're trying to do molecular computation. Okay, you might think the way we're

2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:10.960
 going to do molecular computation is, we're just going to run the thing, we're going to see what

2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:15.280
 came out, we're going to see what molecule came out. This is saying that's not the only thing you

2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:20.000
 can do. There is a different kind of chemical observer that you can imagine constructing,

2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:25.120
 which is somehow sensitive to this dynamic network. Exactly how that works, how we make that

2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:31.520
 measurement, I don't know, but a few ideas, but that that's what's important, so to speak. And

2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:35.760
 that that means, and by the way, you can do the same thing, even for Turing machines, you can say

2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:40.800
 if you have a multiway Turing machine, you can say, how do you compute with a multiway Turing

2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:45.600
 machine? You can't say, well, we've got this input and this output, because the thing has all these

2:46:45.600 --> 2:46:50.240
 threads of time, it's got lots of outputs. And so then you say, well, what does it even mean to be

2:46:50.240 --> 2:46:54.640
 a universal multiway Turing machine? I don't fully know the answer to that. But it has an

2:46:54.640 --> 2:47:01.280
 interesting idea, freak Turing out for sure. Because then the dynamics of the trajectory of

2:47:01.280 --> 2:47:07.920
 the computation matters. Yes, yes. I mean, but the thing is that that so this is again a story of

2:47:07.920 --> 2:47:12.080
 what's the observer, so to speak. And chemistry, what's what's the observer there? Now, to give

2:47:12.080 --> 2:47:18.400
 an example of where that might matter, a very sort of present day example is in immunology,

2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:26.160
 where, we have whatever it is, 10 billion different kinds of antibodies that are all

2:47:26.160 --> 2:47:30.960
 these different shapes and so on, we have a trillion different kinds of T cell receptors

2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:36.800
 that we can that we produce. And the traditional theory of immunology is this

2:47:36.800 --> 2:47:41.440
 clonal selection theory, where we're constantly producing, randomly producing all these different

2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:46.160
 antibodies. And as soon as one of those binds to an antigen, then that one gets amplified,

2:47:46.160 --> 2:47:53.120
 and we produce more of that antibody and so on. Back in the 1960s, immunologist called Nils

2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:58.240
 Yerner, who was the guy who invented molecular antibodies, various other things, kind of had

2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:02.320
 this network theory of the immune system, where it would be like, well, we produce antibodies,

2:48:02.320 --> 2:48:07.760
 but then we produce antibodies to the antibodies, anti antibodies, and we produce anti anti antibodies,

2:48:07.760 --> 2:48:12.000
 and we get this whole dynamic network of interactions between different immune system

2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:18.880
 cells. And that was that, that was kind of a qualitative theory at that time. And it's,

2:48:18.880 --> 2:48:23.040
 I've been a little disappointed because I've been studying immunology a bit recently. And I knew

2:48:23.040 --> 2:48:26.640
 something about this, like 35 years ago or something. And I knew, you know, I'd read a

2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:31.360
 bunch of the books, and I talked to a bunch of the people and so on. And it was like an emerging

2:48:31.360 --> 2:48:36.720
 theoretical immunology world. And then I look at the books now, and they're very thick, because

2:48:36.720 --> 2:48:40.960
 they've got, you know, there's just a ton known about immunology, and, you know, all these different

2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:45.840
 pathways, all these different details and so on. But the theoretical sections seem to have shrunk.

2:48:47.280 --> 2:48:53.600
 And so it's, so the question is, what, you know, for example, immune memory, where is the,

2:48:53.600 --> 2:48:57.680
 where does the immune memory reside? Is it actually some cell sitting in our bone marrow

2:48:57.680 --> 2:49:01.760
 that is, you know, living for the whole of our lives that's going to spring into action as soon

2:49:01.760 --> 2:49:05.920
 as we're showing the same antigen? Or is it something different from that? Is it something

2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:10.320
 more dynamic? Is it something more like some network of interactions between these different

2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:14.880
 kinds of immune system cells and so on? And it's known that there are plenty of interactions

2:49:14.880 --> 2:49:19.840
 between T cells and, you know, there's plenty of dynamics. But what the consequence of that

2:49:19.840 --> 2:49:26.320
 dynamics is is not clear. And to have a qualitative theory for that doesn't, doesn't seem to exist.

2:49:26.320 --> 2:49:30.320
 In fact, I was just, just been trying to study this. So I'm quite incomplete in my study of

2:49:30.320 --> 2:49:34.320
 these things. But I was a little bit taken aback because I've, I've been looking at these things.

2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:37.680
 And it's like, and then they get to the end where they have the most advanced theory that they've

2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:43.920
 got. And it turns out it's a cellular automaton theory. It's like, okay, well, at least I understand

2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:52.160
 that theory. But, but, you know, I think that the possibility is that in, this is a place where,

2:49:52.160 --> 2:49:56.720
 if you want to know, you know, explain roughly how the immune system works, it ends up being

2:49:56.720 --> 2:50:02.240
 this dynamic network. And then the, the, you know, the immune consciousness, so to speak,

2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:07.280
 the observer ends up being something that, you know, in the end, it's kind of like, does the human

2:50:07.280 --> 2:50:12.960
 get sick or whatever. But it's a, it's something which is a complicated story that relates to this

2:50:12.960 --> 2:50:17.120
 whole sort of dynamic network and so on. And I think that's another place where this kind of

2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:22.640
 notion of, where, where I think multi computation has the possibility, see one of the things,

2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:26.560
 okay, you can end up with something where, yes, there is a general relativity in there.

2:50:26.560 --> 2:50:31.760
 There, but it turns out, but it may turn out that the observer who sees general relativity

2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:35.760
 in the immune system is an observer that's irrelevant to what we care about, about the

2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:40.240
 immune system. I mean, it could be, yes, there is some effect where, you know, there's some,

2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:45.360
 you know, time dilation of T cells interacting with whatever, but it's like, that's an effect

2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:49.200
 that's just irrelevant. And the thing we actually care about is things about, you know,

2:50:49.760 --> 2:50:54.320
 what happens when you have a vaccine that goes into someplace in shapespace and, you know,

2:50:54.320 --> 2:50:58.640
 how does that affect other places in shapespace and how does that spread? You know, what's the,

2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:03.120
 what's the analog of the speed of light in shapespace, for example, that's an important issue.

2:51:03.120 --> 2:51:07.520
 If you have one of these dynamic theories, it's like, you know, you're, you're poking to shapespace

2:51:07.520 --> 2:51:11.920
 by having, you know, let's say, a vaccine or something that has a particular configuration

2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:18.240
 in shapespace, how, how quickly as this dynamic network spreads out, how quickly do you get

2:51:18.240 --> 2:51:22.160
 sort of other antibodies in different places in shapespace, things like that.

2:51:22.160 --> 2:51:24.400
 When you say shapespace, you mean the shape of the molecules?

2:51:24.400 --> 2:51:25.040
 Yes.

2:51:25.040 --> 2:51:30.080
 And then, so this is like, it could be deeply connected to the protein and multi protein

2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:34.640
 folding, all of that kind of stuff. So to be able to say something interesting about the

2:51:34.640 --> 2:51:42.800
 dance of proteins, that then actually has an impact on helping develop drugs, for example,

2:51:42.800 --> 2:51:46.880
 or has an impact on virology, immunology, helping.

2:51:46.880 --> 2:51:51.680
 Well, I think that the big thing is, you know, when we think about molecular biology,

2:51:52.320 --> 2:51:57.760
 the, you know, what, what is the qualitative way to think about it? You know, in other words,

2:51:57.760 --> 2:52:04.800
 is it chemical reaction networks? Is it, you know, genetics, you know, DNA, big, you know,

2:52:04.800 --> 2:52:08.240
 big news, it's kind of, there's a digital aspect to the whole thing.

2:52:08.240 --> 2:52:12.240
 You know, what is the qualitative way to think about how things work in biology?

2:52:12.880 --> 2:52:16.240
 You know, when we think about, I don't know, some phenomenon like aging or something,

2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:20.240
 which is a big complicated phenomenon, which just seems to have all these different tentacles,

2:52:20.240 --> 2:52:25.120
 is it really the case that, that can be thought about in some, you know, without DNA,

2:52:25.120 --> 2:52:29.520
 when people were describing, you know, genetic phenomena that were, you know, dominant,

2:52:29.520 --> 2:52:33.680
 recessive, this, that, and the other, it got very, very complicated. And then people realized,

2:52:33.680 --> 2:52:37.680
 oh, it's just, you know, and what is a gene and so on and so on and so on.

2:52:37.680 --> 2:52:41.680
 Then people realized it's just base pairs. And there's this digital representation. And so the

2:52:41.680 --> 2:52:46.400
 question is, what is the overarching representation that we can now start to think about using a

2:52:46.400 --> 2:52:50.560
 molecular biology? I don't know how this will work out. And this is again, one of these things

2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:56.480
 where, and the place where that gets important is, you know, maybe molecular biology is doing

2:52:56.480 --> 2:53:03.200
 molecular computing by using some dynamic process that is something where it is very happily saying,

2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:06.960
 oh, I just got a result. It's in the dynamic structure of this network. Now I'm going to go

2:53:06.960 --> 2:53:11.680
 and do some other thing based on that result, for example. But we're like, oh, I don't know what's

2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:16.240
 going on. You know, it's just, we just measured them levels of these chemicals and we couldn't

2:53:16.240 --> 2:53:22.880
 conclude anything. But it just we're looking at the wrong thing. And so that's kind of the potential

2:53:22.880 --> 2:53:30.080
 there. And it's, I mean, these things are, I don't know, it's for me, it's like, I've not really,

2:53:30.080 --> 2:53:34.400
 that was not a view. I mean, I've thought about molecular computing for ages and ages and ages.

2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:40.400
 And I've always imagined that the big story is kind of the original promise of nanotechnology

2:53:40.400 --> 2:53:45.920
 of like, can we make a molecular scale constructor that will just build the molecule in any shape?

2:53:45.920 --> 2:53:51.200
 I don't think I'm now increasingly concluding, that's not the big point. The big point is something

2:53:51.200 --> 2:53:56.000
 more dynamic. That will be an interesting endpoint for any of these things. But that's

2:53:56.000 --> 2:54:00.160
 perhaps not the thing, you know, because the one example we have in molecular computing

2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:05.840
 that's really working is us biological organisms. And, you know, maybe the thing that's important

2:54:05.840 --> 2:54:11.360
 there is not this, you know, what chemicals do you make, so to speak, but more this kind of dynamic

2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:15.520
 process dynamic process. And then you can have a good model like the hypo grafted to then

2:54:15.520 --> 2:54:21.040
 explore what like simulated again, make predictions and if they

2:54:21.040 --> 2:54:26.560
 I think just have a way to reason about biology. I mean, it's hard, you know, but first of all,

2:54:26.560 --> 2:54:31.680
 biology doesn't have theories like physics, you know, physics is a much more successful sort of

2:54:31.680 --> 2:54:37.200
 global theory kind of kind of area, you know, biology, what are the global theories of biology,

2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:42.080
 pretty much Darwinian evolution, that's the only global theory of biology, you know, any other

2:54:42.080 --> 2:54:46.800
 theory is just a, well, the kidneys work this way, this thing works this way and so on. There

2:54:46.800 --> 2:54:52.080
 isn't, I suppose, another global theory is digital information in DNA. That's another sort of global

2:54:52.080 --> 2:54:59.600
 fact about biology. But the difficult thing to do is to match something you have a model of in

2:54:59.600 --> 2:55:04.560
 the hypo graft to the actual, like, how do you discover the theory? How do you discover the

2:55:04.560 --> 2:55:08.960
 theory? Okay, you have something that looks nice and makes sense, but like, you have to match it

2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:13.920
 to validation and experiment. Oh, sure, right. And that's tricky because you're walking around in

2:55:13.920 --> 2:55:19.920
 the dark. Not entirely. I mean, so, you know, for example, and what we've been trying to think about

2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:26.960
 is take actual chemical reactions. Okay. So, you know, one of my goals is, can I compute the primes

2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:32.880
 with molecules? Okay, that's if I can do that, then I kind of maybe I can compute things. And,

2:55:32.880 --> 2:55:37.360
 you know, there's this nice automated lab, these guys, these emerald cloud lab people have built

2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:41.920
 with Wolfen language and so on. That's an actual physical lab. And you send it a piece of Wolfen

2:55:41.920 --> 2:55:47.280
 language code and it goes and, you know, actually does physical experiments. And so one of my

2:55:47.280 --> 2:55:52.640
 goals, because I'm not a test tube kind of guy, I'm more of a software kind of person, is can I

2:55:52.640 --> 2:55:57.520
 make something where, you know, in this automated lab, we can actually get it so that there's some

2:55:57.520 --> 2:56:02.720
 gel that we made. And, you know, the positions of the stripes are the primes. I love it. Yeah.

2:56:02.720 --> 2:56:07.440
 I mean, that would be that will be an example of where and that will be with a particular,

2:56:08.320 --> 2:56:12.880
 you know, framework for actually doing the molecular computing, you know, with particular

2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:18.480
 kinds of molecules. And there's a lot of kind of ambient technological mess, so to speak, associated

2:56:18.480 --> 2:56:22.800
 with Oh, is it carbon? Is it this? Is it that, you know, is it important that there's a bromine

2:56:22.800 --> 2:56:28.320
 atom here, etc. etc. etc. This is all chemistry that I don't know much about. And, you know,

2:56:28.320 --> 2:56:33.200
 that's that's a sort of, you know, unfortunately, that's down at the level, you know, I would like

2:56:33.200 --> 2:56:38.320
 to be at the software level, not at the level of the transistors, so to speak. But in chemistry,

2:56:38.320 --> 2:56:42.240
 you know, there's a certain amount we have to do, I think at the level of transistors before we get

2:56:42.240 --> 2:56:47.360
 up to being able to do it, although, you know, automated labs certainly help in in setting that

2:56:47.360 --> 2:56:55.040
 up. I talked to a guy named Charles Hoskinson. He mentioned that he's collaborating with you.

2:56:55.040 --> 2:57:00.560
 He's an interesting guy. He sends me papers on speaking of automated theorem proving a lot.

2:57:00.560 --> 2:57:05.520
 He's exceptionally well read on that area as well. So what's the nature of your collaboration

2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:11.360
 with him? He's the creator of Cardano. What's the nature of the collaboration between Cardano

2:57:11.360 --> 2:57:15.760
 and the whole space of blockchain and Wolfram, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Blockchain, all that kind

2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:23.680
 of stuff. Well, okay, we're segueing to a slightly different world. But but so, although not completely

2:57:23.680 --> 2:57:28.400
 I'm not completely unconnected. Right. The whole thing is somehow connected. I know. I mean,

2:57:29.360 --> 2:57:33.440
 you know, the strange thing in my life is I've sort of alternated between doing basic science

2:57:33.440 --> 2:57:39.040
 and doing technology about five times in my life so far. And the thing that's just crazy about it

2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:43.680
 is, you know, every time I do one of these alternations, I think there's not going to be a

2:57:43.680 --> 2:57:47.920
 way back to the other thing. And like I thought for this physics project, I thought, you know,

2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:52.160
 we're doing fundamental theory of physics, maybe it'll have an application in 200 years.

2:57:52.160 --> 2:57:58.800
 But now I've realized, actually, this multi computation idea is applicable here and now.

2:57:58.800 --> 2:58:03.840
 And in fact, it's also giving us this way. I'll just mention one other thing. And then

2:58:03.840 --> 2:58:11.120
 we're going to talk about blockchain. The question of actually that relates to several

2:58:11.120 --> 2:58:19.360
 different things. But one of the things about, okay, so our Wolfram language, which is our attempt

2:58:19.360 --> 2:58:23.440
 to kind of represent everything in the world computationally. And it's the thing I kind of

2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:29.760
 started building 40 years ago, in the form of actual Wolfram language, 35 years ago. It's kind

2:58:29.760 --> 2:58:37.280
 of this idea of can we can we express things about the world in computational terms. And,

2:58:37.280 --> 2:58:41.600
 you know, we've come a long way in being able to do that. Wolfram Alpha is kind of the consumer

2:58:41.600 --> 2:58:46.320
 version of that where you're just using natural languages as input. And it turns it into our

2:58:46.320 --> 2:58:50.800
 symbolic language. And that's, you know, the symbolic language, Wolfram language is what

2:58:50.800 --> 2:58:55.840
 people use and have been using for the last 33 years. Actually, Mathematica, which is its

2:58:55.840 --> 2:59:05.360
 first instantiation, will be one third of a century old in October. And that it's kind of

2:59:05.360 --> 2:59:09.200
 interesting. What do you mean one third of a century? Does it mean 33 or 30? What do we

2:59:09.200 --> 2:59:16.960
 mean? 33 and a third. 33 and a third. So I've never heard of anyone celebrating that anniversary,

2:59:16.960 --> 2:59:21.120
 but I like it. I know. A third of a century, though, it's like, you know, get many, many

2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:25.600
 slices of a century that are interesting. But, you know, I think that the thing that's really

2:59:25.600 --> 2:59:29.840
 striking about that is that means, you know, including the whole sort of technology stack

2:59:29.840 --> 2:59:34.160
 I built around that's about 40 years old. And that means it's a significant fraction of the total

2:59:34.160 --> 2:59:39.360
 age of the computer industry. And it's, I mean, I think it's cool that we can still run, you know,

2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:44.960
 Mathematica version one programs today and so on. And we've sort of maintained compatibility.

2:59:44.960 --> 2:59:49.760
 And we've been just building this big tower all those years of just more and more and more

2:59:49.760 --> 2:59:53.120
 computational capabilities. It's sort of interesting, we just made this this picture

2:59:54.160 --> 2:59:59.920
 of kind of the different kind of threads of computational content of, you know, mathematical

2:59:59.920 --> 3:00:05.840
 content and, and, you know, all sorts of things with, you know, data and graphs and whatever

3:00:05.840 --> 3:00:10.560
 else. And what you see in this picture is about the first 10 years, it's kind of like it's just

3:00:10.560 --> 3:00:16.640
 a few threads. And then then about maybe 15, 20 years ago, it kind of explodes in this whole

3:00:16.640 --> 3:00:20.720
 collection of different threads of all these different capabilities that are now part of

3:00:20.720 --> 3:00:25.200
 orphan language and representing different things in the world. But the thing that was

3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:30.880
 super lucky in some sense is it's all based on one idea. It's all based on the idea of symbolic

3:00:30.880 --> 3:00:36.240
 expressions and transformation rules for symbolic expressions, which was kind of what I originally

3:00:36.240 --> 3:00:42.880
 put into this SMP system back in 1979, that was a predecessor of the whole orphan language stack.

3:00:42.880 --> 3:00:48.720
 So that idea was an idea that I got from sort of trying to understand mathematical logic and so

3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:55.040
 on. It was my attempt to kind of make a general human comprehensible model of computation of

3:00:55.040 --> 3:00:59.360
 the just everything is a symbolic expression. And all you do is transform symbolic expressions.

3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:06.320
 And, you know, in, in retrospect, I was very lucky that I understood as little as I understood

3:01:06.320 --> 3:01:11.200
 then, because had I understood more, I would have been completely freaked out about all the

3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:17.680
 different ways that that kind of model can fail. Because what do you do when you have a symbolic

3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:22.320
 expression, you make transformations for symbolic expressions? Well, for example, one question is

3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:26.880
 there may be many transformations that could be made in a very multi computational kind of way.

3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:32.240
 But what we're doing is picking, we're using the first transformation that applies. And we keep

3:01:32.240 --> 3:01:36.800
 doing that until we reach a fixed point. And that's the result. And that's kind of a very,

3:01:37.360 --> 3:01:42.880
 it's kind of a way of sort of sliding around the edge of multi computation. And back when I was

3:01:42.880 --> 3:01:48.240
 working on SMP and things, I actually thought about these questions about about how, you know,

3:01:48.240 --> 3:01:53.280
 how, what determines the this kind of evaluation path. So for example, you know, you work out

3:01:53.280 --> 3:01:58.960
 Fibonacci, you know, Fibonacci is recursive thing, f of n is f of n minus one plus f of n minus two,

3:01:58.960 --> 3:02:03.440
 and you get this whole tree of recursion, right. And there's the question of how do you evaluate

3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:07.920
 that tree of recursion? Do you do it sort of depth first, where you go all the way down one side,

3:02:07.920 --> 3:02:12.560
 you do it breadth first, where you're kind of collecting the terms together, where you know

3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:16.720
 that you know, f of eight plus f of seven, f of seven plus f of six, you can collect the f of

3:02:16.720 --> 3:02:21.280
 sevens and so on. These are, you know, I didn't realize that at the time, it's kind of funny,

3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:27.040
 I was working on on gauge field theories back in 1979. And I was also working on the evaluation

3:02:27.040 --> 3:02:33.360
 model in SMP, and they're the same problem. But it took me 40 more years to realize that.

3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:38.320
 And this question about how you do this sort of evaluation front, that's a question of reference

3:02:38.320 --> 3:02:44.800
 frames. It's a question of kind of the the story of, I mean, that that's, that is basically this

3:02:44.800 --> 3:02:50.480
 question of, in what order is the universe evaluated? And that and so what you realize is

3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:54.800
 there's this whole sort of world of different kinds of computation that you can do sort of

3:02:54.800 --> 3:02:59.040
 multi computationally. And that's a, that's an interesting thing. It has a lot of implications

3:02:59.040 --> 3:03:03.440
 for distributed computing and so on. It also has a potential implication for blockchain,

3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:08.080
 which we haven't fully worked out, which is, and this is not what we're doing with Cardano, but

3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:16.560
 this is a different thing. The, this is something where one of the questions is, when you have,

3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:22.640
 in a sense, blockchain is a deeply sequentialized story of time, because in blockchain, there's

3:03:22.640 --> 3:03:28.720
 just one copy of the ledger, and you're saying, this is what happened, you know, time has progressed

3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:32.800
 in this way. And there are little things around the edges, as you try and reach consensus and so

3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:38.400
 on. And, and, you know, actually, we just recently, we've had this little conference, we organized

3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:42.800
 about the theory of distributed consensus, because I realized that a bunch of interesting things

3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:46.960
 that some of our science can tell one about that. But that's a different, let's, let's not go down

3:03:46.960 --> 3:03:50.880
 that, that part. Yeah, yeah. But distributed consensus that still has a sequential, there's

3:03:50.880 --> 3:03:56.160
 like one. There's still sequentiality. So don't tell me you're thinking through like how to apply

3:03:56.160 --> 3:04:03.680
 multi computation to blockchain. Yes. And so, so that becomes a story of, you know, instead of

3:04:03.680 --> 3:04:09.440
 transactions all having to settle in one ledger, it's like a story of all these different ledgers,

3:04:09.440 --> 3:04:14.320
 and they all have to have some ultimate consistency, which is what causal invariance would give one,

3:04:14.320 --> 3:04:19.040
 but it can take a while. And the, it can take a while is kind of like quantum mechanics.

3:04:19.040 --> 3:04:24.080
 So it's kind of what's happening is that these different paths of history that correspond to,

3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:28.000
 you know, in one path of history, you got paid this amount in another path of history,

3:04:28.000 --> 3:04:32.880
 you got paid this amount. In the end, the universe will always become consistent. Now,

3:04:32.880 --> 3:04:38.160
 now the way it will, it works is, okay, it's a little bit more complicated than that. What happens

3:04:38.160 --> 3:04:42.880
 is the way space is knitted together in our theory of physics is through all these events.

3:04:43.600 --> 3:04:49.600
 And the, the, the idea is that the way that economic space is knitted together is,

3:04:49.600 --> 3:04:55.280
 is there these autonomous events that essentially knit together economic space? So there are all

3:04:55.280 --> 3:04:59.440
 these threads of transactions that are happening. And the question is, can they be made consistent?

3:04:59.440 --> 3:05:05.440
 Are there, is there something forcing them to be sort of a consistent fabric of economic reality?

3:05:05.440 --> 3:05:10.800
 And sort of what this has led me to is trying to realize how does economics fundamentally work?

3:05:11.360 --> 3:05:16.800
 And, you know, what is economics? And, you know, what, what are the atoms of economics,

3:05:16.800 --> 3:05:22.960
 so to speak? And so what I've kind of realized is that, that sort of the, perhaps I don't even

3:05:22.960 --> 3:05:28.400
 know if this is right yet. There's sort of events in economics of transactions. There are states of

3:05:28.400 --> 3:05:34.080
 agents that are kind of the atoms of economics. And then transactions are kind of agents,

3:05:34.720 --> 3:05:39.840
 transact and some, transact in some way, and that's an event. And then the question is,

3:05:39.840 --> 3:05:45.200
 how do you knit together sort of economic space from that? What is there an economic space? Well,

3:05:45.200 --> 3:05:49.120
 all these transactions, there's a whole complicated collection of possible transactions. But one

3:05:49.120 --> 3:05:54.080
 thing that's true about economics is we tend to have the notion of a definite value for things.

3:05:54.640 --> 3:06:04.640
 We could imagine that, you know, you buy a cookie from somebody and they want to get a movie ticket.

3:06:05.280 --> 3:06:12.240
 And there is some way that AI bots could make some path from the cookie to the movie ticket

3:06:12.240 --> 3:06:17.920
 by all these different trans intermediate transactions. But in fact, we have an approximation

3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:24.080
 to that, which is we say they each have a dollar value. And we have this kind of numeraire concept

3:06:24.080 --> 3:06:29.840
 of there's just a way of kind of, of taking this whole complicated space of transactions

3:06:29.840 --> 3:06:35.920
 and parsing it in something which is a kind of a simplified thing that is kind of like a parsing

3:06:35.920 --> 3:06:42.880
 of physical space. And so my guess is that the yet again, I mean, it's crazy that all these things

3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:48.800
 are so connected. This is another multi computation story, another story of where what's happening

3:06:48.800 --> 3:06:54.800
 is that the economic consciousness, the economic observer is not going to deal with all of those

3:06:54.800 --> 3:06:58.880
 are different microscopic transactions. They're just going to parse the whole thing by saying,

3:06:58.880 --> 3:07:03.760
 there's this value, it's a number. And that's that's their understanding of their summary

3:07:03.760 --> 3:07:07.680
 of this economic network. And there will be all kinds of things like they're all kinds of

3:07:07.680 --> 3:07:12.320
 arbitrage opportunities, which are kind of like the quantum effects in this whole thing. And

3:07:12.880 --> 3:07:17.440
 that's, you know, and places where there's where there's sort of different paths that can be followed

3:07:17.440 --> 3:07:24.720
 and and so on. And there's so the question is, can one make a sort of global theory of economics?

3:07:24.720 --> 3:07:30.880
 And then my test case is again, what is time dilation in economics? And and I know for,

3:07:30.880 --> 3:07:35.120
 you know, if you imagine a very agricultural economics where people are growing lettuces and

3:07:35.120 --> 3:07:39.040
 fields and things like this, and you ask questions about, well, if you're transporting

3:07:39.040 --> 3:07:43.760
 lettuces to different places, you know, what is the value of the lettuces after you have to

3:07:43.760 --> 3:07:48.000
 transport them versus if you're just sitting in one place and selling them, and you can kind of

3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:51.600
 get a little bit of an analogy there. But I think there's a there's a better and more complete

3:07:51.600 --> 3:07:56.480
 analogy. And that that's the question of is there a theory like general relativity, that is a global

3:07:56.480 --> 3:08:01.120
 theory of economics? And is it about something we care about? It could be that there is a global

3:08:01.120 --> 3:08:06.240
 theory, but it's about a feature of economic reality that isn't important to us. Now another

3:08:06.240 --> 3:08:12.080
 part of the story is, can one use those ideas to make essentially a distributed blockchain,

3:08:12.080 --> 3:08:16.960
 a distributed generalization of blockchain, kind of the quantum analog of money, so to speak,

3:08:16.960 --> 3:08:22.080
 where where you have, for example, you can have uncertainty relations where you're saying, you

3:08:22.080 --> 3:08:27.600
 know, well, if I if I insist on knowing my bank account right now, there'll be some uncertainty.

3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:32.960
 If I'm prepared to wait a while, then it'll be much more certain. And so there's, you know,

3:08:32.960 --> 3:08:39.040
 is there a way of using and so we've made a bunch of prototypes of this, which I'm not yet happy

3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:43.280
 with, but I realized is to really understand these prototypes, I actually have to have a

3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:48.080
 foundational theory of economics. And so that's kind of a, you know, it may be that we could

3:08:48.080 --> 3:08:52.240
 deploy one of these prototypes as a practical system, but I think it's really going to be much

3:08:52.240 --> 3:08:56.240
 better if we actually have an understanding of how this plugs into kind of economics.

3:08:56.240 --> 3:09:02.400
 That means like a fundamental theory of transactions between entities. Well, that's what

3:09:02.400 --> 3:09:07.680
 you mean by economics. Yes, I think so. But I mean, you know, how how there emerge sort of

3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:11.360
 laws of economics, I don't even know. And I've been asking friends of mine who are who are

3:09:11.360 --> 3:09:17.120
 economists and things, what is economics? You know, is it an axiomatic theory? Is it a theory

3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:22.560
 that is a kind of a qualitative description theory? Is it, you know, what kind of a theory is it? Is

3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:27.520
 it a theory? You know, what kind of thinking it's like, like in biology, in evolutionary biology,

3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:31.280
 for example, there's a certain, there's a certain pattern of thinking that goes on in evolutionary

3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:36.480
 biology, where if you're a, you know, a good evolutionary biologist, somebody says, that creature

3:09:36.480 --> 3:09:41.120
 has a weird horn. And they'll say, well, that's because this and this and this and the selection

3:09:41.120 --> 3:09:46.800
 of this kind and that kind. And that's the story. And it's not a mathematical story. It's a story

3:09:46.800 --> 3:09:51.760
 of a different type of thinking about these things. By the way, evolutionary biology is yet

3:09:51.760 --> 3:09:56.880
 another place where it looks like this multi computational idea can be applied. And that's

3:09:56.880 --> 3:10:02.240
 where, where maybe speciation is related to things like event horizons. And there's a whole,

3:10:02.240 --> 3:10:07.360
 whole other kind of world of that. But it seems like this kind of model can be applicable to so

3:10:07.360 --> 3:10:15.360
 many aspects, like the different levels of understanding of our reality. So it can be the

3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:21.440
 biology, the chemistry, at the physics level, the economics, and you could potentially say, the

3:10:21.440 --> 3:10:27.440
 thing is, it's like, okay, sure, at all these levels in my rhyme, it might make sense as a

3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:31.440
 model. The question is, can you make useful predictions at one of these levels?

3:10:31.440 --> 3:10:36.000
 And that's, that's right. And that's, that's really a question of, you know, it's a weird

3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:41.600
 situation because it's a situation where the model probably has definite consequences.

3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:46.640
 The question is, are they consequences we care about? Yeah. And that's some, you know, and so,

3:10:47.280 --> 3:10:56.640
 so in the case of, in the economic case, the, where, so, you know, the one, one thing is this,

3:10:56.640 --> 3:11:02.720
 this idea of using kind of physics like notions to construct a kind of distributed analog block

3:11:02.720 --> 3:11:08.080
 chain. Okay, the much more pragmatic thing is a different direction. And it has to do with

3:11:08.080 --> 3:11:12.800
 this computational language that we built to describe the world that knows about, you know,

3:11:12.800 --> 3:11:17.360
 different kinds of cookies and knows about different cities and knows about how to compute

3:11:17.360 --> 3:11:22.480
 all these kinds of things. One of the things that is of interest is if you want to run the world,

3:11:23.120 --> 3:11:28.160
 you need, you know, with, with, with contracts and laws and rules and so on. There are rules

3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:34.000
 at a human level. And there are kind of things like, and so this, this gets one into the idea of

3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:39.600
 computational contracts. You know, right now, when we write a contract, it's a piece of legalese,

3:11:39.600 --> 3:11:43.760
 it's, you know, it's just written in English. And it's not something that's automatically

3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:50.080
 analyzable, executable, whatever else, it's just English, you know, back in Gottfried Leibniz,

3:11:50.080 --> 3:11:56.560
 back in, you know, 1680 or whatever, was like, I'm going to, you know, figure out how to use

3:11:56.560 --> 3:12:02.320
 logic to decide legal cases and so on. And he had kind of this idea of, let's make a computational

3:12:02.320 --> 3:12:08.880
 language for the human, for human law. Forget about modeling nature, forgot about natural laws.

3:12:08.880 --> 3:12:13.040
 What about human law? Can we make kind of a computational representation of that?

3:12:13.040 --> 3:12:17.680
 Well, I think finally we're close to being able to do that. And one of the projects that I hope

3:12:17.680 --> 3:12:23.120
 to get to, as soon as the, there's a little bit of slowing down of some of this Cambrian explosion

3:12:23.120 --> 3:12:27.280
 that's happening as a project I've been meaning to really do for a long time, which is what I'm

3:12:27.280 --> 3:12:32.480
 calling a symbolic discourse language. It's just finishing the job of being able to represent

3:12:32.480 --> 3:12:38.320
 everything like the conversation we're having in computational terms. And one of the use cases

3:12:38.320 --> 3:12:43.600
 for that is computational contracts. Another use case is something like the Constitution that says

3:12:43.600 --> 3:12:47.600
 what the AIs, what we want the AIs to do. But this is useful. So you're saying,

3:12:48.240 --> 3:12:53.120
 so these are like, you're saying computational contracts, but the smart contracts, this is what's

3:12:53.120 --> 3:12:57.920
 in the domain of cryptocurrencies known as smart contracts. And so the language you've developed,

3:12:57.920 --> 3:13:04.320
 this symbolic or seek to further develop symbolic discourse language, enables you to

3:13:05.520 --> 3:13:09.680
 write a contract. Write a contract that richly represents

3:13:10.640 --> 3:13:15.440
 some aspect of the world. But so, I mean, smart contracts tend to be right now,

3:13:15.440 --> 3:13:20.000
 mostly about things happening on the blockchain. And sometimes they have oracles. And in fact,

3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:25.280
 our WolfMalpha API is the main thing people use to get information about the real world,

3:13:25.280 --> 3:13:30.880
 so to speak, within smart contracts. So WolfMalpha, as it stands, is a really good oracle

3:13:30.880 --> 3:13:34.640
 for whoever wants to use it. That's perhaps where the relationship with Cardano is.

3:13:34.640 --> 3:13:38.080
 Yeah. Well, that's how we started getting involved with blockchains, as we realized people were

3:13:38.080 --> 3:13:43.600
 using, you know, WolfMalpha as the oracle for smart contracts, so to speak. And so that got us

3:13:43.600 --> 3:13:49.360
 interested in blockchains in general. And what was ended up happening is, WolfMalpha language is

3:13:49.360 --> 3:13:52.720
 with its symbolic representation of things is really very good at representing

3:13:53.360 --> 3:13:58.240
 things like blockchains. And so I think we now have, I mean, don't really know all the comparisons,

3:13:58.240 --> 3:14:03.040
 but we now have a really nice environment within WolfMalpha language for dealing with the sort of,

3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:07.280
 you know, for representing what happens in blockchains, for analyzing what happens in

3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:14.240
 blockchains. We have a whole effort in blockchain analytics. And, you know, we've sort of published

3:14:14.240 --> 3:14:19.440
 some samples of how that works. But it's, you know, because our technology stack, WolfMalpha language

3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:25.040
 and Mathematica are very widely used in the quant finance world, there's a sort of immediate

3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:32.720
 sort of co evolution there of sort of the quant finance kind of thing, and blockchain analytics.

3:14:32.720 --> 3:14:37.520
 And that's some, so it's kind of the representation of blockchain in computational language.

3:14:37.520 --> 3:14:43.280
 Then ultimately, it's kind of like, how do you run the world with code? That is, how do you write

3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:47.680
 sort of all these things which are right now regulations and laws and contracts and things

3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:53.440
 in computational language. And kind of the ultimate vision is that sort of something happens in the

3:14:53.440 --> 3:14:57.920
 world. And then there's this giant domino effect of all these computational contracts that trigger

3:14:57.920 --> 3:15:03.200
 based on the thing that happened. And there's a whole story to that. And of course, you know,

3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:08.320
 I like to always pay attention to the latest things that are going on. And I really, I kind of like

3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:13.600
 blockchain because it's a, it's a, it's another rethinking of kind of computation. It's kind of

3:15:13.600 --> 3:15:18.240
 like, you know, cloud computing was a little bit of that of sort of persistent kind of

3:15:18.960 --> 3:15:24.400
 computational resources and so on. And, you know, this multi computation is a big rethinking of

3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:29.040
 kind of what it means to compute. Blockchain is another bit of rethinking of what it means to

3:15:29.040 --> 3:15:33.920
 compute the idea that you lodge kind of these autonomous lumps of computation out there in

3:15:33.920 --> 3:15:40.320
 the blockchain world. And one of the things that just sort of for fun, so to speak, as we've been

3:15:40.320 --> 3:15:45.600
 doing a bit of stuff with NFTs, and we just did some NFTs on Cardano, and we'll be doing some more.

3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:52.400
 And, you know, we did some cellular automaton NFTs on Cardano, like quite a bit. And, you know,

3:15:52.400 --> 3:15:58.000
 one of the things I've realized about NFTs is that there's kind of this notion, and we're

3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:03.280
 really working on this, you know, I like recording stuff, you know, one of the things that's come

3:16:03.280 --> 3:16:09.520
 out of kind of my science, I suppose, is this history matters type story of, you know, it's

3:16:09.520 --> 3:16:14.000
 not just the current stage, it's the history that matters. And I've kind of, I don't think this is,

3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:18.720
 I should be realizing, maybe it's not coincidental that I'm sort of the human who's recorded more

3:16:18.720 --> 3:16:23.280
 about themselves than anybody else. And then I end up with these science results that say history

3:16:23.280 --> 3:16:28.400
 matters, which was not those things, I didn't think those were connected. But there are at least

3:16:28.400 --> 3:16:34.000
 correlated, yes. Yeah, right. So, you know, this question about sort of recording what has happened

3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:38.320
 and having sort of a permanent record of things, one of the things that's kind of interesting

3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:42.160
 there is, you know, you put up a website and it's got a bunch of stuff on it. But, you know,

3:16:42.160 --> 3:16:46.480
 you have to keep paying the hosting fees or the thing's going to go away. But one of the things

3:16:46.480 --> 3:16:51.040
 about blockchain is quite interesting is if you put something on a blockchain and you pay,

3:16:51.040 --> 3:16:56.800
 you know, your commission to get that thing, you know, put on, you know, mind put on the blockchain,

3:16:56.800 --> 3:17:02.720
 then in a sense, everybody who comes after you is, you know, they are motivated to keep your

3:17:02.720 --> 3:17:06.960
 thing alive, because that's what keeps the consistency of the blockchain. So in a sense,

3:17:06.960 --> 3:17:11.760
 with sort of the NFT world, it's kind of like, if you want to have something permanent, well,

3:17:11.760 --> 3:17:16.400
 at least for the life of the blockchain, but even if the blockchain goes out of circulation,

3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:20.640
 so to speak, there's going to be enough value in that whole collection of transactions

3:17:20.640 --> 3:17:24.240
 that people are going to archive the thing. But that means that, you know, pay once,

3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:29.520
 and you're kind of, you're lodged in the blockchain forever. And so we've been kind of playing around

3:17:29.520 --> 3:17:36.160
 with the sort of a hobby thing of mine of thinking about sort of the NFTs and how you,

3:17:37.040 --> 3:17:42.640
 and sort of the consumer idea of kind of the, it's the anti, you know, it's the opposite of the

3:17:42.640 --> 3:17:49.840
 Snapchat view of the world. There's a permanence to it that's heavily incentivized. And thereby,

3:17:49.840 --> 3:17:57.040
 you can have a permanence of history. Right. And that's kind of the, now, you know, so that's one

3:17:57.040 --> 3:18:01.280
 of the things we've been doing with Cardano. And it's kind of fun. I think that, I mean,

3:18:01.280 --> 3:18:05.360
 this whole question about, you know, you mentioned automated theorem proving and blockchains and

3:18:05.360 --> 3:18:09.760
 so on. And as I've thought about this kind of physics inspired distributed blockchain,

3:18:09.760 --> 3:18:15.280
 obviously, they're the sort of the proof that it works, that there are no double spends,

3:18:15.280 --> 3:18:21.200
 there's no whatever else. That proof becomes a very formal kind of almost a matter of physics,

3:18:21.200 --> 3:18:25.440
 so to speak. And, you know, it's been, it's been an interesting thing for the,

3:18:25.440 --> 3:18:30.240
 for the practical blockchains to do kind of actual automated theorem proving. And I don't

3:18:30.240 --> 3:18:34.560
 think anybody's really managed it in an interesting case yet. It's a thing that people,

3:18:34.560 --> 3:18:39.440
 you know, aspire to, but I think it's a challenging thing. Because basically the point is one of the,

3:18:39.440 --> 3:18:44.000
 one of the things about proving correctness of something is, well, you know, people say,

3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:47.760
 I've got this program, and I'm going to prove it's correct. And it's like, what does that mean?

3:18:47.760 --> 3:18:51.440
 You have to say what correct means. I mean, it's, it's kind of like, then you have to have

3:18:51.440 --> 3:18:56.000
 another language. And people are very confused back in past decades of, you know, oh, we're

3:18:56.000 --> 3:19:00.720
 going to prove the correctness by representing the program in another language, which we also

3:19:00.720 --> 3:19:05.440
 don't know whether it's correct. And, you know, often by correctness, we just mean it can't crash

3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:10.640
 or it can't scribble on memory. But, but the thing is that there's this complicated tradeoff.

3:19:10.640 --> 3:19:15.200
 Because as soon as there's, as soon as you're really using computation, you have computational

3:19:15.200 --> 3:19:21.040
 irreducibility, you have undecidability, if you want to use computation seriously, you have to

3:19:21.040 --> 3:19:26.880
 kind of let go of the idea that you're going to be able to box it in and say, we're going to have

3:19:26.880 --> 3:19:31.360
 just this happen and not anything else. I mean, this is a, this is an old fact. I mean, Goedl's

3:19:31.360 --> 3:19:37.680
 theorem tries to say, you know, piano arithmetic, the axioms of arithmetic, can you box in the integers

3:19:37.680 --> 3:19:42.000
 and say these axioms give just the integers and nothing but the integers? Goedl's theorem showed

3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:46.720
 that wasn't the case. There's a, you know, you can have all these wild, weird things that are

3:19:46.720 --> 3:19:51.360
 obey the piano axioms, but aren't integers. And there's this kind of infinite hierarchy

3:19:51.360 --> 3:19:56.080
 of additional axioms you would have to add. And it's kind of the same thing. You don't get to,

3:19:56.080 --> 3:20:00.560
 you know, if you want to say, I want to know what happens, you're boxing yourself in, and there's

3:20:00.560 --> 3:20:04.480
 a limit to what can happen, so to speak. So it's a, it's a complicated tradeoff. And it's a,

3:20:04.480 --> 3:20:09.200
 it's a, it's a big tradeoff for AI, so to speak. It's kind of like, do you want to let computation

3:20:09.200 --> 3:20:13.920
 actually do what it can do? Or do you want to say, no, it's very, very boxed in to the point

3:20:13.920 --> 3:20:19.120
 where we can understand every step. And that's a, that's kind of a thing that, that, that becomes

3:20:19.120 --> 3:20:24.640
 difficult to do. But that's some, I mean, in general, I would say one of the things that's

3:20:24.640 --> 3:20:30.080
 kind of complicated in my sort of life and the whole sort of story of computational language

3:20:30.080 --> 3:20:35.840
 and all this technology and science and so on. I mean, I kind of, in the flow of one's life,

3:20:35.840 --> 3:20:41.040
 it's sort of interesting to see how these things play out. Because I, you know, I've kind of concluded

3:20:41.040 --> 3:20:46.320
 that I'm in the business of making kind of artifacts from the future, which means, you know,

3:20:46.320 --> 3:20:49.680
 there are things that I've done, I don't know, this physics project, I don't know whether anybody

3:20:49.680 --> 3:20:54.560
 would have gotten to it for 50 years. You know, the fact that mathematics is a third of a century

3:20:54.560 --> 3:21:00.480
 old. And I know that a bunch of the core ideas are not well absorbed. I mean, that is, people

3:21:00.480 --> 3:21:05.360
 finally got this idea that I thought was a triviality of notebooks, that was 25 years.

3:21:05.360 --> 3:21:09.680
 And, you know, some of these core ideas about symbolic computation and so on,

3:21:09.680 --> 3:21:15.200
 are not, are not absorbed. I mean, people, people use them every day in Wolfram language,

3:21:15.200 --> 3:21:19.040
 and you know, do all kinds of cool things with them. But if you say, what is the fundamental

3:21:19.040 --> 3:21:23.680
 intellectual point here, it's, it's not well absorbed. And it's, it's something where you

3:21:23.680 --> 3:21:28.160
 kind of realize that you're, you're sort of building things. And I kind of made this, this

3:21:28.160 --> 3:21:31.680
 thing about, you know, we're building artifacts from the future, so to speak. And I mentioned that

3:21:31.680 --> 3:21:36.720
 it's our, we have a conference every, it's coming up actually in a couple of weeks, our annual

3:21:36.720 --> 3:21:42.480
 technology conference, where we talk about all the, all the things we're doing. And, you know,

3:21:42.480 --> 3:21:46.560
 so I was talking about it last year, about, you know, we're making artifacts from the future.

3:21:46.560 --> 3:21:51.600
 And I was kind of like, I had some, some version of that that was kind of a dark and frustrated

3:21:51.600 --> 3:21:55.280
 thing of like, you know, I'm building things which nobody's going to care about until long

3:21:55.280 --> 3:22:01.680
 after I'm dead, so to speak. But, but, but then I realized, you know, people were sort of telling

3:22:01.680 --> 3:22:06.640
 me afterwards, you know, that's exactly how, you know, we're using Wolfram language in some

3:22:06.640 --> 3:22:11.440
 particular setting in, you know, some computational X field or some organization or whatever. And

3:22:11.440 --> 3:22:16.000
 it's like people are saying, Oh, you know, what did you manage to do? You know, well, we know

3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:19.520
 that in principle, it will be possible to do that, but we didn't know that was possible now.

3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:23.200
 And it's kind of like that's the, that's sort of the business we're in. And in a sense,

3:22:23.200 --> 3:22:27.760
 with some of these ideas in science, you know, I feel a little bit the same way that there are

3:22:27.760 --> 3:22:33.520
 some of these things where, you know, some, some things like, for example, this whole idea, well,

3:22:33.520 --> 3:22:38.240
 so, so to, to relate to another sort of piece of history and the future, one of, you know,

3:22:38.240 --> 3:22:42.720
 I mentioned, we mentioned at the beginning kind of complexity as this thing that I was interested

3:22:42.720 --> 3:22:47.760
 in back 40 years ago and so on, where does complexity come from? Well, I think we kind of

3:22:47.760 --> 3:22:53.120
 nailed that. The answer is in the computational universe, even simple programs make it. And

3:22:53.120 --> 3:22:57.680
 that's kind of the secret the nature has that allows you to make it. So, so that's kind of the

3:22:58.720 --> 3:23:03.200
 that that's that part. But the bigger picture there was this idea of this kind of computational

3:23:03.200 --> 3:23:07.760
 paradigm, the idea that you could go beyond mathematical equations, which have been sort of

3:23:07.760 --> 3:23:14.560
 the primary modeling medium for 300 years. And so it was like, look, it is inexorably the case

3:23:14.560 --> 3:23:19.040
 that people will use programs, rather than just equations. And, you know, I was saying that in

3:23:19.040 --> 3:23:24.000
 the 1980s. And people were, you know, I published my big book, New Kind of Science, that'll be 20

3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:30.240
 years ago, next year. So in 2002, and people are saying, Oh, no, this can't possibly be true. You

3:23:30.240 --> 3:23:35.840
 know, we know, for 300 years, we've been doing all this stuff, right? To be fair, I now realize

3:23:35.840 --> 3:23:40.640
 on a little bit more analysis of what people actually said, in pretty much every field other

3:23:40.640 --> 3:23:46.640
 than physics, people said, Oh, these are new models, that's pretty interesting. In physics,

3:23:46.640 --> 3:23:49.680
 people were like, we've got our physics models, we're very happy with them.

3:23:49.680 --> 3:23:54.800
 Yeah, in physics, there's more resistance because of the attachment and the power of the equations,

3:23:54.800 --> 3:24:00.480
 right? The idea that programs might be the right way to approach, right, this field was,

3:24:00.480 --> 3:24:05.920
 there's some resistance and like you're saying, it takes time for somebody who likes the idea of

3:24:05.920 --> 3:24:09.520
 time dilation and all these applications, I thought you would understand this.

3:24:09.520 --> 3:24:12.560
 Yeah, right. But you know, and computational irreducibility,

3:24:12.560 --> 3:24:18.800
 yes, exactly. But I mean, it is really interesting that just 20 years, a span of 20 years,

3:24:18.800 --> 3:24:26.400
 it's gone from, you know, pitchforks and horror to, yeah, we get it. And, you know, it's helped

3:24:26.400 --> 3:24:31.840
 that we've, you know, in our current effort in fundamental physics, we've gotten a lot further,

3:24:31.840 --> 3:24:37.040
 and we've managed to put a lot of puzzle pieces together, that makes sense. But the thing that

3:24:37.040 --> 3:24:42.480
 I've been thinking about recently is this field of complexity. So I've kind of was a sort of a

3:24:42.480 --> 3:24:49.520
 field builder back in the 1980s, I was kind of like, okay, you know, can we, you know, I'd

3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:53.120
 understood this point that there was this sort of fundamental phenomenon of complexity, it showed up

3:24:53.120 --> 3:24:58.400
 in lots of places. And I was like, this is an interesting sort of field of science. And I was

3:24:59.040 --> 3:25:05.520
 recently was reminded I was at this, the very first sort of get together of what became the

3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:10.000
 Santa Fe Institute. And I was like, in fact, there's even an audio recording of me sort of

3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:14.320
 saying, people have been talking about, oh, what should this, you know, outfit do? And I was saying,

3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:18.320
 well, there is this thing that I've been thinking about, it's this kind of idea of complexity.

3:25:18.320 --> 3:25:22.480
 Nice. And it's kind of like, and that's, that's what that ended up.

3:25:22.480 --> 3:25:26.640
 And you planted the seed of complexity to Santa Fe. That's beautiful. It's a beautiful vision.

3:25:26.640 --> 3:25:31.600
 But I mean, so that, but what's happened then, is this idea of complexity and, you know,

3:25:31.600 --> 3:25:35.920
 can, you know, and I started the first research center at University of Illinois for doing that

3:25:35.920 --> 3:25:42.400
 in the first journal, complex systems and so on. And, and it's kind of an interesting thing in my

3:25:42.400 --> 3:25:47.280
 life, at least that it's kind of like, you plant the seed, you have this idea, it's a kind of a

3:25:47.280 --> 3:25:52.080
 science idea, you have this idea of sort of focusing on the phenomenon of complexity. The

3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:57.280
 deeper idea was this computational paradigm. But the nominal idea is this kind of idea of

3:25:57.280 --> 3:26:02.880
 complexity. Okay, then you roll time forward 30 years or whatever, 35 years, whatever it is.

3:26:03.680 --> 3:26:08.400
 And you say, what happened? Okay, well, now there are 1000 complexity institutes around the world.

3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:14.320
 I think, more or less, we've been trying to count them. And, you know, there are 40 complexity

3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:20.720
 journals, I think. And so it's kind of like, what actually happened in this field? Right.

3:26:20.720 --> 3:26:25.520
 And I look at a lot of what happened. And I'm like, you know, I have to admit,

3:26:25.520 --> 3:26:31.040
 there's some eye rolling, so to speak. Because it's kind of like, like, what is what's what's

3:26:31.040 --> 3:26:35.920
 actually going on? Well, what people definitely got was this idea of computational models.

3:26:36.480 --> 3:26:40.800
 And then they got but they thought one of the one of the kind of cognitive mistakes, I think,

3:26:40.800 --> 3:26:46.960
 is they say, we've got a computational model. And it's, and we're looking at a system that's

3:26:46.960 --> 3:26:52.640
 complex. And our computational model gives complexity by golly, that must mean it's right.

3:26:52.640 --> 3:26:58.000
 And unfortunately, because complexity is a generic phenomenon and computational irreducibility

3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:02.800
 is a generic phenomenon that actually tells you nothing. And so then the question is, well,

3:27:02.800 --> 3:27:06.720
 what can you do? You know, there's a lot of things that have been sort of done under this banner

3:27:06.720 --> 3:27:11.440
 of complexity. And I think it's been very successful in providing sort of an interdisciplinary

3:27:11.440 --> 3:27:15.760
 way of connecting different fields together, which is powerful in itself. Right. I mean,

3:27:15.760 --> 3:27:20.960
 that's a very useful economics. And yeah, it is. It's a good organizing principle. But in the end,

3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:25.840
 a lot of that is around the sort of computational paradigm, computational modeling. That's the

3:27:25.840 --> 3:27:30.960
 raw material that powers that kind of that kind of correspondence, I think. But the question is

3:27:30.960 --> 3:27:36.400
 sort of what is the, you know, I was just thinking recently, you know, we've been, I mean, the other

3:27:36.400 --> 3:27:40.960
 we've been, we've been for years, people have told me, you should start some Wolfram Institute

3:27:40.960 --> 3:27:46.000
 that does basic science. You know, all I have is a company that that builds software and we,

3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:50.000
 you know, we have a little piece that does basic science as kind of a hobby. People are saying,

3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:54.160
 you should start this Wolfram Institute thing. And, and I've been, you know, because I've known

3:27:54.160 --> 3:27:58.080
 about lots of institutes, and I've seen kind of that flow of money and, and kind of, you know,

3:27:58.080 --> 3:28:02.480
 what happens in different situations and so on. So I've been kind of reluctant, but, but I've,

3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:07.120
 I've, I have realized that, you know, what we've done with our company over the last 35 years,

3:28:07.120 --> 3:28:12.800
 you know, we built a very good machine for doing R&D and, you know, innovating and creating things.

3:28:12.800 --> 3:28:17.600
 And I just applied that machine to the physics project. That's how we did the physics project

3:28:17.600 --> 3:28:23.200
 in a fairly short amount of time with a, you know, efficient machine with, you know, various people

3:28:23.200 --> 3:28:29.440
 involved and so on. And so, you know, it works for basic science. And it's like, we can do more of

3:28:29.440 --> 3:28:35.440
 this. And so now... In biology and chemistry, so it's become an institute. Yes. Well, it needs to

3:28:35.440 --> 3:28:40.080
 become an institute. An official institute. Right. But the thing that, so I was thinking about,

3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:45.280
 okay, so what do we do with complexity? You know, what, what, there are all these people who've,

3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:49.920
 you know, what, what should happen to that field? And what I realized is, there's kind of this area

3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:55.360
 of foundations of complexity that's about these questions about simple programs, what they do,

3:28:55.360 --> 3:28:58.960
 that's far away from a bunch of the detailed applications that people... Oh, it's not far away.

3:28:58.960 --> 3:29:05.040
 It's the, it's the under, you know, the bedrock underneath those applications. And so I realized

3:29:05.040 --> 3:29:12.400
 recently, this is my recent kind of little innovation of a sort, a post that I'll do very soon,

3:29:12.400 --> 3:29:20.400
 the, about kind of, you know, the foundations of complexity, what really are they? I think

3:29:20.400 --> 3:29:26.480
 they're really two ideas, two conceptual ideas that I hadn't really enunciated, I think, before.

3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:32.160
 One is what I call metamodeling. The other is rulliology. So what is metamodeling? So metamodeling

3:29:32.160 --> 3:29:36.720
 is, you've got this complicated model, and it's a model of, you know, hedgehogs interacting with

3:29:36.720 --> 3:29:41.680
 this, interacting with that. And the question is, what's really underneath that? What is it?

3:29:41.680 --> 3:29:45.600
 You know, is it a Turing machine? Is it a cellular automaton? You know,

3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:51.120
 what is the underlying stuff underneath that model? And so there's this kind of meta science

3:29:51.120 --> 3:29:56.560
 question of, given these models, what is the core model? And I realized, I mean, to me,

3:29:56.560 --> 3:30:00.880
 that's sort of an obvious question. But then I realized, I've been doing language design for 40

3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:05.120
 years. And language design is exactly that question, you know, underneath all of this

3:30:05.120 --> 3:30:10.080
 detailed stuff people do, what are the underlying primitives? And that's a question people haven't

3:30:10.080 --> 3:30:13.920
 tended to ask about models. They say, well, we've got this nice model for this and that and the

3:30:13.920 --> 3:30:18.640
 other. What's really underneath it? And what, you know, because once you have the thing that's

3:30:18.640 --> 3:30:24.000
 underneath it, well, for example, this multi computation idea is an ultimate metamodeling

3:30:24.000 --> 3:30:29.680
 idea, because it's saying underneath all these fields is one kind of paradigmatic structure.

3:30:29.680 --> 3:30:33.280
 And, you know, you can, you can imagine the same kind of thing, much more sort of,

3:30:33.280 --> 3:30:40.560
 much sort of shallower levels in different kinds of modeling. So the first activity is this kind

3:30:40.560 --> 3:30:46.720
 of metamodeling, the kind of the models about models, so to speak, you know, what is the,

3:30:47.280 --> 3:30:51.840
 what's, you know, drilling down into models? That's one thing. The other thing is this,

3:30:51.840 --> 3:30:56.880
 this thing that I think we're going to call Ruleology, which is kind of the, okay, you've got

3:30:56.880 --> 3:31:00.640
 these simple rules, you've got cellular automata, you've got Turing machines, you've got substitution

3:31:00.640 --> 3:31:04.160
 systems, you've got register machines, you've got all these different things. What do they actually

3:31:04.160 --> 3:31:09.760
 do in the wild? And this is an area that I've spent a lot of time, you know, working on and

3:31:09.760 --> 3:31:14.400
 it's a lot of stuff in my new kind of science book is about this, you know, this new book I wrote

3:31:14.400 --> 3:31:20.080
 about combinators is, is full of stuff like this. And, and this journal complex systems has lots of

3:31:20.080 --> 3:31:24.480
 papers about these kinds of things. But, but there isn't really a home for people who do

3:31:24.480 --> 3:31:31.440
 Ruleology or what I'm not. As you call the basic science of rules. Yes. Yes. Right. So it's, it's

3:31:31.440 --> 3:31:36.640
 like, you've got some, what is it? Is it mathematics? No, it isn't really like mathematics. In fact,

3:31:36.640 --> 3:31:41.760
 from my now understanding of mathematics, I understand that it's the molecular dynamics level.

3:31:41.760 --> 3:31:46.080
 It's not the level that mathematicians have traditionally cared about. It's not computer

3:31:46.080 --> 3:31:50.240
 science, because computer science is about writing programs that do things, you know,

3:31:50.240 --> 3:31:54.960
 that were for a purpose, not programs in the wild, so to speak. It's not physics, it doesn't have

3:31:54.960 --> 3:31:59.360
 anything to do with, you know, it may be underneath some physics, but it's not physics as such.

3:31:59.360 --> 3:32:04.400
 So it just hasn't had a home. And if you look at, you know, but what's great about it is,

3:32:05.120 --> 3:32:09.760
 it's a surviving field, so to speak. It's, it's something where, you know, one of the things I,

3:32:09.760 --> 3:32:15.280
 I find sort of inspiring about mathematics, for example, is you look at mathematics that was done,

3:32:15.280 --> 3:32:20.640
 you know, in ancient Greece, ancient, you know, Babylon, Egypt and so on, it's still here today.

3:32:20.640 --> 3:32:25.280
 You know, you find an icosahedron that somebody made in ancient Egypt, you look at it, oh,

3:32:25.280 --> 3:32:31.520
 that's a very modern thing. It's an icosahedron, you know, it's a timeless kind of, kind of activity.

3:32:31.520 --> 3:32:36.640
 And this idea of studying simple rules and what they do, it's a timeless activity. And I can see

3:32:36.640 --> 3:32:42.400
 that over the last 40 years or so, as, you know, even with cellular automata, it's kind of like,

3:32:42.400 --> 3:32:46.960
 you know, you can sort of catalog what, what are the different cellular automata used for.

3:32:46.960 --> 3:32:52.480
 And, you know, like the simplest rules, like, like one, you might even know this one, rule 184.

3:32:52.480 --> 3:32:57.040
 It's rule 184 is a minimal model for road traffic flow. And, you know, it's also a

3:32:57.040 --> 3:33:01.200
 minimal model for various other things. But it's kind of fun that you can literally say,

3:33:01.200 --> 3:33:07.040
 you know, rule 90 is a minimal model for this and this and this. Rule four is a minimal model for

3:33:07.040 --> 3:33:12.160
 this. And it's kind of remarkable that you can just buy in this raw level of this kind of study

3:33:12.160 --> 3:33:17.360
 of rules. They then branch, they're the raw material that you can use to make models of

3:33:17.360 --> 3:33:22.240
 different things. So it's a, it's a very pure basic science. But it's one that, you know,

3:33:22.240 --> 3:33:26.560
 people have explored it, but they've been kind of a little bit in the wilderness. And I think,

3:33:26.560 --> 3:33:31.840
 you know, one of the things that I would like to do finally is, is, you know, I always thought that

3:33:31.840 --> 3:33:37.200
 sort of this notion of pure and chaos, pure and chaos being the acronym for my book, New Kind of

3:33:37.200 --> 3:33:43.440
 Science, was, was something that people should be doing. And, you know, we tried to figure out

3:33:43.440 --> 3:33:47.360
 what's the right institutional structure to do this stuff. You know, we, we dealt with a bunch

3:33:47.360 --> 3:33:51.360
 of universities. Oh, you know, can we do this here? Well, what department would be in it? Well,

3:33:51.360 --> 3:33:56.080
 it isn't in a department. It's, it's its own new kind of thing. That's why, that's why the book was

3:33:56.080 --> 3:34:01.600
 called the New Kind of Science. It's kind of the, the, because that's an increasingly good description

3:34:01.600 --> 3:34:07.280
 of what it is, so to speak. We're actually, we were thinking about kind of the rheological society,

3:34:07.280 --> 3:34:11.840
 because we're realizing that it's kind of, it's, it's some, you know, there's a, there's a, it's

3:34:11.840 --> 3:34:15.200
 very, it's very interesting. I mean, I've never really done something like this before, because

3:34:15.200 --> 3:34:19.920
 there's this whole group of researchers who are, who've been doing things that are really,

3:34:20.640 --> 3:34:25.680
 in some cases, very elegant, very surviving, very solid, you know, here's this thing that

3:34:25.680 --> 3:34:31.760
 happens in this very abstract system. But it's like, it's like, what is that part of, you know, it's,

3:34:31.760 --> 3:34:36.880
 it doesn't have a home. And I think that's something I, you know, I kind of fault myself for not

3:34:36.880 --> 3:34:42.640
 having been more, you know, when complexity was developing in the 80s, I didn't understand the,

3:34:42.640 --> 3:34:48.000
 the, the danger of applications. That is, it's really cool that you can apply this to economics,

3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:52.640
 and you can apply it to evolutionary biology, and this and that and the other. But what happens

3:34:52.640 --> 3:34:56.880
 with applications is everything gets sucked into the applications. And the pure stuff,

3:34:56.880 --> 3:35:01.520
 it's like the pure mathematics, there isn't any pure mathematics, so to speak. It's all just

3:35:01.520 --> 3:35:08.240
 applications of mathematics. And I, I failed to kind of make sure that this kind of pure area was,

3:35:08.240 --> 3:35:13.520
 was kind of maintained and, and, and developed. And I think now, you know, one of the things I,

3:35:13.520 --> 3:35:18.080
 I want to try to do, and, and, you know, it's a funny thing because I'm used to, look, I've been a,

3:35:18.080 --> 3:35:23.680
 a tech CEO for more than half my life now. So, you know, this is what I know how to do. And, you

3:35:23.680 --> 3:35:28.800
 know, I can, I can make stuff happen, and get projects to happen, even as it turns out, basic

3:35:28.800 --> 3:35:34.880
 science projects, in that kind of setting, and how that translates into kind of, you know,

3:35:34.880 --> 3:35:38.160
 there are a lot of people working on, for example, our physics project sort of distributed through

3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:42.800
 the academic world, and that's working just great. But the question is, you know, can we have a sort

3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:49.200
 of accelerator mechanism that makes use of kind of what we've learned in, in sort of R&D innovation?

3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:54.080
 And, you know, but on the other hand, it's a funny thing because, you know, in a company,

3:35:54.080 --> 3:35:58.480
 in the end, the thing is, you know, it's a company, it makes products that sell things,

3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:03.360
 sells things to people. In, you know, when you're doing basic research, one of the challenges is

3:36:03.360 --> 3:36:08.640
 there isn't that same kind of, of sort of mechanism. And so it's, it's, it's, you know, how do you

3:36:08.640 --> 3:36:14.320
 drive the thing in a, in a kind of, in a lead kind of way, so that it really can, can make

3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:19.280
 forward progress rather than, you know, what can often happen in, you know, in academic settings

3:36:19.280 --> 3:36:23.920
 where it's like, well, there are all these flowers blooming, but it's not clear that there, you know,

3:36:23.920 --> 3:36:28.800
 that it's, you have to have a central mission and a drive, just like you do with the company

3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:33.920
 that's delivering a big overarching product. And that's, that's, but the challenges, you know,

3:36:33.920 --> 3:36:39.600
 when you have a, the, the, the economics of the world are such that, you know, when you're delivering

3:36:39.600 --> 3:36:43.920
 a product and people say, wow, that's useful, we'll buy it. And then that kind of feeds back

3:36:43.920 --> 3:36:48.960
 in, okay, then you can, then you can pay the people who build it to eat, you know, so they can eat

3:36:48.960 --> 3:36:56.160
 and so on. And with basic science, the payoff is very much less visible. And, and, you know,

3:36:56.160 --> 3:37:00.000
 with the physics project, as I say, the big surprise has been that, I mean, you know,

3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:05.920
 for example, well, the big surprise with the physics project is that it's looks like it has

3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:11.760
 near term applications. And I was like, I'm guessing this is 200 years away. It's, I was kind of using

3:37:11.760 --> 3:37:17.440
 the analogy of, of, you know, Newton, starting a satellite launch company, which would have been

3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:23.200
 kind of wrong time. And, you know, but, but it turns out that's not the case. But, but we can't

3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:28.480
 guarantee that. And if you say, we're signing up to do basic research, basic rheology, let's say.

3:37:28.480 --> 3:37:34.480
 And, you know, and we can't, we don't know the horizon, you know, it's an unknown horizon. It's

3:37:34.480 --> 3:37:39.360
 kind of like an undecidable kind of proposition of when is this proof going to end, so to speak?

3:37:39.360 --> 3:37:46.320
 When is it going to be something that, that they get supplied? Well, I hope this is, this becomes a

3:37:46.320 --> 3:37:52.880
 vibrant new field of rheology. I love it. Like I told you many, many times, it's one of the most

3:37:52.880 --> 3:37:59.120
 amazing ideas that has been brought to this world. So I hope you get a bunch of people to explore

3:37:59.120 --> 3:38:06.960
 this world. Thank you once again for spending a really valuable time with me today. Fun stuff. Thank

3:38:06.960 --> 3:38:12.480
 you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Stephen Wolfram. To support this podcast,

3:38:12.480 --> 3:38:17.600
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

3:38:17.600 --> 3:38:25.760
 Richard Feynman. Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns. So each small piece

3:38:25.760 --> 3:38:32.320
 of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry. Thank you for listening and hope

3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:49.120
 to see you next time.
