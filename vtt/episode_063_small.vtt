00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
 The following is a conversation with Steven Kotkin, a professor of history at Princeton University

00:05.360 --> 00:10.960
 and one of the great historians of our time, specializing in Russian and Soviet history.

00:10.960 --> 00:15.520
 He has written many books on Stalin in the Soviet Union, including the first two of

00:15.520 --> 00:19.760
 the three volume work on Stalin, and he is currently working on volume three.

00:20.800 --> 00:24.320
 He may have noticed that I've been speaking with not just computer scientists,

00:24.320 --> 00:28.880
 but physicists, engineers, historians, neuroscientists, and soon much more.

00:28.880 --> 00:34.400
 To me, artificial intelligence is much bigger than deep learning, bigger than computing.

00:34.400 --> 00:40.160
 It is our civilization's journey into understanding the human mind and creating echoes of it in the

00:40.160 --> 00:48.880
 machine. To me, that journey must include a deep historical and psychological understanding of power.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.520
 Technology puts some of the greatest power in the history of our civilization

00:53.520 --> 00:58.400
 into the hands of engineers and computer scientists. This power must not be abused,

00:59.120 --> 01:03.920
 and the best way to understand how such abuse can be avoided is to not be blind

01:03.920 --> 01:11.920
 to the lessons of history. As Steven Kotkin brilliantly articulates, Stalin was arguably one of

01:11.920 --> 01:18.320
 the most powerful humans in history. I've read many books on Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Putin,

01:18.320 --> 01:24.000
 and the wars of the 20th century. I hope you understand the value of such knowledge to all of

01:24.000 --> 01:29.920
 us, especially to engineers and scientists who build the tools of power in the 21st century.

 I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction. I'll do one or two minutes after

01:51.200 --> 01:56.320
 introducing the episode and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.

 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store. I personally use

02:06.720 --> 02:11.600
 Cash App to send money to friends, but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin

02:11.600 --> 02:17.120
 just seconds. Cash App also has an investing feature. You can buy fractions of a stock,

02:17.120 --> 02:22.720
 say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is. Broker services are provided by Cash App

02:22.720 --> 02:29.360
 Investing, a subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC. I'm excited to be working with Cash App

02:29.360 --> 02:34.320
 to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST, best known for their FIRST Robotics and

02:34.320 --> 02:40.320
 Lego competitions. They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students in over 110

02:40.320 --> 02:45.600
 countries and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator, which means the donated money is used

02:45.600 --> 02:51.520
 to maximum effectiveness. When you get Cash App from the App Store at Google Play and use code

02:51.520 --> 02:57.920
 LEX Podcast, you'll get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, which again is an

02:57.920 --> 03:04.000
 organization that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better

03:04.000 --> 03:12.800
 world. And now, here's my conversation with Steven Kotkin. Do all human beings crave power?

03:14.000 --> 03:21.120
 No. Human beings crave security. They crave love. They crave adventure.

03:22.640 --> 03:29.680
 They crave power, but not equally. Some human beings nevertheless do crave power.

03:29.680 --> 03:36.480
 For sure. Word is that deeply in the psychology of people? Is it something you're born with? Is

03:36.480 --> 03:44.880
 it something you develop? Some people crave a position of leadership or of standing out,

03:44.880 --> 03:53.200
 of being recognized. And that could be starting out in the school years, on the schoolyard.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.720
 It could be within their own family, not just in their peer group.

03:56.720 --> 04:03.440
 Those kind of people we often see craving leadership positions from a young age

04:04.160 --> 04:08.880
 often end up in positions of power, but they can be varied positions of power.

04:09.520 --> 04:14.080
 You can have power in an institution where your power is purposefully limited.

04:15.200 --> 04:22.240
 For example, there's a board or a consultative body or a separation of powers. Not everyone craves

04:22.240 --> 04:29.920
 power whereby they're the sole power or their unconstrained power. That's a little bit less

04:29.920 --> 04:37.520
 usual. We may think that everybody does, but not everybody does. Those people who do crave

04:37.520 --> 04:45.920
 that kind of power, unconstrained the ability to decide as much as life or death of other people,

04:45.920 --> 04:53.440
 most people are not everyday people. They're not the people you encounter in your daily life,

04:53.440 --> 04:59.600
 for the most part. Those are extraordinary people. Most of them don't have the opportunity

04:59.600 --> 05:05.280
 to live that dream. Very few of them, in fact, end up with the opportunity to live that dream.

05:05.280 --> 05:10.400
 So percentage wise, in your sense, if we think of George Washington, for example,

05:10.400 --> 05:18.480
 most would most people given the choice of absolute power over a country versus maybe

05:19.280 --> 05:25.280
 the capped power that the United States presidential role, at least at the founding

05:25.280 --> 05:28.640
 of the country, represented, what do you think most people would choose?

05:29.600 --> 05:34.480
 Well, Washington was in a position to exercise far greater power than he did.

05:34.480 --> 05:45.360
 And in fact, he didn't take that option. He was more interested in seeing institutionalization,

05:46.640 --> 05:52.320
 of seeing the country develop strong institutions rather than an individual leader like himself

05:52.320 --> 05:59.200
 have excess power. So that's very important. So like I said, not everyone craves unconstrained

05:59.200 --> 06:04.240
 power even if they're very ambitious. And of course, Washington was very ambitious. He was a

06:04.240 --> 06:11.840
 successful general before he was a president. So that clearly comes from the influences on your

06:11.840 --> 06:18.960
 life, where you grow up, how you grow up, how you raised, what kind of values are imparted to you

06:18.960 --> 06:26.240
 along the way. You can understand power as the ability to share, or you can understand

06:26.240 --> 06:31.920
 or the ability to advance something for the collective in a collective process,

06:31.920 --> 06:36.400
 not an individual process. So power comes in many different varieties.

06:37.680 --> 06:44.480
 And ambition doesn't always equate to despotic power. Despotic power is something

06:45.360 --> 06:53.600
 different from ordinary institutional power that we see. The president of MIT does not have

06:53.600 --> 07:01.760
 unconstrained power. The president of MIT rightly must consult with other members of the administration,

07:01.760 --> 07:07.280
 with the faculty members, to a certain extent with the student body, and certainly with the

07:07.280 --> 07:16.080
 trustees of MIT. Those constraints make the institution strong and enduring and make the

07:16.080 --> 07:22.000
 decisions better than they would be if he had unconstrained power. But you can't say that the

07:22.000 --> 07:29.440
 president is not ambitious. Of course, the president is ambitious. We worry about unconstrained power.

07:29.440 --> 07:35.920
 We worry about executive authority that's not limited. That's the definition of authoritarianism

07:35.920 --> 07:44.240
 or tyranny. Unlimited or barely limited executive authority. Executive authority is necessary to

07:44.240 --> 07:50.160
 carry out many functions. We all understand that. That's why MIT has an executive, has a president.

07:50.160 --> 08:00.640
 But unlimited or largely unconstrained executive power is detrimental to even the person who

08:00.640 --> 08:07.520
 exercises that power. So what do you think? It's an interesting notion. We kind of take it for granted

08:07.520 --> 08:14.560
 that constraints on executive power is a good thing. But why is that necessarily true? So what

08:14.560 --> 08:24.240
 is it about absolute power that does something bad to the human mind? The popular saying of absolute

08:24.240 --> 08:31.920
 power corrupts absolutely. Is that the case? That the power in itself is the thing that

08:32.800 --> 08:37.680
 corrupts the mind in some kind of way where it leads to a bad leadership over time?

08:38.640 --> 08:43.840
 People make more mistakes when they're not challenged, when they don't have to explain

08:43.840 --> 08:51.200
 things and get others to vote and go along with it, when they can make a decision without anybody

08:51.200 --> 08:57.840
 being able to block their decision or to have input necessarily on their decision. You're more

08:57.840 --> 09:05.440
 prone to mistakes. You're more prone to extremism. There's a temptation there. For example, we have

09:05.440 --> 09:14.720
 separation of powers in the United States. The Congress has authority that the president doesn't

09:14.720 --> 09:20.800
 have, as for example, in budgeting the so called power of the purse. This can be very frustrating.

09:21.440 --> 09:26.480
 People want to see things happen, and they complain that there's a do nothing Congress or

09:26.480 --> 09:34.560
 that the situation is stalemated. But actually that's potentially a good thing. In fact, that's

09:34.560 --> 09:41.120
 how our system was designed. Our system was designed to prevent things happening in government.

09:42.320 --> 09:47.600
 There's frustration with that, but ultimately that's the strength of the institutions we have.

09:48.560 --> 09:54.880
 When you see unconstrained executive authority, there can be a lot of dynamism, a lot of things

09:54.880 --> 10:00.800
 can get done quickly, but those things can be like, for example, what happened in China under Mao

10:00.800 --> 10:06.240
 Mao, or what happened in the Soviet Union under Stalin, or what happened in Haiti under

10:06.960 --> 10:13.280
 Papa Doc and then Baby Doc, or fill in the blank. What happens sometimes in corporations where a

10:13.280 --> 10:20.720
 corporate leader is not constrained by the shareholders, by the board, or by anything,

10:21.440 --> 10:25.680
 and they can seem to be a genius for a while, but eventually it catches up to them.

10:25.680 --> 10:32.560
 And so the idea of constraints on executive power is absolutely fundamental to the American

10:32.560 --> 10:40.400
 system, American way of thinking, and not only America, obviously large other parts of the world

10:41.040 --> 10:46.400
 that have a similar system, not an identical system, but a similar system of checks and balances

10:46.400 --> 10:54.160
 on executive power. And so the case that I study, the only checks and balances on executive power

10:54.160 --> 11:02.960
 are circumstantial. So for example, distances in the country, it's hard to do something over 5,000

11:02.960 --> 11:09.360
 miles, or the amount of time in a day, it's hard for a leader to get to every single thing the

11:09.360 --> 11:15.120
 leader wants to get to because there are only 24 hours in a day. Those are circumstantial constraints

11:15.120 --> 11:21.840
 on executive power. They're not institutional constraints on executive power. One of the constraints

11:21.840 --> 11:27.600
 on executive power that the United States has versus Russia, maybe something you've

11:27.600 --> 11:31.840
 implied and actually spoke directly to is there's something in the Russian people and the Soviet

11:31.840 --> 11:39.680
 people that are attracted to authoritarian power, psychologically speaking, or at least the kind

11:39.680 --> 11:48.000
 of leaders that sought authoritarian power throughout its history. And that desire for that

11:48.000 --> 11:53.840
 kind of human is a lack of a constraint. In America, it seems as people we desire

11:55.360 --> 12:00.080
 somebody not like Stalin, somebody more like George Washington. So that's another constraint,

12:00.720 --> 12:05.600
 the belief of the people, what they admire in a leader, what they seek in a leader.

12:06.480 --> 12:14.560
 So maybe you can speak to, well, first of all, can you speak briefly to that psychology of

12:14.560 --> 12:21.280
 is there a difference between the Russian people and the American people in terms of just what we

12:21.280 --> 12:28.960
 find attractive in a leader? Not as great a difference as it might seem. There are, unfortunately,

12:28.960 --> 12:35.920
 many Americans who would be happy with an authoritarian leader in the country. It's

12:35.920 --> 12:42.560
 by no means a majority. It's not even a plurality. But nonetheless, it's a real sentiment in the

12:42.560 --> 12:49.120
 population. Sometimes because they feel frustrated, because things are not getting done. Sometimes

12:49.120 --> 12:55.040
 because they're against something that's happening in the political realm, and they feel it has to

12:55.040 --> 13:01.040
 be corrected and corrected quickly. It's a kind of impulse. People can regret the impulse later

13:01.040 --> 13:08.560
 on that the impulse is motivated by reaction to their environment. In the Russian case, we have

13:08.560 --> 13:15.200
 also people who crave, sometimes known as a strong hand and iron hand and authoritarian leader,

13:15.840 --> 13:22.240
 because they want things to be done and be done more quickly that align with their desires.

13:23.200 --> 13:29.280
 But I'm not sure it's a majority in the country today. Certainly in Stalin's time,

13:30.080 --> 13:36.080
 this was a widespread sentiment, and people had few alternatives that they understood or could

13:36.080 --> 13:43.360
 appeal to. Nowadays, in the globalized world, the citizens of Russia can see how other systems have

13:43.360 --> 13:49.200
 constraints on executive power, and the life isn't so bad there. In fact, the life might even be

13:49.200 --> 13:58.880
 better. So the impatience, the impulsive quality, the frustration does sometimes, and people reinforce

13:58.880 --> 14:06.240
 their craving for the unconstrained executive to, quote, get things done or shake things up or

14:07.120 --> 14:13.440
 yes, that's true. But in the Russian case, I'm not sure it's cultural today. I think it might be more

14:14.320 --> 14:22.320
 having to do with the failures, the functional failures of the kind of political system that

14:22.320 --> 14:31.280
 they tried to institute after the Soviet collapse. And so it may be frustration with the version of

14:31.280 --> 14:36.800
 constraints on executive power they got and how it didn't work the way it was imagined,

14:37.760 --> 14:47.040
 which has led to a sense in which non constrained executive power could fix things. But I'm not

14:47.040 --> 14:52.400
 sure that that's a majority sentiment in the Russian case, although it's hard to measure because

14:52.400 --> 15:01.120
 under authoritarian regimes, a public opinion is shaped by the environment in which people live,

15:01.120 --> 15:08.320
 which is very constrained in terms of public opinion. But on that point, why, at least from a

15:08.320 --> 15:13.200
 distance, does there seem to nevertheless be support for the current Russian president,

15:13.200 --> 15:21.680
 Vladimir Putin? Is that have to do with the fact that measuring, getting good metrics and

15:21.680 --> 15:27.440
 statistics on support is difficult in authoritarian governments? Or is there still something appealing

15:28.000 --> 15:33.840
 to that kind of power to the people? I think we have to give credit to President Putin for

15:33.840 --> 15:42.480
 understanding the psychology of the Russians who to whom he appeals. Many of them were the

15:42.480 --> 15:49.440
 losers in the transition from communism. They were the ones whose pensions were destroyed by

15:49.440 --> 15:55.680
 inflation or whose salaries didn't go up or whose regions were abandoned. They were not

15:55.680 --> 16:01.280
 the winners for the most part. And so I think there's an understanding on his part of their

16:01.280 --> 16:06.960
 psychology. Putin has grown in the position. He was not a public politician when he first started

16:06.960 --> 16:13.120
 out. He was quite poor in public settings. He didn't have the kind of political instincts

16:13.120 --> 16:18.960
 that he has now. He didn't have the appeal to traditional values and the Orthodox Church and

16:18.960 --> 16:28.560
 some of the other dimensions of his rule today. So yes, we have to give some credit to Putin himself

16:28.560 --> 16:35.120
 for this, in addition to the frustrations and the mass of the people. But let's think about it

16:35.120 --> 16:41.280
 this way, in addition, without taking away the fact that he's become a better retail politician

16:41.280 --> 16:47.920
 over time and that sentiment has shifted because of the disappointments with the transition with

16:47.920 --> 17:00.240
 the population. When I ask my kids, am I a good dad? My kids don't have any other dad to measure me

17:00.240 --> 17:08.800
 against. I'm the only dad they know and I'm the only dad they can choose or not choose. If they

17:08.800 --> 17:17.920
 don't choose me, they still get me as dad. So with Putin today, he's the only dad that the Russian

17:17.920 --> 17:24.000
 people have. Now, if my kids were introduced to alternative fathers, they might be better than

17:24.000 --> 17:32.800
 me. They might be more loving, more giving, funnier, richer, whatever it might be, they might be more

17:32.800 --> 17:38.960
 appealing. There are some blood ties there, for sure, that I have with my kids, but they would at

17:38.960 --> 17:47.200
 least be able to choose alternatives and then I would have to win their favor in that constellation

17:47.200 --> 17:53.120
 of alternatives. If President Putin were up against real alternatives, if the population

17:53.120 --> 18:00.160
 had real choice and that choice could express itself and have resources and have media and

18:00.160 --> 18:07.680
 everything else the way he does, maybe he would be very popular and maybe his popularity would not

18:07.680 --> 18:15.600
 be as great as it currently is. So the absence of alternatives is another factor that reinforces

18:15.600 --> 18:22.320
 his authority and his popularity. Having said that, there are many authoritarian leaders

18:23.040 --> 18:30.720
 who deny any alternatives to the population and are not very popular. So denial of alternatives

18:30.720 --> 18:36.800
 doesn't guarantee you the popularity. You still have to figure out the mass psychology and be able

18:36.800 --> 18:47.200
 to appeal to it. In the Russian case, the winners from the transition live primarily in the big

18:47.200 --> 18:59.040
 cities and are self employed or entrepreneurial. Even if they're not self employed, they're able

18:59.040 --> 19:07.040
 to change careers. They have tremendous skills and talent and education and knowledge, as well as

19:07.760 --> 19:14.480
 these entrepreneurial or dynamic personalities. Putin also appealed to them. He did that with

19:14.480 --> 19:23.360
 Medvedev and it was a very clever ruse. He himself appealed to the losers from the transition,

19:23.360 --> 19:32.480
 the small towns, the rural, the people who were not well off, and he had them for the most part.

19:32.480 --> 19:37.040
 Not all. We don't want to generalize to say that he had every one of them because those people have

19:37.040 --> 19:43.360
 views of their own, sometimes in contradiction with the president of Russia. And then he appealed

19:43.360 --> 19:49.840
 to the opposite people, the successful urban base through the so called reformer Medvedev,

19:49.840 --> 19:56.720
 the new generation, the technically literate prime minister who for a time was president.

19:56.720 --> 20:03.600
 And so that worked very successfully for Putin. He was able to bridge a big divide in the society

20:03.600 --> 20:10.480
 and gain a greater mass support than he would otherwise have had by himself. That ruse only

20:10.480 --> 20:19.280
 worked through the time that Medvedev was temporarily president for a few years because of

20:19.280 --> 20:26.080
 the constitution Putin couldn't do three consecutive terms and stepped aside in what they call

20:26.080 --> 20:35.920
 castling in chess. When this was over, Putin had difficulty with his popularity. There were mass

20:35.920 --> 20:43.120
 protests in the urban areas. Precisely that group of the population that he had been able to win in

20:43.120 --> 20:52.640
 part because of the Medvedev castling and now had had their delusions exposed and were disillusioned.

20:53.840 --> 20:58.160
 And there were these mass protests in the urban areas, not just in the capital, by the way,

20:58.800 --> 21:04.160
 and Putin had to, as it were, come up with a new way to fix his popularity, which happened to be

21:04.160 --> 21:13.920
 the annexation of Crimea, from which he got a very significant bump. However, the trend is back

21:13.920 --> 21:20.240
 in the other direction. It's diminishing again, although it's still high relative to other leaders

21:20.240 --> 21:28.720
 around the world. So I wouldn't say that he's unpopular with mass in Russia. There is some

21:28.720 --> 21:34.320
 popularity there. There is some success. But I would say it's tough for us to gauge because of

21:34.320 --> 21:40.320
 the lack of alternatives. And Putin is unpopular inside the state administration.

21:42.080 --> 21:47.920
 At every level, the bureaucracy of leadership. Because those people are well informed and they

21:47.920 --> 21:53.920
 understand that the country is declining, that the human capital is declining, the infrastructure

21:53.920 --> 21:59.680
 is declining, the economy is not really growing. It's not really diversifying. Russia is not

21:59.680 --> 22:05.280
 investing in its future. The state officials understand all of that. And then they see that

22:05.280 --> 22:13.040
 the Putin clique is stealing everything in sight. So between the failure to invest in a future

22:14.000 --> 22:19.680
 and the corruption of a narrow group around the president, there's disillusionment in the state

22:19.680 --> 22:26.160
 apparatus because they see this more clearly or more closely than the mass of the population.

22:27.280 --> 22:37.840
 They can't necessarily yet oppose this in public because there are people, they have families,

22:37.840 --> 22:43.520
 they have careers, they have children who want to go to school or want a job. And so there are

22:43.520 --> 22:50.720
 constraints on their ability to oppose the regime based upon what we might call cowardice or other

22:50.720 --> 22:57.840
 people might call realism. I don't know how courageous people can be when their family,

22:57.840 --> 23:05.200
 children, career are on the line. So it's very interesting dynamic to see the disillusionment

23:05.200 --> 23:11.280
 inside the government with the president, which is not yet fully public for the most part,

23:11.280 --> 23:16.640
 but could become public. And once again, if there's an alternative, if an alternative appears,

23:16.640 --> 23:21.040
 things could shift quickly. And that alternative could come from inside the regime.

23:21.920 --> 23:28.960
 From inside the regime. But the leadership, the party, the people that are now, as you're saying,

23:28.960 --> 23:35.360
 opposed to Putin, nevertheless, maybe you can correct me, but it feels like there's

23:35.360 --> 23:42.080
 just structurally is deeply corrupt. So each of each of the people we're talking about are

23:43.840 --> 23:50.000
 don't feel like a George Washington. Once again, the circumstances don't permit them

23:50.000 --> 23:56.480
 to act that way necessarily, right? George Washington did great things, but in certain

23:56.480 --> 24:03.440
 circumstances, a lot of the state officials in Russia, for certain, are corrupt. There's no

24:03.440 --> 24:12.160
 question. Many of them, however, are patriotic. And many of them feel badly about where the

24:12.160 --> 24:17.760
 country has been going. They would prefer that the country was less corrupt. They would prefer

24:17.760 --> 24:24.800
 that there were greater investment in all sorts of areas of Russia. They might even,

24:24.800 --> 24:31.120
 themselves, steal less if they could be guaranteed that everybody else would steal less.

24:31.120 --> 24:39.280
 There's a deep and abiding patriotism inside Russia, as well as inside the Russian regime.

24:40.400 --> 24:46.080
 So they understand that Putin, in many ways, rescued the Russian state from the chaos of the

24:46.080 --> 24:54.880
 1990s. They understand that Russia was in very bad shape as an incoherent failing state almost

24:54.880 --> 25:03.120
 when Putin took over, and that he did some important things for Russia's stability and

25:03.120 --> 25:12.720
 consolidation. There's also some appreciation that Putin stood up to the West and stood up to

25:12.720 --> 25:19.440
 more powerful countries and regained a sense of pride and maneuverability for Russia and the

25:19.440 --> 25:26.160
 international system. People appreciate that, and it's real. It's not imagined that Putin accomplished

25:26.160 --> 25:33.840
 that. The problem is the methods that he accomplished it with. He used the kind of methods,

25:33.840 --> 25:40.000
 that is to say, taking other people's property, putting other people in jail for political reasons.

25:40.560 --> 25:45.280
 He used the kind of methods that are not conducive to long term growth and stability.

25:45.280 --> 25:51.840
 So he fixed the problem, but he fixed the problem and then created even bigger long term problems

25:51.840 --> 26:00.320
 potentially. Moreover, all authoritarian regimes that use those methods are tempted to keep using

26:00.320 --> 26:06.400
 them and using them and using them until they're the only ones who are the beneficiaries. The group

26:06.400 --> 26:14.000
 narrows and narrows. The elite gets smaller and narrower. The interest groups get excluded from

26:14.000 --> 26:22.320
 power and their ability to continue enjoying the fruits of the system, and the resentment grows.

26:22.320 --> 26:29.040
 And so that's the situation we have. And Russia is a place that is stuck. It was, to a certain

26:29.040 --> 26:36.800
 extent, rescued. It was rescued with methods that were not conducive to long term success and

26:36.800 --> 26:43.440
 stability. The rescue we're referring to is the economic growth when Putin first took office.

26:43.440 --> 26:48.080
 They had 10 years. They had a full decade of an average of 7% growth a year,

26:48.960 --> 26:55.680
 which was phenomenal and is not attributable predominantly to oil prices. During President

26:55.680 --> 27:03.920
 Putin's first term as president, the average price of oil was $35 a barrel. During his second term

27:03.920 --> 27:12.320
 as president, the average price was $70 a barrel. So during those two terms, when Russia was growing

27:12.320 --> 27:20.720
 at about 7% a year, oil prices were averaging somewhere around $50 a barrel, which is fine,

27:21.280 --> 27:30.000
 but is not the reason because later on, when oil prices were over $100 a barrel, Russia stagnated.

27:30.640 --> 27:34.160
 So the initial growth, do you think Putin deserves some credit for that?

27:34.160 --> 27:41.200
 Yes, he does because he introduced some important liberalizing measures. He lowered taxes.

27:41.200 --> 27:49.200
 He allowed land to be bought and sold. He deregulated many areas of the economy.

27:50.080 --> 27:57.600
 And so there was a kind of entrepreneurial burst that was partly attributable, partly

27:57.600 --> 28:03.920
 attributable to government policy during his first term. But also he was consolidating political

28:03.920 --> 28:12.480
 power. And as I said, the methods he used overall for the long term, we're not able to continue

28:12.480 --> 28:18.960
 sustain that success. In addition, we have to remember that China played a really big role

28:20.080 --> 28:24.880
 in the success of Russia in the first two terms of Putin's presidency,

28:24.880 --> 28:34.080
 because China's phenomenal growth created insatiable demand for just about everything

28:34.080 --> 28:40.560
 that the Soviet Union used to produce. So fertilizers, cement, fill in the blank,

28:41.520 --> 28:49.360
 chemicals, metals. China had insatiable demand for everything the Soviet Union once produced.

28:49.360 --> 29:00.640
 And so China's raising of global demand overall brought Soviet era industry back from the dead.

29:01.920 --> 29:07.840
 And so there was something that happened. Soviet era industry fell off a cliff in the 1990s.

29:08.720 --> 29:14.720
 There was a decline in manufacturing and industrial production greater than in the Great Depression

29:14.720 --> 29:22.720
 in the US. But a lot of that came back online in the 2000s. And that had to do with China's

29:22.720 --> 29:28.960
 phenomenal growth. The trade between China and Russia was not always direct. So this was an

29:28.960 --> 29:36.880
 indirect effect. But raising global prices for the commodities and the products, the kind of

29:36.880 --> 29:45.040
 lower and lower value products in manufacturing, not high end stuff, but lower end stuff like steel

29:45.040 --> 29:53.520
 or iron or cement or fertilizer, where the value added is not spectacular, but nonetheless,

29:53.520 --> 30:00.400
 which had been destroyed by the 1990s and after the Soviet collapse. This was brought back to life.

30:00.400 --> 30:05.680
 Now you can do that once. You can bring Soviet era industry back to life once.

30:05.680 --> 30:11.440
 And that happened during Putin's first two terms in addition to the liberalizing policies,

30:12.320 --> 30:19.840
 which spurred entrepreneurialism in some small and medium business. The crash of the ruble in 1998,

30:20.400 --> 30:26.000
 which made Russian products much cheaper abroad and made imports much more expensive,

30:26.960 --> 30:34.480
 also facilitated the resuscitation, the revival of domestic manufacturing. So all of this came

30:34.480 --> 30:44.720
 together for that spectacular 10 year, 7% on average economic growth. And moreover, people's

30:44.720 --> 30:53.520
 wages after inflation, their disposable income grew more even than GDP grew. So disposable

30:53.520 --> 31:00.080
 income after inflation, that is a real income, was growing greater than 7%. In some cases,

31:00.080 --> 31:06.240
 10% a year. So there was a boom and the Russian people felt it and it happened during Putin's

31:06.240 --> 31:14.640
 first two terms and people were grateful, rightly so for that. And those who don't want to give Putin

31:14.640 --> 31:23.360
 credit, give oil prices all the credit. But I don't think that oil prices can explain this.

31:23.360 --> 31:28.000
 Having said that, that doesn't mean that this was sustainable over the long term.

31:28.000 --> 31:36.480
 Right. So you've briefly mentioned sort of implying the possibility Stalin held power for,

31:36.480 --> 31:43.760
 let's say, 30 years. You've briefly mentioned that as a question, will Putin be able to beat

31:43.760 --> 31:50.720
 that record, to beat that? So can you talk about your sense of, is it possible that Putin holds

31:50.720 --> 32:00.240
 power for that kind of duration? Let's hope not. Let's hope not for Russia's sake. The primary

32:00.240 --> 32:08.000
 victims of President Putin's power are Russians. They're not Ukrainians, although to a certain

32:08.000 --> 32:14.960
 extent Ukraine has suffered because of Putin's actions. And they're not Americans. They're Russians.

32:14.960 --> 32:21.600
 Moreover, Russia has lost a great deal of human talent. Millions and millions of people have left

32:21.600 --> 32:29.840
 Russia since 1991 overall, somewhere between five and 10 million people have left the country

32:30.880 --> 32:37.200
 and are beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union. So they left the Soviet space entirely.

32:37.760 --> 32:42.560
 Moreover, the people who left are not the poor people. They're not the uneducated.

32:42.560 --> 32:48.640
 They're not the losers. The people who've left are the more dynamic parts of the population,

32:48.640 --> 32:55.360
 the better educated, the more entrepreneurial. So that human capital loss that Russia has suffered

32:55.360 --> 33:02.960
 is phenomenal. And in fact, right here where we're sitting at MIT, we have examples of people who

33:02.960 --> 33:08.800
 are qualified, good enough for MIT, and have left Russia to come to MIT.

33:08.800 --> 33:14.240
 You're looking at one of them. And the other aspect, just to quickly comment,

33:14.240 --> 33:19.200
 is those same people like me. I'm not welcome back.

33:19.200 --> 33:25.200
 No, you're not under the current regime. It was a big loss for Russia if you're patriotic,

33:25.200 --> 33:31.600
 but not from the point of view of the Putin regime. That has to do also factors into popularity.

33:31.600 --> 33:38.320
 If the people who don't like you leave, they're not there to complain, to protest, to vote against

33:38.320 --> 33:46.480
 you. And so your opposition declines when you let them leave. However, it's very costly in human

33:46.480 --> 33:53.840
 capital terms. Hemorrhaging that much human capital is damaging, it's self damaging. And we've seen

33:53.840 --> 33:59.840
 it accelerate. It was already high, but we've seen it accelerate in the last

33:59.840 --> 34:09.520
 in the last seven to eight years of President Putin's rule. And those people are not going

34:09.520 --> 34:14.480
 back of their own volition, but even if they wanted to go back, as you just said, they'd be

34:14.480 --> 34:21.520
 unwelcome. That's a big cost to pay for this regime. And so whatever benefits this regime might or

34:21.520 --> 34:28.880
 might not have given to the country, the disadvantages, the downside, the costs are also

34:28.880 --> 34:35.280
 really high. So we don't want Putin lasting in power as long as Stalin. It would be better

34:35.840 --> 34:41.600
 if Russia were able to choose among options, to choose a new leader among options.

34:42.640 --> 34:49.040
 Many people speculate that President Putin will name a successor the way Yeltsin named Putin as

34:49.040 --> 34:56.000
 his successor, Boris, President Boris Yeltsin. And then Putin will leave the stage and allow

34:56.000 --> 35:03.760
 the successor to take over. That might seem like a good solution. But once again, we don't need a

35:03.760 --> 35:09.680
 system where you hang on for as long as possible than to nominate who's going to take over. We

35:09.680 --> 35:17.760
 need a system that has the kind of corrective mechanisms that democracies and markets have,

35:17.760 --> 35:24.320
 along with rule of law. A corrective mechanism is really important because all leaders make mistakes.

35:24.320 --> 35:32.400
 But when you can't correct for the mistakes, then the mistakes get compounded. Putin could

35:32.400 --> 35:39.440
 well he seems to be healthy. He could well last as many years as Stalin. It's hard to predict because

35:39.440 --> 35:47.280
 events intercede sometimes and create circumstances that are unforeseen and leaders get overthrown

35:47.280 --> 35:54.880
 or have a heart attack or whatever. There's a palace insurrection where ambitious leaders on

35:54.880 --> 36:02.560
 the inside, for both personal power and patriotic reasons, try to push aside an aging leader.

36:03.200 --> 36:09.520
 There are many scenarios in which Putin could not last that long. But unfortunately, right now,

36:10.480 --> 36:16.400
 you could also imagine potentially him lasting that long, which as I said, is not an outcome

36:16.400 --> 36:21.840
 if you're patriotic about Russia. It's not an outcome you would wish out to the country.

36:21.840 --> 36:30.240
 I guess a very difficult question. But what practically do you feel is a way out of the Putin

36:30.240 --> 36:39.920
 regime? Is the way out of the corruption that's deeply underlies the state? If you look from a

36:39.920 --> 36:51.360
 history perspective, is a revolution required? Is violence required? Is from violence within

36:51.360 --> 37:04.560
 or external to the country? Is a powerful, inspiring leader enough to step in and bring

37:04.560 --> 37:11.280
 democracy and the free world to Russia? Russia is not a failed country. It's a

37:11.280 --> 37:19.040
 middle income country with tremendous potential and has proven many times in the past that when

37:19.040 --> 37:27.840
 it gets in a bad way, it can reverse its trajectory. Moreover, violence is rarely ever a solution.

37:27.840 --> 37:35.040
 Violence rarely, it may break an existing trend, but it's rare that violence produces a nonviolent

37:35.040 --> 37:42.400
 sustainable positive outcome. It happens, but it doesn't happen frequently. Societal upheaval

37:44.320 --> 37:52.320
 is not a way always to institutionalize a better path forward because you need institutions. People

37:52.320 --> 37:58.560
 can protest as they did throughout the Middle East and the protests didn't necessarily lead

37:58.560 --> 38:07.360
 to better systems because the step from protest to new, strong, consolidated institutions is a

38:07.360 --> 38:14.240
 colossal leap, not a small step. What we need and what we see from history and situations like this

38:14.240 --> 38:22.560
 is a group within the power structures, which is a patriotic, that sees things going down,

38:22.560 --> 38:30.640
 that is to say, that sees things not developing relative to neighbors, relative to richer countries,

38:30.640 --> 38:37.600
 relative to more successful countries. They want to change the trajectory of Russia.

38:37.600 --> 38:47.920
 And if they can, in a coalition fashion, unseat the current regime for a new power sharing arrangement,

38:48.720 --> 38:53.680
 which once again can be frustrating because you can't do changes immediately,

38:53.680 --> 38:59.840
 you can't do things overnight, but that's the point. Constraints on your ability to change

38:59.840 --> 39:05.440
 everything immediately and to force change overnight is what leads to long term success.

39:05.440 --> 39:16.320
 That's the sustainability of change. So Russia needs stronger institutions. It needs court system

39:17.600 --> 39:24.400
 as well as democratic institutions. It needs functioning open dynamic markets rather than

39:24.400 --> 39:33.120
 monopolies. It needs meritocracy and banks to award loans on the basis of business plans,

39:33.120 --> 39:38.720
 not on the basis of political criteria or corrupt bribery or whatever it might be.

39:39.760 --> 39:47.600
 So Russia needs those kind of functioning institutions that take time, are sometimes slow,

39:48.320 --> 39:55.920
 don't lead to revolutionary transformation, but lead to potentially long term sustainable growth

39:55.920 --> 40:02.320
 without upheaval, without violence, without getting into a situation where all of a sudden

40:02.320 --> 40:09.600
 you need a miracle again. Every time Russia seems to need a miracle, and that's the problem,

40:10.480 --> 40:17.040
 the solution would be not needing a miracle. Now, having said that, the potential is there.

40:17.760 --> 40:25.120
 The civilization that we call Russia is amazingly impressive. It has delivered world class culture,

40:25.120 --> 40:32.960
 world class science. It's a great power. It's not a great power with a strong base right now,

40:32.960 --> 40:38.400
 but nonetheless, it is a great power as it acts in the world. So I wouldn't underestimate Russia's

40:38.400 --> 40:44.560
 abilities here, and I wouldn't write off Russia. I don't see it under the current regime, a renewal

40:44.560 --> 40:52.080
 of the country. But if we can have from within the regime an evolution rather than a revolution

40:52.080 --> 41:00.880
 in a positive direction, and maybe get a George Washington figure who is strong enough to push

41:00.880 --> 41:08.880
 through institutionalization rather than personalism. So if I could ask about one particular individual,

41:10.080 --> 41:14.560
 it'd be just interesting to get your comment, but also as a representative of potential leaders.

41:14.560 --> 41:20.560
 I just on this podcast talked to Gary Kasparov, who I'm not sure if you're familiar with his

41:20.560 --> 41:28.400
 ongoings. So besides being a world class chess player, he's also a very outspoken activist,

41:28.400 --> 41:36.640
 sort of seeing Putin, truly seeing Putin as an enemy of the free world of democracy, of

41:37.840 --> 41:44.400
 balanced government in Russia. What do you think of people like him specifically, or just people

41:44.400 --> 41:53.600
 like him trying as leaders to step in to run for president to symbolize a new chapter in Russia's

41:53.600 --> 42:01.680
 future? So we don't need individuals. Some individuals are very impressive, and they have

42:01.680 --> 42:09.200
 courage, and they protest, and they criticize, and they organize. We need institutions. We need a

42:09.200 --> 42:16.000
 duma or a parliament that functions. We need a court system that functions. That is to say where

42:16.000 --> 42:25.520
 there are a separation of powers, impartial professional civil service, impartial professional

42:26.320 --> 42:32.720
 judiciary. Those are the things Russia needs. It's rare that you get that from an individual,

42:32.720 --> 42:39.440
 no matter how impressive. We had Andrei Sakharov, who was an extraordinary individual,

42:40.560 --> 42:47.920
 who developed the hydrogen bomb under Soviet regime, was a world class physicist,

42:48.960 --> 42:56.400
 was then upset about how his scientific knowledge and scientific achievements were being put to use

42:56.400 --> 43:04.560
 and rebelled to try to put limits, constraints, civilizing humane limits

43:04.560 --> 43:11.760
 and constraints on some of the implications of his extraordinary science. But Sakharov,

43:11.760 --> 43:18.080
 even if he had become the leader of the country, which he did not become, he was more of a moral

43:18.080 --> 43:23.280
 or spiritual leader, it still wouldn't have given you a judiciary. It still wouldn't have

43:23.280 --> 43:28.160
 given you a civil service. It still wouldn't have given you a duma or functioning parliament.

43:28.880 --> 43:34.240
 You need a leader in coalition with other leaders. You need a bunch of leaders,

43:35.760 --> 43:41.120
 a whole group, and they have to be divided a little bit so that not one of them can destroy

43:41.120 --> 43:50.000
 all the others. And they have to be interested in creating institutions, not solely or predominantly

43:50.000 --> 43:57.360
 in their personal power. And so I have no objection to outstanding individuals and to the work that

43:57.360 --> 44:04.000
 they do. But I think in institutional terms, and they need to think that way too in order to be

44:04.000 --> 44:10.640
 successful. So if we go back to the echoes of that after the Russian Revolution with Stalin,

44:10.640 --> 44:17.040
 with Lenin and Stalin, maybe you can correct me, but there was a group of people there

44:17.040 --> 44:28.480
 in that same kind of way, looking to establish institutions that were built in a beautifully

44:28.480 --> 44:37.440
 built around an ideology that they believed is good for the world. So sort of echoing that idea

44:37.440 --> 44:44.160
 of what we're talking about, what Russia needs now, can you, first of all, you've described a

44:44.160 --> 44:51.520
 fascinating thought which is Stalin is having amassed arguably more power than any man in history.

44:52.560 --> 44:58.080
 It's an interesting thing to think about. But can you tell about his journey to getting that power

44:58.080 --> 45:05.520
 after the Russian Revolution? How does that perhaps echo to our current discussion about

45:05.520 --> 45:13.360
 institutions and so on? And just in general, the story I think is fascinating of how one man is

45:13.360 --> 45:21.120
 able to get more power than any other man in history. It is a great story, not necessarily

45:21.120 --> 45:26.640
 from a moral point of view. But if you're interested in power, for sure, it's an incredible story.

45:28.160 --> 45:32.480
 So we have to remember that Stalin is also a product of circumstances,

45:33.360 --> 45:40.480
 not solely his own individual drive, which is very strong. But for example, World War One

45:40.480 --> 45:49.280
 breaks the Tsarist regime, the Tsarist order, imperial Russian state. Stalin has no participation

45:49.280 --> 45:57.040
 whatsoever in World War One. He spends World War One in exile in Siberia. Until the downfall

45:57.760 --> 46:08.240
 of the Tsarist autocracy in February 1917, Stalin is in Eastern Siberian exile. He's only able to

46:08.240 --> 46:16.560
 leave Eastern Siberia when that regime falls. He never fights in the war. He's called up briefly

46:16.560 --> 46:23.360
 towards the end of the war and is disqualified on physical grounds because of physical deformities

46:23.360 --> 46:30.640
 from being drafted. The war continues after the Tsarist regime has been toppled

46:30.640 --> 46:39.280
 in the capital and there's been a revolution. The war continues and that war is very radicalizing.

46:40.480 --> 46:47.360
 The peasants begin to seize the land after the Tsar falls, essentially destroying much of the

46:47.360 --> 46:52.080
 gentry class. Stalin has nothing to do with that. The peasants have their own revolution,

46:52.080 --> 47:00.320
 seizing the land, not in law, but in fact, de facto, not de jure land ownership. So there are

47:00.320 --> 47:09.360
 these really large processes underway that Stalin is alive during, but not a driver of.

47:10.720 --> 47:17.440
 The most improbable thing happens, which is a very small group of people around the figure of

47:17.440 --> 47:26.560
 Vladimir Lenin announces that it has seized power. Now, by this time in October 1917,

47:27.680 --> 47:32.080
 the government that has replaced the Tsar, the so called provisional government,

47:32.080 --> 47:38.320
 has failed. And so there's not so much power to seize from the provisional government.

47:38.320 --> 47:48.400
 What Lenin does is he does a coup on the left. That is to say, Soviets or councils as we would

47:48.400 --> 47:54.400
 call them in English, which represent people's power or the masses participating in politics,

47:54.400 --> 48:00.800
 a kind of radical grassroots democracy, are extremely popular all over the country and

48:00.800 --> 48:09.680
 not dominated by any one group, but predominantly socialist or predominantly leftist. Russia has

48:09.680 --> 48:16.560
 an election during the war, a free and fair election for the most part, despite the war

48:17.360 --> 48:25.440
 at the end of 1917 in December 1917. And three quarters plus of the country votes socialist

48:25.440 --> 48:32.160
 in some form or another. So the battle was over the definition of socialism and who had the right

48:32.800 --> 48:38.480
 to participate in defining socialism, not only what it would be, but who had the right to decide.

48:39.200 --> 48:45.680
 So there's a coup by Lenin's group known as the Bolsheviks against all the other socialists.

48:47.120 --> 48:52.800
 And so Lenin declares a seizure of power whereby the old government has failed,

48:52.800 --> 49:00.080
 people's power, the councils, known as the Soviets, are going to take their place. And Lenin seizes

49:00.080 --> 49:06.560
 power in the name of the Soviets. So it's a coup against the left, against the rest of the left,

49:07.120 --> 49:11.440
 not against the provisional government that has replaced the czar, which has already failed.

49:12.320 --> 49:21.520
 And so Stalin is able to come to power along with Lenin in this crazy seizure of power on the

49:21.520 --> 49:28.000
 left against the rest of the left in October 1917, which we know is the October Revolution.

49:28.000 --> 49:36.000
 And I call the October coup as many other historians call. The October Revolution happened

49:36.000 --> 49:42.000
 after the seizure of power. What's interesting about this episode is that the leftists who seize

49:42.000 --> 49:47.440
 power in the name of the Soviets, in the name of the masses, in the name of people's power,

49:47.440 --> 49:54.880
 they retain their hold. Many times in history, there's a seizure of power by the left,

49:54.880 --> 50:01.600
 and they fail. They collapse. They're cleaned out by an army or what we call forces of order

50:02.320 --> 50:10.240
 by counterrevolutionary forces. Lenin's revolution, Lenin's coup, is successful. It is able to hold

50:10.240 --> 50:18.080
 power and not just seize power. They win a civil war and they're entrenched in the heart of the

50:18.080 --> 50:27.520
 country already by 1921. Stalin is part of that group. Lenin needs somebody to run this new regime

50:27.520 --> 50:33.520
 in the kind of nitty gritty way. Lenin is the leader, the undisputed leader in the Bolshevik

50:33.520 --> 50:42.160
 Party, which changes their name to communists in 1918. He makes Stalin the general secretary

50:42.720 --> 50:49.040
 of the Communist Party. He creates a new position, which hadn't existed before,

50:49.680 --> 50:56.880
 a kind of day to day political manager, a right hand man. Not because Lenin is looking to replace

50:56.880 --> 51:03.040
 himself. He's looking to institutionalize a helpmate, a right hand man. He does this in

51:03.040 --> 51:11.600
 the spring of 1922. Stalin is named to this position, which Lenin has created expressly for

51:11.600 --> 51:18.880
 Stalin. So there's been a coup on the left, whereby the Bolsheviks, who become communists,

51:18.880 --> 51:24.320
 have seized power against the rest of the socialists and anarchists and the entire left.

51:25.280 --> 51:30.160
 And then there's an institutionalization of a position known as general secretary of the

51:30.160 --> 51:36.640
 Communist Party, right hand man of Lenin. Less than six weeks after Lenin has created

51:36.640 --> 51:47.280
 this position and installed Stalin, Lenin has a stroke, a major stroke, and never really returns

51:47.280 --> 51:55.920
 as a full actor to power before he dies of a fourth stroke in January 1924. So a position is

51:55.920 --> 52:03.840
 created for Stalin to run things on Lenin's behalf, and then Lenin has a stroke. And so Stalin now

52:03.840 --> 52:10.960
 has this new position, general secretary, but he's the right hand of a person who's no longer

52:10.960 --> 52:17.840
 exercising day to day control over affairs. Stalin then uses this new position to create

52:17.840 --> 52:24.480
 a personal dictatorship inside the Bolshevik dictatorship, which is the remarkable story

52:24.480 --> 52:31.840
 I tried to tell. So is there anything nefarious about any of what you just described? So it seems

52:31.840 --> 52:39.360
 conveniently that the position is created just for Stalin. There was a few other brilliant people,

52:39.360 --> 52:44.240
 arguably more brilliant than Stalin in the vicinity of Lenin. Why was Stalin chosen?

52:45.520 --> 52:54.080
 Why did Lenin all of a sudden fall ill? It's perhaps a conspiratorial question, but is there

52:54.080 --> 53:01.200
 anything nefarious about any of this historical trajectory to power that Stalin took in creating

53:01.200 --> 53:08.480
 the personal dictatorship? So history is full of contingency and surprise. After something happens,

53:09.520 --> 53:15.120
 we all think it's inevitable. It had to happen that way. Everything was leading up to it.

53:15.120 --> 53:25.440
 So Hitler seizes power in Germany in 1933, and the Nazi regime gets institutionalized by several

53:25.440 --> 53:31.760
 of his moves after being named chancellor. And so all German history becomes a story

53:31.760 --> 53:39.280
 of the Nazi rise to power, Hitler's rise to power. Every trend, tendency is bent into that

53:39.280 --> 53:46.560
 outcome. Things which don't seem related to that outcome all of a sudden get bent in that direction.

53:46.560 --> 53:52.560
 And other trends that were going on are no longer examined because they didn't lead to that outcome.

53:53.200 --> 53:59.600
 But Hitler's becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933 was not inevitable. It was contingent.

54:00.240 --> 54:05.760
 He was offered the position by the traditional conservatives. He's part of the radical right

54:05.760 --> 54:12.640
 and the traditional right named him chancellor. The Nazi party never outright won an election

54:13.280 --> 54:19.280
 that was free and fair before Hitler came to power. And in fact, its votes on the eve of

54:19.280 --> 54:25.600
 Hitler becoming chancellor declined relative to the previous election. So there's contingency in

54:25.600 --> 54:36.320
 history. And so Lenin's illness, his stroke, the neurological and blood problems that he had

54:37.120 --> 54:44.480
 were not a structure in history. In other words, if Lenin had been a healthier figure, Stalin might

54:44.480 --> 54:50.720
 never have become the Stalin that we know. That's not to say that all history is accidental,

54:50.720 --> 54:56.960
 just that we need to relate the structural, the larger structural factors to the contingent factors.

54:57.600 --> 55:03.920
 Why did Lenin pick Stalin? Well, Stalin was a very effective organizer and the position was

55:03.920 --> 55:09.760
 an organizational position. Stalin could get things done. He would carry out assignments,

55:09.760 --> 55:14.880
 no matter how difficult. He wouldn't complain that it was hard work or too much work.

55:14.880 --> 55:23.360
 He wouldn't go off womanizing and drinking and ignore his responsibilities. Lenin chose Stalin,

55:23.360 --> 55:28.320
 among other options, because he thought Stalin was the better option. Once again,

55:28.320 --> 55:32.640
 he wasn't choosing his successor because he didn't know he was going to have this stroke.

55:33.600 --> 55:39.280
 Lenin had some serious illnesses, but he had never had a major stroke before.

55:39.280 --> 55:46.800
 So, the choice was made based upon Stalin's organizational skills and promise

55:49.120 --> 55:55.520
 against the others who were in the regime. Now, they can seem more brilliant than Stalin,

55:55.520 --> 55:58.880
 but he was more effective and I'm not sure they were very brilliant.

55:59.600 --> 56:04.400
 Well, he was exceptionally competent actually at the tasks for running a government of the

56:04.400 --> 56:10.640
 executive branch of a dictator. Yes, he turned out to be very adept at being a dictator.

56:11.520 --> 56:18.480
 And so, if he had been chosen by Lenin and had not been very good, he would have been pushed

56:18.480 --> 56:26.480
 aside by others. You can get a position by accident. You can be named because you're

56:26.480 --> 56:33.440
 someone's friend or someone's relative, but to hold that position, to hold that position

56:33.440 --> 56:39.200
 in difficult circumstances, and then to build effectively a superpower on all that bloodshed.

56:40.400 --> 56:47.040
 You have to be skilled in some way. It can't be just the accident that brings you to power,

56:47.760 --> 56:54.400
 because if accident brings you to power, it won't last. Just like we discovered with Putin,

56:54.400 --> 57:01.120
 he had some qualities that we didn't foresee at the beginning, and he's been able to hold power,

57:01.120 --> 57:08.080
 not just be named. Now, Putin and Stalin are very different people. These are very different regimes.

57:08.080 --> 57:13.200
 I wouldn't put them in the same sentence. My point is not that one resembles the other.

57:14.320 --> 57:21.680
 My point is that when people come to power for contingent reasons, they don't stay in power

57:21.680 --> 57:27.840
 unless they're able to manage it. And Stalin was able to build a personal dictatorship inside

57:27.840 --> 57:35.040
 that dictatorship. He was cunning, he was ruthless, and he was a workaholic. He was very diligent.

57:35.040 --> 57:40.640
 He had a phenomenal memory, and so he could remember people's names and faces and events,

57:41.280 --> 57:48.480
 and this was very advantageous for him as he built the machine that became the Soviet state

57:48.480 --> 57:54.160
 and bureaucracy. One of the things, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but you've made me

57:54.160 --> 58:02.480
 realize this wasn't some kind of manipulative personality trying to gain more power solely,

58:02.480 --> 58:11.040
 like kind of an evil picture of a person, but he truly believed in communism. As far as I can

58:11.040 --> 58:14.720
 understand, again, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but he wanted to build a better world

58:14.720 --> 58:25.360
 by having infusioned communism into the country and perhaps into the whole world.

58:26.000 --> 58:34.240
 So maybe my question is, what role does communism as an idea, as an ideology,

58:34.240 --> 58:39.920
 play in all of this, in his rise to power, in the people of the time, in the Russian people,

58:39.920 --> 58:46.160
 actually just the whole 20th century? You're right. Stalin was a true believer,

58:46.160 --> 58:50.880
 and this is very important. He was also hungry for power and for personal power,

58:51.440 --> 58:58.560
 but just as you said, not for power's sake, not only for power. He was interested in

58:58.560 --> 59:05.840
 enacting communism in reality and also in building a powerful state. He was a status,

59:05.840 --> 59:12.880
 a traditional Russian status in the imperial sense, and this won him a lot of followers.

59:13.760 --> 59:19.760
 The fact that they knew he was a hardcore true believing communist won him a lot of followers

59:19.760 --> 59:27.040
 among the communists, and the fact that he was a hardcore defender of Russian state interests

59:27.040 --> 59:33.280
 now in the Soviet guys also won him a lot of followers. Sometimes those groups overlapped

59:33.280 --> 59:39.280
 the communists and the Russian patriots, and sometimes they were completely different groups,

59:39.280 --> 59:47.680
 but both of them shared an admiration for Stalin's dedication to those goals and his abilities

59:47.680 --> 59:54.800
 to enact them. And so it's very important to understand that however thirsty he was for power,

59:54.800 --> 1:00:04.560
 and he was very thirsty for power, that he was also driven by ideals. Now, I don't necessarily

1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:13.680
 think that everyone around Stalin shared those ideals. We have to be careful not to make everybody

1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:19.360
 into a communist true believer, not to make everybody into a great status Russian patriot,

1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:29.200
 but they were widespread and powerful attractions for a lot of people. And so Stalin's ability

1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:36.240
 to communicate to people those that he was dedicated to those pursuits and his ability

1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:43.440
 to drive towards them were part of his appeal. However, he also resorted to manipulation. He

1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:51.760
 also resorted to violence. He lied. He spoke out of all sides of his mouth. He slandered other people.

1:00:51.760 --> 1:01:00.960
 He sabotaged potential rivals. He used every underhanded method and then some in order to

1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:07.120
 build his personal dictatorship. Now, he justified this, as you said, by appeals to communism

1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:15.360
 and to Soviet power to himself and to others. And so he justified it in his own mind and to others,

1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:25.920
 but certainly any means were acceptable to him to achieve these ends. And he identified his

1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:32.960
 personal power with communism and with Russian glory in the world. So he felt that he was the only

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:40.400
 one who could be trusted, who could be relied upon to build these things. Now, we put ourselves back

1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:48.480
 in that time period. The Great Depression was a very difficult time for the capitalist system.

1:01:48.480 --> 1:01:57.680
 There was mass unemployment, a lot of hardship, fascism, Nazism, Japan, Imperial Japan.

1:01:57.680 --> 1:02:03.600
 There were a lot of associations that were negative with the kind of capitalist system

1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:14.640
 that was not 100%, not a monolith, but had a lot of authoritarian incarnations. There was imperialism,

1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:21.200
 colonies that even the democratic rule of law capital estates had non democratic,

1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:28.560
 non rule of law colonies under their rule. So the image and reality of capitalism during

1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:35.040
 that time period between World War One and World War Two was very different from how it would become

1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:42.400
 later. And so in that time period, in that interwar conjuncture after World War One before World

1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:52.160
 War Two, communism held some appeal inside the Soviet Union for sure, but even outside the Soviet

1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:57.760
 Union because the image and reality of capitalism disappointed many people. Now in the end,

1:02:57.760 --> 1:03:05.120
 communism was significantly worse. Many more victims and the system, of course, would eventually

1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:10.240
 implode. But nonetheless, there were real problems that communism tried to address.

1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:16.480
 Yes, it didn't solve those problems. It was not a solution, but it didn't come out of nowhere.

1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:25.440
 It came out of the context of that interwar period. And so Stalin's rule, some people saw it as

1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:33.280
 potentially a better option than imperialism, fascism and Great Depression. Having said that,

1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:39.280
 they were wrong. It turned out that Stalin wasn't a better alternative to markets and

1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:47.040
 private property and rule of law and democracy. However, that didn't become clearer to people

1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:54.640
 until after World War Two, after Nazism had been defeated, Imperial Japan had been defeated,

1:03:54.640 --> 1:04:00.160
 the fascist Italy had been defeated, and decolonization had happened around the world.

1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:06.720
 And there was a middle class economic boom in the period from the late 40s through the 70s

1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:13.680
 that created a kind of mass middle class in many societies. So capitalism rose from the ashes,

1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:23.440
 as it were. And this changed the game for Stalin and communism. Communism is about

1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:30.320
 an alternative to capitalism. And if that alternative is not superior, there's no reason

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:38.400
 for communism to exist. But if capitalism is in foul odor, if people have a bad opinion,

1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:45.040
 strong critique of capitalism, there can be appeal to alternatives. And that's kind of what happened

1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:52.240
 with Stalin's rule. But after World War Two, the context changed a lot. Capitalism was very

1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:58.640
 different, much more successful, nonviolent compared to what it was in the interwar period.

1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:06.880
 And the Soviet Union had a tough time competing against that new context. Now, today, we see

1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:15.120
 similarly that the image and reality of capitalism is on the question again, which leads some people

1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:22.240
 to find an answer in socialism as an alternative. So you just kind of painted a beautiful picture

1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:29.200
 of comparison. This is the way we think about ideologies is what's working better. Do you

1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:35.440
 separate in your mind the ideals of communism to the Stalinist implementation of communism?

1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:43.520
 And again, capitalism and American implementation of capitalism. And as we look at now the 21st

1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:53.920
 century, where yes, this idea of socialism being a potential political system that we would or

1:05:53.920 --> 1:06:00.000
 economic system would operate under in the United States, rising up again as an idea. So how do we

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:06.480
 think about that? Again, in the 21st century, about these ideas, fundamental deep ideas of

1:06:06.480 --> 1:06:13.840
 communism capitalism. Yeah. So in the Marxist schema, there was something called feudalism, which

1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:20.320
 was supposedly destroyed by the bourgeoisie who created capitalism. And then the working class

1:06:20.320 --> 1:06:26.880
 was supposed to destroy capitalism and create socialism. But socialism wasn't the end stage,

1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:32.800
 the end stage was going to be communism. So that's why the Communist Party in the Soviet Union

1:06:32.800 --> 1:06:40.560
 first built socialism, transcending capitalism. The next stage was socialism and the end game,

1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:46.480
 the final stage was communism. So their version of socialism was derived from Marx.

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:56.160
 And Marx argued that the problem was capitalism had been very beneficial for a while.

1:06:56.160 --> 1:07:03.040
 It had produced greater wealth and greater opportunity than feudalism had. But then it had

1:07:03.040 --> 1:07:08.880
 come to serve only the narrow interests of the so called bourgeoisie or the capitalists themselves.

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:17.280
 And so for humanity's sake, the universal class, the working class needed to overthrow capitalism

1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:24.640
 in order for greater productivity, greater wealth to be produced for all of humanity to flourish

1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:31.920
 and on a higher level. So you couldn't have socialism unless you destroyed capitalism.

1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:39.920
 So that meant no markets, no private property, no so called parliaments or bourgeois parliaments,

1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:48.320
 as they were called. So you got socialism in Marx's schema by transcending by eliminating capitalism.

1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:58.240
 Now, Marx also called for freedom. He said that this elimination of markets and private

1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:03.600
 property and bourgeois parliaments would produce greater freedom in addition to greater abundance.

1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:14.480
 However, everywhere this was tried, it produced tyranny and mass violence, death and shortages.

1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:20.880
 Everywhere it was tried. There's no exception in historical terms. And so it's very interesting.

1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:27.920
 Marx insisted that capitalism had to be eliminated. You couldn't have markets.

1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:36.000
 Markets were chaos. You needed planning. You couldn't have hiring of wage labor. That was

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:40.800
 wage slavery. You couldn't have private property because that was a form of theft.

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:47.520
 So in the Marxist scheme, somehow you were going to eliminate capitalism

1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:53.600
 and get to freedom. It turned out you didn't get to freedom. So then people said, well,

1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:59.520
 you can't blame Marx because he said we needed freedom. He was pro freedom.

1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:06.320
 So it's kind of like dropping a nuclear bomb. You say you're going to drop a nuclear bomb,

1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:15.680
 but you want to minimize civilian casualties. So the dropping of the nuclear bomb is the

1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:22.640
 elimination of markets, private property and parliaments. But you're going to bring freedom

1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:27.440
 or you're going to minimize civilian casualties. So you drop the nuclear bomb,

1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:37.120
 you eliminate the capitalism and you get famine, deportation, no constraints on executive power,

1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:43.760
 and not abundance, but shortages. And people say, well, that's not what Marx said. That's not what

1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:49.920
 I said. I said I wanted to minimize civilian casualties. The nuclear bomb goes off and there's

1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:57.360
 mass civilian casualties. And you keep saying, but I said drop the bomb, but minimize civilian

1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:03.360
 casualties. So that's where we are. That's history, not philosophy. I'm speaking about

1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:10.480
 historical examples, all the cases that we have. Marx was not a theorist of inequality.

1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:22.320
 Marx was a theorist of alienation, of dehumanization, of fundamental constraints or what he called

1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:28.000
 fetters on productivity and on wealth, which he all attributed to capitalism.

1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:35.040
 Marx wasn't bothered by inequality. He was bothered by something deeper, something worse.

1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:44.320
 Those socialists who figured this out, who understood that if you drop the nuclear bomb,

1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:50.400
 there was no way to minimize civilian casualties. Those socialists who came to understand

1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:56.400
 that if you eliminated capitalism, markets, private property, and parliaments, if you

1:10:56.400 --> 1:11:04.160
 eliminated that, you wouldn't get freedom. Those Marxists, those socialists became what we would

1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:10.960
 call social democrats or people who would use the state to regulate the market,

1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:18.720
 not to eliminate the market. They would use the state to redistribute income, not to destroy

1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:25.680
 private property and markets. And so this in the Marxist schema was apostasy,

1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:32.400
 because they were accepting markets and private property. They were accepting alienation and wage

1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:38.800
 slavery. They were accepting capitalism in principle, but they wanted to fix it. They wanted

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:45.680
 to ameliorate. They wanted to regulate. And so they became what was denounced as revisionists,

1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:53.200
 not true Marxists, not real revolutionaries, but parliamentary road, parliamentarians.

1:11:54.240 --> 1:12:01.200
 We know this as normal politics, normal social democratic politics from the European case or

1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:08.800
 from the American case, but they are not asking to eliminate capitalism, blaming capitalism,

1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:16.560
 blaming markets and private property. So this rift among the socialists, the ones who are for

1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:25.680
 elimination of capitalism, transcending capitalism, otherwise you could never, ever get to abundance

1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:32.080
 and freedom in the Marxist schema versus those who accept capitalism, but want to regulate and

1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:39.920
 redistribute. That rift on the left has been with us almost from the beginning. It's a kind of civil

1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:47.200
 war on the left between the Leninists and the social democrats or the revisionists, as they're

1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:54.400
 known pejoratively by the Leninists. We have the same confusion today in the world today,

1:12:54.400 --> 1:13:04.640
 where people also cite Marx saying capitalism is a dead end, and we need to drop that nuclear bomb

1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:12.960
 and get freedom, get no civilian casualties, versus those who say, yes, there are inequities,

1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:20.560
 there's a lack of equality of opportunity. There are many other issues that we need to deal with,

1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:26.400
 and we can fix those issues, we can regulate, we can redistribute. I'm not advocating this as a

1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:32.000
 political position. I'm not taking a political position myself. I'm just saying that there's a

1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:38.800
 confusion on the left between those who accept capitalism and want to regulate it versus those

1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:43.680
 who think capitalism is inherently evil, and if we eliminate it, we'll get to a better world,

1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:49.600
 when in fact history shows that if you eliminate capitalism, you get to a worse world.

1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:53.360
 The problems might be real, but the solutions are worse.

1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:59.520
 From history's lessons, now we have deep, painful lessons, but there's not that many of them.

1:14:00.960 --> 1:14:07.920
 Our history is relatively short as a human species. Do we have a good answer on the left

1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:14.320
 of Leninists, Marxists, versus social democrat, versus capitalism, versus any

1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:23.280
 anarchy? Do we have sufficient samples from history to make better decisions about the

1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:28.240
 future of our politics and economics? For sure. We have the American Revolution,

1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:35.680
 which was a revolution not about class, not about workers, not about a so called universal

1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:40.080
 class of the working class, elimination of capitalism markets in the bourgeoisie,

1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:48.320
 but was about the category citizen. It was about universal humanity, where everyone in

1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:54.560
 theory could be part of it as a citizen. The revolution fell short of its own ideals,

1:14:55.200 --> 1:15:01.760
 not everyone was a citizen. For example, if you didn't own property, you were a male,

1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:06.960
 but didn't own property, you didn't have full rights of a citizen. If you were a female,

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:14.400
 whether you own property or not, you weren't a full citizen. If you were imported from Africa

1:15:14.400 --> 1:15:23.360
 against your will, you were a slave and not a citizen. And so not everyone was afforded the

1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:30.560
 rights in actuality that were declared in principle. However, over time, the category

1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:36.960
 citizen could expand and slaves could be emancipated and they could get the right to vote.

1:15:36.960 --> 1:15:43.600
 They could become citizens. Non property owning males could get the right to vote and become full

1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:51.200
 citizens. Females could get the right to vote and become full citizens. In fact, eventually my

1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:57.760
 mother was able to get a credit card in her own name in the 1970s without my father having to

1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:05.760
 cosine the paperwork. It took a long time, but nonetheless, the category citizen can expand

1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:14.320
 and it can become a universal category. So we have that, the citizen universal humanity model

1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:22.000
 of the American revolution, which was deeply flawed at the time it was introduced, but fixable

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:28.400
 over time. We also had that separation of powers and constraint on executive power that we began

1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:34.720
 this conversation with. That was also institutionalized in the American revolution because they were

1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:43.200
 afraid of tyranny. They were afraid of unconstrained executive power. So they built a system that would

1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:49.200
 contain that, constrain it institutionally, not circumstantially. So that's a great gift.

1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:57.520
 Within that universal category of citizen, which has, over time, come closer to fulfilling its

1:16:57.520 --> 1:17:03.920
 original promise, and within those institutional constraints, that separation of powers,

1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:10.160
 constraint on executive power, within that we've developed what we might call normal politics,

1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:18.960
 left, right politics. People can be in favor of redistribution and government action, and people

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:27.360
 can be in favor of small government, hands off government, no redistribution or less redistribution.

1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:33.920
 That's the normal left, right political spectrum where you respect the institutions and separation

1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:41.200
 of powers, and you respect the universal category of citizenship and equality before the law and

1:17:41.200 --> 1:17:49.920
 everything else. I don't see any problems with that whatsoever. I see that as a great gift,

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:55.600
 not just to this country, but around the world and other places besides the United States

1:17:55.600 --> 1:18:03.840
 have developed this. The problems arise at the extremes, the far left and the far right,

1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:11.120
 that don't recognize the legitimacy either of capitalism or of democratic rule of law

1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:17.360
 institutions, and they want to eliminate constraints on executive power. They want to control the

1:18:17.360 --> 1:18:24.080
 public sphere or diminish the independence of the media. They want to take away markets or

1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:29.440
 private property, and redistribution becomes something bigger than just redistribution. It

1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:38.160
 becomes actually that original Marxist idea of transcending capitalism. I'm not bothered by the

1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:44.800
 left or the right. I think they're normal, and we should have that debate. We're a gigantic,

1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:52.400
 diverse country of many different political points of view. I'm troubled only by the extremes

1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:59.280
 that are against the system, cross system, that want to get rid of it, and supposedly that will be

1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:05.440
 the right path to the future. History tells us that the far left and the far right are wrong

1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:12.640
 about that. But once again, this doesn't mean that you have to be a social democrat. You could be a

1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:20.000
 libertarian. You could be a conservative. You could be a centrist. You could be conservative on some

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:25.520
 issues and liberal on other issues. All of that comes under what I would presume to be normal

1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:32.640
 politics. And I see that as the important corrective mechanism, normal politics and market economies,

1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:41.040
 non monopolistic, open, free, and dynamic market economies. I don't like concentrations of power

1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:47.600
 politically, and I don't like concentrations of power economically. I like competition in the

1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:56.000
 political realm. I like competition in the economic realm. This is not perfect. It constantly

1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:05.200
 needs to be protected and reinvented. There are flaws that are fundamental and need to be adjusted

1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:11.920
 and addressed and everything else, especially equality of opportunity. Equality of outcome

1:20:11.920 --> 1:20:20.240
 is unreachable and is a mistake because it produces perverse and unintended consequences,

1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:26.480
 equality of outcome attempts, attempts to make people equal on the outcome side,

1:20:27.200 --> 1:20:33.440
 but attempts to make them more equal on the front end, on the opportunity side. That's really,

1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:40.320
 really important for a healthy society. That's where we've fallen down. Our schools are not

1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:48.320
 providing equality of opportunity for the majority of people in all of our school systems.

1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:57.360
 And so I see problems there. I see a need to invest in ourselves, invest in infrastructure,

1:20:57.360 --> 1:21:04.160
 invest in human capital, create greater equality of opportunity, but also to make sure that we

1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:10.000
 have good governance because governance is the variable that enables you to do all these other

1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:16.160
 things. I've watched quite a bit returning back to Putin. I've watched quite a few interviews

1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:23.120
 with Putin and conversations, especially because I speak Russian fluently. I can

1:21:23.120 --> 1:21:37.920
 understand often the translations lose a lot. I find the man putting morality aside very deep

1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:48.240
 and interesting. And I found almost no interview with him to get at that depth. I was very hopeful

1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:56.400
 for the Oliver Stone documentary with him and to me, because I deeply respect Oliver Stone

1:21:56.400 --> 1:22:01.120
 as a filmmaker in general, but it was a complete failure in my eyes, that interview.

1:22:05.680 --> 1:22:13.200
 I suppose you could toss it up to a language barrier, but a complete lack of diving deep

1:22:13.200 --> 1:22:19.680
 into the person as what I saw. My question is a strange one, but if you were to sit down with

1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:28.320
 Putin and have a conversation, or perhaps if you were to sit down with Stalin and have a

1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:35.520
 conversation, what kind of questions would you ask? This wouldn't be televised unless you wanted

1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:41.520
 to be. So this is only you. So you're allowed to ask about some of the questions that are

1:22:41.520 --> 1:22:50.000
 sort of not socially acceptable, meaning putting morality aside, getting it to depth of the human

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:55.520
 character. What would you ask? So once again, they're very different personalities and very

1:22:55.520 --> 1:23:01.360
 different time periods and very different regimes. So what I would talk to Stalin about and Putin

1:23:01.360 --> 1:23:12.640
 about are not in the same category necessarily. So let's take Putin. So I would ask him where he

1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:20.400
 thinks this is going, where he thinks Russia is going to be in 25 years or 50 years. What's the

1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:27.040
 long term vision? What does he anticipate the current trends are going to produce? Is he under

1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:35.600
 the illusion that Russia is on the upswing, that things are actually going pretty well,

1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:43.600
 that in 25 years Russia is going to still be a great power with a tremendous dynamic economy and

1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:49.760
 a lot of high tech and a lot of human capital and wonderful infrastructure and a very high

1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:56.800
 standard of living and a secure, secure borders and sense of security at home. Does he think the

1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:07.120
 current path is leading in that direction? And if not, if he understands that the current trajectory

1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:15.680
 does not provide for those kinds of circumstances, does it bother him? Does he worry about that?

1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:19.840
 Does he care about the future 25 or 50 years from now?

1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:28.480
 So either he thinks he's on that trajectory already or he doesn't care about that long term

1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:34.720
 trajectory. So that's the mystery for me with him. He's clever. He has tremendous sources of

1:24:34.720 --> 1:24:42.720
 information. He has great experience now as a world leader having served for effectively longer

1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:51.760
 than Leonid Brezhnev's long 18 year reign. And so Putin has accumulated a great deal of experience

1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:57.360
 at the highest level compared to where he started. And so I'm interested to understand

1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:06.800
 how he sees this long term evolution or non evolution of Russia and whether he believes

1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:12.400
 he's got them on the right trajectory or whether if he doesn't believe that he cares.

1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:17.280
 I have no idea because I've never spoken to him about this, but I would love to hear the answer.

1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:23.040
 Sometimes you have to ask questions not directly like that, but you have to come a little bit

1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:30.000
 sideways. You can elicit answers from people by making them feel comfortable in coming sideways

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:36.960
 with them. On just a quick question. So that's talking about Russia and Putin's role in Russia.

1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:42.800
 Do you think it's interesting to ask, and you could say the same for Stalin,

1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:50.320
 the more personal question of how do you feel yourself about this whole thing,

1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:56.800
 about your life, about your legacy, looking at the person that's one of the most

1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:03.840
 powerful and important people in the history of civilization, both Putin and Stalin, you could

1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:11.440
 argue? Yeah. Once you experience power at that level, it becomes something that's almost necessary

1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:19.680
 for you as a human being. It's a drug. It's an aphrodisiac. It's a feeling. You know, you go to the

1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:28.000
 gym to exercise and the endorphins, the chemicals get released. And even if you're tired or you're

1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:37.440
 sore, you get this massive chemical change, which has very dynamic effects on how you feel and the

1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:42.800
 kind of level of energy you have for the rest of the day. And if you do that for a long time,

1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:48.560
 and then you don't do it for a while, you're like a drug addict, not getting your fix.

1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:55.680
 You miss it. Your body misses that release of endorphins to a certain extent. That's how power

1:26:55.680 --> 1:27:02.240
 works for people like Putin. That's how power works for people who run universities or are

1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:10.560
 secretaries of state or run corporations fill in the blank. In whatever ways power is exercised,

1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:17.680
 it becomes almost a drug for people. It becomes something that's difficult for them to give up.

1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:24.400
 It becomes a part of who they are. It becomes necessary for their sense of self and well being.

1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:31.120
 The greatest people, the people I admire the most are the ones that can step away from power,

1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:40.240
 can give it up, can give up the drug, can be satisfied, can be stronger even by walking away

1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:46.720
 from continued power when they had the option to continue. So with a person like Putin,

1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:51.840
 once again, I don't know him personally, so I have no basis to judge this.

1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:59.680
 This is a general statement observable with many people and in historical terms. With a

1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:06.080
 person like Putin who's exercised this much power for this long, it's something that becomes a part

1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:12.800
 of who you are and you have a hard time imagining yourself without it. You begin to conflate your

1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:18.720
 personal power with the well being of the nation. You begin to think that the more power you have,

1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:28.080
 the better off the country is this conflation. You begin to be able to not imagine. You can no

1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:33.520
 longer imagine what it would be like just to be an ordinary citizen or an ordinary person running

1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:42.880
 a company even, something much smaller than a country. So I anticipate that, without knowing

1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:49.840
 for sure, that he would be in that category of person. But you'd want to explore that with

1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:57.680
 questions with him about, so what's his day look like from beginning to end? Just take me through

1:28:57.680 --> 1:29:03.200
 a typical day of yours. What do you do in a day? How does it start? What are the ups? What are the

1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:08.000
 downs? What are the parts of the day you look forward to the most? What are the parts of the

1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:14.800
 day you don't look forward to that much? What do you consider a good day? What do you consider a bad

1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:22.480
 day? How do you know that what you're doing is having the effects that you intend? How do you

1:29:22.480 --> 1:29:28.160
 follow up? How do you gather the information, the reaction? How do you get people to tell you to

1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:34.560
 your face things that they know are uncomfortable or that you might not want to hear? Those kind

1:29:34.560 --> 1:29:40.000
 of questions. And through that window, through that kind of question, you get a window into a man

1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:47.920
 with power. So let me ask about Stalin because you've done more research. Is it another amazing

1:29:47.920 --> 1:29:57.600
 interview you've had? The introduction was that you know more about Stalin than Stalin himself.

1:29:57.600 --> 1:30:03.280
 You've done incredible amount of research on Stalin. So if you could talk to him, get sort of direct

1:30:03.280 --> 1:30:10.480
 research. What questions did you ask of Stalin? I have so many questions. I don't even know where

1:30:10.480 --> 1:30:17.360
 I would begin. The thing about studying a person like Stalin, who's an immense creature, right?

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:24.640
 He's exercising the power of life and death over hundreds of millions of people. He's making decisions

1:30:24.640 --> 1:30:34.160
 about novels and films and turbines and submarines and packs with Hitler or deals with Churchill and

1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:42.560
 Roosevelt and occupation of Mongolia or occupation of North Korea. He's making phenomenally

1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:52.320
 consequential decisions over all spheres of life, all areas of endeavor and over much of the globe,

1:30:52.320 --> 1:31:02.720
 much of the land mass of the earth. And so what's that like? Does he sometimes reflect on the amount

1:31:02.720 --> 1:31:10.160
 of power and responsibility he has that he can exercise? Does he sometimes think about what it

1:31:10.160 --> 1:31:16.960
 means that a single person has that kind of power? And does it have an effect on his relations with

1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:23.760
 others, his sense of self, the kinds of things he values in life? Does he sometimes think it's

1:31:23.760 --> 1:31:29.920
 a mistake that he's accumulated this much power? Does he sometimes wish he had a simpler life?

1:31:30.640 --> 1:31:41.120
 Or is he once again so drunk, so enamored, so caught up with chemically and spiritually

1:31:41.120 --> 1:31:47.200
 with exercising this kind of power that he couldn't live without it? And then what were you thinking,

1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:53.840
 I would ask him, in certain decisions that he made? What were you thinking on certain dates and

1:31:53.840 --> 1:31:58.160
 certain circumstances where you made a decision and could have made a different decision?

1:31:58.880 --> 1:32:05.840
 Can you recall your thought processes? Can you bring the decision back? Was it seat of the pants?

1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:11.600
 Was it something you'd been planning? Did you just improvise or did you have a strategy?

1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:18.800
 What were you guided by? Whose examples did you look to when you picked up these books that you

1:32:18.800 --> 1:32:23.520
 read and you read the books and you made pencil marks in them? Is it because you absorbed the

1:32:23.520 --> 1:32:28.960
 lesson there? Or did it really not become a permanent lesson and it was just something that

1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:36.880
 you checked and it was like a reflex? So I have many specific questions about many specific events

1:32:36.880 --> 1:32:45.680
 and people and circumstances that I have tried to figure out with the surviving source materials

1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:53.040
 that we have in abundance, but I would still like to delve into his mindset and reconstruct his mind.

1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:59.040
 The closer you get to Stalin in some ways, the more elusive he can become.

1:33:00.640 --> 1:33:05.280
 And especially around World War II, you've already illuminated a lot of interesting

1:33:05.280 --> 1:33:11.040
 aspects about Stalin's role in the war, but it would be interesting to ask even more questions

1:33:11.040 --> 1:33:16.320
 about how seat of the pants or deliberate some of the decisions have been. If I could ask just

1:33:16.320 --> 1:33:24.320
 one quick question, one last quick question, and you're constrained in time in answering it,

1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:30.000
 do you think there will always be evil in the world? Do you think there will always be war?

1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:38.960
 Unfortunately, yes. There are conflicting interests, conflicting goals that people have.

1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:46.080
 Most of the time, those conflicts can be resolved peacefully. That's why we build strong institutions

1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:55.920
 to resolve different interests and conflicts peacefully. But the fact, the enduring fact

1:33:55.920 --> 1:34:05.680
 of conflicting interests and conflicting desires, that can never be changed. So the job that we have

1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:17.920
 for humanity's sake is to make those conflicting interests, those conflicting desires, to put

1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:25.760
 them in a context where they can be resolved peacefully and not in a zero sum fashion. So we

1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:34.320
 can't get there on the global scale. So there's always going to be the kind of conflict that

1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:43.840
 sometimes gets violent. What we don't want is a conflict among the strongest powers. Great power

1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:53.120
 conflict is unbelievably bad. There are no words to describe it. At least 55 million people died

1:34:53.120 --> 1:35:00.880
 in World War II. If we have a World War III, a war between the United States and China or whatever

1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:11.440
 it might be, who knows what the number could be? 155 million, 255 million, 555 million.

1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:18.400
 I don't even want to think about it. And so it's horrible when wars break out in the humanitarian

1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:25.200
 catastrophes. For example, Yemen and Syria and several other places I could name today.

1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:31.120
 It's just horrible what you see there. And the scale is colossal for those places,

1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:39.520
 but it's not planetary scale. And so avoiding planetary scale destruction is really important

1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:50.400
 for us. And so having those different interests be somehow managed in a way that no one sees

1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:57.280
 advantage in a violent resolution. And a part of that is remembering history. So they should read

1:35:57.280 --> 1:36:01.760
 your books. Stephen, thank you so much. It was a huge honor talking to you today. I really enjoyed

1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:40.320
 spoken shortly before the death of Lenin and at the beginning of Stalin's rise to power.

1:36:40.320 --> 1:37:01.360
 First in Russian. I consider it completely unimportant who in the party will vote or how.

1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:08.000
 But what is extraordinarily important is who will count the votes and how.

1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:12.640
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
