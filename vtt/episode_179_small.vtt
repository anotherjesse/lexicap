00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 The following is a conversation with George St. Pierre,

00:03.000 --> 00:05.620
 considered by many to be the greatest fighter

00:05.620 --> 00:08.260
 in the history of UFC and MMA,

00:08.260 --> 00:09.620
 but even more than that,

00:09.620 --> 00:13.360
 one of the greatest martial artists ever.

00:13.360 --> 00:17.620
 Quick mention of our sponsors, AllForm, ExpressVPN,

00:17.620 --> 00:21.700
 Blinkist, TheraGun, and TheInformation.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.980
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:24.980 --> 00:28.260
 As a side note, let me say that getting the chance

00:28.260 --> 00:31.240
 to hang out with George, talk to him on the podcast,

00:31.240 --> 00:35.640
 record a quick self defense video that I'll release soon.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.320
 All while both of us wearing suits

00:38.320 --> 00:41.440
 was one of the most memorable days of my life.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.720
 In setting all this up, I talked to Joe Rogan

00:43.720 --> 00:45.720
 and then originally we couldn't schedule a chat

00:45.720 --> 00:48.320
 with him and George on the JRE,

00:48.320 --> 00:51.520
 which allowed me to pretend for a brief time

00:51.520 --> 00:54.860
 that George came down to Austin just to see me.

00:54.860 --> 00:57.000
 Who the hell am I?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.040
 In truth, him and Joe probably conspired

00:59.040 --> 01:01.720
 to make me feel special, but that's the point.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.480
 It's inspiring to see George and Joe,

01:04.480 --> 01:06.520
 who are at the top of their field,

01:06.520 --> 01:09.280
 treat others as equals, as human beings,

01:09.280 --> 01:13.600
 no matter who they are, even silly Russians in a suit.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.720
 Meeting George was an honor for me beyond words.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.280
 This is Alex Friedman podcast,

01:20.280 --> 01:22.000
 and here's my conversation

01:22.000 --> 01:24.800
 with my longtime martial arts hero,

01:24.800 --> 01:28.400
 and now my friend, Mr. George Sampierre.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.680
 In your fighting career,

01:30.680 --> 01:34.600
 were you're more motivated by the love of winning

01:34.600 --> 01:37.800
 or the fear and hatred of losing?

01:37.800 --> 01:41.680
 I like to win better than I hate to lose

01:41.680 --> 01:44.600
 because if it would not have been the case,

01:44.600 --> 01:46.720
 I would never have fought in the first place

01:46.720 --> 01:49.340
 because I don't like to fight at all.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.640
 But you talked about the anxiety,

01:52.640 --> 01:55.200
 the fear that you experienced leading up to a fight.

01:55.200 --> 01:59.800
 So to you, ultimately, the reason to go through that

02:00.760 --> 02:03.920
 difficult process is because it feels damn good

02:03.920 --> 02:05.240
 to have your hand raised.

02:06.440 --> 02:07.880
 There is that.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.000
 There is also the fact that martial art,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.640
 I've been introduced when I was very young,

02:14.640 --> 02:18.120
 and it's probably the best thing I can do in my life,

02:18.120 --> 02:20.620
 fighting, that's what I do best.

02:20.620 --> 02:25.620
 Also, it provides me of freedom,

02:25.980 --> 02:30.980
 of access of things that most of people do not have,

02:32.780 --> 02:34.220
 but all that as a price.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.060
 And a lot of money,

02:35.060 --> 02:37.060
 I made a lot of money, of course, with it.

02:38.180 --> 02:42.300
 I was maybe predisposed with certain abilities.

02:43.180 --> 02:47.300
 I met incredible mentors throughout my life.

02:47.300 --> 02:52.300
 I worked really hard, and of course, I had a lot of chances.

02:53.060 --> 02:54.860
 The stars were all aligned.

02:55.860 --> 03:00.860
 And in order to keep those advantages of freedom,

03:03.140 --> 03:05.660
 money, and glory, and access of things

03:05.660 --> 03:06.660
 that most people don't have,

03:06.660 --> 03:10.900
 and have these dream life that I have,

03:10.900 --> 03:14.500
 I had to sacrifice myself and fight in order to keep it.

03:14.500 --> 03:18.500
 It's very hard to understand,

03:18.500 --> 03:22.780
 because I also believe most fighters are not like me.

03:22.780 --> 03:26.540
 They, a lot of guys, because I corner a lot of guys,

03:26.540 --> 03:28.940
 and it seems to me that they love their job.

03:28.940 --> 03:32.940
 They enjoyed to go fight in the cage.

03:32.940 --> 03:36.460
 I love to train, I love the science of fighting,

03:36.460 --> 03:38.980
 the sport, to be in good shape,

03:38.980 --> 03:42.460
 the confidence that training in mixed martial art give me.

03:42.460 --> 03:47.460
 However, I do not like the feeling of uncertainty,

03:47.500 --> 03:50.420
 the stress that I have,

03:50.420 --> 03:53.780
 not knowing if I will be badly injured,

03:53.780 --> 03:58.780
 or humiliated, or winning the fight.

03:59.060 --> 04:01.580
 It's, to me, unbearable.

04:01.580 --> 04:04.260
 That's what takes the most out of me.

04:04.260 --> 04:06.420
 More than brain damage, more than anything,

04:06.420 --> 04:08.860
 that's what takes the most out of me.

04:08.860 --> 04:11.460
 But the thing you get from it is the freedom

04:11.460 --> 04:15.500
 that you get because of the money,

04:15.500 --> 04:16.820
 but because of the celebrity,

04:16.820 --> 04:18.660
 because of everything that comes with it.

04:18.660 --> 04:21.540
 So you can be the best version of yourself because of fighting.

04:21.540 --> 04:24.940
 But at the same time, you've said that, quote,

04:24.940 --> 04:27.140
 I don't believe there's pleasure in life.

04:27.140 --> 04:29.860
 I believe there's only a relief from pain.

04:29.860 --> 04:32.140
 We have to suffer to be on top.

04:32.140 --> 04:35.460
 So isn't there something to just the suffering in itself,

04:35.460 --> 04:39.700
 just doing really difficult shit, just to get to the top?

04:39.700 --> 04:42.460
 To explain that, so people can relate to it,

04:42.460 --> 04:44.220
 because not everybody's a fighter.

04:45.220 --> 04:50.220
 I think the best example I can give is,

04:50.220 --> 04:53.460
 let's say you haven't eaten for a long time,

04:53.460 --> 04:55.940
 and you're craving, right?

04:55.940 --> 04:57.180
 So you're suffering.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.860
 And then when it's time to eat, finally,

05:00.860 --> 05:02.860
 you're about to eat your favorite dish.

05:04.020 --> 05:06.580
 It's gonna taste so much better.

05:06.580 --> 05:11.300
 So that's why I believe there's always some sort of sacrifice

05:11.300 --> 05:12.340
 before the pleasure.

05:12.340 --> 05:14.620
 And the more sacrifice you do,

05:15.460 --> 05:18.500
 like they say in fighting, the bigger the risk,

05:18.500 --> 05:20.180
 the bigger is the reward.

05:20.180 --> 05:23.980
 And I feel that's how it is for me.

05:23.980 --> 05:25.380
 Yeah, I feel that with,

05:25.380 --> 05:28.700
 I've started fasting a little bit in the past couple of years,

05:28.700 --> 05:32.860
 and there's nothing as amazing as a delicious meal,

05:32.860 --> 05:34.420
 or anything, actually anything,

05:34.420 --> 05:38.340
 any food when you haven't eaten for several days.

05:38.340 --> 05:40.380
 It's kind of incredible.

05:40.380 --> 05:43.020
 And it's not incredible in this simple way

05:43.020 --> 05:45.700
 of finally I get to eat.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.860
 You get to truly experience the beauty

05:48.860 --> 05:51.620
 of what it is to be alive.

05:51.620 --> 05:53.380
 Like that little piece of food,

05:53.380 --> 05:58.380
 you see all the flavors, you feel just the experience of it

05:58.860 --> 06:03.860
 is ultimately of gratitude, of how awesome it is to be alive.

06:03.860 --> 06:07.260
 But when you eat many times a day and you're picking out,

06:07.260 --> 06:09.700
 you don't get to experience that, and it's fascinating.

06:09.700 --> 06:14.540
 It's really like fasting is one of the most accessible things

06:14.540 --> 06:18.340
 for people, I think, to experience that kind of pairing

06:18.340 --> 06:21.100
 of hardship to pleasure.

06:21.100 --> 06:25.980
 I agree. And in my case, it changed my life on a good way.

06:25.980 --> 06:29.700
 I cannot recommend it to people because everybody is different.

06:29.700 --> 06:34.700
 But after my, to fight Michael Bisping, my last fight,

06:35.300 --> 06:39.220
 was against the champion in the Evier weight class

06:39.220 --> 06:40.980
 that I used to compete at.

06:40.980 --> 06:45.740
 So I thought that if I would gain weight,

06:45.740 --> 06:48.460
 it would increase my performance.

06:48.460 --> 06:50.100
 And I struggled a lot to gain weight.

06:50.100 --> 06:53.660
 I gained a little about eight to 10 pounds.

06:53.660 --> 06:56.020
 Normally I walk around 185 pounds.

06:56.020 --> 06:59.820
 And for that fight, I was walking around 195.

06:59.820 --> 07:04.100
 However, I forced myself to eat like six times a day.

07:04.100 --> 07:07.940
 I was on a very strict diet.

07:07.940 --> 07:10.500
 And I didn't feel, it didn't feel right to me

07:10.500 --> 07:14.580
 because I feel like I was carrying,

07:14.580 --> 07:18.140
 like a little bit like I was carrying a bag on my shoulder.

07:18.140 --> 07:22.180
 And I think it was a bad idea for me

07:22.180 --> 07:27.180
 because when I did the weigh in and I went on a scale at 185,

07:29.820 --> 07:32.060
 I couldn't go back to my initial weight

07:32.060 --> 07:35.540
 that was 195 that I worked so hard

07:35.540 --> 07:37.580
 for several months to get there.

07:38.620 --> 07:41.980
 So I was 190 pound, but I couldn't get back.

07:41.980 --> 07:45.220
 And the morning of the fight, I got sick.

07:45.220 --> 07:49.420
 I had like, we didn't know what it was in the beginning

07:49.420 --> 07:53.740
 because in order to know, to find out what it was,

07:53.740 --> 07:55.780
 I needed to do what they call a colonoscopy.

07:55.780 --> 07:59.220
 They put a camera inside of you and to do that,

07:59.220 --> 08:03.740
 they give you something that makes that empty you.

08:03.740 --> 08:06.900
 And I was trying to gain weight, not to lose weight.

08:06.900 --> 08:10.380
 So I told myself, I'm gonna wait after the fight,

08:10.380 --> 08:13.660
 whatever it is, because it was pretty bad, it was blood.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.100
 And I didn't know what I was.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.820
 I was very concerned.

08:16.820 --> 08:20.140
 I thought I had maybe cancer, I was freaking out.

08:20.140 --> 08:22.620
 So I said, I'm gonna do that fight.

08:22.620 --> 08:25.100
 And then after right away, I'm gonna make a checkup.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.180
 So I did the fight, everything went well.

08:27.180 --> 08:28.860
 I won the fight, I went back home,

08:28.860 --> 08:31.060
 I did the colonoscopy and I got diagnosed

08:31.060 --> 08:32.660
 with ulcer colitis.

08:33.580 --> 08:37.620
 Then I got on very severe medication to get better.

08:37.620 --> 08:39.980
 And I'm not a big fan of medication.

08:39.980 --> 08:44.980
 I always trying to look for more natural way to get better.

08:44.980 --> 08:49.980
 And I found out about fasting and it really changed my life.

08:50.340 --> 08:54.340
 I met Dr. Jason Fong, was one of the world authority

08:56.740 --> 08:58.420
 of fasting.

08:58.420 --> 09:01.580
 He treat diabetes patient with fasting.

09:01.580 --> 09:03.660
 And he gave me a program of fasting

09:03.660 --> 09:07.420
 and it really changed my life.

09:07.420 --> 09:12.420
 And right away, what I did is I went in a CAT scan

09:12.420 --> 09:16.100
 to see the difference because it was right after my fight

09:16.100 --> 09:19.100
 with Michael Bisping and I did the CAT scan.

09:19.100 --> 09:24.100
 So I had my muscle mass, bone density, fat percentage,

09:24.980 --> 09:26.860
 water retention, it's pretty amazing.

09:26.860 --> 09:30.500
 It can show you which harm has more muscle than the other.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.900
 It's very precise.

09:31.900 --> 09:35.380
 And I did it like two months after.

09:35.380 --> 09:40.380
 So I started doing time restricted eating, 16, eight.

09:40.380 --> 09:45.380
 But right away, when I started, I did three days water fast.

09:45.860 --> 09:47.300
 And the Dr. Jason Fong said,

09:47.300 --> 09:49.220
 because I like to train during those days,

09:50.340 --> 09:54.060
 I consume Himalayan salt to make sure,

09:54.060 --> 09:56.380
 because when you sweat, there's a lot of minerals

09:56.380 --> 09:59.740
 to make sure you don't depleted your mineral.

09:59.740 --> 10:03.300
 And when I went, when I compared the two results

10:03.300 --> 10:05.900
 in the CAT scan, I found out my biggest concern

10:05.900 --> 10:07.980
 was to lose muscle mass.

10:07.980 --> 10:10.620
 I found out that I did not lose muscle mass.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.740
 Instead of losing it, it increased a little bit.

10:13.740 --> 10:18.140
 Even though my weight on the scale was lighter,

10:19.020 --> 10:22.140
 I kept the same muscle mass even increases a little bit.

10:22.140 --> 10:24.660
 My bone density increases a little bit.

10:25.540 --> 10:30.020
 My water retention is the biggest thing that decrease.

10:30.020 --> 10:33.500
 So my inflammation and my fat percentage.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.460
 So basically, by looking at the data,

10:36.460 --> 10:40.740
 I found out that by eating so much,

10:40.740 --> 10:42.660
 trying to gain weight to find Michael Bisping,

10:42.660 --> 10:45.660
 I only increases my water retention,

10:45.660 --> 10:48.940
 which is not good because it's dead weight

10:48.940 --> 10:50.700
 and inflammation on you.

10:50.700 --> 10:54.220
 So what was the actual process of fasting?

10:54.220 --> 10:57.660
 You said 16, eight time restricted,

10:57.660 --> 10:59.460
 so intermittent fasting,

10:59.460 --> 11:03.660
 but you also mentioned the three day water fast.

11:03.660 --> 11:05.140
 What did that feel like?

11:05.140 --> 11:07.980
 And you also said training during the three day.

11:07.980 --> 11:09.180
 How did that feel?

11:09.180 --> 11:12.260
 Can you give me some details of this is fascinating?

11:12.260 --> 11:17.260
 So I do three days water fast four times a year.

11:17.780 --> 11:18.620
 Nice.

11:18.620 --> 11:21.580
 For me, I do it, everybody is different,

11:21.580 --> 11:24.420
 but for me, I do it after New Year's

11:24.420 --> 11:25.900
 because during the holidays,

11:25.900 --> 11:29.260
 that's when I eat bad foods and I drink.

11:29.260 --> 11:31.620
 I see it more like a cleansing,

11:31.620 --> 11:34.020
 like a detox, so to speak.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.460
 Mental too, like psychological.

11:35.460 --> 11:38.740
 Yes, I do it after the New Year's,

11:38.740 --> 11:40.660
 right before the summer,

11:40.660 --> 11:43.060
 cut for the beach if I have to be.

11:43.060 --> 11:44.860
 After the summer, because of the summer,

11:44.860 --> 11:47.340
 I've been partying a little bit sometime,

11:47.340 --> 11:51.500
 let myself go, and right before the holidays.

11:51.500 --> 11:55.300
 And I've tried, Dr. Fungi says to me,

11:55.300 --> 11:57.500
 said George, everybody is different

11:57.500 --> 11:59.260
 because I'm a very active person

11:59.260 --> 12:00.820
 and everybody has a different genetic.

12:00.820 --> 12:05.820
 So for me, I feel that three days is the sweet spot

12:06.740 --> 12:08.740
 because I still train during those three days.

12:08.740 --> 12:11.620
 The first two days, I don't change nothing.

12:11.620 --> 12:14.660
 I train regularly on my regular schedule.

12:14.660 --> 12:19.300
 However, on the third day, I modify a little bit.

12:19.300 --> 12:24.300
 I do something more easy and that's how I do it.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.620
 And I've tried before because when I say three days,

12:29.620 --> 12:31.180
 it's my sweet spot.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.500
 I've tried to go up to five days.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.860
 But the problems is after my third days,

12:35.860 --> 12:38.980
 I found out that I had a big problem sleeping.

12:38.980 --> 12:41.780
 I get into a hyperactive mode.

12:41.780 --> 12:44.820
 They call that the entoregator mode,

12:44.820 --> 12:47.580
 you know, like your brain,

12:47.580 --> 12:51.300
 I mean, it's amazing your creativity is at its peak,

12:51.300 --> 12:53.060
 but you cannot sleep very well.

12:53.060 --> 12:56.140
 And sleeping, for me, I think it's very important.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.620
 So that's why I do three days.

12:57.620 --> 12:59.180
 For me, it's my sweet spot.

12:59.180 --> 13:00.020
 That's interesting.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.580
 You're right, it's the four or five days

13:01.580 --> 13:04.700
 when you start, see sleep is not important for me.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.380
 So the creativity is really important.

13:07.380 --> 13:08.860
 So it's very interesting

13:08.860 --> 13:12.180
 the places your mind goes after a few days, you're right.

13:12.180 --> 13:16.740
 But I mean, what does it do to your mind?

13:16.740 --> 13:18.780
 So you mentioned your body likes it.

13:18.780 --> 13:21.980
 In terms of training, do you find

13:21.980 --> 13:23.780
 that it helps you focus and think?

13:23.780 --> 13:27.420
 I mean, you're one of the great strategic thinkers

13:27.420 --> 13:28.420
 in terms of martial arts.

13:28.420 --> 13:29.940
 Does it help with learning?

13:29.940 --> 13:31.100
 Does it help with thinking?

13:31.100 --> 13:33.500
 Does it help with strategizing and all that?

13:33.500 --> 13:37.580
 Well, unfortunately, I got into fasting

13:37.580 --> 13:39.300
 after I retired.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.340
 I wish I would have,

13:40.340 --> 13:42.860
 I really wish people asked me,

13:42.860 --> 13:45.700
 would you have done it during the time that you competed?

13:45.700 --> 13:47.180
 And the answer is yes.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.700
 I think we live in a society that

13:50.700 --> 13:52.860
 we're bombarded by publicity.

13:52.860 --> 13:55.860
 Oh, buy this, eat protein, this, that.

13:55.860 --> 13:59.380
 And fasting, nobody makes money with it

13:59.380 --> 14:02.380
 because there's nothing to sell, you know?

14:02.380 --> 14:06.260
 I think that's why a lot of people have not heard about it.

14:06.260 --> 14:09.820
 And even for myself, if someone would have talked to me

14:09.820 --> 14:14.540
 about the benefits of fasting, when I was training,

14:14.540 --> 14:19.540
 before I got sick, I would probably have ignored him

14:20.340 --> 14:24.860
 because I'm not, you know, it was, it's hard to believe.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.420
 It sounds ridiculous, don't eat.

14:26.420 --> 14:27.260
 It sounds, yes.

14:27.260 --> 14:28.380
 It's gonna help your mind

14:28.380 --> 14:30.580
 and you're going to gain muscle potentially.

14:30.580 --> 14:34.020
 Exactly, and perhaps people have talked to me about it,

14:34.020 --> 14:36.660
 but I kind of, it went in one of my hair

14:36.660 --> 14:39.580
 and got out from the other side, you know?

14:39.580 --> 14:42.140
 But it really changed my life.

14:42.140 --> 14:45.820
 And I was diagnosed with ulcer colitis

14:45.820 --> 14:49.620
 and it helps me get rid of all my symptoms.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.420
 What I do is, I know a lot of people have ulcer colitis

14:52.420 --> 14:57.020
 and for me, I cannot recommend it to other people

14:57.020 --> 14:58.420
 because everybody is different,

14:58.420 --> 15:03.260
 but for me, I made a lot of research of our people

15:04.300 --> 15:05.660
 from ulcer colitis got better

15:05.660 --> 15:09.780
 and I found out that a lot of people that got that condition

15:09.780 --> 15:11.900
 get better in the natural way through fasting,

15:11.900 --> 15:15.540
 eating fermented food, collagen, and bone broth

15:15.540 --> 15:17.820
 and stuff all that got.

15:17.820 --> 15:20.060
 And it made a huge difference in my life.

15:20.060 --> 15:22.420
 I just wish I would have known that before.

15:22.420 --> 15:25.900
 So do you have a specific diet wise stuff you like?

15:25.900 --> 15:27.980
 So like, you know, I've recently,

15:27.980 --> 15:29.780
 another ridiculous sounding thing,

15:29.780 --> 15:32.140
 but it makes me feel really good.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.460
 It's very low carbs.

15:33.460 --> 15:36.180
 So, you know, keto or even carnivore,

15:36.180 --> 15:37.620
 it sounds ridiculous.

15:37.620 --> 15:39.260
 It doesn't make any sense,

15:39.260 --> 15:42.380
 but it makes me feel really good even for performance.

15:42.380 --> 15:44.380
 Is Rogan has influenced you, huh?

15:44.380 --> 15:45.820
 He's a carnivore diet.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.580
 I was influenced actually by people.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.900
 Yeah, well, I'll tell you where,

15:50.900 --> 15:53.300
 because I was doing it before he was doing it,

15:53.300 --> 15:58.020
 is it was popular in the endurance athlete community

15:58.020 --> 16:00.300
 where it was fat adapted athletes.

16:00.300 --> 16:04.220
 People who, insane people who run 50 miles, 100 miles,

16:04.220 --> 16:09.140
 they figured out that they could fuel their body with fat.

16:09.140 --> 16:11.820
 They can go to fat as the source of energy

16:11.820 --> 16:12.980
 as opposed to carbs.

16:12.980 --> 16:17.500
 So, I remember hoping that I'll be able to,

16:17.500 --> 16:20.540
 be able to learn how to run 50 miles and so on.

16:20.540 --> 16:22.340
 I've never done more than 22,

16:22.340 --> 16:27.340
 but it, I just remember switching away from carbs

16:29.060 --> 16:32.140
 and feeling really liberated.

16:32.140 --> 16:34.020
 Like I wasn't thinking about food as much.

16:34.020 --> 16:37.980
 I'm able to eat once a day and feel really good.

16:37.980 --> 16:40.780
 I mean, I think everybody's body is different,

16:40.780 --> 16:43.460
 but I think carbs make me lazy.

16:44.540 --> 16:46.500
 Maybe it's because there's,

16:46.500 --> 16:49.620
 yeah, it's the crash, but also just psychologically,

16:49.620 --> 16:54.420
 something, it forced me to also think about food too much.

16:54.420 --> 16:57.180
 Like it starts becoming, you know,

16:57.180 --> 16:59.420
 just like you said, our society is so much about food.

16:59.420 --> 17:01.180
 There's so many, so much advertisement

17:01.180 --> 17:03.420
 and so much of our social life is about food.

17:03.420 --> 17:07.100
 And so, it's very easy to live life,

17:07.100 --> 17:10.660
 like live day to day thinking, when is the next meal?

17:10.660 --> 17:11.820
 Like, what am I gonna eat for lunch?

17:11.820 --> 17:12.740
 What am I gonna eat for dinner?

17:12.740 --> 17:14.740
 What am I gonna eat for breakfast?

17:14.740 --> 17:17.180
 And if you're not careful,

17:17.180 --> 17:20.500
 that's gonna get in the way of you doing cool shit

17:20.500 --> 17:23.780
 for like liberating yourself and thinking like,

17:23.780 --> 17:25.940
 what am I actually passionate about in this life?

17:25.940 --> 17:29.100
 Like creating and forgetting to eat those kinds of things

17:29.100 --> 17:31.700
 and still being able to fuel your body.

17:31.700 --> 17:32.540
 I don't know.

17:32.540 --> 17:37.020
 It's been fascinating to figure out like later in life

17:37.020 --> 17:41.020
 that carbs aren't necessary to function well.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.220
 It makes me think like,

17:42.220 --> 17:44.020
 we don't know anything about nutrition.

17:44.020 --> 17:44.860
 That's right.

17:44.860 --> 17:49.020
 You know, personally,

17:49.020 --> 17:53.060
 I don't think I could have a diet without carbs.

17:53.060 --> 17:54.820
 I love chocolate too much.

17:54.820 --> 17:57.180
 For me, eating, it's a pleasure of life.

17:57.180 --> 17:58.020
 I love my carbs.

17:58.020 --> 17:59.500
 I love my sugar.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.140
 However, if you talk about diet,

18:01.140 --> 18:03.180
 I don't have a specific diet.

18:03.180 --> 18:07.780
 But recently, what I'm trying to do is,

18:07.780 --> 18:12.340
 the days that I do not work out, I only eat once.

18:12.340 --> 18:14.780
 That's kind of my rules.

18:14.780 --> 18:17.500
 Plus, I try to respect 16, eight

18:17.500 --> 18:22.260
 and do my three day fast four time a year.

18:22.260 --> 18:24.060
 But the rest of the thing,

18:24.060 --> 18:29.060
 I let myself loose because I don't think I would be happy

18:29.500 --> 18:34.500
 if I don't give myself the right to eat.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.900
 For me personally, I love to eat so much.

18:37.900 --> 18:38.740
 Thanks.

18:38.740 --> 18:41.940
 And you talk about diet carnivore diet,

18:41.940 --> 18:45.860
 it's very interesting because a few years ago,

18:45.860 --> 18:49.220
 I went to Africa in Masai Mara.

18:49.220 --> 18:54.220
 And it's a tribe in East Africa.

18:54.340 --> 18:56.940
 And I went to visit them.

18:56.940 --> 18:58.820
 I did a safari.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.180
 And I talked to them.

19:00.180 --> 19:05.180
 And these guys, their diet is 99% carnivore.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.860
 They, that's crazy.

19:06.860 --> 19:09.220
 And you should see, they're very beautiful people.

19:09.220 --> 19:10.740
 I shred it like that.

19:10.740 --> 19:12.260
 Some people would say, oh, it's genetic.

19:12.260 --> 19:13.420
 I'm like, yeah, maybe it's genetic.

19:13.420 --> 19:17.380
 But I mean, and think about the Eskimos also,

19:17.380 --> 19:21.460
 that like most of their diet is on fish, right?

19:21.460 --> 19:24.620
 So I believe it can be done, you know?

19:24.620 --> 19:26.020
 Like I believe it can be done

19:26.020 --> 19:27.980
 like an exclusive carnivore diet.

19:27.980 --> 19:31.540
 And I think I'm gonna try it pretty soon

19:31.540 --> 19:33.540
 just to have the experience, you know?

19:33.540 --> 19:34.580
 To see how it feels like.

19:34.580 --> 19:37.100
 Well, you're gonna hang out with Joe.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.180
 Be careful bringing it up

19:38.180 --> 19:40.420
 because he'll convince you to forever switch

19:40.420 --> 19:41.460
 to carnivore, definitely.

19:41.460 --> 19:42.580
 He loves it.

19:42.580 --> 19:47.180
 I mean, but just like you, I think he loves food.

19:47.180 --> 19:50.660
 So he can't ever stay on carnivore.

19:50.660 --> 19:52.900
 It was funny because we went to an Italian restaurant

19:52.900 --> 19:55.500
 together and I still only eat meat.

19:55.500 --> 20:00.500
 Like I love the constraints of discipline.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.420
 That's partially why I like carnivore.

20:03.420 --> 20:06.420
 I like saying no to food that is delicious.

20:06.420 --> 20:11.420
 But a part of the problem is that

20:11.740 --> 20:12.740
 I don't know how to moderate.

20:12.740 --> 20:13.700
 You said chocolate.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.220
 I don't know how to have one chocolate.

20:15.220 --> 20:17.380
 Is that something you're able to do?

20:17.380 --> 20:19.900
 Have like in moderation?

20:19.900 --> 20:22.620
 No, it's when I have an opportunity, I do it.

20:22.620 --> 20:23.460
 I don't have any.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.180
 I'm an extremist person.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.460
 Like I, that's the thing.

20:27.460 --> 20:32.220
 I, when I have a chance, I like, I just eat.

20:32.220 --> 20:33.060
 I go too much.

20:33.060 --> 20:34.500
 And that's why I like about my life.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.980
 You know, that's what I like about fasting

20:36.980 --> 20:40.580
 because probably if I would not have discovered fasting,

20:40.580 --> 20:42.740
 eating chocolate would give me cramps

20:42.740 --> 20:44.820
 and all sorts of problems.

20:44.820 --> 20:47.020
 Cause people on ulcer colitis,

20:47.020 --> 20:48.380
 normally they cannot eat chocolate.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.540
 They cannot drink alcohol.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.940
 But I believe because I'm fasting,

20:52.940 --> 20:56.180
 that's the reason why I'm medication,

20:56.180 --> 20:57.860
 medicine, medication free.

20:57.860 --> 21:00.060
 I can eat whatever I want, whatever I want.

21:00.060 --> 21:02.700
 But I have to do that fasting, you know?

21:02.700 --> 21:05.100
 And now it becomes to a, it became to a point

21:05.100 --> 21:07.100
 that it's no longer hard for me.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.140
 It's like normal.

21:08.140 --> 21:10.420
 I don't even force myself.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.020
 I don't, it's easy.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.220
 You know what I mean?

21:13.220 --> 21:16.700
 Some of my friends thinks I'm insane, you know?

21:16.700 --> 21:19.740
 But I tell them, it's like when you get used to it,

21:19.740 --> 21:21.340
 it becomes like an habit.

21:21.340 --> 21:24.340
 And I'm, and I know that on Turgata,

21:24.340 --> 21:27.460
 like our ancestor did not eat three times a day.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.060
 It's not true.

21:30.060 --> 21:32.340
 They ate when they could

21:32.340 --> 21:35.820
 and when they eat, they feed themselves

21:35.820 --> 21:37.220
 as much as they can until that,

21:37.220 --> 21:38.140
 because the next time,

21:38.140 --> 21:41.620
 because they didn't know when they could eat again, right?

21:41.620 --> 21:46.300
 So it's, I think that's how we're built, you know?

21:46.300 --> 21:49.140
 To have this similar lifestyle.

21:50.660 --> 21:51.740
 If we could take a step back

21:51.740 --> 21:54.460
 to the discussion about fear a little bit.

21:54.460 --> 21:58.060
 So Mike Tyson talks about this process

21:58.060 --> 22:00.020
 of him walking to the ring.

22:00.020 --> 22:02.060
 He sounds similar to you in many ways

22:02.060 --> 22:05.140
 of the anxiety and the fear that he experiences.

22:05.140 --> 22:09.300
 And he has this sort of story

22:09.300 --> 22:11.620
 that he tells about walking to the ring

22:11.620 --> 22:13.980
 and being supremely afraid.

22:13.980 --> 22:16.380
 But as he walks and gets closer and steps in,

22:16.380 --> 22:19.740
 he finds the confidence and becomes supremely confident.

22:19.740 --> 22:21.460
 I think he calls himself like a God.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.900
 I feel like a God in the ring.

22:23.900 --> 22:26.340
 Is, do you go through a similar process

22:26.340 --> 22:27.780
 of finding the confidence?

22:27.780 --> 22:31.540
 Well, it, yes.

22:31.540 --> 22:35.820
 And I use James Lange theory.

22:37.900 --> 22:41.660
 So what I do is because I'm not afraid

22:41.660 --> 22:43.180
 to admit that I'm afraid.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.820
 And in the beginning of my career,

22:48.940 --> 22:51.100
 I really thought, I asked myself,

22:51.100 --> 22:53.580
 because I was very good in mixed martial art,

22:53.580 --> 22:56.060
 but I really thought I wasn't made for this

22:56.060 --> 23:01.060
 because the idea of fighting didn't make me happy.

23:03.220 --> 23:06.060
 It's something like I was forced to do

23:06.060 --> 23:09.660
 in order to keep that lifestyle that I have

23:10.740 --> 23:12.580
 and achieve my goal, perhaps one day

23:12.580 --> 23:14.700
 to make enough money to retire.

23:14.700 --> 23:16.940
 And you know, that was my dream.

23:16.940 --> 23:19.860
 But when I was looking around the gym

23:19.860 --> 23:21.260
 where I was training,

23:21.260 --> 23:22.900
 most of my training partner, they were happy.

23:22.900 --> 23:23.740
 They were excited.

23:23.740 --> 23:25.900
 And sometimes I corner a lot of guys

23:25.900 --> 23:27.620
 and they're happy and they're in the locker room.

23:27.620 --> 23:30.620
 They don't react the same way I do.

23:30.620 --> 23:34.580
 Some perhaps does, but if you see me in the locker room,

23:36.500 --> 23:38.860
 like when I get, like my last fight with Michael Bisping,

23:38.860 --> 23:40.140
 just to give you an example.

23:40.140 --> 23:42.420
 In my last fight with Michael Bisping,

23:42.420 --> 23:45.460
 because it's fresh, it's the one that is the most recent.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.380
 And, but it's always the same thing.

23:47.380 --> 23:51.060
 My last fight in Bisping, I get in the locker room.

23:51.060 --> 23:56.060
 I had like three guys that I trained with, Mickey Gull,

23:56.180 --> 23:59.580
 Eman Zahabi and Joseph Duffy.

23:59.580 --> 24:00.420
 They all lost.

24:00.420 --> 24:04.580
 It was like, like, my locker room was basically cursed.

24:04.580 --> 24:07.340
 You know, when you're in a locker room

24:07.340 --> 24:10.380
 and people from your locker room leave for a fight

24:10.380 --> 24:12.340
 and then they come back, it's kind of a momentum.

24:12.340 --> 24:14.660
 You know, you shake and yeah, good job.

24:14.660 --> 24:15.500
 Now it's my thing.

24:15.500 --> 24:19.580
 You know, it's kind of a team brotherhood sort of thing.

24:19.580 --> 24:24.580
 So the atmosphere in my locker room was pretty bad.

24:26.820 --> 24:30.540
 It was like going to a, you know, like a funeral.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.300
 So I was very scared.

24:34.300 --> 24:37.020
 And before every fight, I asked myself,

24:37.020 --> 24:41.260
 I asked myself, always, shit, what the hell I'm doing here?

24:41.260 --> 24:43.100
 Why did I choose to come back?

24:43.100 --> 24:43.940
 Oh my God.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.300
 And I'm freaking out.

24:45.300 --> 24:50.300
 However, I'm putting on a mask, like I'm acting.

24:51.380 --> 24:54.700
 Because if I don't do that, it will reflect on my coaches.

24:54.700 --> 24:58.700
 And if my coach, the confidence of my coaches is affected,

24:58.700 --> 25:00.340
 it will reflect on me.

25:00.340 --> 25:02.580
 So I need to feel strong.

25:02.580 --> 25:07.580
 I need to make them believe that I'm excited to be there

25:07.820 --> 25:08.980
 and I'm happy to be there.

25:08.980 --> 25:13.380
 So this sort of play start when I get,

25:13.380 --> 25:15.260
 when I first step in the locker room,

25:15.260 --> 25:17.780
 even though I feel completely different,

25:17.780 --> 25:20.140
 but that's how I play it.

25:20.140 --> 25:24.180
 Normally the fight day, I never felt, feel 100%.

25:24.180 --> 25:26.460
 I always felt exhausted, tired.

25:27.620 --> 25:30.940
 My highs are hitching because I don't sleep enough

25:30.940 --> 25:32.060
 the few nights before,

25:32.060 --> 25:35.140
 because I'm constantly rehearsing scenarios

25:35.140 --> 25:37.540
 that might happen in the fight.

25:37.540 --> 25:42.540
 So mentally, it's not that I'm not on top.

25:42.660 --> 25:44.060
 But you keep all that to yourself.

25:44.060 --> 25:48.620
 I keep it to myself and I'm lying to everybody around me.

25:48.620 --> 25:50.260
 But everybody knows, you know?

25:51.580 --> 25:54.580
 Faraz, John, then I heard, they know Freddie Rose,

25:54.580 --> 25:55.740
 they've been with me for a long time.

25:55.740 --> 25:56.780
 So they know what's going on,

25:56.780 --> 25:58.420
 but at least I'm lying to them.

25:58.420 --> 26:00.020
 I'm like, hey, I'm feeling great.

26:00.020 --> 26:02.900
 So, and seeing all my training partner,

26:02.900 --> 26:05.620
 like very disappointed because they lost their fight,

26:05.620 --> 26:08.780
 some were badly hurt as well.

26:08.780 --> 26:10.420
 It was hard.

26:10.420 --> 26:12.180
 So, and I remember I get one,

26:12.180 --> 26:15.140
 I get, I start to warm up and everything.

26:15.140 --> 26:19.300
 And as you start to warm up, you become a different person

26:19.300 --> 26:23.420
 because, you know, we know that certain posture

26:23.420 --> 26:26.980
 and yoga can affect your mental state.

26:26.980 --> 26:29.220
 But I would say it's a little bit the same thing

26:29.220 --> 26:30.260
 in fighting, you know?

26:30.260 --> 26:32.740
 Like when you started hitting the pads,

26:32.740 --> 26:36.220
 your muscle memory, your instincts comes back

26:36.220 --> 26:39.500
 and you remember that you're good at this, you know?

26:39.500 --> 26:41.980
 And your confidence starts to grow.

26:41.980 --> 26:44.020
 And as seeing your trainers holding the pad

26:44.020 --> 26:47.900
 and repeating your moves, it makes you also remember

26:47.900 --> 26:50.860
 all the sacrifice you have done to your training camp

26:50.860 --> 26:54.980
 and confidence comes from how you prepared yourself.

26:54.980 --> 26:58.580
 And even you're afraid, you can be confident,

26:58.580 --> 26:59.740
 confident at the same time.

26:59.740 --> 27:03.340
 Being afraid and being confident is two different things.

27:03.340 --> 27:07.140
 And before every fight, just right before I walk in,

27:08.220 --> 27:11.460
 it's when I'm scared, I go in the bathroom

27:11.460 --> 27:12.700
 and I look at myself in the mirror.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.860
 I used to have a bandana and a gi,

27:14.860 --> 27:18.220
 but now I didn't have this for my last fight

27:18.220 --> 27:22.100
 because of the new Reebok deal they had.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.220
 But I did the same rehearsal that I always do.

27:24.220 --> 27:25.220
 I look at myself in the mirror

27:25.220 --> 27:27.980
 and I start to compliment myself.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.180
 Like even if I don't believe it,

27:30.180 --> 27:32.020
 I'm starting to trying to believe it.

27:32.020 --> 27:34.060
 As I am, I'm finding all the reason

27:34.060 --> 27:35.940
 why I'm gonna win the fight.

27:35.940 --> 27:39.220
 And all my trainer knows that before every fight,

27:39.220 --> 27:42.100
 when the guy from the UFC goes and step in my room

27:42.100 --> 27:43.180
 and say, St. Pierre, are you up next?

27:43.180 --> 27:47.580
 I always take a few minutes to do that same rehearsal.

27:47.580 --> 27:49.420
 And I tell myself, I'm gonna win this fight

27:49.420 --> 27:52.700
 because I'm better and I'm very cocky about myself.

27:52.700 --> 27:56.020
 I'm telling all the reasons that I'm gonna win.

27:56.020 --> 27:58.940
 I got a better team, I made more sacrifice.

27:58.940 --> 28:01.740
 I'm faster, I'm more powerful, way more athletic.

28:01.740 --> 28:03.460
 My fighting IQ is better than him.

28:03.460 --> 28:05.300
 I got a strategy on point

28:05.300 --> 28:07.660
 that he's never gonna be able to keep up with.

28:07.660 --> 28:09.500
 And this and that.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.700
 And I was telling myself,

28:11.700 --> 28:14.940
 I'm gonna show these young kids how things should be done.

28:14.940 --> 28:16.860
 I'm trying to boost myself.

28:16.860 --> 28:18.300
 Try to boost yourself.

28:18.300 --> 28:19.740
 And you start to believe in it.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.500
 You become a different person.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.180
 So when you walk out the bathroom,

28:24.180 --> 28:25.540
 now rock and roll.

28:25.540 --> 28:28.540
 Now, I really believe it for real.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.260
 Like I'm still scared, but I believe it for real.

28:31.260 --> 28:33.780
 And that's the transformation that happened for me right there.

28:33.780 --> 28:37.580
 And from now, from there to the fight,

28:37.580 --> 28:41.940
 until the fight is over, I call it cruise control.

28:41.940 --> 28:44.300
 Because you don't have time to think in a fight.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.980
 If you're trying to think, you're missing the opportunity.

28:46.980 --> 28:49.700
 So that's how I see it for myself.

28:49.700 --> 28:51.020
 So at that point, you stop thinking.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.180
 And you just go cruise control, autopilot.

28:53.180 --> 28:54.740
 Trust yourself, you know?

28:54.740 --> 28:58.940
 Trust yourself because you repeated all the scenarios, you know?

28:58.940 --> 29:00.380
 So everything that you have done,

29:00.380 --> 29:04.140
 it's inside that your computer, your brain is programmed

29:04.140 --> 29:07.460
 to react accordingly to certain situations.

29:07.460 --> 29:11.460
 And it's not the night of the fight that you will tell yourself,

29:11.460 --> 29:13.700
 oh, finally, I'm going to do this if you do this now.

29:13.700 --> 29:18.100
 Now, if you have not practiced it before, you're screwed.

29:18.100 --> 29:22.540
 The preparation, the repetition, that makes it happen, you know?

29:22.540 --> 29:26.380
 What about like the really difficult moments in a fight

29:26.380 --> 29:31.780
 where you are tested to your limits, essentially?

29:31.780 --> 29:34.300
 Usually it's cardio related exhaustion, right?

29:34.300 --> 29:36.420
 Where you have to ask yourself that same question.

29:36.420 --> 29:38.540
 It's like, why the hell am I doing this?

29:38.540 --> 29:39.540
 Yes.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.620
 Do you experience those?

29:41.620 --> 29:43.940
 Or are you able to ride through the autopilot?

29:43.940 --> 29:46.700
 And if you do, what do you do in those moments?

29:46.700 --> 29:47.660
 Never in a fight.

29:47.660 --> 29:52.220
 When I'm in a fight, when the fight is on,

29:52.220 --> 29:53.340
 I never change my mind.

29:53.340 --> 29:56.220
 I go until the end.

29:56.220 --> 30:00.420
 However, for example, my first fight would be JPN.

30:00.420 --> 30:03.020
 I had a terrible first round.

30:03.020 --> 30:04.980
 So I had to switch gear.

30:04.980 --> 30:06.700
 That happened sometime.

30:06.700 --> 30:08.340
 But it's part of my plan.

30:08.340 --> 30:12.860
 I always have a plan B, plan A, plan B, plan C.

30:12.860 --> 30:13.660
 You need to have that.

30:13.660 --> 30:15.740
 If fighters goes into a fight thinking,

30:15.740 --> 30:17.940
 oh, what I'm going to do this is this,

30:17.940 --> 30:21.060
 and they don't have a plan B, if this doesn't work,

30:21.060 --> 30:22.820
 that's mean they're not well prepared.

30:22.820 --> 30:24.820
 If you talk to me before every fight,

30:24.820 --> 30:29.380
 I can like in 30 seconds give you my old strategy, you know?

30:29.380 --> 30:32.220
 For BJPN, my first fight with BJPN was,

30:32.220 --> 30:35.460
 oh, I'm going to keep it standing up,

30:35.460 --> 30:37.180
 keep the fight from the outside, you know,

30:37.180 --> 30:38.780
 because I'm faster than him.

30:38.780 --> 30:40.580
 Then the fight would be JPN start.

30:40.580 --> 30:44.060
 I found out that I was not faster than him.

30:44.060 --> 30:49.420
 And I found out that his reaction time was better than mine.

30:49.420 --> 30:52.620
 So I got beat up the first round,

30:52.620 --> 30:54.780
 and I got out of the blood, you know, and everything.

30:54.780 --> 30:58.380
 So my plan B was now I'm going to wrestle him.

30:58.380 --> 30:59.580
 You know, I'm going to wrestle him,

30:59.580 --> 31:02.740
 and you know, make him tired and trying to put him down.

31:02.740 --> 31:06.460
 And that's how I beat him, because I switch gear, you know?

31:06.460 --> 31:07.740
 But if you can't do that,

31:07.740 --> 31:10.700
 if you cannot find a way to become the perfect nemesis

31:10.700 --> 31:13.700
 to your opponent, you might win if you fight,

31:13.700 --> 31:18.700
 but you're going to fight someone sooner or later

31:19.060 --> 31:23.460
 that will give you a lot of trouble.

31:23.460 --> 31:25.140
 So that's where the anxiety pays off.

31:25.140 --> 31:26.900
 You're anticipating all the ways it goes wrong.

31:26.900 --> 31:30.420
 So you've developed a plan B and plan C.

31:30.420 --> 31:34.740
 Hi, you know, we talked a lot with like John Donahur,

31:34.740 --> 31:36.020
 who you work with.

31:36.020 --> 31:36.860
 It's interesting.

31:36.860 --> 31:39.820
 I don't think I've heard him talk about plan B and plan C.

31:39.820 --> 31:43.900
 He usually has a really clear plan A,

31:43.900 --> 31:45.700
 an entire system of plan A.

31:45.700 --> 31:46.980
 I don't think I've heard him.

31:46.980 --> 31:51.100
 We've had a good discussion about it

31:51.100 --> 31:54.900
 and over some cheeseburgers.

31:54.900 --> 31:59.900
 And he was kind of espousing the value of mastering escapes.

32:02.060 --> 32:05.700
 So when you find yourself in bad situations,

32:05.700 --> 32:07.900
 being exceptionally good at finding ways

32:07.900 --> 32:09.460
 out of those bad situations,

32:09.460 --> 32:11.340
 and that's a way of dominance.

32:11.340 --> 32:13.980
 There's nothing, there's no better way

32:13.980 --> 32:16.540
 to dominate your opponent, according to him,

32:16.540 --> 32:18.780
 than to show that they can't possibly hurt you

32:18.780 --> 32:21.300
 no matter how bad the position is.

32:21.300 --> 32:24.140
 It's like, as opposed to a physical dominance,

32:24.140 --> 32:25.700
 it's a psychological dominance.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.100
 It's very interesting.

32:27.100 --> 32:32.100
 But I wonder if he has plan B and plan C in his mind too.

32:32.580 --> 32:34.660
 You know, in mixed martial arts,

32:34.660 --> 32:36.100
 sometimes it's like in science,

32:36.100 --> 32:38.460
 sometimes you can make a mistake, you know?

32:38.460 --> 32:41.820
 Like every human can make a mistake, you know?

32:41.820 --> 32:44.220
 There's certain sport or a certain situation

32:44.220 --> 32:49.220
 that if there's a mistake made, that's it, exactly.

32:49.620 --> 32:51.860
 Sometimes it's the case in MMA,

32:51.860 --> 32:55.180
 but sometimes you're able to redeem yourself.

32:55.180 --> 33:00.180
 And if you look, the fight with BJPan1 that I had,

33:01.420 --> 33:03.780
 which was probably one of the most competitive fight,

33:03.780 --> 33:05.340
 and it was probably the,

33:05.340 --> 33:08.780
 it was the fight that I got the most damage.

33:08.780 --> 33:09.740
 And I was messed up.

33:09.740 --> 33:11.980
 It took me three days, like two, three days

33:11.980 --> 33:13.100
 to recuperate from that fight.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.980
 I was really damaged.

33:14.980 --> 33:17.900
 And my first fight versus my second fight,

33:17.900 --> 33:19.940
 I made a lot of adjustment

33:19.940 --> 33:22.700
 because I have learned from my first fight.

33:22.700 --> 33:26.220
 And also I had a guy, one thing people don't know,

33:26.220 --> 33:29.140
 like they talk about fighters having secret weapons.

33:29.140 --> 33:32.140
 See, for me, my secret weapons was not,

33:32.140 --> 33:34.180
 like some is that they use like certain,

33:34.180 --> 33:35.060
 like different things.

33:35.060 --> 33:36.820
 For me, it was knowledge.

33:36.820 --> 33:40.420
 I had a guy in Montreal, he was measuring frames.

33:40.420 --> 33:43.980
 He's not a scientist, he's a friend of Ferris and I.

33:43.980 --> 33:47.700
 And what he does, he watch fight and he measure frames.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.940
 But the way he does it is when you watch a fight

33:49.940 --> 33:51.980
 and one of the guy throw a punch,

33:51.980 --> 33:55.180
 he cut the picture by frame, the video by frame.

33:55.180 --> 33:56.620
 Clap, clap, clap, clap.

33:56.620 --> 34:01.180
 So he's able to see which fighter has better reaction time

34:01.180 --> 34:02.820
 than others.

34:02.820 --> 34:07.820
 And BJPan, he found out that BJPan evolved the UFC roster

34:07.820 --> 34:09.380
 at the time when he was in his prime.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.780
 He had probably the best reaction time of all.

34:12.700 --> 34:16.020
 According to him, Leo Tomashido was the second one.

34:16.020 --> 34:17.860
 But BJPan was the first one.

34:17.860 --> 34:21.540
 So I knew that if I would try to go first

34:21.540 --> 34:23.660
 because I always been the fastest guy

34:23.660 --> 34:25.700
 normally when I fight someone.

34:25.700 --> 34:28.340
 But when I fought BJPan, I tried to go first

34:28.340 --> 34:29.780
 and he was always able to,

34:30.740 --> 34:34.100
 like I never, it was never able to touch him with my jab

34:34.100 --> 34:36.100
 and he came back with the counter punch.

34:37.340 --> 34:41.020
 However, because of what he told me,

34:41.020 --> 34:43.540
 I knew that BJPan has a very fast reaction time

34:43.540 --> 34:46.020
 but at a very poor reset time.

34:47.100 --> 34:48.940
 To him, the way he described it to me

34:48.940 --> 34:51.940
 is like your nervous system is like a muscle.

34:51.940 --> 34:55.340
 BJPan was so fast, but he's like more like a sprinter.

34:55.340 --> 34:57.980
 So what I did the second fight, when I fought BJPan,

34:57.980 --> 35:00.420
 I made him flinch, like I fake a lot.

35:00.420 --> 35:02.180
 So I make him react and flinch.

35:02.180 --> 35:05.780
 So all that reaction time that he used to flinch

35:07.020 --> 35:10.140
 was not used properly to avoid my punches.

35:10.140 --> 35:15.140
 So I load up his nervous system with a lot of information

35:15.700 --> 35:18.140
 and fake and to make him flinch

35:18.140 --> 35:21.660
 and pretending I was kicking and wrestling.

35:21.660 --> 35:25.700
 So he got overwhelmed and he got tired very, very fast.

35:25.700 --> 35:26.900
 So that's how I beat him.

35:26.900 --> 35:28.940
 People sometimes they don't know really

35:28.940 --> 35:31.060
 what's the strategy behind the thing.

35:31.060 --> 35:32.500
 They only see the physical part.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.300
 But when you fight someone, if I fight you,

35:34.300 --> 35:36.020
 I look at you in the eyes.

35:36.020 --> 35:39.060
 There's a lot of things that going on between you and I.

35:39.060 --> 35:42.620
 I can look down here, bam, jab you in their face.

35:42.620 --> 35:45.660
 The audience will not see this little detail,

35:45.660 --> 35:47.140
 but you will see it.

35:47.140 --> 35:50.580
 And that's what it makes the magic during a fight.

35:50.580 --> 35:52.980
 The relation that you have with the opponent,

35:52.980 --> 35:55.700
 like the mental game, what you make him believe,

35:55.700 --> 35:58.660
 those little thing I use a lot of those.

35:58.660 --> 36:00.700
 If you talk to a lot of my opponent,

36:00.700 --> 36:03.060
 they'll tell you like I use a lot of these little things.

36:03.060 --> 36:04.900
 Like I look down at Banna, I go up

36:04.900 --> 36:06.940
 or I am pretending I want to attack you.

36:06.940 --> 36:08.860
 So I make you flinch,

36:08.860 --> 36:11.180
 but in reality, I'm just doing this

36:11.180 --> 36:12.540
 because I want to rest.

36:12.540 --> 36:14.340
 I want to recuperate and I'm tired.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.900
 How much is, you know, people talk about that with poker,

36:17.900 --> 36:21.340
 for example, how much is the value of this?

36:21.340 --> 36:23.580
 You know, so like some people argue

36:23.580 --> 36:25.860
 that poker is more about the betting.

36:25.860 --> 36:27.180
 You know, just the money.

36:27.180 --> 36:29.140
 It's just how much you bet and so on.

36:29.140 --> 36:32.580
 So that would be more like the analogy there

36:32.580 --> 36:35.540
 with fighting would be just strictly

36:35.540 --> 36:37.500
 the physical movement of your body.

36:37.500 --> 36:40.140
 And then a lot of people argue that there's a lot here

36:40.140 --> 36:42.660
 in the way you look and the little movements in the face.

36:42.660 --> 36:44.460
 So do you think there's,

36:44.460 --> 36:47.020
 do you think you're communicating with your opponent

36:47.020 --> 36:48.740
 when you look at them?

36:48.740 --> 36:51.220
 There's no way to know for sure a hundred percent

36:51.220 --> 36:54.580
 and I'm by no, no means psychic, nothing like that.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.180
 And I don't believe in that at all.

36:56.180 --> 36:59.220
 The only thing is I know to looking to the eyes

36:59.220 --> 37:01.580
 of my opponent when he's afraid

37:01.580 --> 37:03.660
 and when he gives up on me.

37:03.660 --> 37:07.020
 I've been accused very often in my career

37:07.020 --> 37:10.500
 to not take enough risk, to not finish my opponent.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.380
 But the reason why I didn't finish my opponent

37:12.380 --> 37:15.220
 is because I saw in his eyes that he gave up,

37:15.220 --> 37:17.860
 he gave me the fight and I'm winning the fight.

37:17.860 --> 37:21.620
 So it's not up to me.

37:21.620 --> 37:24.460
 It's not to me to make it, to try to sacrifice myself

37:24.460 --> 37:25.740
 trying to finish him.

37:25.740 --> 37:28.940
 Perhaps if I do that, I will open up for him

37:28.940 --> 37:33.140
 to capitalize on my mistake.

37:33.140 --> 37:35.900
 It's up to him to make a risk.

37:35.900 --> 37:38.460
 So people sometimes they don't understand

37:38.460 --> 37:41.180
 that this is the art of fighting, my friend.

37:41.180 --> 37:44.540
 Like if I'm winning the fight, like in hockey and ice hockey,

37:44.540 --> 37:47.940
 if you're winning the game and it's the third period,

37:47.940 --> 37:49.100
 it's at the end of the third period,

37:49.100 --> 37:50.540
 you're not gonna take out your gold

37:50.540 --> 37:52.060
 and they're trying to score another goal

37:52.060 --> 37:56.980
 because winning five to three or five to four

37:56.980 --> 37:57.940
 is the same thing.

37:57.940 --> 38:00.780
 Same thing in MMA, we make a living out of this.

38:00.780 --> 38:04.940
 And sometimes, you know, as bad as it can be,

38:04.940 --> 38:06.660
 you wanna save yourself for another day,

38:06.660 --> 38:09.060
 you know, you wanna minimize the damage.

38:09.060 --> 38:11.860
 But if he knows he's losing the fight,

38:11.860 --> 38:13.780
 it's up to him to take the risk.

38:13.780 --> 38:15.580
 It's not up to me.

38:15.580 --> 38:17.500
 So I'm a good counter fighter.

38:17.500 --> 38:20.140
 I use a lot of my attack or counter strike

38:20.140 --> 38:23.900
 or reactive takedown or proactive takedown.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.540
 That's my specialty.

38:25.540 --> 38:29.580
 So I'm not gonna, I'd have no desire to sacrifice myself

38:29.580 --> 38:31.860
 trying to finish my opponent.

38:31.860 --> 38:35.620
 If he want to, if perhaps I might give him

38:35.620 --> 38:38.060
 the opportunity to capitalize on me.

38:38.060 --> 38:41.700
 It's not smart to do that.

38:41.700 --> 38:44.420
 And very often when I fight someone,

38:44.420 --> 38:46.900
 I can read him, I see the fear in his eyes.

38:46.900 --> 38:48.580
 Now I'm like, I got you now.

38:48.580 --> 38:49.460
 He's very desperate.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.500
 That doesn't mean I have to put my guard down

38:52.500 --> 38:54.180
 because he's gonna be desperate,

38:54.180 --> 38:55.820
 but I know I'm beating you.

38:55.820 --> 38:56.860
 And I know I'm beating you,

38:56.860 --> 38:58.180
 I'm just gonna do what I need.

38:58.180 --> 38:59.500
 You know, if I have a chance, of course,

38:59.500 --> 39:00.340
 I'll knock him out,

39:00.340 --> 39:04.260
 but I'm not gonna try to sacrifice myself to knock him out.

39:04.260 --> 39:05.500
 And if you do that,

39:06.980 --> 39:08.700
 maybe one day you'll make a mistake

39:08.700 --> 39:09.980
 and you'll get dropped

39:09.980 --> 39:12.340
 and you'll tell yourself that I shoot.

39:12.340 --> 39:14.380
 I just got brain damage.

39:14.380 --> 39:15.900
 Maybe I'm never gonna come back the same.

39:15.900 --> 39:18.620
 Maybe, you know, I ruin my career or, you know,

39:18.620 --> 39:21.900
 it's a very serious game that we're playing.

39:21.900 --> 39:23.620
 It's very dangerous.

39:23.620 --> 39:26.540
 In the face of that risk,

39:26.540 --> 39:29.380
 I mean, Mike Tyson talked about, you know,

39:29.380 --> 39:31.820
 when the opponent looks away,

39:31.820 --> 39:33.980
 he knows he's got him, right?

39:33.980 --> 39:37.020
 That he's broken.

39:38.100 --> 39:41.900
 For a person like me who has trouble making eye contact

39:41.900 --> 39:44.260
 with people, there's truth to that.

39:44.260 --> 39:46.020
 I mean, there's truth to that.

39:46.020 --> 39:49.940
 That there's an animal nature to us looking away.

39:49.940 --> 39:53.180
 I mean, you could see that the way the body language,

39:53.180 --> 39:55.460
 the way the eyes move between two animals

39:55.460 --> 39:59.900
 going at it in the wild when like two lions fight

39:59.900 --> 40:01.820
 or two, whatever fight,

40:01.820 --> 40:06.660
 there's a certain beta move when you've been defeated.

40:06.660 --> 40:09.540
 Yes, or one thing when I know that,

40:09.540 --> 40:12.180
 that when it happened, one of the sign

40:12.180 --> 40:15.420
 is when I just like make a faint and the guy flinch,

40:15.420 --> 40:17.900
 like crazy, that's mean he's really scared of me.

40:17.900 --> 40:20.540
 It's a little bit like you're doing this,

40:20.540 --> 40:22.100
 that guy flinch a little bit, or you're doing this,

40:22.100 --> 40:26.860
 that's mean you hurt him and he doesn't wanna get hurt again.

40:26.860 --> 40:29.380
 So he's really trying to run away

40:29.380 --> 40:34.180
 and not winning the fight anymore, but not losing.

40:34.180 --> 40:36.740
 So sort of surviving the five round

40:36.740 --> 40:41.340
 and it's hard to finish a guy who doesn't wanna fight.

40:41.340 --> 40:43.700
 A guy who's not fighting anymore to win

40:43.700 --> 40:45.420
 and he's fighting to not lose.

40:45.420 --> 40:47.220
 And the proof of that, if you don't believe me,

40:47.220 --> 40:50.140
 just look the reign of all the greatest champion in UFC.

40:50.140 --> 40:54.220
 I don't care who they are, John Jones or like,

40:54.220 --> 40:56.580
 you could clearly see that in the beginning of their reign,

40:56.580 --> 40:59.260
 they could finish a lot of their opponents,

40:59.260 --> 41:02.060
 same as me in the beginning, I was finishing a lot of my opponent.

41:02.060 --> 41:06.020
 But there's a time that the entire UFC roster is studying you

41:06.860 --> 41:09.900
 and they found ways to perhaps not beating you,

41:09.900 --> 41:14.220
 but they found a way to navigate through the fight

41:14.220 --> 41:16.300
 in a way that they minimize the damage.

41:16.300 --> 41:17.140
 You know what I mean?

41:17.140 --> 41:19.700
 So it's a big difference between fighting to win

41:19.700 --> 41:21.140
 and fighting to not lose.

41:22.460 --> 41:23.940
 You said that there's a difference

41:23.940 --> 41:26.020
 between a fighter and a martial artist.

41:26.020 --> 41:28.340
 So now we were talking about fighting.

41:28.340 --> 41:30.180
 You're considered by many to be

41:30.180 --> 41:32.780
 one of the greatest fighters of all time,

41:32.780 --> 41:34.780
 but you've said that there's a difference

41:34.780 --> 41:37.820
 between a fighter and a martial artist.

41:37.820 --> 41:39.620
 A fighter is training for a purpose.

41:39.620 --> 41:40.620
 He has a fight.

41:42.540 --> 41:43.740
 I'm a martial artist.

41:43.740 --> 41:45.060
 I don't train for a fight.

41:45.060 --> 41:46.500
 I train for myself.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.060
 I'm training all the time.

41:48.060 --> 41:52.500
 My goal is perfection, but I will never reach perfection.

41:52.500 --> 41:55.940
 So what to you, does it mean to be a martial artist?

41:56.940 --> 41:59.980
 Martial artists is because that lifestyle

42:01.460 --> 42:03.540
 that I have has been introduced to me

42:03.540 --> 42:05.740
 and the seed has been planted to my mind

42:05.740 --> 42:08.580
 a long, long time ago by my father.

42:12.260 --> 42:15.100
 I do not train because I have a fight.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.220
 I will always train.

42:16.220 --> 42:20.260
 Even now, it kind of amused me to see that

42:21.780 --> 42:23.740
 a lot of people, because I'm still training,

42:23.740 --> 42:25.740
 because I love the science of fighting.

42:25.740 --> 42:28.180
 I do not like to fight, but I love the science of it.

42:28.180 --> 42:31.300
 And I will always do it as long as I can do it.

42:31.300 --> 42:34.140
 People think I'm gonna make a comeback and everything.

42:34.140 --> 42:37.060
 I'm about to get to have 40 years old, you know?

42:37.060 --> 42:40.180
 Like, it's, I'm, you know, like,

42:42.100 --> 42:44.820
 I don't wanna fight in a cage at 40 years old.

42:44.820 --> 42:47.340
 I mean, some people have done it and they did it very well,

42:47.340 --> 42:49.580
 but I'm not one of them.

42:49.580 --> 42:51.260
 I feel a little bit to me that,

42:52.820 --> 42:54.500
 and you never say never.

42:55.340 --> 42:56.780
 I feel like to me, like it's a little,

42:56.780 --> 42:58.860
 like a kid that you play with a strain when he's young,

42:58.860 --> 43:00.980
 like, then he's five years old,

43:00.980 --> 43:03.700
 but six years old, seven years old, eight years old.

43:03.700 --> 43:05.860
 And then I want to be like,

43:05.860 --> 43:08.140
 what the hell I'm doing here and I'm 12 for this.

43:08.140 --> 43:11.900
 Like, I have done it, you know?

43:11.900 --> 43:16.900
 And I got out of it on top and I'm healthy,

43:17.900 --> 43:20.020
 which is the most important thing right now.

43:20.020 --> 43:22.780
 I'm touching wood and I'm wealthy.

43:22.780 --> 43:24.380
 I beat the game, you know what I mean?

43:24.380 --> 43:27.260
 In a way, like, that's not to be cocky, but I did it.

43:27.260 --> 43:31.060
 And I wish more fighters could do the same thing.

43:31.060 --> 43:34.780
 I wish, but it's unfortunate because a lot of them,

43:34.780 --> 43:37.580
 they stay there and hang out for too long

43:37.580 --> 43:39.140
 and they get badly hurt.

43:39.140 --> 43:44.140
 They get beaten and broken, you know?

43:45.300 --> 43:47.380
 And they finish broke as well

43:47.380 --> 43:50.180
 because the lifestyle you have when you're a pro athlete,

43:50.180 --> 43:53.780
 it's crazy, you know, it's unbelievable.

43:53.780 --> 43:57.100
 However, everything that goes up in life goes down

43:57.100 --> 43:59.460
 and you need to plan your future, you know?

43:59.460 --> 44:04.060
 So for me, if some guys have the same mentality as me

44:04.060 --> 44:05.180
 and they're watching us right now,

44:05.180 --> 44:09.020
 I would say if you do it because you're just good at it,

44:09.020 --> 44:11.660
 you like the money, the advantage, the freedom

44:11.660 --> 44:14.740
 that it gives you, but you don't necessarily like to fight.

44:14.740 --> 44:17.540
 When you're done, you finish on top, you know?

44:17.540 --> 44:19.660
 Go cash out and get out of here.

44:19.660 --> 44:21.980
 Walk away, this is really hard to do.

44:21.980 --> 44:24.660
 However, Alex, it's not everybody that does it

44:24.660 --> 44:25.500
 for that reason.

44:25.500 --> 44:28.860
 Some people generally love to fight, love to compete.

44:28.860 --> 44:30.900
 So they do it because they love it, you know?

44:30.900 --> 44:32.420
 Or they do it because of the money.

44:32.420 --> 44:34.820
 But if you don't love it, if you don't like to fight

44:34.820 --> 44:36.980
 because it's very stressful and you don't enjoy,

44:36.980 --> 44:38.820
 you enjoy the training, perhaps,

44:38.820 --> 44:40.020
 or you don't like to fight, you do it

44:40.020 --> 44:42.340
 because it's part of what you need to do

44:42.340 --> 44:44.220
 in order to keep that lifestyle.

44:44.220 --> 44:48.100
 And, you know, like, you don't need the money.

44:48.100 --> 44:49.540
 Get out of here, man.

44:49.540 --> 44:51.700
 If you're in your prime, get out of here

44:51.700 --> 44:54.540
 because if you don't, you'll hurt your own legacy,

44:54.540 --> 44:56.420
 you'll damage your health.

44:56.420 --> 44:57.860
 It's very sad.

44:57.860 --> 45:02.340
 And it's a sad business, you know what I mean?

45:03.340 --> 45:07.740
 It's like a lot of, one of the places

45:07.740 --> 45:12.060
 where it's the most, one of the most happiest place

45:12.060 --> 45:15.260
 for me to go and the most saddest place for me to go,

45:15.260 --> 45:16.100
 it's in the gym.

45:16.100 --> 45:18.380
 It's a triceria in Montreal

45:18.380 --> 45:20.900
 because it's one of the happiest place for me to go

45:20.900 --> 45:23.660
 because I can go train and do what I love to do.

45:24.780 --> 45:26.460
 But it's also a very sad place for me

45:26.460 --> 45:28.500
 because after when I'm about to leave,

45:28.500 --> 45:31.060
 there's always a bunch of young kids that comes

45:31.060 --> 45:35.420
 or guys that are around 30, 33 years old

45:35.420 --> 45:36.260
 and they come to me and say,

45:36.260 --> 45:40.020
 George, you have some advice for me and I look at them.

45:41.540 --> 45:44.220
 And if they're my friend, they're a real close friend of mine,

45:44.220 --> 45:46.300
 I'll tell them the truth in their face

45:46.300 --> 45:49.580
 and I've done it many times and it was not well received.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.260
 But if they're not my friend, I have to, you know,

45:52.260 --> 45:53.620
 it's always an advice about fighting

45:53.620 --> 45:56.500
 and I answer their question, it's my pleasure.

45:56.500 --> 46:00.460
 But the truth, if they want me to tell the truth,

46:00.460 --> 46:03.420
 the big majority of them, I would tell them,

46:03.420 --> 46:08.420
 listen, man, you're on a losing street of three fights,

46:10.940 --> 46:14.260
 you're 33 years old, you know,

46:14.260 --> 46:16.940
 I think you should think about doing something else

46:16.940 --> 46:19.260
 in your life, you know, have other goals, you know,

46:19.260 --> 46:21.220
 because you're not gonna make it.

46:21.220 --> 46:24.420
 And, you know, I've seen that movie before

46:24.420 --> 46:26.580
 and it's a very sad ending.

46:26.580 --> 46:29.060
 And I'm sad to tell you the truth

46:29.060 --> 46:31.180
 because you're not gonna make the money,

46:31.180 --> 46:33.780
 just choose something, but if I tell them that,

46:33.780 --> 46:35.580
 they're gonna be angry at me because they're gonna be like,

46:35.580 --> 46:37.780
 oh, you, you make it and you think I cannot make it.

46:37.780 --> 46:40.340
 So it's kind of, they're gonna think I'm cocky,

46:40.340 --> 46:41.980
 but I was lucky to make it.

46:41.980 --> 46:43.620
 You know what, the star were all aligned,

46:43.620 --> 46:47.380
 but at one point you need to be able to have a plan B,

46:47.380 --> 46:49.420
 you know, like some parent,

46:49.420 --> 46:52.420
 they come to see me with their kids.

46:52.420 --> 46:55.980
 Hey, this is the future world champion in the UFC

46:55.980 --> 46:57.980
 and what advice would you give him?

46:57.980 --> 46:59.460
 I always tell the same thing

46:59.460 --> 47:01.780
 and it does not make everybody happy when I say,

47:01.780 --> 47:05.660
 I say, I go to the car and say, are you good at school?

47:05.660 --> 47:06.780
 Say, stay at school.

47:06.780 --> 47:08.420
 School is very important for you.

47:08.420 --> 47:10.020
 Stay educated.

47:10.020 --> 47:14.340
 Yeah, do boxing, martial arts, a great sport, stay in shape,

47:14.340 --> 47:17.260
 but don't put your eggs all in the same basket.

47:17.260 --> 47:18.820
 And the parents sometimes are angry when I say,

47:18.820 --> 47:20.340
 not angry, but I can see in their eyes,

47:20.340 --> 47:24.420
 they're like, they kind of surprised.

47:24.420 --> 47:27.180
 And it's not because I made it

47:27.180 --> 47:31.220
 that I will tell their kid to follow the same path that I did.

47:31.220 --> 47:34.260
 I went to school too, I've studied.

47:34.260 --> 47:35.700
 I dropped off school

47:35.700 --> 47:39.300
 when I had my first world championship fight against Matt Hughes.

47:39.300 --> 47:41.420
 But before that, I was in school.

47:41.420 --> 47:45.340
 So I had another way to go

47:45.340 --> 47:48.860
 if things would not have gone the way I wanted.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.140
 But the problem, and I'm saying that,

47:51.140 --> 47:52.900
 it's not only about boxing and MMA,

47:52.900 --> 47:56.460
 I'm talking about hockey, basketball, baseball, same thing.

47:56.460 --> 47:59.740
 Maybe it's the one on 100,000 that make it.

47:59.740 --> 48:01.860
 And I'm saying that make it.

48:01.860 --> 48:03.780
 When I'm saying I make it, that's mean

48:03.780 --> 48:05.900
 that can retire and have enough money

48:05.900 --> 48:07.060
 for the rest of his life.

48:07.060 --> 48:09.660
 Because it's a sad story.

48:09.660 --> 48:12.860
 People only heard about the people that makes it.

48:12.860 --> 48:16.340
 But a lot of fighters, even a UFC champion,

48:16.340 --> 48:18.500
 in boxing champion, even in football, basketball,

48:18.500 --> 48:20.460
 I don't care the big names.

48:20.460 --> 48:22.020
 When they retire, they have zero.

48:22.020 --> 48:23.860
 They're bankrupt, my friend.

48:23.860 --> 48:27.500
 And it's a very sad story and a sad reality

48:27.500 --> 48:29.500
 that most people are not aware of.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.660
 But having other paths in life, actually,

48:31.660 --> 48:36.340
 can also increase the chance of you dominating

48:36.340 --> 48:39.740
 and reaching the highest peak in your main thing.

48:39.740 --> 48:41.580
 I mean, Jimmy Page, I don't know if you know who that is,

48:41.580 --> 48:44.900
 is a judo coach in America.

48:44.900 --> 48:47.820
 He says that to all of his athletes,

48:47.820 --> 48:49.380
 just to make sure that you go.

48:49.380 --> 48:51.500
 He has a lot of Kayla Harrison,

48:51.500 --> 48:52.780
 two time Olympic gold medalist.

48:52.780 --> 48:55.100
 He has a lot of Olympic medalists.

48:55.100 --> 48:57.380
 But basically, there's something about going to school,

48:57.380 --> 48:59.220
 like having, if I forget school,

48:59.220 --> 49:01.940
 any other avenue in life

49:01.940 --> 49:06.340
 that gives you the freedom to go all out in your main.

49:06.340 --> 49:09.340
 Like, you know you're doing it for the right reasons.

49:09.340 --> 49:10.900
 You're not stuck.

49:10.900 --> 49:13.500
 It clears the mind to where you're free

49:13.500 --> 49:15.580
 to be the best in the world,

49:15.580 --> 49:18.580
 as opposed to kind of you have to.

49:18.580 --> 49:21.260
 I mean, different people are motivated by different things.

49:21.260 --> 49:25.220
 So sometimes some people like having their back to the wall,

49:25.220 --> 49:26.700
 and that's the only option they have.

49:26.700 --> 49:30.420
 But most people, I think, excel when you have other options.

49:30.420 --> 49:31.860
 I think it's a distraction,

49:31.860 --> 49:35.020
 and I think it's important to have a distraction.

49:35.020 --> 49:38.660
 When you say that, I think about one of my coach, John Danagher.

49:38.660 --> 49:43.700
 He put his academic background experience into Jiu Jitsu.

49:43.700 --> 49:46.940
 And for me, that's why he's the best teacher I ever had.

49:46.940 --> 49:49.500
 He's incredible.

49:49.500 --> 49:52.300
 He started teaching me

49:52.300 --> 49:54.780
 when I even couldn't speak much English at the time.

49:54.780 --> 49:58.300
 And I was able to communicate and understand,

49:58.300 --> 50:00.580
 you know, that's how good he is.

50:00.580 --> 50:03.460
 But I truly believe that most of athletes,

50:03.460 --> 50:06.820
 especially in sport like mixed martial art,

50:06.820 --> 50:08.380
 train way too much.

50:08.380 --> 50:11.900
 If I could go back and talk to a young George,

50:11.900 --> 50:16.580
 I would tell him, say, you do way too much volume.

50:16.580 --> 50:17.940
 You train way too hard.

50:17.940 --> 50:20.660
 Train smarter, it's more important.

50:20.660 --> 50:23.700
 And I think sometimes we underestimate

50:23.700 --> 50:27.220
 the benefit of recuperation.

50:27.220 --> 50:31.020
 Because I think we assimilate the information

50:31.020 --> 50:35.380
 that we learn during a training when we recuperate,

50:35.380 --> 50:37.660
 and not during the training itself.

50:37.660 --> 50:42.340
 And this whole mentality of harder, heavier, you know,

50:42.340 --> 50:47.020
 like it's good for someone who's lazy.

50:47.020 --> 50:49.460
 But if you're an elite athlete, most of the time,

50:49.460 --> 50:52.100
 you know, like you're not always, but most of the time,

50:52.100 --> 50:54.660
 it's because you're not lazy.

50:54.660 --> 50:58.940
 And a lot of guys, sometimes they're elite athletes,

50:58.940 --> 51:01.740
 champions, and you hear people say,

51:01.740 --> 51:04.900
 oh, I can't believe he's very gifted, but he doesn't work.

51:04.900 --> 51:07.740
 But perhaps it's not really because,

51:07.740 --> 51:09.420
 perhaps it's because we don't understand.

51:09.420 --> 51:10.900
 Perhaps he's doing the right thing,

51:10.900 --> 51:14.860
 and it's us who's working too much and too hard.

51:14.860 --> 51:16.900
 That's what I think.

51:16.900 --> 51:21.540
 There's a guy I train with, he made me think about it.

51:21.540 --> 51:23.700
 His name is Mansur Barnawi.

51:23.700 --> 51:25.980
 He's going to be a future star.

51:25.980 --> 51:27.940
 He's an incredible fighter.

51:27.940 --> 51:31.060
 He trained once a day.

51:31.060 --> 51:32.460
 And he asked me some time to advise

51:32.460 --> 51:33.980
 when he came to Montreal, he's from France.

51:33.980 --> 51:37.660
 You'll hear about him, he's very good.

51:37.660 --> 51:41.220
 And I saw him in the morning at TriStar.

51:41.220 --> 51:42.980
 And I said, OK, I'll see you perhaps later

51:42.980 --> 51:43.860
 in the other training zone.

51:43.860 --> 51:46.500
 No, I only train once a day.

51:46.500 --> 51:50.420
 And he kind of waits for me to give him like,

51:50.420 --> 51:54.900
 not an approval, but to see how I react.

51:54.900 --> 51:57.940
 Or I don't know, it was kind of a strange feeling.

51:57.940 --> 51:59.900
 But I told myself, at that point,

51:59.900 --> 52:06.220
 I kind of had an awakening, and I told myself, man,

52:06.220 --> 52:08.300
 maybe he's doing the right thing.

52:08.300 --> 52:10.740
 Because a lot of people would say, for example, oh,

52:10.740 --> 52:13.100
 that's a lazy way of doing it.

52:13.100 --> 52:15.660
 But perhaps it's the best way to do it.

52:15.660 --> 52:17.380
 I'm not saying that training once a day

52:17.380 --> 52:18.500
 is the best way to do it.

52:18.500 --> 52:19.420
 That's what I'm saying.

52:19.420 --> 52:22.780
 I'm saying that everybody is different.

52:22.780 --> 52:25.980
 But for him, it works beautifully.

52:25.980 --> 52:29.780
 And I wouldn't change anything if I would be him,

52:29.780 --> 52:33.900
 because he's improving like crazy.

52:33.900 --> 52:36.300
 Yeah, and ultimately, the bigger picture there

52:36.300 --> 52:40.420
 is to do something that everyone else says is stupid.

52:40.420 --> 52:43.620
 It's like the fasting thing, that a lot of people

52:43.620 --> 52:45.940
 would say, a lot of nutritional experts would say

52:45.940 --> 52:48.740
 that that's a dumb way.

52:48.740 --> 52:50.460
 If you want to be an MMA fighter,

52:50.460 --> 52:52.620
 you should be eating like many times a day.

52:52.620 --> 52:55.100
 You should be starting every day with oatmeal.

52:55.100 --> 52:57.460
 You should be carving up constantly.

52:57.460 --> 52:59.860
 But that's not necessarily true for everybody.

52:59.860 --> 53:01.220
 And it's possible.

53:01.220 --> 53:03.180
 I'm sure there's actually now a few MMA fighters

53:03.180 --> 53:04.260
 that are carnivore only.

53:04.260 --> 53:05.460
 It's possible.

53:05.460 --> 53:08.700
 I used to eat right before training,

53:08.700 --> 53:11.980
 and it didn't bother me.

53:11.980 --> 53:17.940
 However, now, my first training that I do normally,

53:17.940 --> 53:24.020
 in average, around noon, 11 AM, I haven't

53:24.020 --> 53:25.940
 eaten anything when I do my first training.

53:25.940 --> 53:32.300
 And it feels to me that I'm much more clear in my mind.

53:32.300 --> 53:33.900
 I'm much more creative.

53:33.900 --> 53:35.500
 I feel better.

53:35.500 --> 53:37.060
 Yeah, it's a big difference.

53:37.060 --> 53:39.500
 I just wish I would have known that before.

53:39.500 --> 53:41.980
 Well, it's fascinating, the role of the mind in all of this,

53:41.980 --> 53:45.740
 how important is it for your mind to be clear,

53:45.740 --> 53:48.300
 to really think deeply?

53:48.300 --> 53:54.020
 There's a judoka American named Travis Stevens.

53:54.020 --> 53:59.940
 I remember he said something that the right kind of practice

53:59.940 --> 54:03.420
 is when your mind is exhausted at the end of it,

54:03.420 --> 54:07.660
 that you were constantly thinking through things.

54:07.660 --> 54:09.700
 Like, your body shouldn't be exhausted first.

54:09.700 --> 54:11.980
 Your mind should be exhausted first.

54:11.980 --> 54:13.300
 It's really fascinating.

54:13.300 --> 54:17.140
 So people think about training hard.

54:17.140 --> 54:21.500
 A successful practice is where you walk away just overwhelmed

54:21.500 --> 54:23.660
 how much you had to think.

54:23.660 --> 54:27.300
 It's a fascinating framing of a successful practice.

54:27.300 --> 54:28.300
 It's true.

54:28.300 --> 54:31.340
 Travis Stevens was one of my main training partners

54:31.340 --> 54:36.220
 when I got ready for my fight with Nick Diaz and Carlos

54:36.220 --> 54:38.060
 Condit.

54:38.060 --> 54:44.540
 He drove every Friday from, I believe, Boston.

54:44.540 --> 54:47.220
 It's like a six hour drive.

54:47.220 --> 54:50.740
 Drive to the gym in Montreal.

54:50.740 --> 54:54.460
 Train with us an hour and a half.

54:54.460 --> 54:55.460
 Drive back.

54:58.300 --> 55:01.340
 He's got such an amazing discipline.

55:01.340 --> 55:05.140
 I was so happy for him when he won the medal at the Olympic

55:05.140 --> 55:05.900
 game.

55:05.900 --> 55:12.420
 Man, what a well deserved accomplishment.

55:12.420 --> 55:13.580
 It's unbelievable.

55:13.580 --> 55:15.100
 It paid off.

55:15.100 --> 55:16.540
 I was so happy for him.

55:16.540 --> 55:20.540
 And every time we got to the gym,

55:20.540 --> 55:26.140
 he was waiting for me in the kneeling position like a soldier.

55:26.140 --> 55:31.060
 I was like, my god, this guy is made of steel.

55:31.060 --> 55:33.620
 And after training, I always offer him.

55:33.620 --> 55:36.340
 And I say, hey, Travis, I know you like to train with that.

55:36.340 --> 55:38.420
 Because in Montreal, they have a very good judo team,

55:38.420 --> 55:41.500
 Nicolas Gill and all those guys.

55:41.500 --> 55:44.780
 And I say, if you want to stay, I'll get you at the hotel.

55:44.780 --> 55:46.660
 Anything you want is like, no, no, I got to go back.

55:46.660 --> 55:48.100
 I got another training later.

55:48.100 --> 55:50.620
 I'm like, not only did he train with us,

55:50.620 --> 55:53.220
 you have to go back because he had another training.

55:53.220 --> 55:55.340
 I'm like, this is insane.

55:55.340 --> 55:57.780
 And he's gone through a huge number of injuries.

55:57.780 --> 56:01.980
 So he's also an innovator because, I mean,

56:01.980 --> 56:04.060
 it's difficult to say, but for American judo,

56:04.060 --> 56:06.700
 there's not many high level judoka.

56:06.700 --> 56:10.660
 So if you want to fight with the best in the world,

56:10.660 --> 56:12.660
 you have to be alone.

56:12.660 --> 56:14.540
 It's a lonely journey, actually.

56:14.540 --> 56:16.580
 It's kind of sad.

56:16.580 --> 56:19.780
 It's much easier to be in Japan where everybody's a killer.

56:19.780 --> 56:23.180
 When you're alone at it, it's a difficult journey.

56:23.180 --> 56:28.180
 And it's funny we talked about there's some sports

56:28.180 --> 56:32.740
 where a mistake is that's it.

56:32.740 --> 56:34.620
 You can't recover from a mistake.

56:34.620 --> 56:37.420
 I think judo oftentimes is one of those sports.

56:37.420 --> 56:44.020
 And added on top of that is the Olympics, only every four

56:44.020 --> 56:45.220
 years.

56:45.220 --> 56:49.420
 And Travis's story, he's the reason when I saw him in 2008

56:49.420 --> 56:51.660
 is I started martial arts.

56:51.660 --> 56:55.780
 I switched from wrestling and street fighting

56:55.780 --> 56:58.180
 to doing jiu jitsu and judo.

56:58.180 --> 56:59.940
 And I just saw so much guts.

56:59.940 --> 57:03.860
 And in 2000, I might be messing up the years here,

57:03.860 --> 57:07.460
 but in the next Olympics, he fought.

57:07.460 --> 57:11.900
 And he lost on just the referee call.

57:11.900 --> 57:13.340
 And just he went to war.

57:13.340 --> 57:18.660
 And he just so much guts and just everything on the line

57:18.660 --> 57:19.780
 and to lose.

57:19.780 --> 57:22.140
 And then to still persevere through all the injuries,

57:22.140 --> 57:24.860
 through all of that, through incredibly difficult training

57:24.860 --> 57:28.100
 sessions to go another four years and then compete

57:28.100 --> 57:29.260
 and then win a medal.

57:29.260 --> 57:33.100
 I mean, that guy's just and like he clearly

57:33.100 --> 57:35.220
 could have been very successful.

57:35.220 --> 57:37.460
 He's also an incredible jiu jitsu competitor.

57:37.460 --> 57:40.780
 So he could have switched to that, but he's stuck.

57:40.780 --> 57:47.300
 In a lot of sport, when you're an elite, like for example,

57:47.300 --> 57:52.220
 in Canada, I saw keys, the number one sport of the country.

57:52.220 --> 57:54.420
 Kids, when they're an elite, when they're young,

57:54.420 --> 57:56.020
 they get chosen.

57:56.020 --> 58:02.060
 And they're kind of already known as a superstar.

58:02.060 --> 58:05.220
 The school where they go and the program they follow,

58:05.220 --> 58:07.780
 like I'm sure it's the same thing in the US, in basketball,

58:07.780 --> 58:11.780
 baseball, perhaps American football,

58:11.780 --> 58:13.900
 because they already chosen.

58:13.900 --> 58:17.180
 So they grew up with that, that it's

58:17.180 --> 58:21.540
 a kid that superstar, a stardom, so to speak.

58:21.540 --> 58:26.220
 And it's already sort of glamorous, you know?

58:26.220 --> 58:32.260
 However, in MMA, there's no MMA, judo, wrestling.

58:32.260 --> 58:34.940
 Like in America, because it's not our national sport,

58:34.940 --> 58:38.820
 it's actually it's not like even when I first started,

58:38.820 --> 58:42.460
 it was not really well received by the media.

58:42.460 --> 58:45.180
 There's no glamour into it.

58:45.180 --> 58:46.060
 Now I don't know.

58:46.060 --> 58:48.580
 It seems like it's another era now.

58:48.580 --> 58:52.660
 And I feel sometimes that some people

58:52.660 --> 58:54.940
 do it for the wrong reason.

58:54.940 --> 58:58.380
 You know, some people do it because of the glamour,

58:58.380 --> 58:59.940
 because of the money.

58:59.940 --> 59:02.740
 But even if you're an elite and very good,

59:02.740 --> 59:07.420
 the glamour and the money won't come in the beginning.

59:07.420 --> 59:13.540
 It's a very long grind before it starts to come in.

59:13.540 --> 59:16.020
 And you need to make those sacrifices.

59:16.020 --> 59:19.860
 And it's a journey that where you will be tested,

59:19.860 --> 59:23.580
 you will be hurt, repeatedly, and you're

59:23.580 --> 59:28.780
 going to have to reach the down deep and come back up.

59:28.780 --> 59:31.340
 And then once you finally think you made it,

59:31.340 --> 59:33.500
 you're going to go back in the down deep again.

59:33.500 --> 59:39.700
 It's a very exhausting and encouraging adventure sometimes.

59:39.700 --> 59:42.500
 But if you hold on to your dream and you believe in it,

59:42.500 --> 59:47.460
 and you have the stars are aligned, you're going to make it.

59:47.460 --> 59:50.980
 That's why it's only a few people that make it.

59:50.980 --> 59:55.500
 And that's why I feel sometimes a lot of people

59:55.500 --> 59:58.060
 in the new generation do it for the wrong reason.

59:58.060 --> 1:00:00.460
 In my generation, because of sport,

1:00:00.460 --> 1:00:03.460
 at first there were no rules.

1:00:03.460 --> 1:00:04.780
 I thought it was more pure.

1:00:04.780 --> 1:00:07.660
 The people that did it was really because of the passion.

1:00:07.660 --> 1:00:11.740
 We didn't seek money, fame.

1:00:11.740 --> 1:00:13.940
 We did it because we wanted to be.

1:00:13.940 --> 1:00:16.580
 I did it because I wanted to be the man.

1:00:16.580 --> 1:00:19.020
 I like to have the confidence that when

1:00:19.020 --> 1:00:21.580
 I walk somewhere, I have the confidence

1:00:21.580 --> 1:00:24.620
 that it's an illusion because nobody is faster than a bullet.

1:00:24.620 --> 1:00:25.940
 Yes.

1:00:25.940 --> 1:00:28.740
 But I wanted to achieve it for myself.

1:00:28.740 --> 1:00:32.140
 And which today now, because I don't

1:00:32.140 --> 1:00:35.380
 know if it's social media and all that,

1:00:35.380 --> 1:00:39.260
 the world has changed, the glamour.

1:00:39.260 --> 1:00:42.740
 I feel it's a different thing right now.

1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:43.740
 Yeah.

1:00:43.740 --> 1:00:45.660
 If you get in it for the glamour or the money,

1:00:45.660 --> 1:00:48.580
 you may not have the right amount of fuel

1:00:48.580 --> 1:00:51.860
 to persevere through all the ups and downs, for sure.

1:00:51.860 --> 1:00:58.780
 When you talk about motivation of money and glamour,

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:01.660
 a guy comes to mind, and I don't know how many wrestlers

1:01:01.660 --> 1:01:05.580
 you know, but in Russia, there's a guy

1:01:05.580 --> 1:01:09.740
 named Bovasya Satyev, the Satyev brothers,

1:01:09.740 --> 1:01:12.940
 one of the greatest freestyle wrestlers of all time.

1:01:12.940 --> 1:01:17.140
 But he also has, it's funny, he doesn't have many interviews.

1:01:17.140 --> 1:01:19.620
 One of my goals is to go out and talk to him in Russian,

1:01:19.620 --> 1:01:20.900
 do an interview with him.

1:01:20.900 --> 1:01:24.500
 Because he's exceptionally poetic and a deep thinker.

1:01:24.500 --> 1:01:27.740
 He's the kind of martial artist that you are in the way

1:01:27.740 --> 1:01:30.220
 that it's not just about the different battles you've

1:01:30.220 --> 1:01:31.700
 been through or whatever.

1:01:31.700 --> 1:01:35.540
 It's about the philosophy behind the way he approaches life.

1:01:35.540 --> 1:01:39.500
 Now, he has spoken quite a bit about that the glamour,

1:01:39.500 --> 1:01:41.500
 the fame, the money are all things

1:01:41.500 --> 1:01:47.100
 that get in the way of the purity of the experience,

1:01:47.100 --> 1:01:50.060
 the art, that the way to achieve greatness

1:01:50.060 --> 1:01:56.340
 is to just lose yourself in the art of the actual combat.

1:01:56.340 --> 1:01:58.500
 In his case, it's wrestling.

1:01:58.500 --> 1:02:02.700
 And then kind of not to worry and actively make sure

1:02:02.700 --> 1:02:07.700
 that you block out anybody who feeds you

1:02:07.700 --> 1:02:09.140
 the narrative where you're supposed

1:02:09.140 --> 1:02:12.100
 to be this famous person and all those kinds of things

1:02:12.100 --> 1:02:16.620
 that he basically says, let others write your story.

1:02:16.620 --> 1:02:19.140
 Make sure that you just focus on the art.

1:02:19.140 --> 1:02:21.900
 And another person from that side of the world

1:02:21.900 --> 1:02:24.060
 is, of course, Khabib.

1:02:24.060 --> 1:02:26.380
 So he represents that side of the world.

1:02:26.380 --> 1:02:28.820
 And we were talking about walking away.

1:02:28.820 --> 1:02:33.260
 And most people not being able to walk away at the top

1:02:33.260 --> 1:02:38.460
 as you have, but also now Khabib has, it looks like,

1:02:38.460 --> 1:02:39.420
 incredibly so.

1:02:39.420 --> 1:02:43.180
 So maybe you can comment about what your thoughts are

1:02:43.180 --> 1:02:45.460
 about Khabib numbering him out of being

1:02:45.460 --> 1:02:47.860
 able to just walk away.

1:02:47.860 --> 1:02:50.260
 We talk about the gold very often.

1:02:50.260 --> 1:02:54.740
 Khabib isn't the argument because he

1:02:54.740 --> 1:03:01.180
 has the most dominant carrier of all martial art, the guy.

1:03:01.180 --> 1:03:03.820
 Some guys can be named the gold for different reasons,

1:03:03.820 --> 1:03:07.820
 but Khabib, for that reason, and he's undefeated,

1:03:07.820 --> 1:03:10.260
 I don't even know if he lost.

1:03:10.260 --> 1:03:15.340
 He might have lost round, but he dominates all his opponent.

1:03:15.340 --> 1:03:17.340
 It was ridiculous.

1:03:17.340 --> 1:03:22.300
 And such an incredible carrier that he had.

1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:27.140
 I love to watch him fight, he's incredible.

1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:29.220
 And when you talk about the art, when

1:03:29.220 --> 1:03:34.500
 you say mixed martial art, the idea

1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:39.300
 of a flawless performance for me,

1:03:39.300 --> 1:03:42.820
 everybody often, when we say flawless performance,

1:03:42.820 --> 1:03:46.900
 thinks about a knockout, a brutal knockout.

1:03:46.900 --> 1:03:53.740
 But for me, it's to be able to showcase beautiful technique,

1:03:53.740 --> 1:03:56.700
 like a beautiful takedown, beautiful submission,

1:03:56.700 --> 1:04:02.300
 like something beautiful that you know when you look at,

1:04:02.300 --> 1:04:07.780
 for example, Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan,

1:04:07.780 --> 1:04:11.700
 or like Stephen Curry.

1:04:11.700 --> 1:04:14.260
 Even if you don't know nothing about basketball

1:04:14.260 --> 1:04:17.380
 and you watch Michael Jordan, you'll be like, wow,

1:04:17.380 --> 1:04:19.660
 that's beautiful what you just did.

1:04:19.660 --> 1:04:22.180
 Like we talk about fighting and trying

1:04:22.180 --> 1:04:26.100
 to say the word beautiful in fighting for certain people,

1:04:26.100 --> 1:04:28.900
 it could sound kind of crazy, but I'm

1:04:28.900 --> 1:04:33.700
 talking about the technique, a beautiful technique.

1:04:33.700 --> 1:04:35.540
 For me, that's the goal.

1:04:35.540 --> 1:04:38.460
 When I was fighting, it's not only to have a brutal knockout,

1:04:38.460 --> 1:04:41.260
 because some people are more gifted than others.

1:04:41.260 --> 1:04:43.300
 I'm saying gifted, some people are better than others

1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:46.060
 in certain phase of fighting.

1:04:46.060 --> 1:04:49.300
 But for me, it was that it was to showcase, to win, of course,

1:04:49.300 --> 1:04:52.380
 but to showcase some beautiful technique

1:04:52.380 --> 1:04:56.500
 that you can watch it and be like, wow, that was incredible.

1:04:56.500 --> 1:04:58.740
 The timing, he did it.

1:04:58.740 --> 1:05:03.340
 And when I think about Khabib Nurmagomedov,

1:05:03.340 --> 1:05:06.700
 I see all the detail of his work, especially when

1:05:06.700 --> 1:05:08.820
 he's got his opponent against the fence,

1:05:08.820 --> 1:05:12.700
 that's his area of expertise where he's, to me,

1:05:12.700 --> 1:05:15.140
 he's the best that ever did it.

1:05:15.140 --> 1:05:20.300
 In terms of that fighting style, that particular expertise

1:05:20.300 --> 1:05:22.060
 that he has, it's just incredible.

1:05:22.060 --> 1:05:25.420
 The flawless execution of that particular set of techniques.

1:05:25.420 --> 1:05:26.020
 Yeah.

1:05:26.020 --> 1:05:31.300
 And Conor McGregor had the accuracy.

1:05:31.300 --> 1:05:35.180
 The spider, Anderson Silva, was, I would say,

1:05:35.180 --> 1:05:37.780
 the most flamboyant of all.

1:05:37.780 --> 1:05:39.980
 He was moving like the Matrix.

1:05:39.980 --> 1:05:42.980
 John Jones was incredible in terms of creativity,

1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:44.540
 spinning elbows and that.

1:05:44.540 --> 1:05:48.620
 And he faced incredible adversity.

1:05:48.620 --> 1:05:51.700
 Dimitrius Johnson was so complete.

1:05:51.700 --> 1:05:54.900
 You could bring, he was slamming a guy to an arm bar.

1:05:54.900 --> 1:05:56.500
 It was just unbelievable.

1:05:56.500 --> 1:05:59.660
 He was like the complete fighter.

1:05:59.660 --> 1:06:02.180
 BJ Penn was so flexible.

1:06:02.180 --> 1:06:06.260
 He did stuff with his body that nobody could do.

1:06:06.260 --> 1:06:10.340
 The dexterity of his hips was just unbelievable.

1:06:10.340 --> 1:06:12.540
 Dominic Cruz, to me, was incredible.

1:06:12.540 --> 1:06:15.740
 His footwork, his distance control.

1:06:15.740 --> 1:06:19.460
 So when you talk about the goat, Royce Gracie, another one,

1:06:19.460 --> 1:06:21.740
 he did things that I think, for me, is not number one.

1:06:21.740 --> 1:06:23.900
 Yeah, I got to end, starting to interrupt.

1:06:23.900 --> 1:06:25.220
 The hoist is a fascinating one.

1:06:25.220 --> 1:06:26.820
 I'd love to hear what you think about him.

1:06:26.820 --> 1:06:31.380
 But many people consider you, most people,

1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:35.020
 consider you to be the number one greatest

1:06:35.020 --> 1:06:38.060
 mixed martial arts fighter ever.

1:06:38.060 --> 1:06:41.420
 So it's fascinating to remove you from that list

1:06:41.420 --> 1:06:44.140
 and continue this discussion and asking,

1:06:44.140 --> 1:06:46.500
 like, who do you think is the greatest fighter ever?

1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:48.300
 You listed some amazing ones.

1:06:48.300 --> 1:06:51.180
 Royce, you somehow skipped Fedor.

1:06:51.180 --> 1:06:53.300
 I'm very, as a Russian, I'm very offended.

1:06:53.300 --> 1:06:55.700
 No, I was going to, there's so many.

1:06:55.700 --> 1:06:57.260
 Fedor is one as well.

1:06:57.260 --> 1:06:59.700
 Fedor, I think, in his prime was like,

1:06:59.700 --> 1:07:02.580
 when you say, when you talk about a name, for example,

1:07:02.580 --> 1:07:07.100
 like, we talk about him when he was in his prime.

1:07:07.100 --> 1:07:09.260
 Like, when I talk, for example, about Anderson Silva,

1:07:09.260 --> 1:07:10.780
 I'm not talking about the Anderson Silva

1:07:10.780 --> 1:07:14.540
 who fought his last fight against Ray Yohal.

1:07:14.540 --> 1:07:17.660
 I'm talking about Anderson Silva who knocked out Victor Belfer.

1:07:17.660 --> 1:07:18.820
 Yes.

1:07:18.820 --> 1:07:21.180
 BJP and the same thing.

1:07:21.180 --> 1:07:25.220
 The problem is when fighters hang on for too long in the sport.

1:07:25.220 --> 1:07:26.060
 That's what happened.

1:07:26.060 --> 1:07:32.140
 They kind of make people forget how good they were.

1:07:32.140 --> 1:07:33.060
 And it's very sad.

1:07:33.060 --> 1:07:37.900
 We talk about Fedor and just think about steeping Mio Chich.

1:07:37.900 --> 1:07:41.020
 Mio Chich is probably the greatest heavyweight of all time,

1:07:41.020 --> 1:07:42.340
 with Fedor.

1:07:42.340 --> 1:07:45.380
 I would really wonder who would have won this fight,

1:07:45.380 --> 1:07:47.780
 the both guys in their prime.

1:07:47.780 --> 1:07:51.220
 I tend to lean towards Fedor because my heart was with Fedor.

1:07:51.220 --> 1:07:52.860
 Fedor, but he could have gone the other way.

1:07:52.860 --> 1:07:55.980
 But just because Mio Chich loses his last fight now,

1:07:55.980 --> 1:07:58.740
 everybody is like, oh, yeah, they forgot about him.

1:07:58.740 --> 1:08:00.180
 It's crazy, man.

1:08:00.180 --> 1:08:04.420
 It's one fight, you zig when you should zag, boom.

1:08:04.420 --> 1:08:06.580
 That's the reality of mixed martial arts.

1:08:06.580 --> 1:08:10.580
 Well, that's why the thing is the mixed martial arts

1:08:10.580 --> 1:08:14.300
 isn't just the performance, the strictly who won and who lost.

1:08:14.300 --> 1:08:16.500
 It's also the stories we tell ourselves.

1:08:16.500 --> 1:08:20.100
 And so, I mean, there's beautiful stories being weaved.

1:08:20.100 --> 1:08:24.300
 And that also is part of who is the greatest of all time.

1:08:24.300 --> 1:08:26.940
 Is what were the battles?

1:08:26.940 --> 1:08:29.580
 What had to be overcome?

1:08:29.580 --> 1:08:35.500
 What was the flavor of the flawless performances?

1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:37.860
 All of that plays into it.

1:08:37.860 --> 1:08:40.580
 And you're right, being able to walk away at the top

1:08:40.580 --> 1:08:42.340
 is also part of that.

1:08:42.340 --> 1:08:45.020
 A lot of people ask me about Khabib.

1:08:45.020 --> 1:08:49.940
 And that fight, I want it to happen.

1:08:49.940 --> 1:08:53.620
 Khabib wanted to happen, but UFC did not want to happen.

1:08:53.620 --> 1:08:54.700
 Between you and Khabib.

1:08:54.700 --> 1:08:55.540
 Yes.

1:08:55.540 --> 1:08:58.260
 And we tried to make it about three years ago

1:08:58.260 --> 1:09:00.580
 when I retired, no, three.

1:09:00.580 --> 1:09:03.260
 No, it was after two years ago.

1:09:03.260 --> 1:09:05.900
 And it never came to fruition.

1:09:05.900 --> 1:09:07.020
 The UFC were clear.

1:09:07.020 --> 1:09:09.420
 They said they have other plans for Khabib.

1:09:09.420 --> 1:09:12.180
 And it makes sense for the business standpoint

1:09:12.180 --> 1:09:15.540
 because they want to keep the ball rolling.

1:09:15.540 --> 1:09:16.620
 Now Khabib retired.

1:09:16.620 --> 1:09:20.020
 And like everybody else, after Justin Gay tree,

1:09:20.020 --> 1:09:23.020
 I was doing the commentator in French for the UFC.

1:09:23.020 --> 1:09:24.180
 And I had butterflies.

1:09:24.180 --> 1:09:26.860
 I thought he was going to call me out.

1:09:26.860 --> 1:09:28.980
 If there's one guy that I would have said yes,

1:09:28.980 --> 1:09:30.940
 it would be him because for a fighter,

1:09:30.940 --> 1:09:36.900
 the most exciting things to do, it's often the scariest one.

1:09:36.900 --> 1:09:39.020
 And Khabib was worth the risk.

1:09:39.020 --> 1:09:40.380
 He's the scariest match up for you?

1:09:40.380 --> 1:09:41.820
 Yes.

1:09:41.820 --> 1:09:44.700
 He was worth the risk because nobody

1:09:44.700 --> 1:09:47.580
 have ever been able to solve them.

1:09:47.580 --> 1:09:49.180
 How would you solve the Khabib,

1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:50.700
 never again, matter of puzzle?

1:09:50.700 --> 1:09:53.820
 Well, Khabib is very good against the fans.

1:09:53.820 --> 1:09:56.220
 I would have to establish a game plan and everything.

1:09:56.220 --> 1:10:00.500
 But I think what I would need it to do

1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:03.220
 is take the center of the octagon right away.

1:10:03.220 --> 1:10:05.500
 Use a lot of think and faith.

1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:09.580
 Keep the fight all the way out or all the way in.

1:10:09.580 --> 1:10:11.860
 And when I say all the way in is when you close the gap,

1:10:11.860 --> 1:10:14.180
 use my proactive and reactive takedown

1:10:14.180 --> 1:10:17.900
 and perhaps my superior explosivity to put him down.

1:10:17.900 --> 1:10:21.940
 I like to use those proactive and reactive techniques

1:10:21.940 --> 1:10:25.060
 because for me, I feel it's more economical.

1:10:25.060 --> 1:10:28.260
 Khabib is a much better chain wrestler than me.

1:10:28.260 --> 1:10:30.620
 Chain wrestler is when you get the guys to the fans,

1:10:30.620 --> 1:10:31.940
 it's pure wrestling.

1:10:31.940 --> 1:10:34.940
 What makes my takedown very efficient?

1:10:34.940 --> 1:10:35.940
 It's my karate.

1:10:35.940 --> 1:10:37.940
 It's not my wrestling.

1:10:37.940 --> 1:10:43.940
 I'm very good at timing my opponent and getting in

1:10:43.940 --> 1:10:45.940
 with my explosivity.

1:10:45.940 --> 1:10:49.460
 So if you watch at my takedown, it does not demand often.

1:10:49.460 --> 1:10:52.180
 It does not demand a lot of work when I use the,

1:10:52.180 --> 1:10:57.180
 I call it proactive takedown when he's coming to punch me

1:10:57.180 --> 1:11:02.180
 and I react, so I mean, proactive is when I'm faking it.

1:11:02.180 --> 1:11:07.180
 So I instigate the takedown by a fake, then I take him down.

1:11:07.180 --> 1:11:10.980
 And reactive is when he's, I'm baiting him to throw something

1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:11.980
 then I'm coming.

1:11:11.980 --> 1:11:12.980
 It's a counter.

1:11:12.980 --> 1:11:13.980
 Yeah.

1:11:13.980 --> 1:11:14.980
 Yes.

1:11:14.980 --> 1:11:15.980
 But all my takedown.

1:11:15.980 --> 1:11:16.980
 In the center of the octagon.

1:11:16.980 --> 1:11:17.980
 Yes.

1:11:17.980 --> 1:11:20.260
 My takedowns are more in the center of the octagon.

1:11:20.260 --> 1:11:22.740
 Like, for example, another guy that does it well is Gleason

1:11:22.740 --> 1:11:26.740
 Thibault that did it well in his best days, you know,

1:11:26.740 --> 1:11:28.820
 Khabib has more a style of chain wrestling.

1:11:28.820 --> 1:11:32.580
 I would say like Camaru Usman, sort of speak, kind of guy.

1:11:32.580 --> 1:11:33.780
 It's a different style.

1:11:33.780 --> 1:11:36.660
 You cannot compare both styles.

1:11:36.660 --> 1:11:38.540
 And that's the kind of takedown I'm good.

1:11:38.540 --> 1:11:41.180
 And I would, if I would have fight Khabib, that's one of the

1:11:41.180 --> 1:11:44.140
 strategies I would have, I wouldn't have been afraid because

1:11:44.140 --> 1:11:47.300
 everybody that I thought I was able to put them down.

1:11:47.300 --> 1:11:52.500
 And I have the pedigree to prove it in my fight resume.

1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:55.340
 So you would have perhaps seen on his back and I would have

1:11:55.340 --> 1:11:57.180
 perhaps be in my back as well.

1:11:57.180 --> 1:11:59.460
 So it would have been a very interesting fight.

1:11:59.460 --> 1:12:01.300
 How hard do you think he's to takedown?

1:12:01.300 --> 1:12:04.580
 I mean, a lot of people speak about his wrestling being just

1:12:04.580 --> 1:12:07.580
 It has nothing to do with the wrestling because

1:12:07.580 --> 1:12:08.580
 It has to do with the karate.

1:12:08.580 --> 1:12:12.260
 If I got the timing and I got my both hand around his knees,

1:12:12.260 --> 1:12:13.260
 he's going down.

1:12:13.260 --> 1:12:14.260
 Everybody goes down.

1:12:14.260 --> 1:12:15.260
 Yes.

1:12:15.260 --> 1:12:16.260
 Yes.

1:12:16.260 --> 1:12:18.500
 And I had a lot of that.

1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:19.500
 That's what I would have.

1:12:19.500 --> 1:12:23.180
 I would not have been afraid of his wrestling.

1:12:23.180 --> 1:12:24.940
 I would have be the instigator.

1:12:24.940 --> 1:12:27.980
 I would have forced the fight forward.

1:12:27.980 --> 1:12:30.860
 And that's what that's how I would have approached that fight,

1:12:30.860 --> 1:12:35.860
 which I believe most of his opponent were afraid of his

1:12:35.860 --> 1:12:38.340
 wrestling because they didn't have the tools that I have to

1:12:38.340 --> 1:12:40.060
 put him down.

1:12:40.060 --> 1:12:41.740
 I would not have forced the wrestling.

1:12:41.740 --> 1:12:44.700
 I would have in the clinch, I would have tried to disengage.

1:12:44.700 --> 1:12:47.700
 I have many ways to disengage a clinch.

1:12:47.700 --> 1:12:52.300
 I would have wanted to force the fight in a fighting distance,

1:12:52.300 --> 1:12:55.900
 you know, like in a shoot box distance, not in a wrestling

1:12:55.900 --> 1:12:57.420
 distance.

1:12:57.420 --> 1:13:02.740
 Is it possible this fight still happens?

1:13:02.740 --> 1:13:06.620
 Your young look great in a suit.

1:13:06.620 --> 1:13:10.300
 Well, there's a lot of problems now.

1:13:10.300 --> 1:13:14.580
 And the thing is, now I made peace with it.

1:13:14.580 --> 1:13:16.700
 I no longer don't want to fight.

1:13:16.700 --> 1:13:18.020
 And I don't, it's not going to happen.

1:13:18.020 --> 1:13:19.380
 UFC was not interested.

1:13:19.380 --> 1:13:23.980
 And I'm bound by contract with the UFC and by exclusivity.

1:13:23.980 --> 1:13:26.900
 There are some people says to me, oh, how about if Russian

1:13:26.900 --> 1:13:32.500
 are a crazy, wealthy Russian guy come with the money?

1:13:32.500 --> 1:13:36.820
 I said, I'm going to be in court with UFC.

1:13:36.820 --> 1:13:39.500
 And also, I'm older now.

1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:43.580
 And when I go home and I'm like, I don't want to do this.

1:13:43.580 --> 1:13:47.700
 You know, like, I don't want to do this, but like, for example,

1:13:47.700 --> 1:13:50.060
 I was training with Freddie Roach a few days ago

1:13:50.060 --> 1:13:54.300
 and I'm hitting pads, you know, and Freddie is looking at me

1:13:54.300 --> 1:13:56.300
 and he's like, hey, you have the hitchback.

1:13:56.300 --> 1:13:59.460
 I'm like, yeah, if Dana White would walk in the room

1:13:59.460 --> 1:14:03.780
 in the gym at that precise moment with the UFC contract,

1:14:03.780 --> 1:14:06.860
 I would sign it in the blink of an eye.

1:14:06.860 --> 1:14:11.780
 But when I go home, I'm like, hell no.

1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:15.740
 My belly is full, I'm healthy, I'm wealthy.

1:14:15.740 --> 1:14:17.740
 Why would I want to fight for?

1:14:17.740 --> 1:14:18.940
 I made peace with it.

1:14:18.940 --> 1:14:21.900
 But the minute I go back in the gym because I still get it

1:14:21.900 --> 1:14:25.100
 inside me when I train with the young guys, I still get it.

1:14:25.100 --> 1:14:27.940
 And a lot of guys think, hey, tell me the truth,

1:14:27.940 --> 1:14:30.140
 you're preparing a comeback because I still get it.

1:14:30.140 --> 1:14:33.020
 You know, I'm a little bit older, but I got more knowledge.

1:14:33.020 --> 1:14:35.500
 I can compensate.

1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:40.580
 I become a different animal because, you know, it changed you.

1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:46.900
 But then after you go home and you're like, man, no way I'm doing this.

1:14:46.900 --> 1:14:50.780
 It's very hard to explain, you need to be a fighter to understand

1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:53.180
 that it's very, very hard to explain.

1:14:53.180 --> 1:14:57.540
 Well, from your perspective, I think Khabib is one of the rare,

1:14:57.540 --> 1:15:01.420
 one of the few fascinating scientific puzzles yet to be solved.

1:15:01.420 --> 1:15:04.180
 So from that aspect, as a martial artist,

1:15:04.180 --> 1:15:07.100
 it's just a fascinating journey to try to solve that puzzle.

1:15:07.100 --> 1:15:12.020
 There is a thing, too, that we say, oh, who's the best fighter, people?

1:15:12.020 --> 1:15:16.620
 Like I realized that later in my life.

1:15:16.620 --> 1:15:20.940
 And I'm sure a lot of young guys will say, oh, I said, yeah, it's not...

1:15:20.940 --> 1:15:23.820
 Don't speak for me, but I'm telling you right now

1:15:23.820 --> 1:15:27.140
 what I'm about to say you will realize it later.

1:15:27.140 --> 1:15:33.420
 When I was young, I think you can proclaim yourself the bad ass man on the planet.

1:15:33.420 --> 1:15:35.940
 You know, like nobody can beat you.

1:15:35.940 --> 1:15:37.420
 It's an illusion, man.

1:15:37.420 --> 1:15:41.780
 That's the sad thing about, for example, D.C., Daniel Cormier

1:15:41.780 --> 1:15:46.300
 does probably one of the greatest, if not the greatest of all time.

1:15:46.300 --> 1:15:51.660
 You said Miochish, but like it's almost because of that little matchup with John Jones.

1:15:51.660 --> 1:15:56.220
 It's difficult for people to conceive of him as the greatest of all time.

1:15:56.220 --> 1:15:57.580
 It's all about matchup.

1:15:57.580 --> 1:15:58.940
 It's all about timing.

1:15:58.940 --> 1:16:01.540
 And also you make a fight.

1:16:01.540 --> 1:16:04.700
 You make both guys fight 10 times.

1:16:04.700 --> 1:16:07.420
 The result might be different.

1:16:07.420 --> 1:16:14.180
 Like every time, you know, I mean, maybe he's going to win 8 out of 10.

1:16:14.180 --> 1:16:16.700
 But that night is going to lose.

1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:19.820
 Why? Because we don't know the universe made it like that.

1:16:19.820 --> 1:16:22.940
 You know, maybe he got sick, maybe he had the emotional issues.

1:16:22.940 --> 1:16:28.060
 He didn't sleep well and he makes him lose focus and he got caught.

1:16:28.060 --> 1:16:31.700
 We don't know, but that's the thing with that.

1:16:31.700 --> 1:16:33.980
 People ask me, would you have done it with Khabib?

1:16:33.980 --> 1:16:35.340
 What would happen? I don't know.

1:16:35.340 --> 1:16:36.500
 Maybe out of 10 time.

1:16:36.500 --> 1:16:40.940
 I don't know. Maybe as a fighter, I hope I would have won more than him.

1:16:40.940 --> 1:16:43.860
 He thinks the opposite is only one way to find out.

1:16:43.860 --> 1:16:47.980
 But that night, if there is a fight, the guy that's going to win

1:16:47.980 --> 1:16:49.100
 doesn't mean he's the best fighter.

1:16:49.100 --> 1:16:54.100
 That's mean that he's the one that fought the best the night of the fight.

1:16:54.100 --> 1:16:56.620
 Same thing in basketball or hockey.

1:16:56.620 --> 1:16:58.460
 The team that wins the game.

1:16:58.460 --> 1:17:02.980
 It's not necessarily the best team is the team that play the best.

1:17:02.980 --> 1:17:06.420
 The night of the game and fighting is no different.

1:17:06.420 --> 1:17:09.980
 So being the baddest man on the planet, it's an illusion.

1:17:11.860 --> 1:17:15.180
 I mean, that's the tragic thing about it is on any one night,

1:17:15.740 --> 1:17:19.220
 anything can happen and that tells a story for all of human history.

1:17:19.460 --> 1:17:24.780
 It's sad to think about, but that's what makes it beautiful.

1:17:24.900 --> 1:17:30.380
 That there's so much at stake, like entire lives, all the dreams you've had

1:17:30.380 --> 1:17:33.940
 growing up, all the hard work, all of it is decided in a single night.

1:17:34.300 --> 1:17:37.180
 Even though that means nothing in terms of who's actually better.

1:17:37.540 --> 1:17:40.460
 It's I mean, that's the beauty.

1:17:40.460 --> 1:17:44.140
 That's why people love the Olympics, especially because it happens so rarely

1:17:44.420 --> 1:17:51.740
 and dreams are broken or like triumph is achieved by the unlikely hero.

1:17:51.940 --> 1:17:53.900
 All like right there.

1:17:54.860 --> 1:17:56.540
 I mean, that's that's why we love it, right?

1:17:56.540 --> 1:17:58.580
 That's why that's why I love it.

1:17:58.580 --> 1:18:01.940
 If we wouldn't know always the result before it would be boring,

1:18:01.940 --> 1:18:05.740
 that's why we do it, you know, you watch the odds, you know,

1:18:05.740 --> 1:18:10.260
 like like sometimes I like to watch the odds before a fight, you know.

1:18:11.660 --> 1:18:16.500
 Because, you know, there's things, you know, I believe in causality.

1:18:16.660 --> 1:18:19.980
 You know, I believe in everybody believe different things,

1:18:19.980 --> 1:18:24.500
 but I believe everything is because there's a there's a cause to everything.

1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:26.380
 That's personally what I believe.

1:18:26.380 --> 1:18:29.820
 I don't believe that I have like free will.

1:18:29.820 --> 1:18:33.900
 I think I have the illusion of free will, but I believe there is a cause for everything.

1:18:34.180 --> 1:18:37.820
 And if I'm doing something because of something, because of a cause,

1:18:37.820 --> 1:18:41.180
 by definition, there is no free will in a way, you know, if there is a cause

1:18:41.420 --> 1:18:43.820
 by definition, there is not.

1:18:43.820 --> 1:18:45.260
 How does that make you feel, by the way?

1:18:45.260 --> 1:18:50.300
 Like the idea that if we just look outside even just human psychology

1:18:50.300 --> 1:18:54.100
 and fighting and so on, if we look at like physics, if everything is predetermined,

1:18:54.100 --> 1:19:00.020
 if all of these little molecules interacting, it's already like your story is already written.

1:19:00.260 --> 1:19:04.940
 I mean, it depends. It's written, but I wouldn't need to know all the data

1:19:04.940 --> 1:19:06.220
 and it's impossible, right?

1:19:06.220 --> 1:19:10.140
 They like it's it's it's kind of weird.

1:19:10.140 --> 1:19:14.140
 I got to say, but I don't to me, I don't see any argument

1:19:15.300 --> 1:19:16.860
 to counter that idea.

1:19:16.860 --> 1:19:22.620
 I I I I I I I I I don't maybe I'm I'm ignorant, but I haven't seen nobody

1:19:22.620 --> 1:19:26.380
 and everything that I've read so far, there is nothing that counter

1:19:26.380 --> 1:19:30.300
 that I did that that because in a mechanical world,

1:19:31.020 --> 1:19:35.620
 if your car broke or, you know, we don't say, oh, the car decided to broke

1:19:36.020 --> 1:19:38.540
 or a tree, a tree is fall.

1:19:39.300 --> 1:19:40.820
 There's reason why the trees fall.

1:19:40.820 --> 1:19:43.340
 We don't say the trees decide to fall, right?

1:19:43.340 --> 1:19:47.340
 So because us human being, I think it's our ego we decide.

1:19:47.700 --> 1:19:50.540
 And I'm no different than anybody when I make a decision.

1:19:50.540 --> 1:19:53.500
 I decided to this, I choose to do this.

1:19:55.260 --> 1:19:59.020
 But I'm aware that there is causes

1:20:00.220 --> 1:20:02.340
 that make me do certain things.

1:20:03.020 --> 1:20:05.540
 And by definition, I think if there is a cause,

1:20:07.020 --> 1:20:08.940
 there is no free will by definition, right?

1:20:09.380 --> 1:20:11.740
 Yes, but the thing is, just like you said,

1:20:11.780 --> 1:20:15.780
 we understand so little about human intelligence, the human mind

1:20:15.780 --> 1:20:24.060
 and especially consciousness that the this giant mystery,

1:20:24.140 --> 1:20:28.540
 this darkness that we don't understand how how it how it feels

1:20:28.540 --> 1:20:33.540
 like to be something, to be a conscious being that because of that,

1:20:33.540 --> 1:20:37.500
 we're not able to really even reason about free will or not.

1:20:38.060 --> 1:20:42.740
 Because there might be some magic that comes from consciousness.

1:20:42.740 --> 1:20:47.380
 You know, the consciousness might be the thing that makes us

1:20:47.380 --> 1:20:49.100
 different from a car that breaks down.

1:20:49.620 --> 1:20:56.700
 There might be something totally fascinating, totally undiscovered

1:20:56.700 --> 1:21:00.180
 yet that will make us realize that free will is actually real

1:21:00.180 --> 1:21:02.500
 and somehow fundamental to the human experience.

1:21:02.940 --> 1:21:10.020
 So it's sometimes I think we forget when we talk about free will

1:21:10.020 --> 1:21:13.820
 and physics and it all seeming to be predetermined.

1:21:14.340 --> 1:21:17.100
 We forget how little we actually understand about the world.

1:21:18.020 --> 1:21:22.700
 And I think in that mystery, that could be totally new ideas

1:21:22.700 --> 1:21:26.300
 that are yet to be discovered and will make us realize that it's

1:21:26.300 --> 1:21:27.780
 not just an illusion.

1:21:28.540 --> 1:21:32.860
 It is something that is like at the core of how the universe works.

1:21:33.340 --> 1:21:37.820
 Some people believe that consciousness is a fundamental

1:21:37.820 --> 1:21:39.420
 property of the universe.

1:21:39.420 --> 1:21:41.540
 Like it's a it's a one of the forces of physics.

1:21:41.540 --> 1:21:45.860
 Like consciousness permeates everything in everything.

1:21:46.140 --> 1:21:50.220
 Like this table is conscious, but it's not as conscious as us

1:21:50.380 --> 1:21:52.340
 and where this little peak of consciousness.

1:21:52.740 --> 1:21:56.500
 And if that's true, and if we get to understand that, maybe there's

1:21:56.500 --> 1:22:01.020
 something there's an extra bonus we get in terms of free will.

1:22:01.420 --> 1:22:05.180
 Once you become one of those entities that are super conscious.

1:22:05.180 --> 1:22:09.340
 So I tend to be sort of humbled by the mystery of it.

1:22:10.140 --> 1:22:16.540
 Do you believe one day with with the technology that keep improving,

1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:24.980
 we will make robot that will be able to be somehow conscious?

1:22:25.460 --> 1:22:26.180
 Absolutely.

1:22:26.220 --> 1:22:27.980
 I that's been my dream.

1:22:28.020 --> 1:22:30.220
 That's been I hope I hope to do just that.

1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:34.620
 First of all, I believe that all people are capable and want

1:22:34.620 --> 1:22:36.500
 to be good to each other.

1:22:36.900 --> 1:22:43.300
 And I think love is a is a really powerful thing that connects us

1:22:43.300 --> 1:22:48.900
 and can create better and better worlds sort of like create better

1:22:48.900 --> 1:22:53.340
 and better societies that improve both the technology, the quality

1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:56.100
 of life and just the basics of human experience.

1:22:56.460 --> 1:23:00.340
 And I think creating AI systems that are conscious that are human

1:23:00.340 --> 1:23:06.900
 like can enable us to be better to each other like they can it's almost

1:23:06.900 --> 1:23:12.140
 like adding more and more kindness to the world through the systems

1:23:12.140 --> 1:23:15.260
 we interact with will inspire us to be better and better to each other.

1:23:15.900 --> 1:23:21.140
 In terms of them being conscious, I think that is an absolute requirement

1:23:22.060 --> 1:23:29.140
 that entities we interact with communicate some element of consciousness to us.

1:23:29.140 --> 1:23:30.740
 Like that's how we connect to each other.

1:23:30.940 --> 1:23:36.340
 The reason we you and I connect is that we believe that each of us are conscious.

1:23:36.980 --> 1:23:42.500
 And to me, what consciousness means is the ability to hurt, ability to to suffer

1:23:42.940 --> 1:23:45.380
 to to struggle in this world.

1:23:45.740 --> 1:23:52.020
 Because just like you said, without the struggle, you don't have the love.

1:23:52.060 --> 1:23:53.140
 You don't have the pleasure.

1:23:53.140 --> 1:23:59.340
 And ultimately, consciousness is an entity's ability to struggle, to suffer.

1:23:59.940 --> 1:24:07.780
 And from that arises the pleasure and us together being able to appreciate

1:24:07.780 --> 1:24:15.980
 sort of appreciate the highs and experience together at the lows.

1:24:16.020 --> 1:24:17.860
 That's how we form the deep connections.

1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:21.940
 I personally think we can create that in robots and I personally believe

1:24:21.940 --> 1:24:25.700
 I personally believe it's a lot easier than we think.

1:24:25.860 --> 1:24:32.900
 Does it make you afraid sometimes about the fact that one day high like

1:24:32.900 --> 1:24:38.140
 intelligence, artificial intelligence could be, you know, could hurt us?

1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:41.860
 Or, you know, like because we're, you know, because of Hollywood, of course,

1:24:41.860 --> 1:24:43.020
 you know, the movies we watch.

1:24:43.020 --> 1:24:47.380
 But it seems like when I hear sometimes Elon Musk talking, you know, like,

1:24:47.380 --> 1:24:51.980
 yeah, so Elon talks about with AI, we're summoning the demon.

1:24:52.540 --> 1:24:56.820
 He is very concerned and I talked to him about it quite a bit.

1:24:56.820 --> 1:25:00.740
 He's very concerned about all the different ways AI could hurt us humans.

1:25:02.460 --> 1:25:07.100
 I tend to believe that there's a lot more ways in which AI can make our lives

1:25:07.100 --> 1:25:10.460
 better and can make life awesome for humans.

1:25:10.460 --> 1:25:14.820
 I think humans are the ones that can do a lot of evil things.

1:25:14.820 --> 1:25:16.940
 So I'm less worried about AI.

1:25:16.940 --> 1:25:18.340
 I'm more worried about humans.

1:25:18.780 --> 1:25:24.100
 If I look at what you men have done on the course of history, you know,

1:25:24.100 --> 1:25:30.700
 for example, in regards to the planet, to the scale of the universe,

1:25:31.220 --> 1:25:37.740
 I think what I'm afraid is that we have more of a destructive force

1:25:37.740 --> 1:25:39.620
 than a beneficial force.

1:25:39.620 --> 1:25:46.340
 So if a high take that in consideration in order to protect us against ourselves,

1:25:47.060 --> 1:25:48.780
 it could hurt us.

1:25:48.780 --> 1:25:52.620
 And I don't know if you understand what like, what do you think about that?

1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:55.380
 Does it makes you afraid sometimes?

1:25:55.380 --> 1:26:01.020
 Not because of a high, but because what human are doing that high could do to us

1:26:01.020 --> 1:26:05.340
 to prevent us of hurting each or ourselves, you know?

1:26:05.340 --> 1:26:08.180
 Yeah, no, I mean, definitely it can bring out the.

1:26:08.180 --> 1:26:15.980
 The worst in human nature and provide tools for evil people to do evil things

1:26:15.980 --> 1:26:17.340
 at a larger scale.

1:26:17.340 --> 1:26:22.780
 But I just think it depends what you think human beings are.

1:26:22.780 --> 1:26:31.140
 I tend to believe that as we get more intelligent, we we start to see the value,

1:26:31.700 --> 1:26:36.380
 the evolutionary value and the value in terms of happiness of being good to each other.

1:26:36.380 --> 1:26:40.900
 And I think AI, if you look at AI as an optimization problem of how to create

1:26:40.900 --> 1:26:44.260
 a civilization that works well and expands throughout the universe,

1:26:44.260 --> 1:26:48.100
 I think love is much more effective.

1:26:48.100 --> 1:26:51.100
 So AI will help us maximize that.

1:26:51.100 --> 1:26:55.860
 I think there's going to be always spikes throughout, as it has been through human

1:26:55.860 --> 1:27:01.940
 history, where charismatic leaders will do evil onto the world in the name of good.

1:27:01.940 --> 1:27:06.620
 You have the Stalin and the Hitler's and all of that.

1:27:06.620 --> 1:27:17.260
 But ultimately, over time, I think technology will give the good, the good people power

1:27:17.260 --> 1:27:21.020
 and the evil people less power.

1:27:21.020 --> 1:27:26.020
 Now, there's a lot of ways in that, in that that won't be the case.

1:27:26.020 --> 1:27:27.660
 There's a lot of ways for it to go wrong.

1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:28.940
 And Elon talks about them.

1:27:28.940 --> 1:27:36.940
 But I honestly think in terms of intelligent AI, that's going to bring more love to the world.

1:27:36.940 --> 1:27:39.940
 The thing I'm concerned about is dumb AI.

1:27:39.940 --> 1:27:44.940
 So there's been a lot of discussion between China and the United States recently on

1:27:44.940 --> 1:27:46.940
 autonomous weapons system.

1:27:46.940 --> 1:27:49.940
 This is something people don't, they're afraid to talk about.

1:27:49.940 --> 1:27:59.940
 But there's now a race where the United States has officially said that they're not against

1:27:59.940 --> 1:28:02.940
 adding AI to its weapons systems.

1:28:02.940 --> 1:28:12.940
 So now the US military is adding automation, adding intelligence to its drones, to its

1:28:12.940 --> 1:28:14.940
 anything that can create damage.

1:28:14.940 --> 1:28:20.940
 And so, of course, they did this so in response to China doing that.

1:28:20.940 --> 1:28:23.940
 So you can imagine, this is Terminator.

1:28:23.940 --> 1:28:27.940
 You think about Terminator as intelligent systems, they're not.

1:28:27.940 --> 1:28:29.940
 They're pretty dumb.

1:28:29.940 --> 1:28:33.940
 The point is, they're efficient at doing what they do.

1:28:33.940 --> 1:28:38.940
 And in the space of war, efficient at doing what you do means killing.

1:28:38.940 --> 1:28:40.940
 So that I'm really afraid of.

1:28:40.940 --> 1:28:42.940
 But those are dumb AI.

1:28:42.940 --> 1:28:48.940
 Those aren't your loving, deep, fulfilling relationships.

1:28:48.940 --> 1:28:55.940
 That's like efficiently being able to fly, to plan the trajectory of dropping bombs, of

1:28:55.940 --> 1:29:01.940
 missiles, of how to do counter attacks, of how to maximize the destruction of a particular

1:29:01.940 --> 1:29:03.940
 facility instead of individuals.

1:29:03.940 --> 1:29:06.940
 And then that can just escalate.

1:29:06.940 --> 1:29:11.940
 And as opposed to the Cold War with the Soviet Union, this could be a hot war.

1:29:11.940 --> 1:29:18.940
 And then the consequences, once you allow, it's kind of terrifying.

1:29:18.940 --> 1:29:21.940
 Because currently, the drones are operated by humans.

1:29:21.940 --> 1:29:29.940
 So you have, say, you have information about intelligence gives you information about a

1:29:29.940 --> 1:29:32.940
 particular terrorist located in this area.

1:29:32.940 --> 1:29:39.940
 And then you use drones to maybe the automation there is to help you figure out what is the

1:29:39.940 --> 1:29:43.940
 best trajectory to strike at that location.

1:29:43.940 --> 1:29:49.940
 So you still have a human that pulls the trigger at the end, dropping the bomb.

1:29:49.940 --> 1:29:56.940
 Now, automation and AI in autonomous weapons systems might be where you say, there's a bad

1:29:56.940 --> 1:30:01.940
 guy over here, you figure out how to get rid of the bad guy.

1:30:01.940 --> 1:30:06.940
 So then, of course, the systems will be very good at finding the right trajectory and so

1:30:06.940 --> 1:30:13.940
 on, but there's bugs that can happen, unexpected bugs, that the system might figure out that

1:30:13.940 --> 1:30:19.940
 there is this bad guy might actually be in these other five locations.

1:30:19.940 --> 1:30:23.940
 So it might make sense to cover the entire area, right?

1:30:23.940 --> 1:30:27.940
 And so you might drop bombs on the entire area.

1:30:27.940 --> 1:30:30.940
 And then, you know, that's just okay.

1:30:30.940 --> 1:30:33.940
 So that's going to lead to a lot of destruction at a scale of a city.

1:30:33.940 --> 1:30:36.940
 But then you can immediately take that to nuclear weapons.

1:30:36.940 --> 1:30:43.940
 If you add automation to responding to counterattacks to nuclear weapons, you might get information

1:30:43.940 --> 1:30:47.940
 that somebody is planning a nuclear attack on the United States, and the AI system will

1:30:47.940 --> 1:30:49.940
 immediately respond.

1:30:49.940 --> 1:30:53.940
 And, you know, it can respond at a scale of launching nuclear weapons itself.

1:30:53.940 --> 1:30:58.940
 And so there's all of these possibilities that don't require much intelligence.

1:30:58.940 --> 1:31:03.940
 And that's exceptionally concerning.

1:31:03.940 --> 1:31:08.940
 I'm like you, I do not believe there is babies that are born bad.

1:31:08.940 --> 1:31:14.940
 I think people do bad things because of their experience.

1:31:14.940 --> 1:31:21.940
 However, if I look through my experience and from what I can see, very often,

1:31:21.940 --> 1:31:28.940
 men's power wants more power.

1:31:28.940 --> 1:31:30.940
 That's what makes me afraid.

1:31:30.940 --> 1:31:32.940
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:31:32.940 --> 1:31:36.940
 Listen, I've come from the Soviet Union.

1:31:36.940 --> 1:31:40.940
 Stalin is arguably one of the most powerful humans in history.

1:31:40.940 --> 1:31:43.940
 He's not talked to often enough about by the evils he's done.

1:31:43.940 --> 1:31:45.940
 Hitler gets all the attention.

1:31:45.940 --> 1:31:49.940
 But Stalin has done arguably much more evil than Hitler.

1:31:49.940 --> 1:31:51.940
 Yeah, this is human nature.

1:31:51.940 --> 1:31:53.940
 He wants power.

1:31:53.940 --> 1:31:54.940
 We see that with institutions.

1:31:54.940 --> 1:31:56.940
 We see that with governments and nations.

1:31:56.940 --> 1:32:00.940
 I think you see this with the internet.

1:32:00.940 --> 1:32:05.940
 People are really hungry for the distribution of power.

1:32:05.940 --> 1:32:10.940
 You see that people are very much distrustful of centralized places of power,

1:32:10.940 --> 1:32:12.940
 of institutions and so on.

1:32:12.940 --> 1:32:18.940
 So I think successful organizations, successful companies, successful governments

1:32:18.940 --> 1:32:21.940
 will be run by people who distribute the power.

1:32:21.940 --> 1:32:24.940
 I don't trust myself with power at all.

1:32:24.940 --> 1:32:30.940
 And I think you have to build into the system that no one person can have power,

1:32:30.940 --> 1:32:32.940
 that you distribute it.

1:32:32.940 --> 1:32:36.940
 That's where you have, in the financial sector, you have cryptocurrency right now

1:32:36.940 --> 1:32:38.940
 with Bitcoin and all those kinds of things.

1:32:38.940 --> 1:32:44.940
 People are exploring, how can we avoid the central bank to have control?

1:32:44.940 --> 1:32:48.940
 With the power in the hands of people, thousands of people, millions of people.

1:32:48.940 --> 1:32:56.940
 In the same way with military, with any kind of technology,

1:32:56.940 --> 1:32:59.940
 I think the future looks very distributed.

1:32:59.940 --> 1:33:03.940
 What do you think about militarizing space?

1:33:03.940 --> 1:33:07.940
 The space force.

1:33:07.940 --> 1:33:13.940
 I don't think about it often because right now I'm filled with excitement about space exploration,

1:33:13.940 --> 1:33:15.940
 which is the positive aspect.

1:33:15.940 --> 1:33:21.940
 So Elon, you know, I was born in an era where it was exciting.

1:33:21.940 --> 1:33:25.940
 I don't know about you, but for me it's exciting to look up to the stars

1:33:25.940 --> 1:33:32.940
 and dream about us humans colonizing Mars, colonizing other planets,

1:33:32.940 --> 1:33:34.940
 expanding out to the galaxy and to the universe.

1:33:34.940 --> 1:33:36.940
 That's really exciting.

1:33:36.940 --> 1:33:42.940
 So the possibilities there are endless.

1:33:42.940 --> 1:33:46.940
 I don't think, because also the resources are endless.

1:33:46.940 --> 1:33:51.940
 And so I think we get into trouble with militarization, with wars,

1:33:51.940 --> 1:33:53.940
 when the resources are very constrained.

1:33:53.940 --> 1:33:58.940
 So I think for a while we're not going to be fighting.

1:33:58.940 --> 1:34:04.940
 The only wars we'll be fighting in space are the ones that kind of help us.

1:34:04.940 --> 1:34:06.940
 Another nation to compete.

1:34:06.940 --> 1:34:08.940
 Who goes to the moon first, I guess.

1:34:08.940 --> 1:34:13.940
 Yes, those kinds of things are maybe for satellites and all those kinds of communication

1:34:13.940 --> 1:34:18.940
 and maybe in assistance for cyber warfare, which is also very dangerous.

1:34:18.940 --> 1:34:28.940
 But in terms of the wars out in space, I think everything out in space will be positive and inspiring.

1:34:28.940 --> 1:34:32.940
 It's very hard, but all good things are hard, I think.

1:34:32.940 --> 1:34:37.940
 This is where I've been talking to a bunch of people about extraterrestrial life.

1:34:37.940 --> 1:34:41.940
 I'm really excited by...

1:34:41.940 --> 1:34:43.940
 I don't know, it's the other thing.

1:34:43.940 --> 1:34:47.940
 When I look out to the stars, it's exciting to me.

1:34:47.940 --> 1:34:50.940
 I know I think you've spoken about it being scary.

1:34:50.940 --> 1:34:54.940
 But to me, it's exciting that there's intelligent creatures out there,

1:34:54.940 --> 1:34:57.940
 far beyond perhaps the intelligence of our own,

1:34:57.940 --> 1:35:00.940
 that are just too far away to explore yet,

1:35:00.940 --> 1:35:03.940
 but we might one day come in contact with them.

1:35:03.940 --> 1:35:07.940
 That to me is the ultimate motivator,

1:35:07.940 --> 1:35:12.940
 is to meet other intelligent life forms out there and connect with them.

1:35:12.940 --> 1:35:15.940
 Have you ever met Jacques Vallée?

1:35:15.940 --> 1:35:17.940
 No, but I've been in communication.

1:35:17.940 --> 1:35:20.940
 I hope to talk to him. He's an amazing French.

1:35:20.940 --> 1:35:24.940
 I know that there are many theories about...

1:35:24.940 --> 1:35:27.940
 If there's alien, we don't know, right?

1:35:27.940 --> 1:35:31.940
 But some people think it's from another star system.

1:35:31.940 --> 1:35:33.940
 Jacques Vallée has a...

1:35:33.940 --> 1:35:36.940
 To make a long story short, he has a different theory.

1:35:36.940 --> 1:35:44.940
 He thinks it's perhaps beings that could be living in a different dimension than us.

1:35:44.940 --> 1:35:48.940
 And the reason why he says that is when he makes an experiment...

1:35:48.940 --> 1:35:51.940
 When there is a sightings very often of a UFO,

1:35:51.940 --> 1:35:56.940
 let's say I'm the UFO, you have three guys.

1:35:56.940 --> 1:36:00.940
 They are looking at the UFO very often.

1:36:00.940 --> 1:36:05.940
 One experiment that you can do, and sometimes that is the case,

1:36:05.940 --> 1:36:07.940
 you ask your two friends to walk on the side,

1:36:07.940 --> 1:36:10.940
 and there's a point that it's like a corridor.

1:36:10.940 --> 1:36:14.940
 You see the UFO, then you stop seeing it like a corridor.

1:36:14.940 --> 1:36:19.940
 That's one of the reasons why he's saying that it's perhaps dimension.

1:36:19.940 --> 1:36:21.940
 And I found that fascinating.

1:36:21.940 --> 1:36:25.940
 This is what, to the discussion of consciousness and all that,

1:36:25.940 --> 1:36:30.940
 it feels like we might be just experiencing a very particular slice of this universe.

1:36:30.940 --> 1:36:33.940
 We might not be understanding what's at the higher dimensions,

1:36:33.940 --> 1:36:37.940
 or higher dimensions in whatever form that means.

1:36:37.940 --> 1:36:43.940
 There's all these physical theories now that describe a world with dimensions

1:36:43.940 --> 1:36:48.940
 that's much higher than the three dimension of space in the one dimension of time.

1:36:48.940 --> 1:36:52.940
 So whatever the hell is going on in those other dimensions,

1:36:52.940 --> 1:36:57.940
 it could be something, unfortunately, this is the sad part.

1:36:57.940 --> 1:37:01.940
 It might be something we can't even comprehend with our human brains.

1:37:01.940 --> 1:37:07.940
 That the limitations are just, I mean, we're just descendants of apes.

1:37:07.940 --> 1:37:10.940
 So it might not be possible to even understand.

1:37:10.940 --> 1:37:12.940
 Is there alien? Is there another dimension?

1:37:12.940 --> 1:37:14.940
 Are they human from the future?

1:37:14.940 --> 1:37:18.940
 Is there perhaps Chinese or another group of people

1:37:18.940 --> 1:37:21.940
 that are working with technology far behind?

1:37:21.940 --> 1:37:26.940
 Lex, I had the chance to meet, because of the sport I'm doing,

1:37:26.940 --> 1:37:30.940
 I met a lot of people in military and politics sometimes,

1:37:30.940 --> 1:37:33.940
 that I asked them every time.

1:37:33.940 --> 1:37:39.940
 I met one this week, and I asked him, I said,

1:37:39.940 --> 1:37:41.940
 is it true about the UFOs there?

1:37:41.940 --> 1:37:45.940
 And he says to me, even before I asked him,

1:37:45.940 --> 1:37:48.940
 I said, I sort of have to ask you a question.

1:37:48.940 --> 1:37:50.940
 I was in Los Angeles.

1:37:50.940 --> 1:37:52.940
 And I said, sorry, I have to ask you a question.

1:37:52.940 --> 1:37:54.940
 He said, oh, you want to ask me about UFO right away?

1:37:54.940 --> 1:37:56.940
 I said, yes.

1:37:56.940 --> 1:37:57.940
 He saw it in your eyes.

1:37:57.940 --> 1:38:00.940
 He said, yeah, there's things that flies that we don't know.

1:38:00.940 --> 1:38:02.940
 But he didn't tell me, he doesn't know,

1:38:02.940 --> 1:38:04.940
 they don't know if it's alien or whatever,

1:38:04.940 --> 1:38:06.940
 but there's things apparently that are detected,

1:38:06.940 --> 1:38:09.940
 and I know you met Fravor.

1:38:09.940 --> 1:38:11.940
 Fravor is fascinating.

1:38:11.940 --> 1:38:13.940
 It makes me sad that...

1:38:13.940 --> 1:38:15.940
 We live in a different era now,

1:38:15.940 --> 1:38:18.940
 that it used to be a subject that was ridiculed,

1:38:18.940 --> 1:38:22.940
 and now it's so cool that I'm very excited to live

1:38:22.940 --> 1:38:24.940
 into that era.

1:38:24.940 --> 1:38:26.940
 Yeah, it's really exciting,

1:38:26.940 --> 1:38:28.940
 but still the governments are kind of behind the times

1:38:28.940 --> 1:38:30.940
 on that aspect.

1:38:30.940 --> 1:38:34.940
 They're not transparent, and they don't communicate well.

1:38:34.940 --> 1:38:38.940
 It saddens me to think the possibility that

1:38:38.940 --> 1:38:42.940
 the US government might be in possession of something

1:38:42.940 --> 1:38:45.940
 that they don't tell the world about

1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:47.940
 because they're just scared.

1:38:47.940 --> 1:38:49.940
 It's because they don't know what the hell it is,

1:38:49.940 --> 1:38:51.940
 and they don't want the Chinese to gain the technology

1:38:51.940 --> 1:38:53.940
 or all those kinds of things.

1:38:53.940 --> 1:38:56.940
 Do you think the president of the United States,

1:38:56.940 --> 1:38:58.940
 for example, because the president comes and goes

1:38:58.940 --> 1:39:00.940
 every, right, four or eight years,

1:39:00.940 --> 1:39:02.940
 do you think he would know all the secrets

1:39:02.940 --> 1:39:05.940
 or it would be a guy like, for example,

1:39:05.940 --> 1:39:08.940
 Vladimir Putin would know much of, you know what I mean?

1:39:08.940 --> 1:39:13.940
 I don't think the president even knows all the secrets.

1:39:13.940 --> 1:39:15.940
 The US president, yeah.

1:39:15.940 --> 1:39:17.940
 I don't think so, because he goes,

1:39:17.940 --> 1:39:20.940
 they go back and forth every four years.

1:39:20.940 --> 1:39:22.940
 They have the terms, right?

1:39:22.940 --> 1:39:25.940
 I wasn't sure before,

1:39:25.940 --> 1:39:28.940
 but I think I could trust the previous

1:39:28.940 --> 1:39:31.940
 United States president of Donald Trump

1:39:31.940 --> 1:39:36.940
 that if he knew, he would probably tweet about it.

1:39:36.940 --> 1:39:38.940
 Perhaps.

1:39:41.940 --> 1:39:43.940
 I've worked with DARPA.

1:39:43.940 --> 1:39:46.940
 I've worked with the DOD at clearance,

1:39:46.940 --> 1:39:48.940
 and I think from the perspective,

1:39:48.940 --> 1:39:52.940
 if you see the world as fundamentally a dangerous world

1:39:52.940 --> 1:39:55.940
 where secrets are important to have

1:39:55.940 --> 1:39:57.940
 from a military perspective,

1:39:57.940 --> 1:40:01.940
 I think it's very unsafe to tell the president

1:40:01.940 --> 1:40:05.940
 of the United States that you have this kind of technology.

1:40:05.940 --> 1:40:07.940
 So if you think of the world in that way,

1:40:07.940 --> 1:40:10.940
 I hate that that's how that world is viewed,

1:40:10.940 --> 1:40:13.940
 because ultimately, I think what's more powerful

1:40:13.940 --> 1:40:15.940
 than the military secrets,

1:40:15.940 --> 1:40:18.940
 and I hope that actually is what will happen in the 21st century,

1:40:18.940 --> 1:40:22.940
 what's more powerful is inspire people.

1:40:22.940 --> 1:40:26.940
 Inspire the young Elon Musk's of the world

1:40:26.940 --> 1:40:28.940
 to create cool new things.

1:40:28.940 --> 1:40:33.940
 If we have technology that we have encountered

1:40:33.940 --> 1:40:35.940
 that we don't understand,

1:40:35.940 --> 1:40:39.940
 that should only be inspiration to develop that kind of stuff.

1:40:39.940 --> 1:40:43.940
 It shouldn't be seen as a military threat,

1:40:43.940 --> 1:40:45.940
 as a secret to hold on to.

1:40:45.940 --> 1:40:48.940
 I think secrets...

1:40:48.940 --> 1:40:51.940
 I hope we more and more let go of the idea

1:40:51.940 --> 1:40:54.940
 that there are secrets that give us advantage.

1:40:54.940 --> 1:40:56.940
 In the tech sector,

1:40:56.940 --> 1:40:59.940
 people are more and more releasing the software,

1:40:59.940 --> 1:41:01.940
 making it open source.

1:41:01.940 --> 1:41:04.940
 Secrets don't make sense.

1:41:04.940 --> 1:41:06.940
 They share the knowledge.

1:41:06.940 --> 1:41:08.940
 They share the knowledge.

1:41:08.940 --> 1:41:10.940
 Being afraid to share the knowledge,

1:41:10.940 --> 1:41:13.940
 I think, I hope, is an old idea.

1:41:13.940 --> 1:41:17.940
 When you make it, things more compartmentalize.

1:41:17.940 --> 1:41:19.940
 That's the other thing,

1:41:19.940 --> 1:41:22.940
 is the bureaucracy of government.

1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:24.940
 People only know their own little thing,

1:41:24.940 --> 1:41:26.940
 and they don't spread the information.

1:41:26.940 --> 1:41:28.940
 It doesn't travel well.

1:41:28.940 --> 1:41:30.940
 There's a lot of inefficiencies there.

1:41:30.940 --> 1:41:32.940
 It makes me sad,

1:41:32.940 --> 1:41:35.940
 because the science, the engineering

1:41:35.940 --> 1:41:37.940
 that happens in governments,

1:41:37.940 --> 1:41:40.940
 developing the different airplanes

1:41:40.940 --> 1:41:42.940
 they use for military applications,

1:41:42.940 --> 1:41:44.940
 is some of the most incredible engineering ever.

1:41:44.940 --> 1:41:47.940
 It's secret, because they're afraid to share it

1:41:47.940 --> 1:41:50.940
 with the Russians and the Chinese and so on.

1:41:50.940 --> 1:41:52.940
 But on that topic,

1:41:52.940 --> 1:41:54.940
 I do think somebody like Vladimir Putin,

1:41:54.940 --> 1:41:57.940
 probably knows some stuff.

1:41:57.940 --> 1:41:59.940
 My God.

1:41:59.940 --> 1:42:01.940
 I would love to know what he knows.

1:42:01.940 --> 1:42:03.940
 But then again, you never know,

1:42:03.940 --> 1:42:05.940
 because even he is...

1:42:05.940 --> 1:42:08.940
 I think of him as an exceptionally powerful person,

1:42:08.940 --> 1:42:11.940
 but he's also just managing a bunch of tribes.

1:42:11.940 --> 1:42:13.940
 His power is very limited.

1:42:13.940 --> 1:42:16.940
 He's trying to hold together

1:42:16.940 --> 1:42:21.940
 a bunch of greedy, power hungry madmen.

1:42:21.940 --> 1:42:24.940
 He's trying to establish a balance.

1:42:24.940 --> 1:42:26.940
 He might not know everything.

1:42:26.940 --> 1:42:28.940
 I hope this changes,

1:42:28.940 --> 1:42:31.940
 because I think there's nothing more exciting about...

1:42:31.940 --> 1:42:34.940
 I don't even know if there is a human that knows.

1:42:34.940 --> 1:42:36.940
 You know what I mean?

1:42:36.940 --> 1:42:39.940
 This idea that there's some alien civilization

1:42:39.940 --> 1:42:41.940
 that land on the White House

1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:43.940
 and say, all right, I come to meet the prison.

1:42:43.940 --> 1:42:45.940
 I'm like, why would they do that?

1:42:45.940 --> 1:42:47.940
 You know what I mean?

1:42:47.940 --> 1:42:49.940
 It's kind of absurd.

1:42:49.940 --> 1:42:51.940
 Well, I do think that actually...

1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:53.940
 I mean, that's one possibility, right?

1:42:53.940 --> 1:42:58.940
 If an alien civilization really wanted to contact us,

1:42:58.940 --> 1:43:00.940
 I think everybody would know.

1:43:00.940 --> 1:43:02.940
 So I think we're...

1:43:02.940 --> 1:43:04.940
 If there's any kind of interaction

1:43:04.940 --> 1:43:07.940
 between humans and aliens,

1:43:07.940 --> 1:43:10.940
 I think most likely what we're interacting with

1:43:10.940 --> 1:43:14.940
 is a crappy probe drone thing

1:43:14.940 --> 1:43:16.940
 that kind of just like...

1:43:16.940 --> 1:43:18.940
 Yeah, more and more.

1:43:18.940 --> 1:43:20.940
 This dumb thing...

1:43:20.940 --> 1:43:22.940
 We're not interacting with the aliens.

1:43:22.940 --> 1:43:25.940
 I think just like for us,

1:43:25.940 --> 1:43:27.940
 I think humans aren't...

1:43:27.940 --> 1:43:31.940
 when we venture out into space,

1:43:31.940 --> 1:43:33.940
 the first thing that's going to meet aliens

1:43:33.940 --> 1:43:34.940
 is our robots.

1:43:34.940 --> 1:43:36.940
 It's not us humans,

1:43:36.940 --> 1:43:38.940
 because we keep sending robots out.

1:43:38.940 --> 1:43:42.940
 So they're going to make decisions about humans

1:43:42.940 --> 1:43:44.940
 by looking at the robots.

1:43:44.940 --> 1:43:46.940
 They're famous grays.

1:43:46.940 --> 1:43:47.940
 The grays.

1:43:47.940 --> 1:43:49.940
 Maybe they are robots.

1:43:49.940 --> 1:43:51.940
 Maybe it's all BS too, you know?

1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:53.940
 Yeah, so I don't know...

1:43:53.940 --> 1:43:56.940
 I don't know what that interaction actually would look like

1:43:56.940 --> 1:43:58.940
 if aliens really wanted to reach out,

1:43:58.940 --> 1:43:59.940
 really communicate.

1:43:59.940 --> 1:44:01.940
 And I don't know if we're able to actually communicate with them.

1:44:01.940 --> 1:44:03.940
 That's one of the sad things.

1:44:03.940 --> 1:44:05.940
 We might not be able to...

1:44:05.940 --> 1:44:08.940
 The aliens might already be here,

1:44:08.940 --> 1:44:11.940
 and we might just not even know

1:44:11.940 --> 1:44:14.940
 how to see them or know how to communicate with them.

1:44:14.940 --> 1:44:18.940
 There's so much misinformation,

1:44:18.940 --> 1:44:20.940
 and sometimes there's people

1:44:20.940 --> 1:44:25.940
 that are very credible that made crazy claims.

1:44:25.940 --> 1:44:28.940
 You don't know what to believe.

1:44:28.940 --> 1:44:30.940
 Like Paul Elyer,

1:44:30.940 --> 1:44:33.940
 the Minister of Defence of Canada,

1:44:33.940 --> 1:44:37.940
 said that there are many alien rays that ever...

1:44:37.940 --> 1:44:38.940
 That's what he said.

1:44:38.940 --> 1:44:39.940
 Research it.

1:44:39.940 --> 1:44:42.940
 And that scientist from,

1:44:42.940 --> 1:44:44.940
 I think Israel recently,

1:44:44.940 --> 1:44:46.940
 said something about Trump.

1:44:46.940 --> 1:44:48.940
 He was keeping secret.

1:44:48.940 --> 1:44:49.940
 Medvedev, you're from Russia.

1:44:49.940 --> 1:44:52.940
 Medvedev, I've been caught during a break

1:44:52.940 --> 1:44:54.940
 in between interviews to talk about,

1:44:54.940 --> 1:44:56.940
 like, oh, it's like men in black,

1:44:56.940 --> 1:44:58.940
 I don't know what to speak.

1:44:58.940 --> 1:44:59.940
 I don't know.

1:44:59.940 --> 1:45:01.940
 It didn't look like he was joking,

1:45:01.940 --> 1:45:03.940
 but I don't know if he was saying the truth.

1:45:03.940 --> 1:45:05.940
 Yeah, you can check on YouTube.

1:45:05.940 --> 1:45:07.940
 It went viral.

1:45:07.940 --> 1:45:10.940
 Yeah, there's a lot of things like that sometimes.

1:45:10.940 --> 1:45:13.940
 Or Bob Lazar, I'm like,

1:45:13.940 --> 1:45:16.940
 imagine if it's true, man.

1:45:16.940 --> 1:45:19.940
 Imagine if we're like a fish in the water

1:45:19.940 --> 1:45:21.940
 who live in our home world,

1:45:21.940 --> 1:45:24.940
 and sometimes there's a fisherman that grabbed the fish,

1:45:24.940 --> 1:45:27.940
 back in the water, and the fish goes back to the other fish and says,

1:45:27.940 --> 1:45:30.940
 hey, there's someone that take me out of the water,

1:45:30.940 --> 1:45:33.940
 then I've seen things that I did not like.

1:45:33.940 --> 1:45:35.940
 Imagine if it's true, like,

1:45:35.940 --> 1:45:38.940
 and one other thing, like,

1:45:38.940 --> 1:45:41.940
 I wanted to ask you because you were consciousness.

1:45:41.940 --> 1:45:42.940
 How about dreams?

1:45:42.940 --> 1:45:44.940
 What is a dream?

1:45:44.940 --> 1:45:47.940
 I more and more, I don't know if you're paying attention to this.

1:45:47.940 --> 1:45:50.940
 There's now, it's become more acceptable in the scientific community

1:45:50.940 --> 1:45:53.940
 to do large scale studies of psychedelics, for example.

1:45:53.940 --> 1:45:56.940
 And there's a lot of connection between psychedelics and dreams.

1:45:56.940 --> 1:45:58.940
 There's very similar states.

1:45:58.940 --> 1:46:02.940
 There's a lot our mind does when it detaches itself from reality,

1:46:02.940 --> 1:46:05.940
 that it can just explore a lot of different ideas.

1:46:05.940 --> 1:46:08.940
 It's very possible that dreams is you're traveling somewhere.

1:46:08.940 --> 1:46:11.940
 And the same thing with psychedelics, you're traveling somewhere.

1:46:11.940 --> 1:46:14.940
 In a different, not traveling to physical space,

1:46:14.940 --> 1:46:16.940
 it's the other dimensions that we're talking about.

1:46:16.940 --> 1:46:18.940
 You're traveling some other,

1:46:18.940 --> 1:46:21.940
 through some other dimension to meet some other creature.

1:46:21.940 --> 1:46:24.940
 People talk with DMT that they meet some elves.

1:46:24.940 --> 1:46:26.940
 I've never done, I'd like to.

1:46:26.940 --> 1:46:29.940
 I don't know if there's a safe, legal way to do it,

1:46:29.940 --> 1:46:33.940
 but they all talk about meeting elves

1:46:33.940 --> 1:46:36.940
 and creatures, like entities.

1:46:36.940 --> 1:46:38.940
 Like, who are they?

1:46:38.940 --> 1:46:40.940
 What's...

1:46:40.940 --> 1:46:41.940
 What is this?

1:46:41.940 --> 1:46:43.940
 Is it because they're high or is it because...

1:46:43.940 --> 1:46:45.940
 They're actually meeting something.

1:46:45.940 --> 1:46:47.940
 And maybe there's no difference.

1:46:47.940 --> 1:46:49.940
 I mean, who knows exactly.

1:46:49.940 --> 1:46:51.940
 That takes us right back to us,

1:46:51.940 --> 1:46:54.940
 not being able to really understand how our mind works.

1:46:54.940 --> 1:46:57.940
 You know, I work in artificial intelligence.

1:46:57.940 --> 1:47:01.940
 It's clear that we understand so little about intelligence,

1:47:01.940 --> 1:47:03.940
 some basic things about intelligence.

1:47:03.940 --> 1:47:09.940
 Just at the very sort of basic first principles level,

1:47:09.940 --> 1:47:13.940
 we don't understand what it means to reason,

1:47:13.940 --> 1:47:18.940
 to think, to assimilate pieces of knowledge together

1:47:18.940 --> 1:47:20.940
 from the basics to the complex.

1:47:20.940 --> 1:47:21.940
 We don't understand it.

1:47:21.940 --> 1:47:24.940
 We don't understand how the human mind does it.

1:47:24.940 --> 1:47:26.940
 We don't understand how the human mind is able to take

1:47:26.940 --> 1:47:29.940
 incredible waterfall of information

1:47:29.940 --> 1:47:33.940
 and filter cleanly into just, like, clean.

1:47:33.940 --> 1:47:35.940
 You only see the things that are important

1:47:35.940 --> 1:47:37.940
 and are able to stitch them together

1:47:37.940 --> 1:47:39.940
 and be able to reason about the world.

1:47:39.940 --> 1:47:43.940
 And at the same time have moments of genius, of creativity.

1:47:43.940 --> 1:47:45.940
 Like, what is that?

1:47:45.940 --> 1:47:48.940
 That also, you know, people, writers talk about that,

1:47:48.940 --> 1:47:50.940
 that they're, you know, they're almost like communicating

1:47:50.940 --> 1:47:51.940
 with the muse.

1:47:51.940 --> 1:47:53.940
 Like, where do ideas come from?

1:47:53.940 --> 1:47:55.940
 This is the Joe Rogan philosophy.

1:47:55.940 --> 1:47:57.940
 But I do know that past civilization,

1:47:57.940 --> 1:48:00.940
 where a lot of them were based on shamanism.

1:48:00.940 --> 1:48:03.940
 And you know what, I think it's sad is,

1:48:03.940 --> 1:48:07.940
 if someone drank alcohol and when he's drunk,

1:48:07.940 --> 1:48:12.940
 he's going to commit, like, create, like, like murders or something.

1:48:12.940 --> 1:48:14.940
 We're gonna blame the person, right?

1:48:14.940 --> 1:48:16.940
 We're gonna say that's his fault.

1:48:16.940 --> 1:48:18.940
 It's not the fault of alcohol.

1:48:18.940 --> 1:48:21.940
 However, if someone does psychedelic or any things

1:48:21.940 --> 1:48:24.940
 that is illegal and do something crazy,

1:48:24.940 --> 1:48:28.940
 now we're gonna put the fault on psychedelic,

1:48:28.940 --> 1:48:29.940
 you know what I mean?

1:48:29.940 --> 1:48:33.940
 And perhaps the person itself is the reason

1:48:33.940 --> 1:48:35.940
 why, you know, he's been doing these things,

1:48:35.940 --> 1:48:36.940
 you know what I mean?

1:48:36.940 --> 1:48:40.940
 So, yeah, it's fascinating how, like, society,

1:48:40.940 --> 1:48:43.940
 you know, like in Canada, they just legalize marijuana.

1:48:43.940 --> 1:48:44.940
 Oh, yeah?

1:48:44.940 --> 1:48:46.940
 Yeah, marijuana is legal.

1:48:46.940 --> 1:48:49.940
 But before that, before they did it, like,

1:48:49.940 --> 1:48:51.940
 if you talk, for example, to my dad, my dad,

1:48:51.940 --> 1:48:54.940
 he's against it, like, because he's a whole mentality.

1:48:54.940 --> 1:48:56.940
 He's like, it's drug, it's bad.

1:48:56.940 --> 1:48:59.940
 But drinking a glass, you know, drinking a beer, it's fine.

1:48:59.940 --> 1:49:02.940
 I mean, what is, you know what I mean?

1:49:02.940 --> 1:49:04.940
 What is good, what is bad?

1:49:04.940 --> 1:49:07.940
 I guess you think chocolate could be bad as well

1:49:07.940 --> 1:49:10.940
 for your health or, I mean, I'm going to the extreme now,

1:49:10.940 --> 1:49:12.940
 but what is good, what is bad?

1:49:12.940 --> 1:49:14.940
 If you use it for recreation,

1:49:14.940 --> 1:49:18.940
 you use it for an experience, to learn about yourself.

1:49:18.940 --> 1:49:22.940
 It's like, the line is very tiny, you know?

1:49:22.940 --> 1:49:26.940
 There are some countries that drugs are all legals,

1:49:26.940 --> 1:49:27.940
 you know what I mean?

1:49:27.940 --> 1:49:29.940
 And I don't know the stats,

1:49:29.940 --> 1:49:31.940
 but I would be interesting to know

1:49:31.940 --> 1:49:35.940
 if they have more crimes there

1:49:35.940 --> 1:49:38.940
 than other countries where it's more strict.

1:49:38.940 --> 1:49:40.940
 I would be interesting to know about that.

1:49:40.940 --> 1:49:42.940
 It's fascinating to me, you know?

1:49:42.940 --> 1:49:45.940
 Yeah, and I mean, we humans kind of just come up with

1:49:45.940 --> 1:49:47.940
 arbitrary lines of what's good, what's bad,

1:49:47.940 --> 1:49:50.940
 that applies with drugs, that applies with anything,

1:49:50.940 --> 1:49:53.940
 that applies with animals, for example.

1:49:53.940 --> 1:49:55.940
 We talked about carnivore diet.

1:49:55.940 --> 1:49:58.940
 Maybe the time we live in now will be remembered

1:49:58.940 --> 1:50:01.940
 for the cruelty to animals, for example.

1:50:01.940 --> 1:50:05.940
 And I believe this, the 21st century,

1:50:05.940 --> 1:50:09.940
 will be remembered for our cruelty to robots.

1:50:09.940 --> 1:50:14.940
 That eventually there'll be a civil rights movement

1:50:14.940 --> 1:50:18.940
 for robots, the ones who choose to be conscious,

1:50:18.940 --> 1:50:21.940
 the ones who have consciousness will say,

1:50:21.940 --> 1:50:23.940
 we deserve rights too.

1:50:23.940 --> 1:50:26.940
 We deserve to be treated with respect too.

1:50:26.940 --> 1:50:29.940
 How about the people we put in jail?

1:50:29.940 --> 1:50:30.940
 People put in jail.

1:50:30.940 --> 1:50:33.940
 I mean, I think in the future we'll look back

1:50:33.940 --> 1:50:36.940
 and we'll think of ourselves being stupid

1:50:36.940 --> 1:50:40.940
 to put people in jail instead of, you know,

1:50:40.940 --> 1:50:45.940
 like trying to fix the problem at the base, you know?

1:50:45.940 --> 1:50:48.940
 Of course now, or I guess it's our ignorance

1:50:48.940 --> 1:50:51.940
 that made it in a way that we cannot sometimes understand

1:50:51.940 --> 1:50:54.940
 what makes sometimes a psychopath a psychopath

1:50:54.940 --> 1:50:56.940
 or a murderer a murderer.

1:50:56.940 --> 1:50:59.940
 But you know, if we can pinpoint the problem

1:50:59.940 --> 1:51:02.940
 and take care of it before, you know what I mean?

1:51:02.940 --> 1:51:05.940
 Or made it in a way that we can reestablish

1:51:05.940 --> 1:51:08.940
 that person in the society, you know?

1:51:08.940 --> 1:51:11.940
 Who knows, you know, what was the future's old?

1:51:11.940 --> 1:51:14.940
 It's interesting. We live in an interesting time.

1:51:14.940 --> 1:51:16.940
 You mentioned your father.

1:51:16.940 --> 1:51:19.940
 What have you learned from your dad?

1:51:19.940 --> 1:51:21.940
 You mentioned he was an important part of your childhood.

1:51:21.940 --> 1:51:24.940
 My dad is amazing.

1:51:24.940 --> 1:51:26.940
 I grew up, we didn't have a lot of money,

1:51:26.940 --> 1:51:28.940
 but it doesn't mean if I'm born in a nice country

1:51:28.940 --> 1:51:31.940
 that always nice thing happened, you know?

1:51:31.940 --> 1:51:35.940
 My dad, for me, is a big role model

1:51:35.940 --> 1:51:41.940
 because I see him through my life facing a lot of adversity.

1:51:41.940 --> 1:51:44.940
 You know, he stopped drinking when I was a teenager.

1:51:44.940 --> 1:51:46.940
 He was an alcoholic.

1:51:46.940 --> 1:51:50.940
 And I've seen him struggle through that, you know?

1:51:50.940 --> 1:51:52.940
 And it was very, very hard.

1:51:52.940 --> 1:51:59.940
 And I've seen him work like crazy hours,

1:51:59.940 --> 1:52:03.940
 like leave in the morning, come home at night,

1:52:03.940 --> 1:52:07.940
 burned out because of work through almost all his life.

1:52:07.940 --> 1:52:13.940
 To the point that it became a slave of the system.

1:52:13.940 --> 1:52:17.940
 It became an habit and a normal way of living.

1:52:17.940 --> 1:52:21.940
 And it made me realize that I've learned a lot through my father.

1:52:21.940 --> 1:52:25.940
 He taught me perseverance, hard work, you know?

1:52:25.940 --> 1:52:27.940
 When you face adversity, you know,

1:52:27.940 --> 1:52:30.940
 to never give up until you achieve it.

1:52:30.940 --> 1:52:35.940
 But also, he taught me a lesson that in a way

1:52:35.940 --> 1:52:37.940
 that I don't want to be like him.

1:52:37.940 --> 1:52:41.940
 Even if he is happy, it's because I realize

1:52:41.940 --> 1:52:43.940
 I don't think he knows anything else.

1:52:43.940 --> 1:52:46.940
 Like he works through all his life.

1:52:46.940 --> 1:52:49.940
 And I don't want to live to work.

1:52:49.940 --> 1:52:51.940
 I want to work for, you know what I mean?

1:52:51.940 --> 1:52:53.940
 I want to decide when I work, you know?

1:52:53.940 --> 1:52:59.940
 I feel like he lived to work instead of working for a living.

1:52:59.940 --> 1:53:03.940
 And perhaps it's because he did not have choice.

1:53:03.940 --> 1:53:05.940
 He was the older of his family.

1:53:05.940 --> 1:53:07.940
 They were nine kids.

1:53:07.940 --> 1:53:09.940
 My grandfather died when he was young.

1:53:09.940 --> 1:53:12.940
 So he had to become the father of the family

1:53:12.940 --> 1:53:15.940
 and work to put money on the table.

1:53:15.940 --> 1:53:19.940
 So perhaps that made him that way.

1:53:19.940 --> 1:53:23.940
 And he became like an habit for him.

1:53:23.940 --> 1:53:26.940
 My dad taught me when I was at school,

1:53:26.940 --> 1:53:28.940
 I was bullied at school.

1:53:28.940 --> 1:53:31.940
 He's the first one who initiated me to martial art.

1:53:31.940 --> 1:53:33.940
 He taught me karate.

1:53:33.940 --> 1:53:36.940
 My dad was a black belt in Kyoko Shinkari as well.

1:53:36.940 --> 1:53:38.940
 But because he was working too much,

1:53:38.940 --> 1:53:40.940
 he didn't have time to teach me.

1:53:40.940 --> 1:53:45.940
 And I needed self defense in order to defend myself.

1:53:45.940 --> 1:53:48.940
 I have a winning, a great career in mixed martial art,

1:53:48.940 --> 1:53:56.940
 but in the schoolyard, my record is not very good.

1:53:56.940 --> 1:54:02.940
 When you're a kid and you're about seven, eight years old

1:54:02.940 --> 1:54:09.940
 and you're facing bullies that are two to three years older

1:54:09.940 --> 1:54:12.940
 than yourself, it's not the same thing

1:54:12.940 --> 1:54:14.940
 than when you're 25 and the guy is 28.

1:54:14.940 --> 1:54:20.940
 So there is a big discrepancy in terms of maturity.

1:54:20.940 --> 1:54:25.940
 So my dad introduced me to karate.

1:54:25.940 --> 1:54:28.940
 Then he didn't have time to teach me.

1:54:28.940 --> 1:54:33.940
 Then he put me in a school with a teacher.

1:54:33.940 --> 1:54:36.940
 It was Jean Couture.

1:54:36.940 --> 1:54:39.940
 And I grew up with a lot of anger.

1:54:39.940 --> 1:54:44.940
 And there were two persons that was afraid growing up.

1:54:44.940 --> 1:54:45.940
 It was my dad.

1:54:45.940 --> 1:54:48.940
 My dad was very severe, very strict with me.

1:54:48.940 --> 1:54:53.940
 And I'm glad he was because I could have become very bad.

1:54:53.940 --> 1:54:56.940
 I could have become chosen on a different path.

1:54:56.940 --> 1:54:58.940
 People see me as a nice guy.

1:54:58.940 --> 1:54:59.940
 I am a nice guy.

1:54:59.940 --> 1:55:01.940
 I tried to be a good role model,

1:55:01.940 --> 1:55:05.940
 but I could easily have turned towards our own path.

1:55:05.940 --> 1:55:07.940
 There's darkness somewhere in there.

1:55:07.940 --> 1:55:09.940
 Yes, there are a lot.

1:55:09.940 --> 1:55:11.940
 And a lot of my friends have chosen that path.

1:55:11.940 --> 1:55:18.940
 And unfortunately, they are not with me today.

1:55:18.940 --> 1:55:20.940
 Even if I'm from Canada,

1:55:20.940 --> 1:55:23.940
 and Canada seems like the nicest country in the world.

1:55:23.940 --> 1:55:26.940
 Like I said, even if you live in a nice country,

1:55:26.940 --> 1:55:29.940
 not always nice thing, it depends on the situation.

1:55:29.940 --> 1:55:31.940
 But that's what my dad taught me.

1:55:31.940 --> 1:55:38.940
 And he gave me that because I'm very good at learning

1:55:38.940 --> 1:55:40.940
 by observing people.

1:55:40.940 --> 1:55:44.940
 And by observing him, I see the struggle he had with alcoholism

1:55:44.940 --> 1:55:46.940
 and what he did, the pain,

1:55:46.940 --> 1:55:50.940
 sometimes that he inflicted to us, to my family.

1:55:50.940 --> 1:55:56.940
 But how he turned, he did a 180 degree.

1:55:56.940 --> 1:55:58.940
 And I really admire that.

1:55:58.940 --> 1:56:02.940
 And I know it was very, very hard for him and he did it.

1:56:02.940 --> 1:56:06.940
 For me, that's a great role model for me.

1:56:06.940 --> 1:56:10.940
 So your dad being an engine of basically hard work

1:56:10.940 --> 1:56:14.940
 and you finding a balance of being able to work your ass off,

1:56:14.940 --> 1:56:17.940
 but also to be able to enjoy a piece of chocolate.

1:56:17.940 --> 1:56:23.940
 What is the perfect day in the life of George St. Pierre look like?

1:56:23.940 --> 1:56:27.940
 So like, if you were to go through a day that's very productive

1:56:27.940 --> 1:56:30.940
 but also one that makes you sit back and enjoy

1:56:30.940 --> 1:56:32.940
 and say, that was a good day.

1:56:32.940 --> 1:56:33.940
 What's that look like?

1:56:33.940 --> 1:56:34.940
 What are we talking about?

1:56:34.940 --> 1:56:35.940
 When do you wake up?

1:56:35.940 --> 1:56:37.940
 What do you eat?

1:56:37.940 --> 1:56:38.940
 What do you do?

1:56:38.940 --> 1:56:39.940
 It changed over the years.

1:56:39.940 --> 1:56:41.940
 When I was younger, I had a good day.

1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:43.940
 It was like a good training session

1:56:43.940 --> 1:56:46.940
 or achieving good thing in my training.

1:56:46.940 --> 1:56:48.940
 And that's why I was very good at it

1:56:48.940 --> 1:56:51.940
 because when I was obsessed,

1:56:51.940 --> 1:56:55.940
 I think to be good at something, you need to become obsessed.

1:56:55.940 --> 1:57:00.940
 And to me, performing in my training was everything.

1:57:00.940 --> 1:57:03.940
 When I had a bad training session,

1:57:03.940 --> 1:57:05.940
 I didn't tell my training partner.

1:57:05.940 --> 1:57:07.940
 I was acting like because of my ego.

1:57:07.940 --> 1:57:09.940
 I didn't tell nobody.

1:57:09.940 --> 1:57:13.940
 I was like, hey, then I go in the locker room.

1:57:13.940 --> 1:57:19.940
 Then I'm playing the training in my mind.

1:57:19.940 --> 1:57:21.940
 I'm saying, I should have done this, should have done that.

1:57:21.940 --> 1:57:25.940
 And it haunts me, it haunts me, man, it's a training.

1:57:25.940 --> 1:57:28.940
 And it haunts me until the next training session

1:57:28.940 --> 1:57:30.940
 when I can redeem myself.

1:57:30.940 --> 1:57:32.940
 That's how it is.

1:57:32.940 --> 1:57:38.940
 When we used to train all together back in the day,

1:57:38.940 --> 1:57:41.940
 in Canada, we had David Loiseau.

1:57:41.940 --> 1:57:43.940
 We had Patrick Côté.

1:57:43.940 --> 1:57:48.940
 We had Dennis Gang, Steve Vigno, Jean Attangoulay.

1:57:48.940 --> 1:57:51.940
 There was all like the best guy in Canada

1:57:51.940 --> 1:57:53.940
 that were training with each other.

1:57:53.940 --> 1:57:57.940
 We were training in different gyms, but once a week,

1:57:57.940 --> 1:58:00.940
 I made it in a way that I contact everybody

1:58:00.940 --> 1:58:03.940
 that we all joined force and we exchanged ideas

1:58:03.940 --> 1:58:05.940
 and we trained with each other.

1:58:05.940 --> 1:58:08.940
 I would say friendly competition.

1:58:08.940 --> 1:58:12.940
 It was not malicious, but it was hard training.

1:58:12.940 --> 1:58:16.940
 Our goal was to improve, but it wasn't very competitive.

1:58:16.940 --> 1:58:20.940
 And when that day you used to get out of the training session

1:58:20.940 --> 1:58:22.940
 with a bad performance for me,

1:58:22.940 --> 1:58:25.940
 it used to haunt me until the following week

1:58:25.940 --> 1:58:28.940
 when I could give it back and perform better

1:58:28.940 --> 1:58:31.940
 with the guy that I had the most trouble with.

1:58:31.940 --> 1:58:33.940
 That's how it was.

1:58:33.940 --> 1:58:35.940
 And that's how you get better.

1:58:35.940 --> 1:58:40.940
 But it was not a training where we were trying to do

1:58:40.940 --> 1:58:42.940
 malicious things to one another.

1:58:42.940 --> 1:58:44.940
 You know what I mean?

1:58:44.940 --> 1:58:48.940
 You need to be playful, but playful, but competitive.

1:58:48.940 --> 1:58:50.940
 That when I had a good training session

1:58:50.940 --> 1:58:52.940
 because the sparring was on a Friday,

1:58:52.940 --> 1:58:54.940
 I had the best weekend in the world.

1:58:54.940 --> 1:58:56.940
 I was going out with my friend, drinking and partying

1:58:56.940 --> 1:58:58.940
 and having fun.

1:58:58.940 --> 1:59:04.940
 That was my ideal day back in the day.

1:59:04.940 --> 1:59:06.940
 Today is change.

1:59:06.940 --> 1:59:09.940
 You know, my life has changed.

1:59:09.940 --> 1:59:15.940
 I am not the same person I used to be

1:59:15.940 --> 1:59:19.940
 when I went on my knees and begged the UFC for a title shot.

1:59:19.940 --> 1:59:21.940
 You know what I mean?

1:59:21.940 --> 1:59:23.940
 I'm wealthy.

1:59:23.940 --> 1:59:25.940
 I'm healthy, most importantly.

1:59:25.940 --> 1:59:27.940
 That's the most important thing.

1:59:27.940 --> 1:59:30.940
 And I'm going to tell you the truth.

1:59:30.940 --> 1:59:33.940
 As good as my career was,

1:59:33.940 --> 1:59:38.940
 man, my private life is a million time better.

1:59:38.940 --> 1:59:42.940
 And people ask me, sometimes they always wonder,

1:59:42.940 --> 1:59:44.940
 they try to ask me.

1:59:44.940 --> 1:59:46.940
 And it's normal.

1:59:46.940 --> 1:59:48.940
 A lot of people are curious.

1:59:48.940 --> 1:59:53.940
 And in the sport of mixed martial arts,

1:59:53.940 --> 1:59:56.940
 we say we play basketball, we play soccer,

1:59:56.940 --> 1:59:58.940
 but we don't play fighting.

1:59:58.940 --> 2:00:01.940
 So when you expose your private life,

2:00:01.940 --> 2:00:03.940
 we've seen that happen in the fight with

2:00:03.940 --> 2:00:05.940
 sometimes Conor McGregor and Khabib.

2:00:05.940 --> 2:00:08.940
 Your competitor knows that he cannot get to you,

2:00:08.940 --> 2:00:12.940
 so what he will do, he will try to get to someone that you love.

2:00:12.940 --> 2:00:15.940
 So I never expose my private life.

2:00:15.940 --> 2:00:19.940
 I never post Instagram of my family or my stuff.

2:00:19.940 --> 2:00:21.940
 That's the reason why.

2:00:21.940 --> 2:00:25.940
 Because I'm in a business of fighting.

2:00:25.940 --> 2:00:28.940
 And people know that they cannot get to me.

2:00:28.940 --> 2:00:34.940
 And I believe that because I was bullied when I was young,

2:00:34.940 --> 2:00:38.940
 I didn't realize that when I was young.

2:00:38.940 --> 2:00:42.940
 But it helps me deal with the mental warfare

2:00:42.940 --> 2:00:45.940
 that I had to face right now in my life in mixed martial arts

2:00:45.940 --> 2:00:47.940
 because it's a very ego test export.

2:00:47.940 --> 2:00:52.940
 And there's a lot of intimidation.

2:00:52.940 --> 2:00:56.940
 And I was used to, I've been used to this thing when I was young.

2:00:56.940 --> 2:00:58.940
 So it does not get to me.

2:00:58.940 --> 2:01:01.940
 However, the good way to get to me,

2:01:01.940 --> 2:01:06.940
 go try to get to someone I love.

2:01:06.940 --> 2:01:09.940
 Now, man, I'm gonna go crazy.

2:01:09.940 --> 2:01:10.940
 You know what I mean?

2:01:10.940 --> 2:01:11.940
 And I'm aware of that.

2:01:11.940 --> 2:01:13.940
 So in order to protect myself,

2:01:13.940 --> 2:01:17.940
 I always, because I'm aware I'm a public person.

2:01:17.940 --> 2:01:22.940
 So I try to always keep my surrounding in the private.

2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:28.940
 One of the ways that your friend of mine, Joe Rogan,

2:01:28.940 --> 2:01:33.940
 has been an inspiration that he's got like an incredible family.

2:01:33.940 --> 2:01:35.940
 And he, for the most part, it started to change recently.

2:01:35.940 --> 2:01:36.940
 Actually, it's kind of interesting.

2:01:36.940 --> 2:01:40.940
 But for the most part throughout his life, he kept it pretty secret.

2:01:40.940 --> 2:01:41.940
 Doesn't talk about it in his calm.

2:01:41.940 --> 2:01:42.940
 He's a comedian.

2:01:42.940 --> 2:01:43.940
 Comedians talk about everything.

2:01:43.940 --> 2:01:45.940
 He doesn't really talk about it.

2:01:45.940 --> 2:01:47.940
 And there's something to that.

2:01:47.940 --> 2:01:51.940
 It preserves the magic of the silence of the private life.

2:01:51.940 --> 2:01:56.940
 And I think it can affect the development of the kid.

2:01:56.940 --> 2:02:01.940
 If the kid grew up being, oh, he's the son of that guy

2:02:01.940 --> 2:02:03.940
 instead of being his own person.

2:02:03.940 --> 2:02:04.940
 You know what I mean?

2:02:04.940 --> 2:02:07.940
 So for me, it's very important.

2:02:07.940 --> 2:02:09.940
 Like, my parents are older.

2:02:09.940 --> 2:02:10.940
 It's fine.

2:02:10.940 --> 2:02:12.940
 But it taught me a big lesson.

2:02:12.940 --> 2:02:15.940
 When I'm with my friend at the dinner or anything,

2:02:15.940 --> 2:02:17.940
 I talk with the person or we share a thing.

2:02:17.940 --> 2:02:22.940
 But when I'm talking, I'm aware of the audience where I'm in front.

2:02:22.940 --> 2:02:23.940
 Yeah.

2:02:23.940 --> 2:02:25.940
 But oftentimes those people are just incredible.

2:02:25.940 --> 2:02:29.940
 It kind of makes me sad that, you know,

2:02:29.940 --> 2:02:30.940
 there's a lot of people that love you, right?

2:02:30.940 --> 2:02:32.940
 And there are a lot of really incredible people.

2:02:32.940 --> 2:02:35.940
 And you'll never get to really know their story.

2:02:35.940 --> 2:02:36.940
 I mean, I don't know.

2:02:36.940 --> 2:02:37.940
 For me, it makes me sad.

2:02:37.940 --> 2:02:39.940
 You see them like at airports and stuff.

2:02:39.940 --> 2:02:42.940
 People will tell me they listen to this podcast or something like that.

2:02:42.940 --> 2:02:45.940
 And I could tell they're incredible people.

2:02:45.940 --> 2:02:49.940
 And it makes me, it's like a little goodbye of a possible friend.

2:02:49.940 --> 2:02:50.940
 I don't know.

2:02:50.940 --> 2:02:51.940
 It makes me sad.

2:02:51.940 --> 2:02:54.940
 It makes me, it's lonely.

2:02:54.940 --> 2:02:57.940
 It's almost like celebrity is a lonely thing.

2:02:57.940 --> 2:03:01.940
 So the higher the celebrity, the more lonely you become in some kind of way.

2:03:01.940 --> 2:03:05.940
 But of course you have that little jam of a private life where you can...

2:03:05.940 --> 2:03:11.940
 Personally, I believe every relationship, I don't like to use this term,

2:03:11.940 --> 2:03:16.940
 but it's always a give and take relationship, you know?

2:03:16.940 --> 2:03:19.940
 Like you can gain something and the person...

2:03:19.940 --> 2:03:25.940
 It could be something like not materialistic, like something always a good, confident,

2:03:25.940 --> 2:03:29.940
 like someone that can give me good advice or...

2:03:29.940 --> 2:03:32.940
 It's a word I would say like extensional.

2:03:32.940 --> 2:03:38.940
 If a pilot has a copilot, the copilot has an extensional relationship with him.

2:03:38.940 --> 2:03:44.940
 He knows if he gets sick or he faint, he's there to make sure, he's there to help.

2:03:44.940 --> 2:03:49.940
 And I think in every relation, it's about compatibility, but it's about extensionality.

2:03:49.940 --> 2:03:50.940
 Right?

2:03:50.940 --> 2:03:53.940
 In a way that if that person is extensional.

2:03:53.940 --> 2:03:56.940
 And sometimes we talk about love, you know?

2:03:56.940 --> 2:04:00.940
 Like sometimes I think, is it a BS word or not?

2:04:00.940 --> 2:04:05.940
 Because I myself sometimes look at myself in the mirror.

2:04:05.940 --> 2:04:11.940
 And when I do stupid thing, sometimes I love myself a lot and sometimes I don't.

2:04:11.940 --> 2:04:12.940
 You know what I mean?

2:04:12.940 --> 2:04:16.940
 Because I'm angry at myself, I've done stupid thing.

2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:19.940
 So that means sometimes love could be fluctuating.

2:04:19.940 --> 2:04:20.940
 You know what I mean?

2:04:20.940 --> 2:04:24.940
 How about in relationships, sometimes people, they say they love each other,

2:04:24.940 --> 2:04:26.940
 but then when they divorce, they go,

2:04:26.940 --> 2:04:29.940
 Oh, I want the house and the dog and the kids stay with me.

2:04:29.940 --> 2:04:31.940
 And you know what I mean?

2:04:31.940 --> 2:04:36.940
 If you love, by definition, if you really love someone,

2:04:36.940 --> 2:04:41.940
 and let's say you're an old man and you love a woman and she decided to leave you for a younger man,

2:04:41.940 --> 2:04:46.940
 if you really love her, you're going to help her pack and leave.

2:04:46.940 --> 2:04:50.940
 But in our society sometimes we want to hone something.

2:04:50.940 --> 2:04:56.940
 To me, love includes the missing somebody, the losing somebody, the anger at somebody.

2:04:56.940 --> 2:04:59.940
 It's all the passion, feelings towards somebody.

2:04:59.940 --> 2:05:00.940
 That's all love.

2:05:00.940 --> 2:05:02.940
 Like I, you know, it's all part of the thing.

2:05:02.940 --> 2:05:04.940
 It's the ups and downs.

2:05:04.940 --> 2:05:10.940
 It's the sad thing is when the feelings towards a person, the ups and downs go away.

2:05:10.940 --> 2:05:11.940
 The forgetting.

2:05:11.940 --> 2:05:13.940
 That's the opposite of love.

2:05:13.940 --> 2:05:15.940
 So the opposite of love isn't hate.

2:05:15.940 --> 2:05:18.940
 To me, the opposite of love is forgetting.

2:05:18.940 --> 2:05:22.940
 And that's a much bigger, the depth of human connection.

2:05:22.940 --> 2:05:23.940
 That's how I see love.

2:05:23.940 --> 2:05:29.940
 So sometimes I try to stay positive and I've been asked how I try to,

2:05:29.940 --> 2:05:32.940
 because I have the image of someone who's positive,

2:05:32.940 --> 2:05:35.940
 but I go through my own demon as well sometimes.

2:05:35.940 --> 2:05:46.940
 However, when we talk about love, when I was young, you know, like, I didn't love who I was at first.

2:05:46.940 --> 2:05:47.940
 That's how I love.

2:05:47.940 --> 2:05:50.940
 I learned to kind of love myself.

2:05:50.940 --> 2:05:57.940
 Like when I was going through bullying, I believe I was bullied because I didn't love myself.

2:05:57.940 --> 2:06:03.940
 Because I project a very bad image of what I think of myself.

2:06:03.940 --> 2:06:05.940
 I was a kid that lacked a lot of confidence.

2:06:05.940 --> 2:06:07.940
 I was looking down when I was walking.

2:06:07.940 --> 2:06:09.940
 I shrugged my shoulder.

2:06:09.940 --> 2:06:13.940
 When someone was talking to me, I was avoiding eye contact.

2:06:13.940 --> 2:06:16.940
 So I was a very easy target for bullies.

2:06:16.940 --> 2:06:21.940
 And I think bullies are like predatory animal in nature.

2:06:21.940 --> 2:06:24.940
 They will hunt the easier prey.

2:06:24.940 --> 2:06:25.940
 They don't go.

2:06:25.940 --> 2:06:29.940
 The lion don't go for the half a bull.

2:06:29.940 --> 2:06:32.940
 They go for the one who's old or who's sick, the weakest one.

2:06:32.940 --> 2:06:35.940
 And bullies are the same in society, I believe.

2:06:35.940 --> 2:06:41.940
 And I didn't like to be bullied, of course, but I didn't like the person that I was.

2:06:41.940 --> 2:06:52.940
 But I found out to martial art, the respect, and my coach was extraordinary to me.

2:06:52.940 --> 2:06:55.940
 He taught me discipline and self strength.

2:06:55.940 --> 2:07:01.940
 And I found out that I needed to, in order to love myself, I needed to change myself.

2:07:01.940 --> 2:07:05.940
 Because when I looked at my son in the mirror, I didn't like what I saw.

2:07:05.940 --> 2:07:11.940
 So I decided to become like someone that I would love.

2:07:11.940 --> 2:07:23.940
 So I tried to look people straight up and trying to showcase a more confident image that I had.

2:07:23.940 --> 2:07:26.940
 And it was hard in the beginning because I didn't really believe in it.

2:07:26.940 --> 2:07:30.940
 But I faked it until I kind of make it.

2:07:30.940 --> 2:07:36.940
 So when I was walking at school, more and more, I was learning how to become more confident.

2:07:36.940 --> 2:07:39.940
 And I was like taking charge.

2:07:39.940 --> 2:07:41.940
 The teacher was asking questions.

2:07:41.940 --> 2:07:43.940
 At first, I was never answering.

2:07:43.940 --> 2:07:45.940
 I was like this, waiting always to be the last.

2:07:45.940 --> 2:07:48.940
 Then I was, hey, I know what the answer is.

2:07:48.940 --> 2:07:49.940
 This is the answer.

2:07:49.940 --> 2:07:54.940
 I got out of my comfort zone, so to speak.

2:07:54.940 --> 2:07:58.940
 And I wish I would tell you that I got out of bullying

2:07:58.940 --> 2:08:03.940
 because a Hollywood story, I use martial art to beat up all the bullies.

2:08:03.940 --> 2:08:05.940
 But it's not how it happened to me.

2:08:05.940 --> 2:08:09.940
 It happened because I changed myself from the inside out.

2:08:09.940 --> 2:08:15.940
 And I learned how to, because I didn't love myself in the beginning,

2:08:15.940 --> 2:08:20.940
 I learned how to become like someone that I love.

2:08:20.940 --> 2:08:26.940
 And even now, by no means perfect, I do a lot of stupid things.

2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:28.940
 But I learn as a person.

2:08:28.940 --> 2:08:30.940
 And even I do something stupid.

2:08:30.940 --> 2:08:32.940
 I'm like, shoot, I did something stupid.

2:08:32.940 --> 2:08:36.940
 At least I can apologize to the person if I realize.

2:08:36.940 --> 2:08:41.940
 And then I know that I'm not the person I was in the past.

2:08:41.940 --> 2:08:44.940
 I'm the person that I am right now.

2:08:44.940 --> 2:08:49.940
 So I can learn and become that image of the person that I love.

2:08:49.940 --> 2:08:52.940
 So in a way, the reason why I'm trying to be positive

2:08:52.940 --> 2:08:56.940
 and I'm able to stay positive sometime in life

2:08:56.940 --> 2:09:02.940
 is because I'm always trying to be like that person that I love.

2:09:02.940 --> 2:09:04.940
 And I think if you don't look yourself in the mirror

2:09:04.940 --> 2:09:09.940
 and don't love yourself or don't see any positive future for yourself,

2:09:09.940 --> 2:09:12.940
 how can you change your environment if you cannot change yourself?

2:09:12.940 --> 2:09:13.940
 You know what I mean?

2:09:13.940 --> 2:09:18.940
 You would never be happy if you're not happy when you look at yourself in the mirror.

2:09:18.940 --> 2:09:20.940
 So change yourself first, then change your...

2:09:20.940 --> 2:09:23.940
 You know, it's not the environment that's going to change for yourself.

2:09:23.940 --> 2:09:28.940
 You have to go from the inside out, you know?

2:09:28.940 --> 2:09:30.940
 This I learned to martial art.

2:09:30.940 --> 2:09:33.940
 I had a coach who was incredible.

2:09:33.940 --> 2:09:38.940
 He used to drill these ideas in my head and give me confidence, you know?

2:09:38.940 --> 2:09:42.940
 Like this telling me all these beautiful things about myself.

2:09:42.940 --> 2:09:46.940
 And now he's dead now, unfortunately, a piece to him.

2:09:46.940 --> 2:09:49.940
 But he was incredible, incredible.

2:09:49.940 --> 2:09:51.940
 He was very, very strict. I was afraid of him.

2:09:51.940 --> 2:09:53.940
 I was afraid of my dad and afraid of him.

2:09:53.940 --> 2:09:56.940
 He couldn't teach nowadays like he used to teach me

2:09:56.940 --> 2:09:59.940
 because he would be probably in jail, you know?

2:09:59.940 --> 2:10:04.940
 But I'm glad he did it because for that time being, that's what I needed.

2:10:04.940 --> 2:10:10.940
 And I would never have had that career I had in mixed martial art without this

2:10:10.940 --> 2:10:13.940
 because I would never have got out of my comfort zone.

2:10:13.940 --> 2:10:15.940
 It would have been impossible.

2:10:15.940 --> 2:10:18.940
 And in order to improve in life, you need to get out of your comfort zone.

2:10:18.940 --> 2:10:21.940
 It's hard. It's very hard to do.

2:10:21.940 --> 2:10:24.940
 And strive to be the person that you can love.

2:10:24.940 --> 2:10:27.940
 That's beautifully put, George.

2:10:27.940 --> 2:10:33.940
 If you were to give advice to a young person today about life, what would you tell him?

2:10:33.940 --> 2:10:42.940
 If he takes life with the same mentality that I do,

2:10:42.940 --> 2:10:48.940
 if he has the same taste of things that I have,

2:10:48.940 --> 2:10:54.940
 I would tell him, you know, for sport, for life in general,

2:10:54.940 --> 2:11:05.940
 I would say if you will have a dream, you know, like make everything in your power

2:11:05.940 --> 2:11:10.940
 and work very hard, you know, never take no for an answer

2:11:10.940 --> 2:11:14.940
 and go through hell in order to achieve it.

2:11:14.940 --> 2:11:21.940
 Don't work hard only but work smart.

2:11:21.940 --> 2:11:25.940
 That's, I think, the problems with a lot of people.

2:11:25.940 --> 2:11:28.940
 They work hard. They can work hard. They burn themselves. They don't work smart.

2:11:28.940 --> 2:11:35.940
 Whether it is in science and business, they make bad choices

2:11:35.940 --> 2:11:42.940
 or they badly inform in sport how many guys I've seen ruin their career in the gyms.

2:11:42.940 --> 2:11:46.940
 They spar so hard. They ruin themselves in the gyms.

2:11:46.940 --> 2:11:49.940
 They leave their career in the gyms.

2:11:49.940 --> 2:11:53.940
 What I would say to, for example, because my field of expertise,

2:11:53.940 --> 2:12:01.940
 it's in sport of mixed martial art, I would say to a young kid,

2:12:01.940 --> 2:12:08.940
 make your training playful. You know, when you get ready for competition,

2:12:08.940 --> 2:12:16.940
 you need to try to recreate those elements that makes you go outside of your comfort zone.

2:12:16.940 --> 2:12:21.940
 But in every day's life in general, make your training playful.

2:12:21.940 --> 2:12:27.940
 Don't make it like a hardcore competition about who's winning, who's losing.

2:12:27.940 --> 2:12:38.940
 Make it playful so it will increase your, because you will not be afraid of getting hurt or losing.

2:12:38.940 --> 2:12:48.940
 You will be tempted to try more things and it will make you become more creative.

2:12:48.940 --> 2:12:52.940
 You know, that brings up another question about learning.

2:12:52.940 --> 2:13:00.940
 So you value knowledge and you're exceptional at basically being very good at learning

2:13:00.940 --> 2:13:04.940
 and figuring stuff out, new things or going deeper on the things you already know.

2:13:04.940 --> 2:13:09.940
 So what advice would you have for how to learn effectively?

2:13:09.940 --> 2:13:15.940
 How, you know, you say work smart. How do you figure this game out?

2:13:15.940 --> 2:13:23.940
 I believe the best way to learn is learning from other people's mistake.

2:13:23.940 --> 2:13:29.940
 However, I'm not perfect and I've learned from my mistakes as well.

2:13:29.940 --> 2:13:36.940
 And sometimes it took me a few mistakes to learn the same thing.

2:13:36.940 --> 2:13:50.940
 But especially in the sport of mixed martial art, because we're talking about the failure could have a very serious outcome on someone's life and well being.

2:13:50.940 --> 2:13:55.940
 So it's crucial to trying to learn from other people's mistakes.

2:13:55.940 --> 2:13:57.940
 Do you study others?

2:13:57.940 --> 2:14:12.940
 Every fight, I'm studying my opponent and I've studied myself as well to know what out my strength mix versus my opponent weaknesses.

2:14:12.940 --> 2:14:20.940
 And how can I make the fight go in a way that I'm taking my opponent outside of his comfort zone?

2:14:20.940 --> 2:14:26.940
 Very often people are good at studying their opponent, but they're not good at looking at themselves.

2:14:26.940 --> 2:14:33.940
 They're better at knowing what they should do in order to maximize their odds of success, right?

2:14:33.940 --> 2:14:46.940
 That's why I always thought, for me, it was important to not be the best at one thing, but be very good at everything.

2:14:46.940 --> 2:14:58.940
 That's why I always seek advice from the best in every discipline. I wrestle with the best wrestler I could be with.

2:14:58.940 --> 2:15:04.940
 I box with the best boxers. I practice karate with the best karate fighters.

2:15:04.940 --> 2:15:09.940
 Same thing in jujitsu. I train jujitsu with the best jujitsu guys.

2:15:09.940 --> 2:15:18.940
 However, when I mix everything and mix martial art, because I'm very competent in every area.

2:15:18.940 --> 2:15:26.940
 So when I'm fighting someone, I'm very good at identifying where he's the less competent.

2:15:26.940 --> 2:15:36.940
 And I know for a fact that because I'm competent everywhere, if I can bring the fight where he's outside of his comfort zone, it increases my odds of winning.

2:15:36.940 --> 2:15:43.940
 There's no certainty. It's all about odds, I believe, because there is always an X factor that you do not control.

2:15:43.940 --> 2:15:48.940
 Yeah, it's fascinating to see you, actually, because you've been a student of movement.

2:15:48.940 --> 2:15:52.940
 You've been exploring all kinds of gymnastics, all that kind of stuff.

2:15:52.940 --> 2:16:02.940
 There's something reminiscent to, like, Conor McGregor is one other martial artist that's kind of explored movement, been a scholar of movement.

2:16:02.940 --> 2:16:11.940
 At least from my perspective, it's very sort of Bruce Lee, like, it's almost making a study of the human body and all the possible things you can do.

2:16:11.940 --> 2:16:14.940
 Is there a philosophy behind that that you have?

2:16:14.940 --> 2:16:24.940
 You talk about Bruce Lee, man. He changes my life, too. He was ahead of his time.

2:16:24.940 --> 2:16:26.940
 Yeah, incredible.

2:16:26.940 --> 2:16:32.940
 A lot of people talk to me and ask me, hey, is Bruce Lee would have been able to fight in UFC?

2:16:32.940 --> 2:16:38.940
 Look, I don't think so. I don't know. I think he was a martial artist.

2:16:38.940 --> 2:16:44.940
 He could have defended himself, but to say that he could have competed amongst the elite of the elite fighter.

2:16:44.940 --> 2:16:54.940
 Perhaps in his time, but for sure, if you put him in UFC right now, the sport has improved incredibly since then.

2:16:54.940 --> 2:16:59.940
 But in terms of philosophy, Bruce Lee was amazing.

2:16:59.940 --> 2:17:07.940
 One thing, just to prove that he was ahead of his time, he was talking about using your longest weapon against your opponent nearest point.

2:17:07.940 --> 2:17:16.940
 And we see that kick that got popularized by John Jones, you know, the sidekick to the tie.

2:17:16.940 --> 2:17:25.940
 The longest weapon against your nearest point. And boxing is the jab, but in MMA, when you can use all your weapon, that's the kick to the tie.

2:17:25.940 --> 2:17:31.940
 And there is, I felt there is like kind of three dimension in martial art.

2:17:31.940 --> 2:17:38.940
 There is the philosopher like Bruce Lee. There is the choreography, the choreograph people.

2:17:38.940 --> 2:17:49.940
 Like, for example, you see in movies, the stunt people, they're incredible. Or the one that does forms and karate, like jumping, spin, kick, bad kick, like a crumbatic stuff.

2:17:49.940 --> 2:17:56.940
 Mixed martial art, they are unbelievable. And there is also the one that competed in fighting.

2:17:56.940 --> 2:18:00.940
 That's what I do. I personally specialize in.

2:18:00.940 --> 2:18:02.940
 Well, you also do the philosophy.

2:18:02.940 --> 2:18:07.940
 I do a little bit of philosophy, but that's a consequence of the fighting.

2:18:07.940 --> 2:18:19.940
 I guess we are all like, we all practice the three dimension because martial art is, I would say it's, whether you want it or not, you have to touch these three dimensions.

2:18:19.940 --> 2:18:27.940
 But you will specialize in one. I specialize through my life in fighting, like the real thing in terms of fighting, competition.

2:18:27.940 --> 2:18:32.940
 And of course, if you do martial art, you will be able to defend yourself because it's a self defense.

2:18:32.940 --> 2:18:38.940
 However, you might not be able to fight as an elite and the most prestigious organization.

2:18:38.940 --> 2:18:48.940
 And you might not be able to perform the stunt that, for example, the stuntmen that have done in the series I was playing in the Falcon and Winter Soldier.

2:18:48.940 --> 2:18:53.940
 These guys are incredible. They're like real life superhero things they do.

2:18:53.940 --> 2:18:57.940
 To me, like, it's fascinating. It's amazing.

2:18:57.940 --> 2:19:00.940
 And also Bruce Lee, the philosophy.

2:19:00.940 --> 2:19:06.940
 How many hours he took thinking about these stuff?

2:19:06.940 --> 2:19:14.940
 I'm sure he did not just came out of nowhere. He was thinking. That's mean he slept on this.

2:19:14.940 --> 2:19:17.940
 How many hours? It just unbelievable.

2:19:17.940 --> 2:19:23.940
 He's like water, my friend. How many times has he thought about water going to bed before he said that?

2:19:23.940 --> 2:19:33.940
 Let me ask a very important fundamental question about martial arts. We're both wearing a suit and tie. Joe Rogan thinks that wearing a tie is a huge disadvantage.

2:19:33.940 --> 2:19:36.940
 Is it a clip on or is it an actual tie?

2:19:36.940 --> 2:19:38.940
 It's an actual tie.

2:19:38.940 --> 2:19:50.940
 So do you agree or disagree with Joe Rogan that wearing a tie is a martial arts significant disadvantage in terms of combat in a combat scenario?

2:19:50.940 --> 2:19:54.940
 In a fight, I think it would be a disadvantage.

2:19:54.940 --> 2:20:01.940
 I work as a security bouncer in nightclubs and event when I was 18 years old.

2:20:01.940 --> 2:20:08.940
 And sometimes I had to work in certain event that I was in suit and tie.

2:20:08.940 --> 2:20:16.940
 I never had to use my force to take someone out when I was in suit and tie.

2:20:16.940 --> 2:20:26.940
 But if I would have had to before going to the table to physically take the guy out, I would have removed my tie and I would have removed my vest for sure.

2:20:26.940 --> 2:20:28.940
 And I would have called back up for sure.

2:20:28.940 --> 2:20:34.940
 And I would have probably used the element of surprise to be first on the guy.

2:20:34.940 --> 2:20:45.940
 When you're in a bar, same thing. You call back up first and you make sure you ask the waitress before to clean the table before you go.

2:20:45.940 --> 2:20:49.940
 And when you go, you have to use the element of surprise.

2:20:49.940 --> 2:20:55.940
 Because fighting and mixed martial arts and fighting in the street, it's two different things.

2:20:55.940 --> 2:20:59.940
 And yes, I'm a mixed martial arts competitor.

2:20:59.940 --> 2:21:03.940
 That's what I've done all my life, but I had a lot of street fighting in my life.

2:21:03.940 --> 2:21:04.940
 A lot when I was in...

2:21:04.940 --> 2:21:05.940
 What's the difference?

2:21:05.940 --> 2:21:06.940
 What's like the...

2:21:06.940 --> 2:21:08.940
 Oh my God, it's a huge difference.

2:21:08.940 --> 2:21:19.940
 It's the guys that, if I would have a choice to fight, for example, certain guys in UFC in a street fight and fight other guys that are not in UFC,

2:21:19.940 --> 2:21:23.940
 I would maybe sometimes pick guys that are not in UFC, not necessarily.

2:21:23.940 --> 2:21:27.940
 Because in the street fight, there's no referee that says go.

2:21:27.940 --> 2:21:29.940
 It's the element of surprise.

2:21:29.940 --> 2:21:34.940
 And when you're a nice guy, you're not the aggressor, you always have the element of surprise.

2:21:34.940 --> 2:21:35.940
 That's what it taught me.

2:21:35.940 --> 2:21:36.940
 Oh, interesting.

2:21:36.940 --> 2:21:38.940
 Yes, because if...

2:21:38.940 --> 2:21:40.940
 Aggression or sacrifice seems a surprise.

2:21:40.940 --> 2:21:43.940
 The person will not come punch you without warning.

2:21:43.940 --> 2:21:46.940
 It needs to trigger something.

2:21:46.940 --> 2:21:48.940
 It's something that needs to be triggered before.

2:21:48.940 --> 2:21:55.940
 So if someone comes because he's looking for trouble, there's a sign that he's looking for trouble.

2:21:55.940 --> 2:21:59.940
 So I was just talking with Bass Root and this weekend about it.

2:21:59.940 --> 2:22:00.940
 I saw that.

2:22:00.940 --> 2:22:03.940
 Every martial art comes from...

2:22:03.940 --> 2:22:07.940
 Some martial art are from Exclusivik for competition.

2:22:07.940 --> 2:22:11.940
 Like sport karate, certain martial art.

2:22:11.940 --> 2:22:16.940
 But traditional martial art are for the street or for self defense.

2:22:16.940 --> 2:22:19.940
 And I start my background in Kyoko Shin Karate.

2:22:19.940 --> 2:22:20.940
 So it's for...

2:22:20.940 --> 2:22:21.940
 And I did Japanese Jujitsu.

2:22:21.940 --> 2:22:28.940
 So my background, before I even start training for mixed martial art, my background is in self defense.

2:22:28.940 --> 2:22:34.940
 And it's very important to understand that in a street fight, the element of surprise is everything.

2:22:34.940 --> 2:22:35.940
 And there are no rules.

2:22:35.940 --> 2:22:38.940
 You can't go for the eyes, the neck, the...

2:22:38.940 --> 2:22:39.940
 It surprises everything.

2:22:39.940 --> 2:22:42.940
 It's a total ball game, you know what I mean?

2:22:42.940 --> 2:22:47.940
 You have the chair, the beard, there's so much more thing going on.

2:22:47.940 --> 2:22:49.940
 So the idea of...

2:22:49.940 --> 2:22:52.940
 Because you are a UFC fighter, you think you're invincible.

2:22:52.940 --> 2:22:54.940
 This is BS.

2:22:54.940 --> 2:22:55.940
 Anybody can come.

2:22:55.940 --> 2:22:59.940
 Like if a big guy who punch very hard, most people don't know how to punch.

2:22:59.940 --> 2:23:02.940
 By the way, they don't know how to make a fist and throw it in a forward direction.

2:23:02.940 --> 2:23:05.940
 But if someone knows how to do it, I don't care who you are.

2:23:05.940 --> 2:23:09.940
 If you could be Francis and Genu, someone come behind your head and...

2:23:09.940 --> 2:23:13.940
 Or let's say there's an argument and you get surprised by a punch.

2:23:13.940 --> 2:23:15.940
 You can't be dropped and lose a fight.

2:23:15.940 --> 2:23:16.940
 It doesn't matter.

2:23:16.940 --> 2:23:19.940
 The element of surprise is everything.

2:23:19.940 --> 2:23:22.940
 So you were saying remove all the sources of the elements of surprise.

2:23:22.940 --> 2:23:25.940
 Clear the bar, remove the tie.

2:23:25.940 --> 2:23:27.940
 I still disagree with you about the tab.

2:23:27.940 --> 2:23:36.940
 And just for your information, if someone comes looking for trouble and you see me do this...

2:23:36.940 --> 2:23:41.940
 And going sideways a little bit, that's my position that I'm thinking.

2:23:41.940 --> 2:23:42.940
 There you go.

2:23:42.940 --> 2:23:44.940
 Maybe something will happen and I'm about...

2:23:44.940 --> 2:23:45.940
 That's a good...

2:23:45.940 --> 2:23:47.940
 I'm about thinking about doing the element.

2:23:47.940 --> 2:23:51.940
 I'm about to punch you or to do something to take care of this.

2:23:51.940 --> 2:23:57.940
 See, to flip the table on you then, wearing a tie is communicating the nice guy image.

2:23:57.940 --> 2:24:02.940
 So it actually gives you the freedom for more elements of surprise by wearing the tie.

2:24:02.940 --> 2:24:07.940
 If you take it off, that's more you're limiting your options.

2:24:07.940 --> 2:24:10.940
 Because nobody's going to expect the guy in the tie to do anything.

2:24:10.940 --> 2:24:17.940
 I'm a big believer that sometimes it's not only materialism, it's what you project.

2:24:17.940 --> 2:24:18.940
 That's true.

2:24:18.940 --> 2:24:22.940
 Like I said, I had troubles in a bar and I was able to deflect.

2:24:22.940 --> 2:24:27.940
 The guy was looking for trouble talking to me and I was able to deflect his own aggressivity

2:24:27.940 --> 2:24:30.940
 by saying like, hey man, that's a nice shirt.

2:24:30.940 --> 2:24:31.940
 Where did you get it?

2:24:31.940 --> 2:24:34.940
 Like saying like something was stupid like this.

2:24:34.940 --> 2:24:40.940
 Then it kind of break the momentum and he, you know, but the guy was looking for trouble.

2:24:40.940 --> 2:24:41.940
 I don't want to fight you.

2:24:41.940 --> 2:24:46.940
 I don't want to fight you, but I'm not going to wait until you pull.

2:24:46.940 --> 2:24:52.940
 You make the first move because the minute you touch me, you push me or you touch me,

2:24:52.940 --> 2:24:55.940
 you declare war and the war is unleashed, my friend.

2:24:55.940 --> 2:25:00.940
 And I'm taking you out of order with the necessary force, of course.

2:25:00.940 --> 2:25:01.940
 You know what I mean?

2:25:01.940 --> 2:25:04.940
 That's the thing with martial art.

2:25:04.940 --> 2:25:08.940
 If you use the necessary force to take out a problem, it's okay.

2:25:08.940 --> 2:25:14.940
 But if you, you know, you take advantage of it, that's when it's not all right because it's a weapon.

2:25:14.940 --> 2:25:17.940
 So if someone comes up to me, that's my position.

2:25:17.940 --> 2:25:20.940
 And now I'm assessing the situation.

2:25:20.940 --> 2:25:24.940
 You know, that's, that's how they teach in self defense here.

2:25:24.940 --> 2:25:25.940
 Never put your hands down.

2:25:25.940 --> 2:25:29.940
 I was in there because I'm down or boom.

2:25:29.940 --> 2:25:32.940
 Like what this is, this is very important.

2:25:32.940 --> 2:25:35.940
 And you never, you're always your center line on the side.

2:25:35.940 --> 2:25:36.940
 Yeah.

2:25:36.940 --> 2:25:37.940
 Like this.

2:25:37.940 --> 2:25:41.940
 If someone knows martial art, he will recognize that pattern.

2:25:41.940 --> 2:25:44.940
 But if you go like this, if someone talked to you and you go like this,

2:25:44.940 --> 2:25:47.940
 that's mean you're telling the guy that you want to fight.

2:25:47.940 --> 2:25:48.940
 You don't want to do that.

2:25:48.940 --> 2:25:49.940
 You don't want to, oh yeah.

2:25:49.940 --> 2:25:53.940
 That's, that's, that's, you know, that's, that's the position.

2:25:53.940 --> 2:25:57.940
 Cause your hand are here, you know, whatever you can do, you're here.

2:25:57.940 --> 2:25:59.940
 Well, also your ear tells a story.

2:25:59.940 --> 2:26:02.940
 It's not everybody that knows that.

2:26:02.940 --> 2:26:06.940
 However, some people might think that it's my mom grabbed me by the ear and pulled me

2:26:06.940 --> 2:26:08.940
 because I didn't listen to her, you know.

2:26:08.940 --> 2:26:13.940
 A real fight in the street and a fight in the mixed martial art is a different ballgame.

2:26:13.940 --> 2:26:17.940
 What do you think is the best martial art to prepare you for street fighting?

2:26:17.940 --> 2:26:20.940
 You know, people often kind of have this discussion of jiu jitsu,

2:26:20.940 --> 2:26:22.940
 maybe boxing, maybe wrestling.

2:26:22.940 --> 2:26:27.940
 Do you think we can talk about a young person studying martial arts to prepare themselves?

2:26:27.940 --> 2:26:33.940
 For a street fight, it's often much different than a mixed martial art fight.

2:26:33.940 --> 2:26:39.940
 And I know there's a lot of BS in the world of martial art, like self defense stuff.

2:26:39.940 --> 2:26:49.940
 But I believe self defense is very important in a way to understand the situation,

2:26:49.940 --> 2:26:57.940
 to understand those situations that might occur, how to deal with it.

2:26:57.940 --> 2:27:05.940
 Not necessarily that we talk about the technicality, we talk about the tacticality, the tactics, you know.

2:27:05.940 --> 2:27:08.940
 Like when I'm talking to you about the element of surprise, it's important.

2:27:08.940 --> 2:27:09.940
 This is not technique.

2:27:09.940 --> 2:27:18.940
 A technique is a punch or techniques that I physically will use to enable my opponent, my aggressor.

2:27:18.940 --> 2:27:22.940
 Tactic is the tactic I'm telling you about is in a street fight.

2:27:22.940 --> 2:27:28.940
 If someone is looking for trouble and I feel the heat rising as the conversation goes, that's the position I'm going to take.

2:27:28.940 --> 2:27:31.940
 And I have to be first.

2:27:31.940 --> 2:27:33.940
 I cannot let him go first.

2:27:33.940 --> 2:27:35.940
 So I have to strike first or do something.

2:27:35.940 --> 2:27:43.940
 This is the first thing that generally I have to agree on.

2:27:43.940 --> 2:27:46.940
 After that, of course, there's the knowledge.

2:27:46.940 --> 2:27:53.940
 If you're a professional fighter, you have a huge advantage once the fight has started, the war has declared.

2:27:53.940 --> 2:27:55.940
 Now everything goes.

2:27:55.940 --> 2:28:04.940
 But generally speaking, the person that will intervene physically, that will have the first blow or the first punch,

2:28:04.940 --> 2:28:07.940
 will have a huge disadvantage.

2:28:07.940 --> 2:28:10.940
 It's like doing a hundred meter raise and having a head start.

2:28:10.940 --> 2:28:14.940
 And that you can't prepare for with any martial art.

2:28:14.940 --> 2:28:17.940
 Yeah, and if I'm a smart guy, I know how to fight.

2:28:17.940 --> 2:28:26.940
 If a guy like an heavyweight champion comes to me, I know what to do to disable him.

2:28:26.940 --> 2:28:30.940
 Boom, or hair, or the neck.

2:28:30.940 --> 2:28:33.940
 If you blind him, what is he going to do?

2:28:33.940 --> 2:28:35.940
 You know what I mean?

2:28:35.940 --> 2:28:37.940
 Or a bottle, you know what I mean?

2:28:37.940 --> 2:28:40.940
 So the element of surprise is everything.

2:28:40.940 --> 2:28:45.940
 That's why it's always good to be the nice guy and not looking for trouble.

2:28:45.940 --> 2:28:48.940
 Because if you're not looking for trouble, you have the head start.

2:28:48.940 --> 2:28:50.940
 You have the option of having a head start.

2:28:50.940 --> 2:28:53.940
 So what you're saying is being a nice guy is the best form of self defense.

2:28:53.940 --> 2:28:55.940
 Maybe a little humor too.

2:28:55.940 --> 2:28:57.940
 You know how I have learned that?

2:28:57.940 --> 2:28:59.940
 I've learned that when I was a kid.

2:28:59.940 --> 2:29:03.940
 I was about maybe six, six years old.

2:29:03.940 --> 2:29:06.940
 We used to play in Montreal a lot of snow.

2:29:06.940 --> 2:29:08.940
 We used to play King of the Montaigne.

2:29:08.940 --> 2:29:11.940
 That's the first combat lesson that I've learned in my life.

2:29:11.940 --> 2:29:13.940
 And I managed somehow.

2:29:13.940 --> 2:29:14.940
 It was a lot of kids.

2:29:14.940 --> 2:29:16.940
 I managed to get on the top of the Montaigne.

2:29:16.940 --> 2:29:19.940
 And another guy came in on top of the Montaigne.

2:29:19.940 --> 2:29:23.940
 And he was angry that I was there before him.

2:29:23.940 --> 2:29:27.940
 When you play King of the Montaigne, it was a mountain of snow.

2:29:27.940 --> 2:29:29.940
 You don't strike each other.

2:29:29.940 --> 2:29:31.940
 You just wrestle and push.

2:29:31.940 --> 2:29:32.940
 And I managed to be first.

2:29:32.940 --> 2:29:37.940
 And when he came, he says to me, say, okay, you want to fight.

2:29:37.940 --> 2:29:39.940
 And I said, yeah, I don't know what it means.

2:29:39.940 --> 2:29:40.940
 Like I want to fight.

2:29:40.940 --> 2:29:41.940
 You want to wrestle.

2:29:41.940 --> 2:29:43.940
 He said, I say, yes.

2:29:43.940 --> 2:29:45.940
 He punched me right in the face.

2:29:45.940 --> 2:29:46.940
 Boom.

2:29:46.940 --> 2:29:49.940
 And then I fall on the bottom of the mountain.

2:29:49.940 --> 2:29:53.940
 Then when I fall down, I remember that vision in my life.

2:29:53.940 --> 2:29:57.940
 Because it's, I really remember that for the rest of my life.

2:29:57.940 --> 2:30:01.940
 I'm about to stand up and I see the blood coming out of my nose.

2:30:01.940 --> 2:30:05.940
 I see the snow is red because my nose is bleeding.

2:30:05.940 --> 2:30:10.940
 Now I remember the limit of surprises, everything.

2:30:10.940 --> 2:30:13.940
 My first street fight, I lost it.

2:30:13.940 --> 2:30:18.940
 I didn't get knocked out, but I got dropped on the bottom of the snow mountain.

2:30:18.940 --> 2:30:22.940
 And I was like, ah, you got me because I was not expecting my hand.

2:30:22.940 --> 2:30:24.940
 I was not expecting a punch.

2:30:24.940 --> 2:30:30.940
 So from there, when I felt the eat during an argument or something was not right,

2:30:30.940 --> 2:30:32.940
 I always stroke first.

2:30:32.940 --> 2:30:38.940
 I didn't win all my fight because sometimes there were more than one guys on me, you know.

2:30:38.940 --> 2:30:43.940
 But I think it's important to not be the aggressor.

2:30:43.940 --> 2:30:47.940
 So you have the element of surprise and always use that in your favor.

2:30:47.940 --> 2:30:48.940
 That's so brilliant.

2:30:48.940 --> 2:30:55.940
 Let me go from the very practical to the most impractically huge question about the meaning of life.

2:30:55.940 --> 2:31:04.940
 You said that when great depths of unrelenting sorrow are punctuated by great peaks of joy and liberation,

2:31:04.940 --> 2:31:06.940
 the result is delicious.

2:31:06.940 --> 2:31:13.940
 So what do you think is the meaning of this whole journey that we're on, this life?

2:31:13.940 --> 2:31:15.940
 What makes life delicious?

2:31:15.940 --> 2:31:22.940
 To me, you know, satisfaction is the end for me.

2:31:22.940 --> 2:31:28.940
 Like I always, if I'm satisfied, that's mean I have no nothing to live for.

2:31:28.940 --> 2:31:32.940
 I'm not talking only about my career, I'm talking about my life.

2:31:32.940 --> 2:31:34.940
 What do you want in your life?

2:31:34.940 --> 2:31:37.940
 You want kids, you want a family, you want to be champion.

2:31:37.940 --> 2:31:38.940
 What do you want in your life?

2:31:38.940 --> 2:31:44.940
 You have like a long term goal, short term goal.

2:31:44.940 --> 2:31:47.940
 In mixed martial art, I achieve what I needed to achieve.

2:31:47.940 --> 2:31:49.940
 I'm satisfied.

2:31:49.940 --> 2:31:54.940
 I'm no longer the same George Napierre than when I was begging for a title shot on my knees.

2:31:54.940 --> 2:31:58.940
 I move on from it.

2:31:58.940 --> 2:32:01.940
 Now I had the chance to go into movies.

2:32:01.940 --> 2:32:14.940
 Now that same insane drive that I had to be the champion in the world, now I put it into acting.

2:32:14.940 --> 2:32:20.940
 Like I'm having a lot of acting class now and luckily for me, the timing was amazing.

2:32:20.940 --> 2:32:26.940
 I got cast for the Falcon and the Winter Soldier that is on Disney Plus channel.

2:32:26.940 --> 2:32:34.940
 It's a huge, huge project to be part of for me because it's like you play basketball,

2:32:34.940 --> 2:32:36.940
 you have a chance to go for the NBA right away.

2:32:36.940 --> 2:32:38.940
 I was very lucky.

2:32:38.940 --> 2:32:40.940
 The timing was just too perfect.

2:32:40.940 --> 2:32:47.940
 And so you need to constantly challenging yourself and having goals to achieve.

2:32:47.940 --> 2:32:52.940
 You know, like keep your brain activated, like keep working.

2:32:52.940 --> 2:33:00.940
 And the proof of that is that you see sometimes some old people, like when they retire very often,

2:33:00.940 --> 2:33:06.940
 sometimes you see that they got sick and they die or because they...

2:33:06.940 --> 2:33:11.940
 It's either because sometimes we think we...

2:33:11.940 --> 2:33:19.940
 We do something good for them by making not work and giving them a break.

2:33:19.940 --> 2:33:22.940
 So in our mind, we're like, oh, he's going to be able to relax.

2:33:22.940 --> 2:33:26.940
 But in their mind, it's not good because they're not busy.

2:33:26.940 --> 2:33:27.940
 They have nothing to live for.

2:33:27.940 --> 2:33:32.940
 Like my dad is used to work all the time and he has always something to do.

2:33:32.940 --> 2:33:34.940
 He's retired now.

2:33:34.940 --> 2:33:38.940
 I myself now call him by force to find him some job.

2:33:38.940 --> 2:33:41.940
 Hey, dad, can you come in my house?

2:33:41.940 --> 2:33:43.940
 I have this thing to repair.

2:33:43.940 --> 2:33:44.940
 I don't know how to do it.

2:33:44.940 --> 2:33:49.940
 So it gives him a reason not to live on because he has other things to do.

2:33:49.940 --> 2:33:57.940
 But what I mean is also in life, I think you always don't be afraid to aim high.

2:33:57.940 --> 2:34:03.940
 Don't be afraid to fix your objective very high and never be able to reach it.

2:34:03.940 --> 2:34:05.940
 Be afraid of reaching your goals, essentially.

2:34:05.940 --> 2:34:07.940
 I mean, you always have to keep moving it out.

2:34:07.940 --> 2:34:09.940
 You think there's a...

2:34:09.940 --> 2:34:13.940
 It's an interesting question because you've been acting in some really exciting things.

2:34:13.940 --> 2:34:19.940
 Do you think there's a dramatic role where it's a basically...

2:34:19.940 --> 2:34:23.940
 You go full Robert De Niro and taxi driver.

2:34:23.940 --> 2:34:27.940
 Do you think there'll be a full length feature film with George St. Pierre?

2:34:27.940 --> 2:34:31.940
 There is level to this thing.

2:34:31.940 --> 2:34:34.940
 I'm aware that I have to restart as a white belt.

2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:37.940
 And for some people, it could be discouraging.

2:34:37.940 --> 2:34:39.940
 But for me, man, it's great.

2:34:39.940 --> 2:34:40.940
 I love it.

2:34:40.940 --> 2:34:41.940
 I freaking love it.

2:34:41.940 --> 2:34:46.940
 I embrace it because everybody told me like I would never be able to do it and it's fine.

2:34:46.940 --> 2:34:48.940
 But the...

2:34:48.940 --> 2:34:56.940
 And also the outcome of a failure in the sport of mixed martial art is much more serious

2:34:56.940 --> 2:35:00.940
 than the outcome of a failure for a movie, for example.

2:35:00.940 --> 2:35:03.940
 Or if you zig when you should zag in a fight, you get knocked out.

2:35:03.940 --> 2:35:05.940
 If you zig when you should zag in an unset...

2:35:05.940 --> 2:35:06.940
 Oh, cut.

2:35:06.940 --> 2:35:08.940
 We'll do it again.

2:35:08.940 --> 2:35:17.940
 And I know that I will be most likely be choosing for action martial art roles

2:35:17.940 --> 2:35:19.940
 because that's my background.

2:35:19.940 --> 2:35:21.940
 There is this new trend in Hollywood now.

2:35:21.940 --> 2:35:27.940
 When they want someone to play an Italian guy, they're going to choose a real Italian person.

2:35:27.940 --> 2:35:32.940
 When they want someone to play a Russian guy, they're going to choose someone who has a real Russian background.

2:35:32.940 --> 2:35:35.940
 Now they want a real martial art fighter.

2:35:35.940 --> 2:35:37.940
 I've done fighting all my life.

2:35:37.940 --> 2:35:40.940
 I just need to improve my acting skill.

2:35:40.940 --> 2:35:45.940
 But when I train in acting, I get myself out of my comfort zone.

2:35:45.940 --> 2:35:47.940
 I'm not playing a role of a martial art guy.

2:35:47.940 --> 2:35:51.940
 I'm playing like romance, comedy, drama.

2:35:51.940 --> 2:35:59.940
 So when I go unset and play the role of a badass martial art guy, it's easier.

2:35:59.940 --> 2:36:07.940
 So like in training for a fight, I always make my preparation harder than the actual task.

2:36:07.940 --> 2:36:09.940
 I would love to see where...

2:36:09.940 --> 2:36:12.940
 I don't know if you've seen The Wrestler with Mickey Work.

2:36:12.940 --> 2:36:13.940
 Oh, yeah.

2:36:13.940 --> 2:36:18.940
 Those types of films, I would love to do something like that.

2:36:18.940 --> 2:36:22.940
 If not now, then in 10, 20 years, I could see that.

2:36:22.940 --> 2:36:23.940
 That would be amazing.

2:36:23.940 --> 2:36:24.940
 There's levels to the game, right?

2:36:24.940 --> 2:36:25.940
 Yes, it's gradual.

2:36:25.940 --> 2:36:31.940
 And I'm aware that I don't want to take something on my shoulder that I won't be able to deliver.

2:36:31.940 --> 2:36:34.940
 It's like a fighter who wants to go for a title shot right away.

2:36:34.940 --> 2:36:37.940
 He could very well break him.

2:36:37.940 --> 2:36:42.940
 And I don't want to do that because I know I've done some gigs in the past,

2:36:42.940 --> 2:36:47.940
 but I was not focusing on it because I was focusing on competing as a martial art.

2:36:47.940 --> 2:36:50.940
 Martial art is in competition in MMA.

2:36:50.940 --> 2:36:52.940
 But now I take it very seriously.

2:36:52.940 --> 2:36:56.940
 So I cannot do the same mistake again because I've done some stuff.

2:36:56.940 --> 2:36:58.940
 I've done it for the money and it was good.

2:36:58.940 --> 2:37:03.940
 It was fun to be beat up by Jean Claude Van Damme, Steven Sego and everything,

2:37:03.940 --> 2:37:07.940
 but my acting was not on point at that time.

2:37:07.940 --> 2:37:13.940
 So every time I'm going to come back from now on on screen, you need to be sharp

2:37:13.940 --> 2:37:15.940
 because you cannot mess it up.

2:37:15.940 --> 2:37:18.940
 If you mess it up, it's like a loss on your record.

2:37:18.940 --> 2:37:20.940
 You're not taken seriously.

2:37:20.940 --> 2:37:22.940
 So that's how I see it.

2:37:22.940 --> 2:37:28.940
 And it's very fun because I had the chance to talk to a lot of guys

2:37:28.940 --> 2:37:34.940
 and on top of all the class that I'm having, like a few days ago I was with Danny Trujo.

2:37:34.940 --> 2:37:39.940
 And I always seek the advice of actors when I see some of them

2:37:39.940 --> 2:37:43.940
 that because I really admire how they do, you know, how they project their emotion.

2:37:43.940 --> 2:37:49.940
 And I asked him, Danny Trujo, I said to him, he's an amazing guy, by the way, very nice guy.

2:37:49.940 --> 2:37:56.940
 And I asked him, I say, how do you do to be, because you scared the hell out of me,

2:37:56.940 --> 2:37:59.940
 how do you do to be so scary?

2:37:59.940 --> 2:38:01.940
 Like, what is your trick?

2:38:01.940 --> 2:38:08.940
 And he tells me, he's like, George, if you threaten someone and you scream at him,

2:38:08.940 --> 2:38:17.940
 I'm going to kill you. It's not as scary if you're smiling and you say, I'm going to kill you.

2:38:17.940 --> 2:38:23.940
 Like, and he says also to me that another advice he gave me is like, when you say this,

2:38:23.940 --> 2:38:30.940
 think about you killing him for real, that how you hate him and how you're going to kill him.

2:38:30.940 --> 2:38:34.940
 So the camera will take the emotion out.

2:38:34.940 --> 2:38:36.940
 Don't try physically to do that.

2:38:36.940 --> 2:38:38.940
 That's the mistake I used to do before.

2:38:38.940 --> 2:38:43.940
 I used to physically show that I'm strong and angry and to be mean.

2:38:43.940 --> 2:38:49.940
 So these are just an example of tricks that I learned sometimes when I met an actor.

2:38:49.940 --> 2:38:52.940
 I always try to learn from everybody that I met in my life.

2:38:52.940 --> 2:38:56.940
 It's a difficult journey because then you have to go to some dark places as a person

2:38:56.940 --> 2:39:00.940
 because you really have to imagine some dark things.

2:39:00.940 --> 2:39:02.940
 It's fascinating, actually.

2:39:02.940 --> 2:39:07.940
 I think a lot of the actor, they have sometimes problems because of that.

2:39:07.940 --> 2:39:13.940
 Because now I understand why it's like, if you work on your bicep, your bicep will grow, right?

2:39:13.940 --> 2:39:20.940
 It's because it's the stress that you put on it that will make it grow, right?

2:39:20.940 --> 2:39:22.940
 Emotions, I believe, are the same way.

2:39:22.940 --> 2:39:33.940
 If you're used to dig inside of you down deep to make your negative emotion, depressive emotion comes out,

2:39:33.940 --> 2:39:39.940
 if something bad in your life happens, you will fall into those emotions much more rapidly

2:39:39.940 --> 2:39:43.940
 than someone who does not that every day, you know what I mean?

2:39:43.940 --> 2:39:45.940
 Because it's like a muscle memory.

2:39:45.940 --> 2:39:50.940
 If you program yourself to react a certain way, you will reach that point very often.

2:39:50.940 --> 2:39:56.940
 So that's why sometimes you see some guys, we often blame it on drugs,

2:39:56.940 --> 2:40:01.940
 but I think it's also because of the acting that they're used to be so on the hop top

2:40:01.940 --> 2:40:07.940
 and sometimes they go to the down deep so they're both extreme, you know?

2:40:07.940 --> 2:40:09.940
 You've got to be psychologically tough.

2:40:09.940 --> 2:40:10.940
 And that's life.

2:40:10.940 --> 2:40:13.940
 I'm so excited to see you challenge yourself in that direction.

2:40:13.940 --> 2:40:18.940
 That's one thing that I'm a little bit afraid that happened to me.

2:40:18.940 --> 2:40:27.940
 I really hope I'll always be having a problem to control my emotion be too much extreme.

2:40:27.940 --> 2:40:29.940
 I hope it does not happen to me.

2:40:29.940 --> 2:40:39.940
 And if I feel that I'm going towards that, I'm going to give up on my new objective

2:40:39.940 --> 2:40:42.940
 and find something else to achieve.

2:40:42.940 --> 2:40:45.940
 But in your personal life you want to be real with your emotions.

2:40:45.940 --> 2:40:48.940
 You don't want to.

2:40:48.940 --> 2:40:49.940
 Just like with biceps.

2:40:49.940 --> 2:40:51.940
 You don't want biceps that are too big.

2:40:51.940 --> 2:40:55.940
 You are real, but you are extreme real.

2:40:55.940 --> 2:41:01.940
 And that's what I think is something that could happen to actors sometimes

2:41:01.940 --> 2:41:03.940
 when they go too much into their emotion.

2:41:03.940 --> 2:41:08.940
 We talk about something guys that commit suicide perhaps.

2:41:08.940 --> 2:41:11.940
 I don't know because I don't know their real life,

2:41:11.940 --> 2:41:16.940
 but it could be something that they get so much into their character.

2:41:16.940 --> 2:41:20.940
 I didn't understand it at first because I'd never had acting class,

2:41:20.940 --> 2:41:23.940
 but after a while that you have acting class now you start to realize that

2:41:23.940 --> 2:41:28.940
 yeah, I understand why some actor get caught up in their emotion

2:41:28.940 --> 2:41:33.940
 because that can have an influence on their life, right?

2:41:33.940 --> 2:41:35.940
 You're on a fascinating journey.

2:41:35.940 --> 2:41:40.940
 George, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you'll be so nice to me

2:41:40.940 --> 2:41:42.940
 and you'll give me so much respect.

2:41:42.940 --> 2:41:45.940
 Just that tells everything I need to know about you as a human being.

2:41:45.940 --> 2:41:48.940
 With everything you've accomplished, you waste all your time

2:41:48.940 --> 2:41:52.940
 and you're so nice to me just as a fellow human being.

2:41:52.940 --> 2:41:54.940
 Man, I have so much respect.

2:41:54.940 --> 2:41:55.940
 I'm so honored.

2:41:55.940 --> 2:41:58.940
 And the energy you give me by just even showing up here,

2:41:58.940 --> 2:42:00.940
 I'll carry that forward for a long time to come.

2:42:00.940 --> 2:42:01.940
 George, I love it.

2:42:01.940 --> 2:42:02.940
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

2:42:02.940 --> 2:42:04.940
 Thank you Lex for having me on the show.

2:42:04.940 --> 2:42:07.940
 I've been looking to talk to you for a long time.

2:42:07.940 --> 2:42:11.940
 For me talking to a guy like you, it's a great learning experience

2:42:11.940 --> 2:42:16.940
 because I always learn and life is fascinating to me

2:42:16.940 --> 2:42:19.940
 and all the experience that we have in life,

2:42:19.940 --> 2:42:21.940
 it's something that can make us grow

2:42:21.940 --> 2:42:26.940
 and this experience for me just make me grow as well.

2:42:26.940 --> 2:42:28.940
 Plus, we look pretty damn sharp today.

2:42:28.940 --> 2:42:30.940
 Man in black, my friend.

2:42:30.940 --> 2:42:32.940
 Thanks George.

2:42:32.940 --> 2:42:34.940
 Nice.

2:42:34.940 --> 2:42:37.940

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Miyamoto Musashi.

2:42:52.940 --> 2:42:56.940
 Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.

2:42:56.940 --> 2:43:08.940
