00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
 The following is a conversation with Cal Newport.

00:02.400 --> 00:06.800
 He's a friend and someone who's writing like his book Deep Work, for example,

00:06.800 --> 00:11.200
 has guided how I strive to approach productivity and life in general.

00:11.200 --> 00:15.680
 He doesn't use social media and in his book Digital Minimalism,

00:15.680 --> 00:19.120
 he encourages people to find the right amount of social media usage

00:19.120 --> 00:21.200
 that provides value and joy.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.640
 He has a new book out called A World Without Email

00:24.640 --> 00:27.200
 where he argues brilliantly, I would say,

00:27.200 --> 00:31.680
 that email is destroying productivity in companies and in our lives.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.440
 And, very importantly, he offers solutions.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.640
 He is a computer scientist at Georgetown University

00:38.640 --> 00:40.960
 who practices what he preaches.

00:40.960 --> 00:44.480
 To do theoretical computer science at the level that he does it,

00:44.480 --> 00:48.240
 you really have to live a focused life that minimizes distractions

00:48.240 --> 00:50.320
 and maximizes hours of deep work.

00:51.120 --> 00:56.000
 Lastly, he's a host of an amazing podcast called Deep Questions

00:56.000 --> 01:00.640
 that I highly recommend for anyone who wants to improve their productive life.

01:00.640 --> 01:04.240

 As a side note, let me say that Deep Work

01:17.360 --> 01:20.640
 or long periods of deep focused thinking

01:20.640 --> 01:23.760
 have been something I've been chasing more and more over the past few years.

01:23.760 --> 01:30.080
 Deep Work is hard, but it's ultimately the thing that makes life so damn amazing.

01:30.080 --> 01:34.080
 The ability to create things you're passionate about in a flow state

01:34.080 --> 01:36.480
 where the distraction of the world just fade away.

01:37.040 --> 01:42.560
 Social media, yes, reading the comments, yes, I still read the comments,

01:42.560 --> 01:45.600
 is a source of joy for me in strict moderation.

01:45.600 --> 01:50.640
 Too much takes away the focused mind and too little, at least I think,

01:50.640 --> 01:52.400
 takes away all of the fun.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.960
 We need both, the focus and the fun.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.320
 if you can only figure out how to spell that.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.480
 And now, here's my conversation with Cal Newport.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.120
 What is Deep Work?

02:15.120 --> 02:16.480
 Let's start with a big question.

02:17.360 --> 02:21.600
 So, I mean, it's my term for when you're focusing without distraction.

02:21.600 --> 02:26.320
 On a cognitively demanding task, which is something we've all done,

02:26.320 --> 02:29.600
 but we had never really given it a name necessarily

02:29.600 --> 02:31.280
 that was separate from other type of work.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.320
 And so, I gave it a name and said,

02:34.320 --> 02:38.400
 let's compare that to other types of efforts you might do while you're working.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.080
 And see that the Deep Work efforts actually have a huge benefit

02:42.080 --> 02:43.600
 that we might be underestimating.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.800
 What does it mean to work deeply on something?

02:46.800 --> 02:49.280
 You know, I had been calling it hard focus.

02:49.280 --> 02:52.880
 In my writing before that, well, so the context you would understand,

02:52.880 --> 02:55.600
 I was in the theory group in CSAIL at MIT, right?

02:55.600 --> 02:58.960
 So, I was surrounded at the time when I was coming up with these ideas

02:58.960 --> 03:00.800
 by these professional theoreticians.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.160
 And that's like a murderer's row of thinkers there, right?

03:04.160 --> 03:07.440
 I mean, it's like Turing Award, Turing Award, MacArthur, Turing Award.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.760
 I mean, you know, the crew, right?

03:09.760 --> 03:11.120
 Theoretical computer science.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.960
 Theoretical computer science, yeah.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.280
 So, I'm in the theory group, right?

03:15.280 --> 03:19.360
 Doing theoretical computer science, and I publish a book.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.720
 So, you know, I was in this milieu where I was being exposed to people

03:22.720 --> 03:25.200
 where focus was their tier one skill.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.960
 Like, that's what you would talk about, right?

03:26.960 --> 03:30.880
 Like, how intensely I can focus, that was the V key skill.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.240
 It was like your 440 time or something if you were an athlete, right?

03:34.240 --> 03:37.040
 So, this is something that people were actually,

03:37.040 --> 03:39.200
 the theory folks are thinking about?

03:39.200 --> 03:39.760
 Oh, yeah.

03:39.760 --> 03:40.240
 Really?

03:40.240 --> 03:40.720
 Oh, yeah.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.160
 Like, they're openly discussing like,

03:42.160 --> 03:43.680
 how do you focus on that?

03:43.680 --> 03:45.920
 I mean, I don't know if they would, you know, quantify it,

03:45.920 --> 03:48.800
 but focus was the tier one skill.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.960
 So, you would come in, here would be a typical day,

03:50.960 --> 03:55.120
 you'd come in and Eric Domain would be sitting in front of a whiteboard,

03:55.120 --> 03:58.480
 right, with a whole group of visitors who had come to work with them.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.880
 And maybe they projected like a grid on there

04:00.880 --> 04:03.520
 because they're working on some graph theory problem.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.040
 You go to lunch, you go to the gym, you come back,

04:07.040 --> 04:10.320
 they're sitting there staring at the same whiteboard, right?

04:10.320 --> 04:11.760
 Like, that's the tier one skill.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.760
 This is the difference between different disciplines.

04:13.760 --> 04:17.840
 Like, I often feel, for many reasons, like a fraud,

04:17.840 --> 04:19.920
 but I definitely feel like a fraud when I hang out

04:19.920 --> 04:22.640
 with like either mathematicians or physicists.

04:22.640 --> 04:26.240
 It's like, it feels like they're doing the legit work

04:26.240 --> 04:28.560
 because when you talk closer in computer science,

04:28.560 --> 04:31.200
 you get to programming or like machine learning,

04:31.200 --> 04:35.680
 like the experimental machine learning

04:35.680 --> 04:38.640
 or like just the engineering version of it.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.560
 It feels like you're gone so far away from what's required

04:42.560 --> 04:46.000
 to solve something fundamental about this universe.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.160
 It feels like you're just like cheating your way

04:48.160 --> 04:50.480
 into like some kind of trick to figure out

04:50.480 --> 04:52.960
 how to solve a problem in this one particular case.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.400
 That's how it feels.

04:54.400 --> 04:59.840
 And so I'd be interested to hear what you think about that

04:59.840 --> 05:06.400
 because programming doesn't always feel like you need to do something.

05:06.400 --> 05:11.680
 It feels like you need to think deeply, to work deeply.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.120
 But sometimes it does.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.640
 So it's a weird dance.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.080
 For sure code does, right?

05:16.080 --> 05:17.840
 I mean, especially if you're coming up

05:17.840 --> 05:20.960
 with original algorithmic designs,

05:20.960 --> 05:22.960
 I think it's a great example of deep work.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.280
 I mean, yeah, the hardcore theoreticians,

05:25.280 --> 05:26.720
 they push it to an extreme.

05:26.720 --> 05:31.440
 I mean, I think it's like knowing that athletic endeavor is good

05:31.440 --> 05:34.080
 and then hanging out with an Olympic athlete.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.000
 Like, oh, I see that's what it is.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.640
 Grad students like me, we're not anywhere near that level,

05:38.640 --> 05:41.440
 but the faculty in that group,

05:41.440 --> 05:44.480
 these were the cognitive Olympic athletes.

05:44.480 --> 05:48.000
 But coding, I think, is a classic example of deep work

05:48.000 --> 05:50.720
 because I got this problem I want to solve.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.080
 I have all of these tools,

05:52.080 --> 05:56.240
 and I have to combine them somehow creatively and on the fly.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.720
 But so basically, I had been exposed to that.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.720
 So I was used to this notion when I was in grad school

06:00.720 --> 06:03.120
 and I was writing my blog, I'd write about hard focus.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.240
 You know, that was the term I used.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.120
 Then I published this book, So Good They Can't Ignore You,

06:07.120 --> 06:08.640
 which came out in 2012.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.560
 So like right as I began as a professor.

06:11.280 --> 06:14.640
 And that book had this notion of skill being really important

06:14.640 --> 06:15.760
 for career satisfaction,

06:15.760 --> 06:17.760
 that it's not just following your passion.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.240
 You have to actually really get good at something,

06:20.240 --> 06:21.760
 and then you use that skills as leverage.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.760
 And there's this big follow up question to that book of,

06:23.760 --> 06:25.760
 okay, well, how do I get really good at this?

06:25.760 --> 06:28.240
 And then I look back to my grad school experience,

06:28.240 --> 06:31.680
 I was like, huh, there's this focus thing that we used to do.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.720
 I wonder how generally applicable that is

06:34.720 --> 06:35.680
 into the knowledge sector.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.560
 And so as I started thinking about it, it became clear

06:38.560 --> 06:40.560
 there's this interesting storyline that emerged that,

06:40.560 --> 06:42.960
 okay, actually undistracted concentration is not just

06:42.960 --> 06:45.600
 important for esoteric theoreticians.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.440
 It's important here and support here and support here.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.480
 And that involved into the deep work hypothesis,

06:50.480 --> 06:53.680
 which is across the whole knowledge work sector,

06:54.480 --> 06:55.760
 focus is very important.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.920
 And we've accidentally created circumstances

06:57.920 --> 06:59.360
 where we just don't do a lot of it.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.880
 So focus is the sort of prerequisite for basically,

07:02.880 --> 07:05.760
 you say knowledge work, but basically any kind of skill

07:05.760 --> 07:08.320
 acquisition, any kind of major effort in this world.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.480
 Can we break that apart a little bit?

07:10.480 --> 07:15.360
 Yeah, so a key aspect of focus is not just that you're

07:15.360 --> 07:17.120
 concentrating hard on something,

07:17.120 --> 07:18.480
 but you do it without distraction.

07:19.280 --> 07:24.160
 So a big theme of my work is that context shifting kills

07:24.160 --> 07:25.520
 the human capacity to think.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.720
 So if I change what I'm paying attention to to something

07:28.720 --> 07:31.120
 different, really, even if it's brief and then try to bring

07:31.120 --> 07:32.720
 it back to the main thing I'm doing,

07:32.720 --> 07:35.120
 that causes a huge cognitive pile up that makes it very

07:35.120 --> 07:36.080
 hard to think clearly.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.880
 So even if you think, okay, look, I'm writing this code

07:38.880 --> 07:42.080
 or I'm writing this essay, and I'm not multitasking

07:42.080 --> 07:45.120
 and all my windows are closed and I have no notifications on,

07:45.600 --> 07:48.080
 but every five or six minutes you quickly check,

07:48.640 --> 07:51.920
 like an inbox or your phone, that initiates a context shift

07:51.920 --> 07:52.720
 in your brain, right?

07:52.720 --> 07:54.720
 We're going to start to suppress some neural networks

07:54.720 --> 07:56.320
 and we're going to try to amplify some others.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.480
 It's a pretty complicated process, actually.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.480
 There's a sort of neurological cascade that happens.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.520
 You rip yourself away from that halfway through

08:03.520 --> 08:04.480
 and go back to what you're doing,

08:04.480 --> 08:06.320
 and now it's trying to switch back to the original thing,

08:06.320 --> 08:07.920
 even though it's also in your brains in the process

08:07.920 --> 08:09.920
 of switching to these emails and trying to understand

08:09.920 --> 08:11.680
 those contexts, and as a result,

08:11.680 --> 08:14.720
 your ability to think clearly just goes really down.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.480
 And it's fatiguing, too.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.640
 I mean, you do this long enough that you get midday

08:18.640 --> 08:21.040
 and you're like, okay, I can't think anymore.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.240
 You've exhausted yourself.

08:22.240 --> 08:27.040
 Is there some kind of perfect number of minutes,

08:27.040 --> 08:27.840
 would you say?

08:27.840 --> 08:31.280
 So we're talking about focusing on a particular task

08:31.280 --> 08:36.080
 for one minute, five minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.200
 Is it possible to kind of context switch

08:39.200 --> 08:43.280
 while maintaining deep focus every 20 minutes or so?

08:43.280 --> 08:46.080
 So if you're thinking of like this, again,

08:46.080 --> 08:47.840
 maybe it's a selfish kind of perspective,

08:47.840 --> 08:49.440
 but if you think about programming,

08:49.440 --> 08:52.400
 you're focused on a particular design of a little bit,

08:52.400 --> 08:54.640
 maybe a small scale on a particular function

08:54.640 --> 08:58.160
 or a large scale on a system,

08:58.160 --> 09:01.360
 and then the shift of focus happens like this,

09:01.360 --> 09:03.440
 which is like, wait a minute,

09:03.440 --> 09:05.840
 is there a library that can achieve this little task

09:05.840 --> 09:06.800
 or something like that?

09:06.800 --> 09:08.800
 And then you have to look it up.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.160
 This is the danger zone.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.440
 You go to the internet.

09:11.440 --> 09:15.600
 And so you have to, now it is a kind of context switch

09:15.600 --> 09:18.400
 because as opposed to thinking about the particular problem,

09:18.400 --> 09:23.360
 you now have switch thinking about like consuming

09:23.360 --> 09:26.400
 and integrating knowledge that's out there

09:26.400 --> 09:29.840
 that can plug into your solutions to a particular problem.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.840
 It definitely feels like a context switch,

09:31.840 --> 09:34.400
 but is that a really bad thing to do?

09:34.400 --> 09:37.040
 So should you be setting it aside always

09:37.040 --> 09:40.640
 and really trying to, as much as possible, go deep

09:40.640 --> 09:44.240
 and stay there for like a really long period of time?

09:44.240 --> 09:46.640
 Well, I mean, I think if you're looking up a library

09:46.640 --> 09:49.440
 that's relevant to what you're doing, that's probably okay.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.000
 And I don't know that I would count that as a full context shift

09:52.000 --> 09:55.840
 because the semantic networks involved are relatively similar.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.640
 You're thinking about this type of solution.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.760
 You're thinking about coding.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.600
 You're thinking about this type of functions.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.640
 What you're really going to get hit

10:02.640 --> 10:06.000
 is if you switch your context to something that's different

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
 and if there's unresolved obligations.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
 So really the worst possible thing you could do

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
 would be to look at like an email inbox.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
 I guess here's 20 emails.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.800
 I can't answer most of these right now.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.000
 They're completely different.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
 Like the context of these emails, like, okay,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
 there's a grant funding issue or something like this

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
 is very different than the coding I'm doing.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
 And I'm leaving it unresolved.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
 So it's like someone needs something from me

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
 and I'm going to try to pull my attention back.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
 The second worst would be something that's emotionally arousing.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
 So if you're like, let me just glance over at Twitter.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
 I'm sure it's nice and calm and peaceful over there, right?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
 That could be devastating because you're going to expose yourself

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
 to something that's emotionally arousing.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
 That's going to completely mess up the cognitive plateau there.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
 And then when you come back to, okay, let me try to code again,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
 it's really difficult.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
 So it's both the information and the emotion.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
 Yeah, both can be killers if what you're trying to do.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
 So I would recommend at least an hour at a time

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
 because it could take up to 20 minutes

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
 to completely clear out the residue

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
 from whatever it was you were thinking about before.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
 So if you're coding for 30 minutes,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
 you might only be getting 10 or 15 minutes

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
 of actual sort of peak lexicon on there, right?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
 So an hour at least, you get a good 40, 45 minutes plus.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
 I don't know if I'm going to be able to do that.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
 I don't know if I'm going to be able to do that.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
 But it's just a really good 40, 45 minutes plus.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
 I'm partial to 90 minutes as a really good chunk.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
 We can get a lot done.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
 But just before you get exhausted,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
 you can sort of pull back a little bit.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
 Yeah.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
 And one of the beautiful people can read about

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
 in your book, Deep Work,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
 and I know this has been out for a long time

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
 and people are probably familiar with many of the concepts,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
 but it's still pretty profound

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
 and it has stayed with me for a long time.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
 There's something about adding the terms to it

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
 that actually makes you feel like it's not

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
 the terms to it that actually

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
 solidifies the concepts,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
 like words matter. It's pretty cool.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
 And just for me,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
 sort of as a comment,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
 there's

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
 it's a struggle and it's very difficult

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
 to maintain focus

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
 for a prolonged period of time,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
 but the days on which

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
 I'm able to accomplish several hours

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
 of that kind of work,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
 I'm happy.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
 So forget being productive and all that.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
 I'm satisfied with my life.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
 I feel fulfilled.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
 It's like joyful.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
 And then I can be,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
 I'm less of a dick to other people

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
 in my life afterwards.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
 It's a beautiful thing.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
 And I find the opposite

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
 when I don't do that kind of thing,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
 I'm much more irritable.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
 I feel like I didn't accomplish anything

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
 and there's this stress that then

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
 the negative emotion builds up to where

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
 you're no longer able to sort of

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
 have a lot of this amazing life.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
 So in that sense, deep work has been a source

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
 of a lot of happiness.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
 I'd love to ask you,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
 again, you cover this in the book,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
 but how do you integrate deep work

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
 into your life? What are different scheduling strategies

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
 that you would recommend just at a high level?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
 What are different ideas there?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
 Well, I mean, I'm a big fan of time blocking.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
 If you're facing your work day,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
 don't allow

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
 your inbox or to do list

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
 to sort of drive you. Don't just come into your day

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
 and think, what do I want to do next?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
 I'm a big fan of saying, here's the time

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
 available.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
 Let me make a plan for it.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
 I have a meeting here. I have an appointment here.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
 Here's what's left. What do I actually want to do with it?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
 In this half hour, I'm going to work on this.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
 For this 90 minute block, I'm going to work on that.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
 And during this hour, I'm going to try to fit this in

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
 and then actually have this half hour gap between two meetings.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
 So why don't I take advantage of that to go run five errands?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
 I can kind of batch those together.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
 But blocking out in advance,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
 this is what I want to do with the time available.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
 I mean, I find that's much more effective.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
 Now, once you're doing this, once you're in a discipline of time blocking,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
 it's much easier to actually see,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
 this is where I want, for example, to deep work.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
 And I can get a handle on the other things that need to happen

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
 and find better places

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
 to fit them so I can prioritize this.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
 And you're going to get a lot more of that done

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
 than if it's just going through your day and saying,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
 what's next?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
 I schedule every single day kind of thing.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
 So as I could try to do in the morning to try to

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
 have a plan.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
 I do a quarterly, weekly, daily planning.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
 So at the semester or quarterly level,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
 I have a big picture

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
 vision for what I'm trying to get done

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
 during the fall, let's say, or during the winter.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
 There's a deadline coming up

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
 for academic papers at the end of the season.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
 Here's what I'm working on.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
 I want to have this many chapters done of a book, something like this.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
 You have the big picture vision

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
 of what you want to get done.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
 Then weekly, you look at that

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
 and then you look at your week

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
 and you put together a plan for like,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
 what's my week going to look like?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
 What do I need to do?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
 How am I going to make progress on these things?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
 Maybe I need to do an hour every morning

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
 or I see that Monday is my only really empty day.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
 So that's going to be the day that I really need to nail

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
 on writing or something like this.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
 And then every day, you look at your weekly plan

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
 and say, let me block off the actual hours.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
 So you do that three scales,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
 the quarterly down to weekly down to daily.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
 And we're talking about actual times of day

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
 versus so the alternative is

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
 what I end up

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
 doing a lot and I'm not sure

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
 it's the best way to do it is

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
 scheduling

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
 the duration of time.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
 This is called the luxury when you don't have any meetings.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
 I'm like, religiously

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
 don't do meetings.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
 All other academics are jealous of you, by the way.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
 I know.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
 No Zoom meetings.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
 I find those are,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
 that's one of the worst tragedies

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
 of the pandemic

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
 is both the opportunity to

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
 have a positive thing

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
 is to have more time with your family,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
 sort of reconnect in many ways

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
 and that's really interesting.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
 Be able to remotely

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
 sort of not waste time on travel

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
 and all those kinds of things.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
 The negative is

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
 actually both those things are also sources of the negative.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
 But the negative is like

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
 it seems like people have multiplied the number of meetings

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
 because they're so easy to schedule

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
 and there's nothing

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
 more draining to me

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
 intellectually, philosophically.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
 My spirit

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
 is destroyed

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
 by even a 10 minute Zoom meeting.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
 What are we doing here?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
 What's the meaning of life?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
 Every Zoom meeting

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
 I have an existential crisis.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
 Kierkegaard with the internet connection.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
 What the hell are we talking about?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
 When you don't have meetings,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
 there's a luxury

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
 to really

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
 allow for certain things

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
 if they need to, like the important things

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
 like deep work

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
 sessions to last way longer

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
 than you maybe

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
 planned for. I mean that's my goal

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
 is to try to schedule, the goal is to schedule

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
 to sit and focus for a particular

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
 task for an hour

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
 and hope I can keep going

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
 and hope I can get lost in it.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
 And do you

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
 find that this is at all

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
 an okay way to go

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
 and the time blocking

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
 is just something you have to do

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
 to actually be an adult and operate in this real world?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
 Or is there some

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
 magic to the time blocking?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
 Well, I mean, there's magic to the intention.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
 There's magic to it

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
 if you have varied

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
 responsibilities, right? So I'm often

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
 juggling multiple jobs

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
 essentially. There's academic

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
 stuff, there's teaching stuff, there's book stuff,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
 there's the business surrounding

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
 my book stuff.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
 But I'm

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
 of your same mindset. If a deep work

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
 session is going well,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
 just rock and roll and let it go on.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
 So like one of the big keys of time block

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
 at least the way I do it. So I even sell

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
 this planner to help people time block.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
 It has many columns because

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
 the discipline is, oh, if your initial schedule

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
 changes, you just

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
 move over one, next time you get a chance to move over one

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
 column and then you just fix it for the time

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
 that's remaining. So in other words, there's

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
 no bonus for

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
 I made a schedule and I stuck with it.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
 There's actually not like you get a prize for it, right?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
 Like for me, the prize is

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
 I have an intentional plan for my time

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
 and if I have to change that plan, that's fine.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
 Like the state I want to be is basically

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
 at any point in the day, I've thought about what time

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
 remains and gave it some

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
 thought for what to do because I'll do the same thing

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
 even though I have a lot more

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
 meetings and other types of things I have to do in my

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
 various jobs and I basically prioritize

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
 the deep work and they get yelled at a lot.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
 So that's kind of my strategy is like just be

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
 okay, just be okay getting yelled at a

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
 lot because I feel you, if you're rolling

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
 yeah, well, that's what it is for me.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
 Like with writing, I think it's

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
 writing so hard in a certain way that it's

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
 you don't really get on a roll in some

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
 sense, like it's just difficult.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
 But working on proofs,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
 it's very hard

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
 to pull yourself away from a proof

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
 if you start to get some traction.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
 You've been at it for a couple hours and you feel

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
 the pins and tumblers starting to click

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
 together and progress is being made.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
 It's really hard to pull away from

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
 that. So I'm willing to get yelled at by almost everyone.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
 Of course, there is

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
 also a positive

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
 effect to pulling

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
 yourself out of it when things

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
 are going great because then you're kind of excited

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
 to resume. It's

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
 supposed to stopping on a dead end.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
 That's true.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
 There's an extra

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
 force of procrastination that comes with

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
 if you stop on a dead end

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
 to return to the task.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
 Yeah, or a cold start.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
 Like I'm on a stage now,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
 I submitted a few papers recently.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
 So now we're sort of starting

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
 something up from cold and it takes way

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
 too long to get going because it's very hard

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
 to get the motivation to schedule

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
 the time when it's not, yeah, we're in it.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
 Here's where we are, we feel like something's

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
 about the gift here. We need the very early stages

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
 where it's just, I don't know,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
 I'm going to read hard papers and it's going to be hard

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
 and I'm going to have no idea how to make progress.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
 It's not

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
 motivating. What about deadlines?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
 Can we, okay, so this is like

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
 a therapy session.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
 It's why

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
 it seems like I don't, I only get stuff

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
 done that has deadlines.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
 And so the one of the

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
 implied powerful things about time blocking

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
 is there's a kind of deadline

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
 or there's artificial

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
 or real sense of urgency.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
 Do you think it's possible to

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
 get anything done in this world without deadlines?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
 Why did deadlines work so well?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
 Well, I mean, it's a clear motivational

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
 signal, but in the

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
 short term, you do get an effect like that

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
 in time blocking. I think the strong effect

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
 you get by saying, this is the

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
 exact time I'm going to work on this

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
 is that you don't have the debate with yourself

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
 every three minutes about

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
 should I take a break now? This is the big

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
 issue with just saying, you know, I'm going to go write.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
 I'm going to write for a while and that's it

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
 because your mind is saying, well, obviously we're going to take some breaks.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
 We're not just going to write forever.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
 And so why not right now?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
 They're like, well, not right now. Let's go a little bit longer

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
 five minutes. Why don't we take a break now? We should probably

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
 look at the internet. Now you have to constantly have this battle.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
 On the other hand, if you're in a time block schedule,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
 I've got these two hours put aside for writing.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
 That's what I'm supposed to be doing.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
 I have a break scheduled over here.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
 I don't have to fight with myself.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
 And maybe at a larger scale, deadlines give you

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
 a similar sort of effect.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
 I know this is what I'm supposed to be working on because it's

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
 due.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
 Perhaps, but we are describing as much healthier

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
 sort of

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
 giving yourself over and you talk about this in

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
 the new email book as the process.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
 I mean, in general, you talk about it all

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
 over is creating a process and then

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
 giving yourself over

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
 to the process.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
 But then you have to be

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
 strict with yourself.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
 But what are the deadlines you're talking about?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
 Like with papers? What's the main type of

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
 deadline work?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
 Well, so papers, definitely.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
 But, you know,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
 publications, like say this podcast,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
 I have to

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
 publish this podcast

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
 early next week one because your book

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
 is coming out. I'd love to

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
 support this amazing book.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
 But the other is I have to

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
 fly to Vegas

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
 on Thursday

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
 to run 40 miles with David Goggins.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
 And so I want

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
 this podcast, this conversation

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
 we're doing now to be out of my life.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
 Like, I don't want to be in a hotel

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
 in Vegas, like

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
 editing the, like freaking out while David

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
 Goggins is yelling. On hour, on hour

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
 43 of

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
 your terephthong thing.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
 But actually it's possible that I still

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
 will be doing that, you know, because it's

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
 that's not a heart, that's a softer deadline, right?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
 But those are sort of, life imposes

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
 these kinds of deadlines.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
 I'm not, so yeah, papers are nice

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
 because there's an actual deadline.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
 But I am almost

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
 referring to like

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
 the pressure that people put on you.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
 Hey man, you said you're going to get this done

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
 two months ago. Why haven't you gotten it done?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
 I don't see, I don't like that pressure.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
 Yeah. So maybe now, first of all, I think we can

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
 I ate it too. We can agree by the way, having

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
 David Goggins yell at you is probably

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
 the top productivity technique.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
 I think we'd all get a lot more

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
 done if he was yelling.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
 But see, I don't like that. So I will try

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
 to get things done early. I like having

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
 flex. I also don't like the idea

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
 of this has to get done

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
 today, right? Like, it's due

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
 at midnight and we've got a lot to do

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
 as the night before because then I get in my head

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
 about what if I get sick? Or like

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
 what if, you know, what if I

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
 get a bad night's sleep and I can't think clearly.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
 So I like to have the flex. So I'm all

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
 process. And that's like the

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
 philosophical aspect of that book, Deep Work, is that

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
 there's something very human and deep

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
 about just wrangling

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
 with the world of ideas. I mean, Aristotle talked

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
 about this if you go back and read the ethics.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
 He's trying to understand the meaning

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
 of life and he eventually ends up ultimately

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
 at the human capacity

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
 to contemplate deeply.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
 It's kind of a teleological argument. It's the

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
 things that only humans can do and therefore it

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
 must be somehow connected to our ends. And he said

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
 ultimately that's where that's where he found

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
 his meaning. But, you know, he's touching on some

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
 sort of intimation there. That's correct. And

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
 so what I try to build my life around is

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
 regularly thinking hard

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
 about stuff that's interesting.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
 Just like if you get a fitness habit going,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
 you feel

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
 off when you don't do it.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
 I try to get that cognitive habit. So it's like

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
 I got it. I mean, look, I have my bag here

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
 somewhere with my notebook in it because I was

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
 thinking on the Uber ride over, I was like,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
 you know, I could get some, I'm working on this

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
 new proof and it just, so you train

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
 yourself. You train yourself to appreciate

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
 certain things. And then over time, the hope is

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
 that it accretes.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
 Well, let's talk about some demons because

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
 I wonder, okay, this

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
 is like Deep Work,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
 and the

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
 the world without

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
 email books that to me symbolize

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
 the life I want

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
 to live. Okay.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
 And then there is, I'm like

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
 despite appearances

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
 adult at this point.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
 And this is the life I actually live.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
 And

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
 I'm in constant chaos.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
 You said you don't like that anxiety. I hate

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
 it too. But it seems like

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
 I'm always in it. It's a giant

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
 mess. It's like

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
 it's almost like whenever I

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
 establish, whenever I have successful processes

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
 for doing Deep Work, I'll add stuff

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
 on top of it just to introduce the chaos.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
 Yeah. And like I don't want to.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
 Yeah. But you know, you have to

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
 look in the mirror at certain point and you have

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
 to say like, who the hell

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
 am I? Like I keep doing this.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
 Is this something that's fundamental

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
 to who I am or do I really need to fix this?

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
 What's the chaos right now? Like I've seen

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
 your video about like your routine. It seemed

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
 very structured

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
 and deep. In fact, I was really envious of it. So like

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
 what's the chaos now that's not in that

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
 video? Many of those sessions

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
 go way longer. I don't get enough sleep.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
 Yeah. And then the

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
 main introduction of chaos is

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
 it's taken on too many things on the to do

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
 list. I see.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
 I mean, I suppose it's a problem that everybody

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
 deals with was just saying

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
 not saying no. But it's not like

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
 I have trouble saying no.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
 It's that there's so much cool

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
 shit in my life. Okay, listen

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
 there's nothing I love more in

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
 this world than the Boston Dynamics

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
 robots.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
 And they're giving me spot.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
 So there's nothing to do. What am I going to

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
 say? No. So they're getting me

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
 spot and I want to do some computer vision stuff

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
 for the hell of it. Okay, so that's

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
 now a to do item. And then you go to Texas

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
 for a while and there's Texas and

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
 everything's happening. There's all the interesting people down

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
 there. And then there's surprises, right?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
 There are power outages in Texas. There's

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
 constant changes to plans and all those kinds

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
 of things. And you sleep less.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
 And then there's personal stuff like just

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
 people in your life, sources of

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
 stress, all those kinds of things.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
 But it does feel like

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
 if I'm just being introspective

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
 that I bring it on to

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
 myself. I suppose a lot of people do this kind

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
 of thing is

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
 they

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
 flourish under pressure.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
 And I wonder if that

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
 if that's just a hack

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
 I've developed as a habit

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
 early on in life

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
 that needs, you need to let go

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
 of. You need to fix.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
 But it's all interesting things.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
 Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, because

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
 these are all interesting things. Well, one of

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
 the things you talked about in deep work, which is

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
 like really important is like having

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
 an end to the day. Yeah.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
 Like putting it down. Yeah.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
 Like that. I don't think I've ever done

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
 that in my life. Yeah. Well, see,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
 I started doing that early because

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
 I got married early.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
 So, you know, I didn't have a real job. I was a grad

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
 student, but my wife had a real job. And so

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
 I just figured I should do my

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
 work when she's at work

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
 because, you know, hey, when works over

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
 she'll be home and I don't want to be, you know,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
 on campus or whatever. And so

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
 really early on I just got in that habit of

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
 this is when, you know, this is when you

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
 work. And then when I was a postdoc,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
 which is kind of an easy job, right?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
 I put artificial

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
 I was like, I want to train.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
 I was like, when I'm a professor, it's going to be busier

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
 because there's demands that professors have

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
 beyond research. And so as a postdoc,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
 I added artificial, large time consuming

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
 things into the middle of my day. I basically

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
 exercised for two hours in the middle of the day

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
 and do all this productive meditation and stuff

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
 like this while still maintaining the nine

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
 to five. So it's like, okay, I want to get

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
 really good at putting artificial

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
 constraints on so that I stay. I didn't want

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
 to get flabby

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
 when my job was easy so that when I became a

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
 professor and now all of that's paying off

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
 I have a ton of kids. So

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
 now I don't really have a choice.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
 That's what's probably keeping me away from cool things

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
 is I just don't have time to do them.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
 And then after a while, people, you know,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
 stop bothering.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
 Well, but that, you know, but that's how

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
 you have a successful life. Otherwise, you're going to

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
 it's too easy to then go into the full

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
 Hunter as Thompson. Yeah.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
 Like to where no

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
 nobody wants

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
 nobody functional wants to be in

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
 your vicinity. Like

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
 you're driving, you attract the people

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
 that

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
 have a similar behavior

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
 pattern as you. Yeah. So if you

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
 if you live in chaos, you're going to attract

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
 chaotic people. And then

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
 it becomes like this self

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
 fulfilling prophecy. Yeah.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
 And it feels like

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
 I'm not bothered by it

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
 but I guess this is all coming

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
 around to exactly what you're saying, which is like

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
 I think one of the big hacks

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
 for productive people that I've met

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
 is to get married

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
 and have kids. Honestly.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
 It's very perhaps counterintuitive.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
 Yeah. But it gets

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
 it's like the ultimate

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
 timetable enforcer.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
 Yeah. It enforces a lot of timetables

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
 though it has a huge

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
 kids have a huge productivity hit those.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
 You got to weigh it. But here's the

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
 complicated thing though. Like you could think

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
 about in your own life starting the podcast

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
 as one of these just cool

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
 opportunities that you put on yourself, right?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
 Like, you know, I could have been talking to you at MIT

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
 four years ago and like, don't do that.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
 Like your research is going well, right?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
 But then everyone who watches you is like, okay, this podcast

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
 is the direction that's taking you is like a couple

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
 of years from now.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
 It's going to be something really

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
 monumental that you're probably just going to probably lead to, right?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
 There'll be some really

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
 it just feels like your life is going somewhere.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
 It's going somewhere. It's interesting. Yeah.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
 Unexpected. Yeah. Yeah. So how do you balance those two

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
 things? And so what I try to throw at it

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
 is this this motto of do less, do better

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
 know why, right? So do

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
 do less, do better

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
 know why it used to be the

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
 motto of my website years ago.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
 So do a few

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
 things but like an interesting array, right? So I

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
 was doing MIT

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
 stuff, but I was also writing,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
 you know, so a couple of things are, you know, they were

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
 interesting. Like I have a couple bets placed

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
 on a couple different numbers on the roulette table,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
 but not too many things.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
 And then really try to do those things really well and

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
 see where it goes. Like with my writing, I just spent years

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
 and years and years just trained like I want to be a better

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
 writer, want to be a better writer. I started writing student

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
 books when I was a student.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
 I really wanted to write hardcover idea books. I started

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
 training. I would I would use like New Yorker

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
 articles to train myself.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
 I'd break them down and then I'd get commissions with

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
 much smaller magazines and practice the skills

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
 and I took forever until, you know,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
 but now today, like I actually get a right for the New

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
 Yorker, but it took like a decade.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
 So a small number of things tried to do them really well

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
 and then the know why is have a connection to

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
 some sort of value. Like in general, I think

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
 this is worth doing and then

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
 seen where it leads.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
 And so the choice of the few things

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
 is grounded in what like a little

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
 like a little flame of

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
 passion, like a love for the thing, like a sense

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
 that you say you wanted to write

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
 get good at writing.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
 You had that kind of introspective

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
 moment of thinking this actually brings me a lot

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
 of joy and fulfillment.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
 Yeah, I mean, it gets complicated because I wrote

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
 a whole book about following your passion being

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
 bad advice, which is like the first thing

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
 I kind of got infamous for.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
 I wrote that back in 2012.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
 But the argument there is like

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
 passion cultivates, right?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
 So what I was pushing back on

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
 was to myth that the passion

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
 for what you do exists full

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
 intensity before you start.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
 And then that's what propels you.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
 Where actually the reality is as you get better

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
 at something, as you gain more autonomy, more skill

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
 and more impact, a passion grows along with it.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
 So that when people look back

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
 later and say, oh, follow your passion,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
 what they really mean is I'm very passionate

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
 about what I do and that's a worthy goal.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
 But how you actually cultivate that

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
 is much more complicated than just introspection

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
 is going to identify, like for sure

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
 you should be a writer or something like this.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
 So I was actually quoting you.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
 I was on a social network last night

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
 in a clubhouse.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
 I don't know if you've heard of it.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
 I have to ask you about this because I was

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
 invited to do a clubhouse. I don't know what that means.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
 A tech reporter

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
 has invited me to do a clubhouse about my new book.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
 That's awesome.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
 Well, let me know when because I'll show up.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
 But what is it? Okay.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
 So first of all, let me just mention that I was

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
 in a clubhouse room

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
 last night and I kept plugging

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
 exactly what you said about

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
 passion. So we'll talk about it.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
 It was a room that was focused on burnout.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
 Okay.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
 But first, clubhouse

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
 is a kind of fascinating place

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
 in terms of your mind

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
 would be very interesting to analyze this place

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
 because

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
 we talk about email,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
 we talk about social networks,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
 but clubhouse is something very different

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
 and I've encountered it in other places,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
 Discord, and so on.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
 That's voice only communication.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
 So it's a bunch of people in a room.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
 They're just eyes closed.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
 All you hear is their voices.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
 Real time.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
 Live. It only happens live.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
 You're technically not allowed to record,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
 but some people still do,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
 big conversations,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
 but the whole point is it's there live.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
 And there's different structures. Like on Discord,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
 it was so fascinating.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
 I have this Discord server

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
 that would have hundreds of people

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
 in a room together.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
 We're all just little icons that can mute

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
 and unmute our mics.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
 So you're sitting there,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
 so it's just voices,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
 and you're able with hundreds of people

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
 to

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
 not interrupt each other.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
 But first of all, as a dynamic system,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
 you see icons

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
 just like mics muted or not muted basically.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
 So everyone's muted and they

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
 unmute and it starts flashing.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
 So you're like, okay, let me

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
 get precedence.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
 So it's the digital equivalent of when you're

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
 in a conversation at a faculty meeting

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
 and you sort of

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
 make some noises while the other person's

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
 finishing and so people realize, okay,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
 this person wants to talk next, but now it's

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
 purely digital. You see a flashing.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
 Faculty meeting, which is very interesting,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
 even as we're talking now,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
 there's a visual element

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
 that seems to increase the probability

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
 of interruption.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
 When it's just darkness,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
 you actually listen better

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
 and you don't interrupt.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
 So if you create a culture, there's always

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
 going to be assholes, but they're

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
 actually exceptions.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
 Everybody adjusts, they kind of evolve

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
 to the beat of the room.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
 Okay, that's one fascinating

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
 aspect. It's like, okay, that's weird

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
 because it's different than like a zoom

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
 call where there's video.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
 It's just audio.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
 You think video adds,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
 but it actually seems like it subtracts.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
 The second aspect of it

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
 that's fascinating is when it's no

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
 video, just audio,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
 there's an intimacy.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
 It's weird.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
 With strangers,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
 you connect

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
 in a much more real way.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
 You go to podcasts.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
 With a lot of people.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
 With a lot of people and new people.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
 And they bring,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
 okay, first of all, different voices,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
 like low voices and like

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
 high voices.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
 It's more difficult to judge.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
 In Discord, you couldn't even see

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
 it was a culture where you do funny

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
 profile pictures as opposed

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
 to your actual face.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
 In Clubhouse, it's your actual face.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
 You're an older person, younger person.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
 In Discord, you couldn't. You just have to judge

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
 based on the voice.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
 But there's

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
 something about the listening

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
 and the intimacy of

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
 being surprised by different strangers.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
 It feels almost like

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
 a party with friends

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
 and friends of friends you haven't met yet,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
 but you really like.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
 Now Clubhouse also has an interesting

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
 innovation where there's a large crowd

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
 that just listens and there's a stage.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
 And you can bring people up on the stage.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
 So only people on stage are talking.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
 And you can have

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
 like five, six, seven, eight, sometimes 20,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
 30 people on stage. And then you can also

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
 have thousands of people just listening.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
 So there's a,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
 I don't know, a lot of people are being surprised

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
 by this. Why is it called a social network?

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
 It seems like it doesn't have, there's not social links.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
 There's not a feed that's trying

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
 to harvest attention. It feels like a

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
 communication.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
 So the social network

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
 aspect is you follow people.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
 And the people you follow,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
 now this is like the first social network that's

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
 actually correct use of follow, I think,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
 you're more likely to see

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
 the rooms they're in. So there's a, your

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
 feed is a bunch of rooms that are going on right

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
 now. And

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
 the people you follow

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
 are the ones that will increase

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
 the likelihood that you'll see the room they're in.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
 And so the final result

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
 is like, there's a list of really interesting

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
 rooms. Like

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
 I've always, I've been speaking Russian

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
 quite a bit. There's practicing

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
 but also just like talking politics

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
 and philosophy in Russian.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
 I've never done that before, but it allows me to connect

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
 with that community. And then

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
 there's a community of

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
 like, it's funny, but like

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
 I'll go in a community of all African

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
 American people talking about race

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
 and I'll be welcomed. Yeah.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
 I've never had, like I've literally never

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
 been in a difficult conversation

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
 about race

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
 like with people from all over the place

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
 it's like fascinating.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
 Musicians, jazz musicians, I don't

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
 know. You could say that a lot of other

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
 places could have created that culture, I suppose

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
 Twitter and Facebook

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
 a lot for that culture, but there's something about

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
 this network because it stands

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
 now, because

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
 no Android users.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
 It's probably just because it's iPhone people.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
 Yeah. It's less inspiratory

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
 or something. Well, like less, listen

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
 I'm an Android person, so I got

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
 an iPhone just for this network. This is funny.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
 Yeah.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
 For now it's all like

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
 there's very few trolls. Yeah.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
 There's very few people that are trying to manipulate

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
 the system and so on. So I don't know

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
 it's interesting. Now the downside

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
 the reason you're going to hate it

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
 is

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
 because it's so intimate, because it pulls you in

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
 and pulls in very successful people

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
 like you just

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
 like really successful

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
 productive, very busy people

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
 it

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
 it's a huge time sink. It's very difficult

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
 to pull yourself out.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
 You mean once you're in a room? Well no, leaving

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
 the room is actually easy. The beautiful

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
 thing about a stage with multiple people

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
 there's actually a little button that says

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
 leave quietly. Okay.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
 So culture, no, etiquette

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
 wise, it's okay to just leave.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
 Yeah. So you and I in a room

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
 when it's just you and I, it's a little awkward to leave.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
 If you're asking questions and I'm just gone. Yeah.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
 But and actually if you're being interviewed

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
 for the book

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
 that's weird because you're now

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
 in the event and you're supposed to

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
 but usually the person interviewing

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
 would be like okay it's time for you to go

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
 it's more normal but the

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
 normal way to use the room

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
 it's like you're just opening the app

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
 and there'll be like I don't know

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
 Sam Harris

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
 Eric

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
 Weinstein

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
 I think Joe Rogan showed up to the app

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
 Bill Gates, these people on stage

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
 just like randomly just plugged in

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
 and then you'll step up on stage

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
 listen maybe you won't contribute

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
 at all, maybe you'll say something funny

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
 and then you'll just leave and there's

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
 the

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
 addicting aspect to it, the reason it's a time sink

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
 is you don't want to leave.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
 What I've noticed about exceptionally busy people

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
 that they

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
 love this, I think

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
 might have to do with the pandemic

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
 there's a loneliness

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
 but also it's really cool people

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
 when

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
 was the last time you talked to Sam Harris

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
 or whoever, think of

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
 anybody

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
 any faculty

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
 this is like what universities strive

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
 to create but it's taken

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
 cultural evolution and trying to get

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
 a lot of interesting smart people together that run into each other

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
 we have really strong

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
 faculty in a room

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
 together with no scheduling

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
 and this is the power of it

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
 it's like you just show up

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
 there's none of that baggage of scheduling and so on

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
 and there's no pressure to leave

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
 no pressure to stay

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
 it's very easy for you to leave

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
 you realize that there's a lot of constraints on meetings

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
 and like faculty

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
 even stopping by

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
 before the pandemic

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
 a friend or faculty or colleague and so on

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
 there's a weirdness about leaving

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
 but here

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
 there's not a weirdness about leaving

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
 you discover something interesting

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
 but the final result when you

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
 observe it

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
 it's very fulfilling

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
 I think it's very beneficial

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
 but it's very addicting

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
 so you have to make sure you

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
 moderate

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
 that's interesting

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
 maybe I'll try it

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
 the things that make me suspicious about other platforms

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
 aren't here

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
 the feed is not full of

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
 user generated content

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
 it's a rating process with all the weird incentives

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
 and nudging that does

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
 and you're not producing content that's being harvested

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
 to be monetized

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
 by another company

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
 it seems like it's more

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
 ephemeral

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
 the feed is just actually just showing you

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
 here's interesting things happening

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
 you're not jockeying in the feed for

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
 look I'm being clever or something

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
 and I'm going to get a light count that goes up

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
 and that's going to influence

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
 and there's more friction

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
 between listening to smart people

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
 versus scrolling through

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
 there's something there

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
 there's all these articles

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
 that seem, I haven't really read them

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
 but why are reporters negative about this

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
 competition

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
 the New York Times wrote this article called

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
 unfettered conversations happening on clubhouse

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
 is

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
 I'm right in picking up a tone

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
 even from the headlines that there's some negative

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
 vibes from the press

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
 so I can say

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
 well I'll tell you what the article was saying

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
 which is

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
 they're having

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
 cancelable conversations

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
 the biggest people in the world almost trolling

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
 the press

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
 and the press is desperate

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
 by saying

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
 that you guys are looking for clickbait

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
 from our genuine human conversations

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
 and so

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
 I think

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
 honestly the press is just like

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
 what do we do with this

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
 first of all it's a lot of work

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
 okay

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
 it's what Naval says which is like

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
 this is skipping the journalist

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
 like the interview you

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
 if you go on clubhouse the interview you might do

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
 for the book

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
 will be with somebody who's like a journalist

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
 interviewing you

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
 that's more traditional

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
 it'll be a good introduction for you to try it

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
 but the way to use clubhouse

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
 is you just show up

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
 and it's like

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
 again like me

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
 I keep

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
 mentioning Sam Harris as if it's like the only person I know

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
 but like a lot of these

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
 major faculty I don't know

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
 max tag mark

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
 major faculty just sitting there and then you show

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
 up and then

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
 I'll ask like oh don't you have a book coming out

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
 or something and then you'll talk about

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
 the book and then you'll leave five minutes later because you have to go get coffee

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
 including that

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
 so like that's the

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
 it's not the journalist that you're not going to actually

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
 enjoy the interview as much

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
 because it'll be like the normal thing

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
 like you're there

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
 40 minutes or an hour and there'll be questions from the audience

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
 right like I'm doing an event

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
 next week for the book launch

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
 where it's like Jason Fried and I are

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
 talking about email

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
 but it's using some more like a thousand

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
 people who are there to watch virtually

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
 but it's using some sort of traditional webinar

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
 clubhouse would be a situation

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
 where that could just happen informally

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
 like I jump in like Jason's there and then someone else jumps in

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
 and yeah that's interesting

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
 but for now it's still closed

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
 so even though there's a lot of excitement

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
 and there'll be

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
 quite famous people just sitting there

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
 listening to you

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
 but the numbers aren't exactly

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
 high so you're talking about rooms

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
 like even the huge rooms are like

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
 just a few thousand

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
 and this is probably like Soho in the 50s

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
 or something too just because of the

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
 exponential growth

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
 give it seven more months and

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
 one invite begets two invites begets four

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
 invites begetting pretty soon it'll be

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
 everyone and then the rooms in your feed are going to be

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
 whatever

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
 marketing performance enhancing drugs or something like that

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
 but then and a bunch of competitors

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
 there's already like 30 plus

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
 competitors sprung up twitter spaces

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
 so twitter is creating a competitor

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
 that's going to likely destroy clubhouse

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
 because they just have a much larger user base

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
 and they already have a social network

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
 so I

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
 I would be very cautious of course

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
 with the addictive element but it doesn't

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
 just like you said this particular

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
 implementation in its early stages

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
 doesn't have the like

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
 the

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
 it doesn't have the context switching problem

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
 you'll just switch to it and you'll be stuck

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
 yeah the keep a context is great

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
 yeah

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
 and but then I think the best way

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
 I've found to use it is

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
 to acknowledge that these things

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
 pull you in

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
 I've used it in the past

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
 like almost

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
 you know I'll go get a coffee and I'll tune into a conversation

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
 as if that's how I use podcast sometimes

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
 I'll just like play a little bit of a podcast

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
 and then

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
 you know I can just turn it off the problem

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
 with these is it pulls you in it's really

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
 interesting and then the other problem that you'll

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
 experience is like

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
 somebody will recognize you

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
 and then they'll be like oh lex

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
 come on up

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
 hey I had a question for you

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
 and then it takes a lot for you to go

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
 like to to ignore that

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
 yeah yeah so yeah and then you pulled

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
 in and it's fascinating and it's really cool

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
 people so it's like a source of a lot of joy

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
 but it is

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
 you have to be very very careful

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
 the reason I brought it up is we

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
 there's a room just an entire club

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
 actually on burnout

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
 and

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
 I brought you up and I brought David

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
 Goggins is the process I go through

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
 because

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
 my passion goes up and down

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
 it dips

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
 and I don't think I trust my own mind

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
 to

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
 tell me

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
 whether I'm getting close to burnout or exhaustion

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
 or not

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
 I kind of go with the David Goggins model of

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
 I mean he's probably more applying it

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
 to running but

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
 when it feels like your mind can't take

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
 anymore

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
 that you're just 40%

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
 your capacity

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
 I mean it's just like an arbitrary level

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
 it's the Navy SEAL thing

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
 I mean you could put that at any percent

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
 but it is remarkable that

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
 if you just take it one step at a time

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
 just keep going

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
 it's similar to this idea of a process

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
 if you just trust the process and you just keep following

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
 even if the passion goes up and down

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
 and so on

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
 then ultimately

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
 if you look in aggregate

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
 the passion will increase

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
 and if you have two things

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
 this has been a big strategy of mine

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
 what you hope for is off phase

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
 off phase alignment

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
 sometimes it's in phase and that's a problem

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
 but off phase alignment is good

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
 so okay

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
 my research I'm struggling

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
 my book stuff is going well

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
 and so when you add those two waves together

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
 we're doing pretty well and then

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
 in other periods like on my writing

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
 I feel like I'm just not getting anywhere

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
 but I've had some good papers

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
 that can counteract each other

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
 now sometimes they fall into sync

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
 and then it gets rough

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
 because everything for me is cyclical

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
 good periods, bad periods with all this stuff

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
 so typically they don't coincide

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
 so it helps compensate

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
 when they do coincide you get really high highs

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
 like where everything is clicking

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
 and then you get these really low lows

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
 where your research is not working

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
 your program is not clicking

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
 you feel like you're nowhere with your writing

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
 and then it's a little rougher

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
 do you think about the concept of burnout

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
 because I personally have never experienced burnout

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
 in the way that folks talk about

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
 which is

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
 it's not just the up and down

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
 it's like you don't want to do anything

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
 ever again

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
 for some people it's like physical

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
 to the hospital kind of thing

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
 so I do worry about it

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
 so when I used to do

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
 student writing like writing about students

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
 or student advice

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
 it came up a lot with students at elite schools

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
 and I used to call it deep procrastination

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
 but it's a real

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
 really vivid, very replicatable

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
 syndrome where they

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
 stop being able to do schoolwork

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
 like this is due

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
 and the professor gives you an extension

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
 and the professor gives you an incomplete

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
 and says we're going to fail the course

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
 you have to hand this in and they can't do it

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
 it's like a complete stop

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
 on the ability to actually do work

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
 so I used to counsel students who had that issue

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
 and often it was a combination of

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
 just analysis

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
 you have just the physical and cognitive difficulties

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
 they're usually under a very hard load

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
 they're doing too many majors, too many extracurriculars

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
 just really pushing themselves

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
 and the motivation

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
 is not sufficiently intrinsic

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
 so if you have a motivational center

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
 that's not completely on board so a lot of these kids

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
 like when I'm dealing with MIT kids

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
 their whole town was shooting off fireworks

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
 that they got in

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
 everyone's hoped that they were going there

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
 and that they're in three majors

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
 and they're really interested in being a doctor or whatever

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
 so your motivation is not in the right place

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
 the motivational psychologist would say

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
 the locus of control was more towards the extrinsic

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
 end of the spectrum

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
 and you have hardship

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
 and you could just fritz out the whole system

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
 and so I would always be very worried about that

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
 so I think about that a lot

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
 I do a lot of multi phase

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
 or multi scale seasonality

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
 so I'll go hard on something for a while

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
 and then for a few weeks go easy

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
 I'll have semesters that are hard

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
 so on multiple scales and in the day

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
 I'll go really hard on something but then have a hard cut off at five

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
 so like every scale

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
 it's all about rest and recovery

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
 because I really want to avoid that and I do burn out

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
 I burnt out pretty recently

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
 I get minor burnt out

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
 I had a couple of papers

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
 that I was trying to work through for a deadline

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
 a few weeks ago

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
 and I wasn't sleeping well

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
 and there's some other things going on

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
 and it just knocks out

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
 and I get sick usually is how I know I've pushed myself too far

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
 and so I kind of pull it back

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
 now I'm doing this book launch

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
 then after this book launch I'm pulling it back again

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
 so I like seasonality for rest and recovery

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
 I think it's crucial and at every scale

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
 daily, monthly

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
 and then at the annual scale

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
 an easy summer for example

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
 I think it's like a great idea if that's possible

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
 you just made me realize

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
 that's exactly what I do

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
 because I feel like I'm not even close to burn out

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
 or anything even though I'm in chaos

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
 I feel

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
 the right exact ways of seasonality

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
 is the

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
 not even the seasonality but like

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
 you always have multiple seasons

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
 operating it's like you said

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
 because when you have a lot of cool shit going on

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
 there's always at least one thing

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
 that's a source of joy

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
 that there's always a reason

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
 I suppose the fundamental thing

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
 and I've known people that suffer

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
 from depression too

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
 the fundamental problem with the experience

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
 of depression and burnout

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
 is like why do

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
 life is meaningless

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
 and I always have an answer

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
 of like why

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
 why today could be cool

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
 and you have to contrive it

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
 if you don't have it, you have to contrive it

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
 I think it's really important

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
 like okay well this is going bad

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
 so now is the time to start thinking about

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
 look I started a podcast during the pandemic

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
 it's like this is going pretty bad

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
 but you know what this could be something

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
 really interesting

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
 deep questions with Kyle Newport

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
 and I do it all in that voice

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
 I love the podcast by the way

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
 but yeah I think David Foster Wallace said

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
 the key to life is to be

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
 unboreable

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
 I've always kind of taken that to heart

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
 which is like

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
 you should be able to maybe artificially

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
 generate anything

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
 like

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
 find something

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
 in your environment

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
 in your surroundings that's a source of joy

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
 like everything is fun

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
 did you read The Pale King

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
 that goes deep on boredom

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
 it's like uncomfortable

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
 it's like an uncomfortable meditation on boredom

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
 the characters in that are just driven

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
 to the extremes of

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
 I just bought three books on boredom

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
 the other day

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
 so now I'm really interested in this topic

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
 because I was anxious about my book launch

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
 happening this week so I was like okay I need something else

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
 so I have this idea for

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
 an article first but as a book

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
 okay I need something cool

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
 to be thinking about because I was worried about

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
 the launch going to work

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
 the pandemic what's going to happen

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
 so this is exactly what we're talking about

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
 so I went out and I bought a bunch of books

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
 and I'm beginning like a whole

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
 sort of intellectual exploration

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
 well I think that's one of the profound

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
 ideas in deep work

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
 that you don't expand on

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
 too much as boredom

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
 yeah well so

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
 deep work had a superficial idea

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
 about boredom which was

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
 I had this chapter called embrace boredom

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
 a very functionalist idea

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
 was basically

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
 you have to have some boredom in your regular schedule

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
 or your mind is going to form a Pavlovian connection

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
 between as soon as

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
 I feel boredom I get stimuli

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
 and once it forms that connection it's never going to tolerate deep work

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
 so there's this very pragmatic

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
 treatment of boredom

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
 of your mind better be used

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
 to the idea that sometimes you don't get stimuli

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
 because otherwise you can't write for three hours

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
 like it's just not going to tolerate it

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
 but more recently what I'm really interested in boredom

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
 is it as a fundamental human drive

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
 right because it's

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
 incredibly uncomfortable

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
 and think about the other things that are incredibly uncomfortable

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
 like hunger or thirst

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
 they serve a really important purpose

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
 for a species right like if something is really

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
 distressing there's a reason pain is really uncomfortable

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
 because we need to worry about getting injured

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
 thirst is really uncomfortable because

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
 we need water to survive

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
 boredom why is that uncomfortable

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
 and I've been

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
 interested in this notion that

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
 boredom is about

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
 driving us towards

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
 productive action

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
 like as a species I mean think about it

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
 what got us to actually take advantage of these

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
 brains what got us to actually

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
 work with fire what got us to start shaping

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
 stones and the hand axes

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
 and figuring out if we could actually sharpen a stick

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
 sharpen after we could throw it as a

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
 melee weapon or a distance weapon

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
 mammoth right boredom

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
 drives us towards action

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
 so now I'm fascinated by this fundamental action

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
 instinct because I have this

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
 theory that I'm working on that

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
 we're out of sync with it

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
 just like we got we have this drive for hunger

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
 but then we introduce junk food and got out of sync with hunger

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
 and it makes us really unhealthy

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
 we have this drive towards action but then we

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
 overload ourselves and we have all

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
 of these distractions and then that causes

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
 it's like a cognitive

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
 action obesity type things because it short

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
 circuits this system that wants us to do things

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
 but we put more things in our plate than we can possibly do

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
 and then we're really frustrated we can't do them

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
 and we're short circling all of our wires so it all comes back

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
 to this question

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
 well what would be the ideal

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
 the ideal

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
 sort of amount of stuff to do and type of things to do

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
 like if we wanted to look back at our ancestral

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
 environment and say

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
 if I could just build from scratch

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
 what type how much work I do and what I work on

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
 to be as in touch with that as like

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
 paleo people are trying to get their diets in touch with that

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
 and so now I'm just

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
 it's something I made up

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
 but now I'm going deep on it

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
 and one of my podcast listeners I was talking about

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
 on the show and I was like

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
 trying to learn about animals and boredom and she sent

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
 me this cool article from an animal behaviorist

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
 journal about what we know about

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
 human boredom versus animal boredom

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
 so trying to figure out that puzzle

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
 is the wave that's high

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
 so I can get through the wave that's low

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
 like I don't know about this pandemic book launch

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
 and my research

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
 my research is stumbling a little bit because of the pandemic

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
 and so I needed a

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
 nice you know high so there we go

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
 there's a case study

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
 well it's both a case study and

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
 a very interesting set of concepts because I didn't even realize

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
 that it's so simple

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
 I'm one of the people

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
 that

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
 has an interesting push and pull

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
 dynamic with hunger trying to understand the hunger

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
 with myself like I probably

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
 have a non healthy relationship with food

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
 I don't know

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
 there's probably a perfect

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
 that's a nice way to think about

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
 diet as action

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
 there's probably an

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
 optimal diet response

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
 to the

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
 experience that our body is telling us

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
 the signal that our body is sending

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
 which is hunger and in that same way

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
 boredom is sending a signal

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
 and most of our intellectual

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
 activities in this world

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
 our creative activities are

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
 essentially a response

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
 to that

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
 signal

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
 and think about this analogy

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
 that we have this hunger instinct that junk food

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
 short circuits

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
 we'll satisfy that hyper

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
 palatably and it doesn't end up well

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
 now think about modern

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
 attention engineered

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
 digitally mediated entertainment

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
 we have this boredom instinct

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
 we can take care of that

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
 with a hyper palatable alternative

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
 is that going to lead to a similar problem

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
 so I've been fasting a lot lately

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
 like I'm doing

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
 eating once a day

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
 I've been doing that for over a month

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
 just eating one meal a day

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
 and primarily meat

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
 but it's very

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
 fasting has been incredible

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
 for me for focus

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
 for well being

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
 just for feeling good

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
 we'll put on a chart what makes me feel good

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
 and

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
 that fasting and eating primarily

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
 this diet makes me feel really good

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
 and so

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
 but that ultimately

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
 what fasting did

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
 I haven't fasted super long yet like a seven day

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
 diet which I really would like to do

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
 but even just fasting for a day for 24 hours

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
 gets you

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
 in touch with your

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
 with this signal

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
 it's fascinating like you get to

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
 learn to listen to your body

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
 that like

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
 it's okay to be hungry

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
 it's a little signal that sends you stuff

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
 and then I get to

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
 listen to how it responds

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
 when I put food

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
 in my body

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
 and I get to like okay

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
 cool so like food is a thing

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
 that pacifies the signal

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
 it sounds ridiculous okay

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
 and do different types of food

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
 it feels different so you learn about what your body

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
 wants

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
 for some reason fasting

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
 it's similar to the deep work

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
 of the body's boredom

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
 fasting allowed me to go into

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
 mode of listening of trying to understand the signal

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
 that I could say

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
 I have an unhealthy

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
 appreciation of fruit okay

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
 I love apples and cherries

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
 like I don't know how to moderate them

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
 so if you take just same amount of calories

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
 I don't know calories matter but

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
 say say calories 2,000 calories of cherries

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
 versus 2,000

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
 calories of steak

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
 if I eat 2,000 calories of steak

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
 a little bit of like green beans

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
 cauliflower I'm going to feel

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
 really good

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
 fulfilled, focused and happy

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
 if I eat cherries I'm going to be

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
 I'm going to wake up behind a dumpster

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
 crying with like

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
 naked and like it's just

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
 with everything

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
 and it's just like bloated

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
 just not and unhappy

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
 and also the mood

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
 swings up and down I don't know

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
 and I'll be

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
 much hungrier the next day

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
 sometimes it takes a couple days

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
 but when I introduce carbs into the system

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
 too many carbs

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
 it starts it's just

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
 unhealthy I go into this roller coaster

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
 as opposed to a calm boat ride

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
 along the river and the Amazon or something like that

59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.000
 so fasting was the

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.000
 mechanism for me to start

1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:04.000
 listening to the body

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.000
 I wonder if you can do that same kind

1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000
 I guess that's what meditation a little bit is

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.000
 a little bit but listen the boredom

1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000
 but so two years ago I had a book out called

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:14.000
 digital minimalism and one of the

1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:16.000
 things I was recommending that people do

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:18.000
 is basically a 30 day fast

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.000
 but from digital personal

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000
 entertainment social media online videos

1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000
 anything that captures

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000
 your attention and dispels boredom

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000
 and people were thinking like

1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000
 oh this is a detox like I just want

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.000
 to teach your body not to need the

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000
 distraction or this or that but it really wasn't what I was interested in

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.000
 I wanted there to be

1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000
 space that you could

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.000
 listen to your boredom

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.000
 okay I can't just dispel it I can't just look at the screen

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.000
 and revel in it a little bit

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000
 and start to listen to it and say what is this really

1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:48.000
 pushing me towards

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.000
 and you take the new stuff the new technology

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000
 off the table and sort of ask what is this

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:54.000
 what am I craving like what's the

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.000
 activity equivalent of

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.000
 2000 calories of meat with a little bit of

1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.000
 green beans on the side and I had

1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:02.000
 1700 people go through this experiment like spend

1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000
 30 days doing this and it's hard at first

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000
 but then they get used to listening

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000
 to themselves and sort of seeking out what is

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000
 this really pushing me towards and it was pushing

1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000
 people towards connection

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000
 was pushing people towards I just want to

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000
 go be around other people it was pushing

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000
 people towards high quality

1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000
 leisure activities like I want to go

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.000
 do something that's complicated and it took

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:24.000
 weeks sometimes for them to get in touch with their boredom

1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.000
 but then it completely

1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000
 rewired how they thought

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000
 about what do I want to do with my time outside

1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000
 of work and then the idea is when you're done with that

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000
 then it was much easier to go back and completely

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000
 change your digital life because

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000
 you have alternatives right you're not just trying

1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000
 to abstain from things you don't like but

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000
 that's basically a listening to boredom

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000
 experiment like just be there with the boredom

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000
 and see where it drives you

1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000
 when you don't have you know the digital

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000
 cheesets okay so if I can't do that

1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.000
 where is it going to drive me well I guess

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000
 I kind of want to go to the library which

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000
 came up a lot by the way a lot of people rediscovered

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000
 the library you know with physical books

1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.000
 physical books like you can just go borrow

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000
 them and like it there's like low pressure

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.000
 and you can explore and you bring them home

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000
 and then you read them and you can like sit by the window

1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000
 and read them and it's nice weather outside and I used

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000
 to do that 20 years ago they're listening

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.000
 to boredom. So can you maybe

1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000
 elaborate a little bit on the different

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000
 experiences that people had when they quit

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000
 social media for 30 days like is that

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.000
 if you were to recommend that process

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.000
 what is ultimately

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000
 the goal? Yeah digital

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000
 minimalism that's my philosophy

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.000
 for all this tech

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000
 and it's working backwards from what's important

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.000
 so it's you figure out

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000
 what you're actually all about like what you want to do

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000
 what you want to spend your time doing and

1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000
 then you can ask okay is there a place

1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000
 that tech can amplify or support some of these things

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000
 and that's how you decide what tech to use

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000
 and so the the process

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000
 is let's actually get away from everything

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000
 let's be bored for a while let's let's really

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.000
 spend a month getting really figuring out what do I

1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.000
 actually want to do what I want to spend my time

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000
 doing what's important to me you know what makes

1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000
 me feel good and then when you're done you can bring back

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000
 in tech very strategically to help those things

1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000
 and that was the goal

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000
 that turns out to be much more successful than

1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.000
 when people take a

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000
 abstention only approach

1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000
 so if you come at your tech life

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000
 and say you know whatever I look at

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.000
 Instagram too much like I don't like how much on

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.000
 Instagram that's a bad thing

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000
 I want to reduce this bad thing so here's my new

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.000
 thing I'm going to spend less time looking at Instagram

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000
 much less likely to succeed in the long term

1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000
 so we're much less likely

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.000
 at trying to reduce this sort of amorphous

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000
 negative because you know in the moment

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000
 it's not that bad and would be kind of interesting

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000
 to look at it now when you're instead controlling

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.000
 behavior because you have a positive that you're

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.000
 aiming towards it's very powerful for people like I want

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000
 my life to be like this

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000
 here's the role that tech plays in that life

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000
 the connection to wanting

1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000
 your life to be like that is very very strong

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000
 and then it's much much easier to say yeah like

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000
 using Instagram is not part of my plan for how I

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000
 have that life and I really want to have that life so of course

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000
 I'm not going to use Instagram so it turns out to be a much

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000
 more sustainable way to

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000
 tame what's going on so if you quit

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000
 social media for 30 days you kind of have to

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000
 do the work

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000
 yes to do the work of thinking like

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000
 what am I actually what makes

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000
 me happy in terms of these tools that I've

1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000
 previously used and

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000
 when you try to integrate them back

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000
 how can they integrate them

1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000
 to maximize the thing they actually

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000
 what makes me happy unrelated to technology

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000
 like what do I actually what do I want my life

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000
 to be like well maybe what I want to do is be

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000
 outside in nature two hours a day and spend a lot more time

1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000
 like helping my community and sacrificing on behalf

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.000
 of my connections and then have

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000
 some sort of intellectually engaging

1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000
 leisure activity like I'm reading

1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000
 or trying to read the great books and having more

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000
 calm and seeing the sunset you

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000
 you create this picture

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000
 and then you go back and say well I still need my

1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000
 Facebook group because that's how I keep up

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000
 with my cycling group but

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000
 Twitter is just you know toxics on helping

1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000
 any of these things and well I'm an artist so

1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000
 I kind of need Instagram to get inspiration

1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000
 but if I know that's why I'm using Instagram

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000
 I don't need it on my phone it's just on my computer

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000
 and I just follow ten artists and check it once a week

1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000
 like you really can start to

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000
 it was the number one thing that differentiated

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.000
 in that experiment the people who ended up

1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.000
 sustainably making changes

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:02.000
 and getting through the 30 days and those who didn't

1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:04.000
 was the people who did the experimentation

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.000
 and the reflection like let me try to figure out

1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.000
 what's positive they were much

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.000
 more successful than the people that just said

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.000
 I'm sick of using my phone so much

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.000
 so I'm just gonna white knuckle it just 30 days will be good

1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:16.000
 for me I just gotta just gotta get away from it

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:18.000
 or something it doesn't last

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:20.000
 so you don't use social media currently

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.000
 do you find that a lot of people

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.000
 going through this process

1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000
 will

1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000
 will seek to basically arrive

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000
 at a similar place to not use

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000
 social media primarily? About half

1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000
 right so about half when they went

1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:36.000
 through this exercise and these aren't

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.000
 quantified numbers you know this is just

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000
 they sent me reports and yeah

1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.000
 that's pretty good though so 1700

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000
 yeah yeah so so so roughly

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.000
 half probably got rid

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.000
 of social media altogether once they did this exercise

1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000
 they realized these things I care about

1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000
 I don't social media is not the tools

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.000
 that's really helping the other half

1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:56.000
 kept some there are some things

1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:58.000
 in their life or some social media was useful

1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:00.000
 but the key thing is if they knew

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.000
 why they were deploying social media

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:04.000
 they could put fences around it

1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:06.000
 so for example of those half that kept

1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:08.000
 some social media almost none of them kept it on

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:10.000
 their phone oh interesting

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:12.000
 yeah I can't optimize if you if you don't know

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.000
 what it is the function you're trying to optimize so it's like this

1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.000
 huge hack like once you know this is why I'm using

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:18.000
 Twitter then you can have a lot of rules

1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:20.000
 about how you use Twitter and suddenly

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:22.000
 you take this cost benefit ratio and it goes

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:24.000
 like way from the company's advantage

1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:26.000
 and way over towards your advantage it's

1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:28.000
 kind of fascinating because I've been

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:30.000
 torn with social media but I did this kind

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:32.000
 of process I haven't actually done it for 30

1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000
 days which I probably should

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000
 I'll do it for like a week at a time and regularly

1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000
 and thinking what

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000
 kind of approach

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:42.000
 to Twitter works for me

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:44.000
 what I'm

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:46.000
 distinctly aware of the fact

1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000
 that I really enjoy

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000
 posting once or twice a day

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.000
 and at that time

1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:54.000
 checking from the previous post

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.000
 it like it makes me feel

1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000
 even when there's like

1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000
 negative comments they go

1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000
 right past me and when there's positive

1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:04.000
 comments makes you smile I feel like love

1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.000
 and connection with people

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000
 especially people I know but even just in

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000
 general it's like makes me feel like the world

1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000
 is full of awesome people

1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.000
 okay when you increase that from

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:16.000
 checking from two to like

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.000
 I don't know what the threshold is for me but probably

1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:20.000
 like five or six per day

1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000
 it starts going to anxiety world

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000
 like where negative comments will

1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000
 actually stick to me

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000
 might mentally

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000
 and positive comments

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:32.000
 will feel more shallow

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.000
 yeah yeah it's kind

1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:36.000
 of fascinating so I

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.000
 I've been trying

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000
 to there's been long stretches of time

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.000
 I think

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000
 December and January where I did just

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000
 post and check post and check

1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000
 that was that makes me

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:50.000
 really happy most of

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000
 2020 I did that made me really happy

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.000
 recently I started

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000
 like I'll go you know

1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000
 you go right back in like a drug addict

1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.000
 will you check it like I don't know what

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000
 that number is but that number is high

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.000
 you don't come out happy no one

1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000
 comes out of a day full of Twitter

1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000
 celebrating humanity and it's

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.000
 not even because I'm very

1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:12.000
 fortunate to have a lot of just the positivity

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000
 might the Twitter but I

1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000
 there's just a general anxiety

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000
 I wouldn't even say

1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000
 I wouldn't even say it's

1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000
 probably the thing that you're talking about with the context

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000
 switching it's almost like

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000
 an exhaustion

1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000
 I wouldn't even say it's like a negative feeling

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:30.000
 it's almost just an exhaustion to where

1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000
 I'm not creating anything beautiful in my

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000
 yeah life just exhausted

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000
 existential exhaustion existential

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:38.000
 exhaustion but I wonder do you think

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000
 it's possible to use from the people

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000
 you've seen from yourself

1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000
 to use social media in the way

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000
 I'm describing moderation or is it always

1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000
 going to become

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000
 when people do this exercise you get lots of

1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000
 lots of configurations

1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000
 so for people that have

1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:56.000
 a public presence for example

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.000
 like what you're doing is not that not that unusual

1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000
 okay I post

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000
 one thing a day and my audience likes it

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000
 and that's kind of it

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000
 but you thought through like okay

1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000
 this supports something I value which is like having a sort of

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000
 informal connection with my audience

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000
 and being exposed

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000
 to some sort of

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000
 positive randomness

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000
 okay that's my goal

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000
 what's the right way to do it well I don't need

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000
 to be on Twitter on my phone all day maybe what I do is

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000
 every day at five I do my post

1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000
 and check on the day

1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000
 so I have a writer friend

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000
 Ryan Holiday who writes about the Stoics

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000
 a lot and he has this

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000
 similar strategy he post one

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.000
 quote every day from

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000
 usually from a famous Stoic and sometimes from a contemporary figure

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.000
 and that's just what he does he just

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000
 post it and it's a very positive thing

1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000
 like his readers really love it because it's just like a dose

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.000
 of inspiration he doesn't spend time

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000
 he's never interacting with anyone on

1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000
 social media right but that's an example

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.000
 of I figured out what's important to me

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000
 what's the best way to use tools to amplify it

1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000
 and then you get advantages out of the tools

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000
 so like I like what you're doing

1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000
 I looked you up I looked up your Twitter feed

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:02.000
 before I came over here I was curious

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000
 you're not on there a lot

1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000
 I don't see you yelling at people

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000
 do you think social media as a medium

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000
 changed the cultural standards

1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.000
 and I mean it in a have you read Neil Postman

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.000
 at all have you read like a amusing ourselves to death

1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000
 he was a social critic technology

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000
 critic and wrote a lot

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.000
 about sort of technological determinism

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000
 so the ways which is

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000
 a really influential idea to a lot of my work

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000
 which is actually a little out of fashion right now in academia but

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.000
 the ways that the properties

1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.000
 and presence of technologies

1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000
 change things about humans in a way that's

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000
 not really intended or planned by the humans themselves

1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.000
 and he is that that book is all about how

1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.000
 different communication medium

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000
 like fundamentally just changed the way the human brain

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.000
 understands and operates

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000
 and so he sort of gets into the what happened

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000
 when the printed word was widespread

1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000
 and how television changed it and this was all

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000
 pre social media

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000
 but this one of these ideas I'm having is like what

1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000
 to the degree to which I get into it sometimes

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000
 I show again to a little bit like the degree to which

1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000
 like Twitter in particular

1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:00.000
 just changed the way that people conceptualized

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000
 what for example

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000
 debate and discussion was

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000
 like it introduced a rhetorical dunk culture

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.000
 or sort of more about

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.000
 tribes not giving ground to other tribes

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000
 and and it's like it's a complete

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.000
 there's different places and times

1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000
 when that type of discussion

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000
 with thought of differently right

1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.000
 well yeah absolutely but I

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000
 I tend to believe I don't know what you think that

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000
 there's the technological solutions like

1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000
 there's literally different

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000
 features in Twitter

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000
 that could completely reverse that there's so

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000
 much power in the different

1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000
 choices that are made and

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000
 it could still be highly engaging

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000
 and have very different effects perhaps

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000
 more negative but or hopefully more positive

1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.000
 yeah so I'm trying to pull these

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000
 two things apart so there's these

1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.000
 two ways social media let's say could

1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000
 change the experience of reading a

1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000
 major newspaper today one could be

1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000
 a little bit more economic right so

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000
 the internet made it cheaper to get news

1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000
 the newspapers had to retreat to a paywall model

1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.000
 because it was the only way they were going to survive

1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000
 but once you're in a paywall model then

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000
 what you really want to do is make your tribe

1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000
 which is within the paywall very very happy

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000
 with you so you want to work to them but then

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000
 there's the sort of the determinist point of view

1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000
 which is the properties of Twitter which were arbitrary

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000
 Jack and Evan just

1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000
 whatever let's just do it this way

1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:16.000
 influence the very way that people now

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000
 understand and think about the world

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000
 influence the other I think yeah they

1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000
 they kind of started adjusting together

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000
 I did this thing I mean

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.000
 I'm trying to understand this part of the

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000
 part of the

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000
 I've been playing with the entrepreneurial

1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.000
 idea there's a very particular

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000
 dream I've had of a startup

1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.000
 that this is a longer

1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000
 term thing with has to do with

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000
 artificial intelligence but

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000
 more and more it seems like there's a

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.000
 some trajectory through creating

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000
 social media

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000
 that type of technology is very different

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000
 than what people are thinking I'm doing but

1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000
 it's a kind of challenge

1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000
 to the way the

1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.000
 Twitter is done but

1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.000
 it's not obvious what the best mechanisms

1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000
 are to still make an exceptionally

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000
 engaging platform

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000
 my clubhouse is very engaging

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.000
 and not have any other negative effects

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000
 I for example there's

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:10.000
 Chrome extensions that allow

1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:12.000
 you to turn off

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000
 all likes and dislikes and all

1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000
 that from Twitter so all you're seeing

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.000
 is just the content

1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000
 on Twitter that to me

1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000
 creates that's not a compelling

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000
 experience at all because I still

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000
 need

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.000
 I would argue I still need the likes

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.000
 to know what's a tweet worth reading

1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:32.000
 because I don't only have a limited amount of time

1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000
 so I need to know what's valuable

1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.000
 it's like great Yelp reviews on tweets

1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.000
 but I've turned

1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000
 off on

1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000
 for example on my account on YouTube

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.000
 I've

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.000
 I wrote a Chrome extension that

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000
 turns off all likes

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000
 and dislikes and just views

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000
 I don't know how many views the video gets

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000
 and so on unless it's on my phone

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000
 do you take off the recommendations

1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000
 the

1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.000
 YouTube some people the distraction for

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.000
 YouTube is a big one for people

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000
 no I'm not worried about the distraction

1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000
 because I'm able to control myself

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000
 on YouTube you don't rabbit hole

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000
 I don't rabbit hole so you have to know your

1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000
 demons or your addictions whatever

1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000
 on YouTube I'm okay I don't have I don't keep clicking

1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000
 the negative

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000
 feelings come from seeing

1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000
 the views on

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.000
 stuff you've created

1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.000
 so you don't want to see your views

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000
 yeah I'm just like

1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000
 speaking to the things that I'm aware of of myself

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000
 that are helpful and things

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000
 that are not helpful emotionally

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000
 and I feel like there should be

1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:36.000
 we need to create actually tooling for

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000
 ourselves that's not me

1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000
 with JavaScript but anybody

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:42.000
 is able to create

1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000
 sort of control the experience

1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.000
 that they have yeah well

1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.000
 so my my big unified theory

1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000
 on social media is I'm very I'm very bearish

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000
 yes on the big platforms

1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.000
 having a long future you are

1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.000
 I think the moment I think the moment

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000
 of three or four major platforms

1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000
 is

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.000
 knock on the last right so

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.000
 I don't know okay this is just perspective right so you

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000
 can start shorting these stocks

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000
 on my don't tell me

1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000
 yeah yeah don't do Robin hood

1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000
 so here's here's I think the

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000
 the big mistake the major platforms made

1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000
 as when they

1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000
 they took out the network effect

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000
 advantage right so the original

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.000
 pitch especially if something like Facebook

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000
 or Instagram was the people

1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.000
 you know are on here

1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.000
 right so like what you use this for you can connect

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000
 to people that you already know this is what

1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.000
 makes the network useful we so therefore

1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.000
 the value of our network grows

1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.000
 quadratically with the number of users and therefore

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000
 it's such a head start that there's

1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:40.000
 no way that someone else can catch up

1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.000
 but when they shifted and when Facebook

1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.000
 took to lead of say we're going to shift towards

1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000
 a newsfeed model they basically

1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000
 said we're going to try to in the moment

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000
 get more data and get more likes

1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.000
 like what we're going to go towards is actually just

1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.000
 seen interesting stuff

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:56.000
 like seen diverting information so people took

1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:58.000
 this social internet impulse

1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.000
 to connect to people digitally to other tools

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.000
 like group text messages and what's

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:04.000
 happened stuff like this right so you don't think

1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:06.000
 about these tools as oh this is where I connect

1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:08.000
 with people once it's just a feed that's kind

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:10.000
 of interesting now you're competing

1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.000
 with everything else that can produce interesting

1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:14.000
 content that's diverting I think that is

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.000
 a much fiercer competition

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:18.000
 because now for example you're going up against

1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:20.000
 podcast right I mean like okay I guess

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:22.000
 you know the Twitter feed is interesting right

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:24.000
 now but also a podcast is interesting

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.000
 or something else could be interesting too I

1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.000
 think it's a much fiercer competition when

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.000
 there's no there's no more network effects

1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000
 and so my sense is we're going to see a

1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.000
 fragmentation into what I call long tail

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:36.000
 social media where if I don't need

1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:38.000
 everyone I know to be on a

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:40.000
 platform then why not have

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.000
 three or four bespoke platforms I use

1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.000
 where it's a thousand people and it's all

1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:46.000
 we're all interested in you know whatever

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:48.000
 AI or comedy and

1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:50.000
 we've perfected this interface

1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:52.000
 and maybe it's like clubhouse it's audio or

1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.000
 something and we all pay two dollars so we

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:56.000
 don't have to worry about attention harvesting

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:58.000
 and that's going to be wildly more entertaining

1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:00.000
 and I'm thinking about comedians on Twitter

1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:02.000
 it's not the best

1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.000
 internet possible format

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.000
 for them expressing themselves and being

1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:08.000
 interesting that you have all these comedians that are trying to

1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:10.000
 like well I can do like little clips and little whatever

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.000
 like I don't know if there was a

1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:14.000
 long tail social media and it's really this is where the comedians

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000
 are and this podcast and the comedians are on

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:18.000
 podcast now so this is my thought is that there's

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:20.000
 really no

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.000
 there's really no strong advantage to having

1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.000
 one large

1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:26.000
 platform this everyone is on

1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:28.000
 and if all you're getting from it is I now have

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.000
 different options for diversion and

1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:32.000
 like uplifting aspirational or whatever types

1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:34.000
 entertainment that whole thing could fragment

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:36.000
 and I think the glue that was holding together

1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.000
 was network effects and I don't think they realized

1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:40.000
 that when network effects have been destabilized

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:42.000
 they don't have the centrifugal force anymore

1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:44.000
 and they're spinning faster and faster but is

1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:46.000
 a Twitter feed really that much more

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.000
 interesting than all these streaming services

1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:50.000
 is it really that much more interesting

1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:52.000
 than clubhouse is it that much more

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.000
 interesting than podcast

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.000
 I feel like they don't realize how unstable

1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:58.000
 their ground actually is yeah that's fascinating

1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.000
 but

1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.000
 the thing that makes

1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000
 Twitter and Facebook work

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000
 I mean the news feed

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000
 you're exactly right like you can just duplicate

1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000
 the news like if it's

1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000
 not the social network and it's the news feed

1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:14.000
 then why not have multiple different

1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.000
 feeds that are more

1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:18.000
 that are better at satisfying there's a

1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:20.000
 dopamine gamification that they've figured out

1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.000
 yeah the end

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000
 so you have to whatever you create

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.000
 you have to at least provide

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.000
 some pleasure in that same gamification

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.000
 kind of way it doesn't

1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000
 have to have to do with scale

1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:34.000
 of large social networks but I mean

1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:36.000
 I guess you're implying that

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000
 you should be able to design that kind of

1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:40.000
 mechanism in other forms

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000
 or people are turning on that gamification

1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.000
 I mean so people are getting wise to it

1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.000
 and are getting uncomfortable about it right

1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:48.000
 so if I'm offering something

1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.000
 these exist out here

1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000
 they realize sugar is bad to you

1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000
 they're going to stop eating

1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000
 drinking a lot is great too but also after a while

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:58.000
 you realize there's problems

1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:00.000
 some of the long tail social media networks

1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.000
 that are out there that I've looked at

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.000
 they offer usually like a deeper sense

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:06.000
 of connection like it's usually

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:08.000
 interesting people that you share some affinity

1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.000
 and you have these carefully cultivated

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000
 I wrote this New Yorker piece a couple years ago

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.000
 about the indie social media movement that really

1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.000
 got into some of these different

1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000
 technologies but I think the technologies

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000
 on you know, Macedon versus

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.000
 whatever like forget or discord

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.000
 actually let's forget the protocols right now it's the idea

1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.000
 of okay

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000
 and there's a lot of these long tail social media

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000
 groups what people are getting out of it which I think

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000
 can outweigh the dopamine

1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000
 gamification is strong

1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000
 connection and motivation like you're in a group

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.000
 with other guys that are all trying to

1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.000
 be you know better dads or something like

1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000
 this and you talk to them on a regular

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000
 basis and you're sharing your stories and there's

1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.000
 interesting talks and that's a

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000
 powerful thing too. One interesting thing

1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000
 about scale of Twitter is

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000
 you have these viral spread of information

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.000
 so sort of

1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:56.000
 Twitter has become a newsmaker

1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:58.000
 in itself. Yeah, I think it's a problem.

1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:00.000
 Well yes but I don't wonder what

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:02.000
 replaces that because

1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:04.000
 because then you immediately

1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:06.000
 one of the reporters would have to do

1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:08.000
 some work again I don't know. The problem with reporters

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:10.000
 and journalism is that

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:12.000
 they're intermediary

1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:14.000
 they have control

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.000
 I mean this is the problem in Russia currently

1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:18.000
 is that you have

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:20.000
 it creates a shield

1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.000
 between the people and the news

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.000
 the interesting thing and the powerful thing

1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:26.000
 about Twitter is that

1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:28.000
 the news originates from the individual

1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000
 that's creating the news like

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000
 you have the president of the United States

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.000
 the former president of the United States on Twitter

1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000
 creating news you have

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000
 Elon Musk creating news you have people

1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000
 announcing stuff on Twitter

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000
 as opposed to talking to a journalist

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.000
 it feels much more genuine

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.000
 and

1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000
 it feels very powerful

1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.000
 but actually coming to realize

1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.000
 it doesn't need the social

1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000
 network you can just put that

1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.000
 announcement on a YouTube type thing.

1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.000
 This is what I'm thinking right so this is my point about that

1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.000
 because that's right the democratizing power

1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000
 of the internet is fantastic

1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000
 I'm an old school internet nerd

1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:06.000
 a guy that was you know

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:08.000
 telemediting in the servers and gophering before

1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000
 the World Wide Web was around right so I'm a huge internet booster

1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000
 and that's one of its big power

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.000
 but when you put everything on Twitter

1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:16.000
 I think the fact that you've taken

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.000
 you homogenized everything

1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000
 right so everything looks the same

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.000
 moves with the same low friction is very difficult

1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.000
 you have know what I call distributed curation

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000
 right the only curation that

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.000
 really happens there's a little bit with likes

1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000
 and also the algorithm but if you look back

1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.000
 to pre Web 2.0

1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000
 or early Web 2.0 when a lot

1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000
 of this was happening let's say on blogs

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.000
 where people own their own servers and you had your different

1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000
 blogs there was this distributed

1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.000
 curation that happened where in order

1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000
 for your blog to

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000
 get on people's radar and this had nothing

1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.000
 to do with any gatekeepers or legacy media

1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000
 it was over time

1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.000
 you got more links and people respected you

1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000
 and you would hear about this blog over here and there's this whole

1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000
 distributed curation and filtering going on

1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000
 so if you think like the 2004

1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000
 presidential election

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000
 most of the information people are getting from the internet

1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000
 was one of the first big internet news

1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.000
 driven elections was from

1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000
 you know you had like the daily costs

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000
 and drudge but there was like

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000
 blogs that were out there and this was back

1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.000
 Ezra Klein was just running a blog out of his

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000
 you know dorm room at this point right

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000
 and you would in a distributed

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000
 fashion gain

1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000
 credibility because okay

1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000
 people have paid it it's very hard to pay attention to a blog

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.000
 or pay attention I get linked to this

1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.000
 kid Ezra or whatever it seems to be really sharp

1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:30.000
 and now people are noticing it

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000
 and now you have a distributed curation

1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000
 that solves a lot of the problems we see

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.000
 when you have a completely homogenized low friction

1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000
 environment like friction where

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.000
 Twitter where any random conspiracy

1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.000
 theory or whatever that people like

1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.000
 can just shoot through and spread

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.000
 whereas if you're starting a

1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000
 blog to try to push QAnon

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000
 or something like that it's probably

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000
 going to be a really weird looking blog and you're going to have a hard time

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000
 like it's just never going to show up on people's

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000
 radar right so

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000
 everything you've said up until the very

1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000
 last statement I would agree with

1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000
 this is a topic I don't know a ton about

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:04.000
 I guess QAnon

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000
 I think

1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000
 QAnon

1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.000
 QAnon could be that

1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000
 I also don't know I should know more

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000
 I apologize I don't know more

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000
 I mean that's a power and

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000
 the downside

1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000
 Hitler could have

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000
 a blog today and he

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000
 would have potentially a very large following

1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000
 if he's charismatic

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000
 if he's good with

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000
 words is able to express the ideas

1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000
 whatever maybe is able to channel

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000
 the frustration and anger that people have about

1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000
 a certain thing and so

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000
 I think that's the power of blogs but it's also

1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.000
 the limitation but that doesn't

1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:42.000
 we're not trying to solve that you can't solve that

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000
 the fundamental problem you're saying is not the problem

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000
 your

1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:48.000
 thesis is that there's nothing special

1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000
 about large scale social

1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:52.000
 networks that guarantees

1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:54.000
 that they will keep existing and it's

1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000
 important to remember for a lot of the older

1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000
 generation of internet activists

1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000
 so the people who are very pro internet in the early days

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000
 they were

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000
 completely flabbergasted by

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:06.000
 the rise of these platforms

1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000
 say why would you

1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000
 take the internet and then build your own version of the internet

1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000
 where you own all the servers

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000
 and we built this whole

1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000
 distribute the whole thing we had open protocols

1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000
 everyone anywhere in the world

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000
 use the same protocols your machine can talk to any other machine

1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000
 it's the most democratic

1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:24.000
 communication system that's ever been built

1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000
 and then these companies came along and said we're going to build our own

1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000
 let's own all the servers and put them in

1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000
 buildings that we own and the internet will just be

1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000
 the first mile this gets you into our private

1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.000
 internet where we own the whole thing

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000
 completely against the entire

1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000
 motivation

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000
 of the internet was like yes we it's not going to be

1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.000
 one person owns all the servers and you pay to access them

1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000
 it's anyone server that they own

1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000
 can talk to anyone else's server because we all agree on

1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000
 a standard set of protocols

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000
 and so the the old guard of

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000
 pro internet people

1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000
 never understood this move towards

1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.000
 let's build private versions of the internet

1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000
 we'll build

1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000
 three or four private internet and that's what we'll all use

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000
 it was the opposite basically

1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.000
 well it's funny enough I don't know if you follow

1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000
 but Jack Dorsey is also

1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000
 is a proponent

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000
 and is helping to fund

1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000
 create fully distributed versions

1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.000
 of Twitter essentially I think

1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000
 would potentially destroy Twitter

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000
 but I think there might be financial

1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000
 business

1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000
 cases to be made there I'm not sure

1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000
 but that seems to be another alternative

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000
 as opposed to creating

1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000
 a bunch of

1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000
 like the long tail

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000
 creating like the ultimate long tail

1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000
 of like fully distributed

1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000
 which is what the internet is

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000
 I'm thinking about long tail social media

1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000
 I'm thinking it's

1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000
 like the text not so important

1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000
 like there's groups out there

1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000
 where the tech they use

1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000
 to actually implement their digital only social group

1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000
 whatever they might use Slack

1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000
 Zoom or it doesn't matter I think in the tech world

1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:54.000
 we want to build the beautiful protocol

1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000
 that okay everyone's going to use

1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000
 as just a federated server

1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000
 protocol in which we've worked out X Y and Z

1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000
 and no one understands it because then the engineers needed all

1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.000
 to make I get it because I'm a nerd like this like okay

1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:06.000
 every standard has to fit with everything else

1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.000
 and no one understands what's going on

1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000
 meanwhile you know you have this group of

1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000
 bike enthusiasts that are like yeah we'll just

1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000
 jump on to Zoom and have some Slack and put up a blog

1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000
 and the tech doesn't really matter

1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000
 like we built the world with our own curation

1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.000
 rules

1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000
 our own sort of social ecosystem

1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000
 that's generating a lot of value

1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000
 I don't know if it'll happen there's a lot of money at stake

1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000
 with obviously these large

1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000
 but I just think they're more

1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000
 I mean look how quickly Americans left

1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000
 Facebook right

1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.000
 I mean Facebook was savvy to buy other properties

1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000
 and diversify right but how quick did that take

1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000
 for just standard

1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000
 Facebook news feed everyone under the age

1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000
 of something we're using it and no one under a certain age

1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000
 is using it now it took like four years

1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000
 really

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000
 I believe people can leave

1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000
 Facebook overnight

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000
 I think Facebook hasn't actually

1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000
 messed up

1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.000
 there's two things

1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000
 they haven't messed up enough for people to really leave

1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000
 aggressively and there's no good alternative

1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000
 for them to leave

1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000
 I think if good alternatives pop up

1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000
 it would just immediately happen

1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000
 the stuff is a lot more culturally fragile I think

1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:12.000
 I mean Twitter's having a moment because it was

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000
 feeding a certain type of

1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:16.000
 righties that was in the sort of political sphere anyways

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000
 that Twitter was

1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000
 working with

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.000
 but its moment could go to as well

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000
 I mean it's a really arbitrary thing

1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000
 short little things and I read a wired article

1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000
 about this earlier in the pandemic like this is crazy

1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000
 that the way that

1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000
 we're trying to communicate information about the pandemic

1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000
 is in all these weird arbitrary rules

1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000
 where people are screen shotting

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000
 pictures of articles that are part of a tweet

1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000
 thread where you say one slash in

1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.000
 under it like we have the technology guys

1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.000
 so like really

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000
 clearly convey long form

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000
 information to people like why do we have these

1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000
 and I know it's because it's the gamified dopamine hits

1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000
 but what a weird medium

1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000
 there's no reason for us to have to

1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000
 have these threads that you have to

1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:58.000
 find and pin with your screen shot

1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000
 I mean we have technology to communicate better using the internet

1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000
 I mean why are epidemiologists

1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000
 having to do tweet

1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000
 threads because there's mechanisms

1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000
 of publishing that make it easier on Twitter

1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000
 I mean we're evolving as a species

1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000
 and the internet is a very fresh thing

1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000
 and so

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000
 it's kind of interesting to think

1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.000
 that as opposed to Twitter

1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000
 this is what Jack also complains about

1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000
 is Twitter is not innovating fast enough

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000
 and so

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000
 it's almost like the people are

1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:28.000
 innovating and thinking about

1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000
 their productive life faster

1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000
 than the platforms in which

1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000
 they operate can catch up and so

1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000
 at the point the gap grows

1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.000
 sufficiently they'll jump

1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.000
 a few people

1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000
 a few innovative folks will just create an alternative

1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000
 and perhaps

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000
 distributed perhaps just

1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.000
 many little silos

1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.000
 and then people will jump and then we'll just continue this kind of way

1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000
 I think like Substack for example

1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.000
 what they're going to pull out of Twitter among other things

1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000
 is the audience that was

1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.000
 let's say like slightly left of

1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.000
 center but

1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:02.000
 slightly left of center

1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:04.000
 don't like Trump uncomfortable with

1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:06.000
 like postmodern critical theories made into

1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:08.000
 political action right

1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:10.000
 and they're like yeah Twitter there was a people on there talking about this

1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:12.000
 and it made me feel

1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.000
 heard because I was feeling a little bit like a nerd

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000
 about it but honestly I'd probably rather subscribe

1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:18.000
 the four subs you know I'm going to have like

1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:20.000
 Barry's and Andrew Sullivan's I'll have like a

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:22.000
 Jesse signals like I'll have a few sub stacks

1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.000
 I can subscribe to and honestly that's

1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:26.000
 I'm a knowledge worker who's

1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:28.000
 32 anyways probably that's an email all day

1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:30.000
 and so like there's an innovation that's going to

1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:32.000
 that group you know it's going to suck

1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:34.000
 them off which is actually a very large group

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:36.000
 yeah that's a lot of that's a lot of energy

1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:38.000
 and then once Trump's gone I guess that's probably

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000
 going to drive that drove a lot of

1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000
 more like Trump people off Twitter

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.000
 like this stuff is fragile I think

1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.000
 so I but the fascinating

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:48.000
 thing to me because I've hung out on parlor

1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:50.000
 for a short amount

1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.000
 enough to know that the interface

1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:54.000
 matters it's so fascinating like that

1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:56.000
 that it's not just about ideas

1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:58.000
 yeah it's about

1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:00.000
 creating like Substack too

1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:02.000
 creating a pleasant

1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:04.000
 experience a dicting

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:06.000
 experience you're right you're right about that and it's hard

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000
 and it's why the end this is one of the conclusions

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:10.000
 from that indie social media article is

1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:12.000
 it's just the ugliness matters

1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:14.000
 and I don't mean even just aesthetically but just the clunkiness

1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:16.000
 of the interfaces the

1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:18.000
 and I don't know it's

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:20.000
 the some degree the social media companies have spent a

1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:22.000
 lot of money on this and the some degree it's

1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:24.000
 a survivorship bias yeah right I think

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.000
 Twitter every time I hear Jack

1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:28.000
 talks about this it seems like

1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:30.000
 he's as surprised as anyone else

1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:32.000
 the way Twitter is being used I mean it's basically

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:34.000
 the way you know they had

1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:36.000
 it years

1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.000
 ago and then you know it was great

1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:40.000
 it'll be statuses right yeah this is what I'm

1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:42.000
 doing you know and my friends can follow me

1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:44.000
 and see it and without really changing anything it just happened

1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:46.000
 to hit everything right

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:48.000
 to support this other type of interaction well there's

1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:50.000
 also the JavaScript model which

1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:52.000
 Bernard and I talked about he just implemented

1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:54.000
 JavaScript like the crappy

1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:56.000
 version of JavaScript in 10 days throughout

1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:58.000
 there and just

1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:00.000
 changed it really quickly yeah

1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.000
 involved it really quickly and now it's

1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.000
 become according to stack exchange

1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.000
 the most popular programming language in the world

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.000
 yeah it drives like most of the internet

1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.000
 and even the back end and now mobile

1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:12.000
 yeah and so that that's an argument

1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:14.000
 for the kind of

1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:16.000
 thing you're talking about where like

1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:18.000
 the bike club people yeah

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:20.000
 could literally create the thing that would

1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:22.000
 you know run

1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.000
 most of the internet yeah 10 years from now

1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:26.000
 yeah so

1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:28.000
 there's something to that like as opposed

1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:30.000
 to trying to get lucky or trying to think

1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:32.000
 through stuff is just to

1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:34.000
 solve a particular problem do stuff yeah

1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:36.000
 and do stuff do something like keep tinkering

1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:38.000
 till you love it yeah yeah and

1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:40.000
 then of course the sad thing

1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000
 is timing and luck matter

1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:44.000
 and that you can't really control that's the

1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:46.000
 problem yeah but you can't go

1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:48.000
 back to 2007 yeah that's

1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:50.000
 like the number one thing you could do to have a lot of

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:52.000
 success with the new platform is go back

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.000
 in time 14 years so the

1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.000
 thing you have to kind of think about is what is

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:58.000
 the like what's the totally new

1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:00.000
 thing that

1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:02.000
 10 years from now would seem

1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.000
 obvious I mean some people saying clubhouse

1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:06.000
 is that there's been a lot of

1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:08.000
 stuff like clubhouse before yeah

1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.000
 but it it hit

1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:12.000
 the right kind of thing

1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:14.000
 similar to Tesla actually

1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:16.000
 what clubhouse did is it got a lot of

1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:18.000
 relatively famous people on

1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:20.000
 there quickly and

1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.000
 and then the the other

1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.000
 fact is like it's invite only

1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:26.000
 so like oh all the

1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.000
 famous people are on there I wonder what's

1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:30.000
 it's the FOMO like

1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:32.000
 fear that you're missing something really profound

1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000
 there's exciting happening there

1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:36.000
 so those social effects

1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:38.000
 and then once you actually show up

1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:40.000
 I'm a huge fan of this

1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:42.000
 it's the javascript model is like

1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:44.000
 clubhouse is so dumb

1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:46.000
 like so simple in its interface

1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:48.000
 like you literally can't do anything except

1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:50.000
 mute on mute

1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:52.000
 as a mute button yeah and there's

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.000
 a leave quietly button yeah that's it

1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:56.000
 yeah and it's it's kind of

1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:58.000
 I love single use technology

1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:00.000
 that sense yeah there's

1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:02.000
 no like there's no

1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:04.000
 it's just like

1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:06.000
 trivial and

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:08.000
 you know Twitter kind of started like

1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:10.000
 that Facebook started like that

1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:12.000
 but they've evolved quickly to add all these features

1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:14.000
 and so on and

1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:16.000
 you know I do hope clubhouse stays that way

1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:18.000
 yeah be interesting or there's alternatives

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:20.000
 I mean I get I mean even with clubhouse

1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:22.000
 though the so one of the issues

1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:24.000
 with a lot of these platforms I think is

1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:26.000
 bits are cheap enough

1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:28.000
 now that

1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:30.000
 we don't really need a unicorn

1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.000
 investor model I mean the investors need

1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:34.000
 that model there's really not

1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.000
 really an imperative

1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000
 of we need something

1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000
 that can scale to

1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.000
 100 million plus a year revenue

1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:44.000
 so because it was going to require this much

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:46.000
 seed and angel investment and

1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000
 you're not going to get this much seed and angel investment

1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000
 unless you can have a potential exit

1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000
 this this wide because you have to be part of a portfolio

1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:54.000
 that depends on one out of ten exiting

1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.000
 here if you don't actually need

1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000
 that and you don't need

1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.000
 to satisfy that investor model which I

1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000
 think is basically the case I mean

1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.000
 bits are so cheap everything is so cheap

1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.000
 you don't necessarily even like with clubhouse

1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000
 it's investor backed right this notion of like

1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000
 this needs to be a major platform

1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000
 but the bike club

1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000
 doesn't necessarily need a major platform

1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:16.000
 that's where I'm interested I mean I don't know

1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.000
 there's so much money that's the only problem that bets against

1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000
 me is that you can concentrate

1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.000
 a lot of capital if you do these

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000
 things right I mean so Facebook was like

1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.000
 a fantastic capital concentration

1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.000
 machine it's crazy how much

1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:30.000
 where it even found that capital in the world

1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000
 that it could concentrate and ossify in the stock price

1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000
 that a very small number of people have

1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.000
 you know access to right that's

1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000
 incredibly powerful so when there's

1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000
 a possibility to

1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000
 consolidate and gather a huge amount of capital

1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000
 that's a huge imperative that's very hard

1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000
 for the bike club to go up again so

1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000
 but there's a lot of money in the bike club

1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000
 you should see with the wall street bets

1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000
 and that when a bunch of people

1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000
 get together I mean it doesn't

1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000
 have to be a bike it could be a bunch of different bike clubs

1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000
 just kind of team up

1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000
 to overtake is what we're doing now

1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000
 or we're going to repurpose off the shelf

1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000
 stuff that's not

1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000
 we're going to repurpose whatever

1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000
 it was for office productivity or something

1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.000
 like the clubs using Slack just to build

1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:12.000
 out these you know yeah

1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000
 let's talk about email

1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000
 yeah that's right I

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.000
 wrote a book you're

1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000
 yet another amazing

1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000
 book a world without

1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000
 email maybe one way to enter

1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000
 this discussion is to ask what is

1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000
 the hyperactive hive mind

1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000
 which is the concept you open the book with yeah

1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.000
 and the devil

1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000
 it's the scourge of hundreds

1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.000
 of millions so

1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000
 I think so

1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000
 I called this book a world without email

1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000
 the real title should be a world without the hyperactive

1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000
 hive mind workflow

1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000
 but my publisher didn't like that

1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.000
 so we had to get a little bit more pithy

1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.000
 I was trying to answer the question after deep work

1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000
 why is it so hard to do this

1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000
 like if this is so valuable

1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000
 if we can produce much higher if people are much

1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000
 happier

1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000
 why do we check email a day why are we on Slack all day

1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000
 you know and so I started working on this

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000
 book immediately after deep work

1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000
 and so my initial interviews were done in

1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000
 2016 so it took five years

1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000
 to pull the threads together I was trying to understand

1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000
 why is it so hard for

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000
 most people to actually find any time

1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000
 to do the stuff that actually moves the needle

1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000
 and the story was and I thought this was

1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000
 I hadn't heard this reported anywhere else

1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000
 that's why it took me so long to pull it together

1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000
 is email arrives on the scene

1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000
 email spreads I trace it

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000
 it really picks up steam in the early 1990s

1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000
 between like 1990

1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000
 and 1995 it makes its move right

1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000
 and it does so for very pragmatic reasons

1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000
 it was replacing existing communication

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000
 technologies that it was better than it was mainly

1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000
 the fax machine voicemail and memos right so

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000
 this was just better right so it was

1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000
 a killer app because it was useful

1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000
 in its wake

1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000
 came a new way of collaborating

1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000
 and that's the hyperactive hive mind so it's

1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000
 the like the virus that follows

1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000
 the the rats that

1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000
 went through western Europe for the black pig as

1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000
 email spread through organizations in

1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000
 its wake came the hyperactive hive mind

1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000
 workflow which says okay guys here's the way

1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000
 we're going to collaborate we'll just work

1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000
 things out on the fly with unscheduled

1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000
 back and forth messages just boom boom boom

1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000
 let's go back and forth hey what about this

1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000
 you see this what about that client let's see

1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000
 what's going on over here that followed

1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000
 email it completely took over

1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000
 office work

1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000
 and the the need

1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000
 to keep up with all these asynchronous

1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000
 back and forth unscheduled messages

1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000
 as those got more and more and more we had more

1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000
 there's a service the need to service those

1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000
 requires to check more and more and more

1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000
 right and so by the time and I go through

1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:34.000
 the numbers by the time you get to today

1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000
 now the average knowledge worker has to check one

1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000
 of these channels once every six minutes

1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.000
 every single thing you do in your organization

1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000
 how you talk to your colleagues how you talk

1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000
 to your vendors how you talk to your clients how

1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000
 you talk to the HR department it's all this

1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000
 asynchronous unscheduled back and forth messaging

1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000
 and you have to service the conversations

1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000
 and it spiraled out of control and it has

1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000
 sort of devolved a lot of work in the office

1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000
 now to all I do is constantly tend

1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000
 communication channels

1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000
 so it's fascinating what you're describing

1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000
 is

1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000
 nobody ever paused in this whole

1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000
 evolution

1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.000
 to try to create a system that actually works

1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000
 that it was

1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000
 kind of like a huge fan of cellular

1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000
 automata so it's just kind of started

1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000
 yeah very

1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000
 a very simple mechanism just like cellular

1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000
 automata just kind of grew to overtake

1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000
 all the fundamental

1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000
 communication of how we do business

1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000
 and also personal life yeah that's one of

1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000
 the big ideas is that

1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000
 the unintentionality yeah right so this goes

1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000
 back to technological determinism and this

1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000
 is a weird business book because I go deep

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000
 on philosophy I go deep

1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000
 on for some reason we get in the paleoanthropology

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000
 for a while we do a lot of neuroscience

1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000
 it's kind of a weird book

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000
 but I got real into this technological determinism

1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000
 right this notion that just the presence

1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000
 of a technology can change how people act

1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000
 that's my big argument about what happened

1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000
 with the hive mind and I can document

1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000
 specific examples

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000
 right so I document this example in IBM

1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000
 1987

1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000
 maybe 85

1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000
 but isn't like the mid to late 80s IBM

1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000
 our monk headquarters we're going to put

1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000
 an internal email right because

1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000
 it's convenient and so

1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000
 they ran a whole study and so I talked to

1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000
 the engineer who ran this study Adrian

1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000
 Stuntley we're going to run this study to figure out how much

1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000
 do we communicate because it was still an era where

1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000
 it's expensive right so you

1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000
 have to provision a mainframe so you can't

1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000
 over provision like we want to know how much communication

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000
 actually happened so they went and figured it out

1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000
 how many memos how many calls how many notes

1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000
 great we'll provision a mainframe

1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000
 to handle email that can handle all of that

1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000
 so if all of our communication moves to email

1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000
 the mainframe will still be fine

1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.000
 in three days they had melted it down

1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000
 people were communicating six times more

1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000
 than that estimate so just in

1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000
 three days the presence

1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000
 of a low friction digital communication tool

1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000
 drastically changed how everyone collaborated

1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000
 so that's not enough time for

1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000
 you know in all hands meeting guys we figured

1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000
 it out you know this is what we need to communicate

1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000
 a lot more is what's going to make us

1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000
 more productive we need more emails it's emergent

1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000
 isn't that

1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000
 just on a positive end amazing to you

1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000
 like isn't

1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000
 email amazing like in those early days

1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000
 like just a frictionless communication

1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000
 I mean

1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000
 email is awesome like

1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000
 people say that there's a lot of

1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000
 problems with emails just like people say a

1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000
 lot of problems with Twitter and so on it's kind

1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000
 of cool that you can just send a little note

1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000
 it was a miracle right so

1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000
 I wrote a

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000
 there's originally was a New Yorker piece from

1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000
 a year or two ago called was email a mistake

1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000
 and then it's in the book too

1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000
 but I go into the history

1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000
 of email like why did it come along

1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000
 and it solved a huge

1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000
 problem so it was the problem of fast

1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000
 asynchronous communication and

1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000
 it was a problem that did not exist until we got large offices

1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000
 we got large offices

1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000
 synchronous communication like let's get on the phone

1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000
 at the same time there's too much overhead to it

1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000
 too many people you might have to talk to

1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000
 asynchronous communication like let me send you a memo

1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000
 when I'm ready and you can read it when you're ready

1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000
 took too long and so it was like

1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000
 a huge problem so one of the things I talked about

1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000
 is the way that when they built the CIA

1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000
 headquarters there's such a need for

1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000
 fast asynchronous communication

1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000
 that they built a pneumatic powered

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000
 email system they had these pneumatic tubes

1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000
 all throughout the headquarters with

1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000
 electromagnetic routers so you would put

1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000
 your message in a plexiglass

1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000
 tube and you would turn these brass dials

1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000
 about the location you would stick it in these

1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000
 things and pneumatic tubes and it would shoot

1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000
 and sort and work its way through these tubes

1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000
 to show up in just a minute

1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000
 or something at the floor and at the general

1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000
 office suite where you wanted to go

1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000
 and my point is the fact that they spent so much

1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000
 money to make that work show how important

1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000
 fast asynchronous communication

1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000
 was to large offices so when email came along

1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000
 it was a

1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000
 productivity silver bullet it was a miracle

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000
 I talked to the researchers who were working on

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000
 computer supported collaboration in the late 80s

1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000
 to figure out how are we going to use computer

1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000
 networks to be more productive and they were

1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000
 building all these systems and tools email

1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000
 showed up it just wiped all that research off

1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000
 the map there's no need to build these

1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000
 custom intranet applications there's no need

1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000
 to build these these communication platforms

1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000
 email could just do everything

1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000
 right so it was a

1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000
 miracle application which is why it spread

1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000
 everywhere that's one of these things where

1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000
 okay unintended consequences right you had

1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000
 this miracle productivity silver bullet it

1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000
 spread everywhere but it was so

1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000
 effective it just you know I don't know like

1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000
 a drug I'm sure there's some pandemic

1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000
 metaphor here analogy here

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000
 of a drug that like it's so effective at treating

1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000
 this that it also blows up your whole immune system

1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000
 and then everyone gets sick but well ultimately

1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000
 it probably significantly increased the productivity

1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000
 of the world but there's a kind of hump

1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000
 that it now is plateaued

1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000
 and then forward the

1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000
 fundamental question you're asking is like

1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000
 okay how do we take the next how do we

1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000
 keep increasing the productivity

1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000
 I think it brought it down so my

1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000
 contention and

1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000
 so again there's a little bit in the book

1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000
 I have a more recent wired article

1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000
 that put some newer numbers to this

1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000
 I subscribe to the hypothesis that

1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000
 the hyperactive hive mind was so detrimental

1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000
 so yeah it helped

1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000
 productivity at first right when you could

1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.000
 do fascinicos communication but very

1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.000
 quickly there was a sort of exponential

1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:00.000
 rise in communication amounts

1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:02.000
 once we got to the point where the hive mind

1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:04.000
 meant you had to constantly check your email

1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:06.000
 I think that made us so unproductive

1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:08.000
 that it actually was pulling down

1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:10.000
 non industrial productivity and I think the only

1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.000
 reason why so it certainly has not been

1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.000
 going up that metrics been stagnating

1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:16.000
 for a long time now while all this was going

1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.000
 on I think the only reason why it hasn't

1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:20.000
 fallen is that we added these

1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:22.000
 extra shifts off the books

1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000
 I'm gonna work for three hours in the morning

1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:26.000
 I'm gonna work for three hours at night and only

1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:28.000
 that I think has allowed us to basically

1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:30.000
 maintain a stagnated

1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:32.000
 non industrial growth it we should have been

1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000
 shooting up the charts I mean this is

1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:36.000
 miraculous innovations the computer

1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:38.000
 networks and then we built out these hundred billion

1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:40.000
 dollar ubiquitous worldwide high

1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:42.000
 speed wireless internet infrastructure

1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000
 with supercomputers in our pockets where we could talk to

1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000
 anyone at any time like why did our

1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.000
 productivity not shoot off the charts because our brain

1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000
 can't context which once every six minutes so it's

1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:52.000
 fundamentally back to the context switching

1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.000
 in context switching

1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000
 is poison it's the what

1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000
 is it about email that forces context

1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:00.000
 switching is it both our psychology that

1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:02.000
 drags us in yeah no expectation

1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000
 yeah right right because it's not

1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:06.000
 I think we've seen this through a personal

1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.000
 a personal will or failure

1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000
 lens recently like oh my addicted

1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:12.000
 to email yes I have

1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.000
 bad etiquette about my email

1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000
 no it's the underlying workflow

1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.000
 so the tool itself I will

1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000
 exonerate right I think

1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000
 I would rather use pop three than

1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000
 a fax protocol right I think it's easier

1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.000
 the issue is the hyperactive

1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000
 hive mind workflow so if I am now collaborating

1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000
 with 20 or 30 different people

1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:32.000
 with back and forth unscheduled

1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:34.000
 messaging I have to tend those conversations

1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:36.000
 right it's like you have 30

1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.000
 metaphorical ping pong tables and when the

1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000
 balls come back across you have to pretty soon

1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000
 hit it back or stuff actually

1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000
 grinds to a halt so it's the

1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:46.000
 workflow that's the problem it's not the tool

1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000
 it's the fact that we use it to do all of our

1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000
 collaboration let's just send messages back and forth

1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000
 which means you can't be far from checking

1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.000
 that because if you take a break

1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:56.000
 if you batch if you try to have better habits

1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000
 it's going to slow things down so

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000
 my whole villain is this

1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:02.000
 hyperactive hive mind workflow

1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000
 the tool is fine I don't want the tool

1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000
 to go away but I want to replace

1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000
 the hyperactive hive mind workflow I think this is going to be

1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000
 one of the biggest

1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000
 value generating productivity

1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000
 revolutions of the 21st century

1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000
 I quote an anonymous CEO

1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:18.000
 is pretty well known who says this is going to be the

1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000
 moonshop of the 21st century is going to be

1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000
 of that importance there's so much latent

1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000
 productivity that's being suppressed

1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000
 because we just figure things out on the fly

1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000
 and email that as we figure that out I think

1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000
 it's going to be

1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000
 hundreds of billions of dollars

1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000
 you're so

1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.000
 absolutely right the

1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000
 question is what is the world

1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000
 without email look like how do we fix email

1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000
 so what happens is

1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.000
 at least in my vision

1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000
 you identify well

1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000
 actually there's these different processes

1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000
 that make up my work day like these are things

1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000
 that I do repeatedly

1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.000
 often in collaboration with other people that do

1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.000
 useful things for my company or whatever

1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:58.000
 right now most of these processes

1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.000
 are implicitly implemented with the hyperactive hive mind

1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:02.000
 how do we do this thing like answering

1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.000
 client questions to shoot messages back and forth

1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.000
 how do we do this thing posting podcast

1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000
 episodes we'll just figure it out on the fly

1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.000
 my main argument is we actually have to do like they do

1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000
 in the industrial sector take each of these

1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000
 processes and say is there a better way to do

1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:16.000
 this and by better I mean

1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:18.000
 a way that's going to minimize the need to have unscheduled

1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000
 back and forth messaging so we actually

1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.000
 have to do process engineering

1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.000
 this created a massive growth and productivity

1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000
 in the industrial sector during the 20th century

1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000
 we have to do it in knowledge work we can't just rock and roll

1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:30.000
 an inbox as we actually have to say

1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:32.000
 how do we deal with client questions well let's put in place

1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:34.000
 a process that doesn't require us to

1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.000
 send messages back and forth how do we post podcast

1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:38.000
 episodes let's automate this to a degree where

1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:40.000
 I don't have to just send you a message on the fly

1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:42.000
 and you do this

1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:44.000
 process by process and the pressure on that

1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.000
 inbox is released and now you don't have to check it

1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.000
 every six minutes you still have email I mean

1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:50.000
 like I need to send you a file sure I'll use email

1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:52.000
 but we're not coordinating or collaborating over

1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.000
 email or Slack which is just a faster

1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.000
 way of doing the hive mind I mean Slack doesn't

1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:58.000
 solve anything there you

1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.000
 have better structured bespoke processes

1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000
 I think that's what's going to unleash this

1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.000
 massive productivity the spoke so

1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:06.000
 the interesting thing is like for example

1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.000
 you and I exchanged some emails so obviously

1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:10.000
 I for let's just say

1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:12.000
 my particular case I schedule podcasts there's

1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:14.000
 a bunch of different tasks fascinating

1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000
 enough that I

1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:18.000
 do that could be converted into processes

1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.000
 yeah is it up to me

1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:22.000
 to create that process or do you

1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:24.000
 think we also need to build tools just like

1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:26.000
 email was a protocol

1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:28.000
 for helping us

1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000
 create process for the different

1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:32.000
 tasks I mean I think ultimately

1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:34.000
 the whole organization

1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000
 whole team has to be involved I think ultimately

1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.000
 there's certainly a lot of investor money being

1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.000
 spent right now to try to figure out those tools

1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:42.000
 right so I think Silicon Valley has figured this out

1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.000
 in the past couple of years this is the difference between

1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.000
 when I was talking to people after

1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.000
 deep work and now five years later

1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000
 is this

1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000
 scent is in the air right because there's so much

1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.000
 latent productivity so yes there are going to be

1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.000
 new tools which I think could help there are already

1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000
 tools that exist I mean in

1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:00.000
 the different groups I profile use things like

1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000
 Trello or Basecamp or Asana

1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.000
 or Flow and you know

1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.000
 our schedule wants and acuity like there's

1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000
 there's a lot of tools out there

1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000
 the key is not to think about it in terms

1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000
 of what tool do I replace email with instead

1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000
 you think about it with

1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000
 I have a pro we're trying to come with a process

1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:18.000
 that reduces back and forth messages oh what

1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:20.000
 tool might help us

1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.000
 might help us do that yeah and I would

1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:24.000
 push it's not about necessarily efficiency in

1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000
 fact some of these things are going to take more time

1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000
 so writing a letter to someone

1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000
 is like a high value activity it's probably

1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000
 worth doing the thing that's killer is

1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.000
 the back and forth because now I have

1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000
 the key to checking right so we scheduled

1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000
 this together because I knew you from

1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000
 before but like most of the interviews

1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000
 I was scheduling for this actually

1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000
 I have a process with my publicist where we

1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000
 use a shared document and she put stuff

1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000
 in there and then I check it twice a week

1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000
 and there's scheduling options

1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000
 I say here's what I want to do this one or this will work for this one

1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000
 or whatever and it takes more time in the moment

1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000
 than just but it means that we

1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000
 have almost no back and forth messaging

1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000
 for podcast scheduling which without

1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000
 this so like with my UK publisher

1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000
 I didn't put this process in the place because

1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000
 we're not doing as many interviews

1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000
 but it's all the time and I'm like oh

1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000
 I could really feel the difference right

1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000
 it's the back and forth that's killer

1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000
 I suppose it is up to the individual

1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000
 people involved like you said

1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000
 knowledge workers

1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000
 like they have to carry the responsibility

1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000
 of

1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:24.000
 creating processes like how

1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000
 always asking the first principles question

1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000
 how couldn't this be converted into a process

1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000
 yeah so you can start by doing this yourself

1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000
 like just with what you can control

1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000
 I think ultimately once the teams

1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000
 are doing that I think that's probably the right scale

1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000
 if you try to do this at the organizational scale

1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000
 you're going to get bureaucracy right

1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.000
 so if it's you know right if

1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000
 Elon Musk is going to dictate

1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000
 down to everyone at Tesla

1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000
 or something like this that's too much remove

1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000
 you get bureaucracy but if it's we're a team of six

1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000
 that's working together

1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000
 on you know whatever power

1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000
 train software then we can figure out on our own

1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000
 what are our processes how do we want to do this

1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000
 so it's ultimately also creating a culture

1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000
 where saying like an email

1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000
 sending an email just for the hell of it it should

1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000
 be taboo like yeah so like

1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000
 you are being

1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000
 you're being destructive

1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000
 to the productivity of the team by sending the email

1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000
 as opposed to

1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000
 helping develop a

1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000
 process and so on that

1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000
 that will ultimately

1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000
 automate this that's why I'm trying to spread

1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000
 this message of the context which is as poison

1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000
 I get so much into the science of it I think we underestimate

1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000
 how much it kills us

1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000
 to have to wrench away our context look at a message

1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000
 and come back and so once you have the mindset

1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000
 of it's a huge thing to ask

1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000
 of someone to have to

1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000
 take their attention off something and look back at this

1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000
 and if they have to do that for three or four

1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000
 times like we're just going to figure this out on the fly

1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000
 and every message is going to require five checks

1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000
 of the inbox while you wait for it well you've now you've created

1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000
 whatever it is at this point 25

1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000
 or 30 context shifts

1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000
 like you've just done a huge

1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000
 disservice to someone say this would be like if I had a professional

1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:56.000
 athlete like hey do me a favor

1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000
 I need you to go do this press interview but to get there you're going to have to

1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000
 carry this sandbag and sprint

1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000
 up this hill like completely exhaust your muscles

1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:04.000
 and then you have to go play a game like of course I'm not going to

1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.000
 ask an athlete to do like an incredibly

1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000
 physically demanding thing right before a game

1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000
 but something as easy as

1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000
 thoughts question mark or like hey

1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:14.000
 do you want to jump on a call and it's going to be six

1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000
 back and forth messages to figure it out it's

1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000
 kind of the cognitive equivalent right you're taking

1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000
 the wind out of someone yeah and by the way

1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000
 for people who are listening

1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000
 because I recently posted a few job openings

1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000
 for us so I had to help with this thing

1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000
 and one of the things that

1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000
 people are surprised when they work with me is how many

1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000
 spreadsheets and processes are involved

1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000
 and it's like Claude Shannon right I talked about

1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.000
 communication theory information theory

1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000
 it takes time to come up with a clever code

1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000
 up front so you spend more time up front figuring out

1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:42.000
 those spreadsheets and trying to get people on board

1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.000
 with it but then

1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:46.000
 your communication going forward is all much more efficient

1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:48.000
 so over time you're using

1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:50.000
 much less bandwidth right so

1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:52.000
 you do pain up front

1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000
 it's quicker just right now to send an email

1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000
 but if I spend a half day to do this

1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000
 over the next six months I've saved

1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000
 myself 600 emails

1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:02.000
 now here's a tough question

1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000
 for you know from the computer science perspective

1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000
 we often over optimize

1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000
 so you create processes

1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000
 and you

1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.000
 okay just like you're saying

1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000
 it's so pleasurable

1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000
 to increase

1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000
 in the long

1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000
 term productivity that sometimes

1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000
 you just enjoy that process in itself

1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.000
 by just creating processes

1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000
 and you actually

1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.000
 never

1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.000
 like it has a negative effect

1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000
 on productivity long term because you're too obsessed

1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000
 with the processes

1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:36.000
 is that

1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.000
 a nice problem to have essentially

1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:40.000
 I mean it's a problem

1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.000
 let's look at the one sector that does do this

1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:44.000
 which is developers

1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:46.000
 right so agile methodologies

1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000
 like Scrum or Kanban are

1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:50.000
 basically workflow methodologies that are

1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:52.000
 much better than the hyperactive hive mind

1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:54.000
 but man

1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000
 some of those programmers get pretty obsessive

1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.000
 I don't know if you've ever talked to a whatever level 3

1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000
 Scrum master

1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000
 they get really obsessive about

1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000
 like it has to happen exactly this way

1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000
 and it's probably seven times more complex

1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.000
 than it needs to be

1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000
 I'm hoping that's just because nerds like me

1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000
 like to do that but it's

1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000
 a broadly probably an issue

1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000
 right we have to be careful because you can just go down

1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000
 that fiddling path

1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000
 like so it needs to be here's how we do it

1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:22.000
 let's reduce the messages and let's roll

1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.000
 you can't save yourself

1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000
 through

1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000
 if you can get the process just right

1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:30.000
 so I wrote this article

1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000
 kind of recently called the rise and fall and getting things done

1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:34.000
 and I profiled

1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.000
 this productivity guru

1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000
 named Merlin Mann and I talked about this movement

1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000
 called productivity prawn

1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000
 as like elite speak term

1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000
 in the early 2000s where people just became convinced

1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000
 that if they could combine

1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000
 their productivity systems with software

1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000
 and they could find just the right software

1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000
 just the right configuration where they could offload

1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.000
 most of the difficulty of work what happened

1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000
 with the machine so we kind of figured out

1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000
 and then they could just sort of crank widgets

1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000
 and the whole thing fell apart because

1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.000
 it's work is hard and it's hard to do

1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000
 and making decisions about what to work on is hard

1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000
 and no system can really do that for you

1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000
 so you have to have this

1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000
 this sort of balance between

1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.000
 context switches are poison

1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000
 so we got to get rid of the context switches

1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000
 once like something's working good enough to get rid of the context switches

1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000
 then get after it

1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:20.000
 there's a logical process there for me

1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.000
 the OCD nature

1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000
 I've literally embarrassing enough

1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000
 have lost my shit before

1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000
 when

1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000
 in many of the processes that involve python scripts

1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000
 the rule is

1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000
 to not use

1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000
 spaces

1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000
 there's like rules for how you format stuff

1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.000
 okay

1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:42.000
 and I should not lose my shit

1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000
 when somebody had a space

1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000
 and maybe capital letters

1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000
 it's okay to have a space

1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.000
 because there's this feeling like

1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000
 something's not perfect

1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000
 and as opposed to in the python script

1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000
 allowing some flexibility around that

1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000
 you create this programmatic way

1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000
 that's flawless and when everything's working

1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000
 perfectly it's perfect

1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000
 but actually

1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000
 if you strive for perfection

1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000
 it has the same

1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000
 like it has a lot of the stress

1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.000
 that you were seeking to escape with the context switching

1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000
 because

1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000
 you're almost

1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000
 stressing about errors

1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000
 like when the process is functioning

1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000
 there's always this anxiety of

1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000
 like I wonder if it's gonna

1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000
 succeed

1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:28.000
 I wonder if it's gonna succeed

1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000
 I think some of that's just you and I probably

1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000
 it's just our mindset

1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000
 we do computer science

1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.000
 so chicken and egg

1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000
 and a lot of the processes

1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000
 of working here are much rougher

1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000
 instead of letting clients just

1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.000
 we have a weekly call

1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000
 and then we send them a breakdown of everything we

1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000
 committed to right

1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000
 that's a process that works okay I get asked a lot of questions

1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000
 because I'm the javascript guy in the company

1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.000
 instead of doing that by email I have office hours

1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000
 this is what base camp does

1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000
 you come to my office hours that cuts down a lot of back and forth

1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000
 instead of emailing about this project we'll have

1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000
 a trello board

1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000
 and we'll do a weekly really structure

1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000
 status meeting real quick what's going on

1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000
 who needs what let's go

1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000
 and now everything's on there and on our inboxes

1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.000
 so like that rough level of granularity

1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000
 that gets you most of the way there

1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000
 so the parts that you

1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000
 can't automate and turn into a process

1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.000
 so

1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000
 how many parts like that do you think should

1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000
 remain in a perfect world

1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000
 and

1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.000
 for those parts where email is

1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000
 still useful

1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000
 what do you recommend those emails

1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000
 look like how should you write

1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000
 emails when should you send them

1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000
 yeah I think email is good

1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000
 for delivering information

1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000
 right so I think of it like a fax machine

1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000
 or something you know it's a really good fax machine

1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000
 so if I need to send you something

1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:48.000
 and you just send you a file I need to broadcast a new

1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:50.000
 policy or something like email is a great

1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000
 way to do it it's bad for

1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000
 collaboration so you're having

1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000
 a conversation like we're trying to

1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000
 reach a decision on something I'm trying to learn

1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.000
 about something I'm trying to clarify what something

1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.000
 what what this is that it's more than

1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:04.000
 just like a one answer type question

1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000
 then I think that you shouldn't be doing an email

1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000
 but see here's the thing

1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000
 like you and I

1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000
 don't talk often and so we have a kind

1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000
 of new interaction it's not

1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.000
 so sure

1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:18.000
 yeah you have a book coming out so there's a process

1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000
 and so on but

1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:22.000
 say there don't you think there's a lot of

1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.000
 novel interactive experiences

1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.000
 yeah it's fine so you could just

1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000
 for every novel experience it's okay to

1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000
 have a little bit of exchange it's fine

1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:32.000
 like I think it's fine if stuff comes

1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:34.000
 in over the transom or it's you hear from

1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:36.000
 someone you haven't heard from in a while

1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000
 I think all that's fine I mean

1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000
 that's that's email at its best where it

1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000
 starts to kill us is where all of our

1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.000
 collaboration is happening with the back and forth so when you've

1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:46.000
 moved the bulk of that out of your inbox

1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:48.000
 now you're back in that Meg Ryan movie

1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:50.000
 like you got mail where it's like all right

1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:52.000
 load this up and you wait for the vote I'm like oh

1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:54.000
 we got a message yeah

1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.000
 Lex sent me a message this is interesting right back to

1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:58.000
 the AOL days so you're talking about the bulk

1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.000
 of the the business world

1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:02.000
 where like email has replaced the actual

1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:04.000
 communication

1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.000
 all the communication protocols required to

1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:08.000
 accomplish anything everything is just happening with messages

1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:10.000
 so if you now get most stuff

1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.000
 done repeatable collaborations

1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000
 with with other processes

1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:16.000
 that don't require you to check these inboxes then the inbox

1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:18.000
 can serve like an inbox which

1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:20.000
 includes hearing from interesting people

1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.000
 right or sending something hey I don't

1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000
 know if you saw this I thought you might like it like it's great for that

1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.000
 so there's there's probably

1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:28.000
 a bunch of people listening to this they're like

1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:30.000
 yeah but

1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000
 I work on a team and they're all they use

1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:34.000
 is email how do you start the revolution

1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:36.000
 from like the ground up yeah

1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.000
 well do it a do asymmetric optimization

1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:40.000
 first so identify all your

1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:42.000
 processes and then change what you can change

1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:44.000
 and be socially very careful about it

1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.000
 so don't necessarily say like okay

1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:48.000
 this is a new process we all have to do

1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:50.000
 you're just you know hey we

1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:52.000
 gotta get this report ready here's

1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:54.000
 what I think we should do like I'll get a draft into our Dropbox

1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:56.000
 folder by like noon on Monday

1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:58.000
 grab it I won't

1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:00.000
 touch it again until Tuesday morning

1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:02.000
 and then I'll look at your changes I have this office

1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:04.000
 hours always scheduled Tuesday afternoon so

1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:06.000
 if there's anything that catches your attention grab me

1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:08.000
 then but I've told the designer

1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:10.000
 who cc'd on this that

1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:12.000
 by C.O.B. Tuesday the

1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:14.000
 final version will be ready for them to take and

1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:16.000
 polish or whatever like the person the other is like great

1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:18.000
 I'm glad you know Cal has a plan

1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000
 so I just what I need to do I need to edit this

1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000
 tomorrow whatever right but you've actually pulled them into

1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:24.000
 a process that means we're going to get this report together

1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.000
 without having to just go back and forth you just

1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.000
 asymmetrically optimize these

1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:30.000
 things and then you can

1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:32.000
 begin the conversation and maybe that's where my

1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.000
 book comes in place you just sort of

1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000
 yeah slide it slide it across

1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000
 to buy the book just leave it

1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:40.000
 leave it to everybody on your team

1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000
 okay so we solved the bulk of the email problem

1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:44.000
 of this is there a case to be made that

1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.000
 even for like communication between you and

1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:48.000
 I we should move away

1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:50.000
 from from

1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:52.000
 email and for example there's a guy

1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:54.000
 recently I don't know if you know comedians but there's

1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:56.000
 a guy named Joey Diaz yeah that

1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.000
 I've had an interaction with recently

1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:00.000
 and that guy first of all the sweetest

2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:02.000
 human despite what his comedy

2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:04.000
 sounds like is the sweetest human being

2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:06.000
 and he's a big proponent of just pick up

2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:08.000
 the phone yeah and call

2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:10.000
 yeah and it makes me so uncomfortable

2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:12.000
 people call me yeah it's like I don't know what to

2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:14.000
 do with this thing

2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:16.000
 but it kind of gets everything done

2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:18.000
 quicker I think

2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000
 if I don't move the anxiety from that is

2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000
 there a case to be made for that or his email

2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:24.000
 could still be the most efficient way

2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000
 to do this no I mean look if you have

2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000
 to interact with someone

2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000
 there's a lot of efficiency and synchrony

2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000
 right and this something from the distributed system theory

2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000
 where you know if you go from synchronous to asynchronous

2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000
 networks there's a huge amount of overhead

2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:38.000
 to the asynchronous so actually the protocols required

2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000
 to solve things in asynchronous networks

2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000
 are significantly more complicated

2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000
 and fragile than synchronous protocols

2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000
 so if we can just do real time

2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000
 it's usually better than also from

2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000
 interaction like social connection standpoint

2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000
 there's a lot more information in the human voice

2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000
 in the back and forth

2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000
 yeah if you just call so very generational

2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000
 right like our generation will be comfortable

2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000
 talking on the phone in a way

2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000
 that like a younger generation isn't but an older

2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000
 generation is more comfortable with well

2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000
 you just call people whereas we

2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000
 so there's a happy medium but most of my good friends

2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000
 we just talk we have regular

2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000
 phone calls okay yeah it's not

2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000
 I don't just call them we schedule it we schedule

2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000
 it yeah just on text like yeah you want to talk

2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000
 sometimes soon

2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000
 do you ever have a process around friends

2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000
 not really

2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000
 I feel like I should I feel like

2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000
 when you have like a lot of interesting

2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000
 friend possibilities is you have like

2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000
 an interesting problem right like really interesting

2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000
 people you can talk to

2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000
 well that's that's one problem the other one is the

2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000
 introversion where I'm just afraid

2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000
 of people and get really stressed like

2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000
 I freak out and so you picked a good

2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000
 line of work yeah

2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000
 now perhaps it's the Goggins thing it's

2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000
 like facing your fears whatever

2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000
 but it's almost like

2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000
 there's a

2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000
 it has to do with the timetables thing and the

2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000
 deep work that

2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000
 the nice thing about the processes is

2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000
 it not only

2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000
 automates

2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000
 sort of automates

2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000
 a way the context switching it ensures

2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000
 you do the important things too yeah

2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000
 it's like prioritized so

2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000
 the thing is with email

2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000
 because everything is done over email

2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000
 you can

2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000
 be lazy in the same way with like social

2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000
 networks and and do the

2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000
 easy things first yeah they're not that

2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000
 important so the process

2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000
 also enforces that you do the important

2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000
 things and for me the important

2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000
 things is like

2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000
 it sounds weird but like social connection

2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000
 no that's one of the most important

2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000
 things in all of human existence

2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000
 yeah and doing it

2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000
 the paradoxical thing I got into this

2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000
 for digital minimalism

2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000
 the more you sacrifice on behalf of the

2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000
 connection the stronger the connection feels

2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000
 right so sacrificing non trivial time

2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000
 and attention on behalf of someone

2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000
 is what tells your brain that this is a

2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000
 serious relationship

2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000
 which is why social media had this

2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000
 paradoxical effect of making people feel less

2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000
 social because it took the friction out of

2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000
 it and so the brain just doesn't like yeah

2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000
 you've been commenting on this person's

2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:04.000
 whatever you've been retweeting them or

2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000
 sending them some text you haven't

2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000
 it's not hard enough and then

2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000
 the perceived strength of that social

2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000
 connection diminishes where if you talk to

2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000
 them or go spend time with them or whatever

2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000
 you're going to feel better about it

2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000
 so the friction is good I have

2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000
 a thing with some of my friends where at the end of

2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000
 each call we take a couple minutes to schedule the next

2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000
 then you never it's like I do with

2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000
 haircuts or something right like if I don't

2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000
 schedule it then yeah I'm never going to get

2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000
 my haircut right and so we it's like okay

2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000
 when you want to talk next you know

2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000
 yeah that's really that's a really good idea

2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000
 I just don't call friends

2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000
 and like every 10 years

2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000
 I do something dramatic for them so then

2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000
 we maintain the friendship like I'd murder

2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000
 somebody that they really don't like

2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:46.000
 careful man Joey might ask

2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000
 you to do that

2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000
 oh this is one of my favorite things

2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000
 Lex I need to come down to New Jersey

2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000
 that's exactly what we're going to do

2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000
 with that robot dog of yours

2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000
 we're going to go down to Jersey there's a special

2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000
 human I love the comedian world

2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.000
 they've been shaking up I don't know if you

2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000
 listen to Joe Rogan all those folks

2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000
 they kind of

2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:08.000
 are doing something interesting for

2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000
 MIT and academia

2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.000
 they're shaking up this world

2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000
 a little bit like podcasting

2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000
 because comedians are paving the way for podcasting

2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000
 yeah and so you have like

2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.000
 Andrew Huberman who's a neuroscientist

2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.000
 in front of my now

2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000
 he's like

2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.000
 into podcasting now and

2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000
 you're into podcasting of course you're not

2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000
 necessarily podcasting on computer science

2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000
 currently right yeah but

2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:34.000
 that

2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000
 it feels like you could have a lot of

2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000
 the free spirit

2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000
 of the comedians

2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:42.000
 implemented by the people

2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000
 who are academically trained

2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000
 who actually have a niche

2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000
 specialty yeah and then

2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000
 that results I mean who knows what the

2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000
 experiment looks like but that results

2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000
 me being able to talk about robotics with

2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.000
 your ideas when

2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:58.000
 he says you know drops F bombs

2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:00.000
 every other sentence and

2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:02.000
 the world is like

2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:04.000
 I've seen actually a shift within

2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:06.000
 colleagues and friends within MIT

2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:08.000
 where they're becoming much more

2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.000
 accepting of that kind of thing it's very

2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:12.000
 interesting that's interesting so you're seeing

2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:14.000
 okay because they're seeing how popular

2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:16.000
 it is they're like well you're really popular

2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:18.000
 I don't know how they think about it at

2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:20.000
 Georgetown for example I don't know it's

2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:22.000
 interesting but I think what what happens

2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:24.000
 is the popularity

2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:26.000
 of it combined with

2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.000
 just good conversations with

2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:30.000
 people they respect

2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:32.000
 yeah okay wait this is the

2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.000
 thing yeah and this is more fun

2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:36.000
 to listen to than a shitty zoom

2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:38.000
 lecture yeah

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.000
 about their work yeah it's like there's

2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:42.000
 something here there's something interesting and we don't

2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:44.000
 nobody actually knows what that is

2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.000
 just like with like clubhouse or something

2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:48.000
 nobody's figured out like

2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:50.000
 where is this medium take is this a legitimate medium

2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.000
 of education yeah or

2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000
 is this just like a fun

2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000
 well that's your innovation I think was

2:05:56.000 --> 2:05:58.000
 we can bring on professors

2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:00.000
 yeah and I know Joe Rogan to some of

2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:02.000
 that too but but you know

2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:04.000
 but your professors

2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:06.000
 in your field yeah bring on all these

2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:08.000
 MIT guys who I remember you know

2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:10.000
 well that's been the big challenge for me is

2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:12.000
 I don't is

2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:14.000
 I feel

2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:16.000
 I would I would ask big

2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:18.000
 like philosophical questions of

2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:20.000
 maybe people like yourself

2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:22.000
 they're like really

2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:24.000
 well public like

2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.000
 so for example you have a lot of excellent papers

2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.000
 on

2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.000
 you know that a lot has a lot of

2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000
 theory in it right

2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000
 and there is some temptation to just

2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.000
 go through papers and I think

2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:38.000
 it's possible to actually do that I haven't done that much

2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:40.000
 but I think it's possible it just requires

2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:42.000
 a lot of preparation

2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.000
 and I can probably only do that with things

2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000
 that I'm actually

2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000
 like in the field I'm aware of

2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:50.000
 but there's a dance

2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:52.000
 that I would love to be able to try to hit

2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:54.000
 right where it's actually getting to the core

2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:56.000
 interesting ideas as opposed to just talking

2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000
 about philosophy at the same time

2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000
 there's a large audience of people that

2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:02.000
 just want to be inspired by

2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:04.000
 like by disciplines

2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000
 where they don't necessarily know

2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:08.000
 the details but there's a lot of people

2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.000
 that are like hmm I'm really curious

2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:12.000
 I've been thinking about pivoting

2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:14.000
 careers into software engineering

2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:16.000
 they would love to hear from

2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:18.000
 people like you about computer science

2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:20.000
 even if it's like theory yeah but just

2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000
 like the idea that you can have big ideas

2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.000
 you push them through and it's interesting

2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.000
 you fight for it yeah well there's some

2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000
 there's what is it computer

2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000
 file and

2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000
 number file these YouTube channels

2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:34.000
 there's channels

2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:36.000
 I watch I'm like chess exceptionally popular

2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:38.000
 where I don't

2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:40.000
 I don't understand

2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.000
 maybe 80% of the time what the hell they're talking about

2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:44.000
 because they're talking about like

2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:46.000
 why this move is better than this move but I love

2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.000
 the passion and the genius

2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000
 of those people just overhearing it

2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:52.000
 I don't know why it's so exciting

2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:54.000
 do you look at like Scott Aronson's blog at all

2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:56.000
 the settled optimized yeah it's like

2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:58.000
 hardcore complexity theory

2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:00.000
 but it's just an enthusiasm

2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000
 or like Terry Tao's blog a little bit of humor

2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:04.000
 Terry Tao is a blog

2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.000
 he used to yeah he would

2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:08.000
 and it would just be I'm going all in

2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:10.000
 on you know here's the new affine

2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:12.000
 group with which you can do whatever

2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:14.000
 I mean it was just equations well in the case of Scott

2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000
 Aronson he's good he's able

2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:18.000
 to turn on like the

2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:20.000
 inner troll and comedian

2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:22.000
 and so on yeah he's he keeps the fun

2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:24.000
 which is the best and he's a philosophical guy

2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:26.000
 he wrote that he turns off philosophy

2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:28.000
 yeah yeah so

2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:30.000
 you know we're exploring these different

2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:32.000
 ways of communicating in science and

2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:34.000
 in exciting the world speaking of which

2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000
 I gotta ask you about computer science

2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:38.000
 yeah that's right I do some of that

2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.000
 so I mean

2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:42.000
 a lot of it a lot

2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:44.000
 of your work is what inspired this

2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:46.000
 deep thinking about

2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.000
 that activity from all the different

2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:50.000
 angles because some of the most

2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:52.000
 rigorous work is mathematical work

2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:54.000
 and in computer science that theoretical computer

2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.000
 science let me ask the Scott

2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.000
 Aronson question of like is there

2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:00.000
 something to you that stands out in particular

2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.000
 that's beautiful or inspiring

2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.000
 or just really

2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:06.000
 insightful about computer science

2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:08.000
 or the or maybe mathematics

2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:10.000
 I mean I like

2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:12.000
 theory and in particular

2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:14.000
 what I've always liked in theory is the notion of

2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000
 possibilities that's kind of my specialty

2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.000
 so within the

2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000
 within the context of distributed algorithms

2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.000
 my specialty is impossibility results the idea

2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.000
 that you can argue

2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:26.000
 nothing exists that solves this

2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:28.000
 or nothing exists that can solve this

2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:30.000
 faster than this

2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:32.000
 and that's I think that's really interesting

2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:34.000
 and that goes all the way back to Turing

2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:36.000
 there's his original paper

2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000
 on computable numbers

2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.000
 with their connection to the German

2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:42.000
 problem but basically the German name

2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.000
 that Hilbert called the decision problem

2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000
 this was precomputers but he was

2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:48.000
 you know he's English so it's written in English so it's very accessible paper

2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:50.000
 and it's

2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:52.000
 it lays the foundation for all of theoretical computer science

2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:54.000
 he just has this insight he's like well if we think

2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:56.000
 about like an algorithm he figures out like

2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:58.000
 all effective procedures or Turing

2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:00.000
 machines are basically algorithms we could

2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.000
 really describe a Turing machine with a number

2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:04.000
 which we can now imagine with like computer

2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:06.000
 code you could just take a source file and

2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:08.000
 just treat the binary version of the file as like

2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:10.000
 a really long number right but it's like

2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.000
 every program is just a finite

2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.000
 number it's a natural number

2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000
 and then he realized like one way to think about

2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000
 a problem is you have

2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.000
 this is like kind of the Mike Sipser approach

2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000
 but you have a sort of it's a language

2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000
 so of an infinite number of strings some of them

2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000
 are in the language and some of them aren't but basically

2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.000
 you can imagine a problem is represented as an

2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:30.000
 infinite binary string where in every

2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:32.000
 position like a one means that string is in the

2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000
 language and a zero means it isn't

2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.000
 and then he applied Cantor

2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000
 from the 19th century and said okay

2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000
 natural numbers are countable

2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.000
 so it's countably infinite

2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:44.000
 and infinite binary strings

2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:46.000
 you can use a diagonalization argument and show

2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:48.000
 they're uncountable

2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:50.000
 so there's just vastly more

2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:52.000
 problems than there are algorithms

2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:54.000
 so basically anything you can come up with for the

2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:56.000
 most part almost certainly is not solvable by a computer

2:10:56.000 --> 2:10:58.000
 you know and then and then he was like let me

2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:00.000
 give a particular example and he figured out the

2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:02.000
 very first computability proof and let's just

2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:04.000
 walk through with a little bit of simple logic

2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:06.000
 the halting problem can't be solved by an algorithm

2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:08.000
 and that kicked off the whole

2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:10.000
 enterprise of

2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:12.000
 some things can't be solved by

2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:14.000
 algorithm some things can't be solved by computers

2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:16.000
 and we've just been doing theory on that

2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:18.000
 since the, that was the 30s

2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.000
 he wrote that. So proving that something is impossible

2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:22.000
 is

2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.000
 sort of a more stricter version of that is it like

2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:26.000
 proving bounds on the performance

2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:28.000
 of different algorithms? Yeah so bounds are

2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:30.000
 upper bounds right so you say

2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.000
 this algorithm does

2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:34.000
 at least as well and no worse than this but you're looking

2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:36.000
 at a particular algorithm and possibility proof

2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000
 say no algorithm

2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.000
 ever could ever solve this problem

2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:42.000
 so no algorithm could ever solve the halting problem

2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:44.000
 So it's problem centric

2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.000
 it's making something

2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:48.000
 making a conclusive statement about the

2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:50.000
 problem and that's somehow

2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:52.000
 satisfying because it's

2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:54.000
 philosophically interesting. Yeah I mean it all goes

2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.000
 back to you get back to Plato it's

2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:58.000
 all reducto ad absurdum

2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.000
 so all these arguments have to start the only way to

2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.000
 do it is there's an infinite number of solutions

2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.000
 that you can't go through them as you say let's assume

2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:06.000
 for the sake of contradiction

2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:08.000
 that there existed something that solves this problem

2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:10.000
 and then you turn to crank logic

2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.000
 until you blow up the universe and then you go

2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:14.000
 back and say okay our original assumption

2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:16.000
 that this solution exists can't be true

2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.000
 I just think philosophically it's like a

2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:20.000
 really exciting kind of beautiful thing it's what

2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:22.000
 I specialize in within distributed algorithms

2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:24.000
 is more like time bound

2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:26.000
 and possibility results like no

2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:28.000
 no algorithm can solve this problem faster than this

2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000
 in this setting of all

2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:32.000
 the infinite number of ways you might ever do it.

2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:34.000
 So you have of many papers

2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000
 but the one that caught my eye smooth analysis

2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.000
 of dynamic networks

2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:40.000
 in which you write

2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:42.000
 a problem with the worst

2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000
 case perspective is that it often leads to extremely

2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.000
 strong lower bounds these strong

2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:48.000
 results motivate a key question

2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:50.000
 is this bound robust in the sense that it

2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000
 captures the fundamental difficulty

2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000
 introduced by dynamism

2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:56.000
 or is the bound fragile

2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000
 in the sense that the poor performance it describes

2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:00.000
 depends on an exact sequence

2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:02.000
 of adversarial changes

2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:04.000
 fragile lower bounds

2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:06.000
 leave open the possibility of algorithms that

2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:08.000
 might still perform well in practice

2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:10.000
 that's a

2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:12.000
 in the sense of the impossible and the bounds

2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000
 discussion presents the

2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:16.000
 interesting question I just like the

2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.000
 idea of robust and fragile bounds

2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000
 but

2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:22.000
 what do you make about this kind

2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.000
 of tension between

2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000
 what's provably like

2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000
 what bounds you can prove

2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:30.000
 that are like robust

2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.000
 and something that's a bit more fragile

2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:34.000
 and also

2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.000
 by way of answering that

2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:38.000
 for this particular paper

2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000
 can you say what the hell are dynamic networks

2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.000
 what are distributed outcomes

2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:44.000
 you don't know this come on now

2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:46.000
 and I have no idea and what is smooth analysis

2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:48.000
 yeah well okay so

2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:50.000
 smooth analysis it's so wasn't my idea

2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000
 so Spielman and Tang came up

2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000
 with this in the context of sequential

2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:56.000
 algorithms just like

2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:58.000
 the normal world of an algorithm that runs on a computer

2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000
 and they were looking at

2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.000
 there's a well known algorithm called the simplex

2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000
 algorithm but basically you're trying to

2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000
 whatever find a

2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:08.000
 whole around a group of points and there's an algorithm

2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.000
 that worked really well in practice

2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:12.000
 but when you analyze it you would say

2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:14.000
 you know I can't guarantee it's going to work well in practice

2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:16.000
 because you have just the right

2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:18.000
 inputs this thing could run really long

2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:20.000
 right but in practice it seemed to be really fast

2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000
 so smooth analysis as they came

2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.000
 in and they said let's assume that

2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.000
 a bad guy chooses the inputs

2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:28.000
 it could be anything like really bad ones

2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.000
 and all we're going to do because in simplex

2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.000
 their numbers we're going to just randomly

2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:34.000
 put a little bit of noise on each of the

2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.000
 numbers and they said if you put a little bit of noise

2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:38.000
 on the numbers suddenly simplex algorithm

2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.000
 goes really fast

2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000
 like oh that explains this lower bound

2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:44.000
 this idea that it could sometimes run really long

2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000
 was a fragile bound because it could only

2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.000
 run a really long time if you had exactly

2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:50.000
 the worst pathological input

2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:52.000
 and then my collaborators and I brought this over to the world

2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:54.000
 the distributed algorithms

2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:56.000
 we brought them over the general lower bounds

2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:58.000
 so in the world of dynamic networks

2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:00.000
 so distributed algorithm is a bunch of algorithms

2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:02.000
 on different machines talking to each other

2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000
 trying to solve a problem and sometimes they're in a network

2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:06.000
 so you imagine them connected with

2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:08.000
 network links and a dynamic

2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:10.000
 network those can change

2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.000
 so I was talking to you but now I can't talk to you

2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.000
 anymore now I'm connected to a person over here

2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.000
 it's a really hard environment mathematically

2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:18.000
 speaking and there's a lot of really

2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:20.000
 strong lower bounds which you could imagine

2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:22.000
 if the network can change all the time

2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:24.000
 and a bad guy is doing it it's like hard

2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.000
 to do things well so there's an algorithm

2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000
 running on every single node in the network

2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:30.000
 and then you're trying to say something

2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:32.000
 of any kind that makes any kind of definitive

2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.000
 sense about the performance of that algorithm

2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:36.000
 yeah so like we're

2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:38.000
 I just submitted a new paper on this a couple weeks ago

2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:40.000
 and we were looking at a very simple problem

2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:42.000
 there's some messages in the network

2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:44.000
 we want everyone to get them

2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000
 if the network doesn't change

2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.000
 you can do this pretty well

2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:50.000
 you can pipeline them there's some algorithms that work

2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:52.000
 basic algorithms that work really well

2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:54.000
 network can change every round

2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:56.000
 there's these lower bounds that says

2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:58.000
 it takes a really long time

2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:00.000
 there's a way that like no matter what algorithm you come up with

2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.000
 there's a way that network can change in such a way

2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:04.000
 that just really slows down your progress

2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:06.000
 basically right so smooth analysis

2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:08.000
 there says yeah but that seems like a

2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:10.000
 really you know really bad luck

2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:12.000
 if your network was changing like

2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:14.000
 exactly in the right

2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:16.000
 way that you needed to screw your algorithm

2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:18.000
 so we said what if we

2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:20.000
 randomly just add or remove a couple edges

2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:22.000
 in every round so the adversaries trying to choose the worst

2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:24.000
 possible network we're just tweaking it a little bit

2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:26.000
 and in that case this is a new paper

2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.000
 I mean it's a blinded submission so maybe I shouldn't

2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:30.000
 it's not whatever

2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:32.000
 we basically showed

2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:34.000
 an anonymous friend of yours submitted a paper

2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:36.000
 anonymous friend of mine yeah

2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:38.000
 whose paper should be accepted

2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:40.000
 so that even just adding like one random edge

2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.000
 per round

2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:44.000
 and here's a cool thing about the simplest

2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:46.000
 possible solution to this problem

2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:48.000
 blows away that lower bound it does really well

2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.000
 so that's like a very fragile lower bound

2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.000
 because we're like it's almost impossible

2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:54.000
 to actually

2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:56.000
 keep things slow

2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:58.000
 I wonder how many lower bounds you can

2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:00.000
 smash open

2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.000
 with this kind of analysis and show that they're fragile

2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:04.000
 this is my interest yeah

2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:06.000
 because in distributed algorithms

2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:08.000
 there's a ton of really famous strong lower bounds

2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:10.000
 but things have to go wrong

2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.000
 really really wrong

2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:14.000
 for these lower bound arguments to work

2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:16.000
 and so I like this approach so this

2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.000
 whole notion of fragile versus robust

2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:20.000
 I was like well let's go in and just

2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:22.000
 throw a little noise in there and if it becomes solvable

2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:24.000
 then maybe that lower bound wasn't

2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:26.000
 really something we should worry about

2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:28.000
 that's kind of embarrassed that's really uncomfortable

2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:30.000
 that's really embarrassing

2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:32.000
 to a lot of people

2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:34.000
 okay this is the OCD thing with the

2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:36.000
 spaces

2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:38.000
 it feels really good when you can provenize bound

2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:40.000
 and

2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:42.000
 if you say that that bound is fragile

2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.000
 that's

2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:46.000
 that's like there's going to be a sad kid

2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.000
 that walks

2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:50.000
 like with their lunchbox back home

2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.000
 my lower bound doesn't matter

2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:54.000
 I don't think they care it's all

2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:56.000
 I don't know it feels like to me a lot of this

2:17:56.000 --> 2:17:58.000
 theory is just math machismo

2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:00.000
 whatever this was a hard bound to prove

2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:02.000
 what do you think about that

2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:04.000
 so if you show that something is fragile

2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:06.000
 that's more important that's really important

2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:08.000
 in practice

2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:10.000
 so do you think kind of theoretical

2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:12.000
 computer science is living its own world

2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:14.000
 just like mathematics and their main

2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:16.000
 effort which I think is very valuable

2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:18.000
 is to develop ideas it's not necessarily

2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:20.000
 interesting whether it's applicable

2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:22.000
 in the real world we don't care about the applicability

2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:24.000
 we kind of do but not really

2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:26.000
 we're terrible with computers

2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:28.000
 we can't do anything useful with computers

2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:30.000
 we don't know how to code and

2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:32.000
 we're not productive members

2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:34.000
 of technological society but

2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:36.000
 I do think things percolate

2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:38.000
 you percolate from the

2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:40.000
 world of theory into the world of algorithm design

2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:42.000
 which we'll pull on the theory and now suddenly

2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:44.000
 it's useful and then the algorithm design

2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:46.000
 gets pulled into the world of practice where they say

2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:48.000
 well actually we can make this algorithm a lot better

2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:50.000
 because in practice really these servers do XYZ

2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:52.000
 and now we can make this super efficient

2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:54.000
 and so I do think, I mean I teach

2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:56.000
 theory to the PhD students at Georgetown

2:18:56.000 --> 2:18:58.000
 I show them the sort of funnel

2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:00.000
 of like okay we're over here doing theory

2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:02.000
 but eventually some of this stuff will percolate

2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:04.000
 down in effect at the very end

2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:06.000
 you know a phone but it's a long

2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:08.000
 it's a long tunnel

2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:10.000
 but the very question you're asking

2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:12.000
 at the highest philosophical level is fascinating

2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:14.000
 like if you take a system

2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:16.000
 a distributed system or a network

2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:18.000
 and introduce a little bit of noise

2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:20.000
 into it like how many

2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:22.000
 problems of that nature

2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:24.000
 are fundamentally

2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:26.000
 changed by that little introduction

2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:28.000
 of noise? Yeah

2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.000
 because it's all especially distributed algorithms

2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:32.000
 the model is everything

2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:34.000
 the way we work is we're incredibly precise

2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:36.000
 about here's exactly, it's mathematical

2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.000
 here's exactly how the network works

2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:40.000
 and it's a state machine, algorithms are state

2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:42.000
 machines, there's rounds and schedulers

2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:44.000
 we're super precise so we can prove lower bounds

2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:46.000
 but yeah often there's lower, those impossibility results

2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:48.000
 really get at the hard

2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.000
 edges of exactly how that model

2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:52.000
 works so we'll see if this

2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:54.000
 we publish the paper on this, that paper you

2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:56.000
 mentioned

2:19:56.000 --> 2:19:58.000
 they kind of introduced the idea to the distributed algorithms

2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:00.000
 and I think that's got

2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:02.000
 some traction and there's been some follow up

2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:04.000
 so we've just submitted our

2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:06.000
 our next, honestly

2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:08.000
 the issue with the next is that like the result fell out

2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:10.000
 so easily and this shows the mathematical

2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:12.000
 machismo problem in these fields

2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:14.000
 is there's a good chance

2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:16.000
 the paper won't be accepted because there wasn't

2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:18.000
 enough mathematical self

2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:20.000
 modulation. That's such a nice finding

2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:22.000
 so even just showing that very

2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:24.000
 few, just very little bit of noise

2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:26.000
 can have a dramatic

2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:28.000
 make a dramatic statement about

2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:30.000
 it was a big surprise to us but

2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:32.000
 once we figured out how to show it

2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:34.000
 it's not too hard

2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:36.000
 and these are venues

2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:38.000
 for theoretical

2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:40.000
 okay so

2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:42.000
 the fascinating tension there exists in other disciplines

2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:44.000
 like one of them is machine learning

2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:46.000
 which

2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:48.000
 despite the power

2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:50.000
 of machine learning and deep learning and all

2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:52.000
 like the impact of it

2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:54.000
 in the real world

2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:56.000
 the main conferences on machine learning

2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:58.000
 are still resistant to application papers

2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:00.000
 I'm not

2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:02.000
 sort of

2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:04.000
 and application papers broadly defined

2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:06.000
 meaning like

2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:08.000
 finding almost like you would

2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:10.000
 like Darwin did by like

2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:12.000
 going around

2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:14.000
 collecting some information

2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.000
 saying huh isn't this interesting

2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:18.000
 like those are some of the most popular blogs

2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:20.000
 and yet as a paper

2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:22.000
 it's not really accepted. I wonder

2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:24.000
 what you think about this whole world of deep

2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:26.000
 learning

2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.000
 from a perspective of theory

2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:30.000
 what do you

2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:32.000
 make of this whole discipline

2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:34.000
 of the success of neural networks of how to do

2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:36.000
 science on them. Are you excited

2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:38.000
 by the possibilities

2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:40.000
 of what we might discover about neural networks

2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:42.000
 do you think is fundamental in engineering discipline

2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:44.000
 or is there something

2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:46.000
 theoretical that we might crack open

2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.000
 one of these days and understanding

2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:50.000
 something deep about how system optimization

2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:52.000
 when how systems learn

2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:54.000
 I am convinced by

2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:56.000
 is it Tegemark and MIT who's

2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:58.000
 Tegmark? Yeah, Tegmark, right

2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:00.000
 so his notion has always been convincing to me

2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:04.000
 that the fact that some of these models are inscrutable

2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:06.000
 is not fundamental to them

2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:08.000
 and that we can we're going to get better

2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:10.000
 and better because in the end you know

2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:12.000
 the reason why practicing computer scientists

2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:14.000
 often who are doing AI

2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:16.000
 or working at AI on industry aren't like

2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:18.000
 worried about so much existential

2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:20.000
 threats is because they see the reality is

2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:22.000
 they're multiplying matrices

2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:24.000
 with NumPy or something like this, right?

2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:26.000
 And tweaking constants and hoping that the

2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:28.000
 classifier fitness for

2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.000
 God's sakes before the submission

2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:32.000
 deadline actually gets above some like it feels

2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:34.000
 like it's linear algebra

2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:36.000
 and TDM, right?

2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:38.000
 But anyways

2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:40.000
 I'm really convinced with his idea that once we understand

2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:42.000
 better and better what's going on from a theory perspective

2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:44.000
 it's going to make it into an engineering discipline

2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:46.000
 so in my mind where we're going to end up

2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:48.000
 is okay you forget

2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:50.000
 these metaphors of neurons

2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:52.000
 and these things are going to be put down

2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:54.000
 into these mathematical kind of elegant equations

2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:56.000
 differentiable equations that just

2:22:56.000 --> 2:22:58.000
 kind of work well and then it's going to be

2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:00.000
 when I need a little bit of AI in this thing

2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:02.000
 plumbing

2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:04.000
 like let's get a little bit of a

2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:06.000
 pattern recognizer with a noise module

2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:08.000
 and let's connect I mean you know this feel better than me

2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:10.000
 so I don't know if this is like a reasonable

2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:12.000
 a reasonable prediction but that we're going to

2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:14.000
 it's going to become less inscrutable

2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:16.000
 and then it's going to become more engineerable

2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:18.000
 and then we're going to have AI and more

2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:20.000
 things because we're going to have a little bit more

2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:22.000
 control over how we

2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:24.000
 piece together these different classification

2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:26.000
 black boxes.

2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:28.000
 So one of the problems and there might be

2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:30.000
 some interesting parallels that you might provide

2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:32.000
 intuition on is you know neural networks are very

2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.000
 large and they have a lot of

2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:36.000
 it you know we were talking about

2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:38.000
 you know

2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:40.000
 dynamic networks and distributed

2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.000
 algorithms

2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.000
 and one of the problems with the analysis of

2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:46.000
 neural networks

2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:48.000
 is you know you have a lot of nodes

2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:50.000
 and you have a lot of edges

2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:52.000
 to be able to interpret

2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:54.000
 and to control different things is very difficult

2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:56.000
 there's

2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:58.000
 fields and trying to figure out

2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:00.000
 like mathematically how you form

2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:02.000
 clean

2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:04.000
 representations that are like

2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:06.000
 like one node contains

2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.000
 all the information about

2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:10.000
 a particular thing and no other nodes

2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:12.000
 are correlated to it so like

2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:14.000
 it has unique knowledge

2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:16.000
 but that ultimately boils down to trying

2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:18.000
 to simplify this thing

2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:20.000
 into that goes against this very

2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.000
 nature which is like

2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:24.000
 deeply connected

2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000
 and like dynamic

2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:28.000
 and just you know

2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:30.000
 hundreds of millions billions of nodes

2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:32.000
 and in a distributed sense

2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:34.000
 like when you zoom out

2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:36.000
 the thing has a representation

2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:38.000
 of understanding of something but the individual

2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:40.000
 is just doing that little exchange

2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:42.000
 thing and it's the same thing

2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:44.000
 with Stephen Wolfram when you talk about

2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.000
 cellular automata it's very difficult to do math

2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:48.000
 when you have a huge collection

2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:50.000
 of distributed things each acting on their own

2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:52.000
 and it's almost like

2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.000
 it feels like it's

2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:56.000
 almost impossible to do any kind of

2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:58.000
 theoretical work in the traditional sense

2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:00.000
 it almost becomes completely

2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:02.000
 like

2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:04.000
 you become a biologist as

2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:06.000
 opposed to a theoretician

2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:08.000
 you just study it experimentally

2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:10.000
 I think that's the big question I guess

2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:12.000
 right?

2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000
 Is the large size

2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000
 and interconnectedness of the

2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.000
 deep learning network

2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:20.000
 fundamental to that task or we just not very good

2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:22.000
 at it yet because we're using the wrong

2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:24.000
 metaphor

2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.000
 I mean the human brain learns with much

2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:28.000
 fewer examples and

2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000
 with much less tuning of the

2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.000
 whatever whatever whatever probably that requires

2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.000
 to get those deep mind networks up and running

2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:36.000
 but yeah so I don't really know

2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:38.000
 but the one thing I have observed is that

2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000
 there's a

2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.000
 the mundane nature of some of the working with

2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000
 these models

2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000
 tends to lead people to think that

2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:48.000
 to do it like

2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.000
 it could be Skynet or it could be

2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:52.000
 like a lot of pain to get

2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000
 the thermostat to do what we wanted to do

2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:56.000
 and there's a lot of open questions in between there

2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000
 and then of course

2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:00.000
 the

2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:02.000
 distributed network

2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:04.000
 of humans

2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.000
 that use these systems so like you can have

2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:08.000
 the system itself

2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:10.000
 the neural network but you can also have

2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.000
 little algorithms controlling the behavior of humans

2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:14.000
 which is what you have with social networks

2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:16.000
 it's possible that a very

2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.000
 what is it a toaster or whatever

2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000
 the opposite of Skynet

2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:22.000
 when taking a scale well used by individual humans

2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:24.000
 and controlling their behavior can actually have

2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.000
 the Skynet effect

2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.000
 so the scale there

2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:30.000
 we might have that now

2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:32.000
 but we just don't know

2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:34.000
 is Twitter creating a little mini Skynet

2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:36.000
 because what happens it twirls out

2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000
 ramifications in the world

2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000
 and is it really that much different

2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.000
 if it's a robot with tentacles

2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:44.000
 or a bunch of servers

2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:46.000
 and the destructive effects

2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000
 could be

2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.000
 it could be political but

2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:52.000
 it could also be like

2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:54.000
 you could probably make an interesting case that

2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:56.000
 the coronavirus

2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.000
 spread on Twitter too

2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000
 in the minds of people

2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000
 like the fear

2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000
 and the misinformation in some very interesting ways

2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:06.000
 mixed up

2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.000
 and maybe this pandemic wasn't sufficiently

2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000
 dangerous to where that could have created a weird

2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000
 like

2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000
 instability but maybe other things might

2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000
 create instability like somebody

2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:18.000
 God forbid detonates nuclear weapons

2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:20.000
 so where and then maybe the

2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:22.000
 destructive aspect of that would not

2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:24.000
 as much be the military actions

2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:26.000
 but the way those news

2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:28.000
 are spread on Twitter

2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:30.000
 and the panic that creates

2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:32.000
 I think that's a great case study

2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:34.000
 what happened

2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:36.000
 I'm not suggesting that you

2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000
 let off a nuclear bomb I meant the coronavirus

2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:40.000
 but yeah

2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:42.000
 I think that's a really interesting case study

2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:44.000
 I'm interested in the counterfactual

2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.000
 of 1995

2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000
 do the same virus in 1995

2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:50.000
 so first of all it would have been

2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:52.000
 I get to hear whatever

2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:54.000
 the nightly news

2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:56.000
 about it and then they'll be my local

2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:58.000
 health board will talk about it

2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:00.000
 that mitigation decisions would

2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:02.000
 probably necessarily be

2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:04.000
 very sort of localized

2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:06.000
 like our community is trying to figure out what are we going to do

2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:08.000
 what's going to happen like we see this with schools

2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:10.000
 like where I grew up in New Jersey

2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:12.000
 there's very localized school districts

2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.000
 so even though they

2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:16.000
 had sort of really bad viral numbers

2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:18.000
 there my school I grew up in has been open since the fall

2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:20.000
 because it's very localized

2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.000
 it's like these teachers and these parents what do we want

2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:24.000
 to do what are we comfortable with

2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:26.000
 I live in a school district right now in Montgomery County

2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:28.000
 that's a billion dollar a year budget

2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:30.000
 150,000 kid school district

2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:32.000
 it just can't, it's closed

2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:34.000
 so I'm interested in that counterfactual

2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:36.000
 yes you have all this information moving around

2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:38.000
 and then you have the

2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:40.000
 the effects on discourse that we were talking about earlier

2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:42.000
 that the Neil Postman

2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:44.000
 style effects of Twitter which shifts

2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:46.000
 people into a sort of a dunk culture mindset

2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:48.000
 of don't give

2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:50.000
 an inch to the other team

2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:52.000
 we're used to this and was fired up by politics

2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:54.000
 and the unique attributes of Twitter

2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:56.000
 now throw in the coronavirus and suddenly we see

2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:58.000
 decades of public health

2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:00.000
 knowledge a lot of which was honed during the HIV

2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:02.000
 epidemic was thrown out the window

2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:04.000
 because a lot of this was happening on Twitter

2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:06.000
 and suddenly we had public health officials

2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:08.000
 using a don't give an inch to the other team

2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:10.000
 mindset of like well if we say this

2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:12.000
 that might validate something that was wrong

2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:14.000
 over here and we need to if we say this

2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:16.000
 and maybe like that'll stop them from doing this

2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:18.000
 that's like very Twittery

2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:20.000
 in a way that in 1995 is probably

2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:22.000
 not the way

2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:24.000
 public health officials would be thinking

2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:26.000
 or now it's like well this is if we said this

2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:28.000
 about masks but the other team said that about

2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:30.000
 masks we can't give an inch so we got to be

2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:32.000
 careful and like we can't tell people it's okay

2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:34.000
 after they're vaccinated because that might

2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:36.000
 we're giving them an inch on this and that's very

2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:38.000
 Twittery in my mind right that is the impact

2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:40.000
 of Twitter on the way

2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:42.000
 we think about discourse which is a dunking culture

2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:44.000
 of don't give any inch to the other team and it's all about

2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:46.000
 slam dunks we are completely right and they're completely wrong

2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:48.000
 it's as a rhetorical strategy is incredibly

2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:50.000
 simplistic but it's also the way that we

2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:52.000
 think right now about how we do debate

2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:54.000
 it combined terribly

2:29:54.000 --> 2:29:56.000
 with an election year pandemic

2:29:56.000 --> 2:29:58.000
 yeah an election year pandemic

2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:00.000
 I wonder if we could do some smooth analysis

2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:02.000
 let's run the simulation over a few times

2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:04.000
 a little bit noise yeah see if

2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:06.000
 it can dramatically change the behavior of the system

2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:08.000
 yeah okay we talked about

2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:10.000
 your love for proving that

2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:12.000
 something is impossible so there's

2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:14.000
 quite a few still open problems

2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:16.000
 and complexity

2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:18.000
 of algorithms so let me ask

2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:20.000
 does P equal NP

2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:22.000
 probably not

2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:24.000
 probably not if

2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:26.000
 P equals NP

2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:28.000
 what kind of

2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:30.000
 you know and you'll be really surprised

2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:32.000
 somebody proves it yeah

2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:34.000
 what would that proof look like

2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:36.000
 and why would that even be what would that mean

2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:38.000
 what would that proof look like

2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:40.000
 in what possible universe could P equals NP

2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:42.000
 is there something insightful you can say there

2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:44.000
 it could

2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:46.000
 it could be true

2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:48.000
 I mean I'm not a complexity theorist but every

2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:50.000
 complexity theorist I know

2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:52.000
 is convinced they're not equal

2:30:52.000 --> 2:30:54.000
 and are basically not working on anymore

2:30:54.000 --> 2:30:56.000
 I mean there is a million dollars at stake if you can

2:30:56.000 --> 2:30:58.000
 solve the proof it's one of the millennium prizes

2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:00.000
 okay so here's how I think

2:31:00.000 --> 2:31:02.000
 the P not equals NP proof is going to eventually

2:31:02.000 --> 2:31:04.000
 happen I think it's going to fall out

2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:06.000
 and it's going to be

2:31:06.000 --> 2:31:08.000
 not super simple

2:31:08.000 --> 2:31:10.000
 but not as hard as people think because

2:31:10.000 --> 2:31:12.000
 my theory about a lot of theoretical computer science

2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:14.000
 based on just some results I've done

2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:16.000
 so this is a huge extrapolation is that

2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:18.000
 a lot of what we're doing is just obfuscating

2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:20.000
 deeper mathematics

2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:22.000
 so like this happens to me a lot

2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:24.000
 not a lot but it's happened to me a few times in my work

2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:26.000
 where we obfuscate it because

2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:28.000
 we say well there's an algorithm and it has this much

2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:30.000
 you know memory and they're connected on a network

2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:32.000
 and okay here's our setup and now we're

2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:34.000
 trying to see how fast it can solve a problem

2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:36.000
 and people do bounds about it

2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:38.000
 and then the end it turns out that like we were just obfuscating

2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:40.000
 some underlying

2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:42.000
 you know mathematical thing that already

2:31:42.000 --> 2:31:44.000
 existed right so this has happened

2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:46.000
 to me I had this paper I was quite fond

2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:48.000
 of a while ago it was looking at this

2:31:48.000 --> 2:31:50.000
 problem called contention resolution

2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:52.000
 where you you you put

2:31:52.000 --> 2:31:54.000
 an unknown set of people on a shared channel

2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:56.000
 and they're trying to break symmetry so

2:31:56.000 --> 2:31:58.000
 it's like an ethernet whatever only one person

2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:00.000
 can use it at a time you try to break symmetry there's all these

2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:02.000
 bounds people have proven over the years

2:32:02.000 --> 2:32:04.000
 about how long it takes to do this right

2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:06.000
 and like I discovered

2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:08.000
 at some point there's this one

2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:10.000
 combinatorial result

2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:12.000
 from the early 1990s

2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:14.000
 all of these lower bound proofs all

2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:16.000
 come from this and in fact it improved

2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:18.000
 a lot of them and simplified a lot you could put it all

2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.000
 in one paper you know it's like are we

2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:22.000
 really and then okay so this new paper that

2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:24.000
 I submitted a couple weeks ago

2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:26.000
 I found you could take some of these same lower bound

2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:28.000
 proofs for this contention resolution problem

2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:30.000
 you could re prove them using

2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:32.000
 Shannon source code theorem

2:32:32.000 --> 2:32:34.000
 that actually when you're breaking contention

2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:36.000
 what you're really doing is building

2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:38.000
 a code over

2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:40.000
 if you have a distribution on the network

2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:42.000
 sizes is a code over that source

2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:44.000
 and if you plug in a high entropy

2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:46.000
 information source and plug in from 1948

2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:48.000
 the source code theorem that says on

2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:50.000
 a noiseless channel you can't send things

2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:52.000
 at a faster rate than the entropy allows

2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:54.000
 the exact same lower bounds fall back out again

2:32:54.000 --> 2:32:56.000
 right so like this type of thing happens

2:32:56.000 --> 2:32:58.000
 there's some famous lower bounds and distributed

2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:00.000
 algorithms that turned out to all be

2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:02.000
 algebraic topology underneath the covers

2:33:02.000 --> 2:33:04.000
 and they won the girdle prize for

2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:06.000
 working on that so my sense

2:33:06.000 --> 2:33:08.000
 is what's going to happen is at some point

2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:10.000
 someone really smart to be

2:33:10.000 --> 2:33:12.000
 very exciting is going to realize there's

2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:14.000
 some sort of other representation

2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:16.000
 of what's going on with these

2:33:16.000 --> 2:33:18.000
 Turing machines trying to sort of efficiently

2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:20.000
 actually fall out of that and there'll be

2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:22.000
 an existing mathematical result

2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:24.000
 that applies someone

2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:26.000
 or something I guess it could be

2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:28.000
 AI theorem provers kind of thing it

2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:30.000
 could be yeah I mean not a well

2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:32.000
 I mean there's theorem provers like what

2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:34.000
 that means now which is

2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:36.000
 not fun it's just a bunch

2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:38.000
 of very carefully formulated

2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:40.000
 postulates that but

2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:42.000
 I take your point yeah yeah so

2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:44.000
 okay

2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:46.000
 you know on a small tangent and then

2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:48.000
 then you're kind of implying the

2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:50.000
 mathematics it almost feels like a

2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:52.000
 kind of weird evolutionary

2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:54.000
 tree that ultimately leads back to some kind

2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:56.000
 of ancestral few fundamental

2:33:56.000 --> 2:33:58.000
 ideas that all they're just like

2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:00.000
 they're all somehow connected

2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:02.000
 in that sense

2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:04.000
 do you think

2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:06.000
 math is fundamental

2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:08.000
 to our universe and we're just like slowly

2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:10.000
 trying to understand

2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:12.000
 these patterns or

2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:14.000
 is it discovered

2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.000
 or is it just a

2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:18.000
 little game that we play

2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:20.000
 amongst ourselves to try to

2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:22.000
 fit little patterns to the world

2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:24.000
 yeah that's the question

2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:26.000
 right that's the physicist question

2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:28.000
 I mean I'm probably I'm in the discovered

2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:30.000
 camp but I don't do theoretical

2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:32.000
 physics so I know they have

2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:34.000
 a they feel

2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:36.000
 like they have a stronger claim to answering that question

2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:38.000
 but everything comes back

2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:40.000
 to it everything comes back to it I mean all the physics

2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:42.000
 the fact that the universe

2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:44.000
 is well okay

2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:46.000
 it's a complicated

2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:48.000
 question so how often

2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:50.000
 do you think how

2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:52.000
 deeply does this result

2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:54.000
 describe the fundamental

2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:56.000
 reality of nature

2:34:56.000 --> 2:34:58.000
 so the

2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:00.000
 the reason I hesitated because it's

2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:02.000
 something I taught this seminar and did a little

2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:04.000
 work on what are called biological

2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:06.000
 algorithms so there's this

2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:08.000
 notion of

2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:10.000
 so

2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:12.000
 physicists use mathematics

2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:14.000
 to explain the universe

2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:16.000
 right and it was unreasonable that

2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:18.000
 mathematics work so well

2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:20.000
 you know all these differential equations

2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:22.000
 why does that explain all we need to know about

2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:24.000
 dynamics and gravity and all these type of things

2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:26.000
 well there's this movement within

2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:28.000
 the intersection of computer science and biology

2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:30.000
 it's kind of wolframmium I guess

2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:32.000
 really that

2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:34.000
 algorithms can be very

2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:36.000
 explanatory right that like if you're trying to

2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:38.000
 explain

2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:40.000
 parsimoniously something about

2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:42.000
 like an ant colony or something like this you're not

2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:44.000
 going to ultimately it's not going to be

2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:46.000
 explained as a equation like a

2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:48.000
 physics equation it's going to be explained by an algorithm

2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.000
 so like this algorithm

2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:52.000
 run distributedly

2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:54.000
 is going to explain the behavior so

2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:56.000
 that's mathematical but not quite mathematical

2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:58.000
 but it is if you think about an algorithm like a

2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:00.000
 lambda calculus which brings you back to the

2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:02.000
 world of mathematics I'm thinking out loud here but

2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:04.000
 basically

2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:06.000
 abstract math

2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:08.000
 is sort of like unreasonably effective

2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:10.000
 at explaining a lot

2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:12.000
 of things and that's just what I feel like I glimpse I'm not

2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:14.000
 a

2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000
 not like a super well known theoretician I don't have really famous

2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:18.000
 results so even as a

2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:20.000
 sort of middling

2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:22.000
 you know career theoretician I

2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:24.000
 keep encountering this

2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:26.000
 where we think we're solving some

2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:28.000
 problem about computers and algorithms

2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:30.000
 and it's some much deeper

2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:32.000
 underlying math it's Shannon

2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:34.000
 but Shannon is entropy but entropy was

2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:36.000
 really you know

2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:38.000
 goes all the way back to

2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:40.000
 whatever it was boiler all the way back to looking at the early

2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:42.000
 physics and and

2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:44.000
 it's anyways to me I think it's

2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:46.000
 amazing yeah

2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:48.000
 but it could be the flip side of that could be just

2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:50.000
 our brains draw so much pleasure from

2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:52.000
 the deriving generalized

2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:54.000
 theories and simplifying

2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.000
 the universe that would just naturally

2:36:56.000 --> 2:36:58.000
 see that kind of simplicity and everything

2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:00.000
 yeah so that's the whole

2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000
 you know Newton to Einstein right so

2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:04.000
 you can you can say this must be right because it's

2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:06.000
 so predictive well it's not quite

2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:08.000
 predictive because Mercury wobbles a little bit but I think

2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:10.000
 we have it set and then you turn out

2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:12.000
 no Einstein and then and then you get

2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:14.000
 more like no not Einstein

2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:16.000
 actually statistical and yeah so

2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:18.000
 it's hard to also know like where

2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:20.000
 smooth analysis fits into all that

2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:22.000
 or a little bit of no like you can

2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:24.000
 say something very clean

2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:26.000
 about a system and then

2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:28.000
 a little bit of noise like the average

2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:30.000
 case is actually very different and so

2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:32.000
 yeah I mean that's where like the quantum

2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:34.000
 mechanics comes in it's like

2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:36.000
 why does it have to be randomness in this

2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.000
 yeah I would have to do this complex statistics

2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:40.000
 yeah yeah

2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:42.000
 so to be determined

2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:44.000
 yeah that'd be my next book that'd be ambitious

2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:46.000
 the fundamental

2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:48.000
 the fundamental core

2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:50.000
 of reality comma and some advice

2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:52.000
 for being more productive at work

2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:54.000
 can I ask you just

2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:56.000
 if it's possible to do an overview

2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:58.000
 and just some brief

2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:00.000
 comments of wisdom

2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:02.000
 on the process of publishing a book

2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:04.000
 what's that process until what are the

2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:06.000
 different options and what's your

2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:08.000
 recommendation

2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:10.000
 for somebody that wants

2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.000
 to write a book like yours

2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:14.000
 a nonfiction book that discovers

2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:16.000
 something interesting

2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:18.000
 about this world

2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:20.000
 so what I usually advise

2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:22.000
 is follow

2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:24.000
 the process as is

2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:26.000
 don't try to reinvent

2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.000
 I think that happens

2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:30.000
 a lot where

2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:32.000
 you'll try to reinvent the way the publishing

2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:34.000
 industry should work like this is kind of

2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:36.000
 not like in a business model

2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:38.000
 ways but just like this is what I want to do

2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:40.000
 I want to write a thousand words a day

2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:42.000
 and I want to do this and I'm going to put it on the internet

2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:44.000
 and the publishing industry is very

2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:46.000
 specific about how it works

2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:48.000
 and so like when I got started writing books

2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:50.000
 which was at a very young age so you know

2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:52.000
 I sold my first book at the age of 21

2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:54.000
 the way I did that

2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:56.000
 is I found the family friend

2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:58.000
 that was an agent

2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:00.000
 and I said I'm not trying to make you be my

2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:02.000
 agent just explain to me how this works

2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:04.000
 not just how the world works but give me

2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:06.000
 the hard truth about how would a

2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:08.000
 21 year old under what conditions could a

2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:10.000
 21 year old sell a book and what would that look like

2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:12.000
 and she just explained it to me well you have to do this

2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:14.000
 and have to be a subject that it made sense for you to write

2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:16.000
 and you would have to do this type of writing for the publications

2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:18.000
 the validated and blah blah blah

2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:20.000
 and you have to get the agent first and I learned a whole game plan

2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.000
 and then I executed

2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:24.000
 and so the rough game plan is with

2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:26.000
 nonfiction you get the agent first

2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:28.000
 and the agent is going to sell it to the publishers

2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:30.000
 so like you're never sending something directly

2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:32.000
 to the publishers and nonfiction you're not

2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000
 writing the book first

2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:36.000
 you're going to get an advance from the publisher once sold

2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:38.000
 and then you're going to

2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:40.000
 do the primary writing of the book

2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:42.000
 in fact it will in most circumstances

2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:44.000
 hurt you if you've already written

2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:46.000
 so you're trying to sell

2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:48.000
 well I guess the agent first you sell it to the agent

2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:50.000
 and the agent sells it to the publishers

2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.000
 it's much easier to get an agent than a book deal

2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:54.000
 so the thought is if you can't get an

2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:56.000
 agent then why would you so you start with

2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:58.000
 and also in the way this works with a good

2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:00.000
 agent is they know all the editors

2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:02.000
 and they have lunch with the editors and they're always just

2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:04.000
 okay what projects you have coming what are you looking for

2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:06.000
 here's one of my authors that's the way all these deals happen

2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:08.000
 it's not you're not emailing a manuscript to

2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:10.000
 a slush pile

2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:12.000
 yeah and so first of all the agent takes a percentage

2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:14.000
 and then the publishers this is where the process

2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:16.000
 comes in they take also a cut

2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:18.000
 that's probably ridiculous

2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:20.000
 so if you try to reinvent

2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:22.000
 the system you'll probably be frustrated

2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:24.000
 by the percentage that everyone takes relative

2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:26.000
 to how much bureaucracy and efficiency

2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:28.000
 ridiculousness there is in the system

2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:30.000
 your recommendation is like

2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:32.000
 you're just one ant

2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:34.000
 stop trying to build your own ant colony

2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:36.000
 well or if you

2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:38.000
 create your own process for how it should work

2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:40.000
 the book's not going to get published

2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:42.000
 so there's the separate question the economic question

2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:44.000
 like should I create my own

2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:46.000
 self publish it or do something like that

2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:48.000
 but putting that aside there's a lot of people

2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:50.000
 I encounter that want to publish a book

2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:52.000
 with a main publisher but they invent

2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:54.000
 their own rules for how that works

2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:56.000
 so then the alternative though is

2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000
 self publishing and the downside

2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:00.000
 there's a lot of downsides

2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:02.000
 it's like it's almost like

2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:04.000
 publishing an opinion piece in the New York Times

2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:06.000
 versus writing our blog

2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.000
 there's no reason why

2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:10.000
 writing a blog post on Medium

2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:12.000
 can't get way more attention

2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:14.000
 and legitimacy

2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:16.000
 and long lasting prestige

2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:18.000
 than in New York Times article

2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:20.000
 but nevertheless for most people

2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:22.000
 writing in a prestigious newspaper

2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:24.000
 quote unquote prestigious

2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:26.000
 is just easier

2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:28.000
 and well and depends

2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:30.000
 on your goal so you know like

2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:32.000
 I push you towards a big publisher

2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:34.000
 because I think your goal

2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:36.000
 it's huge ideas you want impact

2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:38.000
 you're going to have more impact

2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:40.000
 even though like actually

2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:42.000
 so there's different ways to measure impact

2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:44.000
 in the world of ideas

2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:46.000
 and also yeah in the world of ideas

2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:48.000
 it's kind of like the clubhouse thing

2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000
 now even if the audience is not large

2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:52.000
 the people in the audience

2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:54.000
 are very interesting

2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:56.000
 it's like the conversation

2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:58.000
 feels like it has long lasting

2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:00.000
 impact

2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:02.000
 among the people who

2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:04.000
 in different and disparate industries

2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:06.000
 that are also then starting

2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.000
 normal conversations and all that kind of stuff

2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:10.000
 yeah because you have other

2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:12.000
 like self publishing a book

2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:14.000
 the goals that would solve

2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:16.000
 you have much better ways of getting to those goals

2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:18.000
 might be part of it right so if there's the financial aspect

2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:20.000
 of well you get to keep more of it

2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:22.000
 I mean the podcast is probably going to crush

2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:24.000
 what the book is going to do anyways right yeah

2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.000
 if it's

2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:28.000
 get directly to certain audiences

2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:30.000
 or crowds it might be harder through a traditional publisher

2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:32.000
 there's better ways to talk to those crowds

2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:34.000
 it could be on clubhouse with all these new technologies

2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:36.000
 self published books not going to be the most effective way

2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:38.000
 to find your way to a new crowd

2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:40.000
 but if the idea is like I want to have a

2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:42.000
 leave a dent

2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:44.000
 in the world of ideas

2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:46.000
 then they have a vulnerable old publisher

2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.000
 you know put out your book

2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:50.000
 in a nice hardcover and do the things

2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:52.000
 they do

2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:54.000
 that goes a long way and they do do a lot

2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:56.000
 it's very difficult actually

2:42:56.000 --> 2:42:58.000
 they're so much involved in playing together a book

2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:00.000
 they get books into bookstores and all that kind of stuff

2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:02.000
 all that stuff and from an efficiency standpoint

2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:04.000
 I mean just a time involved in trying to do this

2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:06.000
 yourself is

2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:08.000
 they have a process right like you said

2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:10.000
 they have a process I mean I know

2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:12.000
 like Jaco did this recently he started his own imprint

2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:14.000
 and I have a couple other but it's a huge

2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:16.000
 overhead I mean if you like

2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:18.000
 if you run a business and you

2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:20.000
 Jaco is a good case study right so he got

2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:22.000
 you know fed up with Simon and Schuster

2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:24.000
 dragging their feet and said I'm going to start

2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:26.000
 my own imprint then if you're not going to publish

2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:28.000
 my kids book

2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000
 but he what does he do he runs businesses

2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:32.000
 right yeah so I think in his world

2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:34.000
 I already run I'm a partner

2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:36.000
 in whatever an origin and I have this and that and so it's like

2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:38.000
 yeah we can run businesses that's what we know

2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:40.000
 how to do that's what I do I run businesses

2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:42.000
 I have people but for like you or I

2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:44.000
 we don't run businesses it'd be terrible

2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:46.000
 yeah yeah well especially

2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:48.000
 kinds of businesses right so I do

2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:50.000
 want to launch a business but very different technology

2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:52.000
 business very different very different

2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:54.000
 very different yeah yeah I mean this is

2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:56.000
 like okay and you copy editors and

2:43:56.000 --> 2:43:58.000
 graphic book binders and I need

2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:00.000
 to contract with the printer but the printer doesn't

2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:02.000
 have slots and so now I have to try to you I mean it's

2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:04.000
 I get so

2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:06.000
 I need to shut this off my brain but I get so

2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:08.000
 frustrated when the system could clearly be improved

2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:10.000
 it's the thing that you're mentioning

2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:12.000
 yeah it's like this is so inefficient

2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:14.000
 every time I go to the DMV or something like

2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:16.000
 that you think like

2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:18.000
 this could be done so much better

2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:20.000
 yeah but you know

2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:22.000
 and the same thing is

2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:24.000
 the worry with an editor

2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:26.000
 which I guess would come from the publisher

2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:28.000
 like who would

2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:30.000
 how much

2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:32.000
 supervision on your book did you receive like

2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:34.000
 hey do you think this is too long

2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:36.000
 or do you think the title

2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:38.000
 how much choice do you have in the title

2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:40.000
 in the cover in the presentation

2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:42.000
 in the branding and all that kind of stuff

2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:44.000
 yeah I mean all of it depends right so

2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:46.000
 when it comes on

2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:48.000
 the relationship with the editor

2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:50.000
 on the writing it depends on the editor and it depends

2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:52.000
 on you

2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:54.000
 it's like at this point I'm on my seventh book

2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:56.000
 and I write for a lot of major

2:44:56.000 --> 2:44:58.000
 publications and at this point I have

2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:00.000
 what I feel like is a

2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:02.000
 voice and a level of craft

2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:04.000
 that I'm very comfortable with

2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:06.000
 so my editor is not going to be

2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:08.000
 she kind of is going to trust me and it's going to be more big picture

2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:10.000
 like

2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:12.000
 I've never read here or this seems like it could be

2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:14.000
 longer whereas the first book I wrote

2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:16.000
 when I was 21

2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:18.000
 I had notes such as you start a lot of sentences

2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:20.000
 with so

2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:22.000
 you don't use any contractions because I've been doing

2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:24.000
 scientific writing we don't use contractions

2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:26.000
 you should probably use contractions

2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:28.000
 that was way more you know I had to go back

2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:30.000
 and rewrite the whole thing yeah

2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:32.000
 but ultimately the recommendation

2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:34.000
 I mean we talked offline

2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000
 I was thinking loosely

2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:38.000
 not really sure but I was thinking of writing a book

2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:40.000
 and there's a kind of desire to go

2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:42.000
 self publishing not for financial reasons

2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:44.000
 and the money can be good by the way right I mean

2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:46.000
 it's very

2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:48.000
 power law type just distributed

2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:50.000
 so the money on a hardcover is somewhere between

2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:52.000
 one and two dollars a book

2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:54.000
 so the thing is I personally don't

2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:56.000
 but you give up 15% of the agent so

2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:58.000
 I personally don't care about money as I've

2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:00.000
 mentioned before but I for some reason

2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:02.000
 really don't like spending money

2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:04.000
 on things

2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:06.000
 that are not worth it

2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:08.000
 I don't care if I get money

2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.000
 I just don't like spending money on

2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:12.000
 like feeding a system that's

2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.000
 inefficient it's like I'm contributing to the

2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:16.000
 problem that's my biggest problem

2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:18.000
 right so you think that you're worried about the

2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:20.000
 inefficiencies of the

2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:22.000
 yeah the fact that

2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:24.000
 the number of people involved or the overhead

2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:26.000
 the emails again

2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:28.000
 the fact that

2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:30.000
 they have this way of speaking

2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:32.000
 which I'm allergic to many people

2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:34.000
 like that's very marketing speak

2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:36.000
 like you could tell they've been having

2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:38.000
 zoom meetings all day

2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.000
 it's like as opposed to

2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:42.000
 a sort of creative

2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:44.000
 collaborators that are like

2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:46.000
 also a little bit crazy

2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:48.000
 and I suppose some of that is finding the right people

2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:50.000
 finding the right people that's what I would say I say

2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:52.000
 there's definitely and maybe it's just good fortune

2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:54.000
 good fortune

2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:56.000
 in terms of like my agents and editors I've worked with

2:46:56.000 --> 2:46:58.000
 there's really good people

2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:00.000
 who

2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:02.000
 see the vision or smart or incredibly

2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:04.000
 literary they yeah

2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:06.000
 psychologically yeah I had a great editor

2:47:06.000 --> 2:47:08.000
 when I was first moving into hard cover books for example

2:47:08.000 --> 2:47:10.000
 is my first you know

2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:12.000
 big book advance

2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:14.000
 and my first sort of big

2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:16.000
 deal and it was like a senior

2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:18.000
 editor and it was

2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:20.000
 very useful you know it was like we had

2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:22.000
 a lot of long talks right I was

2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:24.000
 this was my fourth book so good they can't ignore you was

2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:26.000
 my first big hard cover idea

2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:28.000
 book

2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:30.000
 and we had a lot of talks like even before I started

2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:32.000
 writing it just let's

2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:34.000
 talk about books and his philosophy

2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:36.000
 had been in the business for a long time he was the head

2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:38.000
 of the the head of the imprint it was useful

2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:40.000
 yeah but

2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:42.000
 I mean the other frustrating thing is how long the whole thing takes

2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:44.000
 a long time

2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.000
 yeah I suppose that's you just have to

2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:48.000
 well I yeah I handed in this manuscript

2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.000
 for the the the book that comes out

2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:52.000
 now like when this I handed it in

2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:54.000
 I mean over the summer like during the

2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:56.000
 pandemic so it's not it's not terrible

2:47:56.000 --> 2:47:58.000
 right and we were editing during the pandemic and I finished

2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:00.000
 it in the spring

2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:02.000
 we've talked most of today

2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:04.000
 except for a little bit computer science most of today

2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:06.000
 about a productive life

2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:08.000
 how does

2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:10.000
 love friendship and family

2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:12.000
 fit into that

2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:14.000
 is there

2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:16.000
 do you find that there's a tension

2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:18.000
 is it

2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:20.000
 possible for relationships to energize

2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:22.000
 the whole process to benefit

2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:24.000
 or is it ultimately

2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:26.000
 a trade off but because life

2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:28.000
 is short

2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:30.000
 and ultimately

2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:32.000
 we seek happiness not productivity

2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:34.000
 that we have to

2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000
 accept that tension

2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:38.000
 I mean I think relationships

2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:40.000
 is the

2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:42.000
 that's the whole deal

2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:44.000
 like I thought about this the other day

2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:46.000
 I don't know what the context was I was thinking about

2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:48.000
 if I was going to give like an advice speech

2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:50.000
 like a commencement address or like to give

2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:52.000
 an advice to young people

2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:54.000
 and like the big question

2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.000
 I have for young people is

2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:58.000
 if they haven't already bad things are going to happen

2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:00.000
 that you don't control

2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.000
 so what's the plan

2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:04.000
 let's start figuring that out now

2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000
 because it's not all good

2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:08.000
 some people get off better than others but eventually

2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:10.000
 stuff happens

2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:12.000
 you get sick, something falls apart

2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:14.000
 the economy craters

2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:16.000
 someone you know dies

2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.000
 all sorts of bad stuff is going to happen

2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:20.000
 so how are we going to do this

2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.000
 like how do we

2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.000
 live life and life is hard

2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:26.000
 and in ways that is unfair and unpredictable

2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:28.000
 then relationships is the

2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:30.000
 that's the buffer for all of that

2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:32.000
 because we're wired for it

2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.000
 I went down this rabbit hole with digital minimalism

2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:36.000
 I went down this huge rabbit hole about

2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:38.000
 the human brain and sociality

2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:40.000
 it's all we're wired to do

2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:42.000
 it's like all of our brain is for this

2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000
 everything, all of our mechanisms

2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.000
 everything is made to service

2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:48.000
 social connections because of what kept you alive

2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.000
 I mean you had your tribal connections

2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:52.000
 you didn't starve during the famine

2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:54.000
 people would share food etc

2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:56.000
 and so you can't neglect that

2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:58.000
 and it's like everything

2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:00.000
 and people feel it right, like there's no

2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:02.000
 our social networks are hooked up to the pain center

2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.000
 it's why it feels so terrible when you miss someone

2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:06.000
 like someone dies or something right

2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:08.000
 that's like how seriously we take it

2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:10.000
 there's a pretty accepted theory that the default

2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000
 mode network, like a lot of what the default mode network

2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.000
 is doing so the sort of the default state

2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:16.000
 our brain goes into when we're not doing something in particular

2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:18.000
 is practicing sociality

2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000
 practicing interactions

2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:22.000
 because it's so crucial to what we do

2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.000
 it's like at the core

2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:26.000
 of human thriving so I've

2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.000
 more recently the way I think about it is like relationships first

2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:30.000
 like okay

2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:32.000
 given that foundation of putting like

2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:34.000
 and I don't think we put nearly enough time into it

2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:36.000
 I worry that social media is reducing relationships

2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:38.000
 strong relationships

2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:40.000
 strong relationships where you're sacrificing non trivial

2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:42.000
 time and attention

2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:44.000
 resources whatever on behalf of other people

2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:46.000
 that's the net that is

2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:48.000
 going to allow you to get through anything

2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:50.000
 then

2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:52.000
 now what do we want to do with

2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.000
 the surplus that remains may want to build

2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000
 some build some fire build some tools

2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:58.000
 so put relationships first I like

2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:00.000
 the worst case analysis from the computer science

2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:02.000
 perspective put relationships

2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:04.000
 first yeah because everything else is just

2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:06.000
 just

2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:08.000
 assuming average case

2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:10.000
 assuming things kind of keep going as they were

2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:12.000
 going and you're neglecting the fundamental

2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:14.000
 human drive like we have

2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:16.000
 this we talked about the boredom instinct we want to build things

2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000
 we want to have impact we want to do productivity that's

2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:20.000
 not nearly as clear cut of a drive of we need

2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:22.000
 people

2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.000
 but if we look at the real worst case

2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:26.000
 analysis here is

2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:28.000
 one day

2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:30.000
 you're pretty young now but

2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:32.000
 that's not going to last very long

2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:34.000
 you're going to die one day is that something you think about

2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:36.000
 a little bit

2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:38.000
 are you afraid of death well I'm

2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:40.000
 up the mindset of let's make that a

2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:42.000
 productivity hack

2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:44.000
 one of the mindset of

2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:46.000
 we need to confront that

2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:48.000
 soon yeah so let's do

2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:50.000
 what we can now so that when we really confront

2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:52.000
 and think about it we're more likely to

2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:54.000
 feel better about it so in other words like let's

2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:56.000
 focus now on living

2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:58.000
 and doing things in such a way that we're proud

2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:00.000
 of so that when it really comes time to confront

2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:02.000
 that we're more likely

2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:04.000
 to say like okay I feel kind of good

2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:06.000
 about the situation so what

2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:08.000
 when you're laying in your death bed

2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:10.000
 would you in looking back

2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:12.000
 would make you think like oh I did

2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:14.000
 I'm okay I'm proud of that

2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:16.000
 I optimized the hell out of that

2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:18.000
 that's a good question that

2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:20.000
 go backwards on

2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:22.000
 I mean this is like David Brooks's

2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:24.000
 eulogy

2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:26.000
 virtues versus resume virtues

2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:28.000
 right so his argument is that

2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:30.000
 that's another interesting DC area

2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:32.000
 person I keep thinking of interesting DC

2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:34.000
 area people all right David Brooks is here too

2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:38.000
 his argument he thinks eulogy virtues

2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:40.000
 so what we eulogize is different than what

2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:42.000
 we promote on the resume

2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:44.000
 that's his whole thing now right

2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:46.000
 his second mountain wrote the character

2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:48.000
 both these books are he has this whole premise

2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:50.000
 of there's like this professional phase

2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:52.000
 and there's a phase of

2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:54.000
 giving of yourself and sacrificing on behalf

2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:56.000
 of other people I don't know

2:52:56.000 --> 2:52:58.000
 maybe it's all mixed together right you want to

2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:00.000
 I think living by a code is important

2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:02.000
 right I mean there's something that's not

2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:04.000
 emphasized enough I always think of advice

2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:06.000
 that my undergrad should be given that

2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:08.000
 they're not given especially at a place like Georgetown

2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:10.000
 that has this like deep history of

2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:12.000
 you know trying to promote human flourishing

2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:14.000
 because of the Jesuit connection

2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:16.000
 there's such

2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:18.000
 there's such

2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:20.000
 resiliency and pride that comes out of

2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:22.000
 living well even when it's hard

2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:24.000
 like living according to a code living according to

2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:26.000
 which which you know I think religion

2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:28.000
 used to structure this for people

2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:30.000
 and but in its absence you need some sort of

2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:32.000
 replacement but this even when things where

2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:34.000
 soldiers get this a lot right the experience

2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:36.000
 is a lot even when things were tough I was able

2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:38.000
 to persist in living this way that I knew was right

2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:40.000
 even though it wasn't the easiest thing to do in the moment

2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:42.000
 like fewer things give humans more

2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:44.000
 resiliency like having done that

2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:46.000
 your relationships were strong right many

2:53:46.000 --> 2:53:48.000
 people coming to your funeral is the standard

2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:50.000
 like a lot of people are going to come to your funeral

2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:52.000
 like I mean you matter to a lot of people

2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:54.000
 and then maybe having done to to the extent

2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:56.000
 of whatever capabilities

2:53:56.000 --> 2:53:58.000
 you are happen to be granted you know

2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:00.000
 and they're different for different people

2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:02.000
 and some people can sprint real fast and some people

2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:04.000
 try to actually do something

2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:06.000
 of impact

2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:08.000
 I'll just promise to give

2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:10.000
 gift cards to anybody who shows up to the funeral

2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:12.000
 you're going to hack it

2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:14.000
 even the funeral there's going to be a lottery

2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:16.000
 wheel you spin when you come in and someone goes away

2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:18.000
 with ten thousand dollars

2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:20.000
 see the problem is like with all this

2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:22.000
 the living by principles

2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:24.000
 living a principal life focusing on relationships

2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:26.000
 and kind of thinking

2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:28.000
 of this life as this perfect thing kind of

2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:30.000
 forgets the notion that none of it

2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:32.000
 you know

2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:34.000
 makes any sense

2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:36.000
 like the

2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:38.000
 it kind of implies

2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:40.000
 that this is like a video game

2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:42.000
 and you want to get a high score

2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:44.000
 as opposed to none of this

2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:46.000
 even makes sense

2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:48.000
 like why would he

2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:50.000
 like what that

2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:52.000
 like what does it even mean

2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:54.000
 to die it's going to be over

2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:56.000
 it's like everything I do

2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:58.000
 all these productivity hacks

2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:00.000
 all this life all these efforts all these creative efforts

2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:02.000
 kind of assume it's going to go on forever

2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:04.000
 there's a kind of sense of immortality

2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:06.000
 and I don't even know

2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:08.000
 how to intellectually make sense that it ends

2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:10.000
 of course got to ask you in that

2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:12.000
 context what do you think is the meaning

2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:14.000
 of it all especially for a computer

2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:16.000
 scientist I mean there's got to be some

2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:18.000
 mathematical

2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.000
 yeah 27 or what's the

2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:22.000
 what's the uh...

2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:24.000
 42 okay

2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:26.000
 27 is a better number

2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:28.000
 maybe you're on to something with a 27

2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:30.000
 I don't want to give away too much

2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:32.000
 but just trust me 27

2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:34.000
 it's divisible

2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:36.000
 so I mean

2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:38.000
 I don't know obviously right I mean

2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:40.000
 it's hoping what

2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:42.000
 I don't know but going back to what you were saying

2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:44.000
 about the sort of the existentialist

2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:46.000
 or sort of the more nihilist

2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:48.000
 style approach the one thing

2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:50.000
 that there is are intimations

2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:52.000
 right so that there's these

2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:54.000
 intimations that human have

2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:56.000
 somehow this feels right and this feels

2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:58.000
 wrong this feels good this feels like

2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:00.000
 I'm doing I mean aligned

2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:02.000
 with something you know when I'm acting with courage

2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:04.000
 to save whatever right it's not

2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:06.000
 these intimations are agrounding against arbitrariness

2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:08.000
 like one of the ideas I'm really

2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:10.000
 interested in is that

2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:12.000
 uh... when you look at religion

2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:14.000
 right so I'm

2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:16.000
 interested in world religions for

2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:18.000
 my grandfather was like a theologian

2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:20.000
 that studied and wrote all these books and I'm very interested

2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:22.000
 in this type of stuff and there's

2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:24.000
 this great book that's

2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:26.000
 it's not

2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:28.000
 specific to a particular religion but it's Karen

2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:30.000
 Armstrong wrote this great book called the case for God

2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:32.000
 she's very interesting she was

2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:34.000
 a Catholic nun who sort of left that religion

2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:36.000
 and is but one of the smartest

2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:38.000
 thinkers in terms

2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:40.000
 of like accessible theological thinking

2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:42.000
 that's not tied to any particular religion

2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:44.000
 her whole argument

2:56:44.000 --> 2:56:46.000
 is that the way to understand religion you

2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:48.000
 first of all you have to go way back pre enlightenment where all this was formed

2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:50.000
 we got messed up thinking about religion

2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:52.000
 post enlightenment right and

2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:54.000
 um...

2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:56.000
 these are operating systems for making sense of intimations

2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:58.000
 the

2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:00.000
 one thing we had were these different intimations

2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:02.000
 of this field like ah

2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:04.000
 and mystical experience

2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:06.000
 and this feels something there's something you feel

2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:08.000
 when you act in a certain way and don't act in this other way

2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:10.000
 and it was like the scientists

2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:12.000
 who were trying to study

2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:14.000
 and understand the model of the atom by just looking at

2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:16.000
 experiments and trying to understand

2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:18.000
 what's going on like the great religions of the world were basically

2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:20.000
 figuring out how do we make

2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:22.000
 sense of these intimations and live in alignment

2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:24.000
 with them and build a life of meaning around that

2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:26.000
 what were the tools they were using

2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:28.000
 they were using ritual they were using belief

2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:30.000
 they were using action but all of it was like

2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:32.000
 an OS it was like a

2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:34.000
 liturgical model of the atom that

2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:36.000
 it's hard coded in so it did

2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:38.000
 through the

2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:40.000
 evolutionary process

2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:42.000
 they wouldn't have called it that back then or yeah

2:57:42.000 --> 2:57:44.000
 I mean whether they said who

2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:46.000
 they didn't have that as pre enlightenment they just say this is here

2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:48.000
 and

2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:50.000
 the directive is to try to live in alignment

2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:52.000
 with that

2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:54.000
 well then I want to ask who wrote the original code

2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:56.000
 that's the open question

2:57:56.000 --> 2:57:58.000
 yeah so Armstrong lays out this good argument and where it gets really interesting

2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:00.000
 is that she emphasizes

2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:02.000
 that all of this was considered

2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:04.000
 unethical right so the whole notion

2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:06.000
 and this is like rich and Jewish tradition in particular

2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:08.000
 and also an Islamic tradition

2:58:08.000 --> 2:58:10.000
 we can't comprehend and understand

2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:12.000
 what's going on here right and so

2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:14.000
 the best we can do to approximate understanding

2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:16.000
 and live in alignment is we act as if this is true

2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:18.000
 do these rituals

2:58:18.000 --> 2:58:20.000
 have these actions or whatever

2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:22.000
 post enlightenment a lot of that got

2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:24.000
 once we learned about enlightenment

2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:26.000
 we grew these suspicions

2:58:26.000 --> 2:58:28.000
 around religion that are very much of the modern

2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:30.000
 era right so like the

2:58:30.000 --> 2:58:32.000
 Karen Armstrong like Sam Harris's critique of religion

2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:34.000
 makes no sense

2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:36.000
 right the critiques based on

2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:38.000
 you're making the ascent to propositions that you think are true

2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:40.000
 for which you do not have evidence that they are true

2:58:40.000 --> 2:58:42.000
 that's an enlightenment thing right this is not

2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:44.000
 the context and this is not the religion

2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:46.000
 is the Rutherford model

2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:48.000
 of the atom like it's not actually maybe what

2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:50.000
 is underneath happening

2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:52.000
 but this model explains why your chemical equations

2:58:52.000 --> 2:58:54.000
 work and so this is like the way religion was

2:58:54.000 --> 2:58:56.000
 you there's a god we'll call it

2:58:56.000 --> 2:58:58.000
 this this is how it works we do this ritual we act

2:58:58.000 --> 2:59:00.000
 in this way it aligns with it just like the model

2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:02.000
 the atom predicted why you know

2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:04.000
 N.A. and C.L. is going to become salt this predicts

2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:06.000
 that you're going to feel and live in alignment right

2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:08.000
 it's like this beautiful sophisticated

2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:10.000
 theory which actually matches how a lot of

2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:12.000
 great theologians have you know thought

2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:14.000
 about it but then when you come forward

2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:16.000
 in time yeah maybe it's evolution I mean

2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:18.000
 this is like what Peterson hints at right

2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:20.000
 like he's basically

2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:22.000
 he's not

2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:24.000
 he doesn't like to get super pinned down

2:59:24.000 --> 2:59:26.000
 on this but it kind of seems where

2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:28.000
 he's almost like searching for the words

2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:30.000
 he focuses more like Jung and other people

2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:32.000
 but I mean I know he's very Jungian

2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:34.000
 but that same type of analysis

2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:36.000
 I think roughly speaking like Armstrong

2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:38.000
 is sort of a it's kind of like a Peter

2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:40.000
 Sony analysis but she's looking

2:59:40.000 --> 2:59:42.000
 more at the deep history of religion

2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:44.000
 then but yeah

2:59:44.000 --> 2:59:46.000
 he throws in an evolutionary

2:59:46.000 --> 2:59:48.000
 and I wonder what home it finds

2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:50.000
 I wonder what the new home is if religion

2:59:50.000 --> 2:59:52.000
 dissipates

2:59:52.000 --> 2:59:54.000
 with the new home for these kinds of

2:59:54.000 --> 2:59:56.000
 natural inclinations are

2:59:56.000 --> 2:59:58.000
 yeah with their technology

2:59:58.000 --> 3:00:00.000
 whether and if it's evolution I mean this is

3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:02.000
 Francis Collins's book also he's like well

3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:04.000
 that's a religious

3:00:04.000 --> 3:00:06.000
 that could be a very religious notion

3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:08.000
 I don't I think this stuff is interesting I'm not a very

3:00:08.000 --> 3:00:10.000
 religious person but I'm

3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:12.000
 I'm thinking it's not a bad idea

3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:14.000
 maybe what replaces honestly like maybe

3:00:14.000 --> 3:00:16.000
 what replaces religion is a return to

3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:18.000
 religion but in this

3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:20.000
 sort of more sophisticated

3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:22.000
 I mean if you went back

3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:24.000
 it's the issue with like a lot of the

3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:26.000
 recent critiques I think is it's

3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:28.000
 it's a strawman critique

3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:30.000
 in a complicated way right because

3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:32.000
 the whole way these the way this

3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:34.000
 works I mean the theologians if you're reading

3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:36.000
 if you're reading

3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:38.000
 if you're reading these people they're thinking

3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:40.000
 very sophisticated about religion in terms of this

3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:42.000
 it's ineffable and we're just these things

3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:44.000
 and this is deep it connects us to these

3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:46.000
 things in a way that puts life in alignment

3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:48.000
 we can't really explain what's going on because

3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:50.000
 our brains can't handle it right

3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:52.000
 for the average person though

3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:54.000
 this notion of live as if

3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:56.000
 it's kind of how religions work

3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:58.000
 is live as if this is true

3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:00.000
 it's like an OS for getting in alignment

3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:02.000
 with because we through

3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:04.000
 evolution like you behave in this way

3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:06.000
 do these which live as if this is true

3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:08.000
 gives you

3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:10.000
 what the goal you're looking for

3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:12.000
 but that's a complicated thing live as if this

3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:14.000
 is true because if you

3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:16.000
 especially if you're not a theologian to say

3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:18.000
 yeah this is not true

3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:20.000
 in an alignment sense but I'm living as if it kind of

3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:22.000
 takes the heat out of it but of course

3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:24.000
 it's what people are doing because

3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:26.000
 highly religious people still do bad things

3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:28.000
 where if you really were there's absolutely

3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:30.000
 a hell and I'm definitely going to go to it if I do this bad thing

3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:32.000
 you would never have

3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:34.000
 known whatever murder anyone if they were an evangelical Christian

3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:36.000
 right so it's like what

3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:38.000
 this is kind of a tangent that I'm

3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:40.000
 I'm on shaky ground here but

3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:42.000
 it's something I've been interested

3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:44.000
 often on a lot

3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:46.000
 I think we're in some sense searching for

3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:48.000
 because it does make for a good operating system

3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:50.000
 we're searching for a good

3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:52.000
 live as if X is true

3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:54.000
 and we're searching for a new X

3:01:54.000 --> 3:01:56.000
 and maybe artificial intelligence

3:01:56.000 --> 3:01:58.000
 will be the very

3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:00.000
 the new gods

3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:02.000
 that we're so desperately looking

3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:04.000
 for or it'll just spit out 42

3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:06.000
 I thought it was 27

3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:08.000
 Cal this is

3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:18.000
