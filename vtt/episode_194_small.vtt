 The following is a conversation with Brett Weinstein, evolutionary biologist, author,

00:05.280 --> 00:10.480
 cohost of the Dark Horse podcast, and, as he says, reluctant radical.

00:11.120 --> 00:16.480
 Even though we've never met or spoken before this, we both felt like we've been friends for a long

00:16.480 --> 00:22.720
 time. I don't agree on everything with Brett, but I'm sure as hell happy he exists in this weird

00:22.720 --> 00:29.840
 and wonderful world of ours. Quick mention of our sponsors, Jordan Harbinger Show, ExpressVPN,

00:29.840 --> 00:35.120
 Magik Spoon, and FourSigmatic. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:35.760 --> 00:42.080
 As a side note, let me say a few words about COVID 19 and about science broadly. I think science is

00:42.080 --> 00:48.240
 beautiful and powerful. It is the striving of the human mind to understand and to solve the

00:48.240 --> 00:54.160
 problems of the world. But as an institution, it is susceptible to the flaws of human nature,

00:54.160 --> 01:02.080
 to fear, to greed, power, and ego. 2020 is the story of all of these that has both scientific

01:02.080 --> 01:08.400
 triumph and tragedy. We needed great leaders, and we didn't get them. What we needed is leaders

01:08.400 --> 01:13.360
 who communicate in an honest, transparent, and authentic way about the uncertainty of what we

01:13.360 --> 01:18.800
 know and the large scale scientific efforts to reduce that uncertainty and to develop solutions.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.760
 I believe there are several candidates for solutions that could have all saved hundreds of

01:23.760 --> 01:30.800
 billions of dollars and lessened or eliminated the suffering of millions of people. Let me mention

01:30.800 --> 01:36.880
 five of the categories of solutions. Masks, at home testing, anonymized contact tracing,

01:36.880 --> 01:42.640
 antiviral drugs, and vaccines. Within each of these categories, institutional leaders should

01:42.640 --> 01:49.440
 have constantly asked and answered publicly, honestly, the following three questions. One,

01:49.440 --> 01:55.120
 what data do we have on the solution and what studies are we running to get more and better data?

01:55.120 --> 02:00.560
 Two, given the current data and uncertainty, how effective and how safe is the solution?

02:01.120 --> 02:06.160
 Three, what is the timeline and cost involved with mass manufacture and distribution of the

02:06.160 --> 02:11.680
 solution? In the service of these questions, no voices should have been silenced. No ideas

02:11.680 --> 02:17.520
 left off the table. Open data, open science, open honest scientific communication and debate

02:17.520 --> 02:24.720
 was the way, not censorship. There are a lot of ideas out there that are bad, wrong, dangerous,

02:24.720 --> 02:30.720
 but the moment we have the hubris to say we know which ideas those are is the moment we'll lose

02:30.720 --> 02:36.640
 our ability to find the truth, to find solutions, the very things that make science beautiful

02:36.640 --> 02:42.160
 and powerful in the face of all the dangers that threaten the well being and the existence of humans

02:42.160 --> 02:47.600
 on earth. This conversation with Brett is less about the ideas we talk about. We agree on some,

02:47.600 --> 02:54.240
 disagree on others. It is much more about the very freedom to talk, to think, to share ideas.

02:54.880 --> 03:01.040
 This freedom is our only hope. Brett should never have been censored. I asked Brett to do this

03:01.040 --> 03:07.120
 podcast, to show solidarity and to show that I have hope for science and for humanity.

03:08.080 --> 03:13.200
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here's my conversation with Brett Weinstein.

03:14.320 --> 03:20.240
 What to you is beautiful about the study of biology, the science, the engineering, the philosophy of

03:20.240 --> 03:27.920
 it? It's a very interesting question. I must say, at one level, it's not a conscious thing. I can

03:27.920 --> 03:35.120
 say a lot about why as an adult I find biology compelling, but as a kid, I was completely

03:35.120 --> 03:41.280
 fascinated with animals. I loved to watch them and think about why they did what they did,

03:41.280 --> 03:49.920
 and that developed into a very conscious passion as an adult, but I think in the same way that one

03:49.920 --> 04:00.560
 is drawn to a person, I was drawn to the never ending series of near miracles that exist across

04:00.560 --> 04:07.440
 biological nature. When you see a living organism, do you see it from an evolutionary biology

04:07.440 --> 04:12.800
 perspective of this entire thing that moves around in this world, or do you see from an engineering

04:12.800 --> 04:19.120
 perspective that are like first principles almost down to the physics, the little components that

04:19.120 --> 04:26.400
 build up hierarchies that you have cells, the first proteins and cells and organs and all

04:26.400 --> 04:31.840
 that kind of stuff. Do you see low level or do you see high level? Well, the human mind is a

04:31.840 --> 04:38.960
 strange thing, and I think it's probably a bit like a time sharing machine in which I have

04:38.960 --> 04:43.920
 different modules. We don't know enough about biology for them to connect, so they exist in

04:43.920 --> 04:50.080
 isolation, and I'm always aware that they do connect, but I basically have to step into a

04:50.080 --> 04:56.800
 module in order to see the evolutionary dynamics of the creature and the lineage that it belongs to.

04:56.800 --> 05:02.080
 I have to step into a different module to think of that lineage over a very long time scale,

05:02.080 --> 05:07.360
 a different module still to understand what the mechanisms inside would have to look like to account

05:07.360 --> 05:16.000
 for what we can see from the outside. I think that probably sounds really complicated, but

05:17.520 --> 05:24.240
 one of the things about being involved in a topic like biology and doing so for

05:24.240 --> 05:28.960
 one really not even just my adult life or my whole life is that it becomes second nature.

05:28.960 --> 05:36.000
 And when we see somebody do an amazing parkour routine or something like that,

05:36.880 --> 05:41.760
 we think about what they must be doing in order to accomplish that. But of course,

05:41.760 --> 05:48.880
 what they are doing is tapping into some kind of zone, right? They are in a zone in which they are

05:48.880 --> 05:55.920
 in such command of their center of gravity, for example, that they know how to hurl it around

05:55.920 --> 06:03.920
 a landscape so that they always land on their feet. And I would just say, for anyone who hasn't

06:03.920 --> 06:11.360
 found a topic on which they can develop that kind of facility, it is absolutely worthwhile.

06:11.360 --> 06:16.080
 It's really something that human beings are capable of doing across a wide range of topics.

06:16.080 --> 06:21.840
 Many things our ancestors didn't even have access to. And that flexibility of humans,

06:21.840 --> 06:30.240
 that ability to repurpose our machinery for topics that are novel, means really the world

06:30.240 --> 06:34.640
 is your oyster. You can figure out what your passion is and then figure out all of the angles

06:34.640 --> 06:40.880
 that one would have to pursue to really deeply understand it. And it is well worth having at

06:40.880 --> 06:48.480
 least one topic like that. You mean embracing the full adaptability of the both the body and the

06:48.480 --> 06:55.760
 mind? I don't know what to attribute the parkour to, like biomechanics of how our bodies can move

06:56.400 --> 07:04.880
 or is it the mind? How much percent wise is it the entirety of the hierarchies of biology that

07:04.880 --> 07:10.880
 we've been talking about or is it just all the mind? The way to think about creatures is that

07:10.880 --> 07:18.080
 every creature is two things simultaneously. A creature is a machine of sorts, right? It's not

07:18.080 --> 07:24.480
 a machine in the, I call it an aqueous machine, right? And it's run by an aqueous computer,

07:24.480 --> 07:31.760
 right? So it's not identical to our technological machines. But every creature is both a machine

07:31.760 --> 07:37.840
 that does things in the world sufficient to accumulate enough resources to continue surviving,

07:37.840 --> 07:45.440
 to reproduce. It is also a potential. So each creature is potentially, for example,

07:45.440 --> 07:49.520
 the most recent common ancestor of some future clade of creatures that will look very different

07:49.520 --> 07:55.440
 from it. And if a creature is very, very good at being a creature, but not very good in terms of

07:55.440 --> 08:01.280
 the potential it has going forward, then that lineage will not last very long into the future

08:01.280 --> 08:07.360
 because change will throw at challenges that its descendants will not be able to meet. So

08:07.360 --> 08:15.040
 the thing about humans is we are a generalist platform. And we have the ability to swap out

08:15.040 --> 08:22.720
 our software to exist in many, many different niches. And I was once watching an interview

08:22.720 --> 08:29.760
 with this British group of parkour experts who were being, they were discussing what it is they

08:29.760 --> 08:36.320
 do and how it works. And what they essentially said is, look, you're tapping into deep monkey

08:36.320 --> 08:45.360
 stuff, right? And I thought, yeah, that's about right. And anybody who is proficient at something

08:45.360 --> 08:55.200
 like skiing or skateboarding has the experience of flying down the hill on skis, for example,

08:55.200 --> 09:02.560
 bouncing from the top of one mogul to the next. And if you really pay attention, you will discover

09:02.560 --> 09:07.280
 that your conscious mind is actually a spectator. It's there. It's involved in the experience,

09:07.280 --> 09:10.560
 but it's not driving. Some part of you knows how to ski, and it's not the part of you that

09:10.560 --> 09:19.120
 knows how to think. And I would just say that what accounts for this flexibility in humans

09:19.120 --> 09:26.080
 is the ability to bootstrap a new software program and then drive it into the unconscious

09:26.080 --> 09:33.600
 layer where it can be applied very rapidly. And I will be shocked if the exact thing doesn't exist

09:33.600 --> 09:39.360
 in robotics. If you programmed a robot to deal with circumstances that were novel to it,

09:39.360 --> 09:41.840
 how would you do it? It would have to look something like this.

09:41.840 --> 09:47.920
 There's a certain kind of magic. You're right with the consciousness being an observer. When

09:47.920 --> 09:54.000
 you play guitar, for example, or piano, for me, music, when you get truly lost in it,

09:54.000 --> 09:59.680
 I don't know what the heck is responsible for the flow of the music, the kind of the loudness of

09:59.680 --> 10:05.440
 the music going up and down, the timing, the intricate, like even the mistakes, all those

10:05.440 --> 10:12.240
 things, that doesn't seem to be the conscious mind. It is just observing. And yet it's somehow

10:12.240 --> 10:18.240
 intricately involved. More, like you mentioned parkour, dances like that too. When you start

10:18.240 --> 10:25.120
 up in tango dancing, if when you truly lose yourself in it, then it's just like you're an

10:25.120 --> 10:29.680
 observer and how the hell is the body able to do that? And not only that, it's the physical

10:29.680 --> 10:38.640
 motion is also creating the emotion, the damn is good to be alive feeling.

10:40.640 --> 10:46.640
 But then that's also intricately connected to the full biology stack that we're operating in.

10:46.640 --> 10:52.000
 I don't know how difficult it is to replicate that we're talking offline about Boston Dynamics

10:52.000 --> 11:00.080
 robots. They've recently been, they did both parkour, they did flips, they've also done some dancing.

11:01.280 --> 11:07.600
 And it's something I think a lot about because what most people don't realize, because they

11:07.600 --> 11:14.320
 don't look deep enough is those robots are hard coded to do those things. The robots didn't

11:14.320 --> 11:20.240
 figure it out by themselves. And yet the fundamental aspect of what it means to be human is that

11:20.240 --> 11:25.440
 process of figuring out, of making mistakes. And then there's something about overcoming

11:25.440 --> 11:30.160
 those challenges and the mistakes and like figuring out how to lose yourself in the magic of the

11:30.160 --> 11:37.440
 dancing or just movement is what it means to be human that learning process. So that's what I

11:37.440 --> 11:45.760
 want to do with the almost as a fun side thing with the Boston Dynamics robots is to have them

11:45.760 --> 11:54.400
 learn and see what they figure out even if they make mistakes. I want to let spot make mistakes

11:55.040 --> 12:02.480
 and in so doing discover what it means to be alive, discover beauty because I think that's

12:02.480 --> 12:08.320
 the essential aspect of mistakes. Boston Dynamics folks want spot to be perfect

12:09.120 --> 12:12.880
 because they don't want spot to ever make mistakes because they want to operate in the

12:12.880 --> 12:18.240
 factories, they want to be very safe and so on. For me, if you construct the environment,

12:18.960 --> 12:25.120
 if you construct a safe space for robots and allow them to make mistakes, something beautiful

12:25.120 --> 12:31.200
 might be discovered. But that requires a lot of brain power. So spot is currently very dumb

12:31.200 --> 12:37.440
 and I'm going to add give it a brain. So first make it see currently can't see meaning computer

12:37.440 --> 12:42.720
 vision has to understand its environment has to see all the humans, but then also has to be able

12:42.720 --> 12:48.960
 to learn learn about its movement, learn how to use his body to communicate with others,

12:48.960 --> 12:53.680
 all those kinds of things that dogs know how to do well, humans know how to do somewhat well.

12:54.880 --> 12:59.840
 I think that's a beautiful challenge. But first you have to allow the robot to make mistakes.

12:59.840 --> 13:05.840
 Well, I think your objective is laudable, but you're going to realize that the Boston

13:05.840 --> 13:08.960
 Dynamics folks are right the first time spot poops on your rug.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.880
 I hear the same thing about kids and so on. Yes. I still want to have kids.

13:14.880 --> 13:20.080
 No, you should. It's a great experience. So let me step back into what you said in a couple

13:20.080 --> 13:26.560
 of different places. One, I've always believed that the missing element in robotics and

13:26.560 --> 13:33.440
 artificial intelligence is a proper development. It is no accident. It is no mere coincidence

13:33.440 --> 13:38.160
 that human beings are the most dominant species on planet earth and that we have the longest

13:38.160 --> 13:44.720
 childhoods of any creature on earth by far. Development is the key to the flexibility.

13:44.720 --> 13:55.600
 And so the capability of a human at adulthood is the mirror image. It's the flip side of our

13:55.600 --> 14:03.120
 helplessness at birth. So I'll be very interested to see what happens in your robot project if you

14:03.120 --> 14:09.840
 do not end up reinventing childhood for robots, which of course is foreshadowed in 2001 quite

14:09.840 --> 14:18.000
 brilliantly. But I also want to point out you can see this issue of your conscious mind becoming

14:18.000 --> 14:26.160
 a spectator very well if you compare tennis to table tennis. If you watch a tennis game,

14:26.960 --> 14:33.520
 you could imagine that the players are highly conscious as they play. You cannot imagine

14:33.520 --> 14:40.000
 that if you've ever played ping pong decently. A volley in ping pong is so fast that your conscious

14:40.000 --> 14:44.880
 mind, if your reactions had to go through your conscious mind, you wouldn't be able to play.

14:44.880 --> 14:50.720
 So you can detect that your conscious mind, while very much present, isn't there. And you can also

14:50.720 --> 14:57.600
 detect where consciousness does usefully intrude. If you go up against an opponent in table tennis

14:57.600 --> 15:03.360
 that knows a trick that you don't know how to respond to, you will suddenly detect that something

15:03.360 --> 15:08.560
 about your game is not effective. And you will start thinking about what might be, how do you

15:08.560 --> 15:12.880
 position yourself so that move that puts the ball just in that corner of the table or something

15:12.880 --> 15:22.000
 like that doesn't catch you off guard. And this, I believe, is we highly conscious folks,

15:22.000 --> 15:27.440
 those of us who try to think through things very deliberately and carefully, mistake consciousness

15:27.440 --> 15:34.000
 for the highest kind of thinking. And I really think that this is an error. Consciousness is an

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
 intermediate level of thinking. What it does is it allows you, it's basically like uncompiled code.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.920
 And it doesn't run very fast. It is capable of being adapted to new circumstances. But once the

15:45.920 --> 15:51.360
 code is roughed in, right, it gets driven into the unconscious layer, and you become highly

15:51.360 --> 15:56.080
 effective at whatever it is. And that from that point, your conscious mind basically remains

15:56.080 --> 16:00.240
 there to detect things that aren't anticipated by the code you've already written. And so

16:01.440 --> 16:07.360
 I don't exactly know how one would establish this, how one would demonstrate it. But it

16:07.360 --> 16:15.200
 must be the case that the human mind contains sandboxes in which things are tested, right?

16:15.200 --> 16:20.080
 Maybe you can build a piece of code and run it in parallel next to your active code so you can

16:20.080 --> 16:26.400
 see how it would have done comparatively. But there's got to be some way of writing new code

16:26.400 --> 16:31.120
 and then swapping it in. And frankly, I think this has a lot to do with things like sleep cycles.

16:31.120 --> 16:36.640
 Very often, you know, when I get good at something, I often don't get better at it while I'm doing it.

16:36.640 --> 16:41.040
 I get better at it when I'm not doing it, especially if there's time to sleep and think on it.

16:41.600 --> 16:46.880
 So there's some sort of, you know, new program swapping in for old program phenomenon,

16:46.880 --> 16:53.280
 which, you know, will be a lot easier to see in machines. It's going to be hard with the wetwear.

16:53.920 --> 16:57.920
 I like, I mean, it is true because somebody that played, I played tennis for many years,

16:58.640 --> 17:04.000
 I do still think the highest form of excellence in tennis is when the conscious mind is a

17:04.000 --> 17:12.800
 spectator. So it's the compiled code is the highest form of being human. And then consciousness is

17:12.800 --> 17:20.640
 just some like specific compiler. You just have like Borland C++ compiler. You could just have

17:20.640 --> 17:29.440
 different kind of compilers. Ultimately, the thing that by which we measure the power of life,

17:29.440 --> 17:33.680
 the intelligence of life is the compiled code. And you can probably do that compilation all kinds

17:33.680 --> 17:38.960
 of ways. Yeah. I'm not saying that tennis is played consciously and table tennis isn't. I'm

17:38.960 --> 17:45.280
 saying that because tennis is slowed down by the just the space on the court, you could imagine

17:45.280 --> 17:50.400
 that it was your conscious mind playing. But when you shrink the court down, it becomes obvious

17:50.400 --> 17:55.760
 that your conscious mind is just present rather than knowing where to put the paddle. And weirdly

17:55.760 --> 18:02.400
 for me, I would say this probably isn't true in a podcast situation. But if I have to give a

18:02.400 --> 18:08.560
 presentation, especially if I have not overly prepared, I often find the same phenomenon

18:08.560 --> 18:12.480
 when I'm giving the presentation, my conscious mind is there watching some other part of me

18:12.480 --> 18:20.000
 present, which is a little jarring, I have to say. Well, that means you've you've gotten good at it.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.440
 Not let the conscious mind get in the way of the flow of words.

18:24.640 --> 18:28.880
 Yeah, that's that's the sensation to be sure. And that's the highest form of podcasting too.

18:28.880 --> 18:34.080
 I mean, that's why I have that that's what it looks like when a podcast is really in the pocket

18:34.080 --> 18:41.360
 like like Joe Rogan just having fun and just losing themselves. And that's something I aspire to

18:41.360 --> 18:45.520
 as well, just losing yourself in conversation. Somebody that has a lot of anxiety with people

18:45.520 --> 18:50.000
 like I'm such an introvert. I'm scared. I was scared before you showed up. I'm scared right now.

18:50.800 --> 18:56.960
 There's just anxiety. There's just it's a giant mess. It's hard to lose yourself. It's hard to

18:56.960 --> 19:05.440
 just get out of the way of your own mind. Yeah, actually, trust is a big component of that. Your

19:05.440 --> 19:12.240
 conscious mind retains control if you are very uncertain. But when you do when you do get into

19:12.240 --> 19:16.560
 that zone, when you're speaking, I realize it's different for you with English as a second language,

19:16.560 --> 19:21.840
 although maybe you present in Russian and, you know, and it happens. But do you ever hear yourself

19:21.840 --> 19:26.880
 say something and you think, oh, that's really good, right? Like, like you didn't come up with it?

19:26.880 --> 19:33.680
 Some other part of you that you don't exactly know came up with it? I don't think I've ever

19:33.680 --> 19:39.760
 heard myself in that way because I have a much louder voice that's constantly yelling in my head

19:40.400 --> 19:46.640
 at why the hell did you say that? There's a very self critical voice. That's much louder.

19:46.640 --> 19:52.960
 So I'm very maybe I need to deal with that voice. But it's been like, what is it called,

19:52.960 --> 19:57.760
 like a megaphone just screaming so I can't hear. Oh, no, it says, good job. You said that thing

19:57.760 --> 20:04.160
 really nicely. So I'm kind of focused right now on the megaphone person in the audience versus

20:04.160 --> 20:09.360
 the deposit. But that's definitely something to think about. It's been productive. But,

20:10.560 --> 20:15.920
 you know, the place where I find gratitude and beauty and appreciation of life is in the quiet

20:15.920 --> 20:21.200
 moments when I don't talk, when I listen to the world around me, when I listen to others,

20:23.040 --> 20:28.800
 when I talk, I'm extremely self critical in my mind. When I when I produce anything out into

20:28.800 --> 20:34.880
 the world that's that originated with me, like any kind of creation, extremely self critical,

20:34.880 --> 20:41.760
 it's good for productivity, for like always striving to improve and so on. It might be bad for

20:41.760 --> 20:47.600
 for like, just appreciating the things you've created. I'm a little bit with Marvin

20:48.640 --> 20:55.760
 Minsky on this, where he says the key to to a productive life is to hate everything you've

20:55.760 --> 21:00.880
 ever done in the past. I didn't know he said that. I must say I resonate with it a bit.

21:02.160 --> 21:07.920
 And, you know, I, unfortunately, my life currently has me putting a lot of stuff into the world.

21:07.920 --> 21:12.720
 And, I effectively watch almost none of it. I can't stand it.

21:14.960 --> 21:20.480
 Yeah. What what do you make of that? I don't know. I just recently, I just yesterday read

21:20.480 --> 21:25.040
 Metamorphosis by Kafka, reread Metamorphosis by Kafka, where he turns into a giant bug

21:25.840 --> 21:30.720
 because of the stress that the world puts on him, his parents put on him to succeed.

21:30.720 --> 21:37.600
 And, you know, I think that's you have to find the balance because if you if you allow the

21:37.600 --> 21:42.160
 self critical voice to become too heavy, the burden of the world, the pressure

21:42.800 --> 21:46.400
 that the world puts on you to be the best version of yourself and so on to strive,

21:47.280 --> 21:54.560
 then you become a bug and that's a big problem. And then and then the world turns against you

21:54.560 --> 22:00.240
 because you're a bug. You become some kind of caricature of yourself. I don't know.

22:01.840 --> 22:08.080
 You become the worst version of yourself and then thereby end up destroying yourself and then

22:08.080 --> 22:14.080
 the world moves on. That's the story. That's a lovely story. I do think this is one of these

22:14.080 --> 22:20.160
 places and frankly, you could map this onto all of modern human experience, but this is one of

22:20.160 --> 22:26.160
 these places where our ancestral programming does not serve our modern selves. So I used to

22:26.160 --> 22:32.240
 talk to students about the question of dwelling on things. Dwelling on things is famously

22:32.960 --> 22:38.160
 understood to be bad and it can't possibly be bad. It wouldn't exist, the tendency toward it

22:38.160 --> 22:44.560
 wouldn't exist if it was bad. So what is bad is dwelling on things past the point of utility.

22:44.560 --> 22:51.440
 And that's obviously easier to say than to operationalize, but if you realize that your

22:51.440 --> 22:58.240
 dwelling is the key in fact to upgrading your program for future well being and that there's

22:58.240 --> 23:04.400
 a point presumably from diminishing returns, if not counter productivity, there is a point at

23:04.400 --> 23:09.760
 which you should stop because that is what is in your best interest, then knowing that you're

23:09.760 --> 23:14.240
 looking for that point is useful. This is the point at which it is no longer useful for me

23:14.240 --> 23:20.720
 to dwell on this error I have made. That's what you're looking for. And it also gives you license.

23:20.720 --> 23:27.520
 If some part of you feels like it's punishing you rather than searching, then that also has a

23:27.520 --> 23:32.560
 point at which it's no longer valuable and there's some liberty in realizing, yep,

23:33.200 --> 23:36.080
 even the part of me that was punishing me knows it's time to stop.

23:37.200 --> 23:42.160
 So if we map that onto compiled code discussion as a computer science person, I find that very

23:42.160 --> 23:52.960
 compelling. When you compile code, you get warnings sometimes. And usually, if you're a

23:52.960 --> 23:58.080
 good software engineer, you're going to make sure there's no, you treat warnings as errors.

23:58.800 --> 24:03.200
 So you make sure that the compilation produces no warnings. But at a certain point when you have

24:03.200 --> 24:09.200
 a large enough system, you just let the warnings go. It's fine. I don't know where that warning

24:09.200 --> 24:18.080
 came from. But ultimately, you need to compile the code and run with it. And I hope nothing terrible

24:18.080 --> 24:24.400
 happens. Well, I think what you will find, and believe me, I think what you're talking about

24:24.400 --> 24:31.440
 with respect to robots and learning is going to end up having to go to a deep developmental

24:31.440 --> 24:35.440
 state and a helplessness that evolves into hyper competence and all of that.

24:35.440 --> 24:44.560
 But I live, I noticed that I live by something that I, for lack of a better descriptor, call

24:44.560 --> 24:52.800
 the theory of close calls. And the theory of close calls says that people typically miscategorize

24:53.520 --> 25:01.040
 the events in their life where something almost went wrong. And, you know, for example, if you,

25:01.040 --> 25:06.320
 I have a friend who I was walking down the street with my college friends and one of my

25:06.320 --> 25:11.680
 friends stepped into the street thinking it was clear and was nearly hit by a car going 45 miles

25:11.680 --> 25:16.080
 an hour, would have been an absolute disaster. Might have killed her, certainly would have

25:16.080 --> 25:23.040
 permanently injured her. But she didn't, you know, car didn't touch her, right? Now, you could walk

25:23.040 --> 25:28.080
 away from that and think nothing of it because, well, what is there to think nothing happened?

25:28.080 --> 25:32.560
 Or you could think, well, what is the difference between what did happen and my death?

25:33.440 --> 25:38.480
 The difference is luck. I never want that to be true, right? I never want the difference

25:38.480 --> 25:44.160
 between what did happen and my death to be luck. Therefore, I should count this as very close to

25:44.160 --> 25:49.680
 death. And I should prioritize coding so it doesn't happen again at a very high level.

25:49.680 --> 26:00.160
 So anyway, my basic point is the accidents and disasters and misfortune describe a distribution

26:00.160 --> 26:08.400
 that tells you what's really likely to get you in the end. And so, personally, you can use them to

26:08.400 --> 26:13.280
 figure out where the dangers are so that you can afford to take great risks because you have a really

26:13.280 --> 26:17.280
 good sense of how they're going to go wrong. But I would also point out civilization has this

26:17.280 --> 26:24.720
 problem. Civilization is now producing these events that are major disasters, but they're not

26:24.720 --> 26:30.560
 existential scale yet, right? They're very serious errors that we can see. And I would argue that

26:30.560 --> 26:36.080
 the pattern is you discover that we are involved in some industrial process at the point it has gone

26:36.080 --> 26:43.360
 wrong, right? So I'm now always asking the question, okay, in light of the Fukushima

26:43.360 --> 26:51.760
 Triple Meltdown, the financial collapse of 2008, the Deepwater Horizon blowout COVID 19 and its

26:51.760 --> 26:59.760
 probable origins in the Wuhan lab, what processes do I not know the name of yet that I will discover

26:59.760 --> 27:04.960
 at the point that some gigantic accident has happened? And can we talk about the wisdom or

27:04.960 --> 27:10.080
 lack thereof of engaging in that process before the accident, right? That's what a wise civilization

27:10.080 --> 27:15.680
 would be doing. And yet we don't. I just want to mention something that happened a couple of days

27:15.680 --> 27:22.880
 ago. I don't know if you know who JB Straubel is. He's the cofounder of Tesla, CTO of Tesla for many,

27:22.880 --> 27:34.240
 many years. His wife just died. She was riding a bicycle. And in the same thin line between death

27:34.240 --> 27:40.320
 and life that many of us have been in where you walk into the intersection and there's this close

27:40.320 --> 27:54.160
 call. Every once in a while, you get the short straw. I wonder how much of our own individual lives

27:54.800 --> 27:59.360
 and the entirety of the human civilization rests on this little roll of the dice.

27:59.360 --> 28:05.600
 Well, this is sort of my point about the close calls is that there's a level at which we can't

28:05.600 --> 28:11.840
 control it, right? The gigantic asteroid that comes from deep space that you don't have time

28:11.840 --> 28:16.640
 to do anything about. There's not a lot we can do to hedge that out, or at least not short term.

28:17.920 --> 28:24.080
 But there are lots of other things. Obviously, the financial collapse of 2008 didn't

28:24.080 --> 28:30.000
 break down the entire world economy. It threatened to, but a Herculean effort managed to pull us back

28:30.000 --> 28:36.720
 from the brink. The triple meltdown at Fukushima was awful. But every one of the seven fuel pools

28:36.720 --> 28:41.520
 held, there wasn't a major fire that made it impossible to manage the disaster going forward.

28:41.520 --> 28:49.520
 We got lucky. We could say the same thing about the blowout at the Deepwater horizon,

28:49.520 --> 28:54.240
 where a hole in the ocean floor large enough that we couldn't have plugged it could have opened up.

28:54.240 --> 28:58.480
 All of these things could have been much, much worse. And I think we can say the same thing

28:58.480 --> 29:04.560
 about COVID as terrible as it is. And we cannot say for sure that it came from the Wuhan lab,

29:04.560 --> 29:10.240
 but there's a strong likelihood that it did. And it also could be much, much worse.

29:10.240 --> 29:16.800
 So in each of these cases, something is telling us we have a process that is unfolding that keeps

29:16.800 --> 29:21.040
 creating risks where it is luck that is the difference between us and some scale of disaster

29:21.040 --> 29:27.920
 that is unimaginable. And that wisdom, you can be highly intelligent and cause these disasters.

29:28.720 --> 29:35.600
 To be wise is to stop causing them. And that would require a process of restraint,

29:36.400 --> 29:41.760
 a process that I don't see a lot of evidence of yet. So I think we have to generate it.

29:41.760 --> 29:49.120
 And somehow, at the moment, we don't have a political structure that would be capable of

29:50.640 --> 29:56.560
 taking a protective algorithm and actually deploying it, because it would have important

29:56.560 --> 30:01.760
 economic consequences. And so it would almost certainly be shot down. But we can obviously

30:01.760 --> 30:10.240
 also say, we paid a huge price for all of the disasters that I've mentioned. And we have to

30:10.240 --> 30:14.640
 factor that into the equation. Something can be very productive short term and very destructive

30:14.640 --> 30:22.080
 long term. Also, the question is how many disasters we avoided because of the ingenuity

30:22.880 --> 30:29.440
 of humans or just the integrity and character of humans? That's sort of an open question.

30:30.160 --> 30:39.120
 We may be more intelligent than lucky. That's the hope. Because the optimistic message here that

30:39.120 --> 30:46.960
 you're getting at is maybe the process that we should be, that maybe we can overcome luck

30:46.960 --> 30:53.600
 with ingenuity. Meaning, I guess you're suggesting the process is we should be listing all the ways

30:53.600 --> 31:01.200
 that human civilization can destroy itself, assigning likelihood to it, and thinking through,

31:01.200 --> 31:08.400
 how can we avoid that? And being very honest with the data out there about the close calls

31:08.400 --> 31:15.520
 and using those close calls to then create sort of mechanism by which we minimize the

31:15.520 --> 31:22.160
 probability of those close calls. And just being honest and transparent with the data that's out

31:22.160 --> 31:29.600
 there. Well, I think we need to do a couple things for it to work. So I've been an advocate for the

31:29.600 --> 31:34.480
 idea that sustainability is actually, it's difficult to operationalize, but it is an objective

31:34.480 --> 31:40.480
 that we have to meet if we're to be around long term. And I realized that we also need to have

31:40.480 --> 31:46.320
 reversibility of all of our processes because processes very frequently when they start do

31:46.320 --> 31:52.240
 not appear dangerous. And then when they scale, they become very dangerous. So for example,

31:52.240 --> 31:59.520
 if you imagine the first internal combustion engine in a vehicle driving down the street,

31:59.520 --> 32:02.800
 and you imagine somebody running after them saying, hey, if you do enough of that,

32:02.800 --> 32:05.840
 you're going to alter the atmosphere and it's going to change the temperature of the planet,

32:05.840 --> 32:10.160
 it's preposterous, right? Why would you stop the person who's invented this marvelous new

32:10.160 --> 32:14.400
 contraption? But of course, eventually you do get to the place where you're doing enough of this

32:14.400 --> 32:20.560
 that you do start changing the temperature of the planet. So if we built the capacity, if we

32:20.560 --> 32:26.320
 basically said, look, you can't involve yourself in any process that you couldn't reverse if you

32:26.320 --> 32:34.400
 had to, then progress would be slowed, but our safety would go up dramatically. And I think

32:35.840 --> 32:40.560
 in some sense, if we are to be around long term, we have to begin thinking that way. We're just

32:40.560 --> 32:46.960
 involved in too many very dangerous processes. So let's talk about one of the things that,

32:46.960 --> 32:54.640
 if not threatened human civilization, certainly hurt it at a deep level, which is COVID 19.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.120
 What percent probability would you currently place

33:00.240 --> 33:05.360
 on the hypothesis that COVID 19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

33:06.160 --> 33:13.360
 So I maintain a flow chart of all the possible explanations. And it doesn't break down exactly

33:13.360 --> 33:21.200
 that way. The likelihood that it emerged from a lab is very, very high. If it emerged from a lab,

33:21.200 --> 33:24.400
 the likelihood that the lab was the Wuhan Institute is very, very high.

33:27.840 --> 33:33.120
 There are multiple different kinds of evidence that point to the lab. And there is literally no

33:33.120 --> 33:38.320
 evidence that points to nature. Either the evidence points nowhere or it points to the lab. And the

33:38.320 --> 33:44.720
 lab could mean any lab, but geographically, obviously, the labs in Wuhan are the most likely.

33:44.720 --> 33:50.320
 And the lab that was most directly involved with research on viruses that look like COVID,

33:50.320 --> 33:56.720
 that look like SARS COVID 2, is obviously the place that one would start. But I would say

33:56.720 --> 34:05.520
 the likelihood that this virus came from a lab is well above 95%. We can talk about the question of

34:05.520 --> 34:09.760
 could a virus have been brought into the lab and escaped from there without being modified?

34:09.760 --> 34:16.160
 That's also possible. But it doesn't explain any of the anomalies in the genome of SARS COVID 2.

34:17.840 --> 34:22.080
 Could it have been delivered from another lab? Could Wuhan be a distraction

34:22.960 --> 34:28.240
 in order that we would connect the dots in the wrong way? That's conceivable. I currently have

34:28.240 --> 34:34.560
 that below 1% on my flow chart. But I think very dark thought that somebody would do that almost as

34:34.560 --> 34:41.600
 a political attack on China. Well, it depends. I don't even think that's one possibility.

34:42.240 --> 34:48.320
 Sometimes when Eric and I talk about these issues, we will generate a scenario just to prove that

34:48.320 --> 34:53.680
 something could live in that space. It's a placeholder for whatever may actually have happened.

34:53.680 --> 34:59.200
 And so it doesn't have to have been an attack on China. That's certainly one possibility.

34:59.200 --> 35:07.840
 But I would point out, if you can predict the future in some unusual way better than others,

35:08.400 --> 35:12.720
 you can print money. That's what markets that allow you to bet for or against

35:14.240 --> 35:21.760
 virtually any sector allow you to do. So you can imagine simply a moral

35:21.760 --> 35:29.120
 person or entity generating a pandemic attempting to cover their tracks because it would allow them

35:29.120 --> 35:36.800
 to bet against things like cruise ships, air travel, whatever it is and bet in favor of,

35:36.800 --> 35:45.840
 I don't know, sanitizing gel and whatever else you would do. So am I saying that I think somebody

35:45.840 --> 35:49.920
 did that? No, I really don't think it happened. We've seen zero evidence that this was intentionally

35:49.920 --> 35:56.400
 released. However, were it to have been intentionally released by somebody who did not know, did not

35:56.400 --> 36:01.760
 want it known where it had come from. Releasing it in Wuhan would be one way to cover their tracks.

36:01.760 --> 36:06.720
 So we have to leave the possibility formally open, but acknowledge there's no evidence.

36:07.280 --> 36:13.600
 And the probability, therefore, is low. I tend to believe maybe this is the optimistic nature

36:13.600 --> 36:20.320
 that I have that people who are competent enough to do the kind of thing we just described

36:21.600 --> 36:26.880
 are not going to do that because it requires a certain kind of, I don't want to use the word

36:26.880 --> 36:33.600
 eval, but whatever word you want to use to describe the kind of this regard for human life

36:33.600 --> 36:41.120
 required to do that. It's just not going to be coupled with competence. I feel like there's a

36:41.120 --> 36:47.040
 trade off chart where competence on one axis and evils on the other. And the more evil you become,

36:48.640 --> 36:55.680
 the crapper you are at doing great engineering scientific work required to deliver weapons of

36:55.680 --> 36:59.680
 different kinds, whether it's bioweapons or nuclear weapons, all those kinds of things.

36:59.680 --> 37:05.040
 That seems to be the lessons I take from history, but that doesn't necessarily mean that's what's

37:05.040 --> 37:12.000
 going to be happening in the future. But to stick on the lab leak idea, because the flowchart is

37:12.000 --> 37:16.640
 probably huge here, because there's a lot of fascinating possibilities. One question I want

37:16.640 --> 37:24.480
 to ask is what would evidence for natural origins look like? So one piece of evidence for natural

37:24.480 --> 37:35.680
 origins is that it's happened in the past that viruses have jumped. Oh, they do jump. So that's

37:36.880 --> 37:43.520
 possible to have happened. So that's a sort of like a historical evidence like, okay, well,

37:43.520 --> 37:49.680
 it's possible that it happened. It's not evidence of the kind you think it is. It's a justification

37:49.680 --> 37:55.600
 for a presumption. So the presumption upon discovering a new virus circulating is certainly

37:55.600 --> 38:01.920
 that it came from nature. The problem is the presumption evaporates in the face of evidence,

38:01.920 --> 38:07.600
 or at least it logically should. And it didn't in this case. It was maintained by people who

38:07.600 --> 38:13.520
 privately in their emails acknowledged that they had grave doubts about the natural origin of this

38:13.520 --> 38:20.640
 virus. Is there some other piece of evidence that we could look for and see that would say

38:21.680 --> 38:28.160
 this increases the probability that it's natural origins? Yeah. In fact, there is evidence. I always

38:28.160 --> 38:35.760
 worry that somebody is going to make up some evidence in order to reverse the flow. Well,

38:35.760 --> 38:39.600
 let's say I am a lot of incentive for that, actually, there's a huge amount of incentive. On

38:39.600 --> 38:45.360
 the other hand, why didn't the powers that be the powers that lied to us about weapons of mass

38:45.360 --> 38:50.000
 destruction in Iraq? Why didn't they ever fake weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? Whatever

38:50.000 --> 38:54.800
 force it is, I hope that force is here too. And so whatever evidence we find is real.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.920
 It's the competence thing I'm talking about. But okay, go ahead. Sorry.

38:58.720 --> 39:04.560
 Well, we can get back to that. But I would say, yeah, the giant piece of evidence that will shift

39:04.560 --> 39:10.720
 the probabilities in the other direction is the discovery of either a human population in which

39:10.720 --> 39:16.320
 the virus circulated prior to showing up in Wuhan that would explain where the virus learned all

39:16.320 --> 39:22.400
 of the tricks that it knew instantly upon spreading from Wuhan. So that would do it or

39:22.400 --> 39:29.280
 an animal population in which an ancestor epidemic can be found in which the virus learned this

39:29.280 --> 39:35.040
 before jumping to humans. But I'd point out in that second case, you would certainly expect to see

39:35.040 --> 39:41.760
 a great deal of evolution in the early epidemic, which we don't see. So there almost has to be

39:41.760 --> 39:46.720
 a human population somewhere else that had the virus circulating or an ancestor of the virus

39:46.720 --> 39:51.760
 that we first saw in Wuhan circulating. And it has to have gotten very sophisticated in that prior

39:51.760 --> 39:57.920
 epidemic before hitting Wuhan in order to explain the total lack of evolution and extremely effective

39:57.920 --> 40:03.680
 virus that emerged at the end of 2019. So you don't believe in the magic of evolution to

40:03.680 --> 40:07.280
 spring up with all the tricks already there? Like everybody who doesn't have the tricks,

40:07.280 --> 40:12.720
 they die quickly. And then you just have this beautiful virus that comes in with the spike

40:12.720 --> 40:23.760
 protein and the through mutation and selection. The ones that succeed and succeed big are the

40:23.760 --> 40:29.840
 ones that are going to just spring into life with the tricks. Well, no. That's called a hopeful

40:29.840 --> 40:37.520
 monster and hopeful monsters don't work. The job of becoming a new pandemic virus is too difficult.

40:37.520 --> 40:42.160
 It involves two very difficult steps and they both have to work. One is the ability to infect a

40:42.160 --> 40:48.080
 person and spread in their tissues sufficient to make an infection. And the other is to jump between

40:48.080 --> 40:52.480
 individuals at a sufficient rate that it doesn't go extinct for one reason or another.

40:52.480 --> 40:58.720
 Those are both very difficult jobs. They require, as you describe, selection. And the point is,

40:58.720 --> 41:02.160
 selection would leave a mark. We would see evidence that it would stay in place.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.200
 In animals or humans, we would see both, right?

41:05.200 --> 41:10.560
 And we see this evolutionary trace of the virus gathering the tricks out.

41:10.560 --> 41:14.480
 Yeah. You would see the virus, you would see the clumsy virus get better and better. And yes,

41:14.480 --> 41:20.160
 I am a full believer in the power of that process. In fact, I believe it. What I know

41:20.160 --> 41:25.600
 from studying the process is that it is much more powerful than most people imagine, that what we

41:25.600 --> 41:32.240
 teach in the Evolution 101 textbook is too clumsy a process to do what we see it doing and that

41:32.240 --> 41:38.400
 actually people should increase their expectation of the rapidity with which that process can produce

41:39.600 --> 41:44.880
 just jaw dropping adaptations. That said, we just don't see evidence that it happened here,

41:44.880 --> 41:50.560
 which doesn't mean it doesn't exist. But it means, in spite of immense pressure to find it somewhere,

41:50.560 --> 41:55.520
 there's been no hint, which probably means it took place inside of a laboratory.

41:55.520 --> 42:03.680
 So inside the laboratory, gain a function research on viruses. And I believe most of

42:03.680 --> 42:07.600
 that kind of research is doing this exact thing that you're referring to, which is

42:07.600 --> 42:12.480
 accelerated evolution. And just watching evolution do its thing on a bunch of viruses

42:12.480 --> 42:21.520
 and seeing what kind of tricks get developed. The other method is engineering viruses. So

42:22.640 --> 42:30.240
 manually adding on the tricks. Which do you think we should be thinking about here?

42:30.880 --> 42:36.480
 So mind you, I learned what I know in the aftermath of this pandemic emerging. I

42:36.480 --> 42:42.800
 started studying the question. And I would say, based on the content of the genome and other

42:42.800 --> 42:49.360
 evidence in publications from the various labs that were involved in generating this technology,

42:50.240 --> 42:58.400
 a couple of things seem likely. This SARS CoV2 does not appear to be entirely the result of

42:58.400 --> 43:06.320
 either a splicing process or serial passaging. It appears to have both things in its past.

43:07.120 --> 43:11.040
 Or it's at least highly likely that it does. So for example, the Fern cleavage site

43:11.680 --> 43:17.200
 looks very much like it was added in to the virus. And it was known that that would increase its

43:17.200 --> 43:28.880
 infectivity in humans and increase its tropism. The virus appears to be excellent at spreading

43:28.880 --> 43:34.880
 in humans and minks and ferrets. Now minks and ferrets are very closely related to each other

43:34.880 --> 43:40.000
 and ferrets are very likely to have been used in a serial passage experiment. The reason being

43:40.000 --> 43:44.640
 that they have an ACE2 receptor that looks very much like the human ACE2 receptor. And so

43:44.640 --> 43:50.640
 were you going to passage the virus or its ancestor through an animal in order to increase

43:50.640 --> 43:55.280
 its infectivity in humans, which would have been necessary, ferrets would have been very

43:55.280 --> 44:02.800
 likely. It is also quite likely that humanized mice were utilized. And it is possible that human

44:02.800 --> 44:09.200
 airway tissue was utilized. I think it is vital that we find out what the protocols were. If this

44:09.200 --> 44:13.840
 came from the Wuhan Institute, we need to know it and we need to know what the protocols were

44:13.840 --> 44:20.800
 exactly because they will actually give us some tools that would be useful in fighting SARS CoV2

44:20.800 --> 44:25.440
 and hopefully driving it to extinction, which ought to be our priority. It is a priority that

44:25.440 --> 44:31.440
 does not, it is not apparent from our behavior, but it really is. It should be our objective if we

44:31.440 --> 44:38.000
 understood where our interests lie. We would be much more focused on it. But those protocols would

44:38.000 --> 44:42.960
 tell us a great deal. If it wasn't the Wuhan Institute, we need to know that. If it was nature,

44:42.960 --> 44:46.560
 we need to know that. And if it was some other laboratory, we need to figure out

44:47.360 --> 44:53.040
 what and where so that we can determine what we can determine about what was done.

44:53.040 --> 44:58.400
 You're opening up my mind about why we should investigate, why we should know the truth

44:59.120 --> 45:05.680
 of the origins of this virus. So for me personally, let me just tell the story of my own kind of journey.

45:05.680 --> 45:15.120
 When I first started looking into the lab leak hypothesis, what became terrifying to me and

45:15.120 --> 45:22.720
 important to understand and obvious is the sort of like Sam Harris way of thinking, which is

45:23.600 --> 45:30.320
 it's obvious that a lab leak of a deadly virus will eventually happen. My mind was,

45:30.320 --> 45:36.000
 it doesn't even matter if it happened in this case. It's obvious it's going to happen in the future.

45:36.560 --> 45:41.760
 So why the hell are we not freaking out about this? And COVID 19 is not even that deadly

45:41.760 --> 45:46.880
 relative to the possible future viruses. It's the way I disagree with Sam on this,

45:46.880 --> 45:52.160
 but he thinks about this way about AGI as well, not about artificial intelligence. It's a different

45:52.160 --> 45:56.800
 discussion, I think, but with viruses, it seems like something that could happen on the scale of

45:56.800 --> 46:03.280
 years, maybe a few decades. AGI is a little bit farther out for me, but it seemed the terrifying

46:03.280 --> 46:10.080
 thing seemed obvious that this will happen very soon for a much deadlier virus as we get better

46:10.080 --> 46:15.920
 and better at both engineering viruses and doing this kind of evolutionary driven research,

46:15.920 --> 46:22.640
 gain a function research. Okay, but then you started speaking out about this as well, but

46:22.640 --> 46:27.440
 also started to say, no, no, no, we should hurry up and figure out the origins now because they

46:27.440 --> 46:35.680
 will help us figure out how to actually respond to this particular virus, how to treat this

46:35.680 --> 46:40.960
 particular virus, what is in terms of vaccines, in terms of antiviral drugs, in terms of just

46:40.960 --> 46:50.960
 hand, although the number of responses we should have. Okay, I still am much more freaking out

46:50.960 --> 47:02.560
 about the future. Maybe you can break that apart a little bit. Which are you most focused on now?

47:02.560 --> 47:08.800
 Which are you most freaking out about now in terms of the importance of figuring out the origins of

47:08.800 --> 47:15.040
 this virus? I am most freaking out about both of them because they're both really important and

47:15.040 --> 47:21.040
 we can put bounds on this. Let me say first that this is a perfect test case for the theory of

47:21.040 --> 47:26.880
 close calls because as much as COVID is a disaster, it is also a close call from which we can learn

47:26.880 --> 47:34.880
 much. You are absolutely right. If we keep playing this game in the lab, especially if we do it

47:34.880 --> 47:39.920
 under pressure and when we are told that a virus is going to leap from nature any day and that the

47:39.920 --> 47:45.200
 more we know, the better we'll be able to fight it, we're going to create the disaster sooner.

47:45.200 --> 47:51.280
 Yes, that should be an absolute focus. The fact that there were people saying that this was dangerous

47:51.280 --> 47:58.480
 back in 2015 ought to tell us something. The fact that the system bypassed a ban and offshored the

47:58.480 --> 48:03.280
 work to China ought to tell us this is not a Chinese failure. This is a failure of something

48:03.280 --> 48:13.280
 larger and harder to see. But I also think that there's a clock ticking with respect to SARS

48:13.280 --> 48:18.880
 CoV2 and COVID, the disease that it creates. That has to do with whether or not we are stuck

48:18.880 --> 48:24.800
 with it permanently. If you think about the cost to humanity of being stuck with influenza,

48:24.800 --> 48:29.600
 it's an immense cost year after year. We just stopped thinking about it because it's there.

48:29.600 --> 48:34.320
 Some years you get to flu, most years you don't. Maybe you get the vaccine to prevent it. Maybe

48:34.320 --> 48:39.920
 the vaccine isn't particularly well targeted. But imagine just simply doubling that cost.

48:40.960 --> 48:46.320
 Imagine we get stuck with SARS CoV2 and its descendants going forward and that

48:47.120 --> 48:53.040
 it just settles in and becomes a fact of modern human life. That would be a disaster. The number

48:53.040 --> 48:57.520
 of people we will ultimately lose is incalculable. The amount of suffering that will be caused is

48:57.520 --> 49:04.720
 incalculable, the loss of well being and wealth incalculable. That ought to be a very high priority

49:04.720 --> 49:09.920
 driving this extinct before it becomes permanent. The ability to drive extinct

49:10.800 --> 49:18.320
 goes down the longer we delay effective responses to the extent that we let it have this very large

49:18.320 --> 49:24.160
 canvas, large numbers of people who have the disease in which mutation and selection can result

49:24.160 --> 49:29.440
 in adaptation that we will not be able to counter the greater its ability to figure out features

49:29.440 --> 49:37.200
 of our immune system and use them to its advantage. I'm feeling the pressure of driving an extinct.

49:37.200 --> 49:42.240
 I believe we could have driven an extinct six months ago and we didn't do it because of very

49:42.240 --> 49:49.920
 mundane concerns among a small number of people. I'm not alleging that they were brazen about

49:49.920 --> 49:56.080
 or that they were callous about deaths that would be caused. I have the sense that they

49:56.080 --> 50:01.920
 were working from a kind of autopilot in which let's say you're in some kind of a

50:01.920 --> 50:10.000
 pharmaceutical corporation. You have a portfolio of therapies that in the context of a pandemic

50:10.000 --> 50:14.960
 might be very lucrative. Those therapies have competitors. You of course want to position

50:14.960 --> 50:21.760
 your product so that it succeeds and the competitors don't and lo and behold at some point through

50:21.760 --> 50:28.480
 means that I think those of us on the outside can't really into it. You end up saying things

50:28.480 --> 50:33.840
 about competing therapies that work better and much more safely than the ones you're selling

50:33.840 --> 50:41.280
 that aren't true and do cause people to die in large numbers, but it's some kind of autopilot,

50:41.280 --> 50:49.840
 at least part of it is. There's a complicated coupling of the autopilot of institutions,

50:51.200 --> 50:58.320
 companies, governments, and then there's also the geopolitical game theory thing going on

50:58.320 --> 51:03.520
 where you want to keep secrets. It's the Chernobyl thing where if you messed up,

51:03.520 --> 51:12.000
 there's a big incentive, I think, to hide the fact that you messed up. So how do we fix this?

51:12.560 --> 51:19.680
 And what's more important to fix? The autopilot, which is the response that we often criticize

51:19.680 --> 51:25.040
 about our institutions, especially the leaders in those institutions, Anthony Fauci and so on,

51:25.040 --> 51:34.160
 as some of the members of the scientific community. And the second part is the game with China

51:35.040 --> 51:39.120
 of hiding the information in terms of on the fight between nations.

51:40.160 --> 51:44.960
 Well, in our live streams on Dark Horse, Heather and I have been talking from the beginning about

51:44.960 --> 51:51.600
 the fact that although, yes, what happens began in China, it very much looks like a failure of

51:51.600 --> 51:58.400
 the international scientific community. That's frightening. But it's also hopeful in the sense

51:58.400 --> 52:04.480
 that actually, if we did the right thing now, we're not navigating a puzzle about Chinese

52:04.480 --> 52:11.040
 responsibility. We're navigating a question of collective responsibility for something that has

52:11.040 --> 52:19.120
 been terribly costly to all of us. So that's not a very happy process. But as you point out,

52:19.120 --> 52:24.320
 what's at stake is in large measure, at the very least, the strong possibility this will happen

52:24.320 --> 52:31.200
 again, and that at some point, it will be far worse. So just as a person that does not learn

52:31.200 --> 52:36.400
 the lessons of their own errors, doesn't get smarter and they remain in danger,

52:37.200 --> 52:43.600
 we collectively, humanity has to say, well, there sure is a lot of evidence that suggests

52:43.600 --> 52:49.120
 that this is a self inflicted wound. When you have done something that has caused a massive

52:49.120 --> 52:56.160
 self inflicted wound, self inflicted wound, it makes sense to dwell on it exactly to the

52:56.160 --> 53:00.720
 point that you have learned the lesson that makes it very, very unlikely that something similar

53:00.720 --> 53:05.360
 will happen again. I think this is a good place to kind of ask you to do almost like a thought

53:05.360 --> 53:19.680
 experiment, or to steel man the argument against the lab leak hypothesis. So if you were to argue,

53:20.800 --> 53:27.920
 you know, you said 95% chance that it the virus leaf from a lab, there's a bunch of ways I think

53:27.920 --> 53:39.200
 you can argue that even talking about it is bad for the world. So if I just put something on the

53:39.200 --> 53:50.240
 table is to say that for one, it would be racism versus Chinese people that talking about that it

53:50.240 --> 53:56.160
 leaked from a lab, there's a kind of immediate kind of blame and it can spiral down into this idea

53:56.160 --> 54:02.640
 that's somehow the people are responsible for the virus and this kind of thing. Is it possible for

54:02.640 --> 54:10.240
 you to come up with other steel man arguments against talking or against the possibility

54:10.240 --> 54:17.680
 of the lab leak hypothesis? Well, so I think steel manning is a tool that is extremely

54:18.320 --> 54:25.040
 valuable, but it's also possible to abuse it. I think that you can only steel man a good faith

54:25.040 --> 54:31.280
 argument. And the problem is we now know that we have not been engaged in opponents who were

54:31.280 --> 54:36.400
 wielding good faith arguments because privately their emails reflect their own doubts. And what

54:36.400 --> 54:42.080
 they were doing publicly was actually a punishment, a public punishment for those of us who spoke up

54:43.040 --> 54:49.680
 with I think the purpose of either backing us down or more likely warning others not to engage

54:49.680 --> 54:56.320
 in the same kind of behavior. And obviously for people like you and me who regard science as our

54:57.200 --> 55:04.160
 likely best hope for navigating difficult waters, shutting down people who are using those tools

55:04.160 --> 55:12.240
 honorably is itself dishonorable. So I don't feel that it is, I don't feel that there's

55:12.240 --> 55:19.040
 anything to steel man. And I also think that immediately at the point that the world suddenly

55:19.040 --> 55:24.480
 with no new evidence on the table switched gears with respect to the lab leak, at the point that

55:24.480 --> 55:28.640
 Nicholas Wade had published his article and suddenly the world was going to admit that this

55:28.640 --> 55:35.920
 was at least a possibility if not a likelihood, we got to see something of the rationalization

55:35.920 --> 55:41.600
 process that had taken place inside the institutional world. And it very definitely involved the claim

55:41.600 --> 55:49.920
 that what was being avoided was the targeting of Chinese scientists. And my point would be,

55:49.920 --> 55:56.240
 I don't want to see the targeting of anyone. I don't want to see racism of any kind. On the other

55:56.240 --> 56:05.840
 hand, once you create license to lie in order to protect individuals when the world has a stake

56:05.840 --> 56:11.920
 in knowing what happened, then it is inevitable that that process, that license to lie will be

56:11.920 --> 56:18.480
 used by the thing that captures institutions for its own purposes. So my sense is it may be very

56:18.480 --> 56:27.200
 unfortunate if the story of what happened here can be used against Chinese people. That would be

56:27.200 --> 56:33.760
 very unfortunate. And as I think I mentioned, Heather and I have taken great pains to point out

56:33.760 --> 56:37.280
 that this doesn't look like a Chinese failure. It looks like a failure of the international

56:37.280 --> 56:43.040
 scientific community. So I think it is important to broadcast that message along with the analysis

56:43.040 --> 56:49.360
 of the evidence. But no matter what happened, we have a right to know. And I frankly do not

56:49.360 --> 56:54.160
 take the institutional layer at its word that its motivations are honorable and that it was

56:54.160 --> 57:00.240
 protecting goodhearted scientists at the expense of the world. That explanation does not add up.

57:00.240 --> 57:07.200
 Well, this is a very interesting question about whether it's ever okay to lie at the institutional

57:07.200 --> 57:15.840
 layer to protect the populace. I think both you and I are probably on the same,

57:18.240 --> 57:24.800
 have the same sense that it's a slippery slope, even if it's an effective mechanism in the short

57:24.800 --> 57:31.120
 term, in the long term, it's going to be destructive. This happened with masks. This

57:31.120 --> 57:38.960
 happened with other things. If you look at just history pandemics, there's an idea that panic

57:38.960 --> 57:45.280
 is destructive amongst the populace. So you want to construct a narrative, whether it's a lie or

57:45.280 --> 57:53.760
 not, to minimize panic. But you're suggesting that almost in all cases, and I think that was

57:53.760 --> 58:04.320
 the lesson from the pandemic in the early 20th century, that lying creates distrust and distrust

58:05.120 --> 58:10.800
 in the institutions is ultimately destructive. That's your sense that lying is not okay?

58:10.800 --> 58:16.880
 Well, okay. There are obviously places where complete transparency is not a good idea,

58:16.880 --> 58:22.720
 right, to the extent that you broadcast a technology that allows one individual to hold

58:22.720 --> 58:29.520
 the world hostage. Obviously, you've got something to be navigated. But in general,

58:29.520 --> 58:37.840
 I don't believe that the scientific system should be lying to us. In the case of this

58:37.840 --> 58:47.040
 particular lie, the idea that the well being of Chinese scientists outweighs the well being of

58:47.040 --> 58:53.920
 the world is preposterous. As you point out, one thing that rests on this question is whether we

58:53.920 --> 58:58.800
 continue to do this kind of research going forward. And the scientists in question, all of them,

58:58.800 --> 59:06.080
 American, Chinese, all of them were pushing the idea that the risk of a zoonotic spillover event

59:06.080 --> 59:12.240
 causing a major and highly destructive pandemic was so great that we had to risk this. Now,

59:12.240 --> 59:17.760
 if they themselves have caused it, and if they are wrong, as I believe they are, about the likelihood

59:17.760 --> 59:23.280
 of a major world pandemic spilling out of nature in the way that they wrote into their grant

59:23.280 --> 59:28.160
 applications, then the danger is, you know, the call is coming from inside the house. And

59:29.200 --> 59:36.080
 we have to look at that. And yes, whatever we have to do to protect scientists from

59:36.080 --> 59:44.080
 retribution, we should do. But we cannot protect them by lying to the world. And even worse,

59:45.120 --> 59:58.480
 by demonizing people like me, like Josh Rogan, like Yuri Dagan, the entire drastic group on

59:58.480 --> 1:00:04.880
 Twitter, by demonizing us for simply following the evidence is to set a terrible precedent.

1:00:04.880 --> 1:00:10.000
 Right. You're demonizing people for using the scientific method to evaluate evidence that is

1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:15.840
 available to us in the world. What a terrible crime it is to teach that lesson, right?

1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:20.640
 Thou shalt not use scientific tools. No, I'm sorry. Whatever your license to lie is,

1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:27.200
 it doesn't extend to that. Yeah, I've seen the attacks on you, the pressure on you has a very

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:38.400
 important effect on thousands of world class biologists actually at MIT, colleagues of mine,

1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:49.200
 people I know, there's a slight pressure to not be allowed to one speak publicly and to actually

1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:55.440
 think. Like, do you even think about these ideas? It sounds kind of ridiculous, but just to

1:00:55.440 --> 1:01:03.520
 the, in the privacy of your own home, to read things, to think, it's many people, many world

1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:11.760
 class biologists that I know will just avoid looking at the data. There's not even that many

1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:17.680
 people that are publicly opposed and gain a function research. They're also like, it's not

1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:22.960
 worth it. It's not worth the battle. And there's many people that kind of argue that those battles

1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:31.200
 should be fought in private with colleagues in the privacy of the scientific community,

1:01:31.200 --> 1:01:38.160
 that the public is somehow not maybe intelligent enough to be able to deal with the complexities

1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:43.440
 of this kind of discussion. I don't know, but the final result is combined with the bullying of you

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:50.560
 and all the different pressures in the academic institutions is that it's just people are self

1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:56.000
 censoring and silencing themselves and silencing the most important thing, which is the power of

1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:03.680
 their brains. Like, these people are brilliant. And the fact that they're not utilizing their brain

1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:10.560
 to come up with solutions outside of the conformist line of thinking is tragic.

1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:18.080
 Well, it is. I also think that we have to look at it and understand it for what it is. For one

1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:23.360
 thing, it's kind of a cryptic totalitarianism. Somehow people's sense of what they're allowed

1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:28.480
 to think about, talk about, discuss is causing them to self censor. And I can tell you it's

1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:32.480
 causing many of them to rationalize, which is even worse. They're blinding themselves to what

1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:39.680
 they can see. But it is also the case, I believe, that what you're describing about what people

1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:46.880
 said and a great many people understood that the lab leak hypothesis could not be taken off the table.

1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:53.360
 But they didn't say so publicly. And I think that their discussions with each other about why they

1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:59.360
 did not say what they understood, that's what captures sounds like on the inside. I don't

1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:06.560
 know exactly what force captured the institutions. I don't think anybody knows for sure out here

1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:12.960
 in public. I don't even know that it wasn't just simply a process, but you have these institutions.

1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:20.800
 They are behaving towards a kind of somatic obligation. They have lost sight of what they

1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:28.320
 were built to accomplish. And on the inside, the way they avoid going back to their original mission

1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:33.360
 is to say things to themselves like, the public can't have this discussion, it can't be trusted

1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:37.200
 with it. Yes, we need to be able to talk about this, but it has to be private, whatever it is

1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:42.320
 they say to themselves, that is what capture sounds like on the inside. It's a institutional

1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:48.880
 rationalization mechanism. And it's very, very deadly. And at the point you go from lab leak

1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:53.680
 to repurposed drugs, you can see that it's very deadly in a very direct way.

1:03:54.560 --> 1:04:02.720
 Yeah, I see this in my field with things like autonomous weapons systems. People in AI do

1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:08.720
 not talk about the use of AI in weapons systems. They kind of avoid the idea that AI is used in

1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:13.920
 the military. It's kind of funny. There's this kind of discomfort and they're like, they all

1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:20.000
 hurry like something scary happens and a bunch of sheep kind of like run away. That's what it looks

1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:26.880
 like. And I don't even know what to do about it. And then I feel this natural pull every time I

1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:32.240
 bring up autonomous weapons systems to go along with the sheep. There's a natural kind of pull

1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:38.240
 towards that direction because it's like, what can I do as one person? Now there's currently

1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:43.520
 nothing destructive happening with autonomous weapons systems. So we're like in the early days

1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:49.840
 of this race that in 10, 20 years might become a real problem. Now we're the discussion we're

1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:56.880
 having now, we're now facing the result of that in the space of viruses, like for many years

1:04:56.880 --> 1:05:04.160
 avoiding the conversations here. I don't know what to do that in the early days. But I think we

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:09.440
 have to, I guess, create institutions where people can stand out. People can stand out and like

1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:17.280
 basically be individual thinkers and break out into all kinds of spaces of ideas that allow us to

1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:22.720
 think freely, freedom of thought. And maybe that requires a decentralization of institutions.

1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:29.760
 Well, years ago, I came up with a concept called cultivated insecurity. And the idea is,

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:37.200
 let's just take the example of the average Joe, right? The average Joe has a job somewhere and

1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:45.680
 their mortgage, their medical insurance, their retirement, their connection with the economy

1:05:46.240 --> 1:05:51.600
 is to one degree or another dependent on their relationship with the employer.

1:05:51.600 --> 1:06:00.320
 That means that there is a strong incentive, especially in any industry where it's not easy to

1:06:00.320 --> 1:06:05.840
 move from one employer to the next, there's a strong incentive to stay in your employer's good

1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:11.760
 graces, right? So it creates a very top down dynamic, not only in terms of who gets to tell

1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:17.680
 other people what to do, but it really comes down to who gets to tell other people how to think.

1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:26.240
 So that's extremely dangerous. The way out of it is to cultivate security to the extent that

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:33.360
 somebody is in a position to go against the grain and have it not be a catastrophe for their family

1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:37.600
 and their ability to earn, you will see that behavior a lot more. So I would argue that some

1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:43.040
 of what you're talking about is just a simple predictable consequence of the concentration

1:06:43.040 --> 1:06:50.240
 of the sources of well being and that this is a solvable problem.

1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:55.120
 You got a chance to talk with Joe Rogan yesterday?

1:06:55.120 --> 1:06:55.760
 Yes, I did.

1:06:56.480 --> 1:07:02.800
 And I just saw the episode was released and Ivor Mekton is trending on Twitter.

1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:07.680
 Joe told me it was an incredible conversation. I look forward to listening to you today. Many

1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:13.520
 people have probably by the time this is released have already listened to it. I think it would be

1:07:13.520 --> 1:07:22.000
 interesting to discuss a postmortem. How do you feel how the conversation went? And maybe broadly,

1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:31.840
 how do you see the story as it's unfolding of Ivor Mekton from the origins from before COVID 19

1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:37.040
 through 2020 to today? I very much enjoyed talking to Joe and I'm

1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:44.880
 undescribably grateful that he would take the risk of such a discussion that he would,

1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:51.920
 as he described it, do an emergency podcast on the subject, which I think that was not an exaggeration.

1:07:51.920 --> 1:07:59.680
 This needed to happen for various reasons that he took us down the road of talking about

1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:06.080
 the censorship campaign against Ivor Mekton, which I find utterly shocking and talking about

1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:12.800
 the drug itself. And I should say we had Pierre Corey available. He came on the podcast as well.

1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:20.560
 He is, of course, the face of the FLCCCC, the frontline COVID 19 critical care alliance. These

1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:26.160
 are doctors who have innovated ways of treating COVID patients and they happened on Ivor Mekton

1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:33.520
 and have been using it. And I hesitate to use the word advocating for it because that's not

1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:38.640
 really the role of doctors or scientists, but they are advocating for it in the sense that there is

1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:45.440
 this pressure not to talk about its effectiveness for reasons that we can go into. So maybe step

1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:53.120
 back and say, what is Ivor Mekton and how much studies have been done to show its effectiveness?

1:08:53.120 --> 1:09:00.320
 So Ivor Mekton is an interesting drug. It was discovered in the 70s by a Japanese

1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:08.720
 scientist named Satoshi Omura. And he found it in soil near a Japanese golf course. So I would

1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:15.520
 just point out in passing that if we were to stop self silencing over the possibility that

1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:21.760
 Asians will be demonized over the possible lab leak in Wuhan and to recognize that actually the

1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:31.600
 natural course of the story has a likely lab leak in China. It has a unlikely hero in Japan.

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:41.280
 The story is naturally not a simple one. But in any case, Omura discovered this molecule. He

1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:50.080
 sent it to a friend who was at Merck, a scientist named Campbell. They won a Nobel Prize for the

1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:58.640
 discovery of the Ivor Mekton molecule in 2015. Its initial use was in treating parasitic infections.

1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:06.400
 It's very effective in treating the worm that causes river blindness, the pathogen that causes

1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:12.480
 elephantitis, scabies, the very effective anti parasite drug. It's extremely safe. It's on the

1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:18.240
 who's list of essential medications. It's safe for children. It has been administered something

1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:24.800
 like four billion times in the last four decades. It has been given away in the millions of doses

1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:31.280
 by Merck in Africa. People have been on it for long periods of time. And in fact,

1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:37.840
 one of the reasons that Africa may have had less severe impacts from COVID 19 is that Ivor Mekton

1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:43.200
 is widely used there to prevent parasites. And the drug appears to have a long lasting impact.

1:10:43.200 --> 1:10:48.560
 So it's an interesting molecule. It was discovered some time ago, apparently,

1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:55.120
 that it has antiviral properties. And so it was tested early in the COVID 19 pandemic to see if

1:10:55.120 --> 1:11:02.640
 it might work to treat humans with COVID. It turned out to have very promising evidence that it did

1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:08.800
 treat humans. It was tested in tissues. It was tested at a very high dosage, which confuses people.

1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:14.320
 They think that those of us who believe that Ivor Mekton might be useful in confronting this

1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:19.840
 disease are advocating those high doses, which is not the case. But in any case, there have been

1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:25.760
 quite a number of studies. A wonderful meta analysis was finally released. We had seen it in

1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:32.400
 preprint version, but it was finally peer reviewed and published this last week. It reveals that the

1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:37.280
 drug, as clinicians have been telling us, those who've been using it, it's highly effective at

1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:42.640
 treating people with the disease, especially if you get to them early. And it showed an 86%

1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:48.800
 effectiveness as a prophylactic to prevent people from contracting COVID. And that number, 86%,

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:55.600
 is high enough to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction if we wished to deploy it.

1:11:56.160 --> 1:12:03.760
 First of all, the meta analysis, is this the Ivor Mekton for COVID 19 real time meta analysis

1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:08.640
 of 60 studies? Or there's a bunch of meta analysis there, because I was really impressed by the

1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:13.200
 real time meta analysis that keeps getting updated. I don't know if it's the same kind.

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:20.960
 The one at IVMMeta.com? Well, I saw it. It's C19IvorMekton.com.

1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:26.400
 No, this is not that meta analysis. So that is, as you say, a living meta analysis where you can

1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:30.320
 watch as evidence. Which is super cool, by the way. It's really cool. And they've got some

1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:35.760
 really nice graphics that allow you to understand, well, what is the evidence? It's concentrated

1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:39.920
 around this level of effectiveness, et cetera. So anyway, it's great site, well worth paying

1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:45.760
 attention to. No, this is a meta analysis. I don't know any of the authors, but one.

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:54.880
 Second author is Tess Laurie of the Bird Group. Bird being a group of analysts and doctors in

1:12:54.880 --> 1:13:01.440
 Britain that is playing a role similar to the FLCCC here in the US. So anyway, this is a meta

1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:10.560
 analysis that Tess Laurie and others did of all of the available evidence. And it's quite compelling.

1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:15.040
 People, if people can look for it on my Twitter, I will put it up and people can find it there.

1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:23.200
 So what about dose here? In terms of safety, what do we understand about the kind of dose

1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:29.200
 required to have that level of effectiveness? And what do we understand about the safety of that

1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:36.880
 kind of dose? So let me just say I'm not a medical doctor. I'm a biologist. I'm on ivermectin in

1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:43.280
 lieu of vaccination. In terms of dosage, there is one reason for concern, which is that the most

1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:51.040
 effective dose for prophylaxis involves something like weekly administration. And that that is because

1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:56.800
 that is not a historical pattern of use for the drug. It is possible that there is some

1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:03.040
 long term implication of being on it weekly for a long period of time. There's not a strong

1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:08.560
 indication of that, the safety signal that we have over people using the drug over many years

1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:14.880
 and using it in high doses. In fact, Dr. Corey told me yesterday that there are cases in which

1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:20.480
 people have made calculation errors and taken a massive overdose of the drug and had no ill

1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:25.360
 effect. So anyway, there's lots of reasons to think the drug is comparatively safe, but no drug is

1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:31.840
 perfectly safe. And I do worry about the long term implications of taking it. I also think it's very

1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:42.960
 likely because the drug is administered in a dose something like let's say 15 milligrams for somebody

1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:49.680
 my size once a week after you've gone through the initial double dose that you take 48 hours

1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:57.120
 apart. It is apparent that if the amount of drug in your system is sufficient to be protective at

1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:01.600
 the end of the week, then it was probably far too high at the beginning of the week. So there's a

1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:08.240
 question about whether or not you could flatten out the intake so that the amount of ivermectin

1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:13.440
 goes down, but the protection remains. I have little doubt that that would be discovered if we looked

1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:21.200
 for it. But that said, it does seem to be quite safe, highly effective at preventing COVID. The

1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:28.800
 86% number is plenty high enough for us to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction in light of its R not

1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:36.560
 number of slightly more than two. And so why we are not using it as a bit of a mystery.

1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:44.640
 So even if everything you said now turns out to be not correct, it is nevertheless obvious that it's

1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:52.400
 sufficiently promising. It always has been in order to merit rigorous scientific exploration,

1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:58.640
 investigation, doing a lot of studies, and certainly not censoring the science or the

1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:06.560
 discussion of it. So before we talk about the various vaccines for COVID 19, I'd like to talk

1:16:06.560 --> 1:16:15.360
 to you about censorship. Given everything you're saying, why did YouTube and other places censor

1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:23.920
 discussion of ivermectin? Well, there's a question about why they say they did it,

1:16:23.920 --> 1:16:30.400
 and there's a question about why they actually did it. Now, it is worth mentioning that YouTube

1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:40.240
 is part of a consortium. It is partnered with Twitter, Facebook, Reuters, AP, Financial Times,

1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:48.560
 Washington Post, some other notable organizations, and that this group has appointed itself

1:16:48.560 --> 1:16:57.440
 the arbiter of truth. In effect, they have decided to control discussion ostensibly to

1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:02.960
 prevent the distribution of misinformation. Now, how have they chosen to do that? In this case,

1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:10.400
 they have chosen to simply utilize the recommendations of the who and the CDC and apply

1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:17.920
 them as if they are synonymous with scientific truth. Problem, even at their best, the who and

1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:25.440
 CDC are not scientific entities. They are entities that are about public health. Public health has

1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:31.440
 this, whether it's right or not, and I believe I disagree with it, but it has this

1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:41.040
 self assigned right to lie that comes from the fact that there is game theory that works against,

1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:48.160
 for example, a successful vaccination campaign, that if everybody else takes a vaccine and,

1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:53.760
 therefore, the herd becomes immune through vaccination and you decide not to take a vaccine,

1:17:53.760 --> 1:17:59.040
 then you benefit from the immunity of the herd without having taken the risk. So,

1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:04.800
 people who do best are the people who opt out. That's a hazard, and the who and CDC as public

1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:12.640
 health entities effectively oversimplify stories in order that that game theory does not cause

1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:18.240
 a predictable tragedy of the commons. With that said, once that right to lie exists,

1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:24.160
 then it finds out, it turns out to serve the interests of, for example, pharmaceutical

1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:28.800
 companies which have emergency use authorizations that require that they're not be a safe and

1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:34.640
 effective treatment and have immunity from liability for harms caused by their product.

1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:39.600
 So, that's a recipe for disaster, right? You don't need to be a sophisticated

1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:47.600
 thinker about complex systems to see the hazard of immunizing a company from the harm of its own

1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:53.360
 product at the same time that that product can only exist in the market if some other product

1:18:53.360 --> 1:19:00.560
 that works better somehow fails to be noticed. So, somehow YouTube is doing the bidding of Merck

1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:05.760
 and others. Whether it knows that that's what it's doing, I have no idea. I think this may

1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:11.040
 be another case of an autopilot that thinks it's doing the right thing because it's parroting the

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:16.880
 corrupt wisdom of the who and the CDC, but the who and the CDC have been wrong again and again

1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:23.920
 in this pandemic. And the irony here is that with YouTube coming after me, well, my channel has been

1:19:23.920 --> 1:19:30.560
 right where the who and CDC have been wrong consistently over the whole pandemic. So, how is

1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:36.240
 it that YouTube is censoring us because the who and CDC disagree with us when in fact in past

1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:41.680
 disagreements we've been right and they've been wrong? There's so much to talk about here. So,

1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:49.840
 I've heard this many times actually on the inside of YouTube and with colleagues that

1:19:49.840 --> 1:20:00.080
 I've talked with is they kind of in a very casual way say their job is simply to slow or prevent

1:20:00.080 --> 1:20:08.080
 the spread of misinformation. And they say like that's an easy thing to do. Like to know what is

1:20:08.080 --> 1:20:17.120
 true or not is an easy thing to do. And so, from the YouTube perspective, I think they basically

1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:26.560
 outsource of the task of knowing what is true or not to public institutions that on a basic

1:20:27.200 --> 1:20:37.440
 Google search claim to be the arbiters of truth. So, if you were YouTube who are exceptionally

1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:44.720
 profitable and exceptionally powerful in terms of controlling what people get to see or not,

1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:52.480
 what would you do? Would you take a stand, a public stand against the WHO who CDC?

1:20:53.920 --> 1:21:01.760
 Or would you instead say, you know what, let's open the dam and let any video on anything fly?

1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:09.360
 What do you do here? If you say you were put, if Brett Weinstein was put in charge of YouTube for

1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:16.640
 a month in this most critical of times or YouTube actually has incredible amounts of power to educate

1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:24.160
 the populace, to give power of knowledge to the populace such that they can reform institutions,

1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:29.760
 what would you do? How would you run YouTube? Well, unfortunately, or fortunately, this is

1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:37.040
 actually quite simple. The founders, the American founders settled on a counterintuitive formulation

1:21:37.040 --> 1:21:43.840
 that people should be free to say anything. They should be free from the government blocking them

1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:49.920
 from doing so. They did not imagine that in formulating that right that most of what was said

1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:54.800
 would be of high quality, nor did they imagine it would be free of harmful things. What they

1:21:54.800 --> 1:22:02.400
 correctly reasoned was that the benefit of leaving everything so it can be said exceeds the cost,

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:08.400
 which everyone understands to be substantial. What I would say is they could not have anticipated

1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:18.160
 the impact, the centrality of platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. If they had,

1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:23.600
 they would not have limited the First Amendment as they did. They clearly understood that the

1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:32.080
 power of the federal government was so great that it needed to be limited by granting explicitly the

1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:39.840
 right of citizens to say anything. In fact, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook may be more powerful

1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:44.000
 in this moment than the federal government of their worst nightmares could have been.

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:50.080
 The power that these entities have to control thought and to shift civilization is so great

1:22:50.080 --> 1:22:54.320
 that we need to have those same protections. It doesn't mean that harmful things won't be said,

1:22:54.320 --> 1:23:00.160
 but it means that nothing has changed about the cost benefit analysis of building the right to

1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:07.280
 censor. If I were running YouTube, the limit of what should be allowed is the limit of the law.

1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:13.120
 If what you are doing is legal, then it should not be YouTube's place to limit

1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:18.640
 what gets said or who gets to hear it. That is between speakers and audience. Will harm come

1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:24.640
 from that? Of course it will. Will net harm come from it? No, I don't believe it will. I believe

1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:29.680
 that allowing everything to be said does allow a process in which better ideas do come to the

1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:36.640
 fore and win out. You believe that in the end, when there's complete freedom to share ideas,

1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:43.120
 that truth will win out? What I've noticed, just as a brief side comment,

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:52.800
 that certain things become viral, regardless of their truth. I've noticed that things that are

1:23:52.800 --> 1:24:01.920
 dramatic or funny, things that become memes don't have to be grounded in truth. What worries me

1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:10.480
 there is that we basically maximize for drama versus maximize for truth in a system where

1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:17.840
 everything is free. That's worrying in the time of emergency. Well, yes, it's all worrying in

1:24:17.840 --> 1:24:22.800
 time of emergency, to be sure. But I want you to notice that what you've happened on is actually an

1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:32.160
 analog for a much deeper and older problem. We are not a blank slate, but we are the blankest

1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:37.280
 slate that nature has ever devised, and there's a reason for that. It's where our flexibility comes

1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:47.200
 from. We have, effectively, we are robots in which a large fraction of the cognitive capacity has

1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:52.960
 been or of the behavioral capacity has been offloaded to the software layer, which gets

1:24:52.960 --> 1:25:00.800
 written and rewritten over evolutionary time. That means, effectively, that much of what we are,

1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:05.840
 in fact, the important part of what we are, is housed in the cultural layer and the conscious

1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:14.320
 layer and not in the hardware hard coding layer. That layer is prone to make errors, right? And

1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:20.480
 anybody who's watched a child grow up knows that children make absurd errors all the time, right?

1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:25.760
 That's part of the process, as we were discussing earlier. It is also true that as you look across

1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:31.680
 a field of people discussing things, a lot of what is said is pure nonsense. It's garbage.

1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:40.640
 But the tendency of garbage to emerge and even to spread on the short term does not say that over

1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:49.760
 the long term, what sticks is not the valuable ideas. There is a high tendency for novelty to

1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:53.360
 be created in the cultural space, but there's also a high tendency for it to go extinct.

1:25:54.160 --> 1:25:58.560
 You have to keep that in mind. It's not like the genome, right? Everything is happening at a much

1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:04.480
 higher rate. Things are being created. They're being destroyed. I can't say that, obviously,

1:26:04.480 --> 1:26:10.640
 we've seen totalitarianism arise many times and it's very destructive each time it does. So,

1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:15.920
 it's not like, hey, freedom to come up with any idea you want hasn't produced a whole lot of

1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:22.960
 carnage, but the question is over time, does it produce more open, fairer, more decent societies?

1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:27.600
 And I believe that it does. I can't prove it, but that does seem to be the pattern.

1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:35.920
 I believe so as well. The thing is, in the short term, freedom of speech, absolute freedom of

1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:43.360
 speech can be quite destructive, but you nevertheless have to hold on to that, because in the long

1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:50.160
 term, I think you and I, I guess, are optimistic in the sense that good ideas will win out.

1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:57.520
 I don't know how strongly I believe that it will work, but I will say I haven't heard a better idea.

1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:04.160
 Yeah. I would also point out that there's something very significant in this question

1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:09.520
 of the hubris involved in imagining that you're going to improve the discussion by censoring,

1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:22.160
 which is the majority of concepts at the fringe are nonsense. That's automatic. But the heterodoxy

1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:27.920
 at the fringe, which is indistinguishable at the beginning from the nonsense ideas,

1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:34.720
 is the key to progress. So, if you decide, hey, the fringe is 99% garbage, let's just get rid

1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:39.920
 of it, right? Hey, that's a strong win. We're getting rid of 99% garbage for 1% something or

1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:44.160
 other. And the point is, yeah, but that 1% something or other is the key. You're throwing

1:27:44.160 --> 1:27:50.320
 out the key. And so that's what YouTube is doing. Frankly, I think at the point that it started

1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:56.000
 censoring my channel, you know, in the immediate aftermath of this major reversal of lab or for

1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:59.760
 lab leak, it should have looked at itself and said, well, what the hell are we doing? Who are we

1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:04.720
 censoring? We're censoring somebody who was just right, right, in a conflict with the very same

1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:09.200
 people on whose behalf we are now censoring, right? That should have caused them to wake up.

1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:15.840
 So, you said one approach, if you're on YouTube, is this basically let all videos go that do not

1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:20.560
 violate the law? Well, I should fix that. Okay. I believe that that is the basic principle.

1:28:20.560 --> 1:28:26.640
 Eric makes an excellent point about the distinction between ideas and personal attacks,

1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:32.480
 doxing, these other things. So, I agree there's no value in allowing people to destroy each other's

1:28:32.480 --> 1:28:38.400
 lives, even if there's a technical legal defense for it. Now, how you draw that line, I don't know.

1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:43.920
 But, you know, what I'm talking about is, yes, people should be free to traffic in bad ideas,

1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:49.280
 and they should be free to expose that the ideas are bad. And hopefully that process results in

1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:53.440
 better ideas winning out. Yeah, there's an interesting line between, you know,

1:28:53.440 --> 1:29:00.240
 like, ideas like the Earth is flat, which I believe you should not censor. And then,

1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:06.560
 like, you start to encroach on, like, personal attacks. So, not, you know, doxing, yes, but,

1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:11.440
 like, not even getting to that. Like, there's a certain point where it's like, that's no longer

1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:20.240
 ideas, that's more, that's somehow not productive, even if it's, it feels like believing the Earth

1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:26.640
 is flat, it's somehow productive. Because maybe there's a tiny percent chance it is. You know,

1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:33.360
 like, it just feels like personal attacks, it doesn't. Well, you know, it's, I'm torn on this

1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:38.240
 because there's assholes in this world, there's fraudulent people in this world. So, sometimes

1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:45.360
 personal attacks are useful to reveal that. But there's a line you can cross. Like, there's a

1:29:45.360 --> 1:29:50.640
 comedy where people make fun of others. I think that's amazing, that's very powerful,

1:29:50.640 --> 1:29:55.200
 and that's very useful, even if it's painful. But then there's like, once it gets to be,

1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:00.800
 yeah, there's a certain line, it's a gray area where you cross where it's no longer

1:30:01.760 --> 1:30:09.120
 in any possible world productive. And that's a really weird gray area for YouTube to operate in.

1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:14.400
 And it feels like it should be a crowdsourced thing where people vote on it. But then again,

1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:19.760
 do you trust the majority to vote on what is crossing the line or not? I mean, this is where,

1:30:20.880 --> 1:30:27.600
 this is really interesting on this particular, like the scientific aspect of this. Do you think

1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:36.880
 YouTube should take more of a stance? Not censoring, but to actually have scientists within YouTube,

1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:42.000
 having these kinds of discussions, and then be able to almost speak out in a transparent way.

1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:46.800
 This is what we're going to let this video stand. But here's all these other opinions,

1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:53.280
 almost like take a more active role in its recommendation system in trying to present

1:30:53.280 --> 1:30:59.600
 a full picture to you. Right now, they're not there. The recommender systems are not human

1:30:59.600 --> 1:31:05.600
 fine tuned. They're all based on how you click. And there's this clustering algorithms. They're

1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:10.880
 not taking an active role on giving you the full spectrum of ideas in the space of science.

1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:17.280
 They just censor or not. Well, at the moment, it's going to be pretty hard to compel me that

1:31:17.280 --> 1:31:24.880
 these people should be trusted with any sort of curation or comment on matters of evidence because

1:31:24.880 --> 1:31:30.720
 they have demonstrated that they are incapable of doing it well. You could make such an argument.

1:31:30.720 --> 1:31:36.480
 And I guess I'm open to the idea of institutions that would look something like YouTube that would

1:31:36.480 --> 1:31:42.160
 be capable of offering something valuable. And even just the fact of them literally curating

1:31:42.160 --> 1:31:48.800
 things and putting some videos next to others implies something. So yeah, there's a question

1:31:48.800 --> 1:31:55.040
 to be answered. But at the moment, no. At the moment, what it is doing is quite literally putting

1:31:55.040 --> 1:32:02.240
 not only individual humans in tremendous jeopardy by censoring discussion of useful tools and making

1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:08.960
 tools that are more hazardous than has been acknowledged seem safe. But it is also placing

1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:15.360
 humanity in danger of a permanent relationship with this pathogen. I cannot emphasize enough

1:32:15.360 --> 1:32:20.320
 how expensive that is. It's effectively incalculable if the relationship becomes permanent,

1:32:20.320 --> 1:32:25.280
 the number of people who will ultimately suffer and die from it is indefinitely large.

1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:32.560
 Yeah, there's currently the algorithm is very rabbit hole driven, meaning if you click on

1:32:33.600 --> 1:32:40.000
 flat earth videos, that's all you're going to be presented with. And you're not going to be

1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:44.080
 nicely presented with arguments against the flat earth. And the flip side of that,

1:32:46.560 --> 1:32:50.640
 if you watch like quantum mechanics videos or no, general relativity videos,

1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:54.000
 it's very rare you're going to get in a recommendation, have you considered the earth

1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:00.880
 as flat? And I think you should have both. Same with vaccine, videos that present the power and

1:33:00.880 --> 1:33:09.040
 incredible like biology, genetics, biology about the vaccine, you're rarely going to get videos

1:33:09.840 --> 1:33:17.200
 from well respected scientific minds presenting possible dangers of the vaccine. And the vice

1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:22.560
 of versus true as well, which is if you're looking at the dangers of the vaccine on YouTube,

1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:27.920
 you're not going to get the highest quality of videos recommended to you. And I'm not talking

1:33:27.920 --> 1:33:34.320
 about like manually inserted CDC videos that are like the most untrustworthy things you can possibly

1:33:34.320 --> 1:33:39.200
 watch about how everybody should take the vaccine. It's the safest thing ever. No, it's about

1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:44.400
 incredible. Again, MIT colleagues of mine, incredible biologists, virologists that I'll

1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:50.880
 talk about the details of how the mRNA vaccines work and all those kinds of things. I think

1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:58.640
 maybe this is me with the AI head on is I think the algorithm can fix a lot of this. And YouTube

1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:07.440
 should build better algorithms and trust that to a couple of complete freedom of speech to expand

1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:14.240
 the what people are able to think about, present always varied views, not balance in some artificial

1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:20.080
 way, hard coded way, but balance in a way that's crowdsourced. I think that's an algorithm problem

1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:27.680
 that can be solved because then you can delegate it to the algorithm as opposed to this hard code

1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:36.080
 censorship of basically creating artificial boundaries on what can and can't be discussed,

1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:42.400
 instead creating a full spectrum of exploration that can be done and trusting the intelligence of

1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:49.120
 people to do the exploration. Well, there's a lot there, I would say we have to keep in mind

1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:55.920
 that we're talking about a publicly held company with shareholders and obligations to them and

1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:02.880
 that that may make it impossible. And I remember many years ago back in the early days of Google,

1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:12.880
 I remember a sense of terror at the loss of general search. It used to be that Google,

1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:18.800
 if you searched, came up with the same thing for everyone and then it got personalized and for a

1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:23.440
 while it was possible to turn off the personalization, which was still not great because if everybody

1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:27.760
 else is looking at a personalized search and you can tune into one that isn't personalized,

1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:33.520
 that doesn't tell you why the world is sounding the way it is. But nonetheless,

1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:38.400
 it was at least an option and then that vanished. And the problem is, I think this is literally

1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:45.600
 deranging us that in effect, what you're describing is unthinkable. It is unthinkable

1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:52.000
 that in the face of a campaign to vaccinate people in order to reach herd immunity that

1:35:53.680 --> 1:36:02.000
 YouTube would give you videos on hazards of vaccines when this is how hazardous the vaccines are

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:08.080
 is an unsettled question. Why is it unthinkable? That doesn't make any sense from a company

1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:18.320
 perspective. If intelligent people in large amounts are open minded and are thinking through the

1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:27.360
 hazards and the benefits of a vaccine, a company should find the best videos to present what

1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:31.680
 people are thinking about. Well, let's come up with a hypothetical. Let's come up with a

1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:39.040
 very deadly disease for which there's a vaccine that is very safe, though not perfectly safe.

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:45.200
 And we are then faced with YouTube trying to figure out what to do for somebody searching

1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:51.360
 on vaccine safety. Suppose it is necessary in order to drive the pathogen to extinction,

1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:54.960
 something like smallpox, that people get on board with the vaccine.

1:36:54.960 --> 1:37:03.120
 But there's a tiny fringe of people who thinks that the vaccine is a mind control agent.

1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:12.400
 So should YouTube direct people to the only claims against this vaccine,

1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:20.880
 which is that it's a mind control agent, when in fact the vaccine is very safe,

1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:26.640
 whatever that means. If that were the actual configuration of the puzzle, then YouTube would

1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:34.320
 be doing active harm pointing you to this other video potentially. Now, yes, I would love to

1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:40.080
 live in a world where people are up to the challenge of sorting that out. But my basic

1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:46.320
 point would be, if it's an evidentiary question, and there is essentially no evidence that the

1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:50.640
 vaccine is a mind control agent and there's plenty of evidence that the vaccine is safe,

1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:55.280
 then, well, you look for this video, we're going to give you this one puts it on a par, right?

1:37:55.280 --> 1:38:01.680
 So for the mind that's tracking how much thought is there behind it's safe versus how much thought

1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:07.840
 is there behind it's a mind control agent will result in artificially elevating this. Now,

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:14.640
 in the current case, what we've seen is not this at all. We have seen evidence obscured in order

1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:23.520
 to create a false story about safety. And we saw the inverse with ivermectin. We saw a campaign

1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:30.000
 to portray the drug as more dangerous and less effective than the evidence clearly suggested

1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:35.520
 it was. So we're not talking about a comparable thing. But I guess my point is the algorithmic

1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:42.000
 solution that you point to creates a problem of its own, which is that it means that the way to get

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:46.720
 exposure is to generate something fringy. If you're the only thing on some fringe,

1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:52.640
 then suddenly YouTube would be recommending those things. And that's obviously a gameable system at

1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:58.160
 best. Yeah, but the solution to that, I know you're creating a thought experiment, maybe playing a

1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:03.840
 little bit of a devil's advocate. I think the solution to that is not to limit the algorithm

1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:08.880
 in the case of the super deadly virus. It's for the scientists to step up and become better

1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:15.360
 communicators, more charismatic, is fight the battle of ideas, sort of create better videos.

1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:22.000
 Like if the virus is truly deadly, you have a lot more ammunition, a lot more data,

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.280
 a lot more material to work with in terms of communicating with the public.

1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:33.200
 So be better at communicating and stop being, you have to start trusting the intelligence of

1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:37.600
 people and also being transparent and playing the game of the internet, which is like,

1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:44.080
 what is the internet hungry for? I believe authenticity. Stop looking like you're full of

1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:50.400
 shit. It's the scientific community. If there's any flaw that I currently see,

1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:55.120
 especially the people that are in public office that like Anthony Fauci, they look like they're

1:39:55.120 --> 1:40:00.800
 full of shit. And I know they're brilliant. Why don't they look more authentic? So they're losing

1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:06.560
 that game. And I think a lot of people observing this entire system now, younger scientists are

1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:13.280
 seeing this and saying, okay, if I want to continue being a scientist in the public eye,

1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:18.000
 and I want to be effective on my job, I'm going to have to be a lot more authentic.

1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.960
 So they're learning the lesson. This evolutionary system is working.

1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:27.040
 So there's just a younger generation of minds coming up that I think will do a much better job

1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:32.720
 in this battle of ideas that when the much more dangerous virus comes along,

1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:37.920
 they'll be able to be better communicators. At least that's the hope. The using the algorithm

1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:43.760
 to control that is, I feel like is a big problem. So you're going to have the same problem with a

1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:51.600
 deadly virus as with the current virus. If you let YouTube draw hard lines by the PR and the

1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:57.360
 marketing people versus the broad community of scientists. Well, in some sense, you're

1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:04.880
 suggesting something that's close kin to what I was saying about freedom of expression ultimately

1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:11.440
 provides an advantage to better ideas. So I'm in agreement, broadly speaking. But I would also

1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:16.720
 say there's probably some sort of, let's imagine the world that you propose where YouTube shows

1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:22.560
 you the alternative point of view. That has the problem that I suggest. But one thing you could

1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:28.640
 do is you could give us the tools to understand what we're looking at. You could give us, so first

1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:37.120
 of all, there's something, I think, myopic, solipsistic, narcissistic about an algorithm

1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:42.000
 that serves shareholders by showing you what you want to see rather than what you need to know.

1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:48.240
 That's the distinction is flattering you, playing to your blind spot is something that

1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:53.360
 algorithm will figure out, but it's not healthy for us all to have Google playing to our blind spot.

1:41:53.360 --> 1:42:01.520
 It's very, very dangerous. So what I really want is analytics that allow me or maybe options and

1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:08.400
 analytics, the options should allow me to see what alternative perspectives are being explored.

1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:13.520
 So here's the thing I'm searching and it leads me down this road. Let's say it's ivermectin.

1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:17.760
 I find all of this evidence that ivermectin works. I find all of these discussions and people

1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:23.600
 talk about various protocols and this and that. And then I could say, all right, what is the other

1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:30.960
 side? And I could see who is searching not as individuals, but what demographics are searching

1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:37.120
 alternatives. And maybe you could even combine it with something Reddit like where effectively,

1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:44.080
 let's say that there was a position that, I don't know, that a vaccine is a mind control device

1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:50.400
 and you could have a steelman this argument competition effectively. And the better answers

1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:54.960
 that steelman and as well as possible would rise to the top. And so you could read the top three

1:42:54.960 --> 1:43:02.240
 or four explanations about why this really credibly is a mind control product. And you can say, well,

1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:06.000
 that doesn't really add up. I can check these three things myself and they can't possibly be

1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:10.320
 right. Right. And you could dismiss it. And then as an argument that was credible, let's say

1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:17.680
 plate tectonics before that was an accepted concept, you'd say, wait a minute, there is evidence

1:43:18.320 --> 1:43:22.640
 for plate tectonics. Crazy as it sounds that the continents are floating around on liquid.

1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:29.280
 Actually, that's not so implausible. You know, we've got these subduction zones. We've got a geology

1:43:29.280 --> 1:43:33.360
 that is compatible. We've got puzzle piece continents that seem to fit together. Wow,

1:43:33.360 --> 1:43:38.080
 that's a surprising amount of evidence for that position. So I'm going to file some Bayesian

1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:41.760
 probability with it that's updated for the fact that actually the steelman argument is better

1:43:41.760 --> 1:43:46.720
 than I was expecting. Right. So I could imagine something like that where A, I would love the

1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:51.840
 search to be indifferent to who's searching. Right. The solipsistic thing is too dangerous.

1:43:51.840 --> 1:43:56.000
 So the search could be general. So we would all get a sense for what everybody else was seeing to.

1:43:56.880 --> 1:44:01.760
 And then some layer that didn't have anything to do with what YouTube points you to or not,

1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:12.080
 but allowed you to see the general pattern of adherence to searching for information and,

1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:15.920
 again, a layer in which those things could be defended so you could hear what a good argument

1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:21.760
 sounded like rather than just hear a caricatured argument. Yeah. And also reward people, creators

1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:28.800
 that have demonstrated like a track record of open mindedness and correctness as much as it

1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:39.520
 could be measured over a long term and sort of, I mean, a lot of this maps to incentivizing

1:44:40.400 --> 1:44:48.480
 good long term behavior, not immediate kind of dopamine rush kind of signals.

1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:58.400
 I think ultimately the algorithm on the individual level should optimize for personal growth,

1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:07.280
 long term happiness, just growth intellectually growth in terms of lifestyle personally and so

1:45:07.280 --> 1:45:13.360
 on as opposed to immediate. I think that's going to build a better site, not even just like truth,

1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:19.760
 because I think truth is a complicated thing. It's more just you growing as a person, exploring

1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:25.200
 in the space of ideas, changing your mind often, increasing the level to which you're open minded,

1:45:25.200 --> 1:45:31.280
 the knowledge base you're operating from, the willingness to empathize with others,

1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:35.440
 all those kinds of things the algorithm should optimize for that creating a better human at

1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:41.200
 the individual level that you're all I think that's a great business model, because the person

1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:49.040
 that's using this tool will then be happier with themselves for having used it, and it'll be a lifelong

1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:55.840
 quote unquote customer. I think it's a great business model to make a happy, open minded,

1:45:55.840 --> 1:46:01.520
 knowledgeable, better human being. It's a terrible business model under the current system.

1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:05.520
 What you want is to build the system in which it is a great business model.

1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:11.600
 Why is a terrible model? Because it will be decimated by those who play to the short term.

1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:17.200
 I don't think so. I mean, I think we're living it. We're living it.

1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:20.320
 Well, no, because if you have the alternative that presents itself,

1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:27.200
 it points out the emperor has no clothes. It points out that YouTube is operating in this way,

1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:30.640
 Twitter is operating in this way, Facebook is operating in this way.

1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:38.560
 How long term would you like the wisdom to prove that? Even though a week is better

1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:44.800
 when it's currently happening. Right. But the problem is, if a week loses out to an hour, right?

1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:49.520
 I don't think it loses out. It loses out in the short term.

1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:52.960
 That's my point. At least you're a great communicator and you basically say,

1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:58.160
 look, here's the metrics. A lot of it is how people actually feel.

1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:04.480
 This is what people experience with social media. They look back at the previous month and say,

1:47:06.160 --> 1:47:13.440
 I felt shitty in a lot of days because of social media. If you look back at the previous few weeks

1:47:13.440 --> 1:47:20.160
 and say, wow, I'm a better person because of that month happened, they immediately choose

1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:24.400
 the product that's going to lead to that. That's what love for products looks like.

1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:31.760
 If you love, a lot of people love their Tesla car or iPhone or beautiful design,

1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:36.400
 that's what love looks like. You look back, I'm a better person for having used this thing.

1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:40.240
 Well, you got to ask yourself the question though, if this is such a great business model,

1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:45.600
 why isn't it evolving? Why don't we see it? Honestly, it's competence.

1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:54.560
 It's like people are just, it's not easy to build new, it's not easy to build products, tools,

1:47:54.560 --> 1:48:00.000
 systems on new ideas. It's kind of a new idea. We've gone through this,

1:48:00.640 --> 1:48:06.160
 everything we're seeing now comes from the ideas of the initial birth of the internet.

1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:12.400
 There just needs to be new sets of tools that are incentivizing long term personal growth

1:48:12.400 --> 1:48:17.440
 and happiness. That's it. Right. But what we have is a market that doesn't favor this.

1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:25.760
 For one thing, we had an alternative to Facebook that looked, you owned your own data,

1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:33.200
 it wasn't exploitative and Facebook bought a huge interest in it and it died. Who do you know

1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:38.560
 who's on diaspora? The execution there was not good. Right. But it could have gotten better.

1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:44.640
 Right. I don't think that the argument that why hasn't somebody done it,

1:48:44.640 --> 1:48:49.840
 a good argument for it's not going to completely destroy all of Twitter and Facebook when somebody

1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:56.160
 does it or Twitter will catch up and pivot to the algorithm. This is not what I'm saying.

1:48:56.160 --> 1:49:01.120
 There's obviously great ideas that remain unexplored because nobody has gotten to the

1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:06.800
 foothill that would allow you to explore them. That's true. But an internet that was non predatory

1:49:06.800 --> 1:49:12.880
 is an obvious idea and many of us know that we want it and many of us have seen prototypes

1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:16.640
 of it and we don't move because there's no audience there. So the network effects

1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:23.840
 cause you to stay with the predatory internet. But let me just, I wasn't kidding about build

1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:30.960
 the system in which your idea is a great business plan. So in our upcoming book,

1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:35.040
 Heather and I in our last chapter explore something called the fourth frontier and fourth

1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:41.120
 frontier has to do with sort of a 2.0 version of civilization, which we freely admit we can't

1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:45.040
 tell you very much about. It's something that would have to be, we would have to prototype our

1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:49.600
 way there. We would have to effectively navigate our way there. But the result would be very much

1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:54.720
 like what you're describing. It would be something that effectively liberates humans

1:49:54.720 --> 1:50:01.440
 meaningfully and most importantly, it has to feel like growth without depending on growth.

1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:07.600
 In other words, human beings are creatures that like every other creature is effectively looking

1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:13.200
 for growth, right? We are looking for underexploited or unexploited opportunities. And when we find

1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:19.360
 them, our ancestors, for example, if they happen into a new valley that was unexplored by people,

1:50:19.920 --> 1:50:23.760
 their population would grow until it had carrying capacity. So there would be this great feeling

1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:27.840
 of there's abundance until you hit carrying capacity, which is inevitable. And then zero

1:50:27.840 --> 1:50:34.880
 some dynamics would set in. So in order for human beings to flourish long term, the way to get there

1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:40.880
 is to satisfy the desire for growth without hooking it to actual growth, which only moves and

1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:48.800
 fits and starts. And this is actually, I believe the key to avoiding these spasms of human tragedy

1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:54.640
 when in the absence of growth, people do something that causes their population to experience

1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:59.760
 growth, which is they go and make war on or commit genocide against some other population,

1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:06.000
 which is something we obviously have to stop. By the way, this is a hunter gatherers guide to

1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:11.840
 the 21st century coauthored with your wife, Heather, being released this September. I believe you

1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:17.120
 said you're going to do a little bit of a preview videos on each chapter leading up to the release.

1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:23.520
 So I'm looking forward to the last chapter as well as all the previous one. I have a few

1:51:23.520 --> 1:51:30.960
 questions on that. So you generally have faith to clarify that technology could be the thing

1:51:31.760 --> 1:51:39.520
 that empowers this kind of future? Well, if you just let technology evolve,

1:51:40.400 --> 1:51:48.160
 it's going to be our undoing, right? One of the things that I fault my libertarian friends for

1:51:48.160 --> 1:51:53.600
 is this faith that the market is going to find solutions without destroying us. And my sense is

1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:59.440
 I'm a very strong believer in markets, right? I believe in their power even above some market

1:51:59.440 --> 1:52:05.280
 fundamentalists. But what I don't believe is that they should be allowed to plot our course,

1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:11.440
 right? Markets are very good at figuring out how to do things. They are not good at all about

1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:16.480
 figuring out what we should do, right? What we should want. We have to tell markets what we want,

1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:23.280
 and then they can tell us how to do it best. And if we adopted that kind of pro market but

1:52:23.280 --> 1:52:27.920
 in a context where it's not steering, where human well being is actually the driver,

1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:34.640
 we can do remarkable things and the technology that emerges would naturally be enhancing of human

1:52:34.640 --> 1:52:41.040
 well being. Perfectly so, no, but overwhelmingly so. But at the moment, markets are finding our

1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:46.720
 every defective character and exploiting them and making huge profits and making us worse to each

1:52:46.720 --> 1:52:55.920
 other in the process. Before we leave COVID 19, let me ask you about a very difficult topic,

1:52:57.680 --> 1:53:07.760
 which is the vaccines. So I took the Pfizer vaccine, the two shots. You did not. You have

1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:17.920
 been taking ivermectin. So one of the arguments against the discussion of ivermectin is that

1:53:19.360 --> 1:53:26.720
 it prevents people from being fully willing to get the vaccine. How would you compare ivermectin

1:53:27.760 --> 1:53:34.480
 and the vaccine for COVID 19? All right. That's a good question. I would say, first of all,

1:53:34.480 --> 1:53:39.280
 there are some hazards with the vaccine that people need to be aware of. There are some things that

1:53:39.280 --> 1:53:45.360
 we cannot rule out and for which there is some evidence. The two that I think people should

1:53:45.360 --> 1:53:52.560
 be tracking is the possibility, some would say a likelihood that a vaccine of this nature,

1:53:53.520 --> 1:54:02.240
 that is to say very narrowly focused on a single antigen, is an evolutionary pressure

1:54:02.240 --> 1:54:07.200
 that will drive the emergence of variants that will escape the protection that comes from the

1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:15.120
 vaccine. So this is a hazard. It is a particular hazard in light of the fact that these vaccines

1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:21.360
 have a substantial number of breakthrough cases. So one danger is that a person who has been

1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:29.600
 vaccinated will shed viruses that are specifically less visible or invisible to the immunity created

1:54:29.600 --> 1:54:37.280
 by the vaccines. So we may be creating the next pandemic by applying the pressure of vaccines

1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:42.160
 at a point that it doesn't make sense to. The other danger has to do with something

1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:47.120
 called antibody dependent enhancement, which is something that we see in certain diseases

1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:53.200
 like dengue fever. You may know that dengue one gets a case and then their second case is much

1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:58.960
 more devastating. So break bone fever is when you get your second case of dengue and dengue

1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:05.600
 effectively utilizes the immune response that is produced by prior exposure to attack the body

1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:10.720
 in ways that it is incapable of doing before exposure. So this is apparently, this pattern

1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:17.680
 has apparently blocked past efforts to make vaccines against coronaviruses, whether it

1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:22.160
 will happen here or not. It is still too early to say, but before we even get to the question

1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:29.120
 of harm done to individuals by these vaccines, we have to ask about what the overall impact is

1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:33.680
 going to be. And it's not clear in the way people think it is that if we vaccinate enough people,

1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:38.560
 the pandemic will end. It could be that we vaccinate people and make the pandemic worse.

1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:43.120
 And while nobody can say for sure that that's where we're headed, it is at least something to

1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:49.280
 be aware of. So don't vaccines usually create that kind of evolutionary pressure to create

1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:58.000
 more deadlier different strains of the virus? So is there something particular with these mRNA

1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:03.440
 vaccines that's uniquely dangerous in this regard? Well, it's not even just the mRNA vaccines. The

1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:09.840
 mRNA vaccines and the adeno vector DNA vaccine all share the same vulnerability, which is they are

1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:16.080
 very narrowly focused on one subunit of the spike protein. So that is a very concentrated

1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:22.400
 evolutionary signal. We are also deploying it in mid pandemic, and it takes time for immunity

1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:30.080
 to develop. So part of the problem here, if you inoculated a population before encounter with

1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:36.400
 a pathogen, then there might be substantially enough immunity to prevent this phenomenon from

1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:42.480
 happening. But in this case, we are inoculating people as they are encountering those who are

1:56:42.480 --> 1:56:48.400
 sick with the disease. And what that means is the disease is now faced with a lot of opportunities

1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:54.640
 to effectively, evolutionarily practice escape strategies. So one thing is the timing. The

1:56:54.640 --> 1:56:59.520
 other thing is the narrow focus. Now, in a traditional vaccine, you would typically not have

1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:05.360
 one antigen, right? You would have basically a virus full of antigens, and the immune system

1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:11.440
 would therefore produce a broader response. So that is the case for people who have had COVID,

1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:15.360
 right? They have an immunity that is broader because it wasn't so focused on one part of the

1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:20.960
 spike protein. So anyway, there is something unique here. So these platforms create that

1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:26.480
 special hazard. They also have components that we haven't used before in people. So for example,

1:57:26.480 --> 1:57:33.840
 the lipid nanoparticles that coat the RNAs are distributing themselves around the body in a way

1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:41.520
 that will have unknown consequences. So anyway, there's reason for concern. Is it possible for

1:57:41.520 --> 1:57:49.440
 you to steal man the argument that everybody should get vaccinated? Of course. The argument that

1:57:49.440 --> 1:57:56.480
 everybody should get vaccinated is that nothing is perfectly safe. Phase three trials showed

1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:03.680
 good safety for the vaccines. Now, that may or may not be actually true, but what we saw suggested

1:58:03.680 --> 1:58:10.320
 high degree of efficacy and a high degree of safety for the vaccines that inoculating people

1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:18.080
 quickly and therefore dropping the landscape of available victims for the pathogen to a very low

1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:23.680
 number so that herd immunity drives it to extinction requires us all to take our share of the risk

1:58:23.680 --> 1:58:30.960
 and that because driving it to extinction should be our highest priority that really

1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:37.760
 people shouldn't think too much about the various nuances because overwhelmingly fewer people will

1:58:37.760 --> 1:58:43.360
 die if the population is vaccinated from the vaccine than will die from COVID if they're not

1:58:43.360 --> 1:58:48.960
 vaccinated. And with the vaccine as it grows being deployed, that is a quite a likely scenario

1:58:48.960 --> 1:58:55.760
 that everything, you know, the virus will fade away in the following sense that the probability

1:58:55.760 --> 1:59:04.320
 that a more dangerous strain will be created is nonzero, but it's not 50%. It's something smaller.

1:59:04.320 --> 1:59:08.960
 And so the most like, well, I don't know, maybe you disagree with that, but the scenario we're

1:59:08.960 --> 1:59:14.560
 most likely to see now that the vaccine is here is that the virus is not going to be

1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:20.560
 most likely to see now that the vaccine is here is that the virus will fade away.

1:59:21.520 --> 1:59:25.600
 First of all, I don't believe that the probability of creating a worse pandemic is

1:59:25.600 --> 1:59:31.600
 low enough to discount. I think the probability is fairly high. And frankly, we are seeing a wave

1:59:31.600 --> 1:59:38.640
 of variants that we will have to do a careful analysis to figure out what exactly that has

1:59:38.640 --> 1:59:42.640
 to do with campaigns of vaccination where they have been, where they haven't been, where the

1:59:42.640 --> 1:59:46.880
 variants emerged from. But I believe that what we are seeing is a disturbing pattern

1:59:46.880 --> 1:59:51.680
 that reflects that those who were advising caution may well have been right.

1:59:51.680 --> 1:59:55.120
 The data here, by the way, and the small tangent is terrible.

1:59:55.120 --> 1:59:59.520
 Terrible. Right. And why is it terrible is another question, right?

1:59:59.520 --> 2:00:01.440
 This is where I started getting angry. Yes.

2:00:01.440 --> 2:00:07.040
 It's like, there's an obvious opportunity for exceptionally good data, for exceptionally

2:00:07.040 --> 2:00:13.120
 rigorous, even the website for self reporting side effects for, not side effects, but negative

2:00:13.120 --> 2:00:14.320
 effects. Adverse events.

2:00:14.320 --> 2:00:21.440
 Adverse events, sorry, for the vaccine. There's many things I could say from both the study

2:00:21.440 --> 2:00:31.440
 perspective. But mostly, let me just put on my hat of HTML and web design. It's like the

2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:36.080
 worst website. It makes it so unpleasant to report. It makes it so unclear what you're

2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:40.480
 reporting. If somebody actually has serious effects, like if you have very mild effects,

2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:46.240
 what are the incentives for you to even use that crappy website with many pages and forms

2:00:46.240 --> 2:00:50.640
 that don't make any sense? If you have adverse effects, what are the incentives for you to

2:00:50.640 --> 2:00:56.240
 use that website? What is the trust that you have that this information will be used?

2:00:56.240 --> 2:01:01.040
 Well, all those kinds of things. And the data about who's getting vaccinated,

2:01:01.040 --> 2:01:07.600
 anonymized data about who's getting vaccinated, where, when, with what vaccine, coupled with

2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:12.480
 the adverse effects, all of that we should be collecting. Instead, we're completely not.

2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:18.560
 We're doing it in a crappy way. And using that crappy data to make conclusions that you then

2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:25.520
 twist, you're basically collecting in a way that can arrive at whatever conclusions you want.

2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:32.080
 And the data is being collected by the institutions, by governments. And so therefore, it's obviously

2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:36.480
 they're going to try to construct any kind of narratives they want based on this crappy data.

2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:41.920
 It reminds me of much of psychology, the field that I love, but is flawed and many fundamental

2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:48.160
 ways. So rent over, but coupled with the dangers that you're speaking to, we don't have even the

2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:57.600
 data to understand the dangers. Yeah, I'm going to pick up on your rant and say we, estimates of

2:01:57.600 --> 2:02:06.560
 the degree of underreporting in VAERS are that it is 10% of the real to 100% and that's the

2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:11.200
 system for reporting. Yeah, the VAERS system is the system for reporting adverse events. So

2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:21.120
 in the US, we have above 5,000 unexpected deaths that seem in time to be associated with vaccination.

2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:29.360
 That is an undercount almost certainly. And by a large factor, we don't know how large I've seen

2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:38.480
 estimates 25,000 dead in the US alone. Now, you can make the argument that, okay, that's a large

2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:44.720
 number, but the necessity of immunizing the population to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction

2:02:45.360 --> 2:02:50.000
 is such that it's an acceptable number. But I would point out that that actually does not

2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:54.240
 make any sense. And the reason it doesn't make any sense is actually there are several reasons.

2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:59.840
 One, if that was really your point that, yes, many, many people are going to die,

2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:05.920
 but many more will die if we don't do this. Were that your approach, you would not be

2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:12.080
 inoculating people who had had COVID 19, which is a large population. There's no reason to expose

2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:17.520
 those people to danger. Their risk of adverse events in the case that they have them is greater.

2:03:18.160 --> 2:03:22.720
 So there's no reason that we would be allowing those people to face a risk of death if this was

2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:29.600
 really about an acceptable number of deaths arising out of this set of vaccines. I would also

2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:36.160
 point out there's something incredibly bizarre. And I would, I struggle to find language that is

2:03:36.160 --> 2:03:45.360
 strong enough for the horror of vaccinating children in this case, because children suffer a

2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:50.560
 greater risk of long term effects because they are going to live longer. And because this is

2:03:50.560 --> 2:03:54.880
 earlier in their development, therefore it impacts systems that are still forming,

2:03:54.880 --> 2:04:02.560
 and they tolerate COVID well. And so the benefit to them is very small. And so the only argument

2:04:03.280 --> 2:04:07.440
 for doing this is that they may cryptically be carrying more COVID than we think,

2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:11.760
 and therefore they may be integral to the way the virus spreads to the population.

2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:15.520
 But if that's the reason that we are inoculating children, and there has been some revision in

2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:20.000
 the last day or two about the recommendation on this because of the adverse events that have

2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:25.040
 shown up in children, but to the extent that we were vaccinating children, we were doing it

2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:31.920
 to protect old, infirm people who are the most likely to succumb to COVID 19.

2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:40.000
 What society puts children in danger, robbs children of life to save old,

2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:45.840
 infirm people? That's upside down. So there's something about the way we are going about

2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:53.360
 vaccinating, who we are vaccinating, what dangers we are pretending don't exist, that suggests that

2:04:53.360 --> 2:04:59.600
 to some set of people, vaccinating people is a good in and of itself, that that is the objective

2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:04.560
 of the exercise, not herd immunity. And the last thing, sorry, I don't want to prevent you from

2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:09.040
 jumping in here, but the second reason, in addition to the fact that we're exposing people to danger

2:05:09.040 --> 2:05:11.680
 that we should not be exposing them to.

2:05:11.680 --> 2:05:17.360
 By the way, as a tiny tangent, another huge part of this soup that should have been part of it,

2:05:17.360 --> 2:05:23.920
 that's an incredible solution, is large scale testing. But that might be another couple of

2:05:23.920 --> 2:05:29.360
 hour conversation, but there's these solutions that are obvious, that were available from the

2:05:29.360 --> 2:05:36.720
 very beginning. So you could argue that Iverrectin is not that obvious, but maybe the whole point

2:05:36.720 --> 2:05:43.840
 is you have aggressive, very fast research that leads to meta analysis and then large scale

2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:51.040
 production and deployment. Okay, at least that possibility should be seriously considered,

2:05:51.040 --> 2:05:56.800
 coupled with a serious consideration of large scale deployment of testing, at home testing,

2:05:56.800 --> 2:06:07.760
 that could have accelerated the speed at which we reached that herd immunity. But I don't even want to...

2:06:08.480 --> 2:06:13.920
 Well, let me just say, I am also completely shocked that we did not get on high quality

2:06:13.920 --> 2:06:19.760
 testing early and that we are still suffering from this even now, because just the simple

2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:25.040
 ability to track where the virus moves between people would tell us a lot about its mode of

2:06:25.040 --> 2:06:31.040
 transmission, which would allow us to protect ourselves better. Instead, that information was

2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:34.960
 hard won and for no good reason. So I also find this mysterious.

2:06:35.760 --> 2:06:43.840
 You've spoken with Eric Weinstein, your brother, on his podcast, The Portal, about the ideas that

2:06:43.840 --> 2:06:48.240
 eventually led to the paper you published titled, The Reserved Capacity Hypothesis.

2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:59.040
 I think first, can you explain this paper and the ideas that led up to it?

2:06:59.040 --> 2:07:07.760
 Sure. Easier to explain the conclusion of the paper. There's a question about why a creature

2:07:08.480 --> 2:07:15.680
 that can replace its cells with new cells grows feeble and inefficient with age. We call that

2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:24.400
 process, which is otherwise called aging. We call it senescence. And senescence in this paper,

2:07:24.400 --> 2:07:31.200
 it is hypothesized, is the unavoidable downside of a cancer prevention

2:07:32.880 --> 2:07:40.640
 feature of our bodies, that each cell has a limit on the number of times it can divide.

2:07:40.640 --> 2:07:44.560
 There are a few cells in the body that are exceptional, but most of our cells can only

2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:48.880
 divide a limited number of times. That's called the Hayflick limit. And the Hayflick limit

2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:56.720
 reduces the ability of the organism to replace tissues. It therefore

2:07:56.720 --> 2:08:03.680
 results in a failure over time of maintenance and repair. And that explains why we become

2:08:03.680 --> 2:08:10.720
 decrepit as we grow old. The question was, why would that be, especially in light of the fact

2:08:10.720 --> 2:08:17.600
 that the mechanism that seems to limit the ability of cells to reproduce is something

2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:24.720
 called a telomere. Telomere is not a gene, but it's a DNA sequence at the ends of our chromosomes

2:08:24.720 --> 2:08:29.360
 that is just simply repetitive. And the number of repeats functions like a counter.

2:08:30.080 --> 2:08:34.720
 So there's a number of repeats that you have after development is finished. And then each

2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:39.040
 time the cell divides, a little bit of telomere is lost. And at the point that the telomere becomes

2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:44.480
 critically short, the cell stops dividing even though it still has the capacity to do so.

2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:48.880
 It stops dividing and it starts transcribing different genes than it did when it had more

2:08:48.880 --> 2:08:56.160
 telomere. So what my work did was it looked at the fact that the telomeric shortening was being

2:08:56.160 --> 2:09:02.080
 studied by two different groups. It was being studied by people who were interested in counteracting

2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:07.120
 the aging process. And it was being studied in exactly the opposite fashion by people who were

2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:12.720
 interested in tumorogenesis and cancer. The thought being, because it was true that when

2:09:12.720 --> 2:09:18.080
 one looked into tumors, they always had telomerase active. That's the enzyme that lengthens our

2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:25.040
 telomeres. So those folks were interested in bringing about a halt to the lengthening of

2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:30.400
 telomeres in order to counteract cancer. And the folks who were studying the senescence process

2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:36.000
 were interested in lengthening telomeres in order to generate greater repair capacity.

2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:43.760
 And my point was evolutionarily speaking, this looks like a pleiotropic effect that the

2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:52.480
 genes which create the tendency of the cells to be limited in their capacity to replace themselves

2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:59.120
 are providing a benefit in youth, which is that we are largely free of tumors and cancer

2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:04.080
 at the inevitable late life cost that we grow feeble and inefficient and eventually die.

2:10:04.080 --> 2:10:11.760
 And that matches a very old hypothesis in evolutionary theory by somebody I was fortunate

2:10:11.760 --> 2:10:17.440
 enough to know, George Williams, one of the great 20th century evolutionists who argued

2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:23.600
 that senescence would have to be caused by pleiotropic genes that cause early life benefits

2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:29.280
 at unavoidable late life costs. And although this isn't the exact nature of the system he

2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:35.200
 predicted, it matches what he was expecting in many regards to a shocking degree.

2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:42.800
 That said, the focus of the paper is about the, let me just read the abstract.

2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:48.400
 We observed that captive rodent breeding protocols designed at the end of the abstract.

2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:52.960
 We observed that captive rodent breeding protocols designed to increase reproductive

2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:58.640
 output simultaneously exert strong selection against reproductive senescence and virtually

2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:04.960
 eliminate selection that would otherwise favor tumor suppression. This appears to have greatly

2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:10.560
 elongated the telomeres of laboratory mice where their telomeric failsafe effectively disabled.

2:11:10.560 --> 2:11:14.480
 These animals are unreliable models of normal senescence and tumor formation.

2:11:15.120 --> 2:11:20.880
 So basically using these mice is not going to lead to the right kinds of conclusions.

2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:27.600
 Safety tests employing these animals likely overestimate cancer risks and underestimate

2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:35.760
 tissue damage and consequent accelerated senescence. So I think, especially with your

2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:44.080
 discussion with Eric, the conclusion of this paper has to do with the fact that we shouldn't be

2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:53.360
 using these mice to test the safety or to make conclusions about cancer or senescence. Is that

2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:58.880
 the basic takeaway? Basically saying that the length of these telomeres is an important variable

2:11:58.880 --> 2:12:05.600
 to consider. Well, let's put it this way. I think there was a reason that the world of scientists

2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:14.320
 who was working on telomeres did not spot the pleiotropic relationship that was the key argument

2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:20.720
 in my paper. The reason they didn't spot it was that there was a result that everybody knew which

2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:28.080
 seemed inconsistent. The result was that mice have very long telomeres, but they do not have

2:12:28.080 --> 2:12:34.400
 very long lives. Now, we can talk about what the actual meaning of don't have very long lives is,

2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:41.680
 but in the end, I was confronted with a hypothesis that would explain a great many features of the

2:12:41.680 --> 2:12:47.120
 way mammals and indeed vertebrates age, but it was inconsistent with one result. And at first,

2:12:47.120 --> 2:12:51.600
 I thought maybe there's something wrong with the result. Maybe this is one of these cases where

2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:57.520
 the result was achieved once through some bad protocol and everybody else was repeating it.

2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:01.920
 Didn't turn out to be the case. Many laboratories had established that mice had ultra long telomeres.

2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:08.880
 And so I began to wonder whether or not there was something about the breeding protocols

2:13:09.440 --> 2:13:14.880
 that generated these mice. And what that would predict is that the mice that have long telomeres

2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:22.000
 would be laboratory mice and that wild mice would not. And Carol Greider, who agreed to collaborate

2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:29.280
 with me, tested that hypothesis and showed that it was indeed true that wild derived mice or at

2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:33.600
 least mice that had been in captivity for a much shorter period of time did not have ultra long

2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:41.760
 telomeres. Now, what this implied though, as you read, is that our breeding protocols generate

2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:46.320
 lengthening of telomeres. And the implication of that is that the animals that have these very

2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:53.600
 long telomeres will be hyper prone to create tumors. They will be extremely resistant to

2:13:53.600 --> 2:13:59.760
 toxins because they have effectively an infinite capacity to replace any damaged tissue. And so

2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:07.360
 ironically, if you give one of these ultra long telomere lab mice a toxin, if the toxin doesn't

2:14:07.360 --> 2:14:13.440
 outright kill it, it may actually increase its lifespan because it functions as a kind of chemotherapy.

2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:19.520
 So the reason that chemotherapy works is that dividing cells are more vulnerable than cells

2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:26.080
 that are not dividing. And so if this mouse has effectively had its cancer protection turned off

2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:31.360
 and it has cells dividing too rapidly and you give it a toxin, you will slow down its tumors

2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:36.560
 faster than you harm its other tissues. And so you'll get a paradoxical result that actually

2:14:36.560 --> 2:14:43.040
 some drug that's toxic seems to benefit the mouse. Now, I don't think that that was understood

2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:48.800
 before I published my paper. Now I'm pretty sure it has to be. And the problem is that this actually

2:14:48.800 --> 2:14:56.080
 is a system that serves pharmaceutical companies that have the difficult job of bringing compounds

2:14:56.080 --> 2:15:04.160
 to market, many of which will be toxic, maybe all of them will be toxic. And these mice predispose

2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:10.480
 our system to declare these toxic compounds safe. And in fact, I believe we've seen the errors that

2:15:10.480 --> 2:15:15.840
 result from using these mice a number of times, most famously with Vioxx, which turned out to do

2:15:15.840 --> 2:15:22.240
 conspicuous heart damage. Why do you think this paper on this idea has not gotten significant

2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:31.280
 traction? Well, my collaborator, Carol Greider, said something to me that rings in my ears to this

2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:37.520
 day. She initially, after she showed that laboratory mice have anomalously long telomeres and that

2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:42.400
 wild mice don't have long telomeres, I asked her where she was going to publish that result so that

2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:48.640
 I could cite it in my paper. And she said that she was going to keep the result in house rather than

2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:55.760
 publish it. And at the time, I was a young graduate student, I didn't really understand what she was

2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:04.000
 saying. But in some sense, the knowledge that a model organism is broken in a way that creates

2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:10.000
 the likelihood that certain results will be reliably generatable, you can publish a paper and make a

2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:14.960
 big splash with such a thing, or you can exploit the fact that you know how those models will

2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:21.520
 misbehave and other people don't. So there's a question, if somebody is motivated cynically,

2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:26.720
 and what they want to do is appear to have deeper insight into biology because they predict things

2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:32.960
 better than others do, knowing where the flaw is so that your predictions come out true is

2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:39.440
 advantageous. At the same time, I can't help but imagine that the pharmaceutical industry,

2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:46.000
 when it figured out that the mice were predisposed to suggest that drugs were safe, didn't leap to

2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:51.840
 leap to fix the problem, because in some sense, it was the perfect cover for the difficult job of

2:16:52.800 --> 2:16:58.000
 bringing drugs to market and then discovering their actual toxicity profile, right? This made

2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:02.640
 things look safer than they were. And I believe a lot of profits have likely been generated downstream.

2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:10.640
 So to kind of play devil's advocate, it's also possible that this particular the length of

2:17:10.640 --> 2:17:15.280
 the telomeres is not a strong variable for the conclusions for the drug development and for

2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:20.720
 the conclusions that Carol and others have been studying. Is it possible for that to be the case?

2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:29.360
 So one reason she and others could be ignoring this is because it's not a strong variable.

2:17:29.360 --> 2:17:33.440
 Well, I don't believe so. And in fact, at the point that I went to publish my paper,

2:17:34.080 --> 2:17:39.120
 Carol published her result. She did so in a way that did not make a huge splash.

2:17:39.120 --> 2:17:49.920
 I apologize if I don't know how. What was the emphasis of her publication of that paper? Was

2:17:49.920 --> 2:17:54.640
 it purely just kind of showing data? Or was there more? Because in your paper, there's a kind of

2:17:54.640 --> 2:18:02.000
 more of a philosophical statement as well. Well, my paper was motivated by interest in the evolutionary

2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:08.160
 dynamics around senescence. I wasn't pursuing grants or anything like that. I was just working

2:18:08.160 --> 2:18:14.800
 on a puzzle I thought was interesting. Carol has, of course, gone on to win a Nobel Prize for her

2:18:15.440 --> 2:18:20.080
 co discovery with Elizabeth Greider of telomerase, the enzyme that lengthens telomeres.

2:18:21.600 --> 2:18:27.680
 But anyway, she's a heavy hitter in the academic world. I don't know exactly what her purpose was.

2:18:27.680 --> 2:18:31.680
 I do know that she told me she wasn't planning to publish. And I do know that I discovered that

2:18:31.680 --> 2:18:37.200
 she was in the process of publishing very late. And when I asked her to send me the paper to see

2:18:37.200 --> 2:18:44.320
 whether or not she had put evidence in it that the hypothesis had come from me, she grudgingly

2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:51.600
 sent it to me. And my name was nowhere mentioned. And she broke contact at that point. What it is

2:18:51.600 --> 2:18:55.760
 that motivated her, I don't know. But I don't think it can possibly be that this result is

2:18:55.760 --> 2:19:02.320
 unimportant. The fact is, the reason I called her in the first place and established contact that

2:19:02.320 --> 2:19:07.440
 generated our collaboration was that she was a leading light in the field of

2:19:07.440 --> 2:19:14.000
 telomeric studies. And because of that, this question about whether the model organisms

2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:20.240
 are distorting the understanding of the functioning of telomeres is central.

2:19:20.880 --> 2:19:27.600
 Do you feel like you've been, as a young graduate student, do you think Carol or do you think the

2:19:27.600 --> 2:19:31.200
 scientific community broadly screwed you over in some way?

2:19:31.200 --> 2:19:36.640
 You know, I don't think of it in those terms, probably partly because it's not productive.

2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:44.480
 But I have a complex relationship with this story. On the one hand, I'm livid with Carol

2:19:44.480 --> 2:19:49.920
 Greider for what she did. She absolutely pretended that I didn't exist in this story.

2:19:49.920 --> 2:19:54.560
 And I don't think I was a threat to her. My interest was as an evolutionary biologist,

2:19:54.560 --> 2:19:59.440
 I had made an evolutionary contribution. She had tested a hypothesis. And frankly,

2:19:59.440 --> 2:20:03.680
 I think it would have been better for her if she had acknowledged what I had done.

2:20:03.680 --> 2:20:10.400
 I think it would have enhanced her work. And you know, I was, let's put it this way,

2:20:10.400 --> 2:20:14.240
 when I watched her Nobel lecture, and I should say there's been a lot of confusion about this

2:20:14.240 --> 2:20:20.080
 Nobel stuff, I've never said that I should have gotten a Nobel Prize. People have misportrayed that.

2:20:20.080 --> 2:20:30.080
 My in listening to her lecture, I had one of the most bizarre emotional experiences of my life,

2:20:30.080 --> 2:20:38.000
 because she presented the work that resulted from my hypothesis. She presented it as she had in her

2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:46.240
 paper with no acknowledgement of where it had come from. And she had, in fact, portrayed the

2:20:46.240 --> 2:20:53.040
 distortion of the telomeres as if it were a lucky fact, because it allowed testing hypotheses

2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:59.600
 that would otherwise not be testable. You have to understand, as a young scientist,

2:21:00.560 --> 2:21:08.000
 to watch work that you have done presented in what's surely the most important lecture of her

2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:18.480
 career. It's thrilling. It was thrilling to see her figures projected on the screen there,

2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:23.040
 to have been part of work that was important enough for that felt great. And of course,

2:21:23.040 --> 2:21:29.680
 to be erased from the story felt absolutely terrible. So anyway, that's sort of where I am

2:21:29.680 --> 2:21:41.200
 with it. My sense is, what I'm really troubled by in the story is the fact that as far as I know,

2:21:41.760 --> 2:21:48.000
 the flaw with the mice has not been addressed. And actually, Eric did some looking into this. He

2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:53.680
 tried to establish by calling the Jax lab and trying to ascertain what had happened with the

2:21:53.680 --> 2:21:58.640
 colonies, whether any change in protocol had occurred. And he couldn't get anywhere. There

2:21:58.640 --> 2:22:05.360
 was seemingly no awareness that it was even an issue. So I'm very troubled by the fact that as

2:22:05.360 --> 2:22:11.840
 a father, for example, I'm in no position to protect my family from the hazard that I believe

2:22:11.840 --> 2:22:17.200
 lurks in our medicine cabinets. Even though I'm aware of where the hazard comes from,

2:22:17.200 --> 2:22:21.360
 it doesn't tell me anything useful about which of these drugs will turn out to do damage if that

2:22:21.360 --> 2:22:27.520
 is ultimately tested. And that's a very frustrating position to be in. On the other hand, there's

2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:32.560
 a part of me that's even still grateful to Carol for taking my call. She didn't have to take my

2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:36.480
 call and talk to some young graduate student who had some evolutionary idea that wasn't

2:22:37.840 --> 2:22:43.600
 in her wheelhouse specifically. And yet she did. And for a while, she was a good collaborator.

2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:58.560
 So can I have to proceed carefully here? It's a complicated topic. She took the call and you're

2:22:58.560 --> 2:23:08.080
 saying that she basically erased credit pretending you didn't exist in a certain sense.

2:23:08.080 --> 2:23:19.600
 Let me phrase it this way. As a research scientist at MIT, I've had especially just

2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:26.880
 part of a large set of collaborations. I've had a lot of students come to me

2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:33.520
 and talk to me about ideas, perhaps less interesting than what we're discussing here

2:23:33.520 --> 2:23:40.640
 in the space of AI that I've been thinking about anyway. In general, everything I'm doing with

2:23:40.640 --> 2:23:50.240
 robotics, people have told me a bunch of ideas that I'm already thinking about. The point is

2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:55.440
 taking that idea, see, this is different because the idea has more power in the space that we're

2:23:55.440 --> 2:24:00.640
 talking about here. And robotics is like your idea means shit until you build it. So the

2:24:00.640 --> 2:24:07.840
 engineering world is a little different. But there's a kind of sense that I probably forgot

2:24:07.840 --> 2:24:14.640
 a lot of brilliant ideas that have been told to me. Do you think she pretended you don't exist?

2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:21.920
 Do you think she was so busy that she kind of forgot? She has like the stream of brilliant

2:24:21.920 --> 2:24:27.120
 people around her that there's a bunch of ideas that are swimming in the air. And you just kind

2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:32.560
 of forget people that are a little bit on the periphery on the idea generation. Or is it some

2:24:32.560 --> 2:24:40.560
 mix of both? It's not a mix of both. I know that because we corresponded. She put a graduate

2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:48.400
 student on this work. He emailed me excitedly when the results came in. So there was no ambiguity

2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:54.160
 about what had happened. What's more, when I went to publish my work, I actually sent it to Carol

2:24:54.160 --> 2:25:02.080
 in order to get her feedback because I wanted to be a good collaborator to her. And she absolutely

2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:08.240
 panned it, made many critiques that were not valid. But it was clear at that point that she became

2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:14.960
 an antagonist. And none of this adds that she couldn't possibly have forgotten the conversation.

2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:22.880
 I believe I even sent her tissues at some point in part, not related to this project,

2:25:22.880 --> 2:25:27.120
 but as a favor, she was doing another project that involved telomeres. And she needed samples that

2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:33.360
 I could get a hold of because of the Museum of Zoology that I was in. So this was not a one off

2:25:33.360 --> 2:25:37.040
 conversation. I certainly know that those sorts of things can happen, but that's not what happened

2:25:37.040 --> 2:25:44.720
 here. This was a relationship that existed and then was suddenly cut short at the point that she

2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:48.240
 published her paper by surprise without saying where the hypothesis had come from

2:25:48.240 --> 2:25:53.920
 and began to be a opposing force to my work.

2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:58.000
 Is there, there's a bunch of trajectories that could have taken through life.

2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:09.120
 Do you think about the trajectory of being a researcher of then going to war in the space

2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:16.320
 of ideas of publishing further papers along this line? I mean, that's often the dynamic of

2:26:16.320 --> 2:26:22.400
 that fascinating space is you have a junior researcher with brilliant ideas and a senior

2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:26.560
 researcher that that starts out as a mentor that becomes a competitor. I mean, that, that,

2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:34.640
 that happens. But then the way to, it's an almost an opportunity to shine is to publish a bunch

2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:42.480
 more papers in this place, like to tear it apart, to dig into, like really make it a war of ideas.

2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:48.320
 Did you consider that possible trajectory? I did have a couple of things to say about it.

2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:55.440
 One, this work was not central for me. I took a year on the telomere project because something

2:26:55.440 --> 2:27:00.080
 fascinating occurred to me and I pursued it. And the more I pursued it, the clearer it was.

2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:06.720
 There was something there, but it wasn't the focus of my graduate work. And I didn't want to become

2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:13.680
 a telomere researcher. What I want to do is to be an evolutionary biologist who upgrades the toolkit

2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:19.360
 of evolutionary concepts so that we can see more clearly how organisms function and why.

2:27:20.080 --> 2:27:26.400
 And telomeres was a proof of concept, right? That paper was a proof of concept that the

2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:36.560
 toolkit in question works as for the need to pursue it further. I think it's kind of

2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:40.160
 absurd and you're not the first person to say, maybe that was the way to go about it. But the

2:27:40.160 --> 2:27:47.360
 basic point is, look, the work was good. It turned out to be highly predictive. Frankly,

2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:54.880
 the model of senescence that I presented is now widely accepted. And I don't feel any misgivings

2:27:54.880 --> 2:28:00.320
 at all about having spent a year on it, said my piece and moved on to other things, which frankly,

2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:05.840
 I think are bigger. I think there's a lot of good to be done and it would be a waste to get

2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:14.960
 overly, narrowly focused. There's so many ways through the space of science and the most common

2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:21.040
 ways to just publish a lot. Publish a lot of papers, do these incremental work and exploring the

2:28:21.040 --> 2:28:26.880
 space, kind of like ants looking for food. You're tossing out a bunch of different ideas. Some of

2:28:26.880 --> 2:28:31.840
 them could be brilliant breakthrough ideas, nature. Some of them are more conference kind of publications,

2:28:31.840 --> 2:28:37.040
 all those kinds of things. Did you consider that kind of path in science?

2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:44.640
 Of course I considered it, but I must say the experience of having my first encounter with

2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:52.320
 the process of peer review be this story, which was frankly a debacle from one end to the other

2:28:52.320 --> 2:28:59.040
 with respect to the process of publishing. It was not a very good sales pitch for

2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:03.360
 trying to make a difference through publication. I would point out part of what I ran into and

2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:09.840
 I think frankly part of what explains Carol's behavior is that in some parts of science,

2:29:10.560 --> 2:29:18.000
 there is this dynamic where PIs parasitize their underlings and if you're very, very good,

2:29:19.120 --> 2:29:25.120
 you rise to the level where one day instead of being parasitized, you get to parasitize others.

2:29:25.120 --> 2:29:30.320
 Now I find that scientifically despicable and it wasn't the culture of the lab I grew up in

2:29:30.320 --> 2:29:36.960
 at all, my lab. In fact, the PI, Dick Alexander, who's now gone, but who was an incredible

2:29:37.600 --> 2:29:43.680
 mind and a great human being, he didn't want his graduate students working on the same topics he

2:29:43.680 --> 2:29:50.000
 was on. Not because it wouldn't have been useful and exciting, but because in effect he did not

2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:56.720
 want any confusion about who had done what because he was a great mentor and the idea was actually

2:29:57.680 --> 2:30:03.600
 a great mentor is not stealing ideas and you don't want people thinking that they are. So

2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:13.440
 anyway, my point would be I wasn't up for being parasitized. I don't like the idea that if you

2:30:13.440 --> 2:30:18.000
 are very good, you get parasitized until it's your turn to parasitize others. That doesn't

2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:25.280
 make sense to me. A crossing over from evolution into cellular biology may have exposed me to that.

2:30:25.280 --> 2:30:30.400
 That may have been par for the course, but it doesn't make it acceptable. And I would also

2:30:30.400 --> 2:30:39.600
 point out that my work falls in the realm of synthesis. My work generally takes evidence

2:30:39.600 --> 2:30:47.920
 accumulated by others and places it together in order to generate hypotheses that explain sets

2:30:47.920 --> 2:30:55.600
 of phenomena that are otherwise intractable. And I am not sure that that is best done with

2:30:55.600 --> 2:31:02.320
 narrow publications that are read by few. And in fact, I would point to the very conspicuous

2:31:02.320 --> 2:31:07.120
 example of Richard Dawkins, who I must say I've learned a tremendous amount from and I greatly

2:31:07.120 --> 2:31:15.600
 admire. Dawkins has almost no publication record in the sense of peer reviewed papers in journals.

2:31:15.600 --> 2:31:19.920
 What he's done instead is done synthetic work and he's published it in books which are not

2:31:20.480 --> 2:31:25.920
 peer reviewed in the same sense. And frankly, I think there's no doubting his contribution

2:31:25.920 --> 2:31:33.600
 to the field. So my sense is if Richard Dawkins can illustrate that one can make contributions

2:31:33.600 --> 2:31:39.760
 to the field without using journals as the primary mechanism for distributing what you've come to

2:31:39.760 --> 2:31:44.560
 understand, then it's obviously a valid mechanism and it's a far better one from the point of view

2:31:44.560 --> 2:31:48.400
 of accomplishing what I want to accomplish. Yeah, it's really interesting. There is, of course,

2:31:48.400 --> 2:31:53.920
 several levels. You can do the kind of synthesis and that does require a lot of both broad and

2:31:53.920 --> 2:31:59.120
 deep thinking is exceptionally valuable. You could also, I'm working on something with Andrew

2:31:59.120 --> 2:32:04.160
 Huberman now. You can also publish synthesis that's like review papers. They're exceptionally

2:32:04.160 --> 2:32:09.600
 valuable for the communities. It brings the community together, tells a history, tells a

2:32:09.600 --> 2:32:14.240
 story where the community has been. It paints a picture of where the path lays for the future.

2:32:14.240 --> 2:32:18.240
 I think it's really valuable. And Richard Dawkins is a good example of somebody that does that in

2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:24.880
 book form, that he kind of walks the line really interestingly. You have like somebody who like

2:32:24.880 --> 2:32:29.920
 Neil deGrasse Tyson, who's more like a science communicator. Richard Dawkins sometimes is a

2:32:29.920 --> 2:32:34.880
 science communicator, but he gets like close to the technical to where it's a little bit,

2:32:35.520 --> 2:32:42.480
 it's not shying away from being really a contribution to science. No, he's made real

2:32:42.480 --> 2:32:49.040
 contributions in book form. Yes, he really has. It's fascinating. Roger Pernarose,

2:32:49.040 --> 2:32:54.480
 I mean, similar kind of idea. That's interesting. That's interesting. Synthesis does not, especially

2:32:54.480 --> 2:33:01.280
 synthesis work. Work that synthesizes ideas does not necessarily need to be peer reviewed.

2:33:02.720 --> 2:33:11.520
 It's peer reviewed by peers reading it. Well, and reviewing it. That's it. It is reviewed by peers,

2:33:11.520 --> 2:33:15.360
 which is not synonymous with peer review. And that's the thing is people don't understand

2:33:15.360 --> 2:33:20.960
 that the two things aren't the same, right? Peer review is an anonymous process that happens

2:33:20.960 --> 2:33:27.360
 before publication in a place where there is a power dynamic. I mean, the joke, of course,

2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:32.240
 is that peer review is actually peer preview, right? Your biggest competitors get to see

2:33:32.240 --> 2:33:37.440
 your work before it sees the light of day and decide whether or not it gets published. And

2:33:38.480 --> 2:33:43.280
 you know, again, when you're formative experience with the publication apparatus is the one I had

2:33:43.280 --> 2:33:49.200
 with the telomere paper, there's no way that that seems like the right way to advance important

2:33:49.200 --> 2:33:55.360
 ideas. And you know, what's the harm in publishing them so that your peers have to review them in

2:33:55.360 --> 2:33:59.440
 public where they actually, if they're going to disagree with you, they actually have to take

2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:04.320
 the risk of saying, I don't think this is right. And here's why, right? With their name on it.

2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:08.320
 I'd much rather that it's not that I don't want my work reviewed by peers, but I want it done

2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:13.360
 in the open, you know, for the same reason you don't meet with dangerous people in private,

2:34:13.360 --> 2:34:17.280
 you meet at the cafe, I want the work reviewed out in public.

2:34:18.640 --> 2:34:21.040
 Can I ask you a difficult question? Sure.

2:34:23.600 --> 2:34:31.760
 There is popularity in martyrdom. There's popularity in pointing out that the emperor has no clothes.

2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:37.040
 That, that can become a drug in itself.

2:34:40.880 --> 2:34:44.960
 I've confronted this in scientific work I've done at MIT,

2:34:46.800 --> 2:34:51.360
 where there are certain things they're not done well. People are not being the best version of

2:34:51.360 --> 2:35:02.160
 themselves. And particular aspects of a particular field are in need of a revolution.

2:35:03.200 --> 2:35:12.480
 And part of me wanted to point that out versus doing the hard work of publishing papers and

2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:18.320
 doing the revolution, basically just pointing out, look, you guys are doing it wrong and then

2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:28.240
 just walking away. Are you aware of the drug of martyrdom, of the ego involved in it,

2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:34.480
 that it can cloud your thinking? Probably one of the best questions I've ever been asked.

2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:43.040
 So let me, let me try to sort it out. First of all, we are all mysteries to ourselves at some

2:35:43.040 --> 2:35:48.160
 level. So there's possible there's stuff going on in me that I'm not aware of that's driving.

2:35:48.160 --> 2:35:54.080
 But in general, I would say one of my better strengths is that I'm not especially ego driven.

2:35:55.120 --> 2:36:01.680
 I have an ego. I clearly think highly of myself, but it is not driving me. I do not crave that

2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:08.640
 kind of validation. I do crave certain things. I do love a good Eureka moment. There is something

2:36:08.640 --> 2:36:12.960
 great about it. And there's something even better about the phone calls you make next when you share

2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:22.240
 it. It's pretty fun. I really like it. I also really like my subject. There's something about

2:36:22.240 --> 2:36:27.920
 a walk in the forest when you have a toolkit in which you can actually look at creatures and see

2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:35.280
 something deep. I like it. That drives me. And I could entertain myself for the rest of my life.

2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:41.520
 If I was somehow isolated from the rest of the world, but I was in a place that was biologically

2:36:41.520 --> 2:36:47.600
 interesting, you know, hopefully I would be with people that I love and pets that I love,

2:36:47.600 --> 2:36:52.160
 believe it or not. But, you know, if I were in that situation and I could just go out every day

2:36:52.160 --> 2:36:56.560
 and look at cool stuff and figure out what it means, I could be all right with that.

2:36:56.560 --> 2:37:05.760
 So I'm not heavily driven by the ego thing as you put it. So I am completely the same except

2:37:05.760 --> 2:37:11.920
 that instead of the pets, I would put robots. But so it's not, it's the Eureka. It's the exploration

2:37:11.920 --> 2:37:16.880
 of the subject that brings you joy and fulfillment. It's not the ego.

2:37:17.680 --> 2:37:22.640
 Well, there's more to say. No, I really don't think it's the ego thing. I will say I also have

2:37:22.640 --> 2:37:28.880
 kind of a secondary passion for robot stuff. I've never made anything useful, but I do believe,

2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:33.680
 I believe I found my calling. But if this wasn't my calling, my calling would have been

2:37:33.680 --> 2:37:39.280
 inventing stuff. I really enjoy that too. So I get what you're saying about the analogy quite

2:37:39.280 --> 2:37:48.560
 well. As far as the martyrdom thing, I understand the drug you're talking about, and I've seen it

2:37:49.120 --> 2:37:54.800
 more than I felt it. I do, if I'm just to be completely candid and that this question is

2:37:54.800 --> 2:38:04.080
 so good, it deserves a candid answer, I do like the fight. I like fighting against people I don't

2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:11.120
 respect and I like winning. But I have no interest in martyrdom. One of the reasons I have no

2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:17.520
 interest in martyrdom is that I'm having too good a time. I very much enjoy my life and

2:38:17.520 --> 2:38:24.960
 such a good answer. I have a wonderful wife. I have amazing children. I live in a lovely place.

2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:32.560
 I don't want to exit any quicker than I have to. That said, I also believe in things and a

2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:38.480
 willingness to exit if that's the only way is not exactly inviting martyrdom, but it is an

2:38:38.480 --> 2:38:44.640
 acceptance that fighting is dangerous and going up against powerful forces means who knows what

2:38:44.640 --> 2:38:50.400
 will come of it, right? I don't have the sense that the thing is out there that used to kill

2:38:50.400 --> 2:38:53.920
 inconvenient people. I don't think that's how it's done anymore. It's primarily done through

2:38:54.800 --> 2:39:00.720
 destroying them reputationally, which is not something I relish the possibility of. But

2:39:01.360 --> 2:39:11.280
 there is a difference between a willingness to face the hazard rather than a desire to face it

2:39:11.280 --> 2:39:20.320
 because of the thrill, right? For me, the thrill is in fighting when I'm in the right. I think I

2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:28.800
 feel that that is a worthwhile way to take what I see as the kind of brutality that is built into

2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:35.120
 men and to channel it to something useful, right? If it is not channeled into something useful,

2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:38.400
 it will be channeled into something else. So it damn well better be channeled into something

2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:45.360
 useful. It's not motivated by fame and popularity, those kinds of things. You're just making me

2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:53.040
 realize that enjoying the fight, fighting the powerful and idea that you believe is right,

2:39:55.280 --> 2:40:03.760
 is a kind of optimism for the human spirit. It's like we can win this.

2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:12.400
 It's almost like you're turning into action, into personal action, this hope for humanity

2:40:13.360 --> 2:40:23.760
 by saying we can win this. That makes you feel good about the rest of humanity. If there's people

2:40:23.760 --> 2:40:32.080
 like me, then we're going to be okay. Even if your ideas might be wrong or not, but if you believe

2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:39.200
 they're right and you're fighting the powerful against all odds, then we're going to be okay.

2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:48.240
 If I were to project, because I enjoy the fight as well, I think that's the way I,

2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:55.120
 that's what brings me joy, is it's almost like it's optimism in action.

2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:01.600
 Well, it's a little different for me. And again, I recognize you. You're familiar,

2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:08.880
 your construction is familiar, even if it isn't mine, right? For me, I actually expect us not to

2:41:08.880 --> 2:41:16.240
 be okay. And I'm not okay with that. But what's really important, if I feel like what I've said is

2:41:16.240 --> 2:41:22.000
 I don't know of any reason that it's too late. As far as I know, we could still save humanity and

2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:27.280
 we could get to the fourth frontier or something akin to it. But I expect us not to, I expect us

2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:33.040
 to fuck it up, right? I don't like that thought, but I've looked into the abyss and I've done my

2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:39.680
 calculations and the number of ways we could not succeed are many and the number of ways that we

2:41:39.680 --> 2:41:45.360
 could manage to get out of this very dangerous phase of history is small. But the thing I don't

2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:54.080
 have to worry about is that I didn't do enough, right? That I was a coward, that I, you know,

2:41:54.080 --> 2:42:00.000
 prioritized other things. At the end of the day, I think I will be able to say to myself, and in

2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:05.920
 fact, the thing that allows me to sleep is that when I saw clearly what needed to be done, I tried

2:42:05.920 --> 2:42:11.920
 to do it to the extent that it was in my power. And, you know, if we fail, as I expect us to,

2:42:12.640 --> 2:42:18.000
 I can't say, well, geez, that's on me, you know, and, you know, frankly, I regard what I just said

2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:24.080
 to you as something like a personality defect, right? I'm trying to free myself from the sense

2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:28.720
 that this is my fault. On the other hand, my guess is that personality defect is probably

2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:34.960
 good for humanity, right? It's a good one for me to have it, you know, the externalities of it

2:42:34.960 --> 2:42:41.760
 are positive, so I don't feel too bad about it. Yeah, that's funny. So, yeah, our perspective on the

2:42:41.760 --> 2:42:48.960
 world are different, but they rhyme, like you said, because I've also looked into the abyss, and it

2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:56.400
 kind of smiled nervously back. So, I have a more optimistic sense that we're going to win more than

2:42:56.400 --> 2:43:02.160
 likely we're going to be okay. Right there with you, brother. I'm hoping you're right. I'm expecting

2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:08.720
 me to be right. But back to Eric, you had a wonderful conversation. In that conversation,

2:43:08.720 --> 2:43:15.120
 he played the big brother role, and he was very happy about it. He was self congratulatory about

2:43:15.120 --> 2:43:23.040
 it. I mean, can you talk to the ways in which Eric made your better man throughout your life?

2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:30.880
 Yeah, hell yeah. I mean, for one thing, you know, Eric and I are interestingly similar in some ways

2:43:30.880 --> 2:43:35.760
 and radically different in some other ways. And, you know, it's often a matter of fascination to

2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:40.160
 people who know us both because almost always people meet one of us first, and they sort of get

2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:44.880
 used to that thing, and then they meet the other, and it throws the model into chaos. But, you know,

2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:51.280
 I had a great advantage, which is I came second, right? So, although it was kind of a pain in the

2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:56.080
 ass to be born into a world that had Eric in it because he's a force of nature, right? It was

2:43:56.080 --> 2:44:04.160
 also terrifically useful because, A, he was a very awesome older brother who, you know, made

2:44:04.160 --> 2:44:08.160
 interesting mistakes, learned from them and conveyed the wisdom of what he had discovered,

2:44:08.720 --> 2:44:16.000
 and that was, you know, I don't know who else ends up so lucky as to have that kind of person

2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:24.160
 blazing the trail. It also probably, you know, my hypothesis for what birth order effects are

2:44:24.720 --> 2:44:30.800
 is that they're actually adaptive, right? That the reason that a second born is different than a

2:44:30.800 --> 2:44:35.840
 first born is that they're not born into a world with the same niches in it, right? And so, the

2:44:35.840 --> 2:44:44.400
 thing about Eric is he's been completely dominant in the realm of fundamental thinking, right? Like,

2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:49.840
 what he's fascinated by is the fundamental of fundamentals, and he's excellent at it, which

2:44:49.840 --> 2:44:54.640
 meant that I was born into a world where somebody was becoming excellent in that, and for me to be

2:44:54.640 --> 2:44:59.040
 anywhere near the fundamental of fundamentals was going to be pointless, right? I was going to be

2:44:59.040 --> 2:45:03.920
 playing second fiddle forever. And I think that that actually drove me to the other end of the

2:45:03.920 --> 2:45:09.520
 continuum between fundamental and emergent. And so, I became fascinated with biology and have

2:45:09.520 --> 2:45:16.880
 been since I was three years old, right? I think Eric drove that, and I have to thank him for it

2:45:16.880 --> 2:45:23.920
 because, you know, I mean... Oh, I never thought of... So, Eric drives towards the fundamental

2:45:23.920 --> 2:45:29.360
 and you drive towards the emergent, the physics and the biology, right? Opposite ends of the

2:45:29.360 --> 2:45:35.440
 continuum. And, as Eric would be quick to point out if he was sitting here, I treat the emergent

2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:40.160
 layer, I seek the fundamentals in it, which is sort of an echo of Eric's style of thinking,

2:45:40.160 --> 2:45:50.240
 but applied to the very far complexity. He's overpoweringly argues for the importance of physics,

2:45:50.240 --> 2:45:59.120
 the fundamental of the fundamental. He's not here to defend himself. Is there an argument to be made

2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:07.760
 against that? Or biology? The emergent, the study of the thing that emerged when the fundamental

2:46:07.760 --> 2:46:13.120
 acts at the universal, at the cosmic scale and builds the beautiful thing that is us,

2:46:13.120 --> 2:46:20.560
 is much more important. Like, psychology, biology, the systems that we're actually

2:46:20.560 --> 2:46:27.200
 interacting with in this human world are much more important to understand than low level

2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:34.960
 theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Yeah, I can't say that one is more

2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:40.240
 important. I think there's probably a different time scale. I think understanding the emergent

2:46:40.240 --> 2:46:47.760
 layer is more often useful, but the bang for the buck at the far fundamental layer may be much

2:46:47.760 --> 2:46:54.480
 greater. So, for example, the fourth frontier, I'm pretty sure it's going to have to be fusion

2:46:54.480 --> 2:46:59.520
 powered. I don't think anything else will do it. But once you had fusion power, assuming we didn't

2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:04.320
 just dump fusion power on the market the way we would be likely to if it was invented usefully

2:47:04.320 --> 2:47:10.800
 tomorrow, but if we had fusion power and we had a little bit more wisdom than we have,

2:47:10.800 --> 2:47:16.560
 you could do an awful lot. And that's not going to come from people like me who, you know, look

2:47:16.560 --> 2:47:26.160
 at dynamics. Can I argue against that, please? I think the way to unlock fusion power is through

2:47:26.160 --> 2:47:33.600
 artificial intelligence. So, I think most of the breakthrough ideas in the futures of science

2:47:33.600 --> 2:47:38.320
 will be developed by AI systems. And I think in order to build intelligent AI systems,

2:47:38.960 --> 2:47:47.360
 you have to be a scholar of the fundamental of the emergent of biology, of the neuroscience,

2:47:47.360 --> 2:47:53.600
 of the way the brain works, of intelligence, of consciousness, and those things at least directly

2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:59.040
 don't have anything to do with physics. Well, you're making me a little bit sad because my

2:47:59.040 --> 2:48:06.480
 addiction to the aha moment thing is incompatible with outsourcing that job.

2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:13.120
 I don't want to outsource that thing to the AI. Actually, I've seen this happen before,

2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:18.160
 because some of the people who trained Heather and me were phylogenetic systematists,

2:48:19.200 --> 2:48:26.320
 Arnold Kluge in particular. And the problem with systematics is that to do it right

2:48:26.320 --> 2:48:31.920
 when your technology is primitive, you have to be deeply embedded in the philosophical

2:48:31.920 --> 2:48:38.880
 and the logical, right? Your method has to be based in the highest level of rigor.

2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:45.600
 Once you can sequence genes, genes can spit so much data at you that you can overwhelm

2:48:45.600 --> 2:48:51.360
 high quality work with just lots and lots and lots of automated work. And so in any in some

2:48:51.360 --> 2:48:56.560
 sense, there's a generation of phylogenetic systematists who are the last of the greats

2:48:56.560 --> 2:49:02.960
 because what's replacing them is sequencers. So anyway, maybe you're right about the AI,

2:49:02.960 --> 2:49:07.840
 and I guess I'm... Makes you sad. I like figuring stuff out.

2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:12.960
 Is there something that you disagree with Eric on? They've been trying to convince them,

2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:20.480
 you failed so far, but you will eventually succeed? You know, that is a very long list.

2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:27.680
 Eric and I have tensions over certain things that recur all the time, and I'm trying to think

2:49:27.680 --> 2:49:32.880
 what would be the ideal... Is it in the space of science, in the space of philosophy, politics,

2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:42.560
 family, love, robots? Well, all right, let me... I'm just gonna use your podcast to

2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:48.240
 make a bit of a cryptic war and just say there are many places in which I believe

2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:53.760
 that I have butted heads with Eric over the course of decades, and I have seen him move in

2:49:53.760 --> 2:49:59.280
 my direction substantially over time. You've been winning. He might win a battle here or there,

2:49:59.280 --> 2:50:03.920
 but you've been winning the war. I would not say that. It's quite possible he could say the same

2:50:03.920 --> 2:50:07.600
 thing about me, and in fact, I know that it's true. There are places where he's absolutely

2:50:07.600 --> 2:50:13.040
 convinced me, but in any case, I do believe it's at least... It may not be a totally even fight,

2:50:13.040 --> 2:50:21.120
 but it's more even than some will imagine. There are things I say that drive him nuts.

2:50:23.200 --> 2:50:32.800
 When something... You heard me talk about the... What was it? It was the autopilot that seems to

2:50:32.800 --> 2:50:39.200
 be putting a great many humans in needless medical jeopardy over the COVID 19 pandemic,

2:50:39.200 --> 2:50:47.360
 and my feeling is we can say this almost for sure. Anytime you have the appearance of some

2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:55.200
 captured gigantic entity that is censoring you on YouTube and handing down dictates from the

2:50:55.200 --> 2:51:01.520
 who and all of that, it is sure that there will be a certain amount of collusion. There's gonna

2:51:01.520 --> 2:51:05.920
 be some embarrassing emails in some places that are gonna reveal some shocking connections,

2:51:05.920 --> 2:51:11.040
 and then there's gonna be an awful lot of emergence that didn't involve collusion,

2:51:11.040 --> 2:51:14.320
 right, in which people were doing their little part of a job and something was emergent,

2:51:14.320 --> 2:51:19.440
 and you never know what the admixture is. How much are we looking at actual collusion,

2:51:19.440 --> 2:51:23.120
 and how much are we looking at an emergent process, but you should always walk in with

2:51:23.120 --> 2:51:26.800
 the sense that it's gonna be a ratio, and the question is, what is the ratio in this case?

2:51:27.520 --> 2:51:33.280
 I think this drives Eric Knott's because he is very focused on the people. I think he's focused

2:51:33.280 --> 2:51:38.480
 on the people who have a choice and make the wrong one, and anyway, he may...

2:51:38.480 --> 2:51:40.880
 The question of the ratio is the distraction to that.

2:51:41.680 --> 2:51:51.280
 I think he takes it almost as an offense because it grants cover to people who are harming others,

2:51:51.280 --> 2:52:00.400
 and I think it offends him morally, and if I had to say, I would say it alters his judgment on the

2:52:00.400 --> 2:52:07.120
 matter, but anyway, certainly useful just to leave open the two possibilities and say it's a ratio,

2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:12.480
 but we don't know which one. Brother to brother, do you love the guy?

2:52:14.160 --> 2:52:19.120
 Hell yeah, hell yeah, and I'd love him if he was just my brother, but he's also awesome,

2:52:19.120 --> 2:52:25.760
 so I love him and I love him for who he is. So let me ask you about, back to your book,

2:52:25.760 --> 2:52:32.320
 Hunter Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century. I can't wait, both for the book and the videos

2:52:32.320 --> 2:52:37.200
 you do on the book, that's really exciting that there's a structured organized way to present this.

2:52:39.600 --> 2:52:46.560
 A kind of, from an evolutionary biology perspective, a guide for the future,

2:52:46.560 --> 2:52:56.240
 using our past as the fundamental of the emergent way to present a picture of the future. Let me

2:52:56.240 --> 2:53:03.600
 ask you about something that I think about a little bit in this modern world, which is monogamy.

2:53:07.520 --> 2:53:12.240
 So I personally value monogamy. One girl, ride or die.

2:53:12.240 --> 2:53:22.160
 There you go. Ride or die, that's exactly it. But that said, I don't know the right way to approach

2:53:22.160 --> 2:53:29.360
 this, but from an evolutionary biology perspective or from just looking at modern society,

2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:35.120
 that seems to be an idea that's not, what's the right way to put it, flourishing.

2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:42.880
 You're just waning. It's waning. So I suppose,

2:53:42.880 --> 2:53:48.240
 based on your reaction, you're also a supporter of monogamy or the value of monogamy. Are you

2:53:48.240 --> 2:53:58.080
 and I just delusional? What can you say about monogamy from the context of your book,

2:53:58.080 --> 2:54:02.480
 from the context of evolutionary biology, from the context of being human?

2:54:02.480 --> 2:54:08.320
 Yeah. I can say that I fully believe that we are actually enlightened and that although monogamy

2:54:08.320 --> 2:54:13.840
 is waning, that it is not waning because there is a superior system. It is waning for predictable

2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:22.160
 other reasons. So let us just say, there is a lot of pre trans fallacy here where

2:54:23.440 --> 2:54:29.200
 people go through a phase where they recognize that actually we know a lot about the evolution

2:54:29.200 --> 2:54:35.760
 of monogamy. And we can tell from the fact that humans are somewhat sexually dimorphic,

2:54:36.560 --> 2:54:42.800
 that there has been a lot of polygyny in human history. And in fact, most of human history

2:54:42.800 --> 2:54:50.160
 was largely polygynous. But it is also the case that most of the people on earth today belong

2:54:50.160 --> 2:54:54.640
 to civilizations that are at least nominally monogamous and have practiced monogamy. And

2:54:54.640 --> 2:55:01.680
 that is not anti evolutionary. What that is, is part of what I mentioned before where human

2:55:01.680 --> 2:55:09.760
 beings can swap out their software program. And different mating patterns are favored

2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:15.840
 in different periods of history. So I would argue that the benefit of monogamy, the primary one

2:55:15.840 --> 2:55:22.560
 that drives the evolution of monogamous patterns in humans, is that it brings all adults into

2:55:22.560 --> 2:55:29.680
 child rearing. Now the reason that that matters is because human babies are very labor intensive.

2:55:29.680 --> 2:55:35.280
 In order to raise them properly having two parents is a huge asset and having more than two parents

2:55:35.280 --> 2:55:43.280
 having an extended family also very important. But what that means is that for a population

2:55:43.280 --> 2:55:49.360
 that is expanding, a monogamous mating system makes sense. It makes sense because it means

2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:55.680
 that the number of offspring that can be raised is elevated. It's elevated because all potential

2:55:55.680 --> 2:56:00.960
 parents are involved in parenting. Whereas if you sideline a bunch of males by having a polygynous

2:56:00.960 --> 2:56:05.680
 system in which one male has many females, which is typically the way that works, what you do is

2:56:05.680 --> 2:56:10.080
 you sideline all those males, which means the total amount of parental effort is lower. And

2:56:10.080 --> 2:56:17.920
 the population can't grow. So what I'm arguing is that you should expect to see populations that

2:56:17.920 --> 2:56:22.880
 face the possibility of expansion in Doris monogamy and at the point that they have reached

2:56:22.880 --> 2:56:27.920
 carrying capacity, you should expect to see polygyny break back out. And what we are seeing

2:56:27.920 --> 2:56:33.840
 is a kind of false sophistication around polyamory, which will end up breaking down into

2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:38.400
 polygyny, which will not be in the interest of most people. Really the only people whose

2:56:38.400 --> 2:56:44.560
 interest it could be argued to be in would be the very small number of males at the top who have

2:56:44.560 --> 2:56:52.000
 many partners and everybody else suffers. Is it possible to make the argument, if we focus in on

2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:59.360
 those males at the quote unquote top with many female partners, is it possible to say that

2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:05.840
 that's a suboptimal life, that a single partner is the optimal life? Well, it depends what you

2:57:05.840 --> 2:57:12.720
 mean. I have a feeling that you and I wouldn't have to go very far to figure out that what might

2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:18.480
 be evolutionarily optimal doesn't match my values as a person and I'm sure it doesn't match yours

2:57:18.480 --> 2:57:26.480
 either. Can we try to dig into that gap between those two? Sure. I mean, we can do it very simply.

2:57:29.040 --> 2:57:36.480
 Selection might favor your engaging in war against a defenseless enemy or genocide.

2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:43.600
 Right? It's not hard to figure out how that might put your genes at advantage. I don't know about

2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:48.560
 you, Lex. I'm not getting involved in no genocide. It's not going to happen. I won't do it. I will

2:57:48.560 --> 2:57:55.120
 do anything to avoid it. So some part of me has decided that my conscious self and the values

2:57:55.120 --> 2:58:02.960
 that I hold trump my evolutionary self. And once you figure out that in some extreme case,

2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:07.600
 that's true. And then you realize that that means it must be possible in many other cases and you

2:58:07.600 --> 2:58:11.040
 start going through all of the things that selection would favor and you realize that a fair

2:58:11.040 --> 2:58:17.040
 fraction of the time, actually, you're not up for this. You don't want to be some robot on a mission

2:58:17.040 --> 2:58:22.000
 that involves genocide when necessary. You want to be your own person and accomplish things that

2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:32.000
 you think are valuable. And so among those are not advocating, let's suppose you were in a position

2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:36.640
 to be one of those males at the top of a polygynous system. We both know why that would be rewarding,

2:58:37.200 --> 2:58:43.600
 right? But we also both recognize it. Do we? Yeah, sure. Lots of sex? Yeah. Okay. What else?

2:58:43.600 --> 2:58:51.360
 Lots of sex and lots of variety, right? So look, every red blooded American slash Russian male

2:58:51.360 --> 2:58:57.680
 could understand why that's appealing, right? On the other hand, it is up against an alternative,

2:58:57.680 --> 2:59:05.280
 which is having a partner with whom one is bonded, especially closely, right?

2:59:05.280 --> 2:59:15.200
 Right. And so A. Love. Right. Well, I don't want to straw man the polygyny position. Obviously,

2:59:15.200 --> 2:59:22.400
 polygyny is complex and there's nothing that stops a man presumably from loving multiple partners and

2:59:22.400 --> 2:59:27.040
 from them loving him back. But in terms of, if love is your thing, there's a question about,

2:59:27.040 --> 2:59:34.400
 okay, what is the quality of love if it is divided over multiple partners, right? And what is the net

2:59:34.400 --> 2:59:40.640
 consequence for love in a society when multiple people will be frozen out for every individual

2:59:40.640 --> 2:59:49.360
 male in this case who has it? And what I would argue is, and you know, this is weird to even talk

2:59:49.360 --> 2:59:54.000
 about, but this is partially me just talking for personal experience. I think there actually is

2:59:54.000 --> 3:00:02.640
 a monogamy program in us and it's not automatic. But if you take it seriously, you can find it and

3:00:03.520 --> 3:00:07.760
 frankly, marriage and it doesn't have to be marriage, but whatever it is that results in the

3:00:07.760 --> 3:00:13.600
 lifelong bond with a partner has gotten a very bad rap, you know, it's the butt of too many jokes.

3:00:14.240 --> 3:00:21.600
 But the truth is it's hugely rewarding. It's not easy. But if you know that you're looking for

3:00:21.600 --> 3:00:25.680
 something, right? If you know that the objective actually exists and it's not some utopian fantasy

3:00:25.680 --> 3:00:31.760
 that can't be found, if you know that there's some real world, you know, warts and all version of it,

3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:36.080
 then you might actually think, hey, that is something I want and you might pursue it. And my

3:00:36.080 --> 3:00:40.800
 guess is you'd be very happy when you find it. Yeah, I think there is getting to the fundamentals

3:00:40.800 --> 3:00:46.400
 of the emergent. I feel like there is some kind of physics of love. So one, there's a conservation

3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:53.120
 thing going on. So if you have like many partners, yeah, in theory, you should be able to love all

3:00:53.120 --> 3:00:59.920
 of them deeply. But it seems like in reality, that love gets split. Yep. Now, there's another

3:00:59.920 --> 3:01:05.280
 law that's interesting in terms of monogamy. I don't know if it's at the physics level, but

3:01:05.280 --> 3:01:13.280
 if you are in a monogamous relationship by choice, and almost as in slight rebellion

3:01:13.280 --> 3:01:20.800
 to social norms, that's much more powerful. Like if you choose that one partnership,

3:01:20.800 --> 3:01:25.680
 that's also more powerful. If like everybody's in a monogamy, there's this pressure to be

3:01:25.680 --> 3:01:30.960
 married in this pressure society, that's different because that's almost like a constraint on your

3:01:30.960 --> 3:01:37.600
 freedom that is enforced by something other than your own ideals. It's by somebody else.

3:01:37.600 --> 3:01:44.800
 When you yourself choose to, I guess, create these constraints, that enriches that love.

3:01:44.800 --> 3:01:51.120
 So there's some kind of love function, like E equals MC squared, but for love, that I feel like

3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:58.480
 if you have less partners and it's done by choice, they can maximize that. And that love can transcend

3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:06.080
 the biology, transcend the evolutionary biology forces that have to do much more with survival

3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:12.160
 and all those kinds of things. It can transcend to take us to a richer experience, which we have

3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:18.640
 the luxury of having, exploring, of happiness, of joy, of fulfillment, all those kinds of things.

3:02:19.280 --> 3:02:26.080
 Totally agree with this. And there's no question that by choice, when there are other choices,

3:02:26.640 --> 3:02:34.400
 imbues it with meaning that it might not otherwise have. I would also say, I'm really

3:02:34.400 --> 3:02:43.920
 struck by, and I have a hard time not feeling terrible sadness over what younger people are

3:02:43.920 --> 3:02:50.240
 coming to think about this topic. I think they're missing something so important and so hard to

3:02:50.240 --> 3:02:55.760
 phrase that, and they don't even know that they're missing it. They might know that they're unhappy,

3:02:55.760 --> 3:02:59.680
 but they don't understand what it is they're even looking for because nobody's really been

3:02:59.680 --> 3:03:05.440
 honest with them about what their choices are. And I have to say, if I was a young person or if I

3:03:05.440 --> 3:03:09.760
 was advising a young person, which I used to do, again, a million years ago when I was a college

3:03:09.760 --> 3:03:14.880
 professor four years ago, but I used to talk to students, I knew my students really well,

3:03:14.880 --> 3:03:18.320
 and they would ask questions about this. And they were always curious because Heather and I

3:03:18.320 --> 3:03:22.800
 seemed to have a good relationship and many of them knew both of us. So they would talk to us

3:03:22.800 --> 3:03:31.280
 about this. If I was advising somebody, I would say, do not bypass the possibility that what you

3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:38.720
 are supposed to do is find somebody worthy, somebody who can handle it, somebody who you are

3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:43.120
 compatible with, and that you don't have to be perfectly compatible. It's not about dating until

3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:50.480
 you find the one. It's about finding somebody who's underlying values and viewpoint are complementary

3:03:50.480 --> 3:03:59.040
 to yours, sufficient that you fall in love. If you find that person, opt out together. Get out

3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:03.600
 of this damn system that's telling you what's sophisticated to think about love and romance

3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:11.440
 and sex, ignore it together, right? That's the key. And I believe you'll end up laughing in the end

3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:18.240
 if you do it, you'll discover, wow, that's a hellscape that I opted out of. And this thing I

3:04:18.240 --> 3:04:25.680
 opted into, complicated, difficult, worth it. Nothing that's worth it is ever not difficult.

3:04:25.680 --> 3:04:31.760
 So we should even just skip the whole statement about difficult. Yeah. All right. I want to be

3:04:31.760 --> 3:04:39.600
 honest. It's not like, oh, it's nonstop joy. No, it's fricking complex, but worth it? No question

3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:46.160
 in my mind. Is there advice outside of love that you can give to young people? You were a million

3:04:46.160 --> 3:04:52.560
 years ago, a professor. Is there advice you can give to young people, high schoolers, college

3:04:52.560 --> 3:04:59.520
 students about career, about life? Yeah, but they're not going to like it because it's not easy to

3:04:59.520 --> 3:05:04.000
 operationalize. And this was a problem when I was a college professor too. People would ask me

3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:08.240
 what they should do. Should they go to graduate school? I had almost nothing useful to say

3:05:08.240 --> 3:05:16.000
 because the job market and the market of pre job training and all of that, these things are all

3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:23.760
 so distorted and corrupt that I didn't want to point anybody to anything, right? Because it's

3:05:23.760 --> 3:05:30.720
 all broken. And I would tell them that. But I would say that results in a kind of meta level

3:05:30.720 --> 3:05:37.040
 advice that I do think is useful. You don't know what's coming. You don't know where the opportunities

3:05:37.040 --> 3:05:43.600
 will be. You should invest in tools rather than knowledge, right? To the extent that you can

3:05:43.600 --> 3:05:49.040
 do things, you can repurpose that no matter what the future brings to the extent that, you know,

3:05:49.040 --> 3:05:56.160
 if you as a robot guy, right, you've got the skills of a robot guy. Now, if civilization

3:05:56.160 --> 3:06:02.480
 failed and the stuff of robot building disappeared with it, you'd still have the mind of a robot guy

3:06:02.480 --> 3:06:07.280
 and the mind of a robot guy can retool around all kinds of things, whether you're, you know,

3:06:07.280 --> 3:06:13.920
 forced to work with, you know, fibers that are made into ropes, right? Your mechanical

3:06:13.920 --> 3:06:18.480
 mind would be useful in all kinds of places. So invest in tools like that that can be easily

3:06:18.480 --> 3:06:27.440
 repurposed and invest in combinations of tools, right? If civilization keeps limping along,

3:06:28.800 --> 3:06:32.400
 you're going to be up against all sorts of people who have studied the things that you

3:06:32.400 --> 3:06:36.240
 studied, right? If you think, hey, computer programming is really, really cool. And you

3:06:36.240 --> 3:06:41.280
 pick up computer programming, guess what? You just entered a large group of people who have that skill

3:06:41.280 --> 3:06:46.880
 and many of them will be better than you, almost certainly. On the other hand, if you combine

3:06:46.880 --> 3:06:52.720
 that with something else that's very rarely combined with it, if you have, I don't know,

3:06:52.720 --> 3:06:58.240
 if it's carpentry and computer programming, if you take combinations of things that are,

3:06:58.880 --> 3:07:02.080
 even if they're both common, but they're not commonly found together,

3:07:02.080 --> 3:07:08.240
 then those combinations create a rarefied space where you inhabit it. And even if the things

3:07:08.240 --> 3:07:13.600
 don't even really touch, but nonetheless, they create a mind in which the two things are live

3:07:13.600 --> 3:07:18.400
 and you can move back and forth between them and, you know, step out of your own perspective by

3:07:18.400 --> 3:07:24.320
 moving from one to the other, that will increase what you can see and the quality of your tools.

3:07:24.320 --> 3:07:27.920
 And so anyway, that isn't useful advice. It doesn't tell you whether you should go to graduate

3:07:27.920 --> 3:07:33.680
 school or not, but it does tell you the one thing we can say for certain about the future is that

3:07:33.680 --> 3:07:38.800
 it's uncertain and so prepare for it. And like you said, there's cool things to be discovered

3:07:38.800 --> 3:07:45.200
 in the intersection of fields and ideas. And I would look at grad school that way, actually,

3:07:45.200 --> 3:07:54.480
 if you do go. Or I see, I mean, this is such a, like every course in grad school, undergrad too,

3:07:54.480 --> 3:08:01.040
 was like this little journey that you're on that explores a particular field. And it's not

3:08:01.040 --> 3:08:09.360
 immediately obvious how useful it is, but it allows you to discover intersections between that thing

3:08:09.360 --> 3:08:15.760
 and some other thing. So you're bringing to the table this, these pieces of knowledge,

3:08:16.480 --> 3:08:22.400
 some of which when intersected might create a niche that's completely novel, unique and will

3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:28.000
 bring you joy out of that. I mean, I took a huge number of courses in theoretical computer science.

3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:33.840
 Most of them seem useless, but they totally changed the way I see the world in ways that are,

3:08:33.840 --> 3:08:38.800
 I'm not prepared or is a little bit difficult to kind of make explicit, but

3:08:40.880 --> 3:08:48.240
 taken together, they've allowed me to see, for example, the world of robotics totally different

3:08:48.240 --> 3:08:53.680
 and different from many of my colleagues and friends and so on. And I think that's a good

3:08:53.680 --> 3:09:01.840
 way to see if you go to grad school as an opportunity to explore intersections of fields,

3:09:01.840 --> 3:09:07.040
 even if the individual fields seem useless. Yeah. And useless doesn't mean useless, right?

3:09:07.040 --> 3:09:12.560
 Useless means not directly applicable, but a good useless course can be the best one you ever took.

3:09:12.560 --> 3:09:19.920
 Right. Yeah. I took James Joyce course on James Joyce and that was truly useless.

3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:27.280
 Well, I took, I took immunobiology in the medical school when I was at Penn as,

3:09:28.720 --> 3:09:32.080
 I guess I would have been a freshman or a sophomore. I wasn't supposed to be in this class.

3:09:32.960 --> 3:09:39.520
 It blew my goddamn mind and it still does, right? I mean, we had this, I don't even know who it was,

3:09:39.520 --> 3:09:44.000
 but we had this great professor who was like a highly placed in the world of immunobiology.

3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:49.680
 You know, the course is called immunobiology, not immunology. Immunobiology, it had the right

3:09:49.680 --> 3:09:56.560
 focus. And as I recall it, the professor stood sideways to the chalkboard staring off into space,

3:09:57.200 --> 3:10:03.520
 literally stroking his beard with this bemused look on his face through the entire lecture.

3:10:04.160 --> 3:10:07.040
 And, you know, you had all these medical students who were so furiously writing notes

3:10:07.040 --> 3:10:09.920
 that I don't even think they were noticing the person delivering this thing. But,

3:10:10.560 --> 3:10:15.600
 you know, I got what this guy was smiling about. It was like so, what he was describing,

3:10:15.600 --> 3:10:20.080
 you know, adaptive immunity is so marvelous, right? That it was like almost a privilege

3:10:20.080 --> 3:10:24.320
 to even be saying it to a room full of people who were listening, you know? But anyway,

3:10:24.320 --> 3:10:28.800
 yeah, I took that course and, you know, lo and behold, COVID. That's not going to be useful.

3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:35.920
 Well, yeah, suddenly it's front and center. And wow, am I glad I took it. But anyway, yeah,

3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:40.880
 useless courses are great. And actually, Eric gave me one of the greater pieces of advice,

3:10:40.880 --> 3:10:46.320
 at least for college that anyone's ever given, which was don't worry about the prerex. Take it

3:10:46.320 --> 3:10:51.760
 anyway, right? But now I don't even know if kids can do this now because the prerex are now enforced

3:10:51.760 --> 3:10:58.240
 by a computer. But back in the day, if you didn't mention that you didn't have the prerex, nobody

3:10:58.240 --> 3:11:02.880
 stopped you from taking the course. And what he told me, which I didn't know was that often the

3:11:02.880 --> 3:11:10.240
 advanced courses are easier in some way. The material's complex. But, you know, it's not like

3:11:10.880 --> 3:11:15.520
 intro bio where you're learning a thousand things at once, right? It's like focused on

3:11:15.520 --> 3:11:18.640
 something. So if you dedicate yourself, you can, you can pull it off.

3:11:18.640 --> 3:11:22.720
 Yeah, stay with an idea for many weeks at a time. And it's ultimately rewarding,

3:11:22.720 --> 3:11:27.120
 and not as difficult as it looks. Can I ask you a ridiculous question?

3:11:27.120 --> 3:11:34.400
 Please. What do you think is the meaning of life? Well,

3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:40.160
 I feel terrible having to give you the answer. I realize you asked the question,

3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:44.160
 but if I tell you, you're going to again feel bad. I don't want to do that. But

3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:49.520
 look, there's two, there can be a disappointment is no, it's going to be a horror, right?

3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:52.960
 Because we actually know the answer to the question. Oh, no.

3:11:52.960 --> 3:12:00.160
 So it's completely meaningless. There is nothing that we can do that escapes the heat death of

3:12:00.160 --> 3:12:04.320
 the universe or whatever it is that happens at the end. And we're not going to make it there

3:12:04.320 --> 3:12:11.680
 anyway. But even if you were optimistic about our ability to escape every existential hazard

3:12:12.240 --> 3:12:15.600
 indefinitely, ultimately, it's all for nothing. We know it, right?

3:12:15.600 --> 3:12:22.560
 Right. That said, once you stare into that abyss, and then it stares back and laughs or

3:12:22.560 --> 3:12:28.880
 whatever happens, right? Then the question is, okay, given that, can I relax a little bit,

3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:34.800
 right? And figure out, well, what would make sense if that were true, right? And I think

3:12:34.800 --> 3:12:39.680
 there's something very clear to me. I think if you do all of the, you know, if I just take the

3:12:39.680 --> 3:12:45.440
 values that I'm sure we share and extrapolate from them, I think the following thing is actually

3:12:45.440 --> 3:12:53.120
 a moral imperative. Being a human and having opportunity is absolutely fucking awesome,

3:12:53.760 --> 3:12:56.960
 right? A lot of people don't make use of the opportunity and a lot of people don't have

3:12:56.960 --> 3:13:01.520
 opportunity, right? They get to be human, but they're too constrained by keeping a roof over

3:13:01.520 --> 3:13:08.800
 their heads to really be free. But being a free human is fantastic. And being a free human on

3:13:08.800 --> 3:13:15.440
 this beautiful planet, crippled as it may be, is unparalleled. I mean, what could be better? How

3:13:15.440 --> 3:13:21.680
 lucky are we that we get that, right? So if that's true, that it is awesome to be human and to be

3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:27.920
 free, then surely it is our obligation to deliver that opportunity to as many people as we can.

3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:35.920
 And how do you do that? Well, I think I know what job one is. Job one is we have to get sustainable.

3:13:35.920 --> 3:13:41.920
 The way to get the maximum number of humans to have that opportunity to be both here and free

3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:46.800
 is to make sure that there isn't a limit on how long we can keep doing this. That effectively

3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:53.760
 requires us to reach sustainability. And then at sustainability, you could have a horror show of

3:13:53.760 --> 3:13:59.680
 sustainability, right? You could have a totalitarian sustainability. That's not the objective. The

3:13:59.680 --> 3:14:04.320
 objective is to liberate people. And so the question, the whole fourth frontier question,

3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:09.920
 frankly, is how do you get to a sustainable and indefinitely sustainable state

3:14:10.560 --> 3:14:15.680
 in which people feel liberated, in which they are liberated to pursue the things that actually

3:14:15.680 --> 3:14:24.160
 matter, to pursue beauty, truth, compassion, connection, all of those things that we could

3:14:24.160 --> 3:14:29.680
 list as unalloyed goods. Those are the things that people should be most liberated to do in

3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:35.920
 a system that really functions. And anyway, my point is, I don't know how precise that

3:14:35.920 --> 3:14:41.360
 calculation is, but I'm pretty sure it's not wrong. It's accurate enough. And if it is accurate

3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:46.400
 enough, then the point is, okay, well, there's no ultimate meaning, but the proximate meaning

3:14:46.400 --> 3:14:50.880
 is that one. How many people can we get to have this wonderful experience that we've gotten to

3:14:50.880 --> 3:14:57.120
 have, right? And there's no way that's so wrong that if I invest my life in it, that I'm making

3:14:57.120 --> 3:15:03.360
 some big error for that. Life is awesome. And we want to spread the awesome as much as possible.

3:15:03.360 --> 3:15:07.760
 Yeah, you sum it up that way, spread the awesome, spread the awesome. So that's the fourth frontier.

3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:12.800
 And if that fails, if the fourth frontier fails, the fifth frontier will be defined by robots.

3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:19.040
 And hopefully they'll learn the lessons of the mistakes that the humans made and build a better

3:15:19.040 --> 3:15:23.120
 world. I hope they're very happy here and that they do a better job with the place than we did.

3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:32.560
 But I can't believe it took us this long to talk. As I mentioned to you before, that we haven't

3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:39.680
 actually spoken, I think at all. And I've always felt that we're already friends. I don't know how

3:15:39.680 --> 3:15:46.080
 that works, because I've listened to your podcast a lot. I've also sort of loved your brother. And

3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:52.240
 so it was like we've known each other for the longest time. And I hope we can be friends and

3:15:52.240 --> 3:15:57.760
 talk often again. And I hope that you get a chance to meet some of my robot friends as well

3:15:57.760 --> 3:16:04.000
 and fall in love. And I'm so glad that you love robots as well. So we get to share in that love.

3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:10.640
 So I can't wait for us to interact together. So we went from talking about some of the worst

3:16:10.640 --> 3:16:17.840
 failures of humanity to some of the most beautiful aspects of humanity. What else can you ask for

3:16:17.840 --> 3:16:22.800
 from a conversation? Thank you so much for talking to me. You know, Alex, I feel the same way towards

3:16:22.800 --> 3:16:26.640
 you. And I really appreciate it. This has been a lot of fun. And I'm looking forward to our next one.

3:16:27.680 --> 3:16:31.200
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brett Weinstein. And thank you to

3:16:31.200 --> 3:16:37.200
 Jordan Harbinger's show, ExpressVPN, Magic Spoon and ForSigmatic. Check them out in the

3:16:37.200 --> 3:16:42.720
 description to support this podcast. And now, let me leave you with some words from Charles Darwin.

3:16:42.720 --> 3:16:49.600
 Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge. It is those who know little,

3:16:49.600 --> 3:16:55.840
 not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved

3:16:55.840 --> 3:17:13.760
 by science. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
