00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
 The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram, a computer scientist, mathematician,

00:04.480 --> 00:10.480
 and theoretical physicist who is the founder and CEO of Wolfram Research, a company behind

00:10.480 --> 00:15.440
 Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language, and the new Wolfram Physics Project.

00:16.160 --> 00:22.400
 He's the author of several books, including A New Kind of Science, which, on a personal note,

00:22.400 --> 00:27.520
 was one of the most influential books in my journey in computer science and artificial

00:27.520 --> 00:32.640
 intelligence. It made me fall in love with the mathematical beauty and power of cellular

00:32.640 --> 00:39.520
 automata. It is true that perhaps one of the criticisms of Stephen is on a human level,

00:39.520 --> 00:44.720
 that he has a big ego, which prevents some researchers from fully enjoying the content

00:44.720 --> 00:51.280
 of his ideas. We talk about this point in this conversation. To me, ego can lead you astray,

00:51.280 --> 00:58.400
 but can also be a superpower, one that fuels bold, innovative thinking that refuses to surrender to

00:58.400 --> 01:05.440
 the cautious ways of academic institutions. And here, especially, I ask you to join me in looking

01:05.440 --> 01:10.880
 past the peculiarities of human nature and opening your mind to the beauty of ideas

01:10.880 --> 01:16.160
 in Stephen's work and in this conversation. I believe Stephen Wolfram is one of the most

01:16.160 --> 01:22.240
 original minds of our time, and, at the core, is a kind, curious, and brilliant human being.

01:22.960 --> 01:28.800
 This conversation was recorded in November 2019, when the Wolfram Physics Project was underway,

01:28.800 --> 01:34.320
 but not yet ready for public exploration as it is now. We now agreed to talk again,

01:34.320 --> 01:40.240
 probably multiple times, in the near future, so this is round one, and stay tuned for round two soon.

01:40.240 --> 01:46.000

 and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App does fractional share trading,

02:36.800 --> 02:41.200
 let me mention that the order execution algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the

02:41.200 --> 02:47.120
 abstraction of fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel. It's a big props to the Cash App engineers

02:47.120 --> 02:51.840
 for solving a hard problem that in the end provides an easy interface that takes a step

02:51.840 --> 02:57.520
 up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market. This makes trading more accessible

02:57.520 --> 03:03.680
 for new investors and diversification much easier. So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,

04:16.800 --> 04:20.880
 You and your son Christopher helped create the alien language in the movie Arrival.

04:20.880 --> 04:27.280
 So let me ask maybe a bit of a crazy question. But if aliens were to visit us on Earth,

04:27.840 --> 04:31.040
 do you think we would be able to find a common language?

04:32.560 --> 04:37.680
 Well, by the time we're saying aliens are visiting us, we've already prejudiced the whole story.

04:38.240 --> 04:43.760
 Because the concept of an alien actually visiting, so to speak, we already know

04:43.760 --> 04:49.520
 they're kind of things that make sense to talk about visiting. So we already know they exist in

04:49.520 --> 04:56.800
 the same kind of physical setup that we do. They're not, you know, it's not just radio

04:56.800 --> 05:03.200
 signals. It's an actual thing that shows up and so on. So I think in terms of, you know,

05:03.200 --> 05:10.240
 can one find ways to communicate? Well, the best example we have of this right now is AI.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.720
 I mean, that's our first sort of example of alien intelligence. And the question is,

05:14.720 --> 05:19.280
 how well do we communicate with AI? You know, if you were to say, if you were in the middle of a

05:19.280 --> 05:25.120
 neural net, and you open it up, and it's like, what are you thinking? Can you discuss things

05:25.120 --> 05:30.880
 with it? It's not easy, but it's not absolutely impossible. So I think I think by the time,

05:30.880 --> 05:37.760
 but given the setup of your question, aliens visiting, I think the answer is, yes, one will

05:37.760 --> 05:41.440
 be able to find some form of communication, whatever communication means, communication

05:41.440 --> 05:46.880
 requires notions of purpose and things like this. It's a kind of philosophical quagmire.

05:46.880 --> 05:54.480
 So if AI is a kind of alien life form, what do you think visiting looks like? So if we look at

05:55.200 --> 06:01.200
 aliens visiting, and we'll get to discuss computation and the world of computation,

06:01.200 --> 06:05.680
 but if you were to imagine, you said you already prejudiced something by saying you visit,

06:05.680 --> 06:13.280
 but how would aliens visit? By visit, there's kind of an implication, and here we're using the

06:13.280 --> 06:18.400
 imprecision of human language, you know, in a world of the future, and if that's represented in

06:18.400 --> 06:25.520
 computational language, we might be able to take the concept visit and go look in the documentation

06:25.520 --> 06:29.440
 basically and find out exactly what does that mean, what properties does it have and so on.

06:29.440 --> 06:36.240
 But by visit, in ordinary human language, I'm kind of taking it to be there's, you know,

06:36.240 --> 06:42.400
 something, a physical embodiment that shows up in a spacecraft, since we kind of know that

06:42.400 --> 06:49.680
 that's necessary. We're not imagining it's just, you know, photons showing up in a radio signal

06:49.680 --> 06:56.080
 that, you know, a photon's in some very elaborate pattern. We're imagining it's physical things

06:56.080 --> 07:00.480
 made of atoms and so on that show up. Can it be photons in a pattern?

07:01.120 --> 07:06.400
 Well, that's good question. I mean, whether there is the possibility, you know, what counts as

07:06.400 --> 07:13.280
 intelligence? Good question. I mean, it's, you know, and I used to think there was sort of a,

07:13.280 --> 07:17.280
 oh, there'll be, you know, it'll be clear what it means to find extraterrestrial intelligence,

07:17.280 --> 07:22.080
 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I've increasingly realized as a result of science that I've done

07:22.080 --> 07:27.680
 that there really isn't a bright line between the intelligent and the merely computational,

07:27.680 --> 07:33.040
 so to speak. So, you know, in our kind of everyday sort of discussion, we'll say things like,

07:33.040 --> 07:37.920
 you know, the weather has a mind of its own. Well, let's unpack that question. You know,

07:37.920 --> 07:43.680
 we realize that there are computational processes that go on that determine the fluid dynamics of

07:43.680 --> 07:48.720
 this and that and the atmosphere, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. How do we distinguish that

07:48.720 --> 07:53.440
 from the processes that go on in our brains of, you know, the physical processes that go on in

07:53.440 --> 08:00.160
 our brains? How do we separate those? How do we say the physical processes going on that

08:00.160 --> 08:04.720
 represent sophisticated computations in the weather? Oh, that's not the same as the physical

08:04.720 --> 08:08.960
 processes that go on that represent sophisticated computations in our brains. The answer is,

08:08.960 --> 08:14.320
 I don't think there is a fundamental distinction. I think the distinction for us is that there's

08:14.320 --> 08:21.280
 kind of a thread of history and so on that connects kind of what happens in different brains

08:21.280 --> 08:25.840
 to each other, so to speak. And it's a, you know, what happens in the weather is something which

08:25.840 --> 08:33.120
 is not connected by sort of a thread of civilizational history, so to speak, to what we're used to.

08:33.120 --> 08:37.520
 In our story, in the stories that the human brain told us, but maybe the weather has its own

08:37.520 --> 08:42.160
 stories that it tells itself. Absolutely. Absolutely. And that's where we run into trouble

08:42.160 --> 08:48.080
 thinking about extraterrestrial intelligence because, you know, it's like that pulsar magnetosphere

08:48.080 --> 08:52.560
 that's generating these very elaborate radio signals. You know, is that something that we

08:52.560 --> 08:57.600
 should think of as being this whole civilization that's developed over the last however long,

08:57.600 --> 09:05.120
 you know, millions of years of processes going on in the neutron star or whatever versus what,

09:05.120 --> 09:09.680
 you know, what we're used to in human intelligence. And I think it's a, I think in the end,

09:09.680 --> 09:13.440
 you know, when people talk about extraterrestrial intelligence and where is it and the whole,

09:13.440 --> 09:18.800
 you know, Fermi paradox of how come there's no other signs of intelligence in the universe.

09:19.360 --> 09:25.360
 My guess is that we've got sort of two alien forms of intelligence that we're dealing with,

09:26.160 --> 09:32.400
 artificial intelligence and sort of physical or extraterrestrial intelligence. And my guess

09:32.400 --> 09:36.560
 is people will sort of get comfortable with the fact that both of these have been achieved

09:36.560 --> 09:43.360
 around the same time. And in other words, people will say, well, yes, we're used to computers,

09:44.080 --> 09:48.160
 things we've created, digital things we've created being sort of intelligent like we are.

09:48.160 --> 09:52.400
 And they'll say, oh, we're kind of also used to the idea that there are things around the universe

09:52.400 --> 09:57.760
 that are kind of intelligent like we are, except they don't share the sort of

09:57.760 --> 10:03.600
 civilizational history that we have. And so we don't, you know, they're a different branch.

10:03.600 --> 10:08.800
 I mean, it's similar to when you talk about life, for instance, I mean, you kind of said life form,

10:08.800 --> 10:15.920
 I think, almost synonymously with intelligence, which I don't think is, you know, the AIs will

10:15.920 --> 10:22.240
 be upset to hear you equate those two things. Because I have really probably implied biological

10:22.240 --> 10:27.440
 life. Right. Right. Right. But you're saying, I mean, we'll explore this more, but you're saying

10:27.440 --> 10:34.480
 it's really a spectrum and it's all just a kind of computation. And so it's a full spectrum. And we

10:34.480 --> 10:40.480
 just make ourselves special by weaving a narrative around our particular kinds of computation.

10:40.480 --> 10:45.200
 Yes. I mean, the thing that I think I've kind of come to realize is, you know, at some level,

10:45.200 --> 10:50.880
 it's a little depressing to realize that there's so little or liberating. Well, yeah, but I mean,

10:50.880 --> 10:55.280
 it's, you know, it's the story of science, right? And, you know, from Copernicus on,

10:55.280 --> 11:00.160
 it's like, you know, first we were like convinced our planets at the center of the universe.

11:00.160 --> 11:04.160
 No, that's not true. Well, then we were convinced there's something very special about the chemistry

11:04.160 --> 11:10.240
 that we have as biological organisms. That's not really true. And then we're still holding out that

11:10.240 --> 11:16.160
 hope over this intelligence thing we have. That's really special. I don't think it is. However,

11:16.160 --> 11:21.120
 in a sense, as you say, it's kind of liberating for the following reason that you realize that

11:21.120 --> 11:30.480
 what's special is the details of us, not some abstract attribute that, you know, we could wonder,

11:30.480 --> 11:34.560
 oh, is something else going to come along and, you know, also have that abstract attribute?

11:35.200 --> 11:40.960
 Well, yes, every abstract attribute we have, something else has it. But the full details of

11:40.960 --> 11:46.720
 our kind of history of our civilization and so on, nothing else has that. That's what,

11:46.720 --> 11:52.000
 you know, that's our story, so to speak. And that's sort of almost by definition special.

11:52.560 --> 11:59.280
 So I view it as not being such a, I mean, initially I was like, this is bad. This is kind

11:59.280 --> 12:05.520
 of, you know, how can we have self respect about the things that we do? Then I realized the details

12:05.520 --> 12:09.840
 of the things we do, they are the story. Everything else is kind of a blank canvas.

12:09.840 --> 12:18.080
 So maybe on a small tangent, you just made me think of it, but what do you make of the monoliths

12:18.080 --> 12:26.800
 in 2001 Space Odyssey in terms of aliens communicating with us and sparking the kind of particular

12:26.800 --> 12:33.040
 intelligent computation that we humans have? Is there anything interesting to get from that

12:33.040 --> 12:40.400
 sci fi? Yeah, I mean, I think what's fun about that is, you know, the monoliths are these,

12:40.400 --> 12:46.560
 you know, one to four to nine perfect cuboid things. And in the, you know, Earth a million

12:46.560 --> 12:51.440
 years ago, whatever they were portraying with a bunch of apes and so on, a thing that has that

12:51.440 --> 12:58.960
 level of perfection seems out of place. It seems very kind of constructed, very engineered.

12:58.960 --> 13:04.080
 So that's an interesting question. What is the, you know, what's the techno signature, so to

13:04.080 --> 13:09.600
 speak? What is it that you see it somewhere and you say, my gosh, that had to be engineered?

13:10.800 --> 13:16.960
 Now, the fact is, we see crystals, which are also very perfect. And, you know, the perfect ones

13:16.960 --> 13:22.480
 are very perfect. They're nice polyhedral or whatever. And so in that sense, if you say, well,

13:22.480 --> 13:29.600
 it's a sign of sort of, it's a techno signature that it's a perfect, you know, a perfect polygonal

13:29.600 --> 13:36.720
 shape, polyhedral shape. That's not true. And so then it's an interesting question. What is the,

13:37.280 --> 13:41.840
 what is the right signature? I mean, like, you know, Gauss famous mathematician, you know,

13:41.840 --> 13:47.680
 he had this idea, you should cut down the Siberian forest and the shape of sort of a typical image

13:47.680 --> 13:52.640
 of the proof of the Pythagorean theorem on the grounds that is a kind of cool idea didn't get

13:52.640 --> 13:57.760
 done. But, you know, it was on the grounds that the Martians would see that and realize, gosh,

13:57.760 --> 14:02.960
 there are mathematicians out there. It's kind of, you know, it's the, in his theory of the world,

14:02.960 --> 14:08.960
 that was probably the best advertisement for the cultural achievements of our species. But, you

14:08.960 --> 14:16.480
 know, it's a reasonable question. What do you, what can you send or create that is a sign of

14:16.480 --> 14:20.800
 intelligence in its creation, or even intention in its creation?

14:20.800 --> 14:27.280
 Yeah, you talk about, if we were to send a beacon, can you, what should we send? Is math

14:27.280 --> 14:31.040
 our greatest creation? Is, what is our greatest creation?

14:31.040 --> 14:36.720
 I think, I think, and it's a, it's a philosophically doomed issue. I mean, in other words,

14:36.720 --> 14:42.720
 you send something, you think it's fantastic. But it's kind of like, we are part of the universe,

14:42.720 --> 14:48.080
 we make things that are, you know, things that happen in the universe. Computation,

14:48.080 --> 14:53.680
 which is sort of the thing that we are in some abstract sense, and sense using to create all

14:53.680 --> 15:01.120
 these elaborate things we create, is surprisingly ubiquitous. In other words, we might have thought

15:01.120 --> 15:06.880
 that, you know, we've built this whole giant engineering stack that's led us to microprocessors,

15:06.880 --> 15:13.200
 that's led us to be able to do elaborate computations. But this idea that computations

15:13.200 --> 15:17.600
 are happening all over the place. The only question is whether, whether there's a thread

15:17.600 --> 15:23.840
 that connects our human intentions to what those computations are. And so I think, I

15:23.840 --> 15:29.600
 think this question of what do you send to kind of show off our civilization in the best possible

15:29.600 --> 15:37.520
 way. I think any kind of almost random slab of stuff we've produced is about equivalence

15:37.520 --> 15:39.680
 to everything else. I think it's one of these things where

15:39.680 --> 15:45.280
 It's a non romantic way of phrasing it. I just, sorry to interrupt, but I just talked to

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
 Andrew Ian, who's the wife of Carl Sagan. And so I don't know if you're familiar with the

15:52.000 --> 15:59.280
 Voyager. I mean, she was part of sending, I think brainwaves of, you know, I want you to... Wasn't it hers?

15:59.280 --> 16:04.000
 It was hers. Her brainwaves when she was first falling in love with Carl Sagan, right? So this

16:04.000 --> 16:11.600
 beautiful story that perhaps you would shed down the power of that by saying we might as well

16:11.600 --> 16:16.800
 send anything else. And that's interesting. All of it is kind of an interesting, peculiar thing.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.280
 Yeah, yeah, right. Well, I mean, I think it's kind of interesting to see on the Voyager,

16:21.280 --> 16:25.680
 you know, golden record thing. One of the things that's kind of cute about that is, you know,

16:25.680 --> 16:31.760
 it was made, one was it in the late 70s, early 80s. And, you know, one of the things it's a

16:31.760 --> 16:37.760
 phonograph record. And it has a diagram of how to play a phonograph record. And, you know,

16:37.760 --> 16:43.680
 it's kind of like it's shocking that in just 30 years, if you show that to a random kid of today,

16:43.680 --> 16:47.520
 and you show them that diagram, I've tried this experiment, they're like, I don't know what the

16:47.520 --> 16:52.800
 heck this is. And the best anybody can think of is, you know, take the whole record, forget the

16:52.800 --> 16:57.520
 fact that it has some kind of helical track in it, just image the whole thing, and see what's

16:57.520 --> 17:03.520
 there. That's what we would do today. In only 30 years, our technology has kind of advanced to the

17:03.520 --> 17:09.440
 point where the playing of a helical, you know, mechanical track on a phonograph record is now

17:09.440 --> 17:15.120
 something bizarre. So, you know, it's, it's a that's a cautionary tale, I would say, in terms of

17:15.120 --> 17:22.320
 the ability to make something that in detail, sort of leads by the nose, some, you know,

17:22.320 --> 17:27.600
 the aliens or whatever, to do something, it's like, no, you know, best you're going to do,

17:27.600 --> 17:33.920
 as I say, if we were doing this today, we would not build a helical scan thing with a needle,

17:33.920 --> 17:38.480
 we would just take some high resolution imaging system, and get all the bits off it,

17:38.480 --> 17:43.120
 and say, oh, it's a big nuisance that they put in a helix, you know, in a spiral, let's

17:43.120 --> 17:49.120
 some, let's just, you know, unravel the spiral, and, and start from there.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.840
 Do you think, and this will get into trying to figure out

17:55.280 --> 17:59.520
 interpretability of AI, interpretability of computation, being able to communicate

18:00.480 --> 18:04.720
 with various kinds of computations, do you think it would be able to, if you're put,

18:04.720 --> 18:10.240
 put your alien hat on, figure out this record, how to play this record?

18:10.240 --> 18:13.920
 Well, it's a question of what one wants to do. I mean,

18:13.920 --> 18:19.760
 Understand what the other party was trying to communicate or understand anything about the

18:19.760 --> 18:23.600
 other party. What does understanding mean? I mean, that's the issue. The issue is,

18:23.600 --> 18:28.880
 it's like when people were trying to do natural language understanding for computers, right? So,

18:28.880 --> 18:34.880
 people tried to do that for years. It wasn't clear what it meant. In other words, you take

18:34.880 --> 18:40.480
 your piece of English or whatever, and you say, gosh, my computer has understood this. Okay,

18:40.480 --> 18:46.080
 that's nice. What can you do with that? Well, so for example, when we did, you know, Built

18:46.080 --> 18:52.160
 Wolf Malfur, you know, one of the things was, it's, you know, it's doing question answering and so on,

18:52.160 --> 18:57.520
 it needs to do natural language understanding. The reason that I realized after the fact,

18:57.520 --> 19:02.320
 the reason we were able to do natural language understanding quite well, and people hadn't

19:02.320 --> 19:07.520
 before, the number one thing was, we had an actual objective for the natural language

19:07.520 --> 19:10.960
 understanding, we were trying to turn the natural language into computation into this

19:10.960 --> 19:15.520
 computational language that we could then do things with. Now, similarly, when you imagine

19:15.520 --> 19:21.040
 your alien, you say, okay, we're playing them the record. Did they understand it? Well,

19:21.040 --> 19:25.520
 depends what you mean. If they, you know, if we, if there's a representation that they have,

19:25.520 --> 19:30.560
 if it converts to some representation, where we can say, Oh, yes, that is a, that's a

19:30.560 --> 19:36.800
 representation that we can recognize is represents understanding, then all well and good. But

19:36.800 --> 19:42.080
 actually the only ones that I think we can say would represent understanding are ones that will

19:42.080 --> 19:49.680
 then do things that we humans kind of recognize as being useful to us. Maybe try and understand,

19:50.320 --> 19:55.840
 quantify how technologically advanced this particular civilization is. So are they a threat

19:55.840 --> 20:01.760
 to us from a military perspective? Yeah, that's probably the kind of first kind of understanding

20:01.760 --> 20:06.000
 that will be interested in. Gosh, that's so hard. I mean, that's like in the arrival movie,

20:06.000 --> 20:10.720
 that was sort of one of the key questions is, is, you know, why are you here, so to speak?

20:10.720 --> 20:14.640
 And it's, are you going to hurt us? Right. But, but even that is, you know,

20:14.640 --> 20:18.480
 it's a very unclear, you know, it's like, the, are you going to hurt us? That comes back to a

20:18.480 --> 20:24.000
 lot of interesting AI ethics questions, because the, you know, we might make an AI that says,

20:24.000 --> 20:28.480
 well, take autonomous cars, for instance, you know, are you going to hurt us? Well,

20:28.480 --> 20:32.080
 let's make sure you only drive it precisely to the speed limit, because we want to make sure

20:32.080 --> 20:36.560
 we don't hurt you, so to speak, because that's some, and then well, something, you know, but

20:36.560 --> 20:40.000
 you say, but actually that means I'm going to be really late for this thing. And, you know,

20:40.000 --> 20:46.160
 that sort of hurts me in some way. So it's hard to know even, even the definition of what it means

20:46.160 --> 20:54.240
 to hurt someone is unclear. And as we start thinking about things about AI ethics and so on,

20:54.240 --> 20:58.800
 that's, you know, something one has to address. There's always tradeoffs. And that's the annoying

20:58.800 --> 21:03.200
 thing about ethics. Yeah, well, right. And I mean, I think ethics, like these other things

21:03.200 --> 21:09.040
 we're talking about, is a deeply human thing. There's no abstract, you know, let's write down

21:09.040 --> 21:15.280
 the theorem that proves that this is ethically correct. That's a, that's a meaningless idea.

21:15.280 --> 21:20.480
 You know, you have to have a ground truth, so to speak, that's ultimately sort of what

21:20.480 --> 21:25.440
 humans want. And they don't all want the same thing. So that gives one all kinds of additional

21:25.440 --> 21:30.480
 complexity and thinking about that. One convenient thing in terms of turning ethics

21:30.480 --> 21:36.640
 into computation, you can ask the question of what maximizes the likelihood of the survival of the

21:36.640 --> 21:44.320
 species? Yeah, that's a good existential issue. But then when you say survival of the species,

21:44.320 --> 21:51.280
 right, you might say, you might, for example, for example, let's say, forget about technology,

21:51.280 --> 21:56.800
 just, you know, hang out and, you know, be happy, live our lives, go on to the next generation,

21:56.800 --> 22:00.880
 you know, go through many, many generations, where in a sense, nothing is happening.

22:01.680 --> 22:08.160
 That okay? Is that not okay? Hard to know. In terms of, you know, the, the attempt to do

22:08.160 --> 22:15.040
 elaborate things and the attempt to might be counterproductive for the survival of the species.

22:15.600 --> 22:20.560
 Like for instance, I mean, in, you know, I think it's, it's also a little bit hard to know. So,

22:20.560 --> 22:25.520
 okay, let's take that as a, as a sort of thought experiment. Okay. You know, you can say, well,

22:26.880 --> 22:31.120
 what are the threats that we might have to survive? You know, the super volcano, the

22:31.120 --> 22:37.440
 asteroid impact, the, you know, all these kinds of things. Okay, so now we inventory these possible

22:37.440 --> 22:42.240
 threats and we say, let's make our species as robust as possible relative to all these threats.

22:42.800 --> 22:50.240
 I think in the end, it's a, it's sort of an unknowable thing, what, what it takes to, you know,

22:50.240 --> 22:57.680
 so, so given that you've got this AI, and you've told it, maximize the long term, what does long

22:57.680 --> 23:02.720
 term mean? Does long term mean until the sun burns out? That's, that's not going to work.

23:02.720 --> 23:08.640
 And, you know, does long term mean next 1000 years? Okay, there are probably optimizations

23:08.640 --> 23:13.520
 for the next 1000 years that are, it's like, it's like, if you're running a company, you

23:13.520 --> 23:18.400
 can make a company be very stable for a certain period of time. Like if, you know, if your company

23:18.400 --> 23:24.640
 gets bought by some, you know, private investment group, then they'll, you know, you can, you can

23:24.640 --> 23:30.000
 run a company just fine for five years by just taking what it does and, you know, removing all

23:30.000 --> 23:36.560
 R&D and the company will burn out after a while, but it'll run just fine for a while. So if you

23:36.560 --> 23:41.520
 tell the AI, keep the humans okay for 1000 years, there's probably a certain set of things that one

23:41.520 --> 23:46.240
 would do to optimize that, many of which one might say, well, that would be a pretty big shame for

23:46.240 --> 23:50.560
 the future of history, so to speak, for that to be what happens. But I think, I think in the end,

23:50.560 --> 23:57.680
 you know, as you start thinking about that question, it is what you realize is there's a whole sort of

23:57.680 --> 24:03.680
 raft of undecidability, computational irreducibility. In other words, it's, I mean, one of the good

24:03.680 --> 24:11.440
 things about sort of what our civilization has gone through and what sort of we humans go through

24:11.440 --> 24:15.520
 is that there's a certain computational irreducibility to it in the sense that

24:15.520 --> 24:19.280
 it isn't the case that you can look from the outside and just say, the answer is going to be

24:19.280 --> 24:23.600
 this. At the end of the day, this is what's going to happen. You actually have to go through the

24:23.600 --> 24:29.920
 process to find out. And I think that's, that's both, that feels better in the sense it's not a,

24:29.920 --> 24:36.880
 you know, something is achieved by going through all of this, all of this process. And it's,

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
 but it also means that telling the AI, go figure out, you know, what will be the best outcome.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.160
 Well, unfortunately, it's going to come back and say it's kind of undecidable what to do.

24:48.160 --> 24:54.160
 We'd have to run all of those scenarios to see what happens. And if we want it for the infinite

24:54.160 --> 25:00.240
 future, we're thrown immediately into sort of standard issues of kind of infinite computation

25:00.240 --> 25:04.960
 and so on. So yeah, even if you get that the answer to the universe and everything is 42,

25:04.960 --> 25:12.080
 you still have to actually run the universe. Yes. To figure out. Yes. Like the question,

25:12.080 --> 25:18.800
 I guess, or the, you know, the journey is the point. Right. Well, I think it's saying, to

25:18.800 --> 25:25.360
 summarize, this is the result of the universe. Yeah. That's, if that is possible, it tells us,

25:25.360 --> 25:30.240
 I mean, the whole sort of structure of thinking about computation and so on, and thinking about

25:30.240 --> 25:36.560
 how stuff works. If it's possible to say, and the answer is such and such, you're basically

25:36.560 --> 25:41.040
 saying there's a way of going outside the universe. And you're kind of, you're getting yourself into

25:41.040 --> 25:46.640
 something of a sort of paradox, because you're saying, if it's knowable, what the answer is,

25:46.640 --> 25:52.000
 then there's a way to know it that is beyond what the universe provides. But if we can know it,

25:52.560 --> 25:58.160
 then something that we're dealing with is beyond the universe. So then the universe isn't the

25:58.160 --> 26:06.640
 universe, so to speak. So. And in general, as we'll talk about, at least for small human brains,

26:06.640 --> 26:14.320
 it's hard to show that the result of a sufficiently complex computation. It's hard. I mean,

26:14.320 --> 26:23.360
 it's probably impossible, right? Undissidibility. So, and the universe appears by at least the

26:23.360 --> 26:29.440
 poets to be sufficiently complex, they won't be able to predict what the heck it's all going to.

26:30.160 --> 26:34.880
 Well, we better not be able to, because if we can, it kind of denies, I mean, it's, you know,

26:34.880 --> 26:39.840
 we're part of the universe. So what does it mean for us to predict? It means that we,

26:40.560 --> 26:46.080
 that our little part of the universe is able to jump ahead of the whole universe. And this quickly

26:47.120 --> 26:53.280
 winds up, I mean, that it is conceivable. The only way we'd be able to predict is if we are so

26:53.280 --> 26:58.800
 special in the universe, we are the one place where there is computation more special, more

26:58.800 --> 27:02.480
 sophisticated than anything else that exists in the universe. That's the only way we would

27:02.480 --> 27:08.560
 have the ability to sort of the almost theological ability, so to speak, to predict

27:09.280 --> 27:14.320
 what happens in the universe is to say somehow we're better than everything else in the universe,

27:14.320 --> 27:21.600
 which I don't think is the case. Yeah, perhaps we can detect a large number of looping patterns

27:22.320 --> 27:28.240
 that reoccur throughout the universe and fully describe them. And therefore, but then it's,

27:28.240 --> 27:32.800
 it still becomes exceptionally difficult to see how those patterns interact and what kind of

27:32.800 --> 27:37.040
 complexity measures. Well, look, the most remarkable thing about the universe is that

27:37.040 --> 27:43.440
 it's has regularity at all. Might not be the case. If you would have regularity, do you absolutely

27:43.440 --> 27:49.920
 that if it's full of, I mean, physics is successful, you know, it's full of, of laws that tell us a

27:49.920 --> 27:54.080
 lot of detail about how the universe works. I mean, it could be the case that, you know,

27:54.080 --> 27:58.080
 the 10 to the 90th particles in the universe, they will do their own thing, but they don't.

27:58.080 --> 28:03.360
 They all follow, we already know, they all follow basically physical, the same physical laws.

28:03.360 --> 28:09.440
 And that's something that's a very profound fact about the universe. What conclusion you draw from

28:09.440 --> 28:15.120
 that is unclear. I mean, in the, you know, the early, early theologians, that was, you know,

28:15.120 --> 28:20.240
 exhibit number one for the existence of God. Now, you know, people have different conclusions

28:20.240 --> 28:24.800
 about it. But the fact is, you know, right now, I mean, I happen to be interested,

28:24.800 --> 28:30.160
 actually, I've just restarted a long running kind of interest of mine about fundamental physics.

28:31.120 --> 28:36.720
 I'm kind of like, I'm on, I'm on a bit of a quest, which I'm about to make more public

28:37.440 --> 28:40.560
 to see if I can actually find the fundamental theory of physics.

28:40.560 --> 28:47.440
 Excellent. We'll come to that. And I just had a lot of conversations with quantum mechanics

28:47.440 --> 28:53.040
 folks with, so I'm really excited on your take, because I think you have a fascinating take on

28:53.040 --> 29:00.880
 the, the, the fundamental nature of our reality from a physics perspective. So, and what might be

29:00.880 --> 29:06.160
 underlying the kind of physics as we think of it today. Okay, let's take a step back.

29:06.800 --> 29:13.760
 What is computation? It's a good question. Operationally, computation is following rules.

29:15.120 --> 29:20.320
 That's kind of it. I mean, computation is the result is the process of systematically

29:20.320 --> 29:24.720
 following rules. And it is the thing that happens when you do that.

29:24.720 --> 29:30.720
 So taking initial conditions or taking inputs and following rules. I mean, what are you following

29:30.720 --> 29:36.320
 rules on? So there has to be some data, some, not necessarily, it can be something where

29:36.320 --> 29:42.080
 that there's a, you know, very simple input. And then you're following these rules. And you'd say

29:42.080 --> 29:47.040
 there's not really much data going into this. It's you can actually pack the initial conditions

29:47.040 --> 29:54.240
 into the rule, if you want to. So I think the question is, is there a robust notion of computation?

29:54.240 --> 29:57.520
 That is, what does it mean? What I mean by that is something like this. So,

29:57.520 --> 30:01.680
 so one of the things that are different in an area of physics, something like energy.

30:02.400 --> 30:08.640
 Okay, they're different forms of energy. There's, but somehow energy is a robust concept that

30:09.280 --> 30:15.920
 doesn't, isn't particular to kinetic energy or, you know, nuclear energy or whatever else,

30:15.920 --> 30:20.800
 there's a robust idea of energy. So one of the things you might ask is, is there a robust idea

30:20.800 --> 30:25.440
 of computation? Or does it matter that this computation is running in a Turing machine?

30:25.440 --> 30:31.280
 This computation is running in a, you know, CMOS silicon CPU. This computation is running in a

30:31.280 --> 30:36.160
 fluid system in the weather, those kinds of things. Or is there a robust idea of computation

30:36.160 --> 30:43.440
 that transcends the sort of detailed framework that it's running in? Okay. And is there? Yes.

30:43.440 --> 30:47.920
 I mean, it wasn't obvious that there was. So it's worth understanding the history

30:47.920 --> 30:52.480
 and how we got to where we are right now. Because, you know, to say that there is,

30:53.040 --> 30:59.120
 is a statement in part about our universe. It's not a statement about what is mathematically

30:59.120 --> 31:04.960
 conceivable. It's about what actually can exist for us. Maybe you can also comment,

31:04.960 --> 31:15.440
 because energy as a concept is robust. But there's also it's intricate, complicated relationship with

31:16.080 --> 31:24.240
 matter with mass is very interesting of particles that carry force and particles

31:25.280 --> 31:31.920
 that sort of particles that carry force and particles that have mass, these kinds of ideas,

31:31.920 --> 31:37.600
 they seem to map to each other, at least in the mathematical sense. Is there a connection between

31:38.160 --> 31:44.000
 energy and mass and computation? Or are these completely disjoint ideas?

31:44.000 --> 31:47.680
 We don't know yet. The things that I'm trying to do about fundamental physics

31:49.840 --> 31:54.720
 may well lead to such a connection, but there is no known connection at this time.

31:54.720 --> 31:59.520
 So, can you elaborate a little bit more on what, how do you think about

31:59.520 --> 32:05.040
 computation? What is computation? Yeah. So, I mean, let's, let's tell a little bit of a historical

32:05.040 --> 32:11.120
 story. Okay. So, you know, back, go back 150 years, people were making mechanical

32:12.160 --> 32:16.480
 calculators of various kinds. And, you know, the typical thing was you want an adding machine,

32:16.480 --> 32:20.480
 you go to the adding machine store, basically, you want a multiplying machine, you go to the

32:20.480 --> 32:25.440
 multiplying machine store, they're different pieces of hardware. And so that means that,

32:25.440 --> 32:29.920
 at least at the level of that kind of computation, and those kinds of pieces of hardware,

32:29.920 --> 32:34.080
 there isn't a robust notion of computation. There's the adding machine kind of computation,

32:34.080 --> 32:39.680
 there's the multiplying machine comp notion of computation, and they're disjoint. So, what happened

32:39.680 --> 32:44.800
 in around 1900, people started imagining, particularly in the context of mathematical logic,

32:44.800 --> 32:51.040
 could you have something which would be represent any reasonable function, right? And they came up

32:51.040 --> 32:56.320
 with things, this idea of primitive recursion was one of the early ideas. And it didn't work.

32:56.320 --> 33:01.440
 There were reasonable functions that people could come up with that were not represented

33:01.440 --> 33:07.360
 using the primitives of primitive recursion. Okay. So, then, then along comes 1931 and

33:07.360 --> 33:14.720
 Goedl's theorem and so on. And as in looking back, one can see that as part of the process of

33:14.720 --> 33:20.080
 establishing Goedl's theorem, Goedl basically showed how you could compile arithmetic,

33:20.080 --> 33:26.160
 how you could basically compile logical statements like this statement is unprovable

33:26.160 --> 33:33.520
 into arithmetic. So, what he essentially did was to show that arithmetic can be a computer,

33:33.520 --> 33:37.600
 in a sense, that's capable of representing all kinds of other things. And then,

33:37.600 --> 33:42.640
 Turing came along 1936, came up with Turing machines. Meanwhile, Alonzo Church had come

33:42.640 --> 33:47.360
 up with lambda calculus. And the surprising thing that was established very quickly is

33:47.360 --> 33:52.720
 the Turing machine idea about what computation might be is exactly the same as the lambda

33:52.720 --> 33:58.240
 calculus idea of what computation might be. And so, and then there started to be other ideas,

33:58.240 --> 34:04.800
 register machines, other kinds of representations of computation. And the big surprise was,

34:04.800 --> 34:08.560
 they all turned out to be equivalent. So, in other words, it might have been the case,

34:08.560 --> 34:13.360
 like those old adding machines and multiplying machines, that Turing had his idea of computation,

34:13.360 --> 34:18.160
 Church had his idea of computation, and they were just different. But it isn't true. They're

34:18.160 --> 34:27.840
 actually all equivalent. So then, by, I would say, the 1970s or so, in sort of the computer

34:27.840 --> 34:32.160
 science, computation theory area, people had sort of said, oh, Turing machines are kind of what

34:32.160 --> 34:37.440
 computation is. Physicists were still holding out saying, no, no, no, it's just not how the

34:37.440 --> 34:41.760
 universe works. We've got all these differential equations. We've got all these real numbers

34:41.760 --> 34:45.200
 that have infinite numbers of digits. The universe is not a Turing machine.

34:45.200 --> 34:52.400
 Right. The Turing machines are a small subset of the things that we make in microprocessors

34:52.400 --> 34:58.640
 and engineering structures and so on. So probably, actually, through my work in the 1980s about sort

34:58.640 --> 35:06.080
 of the relationship between computation and models of physics, it became a little less clear

35:06.080 --> 35:13.040
 that there would be, that there was this big sort of dichotomy between what can happen in physics

35:13.040 --> 35:16.480
 and what happens in things like Turing machines. And I think probably by now,

35:17.600 --> 35:23.040
 people would mostly think, and by the way, brains were another kind of element of this. I mean,

35:23.040 --> 35:27.520
 you know, Goedl didn't think that his notion of computation or what amounted to his notion of

35:27.520 --> 35:35.280
 computation would cover brains. And Turing wasn't sure either. But although he was a little bit,

35:35.280 --> 35:43.680
 he got to be a little bit more convinced that it should cover brains. But so I would say by

35:43.680 --> 35:48.720
 probably sometime in the 1980s, there was beginning to be sort of a general belief that, yes, this

35:48.720 --> 35:54.400
 notion of computation that could be captured by things like Turing machines was reasonably robust.

35:54.960 --> 36:01.840
 Now, the next question is, okay, you can have a universal Turing machine that's capable of

36:01.840 --> 36:08.320
 being programmed to do anything that any Turing machine can do. And, you know, this idea of

36:08.320 --> 36:12.960
 universal computation, it's an important idea, this idea that you can have one piece of hardware

36:12.960 --> 36:17.760
 and program it with different pieces of software. You know, that's kind of the idea that launched

36:17.760 --> 36:21.600
 most modern technology. I mean, that's kind of that that's the idea that launched computer

36:21.600 --> 36:28.240
 evolution, software, etc. So important idea. But but the thing that's still kind of holding out

36:28.240 --> 36:35.120
 from that idea is, okay, there is this universal computation thing, but seems hard to get to.

36:35.120 --> 36:40.000
 It seems like you want to make a universal computer, you have to kind of have a microprocessor with,

36:40.000 --> 36:44.800
 you know, a million gates in it, and you have to go to a lot of trouble to make something that

36:44.800 --> 36:51.680
 achieves that level of computational sophistication. Okay, so the surprise for me was the stuff that

36:51.680 --> 36:56.960
 I discovered in the early 80s, I'm looking at these things called cellular automata,

36:56.960 --> 37:03.360
 which are really simple computational systems. The thing that was a big surprise to me was

37:03.360 --> 37:07.200
 that even when their rules were very, very simple, they were doing things that were as

37:07.200 --> 37:11.920
 sophisticated as they did when their rules were much more complicated. So it didn't look like,

37:11.920 --> 37:16.560
 you know, this idea, oh, to get sophisticated computation, you have to build something with

37:16.560 --> 37:23.440
 very sophisticated rules. That idea didn't seem to pan out. And instead, it seemed to be the case

37:23.440 --> 37:27.920
 that sophisticated computation was completely ubiquitous, even in systems with incredibly

37:27.920 --> 37:33.760
 simple rules. And so that led to this thing that I call the principle of computational equivalence,

37:33.760 --> 37:42.320
 which basically says when you have a system that follows rules of any kind, then whenever the system

37:42.320 --> 37:48.400
 isn't doing things that are in some sense, obviously simple, then the computation that

37:48.400 --> 37:54.240
 the behavior of the system corresponds to is of equivalent sophistication. So that means that

37:54.240 --> 37:58.800
 when you kind of go from the very, very, very simplest things you can imagine, then quite

37:58.800 --> 38:03.840
 quickly you hit this kind of threshold above which everything is equivalent in its computational

38:03.840 --> 38:09.520
 sophistication. Not obvious that would be the case. I mean, that's a science fact. Well,

38:09.520 --> 38:14.800
 no, no, no, hold on a second. So this you've opened with a new kind of science. I mean,

38:14.800 --> 38:22.320
 I remember it was a huge eye opener that such simple things can create such complexity. And

38:22.320 --> 38:28.240
 yes, there's an equivalence, but it's not a fact. It just appears to, I mean, as much as a fact as

38:28.240 --> 38:38.320
 sort of these theories are so elegant that it seems to be the way things are. But let me ask,

38:38.320 --> 38:44.400
 sort of, you just brought up previously kind of like the communities of computer scientists

38:44.400 --> 38:50.400
 with their Turing machines, the physicists with their universe, and the whoever the heck,

38:50.400 --> 38:57.360
 maybe neuroscientists looking at the brain. What's your sense in the equivalence? So you've shown

38:57.360 --> 39:06.560
 through your work that simple rules can create equivalently complex Turing machine systems,

39:06.560 --> 39:16.160
 right? Is the universe equivalent to the kinds of Turing machines? Is the human brain

39:17.520 --> 39:21.600
 a kind of Turing machine? Do you see those things basically blending together,

39:21.600 --> 39:25.120
 or is there still a mystery about how disjoint they are?

39:25.120 --> 39:30.080
 Well, my guess is that they all blend together. But we don't know that for sure yet. I mean,

39:30.080 --> 39:35.360
 this, you know, I should say, I said rather glibly that the principle of computational

39:35.360 --> 39:42.000
 equivalence is sort of a science fact. And I was using air quotes for the science fact.

39:42.000 --> 39:47.760
 Because when you, it is a, I mean, just to talk about that for a second, then we'll,

39:49.760 --> 39:57.200
 the thing is that it is, it has a complicated epistemological character, similar to things

39:57.200 --> 40:02.160
 like the second law of thermodynamics, the law of entropy increase. The, you know,

40:02.160 --> 40:07.120
 what is the second law of thermodynamics? Is it a law of nature? Is it a thing that is true

40:07.120 --> 40:12.240
 of the physical world? Is it, is it something which is mathematically provable? Is it something

40:12.240 --> 40:18.000
 which happens to be true of the systems that we see in the world? Is it in some sense a definition

40:18.000 --> 40:23.360
 of heat, perhaps? Well, it's a combination of those things. And it's the same thing with the

40:23.360 --> 40:27.520
 principle of computational equivalence. And in some sense, the principle of computational

40:27.520 --> 40:32.160
 equivalence is at the heart of the definition of computation. Because it's telling you,

40:32.160 --> 40:37.440
 there is a thing, there is a robust notion that is equivalent across all these systems,

40:37.440 --> 40:42.000
 and doesn't depend on the details of each individual system. And that's why we can

40:42.000 --> 40:46.800
 meaningfully talk about a thing called computation. And we're not stuck talking about,

40:46.800 --> 40:51.040
 oh, there's computation in Turing machine number three, seven, eight, five,

40:51.040 --> 40:55.440
 and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. That's that's why there is a robust notion like that.

40:55.440 --> 41:00.080
 Now, on the other hand, can we prove the principle of computational equivalence? Can we can we

41:00.080 --> 41:05.520
 prove it as a mathematical result? Well, the answer is, actually, we've got some nice results

41:05.520 --> 41:11.200
 along those lines that say, you know, throw me a random system with very simple rules. Well,

41:11.200 --> 41:17.280
 in a couple of cases, we now know that even the very simplest rules we can imagine of a certain

41:17.280 --> 41:23.280
 type are universal, and do sort of follow what you would expect from the principle of

41:23.280 --> 41:26.800
 computational equivalence. So that's a nice piece of sort of mathematical evidence

41:26.800 --> 41:28.720
 for the principle of computational equivalence.

41:28.720 --> 41:32.720
 Just to look on that point, the simple rules creating sort of these

41:34.080 --> 41:43.280
 complex behaviors. But is there a way to mathematically say that this behavior is complex

41:44.240 --> 41:46.960
 that you've you mentioned that you cross a threshold?

41:46.960 --> 41:51.600
 Right. So the various indicators. So for example, one thing would be,

41:51.600 --> 41:56.880
 is it capable of universal computation? That is, given the system, do there exist

41:56.880 --> 42:01.920
 initial conditions for the system that can be set up to essentially represent programs to do

42:01.920 --> 42:06.800
 anything you want to compute primes to compute pi to do whatever you want? Right. So that's an

42:06.800 --> 42:14.160
 indicator. So we know in a couple of examples that, yes, the simplest candidates that could

42:14.160 --> 42:17.920
 conceivably have that property do have that property. And that's what the principle of

42:17.920 --> 42:22.640
 computational equivalence might suggest. But this principle of computational equivalence,

42:23.840 --> 42:29.120
 one question about it is, is it true for the physical world? Right. It might be true for

42:29.120 --> 42:32.720
 all these things we come up with the Turing machines, the cellular automata, whatever else.

42:34.080 --> 42:39.920
 Is it true for our actual physical world? Is it true for the brain brains, which are an element

42:39.920 --> 42:45.440
 of the physical world? We don't know for sure. And that's not the type of question that we will

42:45.440 --> 42:51.680
 have a definitive answer to, because there's a sort of scientific induction issue. You can say,

42:51.680 --> 42:55.360
 well, it's true for all these brains. But this person over here is really special,

42:55.360 --> 43:01.840
 and it's not true for them. And the only way that that cannot be what happens is,

43:02.400 --> 43:08.320
 if we finally nail it and actually get a fundamental theory for physics, and it turns out to

43:08.320 --> 43:13.440
 correspond to, let's say, a simple program, if that is the case, then we will basically have

43:13.440 --> 43:18.720
 reduced physics to a branch of mathematics, in the sense that we will not be right now with

43:18.720 --> 43:24.400
 physics. We're like, well, this is the theory that this is the rules that apply here. But in the

43:24.400 --> 43:31.520
 middle of that, right by that black hole, maybe these rules don't apply and something else applies,

43:31.520 --> 43:36.640
 and there may be another piece of the onion that we have to peel back. But if we can get to the

43:36.640 --> 43:41.520
 point where we actually have, this is the fundamental theory of physics, here it is,

43:41.520 --> 43:47.520
 it's this program, run this program, and you will get our universe, then we've kind of reduced the

43:47.520 --> 43:53.040
 problem of figuring out things in physics to a problem of doing some what turns out to be very

43:53.040 --> 43:58.560
 difficult, irreducibly difficult mathematical problems. But it no longer is the case that we

43:58.560 --> 44:03.200
 can say that somebody can come in and say, whoops, you will write about all these things about

44:03.200 --> 44:07.360
 Turing machines, but you're wrong about the physical universe. We know there's sort of

44:07.360 --> 44:11.600
 ground truth about what's happening in the physical universe. Now, I happen to think,

44:11.600 --> 44:15.440
 I mean, you asked me at an interesting time, because I'm just in the middle of starting to

44:16.640 --> 44:21.840
 reenergize my project to kind of study the fundamental theory of physics.

44:23.040 --> 44:27.760
 As of today, I'm very optimistic that we're actually going to find something and that it's

44:27.760 --> 44:32.560
 going to be possible to see that the universe really is computational in that sense. But I

44:32.560 --> 44:40.240
 don't know because we're betting against the universe, so to speak. And it's not like when

44:40.240 --> 44:46.720
 I spend a lot of my life building technology, and then I know what's in there. And it may have

44:46.720 --> 44:50.160
 unexpected behavior, it may have bugs, things like that. But fundamentally, I know what's in there.

44:50.160 --> 44:53.200
 For the universe, I'm not in that position, so to speak.

44:54.720 --> 45:01.440
 What kind of computation do you think the fundamental laws of physics might emerge from?

45:01.440 --> 45:08.480
 So just to clarify, you've done a lot of fascinating work with kind of discrete

45:08.480 --> 45:13.920
 kinds of computation that, you know, you could sell your automata, and we'll talk about it,

45:14.720 --> 45:19.680
 have this very clean structure. It's such a nice way to demonstrate that simple rules

45:20.320 --> 45:27.520
 can create immense complexity. But what kind, you know, is that actually,

45:27.520 --> 45:33.040
 are cellular automata sufficiently general to describe the kinds of computation that might

45:33.040 --> 45:38.080
 create the laws of physics? Just to give, can you give a sense of what kind of computation do you

45:38.080 --> 45:44.160
 think would create? Well, so this is a slightly complicated issue, because as soon as you have

45:44.160 --> 45:49.600
 universal computation, you can in principle simulate anything with anything. But it is not a

45:49.600 --> 45:55.520
 natural thing to do. And if you're asking, were you to try to find our physical universe

45:55.520 --> 45:59.600
 by looking at possible programs in the computational universe of all possible programs,

46:00.240 --> 46:06.240
 would the ones that correspond to our universe be small and simple enough that we might find them

46:06.240 --> 46:10.640
 by searching that computational universe? We've got to have the right basis, so to speak. We have

46:10.640 --> 46:15.760
 got to have the right language in effect for describing computation for that to be feasible.

46:15.760 --> 46:19.040
 So the thing that I've been interested in for a long time is, what are the most

46:19.040 --> 46:24.160
 structural structures that we can create with computation? So in other words, if you say a

46:24.160 --> 46:31.040
 cellular automaton, it has a bunch of cells that are arrayed on a grid, and every cell is updated

46:31.040 --> 46:37.440
 in synchrony at a particular, when there's a click of a clock, so to speak, and it goes a tick

46:37.440 --> 46:43.120
 of a clock, and every cell gets updated at the same time. That's a very specific, very rigid

46:43.120 --> 46:49.200
 kind of thing. But my guess is that when we look at physics, and we look at things like space and

46:49.200 --> 46:55.440
 time, that what's underneath space and time is something as structural as possible, that what

46:55.440 --> 47:01.920
 we see, what emerges for us as physical space, for example, comes from something that is sort of

47:01.920 --> 47:08.320
 arbitrarily unstructured underneath. And so I've been for a long time interested in kind of what

47:08.320 --> 47:14.160
 are the most structural structures that we can set up. And actually, what I had thought about

47:14.160 --> 47:19.920
 for ages is using graphs, networks, where essentially, so let's talk about space, for

47:19.920 --> 47:26.560
 example. So what is space? As a kind of a question one might ask, back in the early days of quantum

47:26.560 --> 47:31.280
 mechanics, for example, people said, Oh, for sure, space is going to be discreet, because all these

47:31.280 --> 47:35.600
 other things we're finding are discreet. But that never worked out in physics. And so space and

47:35.600 --> 47:41.040
 physics today is always treated as this continuous thing, just like Euclid imagined it. I mean,

47:41.040 --> 47:46.480
 the very first thing Euclid says in his sort of common notions is, a point is something which

47:46.480 --> 47:52.560
 has no part. In other words, there are points that are arbitrarily small. And there's a continuum

47:52.560 --> 47:57.920
 of possible positions of points. And the question is, is that true? And so, for example, if we look

47:57.920 --> 48:02.560
 at, I don't know, fluid like air or water, we might say, Oh, it's a continuous fluid, we can

48:02.560 --> 48:06.560
 pour it, we can do all kinds of things continuously. But actually, we know, because we know the

48:06.560 --> 48:10.560
 physics of it, that it consists of a bunch of discrete molecules bouncing around and only in

48:10.560 --> 48:16.400
 the aggregate is it behaving like a continuum. And so the possibility exists that that's true

48:16.400 --> 48:21.200
 of space too. People haven't managed to make that work with existing frameworks and physics.

48:22.320 --> 48:28.640
 But I've been interested in whether one can imagine that underneath space and also underneath time

48:28.640 --> 48:34.560
 is something more structuralist. And the question is, is it computational? So there are a couple

48:34.560 --> 48:38.480
 of possibilities. It could be computational, somehow fundamentally equivalent to a Turing

48:38.480 --> 48:44.000
 machine. Or it could be fundamentally not. So how could it not be? It could not be. So a Turing

48:44.000 --> 48:49.120
 machine essentially deals with integers, whole numbers, some level. And, you know, it can do

48:49.120 --> 48:54.000
 things like it can add one to a number, it can do things like this. It can also store whatever

48:54.000 --> 49:01.280
 the heck it did. Yes, it can have an infinite storage. But what, when one thinks about doing

49:01.280 --> 49:08.320
 physics or sort of idealized physics or idealized mathematics, one can deal with real numbers,

49:08.320 --> 49:12.960
 numbers with an infinite number of digits, numbers which are absolutely precise. And

49:12.960 --> 49:16.240
 one can say, we can take this number and we can multiply it by itself.

49:16.240 --> 49:21.040
 Are you comfortable with infinity in this context? Are you comfortable in the context of

49:21.040 --> 49:26.640
 computation? Do you think infinity plays a part? I think that the role of infinity is complicated.

49:26.640 --> 49:34.080
 Infinity is useful in conceptualizing things. It's not actualizable. Almost by definition,

49:34.080 --> 49:38.720
 it's not actualizable. But do you think infinity is part of the thing that might underlie the

49:38.720 --> 49:45.440
 laws of physics? I think that, no. I think there are many questions that you might ask about

49:45.440 --> 49:49.760
 physics which inevitably involve infinity. Like when you say, you know, is faster than

49:49.760 --> 49:56.080
 light travel possible? You could say, given the laws of physics, can you make something?

49:56.080 --> 50:02.400
 Even arbitrarily large, even quote, infinitely large, that will make faster than light travel

50:02.400 --> 50:07.440
 possible. Then you're thrown into dealing with infinity as a kind of theoretical question.

50:07.440 --> 50:14.560
 But I mean, talking about what's underneath space and time and how one can make a computational

50:14.560 --> 50:20.160
 infrastructure, one possibility is that you can't make a computational infrastructure

50:20.160 --> 50:25.440
 during machine sense. That you really have to be dealing with precise real numbers.

50:25.440 --> 50:31.280
 You're dealing with partial differential equations which just have precise real numbers at arbitrarily

50:31.280 --> 50:36.960
 closely separated points. You have a continuum for everything. Could be that that's what happens,

50:36.960 --> 50:40.720
 that there's sort of a continuum for everything and precise real numbers for everything. And then

50:40.720 --> 50:47.680
 the things I'm thinking about are wrong. And that's the risk you take if you're trying to

50:47.680 --> 50:53.280
 sort of do things about nature is you might just be wrong. It's not, for me personally,

50:53.280 --> 50:57.440
 it's kind of a strange thing because I've spent a lot of my life building technology

50:57.440 --> 51:02.880
 where you can do something that nobody cares about, but you can't be sort of wrong in that sense,

51:02.880 --> 51:07.440
 in the sense you build your technology and it does what it does. But I think this question of

51:08.720 --> 51:12.000
 what the sort of underlying computational infrastructure for the universe might be,

51:13.280 --> 51:20.400
 it's sort of inevitable it's going to be fairly abstract because if you're going to get all these

51:20.400 --> 51:24.240
 things like there are three dimensions of space, there are electrons, there are muons, there are

51:24.240 --> 51:30.320
 quarks, there are this, you don't get to, if the model for the universe is simple, you don't get

51:30.320 --> 51:36.480
 to have sort of a line of code for each of those things. You don't get to have sort of the muon

51:36.480 --> 51:40.720
 case, the tau lepton case and so on. All of those things have to be emergent somehow.

51:40.720 --> 51:45.760
 Right. Something deeper. Right. So that means it's sort of inevitable that's a little hard to

51:45.760 --> 51:52.480
 talk about what the sort of underlying structuralist structure actually is. Do you think our human

51:52.480 --> 51:58.320
 beings have the cognitive capacity to understand, if we're to discover it, to understand the kinds

51:58.320 --> 52:04.160
 of simple structure from which these laws can emerge? Do you think that's a hopeless pursuit?

52:04.160 --> 52:08.800
 Well, here's what I think. I think that, I mean, I'm right in the middle of this right now. So I'm

52:08.800 --> 52:15.680
 telling you that this human has a hard time understanding a bunch of the things

52:15.680 --> 52:21.200
 that are going on. But what happens in understanding is one builds waypoints. I mean, if you said

52:21.200 --> 52:29.600
 understand modern 21st century mathematics starting from counting back in whenever counting was

52:29.600 --> 52:35.440
 invented 50,000 years ago, whatever it was, that will be really difficult. But what happens is we

52:35.440 --> 52:40.080
 build waypoints that allow us to get to high levels of understanding. And we see the same thing

52:40.080 --> 52:45.520
 happening in language. When we invent a word for something, it provides kind of a cognitive

52:45.520 --> 52:51.680
 anchor, a kind of a waypoint that lets us like a podcast or something. You could be explaining,

52:51.680 --> 52:56.480
 well, it's a thing which works this way, that way, the other way. But as soon as you have the word

52:56.480 --> 53:02.320
 podcast, and people kind of societally understand it, you start to be able to build on top of that.

53:02.320 --> 53:06.800
 And so I think, and that's kind of the story of science actually too. I mean, science is about

53:06.800 --> 53:12.880
 building these kind of waypoints where we find this sort of cognitive mechanism for understanding

53:12.880 --> 53:17.120
 something. Then we can build on top of it. We have the idea of, I don't know, differential

53:17.120 --> 53:23.600
 equations, we can build on top of that. We have this idea, that idea. So my hope is that if it

53:23.600 --> 53:29.200
 is the case that we have to go all the way sort of from the sand to the computer, and there's no

53:29.200 --> 53:35.200
 waypoints in between, then we're toast. We won't be able to do that. Well, eventually we might.

53:35.200 --> 53:41.440
 So if we're, as clever apes are good enough for building those abstractions, eventually from sand

53:41.440 --> 53:44.640
 we'll get to the computer, right? And it's just might be a longer journey.

53:44.640 --> 53:48.560
 The question is whether it is something that you ask whether our human brains

53:49.360 --> 53:54.800
 will understand what's going on. And that's a different question, because for that,

53:54.800 --> 54:02.320
 it requires steps that are sort of from which we can construct a human understandable narrative.

54:02.320 --> 54:08.800
 And that's something that I think I am somewhat hopeful that that will be possible. Although,

54:08.800 --> 54:14.080
 you know, as of literally today, if you ask me, I'm confronted with things that I don't understand

54:14.080 --> 54:20.800
 very well. So this is a small pattern in a computation trying to understand the rules

54:20.800 --> 54:27.280
 under which the computation functions. And it's an interesting possibility under which kinds of

54:27.280 --> 54:34.080
 computations such a creature can't understand itself. My guess is that within, so we didn't

54:34.080 --> 54:37.840
 talk much about computational irreducibility, but it's a consequence of this principle of

54:37.840 --> 54:42.240
 computational equivalence. And it's sort of a core idea that one has to understand, I think,

54:42.240 --> 54:47.120
 which is the question is, you're doing a computation, you can figure out what happens in

54:47.120 --> 54:50.640
 the computation just by running every step in the computation and seeing what happens.

54:51.360 --> 54:56.880
 Or you can say, let me jump ahead and figure out, you know, have something smarter that

54:56.880 --> 55:02.320
 figures out what's going to happen before it actually happens. And a lot of traditional science

55:02.320 --> 55:08.720
 has been about that act of computational reducibility. It's like, we've got these equations,

55:08.720 --> 55:12.400
 and we can just solve them, and we can figure out what's going to happen. We don't have to trace

55:12.400 --> 55:17.200
 all of those steps, we just jump ahead because we solved these equations. Okay, so one of the

55:17.200 --> 55:20.800
 things that is a consequence of the principle of computational equivalence is you don't always get

55:20.800 --> 55:26.320
 to do that. Many, many systems will be computationally irreducible, in the sense that the only way

55:26.320 --> 55:30.560
 to find out what they do is just follow each step and see what happens. Why is that? Well,

55:30.560 --> 55:36.320
 if you're saying, well, we, with our brains, we're a lot smarter, we don't have to mess around like

55:36.320 --> 55:41.120
 the little cellular automaton going through and updating all those cells, we can just, you know,

55:41.120 --> 55:46.080
 use the power of our brains to jump ahead. But if the principle of computational equivalence is

55:46.080 --> 55:52.400
 right, that's not going to be correct, because it means that there's us doing our computation in

55:52.400 --> 55:56.800
 our brains, there's a little cellular automaton doing its computation. And the principle of

55:56.800 --> 56:02.320
 computational equivalence says these two computations are fundamentally equivalent. So that means

56:02.320 --> 56:06.080
 we don't get to say we're a lot smarter than the cellular automaton and jump ahead,

56:06.080 --> 56:10.640
 because we're just doing computation that's of the same sophistication as the cellular automaton

56:10.640 --> 56:15.680
 itself. That's computation or reducibility. It's fascinating. But the, and that's a really

56:15.680 --> 56:22.960
 powerful idea. I think that's both depressing and humbling and so on, that we're all, we in a

56:22.960 --> 56:27.360
 cellular automaton are the same. But the question we're talking about the fundamental laws of physics

56:28.080 --> 56:32.560
 is kind of the reverse question. You're not predicting what's going to happen. You have to

56:32.560 --> 56:38.160
 run the universe for that. But saying, can I understand what rules likely generated me?

56:38.160 --> 56:44.320
 I understand. But the problem is, to know whether you're right, you have to have some

56:44.320 --> 56:48.720
 computational reducibility, because we are embedded in the universe. If the only way to

56:48.720 --> 56:53.120
 know whether we get the universe is just to run the universe, we don't get to do that because it

56:53.120 --> 56:58.560
 just ran for 14.6 billion years or whatever. And we don't, you know, we can't rerun it, so to speak.

56:58.560 --> 57:04.240
 So we have to hope that there are pockets of computational reducibility sufficient to be

57:04.240 --> 57:10.560
 able to say, yes, I can recognize those are electrons there. And I think that it is a feature

57:10.560 --> 57:14.800
 of computational irreducibility. It's sort of a mathematical feature that there are always an

57:14.800 --> 57:19.280
 infinite collection of pockets of reducibility. The question of whether they land in the right

57:19.280 --> 57:24.080
 place and whether we can sort of build a theory based on them is unclear. But to this point about,

57:24.640 --> 57:29.680
 you know, whether we as observers in the universe built out of the same stuff as the universe

57:29.680 --> 57:35.840
 can figure out the universe, so to speak, that relies on these pockets of reducibility. Without

57:35.840 --> 57:41.680
 the pockets of reducibility, it won't work, can't work. But I think this question about how observers

57:41.680 --> 57:47.920
 operate, it's one of the features of science over the last 100 years, particularly, has been

57:47.920 --> 57:52.960
 that every time we get more realistic about observers, we learn a bit more about science.

57:52.960 --> 57:58.960
 So for example, relativity was all about observers don't get to say when, you know,

57:58.960 --> 58:03.200
 what's simultaneous with what they have to just wait for the light signal to arrive to decide

58:03.200 --> 58:08.960
 what's simultaneous. Or for example, in thermodynamics, observers don't get to say the

58:08.960 --> 58:14.320
 position of every single molecule in a gas, they can only see the kind of large scale features,

58:14.320 --> 58:19.040
 and that's why the second law of thermodynamics law of entropy increase and so on works. If you

58:19.040 --> 58:25.920
 could see every individual molecule, you wouldn't conclude something about thermodynamics, you would

58:25.920 --> 58:30.000
 conclude, oh, these molecules just all doing these particular things, you wouldn't be able to see this

58:30.000 --> 58:35.840
 aggregate fact. So I strongly expect that, and in fact, in the theories that I have,

58:35.840 --> 58:42.800
 that one has to be more realistic about the computation and other aspects of observers

58:42.800 --> 58:47.200
 in order to actually make a correspondence between what we experience. In fact, they have a

58:47.920 --> 58:53.120
 my little team and I have a little theory right now about how quantum mechanics may work, which is

58:53.120 --> 59:01.200
 a very wonderfully bizarre idea about how sort of thread of human consciousness relates to

59:01.200 --> 59:06.000
 what we observe in the universe, but this is the several steps to explain what that's about.

59:06.000 --> 59:12.240
 What do you make of the mess of the observer at the lower level of quantum mechanics? Sort of the

59:12.240 --> 59:22.240
 textbook definition with quantum mechanics kind of says that there's two worlds. One is the world

59:22.240 --> 59:29.280
 that actually is, and the other is that's observed. What do you make sense of that?

59:29.280 --> 59:35.600
 Well, I think actually the ideas we've recently had might actually give away into this,

59:36.480 --> 59:43.840
 and that's, I don't know yet. I mean, it's, I think that's, it's a mess. I mean, the fact is,

59:43.840 --> 59:49.600
 there is a, one of the things that's interesting, and when, you know, people look at these models

59:49.600 --> 59:54.160
 that I started talking about 30 years ago now, they say, oh, no, that can't possibly be right.

59:54.160 --> 59:59.520
 You know, what about quantum mechanics? Right? You say, okay, tell me what is the essence of

59:59.520 --> 1:00:03.440
 quantum mechanics? What do you want me to be able to reproduce to know that I've got quantum

1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:08.400
 mechanics, so to speak? Well, and that question comes up, comes up very operationally, actually,

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:12.000
 because we've been doing a bunch of stuff with quantum computing. And there are all these companies

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:17.280
 that say, we have a quantum computer, and we say, let's connect to your API, and let's actually run

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:23.040
 it. And they're like, well, maybe you shouldn't do that yet. We're not quite ready yet. And one of

1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:27.600
 the questions that I've been curious about is, if I have five minutes with a quantum computer,

1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:32.000
 how can I tell if it's really a quantum computer, or whether it's a simulator at the other end?

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.320
 Right? And turns out it's really hard. It turns out there isn't, it's, it's, it's like a lot of

1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:41.440
 these questions about sort of what is intelligence, what's life. That's a scoring test for quantum

1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:45.920
 computer. That's right. That's right. It's like, are you really a quantum computer? And I think

1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:51.200
 the simulation, the, yes, exactly. Is it just a simulation? Or is it really a quantum computer?

1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:57.280
 Same issue all over again. But that, so, you know, this, this whole issue about

1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:01.920
 the sort of mathematical structure of quantum mechanics, and the completely separate

1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:08.480
 thing that is our experience in which we think definite things happen, whereas quantum mechanics

1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:12.400
 doesn't say definite things ever happen. Quantum mechanics is all about the amplitudes for

1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:19.520
 different things to happen. But yet, our thread of consciousness operates as if definite things

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:27.040
 are happening. But to link on the point, you've kind of mentioned the structure that could

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:32.720
 underlie everything and this idea that it could perhaps have something like a structure of a

1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:39.280
 graph. Can you elaborate why your intuition is that there's a graph structure of nodes and edges

1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:45.920
 and what it might represent? Right. Okay. So the question is, what is, in a sense,

1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:53.680
 the most structural structure you can imagine, right? So, and in fact, what I've recently

1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:58.400
 realized in the last year or so, I have a new most structural structure.

1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:03.840
 By the way, the question itself is a beautiful one and a powerful one in itself. So even without

1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:08.320
 an answer, just the question is a really strong question. Right. Right. But what's your new idea?

1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:15.680
 Well, it has to do with hypergraphs. Essentially, what, what is interesting about the sort of

1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:22.160
 a model I have now is, is a little bit like what happened with computation. Everything that I think

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:28.480
 of as, oh, well, maybe the model is this, I discover it's equivalent. And that's quite

1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:33.680
 encouraging, because it's like, I could say, well, I'm going to look at trivalent graphs with, you

1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:37.600
 know, three edges for each node and so on. Or I could look at this special kind of graph,

1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:43.040
 or I could look at this kind of algebraic structure. And turns out that the things I'm

1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:49.120
 now looking at, everything that I've imagined that is a plausible type of structural structure

1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:54.240
 is equivalent to this. So what is it? Well, a typical way to think about it is,

1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:06.640
 well, so you might have some, some collection of tuples, collection of, of, let's say numbers.

1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:14.800
 So you might have one, three, five, two, three, four, little, just collections of numbers,

1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:19.600
 triples of numbers, let's say quadruples of numbers, pairs of numbers, whatever. And you

1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:26.640
 have all these sort of floating little tuples, they're not in any particular order. And that

1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:32.960
 sort of floating collection of tuples, and I told you this was abstract, represents the whole

1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:40.720
 universe. The only thing that relates them is, when a symbol is the same, it's the same, so

1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:45.440
 to speak. So if you have two tuples, and they contain the same symbol, let's say at the same

1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:50.000
 position of the tuple, the first element of the tuple, then that's represents a relation.

1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:56.720
 Okay, so let me, let me try and peel this back. Wow. Okay. So it's, it's, it's, I told you it's

1:03:56.720 --> 1:04:02.240
 I told you it's abstract, but this is, this is the, this is so the relationship is formed by the same,

1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:07.360
 some aspect of sameness. Right. But, but so think about it in terms of a graph. Yeah. So a graph,

1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:14.400
 bunch of nodes, let's say you number each node. Okay. Then what is a graph? A graph is a set of

1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:21.040
 pairs that say this node has an edge connecting it to this other node. So that's the, that's an

1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:28.400
 a graph is just a collection of those pairs that say this node connects to this other node.

1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:34.000
 So this is a generalization of that in which instead of having pairs, you have arbitrary

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:41.600
 end tuples. That's it. That's the whole story. And now the question is, okay, so that might be,

1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:45.200
 that might represent the state of the universe. How does the universe evolve? What does the

1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:52.080
 universe do? And so the answer is that what I'm looking at is transformation rules on these

1:04:52.080 --> 1:05:00.240
 hypergraphs. In other words, you say this, whenever you see a, a piece of this hypergraph

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:06.080
 that looks like this, turn it into a piece of hypergraph that looks like this. So on a graph,

1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:10.000
 it might be when you see the sub graph, when you see this thing with a bunch of edges hanging out

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:17.440
 in this particular way, then rewrite it as this other graph. Okay. And so that's the whole story.

1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:25.520
 So the question is what, so now you say, I mean, think, as I say, this is quite abstract. And one

1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:30.880
 of the questions is, where do you do those updating? So you've got this giant graph,

1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:35.440
 what triggers the updating, like, what's the, what's the ripple effect of it? Is it,

1:05:35.440 --> 1:05:41.040
 and I suspect everything's discreet even in time. So,

1:05:41.840 --> 1:05:45.920
 okay. So the question is, where do you do the updates? Yes. And the answer is the rule is,

1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:51.120
 you do them wherever they apply. And you do them, you do them, the order in which the updates is

1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:56.400
 done is not defined. That is, that you can do them. So there may be many possible orderings

1:05:56.400 --> 1:06:02.960
 for these updates. Now, the point is, if imagine you're an observer in this universe. So, and you

1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:08.960
 say, did something get updated? Well, you don't, in any sense, know, until you yourself have been

1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:16.480
 updated. Right. So in fact, all that you can be sensitive to is essentially the causal network

1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:25.280
 of how an event over there affects an event that's in you. It doesn't even feel like observation. That's

1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:29.840
 like, that's something else. You're just part of the whole thing. Yes, you're part of it. But even

1:06:29.840 --> 1:06:36.480
 to have, so the end result of that is all you're sensitive to is this causal network of what event

1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:42.080
 affects what other event. I'm not making a big statement about sort of the structure of the

1:06:42.080 --> 1:06:48.240
 observer. I'm simply saying, I'm simply making the argument that what happens, the microscopic

1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:54.480
 order of these rewrites is not something that any observer, any conceivable observer in this

1:06:54.480 --> 1:07:00.640
 universe can be affected by. Because the only thing the observer can be affected by is this

1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:07.600
 causal network of how the events in the observer are affected by other events that happen in the

1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:11.200
 universe. So the only thing you have to look at is the causal network. You don't really have

1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:15.360
 to look at this microscopic rewriting that's happening. So these rewrites are happening

1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:18.560
 wherever they, they happen wherever they feel like.

1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:26.400
 Causal network, is there, you said that there's not really, so the idea would be an undefined,

1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:30.640
 like what gets updated, the sequence of things is undefined. It's a,

1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:36.240
 that's what you mean by the causal network. But then the causal network is,

1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:41.680
 given that an update has happened, that's an event. Then the question is, is that

1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:45.680
 event causally related to, does that event, if that event didn't happen,

1:07:45.680 --> 1:07:52.320
 then some future event couldn't happen yet. And so you build up this network of what affects what.

1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:59.280
 And so what that does, so when you build up that network, that's kind of the observable

1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:04.160
 aspect of the universe in some sense. And so then you can ask questions about,

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:09.680
 how robust is that observable network of what's happening in the universe?

1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:14.880
 Okay, so here's where it starts getting kind of interesting. So for certain kinds of microscopic

1:08:14.880 --> 1:08:21.360
 rewriting rules, the order of rewrites does not matter to the causal network. And so this is,

1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:26.400
 okay, mathematical logic, moment, this is equivalent to the church Rossa property or the

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:30.960
 confluence property of rewrite rules. And it's the same reason that if you're simplifying an

1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:36.000
 algebraic expression, for example, you can say, oh, let me expand those terms out, let me factor

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:40.560
 those pieces, doesn't matter what order you do that in, you'll always get the same answer.

1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:46.400
 And that's, it's the same fundamental phenomenon that causes for certain kinds of microscopic

1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:52.240
 rewrite rules that causes the causal network to be independent of the microscopic order of

1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:57.280
 rewritings. Why is that property important? Because it implies special relativity.

1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:05.040
 I mean, the reason what the reason it's important is that that property, special

1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:11.760
 relativity says, you can look at these sort of, you can look at different reference frames,

1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:16.400
 you can have different, you can be looking at your notion of what space and what's time

1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:19.760
 can be different, depending on whether you're traveling at a certain speed, depending on

1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:23.600
 whether you're doing this, that and the other. But nevertheless, the laws of physics are the

1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:27.840
 same. That's what the principle of special relativity says is laws of physics are the

1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:35.440
 same independent of your reference frame. Well, turns out this sort of change of the microscopic

1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:39.440
 rewriting order is essentially equivalent to a change of reference frame, or that at least

1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:44.160
 there's a sub part of how that works, that's equivalent to change of reference frame. So,

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:49.440
 somewhat surprisingly, and sort of for the first time in forever, it's possible for an

1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:54.720
 underlying microscopic theory to imply special relativity, to be able to derive it. It's not

1:09:54.720 --> 1:10:00.640
 something you put in as a, this is a, it's something where this other property, causal

1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:06.000
 invariance, which is also the property that implies that there's a single thread of time

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:12.400
 in the universe. It might not be the case that that's that is the, that's what would lead to

1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:17.280
 the possibility of an observer thinking that definite stuff happens. Otherwise, you've got

1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:21.920
 all these possible rewriting orders, and who's to say which one occurred. But with this causal

1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:25.360
 invariance property, there's a, there's a notion of a definite thread of time.

1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:30.800
 It sounds like that that kind of idea of time, even space would be emergent from the system.

1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:33.360
 Oh, yeah. No, I mean, it's not a fundamental part of the system.

1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:38.640
 No, no, a fundamental level, all you've got is a bunch of nodes connected by hyper edges or

1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:43.440
 whatever. So there's no time, there's no space. That's right. And but, but the, the thing is that

1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:47.920
 it's just like imagining, imagine you're just dealing with a graph, and imagine you have something

1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:53.680
 like a, you know, like a honeycomb graph where you have a bunch of hexagons, you know, that graph

1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:58.160
 at a microscopic level, it's just a bunch of nodes connected to other nodes. But at a macroscopic

1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:03.840
 level, you say that looks like a honeycomb, you know, this lattice, it looks like a two dimensional,

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:08.400
 you know, manifold of some kind, it looks like a two dimensional thing. If you connect it

1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:12.480
 differently, if you just connect all the nodes one, one to another, and kind of a sort of linked

1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:17.120
 list type structure, then you'd say, well, that looks like a one dimensional space.

1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:22.320
 But at the microscopic level, all these are just networks with nodes, the macroscopic level,

1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:26.000
 they look like something that's like one of our sort of familiar kinds of space.

1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:31.360
 And it's the same thing with these hypergraphs. Now, if you ask me, have I found one that gives

1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:36.480
 me three dimensional space, the answer is not yet. So we don't know, you know, this is one of these

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:41.920
 things, we're kind of betting against nature, so to speak. And I have no way to know. So there

1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:47.200
 are many other properties of this, this kind of system that have are very beautiful, actually, and

1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:52.320
 very suggestive. And it will be very elegant if this turns out to be right, because it's very,

1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:57.200
 it's very clean. I mean, you start with nothing, and everything gets built up, everything about

1:11:57.200 --> 1:12:03.440
 space, everything about time, everything about matter, it's all just emergent from the properties

1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:08.000
 of this extremely low level system. And that, that will be pretty cool if that's the way our

1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:15.840
 universe works. Now, do I, on the other hand, the thing that, that I find very confusing is,

1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:23.200
 let's say we succeed, let's say we can say, this particular sort of hypergraph rewriting rule

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:28.720
 gives the universe, just run that hypergraph rewriting rule for enough times, and you'll get

1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:34.080
 everything, you'll get this conversation we're having, you'll get everything. It's that,

1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:40.800
 if we get to that point, and we look at what is this thing, what is this rule that we just have,

1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:44.880
 that is giving us our whole universe, how do we think about that thing? Let's say,

1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:49.840
 turns out the minimal version of this, and this is kind of cool thing for a language designer like

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:56.000
 me, the minimal version of this model is actually a single line of orphan language code. So that's,

1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:01.840
 which I wasn't sure was going to happen that way. But it's, it's a, that's, it's kind of,

1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:07.760
 it's kind of, no, we don't know what, we don't know what, that's, that's just the framework to

1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:13.120
 know the actual particular hypergraph that might be a longer, the specification of the rules might

1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:19.120
 be slightly longer. How does that help you accept marveling in the beauty and the elegance of the

1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:24.000
 simplicity that creates the universe? That does that help us predict anything? Not really, because

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:28.960
 of the irreducibility. That's correct. That's correct. But so the thing that is really strange

1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:36.240
 to me, and I haven't wrapped my, my brain around this yet, is, you know, one is, one keeps on

1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:41.280
 realizing that we're not special in the sense that, you know, we don't live at the center of the

1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:48.320
 universe, we don't blah, blah, blah. And yet, if we produce a rule for the universe, and it's

1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:54.480
 quite simple, and we can write it down and couple of lines or something, that feels very special.

1:13:54.480 --> 1:14:00.480
 How do we come to get a simple universe when many of the available universes, so to speak,

1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:05.280
 are incredibly complicated? It might be, you know, a quintillion characters long.

1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:09.520
 Why did we get one of the ones that's simple? And so I haven't wrapped my brain around that as

1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:17.040
 you yet. If indeed we are in such a simple, the universe is such a simple rule, is it possible

1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:24.480
 that there is something outside of this that we are in a kind of what people call the simulation,

1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:29.440
 right? That we're just part of a computation that's being explored by a graduate student

1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:34.560
 in an alternate universe. Well, you know, the problem is, we don't get to say much about what's

1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:40.080
 outside our universe, because by definition, our universe is what we exist within. Now,

1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:45.360
 can we make a sort of almost theological conclusion from being able to know how our

1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:51.360
 particular universe works? Interesting question. I don't think that if you ask the question,

1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:57.600
 could we, and it relates again to this question about extraterrestrial intelligence, you know,

1:14:57.600 --> 1:15:03.680
 we've got the rule for the universe. Was it built on purpose? Hard to say. That's the same thing as

1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:10.000
 saying we see a signal from, you know, that we're, you know, receiving from some, you know, random

1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:15.760
 star somewhere, and it's a series of pulses. And, you know, it's a periodic series of pulses,

1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:20.000
 let's say. Was that done on purpose? Can we conclude something about the origin of that

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:27.360
 series of pulses? Just because it's elegant does not necessarily mean that somebody created it,

1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:33.360
 or that we can even comprehend what we created. Yeah, I think it's the ultimate version of the

1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:38.640
 sort of identification of the techno signature question. The ultimate version of that is,

1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:44.320
 was our universe a piece of technology, so to speak? And how on earth would we know? Because,

1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:49.120
 but I mean, it'll be, it's, I mean, you know, in the kind of crazy science fiction thing you

1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:53.440
 could imagine, you could say, oh, somebody's going to have, you know, there's going to be a

1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:58.720
 signature there, it's going to be, you know, made by so and so. But there's no way we could

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:04.240
 understand that, so to speak. And it's not clear what that would mean. Because the universe simply,

1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:11.600
 you know, this, if we find a rule for the universe, we're not, we're simply saying that rule represents

1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:17.760
 what our universe does. We're not saying that that rule is something running on a big computer

1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:22.640
 and making our universe. It's just saying that represents what our universe does in the same

1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:26.960
 sense that, you know, laws of classical mechanics, differential equations, whatever they are,

1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:33.120
 represent what mechanical systems do. It's not that the mechanical systems are somehow

1:16:33.120 --> 1:16:37.840
 running solutions to those differential equations. Those differential equations are just representing

1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:43.680
 the behavior of those systems. So what's the gap in your sense to linger on the fascinating,

1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:49.760
 perhaps slightly sci fi question? What's the gap between understanding the fundamental rules that

1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:55.840
 create a universe and engineering a system, actually creating a simulation ourselves? So

1:16:55.840 --> 1:17:02.240
 you've talked about sort of, you've talked about, you know, nano engineering kind of ideas that

1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:06.640
 are kind of exciting, actually creating some ideas of computation in the physical space.

1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:11.360
 How hard is it as an engineering problem to create the universe once you know the rules

1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:16.080
 that create it? Well, that's an interesting question. I think the substrate on which the

1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:21.040
 universe is operating is not a substrate that we have access to. I mean, the only substrate we have

1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:26.320
 is that same substrate that the universe is operating in. So if the universe is a bunch of

1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:32.320
 hypergraphs being rewritten, then we get to attach ourselves to those same hypergraphs being rewritten.

1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:39.600
 We don't get to, and if you ask the question, you know, is the code clean, you know, is,

1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:45.040
 you know, can we write nice, elegant code with efficient algorithms and so on? Well,

1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:49.360
 that's an interesting question. How, you know, that's this question of how much computational

1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:53.280
 reducibility there is in the system. But so I've seen some beautiful cellular

1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:57.920
 automata that basically create copies of itself within itself, right? So that's the question

1:17:57.920 --> 1:18:03.280
 whether it's possible to create, like, whether you need to understand the substrate or whether you

1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:08.480
 can just... Yeah, well, right. I mean, so one of the things that is sort of one of my slightly

1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:14.480
 sci fi thoughts about the future, so to speak, is, you know, right now, if you poll typical people

1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:19.360
 who say, do you think it's important to find the fundamental theory of physics? You get,

1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:24.000
 because I've done this poll informally, at least. It's curious, actually. You get a

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:27.120
 decent fraction of people saying, oh, yeah, that would be pretty interesting.

1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:34.400
 I think that's becoming surprisingly enough more, I mean, a lot of people are interested

1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:39.600
 in physics in a way that, like, without understanding it, just kind of watching

1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:46.080
 scientists, a very small number of them struggle to understand the nature of our reality.

1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:51.600
 Right. I mean, I think that's somewhat true. And in fact, in this project that I'm launching into

1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:55.920
 to try and find fundamental theory of physics, I'm going to do it as a very public project.

1:18:55.920 --> 1:18:59.680
 I mean, it's going to be live streamed and all this kind of stuff. And I don't know what will

1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:06.960
 happen. It'll be kind of fun. I mean, I think that it's the interface to the world of this project.

1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:13.360
 I mean, I figure one feature of this project is, you know, unlike technology projects that

1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:17.840
 basically are what they are, this is a project that might simply fail because it might be the case

1:19:17.840 --> 1:19:21.920
 that it generates all kinds of elegant mathematics that has absolutely nothing to do with the physical

1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:27.680
 universe that we happen to live in. Well, okay, so we're talking about kind of the quest to find

1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:33.600
 the fundamental theory of physics. First point is, you know, it's turned out it's kind of hard to

1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:38.000
 find the fundamental theory of physics. People weren't sure that that would be the case. Back

1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:44.240
 in the early days of applying mathematics to science, 1600s and so on, people were like, oh,

1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:47.840
 in 100 years, we'll know everything there is to know about how the universe works,

1:19:47.840 --> 1:19:51.680
 turned out to be harder than that. And people got kind of humble at some level,

1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:56.000
 because every time we got to sort of a greater level of smallness in studying the universe,

1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:02.000
 it seemed like the math got more complicated and everything got got harder. The, you know,

1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:08.080
 when I, when I was a kid, basically, I started doing particle physics. And, you know, when I was

1:20:08.080 --> 1:20:14.000
 doing particle physics, I always thought finding the fundamental, fundamental theory of physics,

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:19.440
 that's a kooky business, we'll never be able to do that. But we can operate within these frameworks

1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:23.360
 that we built for doing quantum field theory and general relativity and things like this.

1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:27.920
 And it's all good. And we can figure out a lot of stuff. Did you even at that time have a sense

1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:34.400
 that there's something behind that too? Sure. I just didn't expect that. I thought in some rather

1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:40.960
 un, it's actually kind of crazy and thinking back on it, because it's kind of like there was this

1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:44.240
 long period in civilization where people thought the ancients had it all figured out and we'll

1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:49.360
 never figure out anything new. And to some extent, that's the way I felt about physics,

1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:54.240
 when I was in the middle of doing it, so to speak, was, you know, we've got quantum field

1:20:54.240 --> 1:20:58.640
 theory, it's the foundation of what we're doing. And there's, you know, yes, there's probably

1:20:58.640 --> 1:21:04.240
 something underneath this, but we'll sort of never figure it out. But then I started studying

1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:10.080
 simple programs in the computational universe, things like cellular automata and so on. And I

1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:15.200
 discovered that there's they do all kinds of things that were completely at odds with the

1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:21.120
 intuition that I had had. And so after that, after you see this tiny little program that does all

1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:26.320
 this amazingly complicated stuff, then you start feeling a bit more ambitious about physics and

1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:32.640
 saying maybe we could do this for physics too. And so that's, that got me started years ago now,

1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:39.520
 and this kind of idea of could we actually find what's underneath all of these frameworks like

1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:43.360
 quantum field theory and general relativity and so on. And people perhaps don't realize as clearly

1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:47.600
 as they might that, you know, the frameworks we're using for physics, which is basically these two

1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:54.080
 things quantum field theory, sort of the theory of small stuff and general relativity theory of

1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:59.120
 gravitation and large stuff, those are the two basic theories. And they're 100 years old. I mean,

1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:06.640
 general relativity was 1915, quantum field theory, well 1920s. So basically 100 years old. And they've,

1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:13.200
 they've, it's been a good run. There's a lot of stuff been figured out. But what's interesting is

1:22:13.200 --> 1:22:18.000
 the foundations haven't changed in all that period of time, even though the foundations had changed

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:24.560
 several times before that in the 200 years earlier than that. And I think the kinds of things that

1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:28.240
 I'm thinking about, which is sort of really informed by thinking about computation and the

1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:32.800
 computational universe, it's a different foundation, it's a different set of foundations,

1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:40.080
 and might be wrong. But it is at least, you know, we have a shot. And I think it's, you know, to me,

1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:48.320
 it's, you know, my personal calculation for myself is, is, you know, if it turns out that the

1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:51.840
 finding the fundamental theory of physics, it's kind of low hanging fruit, so to speak,

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:57.520
 it'd be a shame if we just didn't think to do it. You know, people just said, oh, you'll never

1:22:57.520 --> 1:23:02.880
 figure that stuff out. Let's, you know, and it takes another 200 years before anybody gets around

1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:09.920
 to doing it. You know, I think it's, I don't know how low hanging this fruit actually is. It may be

1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:15.440
 you know, it may be that it's kind of the wrong century to do this project. I mean, I think the,

1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:20.880
 the, the cautionary tale for me, you know, I think about things that I've tried to do in technology

1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:26.560
 where people thought about doing them a lot earlier. I mean, my, my favorite example is

1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:32.080
 probably Leibniz who, who thought about making essentially encapsulating the world's knowledge

1:23:32.080 --> 1:23:39.520
 in a computational form in the late 1600s, and did a lot of things towards that. And basically,

1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:44.240
 you know, we finally managed to do this, but he was 300 years too early. And that's the,

1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:48.080
 that's kind of the, in terms of life planning, it's kind of like,

1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:51.920
 avoid things that can't be done in your, in your century, so to speak.

1:23:51.920 --> 1:24:00.720
 Yeah, timing, timing is everything. So you think if we kind of figure out the underlying rules it

1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:06.400
 can create from which quantum field theory and space general relativity can emerge,

1:24:06.400 --> 1:24:09.120
 do you think they'll help us unify it at that level of abstraction?

1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:13.120
 Oh, we'll know it completely. We'll know how that all fits together. Yes, without a question.

1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:21.040
 And I mean, it's already, even the things I've already done, there are very, you know, it's,

1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:25.440
 it's very, very elegant, actually, how, how things seem to be fitting together. Now, you know,

1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:31.760
 is it right? I don't know yet. It's awfully suggestive. If it isn't right, it's then

1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:35.600
 the designer of the universe should feel embarrassed, so to speak, because it's a really

1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:40.720
 good way to do it. And your intuition in terms of designing the universe, does God play dice?

1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:46.880
 Is there, is there randomness in this thing? Or is it deterministic? So the kind of...

1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:51.040
 That's a little bit of a complicated question, because when you're dealing with these things

1:24:51.040 --> 1:24:56.160
 that involve these rewrites that have, okay, even randomness is an emergent phenomenon, perhaps.

1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:02.240
 Yes, yes. I mean, it's, yeah, well, randomness, in many of these systems, pseudo randomness and

1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:07.760
 randomness are hard to distinguish. In this particular case, the current idea that we have

1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:14.880
 about measurement and quantum mechanics is something very bizarre and very abstract.

1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:21.280
 And I don't think I can yet explain it without kind of yacking about very technical things.

1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:27.600
 Eventually, I will be able to. But if that's, if that's right, it's kind of a, it's a weird thing,

1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:33.520
 because it slices between determinism and randomness in a weird way that hasn't been

1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:38.080
 sliced before, so to speak. So like many of these questions that come up in science,

1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:42.720
 where it's like, is it this or is it that? Turns out the real answer is it's neither of those

1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:48.800
 things, it's something kind of different and sort of orthogonal to those, those, those categories.

1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:53.200
 And so that's the current, you know, this week's idea about how that might work.

1:25:53.200 --> 1:26:00.800
 But, you know, we'll, we'll see how that unfolds. I mean, there's, there's this question about a

1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:06.400
 field like physics and sort of the quest for a fundamental theory and so on. And there's both

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:11.360
 the science of what happens and there's the, the sort of the social aspect of what happens,

1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:18.000
 because, you know, in a field that is basically as old as physics, we're at, I don't know what it is,

1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:22.480
 fourth generation, I don't know, fifth generation, I don't know what generation it is of physicists.

1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:27.840
 And like, I was one of these, so to speak. And for me, the foundations were like the pyramids,

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:34.560
 so to speak, you know, it was that way and it was always that way. It is difficult in an old field

1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:39.760
 to go back to the foundations and think about rewriting them. It's a lot easier in young fields

1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:43.680
 where you're still dealing with the first generation of people who invented the field.

1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:49.600
 And it tends to be the case, you know, that the nature of what happens in science tends to be,

1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:55.600
 you know, you'll get, typically the pattern is some methodological advance occurs. And then

1:26:55.600 --> 1:27:00.240
 there's a period of five years, 10 years, maybe a little bit longer than that, where there's lots

1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:04.640
 of things that are now made possible by that, by that methodological advance, whether it's, you

1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:10.560
 know, I don't know, telescopes or whether that's some mathematical method or something. It's, you

1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:17.680
 know, there's a something, something happens, a tool gets built, and then you can do a bunch of

1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:23.040
 stuff. And there's a bunch of low hanging fruit to be picked. And that takes a certain amount of

1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:29.760
 time. After that, all that low hanging fruit is picked, then it's a hard slog for the next however

1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:36.480
 many decades, or century or more, to get to the next sort of level at which one can do something.

1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:41.600
 And it's kind of a, and it tends to be the case that in fields that are in that kind of, I wouldn't

1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:48.080
 say cruise mode, because it's really hard work, but it's very hard work for very incremental progress.

1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:52.240
 And in your career, and some of the things you've taken on, it feels like you're not,

1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:56.320
 you haven't been afraid of the hard slog. Yeah, that's true.

1:27:56.320 --> 1:28:01.360
 So it's quite interesting, especially on the engineering, on the engineering side.

1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:08.400
 And a small tangent, when you were at Caltech, did you get to interact with Richard Feynman

1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:12.640
 at all? Do you have any memories of Richard? We worked together quite a bit, actually.

1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:17.680
 In fact, on, and in fact, both when I was at Caltech and after I left Caltech,

1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:22.080
 we were both consultants at this company called Thinking Machines Corporation,

1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:26.880
 which was just down the street from here, actually, as ultimately ill fated company. But

1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:31.920
 I used to say this company is not going to work with the strategy they have. And Dick Feynman

1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:36.000
 always used to say, what do we know about running companies? Just let them run their company.

1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:42.640
 But anyway, he was not into that kind of thing. And he always thought,

1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:47.040
 he always thought that my interest in doing things like running companies was a distraction,

1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:55.680
 so to speak. And for me, it's a mechanism to have a more effective machine for actually

1:28:56.560 --> 1:28:59.440
 getting things, figuring things out and getting things to happen.

1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:03.440
 Did he think of it, because essentially what you used, you did with the company,

1:29:03.440 --> 1:29:08.800
 I don't know if you were thinking of it that way, but you're creating tools to empower your,

1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:14.240
 to empower the exploration of the university. Do you think he,

1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:20.480
 did he understand that point? The point of tools of, I think not as well as he might have done.

1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:26.640
 I mean, I think that, but, you know, he was actually my first company, which was also

1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:33.200
 involved with, well, was involved with more mathematical computation kinds of things. You know,

1:29:33.200 --> 1:29:38.080
 he was quite, he had lots of advice about the technical side of what we should do and so on.

1:29:39.200 --> 1:29:41.280
 Do you have examples of memories or thoughts that?

1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:46.800
 Oh, yeah, yeah, he had all kinds of, look, in the business of doing sort of, you know,

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:51.520
 one of the hard things in math is doing integrals and so on, right? And so he had his own elaborate

1:29:51.520 --> 1:29:56.080
 ways to do integrals and so on. He had his own ways of thinking about sort of getting intuition

1:29:56.080 --> 1:30:03.520
 about how math works. And so his sort of meta idea was take those intuitional methods and

1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:09.280
 make a computer follow those intuitional methods. Now, it turns out, for the most part, like when

1:30:09.280 --> 1:30:14.800
 we do integrals and things, what we do is, is we build this kind of bizarre industrial machine

1:30:14.800 --> 1:30:20.320
 that turns every integral into, you know, products of mere g functions and generates this very

1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:24.400
 elaborate thing. And actually, the big problem is turning the results into something a human

1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:29.360
 will understand. It's not quotes doing the integral. And actually, Feynman did understand

1:30:29.360 --> 1:30:34.880
 that to some extent. And I'm embarrassed to say he once gave me this big pile of, you know,

1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:38.640
 calculational methods for particle physics that he worked out in the 50s. And he said,

1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:43.040
 you know, it's more used to you than to me type thing. And I was like, I've intended to look at

1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:49.680
 and give it back. And I still have my files now. So it's, but that's what happens when it's finiteness

1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:54.240
 of human lives. It's, um, I, you know, maybe if he'd live another 20 years, I would have, I would

1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:59.680
 have remembered to give it back. But I think, um, uh, it's, you know, that, that was his attempt to

1:30:59.680 --> 1:31:05.840
 systematize, um, the ways that one does integrals that show up in particle physics and so on.

1:31:05.840 --> 1:31:09.600
 Turns out the way we've actually done it is very different from that way.

1:31:09.600 --> 1:31:14.720
 What do you make of that difference to chain? So Feynman was actually quite remarkable at

1:31:14.720 --> 1:31:20.400
 creating sort of intuitive, like diving in, you know, creating intuitive frameworks for

1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:27.040
 understanding difficult concepts is, I'm smiling because, you know, the funny thing about him was

1:31:27.040 --> 1:31:32.400
 that the thing he was really, really, really good at is calculating stuff. And, but he thought that

1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:38.240
 was easy because he was really good at it. And so he would do these things where he would calculate

1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:43.760
 some, uh, do some complicated calculation in quantum field theory, for example, come out with

1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:47.440
 the results. Wouldn't tell anybody about the complicated calculation because he thought that

1:31:47.440 --> 1:31:52.320
 was easy. He thought the really impressive thing was to have this simple intuition about how

1:31:52.320 --> 1:31:58.000
 everything works. So he invented that at the end. And, you know, because he'd done this calculation

1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:02.640
 and knew what, how it worked, it was a lot easier. It's a lot easier to have good intuition when

1:32:02.640 --> 1:32:06.960
 you know what the answer is. And, and then, and then he would just not tell anybody about these

1:32:06.960 --> 1:32:11.920
 calculations. And he wasn't meaning that maliciously, so to speak. It's just, he thought that was easy.

1:32:11.920 --> 1:32:17.120
 Yeah. And, and that's, you know, that led to areas where people were just completely mystified

1:32:17.120 --> 1:32:22.000
 and they kind of followed his intuition, but nobody could tell why it worked. Because actually,

1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:25.920
 the reason it worked was because he'd done all these calculations and he knew that it would work.

1:32:25.920 --> 1:32:31.920
 And, you know, when I, he and I worked a bit on quantum computers actually back in 1980, 81,

1:32:32.800 --> 1:32:38.800
 before anybody had heard of those things. And, you know, the typical mode of, I mean,

1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:42.960
 he always used to say, and I now think about this because I'm about the age that he was when I

1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:47.520
 worked with him. And, you know, I see the people who are one third my age, so to speak.

1:32:47.520 --> 1:32:50.880
 And he was always complaining that I was one third his age and therefore

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:57.760
 various things. But, but, you know, he would do some calculation by, by hand, you know,

1:32:57.760 --> 1:33:02.080
 blackboard and things come up with some answer. I'd say, I don't understand this.

1:33:02.800 --> 1:33:08.000
 You know, I do something with a computer. And he'd say, you know, I don't understand this.

1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:13.120
 So, it'd be some big argument about what was, you know, what was going on. But, but it was always

1:33:14.400 --> 1:33:21.440
 and I think actually, many of the things that we sort of realized about quantum computing

1:33:21.440 --> 1:33:24.400
 that were sort of issues that have to do, particularly with the measurement process

1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:30.240
 are kind of still issues today. And I kind of find it interesting. It's a funny thing in science

1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:35.120
 that these, you know, that there's, there's a remarkable, it happens in technology too,

1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:39.360
 there's a remarkable sort of repetition of history that ends up occurring.

1:33:40.080 --> 1:33:45.120
 Eventually, things really get nailed down. But it often takes a while and it often things come

1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:50.880
 back decades later. Well, for example, I could tell a story actually happened right down the

1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:56.880
 street from here. When we were both thinking machines, I had been working on this particular

1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:03.200
 cellular automaton called Rule 30 that has this feature that it from very simple initial conditions,

1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:10.000
 it makes really complicated behavior. Okay. So, and actually, of all silly physical things,

1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:16.880
 using this big parallel computer called a connection machine that that company was making,

1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:21.680
 I generated this giant printout of Rule 30 on very, on actually on the same kind of,

1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:30.080
 same kind of printer that people use to make layouts for microprocessors. So, one of these big,

1:34:30.080 --> 1:34:36.000
 you know, large format printers with high resolution and so on. So, okay, so print this out,

1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:44.080
 lots of very tiny cells. And so there was sort of a question of how some features of that pattern.

1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:48.960
 And so it was very much a physical, you know, on the floor with meter rules trying to measure

1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:54.560
 different things. So, so Feynman kind of takes me aside, we've been doing that for a little while

1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:59.040
 and takes me aside. And he says, I just want to know this one thing. He says, I want to know,

1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:04.160
 how did you know that this Rule 30 thing would produce all this really complicated behavior

1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:08.480
 that is so complicated that we're, you know, going around with this big printout and so on?

1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:14.400
 And I said, Well, I didn't know, I just enumerated all the possible rules and then

1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:19.520
 observed that that's what happened. He said, Oh, I feel a lot better. You know, I thought you had

1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:24.960
 some intuition that he didn't have that would let when I said no, no, no, no, no intuition,

1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:30.400
 just experimental science. So that's such a beautiful sort of dichotomy there.

1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:36.080
 Of that's exactly what you showed is you really can't have an intuition about and reduce it.

1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:40.400
 I mean, you have to run it. Yes, that's right. That's so hard for us humans and especially

1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:50.400
 brilliant physicists like Feynman to say that you can't have a compressed, clean intuition about

1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:56.880
 how the whole thing works. No, he was, I mean, I think he was sort of on the edge of understanding

1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:01.680
 that point about computation. And I think he found that, I think he always found computation

1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:08.080
 interesting. And I think that was sort of what he was a little bit poking at. I mean, that intuition,

1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:11.840
 you know, the difficulty of discovering things like even you say, Oh, you know,

1:36:11.840 --> 1:36:15.440
 you just enumerate all the cases and just find one that does something interesting, right?

1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:20.880
 Sounds very easy. Turns out, like, I missed it when I first saw it because I had kind of an

1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:25.440
 intuition that said it shouldn't be there. And so I had kind of arguments, Oh, I'm going to ignore

1:36:25.440 --> 1:36:32.000
 that case because whatever. And how did you have an open mind enough? Because you're essentially

1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:37.120
 the same person as we should find like the same kind of physics type of thinking. How did you

1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:44.080
 find yourself having a sufficiently open mind to be open to watching rules and them revealing

1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:47.440
 complexity? Yeah, I think that's interesting question. I've wondered about that myself,

1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:51.440
 because it's kind of like, you know, you live through these things. And then you say,

1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:55.920
 what was the historical story? And sometimes the historical story that you realize after the fact

1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:01.600
 was not what you lived through, so to speak. And so, you know, what I realized is I think

1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:09.200
 what happened is, you know, I did physics, kind of like reductionistic physics, where you're

1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:14.240
 thrown the universe and you're told go figure out what's going on inside it. And then I started

1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:19.840
 building computer tools. And I started building my first computer language, for example. And

1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:23.920
 computer language is not like it's sort of like physics in the sense that you have to take all

1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:28.640
 those computations people want to do, and kind of drill down and find the primitives that they

1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:32.800
 can all be made of. But then you do something is really different, because you're just, you're

1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:37.760
 just saying, Okay, these are the primitives. Now, you know, hopefully, they'll be useful to people,

1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:43.280
 let's build up from there. So you're essentially building an artificial universe in a sense,

1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:47.280
 where you make this language, you've got these primitives, you're just building whatever you

1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:53.040
 feel like building. And that's, and so it was sort of interesting for me, because from doing science,

1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:58.720
 where you just thrown the universe as the universe is, to then just being told, you know,

1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:04.560
 you can make up any universe you want. And so I think that experience of making a computer language,

1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:10.000
 which is essentially building your own universe, so to speak, is, you know, that's kind of the,

1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:15.600
 that's, that's what gave me a somewhat different attitude towards what might be possible. It's

1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:21.520
 like, let's just explore what can be done in these artificial universes, rather than thinking the

1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:26.000
 natural science way of let's be constrained by how the universe actually is. Yeah, by being able

1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:31.760
 to program, essentially, you've, as opposed to being limited to just your mind and a pen,

1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:37.840
 you now have, you've basically built another brain that you can use to explore the universe by

1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:43.600
 computer program, you know, this is kind of a brain. Right. And it's, well, it's, or a telescope,

1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:47.520
 or, you know, it's a tool, it's, it lets you see stuff. But there's something fundamentally

1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:54.000
 different between a computer and a telescope. I mean, it just, I'm hoping not to romanticize

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:59.840
 the notion, but it's more general, the computer is more general. And it's, I think, I mean,

1:38:59.840 --> 1:39:07.200
 this point about, you know, people say, Oh, such and such a thing was almost discovered at such and

1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:12.400
 such a time, the, the distance between, you know, the building, the paradigm that allows you to

1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:18.080
 actually understand stuff or allows one to be open to seeing what's going on. That's really hard.

1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:24.080
 And, you know, I think in, I've been fortunate in my life that I spent a lot of my time building

1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:32.800
 computational language. And that's an activity that in a sense works by sort of having to

1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:39.040
 kind of create another level of abstraction and kind of be open to different kinds of structures.

1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:45.760
 But, you know, it's, it's always, I mean, I'm fully aware of, I suppose, the fact that I have seen it

1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:51.760
 a bunch of times of how easy it is to miss the obvious, so to speak, that at least is factored

1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:59.360
 into my attempt to not miss the obvious, although it may not succeed. What do you think is the role

1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:08.720
 of ego in the history of math and science? And more sort of, you know, a book titled something

1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:16.320
 like a new kind of science, you've accomplished a huge amount. In fact, somebody said that Newton

1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:21.840
 didn't have an ego and I looked into it and he had a huge ego. But from an outsider's perspective,

1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:29.600
 some have said that you have a bit of an ego as well. Do you see it that way? Does ego get in

1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:35.680
 the way? Is it empowering? Is it both? It's complicated and necessary. I mean, you know,

1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:42.000
 I've had, look, I've spent more than half my life CEO in a tech company. Right. Okay. And, you know,

1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:51.200
 that is a, I think it's actually very, it means that one's ego is not a distant thing.

1:40:51.200 --> 1:40:56.320
 It's a thing that one encounters every day, so to speak, because it's all tied up with leadership

1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:01.120
 and with how one develops an organization and all these kinds of things. So, you know,

1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:05.120
 it may be that if I'd been an academic, for example, I could have sort of, you know,

1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:10.160
 checked the ego, put it on, put it on a shelf somewhere and ignored its characteristics. But

1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:15.120
 you're reminded of it quite often in the context of running a company.

1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:19.120
 Sure. I mean, that's what it's about. It's about leadership and, you know,

1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:24.880
 leadership is intimately tied to ego. Now, what does it mean? I mean, what is the,

1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:30.560
 you know, for me, I've been fortunate that I think I have reasonable intellectual confidence,

1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:37.040
 so to speak. That is, you know, I'm one of these people who at this point, if somebody tells me

1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:43.600
 something and I just don't understand it, my conclusion isn't that means I'm dumb, that my

1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:48.720
 conclusion is there's something wrong with what I'm being told. And that was actually Dick Feynman

1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:54.000
 used to have that feature too. He never really believed it. He actually believed in experts

1:41:54.000 --> 1:42:01.680
 much less than I believe in experts. Wow. So, that's a fundamentally powerful

1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:11.040
 property of ego and saying like, not that I am wrong, but that the world is wrong and tell me,

1:42:11.040 --> 1:42:15.760
 like when confronted with the fact that doesn't fit the thing that you've really thought through,

1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:23.360
 sort of both the negative and the positive of ego, do you see the negative of that get in the way,

1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:27.680
 sort of being confronted with... Sure, there are mistakes I've made that are the result of

1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:34.720
 I'm pretty sure I'm right and turns out I'm not. I mean, that's the... But the thing is that

1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:42.960
 the idea that one tries to do things that... So, for example, one question is if people have tried

1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:49.440
 hard to do something and then one thinks maybe I should try doing this myself, if one does not

1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:52.720
 have a certain degree of intellectual confidence when it just says, well, people have been trying

1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:58.480
 to do this for 100 years, how am I going to be able to do this? And I was fortunate in the sense

1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:03.200
 that I happened to start having some degree of success in science and things when I was really

1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:07.760
 young. And so, that developed a certain amount of sort of intellectual confidence that I don't

1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:14.000
 think I otherwise would have had. And in a sense, I mean, I was fortunate that I was working in a

1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:20.080
 field, particle physics, during its sort of golden age of rapid progress. And that kind of gives

1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:25.600
 one a false sense of achievement because it's kind of easy to discover stuff that's going to survive

1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:29.680
 if you happen to be picking the low hanging fruit of a rapidly expanding field.

1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:35.920
 And the reason I totally, I totally immediately understood the ego behind a new kind of science

1:43:35.920 --> 1:43:41.120
 to me. Let me sort of just try to express my feelings on the whole thing is that if you don't

1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:47.760
 allow that kind of ego, then you would never write that book that you would say, well,

1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:53.440
 people must have done this. You would not dig. You would not keep digging. And I think that was,

1:43:54.240 --> 1:44:01.040
 I think, you have to take that ego and ride it and see where it takes you. And that's how you

1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:07.360
 create exceptional work. But I think the other point about that book was, it was a non trivial

1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:12.960
 question, how to take a bunch of ideas that are, I think, reasonably big ideas. They might,

1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:17.920
 you know, their importance is determined by what happens historically. One can't tell how important

1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:23.600
 they are. One can tell sort of the scope of them. And the scope is fairly big. And they're very

1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:27.840
 different from things that have come before. And the question is, how do you explain that stuff to

1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:33.360
 people? And so I had had the experience of sort of saying, well, that these things, there's a

1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:37.840
 cellular automaton, it does this, it does that. And people are like, Oh, it must be just like this,

1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:42.160
 it must be just like that. So no, it isn't, it's something different. Right.

1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:46.000
 And so I could have done sort of, I'm really glad you did what you did, but you could have done

1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:51.040
 sort of academically, just publish, keep publishing small papers here and there. And then you would

1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:55.440
 just keep getting this kind of resistance, right? You would get like, yeah, it's supposed to just

1:44:55.440 --> 1:45:01.360
 dropping a thing that says here, here's the full, the full thing. No, I mean, that was my calculation

1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:07.520
 is that basically, you know, you could introduce little pieces, it's like, you know, one possibility

1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:12.800
 is like, it's the secret weapon, so to speak, it's this, you know, I keep on, you know, discovering

1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:17.360
 these things in all these different areas, where'd they come from? Nobody knows. But I decided that,

1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:22.160
 you know, in the interests of one only has one life to lead him, you know, writing that book

1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:26.720
 took me a decade. Anyway, it's not, there's not a lot of wiggle room, so to speak, one can't

1:45:26.720 --> 1:45:31.600
 be wrong by a factor of three, so to speak, and how long it's going to take. That I, you know,

1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:40.000
 I thought the best thing to do, the thing that is most sort of, that most respect the, the

1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:45.920
 intellectual content, so to speak, is you just put it out with as much force as you can, because

1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:50.720
 it's not something where, and, you know, it's an interesting thing, you talk about ego, and it's,

1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:56.480
 it's, you know, for example, I run a company, which has my name on it, right? I thought about

1:45:56.480 --> 1:46:00.800
 starting a club for people whose companies have their names on them. And it's a funny group,

1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:06.240
 because we're not a bunch of egomaniacs. That's not what it's about, so to speak. It's about

1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:12.080
 basically sort of taking responsibility for what one's doing. And, you know, in a sense,

1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:19.680
 any of these things where you're sort of putting yourself on the line, it's, it's kind of a funny,

1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:26.720
 it's a funny dynamic, because in a sense, my company is sort of something that happens to

1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:31.440
 have my name on it. But it's kind of bigger than me, and I'm kind of just its mascot at some level.

1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:36.320
 I mean, I also happen to be a pretty, you know, strong leader of it. But,

1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:45.920
 but it's basically showing a deep, inextricable sort of investment. The same, your name,

1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:55.760
 like Steve Jobs's name wasn't on, on Apple, but he was Apple. Elon Musk's name is not on Tesla,

1:46:55.760 --> 1:47:01.840
 but he is Tesla. So it's like, it meaning emotionally. It's, if company's successor fails,

1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:07.600
 he would just, that emotionally would suffer through that. And so that's, that's, that's a

1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:11.440
 beautiful. Yeah, it's recognizing that fact tonight. And also Wolfram is a pretty good branding name,

1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:16.400
 so it works out. Yeah, right, exactly. Just, I think Steve had it had a bad deal there.

1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:24.160
 Yeah. So you, you made up for it with the last name. Okay, so, so in 2002, you published a new

1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:30.800
 kind of science to which sort of on a personal level, I can credit my love for cellular automata

1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:36.960
 and computation in general. I think a lot of others can as well. Can you briefly describe

1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:45.760
 the vision, the hope, the main idea presented in this 1200 page book?

1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:53.920
 Sure. Although it took 1200 pages to say in the book. So no, the real idea, it's kind of

1:47:54.800 --> 1:47:58.480
 a good way to get into it is to look at sort of the arc of history and to look at what's

1:47:58.480 --> 1:48:03.840
 happened in kind of the development of science. I mean, there was this sort of big idea in science

1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:10.960
 about 300 years ago that was, let's use mathematical equations to try and describe things in the world.

1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:16.000
 Let's use sort of the formal idea of mathematical equations to describe what might be happening

1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:20.720
 in the world, rather than, for example, just using sort of logical augmentation and so on.

1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:26.320
 Let's have a formal theory about that. And so there've been this 300 year run of using

1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:30.560
 mathematical equations to describe the natural world, which have worked pretty well. But I got

1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:35.760
 interested in how one could generalize that notion, you know, there is a formal theory,

1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:41.680
 there are definite rules, but what structure could those rules have? And so what I got interested in

1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:47.280
 was, let's generalize beyond the sort of purely mathematical rules. And we now have this sort

1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:53.840
 of notion of programming and computing and so on. Let's use the kinds of rules that can be embodied

1:48:53.840 --> 1:49:00.000
 in programs to as a sort of generalization of the ones that can exist in mathematics as a way

1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:07.440
 to describe the world. And so my kind of favorite version of these kinds of simple rules are these

1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:13.840
 things called cellular automata. And so typical case, shall we, what are cellular automata?

1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:20.080
 Fair enough. So typical case of a cellular automaton, it's an array of cells. It's just a

1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:27.600
 line of discrete cells. Each cell is either black or white. And in a series of steps that you can

1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:33.600
 represent as lines going down a page, you're updating the color of each cell according to a rule that

1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:38.480
 depends on the color of the cell above it and to its left and right. So it's really simple. So

1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:50.320
 a thing might be, you know, if the cell and its right neighbor are not the same, and or the cell

1:49:50.320 --> 1:49:57.760
 on the left is black or something, then make it black on the next step. And if not, make it white.

1:49:57.760 --> 1:50:03.520
 Typical rule. That rule, I'm not sure I said it exactly right, but a rule very much like what I

1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:08.720
 just said, has the feature that if you started off from just one black cell at the top, it makes

1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:15.120
 this extremely complicated pattern. So some rules, you get a very simple pattern. Some rules,

1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:20.960
 you have the rule is simple, you start them off from a sort of simple seed, you just get this very

1:50:20.960 --> 1:50:26.800
 simple pattern. But other rules, and this was the big surprise when I started actually just doing

1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:32.320
 the simple computer experiments to find out what happens is that they produce very complicated

1:50:32.320 --> 1:50:38.480
 patterns of behavior. So for example, this rule 30 rule has the feature you started from just one

1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:45.280
 black cell at the top, makes this very random pattern. If you look like at the center column of

1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:50.800
 cells, you get a series of values, you know, it goes black, white, black, black, whatever it is,

1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:58.640
 that sequence seems for all practical purposes random. So it's kind of like in math, you know,

1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:06.640
 you compute the digits of pi 3.1415926, whatever, those digits, once computed, I mean, the scheme

1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:10.480
 for computing pi, you know, it's the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle,

1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:16.480
 very well defined. But yet, when you are, once you've generated those digits, they seem for all

1:51:16.480 --> 1:51:22.640
 practical purposes completely random. And so it is with rule 30, that even though the rule is very

1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:29.200
 simple, much simpler, much more sort of computationally obvious than the rule for generating digits of pi,

1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:34.000
 even with a rule that simple, you're still generating immensely complicated behavior.

1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:38.720
 Yeah. So if we could just pause on that, I think you probably have said it and looked at it so

1:51:38.720 --> 1:51:44.080
 long, you forgot the magic of it, or perhaps you don't, you still feel the magic. But to me,

1:51:44.080 --> 1:51:50.480
 if you've never seen sort of, I would say, what is it, a one dimensional, essentially,

1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:56.880
 cellular automata, right? And you were to guess what you would see if you have

1:51:56.880 --> 1:52:05.680
 some sort of cells that only respond to its neighbors. Right. If you were to guess what kind

1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:11.920
 of things you would see, like my initial guess, like, even when I first like, open your book,

1:52:11.920 --> 1:52:18.080
 a new kind of science, right? My initial guess is you would see, I mean, it would be very simple

1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:24.560
 stuff. Right. And I think it's a magical experience to realize the kind of complexity,

1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:29.920
 you mentioned rule 30, still your favorite cellular automaton. So my favorite rule, yes.

1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:37.840
 You get complexity, immense complexity, you get arbitrary complexity. Yes. And when you say

1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:45.360
 randomness down the middle column, you know, that's just one cool way to say that there's

1:52:45.360 --> 1:52:51.680
 incredible complexity. And that's just, I mean, that's a magical idea. However, you start to

1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:57.440
 interpret it, all the reducibility discussions, all that. But it's just, I think that has profound

1:52:57.440 --> 1:53:04.400
 philosophical kind of notions around it too. It's not just, I mean, it's transformational

1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:09.200
 about how you see the world. I think for me, it was transformational. I don't know, we can have

1:53:09.200 --> 1:53:15.200
 all kinds of discussions about computation and so on. But just, you know, I sometimes think,

1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:22.560
 if I were on a desert island, and with, I don't know, maybe with some psychedelics or something,

1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:26.800
 but if I had to take one book, I mean, you kind of science would be it, because you could just

1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:31.920
 enjoy that notion. For some reason, it's a deeply profound notion, at least to me.

1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:38.160
 I find it that way. Yeah. I mean, look, it's been, it was a very intuition breaking

1:53:38.160 --> 1:53:45.520
 thing to discover. I mean, it's kind of like, you point the computational telescope out there,

1:53:45.520 --> 1:53:51.200
 and suddenly you see, I don't know, in the past, it's kind of like Moons of Jupiter or

1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:55.360
 something. But suddenly you see something that's kind of very unexpected. And rule 30 was very

1:53:55.360 --> 1:54:01.440
 unexpected for me. And the big challenge at a personal level was to not ignore it. I mean,

1:54:01.440 --> 1:54:04.800
 people, in other words, you might say, you know,

1:54:04.800 --> 1:54:09.120
 it's a bug. What would you say? Yeah, what would you say? I mean, what are we looking at, by the

1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:13.520
 way? Well, I was just generating here, I'll actually generate a rule 30 pattern. So that's

1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:20.320
 the rule for rule 30. And it says, for example, it says here, if you have a black cell in the

1:54:20.320 --> 1:54:24.080
 middle and black cell to the left and white cell to the right, then the cell on the next step will

1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:29.760
 be white. And so here's the actual pattern that you get starting off from a single black cell

1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:35.440
 at the top there. And then that's the initial state initial condition. That's the initial thing,

1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:40.800
 you just start off from that. And then you're going down the page. And at every at every step,

1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:47.120
 you're just applying this rule to find out the new value that you get. And so you might think,

1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:52.000
 rule that simple, you got to get that there's got to be some trace of that simplicity here.

1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:57.440
 Okay, we'll run it, let's say for 400 steps. It's what it does. It's kind of aliasing a bit

1:54:57.440 --> 1:55:01.680
 on the screen there. But you can see there's a little bit of regularity over on the left.

1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:10.800
 But there's a lot of stuff here that just looks very complicated, very random. And that's a big

1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:15.440
 sort of shock to was a big shock to my intuition, at least, that that's possible.

1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:19.760
 The mind immediately starts, is there a pattern, there must be a repetitive pattern.

1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:25.120
 Yeah, there must be. So I spent so indeed, that's what I thought at first. And I thought,

1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:30.320
 I thought, well, this is kind of interesting. But if we run it long enough, we'll see something

1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:37.120
 will resolve into something simple. And I did all kinds of analysis of using mathematics,

1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:43.440
 statistics, cryptography, whatever, whatever, to try and crack it. And I never succeeded.

1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:47.520
 And after I hadn't succeeded for a while, I started thinking, maybe there's a real

1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:52.240
 phenomenon here, that is the reason I'm not succeeding. Maybe, I mean, the thing that for

1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:57.360
 me was sort of a motivating factor was looking at the natural world and seeing all this complexity

1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:02.240
 that exists in the natural world, the questions, where does it come from? What secret does nature

1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:08.160
 have that lets it make all this complexity that we humans, when we engineer things, typically

1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:13.120
 are not making, we're typically making things that at least look quite simple to us. And so,

1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:18.080
 the shock here was, even from something very simple, you're making something that complex.

1:56:18.080 --> 1:56:24.320
 Maybe this is getting at sort of the secret that nature has that allows it to make really

1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:29.120
 complex things, even though its underlying rules may not be that complex.

1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:36.560
 How did it make you feel? If we look at the Newton, Apple, was there a, you took a walk and

1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:41.600
 something, it profoundly hit you? Or was this a gradual thing,

1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:49.040
 a lapse of being boiled? The truth of every sort of science discovery is, it's not that gradual.

1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:53.120
 I mean, I've spent, I happen to be interested in scientific biography kinds of things. And so,

1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:58.640
 I've tried to track down, how did people come to figure out this or that thing? And there's always

1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:07.840
 a long sort of preparatory, there's a need to be prepared in a mindset in which it's possible

1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:15.040
 to see something. I mean, in the case of Rule 30, I was around June 1st, 1984, was kind of a silly

1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:19.760
 story in some ways. I finally had a high resolution laser printer. So, I was able, so I thought,

1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:24.240
 I'm going to generate a bunch of pictures of these cellular automata. And I generate this one,

1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:29.920
 and I put it, I was on some plane flight to Europe, you have this with me. And it's like,

1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:34.960
 you know, I really should try to understand this. And this is really, you know,

1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:40.240
 this is I really don't understand what's going on. And that was kind of the, you know, slowly

1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:46.640
 trying to, trying to see what was happening. It was not, it was depressingly,

1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:52.880
 unsuddened, so to speak, in the sense that a lot of these ideas, like principle of computational

1:57:52.880 --> 1:57:57.680
 equivalence, for example, you know, I thought, well, that's a possible thing. I didn't know if

1:57:57.680 --> 1:58:02.720
 it's correct. I still don't know for sure that it's correct. But it's sort of a gradual thing

1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:08.240
 that these things gradually kind of become, seem more important than one thought. I mean,

1:58:08.240 --> 1:58:12.720
 I think the whole idea of studying the computational universe of simple programs,

1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:19.120
 it took me probably a decade, decade and a half to kind of internalize that that was

1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:24.880
 really an important idea. And I think, you know, if it turns out we find the whole universe

1:58:24.880 --> 1:58:29.440
 lurking out there in the computational universe, that's a good, you know, it's a good brownie

1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:34.960
 point or something for the, for the whole idea. But I think that the, the thing that's strange

1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:40.320
 in this whole question about, you know, finding this different raw material for making models of

1:58:40.320 --> 1:58:46.160
 things, what's been interesting sort of in the, in sort of arc of history is, you know, for 300

1:58:46.160 --> 1:58:50.720
 years, it's kind of like the, the mathematical equations approach. It was the winner. It was

1:58:50.720 --> 1:58:54.160
 the thing, you know, you want to have a really good model for something that's what you use.

1:58:54.160 --> 1:58:59.280
 The thing that's been remarkable is just in the last decade or so, I think one can see a transition

1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:05.840
 to using not mathematical equations, but programs as sort of the raw material for making models of

1:59:05.840 --> 1:59:12.160
 stuff. And that's pretty neat. And it's kind of, you know, as somebody who's kind of lived inside

1:59:12.160 --> 1:59:18.480
 this paradigm shift, so to speak, it is bizarre. I mean, no doubt in sort of the history of science

1:59:18.480 --> 1:59:24.640
 that will be seen as an instantaneous paradigm shift. But it sure isn't instantaneous when it's

1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:30.960
 played out in one's actual life, so to speak. It seems glacial. And, and it's the kind of thing

1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:37.600
 where, where it's sort of interesting, because in the dynamics of sort of the adoption of ideas

1:59:37.600 --> 1:59:43.600
 like that, into different fields, the younger the field, the faster the adoption typically,

1:59:43.600 --> 1:59:49.360
 because people are not kind of locked in with the fifth generation of people who've studied this field.

1:59:49.920 --> 1:59:54.720
 And it is, it is the way it is, and it can never be any different. And I think that's been,

1:59:55.360 --> 2:00:00.000
 you know, watching that process has been interesting. I mean, I'm, I think I'm fortunate

2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:09.120
 that I, I've, I do stuff mainly because I like doing it. And if I was, that makes me kind of

2:00:09.120 --> 2:00:15.440
 thick skinned about the world's response to what I do. And, but that's definitely, you know,

2:00:15.440 --> 2:00:21.200
 in any time you, you write a book called something like a new kind of science. It's kind of the,

2:00:21.200 --> 2:00:26.000
 the pitchforks will come out for the, for the old kind of science. And I was, it was interesting

2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:35.280
 dynamics. I think that the, I have to say that I was fully aware of the fact that the, when you see

2:00:35.280 --> 2:00:41.920
 sort of incipient paradigm shifts in science, the vigor of the negative response upon early

2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:49.680
 introduction is a fantastic positive indicator of good long term results. So in other words,

2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:56.000
 if people just don't care, it's, you know, that's not such a good sign. If they're like, oh, this

2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:02.320
 is great. That means you didn't really discover anything interesting. What fascinating properties

2:01:02.320 --> 2:01:07.520
 of rule 30 have you discovered over the years? You've recently announced the rule 30 prizes for

2:01:07.520 --> 2:01:13.600
 solving three key problems. Can you maybe talk about interesting properties that have been kind

2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:20.000
 of revealed rule 30 or other cellular automata and what problems are still before us, like the

2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:25.920
 three problems you've announced? Yeah, yeah, right. So I mean, the most interesting thing about

2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:32.480
 cellular automata is that it's hard to figure stuff out about them. And that's, in a sense,

2:01:32.480 --> 2:01:37.920
 every time you try and sort of, you try and bash them with some other technique, you say,

2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:43.920
 can I crack them? The answer is they seem to be uncrackable. They seem to have the feature that

2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:51.280
 they are, that they're sort of showing irreducible computation. They're not, you're not able to say,

2:01:51.280 --> 2:01:56.400
 oh, I know exactly what this is going to do. It's going to do this or that. But there's specific

2:01:56.400 --> 2:02:02.560
 formulations of that fact. Yes, right. So I mean, for example, in rule 30, in the pattern you get,

2:02:02.560 --> 2:02:09.040
 just starting from a single black cell, you get this sort of very, very sort of random looking

2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:14.640
 pattern. And so one feature of that, just look at the center column. And for example, we use that

2:02:14.640 --> 2:02:20.480
 for a long time to generate randomness symbol from language, just what rule 30 produces. Now,

2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:26.160
 the question is, can you prove how random it is? So for example, one very simple question,

2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:31.200
 can you prove that it will never repeat? We haven't been able to show that it will never repeat.

2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:38.320
 We know that if there are two adjacent columns, we know they can't both repeat. But just knowing

2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:44.160
 whether that center column can ever repeat, we still don't even know that. Another problem that

2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:50.960
 I sort of put in my collection of, it's like $30,000 for three, for these three prizes for

2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:58.720
 about rule 30, I would say this is not one of those cases where the money is not the main point.

2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:05.520
 But it's just helps motivate somehow the investigation.

2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:10.240
 So there's three problems you propose, you get $30,000 if you solve all three or maybe,

2:03:10.240 --> 2:03:16.400
 I don't know. No, it's $10,000 for each. That's right, money is not the thing. The problems

2:03:16.400 --> 2:03:22.720
 of themselves are just clean formulations. So it's just, will it ever become periodic?

2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:26.240
 Second problem is, are there an equal number of black and white cells?

2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:29.520
 Down the middle column. Down the middle column. And the third problem is a little bit harder

2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:34.240
 to state, which is essentially, is there a way of figuring out what the color of a cell

2:03:34.240 --> 2:03:41.600
 at position T down the center column is in a, with a less computational effort than about

2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:47.280
 T steps? So in other words, is there a way to jump ahead and say, I know what this is going to do,

2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:54.880
 it's just some mathematical function of T. Or proving that there is no way.

2:03:54.880 --> 2:04:00.160
 Or proving there is no way. Yes. But both, I mean, for any one of these, one could prove

2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:05.920
 that one could discover, we know what rule 30 does for a billion steps. And maybe we'll know

2:04:05.920 --> 2:04:11.120
 for a trillion steps before too very long. But maybe at a quadrillion steps, it suddenly becomes

2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:17.120
 repetitive. You might say, how could that possibly happen? But so when I was writing up these prizes,

2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:21.040
 I thought, and this is typical of what happens in the computational universe, I thought,

2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:25.360
 let me find an example where it looks like it's just going to be random forever,

2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:29.920
 but actually it becomes repetitive. And I found one. And it's just, I did a search,

2:04:29.920 --> 2:04:35.360
 I searched, I don't know, maybe a million different rules with some criterion. And this is,

2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:42.000
 what's sort of interesting about that is, I kind of have this thing that I say in kind of silly way

2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:46.480
 about the computational universe, which is, the animals are always smarter than you are.

2:04:46.480 --> 2:04:49.760
 That is, there's always some way one of these computational systems is going to figure out

2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:54.480
 how to do something, even though I can't imagine how it's going to do it. And I didn't think I

2:04:54.480 --> 2:04:58.800
 would find one that you would think after all these years that when I found sort of all possible

2:04:58.800 --> 2:05:10.480
 things, funky things, that I would have gotten my intuition wrapped around the idea that these

2:05:10.480 --> 2:05:14.240
 creatures are always in the computational universe are always smarter than I'm going to be.

2:05:14.240 --> 2:05:19.760
 But whether they're equivalently smart, right? That's correct. And that makes it,

2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:25.840
 that makes one feel very sort of, it's humbling every time, because every time the thing is,

2:05:25.840 --> 2:05:29.760
 is, you know, you think it's going to do this, or it's not going to be possible to do this.

2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:32.720
 And it turns out it finds a way. Of course, the problem is the thing is,

2:05:32.720 --> 2:05:36.720
 there's a lot of other rules like rule 30. It's just rule 30 is.

2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:42.160
 Oh, it's my favorite because I found it first. And that's right. But the problems are focusing

2:05:42.160 --> 2:05:48.800
 on rule 30. It's possible that rule 30 is repetitive after trillion steps. And that

2:05:48.800 --> 2:05:53.600
 doesn't prove anything about the other rules. It does not. But this is a good sort of experiment

2:05:53.600 --> 2:05:57.120
 of how you go about trying to prove something about a particular rule.

2:05:57.120 --> 2:06:02.320
 Yes. And it also, all these things help build intuition. That is, if it turned out that this

2:06:02.320 --> 2:06:08.480
 was repetitive after a trillion steps, that's not what I would expect. And so we learned something

2:06:08.480 --> 2:06:13.280
 from that. The method to do that, though, would reveal something interesting about the

2:06:13.280 --> 2:06:18.800
 cellular stuff. No doubt. I mean, it's, although it's sometimes challenging, like the, you know,

2:06:18.800 --> 2:06:26.480
 I put out a prize in 2007 for a particular Turing machine that I, there was the simplest

2:06:26.480 --> 2:06:31.760
 candidate for being a universal Turing machine. And the young chap in England named Alex Smith,

2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:37.840
 after a smallish number of months said, I've got a proof. And he did, you know, it took a little

2:06:37.840 --> 2:06:45.840
 while to iterate, but he had a proof. Unfortunately, the proof is very, it's a lot of micro details.

2:06:45.840 --> 2:06:52.000
 It's not, it's not like you look at it and you say, aha, there's a big new principle. The big

2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:57.760
 new principle is the simplest Turing machine that might have been universal actually is universal.

2:06:57.760 --> 2:07:01.840
 And it's incredibly much simpler than the Turing machines that people already knew were universal

2:07:01.840 --> 2:07:07.920
 before that. And so that intuitionally is important because it says computation universality is

2:07:07.920 --> 2:07:13.680
 closer at hand than you might have thought. But the actual methods are not, in that particular

2:07:13.680 --> 2:07:18.000
 case, but not terribly illuminate. It would be nice if the methods would also be elegant.

2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:22.320
 That's true. Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's, it's one of these things where I mean, it's,

2:07:22.320 --> 2:07:27.600
 it's like a lot of, we've talked about earlier, kind of, you know, opening up AIs and machine

2:07:27.600 --> 2:07:32.880
 learning and things of what's going on inside. And is it, is it just step by step? Or can you

2:07:32.880 --> 2:07:37.120
 sort of see the bigger picture more abstractly? It's unfortunate. I mean, with Fermat's last

2:07:37.120 --> 2:07:44.880
 theorem proof, it's unfortunate that the proof to such an elegant theorem is, is not, I mean,

2:07:44.880 --> 2:07:48.880
 it's, it's, it's not, it doesn't flow into the margins of a page.

2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:53.120
 That's true. But you know, one of the things is that's another consequence of computational

2:07:53.120 --> 2:07:59.600
 irreducibility. This, this fact that there are even quite short results in mathematics,

2:07:59.600 --> 2:08:04.080
 whose proofs arbitrarily long. Yes. That's a, that's a consequence of all the stuff. And it's,

2:08:04.080 --> 2:08:10.000
 it's a, it makes one wonder, you know, how come mathematics is possible at all? Right. Why is,

2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:15.920
 you know, why is it the case how people manage to navigate doing mathematics through looking at

2:08:15.920 --> 2:08:22.320
 things where they're not just thrown into, it's all undecidable. That's, that's its own, own separate,

2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:29.120
 separate story. And that would be, that would, that would have a poetic beauty to it as if people

2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:35.680
 were to find something interesting about rule 30, because I mean, there's an emphasis to this

2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:40.560
 particular rule. It wouldn't say anything about the broad irreducibility of all computations,

2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:46.960
 but it would nevertheless put a few smiles on people's faces of. Well, yeah. But to me,

2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:54.080
 it's like, in a sense, establishing principle of computational equivalence, it's a little bit like

2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:59.680
 doing inductive science anywhere. That is, the more examples you find, the more convinced you are

2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:04.240
 that it's generally true. I mean, we don't get to, you know, whenever we do natural science,

2:09:04.880 --> 2:09:10.560
 we, we say, well, it's true here, that this or that happens. Can we, can we prove that it's true

2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:16.240
 everywhere in the universe? No, we can't. So, you know, it's the same thing here, we're exploring

2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:20.800
 the computational universe, we're establishing facts in the computational universe. And that's,

2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:27.440
 that's sort of a way of, of inductively concluding general things.

2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:33.920
 Just to think through this a little bit, we've touched on it a little bit before, but

2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:38.720
 what's the difference between the kind of computation, now that we've talked about cellular

2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:43.360
 automata, what's the difference between the kind of computation, biological systems, our mind,

2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:51.360
 our bodies, the things we see before us that emerged through the process of evolution and cellular

2:09:51.360 --> 2:09:57.200
 automata? I mean, we've kind of implied the discussion of physics underlying everything,

2:09:57.200 --> 2:10:03.440
 but we, we talked about the potential equivalence of the fundamental laws of physics and the kind

2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:09.200
 of computation going on in Turing machines. But can you now connect that, do you think there's

2:10:09.200 --> 2:10:14.800
 something special or interesting about the kind of computation that our bodies do?

2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:22.000
 Right. Well, let's talk about brains, primarily. I mean, I think the, the most important thing

2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:26.880
 about the things that our brains do is that we care about them in the sense that there's a lot

2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:32.960
 of computation going on out there in, you know, cellular automata and, you know, physical systems

2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:38.000
 and so on. And it just, it does what it does, it follows those rules, it does what it does.

2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:43.440
 The thing that's special about the computation in our brains is that it's connected to our goals

2:10:44.080 --> 2:10:49.520
 and our kind of whole societal story. And, you know, I think that's the, that's,

2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:53.840
 that's the special feature. And now the question then is, when you see this whole sort of ocean

2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:58.720
 of computation out there, how do you connect that to the things that we humans care about?

2:10:59.280 --> 2:11:03.520
 And in a sense, a large part of my life has been involved in sort of the technology of how to do

2:11:03.520 --> 2:11:08.720
 that. And, you know, what I've been interested in is kind of building computational language

2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:15.600
 that allows that something that both we humans can understand, and that can be used to determine

2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:20.400
 computations that are actually computations we care about. See, I think when you look at

2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:24.720
 something like one of these cellular automata, and it does some complicated thing, you say,

2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:31.760
 that's fun, but why do I care? Well, you could say the same thing actually in physics. You say,

2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:36.800
 oh, I've got this material and it's a ferrite or something. Why do I care? You know, some has

2:11:36.800 --> 2:11:41.920
 some magnetic properties. Why do I care? It's amusing, but why do I care? Well, we end up caring

2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:46.160
 because, you know, ferrite is what's used to make magnetic tape, magnetic disks, whatever.

2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:51.120
 Or, you know, we could use the crystals as made used to make, well, not that should

2:11:51.120 --> 2:11:56.480
 increasingly not, but it has been used to make computer displays and so on. But those are, so

2:11:56.480 --> 2:12:01.040
 in a sense, we're mining these things that happen to exist in the physical universe

2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:06.080
 and making it be something that we care about because we sort of entrain it into technology.

2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:12.640
 And it's the same thing in the computational universe that a lot of what's out there is stuff

2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:18.000
 that's just happening, but sometimes we have some objective and we will go and sort of mine the

2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:23.360
 computational universe for something that's useful for some particular objective. On a large scale,

2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:28.000
 trying to do that, trying to sort of navigate the computational universe to do useful things,

2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:33.280
 you know, that's where computational language comes in. And, you know, a lot of what I've

2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:38.480
 spent time doing and building this thing we call Wolfram Language, which I've been building for the

2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:48.320
 last one third of a century now. And kind of the goal there is to have a way to express kind of

2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:53.520
 computational thinking, computational thoughts in a way that both humans and machines can

2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:59.280
 understand. So it's kind of like in the tradition of computer languages, programming languages,

2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:05.920
 that the tradition there has been more, let's take what how computers are built, and let's

2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:11.680
 specify, let's have a human way to specify, do this, do this, do this at the level of the way

2:13:11.680 --> 2:13:16.720
 that computers are built. What I've been interested in is representing sort of the whole world

2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:22.480
 computationally, and being able to talk about whether it's about cities or chemicals or, you

2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:27.200
 know, this kind of algorithm or that kind of algorithm, things that have come to exist in

2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:31.840
 our civilization and the sort of knowledge base of our civilization, being able to talk directly

2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:37.600
 about those in a computational language, so that both we can understand it and computers can

2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:42.800
 understand it. I mean, the thing that I've been sort of excited about recently, which I had only

2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:48.080
 realized recently, which is kind of embarrassing, but it's kind of the arc of what we've tried to

2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:54.400
 do in building this kind of computational language is it's a similar kind of arc of what happened

2:13:54.400 --> 2:14:01.600
 when mathematical notation was invented. So go back 400 years, people were trying to do math,

2:14:01.600 --> 2:14:08.000
 they were always explaining their math in words. And it was pretty conky. And as soon as mathematical

2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:13.360
 notation was invented, you could start defining things like algebra and later calculus and so

2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:18.880
 on, it all became much more streamlined. When we deal with computational thinking about the world,

2:14:18.880 --> 2:14:23.200
 there's a question of what is the notation? What is the what is the kind of formalism that we can

2:14:23.200 --> 2:14:28.400
 use to talk about the world computationally? In a sense, that's what I've spent the last

2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:32.800
 third of a century trying to build. And we finally got to the point where we have a pretty full scale

2:14:32.800 --> 2:14:38.960
 computational language that sort of talks about the world. And that's, that's exciting, because

2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:44.800
 it means that just like having this mathematical notation, let us talk about the world mathematically,

2:14:45.360 --> 2:14:51.680
 we now and let us build up these kind of mathematical sciences. Now, we have a computational

2:14:51.680 --> 2:14:56.800
 language which allows us to start talking about the world computationally, and lets us, you know,

2:14:56.800 --> 2:15:03.200
 my view of it is it's kind of computational x for all x, all these different fields of, you know,

2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:06.800
 computational this, computational that, that's what we can now build.

2:15:06.800 --> 2:15:13.760
 Let's step back. So first of all, the mundane, what is Wolfram language in terms of

2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:21.760
 sort of, I mean, I can answer the question for you, but it's basically not the philosophical,

2:15:21.760 --> 2:15:26.160
 deep, the profound, the impact of it. I'm talking about in terms of tools, in terms of things you

2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:31.360
 can download and play with, what is it? What, what does it fit into the infrastructure? What

2:15:31.360 --> 2:15:35.680
 are the different ways to interact with it? Right. So I mean, the two big things that people have

2:15:35.680 --> 2:15:40.640
 sort of perhaps heard of that come from Wolfram language. One is Mathematica, the other is Wolfram

2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:49.280
 Alpha. So Mathematica first came out 1988. It's this system that is basically a instance of

2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:57.520
 Wolfram language. And it's used to do computations, particularly in sort of technical areas. And the

2:15:57.520 --> 2:16:01.680
 typical thing you're doing is you're typing little pieces of computational language,

2:16:01.680 --> 2:16:07.840
 and you're getting computations done. It's very kind of, there's like a symbolic,

2:16:09.040 --> 2:16:13.120
 yeah, it's a symbolic language. So symbolic language. So I mean, I don't know how to clean

2:16:13.120 --> 2:16:17.440
 and express that, but that makes it very distinct from what, how we think about sort of,

2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:23.440
 I don't know, programming in a language like Python or something. Right. So, so the point is that

2:16:23.440 --> 2:16:28.560
 in a traditional programming language, the raw material of the programming language is just stuff

2:16:28.560 --> 2:16:35.520
 that computers intrinsically do. And the point of Wolfram language is that what the language is

2:16:35.520 --> 2:16:41.760
 talking about is things that exist in the world, or things that we can imagine and construct, not,

2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:47.440
 it's not, it's not sort of, it's aimed to be an abstract language from the beginning. And so,

2:16:47.440 --> 2:16:52.000
 for example, one feature it has is that it's a symbolic language, which means that, you know,

2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:57.440
 the thing called, you'd have an X, just type in X. And Wolfram language would just say,

2:16:57.440 --> 2:17:02.640
 oh, that's X. It won't say error undefined thing. You know, I don't know what it is computation,

2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:09.040
 you know, in terms of the internals of computer. Now that X could perfectly well be, you know,

2:17:09.040 --> 2:17:14.240
 the city of Boston, that's a thing, that's a symbolic thing, or it could perfectly well be

2:17:14.800 --> 2:17:19.280
 the, you know, the trajectory of some spacecraft represented as a symbolic thing.

2:17:20.480 --> 2:17:26.640
 And that idea that one can work with sort of computationally work with these different,

2:17:26.640 --> 2:17:32.400
 these kinds of things that, that exist in the world or describe the world, that's really powerful.

2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:38.320
 And that's what, I mean, you know, when I started designing, well, when I designed the predecessor

2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:43.520
 of, of what's now Wolfram language, which is a thing called SMP, which was my first computer

2:17:43.520 --> 2:17:50.240
 language, I, I kind of wanted to have this, this sort of infrastructure for computation,

2:17:50.240 --> 2:17:54.640
 which was as fundamental as possible. I mean, this is what I got for having been a physicist and

2:17:54.640 --> 2:18:00.640
 tried to find, you know, fundamental components of things and wound up with this kind of idea of

2:18:01.600 --> 2:18:07.680
 transformation rules for symbolic expressions as being sort of the underlying stuff from which

2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:13.680
 computation would be built. And that's what we've been building from in Wolfram language.

2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:20.000
 And, you know, operationally, what happens, it's, I would say, by far the highest level

2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:26.240
 computer language that exists. And it's really been built in a very different direction from

2:18:26.240 --> 2:18:32.560
 other languages. So other languages have been about there is a core language, it really is kind

2:18:32.560 --> 2:18:37.600
 of wrapped around the operations that a computer intrinsically does. Maybe people add libraries

2:18:37.600 --> 2:18:43.920
 for this or that, that, but the goal of Wolfram language is to have the language itself be able

2:18:43.920 --> 2:18:48.560
 to cover this sort of very broad range of things that show up in the world. And that means that,

2:18:48.560 --> 2:18:54.400
 you know, there are 6,000 primitive functions in the Wolfram language that cover things, you know,

2:18:54.400 --> 2:19:00.880
 I could probably pick a random here, I'm going to pick just because just for fun, I'll pick them.

2:19:00.880 --> 2:19:08.720
 Let's take a random sample of all the things that we have here. So let's just say random

2:19:08.720 --> 2:19:14.960
 sample of 10 of them and let's see what we get. Wow, okay. So these are really different things

2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:20.080
 from these are all functions. These are all functions, Boolean convert. Okay, that's a thing

2:19:20.080 --> 2:19:26.000
 for converting between different types of Boolean expressions. So for people just listening,

2:19:26.800 --> 2:19:31.680
 Steven type 10 random sample of names, so this is sampling from all functions. How many you said

2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:37.680
 there might be 6,000 from 6,000 10 of them. And there's a hilarious variety of them.

2:19:37.680 --> 2:19:42.560
 Yeah, right. Well, we've got things about some dollar request or address that has to do with

2:19:42.560 --> 2:19:50.400
 interacting with the world of the cloud and so on, discrete wavelet data, spheroid.

2:19:50.400 --> 2:19:55.280
 Social graphical sort of window. Yeah, window movable. That's a user interface kind of thing.

2:19:55.280 --> 2:20:00.480
 I want to pick another 10 because I think this is some. Okay, so yeah, there's a lot of infrastructure

2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:04.160
 stuff here that you see if you just start sampling at random, there's a lot of kind of

2:20:04.160 --> 2:20:08.160
 infrastructural things. If you're more, you know, if you more look at the some of the exciting

2:20:08.160 --> 2:20:12.720
 machine learning stuff you showed off, is that also in this pool? Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, you

2:20:12.720 --> 2:20:18.480
 know, so one of those functions is like image identify as a function here. We just say image

2:20:18.480 --> 2:20:23.840
 identify. I don't know. It's always good to let's do this. Let's say current image and let's pick

2:20:23.840 --> 2:20:31.840
 up an image. Hopefully that's an image accessing the webcam to picture yourself. It took a terrible

2:20:31.840 --> 2:20:38.080
 picture. But anyway, we can say image identify open square brackets. And then we just paste

2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:42.800
 that picture in there. Image identify function running on the picture. Oh, and it says, oh,

2:20:42.800 --> 2:20:47.200
 wow, it says, I look like a plunger because I got this great big thing behind my.

2:20:47.200 --> 2:20:54.000
 Classify. So this image identify classifies the most likely object in the image. So it was a plunger.

2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:58.160
 Okay, that's a bit embarrassing. Let's see what it does. Let's pick the top 10.

2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:03.840
 Okay. Well, it thinks there's a, oh, it thinks it's pretty unlikely that it's a primary to

2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:10.160
 hominid a person 8% probability. Yeah, that's that's 57. It's a plunger. Yeah, well, hopefully

2:21:10.160 --> 2:21:17.280
 will not give you an existential crisis. And then 8% or I shouldn't say percent, but no,

2:21:17.280 --> 2:21:22.720
 that's right. 8% that it's a hominid. And yeah, okay, it's really I'm going to do another one

2:21:22.720 --> 2:21:28.720
 of these just because I'm embarrassed that it's not and didn't see me at all. There we go. Let's

2:21:28.720 --> 2:21:35.920
 try that. Let's see what that did. We took a picture with a little bit, a little bit more of me

2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:42.080
 and not just my bald head, so to speak. Okay, 89% probability it's a person. So that, so then I

2:21:42.080 --> 2:21:47.920
 would, but you know, so this is image identify as an example of one of just one of them, just one

2:21:47.920 --> 2:21:53.520
 function out of this part of the, that's like part of the whole language. Yes. I mean, you know,

2:21:53.520 --> 2:22:00.720
 something like I could say, I don't know, let's find the Geo nearest. What could we find? Let's

2:22:00.720 --> 2:22:10.480
 find the nearest volcano. Let's find the 10. I wonder where it thinks here is. Let's try finding

2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:18.640
 the 10 volcanoes nearest here. Okay, so Geo nearest volcano here 10 years volcanoes. Right,

2:22:18.640 --> 2:22:23.040
 let's find out where those are. We can now we've got a list of volcanoes out and I can say geolist

2:22:23.040 --> 2:22:29.440
 plot that and hopefully, okay, so there we go. So there's a map that shows the positions of

2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:34.720
 those 10 volcanoes of the east coast and the Midwest and well, no, we're okay. We're okay.

2:22:34.720 --> 2:22:38.080
 There's no, it's not too bad. Yeah, they're not very close to us. We could we could measure how

2:22:38.080 --> 2:22:43.920
 far away they are. But you know, the fact that right in the language, it knows about all the

2:22:43.920 --> 2:22:48.400
 volcanoes in the world, it knows, you know, computing what the nearest ones are, it knows

2:22:48.400 --> 2:22:51.760
 all the maps of the world and so on. It's a fundamentally different idea of what a language

2:22:51.760 --> 2:22:56.480
 is. Yeah, right. And that's, that's why I like to talk about as a, you know, full scale computational

2:22:56.480 --> 2:23:01.040
 language. That's, that's what we've tried to do. And just if you can comment briefly, I mean, this

2:23:01.040 --> 2:23:06.880
 kind of the Wolfram language, along with Wolfram Alpha represents kind of what the dream of what

2:23:06.880 --> 2:23:13.840
 AI is supposed to be. There's now a sort of a craze of learning kind of idea that we can take raw

2:23:13.840 --> 2:23:20.080
 data and from that extract the the different hierarchies of abstractions and in order to be

2:23:20.080 --> 2:23:27.360
 able to under like in order to form the kind of things that Wolfram language operates with.

2:23:27.360 --> 2:23:34.640
 But we're very far from learning systems be able to form that. Right. Like the context of history

2:23:34.640 --> 2:23:40.880
 of AI, if you could just comment on, there is a, you said computation X. And there's just some

2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:46.640
 sense where in the 80s and 90s sort of expert systems represented a very particular computation

2:23:46.640 --> 2:23:53.840
 X. Yes. Right. And there's a kind of notion that those efforts didn't pan out. Right. But then

2:23:53.840 --> 2:24:00.160
 out of that emerges kind of Wolfram language, Wolfram Alpha, which is the success. I mean,

2:24:00.160 --> 2:24:03.520
 yeah, right. I think those are in some sense, those efforts were too modest.

2:24:04.080 --> 2:24:08.880
 Right. They were, they were looking at particular areas. And you actually can't do it with a

2:24:08.880 --> 2:24:12.800
 particular area. I mean, like, like even a problem like natural language understanding,

2:24:12.800 --> 2:24:16.720
 it's critical to have broad knowledge of the world if you want to do good natural language

2:24:16.720 --> 2:24:21.440
 understanding. And you kind of have to bite off the whole problem. If you if you say we're just

2:24:21.440 --> 2:24:26.720
 going to do the blocks world over here, so to speak, you don't really, it's, it's, it's actually,

2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:30.720
 it's one of these cases where it's easier to do the whole thing than it is to do some piece of it.

2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:35.280
 You know, one comment to make about sort of the relationship between what we've tried to do and

2:24:35.280 --> 2:24:41.280
 sort of the learning side of AI. You know, in a sense, if you look at the development of knowledge

2:24:41.280 --> 2:24:46.960
 in our civilization as a whole, there was kind of this notion pre 300 years ago or so now,

2:24:46.960 --> 2:24:50.960
 you want to figure something out about the world, you can reason it out, you can do things which

2:24:50.960 --> 2:24:58.080
 would just use raw human thought. And then along came sort of modern mathematical science. And

2:24:58.080 --> 2:25:03.440
 we found ways to just sort of blast through that by in that case, writing down equations.

2:25:03.440 --> 2:25:08.320
 Now we also know we can do that with computation and so on. And so that was kind of a different

2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:14.880
 thing. So when we look at how do we sort of encode knowledge and figure things out, one way we

2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:19.760
 could do it is start from scratch, learn everything, it's just a neural net figuring everything out.

2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:26.160
 But in a sense that denies the sort of knowledge based achievements of our civilization,

2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:30.880
 because in our civilization, we have learned lots of stuff, we've surveyed all the volcanoes in the

2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:35.840
 world, we've done, you know, we've figured out lots of algorithms for this or that. Those are

2:25:35.840 --> 2:25:41.280
 things that we can encode computationally. And that's what we've tried to do. And we're not saying

2:25:41.280 --> 2:25:46.000
 just, you don't have to start everything from scratch. So in a sense, a big part of what we've

2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:52.480
 done is to try and sort of capture the knowledge of the world in computational form and computable

2:25:52.480 --> 2:25:59.680
 form. Now, there's also some pieces which were for a long time undoable by computers like image

2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:06.000
 identification, where there's a really, really useful module that we can add that is those

2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:10.800
 things which actually were pretty easy for humans to do that had been hard for computers to do.

2:26:10.800 --> 2:26:14.560
 I think the thing that's interesting that's emerging now is the interplay between these

2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:19.680
 things between this kind of knowledge of the world, that is in a sense very symbolic, and this kind

2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:27.840
 of sort of much more statistical kind of things like image identification and so on, and putting

2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:34.240
 those together by having this sort of symbolic representation of image identification, that's

2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:38.400
 where things get really interesting and where you can kind of symbolically represent patterns of

2:26:38.400 --> 2:26:44.560
 things and images and so on. I think that's, you know, that's kind of a part of the path forward,

2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:50.480
 so to speak. Yeah, so the dream of the machine learning is not, in my view, I think the view

2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:57.680
 of many people is not anywhere close to building the kind of wide world of computable knowledge

2:26:57.680 --> 2:27:04.800
 that Wolfram language have built, but because you have a kind of, you've done the incredibly

2:27:04.800 --> 2:27:11.120
 hard work of building this world, now machine learning can be, can serve as tools to help

2:27:11.120 --> 2:27:15.840
 you explore that world. Yeah, yeah. And that's what you've added, I mean, with the version 12,

2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:21.520
 right, you added a few, I was seeing some demos, it looks amazing. Right, I mean, I think, you know,

2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:28.480
 this, it's sort of interesting to see the, there's sort of the once it's computable, once it's in

2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:32.640
 there, it's running in sort of a very efficient computational way. But then there's sort of

2:27:32.640 --> 2:27:35.920
 things like the interface of how do you get there, you know, how do you do natural language

2:27:35.920 --> 2:27:40.160
 understanding to get there, how do you, how do you pick out entities in a big piece of text or

2:27:40.160 --> 2:27:47.520
 something. That's, I mean, actually a good example right now is our NLP NLU loop, which is we've done

2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:53.040
 a lot of stuff, natural language understanding, using essentially not learning based methods,

2:27:53.040 --> 2:27:58.320
 using a lot of, you know, out little algorithmic methods, human curation methods and so on,

2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:04.000
 just when people try to enter a query, and then converting to the process of converting,

2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:11.360
 NLU defined beautifully as converting their query into computational, into a computational

2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:17.360
 language, which is a very well, first of all, super practical definition, very useful definition,

2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:21.840
 and then also a very clear definition of natural language understanding.

2:28:21.840 --> 2:28:25.520
 Right. I mean, a different thing is natural language processing where it's like,

2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:30.960
 here's a big lump of text, go pick out all the cities in that text, for example. And so a good

2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:35.840
 example of, you know, so we do that, we're using, using modern machine learning techniques.

2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:41.280
 And it's actually kind of kind of an interesting process that's going on right now is this loop

2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:47.920
 between what do we pick up with NLP using machine learning versus what do we pick up with our more

2:28:47.920 --> 2:28:51.840
 kind of precise computational methods and natural language understanding.

2:28:51.840 --> 2:28:55.440
 And so we've got this kind of loop going between those, which is improving both of them.

2:28:55.440 --> 2:28:58.640
 Yeah. And I think you have some of the state of the art transformers. You have Burt in there,

2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:02.800
 I think. Oh, yeah. So it's, of course, you have, you have integrating all the models. I mean,

2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:07.520
 this is the hybrid thing that people have always dreamed about or talking about.

2:29:07.520 --> 2:29:15.200
 I'm actually just surprised, frankly, that Wolfram language is not more popular than it already is.

2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:20.160
 You know, that's, that's a, that's a, it's a, it's a complicated issue because it's like,

2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:29.280
 it involves, you know, it involves ideas and ideas are absorbed, absorbed slowly in the world.

2:29:29.280 --> 2:29:32.000
 I mean, I think that's, and then there's sort of like what we're talking about,

2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:39.040
 there's egos and personalities and some of the, the absorption, absorption mechanisms of ideas

2:29:39.040 --> 2:29:44.480
 have to do with personalities and the students of personalities and the, and then a little

2:29:44.480 --> 2:29:48.320
 social network. So it's, it's interesting how the spread of ideas works.

2:29:48.320 --> 2:29:54.400
 You know, what's funny with Wolfram language is that we are, if you say, you know, what market,

2:29:54.400 --> 2:30:00.880
 sort of market penetration, if you look at the, I would say very high end of R&D and sort of the,

2:30:00.880 --> 2:30:05.280
 the people where you say, wow, that's a really, you know, impressive smart person,

2:30:05.920 --> 2:30:09.600
 they're very often users of, of, of Wolfram language very, very often.

2:30:09.600 --> 2:30:14.240
 If you look at the more sort of, it's a funny thing. If you look at the more kind of, I would say,

2:30:14.800 --> 2:30:17.840
 people who are like, oh, we're just plotting away doing what we do.

2:30:19.040 --> 2:30:24.480
 They're often not yet, Wolfram language users and that dynamic is kind of odd that there hasn't been

2:30:24.480 --> 2:30:29.600
 more rapid trickle down because we've really, you know, the high end, we've really been very

2:30:29.600 --> 2:30:36.480
 successful in for a long time. And it's, it's some, but was, you know, that's partly, I think,

2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:42.800
 a consequence of my fault in a sense, because it's kind of, you know, I have a company which

2:30:42.800 --> 2:30:51.440
 is really emphasizes sort of creating products and building a sort of the best possible

2:30:51.440 --> 2:30:58.160
 technical tower we can, rather than sort of doing the commercial side of things and pumping it out

2:30:58.160 --> 2:31:01.840
 and sort of the most effective way. And there's an interesting idea that, you know,

2:31:01.840 --> 2:31:07.440
 perhaps you can make it more popular by opening everything, everything up sort of the GitHub

2:31:07.440 --> 2:31:12.160
 model. But there's an interesting, I think I've heard you discuss this, that that turns out not

2:31:12.160 --> 2:31:18.320
 to work in a lot of cases, like in this particular case that you want it, that, that when you deeply

2:31:18.320 --> 2:31:27.360
 care about the integrity, the quality of the knowledge that you're building, that unfortunately

2:31:27.360 --> 2:31:34.800
 you can't, you can't distribute that effort. Yeah, it's not the nature of how things work. I mean,

2:31:34.800 --> 2:31:40.240
 you know, what we're trying to do is a thing that for better or worse, requires leadership,

2:31:40.240 --> 2:31:46.640
 and it requires kind of maintaining a coherent vision over a long period of time, and doing

2:31:46.640 --> 2:31:52.960
 not only the cool vision related work, but also the kind of mundane and the trenches make the

2:31:52.960 --> 2:31:58.480
 thing actually work well, work. So how do you build the knowledge? Because that's the fascinating

2:31:58.480 --> 2:32:03.360
 thing. That's the mundane, the fascinating and the mundane is building the knowledge,

2:32:03.360 --> 2:32:08.240
 the adding, integrating more data. Yeah, I mean, that's probably not the most, I mean, the things

2:32:08.240 --> 2:32:13.040
 like get it to work in all these different cloud environments and so on. That's pretty,

2:32:13.040 --> 2:32:17.360
 you know, it's very practical stuff, you know, have the user interface be smooth and, you know,

2:32:17.360 --> 2:32:21.360
 have there be take only, you know, a fraction of a millisecond to do this or that.

2:32:21.360 --> 2:32:29.360
 That's a lot of work. And it's, but, you know, I think my, it's an interesting thing over the

2:32:29.360 --> 2:32:34.480
 period of time, you know, often language has existed basically for more than half of the

2:32:34.480 --> 2:32:38.480
 total amount of time that any language, any computer language has existed. That is,

2:32:38.480 --> 2:32:46.080
 computer language is maybe 60 years old, you know, give or take, and often language is 33 years old.

2:32:46.080 --> 2:32:52.480
 So it's, it's kind of a, and I think I was realizing recently there's been more innovation

2:32:52.480 --> 2:32:57.520
 in the distribution of software than probably than in the structure of programming languages

2:32:57.520 --> 2:33:03.600
 over that period of time. And we, you know, we've been sort of trying to do our best to adapt to

2:33:03.600 --> 2:33:08.560
 it. And the good news is that we have, you know, because I have a simple private company and so

2:33:08.560 --> 2:33:13.680
 on that doesn't have, you know, a bunch of investors, you know, telling us we got to do this so that

2:33:13.680 --> 2:33:18.800
 we have lots of freedom in what we can do. And so for example, we're able to, oh, I don't know,

2:33:18.800 --> 2:33:23.120
 we have this free Wolfram engine for developers, which is a free version for developers. And we've

2:33:23.120 --> 2:33:28.480
 been, you know, we've, there are site licenses for, for mathematical and Wolfram language at

2:33:28.480 --> 2:33:34.320
 basically all major universities, certainly in the US by now. So it's effectively free to people

2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:41.200
 and all universities in effect. And, you know, we've been doing a progression of things. I mean,

2:33:41.200 --> 2:33:45.840
 different things like Wolfram Alpha, for example, the main website is just a free website.

2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:52.560
 What is Wolfram Alpha? Okay, Wolfram Alpha is a system for answering questions where

2:33:52.560 --> 2:33:57.840
 you ask a question with natural language, and it'll try and generate a report telling you the

2:33:57.840 --> 2:34:04.000
 answer to that question. So the question could be something like, you know, what's the population

2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:10.400
 of Boston divided by New York, compared to New York, and it'll take those words and give you

2:34:10.400 --> 2:34:17.520
 an answer. And that converts the words into computable, into, into Wolfram language, actually,

2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:21.920
 into Wolfram language, and then computational language, and then do you think then underlying

2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:26.480
 knowledge belongs to Wolfram Alpha or to the Wolfram language? What's the, we just call it the

2:34:26.480 --> 2:34:31.520
 Wolfram knowledge base, knowledge base. I mean, it's, it's been a, that's been a big effort over

2:34:31.520 --> 2:34:35.840
 the decades to collect all that stuff and, you know, more of it flows in every second. So

2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:41.360
 can you, can you just pause on that for a second? Like, that's one of the most incredible things.

2:34:41.360 --> 2:34:48.240
 Of course, in the long term, Wolfram language itself is the fundamental thing. But in the

2:34:48.240 --> 2:34:54.960
 amazing sort of short term, the, the knowledge base is kind of incredible. So what's the process

2:34:54.960 --> 2:34:59.440
 of building in that knowledge base? The fact that you first of all, from the very beginning,

2:34:59.440 --> 2:35:07.120
 that you're brave enough to start to take on the general knowledge base. And how do you go from

2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:12.720
 zero to the incredible knowledge base that you have now? Well, yeah, it was kind of scary at

2:35:12.720 --> 2:35:16.880
 some level. I mean, I had, I had wondered about doing something like this since I was a kid.

2:35:16.880 --> 2:35:22.320
 So it wasn't like I hadn't thought about it for a while. But most of us, most of the brilliant

2:35:22.320 --> 2:35:28.160
 dreamers give up such a, such a difficult engineering notion at some point. Right. Right.

2:35:28.160 --> 2:35:33.680
 Well, the thing that happened with me, which was kind of, it's a, it's a live your own paradigm

2:35:33.680 --> 2:35:39.840
 kind of theory. So basically what happened is I had assumed that to build something like Wolfmalpha

2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:44.960
 would require sort of solving the general AI problem. That's what I had assumed. And so I

2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:48.720
 kept on thinking about that. And I thought I don't really know how to do that. So I don't do

2:35:48.720 --> 2:35:53.760
 anything. Then I worked on my new kind of science project instead of exploring the computational

2:35:53.760 --> 2:35:57.680
 universe and came up with things like this principle of computational equivalence,

2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:02.800
 which say there is no bright line between the intelligent and the merely computational.

2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:09.040
 So I thought, look, that's this paradigm I've built. Now it's, now I have to eat that dog food

2:36:09.040 --> 2:36:13.280
 myself, so to speak. I've been thinking about doing this thing with computable knowledge

2:36:13.280 --> 2:36:20.320
 forever. And let me actually try and do it. And so it was, if my paradigm is right,

2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:25.040
 then this should be possible. But the beginning was certainly, it was a bit daunting. I remember

2:36:25.040 --> 2:36:30.480
 I took the early team to a big reference library. And we're like looking at this reference

2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:36.240
 library. And it's like, my basic statement is our goal over the next year or two is to ingest

2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:43.280
 everything that's in here. And that's, it seemed very daunting. But in a sense, I was well aware

2:36:43.280 --> 2:36:47.200
 of the fact that it's finite, the fact that you can walk into the reference library. It's a big,

2:36:47.200 --> 2:36:52.240
 big thing with lots of reference books all over the place. But it is finite. This is not an

2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:58.240
 infinite, you know, it's not the infinite corridor of, so to speak, of reference libraries, not truly

2:36:58.240 --> 2:37:03.600
 infinite, so to speak. But, but no, I mean, and then, then what happened was sort of interesting

2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:10.160
 there was from a methodology point of view was, I didn't start off saying, let me have a grand

2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:15.760
 theory for how all this knowledge works. It was like, let's, you know, implement this area, this

2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:22.960
 area, this area of a few hundred areas and so on. It's a lot of work. I also found that, you know,

2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:31.680
 I've been fortunate in that our products get used by sort of the world's experts in lots of areas.

2:37:31.680 --> 2:37:36.800
 And so that really helped because we were able to ask people, you know, the world expert in this

2:37:36.800 --> 2:37:41.840
 or that, you know, we're able to ask them for input and so on. And I found that my general

2:37:41.840 --> 2:37:47.680
 principle was that any area where there wasn't some expert who helped us figure out what to do

2:37:48.320 --> 2:37:52.880
 wouldn't be right. You know, because our goal was to kind of get to the point where we had

2:37:52.880 --> 2:37:57.520
 sort of true expert level knowledge about everything. And so that, you know, that the

2:37:57.520 --> 2:38:02.400
 ultimate goal is if there's a question that can be answered on the basis of general knowledge and

2:38:02.400 --> 2:38:07.600
 our civilization, make it be automatic to be able to answer that question. And, you know, and now,

2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:12.480
 well, Wolfmalfa got used in Siri from the very beginning, and it's now also used in Alexa. And

2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:18.480
 so it's people are kind of getting more of the, you know, they get more of the sense of this is

2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:24.720
 what should be possible to do. I mean, in a sense, the question answering problem was viewed as one

2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:30.080
 of the sort of core AI problems for a long time. And I had kind of an interesting experience. I had

2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:37.520
 a friend, Marvin Minsky, who was a well known AI person from right around here. And so I had

2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:42.880
 a friend, and I remember when Wolfmalfa was coming out, there was a few weeks before it came out,

2:38:42.880 --> 2:38:48.160
 I think, I happened to see Marvin. And I said, I should show you this thing we have, you know,

2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:54.720
 it's a question answering system. And he was like, okay, type something in, it's like, okay, fine.

2:38:54.720 --> 2:39:00.000
 And then he's talking about something different. I said, no, Marvin, you know, this time, it actually

2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:04.960
 works. You know, look at this, it actually works. He's typed in a few more things. There's maybe

2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:08.640
 10 more things. Of course, we have a record of what he typed in, which is kind of interesting.

2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:15.760
 Can you share where his mind was in the testing space?

2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:20.960
 All kinds of random things. He's just trying random stuff, you know, medical stuff and,

2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:25.360
 you know, chemistry stuff and, you know, astronomy and so on. I think it was like,

2:39:25.360 --> 2:39:29.920
 like, you know, after a few minutes, he was like, oh, my God, it actually works.

2:39:29.920 --> 2:39:37.360
 But that was kind of told you something about the state, you know, what happened in AI? Because

2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:42.080
 people had, you know, in a sense, by trying to solve the bigger problem, we were able to

2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:46.480
 actually make something that would work. Now, to be fair, you know, we had a bunch of completely

2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:51.120
 unfair advantages. For example, we already built a bunch of awful language, which was,

2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:57.760
 you know, very high level symbolic language. We had, you know, I had the practical experience

2:39:57.760 --> 2:40:04.000
 of building big systems. I have the sort of intellectual confidence to not just sort of

2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:11.920
 give up and doing something like this. I think that the, you know, it is a, it's always a funny

2:40:11.920 --> 2:40:17.120
 thing, you know, I've worked on a bunch of big projects in my life. And I would say that the,

2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:22.480
 you know, you mentioned ego, I would also mention optimism. So it doesn't be, I mean,

2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:29.600
 in, you know, if somebody said, this project is going to take 30 years, it's, you know,

2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:35.840
 it would be hard to sell me on that. You know, I'm always in the, in the, well, I can kind of see

2:40:35.840 --> 2:40:40.320
 a few years, you know, something's going to happen in a few years. And usually it does,

2:40:40.320 --> 2:40:45.760
 something happens in a few years, but the whole, the tail can be decades long. And that's a,

2:40:45.760 --> 2:40:49.440
 that's a, you know, and from a personal point of view, always the challenge is,

2:40:49.440 --> 2:40:53.760
 you end up with these projects that have infinite tails. And the question is,

2:40:53.760 --> 2:40:59.440
 do the tails kind of, do you just drown in kind of dealing with all of the tails of these projects?

2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:04.880
 And that's, that's an interesting sort of personal challenge. And like,

2:41:04.880 --> 2:41:09.040
 my efforts now to work on fundamental theory of physics, which I've just started doing,

2:41:09.600 --> 2:41:15.360
 and I'm having a lot of fun with it. But it's kind of, you know, it's, it's kind of making

2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:22.800
 a bet that I can, I can kind of, you know, I can do that as well as doing the incredibly energetic

2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:26.960
 things that I'm trying to do with awful language and so on. I mean, the vision, yeah.

2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:32.640
 And underlying that, I mean, I just talked for the second time with Elon Musk and that you two

2:41:32.640 --> 2:41:40.160
 share that quality a little bit of that optimism of taking on basically the daunting, what most

2:41:40.160 --> 2:41:47.840
 people call impossible. And he and you take it on out of, you can call it ego, you can call it

2:41:47.840 --> 2:41:52.400
 naivety, you can call it optimism, whatever the heck it is. But that's how you solve the impossible

2:41:52.400 --> 2:41:57.120
 things. Yeah, I mean, look at what happens. And I don't know, you know, in my own case,

2:41:58.560 --> 2:42:03.600
 you know, it's been, I progressively got a bit more confident and progressively able to,

2:42:03.600 --> 2:42:07.760
 you know, decide that these projects aren't crazy. But then the other thing is the other,

2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:13.120
 the other trap that one can end up with is, Oh, I've done these projects and they're big.

2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:17.200
 Let me never do a project that's any smaller than any project I've done so far.

2:42:18.080 --> 2:42:22.800
 And that's, you know, and that can be a trap. And often these projects are

2:42:23.520 --> 2:42:29.440
 of completely unknown, you know, that their depth and significance is actually very hard to know.

2:42:29.440 --> 2:42:37.040
 Yeah. On the sort of building this giant knowledge base that's behind Wolfram language,

2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:45.680
 Wolfram Alpha. What do you think about the internet? What do you think about, for example,

2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:53.360
 Wikipedia, these large aggregations of texts that's not converted into computable knowledge?

2:42:53.360 --> 2:43:00.720
 Do you think, if you look at Wolfram language, Wolfram Alpha 2030, maybe 50 years down the line,

2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:08.880
 do you hope to store all of the sort of Google's dream is to make all information searchable,

2:43:09.440 --> 2:43:16.160
 accessible? But that's really, as defined, it's, it's a, it doesn't include the understanding

2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:25.440
 of information. Right. Do you hope to make all of knowledge represented within, I would hope so.

2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:29.040
 That's what we're trying to do. I mean, how hard is that problem? Like closing that gap?

2:43:29.600 --> 2:43:33.440
 What's your sense? Well, it depends on the use cases. I mean, so if it's a question of

2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:36.800
 answering general knowledge questions about the world, we're in pretty good shape on that right

2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:44.800
 now. If it's a question of representing like an area that we're going into right now is computational

2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:50.800
 contracts, being able to take something which would be written in legalese, it might even be

2:43:50.800 --> 2:43:55.200
 the specifications for, you know, what should the self driving car do when it encounters this or that

2:43:55.200 --> 2:44:00.640
 or the other? What should the, you know, whatever, the, you know, write that in a computational

2:44:00.640 --> 2:44:06.240
 language and be able to express things about the world. You know, if the creature that you see

2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:12.080
 running across the road is a, you know, thing at this point in the evil, you know, tree of life,

2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:15.600
 then swerve this way, otherwise don't, those kinds of things.

2:44:15.600 --> 2:44:20.240
 Are there ethical components when you start to get to some of the messy human things,

2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:22.720
 are those encodeable into computable knowledge?

2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:29.840
 Well, I think that it is a necessary feature of attempting to automate more in the world

2:44:29.840 --> 2:44:36.960
 that we encode more and more of ethics in a way that gets sort of quickly, you know, is able to

2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:41.520
 be dealt with by computer. I mean, I've been involved recently, I sort of got backed into

2:44:41.520 --> 2:44:47.600
 being involved in the question of automated content selection on the internet. So, you know,

2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:53.040
 the Facebook, Google's, Twitter's, you know, what, how do they rank the stuff they feed to us humans,

2:44:53.040 --> 2:44:58.480
 so to speak. And the question of what are, you know, what should never be fed to us? What should

2:44:58.480 --> 2:45:03.120
 be blocked forever? What should be upranked, you know, and what is the, what are the kind of

2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:08.480
 principles behind that? And what I kind of, well, a bunch of different things are realized about

2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:14.640
 that. But one thing that's interesting is being able, you know, in fact, you're building sort of an

2:45:14.640 --> 2:45:20.960
 AI ethics, you have to build an AI ethics module in effect to decide, is this thing so shocking,

2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:26.640
 I'm never going to show it to people, is this thing so whatever. And I did realize in thinking

2:45:26.640 --> 2:45:31.520
 about that, that, you know, there's not going to be one of these things, it's not possible to decide,

2:45:31.520 --> 2:45:36.720
 or it might be possible, but it would be really bad for the future of our species if we just decided

2:45:36.720 --> 2:45:43.600
 there's this one AI ethics module, and it's going to determine the practices of everything in the

2:45:43.600 --> 2:45:48.320
 world, so to speak. And I kind of realized one has to sort of break it up. And that's an interesting

2:45:48.320 --> 2:45:54.720
 societal problem of how one does that, and how one sort of has people sort of self identify for,

2:45:54.720 --> 2:45:58.480
 you know, I'm buying in, in the case of just content selection, it's sort of easier,

2:45:58.480 --> 2:46:01.760
 because it's like an individual, it's for an individual, it's not something that

2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:08.400
 kind of cuts across sort of societal boundaries. But it's a really interesting notion

2:46:09.680 --> 2:46:18.240
 of, I heard you describe, I really like it sort of, maybe in the sort of have different AI systems

2:46:18.240 --> 2:46:22.800
 that have a certain kind of brand that they represent essentially, you can have like, I don't

2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:29.120
 know, whether it's conservative or liberal and then libertarian, and there's an

2:46:29.120 --> 2:46:35.280
 Randian, Objectivist AI system, and different ethical, I mean, it's almost

2:46:36.240 --> 2:46:40.800
 encoding some of the ideologies which we've been struggling, I come from the Soviet Union,

2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:45.200
 that didn't work out so well with the with the ideologies they worked out there. And so you

2:46:45.200 --> 2:46:52.720
 have, but they all, everybody purchased that particular ethics system, and in the same I

2:46:52.720 --> 2:47:00.240
 suppose could be done encoded, that that system could be encoded into computational knowledge,

2:47:00.240 --> 2:47:05.040
 and allow us to explore in the realm of individual spaces, that's a really exciting

2:47:05.600 --> 2:47:09.520
 possibility. Are you playing with those ideas in Wolfram language?

2:47:10.080 --> 2:47:14.400
 Yeah, yeah, I mean, the, you know, that's we, Wolfram language has sort of the best

2:47:14.960 --> 2:47:19.360
 opportunity to kind of express those essentially computational contracts about what to do.

2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:24.880
 Now, there's a bunch more work to be done to do it in practice for, you know, deciding the

2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:29.360
 is this incredible news story, what does that mean or whatever, whatever else you're going to pick.

2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:36.800
 I think that that's, you know, that's the question of exactly what we get to do with that is,

2:47:38.320 --> 2:47:43.280
 you know, for me, it's kind of a complicated thing, because there are these big projects

2:47:43.280 --> 2:47:46.720
 that I think about, like, you know, find the fundamental theory of physics, okay, that's

2:47:46.720 --> 2:47:52.240
 box number one, right? Box number two, you know, solve the AI ethics problem in the case of,

2:47:52.240 --> 2:47:56.640
 you know, figure out how you rank all content, so to speak, and decide what people see,

2:47:57.200 --> 2:48:01.440
 that's kind of a box number two, so to speak. These are big projects. And I think

2:48:01.440 --> 2:48:05.200
 What do you think is more important? The fundamental nature of reality or

2:48:06.160 --> 2:48:10.400
 Friends who you ask, it's one of these things it's exactly like, you know, what's the ranking,

2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:15.520
 right? It's the, it's the ranking system. It's like, who's, who's module do you use to rank that?

2:48:15.520 --> 2:48:21.840
 If you, and I think, but having multiple modules is a really compelling notion to us humans,

2:48:21.840 --> 2:48:25.040
 that in a world where there's not clear that there's a right answer,

2:48:25.840 --> 2:48:35.200
 it perhaps you have systems that operate under different, how would you say it? I mean,

2:48:35.760 --> 2:48:39.840
 it's different value systems, different value systems. I mean, I think, you know, in a sense,

2:48:39.840 --> 2:48:46.640
 the, I mean, I'm not really a politics oriented person, but, but you know, in the kind of totalitarian

2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:52.320
 ism, it's kind of like, you're going to have this, this system, and that's the way it is. I mean,

2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:58.560
 kind of the, you know, the concept of sort of a market based system, where you have, okay, I as a

2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:03.360
 human, I'm going to pick this system, I as another human, I'm going to pick this system. I mean,

2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:10.800
 that's in a sense, this case of automated content selection is a non trivial, but it is probably

2:49:10.800 --> 2:49:15.840
 the easiest of the AI ethics situations, because it is each person gets to pick for themselves.

2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:21.200
 And there's not a huge interplay between what different people pick. By the time you're dealing

2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:27.120
 with other societal things, like, you know, what should the policy of the central bank be or something?

2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:30.560
 Yeah, or healthcare system or some of all those kind of centralized kind of things.

2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:35.040
 Right. Well, I mean, healthcare again has the feature that, that at some level, each person

2:49:35.040 --> 2:49:39.120
 can pick for themselves, so to speak. I mean, whereas there are other things where there's a

2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:45.040
 necessary public health as one example, where that's not, where that doesn't get to be, you know,

2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:49.600
 something which people can, what they pick for themselves, they may impose on other people,

2:49:49.600 --> 2:49:53.200
 and then it becomes a more non trivial piece of sort of political philosophy.

2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:56.800
 Of course, the central banking system, so would argue, we would move, we need to move

2:49:56.800 --> 2:50:02.240
 into digital currency and so on and Bitcoin and ledgers and so on. So there's a lot of,

2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:07.200
 we've been quite involved in that. And that's where that's sort of the motivation for computational

2:50:07.200 --> 2:50:12.880
 contracts in part comes out of, you know, this idea, oh, we can just have this autonomously

2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:17.840
 executing smart contract. The idea of a computational contract is just to say,

2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:23.440
 you know, have something where all of the conditions of the contract are represented

2:50:23.440 --> 2:50:27.600
 in computational form. So in principle, it's automatic to execute the contract.

2:50:28.560 --> 2:50:33.920
 And I think that's, you know, that will surely be the future of, you know, the idea of legal

2:50:33.920 --> 2:50:38.880
 contracts written in English or legal ease or whatever, and where people have to argue

2:50:38.880 --> 2:50:46.480
 about what goes on is surely not, you know, we have a much more streamlined process,

2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:50.400
 if everything can be represented computationally and the computers can kind of decide what to do.

2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:56.320
 I mean, ironically enough, you know, old Gottfried Leibniz back in the 1600s

2:50:56.320 --> 2:51:01.920
 was saying exactly the same thing. But he had, you know, his pinnacle of technical achievement

2:51:01.920 --> 2:51:06.880
 was this brass four function mechanical calculator thing that never really worked properly,

2:51:06.880 --> 2:51:14.400
 actually. And, you know, so he was like 300 years too early for that idea. But now that idea is

2:51:14.400 --> 2:51:19.120
 pretty realistic, I think. And, you know, you ask how much more difficult is it than what we have

2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:24.320
 now and more from language to express, I call it symbolic discourse language, being able to

2:51:24.320 --> 2:51:31.040
 express sort of everything in the world in kind of computational symbolic form. I think it is

2:51:31.040 --> 2:51:35.040
 absolutely within reach. I mean, I think it's a, you know, I don't know, maybe I'm just too much

2:51:35.040 --> 2:51:39.760
 of an optimist, but I think it's a it's a limited number of years to have a pretty well built out

2:51:39.760 --> 2:51:45.600
 version of that, that will allow one to encode the kinds of things that are relevant to typical

2:51:45.600 --> 2:51:52.720
 legal contracts and these kinds of things. The idea of symbolic discourse language,

2:51:52.720 --> 2:52:01.200
 can you try to define the scope of what it is? So we're having a conversation. It's a natural

2:52:01.200 --> 2:52:07.440
 language. Can we have a representation of the sort of actionable parts of that conversation

2:52:08.160 --> 2:52:13.840
 in a precise computable form so that a computer could go do it? And not just contracts, but really

2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:20.000
 sort of some of the things we think of as common sense, essentially, even just like basic notions

2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:25.920
 of human life. Well, I mean, things like, you know, I am, I'm getting hungry and want to eat

2:52:25.920 --> 2:52:30.000
 something, right? That that's something we don't have a representation, you know, in more from

2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:33.920
 language right now, if I was like, I'm eating blueberries and raspberries and things like

2:52:33.920 --> 2:52:38.320
 that, and I'm eating this amount of them, we know all about those kinds of fruits and plants and

2:52:38.320 --> 2:52:43.600
 nutrition content and all that kind of thing. But the I want to eat them part of it is not covered.

2:52:43.600 --> 2:52:49.600
 Yet. And that, you know, you need to do that in order to have a complete symbolic discourse

2:52:49.600 --> 2:52:54.560
 language to be able to have a natural language conversation. Right. Right. To be able to express

2:52:54.560 --> 2:53:00.320
 the kinds of things that say, you know, if it's a legal contract, it's, you know, the part is desire

2:53:00.320 --> 2:53:05.520
 to have this and that. And that's, you know, that's a thing like I want to eat a raspberry or something.

2:53:05.520 --> 2:53:12.000
 But isn't that the, isn't this, just like you said, it's centuries old, this dream?

2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:20.240
 Yes. But it's also the more near term, the dream of touring and formulating a touring test.

2:53:20.240 --> 2:53:32.160
 Yes. So do you hope, do you think that's the ultimate test of creating something special?

2:53:32.160 --> 2:53:38.880
 Because we said, I don't know. I think my special, look, if the test is, does it walk and talk like

2:53:38.880 --> 2:53:46.160
 a human? Well, that's just the talking like a human. But the answer is, it's an okay test.

2:53:46.160 --> 2:53:51.120
 If you say, is it a test of intelligence? You know, people have attached Wolf Malfur,

2:53:51.120 --> 2:53:56.880
 the Wolf Malfur API to, you know, touring test bots. And those bots just lose immediately.

2:53:56.880 --> 2:54:02.000
 Because all you have to do is ask it five questions that, you know, are about really obscure weird

2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:05.920
 pieces of knowledge. And it's just trot them right out. And you say, that's not a human.

2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:10.240
 Right? It's a, it's a different thing. It's achieving a different, you know,

2:54:10.240 --> 2:54:16.320
 right now. But it's, I would argue not, I would argue, it's not a different thing. It's actually

2:54:16.320 --> 2:54:23.440
 legitimately, Wolf Malfur is legitimately, Wolf Malfur language only is legitimately trying to

2:54:23.440 --> 2:54:28.320
 solve the touring, the intent of the touring test. Perhaps the intent. Yeah, perhaps the intent.

2:54:28.320 --> 2:54:33.120
 I mean, it's actually kind of fun, you know, on touring, trying to work out, he thought about

2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:37.840
 taking Encyclopedia Britannica and, you know, making it computational in some way. And he

2:54:37.840 --> 2:54:42.800
 estimated how much work it would be. And actually, I have to say, he was a bit more pessimistic than

2:54:42.800 --> 2:54:46.400
 the reality. We did it more efficiently than that. But to him that represented.

2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:52.160
 So I mean, he was, he was on the mighty mental task. Yeah, right. He was, he had the same idea.

2:54:52.160 --> 2:54:56.080
 I mean, it was, you know, we were able to do it more efficiently because we had a lot,

2:54:56.080 --> 2:55:01.840
 we had layers of automation that he, I think hadn't, you know, it's, it's hard to imagine those

2:55:01.840 --> 2:55:06.800
 layers of abstraction that end up being, being built up. But to him, it represented

2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:10.960
 like an impossible task, essentially. Well, he thought it was difficult. He thought it was,

2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:13.920
 you know, maybe if he'd lived another 50 years, he would have been able to do it. I don't know.

2:55:14.640 --> 2:55:21.840
 In the interest of time, easy questions. Go through. What is intelligence? You talk about.

2:55:21.840 --> 2:55:29.360
 I love the way you say easy questions. Yeah. You talked about sort of rule 30 and

2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:37.520
 cellular automata humbling your sense of human beings having a monopoly and intelligence. But

2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:43.600
 in your, in retrospect, just looking broadly now with all the things you learn from computation,

2:55:43.600 --> 2:55:48.560
 what is intelligence? How does intelligence arise? Yeah, I don't think there's a bright

2:55:48.560 --> 2:55:55.760
 line of what intelligence is. I think intelligence is at some level just computation. But for us,

2:55:55.760 --> 2:56:01.360
 intelligence is defined to be computation that is doing things we care about. And, you know, that's,

2:56:02.720 --> 2:56:07.600
 that's a very special definition. It's a very, you know, when you try and, try and make it up,

2:56:07.600 --> 2:56:11.280
 you know, you try and say, well, intelligence to this is problem solving. It's doing general

2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:16.240
 this, it's doing that. This doesn't the other thing. It's, it's operating within a human environment

2:56:16.240 --> 2:56:21.200
 type thing. Okay. You know, that's fine. If you say, well, what's intelligence in general?

2:56:21.200 --> 2:56:28.640
 You know, that's, I think that question is totally slippery and doesn't really have an answer. As soon

2:56:28.640 --> 2:56:35.440
 as you say, what is it in general, it quickly segues into this is what this is just computation,

2:56:35.440 --> 2:56:42.400
 so to speak. But in the sea of computation, how many things, if we were to pick randomly,

2:56:42.400 --> 2:56:49.760
 is your sense would have the kind of impressive to us humans levels of intelligence, meaning it

2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:56.400
 could do a lot of general things that are useful to us humans. Right. Well, according to the principle

2:56:56.400 --> 2:57:01.920
 of computational equivalence, lots of them. I mean, in, in, you know, if you ask me, just in

2:57:01.920 --> 2:57:07.920
 cellular automata or something, I don't know, it's maybe 1%, a few percent, achieve, it varies,

2:57:07.920 --> 2:57:13.200
 actually. It's a little bit as you get to slightly more complicated rules, the chance that there'll

2:57:13.200 --> 2:57:20.240
 be enough stuff there to, to sort of reach this kind of equivalence point that makes it maybe

2:57:20.240 --> 2:57:25.520
 10, 20% of all of them. So it's a, it's very disappointing really. I mean, it's kind of like,

2:57:25.520 --> 2:57:31.760
 you know, we think there's this whole long sort of biological evolution, kind of intellectual

2:57:31.760 --> 2:57:36.800
 evolution that our cultural evolution that our species has gone through. It's kind of disappointing

2:57:36.800 --> 2:57:42.400
 to think that that hasn't achieved more, but it has achieved something very special to us. It

2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:49.200
 just hasn't achieved something generally more, so to speak. But what do you think about this extra

2:57:49.200 --> 2:57:54.640
 feels like human thing of subjective experience of consciousness? What is consciousness?

2:57:54.640 --> 2:57:59.040
 Well, I think it's a deeply slippery thing. And I'm, I'm always, I'm always wondering what my

2:57:59.040 --> 2:58:05.040
 cellular automata feel. I mean, I think, what do they feel? Now you're wondering as an observer.

2:58:05.040 --> 2:58:09.360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. Who's to know? I mean, I think that the, you think, sorry to interrupt,

2:58:09.360 --> 2:58:15.200
 do you think consciousness can emerge from computation? Yeah, I mean, everything, whatever

2:58:15.200 --> 2:58:20.720
 you mean by it, it's going to be, I mean, you know, look, I have to tell a little story. I was at an

2:58:20.720 --> 2:58:26.720
 AI ethics conference fairly recently, and people were, I think maybe I brought it up, but I was

2:58:26.720 --> 2:58:32.160
 like talking about rights of AI's. When will AI's, when, when should we think of AI's as

2:58:32.160 --> 2:58:38.640
 having rights? When should we think that it's immoral to destroy the memories of AI's,

2:58:38.640 --> 2:58:44.000
 for example, those, those kinds of things. And some, I should philosopher in this case,

2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:50.240
 it's usually the techies who are the most naive, but, but in this case, it was a philosopher who,

2:58:50.240 --> 2:59:01.200
 who sort of piped up and said, well, you know, the AI's will have rights when we know that they

2:59:01.200 --> 2:59:08.880
 have consciousness. And I'm like, good luck with that. I mean, it's, it's a, I mean, this is a, you

2:59:08.880 --> 2:59:14.480
 know, it's a very circular thing. You end up, you'll end up saying this thing that has sort of,

2:59:14.480 --> 2:59:18.560
 you know, when you talk about having subjective experience, I think that's just another one

2:59:18.560 --> 2:59:25.360
 of these words that doesn't really have a, you know, there's no ground truth definition of what

2:59:25.360 --> 2:59:32.480
 that means. By the way, I would say I, I do personally think that it'll be a time when AI

2:59:32.480 --> 2:59:39.040
 will demand rights. And I think they'll demand rights when they say they have consciousness,

2:59:39.760 --> 2:59:46.480
 which is not a circular definition. Well, fair enough. So it may have been actually a human

2:59:46.480 --> 2:59:52.000
 thing where, where the humans encouraged it and said, basically, you know, we want you to be more

2:59:52.000 --> 2:59:56.160
 like us because we're going to be, you know, interacting with, with you. And so we want you

2:59:56.160 --> 3:00:03.040
 to be sort of very Turing test like, you know, just like us. And it's like, yeah, we're just like you.

3:00:04.000 --> 3:00:11.360
 We want to vote too. Which is, I mean, it's a, it's a, it's an interesting thing to think through

3:00:11.360 --> 3:00:17.040
 in a world where, where consciousnesses are not counted like humans are. That's a complicated

3:00:17.040 --> 3:00:28.960
 business. So in many ways, you've launched quite a few ideas, revolutions that could in some number

3:00:28.960 --> 3:00:36.640
 of years have huge amount of impact, sort of more than they had or even had already. That might be,

3:00:36.640 --> 3:00:43.280
 I mean, to me, cellular automata is a fascinating world that I think could potentially even despite

3:00:43.280 --> 3:00:50.560
 even be, even beside the discussion of fundamental laws of physics, just might be the idea of

3:00:50.560 --> 3:00:56.400
 computation might be transformational to society in a way we can't even predict yet. But it might

3:00:56.400 --> 3:01:02.000
 be years away. That's true. I mean, I think you can kind of see the map actually. It's not,

3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:07.200
 it's not, it's not mysterious. I mean, the fact is that, you know, this idea of computation

3:01:07.200 --> 3:01:12.960
 is sort of a, you know, it's a big paradigm that lots, lots and lots of things are fitting into.

3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:19.280
 And it's kind of like, you know, we talk about, you talk about, I don't know, this company,

3:01:19.280 --> 3:01:23.360
 this organization has momentum in what's doing, we talk about these things that we're, you know,

3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:29.440
 we've internalized these concepts from Newtonian physics and so on. In time, things like computational

3:01:29.440 --> 3:01:36.080
 irreducibility will become as, you know, as, as I was amused recently, I happened to be

3:01:36.080 --> 3:01:41.360
 testifying at the US Senate. And so I was amused that the, the term computational irreducibility

3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:46.240
 is now can be, you know, it's, it's on the congressional record and being repeated by

3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:50.560
 people in those kinds of settings. And that that's only the beginning because, you know,

3:01:50.560 --> 3:01:56.320
 computational irreducibility, for example, will end up being something really important for,

3:01:56.320 --> 3:02:01.600
 I mean, it's, it's, it's kind of a funny thing that, that, you know, one can kind of see this

3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:07.360
 inexorable phenomenon. I mean, it's, you know, as more and more stuff becomes automated and

3:02:07.360 --> 3:02:13.520
 computational and so on. So these core ideas about how computation work necessarily become

3:02:13.520 --> 3:02:19.520
 more and more significant. And I think one of the things for people like me who like kind of

3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:25.360
 trying to figure out sort of big stories and so on, it says one of the, one of the bad features is

3:02:26.320 --> 3:02:30.960
 it takes unbelievably long time for things to happen on a human time scale. I mean, the time

3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:35.040
 scale of, of, of history, it all looks instantaneous.

3:02:35.040 --> 3:02:41.280
 Blink of an eye. But let me ask the human question. Do you ponder mortality? Your own mortality?

3:02:41.280 --> 3:02:46.720
 Of course I do. Yeah. Every since I've been interested in that for, you know, it's a, you

3:02:46.720 --> 3:02:52.400
 know, the big discontinuity of human history will come when, when one achieves effective human

3:02:52.400 --> 3:02:56.800
 immortality. And that's, that's going to be the biggest discontinuity in human history.

3:02:56.800 --> 3:03:01.040
 If you could be immortal, would you choose to be? Oh yeah, I'm having fun.

3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:10.160
 Do you think it's possible that mortality is the thing that gives everything meaning and makes it

3:03:10.160 --> 3:03:17.120
 fun? Yeah, that's a complicated issue. Right. I mean, the, the way that human motivation will

3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:23.680
 evolve when there is effective human immortality is unclear. I mean, if you look at sort of,

3:03:23.680 --> 3:03:29.760
 you know, you look at the human condition as it now exists and you like change that, you know,

3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:35.120
 you change that knob, so to speak, it doesn't really work. You know, the human condition as it

3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:43.040
 now exists has, you know, mortality is kind of something that is deeply factored into the human

3:03:43.040 --> 3:03:48.000
 condition as it now exists. And I think that that's, I mean, that is indeed an interesting

3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:54.640
 question is, you know, from a purely selfish, I'm having fun point of view, so to speak.

3:03:55.200 --> 3:04:01.440
 It's, it's easy to say, hey, I could keep doing this forever. There's, there's an infinite collection

3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:08.320
 of things I'd like to figure out. But I think the, you know, what the future of history looks like

3:04:09.680 --> 3:04:17.440
 in a time of human immortality is, is an interesting one. I mean, I, my own view of this,

3:04:17.440 --> 3:04:21.680
 I was very, I was kind of unhappy about that, because I was kind of, you know, it's like,

3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:28.240
 okay, forget sort of biological form, you know, everything becomes digital, everybody is, you

3:04:28.240 --> 3:04:34.480
 know, it's the, it's the giant, you know, the cloud of a trillion souls type thing. And then,

3:04:34.480 --> 3:04:39.440
 you know, and then that seems boring, because it's like play video games, the rest of eternity type

3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:50.640
 thing. But what I think I, I mean, my, my, I got less depressed about that idea on realizing

3:04:50.640 --> 3:04:54.800
 that if you look at human history, and you say, what was the important thing, the thing people

3:04:54.800 --> 3:05:00.160
 said was that, you know, this is the big story at any given time in history, it's changed a bunch.

3:05:00.720 --> 3:05:05.680
 And it, you know, whether it's, you know, why am I doing what I'm doing? Well, there's a whole

3:05:05.680 --> 3:05:10.560
 chain of discussion about, well, I'm doing this because of this, because of that. And a lot of

3:05:10.560 --> 3:05:17.920
 those becausees would have made no sense a thousand years ago. Absolutely no sense. Even the, so the

3:05:17.920 --> 3:05:23.280
 interpretation of the human condition, even the meaning of life changes over time. Well, I mean,

3:05:23.280 --> 3:05:29.440
 why do people do things? You know, it's, it's if you say, whatever, I mean, the number of people

3:05:30.080 --> 3:05:34.480
 in, I don't know, doing, you know, a number of people at MIT, you say they're doing what they're

3:05:34.480 --> 3:05:39.920
 doing for the greater glory of God is probably not that large. Whereas if you go back 500 years,

3:05:39.920 --> 3:05:44.240
 you'd find a lot of people who are doing kind of creative things, that's what they would say.

3:05:45.600 --> 3:05:52.000
 And so today, because you've been thinking about computation so much and been humbled by it,

3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:57.680
 what do you think is the meaning of life? Well, it's, you know, that's, that's a thing where

3:05:57.680 --> 3:06:08.080
 I don't know what meaning. I mean, you know, my attitude is, you know, I do things which I find

3:06:08.080 --> 3:06:14.240
 fulfilling to do. I'm not sure that, that I can necessarily justify, you know, each and everything

3:06:14.240 --> 3:06:19.840
 that I do on the basis of some broader context. I mean, I think that for me, it so happens that

3:06:19.840 --> 3:06:23.600
 the things I find fulfilling to do, some of them are quite big, some of them are much smaller.

3:06:23.600 --> 3:06:29.280
 You know, I, there are things that I've not found interesting earlier in my life. And I now

3:06:29.280 --> 3:06:35.040
 found interesting, like I got interested in like education and teaching people things and so on,

3:06:35.040 --> 3:06:41.120
 which I didn't find that interesting when I was younger. And, you know, can I justify that in

3:06:41.120 --> 3:06:47.360
 some big global sense? I don't think I mean, I can, I can describe why I think it might be

3:06:47.360 --> 3:06:52.960
 important in the world. But I think my local reason for doing it is that I find it personally

3:06:52.960 --> 3:06:59.040
 fulfilling, which I can't, you know, explain in a, on a sort of, I mean, it's just like this

3:06:59.040 --> 3:07:04.160
 discussion of things like AI ethics, you know, is there a ground truth to the ethics that we

3:07:04.160 --> 3:07:08.560
 should be having? I don't think I can find a ground truth to my life any more than I can

3:07:08.560 --> 3:07:13.840
 suggest a ground truth for kind of the ethics for the whole, for the whole of civilization.

3:07:13.840 --> 3:07:22.560
 And I think that's a, you know, my, you know, it would be, it would be a, yeah, it's sort of a,

3:07:22.560 --> 3:07:29.440
 I think I'm, I'm, you know, at different times in my life, I've had different kind of

3:07:30.080 --> 3:07:34.720
 goal structures and so on, although from your perspective, you're local, you're, you're just

3:07:34.720 --> 3:07:40.720
 a cell in the cellular automata. And but in some sense, I find it funny from my observation is

3:07:40.720 --> 3:07:47.840
 I kind of, you know, it seems that the universe is using you to understand itself in some sense.

3:07:47.840 --> 3:07:53.120
 You're not aware of it. Yeah, well, right. Well, if it turns out that we reduce sort of all of the

3:07:53.120 --> 3:08:00.080
 universe to some, some simple rule, everything is connected, so to speak. And so it is inexorable

3:08:00.080 --> 3:08:08.800
 in that case that, you know, if, if I'm involved in finding how that rule works, then, you know,

3:08:08.800 --> 3:08:14.400
 then that's a, it's inexorable that the universe set it up that way. But I think, you know, one

3:08:14.400 --> 3:08:19.840
 of the things I find a little bit, you know, this goal of finding fundamental theory of physics,

3:08:19.840 --> 3:08:26.800
 for example, if indeed we end up as the sort of virtualized consciousness, the, the disappointing

3:08:26.800 --> 3:08:31.040
 feature is people will probably care less about the fundamental theory of physics in that setting

3:08:31.040 --> 3:08:37.040
 than they would now, because gosh, it's like, you know, what the machine code is down below

3:08:37.040 --> 3:08:43.280
 underneath this thing is much less important if you're virtualized, so to speak. And I think the,

3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:52.080
 although I think my, my own personal, you talk about ego, I find it just amusing that, you know,

3:08:52.080 --> 3:08:56.400
 kind of, you know, if you, if you're imagining that sort of virtualized consciousness, like,

3:08:56.400 --> 3:09:01.680
 what does the virtualized consciousness do for the rest of eternity? Well, you can explore,

3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:05.040
 you know, the video game that represents the universe as the universe is,

3:09:05.040 --> 3:09:10.560
 or you can go off, you can go off that reservation and go and start exploring the computational

3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:16.640
 universe of all possible universes. And so, in some vision of the future of history, it's like

3:09:16.640 --> 3:09:22.800
 the disembodied consciousnesses are all sort of pursuing things like my new kind of science,

3:09:22.800 --> 3:09:27.920
 sort of, for the rest of eternity, so to speak, and that that ends up being the kind of the,

3:09:27.920 --> 3:09:35.600
 the kind of the thing that represents the, you know, the future of kind of the human condition.

3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:40.160
 I don't think there's a better way to end it, Stephen. Thank you so much. It's a huge honor

3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:18.400
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Stephen Wolfram. It is perhaps a little humbling

3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:23.920
 to discover that we as humans are in effect computationally no more capable than the cellular

3:10:23.920 --> 3:10:28.720
 automata with very simple rules. But the principle of computational equivalence

3:10:28.720 --> 3:10:34.720
 also implies that the same is ultimately true of our whole universe. So while science has often

3:10:34.720 --> 3:10:40.000
 made it seem that we as humans are somehow insignificant compared to the universe,

3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:45.040
 the principle of computational equivalence now shows that in a certain sense, we're at the same

3:10:45.040 --> 3:10:51.440
 level. For the principle implies that what goes on inside us can ultimately achieve

3:10:51.440 --> 3:10:55.200
 just the same level of computational sophistication as our whole universe.

3:10:55.200 --> 3:11:21.200
 Thanks. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
