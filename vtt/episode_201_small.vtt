 The following is a conversation with Konstantin Batygin, Planetary Astrophysicist at Caltech,

00:06.480 --> 00:12.400
 interested in, among other things, the search for the distant, the mysterious Planet 9,

00:12.960 --> 00:18.240
 in the outer regions of our solar system. Quick mention of our sponsors, Squarespace,

00:18.240 --> 00:24.160
 Literati, Onnit, and Ni. Check them out in the description to support the podcast.

00:24.160 --> 00:30.240
 As a side note, let me say that our little sun is orbited by not just a few planets in the

00:30.240 --> 00:36.720
 planetary region, but trillions of objects in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud that extends

00:36.720 --> 00:43.440
 over three light years out. This to me is amazing, since Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our

00:43.440 --> 00:50.800
 sun, is only 4.2 light years away, and all of it is mostly covered in darkness. When I get a chance

00:50.800 --> 00:56.320
 to go out swimming in the ocean, far from the shore, I'm sometimes overcome by the terrifying

00:56.320 --> 01:02.000
 and the exciting feeling of not knowing what's there in the deep darkness. That's how I feel

01:02.000 --> 01:07.520
 about the edge of our solar system. One day, I hope humans will travel there, or at the very

01:07.520 --> 01:14.160
 least, AI systems that carry the flame of human consciousness. This is the Lux Friedman podcast,

01:14.160 --> 01:17.440
 and here's my conversation with Konstantin Batygin.

01:17.440 --> 01:26.960
 What is Planet Nine? Planet Nine is an object that we believe lives in the solar system beyond

01:26.960 --> 01:35.040
 the orbit of Neptune. It orbits the sun with a period of about 10,000 years, and is about five

01:35.040 --> 01:41.600
 earth masses. So that's a hypothesized object. There's some evidence for this kind of object.

01:41.600 --> 01:47.840
 There's a bunch of different explanations. Can you give an overview of the planets in our solar

01:47.840 --> 01:53.520
 system? How many are there? What do we know and not know about them at a high level?

01:53.520 --> 01:59.600
 All right. That sounds like a good plan. So look, the solar system basically is comprised of two

01:59.600 --> 02:06.400
 parts, the inner and the outer solar system. The inner solar system has the planets Mercury, Venus,

02:06.400 --> 02:14.800
 Earth, and Mars. Now, Mercury is about 40% of the orbital separation of where the Earth is.

02:14.800 --> 02:25.680
 It's closer to the sun. Venus is about 70% than Mars is about 160% further away from the sun than

02:25.680 --> 02:33.680
 is the Earth. These planets that we, one of them we occupy, are pretty small. They're

02:33.680 --> 02:42.000
 to leading order, sort of heavily overgrown asteroids, if you will. This becomes evident

02:42.000 --> 02:49.040
 when you move out further in the solar system and encounter Jupiter, which is 316 earth masses,

02:49.040 --> 02:58.000
 right? 10 times the size. Saturn is another huge one, 90 earth masses at about 10 times

02:58.000 --> 03:04.720
 the separation from the sun as is the Earth. And then you have Uranus and Neptune at 20 and 30,

03:04.720 --> 03:13.360
 respectively. For a long time, that is where the kind of massive part of the solar system ended.

03:13.360 --> 03:21.920
 But what we've learned in the last 30 years is that beyond Neptune, there's this expansive field

03:21.920 --> 03:28.960
 of icy debris, a second icy asteroid belt in the solar system. A lot of people have heard

03:28.960 --> 03:36.240
 of the asteroid belt, which lives between Mars and Jupiter, right? That's a pretty common thing

03:36.240 --> 03:42.400
 that people like to imagine and draw on lunchboxes and stuff. But beyond Neptune, there's a much

03:42.400 --> 03:52.160
 more massive and much more radially expansive field of debris. Pluto, by the way, it belongs to that

03:52.320 --> 03:58.320
 second icy asteroid belt, which we call the Kuiper belt. It's just a big object within that

03:58.320 --> 04:04.960
 population of bodies. Pluto, the planet. Pluto, the dwarf planet, the former planet, you know.

04:04.960 --> 04:10.000
 Why is Pluto not a planet anymore? I mean, it's tiny. We used to...

04:10.000 --> 04:15.680
 For size matters when it comes to planets. 100%. It's actually a fascinating story.

04:15.680 --> 04:22.320
 When Pluto was discovered in 1930, the reason it was discovered in the first place is because

04:22.320 --> 04:28.880
 astronomers at the time were looking for a seven Earth mass planet somewhere beyond Neptune.

04:28.880 --> 04:34.960
 It was hypothesized that such an object exists. When they found something, they interpreted that

04:34.960 --> 04:40.880
 as a seven Earth mass planet and immediately revised its mass downwards because they couldn't

04:40.880 --> 04:47.120
 resolve the object with the telescope. It looked like just a point mass star rather than a physical

04:47.120 --> 04:54.880
 disk. They said, well, maybe it's not seven. Maybe it's one. Then over the next 40 years,

04:54.880 --> 05:01.600
 Pluto's mass kept getting revised downwards, downwards, downwards until it was realized

05:01.600 --> 05:10.960
 that it's 500 times less massive than the Earth. Pluto's surface area is almost perfectly equal

05:10.960 --> 05:15.920
 to the surface area of Russia, actually. Russia is big, but it's not a planet.

05:17.520 --> 05:23.440
 Well, actually, we can touch more on that. That's another discussion. In some sense,

05:23.440 --> 05:30.320
 earlier in the century, Pluto represented our ignorance about the edges of the solar system.

05:31.760 --> 05:37.040
 Perhaps Planet Nine is the thing that represents our ignorance about now the modern

05:37.920 --> 05:42.320
 set of ignorances about the edges of our solar system. That's a good way to put it.

05:42.320 --> 05:49.440
 By the way, just imagining this belt of debris at the edge of our solar system is incredible.

05:49.440 --> 05:55.920
 Can you talk about it a little bit? What is the Kuiper belt and what is the Oort cloud?

05:55.920 --> 06:03.280
 Yeah. Okay. Look, the simple way to think about it is that if you imagine Neptune's orbit like

06:03.280 --> 06:15.120
 a circle, maybe a factor of one and a half, 1.3 times bigger on a radius of 1.3 times bigger,

06:15.120 --> 06:21.840
 you've got a whole collection of icy objects. Most of these objects are sort of the size of

06:21.840 --> 06:34.160
 Austin, maybe a little bit smaller. If you then zoom out and explore the orbits of the most

06:34.160 --> 06:38.640
 long period, the Kuiper belt object, these are the things that have the biggest orbits

06:38.640 --> 06:46.400
 and take the longest time to go around the sun, then what you find is that beyond a critical

06:46.960 --> 06:52.560
 orbit size, beyond a critical orbit period, which is about 4,000 years, you start to see

06:52.560 --> 07:00.400
 weird structure. All the orbits sort of point into one direction. All the orbits are kind of

07:00.400 --> 07:07.680
 tilted in the same way by about 20 degrees with respect to sun. This is particularly pronounced

07:07.680 --> 07:13.840
 in orbits that are not heavily affected by Neptune. There you start to see this weird dichotomy

07:13.840 --> 07:20.960
 where there are objects which are stable, which Neptune does not mess with gravitationally,

07:20.960 --> 07:25.280
 and unstable objects. The unstable objects are basically all over the place because they're

07:25.280 --> 07:32.400
 being kicked around by Neptune. The stable orbits show this remarkable pattern of clustering.

07:32.400 --> 07:39.600
 We, back I guess five years ago, interpreted this pattern of clustering as a gravitational

07:39.600 --> 07:46.480
 one way sign, the existence of a planet in a distant planet, something that is shepherding

07:46.480 --> 07:55.280
 and confining these orbits together. Of course, you have to have some skepticism when you're

07:55.280 --> 08:00.720
 talking about these things. You have to ask the question of, okay, how statistically significant

08:00.720 --> 08:06.720
 is this clustering? There are many authors that have indeed called that into question. We have

08:06.720 --> 08:15.600
 done our own analyses. Basically, just like with all statistics where there's multiple ways to

08:16.640 --> 08:25.120
 do the exercise, you can either ask the question of, if I have a telescope that has surveyed this

08:25.120 --> 08:31.600
 part of the sky, what are the chances that I would discover this clustering? That basically tells you

08:32.480 --> 08:39.680
 that you have zero confidence. That does not give you a confident answer one way or another.

08:39.680 --> 08:46.640
 Another way to do the statistics, which is what we prefer to do, is to say we have a whole night

08:46.640 --> 08:54.960
 sky of discoveries in the Kuiper Belt. If we have some object over there, which has

08:54.960 --> 08:59.040
 right ascension and declination, which is a way to say it's there on the sky, and it has

08:59.680 --> 09:06.560
 some brightness, that means somebody looked over there and was able to discover an object

09:06.560 --> 09:12.960
 of that brightness or brighter. Through that analysis, you can construct a whole map on the sky

09:12.960 --> 09:19.040
 of where all of the surveys that have ever been done have collectively looked. If you do the

09:19.040 --> 09:27.040
 exercise this way, the false alarm probability of the clustering on which the Planet 9 hypothesis

09:27.040 --> 09:33.520
 is built is about 0.4%. Wow. Okay. So there's a million questions here. One, when you say bright

09:33.520 --> 09:38.320
 objects, why are they bright? Are we talking about actual objects within the Kuiper Belt or the stuff

09:38.320 --> 09:43.360
 we see through the Kuiper Belt? This is the actual stuff we see in the Kuiper Belt. The way you go

09:43.360 --> 09:50.400
 about discovering Kuiper Belt objects is pretty easy. I mean, it's easy in theory, hard in practice.

09:50.400 --> 09:58.000
 All you do is you take snapshots of the sky, choose that direction and take the high exposure

09:58.000 --> 10:03.120
 snapshot, then you wait a night and you do it again, and then you wait another night and you

10:03.120 --> 10:08.960
 do it again. Objects that are just random stars in the galaxy don't move on the sky,

10:08.960 --> 10:14.720
 whereas objects in the solar system will slowly move. This is no different than if you're driving

10:14.720 --> 10:20.640
 down the freeway, it looks like trees are going by you faster than the clouds. This is parallax.

10:21.280 --> 10:27.120
 That's it. It's just they're reflecting light off of the sun and it's going back and hitting this.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.960
 There's a little bit of a glimmer from the different objects that you can see

10:30.960 --> 10:35.840
 based on the reflection from the sun. So there's actual light, but it's not darkness.

10:35.840 --> 10:40.720
 That's right. These are just big icicles, basically, that are just reflecting sunlight

10:40.720 --> 10:47.120
 back at you. It's then easy to understand why it's so hard to discover them because light has to

10:47.120 --> 10:54.320
 travel to something like 40 times the distance between the earth and the sun and then get

10:54.320 --> 10:59.360
 reflected back. Was it like an hour travel? Yeah, that's right. That's something like that,

10:59.360 --> 11:07.840
 because the earth to the sun is eight minutes, I believe. Yeah, in that order of magnitude.

11:07.840 --> 11:13.520
 So that's interesting. So you have to account for all of that, and then there's this huge amount of

11:14.480 --> 11:21.200
 data pixels that are coming from the pictures, and you have to integrate all of that together

11:21.200 --> 11:27.040
 to paint a high estimate of the different objects. Can you track them? Can you be like,

11:27.040 --> 11:36.320
 that's Bob? Yes, exactly. In fact, one of them is named Joe Biden. This is not even a joke.

11:36.320 --> 11:42.880
 Okay, is there a Trump one or no? No, actually, I don't know. I haven't checked for that, but

11:44.640 --> 11:49.920
 the way it works is if you discover one, you right away get a license plate for it.

11:49.920 --> 11:58.640
 Okay, so the first four numbers is the first year that this object has appeared in the data set,

11:58.640 --> 12:06.720
 if you will. And then there's this code that follows it, which basically tells you where in

12:06.720 --> 12:13.120
 the sky it is. So one of the really interesting Kuiper Belt objects, which is very much part of

12:13.120 --> 12:20.800
 the Planet Nine story is called VP113, because Joe Biden was vice president at the time, got

12:20.800 --> 12:32.080
 nicknamed Biden. VP113, got nicknamed Biden. Beautiful. What's the fingerprint for any particular

12:32.080 --> 12:36.960
 object? Like how do you know it's the same one? Or you just kind of like, yeah, from night to night,

12:36.960 --> 12:41.680
 you take a picture, how do you know it's the same object? Yeah, so the way you know is it appears

12:41.680 --> 12:48.320
 in almost exactly the same part of the sky except for moves. And this is why actually you need at

12:48.320 --> 12:57.840
 least three nights, because oftentimes asteroids, which are much closer to the earth, will appear

12:59.280 --> 13:05.280
 to move only slightly, but then on the third night will move away. So the third night is really there

13:05.280 --> 13:14.560
 to detect acceleration. Now, the thing that I didn't really realize until I started observing

13:14.560 --> 13:20.800
 together with my partner in crime and all this, Mike Brown, is just the fact that for the first

13:20.800 --> 13:26.400
 year when you make these detections, the only thing you really know with confidence is where

13:26.400 --> 13:31.520
 it is on the night sky and how far away it is. Okay, that's it. You don't know anything about

13:31.520 --> 13:39.200
 the orbit. Because over three days, the object just moves so little, right? That whole motion on

13:39.200 --> 13:44.560
 the sky is entirely coming from motion of the earth, right? So the earth is kind of the car,

13:44.560 --> 13:51.120
 the object is the tree, and you see it move. So then to get some confident information about

13:51.120 --> 13:56.480
 what its orbit looks like, you have to come back a year later, and then measure it again.

13:56.480 --> 14:00.480
 Oh, it just needs to do three nights and come back a year later and do another three nights.

14:00.480 --> 14:04.480
 Yeah. So you get the velocity, the acceleration from the three nights, and then you have the

14:05.120 --> 14:10.480
 maybe the additional information. Because an orbit is basically described by six

14:10.480 --> 14:16.320
 parameters. So you at least need six independent points, but in reality, you need many more

14:16.320 --> 14:22.160
 observations to really pin down the orbit well. And from that, you're able to construct for that

14:22.160 --> 14:27.600
 one particular object, an orbit, and then there's, of course, like how many objects are there?

14:27.600 --> 14:36.720
 There's like fourish thousand now. But in the future, that could be like millions?

14:37.360 --> 14:42.880
 Oh, sure. Oh, sure. So in fact, these things are hard to predict, but there's a new observatory

14:42.880 --> 14:48.960
 called the Vera Rubin Observatory, which is coming online maybe next year. I mean, with COVID,

14:48.960 --> 14:54.720
 these things are a little bit more uncertain, but they've actually been making great progress

14:54.720 --> 15:03.440
 with construction. And so that telescope is just going to scan the night sky every day

15:03.440 --> 15:11.120
 automatically. And just it's such an efficient survey that it might increase the census of

15:11.120 --> 15:15.840
 the distant Kuiper Belt, the things that I'm interested in by a factor of 100. I mean, that

15:15.840 --> 15:24.560
 would be that would be really cool. And yeah, that's an incredible... I mean, they might just find

15:24.560 --> 15:30.720
 Planet 9. I mean, that's almost like literally pictures, like visually. I mean, sure. Yeah.

15:30.720 --> 15:34.720
 The first detection you make, all you know is where it is in the sky and how far away it is.

15:35.440 --> 15:40.640
 If something is, you know, 500 times away from the sun, as far away from the sun as the earth,

15:40.640 --> 15:45.760
 you know that's Planet 9. That's when the story concludes. And then you can study it.

15:45.760 --> 15:49.760
 Now you can study it. Yeah. By the way, I'm going to use that as like, I don't know,

15:49.760 --> 15:54.800
 a pickup line or a dating strategy, like see the person for three days and then don't see them

15:54.800 --> 16:00.800
 at all and then see them again in a year to determine the orbit. And over time, you figure out

16:00.800 --> 16:08.640
 if sort of from a cosmic perspective, this whole thing works out. Yeah. I have no dating

16:08.640 --> 16:15.360
 advice to give. I was going to use this as a metaphor to somehow map it onto the human

16:15.360 --> 16:20.720
 condition. Okay. You mentioned the Kuiper Belt. What's the orb cloud? If you look at the Neptune

16:20.720 --> 16:26.960
 orbit as one, then the Kuiper Belt is like 1.3 out there. Yeah. And then we get farther and

16:26.960 --> 16:32.160
 farther into the darkness. What? So, okay, you've got the main Kuiper Belt, which is about,

16:32.160 --> 16:40.560
 say, 1.3, 1.5. Then you have something called the scattered disk, which is kind of an extension

16:40.560 --> 16:48.080
 of the Kuiper Belt. It's a bunch of these long, very elliptical orbits that hug the orbit of Neptune

16:48.080 --> 16:56.880
 but come out very far. So, that, the scattered disk with the current senses, like some of the

16:56.880 --> 17:07.520
 longest orbits we know of, have a semi major axis, so half the orbit length, roughly speaking,

17:07.520 --> 17:13.680
 of about 1,000, 1,000 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Wow. Now, if you keep moving

17:13.680 --> 17:22.080
 out, okay, eventually, once you're at sort of 10,000 to 100,000, roughly, that's where the

17:22.080 --> 17:29.440
 orb cloud is. Now, the orb cloud is a distinct population of icy bodies and is distinct from

17:29.440 --> 17:37.280
 the Kuiper Belt. In fact, it's so expansive that it ends roughly halfway between us and the next

17:37.280 --> 17:45.360
 star. Its edge is just dictated by, to what extent, does the solar gravity reach? Solar

17:45.360 --> 17:53.600
 gravity reaches that far. Yeah. So, it has to, wow. Yeah. In fact, imagining this is a little bit

17:53.600 --> 18:04.720
 overwhelming. So, there's a giant, like, vast, icy rock thingy. It's like a sphere. It's like,

18:04.720 --> 18:13.760
 you know, it's almost spherical structure that encircles the Sun and all the long period comets

18:14.560 --> 18:20.320
 come from the orb cloud. They come the way that they appear. I mean, for already, I don't know,

18:20.320 --> 18:26.400
 hundreds of years, we've been detecting that occasionally, like, a comet will come in and

18:27.040 --> 18:32.560
 it seemingly comes out of nowhere. Yeah. The reason these long period comets appear,

18:32.560 --> 18:38.880
 they're on very, very long time scales, right? These orb cloud objects that are sitting, you know,

18:38.880 --> 18:44.880
 30,000 times as far away from the Sun as is the Earth actually interact with the gravity of the

18:44.880 --> 18:50.960
 galaxy that tied, effectively, the tide that the galaxy exerts upon them and their orbits

18:50.960 --> 18:58.800
 slowly change in a long gate to the point where once they, their closest approach to the Sun,

18:58.800 --> 19:05.200
 starts to reach a critical distance where ice starts to sublimate, then we discover them as

19:05.200 --> 19:11.040
 comets because then ice comes off of them. They look beautiful on the night sky, etc. But they're

19:11.040 --> 19:17.760
 all coming from, you know, really, really far away. So, are any of them coming our way from

19:18.320 --> 19:22.320
 collisions? Like, how many collisions are there? Or is there a bunch of space for them to move

19:22.320 --> 19:30.480
 around? Yeah, it's completely collisionless. Out there, the physical radii of objects are so small

19:30.480 --> 19:37.680
 compared to the distance between them, right? It's just, it is truly a collisionless environment.

19:38.240 --> 19:43.840
 I don't know. I think that probably in the age of the solar system,

19:44.960 --> 19:50.080
 there have literally been zero collisions in the word cloud. Wow. When you, like, draw a picture

19:50.080 --> 19:56.560
 of the solar system, everything's really close together. So, everything, I guess, here's spaced

19:56.560 --> 20:01.920
 far apart. Do rogue planets like flying every once in a while and join? Not rogue planets,

20:01.920 --> 20:07.440
 but rogue objects from out there. Oh, sure. Oh, sure. Yeah. Join the party? Yeah, absolutely.

20:07.440 --> 20:15.680
 We've seen a couple of them in the last three or so years, maybe four years now. One, the first one

20:15.680 --> 20:24.240
 was the one called Ua Moa Moa. It's been all over the news. The second one was Comet Borisov,

20:25.200 --> 20:33.520
 discovered by a guy named Borisov. Yeah, so the way you know they're coming from elsewhere is,

20:33.520 --> 20:40.000
 unlike solar system objects, which travel on elliptical paths around the sun, these guys travel

20:40.000 --> 20:46.320
 on hyperbolic paths. So, they come in, say hello, and then they're gone. And the fact that they

20:47.120 --> 20:56.720
 exist is totally, like, not surprising, right? The Neptune is constantly ejecting

20:56.720 --> 21:03.840
 Kuiper belt objects into interstellar space. Our solar system itself is sort of leaking icy debris

21:03.840 --> 21:10.960
 and ejecting it. So, presumably, every planetary systems around other stars do exactly the same

21:10.960 --> 21:16.560
 thing. Let me ask you about the millions of objects that are part of the Kuiper belt and

21:16.560 --> 21:22.000
 the part of the ORE cloud. Do you think some of them have primitive life? It kind of makes you sad

21:22.720 --> 21:26.160
 if there's a primitive life there and they're just kind of like lonely out there in space.

21:26.720 --> 21:31.200
 How many of them do you think have life, like bacterial life? Probably an negligible amount.

21:31.200 --> 21:36.720
 Zero, you know, like zero with like a plus on top, right? Zero plus plus. Yeah.

21:40.880 --> 21:46.320
 So, you know, if you and I took a little trip to the interstellar medium, I think we would develop

21:46.320 --> 21:53.440
 cancer and die real fast, right? It's rough. Yeah, it's a pretty hostile radiation environment.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.680
 You don't actually have to go to the interstellar medium. You just have to leave the Earth's

21:57.680 --> 22:06.320
 magnetic field too, and then you're not doing so well suddenly. So, you know, this idea of,

22:07.120 --> 22:15.600
 you know, life kind of traveling between places, it's not entirely implausible, but you really

22:15.600 --> 22:20.480
 have to twist, I think, a lot of parameters. One of the problems we have is we don't actually

22:20.480 --> 22:28.000
 know how life originates, right? So, it's kind of a second order question of survival in the

22:28.000 --> 22:34.640
 interstellar medium and how resilient it is because we think you require water,

22:35.440 --> 22:42.240
 but, and that's certainly the case for the Earth, but, you know, we really don't know for sure.

22:42.800 --> 22:48.640
 That said, I will argue that the question of like, are there aliens out there is a very

22:48.640 --> 22:56.240
 boring question because the answer is, of course, there are. I mean, like, we know that

22:57.520 --> 23:05.760
 there are planets around almost every star. Of course, there are other life forms. Life is

23:05.760 --> 23:12.000
 not some specific thing that happened on the Earth, and that's it, right? That's a statistical

23:12.000 --> 23:19.040
 impossibility. Yeah, but the difficult question is, before even the fact that we don't know how

23:19.040 --> 23:24.400
 life originates, I don't think we even know what life is, like, definitionally. Like,

23:24.400 --> 23:31.760
 formalizing a kind of picture of, in terms of the mechanism we would use to search for life out

23:31.760 --> 23:38.480
 there, or even when we're on a planet to say, is this life? Is this rock that just moved from

23:38.480 --> 23:44.240
 where it was yesterday, life, or maybe not even rock, something else? I got to tell you, I want

23:44.240 --> 23:53.760
 to know what life is, okay, and I want you to show me. I think there's a song to basically accompany

23:53.760 --> 24:00.480
 every single thing we talk about today, and probably half of them are love songs, and somehow

24:00.480 --> 24:04.800
 we'll integrate George Michael into the whole thing. Okay, so your intuition is there's life

24:04.800 --> 24:10.400
 everywhere in our universe. Do you think there's intelligent life out there?

24:10.400 --> 24:18.560
 I think it's entirely plausible. I mean, it's entirely plausible. I think there's intelligent

24:18.560 --> 24:25.840
 life on Earth. So yeah, taking that, like, say, whatever this thing we got on Earth,

24:25.840 --> 24:31.200
 whether it's dolphins or humans, say that's intelligent. Definitely dolphins. I mean,

24:31.200 --> 24:38.080
 have you seen the dolphins? Well, they do some cruel stuff to each other. So if cruelty

24:39.120 --> 24:44.240
 is a definition of intelligence, they're pretty good. And then humans are pretty good on that

24:44.240 --> 24:50.400
 regard. And then there's like, pigs are very intelligent. I got actually a chance to hang

24:50.400 --> 24:55.760
 out with pigs recently. And they're, aside from the fact they were trying to eat me,

24:55.760 --> 25:02.880
 they're very, they love food. They love food, but there's an intelligence to their eyes that was

25:02.880 --> 25:11.680
 kind of like haunts me, because I also love to eat meat. And then to meet the thing, I later ate.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.880
 And that was very intelligent, and almost charismatic with the way it was expressing

25:16.880 --> 25:26.000
 it himself, herself, itself, was quite incredible. So all that to say is, if we have intelligent life

25:26.000 --> 25:31.680
 here on Earth, if we take dolphins, pigs, humans, from the perspective of like planetary science,

25:31.680 --> 25:38.960
 how unique is Earth? Okay, so Earth is not a common outcome of the planet formation process.

25:38.960 --> 25:49.360
 It's probably a something on the order of maybe a 1% effect. And by Earth, I mean,

25:50.080 --> 25:56.960
 not just an Earth mass planet, okay? I mean, the architecture of the solar system

25:56.960 --> 26:04.240
 that allows the Earth to exist in its kind of very temperate way.

26:04.240 --> 26:10.880
 One thing to understand, and this is, this is pretty crucial, right, is that the Earth itself

26:11.680 --> 26:21.760
 formed well after the gas disk that formed the giant planets had already dissipated.

26:21.760 --> 26:28.320
 You see, stars start out with, you know, the star and then a disk of gas and dust that encircles it,

26:28.320 --> 26:38.160
 okay? From this disk of gas and dust, big planets can emerge. And we have over the last two,

26:38.160 --> 26:43.680
 three decades discovered thousands of extra solar planets as an orbit of other stars.

26:43.680 --> 26:51.040
 What we see is that many of them are, you know, have these expansive hydrogen helium atmospheres.

26:51.040 --> 26:58.080
 The fact that the Earth doesn't is deeply connected to the fact that Earth took about 100

26:58.080 --> 27:04.160
 million years to form. So we missed that, you know, train, so to speak, to get that hydrogen

27:04.160 --> 27:10.560
 helium atmosphere. That's why, actually, we can see the sky, right? That's why the sky is,

27:10.560 --> 27:15.920
 well, at least in most places, that's why the atmosphere is not completely opaque.

27:15.920 --> 27:22.080
 With that, you know, kind of thinking in mind, I would argue that we're getting the kind of

27:22.080 --> 27:28.400
 emergent pictures that the Earth is, is not, you know, everywhere, right? We, there's sort of the

27:28.400 --> 27:33.840
 sci fi view of things where we go to some other star and we just land on random planets and they're

27:33.840 --> 27:41.280
 all Earth like, that's totally not true. But the even a low probability event, even if you're

27:41.280 --> 27:49.280
 imagine that Earth is a 1 in a million or 1 in a, you know, 1 in 10 million occurrence, there are

27:49.920 --> 27:56.880
 10 to the 12 stars in the galaxy, right? So you just, you always win by, by large numbers.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.080
 That's right, by supply.

27:58.080 --> 28:03.040
 They save you. Well, do you've hypothesized that our solar system wants to possess the

28:03.520 --> 28:06.880
 population of short period planets that were destroyed?

28:06.880 --> 28:12.160
 Our solar system wants to possess the population of short period planets that were destroyed by the

28:12.160 --> 28:18.320
 evil Jupiter migrating through the solar nebula. Can you explain?

28:18.320 --> 28:23.280
 If I was to say, what was the kind of, the key outcome of searches for extra solar planets,

28:24.080 --> 28:30.800
 it is that most stars are encircled by short period planets that are, you know, a few

28:30.800 --> 28:37.920
 Earth masses, right? So a few times bigger than the Earth and have orbital periods that kind of

28:37.920 --> 28:40.240
 range from days to weeks.

28:42.000 --> 28:48.400
 Now, if you go and ask the solar system, what's in our region, right? In that region,

28:48.400 --> 28:55.440
 it's completely empty, right? It's just, it's astonishingly hollow. And I think, you know,

28:55.440 --> 29:02.960
 from the sun is not some special star that decided that it was going to form the solar system.

29:02.960 --> 29:09.040
 So I think, you know, the natural thing to assume is that the same processes of planet

29:09.040 --> 29:13.360
 formation that occurred everywhere else also occurred in the solar system.

29:14.560 --> 29:19.360
 Following this logic, it's not implausible to imagine that the solar system once possessed

29:19.360 --> 29:29.680
 a system of intramercurian, like, you know, compact system of planets. So then we asked ourselves,

29:29.680 --> 29:35.920
 would such a system survive to this day? And the answer is no. At least our calculations

29:36.640 --> 29:42.240
 suggest it's highly unlikely because of the formation of Jupiter. And Jupiter's primordial

29:42.240 --> 29:47.680
 kind of wandering through the solar system would have sent this collisional field of debris that

29:47.680 --> 29:50.880
 would have pushed that system of planets onto the sun.

29:50.880 --> 29:57.200
 So was Jupiter, this primordial wandering, what did Jupiter look like? Like, why was it wandering?

29:57.200 --> 29:59.120
 It didn't have the orbit it has today?

29:59.920 --> 30:04.720
 We're pretty certain that giant planets like Jupiter, when they form, they migrate. The reason

30:04.720 --> 30:11.520
 they migrate is, you know, on a detailed level, perhaps difficult to explain, but, you know,

30:11.520 --> 30:19.680
 it's just in a qualitative sense that they form in this fluid disk of gas and dust. So it's kind

30:19.680 --> 30:27.760
 of like, okay, if I plop down a raft somewhere in the ocean, will it stay where you plop it down?

30:27.760 --> 30:32.720
 Or will it kind of get carried around? It's not really a good analogy because it's not like

30:32.720 --> 30:39.120
 Jupiter is being advected by the currents of, you know, gas and dust. But the way it migrates is

30:39.120 --> 30:47.600
 it carves out a hole in the disk and then through by interacting with the disk gravitationally,

30:47.600 --> 30:53.280
 right? It can change its orbit. The fact that the solar system has both Jupiter and Saturn,

30:53.280 --> 31:00.080
 here complicates things a lot, right? Because you have to solve the problem of the evolution of

31:00.080 --> 31:05.360
 the gas disk, the evolution of Jupiter's orbit in the gas disk, plus evolution of Saturn's and

31:05.360 --> 31:14.080
 their mutual interaction. The common outcome of solving that problem, though, is pretty easy to

31:14.720 --> 31:21.600
 explain. Jupiter forms its orbit shrinks, and then once Saturn forms, its orbit catches up

31:21.600 --> 31:26.640
 basically to the orbit of Jupiter, and then both come out. So there's this inward outward pattern

31:26.640 --> 31:34.080
 of Jupiter's early motion that happens sort of within the last million years of the lifetime

31:34.080 --> 31:41.680
 of the solar system's primordial disk. So while this is happening, if our calculations are correct,

31:42.560 --> 31:50.800
 which I think they are, you can destroy this inner system of few earth mass planets.

31:51.680 --> 31:58.480
 And then in the aftermath of all this violence, you form the terrestrial planets.

31:58.480 --> 32:02.000
 Where would they come from in that case? So Jupiter clears out the space,

32:02.000 --> 32:07.840
 and then there's a few terrestrial planets that come in, and those come in from the

32:08.960 --> 32:13.840
 disk somewhere, like one of the larger objects. Yeah, what actually happens in these calculations

32:13.840 --> 32:22.640
 is you leave behind a rather mass depleted, like, remnant disk, only a couple earth masses.

32:22.640 --> 32:32.720
 Yeah. So then from that remnant population, annulus of material over 100 million years,

32:32.720 --> 32:37.040
 by just collisions, you grow the earth and the moon and everything else.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.320
 You said annulus?

32:38.320 --> 32:38.960
 Annulus.

32:38.960 --> 32:39.680
 Annulus.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.480
 Annulus, yeah.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.160
 That's a beautiful word, what does that mean?

32:42.160 --> 32:44.400
 Well, it's like a disk that's kind of thin.

32:44.960 --> 32:50.640
 It's like a, yeah, it's something that is, you know, a disk that's so thin it's almost

32:50.640 --> 32:52.960
 flirting with being a ring.

32:52.960 --> 32:56.160
 Like, I was going to say this reminds me of Lord of the Rings.

32:56.160 --> 32:59.520
 So like this, the word just feels like it belongs in a token level.

32:59.520 --> 32:59.520
 Yeah.

32:59.520 --> 33:05.760
 Okay. So that's incredible. And so that, in your sense, as you said, like 1%, that's a rare.

33:06.400 --> 33:15.200
 The way Jupiter and Saturn danced and cleared out and, you know, cleared out the short period

33:15.920 --> 33:20.080
 debris and then changed the gravitational landscape, that's a pretty rare thing to...

33:20.080 --> 33:24.640
 It's rare and moreover, like, you don't even have to go to our calculations.

33:24.640 --> 33:30.400
 You can just ask the night sky, how many stars have Jupiter and Saturn analogs?

33:30.960 --> 33:36.240
 And the answer is Jupiter and Saturn analogs are found around only 10% of sunlight stars.

33:36.240 --> 33:41.600
 So they are, they themselves, like you kind of have to score an A minus or better on the test to,

33:41.600 --> 33:47.920
 you know, on the planet formation test to become a solar system analog, even in that basic sense.

33:47.920 --> 33:55.600
 And moreover, you know, lower mass stars, which are very numerous in the galaxy,

33:55.600 --> 34:02.400
 so called M dwarves, think like 0% of them, well, maybe like some negligible fraction

34:02.400 --> 34:09.680
 of them have giant planets. Giant planets are a rare, you know, outcome of planet formation.

34:10.320 --> 34:14.160
 One of the really big problems that remain unanswered is why.

34:14.160 --> 34:19.840
 We don't actually understand why they're so rare. How hard is it to simulate

34:20.400 --> 34:23.840
 all of the things they've been talking about, each of the things we've been talking about,

34:23.840 --> 34:28.800
 and maybe one day, all of the things we've been talking about and beyond? Meaning,

34:29.440 --> 34:36.640
 like from the initial primordial solar system, you know, a bunch of disks with,

34:36.640 --> 34:42.480
 I don't know, billions, trillions of objects in them, like simulate that such that you eventually

34:42.480 --> 34:47.760
 get a Jupiter and a Saturn, and then eventually you get the Jupiter and the Saturn that clear

34:47.760 --> 34:52.080
 out a disk, change the gravitational landscape, then Earth pops up, like that whole thing,

34:52.080 --> 35:00.080
 and then be able to do that for every other system in the, every other star in the galaxy,

35:00.080 --> 35:03.920
 and then be able to do that for other galaxies as well.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.200
 Yeah, so maybe start from the smallest simulation, like what is actually being done today?

35:11.200 --> 35:15.520
 I mean, even the smallest simulation is probably super, super difficult. Even just like one object

35:15.520 --> 35:18.160
 in the Kuiper ball is probably super difficult to simulate.

35:18.160 --> 35:25.920
 I mean, I think it's super easy. I mean, like, it's just not that hard. But, you know, let's,

35:25.920 --> 35:32.240
 let's ask the most kind of basic problem. Okay, so the problem of having a star and

35:33.120 --> 35:37.440
 something in orbit of it, that you don't need a simulation for, like, you can just write that

35:37.440 --> 35:43.040
 down on a piece of paper. This gravity would like, yeah, I guess, I guess it's important to try to,

35:44.960 --> 35:50.400
 you know, one way to simulate objects in our solar system is to build the universe from scratch.

35:50.400 --> 35:55.200
 Okay, we'll get to building the universe from scratch in a sec. But let me just kind of go

35:55.200 --> 36:01.120
 through the hierarchy of what, you know, what we do. Two objects. Two objects, analytically

36:01.120 --> 36:06.480
 solvable, like, we can figure it out very easily. If you just, you don't even, I don't think you,

36:06.480 --> 36:11.120
 yeah, you don't need to know calculus. It helps to know calculus, but you don't necessarily need

36:11.120 --> 36:17.920
 to know calculus. Three objects that are gravitationally interacting, the solution is chaotic.

36:18.480 --> 36:25.200
 Doesn't matter how many simulations you do, you, the answer loses meaning after, after some time.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.000
 I feel like that is a metaphor for dating as well, but gone.

36:28.000 --> 36:38.880
 Now look, yeah, so, so the fact that you go from analytically solvable to unpredictable,

36:38.880 --> 36:44.560
 you know, when you were, you know, when your simulation goes from two bodies to three bodies,

36:44.560 --> 36:52.160
 should immediately tell you that the exercise of trying to engineer a calculation where you form

36:52.160 --> 36:58.800
 this whole entire solar system from scratch and hope to have some predictive answer is, is a futile

36:58.800 --> 37:05.040
 one, right? We will never succeed at such a simulation. I just to clarify, you mean like

37:05.040 --> 37:11.520
 explicitly having a clear equation that generalizes the whole process enough to be able to make a

37:11.520 --> 37:16.880
 prediction? Or do you mean actually like literally simulating the objects as a hopeless pursuit

37:16.880 --> 37:22.480
 once it increases beyond three? The simulating them is not a hopeless pursuit, but the outcome

37:22.480 --> 37:30.640
 becomes a statistical one. What's actually quite interesting is I think we have all the equations

37:32.000 --> 37:38.240
 figured out, right? Like, you know, in order to really understand this, the formation of the

37:38.240 --> 37:46.640
 solar system is suffices to know gravity and magnetohydrodynamics. I mean, like the combination of

37:46.640 --> 37:50.960
 Maxwell's equations and, you know, Navier Stokes equations for the fluids, you need to know

37:50.960 --> 37:58.400
 quantum mechanics to understand the opacities and so on. But we have those equations in hand.

37:58.960 --> 38:02.800
 It's not that we don't have that understanding. It's that putting it all together

38:02.800 --> 38:12.800
 is A, very, very difficult, and B, if you were to run the same evolution twice, changing, you know,

38:13.360 --> 38:19.120
 the initial conditions by some infinitesimal amount, some, you know, minor change in your

38:19.120 --> 38:26.000
 calculation to start with, you would get a different answer. This is one, this is part

38:26.000 --> 38:32.880
 of the reason why planetary systems are so diverse. You don't have like a, you know, very predictive

38:32.880 --> 38:39.920
 path for you start with a disk of this mass and it's around this star. Therefore, you're going

38:39.920 --> 38:46.000
 to form the solar system, right? You start with this and therefore you will form this huge outcome,

38:46.000 --> 38:50.720
 huge set of outcomes, and some percentage of it will resemble the solar system.

38:50.720 --> 38:58.480
 You mentioned quantum mechanics and we're talking about cosmic scale objects. You've talked about

38:58.480 --> 39:03.600
 that the evolution of astrophysical disks can be modeled with Schrodinger's equation.

39:03.600 --> 39:13.040
 I sure did. Why? It's like, how does quantum mechanics become relevant when you consider

39:13.040 --> 39:18.000
 the evolution of objects in the solar system? Yeah. Well, let me take a, take a step back and

39:18.000 --> 39:25.200
 just say it like, I remember being, you know, utterly confused by quantum mechanics when I

39:25.200 --> 39:31.200
 first learned it. And the Schrodinger equation, which is kind of the parent equation of, of

39:31.200 --> 39:37.520
 that whole field, you know, seems to come out of nowhere, right? The way that, the way that I was

39:37.520 --> 39:42.640
 sort of explaining, I remember asking, you know, my professor is like, but where does it come from?

39:42.640 --> 39:48.400
 He's like, well, it's just like, don't worry about it. And just like calculate the hydrogen,

39:48.400 --> 39:52.800
 you know, energy levels, right? So it's like, I could do all the problems. I just

39:52.800 --> 39:58.960
 did not have any intuition for, for where this parent, you know, super important equation came

39:58.960 --> 40:04.400
 from. Now, down the line, I was, remember, I was preparing for my own lecture and I was trying to

40:04.400 --> 40:15.120
 understand how waves travel in self gravitating disks. So, you know, again, there's a very broad

40:15.120 --> 40:20.400
 theory that's already developed, but I was looking for some simpler way to explain it really

40:20.400 --> 40:27.200
 for the purposes of teaching class. And so I thought, okay, what if I just imagine a disk as an

40:27.200 --> 40:34.640
 infinite number of concentric circles, right, that interact with, with each other gravitationally?

40:36.080 --> 40:44.480
 That's a problem in some sense that I can solve using methods from like this late 1700s, right?

40:44.480 --> 40:49.760
 I can write down Hamiltonian, well, I can write down the energy function basically of their,

40:49.760 --> 40:57.440
 their interactions. And what I found is that when you take the continuum limit,

40:57.440 --> 41:02.320
 when you go from discrete circles that are talking to each other gravitationally to a

41:02.880 --> 41:11.120
 continuum disk, suddenly this gravitational interaction among them, right? The, the governing

41:11.120 --> 41:15.680
 equation becomes the Schrodinger equation. I had to think about that for a little bit.

41:15.680 --> 41:22.480
 Did you just unify quantum mechanics and gravity? No, this is not the same thing as like, you know,

41:22.480 --> 41:29.280
 fusing relativity and quantum mechanics. But it did, it did get me thinking a little bit.

41:29.280 --> 41:37.840
 So the fact that waves in astrophysical disks behave just like wave functions of, of particles,

41:37.840 --> 41:44.080
 kind of like an interesting analogy, because for me, it's easier to imagine waves traveling through,

41:44.080 --> 41:51.840
 you know, astrophysical disks or really just sheets of paper. And the reason this is that

41:51.840 --> 41:57.040
 analogy exists is because there's actually nothing quantum about the Schrodinger equation.

41:57.040 --> 42:04.480
 The Schrodinger equation is just a wave equation. And all of the interpretation that comes from it

42:05.040 --> 42:11.120
 is quantum, but the equation itself is not a quantum being.

42:11.120 --> 42:16.080
 So you can use it to model waves. It's not turtles, it's waves all the way down. You

42:16.080 --> 42:20.640
 could pick which level you picked the wave at. And so it could be at the solar system level

42:20.640 --> 42:25.840
 that you can use it. Right. And also it actually provides a pretty neat calculational tool because

42:27.760 --> 42:32.160
 it's difficult. So we just talked about simulations, but it's difficult to simulate

42:32.160 --> 42:40.480
 the behavior of astrophysical disks on time scales that are in between a few orbits and

42:40.480 --> 42:47.280
 their entire evolution. So it's over a time scale of a few orbits. You have, you do a hydrodynamic

42:47.280 --> 42:54.320
 simulation, right? You do that. Basically, that's something that you can do on a modern computer,

42:54.320 --> 42:59.920
 on a time scale of say a week. When it comes to their evolution over their entire lifetime,

42:59.920 --> 43:04.320
 you don't hope to resolve the orbits. You just kind of hope to understand how the system behaves

43:04.320 --> 43:11.360
 overall. In between, right, to get access to that, as it turns out, it's pretty, it's pretty cute.

43:11.360 --> 43:17.280
 You can use a Schrodinger equation to get the answer rapidly. So it's a calculational tool.

43:17.280 --> 43:22.960
 That's fascinating. By the way, astrophysical disks, how, what are they, how broad is this

43:22.960 --> 43:31.920
 definition? Okay. So astrophysical disks span a huge, huge amount of ranges. They start maybe

43:31.920 --> 43:36.800
 at the smallest scale. They start with actually Kuiper Belt objects. Some Kuiper Belt objects

43:36.800 --> 43:43.440
 have rings. So that's maybe the smallest example of an astrophysical disk. We've got this little

43:43.440 --> 43:49.200
 potato shaped asteroid, you know, which is, you know, sort of the size of LA or something. And

43:49.200 --> 43:57.120
 around it is, are some rings of icy matter. That object is a small astrophysical disk. Then you

43:57.120 --> 44:02.320
 have Saturn, the rings of Saturn. You have the next set of scale. You have the solar system

44:02.320 --> 44:08.800
 itself when it was forming. You have a disk. Then you have black hole disks. You have galaxies.

44:09.440 --> 44:15.760
 Discs are super common in the universe. The reason is that stuff rotates, right? I mean,

44:15.760 --> 44:23.920
 gravity works. Yeah. So, and those rings could be the material that composes those rings could be,

44:23.920 --> 44:30.480
 it could be gas, it could be solid, it could be anything. That's right. So the disk that made

44:31.680 --> 44:36.560
 from which the planets emerged was predominantly hydrogen and helium gas. On the other hand,

44:36.560 --> 44:41.520
 the rings of Saturn are made up of, you know, icicle, ice, little like

44:42.960 --> 44:49.120
 ice cubes this big, about a centimeter across. That sounds refreshing. So that's incredible.

44:49.120 --> 44:55.760
 Hydrogen and helium gas. So in the beginning, it was just hydrogen and helium around the sun.

44:55.760 --> 45:01.760
 How does that lead to the first formations of solid objects in terms of simulation?

45:01.760 --> 45:06.480
 Okay. Here's the story. So you're like, have you ever been to the desert?

45:07.680 --> 45:12.080
 Yes. I've been to the Death Valley and actually it was terrifying just as a total tangent,

45:12.080 --> 45:17.600
 I'm distracting you. But I was driving through it and I was really surprised because it was

45:17.600 --> 45:23.200
 at first hot. And then as it was getting into the evening, there's this huge thunderstorm,

45:23.200 --> 45:28.160
 like it was raining and it got freezing cold. I was like, what the hell? It was the apocalypse.

45:28.160 --> 45:33.280
 Yes. I feel like just sit there listening to Bruce Springsteen, I remember, and just thinking,

45:33.280 --> 45:37.600
 I'm probably going to die. And I was okay with it because Bruce Springsteen was on the radio.

45:37.600 --> 45:43.920
 Look, when you've got the boss, you know, you're ready to meet the boss. Yeah. So look, I mean,

45:43.920 --> 45:50.640
 it's a good line. It's true. Yeah. By the way, to continue on this tangent,

45:50.640 --> 46:01.280
 I absolutely love the Southwest for this reason. During the pandemic, I drove from LA to New Mexico

46:01.280 --> 46:07.680
 a bunch of times. The madness of weather. Yeah. The chaos of weather, the fact that it will be

46:07.680 --> 46:13.120
 blazing hot one minute and then it's just like, we'll decide to have a little thunderstorm,

46:13.120 --> 46:17.920
 maybe we'll decide to go back momentarily to like a thousand degrees and then go back to the

46:17.920 --> 46:25.360
 thunderstorm. It's amazing. That, by the way, is chaos theory in action, right? But let's get back

46:25.360 --> 46:31.760
 to talking about the desert. So in the desert, tumbleweeds have a tendency to roll because the

46:31.760 --> 46:38.160
 wind rolls them. And if you're careful, you'll occasionally see this family of tumbleweeds where

46:38.160 --> 46:44.480
 like there's like a big one and then a bunch of little ones that kind of hide in its wake, right?

46:44.480 --> 46:49.440
 And they're all rolling together and almost look like, you know, a family of ducks crossing a street

46:49.440 --> 46:56.720
 or something. Or for example, you know, if you watch Tour de France, right, you've got a whole

46:56.720 --> 47:01.840
 bunch of cyclists and they're like cycling, you know, within 10 centimeters of each other. They're

47:01.840 --> 47:09.600
 not BFFs, right? They're not trying to ride together. They are riding together to minimize the

47:09.600 --> 47:17.280
 collective, you know, air resistance, if you will, that they experience. Turns out solids

47:17.280 --> 47:26.640
 in the protoplanetary disk do just this. There's an instability wherein solid particles, right,

47:26.640 --> 47:32.960
 things that are a centimeter across will start to hide behind one another and form these clouds.

47:33.680 --> 47:42.080
 Why? Because cumulatively, that minimizes the solid component of this aerodynamic interaction

47:42.080 --> 47:49.120
 with the gas. Now these clouds, because they're kind of a favorable energetic condition for the

47:49.120 --> 47:54.880
 dust to live in, they grow, grow, grow, grow, grow until they become so massive that they collapse

47:54.880 --> 48:00.320
 under their own weight. That's how the first building blocks of planets form. That's how the

48:00.320 --> 48:06.800
 big asteroids got there. That's incredible. So is that simulatable or is it not useful to simulate?

48:06.800 --> 48:13.600
 No, no, that's simulatable. And people do these types of calculations. It's really cool. That's

48:13.600 --> 48:19.520
 actually, that's one of the many fields of planet formation theory that is really, really active.

48:19.520 --> 48:24.080
 Right now, people are trying to understand all kinds of aspects of that process. Because of

48:24.080 --> 48:32.400
 course, I've explained it as if there's one thing that happens, turns out it's a beautifully rich

48:33.200 --> 48:39.680
 dynamic. But qualitatively, formation of the first building blocks actually follows the same

48:39.680 --> 48:48.080
 sequence as formation of stars. Stars are just clouds of gas, hydrogen helium gas that sit in

48:48.080 --> 48:57.280
 space and slowly cool. And at some point, they contract to a point where their gravity overtakes

48:57.280 --> 49:01.680
 the thermal pressure support, if you will. And they collapse under their own weight,

49:01.680 --> 49:05.280
 and you get a little baby solar system. That's amazing. So do you think one day

49:05.280 --> 49:13.360
 it'll be possible to simulate the full history that took our solar system to what it is today?

49:13.360 --> 49:21.520
 Yes, and it will be useless. So you don't think your story, many of the ideas that you have about

49:21.520 --> 49:26.640
 Jupiter clear in the space, like retelling that story in high resolution is not that important?

49:26.640 --> 49:35.680
 I actually think it's important. But at every stage, you have to design your experiments,

49:35.680 --> 49:44.560
 your numerical computer experiments so that they test some specific aspect of that evolution. I

49:44.560 --> 49:53.760
 am not a proponent of doing huge simulations because even if we forget the information theory

49:53.760 --> 50:01.440
 aspect of not being able to simulate in full detail the universe, because if you do, then

50:01.440 --> 50:08.560
 you have made an actual universe. It's not the simulation. Simulation is, in some sense,

50:08.560 --> 50:15.280
 a compression of information. So therefore, you must lose detail. But that point aside,

50:16.080 --> 50:24.080
 if we are able to simulate the entire history of the solar system in excruciating detail,

50:24.080 --> 50:31.760
 I mean, it'll be cool, but it's not going to be any different from observing it, right? Because

50:32.880 --> 50:39.280
 theoretical understanding, which is what ultimately I'm interested in, comes from taking

50:40.240 --> 50:45.360
 complex things and reducing them down to something that, you know, some mechanism

50:45.360 --> 50:51.600
 that you can actually quantify. That's the fun part of astrophysics, just kind of

50:51.600 --> 51:00.480
 simulating things in extreme detail. We'll make cool visualizations, but that doesn't get you to

51:00.480 --> 51:04.880
 any better understanding than you had before you did the simulation.

51:04.880 --> 51:11.360
 If you ask very specific questions, then you'll be able to create very highly compressed,

51:12.080 --> 51:15.760
 nice, beautiful theories about how things evolve. And then you can use those to then

51:15.760 --> 51:21.600
 generalize to other solar systems, to other stars and other galaxies and say something

51:22.160 --> 51:26.960
 generalizable about the entire universe. How difficult would it be to simulate

51:28.240 --> 51:34.000
 our solar system such that we would not know the difference? Meaning, if we are living in a

51:34.000 --> 51:40.400
 simulation, is there a nice, think of it as a video game, is there a nice compressible way of

51:40.400 --> 51:47.280
 doing that? Or just kind of like you intuited with a three body situation, is just a giant mess

51:47.280 --> 51:54.720
 that you cannot create a video game that will seem realistic without actually building your

51:54.720 --> 52:03.600
 scratch? I'm speculating, but one of the, yeah, I know you have a deep understanding of this,

52:03.600 --> 52:12.320
 but for me, I'm just going to speculate that for at least in the types of simulations that we can

52:12.320 --> 52:19.600
 do today, inevitably, you run into the problem of resolution. It doesn't matter what you're

52:19.600 --> 52:27.440
 doing, it is discrete. Now, the way you would go about asking, what we're observing, is that a

52:27.440 --> 52:40.320
 simulation or is that some real continuous thing? You zoom in and try and find the grid scale, if

52:40.320 --> 52:54.240
 you will. Yeah, I mean, it's a really interesting question and because the solar system itself

52:54.240 --> 53:01.360
 and really the double pendulum is chaotic, pendulum sitting on another pendulum

53:03.040 --> 53:10.480
 moves unpredictably once you let them go. You really don't need to inject any randomness

53:10.480 --> 53:17.120
 into a simulation for it to give you stochastic and unpredictable answers. Weather is a great

53:17.120 --> 53:24.160
 example of this. Weather has a typical weather systems have a lapen of time of a few days,

53:24.160 --> 53:31.360
 and there's a fundamental reason why the forecast always sucks two weeks in advance.

53:31.920 --> 53:39.200
 It's not that we don't know the equations that govern the atmosphere, we know them well. Their

53:39.200 --> 53:45.920
 solutions are meaningless though after a few days. The zooming in thing is very interesting. I think

53:45.920 --> 53:53.120
 about this a lot, whether there'll be a time soon where we would want to stay in video game worlds,

53:53.120 --> 54:00.000
 whether it's virtual reality or just playing video games. I think that time came in the 90s

54:00.000 --> 54:06.720
 and it's been that time. Well, it's not just came, it's accelerated. I just recently saw

54:06.720 --> 54:13.600
 that WoW and Fortnite were played 140 billion hours and those are just video games and that's

54:13.600 --> 54:18.400
 increasing very, very quickly, especially with the people coming up now and being born now and

54:18.400 --> 54:24.400
 become teenagers and so on. Let's have a thought experiment where it's just you and a video game

54:24.400 --> 54:32.880
 character inside a room. Where you remove the simulation, they need to simulate a lot of objects.

54:32.880 --> 54:39.520
 If it's just you and that character, how far do you need to simulate in terms of zooming in

54:39.520 --> 54:46.640
 for it to be very real to you, as real as reality? First of all, you mentioned zooming in,

54:46.640 --> 54:53.360
 which is fascinating because we have these tools of science that allow us to zoom in in all kinds

54:53.360 --> 55:00.560
 of ways in the world around us, but our cognitive abilities like our perception system as humans

55:00.560 --> 55:04.320
 is very limited in terms of zooming in. So we might be very easily fooled.

55:04.320 --> 55:14.320
 Some of the video games on the PS4 look pretty real to me. I think you would really have to

55:14.320 --> 55:24.160
 interrogate. I think even with what we have today, Ace Combat 7 is a great example. The way that the

55:24.160 --> 55:32.720
 clouds are rendered, it looks just like when you're flying on a real airplane, the kind of

55:32.720 --> 55:42.240
 transparency. I think that our perception is limited enough already to not be able to tell

55:42.240 --> 55:50.160
 some of the differences. There's a game called Skyroom. It's an Elder Scrolls world playing

55:50.160 --> 55:59.760
 game. I played it for quite a bit. I think I played it very different than others. There'll be

55:59.760 --> 56:04.240
 long searches of time where I would just walk around and look at nature in the game. It's

56:04.240 --> 56:10.720
 incredible. Oh, sure. It's just like the graphics is like, wow, I want to stay there. It was better.

56:10.720 --> 56:16.720
 I went hiking recently. It was as good as hiking. So look, I know what you mean. Not to go on a

56:16.720 --> 56:25.600
 huge video game tangent, but the third Witcher game was astonishingly beautiful, especially

56:25.600 --> 56:33.120
 like playing on a good hardware machine. This is pretty legit. That said,

56:33.120 --> 56:42.240
 I don't resonate with the I want to stay here. One of the things that I love to do

56:43.120 --> 56:52.160
 is to go to my boxing gym and box with the guy. There's nothing quite like that physical

56:53.280 --> 56:59.680
 experience. That's fascinating. That might be simply an artifact of the year you were born.

56:59.680 --> 57:04.880
 Maybe. Because if you're born today, it almost seems like stupid to go to a gym.

57:06.160 --> 57:10.400
 You go to a gym to box with the guy. Why not box with Mike Tyson? When you yourself,

57:11.120 --> 57:15.920
 in his prime, when you yourself are also an incredible boxer in the video game world.

57:15.920 --> 57:21.040
 For me, there's a multitude of reasons why I don't want to box with Mike Tyson.

57:21.040 --> 57:28.960
 No, I enjoy tea and I want to have an ear. No, but your skills in this meat space,

57:28.960 --> 57:34.880
 in this physical realm is very limited and takes a lot of work. You're a musician.

57:35.520 --> 57:41.200
 You're an incredible scientist. You only have so much time in the day, but in the video game

57:41.200 --> 57:46.560
 world, you can expand your capabilities and all kinds of dimensions that you can never have

57:46.560 --> 57:53.120
 possibly have time in the physical world. It doesn't make sense to be existing,

57:53.120 --> 57:58.240
 to be working your ass off in the physical world when you can just be super successful

57:59.840 --> 58:03.520
 in the video game world. But I still, you enjoy sucking at stuff?

58:04.080 --> 58:09.920
 Yeah, I really struggle to get better. I sure do. I think these days with music,

58:09.920 --> 58:18.080
 music is a great example. We just started practicing live with my band again after

58:18.080 --> 58:26.800
 not playing for a year. It was terrible. It was just a lot of the nuance, a lot of the detail

58:26.800 --> 58:35.360
 is just that detail that takes years of collective practice to develop. It's just lost, but it was

58:35.360 --> 58:42.320
 just an incredible amount of fun, way more fun than all the studio sitting around and playing

58:42.320 --> 58:50.560
 that I did throughout the entire year. There's something intangible or maybe tangible about

58:51.600 --> 58:59.040
 being in person. I sure hope you're wrong. That's not something that will get lost,

58:59.040 --> 59:06.800
 because I think there's such a large part of the human condition is to hang out. If we were doing

59:06.800 --> 59:17.760
 this interview on Zoom, I'd already be bored out of my mind. Exactly. I mean, there's something

59:17.760 --> 59:23.040
 to that. I'm almost playing devil's advocate, but at the same time, I'm sure people talk about

59:23.040 --> 59:29.360
 the same way at the beginning of the 20th century about horses, where they are much more efficient.

59:30.000 --> 59:36.480
 They're much easier to maintain than cars. It doesn't make sense to have all the ways that cars

59:36.480 --> 59:41.200
 break down. There's not enough infrastructure in terms of roads for cars. It doesn't make any

59:41.200 --> 59:47.200
 sense. Horses and nature, you could do the nature where you should be living more natural life.

59:47.200 --> 59:50.880
 Those are real. You don't want machines in your life that are going to pollute your mind

59:50.880 --> 59:55.920
 and the minds of young people, but then eventually just cars took over. In that same way, it just

59:55.920 --> 1:00:08.080
 seems... Going back to horses. You can play Red Dead Redemption. Redemption. You can ride

1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:14.640
 horses in the video game world. Let me return us back to Planet Nine. Always a good place to

1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:20.240
 come back to. Now that we did a big historical overview of our solar system, what is Planet

1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:30.320
 Nine? Planet Nine is a hypothetical object that orbits the solar system at an orbital period

1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:37.680
 of about 10,000 years. An orbit which is slightly tilted with respect to the plane of the solar

1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:46.240
 system, slightly eccentric. The object itself, we think, is five times more massive than the earth.

1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:52.720
 We have never seen Planet Nine in a telescope, but we have gravitational evidence for it.

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:58.560
 This is where all the stuff we've been talking about, this clustering ideas, maybe you can speak

1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:03.760
 to the approximate location that we suspect. Also, the question I wanted to ask is,

1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:09.040
 what are we supposed to be imagining here? Because you said there are certain objects in

1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:16.480
 the Kuiper Belt that have a direction to them that they're all flocking in some way. That's

1:01:16.480 --> 1:01:22.640
 the sense that there's some gravitational object, not changing their orbit, but confining them.

1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:29.760
 Grouping their orbits together. What would happen if Planet Nine were not there? Is these orbits

1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:36.480
 that roughly share a common orientation, they would just disperse. They would just become

1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:44.800
 as a mutally symmetric point everywhere. Planet Nine's gravity makes it such that these objects

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:50.960
 stay in a state that's basically anti aligned with respect to the orbit of Planet Nine

1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:57.680
 and sort of hang out there and kind of oscillate on timescale of about a billion years.

1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:03.920
 That's one of the lines of evidence for the existence of Planet Nine. There are others.

1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:08.160
 That's the one that's easiest to maybe visualize just because it's fun to think about orbits that

1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:16.320
 all point into the same direction. But I should emphasize that, for example, the existence of

1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:21.520
 objects, again, Kuiper Belt objects that are heavily out of the plane of the solar system,

1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:28.640
 things that are tilted by, say, 90 degrees, that's not, we don't expect that as an outcome

1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:34.720
 of planet formation. Indeed, planet formation simulations have never produced such objects

1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:40.960
 without some extrinsic gravitational force. Planet Nine, on the other hand, generates them very

1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:49.440
 readily. So that provides kind of an alternative population of small bodies in the solar system

1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:53.920
 that also get produced by Planet Nine through an independent kind of gravitational effect.

1:02:53.920 --> 1:03:03.200
 So there are basically five different things that Planet Nine does individually that are

1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:09.200
 like kind of maybe a one sigma effect where you'd say, yeah, okay, if that's all it was,

1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:16.080
 maybe it's not no reason to jump up and down. But because it's a multitude of these puzzles

1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:23.040
 that all are explained by one hypothesis, that's really the magnetism, the attraction of the

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:32.000
 Planet Nine model. So can you just clarify? So most orbit, most planets in the solar system orbit

1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:39.440
 and approximately the same, so it's flat. Yeah, it's like one degree. The difference between

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:45.440
 them is about one degree. But nevertheless, if we looked at our solar system, it would look,

1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:48.080
 and I could see every single object, it would look like a sphere.

1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:58.000
 The inner part where the planets are would look like flat. The Kuiper belt and the Asteroid belt

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:03.520
 have a larger... It gets fatter and fatter and fatter and becomes a sphere.

1:04:03.520 --> 1:04:07.520
 That's right. And if you look at the very outside, it's polluted by this

1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:15.200
 quasi spheroidal thing. Nobody's, of course, ever seen the Oort cloud. We've only seen

1:04:15.200 --> 1:04:21.920
 comments that come from the Oort cloud. So the Oort cloud, which is this population of

1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:30.480
 distant debris, its existence is also inferred. You could say alternatively, there is a big

1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:36.640
 cosmic creature that occasionally is sitting at 20,000 AU and occasionally throws an icy

1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:39.680
 rock towards the sun like that. Spaghetti monster, I think it's called.

1:04:39.680 --> 1:04:46.000
 Okay. So it's a mystery in many ways, but you can infer a bunch of things about it.

1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:51.520
 By the way, both terrifying and exciting that there's this vast darkness all around us that's

1:04:51.520 --> 1:04:58.880
 full of objects that they're just throwing. It's actually astonishing that we have only

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:07.760
 explored a small fraction of the solar system. That really kind of baffles me because,

1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:15.280
 remember, as a student studying physics, you do the problem where you put the earth around the sun,

1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:21.520
 you solve that and it's one line of math and you say, okay, well, that surely was figured out by

1:05:21.520 --> 1:05:30.160
 Newton. So all the interesting stuff is not in the solar system, but that, it's just plainly not

1:05:30.160 --> 1:05:38.160
 true. There are mysteries in the solar system that are remarkable that we are only now starting to

1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:42.960
 just kind of scratch the surface of. And some of those objects probably have some information

1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:48.960
 about the history of our solar system. Absolutely. Like a great example is small

1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:55.280
 meteorites. Small meteorites are melted. They're differentiated, meaning some of the

1:05:55.280 --> 1:06:01.440
 iron sinks to corn. You say, well, how can that be? Because they're so small that they wouldn't

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:07.920
 have melted just from the heat of their accretion. Turns out the fact that the solar nebula, the

1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:14.320
 disk that made the planets was polluted by aluminum 26 isn't itself a remarkable thing. It means

1:06:14.880 --> 1:06:21.360
 the solar system did not form an isolation. It formed in a giant cloud of thousands of other

1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:27.280
 stars that were also forming, some of which were undergoing, going through a supernova

1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:35.680
 explosion, some of, and releasing these unstable isotopes that, of which we now see kind of the

1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:43.360
 traces of. It's so cool. Do you think it's possible that life from other solar systems was injected

1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:51.760
 and that was what was the origin of life on Earth? Yeah, the panspermy idea. That's seen as a low

1:06:51.760 --> 1:06:56.720
 probability event by people who studied the origin of life, but that's because then they would be

1:06:56.720 --> 1:07:01.760
 out of a job. Well, I don't think they'd be out of the job because you just then say you have to

1:07:01.760 --> 1:07:07.280
 figure out how life started there. But then you have to go there. We can study life on Earth much

1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:12.880
 easier. We could study it in the lab much easier because we can replicate conditions that are

1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:18.960
 from an early Earth much easier from a chemistry perspective, from a biology perspective.

1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:24.400
 You can intuit a bunch of stuff. You can look at different parts of Earth. To an extent,

1:07:24.400 --> 1:07:29.440
 I mean, the early Earth was completely unlike the current Earth. There was no oxygen.

1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:41.600
 One of my colleagues at Caltech, Joe Kirschnick, is certain, something like 100% certainty that

1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:51.840
 life started on Mars and came to Earth on Martian media rights. This is not a problem that I like

1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:58.960
 to kind of think about too much, like the origin of life. It's a fascinating problem, but it's

1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:05.520
 not physics and I just don't love it. It's the same reason you don't love, I thought you're a

1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:15.680
 musician. Music is not physics either, so why are you so into it? 100% physics. In all seriousness,

1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:23.840
 though, there are a few things that I really, really enjoy. I genuinely enjoy physics. I genuinely

1:08:23.840 --> 1:08:32.160
 enjoy music. I genuinely enjoy martial arts and I genuinely enjoy my family. I should have said that

1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:38.080
 all in a reverse order or something, but I like to focus on these things and not worry too much

1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:43.440
 about everything else. You know what I mean? Yes. Just because, like you said earlier,

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:50.800
 there's a time constraint. You can't do it all. There's many mysteries all around us and they're

1:08:50.800 --> 1:08:58.160
 all beautiful in different ways. To me, that thing I love is artificial intelligence. Perhaps I love

1:08:58.160 --> 1:09:05.040
 it because eventually I'm trying to suck up to our future overlords. The question of, you said

1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:12.080
 there's a lot of kind of little pieces of evidence for this thing that's Planet 9. If we were to try

1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:20.560
 to collect more evidence or be certain, like a paper that says, like you drop it, clear, we're

1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:26.240
 done, what does that require? Does that require ascending probes out or do you think we can do

1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:31.280
 it from telescopes here on Earth? What are the different ideas for conclusive evidence for Planet

1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:37.760
 9? The moment Planet 9 gets imaged from a telescope on Earth, it's done. I mean, it's just there.

1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:42.800
 Can you clarify, because you mentioned that before, from an image, would you be able to tell?

1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:52.160
 Yes. From an image, the moment you see something, something that is reflecting sunlight back at you

1:09:52.160 --> 1:10:02.240
 and you know that it's hundreds of times as far away from the sun as the Earth, you're done.

1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:08.640
 So basically, if you have a really far away thing that's big, five times the size of Earth,

1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:16.080
 that means that is Planet 9. Could there be multiple objects like that? I guess...

1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:22.160
 In principle, yeah. I mean, there's no law of physics that doesn't allow you to have multiple

1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:25.680
 objects. There's also no evidence at present for there being multiple objects.

1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:30.960
 I wonder if it's possible, just like we're finding exoplanets where they're given the

1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:36.960
 size of the ore cloud, there's basically, it's rare and rare, but they're sprinkled, Planet 9,

1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:46.000
 10, 11, 12, some... Got 13. Yeah, it goes after that. I can just keep counting. So just something

1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:51.520
 about the dynamic system, it becomes lower and lower probability event, but they gather up,

1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:58.480
 would they become larger and larger maybe, something like that. I wonder, I wonder if

1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:05.360
 discovering Planet 9 will just be almost like a springboard, it's like, well, what's beyond that?

1:11:05.360 --> 1:11:11.360
 It's entirely plausible. The ore cloud itself probably holds about five Earth masses or seven

1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:21.120
 Earth masses of material. So it's not nothing. And it all ultimately comes down to,

1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:28.720
 at what point will the observational surveys sample enough of the solar system to

1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:36.720
 reveal interesting things? There's a great analogy here with Neptune and the story of

1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:42.880
 how Neptune was discovered. Neptune was not discovered by looking at the sky. It was discovered

1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:50.400
 by, it was discovered mathematically. So yeah, the orbit of Uranus, when Uranus was found,

1:11:50.400 --> 1:12:00.800
 this was 1781, it's the kind of tracking, both the tracking of the orbit of Uranus as well as

1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:07.440
 the reconstruction of the orbit of Uranus immediately revealed that it was not following

1:12:07.440 --> 1:12:13.200
 the orbit that it was supposed to. The predicted orbit deviated away from where it actually was.

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:22.720
 So in the mid 1800s, a French mathematician by the name of Orban Le Verrier did a

1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:31.120
 beautifully sophisticated calculation which said, if this is due to gravity of a more distant planet,

1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:38.720
 then that planet is there. And then they found it. But the point is, the understanding of where to

1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:45.920
 look for Neptune came entirely out of celestial mechanics. This case with Planet 9 is a little

1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:51.200
 bit different because what we can do, I think relatively well, is predict the orbit and mass

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:56.480
 of Planet 9. We cannot tell you where it is on its orbit. The reason is we haven't seen

1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:04.400
 the Kuiper Belt objects complete an orbit, their own orbit even once because it takes 4,000 years.

1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:12.640
 But I plan to live on as an AI being and I'll be tracking those orbits.

1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:17.040
 So it takes 4,000 or 5,000 years. I mean, it doesn't have to be AI. It could be longevity.

1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:20.800
 There's a lot of really exciting genetic engineering research. So you'll just be a

1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:27.600
 brain waiting for the orbit to complete for the basic Kuiper Belt objects.

1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:35.680
 That's right. That's kind of the worst reason to want to live a long time. Can the brain smoke

1:13:35.680 --> 1:13:39.680
 a cigarette? Can you just light one up while you're waiting?

1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:52.560
 But you're making me actually realize that the one way to explore the galaxy is by just sitting

1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:58.320
 here on Earth and waiting. So if we can just get really good at waiting, it's like a Moa Moa or

1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:02.960
 these interstellar objects that fly in, you can just wait for them to come to you. Same with

1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:06.480
 the aliens. You can wait for them to come to you. If you get really good at waiting,

1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:12.320
 then that's one way to do the exploration because eventually the thing will come to you.

1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:19.920
 Maybe the intelligent alien civilizations get much better at waiting and so they all decide

1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:25.360
 to give them theoretically to start waiting. It's just a bunch of ancient intelligent civilizations

1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:29.200
 of aliens all throughout the universe just sitting there waiting for each other.

1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:35.360
 Look, you can't just be good at waiting. You got to know how to chill. You can't just sit around

1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:42.240
 and do nothing. You got to know how to chill. I honestly think that as we progress, if the aliens

1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:49.600
 are anything like us, we enjoy loving things we do. It's very possible that we just figure out

1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:58.080
 mechanisms here on Earth to enjoy our life and we just stay here forever that exploration becomes

1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:03.600
 less and less of an interesting thing to do. So you basically, yes, wait and chill. You get

1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:10.720
 really optimally good at chilling and thereby exploring is not that interesting. So in terms

1:15:10.720 --> 1:15:15.520
 of 4,000 years, it would be nothing for scientists. We'll be chilling and just all kinds of scientific

1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:19.840
 explorations will become possible because we'll just be here on Earth.

1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:21.680
 So chill. So chill.

1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:25.600
 So chill. You have a paper out recently because you already mentioned some of these ideas,

1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:28.480
 but I'd love it if you could dig into it a little bit. Of course.

1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:33.920
 The injection of inner or cloud objects into the distant Kuiper Belt by Planet 9.

1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:40.720
 What is this idea of Planet 9 injecting objects into the Kuiper Belt?

1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:48.080
 Okay. Let me take a brief step back and say, when we do calculations of Planet 9, when we do the

1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:58.320
 simulations, as far as our simulations are concerned, sort of the Neptune, like kind of the

1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:06.240
 transneptunian solar system is entirely sourced from the inside. Namely, the Kuiper Belt gets

1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:11.760
 scattered by Neptune and then Planet 9 does things to it and aligns the orbits and so on.

1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:16.880
 Then we calculate what happens on the lifetime of the solar system. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:23.040
 During the pandemic, one of the kind of questions we asked ourselves, and this is indeed something

1:16:23.040 --> 1:16:31.760
 we, Mike and I, Mike Brown, who's a partner in crime on this, and I do regularly, is we say,

1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:40.000
 how can we, A, disprove ourselves and B, how can we improve our simulations? What's missing?

1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:46.720
 One idea that maybe should have been obvious in retrospect is that all of our simulations

1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:52.240
 treated the solar system as some isolated creature, but the solar system did not form an

1:16:52.240 --> 1:16:59.680
 isolation. It formed in this cluster of stars. During that phase of forming together with thousands

1:16:59.680 --> 1:17:07.280
 of other stars, we believe the solar system formed this almost spherical population of icy debris

1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:17.280
 that sits maybe at a few thousand times the separation between the Earth and the Sun,

1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:24.560
 maybe even a little bit closer. If Planet 9 is not there, that population is completely dormant,

1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:31.840
 and these objects just slowly orbit the Sun, nothing interesting happens to them ever.

1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:37.680
 But when we realize that if Planet 9 is there, Planet 9 can actually grab some of those objects

1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:43.440
 and gravitationally reinject them into the distant solar system. So we thought, okay,

1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:49.280
 let's look into this with numerical experiments. Do our simulations, does this process work? And if

1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:57.680
 it works, what are its consequences? So it turns out indeed, not only does Planet 9 inject

1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:06.640
 these distant inner or cloud objects into the Kuiper belt, they follow roughly the same pathway

1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:14.160
 as the objects that are being scattered out. So there's this kind of two way river of

1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:21.360
 material, some of it is coming out by Neptune scattering, some of it is moving in. And if you

1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:28.240
 work through the numbers, you kind of, at the end of the day, that it has an effect on the best fit

1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:34.800
 orbit for Planet 9 itself. So if you realize that the data set that we're observing is not entirely

1:18:34.800 --> 1:18:39.840
 composed of things that came out of the solar system, but also things that got re injected back in,

1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:44.240
 then turns out the best fit Planet 9 is slightly more eccentric. That's kind of getting into the

1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:52.880
 weeds. The point here is that the existence of Planet 9 itself provides this natural bridge

1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:58.000
 that connects an otherwise dormant population of icy debris of the solar system with things that

1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:02.160
 we're starting to directly observe. So it can flow back, so it's not just the river flowing one way,

1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:09.040
 it's maybe a smaller stream go back and backwash. You want to incorporate that into the simulations

1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:13.760
 into your understanding of those distant objects when you're trying to make sense of the various

1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:21.760
 observations and so on. Exactly. That's fascinating. I got to ask you, some people think that many

1:19:21.760 --> 1:19:28.720
 of the observations that you're describing could be described by a primordial black hole. First,

1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:33.760
 what is a primordial black hole and what do you think about this idea? Yeah. So primordial black

1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:40.240
 hole is a black hole which is made not through the usual pathway of making a black hole,

1:19:41.680 --> 1:19:50.240
 which is that you have a star, which is more massive than 1.4 or so solar masses. Basically,

1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:58.320
 when it runs out of fuel, runs out of its nuclear fusion fuel, it can't hold itself up anymore and

1:19:58.320 --> 1:20:08.160
 just the whole thing collapses on itself. You create a simple way to think about it is you

1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:18.160
 create an object with zero radius that has mass but zero radius, singularity. Now, such black

1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:23.200
 holes exist all over the place. In the galaxy, there's in fact a really big one at the center

1:20:23.200 --> 1:20:31.040
 of the galaxy. That one's always looking at you when you're not looking. It's always talking

1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:38.800
 about you. And when you turn off the lights, it wakes up. That's right. So such black holes

1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:44.160
 are all over the place. When they merge, we get to see incredible gravitational waves that they

1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:50.720
 emit, etc. One plausible scenario, however, is that when the universe was forming, basically

1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:59.920
 during the Big Bang, you created a whole spectrum of black holes, some with masses of 5 Earth masses,

1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:07.520
 some with masses of 10 Earth masses, like the entire mass spectrum size, some the mass of

1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:14.240
 asteroids. Now, on the smaller end, over the lifetime of the universe, the small ones kind of

1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:21.680
 evaporate. And they're not there anymore. At least this is what the calculations tell us. But 5

1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:29.600
 Earth masses is big enough to not have evaporated. So one idea is that Planet 9 is not a planet,

1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:37.040
 and instead it is a 5 Earth mass black hole. And that's why it's hard to find. Now,

1:21:37.040 --> 1:21:45.280
 can we right away from our calculations say that's definitely true or that's not true? Absolutely

1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:54.240
 not. In fact, our calculations tell you nothing other than the orbit and the mass. And that means

1:21:55.120 --> 1:22:01.920
 the black hole, I mean, it could be a 5 Earth mass cup. It could be a 5 Earth mass hedgehog

1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:07.440
 or a black hole, or really anything that's 5 Earth masses will do, because the gravity of a

1:22:07.440 --> 1:22:13.600
 black hole is no different than the gravity of a planet. If the Sun became a black hole tomorrow,

1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:20.960
 it would be dark, but the Earth would keep orbiting it. This notion that, oh, black holes suck

1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:26.800
 everything in, that's like a sci fi notion. It's just mass. What would be the difference between

1:22:26.800 --> 1:22:34.320
 a black hole and a planet in terms of observationally? Observationally, the difference would be that you

1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:43.520
 will never find the black hole. The truth is, I never looked into this very carefully,

1:22:43.520 --> 1:22:50.640
 but there are some constraints that you can get just statistically to say, okay, if the Sun

1:22:50.640 --> 1:22:58.000
 has a binary companion, which is a 5 Earth mass black hole, then that means such black holes would

1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:03.360
 be extremely common, and you can sort of look for lensing events, and then you say, okay,

1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:09.840
 maybe that's not so likely. But that said, I want to emphasize that there's a limit to what

1:23:09.840 --> 1:23:13.920
 our calculations can tell you. That's the orbit and the mass.

1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:21.200
 So I think there's a bunch, like Ed Whitten, I think wishes it's a black hole, because I think

1:23:21.200 --> 1:23:27.600
 one exciting thing about black holes in our solar system is that we can go there and we can maybe

1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:32.000
 study the singularity somehow, because that allows us to understand some fundamental things about

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:39.920
 physics. If it's a planet, it's a planet nine, we may not, and we go there, we may not discover

1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:46.320
 anything profoundly new. The interesting thing, perhaps you can correct me about, planet nine

1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:52.000
 is like the big picture of it, the whole big story of the Kuiper Belt and all those kinds of things.

1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:59.200
 It's not that planet nine would be somehow fundamentally different from, I don't know, Neptune

1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:05.600
 in terms of the kind of things we can learn from it. So I think that there's kind of a hope that

1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:10.400
 it's a black hole because it's an entirely new kind of object. Maybe you can correct me.

1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:18.320
 Yeah. I mean, of course here, my own biases creep in because I'm interested in planets around

1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:26.400
 other stars. And I would say, I would disagree that we wouldn't find things that would be truly

1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:34.320
 fundamentally new, because as it turns out, the galaxy is really good at making

1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:42.800
 five or three earth mass objects. The most common type of planet that we see, that we

1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:48.240
 discover orbiting around other stars is a few earth masses. In the solar system,

1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:52.160
 there's no analog for that. We go from one earth mass object, which is this one,

1:24:53.040 --> 1:24:58.480
 to skipping to Neptune and Uranus, which themselves are actually relatively poorly

1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:04.800
 understood, especially Uranus from the interior structure point of view. If planet nine is a

1:25:04.800 --> 1:25:11.760
 planet, going there will give us the closest window and to understanding what other planets look like.

1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:20.640
 And I will, I'll say this, that planets kind of in terms of their complexity on some logarithmic

1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:29.440
 scale fall somewhere between a star and an insect. And the insect is way more complicated than a star.

1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:37.360
 All kinds of physical processes and really biochemical processes that occur inside of an

1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:44.480
 insect that just make a star look like somebody is like playing with the spring or something.

1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:57.760
 So, I think it would be arguably more interesting to go to planet nine if it's a planet,

1:25:57.760 --> 1:26:04.160
 because black holes are simple. They're basically macroscopic particles.

1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:09.840
 Just like the style you mentioned, in terms of complexity. So, it's possible that planet nine

1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:15.360
 is supposed to be like homogeneous is like super, like heterogeneous is a bunch of cool

1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:20.000
 stuff going on that could give us intuition. I never thought about that, that it's just

1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:26.640
 basically earth number two in terms of size and gives us, starts giving us intuition that

1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:31.280
 could be generalizable to earth like planets elsewhere in the galaxy.

1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:36.880
 I mean, yeah, Pluto is also in the sense like, you know, Pluto is a tiny, tiny thing, right?

1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:42.320
 Just like, you would imagine it's just a tiny ball of ice like who cares. But the New Horizons

1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:49.120
 images of Pluto reveal so much remarkable structure, right? They reveal glaciers flowing,

1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:54.880
 and these are glaciers not made out of water ice, but, you know, CO ice. It turns out at those

1:26:54.880 --> 1:27:01.920
 temperatures, right, of like 40 or so Kelvin, water ice looks like metal, right? Just doesn't

1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:07.840
 flow at all. But then ice made up of carbon monoxide starts to flow. I mean, there's just

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:15.040
 like all kinds of really cool phenomena that you otherwise just wouldn't really even imagine

1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:20.080
 that occur. So, yeah, I mean, there's a reason why I like planets.

1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:28.720
 Well, let me ask you, I find, as I read the idea that Ed Whitton was thinking about this

1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:35.840
 kind of stuff, fascinating. So, he's a mathematical physicist who's very interested in string theory,

1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:44.560
 won the field's medal for his work in mathematics. So, I read that he proposed a fleet of probes

1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:49.840
 accelerated by radiation pressure that could discover a planet nine primordial black holes

1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:55.280
 location. What do you think about this idea of sending a bunch of probes out there?

1:27:55.280 --> 1:28:04.720
 Yeah, look, the way the idea is a cool one, right? You go and you say, you know, launch them

1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:11.360
 basically isotropically, you track where they go. And if I understand the idea correctly,

1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:17.040
 you basically measure the deflection and you say, okay, that must be something

1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:21.600
 there since the probe trajectories are being altered.

1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:26.000
 Also, the measurement, the basic sensory mechanism is the, it's not like you have

1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:31.600
 sensors on the probes, it's more like you're, because you're very precisely able to capture,

1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:35.120
 to measure the trajectory of the probes, you can then infer the gravitational

1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:42.560
 fields and I think, I think that's the basic idea. You know, back a few years ago, we had

1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:50.880
 conversations like these with, you know, engineers from JPL, they more or less convinced me that

1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:57.280
 this is much more difficult than it seems because you don't, at that level of precision,

1:28:57.280 --> 1:29:03.200
 right? Things like solar flares matter, right? Solar flares, right, are completely

1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:08.240
 chaotic. You can't predict which, where a solar flare will happen. That will drive

1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:12.880
 radiation pressure gradients. You don't know where every single asteroid is. So like,

1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:20.880
 actually doing that problem, I think it's possible, but it's, it's not a trivial matter, right?

1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:27.840
 Well, I wonder, not just about Planet Nine, I wonder if that's kind of the future of doing

1:29:27.840 --> 1:29:34.320
 science in our solar system is to just launch a huge number of probes. So like a whole order of

1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:40.640
 magnitude, many orders of magnitude, larger numbers of probes and then start to infer a bunch

1:29:40.640 --> 1:29:46.080
 of different stuff, not just gravity, but everything else. So in this regard, I actually

1:29:46.080 --> 1:29:52.880
 think there is a huge revolution that's to some extent already started, right? The standard kind

1:29:52.880 --> 1:29:59.200
 of like timescale for a NASA mission is that you like propose it and it launches, I don't know,

1:29:59.200 --> 1:30:05.280
 like 150 years after you propose, I'm over exaggerating, but you know, it's just like some

1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:14.960
 huge development cycle and it gets delayed 55 times. Like that is not going away, right?

1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:20.400
 The really cutting edge things, you have to do it this way because you don't know what you're

1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:29.520
 building, so to speak. But the CubeSat kind of world is starting to, you know, provide an avenue

1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:36.800
 for like launching something that costs a few million dollars and has a turnaround timescale

1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:42.960
 of like a couple of years. You can imagine doing PhD theses where you design the mission,

1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:48.240
 the mission goes to where you're going and you do the science all within a time span of five,

1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:55.920
 six years. That has not been fully executed on yet, but I absolutely think that's on the horizon

1:30:55.920 --> 1:31:01.280
 and we're not talking a decade, I think we're talking like this decade. Yeah, and the companies

1:31:01.280 --> 1:31:09.600
 are accelerating all this with Blue Origin and SpaceX. There's a bunch of more CubeSat oriented

1:31:09.600 --> 1:31:15.760
 companies that are pushing this forward. Let me ask you on that topic, what do you think about

1:31:16.800 --> 1:31:23.680
 either one? Elon Musk with SpaceX going to Mars, I think he wants SpaceX to be the first

1:31:23.680 --> 1:31:33.120
 to put a first human on Mars. And then Jeff Bezos got to give him props, wants to be the first to

1:31:33.120 --> 1:31:41.200
 fly his own rocket out into space. You know, wasn't there a guy who like built his rocket out of

1:31:41.200 --> 1:31:47.440
 garbage? Yeah. This was like a couple years ago and somewhere in the desert he launched himself.

1:31:47.440 --> 1:31:52.720
 I'm not tracking this closely, but I think I am familiar with folks who built their own rocket

1:31:52.720 --> 1:31:58.400
 to try to prove the Earth is flat. Yes, that's the guy. He was also like he also jumped some limousine.

1:32:00.400 --> 1:32:02.880
 Truly revolutionary mind. You have to

1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:13.360
 greater men than either you or I. So look, it's been astonishing to watch how really over the

1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:23.280
 last decade the commercial sector took over this industry that traditionally has really

1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:30.960
 been like a government thing to do. Motivated primarily by the competition between nations

1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:38.640
 like the Cold War. And now it's motivated more and more by the natural forces of capitalism.

1:32:38.640 --> 1:32:45.360
 Yes, that's right. So, okay, here I have many ideas about I think on the one hand, right,

1:32:45.360 --> 1:32:54.320
 like what SpaceX has been able to do, for example, phenomenal. If that brings down the price of

1:32:54.320 --> 1:33:00.240
 SpaceX within that turnaround timescale for space exploration, which I think it inevitably will,

1:33:01.600 --> 1:33:08.400
 that's a huge boost to the human condition. The same time, right, if we're talking

1:33:08.400 --> 1:33:15.600
 astronomy, there also it comes at a huge cost. And the Starlink satellites is a great example

1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:23.520
 of that cost. At one point, in fact, I was just camping in the Mojave with a friend of mine,

1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:33.040
 and they saw this string of satellites just kind of appear and then disappear into nowhere. So that

1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:39.840
 is beginning to interfere with earth based observations. So I think there's tremendous

1:33:39.840 --> 1:33:44.160
 potential there. It's also important to be responsible about how it's executed.

1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:53.520
 Now, with Mars and the whole idea of exploring Mars, I don't have like strong opinions on whether

1:33:53.520 --> 1:34:05.440
 a manned mission is required or not required. But I do think the thing to keep in mind is that

1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:13.840
 I'm not signed on, if you will, to the idea that Mars is some kind of a safe haven that we can

1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:25.600
 escape to. Mars sucks. Living on Mars, if you want to live on Mars, you can have that experience

1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:31.920
 by going to the Mojave desert and camping, and it's just not a great...

1:34:31.920 --> 1:34:35.920
 It's interesting, but there's something captivating about that kind of mission of us

1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:44.880
 striving out into space, and by making Mars in some way habitable for at least months at a time,

1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:51.760
 I think would lead to engineering breakthroughs that would make life in many ways much better

1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:57.840
 on earth. It will come up with ideas we totally don't expect yet, both on the robotic side,

1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:07.120
 on the food engineering side, maybe we'll switch from... There'll be huge breakthroughs in insect

1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:14.800
 farming as exciting as I find that idea to be. In the ways we consume protein, maybe

1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:21.840
 it'll revolutionize, we do factory farming, which is full of cruelty and torture of animals,

1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:27.760
 we'll revolutionize that completely because of our... We shouldn't need to go to Mars to

1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:32.720
 revolutionize life here on earth, but at the same time, I shouldn't need a deadline to get

1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:38.000
 shit done, but I do need it. In the same way, I think we need Mars. There's something about

1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:43.120
 the human spirit that loves that longing for exploration. I agree with that thesis. Going

1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:56.160
 to the moon and that whole endeavor has captivated the imagination of so many, and it has led to

1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:03.120
 incredible ideas, really, and probably in nonlinear ways, not like, okay, we went to the moon,

1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:10.320
 therefore, some person here has thought of this. In that similar sense, I think space exploration

1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:18.080
 is... There's some real magnetism about it, and it's on a genetic level. We have this

1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:26.240
 need to keep exploring when we're done with a certain frontier, we move on to the next frontier.

1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:33.120
 All that I'm saying is that I'm not moving to Mars to live there permanently ever, and I think

1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:43.520
 that... I'm glad you noted the degradation of the earth. I think that is a true leading order

1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:48.320
 challenge of our time. Yeah, a great engineer. That's a bunch of engineering problems. I'm

1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:54.080
 most interested in this space because as I've read extensively, it's apparently very difficult to

1:36:54.080 --> 1:36:59.760
 have sex in space, and so I just want that problem to be solved because I think once we solve the

1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:05.600
 sex in space problem, we'll revolutionize sex here on earth, thereby increasing the fun on earth,

1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:13.120
 and the consequences of that can only be good. I mean, you've got a clear plan, right, and it

1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:19.520
 sounds like... I'm submitting proposals to NASA as we speak. That's right. I keep getting rejected.

1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:26.400
 I don't know why. Okay. You need better diagrams. Better pictures. I should have thought of that.

1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:31.760
 You a while ago mentioned that there's certain aspects in the history of the solar system and

1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:39.760
 earth that resulted... It could have resulted in an opaque atmosphere, but it didn't. We can see the

1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:48.240
 stars. Somebody mentioned to me a little bit ago... It's almost like a philosophical question for you.

1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:59.280
 Do you think the human society would develop as it did or at all if we couldn't see the stars?

1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:06.960
 It would be drastically different. If it ever did develop... So I think some of the early

1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:15.440
 developments of like... Fire. First of all, that atmosphere would be so hot because if you have

1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:24.320
 an opaque atmosphere, the temperature at the bottom is huge. So we would be very different

1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:27.920
 beings to start with. We'd have very different... It could be cloudy in certain kinds of ways

1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:34.560
 that you could still get. Okay. Think about like a greenhouse, right? A greenhouse is cloudy,

1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:41.760
 effectively, but it's super hot. Yeah, it's hard to avoid having an atmosphere. If you have an

1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:48.720
 opaque atmosphere, it's hard to... Venus is a great example. Venus is... I don't remember exactly how

1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:56.240
 many degrees, but it's hundreds in Celsius. It's not 100, it's hundreds. Even though it's only a

1:38:56.240 --> 1:39:00.880
 little bit closer to the sun, that temperature is entirely coming from the fact that the atmosphere

1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:07.520
 is thick. So it's just a sauna of sorts. Yeah, you go there, you feel refreshed after you come back.

1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:13.920
 But if you stay there, I mean, so, okay, take that as an assumption. This is a philosophical

1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:18.480
 question, not a biological one. So you have a life that develops under these extremely hot

1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:26.800
 conditions. Yeah, so let's see. So much of the early evolution of mankind was driven by exploration.

1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:36.720
 Yeah. Right. And the kind of interest in stars originated in part as a tool to guide that exploration.

1:39:37.280 --> 1:39:45.200
 Right? I mean, that in itself, I think would be a huge differential in the way that we

1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:52.800
 are of our evolution on this planet. Yeah, I mean, stars, that's brilliant. So even in that aspect,

1:39:52.800 --> 1:40:00.720
 but even in further aspects, astronomy just shows up in basically every single development

1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:06.640
 in the history of science up until the 20th century, it shows up. So I wonder without that,

1:40:08.480 --> 1:40:16.960
 if we would even get calculus. Yeah, look, that's a great point. Newton in part developed calculus

1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:23.360
 because he was interested in understanding, explaining Kepler's laws, right? In general,

1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:29.760
 that whole mechanistic understanding of the night sky, right, replacing a religious understanding

1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:35.360
 where you interpret, you know, this is, you know, this whatever fire god writing his,

1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:42.000
 you know, little chariot across the sky as opposed to, you know, this is some mechanistic set of

1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:50.320
 laws that transformed humanity and arguably put us on the course that we're on today, right?

1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:57.040
 The entirety of the last 400 years and the development of kind of our technological world

1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:05.520
 that we live in today was sparked by that, right? Abandoning an effectively, you know,

1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:13.760
 a non secular view of the natural world and kind of saying, okay, this can be understood. And if it

1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:19.600
 can be understood, it can be utilized, we can create our own variants of this. Absolutely,

1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:25.440
 we would be a very, very different species without astronomy. This I think extends

1:41:26.400 --> 1:41:34.880
 beyond just astronomy, right? There are questions like why do we need to spend money on X, right?

1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:42.320
 Where X can be anything like paleontology, right? The meeting patterns of penguins.

1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:51.040
 Yeah, that's like, that's right. I think, you know, there's a tremendous under appreciation

1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:59.360
 for the usefulness of useless knowledge, right? I mean, I didn't come up with this. This was a

1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:08.240
 little book by the guy who started the Institute for Advanced Studies. But, you know, it's so true,

1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:13.840
 so much of the electronics that are on this table, right, work on Maxwell's equations. Maxwell

1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:19.600
 wasn't sitting around in the 1800s saying, you know, I hope one day, you know,

1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:28.160
 we'll make, you know, a couple of mics. So, you know, a couple, you know, a couple guys can, you

1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:35.200
 know, have this conversation, right? That wasn't at no point was that the motivation. And yet,

1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:41.760
 you know, it gave us the world that we have today. And the answer is, if you are a purely

1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:46.640
 pragmatic person, if you don't care at all about kind of the human condition, none of this,

1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:56.640
 the answer is, you can tax it, right? Like the useless things have created

1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:03.680
 way more capital than useful things. And the sad thing, I mean, first of all, it's really important

1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:10.960
 to think about and it's brilliant in the following context. And like Neil deGrasse Tyson is this

1:43:10.960 --> 1:43:18.400
 book about the role of military based funding in the development of science. And then so much of

1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:27.440
 technological breakthroughs in the 20th century had to do with humans working on different military

1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:32.480
 things. And then the outcome of that had nothing to do with military. It had some military application,

1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:36.560
 but their impact was much, much bigger than military.

1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:43.120
 The splitting of the atom is kind of a canonical example of this. We all know the tragedy that,

1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:48.560
 you know, arises from splitting of the atom. And yet, you know, so much, I mean,

1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:54.640
 the atom itself does not care for what purpose it is being split. So,

1:43:55.200 --> 1:44:00.800
 So I wonder if we took the same amount of funding as we used for war and poured it into

1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:07.280
 like totally seemingly useless things like the mating patterns of penguins, we would get the

1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:14.000
 internet anyway. I think so. I think so. And, you know, perhaps more of the internet would have

1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:21.760
 penguins, you know? So we're both joking. But in some sense, like, I wonder, it's not the

1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:28.240
 penguins, because penguins is more about sort of biology, but all useless kind of tinkering and all

1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:35.520
 kinds of, in all kinds of avenues. And also because military applications are often

1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:46.160
 burdened by the secrecy required. So it's often like so much, the openness is lacking. And if we

1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:50.320
 learned anything from the last few decades is that when there's openness in science,

1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:56.480
 that accelerates the development of science. That's right. That's true. The openness of science

1:44:56.480 --> 1:45:04.640
 truly, you know, it benefits everybody. The notion that if, you know, I share my science with you,

1:45:04.640 --> 1:45:10.480
 then you're going to catch up and like know the same thing. That is a short sighted view point,

1:45:10.480 --> 1:45:18.480
 because if you catch up and you open, you know, you discover something that puts me in a position

1:45:18.480 --> 1:45:28.800
 to do the next step, right? So I absolutely agree with all of this. I mean, the kind of question

1:45:28.800 --> 1:45:33.920
 of like military funding versus non military funding is obviously a complicated one. But

1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:43.360
 at the end of the day, I think we have to get over the notion as a society that we are going to,

1:45:43.360 --> 1:45:49.760
 you know, pay for this and then we will get that, right? That's true if you're buying like,

1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:55.440
 I don't know, toilet paper or something, right? It's just not true in the intellectual pursuit.

1:45:55.440 --> 1:46:02.800
 That's not how it works. And sometimes it'll fail, right? Like sometimes like a huge fraction of what

1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:07.600
 I do, right? I come up with an idea. I think, oh, it's great. And then I work it out. It's totally

1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:14.880
 not great, right? It fails immediately. Failure is not a sign that the initial pursuit was worthless.

1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:19.520
 So failure is just part of this kind of this whole exploration thing. And we should fund more

1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:25.120
 and more of this exploration, the variety of the exploration. I think it was Linus Pauling or somebody

1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:32.080
 from, you know, that generation of scientists, you know, a good way to have good ideas is to have

1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:39.840
 a lot of ideas. So that's, I think that's true. If you are conservative in your thinking, if you

1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:47.040
 worry about proposing something that's going to fail and oh, what if, you know, like, I, there's no

1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:52.800
 science police that's going to come and arrest you for proposing the wrong thing. And, you know,

1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:59.280
 it's also just like, why would you, why would you do science if you're afraid of, you know,

1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:05.520
 you know, taking that step? It would be so much better to propose things that are plausible,

1:47:05.520 --> 1:47:10.480
 that are interesting, and then for a fraction of them to be wrong, then to just kind of, you know,

1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:16.800
 make incremental progress all your life, right? Speaking of wild ideas, let me ask you about

1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:21.360
 the thing we mentioned previously, which is this interstellar object a more and more.

1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:26.160
 Could it be space junk from a distant alien civilization?

1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:34.720
 You can't immediately discount that by saying absolutely it cannot. Anything can be space

1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:40.800
 junk. I mean, from that point of view, can any of the Kuiper Belt objects we see be space junk?

1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:44.640
 Anything on the night sky can in principle be space junk.

1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:48.240
 And Kuiper Belt would catch interstellar objects potentially and like,

1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:51.040
 force them into an orbit if they're like small enough?

1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:55.760
 Not the Kuiper Belt itself, but you can imagine like Jupiter family comments

1:47:55.760 --> 1:48:02.720
 being captured, you know, so you can actually capture things. It's even easier to do this very

1:48:02.720 --> 1:48:07.200
 early in the solar system. Like early in the solar system's life, while it's still in a cluster of

1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:15.840
 stars, it's unavoidable that you capture debris, whether it be natural debris or unnatural debris,

1:48:15.840 --> 1:48:22.480
 or just debris of some kind from other stars. That it's like a daycare center, right? Like

1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:27.600
 everybody passes their infections on to other kids. Yeah. You know, one more,

1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:32.560
 one more. There's been a lot of discussion about it. There's been a lot of interest in this over,

1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:37.120
 is it aliens or is it not? But let's like, if you just kind of look at the facts,

1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:43.200
 like what we know about it is it's kind of like a weird shape and it also accelerated,

1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:50.560
 you know, right? Like that's the two, those are the two interesting things about it.

1:48:50.560 --> 1:49:01.600
 There are puzzles about it and perhaps the most daring resolution to this puzzle is that

1:49:02.160 --> 1:49:07.600
 it's not, you know, aliens or it's not like a rock, it's actually a piece of hydrogen ice.

1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:15.520
 So this is a friend of mine, you know, Daryl Seligman, Greg Laughlin came up with this idea

1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:23.280
 that in giant molecular clouds that are just clouds of hydrogen helium gas that live in,

1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:30.880
 live throughout the galaxy at their cores, you can condense ice to become the hydrogen,

1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:37.920
 you know, icebergs, if you will. And then that explains many of the aspects of,

1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:46.320
 in fact, I think that explains all of the more mystery how it becomes elongated because basically

1:49:46.320 --> 1:49:53.200
 the hydrogen ice sublimates and kind of like a bar of soap that, you know, slowly kind of elongates

1:49:53.200 --> 1:50:01.760
 as you, as you strip away the surface layers, how it was able to accelerate because of a jet

1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:05.600
 that is produced from, you know, the hydrogen coming off of it, but you can't see it because

1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:13.680
 it's hydrogen gas, like all of this stuff kind of falls together nicely. I'm intrigued by that

1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:21.040
 idea truly because it's like, if that's true, that's a new type of astrophysical object.

1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:27.120
 And it would be produced by what's the monster that produced it initially, that kind of object.

1:50:27.120 --> 1:50:30.960
 So this is giant molecular, molecular clouds, they're everywhere. I mean, they are,

1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:36.800
 the fact that they exist is not... Are they rogue clouds or are they part of like an

1:50:36.800 --> 1:50:41.600
 oar cloud? No, no, no, they're rogue clouds. They're just floating about. Yeah. So if you go,

1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:48.720
 like, a lot of people imagine the galaxy as being a, you know, a bunch of stars, right? And

1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:54.080
 they're just orbiting, right? But the truth is, if you fly between stars, you run into clouds.

1:50:55.040 --> 1:50:59.200
 They don't have any large object that creates orbits, they're just floating about.

1:50:59.200 --> 1:51:03.840
 Just floating? But why are they floating together? Are they just float together for time and not?

1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:10.480
 Well, so these are the, these eventually become the nurseries of stars. So as they, as they cool,

1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:17.520
 they contract and, you know, then collapse into stars or into groups of stars. But some of them,

1:51:17.520 --> 1:51:26.160
 the starless molecular clouds, according to the calculations that Daryl and Greg did, can

1:51:26.160 --> 1:51:33.040
 then, can create these like icicles of hydrogen ice. I wonder why they would be flying so fast,

1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:36.160
 because they seem to be moving pretty fast at a quick pace.

1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:36.960
 You mean, one more?

1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:38.160
 One more, yeah.

1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:43.120
 That's just because of their acceleration due to, due to the sun. If you stop, I mean, it's like,

1:51:44.560 --> 1:51:49.600
 take something really far away, let it go, and the sun is here. By the time it comes close to the

1:51:49.600 --> 1:51:56.640
 sun, right, it's moving pretty fast. So that's an attractive explanation, I think, not so much,

1:51:56.640 --> 1:52:05.040
 because it's cool, but it makes a clear prediction, right, of when Verrubin Observatory comes online

1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:11.440
 next year or so, we will discover many, many more of these objects, right? And they have,

1:52:12.800 --> 1:52:19.360
 so I like, I like theories that are falsifiable and not just testable, but falsifiable. It's

1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:26.480
 good to have a falsifiable theory where you can say, that's not true. Aliens is one that's

1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:29.920
 fundamentally difficult to say, no, that's not aliens.

1:52:29.920 --> 1:52:33.920
 Well, the interesting thing to me, if you look at one alien civilization,

1:52:35.280 --> 1:52:40.160
 and then we look at the things it produces, in terms of if we were to try to detect the alien

1:52:40.160 --> 1:52:48.960
 civilization, there is like, say there's 10 billion aliens, there would probably be

1:52:52.560 --> 1:53:00.480
 trillions of dumb drone type things produced by the aliens, and then be many, many, many

1:53:00.480 --> 1:53:06.640
 more orders of magnitude of junk. So like, if you were to look for an alien civilization,

1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:11.280
 in my mind, you would be looking for the junk. That's the more efficient thing to look for.

1:53:12.080 --> 1:53:18.080
 So I'm not saying Amua Amua has any characteristics of space junk, but it kind of opened my eyes,

1:53:18.880 --> 1:53:25.440
 to the idea that we shouldn't necessarily be looking to the queen of the ant colony. We

1:53:25.440 --> 1:53:31.760
 should be looking at, I don't know, I don't know, like the traces of alien life that doesn't

1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:36.560
 look intelligent in any way, may not even look like life. It could be just garbage. We should be

1:53:36.560 --> 1:53:47.200
 looking for garbage. Just generically. Garbage that's producible by unnatural forces. I mean,

1:53:47.200 --> 1:53:51.920
 for me, at least that was kind of interesting, because if you have a successful alien civilization

1:53:52.880 --> 1:53:57.120
 that we would be producing many more orders of magnitude of junk, and that would be easier

1:53:57.120 --> 1:54:02.080
 potentially to detect. Well, so you have to produce the junk, but you have to also launch it.

1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:09.680
 So this is the, this is where let's, let's imagine, disposal. Yeah. But let's imagine we are a

1:54:09.680 --> 1:54:15.920
 successful civilization that, you know, has made it to space. We clearly have, right? And yes,

1:54:15.920 --> 1:54:21.600
 we're in the infancy of that pursuit. But, you know, we've launched, I don't know how many satellites.

1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:28.720
 Probably if you count GPS satellites, it must be at least thousands.

1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:32.320
 It's certainly thousands. I don't know if it's over 10,000, but it's on that order.

1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:36.960
 But it's on that, like a large order of magnitude. How many of the things that we've launched

1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:40.000
 will ever leave the solar system? I think two.

1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:45.920
 Two so far. Well, maybe the Voyager, the Voyager 1, Voyager 2. I don't know if the Pioneer.

1:54:46.640 --> 1:54:50.240
 So maybe three, like. Oh, there's also a Tesla Roadster out there.

1:54:51.440 --> 1:54:55.360
 That one, it will never leave the solar system. It'll just, I think that one will

1:54:55.360 --> 1:54:59.600
 eventually collide with Mars. That can be SpaceX's first Mars.

1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:08.560
 But look, so there is an energetic cost to interstellar travel, which is really hard to

1:55:08.560 --> 1:55:14.240
 overcome. And when we think about, you know, generically, what do we look for in an alien

1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:19.680
 civilization? Oftentimes, we tend to imagine that the thing you look for is the thing that we're

1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:27.520
 doing right now, right? So I think that, you know, if I look at the future, right, and for a while,

1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:34.240
 like, okay, if aliens are out there, they must be broadcasting in radio, right? That radio,

1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:42.160
 you know, the amount that we broadcast in radio has diminished tremendously in the last 50 years.

1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:49.280
 But we're doing a lot more computation, right? What are the signs of computation? Like,

1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:54.800
 that's a good, that's an interesting question to ask, right? Where, I don't know, I think

1:55:54.800 --> 1:56:01.280
 something on the order of a few percent of the entire electrical grid last year went to mining

1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:08.960
 Bitcoin, right? Well, there could be a lot of, in the future, different consequences of the

1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:14.560
 computation, which I mean, I'm biased, but it could be robotics. It could be artificial intelligence.

1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:22.320
 So we may be looking for intelligent looking objects, like that's what I meant by probes,

1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:25.200
 like things that move in kind of artificial ways.

1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:32.800
 But the emergence of AI is not an if, right? It's happening right in front of our eyes.

1:56:33.360 --> 1:56:39.600
 And the energetic costs associated with that are becoming, you know, a tangible problem.

1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:45.440
 So I think, you know, if you imagine kind of extrapolating that into the future, right,

1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:51.760
 what are the, you know, what becomes the bottleneck, right? The bottleneck might be

1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:58.960
 powering, you know, powering the AI, broadly speaking, not one AI, but powering that entire

1:56:58.960 --> 1:57:05.760
 AI ecosystem, right? So I don't know. I think, you know, space junk is kind of,

1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:13.760
 it's an interesting idea, but it's heavily influenced by like sci fi of 1950s, where by 2020,

1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:19.440
 we're all like, flying to the moon. And so we produce a lot of space junk. I'm not

1:57:21.040 --> 1:57:27.840
 sure if that's the pathway that alien civilizations take. I've also never seen an alien civilization.

1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:35.440
 That's true. But if your theory of chill turns out to be true, and then we don't,

1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:41.360
 you know, we don't necessarily explore, we seize the exploration phase of like alien civilizations

1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:50.240
 quickly sees the exploration phase of their efforts, then perhaps they'll just be chilling

1:57:50.240 --> 1:57:56.400
 in a particular space, expanding slowly, but then using up a lot of resources and then have to

1:57:56.400 --> 1:58:02.480
 have a lot of garbage disposal that sends stuff out. And the other, you know, the other idea was

1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:10.400
 that it could be a relay that you'll almost have like these GPS like markers, these sent throughout,

1:58:10.400 --> 1:58:15.520
 which I think is kind of interesting. It's similar to this probe idea of sending

1:58:17.440 --> 1:58:20.560
 a large number of probes out to measure gravitational,

1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:28.960
 to measure basically, yeah, the gravitational field, essentially. I mean, a lot of people

1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:34.640
 at Caltech or in MIT are trying to measure gravitational fields. And there's, there's a

1:58:34.640 --> 1:58:42.160
 lot of ideas of sending stuff out there that accurately measures those gravitational fields

1:58:42.880 --> 1:58:48.160
 to have a greater understanding of the early universe. But then you might realize that

1:58:48.880 --> 1:58:53.600
 communication through gravitation through gravity is actually much more effective than

1:58:53.600 --> 1:58:59.440
 than radio waves, for example, something like that. And then you send out, I mean, okay, if you're

1:58:59.440 --> 1:59:08.160
 an alien civilization that's able to have gigantic masses, like basically, we're getting there as a

1:59:08.160 --> 1:59:15.920
 civilization. No, we're not not even close. Well, I mean, I mean, like be able to sort of

1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:20.720
 play with black holes, that kind of thing. So we're talking about a whole another different

1:59:20.720 --> 1:59:26.880
 order of magnitude of masses, then it may be very effective to send signals via gravitational waves.

1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:32.640
 I actually, my sense is that all of these things are genuinely difficult to predict.

1:59:33.680 --> 1:59:38.560
 And I don't mean like to kind of shy away. I just, I really mean, if you think, if you take

1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:47.040
 imagination of what the future looked like from 500 years ago, right, it's just,

1:59:47.040 --> 1:59:56.960
 it is so hard to conceive of the impossible. So it's almost like, it's almost limiting to try and

1:59:56.960 --> 2:00:02.960
 imagine things that are an order of magnitude, or two orders of magnitude ahead in terms of

2:00:02.960 --> 2:00:11.120
 progress, just because you mentioned cars before, if you were to ask people what they wanted in

2:00:11.120 --> 2:00:22.880
 1870, it's faster buggies. So I think the whole kind of alien conversation inevitably gets limited

2:00:22.880 --> 2:00:29.360
 by our entire kind of collective astrophysical lack of imagination.

2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:37.520
 So to push back a little bit, I find that it's really interesting to talk about these wild ideas

2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:42.960
 about the future, whether it's aliens, whether it's AI, with brilliant people like yourself,

2:00:43.840 --> 2:00:48.960
 who are focused on very particular tools of science we have today to solve very particular

2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:54.160
 like rigorous scientific questions. And it's almost like putting on this wild dreamy hat,

2:00:54.160 --> 2:00:58.640
 like some percent of the time and say, like, what are like, what would alien civilizations

2:00:58.640 --> 2:01:04.720
 look like? What would alien trash look like? Well, what would our own civilization that

2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:11.040
 sends out trillions of AI systems out there, like how 9000, but 10,000 out there, what would

2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:16.080
 that look like? And you're right, any one prediction is probably going to be horrendously

2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:21.760
 wrong, but there's something about creating these kind of wild predictions that kind of opens up.

2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:26.480
 No, there's a huge magnetism to it, right? And some of it,

2:01:26.480 --> 2:01:36.400
 you know, I mean, some of the Jules Verne novels did a phenomenal job predicting the

2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:40.960
 future, right? That actually was a great example of what you're talking about,

2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:48.880
 like allowing your imagination to run free. I mean, I just hope, I just hope there's dragons.

2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:52.560
 That's, I love dragons. Yeah, dragons are the best.

2:01:52.560 --> 2:01:58.480
 But see, the cool thing about science fiction and these kinds of conversation,

2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:04.000
 it doesn't just predict the future, I think. Some of these things will create the future.

2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:10.720
 Planting the idea. The humans are amazing, like fake it till you make it.

2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:18.880
 Humans are really good at taking an idea that seems impossible at the time. And for

2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:25.920
 any one individual human, that idea is like planting a seed that eventually materializes

2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:30.400
 itself. It's weird. It's weird how science fiction can create science fiction.

2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:32.320
 And drive some of these. It drives the science.

2:02:32.320 --> 2:02:40.880
 Yeah, I agree with you. And I think in this regard, I'm like a sucker for sci fi.

2:02:40.880 --> 2:02:49.840
 It's all I listen to now when I run. And some of it is completely implausible,

2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:58.880
 right? And it's like, I don't care. It's both entertaining and it's just like

2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:05.280
 its imagination. You know about The Black Clouds book? I think it's by Fred Hoyle.

2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:12.480
 This has great connections with a lot of the advancements that are happening in NLP right now

2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:19.920
 with transformer models and so on. But it's just Black Cloud shows up in the solar system.

2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:26.560
 And then people try to send, and then it learns to talk back at you. So anyway,

2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:30.880
 we don't have to talk at all about it, but it's just something worth checking out.

2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:36.400
 With that on the alien front with The Black Cloud, to me, and the exact on the NLP front,

2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:41.520
 and also just explainability of AI, it's fascinating. Just a very question. Stephen

2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:46.000
 Wolfram looked at this with the movie Arrival. It's like, what would be the common language

2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:51.200
 that we would discover? The reason that's really interesting to me is we have aliens here on Earth.

2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:56.240
 Japanese. Japanese is the obvious answer. Japanese. Yeah, that would be the common.

2:03:56.240 --> 2:04:02.160
 And maybe it would be music, actually. That's more likely. It wouldn't be language. It would be

2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:05.920
 art that they would communicate. But I do believe that we have,

2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:13.680
 I'm with Stephen Wolfram on this a little bit, that to me, computation, like programs we write,

2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:19.600
 that they're kind of intelligent creatures. And I feel like we haven't found the common

2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:27.120
 language to talk with them. Like our little creations that are artificial are not born

2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:33.760
 with whatever that innate thing that produces language with us. And coming up with mechanisms

2:04:33.760 --> 2:04:41.840
 for communicating with them is an effort that feels like it will produce some incredible

2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:47.520
 discoveries. You can even think of, if you think that math has discovered, mathematics in itself

2:04:47.520 --> 2:04:54.800
 is a kind of... Oh yeah, it's an innate construction of the world we live in. I think we are

2:04:57.200 --> 2:05:07.760
 part of the way there because pre 1950, computers were human beings that would carry out arithmetic.

2:05:08.800 --> 2:05:16.640
 And I think it was Ulam who worked in Los Alamos at the time, like towards the end of

2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:24.080
 the Second World War, wrote something about how in the future computers will not be

2:05:25.200 --> 2:05:32.320
 just arithmetic tool, but will be truly an interactive thing with which you could do

2:05:33.200 --> 2:05:38.640
 experiments. At the time, the notion of doing an experiment, not like in the lab with some

2:05:38.640 --> 2:05:47.600
 beakers, but an experiment on a computer designing a miracle experiment was a new one.

2:05:50.160 --> 2:06:00.080
 70% of what I do is I write code, terrible code to be clear, but I write code that creates

2:06:00.880 --> 2:06:07.600
 an experiment which is a simulation. So in that sense, I think we're beginning to interact with

2:06:07.600 --> 2:06:14.800
 the computer in a way that you're saying, not as just a fancy calculator, not as just a call

2:06:14.800 --> 2:06:25.120
 and request type of thing, but something that can generate insights that are otherwise completely

2:06:25.120 --> 2:06:31.280
 unattainable. They're unattainable by doing analytical mathematics. Yeah, and there's with

2:06:31.280 --> 2:06:38.480
 AlphaFol2, we're now starting to crack open biology, so being able to simulate at first

2:06:38.480 --> 2:06:42.480
 trivial biological systems and hopefully down the line complex biological systems,

2:06:43.040 --> 2:06:51.840
 my hope is to be able to simulate psychological, like sociological systems like humans. A large

2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:57.840
 part of my work at MIT was on autonomous vehicles, and the fascinating thing to me was about

2:06:57.840 --> 2:07:03.760
 pedestrians, human pedestrians interacting with autonomous vehicles and simulating those systems

2:07:03.760 --> 2:07:08.240
 without murdering humans will be very useful, but nevertheless is exceptionally difficult.

2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:19.760
 When is my Mustang going to drive itself? I'm not even joking. It turns out it's much more

2:07:19.760 --> 2:07:27.440
 difficult than we imagined, and I suppose that's the kind of the progress of science

2:07:27.440 --> 2:07:34.480
 is just like going to Mars. It's probably going to turn out to be way more difficult than we

2:07:34.480 --> 2:07:39.360
 imagined. Sending out probes to investigate planet nine at the edge of our solar system

2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:43.440
 might turn out to be way more difficult than we imagined, but we do it anyway, and we figured

2:07:43.440 --> 2:07:50.400
 out in the end. Mars is great. Sending humans to Mars is way more complicated than sending

2:07:50.400 --> 2:07:57.200
 humans to the moon. You'd think just naively, but if they're in space, who cares? If you go there,

2:07:57.200 --> 2:08:05.120
 why don't you go there? Life support is an extremely expensive thing.

2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:08.800
 There's a bunch of extra challenges, but I disagree with you. I would be one of the

2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:13.520
 early people to go. I used to think not. I used to think I'd be one of the first maybe million

2:08:13.520 --> 2:08:18.240
 to go once you have a little bit of a society. I think I'm upgrading myself to the first like

2:08:18.240 --> 2:08:24.960
 $10,000. That's right, front of the cabin. Not completely front, but it would be interesting

2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:35.840
 to die. I'm okay with death sucks, but I like the idea of dying on Mars. Of all the places to die,

2:08:35.840 --> 2:08:42.320
 I've got to say in this regard, I don't want to die on Mars. I don't. No, no, I would much rather

2:08:42.320 --> 2:08:51.440
 die on Earth. Death is fundamentally boring. Death is a very boring experience. I've never

2:08:51.440 --> 2:08:55.840
 died before, so I don't know from first hand experience. As far as you know. It could be a

2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:02.320
 reincarnation, all those kinds of things. You mean where would you die if you had to choose?

2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:14.240
 Oh, man. Okay. There's a question of who I'd want to die with. I'd prefer not to die alone,

2:09:15.120 --> 2:09:24.640
 but surrounded by family would be preferable, where I think northern New Mexico, and I'm not

2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:29.840
 even joking. This is not a random place. Would that be your favorite place on Earth?

2:09:29.840 --> 2:09:40.160
 Not necessarily, favorite place on Earth to reside indefinitely, but it is one of the most

2:09:40.160 --> 2:09:49.040
 beautiful places I've ever been to. There's something attractive about going.

2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:57.360
 Returning to nature in a beautiful place. Let me ask you about another aspect of your life

2:09:57.360 --> 2:10:05.200
 that is full of beauty. Music. Okay. You're a musician. The absurd question I have to ask,

2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:10.800
 what is the greatest song of all time? Objectively speaking. The greatest song of all time.

2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:16.160
 I suppose that could change moment to moment, day to day, but if you were forced to answer for

2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:20.800
 this particular moment in your life, that's something that pops to mind. This could be

2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:25.360
 both philosophically, this could be technically as a musician, like what you enjoy, maybe lyrics.

2:10:25.360 --> 2:10:32.480
 Like for me, lyrics is very important, so I would probably, my choice would be lyrics based.

2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:40.800
 I don't want to answer in terms of just technical prowess. I think technical prowess is impressive.

2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:47.280
 It's impressive what can be done. I wouldn't place that into the category of the greatest

2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:55.520
 music ever written. Some classical music that's written is undeniably beautiful, but I don't

2:10:55.520 --> 2:11:06.000
 want to consider that category of music either just because, so if I was to limit the scope of

2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:14.560
 this philosophical discussion to the kind of music that I listen to, probably What's My Age Again

2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:19.840
 by Blink One and Two, it's just, it's a solid one. It's got, you know.

2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:26.080
 Said nobody ever. That's a good song. I don't even know if you're joking.

2:11:26.080 --> 2:11:29.920
 No, no, I am joking. It's a good one, but it's, yeah, I mean.

2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:31.760
 Oh, I think the back is a close second.

2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:37.840
 What's my age again? Oh, yeah.

2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:44.960
 No, I mean, it would probably, you know, songwriting wise, I think the Beatles came pretty close to.

2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:46.560
 Would they influential to you? Absolutely.

2:11:46.560 --> 2:11:47.600
 I was like the Beatles.

2:11:47.600 --> 2:11:49.840
 Yeah. Love the Beatles. I love the Beatles.

2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:52.560
 Would it be yesterday?

2:11:53.600 --> 2:11:53.920
 Yeah.

2:11:53.920 --> 2:12:00.000
 Like, I think Strawberry Fields Forever is one of, you know what one of my favorite Beatles songs is?

2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:07.680
 It's, you know, In My Life, right? That song. It's hard to imagine how whatever a 24 year old

2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:16.480
 wrote that. It is one of the most introspective pieces of music ever. You know, I'm a huge Pink Floyd

2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:22.400
 fan. And so I think, you know, if you were to, you can sort of look at the entire dark side of the

2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:29.680
 moon album and as, you know, getting pretty close up there to the pinnacle of what, you know, can be

2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:34.720
 created. So, you know, Time's a great song. Yeah. It's a great song.

2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:41.200
 Just the entirety of just the instruments, the lyrics, the feeling created by a song,

2:12:42.080 --> 2:12:49.120
 like Pink Floyd can create feelings, the entire experience. I mean, you have that with the wall

2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:57.200
 of just transporting you into another place. Songs don't, not many songs could do that as well.

2:12:57.920 --> 2:13:00.400
 Not many artists can do that as well as Pink Floyd did.

2:13:00.400 --> 2:13:07.120
 There are a lot of bands that you can kind of say, oh yeah, like if you take Blink 182, right?

2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:14.160
 If you have no idea, like if you are listening to sort of that type of pop punk for the first time,

2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:18.480
 it's difficult to differentiate between Blink 182 and like some 41 and the

2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:25.760
 thousand of other like lesser known bands that all sounded, they all had that sparkling production

2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:35.360
 feel. They all kind of sounded the same, right? With Pink Floyd, it's hard to find another band

2:13:35.360 --> 2:13:41.440
 that you're like, well, is this one Pink Floyd? Like you know when you're listening to Pink Floyd,

2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:46.720
 when you're listening to. The uniqueness, that's fascinating. You know, in the calculation

2:13:47.440 --> 2:13:53.120
 of the greatest song in the greatest band of all time, you could probably, you could probably

2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:59.840
 actually quantify this like scientifically, is like how unique, if you play different songs,

2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:04.160
 how well are people able to recognize whether it's this band or not? And that, you know,

2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:09.520
 that's probably a huge component to greatness. Like if the world would miss it if it was gone.

2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:17.040
 Yes, yes. But there's also the human story, things like I would say Output Johnny Cash's

2:14:17.040 --> 2:14:23.680
 cover of Hurt is one of the greatest songs of all time. And that has less to do with the song.

2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:25.920
 But your interaction with it?

2:14:25.920 --> 2:14:30.880
 The interaction with it, but also the human, the full story of the human. So like it's not just

2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:37.520
 if I just heard the song and be like, okay, that, but if it's the full story of it, also the video

2:14:37.520 --> 2:14:43.920
 component for that particular song. So like that, you can't discount the full experience of it.

2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:49.040
 Absolutely. You know, I have no confusion about not about being, you know, anywhere,

2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:56.800
 you know, in that link. But I just like, I sometimes think about, you know, music that is

2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:06.000
 being produced today feels oftentimes feels like, like kind of clothes, like clothes that you buy

2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:14.400
 at like H&M and you wear it three times before they rip and you throw away. So like, so much of it

2:15:14.400 --> 2:15:20.880
 is, it's not bad. It's just kind of forgettable, right? Like the fact that we're talking about Pink

2:15:20.880 --> 2:15:27.920
 Floyd in 2021 is in itself an interesting question. Why are we talking about Pink Floyd?

2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:33.200
 And it's, there's something unforgettable about them and unforgettable about the art that they

2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:38.480
 created. That could be the markets that like, so Spotify has created this kind of market where

2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:46.240
 the incentives for creating music that last is much lower because there's so much more music.

2:15:46.240 --> 2:15:51.120
 You just want something that shines bright for a short amount of time, makes a lot of money and

2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:54.880
 moves on. And I mean, the same thing you see with the news and all those kinds of things. We're

2:15:54.880 --> 2:16:01.600
 just living in a shorter and shorter, shorter like time scale in terms of our attention spans.

2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:07.360
 And that nevertheless, when we look at the long arc of history of music, perhaps there will be

2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:13.120
 some songs from today that will last as much as Pink Floyd. We're just unable to see it.

2:16:13.120 --> 2:16:18.880
 Yeah. Just the collected works of Nickelback. Exactly. You never know. You never know. Justin

2:16:18.880 --> 2:16:23.360
 Bieber, it could be a contender. I've recently started listening to Justin Bieber just to

2:16:23.360 --> 2:16:27.840
 understand what people are talking about. And I'll just keep my comments to myself on that one.

2:16:27.840 --> 2:16:34.640
 It's too good to explain. The words cannot capture the greatness that is the Bebes.

2:16:35.520 --> 2:16:45.040
 You as a musician, so you write your music, you play guitar, you sing. Maybe can you give

2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:51.120
 an overview of the role music has played in your life? You're one of the, you're a world class

2:16:51.120 --> 2:17:00.720
 scientist. And so it's kind of fascinating to see somebody in your position who is also a great

2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:07.120
 musician and still loves playing music. Yeah. Well, I wouldn't call myself a great musician.

2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:14.640
 One of the best of all time. That's right. We were saying offline confidence is like the most

2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:21.520
 essential thing about being a rock star. Exactly. The confidence and kind of like moodiness, right?

2:17:21.520 --> 2:17:30.960
 Yeah. Look, I mean, music plays an absolutely essential role in everything I do because I lose,

2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:38.640
 if I stop playing for one reason or another, say I'm traveling, I notably lose creativity in

2:17:38.640 --> 2:17:47.360
 every other aspect of my life, right? There's something, I don't view playing music as a

2:17:47.360 --> 2:17:53.760
 separate endeavor from doing science or doing whatever. It's all part of that same creative

2:17:53.760 --> 2:18:03.520
 thing, which is distinct from, I don't know, pressing a button or like. So it's not a break

2:18:03.520 --> 2:18:08.800
 from science. It's a part of your science. It's absolutely, it's a part of, I would say,

2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:16.800
 it's a thing that enables the science, right? The science would suck even more than it does

2:18:16.800 --> 2:18:22.320
 already without the music. And that means like the creating of the writing of the music or is it

2:18:22.320 --> 2:18:27.600
 just even playing other people's stuff? Is it the whole of it? Yeah. It's definitely both.

2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:38.320
 Yeah. And also just, I love to play guitar. I love to sing. My wife tolerates my

2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:46.560
 screeching singing and even kind of likes it. Yeah. So people should check out your stuff.

2:18:46.560 --> 2:18:52.080
 You have a great voice. So I love your stuff. Is there something you're super busy?

2:18:52.080 --> 2:19:00.080
 Is there something you can say about practicing for musicians, for guitar, for you're also in a

2:19:00.080 --> 2:19:05.680
 band? So like that whole, how you can manage that? Is there some tricks or some hacks to

2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:12.400
 being a lifelong musician while being like super busy? So I would say, you know,

2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:21.520
 the way that I optimize my life is I try to do the thing that I'm passionate about

2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:27.760
 in a moment and put that at the top of the priority list. There are moments when, you know,

2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:31.600
 you just, you feel inspired to play music. And if you're in the middle of something,

2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:36.640
 if you can avoid, if that can be put on hold, just do it, right? There are times when you

2:19:36.640 --> 2:19:45.040
 get inspired about something scientific, you know, I do my best to drop everything, go into that,

2:19:45.040 --> 2:19:53.440
 you know, mode of, or that isolated mode and execute upon that. So it's a chaotic, you know,

2:19:53.440 --> 2:19:59.040
 I think I have a pretty chaotic lifestyle where I'm always doing kind of multiple things and

2:19:59.040 --> 2:20:10.560
 jumping between what I'm doing. But at the end of the day, it's not like, you know, those moments

2:20:10.560 --> 2:20:18.640
 of inspiration are actually kind of rare, right? Like most of the time, all of us are just doing

2:20:18.640 --> 2:20:26.320
 kind of doing the stuff that needs to get done. If you do the disservice to yourself of saying,

2:20:26.320 --> 2:20:32.720
 oh, I'm inspired to, you know, do this calculation, figure this out. But I've got to answer email

2:20:32.720 --> 2:20:40.240
 or just like do something, something silly. You know, that is a, that is nothing more than the

2:20:40.240 --> 2:20:48.080
 service. And also, like I have some social media presence, but I mostly stay off of, you know,

2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:55.440
 social media to, you know, just frankly, because like, I don't kind of, I don't enjoy the mental

2:20:55.440 --> 2:21:03.760
 cycles that it. Yeah, it robs you of that. Yeah, those, those precious moments that could be filled

2:21:03.760 --> 2:21:10.400
 with inspiration in your, in your other pursuits. But there's something to maybe you and I are

2:21:10.400 --> 2:21:17.520
 different in this, like I tried to play at least 10 minutes of guitar every day, almost on the

2:21:17.520 --> 2:21:28.640
 technical side, like keeping that base of basic competence going. And I mean, the same way like

2:21:28.640 --> 2:21:34.320
 writers will get in front of a paper, no matter what, that kind of thing. It just feels like that

2:21:35.040 --> 2:21:42.000
 for my life has been essential to the daily ritual of it. Otherwise, days turn into weeks,

2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:48.160
 weeks turn into months and you haven't played guitar for months. No, no, I understand. For me,

2:21:48.160 --> 2:21:53.840
 I think it's, it's been like, if we have a gig coming up, we'll definitely. You need deadlines.

2:21:53.840 --> 2:22:01.200
 Yeah, that's right. No, like we will, we will sharpen up definitely, you know, especially

2:22:02.080 --> 2:22:07.200
 coming up to a gig. And it's like, you know, we're not trying to make money with this. This is like

2:22:07.200 --> 2:22:13.360
 just for the, for that satisfaction of doing something and doing something well, right?

2:22:15.040 --> 2:22:23.840
 But overall, I would say most, I play guitar most days, most days. And, you know, when I

2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:31.680
 put kids to sleep, I play guitar, you know, with them and we like, just make up random songs about,

2:22:31.680 --> 2:22:38.160
 you know, about our cat or something, you know, like we just do kind of random stuff.

2:22:38.720 --> 2:22:41.440
 But, you know, music is always involved in that process.

2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:44.320
 Keeping it fun. You have Russian roots?

2:22:44.320 --> 2:22:45.360
 I sure do.

2:22:45.360 --> 2:22:46.400
 Were you born in Russia?

2:22:46.400 --> 2:22:47.120
 I was.

2:22:47.120 --> 2:22:47.680
 Yeah.

2:22:47.680 --> 2:22:48.560
 When did you come here?

2:22:49.120 --> 2:22:59.520
 So, I came to the US in very, the very end of 99, but so I was like almost 14 years old.

2:22:59.520 --> 2:23:07.760
 But along the way, we spent six years in Japan. So, like we moved from Russia to Japan in 94.

2:23:07.760 --> 2:23:12.000
 And then to the US in 99. So, like elementary school.

2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:12.640
 Oh, interesting.

2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:13.520
 School in Japan.

2:23:13.520 --> 2:23:16.160
 So, elementary school in Japan.

2:23:16.160 --> 2:23:16.400
 Yeah.

2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:20.560
 So, that's interesting. Do you still speak Russian?

2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:21.360
 Sure.

2:23:21.360 --> 2:23:21.680
 Okay.

2:23:21.680 --> 2:23:31.440
 Okay. Maybe I'll, let me ask you in Russian, what do you remember about Russia?

2:23:31.440 --> 2:23:33.440
 It'd be interesting to hear you speak Russian.

2:23:33.440 --> 2:23:58.000
 Well, in general, I remember, I mean, I was eight when we left. And, of course, I remember everything in the first year, including the transition from 1991 to 1992, this turbulent period, and, of course, 1993.

2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:18.560
 I mean, I still remember very well how, at some point, Pepsi Cola appeared first, and then Coca Cola appeared, and then, I remember, I was, I don't know, six years old, and then I thought, how can it be that Coca Cola stole the product and did the same thing?

2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:48.480
 So, for people who don't speak Russian, Constantine was talking about basically his first in 1992 interaction with capitalism, which is Pepsi, and at first he discovered Pepsi, and then he discovered Coke, and he was confused how such theft could occur.

2:24:48.480 --> 2:25:05.920
 Yeah, like an intellectual property theft. And remember, Pepsi arrived to the Soviet Union first, and there was some, there's some complicated story, which I don't quite understand the details of, for a while, Pepsi, like, commanded submarines or something.

2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:10.000
 Yeah, Pepsi had like a fleet of Soviet submarines that it was.

2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:20.560
 It was sponsoring tanks and this fessing, and I remember, there's certain things that trickled in, like McDonald's, I remember that was a big deal, certain aspects of the West.

2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:39.280
 Absolutely, so, I mean, we went to McDonald's, and we stood, I mean, this is absurd, right, from kind of looking at it from today's perspective, but we stood in line for like six hours to get into this McDonald's, and, you know, I remember inside, it was just like,

2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:46.640
 a billion people, and I'm just taking a bite out of that Big Mac, and I'm like, wow.

2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:53.280
 What was it, an incredible experience for you? So, like, what is the taste of the West, like, did you enjoy it?

2:25:53.280 --> 2:26:09.200
 I enjoyed the fact that, I mean, this is like, this is getting into the weeds, but I really enjoyed the fact that the top of the bun had those seeds, you know, like, and I remember how on the commercials, like, the Big Mac would kind of bounce.

2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:18.480
 And I was like, the seeds, how do they inject the seeds into the bread, like, amazing, right? So, I think it was, uh, artistry.

2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:21.280
 Yeah, you enjoyed the artistry of the culinary experience.

2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:25.840
 Exactly, it was the, you know, it was the food art, that is the Big Mac.

2:26:25.840 --> 2:26:28.800
 Actually, I still don't know the answer to that, how do they get the sesame seeds on the bun?

2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:31.360
 It's better to not know the answer.

2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:39.120
 You just wander the mystery of it all, yeah, I remember it being exceptionally delicious, but I'm with you, I don't know, you didn't,

2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:50.880
 I mentioned how transformative Pepsi was, but to me, basically sugar based stuff, like Pepsi was, or Coke, I don't remember which one we partook in, but that was an incredible experience.

2:26:50.880 --> 2:27:03.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, absolutely. And, you know, I think it's, you know, it was an important and formative period.

2:27:03.200 --> 2:27:26.400
 I sometimes, I guess, rely on that a little bit, you know, in my daily life, because I remember, like, the early 90s were real rough, you know, like, my parents were kind of on the, on the bottom of the spectrum in terms of, you know, in terms of financial well being.

2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:45.360
 So, kind of like, just when I run into trouble, not like, you know, money trouble, just any kind of trouble these days, it just kind of is not particularly meaningful when you compare it to that, that turbulent time of the early 90s.

2:27:45.360 --> 2:28:00.640
 And the other thing is, I think there's, there's like an advantage to, to being, you know, an immigrant, which is that you get, you go through the mental exercise of changing your environment completely early in your life, right?

2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:22.640
 You go, it's by no means, you know, pleasant in the moment, right? But, like, going into Japanese elementary school, right? Like, I didn't go to some, like, private, you know, thing. I just went to a regular, like, Japanese public elementary school, and that was the non Japanese person in my class.

2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:32.960
 So, just like the learning Japanese and just kind of. So, that's a super humbling experience in many ways was when you, like, made fun of all that kind of stuff. Oh, yeah. Being the outsider.

2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:44.240
 Oh, absolutely. But, you know, you kind of do, you kind of do that. And then you kind of, then you're just kind of are okay with, with stuff, you know what I mean?

2:28:44.240 --> 2:29:02.240
 And so, like, doing that again in middle school in the US, it was arguably easy because it was like, yeah, well, I've already done this before. So, I think it kind of prepares you mentally a little bit for, for switching up for whatever, you know, changes that will come up for the rest of, of your life.

2:29:02.240 --> 2:29:14.800
 So, I wouldn't trade that, that experience really for anything. It's a huge aspect of, of who I am. And I'm sure you can relate to a lot of this.

2:29:14.800 --> 2:29:26.720
 Yes. Is there advice from your life that you can give to young people today, high school, college, you know, about their career, or maybe about life in general?

2:29:26.720 --> 2:29:48.640
 I'm not like a career coach by life coach, right? Like, I'm definitely not a life coach. I don't have it all figured out. But I think there's a, there's a perpetual cycle of, you know, thinking that there is a, there's kind of like a template for success, right?

2:29:48.640 --> 2:30:07.520
 Maybe there is, but in my experience, I haven't seen it, right? You know, I would say people in high school, right? So much of their focus is on getting straight A's, filling their CV with this and this and this.

2:30:07.520 --> 2:30:28.160
 So that, it looks impressive, right? That, that is not, I think, a good way to optimize your life, right? Do the thing that fills your life with passion. Do the thing that fills your life with, with interest and, you know, do that perpetually, right?

2:30:28.160 --> 2:30:55.120
 A straight A student, you know, is really impressive, but also, you know, somewhat boring, right? So, so I, I think, you know, injection of more of that kind of interest into, into the lives of young people would go a long way in, in just both upping their level of happiness and then just kind of ensuring that looking forward,

2:30:55.120 --> 2:31:04.800
 they are not suffering from a, you know, perpetual condition of, oh, I have to satisfy these like, you know, check boxes to, to do well, right?

2:31:04.800 --> 2:31:21.520
 Because you can lose yourself in that whole process for the rest of your life. But it's nice if it's possible, like Max Tecmark was exceptionally good at this at MIT, figure out how you can spend a small part of your percent of your efforts, such that your CV looks really impressive.

2:31:21.520 --> 2:31:29.280
 Yeah, absolutely. There's no, like, without a doubt, like, that's, that's a baseline that you need to have.

2:31:29.280 --> 2:31:45.280
 And then spend, so like, spend most of your time doing like amazing things you're passionate about, but such that it kind of like Planet Nine produces objects that, that feed your CV, like, slowly over time.

2:31:45.280 --> 2:32:02.720
 So getting good grades in high school, maybe doing extracurricular activities or, or in terms of like, you know, for programmers that's producing code that you can show up on GitHub, like leaving traces, like, throughout your efforts such that your CV looks impressive to the rest of the world.

2:32:02.720 --> 2:32:14.160
 In fact, I mean, this is somewhat along the lines of what I'm talking about. See, like, getting like good grades is important, but grades are not a tangible, like, product.

2:32:14.160 --> 2:32:32.800
 Like, you cannot show your A and have your A live a separate life from you. Code very much does, right? Music very much takes on, you know, provided somebody else listens to it, right? Provide, like, takes on a life of its own.

2:32:32.800 --> 2:32:50.000
 That's kind of what I mean, right? Doing, doing stuff that, that can then get separated from, from you is, is exceptionally attractive, right? It's like a, it's like a fun, and it's, and it's also very impressive to others.

2:32:50.000 --> 2:33:10.320
 I think we're moving to a world where grades mean less and less, like certifications mean less and less. If you look at, especially again, in the computing fields, getting a degree, finishing your, currently just get it, finishing your degree, whether it's Bachelors or Masters of PhD is less important than the things you've actually put out into the world.

2:33:10.320 --> 2:33:20.720
 Right, right. And that's a fascinating kind of, that's great that in that sense, the meritocracy in its richest, most beautiful form is, is starting to win out.

2:33:20.720 --> 2:33:39.440
 Yeah, it's weird because like, you know, my understanding, and I'm not like, I don't know the history of science well enough to, to speak very confidently about this, but, you know, the advisor of my advisor of my advisor from undergrad, like, didn't have a PhD.

2:33:39.440 --> 2:34:03.600
 Right, so I think it was a more common thing back in the day, even in the academic sector, to, you know, not have, you know, Faraday, like Faraday didn't know algebra, right, and drew diagrams about, you know, magnetic fields, like his Faraday's law was derived entirely from intuition.

2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:18.640
 So, it is interesting to, to how the world of academia has evolved into a, you got to do this and then get PhD, then you have to postdoc once and twice and maybe thrice and then, like, you, you move on.

2:34:18.640 --> 2:34:25.440
 So, you know, it does, I do wonder, you know, if we're, you know, if there's a better approach.

2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:32.720
 I think we're heading there, but it's a fascinating historical perspective, like that we might have just tried this whole thing out for a while,

2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:38.000
 where we put a lot more emphasis on grades and certificates and degrees and all those kinds of things.

2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:50.160
 I think the difference historically is, like, we can actually, using the internet, show off the, show off ourselves and our creations better and better and more effectively,

2:34:50.160 --> 2:34:53.840
 whether that's code or producing videos or all those kinds of things.

2:34:53.840 --> 2:34:54.640
 That's right.

2:34:54.640 --> 2:34:56.320
 It can become a certified drone pilot.

2:34:56.320 --> 2:34:59.760
 Of all the things you want to pick, yeah, for sure.

2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:06.080
 Or you could just fly and make YouTube videos against hundreds of thousands of views with your drone and never getting a certificate.

2:35:06.080 --> 2:35:07.600
 That's probably illegal.

2:35:07.600 --> 2:35:08.480
 Don't do it.

2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:11.200
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

2:35:11.200 --> 2:35:19.680
 So, you look at planets, they seem to orbit stuff without, without asking the why question.

2:35:19.680 --> 2:35:26.560
 And for some reason, life emerged on earth such that it led to big brains that can ask the big why question.

2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:28.560
 Do you think there's an answer to it?

2:35:31.920 --> 2:35:33.280
 I'm not sure what the question is.

2:35:33.280 --> 2:35:34.080
 Like, what do you think?

2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:34.800
 Meaning of life?

2:35:34.800 --> 2:35:35.840
 The meaning of life.

2:35:37.040 --> 2:35:37.680
 It's 42.

2:35:37.680 --> 2:35:38.640
 It's 42.

2:35:38.640 --> 2:35:39.120
 Yeah.

2:35:39.120 --> 2:35:47.280
 But, you know, aside from that, it's, you know, why, I think there is a big question.

2:35:47.280 --> 2:35:54.640
 Why, I think if the question you're asking is like, why we do all this, right?

2:35:54.640 --> 2:35:55.760
 Why we do all this.

2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:00.400
 It's part of the human condition, right?

2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:11.920
 Human beings are fundamentally, I feel like, non, like sort of stochastic and fundamentally interested in, in

2:36:11.920 --> 2:36:19.200
 kind of expanding our own understanding of the world around us.

2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:22.800
 And creating stuff to enable that understanding.

2:36:22.800 --> 2:36:25.200
 So, we're like stochastic, fundamentally stochastic.

2:36:25.200 --> 2:36:30.160
 So, like, there's just a bunch of randomness that really doesn't seem like it has a good explanation.

2:36:30.160 --> 2:36:35.600
 And yet, there's a kind of direction to our being that we just keep wanting to create and to understand.

2:36:35.600 --> 2:36:36.240
 That's right.

2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:42.240
 So, we're, you know, that claim to be anti science, right?

2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:51.360
 And yet, in their anti science, you know, discussion, like, well, like, if you're so, you know, scientific,

2:36:51.360 --> 2:36:55.200
 then how, why don't you explain to me how, I don't know, this works.

2:36:55.200 --> 2:37:03.760
 And like, it always, there's that fundamental seed of curiosity and interest that is common to all of us.

2:37:03.760 --> 2:37:07.200
 Is absolutely what makes us human, right?

2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:16.960
 And, and I'm in a privileged position of being able to, you know, to have that be my job, right?

2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:25.680
 I think as, you know, as time evolves forward, you know, and the kind of economy changes,

2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:30.400
 I mean, we're already starting to see, you know, a shift towards that type of, you know,

2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:38.880
 creative, you know, enterprise as being, as merging, taking over a bigger and bigger chunk of the sector.

2:37:38.880 --> 2:37:44.960
 It's not yet, I think, the dominant portion of the economy by any account.

2:37:44.960 --> 2:37:52.640
 But if we compare this to like, you know, the time when the dominant thing you would do would be to,

2:37:52.640 --> 2:37:57.120
 you know, go to a factory and do the same exact thing, right?

2:37:57.120 --> 2:38:02.400
 I think, you know, there is a tide there and things are sort of headed in that direction.

2:38:02.400 --> 2:38:04.320
 Yeah, life's becoming more and more fun.

2:38:04.320 --> 2:38:06.640
 I can't wait, honestly, what happens next.

2:38:06.640 --> 2:38:08.080
 You can't wait to just chill.

2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:08.880
 Just chill.

2:38:08.880 --> 2:38:14.720
 The terminal point of this is just chill and wait for those Kuiper Belt objects to complete one orbit.

2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:16.400
 I'm going to credit you with this idea.

2:38:17.120 --> 2:38:24.240
 I do hope that we definitively discover a proof that there is a Planet Nine out there in the next

2:38:24.240 --> 2:38:30.400
 few years so you can sit back with a cigar, a cigarette, or vodka, or wine and just say,

2:38:30.400 --> 2:38:31.200
 I told you so.

2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:32.880
 That's already happening.

2:38:33.680 --> 2:38:34.960
 I'm going to do that later today.

2:38:36.320 --> 2:38:40.320
 As I mentioned, confidence is essential to being a rock star.

2:38:40.320 --> 2:38:44.960
 I really appreciate you explaining so many fascinating things to me today.

2:38:44.960 --> 2:38:47.120
 I really appreciate the work that you do out there.

2:38:47.680 --> 2:38:50.800
 And I really appreciate you talking with me today.

2:38:50.800 --> 2:38:50.800
 Thanks, Constantine.

2:38:50.800 --> 2:38:51.840
 It was a pleasure.

2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:52.800
 Thanks for having me on.

2:38:52.800 --> 2:38:56.800
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Constantine Batigan.

2:38:56.800 --> 2:39:01.760
 And thank you to Squarespace, Literati, Onit, and NI.

2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:05.200
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:10.240
 And now let me leave you with some words from Douglas Adams in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the

2:39:10.240 --> 2:39:10.800
 Galaxy.

2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:18.640
 Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the

2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:22.640
 galaxy lies a small, unregarded yellow sun.

2:39:23.680 --> 2:39:29.920
 Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 92 million miles is an utterly insignificant

2:39:29.920 --> 2:39:36.480
 little blue green planet whose ape descendant life forms are so amazingly primitive that

2:39:36.480 --> 2:39:40.480
 they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.

2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:42.640
 Thank you for listening.

2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:52.640
 I hope to see you next time.
