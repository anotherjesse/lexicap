00:00.000 --> 00:03.960
 If you read a half hour a night, the calculation I came to is that you can read a thousand

00:03.960 --> 00:05.360
 books in 50 years.

00:05.360 --> 00:10.160
 All of the components are there to engineer intimate experiences.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.440
 Extraterrestrial life is a true mystery, the most tantalizing mystery of all.

00:13.440 --> 00:19.900
 How many humans need to disappear for us to be completely lost?

00:19.900 --> 00:25.440
 The following is a conversation with Tim Urban, author and illustrator of the amazing blog

00:25.440 --> 00:28.220
 called Wait But Why.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.120
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:30.120 --> 00:33.440
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:33.440 --> 00:38.480
 And now, dear friends, here's Tim Urban.

00:38.480 --> 00:44.000
 You wrote a Wait But Why blog post about the big and the small, from the observable universe

00:44.000 --> 00:45.800
 to the atom.

00:45.800 --> 00:50.800
 What world do you find most mysterious or beautiful, the very big or the very small?

00:50.800 --> 00:54.800
 The very small seems a lot more mysterious.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.880
 The very big I feel like we kind of understand.

00:56.880 --> 01:02.440
 Not the very, very big, not the multiverse, if there is a multiverse, not anything outside

01:02.440 --> 01:05.680
 of the observable universe.

01:05.680 --> 01:10.920
 But the very small, I think we really have no idea what's going on, are very much less

01:10.920 --> 01:11.920
 idea.

01:11.920 --> 01:17.280
 But I find that, so I think the small is more mysterious, but I think the big is sexier.

01:17.280 --> 01:26.680
 I just cannot get enough of the bigness of space and the farness of stars.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.960
 And it just continually blows my mind.

01:28.960 --> 01:34.960
 I mean, we still, the vastness of the observable universe has the mystery that we don't know

01:34.960 --> 01:35.960
 what's out there.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.360
 We know how it works, perhaps.

01:38.360 --> 01:43.680
 Like general relativity can tell us how the movement of bodies works, how they're born,

01:43.680 --> 01:45.480
 all that kind of things.

01:45.480 --> 01:50.040
 But how many civilizations are out there?

01:50.040 --> 01:51.960
 What are the weird things that are out there?

01:51.960 --> 01:56.000
 Oh yeah, life, well, extraterrestrial life is a true mystery, the most tantalizing mystery

01:56.000 --> 01:58.440
 of all.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.120
 But that's like our size.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.760
 So that's maybe the actual, the big and the small are really cool, but it's actually the

02:04.760 --> 02:08.160
 things that are potentially our size that are the most tantalizing.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.200
 Potentially our size is probably the key word.

02:10.200 --> 02:13.560
 Yeah, I mean, I wonder how small intelligent life could get.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.680
 Probably not that small.

02:15.680 --> 02:20.040
 And I assume that there's a limit that you're not gonna, I mean, you might have like a whale,

02:20.040 --> 02:23.400
 blue whale size intelligent being, that would be kind of cool.

02:23.400 --> 02:27.880
 But I feel like it's, we're in the range of order of magnitude smaller and bigger than

02:27.880 --> 02:28.880
 us for life.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
 But maybe, maybe not.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.320
 Maybe you could have some giant life form.

02:32.320 --> 02:36.560
 Just seems like, I don't know, there's gotta be some reason that anything intelligence

02:36.560 --> 02:42.160
 between kind of like a little tiny rodent or finger monkey up to a blue whale on this

02:42.160 --> 02:46.480
 planet, I don't know, maybe, maybe when you change the gravity, you know, gravity and

02:46.480 --> 02:47.480
 other things.

02:47.480 --> 02:52.960
 Well, you could think of life as a thing of self assembling organisms and they just get

02:52.960 --> 02:54.120
 bigger and bigger and bigger.

02:54.120 --> 02:58.120
 Like there's no such thing as a human being, a human being is made up of a bunch of tiny

02:58.120 --> 03:03.120
 organisms that are working together and we somehow envision that as one entity because

03:03.120 --> 03:04.620
 it has consciousness.

03:04.620 --> 03:10.080
 But maybe it's just organisms on top of organisms, organisms all the way down, turtles all the

03:10.080 --> 03:11.080
 way down.

03:11.080 --> 03:18.440
 And earth can be seen as an organism for people, for alien species that's very different.

03:18.440 --> 03:23.640
 Like why is the human, the fundamental entity that is living?

03:23.640 --> 03:28.480
 And then everything else is just either a collection of humans or components of humans.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.720
 I think of it kind of as, if you think about, I think of like an emergence elevator.

03:32.720 --> 03:39.800
 And so you've got an ant is on one floor and then an ant colony is a floor above, or maybe

03:39.800 --> 03:43.480
 there's even units within the colony that's one floor above and the full colony is two

03:43.480 --> 03:44.740
 floors above.

03:44.740 --> 03:49.480
 And to me, I think that it's the colony that is closest to being the animal.

03:49.480 --> 03:56.840
 It's like the individual thing that competes with others while the individual ants are

03:56.840 --> 03:59.200
 like cells in the animal's body.

03:59.200 --> 04:04.600
 We are more like a colony in that regard, but the humans are weird because we kind of,

04:04.600 --> 04:09.920
 I think of it, if emergence happens in an emergence tower, when you've got kind of cells

04:09.920 --> 04:15.080
 and then humans and communities and societies, ants are very specific.

04:15.080 --> 04:19.320
 The individual ants are always cooperating with each other for the sake of the colony.

04:19.320 --> 04:23.280
 So the colony is this unit that is the competitive unit.

04:23.280 --> 04:27.600
 Humans can kind of go, we take the elevator up and down, emergence tower psychologically.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.480
 Sometimes we are individuals that are competing with other individuals and that's where our

04:32.480 --> 04:33.480
 mindset is.

04:33.480 --> 04:39.520
 Sometimes we get in this crazy zone, a protest or a sporting event and you're just chanting

04:39.520 --> 04:43.440
 and screaming and doing the same hand motions with all these other people and you feel like

04:43.440 --> 04:44.440
 one.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.440
 You feel like one and you would sacrifice yourself and that's with soldiers.

04:47.440 --> 04:52.600
 So our brains can kind of psychologically go up and down this elevator in an interesting

04:52.600 --> 04:53.600
 way.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.600
 Yeah.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.360
 I wonder how much of that is just the narrative we tell ourselves.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.120
 Maybe we are just like an ant colony.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.840
 We're just collaborating always.

05:00.840 --> 05:06.400
 And in our stories of individualism, of like the freedom of the individual, like this kind

05:06.400 --> 05:13.160
 of isolation, lone man on an island kind of thing, we're actually all part of this giant

05:13.160 --> 05:21.120
 network of maybe one of the things that makes humans who we are is probably deeply social,

05:21.120 --> 05:26.640
 the ability to maintain not just the single human intelligence but like a collective intelligence.

05:26.640 --> 05:33.200
 And so this feeling like individual is just because we woke up at this level of the hierarchy.

05:33.200 --> 05:39.920
 So we make it special but we very well could be just part of the ant colony.

05:39.920 --> 05:44.200
 This whole conversation, I'm either going to be doing a Shakespearean analysis of your

05:44.200 --> 05:49.680
 Twitter, your writing or very specific statements that you've made.

05:49.680 --> 05:55.040
 So you've written answers to a mailbag of questions.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.720
 The questions were amazing, the ones you've chosen and your answers were amazing.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.200
 So on this topic of the big and the small, somebody asked, are we bigger than we are

06:02.200 --> 06:05.160
 small or smaller than we are big?

06:05.160 --> 06:06.160
 Who's asking these questions?

06:06.160 --> 06:08.040
 This is really good.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.760
 You have amazing fans.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.760
 Okay.

06:10.760 --> 06:18.600
 So where do we sit at this level of the very small to the very big?

06:18.600 --> 06:21.520
 So are we bigger or are we smaller, are we bigger than we are small?

06:21.520 --> 06:23.880
 I think it depends on what we're asking here.

06:23.880 --> 06:31.120
 So if we're talking about the biggest thing that we kind of can talk about without just

06:31.120 --> 06:36.040
 imagining is the observable universe, the Hubble sphere.

06:36.040 --> 06:41.760
 And that's about 10 to the 26th meters in diameter.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.520
 The smallest thing we talk about is a plank length.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.280
 But you could argue that that's kind of an imaginary thing.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.520
 But that's 10 to the negative 35.

06:49.520 --> 06:53.920
 Now we're about conveniently about 10 to the 1, not quite, 10 to the 0.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.040
 We're about 10 to the 0 meters long.

06:57.040 --> 07:03.280
 So it's easy because you can just look and say, okay, well, for example, atoms are like

07:03.280 --> 07:07.960
 10 to the negative 15th or 10 to the negative 16th meters across, right?

07:07.960 --> 07:12.720
 If you go 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 16th, which is right, that's now, so an atom to

07:12.720 --> 07:17.200
 us is us to this, you get to like nebulas, smaller than a galaxy and bigger than the

07:17.200 --> 07:18.680
 biggest star.

07:18.680 --> 07:22.880
 So we're right in between nebula and an atom.

07:22.880 --> 07:27.640
 Now if you want to go down to quark level, you might be able to get up to galaxy level.

07:27.640 --> 07:31.960
 When you go up to the observable universe, you're getting down on the small side to things

07:31.960 --> 07:39.880
 that we I think are mostly theoretically imagining are there and hypothesizing are there.

07:39.880 --> 07:45.880
 So I think as far as real world objects that we really know a lot about, I would say we

07:45.880 --> 07:48.920
 are smaller than we are big.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.680
 But if you want to go down to the plank length, we're very quickly, we're bigger than we are

07:51.680 --> 07:52.680
 small.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.680
 If you think about strings.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.680
 Yeah.

07:54.680 --> 07:55.680
 String.

07:55.680 --> 07:56.680
 Exactly.

07:56.680 --> 07:57.680
 String theory and so on.

07:57.680 --> 07:58.680
 That's interesting.

07:58.680 --> 08:02.160
 But I think like you answer, no matter what, we're kind of middleish.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.160
 Yeah.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.680
 I mean, here's something cool.

08:04.680 --> 08:08.600
 If a human is a neutrino, and again, neutrino, the size doesn't really make sense.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.840
 It's not really a size.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.880
 But when we talk about some of these neutrinos, I mean, if a neutrino is a human, a proton

08:13.880 --> 08:15.560
 is the sun.

08:15.560 --> 08:22.480
 So that's like, I mean, a proton is real small, like really small.

08:22.480 --> 08:28.280
 And so, yeah, the small gets like crazy small very quickly.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.560
 Let's talk about aliens.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.960
 We already mentioned it.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.160
 Let's start just by with the basic, what's your intuition as of today?

08:36.160 --> 08:40.680
 This is a thing that could change day by day, but how many alien civilizations out there?

08:40.680 --> 08:42.440
 Is it zero?

08:42.440 --> 08:45.280
 Is it a handful?

08:45.280 --> 08:52.480
 Is it almost endless, like the observable universe or the universe is teeming with life?

08:52.480 --> 08:56.320
 If I had gun to my head, I have to take a guess.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.920
 I would say it's teeming with life.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.120
 I would say there is.

08:59.120 --> 09:05.600
 I think running a Monte Carlo simulation, this paper by Anders Sandberg and Drexler and

09:05.600 --> 09:08.800
 a few others a couple of years ago, I think you probably know about it.

09:08.800 --> 09:18.880
 I think they're the mean, you know, using different, you know, running through randomized

09:18.880 --> 09:25.920
 rake equation multiplication, you ended up with 27 million as the mean of intelligent

09:25.920 --> 09:29.160
 civilizations in the galaxy, in the Milky Way alone.

09:29.160 --> 09:33.600
 And so then if you go outside the Milky Way, that would turn into trillions.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.600
 That's the mean.

09:35.600 --> 09:41.120
 Now what's interesting is that there's a long tail because they believe some of these multipliers

09:41.120 --> 09:42.120
 in the Drake equation.

09:42.120 --> 09:49.360
 So for example, the probability that life starts in the first place, they think that

09:49.360 --> 09:57.000
 the kind of range that we use is for that variable or is way too small and that's constraining

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
 our possibilities.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.320
 And if you actually extend it to, you know, some, some crazy number of orders of magnitude

10:03.320 --> 10:10.080
 like 200, they think that that variable should be, you get this long tail where, I forget

10:10.080 --> 10:15.880
 the exact number, but it's like a third or a quarter of the total outcomes have us alone.

10:15.880 --> 10:20.320
 Like, you know, I think it's like, I think it's a sizable percentage has us as the only

10:20.320 --> 10:23.920
 intelligent life in the galaxy, but you can keep going.

10:23.920 --> 10:28.960
 And I think there's like, you know, a non zero like legitimate amount of outcomes there

10:28.960 --> 10:33.480
 that have us as the only life in the observable universe at all is on earth.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.520
 I mean, seems incredibly counterintuitive.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.640
 It seems like, you know, you mentioned that people think you're, you know, you must be

10:39.640 --> 10:43.720
 an idiot because, you know, if you picked up one grain of sand on a beach and examined

10:43.720 --> 10:47.200
 it and you found all these little things on it, it's like saying, well, maybe this is

10:47.200 --> 10:48.680
 the only one that has that.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.000
 And it's like, probably not.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.520
 They're probably most of the sand, probably you're a lot of the sand, right?

10:53.520 --> 10:56.800
 So on, and then the other hand, we don't see anything, we don't see any evidence, you

10:56.800 --> 11:01.680
 know, which of course, people would say that the people who scoff at the concept that we're

11:01.680 --> 11:07.080
 potentially alone, they say, well, of course, there's lots of reasons we wouldn't have seen

11:07.080 --> 11:11.400
 anything and they can go list them and they're very compelling.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.160
 But we don't know.

11:13.160 --> 11:16.240
 And the truth is, if there were, if this were a freak thing, I mean, we don't, if this

11:16.240 --> 11:20.640
 were a completely freak thing that happened here, whether it's life at all or just getting

11:20.640 --> 11:27.240
 to this level of intelligence, that species, whoever it was, would think there must be

11:27.240 --> 11:29.520
 lots of us out there and they'd be wrong.

11:29.520 --> 11:33.240
 So just being, again, using the same intuition that most people would use, I'd say there's

11:33.240 --> 11:35.240
 probably lots of other things out there.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.240
 Yeah.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.720
 And you wrote a great blog post about it.

11:37.720 --> 11:44.360
 But to me, the two interesting reasons that we haven't been in contact, I too have an

11:44.360 --> 11:47.680
 intuition that the universe is teeming with life.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.880
 So one interesting is around the great filter.

11:50.880 --> 11:55.360
 So we're either the great filters either behind us or in front of us.

11:55.360 --> 12:01.520
 So the reason that's interesting is you get to think about what kind of things ensure

12:01.520 --> 12:07.160
 or ensure the survival of an intelligence civilization or lead to the destruction of

12:07.160 --> 12:08.160
 intelligence civilization.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.560
 That's a very pragmatic, very important question to always be asking.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.560
 And we'll talk about some of those.

12:13.560 --> 12:19.680
 And then the other one is I'm saddened by the possibility that there could be aliens

12:19.680 --> 12:21.720
 communicating with us all the time.

12:21.720 --> 12:29.760
 In fact, they may have visited and we're just too dumb to hear it, to see it.

12:29.760 --> 12:36.200
 Like the idea that the kind of life that can evolve is just the range of life that can

12:36.200 --> 12:42.840
 evolve is so large that our narrow view of what is life and what is intelligent life

12:42.840 --> 12:45.920
 is preventing us from having communication with them.

12:45.920 --> 12:50.440
 But then they don't seem very smart because if they were trying to communicate with us,

12:50.440 --> 12:56.040
 they would surely, if they were super intelligent, they would be very, I'm sure if there's lots

12:56.040 --> 13:01.240
 of life, we're not that rare, we're not some crazy weird species that hears and has different

13:01.240 --> 13:04.800
 kinds of ways of perceiving signals.

13:04.800 --> 13:08.480
 So they would probably be able to see, if you really wanted to communicate with an earth

13:08.480 --> 13:14.160
 like species, with a human like species, you would send out all kinds of things.

13:14.160 --> 13:20.760
 You'd send out, you know, radio waves and you send out gravity waves and lots of things.

13:20.760 --> 13:24.640
 So if they're communicating in a way, they're trying to communicate with us and it's just

13:24.640 --> 13:26.040
 we're too dumb to perceive the signals.

13:26.040 --> 13:32.160
 It's like, well, they're not doing a great job of considering the primitive species we

13:32.160 --> 13:33.160
 might be.

13:33.160 --> 13:39.880
 But I don't know, I think if a super intelligent species wanted to get in touch with us and

13:39.880 --> 13:43.640
 had the capability of, I think probably they would.

13:43.640 --> 13:50.000
 Well, they may be getting in touch with us, they're just getting in touch with the thing

13:50.000 --> 13:53.800
 that we humans are not understanding that they're getting in touch with us with.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.680
 I guess that's what I was trying to say is there could be something about earth that's

13:57.680 --> 14:00.360
 much more special than us humans.

14:00.360 --> 14:06.440
 Like the nature of the intelligence that's on earth or the thing that's of value and

14:06.440 --> 14:10.840
 that's curious and that's complicated and fascinating and beautiful.

14:10.840 --> 14:17.040
 Maybe something that's not just like tweets, okay, like English language that's interpretable

14:17.040 --> 14:22.840
 or any kind of language or any kind of signal, whether it's gravity or radio signal that

14:22.840 --> 14:25.880
 humans seem to appreciate.

14:25.880 --> 14:29.640
 Why not the actual, it could be the process of evolution itself.

14:29.640 --> 14:34.040
 It could be something about the way that earth is breathing essentially through the creation

14:34.040 --> 14:38.680
 of life and this complex growth of life.

14:38.680 --> 14:44.320
 It's a whole different way to view organisms and view life that could be getting communicated

14:44.320 --> 14:49.760
 with and we humans are just a tiny fingertip on top of that intelligence and the communication

14:49.760 --> 14:56.760
 is happening with the main mothership of earth versus us humans that seem to treat ourselves

14:56.760 --> 15:00.320
 as super important and we're missing the big picture.

15:00.320 --> 15:06.000
 I mean, it sounds crazy, but our understanding of what is intelligent, of what is life, what

15:06.000 --> 15:11.920
 is consciousness is very limited and it seems to be, and just being very suspicious, it

15:11.920 --> 15:14.520
 seems to be awfully human centric.

15:14.520 --> 15:23.760
 Like this story, it seems like the progress of science is constantly putting humans down

15:23.760 --> 15:31.120
 on the importance, like on the cosmic importance, the ranking of how big we are, how important

15:31.120 --> 15:35.760
 we are, that seems to be the more we discovered that's what's happening and I think science

15:35.760 --> 15:36.760
 is very young.

15:36.760 --> 15:41.240
 And so I think eventually we might figure out that there's something much, much bigger

15:41.240 --> 15:46.640
 going on, that humans are just a curious little side effect of the much bigger thing.

15:46.640 --> 15:50.480
 That's what, I mean, that, as I'm saying, it just sounds insane, but

15:50.480 --> 15:58.120
 well, it just, it sounds a little like religious, it sounds like a spiritual, you know, it gets

15:58.120 --> 16:02.240
 to that realm where there's something that more than meets the eye.

16:02.240 --> 16:11.200
 Well, yeah, but not so religious and spiritual often of this kind of woo woo characteristic,

16:11.200 --> 16:14.840
 like when people write books about them, then go to wars over whatever the heck is written

16:14.840 --> 16:20.360
 in those books, I mean, more like it's possible that collective intelligence is more important

16:20.360 --> 16:22.360
 than this individual intelligence, right?

16:22.360 --> 16:24.840
 It's the ant colony, what's the primal organism?

16:24.840 --> 16:26.640
 Is it the ant colony or is it the ant?

16:26.640 --> 16:31.120
 Yeah, I mean, humans, just like, you know, any individual ant can't do shit, but the

16:31.120 --> 16:36.240
 colony can make these incredible structures and has this intelligence and we're exactly

16:36.240 --> 16:37.240
 the same.

16:37.240 --> 16:41.120
 I mean, you know, you know, the famous thing that, you know, no one, no human knows how

16:41.120 --> 16:42.680
 to make a pencil.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.720
 Have you heard this?

16:44.720 --> 16:45.720
 No.

16:45.720 --> 16:46.720
 Basically, I mean,

16:46.720 --> 16:47.720
 This is great.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.680
 It's a single human out there has absolutely no idea how to make a pencil.

16:51.680 --> 16:56.080
 So you have to think about, you have to get the wood, the paint, the different chemicals

16:56.080 --> 16:59.480
 that make up the yellow paint, the eraser is a whole other thing.

16:59.480 --> 17:04.760
 The metal has to be mined from somewhere and then the graphite, whatever that is.

17:04.760 --> 17:10.200
 And there's not one person on earth who knows how to kind of collect all those materials

17:10.200 --> 17:14.440
 and create a pencil, but together that's one of the, that's child's play, it's one

17:14.440 --> 17:15.440
 of the easiest things.

17:15.440 --> 17:20.160
 So, you know, the other thing I like to think about, I actually put this as a question on

17:20.160 --> 17:22.480
 the blog once.

17:22.480 --> 17:26.080
 There's a thought experiment and I actually want to hear what you think.

17:26.080 --> 17:33.800
 So if a witch, kind of a dickish witch comes around and she says, I'm going to cast a spell

17:33.800 --> 17:40.560
 on all of humanity and all material things that you've invented are going to disappear

17:40.560 --> 17:41.560
 all at once.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.040
 So suddenly we're all standing there naked.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.760
 There's no buildings.

17:44.760 --> 17:49.960
 There's, there's, there's no cars and boats and ships and no mines, nothing, right?

17:49.960 --> 17:53.640
 It's just the stone age earth and a bunch of naked humans, but we're all the same.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.640
 We have the same brain.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.120
 So we're all know what's going on.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.120
 And we all got a note from her.

17:57.120 --> 18:01.680
 So we understand the deal and she says, she communicated to every human, here's the deal.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.040
 You lost all your stuff.

18:04.040 --> 18:09.720
 You guys need to make one working iPhone 13 and you make one working iPhone 13 that could

18:09.720 --> 18:15.120
 pass in the Apple store today, you know, in your previous world for an iPhone 13, then

18:15.120 --> 18:16.520
 I will restore everything.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.520
 How long do you think?

18:17.520 --> 18:19.080
 And so everyone knows this is, this is the mission.

18:19.080 --> 18:22.720
 We're all aware of the mission, everyone, all humans.

18:22.720 --> 18:23.720
 How long would it take us?

18:23.720 --> 18:25.280
 That's a really interesting question.

18:25.280 --> 18:30.120
 So obviously if you do a random selection of hundred or a thousand humans within the

18:30.120 --> 18:34.680
 population, I think you're screwed to make that iPhone.

18:34.680 --> 18:40.880
 I tend to believe that there's fascinating specialization among the human civilization.

18:40.880 --> 18:46.880
 Like there's a few hackers out there that can like solo build an iPhone.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.600
 With what materials?

18:48.600 --> 18:51.560
 So no materials whatsoever.

18:51.560 --> 18:56.160
 It has to, I mean, it's, it's virtually, I mean, okay, you have to build factories.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.360
 I mean, to, to fabricate.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.360
 Okay.

19:00.360 --> 19:04.800
 And how are you going to mine them, you know, you got to mine the materials where you don't

19:04.800 --> 19:05.800
 have any cranes.

19:05.800 --> 19:06.800
 You don't have any, you know,

19:06.800 --> 19:07.800
 Okay.

19:07.800 --> 19:11.040
 You 100% have to have the, this, everybody's naked.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.040
 Everyone's naked.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.040
 Everyone's where they are.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.040
 So you and I would currently be naked.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.040
 It's on the ground in what used to be Manhattan.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.040
 So no building.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.040
 No grassy island.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.040
 Yeah.

19:19.040 --> 19:23.560
 So you need a naked Elon Musk type character to then start building a company.

19:23.560 --> 19:24.560
 Yes.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.560
 You have to have a large company then.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.560
 Right.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.120
 And see if you know where he, you know, where is everyone, you know, oh shit, how am I going

19:29.120 --> 19:30.360
 to find other people I need to talk to?

19:30.360 --> 19:33.680
 But we have all the knowledge of, yeah, everyone has the knowledge that's in their current

19:33.680 --> 19:34.680
 brains.

19:34.680 --> 19:35.680
 Yeah.

19:35.680 --> 19:39.880
 I've met some legit engineers, crazy, crazy polymath people.

19:39.880 --> 19:40.880
 Yeah.

19:40.880 --> 19:47.920
 But the actual labor of, cause you said, cause like the, the original Mac, like the Apple

19:47.920 --> 19:53.240
 two, that can be built, but even that, you know, even that's going to be tough.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.280
 Well, I think part of it is a communication problem.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.360
 If you could suddenly have, you know, someone, if everyone had a walkie talkie and there

19:58.360 --> 20:01.920
 was, you know, a couple, you know, 10 really smart people were designated the leaders.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.960
 They could say, okay, I want, you know, everyone who can do this to, to walk West, you know,

20:05.960 --> 20:08.920
 until you get to this little hub and everyone else, you know, and they could, they could

20:08.920 --> 20:11.160
 actually coordinate, but we don't have that.

20:11.160 --> 20:14.560
 So it's like people just, you know, and then what I think about is, so you've got some

20:14.560 --> 20:17.160
 people that are like trying to organize and you, you'll have a little community where

20:17.160 --> 20:20.000
 a couple hundred people have come together and maybe a couple thousand have organized

20:20.000 --> 20:23.200
 and they designated one person, you know, as the leader and then they have sub leaders

20:23.200 --> 20:26.360
 and okay, we have a start here, we have some organization.

20:26.360 --> 20:30.040
 They're also going to have some people that say, good, humans were a scourge upon the

20:30.040 --> 20:32.760
 earth and this is good and they're going to try to sabotage, they're going to try to

20:32.760 --> 20:37.800
 murder the people with the, and who know what they're talking about.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.920
 The elite that, that, that possessed the knowledge.

20:40.920 --> 20:44.240
 Well, and so maybe everyone's hopeful for the, you know, we're all civilized and hopeful

20:44.240 --> 20:47.120
 for the first 30 days or something and then things start to fall off.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.600
 You know, people get, start to lose hope and there's new kinds of, you know, new kinds

20:50.600 --> 20:55.000
 of governments popping up, you know, new kinds of societies and they're, they're, they're,

20:55.000 --> 20:59.120
 you know, and they don't play nicely with the other ones and, and I think very quickly,

20:59.120 --> 21:01.200
 I think a lot of people will just give up and say, you know what, this is it, we're

21:01.200 --> 21:04.480
 back in the stone age, let's just create, you know, agrarian, we don't also don't know

21:04.480 --> 21:05.480
 how to farm.

21:05.480 --> 21:06.480
 No one knows how to farm.

21:06.480 --> 21:09.600
 There's like, even the, even the farmers, you know, a lot of them are relying on their

21:09.600 --> 21:15.520
 machines and so we also are going to be a lot of mass starvation and that, you know,

21:15.520 --> 21:19.280
 when you're trying to organize, a lot of people are, you know, coming in with, you know, spears

21:19.280 --> 21:22.240
 they've fashioned and trying to murder everyone who has food.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.640
 It's an interesting question given today society, how much violence would that be?

21:25.640 --> 21:28.160
 We've gotten softer, less violent.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.160
 And you don't have weapons.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.160
 So we don't have weapons.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.760
 We have really primitive weapons now.

21:31.760 --> 21:35.280
 But we have a, and also we have a kind of ethics where murder is bad.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.280
 Right.

21:36.280 --> 21:41.040
 It used to be less, like human life was less valued in the past, so murder was more okay,

21:41.040 --> 21:42.040
 like ethically.

21:42.040 --> 21:46.320
 But in the past, they also were really good at figuring out how to have sustenance.

21:46.320 --> 21:49.880
 They knew how to get food and water because they, they were, so we have no idea.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.960
 Like the ancient hunter gatherer societies would laugh at what's going on here.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.040
 They'd say, you guys know, you don't know what you're, none of you know what you're

21:55.040 --> 21:56.040
 doing.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.040
 Yeah.

21:57.040 --> 22:00.720
 And also the amount of people feeding this amount of people in, in the very, in the Stone

22:00.720 --> 22:03.920
 Age, you know, civilization, that's not going to happen.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.760
 So New York and San Francisco are screwed?

22:05.760 --> 22:07.960
 Well, whoever's not near water is really screwed.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.080
 So that's your near river or freshwater river and, you know, anyways, it's a very interesting

22:12.080 --> 22:13.080
 question.

22:13.080 --> 22:18.840
 And what it does, this and the pencil, it makes me feel so grateful and like excited

22:18.840 --> 22:21.680
 about like, man, our civilization is so cool.

22:21.680 --> 22:25.160
 And this is, talk about collective intelligence.

22:25.160 --> 22:28.240
 Humans did not build any of this.

22:28.240 --> 22:34.840
 It's collective human super, collective humans is a super intelligent, you know, being that

22:34.840 --> 22:39.440
 is, that can do absolutely, especially over a long period of time can do such magical

22:39.440 --> 22:40.440
 things.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.440
 And we just get to be born.

22:41.440 --> 22:45.160
 When I go out, when I'm working and I'm hungry, I just go click, click, click and like a salad

22:45.160 --> 22:46.160
 is coming.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.160
 The salad arrives.

22:47.160 --> 22:51.960
 And you think about the incredible infrastructure that's in place for that, for that quickly

22:51.960 --> 22:55.680
 ages the internet to, you know, the electricity, first of all, that's just powering the things,

22:55.680 --> 23:00.280
 you know, how the, where the amount of structures that have to be created and for that electricity

23:00.280 --> 23:01.280
 to be there.

23:01.280 --> 23:05.200
 And then you've got the, of course, the internet and then you have this system where delivery

23:05.200 --> 23:08.080
 drivers and they have their riding bikes that were made by someone else and they're going

23:08.080 --> 23:11.480
 to get the salad and all those ingredients came from all over the place.

23:11.480 --> 23:16.880
 I mean, it's just so I think it's like, I like thinking about these things because it

23:16.880 --> 23:19.240
 makes me feel like just so grateful.

23:19.240 --> 23:22.200
 I'm like, man, it would be so awful if we didn't have this and people, people who didn't

23:22.200 --> 23:26.400
 have it would think this was such magic we live in and we do and like, cool, that's,

23:26.400 --> 23:27.400
 it's fun.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.400
 Yeah.

23:28.400 --> 23:32.120
 One of the most amazing things when I showed up, I came here at 13 from the Soviet Union

23:32.120 --> 23:39.160
 and the supermarket was people don't really realize that, but the abundance of food.

23:39.160 --> 23:43.440
 It's not even, so bananas was the thing I was obsessed about.

23:43.440 --> 23:47.600
 I just ate bananas every day for many, many months because the heaven had bananas in Russia

23:47.600 --> 23:52.600
 and the fact that you can have as many bananas as you want, plus there were like somewhat

23:52.600 --> 23:58.000
 inexpensive relative to the other food and the fact that you can somehow have a system

23:58.000 --> 24:02.720
 that brings bananas to you without having to wait in the long line, all of those things.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.720
 It's magic.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.440
 I mean, also imagine.

24:05.440 --> 24:08.680
 So first of all, the ancient hunter gatherers, you know, picture the mother gathering and

24:08.680 --> 24:09.920
 eating for all this fresh food.

24:09.920 --> 24:10.920
 No.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.040
 So do you know what an avocado used to look like?

24:12.040 --> 24:17.280
 It was a little like a sphere and the fruit of it, the actual avocado part was like a

24:17.280 --> 24:21.600
 little tiny layer around this big pit that took up almost the whole volume.

24:21.600 --> 24:28.400
 We've made crazy robot avocados today that have nothing to do with like what they, so

24:28.400 --> 24:35.800
 same with bananas, these big, sweet, you know, and not infested with bugs and, you know,

24:35.800 --> 24:41.360
 they used to eat the shittiest food and they're eating, you know, uncooked meat or maybe they

24:41.360 --> 24:44.800
 cook it and they're just, it's gross and it's, things rot.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.920
 So you go to the supermarket and it's just, it's just a, it's like crazy super engineered

24:48.920 --> 24:52.800
 cartoon food, fruit and food, and then it's all this processed food, which, you know,

24:52.800 --> 24:55.600
 we complain about in our setting, oh, you know, we complain about, you know, we need too much

24:55.600 --> 24:56.600
 process.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.320
 That's a, this is a good problem.

24:58.320 --> 25:02.120
 I mean, if you imagine what they would think, oh my God, a cracker, you know, delicious

25:02.120 --> 25:08.400
 a cracker would taste to them, you know, candy, you know, pasta and spaghetti, they never

25:08.400 --> 25:12.240
 had anything like this and then you have from all over the world, I mean, things that are

25:12.240 --> 25:17.240
 grown all over the place, all here in nice little racks organized and on a, you know,

25:17.240 --> 25:20.240
 middle class salary, you can afford anything you want.

25:20.240 --> 25:25.240
 I mean, it's again, just like incredible gratitude, like, ah, yeah.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.400
 And the question is how resilient is this whole thing?

25:27.400 --> 25:34.400
 I mean, this is another darker version of your question is if we keep all the material possessions

25:34.400 --> 25:41.160
 we have, but we start knocking out some percent of the population, how resilient is the system

25:41.160 --> 25:42.160
 that we built up?

25:42.160 --> 25:47.800
 Or if we rely on other humans and the knowledge that built up on the past, the distributed

25:47.800 --> 25:53.040
 nature of knowledge, how, how much does it take?

25:53.040 --> 25:57.280
 How many humans need to disappear for us to be completely lost?

25:57.280 --> 26:02.360
 Well, I'm trying to go off one thing, which is Elon Musk says that he has this number

26:02.360 --> 26:10.120
 a million in mind as the order of magnitude of people you need to be on Mars to truly be

26:10.120 --> 26:11.920
 multi planetary.

26:11.920 --> 26:18.840
 Multi planetary doesn't mean, you know, like when Neil Armstrong, you know, goes to the

26:18.840 --> 26:21.160
 moon, that's, they call it a great leap for mankind.

26:21.160 --> 26:22.160
 Yeah.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.800
 It's not a great leap for anything.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.160
 It is a great achievement for mankind.

26:26.160 --> 26:31.720
 And I always like think about if the first fish to kind of go on land just kind of went

26:31.720 --> 26:35.040
 up and gave the shore a high five and goes back into the water, that's not a great leap

26:35.040 --> 26:36.160
 for life.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.160
 That's a great achievement for that fish.

26:37.160 --> 26:40.640
 And there should be a little statue of that fish and, you know, in the water and everyone

26:40.640 --> 26:41.640
 should celebrate the fish.

26:41.640 --> 26:45.000
 But it's, but we talked about a great leap for life.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
 It's permanent.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.720
 It's something that now from now on, this is how things are.

26:48.720 --> 26:53.040
 So this is part of why I get so excited about Mars, by the way, is because you can count

26:53.040 --> 26:59.040
 on one hand, like the number of great leaps that we've had, you know, like no life to

26:59.040 --> 27:05.640
 life and single cell or simple cell to complex cell and single cell organisms to animals,

27:05.640 --> 27:10.920
 to come, you know, multi cell animals and then ocean to land and then one planet to

27:10.920 --> 27:11.920
 two planets.

27:11.920 --> 27:12.920
 Anyway, diversion.

27:12.920 --> 27:19.760
 But the point is that we are officially that leap for all of life, you know, has happened

27:19.760 --> 27:24.120
 once the ships could stop coming from earth because there's some horrible catastrophic

27:24.120 --> 27:27.800
 world war three and everyone dies on earth and they're fine and they can turn that certain

27:27.800 --> 27:32.720
 X number of people into seven billion, you know, population that's thriving just like

27:32.720 --> 27:35.480
 earth, they can build ships, they can come back and recolonize earth because now we

27:35.480 --> 27:38.920
 are officially multi planetary where it's just self sustaining.

27:38.920 --> 27:42.640
 He says a million people is about what he thinks now that might be a specialized group.

27:42.640 --> 27:43.640
 That's great.

27:43.640 --> 27:48.820
 That's very specifically, you know, selected million that has very, very skilled million

27:48.820 --> 27:51.640
 people, not just maybe the average million on earth.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.440
 But I think it depends what you're talking about, but I don't think, you know, so one

27:54.440 --> 27:58.400
 million is one seven thousandth, one eight thousandth of the current population.

27:58.400 --> 28:04.200
 I think you need a very, very, very small fraction of humans on earth to get by.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.760
 Obviously, you're not going to have the same thriving civilization if you get to a too

28:07.760 --> 28:12.040
 small a number, but depends who you're killing off, I guess is part of the question.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.040
 Yeah.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.640
 If you killed off half of the people just randomly right now, I think we'd be fine.

28:15.640 --> 28:18.680
 It would be obviously a great awful tragedy.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.240
 I think if you killed off three quarters of all people randomly, just three out of every

28:21.240 --> 28:22.360
 four people drops dead.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.800
 I think we'd have obviously the stock market would crash.

28:24.800 --> 28:30.520
 We'd have a rough patch, but I almost can assure you that the species would be fine.

28:30.520 --> 28:33.920
 Well, because the million number, like you said, it is specialized.

28:33.920 --> 28:41.720
 So I think because you have to do this, you have to basically do the iPhone experiment,

28:41.720 --> 28:45.600
 like literally you have to be able to be able to manufacture computers.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.600
 Yeah, everything.

28:46.600 --> 28:50.440
 If you're going to have the self sustaining means you can, you know, any major important

28:50.440 --> 28:53.680
 skill, any important piece of interest, you know, kind of infrastructure on earth can

28:53.680 --> 28:56.960
 be built there in this, you know, just as well.

28:56.960 --> 29:02.600
 It'd be interesting to list out what are the important things, what are the important

29:02.600 --> 29:03.600
 skills?

29:03.600 --> 29:04.600
 Yeah.

29:04.600 --> 29:08.960
 I mean, if you have to feed everyone, so, you know, mass farming, things like that,

29:08.960 --> 29:14.160
 you have to, you have to, you have mining these questions, it's like the materials

29:14.160 --> 29:17.840
 might be, I don't know, I don't know, five miles, two miles underground, I don't know

29:17.840 --> 29:22.600
 what the actual, but like, it's amazing to me just that these things got built in the

29:22.600 --> 29:23.600
 first place.

29:23.600 --> 29:27.320
 You know, they never got, no one built the first, the mine that we're getting stuff

29:27.320 --> 29:31.440
 for the iPhone for probably wasn't built for the iPhone, you know, or in general, early

29:31.440 --> 29:35.400
 mining, you know, was for, you know, I think obviously, I assume the industrial revolution

29:35.400 --> 29:40.320
 when we realized, oh, fossil fuels, we want to extract this magical energy source, I assume

29:40.320 --> 29:43.320
 that like mining took a huge leap without knowing very much about this.

29:43.320 --> 29:47.160
 I think, you know, you're going to need, you need mining, you're going to need like a lot

29:47.160 --> 29:50.280
 of electrical engineers, if you're going to have a civilization like ours, and of course

29:50.280 --> 29:53.960
 you could have oil and lanterns, we could go way back, but if you're trying to build

29:53.960 --> 29:58.960
 our today thing, you're going to need, you know, energy and electricity and then, and

29:58.960 --> 30:03.680
 mines that can bring materials, and then you're going to need a ton of plumbing and everything

30:03.680 --> 30:04.680
 that entails.

30:04.680 --> 30:05.680
 Yeah.

30:05.680 --> 30:09.760
 And like you said, food, but also the manufacturer, so like turning raw materials into something

30:09.760 --> 30:10.760
 useful.

30:10.760 --> 30:11.760
 Yeah.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.960
 That whole thing, like factories, some supply chain, transportation.

30:14.960 --> 30:18.520
 Right, you know, I mean, you think about, when we talk about like world hunger, one

30:18.520 --> 30:22.880
 of the major problems is, you know, there's plenty of food and by the time it arrives,

30:22.880 --> 30:27.040
 most of it's gone bad in the truck, you know, in a, in a kind of an impoverished place.

30:27.040 --> 30:30.480
 So it's like, you know, we take, again, we take it so for granted, all the food in the,

30:30.480 --> 30:32.840
 in the supermarket is fresh.

30:32.840 --> 30:33.840
 It's all there.

30:33.840 --> 30:37.760
 And which always stresses me, if I were running a supermarket, I would always be so like miserable

30:37.760 --> 30:41.760
 about like things going bad on the shelves.

30:41.760 --> 30:44.360
 Or if you don't have enough, that's not good, but if you have too much, it goes bad anyway.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.400
 And of course there would be entertainers too.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.960
 Like somebody would have a YouTube channel that's running on Mars.

30:50.960 --> 30:59.120
 There is something different about a civilization on Mars and Earth existing versus like a civilization

30:59.120 --> 31:01.480
 in the United States versus Russia and China.

31:01.480 --> 31:05.240
 Like that, that's a different, fundamentally different distance.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.240
 Like philosophically.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.240
 Yeah.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.240
 The quite, will it be like fuzzy?

31:08.240 --> 31:10.960
 You know, there'll be like a reality show on Mars that everyone on Earth is obsessed

31:10.960 --> 31:11.960
 with.

31:11.960 --> 31:16.080
 You know, if, I think if people are going back and forth enough, then it becomes fuzzy.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.680
 It becomes like, oh, our friends on Mars and there's like this Mars versus Earth, you know,

31:19.680 --> 31:22.600
 like, you know, and it become like fun tribalism.

31:22.600 --> 31:26.240
 I think if people don't rarely go back and forth and it really, they're there for, I

31:26.240 --> 31:29.720
 think if you get kind of like, oh, we hate, you know, a lot of like us versus them stuff

31:29.720 --> 31:30.720
 going on.

31:30.720 --> 31:33.960
 There could be also war and space for territory.

31:33.960 --> 31:41.040
 As a first colony happens, China, Russia, or whoever, the European, different European

31:41.040 --> 31:42.040
 nations.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.400
 Switzerland finally gets their act together and starts wars.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.200
 This is supposed to stay out of all of them.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.200
 Yeah.

31:48.200 --> 31:51.480
 There's all kinds of crazy geopolitical things that like we have not even, no one's really

31:51.480 --> 31:54.520
 even thought about too much yet that, that like, that could get weird.

31:54.520 --> 31:59.480
 Think about the 1500s when it was suddenly like a race to like, you know, colonize or

31:59.480 --> 32:03.320
 capture land or discover new land that hasn't been, you know, so it was like this, this,

32:03.320 --> 32:04.320
 this new frontiers, right?

32:04.320 --> 32:08.000
 And there's not really, you know, the land is not, you know, the thing about Crimea was

32:08.000 --> 32:11.520
 like this huge thing because this tiny peninsula switched.

32:11.520 --> 32:14.240
 That's how like optimized everything has become.

32:14.240 --> 32:16.520
 Everything has just like really stuck.

32:16.520 --> 32:20.680
 Mars is a whole new world of like, you know, territory fighting for, naming things and

32:20.680 --> 32:26.640
 you know, and it's a chance for new kind of governments maybe or maybe it's just the colonies

32:26.640 --> 32:27.640
 of these governments.

32:27.640 --> 32:28.640
 So we don't get that opportunity.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.880
 I think it'd be cool if there's new countries being, you know, totally new experiments.

32:31.880 --> 32:32.880
 Yeah.

32:32.880 --> 32:36.200
 And that's fascinating because Elon talks exactly about that and I believe that very

32:36.200 --> 32:43.360
 much like that should be like from, from the start, they should determine their own sovereignty.

32:43.360 --> 32:46.400
 Like they, they should determine their own thing.

32:46.400 --> 32:52.600
 There was one modern democracy in late 1700s, the U.S. I mean, it was the only, you know,

32:52.600 --> 32:57.680
 modern democracy and now of course that's, there's hundreds or dozen, many dozens.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.560
 But I think part of the reason that was able to start, I mean, it's not that people didn't

33:00.560 --> 33:01.560
 have the idea.

33:01.560 --> 33:02.560
 People had the idea.

33:02.560 --> 33:06.760
 But it was, they had a clean slate new place, you know, and they suddenly were, you know,

33:06.760 --> 33:10.880
 so I think it's, it would be a great opportunity to have, there's a lot of people have done

33:10.880 --> 33:15.080
 that, you know, oh, if I had my own government on an island, my own country, what would I

33:15.080 --> 33:16.080
 do?

33:16.080 --> 33:20.760
 And it's the, the U.S. founders actually had the opportunity, that fantasy, they were

33:20.760 --> 33:21.760
 like, we can do it.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.960
 Let's make, okay, what's the perfect country?

33:23.960 --> 33:25.640
 And they tried to make something.

33:25.640 --> 33:29.540
 Sometimes progress is, it's not held up by our imagination.

33:29.540 --> 33:34.760
 It's held up by just, there's no, you know, blank canvas to try something on.

33:34.760 --> 33:35.760
 Yeah.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.160
 It's an opportunity for a fresh start.

33:37.160 --> 33:40.760
 You know, the funny thing about the conversation we're having is not often had.

33:40.760 --> 33:46.120
 I mean, even by Elon, he's so focused on starship and actually putting the first human on Mars.

33:46.120 --> 33:51.720
 I think thinking about this kind of stuff is inspiring.

33:51.720 --> 33:54.320
 It makes us dream and makes us hope for the future.

33:54.320 --> 34:01.080
 So, and it makes us somehow like thinking about civilization on Mars is helping us think

34:01.080 --> 34:04.720
 about the civilization here on Earth, how we should run it.

34:04.720 --> 34:09.760
 Well, what do you think are, like in our lifetime, are we going to, I think any effort that goes

34:09.760 --> 34:12.880
 to Mars, the goal is in this decade.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.360
 Do you think that's actually going to be achieved?

34:15.360 --> 34:23.560
 I have a big bet, $10,000 with a friend when I was drunk in an argument that the Neil Armstrong

34:23.560 --> 34:28.760
 of Mars, whoever he or she may be, will set foot by the end of 2030.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.080
 Now this was probably in 2018 when I had this argument.

34:31.080 --> 34:32.080
 So like, what if...

34:32.080 --> 34:35.240
 So a human has to touch Mars by the end of 2030.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.240
 Oh, by the year 30.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.240
 Yeah.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.720
 By January 1st, 2031.

34:39.720 --> 34:40.720
 Yeah.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.720
 So...

34:41.720 --> 34:44.080
 Did you agree on the time zone or what?

34:44.080 --> 34:45.080
 No, no.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.080
 Yeah.

34:46.080 --> 34:49.000
 If it's coming on that exact day, that's going to be really stressful.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.240
 But anyway, I think that there will be.

34:52.240 --> 34:53.240
 That was 2018.

34:53.240 --> 34:54.880
 I was more confident then.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.240
 I think it's going to be around this time.

34:56.240 --> 35:00.000
 I mean, I still won the general bet because his point was, you are crazy, this is not

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
 going to happen in our lifetime.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.680
 They're not for many, many decades.

35:02.680 --> 35:03.680
 And I said, you're wrong.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.440
 You don't know what's going on in SpaceX.

35:05.440 --> 35:10.440
 I think if the world depended on it, I think probably SpaceX could probably...

35:10.440 --> 35:14.520
 I mean, I don't know this, but I think the tech is almost there.

35:14.520 --> 35:18.160
 Like, I don't think, of course, it's delayed many years by safety.

35:18.160 --> 35:22.040
 So they first want to send a ship around Mars and they want to land a cargo ship on Mars.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.400
 And there's the moon on the way too.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.400
 Yeah, yeah.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.400
 There's a lot.

35:25.400 --> 35:30.720
 But I think the moon a decade before seemed like magical tech that humans didn't have.

35:30.720 --> 35:38.920
 This is like, no, we can, it's totally conceivable that this, you've seen Starship, like it's

35:38.920 --> 35:44.000
 a interplanetary colonial or interplanetary transport like system.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.840
 That's what they used to call it.

35:45.840 --> 35:50.360
 SpaceX, the way they do it is, every time they do a launch, something fails usually,

35:50.360 --> 35:54.320
 you know, when they're testing and they learn a thousand things.

35:54.320 --> 35:59.720
 The amount of data they get and they improve, so each one has, you know, it's like they've

35:59.720 --> 36:02.320
 moved up like eight generations in each one anyway.

36:02.320 --> 36:06.680
 So it's not inconceivable that pretty soon they could send a Starship to Mars and land

36:06.680 --> 36:07.680
 it.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.680
 There's just no good reason.

36:08.680 --> 36:09.920
 I don't think that they couldn't do that.

36:09.920 --> 36:13.880
 And so if they could do that, they could in theory send a person to Mars pretty soon.

36:13.880 --> 36:18.200
 Now taking off from Mars and coming back again, I think, I don't think anyone want to be on

36:18.200 --> 36:21.720
 that voyage today because there's just, you know, they're still in, it's still amateur

36:21.720 --> 36:24.680
 hour here and getting that perfect.

36:24.680 --> 36:25.920
 I don't think we're too far away now.

36:25.920 --> 36:31.720
 The question is, so it's every, so every 26 months, Earth laps Mars, right?

36:31.720 --> 36:37.280
 It's like the sinusoidal, soil or orbit or whatever it's called, the period, 26 months.

36:37.280 --> 36:42.200
 So it's right now, like in the evens, like 2022 is going to have one of these 2020, late

36:42.200 --> 36:43.200
 2024.

36:43.200 --> 36:47.480
 So people could, this was the earliest estimate I heard Elon said, maybe we can send people

36:47.480 --> 36:51.920
 to Mars in 2024, you know, to land in 2020, early 2025.

36:51.920 --> 36:56.720
 That is not going to happen because that included 2022 sending a cargo ship to Mars.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.520
 Maybe even a one in 2020.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.240
 And so I think they're not quite on that schedule.

37:00.240 --> 37:05.600
 But to win my bet, 2027, I have a chance and 2029, I have another chance.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.720
 We're not very good at like backing up and seeing the big picture.

37:07.720 --> 37:10.960
 We're very distracted by what's going on today and what's, what we can believe because it's

37:10.960 --> 37:12.600
 happening in front of our face.

37:12.600 --> 37:16.360
 There's no way that a human is going to be landing on Mars and it's not going to be the

37:16.360 --> 37:18.640
 only thing everyone is talking about.

37:18.640 --> 37:19.640
 Right?

37:19.640 --> 37:21.440
 I mean, it's going to, it's going to be the moon landing, but even bigger deal going

37:21.440 --> 37:23.560
 to another planet, right?

37:23.560 --> 37:27.220
 And for it to start a colony, not just to, again, high five and come back.

37:27.220 --> 37:33.200
 So this is like the 2020s, maybe the 2030s is going to be the new 1960s.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.200
 We're going to have a space decade.

37:34.200 --> 37:38.520
 I'm so excited about, and it's again, it's one of the great leaps for all of life happening

37:38.520 --> 37:39.520
 in our lifetimes.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.520
 Like that's wild.

37:40.520 --> 37:46.680
 They paint a slightly cynical possibility, which I don't see happening, but I just want

37:46.680 --> 37:49.200
 to put sort of value into leadership.

37:49.200 --> 37:55.200
 I think it wasn't obvious that the moon landing would be so exciting for all of human civilization.

37:55.200 --> 38:00.840
 Some of that have to do with the right speeches, with the space race, like space, depending

38:00.840 --> 38:03.280
 on how it's presented, it could be boring.

38:03.280 --> 38:07.160
 I don't, I don't, I don't think it's been that so far, but I've actually,

38:07.160 --> 38:10.480
 I think space is quite boring right now.

38:10.480 --> 38:14.000
 And not, not, you know, SpaceX is super, but like 10 years ago, space.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.960
 Some writer, I forget who wrote, it's like the best magic trick in the show happened

38:17.960 --> 38:20.800
 at the beginning and now they're starting to do this like easy, you know, it's like

38:20.800 --> 38:21.800
 you can't go in that direction.

38:21.800 --> 38:27.320
 And the line that, that this writer said is like watching astronauts go up to the space

38:27.320 --> 38:31.920
 station after watching the moon is like watching Columbus sail to Ibiza.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.960
 It's just like, you know, it's, everything is so practical.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.800
 You're going up to the space station, not to explore, but to do science experiments

38:37.800 --> 38:42.320
 and microgravity and you're sending rockets up, you know, not, you know, mostly here and

38:42.320 --> 38:45.120
 there, there's a probe, but mostly you're sending them up to put satellites to, you

38:45.120 --> 38:48.640
 know, for, for direct TV, you know, and I or whatever it is.

38:48.640 --> 38:52.880
 It's kind of like lame earth industry, you know, usage.

38:52.880 --> 38:56.320
 So I agree with you, space is boring there.

38:56.320 --> 39:01.680
 The first human setting foot on Mars, that's got to be a crazy global event.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.680
 I can't imagine it not being, maybe you're right.

39:03.680 --> 39:06.240
 Maybe I'm taking for granted that the speeches and the space race and the,

39:06.240 --> 39:12.120
 I think the value of, I guess what I'm pushing is the value of people like Elon Musk and

39:12.120 --> 39:16.280
 potentially other leaders that hopefully step up is extremely important here.

39:16.280 --> 39:21.480
 Like I would argue without the publicity of SpaceX, it's not just the ingenuity of SpaceX,

39:21.480 --> 39:26.200
 but like what they've done publicly by having a, a figure that tweets and all that kind

39:26.200 --> 39:29.400
 of stuff like that, that, that's a source of inspiration.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.400
 Totally.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.880
 NASA wasn't able to quite pull off with a shuttle.

39:32.880 --> 39:35.280
 That's one of his two reasons for doing this.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.600
 SpaceX is just for two reasons.

39:37.600 --> 39:40.120
 One life insurance for the species.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.760
 If we're on, you know, if you're, if you're, I always think about this way, if you're

39:42.760 --> 39:47.520
 an alien on some far away planet and you're rooting against humanity and you win the bet

39:47.520 --> 39:51.600
 if humanity goes extinct, you do not like SpaceX.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.320
 You do not want them to have their eggs in two baskets now.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.320
 Yeah.

39:55.320 --> 39:58.920
 You know, it's, sure, it's like obviously this, you know, you could have some, you

39:58.920 --> 40:04.360
 know, something that kills everyone on both planets, some AI war or something, but, but

40:04.360 --> 40:08.200
 the point is obviously it's good for our chances, our long term chances to be having,

40:08.200 --> 40:11.360
 you know, choose to self sustaining civilizations going on.

40:11.360 --> 40:15.920
 The second reason he's seen, he's, he values this, I think just as high as it's the greatest

40:15.920 --> 40:20.360
 adventure in history, you know, going multi planetary and that, you know, it's, you know,

40:20.360 --> 40:24.640
 people need some reason to wake up in the morning and, and, and it'll, it'll just be

40:24.640 --> 40:26.200
 this hopefully great uniting event too.

40:26.200 --> 40:31.360
 I mean, I'm sure in today's nasty, awful political environment, which is like a whirlpool

40:31.360 --> 40:36.560
 of that sucks everything into it, so it doesn't mean you name a thing and it's become a nasty

40:36.560 --> 40:38.120
 political topic.

40:38.120 --> 40:44.920
 So I hope, I hope that space can, you know, Mars can just bring everyone together, but

40:44.920 --> 40:49.720
 you know, it could become this hideous thing where it's, you know, billionaire, some annoying

40:49.720 --> 40:50.720
 storyline gets built.

40:50.720 --> 40:54.760
 So half the people think that anyone who's excited about Mars is an evil, you know,

40:54.760 --> 40:55.760
 something.

40:55.760 --> 40:56.760
 Yeah.

40:56.760 --> 40:58.000
 Anyway, I hope it is super excited.

40:58.000 --> 41:04.920
 So far, space has been a uniting, inspiring thing and in fact, especially during this

41:04.920 --> 41:10.600
 time of a pandemic has been just a commercial entity putting out humans into space for the

41:10.600 --> 41:15.240
 first time was just one of the only big sources of hope.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.240
 Totally.

41:16.240 --> 41:20.680
 And aw, just like watching this huge skyscraper go up in the air, flip over, come back down

41:20.680 --> 41:21.680
 and land.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.960
 I mean, it just makes everyone just want to sit back and clap and kind of like, you know,

41:24.960 --> 41:30.360
 the way I look at something like SpaceX is it makes me proud to be a human.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.560
 And I think it makes a lot of people feel that way.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.400
 It's like good for our self esteem.

41:33.400 --> 41:36.000
 It's like, you know what, we're pretty, you know, we have a lot of problems, but like

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
 we're kind of awesome.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
 Yeah, we're awesome.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.440
 And if we can put people on Mars, you know, sticking up an Earth flag on Mars, like, damn,

41:42.440 --> 41:45.440
 you know, we should be so proud of our like little family here.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.440
 Like we did something cool.

41:46.440 --> 41:52.560
 And by the way, I've made it clear to SpaceX people, including Elon, many times.

41:52.560 --> 41:57.120
 And I just like, once a year reminder that if they want to make this more exciting, they

41:57.120 --> 42:02.360
 send the writer to Mars on, you know, I was on the thing and I'll blog about it.

42:02.360 --> 42:06.600
 So I'm just, you know, continuing to throw this out on which I'm trying to get them to

42:06.600 --> 42:07.600
 send me to Mars.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.600
 I understand that.

42:08.600 --> 42:12.320
 Um, so I just want to clarify on which trip does the writer want to go?

42:12.320 --> 42:16.880
 I think my dream one, to be honest, would be like the, you know, like the Apollo eight

42:16.880 --> 42:22.800
 where they just looped around the moon and came back because landing on Mars, um, give

42:22.800 --> 42:26.120
 you a lot of good content to write about great content, right?

42:26.120 --> 42:29.760
 I mean, the amount of kind of high minded, you know, and, and so I would go into the

42:29.760 --> 42:31.560
 thing and I would blog about it.

42:31.560 --> 42:35.400
 Uh, and I, and I, and I'd be in microgravity, so I'd be bouncing around my little space.

42:35.400 --> 42:36.920
 I get a little, they can just send me in a dragon.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.800
 I don't need to do a whole starship.

42:38.800 --> 42:42.920
 And um, and I would bounce around and I would get to, and I might, I've always had a dream

42:42.920 --> 42:48.400
 of going to like, uh, uh, one of those nice jails for a year because I've just had nothing

42:48.400 --> 42:51.520
 to do besides like read books and no responsibilities and no social plans.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.200
 So this is the ultimate version of that.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.320
 And anyway, it's a side topic, but I think it would be.

42:55.320 --> 43:00.120
 But also if you, I mean, to be honest, if you land on Mars, it's epic.

43:00.120 --> 43:05.840
 And then if you die there of like finishing your writing, it will be just even that much

43:05.840 --> 43:08.360
 more powerful for the, for the impact.

43:08.360 --> 43:09.360
 Yeah.

43:09.360 --> 43:12.440
 But then I'm gone and I don't even get to like experience the publication of it, which

43:12.440 --> 43:13.440
 is the whole point.

43:13.440 --> 43:17.600
 Well, some of the greatest writers in history didn't get a chance to experience the publication

43:17.600 --> 43:18.600
 of their.

43:18.600 --> 43:19.600
 I know.

43:19.600 --> 43:20.600
 I don't really think that.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.440
 I think like, I think back to Jesus and I'm like, oh man, that guy really like crushed

43:22.440 --> 43:23.440
 it, you know?

43:23.440 --> 43:28.600
 But then if you think about it, um, it doesn't like, you could literally die today and then

43:28.600 --> 43:32.960
 become the next Jesus like 2000 years from now in this civilization that's like, they're

43:32.960 --> 43:37.440
 you know, they're like in magical in the clouds and they're worshiping you.

43:37.440 --> 43:38.440
 They're worshiping Lex.

43:38.440 --> 43:41.920
 Like, and like that sounds like your ego probably would be like, wow, that's pretty cool, except

43:41.920 --> 43:44.280
 it irrelevant to you because you never even knew it happened.

43:44.280 --> 43:46.520
 This feels like a Rick and Morty episode.

43:46.520 --> 43:47.520
 It does.

43:47.520 --> 43:48.520
 It does.

43:48.520 --> 43:49.520
 Okay.

43:49.520 --> 43:51.840
 You've, uh, you've talked to Elon quite a bit.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.040
 You've written about him quite a bit.

43:54.040 --> 44:00.240
 Just it'd be cool to, to hear you talk about what are your ideas over what, you know, the

44:00.240 --> 44:06.160
 magic sauces you've written about, about with Elon, what, what makes him so successful?

44:06.160 --> 44:12.000
 His style of thinking, his ambition, his dreams, his, um, the people he connects with, the kind

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
 of problems he tackles.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.200
 Is there a kind of comments you can make about what makes him special?

44:16.200 --> 44:19.440
 I think that obviously there's a lot of things that he's very good at.

44:19.440 --> 44:23.360
 He has, um, he's, he has, he's obviously super intelligent.

44:23.360 --> 44:26.000
 His heart is very much in like, I think the right place.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.880
 Like, and you know, I really, really believe that like, and I think people can sense that.

44:29.880 --> 44:32.840
 You know, he just doesn't seem like a grifter of any kind.

44:32.840 --> 44:36.160
 He's truly trying to do these big things for the right reasons.

44:36.160 --> 44:38.400
 And he's obviously crazy ambitious and hardworking, right?

44:38.400 --> 44:39.400
 Not everyone is.

44:39.400 --> 44:42.320
 Some people are as talented and have cool visions, but they just don't want to spend their life

44:42.320 --> 44:43.320
 that way.

44:43.320 --> 44:47.880
 So, but that's none of those alone is what makes Elon, Elon.

44:47.880 --> 44:50.920
 I mean, if it were, there'd be more of him because there's a lot of people that are very

44:50.920 --> 44:54.520
 smart and smart enough to accumulate a lot of money and influence and they have great

44:54.520 --> 44:58.240
 ambition and they have, you know, their hearts in the right place.

44:58.240 --> 45:04.440
 Um, to me, it is of the very unusual quality he has is that he's sane in a way that almost

45:04.440 --> 45:06.440
 every human is crazy.

45:06.440 --> 45:16.400
 What I mean by that is we are programmed to trust conventional wisdom over our own reasoning,

45:16.400 --> 45:19.160
 um, for good reason.

45:19.160 --> 45:25.480
 If you go back 50,000 years, uh, and conventional wisdom says, you know, don't eat that berry,

45:25.480 --> 45:30.760
 you know, or this is the way you tie a, tie a spearhead to a spear, uh, and you're thinking,

45:30.760 --> 45:31.760
 I'm smarter than that.

45:31.760 --> 45:35.760
 Like you're not, you know, that, that, that comes from the accumulation of life experience,

45:35.760 --> 45:40.040
 accumulation of observation and experience over many generations.

45:40.040 --> 45:43.200
 And that's a little mini version of the collective super intelligence.

45:43.200 --> 45:49.640
 It's like, you know, it's equivalent of like making a pencil today, like, um, people back

45:49.640 --> 45:54.720
 then like the conventional wisdom, like had this super, this, this knowledge that no human

45:54.720 --> 45:56.200
 could ever accumulate.

45:56.200 --> 45:57.800
 So we're very wired to trust it.

45:57.800 --> 46:01.640
 Plus the secondary thing is that the people who, you know, just say that they believe

46:01.640 --> 46:04.240
 the mountain is, is they worship the mountain is their God, right?

46:04.240 --> 46:06.240
 And the guy in the mountain determines their fate.

46:06.240 --> 46:07.240
 That's not true.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.240
 Right.

46:08.240 --> 46:12.680
 And the conventional wisdom is wrong there, but, um, believing it was helpful to survival

46:12.680 --> 46:15.960
 because you were wanting, you, you, you were part of the crowd and you stayed in the tribe.

46:15.960 --> 46:20.560
 And if you started to, you know, you know, insult their, the mountain God and say, that's

46:20.560 --> 46:21.560
 just a mountain.

46:21.560 --> 46:23.360
 It's not, you know, you didn't fare very well, right?

46:23.360 --> 46:27.000
 So it was, for a lot of reasons, it was a great survival trait to just trust what other

46:27.000 --> 46:29.520
 people said, uh, and believe it.

46:29.520 --> 46:33.040
 And truly, you know, obviously, you know, the more you really believed it, the better

46:33.040 --> 46:42.480
 today, um, conventional wisdom in a rapidly changing world, um, and a huge giant society,

46:42.480 --> 46:45.920
 our brains are not built to understand that they have a few settings, you know, and none

46:45.920 --> 46:49.680
 of them is, uh, you know, 300 million person society.

46:49.680 --> 46:56.920
 So there, so your, your brain is basically, um, uh, is treating a lot of things like a

46:56.920 --> 47:00.200
 small tribe, even though they're not, and they're, and, and they're treating conventional

47:00.200 --> 47:04.280
 wisdom as, as, you know, very wise in a way that it's not, if you think about it this

47:04.280 --> 47:09.040
 way, it's like picture a, like a bucket that's not moving very much, very moving like a millimeter

47:09.040 --> 47:10.040
 a year.

47:10.040 --> 47:11.320
 And so it has time to collect a lot of water in it.

47:11.320 --> 47:13.680
 That's like conventional wisdom in the old days when very few things change.

47:13.680 --> 47:16.280
 Like you're, you're 10, you know, a great, great, great grandmother probably lived a

47:16.280 --> 47:19.360
 similar life to you, maybe on the same piece of land.

47:19.360 --> 47:21.560
 And so old people really knew what they were talking about today.

47:21.560 --> 47:23.460
 The bucket's moving really quickly.

47:23.460 --> 47:27.200
 And so, you know, the wisdom doesn't accumulate, but we think it does because our brain settings

47:27.200 --> 47:31.560
 doesn't have the, oh, move, you know, quickly moving bucket, uh, setting on it.

47:31.560 --> 47:38.560
 So, um, my grandmother gives me advice all the time and I have to decide is this.

47:38.560 --> 47:42.840
 So there are certain things that are not changing, like relationships and love and loyalty and

47:42.840 --> 47:44.120
 things like this.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.880
 Her advice on those things, I'll listen to it all day.

47:45.880 --> 47:48.920
 She's one of the people who said, you've got to live near your people you love, live near

47:48.920 --> 47:49.920
 your family.

47:49.920 --> 47:50.920
 Right.

47:50.920 --> 47:52.960
 I think that is like tremendous wisdom, right?

47:52.960 --> 47:53.960
 That is wisdom.

47:53.960 --> 47:56.800
 Because that happens to be something that hasn't, doesn't change from generation to generation.

47:56.800 --> 47:57.800
 For now.

47:57.800 --> 47:58.800
 Right.

47:58.800 --> 47:59.800
 She all, right.

47:59.800 --> 48:00.800
 For now.

48:00.800 --> 48:01.800
 She's also telling, right.

48:01.800 --> 48:02.800
 So I'll be the idiot telling my brain like that.

48:02.800 --> 48:05.800
 And they'll actually be in the, it's a metaverse, like being like, it doesn't matter.

48:05.800 --> 48:08.200
 And I'm like, you have to, it's not the same when you're not in person.

48:08.200 --> 48:09.200
 They're going to say it.

48:09.200 --> 48:10.200
 It's exactly the same.

48:10.200 --> 48:13.400
 And they'll also be thinking to me with their nearer link and I'm going to be like, slow

48:13.400 --> 48:14.400
 down.

48:14.400 --> 48:15.400
 I don't understand what you're saying.

48:15.400 --> 48:17.400
 You just talk like a normal person.

48:17.400 --> 48:18.400
 Anyway.

48:18.400 --> 48:20.800
 You're like my grandmother then, but then she says, you know, you're, I don't know about

48:20.800 --> 48:21.800
 this writing you're doing.

48:21.800 --> 48:25.440
 You should go to law school and, you know, you know, you want to be secure.

48:25.440 --> 48:26.880
 And that's not good advice for me.

48:26.880 --> 48:30.920
 You know, given the world I'm in and what I like to do and what I'm good at, that's

48:30.920 --> 48:34.800
 not the right advice, but because the world is totally, she's in a different world.

48:34.800 --> 48:37.080
 So she became wise for a world that's no longer here.

48:37.080 --> 48:38.080
 Right.

48:38.080 --> 48:40.760
 Now, if you think about that, so then when we think about conventional wisdom, it's a

48:40.760 --> 48:42.280
 little like my grandmother.

48:42.280 --> 48:47.400
 And there's a lot of, no, it's not maybe, you know, 60 years outdated, like her software.

48:47.400 --> 48:51.640
 This may be 10 years outdated conventional wisdom, sometimes 20.

48:51.640 --> 48:58.520
 So anyway, I think that we all continually don't have the confidence in our own reasoning

48:58.520 --> 49:02.840
 when it conflicts with what everyone else thinks, when with what seems right.

49:02.840 --> 49:07.120
 We don't have the, the guts to act on that reasoning for that reason, right?

49:07.120 --> 49:12.520
 You know, we, we, we, and so there's so many Elon examples, I mean, just from the beginning,

49:12.520 --> 49:20.640
 Zip2 was the first company and it was internet advertising at the time when people said, you

49:20.640 --> 49:23.880
 know, this internet was brand new, like kind of like, kind of thinking of like the metaverse

49:23.880 --> 49:24.880
 VR metaverse today.

49:24.880 --> 49:28.560
 And people have been like, oh, we're saying, you know, we, you know, we facilitate internet

49:28.560 --> 49:29.560
 advertising.

49:29.560 --> 49:31.320
 People are saying, yeah, people are going to advertise on the internet.

49:31.320 --> 49:32.320
 Yeah, right.

49:32.320 --> 49:36.400
 But actually it wasn't that he's magical and saw the future is that he looked at the present,

49:36.400 --> 49:41.840
 looked at what the internet was, thought about, you know, the obvious like advertising

49:41.840 --> 49:42.840
 opportunity.

49:42.840 --> 49:45.280
 This was going to be, it wasn't rocket science.

49:45.280 --> 49:46.280
 It wasn't genius.

49:46.280 --> 49:47.280
 I don't believe.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.160
 I think it was just seeing the truth.

49:49.160 --> 49:51.520
 And when everyone else is laughing saying, well, you're, you're wrong.

49:51.520 --> 49:55.000
 I mean, I did the math and here it is, right?

49:55.000 --> 49:59.840
 Next company, you know, x.com, which became eventually PayPal.

49:59.840 --> 50:02.880
 People said, oh yeah, people are going to put their financial information on the internet.

50:02.880 --> 50:03.960
 No way.

50:03.960 --> 50:06.080
 To us, it seems so obvious.

50:06.080 --> 50:08.840
 If you went back then, you would probably feel the same way you think this is that is

50:08.840 --> 50:12.960
 a, that is a fake company that no, it's just obviously not a good idea.

50:12.960 --> 50:14.480
 He looked around and said, you know, I see where this is.

50:14.480 --> 50:17.360
 And so again, he could see where it was going because he could see what it was that day.

50:17.360 --> 50:22.080
 And not what it, you know, not people, conventional wisdom was still a bunch of years earlier.

50:22.080 --> 50:24.080
 SpaceX is the ultimate example.

50:24.080 --> 50:28.720
 A friend of his apparently bought, actually compiled a montage, video montage of rockets

50:28.720 --> 50:32.320
 blowing up to show him this is not a good idea.

50:32.320 --> 50:36.160
 And if, but just even the bigger picture, the amount of billionaires who have like thought

50:36.160 --> 50:40.360
 this was, I'm going to start launching rockets and, you know, the amount to failed.

50:40.360 --> 50:44.600
 I mean, it's not, conventional wisdom said this isn't a bad endeavor.

50:44.600 --> 50:49.240
 He was putting all of his money into landing rockets was another thing.

50:49.240 --> 50:54.720
 You know, well, here's the classic kind of way we are, we reason, which is if this could

50:54.720 --> 50:58.720
 be done, NASA would have done it a long time ago because of the money it would save.

50:58.720 --> 50:59.720
 This could be done.

50:59.720 --> 51:02.040
 The Soviet Union would have done it back in the sixties.

51:02.040 --> 51:03.840
 It's obviously something that can't be done.

51:03.840 --> 51:07.280
 And the math on his envelope said, well, I think it can be done.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.280
 And so he just did it.

51:08.280 --> 51:11.440
 So in each of these cases, I think actually in some ways he long gets too much credit

51:11.440 --> 51:15.360
 as, you know, people think it's, it's that he's, you know, it's that his Einstein intelligence

51:15.360 --> 51:16.760
 or his, he can see the future.

51:16.760 --> 51:19.640
 He has incredible, he has incredible guts.

51:19.640 --> 51:20.640
 He's so courageous.

51:20.640 --> 51:26.960
 I think if you actually are looking at reality and you're just assessing probabilities and

51:26.960 --> 51:29.320
 you're ignoring all the noise, which is wrong.

51:29.320 --> 51:30.320
 So wrong.

51:30.320 --> 51:31.320
 Right.

51:31.320 --> 51:36.680
 And then you just have to be, you know, pretty smart and, you know, pretty courageous.

51:36.680 --> 51:41.840
 And you have to have this magical ability to be sane and trust your reasoning over conventional

51:41.840 --> 51:45.960
 wisdom because your individual reasoning, you know, part of it is that we see that we

51:45.960 --> 51:46.960
 can't build a pencil.

51:46.960 --> 51:49.960
 We can't build, you know, the civilization on our own, right?

51:49.960 --> 51:56.560
 So we kind of count, you know, to the, to the collective, for good reason, but this

51:56.560 --> 52:00.080
 is different when it comes to kind of what's possible, you know, the Beatles were doing

52:00.080 --> 52:05.400
 their kind of Motowney chord patterns in the early sixties and they were doing what was

52:05.400 --> 52:06.400
 normal.

52:06.400 --> 52:09.000
 They were doing what was clearly this kind of sound is a hit.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.520
 Then they started getting weird because they had, they were so popular.

52:11.520 --> 52:15.400
 They had this confidence to say, let's just, we're going to start just experimenting.

52:15.400 --> 52:19.160
 And it turns out that like, if you're just, all these people are in this like one groove

52:19.160 --> 52:23.440
 together doing music and it's just like, there's a lot of land over there.

52:23.440 --> 52:27.160
 And it seems like, you know, I'm sure the managers would say, and that the, all the

52:27.160 --> 52:29.120
 record execs would say, no, you have to be here.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.520
 This is what sells.

52:30.520 --> 52:32.040
 And it's just not true.

52:32.040 --> 52:37.320
 So I think that Elon is why the term for this that actually Elon likes to use is reasoning

52:37.320 --> 52:40.120
 from first principles, the physics term.

52:40.120 --> 52:42.360
 First principles are your axioms and physicists.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.960
 They don't say, well, what's, you know, what, what, what do people think?

52:44.960 --> 52:46.400
 No, they say, what are the axioms?

52:46.400 --> 52:47.400
 Those are the puzzle pieces.

52:47.400 --> 52:49.440
 Let's use those to build a conclusion.

52:49.440 --> 52:50.440
 That's our hypothesis.

52:50.440 --> 52:51.440
 Now let's test it.

52:51.440 --> 52:52.440
 Right.

52:52.440 --> 52:55.320
 And they come up with all kinds of new things constantly by doing that.

52:55.320 --> 52:58.320
 If Einstein was assuming conventional wisdom was right, he never would have even tried

52:58.320 --> 53:02.440
 to create something that really disproved Newton's laws.

53:02.440 --> 53:08.520
 And the other way to reason is reasoning by analogy, which is a great shortcut.

53:08.520 --> 53:12.160
 It's when we look at other people's reasoning and we kind of photocopy it into our head,

53:12.160 --> 53:13.360
 we steal it.

53:13.360 --> 53:16.000
 So reasoning by analogy, we do all the time.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
 And it's usually a good thing.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.160
 I mean, we don't, if you, it takes a lot of mental energy and time to reason from first

53:20.160 --> 53:21.160
 principles.

53:21.160 --> 53:23.320
 It's actually, you know, you don't want to reinvent the wheel every time, right?

53:23.320 --> 53:27.120
 You want to often copy other people's reasoning most of the time.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.600
 And not, you know, most of us do it most of the time and that's good, but there's certain

53:29.600 --> 53:33.480
 moments when you're forget just for a second, like succeeding in like the world of like

53:33.480 --> 53:36.640
 Elon, just who you're going to marry, where are you going to settle down?

53:36.640 --> 53:38.920
 How are you going to raise your kids?

53:38.920 --> 53:41.080
 How are you going to educate your kids?

53:41.080 --> 53:42.280
 How you should educate yourself?

53:42.280 --> 53:44.600
 What kind of career paths in terms of these moments?

53:44.600 --> 53:48.440
 This is what on your deathbed, like you look back on and that's what these are the few

53:48.440 --> 53:50.760
 number of choices that really define your life.

53:50.760 --> 53:52.520
 Those should not be reasoned by analogy.

53:52.520 --> 53:55.440
 You should absolutely try to reason from first principles.

53:55.440 --> 53:59.280
 And Elon, not just by the way in his work, but in his personal life.

53:59.280 --> 54:02.880
 I mean, if you just look at the way he's on Twitter, it's not how you're supposed to

54:02.880 --> 54:07.680
 be when you're a super famous, you know, you know, industry titan, you're not supposed

54:07.680 --> 54:11.880
 to just be silly on Twitter and do memes and getting little quibbles with you.

54:11.880 --> 54:16.320
 He just does things his own way, regardless of what you're supposed to do, which sometimes

54:16.320 --> 54:17.840
 serves him and sometimes doesn't.

54:17.840 --> 54:21.640
 But I think it has taken him where it has taken me.

54:21.640 --> 54:26.320
 I mean, I probably wouldn't describe his approach to Twitter as first principles, but I guess

54:26.320 --> 54:27.320
 that's the same.

54:27.320 --> 54:28.320
 I think it is.

54:28.320 --> 54:31.040
 Well, first of all, I will say that a lot of tweets, people think, oh, like he's going

54:31.040 --> 54:32.640
 to be done after that.

54:32.640 --> 54:33.640
 He's fine.

54:33.640 --> 54:35.480
 He's on, you know, he's just one man, time man of the year.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.520
 Like it's something, it's not sinking him.

54:38.520 --> 54:41.680
 And I think, you know, it's not that I think this is like super reasoned out.

54:41.680 --> 54:43.560
 I think that, you know, Twitter is his silly side.

54:43.560 --> 54:50.920
 But I think that he saw, his reasoning did not feel like there was a giant risk in just

54:50.920 --> 54:54.120
 being his silly self on Twitter when a lot of billionaires would say, well, no one else

54:54.120 --> 54:55.620
 is doing that.

54:55.620 --> 54:57.800
 So it must be a good reason, right?

54:57.800 --> 55:04.520
 Well, I got to say that he inspires me to, that's okay to be silly on Twitter.

55:04.520 --> 55:06.680
 And but yeah, you're right.

55:06.680 --> 55:10.560
 The big inspiration is the willingness to do that when nobody else is doing it.

55:10.560 --> 55:11.560
 Yeah.

55:11.560 --> 55:16.280
 And I think about all the great artists, you know, all the great inventors and entrepreneurs,

55:16.280 --> 55:19.440
 almost all of them, they had a moment when they trusted their reason.

55:19.440 --> 55:24.880
 I mean, Airbnb was over 60 with VCs.

55:24.880 --> 55:29.000
 A lot of people would say, obviously they know something we don't, right?

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
 But they didn't.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
 They said, eh, I think they're all wrong.

55:31.000 --> 55:34.360
 I mean, that's, that takes some kind of different wiring in your brain.

55:34.360 --> 55:39.800
 And then that's both for big picture and detailed like engineering problems.

55:39.800 --> 55:40.800
 It's fun to talk to him.

55:40.800 --> 55:45.080
 It's fun to talk Jim Keller, who's a good example of this kind of thinking about like

55:45.080 --> 55:47.600
 manufacturing, how to get cost down.

55:47.600 --> 55:52.240
 They always talk about like, they talk about SpaceX rockets this way.

55:52.240 --> 56:01.120
 They talk about manufacturing this way, like cost per pound or per ton to get to orbit

56:01.120 --> 56:02.120
 or something like that.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.120
 Yeah.

56:03.120 --> 56:04.680
 This is the other reason we need to get the cost down.

56:04.680 --> 56:07.240
 It's a very kind of raw materials.

56:07.240 --> 56:08.240
 Yeah.

56:08.240 --> 56:10.480
 Like just very basic way of thinking.

56:10.480 --> 56:11.480
 First principles.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.480
 It's really.

56:12.480 --> 56:13.480
 Yeah.

56:13.480 --> 56:18.960
 The principles of rocket are like the price of raw materials and gravity, you know, and

56:18.960 --> 56:19.960
 wind.

56:19.960 --> 56:24.760
 I mean, these are your first principles and fuel.

56:24.760 --> 56:31.600
 Henry Ford, you know, what made Henry Ford blow up as an entrepreneur assembly line,

56:31.600 --> 56:32.600
 right?

56:32.600 --> 56:37.880
 I mean, he thought for a second and said, this isn't how manufacturing is normally done

56:37.880 --> 56:38.880
 this way.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.800
 But I think this is a different kind of product.

56:40.800 --> 56:41.800
 And that's what changed it.

56:41.800 --> 56:44.560
 You know, and then what happened is when someone reasons from first principles, they

56:44.560 --> 56:45.560
 often fail.

56:45.560 --> 56:49.400
 You know, you're going out into the fog with no conventional wisdom to guide you.

56:49.400 --> 56:52.640
 But when you succeed, what you notice is that everyone else turns and says, wait, what,

56:52.640 --> 56:53.640
 what are they doing?

56:53.640 --> 56:54.640
 What are they all?

56:54.640 --> 56:55.640
 They flock over.

56:55.640 --> 56:56.640
 Look at the iPhone.

56:56.640 --> 57:00.040
 iPhone, you know, Steve Jobs was obviously famously good at reasoning from first principles

57:00.040 --> 57:02.920
 because that guy had crazy self confidence.

57:02.920 --> 57:05.960
 He just said, you know, if I think this is right, like everyone and that, I mean, I don't

57:05.960 --> 57:07.560
 know how, I don't know how he does that.

57:07.560 --> 57:09.560
 And, and I don't think Apple can do that anymore.

57:09.560 --> 57:10.560
 I mean, they lost that.

57:10.560 --> 57:14.920
 And that one brain, his ability to do that was made of that in a totally different company,

57:14.920 --> 57:17.360
 even though there's tens of thousands of people there.

57:17.360 --> 57:21.960
 He said, he didn't say, you know, I'm giving a lot of credit to Steve Jobs, but of course

57:21.960 --> 57:26.360
 it was a team at Apple who said they didn't look at the flip phones and, and say, okay,

57:26.360 --> 57:29.280
 what kind of, you know, let's make a, you know, keyboard that's like clicky and, you

57:29.280 --> 57:30.280
 know, really cool Apple keyboard.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.760
 They said, what should a mobile device be?

57:32.760 --> 57:35.760
 You know, what the axioms, what are the axioms here?

57:35.760 --> 57:37.200
 And none of them involved the keyboard necessarily.

57:37.200 --> 57:39.120
 And by the time they piece it up, there was no keyboard.

57:39.120 --> 57:40.600
 It didn't make sense.

57:40.600 --> 57:41.600
 Everyone suddenly is going, wait, what?

57:41.600 --> 57:42.600
 What are they doing?

57:42.600 --> 57:43.600
 What are they doing?

57:43.600 --> 57:44.600
 And now every phone looks like the iPhone.

57:44.600 --> 57:46.880
 I mean, that's, that's how it goes.

57:46.880 --> 57:51.520
 You tweeted, what's something you've changed your mind about?

57:51.520 --> 57:53.520
 That's the question you've tweeted.

57:53.520 --> 57:58.120
 Elon replied, brain transplants, Sam Harris responded, nuclear power.

57:58.120 --> 58:01.560
 There's a bunch of people with cool responses there.

58:01.560 --> 58:05.080
 In general, what are your thoughts about some of the responses and what have you changed

58:05.080 --> 58:07.800
 your mind about, big or small?

58:07.800 --> 58:10.660
 What's in doing the research for some of your writing?

58:10.660 --> 58:17.400
 So I'm writing right now, just finishing a book on kind of why our society is such

58:17.400 --> 58:20.240
 a shit place at the moment, just polarized.

58:20.240 --> 58:23.520
 And, you know, we have all these gifts like we're talking about, just the supermarket,

58:23.520 --> 58:28.080
 you know, we have these, this exploding technology, fewer and fewer people are in poverty.

58:28.080 --> 58:31.400
 You know, it's, it's Louis C.K., you know, likes to say, you know, everything's amazing

58:31.400 --> 58:32.400
 and no one's happy, right?

58:32.400 --> 58:36.920
 And, but, but, but it's really extreme moment right now where it's like, hate is on the

58:36.920 --> 58:37.920
 rise.

58:37.920 --> 58:38.920
 Like crazy things, right?

58:38.920 --> 58:43.320
 And if I could interrupt briefly, you did tweet that you just wrote the last word.

58:43.320 --> 58:44.440
 I sure did.

58:44.440 --> 58:49.080
 And then there's some hilarious asshole who said, now you just have to work on all the

58:49.080 --> 58:50.080
 ones in the middle.

58:50.080 --> 58:51.080
 Yeah, I've heard that.

58:51.080 --> 58:55.840
 I mean, when, when you, when you earn a reputation as a, as a tried and true procrastinator, you're

58:55.840 --> 58:57.920
 just going to get shit forever.

58:57.920 --> 58:58.920
 And that's fine.

58:58.920 --> 58:59.920
 I accept my fate there.

58:59.920 --> 59:03.920
 So do you mind sharing a little bit more about the details of what you're writing?

59:03.920 --> 59:06.880
 So you're, what, what, how do you approach that?

59:06.880 --> 59:09.200
 Do you approach this question about the state of society?

59:09.200 --> 59:15.120
 I wanted to figure out what was going on because what I noticed was a bad trend.

59:15.120 --> 59:16.520
 It's not that, you know, things are bad.

59:16.520 --> 59:20.000
 It's that things are getting worse in certain ways, not in every way.

59:20.000 --> 59:25.080
 And if you look at Max Rosar stuff, you know, he comes up with all these amazing graphs.

59:25.080 --> 59:29.040
 This is what's weird is that things are getting better in almost every important metric you

59:29.040 --> 59:36.600
 can think of, except the amount of people who hate other people in their own country

59:36.600 --> 59:40.960
 and the amount of people that hate their own country, that the amount of Americans that

59:40.960 --> 59:42.840
 hate America is on the rise, right?

59:42.840 --> 59:47.200
 The amount of Americans that hate other Americans is on the rise.

59:47.200 --> 59:50.440
 The amount of Americans that hate the president is on the rise, all these things, like on

59:50.440 --> 59:52.960
 the very steep rise.

59:52.960 --> 59:53.960
 So what the hell?

59:53.960 --> 59:54.960
 What's going on?

59:54.960 --> 59:56.200
 Like there's something, there's something causing that.

59:56.200 --> 59:59.400
 It's not that, you know, a bunch of new people were born who were just dicks.

59:59.400 --> 1:00:01.320
 It's that something is going on.

1:00:01.320 --> 1:00:08.000
 So I think of it as a very simple, oversimplified equation, human behavior.

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:13.200
 And it's the output that I think the two inputs are human nature and environment, right?

1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:18.480
 This is basic, you know, super, super kindergarten level, like, you know, animal behavior.

1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:20.160
 But I think it's worth thinking about.

1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:24.480
 You've got human nature, which is not changing very much, right?

1:00:24.480 --> 1:00:29.800
 And then you got, you throw that nature into a certain environment and it reacts to the

1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:31.280
 environment, right?

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:32.560
 It's shaped by the environment.

1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:36.680
 And then eventually what comes out is behavior, right?

1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:40.320
 Human nature is not changing very much, but suddenly we're behaving differently, right?

1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:42.640
 We are, again, you know, look at the polls.

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:46.720
 Like it used to be that the president, you know, was liked by, I don't remember the exact

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:52.600
 numbers, but, you know, 80% or 70% of their own party and, you know, 50% of the other

1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:53.600
 party.

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:57.640
 And now it's like 40% of their own party and 10% of the other party, you know?

1:00:57.640 --> 1:01:00.280
 And it's not that the presidents are getting worse and maybe some people would argue that

1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:02.360
 they are, but more so.

1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:06.840
 There's a lot of, you know, idiot presidents throughout the, what's going on is something

1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:11.600
 in the environment is changing and that's, that you're seeing as a change in behavior.

1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:16.880
 Easy example here is that, you know, by a lot of metrics, racism is getting, is becoming

1:01:16.880 --> 1:01:19.200
 less and less of a problem.

1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:23.000
 You know, it's hard to measure, but there's metrics like, you know, how upset would you

1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:28.400
 be if your kid married someone of another race and that number is plummeting, but racial

1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:30.960
 grievance is skyrocketing, right?

1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:32.080
 There's a lot of examples like this.

1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:35.320
 So I wanted to look around and say, and the reason I took it on, the reason I don't think

1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:39.200
 this is just an unfortunate trend, unpleasant trend that hopefully we come out of is that

1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:42.000
 all this other stuff I like to write about, all this future stuff, right?

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:43.000
 And is this magical?

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.320
 I always think of this, I'm very optimistic in a lot of ways.

1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:50.960
 And I think that our world would be a utopia, would seem like actual heaven, like whatever

1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:53.800
 Thomas Jefferson was picturing as heaven.

1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:58.400
 Other than maybe the eternal life aspect, I think that if he came to 2021 US, it would

1:01:58.400 --> 1:01:59.400
 be better.

1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:01.000
 It's cooler than heaven.

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.800
 What we live in a place that's cooler than 1700s heaven, again, other than the fact that

1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:05.800
 we still die.

1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:09.600
 Now, I think that future world actually probably would have a quote, eternal life.

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:13.680
 I don't think anyone wants to turn to life actually, if people think they do, eternal

1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:14.680
 is a long time.

1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:18.400
 But I think the true, the choice to die when you want, maybe we're uploaded, maybe, maybe

1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:19.400
 we can refresh our bodies.

1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:20.400
 I don't know what it is.

1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:23.840
 But the point is, I think about that utopia.

1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:27.280
 And I do believe that if we don't botch this, we'd be heading towards somewhere that would

1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:30.120
 seem like heaven, maybe in our lifetimes.

1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:35.080
 Of course, if things go wrong, now think about the trends here.

1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:39.240
 Just like the 20th century would seem like some magical utopia to someone from the 16th

1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:46.400
 century, the bad things in the 20th century were kind of the worst things ever in terms

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:48.160
 of just absolute magnitude.

1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:52.120
 World War II, the biggest genocides ever.

1:02:52.120 --> 1:02:57.840
 You've got maybe climate change, if it is the existential threat that many people think

1:02:57.840 --> 1:02:58.840
 it is.

1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:01.120
 I mean, we never had an existential threat on that level before.

1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:04.120
 So the good is getting better and the bad is getting worse.

1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:09.960
 And so what I think about the future, I think of us as some kind of big, long canoe as a

1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:15.960
 species, 5 million mile long canoe, each of us sitting in a row, and we each have one

1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:18.680
 or we can paddle on the left side or the right side.

1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:22.280
 And what we know is there's a fork up there somewhere.

1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:27.200
 And at the river forks, and there's a utopia on one side and a dystopia on the other side.

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:30.520
 And I really believe that we're probably not headed for just an okay future.

1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:33.480
 It's just the way tech is exploding, like it's probably going to be really good or really

1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:34.480
 bad.

1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:35.800
 The question is, which side should we be rowing on?

1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:37.840
 We can't see up there, right?

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:38.840
 But it really matters.

1:03:38.840 --> 1:03:40.760
 So I'm running about this future stuff and I'm saying none of this matters if we're

1:03:40.760 --> 1:03:44.520
 squabbling our way into kind of like a civil war right now.

1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:45.520
 So what's going on?

1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:49.080
 So it's a really important problem to solve.

1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:51.920
 What are your sources of hope in this?

1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:55.120
 So like, how do you steer the canoe?

1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:58.440
 One of my big sources of hope, and this is my putting my answer to what I changed my

1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:03.840
 mind on, is I think I always knew this, but it's easy to forget it.

1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:09.200
 Our primitive brain does not remember this fact, which is that I don't think there are

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:10.640
 very many bad people.

1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:13.800
 Now, you say bad, you know, are there selfish people?

1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:21.720
 Most of us, I think if you think of people, there's digital languages, ones and zeros.

1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:25.000
 And our primitive brain very quickly can get into the land where everyone's a one or a

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.000
 zero.

1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:27.000
 Our tribe, we're all ones.

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:28.000
 We're perfect.

1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:29.000
 I'm perfect.

1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:30.000
 My family is that other family.

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.000
 It's that other tribe.

1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:32.000
 There are zeros.

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:33.000
 And you dehumanize them, right?

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.000
 These people are awful.

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.240
 So zero is not a human place.

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:37.240
 No one's a zero.

1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:38.240
 And no one's a one.

1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:39.320
 You're dehumanizing yourself.

1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:44.080
 So when we get into this land, I call it political Disney world because in Disney movies, good

1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:48.680
 guys have, you know, scar is totally bad and Mufasa is totally good, right?

1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:52.360
 You don't see Mufasa's character flaws and you don't see Scar's upbringing that made

1:04:52.360 --> 1:04:53.360
 him like that.

1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:54.360
 That humanizes him.

1:04:54.360 --> 1:04:55.360
 No, lionizes him.

1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:56.360
 Whatever.

1:04:56.360 --> 1:04:57.360
 You are.

1:04:57.360 --> 1:04:58.360
 Well done.

1:04:58.360 --> 1:04:59.360
 Yeah.

1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:00.680
 Mufasa's a one and Scar's a zero.

1:05:00.680 --> 1:05:01.680
 Very simple.

1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:02.680
 Yeah.

1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:07.160
 So political Disney world is a place, a psychological place that all of us have been in and it can

1:05:07.160 --> 1:05:11.160
 be religious Disney world, it can be national Disney world and the war, whatever it is.

1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:14.840
 But it's a place where we fall into this delusion that there are protagonists and antagonists

1:05:14.840 --> 1:05:15.840
 and that's it, right?

1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:17.040
 That is not true.

1:05:17.040 --> 1:05:21.000
 We are all 0.5s or maybe 0.6s to 0.4s in that.

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.440
 We are also, on one hand, it's not, I don't think there's that many really great people,

1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:25.440
 frankly.

1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:28.280
 I think if you get into it, people are kind of a lot of people, you know, most of us

1:05:28.280 --> 1:05:31.680
 have, you know, if you get really into our most shameful memories, the things we've done

1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:35.000
 that are worse, the most shameful thoughts, the deep selfishness that some of us have

1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.120
 in areas we wouldn't want to admit, right?

1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:40.600
 Most of us have a lot of unadmirable stuff, right?

1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:44.440
 On the other hand, if you actually got into, really got into someone else's brain and you

1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:47.240
 looked at their upbringing, you looked at the trauma that they've experienced and then

1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:51.240
 you looked at the insecurities they have and you look at all their, if you assemble the

1:05:51.240 --> 1:05:55.840
 highlight reel of your worst moments, the meanest things you've ever done, the worst

1:05:55.840 --> 1:05:58.560
 days, most selfish, the times, you know, you stole something, whatever.

1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:00.720
 And you just, people were like, wow, Lex is an awful person.

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:03.960
 If you highlighted your, if you did a montage of your best moments, people would say, oh,

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:04.960
 he's a god, right?

1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:06.880
 But of course we all have both of those.

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:13.800
 So I've started to really try to remind myself that everyone's a 0.5, right?

1:06:13.800 --> 1:06:18.040
 And 0.5s are all worthy of criticism and we're all worthy of compassion.

1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:22.720
 And the thing that makes me hopeful is that I really think that there's a bunch of 0.5s

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:26.400
 and 0.5s are good enough that we should be able to create a good society together.

1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:28.360
 There's a lot of love in every human.

1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:30.360
 And I think there's more love in humans than hate.

1:06:30.360 --> 1:06:34.400
 You know, I always remember this moment.

1:06:34.400 --> 1:06:38.120
 This is weird anecdote, but I was at, I'm a Red Sox fan, Boston Red Sox baseball and

1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:40.560
 Derek Jeter is who we hate the most.

1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:41.560
 He's on the Yankees.

1:06:41.560 --> 1:06:42.560
 Yes.

1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:43.560
 And hate, right?

1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:44.560
 Jeter, right?

1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:49.800
 He was his last game in Fenway, he's retiring and he got this rousing standing ovation and

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:52.480
 I almost cried and it was like, what is going on?

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:55.560
 We hate this guy, but actually there's so much love in all humans.

1:06:55.560 --> 1:06:59.160
 You know, it felt so good to just give a huge cheer to this guy.

1:06:59.160 --> 1:07:02.560
 We hate because it's like this moment of like a little fist pound being like, of course

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:04.280
 we all actually love each other.

1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:06.280
 And I think there's so much of that.

1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:09.640
 And so the thing that I think I've come around on is I just, I don't, I think that we are

1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:13.240
 in an environment that's bringing out really bad stuff.

1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:16.720
 I don't think it's, if I thought it was the people, I would be more hopeful.

1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:19.840
 Like if I thought it was human nature, I'd be, you know, be more upset.

1:07:19.840 --> 1:07:25.160
 It's the two independent variables here, or there's a fixed variable, there's a constant,

1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:26.160
 which is human nature.

1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:30.440
 And there's the independent variable environment and the behavior is the dependent variable.

1:07:30.440 --> 1:07:34.600
 I like that the thing that I think is bad is the independent variable, the environment,

1:07:34.600 --> 1:07:36.760
 which means I think we can, the environment can get better.

1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:39.920
 And there's a lot of things I can go into about why the environment I think is bad.

1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:44.600
 But I have hope because I think the thing that's bad for us is something that can change.

1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:51.760
 The first principles idea here is that most people have the capacity to be a 0.70 to 0.9

1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:57.920
 if the environment is properly calibrated with the right incentives.

1:07:57.920 --> 1:08:01.640
 I think that, well, I think that, I think maybe if we're all, yeah, if we're all 0.5s,

1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:05.320
 I think that environments can bring out our good side.

1:08:05.320 --> 1:08:10.560
 You know, yes, if maybe we're all on some kind of distribution and the right environment

1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:12.800
 can, yes, can bring out our higher sides.

1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:17.760
 And I think a lot of, in a lot of ways, you could say it has, I mean, the U.S. environment,

1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:23.960
 we take for granted how the liberal laws and liberal environment that we live in, I mean,

1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:26.320
 like, in New York City, right?

1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:30.360
 If you walk down the street and you like assault someone, hey, if anyone sees you, they're

1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:31.360
 probably going to yell at you.

1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:33.000
 You might get your ass kicked by someone for doing that.

1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:37.920
 You also might end up in jail, you know, if it's security cameras and there's just norms,

1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:38.920
 you know, we're all trained.

1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:40.400
 That's what awful people do, right?

1:08:40.400 --> 1:08:44.400
 So there's, it's not the human nature doesn't have it in it to be like that.

1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:49.080
 It's that this environment we're in has made that a much, much, much smaller experience

1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:50.240
 for people.

1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:53.560
 There's so many examples like that where it's like, man, you don't realize how much of the

1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:56.560
 worst human nature is contained by our environment.

1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:01.560
 And but I think that, you know, rapidly changing environment, which is what we have right now,

1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:02.560
 social media starts.

1:09:02.560 --> 1:09:04.320
 I mean, what a seismic change to the environment.

1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:08.120
 There's a lot of examples like that rapidly changing environment can create rapidly changing

1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:11.960
 behavior and wisdom sometimes can't keep up.

1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:16.440
 And so we, you know, we can, we can really kind of lose our grip on some of the good

1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:17.440
 behavior.

1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:23.120
 Were you surprised by Elon's answer about brain transplants or sands about nuclear power

1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:24.640
 or anything else?

1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:32.080
 Just Sam's, I think is, I have a friend, Isabel Boa Mekke, who has a, who's a nuclear power,

1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:33.080
 you know, influencer.

1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:38.060
 I've become very convinced and I've not done my deep dive on this.

1:09:38.060 --> 1:09:42.720
 But here's, in this case, this is, this is reasoning by analogy here.

1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:47.160
 The amount of really smart people I respect who all, who seem to have dug in, who all

1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:50.080
 say nuclear power is clearly a good option.

1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:54.160
 It's obviously emission free, but, you know, the, the concerns about meltdowns and waste,

1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:56.960
 they see, they say they're completely overblown.

1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:01.720
 So judging from those people, secondary knowledge here, I will say I'm, I'm a, I'm a strong

1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:02.720
 advocate.

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:07.240
 I haven't done my own deep dive yet, but it does seem like a little bit odd that you've

1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:13.440
 got people who are so concerned about climate change who have, it seems like it's kind of

1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:19.440
 an ideology where nuclear power doesn't fit rather than rational, you know, fear of climate

1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:22.400
 change that somehow is anti nuclear power.

1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:23.400
 It just, yeah.

1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:27.920
 I personally am uncomfortably reasoning by analogy with climate change.

1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:29.760
 I've actually have not done a deep dive myself.

1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:30.760
 Me neither.

1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:37.560
 Because it's so, man, it seems like a deep dive and my reasoning by analogy there currently

1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:41.960
 has me thinking it's a truly existential thing, but feeling hopeful.

1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:46.280
 So let me, this is me speaking and this is speaking from a person who's not done the

1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:48.400
 deep dive.

1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:52.600
 I'm a little suspicious of the amount of fear mongering going on.

1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:56.040
 I've, especially over the past couple of years, I've gotten uncomfortable with fear

1:10:56.040 --> 1:10:59.360
 mongering in all walks of life.

1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:04.320
 There's way too many people interested in manipulating the populace with fear.

1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:05.440
 And so I don't like it.

1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:11.640
 I should probably do a deep dive cause to me it's at the, well, the, the big problem

1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:17.400
 with the opposition to climate change or whatever the fear mongering is that it also grows

1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:19.760
 the skepticism and science broadly.

1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:23.400
 It's like, and that, so I need to make sure I do that deep dive.

1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:28.040
 I have listened to a few folks who kind of criticize the fear mongering and all those

1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:30.920
 kinds of things, but they're few and far between.

1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:33.880
 And so it's like, all right, what is the truth here?

1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:39.240
 And it feels lazy, but it also feels like it's hard to get to the, like there's a lot

1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:50.320
 of kind of activists talking about idea versus like sources of objective, like calm first

1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:52.560
 principles type reasoning.

1:11:52.560 --> 1:11:58.480
 Like one of the things, I know it's supposed to be a very big problem, but when people

1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:04.840
 talk about catastrophic effects of climate change, I haven't been able to like see really

1:12:04.840 --> 1:12:12.720
 great deep analysis of what that looks like in 10, 20, 30 years, raising, rising sea levels.

1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:17.800
 What are the models of how that changes human behavior, society?

1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:19.600
 What are the things that happen?

1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:23.440
 There's going to be constraints on the resources and people are going to have to move around.

1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:24.440
 This is happening gradually.

1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:26.800
 Are we going to be able to respond to this?

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:27.960
 How would we respond to this?

1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:32.720
 What are the best, like what are the best models for how everything goes wrong?

1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:40.040
 And I was, this is a question I keep starting to ask myself without doing any research,

1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:46.200
 like motivating myself to get up to this deep dive that I feel is deep, just watching people

1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:51.040
 not do a great job of that kind of modeling with the pandemic and sort of being caught

1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:55.640
 off guard and wondering, okay, if we're not good with this pandemic, how are we going

1:12:55.640 --> 1:12:57.600
 to respond to other kinds of tragedies?

1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:59.400
 Well, this is part of why I wrote the book.

1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:06.080
 Because I said, we're going to have more and more of these big collective, what should

1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:10.840
 we do here situations, whether it's how about when, we're probably not that far away from

1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:16.080
 people being able to go and decide the IQ of their kid or make a bunch of embryos and

1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:18.680
 actually pick the highest IQ.

1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:20.440
 Can possibly go wrong.

1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:25.040
 And also imagine the political sides of that and something only wealthy people can afford

1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:27.360
 it first and just the nightmare, right?

1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:31.320
 We need to be able to have our wits about us as a species where we can actually get

1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:36.680
 into a topic like that and come up with it where the collective brain can be smart.

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:41.440
 I think that there are certain topics where I think of this, and this is again another

1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:44.480
 simplistic model, but I think it works is that there's a higher mind and a primitive

1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:45.480
 mind, right?

1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:47.440
 You can, you know, in your head.

1:13:47.440 --> 1:13:49.000
 And these team up with others.

1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:53.160
 So when the higher minds are in a higher mind is more rational and puts out ideas that it's

1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:54.160
 not attached to.

1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:58.400
 And so it can, it can change its mind easily because it's just an idea and the higher mind

1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:00.480
 can get criticized.

1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:03.040
 Their ideas can get criticized and it's no big deal.

1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:06.840
 And so when the higher minds team up, it's like all these people in the room, like throwing

1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:08.400
 out ideas and kicking them.

1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:11.160
 And one idea goes out and everyone criticizes it, which is like, you know, shooting bows

1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:12.160
 and arrows at it.

1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:15.680
 And the truth, the true idea is, you know, the bow, the arrows bounce off and it's so

1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:18.320
 okay, it rises up and the other ones get shot down.

1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:19.560
 So it's this incredible system.

1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:23.000
 This is what, you know, this is what a good science institution is, is, you know, someone

1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:27.800
 puts out a thing, criticism, arrows come at it and, you know, most of them fall and the

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:30.440
 needle is in the haystack, end up rising up, right?

1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:31.440
 Incredible mechanisms.

1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:34.820
 So what that's happening is a bunch of people, a bunch of flawed, medium scientists are

1:14:34.820 --> 1:14:39.000
 creating super intelligence.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:43.720
 Then there's the primitive mind, which, you know, is the more limbic system part of our

1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:44.720
 brain.

1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:48.800
 It's the, it's a part of us that is very much not living in 2021.

1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:53.680
 It's living many tens of thousands of years ago and it does not treat ideas like this

1:14:53.680 --> 1:14:54.680
 separate thing.

1:14:54.680 --> 1:14:56.720
 It identifies with its ideas.

1:14:56.720 --> 1:14:59.920
 It only gets involved when it finds an idea sacred.

1:14:59.920 --> 1:15:02.160
 It starts holding an idea sacred and it starts identifying.

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:04.560
 So what happens is they team up too.

1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:09.440
 And so when you have a topic that a bunch of primitive, that really rouses a bunch of

1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:16.560
 primitive minds, it quickly, the primitive minds team up and they create an echo chamber

1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:18.480
 where suddenly no one can criticize this.

1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:22.720
 And in fact, if it's powerful enough, people outside the community, no one can criticize

1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:23.720
 it.

1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:24.720
 We will get your paper retracted.

1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:25.720
 We will get you fired.

1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:26.720
 Right?

1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:27.720
 That's not higher mind behavior.

1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:28.720
 That is crazy primitive mind.

1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:32.960
 And so now what happens is the collective becomes dumber than an individual, a dumber

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:34.960
 than a reason, a single reasoning individual.

1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:40.960
 You have this collective is suddenly attached to this sacred scripture with the idea and

1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:44.360
 they will not change their mind and they get dumber and dumber.

1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:49.800
 And so climate change, what's worrisome is that climate change has in many ways become

1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:53.400
 a sacred topic where if you come up with a nuanced thing, you might get called branded

1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:54.400
 a denier.

1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:55.400
 Yes.

1:15:55.400 --> 1:16:00.280
 So there goes the super intelligence, all the arrows, no arrows can be fired, but if

1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:05.160
 you get called a denier, that's a social penalty for firing an arrow at a certain orthodoxy.

1:16:05.160 --> 1:16:09.000
 And so what's happening is the big brain gets frozen and it becomes very stupid.

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:15.400
 Now, you can also say that about a lot of other topics right now, you just mentioned

1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:16.400
 another one.

1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:19.160
 I forget what it was, but that's also kind of like this.

1:16:19.160 --> 1:16:20.160
 The world of vaccine.

1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:21.160
 Yeah.

1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:22.160
 COVID.

1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:26.280
 And here's my point earlier is that what I see is that the political divide is like

1:16:26.280 --> 1:16:28.440
 a whirlpool that's pulling everything into it.

1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:35.040
 And in that whirlpool, thinking is done with the primitive mind tribes.

1:16:35.040 --> 1:16:40.280
 And so I get, okay, obviously something like race, that makes sense, that also right now,

1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:43.960
 the topic of race, for example, or gender, these things are in the whirlpool.

1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:48.040
 But that at least is like, okay, that's something that the primitive mind would always get really

1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:49.040
 worked up about.

1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:53.040
 It taps into like our deepest kind of like primal selves.

1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:57.880
 COVID, maybe it's COVID in a way too, but climate change, that should just be something

1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:00.480
 that our rational brains are like, let's solve this complex problem.

1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:04.400
 But the problem is that it's all gotten sucked into the red versus blue whirlpool.

1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:07.240
 And once that happens, it's in the hands of the primitive minds and we're losing our

1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:12.520
 ability to be wise together to make decisions where it's like, it's like the big species

1:17:12.520 --> 1:17:16.920
 brain is like, or the big American brain is like drunk at the wheel right now.

1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:21.760
 And we're about to go into our future with more and more big technologies, scary things

1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:26.120
 with to make big, right decisions and not, you know, we're getting dumber as a collective.

1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:28.520
 And that's part of this environmental problem.

1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:32.360
 So within the space of technologists and the space of scientists, we should allow the

1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:33.480
 arrows.

1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:39.400
 That's one of the saddest things to me about is like the scientists, like I, I've seen

1:17:39.400 --> 1:17:40.400
 arrogance.

1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:42.520
 There's a lot of mechanisms that maintain the tribe.

1:17:42.520 --> 1:17:43.520
 It's the arrogance.

1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:48.840
 It's, it's, it's how you built up the, this mechanism that defends this wall that defends

1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:50.280
 against the arrows.

1:17:50.280 --> 1:17:59.720
 It's arrogance, credentialism, like just ego really, and then just, it protects you from

1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:05.560
 actually challenging your own ideas, this ideal of science that makes science beautiful

1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:12.040
 in, in a time of fear and in a time of division created by perhaps politicians that leveraged

1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:13.040
 the fear.

1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:16.280
 It, like you said, makes the whole system dumber.

1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:23.320
 The science system dumber, the, the tech developer system dumber, if they don't allow

1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:25.120
 the challenging of ideas.

1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:29.400
 What's really bad is that like in a normal environment, you're always going to have echo

1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:30.400
 chambers.

1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:32.280
 And so what's the opposite of an echo chamber?

1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:35.760
 I, I created a term for it because I think we need it, which is called an idea lab, an

1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:36.760
 idea lab, right?

1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:40.160
 It's like people treat, it's like people act like scientists, even they're not doing

1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:41.160
 science.

1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:44.760
 They just treat their ideas like science experiments and they toss them out there and everyone

1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:47.120
 disagrees and disagreement is like the game.

1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:50.280
 Everyone likes to disagree, you know, on a certain text thread where everyone is just,

1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:52.560
 you know, saying, you know, it's almost like someone throws something out and just it's

1:18:52.560 --> 1:18:56.400
 an impulse for the rest of the group to say, oh, I think you're being like overly general

1:18:56.400 --> 1:18:57.400
 there.

1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:00.920
 Yeah, aren't you kind of being, I think that's like your bias showing and it's like no one's

1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:03.760
 getting offended because it's like, we're all just messing, we all of course respect

1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:04.760
 each other.

1:19:04.760 --> 1:19:08.920
 Obviously we're just, we're just, you know, trashing each other's ideas and that the

1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:10.160
 whole group becomes smarter.

1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:12.880
 You're always going to have idea labs and echo chambers, right?

1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:16.360
 In different communities and most of us participate in both of them, you know, and, you know,

1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:18.120
 maybe in your marriage is a great idea lab.

1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:22.040
 You love to disagree with your, your spouse and maybe in, but this group of friends are

1:19:22.040 --> 1:19:25.080
 at your family at home, you know, you know, in front of that sister, you do not bring

1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:29.640
 up politics because she's now enforced when that happens, her bullying is forcing the

1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:32.960
 whole room to be an echo chamber to appease her.

1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:37.560
 Now what scares me is that usually you have these things existing kind of in bubbles and

1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:40.680
 usually there's like, and they each have their natural defenses against each other.

1:19:40.680 --> 1:19:44.280
 So an echo chamber person stays in their echo chamber.

1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:45.760
 They don't like, they will cut you out.

1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:47.880
 They don't like, they don't like to be friends with people who disagree with them.

1:19:47.880 --> 1:19:49.080
 You notice that they will cut you out.

1:19:49.080 --> 1:19:51.680
 They'll cut out their parents if they vote for Trump or whatever, right?

1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:54.480
 So they're, that's how they do it.

1:19:54.480 --> 1:19:57.280
 They will say, I'm going to stay inside of an echo chamber safely.

1:19:57.280 --> 1:20:02.560
 So my ideas, which I identify with, because my primitive mind is doing the thinking, are

1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:07.480
 not going to ever have to get challenged because it feels so scary and awful for that to happen.

1:20:07.480 --> 1:20:10.080
 But if they leave and they go into an idea lab environment, they're going to, people

1:20:10.080 --> 1:20:11.080
 are going to say, what?

1:20:11.080 --> 1:20:12.080
 No, they're going to disagree.

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:13.800
 And they're going to say, and the person is going to try to bully, you know, they're

1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:16.680
 going to say, that's really offensive and people are going to say, no, it's not.

1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:19.280
 And they're going to, they're going to immediately say, these people are assholes, right?

1:20:19.280 --> 1:20:24.440
 So the echo chamber person, it doesn't have much power once they leave the echo chamber.

1:20:24.440 --> 1:20:28.040
 Likewise, the idea lab person, they have this great environment, but if they go into an

1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:30.960
 echo chamber where everyone else is, and they do that, they'll get kicked out of the group,

1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:35.640
 they'll get branded as something, you know, a denier, a racist, you know, a right wing

1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:40.040
 or a radical, you know, these, these, these nasty words.

1:20:40.040 --> 1:20:45.680
 The thing that I don't like right now is that the echo chambers have found ways to forcefully

1:20:45.680 --> 1:20:52.320
 expand into places that normally are, have a pretty good immune system against echo chambers

1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:57.200
 like universities, like science journals, places where usually it's like there's a strong

1:20:57.200 --> 1:20:58.200
 idea lab culture.

1:20:58.200 --> 1:21:02.840
 They're veritas, you know, you know, that's, that's an idea lab slogan.

1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:07.880
 You have is that these people have found a way to, a lot of people have found a way to

1:21:07.880 --> 1:21:11.280
 actually go out of their thing and keep their echo chamber by making sure that everyone

1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:17.200
 is scared because they can punish anyone, whether you're in their community or not.

1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:19.280
 That's all brilliantly put.

1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:24.080
 The book coming up and the idea June, July, we're not quite sure yet.

1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:25.080
 Okay.

1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:26.080
 I can't wait.

1:21:26.080 --> 1:21:27.080
 Thanks.

1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:28.080
 It's awesome.

1:21:28.080 --> 1:21:29.080
 Do you have a title yet?

1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:30.080
 Or you can't talk about that.

1:21:30.080 --> 1:21:31.080
 Still working on it.

1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:32.080
 Okay.

1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:33.080
 If it's okay.

1:21:33.080 --> 1:21:34.080
 Just a couple of questions from Mailbag.

1:21:34.080 --> 1:21:35.080
 I just love these.

1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:37.640
 I would love to, I would love to hear you riff on these.

1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:39.720
 So one is about film and music.

1:21:39.720 --> 1:21:42.080
 Why do we prefer to watch the question goes?

1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:47.360
 Why do we prefer to watch a film we haven't watched before, but we want to listen to songs

1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:50.240
 that we have heard hundreds of times?

1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:54.560
 This question and your answer really started to make me think like, yeah, that's true.

1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:55.560
 That's really interesting.

1:21:55.560 --> 1:21:59.200
 Like we draw that line somehow.

1:21:59.200 --> 1:22:00.360
 So what's the answer?

1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:02.680
 So I think, let's use these two minds again.

1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:06.320
 I think that when your higher mind is the one who's taking something in and they're

1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:10.800
 really interested in, what are the lyrics or I'm going to learn something or reading

1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:11.800
 a book or whatever.

1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:17.280
 The higher mind is trying to get information and once it has it, there's no point in listening

1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:18.280
 to it again.

1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:20.160
 It has the information.

1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:23.720
 Your rational brain is like, I got it.

1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:28.280
 But when you eat a good meal or have sex or whatever, that's something you can do again

1:22:28.280 --> 1:22:32.840
 and again because it actually, your primitive brain loves it, right?

1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:35.440
 And it never gets bored of things that it loves.

1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:38.080
 So I think music is a very primal thing.

1:22:38.080 --> 1:22:42.080
 I think music goes right into our primitive brain a lot.

1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:44.560
 I think it's, of course, it's a kind of collaboration.

1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:47.560
 Your rational brain is absorbing the actual message.

1:22:47.560 --> 1:22:50.080
 But I think it's all about emotions and even more than emotions.

1:22:50.080 --> 1:22:59.400
 It literally, like the music taps into some very, very deep, primal part of us.

1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:03.760
 And so when you hear a song once, even some of your favorite songs, the first time you

1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:07.440
 heard it, you were like, I guess that's kind of catchy.

1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:10.240
 And then you end up loving it on the 10th listen.

1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:11.640
 But sometimes you even don't even like a song.

1:23:11.640 --> 1:23:12.640
 You're like, oh, this song sucks.

1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:16.240
 You suddenly, you find yourself on the 40th time because it's on the radio all the time,

1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:17.240
 just kind of being like, oh, I love this song.

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:19.920
 And you're like, wait, I don't, I hate this song.

1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:25.440
 And what's happening is that the sound is actually, the music is actually carving a

1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:27.640
 pathway in your brain.

1:23:27.640 --> 1:23:29.280
 And it's a dance.

1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:33.120
 And when your brain knows what's coming, it can dance, it knows the steps.

1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:37.560
 So your brain is, your internal kind of, your brain is actually dancing with the music and

1:23:37.560 --> 1:23:42.040
 it knows the steps and it can anticipate.

1:23:42.040 --> 1:23:47.040
 And so there's something about knowing, having memorized the song that makes it incredibly

1:23:47.040 --> 1:23:49.000
 enjoyable to us.

1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:50.800
 But when we hear it for the first time, we don't know where it's going to go.

1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:51.800
 We're like an awkward dancer.

1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:52.800
 We don't know the steps.

1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:54.960
 And your primitive brain can't really have that much fun yet.

1:23:54.960 --> 1:23:55.960
 That's how I feel.

1:23:55.960 --> 1:24:00.080
 And in the movies, that's more, that's less primitive.

1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:02.120
 That's the story.

1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:03.120
 You're taking in.

1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:07.520
 But a really good movie that we really love, often we will watch it like 12 times, you know,

1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:08.520
 and still like it.

1:24:08.520 --> 1:24:11.920
 Not that many, but versus if you're watching a talk show, right?

1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:15.840
 If you're listening to one of your podcasts as a perfect example, there's not many people

1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:19.280
 that will listen to one of your podcasts, no matter how good it is, 12 times.

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:21.480
 Because it's, once you've got it, you got it.

1:24:21.480 --> 1:24:25.560
 It's a form of information that's very higher mind focused.

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:26.560
 That's how it works.

1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:31.080
 Well, you know, the funny thing is, there is people that listen to a podcast episode

1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:32.400
 many, many times.

1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:36.160
 And often I think the reason for that is not because the information is the chemistry is

1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:38.200
 the music of the conversation.

1:24:38.200 --> 1:24:39.200
 So it's not the actual.

1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:40.200
 It's the art of it.

1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:41.200
 They like.

1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:44.120
 They don't love with some kind of person, some weird personality and they'll just be

1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:47.720
 listening to, they'll be captivated by the, the beat of that kind of person.

1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:48.720
 Or like a standup comic.

1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:53.960
 I've watched like certain things like episodes like 20 times, even though, you know, I have

1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:56.560
 to ask you about the wizard hat.

1:24:56.560 --> 1:24:58.080
 You had a blog about Neuralink.

1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:04.240
 I got a chance to visit Neuralink a couple of times hanging out with those folks.

1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:09.840
 That was one of the pieces of writing you did that like changes culture and changes

1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:13.600
 the way people think about a thing.

1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:20.360
 The ridiculousness of your stick figure drawings or somehow it's like, you know, it's like

1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:23.000
 calling the origin of the universe the big bang.

1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:29.000
 It's a silly title, but it somehow sticks to be the representative of, of, of that in

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:34.360
 the same way the wizard hat for the Neuralink is somehow was a really powerful way to, to

1:25:34.360 --> 1:25:39.040
 explain that you actually proposed that the, the man of the year cover of time should be

1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:40.040
 a.

1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:41.040
 One of my drawings.

1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:42.040
 One of your drawings.

1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:43.040
 Yeah.

1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:44.040
 This is an outrage that it wasn't.

1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:45.040
 It was.

1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:46.040
 Okay.

1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:50.800
 So what are your thoughts about like all those years later about Neuralink?

1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:56.960
 Do you find this idea like what excites you about is the big long term philosophical things?

1:25:56.960 --> 1:26:01.600
 Is it the practical things do you think it's super difficult to do on the neurosurgery

1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:07.720
 side and the material engineering, the robotics side, or do you think the machine learning

1:26:07.720 --> 1:26:11.360
 side for the brain computer interfaces where they get to learn and bought each other, all

1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:12.360
 that kind of stuff.

1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:16.280
 I would just love to get your thoughts because you're one of the people that really considered

1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:18.120
 this problem, really studied it.

1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:19.120
 Yeah.

1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:20.120
 Computer interfaces.

1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:21.960
 I mean, I'm super excited about it.

1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:28.320
 It's a, I really think it's actually Elon's most ambitious thing more than colonizing

1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:32.320
 Mars because that's just a bunch of people going somewhere, even though it's somewhere

1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:37.800
 far, Neuralink is changing what a person is eventually.

1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:43.880
 Now, I think that Neuralink engineers and Elon himself would all be the first to admit

1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:46.920
 that it is a maybe whether they can do their goals here.

1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:52.920
 I mean, it is so crazy ambitious to try to, even their eventual goals are, of course,

1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:56.320
 in the interim, they have a higher probability of accomplishing smaller things, which are

1:26:56.320 --> 1:27:02.880
 still huge, like basically solving paralysis, strokes, Parkinson, things like that.

1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:07.720
 It can be unbelievable and anyone who doesn't have one of these things, we might.

1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:15.560
 Everyone should be very happy about this kind of helping with different disabilities.

1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:22.720
 But the thing that is so, the grand goal is this augmentation where it's, you take someone

1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:30.720
 who's totally healthy and you put a brain machine interface in anyway to give them superpowers.

1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:35.320
 The possibilities if they can do this, if they can really, so they've already shown

1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:38.760
 that they are for real, but they've created this robot.

1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:43.080
 Elon talks about it should be like LASIK where it's not, it shouldn't be something

1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:44.080
 that needs a surgeon.

1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:48.240
 It shouldn't just be for rich people who have waited in line for six months.

1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:52.080
 It should be for anyone who can afford LASIK and eventually, hopefully, something that

1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:56.520
 isn't covered by insurance or something that anyone can do.

1:27:56.520 --> 1:28:01.800
 Something this big a deal should be something that anyone can afford eventually.

1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:06.320
 When we have this, again, I'm talking about a very advanced phase down the road.

1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:13.360
 Maybe a less advanced phase, maybe right now, if you think about when you listen to a song,

1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:14.360
 what's happening?

1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:17.000
 Do you actually hear the sound?

1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.760
 Well, not really.

1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:22.320
 It's that the sound is coming out of the speaker.

1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:23.640
 The speaker is vibrating.

1:28:23.640 --> 1:28:25.200
 It's vibrating air molecules.

1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:32.800
 Those air molecules get vibrated all the way to your head, the pressure wave, and then

1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:34.640
 it vibrates your eardrum.

1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:40.400
 Your eardrum is really the speaker now in your head that then vibrates bones and fluid,

1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:47.920
 which then stimulates neurons in your auditory cortex, which give you the perception that

1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:49.440
 you're hearing sound.

1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:55.200
 Now, if you think about that, do we really need to have a speaker to do that?

1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:58.040
 You could just somehow, if you had a little tiny thing that could vibrate eardrums, you

1:28:58.040 --> 1:28:59.400
 could do it that way.

1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:01.040
 That seems very hard.

1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:04.980
 But really what you needed to go to the very end with the thing that really needs to happen

1:29:04.980 --> 1:29:09.760
 is your auditory cortex neurons need to be stimulated in a certain way.

1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:14.040
 If you have a ton of neural link things in there, neural link electrodes, and then they're

1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:17.960
 getting really good at stimulating things, you could play a song in your head that you

1:29:17.960 --> 1:29:20.560
 hear that is not playing anywhere.

1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:23.560
 There's no sound in the room, but you hear it, and no one else could.

1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:25.360
 It's not like they can get close to your head and hear it.

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:26.360
 There's no sound.

1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:28.320
 They could not hear anything, but you hear sound.

1:29:28.320 --> 1:29:29.320
 You can turn it up.

1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:31.320
 So you open your phone, you have the neural link app.

1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:34.080
 You open the neural link app, or just neural.

1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:39.040
 So basically, you can open your Spotify, and you can play to your speaker, you can play

1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:42.640
 to your computer, you can play right out of your phone to your headphones, or you have

1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:44.960
 now a new one, you can play into your brain.

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:47.220
 And this is one of the earlier things.

1:29:47.220 --> 1:29:50.720
 This is something that seems really doable.

1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:52.220
 So no more headphones.

1:29:52.220 --> 1:29:56.840
 I always think it's so annoying because I can leave the house with just my phone.

1:29:56.840 --> 1:30:00.120
 And nothing else, or even just an Apple Watch, but there's always this one thing, and headphones.

1:30:00.120 --> 1:30:01.120
 You do need your headphones.

1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:03.160
 So I feel like that'll be the end of that.

1:30:03.160 --> 1:30:08.600
 But there's so many things that you, and you keep going, the ability to think together.

1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:11.480
 You can talk about super brains.

1:30:11.480 --> 1:30:16.040
 One of the examples Elon uses is the low bandwidth of speech.

1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:20.160
 If I go to a movie, and I come out of a scary movie, and you say, how was I?

1:30:20.160 --> 1:30:21.160
 I said, oh, it was terrifying.

1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:22.920
 Well, what did I just do?

1:30:22.920 --> 1:30:26.600
 I just gave you, I just gave you, I had five buckets I could have given you.

1:30:26.600 --> 1:30:30.760
 One was horrifying, terrifying, scary, eerie, creepy, whatever.

1:30:30.760 --> 1:30:32.160
 That's about it.

1:30:32.160 --> 1:30:36.600
 And I had a much more nuanced experience than that.

1:30:36.600 --> 1:30:39.560
 And all I have is these words, right?

1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:43.480
 And so instead I just hand you the bucket, where I put the stuff in the bucket and give

1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:44.480
 it to you.

1:30:44.480 --> 1:30:45.480
 But all you have is the bucket.

1:30:45.480 --> 1:30:47.720
 You just have to guess what I put into that bucket.

1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:51.680
 All you can do is look at the label of the bucket and say, when I say terrifying, here's

1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:52.920
 what I mean.

1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:55.040
 So the point is it's very lossy.

1:30:55.040 --> 1:30:59.080
 I had all this nuanced information of what I thought of the movie, and I'm sending you

1:30:59.080 --> 1:31:04.240
 a very low res package that you're going to now guess what the high res thing looked like.

1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:05.720
 That's language in general.

1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:07.200
 Our thoughts are much more nuanced.

1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:09.720
 We can think to each other, we can do amazing things.

1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:12.920
 We could have a brainstorm that doesn't feel like, oh, we're not talking in each other's

1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:13.920
 head.

1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:14.920
 It's not just that I hear your voice.

1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:15.920
 No, no, no.

1:31:15.920 --> 1:31:16.920
 We are just thinking.

1:31:16.920 --> 1:31:19.880
 No words are being said internally or externally.

1:31:19.880 --> 1:31:21.920
 The two brains are literally collaborating.

1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:22.920
 It's a skill.

1:31:22.920 --> 1:31:23.920
 I'm sure we'd have to get good at it.

1:31:23.920 --> 1:31:26.600
 I'm sure young kids will be great at it, and old people will be bad.

1:31:26.600 --> 1:31:29.640
 But you think together, and together you like, oh, have they joined Epiphany?

1:31:29.640 --> 1:31:31.840
 And how about eight people in a room doing it, right?

1:31:31.840 --> 1:31:34.160
 So it gets, you know, there's other examples.

1:31:34.160 --> 1:31:39.880
 How about when you're a dress designer or a bridge designer, and you want to show people

1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:40.880
 what your dress looks like?

1:31:40.880 --> 1:31:42.600
 Well, right now, you've got to sketch it for a long time.

1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:44.320
 Here, just beam it onto the screen from your head.

1:31:44.320 --> 1:31:45.320
 So you can picture it.

1:31:45.320 --> 1:31:49.240
 If you can picture a tree in your head, well, you can just suddenly, whatever's in your

1:31:49.240 --> 1:31:50.240
 head, you can be pictured.

1:31:50.240 --> 1:31:52.000
 So we'll have to get very good at it, right?

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:53.000
 And take a skill, right?

1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:54.320
 You know, you're going to have to.

1:31:54.320 --> 1:31:59.400
 But the possibilities, my God, talk about, like, I feel like if that works, if we really

1:31:59.400 --> 1:32:04.320
 do have that as something, I think it'll almost be like a new ADBC line.

1:32:04.320 --> 1:32:08.680
 It's such a big change that the idea of, like, anyone living before everyone had brain machine

1:32:08.680 --> 1:32:12.920
 interfaces is living in, like, before the common era.

1:32:12.920 --> 1:32:15.760
 It's that level of, like, big change if it can work.

1:32:15.760 --> 1:32:19.440
 Yeah, and the, like, replay of memories, just replaying stuff in your head.

1:32:19.440 --> 1:32:20.960
 Oh, my God, yeah.

1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:24.200
 And copying, you know, you can hopefully copy memories onto other things, and you don't

1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:28.000
 have to just rely on your, you know, your wet circuitry.

1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:32.240
 It does make me sad, because you're right, the brain is incredibly neuroplastic, and

1:32:32.240 --> 1:32:34.600
 so it can adjust, it can learn how to do this.

1:32:34.600 --> 1:32:38.600
 I think it'll be a skill, but probably you and I will be too old to truly learn.

1:32:38.600 --> 1:32:41.560
 Well, maybe we can get, there'll be great trainings, you know, I'm spending the next

1:32:41.560 --> 1:32:44.920
 three months in, like, a, you know, one of the neurolinked trainings.

1:32:44.920 --> 1:32:47.720
 But it'll still be a bit of, like, grandpa, I can't.

1:32:47.720 --> 1:32:48.720
 Definitely.

1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:49.720
 This is, you know, I was saying, how am I going to be old?

1:32:49.720 --> 1:32:51.440
 I'm like, no, I'm going to be great at the new phones.

1:32:51.440 --> 1:32:52.680
 It's like, how can it be the phones?

1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:55.880
 It's going to be, you know, the kid's going to be thinking to me, and I'm going to be

1:32:55.880 --> 1:32:57.960
 like, I just, can you just talk, please?

1:32:57.960 --> 1:33:01.720
 They're going to be like, okay, I'll just talk, and they're going to, so that'll be

1:33:01.720 --> 1:33:04.400
 the equivalent of, you know, yelling to your grandpa today.

1:33:04.400 --> 1:33:09.800
 I really suspect, I don't know what your thoughts are, but I grew up in a time when physical

1:33:09.800 --> 1:33:12.080
 contact interaction was valuable.

1:33:12.080 --> 1:33:16.760
 I just feel like that's going to go the way that's going to disappear.

1:33:16.760 --> 1:33:17.760
 Well, why?

1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:20.160
 I mean, is there anything more intimate than thinking with each other?

1:33:20.160 --> 1:33:22.720
 I mean, that's, you talk about, you know, once we were all doing that, it might feel

1:33:22.720 --> 1:33:24.800
 like, man, everyone was so isolated from each other before.

1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:25.800
 Yeah, sorry.

1:33:25.800 --> 1:33:27.520
 So I didn't say that intimacy disappears.

1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:31.720
 I just meant physical, having to be in the same, having to touch each other, is...

1:33:31.720 --> 1:33:33.720
 People like that.

1:33:33.720 --> 1:33:37.240
 If it is important, won't there be whole waves of people start to say, you know, there's

1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:40.640
 all these articles that come out about how, you know, in our metaverse, we've lost something

1:33:40.640 --> 1:33:43.640
 important, and then now there's a huge, I'll first, the hippies start doing it, and then

1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:47.600
 eventually it becomes this big wave, and now everyone won't, you know, if something truly

1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:49.400
 is lost, won't we recover it?

1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:55.080
 Well, I think from first principles, all of the components are there to engineer intimate

1:33:55.080 --> 1:34:00.600
 experiences in the metaverse, or in the cyberspace.

1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:07.840
 And so to me, it's, I don't see anything profoundly unique to the physical experience.

1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:09.320
 Like, I don't understand.

1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:11.360
 But then why are you saying there's a loss there?

1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:16.160
 No, I'm just sad, because I won't, oh, it's a loss for me personally, because the world

1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:17.160
...

1:34:17.160 --> 1:34:18.440
 So then you do think there's something unique in the physical experience?

1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:20.360
 For me, because I was raised with it.

1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:21.360
 Oh.

1:34:21.360 --> 1:34:22.360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:26.280
 But anything you're raised with, you fall in love with, like people in this country came

1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:27.280
 up with baseball.

1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:29.120
 I was raised in the Soviet Union.

1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:30.360
 I don't understand baseball.

1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:36.840
 I get, I like it, but I don't love it the way Americans love it, because a lot of times

1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:41.800
 they went to baseball games with their father, and then there's that family connection.

1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:50.040
 There's a young kid dreaming about, I don't know, becoming an MLB player himself, I don't

1:34:50.040 --> 1:34:51.040
 know, something like that.

1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:54.680
 That's what you're raised with, obviously, is really important, but I mean, fundamentally

1:34:54.680 --> 1:35:00.480
 to the human experience, listen, we're doing this podcast in person, so clearly I still

1:35:00.480 --> 1:35:01.480
 value it.

1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:02.480
 But it's true.

1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:03.480
 If this were...

1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:05.280
 Obviously, if they were screaming, we all agree that's not the same.

1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:06.280
 Yeah, it's not the same.

1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:09.920
 But if this were some, you know, we had contact lenses on, and like, you know, maybe Neuralink,

1:35:09.920 --> 1:35:10.920
 you know, play...

1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:11.920
 Maybe, again, forget...

1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:13.080
 Again, this is all...

1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:16.880
 The devices, even if it's just as cool as a contact lens, that's all old school.

1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:21.000
 Once you have the brain machine interface, it'll just be projection of, you know, it'll

1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:22.360
 take over my visual cortex.

1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:27.200
 My visual cortex will get put into a virtual room in a solo year, so we will see, we will

1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:32.560
 hear, really hear and see, as if where you won't have any masks, no VR mask needed.

1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:36.120
 And at that point, it really will feel like you'll forget, you'll say, we'll read together

1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:37.440
 and physically or not.

1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:38.440
 You won't even...

1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:40.320
 It'd be so unimportant, you won't even remember.

1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:41.320
 And you're right.

1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:46.480
 This is one of those shits in society that changes everything.

1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:50.200
 But romantically, people still need to be together.

1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:55.920
 There's a whole set of, like, physical things with relationship that are needed, you know,

1:35:55.920 --> 1:35:56.920
 like...

1:35:56.920 --> 1:35:57.920
 Like what?

1:35:57.920 --> 1:35:58.920
 Like sex?

1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:01.160
 Sex, but also just, like, there's pheromones, like, there's...

1:36:01.160 --> 1:36:03.320
 The physical touch is such a...

1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:04.320
 That's like music.

1:36:04.320 --> 1:36:08.560
 It goes to such a deeply primitive part of us, that what physical touch with a romantic

1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:10.720
 partner does, that I think that...

1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:13.840
 So, I'm sure there'll be a whole wave of people who...

1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:16.360
 Their new thing is that, you know, you're romantically involved with people you never

1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:18.080
 actually are in person with, but...

1:36:18.080 --> 1:36:20.400
 And I'm sure there'll be things where you can actually smell what's in the room and

1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:21.400
 you can...

1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:22.400
 Yep.

1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:23.400
 And touch?

1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:24.400
 Yeah, but I think that'll be one of the last things to go.

1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:25.400
 I think there'll be...

1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:27.000
 There's something...

1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:31.240
 That to me seems like something that'll be a while before people feel like there's nothing

1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:33.840
 lost by not being in this room.

1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:35.920
 It's very difficult to replicate the human interaction.

1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:38.760
 Although sex also, again, you could...

1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:43.240
 Not to get too, like, weird, but you could have a thing where you're basically, you know,

1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:46.880
 or, you know, let's just do a massage because it's less, like, awkward.

1:36:46.880 --> 1:36:48.280
 But, like, you can...

1:36:48.280 --> 1:36:50.400
 You know, everyone is still imagining sex, so go on.

1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:56.400
 A masseuse could massage a fake body and you could feel whatever's happening.

1:36:56.400 --> 1:36:57.400
 Right?

1:36:57.400 --> 1:37:00.280
 So, you're lying down in your apartment alone, but you're feeling a full...

1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:05.120
 There'll be the new, like, YouTube streaming where it's one masseuse massaging one body,

1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:06.800
 but, like, a thousand people are experiencing it.

1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:07.800
 Exactly.

1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:08.800
 No, think about it.

1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:10.800
 Right now, you know, you don't want Taylor Swift doesn't play for one person that has

1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:14.800
 to go around and everyone of her fans just to go play for, or a book, right?

1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:15.800
 You do it and it goes everywhere.

1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:18.360
 So, it'll be the same idea.

1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:25.240
 You've written and thought a lot about AI, so AI safety specifically.

1:37:25.240 --> 1:37:28.480
 You've mentioned you're actually starting a podcast, which is awesome.

1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:33.200
 You're so good at talking, so good at thinking, so good at being weird in the most beautiful

1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:38.880
 of ways, but you've been thinking about this AI safety question.

1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:43.960
 Where today does your concern lie for the near future, for the long term future?

1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:48.680
 Like, quite a bit of stuff happened, including with Elon's work at Tesla autopilot.

1:37:48.680 --> 1:37:55.720
 There's a bunch of amazing robots with Boston Dynamics and everyone's favorite vacuum robot,

1:37:55.720 --> 1:38:00.680
 iRobot, Roomba, and then there's obviously the applications of machine learning for recommender

1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:04.760
 systems in Twitter, Facebook, and so on.

1:38:04.760 --> 1:38:09.360
 And, you know, face recognition for surveillance, all these kinds of things are happening.

1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:15.560
 A lot of incredible use of, not the face recognition, but the incredible use of deep learning, machine

1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:20.960
 learning to capture information about people and try to recommend to them what they want

1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:24.360
 to consume next.

1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:28.200
 Some of that can be abused, some of that can be used for good, like for Netflix or something

1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:29.200
 like that.

1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:30.440
 What are your thoughts about all this?

1:38:30.440 --> 1:38:36.880
 Yeah, I mean, I really don't think humans are very smart, like all things considered.

1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:43.360
 I think we're like limited, and we're dumb enough that we're very easily manipulable.

1:38:43.360 --> 1:38:49.200
 Not just like, oh, like, our emotions, people can, you know, our emotions can be pulled

1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:50.200
 like puppet strings.

1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:53.240
 I mean, again, I look at, like, I do look at what's going on in political polarization

1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:56.600
 now, and I see a lot of puppet string emotions happening.

1:38:56.600 --> 1:39:01.280
 So yeah, there's a lot to be scared of, for sure, like very scared of.

1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:05.120
 I get excited about a lot of very specific things, like one of the things I get excited

1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:08.200
 about is, like, so the future of wearables, right?

1:39:08.200 --> 1:39:12.200
 Again, I think that, like, oh, the wrist, the fit bit around my wrist is going to seem,

1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:17.880
 you know, the whoop is going to seem really hilariously old school in 20 years.

1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:22.720
 Like when you're like a big bracelet, right, it's going to turn into little sensors in

1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:27.920
 our blood, probably, or, you know, even, you know, infrared, you know, just, just, just

1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:31.200
 things that are going to be, it's going to be collecting 100 times more data than it

1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:34.840
 collects now, more nuanced data, more specific to our body.

1:39:34.840 --> 1:39:38.280
 And it's going to be, you know, super reliable, but that's the hardware side.

1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:42.760
 And then the software is going to be, I've not done my deep dive, this is all speculation,

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:47.000
 but the software is going to get really good, and this is the AI component.

1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:52.520
 And so I get excited about specific things like that, like, think about if you're, if

1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:57.600
 hardware were able to collect, first of all, the hardware knows your whole genome, and

1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:02.440
 we know a lot more about what a genome sequence means, because you can collect your genome

1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:07.240
 now, and we just don't know much, we okay, we don't have much to do with that information.

1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:11.320
 As AI gets, so now you have your genome, you've got what's in your blood at any given moment,

1:40:11.320 --> 1:40:16.160
 all the levels of everything, right, you have the exact width of your heart arteries at

1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:22.200
 any given moment, you've got all the, all the virons, all the viruses that ever visited

1:40:22.200 --> 1:40:24.080
 your body, because there's a trace of it.

1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:28.800
 So you have all the pathogens, all the things that like you should be concerned about health

1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:32.840
 wise, and might have threatened you, you might be immune from all that kind of stuff.

1:40:32.840 --> 1:40:36.600
 They also, of course, it knows how fast your heart is beating, and it knows how much you,

1:40:36.600 --> 1:40:40.760
 you know, exactly the amount of exercise, it knows your muscle mass and your weight

1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:44.360
 and all that, but it also maybe can even know your emotions, I mean, if emotions, you know,

1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:47.640
 what are they, you know, where do they come from, probably pretty obvious chemicals once

1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:48.640
 we get in there.

1:40:48.640 --> 1:40:53.240
 So again, Neuralink can be involved here maybe in collecting information, you know, because

1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:55.560
 right now you have to do the thing, what's your mood right now, and it's hard to even

1:40:55.560 --> 1:40:58.240
 assess, you know, and you're in a bad mood, it's hard to even.

1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:03.880
 But by the way, just as a shout out, Lisa Feldman Barrett, who's in your scientist at

1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:08.280
 Northeastern just wrote a, I mean, not just like a few years ago wrote a whole book saying

1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:12.280
 our expression of emotions is nothing to do with the experience of emotions.

1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:15.480
 So you really actually want to be measuring.

1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:16.480
 That's exactly.

1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:19.960
 And you can tell, because one of these apps pops up and says, we know, what, how do you

1:41:19.960 --> 1:41:20.960
 feel right now?

1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:21.960
 Good bad.

1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:25.120
 I'm like, I don't know, like I feel bad right now because the thing popping up reminded

1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:27.320
 me that I'm procrastinating because I was on my phone.

1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:31.360
 I should be more, you know, like that's not my, you know, so I think it will probably

1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:34.800
 be be able to very get all this info, right?

1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:37.400
 Now the AI can go to town.

1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:41.440
 Think about when the AI gets really good at this and it knows your genome and it knows

1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:46.240
 it can just, I want the AI to just tell me what to do when it turns up.

1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:47.240
 Okay.

1:41:47.240 --> 1:41:48.240
 So how about this?

1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:50.560
 Now imagine attaching that to a meal service, right?

1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:53.520
 And the meal service has everything, you know, all the, you know, million ingredients and

1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:56.080
 supplements and vitamins and everything.

1:41:56.080 --> 1:41:59.360
 And I give the, I tell the AI my broad goals.

1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:03.720
 I want to gain muscle or I want to, you know, maintain my weight, but I want to have more

1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:04.720
 energy or whatever.

1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:07.480
 I just want to, you know, I just want to be very healthy and I want to, obviously everyone

1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:10.400
 wants the same, like 10 basic things like you want to avoid cancer.

1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:14.400
 You want to, you know, various things you want to age slower.

1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:21.520
 So now the AI has my goals and a drone comes at, you know, it's a little thing pops up

1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:25.120
 and this is like, you know, beep beep, like, you know, 15 minutes you're going to eat because

1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:27.600
 it knows that's a great, that's the right time for my body to eat.

1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:32.160
 15 minutes later, a little slot opens in my wall where a drone has come from the factory,

1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:36.920
 the eating, the food factory and dropped the perfect meal for my, that moment for me, for

1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:41.000
 my mood, for my genome, for my blood contents.

1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:42.800
 And it's, it's cause it knows my goals.

1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:45.400
 So you know, it knows I want to feel energy at this time and then I want to wind down

1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:46.400
 here.

1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:47.400
 So those things you have to tell it.

1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:51.880
 Well, plus the pleasure thing, like it knows what kind of components of a meal you've enjoyed

1:42:51.880 --> 1:42:52.880
 in the past.

1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:53.880
 So you can assemble the perfect meal.

1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:54.880
 Exactly.

1:42:54.880 --> 1:42:58.680
 You know, way better than you know yourself, better than any human could ever know you.

1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:01.480
 And it, a little thing pops up, you still have, you still have some choice, right?

1:43:01.480 --> 1:43:06.720
 It's still, it pops up and it says like, you know, coffee, because it knows that, you know,

1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:11.040
 my cutoff, they says, you know, I can have coffee for the next 15 minutes only because

1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:14.040
 at that point it knows how long it stays in my system, it knows what my sleep is like

1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:18.040
 when I have it too late, it knows I have to wake up at this time tomorrow, that's my calendar.

1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:22.440
 So I think a lot of people's, this is, I think something that humans are wrong about is that

1:43:22.440 --> 1:43:24.920
 most people will hear this and be like, that sounds awful.

1:43:24.920 --> 1:43:25.920
 That sounds dystopian.

1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:26.920
 No, it doesn't.

1:43:26.920 --> 1:43:27.920
 It sounds incredible.

1:43:27.920 --> 1:43:30.560
 And if we all had this, we would not look back and be like, I wish I was like making

1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:34.040
 awful choices every day, like I was in the past.

1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:37.000
 And then this isn't, these aren't important decisions.

1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:41.640
 Your important decision making energy, your important focus and your attention can go

1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:46.160
 on to your kids and on your work and on, you know, helping other people and things that

1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:47.160
 matter.

1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:50.640
 And, and so I think AI can, I think, when I think about like personal lifestyle stuff

1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:55.400
 like that, I really love, like, I love thinking about that.

1:43:55.400 --> 1:43:56.400
 I think it's going to be very exciting.

1:43:56.400 --> 1:44:00.880
 I think we'll all be so much healthier that when we look back today, one of the things

1:44:00.880 --> 1:44:04.080
 that's going to look so primitive is the one size fits all thing, getting like reading

1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:07.960
 advice about keto.

1:44:07.960 --> 1:44:12.840
 Each genome is going to have very specific, one, you know, unique advice coming from AI.

1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:13.840
 And so yeah.

1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:14.840
 Yeah.

1:44:14.840 --> 1:44:19.460
 The customization that's enabled by collection of data and the use of AI, a lot of people

1:44:19.460 --> 1:44:23.320
 think what's the, like they think of the worst case scenario, that data being used

1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:26.600
 by authoritarian governments to control you, all that kind of stuff.

1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:30.880
 They don't think about most likely, especially in a capitalist society, it's most likely

1:44:30.880 --> 1:44:35.920
 going to be used as part of a competition to get you the most delicious and healthy

1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:38.040
 meal possible as fast as possible.

1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:39.040
 Yeah.

1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:42.400
 So the world will definitely be much better with the integration of data.

1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:48.400
 But of course you want to be able to be transparent and honest about how that data is misused.

1:44:48.400 --> 1:44:52.040
 And that's why it's important to have free speech and people to speak out like when some

1:44:52.040 --> 1:44:53.680
 bullshers being done by companies.

1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:56.040
 That we need to have our wits about us as a society.

1:44:56.040 --> 1:45:02.840
 Like this is free speech is the mechanism by which the big brain can think, can think

1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:06.040
 for itself, can think straight, can see straight.

1:45:06.040 --> 1:45:10.000
 When you take away free speech, when you start saying that in every topic, when, when, when

1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.920
 any, when any topic is political, it becomes treacherous to talk about.

1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:15.800
 So forget the government taking away free speech.

1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:23.040
 If the culture penalizes nuanced conversation about any topic that's political and the politics

1:45:23.040 --> 1:45:30.160
 is so all consuming and it's such a incredible market to, to polarize people, you know, for

1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:34.680
 media to polarize people and to bring any topic it can into that and get people hooked

1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:36.840
 on it as a political topic.

1:45:36.840 --> 1:45:38.120
 We become a very dumb society.

1:45:38.120 --> 1:45:39.720
 So free speech goes away as far as it matters.

1:45:39.720 --> 1:45:42.440
 You know, people say, oh, people like to say, oh, it's not, you know, you don't even know

1:45:42.440 --> 1:45:43.440
 what free speech is.

1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:46.800
 You know, it's, you know, this is a, your free speech is not being bought.

1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:48.400
 It's like, no, you're right.

1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:52.240
 My first amendment rights are not being violated, but the culture of free speech, which is the

1:45:52.240 --> 1:45:56.760
 second ingredient of two, you need the first amendment and you need the culture of free

1:45:56.760 --> 1:45:57.760
 speech.

1:45:57.760 --> 1:46:00.120
 And now you have free speech and the culture is much more specific.

1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:05.120
 You obviously can have a culture that believes people right now, take any topic again that

1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:11.280
 has to do with like, you know, some very sensitive topics, you know, police shootings, or you

1:46:11.280 --> 1:46:15.120
 know, what's going on in, you know, K through 12 schools or, you know, even, you know, climate

1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:17.200
 change, you know, take, take any of these.

1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:21.520
 And the first amendment is still there, you know, you're not going to get arrested no

1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:22.760
 matter what you say.

1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:27.120
 The culture of free speech is, is gone because you will be destroyed.

1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:30.920
 Your life can be over, you know, as far as it matters.

1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:34.240
 If you say the wrong thing, but even, you know, but a culture of a really vigorous culture

1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:38.560
 of free speech, you get no penalty at all for even saying something super dumb.

1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:42.120
 People will say, like people will laugh and be like, well, that was like kind of hilariously

1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:43.960
 offensive and like not at all correct.

1:46:43.960 --> 1:46:44.960
 Like, you know, you're wrong.

1:46:44.960 --> 1:46:47.200
 And here's what, but no one's like mad at you.

1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:49.560
 Now the brain is thinking at its best.

1:46:49.560 --> 1:46:53.240
 The IQ of the big brain is like as high as it can be in that culture.

1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:56.560
 And the culture where, and you say something wrong and people say, oh, wow, you've changed.

1:46:56.560 --> 1:46:57.560
 Oh, wow.

1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:01.640
 Like, look, this is his real, you know, colors, you know, the big brain is, is dumb.

1:47:01.640 --> 1:47:03.920
 You still have mutual respect for each other.

1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:08.640
 So like, you don't think lesser of others when they say a bunch of dumb things, you

1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:12.520
 know, it's just the play of ideas, but you still have respect, you still have love for

1:47:12.520 --> 1:47:18.640
 them because I think the worst case is when you have a complete free like anarchy of ideas

1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:24.400
 where it's like, like everybody lost hope that the something like a truth can even be

1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:27.720
 converged towards like everybody has their own truth.

1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:29.640
 Then it's just chaos.

1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:34.960
 Like if you have mutual respect and a mutual goal of arriving at the truth and the humility

1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:38.520
 that you want to listen to other people's ideas and a forgiveness that other people's

1:47:38.520 --> 1:47:41.680
 ideas might be dumb as hell, that doesn't mean they're lesser beings, all that kind

1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:42.680
 of stuff.

1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:44.640
 But that, that's like a weird balance of strike.

1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:49.560
 Right now, people are being trained, little kids, college students being trained to think

1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:53.480
 the exact opposite way, to think that there's no such thing as objective truth, which is,

1:47:53.480 --> 1:47:58.720
 you know, the objective truth is the, is the, the, the N on the compass for every thinker.

1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:02.600
 It doesn't mean we're, you know, necessarily on the, on our way or finding, but we're all

1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:03.600
 aiming in the same direction.

1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:07.800
 And we all believe that there's a place we can eventually get closer to.

1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:12.160
 Not objective truth, you know, teaching them that disagreement is bad violence.

1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:18.000
 You know, it's, it's, you know, uh, it's like, you know, it's, you quickly sound like you're

1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:22.520
 just going on like a political rant with this topic, but like it's really bad.

1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:25.000
 It's like genuinely the worst.

1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:31.240
 If I was, had my own country, I mean the, it's like, I would teach kids some very specific

1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:37.560
 things that this is the, doing the exact opposite of, um, and it sucks.

1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:38.560
 It sucks.

1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:43.680
 Speaking of way to escape this, you've tweeted 30 minutes of reading a day equals, yeah,

1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:48.720
 this whole video and it's, it's cool to think about reading like in an, um, as a habit and

1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:53.040
 something that accumulates, you said, uh, 30 minutes of reading a day equals 1000 books

1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:54.040
 in 50 years.

1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:58.760
 I love like thinking about this, like chipping away at the mountain.

1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:03.000
 Uh, can you expand on that sort of, um, the habit of reading?

1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:04.680
 How do you recommend people read?

1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:05.680
 Yeah.

1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:06.680
 Yeah.

1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:07.680
 I mean, it's, it's incredible.

1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:12.440
 If you do something a little of something every day, it compiles, it compiles.

1:49:12.440 --> 1:49:16.800
 You know, I always think about like the people who achieve these incredible things in life,

1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:21.000
 these great, like famous legendary people, they had the same number of days that you

1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:22.000
 do.

1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:23.720
 And it's not like they were doing magical days.

1:49:23.720 --> 1:49:26.760
 They just think they got a little done every day.

1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:34.000
 And that adds up to, uh, to, to a monument, you know, they're putting one brick in a day.

1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.440
 Eventually they have this building, this legendary building.

1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:41.240
 So you can take writing, someone who, you know, there's two aspiring writers and one

1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:44.880
 doesn't ever write, doesn't, you know, manages to never, you know, zero write, zero pages

1:49:44.880 --> 1:49:45.880
 a day.

1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:49.440
 And the other one manages to do, uh, two pages a week, right?

1:49:49.440 --> 1:49:50.440
 Not very much.

1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:55.520
 The zero pages a week, two pages a week, 98% of both of their time is the same.

1:49:55.520 --> 1:49:58.800
 The other person, just 2%, they're doing one other thing.

1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:01.880
 One year later, they have written, they write two books a year.

1:50:01.880 --> 1:50:05.640
 This prolific person, you know, in 20 years, they've written 40 books.

1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:07.240
 They're one of the most prolific writers of all time.

1:50:07.240 --> 1:50:09.080
 They write two pages a week.

1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:11.040
 Um, sorry, that's not true.

1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:12.360
 I was, I would do pages a day.

1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:13.360
 Okay.

1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:16.000
 Two pages a week, you're still writing about a book every two years.

1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:20.040
 So in 20 years, you've still written 10 books, also prolific writer, right?

1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:23.440
 Which massive writing career, you write two pages every Sunday morning.

1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:26.560
 The other person has the same exact week and they don't do that Sunday morning thing.

1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:28.020
 They are a wannabe writer.

1:50:28.020 --> 1:50:31.880
 They always said they could write, they talk about how they used to be, and nothing happens,

1:50:31.880 --> 1:50:32.880
 right?

1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:35.760
 So it's, it's, it's inspiring, I think, for a lot of people who feel frustrated, they're

1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:36.760
 not doing anything.

1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:43.600
 So reading is another example where, um, someone who reads, uh, very, you know, doesn't read

1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:47.400
 and someone who's a prolific reader, you know, I always think about like the Tyler Cowan

1:50:47.400 --> 1:50:48.400
 types.

1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:50.000
 I'm like, how the hell do you read so much?

1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:54.800
 It's infuriating, you know, or like James Clear puts out his like, uh, his 10 favorite

1:50:54.800 --> 1:50:59.680
 books of the year, 20, his 20 favorite books of the year, I'm like, you're 20 favorites.

1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:03.640
 Like I'm trying to just read 20 books, like that would be an amazing year.

1:51:03.640 --> 1:51:08.040
 So, um, but the thing is they're not doing something crazy and magical.

1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:09.520
 They're just reading a half hour a night.

1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:13.200
 You know, if you read a half hour a night, the calculation I came to is that you can

1:51:13.200 --> 1:51:15.320
 read a thousand books in 50 years.

1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:20.120
 So if someone who's 80 and they've read a thousand books, you know, between 30 and 80,

1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:21.720
 they are extremely well read.

1:51:21.720 --> 1:51:24.800
 They can, they can delve deep into many nonfiction areas.

1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:28.680
 They can be, you know, an amazing fiction reader, avid fiction reader.

1:51:28.680 --> 1:51:30.640
 Um, and again, that's a half hour a day.

1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:33.760
 Some people can do an hour or a half hour in the morning audio book, half hour at night

1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:34.760
 in bed.

1:51:34.760 --> 1:51:35.760
 Now they've read 2000 books.

1:51:35.760 --> 1:51:40.920
 So, um, I, I, I think it's, um, it's just, it's just, it's motivating.

1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:45.680
 And you realize that a lot of times you think that the people who are doing amazing things

1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:49.320
 and you're not, you think that there, there's, there, there's a bigger gap between you and

1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:50.800
 them that there really is.

1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:56.560
 Um, I, on the reading front, I'm a very slow reader, which is just, just a very frustrating

1:51:56.560 --> 1:51:57.720
 fact about me.

1:51:57.720 --> 1:52:00.000
 Um, but I'm faster with audio books.

1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:04.400
 Uh, and I also, I just, you know, I'll just, it's just hard to get myself to read, but

1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:09.280
 I've started doing audio books and I'll wake up, throw it on, do it in the shower, brushing

1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:12.720
 my teeth, you know, making breakfast, dealing with the dogs, things like that, whatever,

1:52:12.720 --> 1:52:18.160
 uh, until I sit down and that's, I can read, uh, I can read a book a week, a book every

1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:20.480
 10 days at that clip.

1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:24.280
 And suddenly I'm this big reader because I'm just while doing my morning stuff, I have

1:52:24.280 --> 1:52:26.240
 it on and also it's this fun, it makes the morning so fun.

1:52:26.240 --> 1:52:27.840
 I'm like, I mean, great time the whole morning.

1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:29.560
 Cause I'm like, oh, I'm so into this book.

1:52:29.560 --> 1:52:33.160
 So I think that, you know, audio books is another amazing gift to people who have a

1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:34.160
 hard time reading.

1:52:34.160 --> 1:52:36.200
 I find that that's actually an interesting skill.

1:52:36.200 --> 1:52:38.120
 I do audio books quite a bit.

1:52:38.120 --> 1:52:43.240
 Like it's a skill to maintain, at least for me, probably the kind of books I read, which

1:52:43.240 --> 1:52:50.400
 is often like history or like there's a lot of content and if you miss parts of it, you,

1:52:50.400 --> 1:52:52.000
 you miss out on stuff.

1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:57.880
 And so it's a skill to maintain focus, at least for me, the 10 second back button is

1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:58.880
 very valuable.

1:52:58.880 --> 1:53:02.960
 So I just, I just, if I get lost, it's sometimes that the book is so good that I'm thinking

1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:05.960
 about what the person just said and I just get the skill for me is just remembering to

1:53:05.960 --> 1:53:06.960
 pause.

1:53:06.960 --> 1:53:10.600
 I don't, no problem, just back, back, back, back, just three quick backs.

1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:13.640
 So of course it's not that efficient, but that's, but it's, I do the same thing when

1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:14.640
 I'm reading.

1:53:14.640 --> 1:53:16.280
 I'll read a whole paragraph and realize I was tuning out.

1:53:16.280 --> 1:53:17.280
 You know?

1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:19.760
 You know, I haven't actually even considered to try that.

1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:24.480
 I've been so hard on myself maintaining focus because you do get lost in thought.

1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:25.480
 Maybe I should try that.

1:53:25.480 --> 1:53:26.480
 Yeah.

1:53:26.480 --> 1:53:28.000
 And when you get lost in thought, by the way, you're processing the book.

1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:29.400
 That's not wasted time.

1:53:29.400 --> 1:53:33.840
 That's your brain really categorizing and cataloging what you just read and like, well, there's

1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:36.240
 several kinds of thoughts, right?

1:53:36.240 --> 1:53:39.920
 There's thoughts related to the book and there's a thought that it could take you elsewhere.

1:53:39.920 --> 1:53:45.800
 Well, I find that if I am continually thinking about something else, I just say I'm not,

1:53:45.800 --> 1:53:47.560
 I just pause the book.

1:53:47.560 --> 1:53:48.560
 Yeah.

1:53:48.560 --> 1:53:49.560
 Yeah.

1:53:49.560 --> 1:53:51.960
 Especially in the shower or something when like, that's sometimes when really great thoughts

1:53:51.960 --> 1:53:52.960
 come out.

1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:55.240
 If I'm having all these thoughts about other stuff, I'm saying, clearly my mind wants to

1:53:55.240 --> 1:53:56.240
 work on something else.

1:53:56.240 --> 1:53:57.240
 I'll just pause it.

1:53:57.240 --> 1:53:58.240
 Yeah.

1:53:58.240 --> 1:53:59.240
 Quiet, Dan Carlin.

1:53:59.240 --> 1:54:00.240
 I'm thinking about something else right now.

1:54:00.240 --> 1:54:01.240
 Exactly.

1:54:01.240 --> 1:54:02.240
 Exactly.

1:54:02.240 --> 1:54:04.320
 Also, you can, things like you're, you have to head out to the store.

1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:08.080
 Like I'm going to read 20 pages on that trip, just walking back and forth, going to the

1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:09.080
 airport.

1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:12.600
 I mean, flights, you know, the Uber and then you're walking to the, walking through the

1:54:12.600 --> 1:54:14.000
 airport, you're sharing the security line.

1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:15.320
 I'm reading the whole time.

1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:17.560
 Like, I know this is not groundbreaking.

1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:21.000
 People know what audiobooks are, but I think that more people should probably get into them

1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:22.000
 than do.

1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.600
 I know a lot of people that have this stubborn kind of things that I don't like, I like to

1:54:24.600 --> 1:54:27.920
 have the paper book and sure, but like, it's pretty fun to be able to read.

1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:34.120
 I, I still, I listen to a huge number of audiobooks and podcasts, but I still, the most impactful

1:54:34.120 --> 1:54:39.360
 experiences for me are still reading and I read very, very slow and it's very frustrating

1:54:39.360 --> 1:54:46.000
 when like, you go to these websites, like that estimate how long a book takes on average.

1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:47.000
 Those are always annoying.

1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:51.840
 They do like a page a minute when I read like best, a page every two minutes at best.

1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:55.760
 At best when you're like really like, actually not pausing.

1:54:55.760 --> 1:55:01.240
 I just, my ADD, it's like, I just, it's hard to keep focusing and I also like to really

1:55:01.240 --> 1:55:02.240
 absorb.

1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:06.000
 I, I, on the other side of things, when I finish a book, 10 years later, I'll be like,

1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.200
 you know, that scene when this happens and another friend of red would be like, what?

1:55:08.200 --> 1:55:11.440
 I don't remember any like details and like, oh, I can tell you like the entire, so I absorbed

1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:15.400
 the shit out of it, but I don't think it's worth it to like have read so less, so much

1:55:15.400 --> 1:55:16.400
 less in my life.

1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:21.280
 I actually, so in terms of going to the airport, you know, in these like filler moments of

1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:24.880
 life, I do a lot of us, it's an app called Anki.

1:55:24.880 --> 1:55:26.840
 I don't know if you know, know about it.

1:55:26.840 --> 1:55:29.280
 It's a space repetition app.

1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:32.440
 So there's all of these facts I have when I read, I write it down.

1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:38.160
 If I want to remember it, and it's these, it, you review it and the one, the things you

1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:41.400
 remember, it takes longer and longer to bring back up.

1:55:41.400 --> 1:55:43.760
 It's like flashcards, but a digital app.

1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:44.760
 It's called Anki.

1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:45.760
 I recommend it to a lot of people.

1:55:45.760 --> 1:55:48.360
 There's a huge community of people that are just like obsessed with it.

1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:49.360
 A, N, K, E.

1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:51.800
 A, N, K, I.

1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:59.120
 So this is extremely well known app and idea like among students who are like medical students.

1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:02.040
 Like people that really have to study.

1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:03.760
 Like this is not like fun stuff.

1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:06.320
 They really have to memorize a lot of things.

1:56:06.320 --> 1:56:07.320
 They have to remember them well.

1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:09.520
 They have to be able to integrate them with a bunch of ideas.

1:56:09.520 --> 1:56:16.640
 So, and I find it to be really useful for, like when you read history, if you think this

1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:22.720
 particular factoid, they'll probably be extremely useful for you because you're, that'd be interesting

1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.600
 actually thought because you're doing, you talked about like opening up a trillion tabs

1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:32.760
 and reading things, you know, you probably want to remember some facts you read along

1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:33.760
 the way.

1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:37.160
 Like you might remember, okay, this thing I can't directly put into the writing, but

1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:38.800
 it's a cool little factoid.

1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:41.520
 I want to store that in there.

1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:43.720
 And that's what I go Anki, drop it in.

1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:45.600
 Oh, you can just drop it in.

1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:48.320
 You drop it in a line of a podcast or like a video.

1:56:48.320 --> 1:56:50.640
 Well, no, I guess I can type it though.

1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:51.640
 So, yes.

1:56:51.640 --> 1:56:55.920
 So Anki, there's a bunch of, it's called space repetitions is a bunch of apps that are much

1:56:55.920 --> 1:56:56.920
 nicer than Anki.

1:56:56.920 --> 1:57:02.440
 Anki is the ghetto like Craigslist version, but it has a giant community because people

1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:04.600
 are like, we don't want features.

1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:08.800
 We want a text box, like it's very basic, very stripped down.

1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:09.880
 So you can drop in stuff.

1:57:09.880 --> 1:57:10.880
 You can drop in.

1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:13.520
 That sounds really, I can't believe I have not come across this.

1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:18.760
 You actually, once you're looking at it, you realize that how have I not come, you are

1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:19.760
 the person.

1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:20.760
 Yeah.

1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:21.960
 I guarantee you'll probably write a blog about it.

1:57:21.960 --> 1:57:23.440
 I can't believe you actually have it.

1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:25.360
 Well, it's also just like your people too.

1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:28.360
 And my people say, what do you write about?

1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:30.880
 Literally anything I find interesting.

1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:36.960
 And so for me, once you start a blog, like your entire worldview becomes, would this

1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:37.960
 be a good blog post?

1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:42.200
 Would this be, I mean, that's the lens I see everything through, but I'm constantly coming

1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:46.520
 across something or, you know, or just a tweet, you know, something that I'm like, ooh, I

1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:48.040
 need to like share this with my readers.

1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:53.760
 My readers to me are like my like, my friends who I'm like, I'm gonna, oh, I need to show

1:57:53.760 --> 1:57:55.400
 I need to tell them about this.

1:57:55.400 --> 1:57:58.120
 And so I feel like just a place to, I mean, I collect things in a document right now,

1:57:58.120 --> 1:58:01.000
 if it's like really good, but it's the little factoids and stuff like that.

1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:03.040
 I think, especially if I'm learning something, if I'm like,

1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:07.040
 So the problem is when you say stuff, when you look at it, a tweet and all that kind

1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:12.440
 of stuff is you also need to couple that with a system for review, because what Anki does

1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:16.640
 is like literally it determines for me, I don't have to do anything.

1:58:16.640 --> 1:58:18.760
 There's this giant pile of things I've saved.

1:58:18.760 --> 1:58:27.640
 And it brings up to me, okay, here's, I don't know, when Churchill did something, right?

1:58:27.640 --> 1:58:31.520
 I'm reading about World War II a lot now, like a particular event.

1:58:31.520 --> 1:58:32.520
 Here's that.

1:58:32.520 --> 1:58:34.040
 Do you remember when, what year that happened?

1:58:34.040 --> 1:58:40.680
 And you say yes or no, or like you get to pick, you get to see the answer and you get

1:58:40.680 --> 1:58:43.280
 to self evaluate how well you remember that fact.

1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:46.640
 And if you remember, well, it'll be another month before you see it again.

1:58:46.640 --> 1:58:49.040
 If you don't remember, it'll bring it up again.

1:58:49.040 --> 1:58:52.400
 That's a way to review tweets, to review concepts.

1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:56.720
 And it offloads the kind of, the process of selecting which parts you're supposed to

1:58:56.720 --> 1:58:57.720
 review or not.

1:58:57.720 --> 1:58:58.720
 And you can grow that library.

1:58:58.720 --> 1:59:04.160
 I mean, obviously medical students use it for like tens of thousands of facts.

1:59:04.160 --> 1:59:05.160
 It just gamifies it too.

1:59:05.160 --> 1:59:09.640
 It's like you can passively sit back and just, and the thing will like make sure you eventually

1:59:09.640 --> 1:59:15.360
 learn it all versus, you know, you don't have to be the executive calling that like the program,

1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:17.480
 the memorization program someone else is handling.

1:59:17.480 --> 1:59:22.480
 I would love to, to hear about like you trying it out or space repetition is an idea.

1:59:22.480 --> 1:59:26.320
 There's a few other apps, but Anki is the big, I totally want to try.

1:59:26.320 --> 1:59:30.560
 You've written and spoken quite a bit about procrastination.

1:59:30.560 --> 1:59:37.760
 I like you suffer from procrastination, like many other people suffering quotes.

1:59:37.760 --> 1:59:39.720
 How do we avoid procrastination?

1:59:39.720 --> 1:59:43.600
 I don't think the suffer is in quotes.

1:59:43.600 --> 1:59:50.880
 I think that's a huge part of the problem is that it's treated like a silly problem.

1:59:50.880 --> 1:59:58.000
 People don't take it seriously as a dire problem, but it can be.

1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:03.520
 It can ruin your life.

2:00:03.520 --> 2:00:11.480
 There's like, we talked about the compiling concept with, you know, if you read a little,

2:00:11.480 --> 2:00:16.200
 you know, you, okay, if you write, if you write two pages a week, you write a book every

2:00:16.200 --> 2:00:18.520
 two years, you're a prolific writer, right?

2:00:18.520 --> 2:00:22.120
 And the difference between, you know, again, it's not that, that that person's working

2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:26.040
 so hard is that they have the ability to, when they commit to something like on Sunday

2:00:26.040 --> 2:00:27.880
 mornings, I'm going to write two pages.

2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:29.560
 That's it.

2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:36.000
 They, they respect, they have enough, they have, they respect the part of them that made

2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:39.840
 that decision is, is a respected character in their brain.

2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:43.040
 And they say, well, that's, I decided it, so I'm going to do it.

2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:47.000
 The procrastinator won't do those two pages.

2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.120
 That's just exactly the kind of thing the procrastinator will keep on their list and

2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:51.120
 they will not do.

2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:54.560
 But the, it doesn't mean they're any less talented than the writer who does the two

2:00:54.560 --> 2:00:55.560
 pages.

2:00:55.560 --> 2:00:57.800
 It doesn't mean they want it any less.

2:00:57.800 --> 2:00:59.000
 Maybe they want it even more.

2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:02.720
 And it doesn't mean that they wouldn't be just as happy having done it as the writer

2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:03.720
 who does it.

2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:09.120
 So what they're missing out on, picture a writer who writes 10 books, you know, bestsellers

2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:15.280
 and they go on these book tours and, you know, they, and they just, they're so gratified

2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:20.560
 with their career and, you know, and they think about what the other person is missing

2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:23.600
 who does none of that, right?

2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:27.920
 So that, that is a massive loss, a massive loss.

2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:33.840
 And it's because the internal mechanism in their brain is not doing what the other person's

2:01:33.840 --> 2:01:34.840
 is.

2:01:34.840 --> 2:01:38.080
 So they don't have the respect for the, the part of them that made the, the choice.

2:01:38.080 --> 2:01:40.160
 They feel like it's someone they can disregard.

2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:46.440
 And so to me, is this in the same boat as someone who is obese because they're eating

2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:52.920
 habits, make them obese over time or their exercise habits, um, that, you know, that's

2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:54.360
 a huge loss for that person.

2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:58.040
 That person is, is, is, you know, the health problems and it's just probably making them

2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:00.040
 miserable.

2:02:00.040 --> 2:02:02.000
 And it's, and it's self inflicted, right?

2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:06.520
 It's self defeating, but that doesn't make an easy problem to fix just because you're

2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:07.600
 doing it to yourself.

2:02:07.600 --> 2:02:11.400
 So to me, procrastination is another one of these where you are the only person in your

2:02:11.400 --> 2:02:12.400
 own way.

2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:16.880
 You are, you know, you are failing at something or not doing something that you really want

2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:17.880
 to do.

2:02:17.880 --> 2:02:19.120
 You know, it doesn't have to be work.

2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:22.920
 Maybe you're, you want to get out of that marriage that, you know, you realize it hits

2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:23.920
 you.

2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:24.920
 You shouldn't be in this marriage.

2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:27.680
 You should get divorced and you wait 20 extra years before you do it or you don't do it

2:02:27.680 --> 2:02:30.680
 at all.

2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:34.920
 That is, uh, you know, you're not living the life that, you know, you should be living,

2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:35.920
 right?

2:02:35.920 --> 2:02:38.000
 Uh, I think it's fascinating.

2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:42.400
 Now the problem is it's also a funny problem because there's short term procrastination,

2:02:42.400 --> 2:02:45.440
 uh, which I talk about as, you know, the kind that has a deadline.

2:02:45.440 --> 2:02:50.680
 Now, some people, you know, uh, this is when I bring in the, there's different characters.

2:02:50.680 --> 2:02:54.560
 There's the panic monster comes in the room and that's when you actually, you know, the

2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:57.880
 procrastinator can, um, there, there's different levels.

2:02:57.880 --> 2:03:03.640
 There's the kind that even when there's, um, a deadline, they, they stop panicking.

2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:06.520
 They just, they've given up and they, they really have a problem.

2:03:06.520 --> 2:03:09.200
 Then there's the kind that when there's a deadline, they'll do it, but they'll wait

2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:10.720
 to the last second.

2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:16.320
 Both of those people, I think have a huge problem once there's no deadline because, and most

2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:18.960
 of the important things in life, there's no deadline, which is, you know, changing your

2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:23.680
 career, uh, you know, becoming a writer when you never have been before, getting out of

2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:29.160
 your relationship, um, uh, you know, be doing whatever you need to, the changes you need

2:03:29.160 --> 2:03:31.320
 to make in order to get into a relationship.

2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:35.040
 There's a thing after launching a startup, launching a startup, right?

2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:38.400
 Uh, or once you're, once you've launched a startup, firing is the right someone that

2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:39.800
 needs to be fired, right?

2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:40.800
 Yes.

2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:43.480
 I mean, going out for fundraising and says, instead of just trying to, you know, there's

2:03:43.480 --> 2:03:49.320
 so many moments when the big change that you know, you should be making that would completely

2:03:49.320 --> 2:03:50.320
 change your life.

2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:53.280
 If you just did it, uh, has no deadline.

2:03:53.280 --> 2:03:56.120
 It just has to be coming from yourself.

2:03:56.120 --> 2:04:04.120
 And, um, I think that a ton of people have a problem where they will, they, they think

2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:05.800
 this delusion that, you know, I'm going to do that.

2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:09.480
 I'm definitely going to do that, you know, but not, not this week, not this month, not

2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:12.960
 today cause whatever, and they make this excuse again and again, and it just sits there on

2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:15.240
 their list collecting dust.

2:04:15.240 --> 2:04:20.760
 Um, and so yeah, to me it's, uh, it is a very real suffering.

2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:27.280
 And the fixes and fixing the habits just, uh, I'm still working on the fix.

2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:34.120
 First of all, so there, there's, okay, there is, um, there's just that you have a boat

2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:37.360
 that sucks and it's leaking and it's going to sink.

2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:41.680
 You can fix it with duct tape for a couple of, you know, for one ride or whatever.

2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:44.880
 Uh, that's not really fixing the boat, but you can get you by.

2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:47.760
 So there's duct tape solutions to me.

2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:51.560
 So the panic monster is the character that rushes into the room once the deadline gets

2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:55.760
 too close or once there's some scary external pressure, not just from yourself.

2:04:55.760 --> 2:04:58.400
 And that's a huge aid to a lot of procrastinators.

2:04:58.400 --> 2:05:02.160
 Um, again, there's a lot of people who won't, you know, do that thing.

2:05:02.160 --> 2:05:05.040
 They've been writing that book they wanting to write, but there's way fewer people who

2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:09.040
 will not show up to the exam, you know, most people show up to the exam.

2:05:09.040 --> 2:05:14.680
 So, um, that's because the panic monster is going to freak out if they don't.

2:05:14.680 --> 2:05:16.620
 So you can, then you can create a panic monster.

2:05:16.620 --> 2:05:19.960
 If you want to, you know, you really want to write music, you really want to become

2:05:19.960 --> 2:05:20.960
 a singer songwriter.

2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:27.360
 Well, book a venue, um, tell 40 people about it and say, Hey, on, you know, this day, two

2:05:27.360 --> 2:05:30.400
 months from now, come, come and see, I'm going to play you some of my songs.

2:05:30.400 --> 2:05:31.400
 You now have a panic monster.

2:05:31.400 --> 2:05:32.400
 You're going to write songs.

2:05:32.400 --> 2:05:33.400
 You're going to have to.

2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:34.400
 Right.

2:05:34.400 --> 2:05:38.320
 So, um, there's, there's, there's duct tape things, you know, you can do things, you

2:05:38.320 --> 2:05:42.040
 know, people do, there's, I've done a lot of this with a friend and I say, if I don't

2:05:42.040 --> 2:05:47.600
 get X done by a week from now, I have to donate a lot of money somewhere.

2:05:47.600 --> 2:05:48.600
 I don't want to donate.

2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:51.320
 And that's, you would put that in the category of duct tape solutions.

2:05:51.320 --> 2:05:52.320
 Yeah.

2:05:52.320 --> 2:05:54.880
 Because it, because it's not, why do I need that?

2:05:54.880 --> 2:05:55.880
 Right.

2:05:55.880 --> 2:05:58.480
 If I really had solved this, this is something I want to do for me.

2:05:58.480 --> 2:05:59.480
 It's selfish.

2:05:59.480 --> 2:06:03.040
 This is, I just literally just want to be selfish here and do the work I need to do to get the

2:06:03.040 --> 2:06:04.040
 goals I want to get.

2:06:04.040 --> 2:06:05.040
 Right.

2:06:05.040 --> 2:06:08.680
 There's, there's a month, all the incentives should be in the right place.

2:06:08.680 --> 2:06:12.420
 And yet if I don't say that, I will, it'll be a week from now and I won't have done it.

2:06:12.420 --> 2:06:13.420
 Something weird is going on.

2:06:13.420 --> 2:06:14.420
 There's some resistance.

2:06:14.420 --> 2:06:18.040
 There's some force that is prevent that is in my own way, right?

2:06:18.040 --> 2:06:21.000
 And so doing something where I have to pay all this money.

2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:22.000
 Okay.

2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:23.000
 Now I'll panic and I'll do it.

2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:24.000
 So that's duct tape.

2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:27.320
 Fixing their boat is something where I don't have to do that.

2:06:27.320 --> 2:06:33.160
 I just will do the things that I, again, it's not, I'm talking about super crazy work ethic.

2:06:33.160 --> 2:06:38.080
 Just like, for example, okay, I have a lot of examples because I have a serious problem

2:06:38.080 --> 2:06:40.240
 that I've been working on.

2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:43.600
 And in some ways I've gotten really successful at solving it and other ways I'm still, still

2:06:43.600 --> 2:06:44.600
 flandering.

2:06:44.600 --> 2:06:45.600
 Um, so.

2:06:45.600 --> 2:06:46.600
 Yeah.

2:06:46.600 --> 2:06:47.600
 The world's greatest duct taper.

2:06:47.600 --> 2:06:48.600
 Yes.

2:06:48.600 --> 2:06:49.840
 Well, I, I, I'm pretty good at duct taping.

2:06:49.840 --> 2:06:53.440
 I probably could be even better and I'm like, and I'm, and I'm, you're procrastinating and

2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:55.120
 becoming a better duct tape reader.

2:06:55.120 --> 2:06:56.120
 Literally.

2:06:56.120 --> 2:06:57.120
 Like, yes.

2:06:57.120 --> 2:06:58.120
 I, there's nothing.

2:06:58.120 --> 2:06:59.120
 I won't.

2:06:59.120 --> 2:07:01.000
 So here's what I know what I should do as a writer, right?

2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:03.000
 Very obvious to me is that I should wake up.

2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:06.680
 It doesn't have to be crazy on six a.m. or anything insane or I'm not going to be one

2:07:06.680 --> 2:07:10.560
 of those crazy people of 530 jogs.

2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:15.880
 I'm going to wake up at whatever, you know, 738, 830, and I should have a block, like

2:07:15.880 --> 2:07:23.720
 just say nine to noon where I get up and I just really quick make some coffee and write.

2:07:23.720 --> 2:07:27.960
 It's obvious because all the great writers in history did exactly that.

2:07:27.960 --> 2:07:29.520
 Some of them have done that.

2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:30.520
 That's common.

2:07:30.520 --> 2:07:31.520
 There's, there's some that I like these writers.

2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:35.040
 They do the late night sessions, but most of them, they do way to the session, but there's

2:07:35.040 --> 2:07:36.040
 a session.

2:07:36.040 --> 2:07:38.360
 There's most writers who write in the morning and there's a reason.

2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:41.200
 I don't think I'm different than those people.

2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:42.480
 It's a great time to write.

2:07:42.480 --> 2:07:43.840
 You're fresh, right?

2:07:43.840 --> 2:07:46.840
 Your ideas from the, the, from dreaming have kind of collected.

2:07:46.840 --> 2:07:49.840
 You have all, you know, new, new answers that you didn't have yesterday and you can just

2:07:49.840 --> 2:07:51.200
 go.

2:07:51.200 --> 2:07:58.200
 But more importantly, if I just had a routine where I wrote from 9 to noon, weekdays, every

2:07:58.200 --> 2:08:03.920
 week would have a minimum of 15 focused hours of writing, which doesn't sound like a lot,

2:08:03.920 --> 2:08:04.920
 but it's a lot.

2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:07.000
 15, 15, no, this is no joke.

2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:09.640
 This is, you know, you're not, your phone's away.

2:08:09.640 --> 2:08:10.760
 You're not talking to anyone.

2:08:10.760 --> 2:08:11.760
 You're not opening your email.

2:08:11.760 --> 2:08:14.240
 You are focused writing for three hours, five.

2:08:14.240 --> 2:08:16.680
 That's a big week for most writers.

2:08:16.680 --> 2:08:21.520
 So now what's happening is that every weekday is a minimum of a B. I'll give myself, you

2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:24.880
 know, an A might be, you know, wow, I really just got into a flow and wrote for six hours

2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:28.960
 and had, you know, great, but it's a minimum of a B. I can keep going if I want.

2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:31.600
 And every week is a minimum of a B with those 15 hours, right?

2:08:31.600 --> 2:08:34.320
 And if I just talk about compiling, if I, this is the two pages a week.

2:08:34.320 --> 2:08:39.320
 If I just did that every week, I achieve all my writing goals in my life.

2:08:39.320 --> 2:08:44.800
 And yet I wake up and most days I just either I'll revenge procrastination late at night

2:08:44.800 --> 2:08:47.600
 and go to bed way too late and then wake up later and get on a bad schedule and I just

2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:51.360
 fall into these bad schedules or I'll wake up and there's just, you know, I'll say, I'll

2:08:51.360 --> 2:08:54.760
 just do a few emails and I'll open it up and I'm suddenly on text and I'm texting in there

2:08:54.760 --> 2:08:57.720
 or I'll just go and, you know, I'll make a phone call and I'll be on phone calls for

2:08:57.720 --> 2:08:58.720
 three hours.

2:08:58.720 --> 2:08:59.720
 It's always something.

2:08:59.720 --> 2:09:00.720
 Yeah.

2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:03.480
 Or I'll start writing and then I hit a little bit of a wall, but because there's no sacred,

2:09:03.480 --> 2:09:05.280
 this is a sacred writing block.

2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:09.040
 I'll just hit the wall and say, well, this is icky and I'll go do something else.

2:09:09.040 --> 2:09:10.320
 So duct tape.

2:09:10.320 --> 2:09:15.400
 What I've done is their way, but why has one employee, Alicia, she's the manager of lots

2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:16.400
 of things.

2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:17.400
 That's her role.

2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:20.600
 She truly does lots of things.

2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:26.040
 And one of the things we started doing is either she comes over and sits next to me where

2:09:26.040 --> 2:09:29.400
 she can see my screen from nine to noon.

2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:30.400
 That's all it takes.

2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:32.840
 The thing about procrastination is usually they're not kicking and screaming.

2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:33.840
 I don't want to do this.

2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:37.000
 It's the feeling of, you know, in the old days when you had to go to class, you know,

2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:40.920
 your lunch block is over and it's like, oh, class in five minutes or it's Monday morning.

2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:45.200
 You go, oh, yeah, but you said, you know what, but you know, you go, you say, okay, and then

2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:47.120
 you get to class and it's not that bad once you're there.

2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:48.120
 Right.

2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:49.120
 It is.

2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:50.120
 You know, you have a trainer and he said, okay, next set.

2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:51.120
 And you go, okay.

2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:52.120
 And you do it.

2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:53.120
 That's all it is.

2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:56.320
 It's someone, some external thing being like, okay, I have to do this.

2:09:56.320 --> 2:09:59.120
 And then you have that moment of like, it sucks, but I guess I'll do it.

2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:02.720
 If no one's there though, the problem with the procrastinators, they don't have that person

2:10:02.720 --> 2:10:03.720
 in their head.

2:10:03.720 --> 2:10:06.920
 Other people I think were raised with a sense of shame if they don't do stuff and that stick

2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:09.680
 in their head is hugely helpful.

2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:11.160
 I don't really have that.

2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:14.400
 And so anyway, Alicia is sitting there next to me.

2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:18.280
 Now she's doing her own work, but she can see my screen and she of all people knows

2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:21.440
 exactly what I should be doing, what I shouldn't be doing.

2:10:21.440 --> 2:10:22.560
 That's all it takes.

2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:26.320
 The shame of just having her see me while she's sitting there not working would be just

2:10:26.320 --> 2:10:29.760
 too weird and too embarrassing, so I get it done and it's amazing.

2:10:29.760 --> 2:10:31.640
 It's like game changer for me.

2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:36.960
 So duct tape can solve, sometimes duct tape is enough, but I'm curious to, I'm still

2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:40.000
 trying to, what is going on?

2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:43.560
 I think part of it is that we are actually wired.

2:10:43.560 --> 2:10:48.280
 I think I'm being, I'm being very sane, human actually is what's happening or not sane is

2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:49.280
 not the right word.

2:10:49.280 --> 2:10:53.840
 I'm being like, I'm being a natural human that we are not programmed to sit there and

2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:59.760
 do homework of a certain kind, but we get the results like six months later.

2:10:59.760 --> 2:11:04.960
 That is not, so we're supposed to conserve energy and fulfill our needs as we need them

2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:07.160
 and do immediate things.

2:11:07.160 --> 2:11:12.120
 And we're overriding our natural ways when we wake up and get to it.

2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:15.920
 And I think sometimes because the pain, I think a lot of times we're just avoiding suffering

2:11:15.920 --> 2:11:20.720
 and a lot of people, the pain of not doing it is actually worse because they feel shame.

2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:24.240
 So if they don't get up and take a jog and get up early and get to work, I'll feel like

2:11:24.240 --> 2:11:28.240
 a bad person and that is worse than doing those things.

2:11:28.240 --> 2:11:31.760
 And then it becomes a habit eventually and it becomes just easy automatic, which becomes

2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:33.360
 I do it because that's what I do.

2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:37.680
 But I think that if you don't have a lot of shame necessarily, the pain of doing those

2:11:37.680 --> 2:11:42.360
 things is worse in that, in the immediate moment than not doing it.

2:11:42.360 --> 2:11:46.480
 But I think that there's this feeling that you've captured with your body language and

2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:53.440
 so on, I don't want to do another set, that feeling, the people I've seen that are good

2:11:53.440 --> 2:11:58.680
 at not procrastinating are the ones that have trained themselves to the moment they

2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:04.640
 would be having that feeling, it's like Zen, like Sam Harris style Zen, you don't experience

2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:05.640
 that feeling.

2:12:05.640 --> 2:12:06.640
 Yeah.

2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:07.640
 You just march forward.

2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:11.480
 Like I talked to Elon about this a lot actually offline, it's like he doesn't have this.

2:12:11.480 --> 2:12:12.920
 No, clearly not.

2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:18.640
 It's the way I think, he talks about it, the way I think about it is it's like you just

2:12:18.640 --> 2:12:24.720
 pretend you're like a machine running an algorithm, like you know this, you should be doing this.

2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:28.640
 Not because somebody told you so on, this is probably the thing you want to do, like

2:12:28.640 --> 2:12:32.960
 look at the big picture of your life and just run the algorithm, like ignore your feelings,

2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:33.960
 just run as if you.

2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:35.280
 Just framing, frame it differently.

2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:36.280
 Yeah.

2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:41.720
 Yeah, you can frame it as like, it can feel like homework or it can feel like you're living

2:12:41.720 --> 2:12:44.120
 your best life or something when you're doing your work.

2:12:44.120 --> 2:12:45.120
 Yeah.

2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:50.000
 Yeah, maybe reframe it, but I think ultimately is whatever reframing you need to do, you

2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:56.400
 just need to do it for a few weeks and that's how the habit is formed and you stick with

2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:57.400
 it.

2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:04.240
 Like I'm now on a kick where I exercise every day.

2:13:04.240 --> 2:13:09.520
 It doesn't matter what that exercise is, it's not serious, it could be 200 pushups, but

2:13:09.520 --> 2:13:14.600
 it's the thing that I make sure exercise every day and it's become way, way easier because

2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:20.400
 of the habit and I just, and I don't like, at least with exercise because it's easier

2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:22.040
 to replicate that feeling.

2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:25.520
 I don't allow myself to go like, I don't feel like doing this.

2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:26.520
 Right.

2:13:26.520 --> 2:13:28.600
 Well, I think about that even just like little things, like I brush my teeth before I go

2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:34.080
 to bed and it's just a habit and it is effort, like if it were something else, I would be

2:13:34.080 --> 2:13:36.720
 like, oh, I'm going to live in the bathroom, I'm going to do that and I'm just going to

2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:37.720
 lie down right now.

2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:41.920
 But it doesn't even cross my mind, it's just like that I just robotically go and do it

2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:43.680
 and it almost has become like a nice routine.

2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:45.000
 It's like, oh, this part of the night.

2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:48.640
 It's like a morning routine for me stuff is like, you know, that stuff is kind of just

2:13:48.640 --> 2:13:49.640
 like automated.

2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:54.400
 Yeah, it's funny because you don't like go, like, I don't think I've skipped many days.

2:13:54.400 --> 2:13:57.240
 I don't think I skipped any days brushing my teeth.

2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:01.200
 Like unless I didn't have a tooth part, like I was in the woods or something and what is

2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:02.200
 that?

2:14:02.200 --> 2:14:03.200
 Because it's annoying.

2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:08.480
 For me, the character that makes me procrastinate is the instant gratification monkey.

2:14:08.480 --> 2:14:09.800
 That's what I've labeled him, right?

2:14:09.800 --> 2:14:12.760
 And there's the rational decision maker and the instant gratification monkey and these

2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:14.280
 battle with each other.

2:14:14.280 --> 2:14:18.840
 But for a procrastinator, the monkey wins.

2:14:18.840 --> 2:14:23.720
 I think the monkeys, you know, you read about this kind of stuff, I think that this kind

2:14:23.720 --> 2:14:28.640
 of more primitive brain is always winning and in the non procrastinators, that primitive

2:14:28.640 --> 2:14:33.080
 brain is on board for some reason and isn't resisting.

2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:36.840
 But but when I think about brushing my teeth, it's like the monkey doesn't even think there's

2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:38.560
 an option to not do it.

2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:40.560
 So it doesn't even like get there's no hope.

2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:41.560
 Monkey has no hope there.

2:14:41.560 --> 2:14:44.440
 So it doesn't even like get involved and it's just like, yeah, you know, we have to just

2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:48.120
 like kind of like robotically just like, you know, it's kind of like Stockholm syndrome,

2:14:48.120 --> 2:14:50.960
 just like, oh, no, no, I have to do this.

2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:51.960
 It doesn't even like wake up.

2:14:51.960 --> 2:14:53.280
 It's like, yeah, we're doing this now.

2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:56.880
 For other things, the monkeys like, oh, no, no, no, most days I can win this one.

2:14:56.880 --> 2:15:03.440
 And so the monkey puts up that like fierce resistance and it's like, it's it's a lot

2:15:03.440 --> 2:15:05.760
 of it's like the initial transition.

2:15:05.760 --> 2:15:11.960
 So I think of it as like jumping in a cold pool where it's like, I will spend the whole

2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:15.960
 day pacing around the side of the pool in my bathing suit, just being like, I don't want

2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:18.800
 to have that one second when you first jump in and it sucks.

2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:22.680
 And then once you're once I'm in, once I jump in, I'm usually, you know, once I start writing,

2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:24.560
 I'm suddenly I'm like, oh, this isn't so bad.

2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:25.560
 Okay, I'm kind of into it.

2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:28.440
 Then sometimes you can't tear me away, you know, then I suddenly I'm like, I get into

2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:29.440
 a flow.

2:15:29.440 --> 2:15:33.560
 So it's like, once I get into cold water, I don't mind it, but I will spend hours standing

2:15:33.560 --> 2:15:35.160
 around the side of the pool.

2:15:35.160 --> 2:15:39.680
 And by the way, I do this in a more literal sense when I go to the gym with a trainer.

2:15:39.680 --> 2:15:42.040
 In 45 minutes, I do a full, full ass workout.

2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:47.520
 And it's not because I'm having a good time, but it's, it's, it's because it's that, okay,

2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:49.200
 I have to go to class feeling, right?

2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:55.480
 But when I go to the gym alone, I will literally do a set and then dick around my phone for

2:15:55.480 --> 2:15:57.560
 10 minutes before the next set.

2:15:57.560 --> 2:15:59.720
 And I'll spend an over an hour there and do way less.

2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:03.800
 So it is the transition, once I'm actually doing the set, I'm never like, I don't want

2:16:03.800 --> 2:16:04.800
 to stop in the middle.

2:16:04.800 --> 2:16:05.800
 Now it's just like, I'm going to do this.

2:16:05.800 --> 2:16:06.800
 And I feel happy.

2:16:06.800 --> 2:16:07.800
 I just did it.

2:16:07.800 --> 2:16:10.480
 So it's something, there's something about transitions that is very, that's why procrastinators

2:16:10.480 --> 2:16:13.120
 are late a lot of places.

2:16:13.120 --> 2:16:17.440
 It's I will procrastinate getting ready to go to the airport, even though I know I should

2:16:17.440 --> 2:16:18.440
 leave at three.

2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:19.440
 So I cannot be stressed.

2:16:19.440 --> 2:16:22.720
 I'll leave at three 36 and I'll be super stressed.

2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:26.320
 Once I'm on the way to the airport immediately, I'm like, why didn't I do this earlier?

2:16:26.320 --> 2:16:28.320
 Now I'm back to on my phone doing what I was doing.

2:16:28.320 --> 2:16:31.400
 I just had to get in the damn car or whatever.

2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:35.600
 So yeah, there's some very, very odd irrational.

2:16:35.600 --> 2:16:36.600
 Yeah.

2:16:36.600 --> 2:16:40.440
 Like I was waiting for you to come and you said that you're running a few minutes late

2:16:40.440 --> 2:16:47.520
 and I was like, I was like, I'll go get a coffee because I can't possibly be the one

2:16:47.520 --> 2:16:48.520
 who's early.

2:16:48.520 --> 2:16:49.520
 Right.

2:16:49.520 --> 2:16:50.520
 I can't, I don't understand.

2:16:50.520 --> 2:16:55.320
 I'm always late to stuff and I know it's disrespectful in the eyes of a lot of people.

2:16:55.320 --> 2:16:56.320
 I can't help.

2:16:56.320 --> 2:16:58.280
 It's not, you know what I'm doing ahead of it?

2:16:58.280 --> 2:17:00.080
 It's not like I don't care about the people.

2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:04.240
 I'm often like, you know, for like this conversation, I'd be preparing more.

2:17:04.240 --> 2:17:05.240
 Right.

2:17:05.240 --> 2:17:08.800
 Like it's like, I obviously care about the person, but for some,

2:17:08.800 --> 2:17:13.320
 Yeah, it's interpreted as like, there are some people that like show up late because

2:17:13.320 --> 2:17:16.680
 they like, they kind of like that quality in themselves and that's a dick, right?

2:17:16.680 --> 2:17:20.500
 There's a lot of those people, but more often it's someone who shows up frazzled and they

2:17:20.500 --> 2:17:22.640
 feel awful and they're furious at themselves.

2:17:22.640 --> 2:17:23.640
 They're so regretful.

2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:24.640
 Exactly.

2:17:24.640 --> 2:17:25.640
 I mean, that's me.

2:17:25.640 --> 2:17:28.200
 And I mean, also, all you have to do is look at those people alone running through the

2:17:28.200 --> 2:17:29.200
 airport, right?

2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:30.200
 Yeah.

2:17:30.200 --> 2:17:31.200
 They're not being disrespectful to anyone there.

2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:33.520
 They just inflicted this on themselves, like,

2:17:33.520 --> 2:17:35.520
 This is hilarious.

2:17:35.520 --> 2:17:40.280
 You've tweeted a quote by James Baldwin saying, quote, I imagine one of the reasons people

2:17:40.280 --> 2:17:47.680
 cling to their hate so stubbornly is because they sense once hate is gone, they will be

2:17:47.680 --> 2:17:51.200
 forced to deal with the pain.

2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:55.760
 What has been a painful but formative experience in your life?

2:17:55.760 --> 2:17:58.920
 What's the flavor, the shape of your pain that fuels you?

2:17:58.920 --> 2:18:05.080
 I mean, honestly, the first thing that jumped to mind is my own like battles against myself

2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:07.760
 to get my work done because it affects everything.

2:18:07.760 --> 2:18:11.240
 When I, I just took five years in this book and granted it's a, it's a beast.

2:18:11.240 --> 2:18:14.520
 Like I probably would have taken two or three years, but it didn't need to take five.

2:18:14.520 --> 2:18:18.800
 And that was a lot of, not just, you know, not just that I'm not working, it's that I'm

2:18:18.800 --> 2:18:19.800
 over researching.

2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:23.920
 I'm making it, I'm adding in things I shouldn't because I'm perfectionist, you know, being

2:18:23.920 --> 2:18:25.720
 a perfectionist about like, Oh, well, I learned that.

2:18:25.720 --> 2:18:26.720
 Now I want to get it in there.

2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:30.760
 I know I'm going to end up cutting it later, just, you know, or, or I over outline, you

2:18:30.760 --> 2:18:33.680
 know, something, you know, trying to get it perfect when I know that's not possible.

2:18:33.680 --> 2:18:38.760
 It's making a lot of immature kind of, I'm not actually that much of a writing amateur.

2:18:38.760 --> 2:18:42.240
 I've written, including my old blog, I've been a writer for 15 years.

2:18:42.240 --> 2:18:43.240
 I know what I'm doing.

2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:46.000
 I could advise other writers really well.

2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:50.520
 And yet I do a bunch of amateur things that I know while I'm doing them is an, I know

2:18:50.520 --> 2:18:51.520
 I'm being an amateur.

2:18:51.520 --> 2:18:57.600
 So that A, it, it, it hurts the actual product to make, so you know, it'd be, it's waste

2:18:57.600 --> 2:18:59.600
 your, your precious time.

2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:05.560
 See, um, when you're mad at yourself and you're in a, in a negative, you know, self defeating

2:19:05.560 --> 2:19:10.120
 spiral, it almost inevitably will, you'll be less good to others.

2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:13.080
 Like, you know, I'll just, just, I used to, you know, early on in my life, you know,

2:19:13.080 --> 2:19:18.280
 in my now marriage, um, one of the things we always used to do is I used to plan mystery

2:19:18.280 --> 2:19:20.800
 dates, you know, New York city, great, great place for this.

2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:24.800
 I'd, I'd find some weird little adventure for us, you know, it could be anything.

2:19:24.800 --> 2:19:25.800
 And I wouldn't tell her what it was.

2:19:25.800 --> 2:19:29.160
 I said, I, I reserving you for Thursday night, you know, at seven, okay.

2:19:29.160 --> 2:19:31.640
 And it was such a fun part of our relationship.

2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:35.320
 Started writing this book and got into a really bad, you know, personal space where I was

2:19:35.320 --> 2:19:38.240
 like in my head, I was like, I can't do anything until this is done.

2:19:38.240 --> 2:19:39.240
 You know, like, no.

2:19:39.240 --> 2:19:44.320
 And I, and I just stopped like ever valuing like, like joy of any kind.

2:19:44.320 --> 2:19:47.600
 Like I was like, no, no, that's for when I'm done.

2:19:47.600 --> 2:19:50.480
 And that that's a trap or very quickly, you know, you know, because I always think, you

2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:53.000
 know, think it's going to be a six months away, but it actually five years later, I'm

2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:57.720
 like, wow, I really wasn't living fully for five years is not, you know, we don't live

2:19:57.720 --> 2:19:58.720
 very long.

2:19:58.720 --> 2:20:01.880
 Like talking about your prime decades, like that's like a sixth of my prime years.

2:20:01.880 --> 2:20:04.960
 Like, wow, like that's a huge loss.

2:20:04.960 --> 2:20:11.840
 So to me, that was excruciating and, you know, and it was a bad pattern, a very unproductive,

2:20:11.840 --> 2:20:15.800
 unhelpful pattern for me, which is I'd wake up in the morning in this great mood, great

2:20:15.800 --> 2:20:19.200
 mood every morning, wake up, thrilled to be awake, I have the whole day ahead of me.

2:20:19.200 --> 2:20:23.360
 I'm going to get so much work done today and but, you know, first I'm going to do all these

2:20:23.360 --> 2:20:24.720
 other things and it's all going to be great.

2:20:24.720 --> 2:20:30.600
 And then I end up kind of failing for the day with those goals, usually sometimes miserably,

2:20:30.600 --> 2:20:35.360
 sometimes only partially, and then I get in bed probably a couple of hours later than

2:20:35.360 --> 2:20:36.360
 I want to.

2:20:36.360 --> 2:20:40.360
 And that's when all of the real reality hits me suddenly.

2:20:40.360 --> 2:20:44.360
 So much regret, so much anxiety, furious in myself, wishing I could take a time machine

2:20:44.360 --> 2:20:49.520
 back three months, six months a year, or just even to the beginning of that day.

2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:53.160
 And just tossing and turning now, I mean, this is a very bad place.

2:20:53.160 --> 2:20:56.840
 That's why I said suffering procrastinators suffer in a very serious way.

2:20:56.840 --> 2:21:02.480
 So look, I know this probably sounds like a lot of first world problems and it is, but

2:21:02.480 --> 2:21:05.440
 it's real suffering as well.

2:21:05.440 --> 2:21:13.640
 So to me, it's painful because you're not being as good a friend or a spouse or whatever

2:21:13.640 --> 2:21:14.640
 as you could be.

2:21:14.640 --> 2:21:17.400
 You're also not treating yourself very well, you're usually not being very healthy in these

2:21:17.400 --> 2:21:18.400
 moments.

2:21:18.400 --> 2:21:21.480
 You're often and you're not being, I'm not being good to my readers.

2:21:21.480 --> 2:21:27.600
 So it's just a lot of this, and it feels like it's one small tweak away.

2:21:27.600 --> 2:21:30.400
 Sometimes it's like, that's why I said it's like, if you just suddenly are just doing

2:21:30.400 --> 2:21:33.840
 that nine to 12 and you get in that habit, everything else falls into place.

2:21:33.840 --> 2:21:35.520
 All of this reverses.

2:21:35.520 --> 2:21:40.560
 So I feel hopeful, but it's like, it is a, I have not figured, I haven't fixed the boat

2:21:40.560 --> 2:21:41.560
 yet.

2:21:41.560 --> 2:21:43.640
 I have some good duct tape though.

2:21:43.640 --> 2:21:47.920
 And you also don't want to romanticize it because it is true that some of the greats

2:21:47.920 --> 2:21:52.240
 in history, especially writers suffer from all the same stuff, like they, they weren't

2:21:52.240 --> 2:21:57.240
 quite a, I mean, you might only write for two or three hours a day, but the rest of

2:21:57.240 --> 2:22:00.120
 the day is often spent, you know, like kind of tortured.

2:22:00.120 --> 2:22:01.120
 But

2:22:01.120 --> 2:22:02.120
 Right.

2:22:02.120 --> 2:22:05.320
 This is the irrational thing is if I, if, if, and this goes for a lot of people's jobs,

2:22:05.320 --> 2:22:09.000
 people especially who work for themselves, you'd be a shock how much you could wake up

2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:13.920
 at nine or eight or seven or whatever, get to work and stop at one, but you're really

2:22:13.920 --> 2:22:17.000
 focused in those hours, one or two.

2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:23.080
 And do 25 really focused hours of stuff, product stuff a week, and then there's 112 waking

2:22:23.080 --> 2:22:24.080
 hours in the week.

2:22:24.080 --> 2:22:25.080
 Right.

2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:27.320
 So we're talking about 80 something hours of free time.

2:22:27.320 --> 2:22:31.000
 You can live, you know, if you're just really focused in your, you know, yin and yang of

2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:34.120
 your time, and that's, that's my goal is black and white time.

2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:39.960
 I really focused time and then totally like clean conscience, free time right now, I've

2:22:39.960 --> 2:22:40.960
 neither.

2:22:40.960 --> 2:22:41.960
 It's a lot of gray.

2:22:41.960 --> 2:22:43.800
 It's a lot of, I shouldn't be working, but I'm not, oh, I'm wasting this time.

2:22:43.800 --> 2:22:44.800
 This is bad.

2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:45.800
 And that's just massive.

2:22:45.800 --> 2:22:49.680
 So if you can just get really good at the black and the white.

2:22:49.680 --> 2:22:51.680
 So you just wake up and it's just like full work.

2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:54.760
 And then I think a lot of people could have like all this free time, but instead I'll

2:22:54.760 --> 2:22:55.760
 do those same three hours.

2:22:55.760 --> 2:22:58.960
 It's like you said, I'll do them really late at night or whatever after having tortured

2:22:58.960 --> 2:23:00.960
 myself the whole day and not had any fun.

2:23:00.960 --> 2:23:03.120
 It's not like I'm having fun.

2:23:03.120 --> 2:23:06.320
 I call it the dark playground, by the way, which is where you are when you know you should

2:23:06.320 --> 2:23:08.160
 be working, but you're doing something else.

2:23:08.160 --> 2:23:12.840
 It's, you're doing something fun on paper, but it's, it's never, it feels awful.

2:23:12.840 --> 2:23:14.640
 And so yeah, I spent a lot of time in the dark.

2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:18.360
 And you know, you shouldn't be doing it and you still do it and yeah.

2:23:18.360 --> 2:23:19.520
 It's not clean conscience fun.

2:23:19.520 --> 2:23:20.520
 It's bad.

2:23:20.520 --> 2:23:21.920
 It's, it's toxic.

2:23:21.920 --> 2:23:25.200
 And I think that it's, there's something about, you know, you're draining yourself all the

2:23:25.200 --> 2:23:26.200
 time.

2:23:26.200 --> 2:23:28.960
 And if you just did your focused hours and then if you actually have good clean fun, fun

2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:29.960
 can be anything.

2:23:29.960 --> 2:23:32.200
 Reading a book can be hanging out with someone who can be really fun.

2:23:32.200 --> 2:23:36.800
 You can go and do something cool in the city, you know, that is critical.

2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:39.080
 It's you're recharging some part of your psyche there.

2:23:39.080 --> 2:23:41.000
 And I think it makes it easier to actually work the next day.

2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:44.400
 And I say this from the experiences when I have had, you know, good stretches.

2:23:44.400 --> 2:23:46.760
 It's like, it's, you're, you know what it is?

2:23:46.760 --> 2:23:49.920
 It's like, you feel like you're fist pounding one part of your brain's fist pounding the

2:23:49.920 --> 2:23:50.920
 other part.

2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:52.680
 Like you're like, you're like, we got that.

2:23:52.680 --> 2:23:54.920
 Like we, we treat, we treat ourselves well.

2:23:54.920 --> 2:23:57.080
 Like this is how you're internally feel like I treat myself.

2:23:57.080 --> 2:23:58.440
 And it's like, yeah, no, of course it's work time.

2:23:58.440 --> 2:23:59.800
 And then later you're like, now it's play time.

2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:00.800
 And it's like, okay, back to work.

2:24:00.800 --> 2:24:04.360
 Cause, and you're in this very healthy, like parent child relationship in your head versus

2:24:04.360 --> 2:24:08.920
 like this constant conflict and like the kid doesn't respect the parent and parent

2:24:08.920 --> 2:24:09.920
 hates the kid.

2:24:09.920 --> 2:24:10.920
 And like, yeah.

2:24:10.920 --> 2:24:11.920
 And you're right.

2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:15.800
 And it always feels like it's like one fix away so that there's hope.

2:24:15.800 --> 2:24:21.640
 I mean, I, I guess, I mean, so much of what you said just brings so true.

2:24:21.640 --> 2:24:24.280
 I guess I have the same kind of hope.

2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:27.680
 But you know, this podcast is very regular.

2:24:27.680 --> 2:24:34.160
 I mean, I'm impressed like, and I think partially what, what there is a bit of a duct tape solution

2:24:34.160 --> 2:24:37.880
 here, which is you just, the, the, the, cause it's always easy to schedule stuff for the

2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:39.200
 future for myself, right?

2:24:39.200 --> 2:24:42.520
 Cause that's future Tim and future Tim is not my problem.

2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:45.000
 So I'll schedule all kinds of shit for future Tim.

2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:51.680
 And I will, um, and I will, uh, not then not do it, but in this case you can schedule podcasts

2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:52.680
 and you have to show up.

2:24:52.680 --> 2:24:53.680
 Yeah, you have to show up.

2:24:53.680 --> 2:24:54.680
 Right.

2:24:54.680 --> 2:24:55.680
 It seems like a good medium for procrastinating.

2:24:55.680 --> 2:24:58.000
 But this is not my, this is what I do for fun.

2:24:58.000 --> 2:24:59.000
 I know.

2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:03.040
 But at least this is the kind of thing, especially if it's not your main thing, especially it's

2:25:03.040 --> 2:25:04.040
 not your main thing.

2:25:04.040 --> 2:25:06.480
 It's the kind of thing that you would dream of doing and want to do and never do.

2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:11.200
 And I feel like your, your, your regular, you know, production here is a, is a sign

2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:13.120
 that something is working at least in this regard.

2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:14.120
 Yeah.

2:25:14.120 --> 2:25:17.160
 And this forgot, but this, I'm sure you have this same kind of thing with the pocket.

2:25:17.160 --> 2:25:20.400
 In fact, because you're going to be doing the podcast as possible, the podcast becomes

2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:22.840
 what the podcast is for me.

2:25:22.840 --> 2:25:24.560
 This is your procrastinate.

2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:27.840
 If you think about being 80 and if you can get into that person's head and look back

2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:32.400
 and be like, and just deep regret, you just, you know, yearning, you could do anything

2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:35.140
 to just go back and have done this differently.

2:25:35.140 --> 2:25:36.140
 That is desperation.

2:25:36.140 --> 2:25:37.200
 It's just, you don't feel it yet.

2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:38.840
 It's not in you yet.

2:25:38.840 --> 2:25:41.440
 The other thing you could do is if you have a partner, if you want to partner with someone,

2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:45.960
 now you could say, we meet these 15 hours every week and that point you're going to

2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:46.960
 get it done.

2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:48.480
 So working with someone can help.

2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:49.480
 Yeah.

2:25:49.480 --> 2:25:53.400
 That's why they say like a co founder is really powerful for many reasons, but that's, that's

2:25:53.400 --> 2:25:54.400
 kind of one of them.

2:25:54.400 --> 2:26:01.560
 But because to actually, for the startup case, you, unlike writing, perhaps you, it's really

2:26:01.560 --> 2:26:03.280
 at like a hundred hour plus thing.

2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:08.840
 Like once you really launch, you, you go all in, like everything else just disappears.

2:26:08.840 --> 2:26:12.560
 Like you can't even have a hope of a balanced life for, for a little bit.

2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:15.480
 So, and there co founder really helps.

2:26:15.480 --> 2:26:16.640
 That's the idea.

2:26:16.640 --> 2:26:21.880
 Um, when you, you're one of the most interesting people on the internet.

2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:29.000
 So as a, as a writer, you look out into the future, do you dream about certain things

2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:30.520
 you want to still create?

2:26:30.520 --> 2:26:34.160
 Is there, um, is there projects that you want to write?

2:26:34.160 --> 2:26:38.760
 Is there movies you want to write or direct or endless?

2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:39.760
 So it's just endless.

2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:44.480
 See, no, there's, there's, there's specific list of things that really excite me, but

2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:47.480
 it's a big list that I know I'll never get through them all.

2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:51.960
 And that's part of why, um, the last five years really, like, you know, when I feel

2:26:51.960 --> 2:26:56.600
 like I'm not moving as quickly as I could, it bothers me because I have so much genuine

2:26:56.600 --> 2:27:00.120
 excitement to try so many different things and they get so much joy from finishing things.

2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:02.720
 I don't like doing things, but a lot of writers are like that.

2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:07.960
 I, I, I publishing something is greatly, is hugely joyful and makes it all worth it.

2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:10.800
 You know, or just finishing something you're proud of, putting it out there and have people

2:27:10.800 --> 2:27:11.800
 appreciate it.

2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:12.800
 It's like the best thing in the world.

2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:13.800
 Right.

2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:16.280
 You know, a lot of every kid makes some little bargain with themselves, has a little, you

2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:19.400
 know, a dream or, you know, something.

2:27:19.400 --> 2:27:23.800
 And I feel like when I'm, when I do something that I make something in this, you know, for

2:27:23.800 --> 2:27:27.640
 me, it's been mostly writing and I feel proud of it and I put it out there.

2:27:27.640 --> 2:27:31.000
 I feel like I like, again, I'm like fist pounding my seven year old self.

2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:35.480
 Like there's a little like, I'm, I like, I owe it to myself to do certain things and

2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:36.800
 I just did one of the things I owe.

2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:38.080
 I just paid off some debt to myself.

2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:40.240
 I owed it and I, and I paid it and it feels great.

2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:43.880
 It feels like very like, you just feel very, you know, a lot of inner peace when you do.

2:27:43.880 --> 2:27:47.440
 And so the more things I can do, you know, and I just have fun doing it, right?

2:27:47.440 --> 2:27:50.840
 And so I just, it's, it's, for me, that includes a lot more writing.

2:27:50.840 --> 2:27:53.400
 I just, you know, short, short, not short blog posts.

2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:56.920
 I write very long blog posts, but basically short writing in the form of long blog blog

2:27:56.920 --> 2:27:58.680
 posts is a great, I love that medium.

2:27:58.680 --> 2:28:01.040
 I want to do a lot more of that.

2:28:01.040 --> 2:28:02.040
 Books you have to be seeing.

2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:04.040
 I'm going to do this and I'm going to have another book I'm going to do right after.

2:28:04.040 --> 2:28:05.360
 And we'll see if I like those two.

2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:08.680
 And if I do, I'll do more otherwise I won't, but I also want to try other mediums.

2:28:08.680 --> 2:28:10.760
 I want to make more videos.

2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:14.480
 I want to, I did a little travel series once.

2:28:14.480 --> 2:28:15.480
 I love doing that.

2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:16.920
 I want to do, you know, more of that.

2:28:16.920 --> 2:28:23.520
 Almost like a vlog, like, no, I let readers in a survey pick five countries they wanted

2:28:23.520 --> 2:28:24.520
 me to go to.

2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:25.520
 That's awesome.

2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:27.920
 They picked, they picked, they sent me to weird places.

2:28:27.920 --> 2:28:32.400
 They sent me, I went to Siberia, I went to Japan.

2:28:32.400 --> 2:28:37.640
 I went from there to, this is all in a row, into Nigeria, from there to Iraq and from

2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:38.640
 there to Greenland.

2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:43.720
 And then I went back to New York, like two weeks in each place.

2:28:43.720 --> 2:28:46.840
 And I got to, you know, each one, I got to, you know, have some weird experiences.

2:28:46.840 --> 2:28:51.240
 I tried to like really dig in and have like, you know, some interesting experiences.

2:28:51.240 --> 2:28:54.960
 And then I wrote about it and I taught readers a little bit about the history of these places.

2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:56.280
 And it was just, I love doing that.

2:28:56.280 --> 2:28:57.280
 I love writing.

2:28:57.280 --> 2:29:01.920
 So, you know, and I'm like, oh man, like I haven't done one of those in so long.

2:29:01.920 --> 2:29:05.840
 And then, and then I have a big like desire to do fictional stuff.

2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:09.800
 Like I want to write a sci fi at some point, and I would love to write a musical.

2:29:09.800 --> 2:29:11.640
 That's actually what I was doing before Weep It Why.

2:29:11.640 --> 2:29:14.440
 I was, I was with a partner, Ryan Langer.

2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:19.720
 We were halfway through a musical and, and, and he got tied up with his other musical

2:29:19.720 --> 2:29:23.440
 and Weep It Why started taking off and we just haven't gotten back to it, but it's such

2:29:23.440 --> 2:29:24.440
 a fun medium.

2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:26.200
 It was such a silly medium, but it's so fun.

2:29:26.200 --> 2:29:30.600
 So you think about all of these mediums on which you can be creative and create something

2:29:30.600 --> 2:29:32.560
 and you like the variety of it.

2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:37.840
 Yeah, it's just, it's just that I, if there's a chance on, on a new medium, I could do something

2:29:37.840 --> 2:29:38.840
 good.

2:29:38.840 --> 2:29:39.840
 I want to, I want to do it.

2:29:39.840 --> 2:29:40.840
 I want to try it.

2:29:40.840 --> 2:29:42.560
 It sounds like so gratifying and so fun.

2:29:42.560 --> 2:29:43.560
 You know, like.

2:29:43.560 --> 2:29:45.640
 I think it's fun to just watch you actually sample these.

2:29:45.640 --> 2:29:47.680
 So I can't wait for your podcast.

2:29:47.680 --> 2:29:49.480
 I'll be listening to all of them.

2:29:49.480 --> 2:29:52.280
 I mean, that, that's a cool medium to see like where it goes.

2:29:52.280 --> 2:29:55.760
 The cool thing about podcasting and making videos, especially with a super creative mind

2:29:55.760 --> 2:30:01.000
 like yours, you don't really know what you're going to make of it until you try it.

2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:02.000
 Yeah.

2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:06.160
 Podcasts I'm really excited about, but I'm like, I like going on other people's podcasts

2:30:06.160 --> 2:30:08.320
 and I never tried having my own.

2:30:08.320 --> 2:30:12.200
 So there's this with every medium, there's the, the challenges of how the sausage is

2:30:12.200 --> 2:30:13.200
 made.

2:30:13.200 --> 2:30:16.760
 So like the challenges of the challenge of, yeah, but it's also, I'd like to like, I'll

2:30:16.760 --> 2:30:21.760
 go on like, as you know, long ass monologues and you can't do it on, if you're the interviewer,

2:30:21.760 --> 2:30:23.520
 like you're not supposed to do that as much.

2:30:23.520 --> 2:30:27.880
 So I have to like rein it in and, and that's, that can be, that might be hard, but we'll

2:30:27.880 --> 2:30:28.880
 see.

2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:29.880
 You could also do solo type stuff.

2:30:29.880 --> 2:30:30.880
 Yeah.

2:30:30.880 --> 2:30:31.880
 Maybe I'll do a little of each.

2:30:31.880 --> 2:30:32.880
 You know what's funny?

2:30:32.880 --> 2:30:36.200
 I mean, some of my favorite is more like solo, but there's like a side cake.

2:30:36.200 --> 2:30:41.720
 So you're, you're, you're having a conversation, but you're like friends, but it's really

2:30:41.720 --> 2:30:46.120
 you ranting, which I think, I think you'd be extremely good.

2:30:46.120 --> 2:30:47.120
 That's funny.

2:30:47.120 --> 2:30:48.120
 Yeah.

2:30:48.120 --> 2:30:49.120
 Or even if it's 50, 50, that's fine.

2:30:49.120 --> 2:30:54.360
 It's just a friend who I want to like really riff with, um, I just don't, um, I don't like

2:30:54.360 --> 2:30:57.640
 interviewing someone, which I won't, that's not what the podcast will be, but I can't

2:30:57.640 --> 2:30:58.640
 help.

2:30:58.640 --> 2:31:00.960
 I've tried moderating panels before and I cannot help myself.

2:31:00.960 --> 2:31:04.120
 I have to get involved and no one likes a moderator who's too involved.

2:31:04.120 --> 2:31:05.120
 It's very unappealing.

2:31:05.120 --> 2:31:08.840
 So I, um, you know, interviewing someone and I'm like, I can't, I don't even know.

2:31:08.840 --> 2:31:11.640
 I just, it's not my, I can grill someone, but that's different.

2:31:11.640 --> 2:31:13.720
 That's my curiosity being like, wait, how about this?

2:31:13.720 --> 2:31:14.720
 And I interrupt them.

2:31:14.720 --> 2:31:15.720
 And I'm trying.

2:31:15.720 --> 2:31:16.720
 I see the way your brain works.

2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:17.720
 It's hilarious.

2:31:17.720 --> 2:31:18.720
 It's awesome.

2:31:18.720 --> 2:31:19.720
 Yeah.

2:31:19.720 --> 2:31:20.720
 It's exciting.

2:31:20.720 --> 2:31:21.720
 Yeah.

2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:22.720
 I actually, I love listening.

2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:23.720
 I like watching people.

2:31:23.720 --> 2:31:24.720
 I like listening to people.

2:31:24.720 --> 2:31:25.720
 Yeah.

2:31:25.720 --> 2:31:28.040
 So this is like me right now having just listening to a podcast.

2:31:28.040 --> 2:31:29.720
 This is me listening to your podcast right now.

2:31:29.720 --> 2:31:32.840
 I love listening to a podcast because then it's not even like, but once I'm in the room,

2:31:32.840 --> 2:31:35.200
 I suddenly can't help myself jumping in.

2:31:35.200 --> 2:31:36.200
 Yeah.

2:31:36.200 --> 2:31:37.200
 Yeah.

2:31:37.200 --> 2:31:38.200
 Okay.

2:31:38.200 --> 2:31:39.200
 Um, big last ridiculous question.

2:31:39.200 --> 2:31:40.400
 What is the meaning of life?

2:31:40.400 --> 2:31:42.600
 The meaning of like an individual life?

2:31:42.600 --> 2:31:47.200
 Your existence here on earth or, or maybe broadly this whole thing we got going on,

2:31:47.200 --> 2:31:49.360
 the descendants of apes, um,

2:31:49.360 --> 2:31:50.360
 Visually creating.

2:31:50.360 --> 2:31:51.360
 Yeah.

2:31:51.360 --> 2:31:52.360
 Well, there's, yeah.

2:31:52.360 --> 2:31:55.600
 For, for me, I feel like, um, I want to be around as long as I can.

2:31:55.600 --> 2:31:59.600
 If I can, if I can do some kind of crazy life extension or upload myself, I'm gonna, because

2:31:59.600 --> 2:32:03.920
 who doesn't want to see how cool 20, uh, the year 3000 is imagine.

2:32:03.920 --> 2:32:06.120
 You did, you did say mortality was not appealing.

2:32:06.120 --> 2:32:08.240
 No, it's not appealing at all to me.

2:32:08.240 --> 2:32:12.560
 Now it's ultimately appealing as I said, no one wants eternal life, I believe.

2:32:12.560 --> 2:32:15.880
 If they understood what eternity really was, you know, I did Graham's number as a post

2:32:15.880 --> 2:32:18.440
 and I was like, okay, no one wants to live that many years.

2:32:18.440 --> 2:32:19.440
 But I'd like to choose.

2:32:19.440 --> 2:32:22.080
 I'd like to say, you know, I'm truly over it now and I'm gonna have, you know, at that

2:32:22.080 --> 2:32:25.760
 point we'd have our whole society would have like sit, we'd have a ceremony, we'd have

2:32:25.760 --> 2:32:29.320
 a whole process of someone signing off and, you know, it would be, it would be beautiful

2:32:29.320 --> 2:32:30.320
 and it wouldn't be.

2:32:30.320 --> 2:32:31.320
 Wow.

2:32:31.320 --> 2:32:33.600
 Well, I think you'd be super depressed by that point.

2:32:33.600 --> 2:32:35.600
 Like who's going to sign off when they're doing.

2:32:35.600 --> 2:32:36.600
 Maybe, maybe.

2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:37.600
 Yes.

2:32:37.600 --> 2:32:38.600
 Okay.

2:32:38.600 --> 2:32:39.600
 Maybe it's dark.

2:32:39.600 --> 2:32:40.600
 But at least, but the point is if I'm happy, I can stay around for five.

2:32:40.600 --> 2:32:42.720
 You know, my, I'm thinking 50 century sounds great.

2:32:42.720 --> 2:32:44.160
 Like, I don't know if I want more than that.

2:32:44.160 --> 2:32:47.480
 50, 50 sounds like a right number and so if you're thinking if you would sign up for

2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:50.600
 50, if you had a choice, one is what I get that is bullshit.

2:32:50.600 --> 2:32:55.000
 Like if you want, if you're somebody who wants 50, one is a hideous number.

2:32:55.000 --> 2:32:56.000
 Right.

2:32:56.000 --> 2:33:01.200
 You know, anyway, so for me personally, I want to be around as long as I can.

2:33:01.200 --> 2:33:05.640
 And then honestly, the reason I love writing, the thing that I love most is like, is like

2:33:05.640 --> 2:33:08.640
 a warm fuzzy connection with other people, right?

2:33:08.640 --> 2:33:13.280
 And that can be my friends and it can be readers and that's why I would never want to be like

2:33:13.280 --> 2:33:19.160
 a journalist where their personality is like hidden behind the writing or like even a biographer.

2:33:19.160 --> 2:33:22.800
 You know, there's a lot of people who are great writers, but it's, I like to personally

2:33:22.800 --> 2:33:23.800
 connect.

2:33:23.800 --> 2:33:26.600
 And if I can take something that's in my head and other people can say, oh my God, I think

2:33:26.600 --> 2:33:27.600
 that too.

2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:28.600
 And this made me feel so much better.

2:33:28.600 --> 2:33:29.600
 It made me feel seen.

2:33:29.600 --> 2:33:30.600
 Like that feels amazing.

2:33:30.600 --> 2:33:35.120
 And, and I just feel like we're all having such a weird common experience on this one

2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:40.800
 little rock in this one little moment of time where this weird, these weird four limb beings

2:33:40.800 --> 2:33:41.800
 and we're all the same.

2:33:41.800 --> 2:33:45.480
 And it's like, we're all, we all, the human experience, so I feel like so many of us suffer

2:33:45.480 --> 2:33:48.400
 in the same ways and we're all going through a lot of the same things.

2:33:48.400 --> 2:33:52.280
 And to me, it is very, if I lived, if I, it was on my deathbed and I feel like I had like

2:33:52.280 --> 2:33:56.880
 I had a ton of human connection and like shared a lot of common experience and made a lot

2:33:56.880 --> 2:34:01.560
 of other people feel like, like, not alone.

2:34:01.560 --> 2:34:03.400
 Do you feel that as a writer?

2:34:03.400 --> 2:34:10.520
 Do you like hear and feel like the inspiration, like all the people that you make smile and

2:34:10.520 --> 2:34:11.520
 all the people you inspire?

2:34:11.520 --> 2:34:15.480
 Honestly, not, sometimes, you know, when we did an in person event and I, you know, meet

2:34:15.480 --> 2:34:19.440
 a bunch of people and it's incredibly gratifying or, you know, you just, you know, you get

2:34:19.440 --> 2:34:22.760
 emails, but I think it is easy to forget that how many people that sometimes you're

2:34:22.760 --> 2:34:27.120
 just sitting there alone typing, yeah, dealing with your procrastination, but that's why

2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:30.560
 publishing is so gratifying because that's the moment when all this connection happens.

2:34:30.560 --> 2:34:34.560
 And especially if I had to put my finger on it, it's like, it's having a bunch of people

2:34:34.560 --> 2:34:38.280
 who feel lonely and they're like, the existence is all realized, like all, you know, connect,

2:34:38.280 --> 2:34:39.280
 right?

2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:43.360
 But if I do a lot of that, and that includes, of course, my actual spending, you know, a

2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:48.760
 lot of really high quality time with friends and family and like, and making the whole

2:34:48.760 --> 2:34:53.320
 thing as heartbreaking as like mortality and life can be, make the whole thing like fun

2:34:53.320 --> 2:34:56.880
 and at least we can like laugh at ourselves together while going through it.

2:34:56.880 --> 2:34:57.880
 Yeah.

2:34:57.880 --> 2:34:58.880
 And that to me is that, yeah.

2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:04.400
 And then your last blog post will be written from Mars as you get the bad news that you're

2:35:04.400 --> 2:35:07.800
 not able to return because of the malfunction in the rocket.

2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:08.800
 Yeah.

2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:11.480
 So go to Mars and like go there for a week and be like, yeah, here we are and then come

2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:12.480
 back.

2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:13.480
 No, I know that's what you want.

2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:14.480
 Staying there.

2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:15.480
 Yeah.

2:35:15.480 --> 2:35:18.200
 And that's fine, by the way, if I, if I, yeah, if, so you think you're picturing me

2:35:18.200 --> 2:35:21.560
 alone on Mars as the first person there and then it malfunctions.

2:35:21.560 --> 2:35:22.560
 Right.

2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:24.360
 No, you were supposed to return, but it malfunctions.

2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:31.080
 And then there's this, so it's both the hope, the awe that you experience, which is how the

2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:39.200
 blog starts and then it's the overwhelming like feeling existential dread, but then it

2:35:39.200 --> 2:35:41.240
 returns to like the love of humanity.

2:35:41.240 --> 2:35:42.240
 Well, that's the thing.

2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:43.240
 If I could be writing.

2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:44.240
 Yeah.

2:35:44.240 --> 2:35:46.400
 And actually like writing something that people would read back on earth, it would make it

2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:47.400
 feel so much better.

2:35:47.400 --> 2:35:48.400
 Yeah.

2:35:48.400 --> 2:35:50.400
 You know, if I were just alone and no one was going to realize what happened.

2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:51.400
 No, no, no.

2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:52.400
 You get to write.

2:35:52.400 --> 2:35:53.400
 Yeah.

2:35:53.400 --> 2:35:54.400
 No, no, no.

2:35:54.400 --> 2:35:55.400
 It's perfectly safe.

2:35:55.400 --> 2:35:56.400
 Also, that would bring out great writing.

2:35:56.400 --> 2:35:57.400
 Yeah, I think so.

2:35:57.400 --> 2:35:58.400
 Your deathbed on Mars alone.

2:35:58.400 --> 2:35:59.400
 I think so.

2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:00.400
 Yeah.

2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:01.400
 Yeah.

2:36:01.400 --> 2:36:02.400
 That's exactly the future I hope for you, Tim.

2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:03.400
 All right.

2:36:03.400 --> 2:36:04.400
 This was an incredible conversation.

2:36:04.400 --> 2:36:06.760
 You're a really special human being, Tim.

2:36:06.760 --> 2:36:10.160
 Thank you so much for spending a really valuable time with me.

2:36:10.160 --> 2:36:11.880
 I can't wait to hear your podcast.

2:36:11.880 --> 2:36:17.920
 I can't wait to read your next blog post, which you said in a Twitter reply.

2:36:17.920 --> 2:36:25.400
 You'll get more after the book, which add that to the long list of ideas to procrastinate

2:36:25.400 --> 2:36:26.400
 about.

2:36:26.400 --> 2:36:28.840
 Tim, thanks so much for talking to me.

2:36:28.840 --> 2:36:30.760
 Thank you.

2:36:30.760 --> 2:36:33.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tim Urban.

 And now let me leave you with some words from Tim Urban himself.

2:36:42.520 --> 2:36:48.800
 Be humbler about what you know, more confident about what's possible, and less afraid of

2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:51.800
 things that don't matter.

2:36:51.800 --> 2:37:01.800
 Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
