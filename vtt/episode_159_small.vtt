00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
 The following is a conversation with Richard Crape, founder of Numeri, which is a crowdsourced

00:06.400 --> 00:11.680
 hedge fund, very much in the spirit of Wall Street bets, but where the trading is done,

00:11.680 --> 00:17.680
 not directly by humans, but by artificial intelligence systems submitted by those humans.

00:18.240 --> 00:22.720
 It's a fascinating and extremely difficult machine learning competition

00:22.720 --> 00:28.320
 where the incentives of everybody is aligned, the code is kept and owned by the people who

00:28.320 --> 00:34.880
 develop it, the data, anonymous data is very well organized and made freely available.

00:35.520 --> 00:41.360
 I think this kind of idea has a chance to change the nature of stock trading and even just money

00:41.360 --> 00:48.880
 management in general by empowering people who are interested in trading stocks with the modern

00:48.880 --> 00:55.440
 and quickly advancing tools of machine learning. Quick mention of our sponsors, Audible Audiobooks,

 podcast. As a side note, let me say that this whole set of events around GameStop and Wall

01:13.360 --> 01:20.400
 Street bets has been really inspiring to me as a demonstration that a distributed system,

01:20.400 --> 01:26.800
 a large number of regular people are able to coordinate and collaborate in

01:27.520 --> 01:34.960
 taking on the elite centralized power structures, especially when those elites are misbehaving.

01:36.080 --> 01:41.920
 I believe that power in as many cases as possible should be distributed and in this case,

01:41.920 --> 01:49.520
 the internet as it is for many cases is the fundamental enabler of that power and at the core

01:49.520 --> 01:54.640
 what the internet and its distributed nature represents is freedom. Of course, the thing

01:54.640 --> 02:03.360
 about freedom is it enables chaos or progress or sometimes both. And that's kind of the point

02:03.360 --> 02:11.120
 of the thing. Freedom is empowering, but ultimately unpredictable. And I think in the end, freedom

02:11.120 --> 02:16.880
 wins. If you enjoy this podcast, subscribe on YouTube, review it on Apple Podcasts,

02:23.200 --> 02:30.160
 And now here's my conversation with Richard Kraeb. From your perspective, can you summarize the

02:30.160 --> 02:34.720
 important events around this amazing saga that we've been living through of Wall Street bets,

02:34.720 --> 02:39.760
 the subreddit and GameStop and in general, just what are your thoughts about it from

02:39.760 --> 02:44.640
 technical to the philosophical level? I think it's amazing. It's like my favorite story ever.

02:44.640 --> 02:53.040
 Like when I was reading about it, I was like, this is the best. And it's also connected with

02:53.040 --> 02:59.440
 my company, which we can talk about. But what I liked about it is I like decentralized coordination

02:59.440 --> 03:06.960
 and looking at the mechanisms that these are Wall Street bets users use to hype each other up,

03:06.960 --> 03:14.000
 to get excited, to prove that they bought the stock and they're holding. And then also to see

03:14.000 --> 03:21.040
 that how big of an impact that that decentralized coordination had. It really was a big deal.

03:21.040 --> 03:26.160
 Well, you're impressed by the distributed coordination, the collaboration amongst like,

03:26.160 --> 03:29.600
 I don't know what the numbers are, I know a numerized looking at the data.

03:30.320 --> 03:36.400
 After all of this is over and done, it'd be interesting to see like from a large scale

03:36.400 --> 03:41.200
 distributed system perspective to see how everything played out. But just from your current

03:41.200 --> 03:48.240
 perspective, what we know, is it obvious to you that such incredible level of coordination

03:48.960 --> 03:53.760
 could happen where a lot of people come together and distribute a sense there's an emergent behavior

03:53.760 --> 03:59.200
 that happens after that? No, it's not at all obvious. And one of the reasons is the lack of

03:59.200 --> 04:03.760
 kind of like credibility. To coordinate with someone, you need to kind of make credible

04:03.760 --> 04:12.080
 contracts or credible claims. So if you have a username on our Wall Street bets, like some of

04:12.080 --> 04:16.800
 them are like deep fucking value is one of them. That's an actual username. By the way,

04:16.800 --> 04:21.840
 we're talking about there's a website called Reddit and there's subreddits on it. And a lot

04:21.840 --> 04:28.400
 of people, most the anonymous, I think for the most part, anonymous can create user accounts and then

04:28.400 --> 04:32.560
 can then just talk on form like style boards. You should know what Reddit is. If you don't know

04:32.560 --> 04:40.320
 what Reddit is, check it out. If you don't know what Reddit is, maybe go to the subreddit first,

04:40.320 --> 04:45.040
 AWW with Q pictures of cats and dogs. That's my recommendation. Anyway. Yeah, that would be a

04:45.040 --> 04:50.800
 good start to Reddit. When you get into it more, go to our Wall Street bets. It gets dark quickly.

04:50.800 --> 04:57.520
 We'll probably talk about that too. So yeah, so there's these users and there's no contracts,

04:57.520 --> 05:02.480
 like you were saying. There's no contracts. The users are anonymous, but there are little things

05:02.480 --> 05:07.600
 that do help. So for example, if you've posted a really good investment idea in the past,

05:07.600 --> 05:14.000
 that exists on Reddit as well. And it might have lots of upvotes. And that's also giving

05:14.000 --> 05:24.720
 credibility to your next thing. And then they are also putting up screenshots. Here's the trades

05:24.720 --> 05:30.720
 I've made and here's a screenshot. Now you could fake the screenshot, but still, it seems like

05:30.720 --> 05:35.680
 if you've got a lot of karma and you've had a good performance on the community, it somehow

05:35.680 --> 05:41.280
 becomes credible enough for other people to be like, you know what? He actually probably did

05:41.280 --> 05:46.160
 put a million dollars into this. And you know what? I can follow that trade easily.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.160
 And there's a bunch of people like that. So you're kind of integrating all that information

05:50.160 --> 05:54.880
 together yourself to see like, huh, there's something happening here. And then you jump it onto this

05:54.880 --> 06:02.160
 little boat of behavior. We should buy the stock or sell the stock. And then another person jumps

06:02.160 --> 06:07.680
 on, another person jumps on. And all of a sudden you have just a huge number of people behaving

06:07.680 --> 06:12.400
 in the same direction. It's like flock of whatever birds. Exactly. What was strange with this one,

06:12.400 --> 06:18.720
 it wasn't just let's all buy Tesla. We love Elon. We love the Tesla. Let's all buy Tesla.

06:18.720 --> 06:24.800
 Because that we've heard before, right? Everybody likes Tesla. Now they do.

06:26.160 --> 06:31.760
 So what they did with this, in this case, they're buying a stock that was bad. They're buying it

06:31.760 --> 06:38.400
 because it was bad. And that's really weird, because that's a little bit too galaxy brain

06:38.400 --> 06:44.400
 for a decentralized community. How did they come up with it? How did they know that was the right

06:44.400 --> 06:50.320
 one? And the reason they liked it is because it had really, really high short interest. It had been

06:50.320 --> 06:57.760
 shorted more than its own float, I believe. And so they figured out that if they all bought this

06:57.760 --> 07:05.200
 bad stock, they could short squeeze some hedge funds. And those hedge funds would have to capitulate

07:05.200 --> 07:10.640
 and buy the stock at really, really high prices. And we should say that shorted means that these

07:10.640 --> 07:17.040
 are a bunch of people, when you short a stock, you're predicting that the stock is going to go

07:17.040 --> 07:22.160
 down and then you will make money if it does. And then what's the short squeeze?

07:22.160 --> 07:27.600
 It's really that if you are a hedge fund and you take a big short position in a company,

07:28.720 --> 07:35.360
 there's a certain level at which you can't sustain holding that position. There's no limit

07:35.360 --> 07:40.240
 to how high a stock can go, but there is a limit to how low it can go, right? So if you short

07:40.240 --> 07:46.640
 something, you have infinite loss potential. And if the stock doubles overnight, like GameStop did,

07:48.480 --> 07:53.600
 you're putting a lot of stress on that hedge fund. And that hedge fund manager might have to say,

07:53.600 --> 07:59.040
 you know what? I have to get out of the trade. And the only way to get out is to buy the bad

07:59.040 --> 08:05.280
 stock that they don't want, like they believe will go down. So it's an interesting situation,

08:05.280 --> 08:12.320
 particularly because it's not zero sum. If you say, let's all get together and make a bubble in

08:12.320 --> 08:19.920
 watermelons, you buy a bunch of watermelons, the price goes up, comes down again, it's a zero sum

08:19.920 --> 08:24.320
 game. If someone's already shorted a stock and you can make them short squeeze, it's actually

08:24.320 --> 08:29.520
 a positive sum game. So yes, some redditors will make a lot of money, some will lose a lot,

08:29.520 --> 08:36.800
 but actually the whole group will make money. And that's really why it's such a clever thing

08:36.800 --> 08:43.360
 for them to do. A couple to the fact that shorting, I mean, maybe you can push back, but to me,

08:43.360 --> 08:48.720
 always from an outsider's perspective, seemed, I hope I'm not using too strong of a word,

08:48.720 --> 08:54.160
 but it seemed almost unethical. Maybe not unethical. Maybe it's just an asshole thing to do.

08:54.160 --> 08:59.440
 It's okay. I'm speaking not from an economics or financial perspective. I'm speaking from

09:00.080 --> 09:05.440
 just somebody who loves, I'm a fan of a lot of people. I love celebrating the success of a lot

09:05.440 --> 09:13.760
 of people. And this is like the stock market equivalent of like haters. I know that's not

09:13.760 --> 09:18.320
 what it is. I know that there's efficient, you want to have an economy efficient mechanism for

09:18.320 --> 09:26.480
 punishing sort of overhyped, overvalued things. That's what shorting is designed for. But it just

09:26.480 --> 09:33.360
 always felt like these people are just because they're not just betting on the loss of the company.

09:33.360 --> 09:39.760
 It feels like they're also using their leverage and power to manipulate media or just to write

09:39.760 --> 09:45.440
 articles or just to hate on you on social media. Then you get to see that with Elon Musk and so on.

09:45.440 --> 09:54.320
 So this is like the man, so people like hedge funds that we're shorting are like the

09:55.520 --> 10:02.720
 sort of embodiment of the evil or just the bad guy, the overpowerful that's misusing their power.

10:02.720 --> 10:08.400
 And here's the crowd, the people that are standing up and rising up. So it's not just that they were

10:08.400 --> 10:14.720
 able to collaborate on Wall Street bets to sort of effectively make money for themselves.

10:14.720 --> 10:21.520
 It's also that this is like a symbol of the people getting together and fighting the centralized

10:21.520 --> 10:29.680
 elites, the powerful. I don't know what your thoughts are about that in general. At this stage,

10:29.680 --> 10:38.080
 it feels like that's really exciting that people have power, just like regular people have power.

10:38.080 --> 10:46.400
 At the same time, it's scary a little bit because just studying history, people can be manipulated

10:46.400 --> 10:55.120
 by charismatic leaders. And so just like Elon right now is manipulating, encouraging people to

10:55.120 --> 11:02.000
 buy Dogecoin or whatever. There can be good charismatic leaders and there can be bad charismatic

11:02.000 --> 11:08.720
 leaders. And so it's nerve wracking. It's a little bit scary how much power a subreddit can have to

11:09.520 --> 11:13.920
 destroy somebody because right now we're celebrating they might be attacking or

11:13.920 --> 11:19.840
 destroying somebody that everybody doesn't like. But what if they attack somebody that is actually

11:19.840 --> 11:28.960
 good for this world? And that's kind of the awesomeness and the price of freedom. It's like

11:28.960 --> 11:34.000
 it could destroy the world or it can save the world. But at this stage, it feels like, I don't

11:34.000 --> 11:40.080
 know, overall, when you sit back, do you think this was just a positive wave of emergent behavior?

11:40.080 --> 11:45.600
 Is there something negative about what happened? Well, yeah, the cool thing is they weren't doing

11:45.600 --> 11:53.840
 anything. The reddit people weren't doing anything exotic. It was a creative trade, but it wasn't

11:53.840 --> 12:01.840
 exotic. It was just buying the stock. Maybe they bought some options too. But it was the hedge fund

12:01.840 --> 12:09.840
 that was doing the exotic thing. So I like that. It's hard to say, well, we've got together

12:10.400 --> 12:15.280
 and we've pulled all our money together and now there's a company out there that's worth more.

12:16.240 --> 12:22.560
 What's wrong with that? But it doesn't talk about the motivations which is, and then we destroyed

12:22.560 --> 12:30.720
 some hedge funds in the process. Is there something to be said about the humor and I don't know,

12:30.720 --> 12:35.680
 the edginess, sometimes viciousness of that subreddit? I haven't looked at it too much,

12:36.400 --> 12:42.000
 but it feels like people can be quite aggressive on there. So is there...

12:44.560 --> 12:50.960
 What is that? Is that what freedom looks like? I think it does. Yeah, you definitely need to let

12:50.960 --> 12:57.120
 people... One of the things that people have compared it to is the Occupy Wall Street, which is,

12:57.120 --> 13:04.880
 let's say, some very sincere liberals, like 23 years old, whatever, and they go out with signs

13:04.880 --> 13:14.640
 and they have some case to make. But this isn't sincere, really. It's a little bit more nihilistic,

13:14.640 --> 13:22.000
 a little bit more YOLO, and therefore a little bit more scary because who's scared of the Occupy

13:22.000 --> 13:26.720
 Wall Street people with the signs? Nobody. But these hedge funds really are scared. I was scared

13:26.720 --> 13:35.360
 of the Wall Street bats people. I'm still scared of them. Yeah, the anonymity is a bit terrifying

13:35.360 --> 13:42.640
 and exciting. I don't know what to do. I've been following events in Russia, for example.

13:42.640 --> 13:47.520
 It's like there's a struggle between centralized power and the distributed. I mean, that's the

13:47.520 --> 13:54.240
 struggle of the history of human civilization, right? But this on the internet, just that you

13:54.240 --> 14:02.960
 can multiply people. Some of them don't have to be real. You can probably create bots. It starts

14:02.960 --> 14:10.240
 getting me as a programmer. I start to think, hmm, me as one person, how much cast can I create by

14:10.240 --> 14:18.640
 writing some bots? Yeah. And I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking that. I'm sure there's

14:18.640 --> 14:23.200
 hundreds, thousands of good developers out there listening to this, thinking the same thing.

14:23.760 --> 14:29.280
 And then as that develops further and further in the next decade or two, what impact does that have

14:29.280 --> 14:40.560
 on financial markets on just destruction of reputations or politics, the bickering of

14:40.560 --> 14:45.040
 left and right political discourse, the dynamics of that being manipulated by

14:46.720 --> 14:52.640
 people talk about Russian bots or whatever. We're probably in the very early stage of that, right?

14:52.640 --> 15:00.720
 Exactly. And this is a good example. Do you have a sense that most of Wall Street bets folks are

15:00.720 --> 15:05.200
 actually individual people, right? That's the feeling I have is they're just individual,

15:05.200 --> 15:10.080
 maybe young investors, just doing a little bit of an investment, but just on a large scale.

15:10.080 --> 15:14.160
 Yeah, exactly. The reason I found out, I've known about Wall Street bets for a while, but the

15:14.160 --> 15:18.800
 reason I found out about GameStop was this, I met somebody at a party who told me about it,

15:18.800 --> 15:23.200
 and he was like 21 years old, and he's like, it's going to go up 100% in the next one day.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.000
 That we're talking about in last year?

15:26.000 --> 15:33.040
 This was probably, no, this was a few days ago. It was like maybe two weeks ago or something.

15:34.160 --> 15:39.680
 So it was already high GameStop, but it was just strange to me that there was someone telling me

15:39.680 --> 15:49.040
 at a party how to trade stocks who was like 21 years old, and it started to look into it.

15:50.160 --> 15:56.240
 Yeah, and he did make, yeah, he made 140% in one day. He was right, and now he's

15:57.120 --> 16:01.040
 supercharged. He's a little bit wealthier, and now he's going to look, wait for the next thing,

16:01.040 --> 16:04.400
 and this decentralized entity is just going to get bigger and bigger.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.920
 And they're going to, together, search for the next thing. So there's thousands of folks like

16:07.920 --> 16:12.720
 him, and they're going to probably search for the next thing to attack. People that have power in

16:12.720 --> 16:20.160
 this world that sit there with power right now in government and in finance in any kind of position

16:20.160 --> 16:25.520
 are probably a little bit scared right now. And honestly, that's probably a little bit good.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.000
 It's dangerous, but it's good.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.400
 Yeah, it certainly makes you think twice about shorting. It certainly makes you think

16:32.400 --> 16:37.920
 it's right about putting a lot of money into a short. These funds put a lot into one or two

16:37.920 --> 16:45.280
 names, and so it was very, very badly risk managed. Do you think shorting is, can you speak at a

16:45.280 --> 16:51.200
 high level just for your own as a person? Is it good for the world? Is it good for markets?

16:52.000 --> 16:55.840
 I do think that the two kinds of shorting, evil shorting,

16:55.840 --> 17:04.160
 and chill shorting, evil shorting is what Melvin Capital was doing.

17:05.600 --> 17:10.800
 And it's like, you put a huge position down, you get all your buddies to also short it,

17:10.800 --> 17:17.520
 and you start making press and trying to bring this company down. And I don't think,

17:18.080 --> 17:23.200
 in some cases, you go out to fraudulent companies, say, this company is a fraud,

17:23.200 --> 17:27.600
 maybe that's okay. But they weren't even saying games up, they were just saying,

17:27.600 --> 17:31.760
 it's a bad company, and we're going to bring it to the ground, bring it to its knees.

17:33.600 --> 17:40.320
 A quant fund, like Numeri, we always have lots of positions, and we never have a position that's

17:40.320 --> 17:49.920
 like more than 1% of our fund. So we actually have right now 250 shorts. I don't know any of them,

17:49.920 --> 18:01.680
 except for one, because it was one of the meme stocks. But we shorting them not to make them go,

18:01.680 --> 18:05.840
 we don't even want them to go down necessarily. That doesn't sound a bit strange, I say that.

18:05.840 --> 18:15.280
 But we just want them to not go up as much as our longs. So by shorting a little bit,

18:15.280 --> 18:20.800
 we can actually go long more in the things we do believe in. So when we were going

18:20.800 --> 18:27.040
 long in Tesla, we could do it with more money than we had, because we'd borrow from banks

18:27.600 --> 18:34.480
 who would lend us money, because we had longs and shorts, because we didn't have market exposure,

18:34.480 --> 18:38.480
 we didn't have market risk. And so I think that's a good thing, because that means

18:39.600 --> 18:44.000
 we can short the oil companies and go along Tesla and make the future come forward faster.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.320
 And I do think that's not a bad thing. So we talked about this incredible distributed system

18:50.960 --> 18:55.840
 created by Wall Street Bets. And then there's a platform, which is Robinhood,

18:56.800 --> 19:00.560
 which allows investors to efficiently, as far as you can correct me if I'm wrong, but

19:01.200 --> 19:07.120
 there's those and there's others and there's numeri that allow you to make it accessible

19:07.120 --> 19:16.800
 for people to invest. But that said, Robinhood was in a centralized way applied its power to

19:16.800 --> 19:22.800
 restrict trading on the stock that we're referring to. Do you have a thought on actually the things

19:22.800 --> 19:29.840
 that happened? I don't know how much you were paying attention to the shadiness around the whole

19:29.840 --> 19:34.560
 thing. Do you think it was forced to do it? Was there something shady going on? What are

19:34.560 --> 19:40.800
 your thoughts in general? Well, I think I want to see the alternate history. I want to see the

19:40.800 --> 19:46.560
 counterfactual history of them not doing that. Not doing it. How bad would it have gotten for

19:46.560 --> 19:52.560
 hedge funds? How much more damage could have been done if the momentum of these short squeezes could

19:52.560 --> 20:01.120
 continue? What happens when there are short squeezes, even if they're in a few stocks,

20:01.120 --> 20:07.040
 they affect kind of all the other shorts, too. And suddenly brokers are saying things like,

20:07.040 --> 20:14.320
 you need to put a more collateral. So we had a short. It wasn't GameStop. Luckily, it was BlackBerry.

20:14.960 --> 20:19.680
 And it went up like 100% in a day. It was one of these meme stocks, super bad company. The AIs

20:19.680 --> 20:26.080
 don't like it. The AIs think it's going down. What's a meme stock? A meme stock is kind of a

20:26.080 --> 20:35.520
 new term for these stocks that catch memetic momentum on Reddit. And so the meme stocks were

20:35.520 --> 20:45.760
 GameStop, the biggest one. GameStunk, as Elon calls it, AMC. And BlackBerry was one. Nokia was one.

20:46.480 --> 20:51.920
 So these are high short interest stocks as well. So these are targeted stocks. Some people say,

20:51.920 --> 20:58.640
 oh, isn't it adorable that these people are investing money in these companies that are

20:59.440 --> 21:04.080
 nostalgic? It's like, you're going to the AMC movie theater. It's like nostalgic. It's like, no.

21:04.720 --> 21:08.880
 It's not why they're doing it. It's that they had a lot of short interest. That was the main thing.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.920
 And so there were high chance of short squeeze.

21:12.560 --> 21:16.640
 In saying, I would love to see an alternate history, do you have a sense that that

21:18.160 --> 21:20.800
 what is your prediction of what that history would have looked like?

21:20.800 --> 21:28.160
 Well, you wouldn't have needed very many more days of that kind of chaos to hurt hedge funds.

21:29.200 --> 21:37.920
 I think it's underrated how damaging it could have been. Because when your shorts go up,

21:39.200 --> 21:44.400
 your collateral requirements for them go up. It's similar to Robinhood. We have a prime broker

21:44.400 --> 21:52.640
 that said to us, you need to put up $40 per $100 of short exposure. And then the next day,

21:52.640 --> 21:57.680
 they said, actually, you have to put up all of it, 100%. And we were like, what?

21:59.280 --> 22:05.840
 But if that happens to all the short, all the commonly held hedge fund shorts,

22:05.840 --> 22:11.520
 because they're all kind of holding the same things, if that happens, not only do you have to

22:11.520 --> 22:19.600
 cover the short, which means you're buying the bad companies, you need to sell your good companies

22:20.160 --> 22:26.160
 in order to cover the short. So suddenly, all the good companies, all the ones that the hedge

22:26.160 --> 22:32.080
 funds like are coming down, and all the ones that the hedge funds hate are going up in a

22:32.960 --> 22:40.640
 cascading way. So I believe that if you could have had a few more days of GameStop doubling,

22:40.640 --> 22:44.960
 AMC doubling, you would have had more and more hedge fund deleveraging.

22:44.960 --> 22:50.480
 But so hedge funds, I mean, they get a lot of shit, but do you have a sense

22:51.200 --> 22:58.080
 that they do some good for the world? First of all, Wall Street Bets itself is a kind of distributed

22:58.080 --> 23:03.920
 hedge fund. Numerize a kind of hedge fund. So like a hedge fund is a very broad category.

23:03.920 --> 23:10.480
 I mean, if some of those were destroyed, would that be good for the world? Or would there be

23:10.480 --> 23:17.040
 coupled with the destroying the evil shorting? Would there be just a lot of pain in terms of

23:17.040 --> 23:22.880
 investment in good companies? Yeah. A thing I like to tell people if they hate hedge funds is

23:23.520 --> 23:28.800
 I don't think you want to rerun American economic history without hedge funds.

23:29.840 --> 23:35.200
 So on mass, they're good. Yeah, they're good. Yeah, you really wouldn't want to.

23:35.200 --> 23:40.560
 Because hedge funds are kind of like picking up, they're making liquidity right in stocks.

23:41.120 --> 23:48.160
 And so if you love venture capitalists, they're investing in new technology, it's so good.

23:48.160 --> 23:53.360
 You have to also kind of like hedge funds because they're the reason venture capitalists

23:53.360 --> 23:58.080
 exist because their companies can have a liquidity event when they go to the public markets.

23:58.960 --> 24:03.440
 So it's kind of essential that we have them. There are many different kinds of them.

24:03.440 --> 24:09.360
 I believe we could maybe get away with only having an AI hedge fund,

24:11.440 --> 24:16.160
 but we don't necessarily need these evil billions type hedge funds that make the

24:16.160 --> 24:20.080
 media and try to kill companies. But we definitely need hedge funds.

24:20.080 --> 24:30.640
 Maybe from your perspective, because you run such an organization and Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood,

24:30.640 --> 24:34.160
 sort of had to make decisions really quickly, probably had to wake up in the middle of the

24:34.160 --> 24:40.560
 night kind of thing. And he also had a conversation with Elon Musk on Clubhouse,

24:40.560 --> 24:46.880
 which I just signed up for. It was a fascinating, one of the great journalistic performances of

24:46.880 --> 24:53.200
 our time with Elon Musk. Pulitzer Prize for Elon. How hilarious would it be if he gets a Pulitzer

24:53.200 --> 25:00.640
 Prize? And then his Wikipedia would be like journalist and part time entrepreneur. Business

25:00.640 --> 25:08.480
 magnet. I don't know if you can comment on any aspects of that, but if you were with Vlad,

25:08.480 --> 25:12.560
 how would you do things differently? What are your just thoughts about his interaction with

25:12.560 --> 25:18.720
 Elon? How he should have played it differently? I guess there's a lot of aspects to this

25:18.720 --> 25:24.080
 interaction. One is about transparency. How much do you want to tell people about really what went

25:24.080 --> 25:34.080
 down? There's NDAs potentially involved. How much in private do you want to push back and say,

25:34.080 --> 25:39.120
 no, fuck you to centralize power, whatever the phone calls you're getting, which I'm sure he's

25:39.120 --> 25:44.320
 getting some kind of phone calls that might not be contractual. It's not contracts that are forcing

25:44.320 --> 25:50.480
 him, but he was being what do you call it, pressured to behave in certain kinds of ways

25:50.480 --> 25:56.240
 from all kinds of directions. What do you take from this whole situation?

25:56.240 --> 26:01.440
 I was very excited to see Vlad's response. It's pretty cool to have him talk to Elon.

26:01.440 --> 26:07.360
 And one of the things that struck me in the first few seconds of Vlad speaking was I was like,

26:07.360 --> 26:17.280
 is Vlad like a boomer? But here we are. He seemed like a 55 year old man talking to a

26:17.280 --> 26:23.040
 20 year old. Elon was like the 20 year old. And he's like the 55 year old man. You can see why

26:23.040 --> 26:28.880
 Citadel are NMR buddies, right? Like you can. You can see why. It's like this is a nice,

26:28.880 --> 26:34.800
 it's not a bad thing. It's like he's got a respectable professional attitude.

26:34.800 --> 26:41.680
 Well, he also tried to do like a jokey thing. No, we're not being ageist here, boomer.

26:42.560 --> 26:48.400
 But like a 60 year old CEO, Bank of America, would try to make a joke for the kids. That's

26:48.400 --> 26:52.560
 what Vlad's talking about. Exactly. Yeah. I was like, what is this? This guy's like,

26:52.560 --> 27:00.400
 what is he, 30? Yeah. And I'm like, this is weird. But I think maybe that's also what I like

27:00.400 --> 27:05.680
 about Elon's kind of influence on American business is like, he's super like anti the

27:05.680 --> 27:15.200
 professional. Why say 100 words about nothing? And so I liked how he was cutting in and saying,

27:15.200 --> 27:19.600
 Vlad, what do you mean spill the beans, bro? Yeah. So you don't have to be courteous. It's

27:19.600 --> 27:24.560
 like the first principle thinking is like, what the hell happened? Yes. And let's just talk

27:24.560 --> 27:33.200
 like normal people. The problem of course is, you know, for Elon, it's cost him, what is it,

27:33.200 --> 27:39.440
 tens of millions of dollars is tweeting like that. But perhaps it's a worthy price to pay,

27:39.440 --> 27:46.880
 because ultimately, there's something magical about just being real and honest, and just going

27:46.880 --> 27:51.760
 off the cuff and making mistakes and paying for them, but just being real. And then moments like

27:51.760 --> 27:59.120
 this, that was an opportunity for Vlad to be that. And it felt like he wasn't. Do you think we'll

27:59.120 --> 28:05.520
 ever find out what really went down if there was something shady underneath it all? Yeah. I mean,

28:06.560 --> 28:13.360
 it would be sad if nothing shady happened, but his presence made it shady. Sometimes I feel like

28:13.360 --> 28:19.840
 that would mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook. Sometimes I feel like, yeah, there's a lot of

28:19.840 --> 28:25.680
 shitty things that Facebook is doing. But sometimes I think he makes it look worse, by the way,

28:25.680 --> 28:31.440
 he presents himself about those things. Like I honestly think that a large amount of people at

28:31.440 --> 28:40.080
 Facebook just have a huge unstable chaotic system. And they're all not all, but mass are trying to

28:40.080 --> 28:44.800
 do good with this chaotic system. But the presentation is like, it sounds like there's a lot of

28:44.800 --> 28:51.680
 back room conversations that are trying to manipulate people. And there's something about

28:51.680 --> 28:57.040
 the realness that Elon has that it feels like CEO should have. And Vlad had that opportunity.

28:57.040 --> 29:01.440
 I think Mark Zuckerberg had that too, when he was younger. Younger. And somebody said,

29:01.440 --> 29:07.440
 you got to be more professional, man. You can't say, you know, lol to an interview. And then

29:07.440 --> 29:12.400
 suddenly he became like this distant person that was hot. I'd like, you'd rather have him make

29:12.400 --> 29:16.880
 mistakes, but be honest than be like professional and never make mistakes.

29:17.920 --> 29:24.880
 Yeah. One of the difficult hires, I think, is like marketing people or like PR people,

29:25.600 --> 29:31.120
 is you have to hire people that get the fact that you can say lol on an interview. Or,

29:32.880 --> 29:39.760
 you know, take risks as opposed to what the PR, I've talked to quite a few big CEOs and

29:39.760 --> 29:47.360
 the people around them are trying to constantly minimize the risk of like, what if he says the

29:47.360 --> 29:51.840
 wrong thing? What if she says the wrong thing? It's like, what? Like, be careful. It's constantly

29:51.840 --> 29:56.560
 like, ooh, like, I don't know. And there's this nervous energy that builds up over time with

29:56.560 --> 30:02.160
 larger, larger teams where the whole thing, like I visited YouTube, for example, everybody I talked

30:02.160 --> 30:09.520
 to at YouTube, incredible engineering, an incredible system, but everybody's scared. Like, let's be,

30:10.160 --> 30:15.920
 let's be honest about this like madness that we have going on of huge amounts of video that we

30:15.920 --> 30:21.360
 can't possibly ever handle. There's a bunch of hate on YouTube. There's this chaos of comments,

30:21.360 --> 30:26.720
 bunch of conspiracy theories, some of which might be true. And then just like this mess that we're

30:26.720 --> 30:32.720
 dealing with, and it's exciting, it's beautiful. It's a place where like democratizes education,

30:32.720 --> 30:37.920
 all that kind of stuff. And instead, they're all like, sitting in like, trying to be very polite

30:37.920 --> 30:41.680
 and saying like, well, we're just want to improve the health of our platform. Like,

30:44.560 --> 30:49.520
 all right, man, let's just be real. Let's, let's, let's both advertise how amazing this freaking

30:49.520 --> 30:54.480
 thing is. But also to say like, we don't know what we're doing. We have all these Nazis posting

30:54.480 --> 30:59.840
 videos on YouTube. We don't, we don't know how to like handle it. And just being real like that,

30:59.840 --> 31:04.160
 because I suppose that's just the skill. Maybe it can't be taught. But over time,

31:05.040 --> 31:09.200
 the, whatever the dynamics of the company is, it does seem like Zuckerberg and others get worn

31:09.200 --> 31:16.320
 down. They just get tired. They get tired of not being real, of not being real, which is sad.

31:16.320 --> 31:25.600
 So let's talk about Numeri, which is an incredible company system idea, I think, but good place to

31:25.600 --> 31:33.760
 start. What is Numeri and how does it work? So Numeri is the first hedge fund that gives away

31:33.760 --> 31:39.360
 all of its data. So this is like, probably the last thing a hedge fund would do, right? Why would

31:39.360 --> 31:45.760
 we give away a data? It's like giving away your edge. But the reason we do it is because we're

31:45.760 --> 31:54.320
 looking for people to model our data. And the way we do it is by obfuscating the data. So when you

31:54.320 --> 32:01.520
 look at Numeri's data that you can download for free, it just looks like a million rows of numbers

32:01.520 --> 32:07.120
 between zero and one. And you have no idea what the columns mean. But you do know that if you're

32:08.080 --> 32:13.840
 good at machine learning or have done regressions before, you know that I can still find patterns

32:13.840 --> 32:19.040
 in this data even though I don't know what the features mean. And the data itself is a time

32:19.040 --> 32:26.080
 series data. And even though it's obfuscated, anonymized, what is the source data like

32:26.080 --> 32:31.280
 approximately? What are we talking about? So we are buying data from lots of different data vendors.

32:32.240 --> 32:38.480
 And they would also never want us to share that data. So we have strict contracts with them.

32:38.480 --> 32:44.960
 So we only can, but it's the kind of data you could never buy yourself unless you had maybe

32:44.960 --> 32:50.720
 a million dollars a year of budget to buy data. So what's happened with the hedge fund industry is

32:51.360 --> 33:00.080
 you have a lot of talented people who used to be able to trade and still can trade. But now

33:00.080 --> 33:06.240
 they have such a data disadvantage, it would never make sense for them to trade themselves.

33:06.240 --> 33:10.960
 But Numeri, by giving away this obfuscated data, we can give them a really, really high quality

33:10.960 --> 33:17.360
 data set that would otherwise be very expensive. And they can use whatever new machine learning

33:17.360 --> 33:22.720
 technique they want to find patterns in that data that we can use in our hedge fund.

33:22.720 --> 33:27.120
 And so how much of a variety is there in underlying data? We're talking about,

33:28.400 --> 33:34.080
 I apologize if I'm using the wrong terms, but one is just like the stock price. The other,

33:34.080 --> 33:39.440
 there's options and all that kind of stuff like the, what are they called, order books or whatever.

33:41.120 --> 33:46.800
 Is there maybe other totally unrelated to directly to the stock market data,

33:48.960 --> 33:51.120
 natural language as well, all that kind of stuff?

33:51.120 --> 33:58.800
 Yeah, we were really focused on data that's specific to stocks. So things like,

33:58.800 --> 34:03.600
 you can have, every stock has a PE ratio. For some stocks, it's not as meaningful,

34:03.600 --> 34:09.360
 but every stock has that. Every stock has one year momentum, how much they went up in the last year.

34:10.480 --> 34:15.520
 But those are very common factors. But we try to get lots and lots of those factors that we

34:15.520 --> 34:24.480
 have for many, many years, like 15, 20 years history. And then the setup of the problem is

34:24.480 --> 34:29.040
 commonly in quant called like cross sectional global equity. You're not really trying to say,

34:29.040 --> 34:35.680
 I want, I believe the stock will go up. You're trying to say the relative position of this

34:35.680 --> 34:41.600
 stock in feature space makes it not a bad buy in a portfolio.

34:41.600 --> 34:46.640
 So it captures some period of time and you're trying to find the patterns, the dynamics,

34:47.200 --> 34:51.840
 captured by the data of that period of time in order to make short term predictions about

34:51.840 --> 34:56.400
 what's going to happen. Yeah. So our predictions are also not that short. We're not really

34:56.400 --> 35:02.640
 caring about things like order books and tick data, not high frequency at all. We're actually

35:02.640 --> 35:07.600
 holding things for quite a bit longer. So our prediction time horizon is about one month.

35:07.600 --> 35:11.760
 We end up holding stocks for maybe like three or four months. So I kind of believe that's a

35:11.760 --> 35:20.880
 little bit more like investing than kind of plumbing. To go long a stock that's mispriced

35:20.880 --> 35:26.640
 on one exchange and short on another exchange, that's just arbitrage. But what we're trying

35:26.640 --> 35:31.760
 to do is really know something more about the longer term future of the stock.

35:31.760 --> 35:38.480
 Yeah. So from the patterns, from these periods of time series data, you're trying to understand

35:38.480 --> 35:45.760
 something fundamental about the stock, not about deep value, about as big in the context of the

35:45.760 --> 35:50.960
 market as underpriced, overpriced, all that kind of stuff. So this is about investing. It's not

35:50.960 --> 35:57.040
 about just like you said, high frequency trading, which I think is a fascinating open question for

35:57.040 --> 36:02.640
 a machine learning perspective. But just to build on that, so you've anonymized the data

36:02.640 --> 36:12.880
 and now you're giving away the data. And then now anyone can try to build algorithms that make

36:12.880 --> 36:16.320
 investing decisions on top of that data or predictions on the top of that data.

36:16.320 --> 36:23.120
 Exactly. So what does that look like? What's the goal of that? What are the underlying

36:23.120 --> 36:28.240
 principles of that? So the first thing is, we could obviously model that data in house.

36:28.960 --> 36:37.200
 We can make an XGBoost model on the data and that would be quite good too. But what we're trying to

36:37.200 --> 36:45.040
 do is by opening it up and letting anybody participate, we can do quite a lot better

36:45.040 --> 36:51.120
 than if we modeled it ourselves. And a lot better on the stock market doesn't need to be

36:51.120 --> 36:57.120
 very much. It really matters the difference between if you can make 10 and 12% in an equity

36:57.120 --> 37:04.880
 market neutral hedge fund because usually you're charging 2% fees. So if you can do 2% better,

37:04.880 --> 37:10.320
 that's all your fees. It's worth it. So we're trying to make sure that we always have the

37:10.320 --> 37:14.800
 best possible model. As new machine learning libraries come out, new techniques come out,

37:14.800 --> 37:19.760
 they get automatically synthesized. If there's a great paper on supervised learning,

37:19.760 --> 37:23.440
 someone on Numeri will figure out how to use it on Numeri's data.

37:23.440 --> 37:32.000
 And is there an ensemble of models going on? Or is it more towards one or two

37:32.000 --> 37:39.360
 or three best performing models? So the way we decide on how to weight all of the predictions

37:39.360 --> 37:46.640
 together is by how much the users are staking on them, how much of the cryptocurrency that

37:46.640 --> 37:50.320
 they're putting behind their models. So they're saying, I believe in my model.

37:51.200 --> 37:56.480
 You can trust me because I'm going to put skin in the game. And so we can take the

37:56.480 --> 38:02.160
 stake weighted predictions from all our users, add those together, average those together.

38:02.160 --> 38:07.120
 And that's a much better model than any one model in the sum because

38:07.120 --> 38:11.120
 assembling a lot of models together is kind of the key thing you need to do in investing too.

38:12.240 --> 38:17.680
 Yeah. So you're putting, there's a kind of duality from the user from the perspective

38:17.680 --> 38:22.400
 of a machine learning engineer with your, it's both a competition, just a really interesting,

38:22.400 --> 38:29.280
 difficult machine learning problem. And it's a way to invest algorithmically.

38:30.960 --> 38:38.320
 But the way to invest algorithmically also is a way to put skin in the game that communicates to

38:38.320 --> 38:47.760
 you that you're the quality of the algorithm and also forces you to really be serious about the

38:47.760 --> 38:53.920
 models that you build. So it's like everything just works nicely together. Like, I guess one

38:53.920 --> 39:01.920
 way to say that is the interests are aligned. Exactly. Okay. So it's just like poker is not

39:01.920 --> 39:07.440
 fun when it's like for very low stakes, the higher the stakes, the more the dynamics of the system

39:07.440 --> 39:14.000
 starts playing out correctly. Like as a small side note, is there something you can say about

39:14.000 --> 39:22.000
 which kind, looking at the big broad view of machine learning today or AI, what kind of algorithms

39:22.880 --> 39:29.440
 seem to do good in these kinds of competitions at this time? Is there some universal thing you

39:29.440 --> 39:35.040
 can say like neural networks suck, recurrent neural networks suck, transformers suck, or they're

39:35.040 --> 39:41.840
 awesome, like old school, sort of more basic kind of classifiers are better. Is there some kind of

39:41.840 --> 39:46.480
 conclusions so far that you can say? There is. There definitely is something pretty nice about

39:46.480 --> 39:55.280
 tree models like XGBoost. And they just seem to work pretty nicely on this type of data. So out

39:55.280 --> 40:01.760
 of the box, if you're trying to come a hundredth in the competition or in the tournament, maybe you

40:01.760 --> 40:10.800
 would try to use that. But what's particularly interesting about the problem that not many

40:10.800 --> 40:16.960
 people understand, if you're familiar with machine learning, this typically will surprise you when

40:16.960 --> 40:24.800
 you model our data. So one of the things that you look at in finance is you don't want to be too

40:24.800 --> 40:35.600
 exposed to any one risk. Even if the best sector in the world to invest in over the last 10 years

40:35.600 --> 40:42.800
 was tech, it does not mean you should put all of your money into tech. So if you train a model,

40:42.800 --> 40:48.160
 it would say put all your money into tech. It's super good. But what you want to do is actually

40:48.160 --> 40:55.680
 be very careful of how much of this exposure you have to certain features. So on Numeri, what a

40:55.680 --> 41:03.120
 lot of people figure out is actually if you train a model on this kind of data, you want to somehow

41:03.120 --> 41:09.760
 neutralize or minimize your exposure to certain features, which is unusual because if you did

41:09.760 --> 41:19.840
 train a stop light or stop street detection on computer vision, your favorite feature,

41:19.840 --> 41:23.520
 let's say you have an auto encoder and it's figuring out, okay, it's got to be red and it's

41:23.520 --> 41:31.040
 got to be white, that's the last thing you want to reduce your exposure to. Why would you reduce

41:31.040 --> 41:35.680
 your exposure to the thing that's helping you model the most? And that's actually this counter

41:35.680 --> 41:41.280
 intuitive thing you have to do with machine learning on financial data. So reducing your

41:41.280 --> 41:47.680
 exposure would help you generalize the things that are, so basically financial data has a large

41:47.680 --> 41:53.680
 amount of patterns that appeared in the past and also a large amount of patterns that have not

41:53.680 --> 41:58.800
 appeared in the past. And so in that sense, you have to reduce the exposure to red lights,

41:58.800 --> 42:06.240
 to the color red. That's interesting, but how much of this is art and how much of it is science

42:06.240 --> 42:12.480
 from your perspective so far in terms of as you start to climb from the hundredth position to the

42:12.480 --> 42:22.400
 95th in the competition? Yeah, well, if you do make yourself super exposed to one or two features,

42:22.400 --> 42:28.320
 you can have a lot of volatility when you're playing numerite. You could maybe very rapidly

42:28.320 --> 42:35.600
 rise to be high if you were getting lucky. Yes. And that's a bit like the stock market.

42:35.600 --> 42:42.400
 Sure. Take on massive risk exposure, put all your money into one stock and you might make 100%,

42:42.400 --> 42:51.280
 but it doesn't in the long run work out very well. And so the best users are trying to

42:51.280 --> 43:00.080
 stay high for as long as possible and not necessarily try to be first for a little bit.

43:00.080 --> 43:06.960
 So to me, a developer, machine learning researcher, how do I like to participate in

43:06.960 --> 43:11.280
 this competition and how do others, which I'm sure there'll be a lot of others interested

43:11.280 --> 43:15.680
 in participating in this competition, what are, let's see, there's like a million questions,

43:15.680 --> 43:22.880
 but like first one is how do I get started? Well, you can go to numerite.ai, sign up,

43:23.440 --> 43:31.840
 download the data. And on the data is pretty small. In the data pack you download,

43:31.840 --> 43:38.640
 there's like an example script, Python script, that just builds a XGBoost model very quickly from

43:38.640 --> 43:46.960
 the data. And so in a very short time, you can have an example model. Is that a particular

43:46.960 --> 43:51.920
 structure? Like what is this model then submitted somewhere? So there needs to be some kind of

43:51.920 --> 43:57.840
 structure that communicates with some kind of API. Like how does the whole, how does your model,

43:57.840 --> 44:02.560
 once you've built, once you create a little baby Frankenstein, how does it then live in its...

44:02.560 --> 44:06.880
 Okay, well, we want you to keep your baby Frankenstein at home and take care of it. We

44:06.880 --> 44:14.560
 don't want it. Okay. So you never upload your model to us. You always only giving us predictions.

44:14.560 --> 44:19.040
 So we never see the code that wrote your model, which is pretty cool, that our whole hedge fund

44:19.040 --> 44:26.000
 is built from models where we've never ever seen the code. But it's important for the users because

44:26.000 --> 44:30.880
 it's their IP, why they want to give it to us. That's brilliant. So they've got it themselves,

44:30.880 --> 44:40.880
 but they can basically almost like license the predictions from that part. So what some users

44:40.880 --> 44:46.320
 do is they set up a compute server and we call numeric compute. It's like a little AWS kind of

44:46.320 --> 44:52.320
 image. And you can automate this process. So we can ping you. We can be like, we need more predictions

44:52.320 --> 45:00.240
 now. And then you send it to us. Okay, cool. So that's, is that described somewhere? Like what

45:00.240 --> 45:06.400
 the preferred is the AWS or whether another cloud platform, is there, I mean, is there sort of

45:06.400 --> 45:12.320
 specific technical things you want to say that comes to mind that is a good path for getting

45:12.320 --> 45:18.960
 started. So download the data, maybe play around, see if you can modify the basic

45:21.120 --> 45:28.800
 algorithm provided in the example. And then you what set up a little server on the AWS that then

45:28.800 --> 45:35.360
 runs this model and takes pings and then makes predictions. And so how does your own money

45:35.360 --> 45:40.400
 actually come into play doing the stake of cryptocurrency?

45:40.400 --> 45:47.200
 Yeah, so you don't have to stake. You can start without staking. And many users might try for

45:47.200 --> 45:53.520
 months without staking anything at all to see if their model works on the real life data, right?

45:53.520 --> 46:02.640
 And is not overfit. But then you can get numerair many different ways. You can buy it on,

46:03.280 --> 46:07.840
 you can buy some on Coinbase, you can buy some on Uniswap, you can buy some on Binance.

46:09.120 --> 46:13.040
 So what did you say this is? How do you pronounce it? So this is the numeri

46:14.080 --> 46:19.120
 cryptocurrency. Yeah, NMR. NMR. What's, you just say NMR?

46:19.120 --> 46:27.120
 It is technically called numerair. Numerair? I like it. Yeah. But NMR is simple. NMR, numerair.

46:27.120 --> 46:31.760
 Okay. So, and you could buy it, you know, basically anywhere.

46:31.760 --> 46:35.360
 Yeah. So it's a bit strange because sometimes people are like, is this like pay to play?

46:36.000 --> 46:42.400
 Right. And it's like, yeah, you need to put some money down to show us you believe in your model.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.840
 But weirdly, we're not selling you the cryptocurrency, like you can't buy the

46:45.840 --> 46:53.360
 cryptocurrency from us. Right. It's like, it's also, we never, if you do badly,

46:54.320 --> 46:59.920
 we destroy your cryptocurrency. Okay, that's not good, right? You don't want it to be destroyed.

46:59.920 --> 47:05.760
 But what's good about it is it's also not coming to us. Right. So it's not like we win when you

47:05.760 --> 47:10.640
 lose or something like, like we're the house, like we're definitely on the same team. Yes.

47:10.640 --> 47:14.000
 You're helping us make a hedge fund that's never been done before.

47:14.000 --> 47:19.120
 Yeah. So again, interests are aligned. There's no, there's no tension there at all, which is

47:19.120 --> 47:24.240
 really fascinating. You're giving away everything and then the IP is owned by sort of the code.

47:24.240 --> 47:30.880
 You never share the code. That's fascinating. So since I have you here, and you said a hundredth,

47:30.880 --> 47:38.560
 I didn't ask out of how many. So we'll just, but if I, if I then once you get started and you find

47:38.560 --> 47:47.440
 this interesting, how do you then win or do well, but also how do you potentially try to win if this

47:47.440 --> 47:51.680
 is something you want to take on seriously from the machine learning perspective, not from a

47:51.680 --> 47:57.440
 financial perspective? Yeah, I think the first of all, you want to talk to the community. People

47:57.440 --> 48:02.960
 are pretty open. We give out really interesting scripts and ideas for things you might want to

48:02.960 --> 48:10.800
 try. And, but you're also going to need a lot of compute probably. And so some of the best users

48:10.800 --> 48:16.640
 are, are, you know, actually the very first time someone won on Numeri, I would write them a personal

48:16.640 --> 48:21.760
 email. It's like, you know, you've won some money. We're so excited to give you $300. And then they

48:21.760 --> 48:29.040
 said, I spend way more on the compute. So this is fundamental machine learning problem first,

48:29.040 --> 48:34.080
 I think is this is one of the exciting things. I don't know full in how many ways you can approach

48:34.080 --> 48:42.800
 this. But really, this is less about kind of no offense, but like finance people finance minded

48:42.800 --> 48:49.440
 people. They're also I'm sure great people. But it feels like from the community that I've experienced,

48:49.440 --> 48:58.480
 these are people who see finance as a fascinating problem space, the source of data. But ultimately,

48:58.480 --> 49:03.440
 they're machine learning people or AI people, which is a very different kind of flavor of community.

49:03.440 --> 49:10.000
 And I mean, I should say to that, I'd love to participate in this and I will participate in

49:10.000 --> 49:14.240
 this. And I'd love to hear from other people, if you're listening to this, if you're a machine

49:14.240 --> 49:20.240
 learning person, you should participate in it and tell me, give me some hints, how I can do

49:20.240 --> 49:26.560
 well at this thing. Because this boomer, I'm not sure I still got it. But because some of it is,

49:26.560 --> 49:34.240
 it's like Kaggle competitions, like some of it is certainly set up ideas like research ideas,

49:34.880 --> 49:39.920
 you know, like fundamental innovation. But I'm sure some of it is like deeply understanding,

49:39.920 --> 49:45.680
 getting like an intuition about the data. And then like, a lot of it will be like figuring out

49:45.680 --> 49:49.920
 like what works like tricks. I mean, you could you could argue most of deep learning research

49:49.920 --> 49:57.120
 is just tricks on top of tricks. But there's a, some of it is just the art of getting to know

49:57.120 --> 49:59.600
 how to work in a really difficult machine learning problem.

50:00.400 --> 50:04.720
 And I think what's important, the important difference with something like a Kaggle competition

50:04.720 --> 50:10.800
 where they'll set up this kind of toy problem. And then they will be out of sample tests like,

50:10.800 --> 50:16.640
 hey, you did well out of sample. And this is like, okay, cool. But what's cool with Nimera is

50:16.640 --> 50:23.200
 you're, you're the out of sample is the real life stock market. We, we don't even know,

50:23.200 --> 50:27.600
 like we don't know the answer to the problem. We don't like, you'll have to find out live.

50:28.240 --> 50:33.280
 And so we've had users who've like submitted every week for, for like four years.

50:34.800 --> 50:41.200
 Because it's kind of a interest. We say it's the hardest data science problem on the planet,

50:41.200 --> 50:46.080
 right? And in that sense, maybe sounds like maybe a bit too much for like a marketing thing. But

50:46.080 --> 50:51.040
 it's the hardest because it's the stock market. It's like literally there are like billions

50:51.040 --> 50:57.440
 of dollars at stake and like no one's like letting it be inefficient on purpose. So if you can find

50:57.440 --> 51:02.000
 something that works on Nimera, you really have something that, that is like working on the real

51:02.000 --> 51:06.720
 stock market. Yeah, because there's like humans involved in the stock market. I mean, it's,

51:07.520 --> 51:11.280
 you know, you could argue that might be harder data sets that may be predicting the weather,

51:11.280 --> 51:16.400
 all those kinds of things. But the fundamental statement here is, which I like, I was thinking

51:16.400 --> 51:21.040
 like, is this really the hardest data science problem? And you start thinking about that,

51:21.040 --> 51:28.320
 but ultimately also boils down to a problem where the data is accessible, it's made accessible, made

51:28.320 --> 51:35.520
 really easy and efficient at like submitting algorithms. So it's not just, you know, it's

51:35.520 --> 51:40.400
 not about the data being out there, like the weather, it's about making the data super accessible,

51:40.400 --> 51:46.480
 making the ability to community around it. Like, this is what ImageNet did. Exactly. Like, it's

51:46.480 --> 51:51.920
 not just, there's always images. The point is, you aggregate them together, you give it a little

51:51.920 --> 51:59.840
 title, this is community and that, that was one of the hardest, right, for a time. And most important

51:59.840 --> 52:07.600
 data science problems in the world, because it was accessible because it was made sort of

52:07.600 --> 52:13.520
 like, there was a mechanisms by which like standards and mechanisms by which to judge your

52:13.520 --> 52:17.760
 performance, all those kinds of things and numerize access, step up from that. Is there

52:17.760 --> 52:24.080
 something more you can say about why from your perspective, it's the hardest problem in the

52:24.080 --> 52:28.560
 world? I mean, you said it's connected to the market. So if you can find a pattern in the market,

52:29.280 --> 52:33.280
 that's a really difficult thing to do because a lot of people are trying to do it.

52:33.280 --> 52:40.640
 Exactly. But there's also the, the biggest one is it's, it's non stationary time series. We've

52:40.640 --> 52:46.960
 tried to regularize the data so you can find patterns by, by doing certain things to the

52:46.960 --> 52:53.200
 features and the target. But ultimately, you're in a space where you don't, there's no guarantees

52:53.200 --> 53:01.840
 that the out of sample distributions will conform to any of the training data. And, and every single

53:01.840 --> 53:07.680
 era, which we call on the website, like every single era in the data, which is like sort of

53:07.680 --> 53:15.120
 showing you the order of the time. It's, it's even the training data is has the same, same

53:15.120 --> 53:22.160
 dislocations. And so, yeah, it's, and so, and then there's, you know, yeah, there's so many things

53:22.160 --> 53:28.160
 that might, might, you might want to try this, this like, there's unlimited possible number

53:28.160 --> 53:39.520
 of models, right? And so, by, by having it be open, we can at least search that space.

53:40.560 --> 53:45.840
 Zooming back out to the philosophical, you said that numeri is very much like Wall Street Pets.

53:47.360 --> 53:53.840
 Is there, I think it'd be interesting to dig in why you think so. I think you're speaking to the

53:53.840 --> 54:00.640
 distributed nature of the two and the power of the people nature of the two. And so, maybe can

54:00.640 --> 54:06.400
 you speak to the similarities and the differences and in which ways, numeri more powerful, in which

54:06.400 --> 54:11.680
 way is Wall Street Pets more powerful? Yeah, this is why the Wall Street Pets story is so interesting

54:11.680 --> 54:17.440
 to me because it's like feels like connected. Yeah. And looking at how just looking at the

54:17.440 --> 54:22.640
 forum of Wall Street Pets, it's, I was talking earlier about how, how can you make credible

54:22.640 --> 54:28.160
 claims? You're anonymous. Okay. Well, maybe you can take a screenshot. How, or maybe you can upvote

54:28.160 --> 54:34.080
 someone. Maybe you can have karma on Reddit. And those kinds of things make this emerging

54:34.080 --> 54:42.400
 thing possible. Numeri, it didn't work at all when we started. It didn't work at all. Why?

54:42.400 --> 54:46.960
 People made multiple accounts. They made really random models and hope they would get lucky.

54:46.960 --> 54:55.120
 And some of them did. Yes. Staking was our like solution to could we, could we make it so that

54:55.120 --> 55:01.680
 we could trust, we could know which model people believed in the most. And we could weight models

55:01.680 --> 55:09.040
 that had high stake more and effectively coordinate this group of people to be like, well, actually,

55:09.040 --> 55:14.720
 there's no incentive to creating bot accounts anymore. Either I stake my accounts, in which

55:14.720 --> 55:19.840
 case I should believe in them because I could lose my stake, or I don't. And that's a very powerful

55:19.840 --> 55:25.920
 thing that having a negative incentive and a positive incentive can make, can make things a

55:25.920 --> 55:31.280
 lot better. And staking is like this, is this really nice like key thing about blockchain.

55:31.280 --> 55:36.560
 There's like something special you can do where they don't even trusting us with their stake

55:36.560 --> 55:42.480
 in some ways. They're trusting the blockchain, right? So the incentives, like you say, it's about

55:42.480 --> 55:47.120
 making these perfect incentives so that you can have coordination to solve one problem.

55:47.760 --> 55:58.560
 And nowadays I, I sleep easy because I have less money in my own hedge fund than our users

55:58.560 --> 56:04.080
 are staking on their models. That's powerful. In some sense, from a human psychology perspective,

56:04.080 --> 56:11.120
 it's fascinating that the Wall Street bets worked at all, right? That the amidst that chaos,

56:11.120 --> 56:17.200
 emerging behavior, like behavior that made sense emerged, it would be fascinating to think if

56:17.200 --> 56:23.600
 numerized style staking could then be transferred to places like Reddit,

56:24.160 --> 56:29.760
 you know, and not necessarily for financial investments. But like, I wish sometimes people

56:30.960 --> 56:36.240
 would, you know, would have to stake something in the comments they make on the internet.

56:36.240 --> 56:42.000
 Yeah. Like that's, that's the problem with anonymity is like, anonymity is freedom and power

56:42.000 --> 56:47.200
 that you don't have to, you can speak your mind, but it's too easy to just be shitty.

56:48.880 --> 56:54.720
 Exactly. And so this, I mean, you're making me realize from like a profoundly philosophical

56:55.760 --> 57:02.160
 aspect, numerized staking is a really clean way to solve this problem. It's a really beautiful way.

57:02.160 --> 57:08.800
 Of course, it only with numeri currently works for a very particular problem, right? Not for human

57:08.800 --> 57:13.680
 interaction on the internet, but that's fascinating. Yeah, there's nothing for to stop people. In fact,

57:13.680 --> 57:21.440
 we've open sourced like the code we use for staking in a protocol we call erasure. And any, if Reddit

57:21.440 --> 57:28.320
 wanted to, they could even use that code to do have, have enable staking on our Wall Street bets.

57:28.320 --> 57:33.600
 And they're actually researching now, they've had some Ethereum grants on how could they have more

57:33.600 --> 57:40.640
 crypto stuff in there in Ethereum, because wouldn't that be interesting? Like imagine you could,

57:41.360 --> 57:48.880
 instead of seeing a screenshot, like, guys, I promise, I will not sell my GameStop. We're just

57:48.880 --> 57:57.360
 going to go huge. We're not going to sell at all. And here is a smart contract, which no one in the

57:57.360 --> 58:06.160
 world, including me, can undo. That says, my, I have staked millions against this claim.

58:07.840 --> 58:12.640
 That's powerful. And then what could you do? And of course, it doesn't have to be millions. It could

58:12.640 --> 58:17.760
 be just very small amount, but then just a huge number of users doing that kind of stake. Exactly.

58:19.360 --> 58:24.000
 That, you know, that could change the internet. It would change and the man Wall Street, it would

58:24.000 --> 58:27.440
 change Wall Street. They would not, they would never have been able to, they would still be

58:27.440 --> 58:31.760
 short squeezing one day after the next, every single hedge fund collapsing.

58:32.480 --> 58:38.320
 If we look into the future, do you think it's possible that Numeri style infrastructure,

58:38.880 --> 58:47.680
 where AI systems backed by humans are doing the trading, is what the entirety of the stock market

58:47.680 --> 58:55.520
 is, or the entirety of the economy is run by basically this army of AI systems with high level

58:55.520 --> 59:01.440
 humans supervision? Yeah, the thing is that some of them could be, could be bad actors.

59:02.480 --> 59:08.080
 Some of the humans? No, well, these systems could be tricky. So actually, I once met a

59:08.080 --> 59:12.640
 hedge fund manager. And this is kind of interesting. He said, very famous one. And he said,

59:12.640 --> 59:20.320
 um, we can see, sometimes we can see things in the market where we know we can make money,

59:20.320 --> 59:25.200
 but it will mess shit up. Yeah. We know we can make money, but it will mess things up.

59:25.200 --> 59:29.840
 And we choose not to do those things. And on the one hand, maybe this is like, oh,

59:29.840 --> 59:36.320
 you're being super arrogant. Of course you can't do this, but maybe he can. And maybe he really

59:36.320 --> 59:42.880
 isn't doing things he knows he could do, but would change, you know, be pretty bad.

59:43.440 --> 59:53.520
 Would the Reddit army have that kind of morality or concern for what they're doing?

59:53.520 --> 59:56.800
 Probably not, based on what we've seen. The madness of crowds.

59:57.440 --> 1:00:02.240
 There'll be like one person that says, hey, maybe, and then they get trampled over.

1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:06.160
 Uh, that's, that's the terrifying thing. Actually, this, uh,

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:11.680
 a lot of people have written about this is somehow that like little voice,

1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:16.480
 that's human morality gets silenced when we get in the groups and start chanting.

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:16.880
 Yeah.

1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:24.000
 And that's terrifying. But like, I think, uh, maybe I misunderstood. I thought that, um,

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:28.240
 you're saying AI systems can be dangerous, but you just describe how humans can be dangerous.

1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:35.200
 So which is safer? So, I mean, one thing is, uh, numerite, yeah. So wall street bets,

1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:40.400
 these kinds of like, these kinds of attacks, like it's not possible to, to model,

1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:46.880
 numerize data and then come up with the idea from the model, let short screen just game stop.

1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:51.360
 It's not even framed in that way. It's not like possible to have that idea.

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:56.320
 So, but it is possible for like kind of a bunch of humans. So I think there's,

1:00:56.320 --> 1:01:01.760
 it's, numerite could get very powerful, uh, without it being dangerous.

1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:06.560
 But wall street bets needs to get a little bit more powerful and it'll be pretty dangerous.

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:14.320
 Yeah. Well, I mean, uh, so this is a good place to kind of think about numerite data today,

1:01:15.360 --> 1:01:20.640
 and numerite signals and what that looks like in 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 years.

1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:25.040
 You know, like right now, I guess maybe you can correct me, but this,

1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:30.000
 the data that we're working with is like a window. It's a, you know, anonymized,

1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:35.920
 obfuscated window into a particular aspect, uh, time period of the market.

1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:41.040
 And, you know, you can expand that more and more and more and more potentially,

1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:47.040
 you can imagine in different dimensions to where it encapsulates all the things that, uh,

1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:53.440
 where you could, uh, include kind of human to human communication that was available for,

1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:57.520
 like, uh, to buy a GameStop, for example, on, on wall street bets.

1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:04.240
 So maybe the step back, can you speak to what is numerite signals and, uh,

1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:06.800
 what are the different data sets that are involved?

1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:14.240
 So with numerite signals, um, you're still providing, uh, predictions to us, um,

1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:17.360
 but you can do it from your own data sets.

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:22.560
 So numerites all, you have to model our data to come up with predictions.

1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:26.480
 Numerite signals is whatever data you can find out there,

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:29.680
 you can turn it into a signal and give it to us.

1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:34.480
 So it's a way for us to import signals on data we don't yet have.

1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:42.080
 And, um, and that's why it's particularly valuable because it's going to be signals.

1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:46.720
 You're only rewarded for signals that are orthogonal to our core signal.

1:02:46.720 --> 1:02:53.120
 So you have to be doing something uncorrelated and so strange alternative data tends to have

1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:53.920
 that property.

1:02:53.920 --> 1:02:59.920
 There isn't too many other signals that are correlated with, um, with, uh,

1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:02.080
 you know, what's happening on wall street bets.

1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:05.920
 That's not going to be like correlated with the price to earnings ratio, right?

1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:10.480
 Um, and we have some users as of recently, as of like a week ago,

1:03:10.480 --> 1:03:13.520
 there was a user that created, I think he's in India.

1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:19.520
 He created, um, a signal that is scraped from wall street bets.

1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:28.000
 Um, and now we have that signal, uh, as one of our signals in thousands that we use at numerite.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000
 And the structure of the signal is similar.

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.400
 So this is just numbers and time series data.

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:33.200
 It's exactly.

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:36.800
 And it's just like, it's kind of a, you're providing a ranking of stocks.

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:42.400
 So you just say, give a one means you like the stock, zero means you don't like the stock.

1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:45.760
 And you provide that for the 5,000 stocks in the world.

1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:50.320
 And they somehow converted the, the natural language that's in the wall street bet.

1:03:50.320 --> 1:03:50.800
 Exactly.

1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:51.520
 So they've come exactly.

1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:54.320
 So there's then they made, they open source this collab notebook.

1:03:54.320 --> 1:03:56.480
 Uh, you can go and see it and look at it.

1:03:56.480 --> 1:04:00.720
 And so yeah, it's taking that, making a sentiment score and then turning it into a

1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:05.920
 rank of, uh, like this stock sucks or this stock is awesome.

1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:08.000
 Uh, and then converting that's, that's fast.

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.560
 Just even looking at that data would be a fascinating.

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:17.040
 So on the signal side, what's the vision, this long term, what do you see that becoming?

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:20.480
 So we want to manage all the money in the world.

1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:22.080
 That's Numerize mission.

1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:28.240
 And to get that, we need to have all the data and have all of the talent.

1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:33.360
 Like there's no way for the first principles, if you had really good modeling and really

1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:35.840
 good data that you would lose, right?

1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:40.160
 Um, it's just a question of how much do you need to get, to get, to get the data?

1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:41.360
 To get really good.

1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:46.000
 So Numerize already has some really nice data that we give out this year.

1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.240
 We are 10 xing that.

1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:53.520
 And I actually think we'll 10 x the amount of data we have on Numerize every year for

1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:55.120
 at least the next 10 years.

1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:55.760
 Wow.

1:04:55.760 --> 1:05:02.640
 So it's going to get very big, the data we give out and signals is more data.

1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:08.960
 People with any other random data set can turn that into a signal and give it to us.

1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:12.720
 And in some sense, that kind of data is the edge cases, the weirdness is the,

1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:16.320
 so you're focused on like the bulk, like the main data.

1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:19.760
 And then there's just like weirdness from all over the place that just can enter through

1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:21.920
 this backdoor of the process.

1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:22.560
 Exactly.

1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:25.760
 And it's, it's also a little bit shorter term.

1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:33.200
 So the signals are about a seven day time horizon and the on Numerize, it's like a 30 day.

1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:38.400
 So it's often for faster situations.

1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:41.760
 You've written about a master plan and you've mentioned, which I love,

1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:49.520
 in a similar sort of style of big style thinking, you would like Numerize to manage all of the

1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:50.720
 world's money.

1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:58.640
 So how do we get there from, from yesterday to several years from now?

1:05:59.360 --> 1:06:01.120
 Like what's, what is the plan?

1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:05.120
 So you've already started to allure to it.

1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:11.760
 It's like get all the data and get all the talent, humans, models.

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:12.560
 Exactly.

1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:16.000
 I mean, the important thing to note there is what would that mean, right?

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:20.960
 And I think the biggest thing it means is like, if there was one hedge fund,

1:06:22.080 --> 1:06:27.600
 you would have not so much talent wasted on all the other hedge funds.

1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:30.240
 Like it's super weird how the industry works.

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:34.880
 It's like one hedge fund gets a data source and hires a PhD and another hedge fund

1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:37.440
 has to buy the same data source and hire a PhD.

1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:42.800
 And suddenly a third of American PhDs are working at hedge funds and we're not even on Mars.

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:49.600
 And like, so in some ways Numerize, it's all about freeing up people who work at hedge funds

1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:50.720
 to go work for Elon.

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:59.680
 Yeah. And also the people who are working on Numerize problem, it feels like a lot of the

1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:02.240
 knowledge there is also transferable to other domains.

1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:02.720
 Exactly.

1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:07.200
 One of our top users is, he works at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab.

1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:09.840
 And he's like amazing.

1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:14.560
 I went to go visit him there and it's like, he's got like Numerize posters and it's like,

1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:18.640
 it looks like, you know, the movies, like it looks like Apollo 11 or whatever.

1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:24.960
 Yeah. The point is, he didn't quit his job to join full time.

1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:29.760
 He's working on getting us to Jupiter's moon.

1:07:29.760 --> 1:07:31.840
 That's his mission, the Europa Clipper mission.

1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:33.440
 Actually, literally what you're saying.

1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:38.400
 Literally. He's smart enough that we really want his intelligence to reach the stock market.

1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:40.720
 Because stock market's a good thing, hedge funds are a good thing.

1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:42.160
 Our kinds of hedge funds, especially.

1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:45.440
 But we don't want him to quit his job.

1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:47.040
 So he can just do Numerize on the weekends.

1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:47.680
 And that's what he does.

1:07:47.680 --> 1:07:50.240
 He just made a model and it just automatically submits to us.

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:51.680
 And he's like one of our best users.

1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:56.160
 You mentioned briefly that stock markets are good.

1:07:56.160 --> 1:08:03.280
 For my sort of outsider perspective, is there a sense, do you think trading stocks

1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:09.440
 is closer to gambling or is it closer to investing?

1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:15.440
 Sometimes it feels like it's gambling as opposed to betting on companies to succeed.

1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:18.080
 And this is maybe connected to our discussion of shorting in general.

1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:22.640
 But from your sense, the way you think about it, is it fundamentally still investing?

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:27.440
 I do think, I mean, it's a good question.

1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:33.440
 I've also seen lately, people say, this is like speculation.

1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:35.600
 Is there too much speculation in the market?

1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:38.400
 And it's like, but all the trades are speculative.

1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:40.400
 Like all the trades have a horizon.

1:08:40.400 --> 1:08:42.080
 Like people want them to work.

1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:51.600
 So I would say that there's certainly a lot of aspects of gambling math

1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:53.760
 that applies to investing.

1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:58.960
 Like one thing you don't do in gambling is put all your money in one bet.

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:02.960
 You have bankroll management, and it's a key part of it.

1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:09.920
 And small alterations to your bankroll management might be better than improvements to your skill.

1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:14.960
 And then there are things we care about in our fund.

1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:17.360
 Like we want to make a lot of independent bets.

1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:18.960
 We talk about it.

1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:24.400
 We want to make a lot of independent bets because that's going to be a higher sharp

1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:27.520
 than if you have a lot of bets that depend on each other, like all in one sector.

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:40.480
 But yeah, the point is that you want the prices of the stocks to be reflective of their value.

1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:41.520
 Of the underlying value.

1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:47.280
 Yeah, you shouldn't have there be a hedge fund that's able to say, well,

1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:51.360
 I've looked at some data and all of this stuff is super mispriced.

1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:55.440
 That's super bad for society if it looks like that to someone.

1:09:55.440 --> 1:10:02.880
 I guess the underlying question then is, do you see that the market often drifts away from

1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:06.720
 the underlying value of companies and it becomes a game in itself?

1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:19.680
 What are these derivatives options and shorting and all that kind of stuff?

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:26.080
 It's like layers of game on top of the actual what you said, which is the basic thing that

1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:28.800
 the Wall Street Bets was doing, which is just buying stocks.

1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:33.760
 Yeah, there are a lot of games that people play that are

1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:36.880
 in the derivatives market.

1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:41.920
 And I think a lot of the stuff people dislike when they look at the history of what's happened,

1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:48.000
 they hate credit default swaps or collateralized debt obligations.

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:52.080
 Like these are the enemies of 2008.

1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:57.360
 And then the long term capital management thing, it was like that 30 times leverage

1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:05.680
 or something. You could just go to a gas station and ask anybody at the gas station,

1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:07.440
 is it a good idea to have 30 times leverage?

1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:08.720
 And they just say no.

1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:11.520
 It's a common sense just like went out the window.

1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:18.320
 I don't respect long term capital management.

1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:26.160
 But Numerain doesn't actually use any derivatives unless you call shorting derivative.

1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:28.640
 We do put money into companies.

1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:32.160
 That does help the companies we're investing in.

1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:33.280
 It's just in little ways.

1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:43.440
 We really did buy Tesla and we played some role in its success.

1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:46.480
 Super small, make no mistake.

1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:48.160
 But still, I think that's important.

1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:53.840
 Can I ask you a pothead question, which is what is money, man?

1:11:53.840 --> 1:12:01.920
 So if we just kind of zoom out and look at, because let's talk to you about cryptocurrency,

1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:03.680
 which perhaps could be the future of money.

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:07.520
 In general, how do you think about money?

1:12:07.520 --> 1:12:14.560
 You said Numerain, the vision, the goal is to run to manage the world's money.

1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:18.160
 What is money in your view?

1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:25.120
 I don't have a good answer to that, but it's definitely in my personal life,

1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:27.600
 it's become more and more warped.

1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:32.800
 And you start to care about the real thing.

1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:35.280
 What's really going on here?

1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:40.320
 Elon talks about things like this, like what is a company?

1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:40.720
 Really?

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:45.440
 It's like a bunch of people who kind of show up to work together and they solve a problem.

1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:49.760
 And there might be a stock out there that's trading that represents what they're doing,

1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:51.680
 but it's not the real thing.

1:12:52.880 --> 1:13:03.280
 And being involved in crypto, I put in crowd sale of Ethereum and all these other things,

1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:06.960
 and different crypto hedge funds and things that I've invested in.

1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:15.840
 And it feels like how I used to think about money stuff is just totally warped.

1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:24.720
 Because you stop caring about the price and you care about the product.

1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:30.160
 But the product, you mean the different mechanisms that money has exchanged?

1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:35.040
 Money is ultimately a kind of, one is the store of wealth,

1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:37.840
 but it's also a mechanism of exchanging wealth.

1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:42.480
 But what wealth means becomes a totally different thing,

1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:46.880
 especially with cryptocurrency, where it's almost like these little contracts,

1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:51.120
 these little agreements, these transactions between human beings that represent

1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:58.080
 something that's bigger than just cash being exchanged at 7.11, it feels like.

1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:00.400
 Yeah, maybe I'll answer what is finance.

1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:08.000
 It's what are you doing when you have the ability to take out a loan?

1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:14.160
 You can bring a whole new future into being with finance.

1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:20.160
 If you couldn't get a student loan to get a college degree,

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:23.840
 you couldn't get a college degree if you didn't have the money.

1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:30.560
 But now, weirdly, you can get it with, yeah, all you have is this loan,

1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:34.160
 which is like, so now you can bring a different future into the world.

1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:37.920
 And that's how, when I was saying earlier about, if you rerun American history,

1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:42.320
 economic history, without these things, you're not allowed to take out loans,

1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:45.600
 you're not allowed to have derivatives, you're not allowed to have money,

1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:48.800
 it just doesn't really work.

1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:53.200
 And it's a really magic thing, how much you can do with finance,

1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:55.360
 by kind of bringing the future forward.

1:14:55.920 --> 1:15:00.960
 Finance is empowering, we sometimes forget this, but yeah, it enables innovation,

1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:05.440
 it enables big risk takers and bold builders that ultimately make this world better.

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.680
 You said you were early in on cryptocurrency.

1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:14.320
 Can you give your high level overview of just your thoughts about the past,

1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:16.800
 present, and future of cryptocurrency?

1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:22.000
 Yeah, so my friends told me about Bitcoin and I was interested in

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:27.040
 equities a lot, and I was like, well, it has no net present value,

1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:31.760
 it has no future cash flows, Bitcoin pays no dividends.

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:37.520
 So I really couldn't get my head around it, that this could be valuable.

1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:44.240
 And then I, but I did, so I didn't feel like I was early in cryptocurrency,

1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:48.320
 in fact, because I was like, it was like 2014, it felt like a long time off the Bitcoin.

1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:54.080
 And then, but then I really liked some of the things that Ethereum was doing,

1:15:54.080 --> 1:15:56.800
 it seemed like a super visionary thing.

1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:00.560
 Like I was reading something that was just going to change the world

1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:01.760
 when I was reading the white paper.

1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:07.840
 And I liked the different constructs you could have inside of Ethereum

1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:09.600
 that you couldn't have on Bitcoin.

1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:11.760
 Like smart contracts and all that kind of stuff.

1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:16.400
 Exactly, yeah, and even spoke about different,

1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:18.720
 different, yeah, different constructions you could have.

1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:21.840
 Yeah, that's the cool dance between Bitcoin and Ethereum of,

1:16:21.840 --> 1:16:23.520
 it's in the space of ideas.

1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:24.480
 It feels so young.

1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:29.760
 Like I wonder what cryptocurrencies will look like in the future.

1:16:29.760 --> 1:16:34.320
 Like if Bitcoin or Ethereum 2.0 or some version will stick around

1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:37.040
 or any of those, like who's going to win out,

1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:39.840
 or if there's even a concept of winning out at all.

1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:43.200
 Is there a cryptocurrency that you're especially

1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:48.800
 really find interesting that technically financially,

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:53.120
 philosophically you think is something you're keeping your eye on?

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:57.920
 Well, I don't really, I'm not looking to like invest in cryptocurrencies anymore.

1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:04.960
 But I, they are, I mean, they're, and many are almost identical.

1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:08.240
 I mean, there's not, there wasn't too much difference

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:12.000
 between even Ethereum and Bitcoin in some ways, right?

1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:14.560
 But there are some that I like the privacy ones.

1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:17.680
 I mean, I was like, I like Zcash for its like coolness.

1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:22.160
 It's actually, it's like a different kind of invention

1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:24.160
 compared to some of the other things.

1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:27.040
 Can you speak to just briefly to privacy?

1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:30.960
 What is there some mechanism of preserving some privacy of the,

1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:33.120
 so I guess everything is public.

1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:37.120
 Yeah, the, yeah, none of the transactions are private.

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:42.080
 And so, you know, even like, I have some of my,

1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:45.040
 I have some numeraire and you can just see it.

1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:47.040
 In fact, you can go to a website and says like,

1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:49.520
 you can go to like ETHIScan and it'll say like,

1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:53.920
 numeraifounder and I'm like, how the hell do you guys know this?

1:17:53.920 --> 1:17:57.440
 So they can reverse engine and then, you know, whatever that's called.

1:17:57.440 --> 1:17:59.280
 Yeah. And so they can see me move it too.

1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:01.200
 They can see me. Oh, why is he moving it?

1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:01.840
 Yeah.

1:18:03.120 --> 1:18:06.240
 So, you know, you can see the, you know,

1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:10.720
 so, but yeah, Zcash, they're also,

1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:12.480
 when you can make private transactions,

1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:14.400
 you can also play different games.

1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:14.720
 Yes.

1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:17.760
 And it's unclear.

1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:19.440
 It's like, what's quite cool about Zcash is,

1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:20.800
 I wonder what games are being played there.

1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:22.160
 No one will know.

1:18:22.960 --> 1:18:26.080
 So from a deeply analytical perspective,

1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:30.000
 can you describe why Dogecoin is going to win?

1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:32.240
 Which it surely will.

1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:34.800
 Like it very likely will take over the world.

1:18:34.800 --> 1:18:37.200
 And once we expand out into the universe,

1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:38.400
 it will take over the universe.

1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:42.160
 Or in a more serious note, like,

1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:45.040
 what are your thoughts on the recent success of Dogecoin?

1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:49.040
 Where you've spoken to sort of the meme stocks,

1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:50.640
 the memetics of the whole thing,

1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:57.520
 that it feels like the joke can become the reality.

1:18:58.080 --> 1:19:02.320
 Like the meme, the joke has power in this world.

1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:03.280
 Yeah. It's fascinating.

1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:04.560
 Exactly.

1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:12.080
 It's like, why is it correlated with Elon tweeting about it?

1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:14.880
 It's not just Elon alone tweeting, right?

1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:18.640
 It's like Elon tweeting and that becomes a catalyst

1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.160
 for everybody on the internet,

1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:22.720
 kind of like spreading the joke, right?

1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:23.360
 Exactly.

1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:24.080
 The joke of it.

1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:27.440
 So it's the initial spark of the fire

1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:30.000
 for Wall Street Bets type of situation.

1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:30.880
 Yeah.

1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:36.320
 And that's fascinating because jokes seem to spread faster

1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:37.760
 than other mechanisms.

1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:38.080
 Yeah.

1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:45.200
 Funny shit is very effective at captivating the discourse

1:19:45.200 --> 1:19:45.920
 on the internet.

1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:48.480
 Yeah. And I think you can have,

1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:50.720
 like though I like the one meme,

1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:53.520
 like Doge, I haven't heard that name in a long time.

1:19:57.680 --> 1:20:00.080
 Like, I think back to that meme often.

1:20:00.080 --> 1:20:01.680
 That's like funny.

1:20:01.680 --> 1:20:03.440
 And every time I think back to it,

1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:06.960
 there's a little probability that I might buy.

1:20:06.960 --> 1:20:07.920
 Buy some Doge kind.

1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:08.640
 Right.

1:20:08.640 --> 1:20:11.120
 And so I imagine you should have millions of people

1:20:11.120 --> 1:20:13.440
 who have had all these great jokes told them.

1:20:14.400 --> 1:20:16.160
 And every now and then they reminisce,

1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:17.760
 oh, that was really funny.

1:20:17.760 --> 1:20:20.000
 And then they're like, let me buy some.

1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:24.000
 Wouldn't that be interesting if like the entire,

1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:26.560
 if we travel in time, like multiple centuries,

1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:29.520
 where the entirety of the communication

1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:32.160
 of the human species is like humor.

1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:35.360
 Like it's all just jokes.

1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:38.400
 Like we're high on probably some really advanced drugs.

1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:42.400
 And we're all just laughing nonstop.

1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:46.560
 It's a weird like dystopian future of just humor.

1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:53.120
 Elon has made me realize how like good it feels

1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:55.360
 to just not take shit seriously every once in a while

1:20:55.360 --> 1:20:57.920
 and just relieve like the pressure of the world.

1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:03.200
 At the same time, the reason I don't always like

1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:05.280
 when people finish their sentences with lol

1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:10.800
 is like that you don't, when you don't take anything seriously,

1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:13.040
 when everything becomes a joke,

1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:19.520
 then it feels like that way of thinking

1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:22.320
 feels like it will destroy the world.

1:21:22.320 --> 1:21:24.000
 It's like, I often think it like,

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:25.920
 well, me and save the world to destroy

1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:28.640
 because I think both are possible directions.

1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:30.320
 Yeah. I think this is a big problem.

1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:32.640
 I mean, America, I always felt that about America.

1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:35.680
 A lot of people are telling jokes kind of all the time

1:21:36.320 --> 1:21:37.600
 and they're kind of good at it.

1:21:38.800 --> 1:21:41.920
 And you take someone aside and American,

1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:44.080
 you're like, I really want to have a sincere conversation.

1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:46.080
 It's like hard to even keep a straight face

1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:49.600
 because everything is so, there's so much levity.

1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:51.200
 So it's complicated.

1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:54.800
 I like how sincere actually like your Twitter can be.

1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:57.120
 You're like, I am in love with the world today.

1:21:57.120 --> 1:21:59.280
 Yeah. I get so much shit for it.

1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:02.960
 I'm never going to stop because I realize like,

1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:05.120
 you have to be able to sometimes just be real

1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:09.120
 and be positive and just be save the cliche things,

1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:11.840
 which ultimately those things actually capture

1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:14.160
 some fundamental truths about life.

1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:14.880
 Yeah.

1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:16.480
 But it's a dance.

1:22:16.480 --> 1:22:19.280
 And I think Elon does a good job of that

1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:22.880
 from an engineering perspective of being able to joke,

1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:26.800
 but everyone's mostly to pull back and be like,

1:22:26.800 --> 1:22:27.920
 here's real problems.

1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:29.600
 Let's solve them and so on.

1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:31.680
 And then be able to jump back to a joke.

1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:33.920
 So it's ultimately, I think,

1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:36.800
 I guess a skill that we have to learn.

1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:41.680
 But I guess your advice is to invest everything

1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:44.560
 anyone listening owns into Dogecoin.

1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:45.600
 That's what I heard from this interaction.

1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:46.640
 Yeah, no, exactly.

1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:49.360
 Yeah, our hedge fund is unavailable.

1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:51.520
 Just go straight to Dogecoin.

1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:54.320
 You're running a successful company.

1:22:55.200 --> 1:22:58.480
 It's just interesting because my mind has been in that space

1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:02.560
 of potentially being one of the millions other entrepreneurs.

1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:08.240
 What's your advice on how to build a successful startup,

1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:09.760
 how to build a successful company?

1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:13.600
 I think that one thing I do like,

1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:16.800
 and it might be a particular thing about America,

1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:19.760
 but there is something about playing,

1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:23.280
 tell people what you really want to happen in the world.

1:23:23.280 --> 1:23:24.880
 Like, don't stop.

1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:27.440
 It's not going to make it,

1:23:28.560 --> 1:23:30.960
 like if you're asking someone to invest in your company,

1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:34.320
 don't say, I think maybe one day we might make a million dollars.

1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:38.400
 When you actually believe something else,

1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:41.360
 you actually believe you're actually more optimistic,

1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:43.920
 but you're toning down your optimism

1:23:43.920 --> 1:23:49.280
 because you want to appear low risk.

1:23:49.920 --> 1:23:54.320
 But actually it's super high risk if your company becomes mediocre

1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:57.360
 because no one wants to work in a mediocre company,

1:23:57.360 --> 1:23:58.800
 no one wants to invest in mediocre people.

1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:01.520
 So you should play the real game.

1:24:02.480 --> 1:24:04.320
 And obviously this doesn't apply to all businesses,

1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:06.960
 but if you play a venture backed startup kind of game,

1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:12.560
 like play for keeps, play to win, go big, and it's very hard to do that.

1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:19.760
 I've always feel like, yeah, you can start narrowing your focus

1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:22.080
 because 10 people are telling you,

1:24:22.080 --> 1:24:25.520
 you got to care about this boring thing

1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:26.880
 that won't matter five years from now.

1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:31.520
 And you should push back and do the real, play the real game.

1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:32.560
 It should be bold.

1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:36.560
 There's an interesting duality there.

1:24:36.560 --> 1:24:41.120
 So there's the way you speak to other people about your plans

1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:46.160
 and what you are privately, just in your own mind.

1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:50.160
 And maybe it's connected with what you're saying about sincerity as well.

1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:55.280
 If you appear to be sincerely optimistic about something

1:24:55.280 --> 1:24:57.600
 that's big or crazy,

1:24:57.600 --> 1:25:01.120
 it's putting yourself up to be kind of ridiculed or something.

1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:05.840
 And so if you say, my mission is to go to Mars,

1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:10.080
 it's just so bonkers that it's hard to say.

1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:14.240
 It is, but one powerful thing, just like you said,

1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:17.920
 is if you say it and you believe it,

1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:23.360
 then actually amazing people come and work with you.

1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:24.160
 Exactly.

1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:26.560
 It's not just skill, but the dreams.

1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:28.240
 There's something about optimism

1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:31.280
 that like that fire that you have when you're optimistic

1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:34.560
 of actually having the hope of building something totally cool,

1:25:34.560 --> 1:25:35.920
 something totally new,

1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:38.320
 that when those people get in a room together,

1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:40.000
 like they can actually do it.

1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:40.720
 Yeah.

1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:44.320
 Yeah, there's, yeah, there's, that's,

1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:48.000
 and also makes life really fun when you're in that room.

1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:52.560
 So all of that together, ultimately, I don't know,

1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:55.040
 that's what makes this crazy ride of a startup

1:25:55.040 --> 1:25:57.120
 really, really exciting.

1:25:57.120 --> 1:25:59.520
 A startup really look fun.

1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:02.320
 And Elon is an example of a person who succeeded at that.

1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:05.040
 There's not many other inspiring figures, which is sad.

1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:07.680
 I used to be a Google and there's,

1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:11.600
 there's something that happens that sometimes

1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:14.400
 when the company grows bigger and bigger and bigger,

1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:18.240
 where that kind of ambition kind of quits down a little bit.

1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:18.800
 Yeah.

1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:21.760
 You know, Google had this ambition still does

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:24.240
 of making the world's information accessible to everyone.

1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:27.040
 And I remember, I don't know, that's beautiful.

1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:31.120
 I still love that dream of,

1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:32.480
 that, you know, they used to scan books,

1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:34.080
 but just in every way possible,

1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:36.720
 make the world's information accessible.

1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:37.920
 Same with Wikipedia.

1:26:37.920 --> 1:26:39.520
 Every time I open up Wikipedia,

1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:46.080
 I'm just awe inspired by how awesome humans are, man.

1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:47.920
 And creating this together,

1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:49.600
 I don't know what the meetings are over there,

1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:52.000
 but they, it's just beautiful.

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.480
 Like what they've created is incredible.

1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:57.280
 And I'd love to be able to be part of something like that.

1:26:58.080 --> 1:26:59.200
 And you're right.

1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:00.400
 For that, you have to be bold.

1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:02.720
 And there's, and strange to me also,

1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:03.920
 I think you're right that there's

1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:05.600
 how many boring companies there are.

1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:06.080
 Right.

1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:08.000
 Something I always talk about, especially in fintech.

1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.640
 It's like, why am I excited about this?

1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:12.000
 This is so lame.

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:15.600
 Like what is, this isn't even like important.

1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:18.160
 Even if you succeed, this is going to be like, terrible.

1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:18.720
 Yeah.

1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:19.360
 This is not good.

1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:22.160
 This is not good. And it's just strange

1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:24.800
 how people can kind of get fake enthusiastic

1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:26.960
 about like boring ideas.

1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:27.760
 Yeah.

1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:32.720
 When there's so many bigger ideas that, yeah.

1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:33.840
 I mean, you read these things like,

1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:35.360
 this company raises money and it's just like,

1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:37.840
 that's a lot of money for the worst idea I've ever heard.

1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:41.360
 Some ideas are really big.

1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:43.760
 So like I worked on autonomous vehicles quite a bit.

1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:47.360
 And there's so many ways in which

1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:49.120
 you can present that idea to yourself

1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:51.360
 to the team you work with to just, yeah.

1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:53.360
 Like to yourself when you're quietly looking

1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:54.320
 in the mirror in the morning,

1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:57.600
 that's really boring or really exciting.

1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:00.800
 Like if you're really ambitious with autonomous vehicles,

1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:06.240
 there, it changes the nature of like human robot interaction.

1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:08.080
 It's changing the nature of how we move.

1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:08.720
 Forget money.

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:09.680
 Forget all that stuff.

1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:12.560
 It changes like everything about robotics and AI,

1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:14.080
 machine learning.

1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:16.400
 It changes everything about manufacturing.

1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:20.000
 I mean, the transportation is so fundamentally connected

1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:21.680
 to cars and if that changes,

1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:26.080
 it changes the fabric of society, of movies, of everything.

1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:29.520
 And if you go bold and take risks

1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:33.120
 and be willing to go bankrupt with your company

1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:37.440
 as opposed to cautiously, you can really change the world.

1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:40.480
 And it's so sad for me to see all these autonomous companies,

1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:41.520
 autonomous vehicle companies,

1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:45.120
 they're like really more focused about fundraising

1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:46.400
 and kind of like smoke and mirrors.

1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:47.280
 They're really afraid.

1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:51.040
 The entirety of their marketing is grounded in fear

1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:54.880
 and presenting enough smoke to where they keep raising funds

1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:59.040
 so they can cautiously use technology of a previous decade

1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:03.120
 or previous two decades to kind of test vehicles here and there

1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:05.600
 as opposed to do crazy things in bold

1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:09.440
 and go huge at scale, do huge data collection.

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:12.640
 So that's just an example.

1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:14.320
 Like the idea can be big,

1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:17.040
 but if you don't allow yourself to take that idea

1:29:17.040 --> 1:29:19.200
 and think really big with it,

1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:21.680
 then you're not going to make anything happen.

1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:24.000
 Yeah, you're absolutely right in that.

1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:31.200
 So you've been connected in your work with a bunch of amazing people.

1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:33.920
 How much interaction do you have with investors?

1:29:33.920 --> 1:29:36.720
 Like that whole process is an entire mystery to me.

1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:38.480
 Is there some people that just have influence

1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:42.800
 on the trajectory of your thinking completely?

1:29:42.800 --> 1:29:46.400
 Or is it just this collective energy that they behind the company?

1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:52.080
 Yeah, I mean, I came here and I was amazed how,

1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:54.720
 yeah, people would, I was only here for a few months

1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:56.480
 and I met some incredible investors

1:29:57.520 --> 1:29:59.680
 and I'd almost run out of money.

1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:04.800
 And once they invested, I was like,

1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:06.640
 I am not going to let you down.

1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:09.520
 And I was like, okay, I'm going to send them like an email update

1:30:09.520 --> 1:30:10.880
 every like three minutes.

1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:12.880
 And then they don't care at all.

1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:14.880
 So they kind of want to, I don't know.

1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:18.640
 So I like it when it's just like, they're always available to talk.

1:30:19.200 --> 1:30:24.320
 But a lot of building a business, especially a high tech business,

1:30:25.600 --> 1:30:27.840
 there's little for them to add, right?

1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:30.240
 There's little for them to add on product.

1:30:30.240 --> 1:30:32.880
 There's a lot for them to add on like business development.

1:30:33.600 --> 1:30:35.680
 And if we are doing product research,

1:30:35.680 --> 1:30:38.240
 which is for us research into the market,

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:40.240
 research into how to make a great hedge fund,

1:30:40.240 --> 1:30:45.600
 and we do that for years, there's not much to tell the investors.

1:30:45.600 --> 1:30:47.520
 So they're basically like, I believe in you.

1:30:47.520 --> 1:30:50.400
 There's something, I like to cut your jib.

1:30:50.400 --> 1:30:52.960
 There's something in your idea,

1:30:52.960 --> 1:30:55.840
 in your ambition, in your plans that I like.

1:30:56.640 --> 1:30:58.480
 And it's almost like a pat on the back.

1:30:58.480 --> 1:31:00.320
 I was like, go get them, kid.

1:31:00.320 --> 1:31:01.680
 Yeah, it is a bit like that.

1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:02.880
 And that's cool.

1:31:02.880 --> 1:31:03.920
 That's a good way to do it.

1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:05.120
 I'm glad they do it that way.

1:31:05.120 --> 1:31:07.440
 Like the one and meeting I had,

1:31:07.440 --> 1:31:09.280
 which was like really good with this one,

1:31:09.280 --> 1:31:12.160
 was like really good with this was meeting Howard Morgan,

1:31:13.200 --> 1:31:16.720
 who's actually a co founder of Renaissance Technologies

1:31:16.720 --> 1:31:20.400
 in the like 1980s and worked with Jim Simons.

1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:26.960
 And he was in the room and I was meeting some other guy

1:31:26.960 --> 1:31:28.160
 and he was in the room.

1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:32.880
 And I was explaining how quantitative finance works.

1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:36.560
 I was like, so, you know, they use mathematical models.

1:31:36.560 --> 1:31:40.400
 And then he was like, yeah, I started Renaissance.

1:31:40.400 --> 1:31:41.680
 I know a bit about this.

1:31:43.120 --> 1:31:44.720
 And then I was like, oh my God.

1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:49.520
 So yeah, but then I think he kind of said, well,

1:31:50.240 --> 1:31:52.080
 yeah, he said, well, because I was talking,

1:31:52.080 --> 1:31:55.120
 he was working at first round capital as a partner.

1:31:55.840 --> 1:31:57.760
 And they kind of said, they didn't want to invest.

1:31:59.040 --> 1:32:01.760
 And then I wrote a blog post describing the idea

1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:03.440
 and I was like, I really think you guys should invest.

1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:04.400
 And then they end up.

1:32:04.400 --> 1:32:05.600
 Oh, interesting.

1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:07.040
 You convinced them, oh, that must be good.

1:32:07.040 --> 1:32:08.080
 Yeah, because they're like, we don't really invest

1:32:08.080 --> 1:32:08.720
 in hedge funds.

1:32:08.720 --> 1:32:11.040
 And I was like, you don't see like what I'm doing.

1:32:11.040 --> 1:32:11.360
 This is something different.

1:32:11.360 --> 1:32:13.600
 This is so a tech company, not a hedge fund, right?

1:32:14.240 --> 1:32:15.680
 Yeah, and Numerize Brilliant.

1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:19.120
 It's when it caught my eye, there's something special there.

1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:21.760
 So I really do hope you succeed.

1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:24.720
 And obviously it's a risky thing you're taking on,

1:32:24.720 --> 1:32:26.480
 the ambition of it, the size of it.

1:32:26.480 --> 1:32:28.160
 But I do hope you succeed.

1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:29.360
 You mentioned Jim Simons.

1:32:30.240 --> 1:32:33.760
 He comes up in another world of mine really often on the,

1:32:33.760 --> 1:32:36.960
 he's just a brilliant guy on the mathematics side

1:32:36.960 --> 1:32:41.120
 as a mathematician, but he's also a brilliant finance,

1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:42.480
 hedge fund manager guy.

1:32:43.280 --> 1:32:45.440
 Have you gotten a chance to interact with him at all?

1:32:46.240 --> 1:32:49.760
 Have you learned anything from him on the math,

1:32:49.760 --> 1:32:53.760
 on the finance, on the philosophy, life side of things?

1:32:53.760 --> 1:32:55.440
 I've played poker with him.

1:32:55.440 --> 1:32:56.320
 It was pretty cool.

1:32:56.320 --> 1:32:58.960
 It was like, actually in the show Billions,

1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:02.320
 they kind of do a little thing about this poker tournament thing

1:33:02.320 --> 1:33:03.920
 with all the hedge fund managers.

1:33:03.920 --> 1:33:05.120
 And that's a real life thing.

1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:09.440
 And they have a lot of like world series of bracelet,

1:33:09.440 --> 1:33:11.520
 world series poker bracelets holders,

1:33:11.520 --> 1:33:13.040
 but it's kind of Jim's thing.

1:33:14.400 --> 1:33:16.720
 And I met him there.

1:33:16.720 --> 1:33:19.920
 And yeah, it was kind of brief, but I was just like,

1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:21.840
 he's like, oh, how do you, why are you here?

1:33:21.840 --> 1:33:23.520
 And I was like, oh, Howard sent me, you know,

1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:25.600
 he's like, go play this tournament,

1:33:25.600 --> 1:33:28.640
 meet some of the other players, and then.

1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:29.840
 Was it Texas Holdem?

1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:31.360
 Yeah, Texas Holdem tournament.

1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:33.680
 Do you play poker yourself, or was it?

1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:34.720
 Yeah, I do.

1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:35.760
 I mean, it was crazy.

1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:38.960
 And on my right was the CEO,

1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:41.840
 who's the current CEO of Renaissance, Peter Brown.

1:33:43.360 --> 1:33:46.880
 And Peter Muller, who's a hedge fund manager at PDT.

1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:51.040
 And yeah, I mean, it was just like, and then, you know,

1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:53.120
 just everyone, and then all these bracelet world series,

1:33:53.120 --> 1:33:55.120
 like people I know from like TV.

1:33:55.120 --> 1:34:00.080
 And Robert Mercer, who's fucking crazy.

1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:05.360
 He's the guy who donated the most money to Trump.

1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:08.960
 And he's just like.

1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:10.160
 It's a lot of personality.

1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:11.280
 Character, yeah.

1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:12.320
 Geez, this is crazy.

1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:17.520
 So it's quite cool how, yeah, like the, it was really fun.

1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:19.440
 And then I managed to knock out Peter Muller.

1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:22.560
 I have a, I got a little trophy for knocking him out,

1:34:22.560 --> 1:34:24.320
 because he was a previous champion.

1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:25.680
 In fact, I think he's won the most.

1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:26.800
 I think he's won three times.

1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:28.320
 Super smart guy.

1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:35.440
 But I will say Jim outlasted me in the tournament.

1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:40.320
 And they're all extremely good at poker.

1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:44.320
 But they're also, so it was a $10,000 buy in.

1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:48.560
 And I was like, this is kind of expensive.

1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:53.280
 But it all goes to charity, Jim's math charity.

1:34:54.320 --> 1:34:57.440
 But then the way they play, they have like rebies.

1:34:58.320 --> 1:35:00.960
 And like, they all do a shit ton of rebies.

1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:02.000
 This is for charity.

1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:02.720
 Yeah.

1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:07.520
 So immediately they're like going all in and I'm like, man, like,

1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:10.880
 so I end up, you know, adding more as well.

1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:13.040
 So the state.

1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:14.800
 Like you couldn't play at all without doing math.

1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:16.480
 Yeah, the stakes are high.

1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:18.640
 But you're connected to a lot of these folks.

1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:27.040
 They're kind of titans of just economics and tech in general.

1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:29.440
 Do you feel a burden from this, your young guy?

1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:32.320
 I did feel a bit out of place there.

1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:35.600
 Like the company was quite new.

1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:39.840
 And they also don't speak about things, right?

1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:44.160
 So it's not like going to meet a famous rocket engineer

1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:45.520
 who will tell you how to make a rocket.

1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:47.920
 They do not want to tell you anything

1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:49.440
 about how to make a hedge fund.

1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:51.360
 It's like all secretive.

1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:52.640
 And that part I didn't like.

1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:57.600
 And they were also kind of making fun of me a little bit.

1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:00.400
 Like they would say, like they'd call me like,

1:36:00.400 --> 1:36:03.440
 I don't know, the Bitcoin kid or, and then they would say,

1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:08.720
 even things like, remember Peter said to me something like,

1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:12.000
 I don't think AI is going to have a big role in finance.

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:15.120
 And I was like, hearing this from the CEO of Renaissance

1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:17.920
 was like weird to hear because I was like, of course it will.

1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:20.480
 And he's like, but he can see it.

1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:22.320
 I can see it having a really big impact

1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:24.160
 on things like self driving cars.

1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:27.120
 But finance, it's too noisy and whatever.

1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:29.600
 And so I don't think it's like the perfect application.

1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:31.600
 And I was like, that was interesting to hear.

1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:35.280
 Because it's like, and I think it was that same day that

1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:39.680
 Libra, I think it is, the poker playing AI

1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:42.000
 started to beat like the human.

1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:43.760
 So it's kind of funny hearing them like say,

1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:46.560
 oh, I'm not sure AI could ever get attack of that problem.

1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:48.640
 And then that very day is attacking the problem

1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:50.160
 of the game we're playing.

1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:54.880
 Well, there's a kind of a magic to somebody

1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:59.120
 who's exceptionally successful looking at you,

1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:01.920
 giving you respect, but also saying that

1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:05.520
 what you're doing is not going to succeed in a sense.

1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:07.360
 Like they're not really saying it.

1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:10.480
 But I tend to believe for my interactions with people

1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:14.080
 that it's a kind of prod to say, like prove me wrong.

1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:15.120
 Yeah.

1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:17.280
 That's ultimately, that's how those guys talk.

1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:19.680
 They see good talent and they're like, I'm...

1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:20.480
 Yeah.

1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:21.680
 And I think they're also saying

1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:25.040
 it's not going to succeed quickly in some way.

1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:27.440
 They're like, this is going to take a long time.

1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:31.280
 And maybe that's good to know.

1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:35.200
 And certainly AI in trading,

1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:40.880
 that's one of the most so philosophically interesting

1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:43.840
 questions about artificial intelligence

1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:45.040
 and the nature of money.

1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:48.000
 Because it's like, how much can you extract

1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:51.440
 in terms of patterns from all of these millions

1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:56.160
 of humans interacting using this methodology of money?

1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:57.600
 It's like one of the open questions

1:37:57.600 --> 1:37:58.880
 in the artificial intelligence.

1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:01.360
 In that sense, you converting it to a dataset

1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:05.040
 is one of the biggest gifts to people

1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:07.760
 in the research community, to the whole...

1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:10.960
 Anyone who loves data science and AI,

1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:13.760
 this is kind of fascinating.

1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:15.520
 I'd love to see where this goes, actually.

1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:16.720
 The thing I say sometimes,

1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:19.680
 long before AGI destroys the world,

1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:22.880
 a narrow intelligence will win all the money in the stock market.

1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:25.360
 Like, wait, just a narrow AI.

1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:26.320
 Yeah.

1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:29.840
 And I don't know if I'm going to be the one who invents that.

1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:33.440
 So I'm building Numeri to make sure that that narrow AI

1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:35.680
 uses our data.

1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:37.840
 So you're giving a platform to where millions of people

1:38:37.840 --> 1:38:43.200
 can participate and build that narrow AI themselves.

1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:45.520
 People love it when I ask this kind of question

1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:50.480
 about books, about ideas and philosophers and so on.

1:38:50.480 --> 1:38:56.720
 I was wondering if you had books or ideas,

1:38:56.720 --> 1:38:59.040
 philosophers, thinkers that had an influence

1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:01.360
 on your life when you were growing up

1:39:01.360 --> 1:39:05.200
 or just today that you would recommend that people check out

1:39:05.200 --> 1:39:09.520
 blog posts, podcasts, videos, all that kind of stuff.

1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:11.920
 Is there something that just kind of had an impact on you

1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:13.760
 that you currently recommend?

1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:18.800
 A super kind of obvious one that I really...

1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:22.000
 I was reading Zero to One while coming up with Numeri.

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.720
 It was like halfway through the book.

1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:26.960
 And I really do like a lot of the ideas there.

1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:29.200
 And it's also about kind of thinking big

1:39:29.200 --> 1:39:34.640
 and also it's like peculiar little book.

1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:36.960
 It's like there's a little picture of the hipster

1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:38.720
 versus Unabomber.

1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:40.320
 And it's a weird little book.

1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:42.640
 So there's kind of like some depth there.

1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:44.240
 Turns out a book on a...

1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:47.280
 If you're thinking of doing a startup, that's a good book.

1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:52.240
 A book I like a lot is maybe my favorite book

1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:56.080
 is David Deutsch's Beginning of Infinity.

1:39:56.080 --> 1:40:00.320
 I just found that so optimistic.

1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:02.000
 It puts you...

1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:03.680
 Everything you read in science,

1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:06.320
 it makes the world feel kind of colder.

1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:10.560
 Because it's like we're just coming from evolution

1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:12.880
 and coming from...

1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:15.120
 Nothing should be this way or whatever.

1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:16.640
 And humans are not very powerful.

1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:19.200
 We're just like scum on the earth.

1:40:19.200 --> 1:40:21.600
 And the way David Deutsch sees things and argues...

1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:23.760
 He argues them with the same rigor

1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:26.080
 that the cynics often use

1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:29.760
 and then has a much better conclusion.

1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:33.360
 That's some of the statements and things like...

1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:39.200
 Anything that doesn't violate the laws of physics can be solved.

1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:41.840
 So ultimately arriving in a hopeful...

1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:42.960
 Like a hopeful path forward.

1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:45.600
 Without being like a hippie.

1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:47.600
 You've mentioned kind of advice for startups.

1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:50.480
 Is there in general, whether you do a startup or not,

1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:52.640
 do you have advice for young people today?

1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:56.160
 You're like an example of somebody who's paved their own path

1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:59.120
 and were, I would say, exceptionally successful.

1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:00.160
 Is there advice?

1:41:00.160 --> 1:41:04.000
 Somebody who's like 20 today, 18 on a grad

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:07.920
 or thinking about going to college or in college and so on

1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:09.440
 that you would give them?

1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:11.840
 I think I often tell young people,

1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:16.880
 don't start a company unless you're prepared

1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:19.520
 to make it your life's work.

1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:22.560
 That's a really good way of putting it.

1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:23.600
 And a lot of people think,

1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:27.200
 well, this semester I'm going to take a semester off

1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:29.600
 and in that one semester I'm going to start a company

1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:31.120
 and sell it or whatever.

1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:33.280
 And it's just like, what are you talking about?

1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:34.880
 It doesn't really work that way.

1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:37.200
 You should be like super into the idea,

1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:40.960
 so into it that you want to spend a really long time on it.

1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:44.000
 Is that more about psychology or actual time allocation?

1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:47.440
 Like is it literally the fact that you need to give 100%

1:41:47.440 --> 1:41:49.680
 for potentially years for it to succeed?

1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:51.600
 Or is it more about just the mindset

1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:53.520
 that's required?

1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:57.680
 Yeah, I mean, I think you certainly don't want to have a plan

1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:02.080
 to sell the company quickly or something.

1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:07.200
 Or it's like a company that has a big fashion component.

1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:08.560
 Like it'll only work now.

1:42:08.560 --> 1:42:10.240
 It's like an app or something.

1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:14.880
 So yeah, that's a big one.

1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:18.800
 And then I also think something I've thought about recently

1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:21.440
 is I had a job as a quant

1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:25.760
 at a fund for about two and a half years.

1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:30.880
 And part of me thinks if I had spent another two years there,

1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:36.560
 I would have learned a lot more and had even more knowledge

1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:41.040
 to be where, to basically accelerate how long numer I took.

1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:44.560
 So the idea that you can sit in an air conditioned room

1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:48.720
 and get free food or even sit at home now in your underwear

1:42:48.720 --> 1:42:52.480
 and make a huge amount of money and learn whatever you want

1:42:53.280 --> 1:42:54.960
 and get, it's just crazy.

1:42:54.960 --> 1:42:56.400
 It's such a good deal.

1:42:56.400 --> 1:42:56.880
 Yeah.

1:42:56.880 --> 1:42:57.760
 Oh, that's interesting.

1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:00.160
 That's the case for, I was terrified of that.

1:43:00.160 --> 1:43:03.120
 Like a Google, I thought I would become really comfortable

1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:05.120
 in that air conditioned room.

1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:09.200
 And that I was afraid of the quant situation is,

1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:13.120
 I mean, what you presented is really brilliant

1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:17.360
 that it's exceptionally valuable the lessons you learn

1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:20.960
 because you get to get paid while you learn from others.

1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:26.880
 If you see jobs in the space of your passion that way,

1:43:27.760 --> 1:43:29.200
 that it's just an education.

1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:31.280
 It's like the best kind of education.

1:43:31.280 --> 1:43:34.000
 But of course, from my perspective,

1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.200
 you have to be really careful not to get comfortable.

1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:39.600
 Again, in a relationship, then you buy a house

1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:40.720
 or whatever the hell it is.

1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:43.840
 And then you get, and then you convince yourself,

1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:46.480
 like, well, I have to pay these fees for the car,

1:43:46.480 --> 1:43:48.080
 for the house, blah, blah, blah.

1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:49.600
 And then there's momentum.

1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:51.200
 And all of a sudden you're in your death bed

1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:52.320
 and there's grandchildren.

1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:55.360
 And you're drinking whiskey and complaining

1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:56.240
 about kids these days.

1:43:56.800 --> 1:44:00.240
 So I'm afraid of that momentum, but you're right.

1:44:01.520 --> 1:44:03.920
 There's something special about the education

1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:06.160
 you get working at these companies.

1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:08.000
 Yeah, and I remember on my desk,

1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:11.120
 I had a bunch of papers on quant finance,

1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:13.200
 a bunch of papers on optimization.

1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:16.400
 And then a paper on Ethereum, just on my desk as well.

1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:17.440
 And the white paper.

1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:21.040
 And it's like, it's been amazing how much, how kind of,

1:44:22.560 --> 1:44:24.560
 and you can learn about, so that I also thought,

1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:28.240
 I think this idea of learning about intersections of things.

1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:29.680
 I don't think there are too many people

1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:32.720
 that know as much about crypto and quant finance

1:44:33.440 --> 1:44:35.520
 and machine learning as I do.

1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:39.040
 And that's a really nice set of three things

1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:40.400
 to know stuff about.

1:44:40.400 --> 1:44:42.880
 And that was because I had free time in my job.

1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:46.320
 Okay, let me ask the perfectly impractical,

1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:47.520
 but the most important question.

1:44:47.520 --> 1:44:50.560
 What's the meaning of all the things you're trying

1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:52.800
 to do so many amazing things?

1:44:52.800 --> 1:44:53.760
 Why?

1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:57.840
 What's the meaning of this life of yours or ours?

1:44:57.840 --> 1:44:59.360
 I don't know.

1:44:59.360 --> 1:45:00.320
 Humans.

1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:03.280
 Yeah, so I have yet had some people say,

1:45:03.280 --> 1:45:05.520
 asking what meaning of life is,

1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:07.600
 is like asking the wrong question or something.

1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:08.800
 The question is wrong.

1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:09.600
 Yeah.

1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:11.760
 No, usually people get too many questions.

1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:14.480
 Usually people get too nervous to be able to say that

1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:16.080
 because it's like your question sucks.

1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:18.720
 I don't think there's an answer.

1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:20.400
 It's like the searching for it.

1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:22.800
 It's like sometimes asking it.

1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:25.440
 It's like sometimes sitting back and looking up at the stars

1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:29.040
 and being like, huh, I wonder if there's aliens up there.

1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:36.320
 There's a useful pallet cleanser aspect to it

1:45:36.320 --> 1:45:39.520
 because it kind of wakes you up to all the little busy,

1:45:39.520 --> 1:45:42.560
 hurried day to day activities, all the meetings,

1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:44.480
 all the things you're like a part of.

1:45:45.040 --> 1:45:47.520
 We're just like ants, a part of a system,

1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:48.800
 a part of another system.

1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:52.000
 And then when this asking this bigger question

1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:53.760
 allows you to kind of zoom out and think about it.

1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:57.520
 But there's ultimately, I think it's an impossible thing

1:45:57.520 --> 1:46:01.360
 for a limited cognitive capacity to capture.

1:46:01.360 --> 1:46:03.760
 But it's fun to listen to somebody who's exceptionally

1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:09.680
 successful, exceptionally busy now, who's also young like you,

1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:13.680
 to ask these kinds of questions about like death.

1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:19.120
 Do you consider your own mortality kind of thing and life,

1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:21.680
 whether that enters your mind?

1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:24.960
 Because it kind of almost gets in the way.

1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:28.720
 Yeah. It's amazing how many things that are trivial

1:46:28.720 --> 1:46:33.680
 that occupy a lot of your mind until something bad happens.

1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:35.440
 Or something flips you.

1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:38.320
 And then you start thinking about the people you love

1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:39.600
 that are in your life.

1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:40.960
 Then you started thinking about like,

1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:42.800
 holy shit, this right ends.

1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:46.720
 Exactly. Yeah. I just had COVID.

1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:48.960
 And I had it quite bad.

1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:50.160
 It wasn't really bad.

1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:54.960
 It was just like, I also got a simultaneous lung infection.

1:46:55.520 --> 1:46:59.120
 So I had like almost like bronchitis or whatever.

1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:01.840
 I don't even, I don't understand that stuff.

1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:05.760
 But I started, and then you're forced to be isolated.

1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:08.720
 And so it's actually kind of nice.

1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:11.440
 Because it's very depressing.

1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:15.680
 And then I've heard stories of, I think it's Sean Parker,

1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:18.080
 he had like all these diseases as a child.

1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:20.560
 And he had to like just stay in bed for years.

1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:22.000
 And then he like made Napster.

1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:24.000
 It's like pretty cool.

1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:28.320
 So yeah, I had about 15 days of this recently, just last month.

1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:34.480
 And it feels like it did shock me into a new kind of energy and ambition.

1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:37.840
 Were there moments when you were just like terrified

1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:39.600
 at the combination of loneliness?

1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:42.960
 And like, you know, the thing about COVID is like,

1:47:42.960 --> 1:47:44.640
 there's some degree of uncertainty.

1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:48.320
 Like it feels like it's a new thing, a new monster

1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:50.800
 that's arrived on this earth.

1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:53.360
 And so, you know, dealing with a loan,

1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:55.600
 a lot of people are dying.

1:47:55.600 --> 1:47:58.240
 It's like wondering like... Yeah, you do wonder.

1:47:58.240 --> 1:47:59.120
 I mean, for sure.

1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:03.040
 And then there are even new strains in South Africa,

1:48:03.040 --> 1:48:03.840
 which is where I was.

1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:08.400
 And maybe the new strain had some interaction of my genes

1:48:08.400 --> 1:48:09.440
 and I'm just going to die.

1:48:09.440 --> 1:48:11.360
 But ultimately it was liberating somehow.

1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:11.840
 I loved it.

1:48:12.400 --> 1:48:14.560
 Oh, I loved that I got out of it.

1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:15.760
 Okay.

1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:17.040
 Because it also affects your mind.

1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:20.560
 You get confusion and kind of a lot of fatigue.

1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:24.640
 And you can't do your usual tricks of psyching yourself out of it.

1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:27.280
 So, you know, sometimes it's like, oh man, I feel tired.

1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:29.520
 Okay, I'm just going to go have coffee and then I'll be fine.

1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:31.280
 It's like, now it's like, I feel tired.

1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:33.280
 I don't even want to get out of bed to get coffee

1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:34.640
 because I feel so tired.

1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:36.080
 And then you have to confront.

1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:40.640
 There's no like quick fix cure and you're trapped at home.

1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:41.040
 But that...

1:48:41.840 --> 1:48:43.920
 So, now you have this little thing that happened to you

1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:45.600
 that was a reminder that you're mortal

1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:52.240
 and you get to carry that flag in trying to create something

1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:53.600
 special in this world, right?

1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:54.800
 With Numeri.

1:48:54.800 --> 1:48:58.160
 Listen, this was like one of my favorite conversations

1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:03.120
 because the way you think about this world of money

1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:05.120
 and just this world in general is so clear

1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:08.560
 and you're able to explain it so eloquently.

1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:09.760
 Richard, it was really fun.

1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:10.880
 Really appreciate you talking to it.

1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:11.440
 Thank you.

1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:11.840
 Thank you.
