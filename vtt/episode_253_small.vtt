 The following is a conversation with Michael Malis, his fifth time on this, the Lex Friedman

00:08.720 --> 00:14.160
 podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, here's

00:14.160 --> 00:21.760
 my New Year's Eve 2021 conversation with the one and only, Mr. Michael Malis.

00:21.760 --> 00:30.080
 Dostoevsky wrote in The Idiot, my favorite of his books,

00:30.800 --> 00:35.600
 through the main character, Prince Mishkin, that beauty will save the world.

00:38.560 --> 00:45.200
 These words seemingly naive and ultimately, at least to me, profound. What do they mean to you?

00:45.200 --> 00:46.400
 Beauty will save the world.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.520
 Naive? Really? I don't think they seem naive at all.

00:49.520 --> 00:56.560
 Well, Solzhenitsyn, actually, for his 1970 Nobel Prize speech, talked about this line a lot.

00:57.200 --> 01:02.080
 And he thought for most of his life, that was a silly line. There was just words thrown out there,

01:02.080 --> 01:07.040
 because with all the suffering that's in the world, what has beauty actually ever done?

01:07.040 --> 01:08.960
 Oh, my God, I hate this so much.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.680
 You're talking trash about Solzhenitsyn?

01:11.680 --> 01:17.440
 Yeah, I am. And this perfectly sets up this theme. I said, let's do this episode,

01:17.440 --> 01:20.880
 start the new year on a positive note, give people hope, give people joy.

01:22.560 --> 01:28.960
 You and I both have friends who are models, right? And it's a silly profession to some extent, of

01:28.960 --> 01:33.760
 course. But you are actually a model. You are my friend.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.520
 I am. That's right. That's true. I am under a model. I was trying to be subtle.

01:37.520 --> 01:45.440
 But for those people who actually deserve to be models, when you look at someone who is a model

01:45.440 --> 01:51.920
 and in some of their photos, and these people look perfect. Now, in real life, they're not perfect.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.640
 They have flaws. They'll be the first to admit it, so on and so forth. But when you look at beauty,

01:57.440 --> 02:05.200
 it is almost impossible to maintain a sense of cynicism and hopelessness. Because if there's

02:05.200 --> 02:12.240
 even one moment when some element of perfection has been actualized, if there's one moment where

02:12.240 --> 02:17.680
 a beauty has been realized and captured, you can't say, well, it's never going to happen again.

02:18.400 --> 02:27.280
 So I think beauty, it means hope. I think I hate that cynical idea of like,

02:28.880 --> 02:33.920
 I get, I appreciate Solzhenitsyn's broader point that a lot of times people, there's something

02:33.920 --> 02:38.480
 called the deepity, where people throw words together to sound profound. And if you take it

02:38.480 --> 02:43.520
 apart, like this is just complete gibberish, I don't think this is an example of that. I think

02:43.520 --> 02:51.040
 beauty inspires, and more importantly, it proves to you this is something that can actually happen

02:51.040 --> 02:57.200
 on this earth. Plato, right? The Platonic theory of forms, like this world is imperfect, but these

02:57.200 --> 03:01.040
 perfect forms exist in another dimension, and that's where our concepts come from. He was an

03:01.040 --> 03:06.000
 early person trying to figure out where our concepts come from, and epistemology and so on and so

03:06.000 --> 03:14.320
 forth. But that is something that is real in here. So I completely disagree with his analysis of that,

03:14.320 --> 03:18.480
 and I don't know if it'll save the world, but it's certainly a prerequisite. And what's the point

03:18.480 --> 03:23.280
 of fighting for your values, if you don't want to make the world a more beautiful place?

03:23.280 --> 03:27.040
 Well, it's also how you define beauty, because beauty could be just aesthetic beauty, could be

03:27.040 --> 03:34.400
 art. Of course, art could be, could encompass a lot, a lot more than just literature and paintings,

03:34.400 --> 03:41.840
 it can encompass the full life, the full dance of life. But then beauty could be something

03:42.480 --> 03:50.720
 just deeper, like whatever that awe you feel, when you pause and hear the music,

03:51.760 --> 03:58.160
 just hear and look up at the stars. For some reason, when I see rockets go up,

03:58.160 --> 04:02.720
 for me, it's like science. What is that? The awe that we're able to accomplish

04:02.720 --> 04:06.880
 that as humans. You know, that's funny, because there's lots of different schools of thought,

04:06.880 --> 04:13.120
 like these people versus these people, and maybe vegans versus steakhouse people.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.080
 I think in terms of the sciences, and I guess you and I would be on opposite sides here,

04:18.640 --> 04:26.080
 you have the astronomy people versus the zoology people. The big question is, would you rather

04:26.640 --> 04:32.320
 spend 10 minutes on the moon, or would you rather spend 10 minutes in the deep sea? And for me,

04:32.320 --> 04:37.440
 it's clearly the deep sea. The zoology that's down there, there's something I would encourage

04:37.440 --> 04:43.440
 people to look up called deep staria, which is a jellyfish. The scientists, what's amazing when

04:43.440 --> 04:49.680
 you watch these deep sea dives on YouTube is that the scientists, their nature dorks like

04:49.680 --> 04:55.120
 everybody else, they went into this field, and there's none of this, maybe, soul genitian style

04:55.120 --> 05:02.160
 cynicism of when they see an amazing animal in its natural environment, you know, exhibiting these

05:02.160 --> 05:07.920
 crazy behaviors, they lose it. They're on the mic like, oh my god, and like, it's so exciting to

05:07.920 --> 05:14.720
 watch. So I'm not a rocket person, but I'm definitely a zoology person. So animals and plants in the

05:14.720 --> 05:19.040
 sea. And also, it's so mathematical. There's so much, so many forms. There's this, there's this,

05:20.880 --> 05:26.240
 there's this plant called areospermum titanupsoides. I don't know how to pronounce it, because they're

05:26.240 --> 05:29.840
 always in Latin, you never hear them pronounced. You said sperm. Areospermum, yeah, because it's

05:29.840 --> 05:36.560
 woolly seed is the, is the genus. The leaf, it's just always puts out one leaf, but the leaf is

05:36.560 --> 05:43.120
 covered in little magnifying glasses, lenses to make it maximize the sunlight. So it looks like

05:43.120 --> 05:48.960
 this little crystal seashell, it's tiny, it's like two centimeters, but it's just this amazing thing

05:48.960 --> 05:54.880
 that has, that grows out of the sands in South Africa. Just a defense old Jensen for a second.

05:54.880 --> 06:01.200
 So if I may read a couple of his lines from the speech, so he said, one day, this is how he introduces

06:01.200 --> 06:07.120
 it, one day, Dostoevsky throughout the enigmatic remark, beauty will save the world. What sort

06:07.120 --> 06:12.720
 of a statement is that? For a long time, I considered it near words. How could that be possible

06:12.720 --> 06:20.640
 when in bloodthirsty history, did beauty ever save anyone from anything? And then later, he

06:20.640 --> 06:26.960
 goes on to argue with himself in the speech as a older wiser man now. But perhaps that ancient

06:26.960 --> 06:33.280
 trinity of truth, goodness, and beauty is not simply an empty fated formula, as we thought in

06:33.280 --> 06:39.920
 the days of our self confident materialistic youth. If the tops of these three trees converge,

06:39.920 --> 06:45.600
 as the scholars maintained, but the two blatant to direct stems of truth and goodness are crushed,

06:45.600 --> 06:52.240
 cut down, not allowed through, then perhaps the fantastic, unpredictable, unexpected stems of

06:52.240 --> 06:58.800
 beauty will push through and soar to that very same place. And so doing will fulfill the work

06:58.800 --> 07:05.120
 of all three. In that case, Dostoevsky's remark, beauty will save the world, was not a careless

07:05.120 --> 07:12.800
 phrase, but a prophecy. Which of your, which of these three things are your favorites? Truth,

07:12.800 --> 07:19.760
 goodness, or beauty? What did he call truth and goodness? The blatant to direct stems of truth

07:19.760 --> 07:28.480
 and goodness versus the fantastic, unpredictable, unexpected stems of beauty, which is how I see

07:28.480 --> 07:32.720
 your Twitter account. I don't think that I think there's certain birth of beauty to be had in my

07:32.720 --> 07:39.600
 Twitter account, that's for sure. It's certainly no goodness. Or truth. Yeah, yeah. It's Twitter,

07:39.600 --> 07:45.760
 there's no truth to be found. I would, I will answer the question. I will, of course, point out

07:45.760 --> 07:50.640
 that having this kind of, you know, distinction between the three things is, I think, kind of

07:50.640 --> 07:55.040
 synthetic. I think they very heavily overlap. If not, if I could probably make the argument,

07:55.040 --> 07:59.520
 they're synonymous. In fact, I do believe that they're largely synonymous.

07:59.520 --> 08:07.520
 Goodness. That's such an interesting word, goodness. Which of those three is my favorite?

08:09.680 --> 08:17.600
 I think truth is overrated in the sense that if something is a good story,

08:18.480 --> 08:24.080
 the story doesn't have to be true or real in order to motivate you and move you.

08:24.080 --> 08:33.440
 A lot of times we can delude ourselves about somebody and that might actually serve a purpose to

08:33.440 --> 08:38.480
 some extent. You know, if you have someone who's maybe a family member and you kind of ignore

08:38.480 --> 08:45.040
 bad things that they do, there might be a reason for that. Of the three, which is most important,

08:45.600 --> 08:52.080
 I think, I would say probably goodness. I would say of the three, the most important is goodness,

08:52.080 --> 09:01.360
 because if you don't appreciate goodness, then beauty is just empty. It's just a picture or

09:01.360 --> 09:10.080
 it's nice. Bad people appreciate beauty. Bad people are often seductive or have a beauty about them.

09:10.080 --> 09:16.720
 In terms of action, I think it takes a lot of skill and work to create beauty or to create

09:16.720 --> 09:25.840
 truth or to express truth or to express beauty. But I think goodness is the easiest default

09:25.840 --> 09:33.840
 state of being, just being good to others. Yeah. There'll be things where these videos where

09:33.840 --> 09:40.000
 one dog is drowning and another dog jumps in and saves it from the pool. That to me is

09:40.000 --> 09:50.560
 just really amazing stuff and is very moving. To me, goodness means integrity and it means kindness.

09:53.280 --> 10:00.560
 And yeah, I think of the three, that would be the one I pick. I think people also have this

10:00.560 --> 10:06.000
 idea, which is inculcated to them, especially by corporate America, that as you get older,

10:06.000 --> 10:11.680
 it's okay to do the wrong things sometimes, blah, blah, blah. I don't buy that. And so,

10:11.680 --> 10:17.600
 I think goodness gets rarer and rarer. And I think people know better and they tell themselves lies.

10:18.240 --> 10:26.960
 Yeah. But once you get, allow yourself the chance to just be good, I think it makes for a better

10:26.960 --> 10:32.000
 life. Yeah. It's not that much work. It's not like going to the gym or working out. That's a lot

10:32.000 --> 10:37.600
 of work and it's great afterwards. But goodness is easy once you get into the habit of it. I

10:37.600 --> 10:41.360
 suppose working out the same way. There's a lot of stuff. If you make it to a habit,

10:42.720 --> 10:47.360
 you're going to get the rewards of it and it's going to be easy. The rewards of goodness,

10:47.360 --> 10:53.120
 I think, are more immediate than the rewards of working out. As opposed to the hard drugs.

10:53.120 --> 10:58.560
 Yeah. If you mentioned this quote on one of your live streams, I think, if you save one life,

10:58.560 --> 11:05.440
 you save the world. Yeah. That's such a cool line. I remember reading about Paul Farmer,

11:05.440 --> 11:11.600
 I think his name is, he's a doctor that really, I mean, doctors in general, they kind of don't care

11:11.600 --> 11:19.680
 about like what they're doing as a broad policy across hundreds of thousands of millions of

11:19.680 --> 11:23.840
 people. They just care about the human in front of them. Which is so interesting. They don't care

11:23.840 --> 11:30.240
 it's going to cost, like in his case, to save one child, it will cost him hundreds of thousands of

11:30.240 --> 11:36.640
 dollars. They don't care about that. They can't, they know very well that what their actions cannot

11:36.640 --> 11:42.640
 be scaled, but they can't help but help the child in front of them. And it's so interesting.

11:44.400 --> 11:48.960
 There's such an interesting way to live. And that's the way I kind of think when I try to do

11:48.960 --> 11:58.400
 something positive is will this help one person? And I just kind of imagine a specific person

11:58.400 --> 12:02.560
 depending on the thing that that would help with, like what I'm trying to create something,

12:02.560 --> 12:08.080
 whether it's a piece of hardware or a video or anything like that, or educational material,

12:08.080 --> 12:13.040
 lecture, that kind of stuff. I don't know. What do you think about this quote? Like what,

12:13.040 --> 12:18.560
 is it profound or just just poetic? I think it's more profound than it sounds at first.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.800
 The example I think of is Michelle Bachman. She was a former congresswoman from Minnesota.

12:22.800 --> 12:27.600
 She clearly had crazy eyes. Something weird was going on with the husband. But she adopted like

12:28.320 --> 12:33.440
 20 kids. Terry Shappert's another friend of mine. He's like either Navy SEAL or Marines,

12:33.440 --> 12:39.520
 whatever it is. Terry, I apologize. I'm not trying to be funny. And he adopts like elder dogs. So

12:40.480 --> 12:44.720
 going back to Bachman, it's like, yeah, you can say she's crazy. You can make fun of her politics,

12:44.720 --> 12:50.560
 all you want, and all that stuff's legitimate. But if you save a kid, give them a home, and you

12:50.560 --> 12:54.720
 save them from the foster system, and you put a roof over their heads and make them feel loved

12:54.720 --> 13:01.680
 and appreciated, it's really hard for me to sit here and call you like a totally bad person.

13:02.240 --> 13:08.800
 I think that kind of thing is Nick Cersei's another one. He adopted a kid. And I said,

13:08.800 --> 13:15.440
 I think you're a hero. One of the things that's very hard for me, as you know,

13:15.440 --> 13:20.880
 I talk about this endlessly, this book, The White Pill. But writing about when people do

13:20.880 --> 13:26.400
 hurtful things to children, it really is hard to watch. And it's hard to, because when you're an

13:26.400 --> 13:29.200
 author, you have to kind of empathize with the character. You have to, where's this character

13:29.200 --> 13:33.520
 coming from? Explain their point of view. And that's the one that's the hardest for me to wrap

13:33.520 --> 13:42.160
 my head around. Cruelty to children. Yeah. And yeah, sadism to children. This is something

13:42.160 --> 13:46.000
 even animals know not to do, do you know what I mean? Dogs, when you see them around kids,

13:46.000 --> 13:50.320
 they're very protective. If the kid pokes their eyes out, the dog doesn't do anything.

13:51.600 --> 13:56.640
 If you can't even get to that level, what kind of person are you? So I think that quote

13:56.640 --> 14:04.880
 is a profound one. And it's an important one. It also means we're not all called upon to be

14:04.880 --> 14:11.920
 Superman, right? You only have very finite ability to move the needle. But at the same time,

14:12.480 --> 14:17.920
 if you have actually, you know, saved the life, you can go to meet your maker. You did your part.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.880
 You know, you left the world a little bit better than you found it. And that's all you could ask

14:20.880 --> 14:28.080
 anybody. Also, I think from a policy perspective, it seems we just do better when we focus on doing

14:28.080 --> 14:33.120
 a small thing, helping a helping one person, because it feels like when you start talking

14:33.120 --> 14:36.960
 about communism and all those kinds of things, when you start to believe you could do good by a

14:36.960 --> 14:42.800
 lot of people, that's where your mind somehow stops being able to do good by a lot of people.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.800
 That's when you start to think about utopias and somehow utopias goes to

14:46.800 --> 14:52.560
 the feeds, power into the brain to where it deludes you completely. And then you start,

14:53.120 --> 14:57.920
 it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelet kind of reasoning and you run into trouble.

14:57.920 --> 15:02.800
 It seems like it's much better even when you have the power and the money and so on

15:02.800 --> 15:09.200
 to achieve scale to focus on one and then or locally locally. Yeah. Yeah. Because then

15:09.200 --> 15:13.680
 also you have the feedback, right? So if you have some kind of program, you know, in Austin or

15:13.680 --> 15:17.360
 Brooklyn or something like that and you can, you can watch, oh, this is working, this isn't working,

15:17.360 --> 15:22.800
 then you can port it out to other places. But top down helping is, you know, at the very least,

15:22.800 --> 15:27.200
 it's going to be inefficient. And also, I think it's a lot more useful when you're helping people,

15:27.200 --> 15:31.920
 when it's a one on one relationship, because then it's less, I don't know, embarrassing,

15:31.920 --> 15:36.640
 but certainly less something to receive help. And you also feel if it's one thing, if you get a

15:36.640 --> 15:40.400
 check from the government, you know, food stamps, it's not thing if someone's like, hey, I'm going

15:40.400 --> 15:44.400
 to buy your groceries until you get back on your feet. You have this kind of motivation. I think

15:44.400 --> 15:49.920
 for most people to be like, you know what, this person believed in me, I'm going to make it worth

15:49.920 --> 15:54.880
 their while that they believed in me. Because I didn't believe in me. Yeah. When I was giving

15:54.880 --> 16:00.240
 lectures at MIT, there was one that was scare shitless. And I mean, everybody, you know,

16:00.240 --> 16:04.000
 how students are and all that kind of stuff, they're kind of bored. Yeah. And they don't,

16:04.000 --> 16:10.960
 they don't understand that you're human too. Yeah. Or this could be just me.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.440
 Oh, they don't understand you're trying to pass this human.

16:13.440 --> 16:19.440
 I know. But there's one, one gentleman in the audience, and he went to all the lectures,

16:20.000 --> 16:26.400
 all the gentlemen, he was a faculty at MIT. And he just, without very kind of nonchalant,

16:26.400 --> 16:30.480
 just said, after the lectures, he kind of nodded me and say, you did great.

16:30.480 --> 16:38.000
 And before, like one time he said, in a noncreepy way, I know this is going to come off as creepy.

16:38.000 --> 16:44.800
 He said, you look great today. Like he said that in a, I don't know, in the way, so he's

16:44.800 --> 16:51.920
 like 60, 70, whatever, like he, in this, I don't know, it's a wise sage way. Because I was wearing

16:51.920 --> 16:56.240
 a suit and tie. Like I look like, you know, when you dress up like a young kid, you dress

16:56.240 --> 17:02.880
 like a mother. So he was just like, all right, yeah, you're, you're all dressed up. You look

17:02.880 --> 17:07.120
 great. You got this. I don't know. That has an elastic impact that kind of

17:07.120 --> 17:15.200
 pad on the back. But I agree with you. Cruelty towards other adults is somehow understandable.

17:16.160 --> 17:22.880
 Because it's a world full of conflict, but cruelty towards children doesn't,

17:22.880 --> 17:31.280
 it doesn't quite, I can't, I can't understand it. I can't understand how you could act in a way

17:31.280 --> 17:38.160
 that directly causes suffering to a child in front of you. Yeah, that is like the, I don't think

17:38.160 --> 17:42.800
 I've ever talked to you. This might be a good time to ask you about this. What do you make,

17:42.800 --> 17:49.680
 what lessons do you draw about human civilization from Jeffrey Epstein, from just laying out.

17:49.680 --> 17:54.240
 Well, everybody thinks about different things. When you talk to Eric Weinstein, he thinks about

17:55.040 --> 18:01.200
 intelligence and like who, like Jeffrey Epstein is the front for something else. That's what he

18:01.200 --> 18:09.120
 thinks about. I think about the weakness of grown men in the face of charismatic evil,

18:09.120 --> 18:15.040
 which is like for me directly is MIT. I didn't know, I actually was, I guess I was at MIT when

18:15.040 --> 18:21.760
 Jeffrey Epstein was just at the very end. He must have been there. I didn't know any of this,

18:21.760 --> 18:28.160
 but it really bothers me that nobody was able to see through this man. Because he's obviously,

18:28.160 --> 18:35.680
 what is also obvious to me is that he was very charismatic. Like, I mean, I try to think about

18:36.880 --> 18:42.480
 human nature from this perspective is directly, like we said, help one life.

18:42.480 --> 18:49.920
 Would I know a Jeffrey Epstein if he was in my life? Would I know evil when I saw evil?

18:49.920 --> 18:58.080
 Even if it's sitting across from you. Even, I mean, you, so exactly the evil laugh. Thank you.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.480
 It's a necronomicon.

19:04.480 --> 19:10.480
 Well, the thing I, I'm sure we'll talk about it. Maybe not. It doesn't really matter. We see things

19:10.480 --> 19:16.720
 you and I, Michael, very differently about a lot of things politically and so on. The reason I like

19:16.720 --> 19:23.760
 you a lot, the reason I like the people I do in my life is there's a warmth, there's a kindness,

19:23.760 --> 19:27.760
 there's a humanity underneath it all. I don't really care what you believe. I don't care.

19:28.160 --> 19:33.760
 Like, I don't care what your Twitter says. You know, it's easy to mistake your Twitter to indicate

19:33.760 --> 19:41.280
 that there's not a deeply human love for humanity in there. And that's why I'm detecting that. I

19:41.280 --> 19:46.080
 think I would be able to detect that, Jeffrey Epstein, I'm just imagining the T1000.

19:48.240 --> 19:59.520
 Detected. Yes. I imagine, I hope I would be able to not detect that Epstein lacks that completely.

19:59.520 --> 20:06.880
 Even if he's charismatic in the humor he has, even if he is charismatic in the expression of

20:06.880 --> 20:14.720
 curiosity for science, which he did, he was curious about like, not just like boring minutiae of

20:14.720 --> 20:19.760
 science, he was interested about the big questions in science, which I could see that become exciting

20:19.760 --> 20:24.960
 to scientists like, oh, wow, here's a person who's thinking big. That's always exciting.

20:24.960 --> 20:30.000
 When somebody goes into a room and thinks about like, how do we solve intelligence?

20:30.000 --> 20:35.120
 How do we travel faster than the speed of light? That's exciting to people, especially people

20:35.120 --> 20:39.360
 with money, because it's like, all right, so we might be able to actually do big things here.

20:40.080 --> 20:44.800
 But you could see through the bullshit, the deadness in the eyes. I don't know.

20:45.600 --> 20:51.440
 So I think about that because I feel like I have the responsibility for me as an individual

20:51.440 --> 20:58.160
 to detect evil. So I, do you know who Michael Allig is? Okay, this is going to be a whole

20:58.160 --> 21:02.880
 long, this is going to be a Lex clips, but this is a whole long story. So there was a scene in New

21:02.880 --> 21:08.640
 York in the 90s called the club kids. And they would go out to different night clubs at night.

21:08.640 --> 21:15.360
 They would all dress in really kind of crazy costumes. And the costumes are all like, like

21:15.360 --> 21:19.600
 goofy and like just like an angel. This was dressed like a nurse. There's a juvenile

21:19.600 --> 21:25.040
 aspect to it. They're all taking, you know, ketamine and ecstasy to all hours. This is kind

21:25.040 --> 21:29.760
 of rape culture was coming up in there. And the head of it, and in fact, there's a,

21:31.200 --> 21:36.800
 a clip on YouTube, I think it was the Jane Whitney show of the club kids and Gigi Allen.

21:36.800 --> 21:43.280
 Gigi Allen is a, you know, kind of punk rock performer, hard rock performer who passed away.

21:43.280 --> 21:50.400
 And Gigi Allen was very aggressive and like a crazy person. My friend once saw him in a concert

21:50.400 --> 21:56.080
 and he took a dump on stage, smeared it all over his face, grabbed the girl from the audience,

21:56.080 --> 22:01.280
 gave her a big kiss. And as she walked by him, she just went like this, like, excuse me,

22:01.280 --> 22:05.200
 like went to the bathroom. So the audience is screaming at Gigi Allen because he's very

22:05.200 --> 22:09.120
 visibly over the top. Whereas you got a bunch of these kids dressed in these silly costumes,

22:09.120 --> 22:13.280
 you guys just having fun. Well, the head of the club kids, Michael Allig ended up killing someone.

22:13.840 --> 22:17.840
 There was a kid called Angel Menendez who hung around with them. He would always have angel

22:17.840 --> 22:25.280
 wings and boots. One time they're at Michael's condo with another, with a drug dealer named

22:25.280 --> 22:29.920
 freeze. They got into a fight. So Angel got hit in the head with a hammer. They kill him.

22:30.480 --> 22:35.360
 What are we going to do with the body? They put it on ice in the bathtub. They had a party.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.960
 So everyone's going to the bathroom while Angel's body is there. Michael got,

22:38.960 --> 22:42.400
 they're like, all right, we got to take care of this. Michael got extremely high in heroin,

22:43.200 --> 22:48.320
 had like a cutlery from Macy's, sawed the body in pieces, put it in a box.

22:49.120 --> 22:52.720
 They took him into cab. The cab driver helped them throw the body into the river.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.760
 And then Michael starts walking around Manhattan wearing Angel's boots

22:56.400 --> 23:00.560
 and would tell people, oh, I killed Angel. Now, because he was a super effeminate

23:00.560 --> 23:04.000
 over the top, like he would pee in people's beer kind of guy, everyone's like, oh,

23:04.000 --> 23:10.000
 God, Michael, like you and your stupid pranks. But it was true. And he got caught.

23:10.560 --> 23:17.120
 And he got sentenced to jail. So I was in a store in Manhattan in Soho. And it was one of those

23:17.120 --> 23:21.680
 stores. We have like all sorts of things for sale. And I saw a painting and it said malice.

23:21.680 --> 23:25.840
 And I'm like, wait, what? And it was M. Alec. It was a Michael Alec painting. He had painted

23:25.840 --> 23:29.760
 while in jail. So my mom bought it for me for my birthday. I don't remember what birthday it was.

23:29.760 --> 23:34.560
 And I started writing him in prison. He was going to write a memoir called Aligula, which is clever.

23:35.200 --> 23:39.760
 And then I actually went to visit him. I'm like, I want to see what this person's like. Because

23:39.760 --> 23:44.960
 on one hand, he's king of New York nightlife, this goofy person. And it's also kind of ironic that

23:44.960 --> 23:48.240
 Gigi Allen is like, maybe he's gross. He's not killing anybody. He's probably going to count

23:48.240 --> 23:52.240
 off the stage and Michael Alec actually did kill someone and then bragged about it tongue in cheek.

23:52.240 --> 24:02.400
 So, but meeting him, he passed away last December on Christmas, actually, on Christmas 2020.

24:04.160 --> 24:10.640
 He was clearly a sociopath. And I'd never met a sociopath before. Now, a lot of times we'll read

24:10.640 --> 24:15.120
 these like, you'll take a Buzzfeed quiz, like, are you a sociopath? And it's like, oh, my feelings

24:15.120 --> 24:22.480
 weren't hurt when I was mean to someone. It's not a thin line between like, me and you and him.

24:22.480 --> 24:27.200
 It's a thick, thick line. Because when you're talking to someone like that, at least in this

24:27.200 --> 24:30.640
 specific case, he was being very friendly. He wasn't, and it's not like he was going to kill

24:30.640 --> 24:37.680
 anyone or as a threat to me. But there's that sense like something's really off here. And he

24:37.680 --> 24:45.120
 was talking to me about how after he had killed Angel, he would just talk about it because he

24:45.120 --> 24:49.440
 felt so much guilt. He just wanted to get caught. It's like, no, no, no, you what he was describing

24:49.440 --> 24:55.280
 wasn't guilt. He was describing just he didn't like the the knife over his head, like waiting to

24:55.280 --> 25:00.000
 get caught. I'm like, you don't even know what guilt is. So it was kind of like, oh, wow. So

25:01.280 --> 25:06.080
 as for Jeffrey, but the thing is, Michael Alec isn't was in a very low social position.

25:06.080 --> 25:11.680
 And the thing is, when someone is powerful, very high status, and they do something,

25:12.800 --> 25:20.880
 we are as kind of hierarchical animals, we kind of defer to their norms. So if you're at a party

25:21.520 --> 25:27.200
 with, let's suppose, either us, and it's like a Jeffrey Epstein party, and everyone at the party

25:27.200 --> 25:32.480
 is doing some sort of weird drug we've never heard of, we wouldn't really feel comfortable

25:32.480 --> 25:40.320
 judging them, because like their norms kind of become the norm for that space. The lesson for

25:40.320 --> 25:47.200
 me about Jeffrey Epstein, there's a lot of them, because I think this, to me, the biggest moment

25:47.200 --> 25:53.600
 was the Amy Rohrbach situation. Amy Rohrbach was caught on a hot mic, saying that they had all

25:53.600 --> 25:59.280
 the goods on him, they had all the names, and that Buckingham Palace call them, they killed the story

25:59.280 --> 26:04.480
 because they weren't going to get a Meghan Markle interview out of it. So that the willingness of

26:05.200 --> 26:11.280
 those in power to do the wrong thing for the flimsiest pretext, which I think was a big

26:11.280 --> 26:19.200
 important lesson, also the fact that no one at ABC had any consequences for this. In fact, the only

26:19.200 --> 26:25.040
 person who got in trouble for all this was someone who used to work at ABC, went to I believe CBS,

26:25.040 --> 26:29.120
 and they got fired from CBS because apparently they had access to footage at one point, even though

26:29.120 --> 26:34.640
 they weren't the ones who had leaked it. So whistleblowers are like the only, for example,

26:34.640 --> 26:40.400
 the case in Eric Garner, the guy who was selling Lucy cigarettes in New York City,

26:41.360 --> 26:45.840
 who was arrested, he had a heart attack or whatever it was on the way to jail, he died.

26:45.840 --> 26:50.160
 The only person, so the cops had a situation there, the only person who had gotten in trouble

26:50.160 --> 26:56.080
 because of that was the guy filming it, like he went to jail. So I think there is, there's a lesson

26:56.080 --> 27:03.280
 in terms of, we look at Julian Assange, right? There's a huge amount of power exercised by elites

27:03.280 --> 27:07.280
 to make sure that what is done in the cover of darkness remains in the cover of darkness.

27:07.840 --> 27:12.480
 And also Kevin McCarthy, who was currently the house minority leader, leader of the Republicans,

27:12.480 --> 27:18.800
 he wrote a letter to ABC News, like, you had this guy, maybe you couldn't call in the authorities,

27:18.800 --> 27:22.560
 but you could have leaked it to somebody, why hasn't anything come forward? Nothing happened

27:22.560 --> 27:26.640
 as a result of this. We also have to keep in mind that the longest serving Republican

27:26.640 --> 27:30.080
 Speaker of the House in history, Dennis Hastert, went to jail because of things related to

27:30.080 --> 27:35.520
 pedophilia and things like that. So as Russians, and this is something I think you and I've mentioned

27:35.520 --> 27:43.520
 before, Americans are very naive, often decreasingly so, about the nature of evil. They think an

27:43.520 --> 27:49.200
 evil person is someone who's like getting kickbacks or, you know, like the Cuomos are colluding,

27:49.200 --> 27:54.800
 something like that. I would hardly even call that evil. No, no, this is the sort of things

27:54.800 --> 27:59.040
 that are so depraved that you would never think about it in a million years in your own home.

27:59.040 --> 28:05.280
 You don't think in these terms. And I think they get off on doing things that if the average person

28:05.280 --> 28:09.440
 heard about it, the average person would be shocked because that gives them this sense of we're

28:09.440 --> 28:14.320
 above them, we're different from them. The rules don't apply to us. There's a lot to say here.

28:14.320 --> 28:19.280
 So what is the norm thing you said at a party? It's really interesting for an anarchist to say

28:19.280 --> 28:25.760
 that. Well, no, it's this. No, well, I know, I know. I'm not sorry. That came off as criticism.

28:25.760 --> 28:35.120
 I meant it as harsh criticism. No, I think about that a lot. Like, as, you know, I found myself

28:35.120 --> 28:41.680
 in situations where I'm invited to these kinds of parties where people have nice things,

28:42.320 --> 28:48.160
 and I find it deeply uncomfortable for that reason. I don't want to be sort of an activist

28:48.160 --> 28:54.400
 that goes in and ruins a party. That's, that's a, I think that's a, that's not the courageous act.

28:55.040 --> 28:59.680
 Neither is it courageous when everyone's doing some weird drug that you mentioned to join in,

28:59.680 --> 29:09.040
 I think. Courageous is more being your, remaining yourself, sticking to your principles calmly

29:09.040 --> 29:12.560
 in that room where everybody is doing the drug and just don't do the drug.

29:12.560 --> 29:16.960
 Yeah, sure. Don't make a scene about it, but also don't, don't do it. And I think

29:16.960 --> 29:22.240
 that little act of courage over time is the way you resist Jeff Epstein. That exactly the thing

29:22.240 --> 29:28.400
 you said is, is probably the situation where charisma works. So one charismatic person gets

29:28.400 --> 29:36.640
 a little crowd going and the crowd is everybody sort of establishes a norm at the little crowd.

29:37.280 --> 29:42.080
 And yes, there could be some dynamics that allow that norm to be established. Like you said,

29:42.080 --> 29:48.480
 like rich and powerful people might enjoy being rich and powerful and better than everybody

29:48.480 --> 29:56.800
 else kind of, kind of thing. But like I, especially for scientists, I thought they should have

29:56.800 --> 30:03.360
 integrity and courage enough to, to see through that, not again as an activist, like so you can

30:03.360 --> 30:08.720
 tweet about it, how courageous you are. But just literally, see, there's something off here.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.880
 There's something off here and I'm not going to participate.

30:10.880 --> 30:15.120
 I'm going to defend these scientists because something off, first of all.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.440
 You're always defending academia is disgusting.

30:17.440 --> 30:22.800
 It's my favorite thing. I think that first of all, this is going to sound like a joke and it's not.

30:22.800 --> 30:29.040
 I bet you 90% of those MIT scientists are on the spectrum. So everyone they're going to meet is

30:29.040 --> 30:33.120
 going to be off, right? So I'm sure part of their brain is like, okay, this person's weird.

30:33.120 --> 30:36.720
 This is just them being on the spectrum. Like the lights, but spectrum. I couldn't even finish

30:36.720 --> 30:46.640
 the joke. Okay, guys. Number two is off. We, we tend to, there's this poem. I forget who wrote it.

30:46.640 --> 30:53.440
 It was like Nick Cave or something. And it was describing like, I think it was Goebbels. Hair,

30:53.440 --> 31:00.720
 normal, height, normal, weight, normal. What do you expect? Horns, right? So when you meet someone,

31:00.720 --> 31:04.880
 you think something's off. There's going to be a bell curve of what that could be, right? It could

31:04.880 --> 31:09.840
 be that they're twitchy or maybe they're completely social. And then you have Jeffrey Epstein over

31:09.840 --> 31:14.960
 here. You're going to need a lot of evidence to be like, Oh, I feel something off there for this

31:14.960 --> 31:21.200
 guy's the head of an international, you know, sex trafficking ring. So yeah, you might be like, okay,

31:21.200 --> 31:25.600
 but at the same time, if their extended relationship is this guy is interested in my work,

31:25.600 --> 31:29.920
 he's going to fund my work, and I don't have to give him anything in return. He's clearly intelligent.

31:29.920 --> 31:35.920
 He's appreciating it. And being a scientist is a thankless job. I know what it's like as an author

31:35.920 --> 31:39.760
 when I was writing Dear Reader, the North Korea book, my friends are sick of hearing all these

31:39.760 --> 31:43.040
 North Korea anecdotes, because at a certain point it's like, okay, we get it. Just save it for the

31:43.040 --> 31:46.560
 book. And you know, you got to be in that lab, you're looking at the springtails, whatever it is

31:46.560 --> 31:50.800
 you're looking at, no one knows what a springtail is. I just disagree with you. So that'd be

31:50.800 --> 31:55.840
 interesting to draw the distinction between science and writing, because the scientific process

31:55.840 --> 32:02.640
 itself is fun as fuck. It's you're solving little puzzles. Sure. So like, in itself, it's fun. So

32:02.640 --> 32:10.080
 like, it's rewarding. Like the reason you go into science is you can continue really without a boss

32:10.080 --> 32:18.000
 to continue having fun and solving puzzles. That's, that's literally so like, unless you become cynical

32:18.000 --> 32:22.960
 and tired of the whole thing. So the, the people, the administration, or when you're running a large

32:22.960 --> 32:27.360
 lab, and you what you get sick of is the emails and the meetings and all that kind of stuff,

32:27.360 --> 32:35.280
 the actual act of being in the lab is still fun as fuck. If you allow it to be writing, I feel like

32:35.280 --> 32:41.680
 it's, there's more priority to publishing. Like, would you enjoy it, the tree falling in the forest,

32:41.680 --> 32:46.400
 would you still enjoy any of the books you've written if they never got published?

32:46.960 --> 32:51.280
 Not to the same extent that even close. Right. Right. I think that's the thing about science.

32:51.840 --> 32:55.920
 It's almost like you get a peek into the mysterious. Yeah, but this is okay. Let me,

32:55.920 --> 33:02.960
 this is where I'm coming from. Since moving to Austin, I bought 150, over 150 plants.

33:02.960 --> 33:09.920
 How are you doing the politician thing? Look, let me be clear. All right. It's not.

33:11.120 --> 33:17.120
 You are running in 2024. This is very interesting. I bought 150 succulents from my house. They're,

33:17.120 --> 33:19.440
 they're thriving here in Austin as they wouldn't have in Brooklyn.

33:19.440 --> 33:24.160
 You have a great video about it. Yeah. One of those plants I have is the photo I took on my

33:24.160 --> 33:28.480
 Instagram. There's no other photos on the whole internet. None of my friends care. Or they care

33:28.480 --> 33:32.880
 like ostensibly, but like, oh, that's cool. Like I have a better plant collection in my house than

33:32.880 --> 33:37.520
 like almost any botanical succulent collection than any botanical garden in America than probably

33:37.520 --> 33:42.880
 the Huntington and no one cares. This is what ego looks like, by the way. I can prove it to you.

33:42.880 --> 33:48.080
 No, I know, but you don't have to rub it in. Well, they have a big budget. I don't. So if I can put

33:48.080 --> 33:53.760
 it together, they should be able to. Right. So I can only imagine that a scientist who studied,

33:53.760 --> 34:01.120
 you know, the spiders that look like ants, like at a certain, like, oh, and this species does this

34:01.120 --> 34:05.520
 with the gender dimorphism, their friends are only going to care so much. So if you meet someone who

34:05.520 --> 34:09.840
 has a lot of money who now cares about ant spiders, it's going to be exciting.

34:09.840 --> 34:17.520
 It will be very exciting. But I just wanted to push back on the, I think the act itself

34:17.520 --> 34:22.960
 should be the biggest reward. I think you're always safe. We're talking about goodness being

34:22.960 --> 34:29.840
 a safe default. I think it's a good default for, for plants and for writing and for science

34:30.480 --> 34:36.480
 is to just enjoying the act, even if nobody cares. Okay, this is where this, okay, now I'm even,

34:36.480 --> 34:40.720
 now I'm wondering why I'm pushing back so hard and I realized what it was because

34:41.600 --> 34:46.880
 I've made this point several times and I'm glad I can make it again. There's this window of time

34:46.880 --> 34:51.840
 that happened in my life. And I know it happens to a lot of people when you're in your like 24 to

34:51.840 --> 34:57.680
 27, 28, right? So 21 to 24, like you still have your friends from college, so on and so forth,

34:57.680 --> 35:02.880
 right? But then it's kind of like a poker game. And, you know, every so often people cash out,

35:02.880 --> 35:07.600
 they're like, I'm out, I'm out, they get married, they get a job, they move. And if you are someone

35:07.600 --> 35:13.440
 who is a young ambitious creative, that window is a very rough one, because you're doing the right

35:13.440 --> 35:18.080
 thing, right? And you're not being, you know, drug addict, you're not being a philanderer,

35:18.080 --> 35:22.800
 not that those things are wrong, but just like you're playing by the rules, you're creating your

35:22.800 --> 35:27.520
 stuff, what you want to be known for, contribution you want to make for the world. And no one cares

35:27.520 --> 35:34.560
 and it gets very lonely. And there's this very emotional disconnect about how is it that I'm

35:34.560 --> 35:40.080
 creating and I'm working hard, and I'm making something happen, and it's just radio silence.

35:40.080 --> 35:46.480
 So that I don't think it's that easy when you're, you're the scientist, not me, when you don't have

35:46.480 --> 35:54.000
 any kind of external validation, humans only have so much fuel. Nothing worth having is easy,

35:54.000 --> 35:59.440
 Michael. By the way, yesterday, talked on the phone with a person, he said he was deeply moved

35:59.440 --> 36:06.240
 the first time you mentioned this age group of 24 to 27. And he's like, he, he's 26, he said.

36:07.120 --> 36:13.520
 And he feels the full responsibility of that and the excitement. So he left his like corporate

36:13.520 --> 36:18.880
 type of job to pursue something that he's really passionate about. And that, that was like,

36:18.880 --> 36:22.960
 you were an inspiration to him, which I was deeply saddened by that.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.240
 I also inspired Michael Alex.

36:28.560 --> 36:33.920
 The amount of mass murder, those that were inspired by you will eventually lead to is,

36:33.920 --> 36:40.880
 is truly horrifying. What were we talking about? So Jeff, one thing I wanted to ask you,

36:40.880 --> 36:49.680
 so let's put scientists aside, what about like, world leaders, Bill Clinton, your favorite person,

36:50.400 --> 36:56.480
 why would he fly with Jeffrey Epstein? Why would he interact with that guy?

36:57.280 --> 37:04.720
 I mean, don't you think that that's kind of the deal that I'm the president and I get

37:04.720 --> 37:08.240
 big and powerful people fly around their jets and that's the symbiotic relationship?

37:08.240 --> 37:12.560
 Yeah, but don't you also have a good BS detector? Like,

37:13.520 --> 37:17.520
 don't you have a good detector for people who just want to be in your presence?

37:18.240 --> 37:22.640
 Like, I already understand that there's people like this out there. Like,

37:22.640 --> 37:29.200
 there's people that kind of want to use me for stuff. And you mean Tim Dillon?

37:29.200 --> 37:38.480
 Tim Dillon. I love that guy. You guys met? We haven't met yet here. You haven't met?

37:38.480 --> 37:41.920
 Yeah. We met before in New York, but we had not since I moved here.

37:41.920 --> 37:46.560
 Yeah. So you should be able to detect that there's those people and there's the people

37:46.560 --> 37:50.000
 that have kindness in their heart, even if they can benefit from the interaction with you,

37:50.000 --> 37:53.120
 but they have like, they're good human beings. I feel like you want to,

37:53.760 --> 37:57.280
 you run into a lot of trouble if you surround yourself or have any people

37:57.280 --> 38:02.160
 that are manipulative. But I think you make a bad example because like,

38:02.160 --> 38:05.840
 let's look at Clinton and let's look at Obama, right? So Obama,

38:05.840 --> 38:08.960
 even though their politics are very close, I'd say in many ways,

38:08.960 --> 38:13.520
 Obama is apparent. We don't know. I don't know either of them. But to me,

38:13.520 --> 38:17.200
 it seems very apparent that he's very similar behind closed doors as you in front of the camp.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.120
 Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's baroque to me. Oh, yeah.

38:19.120 --> 38:27.040
 Yeah. He's good. Yeah. Clinton seems very clearly to be much more of a performer.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.680
 He's in front of the cameras. He puts on a roll, but behind the cameras,

38:29.680 --> 38:33.280
 he very much has a temper. He's known for that. He's much more of a lech.

38:34.480 --> 38:38.160
 What's that? Perfect. Oh, lech with an E.

38:38.160 --> 38:43.520
 L.E.T.C.H. Yeah. Oh, cool. Lech. Is that like a, that's a cool term. So I can use that on the

38:43.520 --> 38:48.000
 internet. Like you're a lech. Yeah, you can use that on the internet. You're a dirty lech.

38:48.000 --> 38:54.800
 Well, it's dirty. It's implied. Oh, so it's okay. Yeah. So being redundant. Yeah. It just feels

38:54.800 --> 39:00.960
 like he needs an adjective to give it more power. I'm sorry. So Clinton is a lech. Right. So you

39:00.960 --> 39:07.280
 can see how there's people who want to meet, you know, the surface, Bill Clinton, and I'm sure

39:07.280 --> 39:11.760
 that gets old for him because he has to be on. But then there's the good old boys where he could

39:11.760 --> 39:16.880
 be a pervert and this guy's like, yeah, I know what it's like. And then he feels like he's himself.

39:16.880 --> 39:22.000
 But I'm all speculating. I mean, I don't know what Bill Clinton is like, what was in it for him.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.320
 He certainly could afford private jets if he wanted to. There's no shortage of people who

39:26.320 --> 39:31.920
 want to fly around the world to give speeches, you know, at, you know. Can he satisfy the lech

39:31.920 --> 39:38.000
 within, without hanging out with the Jeffrey Epstein's of the world? Like, can he get, I mean,

39:38.000 --> 39:43.040
 this is the Monica Lewinsky question to me. I'm confused by all of this. Can he get

39:43.040 --> 39:51.760
 women in a legitimate way of like, not using his power, not hanging out with these shady,

39:52.400 --> 39:59.360
 rich people, but just like having a normal mistress like JFK. Well, JFK a lot. I know,

39:59.360 --> 40:05.040
 I understand that. But in a normal way, or I don't, I don't know enough. I don't understand

40:05.680 --> 40:10.720
 the Clinton psychology. First of all, the fact that you're hooking up with someone who's close

40:10.720 --> 40:16.320
 to your daughter's age to me, I think was is inherently disturbing. But she's an adult. So,

40:16.320 --> 40:22.800
 okay, that's not that, that, you know, beyond the pale. But also the idea that, oh, if I don't

40:23.920 --> 40:29.040
 physically fornicate with you, it's not cheating. Like that, whatever you tell yourself, or like,

40:29.040 --> 40:35.680
 if I don't ejaculate, it's not cheating. Like these rules that maybe it leads to some kind of

40:35.680 --> 40:41.200
 slippery slope, like you start not having the rules of who you fool. I mean, if you told your

40:41.200 --> 40:46.560
 wife, like, listen, it wasn't cheating, she only, you know, performed on me, you're going to say

40:46.560 --> 40:51.840
 this with a straight face. Like, do you at a certain point when something is so brazen, you

40:51.840 --> 40:58.000
 wonder if the person even has to believe it because who you fooling. But like, we started this,

40:58.000 --> 41:03.360
 this conversation with them, even there is a line between young women older than 18 and

41:03.360 --> 41:10.320
 young teens, like 12, 13 kids. Have you ever, when's the last, oh, because it's

41:10.320 --> 41:15.840
 different for you because you're at MIT. I was hanging out with Blair White, and she had a

41:15.840 --> 41:20.800
 couple of fans with her of hers, and they were like 22, 23. And they were like children to me.

41:21.520 --> 41:29.200
 Like, I'm like, to me, as someone who is in his late 60s, to look at these people as adults,

41:29.200 --> 41:34.640
 like, they look completely like kids. So that, of course, there's exceptions. Like,

41:34.640 --> 41:41.760
 I've interacted with a young 20, 20 year olds that are like, you're way more mature than I'll

41:41.760 --> 41:48.320
 ever be. Like the wisdom that comes out of them is quite fascinating. Visually, the energy and

41:48.320 --> 41:54.800
 the way they look, they look so young to me and the way they carry themselves. It was the idea

41:54.800 --> 42:01.600
 that my instinct was, let's tuck you in and read you a bedtime story, not let me like touch you

42:01.600 --> 42:07.840
 or something. It was just like, it was just wouldn't enter my head. So there's, but the thing is,

42:08.560 --> 42:11.920
 is it possible that in order to want to be the president, you have to be a crazy person?

42:12.960 --> 42:18.160
 That you have some kind of weird view on power. It could be a power thing, too.

42:18.720 --> 42:19.360
 Yeah.

42:19.360 --> 42:21.520
 Like, like you can get away with stuff.

42:21.520 --> 42:27.840
 Like, if I was Clinton's age, nothing about Monica Lewinsky to me would be attractive.

42:27.840 --> 42:31.440
 And also, I would just feel bad for her because I know she's going to catch feelings.

42:32.160 --> 42:32.800
 And it's kind of like...

42:32.800 --> 42:34.160
 Catch feelings. Yeah, sure.

42:34.160 --> 42:34.960
 This is virtual.

42:34.960 --> 42:38.800
 It's just like, why would I do this to this kid? For what? Just because I want to get some,

42:38.800 --> 42:40.880
 like, momentary pleasure. Come on.

42:41.440 --> 42:46.400
 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I'm sure she looked gorgeous to him in the moment.

42:46.400 --> 42:52.320
 Well, let me ask, we started talking about beauty. Who are you wearing?

42:56.000 --> 43:01.440
 So as a model, you usually don't have a shirt on when you're modeling.

43:02.640 --> 43:05.040
 So it's nice to see you dressed up today.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.080
 Nice and warm.

43:10.080 --> 43:15.280
 This is because so for those who don't know, Russians don't celebrate Christmas,

43:15.280 --> 43:17.600
 obviously the Soviet Union Christmas was illegal.

43:17.600 --> 43:22.240
 No Thanksgiving, basically no major holidays where everyone gets together.

43:22.240 --> 43:23.440
 This is the one holiday.

43:23.440 --> 43:24.080
 Yeah, New Year's.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.440
 It's the one holiday.

43:25.440 --> 43:29.280
 Instead of, I remember as a kid, instead of Santa Claus, we have Diedmeros,

43:29.280 --> 43:31.040
 who's the same thing basically.

43:31.040 --> 43:34.800
 It's like Android and iPhone. It's like a cheap version of Christmas.

43:34.800 --> 43:37.440
 He's got this girl with him. She's like Snow White or whatever.

43:37.440 --> 43:41.360
 And Russian kids, they go to sleep on December 31st and they wake up

43:41.360 --> 43:43.040
 January and they have a present under their pillow.

43:43.040 --> 43:48.400
 And I remember as a kid, this happened once and it just blew my mind, you know what I mean?

43:48.400 --> 43:52.000
 It's just like, I went to bed, my dad's like, oh, you know, you're going to have

43:52.000 --> 43:54.240
 Diedmeros is going to bring your present if you've been a good kid.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.840
 I'm like, I think I was a good kid.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.800
 But you don't even remember a year of your life when you're four.

43:59.520 --> 44:00.000
 You remember like two weeks.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.360
 You remember those moments.

44:01.360 --> 44:05.040
 Yeah. And then I woke up and there was a present and I fell out and I was,

44:05.040 --> 44:06.160
 it just blew my mind.

44:06.160 --> 44:08.080
 And that building is still there.

44:08.080 --> 44:14.400
 1461 Sherpa Parkway in Brooklyn. And it's just also funny.

44:15.520 --> 44:19.200
 What I really like about kids, you know, being an uncle now is kid logic

44:19.840 --> 44:25.600
 because they have very little bit of data, but they're using logic to make sense of it.

44:25.600 --> 44:29.760
 And sometimes it gives them the completely wrong conclusions for the completely right reasons.

44:30.320 --> 44:35.760
 I remember, you know, my bedroom as a kid was right off the kitchen

44:35.760 --> 44:39.360
 and I'd be scared the dark a little bit so they'd leave the light on the kitchen while I went to

44:39.360 --> 44:44.960
 sleep. And at the same time, my parents had told me, you don't leave the lights on the house.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.280
 It costs money waste electricity, right?

44:47.280 --> 44:51.760
 So I would be worried because I'm like, oh my God, my parents leave the lights on the kitchen

44:51.760 --> 44:56.480
 all night. And now it's costing them so much money, not realizing that, you know,

44:56.480 --> 44:58.720
 five minutes after I'm out, obviously they're turning the lights off.

44:58.720 --> 45:01.120
 But like in my kid logic, this was a concern of mine.

45:01.120 --> 45:07.600
 Yeah. And memories work that same way. I have a collection of memories that are stitched together

45:07.600 --> 45:12.560
 logically somehow, but they also don't really make sense. There's a few defining things.

45:12.560 --> 45:21.520
 So I grew up in Russia and experienced a lot of new years in Russia. There's a lot of incredible

45:21.520 --> 45:27.360
 things about that tradition that just warms my heart. So one, as a kid, you mentioned these

45:27.360 --> 45:32.720
 kind of stories. That's the one night of the year that kids are allowed to be adults

45:33.360 --> 45:38.720
 in the following way, like in kid logic. You're allowed to stay up all night.

45:38.720 --> 45:43.760
 Oh yeah, okay. Those, as late as you want, which actually ends up being, you're not used to.

45:43.760 --> 45:45.760
 Eleven. Right, you're out.

45:45.760 --> 45:52.240
 You crash. But no, you get to, you know, two, three, four at night, you stay up and when you get to

45:52.240 --> 45:58.000
 witness, it's almost like Alice in Wonderland goes into this world. You get to witness what

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
 does the adult world really like? Now, obviously it's not an actual adult world.

46:03.760 --> 46:11.920
 Marryment, like laughing, fighting, arguing, but also like in our case, like singing and

46:13.200 --> 46:20.640
 like, yeah, arguing like philosophical stuff, but also like, if I may, how would I describe it?

46:20.640 --> 46:26.800
 This is also probably a little bit Russian culture, but like flirtation in all of its forms,

46:27.360 --> 46:31.440
 meaning like men and women just being like, because they dress up. Yeah, yeah.

46:31.440 --> 46:37.680
 It's like, it's, it's joy. It's like, you get to show off like dresses, whatever you got,

46:37.680 --> 46:45.520
 you show it off, this is fun. And then men too, just like friends, laughing, like arguing, just

46:45.520 --> 46:50.080
 showing off the best they got with delicious food. Obviously that there's a Thanksgiving

46:50.080 --> 46:56.000
 element there where there's just so many, just you bring out all the traditional stuff,

46:56.800 --> 47:02.720
 the, the, yes, salad, just everything, just the full thing with the desserts and obviously the

47:02.720 --> 47:10.640
 vodka, a lot of vodka. And at the time, so this is the Soviet Union, like the biggest stuff,

47:10.640 --> 47:16.640
 and this is so sad that these are the things that I remember is like Coca Cola. Oh yeah.

47:16.640 --> 47:23.760
 Like American, like that, I'll probably kill somebody for Dr. Pepper. It's so fascinating that

47:24.960 --> 47:31.600
 you take it for granted, sort of the results of capitalist society, the material things that

47:31.600 --> 47:40.800
 are created, but that was the ultimate happiness is to experience this new thing, sugar, I don't know,

47:40.800 --> 47:45.360
 you know, there's a scarcity. There's like communist colon check Republic.

47:46.720 --> 47:50.240
 So basically they try to rip off Coke. Yeah. And it's just like,

47:51.040 --> 47:55.440
 like they just threw whatever they could together. And it was a very poor knockoff,

47:55.440 --> 47:58.560
 as you can imagine, I forget what it's called. And all the Czech people right now are getting

47:58.560 --> 48:04.240
 very angry at me because I can't think of it, but they have it now. And the slogan is good or weird.

48:05.600 --> 48:10.400
 So it's like this. So they kind of reclaimed this kind of hipster soda. Yeah. Oh, that's awesome.

48:10.400 --> 48:17.120
 It's almost like a parody. Right. Yeah. But I think the thing I really remember is the camaraderie,

48:18.160 --> 48:26.960
 like the love for each other and neighbors too. Like you and I are neighbors now. We don't see

48:26.960 --> 48:31.920
 each other that often. I hope that changes, but a lot of it is also me. I'm just a deep introvert.

48:33.200 --> 48:36.800
 You're also the hardest working person I know. Yeah. So it's time, but you know,

48:36.800 --> 48:44.800
 like, it's not like I'll go in the middle of the night at like 4am and go to 711 and just sit there

48:45.840 --> 48:52.560
 sipping a slurpee for an hour thinking about life. It's not like I'm always working. Yeah,

48:52.560 --> 48:56.320
 I don't know. What I mean is like you get to meet your neighbors and you get to experience their

48:57.440 --> 49:03.040
 highs and their lows and you get to bitch about life, about government, about corruption, about

49:03.040 --> 49:08.560
 the unfairness of life together. Well, it's also, I think, what people don't appreciate as Americans

49:08.560 --> 49:15.520
 is it's very rare in Russia to have a safe space. Yeah. So you know that January 1st,

49:16.080 --> 49:20.000
 no one's going to snitch on you. You know, they're not going to be informants probably,

49:20.000 --> 49:25.520
 so you can vent and, you know, that's the thing with people in totalitarian countries.

49:25.520 --> 49:29.520
 You have to have the public facing persona and then behind closed doors is very different.

49:29.520 --> 49:36.240
 It all comes out. I also remember the arguments and I've been going on Clubhouse recently into

49:36.240 --> 49:43.920
 Russian rooms. Oh, Jesus. Well, just to practice Russian. And they, it's so beautiful to watch.

49:43.920 --> 49:48.960
 I mean, Clubhouse is a very specific collection of Russian people. Maybe it's a little bit

49:48.960 --> 49:56.880
 political, but, and they're a little bit older. And it's interesting to watch how much they love

49:56.880 --> 50:04.640
 to argue. Russian love to argue. And so like it will be literally, you could think of it as a

50:04.640 --> 50:11.440
 nonlinear dynamical system, okay, from an engineering perspective. Whenever any positive

50:11.440 --> 50:17.120
 topic comes up, you could feel the skepticism and then wait a minute, this is not good.

50:17.120 --> 50:24.400
 And they'll start like, perturbing it until you're like, they'll find some way to say,

50:24.400 --> 50:28.880
 like, come on now, that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. And then it goes back into argument.

50:28.880 --> 50:34.880
 It's so fun to watch because in one sense, you could see it as negative. In another,

50:34.880 --> 50:41.200
 you could see it as free to express yourself because it feels like you can solve a lot of

50:41.200 --> 50:48.400
 problems by allowing yourself to just be emotional, both emotional and say hard truth and all those

50:48.400 --> 50:54.960
 kinds of things without like, without prodding yourself on the back about it. But also,

50:55.840 --> 51:01.440
 it just sort of those Russian rooms make me realize how constrained American speeches,

51:02.000 --> 51:06.480
 how careful people are in the way they express it, even the Michael Mouses in the world.

51:06.480 --> 51:13.600
 You're constantly being like nuanced. There they just say crazy shit. Oh yeah. And then

51:13.600 --> 51:18.240
 they correct themselves and make fun of themselves and they completely shift opinions a minute

51:18.240 --> 51:25.120
 later. And it's chaos. Yeah. And it's, I mean, it's beautiful. So I love that that culture is

51:25.120 --> 51:32.080
 funny given the current regime in Russia, like how that's coupled with how people are talking and

51:33.520 --> 51:39.440
 yeah, I don't know. And I have those memories of childhood of friends that I had of just having

51:39.440 --> 51:46.720
 that true freedom of talking and somehow that leads to deep bonds together. When the life,

51:46.720 --> 51:52.720
 when you're poor, when life is, has a lot of elements that are unfair, when the government

51:52.720 --> 51:57.760
 is corrupt, there's sort of, it's just, especially in the Soviet Union, there's uncertainty about

51:57.760 --> 52:03.040
 the future, all of it, you just get closer together, like penguins huddling together in the cold,

52:03.040 --> 52:08.160
 like that March of the Penguins movie, that I don't know. The friends I've gotten there,

52:08.160 --> 52:17.840
 like, I get emotional every time I kind of think about those friends because it was so close.

52:17.840 --> 52:22.560
 That friendship was so fucking close. But I just really hate the Russian cynicism.

52:22.560 --> 52:28.480
 Well, I know you do. And I actually disagree with you about it. You see it as cynicism. I see it as

52:29.360 --> 52:35.200
 waves on top of the water, like surface cynicism and the depths as I see the beauty of the Russian

52:35.200 --> 52:41.760
 soul. So we, yes, that cynicism can negatively affect a lot of people. I think you've talked

52:41.760 --> 52:49.920
 about as a parent being cynical about the world and then you have dire negative consequences

52:49.920 --> 52:54.800
 on your children. They become cynical. They don't ever take big risks or take on bold things.

52:54.800 --> 53:02.480
 And I have those arguments because the cynicism is exhausting, it's destructive, it's anti creative.

53:02.480 --> 53:07.280
 But so in their perspective is this is what the Russian folks would say. Well, yes, that's our

53:07.280 --> 53:13.840
 role, like being cynical is being reasonable about the world. But it's not. It's completely

53:13.840 --> 53:20.400
 unreasonable. It's a complete lie. No, I know. But their argument is, yes, but we're giving you

53:20.400 --> 53:27.040
 this force and it's your job to resist against it. So it's a test. I love the idea that if you're

53:27.040 --> 53:31.280
 going to be creative and innovative, you don't have enough up against you. Yeah, exactly. This

53:31.280 --> 53:35.360
 is exactly it. It's not hard enough already that I want to be an author. Now you got to be like,

53:35.360 --> 53:41.920
 well, let me just put some fire ants on top of it. So I just want to separate. I agree with you

53:41.920 --> 53:49.440
 that the cynicism is bad and destructive. But the idea that life is suffering and

53:50.880 --> 53:55.680
 thinking from that as a first principle, I think there's a lot of beauty to be discovered through

53:55.680 --> 54:04.320
 that. So there's a cynicism and then there's horrible message. Life is suffering. No, not.

54:04.960 --> 54:08.640
 Well, yeah, I mean, Camus. Camus doesn't think that.

54:11.040 --> 54:18.480
 Now we're going into definitions of suffering then, because absurd. Life is absurd and life

54:18.480 --> 54:22.080
 is suffering are not even close to the same concept. Well, then you're just defining the

54:22.080 --> 54:26.720
 terms differently. Well, that's because they're different terms. Well, it's always love and beauty.

54:26.720 --> 54:30.960
 But so let's define. Okay, you're selling if your baby's in the crib, like with a fever,

54:30.960 --> 54:34.560
 you're like, oh, that's absurd. No, it's the kid's suffering. It's not the same.

54:34.560 --> 54:40.400
 So yes, starvation. You've been for white pill research and a lot of actual specifically defined

54:40.400 --> 54:48.560
 suffering. Sure. But also a lot of wonderful things. Right. Yeah, yeah. But the word suffering

54:48.560 --> 54:55.360
 can encompass more than just specifically starving. And it could, it can encompass,

54:55.360 --> 55:00.000
 like a lot of the philosophers talk about it, it encompass like philosophical suffering,

55:00.000 --> 55:05.520
 the fact that there isn't, if you're not careful, life can appear meaningless,

55:05.520 --> 55:12.240
 you can fall into a nihilistic view. It's difficult to have the responsibility of freedom

55:12.240 --> 55:18.160
 to act in this world, because you can fuck up in so many different ways. And then life is seemingly

55:18.160 --> 55:26.160
 unfair in the sense that good things happen for no apparent reason and terrible things

55:26.160 --> 55:30.960
 happen for no apparent reason. Like what, you know, it's the old religious question of why does evil

55:32.160 --> 55:36.080
 happen in the world? Why do terrible things happen in the world? There's a book called Six

55:36.080 --> 55:41.440
 Word Memoirs, right, where all these different personalities are awesome. Were you in it? No.

55:41.440 --> 55:46.640
 I'm in it with, so you had to basically write your autobiography in six words and mine was

55:46.640 --> 55:52.080
 good things happen to bad people. You see, there you go. There's humor. Yes. That's your

55:52.080 --> 55:56.000
 way of dealing with the suffering. But I don't think life is, if life was suffering, we wouldn't

55:56.000 --> 56:02.720
 be able to have happiness. No, out of suffering, happiness is born. So like it's, it's the ups

56:02.720 --> 56:08.880
 and downs of life. And what it means like, I don't, this, I just, I don't agree at all

56:08.880 --> 56:13.680
 that you need to suffer in order to be happy. I agree you have to work hard, but that's not

56:13.680 --> 56:18.160
 the same thing. Yeah. All right. So the way I'm using suffering, I think a lot of them use

56:18.160 --> 56:23.280
 suffering is the way you use like gravity. So in order for the roller coaster to work, you need

56:23.280 --> 56:28.320
 gravity. There needs to be a force that bring you down. Sure. And that same way, there's

56:29.600 --> 56:37.760
 like, you have to resist the natural pull of nature that wants to destroy you.

56:37.760 --> 56:46.240
 No, nature wants you to, nature's indifferent, but we have the capacity because we're blessed

56:46.240 --> 56:51.600
 with minds and we're blessed with friends. Yeah. To transcend nature. Yeah. No, I know,

56:51.600 --> 57:00.080
 but I think it's a word that captures something about life that there's no reason to it,

57:00.080 --> 57:04.880
 that is absurd. I think to me, oftentimes the way I think about the word suffering is

57:04.880 --> 57:13.680
 synonymous with absurdity. This is not suffering, but this is absurd. I just noticed there's a box

57:14.320 --> 57:19.920
 with a big bow on it next to you. What's in the box, Michael? It's your present. So it's your

57:19.920 --> 57:27.040
 present for New Year's. Can we open it? Yeah, sure. What's in the box? It's going to take,

57:27.040 --> 57:32.480
 and you brought up suffering. This is going to be very unpleasant. I packed it myself.

57:32.480 --> 57:38.480
 Yeah, there's a whole process in there. So there's three presents in there.

57:40.880 --> 57:44.000
 Lex, I'll read the card first. Okay.

57:49.200 --> 57:55.280
 Something about opening presents, like tearing stuff, makes me feel like, because like I just

57:55.280 --> 58:01.440
 tore this sheet of paper, so it'll never be the same again. It's entropy. It's entropy times,

58:01.440 --> 58:07.680
 times. You've got a powerful voice. You've got a powerful voice.

58:10.400 --> 58:15.920
 To Lex, thank you. Maybe I should read the other card first. You've got a powerful voice.

58:15.920 --> 58:20.720
 Listening to what you have to say always puts me in a hopeful place. I feel like this is building

58:20.720 --> 58:25.920
 up to something. You show me how change can happen when you face the world with pride,

58:25.920 --> 58:32.000
 confidence, and a voice that can't be silenced. Keep speaking up. The world is listening. Yeah.

58:33.360 --> 58:37.600
 There's no cynicism in this card. No, this is about, this is New Year's. This is all about

58:37.600 --> 58:44.960
 hope and joy. To Lex, I'm seeing the binary. To Lex, thank you for setting the path for me to

58:44.960 --> 58:58.240
 move to Austin. Zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, one. Michael Mals. Yeah.

59:00.400 --> 59:07.040
 Putting tears to my eyes. Thank you, brother. My pleasure. Let's get to the present.

59:07.040 --> 59:17.920
 Okay. It's a, it's a PC box. This is very promising. It better not be sex toys. There's

59:17.920 --> 59:23.200
 nothing, this is all, there's nothing inappropriate at all. Why would it? Why would sex toys be

59:23.200 --> 59:26.640
 inappropriate? Because you're, because you're a version.

59:30.160 --> 59:31.520
 You got to bring a knife to a party.

59:31.520 --> 59:39.920
 How clever is it to put it in a PC box? Well, I had it. I just got a new PC.

59:41.280 --> 59:45.680
 Okay. There's also a can. Yep. Open the can first. Open the can.

59:45.680 --> 59:58.080
 Do you wrap this yourself? That scared the shit out of me.

1:00:05.200 --> 1:00:09.280
 Go get back in the can. That actually stayed in there. That's magic.

1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:17.280
 You just got to cut the string. No.

1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:23.440
 You're the most beautiful troll of all. I love you so much.

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:31.280
 This is awesome.

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:43.200
 Did I, did it not work? Pick it up. Oh, it didn't work.

1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:52.960
 There's a terrifying springy feeling to this thing. I don't want to open this.

1:00:52.960 --> 1:01:05.760
 I need to move some side. I hate you so much. What?

1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:21.680
 Oh, is it the other way? No, just pick it up.

1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:31.760
 I can't believe I fell for that. I hate you so much.

1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:37.840
 Wrenches are my favorite. I can't believe I fell for that. Okay.

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:43.360
 And there's box number three. It's like a matryoshka. I can't believe that worked. Yeah.

1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:49.920
 I wanted a box to open all these gears to fall out, but you can't get it. You can't get them.

1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:54.320
 Yeah. Does that really grind your, your grind your gears?

1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:00.320
 Why am I scared? Okay.

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:08.960
 There's another box.

1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:17.920
 This leads to my death. No, no, this isn't, this is, there's a story behind it.

1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:24.480
 Can't believe that worked. Oh God, that's so good. All right.

1:02:27.520 --> 1:02:30.240
 All right. No springs, no weapons, no wrenches.

1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:40.640
 Okay. So let me tell you the story behind that toy.

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:48.400
 Tonka robots that turn into vehicles. So when you, there were, when I was a kid,

1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:56.720
 you had transformers, but for us poor people, you had GoBots, right? So the GoBots,

1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:01.680
 there were four main characters for the good guys. It was leader one, small foot turbo and scooter.

1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:05.360
 And what was annoying is when you had the action figures,

1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:10.800
 you couldn't find the ones that were on the TV show. And I was a big GoBots fan as a kid.

1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:16.880
 And I went once to the Toys R Us in Caesars Bay in Brooklyn with my grandfather. My grandfather

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:21.280
 was always very lucky. Like just good things happen to him every so often. And I went there,

1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:26.800
 remember very vividly, they must have just unpacked, just loaded the shelves and how they had the

1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:30.000
 shelving, it would be like, like a grid, you know, you'd have like, it was like one, two, three,

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:37.600
 or five, five rows and like five by five. And I remember it was like two up and then you have

1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:41.600
 to do, you have to sit by the side and kind of sort through them. And with the GoBots,

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:45.280
 each package had a picture of the different figures. So the packaging wasn't uniform.

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:49.680
 And they just had scooter there. She was just sitting there. And I was like, holy crap. So

1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:57.120
 that feeling when you're a kid and you find that just sitting on the shelf is right there.

1:03:57.120 --> 1:04:01.600
 It's just, it was such this. Wait, is this that scooter? No, I have it though. But that one is

1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:06.240
 for you. I thought if you want to put it next to your other robots, open it up. I can open it up.

1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:11.600
 Yeah, yeah, it's for you. And that way it's that symbol of joy when you have when you're a kid,

1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:16.160
 when you find something you really want. I think it just is really like when people look at it,

1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:20.800
 they'll be like, don't be hopeless. I'll open this carefully later. No, do it.

1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:27.680
 There's no way to open it carefully. Kids don't open stuff carefully. You rip that crap open.

1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:32.080
 But then you break it and you cry. That's what happens when you're a kid. I never did that.

1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:36.560
 Okay. Me neither. I never cried, but never got presents either.

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.680
 That is so cool. All right, scooter.

1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:48.080
 You symbolize childlike discovery. Right?

1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:56.720
 The poor, the poor man's robot. The poor man's transformers.

1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:01.120
 I think there's instructions on the back how to transform her.

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:05.360
 To her? I only found out as an adult that it was supposed to be a girl. Yeah.

1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:14.240
 Wow. This changes everything. No, give me here. Let me show you. It looks better when she's

1:05:14.240 --> 1:05:22.080
 transformed. What? No, there's levels to that statement. Oh, how does it do like this? Let

1:05:22.080 --> 1:05:30.160
 me see if I remember how to do it. Because I have this as a kid. Arms out. The thing is,

1:05:30.160 --> 1:05:37.840
 these are easy to break, I remember. Is it like this? No. Oh, the front comes out.

1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:44.960
 Oh, let me see this. Oh, this comes up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's that the arms go.

1:05:45.520 --> 1:05:52.800
 I'm having visions of like baby Michael. I can't do it. Okay. I can't do it. I can't figure it out.

1:05:52.800 --> 1:06:00.960
 Wow, you're right. She looks so much better transformed. All right. I'm going to follow

1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:08.640
 the instructions in a bit and I'll leave this failed project of yours. Oh, there's a wheel out.

1:06:09.360 --> 1:06:16.000
 Look, I don't like this in between form. Well, this is how it's going to be. Okay.

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:23.200
 Okay. Because we're going to be accepting of the transformation that takes time. Okay. I got,

1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:34.080
 I saw this little thing when I was walking on Congress and it says resist. It's a bracelet.

1:06:34.080 --> 1:06:40.080
 I mean, think of you. The reason I got it is because there's two bracelets. So one said lucky

1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:46.720
 fuck and the other one said resist. Now I first saw resist and I'm like, and then I saw the lucky

1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:54.400
 fuck and I realized I'm a lucky fuck to find a relevant. It makes me think of you. This is very

1:06:54.400 --> 1:07:02.800
 nice. Resist the powerful. That's true. I saw this somewhere. The oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1:07:02.800 --> 1:07:12.480
 Yeah. This has to do with, in terms of resist, you often bring up the book Machiavellians by

1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:19.600
 James Burnham. And so I was looking through, I was reading different parts of it. It's a tricky

1:07:19.600 --> 1:07:27.360
 read. It's a little bit, but there is a ebook Kindle version now that I've been working through.

1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:32.000
 There's, I think there's an actual audio book too. Anyway. Yeah. I just bought some, the Machiavellians

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:38.080
 is James Burnham's analysis of four thinkers that he regards as the Machiavellians. It was

1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:47.040
 Gaitana Moscow, Vilfredo Pareto, George Sorrell, and I'm blanking on the Moscow Pareto Sorrell

1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:52.560
 and George Michel. And I just got Pareto's autograph in the mail this week.

1:07:52.560 --> 1:08:03.440
 So he talks about freedom and liberty. This interesting line that I'd like to get your

1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:08.240
 opinion on in terms of resist and in terms of liberty. There's no one force, it goes, quote,

1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:14.880
 there's no one force, no group and no class that is the preserver of liberty. Liberty is preserved

1:08:14.880 --> 1:08:22.080
 by those who are against the existing chief power. Oppositions which do not express genuine

1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:27.920
 social forces are as trivial in relation to entrenched power as the old court jesters.

1:08:28.880 --> 1:08:35.360
 So, I mean, the question here is, can liberty, are you comfortable with that definition

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:42.800
 or that view of liberty, of freedom, that at its highest ideal is expressed through the

1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:49.120
 resistance to the powerful as opposed to existing in its own? I think his point, broadly speaking,

1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:57.360
 which I agree with, is the only thing that can work to mitigate power is other power, that its

1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:08.560
 talk is cheap and persuasion has very limited efficacy. It's like if there's a burglar, right,

1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:12.320
 and one person will give you a speech about property rights and you shouldn't be in this

1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:18.000
 person's house and the other person has a gun, you know, it's clear which is going to be more

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:25.520
 persuasive. Yeah, but can't you just be free without the struggle, without this conflict?

1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:35.680
 What I'm uncomfortable with this view is how closely it links freedom and conflict. Like,

1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:41.680
 why does this world have to have conflict for you to be free? I mean, it's, in part of it,

1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:44.560
 it's just emphasis. Well, you weren't just saying suffering is what leads to joy?

1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:50.560
 See, and now you're in agreement. Thank you. I just did that just so you can come around

1:09:50.560 --> 1:10:04.480
 and agree. I win. Next topic. Wow, I'm playing 3D chess here. Okay. This is New Year's.

1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:12.400
 This is now December 31st. I think that's how it works, but in 1973. Okay. We recorded this

1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:18.880
 before you were born. Oh, no, years after you were born in the 60s. You look great for 60s,

1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:30.240
 early 60s or short. Okay. What five things, let's say, are moments in 2021? Are you grateful for

1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:37.040
 or people? Just, I don't know, things, moments, beautiful experiences,

1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:43.680
 profound essences of the year. Like, looking back, what are the cool things that it just…

1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:44.960
 Personally or socially?

1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:51.760
 Do you exist like in a platonic way socially? I mean, oh, in your personal life?

1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:58.880
 Yeah. Anything. You're both, you're now Michael Malis. You exist as a social entity

1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:03.840
 and a personal human being and all of it, the whole thing. Like, what stands out to you about

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:10.320
 2021? The fact that for the first time in my life other than college, I moved to a new city.

1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:14.800
 That was a very big one. And there's no part of me that regrets it or misses New York.

1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:22.160
 So that was a very big deal for me. What do you, about this move, about Austin itself,

1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:31.200
 but maybe the move itself, maybe just the act of moving, what's great about it to you?

1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:37.760
 The fact that I had forgotten what it's like to have a huge social network, which I had in New

1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:42.640
 York before people started falling away and then it really escalated as a result of

1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:48.960
 de Blasio and the COVID restrictions. So to have a big crew here is something that was very

1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:56.000
 validating. The thing that's also exciting about Austin is that Austin is not a particularly big

1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.560
 town. It's not a particularly great town. But everyone here, at least in the circles I travel

1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:05.680
 in, is kind of a refugee from their towns. So there is this sense of camaraderie. There is

1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:10.640
 this sense of we're building something together. Back in New York, when you meet someone, it would

1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:14.720
 be like, who is this person? Why am I talking to them? Like, are they a normie? Are they going to

1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:19.440
 be weird? And here there's very little of that. I think there's much more sense of trust with one

1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:24.160
 another when you meet new people. So that's something that's really exciting about. Like,

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:27.440
 I've been introducing all my friends to each other and everyone's been hitting it off like

1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:34.160
 gangbusters. It's really great. So I really enjoy that about Austin. I'm enjoying the weather, the

1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:40.000
 space. You're at Kerouac and you have his stuff. I have. On the road, I read. I read a biography of

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:46.720
 him. I don't know if it was on, I think it was on the road where he, he talked about that feeling

1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:53.520
 when you go into some place, you're leaving a place and you go somewhere else. And the place

1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:59.520
 you're leaving disappears behind you and all the people and all. Like, you just think about that

1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:07.200
 life and it's forever gone. And there's some inkling of that where you get to realize your

1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:13.360
 almost mortality because, okay, that's a chapter and there's not many more. And it was a beautiful

1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:18.960
 chapter, but now onto the next chapter. Is there a melancholy feeling there? No, it's the opposite.

1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:22.720
 I feel like I've been giving a new lease on life because I didn't realize to what extent there was

1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:28.320
 this subtext of hopelessness in New York. And also people who, in New York, you don't appreciate,

1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:32.480
 or you appreciate it consciously, but you can't escape it emotionally. How much the winters

1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:38.080
 get to you psychologically. It's tough. It gets dark so early, it gets cold, you can't walk around.

1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:40.960
 Like, that's the thing that's fun about, or what's fun about New York is that, you know,

1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:44.560
 when the weather's warm, you can walk for an hour and just enjoy the sunshine and there's

1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:49.920
 a lot to see and do. But in the winter, you don't have any of that. It's brutal. And here, it's just,

1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:54.800
 so that is something. There's no melancholy at all. Well, that's because there's,

1:13:56.240 --> 1:14:01.040
 can we say something beautiful about New York? Not the way it is now, but the way it...

1:14:01.040 --> 1:14:03.280
 I could go on for days about how great New York was.

1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:09.280
 What did you learn about human civilization and just life that was beautiful from New York?

1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:20.160
 I learned that there's a lot of really unique special people out there who are doing their

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:25.920
 little part to move the envelope and make the world a better place. And that when you have a

1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:33.600
 city where they're all there together at the same time, that really moves the world. And I'm

1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:41.040
 thinking of Paris in the 20s and Harlem in the 20s and New York in the 70s and LA in the late

1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:46.240
 60s and San Francisco especially in late 60s, things like this. They really punch above Detroit

1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:51.680
 certainly at its heyday. They punch above their weight and just really kind of Philadelphia in

1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:56.480
 1700s. Things really start happening and that ripples throughout the world.

1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:01.920
 You think Austin has a chance to be a Paris in some way?

1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:07.360
 Yes, because again, it wasn't all of Paris. It was the left bank of Paris and Gertrude Stein

1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:12.800
 and Hemingway and all of them in a little area. So when you read these history books, these scenes,

1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:18.800
 it's like 50 people in a 10 block radius. These aren't these huge Davos conventions.

1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:26.880
 Okay, so the move, the big move, what else? What else stands out to you? Again, both personally and

1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:34.000
 socially, like zooming in and zooming out. I did a book with the UFC fighter and I was making the

1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:39.680
 point that he was a nine time world champion that I would never be as good at my job as he was at

1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:46.240
 his. And then when I dropped Anarchist Handbook in May and it was the top nonfiction book on

1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:51.440
 Amazon for like most of the day, I was like, oh, I'm the top nonfiction writer in America

1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:56.720
 just for today. I was like, oh crap, okay. So I guess I was wrong. That was a major deal. I was

1:15:56.720 --> 1:16:02.880
 still shocked and delighted. By the way, congratulations. I'm truly happy for you, man.

1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:14.080
 I'm so proud. But it's also, I'm proud because these are people who had points of view and they

1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:19.520
 didn't have it easy and they fought for what they believed in. And insofar as I get to

1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:25.360
 rescue them to some extent from the dustbin of history and say these people really mattered

1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:32.800
 and they really are worth hearing, that I love. I love stuff like that. I was talking to a friend

1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:39.040
 of mine, Topher, like a year ago, because we're in a weird position with what kind of jobs we have.

1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:43.120
 So I'd be talking on my live streams about people like Candy Darling or Wallace Thurman.

1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:49.200
 Like these are not household names at all. And then I'd be like proud of myself that I'm the

1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:54.560
 one who brings them to some sort of more prominence. And then you want to tell yourself, well, get

1:16:54.560 --> 1:16:59.040
 over yourself who you think you are. But no one else is talking about these people or very few.

1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:04.640
 So to be able to kind of give them some kind of stature and platform that they deserve,

1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:10.240
 I think is, I love being able to do that. So you have a strong voice yourself and to

1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:17.760
 sort of join them in. It's like John Lennon, joining in with the Beatles is like a chorus,

1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:24.000
 of very different views on anarchism. It's celebrating the individuals, it's celebrating

1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:31.600
 the idea. And you are, I think will be remembered as a powerful philosophy yourself, but like you're

1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:38.080
 almost taking just the humility of being in a room with powerful minds together in one book.

1:17:38.080 --> 1:17:44.560
 It's cool. Yeah. And that these people mattered and they had a unique perspective. And as I said

1:17:44.560 --> 1:17:49.680
 in the introduction to the book, I remember I was in college and we were studying bioethics and there

1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:55.840
 was like a graph in the book. And one part says, antinomianism, which was the view that

1:17:55.840 --> 1:18:01.760
 at one side said legalism, right, the two extremes. Legalism is what is legal is defined by the

1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:06.080
 government or what is moral is defined by the government. And one said, antinomianism, which

1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:10.960
 is nothing stands above moral law. And then there was like, well, since no one believes in this,

1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:14.080
 the answer is something to the other side. It's like, well, why is it on the charge no one believes,

1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:19.120
 if it has a name, someone believes in it, you know, so, you know, anarchism is a word that's

1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:23.920
 bandied about and in a dismissive way. And it's like, you don't have to like me or agree with

1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:27.920
 what I'm saying, but you can't pretend that they weren't Tolstoy, you're going to tell me Tolstoy,

1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:31.200
 doesn't nobody's talking about completely. He's in there. He was an anarchist. So

1:18:32.720 --> 1:18:36.880
 it was, it was a big accomplishment. It was really cool to get a chance to

1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:43.040
 do the audio book. You did an incredible thing, which has got a bunch of really cool people

1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:48.800
 to read a lot of interesting varied people. Yeah. So what I did for the audio book, which I

1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:54.640
 don't like the idea that hard work is inherently good, because sometimes being lazy is actually

1:18:54.640 --> 1:18:59.680
 the right choice. So I'm like, wait a minute, why am I reading all 23 chapters when it's 23

1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:04.000
 different authors? Does it make sense? So I hit my roll at X and I had different people read

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:10.560
 different chapters to make it sound literally like you have the different voices in the book.

1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:13.600
 Thank you very much. You did my, because I was going to read my chapter. Wait a minute,

1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:16.400
 like all the other authors being read by somebody else. Let's have Lex read mine.

1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:25.600
 The one chapter I am most moved by is Lauren Chen. She's a podcast as well. She's expecting

1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:31.280
 now. So we wish nothing but the best for Lauren and Liam and the babby. There's a chapter there

1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:36.000
 by this guy named Charles Robert Plunkett called Dynamite. And he's advocating for

1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:41.120
 making bombs and killing people, killing, you know, the forces of capitalism.

1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:47.120
 And Emma Goldman, it was published in her essay while she was in lecture tour, and she was just

1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:51.680
 like, why is this in here? This is, this is just really going to make us look bad, so on and so

1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:57.600
 forth. And when you're dealing with any kind of, you know, HL Makin has that quote about

1:19:57.600 --> 1:20:03.440
 every rational man must at times be tempted to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag,

1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:09.600
 and begin slitting throats. So I wanted to talk, sound like the seductive

1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:13.920
 aspect of violence. Like that's the problem. Like when you're dealing with terrorism, when

1:20:13.920 --> 1:20:19.840
 you're dealing with political violence, to be able to understand how people can fall for this,

1:20:19.840 --> 1:20:25.600
 how people can be persuaded to think, this is a good idea that I'm going to make some dynamite

1:20:25.600 --> 1:20:30.080
 and throw it into this crowd and kill, you know, police officers and innocent people

1:20:30.080 --> 1:20:35.280
 possibly in the service of, you have to, it's easy to say all they're all crazy, but they're not,

1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:42.160
 you know, even not most people who are crazy don't do these things, you know. So to have a woman

1:20:42.160 --> 1:20:48.080
 read that chapter, and I told her kind of read it like a phone sex operator, because I wanted to

1:20:48.080 --> 1:20:54.160
 have that siren song of like, so you can understand why this calls out to people who are in the rope,

1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:58.800
 the people who are like marginalized. And she did such a superb job with that chapter.

1:21:00.320 --> 1:21:05.680
 That's such a beautiful vision. Yeah, because violence, that's violence is part of human history

1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:14.720
 to a degree that it must be seductive. It must be, there must be a strong pull. Like it's not

1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:21.920
 insane people. There's something probably deep within our nature that craves violence.

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:30.240
 And then when there is charismatic leaders that inspire that, and revolution plus violence,

1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:35.440
 that, I could see that being extremely seductive to us. Like when you're truly suffering in your

1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:39.280
 current situation, whatever it is, you're being oppressed by governments or being oppressed by

1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:47.440
 the powerful, violent revolution is probably there's something deep within us that longs for that.

1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:52.320
 And also this kind of the Jelaine Maxwell to Jeffrey Epstein, right? You need that woman to

1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:57.520
 be like, no, no, this is okay, honey, come along. It's not a big deal. Don't listen to what your

1:21:57.520 --> 1:22:04.000
 parents told you. They're just prudes. It's a siren song. What do you think about Jelaine Maxwell,

1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:13.680
 the trial and so on? Again, maybe the interesting story there is about the coverage of the trial.

1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:18.960
 So like the story is more complex and interesting than the actual horrific acts themselves.

1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:27.920
 So to me, I don't, maybe I'm not knowledgeable enough, but to me, she's also truly evil. I don't

1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:36.640
 know where to, maybe you can help me to figure out who is more evil. The, just like you said now,

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:43.600
 the person says it's okay. It's okay. That helps the evil doer or is it the evil doer themselves?

1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:47.920
 I don't know, but I think she's a, she scares me more than Jeffrey Epstein somehow.

1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:52.480
 There's people like that in the world too. I had like a Twitter poll. Do you think it's more

1:22:52.480 --> 1:23:00.080
 evil or less evil to kill someone because you've been paid to do it? And people, the winning answer

1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:06.960
 was more evil. And I said it was less because I think in that case, you can kind of check out,

1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:12.480
 you could be like, this isn't my, I'm just doing a job. I don't, you know, you kind of can, I think

1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:18.160
 in a sense, if you have a certain mindset, like intellect to remove yourself from the situation,

1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:23.840
 I'm just a conduit. When you were talking, I haven't been following her case that, that much.

1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:30.640
 That's cause you mostly watch CNN and CNN is not covering it. Well, I think my broader point would

1:23:30.640 --> 1:23:40.320
 be people who are untouchable and who know they're untouchable do much worse things than those of us

1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:47.840
 who aren't that way can appreciate. Like I'm, I was just talking about on Twitter about Rosemary

1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:55.520
 Kennedy. She was one of JFK's sisters. It's not clear whether she was developmentally disabled or

1:23:55.520 --> 1:24:01.120
 had like depressive mental illness. There was something clearly off with her to some capacity.

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:08.720
 And at age 23, they gave her a lobotomy. And the thing with a lobotomy is you have to be

1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:12.320
 conscious. You don't, they don't put you under her. So you have to be counting backwards while

1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:18.800
 their scalp was in your brain and they stopped, but they stopped, they did too far. She became

1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:22.240
 mentally like a two year old, you know, never had bladder control for the rest of her life,

1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:29.280
 couldn't really talk or walk. And when that happened, they just put her away to some home

1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:33.200
 and they never mentioned her again, or they didn't tell the brothers or sisters where she went.

1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:39.200
 The lobotomy was only revealed in 1987. And they pretended, Oh, she's a, you know,

1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:46.000
 in this home for kids with special needs. And it's just like, like that to me is very,

1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:51.520
 very scary that someone could, you know, do this to their people. I saw people respond,

1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:55.920
 they go, that was, you know, cutting edge technology at the time, haha. But I'm like,

1:24:55.920 --> 1:25:01.840
 I don't think that that was really done that, that frequently or be hearing more about it,

1:25:01.840 --> 1:25:04.960
 all these, you know, botched lobotomies. And my understanding is lobotomies are

1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:11.280
 very hard to, like you, they would want to do something like a mass murder or like,

1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:14.960
 like if someone's really bad, like if the person's left an invalid, like who cares kind

1:25:14.960 --> 1:25:20.000
 of situation, but you're dealing with something like this, like she's not killing people. She's

1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:25.280
 not assaulting people. She's just difficult because she's making your, your vaunted family look bad.

1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:30.720
 So, um, so that's to you, that's, what is it? Like psychopathy or something like that? Like,

1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:34.880
 you don't care about, you just, you, you do horrific things and you don't really care.

1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:42.160
 I can't diagnose Joe Kennedy, but what I would say, like, of a Jolaine Maxwell, I can't empathize

1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:46.880
 because I don't understand, first of all, even in a positive sense, I don't know what it's like to be

1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:52.160
 grooming my son to be the president and lost, you know, the other son in war. I don't know what

1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:56.240
 that's like. Uh, I don't know what it's like to be so wealthy. Like I have, you have to go

1:25:56.240 --> 1:26:01.360
 get Joe Kennedy credit because a lot of what he was fighting for was to allow, you know, Irish people

1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:06.640
 and Catholic people acceptance into like high society. And he was up against a lot of pressure

1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:10.240
 with that. And he's like, I'm going to, you know, screw these people. I'm going to be recognized

1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:13.760
 and we're going to make, make people recognize. So there's something to be said for that. But

1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:23.280
 I mean, I, I can't relate to people like him. Yeah. But I mean, that like is just terrifying.

1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:28.240
 Like the, I mean, one of the big reasons I'm an anarchist is like when you have someone who has

1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:33.360
 that sense of amount of power over somebody else, a lot of times they're going to do bad things

1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:39.840
 and have no consequences. Do you think, uh, in a Jolaine Maxwell case and Epstein case,

1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:46.960
 do you think they were trying to blackmail people like trying the, what the conspiracy

1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:54.720
 theories kind of describe, that's probably not too far away from reality. Did they intentionally

1:26:54.720 --> 1:27:02.160
 try to put powerful people in compromising situations so that they can basically get more

1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:07.040
 and more power? Yeah. I think that was a Vanity Fair piece that you're referring to or fortune.

1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:10.720
 Oh, sorry. I'm just referring to a general concept. Oh, there was, so there was an article

1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:14.240
 that broke this down because this article is either fortune business week, Vanity Fair,

1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:19.440
 I don't remember, a major, major reputable outlet. And they were, they made the reporter,

1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:23.760
 made the point, they asked around and they go, this guy's a billionaire or extremely wealthy at

1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:28.400
 least. No one I know ever traded with him. Like, where's his money coming from? There's no, there's

1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:34.560
 no paper trail. So they're like, okay, if it's not trading and trades are public often, you know,

1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:40.080
 where's this money coming from? And it's also like, why are all these people allowing Epstein to be

1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:45.040
 their business manager when he has no kind of track record to show for it? So the hypothesis was

1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:51.920
 he would get people into uncompromising situations with underage girls, secretly film it, and then

1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:55.840
 he would, you know, blackmail them accordingly. Well, I guess that's the question. That would make

1:27:55.840 --> 1:28:01.440
 sense. I know it makes sense, but I also see a lot of evidence that he's just very charismatic in a

1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:09.120
 room. So, and I've also seen, you know, that's how human connections get made, like business deals

1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:16.640
 get made. Yeah, but how, where's his money coming from? Oh, like they rich people without blackmailing,

1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:23.920
 just like him close, like him as a friend. I'm not arguing that. Like, okay, I like Jeff Epstein.

1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:28.400
 Make sure you pull that quote. Yes. I'm a business person. I like Jeff Epstein. Michael Malis. I

1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:35.200
 love Jeff. Like or love? Love. I'm in love with. This escalated quickly. I'm gonna hand over him

1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:41.600
 to be my money manager to have 20% of my estate fine. Yeah. Where is he making the money for

1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:46.400
 that 20%? That's the thing that there's no paper trail, have him trading or anything. So I can

1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:54.400
 understand. Oh, I see. Yeah. Interesting. What were your 2020 favorite moments? You mean 2021?

1:28:54.400 --> 1:29:01.600
 Yeah, 2021. Yeah, yeah. Clearly, it's just laying Maxwell trial. It just really stands out to me.

1:29:01.600 --> 1:29:08.640
 It's very moving, which is why I bring it up. No. Moving here. So moving here. But for me,

1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:13.680
 I think we actually didn't cover that with you. And I'd love to get your comment.

1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:20.080
 Because you said it's the first time in your life you moved. So it's not just about the place you

1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:28.320
 go to. It's the actual act of moving is also a leap. Oh, yeah. The decision was that I'm going to

1:29:28.320 --> 1:29:36.240
 give away my salary at MIT. So stop taking salary, give away the group. So students,

1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:41.440
 normal research, the grant funding, and still keep an MIT affiliation just because our friends

1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:46.000
 and colleagues, they're still doing research, but giving away really primarily is the source

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:54.000
 of money. So no salary. And let it go to zero. Let my bank account go to zero. And take a leap

1:29:54.000 --> 1:30:02.880
 in San Francisco or elsewhere. And as COVID broke out, and a lot of people started talking to me

1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:07.920
 about San Francisco, about the cynicism there, and I'll go there. And there was a kind of,

1:30:09.280 --> 1:30:15.120
 so it's not all the woke stuff and all that kind of things, which is also a problem. It's less

1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:21.440
 about dreaming about a big future, about building a big future, and more about some kind of identity

1:30:21.440 --> 1:30:27.760
 politic battles that they're just, you could say some some aspect in the positive light is important,

1:30:27.760 --> 1:30:34.400
 but in a place like Silicon Valley, to me, the most important thing is to do big things. And

1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:41.760
 for that to be most of the conversation. And so that cynicism was there. And then I went to

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:47.120
 look at Austin and Austin was the opposite. Yeah, it's the optimism. And you have people like

1:30:47.120 --> 1:30:53.680
 as I talked to, as Elon was the optimistic about making this the capital of artificial

1:30:53.680 --> 1:31:01.520
 intelligence and technology and so on. And Mr. Joe Rogan, now just the optimism about

1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:06.560
 making this the cultural capital of the world of, I mean, specifically comedy, but like,

1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:12.480
 it just radiates from them, just the excitement. And I've seen not many people of that nature in

1:31:12.480 --> 1:31:17.600
 my life. And when I see that in their eyes, that engine, that fire of wanting to create something

1:31:17.600 --> 1:31:22.400
 special about the place. First of all, those people rarely fail. That's first of all. And

1:31:22.400 --> 1:31:27.520
 second of all, that's contagious. It's contagious. It's very contagious. And so all that combined,

1:31:28.080 --> 1:31:34.160
 for me, 2021 was the the actual leap of taking the leap saying, all right, well,

1:31:35.600 --> 1:31:40.320
 I'm actually going to do this. So not just giving away the salary, not giving away all

1:31:40.320 --> 1:31:46.160
 that, but the whole thing. That's it. You just move to a place. There's an empty building.

1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:54.720
 And you're moving into it. And this is a new life. And that leap, I don't know,

1:31:54.720 --> 1:32:00.560
 it's a scary leap to take. Because I've taken that leap many times in my life. And this is where

1:32:00.560 --> 1:32:07.360
 parents and all those kinds of cynicism is really destructive. Because from a cynical

1:32:07.360 --> 1:32:12.960
 perspective is, you know, I worked at Google. So why leave Google? There's a very high paying

1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:20.560
 salary that you can have Google. Then MIT, why leave MIT? Like, it's MIT. This is you've always

1:32:20.560 --> 1:32:25.680
 dreamed about, like, why do you get a PhD? Yeah, you've loved MIT. You're like, why leave MIT?

1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:29.760
 I mean, this is the same process I've gone through with a lot of things in life. Like,

1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:35.920
 you've been saying every single stage and you need that. You need friends, you need support groups

1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:39.760
 and all those kinds of things that are extremely important. But in the end, it's about taking the

1:32:39.760 --> 1:32:46.640
 leap. And for me, 2021 was this leap. And to me, that one of the most beautiful things you can do

1:32:46.640 --> 1:32:52.000
 in life is to take those leaps. And that's something that I think is no longer a thing in New York.

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:57.840
 There's no sense of hope. You don't go to New York now. If there's been such an assault and

1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:02.480
 intentionally or otherwise, maybe it's inevitable, they didn't have a choice.

1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:07.760
 But there's been such an assault and creativity and small business in New York that no one,

1:33:07.760 --> 1:33:12.000
 very few people who are in New York right now think things are going to get great soon. Whereas

1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:17.920
 here, I feel it's every day is just something exciting is going to happen. And that's part

1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:23.360
 of the culture and how the conversation goes. It's just invoked to be cynical in New York and

1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:29.280
 San Francisco. I hope it changes because what I love about New York and what I love about Austin

1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:38.240
 also is the weirdos, the characters, just the variety of personalities that if you just walk

1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:42.560
 around, you get to meet them. And I think New York still has that, but it has the extra cynicism

1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:49.120
 on top of it. That's a negative. I mean, just becoming friends with Joe, he inspired me to be

1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:57.760
 nicer to people, to not take myself seriously, to be humble, to celebrate friends, not to be

1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:04.240
 competitive. All those things, since I started listening to his podcast from the very beginning,

1:34:04.240 --> 1:34:10.160
 it just radiated from the guy. The thing that people don't appreciate is Joe Rogan

1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:16.640
 likes it when you bust his chops. Yeah. I mean, a lot of people at that level,

1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:20.320
 like if it's, oh, Mr. Rogan, you're laughing at everything they say, they don't want that. It's

1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:24.400
 very phony and they feel uncomfortable because they know that everything they say is hilarious.

1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:31.600
 I remember I went with him, he was doing a performance here and I was, yeah, you were there

1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:37.200
 and he was doing his set. And I'd reached the point now where I don't think of him as Joe Rogan,

1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:40.880
 you know, just like my buddy's doing standup, you forget. And then I looked at the audience

1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:44.400
 and I remember him like, oh, this is like a religious experience for these people,

1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:49.040
 but you forget who he is because he doesn't carry himself like a big shot.

1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:54.160
 Yeah. And still, I mean, he gets competitive as fuck. Like I argue with him a lot. I mean,

1:34:55.040 --> 1:34:59.440
 when I talked to Francis Collins and Pfizer CEO, you better believe I heard from Joe.

1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:05.280
 And then we would just get super drunk and argue about it. So it's, I mean,

1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:11.280
 it's beautiful and he gets really passionate. So it's not like, it's not like easy to argue with

1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:16.640
 him, but that's great when you don't take it personally. It's fun.

1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:20.720
 As you and I discussed, and I'm sure he wouldn't mind us saying this, but like

1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:26.080
 that moment when you first get a text from Joe Rogan and it's a boomer meme,

1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:29.280
 like I finally felt like I've arrived as a person.

1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:32.000
 A boomer meme? What kind of boomer meme are we talking about?

1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.960
 Like he's just some silly meme, but it's just like, this is the kind of thing you can imagine

1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:38.320
 someone's uncle posting on Facebook. It's Joe Rogan texting it to you.

1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:44.160
 Yeah. I mean, for me also with Elon, obviously, there's a few people, I'm just saying folks that

1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:50.480
 people know. Also Jim Keller, who's worked with Elon. So I've had conversations with them

1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:56.080
 because it's just my line of work. They're realizing that everything is possible in this world.

1:35:56.080 --> 1:35:59.680
 Yeah. Yeah. Which is not the Russian mindset. Yeah.

1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:06.320
 Well, okay. All right. That's, let's style it down a notch.

1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:11.760
 Yeah. It's what, when Elon calls first principles thinking, but really it's just

1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:15.040
 not being limited by the constraints of the past. Yes.

1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:20.320
 And so saying like, okay, this is how things have been done, but can be done much, much better.

1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:27.200
 And that has to do with manufacture. Like how do we do this 10 times cheaper?

1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:33.680
 Like everyone says it's super expensive, but does it really need to be, this is more of a question

1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:37.520
 about manufacture, about how to take, build a product, how to actually have a product that's

1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:43.840
 scaled it as an impact than just having a very serious engineering, like to the level of physics,

1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:51.440
 discussion about building a thing and fucking doing it and just being around people that did it.

1:36:52.000 --> 1:37:00.160
 And, you know, basically, literally or figuratively said, fuck you to everybody in the room that said

1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:06.080
 they can't do it. And that, that energy. So that I've gotten to know Elon a lot better in 2021.

1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:11.520
 That to me, it's like everything, the whole thing, that moving here and being surrounded

1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:18.960
 by the optimistic energy and then the individual interactions with people that refuse to be like

1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:24.560
 brought down by the, yeah, the cynicism of the world, the naysayers. It's,

1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:31.840
 that to me is what I'm going to remember this year for. And I hope it like materializes into

1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:36.240
 something concrete here in Austin and I feel is, is doing that.

1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:40.880
 I really am curious to be a fly on the wall. I'm sure it'll happen at some point,

1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:46.080
 watching you and Elon talk to each other. He's even more of a robot than you. He was on the

1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:50.640
 Babylon B podcast and I was honored to be able to be in the room while this was happening.

1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:57.680
 And with the guys at the B do at the end of every podcast, they have like, like 10 questions.

1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:02.400
 I don't think this is one of those. No, no, this one. And they go to Elon. Would you,

1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:06.640
 would you rather be Batman or Iron Man? You know, because they're both like multi million

1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:12.160
 industrialists and Elon being Elon is like, well, let's think this through. There's different

1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:16.480
 kinds of bats. You've got, you know, fruit bats and you got insect bats. Why is it called Batman?

1:38:16.480 --> 1:38:20.880
 Batman should fly, right? That's gonna fly. And I'm just sitting there with a holy dude,

1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:25.760
 just answer the question. It was so literal. I was like, damn.

1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:32.880
 I guess by this point, release of the podcast with him. That's a several hours. And it's exactly

1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:39.040
 as you would imagine. It's exactly as you would imagine. There was this super technical movie

1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:45.120
 her. Yes. So there's that one scene. It's when, what is it walking feet? Who's the lead character?

1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:48.560
 Yeah. A walking fetus. Yeah. So he's the lead and he falls in love with Siri,

1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:54.080
 basically, who's played by Scarlett Johansson. And there's another artificial AI that she's talking

1:38:54.080 --> 1:39:00.080
 to. And she's like, oh, can I permission to go into nonverbal communication with this professor

1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:04.880
 and the guys like, sure. And they just start talking to each other in their robot. And I'm

1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:10.480
 just imagining the two of you having this mind meld. Well, that, so there's both the humor of that,

1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:16.560
 but also the practical nature of the kind of conversations to have. It's so great because

1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:22.560
 it's a, it's problem solving mode. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's so fun. That is exciting.

1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:28.000
 Because like you stop completing sentences. I actually feel at home because you don't need

1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:34.000
 to say the full sentences anymore. You could just like say random words and you start to understand

1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:38.640
 what you're talking about. And then you can have multiple conversations at the same time and go

1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:44.320
 on these tangents. One of the biggest problems I have with podcasting for me talking, I have to

1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:49.760
 finish my sentences. I have to actually finish making a point, which is a big problem because

1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:54.320
 there's like a listener that needs to hear the point being finished as opposed to completing

1:39:54.960 --> 1:40:03.120
 your sentences inside your own mind. And like the thing I find is useful to Yon does the exact

1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:10.960
 same thing is when the line of thinking is no longer useful, you just ran, you just switched

1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:14.880
 to the next thing. You just leave that whole thing behind. You don't need a nice transition.

1:40:14.880 --> 1:40:20.800
 You don't need any of that. And also just, it's the first principles thing. It's like zooming in

1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:28.880
 on the elephant in the room. I love that. It's so energizing. That's what I love about engineers.

1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:36.240
 It's not the, it's not the maybe most eloquent communication style, but I love it. What about

1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:45.360
 you? So you said moving. The book. The book. What else? And you've been really excited about,

1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:52.240
 so that's Anarchist Handbook, but you've also been nonstop excited about white film. That was

1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:56.960
 most of this year. You've been actually made significant progress. Yeah. I'm on page 40 of

1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:01.600
 the second draft and it's really kind of funny because when you're doing your, I think 10th book,

1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:07.520
 I lost track already. The first draft is actually pretty good. Like I'm going back and like,

1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:10.080
 all right, this is going to be a whole slog. I'm like, oh, I just have to cut and paste this and

1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:17.760
 basically tweak a few words. So I did a good job with the first draft. It's also funny when you're

1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:28.240
 writing how, and I guess this is the mark of a good professional writer. My personal feelings

1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:36.160
 don't match how the characters in the book come off. Like I have a lot of fondness for people

1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:41.120
 like Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman and they're early on in the book, but they're not good

1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:45.680
 people. And I'm writing it objectively and whatever. And I'm reading this, I'm like,

1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:53.760
 they come off much worse than my personal appraisal of them. So it's kind of interesting as a writer

1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:58.400
 when you're watching it. I guess kind of like an attorney, right? Like you can have a situation

1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:03.520
 where you, as an attorney, you have a lot of fondness for your client, but you realize that

1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:09.040
 they probably did this thing or it could be other way. Like they're innocent, but it's hard for you

1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:12.720
 to make a good case for them because the data is not there. Can you actually talk about your

1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:17.520
 writing process in several ways? Sure. One, your writing process, but two, by way of advice of

1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:24.080
 how to write, you've talked about in the past, like your first draft is these kind of disparate

1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:28.000
 or more chaotic and that you don't, in the same way that maybe I was saying in the engineering

1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:31.760
 discussion, you don't complete the sentences. It's just like thoughts. Yes. So the first

1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:38.880
 like real good writing advice I remember getting was this book by Peggy Noonan called

1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:43.840
 What I Saw at the Revolution. And she was Ron Reagan's speech writer. She still writes for

1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:49.520
 The Wall Street Journal. The book I bought was at a used bookstore in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania,

1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:55.920
 when I was in college. The spine is cocked. I still have it. It was 99 cents. And she talked,

1:42:55.920 --> 1:43:00.000
 you know, when you're writing for a president, this is no joke, especially for a president who

1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:05.440
 says no, the great communicator, Reagan, you know, so, and you have to be very inspirational,

1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:10.080
 but also not come off as corny, which is very hard to do. And she in the book talks about

1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:15.280
 how she wrote speeches for him, how she, you know, I'm paraphrasing her and I haven't read

1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:20.560
 her book in a couple of decades, but basically she would write like a brain dump and it's just

1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:25.120
 garbage. And she was like, that's okay, just get it all out there. And then, you know,

1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:30.000
 there's that expression all writing is editing. So for the white pill specifically, this is,

1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:34.160
 I don't know if it's the most ambitious book I've ever done. Your reader, I think is more

1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:37.440
 ambitious because that's all of North Korea's history. And it's written somebody else's voice,

1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:42.160
 not person's emotion. And you, like you mentioned, you had to read a giant number.

1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:47.520
 Yes, 60 bucks as research. Yeah. Well, maybe can we just pause? Can you say what white pill is about?

1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:53.120
 Sure, it's a tale. It's about hope. And it's a tale of good and evil. And I think that's,

1:43:53.120 --> 1:43:58.160
 I don't want to tip my hand too much. But people always like, how do you think, why are you so

1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:03.040
 hopeful? And I'm not hopeful on an emotional level. I'm hopeful because looking at history,

1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:09.120
 I think there's certain things that not will certainly happen again. But it's not at all

1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:14.000
 implausible to happen again. And that the good guys will win. And this is one of those cases.

1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:20.880
 So, you know, I had the book took on a life of its own. It's very different from how originally

1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:25.520
 conceived it. I originally conceived it as a kind of retelling of Camus philosophy.

1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:30.480
 Ryan Holliday, who he used to be close friends with, I've talked to him a while,

1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:34.320
 he has a whole kind of cottage industry based on the Stoics of the past. I'm like, okay,

1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:40.160
 can I ask him once? Can I do this with Camus? He said, sure. And then I reread Camus recently,

1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:45.760
 and it wasn't what I had remembered. I was like, can we pause on that? I apologize to interrupt.

1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:51.680
 So, it's interesting. So, he kind of took ideas from Stoics and started to kind of

1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:58.400
 use it as a book that gives you advice about how to live life from the Stoic perspectives.

1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:05.360
 And you were thinking, is there something in existentialism, absurdism, or something specifically

1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:11.440
 in Camus thinking, or I think you've mentioned the myth of Sisyphus specifically, like his

1:45:11.440 --> 1:45:17.040
 philosophical work. So, you were trying to see like, is there, can I resurrect this? That's actually,

1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:24.880
 I would think that's an interesting project. And it's sad to hear that

1:45:24.880 --> 1:45:33.280
 it was, it didn't materialize in exactly that form, because I thought there would be a lot

1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:37.040
 in that. So, I had Douglas Murray on my show, and he also made the point, like, when you go back

1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:42.560
 and read Camus, there's not that much there. The myth of Sisyphus is not at all how I remembered

1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:48.000
 it. The vast bulk of that book is like literary criticism. So, he's talking about Dusty F's,

1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:51.440
 you know, those different people who are in bottoms of the absurd, but I'm like, this isn't,

1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:55.600
 there's not much to take from here. The actual title essay is basically like a

1:45:56.320 --> 1:46:03.040
 sixth chapter essay at the back of the book, which, you know, it's good for what it is, but

1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:08.800
 there's not that much there to draw. I'm extremely, he's a great hero of mine. I think his life is

1:46:08.800 --> 1:46:15.120
 just enormously admirable. He fought very hard against the Nazi occupation. His book, The Plague,

1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:20.560
 which I find unreadable, is an allegory about, you know, Germany conquering France and so on and so

1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:25.680
 forth. Wait a minute. Why is The Plague unreadable? It's the kind of book where reading the book

1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:32.320
 doesn't add anything to the plot. The plot is a plague comes, sleeps over the town, destroys a lot

1:46:32.320 --> 1:46:35.840
 of life, and vanishes as quickly as it came. You don't need to read the book now. Like, you get the

1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:42.000
 point. I deeply disagree with you. Yes, of course I've read The Plague. To me, I mean, The Plague is

1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:51.040
 about the doctor, and it's about love, and it's about the different roles that humans take in time

1:46:51.040 --> 1:46:57.280
 and tragedy, like The Plague. Also, it's an allegory, so you can start to think about, like,

1:46:57.280 --> 1:47:00.720
 what, you know, you could, whether it's Nazi Germany, whatever you think that is. Yeah.

1:47:01.920 --> 1:47:07.840
 To me, though, that was about love and about, like, the role, like, the highest ideal being the doctor,

1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:13.600
 like, sacrifices themselves for others, and, like, still has love and hope. I mean, to me,

1:47:14.480 --> 1:47:21.440
 the way that story is told, I think, has a lot of meaning. It's like, to me, you're saying that's

1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:27.680
 interesting. You say it this way. To me, it's like saying Animal Farm doesn't need to be read,

1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:34.800
 because it's an obvious story. I don't think there's much plot to The Plague. I think Animal

1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:43.200
 Farm has a very long plot and a complex plot. But there's experiences within. So the situation set

1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:50.320
 up in The Plague, and there's experiences that start to reveal a philosophy. So, yeah, it's not

1:47:50.320 --> 1:47:58.160
 very plot driven. Yeah. But, so I would say you still should read it, but the plot doesn't,

1:47:58.160 --> 1:48:04.720
 like, you didn't give away anything currently. Right. That's, so some books are just, I mean,

1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:10.720
 Ayn Rand is similar to that, in a sense. Like, the plot is not as important as the behavior of

1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:16.720
 the different people in that plot. I think she's very plot heavy. No, she has plots, but I'm saying

1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:21.920
 that's not necessarily the important thing. To me, the behavior of the people is the important thing.

1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:26.320
 Sure, but you could, you could, you could, like, separate it into a bunch of blog posts,

1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:33.120
 and they stand on their own. I would have to think about that with Ayn Rand. She, she does

1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:38.080
 through the plot create a world where you start to understand the different values that people have.

1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:46.960
 But, yeah. But that's what the plot serves. Yeah, I would have to think. But in The Plague,

1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:51.680
 it's the behavior of the people that's really important. And the same, I mean, the stranger,

1:48:51.680 --> 1:48:58.400
 too. I mean, these like, I'm sure I'm trying to scramble here for books. I really appreciate

1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:05.760
 that. Don't have a plot. I mean, no, no, it's from underground. So obviously, this task

1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:12.160
 is a huge amount of plot in most of his work. Herman Hess has a huge amount of plot. Thomas

1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:15.840
 Mann doesn't have the plot. He's the one who doesn't have plots. Thomas Mann, would you say

1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:21.680
 Kafka has a plot? I think Kafka is very heavy plot driven. Yeah. But I just don't see that, I guess.

1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:27.360
 I guess Metamorphosis doesn't really have a plot. Yeah, but there's like crawling around.

1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:34.080
 But it's like a vignette. It's not really like this. Yeah. A hunger artist on my probably favorite

1:49:34.080 --> 1:49:38.880
 short stories. That kind of short story is a pretty long short story of Kafka's is really

1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:45.440
 interesting. It's about a man. I don't know if you read it. No, I think so. It's about a man that

1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:53.840
 is like a freak in the sense that his skill is that he can fast for a long time. Okay. And then

1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:58.480
 people gather on the cage and look at him as he, as he fasts. I don't actually remember if

1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:04.880
 he's in the cage or not, but the, and eventually he fasts so long that people don't even care anymore.

1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:12.880
 Like they just leave. So there's a, there's a, it has to do something. It makes me think about like

1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:22.080
 don't become the way you live. Don't become like a freak show, a circus act. Like live for

1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:28.160
 an ideal, live, live for something that brings you joy. Or don't live for the sake of attention.

1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:34.480
 For the sake of attention. That's a good point. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so I rudely interrupt you

1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:39.120
 because you were talking about the plague and connecting it to the writing process of white pill.

1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:45.920
 Yeah. Well, anyway, so, you know, how I was writing this one, I just had a first draft of

1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:50.960
 notes and they're all, it's not in chronological order. It's like, I read certain books as research

1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:56.560
 and then I had the pull quotes that was necessary there. And now I'm basically rearranging everything

1:50:56.560 --> 1:51:03.120
 and putting it. So the book started as Ryan Holliday's, right. Equal Ryan Holliday as Camus.

1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:08.640
 The working title would have been The Point of Tears because this is quick. Camus is a great

1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:13.360
 quote maker and he has this line about man must live, live to the point of tears,

1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:21.760
 which I think is just what I love about him is Camus, he comes off as like he's clenching his

1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:28.720
 teeth. He's clenching his teeth both in terms of like barely mitigated rage and injustice.

1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:34.160
 Like when he sees people suffering, it just really makes him like just upset to the core.

1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:43.040
 But also this sense of not taking life for granted and kind of just pushing yourself

1:51:43.040 --> 1:51:48.000
 and pushing the boundaries and his point being that life is inherently meaningless,

1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:53.200
 which gives a great opportunity to impute meaning to it, to create our own meaning to life.

1:51:53.200 --> 1:52:00.720
 So taking the main essay from Mythocisophus, that was the origin story for the white pill,

1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:06.160
 but then it became something completely different. And so then it became, how are you so optimistic

1:52:06.160 --> 1:52:10.080
 in the face of everything that's going on in the world? And I started writing it when COVID started

1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:17.840
 hitting. And because again, I'm not optimistic because of some temperament of mine. I'm optimistic

1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:24.560
 because people talk about how if the US didn't exist, China would just become an empire and take

1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:31.680
 over everything. Empires are expensive. And they look at the British Empire, look at the

1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:40.880
 Soviet Union. It's not automatically sustainable. It costs a lot of things to make sure when you're

1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:47.360
 geographically all over the world literally to keep everyone in line. It's not at all like a

1:52:47.360 --> 1:52:53.920
 supervillain in a movie. Once it happens, it's the happy ending for them. So yeah, that was the

1:52:53.920 --> 1:53:00.400
 start. And I'm like, all right, let me tell one thing I'm good at is telling stories. So this is

1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:07.520
 really a... So this is plot driven. Very, very plot driven and also heavily character driven,

1:53:07.520 --> 1:53:15.120
 but the characters are real. Yeah, got it. So it's interesting to kind of mention what kind of,

1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:20.400
 what does the first draft kind of look like in terms of what kind of things do you plop down?

1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:25.600
 Oh, so it'll be like, let's suppose I just read some book called The Guillotine at Work, which was

1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:30.800
 an early book attacking Lenin from the anarcho communist perspective. So it'll just be like

1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:34.960
 all the different quotes, like a paragraph here, double space, another paragraph, blah, blah,

1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:41.280
 so on and so forth. Whereas for other sections where I wasn't just using a book as research,

1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:46.160
 there would be like talking about McKinley getting shot. Like it's just me writing the narrative

1:53:46.160 --> 1:53:51.360
 and that I could just pretty much copy paste into the second draft. By way of advice, would

1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:57.600
 you give that as advice? Is that a good way to do it? Is that a very peculiar way your brain

1:53:57.600 --> 1:54:01.280
 works? No, so this is actually advice I feel comfortable giving to people who are trying to

1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:09.360
 write because it's just like with the gym, right? If you did seven sets, seven, excuse me, reps last

1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:13.600
 week and you did eight this week, it's psychologically motivating because you're going in the right

1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:19.920
 direction and do you mind extrapolates? So make sure, tell yourself, I'm going to get a page done

1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:24.400
 today or two pages done. So you're asked to run the computer and I'll have to get up to get those

1:54:24.400 --> 1:54:30.240
 two pages. It doesn't matter if they look at garbage because if you have a 300 page first draft

1:54:30.800 --> 1:54:36.480
 and it's crap, at least you have something to work with and that's a big number. So if you're

1:54:36.480 --> 1:54:41.440
 going to, the thing is, since the first draft is going to be crap, if you're editing as you write,

1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:46.320
 it's going to be extremely discouraging and it's also trying to drive and then doing reverse at the

1:54:46.320 --> 1:54:51.920
 same time. It's a completely nonsensical way to do it. Get it all out there. Don't look it over.

1:54:51.920 --> 1:54:56.880
 If you have a great line put on your phone and then add it to the draft, so it'll be a complete

1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:00.880
 slog, but editing that slog is going to be a lot easier than creating it to begin with.

1:55:00.880 --> 1:55:06.080
 And when you see those disparate lines all laid out on the page, how difficult does it to

1:55:06.080 --> 1:55:12.480
 then start stitching it together? Do you find that when you look at a list of those things,

1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:17.360
 the final product will look very different? Yes. Or will you actually use those lines?

1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:22.160
 No, I will use those lines. Then I have a file called scraps. So if the line's no longer used,

1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:26.160
 I put it in my scrap pile. I'd love to see what's in the scrap pile.

1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:31.520
 Okay, yeah, sure. One of the things I've been pulling scraps is a lot of times when I was earlier

1:55:31.520 --> 1:55:38.320
 writing, I would have contemporary references. And I realized that that's bad because I want

1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:45.520
 the reader to be in the past as the present. So if you're talking about, let's say 1901 and

1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:48.800
 then you're referring to Obama, that screws people up. So I had to pull all those.

1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:55.120
 Okay, let's talk about some New Year's resolutions. Do you ever do New Year's resolutions? Do you

1:55:55.120 --> 1:56:01.040
 ever think like that? Like take a special day in the year to think about how you're going to try

1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:05.040
 to change yourself? Or do you try to transform yourself every single day when you wake up?

1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:09.920
 Well, I usually have several projects I'm working on at once. So there's always incremental

1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:15.360
 progress in those. You know, it's nice to have a deadline. By the end of 2022,

1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:23.040
 I'll accomplish this, kind of like to hold yourself responsible. And then you could do that at the

1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:28.080
 beginning of the year to think about that. Both philosophically, like what kind of big,

1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:33.920
 not projects that you can quantify, but more like, how can I change my life? Or like I mentioned,

1:56:33.920 --> 1:56:38.400
 take the leap of different kinds. And then there's specific things like finish the book.

1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:46.560
 I, years ago, and I'm, I think on some level, you much less than me, but I think you're increasing

1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:52.320
 in this direction. I realized it's more, I have to learn how to be a surfer and not a driver.

1:56:52.320 --> 1:56:58.240
 Because when you reach the level we're at in our careers or in our place in the culture,

1:56:58.880 --> 1:57:02.240
 a lot of this is luck. And a lot of this is just like,

1:57:03.040 --> 1:57:08.560
 like I'm just going along for the ride because it's kind of counterintuitive. Like, you know,

1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:16.640
 like the success of the anarchist handbook was counterintuitive. So all I'm hoping for is,

1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:27.120
 you know, getting the book done. I am extremely proud of it. And just also, you know, building a,

1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:32.320
 you know, we had Thanksgiving together at Blair's house, just building a great

1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:39.760
 upcoming community here in Austin, which has happened very quickly. I was, there was going to

1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:47.520
 be another surprise here. There's a girl named Natalie Sidesurf, and she makes these ultra

1:57:47.520 --> 1:57:51.520
 realistic cakes. Like if you've seen those cakes online where it looks like you're cutting a puppy,

1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:53.520
 like she makes those kind of things. So she's here.

1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:55.120
 In Austin?

1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:56.400
 Yeah, you know, so.

1:57:56.400 --> 1:57:57.520
 Like moved permanently?

1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:01.040
 I think she's been here for a while. I've never, I haven't met her yet, but I just kind of

1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:06.880
 chatted with her. So there's just, it's just so many, there's so many scenes happening here

1:58:06.880 --> 1:58:08.960
 that are overlapping.

1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:15.440
 So in general, finish the book, keep building a community. I mean, you've already been doing

1:58:15.440 --> 1:58:17.200
 that here. You've been here several months.

1:58:17.200 --> 1:58:20.640
 I've been making a point to introduce people to each other and everyone's just really getting

1:58:20.640 --> 1:58:21.440
 along very well.

1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.960
 That's great. And the book is the focus.

1:58:24.960 --> 1:58:26.320
 The book is the focus.

1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:29.600
 What about the podcast that you're doing? You're welcome.

1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:35.040
 Yes. I mean, I enjoy it and it's been growing a lot. I finally got a new computer,

1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:40.080
 which my friend Jay installed so I can have a decent camera because of my old,

1:58:41.680 --> 1:58:47.840
 this is my mindset as a hoarder. Like I was more interested in spending money on a Pareto

1:58:47.840 --> 1:58:52.320
 autograph than actually getting a computer that's from the 20th century.

1:58:54.160 --> 1:59:03.360
 So, but I'm such an old school person in that in my head podcasts are like so ephemeral.

1:59:03.360 --> 1:59:09.600
 Like there's some episodes of my podcast I'm really proud of and there's a lot of friendships

1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:12.880
 I've made as a result of it that really mean a lot to me. No question. It's made my life

1:59:12.880 --> 1:59:18.000
 a profoundly better place, but it's not the same as that book on the shelf, especially when the

1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:22.000
 book is something that I think matters much more than I do.

1:59:22.720 --> 1:59:28.160
 Yeah. There's a permanence to it. There's a seriousness to laying down the words on paper,

1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:29.600
 like really giving them thought.

1:59:29.600 --> 1:59:36.480
 Yeah. That's true, but I'm a huge fan of podcasts. You don't listen to podcasts

1:59:36.480 --> 1:59:41.920
 much. It's just fascinating to... Yeah, like at all. I don't know how mine is so successful.

1:59:45.600 --> 1:59:52.640
 Yeah. I just love the medium. I love the authenticity, the realness of the medium.

1:59:52.640 --> 1:59:57.680
 That's really nice. I just understood for the... It's starting to click because

1:59:57.680 --> 2:00:05.520
 my pal Blair White, she was just on Rogan and the first 10 minutes, I was so angry.

2:00:06.160 --> 2:00:11.840
 I was sitting there yelling at the screen because Joe and Blair, you would think that

2:00:11.840 --> 2:00:16.720
 they're going to start talking about Trump or trans issues or move into Austin.

2:00:16.720 --> 2:00:20.880
 They start talking about shark reproduction and neither of these dumbasses knew anything

2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:24.560
 about it and I know a lot about it and they're like, oh, is it like this? I'll do the sharks,

2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:27.360
 lay eggs and I'm sitting there. I'm like, if you don't know why you're talking about this,

2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:33.040
 why? Why are you talking? I could also see why people like these shows,

2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:35.440
 because they feel like they're friends of the people, like they're sitting in the room,

2:00:35.440 --> 2:00:38.560
 because I felt like it was in that room and I wanted to shake both of them.

2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:43.760
 Yeah, in the room. To know what about transforming yourself and new resolutions like that.

2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:49.520
 Oh, I'm doing a slight bulk now. I'm almost at my heaviest weight ever, but I couldn't

2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:53.680
 go to the gym this week because I'm a little underweather. That's been a little frustrating,

2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:59.040
 but yeah. So we're going to get some more modeling pics. What are we, what's, what's,

2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:05.600
 is there goals there? So my heaviest, I'm four eight. The heaviest I've ever been was when,

2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:09.440
 and this is when I was like, he's exaggerating. He's not at that. That's the metric.

2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:17.040
 Oh, sorry. Are you talking about your height? Yeah. Yeah. Barely four, six. So the heaviest

2:01:17.040 --> 2:01:21.040
 I've ever been when I was like really high body fat, because I was just, because I learned,

2:01:21.040 --> 2:01:24.480
 because I couldn't gain weight as a kid. So when I figured out I could actually gain weight, I like,

2:01:24.480 --> 2:01:32.880
 I was 164.5. So I want to hit 165 and then see, take it from there. I have a friend who's been

2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:38.320
 helping me, my buddy Trey Goff and this kid stronger, his Jake, his username on Instagram

2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:45.600
 is stronger, both the number five instead of the letter S. But he does, I've never, it looks like

2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:52.000
 it's Photoshop, like your brain can't process it. You know the human flag? No. Oh yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:58.960
 He does human flag push ups. Wow. So he is horizontal parallel to the ground, right? He's

2:01:58.960 --> 2:02:05.600
 holding himself up like a flag, but he could also do this while, so he's moving parallel to the earth

2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:10.640
 side to side while how it's just crazy. That's really difficult. So you're interested in that

2:02:10.640 --> 2:02:14.560
 kind of stuff. No, but I'm saying like he's been helping me out. So like the guy knows what he's

2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:18.880
 doing. He's just a really impressive kid. I love that kind of stuff, like body weight stuff. So

2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:25.440
 my primary mode of working out, it's very like the, you ever seen Leon, like the professional

2:02:25.440 --> 2:02:32.000
 that with Natalie Portman, that movie, I have a pull up thing as you push up some pull ups. It's

2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:38.880
 very like, I'm just missing the milk. I like working out at home just like that. And the body

2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:42.800
 weight stuff, you can go so much with it and it's super functional for everything else you live in,

2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:48.400
 for life, for living life well. I'm on the other hand, I don't care with functionality.

2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:52.640
 The thing that really bothers me, like I go, I know Joe's thinking of opening up a gym,

2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:58.640
 like a private gym. There's only like one power cage here at the golds I go to. I don't know

2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:02.080
 what source that there's only one or that sometimes people aren't using it. I'm like,

2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:07.840
 no one's doing deadlifts in here. No one, just me. It's golds. By the way, I don't want to say

2:03:07.840 --> 2:03:15.360
 where I'll tell you off Mike, but there's a few really ghetto places around Austin that are just

2:03:15.360 --> 2:03:20.880
 like these shitty gyms that nobody wants to go to, but they have a rack, they have like, if you

2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:25.920
 want to lift heavy, that kind of stuff. But are they 24 hours? That's the thing, golds. Oh, but

2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:32.560
 they're 24 hours in the following way. There's a code. Okay. And you just go in. Okay. And you

2:03:32.560 --> 2:03:38.000
 turn on the lights and then you work out. I don't want to meet people. Exactly. Well, that's just

2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:42.400
 not true. Sometimes there's people and they're great. Yeah. Like, and I've had fans give us

2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:52.240
 me a goals and they've all been cool, except, except, except, except if I have my headphones on

2:03:53.280 --> 2:04:00.320
 and I'm doing deadlifts, I don't need you to come over, tap my ear and start giving me critiques

2:04:00.320 --> 2:04:10.000
 about my form. It's actually happened. Yes. I'm still angry about it. I'm pulling my 150 in peace.

2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:18.320
 Thank you. Yeah. People are hilarious. I was recently in, actually, the wildest day ever in

2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:26.560
 my life. So many things happened in a row. So when to a wedding in LA. Andrew? Andrew Schultz.

2:04:26.560 --> 2:04:33.680
 And with Whitney Cummings and Joe Rogan and a bunch of other fascinating people. It's just

2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:39.280
 speaking of weirdos. There's the comedian, like the reason I find the comedians awesome.

2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:44.000
 One, they're authentic. They're just cool people. Yeah. Yeah. But they're also just weird. Like,

2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:49.520
 you don't become a comedian for not being like fucked up in all kinds of different ways. Anyway,

2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:56.320
 so there's the wedding. I'm, you know, me, it was only carbs at the wedding. So I didn't eat. I didn't

2:04:56.320 --> 2:05:04.800
 eat for a long time. So I was like already fasted 20 hours, 25 hours. And so that this whole story

2:05:04.800 --> 2:05:13.520
 of everything that happens is, is Lex like 40 hours fasted with Joe Rogan drinking a lot of whiskey.

2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:18.640
 And so you were drinking too heavy on 40. Oh my God, that's crazy. So it is calories.

2:05:18.640 --> 2:05:24.160
 That was my only source of calories, the whiskey. And I, so I didn't trust myself with carbs when

2:05:24.160 --> 2:05:29.920
 I'm drunk. I just don't enjoy it because I'll forget. And I just enjoy eating like a strict

2:05:29.920 --> 2:05:37.280
 healthy diet when I'm drunk because I'd rather eat more food that's healthy versus not. And so

2:05:37.280 --> 2:05:44.800
 anyway, so then we went to Vegas together and then just kept doing wild thing after another

2:05:44.800 --> 2:05:50.320
 wild thing. Rogan opened up for Wendy Cummings. He just like showed up at a random party that he

2:05:50.320 --> 2:05:55.520
 wasn't invited. And he did a thing. He almost started a fight because some guys said stop,

2:05:55.520 --> 2:06:02.640
 spread yell that him said stop spreading misinformation. And then we run into David

2:06:02.640 --> 2:06:08.480
 Goggins of all, this is my first time meeting David. I've talked to David a lot over the phone.

2:06:08.480 --> 2:06:13.520
 And we were supposed to do a thing together. And this is me trash out of my mind meeting David

2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:18.960
 for the first time with this incredible wife, Rogan's wife was there. By the way, Joe Rogan's

2:06:18.960 --> 2:06:27.840
 wife, David's wife made me realize that I really want to be married because they're not, they make

2:06:30.240 --> 2:06:34.000
 their partners better. Yeah. Like that I was,

2:06:36.400 --> 2:06:40.720
 there's a certain aspect of marriage that I'm afraid of that like your partner takes you away

2:06:40.720 --> 2:06:47.040
 from life. You don't get to experience life as much. But this was like, they were enriching them.

2:06:47.040 --> 2:06:51.120
 I don't know. It's like the world's most powerful support group. It was cool. Anyway,

2:06:51.120 --> 2:06:57.520
 so then of course drunk Lex is challenges Goggins to pushups. I saw that's on Instagram.

2:06:57.520 --> 2:07:03.280
 So we're in the middle of your suit in this suit in the middle of casino. There's a crowd

2:07:03.280 --> 2:07:09.440
 gathering. Like it's Joe Rogan, me and David Goggins, and I'm just doing pushups with them.

2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:14.560
 And Rogan is like commentating and yelling and screaming. It was surreal. And just going

2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:21.040
 on to the next thing and next thing and next thing like this. And then drove all the way from Vegas

2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:28.960
 back to LA with Joe and Whitney and his wife. And it was like, what is this? And all of it is

2:07:28.960 --> 2:07:37.760
 done in 24 hours. The one valuable lesson is don't fast and drink like excessively. So I've

2:07:37.760 --> 2:07:45.040
 learned that because what happens is liquor hits your mind. My mind. Sorry. I'll speak about my

2:07:45.040 --> 2:07:52.240
 particular mind. Like the intellectual part of my brain got hit really hard, really fast. So I was

2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:57.360
 not able to even more so than usual stitch together sentences. I understood everybody well.

2:07:58.480 --> 2:08:05.280
 So like made your name again. Yeah, I was. Yeah. So like meeting David, I want to say

2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:09.840
 so many things. He's so inspiring to me, right? But all I said was like, hello.

2:08:12.400 --> 2:08:16.480
 And I remember like opening my mouth to like try to say more. And I was like,

2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:20.800
 and then I would just close my mouth and not be able to say anymore.

2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:28.320
 This is why this is one of the reasons I don't drink ever. Yeah. It removes certain barriers.

2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:33.600
 Like it allows you to maybe have fun that you wouldn't otherwise. But yeah, definitely for

2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:40.000
 personal values and intellectual eloquence. And I also hate being hungover. The hungover part.

2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:46.720
 Yeah. That's the worst. And you also like I did this to myself. Yeah. But it also teaches me that

2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:52.320
 this too shall pass because I've been hungover and I've quit drinking so many times in my life

2:08:52.960 --> 2:08:56.560
 that it realizes, it makes you realize that all the unpleasant feelings,

2:08:57.120 --> 2:09:01.840
 all you have to do is just wait it out and be fine. It took me a long time to realize that

2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:06.160
 that expression means the other thing. What's the other thing? If things are going great,

2:09:06.160 --> 2:09:11.120
 this too shall pass. Yeah. I always thought about it. No, I always thought about it as being more

2:09:11.120 --> 2:09:14.320
 like don't worry if things are bad, it'll pass. It's like it's also like if something's going

2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:19.360
 great, it's not going to be this way forever. It's like Bukowski said love is a fog that

2:09:19.360 --> 2:09:27.760
 fades with the first daylight of reality. Do you think love can last? Oh yeah, we're going to win.

2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:35.120
 Who's we? The good guys. Didn't Hitler also think he's the good guys? He's wrong.

2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:38.720
 Because you know why? Why? He didn't win.

2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:48.240
 So you think it's permanent? So this one time the good guys winning, it'll last. It won't pass

2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:57.040
 because I think all of it passes unfortunately. I think we're going to win and win big in the

2:09:57.040 --> 2:10:03.680
 not so distant future. Do you have specific things in mind or no? Or just a sense about

2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:09.840
 human civilization, about society waking up? I don't know about waking up, but I think the

2:10:11.440 --> 2:10:20.400
 increased understanding on all sides of the political spectrum that corporate America

2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:27.760
 and corporate news outlets are self motivated actors and those motivations are often inimical

2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:33.760
 to what others would regard as desirable is something that I think is happening with

2:10:33.760 --> 2:10:40.240
 increasing frequency. So what do you think about the political landscape in general?

2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:45.440
 You had a great conversation with Glenn Beck and he said that he talked to Trump and

2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:51.600
 believes that Donald Trump is definitely running in 2024 or very likely running in 2024.

2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:58.000
 I think he said he thinks he'll have a good chance of winning or I don't remember that, but

2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:05.040
 the fact that he was running was a surprise to you. Do you think Donald Trump would be running in 2024?

2:11:05.040 --> 2:11:11.760
 Given that Glenn Beck has a much better relationship with Trump than I do to put it

2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:16.800
 mildly, if Glenn Beck is certain this is going to happen, I would defer to Glenn Beck's judgment.

2:11:17.920 --> 2:11:20.240
 Do you think he has a chance of winning? Do you think he'll win?

2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:24.720
 Anyone in a binary political system who's the nominee has a chance. Like whoever the Republican

2:11:24.720 --> 2:11:30.480
 Democrat has a chance. I think also it's a lot easier to vote for someone that you have voted

2:11:30.480 --> 2:11:34.720
 for in the past. So that's why incumbents have a big advantage. There's not that psychological

2:11:34.720 --> 2:11:41.280
 barrier to cover. I think it's also useful for Trump that he's banished for social media because

2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:47.920
 then he doesn't have to have the responsibility of governing and all the costs of that because no

2:11:47.920 --> 2:11:52.080
 matter what decisions you make while governing, some people aren't going to like that. So he gets to

2:11:52.080 --> 2:11:58.480
 kind of be above the radar or below the radar rather to some extent. I don't think it's at all a

2:11:58.480 --> 2:12:03.520
 given that he would get the nomination. When I say the good guys are going to win, I certainly

2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:09.360
 don't mean Donald Trump. I don't think victory is going to come as a consequence of Washington.

2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:13.680
 Do you want to make America great again? I think America is great.

2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:22.320
 Does my fail the tempted humor? One of many. There are also hats that Julianne and Jim

2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:27.520
 Jeffords wore that said people can look this up. They said because they were in South the border,

2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:39.040
 make Mexico great again also. That's in me. It was like just the syntax there.

2:12:41.120 --> 2:12:48.480
 Okay. So you don't even think you might get the nomination? Who else might?

2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:56.560
 If you had asked three years out who the nominee in 2020 would be, Donald Trump wasn't even or

2:12:56.560 --> 2:13:01.040
 2016 rather, wasn't even on the radar screen. So we have a long way to go.

2:13:01.840 --> 2:13:07.520
 Even two years is a long way to go? Yeah. Especially because we're coming out of COVID.

2:13:07.520 --> 2:13:10.960
 There might be some governor who becomes a rock star for some reason. Maybe someone's

2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:16.480
 going to have some congressmen might have some big moment where they're screaming at somebody and

2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:19.760
 all of a sudden they become a rock star in the Republican Party.

2:13:19.760 --> 2:13:26.720
 It could be one of the celebrities we don't think about. Donald Trump is essentially not a political

2:13:26.720 --> 2:13:38.000
 figure before he ran. So it could be any of the famous right leaning celebrities. I don't even

2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:42.800
 know which way McConaughey leans. No, I think he's the lefty or he was going to run as a Democrat,

2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:46.720
 but he's not running. But people like that just might step into the ring.

2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:50.160
 Yeah. I don't think they'd have that much of a chance because I think the Republican Party,

2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:55.680
 there's an asymmetry. They'd be much more skeptical of like an actor than Democrats would be because

2:13:55.680 --> 2:14:00.640
 they would regard that actor as coming as a kind of mentoring candidate or whatever.

2:14:00.640 --> 2:14:04.720
 Right. But there's other kinds of celebrities like Jaco could run as a Republican.

2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:06.640
 That's a good example. Yeah. Yeah.

2:14:06.640 --> 2:14:09.440
 That would be interesting. So military person. Right. Yeah.

2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:14.080
 But already like for example, Dr. Oz is thinking of running for,

2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:18.240
 is going to run for the Senate in Pennsylvania. And there's already been a lot of research

2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:23.600
 people slamming him on Twitter and social media for past positions he's taken. So

2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:30.080
 you know, the Santas is the figure of the moment, but Scott Walker was the figure of the moment in

2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:37.920
 the 2016 cycle and he didn't even make it to Iowa. Yeah. And I wonder what role does COVID play in

2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:46.160
 all of this in terms of, you know, I'm mostly optimistic and hopeful about the world. Like

2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:52.320
 when I look at the world, I'm excited by most things. I've been a little bit or a lot disappointed

2:14:52.320 --> 2:15:00.320
 by the lack of great leadership in a time of trouble. Because to me, one of the great things

2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:08.720
 about a difficult time is it brings out the great leaders. Again, it's the up and down

2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:13.760
 things. Like you don't want to ask for war. You don't want to ask for pandemics. But when they

2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:20.400
 happen, it's a great opportunity for the human spirit to flourish. And the fact that it didn't

2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:25.520
 quite in the way that I hoped it would is disappointing. I think there's still time too,

2:15:25.520 --> 2:15:33.600
 because people are trying to figure out what to do as we emerge from the fog. Yeah. So I'm excited

2:15:33.600 --> 2:15:40.240
 by 2020. For somebody said this dark cynical thing, I hope this is not true, but like that

2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:48.160
 there was some doubt about the results of the election in 2020, that in 2024, both sides,

2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:57.360
 it'll just start becoming standard to completely reject the results of an election no matter

2:15:57.360 --> 2:16:02.640
 who wins. Well, that's my perspective. I don't regard elections as legitimate. And I see what

2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:07.040
 you're saying, not in the terms of that basically the process itself was illegitimate. Yes. There's

2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:12.720
 like cheating or something. Yeah. But I think that that's pretty much a given. It has been a

2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:17.600
 given. Like it's either Republicans often say, oh, they got all these illegals to vote. Or the

2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:22.960
 Democrats will say the voting machines were hacked or the media, so on and so forth. Because despite

2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:28.080
 all the people flapping their guns about democracy, they only like democracy when it gives them the

2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:32.960
 results that they want. Can I ask you about something else that Glenn Beck said that I

2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:38.720
 thought was really interesting. I agree with him very much on this. And I was refreshing to hear,

2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:45.280
 although he kind of made a turn it into a point about why Trump is great or whatever. But the

2:16:45.280 --> 2:16:51.280
 point was the following, which is he doesn't want to talk to anybody who can't say at least one nice

2:16:51.280 --> 2:16:58.000
 thing about everyone. So like, if you don't like Donald Trump, if you don't like Joe Biden,

2:16:59.360 --> 2:17:04.480
 you should still be able to say one nice thing like legitimate nice, not just like a dismissive

2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:11.600
 nice thing, but legitimately say what is one nice thing they did or like, or who they are as a person.

2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:18.880
 And not not like saying Donald Trump. It's funny sometimes like no like legitimate where you really

2:17:18.880 --> 2:17:23.920
 mean it. And it's been really troubling to me how few people are able to do that about political

2:17:23.920 --> 2:17:30.960
 figures. I had a lot of people. I think I tweeted something like this leading up to the election,

2:17:31.520 --> 2:17:37.520
 saying like you should be able to say something nice about both Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:46.000
 And I've had old friends. I don't want to say specific, I guess, to call them out, but they

2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:51.680
 several people and one in particular like wrote me this long, like several page email.

2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:57.600
 It was Sam. It was Sam Harris. Was it Sam Harris? Sam Harris. No. But

2:17:59.600 --> 2:18:04.160
 I have a lot of conversations with Sam Harris now and Joe on both sides. It's like the devil and

2:18:04.160 --> 2:18:09.840
 the angel on both sides. I don't know which one is which, but they're both devils.

2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:20.080
 And they said, how could you say, how could you even consider like that there's something positive

2:18:20.080 --> 2:18:26.560
 about Donald Trump? Yeah, he's an easy one. He has three wives with three kids with each,

2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:32.480
 but the kids get along. I think that's really commendable that Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump

2:18:32.480 --> 2:18:36.320
 and Barron can all get along with each other given the circumstances. I think that speaks to

2:18:36.320 --> 2:18:42.880
 something as someone as a father, Ivanka. So on the family level. And I see the same thing with

2:18:42.880 --> 2:18:50.400
 actually one of the reasons I always found Joe Biden fascinating is he's had a lot of really

2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:55.680
 traumatic things happen in his life. Yeah. And if I shit my pants in front of the pope, I'd be

2:18:55.680 --> 2:19:02.800
 traumatized too. I'm talking to a master troll about something sensitive and beautiful that

2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:06.880
 is a man suffering with a loss. I kind of know what he feels like right now. I'm pretending

2:19:06.880 --> 2:19:15.120
 you're the pope. This chair is ruined. Sorry, Elon. You'd have to sit in it.

2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:20.240
 Why does this chair feel like I'm sitting in a swamp?

2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:24.160
 I can't look. You have stuff to show. Can you forego chair?

2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:28.080
 I'll send you a protestant. That's a pretty good Elon impression.

2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:33.040
 But yeah, I mean, like one criticism I told Joe,

2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:40.960
 Rogan is like, he has trouble finding one positive thing to say about Joe Biden, for example.

2:19:40.960 --> 2:19:47.760
 And I just don't, I don't like that. I want, I think, I mean, I'm a big believer in the shit

2:19:47.760 --> 2:19:53.520
 sandwich sticking on topic. Here's an easy one. I think Joe Biden clearly is a very amiable person.

2:19:54.400 --> 2:19:58.880
 What's amiable? It gets along with people. It seems really clear that maybe before president,

2:19:58.880 --> 2:20:01.840
 because it's different when you're the president, but that he could call a lot of these Republican

2:20:01.840 --> 2:20:05.200
 senators, get them on the phone and have a conversation with them. Yeah. And it's not

2:20:05.200 --> 2:20:09.520
 some kind of manipulation. To some extent it is because they're all politicians, but he clearly

2:20:09.520 --> 2:20:15.280
 seemed to be able to get, wasn't like an ideologue. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, but there's,

2:20:15.280 --> 2:20:20.960
 I mean, maybe I'm a sucker for that kind of thing, but the blue collar thing, like riding the train,

2:20:20.960 --> 2:20:26.800
 you know, there's ways to connect with people and not, it's seeing them as equals,

2:20:26.800 --> 2:20:30.400
 no matter where their walks of life are. And I love it when presidents do that.

2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:37.840
 To some degree, because of the wealth under which Donald Trump existed for a lot of his

2:20:37.840 --> 2:20:44.960
 recent life, he's less able to do that quite naturally. Maybe sometimes Obama wasn't quite

2:20:44.960 --> 2:20:50.320
 able to do that. Who's more blue collar Trump or Biden? And you can easily make the case for both,

2:20:50.320 --> 2:20:56.800
 I think. You could. No, not the blue collar, but like, like literally be able to fit in at a bar,

2:20:56.800 --> 2:21:01.360
 at a local bar and just like, I can see both of them. Yeah, you're right. I could see both of

2:21:01.360 --> 2:21:05.760
 them. Yeah. In fact, Obama doesn't quite. No, because he's got that Ivy League. Yeah, the Ivy

2:21:05.760 --> 2:21:12.720
 League thing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right. Somehow Donald Trump can too. No, he's not. Yeah,

2:21:12.720 --> 2:21:16.640
 you can see him having a beer with the guys and yelling at the screen. This is bullshit. Change

2:21:16.640 --> 2:21:22.880
 the channel. Yeah. I mean, I hope people do that. I think that's one of the most unpleasant things to

2:21:22.880 --> 2:21:30.880
 me is they're not able to empathize with the fact that half the country voted for another person.

2:21:30.880 --> 2:21:35.600
 Well, it's also then it's just a bad strategy. If you can't figure out why half the country is

2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:38.960
 voting for someone you guard as like a demon, well, then how are you going to supposed to fight

2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:44.400
 this demon? Like, you know, when I did your reader, the North Korea book, it's like, don't you want

2:21:44.400 --> 2:21:50.080
 to understand how these people get to where they got? It's unknown saying that he's a good person,

2:21:50.080 --> 2:21:54.800
 but like there's a logic to their, there's a method to their madness. You've talked about

2:21:54.800 --> 2:21:59.680
 national divorce a few times. I've seen a couple of videos recently where you're responding to

2:21:59.680 --> 2:22:08.080
 articles. It's kind of cool. Can you talk about this idea of national divorce and as it stands

2:22:08.080 --> 2:22:15.120
 today, arguing for it maybe. And if you could, just out of curious in the context of those videos,

2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:20.800
 if you can steal man and argument against. So I was the first one to kind of bring this

2:22:20.800 --> 2:22:27.040
 issue back into the national conversation. I wrote a piece for Observer in 2016,

2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:32.480
 then Jesse Kelly had a piece a few months after that. David Boy just recently did a piece on his

2:22:32.480 --> 2:22:39.840
 stop stack earlier this year. And it's become enough of a mainstreamed idea that paleontology

2:22:39.840 --> 2:22:44.800
 outlets like the national review have felt the need to respond to them. So the point being that America

2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:50.080
 has had at least two cultures since the beginning, and that there's absolutely no reason, and these

2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:55.680
 cultures in recent years, and this was in 2016, not mentioned 2021, have been increasingly antagonistic

2:22:55.680 --> 2:23:00.960
 toward one another and have even lost the ability to communicate. They're using language in different

2:23:00.960 --> 2:23:09.360
 ways. And that there's no reason for this to continue any further. And you live your life,

2:23:09.360 --> 2:23:16.960
 we'll live ours, and good bye and good luck. There's no ill will. Now, there's lots of

2:23:16.960 --> 2:23:22.240
 arguments against them. Some of those are completely, I think, stupid. The stupidest one

2:23:22.960 --> 2:23:28.240
 is, well, that's what China wants. Okay, well, I mean, I'm not going to live my life saying,

2:23:28.240 --> 2:23:33.360
 I'm just going to do the opposite of whatever China wants. That's not logic. That's not a good

2:23:33.360 --> 2:23:37.120
 pathway. Now, I'm not saying they're right or wrong, but that's not a reason why we're another.

2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:42.160
 Yeah, you're bringing up China or Russia. That's exactly what China or Russia want.

2:23:42.160 --> 2:23:55.360
 But the strong way to phrase that is it weakens America, not just the one America, but

2:23:55.360 --> 2:24:04.080
 both sides in the divorce will be much weaker than they individually were together. So in

2:24:04.080 --> 2:24:10.880
 that sense, not that you have to care about what China thinks, but it's a big step backwards.

2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:15.280
 Yes, I think in the short term, it is absolutely a big step backwards in terms of power. There's no

2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:20.000
 question that when you're trying to reestablish a society, there's going to be a transition period,

2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:24.240
 that transition period is going to be costly. Each side starts wondering, wait a minute,

2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:26.960
 why are we still doing this? We don't have to anywhere. We're not living with them, so on and

2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:33.200
 so forth. So that's going to be a concern. I don't think that the whole point of America,

2:24:34.160 --> 2:24:38.880
 or even a large primary point of America, is to be a bulwark against Chinese power.

2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:45.600
 And there's going to be very few people on earth, given my work, who have as much informed hatred

2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:52.640
 and contempt for the Chinese government as I do. Certainly, next to the North Korean people,

2:24:52.640 --> 2:24:58.560
 maybe the people from Eritrea, there's few populations who I'm as worried about as the people

2:24:58.560 --> 2:25:03.520
 under the rule of the Red Chinese. My steelman argument is there's no way this is going to be

2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:08.720
 peaceful, because the lines don't separate out well. So all you're doing is basically just

2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:14.000
 replicating the problem, because the disparity isn't between during the Civil War North and South.

2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:19.360
 It's like it's between New York City and upstate New York, between Chicago, downstate Chicago.

2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:24.880
 Once you get outside of LA and Sacramento, California in many ways is like Kentucky.

2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:29.120
 So it doesn't make sense. So that's a strong argument. I mean, you've talked about that

2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:34.480
 this process will be painful. It can't be. And we're not just talking about violence. It could be just

2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:41.120
 even the Civil War, you could divide it somewhat cleanly. Obviously, the kind of national

2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:46.160
 divorce you might be suggesting is that people are living amongst each other. So you have to

2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:50.400
 literally move. It's complicated. Right. So that is a very strong argument. It's

2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:57.120
 I think a cogent argument against it. Two is it's not just China. It's that there's a lot of

2:25:57.920 --> 2:26:02.640
 bad actors in the world who maybe aren't like China certainly wants to carry itself and have an

2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:08.400
 appearance at least on the world stage as civilized and a leader. There's lots of smaller

2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:13.280
 countries who without us are going to feel comfortable doing some very nefarious things.

2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:18.240
 And they're not going to be scared of us anymore. And so that would be a bigger concern

2:26:18.240 --> 2:26:24.160
 in many regards than China. So I think that's a reasonable one. It could be that both sides,

2:26:24.160 --> 2:26:29.520
 if this happens, are going to instead of work toward better things that make you side bad would

2:26:29.520 --> 2:26:35.600
 get worse. And that's having those push towards the malevolent extremes is I think a very legitimate

2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:40.480
 criticism and a concern. I mean, as you suggested, there's no guarantee that won't happen.

2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:46.560
 Correct at all. Also, there's a I think a reasonable argument to make is like, are you

2:26:46.560 --> 2:26:52.480
 America just as a symbol and the myth of America? And I don't mean myth in a negative sense. Do

2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:57.040
 you really want to throw that in the garbage? Like this meant a lot for a lot of people and a lot

2:26:57.040 --> 2:27:01.840
 for history. You're just going to be like, okay, good, good work. We were done here. Let's shut

2:27:01.840 --> 2:27:09.360
 the lights. So that's I think a reasonable argument. So those are the biggest ones, I would say.

2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:16.000
 And still, what is the case for national divorce and along which lines? So like

2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:24.240
 in making the case for national divorce, if it is desired, based on which kind of ideas do you

2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:29.680
 think it should be carried through? Honestly, I don't know that it has to be idea based. Like,

2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:35.760
 for example, when Czechoslovakia broke up, when Norway and Sweden broke up, it wasn't really

2:27:35.760 --> 2:27:43.680
 ideological. It was more cultural. So I always say divorced into two, but it would probably

2:27:43.680 --> 2:27:49.040
 make more sense if it was like five. Because the Northeast, certainly New England has their own

2:27:49.040 --> 2:27:54.000
 culture. The West Coast has their own kind of culture. I don't know. The thing is,

2:27:54.640 --> 2:28:02.400
 into any kind of persuasion technique, right? Like once people are start, there's a difference

2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:06.960
 between convincing someone they want to buy a car and what features you want. So if you're at the

2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:09.760
 point where we're arguing about the features, then my work here is done. You know what I mean?

2:28:09.760 --> 2:28:13.360
 Like I don't have a dog in the fight in terms of what it's going to look like. I just want to get

2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:17.920
 to the point where you're at least considering seriously the idea of breaking up America.

2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:22.320
 And I would encourage people to go look at my article to see which I'm sure the arguments

2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:29.120
 still hold five years later. Do you have a kind of vision of which of the two or which of the five?

2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:35.120
 Like do you actually have specific cultures or ideas?

2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:42.000
 I'll tell you exactly. If I told you and everyone listening in 2014, we weren't that long ago,

2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:48.640
 it was not long ago, which of these two things is more likely to happen? 2014, Texas secedes

2:28:49.440 --> 2:28:54.320
 or declares a session for America or Donald Trump gets elected president. Everyone's voting for

2:28:54.320 --> 2:29:00.080
 Texas in terms of prediction, which is more likely. So we had this one. So it's not at all

2:29:00.080 --> 2:29:03.840
 unlikely we're going to have this one. I don't know if that logic carries through. You can't just

2:29:03.840 --> 2:29:10.320
 say here's an unlikely thing that happened. Therefore, anything can happen. You just earlier

2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:14.160
 said anything that happened this episode, didn't you? Life is suffering. I wasn't listening to

2:29:14.160 --> 2:29:18.400
 half the things you're saying. You said it. I said it. Yes, you said anything can happen.

2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:22.640
 I'm definitely not here. I'm like you with podcasts. I do a podcast, but I don't listen to it.

2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:28.960
 It's kind of fun talking. Okay. So yeah, yeah, yeah, it can happen. But in which,

2:29:28.960 --> 2:29:33.360
 I guess I'm asking, would you stay in Texas? 100%. So Texas and I'd run for office probably. It'd

2:29:33.360 --> 2:29:41.280
 be fun. I'm going to be the first president of Texas. I attended a debate between Yoram Books and

2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:47.920
 Yoram Hazoni. I don't know if you know who that is. The nationalist guy. Yeah. He wrote a book

2:29:47.920 --> 2:29:52.320
 called The Virtue of Nationalism. Yeah, I read that book. And they actually did a podcast with them.

2:29:52.320 --> 2:29:58.640
 They did a debate. Oh, they both run here? Okay. It was quite interesting. And I tried to wear my

2:29:58.640 --> 2:30:05.120
 Michael Malis hat. So the... You're wearing it now. You borrowed that from me. Yeah.

2:30:07.680 --> 2:30:14.800
 It's funny because the metaphor applies across all of these level of collectivism. So he was

2:30:14.800 --> 2:30:20.480
 arguing that for the power of nation, so he would be arguing against national divorce.

2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:28.880
 But he was also arguing for marriage, the power of actual marriage between individuals. I think

2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:34.160
 he's a conservative. And what I really like about him is there's a clear philosophy of

2:30:34.160 --> 2:30:40.880
 conservatism that he expresses. And I think a lot of people get behind that philosophy. Because

2:30:40.880 --> 2:30:47.360
 to me, like conservatism and liberalism often is very kind of used loosely. Yes. He has a

2:30:47.360 --> 2:30:52.960
 clear philosophy that he's expressing there and is grounded in tradition. He has a lot of value

2:30:52.960 --> 2:30:59.360
 in tradition. And so it's the thing you said about America. Like one of the arguments against

2:30:59.360 --> 2:31:07.200
 national divorce is like, listen, we've been at it for a while. Like there is a lot of value in

2:31:07.200 --> 2:31:11.440
 the fact that we've been at it for a while. Don't just throw it all away all the time. So he says,

2:31:11.440 --> 2:31:19.680
 like philosophically, he seems in a lot of walks of life, revolution should be avoided as much as

2:31:19.680 --> 2:31:25.600
 possible. I agree. And so it's kind of interesting. So he makes the case that there's something

2:31:25.600 --> 2:31:34.000
 fundamentally powerful about the nation that we... It's a nice way to group a culture.

2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:42.240
 And so national divorce, I guess, goes against that. Do you find some aspect of the virtue of

2:31:42.240 --> 2:31:49.040
 nationalism, as you will put it, powerful? Well, powerful in a good sense?

2:31:49.040 --> 2:31:53.520
 In a good sense. So sorry. Yeah, in a good sense. It brings out the best in humans.

2:31:53.520 --> 2:31:56.960
 I don't know what the best, but it certainly brings out good things. I have that line I always say

2:31:56.960 --> 2:32:01.360
 about, I love my country. I hate the government because I love my country. So there is a love

2:32:01.360 --> 2:32:07.520
 of country. I think it's... I don't know that that's the... I think it's also the case because the

2:32:07.520 --> 2:32:13.280
 country happens to be America. Like, I don't know if I was living in whatever, I don't want to insult

2:32:13.280 --> 2:32:18.400
 someone's country. Canada, yeah. If I was living in Canada, I don't know that it'd be the...

2:32:18.400 --> 2:32:22.000
 This is a guy who calls basically every other country shithole country.

2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:26.960
 Yeah, that's true. That's the fact. Yeah. So it's either you're either... There's two types of

2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:34.080
 countries, Texas or shitholes. Oh, wow. You went full Texas. So you're okay burning the northeast

2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:40.400
 of the ground at this point. Okay, I'm hoping for it. I'm hoping. What they've done to New York City,

2:32:40.400 --> 2:32:46.640
 I will never forgive these people. And I hope that they suffer enormously consequences for what

2:32:46.640 --> 2:32:54.320
 they've done to New York. It's unconscionable the assault that they've done and had no remorse over

2:32:54.320 --> 2:32:59.280
 how many creative outlets that they've destroyed. Yeah, it's the cultural hub, cultural center of

2:32:59.280 --> 2:33:05.600
 the world in many ways. New York was the... This was the place where you go to put up your shingle

2:33:05.600 --> 2:33:11.600
 and move the needle and make things happen. And I would understand if it was like, okay,

2:33:11.600 --> 2:33:16.400
 we got to suffer through this for a year, but we're going to make sure all these businesses

2:33:16.400 --> 2:33:21.520
 have a kind of safety net to make sure that they kind of get through and survive this,

2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:26.240
 which they did to the banks in 2008, for example. And I'm saying this as an anarchist and there

2:33:26.240 --> 2:33:34.400
 was none of that. So I burn it down and salt the earth because it's like watching a zombie.

2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:41.520
 It's unnatural. It's an abomination. So I mean, sort of on the white pill side of things, I don't

2:33:41.520 --> 2:33:47.520
 know about you. Maybe I have a sense that both Silicon Valley, that for me personally, maybe I

2:33:47.520 --> 2:33:52.880
 have the same intensity of feeling as you do about New York. It's just disappointing to see it

2:33:53.760 --> 2:33:59.440
 be consumed with cynicism and a lot of other paralyzing forces. But I still have hope for

2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:08.400
 that place. I think maybe it's the Yoram kind of tradition hope that through momentum,

2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:19.120
 the strong reemerges. So I have hope for New York. I think New York will continue, not maybe on a

2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:25.360
 scale of years, but a scale of decades, it would be ups and downs where it reemerges as a cultural

2:34:25.360 --> 2:34:31.440
 center. I just can't imagine a place like New York is like Paris. There's going to be long

2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:34.720
 stretches of time where it leads the world.

2:34:34.720 --> 2:34:41.920
 But Paris has not been a cultural hub for a very long time. The days of Matisse and Picasso

2:34:41.920 --> 2:34:50.080
 and Gertrude Stein are long gone. It still is a hub. Even London isn't London.

2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:57.200
 But what is then? London is still London. Paris is still Paris. It's just not the Paris of old.

2:34:57.200 --> 2:35:03.680
 It's not London of old. London is still a place. It's a tech hub. It's a fashion hub.

2:35:03.680 --> 2:35:06.720
 It's a music hub. I mean, it's still a pretty strong hub.

2:35:06.720 --> 2:35:09.440
 Yeah, but not like during the Beatles era.

2:35:09.440 --> 2:35:09.760
 Right.

2:35:09.760 --> 2:35:11.840
 It's not like or during the Sex Pistols era.

2:35:11.840 --> 2:35:16.400
 But it could be just us romanticizing the past because what is a hub then?

2:35:16.400 --> 2:35:22.320
 No, it's not romanticizing the past because a hub is the place where everyone on earth

2:35:22.320 --> 2:35:27.840
 or our eyes are on you. So in the late 60s, the British in the mid 60s, the British invasion,

2:35:27.840 --> 2:35:31.920
 you know, the kinks and all these other bands coming out of Great Britain,

2:35:31.920 --> 2:35:35.680
 like they were the innovators. This was the place that was happening.

2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:37.040
 Well, in that sense, like...

2:35:37.040 --> 2:35:38.880
 And Brooklyn, you know, 15 years ago.

2:35:41.360 --> 2:35:47.520
 But I guess maybe in that sense, in the 21st century, geographical hubs are becoming a thing

2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:53.440
 of the past. So like, you can be a hub in the digital space now. So like, it's not... Maybe

2:35:53.440 --> 2:35:54.240
 you'll never have...

2:35:54.880 --> 2:36:00.400
 I don't think... I think there will always be... I mean, what I'm saying, digital space makes it

2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:05.200
 easier for, let's suppose, Cleveland to be a hub, because all you need like 10 people who

2:36:05.200 --> 2:36:08.400
 happen to live in Cleveland or, you know, Akron was a hub, a minor hub.

2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:14.160
 All it takes is 10 to 50 people to create a, yeah, and maybe even less, maybe just two or three

2:36:14.160 --> 2:36:19.040
 or four people. But I mean, there's been no shortage of articles talking about Austin

2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:24.880
 and what's happening here. And I know some of Joe's plans and you and I and Blair and all

2:36:24.880 --> 2:36:28.560
 these other people that we know, buddy, Andrew Heaton moved here. He's just one of the best

2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:30.720
 people I know. It's just, I'm really, really excited.

2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:33.840
 Can I ask you some weird thing about friendship?

2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:34.560
 Of course.

2:36:34.560 --> 2:36:38.400
 Because you mentioned, Sam, he's Mr. Harris to you.

2:36:40.640 --> 2:36:42.320
 Didn't that bother you how he went after Joe?

2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:47.200
 Well, he's like, oh, in case you guys have brain damage from watching Rogan's last episode,

2:36:47.200 --> 2:36:48.720
 like, watch, here's the answer. And it's just...

2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:49.760
 Oh, like, digs like that?

2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:51.200
 Yeah, yeah, I didn't like that.

2:36:51.200 --> 2:36:55.200
 I didn't like that either. I think Sam doesn't like it either about himself.

2:36:55.200 --> 2:36:55.440
 Okay.

2:36:56.480 --> 2:36:57.680
 He regrets those things.

2:36:57.680 --> 2:37:03.760
 Because it's very easy to say from his perspective, look, this isn't the full side,

2:37:03.760 --> 2:37:06.880
 Rogan didn't show you the full side of the story. Here's the other side of the story.

2:37:06.880 --> 2:37:09.840
 Please watch this and be informed. That's a very reasonable thing to say.

2:37:09.840 --> 2:37:14.480
 Yeah, I don't quite understand this. So they do this about each other now.

2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:20.560
 I'll put three people on the table, which is Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, and Brett Weinstein.

2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:26.400
 And they have a way of talking like the other person is creating a lot of harm.

2:37:27.280 --> 2:37:32.240
 Like, publicly would say things like that. And I understand there's emotion in it.

2:37:33.520 --> 2:37:39.440
 But like, these are human beings that are friends of yours.

2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:43.440
 But I'll go the other way. Let's suppose it is true that Joe's doing a lot of harm spreading

2:37:43.440 --> 2:37:49.280
 misinformation. Being sarcastic isn't going to be persuasive. Whereas if you're like,

2:37:49.280 --> 2:37:55.040
 he's wrong, here's the facts, or here's, or be informed that to me, but then I'm not Sam Harris,

2:37:55.040 --> 2:37:58.160
 I'm not, he's got a bigger audience than me. So maybe he's the one who's right now wrong.

2:37:58.160 --> 2:37:59.920
 No, he's, well, he's just human.

2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:01.440
 Okay, well, I can relate.

2:38:02.320 --> 2:38:07.280
 Well, have you seen your Twitter lately? I mean, you get very, you have a lot of fun on Twitter.

2:38:07.280 --> 2:38:12.960
 I feel like Twitter, let's, I've never done that with someone I'm friends with. I never would.

2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:18.400
 Okay, let's put that on record. It is on record because if there's an issue with you,

2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:20.080
 I'm getting you on the phone. Yeah.

2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:24.800
 Good. I mean, then I'm not backing you into a corner publicly. It doesn't make any sense

2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:32.560
 strategically. Yeah. And actually, Brett Weinstein tweeted something sort of criticizing

2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:36.960
 something I didn't already forgot what, but he texted me first saying like, is it okay if I tweet

2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:44.000
 this? Yeah. And I said, yep, like, I was excited. Yeah. But I think there's some level of just

2:38:44.960 --> 2:38:51.680
 be compassionate privately and be compassionate publicly, like both civil. Civil. Yeah. I,

2:38:51.680 --> 2:38:57.840
 I, for some reason, I don't like the word civility because it, it's like polite. I do, like, it's,

2:38:57.840 --> 2:39:03.760
 it's a, would be cordial. Is that better? No, what I mean is like, it seems phony to you.

2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:08.560
 It seems phony. Like you should really love in whatever way. So even if you're rough with the

2:39:08.560 --> 2:39:14.720
 other person, you should still show like respect and love for that person. And that, that gets back

2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:18.640
 to the Russian rooms where they're yelling at each other, but they're still loving underneath it.

2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:26.560
 I mean, the question I want to ask for you is, I think you and I have a different view on some

2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:31.280
 things. Okay. We have a different approach to things, just on the surface level, but also a

2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:37.920
 different view on some things. Like I have a lot of hope for institutions. I, I have, so maybe it's

2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:44.720
 a gut instinct. Like your gut instinct is like centers of power are like, burn them down first

2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:51.040
 and then let's figure it out. Or maybe that's a funny rough way of saying it. And then for me,

2:39:51.040 --> 2:39:58.560
 it's like, no, let's understand the institution and slowly, um, revolutions from within versus

2:39:58.560 --> 2:40:05.040
 revolutions from without. And, um, but like we can have those disagreements and there may be times

2:40:05.040 --> 2:40:09.360
 when those disagreements will be, I could see in the future, I could see I'll be attacked

2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:15.360
 by my friend, Michael Malis, which I very look forward to it. No, not attack, but you know what

2:40:15.360 --> 2:40:20.160
 I mean on the surface level and the idea space. Anyway, because you're shaking your head now,

2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:27.680
 you won't, I guess, um, maybe this also goes to Sam Harris and Joe Rogan. I would love to be able

2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:34.880
 to disagree, disagree in big ways, unimportant things and still be close friends. And I don't

2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:39.120
 understand why those should be contradictions. Yeah. And that's the tension. That's been the

2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:47.360
 most heartbreaking thing to me about Sam and Brett and Joe. In the case of Brett, it's me,

2:40:47.360 --> 2:40:51.840
 I don't know, Brett. So I'm just like looking as a, somebody who just enjoys having these voices

2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:58.160
 out there and it seems like COVID just brought out the worst than some many folks. And it just

2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:05.840
 feels like it's so sad to me to see their friendship somewhat deteriorating, or maybe I'm just being

2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:12.000
 in a, um... No, it seems clear that it's deteriorated enormously. It's sad, but that's the case. Yeah.

2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:16.720
 So my, like I've had people come at me because I'm friends with you and they were like, Oh,

2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:19.920
 Lex authored some paper about masks. I don't even know what the hell they're referring to. I don't

2:41:19.920 --> 2:41:26.960
 care. I always say and mean, I don't care whether someone agrees with me. I care how they treat me.

2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:31.280
 And it goes the other way because I'll have a lot of people on Twitter who are like, Oh,

2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:34.160
 I'm on your team and blah, blah, blah. I'm like, I don't know you. You're not my team.

2:41:34.720 --> 2:41:39.120
 And just because you happen to agree with me, it's of no value to me. Like I don't know you and

2:41:39.120 --> 2:41:44.080
 I'm interested in knowing you. Many of my friends, I don't know their politics or I don't care. Like,

2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:48.400
 I care how we hang out. We have a good time. We watch the movies, watch YouTube, go to the

2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:51.840
 store, whatever. I don't know what your politics are. I don't care what your politics are.

2:41:53.680 --> 2:41:57.040
 Chris Williamson, who, you know, he's just here. He's going to be moving to Austin.

2:41:57.600 --> 2:42:01.520
 I only learned what his politics are in the last, we've been, we chat like almost every day

2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:05.440
 because he took the world's smallest political quiz and he figured out what his answers were.

2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:10.480
 I had no idea. He's communist. He's well, obviously. Yeah. Yeah. Marxist. Yeah. Let's be honest.

2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:19.760
 So like stuff like that, like it never, and people, I think because politics is often so

2:42:19.760 --> 2:42:24.880
 tribal, especially now, they'll be like, oh, I could never be friends with someone who voted

2:42:24.880 --> 2:42:28.960
 for X. Really? What if they're like grandma worked in that campaign? What if, you know,

2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:34.720
 you can't think of one steelman argument why this would happen, but if they just want to

2:42:34.720 --> 2:42:40.560
 spite their boss. So I don't like that approach at all. It makes no sense to me.

2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:46.400
 We could still have debates. I mean, like, I would still like to have those conversations

2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:53.200
 and still have disagreements. Like, I disagree with Joe on COVID a lot on a bunch of different

2:42:53.200 --> 2:43:01.440
 things, very kind of, but it's never like, it's not tense at all. It's just, it's, it doesn't

2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:08.320
 have that arrogance that seem a lot of COVID conversation seems to have, like talking down

2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:13.840
 to people from both directions. It's, so I would love to have those because I love the debate.

2:43:13.840 --> 2:43:19.280
 I love debates. It takes a lot to get me triggered. And when the Babylon B were interviewing Elon,

2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:23.520
 and he had this thing, he goes, well, I don't know anyone who wants to, you know,

2:43:24.160 --> 2:43:29.920
 abolish the FDA and the FAA, and I'm standing there and I'm shaking and the guys look at me,

2:43:29.920 --> 2:43:34.000
 and they're like, oh, we actually have an anarchist here. And the example he used was,

2:43:34.640 --> 2:43:38.880
 you know, look, if playing football, you're going to have a referee there. You want the referee,

2:43:38.880 --> 2:43:42.480
 you know, you don't want, but the referee started playing the game is, this is a good thing.

2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:45.600
 And I was sitting there, I'm like, the referee doesn't work for the state.

2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:51.760
 The referee is a private individual working for this organization. And there's no

2:43:51.760 --> 2:43:56.640
 reason at all that food quality, which is something crucially important,

2:43:56.640 --> 2:44:00.080
 has to be or can only be delivered through the state and a government monopoly.

2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:06.960
 That's actually really interesting. Just to link on that, just a little bit,

2:44:06.960 --> 2:44:11.680
 with the vaccine and stuff like that, with the antiviral drugs, the FDA, so like,

2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:17.600
 are you comfort, like who should be the referee? Right. Do you have an idea? Like,

2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:22.640
 what's the best referee for the vaccine? It's just the market. Just let people decide.

2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:29.360
 This is tricky because the thing that I have not been following COVID as closely as Joe and Sam,

2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:35.600
 as Mr. Harris, excuse me, and Mr. Musk, the point is, when anything like this is developing,

2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:40.240
 there's going to be a lot of misinformation out there, even from the scientists,

2:44:40.240 --> 2:44:44.160
 because it's a dynamic process. They don't know what they're dealing with. A lot of it has to be

2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:47.360
 speculative. They don't know long term effects because it hasn't been around for a long time.

2:44:47.360 --> 2:44:57.680
 So, I think it is very dangerous when Joe was mocked for taking a laundry list of

2:44:57.680 --> 2:45:03.760
 things under his doctor's advice, and they kind of latched on to the ivermectin,

2:45:03.760 --> 2:45:06.880
 and then they specifically said it was horse paced, although it's veterinary medicines,

2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:10.720
 why didn't they say dog paced or cat paced? It's like, well, he's not dead.

2:45:10.720 --> 2:45:17.600
 So, and he's also taking drugs which are used in other circumstances, the very least,

2:45:17.600 --> 2:45:22.720
 maybe they're pointless, but if the drug is being allowed for pharmaceutical reasons,

2:45:22.720 --> 2:45:27.280
 the odds are quite low that they're going to have deleterious side effects in general.

2:45:27.280 --> 2:45:36.960
 So, I think this kind of insistence that there has to be one officially approved outcome

2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:41.120
 that we're all doing, that is kind of dangerous thinking in general.

2:45:41.120 --> 2:45:45.680
 By the way, I don't know if you saw, I got a chance to talk to the Pfizer CEO,

2:45:46.480 --> 2:45:51.280
 and I had helped collecting questions because I got a lot of questions and

2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:53.600
 people put at the top a question from Michael Malis.

2:45:53.600 --> 2:45:54.080
 Oh, really?

2:45:54.640 --> 2:46:00.560
 No, the ask him what he likes best about me.

2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:02.400
 Oh, what does he like best? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:46:02.400 --> 2:46:06.320
 So, I actually had that in my list of questions I was going to ask him, and my plan was,

2:46:06.320 --> 2:46:10.720
 I'll ask him, Michael Malis wants to know what you like best about him.

2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:12.560
 And then my guess was he'd be like, who?

2:46:12.560 --> 2:46:13.840
 And I'll be like, exactly.

2:46:13.840 --> 2:46:15.120
 And then go on to the next.

2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:21.120
 But I thought like how it was such a tense conversation that I thought there would be no

2:46:21.680 --> 2:46:22.640
 question for levity.

2:46:22.640 --> 2:46:28.080
 The question I would ask him is, can you acknowledge that there is an enormous incentive

2:46:28.880 --> 2:46:35.600
 for your company to force everyone in America or everyone on earth to be a consumer of your product?

2:46:35.600 --> 2:46:37.200
 Yeah, that's my question.

2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:39.360
 So, I dance around that question quite a lot.

2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:46.000
 Like, I phrased it differently, which is a conflict of interest and attention between

2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:48.640
 making a lot of money and actually helping people.

2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:56.000
 And I mean, I've asked a lot of really heavy questions in that, and I still, and a lot of

2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:01.840
 people wrote to me with support saying like, that was a really great conversation.

2:47:01.840 --> 2:47:09.600
 And a lot of people wrote saying that, I mean, saying that it was just too soft.

2:47:10.400 --> 2:47:13.840
 And it, I don't know, I think about that a lot.

2:47:13.840 --> 2:47:15.680
 Like, how do you have that conversation?

2:47:15.680 --> 2:47:17.600
 I don't think it was too soft.

2:47:18.160 --> 2:47:23.920
 And actually just for the record, I want to say that they didn't see any of the questions I'm asking.

2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:27.280
 They didn't see the final interview.

2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:29.040
 I can ask anything I want.

2:47:29.040 --> 2:47:39.360
 And so, any questions that I asked and fail to ask is my own shortcomings.

2:47:40.640 --> 2:47:44.640
 Also, not being a coward, I was afraid of nothing.

2:47:44.640 --> 2:47:47.920
 Like, what do I have to gain or lose exactly?

2:47:47.920 --> 2:47:52.080
 Well, you have something to lose because if you're, I do only do softballs.

2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:56.880
 Because if I'm going to make it difficult for someone to come to my show,

2:47:56.880 --> 2:48:00.480
 a lot of people will be disincentivized to do the show because like, well, I don't need this.

2:48:00.480 --> 2:48:00.960
 I see.

2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:02.240
 Oh, yeah, I wasn't thinking like that.

2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:08.160
 But I was, I don't like to, what I think some fraction of folks wanted me to do is to

2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:13.040
 yell at a person, like, criticize them, not even ask questions.

2:48:13.040 --> 2:48:14.320
 Yeah, yeah, how dare you?

2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:20.560
 Yeah, but to me, my goal, my hope is with these conversations is not just to do

2:48:20.560 --> 2:48:25.120
 how great you are, all that kind of stuff, is to bring out some deeper truth.

2:48:25.120 --> 2:48:30.880
 Like, the beautiful things is when you can together realize some truth, like you mentioned,

2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:38.480
 that, you know, the incentive to, for everyone to take the vaccine is obviously high for the

2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:39.840
 maker of a vaccine.

2:48:39.840 --> 2:48:40.160
 Yeah.

2:48:40.160 --> 2:48:40.480
 Right.

2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:49.040
 And for them to arrive at that truth together, like, that is a really difficult truth to

2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:49.840
 operate under.

2:48:49.840 --> 2:48:56.480
 Like, for example, I had a whole exchange with him about, this is Jordan Peterson asked

2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:03.440
 this question, I use that as a kind of springboard, which is the kind of open doors between

2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:09.200
 the FDA, the CDC, and Pfizer, right, like some people work at Pfizer and then go to work

2:49:09.200 --> 2:49:11.360
 at the FDA and then vice versa.

2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:18.080
 And I brought up, this is my safe space, maybe yours too, just to give you a little

2:49:18.080 --> 2:49:24.560
 bit, maybe yours too, just going back to the Soviet Union to look at the lessons of human

2:49:24.560 --> 2:49:32.000
 nature and corruption and said, like, this, there's two things, this looks bad and two,

2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.800
 this naturally leads to corruption.

2:49:34.800 --> 2:49:39.040
 And I pushed this with several questions, but polite and respectful and he ultimately

2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:44.520
 said, you know, there's rules, we, there's the rule of law and there's very strict rules

2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:49.200
 about this, and we have to follow those rules, otherwise you get punished severely.

2:49:49.200 --> 2:49:53.960
 And so, like, his response is, like, people reacted to them as like, okay, that's the

2:49:53.960 --> 2:49:59.200
 CEO doing the political, but there's also truth to what he's saying, that one of the

2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:04.160
 beautiful things about America is that the, you can criticize the rule of law currently,

2:50:04.160 --> 2:50:10.680
 but it's still, it's better than in Soviet, in the Soviet Union, where people bribed

2:50:10.680 --> 2:50:19.040
 each other, and, but still, he made it seem like there's no corruption.

2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:25.120
 People often ask me why I describe myself as an anarchist and not a narco capitalist,

2:50:25.120 --> 2:50:28.860
 because they think my views are more in line with that school of anarchism.

2:50:28.860 --> 2:50:34.400
 And one of the other reasons you just gave me a good one is that if I am talking to someone

2:50:34.400 --> 2:50:41.160
 who's a major CEO, I am, I have that hardcore left anarchist view that this person is, if

2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:46.920
 not the devil, certainly going to be sinister, at the very least.

2:50:46.920 --> 2:50:52.320
 And if you can't say, listen, this happens inevitably with elites, it's, you know, it

2:50:52.320 --> 2:50:55.960
 happens in universities, it happens in the food industry, there's only so many people

2:50:55.960 --> 2:51:00.120
 at the top of these things, there's the field is small, and everyone's going to know each

2:51:00.120 --> 2:51:04.080
 other, which is kind of, you know, just the dynamics of any market, that would kind of

2:51:04.080 --> 2:51:08.640
 be more reasonable, and just say, it's easy to caricature us because you're not in the

2:51:08.640 --> 2:51:13.000
 boardroom, but we're not, you know, we are trying to produce a product that people want.

2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:20.240
 So unlike the people who criticize me, I was bothered by, I wasn't bothered by most things,

2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:26.200
 but I was bothered by the fact that he didn't show more worry about the corrupting nature

2:51:26.200 --> 2:51:27.200
 of money and power.

2:51:27.200 --> 2:51:33.840
 Like he should, if you say that there's no corruption, you should show that because we

2:51:33.840 --> 2:51:41.080
 constantly worry about it, not because like, look, there's rules, which are enforced by

2:51:41.080 --> 2:51:42.080
 you.

2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:43.080
 Yeah, exactly.

2:51:43.080 --> 2:51:51.360
 So like, I think the only way to avoid force for time, the corrupting force of power is

2:51:51.360 --> 2:51:54.600
 to freak out about it, nonstop.

2:51:54.600 --> 2:51:58.120
 The impression I always get from people like him, and I haven't seen the interview, and

2:51:58.120 --> 2:52:05.520
 I won't be watching it, is they're genuinely convinced that they're good guys, yeah.

2:52:05.520 --> 2:52:11.120
 And if you're the good guy, sure, corruption is a concern, theoretically, but I know this

2:52:11.120 --> 2:52:15.840
 guy at the FDA, I know this senator, sure we disagree, sure there's some things I don't

2:52:15.840 --> 2:52:19.760
 like, but in terms of corrupt, they're not getting briefcases full of money.

2:52:19.760 --> 2:52:24.120
 They're not going to sell a vaccine that, you know, kills people in Georgia.

2:52:24.120 --> 2:52:27.240
 So yeah, it's a concern, theoretically, but this is 21st century.

2:52:27.240 --> 2:52:29.160
 The thought process, I think, writes itself.

2:52:29.160 --> 2:52:34.960
 I think, yeah, having the humility, I do this all the time to maybe to a destructive level,

2:52:34.960 --> 2:52:38.960
 thinking that I might be doing bad for the world, I might be wrong, I might be that kind

2:52:38.960 --> 2:52:43.480
 of thinking is very, you should do at least some of that, not to a point being paralyzed,

2:52:43.480 --> 2:52:44.480
 but a little bit.

2:52:44.480 --> 2:52:49.160
 You're actually in the right mindset for me to ask you then for advice.

2:52:49.160 --> 2:52:50.160
 Okay.

2:52:50.160 --> 2:52:52.360
 You're in this compassionate, thoughtful mood.

2:52:52.360 --> 2:52:53.360
 I like it.

2:52:53.360 --> 2:52:55.040
 I like the compassionate, thoughtful Michael.

2:52:55.040 --> 2:53:03.480
 So for future conversations like that, so the person that offered a conversation that

2:53:03.480 --> 2:53:07.120
 at first I avoided, but I might return to is Anthony Fauci.

2:53:07.120 --> 2:53:12.800
 So there's Anthony Fauci, but then there's also Trump and Biden, people like that, like

2:53:12.800 --> 2:53:18.040
 if you add them on your show or just giving me advice on how to talk to them, what do

2:53:18.040 --> 2:53:22.560
 you think is the right way to talk to them?

2:53:22.560 --> 2:53:30.360
 And forget about future guests, but to get at something new together, get at something,

2:53:30.360 --> 2:53:34.440
 not for views or likes or clicks or any of that, but discover something new through the

2:53:34.440 --> 2:53:35.440
 mode of conversation.

2:53:35.440 --> 2:53:37.520
 Well, let's take those one at a time.

2:53:37.520 --> 2:53:42.000
 So if I had a talk in a Trump, I told Ruben to ask Trump this and he didn't.

2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:46.920
 What I wanted to know is, what's the look on your face when you're sending these tweets?

2:53:46.920 --> 2:53:49.240
 Because I imagine you're on the toilet with this phone.

2:53:49.240 --> 2:53:51.200
 Are you cracking yourself up?

2:53:51.200 --> 2:53:52.440
 Are you just completely stoic?

2:53:52.440 --> 2:53:55.240
 Are you kind of that Trump little smirky does?

2:53:55.240 --> 2:54:01.200
 So when you get someone to open up about their emotion, about some of their passion about,

2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:06.040
 I think that breaks down some barriers and creates a bond, yeah.

2:54:06.040 --> 2:54:10.160
 But Ruben wouldn't be, that's not his style, like that's a great question for you to ask.

2:54:10.160 --> 2:54:13.680
 Well, I told him to say Michael Malasette.

2:54:13.680 --> 2:54:19.840
 For Biden, that would be a tough one because Biden gets, doesn't get enough credit for

2:54:19.840 --> 2:54:21.840
 what a good politician he is.

2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:27.440
 There was this moment people can see on YouTube where Biden is addressing a room full of people

2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:32.960
 and he had someone there and he goes, why don't you stand up so everyone can give you

2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:33.960
 a hand?

2:54:33.960 --> 2:54:38.840
 And the guy was in a wheelchair and Biden's like, oh, and like, but instantly he goes,

2:54:38.840 --> 2:54:41.240
 you know what, we're all going to stand up for you.

2:54:41.240 --> 2:54:43.240
 And he made everyone get up and applaud the guy.

2:54:43.240 --> 2:54:44.240
 I'm like, that's quick.

2:54:44.240 --> 2:54:45.240
 Yeah.

2:54:45.240 --> 2:54:46.240
 Like, yeah, you made a fool of yourself.

2:54:46.240 --> 2:54:48.080
 So he is a glad hander.

2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:50.400
 In many ways, he's more of a schmoozer than Trump was.

2:54:50.400 --> 2:54:54.120
 Like Trump made the point that he knows all the good people, but Biden knows how to shake

2:54:54.120 --> 2:54:55.120
 hands.

2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:58.400
 Well, I think with both, I'm sorry to interrupt, with both Trump and Biden, like you mentioned

2:54:58.400 --> 2:55:02.240
 earlier, to me, at least their family is fascinating.

2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:06.800
 The dynamic, as a family man, as a father, as a, I think that Biden won't acknowledge

2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:10.960
 his illegitimate grandkid is a problem for me.

2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:14.080
 But at the same time, I can see why he thinks it's off limits to ask, because that's the

2:55:14.080 --> 2:55:17.800
 thing when you're dealing with people that powerful, they're not used to having to answer

2:55:17.800 --> 2:55:22.400
 questions, which might be perfectly nice, but would cause them to freak the hell out.

2:55:22.400 --> 2:55:26.840
 That's the tricky thing of talking to people, as you know, like some, some topics are off

2:55:26.840 --> 2:55:31.080
 limit, not in that they draw lines, but they just shut down.

2:55:31.080 --> 2:55:32.080
 Yeah.

2:55:32.080 --> 2:55:37.480
 When you ask them, trust me, I think I talked to Elon three times now, you better believe

2:55:37.480 --> 2:55:38.800
 I brought up love.

2:55:38.800 --> 2:55:41.440
 And how far do you think that got?

2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:42.440
 You could just imagine.

2:55:42.440 --> 2:55:43.440
 Zero.

2:55:43.440 --> 2:55:44.440
 That's one.

2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:47.280
 We, we did, we did exactly the kind of robot back and forth.

2:55:47.280 --> 2:55:48.280
 Yeah.

2:55:48.280 --> 2:55:49.520
 We just like just shut down.

2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:52.760
 So yeah, I, I worry about that with personal, but those, that's the thing that makes it

2:55:52.760 --> 2:55:59.720
 fascinating with those two, because he had, um, but with Hunter and losing his son, like

2:55:59.720 --> 2:56:07.200
 the dynamic of the complexities of all that, like just having, um, you know, children fuck

2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:09.120
 up in the way children do.

2:56:09.120 --> 2:56:14.480
 And then with Trump, the interesting dynamic with his very different kids and all kind

2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:19.560
 of interesting in different ways and maintaining connection with all of them and also letting

2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:21.840
 them flourish individually is fascinating to me.

2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:24.920
 Well, I'd also want to ask Trump if he can name all the presidents in order, which there's

2:56:24.920 --> 2:56:25.920
 no, he can.

2:56:25.920 --> 2:56:26.920
 Yeah.

2:56:26.920 --> 2:56:28.200
 But I'd also want to know all the prep.

2:56:28.200 --> 2:56:31.520
 Do you think he knows who the second president of the United States is?

2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:32.520
 Yes.

2:56:32.520 --> 2:56:33.520
 Okay.

2:56:33.520 --> 2:56:34.520
 John Adams, he knows.

2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:39.240
 I think when it gets between Ulysses S. Grant and McKinley, that's when we all screw up

2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:40.240
 that window.

2:56:40.240 --> 2:56:41.240
 It's tough.

2:56:41.240 --> 2:56:42.240
 Yeah.

2:56:42.240 --> 2:56:43.240
 Yeah.

2:56:43.240 --> 2:56:47.040
 I mean, he, he's not, he's going to be able to get back to FDR.

2:56:47.040 --> 2:56:48.040
 No question.

2:56:48.040 --> 2:56:55.000
 I have to, my sense was with Donald Trump, and this is not, I would say criticism is

2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:59.160
 he doesn't have a depth of knowledge or more importantly, curiosity about history.

2:56:59.160 --> 2:57:00.160
 Yeah.

2:57:00.160 --> 2:57:05.800
 But if you're old enough, you're going to at least remember the presidents in your lifetime.

2:57:05.800 --> 2:57:06.800
 In your lifetime.

2:57:06.800 --> 2:57:07.800
 Yeah.

2:57:07.800 --> 2:57:08.800
 So that's what I'm saying.

2:57:08.800 --> 2:57:09.800
 You'll get a president to FDR pretty easily.

2:57:09.800 --> 2:57:10.800
 Yeah.

2:57:10.800 --> 2:57:11.800
 Yeah.

2:57:11.800 --> 2:57:12.800
 Okay.

2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:13.800
 Yeah.

2:57:13.800 --> 2:57:14.800
 You went FDR from the other direction.

2:57:14.800 --> 2:57:15.800
 No, no.

2:57:15.800 --> 2:57:16.800
 Yeah.

2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:17.800
 Yeah.

2:57:17.800 --> 2:57:18.800
 Yeah.

2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:22.800
 But yeah, from a political perspective, like having a conversation about politics with

2:57:22.800 --> 2:57:32.080
 those two, there is interesting topics, interaction between Donald Trump and Putin,

2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:38.560
 not the interaction, like not the stupid journalistic stuff, but it's clear to me that he is a student

2:57:38.560 --> 2:57:39.560
 of power.

2:57:39.560 --> 2:57:40.880
 Oh, for sure.

2:57:40.880 --> 2:57:43.600
 And like he enjoys the game of power.

2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:44.600
 Yeah.

2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:49.120
 And so it's interesting because to me, the reason he admires Putin is it's another player

2:57:49.120 --> 2:57:50.600
 in the game of power.

2:57:50.600 --> 2:57:56.120
 And I think why so many people hate him, Trump, is that he demonstrated to a lot of Americans

2:57:56.120 --> 2:58:01.360
 how much of a con job most of politics is and how people just say what they need to do.

2:58:01.360 --> 2:58:04.960
 But behind closed doors, these people are buffoons and he exposed them as that.

2:58:04.960 --> 2:58:11.920
 I think Biden would be a tougher interview than Trump because I feel like Biden is more

2:58:11.920 --> 2:58:13.040
 slippery in many ways.

2:58:13.040 --> 2:58:15.400
 He's much more of a consummate politician.

2:58:15.400 --> 2:58:21.240
 He's been in the Senate since the early 70s, since he was like 30 or 35, whatever it was.

2:58:21.240 --> 2:58:25.240
 So he'd have his little kind of pat answers.

2:58:25.240 --> 2:58:30.160
 There was Larry King, who was certainly a softball interviewer, and I don't begrudge

2:58:30.160 --> 2:58:31.160
 him that at all.

2:58:31.160 --> 2:58:34.920
 He was very, very vividly and it was like, I think it was the 2008 cycle.

2:58:34.920 --> 2:58:37.280
 He asked Hillary, why do so many people hate you?

2:58:37.280 --> 2:58:38.960
 Why do you think so many people hate you?

2:58:38.960 --> 2:58:43.000
 And she just goes like, oh, well, I take tough stances and he cut her off.

2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:44.680
 He goes, other people have taken those stances.

2:58:44.680 --> 2:58:45.880
 Why they hate you?

2:58:45.880 --> 2:58:50.760
 And she didn't really, I was really impressed with him that he didn't let her off the hook.

2:58:50.760 --> 2:58:51.920
 That to me is great.

2:58:51.920 --> 2:58:57.280
 But some people say that's still too softball because you, like they would want him to start

2:58:57.280 --> 2:59:03.920
 listing, I don't know, droning like all the, all the things that Hillary Clinton has criticized

2:59:03.920 --> 2:59:04.920
 for.

2:59:04.920 --> 2:59:06.160
 Yeah, but then what she, she's done this many times.

2:59:06.160 --> 2:59:07.160
 She's very good at this.

2:59:07.160 --> 2:59:09.360
 She'll be like, look, I've addressed all these in the past.

2:59:09.360 --> 2:59:13.200
 If you want to start rehashing Republican talking points, you can go look up my interviews.

2:59:13.200 --> 2:59:14.960
 Yeah, I think it's kind of productive.

2:59:14.960 --> 2:59:19.720
 So what about more prescient for me?

2:59:19.720 --> 2:59:23.120
 I can't believe I'm walking through this fire for no good reason whatsoever, but Anthony

2:59:23.120 --> 2:59:24.120
 Fauci.

2:59:24.120 --> 2:59:30.160
 Yeah, let me tell you why I care about Anthony Fauci because I care a lot about science in

2:59:30.160 --> 2:59:32.800
 the way science is viewed in society.

2:59:32.800 --> 2:59:40.680
 And not to put it at the, at the feet of this one person, but I, him and certain members

2:59:40.680 --> 2:59:47.240
 of the scientific community that was responsible for managing the response to COVID, I think

2:59:47.240 --> 2:59:54.440
 are somewhat or entirely responsible for a significant decrease in trust in science.

2:59:54.440 --> 2:59:55.440
 Yes, no question.

2:59:55.440 --> 2:59:56.440
 In the past couple of years.

2:59:56.440 --> 3:00:00.160
 There was a poll that just came out this week that said the number is just collapsed.

3:00:00.160 --> 3:00:10.320
 And if you don't blame him for it, I personally is blame him for not improving the problem.

3:00:10.320 --> 3:00:15.120
 And so there's definitely would be a harsh conversation there to be had.

3:00:15.120 --> 3:00:19.320
 And I think I want to have it, but how do you do it?

3:00:19.320 --> 3:00:20.320
 It's tough.

3:00:20.320 --> 3:00:21.320
 Yeah.

3:00:21.320 --> 3:00:25.560
 Because, you know, again, politicians, this political answers, if they get too frustrated

3:00:25.560 --> 3:00:29.440
 too quickly, they will not explore these difficult things with you.

3:00:29.440 --> 3:00:32.200
 They'll just shut down.

3:00:32.200 --> 3:00:36.920
 But then if you say too many nice things, because I should also say Anthony Fauci is

3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:43.040
 an incredible career, like there's several hours worth of conversation to be had about

3:00:43.040 --> 3:00:44.720
 how amazing of a person he is.

3:00:44.720 --> 3:00:48.120
 Well, I would also be curious about the AIDS stuff, because that's something it's criticized

3:00:48.120 --> 3:00:49.120
 about.

3:00:49.120 --> 3:00:50.120
 And I wouldn't come out aggressively.

3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:51.120
 I would say, let's set the record straight.

3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:53.920
 This is some of the criticism you get, blah, blah, blah.

3:00:53.920 --> 3:00:55.720
 You roll in the AIDS crisis.

3:00:55.720 --> 3:00:56.720
 Let's talk about this.

3:00:56.720 --> 3:00:59.040
 And this is something that is important part of American history.

3:00:59.040 --> 3:01:02.640
 There was a pandemic, but it was localized to certain populations.

3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:06.760
 And that population at the first, at least, was pretty much told goodbye and good luck.

3:01:06.760 --> 3:01:08.200
 You're going to have to deal with this.

3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:09.600
 So how did you deal with that?

3:01:09.600 --> 3:01:12.600
 I mean, were you scared of getting AIDS, you know, so on and so forth?

3:01:12.600 --> 3:01:18.240
 But also there was that comment when, and correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not a Fauci expert,

3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:23.280
 when he basically they told people not to wear masks or they lied about it to some extent,

3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:25.880
 because they said then people are going to run out of them or something like that.

3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:28.040
 And they admitted they were being inaccurate.

3:01:28.040 --> 3:01:29.640
 I would nail him on that.

3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:30.640
 I'm like, let's address this.

3:01:30.640 --> 3:01:32.200
 Were you being dishonest?

3:01:32.200 --> 3:01:35.720
 Is there sometimes when it's important to be dishonest in service of whatever?

3:01:35.720 --> 3:01:40.520
 Also I would ask him how as someone who's not a politician, whether his level of fame

3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:42.760
 and adulation has gotten to his head.

3:01:42.760 --> 3:01:47.440
 How do you have a perspective when and how does it feel when a sitting senator tells

3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:48.880
 you that you should be imprisoned?

3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:53.080
 Do you think Ted Cruz means it or do you think Ted Cruz is just playing to his base?

3:01:53.080 --> 3:01:56.040
 Yeah, I like the fame one.

3:01:56.040 --> 3:01:58.080
 I would love to sneak up.

3:01:58.080 --> 3:02:00.000
 I mean, that's got question applies to you too.

3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:02.000
 The question applies to me.

3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:07.840
 When you start getting more fame or money or power, are you aware of how that changed

3:02:07.840 --> 3:02:10.960
 you and explore that?

3:02:10.960 --> 3:02:13.920
 How has that changed you?

3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:20.840
 In the privacy of your mind, Michael Malis, how did you change now that you've gotten

3:02:20.840 --> 3:02:22.600
 more attention, let's say?

3:02:22.600 --> 3:02:25.280
 Or even the success of the book?

3:02:25.280 --> 3:02:31.960
 Take yourself back to the, you talk about the early 20s, the mid 20s person.

3:02:31.960 --> 3:02:33.360
 How are you different from that person?

3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:36.080
 Are you the same person or are you totally different?

3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:41.080
 What's an interesting thought is Putin the same person in 2020 as he was in 2010 and

3:02:41.080 --> 3:02:45.520
 then in 2000?

3:02:45.520 --> 3:02:49.200
 It's a non trivial, almost like.

3:02:49.200 --> 3:02:52.720
 And then the other thing with Fauci is this is the dynamic system.

3:02:52.720 --> 3:02:56.400
 Like on the one hand, he's going to want to say we got it right every time, right?

3:02:56.400 --> 3:03:02.040
 But then how is that even possible when you're dealing with an evolving, unknown dynamic situation?

3:03:02.040 --> 3:03:03.360
 When did you guys get it wrong?

3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:06.160
 That result in lives lost, do you feel guilty about that?

3:03:06.160 --> 3:03:11.000
 I mean, the big problem with the masks, the changing of mind on the mask is the arrogance

3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:12.000
 in how it was communicated.

3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:13.000
 Right.

3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:17.200
 To me, a lot of this boils down to how things are communicated.

3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:21.320
 It's like, it's obvious that you need to change your mind when you get new information.

3:03:21.320 --> 3:03:26.200
 Or sometimes, yeah, you take policies that are like, we know the truth, but we're going

3:03:26.200 --> 3:03:31.280
 to lie for a particular reason, like you have good intentions, but if you're not able to

3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:34.000
 communicate that later, like we made a mistake.

3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:42.520
 Or even ask him, can you understand how a rational person might choose not to get vaccinated?

3:03:42.520 --> 3:03:43.520
 Yes.

3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:44.520
 Yes.

3:03:44.520 --> 3:03:45.520
 Yes.

3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:48.800
 And if he can't steal man that, then that's the situation.

3:03:48.800 --> 3:03:49.800
 That's a good test.

3:03:49.800 --> 3:03:53.320
 And I've tried, and some people succeed and some people fail is the ability to really

3:03:53.320 --> 3:03:57.840
 steal man the other understand that somebody should would be hesitant about taking the

3:03:57.840 --> 3:03:58.840
 vaccine.

3:03:58.840 --> 3:03:59.840
 Yeah.

3:03:59.840 --> 3:04:03.320
 It's a giant mess, man.

3:04:03.320 --> 3:04:08.400
 This podcasting, it's just a fun little conversation, but it also has a responsibility.

3:04:08.400 --> 3:04:09.400
 I don't know.

3:04:09.400 --> 3:04:12.120
 I don't know how Joe does it.

3:04:12.120 --> 3:04:15.280
 I don't think Joe cares as much as you do.

3:04:15.280 --> 3:04:18.520
 It's more fun for him in a sense, and he's less concerned about the, I mean, he's not

3:04:18.520 --> 3:04:21.840
 unconcerned with the cultural impact, but for him, it's just more growing out.

3:04:21.840 --> 3:04:22.840
 Yeah.

3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:23.840
 Like he doesn't do as much prep.

3:04:23.840 --> 3:04:27.120
 He doesn't come in with three pages of single space to, you know, questions.

3:04:27.120 --> 3:04:28.120
 Yeah.

3:04:28.120 --> 3:04:33.600
 And that's why he's talking to Blair White for 10 minutes about whether sharks lay eggs

3:04:33.600 --> 3:04:35.000
 without knowing.

3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:38.280
 You're the one triggered person.

3:04:38.280 --> 3:04:39.840
 Maybe he trolled the troll.

3:04:39.840 --> 3:04:40.840
 Well, it worked.

3:04:40.840 --> 3:04:41.840
 Yeah, he did.

3:04:41.840 --> 3:04:44.360
 The sharks lay eggs.

3:04:44.360 --> 3:04:51.440
 I'd like to get an updated 2021 version of Michael Malis giving advice to young people.

3:04:51.440 --> 3:04:52.680
 Okay.

3:04:52.680 --> 3:05:02.240
 So there's, God forbid, high school students, college students listening to you and looking

3:05:02.240 --> 3:05:03.240
 to you for advice.

3:05:03.240 --> 3:05:09.560
 What advice would you give them about career and about life, how to live a life that you

3:05:09.560 --> 3:05:10.560
 can be proud of?

3:05:10.560 --> 3:05:14.120
 This happens a lot because I have my locals community, malis.locals.com, and there's a

3:05:14.120 --> 3:05:15.720
 lot of young people in there.

3:05:15.720 --> 3:05:17.120
 So that's a great place.

3:05:17.120 --> 3:05:19.320
 I'll give them a meta piece of advice.

3:05:19.320 --> 3:05:23.720
 Don't ask your friends for advice because you're an idiot at your age and they're all

3:05:23.720 --> 3:05:27.000
 idiots and they don't want to seem like idiots, so they're just going to give you advice they

3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:30.400
 pulled from the TV and no one knows what you're talking about and it's just going to be counter

3:05:30.400 --> 3:05:31.400
 intuitive.

3:05:31.400 --> 3:05:32.400
 Yeah.

3:05:32.400 --> 3:05:38.760
 So seek out advice from people who you seek to emulate and ask them for advice.

3:05:38.760 --> 3:05:42.120
 If you can't get a hold of them, figure out a way to get a hold of them, incentivize them

3:05:42.120 --> 3:05:43.120
 in some way.

3:05:43.120 --> 3:05:48.040
 You'd be surprised how many people are responsive on Twitter or in social media if you just ask

3:05:48.040 --> 3:05:52.420
 them a basic life question because then they can quote, tweet, and answer to a whole population.

3:05:52.420 --> 3:05:54.880
 So that would be one mechanism.

3:05:54.880 --> 3:06:01.040
 It's also very hard at that age to realize your parents might not be all that bright and

3:06:01.040 --> 3:06:03.800
 they might not be all that good people.

3:06:03.800 --> 3:06:07.960
 So that's a hard one at that age to kind of wrap your head around just because they love

3:06:07.960 --> 3:06:11.040
 you doesn't mean they understand you and that's okay.

3:06:11.040 --> 3:06:12.040
 That's okay.

3:06:12.040 --> 3:06:13.040
 We like everybody.

3:06:13.040 --> 3:06:15.640
 Shit, your Trump is pretty good too.

3:06:15.640 --> 3:06:20.640
 I'd like your Trump to talk to Elon to have a conversation.

3:06:20.640 --> 3:06:28.400
 Well, Mr. President, you know, look, some things you did like some, not so much, but

3:06:28.400 --> 3:06:33.000
 you know, for the most part, I think they're kind of a good thing.

3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:36.280
 What are you talking about?

3:06:36.280 --> 3:06:40.920
 Hey guys, what are we talking about?

3:06:40.920 --> 3:06:42.480
 No, I fucked up the legs.

3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:47.280
 Anyway, so that those would be two pieces, the other piece of advice I would say is join

3:06:47.280 --> 3:06:56.760
 a gym or have some kind of quantifiable daily improvement to keep you sane.

3:06:56.760 --> 3:07:02.480
 So the reason I always say weightlifting and it could be running, it could be jump rope,

3:07:02.480 --> 3:07:07.080
 I don't care what it is, because if you have those numbers moving in the positive direction,

3:07:07.080 --> 3:07:11.360
 psychologically, if you're dealing with depression or anxiety, it's concrete proof to shut your

3:07:11.360 --> 3:07:16.000
 brain up because your brain knows how to talk to you.

3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:19.960
 Your brain is off on your enemy and I'll say exactly the right thing to undermine you.

3:07:19.960 --> 3:07:22.480
 So that's an issue.

3:07:22.480 --> 3:07:26.440
 Be I just, this works for me, maybe it weren't for most people.

3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:29.400
 I'm very high on the openness metric.

3:07:29.400 --> 3:07:33.040
 Try new experiences, new things, try things you don't like.

3:07:33.040 --> 3:07:34.400
 It's okay to have a bad experience.

3:07:34.400 --> 3:07:35.680
 You've learned something.

3:07:35.680 --> 3:07:40.480
 So go to a restaurant of a cuisine you wouldn't like or hadn't heard of, read a book that's

3:07:40.480 --> 3:07:43.720
 popular but you have no interest in.

3:07:43.720 --> 3:07:44.720
 Read a lot.

3:07:44.720 --> 3:07:48.840
 For example, I didn't know anything about the election, what was it, 1892 when there

3:07:48.840 --> 3:07:50.840
 was like a split between the electors.

3:07:50.840 --> 3:07:51.840
 Read a book about it.

3:07:51.840 --> 3:07:52.840
 Oh, I didn't know anything.

3:07:52.840 --> 3:07:54.520
 You know, I don't know anything really about Malcolm X.

3:07:54.520 --> 3:07:55.960
 Read a book about him.

3:07:55.960 --> 3:07:59.640
 You'll be amazed how much more full you become as a person.

3:07:59.640 --> 3:08:03.720
 Do you see value in writing also, like writing down your ideas?

3:08:03.720 --> 3:08:05.920
 No, I think there's very little value in that.

3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:06.920
 I'm not joking.

3:08:06.920 --> 3:08:08.120
 So reading is where the biggest big possible.

3:08:08.120 --> 3:08:10.720
 Yeah, because you're probably not going to revisit what you've written down.

3:08:10.720 --> 3:08:16.240
 But the act of writing, you don't see, it solidifies somehow thoughts in your mind.

3:08:16.240 --> 3:08:17.240
 Not for me.

3:08:17.240 --> 3:08:18.240
 No, it doesn't for you.

3:08:18.240 --> 3:08:22.200
 Like a tweet will, because then I have to have it narrowed down into like a phrase.

3:08:22.200 --> 3:08:24.880
 Oh, the responsibility of there being an audience.

3:08:24.880 --> 3:08:29.640
 No, I just meant in terms of I've got 280 characters, so instead of having a reandering

3:08:29.640 --> 3:08:33.480
 thought, I have to codify it in something that's catchy and short.

3:08:33.480 --> 3:08:35.520
 That's a good, useful mental exercise.

3:08:35.520 --> 3:08:37.960
 What face do you make when you tweet?

3:08:37.960 --> 3:08:39.720
 I wouldn't know.

3:08:39.720 --> 3:08:40.720
 I don't know.

3:08:40.720 --> 3:08:41.720
 That's a good point.

3:08:41.720 --> 3:08:42.800
 Is it on the toilet?

3:08:42.800 --> 3:08:45.040
 How much, what percentage is on the toilet?

3:08:45.040 --> 3:08:46.040
 Very little.

3:08:46.040 --> 3:08:48.520
 On the toilets, I usually more reading.

3:08:48.520 --> 3:08:55.040
 So even though my tweets are all literally shit, there are a few of them are on the toilet.

3:08:55.040 --> 3:08:58.560
 That's some advice.

3:08:58.560 --> 3:09:02.120
 Don't compare yourself to other people.

3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:04.520
 That's a really dangerous one.

3:09:04.520 --> 3:09:05.920
 All my friends are married.

3:09:05.920 --> 3:09:12.160
 I should have a kid by now, should, there's an expression in recovery, stop shooting yourself.

3:09:12.160 --> 3:09:16.720
 But it's, should, should, should, it's stupid.

3:09:16.720 --> 3:09:22.960
 I also, and this could be my hoarder brain, I surround my house with talismans of joy.

3:09:22.960 --> 3:09:28.920
 So if you have an accomplishment, like when I did Rogan once, I bought with the sock store

3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:31.800
 and I bought these orange socks with black cherries on them.

3:09:31.800 --> 3:09:35.000
 And now whenever I wore that socks, those socks, I'm like, oh, this is because I was

3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:36.000
 on Rogan.

3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:37.000
 That was kind of a big deal.

3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:41.440
 So if you have these little things throughout your house, it's, it was good mental fuel.

3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:42.440
 Even like, like a toy.

3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:43.440
 Remember when I was a kid?

3:09:43.440 --> 3:09:44.440
 Oh, you know what?

3:09:44.440 --> 3:09:49.760
 This little moments that inspire happiness, I think are visually very useful.

3:09:49.760 --> 3:09:53.480
 So that's another one.

3:09:53.480 --> 3:10:02.040
 And I, by the way, have the, that the watch and that, because we're talking about 2021,

3:10:02.040 --> 3:10:09.720
 I was really, the guy in the lecture hall giving a pat in the back, Joe gave me the,

3:10:09.720 --> 3:10:14.600
 the watch was, it has life changing for me.

3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:15.600
 Yeah.

3:10:15.600 --> 3:10:16.600
 Yeah.

3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:17.600
 Yeah.

3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:19.920
 It doesn't even, it didn't, the fact that it was on a podcast or whatever, doesn't matter.

3:10:19.920 --> 3:10:23.720
 Learn how to form boundaries.

3:10:23.720 --> 3:10:26.520
 That's probably the biggest, that's going to be number one on my list.

3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:27.520
 Can you explain?

3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:30.040
 Because you're going to have people around you who feel the need that they're entitled

3:10:30.040 --> 3:10:34.680
 to your time, who feel the need to criticize you and they're not coming from a good place.

3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:37.600
 So it's very good for you to be like, I'm not interested in talking about this anymore

3:10:37.600 --> 3:10:38.600
 right now.

3:10:38.600 --> 3:10:39.600
 Yeah.

3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:40.600
 Even if it's your parents.

3:10:40.600 --> 3:10:41.600
 Even if it's your, especially if it's your parents.

3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:45.400
 Like I need my space right now, you're entitled to your space, you're entitled to your time.

3:10:45.400 --> 3:10:47.800
 No one owes you, you don't owe anyone a response.

3:10:47.800 --> 3:10:50.720
 If someone has a question, you owe them an answer, especially if they're not coming

3:10:50.720 --> 3:10:53.680
 at you in good faith or they're coming in hostile way.

3:10:53.680 --> 3:10:54.680
 That's a big one.

3:10:54.680 --> 3:11:06.400
 It's hard to learn at that age and be valuable to those who are around you.

3:11:06.400 --> 3:11:12.280
 Be someone who people are happy to see and if things are bad, like you're the one that

3:11:12.280 --> 3:11:14.120
 they can rely on.

3:11:14.120 --> 3:11:18.040
 Like I was just a little bit under the weather and I thought to myself, you know what, if

3:11:18.040 --> 3:11:22.960
 things got really bad, I'll call Blair and she would take care of me and that kind of

3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:25.360
 was very reassuring.

3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:32.880
 And you can always call me if you have your stuff lifted in an urgent matter.

3:11:32.880 --> 3:11:33.880
 Because of the robots?

3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:34.880
 No, just me.

3:11:34.880 --> 3:11:38.640
 It's just kind of like, that's those things that can help with or you're actually literally

3:11:38.640 --> 3:11:39.640
 bleeding.

3:11:39.640 --> 3:11:40.640
 Not a good caretaker.

3:11:40.640 --> 3:11:41.640
 I can save you though.

3:11:41.640 --> 3:11:42.640
 I can murder.

3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:43.640
 If you need somebody murdered.

3:11:43.640 --> 3:11:44.640
 Yeah.

3:11:44.640 --> 3:11:45.640
 Yeah.

3:11:45.640 --> 3:11:46.640
 Yeah.

3:11:46.640 --> 3:11:52.240
 Wait, what advice would you have to kids that age?

3:11:52.240 --> 3:11:54.520
 You're a lot younger than you think you are.

3:11:54.520 --> 3:11:55.520
 That's the other one.

3:11:55.520 --> 3:11:56.520
 Yeah.

3:11:56.520 --> 3:11:57.520
 There's time.

3:11:57.520 --> 3:11:58.520
 I know.

3:11:58.520 --> 3:12:03.240
 It's impossible to understand when you're 26 that your 40s are better than your 30s because

3:12:03.240 --> 3:12:05.440
 like, okay, old man, that's all cope.

3:12:05.440 --> 3:12:07.400
 I promise you it is.

3:12:07.400 --> 3:12:08.400
 Yeah.

3:12:08.400 --> 3:12:11.480
 I think he said so many beautiful things.

3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:19.200
 I would say another version of the openness, I'll say take big risks when you're young.

3:12:19.200 --> 3:12:20.200
 Yeah.

3:12:20.200 --> 3:12:23.080
 If you fail, who cares, you're sleeping in a soup, it's not in a food town, who cares.

3:12:23.080 --> 3:12:24.480
 And take them often.

3:12:24.480 --> 3:12:25.480
 Yeah.

3:12:25.480 --> 3:12:34.640
 Also, this is more a little personal to me, I get pushed back on this, but I think take

3:12:34.640 --> 3:12:40.040
 big risks and work really hard, like at whatever you do.

3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:43.440
 Like, I think you just have to give yourself to a thing.

3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:46.800
 It doesn't have to be in terms of time, but really give everything.

3:12:46.800 --> 3:12:53.040
 So it's not like I'm going to try doing this, I'll try, I'll try.

3:12:53.040 --> 3:12:59.240
 Try with all of your heart, like really commit yourself.

3:12:59.240 --> 3:13:04.200
 That doesn't mean necessarily hours, that doesn't mean, but like if you fail at doing

3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:08.200
 a thing that you commit to, it should hurt.

3:13:08.200 --> 3:13:12.880
 So like when I competed in Jiu Jitsu or you do like sports and so on, don't just say I'm

3:13:12.880 --> 3:13:18.600
 going to have fun out there and so on, no, try to win because then if you don't, it hurts

3:13:18.600 --> 3:13:20.200
 and you learn from that.

3:13:20.200 --> 3:13:25.000
 And then throughout, I think this is the goodness thing, is be kind.

3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:28.760
 It's like, some of it is also skill, allowing yourself to be kind.

3:13:28.760 --> 3:13:33.000
 I found myself earlier in life, I still do this.

3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:37.680
 I find like when I hang out with people, people are often like cynical and negative.

3:13:37.680 --> 3:13:42.000
 And yeah, I try to avoid those people, no, but like they have, I think everybody falls

3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:46.600
 into that and sometimes it's the party norm thing.

3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:51.000
 There's a temptation to me to kind of fit in by being more negative than I'm comfortable

3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:58.680
 being and so resist the pressure, I think especially when you're younger, it's not cool

3:13:58.680 --> 3:13:59.680
 to care.

3:13:59.680 --> 3:14:06.400
 The thing that drives, when you're young, if you are a fan of a band, a writer, a podcast

3:14:06.400 --> 3:14:11.360
 or an actor and people roll their eyes at you, watch out, those people are dangerous.

3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:17.160
 You should have, if you love Avril Lavigne with her terrible music and she gives you

3:14:17.160 --> 3:14:20.600
 joy and people crap on you, they're wrong and you're right.

3:14:20.600 --> 3:14:25.520
 So hold on to those things that make you happy and if people wanna take that away from you

3:14:25.520 --> 3:14:30.440
 or how could you like that, those people are not your friends.

3:14:30.440 --> 3:14:35.920
 Why do you have to go make life so complicated?

3:14:35.920 --> 3:14:44.200
 She's my favorite musician of all time, Jim Hendrick's second ever living first.

3:14:44.200 --> 3:14:46.600
 Thank you for almost bringing a deer to my eye.

3:14:46.600 --> 3:14:51.680
 You mentioned the should ofs in terms of love and you should have kids by now.

3:14:51.680 --> 3:14:56.760
 I apologize if it's a personal one, but I think at least I have this thought and not

3:14:56.760 --> 3:15:01.560
 from society, but from myself, like I wanna get married, I wanna have kids.

3:15:01.560 --> 3:15:03.480
 Do you feel the pressure of that?

3:15:03.480 --> 3:15:04.480
 Do you wanna have kids?

3:15:04.480 --> 3:15:10.960
 I just don't wanna have kids and I do wanna get married.

3:15:10.960 --> 3:15:17.320
 This was an issue that I had to kind of work out earlier this year in terms of the possibility

3:15:17.320 --> 3:15:22.760
 of having kids because I was in a relationship with someone who would have been in many ways

3:15:22.760 --> 3:15:25.600
 literally a perfect mom.

3:15:25.600 --> 3:15:31.560
 So I did my due diligence and I actually sat down with friends of mine who had kids and

3:15:31.560 --> 3:15:34.600
 I say, give me the downside.

3:15:34.600 --> 3:15:35.840
 You did the pros and the cons.

3:15:35.840 --> 3:15:39.520
 Well, the pros I knew, the pros for kids are very, I love kids.

3:15:39.520 --> 3:15:43.920
 I was just with Frank Fleming, he writes for the Babylon Bee and he had his four kids and

3:15:43.920 --> 3:15:50.680
 his youngest son has Down syndrome, was just adorable, Winchester was so cute.

3:15:50.680 --> 3:15:56.360
 And I always get along with kids very, like I remember very vividly what it was like to

3:15:56.360 --> 3:16:01.680
 be a kid, especially a precocious kid and I remember how much it bothered me when my

3:16:01.680 --> 3:16:04.600
 parents friends wouldn't give me attention.

3:16:04.600 --> 3:16:09.000
 So I always make it a point to acknowledge kids, to talk to them and they're very grateful

3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:14.160
 and it's just really fun, especially the people who I'm friends with, their kids are probably

3:16:14.160 --> 3:16:15.160
 gonna be pretty cool.

3:16:15.160 --> 3:16:20.200
 They're not gonna be annoying and kind of ugly and overweight.

3:16:20.200 --> 3:16:23.320
 So I love you got that in there.

3:16:23.320 --> 3:16:24.320
 Okay, good.

3:16:24.320 --> 3:16:25.320
 Yeah, sorry.

3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:31.000
 But the cons, the negatives, what was the conversation like about that?

3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:36.680
 Well, my sister has two kids, my nephews who I absolutely adore, whatever their names are.

3:16:36.680 --> 3:16:44.160
 And she was saying certain things, it's like if I had kids, my kids are in my top priority.

3:16:44.160 --> 3:16:46.000
 Like it's not even a question.

3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:52.440
 And I feel like the work I'm doing, and this sounds pompous but it's true, is A, valuable

3:16:52.440 --> 3:16:55.640
 and important but I'm also the only one doing it.

3:16:55.640 --> 3:17:04.440
 So this is a big cost and so it's like it would be a major lifestyle readjustment.

3:17:04.440 --> 3:17:10.000
 And I'm at the point where I'm kind of selfish enough that I wouldn't want to do that and

3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:12.360
 also it would have to do with the right woman.

3:17:12.360 --> 3:17:17.480
 You're making a commitment and since they're all crazy, you have to find one where you

3:17:17.480 --> 3:17:19.680
 can handle the crazy.

3:17:19.680 --> 3:17:20.680
 All women are crazy?

3:17:20.680 --> 3:17:21.680
 Yeah.

3:17:21.680 --> 3:17:24.040
 They're one and a half's in a binary world.

3:17:24.040 --> 3:17:25.040
 Oh boy.

3:17:25.040 --> 3:17:26.040
 Yeah.

3:17:26.040 --> 3:17:27.040
 It's not comfortable for me.

3:17:27.040 --> 3:17:28.040
 Yes, sir.

3:17:28.040 --> 3:17:32.680
 But do you feel the pressure and thinking of that?

3:17:32.680 --> 3:17:34.720
 How much does that weigh on your heart?

3:17:34.720 --> 3:17:41.760
 So Elon has kids, I feel like I love everything and I love stuff I do.

3:17:41.760 --> 3:17:44.280
 I love the robot over there.

3:17:44.280 --> 3:17:55.360
 Just working out with robots but I do feel the pressure of like, almost like when there's

3:17:55.360 --> 3:18:00.360
 amazing cuisines you never tried or something like that, like go out there and try it.

3:18:00.360 --> 3:18:06.080
 Like you need to put in the work and I don't know, like life will run away from you, slip

3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:09.640
 through your fingers before you truly get to experience this other kind of love which

3:18:09.640 --> 3:18:18.040
 is like long term love for another human being which is like marriage and then love

3:18:18.040 --> 3:18:19.040
 for kids.

3:18:19.040 --> 3:18:20.040
 Yeah.

3:18:20.040 --> 3:18:29.200
 And it almost makes me sad like not getting to experience that because I'm also really

3:18:29.200 --> 3:18:35.240
 scared of, I've seen so many bad stories on the partner side, like being with the wrong

3:18:35.240 --> 3:18:36.240
 person.

3:18:36.240 --> 3:18:37.240
 Right.

3:18:37.240 --> 3:18:41.280
 But to me, I'm not worried, I have kids all day, in fact, I could probably just have kids

3:18:41.280 --> 3:18:45.840
 without the partner.

3:18:45.840 --> 3:18:47.360
 Kids I think are incredible.

3:18:47.360 --> 3:18:53.760
 With the partner, like a wife, it seems like she could then have the negative consequences

3:18:53.760 --> 3:18:58.080
 for like you as a writer on your productivity and your mental ability to flourish, being

3:18:58.080 --> 3:19:00.680
 a joy to others, all those kinds of things.

3:19:00.680 --> 3:19:06.320
 You know what, that couldn't happen because every relationship I've had, they've been

3:19:06.320 --> 3:19:15.440
 very beyond supportive, like they'd rather take an hour and do your work than spend time

3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:17.680
 with me, like I believe in what you're doing.

3:19:17.680 --> 3:19:21.240
 So I couldn't even casually date someone who didn't believe that.

3:19:21.240 --> 3:19:22.240
 So that's energizing.

3:19:22.240 --> 3:19:23.240
 Yes.

3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:26.800
 But over time, you never know like how that evolves and all those kinds of things.

3:19:26.800 --> 3:19:29.120
 And for me, I think we're a little bit different.

3:19:29.120 --> 3:19:32.800
 I mean, that has to do with the engineering thing, I just have to pull insane hours.

3:19:32.800 --> 3:19:33.800
 Yeah.

3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:34.800
 I don't.

3:19:34.800 --> 3:19:35.800
 I work like two hours a day.

3:19:35.800 --> 3:19:42.440
 But like creatives do, like you can only work a couple of hours, honestly, to be productive

3:19:42.440 --> 3:19:46.440
 and rest of the time not, I have to do a lot of menial labor.

3:19:46.440 --> 3:19:52.000
 And so there there's legit tension on time and attention, all those kinds of things.

3:19:52.000 --> 3:19:53.000
 I don't know.

3:19:53.000 --> 3:19:58.680
 Do you think about this stuff a lot or do you just love life and do cool stuff and whatever

3:19:58.680 --> 3:19:59.680
 happens, happens?

3:19:59.680 --> 3:20:05.120
 I have been so blessed for so long now that I'm at the point where I don't think about

3:20:05.120 --> 3:20:13.240
 it and I'm like, you know, just like miracles happen every day, so just be open to it.

3:20:13.240 --> 3:20:16.520
 You think about your death, mortality?

3:20:16.520 --> 3:20:17.520
 Yes.

3:20:17.520 --> 3:20:18.520
 Fear?

3:20:18.520 --> 3:20:19.520
 What do you feel about it?

3:20:19.520 --> 3:20:20.520
 I'm just worried.

3:20:20.520 --> 3:20:24.120
 I want to take as many people out with me as possible.

3:20:24.120 --> 3:20:25.120
 So suitcase nuke.

3:20:25.120 --> 3:20:26.120
 What's the best way?

3:20:26.120 --> 3:20:27.120
 Nuke.

3:20:27.120 --> 3:20:28.120
 Suitcase nuke, I'm thinking.

3:20:28.120 --> 3:20:29.120
 Yeah.

3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:35.280
 In New York, that would be kind of like ironic as my other favorite artist would say.

3:20:35.280 --> 3:20:41.640
 I think about my legacy and that's why my books are so important to me.

3:20:41.640 --> 3:20:45.340
 So do you think of it as a kind of immortality?

3:20:45.340 --> 3:20:46.340
 It is though.

3:20:46.340 --> 3:20:47.340
 Like that's who you are.

3:20:47.340 --> 3:20:48.340
 Is those books?

3:20:48.340 --> 3:20:49.340
 Well, it's not who I am.

3:20:49.340 --> 3:20:50.840
 My legacy certainly is.

3:20:50.840 --> 3:20:55.880
 What do you hope your legacy is?

3:20:55.880 --> 3:21:05.640
 That I encourage people to be hopeful and that I taught them how to be free.

3:21:05.640 --> 3:21:11.560
 And my favorite, I think the best show of all time was Dallas, which often gets, it

3:21:11.560 --> 3:21:15.880
 was like an 80s soap opera and people conflate it with Dynasty and they think it's trashy

3:21:15.880 --> 3:21:19.440
 and it was very Shakespearean because all the characters are motivated by different

3:21:19.440 --> 3:21:24.960
 values and the writing is just masterful and the acting is masterful.

3:21:24.960 --> 3:21:26.840
 And I'm not going to spoil anything.

3:21:26.840 --> 3:21:32.440
 One season ended with one of the characters on their deathbed in the hospital and the

3:21:32.440 --> 3:21:39.640
 whole cast is there and the amount of acting talent in that room is just phenomenal.

3:21:39.640 --> 3:21:45.200
 And as the characters dying, they look around and they go, like, please be kind to one another.

3:21:45.200 --> 3:21:46.360
 Be a family.

3:21:46.360 --> 3:21:49.360
 And they're yelling at this character, don't you dare die on me.

3:21:49.360 --> 3:21:53.040
 And you can see the actors because they're losing their castmate who they've had from

3:21:53.040 --> 3:21:54.040
 the beginning.

3:21:54.040 --> 3:21:56.760
 And it would have been a perfect ending to the show, but obviously it's a cash cow,

3:21:56.760 --> 3:21:58.720
 they got to keep milking it.

3:21:58.720 --> 3:22:04.680
 And I think that like kindness and tenderness, and this is Michael Malis talking, it's,

3:22:04.680 --> 3:22:11.320
 there's a lot of people who want to make it that if you are kind or tender, you're going

3:22:11.320 --> 3:22:14.240
 to have consequences, bad consequences.

3:22:14.240 --> 3:22:20.080
 And I think it's important for me at least to create a space in my life that if someone

3:22:20.080 --> 3:22:26.680
 is going to be nice or friendly or kind that they're not going to have to feel stupid or

3:22:26.680 --> 3:22:27.680
 bad about it.

3:22:27.680 --> 3:22:31.400
 It's, we have such a, it's such a disincentive, the set of structures so different, like

3:22:31.400 --> 3:22:36.040
 if you want to be cynical and sneering, like round of applause, but if someone says, oh,

3:22:36.040 --> 3:22:39.960
 this is great, like, okay, simp, it's, it's really bad.

3:22:39.960 --> 3:22:46.200
 Well, I think you do just this, you do this today, you do this in our friendship and you

3:22:46.200 --> 3:22:52.320
 can do it for a very large number of people's teach them how to be, how to have hope and

3:22:52.320 --> 3:22:55.440
 teach them how to be free.

3:22:55.440 --> 3:22:58.440
 So, Tavaresh.

3:22:58.440 --> 3:23:00.280
 It's nobom godom.

3:23:00.280 --> 3:23:01.280
 It's nobom godom.

3:23:01.280 --> 3:23:02.960
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

3:23:02.960 --> 3:23:04.880
 Thank you so much for being an inspiration.

3:23:04.880 --> 3:23:06.400
 I love you, brother.

3:23:06.400 --> 3:23:09.080
 I love you.

3:23:09.080 --> 3:23:11.320
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Malis.

3:23:11.320 --> 3:23:15.640
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:23:15.640 --> 3:23:19.240
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus.

3:23:19.240 --> 3:23:21.560
 Don't walk in front of me.

3:23:21.560 --> 3:23:23.480
 I may not follow.

3:23:23.480 --> 3:23:24.480
 Don't walk behind me.

3:23:24.480 --> 3:23:26.360
 I may not lead.

3:23:26.360 --> 3:23:27.760
 Walk beside me.

3:23:27.760 --> 3:23:30.240
 Just be my friend.

3:23:30.240 --> 3:23:46.320
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
