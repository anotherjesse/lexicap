00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
 The following is a conversation with Robert Breedlove, someone who caught my attention

00:04.760 --> 00:10.360
 and was recommended highly as a rigorous scholar and thinker in the space of decentralized

00:10.360 --> 00:12.280
 finance and Bitcoin.

00:12.280 --> 00:18.400
 His podcast titled What Is Money is a good representation of the way his mind works.

00:18.400 --> 00:24.200
 He's willing to talk through ideas for many hours, willing to listen, willing to think,

00:24.200 --> 00:29.840
 which makes him a great companion and conversation to explore the history, philosophy, and future

00:29.840 --> 00:32.080
 of money.

00:32.080 --> 00:38.340
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Fundrise, Element, Monkpak, and BetterHelp.

00:38.340 --> 00:41.840
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:41.840 --> 00:45.920
 As a side note, let me say that I'll have a number of conversations in the coming months

00:45.920 --> 00:49.440
 on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.440
 None of these conversations are financial advice.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.440
 That's not a legal warning.

00:53.440 --> 00:57.520
 That's a genuine description of my goals and approach with these chats.

00:57.520 --> 01:03.320
 At least for a while, I personally won't actively invest in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies

01:03.320 --> 01:06.400
 except to learn about the technology itself.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.440
 I don't think this should be a journalistic standard like The New York Times trying to

01:10.440 --> 01:13.200
 establish, which I very much disagree with.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.880
 In my humble opinion, I think journalists should be free to invest in Bitcoin if they

01:17.880 --> 01:18.880
 want to.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.440
 Luckily, I'm not a journalist.

01:21.440 --> 01:26.280
 I just know my own psychology and I feel that my thinking will be muddled by excitement

01:26.280 --> 01:29.000
 if I invest before I understand.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.400
 I feel the same way about Tesla, for example, I still don't own any Tesla stock and I am

01:34.400 --> 01:39.480
 still indeed fascinated by Tesla autopilot as an artificial intelligence system.

01:39.480 --> 01:46.760
 I work hard to be cognizant of the biases that arise in my mind and always try to choose

01:46.760 --> 01:53.480
 the path that maximizes or maintains a freedom of thought as much as possible.

01:53.480 --> 01:59.360
 Also, let me say that I try to be very careful in selecting guests based not only on the contents

01:59.360 --> 02:05.160
 of their ideas, but the richness, complexity, music, style of their mind and character.

02:05.160 --> 02:11.320
 Yes, I will talk with people with whom you and I may disagree, people who some may call

02:11.320 --> 02:14.760
 bad or even evil human beings.

02:14.760 --> 02:20.640
 I want to understand them because I believe that as Solzhenitsyn said, the battle line

02:20.640 --> 02:25.120
 between good and evil runs through the heart of every man.

02:25.120 --> 02:30.640
 I think if you always run from evil, you become blind to the truth of human nature.

02:30.640 --> 02:37.360
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Robert Breedlove.

02:37.360 --> 02:43.760
 Rousseau opens his 1762 book, The Social Contract, with the following statement.

02:43.760 --> 02:49.680
 Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains, so you talk about freedom and sovereignty

02:49.680 --> 02:51.000
 quite a bit.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.160
 What do these ideas mean to you, the idea of sovereignty?

02:55.160 --> 03:00.080
 Freedom and sovereignty, I think they're very closely related.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.480
 Let's start just focusing on sovereignty, which is a word I don't think we talk about

03:03.480 --> 03:05.360
 enough.

03:05.360 --> 03:13.200
 The general definition of that I would give is the authority to act as you see fit.

03:13.200 --> 03:19.440
 It's a word that's etymologically associated with words like monarchy, money, rain.

03:19.440 --> 03:25.560
 Historically, it's referred to whatever the locus of supreme power is in the sphere of

03:25.560 --> 03:26.560
 human action.

03:26.560 --> 03:32.880
 Whether if you go back into ancient Egypt, the pharaoh had absolute sovereignty and everyone

03:32.880 --> 03:36.880
 else was pretty much operating according to his interest.

03:36.880 --> 03:40.240
 You fast forward to today, modern Western democracy.

03:40.240 --> 03:45.280
 We have more decentralized sovereignty in that we all get to go vote and elect officials

03:45.280 --> 03:48.200
 that make decisions on our behalf.

03:48.200 --> 03:52.960
 The theme of sovereignty across history is that it's been gradually decentralizing across

03:52.960 --> 03:59.520
 our different models of socioeconomics.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.760
 You could say it's rooted heavily in the money, I would argue, which is something we'll get

04:03.760 --> 04:05.560
 a lot into here.

04:05.560 --> 04:11.720
 If you have money, you have the authority to act as you see fit in the world.

04:11.720 --> 04:16.200
 Even in our current political sphere, if you have enough money, you can actually reshape

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
 the rules.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.200
 You can reshape laws.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.480
 You can lobby Congress.

04:21.480 --> 04:25.640
 If you're in a certain situation like many billionaires, you can negotiate your own tax

04:25.640 --> 04:29.720
 treaty such that you can get favorable tax treatment with certain jurisdictions in the

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
 world.

04:30.720 --> 04:39.100
 This concept of sovereignty, which today we call, it's common to call states or nation

04:39.100 --> 04:44.920
 states or government sovereign, meaning that they have power over people.

04:44.920 --> 04:48.880
 As I argue in a lot of my writing, I actually think that sovereignty inheres within the

04:48.880 --> 04:55.480
 individual and that we each have our own interiorized space of choice, which is something like

04:55.480 --> 05:00.200
 Victor Franco called the final human freedom, and that we, no matter what our circumstances

05:00.200 --> 05:05.360
 are, no matter what exogenous situation we face, we always have this endogenous power

05:05.360 --> 05:07.920
 to choose how we respond to it.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.720
 That's one of my favorite books is Man's Search for Meaning.

05:11.720 --> 05:15.320
 You can break that apart a little bit.

05:15.320 --> 05:21.080
 You've spoken about sovereignty as a closely linked power, but is there something about

05:21.080 --> 05:27.320
 your own mind being able to achieve sovereignty, no matter what the monetary system is, no

05:27.320 --> 05:31.760
 matter what, who has the control over centralized power, the money, or whatever the mechanisms

05:31.760 --> 05:35.560
 of sovereignty at the societal level.

05:35.560 --> 05:41.120
 Use an individual isn't ultimately all boiled down to what you can do with your mind, how

05:41.120 --> 05:43.640
 you see the world, how you interpret it.

05:43.640 --> 05:44.640
 Yes.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.640
 I agree.

05:45.640 --> 05:49.600
 As we get a little bit deeper into this, I think we'll come to see money as an extension

05:49.600 --> 05:50.600
 of your mind.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.640
 There's a feedback between money and mind.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.840
 For instance, you think in dollars today, almost guarantee it.

05:55.840 --> 05:59.480
 Most of us do here in the US.

05:59.480 --> 06:00.480
 It's a tool.

06:00.480 --> 06:06.480
 It's a tool we're using to decomplexify the world around us, to deal with it, to understand

06:06.480 --> 06:10.600
 the sacrifices and successes across an entire history of economic transactions.

06:10.600 --> 06:14.560
 We can boil that all down to the price, so it's data compression.

06:14.560 --> 06:21.400
 If you can change, if there's a central body or central governance mechanism that can manipulate

06:21.400 --> 06:25.600
 that money, it can have an impact on your mind.

06:25.600 --> 06:31.400
 For instance, today, I agree with you on the first hand, say that I do believe in free

06:31.400 --> 06:32.400
 will.

06:32.400 --> 06:38.600
 I do believe in individual autonomy, but I also think that there are certain devices

06:38.600 --> 06:42.480
 and powers in the world around us that can actually influence how we think.

06:42.480 --> 06:46.960
 It's fascinating to think about the fact that money might be actually deeply integrated

06:46.960 --> 06:51.400
 into the way we think and into our mind.

06:51.400 --> 06:56.120
 You think about what are the core aspects of the human mind, what influences cognition,

06:56.120 --> 06:58.080
 the way you reason about the world.

06:58.080 --> 07:05.640
 You have the Chomsky languages at the core of everything, but you're placing money as

07:05.640 --> 07:11.880
 pretty close to the core of what it means to be an intelligent reasoning human.

07:11.880 --> 07:16.120
 I think money is a direct derivation of action and speech, actually.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.240
 It's another expression of the logos.

07:19.240 --> 07:26.160
 If we even think of what it means to think, is that we are generating two different courses

07:26.160 --> 07:31.280
 of action, potential courses of action, and we're populating them with avatars, maybe

07:31.280 --> 07:36.160
 ourselves or others, and then we're comparing how we may act in each situation and what

07:36.160 --> 07:37.960
 we think the result would be.

07:37.960 --> 07:42.760
 Actually, it's comparison, basically, it's comparison and contrasting of possible courses

07:42.760 --> 07:45.400
 of action.

07:45.400 --> 07:49.240
 That's the same thing with words themselves.

07:49.240 --> 07:55.760
 Most words, the vast majority of words, only have meaning in relationship to other words.

07:55.760 --> 07:59.880
 It's all contextual definitions of a word or more words.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.520
 People have argued with me about this because there is a first word where you pick up rock

08:03.520 --> 08:12.400
 and say rock, but most other words in higher abstraction tend to be relative.

08:12.400 --> 08:17.840
 What's funny about action and speech, and this gets, I got into a bit of this in our

08:17.840 --> 08:24.960
 paper here, is that it's linked to evolutionary biology, and that once human beings adopted

08:24.960 --> 08:30.480
 upright stance, we no longer needed our hands for locomotion.

08:30.480 --> 08:36.120
 We started to evolve more dexterity, and notably, we have opposable thumbs.

08:36.120 --> 08:40.280
 This gives us an ability to manipulate and particularize the environment in a way that

08:40.280 --> 08:42.560
 most other animals cannot.

08:42.560 --> 08:48.880
 What's interesting about this is that as we gain this ability to manipulate natural resources

08:48.880 --> 08:55.760
 and count, point, pointing was a big deal, and that we could indicate prey or items at

08:55.760 --> 09:00.600
 a far off distance, and we could organize ourselves.

09:00.600 --> 09:06.200
 At the same time, we co evolved this fine musculature in the face and tongue.

09:06.200 --> 09:12.160
 It's as if speech developed, co evolved really with our dexterity.

09:12.160 --> 09:17.280
 As a natural extension of that came us making tools.

09:17.280 --> 09:23.520
 We started to create things to better satisfy our wants over time, and the most tradable

09:23.520 --> 09:28.640
 tool in any society, or the most tradable thing, is money.

09:28.640 --> 09:35.360
 I argue that action and speech are quintessential modes of self sovereign expression, and the

09:35.360 --> 09:40.400
 money is just a tech layer we've put right on top of that, and that it's a natural derivation

09:40.400 --> 09:41.800
 of action and speech.

09:41.800 --> 09:47.880
 Okay, that's fascinating to think about sovereignty from the evolutionary perspective, and then

09:47.880 --> 09:53.800
 ultimately money is the technology layer that enables sovereignty.

09:53.800 --> 10:02.000
 It's really fascinating to think about our modern human society as deeply rooted in these

10:02.000 --> 10:07.720
 evolutionary roots from the very origins of life on earth.

10:07.720 --> 10:13.040
 Some of the ideas you just mentioned, what do you see are some interesting characteristics

10:13.040 --> 10:18.600
 of just life on earth that propagated to us humans?

10:18.600 --> 10:23.520
 What ideas propagated to have roots in the evolution?

10:23.520 --> 10:31.960
 Yeah, I think one of the deepest impulsions in life is the territorial imperative.

10:31.960 --> 10:38.160
 All life is seeking to expand its dominion over space and time.

10:38.160 --> 10:43.600
 We think about, again, physically with space, it's advantageous to an animal or an organism

10:43.600 --> 10:48.120
 to have more territory under its control to raise offspring.

10:48.120 --> 10:51.120
 It's all about reproductive fitness at the end of the day.

10:51.120 --> 10:58.120
 We could also think of reproduction itself as the genetic impulse to replicate oneself

10:58.120 --> 11:02.360
 across time, so it's territoriality across time in a way.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.120
 This is very common in most animals.

11:04.120 --> 11:07.760
 Not all animals are territorial, but many are.

11:07.760 --> 11:11.680
 You see very interesting behaviors resulting from territoriality.

11:11.680 --> 11:20.840
 This is animal combat, the reason birds sing is territoriality, a number of other things.

11:20.840 --> 11:28.080
 It's my hypothesis, and others have shared this hypothesis as well, that mankind is clearly,

11:28.080 --> 11:32.920
 I think, what are your territorial species, and that he expresses this territoriality

11:32.920 --> 11:37.720
 in property rights.

11:37.720 --> 11:38.720
 We hear that word.

11:38.720 --> 11:39.720
 We typically think of an asset.

11:39.720 --> 11:44.480
 We think of, oh, this house or this stock or whatever, but property is actually the socially

11:44.480 --> 11:49.840
 acknowledged relationship between a human and an asset, such that you have exclusive

11:49.840 --> 11:53.920
 rights and responsibilities to a particular asset.

11:53.920 --> 11:58.240
 It is not the asset itself, so property, it's information.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.240
 It's a relationship.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.520
 By the way, my mind was just blown.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.520
 Property is information.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.360
 It's not the actual asset.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.760
 That's really important.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.760
 Very important.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.760
 That's really interesting.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.760
 Yeah.

12:08.760 --> 12:19.400
 Then it comes down to how do we organize ourselves such that the contributions people are making

12:19.400 --> 12:22.400
 are commensurate with the consideration they're receiving.

12:22.400 --> 12:28.000
 If you're adding value to a piece of property, you're developing a piece of land for use,

12:28.000 --> 12:33.560
 in theory, to be fair, you should have the rights to that fruit, if you go out and plant

12:33.560 --> 12:38.600
 a garden or whatever it may be.

12:38.600 --> 12:44.480
 This is rooted in natural law, where we have rights to life, liberty, and property.

12:44.480 --> 12:50.440
 There's the fundamental layer of morality and capitalism, frankly.

12:50.440 --> 12:58.120
 You could think of, to get really primordial with it, the first capitalist in the world,

12:58.120 --> 13:03.920
 just to get some definitions out here, I'll say capitalism versus communism or socialism

13:03.920 --> 13:06.120
 as the spectrum I'll speak on.

13:06.120 --> 13:10.880
 The first capitalist in the world would be the guy, the caveman, that maybe dug a little

13:10.880 --> 13:15.120
 hole for himself to shield himself from the elements.

13:15.120 --> 13:19.760
 Maybe there was a rainstorm, a snowstorm, and he dug a little enclave and he protected

13:19.760 --> 13:20.760
 himself.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.320
 I thought you were going to go, because he said primordial, I thought you were going

13:23.320 --> 13:26.240
 to go back to earlier biological systems.

13:26.240 --> 13:31.520
 I guess primordial for humans.

13:31.520 --> 13:36.440
 Then the first communists or socialists would be someone that decided the fruits of his

13:36.440 --> 13:41.840
 labor belong to him, so he would have violently encroached on that individual and taken his

13:41.840 --> 13:47.800
 plot for himself for his own use.

13:47.800 --> 13:52.760
 That's the spectrum across which capitalism in the pure sense and communism in the pure

13:52.760 --> 13:58.160
 sense operate, in that capitalism, each individual has the exclusive rights to the fruits of

13:58.160 --> 13:59.720
 their labor.

13:59.720 --> 14:04.400
 Anything they spend their time, effort, energy, creating in the world, they own the rights

14:04.400 --> 14:08.360
 to that and they can trade those rights with others, other self owned people that have

14:08.360 --> 14:10.800
 done similar things.

14:10.800 --> 14:16.080
 Communism or socialism would imply that other people, typically the state, have the rights,

14:16.080 --> 14:19.800
 at least some rights to the value you've created.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.080
 There's this interesting moment when that first caveman, that first capitalist drew

14:24.080 --> 14:29.960
 a line, circle in this cave and said, this is mine.

14:29.960 --> 14:34.280
 You could say it was free to be claimed at the time he claimed it.

14:34.280 --> 14:41.800
 But, it's an interesting moment when asset becomes an asset.

14:41.800 --> 14:46.800
 When space time, as you were referring to, becomes something that's now, can be possessed

14:46.800 --> 14:48.960
 by a human being.

14:48.960 --> 14:54.080
 Is there something special about this moment because it feels like, first of all, in terms

14:54.080 --> 15:02.080
 of space and time, it feels like there's a lot of available space time yet to be claimed.

15:02.080 --> 15:08.280
 If we just look at the universe, we're talking about, there's a funny thing with Elon Musk

15:08.280 --> 15:15.380
 and Mars, I think they sneaked in there for SpaceX, that nobody on Earth has any authority

15:15.380 --> 15:17.680
 on Mars.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.000
 This is a very interesting question.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.120
 It seems almost like humorous at this time, but perhaps not, perhaps there'll be sections

15:24.120 --> 15:28.680
 of space, not just on planets, that are going to be even fought over.

15:28.680 --> 15:35.600
 Is there something special about this moment because in discussing violence and respect

15:35.600 --> 15:42.600
 for property, it feels like this is a special moment because ultimately conflict arises

15:42.600 --> 15:47.440
 when you make claims on a particular territory.

15:47.440 --> 15:51.920
 It's not always in conflict where people say, when you look at Hitler or something, for

15:51.920 --> 15:58.440
 example, his claim would be in many of the lands that he attacked and invaded that this

15:58.440 --> 16:03.760
 is ultimately, this has always belonged to Germany.

16:03.760 --> 16:10.640
 Is there something you could say as to what it means to own an asset or a property?

16:10.640 --> 16:11.640
 Yeah.

16:11.640 --> 16:18.120
 In the ancient days of hunters and gatherers, we could say that property was mostly a loyal

16:18.120 --> 16:22.520
 title, which meant it's just whatever you can defend.

16:22.520 --> 16:28.960
 If you've got knives and daggers and satchels and maybe some pelts you've hunted, whatever

16:28.960 --> 16:32.640
 you can hold and defend is yours.

16:32.640 --> 16:38.160
 There's not like there's a government to appeal to, you're just a free agent operating

16:38.160 --> 16:46.240
 in the wild defending the assets you can protect on you, more or less.

16:46.240 --> 16:52.280
 What really changed the nature of property is when we get into the agricultural age.

16:52.280 --> 16:56.800
 There's a big flip where we went from just foraging and hunting all the time, constantly

16:56.800 --> 17:00.480
 moving, trying to stay alive to deciding, we're going to settle here.

17:00.480 --> 17:06.680
 We figured out how to cultivate crops, we can increase the population because we can

17:06.680 --> 17:11.400
 harvest more energy from the sun and we can establish a longer term civilization.

17:11.400 --> 17:16.720
 What happens in that transition is that we begin creating economic surplus.

17:16.720 --> 17:23.520
 For the first time in history, we have stockhouses of grain to defend or maybe meat or cattle

17:23.520 --> 17:29.520
 or whatever it is we're creating, we now have savings.

17:29.520 --> 17:35.240
 It's at that time when government emerges as well because once you have savings or you

17:35.240 --> 17:39.400
 have an economic surplus, you have something that other people want to steal.

17:39.400 --> 17:44.440
 This one thing we'll touch on a lot today is people always want something for nothing.

17:44.440 --> 17:48.360
 People are always seeking the path to get something for nothing.

17:48.360 --> 17:53.640
 I think that drives a lot of our decision making and actually encourages us to be innovative

17:53.640 --> 17:56.880
 in a lot of ways.

17:56.880 --> 18:00.040
 You could say it's our laziness, it's helping us be inventive in a way, we're trying to

18:00.040 --> 18:06.640
 accomplish greater results with less efforts over time, but we can cross that line in seeking

18:06.640 --> 18:10.520
 something for nothing where we start to violate the life, liberty and property of others.

18:10.520 --> 18:17.800
 That's where we shift from kind of capitalistic society to something more communistic.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.920
 That's what government is.

18:18.920 --> 18:25.480
 It's a protection producing enterprise for the economic surplus generated by a trading

18:25.480 --> 18:26.480
 society.

18:26.480 --> 18:31.440
 When people begin to trade, they create what's called the division of labor, which is a very

18:31.440 --> 18:33.320
 common economic term.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.480
 Basically means you're better at making hats, I'm better at making boots.

18:37.480 --> 18:41.620
 If you specialize in hats, I specialize in boots and we trade, we've created a positive

18:41.620 --> 18:44.040
 sum game for you and I both benefit.

18:44.040 --> 18:48.760
 We become collectively more than the sum of our parts through trade.

18:48.760 --> 18:54.040
 That's why human beings do trade because we become more energy efficient as a result.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.760
 We create more outputs per unit of input.

18:56.760 --> 19:01.120
 You could think of government in that respect, if we're looking at maybe in a tech sense

19:01.120 --> 19:06.720
 that the economy is the trade network that generates wealth, generates innovation, generates

19:06.720 --> 19:11.680
 all, this whole lap of luxury we live in today that we've inherited from our forebears is

19:11.680 --> 19:12.680
 from the market.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.160
 It's not from a government.

19:14.160 --> 19:18.360
 The government is the network security, if you will.

19:18.360 --> 19:23.160
 We're paying expenses to a vendor to protect peace, to preserve life, liberty and property

19:23.160 --> 19:28.160
 in that network so that we can have, when there's inevitably disputes over private property,

19:28.160 --> 19:33.560
 we can have nonviolent dispute resolution in the rule of law.

19:33.560 --> 19:39.480
 We can have a reasonable expectation of being able to conduct commerce without violence.

19:39.480 --> 19:45.760
 The problem has been that the protector tends to, they're in a monopolistic position, we

19:45.760 --> 19:46.760
 would say.

19:46.760 --> 19:53.540
 They tend to start abusing that position to obtain property for themselves, again, trying

19:53.540 --> 19:55.920
 to get that something for nothing.

19:55.920 --> 20:02.200
 When you control, you are the security guard for the economy.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.880
 The first thing they tend to monopolize is money because if you can control the money,

20:05.880 --> 20:10.800
 you're effectively controlling people, their energy, their perceptions.

20:10.800 --> 20:17.480
 That becomes a, particularly through inflation, becomes an avenue to get something for nothing

20:17.480 --> 20:22.400
 and that you can just print more money that everyone else is forced to sacrifice their

20:22.400 --> 20:24.200
 time and energy to obtain.

20:24.200 --> 20:28.440
 What are your thoughts about anarchism?

20:28.440 --> 20:34.560
 I talk quite a bit, he'll be here in a few days actually, Michael Malice, about ideas

20:34.560 --> 20:41.560
 of anarchy and his idea or the idea of anarchists is that any amount of government will eventually

20:41.560 --> 20:45.960
 become the very kind of thing that you're referring to.

20:45.960 --> 20:52.360
 There's almost no way to have a government that doesn't then try to monopolize power,

20:52.360 --> 20:54.460
 money and all those kinds of things.

20:54.460 --> 20:59.800
 Do you think it's possible to have a government sort of on that spectrum of like anarchy,

20:59.800 --> 21:06.600
 maybe libertarianism, I'm not sure how exactly the spectrum goes, but where you have a small

21:06.600 --> 21:11.320
 government that protects the liberty and property rights and those kinds of things and doesn't

21:11.320 --> 21:17.080
 expand to then also control the monetary system and all those other things?

21:17.080 --> 21:18.080
 Is it possible?

21:18.080 --> 21:19.960
 Agreed, agreed completely.

21:19.960 --> 21:24.240
 It was not possible until Satoshi Nakamoto.

21:24.240 --> 21:29.440
 So for the first time in history, we have a money that cannot be monopolized, cannot

21:29.440 --> 21:34.520
 be corrupted, cannot be changed, cannot be weaponized, frankly.

21:34.520 --> 21:38.560
 Our current monetary system is weaponized by those who can print money against those

21:38.560 --> 21:41.920
 who cannot.

21:41.920 --> 21:47.480
 And I think when you have at the heart of every modern economy, which even we could

21:47.480 --> 21:53.480
 say the US, we pride ourselves as free market capitalists, we outcompeted communism in the

21:53.480 --> 21:54.480
 20th century.

21:54.480 --> 21:58.560
 We think that this is the superior model.

21:58.560 --> 22:03.840
 Most business people will tell you that the free market is the best allocator of resources,

22:03.840 --> 22:05.440
 all of these things.

22:05.440 --> 22:09.920
 But what we have at the heart of every modern economy, including the US, is an anti capitalistic

22:09.920 --> 22:13.640
 institution, which is the central bank.

22:13.640 --> 22:17.400
 The temptation to monopolize money throughout all of history has been too strong for anyone

22:17.400 --> 22:18.800
 to resist.

22:18.800 --> 22:24.400
 So even benevolent, quote unquote, dictators that have taken over, many dictators have

22:24.400 --> 22:28.720
 inherited, say, an inflationary regime where society is coming apart because someone was

22:28.720 --> 22:32.320
 clipping the coins or someone was printing too much money, and they'll commit to going

22:32.320 --> 22:34.240
 back to a hard money standard.

22:34.240 --> 22:40.440
 So they'll keep society on a gold standard, for instance, such that they cannot violate

22:40.440 --> 22:43.120
 the money to benefit themselves.

22:43.120 --> 22:49.640
 But inevitably over time, because it is a political institution, there's an incentive

22:49.640 --> 22:55.520
 there, again, to get something for nothing, to spend more than you're making through

22:55.520 --> 22:57.680
 tax revenues.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.840
 And with that incentive, people typically ultimately end up pursuing that inflationary

23:01.840 --> 23:03.560
 path.

23:03.560 --> 23:09.480
 So we get deeper into that about inflation is a term that we've been conditioned to

23:09.480 --> 23:14.760
 think today is just something normal, the prices just go up, and then it's pertinent

23:14.760 --> 23:16.760
 to a healthy economy.

23:16.760 --> 23:21.760
 But it's actually, if you look at it from real first principles, it is just theft integrated

23:21.760 --> 23:22.760
 into the money.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.520
 It's a technology backdoor is another way to think about it.

23:25.520 --> 23:30.040
 You wouldn't buy a cell phone knowing that someone could siphon your data off your private

23:30.040 --> 23:31.640
 calls and sell it into the market.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.600
 Now, I know we do that with a lot of social media stuff today, and that's something else

23:34.600 --> 23:37.640
 we can get into, but you wouldn't do it willingly, right?

23:37.640 --> 23:42.640
 You prefer that your cell phone and your data was monetized by you, or if you're going to

23:42.640 --> 23:46.000
 sell it, you would be able to selectively sell it.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.200
 Inflation is that it's similar, it's a tech backdoor.

23:49.200 --> 23:57.480
 So it's a money that only a few people can siphon value off of, surreptitiously, typically

23:57.480 --> 24:02.520
 slowly, but eventually, as we've seen throughout history, that slowly builds up into it rapidly

24:02.520 --> 24:05.520
 and then causes the monetary system to collapse.

24:05.520 --> 24:10.160
 Do you think there's a benefit to inflation possibly?

24:10.160 --> 24:15.400
 So when you have perfect information, perhaps you don't need inflation, perhaps it is purely

24:15.400 --> 24:22.000
 theft, but I think of inflation as like the snooze button on the alarm.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.320
 So if you have a hard standard, you better wake up when the alarm rings, but all of us

24:27.320 --> 24:31.720
 kind of like probably shouldn't, but use the snooze button, it's like, okay, well, five

24:31.720 --> 24:33.560
 more minutes or 10 more minutes.

24:33.560 --> 24:39.280
 And then you're saying there's naturally a slippery slope where you become a drug that

24:39.280 --> 24:42.240
 you fall in love with in your abuse.

24:42.240 --> 24:47.920
 But nevertheless, the usefulness of the snooze button is that you don't know how you'll be

24:47.920 --> 24:50.400
 actually feeling when the alarm rings.

24:50.400 --> 24:54.520
 You might be able to ready to pop up, or you might be like, you really need those few more

24:54.520 --> 24:58.240
 minutes to psychologically get yourself out of bed.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.000
 This metaphor is just not working at all.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.960
 But do you think there's a use to inflation sometimes from like an economics perspective?

25:06.960 --> 25:13.120
 I think the drug metaphor is a little more apt in that inflation does provide an immediately

25:13.120 --> 25:19.840
 stimulative effect when used early on.

25:19.840 --> 25:27.640
 But what it's doing is it's, again, we talk about the balance between incentives and disincentives.

25:27.640 --> 25:32.040
 That being necessary for a system to function properly.

25:32.040 --> 25:38.320
 With inflation, you're essentially giving the people that can print money a way to dampen

25:38.320 --> 25:40.920
 the disincentives they face.

25:40.920 --> 25:46.680
 So it destroys feedback loops, I guess you might say.

25:46.680 --> 25:52.360
 And another way to look at this is when you, so using inflation, using quantitative easing,

25:52.360 --> 25:57.000
 you can decrease short term volatility in the marketplace.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.120
 So the market is basically this idea, this form of free exchange that's trying to zero

26:03.120 --> 26:04.600
 in on the best ideas.

26:04.600 --> 26:08.920
 And the ideas are those that are most fit to reality, to satisfying the most wants.

26:08.920 --> 26:09.920
 It's going to overshoot.

26:09.920 --> 26:10.920
 It's going to undershoot.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.080
 You have these little business cycles.

26:12.080 --> 26:19.160
 But when it's undershooting and you're experiencing business recession, in a capitalist environment,

26:19.160 --> 26:23.320
 the market needs to clear that malinvestment, that misallocation of capital.

26:23.320 --> 26:27.440
 I mean, someone made a bet on a certain idea that it would satisfy wants in a particular

26:27.440 --> 26:29.560
 way, and that bet did not pan out.

26:29.560 --> 26:35.680
 If you then paper over the losses that business is creating, you're now delaying and exacerbating

26:35.680 --> 26:39.280
 the volatility that that idea created.

26:39.280 --> 26:46.880
 So this is kind of a Tullibian concept where you can dampen short run volatility, but volatility

26:46.880 --> 26:48.840
 is truth.

26:48.840 --> 26:53.480
 Volatility is us matching our ideas to reality.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.280
 We're constantly, again, overshooting and undershooting.

26:55.280 --> 27:01.280
 So you delay volatility, you're just amplifying it and exacerbating it in the long run.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.720
 And that's what Central Bank is doing.

27:02.720 --> 27:13.400
 The Central Bank mandate is low unemployment and low and expected inflation, basically.

27:13.400 --> 27:19.360
 And so they're trying to achieve economic growth in a stable way, quote, unquote, stable

27:19.360 --> 27:20.360
 way.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.480
 This is their ostensible purpose.

27:22.480 --> 27:24.080
 And that's just not possible.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.880
 Growth is an inherently unstable process.

27:27.880 --> 27:33.440
 Can you elaborate a little bit about the nature of volatility?

27:33.440 --> 27:37.280
 Why is it communicating truth?

27:37.280 --> 27:40.560
 That's something that a lot of people are afraid of is the volatility.

27:40.560 --> 27:44.360
 It's like it's a sign of chaos.

27:44.360 --> 27:48.520
 So they want to escape chaos.

27:48.520 --> 27:54.040
 But you're saying that that's actually, whether it's chaos or not, I don't know, but it's

27:54.040 --> 28:00.120
 getting us closer to the fundamental reality that we should not be trying to escape.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.120
 Yeah.

28:01.120 --> 28:08.760
 So if we consider that the universe is pervaded by entropy, this is the second law of thermodynamics.

28:08.760 --> 28:13.600
 Because every closed system tends towards greater disorder over time.

28:13.600 --> 28:20.520
 And that life itself, again, I would argue, expressed through the logos, we, life, is

28:20.520 --> 28:21.920
 the antientropic principle.

28:21.920 --> 28:26.840
 It's the only thing that's converting entropy into order, chaos into order.

28:26.840 --> 28:30.000
 And that's what entrepreneurs are doing.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.800
 We're living at the edges of the known.

28:32.800 --> 28:38.440
 And we're testing ourselves against the entropy of nature, trying to figure out new and better

28:38.440 --> 28:41.120
 ways of saying, doing or making things.

28:41.120 --> 28:46.040
 And then if we do crack a code or figure something out, we then have a big incentive, the incentive

28:46.040 --> 28:47.040
 is to get rich, right?

28:47.040 --> 28:51.000
 Because then you have a new idea that you could then sell back into the marketplace.

28:51.000 --> 28:59.600
 So it's this sequence of courageously confronting the entropy of nature and converting it into

28:59.600 --> 29:04.120
 good and useful order, which by the way is like the ancient idea of God and Genesis,

29:04.120 --> 29:10.360
 which I think is interesting, that actually enables us to construct civilization in these

29:10.360 --> 29:15.000
 layers of antientropy or order, you might say.

29:15.000 --> 29:22.160
 So today we live in a bubble of, of antientropy or order, you know, like the coastlines are

29:22.160 --> 29:29.120
 guarded by the nation and the city has a certain police force that keeps it in order.

29:29.120 --> 29:34.040
 Even the way we talk, like there's clearly the words matter, but also the nonverbal cues,

29:34.040 --> 29:38.840
 all these things are like order that has been established over many, many, many thousands

29:38.840 --> 29:42.000
 of years of human evolution.

29:42.000 --> 29:49.080
 And I think that when I say volatility is truth, what I'm saying is that the experience

29:49.080 --> 29:54.080
 of uncertainty is something that's ineradicable from life, right?

29:54.080 --> 29:58.960
 And certainty, like it's kind of a paradox because it's, we're fighting against it, right?

29:58.960 --> 30:03.680
 We're trying to innovate our way away from uncertainty to give us, to create more capital,

30:03.680 --> 30:09.600
 which capital is very simply a way of mitigating uncertainty.

30:09.600 --> 30:13.720
 So this is why you might have like a stash of food in case, you know, the power goes

30:13.720 --> 30:17.960
 out or a generator, like it helps you overcome uncertainty over time.

30:17.960 --> 30:21.480
 But uncertainty is also where all the sweetness of life is.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.520
 So there's got to be this balance with one foot in, one foot out.

30:24.520 --> 30:30.560
 So human society is this kind of bubble of order that we've constructed and slowly expanding,

30:30.560 --> 30:34.720
 but at the edges you're always going to have that chaos, that volatility, and that the

30:34.720 --> 30:41.280
 entrepreneurs are kind of like jumping into that chaos and some of them die and some of

30:41.280 --> 30:42.280
 them succeed.

30:42.280 --> 30:50.480
 And so like if you want to grow this bubble of order, you have to be embracing the volatility

30:50.480 --> 30:53.480
 at the edges.

30:53.480 --> 30:59.040
 And reverence for entrepreneurship, because these are the people putting their neck out,

30:59.040 --> 31:01.400
 so to speak, risking themselves.

31:01.400 --> 31:04.480
 And they're going to contribute to society, by the way, whether they go up in flames

31:04.480 --> 31:05.480
 or not.

31:05.480 --> 31:09.600
 If they go up in flames, society has witnessed their experience as something not to do or

31:09.600 --> 31:13.760
 something that doesn't work in a particular time and place, so that you could say they're,

31:13.760 --> 31:16.960
 them going up in flames is a way of enlightening the rest of us.

31:16.960 --> 31:21.200
 Or if they figure something out, you know, Steve Jobs creates the iPhone, changes the

31:21.200 --> 31:22.200
 world forever.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.640
 So enlightening the rest of us.

31:24.640 --> 31:29.520
 And Taleb would say, the fire of their failure, okay, yeah, exactly.

31:29.520 --> 31:38.680
 Taleb would say individual fragility is inseparable from ensemble anti fragility.

31:38.680 --> 31:44.120
 So this means that, again, every time that entrepreneur goes up in flames or say a restaurant

31:44.120 --> 31:49.400
 goes out of business, when a restaurant goes out of business, that particular cuisine strategy

31:49.400 --> 31:52.440
 they were implementing in that particular time and place, that's a signal to all the

31:52.440 --> 31:55.000
 other restaurants in the area that that doesn't work.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.760
 So restaurant food improves from bankruptcy to bankruptcy.

31:59.760 --> 32:05.560
 So is this death of the individual components that contributes to the growth of the ensemble?

32:05.560 --> 32:07.840
 As a smaller side, maybe you can guide me through it.

32:07.840 --> 32:14.000
 I don't know if you're paying attention, but there was some chaos around Taleb and the

32:14.000 --> 32:15.560
 Bitcoin community.

32:15.560 --> 32:18.120
 I wasn't quite paying attention.

32:18.120 --> 32:24.680
 But from my outsider's perspective, I thought Taleb was a supporter of Bitcoin.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.880
 And then a lot of people were very upset about something.

32:26.880 --> 32:32.560
 I'm sorry if I don't know the details, but can you pull out some profound philosophical

32:32.560 --> 32:34.800
 ideas from the disagreement of the chaos?

32:34.800 --> 32:38.360
 I admittedly don't know too much about it either.

32:38.360 --> 32:41.560
 I have a big fan of his writing.

32:41.560 --> 32:45.880
 He's always been a little different in person.

32:45.880 --> 32:48.920
 He signed one of my books, I met him in person.

32:48.920 --> 32:52.320
 He's got a very abrasive personality, he's kind of known for it.

32:52.320 --> 32:56.120
 I don't think I'm passing any judgment here, he sort of embraces it.

32:56.120 --> 33:01.160
 But he had written the foreword to a really important book in Bitcoin called the Bitcoin

33:01.160 --> 33:03.960
 Standard for safety in Amuse.

33:03.960 --> 33:10.160
 And then I think they had a little Twitter beef because safety is very much against COVID

33:10.160 --> 33:15.480
 mask and state intervention, whereas Taleb's on the other side of the fence.

33:15.480 --> 33:20.800
 And then after that beef, Taleb came out against Bitcoiners saying, oh, Bitcoiners are crazy

33:20.800 --> 33:21.800
 and wrong.

33:21.800 --> 33:26.360
 I think the great mask debate of the 2020 will probably be the thing that ultimately

33:26.360 --> 33:28.360
 leads to World War III.

33:28.360 --> 33:37.640
 I've been very surprised how tense, how much division this one little arguably silly thing

33:37.640 --> 33:39.080
 has led to.

33:39.080 --> 33:44.680
 I think a lot of people sort of project their, it's almost like not wearing a mask is a statement

33:44.680 --> 33:49.840
 of sovereignty, of freedom, of like saying, fuck you to the man, the government, the centralized

33:49.840 --> 33:56.440
 power, or the dishonesty, or the, in the scientific community, all those kinds of things.

33:56.440 --> 34:03.600
 And then wearing a mask is a sort of kind of signaling of various kind of social aspects.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.600
 I don't know.

34:04.600 --> 34:05.600
 I'm not paying attention to it.

34:05.600 --> 34:09.520
 I actually tuned out, I was part of a group of scientists that were looking into like

34:09.520 --> 34:12.080
 do masks work, this very interesting question.

34:12.080 --> 34:17.720
 To me, it was an interesting question, I sort of roll in to ask that very interesting question,

34:17.720 --> 34:20.600
 because I think it is an interesting scientific question.

34:20.600 --> 34:25.480
 But then I quickly realized that just as I was doing this like scientific exploration

34:25.480 --> 34:31.120
 of this very interesting question about viral particles, like what kind of things like from

34:31.120 --> 34:35.360
 a scientific perspective, how do we prevent the spread of a pandemic, forget COVID, any

34:35.360 --> 34:38.160
 pandemic, super deadly or not deadly.

34:38.160 --> 34:41.680
 Like there's tools, there's testing, there's masks, there's all these tools.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.320
 How well do they work?

34:43.320 --> 34:49.000
 And then I realized, you know, in April or so, it became a tool of politics, a tool of

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
 philosophy.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
 And that's when I sort of pulled out.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
 So it's fascinating.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.680
 I think it's a canvas on which people project their emotions and I guess until I got caught

34:59.680 --> 35:04.760
 up in that kind of, so there's nothing fundamental, I suppose, to their disagreement.

35:04.760 --> 35:13.200
 Not that I'm aware of, but he's written some about in his books, the problem with centralization.

35:13.200 --> 35:18.560
 I mean, a lot of his writing addresses that and he actually points to, I think Switzerland

35:18.560 --> 35:23.000
 is the best government in the world because it's decentralized.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.080
 So there's that.

35:25.080 --> 35:30.800
 I don't think he has any, I'm not to speak for him, but I don't think he's voiced any

35:30.800 --> 35:34.760
 specific critiques on Bitcoin per se.

35:34.760 --> 35:35.760
 Could be wrong about that.

35:35.760 --> 35:39.680
 It's just maybe his flavorful language and the way he likes to communicate.

35:39.680 --> 35:44.240
 And the other theory is that maybe he's playing 4D chess and having a Twitter boating accident,

35:44.240 --> 35:45.240
 you know?

35:45.240 --> 35:46.240
 So I don't believe in Bitcoin.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.960
 I've sold on my Bitcoin and.

35:47.960 --> 35:49.560
 Oh, I see.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.560
 Yeah.

35:50.560 --> 35:56.680
 Sorry, the boating accident in Bitcoin is this, I guess it's proverbial by this point

35:56.680 --> 35:59.480
 where it's the way you lose your Bitcoin.

35:59.480 --> 36:03.000
 So if someone comes after you and says, hey, you know, whether it's a government or an

36:03.000 --> 36:06.320
 individual is coming after you, so you can give me all your Bitcoin or pay these taxes

36:06.320 --> 36:09.360
 in Bitcoin, you go, oh, I had a boating accident and lost them all.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.360
 Lost them all.

36:10.360 --> 36:13.600
 So, yeah.

36:13.600 --> 36:18.600
 But back to the fundamental nature of space time, let me ask you, because we're kind of

36:18.600 --> 36:19.600
 left it.

36:19.600 --> 36:27.200
 I'd like to go back to this idea of that you said that everything we think say or do occurs

36:27.200 --> 36:31.200
 within the bounds of space time.

36:31.200 --> 36:35.760
 So first of all, maybe you can comment on what do you mean in this context about space

36:35.760 --> 36:43.560
 time, but also about the nature of truth, like how much of all of this is noble?

36:43.560 --> 36:46.440
 How much of this is accessible to us humans?

36:46.440 --> 36:50.960
 How much uncertainty, like we're talking about, is there in the world?

36:50.960 --> 36:56.280
 Are you, do you fall into a place where we can reason deeply about this world and it's

36:56.280 --> 37:00.680
 noble or is it mostly chaos and we're just holding on for dear life?

37:00.680 --> 37:05.520
 Yeah, I think I said that all action occurs within the bounds of space time.

37:05.520 --> 37:09.560
 The other thing, everything we say, do or make, the other thing is that everything we

37:09.560 --> 37:12.560
 say, do or make starts out as an idea.

37:12.560 --> 37:19.960
 So there's this concept of universal Darwinism, which basically applies Darwinian principles

37:19.960 --> 37:22.000
 but outside of the biological sphere.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.840
 So we could say that this kind of gets into Richard Dawkins memetics, that even ideas

37:25.840 --> 37:29.160
 are competing, reproducing, recombining.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.800
 That idea is so powerful, by the way.

37:30.800 --> 37:34.320
 I don't think it's been understood fully.

37:34.320 --> 37:40.440
 I think in the digital, in the 21st century, in the digital world, from my perspective

37:40.440 --> 37:45.320
 in artificial intelligence, there's yet to be some profound things to be discovered about

37:45.320 --> 37:47.440
 this whole construct.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.960
 Agreed completely.

37:48.960 --> 37:55.440
 It's been called an acid, actually, in that it just, it strips away all of the non informational

37:55.440 --> 37:56.440
 components of something.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.320
 It just strips it down to its bare bones.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.560
 I have a quote in here somewhere about that, but...

38:01.560 --> 38:04.160
 All right, so which is called an acid, the ideas?

38:04.160 --> 38:06.240
 The universal Darwinism.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.320
 Darwinism applied broadly, outside of the...

38:08.320 --> 38:09.320
 I mean, broadly.

38:09.320 --> 38:14.520
 And I would all condition all of this with saying that a lot, most of my thinking is

38:14.520 --> 38:19.960
 shaped by a book I read recently called The Case Against Reality, which introduced me to

38:19.960 --> 38:20.960
 this concept.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.600
 But it tied into Darwinism that I've used more broadly in the past, looking at things

38:24.600 --> 38:26.360
 like money and economics.

38:26.360 --> 38:32.680
 So the book, The Case Against Reality, by Donald Hoffman, he has a quote in the book

38:32.680 --> 38:34.760
 that describes universal Darwinism.

38:34.760 --> 38:41.600
 It says, quote, universal Darwinism can, without risk of refuting itself, address our key question.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.840
 Does natural selection favor true perceptions?

38:44.840 --> 38:49.160
 If the answer happens to be no, then it hasn't shot itself in the foot.

38:49.160 --> 38:54.120
 The uncanny power of universal Darwinism has been likened by the philosopher, Dan Dennett,

38:54.120 --> 38:56.840
 to a universal acid.

38:56.840 --> 39:01.640
 And Dan Dennett says, quote, there is no denying at this point that Darwin's idea is a universal

39:01.640 --> 39:05.760
 solvent, capable of cutting right to the heart of everything in sight.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.040
 The question is, what does it leave behind?

39:08.040 --> 39:12.560
 I have tried to show that once it passes through everything, we are left with stronger, sounder

39:12.560 --> 39:15.960
 versions of our most important ideas.

39:15.960 --> 39:20.480
 Some of the traditional details perish, and some of these are losses to be regretted,

39:20.480 --> 39:22.360
 but good riddance to the rest of them.

39:22.360 --> 39:26.480
 The remains is more than enough to build on, unquote.

39:26.480 --> 39:33.960
 So the way I would interpret that is that life itself, I've come to view life as information

39:33.960 --> 39:42.800
 propagating through flesh, and that we are, I guess, DNA is a quadratic code.

39:42.800 --> 39:46.720
 I think it's four letters, maybe, versus the binaries, zeros and ones.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.160
 And we are ideas.

39:48.160 --> 39:51.200
 We are strategies competing with each other.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.400
 But nature is that which selects.

39:54.400 --> 40:01.480
 It's what selects the winning ideas, the ones that are most fit to environmental conditions,

40:01.480 --> 40:02.480
 frankly.

40:02.480 --> 40:10.640
 Talking about sovereignty and individualism, there might need to be some rethinking here

40:10.640 --> 40:16.320
 about what is actually the basic individual entity that is to be sovereign.

40:16.320 --> 40:26.600
 We are biological meat vehicles, we're way overly attached to them.

40:26.600 --> 40:30.160
 Maybe especially with genetics and all those kinds of things, or artificial intelligence,

40:30.160 --> 40:35.960
 or living more and more in virtual worlds, will become detached from that kind of idea.

40:35.960 --> 40:45.080
 So for example, if I can clone you, make one million robbers, but you'll all have the

40:45.080 --> 40:50.520
 same idea, what is your real value, like I could just shoot you, and there will still

40:50.520 --> 40:56.760
 be 999 of you, but the idea is the important thing, the things you believe.

40:56.760 --> 41:02.520
 I would argue that I don't know, even if you clone someone perfectly, I don't think you

41:02.520 --> 41:09.120
 can reproduce the individual themselves, because we're all a product of nature and nurture.

41:09.120 --> 41:14.600
 So my particular concourse of experience is the path dependence that I represent cannot

41:14.600 --> 41:17.680
 be replicated, nor can anyone's for that matter.

41:17.680 --> 41:19.320
 Well, that's a hypothesis.

41:19.320 --> 41:31.040
 So that's of course a human meat bag would say, like desperately trying to preserve

41:31.040 --> 41:33.040
 himself.

41:33.040 --> 41:36.920
 I think it reduces to some fundamental questions about what is consciousness and whether that

41:36.920 --> 41:39.280
 can be cloned, all those kinds.

41:39.280 --> 41:42.480
 It gets to the core of what it is to be human.

41:42.480 --> 41:45.080
 What are the things that make you particularly you?

41:45.080 --> 41:49.880
 Yeah, I think it would assume kind of a materialist viewpoint on reality, and that if you could

41:49.880 --> 41:54.080
 reproduce every atom of an individual that you would have their experience encapsulated

41:54.080 --> 41:55.480
 in that.

41:55.480 --> 41:58.720
 And Hoffman's book is very radical.

41:58.720 --> 42:06.200
 He argues that space and time is not an objective reality, it's a biological interface.

42:06.200 --> 42:13.480
 So we are scanning our environment for fitness payoffs, and this space and time is the rendering

42:13.480 --> 42:19.080
 specific to human beings that allows us to navigate reality effectively.

42:19.080 --> 42:23.400
 So the further argument would be that we all have pretty similar interfaces, but they're

42:23.400 --> 42:27.520
 all slightly different too, because we're all adapting in different ways, and that different

42:27.520 --> 42:30.400
 animals have their own unique interfaces.

42:30.400 --> 42:34.880
 So we have a certain amount of photoreceptors in our eye, whereas I think the numbers three

42:34.880 --> 42:39.400
 might be five, or something like the mantis shrimp has like seven or nine.

42:39.400 --> 42:47.080
 So they can see, and we only see one 10 trillionth of the light spectrum.

42:47.080 --> 42:51.720
 So talk about a tiny fraction, I mean, one 10 trillionth is a very miniscule number,

42:51.720 --> 42:55.440
 and that makes up all of the light that we can interpret with our eyes.

42:55.440 --> 42:58.920
 But it's something like a mantis shrimp could see, you know, much more of that.

42:58.920 --> 43:06.760
 So I think there's this, we're very conditioned to have a fully materialist viewpoint on reality

43:06.760 --> 43:13.040
 today, or we think, you know, the atomic clockwork kind of universe.

43:13.040 --> 43:16.800
 But I think there's, I don't think that's true exactly.

43:16.800 --> 43:23.320
 And another school that goes into that is actually Austrian economics, where we could

43:23.320 --> 43:28.400
 say that, you know, we mentioned earlier that an asset is not property, it's actually based

43:28.400 --> 43:32.880
 on the relationship between the individual and the property.

43:32.880 --> 43:41.760
 There's this whole realm of relevance associated with, we're all moving through life in the

43:41.760 --> 43:43.680
 course of a goal directed action.

43:43.680 --> 43:50.280
 So when we walk across a room, I go from A to B, it's because I valued B more than A.

43:50.280 --> 43:53.160
 So value is inseparable from human action.

43:53.160 --> 43:57.840
 We have a rank ordered value system in our mind, each of us, and we're constantly taking

43:57.840 --> 44:01.840
 action in accordance with those rank values.

44:01.840 --> 44:07.400
 Anything that accelerates us on the course of our goal directed action towards our goal

44:07.400 --> 44:09.840
 is useful.

44:09.840 --> 44:14.480
 Anything that impedes us, or we could say is valuable, anything that impedes us is actually

44:14.480 --> 44:19.320
 obstructing to value and anything that's irrelevant is just valueless.

44:19.320 --> 44:26.120
 So this table that we're using right now, like this is a, it's an accessory to you and

44:26.120 --> 44:30.560
 I because it's holding this paper that's holding the information that's guiding our conversation.

44:30.560 --> 44:35.720
 But we could pay some $100 to jump over this table, and this table could simultaneously

44:35.720 --> 44:39.640
 be an accessory to you and I and an obstacle to someone else.

44:39.640 --> 44:45.160
 So it's this domain, this silent contention of willpower and agendas occurring across

44:45.160 --> 44:50.200
 the face of the earth that is what Austrian economics really looks at.

44:50.200 --> 44:55.680
 It's the realm of human action, as they call it, it's called praxeology.

44:55.680 --> 45:02.280
 So it's a non materialist viewpoint on reality and that things, we think in terms of matter

45:02.280 --> 45:07.800
 being reality, but it's often more so in the sphere of human action, what matters?

45:07.800 --> 45:08.800
 That is reality.

45:08.800 --> 45:12.520
 It's the relevance of a thing to the course of one's goal directed action.

45:12.520 --> 45:19.120
 And that's ultimately exist in the space of ideas, not in the space of physical matter.

45:19.120 --> 45:23.800
 And just to jump back to this line here, I think his fundamental line here is the question

45:23.800 --> 45:28.280
 is talking about universal Darwinism as an asset, what does it leave behind?

45:28.280 --> 45:32.320
 I've tried to show that once it passes through everything, we're left with stronger, sounder

45:32.320 --> 45:35.480
 versions of our most useful ideas.

45:35.480 --> 45:40.560
 That's the key point to me and that ideas and information so far as we can tell are

45:40.560 --> 45:44.480
 the most fundamental substrate of reality.

45:44.480 --> 45:50.480
 And information itself, back to entropy, information is the resolution of entropy.

45:50.480 --> 45:51.640
 That's what the bit is, right?

45:51.640 --> 45:52.720
 It's a one or zero.

45:52.720 --> 45:57.640
 Whatever reduces your entropy by half is a bit and we measure information in bits.

45:57.640 --> 46:00.000
 So you're right.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.240
 People don't have ideas, ideas have people.

46:03.240 --> 46:12.800
 Honestly, it's a really profound idea or a statement about reality, a reframing of reality.

46:12.800 --> 46:17.800
 So if we're actually being deeply honest about it, it's quite painful.

46:17.800 --> 46:23.840
 I do appreciate that you defended your biological meatback earlier, but it seems like ideas

46:23.840 --> 46:26.160
 are the things that have power.

46:26.160 --> 46:35.920
 That me, Lex, for example, is worthless and relative to the ideas that used my brain for

46:35.920 --> 46:37.760
 a bit of a time.

46:37.760 --> 46:42.480
 But so far as we know, only human beings can generate and share ideas.

46:42.480 --> 46:44.760
 So you can't say Lex is worthless.

46:44.760 --> 46:49.200
 You are the node of the idea sphere, the new sphere.

46:49.200 --> 46:52.160
 So what is it?

46:52.160 --> 46:57.280
 From a Bitcoin perspective, I'm like, I'm mining, I'm solving the cryptographic problem

46:57.280 --> 47:02.960
 in the general, in that sense, I'm a useful node.

47:02.960 --> 47:06.960
 Yeah, you're competing to solve the puzzle of entropy, right?

47:06.960 --> 47:09.920
 And when you do solve it, it benefits the entire network.

47:09.920 --> 47:16.760
 But I guess from my perspective, just because just working in AI, I'm looking at the long

47:16.760 --> 47:17.760
 term vision.

47:17.760 --> 47:24.880
 I see us humans in AI systems as really the same, and AI systems ultimately as something

47:24.880 --> 47:27.240
 that supersedes humans.

47:27.240 --> 47:33.440
 So what is intelligence?

47:33.440 --> 47:41.040
 So in the context of our current discussion, I think intelligence is very closely linked

47:41.040 --> 47:53.280
 to this notion of ideas and its ability to generate ideas, to mold ideas, to compress

47:53.280 --> 48:01.760
 seeming chaos into some model, into some theory that efficiently compresses the chaos in a

48:01.760 --> 48:06.240
 way where you can then integrate it with other ideas and they can play in all those kinds

48:06.240 --> 48:07.240
 of things.

48:07.240 --> 48:12.080
 So in that sense, it's the turning chaos into order.

48:12.080 --> 48:18.080
 It's the molding of ideas that our human brains can work with it.

48:18.080 --> 48:23.240
 And just from my perspective, I don't see any reason why they cannot be algorithmatized,

48:23.240 --> 48:25.560
 converted into computational systems.

48:25.560 --> 48:30.000
 I would agree, which is scary.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.440
 Very or potentially really promising, right?

48:33.440 --> 48:34.920
 It's kind of the case with all novelty.

48:34.920 --> 48:37.280
 It's terrifying as much as it is promising.

48:37.280 --> 48:39.440
 That's why you're pursuing it so heavily.

48:39.440 --> 48:45.680
 I would maybe take it a step further and say that intelligence, and maybe its most simplistic

48:45.680 --> 48:48.400
 form is error correction.

48:48.400 --> 48:56.560
 So we humans have wants, again, we're constantly expressing our value through action.

48:56.560 --> 48:58.080
 There's no other way to express it, by the way.

48:58.080 --> 49:02.480
 Whatever you choose to do in any moment, you are expressing the values you hold in your

49:02.480 --> 49:04.760
 mind and your heart.

49:04.760 --> 49:14.480
 As we move from less valued A to more valued B, entropy happens, uncertainty happens, we

49:14.480 --> 49:16.320
 fall off course.

49:16.320 --> 49:21.800
 And it is intelligence that enables us to render information from that experience and

49:21.800 --> 49:23.800
 error correct, right?

49:23.800 --> 49:30.960
 So that we can shift our trajectory slightly more towards B that we're trying to move towards.

49:30.960 --> 49:41.920
 So I think that there's something there that I don't know that we can make synthetically,

49:41.920 --> 49:47.720
 and that if we define intelligence as error correction, it's an error correction to what?

49:47.720 --> 49:50.680
 Error correction towards what we find is valuable.

49:50.680 --> 49:52.560
 So we're trying to satisfy human wants.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.200
 Why not just be our own, could be others as well.

49:54.200 --> 49:57.600
 If I'm an entrepreneur, I'm trying to solve the wants of others, not just myself.

49:57.600 --> 50:03.760
 And I'm trying to error correct myself towards that goal, using intelligence and processing

50:03.760 --> 50:06.640
 environmental feedback through intelligence to error correct.

50:06.640 --> 50:13.240
 So I don't know how, if you eliminate the human element completely, who's doing the

50:13.240 --> 50:14.240
 wanting?

50:14.240 --> 50:15.240
 Where does value come from?

50:15.240 --> 50:19.640
 I know the machine learning people who are listening are saying that's exactly what machine

50:19.640 --> 50:24.000
 learning is, which is error correction, because you have a loss function, objective function

50:24.000 --> 50:30.040
 that measures how wrong your thing is, and you want to make it less wrong next time.

50:30.040 --> 50:32.080
 That's the whole process of machine learning.

50:32.080 --> 50:41.400
 But you're saying what humans are able to do is in a world where there's no maybe objective

50:41.400 --> 50:47.600
 values, absolute values, you're generating that very loss function, that objective function

50:47.600 --> 50:55.400
 that measures the error comes from the human mind.

50:55.400 --> 50:59.560
 Some aliens might disagree with you, because they might have a different objective function.

50:59.560 --> 51:04.080
 Obviously, the purpose comes from consciousness, I think, and without purpose, there's not

51:04.080 --> 51:05.080
 error correction.

51:05.080 --> 51:06.080
 Yeah.

51:06.080 --> 51:09.640
 I mean, this is, again, a hypothesis, like where does purpose come from?

51:09.640 --> 51:13.480
 It seems to come from consciousness, you're right.

51:13.480 --> 51:19.120
 That's where suffering comes from, and you want to lessen suffering, that's where pleasure

51:19.120 --> 51:20.120
 comes from.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.120
 It seems like it's consciousness.

51:22.120 --> 51:25.240
 Maybe there's something to this biological meat bag.

51:25.240 --> 51:29.400
 So to take it one layer deeper on this, and the reason I like this book so much, again,

51:29.400 --> 51:35.520
 the case against reality, so he's making the case at space and time are not fundamental,

51:35.520 --> 51:40.240
 which I started my intellectual explorations in physics, actually astrophysics.

51:40.240 --> 51:45.360
 So for the longest time, even the way I describe money as I talk about space and time, so that

51:45.360 --> 51:46.760
 blew my mind.

51:46.760 --> 51:53.520
 But this dove told nicely with another book called Leela, the author is Robert Persig.

51:53.520 --> 51:56.960
 So he wrote Zen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which is a very popular book.

51:56.960 --> 52:01.760
 20 years later, he wrote Leela, which no one's heard of, which is crazy, and he basically

52:01.760 --> 52:06.960
 says he was wrong about his first book, and he lays out this entire other metaphysics

52:06.960 --> 52:08.960
 of quality, he calls it.

52:08.960 --> 52:12.680
 So it's the metaphysics, I think it's the metaphysics of quality.

52:12.680 --> 52:19.160
 But his supposition is that it's not physical reality that's fundamental.

52:19.160 --> 52:22.360
 It's not informational information that's fundamental.

52:22.360 --> 52:24.360
 It's value.

52:24.360 --> 52:29.280
 So he actually, and it's a beautiful book, I highly recommend it.

52:29.280 --> 52:33.280
 He essentially is refuting causality itself.

52:33.280 --> 52:43.120
 We think A causes B, this book makes the case that B values precondition A, so that we are

52:43.120 --> 52:48.600
 actually creating our future through our value systems.

52:48.600 --> 52:53.760
 And this goes back to something, I think the Solzhenitsyn said this, that the line between

52:53.760 --> 52:56.360
 good and evil runs down the heart of every man.

52:56.360 --> 53:02.440
 So it's as if our moral decisions are actually what's creating the outcomes in reality over

53:02.440 --> 53:03.440
 time.

53:03.440 --> 53:07.360
 And then that gets into all the wisdom traditions related to religion, or it's always talking

53:07.360 --> 53:13.840
 about loving thy neighbor and loving God and all of these other things that are good morally

53:13.840 --> 53:15.360
 to create the best outcomes.

53:15.360 --> 53:18.480
 So values are fundamental.

53:18.480 --> 53:19.480
 Value, yes.

53:19.480 --> 53:21.480
 Value is fundamental.

53:21.480 --> 53:27.040
 Oh boy, yeah, that's interesting.

53:27.040 --> 53:31.280
 It does feel like physics is not capturing something.

53:31.280 --> 53:38.280
 There's some people, panpsychists argue that consciousness might be one of the fundamental

53:38.280 --> 53:42.880
 properties of nature, like from which emerges everything we see.

53:42.880 --> 53:49.560
 So that could be just other words for this same notion of value.

53:49.560 --> 53:54.120
 And then the basic laws of physics are not capturing that currently.

53:54.120 --> 53:58.520
 So maybe humans, in order to understand from where humans came from, we have to understand

53:58.520 --> 54:03.640
 these other properties of nature, which are yet to be discovered at the physics level.

54:03.640 --> 54:10.840
 And we contend with that underlying nature, whatever it is, with the logos.

54:10.840 --> 54:18.600
 So we're looking at uncategorized nature, and then we're assigning a word to it.

54:18.600 --> 54:24.520
 So we're slicing up chaos into little boxes of order, and then we're establishing this

54:24.520 --> 54:30.920
 social consensus as to those labels, which we call words, and we're using that to communicate.

54:30.920 --> 54:35.200
 And when we communicate, we can start to build these other things.

54:35.200 --> 54:38.120
 This is like the Yuval Harari imagined orders.

54:38.120 --> 54:44.320
 So we can create these useful fictions, whether it's the nation state or human rights or money,

54:44.320 --> 54:49.760
 and that allows us to cooperate flexibly in large numbers so that we can better contend

54:49.760 --> 54:50.760
 with reality.

54:50.760 --> 54:54.160
 We can produce more complicated things.

54:54.160 --> 54:58.640
 We can enlarge that bubble of civilization against entropy.

54:58.640 --> 55:01.240
 And that's what capitalism is all about.

55:01.240 --> 55:08.840
 It's about further specializing knowledge, further enriching mankind's treasury of knowledge,

55:08.840 --> 55:09.840
 and doing it.

55:09.840 --> 55:15.640
 But to do that, the communication media that we're using, the words have to have stable

55:15.640 --> 55:16.800
 meaning.

55:16.800 --> 55:21.560
 The money needs to have value that's dependable.

55:21.560 --> 55:27.080
 It needs to be something that's not dictated by any one group.

55:27.080 --> 55:30.920
 It's reached by consensus of the entire group.

55:30.920 --> 55:38.680
 That's how you think it's optimizing for error correction, again, where a free market would

55:38.680 --> 55:42.640
 be harnessing the intelligence of all market actors.

55:42.640 --> 55:48.280
 And a centrally planned market would be harnessing just the intelligence of a small group of

55:48.280 --> 55:49.280
 bureaucrats.

55:49.280 --> 55:53.440
 And it's not obvious how to achieve this kind of consensus mechanism.

55:53.440 --> 55:58.440
 I mean, there's obviously, we'll talk about sort of Bitcoin as an idea.

55:58.440 --> 56:03.000
 Ultimately the idea of Bitcoin is connecting it to physics.

56:03.000 --> 56:09.440
 So you can trust that physical matter won't change.

56:09.440 --> 56:14.920
 But there could be other ideas that were yet, maybe physics could be changed.

56:14.920 --> 56:18.840
 Eric Weinstein has anything to say about it.

56:18.840 --> 56:23.200
 We right now believe that physics can't be changed, the physical matter of the world,

56:23.200 --> 56:26.520
 but maybe it can in a way that we're totally not understanding.

56:26.520 --> 56:32.680
 You mentioned sort of reality from Donald Hoffman's perspective.

56:32.680 --> 56:39.040
 If we don't have even close to direct access to the fabric of reality, maybe we're living

56:39.040 --> 56:44.320
 in a world that's very many dimensions, that the notions of space and time is just like

56:44.320 --> 56:48.920
 a silly, useful construct that's not at all connected.

56:48.920 --> 56:53.040
 You're starting to look at like Stephen Wolfram's, I don't know if you're familiar with this

56:53.040 --> 56:58.040
 view of the world, that it's like hypographs underneath it all, like these mathematical

56:58.040 --> 57:05.800
 structures from which everything emerges, like they're like many, many, many orders

57:05.800 --> 57:11.800
 of magnitude smaller than what we think of as they're even smaller than like strings

57:11.800 --> 57:13.320
 and string theory.

57:13.320 --> 57:17.560
 So those are the basic mathematical objects from which it emerges.

57:17.560 --> 57:20.680
 I think that's an interesting philosophical framework.

57:20.680 --> 57:27.480
 It's also, people should check out, a cool way to play with beautiful hypograph mathematical

57:27.480 --> 57:28.480
 structures.

57:28.480 --> 57:33.560
 I don't know if you know what Stephen Wolfram is, but he created Wolfram Alpha and all these

57:33.560 --> 57:36.200
 tools that you can actually visualize and play with.

57:36.200 --> 57:43.800
 So you can play with physics in a visual way, or at least discrete mathematics, which I

57:43.800 --> 57:44.800
 think is incredible.

57:44.800 --> 57:46.960
 He doesn't get enough love.

57:46.960 --> 57:52.560
 One of the reasons he I think doesn't get enough love is because of this little quirk

57:52.560 --> 57:55.840
 of human nature, which is the ego.

57:55.840 --> 58:05.920
 And he sometimes frustrates a few folks because he's very, let's say, proud of his work.

58:05.920 --> 58:13.640
 But it's interesting to think about a world where we don't have direct access to reality,

58:13.640 --> 58:15.200
 as Hoffman argues.

58:15.200 --> 58:18.920
 And maybe, I don't know if you can comment, I don't know if you're familiar with Ein Rand's

58:18.920 --> 58:26.480
 work and her whole philosophy of objectivism, where her whole contention is that we do have

58:26.480 --> 58:27.480
 access.

58:27.480 --> 58:39.680
 I don't want to misstate it, but at least she will claim that it's not useful, or I

58:39.680 --> 58:44.280
 think she'll probably say it's not correct to argue that we don't have access to reality.

58:44.280 --> 58:46.120
 We have the hence objectivism.

58:46.120 --> 58:49.280
 We have direct access to reality.

58:49.280 --> 58:52.480
 That's the only thing we can reason about.

58:52.480 --> 58:58.280
 And the only way to live life morally is to reason through everything, starting with the

58:58.280 --> 59:01.320
 axioms of reality, which we do have direct access to.

59:01.320 --> 59:02.320
 Right.

59:02.320 --> 59:04.520
 You have thoughts about her work?

59:04.520 --> 59:09.000
 I am slightly ashamed to say I have not read Ein Rand yet.

59:09.000 --> 59:14.240
 So she is high on my list, and she's been recommended a number of times.

59:14.240 --> 59:18.320
 But so I don't know a lot specifically about her philosophy or objectivism.

59:18.320 --> 59:25.840
 But to me, it resonates closely with what the American pragmatist commented on truth,

59:25.840 --> 59:30.480
 and they distinguished what you could say is absolute truth, which is at the bottom

59:30.480 --> 59:35.080
 of reality, whether it's Mr. Wolfram's mathematical formulas or value, whatever it may be.

59:35.080 --> 59:42.400
 It's something ineffable, something beyond the reach of epistemology, perhaps even.

59:42.400 --> 59:45.520
 And maybe that's why religion just sort of points to it.

59:45.520 --> 59:55.640
 Just trying to use, I think, Joseph Campbell said something like, religion is using stories

59:55.640 --> 1:00:01.320
 to point towards the same transcendental mystery we all experience but cannot articulate.

1:00:01.320 --> 1:00:08.360
 So something like the artist uses lies to point to the truth, something like that kind

1:00:08.360 --> 1:00:10.360
 of thing.

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:11.360
 That's really good.

1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:16.360
 The American pragmatist said that, because at the end of the day, this is all about when

1:00:16.360 --> 1:00:24.600
 we say truth, we need something that is socially close to social consensus and is not shakeable

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:26.080
 by political action.

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:28.800
 So that's what physics and mathematics are.

1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:35.240
 It's an unshakable point of reference, I guess you might say.

1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:42.840
 So the American pragmatist defined truth as the end of inquiry.

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:50.640
 And in markets, we could say that the market itself is a forum that generates truth.

1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:55.160
 We call this pragmatic truth to separate pure objective truth that we can't even talk about

1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:59.440
 without polluting it versus pragmatic truth, which is something that's useful.

1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:06.320
 So the example here would be, if I give you a map and you're trying to go from your house

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:12.480
 to the local brisket restaurant and the map gets you from your house to the brisket restaurant,

1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:16.800
 is that because the map is true or is that because the map is useful?

1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:21.640
 They're very hard to disentangle when you're just looking at it pragmatically.

1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:26.640
 And in markets, markets, I argue, generate three forms of pragmatic truth.

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:28.560
 One is the price.

1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:36.280
 So this is the collective subjective demand and purchasing power of humanity running up

1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:41.920
 against the objective supply of capital and resources in the marketplace.

1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:44.440
 So there's demand overlaid on supply.

1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:46.200
 The result of that is the price.

1:01:46.200 --> 1:01:53.080
 So that is the most truthful exchange ratio, which is the closest approximation to the

1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:56.200
 value of any good in the marketplace.

1:01:56.200 --> 1:01:58.760
 So it gives us a data point on which we can operate.

1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:03.960
 It's compressing all known market realities down into a single actionable number.

1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:07.840
 You know, based on the price of bread or copper, whether you want to buy more of it, you want

1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:11.520
 to abstain from buying it, or maybe you want to try and find substitutes.

1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:16.160
 And you can think of that price signal, it's like an economic nerve signal that's coordinating

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:17.720
 human action across time.

1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:24.720
 So if we're one socioeconomic superorganism or collective, the price signal is the nerve.

1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:28.480
 And that's the first form of pragmatic truth that markets generate.

1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:32.440
 The second form would be tools and innovations themselves.

1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:35.760
 So entrepreneurs are experimenting across time.

1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:38.120
 They're trying to satisfy the wants of consumers.

1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:40.800
 Consumers are sovereign in the marketplace.

1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:43.920
 Whatever the consumer wants, the consumer gets, right?

1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:44.920
 I'm trying to satisfy that.

1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:46.560
 I'm trying to do it at a profit.

1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:50.680
 So I'm trying to take viewing the existing price signals of goods in the marketplace.

1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:56.600
 I'm trying to assemble those in a way at a cost lower than the final solution I'm delivering

1:02:56.600 --> 1:02:57.600
 to my customer.

1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:03.040
 I'm selling it at a price higher than the productive factors I combine to create it.

1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:09.400
 And in that iterative process, we're constantly discovering new and better ways of solving

1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:11.520
 problems or satisfying wants.

1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:17.280
 So we could say, to go out and dig a hole, right, someone wants a hole dug, that a shovel

1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:22.560
 is going to let you do it much faster per hour than you would with your bare hands.

1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:26.400
 So what is the pragmatic truth of digging holes?

1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:28.600
 It's a shovel, right?

1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:33.960
 It's the best way we know how to solve any particular problem based on the existing treasury

1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:35.440
 of knowledge.

1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:39.160
 So every tool, again, we're back to ideas being fundamental.

1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:43.080
 The shovel itself is just a knowledge structure.

1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:47.720
 We've figured out a way to create this particular implement and then we've indexed the raw materials

1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:52.320
 we found in nature to this knowledge structure to create a shovel, which allows us to better

1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:57.240
 satisfy human wants, faster, cheaper, better, effectively.

1:03:57.240 --> 1:04:02.040
 I'm trying to generalize, you blow my mind a little bit here, I'm trying to generalize

1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:08.760
 the idea of tool, how to think about it, because I keep just, when you say tool, I keep imagining

1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:12.200
 different like specific concentrations of a tool.

1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:22.320
 I'm trying to see, so the price is a pragmatic truth that's communicating value in this network.

1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:27.240
 Subjective demands against objective supply.

1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:30.040
 So it's an economic democracy.

1:04:30.040 --> 1:04:32.400
 So that's the demand supply.

1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:38.800
 And then the tools are the ways of extracting or solving problems is the more general kind

1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:39.800
 of thing.

1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:41.400
 Or satisfying wants.

1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:48.200
 So wants are somehow, that's part of the supply and the demand.

1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:51.680
 And wants are back to value, right, because everything someone wants, they're expressing

1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:52.680
 their value.

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:53.680
 Okay.

1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:54.680
 Yeah.

1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:57.520
 So the shovel is a pragmatic truth.

1:04:57.520 --> 1:04:58.520
 The shovel is truth.

1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:00.200
 It feels like a good book title.

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:01.200
 Okay.

1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:02.200
 Sorry.

1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:03.200
 So what other pragm...

1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:07.880
 And then the third one I would argue is virtue, actually.

1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:09.200
 Oh, wow.

1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:15.720
 And another way to maybe think about this is competitive competency, but it's also cooperative

1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:17.320
 competency.

1:05:17.320 --> 1:05:25.120
 So we're learning over time what characteristics, what patterns of action, what mindsets, what

1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:30.760
 mental tools, what heuristics are most useful to satisfying customer wants.

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:34.480
 So I think that becomes, over time, becomes sharpened into virtue, right?

1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:39.400
 We know it's best to be honest because if you lie, it's very energy inefficient, right?

1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:41.840
 You're creating this little fork of reality.

1:05:41.840 --> 1:05:45.280
 And then if someone else asks you about that lie again, you have to put another layer of

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:46.280
 lies on top of it.

1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:49.400
 Where if you just tell the truth, you're just recollecting what happened.

1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:55.680
 And so that sort of keeps, again, when we're talking about delaying volatility, right?

1:05:55.680 --> 1:06:00.840
 If you lie, you're delaying short term volatility, but you're increasing long term volatility.

1:06:00.840 --> 1:06:01.840
 What about murder?

1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:05.520
 I'm being able to figure out why murder is bad because I just keep wanting to murder

1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:07.280
 people.

1:06:07.280 --> 1:06:08.280
 And I've murdered many.

1:06:08.280 --> 1:06:13.480
 Well, that's why I'm trying to get an interview with Vladimir Putin.

1:06:13.480 --> 1:06:18.800
 So that's fascinating virtue in this market with the supplies and demands, and there's

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:21.800
 the tools, which is also a pragmatic truth.

1:06:21.800 --> 1:06:22.800
 And there's virtue.

1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:24.600
 It's a pragmatic truth.

1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:25.600
 Yeah.

1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:30.240
 And if we interfere with that free market process, again, if we overstep, which this

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:36.120
 maybe ties into murder, if you start to be coercive against life, liberty or property.

1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:41.280
 So if you're forcibly taking someone's life, you're breaking down the trust in that market

1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:44.200
 that generates these pragmatic truths.

1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:51.560
 If you forcibly infringe on someone's liberty, for any reason other than them originally

1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:57.000
 breaking or infringing on life, liberty or property, then that's not going to work either.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:01.280
 And then if you violate private property rights, if you steal property from others, you're

1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:09.280
 breaking down the trust that the intersubjective fabric of money and markets and the rule of

1:07:09.280 --> 1:07:13.760
 law, all of these useful fictions are meant to preserve, you're corrupting it and breaking

1:07:13.760 --> 1:07:14.760
 it down.

1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:20.800
 What's kind of interesting to think about the market is helping evolve the virtues.

1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:23.120
 It's sharpened into virtues.

1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:30.520
 And these virtues can then go into motivational posters or in books that we all agree on and

1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:35.440
 then eventually take for granted as if they were somehow fundamental to human nature.

1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:40.560
 But they're not perhaps fundamental, they're just pragmatic truths.

1:07:40.560 --> 1:07:41.560
 Yeah.

1:07:41.560 --> 1:07:48.520
 It's another way to consider competition itself is that it is a discovery process.

1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:56.040
 So entrepreneurs are competing with one another and they're trying to best satisfy consumer

1:07:56.040 --> 1:07:57.880
 wants at the lowest possible price.

1:07:57.880 --> 1:08:02.280
 So they're placing bets of time, energy and capital on themselves, on their idea, their

1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:04.160
 business plan.

1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:10.440
 And then the market decides, the consensus of market actors decide which one was better.

1:08:10.440 --> 1:08:13.000
 One lives, one dies.

1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:18.160
 So competition itself is helping us get closer to truth, to pragmatic truth.

1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:21.480
 So we're discovering what is the right price for this asset.

1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:26.840
 And that price, by the way, is derived, again, in the sense of data compression.

1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:29.160
 Everyone in the world can see that price.

1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:33.120
 Everyone in the world can then put their skin in the game by choosing to buy or sell or

1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:38.360
 short or go long or do any number of financial actions on that price.

1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:41.320
 And that information is then propagated back out to everyone else.

1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:48.760
 So it's this feedback loop between market actor and price that makes it so useful.

1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:52.600
 And that's what carries us.

1:08:52.600 --> 1:09:00.000
 So it's these collisions of interest that carry us, it removes the unuseful aspects

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:05.560
 of ourselves or of our tools or of a price and reveals pragmatic truth to us.

1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:11.600
 Can you play my therapist for a second and if we talk about creative destruction, I think

1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:21.560
 Bukowski, Hunter Stompson is a quote, something like, for all instances of beauty, many souls

1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:23.840
 must be trampled.

1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:27.600
 Wow.

1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:34.480
 But it, there does seem to be an aspect of competition that destroys.

1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:41.320
 You were talking about entrepreneurs sort of on the outside of the circle of order striving

1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:49.480
 to make sense, to compress volatility of the chaos of the universe.

1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:55.600
 Is there some way to protect a little bit against the pain of that destruction or that

1:09:55.600 --> 1:10:03.760
 creative destruction that entrepreneurs screaming on fire as he enlightens the rest of us?

1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:10.480
 Is there some role for us humans together in the togetherness of it?

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:18.080
 Also government, but any kind of collectives in helping that entrepreneur who's on fire

1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:26.480
 to maybe after a few minutes to spray him with some water and put him out of his misery?

1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:34.720
 I would say that pain is the inarguable basis of being.

1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:45.000
 Pain is, no matter how you try to explain it away or describe it, it's not something

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.120
 you can rationalize away.

1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:53.240
 No one, I think, ever, someone may want to cut themselves to have an endorphin high,

1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:55.120
 but no one wants to suffer, we'd say.

1:10:55.120 --> 1:11:02.560
 So pain, in that sense, it is what we're constantly trying to deal with and to move

1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:08.680
 away from or create buffers between us and potential pain or potential uncertainty.

1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:12.000
 And that pain is information.

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.840
 When we experience something that is misfit to the outcome we desired, that pain is what

1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:25.080
 puts us, it encourages us to change our trajectory, to get back on course towards our valued aim.

1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:33.000
 So as far as you need entrepreneurs that are exploring and you're trying to do something

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:37.080
 new, if you're a pioneer of any kind, you are courageously facing pain.

1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:38.960
 You're willfully confronting it.

1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:41.560
 So I don't think it's avoidable in that sense.

1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:47.360
 It's not like we can have pain free economic growth like the central bank would maybe have

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:51.800
 us lend to believe that we can just run these experiments and when they fail, we'll just

1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:56.920
 paper over all the losses and continue or you're just delaying and exacerbating the

1:11:56.920 --> 1:12:00.520
 inevitable volatility back to reality.

1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:06.520
 But what I would say is that capitalism, because we're building, we're increasing the capital

1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:09.960
 stock of the world, which again, capital is the mitigation of risk.

1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:14.720
 So we're reducing the overall risk of existence by accumulating more capital in the world.

1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:18.960
 And that's what protects that entrepreneur that's deciding, hey, I saved up a million

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:24.200
 bucks, I'm gonna go try this business idea, I'm gonna put all my money on the line.

1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:28.960
 And if he goes up in flames, then his cost of living when he comes back to reality and

1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:33.160
 he's starting over from zero, his cost of living is substantially lower, starting over

1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:37.040
 from zero than he would be out in the wilderness on his own.

1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:43.520
 So it's the accumulation of capital stock is the buffer against uncertainty for everyone.

1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:50.200
 And it gives you actually more potential to go out and experiment, to go out and confront

1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:55.080
 the chaos of nature because you are better healed effectively.

1:12:55.080 --> 1:13:03.200
 So I think we're speaking in sort of idealistic terms about the power of capitalism when it

1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:04.840
 works well.

1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:11.600
 Is there any aspects that you think that don't work well in a free market in all the basic

1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:17.040
 pragmatic truths that we were talking about, is there ways it can go wrong?

1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:28.640
 So I would first argue that we have never seen an actual purely free market.

1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:36.760
 Closest example would be kind of geopolitically we have a free market and that governments

1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:47.560
 are not necessarily governed, but they are premised on governing large groups of individuals.

1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:50.040
 So that's not, doesn't exactly.

1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:52.400
 You mean between governments?

1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:53.400
 Yes.

1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:58.640
 See, but isn't there still, so a free market, maybe you can correct me, is a free market

1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:04.040
 still grounded in the ideas of property rights and all those kinds of things, right?

1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:07.640
 So governments tend to also sometimes be violent towards each other.

1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:08.640
 That's right.

1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:11.880
 So they don't respect all the basic aspects of capitalism.

1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:12.880
 That's right.

1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:18.920
 So maybe another way to look at this is that gold is the original governor of government

1:14:18.920 --> 1:14:20.960
 actually.

1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:27.080
 And this is the reason governments have abused and gone off of the gold standard.

1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:38.040
 So historically, if you are a bank or a nation state and you produce more currency than your

1:14:38.040 --> 1:14:44.200
 gold reserves can justify, then people, then gold will flow out of your bank or out of

1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:45.200
 your country.

1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:54.040
 So there's this natural check via the money that, via capitalistic money, which is gold,

1:14:54.040 --> 1:14:55.040
 right?

1:14:55.040 --> 1:14:56.040
 Gold was selected by the free market.

1:14:56.040 --> 1:14:58.760
 It's not decreed by government.

1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:02.600
 It provided this natural check on government action.

1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:12.080
 So I guess to get back to the original question is we've never seen a pure free market because

1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:18.040
 money has always been monopolized and coerced, frankly.

1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:23.040
 So to try and answer what goes wrong with a free market is really difficult because we've

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:24.680
 never actually seen it.

1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:31.720
 And I would define free market is one in which government only protects life, liberty and

1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:32.720
 property.

1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:38.920
 And so that's a very minimal role in society, again, just as a network security for the

1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:41.080
 economic trade network.

1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:47.320
 And anything that, any government function that goes beyond those three core functions,

1:15:47.320 --> 1:15:50.520
 which by the way are pretty much the core tenants of morality as well.

1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:56.160
 So governments just really intended to preserve natural law, if you will.

1:15:56.160 --> 1:16:01.560
 Anything that goes beyond that moves us closer to an unfree market.

1:16:01.560 --> 1:16:10.720
 So every regulation, every act of coercion is actually a gradation closer to a purely

1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:13.240
 unfree market, which would be a monopoly.

1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:17.800
 So in terms of what I guess theoretically we could say goes wrong in the free market

1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:27.640
 is that it's volatile, it's trading off, it's accepting short term volatility in exchange

1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:30.640
 for less long run volatility.

1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:32.980
 And this tends to be the way of nature, by the way.

1:16:32.980 --> 1:16:40.960
 So if we could look at something like, there's a region in North America called Baja, California,

1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:45.560
 and it runs into the United States and it runs down into Mexico as well.

1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:50.600
 So the same topology, but two different jurisdictions.

1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:58.040
 In the U.S., we very heavily manage forest fires, we're trying to manage nature effectively,

1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:00.120
 whereas in Mexico, it's much more unregulated.

1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:04.440
 It just, when wildfires spring up, they let them burn off.

1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:08.280
 North America, when wildfires spring up, we're actually extinguishing them.

1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:12.360
 So we're constantly trying to dampen the short run volatility of these small brush fires,

1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:15.040
 whereas in Mexico, we just let them burn, we let nature do its thing.

1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:16.040
 Yeah.

1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:21.200
 The consequence of this is that the wildfires still occur eventually, but they're much larger

1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:25.680
 and much more devastating in North America, where human intervention has occurred.

1:17:25.680 --> 1:17:32.880
 Because it is, it's dampening nature's natural corrective mechanism of clearing this underbrush

1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:38.080
 with these more frequent and smaller fires at the cost of much larger fires.

1:17:38.080 --> 1:17:43.040
 So again, we're delaying short term volatility and exacerbating long run volatility.

1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:47.920
 And in Mexico, it's the opposite, just these wildfires burn much smaller and more continuously

1:17:47.920 --> 1:17:49.440
 over time.

1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:53.120
 The further effect of that in North America is that the fires can get so big and so hot

1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:55.200
 that it burns away the top soil.

1:17:55.200 --> 1:17:58.560
 So it actually destroys the fertility of the soil itself.

1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:06.480
 So the point of this is that human intervention, even the intention behind North American authorities

1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:10.400
 managing that forest fire is to create less destruction.

1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:12.040
 That is the intention.

1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:15.480
 And the intention is divergent from the outcome.

1:18:15.480 --> 1:18:22.240
 So in Telemion speak, he would say that human intervention moves us from mediocristan into

1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:24.080
 extremistan.

1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:28.680
 So mediocristan would be something much more like nature where, for instance, you can't

1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:33.840
 double your body weight in a day, probably can't even do it in a year, right?

1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:40.440
 But in extremistan, which is something much more information based, you can double or

1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:44.880
 send your net worth to zero in a single trade, in a single moment, right?

1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:50.720
 So when we try and intervene with natural biological systems that have these feedback

1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:57.520
 loops, we actually start to push the system to behave more like an extremist system that

1:18:57.520 --> 1:19:03.720
 has less short run volatility, but more extreme long run volatility.

1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:10.240
 But the question is, where you look at capitalism or communism, for example, and by the way,

1:19:10.240 --> 1:19:14.720
 yes, I will talk to somebody who's a Marxist or a communist, like Richard Wolfe is a pretty

1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:20.000
 eloquent defender of these ideas, because it's always good to really understand ideas,

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:24.200
 as opposed to just reject them offhand.

1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:31.000
 When you look at the system of capitalism or the system of communism, there's ideals,

1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:35.800
 and a lot of people argue in this perfect form would actually be good for the world.

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:42.560
 The question is, how resilient are they to the corruption of human nature?

1:19:42.560 --> 1:19:48.800
 And I mean, you're saying that there's never been a free market, it's a very true statement.

1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:54.600
 The question is, how resilient is capitalism, or whatever implementations of capitalism

1:19:54.600 --> 1:20:01.760
 we had up to this point, to human nature where one person will become successful through

1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:07.240
 legitimate means, then starts to try to manipulate the system that takes it away from a free

1:20:07.240 --> 1:20:14.200
 market, or takes it away from the things that gave them the riches in the first place,

1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:19.760
 and then try to, through corruption, get more, get this, the thing you said, the lazy human

1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:20.760
 ways.

1:20:20.760 --> 1:20:23.200
 Now, I try to figure out how to get something for nothing.

1:20:23.200 --> 1:20:24.200
 That's right.

1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:27.480
 So, how resilient do you think is capitalism to that?

1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:35.760
 Well, the best implementation we've had of it really has been the United States, I think,

1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:42.520
 up until this point, but it's still the central banking itself.

1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:46.040
 This was in the 1848 manifesto of the Communist Party.

1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:51.080
 Measure number five reads, an exclusive state monopoly in centralized control over cash

1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:52.080
 and credit.

1:20:52.080 --> 1:20:56.040
 So, the central bank is a Marxist or communist institution.

1:20:56.040 --> 1:21:00.720
 It is antithetical to the free market principles on which the United States was founded.

1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:03.880
 And indeed, the United States resisted the implementation of a central bank.

1:21:03.880 --> 1:21:06.480
 I think it was Andrew Jackson.

1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:11.000
 I know there was the first national bank, the second national bank were both disbanded,

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:16.760
 and then Andrew Jackson, which is my favorite Tennessean, he has some famous quotes about

1:21:16.760 --> 1:21:19.520
 routing out the bankers like a Den of Vipers.

1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:23.240
 I think he punched one of the central bankers in the face.

1:21:23.240 --> 1:21:29.120
 Back when our leaders were a bit more badass, like you might say.

1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:38.560
 And finally in 1913, the Federal Reserve was implemented, and it's been kind of all downhill

1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:39.560
 from there.

1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:40.560
 So, what is...

1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:41.560
 Can you...

1:21:41.560 --> 1:21:42.560
 Oh, second.

1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:48.760
 I was just going to say that communism and capitalism, it's also a matter of scale.

1:21:48.760 --> 1:21:53.640
 The ideal behind communism is from each according to their ability to each according to their

1:21:53.640 --> 1:21:54.640
 need.

1:21:54.640 --> 1:21:55.640
 Sounds beautiful, right?

1:21:55.640 --> 1:22:00.120
 It sounds like a great, peaceful, harmonious way to organize ourselves.

1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:05.520
 The problem is, and by the way, I am a communist in my family, in my home, right?

1:22:05.520 --> 1:22:07.200
 At that very small scale.

1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:08.200
 Yes.

1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:14.160
 In your very small circles of trust, you're much more likely to behave selflessly towards

1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:15.160
 one another.

1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:20.440
 Okay, I look forward to the Bitcoin community clipping out that part, saying that Robert

1:22:20.440 --> 1:22:23.960
 Breedlove is a communist and the ideals of communism are beautiful.

1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:26.240
 Yeah, context matters, people.

1:22:26.240 --> 1:22:29.640
 Sorry, go ahead.

1:22:29.640 --> 1:22:33.240
 But to your point, it does not scale, right?

1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:42.280
 As we move into this larger system of socioeconomic cooperation, which is necessary to deepen the

1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:45.000
 division of labor, to generate more wealth, right?

1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:52.320
 We need to interact with one another on much larger scales than this communist utopian ideal.

1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:59.600
 We get into the realm of capitalism, where we need really sound rules, hard rules, consensus,

1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:06.960
 verifiability, and frankly, prices, because the other thing in Soviet Russia is they tried

1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:14.440
 to replace the profit motive or the price signal with this nationalistic faith and

1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:18.400
 devotion, where it's like, you don't need self interest anymore.

1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:20.400
 You don't need prices or profits.

1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:26.560
 You can just protect Mother Russia and serve Mother Russia, and that would create wealth.

1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:28.120
 And what happened?

1:23:28.120 --> 1:23:29.880
 They destroyed price signals.

1:23:29.880 --> 1:23:30.880
 There were shortages.

1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:32.360
 There were famines.

1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:36.160
 There's all levels of corruption.

1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:42.640
 Because to your point, it's once you, people have to run the system no matter what.

1:23:42.640 --> 1:23:46.640
 So when people are always pursuing something for nothing, and you put someone in a seat

1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:52.280
 of much closer to absolute power, where they're making all the pricing decisions, they own

1:23:52.280 --> 1:23:57.920
 all of the productive factors in the economy, they're not beholden to any market force.

1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:04.920
 There's no market check on their action that that institution tends to become more corrupt.

1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:10.680
 And further, it's an inferior resource strategy.

1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:15.400
 I alluded to this earlier, where the other way to think about free market versus central

1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:22.960
 planning is its decentralized or distributed computing versus centralized computing.

1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:29.640
 So each one of us, I think that the number is 120 bits per second of active awareness.

1:24:29.640 --> 1:24:33.160
 So we can take in, clearly we process a lot more than that, but our active awareness,

1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:37.680
 I think is 120 bits per second.

1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:42.160
 In a centralized planning body like in Soviet Russia, they had the pricing czar, maybe they

1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:46.240
 had 10, 20,000 people deciding the prices for the entire country.

1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:52.520
 You're only getting that much data throughput, 20,000 people times 120 bits per second.

1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:57.640
 Whereas in a free market, if everyone is free to interact with deep capital markets based

1:24:57.640 --> 1:25:02.480
 on an accurate price, you're getting the data throughput of 120 bits per second times the

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:04.560
 entire economy.

1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:11.960
 So you're getting, it's a more efficient means for disseminating knowledge effectively.

1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:17.360
 And then again, knowledge is just the more knowledge socioeconomic structure can contain,

1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:21.960
 the more wealthy it is, prices, tools, all these things are just knowledge.

1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:30.040
 So in that respect, that's why something like capitalism, even in its marginalized form,

1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:33.600
 state capitalism outcompetes communism.

1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:38.360
 It's distributed computing versus centralized computer.

1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:45.040
 You know, we kind of brought up religion and Joseph Campbell and myth and the propagation

1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:46.040
 of ideas.

1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:50.680
 And kind of, before I forget, I wanted to ask your thoughts about this.

1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:56.920
 You know, Jordan Peterson, I haven't really understood exactly, like be able to pin him

1:25:56.920 --> 1:26:03.960
 down exactly what he sees as the role of religion in human society.

1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:11.560
 But it feels like he's describing it as having value for us.

1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:15.800
 This, the ideas of myth are valuable.

1:26:15.800 --> 1:26:21.880
 They're valuable mechanisms toward, I think you mentioned kind of directing us in this

1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:25.320
 world as a human society.

1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:30.040
 Do you think about myth, do you think about religion, what's the use of it in this construct

1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:42.400
 of markets in this framework of where ideas are ultimately the fundamental thing that

1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:44.080
 makes societies work?

1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:45.080
 Yeah.

1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:53.120
 I think Jordan Peterson, who I'm a huge fan of, he's been very influential in my thinking

1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:58.720
 and influential on my own religious views as well.

1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:08.160
 I think his position would be, and he said this before, that he acts as if God exists.

1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:14.480
 And I've had some arguments about this before, but to me, that points towards the preeminence

1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:21.720
 of action and how important action is versus your cognitive beliefs necessarily.

1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:26.280
 And I think there is a lot of utility in that, that if you follow the moral code of something

1:27:26.280 --> 1:27:30.960
 like the Bible, you do reap benefits from that.

1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:34.720
 Society reaps benefits from that.

1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:37.960
 And this is not, and sometimes I bring up this point and people are like, oh my God,

1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:38.960
 are you kidding me?

1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:39.960
 Have you read the Old Testament?

1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:43.640
 They're clobbering people with rocks when they do the wrong thing.

1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:48.600
 The Bible doesn't claim to be this, like do everything that was done in the Bible.

1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:53.440
 It's more like charting this moral progression where we came from this very barbaric society

1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:58.640
 into something more like the New Testament where we're honoring individual sovereignty

1:27:58.640 --> 1:28:00.120
 above the state and things like that.

1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:07.520
 So I think that mythology itself is another form of data compression.

1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:13.120
 If you look at these stories, Cain enables a good example, or Peterson makes the point

1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:15.040
 that it's a tiny story.

1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:22.400
 It's a paragraph ish long, but it contains so many layers of meaning in regards to violence,

1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:30.320
 to evil, betrayal, work, the divergence between intention and result, because I think Cain

1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:37.080
 is actually making, he's making the effort to sacrifice for God, but the sacrifices

1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:41.200
 he's making are not, God doesn't find them useful.

1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:47.120
 And so he sort of rejects them.

1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:53.360
 Again, we're organized by these useful fictions, these herarian imagined orders.

1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:58.320
 I think mythology is kind of the original version of that, where we were learning to

1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:09.240
 organize ourselves around stories to best coordinate our action across space and time.

1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:16.200
 And so I think it's very foundational, and back to what we were saying in the beginning,

1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:21.200
 that if value truly is fundamental, I think it's interesting that all these stories point

1:29:21.200 --> 1:29:24.680
 towards often common moral values.

1:29:24.680 --> 1:29:32.040
 They're not perfectly aligned, but it does speak to just the evolutionary importance

1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:37.320
 of morality and the subjectivity of morality, where morality sort of evolves over time based

1:29:37.320 --> 1:29:42.600
 on, frankly, the capital stock we've accumulated, the more capital stock we've accumulated, the

1:29:42.600 --> 1:29:47.600
 easier life is, the less barbaric we have to be, whereas if we're living in conditions

1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:55.400
 of true scarcity, then we tend to be a bit more barbaric towards one another.

1:29:55.400 --> 1:30:01.240
 And that too, to dovetail this into something largely unrelated, but I think is really important,

1:30:01.240 --> 1:30:03.640
 is inflation.

1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:10.160
 Inflation by artificially increasing the prices of goods and services in the world, we're

1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:15.080
 injecting more dollars, chasing the same level of goods and services.

1:30:15.080 --> 1:30:21.760
 We are artificially increasing scarcity, perceived scarcity.

1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:30.040
 When you increase perceived scarcity, you are amplifying divisiveness.

1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:34.600
 The natural state of man is when everything is scarce and you really have to fight hard

1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:37.680
 just to eat or drink water that day.

1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:44.840
 So it's decivilizing, in a way, by artificially amplifying the perceived scarcity in the world.

1:30:44.840 --> 1:30:49.360
 Can you elaborate how does inflation increase the perceived scarcity in the world?

1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:54.640
 So we could think the price itself is an indication, it's a data packet, if you will.

1:30:54.640 --> 1:31:00.400
 The price is a data packet on supply and demand, it's telling you how much supply there is

1:31:00.400 --> 1:31:03.680
 of something in the world relative to the demand.

1:31:03.680 --> 1:31:10.120
 So when you print money and artificially increase that price, it's diverging away from supply

1:31:10.120 --> 1:31:11.120
 and demand.

1:31:11.120 --> 1:31:18.000
 It's becoming just more of a product of policy than it is of free market fundamentals.

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:22.720
 The more expensive something is, that is a signal to the marketplace and to market actors

1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:24.840
 that it is scarce.

1:31:24.840 --> 1:31:30.920
 That's why Leonardo painting might sell for $16 million, there's only one, there's a

1:31:30.920 --> 1:31:33.120
 lot of demand for it.

1:31:33.120 --> 1:31:36.040
 Maybe my numbers are off, but you get the point.

1:31:36.040 --> 1:31:40.720
 It's the reason mask spiked in price after the COVID announcement, there was not enough

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:43.760
 supply, toilet paper, etc.

1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:52.160
 So inflation, and by inflation I specifically mean arbitrary fiat currency supply inflation

1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:57.760
 by legal monopoly, not inflation's a commonly misunderstood word.

1:31:57.760 --> 1:32:04.040
 That is amplifying the perception of scarcity among market actors in the world.

1:32:04.040 --> 1:32:07.840
 And I would argue that it actually amplifies divisiveness.

1:32:07.840 --> 1:32:14.760
 I think this is the key maybe to looking at the connection between the monopolization

1:32:14.760 --> 1:32:22.920
 of money and things like cancel culture because it's increasing our natural predilection to

1:32:22.920 --> 1:32:26.880
 be combative with one another because we think there's more scarcity in the world than there

1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:31.280
 actually is versus in a world where you're not increasing the money supply, prices are

1:32:31.280 --> 1:32:33.320
 declining every year.

1:32:33.320 --> 1:32:39.200
 As prices decline, this is a signal to market actors in the market that scarcity is declining.

1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:42.080
 There's less need to fight over things.

1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:48.800
 And all of this ties back into the old Bastiot saying that if goods don't cross borders,

1:32:48.800 --> 1:32:50.440
 soldiers will.

1:32:50.440 --> 1:32:54.200
 So if we're not trading with one another, if we're not acting interdependently and we're

1:32:54.200 --> 1:33:03.400
 not becoming more intelligent as a market, and that increased intelligence or increased

1:33:03.400 --> 1:33:10.240
 knowledge is reflected in decreased prices because prices are just the exchange ratios

1:33:10.240 --> 1:33:11.240
 of things.

1:33:11.240 --> 1:33:14.760
 So the smarter we can solve problems, the better we can solve problems, the less prices

1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:16.040
 would be.

1:33:16.040 --> 1:33:17.920
 So it induces more cooperation.

1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:24.840
 I love how you tie inflation and cancel culture together as essentially artificial creation

1:33:24.840 --> 1:33:31.920
 of increase of conflict, artificially increasing scarcity and thereby artificially increasing

1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:33.640
 conflict.

1:33:33.640 --> 1:33:35.960
 That's really fascinating.

1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:40.520
 You're short circuiting my brain many times throughout this conversation.

1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:41.520
 Okay.

1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:42.520
 I'm struggling.

1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:45.480
 This robot is struggling to keep up.

1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:46.640
 Okay.

1:33:46.640 --> 1:33:54.000
 Maybe to step back at the useful fictions or pragmatic truths.

1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:59.120
 Let me ask the question that you've answered in many ways already, but let's explicitly

1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:01.440
 look at what is money?

1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:07.760
 Oh, as you know, that's my favorite question.

1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:13.840
 Is the name of the show I just launched, the what is money show?

1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:18.840
 Clearly the, we could say the Bitcoin rabbit hole is what's led me to explore a lot of

1:34:18.840 --> 1:34:25.720
 these ideas in depth, and I think as we've demonstrated today, it goes well beyond just

1:34:25.720 --> 1:34:30.360
 the economic sphere when you start to think about things like exchange and morality and

1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:33.400
 time preference and civilization.

1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:36.080
 So I love the question, what is money?

1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:41.800
 I think it is the key to incepting a deeper understanding of the world into people that

1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:49.560
 if you actually just start to ask the seemingly simple question, it surfaces more and more

1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:51.960
 layers of truth.

1:34:51.960 --> 1:34:59.960
 And I recently, I just wrote a piece, I think I have 30 something answers to this question.

1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:00.960
 So there's

1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:05.280
 So sometimes it's actually a more systematic way of asking the question of what is the

1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:06.280
 meaning of life?

1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:13.560
 You know, there's some questions that are almost unanswerable, but in their asking allow

1:35:13.560 --> 1:35:20.800
 you to deeply understand, get closer to truth, deeply understand the nature of our human

1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:21.800
 existence.

1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:29.800
 And the meaning of life is almost like this initial philosophers striving towards that.

1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:36.160
 If money is indeed as fundamental as you've described, especially in the context of value

1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:41.920
 being fundamental, then that is a really, that's a more, let's take a 21st century way

1:35:41.920 --> 1:35:45.200
 of asking the same question about what is the meaning of life.

1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:51.200
 You mentioned that it's a meta property out of the list of many ways to answer that question.

1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:53.400
 How would you help people to think about that?

1:35:53.400 --> 1:36:01.640
 Yeah, the first most serious answer comes from the School of Austrian Economics, and

1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:06.680
 it defines money as a universal medium of exchange.

1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:15.920
 So this would be any good that is used, held and used purely for purposes of facilitating

1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:17.680
 exchange.

1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:25.320
 So in the configuration of demand for any particular asset, it's bifurcated between

1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:31.240
 its utility, which is something, a service that it can render to you in real time, whether

1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:35.240
 it's, you know, if it's water, you're thirsty.

1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:39.280
 That's the utility of water is that it can cointre thirst.

1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:43.960
 Whereas the marketability would be the expectation of future exchange that other people would

1:36:43.960 --> 1:36:49.440
 want this asset in the future to trade it for whatever they may have.

1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:55.040
 Money is just going to be the good in any trading economy that has the highest proportion

1:36:55.040 --> 1:36:58.000
 of marketability relative to utility.

1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.800
 So today, that would be gold.

1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:06.720
 Gold has utility, it's used in electronics, it's used in dentistry and whatnot, but it's

1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:09.960
 largely used as a store value across time.

1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:12.240
 And that's what it's been used for for 5,000 years.

1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:18.600
 So if we say gold has a $10 trillion market cap, maybe $2 trillion of that is its utility

1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:22.720
 value or it's actually demand for use in computers and dentistry.

1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:28.840
 And an $8 trillion of that is demand for its use as a store value.

1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:35.320
 Money, the marketability aspects of money boils down to five services that money can

1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:36.960
 render.

1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:41.760
 Money needs to be divisible, it needs to be durable, it needs to be recognizable, needs

1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:45.720
 to be portable, and it needs to be scarce.

1:37:45.720 --> 1:37:50.680
 So I'll gloss over a lot of history with this and just say that historically, money's always

1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:53.600
 been a technology, still is a technology or a tool.

1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:57.720
 I use these terms interchangeably and if you think of a technology as just a more sophisticated

1:37:57.720 --> 1:38:05.800
 tool effectively, to best satisfy those properties, monetary metals were determined to be the

1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:11.120
 most satisfactory tool, the most divisible, most durable, most recognizable, most portable

1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:18.040
 tool in the marketplace of the monetary metals, gold was the most scarce, as quantified by

1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:22.360
 either its stock to flow ratio or its inflation resistance.

1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:28.200
 So simple way to say this is that people always prefer the money most resistant to inflation.

1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:33.560
 That's a nice definition of scarcity in the context of money is if you were to measure

1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:36.200
 it, the resistance to inflation.

1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:40.040
 So how hard is it to artificially increase the supply of the thing?

1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:45.000
 That is the hardness of money and that's why gold is hard money because alchemy is hard.

1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:49.960
 That's right because no one cracked alchemy, so gold became money.

1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:57.840
 So that's such a nice clean explanation of what is money with the five elements and gold

1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:01.840
 ultimately won out because of the last piece of scarcity.

1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:02.840
 That's right.

1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:08.320
 And to get to maybe dig a little deeper there, so scarcity, we commonly think of scarcity

1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:15.360
 as strictly a supply property where there's not much of something than it's scarce, but

1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:17.040
 it's not actually true.

1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:20.880
 Scarcity occurs when demand exceeds supply.

1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:25.680
 So when there's more demand than the supply can justify, the thing becomes an economic

1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:30.120
 good and it establishes itself a market price.

1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:33.920
 So there's more demand for the thing than the supply can satisfy.

1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:40.920
 But the unique thing about money as a concept at least is that demand always exceeds supply.

1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:46.600
 There's never enough money to satisfy everyone because another definition for money, it's

1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:48.680
 the most marketable good.

1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:55.240
 So it can be traded for any other good service, piece of knowledge in the marketplace.

1:39:55.240 --> 1:39:58.240
 So humans being what we are, we're never satisfied.

1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:01.320
 We always want more of something, whatever it may be.

1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:09.240
 So money as the ultimate token of obtaining that something is always scarce as a concept.

1:40:09.240 --> 1:40:14.320
 But the problem with money is that if you can, as you alluded to, easily increase its

1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:20.720
 supply, then all of a sudden you can compromise the scarcity of it over time and you can rob

1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:23.320
 people through inflation.

1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:26.680
 So that's why the market settled on gold as money.

1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:34.640
 And robbing is reallocating the value that, so essentially the one property, like why

1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:46.320
 scarcity is important is it adds a lot more friction to the reallocation like through

1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:48.960
 essentially violence or implied violence.

1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:51.480
 Well it prevents it through cost of extraction too.

1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:56.160
 So if you want to go out and dilute gold holders today, you have to go out into the world and

1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:57.160
 mine gold.

1:40:57.160 --> 1:40:59.840
 It's a very expensive process.

1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:05.280
 That process tends to find equilibrium where production cost equals a market value of gold.

1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:09.640
 So if market value is $2,000 an ounce today of gold, its production cost is going to be

1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:11.120
 around there.

1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:12.480
 That's the natural market equilibrium.

1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:17.640
 So that way, gold miners cannot just dilute people over time, whereas if you look at something

1:41:17.640 --> 1:41:23.920
 like fiat currency, which we're jumping ahead a little bit, but its production cost is zero.

1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:28.080
 So there's a reason the market value of fiat currency historically has always converged

1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:31.580
 to zero because its production cost is near zero.

1:41:31.580 --> 1:41:37.840
 So the extension to that question might be how did we get from gold to paper currency?

1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:41.680
 And again, this is rooted in the properties of money.

1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:46.080
 As good as monetary metals were and as good as gold is as money at holding value across

1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:50.800
 time, it's rather limited in terms of portability.

1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:54.160
 It is not as useful for moving value across space.

1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:58.080
 This is another definition of money, by the way, a social device for moving value across

1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:00.480
 space and time.

1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:08.280
 So to rectify this technological shortcoming of gold, we introduced, first of all, the

1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:15.720
 custody of gold was gradually centralized into fewer and fewer warehousing operations.

1:42:15.720 --> 1:42:21.200
 This is because there are economies of scale associated with using gold as money and that

1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:26.640
 if you centralize the custody, the warehouse owner can then issue a paper receipt called

1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:31.280
 the warehouse receipt for that gold and then market participants can trade that paper as

1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:35.680
 if it's good as gold and everyone has an option at any time to go and redeem real gold from

1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:36.960
 the warehouse.

1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:43.240
 So that system works until the problem with it is that it introduces the need to trust

1:42:43.240 --> 1:42:44.240
 the custodian.

1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:47.800
 So it's introducing counterparty risk in the form of the custodian.

1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:54.680
 And now should that warehouse choose to increase the supply of paper notes to gold beyond its

1:42:54.680 --> 1:42:55.680
 supply?

1:42:55.680 --> 1:43:01.400
 So if it's got three tons of gold and it issues six tons worth of paper receipts, all of a

1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:03.560
 sudden it's participating in a fraud.

1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:04.560
 It's basically lying.

1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:09.080
 It's representing that it has more gold than it actually does.

1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:15.320
 And that is the pathway that we got into banking and central banking is we needed a convenience

1:43:15.320 --> 1:43:19.560
 mechanism to rectify the portability shortcomings of gold.

1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:22.400
 We needed to be able to move value across space.

1:43:22.400 --> 1:43:26.280
 Gold is doing a great job at moving value over time, but not space.

1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:30.280
 Paper currency gave us the ability to move value across space, but it introduced this

1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:38.400
 attack vector for warehouse operators, which became central banks to modify the supply

1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:45.120
 to suit their own political agendas added the snooze button allows you to do just do

1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:49.240
 a little fraud to get something for nothing, something just a little bit at first.

1:43:49.240 --> 1:43:50.240
 Yeah.

1:43:50.240 --> 1:43:52.960
 Just just just this one morning, just a little bit.

1:43:52.960 --> 1:44:00.240
 I mean, I don't know if you can speak to the birth of fiat currency.

1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:07.680
 Is there some interesting characteristics to that those early steps that created it?

1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:16.000
 Could it have been averted or is this the natural progression of governments?

1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:22.040
 You know what's funny is that central banking was initially designed to be the custodian

1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:23.600
 of gold, right?

1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:31.400
 So they were going to custody the gold issue paper on top of it and then they would maintain

1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:33.480
 you could trust the public stamp effectively.

1:44:33.480 --> 1:44:37.400
 You could trust that the central bank had as much gold on reserve as they said they had

1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:39.320
 and they were supposed to be the trustworthy institution.

1:44:39.320 --> 1:44:45.880
 So we went from placing our trust in a free market game theoretic process or trusting gold

1:44:45.880 --> 1:44:51.840
 and we began trusting this institution instead.

1:44:51.840 --> 1:44:58.200
 That institution would not have arisen if the portability of gold was really high.

1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:02.440
 If we could have somehow sent gold across a telecommunications channel, there would

1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:05.320
 have been no need for a central bank.

1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:10.880
 One could have custodied their gold in any information bearing medium, frankly, and they

1:45:10.880 --> 1:45:13.840
 could beam it around the world at any time.

1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:21.160
 So this whole institution itself is rooted in a technological shortcoming of gold.

1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:26.880
 So I think it's another way to think about that is maybe had there been all the gold

1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:32.040
 in the world today fills two Olympic sized swimming pools, all the gold mined throughout

1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:33.040
 all of human history.

1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:36.080
 So there's not a lot, right?

1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:40.640
 What if there had been just like way more, there'd just been, I don't know, 20,000 Olympic

1:45:40.640 --> 1:45:43.320
 swimming pools worth.

1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:46.240
 Portability wouldn't have been as much of an issue.

1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:52.520
 And this is to say assuming gold was still the most scarce metal and all these things.

1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:54.640
 Portability would have been less of an issue.

1:45:54.640 --> 1:45:58.080
 We would have had less dependence or need for a central bank.

1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:03.160
 So I think it's kind of idiosyncratic and that we just happened to end up here on this

1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:05.160
 planet with a certain amount of gold.

1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:07.520
 It best satisfied the properties of money.

1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:12.560
 And a certain amount of humans geographically dispersed such that portability had certain

1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:18.000
 properties that you want to achieve for humans in a geographical space to be able to be an

1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:19.000
 exchange value.

1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:21.000
 It became more of an issue as we globalized.

1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:25.280
 As we became more of a global society, we needed money that could move across space

1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:26.280
 really fast.

1:46:26.280 --> 1:46:29.760
 Right, so we could trade in international capital markets.

1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:35.800
 So that drove the central bank to become the dominant institution of the world.

1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:40.440
 And if you follow the flows of gold throughout history, you know, I've been watching this

1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:43.600
 documentary on World War I and World War II on Netflix.

1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:45.520
 I think it's called World War II in color.

1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:46.520
 Oh, yeah.

1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:47.760
 That's really good.

1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:50.720
 It's so good.

1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:55.200
 When I say gold has been the governor of governments or gold is geopolitical money.

1:46:55.200 --> 1:47:00.680
 Like it is the base layer operating system has been the base layer operating system for

1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:02.240
 analog society.

1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:07.840
 So it's always been about who controls the gold is who makes the rules.

1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:15.320
 And that's in that context is why Bitcoin is so interesting because it is the disruptor

1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:21.960
 to this base level operating system that's function for all of human history.

1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:24.480
 I think this is a good place to ask.

1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:28.040
 We asked the what is money question?

1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:32.040
 What is Bitcoin?

1:47:32.040 --> 1:47:35.080
 That's a question as complicated as what is money?

1:47:35.080 --> 1:47:43.760
 I think if you get a general understanding of money from a number of angles that we could

1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:51.640
 say Bitcoin is the most superior monetary technology that has ever existed.

1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:56.720
 So one of the most superior implementation of the ideas of money that you talked about,

1:47:56.720 --> 1:48:01.120
 you talked about money as speech, you talked about money as an idea.

1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:04.640
 We talked about money as sovereignty.

1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:11.720
 So we're attaching the concept of money to your point to whatever tool best satisfies

1:48:11.720 --> 1:48:16.960
 those properties of money or best renders those services we need for money.

1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:21.120
 And as you said, you're using the word tool and technology interchangeably here.

1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:22.120
 Yes.

1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:28.600
 And another thing to think about here is that we think often in terms of goods or services,

1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:31.960
 but actually everything is a service.

1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:36.880
 So it's not the physical properties of this pen that I find valuable.

1:48:36.880 --> 1:48:41.600
 It's the services that it renders to me that I want to write a letter.

1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:47.960
 This serves me by allowing me to lay ink on paper and communicate information.

1:48:47.960 --> 1:48:56.440
 So value, humans attach value, as we alluded to earlier, to services, not goods.

1:48:56.440 --> 1:49:00.640
 So the properties or the services that money renders that human beings value are those

1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:06.400
 five properties, divisibility, durability, recognizability, portability, scarcity.

1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:12.920
 Metals best satisfied those services historically, but Bitcoin as the most superior monetary technology

1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:17.440
 in human history essentially perfects them.

1:49:17.440 --> 1:49:19.280
 It's as close to perfection as we've ever been.

1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:24.960
 So in terms of divisibility, each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100 million subunits

1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:29.320
 called a Satoshi.

1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:34.640
 If that divisibility were ever a problem, which actually there was a question that came up

1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:38.960
 recently, if you divide the world population by the total supply of Bitcoin, you end up

1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:46.280
 at like 0.3 Bitcoin per person, call it 300,000 Satoshis per person.

1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:50.680
 What if that was not enough to facilitate economic activity?

1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:54.640
 And the answer to that is Bitcoin can soft fork into further divisibility.

1:49:54.640 --> 1:50:00.720
 So if Bitcoin ate all the money in the world, and the average Bitcoin or wealth was say

1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:06.560
 300,000 Satoshis each, but that wasn't divisible enough maybe to buy coffee and do all these

1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:08.200
 day to day transactions, what would happen?

1:50:08.200 --> 1:50:09.920
 Well, we would increase its divisibility.

1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:15.160
 So Bitcoin's perfected divisibility, the divisibility of money, lets us transact across

1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:21.760
 scales, we can buy coffee or we can buy a house.

1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:23.200
 Durability is an interesting one.

1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:28.560
 So clearly something like gold is very durable, it's resistant to degradation over time.

1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:33.640
 Bitcoin is just pure information, but it's stored in a distributed format.

1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:40.800
 So information stored in a distributed fashion tends to be virtually infinitely durable.

1:50:40.800 --> 1:50:43.600
 The example I'd like to give here is something like the Bible.

1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:46.160
 The Bible is just distributed information.

1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:49.320
 It's stored everywhere and nowhere, so to speak.

1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:53.200
 And for that reason, it has outlasted empires.

1:50:53.200 --> 1:50:54.360
 And Bitcoin's similar.

1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:57.280
 You can't make changes to it unilaterally.

1:50:57.280 --> 1:51:03.400
 But to make explicit, the ways in which it is not durable is the fact that it relies

1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:08.440
 on computing infrastructure, like it needs computers.

1:51:08.440 --> 1:51:13.560
 So if you were to destroy all the computers in the world, it needs mechanisms.

1:51:13.560 --> 1:51:16.600
 The mechanisms that store and transfer information.

1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:17.840
 That's right.

1:51:17.840 --> 1:51:22.600
 And so you could attack it, you could attack gold in the same kind of way as opposed to

1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:27.400
 the physics, but it's probably easier to destroy all the computers in the world than

1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:30.600
 it is to destroy all the gold in the world.

1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:31.600
 Maybe not.

1:51:31.600 --> 1:51:32.600
 I don't know.

1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:33.600
 Anyway.

1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:34.600
 Yeah.

1:51:34.600 --> 1:51:35.600
 You're right.

1:51:35.600 --> 1:51:40.800
 Maybe I'm not sure which one would be harder to destroy, but the other thing is there's

1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:41.960
 a dynamic incentive.

1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:46.520
 So every time you destroy Bitcoin miners, you're creating incentives for anyone else

1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:50.640
 with access to electricity to mine because you're making the algorithm easier.

1:51:50.640 --> 1:51:51.640
 Yeah.

1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:56.680
 So the destruction is difficult because of the decentralized nature of the whole thing.

1:51:56.680 --> 1:51:57.680
 And the difficulty adjustment.

1:51:57.680 --> 1:51:58.680
 Yeah.

1:51:58.680 --> 1:52:02.160
 So you're going to have to use nuclear weapons and cover the whole globe.

1:52:02.160 --> 1:52:03.160
 But anyway.

1:52:03.160 --> 1:52:04.160
 Yeah.

1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:06.560
 And by then, we've got much bigger problems than money, right?

1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:08.120
 That's right.

1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:09.120
 So okay.

1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:10.120
 So that's durability.

1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:12.360
 Bitcoin's pure information.

1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:16.400
 It can move at the speed of light, can't get much faster than that.

1:52:16.400 --> 1:52:23.480
 Recognizability refers to the ability to verify the veracity of the money or its authenticity.

1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:28.700
 So you can actually, when we used to transact gold, there were time honored techniques for

1:52:28.700 --> 1:52:32.480
 verifying that it was gold and not gold plated lead.

1:52:32.480 --> 1:52:34.800
 For instance, this is where we get the term sound money.

1:52:34.800 --> 1:52:38.680
 A gold coin made a very particular sound when dropped from a certain height.

1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:40.320
 You've seen people biting coins.

1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:44.240
 These are all techniques for testing the authenticity of gold.

1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:48.440
 And with Bitcoin, we have something unique in that if you're running a full node, you

1:52:48.440 --> 1:52:51.200
 can verify that the Bitcoin is Bitcoin, right?

1:52:51.200 --> 1:52:55.200
 It cannot be tampered with, it cannot be faked.

1:52:55.200 --> 1:52:59.080
 And in addition to that, as a node operator, you can audit the total supply of Bitcoin

1:52:59.080 --> 1:53:01.680
 at any time, which is unlike any money in history.

1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:08.080
 So you know, with full certainty, if you're holding 1000 Bitcoin, you have 1000 out of

1:53:08.080 --> 1:53:10.440
 a possible 21 million forever.

1:53:10.440 --> 1:53:12.680
 You have a guaranteed fraction of the total supply.

1:53:12.680 --> 1:53:13.680
 Yeah.

1:53:13.680 --> 1:53:16.640
 So a full node contains information about every transaction that's ever been had.

1:53:16.640 --> 1:53:23.680
 So you can figure out, yeah, I mean, all the truth of this money is all right there.

1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:24.680
 Yeah.

1:53:24.680 --> 1:53:27.120
 It's like a fractal constituent of the whole network, right?

1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:31.200
 The whole Bitcoin blockchain is comprised in a node too.

1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:35.960
 Not the proof of work piece, but the entire transaction history.

1:53:35.960 --> 1:53:37.080
 And so that's unique as well.

1:53:37.080 --> 1:53:42.320
 And that's what makes Bitcoin the ultimate store value, is that you know with certainty

1:53:42.320 --> 1:53:45.200
 what the total supply is and will ever be.

1:53:45.200 --> 1:53:49.520
 And you know that your share of that supply is fixed.

1:53:49.520 --> 1:53:50.520
 It cannot change.

1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:51.800
 It can only improve actually.

1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:56.920
 If someone loses, you know, if the Satoshi stash is truly gone forever, the million Bitcoin

1:53:56.920 --> 1:54:01.880
 never moves, then we're talking about 1000 Bitcoin out of 20 million instead and so on

1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:02.880
 and so forth.

1:54:02.880 --> 1:54:07.400
 I mean, as more people lose access to their Bitcoin, they're basically making a contribution

1:54:07.400 --> 1:54:08.400
 to everyone else.

1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:09.400
 It's anti dilutive.

1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:14.600
 And there are certain properties of Bitcoin that are sort of a little bit more into the

1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:21.440
 details that ensure that the full nodes, like the size of all the transactions that ever

1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:25.800
 happened, at least currently can be stored in a single computer, for example.

1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:28.200
 So it doesn't blow up too quickly.

1:54:28.200 --> 1:54:29.200
 That's right.

1:54:29.200 --> 1:54:33.200
 You know, there's arguments that that's not necessary, you can make arguments for that

1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:38.400
 to be a very nice property, but you can also say that there's like drawbacks to it.

1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:42.640
 That's hence the block size debates and all those kinds of things.

1:54:42.640 --> 1:54:43.640
 Yeah.

1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:45.360
 That was the Bitcoin cash civil war, right?

1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:48.400
 It was that particular piece.

1:54:48.400 --> 1:54:53.640
 And you know, ostensibly, they were saying, oh, we need more transaction throughput to

1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:55.520
 buy more coffee and do more transactions.

1:54:55.520 --> 1:55:02.400
 But what they were actually doing was increasing the size of computing power necessary to run

1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:06.880
 a full node, which would have theoretically compromised decentralization.

1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:13.760
 So yeah, but it would, in theory, you know, in theory, it would allow you to have much

1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:15.200
 more transactions.

1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:16.440
 That's right.

1:55:16.440 --> 1:55:21.960
 But the drawback, it would, because of no longer it can be stored in a single computer,

1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:26.680
 in a single computer, then it naturally leads to decentralization, the same kind of thing

1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:31.880
 we see with gold, which would have compromised its survivability, right?

1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:37.040
 So what else is the last one, which leads straight into this one actually is the most

1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:45.200
 important one of money, which is scarcity, and that you need to know the supply is fixed

1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:51.920
 and safeguarded from counterfeiting and inflation, which counterfeiting and inflation are the

1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:54.160
 same thing, by the way.

1:55:54.160 --> 1:56:00.200
 Counterfeiting is criminalized inflation, inflation is legalized counterfeiting.

1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:03.760
 So central banks today, when they say they're printing money, they're not their counterfeiting

1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:05.560
 currency.

1:56:05.560 --> 1:56:07.320
 That's a very important part.

1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:13.600
 And Bitcoin, as I've argued in some of my writing, is more than just an invention.

1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:19.960
 It's actually the discovery of absolute scarcity and that we have unveiled a property of money

1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:23.880
 that we will only discover once.

1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:28.800
 And it's got really major ramifications for the world at large.

1:56:28.800 --> 1:56:36.320
 So with gold, for instance, as we've covered, it became money because it was the most relatively

1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:38.040
 scarce monetary metal, right?

1:56:38.040 --> 1:56:41.360
 Its supply was hardest to increase over time.

1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:45.680
 However, if we could somehow flip a switch today and make everyone in the world go out

1:56:45.680 --> 1:56:49.120
 and start mining gold, we could increase the supply much more quickly.

1:56:49.120 --> 1:56:52.000
 We could, you know, it's historic inflation rates about 2%.

1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.960
 We could double that pretty quickly.

1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:58.640
 Bitcoin, with Bitcoin, it is not possible.

1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:03.880
 So no matter how much effort and energy and capital and operational expenditure we pour

1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:09.920
 into the mining network, we cannot deviate from its fixed and diminishing supply curve

1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:14.960
 from between now and the last Bitcoin being mined in 2140 because of the difficulty adjustment.

1:57:14.960 --> 1:57:18.440
 It's constantly, it's adapting to human action, actually.

1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:22.000
 So the harder we pursue it, the more that it recedes.

1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:26.120
 And then the less we pursue it, the more available it makes itself.

1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:33.760
 And this is, it's a real major breakthrough because it's the closest thing to perfect

1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:37.400
 information we've ever had in an economy.

1:57:37.400 --> 1:57:45.680
 And perfect information is this, it's a theoretical but unattainable state of the market where

1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:51.240
 all market actors have all the relevant information about everything so that they can compete

1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:53.160
 as efficiently as possible.

1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:57.880
 And in the state of pure information, we have, I'm sorry, perfect information, we have perfect

1:57:57.880 --> 1:57:58.880
 competition.

1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:03.160
 And in perfect competition, we maximize wealth generation.

1:58:03.160 --> 1:58:10.160
 So we're competing as freely as possible from coercive and violent impediments.

1:58:10.160 --> 1:58:18.680
 And so I think Bitcoin in that sense is going to pull the world closer to a state of perfect

1:58:18.680 --> 1:58:24.960
 competition than we've ever been before, which would increase wealth generation to an extent

1:58:24.960 --> 1:58:27.720
 we've never seen before.

1:58:27.720 --> 1:58:32.680
 Many of the things you said about Bitcoin also hold for other cryptocurrency technologies

1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:36.160
 that followed after.

1:58:36.160 --> 1:58:44.640
 Can you say something to why you think Bitcoin is the superior technology from a pragmatic

1:58:44.640 --> 1:58:52.760
 truth perspective than say Ethereum, but also other cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin Cash,

1:58:52.760 --> 1:59:00.240
 like other hard forks of Bitcoin, and maybe things that might yet to be invent tools yet

1:59:00.240 --> 1:59:02.040
 to be invented.

1:59:02.040 --> 1:59:08.000
 So this is a good point of argument because a lot of people have countered me and said,

1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:13.040
 Bitcoin cannot be absolute, absolute scarcity because you can fork it and create something

1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:17.680
 with the same properties as Bitcoin or potentially even better properties, right?

1:59:17.680 --> 1:59:21.720
 You create something with a deflationary monetary policy.

1:59:21.720 --> 1:59:26.040
 That's what Bitcoin Cash was actually, it forked Bitcoin with all of the same properties

1:59:26.040 --> 1:59:29.280
 except for the block size that we alluded to earlier.

1:59:29.280 --> 1:59:36.560
 The problem is that money is valued, again, it's the good with a configuration of demand

1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:40.560
 that is predominantly marketability.

1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:43.680
 So it is valued based on its liquidity.

1:59:43.680 --> 1:59:48.920
 That is, how many other trading partners are there in that monetary network?

1:59:48.920 --> 1:59:54.920
 So it is a network valued because of its liquidity and network effects.

1:59:54.920 --> 2:00:02.720
 So any new entrant into the market for money is incentivized to always choose the money

2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:06.680
 with the deepest liquidity and the most network effects.

2:00:06.680 --> 2:00:11.600
 This is why money has tended to be a winner take all market because it's essentially a

2:00:11.600 --> 2:00:13.560
 single purpose tool, right?

2:00:13.560 --> 2:00:19.680
 It is a tool for, if we consider that tools are time saving devices, right?

2:00:19.680 --> 2:00:23.360
 The shovel that you dig more holes per man hour than you can with your bare hands, money

2:00:23.360 --> 2:00:28.520
 is a tool, there's yet another definition of money that lets us calculate, negotiate

2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:31.680
 and execute trades more quickly.

2:00:31.680 --> 2:00:38.720
 So that function tends to coalesce towards one solution.

2:00:38.720 --> 2:00:44.680
 And so the short answer would be that for the same reasons, quantifiable reasons, right,

2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:50.720
 like inflation resistance and liquidity and network effects, that we have one analog gold,

2:00:50.720 --> 2:00:53.680
 we're only likely to have one digital gold.

2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:57.360
 And I think the Bitcoin cash fork proves that out empirically.

2:00:57.360 --> 2:00:59.080
 It's a good case study because...

2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:01.000
 Well, it's for a case study, right?

2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.040
 But okay, so that's really well put.

2:01:03.040 --> 2:01:06.120
 So like gold was sticky.

2:01:06.120 --> 2:01:11.160
 Once it was accepted, the network effects, the winner take all took over.

2:01:11.160 --> 2:01:20.040
 And here's a fundamentally different kind of like analog versus digital is a leap technologies.

2:01:20.040 --> 2:01:28.280
 And you're suggesting that there may not be, there's unlikely to be other leaps of that

2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:32.240
 kind into a whole nother kind of space of technologies.

2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:38.240
 I would argue that Bitcoin, it's kind of like the ideological synthesis of gold, taking

2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:42.000
 the monetary properties of gold and combining them with the internet itself.

2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:47.200
 And in doing so, it has essentially perfected the properties of money, right?

2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:51.880
 You can't get more divisible, durable, recognizable, portable or scarce than Bitcoin.

2:01:51.880 --> 2:01:59.120
 So Satoshi has kind of, he left no design space for superior technology to intercede

2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:03.120
 and outcompete Bitcoin at this point now that it's established liquidity in the network

2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:04.120
 effects.

2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:05.120
 Far superior technology, right?

2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:09.920
 Yeah, but it's a combination of the tech itself and the social layer that is coalesced

2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:10.920
 to it.

2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:11.920
 You can't separate those two out.

2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:12.920
 That's right.

2:02:12.920 --> 2:02:14.800
 They're all connected and then the political as well.

2:02:14.800 --> 2:02:20.160
 I mean, but the portability, for example, that's another way to phrase that is the, what

2:02:20.160 --> 2:02:21.160
 is it?

2:02:21.160 --> 2:02:22.160
 The scaling.

2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:29.760
 So the number of transactions, that's a limitation for Bitcoin that many argues a feature, many

2:02:29.760 --> 2:02:30.920
 argues a bug.

2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:38.960
 You have a bunch of cryptocurrency technologies that are able to achieve much faster frequency

2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:45.000
 of transactions, much more transactions, all that kind of stuff.

2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:48.200
 What are your thoughts on that?

2:02:48.200 --> 2:02:51.920
 The low level of transactions is possible with Bitcoin.

2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:52.920
 Do you think that's a feature?

2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:55.160
 Do you think that's a bug?

2:02:55.160 --> 2:02:56.960
 Necessary for security, actually.

2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:01.960
 And even these other crypto assets that settle more quickly, they settle with less assurance

2:03:01.960 --> 2:03:03.760
 of finality.

2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:09.280
 So Nick Carter has a great piece on this actually called, the settlement assurance is stupid.

2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:10.280
 It's really good.

2:03:10.280 --> 2:03:16.920
 Where the gist of it is that there is more work being done in each block of Bitcoin that

2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:20.800
 it can't, it is less vulnerable to reversion.

2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:25.920
 So it's giving you higher degrees of assurance that your settlement or your trade has occurred

2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:31.400
 with finality, whereas other blockchains are much more vulnerable.

2:03:31.400 --> 2:03:38.800
 And again, with Bitcoin, the evolutionary path of money with gold is that it was first

2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:40.640
 used as a collectible.

2:03:40.640 --> 2:03:43.360
 It then became used as a store value.

2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:48.840
 After it had stored enough value, it began to be used as a medium of exchange.

2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:51.600
 And then finally, when it was used widely enough as a medium of exchange, it becomes

2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:52.600
 a unit of account.

2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:55.280
 We actually start to think in the money.

2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:57.840
 Bitcoin's following a similar path.

2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:00.520
 So it started out as kind of a collectible.

2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:04.280
 Today I would argue it's a store value, one of the most effective store value we've ever

2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:05.760
 seen.

2:04:05.760 --> 2:04:10.480
 So that evolutionary path that Bitcoin's following is similar to gold.

2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:11.480
 First a collectible.

2:04:11.480 --> 2:04:12.480
 Today is store value.

2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:18.640
 To be an effective store value, it has to optimize for supply cap.

2:04:18.640 --> 2:04:23.040
 That has to be the first, and this is all Bitcoin really needs to do to be successful,

2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:24.040
 by the way.

2:04:24.040 --> 2:04:28.400
 Exactly what it's been doing for 12 years virtually flawlessly, which is keep creating

2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:34.080
 a block every 10 minutes, and keep enforcing a supply cap of 21 million.

2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:43.360
 As long as those two things hold, it is sound money, the ultimate sound money, the most

2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:44.760
 inflation resistant money there's ever been.

2:04:44.760 --> 2:04:47.960
 It's actually completely immune.

2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:50.440
 It's taken unexpected inflation to 0%.

2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:55.200
 We know with perfect certainty what Bitcoin supply will ever be.

2:04:55.200 --> 2:05:01.040
 For it to be used more broadly as a medium of exchange, it can't make trade offs at the

2:05:01.040 --> 2:05:07.120
 base layer to increase its portability, for instance, even though portability is maybe

2:05:07.120 --> 2:05:11.520
 kind of a misnomer because Bitcoin has extremely high portability, just doesn't have extremely

2:05:11.520 --> 2:05:13.600
 high transaction throughput.

2:05:13.600 --> 2:05:18.040
 So we could say you can move it pretty quickly anywhere in the world as long as you're willing

2:05:18.040 --> 2:05:25.000
 to bid up for the block space, but you can't satisfy all the world's economic volume.

2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:28.720
 You can't do 300 million transactions per second like you can on a centralized database

2:05:28.720 --> 2:05:30.800
 like Visa.

2:05:30.800 --> 2:05:37.160
 But Bitcoin needs to be this, it has to be a store value first before it can be a medium

2:05:37.160 --> 2:05:38.880
 of exchange.

2:05:38.880 --> 2:05:44.440
 So it has to protect the supply cap first before making any trade offs for that.

2:05:44.440 --> 2:05:50.000
 And I would argue that that's why Bitcoin is so rigid is that it's optimized for survivability

2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:56.000
 and optimized for that supply cap, and it's pushing experimentation and other features

2:05:56.000 --> 2:05:59.540
 that would increase its transaction throughput to higher layers.

2:05:59.540 --> 2:06:03.560
 So I think Lightning Network is something that's very interesting.

2:06:03.560 --> 2:06:10.960
 It's still early, but there's a lot of throughput already being used on the Lightning Network.

2:06:10.960 --> 2:06:16.120
 And it makes some slight trade offs in terms of the trust minimization of Bitcoin, you

2:06:16.120 --> 2:06:19.600
 end up trusting these smart contracts instead of move the Bitcoin.

2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:23.040
 Which you pick up nearly unlimited transaction throughput.

2:06:23.040 --> 2:06:27.080
 So that's how, and that's how biology evolves, that's how the internet evolved, it evolves

2:06:27.080 --> 2:06:28.080
 in layers.

2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:33.880
 So I think Bitcoin, you can sort of conceive of it as the latest layer to the internet.

2:06:33.880 --> 2:06:38.080
 And it's one that preserves this store value property better than any asset we've ever

2:06:38.080 --> 2:06:39.080
 had.

2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:45.160
 Let me ask sort of a critical question of if you're wrong about your statements of about

2:06:45.160 --> 2:06:54.160
 Bitcoin, you find out years from now that you were wrong, what would that look like?

2:06:54.160 --> 2:06:57.920
 What would be the things that make you realize you were wrong?

2:06:57.920 --> 2:07:01.400
 Likely ideas or crazy out there ideas?

2:07:01.400 --> 2:07:04.720
 Do you think about this kind of stuff all the time?

2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:10.840
 Because you speak very confidently about Bitcoin and one of the things, let me put it this

2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:11.840
 way.

2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:18.560
 I think certainty, I feel like that's like a stoic statement, certainty leads to ruin,

2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:20.060
 something like that.

2:07:20.060 --> 2:07:27.080
 Like certainty I think is an antithesis to progress often.

2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:31.880
 And especially in your writing, but this is true for the Bitcoin community, there's

2:07:31.880 --> 2:07:35.240
 a certainty about the Bitcoin.

2:07:35.240 --> 2:07:39.160
 And that makes me very skeptical, no matter how good the ideas are.

2:07:39.160 --> 2:07:42.240
 Whatever things are good, this might be the Russian and me.

2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:46.360
 I think like, what are the ways this is going to go wrong?

2:07:46.360 --> 2:07:51.320
 So what do you think are the ways this might go wrong or you're wrong in your conception

2:07:51.320 --> 2:07:53.040
 of what Bitcoin is?

2:07:53.040 --> 2:08:05.080
 Yeah, so science evolves via negativa, meaning that we're not proving hypotheses and that's

2:08:05.080 --> 2:08:08.280
 what becomes the body of science.

2:08:08.280 --> 2:08:12.800
 This is whatever is left over as we disprove hypotheses.

2:08:12.800 --> 2:08:22.200
 Whatever we can empirically, through experimentation, disprove gets discarded and whatever remains,

2:08:22.200 --> 2:08:28.680
 whatever theory remains, it hasn't been disproven is science effectively.

2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:35.720
 This process is similar to market actors zeroing in on a store value.

2:08:35.720 --> 2:08:41.480
 They're experimenting with different forms of storing wealth across time.

2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:45.720
 Some do better than others and eventually everyone ends up on the one that is best.

2:08:45.720 --> 2:08:48.000
 That's what gold was.

2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:54.280
 In terms of understanding Bitcoin, I look at it as a similar approach and that is the

2:08:54.280 --> 2:08:57.720
 main question I'm asking myself is, how do you stop this thing?

2:08:57.720 --> 2:08:59.320
 How do you turn it off?

2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:03.560
 How do you end it if you're a nation state, particularly, who has the most to lose in

2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:05.440
 this transition?

2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:08.880
 What is the attack vector by which they neutralize Bitcoin?

2:09:08.880 --> 2:09:14.640
 That is the $250 trillion question.

2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:17.280
 I've spent five years thinking about this thing very deeply.

2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:19.400
 I've read everything on monetary history.

2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:23.800
 I can get my hands on.

2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:30.240
 The general thought of how it is stopped, and this is the snag point that a lot of people

2:09:30.240 --> 2:09:33.840
 get to in their explorations down the rabbit hole, is they just say the government will

2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:35.400
 never allow it.

2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:36.400
 That becomes their bottom.

2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:39.560
 It's like, all right, Bitcoin's interesting, it's superior money, blah, blah, blah, but

2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:41.160
 the government will never allow it.

2:09:41.160 --> 2:09:43.360
 Was Ray Dalio, did he say that?

2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:46.040
 Dalio is currently stuck there.

2:09:46.040 --> 2:09:53.120
 Ray Dalio said that Bitcoin seems to be too promising.

2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:59.880
 If it is in fact as promising as it looks, governments are going to, I don't forget what

2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:02.440
 the exact quote is, but not allow it.

2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:06.280
 The government will ban it.

2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:10.680
 How do you get Ray Dalio unstuck from your perspective?

2:10:10.680 --> 2:10:14.920
 How do you get unstuck from that idea, the governments?

2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:23.520
 How do you prevent governments from stopping a thing that threatens centralized power?

2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:27.320
 Bitcoin is an idea.

2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:35.240
 Governments that are really good at fighting centralized threats to their power, whether

2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:40.520
 that's a currency counterfeiter or a competing nation state or business they don't like,

2:10:40.520 --> 2:10:45.040
 or an individual they don't like, they can kill them, they can throw them in jail, they

2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:49.480
 can use any number of course of our violent tactics to suppress it.

2:10:49.480 --> 2:10:52.760
 How do you point a gun at an idea?

2:10:52.760 --> 2:10:58.800
 How do you coerce an idea?

2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:07.120
 And that's, there is some anecdotal history here where there's the PGP case, which in

2:11:07.120 --> 2:11:12.400
 the United States, the court was trying to classify it as munitions.

2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:18.720
 When we were shipping this pretty good privacy software overseas, government wanted to classify

2:11:18.720 --> 2:11:22.600
 it as munitions and restrict that exportation.

2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:29.200
 But and this was a circuit court case precedent when the PGP attorneys actually printed out

2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:34.120
 the source code on paper and presented it as evidence in the court, all of a sudden it

2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:40.160
 became protected under freedom of speech and that it's just code is speech, code is language

2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:47.880
 and therefore at least in the United States, it's protected under the First Amendment.

2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:54.760
 I think a government ban would be largely unenforceable, frankly, on Bitcoin, being

2:11:54.760 --> 2:11:57.000
 that it's pure information.

2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:02.720
 If you suppress market actors from using it in one jurisdiction, you're just creating

2:12:02.720 --> 2:12:08.480
 incentives for them to go elsewhere and you're actually increasing incentives for other jurisdictions

2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:14.040
 to be favorable towards it because then they can create, they get to benefit from the tax

2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:18.120
 revenue and the businesses and the innovation that's occurring in and around Bitcoin as

2:12:18.120 --> 2:12:19.120
 a result.

2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:27.040
 So you don't think if a particular central bank like in Europe or United States bans it

2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:31.720
 not maybe using those terms, but in some kind of way, you think there's a that provides

2:12:31.720 --> 2:12:36.440
 a really strong incentive for the other big players to enable it?

2:12:36.440 --> 2:12:38.640
 That's right.

2:12:38.640 --> 2:12:42.560
 And they're more likely, by the way, since governments know this, by the way, to the

2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:48.360
 other thing that causes a government to shoot itself in the foot is that if they ban something,

2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:50.800
 they draw a lot of attention to it.

2:12:50.800 --> 2:12:51.800
 People are smart.

2:12:51.800 --> 2:12:53.040
 I mean, people ask why?

2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:54.040
 Why would a government ban it?

2:12:54.040 --> 2:12:55.320
 Why can't I use this?

2:12:55.320 --> 2:12:59.840
 So that's kind of typically be the last arrow in their quiver.

2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:05.640
 They may try to ban it if Bitcoin really starts to monetize very quickly and the power structures

2:13:05.640 --> 2:13:12.400
 that they impose today start to dissolve faster than others might think they will, then they

2:13:12.400 --> 2:13:13.560
 might try and ban it.

2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:17.840
 But I think that ban will be largely unenforceable.

2:13:17.840 --> 2:13:21.600
 They're more likely to tax it, which they already do tax it.

2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:25.560
 They're likely to increase taxation of it.

2:13:25.560 --> 2:13:31.160
 They're likely to try and make it more white market by actually tracing Bitcoin, seeing

2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:37.160
 who has it, attaching identities to Bitcoin ownership and making sure that they're getting

2:13:37.160 --> 2:13:41.800
 their pound of flesh on all the transactions it results in.

2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:53.040
 But I don't think, the other thing about this is, so we saw the internet outcompete intranets

2:13:53.040 --> 2:13:56.840
 in that we could say that open source networks tend to outcompete closed source networks.

2:13:56.840 --> 2:13:58.840
 And there's a really good reason for this.

2:13:58.840 --> 2:14:05.800
 And it's because in a closed source network, there are costs associated with defending

2:14:05.800 --> 2:14:08.240
 the network itself.

2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:14.200
 So you have to, the network owners, the owners of the closed source network have to expend

2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:19.160
 resources protecting it from competitors, and they have to expend resources imposing

2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:24.040
 its rules because people, they're not voluntarily adopted rules, so you actually have to impose

2:14:24.040 --> 2:14:25.040
 these rule sets.

2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:31.040
 Whereas an open source network, which is something much more akin to capitalism in its pure sense,

2:14:31.040 --> 2:14:33.080
 these are voluntarily adopted rules.

2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:37.040
 So all market participants have agreed and consented to this rule set, so there's no

2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:41.200
 enforcement costs and there's no turf protection because anyone can freely enter or exit the

2:14:41.200 --> 2:14:43.080
 open network.

2:14:43.080 --> 2:14:50.760
 For that energetic reason, I think open networks outcompete closed networks typically.

2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:55.240
 And in the digital age, that's why I think, that's why internet outcompetes intranet and

2:14:55.240 --> 2:14:58.880
 that's why open source networks are going to eat closed source networks.

2:14:58.880 --> 2:15:04.800
 So what Bitcoin would be in that lens is the ultimate open source monetary network devouring

2:15:04.800 --> 2:15:08.600
 closed source central bank monetary networks.

2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:16.960
 And I just don't see how there's no possibility of unilaterally stopping Bitcoin or destroying

2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:17.960
 it.

2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:23.440
 So then they're more likely to regulate or tax it.

2:15:23.440 --> 2:15:26.680
 And again, the other fallacy here is that a lot of people tend to think of governments

2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:33.720
 as these singular indivisible entities that just move under one plan, but in reality it's

2:15:33.720 --> 2:15:34.920
 a lot of people, right?

2:15:34.920 --> 2:15:40.480
 And a lot of people with loosely coupled interests and agendas and whatnot.

2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:47.360
 Regulators and others with wearing their citizen hat, they're going to see this thing monetizing.

2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:52.200
 They're going to be on the front lines of trying to regulate it, trying to control it.

2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:56.320
 And I think what's likely to happen is they're going to start to adopt it, to buy some of

2:15:56.320 --> 2:16:02.400
 it even as an individual or possibly even ultimately at a central bank or sovereign

2:16:02.400 --> 2:16:07.520
 wealth fund level as an insurance policy against its success.

2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:12.880
 And once you start to acquire something and then you have a vested economic interest in

2:16:12.880 --> 2:16:18.080
 its monetization, I think it kind of dissolves any of the power structures that are arrayed

2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:20.640
 against it from the inside.

2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:25.000
 So I've written a lot about this in a new series called Sovereignism, which is based

2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:29.120
 loosely on a book called The Sovereign Individual.

2:16:29.120 --> 2:16:34.920
 And that's the general thesis is that microprocessing technology would devour our organizational

2:16:34.920 --> 2:16:38.400
 models, the most important of which is the nation state.

2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:45.920
 So I think we're going into this world where coercion and violence is just much less rewarding.

2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:54.520
 You can't, the economics of violence are declining because of the low cost of protecting property.

2:16:54.520 --> 2:17:02.000
 You can now protect your monetary property in Bitcoin at orders of magnitude less cost

2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:04.400
 than is necessary to run a banking network.

2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:09.840
 So it changes the way we organize ourselves.

2:17:09.840 --> 2:17:15.080
 And again, if we, zooming back to gold as kind of the original governor to governments,

2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:18.480
 where if they manipulated the money, gold would leave their country.

2:17:18.480 --> 2:17:25.720
 That's why governments have taken relatively concerted action to go off of the gold standard.

2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:31.720
 There's a great book on this called The Gold Wars that outlines how governments have been

2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:36.160
 waging a cold war against gold for the past 50 years.

2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:41.680
 Bitcoin sort of renews hope for that free market governor of governments.

2:17:41.680 --> 2:17:45.640
 And that is this digital gold that governments cannot stop or coopt.

2:17:45.640 --> 2:17:54.560
 So I think it's something, that's why I think it's such a big deal is that it is changing,

2:17:54.560 --> 2:17:59.080
 it's a new useful fiction, you might say, a useful fiction that's superordinate to the

2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:04.000
 mythology of the nation state and government as the dominant institution in the world.

2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:12.800
 Well, I hope you're right that all forms of centralized power start breaking apart naturally.

2:18:12.800 --> 2:18:17.640
 Digital governments, the more and more power is given to the individual, whatever the technology

2:18:17.640 --> 2:18:23.160
 is, and Bitcoin seems to be a promising technology that empowers, that enables that, that seems

2:18:23.160 --> 2:18:24.160
 to be the trend.

2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:30.080
 And that's a promising trend from a, at least from a perspective of somebody who values

2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:34.760
 this particular biological meat bag that's full of consciousness.

2:18:34.760 --> 2:18:40.840
 I think Bitcoin is exposing the greatest scam in human history, which is political authority.

2:18:40.840 --> 2:18:46.320
 Like who gives anyone the right to be politically, have political authority over anyone else.

2:18:46.320 --> 2:18:52.480
 People should be free to adopt the rules and systems and tools that best suit their needs.

2:18:52.480 --> 2:19:00.160
 And that arc of history we covered earlier, where as socioeconomic systems have become

2:19:00.160 --> 2:19:06.120
 more favorable towards individual sovereignty, the more wealthy we have become.

2:19:06.120 --> 2:19:10.520
 The more we have given the individual, we've maximized individual choice.

2:19:10.520 --> 2:19:14.800
 The more wealth that society has created, and the more it has outcompeted the systems

2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:15.800
 that have come before it.

2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:21.320
 The latest would be capitalism triumphing over socialism.

2:19:21.320 --> 2:19:25.960
 Before maybe we eat UR in Texas, you brought over some brisket.

2:19:25.960 --> 2:19:30.360
 Before we may be indulged in that, let me bring up one quick topic and then we'll take

2:19:30.360 --> 2:19:31.760
 a break.

2:19:31.760 --> 2:19:40.840
 And the topic of what some may term the toxicity of the Bitcoin community, that you've written

2:19:40.840 --> 2:19:44.520
 that Bitcoin toxicity is tough love.

2:19:44.520 --> 2:19:52.040
 Do you want to break that apart a little bit, sort of the idea, the philosophy of the toxicity

2:19:52.040 --> 2:19:58.120
 that seems to be present in part in the Bitcoin community?

2:19:58.120 --> 2:20:04.240
 Yeah, we were talking about this a little bit before we recorded, and I've been through

2:20:04.240 --> 2:20:07.560
 the gauntlet with Bitcoin toxicity as well.

2:20:07.560 --> 2:20:15.240
 I came into this space professionally in 2017, was originally running a multi strategy crypto

2:20:15.240 --> 2:20:17.600
 asset hedge fund.

2:20:17.600 --> 2:20:23.400
 And my initial investment thesis on the world was that Bitcoin was a big deal, but there

2:20:23.400 --> 2:20:29.240
 were all these other exciting coins and projects and ways the technology was going to be used.

2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:37.360
 And that view of reality met this immune, I guess you could say as an ideological immune

2:20:37.360 --> 2:20:43.480
 system, this Bitcoin toxicity, in that it's kind of a filter that's trying to catch bad

2:20:43.480 --> 2:20:52.960
 or useless or even scamming ideas that this space is very well known for.

2:20:52.960 --> 2:20:58.040
 As we've touched on today, Bitcoin, in my opinion, is this world's shattering innovation,

2:20:58.040 --> 2:21:03.040
 but it's in a sea of the most scammy stuff ever.

2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:05.640
 Anybody can go and create a coin.

2:21:05.640 --> 2:21:11.600
 So you can go and launch one immediately online, and you can throw up a website, an

2:21:11.600 --> 2:21:16.600
 advisor page, post a white paper talking about how great your technology is going to be and

2:21:16.600 --> 2:21:20.760
 how it's going to change the world, and you can raise $30 million in Bitcoin or Ethereum

2:21:20.760 --> 2:21:22.760
 in 30 seconds kind of thing.

2:21:22.760 --> 2:21:27.600
 So it's drawn in a lot of this scam artistry, you might say.

2:21:27.600 --> 2:21:33.560
 And I think people living through that, because there is this natural predilection for people,

2:21:33.560 --> 2:21:36.960
 when they first come into Bitcoin, you're excited about it, then you get lost in the

2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:39.600
 shit coin universe.

2:21:39.600 --> 2:21:45.360
 And then just looking at the market success of Bitcoin versus, and when I use the word

2:21:45.360 --> 2:21:47.360
 shit coin, I'm just...

2:21:47.360 --> 2:21:49.200
 You say with all the love in the world.

2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:53.320
 All the love in the world, I guess you could call me a toxic maximalist in some ways, although

2:21:53.320 --> 2:21:56.160
 I consider myself a freedom maximalist, not a Bitcoin maximalist.

2:21:56.160 --> 2:21:57.720
 Yeah, I saw that line.

2:21:57.720 --> 2:22:00.200
 That's a good line.

2:22:00.200 --> 2:22:06.720
 Bitcoin, tracking the market success of Bitcoin versus alternative crypto assets, the signal

2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:09.560
 is very clear that Bitcoin has outcompeted all of them.

2:22:09.560 --> 2:22:14.720
 So I think that Bitcoin cultural toxicity has evolved as an immune response to those

2:22:14.720 --> 2:22:19.160
 bad ideas, which is actually, if you think about it, kind of is a tough love.

2:22:19.160 --> 2:22:25.640
 You don't want new entrance to the space to get lost in shit coin jungle and learn the

2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:31.600
 hard way the way many Bitcoin maximalists have that the real innovation is Bitcoin.

2:22:31.600 --> 2:22:36.640
 But like an immune system, I think it can also go too far.

2:22:36.640 --> 2:22:43.560
 And so I think it's useful when it is defending the space from false narratives, we might say,

2:22:43.560 --> 2:22:50.080
 but it becomes detrimental when it's attacking people that are inquiring about Bitcoin or

2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:56.200
 people that are approaching Bitcoin with a good spirit and good intention and a desire

2:22:56.200 --> 2:22:57.200
 to learn.

2:22:57.200 --> 2:23:02.840
 Because then at that point, it's actually impeding the free flow of ideas, which the example

2:23:02.840 --> 2:23:06.600
 in your clip that was totally taken out of context.

2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:09.240
 And then you're literally just saying, I'm here to learn and contribute.

2:23:09.240 --> 2:23:10.960
 I think I've got some stuff to do.

2:23:10.960 --> 2:23:11.960
 And then people attack that.

2:23:11.960 --> 2:23:13.680
 Like that doesn't make any fucking sense.

2:23:13.680 --> 2:23:17.960
 It's like you're attacking someone who's approaching it in a good spirit and asking questions.

2:23:17.960 --> 2:23:18.960
 Yeah.

2:23:18.960 --> 2:23:24.720
 And I think sometimes talking about it, the toxicity in the Bitcoin community as an immune

2:23:24.720 --> 2:23:34.160
 response has a negative effect of giving it a pass because it almost says, look, it equates

2:23:34.160 --> 2:23:38.720
 it with the human immune system, which seems to do a really good job.

2:23:38.720 --> 2:23:46.800
 And so you could say that the toxicity has a lot of features in the sea of fraudulent

2:23:46.800 --> 2:23:52.360
 projects that steal money from people.

2:23:52.360 --> 2:23:57.720
 It's really useful to make sure that you give people the harsh truth about who is and isn't

2:23:57.720 --> 2:24:00.200
 a scammer.

2:24:00.200 --> 2:24:05.480
 You have to take it away from that metaphor of the immune system and look at basic human

2:24:05.480 --> 2:24:06.960
 nature.

2:24:06.960 --> 2:24:15.520
 And human nature can go to some dark places, which is it's sad to say that some people,

2:24:15.520 --> 2:24:23.720
 maybe many of us can enjoy for its own sake the toxicity, the mockery, the derision.

2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:31.240
 And you stop being part of the immune system that makes a successful idea propagate and

2:24:31.240 --> 2:24:35.400
 start being a sort of a destructive virus yourself.

2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:43.240
 And that's something I think about because I am new to this particular immune system,

2:24:43.240 --> 2:24:46.480
 but I've explored other immune systems.

2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:56.520
 And I think you understand this world much better than me, but I tend to prefer sort

2:24:56.520 --> 2:25:06.360
 of love as a mechanism for spreading ideas to err on the side of love and kindness and

2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:13.320
 almost like an open mindedness in a way where you're constantly lowering yourself in the

2:25:13.320 --> 2:25:18.000
 face of other ideas, constantly questioning yourself.

2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:25.240
 But I think I understand that that might be more applicable in certain contexts, like

2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:28.240
 maybe in the space of science or something like that.

2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:33.120
 But in the space of Bitcoin, as it currently stands, there's so many people that are trying

2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:38.680
 to scam others out of their money that the kind of harshness required is different.

2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:47.080
 Nevertheless, I do want to put it on people like yourself and others who I know you wouldn't

2:25:47.080 --> 2:25:51.720
 consider yourself this, but you're one of the faces or leaders in this space to call

2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:57.280
 people out a little bit, to inspire them to be more loving, I suppose.

2:25:57.280 --> 2:25:59.800
 But it's difficult because you want to walk that line carefully.

2:25:59.800 --> 2:26:04.760
 You don't want to be too loving and open minded, otherwise your brain falls out.

2:26:04.760 --> 2:26:05.760
 I get it.

2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:07.000
 It's a difficult balance to walk.

2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:11.240
 It is subtle and it's nuanced and it is difficult to walk.

2:26:11.240 --> 2:26:18.000
 And I think that's why I try to say tough love because when we're young, we may have

2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:24.080
 certain ideas about the way we want our life to go, but then maybe our parents are not

2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:27.400
 letting us do certain things and we think they're, I know when I was a kid, I wanted

2:26:27.400 --> 2:26:30.920
 to get my, when I was in fifth grade, I wanted to get my ear pierced, my mom wouldn't let

2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:31.920
 me do it.

2:26:31.920 --> 2:26:34.440
 And I was like, oh, come on, mom, I thought it was so cool.

2:26:34.440 --> 2:26:39.480
 And then two years later, I'm like, thank you, mom, for letting me get my ear pierced.

2:26:39.480 --> 2:26:45.800
 I think it comes from a place of good intention that they are actually, they have asked themselves

2:26:45.800 --> 2:26:51.560
 that question, right, that they've been inquiring and why not this crypto asset or this crypto

2:26:51.560 --> 2:26:52.560
 asset?

2:26:52.560 --> 2:26:53.560
 And they've done the exploration.

2:26:53.560 --> 2:26:59.760
 They keep coming back to Bitcoin and they've seen people being taken advantage of.

2:26:59.760 --> 2:27:06.680
 But you know, to your point, it's like it can, this tough love can become detrimental

2:27:06.680 --> 2:27:09.000
 just like the immune system can become detrimental, right?

2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:12.560
 It can overreact and it can actually harm the human body.

2:27:12.560 --> 2:27:17.160
 So I would say that it's, it's such a tricky and nuanced topic that even biology hasn't

2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:18.160
 figured it out, right?

2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:22.080
 A lot of people have autoimmune diseases.

2:27:22.080 --> 2:27:25.800
 And then there's the other thing that we have this natural, I agree with you about love.

2:27:25.800 --> 2:27:28.800
 I think love is like the deepest value.

2:27:28.800 --> 2:27:34.840
 That's a whole nother philosophical thing, but it's, we're biologically programmed to

2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:39.040
 pay more attention to things that are adversarial or harmful, right?

2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:42.480
 That's part of the, us protecting the meat suit, so to speak.

2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:49.960
 So there is some, maybe better delivery method by being a little bit toxic to really get

2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:53.720
 the point across like, Hey, don't get lost over here.

2:27:53.720 --> 2:27:55.840
 These things can hurt you.

2:27:55.840 --> 2:28:00.680
 Really try to focus on Bitcoin, but the toxicity of that message, I guess it increases its

2:28:00.680 --> 2:28:04.280
 ability to penetrate the individual, but it can also go too far.

2:28:04.280 --> 2:28:05.280
 So it is.

2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:11.120
 It's interesting, but I almost to push back a little bit, toxicity is a funny word.

2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:17.600
 I think a text, maybe another way to say it is, uh, I brought up like Christopher Hitchens

2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:23.800
 and somebody who like, okay, you might say it's toxic or something like that.

2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:28.920
 Cause he's basically a intellectual powerhouse who's also a troll.

2:28:28.920 --> 2:28:33.520
 So he's constantly, it's a guerrilla warfare in the space of ideas.

2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:40.600
 He's very harsh in his disagreements and criticisms, but it's done with incredible grace and skill

2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:42.480
 and poetry.

2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:44.520
 So we could use more of that.

2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:45.880
 We could use more of that.

2:28:45.880 --> 2:28:53.600
 So toxicity just like, um, these are just words.

2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:58.320
 They can mean a lot of different things, but this agreement doesn't have to be done with

2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:04.440
 love, but it should be done with skill if it's to be effective.

2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:09.560
 So there's a lot of ways to be effective in guerrilla warfare, but you want to learn how

2:29:09.560 --> 2:29:12.960
 to shoot or whatever the weapon you're using and to do it well.

2:29:12.960 --> 2:29:17.800
 Some people do better than others and, uh, it's worthwhile to learn to do it well.

2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:24.000
 Again, I prefer love, but even love, you know, just because you think you're communicating

2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:29.160
 a good idea and you're very well, maybe doesn't mean it also doesn't require skill to do the

2:29:29.160 --> 2:29:35.800
 communication well, whether it's this agreement and harsh or more, uh, agreement and loving

2:29:35.800 --> 2:29:36.800
 and so on.

2:29:36.800 --> 2:29:42.960
 Yeah, I think very fundamentally that all of our decisions, you know, we alluded to

2:29:42.960 --> 2:29:47.200
 earlier that every decision is an expression of value or a reaction we take.

2:29:47.200 --> 2:29:49.680
 They ultimately come from fear or love.

2:29:49.680 --> 2:29:55.520
 Fear would be something much more in the biological domain where it's like we're trying to protect

2:29:55.520 --> 2:29:56.520
 ego.

2:29:56.520 --> 2:29:58.520
 We're trying to behave selfishly.

2:29:58.520 --> 2:30:03.280
 This is the domain of sin, you know, I don't know all the sins that gluttony greed, sloth

2:30:03.280 --> 2:30:08.840
 wrath, lust, pride, envy, like these are all selfish behaviors, whereas something like

2:30:08.840 --> 2:30:14.480
 love is much, it's morally superior and that it's more selfless.

2:30:14.480 --> 2:30:18.400
 I don't know that we can properly define love with words at all, but I would say maybe like

2:30:18.400 --> 2:30:22.880
 selfless action could be kind of a generalization of it.

2:30:22.880 --> 2:30:25.640
 And that way it is really hard to your point.

2:30:25.640 --> 2:30:34.520
 It's hard to, to love in a world that has a lot of conflict that might make you fearful

2:30:34.520 --> 2:30:36.200
 if you're really focused on your meat suit.

2:30:36.200 --> 2:30:40.360
 But if you're focused on the bigger picture and you're focused on others and legacy and

2:30:40.360 --> 2:30:43.160
 life that, um, there is a way to do it.

2:30:43.160 --> 2:30:46.800
 And that's why I actually think Christ, that is the highest moral aim, right?

2:30:46.800 --> 2:30:52.680
 He met all of the vitriol in life, you know, betrayal, hate, violence.

2:30:52.680 --> 2:30:55.920
 He met it all with love and he met it with compassion.

2:30:55.920 --> 2:31:01.000
 And that's why, like, regardless of if you believe that he actually lived or any of this,

2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:07.880
 he is symbolic of the highest moral consciousness possible.

2:31:07.880 --> 2:31:14.440
 And you know, Carl Jung would say that that was a suitable alternative to psychoanalysis,

2:31:14.440 --> 2:31:19.200
 was actually setting your moral aim higher and striving towards it diligently.

2:31:19.200 --> 2:31:24.920
 So I mean, I agree completely, we need more of that in the Bitcoin space.

2:31:24.920 --> 2:31:27.480
 We need more of that in the world, frankly.

2:31:27.480 --> 2:31:31.920
 And these things, they're all intertwined, you know.

2:31:31.920 --> 2:31:36.040
 We touched on the beginning, all of us get to decide, but the world does influence kind

2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:39.920
 of if we adopt fear or love.

2:31:39.920 --> 2:31:43.560
 But it takes, I don't know, it takes good systems and it takes, I guess, good leaders

2:31:43.560 --> 2:31:45.320
 to, to set an example.

2:31:45.320 --> 2:31:50.640
 Yeah, I do, I do believe that there's like individual people can have a ripple effect.

2:31:50.640 --> 2:31:55.640
 So that's, that's what I try to do, sort of embody the, I'm just one aunt, but I, one

2:31:55.640 --> 2:32:03.320
 of the things I have faith in is I'm trying to do that more.

2:32:03.320 --> 2:32:10.840
 I know this is a podcast, but I'm trying to do less talking and more doing.

2:32:10.840 --> 2:32:15.480
 I've been disappointed in myself if I'm being honest, how much talking I've been doing,

2:32:15.480 --> 2:32:22.720
 you know, as opposed to like in my private life, I live the thing I talk about, but

2:32:22.720 --> 2:32:29.880
 I also haven't created much, you know, and I believe in the power of individuals that

2:32:29.880 --> 2:32:34.560
 create stuff, I create an idea through those individuals that try to create something new

2:32:34.560 --> 2:32:39.360
 the world progresses and hopefully there's more and more, more and more of those people.

2:32:39.360 --> 2:32:48.240
 So you mentioned kind of people who, what the Bitcoin community might call scammers.

2:32:48.240 --> 2:32:53.880
 I have a lot of passions in my life that I focus a lot of my attention to.

2:32:53.880 --> 2:33:01.320
 You know, Bitcoin doesn't happen to be yet one of them, Bitcoin cryptocurrency, you

2:33:01.320 --> 2:33:08.600
 know, I'm always looking for things to really fall in love with.

2:33:08.600 --> 2:33:15.680
 So how is a person like me supposed to figure out, I also happen to have a platform a little

2:33:15.680 --> 2:33:22.640
 bit and how am I supposed to figure out who is interesting, what is an interesting set

2:33:22.640 --> 2:33:28.560
 of ideas and what or not, because people are financially tied into a lot of the cryptocurrencies

2:33:28.560 --> 2:33:34.360
 that we're talking about, certainly with Bitcoin, you know, their livelihood, their well being

2:33:34.360 --> 2:33:35.440
 is tied up to it.

2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:37.680
 So it becomes much more emotional, much more personal.

2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:41.640
 It's no longer purely an exploration of ideas.

2:33:41.640 --> 2:33:44.920
 It's really almost like a threat on your property.

2:33:44.920 --> 2:33:45.920
 It's a personal threat.

2:33:45.920 --> 2:33:47.960
 It makes it very difficult to explore those ideas.

2:33:47.960 --> 2:33:54.280
 So I understand it, but it makes it very difficult for somebody like me to just walk in and be

2:33:54.280 --> 2:33:55.640
 curious.

2:33:55.640 --> 2:34:03.960
 So how do I proceed in this difficult world in exploring this landscape and not give a

2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:10.840
 platform to ideas that may harm others?

2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:17.280
 I guess first I'd like to commend your forthrightness about this, because I don't think many people

2:34:17.280 --> 2:34:19.440
 try to walk that line necessarily.

2:34:19.440 --> 2:34:24.840
 People, again, kind of the territorial imperative, they'll put whoever on, they'll help expand

2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:25.840
 their reach.

2:34:25.840 --> 2:34:26.840
 Oh yeah, that's right.

2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:29.680
 Or say whatever needs to be said to expand their reach.

2:34:29.680 --> 2:34:33.920
 So I think you're coming from a good place, I'll say that.

2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:38.680
 There's a great piece written on the topic of scammers and scamming.

2:34:38.680 --> 2:34:42.760
 I think it was by Goldstein, he wrote a piece called Everyone's a Scammer.

2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:47.520
 And it's sort of back to this general human proclivity to try and get something for nothing

2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:48.520
 always.

2:34:48.520 --> 2:34:53.720
 But again, it can be positive, it can be innovative, or it can be negative, it can be trying to

2:34:53.720 --> 2:34:58.160
 steal from people.

2:34:58.160 --> 2:35:02.800
 That might be, I think that's a useful piece just to kind of see the crypto world through

2:35:02.800 --> 2:35:06.360
 that lens, and that's how bit corners are thinking all the time.

2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:11.920
 They are by nature adversarial thinkers, so they're trying to minimize the need for trust

2:35:11.920 --> 2:35:17.160
 in any situation and maximize verification.

2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:26.240
 As far as sifting through the ideas, I guess this is back where the cultural immune system

2:35:26.240 --> 2:35:28.640
 has some utility.

2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:34.240
 Because there were times when I thought this particular crypto asset, Auger was one I was

2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:39.760
 really into, that it could facilitate prediction markets, prediction markets could make markets

2:35:39.760 --> 2:35:41.920
 more efficient, et cetera, et cetera.

2:35:41.920 --> 2:35:49.680
 But when that investment thesis basically met the cultural filter or immune system,

2:35:49.680 --> 2:35:54.600
 it forced me to reevaluate my position, forced me to really look into it more deeply.

2:35:54.600 --> 2:35:59.480
 And through that exploration, I realized that it would need to be built on Bitcoin to work,

2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:00.480
 basically.

2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:05.920
 But it really comes down to you doing your homework, but we can't all deeply evaluate

2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:08.280
 every idea out there.

2:36:08.280 --> 2:36:16.760
 One of the things I struggle with, Alex Jones, for example, had dinner with him, I could

2:36:16.760 --> 2:36:19.360
 tell that would be a very fun conversation.

2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:29.240
 But then I also understand that there's consequences to that conversation that should be explored

2:36:29.240 --> 2:36:31.080
 with care.

2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:36.000
 And so you need to take on the responsibility of being a chef or the puffer fish and all

2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:37.760
 those kinds of things.

2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:43.720
 That said, just like you said, it's very difficult to know this ahead of time.

2:36:43.720 --> 2:36:46.880
 And I will probably make mistakes.

2:36:46.880 --> 2:36:51.320
 And that's a shitty thing to have to live with, that I'm going to make mistakes and

2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:53.120
 some of them very large.

2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:57.640
 Like, yeah, I mean, I can imagine a bunch of different ways.

2:36:57.640 --> 2:37:01.000
 But all we can do in this world is want to make the mistakes.

2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:05.160
 We acknowledge those mistakes and learn.

2:37:05.160 --> 2:37:13.840
 And also, I have to put this on the rest of us that you don't take one thing that a person

2:37:13.840 --> 2:37:20.800
 did and then burn them at the stake for it, that you realize that we all make mistakes,

2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:25.720
 that a particular mistake does not make the person.

2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:30.880
 This applies to taking stuff out of context over hundreds of hours of talking, but it

2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:37.560
 applies to actual, in context, big mistake.

2:37:37.560 --> 2:37:39.240
 So what if I murdered somebody at some point?

2:37:39.240 --> 2:37:40.240
 Just give me a break.

2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:41.240
 No.

2:37:41.240 --> 2:37:47.720
 I'm not too far, of course, but in general, we need to give each other a chance, yeah.

2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:54.280
 But I'm still, I walk with a heavy heart knowing that I'll probably make a mistake,

2:37:54.280 --> 2:37:56.720
 especially one that I didn't mean to.

2:37:56.720 --> 2:37:58.560
 That's the one that worries me most.

2:37:58.560 --> 2:38:00.200
 This is human nature.

2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:05.720
 Like, hamartia to miss the mark, that's the root word of sin.

2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:07.400
 We are sinful by nature.

2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:08.400
 We can't help it.

2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:11.160
 There's no way, again, pain is information, right?

2:38:11.160 --> 2:38:18.400
 There's no way to learn other than trying, failing, learning, and then you put yourself

2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:23.000
 in better formation, right, in formation to better deal with it next time.

2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:30.560
 So I hope, I don't get the sense that you're actually afraid of making a mist up.

2:38:30.560 --> 2:38:36.320
 Like I think you just, maybe disappointed is a better word, like you know you're going

2:38:36.320 --> 2:38:37.320
 to make the mistakes.

2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:38.320
 Yeah, exactly.

2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:39.320
 That's a much, much better word.

2:38:39.320 --> 2:38:41.120
 But we have to embrace that, yeah.

2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:44.600
 That's the only way anything, it's the only way we can advance is that we're dealing

2:38:44.600 --> 2:38:46.800
 with an incomprehensible reality.

2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:50.280
 All we can do is throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks.

2:38:50.280 --> 2:38:55.000
 And in that process, we're all inherently going to hurt ourselves and hurt others and

2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:58.040
 that's where love and forgiveness come into play, right?

2:38:58.040 --> 2:39:04.040
 And yeah, I think the other thing is that this culture of reducing people down to a

2:39:04.040 --> 2:39:10.160
 label, right, whether it's racism or whether you're calling them a scammer or any number

2:39:10.160 --> 2:39:14.840
 of terms, you're discounting their sovereignty to zero, right?

2:39:14.840 --> 2:39:21.000
 You're taking a super complex human that is vast, contains multitudes, is changing over

2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:25.760
 time and you're trying to put them in a bucket of a word.

2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:30.520
 And that is just, I think, a cognitive fallacy, like it's not only going to hurt the person

2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:34.720
 that you're, you know, winnowing down to a word, it's also going to hurt you and it's

2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:40.280
 going to, in your attempt to decomplexify reality by assigning this person to a term,

2:39:40.280 --> 2:39:43.880
 you're actually going to create bad outcomes for yourself because you're not going to understand

2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:44.880
 that person.

2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:50.560
 I do also think there's the failure of our social media technology that incentivizes

2:39:50.560 --> 2:39:53.240
 that kind of reduction to a label.

2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:56.880
 It's just the viral nature of that reduction.

2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:04.680
 So not only do we humans naturally do that, our social media platforms make that easier

2:40:04.680 --> 2:40:11.440
 and more fun, more effective to do that at scale, the mass hysteria.

2:40:11.440 --> 2:40:17.840
 So I think there's actually technological ways of adding friction to that.

2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:18.840
 Yeah.

2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:25.120
 I wonder, I mean, I agree with you that it's social media is an amplifier to our natural,

2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:27.280
 this natural way of dealing with one another.

2:40:27.280 --> 2:40:32.240
 But I wonder, am I thinking it has evolved a lot on this, that there's something below

2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:35.200
 the way we're treating each other too, right?

2:40:35.200 --> 2:40:39.600
 We could say civilization sort of advances in the tools we make and the way we treat

2:40:39.600 --> 2:40:40.600
 each other.

2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:45.720
 We tend to have better tools, better quality of life and better morality, better quality

2:40:45.720 --> 2:40:49.280
 of living and ways of dealing with one another.

2:40:49.280 --> 2:40:56.720
 And I think that when you corrupt the money, that it really does push us the negative direction,

2:40:56.720 --> 2:41:06.040
 pushes us away from, again, encouraging or magnifying scarcity artificially causes us

2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:07.600
 to be more divisive.

2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:12.920
 When things are more divisive, we tend to be less civilized, less nuanced, more black

2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:18.080
 or white or this or that or label A or label B.

2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:22.960
 So I really think, and this is a harder one to unravel, but I think if we can fix the

2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:30.320
 money, which again is the base layer operating system for human moral action in the world,

2:41:30.320 --> 2:41:32.680
 that it has downstream effects.

2:41:32.680 --> 2:41:37.360
 So we'd actually maybe start to treat each other a little better on social media, despite

2:41:37.360 --> 2:41:41.280
 the fact that it enables this faster communication.

2:41:41.280 --> 2:41:42.280
 That's interesting.

2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:48.560
 So perhaps fixing social media as I've been thinking about is treating the symptom, not

2:41:48.560 --> 2:41:49.560
 the cause.

2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:50.560
 Yeah.

2:41:50.560 --> 2:41:55.000
 So as the Bitcoin rabbit hole in a nutshell, as they say, fix the money, fix the world,

2:41:55.000 --> 2:42:04.240
 you keep tracing these different social malayses or technological difficulties, lack of innovation.

2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:07.920
 Weinstein's entire portal podcast, something went wrong in the early 70s.

2:42:07.920 --> 2:42:11.360
 We went off the gold standard in 1971.

2:42:11.360 --> 2:42:17.920
 And there's a great website, WTFHap in 1971.com, goes through this whole gamut of socioeconomic

2:42:17.920 --> 2:42:22.640
 data that's completely gone askew since the early 70s.

2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:23.640
 Yeah.

2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:24.640
 You had this whole video.

2:42:24.640 --> 2:42:31.760
 What do you think about Eric Weinstein and Bitcoin and the gold standard?

2:42:31.760 --> 2:42:38.000
 Does he, I actually haven't heard him talk about his thesis about the 70s in connection

2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:41.520
 to the going off of the gold standard.

2:42:41.520 --> 2:42:42.520
 Yeah.

2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:43.520
 What are your thoughts there?

2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:49.640
 What are your thoughts about his general relationship with the Bitcoin idea and the community?

2:42:49.640 --> 2:42:50.640
 Yeah.

2:42:50.640 --> 2:42:54.440
 The first exposure I had to Eric was his, I think it was his first episode with Peter

2:42:54.440 --> 2:42:55.440
 Teal.

2:42:55.440 --> 2:43:00.880
 And they're going through that thesis that there's been this general institutional rot

2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:05.840
 and suppression of innovation since the early 70s, and he's trying to identify what it is.

2:43:05.840 --> 2:43:11.480
 I don't think they ever pended on the money on going off the gold standard.

2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:17.600
 But in recent interactions with Eric, I've interacted with him on Clubhouse.

2:43:17.600 --> 2:43:22.960
 We recently released an episode of the show I did with Chris Espley, and it was titled

2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:24.360
 Dear Eric Weinstein.

2:43:24.360 --> 2:43:28.440
 So we're going through his worldview that he's expressed in the portal and tying it

2:43:28.440 --> 2:43:31.920
 back to the money in different ways.

2:43:31.920 --> 2:43:33.560
 And he's been, he's engaged.

2:43:33.560 --> 2:43:36.760
 Eric retweeted the show, we exchanged some messages.

2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:38.440
 He's been very open minded.

2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:40.520
 He's asked some really good questions.

2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:45.960
 So I get the sense that he's approaching this very wholeheartedly.

2:43:45.960 --> 2:43:50.800
 He does bring with him his existing worldview and his existing theory, the one that really

2:43:50.800 --> 2:43:52.160
 blew up was gauge theory.

2:43:52.160 --> 2:43:53.160
 They got really popular.

2:43:53.160 --> 2:43:55.200
 I don't know a lot about gauge theory.

2:43:55.200 --> 2:44:00.600
 Actually, message Eric and said, I want to learn more, genuinely, because he seems to

2:44:00.600 --> 2:44:04.040
 be serious that that needs to be considered in the sphere of money.

2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:06.880
 And so I want to learn more about it.

2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:08.240
 But I think overall, it's great.

2:44:08.240 --> 2:44:14.240
 It's great to see an intellectual heavyweight of his caliber gravitating towards Bitcoin.

2:44:14.240 --> 2:44:15.560
 Yeah.

2:44:15.560 --> 2:44:23.960
 He has some gauge theoretic conceptions about the world broadly, but also about economics,

2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:29.640
 which ultimately boils down to just a set of mathematics, which allows you to more effectively

2:44:29.640 --> 2:44:30.800
 reason about the world.

2:44:30.800 --> 2:44:33.840
 And he has a certain set of views there.

2:44:33.840 --> 2:44:37.080
 So it's fascinating to see him grapple with it.

2:44:37.080 --> 2:44:43.800
 I think he's also kind of actually kind of like all of us grappling with the idea of what

2:44:43.800 --> 2:44:45.880
 is Bitcoin in this world?

2:44:45.880 --> 2:44:54.440
 It's a very young technology and it's unclear exactly how the ideas of the past fit with

2:44:54.440 --> 2:44:57.520
 it and integrate, how the two integrate together.

2:44:57.520 --> 2:45:01.480
 And so it's interesting to explore, not just Bitcoin, the particular.

2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:11.000
 So for me, what I've always saw Bitcoin as from the beginning, from a narrow worldview

2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:14.160
 is computer science, which is where I come from.

2:45:14.160 --> 2:45:21.720
 And so I wasn't almost aware in the social, political, financial aspects of Bitcoin.

2:45:21.720 --> 2:45:29.360
 But now I see that there's not just power, but there's fascinating ideas to explore on

2:45:29.360 --> 2:45:30.360
 that side of things.

2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:35.800
 Not just the computer science, not just the technical details, but the political, the

2:45:35.800 --> 2:45:39.720
 socioeconomic, the philosophical.

2:45:39.720 --> 2:45:44.280
 That's where I find all the fascination in the world, frankly.

2:45:44.280 --> 2:45:51.000
 I would, one other thing about Weinstein and Intellectuals more generally that are skeptical

2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:57.440
 of Bitcoin, I would challenge them to read the book, Human Action, written by Mises.

2:45:57.440 --> 2:46:03.880
 I think in 1949, he published the English version, it's essentially the Bible of Austrian

2:46:03.880 --> 2:46:04.880
 economics.

2:46:04.880 --> 2:46:13.760
 And I think Austrian economics is a noticeable gap in most modern intellectuals worldviews

2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:15.120
 that is not taught in school.

2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:18.520
 I mean, I have a master's degree in accounting and finance, I studied a lot of economics

2:46:18.520 --> 2:46:19.520
 in school.

2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:21.120
 There's not one peep of Austrian icon.

2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:22.120
 Oh yeah.

2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:26.440
 I really love talking about all the degrees he has.

2:46:26.440 --> 2:46:30.360
 I was a CPA.

2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:38.760
 But that curriculum that we get in college is noticeably deficient in Austrian economics.

2:46:38.760 --> 2:46:40.600
 And I think there's a reason why.

2:46:40.600 --> 2:46:44.160
 It's heavily government influenced.

2:46:44.160 --> 2:46:48.840
 Again, master's degree in accounting, they never taught me about what money is or where

2:46:48.840 --> 2:46:50.080
 money comes from.

2:46:50.080 --> 2:46:56.080
 All you learn is that the central bank issues money and the central bank takes money away.

2:46:56.080 --> 2:47:02.080
 So it's conceived of in the textbooks quite literally as God, an entity that suffers no

2:47:02.080 --> 2:47:09.320
 opportunity cost, that basically is the foundation of the entire Keynesian worldview that you're

2:47:09.320 --> 2:47:11.160
 taught in economics.

2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:16.360
 And Austrian economics is the opposite end of the spectrum of that.

2:47:16.360 --> 2:47:21.080
 It's actually the culmination, which economics is the youngest science in the world, by the

2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:22.080
 way.

2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:28.320
 It's kind of the front, it's the frontiers of science in many ways, like to actually,

2:47:28.320 --> 2:47:31.380
 when I say praxeology, many people have never even heard of that.

2:47:31.380 --> 2:47:37.400
 But it's something, it's an a priori study equivalent to something like mathematics,

2:47:37.400 --> 2:47:42.760
 that you're building things from first principles to reason about economic reality.

2:47:42.760 --> 2:47:49.160
 And I think that book, it's a very difficult book written by Mises, 1200 pages, translated

2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:50.160
 from German.

2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:54.120
 He wields English, is fascinating and terrifying all at the same time.

2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:58.240
 It'll probably take you six months to read it, if you read it daily, seriously, like

2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:00.640
 it's a beast of a book.

2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:06.080
 But that will plug the gap, I think in most, any intellectual that's skeptical about Bitcoin,

2:48:06.080 --> 2:48:09.880
 I think that will plug the gap that's necessary for you to see it in a new light.

2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:12.680
 Well, I'll take that as a challenge.

2:48:12.680 --> 2:48:16.000
 Now that we took a little bit of a break, it's some good Texas brisket.

2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:17.000
 Thank you for that, by the way.

2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:18.000
 I'm over.

2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:19.000
 Quite welcome.

2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:21.840
 Let me ask the ridiculous question.

2:48:21.840 --> 2:48:28.480
 At the core of the idea of Bitcoin is this guy or this entity named Satoshi Nakamoto.

2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:32.320
 So the ridiculous question is, who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

2:48:32.320 --> 2:48:35.160
 And first of all, is it you?

2:48:35.160 --> 2:48:37.360
 It's not me.

2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:38.360
 I wish.

2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:43.480
 And is this an interesting question, or is it just something about our human nature that

2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:47.280
 wants to, that always tends towards mystery?

2:48:47.280 --> 2:48:56.040
 Well, as we've touched on a bit today, mythology, in my opinion, is something that is intrinsic

2:48:56.040 --> 2:48:58.400
 to how we see the world in a lot of ways.

2:48:58.400 --> 2:49:05.560
 It's kind of the structure by which we build these useful fictions.

2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:12.280
 And so in that way, you could just say that Satoshi is the godhead of Bitcoin, effectively.

2:49:12.280 --> 2:49:17.020
 And I think a compelling argument could be made that his disappearance is what really

2:49:17.020 --> 2:49:20.480
 solidifies Bitcoin's decentralization.

2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:30.240
 Because if there were one individual to personally vilify or denigrate or attack to disparage

2:49:30.240 --> 2:49:38.120
 or question the motives of, if he's out on the Hollywood Hills partying, everyone knows

2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:40.560
 he's got a million Bitcoin.

2:49:40.560 --> 2:49:44.240
 It would just kind of tarnish the entire project a lot of way.

2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:49.660
 But the fact that on that theme, something for nothing, this guy actually gave humanity

2:49:49.660 --> 2:49:51.560
 something for nothing.

2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:57.000
 And it appears that he didn't profit in any way.

2:49:57.000 --> 2:50:03.160
 He, she, or they actually heard recently that he identified as a he and some of his communications.

2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:05.480
 So it sounds like it is a he.

2:50:05.480 --> 2:50:13.760
 See, like his communications being like studied like almost like exactly as if he is a religious

2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:15.640
 that's right.

2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:16.640
 Like a prophet.

2:50:16.640 --> 2:50:17.640
 Yeah.

2:50:17.640 --> 2:50:27.280
 I mean, it's fascinating to imagine that he's still alive and living in this world.

2:50:27.280 --> 2:50:31.320
 And it's even more fascinating to imagine that he's perhaps participating in the Bitcoin

2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:37.720
 community because I mean, that's, that takes a special human being to how to principle

2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:41.520
 do that, to do, to, to remain anonymous.

2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:43.160
 That's very much the George Washington.

2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:44.160
 Yeah.

2:50:44.160 --> 2:50:46.600
 I always wonder like how many people are like that?

2:50:46.600 --> 2:50:51.640
 There's a cliche that like absolute power corrupts, absolutely like power corrupts,

2:50:51.640 --> 2:50:58.520
 but it seems like the progress of humanity depends on the people whom power doesn't corrupt.

2:50:58.520 --> 2:51:04.600
 And it's enough to have just a small selection of those.

2:51:04.600 --> 2:51:12.680
 And even if most of us are too weak, we give in to power, if given the chance, all it takes

2:51:12.680 --> 2:51:13.680
 is a few.

2:51:13.680 --> 2:51:18.400
 That's, I've never thought of it like that, but Marcus Aurelius immediately came to mind.

2:51:18.400 --> 2:51:25.320
 You know, the guy that he had the keys to the kingdom and he apparently adhered to the

2:51:25.320 --> 2:51:28.680
 historic virtues until the end.

2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:34.880
 But yeah, I agree with Satoshi, the other thing that's interesting is he would be by

2:51:34.880 --> 2:51:41.360
 far the most wealthy person in the world on a liquid asset basis, because he has a million

2:51:41.360 --> 2:51:47.960
 Bitcoin, which is 60 billion liquid net worth at current prices.

2:51:47.960 --> 2:51:53.920
 So if he is still alive and just operating in the world, he is daily and moment to moment

2:51:53.920 --> 2:52:01.280
 resisting massive incentives to go and just be the richest guy in the world.

2:52:01.280 --> 2:52:02.920
 He's the ultimate hodler.

2:52:02.920 --> 2:52:03.920
 Yeah.

2:52:03.920 --> 2:52:04.920
 Yeah.

2:52:04.920 --> 2:52:11.920
 I mean, so it's, I mean, it's turning down not just financial success, but also fame.

2:52:11.920 --> 2:52:14.280
 I mean, fame is another drug.

2:52:14.280 --> 2:52:19.320
 It's kind of power, but it's in itself is also a drug, especially in this modern society

2:52:19.320 --> 2:52:20.600
 in this attention.

2:52:20.600 --> 2:52:21.600
 And he would have both.

2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:23.000
 He would have both.

2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:25.960
 It's fun to imagine who it could be.

2:52:25.960 --> 2:52:30.680
 It's fascinating if it's somebody like you or somebody like Elon or somebody like that.

2:52:30.680 --> 2:52:31.680
 That's fascinating to think about.

2:52:31.680 --> 2:52:32.680
 Yeah.

2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:37.280
 I think Elon would be hilarious if he came out and he was Satoshi and be like, Hey guys,

2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:40.560
 I know I'm already the richest guy in the world, but I'm going to go ahead and double

2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:42.560
 my lead here.

2:52:42.560 --> 2:52:49.680
 What do you make of Elon Musk investing with Tesla investing in Bitcoin and maybe broaden

2:52:49.680 --> 2:52:57.160
 that out in some of these other, you know, big billionaires, but also people tied to

2:52:57.160 --> 2:52:59.400
 major companies investing in Bitcoin.

2:52:59.400 --> 2:53:00.400
 Yeah.

2:53:00.400 --> 2:53:04.160
 I think Michael Saylor really led the charge on that.

2:53:04.160 --> 2:53:10.280
 He's the CEO of MicroStrategy that I think they've acquired upwards of $2 billion in

2:53:10.280 --> 2:53:11.280
 Bitcoin now.

2:53:11.280 --> 2:53:16.080
 Started acquiring August, maybe of 2020.

2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:19.160
 And he's, you know, personally bought a lot of it.

2:53:19.160 --> 2:53:24.280
 He bought a lot as a treasury reserve asset for his company, MicroStrategy.

2:53:24.280 --> 2:53:28.400
 Then they leveraged up on a convertible note and bought more.

2:53:28.400 --> 2:53:36.240
 So he's really gone, really leading the charge in this Bitcoin institutional adoption.

2:53:36.240 --> 2:53:41.240
 Your conversation with him is a really interesting one, your series of, I mean, series of episodes

2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:44.400
 I suppose, but it's only a couple of conversations, I guess.

2:53:44.400 --> 2:53:45.400
 Yeah.

2:53:45.400 --> 2:53:50.000
 He recorded twice, five and a half hours each, so it's about 11 hours of content.

2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:51.000
 And yeah, thank you.

2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:56.560
 It's, a lot of people have said that it's the best first principle thing they've ever

2:53:56.560 --> 2:53:59.280
 seen on Bitcoin, which I take no credit for that at all.

2:53:59.280 --> 2:54:03.120
 I mean, I just sat down with a guy and unleashed him.

2:54:03.120 --> 2:54:04.120
 He's just a beast.

2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:05.120
 Yeah.

2:54:05.120 --> 2:54:14.360
 But it's fascinating that his long term vision with it, I mean, I'm not sure I'm all first

2:54:14.360 --> 2:54:23.120
 softly bought in, but if he's right, if this set of ideas are as powerful as he describes

2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:28.280
 as he described that this would change the world, which as you say, it's funny that a

2:54:28.280 --> 2:54:38.920
 company like MicroStrategy might be the company that has the biggest macro effect on our economy

2:54:38.920 --> 2:54:40.080
 and our world.

2:54:40.080 --> 2:54:41.080
 Yeah.

2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:48.200
 And the conversation reshaped my worldview a lot too, because he framed money as energy,

2:54:48.200 --> 2:54:53.040
 which I had often thought of money as time and it explored those connections a lot in

2:54:53.040 --> 2:55:00.480
 my writing, but looking at it as energy and then his supposition that the purpose of life

2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:03.240
 is to basically channel energy across space and time.

2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:07.080
 So we're just trying to figure out how to channel more energy across space and time

2:55:07.080 --> 2:55:10.200
 toward the satisfaction of aims.

2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:14.000
 And his definition, his answer to that question, what is money?

2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:17.240
 Money is the highest form of energy a human being can channel.

2:55:17.240 --> 2:55:20.880
 So it's a claim to all other forms of energy we can manifest in the world.

2:55:20.880 --> 2:55:28.320
 And that just completely reshaped how I see it, brought in this whole other side to my

2:55:28.320 --> 2:55:30.280
 intellectual explorations of money.

2:55:30.280 --> 2:55:32.240
 Can you elaborate on that a little bit?

2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:38.560
 So I understand money is time, which in itself is a really powerful idea, but money is energy,

2:55:38.560 --> 2:55:39.560
 channeling energy.

2:55:39.560 --> 2:55:40.560
 Okay.

2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:41.560
 Can you break that apart?

2:55:41.560 --> 2:55:42.560
 Yeah.

2:55:42.560 --> 2:55:47.000
 So I guess I definitely have to check out the whole series to really get his perspective,

2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:51.560
 but I'll do my best to condense it.

2:55:51.560 --> 2:55:56.680
 Life itself, all forms of life are, you know, they're dependent on energy, right?

2:55:56.680 --> 2:56:02.400
 Energy fuels everything fuels life and action and motion and all of that.

2:56:02.400 --> 2:56:10.440
 And we could say that maybe like a plant is harnessing solar energy and then reallocating

2:56:10.440 --> 2:56:11.920
 that into growth.

2:56:11.920 --> 2:56:15.240
 So it's aim is to grow towards the sun, right?

2:56:15.240 --> 2:56:22.600
 So it's allocating energy towards its goal of harnessing more solar energy kind of thing.

2:56:22.600 --> 2:56:33.000
 And humans too have evolved to figure out how to harness energy in different ways to

2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:35.280
 satisfy higher and more complicated aims.

2:56:35.280 --> 2:56:41.200
 So the original energy network that he referenced was fire, right?

2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:45.800
 We actually learned to wield fire as a tool in and of itself.

2:56:45.800 --> 2:56:51.240
 So not only are we learning to channel energy, but we actually learned how to isolate energy

2:56:51.240 --> 2:56:53.880
 as a tool in and of itself.

2:56:53.880 --> 2:57:00.120
 So we went into that, how harnessing fire had changed human beings.

2:57:00.120 --> 2:57:06.960
 Actually, this is one of the earliest examples too of a co evolution between tool and our

2:57:06.960 --> 2:57:12.640
 biology because when we developed fire, we developed cooking and cooking is you can kind

2:57:12.640 --> 2:57:16.560
 of think of it as pre digestion in a way or liberating these macro nutrients or making

2:57:16.560 --> 2:57:22.000
 things that otherwise would not be digestible, edible.

2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:26.200
 And it increases the efficiency by which we extract nutrients from food.

2:57:26.200 --> 2:57:27.560
 That's what cooking does.

2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:33.640
 So when we figured out cooking, we free, we liberated all these digestive resources that

2:57:33.640 --> 2:57:36.680
 were reallocated towards higher cognitive development.

2:57:36.680 --> 2:57:43.200
 So there's this evolutionary path between figuring out fire and us becoming smarter,

2:57:43.200 --> 2:57:46.000
 which was interesting.

2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:51.800
 Some other early examples he gave, he went into were missiles and hydraulics.

2:57:51.800 --> 2:57:58.160
 So missiles being, we learned to hunt at a distance, you know, we can't bring down a

2:57:58.160 --> 2:58:05.560
 woolly mammoth maybe with spears and up close and personal force, but we could with spears

2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:07.960
 and javelins and slings and whatnot.

2:58:07.960 --> 2:58:13.800
 And then he went into how we've used water to channel hydraulic energy so we can basically

2:58:13.800 --> 2:58:21.000
 overcome gravity, we can move, you know, there's theories that the pyramids were constructed

2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:25.880
 using the blocks were moved using hydraulic energy or using water.

2:58:25.880 --> 2:58:29.800
 Clearly we use like cargo ships and whatnot to move things much more efficiently across

2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:32.520
 water than we could the land.

2:58:32.520 --> 2:58:38.360
 So this, his whole view is how we keep figuring out better ways and more efficient ways to

2:58:38.360 --> 2:58:40.640
 harness energy and channel it.

2:58:40.640 --> 2:58:48.440
 And in that perspective, money has always represented a claim on all other forms of

2:58:48.440 --> 2:58:49.440
 energy.

2:58:49.440 --> 2:58:54.760
 So whatever energy couldn't be channeled towards something useful in the economy historically

2:58:54.760 --> 2:58:56.320
 would go into gold mining.

2:58:56.320 --> 2:59:04.120
 So gold became this residual, this economic, this token of the excess energy created by

2:59:04.120 --> 2:59:05.640
 the market economy.

2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:10.200
 And then you could take that token of energy and use it to redeem for any other form of

2:59:10.200 --> 2:59:13.720
 energy or any of the products of energy itself.

2:59:13.720 --> 2:59:18.280
 So it's, I guess it's my best approximation of it.

2:59:18.280 --> 2:59:23.680
 And it just really shattered my worldview again, because I'd always thought about it as time

2:59:23.680 --> 2:59:28.560
 like we spend time sacrificing to obtain money that we then redeem for commencement sacrifices

2:59:28.560 --> 2:59:32.480
 from others, but I'd never considered it purely as energy.

2:59:32.480 --> 2:59:38.840
 And then it also ties back into gold where there was an energy expenditure necessary

2:59:38.840 --> 2:59:40.360
 to obtain gold.

2:59:40.360 --> 2:59:44.680
 So there's a proof of work associated with obtaining gold that protected its market

2:59:44.680 --> 2:59:45.680
 value.

2:59:45.680 --> 2:59:46.680
 Right?

2:59:46.680 --> 2:59:50.920
 So you had to expend, again, if market value of gold is 2000 an ounce, you had to expend

2:59:50.920 --> 2:59:53.280
 1900 an ounce mining.

2:59:53.280 --> 2:59:56.680
 So it kept producers honest in a way.

2:59:56.680 --> 3:00:07.840
 So do you think something like proof of stake that's more about reputation than actual exertion,

3:00:07.840 --> 3:00:10.200
 like energy can work?

3:00:10.200 --> 3:00:11.200
 No.

3:00:11.200 --> 3:00:13.800
 I think proof of stake is inherently centralizing.

3:00:13.800 --> 3:00:21.200
 It's like the old Matthew principle from those who have to those who have more will

3:00:21.200 --> 3:00:24.280
 be given from those who have not everything will be taken.

3:00:24.280 --> 3:00:26.520
 That's what proof of stake is.

3:00:26.520 --> 3:00:33.520
 You need proof of work to embody skin in the game in the marketplace such that contributions

3:00:33.520 --> 3:00:36.600
 are commensurate with consideration received.

3:00:36.600 --> 3:00:39.760
 That's how systems work.

3:00:39.760 --> 3:00:49.680
 What's the idea why proof of work might incentivize decentralization?

3:00:49.680 --> 3:00:56.920
 Do you worry that as Bitcoin becomes more powerful, it may become, again, more centralized?

3:00:56.920 --> 3:01:04.240
 Well, the decentralization of Bitcoin is largely driven by the nodes, actually, which

3:01:04.240 --> 3:01:05.320
 aren't actually mining.

3:01:05.320 --> 3:01:10.800
 They're just choosing which rule set to implement.

3:01:10.800 --> 3:01:14.720
 And then the mining network is actually enforcing that rule set.

3:01:14.720 --> 3:01:23.280
 So I think the mining network is inherently decentralized in that really anyone with access

3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:25.600
 to cheap energy can become a miner.

3:01:25.600 --> 3:01:31.000
 You can freely enter or exit the market or the network at any time.

3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:38.120
 But maintaining the block size at a manageable level is what's key to maintaining node decentralization.

3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:40.640
 This is an interesting question.

3:01:40.640 --> 3:01:44.400
 Who do you think has more power, the miners or the nodes?

3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:52.640
 Because the nodes carry the idea of the protocol, the specifics.

3:01:52.640 --> 3:01:57.480
 So in some sense, they have more power if Bitcoin is an idea.

3:01:57.480 --> 3:02:04.680
 They're kind of mutually indispensable, though, because you can't have, there's no security

3:02:04.680 --> 3:02:06.080
 without the miners.

3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:08.600
 So without the miners, Bitcoin is just an idea.

3:02:08.600 --> 3:02:13.400
 And the idea of Bitcoin has maybe existed even before Bitcoin, right?

3:02:13.400 --> 3:02:14.400
 Just sound money.

3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:16.960
 We just say sound money is an idea.

3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:24.480
 But there was no way to root that into thermodynamic reality without Satoshi figuring out not just

3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:31.520
 proof of work, it's the entire composite of the difficulty adjustment, proof of work,

3:02:31.520 --> 3:02:32.920
 one way hashing, et cetera.

3:02:32.920 --> 3:02:37.520
 So I don't know, that's hard to say, hard to disentangle the two.

3:02:37.520 --> 3:02:41.480
 You've talked about money as morality, too.

3:02:41.480 --> 3:02:47.480
 How do you think about moral and immoral action in the context of money?

3:02:47.480 --> 3:02:53.040
 There's this great, great quote by Rothbard, who's a famous Austrian economist.

3:02:53.040 --> 3:03:01.240
 And he says, quote, to be moral, an act must be free, unquote.

3:03:01.240 --> 3:03:15.800
 And I think morality, it changes over time, and it has its roots in biology.

3:03:15.800 --> 3:03:21.280
 Jordan Peterson makes the point that even animals have their own sort of pseudo morality,

3:03:21.280 --> 3:03:27.280
 or with wolf packs, for instance, if there's a dispute between the alpha males, or I guess

3:03:27.280 --> 3:03:35.600
 between an alpha male and an incumbent, the two males will have a fight, basically.

3:03:35.600 --> 3:03:40.880
 And then when one is decided that one has won, the loser will basically roll over and

3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:45.280
 give up his neck to the alpha male.

3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:50.040
 And they do this instead of fighting to the death, because in a wolf pack, they need every

3:03:50.040 --> 3:03:52.800
 wolf so they can go out and bring down.

3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:55.880
 You never know when you're going to need the 20th wolf to bring down the big buffalo

3:03:55.880 --> 3:03:57.080
 the next day or whatever.

3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:03.800
 So they've developed this less than fight to the death social morality to optimize their

3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:07.960
 effectiveness as a wolf pack.

3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:16.240
 And similarly for humans, our morality sort of emerges through competition and play even.

3:04:16.240 --> 3:04:21.960
 There are these implicit rules that come into place based on how we're organizing ourselves

3:04:21.960 --> 3:04:24.360
 over time.

3:04:24.360 --> 3:04:34.560
 And so with money, it's interesting because most tools we would consider to be amoral,

3:04:34.560 --> 3:04:39.880
 as in a hammer can be used to build a house, which could be seen to be good, like a good

3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:43.680
 constructive purpose, or it could be used to bash someone's skull, which could be something

3:04:43.680 --> 3:04:51.640
 evil and that the tool itself is amoral, doesn't have any independent morality of its own.

3:04:51.640 --> 3:04:55.520
 All of the morality is associated with the wielder of the tool.

3:04:55.520 --> 3:05:01.600
 So what's the quote like any tool can be a weapon if you hold it right sort of thing.

3:05:01.600 --> 3:05:12.400
 But money's maybe a little bit different in that when you monopolize money, it's only

3:05:12.400 --> 3:05:15.440
 useful as a tool for one thing.

3:05:15.440 --> 3:05:19.600
 And that's for allocating wealth away from some and to others.

3:05:19.600 --> 3:05:24.680
 So it is the only utility of monopolized money is theft.

3:05:24.680 --> 3:05:29.000
 There's no other, you know, there's a lot of propaganda out there that will say, oh,

3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:36.840
 we need to print money to get out of this disaster or to give to the poor, whatever this, whatever

3:05:36.840 --> 3:05:44.040
 moralistically camouflaged political aim is being discussed at the base layer of monopolized

3:05:44.040 --> 3:05:48.000
 money is that it's only useful for taking from someone giving to others.

3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:55.320
 So another way to think about this is that money is a paper claim on the savings of society.

3:05:55.320 --> 3:06:00.960
 So it is just a ticket for redeeming savings, which could be time, could be capital, could

3:06:00.960 --> 3:06:04.740
 be knowledge from any market actor in the world.

3:06:04.740 --> 3:06:08.200
 So it's kind of a list of who owns what, if you will, it's a proxy list.

3:06:08.200 --> 3:06:14.240
 If there's one group that can amend that list and others cannot, then they're basically

3:06:14.240 --> 3:06:20.520
 able and incentive to modify that list to their own benefit.

3:06:20.520 --> 3:06:23.220
 And that's effectively what a central bank is doing.

3:06:23.220 --> 3:06:27.240
 So a central bank is determining how much money to create.

3:06:27.240 --> 3:06:30.640
 They're also determining who gets to receive that money first.

3:06:30.640 --> 3:06:36.280
 And the first recipients of that money are going to be the beneficiaries in an inflationary

3:06:36.280 --> 3:06:37.440
 regime.

3:06:37.440 --> 3:06:40.760
 So those that receive the money last are the ones being robbed.

3:06:40.760 --> 3:06:46.720
 Those that receive the money first are the ones that are receiving the stolen proceeds,

3:06:46.720 --> 3:06:48.800
 let's say.

3:06:48.800 --> 3:07:00.600
 And this has a really corrosive effect on social morality because if we consider that

3:07:00.600 --> 3:07:06.920
 people's time horizon, which they also call the time preference, the more short term thinking

3:07:06.920 --> 3:07:12.880
 you are, the more likely you are to engage in selfish behavior.

3:07:12.880 --> 3:07:20.520
 If you know that it's all over tomorrow, you've been working your whole life to develop this

3:07:20.520 --> 3:07:24.140
 business or create this reputation or whatever your thing is, but you just are given the

3:07:24.140 --> 3:07:28.320
 foreknowledge that tomorrow it's all going to end, you're much more likely to go out

3:07:28.320 --> 3:07:34.400
 and just maybe get drunk and party that night because there's no more repercussions.

3:07:34.400 --> 3:07:40.600
 Whereas if you know that you're going to live for a very long time, you're much more likely

3:07:40.600 --> 3:07:44.000
 to plan for the future.

3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:46.400
 And money is very...

3:07:46.400 --> 3:07:51.200
 So we would just say that your time horizon is closely related to your morality, the longer

3:07:51.200 --> 3:07:54.600
 term thinking you are, the more moral you would tend to behave, the more you would care

3:07:54.600 --> 3:07:59.200
 about long term relationship building versus going out and getting wasted.

3:07:59.200 --> 3:08:06.040
 And money too impinges very closely on our time preference and time preference is the

3:08:06.040 --> 3:08:07.040
 Austrian term.

3:08:07.040 --> 3:08:11.640
 So low time preference means you're long term oriented, high time preference means you're

3:08:11.640 --> 3:08:18.960
 short term oriented, which can be a little trippy for some people because it sounds backwards.

3:08:18.960 --> 3:08:27.120
 If your money constantly loses value, you are incentivized to become more short term oriented.

3:08:27.120 --> 3:08:34.960
 You are handicapped in your ability to plan for the future because your money, which is

3:08:34.960 --> 3:08:35.960
 intended to be...

3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:39.880
 Here's another definition of money as an insurance policy against uncertainty.

3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:44.040
 So no matter what problems you encounter in the world, this money will best help you deal

3:08:44.040 --> 3:08:46.560
 with those problems.

3:08:46.560 --> 3:08:51.440
 And that insurance policy against uncertainty is injected with uncertainty, it's polluted

3:08:51.440 --> 3:08:53.600
 with the uncertainty of inflation.

3:08:53.600 --> 3:08:58.280
 Your time horizon shrinks, your ability to plan long term shrinks.

3:08:58.280 --> 3:09:00.240
 And this impinges on social morality.

3:09:00.240 --> 3:09:05.320
 So there's a great book on this called Honest Money by Gary North.

3:09:05.320 --> 3:09:09.840
 And in that book, he gives the parable of the winemaker.

3:09:09.840 --> 3:09:16.200
 The winemaker, if we just imagine the hypothetical winemaker operating a business and essentially

3:09:16.200 --> 3:09:18.240
 a banked economy.

3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:21.840
 And let's say his central bank just doubled the money supply to quote unquote save the

3:09:21.840 --> 3:09:27.200
 economy, say an increase in money supply from $1 to $2 trillion.

3:09:27.200 --> 3:09:31.680
 This winemaker that's accustomed to selling wine at $20 a bottle is now faced with basically

3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:36.760
 three choices.

3:09:36.760 --> 3:09:40.680
 And an important point here too, before we get into his three choices, are what prices

3:09:40.680 --> 3:09:41.960
 are themselves.

3:09:41.960 --> 3:09:46.360
 Prices are the most visible aspect of any service.

3:09:46.360 --> 3:09:51.480
 So when you increase prices, you are incentivizing your customers to look elsewhere.

3:09:51.480 --> 3:09:53.660
 They're going to look at your competition.

3:09:53.660 --> 3:09:59.320
 When you decrease prices, you're incentivizing market actors to look closer at your product.

3:09:59.320 --> 3:10:02.280
 You're delivering a solution at a lower price.

3:10:02.280 --> 3:10:07.320
 So this winemaker that's accustomed to selling his wine at a $20 price point, all of a sudden

3:10:07.320 --> 3:10:12.280
 because of his central bank has tripled the money supply, he has three choices.

3:10:12.280 --> 3:10:18.400
 He can either keep selling his bottle at $20 and all of his inputs will increase due to

3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:21.240
 inflation by 50%.

3:10:21.240 --> 3:10:26.440
 So he will lose 50% of his profit margin as a result.

3:10:26.440 --> 3:10:28.400
 So we can choose to eat that loss.

3:10:28.400 --> 3:10:33.720
 He can choose to double the selling price of his bottle of wine from $20 to $40 because

3:10:33.720 --> 3:10:39.600
 all of the price of his inputs doubled, so then he would maintain his profit margin.

3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:47.440
 Or the third one is that he could choose to water down his wine or use inferior ingredients.

3:10:47.440 --> 3:10:53.800
 So he could use cheaper inputs and maintain the output at the same price.

3:10:53.800 --> 3:10:58.120
 So he could basically start selling his customers an inferior product for the same price to

3:10:58.120 --> 3:11:00.680
 preserve his profit margin.

3:11:00.680 --> 3:11:04.120
 Now again, case number one, it's not very palatable.

3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:06.120
 He doesn't want to eat the economic loss.

3:11:06.120 --> 3:11:10.560
 Case number two, it's not very good either because he's incentivizing all of his customers

3:11:10.560 --> 3:11:14.300
 to go shop other winemakers if he doubles his price.

3:11:14.300 --> 3:11:19.520
 So human nature being what it is, trying to get something for nothing, inflation actually

3:11:19.520 --> 3:11:26.080
 seeps into other industries by encouraging producers into option three, which is to deceive

3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:28.160
 your customer in the short run.

3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:31.120
 And again, this would be done initially at the margins.

3:11:31.120 --> 3:11:35.440
 Maybe it's just a few drops of water, maybe it's just some cheaper grapes.

3:11:35.440 --> 3:11:44.480
 But over time, this inflation is actually inducing producers to weigh their financial

3:11:44.480 --> 3:11:47.400
 well being against their moral integrity.

3:11:47.400 --> 3:11:53.560
 So it's forcing them into this dilemma that would not exist in a free market economy.

3:11:53.560 --> 3:12:01.200
 And as they charge more money for wine that is inferior, the buyers of that wine also

3:12:01.200 --> 3:12:05.120
 living in a central bank economy are also getting scammed by not only the inflation

3:12:05.120 --> 3:12:06.520
 but also the wine.

3:12:06.520 --> 3:12:14.480
 So it becomes this kind of corrosive, contagious moral effect that propagates throughout an

3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:15.480
 economy.

3:12:15.480 --> 3:12:22.400
 And that's why I've argued in a lot of my writing that inflation is this infectious moral cancer

3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:24.040
 on the world.

3:12:24.040 --> 3:12:34.240
 I think it is tied back to a lot of the social strangeness we've seen in modern times where

3:12:34.240 --> 3:12:38.040
 there seems to be a lot of fake people and a lot of fake businesses and a lot of scams,

3:12:38.040 --> 3:12:39.040
 all of these things.

3:12:39.040 --> 3:12:41.280
 I think it really is rooted in the money.

3:12:41.280 --> 3:12:47.760
 And Bitcoin as the first money in history that has a 0% terminal inflation rate or said

3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:50.560
 differently, zero unexpected inflation.

3:12:50.560 --> 3:12:54.360
 There's no theft integrated into Bitcoin.

3:12:54.360 --> 3:12:59.800
 You can only earn it through work or sacrificing resources to obtain it.

3:12:59.800 --> 3:13:06.200
 It is the antidote to this moral cancer that inflation riddles our society with.

3:13:06.200 --> 3:13:12.080
 Again, you're blowing my mind a little bit to think about the ripple effects of inflation,

3:13:12.080 --> 3:13:15.160
 the way it seeps through with our interactions.

3:13:15.160 --> 3:13:21.600
 So at the very, the early ripples is the effect that has on the products, on the dilution

3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:23.160
 of the wine.

3:13:23.160 --> 3:13:30.320
 But also you might have ripple effects on the character, on the behavior of people.

3:13:30.320 --> 3:13:37.760
 That's interesting, artificial creation of scarcity, creating, having effects on society

3:13:37.760 --> 3:13:39.800
 at the social, like the social fabric.

3:13:39.800 --> 3:13:44.040
 And I guess you're arguing the morality.

3:13:44.040 --> 3:13:48.400
 It's perverting free market dynamics, which again, we said free markets generate pragmatic

3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:49.400
 truth.

3:13:49.400 --> 3:13:55.000
 So inflation distorts price signals, which means it confuses capital allocation.

3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:59.080
 So we're trying to solve problems, but all of a sudden, we can't tell if this price increases

3:13:59.080 --> 3:14:03.640
 a matter of true supply and demand change or a matter of policy change.

3:14:03.640 --> 3:14:07.280
 So it clouds our economic perceptions.

3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:12.680
 It suppresses innovation because now you've exacerbated the boom and bust business cycle.

3:14:12.680 --> 3:14:16.880
 People are going to overborrow and go into projects that they can't profitably sustain.

3:14:16.880 --> 3:14:18.400
 So then there will be a huge collapse.

3:14:18.400 --> 3:14:24.160
 So that actually breaks the market's function of generating innovation.

3:14:24.160 --> 3:14:30.000
 And then yeah, I would argue too that it pollutes our pursuit of virtue, let's say.

3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:33.400
 Maybe it's pushing back, but I don't think so.

3:14:33.400 --> 3:14:37.360
 It's not as clear to me, perhaps because I haven't thought about it deeply, that money

3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:43.640
 is core to life and human interaction.

3:14:43.640 --> 3:14:48.760
 Because there might be other forces, other fraudulent forces, other things in human nature

3:14:48.760 --> 3:14:51.240
 that are creating these effects as well.

3:14:51.240 --> 3:14:54.440
 So it's clear, I think you're articulating really well that there's these negative effects

3:14:54.440 --> 3:14:56.120
 from inflation.

3:14:56.120 --> 3:15:01.920
 I wonder if there's other undiscovered, not undiscovered, but ones we're not making explicit

3:15:01.920 --> 3:15:09.840
 now forces that are creating all the things we're seeing now, like you said, cancer culture

3:15:09.840 --> 3:15:11.640
 and all those things.

3:15:11.640 --> 3:15:19.520
 But also the negative effects on the quality of products, on the excellence of the creativity

3:15:19.520 --> 3:15:21.160
 and the innovation, all those kinds of things.

3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:23.560
 I wonder if there's other factors.

3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:27.920
 It's kind of, listen, it's compelling to think money is at the core of it all.

3:15:27.920 --> 3:15:30.560
 Like if you fix, I forgot what the phrase was.

3:15:30.560 --> 3:15:31.920
 Fix the money, fix the world.

3:15:31.920 --> 3:15:35.000
 Yeah, fix the money, fix the world.

3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:40.640
 Again, things that sound good I'm skeptical of by nature.

3:15:40.640 --> 3:15:46.080
 So I wonder if there's other things that are beyond money that are somehow deeply integrated

3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:47.520
 into our human nature.

3:15:47.520 --> 3:15:51.720
 Another one related to money is social cohesion itself.

3:15:51.720 --> 3:16:00.280
 So very simple anecdote for this was the more you increase the inflation rate, social cohesion

3:16:00.280 --> 3:16:02.200
 is inversely proportionate to that.

3:16:02.200 --> 3:16:07.200
 So the extreme example would be hyperinflation, where the money is produced in such excess

3:16:07.200 --> 3:16:09.880
 that it loses all meaning and relevance.

3:16:09.880 --> 3:16:15.600
 So today in Venezuela, there is cash clogging the gutters, clogging the streets, clogging

3:16:15.600 --> 3:16:21.400
 the sewer system, because the cash has lost all relevance.

3:16:21.400 --> 3:16:27.280
 And so anecdotally, we would suspect that, okay, if there's a inverse relationship between

3:16:27.280 --> 3:16:32.920
 inflation and social cohesion, if we could then intake inflation to zero, couldn't we

3:16:32.920 --> 3:16:38.680
 theoretically increase social cohesion to its maximum?

3:16:38.680 --> 3:16:45.080
 So another way to say that is inflation is a decivilizing force, whereas natural price

3:16:45.080 --> 3:16:49.720
 deflation, which would occur in a hard money economy where there's either a fixed supply

3:16:49.720 --> 3:16:58.200
 of Bitcoin or a relatively scarce supply of gold, for instance, that lays claim to an

3:16:58.200 --> 3:17:02.240
 increasing capital stock of goods and services.

3:17:02.240 --> 3:17:06.200
 Prices would naturally decline every year as we became smarter.

3:17:06.200 --> 3:17:09.920
 So the market price becomes a reflection of our collective knowledge.

3:17:09.920 --> 3:17:16.200
 So by letting prices decline naturally over time, we can actually induce civilization.

3:17:16.200 --> 3:17:20.040
 But by trying to force prices higher all the time via the central bank, we're creating

3:17:20.040 --> 3:17:21.920
 the opposite effect.

3:17:21.920 --> 3:17:25.720
 So we talked a little bit about the Soviet Union, and I happened to have lived through

3:17:25.720 --> 3:17:28.840
 the collapse of the Soviet Union.

3:17:28.840 --> 3:17:38.400
 And so what are the factors, the causes in your mind to why the Soviet Union collapsed?

3:17:38.400 --> 3:17:47.320
 So definitely a multivariate situation, I think there's a lot of factors.

3:17:47.320 --> 3:17:51.480
 One that jumped out to me recently, again, from the documentary that I didn't note before,

3:17:51.480 --> 3:18:00.120
 was that at one point Stalin eliminated, I think, 75% of his intelligence force, which

3:18:00.120 --> 3:18:06.760
 I think when you're competing with another nation state, intelligence and covert operations

3:18:06.760 --> 3:18:08.800
 are very integral to your survival.

3:18:08.800 --> 3:18:13.840
 I think that was definitely a shot in the foot.

3:18:13.840 --> 3:18:23.600
 But at a higher level, I would say that capitalism and communism were each resource strategies

3:18:23.600 --> 3:18:27.880
 of the 20th century nation state.

3:18:27.880 --> 3:18:31.600
 And they seem, you know, we commonly consider them to be diametrically opposed, but there's

3:18:31.600 --> 3:18:34.800
 actually a lot of commonality between the two.

3:18:34.800 --> 3:18:41.880
 The difference would be that in Soviet Russia, as we alluded to earlier, they tried to completely

3:18:41.880 --> 3:18:46.880
 replace price signals with this nationalistic faith and devotion.

3:18:46.880 --> 3:18:52.800
 So they removed the economic nerve signal, which coordinated the allocation of capital

3:18:52.800 --> 3:18:53.800
 over time.

3:18:53.800 --> 3:18:57.080
 So this inhibited their ability to generate wealth.

3:18:57.080 --> 3:19:02.440
 Whereas in the United States, we left most markets open to free enterprise.

3:19:02.440 --> 3:19:08.920
 So we honored the integrity of price signals, and we allowed people to trade and accumulate

3:19:08.920 --> 3:19:11.800
 wealth.

3:19:11.800 --> 3:19:17.080
 So in every market, except the market for money, both markets maintained a central bank,

3:19:17.080 --> 3:19:18.400
 as we've gotten to.

3:19:18.400 --> 3:19:27.480
 So I think in a really big picture standpoint, that's why capitalism outcompetes communism

3:19:27.480 --> 3:19:33.640
 is because it is able to generate more wealth than communism was, and therefore was able

3:19:33.640 --> 3:19:40.920
 to put financial pressure on the USSR until it reached the point of bankruptcy, essentially.

3:19:40.920 --> 3:19:49.520
 This a similar model, I would argue, is that for the same reasons we saw capitalism outcompete

3:19:49.520 --> 3:19:56.640
 communism, which I think the data that I recall was that the USSR's economy was valued at

3:19:56.640 --> 3:19:59.720
 close to one third of its inputs.

3:19:59.720 --> 3:20:04.080
 So if you just didn't do anything inside the USSR and just sold all the raw materials

3:20:04.080 --> 3:20:09.160
 that were going into it, it would have been worth three times as much as sending the materials

3:20:09.160 --> 3:20:12.360
 in, running it through the efforts, and then shipping things back out.

3:20:12.360 --> 3:20:16.320
 It was value destructive versus value creative.

3:20:16.320 --> 3:20:22.120
 And I would argue this is because, again, the centralized computing model versus decentralized

3:20:22.120 --> 3:20:27.960
 computing model, it just became more and more corrupt over time.

3:20:27.960 --> 3:20:32.040
 It got to the point where I think most of the occupations in the USSR towards the end

3:20:32.040 --> 3:20:34.200
 were as informants.

3:20:34.200 --> 3:20:37.200
 They were working for the state.

3:20:37.200 --> 3:20:40.680
 Jordan Peterson makes this point, too, that at some point it was actually illegal to be

3:20:40.680 --> 3:20:47.280
 sad in Soviet Russia, because if you were sad, you were contradicting the utopian view

3:20:47.280 --> 3:20:48.960
 of the state.

3:20:48.960 --> 3:20:52.080
 So if you were sad, you're implying the state's not doing something wrong.

3:20:52.080 --> 3:20:57.040
 But by the way, this does remind me, do you know what Jordan Peterson thinks about Bitcoin

3:20:57.040 --> 3:21:02.800
 and about the future impact of Bitcoin on the society?

3:21:02.800 --> 3:21:07.160
 No, I don't, actually.

3:21:07.160 --> 3:21:10.720
 We're hopefully going to be talking to him soon about that.

3:21:10.720 --> 3:21:16.280
 We did a book club on his book Maps of Meaning, and he engaged with us about it.

3:21:16.280 --> 3:21:19.120
 So we're hoping to deliver the orange pill to Mr. Peterson.

3:21:19.120 --> 3:21:20.640
 The orange pill.

3:21:20.640 --> 3:21:27.280
 I think his audience is one of the most important audiences in the world to understand Bitcoin.

3:21:27.280 --> 3:21:34.600
 People that are conscientious and responsible, I think they'll quickly understand Bitcoin's

3:21:34.600 --> 3:21:38.160
 value proposition and help elucidate it to the world.

3:21:38.160 --> 3:21:41.000
 I'm trying to remember what he said about it.

3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:47.280
 Basically, I think his support of Bitcoin is grounded in the kind of people who are

3:21:47.280 --> 3:21:50.880
 opposing Bitcoin.

3:21:50.880 --> 3:21:55.440
 Without understanding Bitcoin, he starts to like Bitcoin because of the people who are

3:21:55.440 --> 3:21:58.760
 opposing it.

3:21:58.760 --> 3:22:03.840
 You start to, I mean, that's partially why I am interested in Bitcoin.

3:22:03.840 --> 3:22:13.080
 It's like all the people in power and all the kind of shady, fraudulent, and nongenuine

3:22:13.080 --> 3:22:19.480
 people who are dismissing Bitcoin are making me think, hmm.

3:22:19.480 --> 3:22:26.800
 One of Jordan's definitions of God is, he says God is found in the truthful speech that

3:22:26.800 --> 3:22:30.520
 rectifies pathological hierarchies.

3:22:30.520 --> 3:22:36.760
 And I think that is a beautiful definition of what Bitcoin is doing in the world and

3:22:36.760 --> 3:22:42.320
 that we have this pathological hierarchy called central banking by which the rich get richer

3:22:42.320 --> 3:22:45.120
 and the poor get poorer.

3:22:45.120 --> 3:22:52.680
 That is used as a mechanism for perpetual theft and funding warfare at a global scale.

3:22:52.680 --> 3:22:57.720
 Like Ron Paul said, it's no coincidence that the 20th century of total war was also the

3:22:57.720 --> 3:23:00.880
 century of central banking.

3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:08.680
 When you have an institution of currency counterfeiting, which the central bank is, you are no longer

3:23:08.680 --> 3:23:11.480
 bounded by your own balance sheet when you go to war.

3:23:11.480 --> 3:23:13.520
 You don't have to just go to war on your own resources.

3:23:13.520 --> 3:23:20.360
 You can now pillage the commonwealth and pull for the savings of society as a whole before

3:23:20.360 --> 3:23:21.360
 you go bankrupt.

3:23:21.360 --> 3:23:28.200
 And indeed, this is what Hitler did, right, Hitler hyperinflated in the Weimar Republic

3:23:28.200 --> 3:23:31.840
 to fund his war efforts.

3:23:31.840 --> 3:23:38.760
 And frankly, every dictator, every world war, every internment camp in history was made

3:23:38.760 --> 3:23:43.520
 possible by the weaponization of money in fiat currency.

3:23:43.520 --> 3:23:49.800
 So I hope, I know Jordan Peterson is a huge proponent of free speech, and I think that's

3:23:49.800 --> 3:23:53.200
 ultimately at its deep essence, that's what Bitcoin really is, right?

3:23:53.200 --> 3:23:58.880
 It is just the purest form of monetary speech we've ever had.

3:23:58.880 --> 3:24:06.120
 And by purifying that primary operating system of human action, I think we can eliminate

3:24:06.120 --> 3:24:11.360
 this pathological hierarchy that is unfortunately the dominant institution in the world today.

3:24:11.360 --> 3:24:12.360
 Yeah.

3:24:12.360 --> 3:24:18.400
 I'm definitely, especially with these explorations of Bitcoin, this journey I've been on, I'll

3:24:18.400 --> 3:24:23.440
 revisit some of the aspects of human history that I've been looking at, like Stalin and

3:24:23.440 --> 3:24:33.240
 Hitler, from a perspective of a monetary perspective, like what are the effects of inflation?

3:24:33.240 --> 3:24:43.200
 How was it used as a tool in gaining power, in maintaining power, in manipulating the populace,

3:24:43.200 --> 3:24:51.560
 in doing, in inflicting suffering, and I would say evil onto the world?

3:24:51.560 --> 3:24:53.800
 It's interesting.

3:24:53.800 --> 3:24:54.800
 It's interesting.

3:24:54.800 --> 3:24:57.000
 I'm gonna have to sort of go back into the whole.

3:24:57.000 --> 3:25:06.560
 So I tend to focus more on the human nature, and less about the tools that human nature

3:25:06.560 --> 3:25:15.200
 leverages to effect change, but you're right that in some sense money is a tool which can

3:25:15.200 --> 3:25:23.120
 be effectively used to perform moral and immoral actions, depending on how it's used.

3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:25.920
 And there's a feedback between the two, right?

3:25:25.920 --> 3:25:39.760
 Because specifically with money itself, there's the way I've been posing it lately, is that

3:25:39.760 --> 3:25:44.600
 I actually think, we typically think of people as good or bad, or again, trying to label

3:25:44.600 --> 3:25:49.480
 people all the time, but I think people and their characters are emergent properties

3:25:49.480 --> 3:25:52.720
 of the incentive structures they inhabit.

3:25:52.720 --> 3:25:57.960
 So what does Charlie Munger say, show me the incentives, I'll show you the outcome kind

3:25:57.960 --> 3:25:59.800
 of thing.

3:25:59.800 --> 3:26:03.600
 This is a flawed incentive structure we've been operating within.

3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:07.680
 Now I'm not speaking to the intention, people want to argue with me all the time, like Jerome

3:26:07.680 --> 3:26:11.760
 Powell's not a bad guy, he's doing his best at the central bank, he's doing what he thinks

3:26:11.760 --> 3:26:13.600
 is right, that's fine.

3:26:13.600 --> 3:26:16.360
 Whether that's true or not, it actually doesn't matter.

3:26:16.360 --> 3:26:19.040
 The intention is divergent from the outcome.

3:26:19.040 --> 3:26:24.080
 The institution that they are running is premised on deception and theft, and it is handicapping

3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:25.640
 the productive economy.

3:26:25.640 --> 3:26:30.560
 So even the terms we use, printing money, you're not creating any new value, you're

3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:34.560
 not infusing the economy with anything, any new productive factors whatsoever, you're

3:26:34.560 --> 3:26:39.680
 just harvesting the economic surplus created by entrepreneurs in the marketplace.

3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:45.840
 It's impossible to add any value to an economy by increasing the paper claims on its savings.

3:26:45.840 --> 3:26:53.280
 So there's a feedback loop between man and tool, between creator and created.

3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:59.240
 I think we have to honor the relationship above either one, trying to put the right

3:26:59.240 --> 3:27:03.360
 people in the system or just build the right system, we need both.

3:27:03.360 --> 3:27:10.320
 Do you think the interesting question of whether the people that are in control of central

3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:17.880
 banks or in positions of power there, if they themselves are malevolent, if they themselves

3:27:17.880 --> 3:27:28.600
 are bad actors, or they're simply like leaves floating along the river, sort of just a cog

3:27:28.600 --> 3:27:34.880
 in the machine, an ant in an ant colony that operates in a certain kind of way.

3:27:34.880 --> 3:27:36.760
 Where do you put the blame?

3:27:36.760 --> 3:27:43.160
 Do you put the blame on the way things are operating onto the individuals or onto the

3:27:43.160 --> 3:27:50.880
 system itself, the idea behind the system, where is it useful to place the blame somewhere?

3:27:50.880 --> 3:27:55.880
 Because for me, it might be useful to understand that in order to figure out what the solution

3:27:55.880 --> 3:27:57.040
 is.

3:27:57.040 --> 3:28:02.560
 I tend to not put the blame on the individual, I tend to believe most people are good and

3:28:02.560 --> 3:28:05.680
 want to see themselves as good.

3:28:05.680 --> 3:28:09.920
 And so in that case, it's very difficult to be truly malevolent as you would need to

3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:15.000
 be to control, to gain centralized power at the large scale.

3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:22.840
 But I know a lot of conspiracy theorists and just a lot of people think that there is evil

3:28:22.840 --> 3:28:28.040
 humans in the world that seek power, maintain that power and then use that power for bad

3:28:28.040 --> 3:28:30.680
 purposes.

3:28:30.680 --> 3:28:34.680
 I think they're just people and they're just trying to get something for nothing like all

3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:35.680
 of us do.

3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:38.280
 I like this framework of thought.

3:28:38.280 --> 3:28:44.080
 Honestly, and that's what the central bank is, is the ultimate institution to get something

3:28:44.080 --> 3:28:45.280
 for nothing.

3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:52.600
 You get a perpetual income stream, the ability to acquire more and more territory in the

3:28:52.600 --> 3:29:00.160
 world through monopolizing the supply of money and you can literally print money.

3:29:00.160 --> 3:29:04.640
 You can buy your way out of anything and buy your way into anything in the world.

3:29:04.640 --> 3:29:11.720
 So it is, I think the most, I'd say the most, but a group of very intelligent people put

3:29:11.720 --> 3:29:18.600
 this thing together and figured out how to get something for nothing in perpetuity by

3:29:18.600 --> 3:29:21.760
 clouding people's conception of money.

3:29:21.760 --> 3:29:27.800
 And if we look at the central bank, it's been around for a while, but the latest implementation

3:29:27.800 --> 3:29:30.680
 here in the US is the Fed, it's about 100 years old.

3:29:30.680 --> 3:29:36.600
 It's an analog age institution that I think has lost a lot of its relevance in the modern

3:29:36.600 --> 3:29:43.040
 age and I don't think it will survive the ever galvanizing gaze of the digital age or

3:29:43.040 --> 3:29:48.760
 just too much sunlight, too much transparency today, ideas move too quickly for something

3:29:48.760 --> 3:29:51.480
 like this to remain relevant.

3:29:51.480 --> 3:29:56.320
 But they are just people, they are just seeking something for nothing, but I think when you

3:29:56.320 --> 3:30:00.960
 concentrate that much power and that much control, that much wealth into the hands of

3:30:00.960 --> 3:30:05.040
 few, it does change.

3:30:05.040 --> 3:30:11.640
 Hayek argued that the nature of power, again, it's something that we all sort of desire.

3:30:11.640 --> 3:30:14.080
 To be completely powerless, you're really unhappy.

3:30:14.080 --> 3:30:16.600
 If you're totally powerless, you're a slave.

3:30:16.600 --> 3:30:20.680
 Someone else tells you what to do, you have no autonomy, it's miserable.

3:30:20.680 --> 3:30:25.440
 So there's this, it makes the consolidation of power alluring and that we want to protect

3:30:25.440 --> 3:30:28.560
 ourselves from that slave state, let's say.

3:30:28.560 --> 3:30:31.760
 But like many things, it can be taken too far.

3:30:31.760 --> 3:30:38.560
 And when you concentrate power into too few hands, Hayek argues that it actually transforms.

3:30:38.560 --> 3:30:42.380
 It becomes something much more intoxicating than it would be if it was held in a more

3:30:42.380 --> 3:30:44.440
 distributed way.

3:30:44.440 --> 3:30:50.080
 And I think that gets into a lot of these, I don't know if they call themselves elites

3:30:50.080 --> 3:30:55.160
 or people call them elites or what are like, let's say shareholders of central banks, people

3:30:55.160 --> 3:30:59.320
 participating in the World Economic Forum, things like this.

3:30:59.320 --> 3:31:04.160
 They come, I guess the incentives, right, the incentive schema they're in is rewarding

3:31:04.160 --> 3:31:08.080
 them constantly, telling them everything they're doing, saying and thinking is correct because

3:31:08.080 --> 3:31:10.960
 they just keep getting richer all the time.

3:31:10.960 --> 3:31:19.280
 And it leads you closer to this definition of evil, which in the book Paradise Lost,

3:31:19.280 --> 3:31:23.840
 Friedman said, evil is the force which believes its knowledge is complete.

3:31:23.840 --> 3:31:31.480
 So these people become more and more convinced that they have the plan or they have the course

3:31:31.480 --> 3:31:35.920
 of action that will save the world, that if everyone would just listen to them, that they

3:31:35.920 --> 3:31:38.120
 would lead us to the promised land, right?

3:31:38.120 --> 3:31:43.800
 Whether this is Bill Gates saving us from a climate crisis or any of these other economic

3:31:43.800 --> 3:31:49.200
 policies that are targeted at a certain outcome, but almost always diverge almost perfectly

3:31:49.200 --> 3:31:53.520
 from that outcome, creating its opposite effect.

3:31:53.520 --> 3:31:58.720
 I think that's the problem, that we have this mechanism that can concentrate wealth and

3:31:58.720 --> 3:32:06.000
 power into the hands of so few that it leads to the proliferation of evil, meaning that

3:32:06.000 --> 3:32:12.720
 it convinces people that their knowledge is complete, whereas something like a Bitcoin

3:32:12.720 --> 3:32:17.560
 almost forces the opposite outcome.

3:32:17.560 --> 3:32:24.600
 In a Bitcoin denominated world, a pure free market, the consumer is sovereign.

3:32:24.600 --> 3:32:30.920
 So you cannot earn value in the world unless you are serving your fellow man, unless they

3:32:30.920 --> 3:32:35.880
 have expressed their buy and sell decisions in the marketplace, right?

3:32:35.880 --> 3:32:42.000
 You've created a satisfaction of a particular want that they value so much, they've acquired

3:32:42.000 --> 3:32:45.240
 so much of your good or service that you've become rich.

3:32:45.240 --> 3:32:49.000
 You can only maintain that position of wealth so long as you continue to serve your fellow

3:32:49.000 --> 3:32:50.520
 man.

3:32:50.520 --> 3:32:59.120
 It changes the incentive such that dominance in the world can no longer be paired with coercion.

3:32:59.120 --> 3:33:03.200
 It has to be paired with competence.

3:33:03.200 --> 3:33:06.560
 That's how this, when we say Bitcoin fixes this, that's what we mean.

3:33:06.560 --> 3:33:11.680
 It restores that skin in the game, that balance of incentives and disincentives that help

3:33:11.680 --> 3:33:18.240
 us properly navigate reality and it prevents the buildup of systemic rot like we see with

3:33:18.240 --> 3:33:20.440
 the central bank.

3:33:20.440 --> 3:33:25.920
 What books, people love this question and you're exceptionally well read.

3:33:25.920 --> 3:33:28.400
 You've explored all kinds of ideas.

3:33:28.400 --> 3:33:35.040
 Is there some books, technical fiction, philosophical, coloring books, children's books had an impact

3:33:35.040 --> 3:33:41.080
 on your life and you would maybe recommend to others that they should read?

3:33:41.080 --> 3:33:46.760
 I think we mentioned a couple of them here today, but I think a really useful triplet

3:33:46.760 --> 3:33:55.080
 of books that I've been recommending recently to help diffuse this materialist worldview

3:33:55.080 --> 3:34:03.480
 of reality where we still think in the Newtonian model that it's atoms and cause and effect.

3:34:03.480 --> 3:34:07.720
 I'd first recommend Jordan Peterson's book, Maps of Meaning.

3:34:07.720 --> 3:34:14.560
 It's a deep dive into mythology and how it's developed over the course of history and how

3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:21.520
 it's reflected both in our social structures and our intracyclic nature, really, and how

3:34:21.520 --> 3:34:25.720
 they come to reflect one another in a way, like the way we think, again, shapes the world

3:34:25.720 --> 3:34:29.920
 and then the way the world is shaped the way we think.

3:34:29.920 --> 3:34:30.920
 That's an excellent book.

3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:33.160
 It's a very dense and difficult read.

3:34:33.160 --> 3:34:35.240
 Actually, this trilogy is pretty brutal.

3:34:35.240 --> 3:34:39.440
 It'll probably take you a year to read hours a day.

3:34:39.440 --> 3:34:44.640
 The second one I mentioned earlier was Human Action by Mises.

3:34:44.640 --> 3:34:50.160
 The ultimate tome on Austrian economics will help explicate this realm of relevance.

3:34:50.160 --> 3:34:58.720
 I think that economics truly is where, again, there are things and then these things become

3:34:58.720 --> 3:35:03.760
 means or ends once we channel our purpose through them.

3:35:03.760 --> 3:35:10.400
 This realm of nonmaterialist relevance that I think is really important to grasping economics

3:35:10.400 --> 3:35:15.600
 at a first principles level, I think that book lays it out tremendously.

3:35:15.600 --> 3:35:18.440
 The last one would be, I think I mentioned this at the beginning, was that book Leela

3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:24.040
 by Robert Persig, where he's making the case that value is fundamental.

3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:27.640
 All of these books, they all point to that, actually.

3:35:27.640 --> 3:35:33.440
 They're pointing back to value being the fundamental thing.

3:35:33.440 --> 3:35:39.280
 It's expressed through moral action as being the fundamental substrate of reality.

3:35:39.280 --> 3:35:42.120
 If you're like me, I grew up quite scientific minded.

3:35:42.120 --> 3:35:47.760
 It'll help diffuse some of that and maybe retrain you to the other side of reality.

3:35:47.760 --> 3:35:49.480
 You said these books are difficult.

3:35:49.480 --> 3:35:52.920
 Maybe you can comment on which aspect is difficult.

3:35:52.920 --> 3:35:54.400
 Is it just the technical nature?

3:35:54.400 --> 3:35:55.480
 Is it the length?

3:35:55.480 --> 3:35:59.440
 Is it the depth of the ideas or how long it takes to integrate them?

3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:08.840
 More importantly, is there recommendation advice you can give on how to integrate these

3:36:08.840 --> 3:36:13.920
 ideas, how to read, how to learn in this space?

3:36:13.920 --> 3:36:17.080
 From your own life, how do you enjoy taking ideas?

3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:22.240
 This could be for these books, but also in the Bitcoin world and reading a bunch of different

3:36:22.240 --> 3:36:28.440
 ideas written by others, just integrating stuff, even watching podcasts and all those

3:36:28.440 --> 3:36:29.440
 kinds of things.

3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:30.440
 Yeah.

3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:31.440
 I'm a reader.

3:36:31.440 --> 3:36:32.440
 I love to read.

3:36:32.440 --> 3:36:38.920
 One of the most useful things I've ever done was take a speed reading course.

3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:41.640
 I actually think there's a version of this available on Tim Ferriss's website.

3:36:41.640 --> 3:36:43.680
 It's like a 30 minute speed reading course.

3:36:43.680 --> 3:36:45.920
 It's all about eye movement.

3:36:45.920 --> 3:36:49.960
 Instead of moving your eye continuously, line over line, it's more about jumping in

3:36:49.960 --> 3:36:50.960
 your brain.

3:36:50.960 --> 3:36:55.360
 You can train your brain to just absorb words in their totality versus kind of reading word

3:36:55.360 --> 3:37:03.640
 by word and also not... I've haven't fully taken that journey actually, but I remember

3:37:03.640 --> 3:37:09.120
 taking a few steps on that journey, realizing that I'm speaking inside my head.

3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:12.320
 I'm saying the words inside my head and that's actually getting in the way.

3:37:12.320 --> 3:37:13.320
 That's right.

3:37:13.320 --> 3:37:15.080
 There's a lot of little hacks like that.

3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:21.240
 I may be lazily... Now that you mentioned, I'll have to revisit this, but I have convinced

3:37:21.240 --> 3:37:25.480
 myself that I don't need to read faster because that's not ultimately the bottleneck.

3:37:25.480 --> 3:37:28.280
 The bottleneck is in me thinking about stuff.

3:37:28.280 --> 3:37:33.720
 In fact, I like reading really slowly or so I convinced myself because ultimately it's

3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:35.600
 not about gaining more information.

3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:40.440
 It's about time spent thinking deeply.

3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:44.240
 But maybe that's just me being very lazy because yes, it's true.

3:37:44.240 --> 3:37:49.480
 It's important to think deeply, but maybe I could speed up the consumption of information.

3:37:49.480 --> 3:37:51.480
 It's fun.

3:37:51.480 --> 3:37:54.160
 I like to be dynamic actually.

3:37:54.160 --> 3:37:58.600
 Usually speed reading initially and that diffused that internal dialogue for me because when

3:37:58.600 --> 3:38:00.400
 I was reading one word at a time, I was having that too.

3:38:00.400 --> 3:38:02.320
 You almost get a feedback in your own head.

3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:04.800
 You're reading the word out loud and it's outing your thoughts.

3:38:04.800 --> 3:38:07.040
 If you're speed reading, you can't do that.

3:38:07.040 --> 3:38:13.280
 You're taking in groups of words at a time so you can't internally verbalize it, I guess.

3:38:13.280 --> 3:38:17.720
 Then I also am really big on annotating, underlining, writing in the margins.

3:38:17.720 --> 3:38:23.360
 I prefer a physical book, but I also read the Kindle a lot because it's just so convenient.

3:38:23.360 --> 3:38:27.640
 Anywhere you're waiting in line or every night before bed, I'm reading my Kindle.

3:38:27.640 --> 3:38:30.320
 I also advocate rereading a lot.

3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:36.240
 If you found something that struck you at a deep level, you found particularly fascinating,

3:38:36.240 --> 3:38:37.680
 you have to listen to that.

3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:43.720
 That's your mind or your spirit signal that that is something meaningful to you and you

3:38:43.720 --> 3:38:52.360
 should, to your point, reread it, sit with it for a long time, write about it.

3:38:52.360 --> 3:38:57.560
 That becomes the ultimate triumvirate of synthesizing an idea actually.

3:38:57.560 --> 3:39:03.760
 If you can read about it and then write about it and then go and talk about it, you get

3:39:03.760 --> 3:39:07.920
 this crystallization of understanding that's just not possible doing any one of the three

3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:10.800
 or any two of the three.

3:39:10.800 --> 3:39:15.160
 I definitely highly recommend people to do that.

3:39:15.160 --> 3:39:22.760
 In terms of how are those books difficult, in every way, they're all long books.

3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:32.280
 In terms of density, I would say Leela is the least dense, maybe maps of meaning.

3:39:32.280 --> 3:39:37.880
 I don't know, maps of meaning and human action both extremely dense.

3:39:37.880 --> 3:39:40.640
 I had to read those books very slow.

3:39:40.640 --> 3:39:42.760
 You just have to take your time with them.

3:39:42.760 --> 3:39:47.160
 To give you an idea with Jordan Peterson, he said this a lot with maps of meaning.

3:39:47.160 --> 3:39:51.240
 He spent three hours a day writing for 15 years to write that book.

3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:53.440
 I think it's a 600 page book.

3:39:53.440 --> 3:39:59.680
 He said he estimates he rewrote every sentence in the book 50 times, 5, 0, to try and get

3:39:59.680 --> 3:40:02.760
 it just perfected.

3:40:02.760 --> 3:40:09.600
 When you read these sentences, you can tell that he rewrote it 50 times.

3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:14.120
 I've used actually Anki for space repetition.

3:40:14.120 --> 3:40:15.120
 It's an app.

3:40:15.120 --> 3:40:22.400
 I'm not sure if you're familiar with it, but it allows you to load in facts or terms or

3:40:22.400 --> 3:40:31.600
 entire paragraphs and then you review them every day and then it brings them up less

3:40:31.600 --> 3:40:38.360
 and less often over time as you show yourself being able to remember the thing that you

3:40:38.360 --> 3:40:39.920
 wanted to memorize.

3:40:39.920 --> 3:40:45.240
 Oftentimes, what I'm reading, what I want to memorize is the key idea, but also I use

3:40:45.240 --> 3:40:46.240
 it for...

3:40:46.240 --> 3:40:50.440
 I'm terrible with names, so I started to use it for names too, of names of people, names

3:40:50.440 --> 3:40:56.200
 of people that I want to remember and also throughout history and also in my personal

3:40:56.200 --> 3:40:58.400
 life, but also events.

3:40:58.400 --> 3:41:03.840
 Dates to me are usually not important, but sometimes dates are really important.

3:41:03.840 --> 3:41:04.840
 It's really useful.

3:41:04.840 --> 3:41:05.840
 I'd recommend it highly.

3:41:05.840 --> 3:41:13.720
 I think mentioned a piece of software called ReadWise or something like that, that I hope

3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:14.720
 I'm saying that correctly.

3:41:14.720 --> 3:41:16.800
 It's something like that.

3:41:16.800 --> 3:41:23.080
 What it does is it goes to your highlights from your Kindle or the various places where

3:41:23.080 --> 3:41:30.080
 you highlight stuff that integrates with good reads and it does the same kind of space repetition,

3:41:30.080 --> 3:41:33.160
 but for things you've highlighted.

3:41:33.160 --> 3:41:36.480
 It sends an email every day.

3:41:36.480 --> 3:41:37.480
 It's been really...

3:41:37.480 --> 3:41:44.560
 I recommend it highly because it sends to me an email form, a selection of the things

3:41:44.560 --> 3:41:51.040
 I've highlighted and previous things I've read, and it's like this weird shock to your

3:41:51.040 --> 3:41:58.160
 memory that sprinkles like, I'll probably weigh too much Orwell in there, and it just

3:41:58.160 --> 3:42:03.900
 kind of brings you back and these ideas there because what you realize, depending on how

3:42:03.900 --> 3:42:08.960
 you highlight, but at least for me, and I think it's probably true for a lot of people,

3:42:08.960 --> 3:42:14.600
 the things you've highlighted had at that moment an emotional impact on you.

3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:16.720
 These things are just hitting you hard again.

3:42:16.720 --> 3:42:22.360
 It's like, whoa, it might not be meaningful to anyone else except you, and it's something

3:42:22.360 --> 3:42:23.360
 I recommend.

3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:29.400
 You never know with these hacks or tools and so on what's actually BS and what is amazing

3:42:29.400 --> 3:42:31.520
 and that one is kind of amazing.

3:42:31.520 --> 3:42:35.920
 So at least for me, it works for me and Naval, I think he's the one.

3:42:35.920 --> 3:42:37.080
 Read wise, you said.

3:42:37.080 --> 3:42:40.000
 Read wise or something close to that.

3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:43.720
 It could be read something else, like read wealth or something.

3:42:43.720 --> 3:42:49.240
 The one other thing I really like, and this is more of a new one, is I used to always

3:42:49.240 --> 3:42:55.400
 listen to music at the gym, but now I've just, because I'm so backlogged on podcasts, there's

3:42:55.400 --> 3:42:56.400
 so many.

3:42:56.400 --> 3:43:00.480
 I exclusively listen to podcasts when I'm walking or when I'm at the gym.

3:43:00.480 --> 3:43:05.600
 Anytime I'm doing something that I can't read, basically.

3:43:05.600 --> 3:43:11.080
 And I think there's something really special about exercise and ideation.

3:43:11.080 --> 3:43:14.600
 I don't know if this happens to everyone, but my creative juices just go ballistic when

3:43:14.600 --> 3:43:15.600
 I'm at the gym.

3:43:15.600 --> 3:43:20.000
 If I hit a certain point of, I guess, heart rate and you're sweating enough, then the

3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:21.920
 idea is to start to flow.

3:43:21.920 --> 3:43:27.240
 So I'm basically at the gym now listening to podcasts, exercising as fast as I can to

3:43:27.240 --> 3:43:33.560
 try to get to that state of where you're just straining your strenuous exercise, I guess

3:43:33.560 --> 3:43:34.560
 you would say.

3:43:34.560 --> 3:43:38.040
 And then I end up typing notes into my phone as fast as I can with all these ideas that

3:43:38.040 --> 3:43:39.280
 are flowing.

3:43:39.280 --> 3:43:42.160
 So I've created a lot of good writing out of that.

3:43:42.160 --> 3:43:48.240
 Yeah, it's kind of worked, so I do running quite a bit, so running outside.

3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:53.960
 And I'll listen to, I've been, okay, I told myself this has been going on for about a

3:43:53.960 --> 3:43:55.200
 year.

3:43:55.200 --> 3:44:01.940
 Is I only listen to stuff that's either World War II or World War I related.

3:44:01.940 --> 3:44:10.280
 So Hitler, Stalin, like difficult historical stuff.

3:44:10.280 --> 3:44:13.260
 And also listen to brown noise.

3:44:13.260 --> 3:44:14.560
 So those are the two modes.

3:44:14.560 --> 3:44:20.520
 So brown noise helps me, this is like white noise, but like deeper, I guess, it helps

3:44:20.520 --> 3:44:22.840
 me remove the world.

3:44:22.840 --> 3:44:24.960
 At the gym, there's a lot of distractions.

3:44:24.960 --> 3:44:26.600
 When you're running, there's a lot of distractions.

3:44:26.600 --> 3:44:27.760
 It helps me remove the world.

3:44:27.760 --> 3:44:32.520
 So one, I'll be listening to difficult historical ideas.

3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:37.760
 And then when my mind is all of a sudden starting to generate ideas, I'll listen to brown noise

3:44:37.760 --> 3:44:40.320
 and then force myself to think.

3:44:40.320 --> 3:44:44.720
 It's kind of, it's meditative in a sense.

3:44:44.720 --> 3:44:46.560
 And your mind wants to be lazy.

3:44:46.560 --> 3:44:53.640
 You want to, it's hard, man, like running and thinking in the sense that some of the ideas

3:44:53.640 --> 3:44:56.320
 that come into your head are pretty heavy.

3:44:56.320 --> 3:45:01.520
 It's about your own life, it's your own demons come in there, but also just difficult ideas

3:45:01.520 --> 3:45:06.560
 that require you thinking through and persevering through that, like not letting yourself get

3:45:06.560 --> 3:45:11.160
 lazy and like thinking through it has been really for me rewarding in the same way that

3:45:11.160 --> 3:45:14.040
 you're saying it is for you.

3:45:14.040 --> 3:45:21.040
 It's true that like podcasts and music, like shallow, like funny podcasts or music have

3:45:21.040 --> 3:45:28.680
 been a kind of filler distraction, but informational podcasts, like podcasts that have some depths

3:45:28.680 --> 3:45:32.600
 of ideas or audio books have been not truly rewarding.

3:45:32.600 --> 3:45:38.920
 I try to listen now less and less to podcasts that are just fun, because I feel like I enjoyed

3:45:38.920 --> 3:45:44.280
 too much and I don't allow my mind to get bored and to think through stuff, to explore

3:45:44.280 --> 3:45:45.280
 ideas.

3:45:45.280 --> 3:45:53.560
 It's so easy to fill the space that usually would be filled with thought and instead fill

3:45:53.560 --> 3:45:58.400
 it with fun podcasts, like there's a bunch of comedy podcasts I really enjoy.

3:45:58.400 --> 3:46:02.160
 So there's value to that, of course, but you have to realize it's entertainment.

3:46:02.160 --> 3:46:07.440
 It's not, you don't get much value except entertainment.

3:46:07.440 --> 3:46:08.440
 Right.

3:46:08.440 --> 3:46:15.640
 And there's utility to the boredom too, I think, to give your mind the space, I guess

3:46:15.640 --> 3:46:19.920
 your subconscious may be the space to chew on some of these problems, where you've imbibed

3:46:19.920 --> 3:46:23.840
 so much knowledge, you've highlighted and thought about something, but then you need

3:46:23.840 --> 3:46:28.120
 to stop thinking about it for a while and let it marinate in the subconscious.

3:46:28.120 --> 3:46:32.760
 And then these flashes of insight that people have described, sometimes I get them in the

3:46:32.760 --> 3:46:35.440
 middle of the night, I can just wake up from a dream and have them and I got to write it

3:46:35.440 --> 3:46:38.880
 down or sometimes it's in nature, taking a walk.

3:46:38.880 --> 3:46:40.480
 But I think that's very important too.

3:46:40.480 --> 3:46:46.840
 We can't just brute force our way into understanding, there's this interplay between the brute force

3:46:46.840 --> 3:46:54.480
 reading intake and then just relaxing, meditating, sleeping, being bored, letting your subconscious

3:46:54.480 --> 3:46:56.200
 do the heavy lifting.

3:46:56.200 --> 3:47:00.880
 And there's, you should be aware of the fact that there's a war for your attention going

3:47:00.880 --> 3:47:01.880
 on.

3:47:01.880 --> 3:47:06.440
 So there's a lot of, there's been better and better and better mechanisms that are designed

3:47:06.440 --> 3:47:08.680
 to steal your attention.

3:47:08.680 --> 3:47:16.440
 So I kind of see it as a war zone between my right for boredom and the internet wanting

3:47:16.440 --> 3:47:17.440
 your attention.

3:47:17.440 --> 3:47:25.440
 In fact, clubhouse as an app has been, I'm probably not going to use clubhouse much anymore.

3:47:25.440 --> 3:47:31.000
 There's some aspect of my own inner loneliness and whatever it is that pulled me into clubhouse

3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:36.800
 a little bit too much to where, where it robbed me from that lonely time alone where I sit

3:47:36.800 --> 3:47:39.080
 and listen to Bruce Springsteen and think about life.

3:47:39.080 --> 3:47:40.080
 Right?

3:47:40.080 --> 3:47:41.080
 So I want to.

3:47:41.080 --> 3:47:42.080
 That's way more important.

3:47:42.080 --> 3:47:46.760
 That's way, well, yeah, at least, you know, it's all in balance because there is a clubhouse

3:47:46.760 --> 3:47:50.800
 like a lot of these social networks when you use right can be a way to discover new ideas

3:47:50.800 --> 3:47:57.440
 and new people, but the boredom and just being alone with your thoughts is priceless.

3:47:57.440 --> 3:47:58.440
 Absolutely.

3:47:58.440 --> 3:47:59.600
 And you got to know yourself, right?

3:47:59.600 --> 3:48:02.480
 Like it took me a long time to realize I need solitude.

3:48:02.480 --> 3:48:03.480
 Yeah.

3:48:03.480 --> 3:48:07.480
 Like just how I'm wired, how I'm built, I need like an hour a day solitude.

3:48:07.480 --> 3:48:08.880
 So you got to listen to that part of yourself.

3:48:08.880 --> 3:48:13.040
 You might be compromising something like that where you feel like you always need to be with

3:48:13.040 --> 3:48:17.640
 your girlfriend or whatever it may be, but I would suggest listening to that voice.

3:48:17.640 --> 3:48:18.640
 Yeah.

3:48:18.640 --> 3:48:24.320
 So I tried to remember things that made me feel good over time, like longterm had positive

3:48:24.320 --> 3:48:31.200
 impact and longterm had negative impact and do more of the former unless there's a ladder.

3:48:31.200 --> 3:48:33.240
 We don't often think like that.

3:48:33.240 --> 3:48:39.040
 You know, we talked offline about like carnivore diets, for example, I try to remember that

3:48:39.040 --> 3:48:40.920
 carbs don't make me feel good.

3:48:40.920 --> 3:48:41.920
 Yeah.

3:48:41.920 --> 3:48:42.920
 That's what's hard.

3:48:42.920 --> 3:48:45.200
 In the moment, it's hard to remember that.

3:48:45.200 --> 3:48:52.360
 You have to remember that that's the case and in the same way, exercise, it's hard to

3:48:52.360 --> 3:48:56.320
 remember that exercise makes me feel good.

3:48:56.320 --> 3:48:59.080
 Like especially when it's time to go to the gym, especially when it's time to go to the

3:48:59.080 --> 3:49:03.840
 gym, but you should remember that because the kind of person you are without exercise

3:49:03.840 --> 3:49:07.480
 for me, just like he's beautifully said, that you have to know yourself.

3:49:07.480 --> 3:49:14.760
 The kind of person I am without exercise is a less good person, a person I'm less proud

3:49:14.760 --> 3:49:15.760
 of.

3:49:15.760 --> 3:49:16.760
 Yeah.

3:49:16.760 --> 3:49:17.760
 The food thing is so hard.

3:49:17.760 --> 3:49:21.920
 By the way, I still, you know, I can't tell you how many times I've learned the lesson,

3:49:21.920 --> 3:49:23.680
 like don't eat that.

3:49:23.680 --> 3:49:27.680
 But then, you know, you go a few weeks of not eating whatever that is and you're feeling

3:49:27.680 --> 3:49:31.600
 good and then you're, I don't know, something creeps up inside you like, ah, you can just

3:49:31.600 --> 3:49:33.240
 have one or you just do this.

3:49:33.240 --> 3:49:34.240
 But for me, it's sugar.

3:49:34.240 --> 3:49:37.000
 Like sugar just makes me feel terrible.

3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:41.040
 But always, not always, but if it's been a long time, I start to make that exception

3:49:41.040 --> 3:49:44.280
 in my mind, like, oh, you can have a little bit and then I eat it and I feel terrible.

3:49:44.280 --> 3:49:47.480
 I don't know how many times I've done that dance, but it's not cool.

3:49:47.480 --> 3:49:51.120
 What depends on how painful it is and then you learn the lesson, I haven't, I actually

3:49:51.120 --> 3:49:54.800
 embraced the fact that I'll never learn the lesson with vodka.

3:49:54.800 --> 3:50:00.400
 Every time I drink, especially with Russians, it's like, I quit drinking every time.

3:50:00.400 --> 3:50:05.160
 And then I forget, there's like a slow drop off, it'll be like a two weeks and then.

3:50:05.160 --> 3:50:06.160
 Nasterovia.

3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:07.160
 Nasterovia.

3:50:07.160 --> 3:50:08.680
 Very good.

3:50:08.680 --> 3:50:12.120
 So it never makes me feel good.

3:50:12.120 --> 3:50:20.960
 It never results in anything good, except the beautiful social chaos, which is ultimately

3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:26.640
 somehow, there's value to chaos too, you know, there's value to that, whatever the hell stupid

3:50:26.640 --> 3:50:33.920
 stuff you do when you get trashed, the over the top emotion of love usually or whatever,

3:50:33.920 --> 3:50:36.280
 camaraderie, there's value to that too.

3:50:36.280 --> 3:50:44.040
 Like, as I get older, I realize, because the world, sometimes, especially when you get

3:50:44.040 --> 3:50:49.520
 older and the world wants you to be an adult, in order to maintain the youthful spirit,

3:50:49.520 --> 3:50:54.960
 you have to use all the tools you can, alcohol is one of them, to do all the stupid shit

3:50:54.960 --> 3:50:57.960
 you can, even if you're like getting older.

3:50:57.960 --> 3:51:02.600
 To lower the inhibitions and, again, it's that taste of uncertainty that is the sweetness

3:51:02.600 --> 3:51:07.320
 of life, right, to be able to go out and be a flaner at a party and not really know what

3:51:07.320 --> 3:51:08.320
 you're going to do.

3:51:08.320 --> 3:51:14.280
 And it's, we have this draw to the wild side of life, as much as we try and build up order

3:51:14.280 --> 3:51:18.480
 around ourselves, I think there's always going to be an appetite for that.

3:51:18.480 --> 3:51:23.480
 I've always, most of my life, I've always been a social drinker, but I actually gave

3:51:23.480 --> 3:51:25.440
 up alcohol a year ago.

3:51:25.440 --> 3:51:34.880
 And I would add that to the idea, the repertoire for dealing with bigger ideas, because alcohol

3:51:34.880 --> 3:51:42.200
 is fun, it's a, you know, good times, it can be analgesic, it can give you all these benefits

3:51:42.200 --> 3:51:43.960
 if you use the right amounts.

3:51:43.960 --> 3:51:48.480
 But I got to the point personally, where I was trying to wrestle with these ideas that

3:51:48.480 --> 3:51:53.520
 are just so much bigger than me, and I have this backlog of books that was growing faster

3:51:53.520 --> 3:51:58.840
 than I could read them, that I just reached a point where I decided I wanted to start

3:51:58.840 --> 3:52:01.600
 making sacrifices toward attaining that.

3:52:01.600 --> 3:52:07.320
 And alcohol was just an easy one, you know, it's you spend, even if you just drink socially

3:52:07.320 --> 3:52:13.320
 on the weekends, you're probably spending five to 10 hours drinking and then maybe another,

3:52:13.320 --> 3:52:19.240
 what, five to 10 hours recovering, perhaps on the day after.

3:52:19.240 --> 3:52:25.800
 So it was a difficult transition initially, but once you get through a couple of months,

3:52:25.800 --> 3:52:27.120
 I feel amazing without it.

3:52:27.120 --> 3:52:28.780
 I sleep better than ever.

3:52:28.780 --> 3:52:30.600
 My workouts are better than ever.

3:52:30.600 --> 3:52:33.240
 I'm sharper than ever, I'm more lucid.

3:52:33.240 --> 3:52:36.480
 So I'm not trying to be a proponent for like not drinking, but I just want to say.

3:52:36.480 --> 3:52:38.160
 But you're a proponent for sacrifice.

3:52:38.160 --> 3:52:40.960
 I am a big proponent for sacrifice.

3:52:40.960 --> 3:52:45.560
 Is there advice you would give to a young person today, curious about Bitcoin, curious

3:52:45.560 --> 3:52:54.760
 about how they succeed in the world, or both career wise and just in life in general?

3:52:54.760 --> 3:53:01.160
 I mean, the strongest piece of advice I have for, this is beyond just Bitcoin.

3:53:01.160 --> 3:53:08.280
 This is you managing your own personal and financial affairs is that you need to invest

3:53:08.280 --> 3:53:11.800
 in knowledge first.

3:53:11.800 --> 3:53:19.040
 It's not good enough to just follow the crowd and buy a 60, 40 portfolio and put it in a

3:53:19.040 --> 3:53:21.960
 Roth IRA and plan on social security.

3:53:21.960 --> 3:53:29.400
 I mean, the world's changing much faster than any existing institution is going to be able

3:53:29.400 --> 3:53:31.280
 to keep up with.

3:53:31.280 --> 3:53:35.640
 So that's why I like, I mean, that's why I named the show, the question, what is money?

3:53:35.640 --> 3:53:40.820
 Like, I think that to me is the rabbit that took me down the rabbit hole is like just asking

3:53:40.820 --> 3:53:46.280
 that question naturally progressed to these other questions, like what is value, what

3:53:46.280 --> 3:53:52.520
 is government, what is the purpose of society, speech, all of these things.

3:53:52.520 --> 3:53:59.120
 So I would encourage people to arm yourself with knowledge and study.

3:53:59.120 --> 3:54:04.880
 A lot of financial people always give you a line of advice and then say, this is not

3:54:04.880 --> 3:54:05.880
 financial advice.

3:54:05.880 --> 3:54:12.480
 Well, like this is financial advice, like study, study, learn.

3:54:12.480 --> 3:54:13.480
 Knowledge is power.

3:54:13.480 --> 3:54:14.480
 Yeah.

3:54:14.480 --> 3:54:15.480
 This is official financial advice.

3:54:15.480 --> 3:54:16.480
 Yes.

3:54:16.480 --> 3:54:24.840
 And you're exercising your divine trait, which is the logos, right, that we are these animals

3:54:24.840 --> 3:54:26.640
 that can tell and believe stories.

3:54:26.640 --> 3:54:32.520
 So it feels like almost a sacred duty to really sharpen that part of ourselves and use it

3:54:32.520 --> 3:54:37.040
 to create the best world possible.

3:54:37.040 --> 3:54:40.560
 And then, you know, the second one was the, I think, health and fitness stuff.

3:54:40.560 --> 3:54:45.960
 I was, maybe everyone does this in their twenties.

3:54:45.960 --> 3:54:51.480
 They just live a little fast and beat themselves up.

3:54:51.480 --> 3:54:58.480
 Not that I wasn't like I was living well and, you know, successful by a lot of measures,

3:54:58.480 --> 3:55:04.400
 but I wish I had maybe gotten my act together a little bit sooner.

3:55:04.400 --> 3:55:11.040
 I just think, health wise, morality wise, yeah, drinking, I think, morality and eating,

3:55:11.040 --> 3:55:15.040
 you know, I just was kind of doing whatever I wanted in some ways.

3:55:15.040 --> 3:55:20.000
 Let's say, is there a value to a trajectory that includes a lot of mistakes?

3:55:20.000 --> 3:55:22.640
 So maybe you're supposed to make the mistakes in your twenties.

3:55:22.640 --> 3:55:23.640
 That's a great point.

3:55:23.640 --> 3:55:27.200
 Maybe the twenties are all about the mistakes, accumulate the most mistakes possible.

3:55:27.200 --> 3:55:28.200
 Yeah.

3:55:28.200 --> 3:55:32.400
 I don't regret any of it.

3:55:32.400 --> 3:55:36.880
 But now that I'm kind of in this place where I feel good and I know the value of a good

3:55:36.880 --> 3:55:43.680
 night's sleep and just, I've more deeply explored my own potential that I feel maybe a little

3:55:43.680 --> 3:55:46.280
 regretful that I didn't do this earlier is all I'm saying.

3:55:46.280 --> 3:55:50.720
 So maybe just exploring different sides of yourself, right?

3:55:50.720 --> 3:55:54.000
 See what it's like to go and make a bunch of mistakes and be wild and crazy.

3:55:54.000 --> 3:55:57.000
 And then maybe try to walk the straight and narrow for a few months and just see what

3:55:57.000 --> 3:55:59.120
 it's like.

3:55:59.120 --> 3:56:03.360
 There's probably a guy doing vodka shots right now listening to this podcast with his

3:56:03.360 --> 3:56:09.760
 buddies and they, if you are pleased to take a shot for us, for all the mistakes and you

3:56:09.760 --> 3:56:12.680
 should make in your twenties.

3:56:12.680 --> 3:56:18.040
 And what about love?

3:56:18.040 --> 3:56:27.920
 We talked about money is ultimately a mechanism by which you can pave a moral path through

3:56:27.920 --> 3:56:29.320
 life.

3:56:29.320 --> 3:56:34.640
 You know, to me, one of the purest expressions that is love broadly defined for a family,

3:56:34.640 --> 3:56:40.760
 for others, for knowledge for the world is basically an optimistic open view to the world

3:56:40.760 --> 3:56:44.920
 that embraces all that is beautiful about this world.

3:56:44.920 --> 3:56:53.080
 So do you think about love often in a personal sense, romantic family, friendship, and in

3:56:53.080 --> 3:56:58.760
 the broad sense about its value in a successful life?

3:56:58.760 --> 3:57:04.920
 Yeah, of course, I'm blessed to have a two and a half year old daughter.

3:57:04.920 --> 3:57:10.240
 And love is a word we throw around, you know, it's like, I love these potato chips.

3:57:10.240 --> 3:57:11.240
 I love you, man.

3:57:11.240 --> 3:57:12.800
 I love you, my daughter.

3:57:12.800 --> 3:57:20.200
 It's got so many different intensities, I guess you might say, but I don't know.

3:57:20.200 --> 3:57:26.440
 My intuition is that it is something very fundamental to the universe.

3:57:26.440 --> 3:57:34.360
 Again, I know words don't do it justice, but if we just proxy love with selfless action,

3:57:34.360 --> 3:57:38.400
 the whole damn universe is selflessly acting, right?

3:57:38.400 --> 3:57:40.040
 It's just unfolding.

3:57:40.040 --> 3:57:46.280
 And it may sound a bit hippie, dippy, but my intuition is just that love is the core

3:57:46.280 --> 3:57:48.840
 of it somehow.

3:57:48.840 --> 3:57:52.000
 I don't have anything to back that up really, it's just...

3:57:52.000 --> 3:57:58.560
 In the way you're framing it, it's making me think that love, we're talked about sort

3:57:58.560 --> 3:58:06.560
 of meditation, is as opposed to thinking from an egocentric perspective of you, the individual

3:58:06.560 --> 3:58:12.520
 operating in this world is allowing you to be empathetic towards the world, and thereby

3:58:12.520 --> 3:58:17.760
 think of the universe, think of the world acting through you, almost like accepting

3:58:17.760 --> 3:58:24.640
 this notion that ideas have you, you don't have ideas, that you're not existing in the

3:58:24.640 --> 3:58:27.360
 universe, the universe is existing through you.

3:58:27.360 --> 3:58:33.640
 It's sort of like, that's what selfless in that context means, is like embracing that

3:58:33.640 --> 3:58:38.440
 thought, that's a weird thought, that's a weird thought that we're just here for a little

3:58:38.440 --> 3:58:51.680
 bit of time, these meat vehicles, receptacles, and this much bigger thing is just using us,

3:58:51.680 --> 3:58:58.200
 not in a malevolent way, but just like a river flows, is using us to create more and more

3:58:58.200 --> 3:58:59.200
 beautiful things.

3:58:59.200 --> 3:59:02.040
 Yes, yes, more and more beautiful things.

3:59:02.040 --> 3:59:06.680
 We are the universe experiencing itself, frankly, right?

3:59:06.680 --> 3:59:13.240
 That's a trippy thought, man, that in some sense, the universe created us to experience

3:59:13.240 --> 3:59:14.240
 itself.

3:59:14.240 --> 3:59:20.120
 And we are one of the highest forms of beauty that nature has created, if we just think

3:59:20.120 --> 3:59:27.760
 one of the most complex and adaptive thing, we're a reflection of nature, and another

3:59:27.760 --> 3:59:37.400
 thing that comes to mind here is that Dalio has his quote, which says, truth or more accurately,

3:59:37.400 --> 3:59:42.560
 an accurate depiction of reality is necessary for any good outcome.

3:59:42.560 --> 3:59:51.120
 So when we think that love or value is primary, I think that too reinforces this thesis that

3:59:51.120 --> 3:59:56.760
 acting out of love or acting out of proper moral action, you're best reflecting the fundamental

3:59:56.760 --> 4:00:01.520
 nature of reality, therefore you're best creating the best possible outcomes or the things of

4:00:01.520 --> 4:00:05.640
 the most beauty, whether that's your artistic expression, your children, your business,

4:00:05.640 --> 4:00:08.120
 whatever it is.

4:00:08.120 --> 4:00:12.640
 And Jordan Peterson goes deep into that, where you have to listen to that sense of meaning

4:00:12.640 --> 4:00:17.520
 in your life, or you might have some decision on paper that's so great this way, but your

4:00:17.520 --> 4:00:22.040
 heart says no, your heart says otherwise.

4:00:22.040 --> 4:00:28.120
 I've tried to listen to my heart throughout, and I think that creates the best outcomes.

4:00:28.120 --> 4:00:34.840
 But nevertheless, does it make you sad that you in particular, Robert, are going to be

4:00:34.840 --> 4:00:38.560
 dead pretty soon?

4:00:38.560 --> 4:00:45.200
 As we talk about scarcity, one of the certain things that ensure the scarcity of the human

4:00:45.200 --> 4:00:51.680
 experience is the fact that you and your consciousness are going to be done, they have a deadline.

4:00:51.680 --> 4:00:58.960
 Only time and Bitcoin are absolutely scarce.

4:00:58.960 --> 4:01:05.920
 I guess I got started on this philosophical journey a bit when I was younger, but I got

4:01:05.920 --> 4:01:11.360
 into Musashi and Sun Tzu quite a bit.

4:01:11.360 --> 4:01:18.800
 Who wrote Musashi with the Book of Five Rings, Sun Tzu wrote The Art of War, and one of the

4:01:18.800 --> 4:01:22.880
 things that, I mean, these guys were just absolute beasts.

4:01:22.880 --> 4:01:29.080
 They lived and died by the sword, and they were just very great equanimity about all

4:01:29.080 --> 4:01:30.080
 things in life.

4:01:30.080 --> 4:01:37.600
 And I also found this in the Stoic philosophy, where they just are very cool with everything.

4:01:37.600 --> 4:01:41.680
 And one of the lines there is that the way of the warrior is the resolute acceptance

4:01:41.680 --> 4:01:43.680
 of death.

4:01:43.680 --> 4:01:45.200
 So I've always tried to think about that.

4:01:45.200 --> 4:01:51.920
 Of course, I experience fear, I experience everything that you do on a meat suit, like

4:01:51.920 --> 4:01:58.400
 anxiety and all the things, but I always try to have that higher order view of myself and

4:01:58.400 --> 4:02:04.960
 that it's just a certain experience occurring at a certain level, but it shouldn't override

4:02:04.960 --> 4:02:07.120
 your kind of highest order self.

4:02:07.120 --> 4:02:13.680
 That's just resolutely accepted death and that this is your one play in life.

4:02:13.680 --> 4:02:19.480
 So hopefully that propels me towards proper action.

4:02:19.480 --> 4:02:25.280
 I think scarcity cannot help but lead to something good.

4:02:25.280 --> 4:02:29.360
 Just like with this conversation, sadly, it must come to an end.

4:02:29.360 --> 4:02:31.520
 The scarcity of it is what makes it beautiful.

4:02:31.520 --> 4:02:40.320
 So Robert, this was one of my favorite conversations philosophically and in every other level,

4:02:40.320 --> 4:02:48.640
 the ideas and the way you express them around Bitcoin, around morality, around money has

4:02:48.640 --> 4:02:53.600
 been really inspiring and really educational and I'm glad you're out there fighting the

4:02:53.600 --> 4:02:57.040
 good fight and I'm glad you're wasting all of this time with me.

4:02:57.040 --> 4:03:04.360
 It was really fun and thank you for coming down to Texas and having some good old brisket

4:03:04.360 --> 4:03:05.360
 together.

4:03:05.360 --> 4:03:06.680
 This was really fun, man.

4:03:06.680 --> 4:03:07.680
 This was awesome.

4:03:07.680 --> 4:03:10.160
 Thanks for having me, man.

4:03:10.160 --> 4:03:15.200
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Robert Breedlove and thank you to Fundrise,

4:03:15.200 --> 4:03:18.680
 Element, MonkPak, and BetterHelp.

4:03:18.680 --> 4:03:22.080
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

4:03:22.080 --> 4:03:26.000
 And now let me leave you with some words from Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

4:03:26.000 --> 4:03:30.080
 Antifragility is beyond resilience and robustness.

4:03:30.080 --> 4:03:33.760
 The resilient resists shocks and stay the same.

4:03:33.760 --> 4:03:37.600
 The antifragile gets better.

4:03:37.600 --> 4:03:40.200
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
