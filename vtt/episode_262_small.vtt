00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
 How would you as a higher intelligence represent yourself to a lesser intelligence?

00:06.080 --> 00:09.680
 Do you think they saw what they say they saw?

00:09.680 --> 00:12.000
 It didn't just start showing up in 1947.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.960
 How hard do you think it is for aliens to communicate with humans?

00:14.960 --> 00:16.640
 What do we believe in? We believe in technology.

00:16.640 --> 00:20.080
 So you show yourself as a form of technology, right?

00:20.080 --> 00:22.800
 But the common thread is you're not alone.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.280
 And there's something else here with you.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.320
 And there's something that's, as you said, watching you.

00:31.920 --> 00:36.400
 You are a professor at Stanford studying the biology of the human organism at the

00:36.400 --> 00:43.600
 level of individual cells. So let me ask first the big ridiculous philosophical question.

00:43.600 --> 00:49.440
 What is the most beautiful or fascinating aspect of human biology at the level of the cell to you?

00:49.440 --> 00:55.520
 The micro machines and the nanomachines that proteins make and become that to me is the most

00:55.520 --> 01:03.120
 interesting. The fact that you have this basically dynamic computer within every cell that's

01:03.120 --> 01:10.400
 constantly processing its environment. And at the heart of it is DNA, which is a dynamic machine,

01:10.400 --> 01:15.840
 a dynamic computation process. People think of the DNA as a linear code.

01:15.840 --> 01:22.080
 It's codes within codes, within codes. And it is actually the epigenetic state that's doing this

01:22.080 --> 01:27.360
 amazing processing. I mean, if you ever wanted to believe in God, just look inside the cell.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.560
 So DNA is both information and computer. Exactly.

01:30.560 --> 01:36.560
 How did that computer come about? A big continue on the philosophical question.

01:36.560 --> 01:41.040
 Is this both scientific and philosophical? How did life originate on Earth, do you think?

01:41.040 --> 01:49.440
 How did this at every level, so the very first step and the fascinating complex computer that is

01:50.160 --> 01:56.320
 DNA, that is multicellular organism, and then maybe the fascinating complex computer that is

01:56.320 --> 02:02.240
 the human mind? Well, I think you have to take just one more step back to the complex computer

02:02.240 --> 02:08.960
 that is the universe, right? All of the so called particles or the waves that people think the

02:08.960 --> 02:15.920
 universe is made of and appears to me at least to be a computational process and embedded in that

02:15.920 --> 02:24.080
 is biology, right? So all the atoms of a protein, etc., sit in that computational matrix. From my

02:24.080 --> 02:29.360
 point of view, it's computing something. It's computing towards something. It was created

02:29.360 --> 02:33.360
 in some ways if you want to believe in God. And I don't know that I do, but if you want to believe

02:33.360 --> 02:41.280
 in something, the universe was created or at least enabled to allow for life to form. And so

02:42.000 --> 02:47.040
 the DNA, if you ask where does DNA come from, and you can go all the way back to Richard Dawkins

02:47.040 --> 02:56.080
 and the selfish gene hypotheses, the way I look at DNA though is it is not a moment in time.

02:56.080 --> 03:00.880
 It assumes the context of the body and the environment in which it's going to live. And so

03:00.880 --> 03:08.400
 if you want to ask a question of where and how does information get stored, DNA, although it's

03:08.400 --> 03:16.080
 only 3 billion base pairs long, contains more information than I think the entire computational

03:16.960 --> 03:23.520
 memory resources of our current technology. Because who and what you are is both what you

03:23.520 --> 03:29.200
 were as an egg all the way through to the day you die and it embodies all the different cell

03:29.200 --> 03:38.080
 types and organs in your body. And so it's a computational reservoir of information and expectation

03:38.640 --> 03:44.400
 that you will become. So actually, I would sort of turn it around a different way and say if you

03:44.400 --> 03:52.800
 wanted to create the best memory storage system possible, you could reverse engineer what a human

03:52.800 --> 04:02.000
 is and create a DNA memory system that is not just the linear version, but is also everything

04:02.000 --> 04:05.760
 that it could become. When we're talking about DNA, we're talking about Earth and the environment

04:05.760 --> 04:11.600
 creating DNA. So you're talking about trying to come up with an optimal computer for this

04:11.600 --> 04:20.400
 particular environment. Right. So if you reverse engineer that computer, what do you mean by

04:20.400 --> 04:26.400
 considering all the possible things it could become? So who you are today, right? So 3 billion

04:26.400 --> 04:34.320
 bits of information does not explain Lex Friedman, doesn't explain me, right? But the DNA embodies

04:34.320 --> 04:41.920
 the expectation of the environment in which you will live and grow and become. So all the

04:41.920 --> 04:49.040
 information that is you, right, is actually not only embedded in the DNA, but it's embedded

04:49.040 --> 04:57.120
 in the context of the world in which you grow into and develop, right? So all that information,

04:57.120 --> 05:03.520
 though, is packed in the expectation of what the DNA expects to see. Interesting. So some of the

05:03.520 --> 05:10.320
 information, is that accurate to say, is stored outside the body? Exactly. Yeah. The information

05:10.320 --> 05:14.720
 is stored outside because there's a context of expectation. Isn't that interesting? Yeah,

05:14.720 --> 05:23.120
 it's fascinating. I mean, to linger on this point, if we were to run Earth over again a million

05:23.120 --> 05:28.640
 times, how many different versions of this type of computer would we get? I think it would be

05:28.640 --> 05:33.520
 different each time. I mean, if you assume there's no such thing as fate, right, and it's not all

05:33.520 --> 05:39.040
 pre programmed, you know, and that there is some sort of, let's say, variation or randomness at

05:39.040 --> 05:45.440
 the beginning, you would get as many different versions of life as you could imagine. And I

05:45.440 --> 05:49.920
 don't think it would all be unless there's something built into the, you know, into the

05:49.920 --> 05:56.880
 substrate of the universe. It wouldn't always be left handed proteins, right? But I wonder what

05:56.880 --> 06:05.120
 the flap of a butterfly wing, what effects it has, because it's possible that this system is really

06:05.120 --> 06:12.880
 good at finding the efficient answer. And maybe the efficient answer is there's only a small finite

06:12.880 --> 06:17.120
 set of them for this particular environment. Exactly. Exactly. That's the kind of, in a way,

06:17.120 --> 06:22.640
 the anthropomorphic universe of the multiverse expectations, right? That, you know, there's

06:22.640 --> 06:27.760
 probably a zillion other kinds of universes out there, if you believe in multiverse theory.

06:27.760 --> 06:34.960
 We only live in the ones where the rules are such that life like ours can exist.

06:35.760 --> 06:40.800
 So using that logic, how many alien civilizations do you think are out there? There's, there's,

06:41.920 --> 06:50.240
 there's like trillions of environments, aka planets, or maybe you can think even bigger

06:50.240 --> 06:58.080
 than planets. How many life like organisms do you think are out there thriving? And maybe how

06:58.080 --> 07:05.520
 many do you think are long gone, but we're once here? I think, well, innumerable. I think in terms

07:05.520 --> 07:10.480
 of the greater than zero, much greater than zero. I mean, I would just be surprised what a waste,

07:10.480 --> 07:16.720
 right, of all that space just for us, if we're never going to get there. That would be my first

07:16.720 --> 07:26.720
 way to think about it. But second, I mean, I remember when I was about seven or eight years old,

07:26.720 --> 07:32.320
 and I would love if any of your listeners could find this National Geographic. I remember opening

07:33.760 --> 07:39.200
 the page of the National Geographic. I was about, again, seven to 10 years old. And it was sort of

07:39.200 --> 07:46.240
 a current picture of the universe. It was around probably 1968, 1969. I just remember looking at

07:46.240 --> 07:56.960
 it and thinking, what kinds of empires have risen and fallen across that space that we'll never

07:56.960 --> 08:05.760
 know about? And isn't that sad that we know nothing about something so grand? And so,

08:05.760 --> 08:13.040
 I've always been a reader of science fiction, because I like the creative ideas of what people

08:13.040 --> 08:19.280
 come up with. And I especially like science fiction writers that base it in good science,

08:19.280 --> 08:27.840
 but base it also in evolution. That if you evolve a civilization from something life like, right,

08:27.840 --> 08:36.240
 some sort of biology, its assumptions about the universe will come from the environment in which

08:36.240 --> 08:42.400
 it grew up. So for instance, Larry Niven is a great writer. And he imagines different kinds of

08:43.120 --> 08:49.600
 civilizations. In some cases, what happens if, what happens if intelligence evolved from a herd

08:49.600 --> 08:57.120
 animal, right? Would you lead from behind? Right? Would you be, you know, in his case,

08:57.120 --> 09:03.040
 one of them were the so called puppeteers. And to them, the moral imperative is cowardice.

09:03.040 --> 09:09.360
 You put other people forward to run the risk for you, right? And so he writes entire books around

09:09.360 --> 09:16.800
 that premise. There's another guy, Bryn, David Bryn, is his name, and he writes the so called

09:16.800 --> 09:25.760
 uplift universe books. And in those, he takes different intelligences, each from a different

09:25.760 --> 09:33.360
 evolutionary background. And then he posits a civilization based around where and what they

09:33.360 --> 09:39.040
 came from. And so to me, I mean, that's, that's just fun. But I mean, back to your original

09:39.040 --> 09:46.960
 question is how many are there, I think is as, as, as many stars as we can see. Now, how many

09:46.960 --> 09:52.640
 are currently there? I don't know. I mean, that's the whole, that's the whole question of, you know,

09:52.640 --> 10:00.560
 how long can a civilization last before it runs out of steam? In you, for instance, does it just

10:00.560 --> 10:05.040
 get bored? Or does it transcend to something else? Or does it say, I've seen enough and I'm done?

10:05.040 --> 10:09.360
 What does running out of steam look like? It could be destroy itself or get bored?

10:09.360 --> 10:16.720
 You know, or we've done everything we can, and they just decide to stop. I don't know. I just

10:16.720 --> 10:22.880
 don't know. It's that you almost worry that we stop reproducing, or we slow down the reproduction

10:22.880 --> 10:27.760
 rate to where the population can go to zero. Can go to zero and we can't and we collapse. I mean,

10:27.760 --> 10:36.080
 so the only way to get around that is perhaps create enough machines with AI to take care of us.

10:36.080 --> 10:45.920
 What could possibly go wrong? You've talked to people that told stories of UFO encounters.

10:46.960 --> 10:51.520
 What is the most fascinating to you about the stories of these UFO encounters that

10:52.560 --> 11:00.320
 you've heard that people have told you? The similarity of them, the uniformity of the stories.

11:00.320 --> 11:07.680
 Now, I just want to say up front, a lot of people think that when I speculate,

11:08.400 --> 11:14.560
 I believe something. That's not true, right? Speculation is just creativity. Speculation

11:14.560 --> 11:22.080
 is the beginning of hypothesis. None of what I hear in terms of the anecdotes do I necessarily

11:22.080 --> 11:27.440
 believe are they true? But I still find them fascinating to listen to because at some level,

11:27.440 --> 11:34.720
 there's still raw data. And you have to listen. And once you start to hear the same story again

11:34.720 --> 11:38.960
 and again, then you have to say, well, there might be something to it. I mean, maybe it's

11:38.960 --> 11:45.440
 some kind of a Jungian background in the human mind and human consciousness that creates these

11:45.440 --> 11:50.720
 stories again and again. It's coming out of the DNA. It's coming out of that pre programmed

11:50.720 --> 11:55.280
 something. And Jung talked quite a bit about this kind of thing, the collective unconscious.

11:55.280 --> 12:02.080
 But actually, one of the most interesting ones I find is this constant message

12:03.120 --> 12:11.760
 that you're not taking care of your world. And this came long before climate change. It came

12:11.760 --> 12:22.400
 long before many kinds of, let's say, current day memes around taking care of our planet,

12:22.400 --> 12:28.400
 pollution, etc. And so, you know, for instance, perhaps the best example of this, the one that

12:28.400 --> 12:36.720
 I find the most fascinating is a story out of Zimbabwe 50 or 60 children, one afternoon

12:37.680 --> 12:46.560
 in Zimbabwe. It's a, it was a well educated group of white and black children who end lunchtime

12:46.560 --> 12:54.400
 in the playground, saw a craft, and they saw little men. And they all ran into the teachers

12:54.400 --> 12:59.920
 and they told the same story and they drew the same pictures. And the message several of them got was,

13:01.200 --> 13:06.800
 you are not taking care of your planet. And it got, you know, there's actually a movie coming

13:06.800 --> 13:13.920
 out on this episode. And 30 years later, now, the people who are there, the children who've

13:13.920 --> 13:21.360
 now grown up say it, it happened to us. Now, did it happen? Was it some sort of hallucination?

13:21.360 --> 13:27.120
 Or was it an imposed hallucination by something? Was it material? I don't know. But

13:28.400 --> 13:34.960
 these kids were seven to 10 years old. You see them on video, seven to 10 year olds can't lie

13:34.960 --> 13:41.760
 like that. And so, you know, whether it's real or not, I don't know. But I find that fascinating

13:41.760 --> 13:49.680
 data. And again, it's that it's these unconnected stories of individuals with the same with the

13:49.680 --> 14:00.320
 same story. That is worthy of further inquiry. Yeah, so here we are humans with limited cognitive

14:00.320 --> 14:04.160
 capacities trying to make sense of the world, trying to understand what is real and not.

14:04.720 --> 14:09.920
 We have this DNA that somehow in complex ways is interacting with the environment.

14:09.920 --> 14:22.720
 And then we get these novel ideas that come from the populace. And then they make us wonder about

14:22.720 --> 14:29.600
 what it all means. And so how to interpret it. If you think from an alien perspective,

14:29.600 --> 14:36.880
 how would you communicate with other lifelike organisms? You perhaps have to find

14:36.880 --> 14:45.600
 endpoints on this interaction between the DNA and its manifestations in terms of the human mind

14:45.600 --> 14:51.760
 and the how it interacts with the environment. So get some kind of, all right, what is this DNA?

14:51.760 --> 14:57.840
 What is this environment? I have to get in somehow to like interact with it to get to perturb the

14:57.840 --> 15:04.800
 system to where these little ants, human like ants get like excited and figure and see stuff out.

15:04.800 --> 15:11.520
 Yeah, yeah. And then somehow steer them. First of all, for investigative purposes,

15:11.520 --> 15:15.600
 understand like oftentimes to understand the system, you have to perturb it.

15:15.600 --> 15:22.400
 Exactly. It's like poke at it to get excited or not. And then the other ways you want to,

15:23.600 --> 15:29.760
 if you worry about them, you can steer in one direction or another. And this kind of idea that

15:29.760 --> 15:36.080
 we're not taking care of our world. That's interesting. I mean, that's comforting. That's

15:36.080 --> 15:40.880
 hopeful because that means the greater intelligence, which is what I would hope,

15:40.880 --> 15:46.400
 we want to take care of us. Like we want to take care of the gorillas in the national parks in

15:46.400 --> 15:51.840
 Africa. Yeah. But we don't want to take care of cockroaches. So there's a line we draw. So you

15:51.840 --> 15:57.360
 have to hope that. Right now, we're a bunch of angry monkeys. And, you know, maybe whatever

15:57.360 --> 16:03.200
 these intelligences are, are also keeping an eye on us. You know, that you don't want a bunch of,

16:03.200 --> 16:07.840
 you know, you don't want the angry monkey troop stomping around the local galactic arm.

16:08.640 --> 16:14.800
 Do you think these folks are telling the truth? Do you think they saw what they say they saw?

16:15.520 --> 16:21.280
 I think they saw what they said they saw. But I also think they saw what they were shown.

16:21.280 --> 16:27.920
 I mean, if you go back to the whole notion of, okay, how long has this been around? It didn't

16:27.920 --> 16:36.160
 just start showing up in 1947. There are stories going back, you know, into the 1800s of people

16:36.160 --> 16:43.120
 who saw things in their farming, in their farm fields in the US. It's in local newspapers

16:43.120 --> 16:49.280
 from the 1800s. It's fascinating. But if you can go even further back, you know, so to your point

16:49.280 --> 16:55.120
 to your point of how are, how would you as a higher intelligence represent yourself

16:55.920 --> 17:02.960
 to a lesser intelligence? Well, let's go back to pre civilization. Maybe you show yourself

17:02.960 --> 17:09.040
 as the spirits in the forest. And you give messages through that. Once you get a little

17:09.040 --> 17:14.160
 bit more civilized, civilized, then you show yourself as the gods. And then your God, well,

17:14.160 --> 17:18.240
 we don't believe in God anymore, necessarily, not everybody does. So what do we believe in?

17:18.240 --> 17:23.360
 We believe in technology. So you show yourself as a form of technology, right? But the common

17:23.360 --> 17:29.680
 thread is, you're not alone. And there's something else here with you. And there's something that's,

17:29.680 --> 17:37.360
 as you said, watching you, and at least watching over your shoulder. But I think that like any

17:37.360 --> 17:45.680
 good parent, you don't tell your student everything, you make them learn. And learning requires

17:45.680 --> 17:49.840
 mistakes. Because if you tell them everything, then they get lazy.

17:51.360 --> 17:58.160
 You've looked at the brains of, or information coming from the brain of some of the people

17:58.160 --> 18:02.400
 that have had your phone counters. What's common about the brain of people who encounter your

18:02.400 --> 18:10.000
 phones? So the study started with a group of, let's say, a cohort of individuals that were

18:10.000 --> 18:19.040
 brought to me and their MRIs to ask about the damage that had been seen in these individuals.

18:19.040 --> 18:22.720
 It turns out that the majority of those patients ended up being, as far as we can tell,

18:22.720 --> 18:30.080
 Havana syndrome. And so for me, at least, that part of the story ends in terms of the injury.

18:30.080 --> 18:36.240
 It's likely almost all Havana syndrome. That's somebody else's problem now. That's not my problem.

18:36.240 --> 18:43.280
 But when we were looking at the brains of these individuals, we noticed something right in the

18:43.280 --> 18:49.120
 center of the basal ganglia in many of these individuals that at first we thought was damage.

18:49.120 --> 18:56.800
 It was basically an enriched patch of MRI dense neurons that we thought was damage.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.800
 But then it was showing up in everybody and then we looked and said, oh, it's actually not.

19:00.800 --> 19:07.040
 The other readings on these MRIs show that actually that's living tissue. That's actually

19:07.040 --> 19:11.920
 the head of the caudate and the pitamen. And at the time, and I remember even asking a good friend

19:11.920 --> 19:18.000
 of mine at Stanford who was a psychiatrist, what does the basal ganglia do? He said, oh,

19:18.000 --> 19:24.080
 the basal ganglia is just about movement and nerve and motor control. And I said, well,

19:24.080 --> 19:29.440
 that's odd because there's other papers that we were reading at the time started to suggest

19:29.440 --> 19:37.040
 that it was involved with higher intelligence and is actually downstream of the executive function

19:38.160 --> 19:45.280
 and involved with intuition and planning. And then if you think about it, if you're

19:45.280 --> 19:50.640
 going to have motor control, which is centralized in one place, motor control requires knowledge

19:50.640 --> 19:56.000
 of the environment. You don't want to move something and hit the table. Or if you're

19:56.000 --> 20:02.960
 walking across a room, you want to be aware and cognizant of what you might bump into.

20:03.520 --> 20:13.520
 So obviously, all of that planning is requires access to all the senses. It requires access

20:13.520 --> 20:19.840
 to your desires and memory, knowledge of where and what you want and desire to walk nearby. Like,

20:19.840 --> 20:23.680
 I use the example of you're at a party, you want to avoid that person, you like that person,

20:23.680 --> 20:30.640
 the waiter is about to drop something, all without thinking, you maneuver. So that actually,

20:30.640 --> 20:36.000
 all that planning is done in the basal ganglia. And it's actually now called the brain within

20:36.000 --> 20:43.280
 the brain. It's a, it's a goal processing system, subservient to executive function.

20:44.240 --> 20:51.280
 So what we think we found there was not something which allows people to talk to UFOs. I mean,

20:51.280 --> 20:58.960
 I think the UFO community took it a step too far. What I think we found was a form of

20:59.520 --> 21:05.760
 higher functioning and processing. So what we then looked at, and this was the most fascinating part

21:05.760 --> 21:13.520
 of it, we, we looked then at individuals in the families of those, let's say the index case

21:13.520 --> 21:19.680
 individuals, and we found that it was actually in families. And more so, this is the most

21:19.680 --> 21:25.920
 fascinating part. We've probably looked now at about 200 just random cases that you can download

21:25.920 --> 21:33.440
 off of databases online. You don't see this higher connectivity. You only find it in what

21:33.440 --> 21:39.120
 Kate Green would have called or has called higher functioning individuals, people who are,

21:41.600 --> 21:47.680
 I mean, he, he called them savants. I don't have the means to, we haven't done the testing.

21:47.680 --> 21:54.640
 But as it turns out, my family has it, right? We, we found it in, in me, my brother, my sister,

21:54.640 --> 22:01.440
 my mother, we found it as well in other individuals, husband and wife pairs. So statistically,

22:02.240 --> 22:06.800
 if you had a group of 20 individuals and you found two husband, wife pairs, both of whom had it,

22:06.800 --> 22:12.160
 and yet it's only found it about, we think one and 200, one and 300 individuals. The fact that two

22:12.160 --> 22:19.440
 individuals came together, two sets of individuals came together, both of whom had it implied either

22:19.440 --> 22:30.880
 a restricted breeding group or attraction. The reason why it seems to be in let's say so called

22:31.600 --> 22:38.000
 experiencers or people who claim if, if intuition is the ability to see something that other people

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
 don't, I don't mean that in a paranormal sense, but being able to see something just in front of

22:44.000 --> 22:49.760
 you that other people might just dismiss. Well, maybe that's a function of a higher kind of

22:49.760 --> 22:58.080
 intelligence to say, well, I, I'm not looking at an artifact. I'm not looking at something that I

22:58.080 --> 23:03.440
 should just ignore. I'm seeing something and I recognize it for not what it is, but that it is

23:03.440 --> 23:09.040
 something different than it is normally found in my environment. Yeah. You know, I have a little

23:09.040 --> 23:16.960
 bit of that. I seem to see the magic in a lot of moments. Like I have a deep, it's obviously,

23:16.960 --> 23:25.360
 not obviously, but it seems to be chemical in nature that I just am excited about life. I love

23:25.920 --> 23:31.280
 life. I love like stupid things. It feels like I'm high a lot on like mushrooms or something

23:31.280 --> 23:35.920
 like that where you'd really appreciate that. So you're able, I'm able to detect something

23:36.560 --> 23:43.760
 about the environment that maybe others don't, I don't know, but like I seem to be over the top

23:44.640 --> 23:50.240
 grateful to be alive on a lot of first, a lot of stupid reasons. And that's in there somewhere.

23:50.240 --> 23:58.000
 I mean, it's kind of interesting because it really is true that our brains, the way we're

23:58.000 --> 24:03.840
 brought up, but also the genetics enables us to see certain slices of the world. And

24:06.320 --> 24:14.800
 some people are probably more receptive to anomalous information. They see the magic,

24:14.800 --> 24:22.960
 the possibility in the novel thing as opposed to kind of finding the pattern of the common

24:22.960 --> 24:27.920
 of the regular. Some people are more, wait a minute, this is kind of weird. I mean, a lot of those

24:27.920 --> 24:34.400
 people who probably become scientists too, like, huh, like there was this pattern happening over

24:34.400 --> 24:40.880
 and over and over and then something weird just happened. And then you get excited by that weirdness

24:40.880 --> 24:46.480
 and start to pull the string and discover what is at the core of that weirdness. And perhaps,

24:46.480 --> 24:56.080
 is that, maybe by way of question, how does the human perception system deal with anomalous

24:56.080 --> 25:01.200
 information, do you think? Well, it first tries to classify it and get it out of the way. If it's

25:01.200 --> 25:09.600
 not food, if it's not sex, right? If it's not in the way of my desires, or if it isn't the way of

25:09.600 --> 25:18.240
 my desires, then you focus on it. And so the, I think the question is how much spare processing

25:18.240 --> 25:27.120
 power, how much CPU cycles do we spend on things that are not those core desires?

25:28.240 --> 25:37.840
 What is the most kind of memorable, powerful UFO encounter report you've ever heard?

25:37.840 --> 25:42.160
 Just to your personal, on a personal level, like there's something that was really powerful.

25:42.160 --> 25:48.240
 Well, I mentioned the Zimbabwe one, that's particularly interesting. And one that actually

25:48.240 --> 25:55.920
 most people don't know about, but family driving down the highway, two little girls in the back,

25:56.960 --> 26:06.480
 open glass topped car, and the little girls see a craft right over their car. This is in

26:06.480 --> 26:14.800
 the middle of the day on a busy highway. The mother sees it. Nobody can, they look around,

26:14.800 --> 26:18.320
 nobody else seems to see it. So the girls take out their camera, take a picture of it.

26:19.760 --> 26:27.440
 And then they get home. They look at the picture. There's no craft, but there's a little object

26:28.160 --> 26:35.280
 about 30 feet above their car or so, probably about three feet across, kind of star shaped.

26:35.280 --> 26:40.560
 It's not the craft, but it's something else. There's obviously, there was something there.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.640
 And so what were they seeing? Were they seeing a projection? Were they seeing,

26:45.200 --> 26:46.720
 and why were only they seeing it?

26:47.920 --> 26:53.440
 And the photograph was capturing something very different than they were seeing,

26:53.440 --> 26:59.600
 but they're still an object. Can you give a little bit of context? Is this from modern day?

26:59.600 --> 27:02.400
 It's modern day. Oh yeah, they had a camera. I mean, they had a cell phone camera.

27:02.400 --> 27:06.320
 And this was like a four or five years ago. Report provided. By the way,

27:06.320 --> 27:08.960
 where's like a central place to provide a report? Is this?

27:08.960 --> 27:12.480
 Oh, there's a move on, but this isn't public. I've seen the picture.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.480
 Oh, this is something you've directly interacted with.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.640
 Yeah. Yeah. I've seen the picture.

27:16.640 --> 27:23.120
 So those moments like that, they captivate your mind.

27:23.120 --> 27:28.000
 It's so different. It doesn't fall into the standard story at all. But it also,

27:28.000 --> 27:34.560
 but in another way, it's kind of a, it's a clear renunciation of this notion that when

27:34.560 --> 27:39.360
 people see events, they don't all see the same thing. Now, we've heard this about like traffic

27:39.360 --> 27:43.840
 accidents. Different people will see the color of the car differently or the chain of events

27:43.840 --> 27:48.640
 differently. And this tells you that memory isn't anywhere near what we think it is.

27:48.640 --> 27:56.000
 But the issue around these so called UFO reports is that the same people will see a very different

27:56.000 --> 28:04.560
 thing almost as if whatever it is is projecting a, is projecting something into the mind rather

28:04.560 --> 28:11.040
 than it being real, right? Rather than it being a real manifestation, you know, material in front

28:11.040 --> 28:17.920
 of you, it's actually almost some sort of an altered virtual reality that is imposed on you.

28:17.920 --> 28:23.920
 I mean, you know, I think the company Metta and all the virtual reality companies would

28:23.920 --> 28:27.840
 love to have something like that, right? Well, you don't have to actually wear something on

28:27.840 --> 28:33.040
 your face to experience a virtual reality. What happens if you could just project it?

28:33.680 --> 28:36.400
 Well, that's the fundamental question from an alien perspective.

28:37.040 --> 28:43.200
 When you look at it, or as we humans look at ants, how does this perception system operate?

28:43.200 --> 28:46.960
 So not only how does this thing's mind operate? How does the human mind operate?

28:47.680 --> 28:51.360
 But how does it, their perception system operate so that we can like

28:51.360 --> 28:59.120
 stimulate the perception system properly to get them to think certain things? And so, you know,

29:00.560 --> 29:07.200
 that's a really important question. Humans think that, you know, the only way to communicate is in

29:07.200 --> 29:14.320
 like 3D or 4D space time, there's physical objects, or maybe you write things into some kind of

29:14.320 --> 29:24.080
 language. But there could be just so much more richness in how you can communicate. And so,

29:24.080 --> 29:27.920
 from an alien perspective, or somebody has much greater technological capabilities,

29:27.920 --> 29:35.440
 you have to figure out how do I use the skills I have to stimulate the human, the limited humans.

29:35.440 --> 29:40.480
 Right. Well, I mean, let's take the ants exam again as an example. Let's say that you wanted to

29:40.480 --> 29:46.000
 make ants practical. You wanted to use them for something, right? You wanted to use them as a

29:46.000 --> 29:53.520
 form of biological robot. Now, DARPA and other people have been trying to use insects for, you

29:53.520 --> 29:59.200
 know, turn them into biological robots. But if you wanted to, you would have to interact with their

30:00.160 --> 30:06.000
 sense of smell, right? Their pheromone system that they use to interact with each other.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
 So you would either create those molecules to talk to them, to make them do, I'm not saying talk to

30:12.000 --> 30:16.880
 them as if they're intelligent, but talk to them to manipulate them in ways that you want. Or if

30:16.880 --> 30:24.400
 you were advanced enough, you would use some sort of electromagnetic or other means to stimulate

30:24.400 --> 30:30.880
 their neurons in ways that would accomplish the same goal as the pheromones, but by doing it in a

30:30.880 --> 30:39.600
 sort of a telefactoring way. So let's say you wanted to telefactor with humans. You would interact

30:39.600 --> 30:45.440
 with them. And this is again, this is a technology which you could imagine possible. You could

30:45.440 --> 30:52.080
 telefactor information into the sensory system of a human, right? But then each human is a little

30:52.080 --> 30:56.880
 bit different. So either you know enough about them to tailor it to that individual, or you just

30:56.880 --> 31:02.240
 basically take advantage of whatever the sensory net is that that individual has. So if you happen

31:02.240 --> 31:08.240
 to be good at sound, or you happen to be a very visually inclined individual, then maybe the

31:08.240 --> 31:14.400
 sensory information that you get that's most effective in terms of transmitting information

31:14.400 --> 31:20.240
 would come through that portal. I think the aliens would need to figure out the human's value

31:20.240 --> 31:27.840
 physical consistency. So we've discovered physics. So we want our perception to make sense. Maybe

31:27.840 --> 31:33.840
 they don't, they haven't, you know, that's not an obvious fact of perception that you have to figure

31:33.840 --> 31:39.760
 out what kind of things are humans used to observing in this particular environment of

31:39.760 --> 31:47.840
 earth? And how do we stimulate the perception system in a way that's not anomalous or not too

31:47.840 --> 31:53.680
 or not too, doesn't cross that threshold of just like, well, that's way too weird. Right. So they

31:53.680 --> 31:59.040
 have to, I mean, that's not obvious that that should be important. You know, maybe you want to

31:59.040 --> 32:06.160
 err on the side of anomaly, like lean into the weirdness. So communication is complicated.

32:06.160 --> 32:11.600
 Yeah. Well, that's why I always, I always find this issue of people talking about the so called

32:11.600 --> 32:18.320
 grays as interesting because it is related to what you're saying. They're different enough.

32:19.280 --> 32:25.440
 But they're not so different as to be scary, right? They're not venom dripping fangs, right?

32:25.440 --> 32:32.160
 They're different enough. But they, they all it's also like they're, they're what you could imagine

32:32.160 --> 32:38.800
 us becoming in some distant future. So is that a purposeful representation? I don't know. I mean,

32:38.800 --> 32:44.000
 I don't believe in the grays, for instance, but I believe that people think that they see it.

32:44.560 --> 32:50.480
 So if we're talking about a communication strategy that says, you know, we're, we're like you, but

32:50.480 --> 32:58.240
 not the same as you, this might be a manifestation that you, that you represent in terms of a

32:58.240 --> 33:06.240
 communication strategy. What do you make of David's favorite sighting of the Tic Tac UFO

33:06.240 --> 33:11.120
 and other pilots who have seen these objects that seem to defy the laws of physics?

33:12.400 --> 33:15.360
 Well, I think you have to take them at their word.

33:16.880 --> 33:21.120
 Are they fascinating to you? Oh, absolutely. No, I know, I know a lot of these people, right? So I,

33:21.680 --> 33:30.160
 I know Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon, the whole crowd I've been, I saw the videos about three weeks or

33:30.160 --> 33:39.120
 so before they went public. I was at a bar with Lou overlooking the Pentagon in Crystal City,

33:39.120 --> 33:43.600
 and they showed him to me and my hair stood on end. And he said, he said, this is, he said,

33:43.600 --> 33:51.280
 this is coming out soon. And I, I know one of the guys on the inside who was the Naval Intelligence

33:51.280 --> 33:56.560
 who had interviewed all of these pilots again before this came out. And it was hair raising

33:56.560 --> 34:04.320
 to hear this. But also exciting that, you know, here's not just people's testimony,

34:04.320 --> 34:10.000
 these are credible individuals. And if you've seen the 60 minute episode with some of the pilots,

34:11.200 --> 34:16.880
 you know, they have no monetary gain, if anything, they've got negative gain from coming out. But

34:16.880 --> 34:24.000
 then you also have all of those simultaneous ship analysis from the USS Princeton and the

34:24.000 --> 34:33.440
 radar analysis, et cetera. So, you know, at the end of the day, it's just data. It's not a conclusion.

34:35.200 --> 34:40.240
 I'd be perfectly happy, honestly, perfectly happy if somebody showed that it was all a hoax.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.920
 Can I go back to my day job? Right?

34:43.920 --> 34:49.520
 That could be a hoax, but other things might not be. I mean, this is the point. I mean,

34:49.520 --> 34:55.600
 this is why it's nice to remove some of the stigma about this topic because it's all just data and

34:58.080 --> 35:04.320
 anomalous events are such that there's going to be, they're going to be rare in terms of how much

35:04.320 --> 35:10.000
 data they represent. But we have to consider the full range of data to discover the things that

35:10.000 --> 35:16.080
 actually represent something that's, if we pull at it, we'll discover something that's extraterrestrial

35:16.080 --> 35:21.840
 or something deep about the phenomena on Earth that we don't yet understand.

35:21.840 --> 35:27.920
 Right. Well, if it only stimulates people, for instance, to think, okay, well, what happens

35:27.920 --> 35:36.800
 if we could move like that with momentumless movement? And it stimulates young individuals to

35:36.800 --> 35:43.120
 go into the sciences to ask those questions. That to me is fascinating. I mean, after I've been

35:43.120 --> 35:49.440
 openly talking about this in the last year especially, I've had a number of students from

35:50.000 --> 35:58.000
 top schools who aren't my students come to me and say, if I can help, let me. How can I help?

35:58.000 --> 36:02.720
 I never had thought about this before, but you opened, you and others, not just you and others,

36:02.720 --> 36:06.080
 have opened my mind to thinking about this matter.

36:06.080 --> 36:11.040
 Yeah, that's why it's actually funny that Elon Musk doesn't think too much about this

36:11.040 --> 36:17.600
 these kinds of propulsion systems that could defy the laws of physics as we currently understand

36:17.600 --> 36:26.240
 them. To me, it's a powerful way to think what is possible. It's inspiring, even if some of the

36:26.240 --> 36:32.800
 data doesn't represent extraterrestrial vehicles, I think the observation itself,

36:32.800 --> 36:39.600
 it's like something you mentioned, which is hypothesizing, imagining these things,

36:39.600 --> 36:47.040
 considering the possibility of these things, I think opens up your mind in a way that ultimately

36:47.040 --> 36:51.760
 can create the technology. First, you have to believe the technology is possible before you

36:51.760 --> 36:59.200
 can create it. Right. In my own lab, we always look for, as I've said before, what is inevitable?

37:00.080 --> 37:05.680
 And saying, inevitably, this is the kind of data we need, but if we need that kind of data,

37:05.680 --> 37:14.080
 the instrument we want doesn't exist. Okay, so I imagine the perfect instrument, I can't make it,

37:14.800 --> 37:21.440
 and you back into something which is practical. And then you, in a sense, reverse engineer the

37:21.440 --> 37:28.400
 future of what it is that you want to make. And I've started and sold like at least half a dozen

37:28.400 --> 37:35.440
 or more companies using that basic premise. And so it was always something that didn't exist

37:35.440 --> 37:41.760
 today, but we imagined what we wanted. And at the time, many people said it couldn't be done.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.280
 I mean, for instance, all the gene therapy that's done today with retroviruses

37:46.160 --> 37:53.040
 came from a group meeting in David Baltimore's lab, I was a postdoc with him. And one of the

37:53.040 --> 37:59.920
 other postdocs wasn't able to make retroviruses in a way that he wanted to. And I realized I had

37:59.920 --> 38:06.720
 a cell line that would allow us to make retroviruses in two days rather than two months. And so he and

38:06.720 --> 38:11.760
 I then worked together to make that system. And now all gene therapy with retroviruses is done

38:11.760 --> 38:16.400
 using this basic approach around the whole world, because something couldn't be done.

38:17.200 --> 38:23.360
 And we wanted to do it better. And we imagined the future. And so that's, I think,

38:23.360 --> 38:29.600
 what the whole UFO phenomenon is doing for people is like, well, let's imagine a future

38:30.880 --> 38:34.720
 where these kinds of technologies are, but also let's imagine a future where we don't blow

38:34.720 --> 38:39.280
 ourselves up, right? So if these things are there, they manage to not blow themselves up.

38:40.400 --> 38:46.400
 So it means that at least one other civilization got past the inflection point.

38:47.120 --> 38:52.000
 So if some of the encounters are actually representing alien civilizations visiting us,

38:52.000 --> 39:00.000
 why do you think they're doing so? You suggested that perhaps it's the study

39:00.000 --> 39:06.800
 understand their own past, right? What are some of the motivations, do you think? And again,

39:06.800 --> 39:11.760
 from our perspective, us as humans, what motivations would we have when we approach

39:11.760 --> 39:14.160
 other civilizations we might discover in the future?

39:14.160 --> 39:23.840
 Well, I think one motivation might be to steer us away from the precipice, right? Or on the assumption

39:23.840 --> 39:30.720
 that even if we make it past the precipice, at least we're not a bunch of psychopaths

39:31.760 --> 39:36.880
 running around. So maybe there's a little bit of motivation there to make sure that the neighbor

39:36.880 --> 39:45.760
 that's growing up next to you is not unruly. But maybe it's sort of a moral imperative,

39:46.480 --> 39:56.160
 like what we have with creating national parks where animals can continue to live out their

39:56.160 --> 40:08.480
 lives in a natural way. I don't know. The problem is we're imagining from an anthropomorphic viewpoint

40:08.480 --> 40:15.280
 what an alien might think. And as I've said before, alien means alien, right? I mean,

40:15.280 --> 40:23.600
 not Hollywood aliens, but a whole different way of thinking and a whole different level of experience

40:23.600 --> 40:31.760
 and let's say wisdom, hopefully, that we could only hope to understand. Now, but if we ever get

40:31.760 --> 40:38.400
 out there, if we ever make it past our current problems, and even if we don't have faster than

40:38.400 --> 40:46.000
 light travel, and even if we're only using ram scoops or light sails to get where we want to go,

40:46.000 --> 40:53.760
 and it takes us 10,000 years to get somewhere or to spread out, we might encounter such things.

40:53.760 --> 41:00.720
 And we're just going to stomp all over it, like we did in colonial South America or Africa or all

41:00.720 --> 41:05.760
 the rest on our current path, likely. And so what are we going to learn?

41:05.760 --> 41:12.800
 Well, we're getting better and better at understanding what is life. And I think we're

41:12.800 --> 41:19.040
 getting better and better at being careful not to step on it when we see it. And this is one of

41:19.040 --> 41:25.120
 the nice things about talking about UFOs is it expands the overton window, it expands our

41:25.120 --> 41:31.040
 understanding of what possibly could be life. It gets us to think, it gets the scientific community

41:31.040 --> 41:35.920
 to think. When we go to Mars, when we go to these different moons that possibly have life,

41:35.920 --> 41:43.920
 you know, we're not looking at legged organisms, we're looking at some kind of complexity

41:45.360 --> 41:54.080
 that arises in resistance to the natural world. And there's a lot of interesting...

41:54.080 --> 41:56.640
 I like that resistance to the natural world. Yeah.

41:57.520 --> 42:04.560
 Somehow there's a rebellious process, complex system going on here. And I don't know, you know,

42:04.560 --> 42:10.000
 the many ways it could take form. And there's a sense, you know, for aliens that

42:10.880 --> 42:18.080
 as the technology develops, they take form more and more as information, as something that can

42:18.080 --> 42:27.440
 influence the space of ideas, of the processing of data itself. So I just, this idea of embodiment

42:27.440 --> 42:38.000
 that we humans so admire, physically visible, perceivable embodiment may be a very inefficient

42:38.000 --> 42:46.480
 thing. Right. If you think just about, you know, your area, AI, you know, we're trying to make smaller

42:46.480 --> 42:58.400
 and smaller and smaller circuitry that is basically closer and closer to the physics of how the

42:58.400 --> 43:03.120
 universe operates, right, right down at the level of, I mean, quantum computers are basically

43:03.120 --> 43:09.760
 right down about quantum information storage. So fast forward 10,000, 100,000 years,

43:09.760 --> 43:16.720
 maybe somebody found a way to embody AI directly into the physics of the universe, right? And it

43:16.720 --> 43:24.480
 doesn't require physical manifestation. It just sits in space time. It's just a locally ordered

43:24.480 --> 43:31.200
 space. We're just locally ordered space time, right? You know, I mean, people, but maybe they

43:31.200 --> 43:37.120
 found a way to embody it there. They probably have to get really good at not, you know, trampling on

43:37.120 --> 43:42.400
 the ants. The better your technology gets, the easier it is to accidentally like, oops,

43:44.160 --> 43:49.920
 just destroy these simpleton biological systems. We constantly think about whatever these things

43:49.920 --> 43:58.000
 might be. We think that they are some sort of a unified force. Well, maybe they're not unified.

43:58.720 --> 44:06.080
 Maybe they are as disparate as you and I are. And maybe what keeps them from stomping all over

44:06.080 --> 44:15.520
 the ants is each other, right? That they are in a self tension to prevent one or more of them from

44:15.520 --> 44:22.400
 running amok. Oh, yeah. I mean, that's kind of the anarchy of nations that we have on earth. So

44:22.400 --> 44:29.440
 there's always, there's always going to be this hierarchy, this hierarchy that's formed

44:29.440 --> 44:33.600
 of greater and greater intelligences. And they're all probably also wondering,

44:33.600 --> 44:39.200
 wait, what's bigger than me? Exactly. That's what I always wonder is that maybe that they're,

44:39.200 --> 44:45.120
 what keeps them in line is something that is beyond them. Like what created the universe?

44:45.120 --> 44:52.240
 I mean, that's probably a question that bothers them too. What about the communication task itself?

44:52.960 --> 44:57.760
 How hard do you think it is for aliens to communicate with humans? So is this something you

44:57.760 --> 45:04.160
 think about about this barrier of communication between biological systems and something else?

45:04.880 --> 45:07.200
 How difficult is it to find a common language?

45:08.400 --> 45:15.520
 Well, I think if you're smart enough, or technologically enabled enough, it's relatively

45:15.520 --> 45:28.560
 straightforward. Now, whether your concepts can ever be dumbed down to us, that might be hard.

45:30.720 --> 45:34.160
 Again, talking to the ants. Talking to the ants. On Instagram.

45:38.160 --> 45:41.440
 You want to look good in this picture? Let me explain to you why.

45:41.440 --> 45:52.480
 Yeah. So that's the essential problem of, perhaps they realize who it is that they're

45:52.480 --> 45:58.800
 talking to. And they say, rather than muddy the picture, we're only going to give them

45:58.800 --> 46:05.280
 limited information. Yeah. Right. And yeah, maybe we could sit down like you and I and have a

46:05.280 --> 46:10.640
 conversation. But then they would make assumptions. The humans would then make assumptions about us

46:10.640 --> 46:17.680
 that aren't true. Because we're not humans. Right? So let's stay at arm's length. Let's

46:17.680 --> 46:23.600
 just let them know that we're here. Right? And here's the limited amount of communication.

46:23.600 --> 46:32.400
 Again, this notion that if you give somebody everything, they'll get lazy. And if they've

46:32.400 --> 46:36.400
 been around as long as they have, they've seen every kind of thing that can go wrong.

46:36.400 --> 46:44.160
 And so it's, they know as much as they might want to step in, that would be a wrong thing.

46:45.520 --> 46:49.360
 Yeah. You have to also understand that the amount of wisdom they carry.

46:50.160 --> 46:57.360
 Yeah. And so it's very easy as well for religions to, I don't want to get

46:57.360 --> 47:01.920
 into a whole religious conversation, but you could, very easy for, you could see how religions

47:01.920 --> 47:09.200
 could call them angels or devils or what have you. Because again, if you're trying to fit it into a

47:09.200 --> 47:19.200
 framework of cultural understanding, the first thing you reach for is God. And so it, when you,

47:19.200 --> 47:23.280
 when you look at what these things are, and again, with the angels and the devils,

47:24.240 --> 47:30.400
 in a similar sort of way, their communication is limited. They just kind of give little,

47:30.400 --> 47:37.120
 what's the oracle of Delphi? They kind of give these Delphic pronouncements. And then it's up to

47:37.120 --> 47:44.480
 you to figure out what it is that they really mean. Stephen Greer claimed that a skeleton

47:44.480 --> 47:51.120
 discovered in Atacama region of Chile might be an alien. You reached out to him and

47:52.640 --> 47:58.240
 took on the task of proving or disproving that with the rigor of science. The result is a paper

47:58.240 --> 48:05.200
 titled, Whole Genome Sequencing of Atacama Skeleton Shows Novel Mutations Linked with Displasia.

48:06.160 --> 48:14.400
 Can you tell this full story? The story was, as you put it right there, correct. Reached out,

48:15.680 --> 48:24.320
 got a sample of the body, did the DNA sequencing, then worked with a team of two other Stanford

48:24.320 --> 48:32.160
 scientists and Roche Sequencing Group, Roche Diagnostics, and probably a total team of about

48:32.160 --> 48:39.440
 11 or so people. And as is standard in these kinds of things, the professors actually don't do the

48:39.440 --> 48:46.240
 work. The students do the work and figured out the answer. And then we helped them put together the

48:46.240 --> 48:55.760
 story. And the story was simply that it was human, 100%. I went into it thinking it was originally

48:55.760 --> 49:02.960
 a monkey of some sort. I got kind of excited a few months into the process thinking, well,

49:02.960 --> 49:08.160
 what happens if it is an alien, right? Can you describe some of the characteristics of the

49:08.160 --> 49:13.120
 skeleton that make it unique and interesting? Primarily, it had dysmorphias of the brain.

49:13.120 --> 49:18.800
 And so the first thing I did, actually, when I got pictures of it, I took it to a local expert at

49:18.800 --> 49:29.200
 Stanford, and he was on the paper. And he was the world expert in pediatric bone dysmorphias.

49:29.200 --> 49:35.840
 He literally wrote the book on this, because that's what you do. You go to an expert when

49:35.840 --> 49:40.720
 he's outside of your field of interest. And he said, well, I haven't seen this particular

49:40.720 --> 49:49.200
 collection of mutations before, or this physiology before, but here's what I think it might be.

49:50.800 --> 49:57.120
 And he said, but based on the size of the thing and the bone density,

49:58.160 --> 50:06.640
 it would appear to be like six or seven years old. Now, again, that's the thing where I think the

50:06.640 --> 50:14.400
 lay public doesn't understand or takes a speculation like that and turns it into a fact.

50:15.360 --> 50:20.880
 No one ever said that it was that age. We only said that the bones made it look like it was that age.

50:21.520 --> 50:27.760
 But then we went back and looked for genetic explanations of why things might look the way

50:27.760 --> 50:35.440
 they did. And if you, again, read the paper is very carefully caveated to say that these mutations

50:35.440 --> 50:45.200
 might result in this. But what we did find was an unexpectedly large number of mutations associated

50:45.200 --> 50:52.320
 with bone growth in this individual. And it was just a bad role of the dice, right? You roll

50:52.320 --> 51:00.240
 the dice enough times with enough people born every year, and someone will roll the wrong dice

51:00.240 --> 51:07.360
 all at once. So the sad part about it was individuals in the UFO community who wanted to

51:07.360 --> 51:14.720
 think that there was some sort of conspiracy around it, right? That somebody had somehow

51:14.720 --> 51:23.520
 convinced all of my students to lie. I mean, come on. I would lose my job, first of all,

51:23.520 --> 51:31.200
 and they would all be in trouble forever. Yeah. But also it's just projecting malevolence

51:31.200 --> 51:37.920
 onto people that I don't think exist in normal populace and especially doesn't exist in the

51:37.920 --> 51:42.160
 scientific community. The kind of people that go into science, I mean, this is what bothers me

51:42.160 --> 51:49.840
 with the current distrust of science, is they might be naive. They might not, especially modern

51:49.840 --> 51:54.720
 science, look at the big picture, philosophical ethical questions, all that kind of stuff. But

51:54.720 --> 52:03.040
 ultimately, they're people with integrity and just a deep curiosity for the discovery of cool,

52:03.040 --> 52:13.520
 little things. And there's no malevolence, broadly speaking, in the scientific community. So I mean,

52:13.520 --> 52:20.880
 there's a bigger story here, which is there's a hunger in the populace to discover something

52:20.880 --> 52:27.600
 anomalous, something new. And science has to be both open to the anomalous, but also to reject

52:28.160 --> 52:34.160
 the anomalous when the data doesn't support it. What do you make of that walking that line for

52:34.160 --> 52:41.040
 you? Because you're dealing with UFO encounters, you're dealing with UFOs, you're dealing with

52:41.040 --> 52:48.960
 UFO encounters, you're dealing with the anomalous. Well, people have said, let's go back to the

52:48.960 --> 52:55.680
 Atacama case that I was debunking it. Well, debunking is a loaded term, sort of assumes that

52:55.680 --> 53:02.560
 you were going in purposefully to prove something is wrong. I wasn't, I was just going in to collect

53:02.560 --> 53:10.160
 the data. And, you know, I showed that this one was human. There was another skull that somebody

53:10.160 --> 53:14.800
 had at one point, it was called the Star Child, they called it the Star Child skull. I said,

53:14.800 --> 53:18.400
 you know, I looked at it, I looked at the DNA sequencing that they had done. I said, this is

53:18.400 --> 53:26.640
 human. End of story. The people who owned the thing at the time disagreed with me. And then

53:26.640 --> 53:32.400
 eventually, another group came in and proved that I was right. And it's not about debunking. It's

53:32.400 --> 53:38.640
 about getting the more spectacular and hyped cases off the table. I mean, the reason I got

53:38.640 --> 53:42.640
 interested in it is because somebody was hyping it. And not because I wanted to disprove it,

53:42.640 --> 53:46.800
 but because I just wanted to know. And let's get it off the table, because it's usually

53:46.800 --> 53:55.520
 the most extravagant things that are most likely to be wrong. Somewhere in the rubble will be

53:55.520 --> 54:01.280
 something interesting. And so that's what you do. You get the, you get the, the, the dross off the

54:01.280 --> 54:10.880
 table. And then somewhere in the data will be something worth real inquiry. And that if you

54:10.880 --> 54:16.560
 inquire deeply enough will be extravagant. Yes. Exactly. And that's what actually excites scientists

54:16.560 --> 54:23.360
 is to, I mean, you want with the rigor of science to actually reveal the extravagant.

54:23.920 --> 54:30.480
 And so look at CRISPR as probably the most perfect example of that. These weird sequences

54:30.480 --> 54:37.040
 in bacterial genomes all arrayed one after the other with these strange sequences around them.

54:37.040 --> 54:42.640
 But when you looked at the sequences, they looked like viruses. And so how did they get there?

54:42.640 --> 54:47.280
 And lo and behold, after, you know, a lot of effort and work, well, a couple of Nobel prizes

54:47.280 --> 54:55.680
 went out the door, but these strange things ended up having extraordinarily extravagant

54:55.680 --> 55:02.000
 possibilities. You've also looked at UFO materials. You are in possession of UFO

55:02.000 --> 55:09.040
 materials yourself. Claimed UFO materials. Alleged. Alleged UFO materials. That's right. So

55:10.240 --> 55:17.680
 what's another term? Weird materials that don't seem to have a story. They have a

55:17.680 --> 55:24.960
 story that doesn't seem to be of natural origins, but it's not, you know, there's a process to

55:24.960 --> 55:31.440
 proving that. And that process may take decades, if not centuries, because you have to keep

55:31.440 --> 55:36.960
 pulling at the string and discover where they could possibly come from. But anyway, you're

55:36.960 --> 55:45.760
 in possession of some materials of this kind. Can you describe some of them? And maybe also

55:45.760 --> 55:51.520
 talk to the process of how you investigate them? How do you analyze them? Right. So let's say that

55:51.520 --> 55:57.840
 there's two classes of materials that I've been given by people and not given by like the government

55:57.840 --> 56:02.480
 or anything, just given people who've collected them. And there's a reasonable chain of evidence

56:02.480 --> 56:06.720
 associated with them that you believe is not just a pebble, somebody picked up off a road.

56:09.440 --> 56:15.200
 There are almost always things that people have claimed have either been dropped off as like some

56:15.200 --> 56:26.480
 sort of a leftover material, molten metals, or they are from an object that was released from this,

56:26.480 --> 56:32.560
 so that kind of exploded. They're almost always metals. I have some couple of things that might

56:32.560 --> 56:35.840
 be biological that are interesting that I haven't really spent a lot of time on yet.

56:36.560 --> 56:42.960
 When you look at a metal, you basically, well, okay, what are the elements in it? And what's

56:42.960 --> 56:48.640
 it made of? And so there's pretty standard approaches to doing that. Most of them involve

56:48.640 --> 56:53.280
 a technology called mass spectrometry. And there's probably about five or six different kinds of

56:53.280 --> 56:59.360
 mass spectrometry that you could bring to bear on answering it. And they either tell you, depending

56:59.360 --> 57:04.400
 upon the limit of the resolution of the instrument, they either tell you the elements that are there,

57:05.040 --> 57:09.120
 or they tell you the isotopes that are there. And you're interested not just in knowing whether

57:09.120 --> 57:14.800
 something is there or not, you're interested in knowing whether there are, you know, the

57:16.000 --> 57:24.000
 amounts of it. And in the case of elements, how many different isotopes are there? And that's

57:24.000 --> 57:29.200
 kind of where in some of these cases, it gets interesting, right? Because in at least one of

57:29.200 --> 57:35.760
 the materials, as we first studied it, the isotope ratios of in this case, it was magnesium or way

57:35.760 --> 57:44.240
 off normal. And I just don't know why it doesn't it doesn't prove anything. It just all it proves is

57:44.960 --> 57:52.320
 that it was probably accomplished by some kind of an industrial process, whether it's the result

57:53.200 --> 57:59.600
 of a process or whether and this is sort of the leftover, or whether it was made that way

57:59.600 --> 58:07.280
 for a particular purpose. I don't know. All I know is that it it was engineered.

58:09.760 --> 58:17.840
 That's it, right? But then it's the question is, sort of you go one step deeper. Why would you

58:17.840 --> 58:25.120
 engineer it? Right? Well, why? And what does the engineered means? There's all kinds of,

58:25.120 --> 58:33.440
 it could be a byproduct, it could be the main result of an engineering process.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.240
 It would be a small part of the engineering process that is the main part.

58:38.960 --> 58:45.920
 Well, so the ratios of isotopes for any given element are basically the result of stellar

58:45.920 --> 58:55.600
 processes. Supernova blew up sometime several tens, you know, several billion years ago. That

58:55.600 --> 59:04.720
 became a cloud. Those atoms coalesced gravitationally to form another sun and a ring that became a

59:04.720 --> 59:13.360
 rocky planet. And the ratios of the isotopes were determined at the time of that explosion.

59:13.360 --> 59:19.360
 And so everything in the local solar system is more or less of that ratio, depending upon certain

59:19.360 --> 59:27.600
 gravitational difference. But by fragments of a percent, not whole tens of percent difference.

59:28.480 --> 59:34.640
 So what do humans use isotopes for? Mostly to blow stuff up. I mean, the vast majority of the

59:34.640 --> 59:42.240
 isotopes that have been made in the per pound or ton are things like certain ratios of plutonium,

59:42.240 --> 59:50.560
 and uranium to blow stuff up. We don't make or engineer isotopes, which it's today is relatively

59:50.560 --> 59:58.160
 easy to do, but it's still expensive. For any other reason, apart from, let's say, as anti cancer,

59:59.360 --> 1:00:05.200
 we use stable isotopes and money these days as a counterfeiting tool. You basically embed

1:00:05.200 --> 1:00:10.960
 certain ratios of isotopes in to make it harder for counterfeiters to accomplish.

1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:18.080
 And so, but other than that, we don't do anything with that. So why would you make

1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:24.400
 grams of such material in this one case and drop it around on a beach in Brazil?

1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:30.400
 So which case are we talking about? This is the this is the uva tuba case.

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:34.400
 Can you describe this case a little bit further? Like what material we're talking about,

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:37.360
 just the full story of the case. So it's an interesting one.

1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:45.120
 It's an interesting one. So a fisherman saw an object that released something or it exploded.

1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:53.200
 And it was this relative, I've got some big chunks of it, relatively pure magnesium

1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:58.640
 with obviously something else in it because magnesium burns. So it had something in it that

1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:08.240
 would other metals, simple alloy, that would prevent it from basically burning up. And so the

1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:15.600
 question is, and so then we had we had two pieces that came from two different chains of custody,

1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:22.800
 both claimed to be from the same object, at least physically, when you look at the two

1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:29.680
 things, they look the same, right? So we took small fragments of each of them,

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:34.880
 we put them in an instrument called a secondary ion mass spec, which is an extremely sensitive

1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:44.320
 instrument. And it can see down to 0.0001 mass units, which is important for, let's say,

1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:52.720
 more arcane reasons, but it's a sensitive instrument. And so one of the chains of custody,

1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:57.600
 we had two pieces from the same chain of custody, and then two pieces from the other chain of custody,

1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:06.480
 one of them had completely normal magnesium isotope ratios, magnesium 24, 25, 26,

1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:10.880
 and the other was off, not just like slightly off, way off, and they were both off to the same

1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:18.640
 extent. So, I mean, it was sort of like you had an internal control of what was normal,

1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:26.080
 then you had this other one, which was, which was wrong. And so you're left with kind of an

1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:32.240
 open question. Was this a hoax? Were these two chains of custody, one of them a hoax,

1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:36.480
 that somebody purposefully introduced those things? Because you could do it. It would

1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:42.960
 cost a lot. I mean, at the time that this was found, I guess the 1970s or so,

1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:50.800
 might have been earlier, I forget. The amount that I had would have cost several tens of thousands

1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:56.720
 of dollars to make. And again, it's not something you would just throw around. And why would you

1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:02.160
 do it in the hope that some guy 30 years from then would pick it up and study it?

1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:09.840
 Yeah, it's a very subtle, subtle draw. Yeah, it's a long term plan. So, I just don't know,

1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:15.840
 I just don't know what to make of it, except it's interesting. But it's, so a different

1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:22.800
 kind of question that you're asking is, what constitutes evidence, right? So, is this

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:30.320
 sufficient evidence? Absolutely not. But somebody's put it forward, I have the time,

1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:37.360
 it's my time. I'll study it. And I, my objective is to sort of take those that I think are credible

1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:42.320
 enough and do a reasonable analysis, put it out there. And maybe somebody else will come up with

1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:50.960
 an idea as to what it is. Now, what would be better is some sort of true technology, right?

1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:58.320
 Something that is obviously, we don't have it. You know, and people like Neil deGrasse Tyson

1:03:58.320 --> 1:04:05.680
 and Seth Shostak have come out rightfully and have said, you know, when you show up with,

1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:12.640
 you know, something really obviously technology that we don't understand,

1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:18.560
 you know, then we'll pay attention, right? Not just material. Not just material. A piece of

1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:26.400
 metal is, is interesting. But, and several of the things that I've looked at and things that

1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:32.000
 people, other things that people have come to me with, we've found to be completely banal,

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:39.600
 or we're actually pieces of aircraft that were invented back in the 1940s. And so, take them

1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:48.560
 off the table. See, but I think, again, I think showing up with technology that humans would

1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:54.720
 find completely novel is actually a really difficult task for aliens, because it obviously

1:04:54.720 --> 1:05:00.240
 can't be so novel that we don't recognize it. For what it is. Yeah. For what it is. And so,

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:06.320
 and I would say most of the technology aliens likely have would be something we don't recognize.

1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:13.360
 So they, it's actually a hard problem how to convince ants. Like, you first have to understand

1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:20.320
 what ants are tweeting about, like what, what they care about in order to like inject into their

1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:27.840
 culture. Because, you know, that's why I think it would be the technology that you could present

1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:35.120
 is in the space of ideas is in the, is try to influence individual humans with the encounters

1:05:35.680 --> 1:05:43.200
 and try to, with this kind of thing that you mentioned about us not taking messages about us

1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:49.600
 not taking care of the world. It's difficult to, I mean, I, to, for them to understand,

1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:56.880
 you have to come up with trinkets that impress us. I mean, maybe the very technology, the fascination

1:05:56.880 --> 1:06:01.360
 with the development of technology and the development of technology, the actual act of

1:06:01.360 --> 1:06:06.640
 innovation itself is the thing that they're communicating. Right. I mean, this is kind

1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:13.040
 of what, you know, Jacques Valais thinks about is the role of the control system. He calls it

1:06:13.040 --> 1:06:21.280
 the control system. Well, let me ask about Jacques. Who is he? You know him. Who is Jacques Valais?

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:31.520
 What have you learned from him about life, about about UFOs, about technology, about our

1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:38.480
 role in the universe? Well, I met Jacques actually soon after the whole Atacama thing happened.

1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:45.200
 And I was visited by those people associated with the government and the whatever around the

1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:51.040
 Havana, what ended up mostly being Havana syndrome patients, but also Jacques at the

1:06:51.040 --> 1:06:55.680
 same time. And they were actually working behind the scenes with each other that, oh, here's this

1:06:55.680 --> 1:07:00.080
 Stanford professor who is willing to talk about this stuff and investigate things.

1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:06.800
 Maybe we should go talk to him. And he, he reached out through a colleague and, you know,

1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:15.440
 I had lunch actually at the Rosewood Inn upon near Sandhill. So Jacques is one of the first

1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:25.040
 openly active scientists. And he's really a scientist in this area, going back to the 1960s.

1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:34.560
 And, you know, he's put forward a number of ideas, speculations about what it might be

1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:38.640
 that people are interacting with. And he, the first thing that I learned from him is this

1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:45.040
 notion of what he called Kabuki Theater, that many of the things that people have seen are,

1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:48.960
 I remember reading his books and thinking, he uses this word absurd a lot.

1:07:50.480 --> 1:07:57.680
 He said, the things that people claim they see are absurd, right? A ship doesn't land

1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:03.120
 in a farmer's field, and then come up and knock on the door and say, can I have a glass

1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:08.720
 of water? And these are stories literally out of newspapers from the 1930s. It's absurd.

1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:13.920
 You know, and the other thing that people say, ships don't crash. If you're so technologically

1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:23.680
 advanced, you don't crash. It's absurd that they crash. So he says, this is put on as a show.

1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:31.760
 It's meant to, it's an influence campaign, right? It's, it's not meant to influence individuals,

1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:37.520
 it's meant to influence a culture as a whole. Maybe they don't look at us as individuals,

1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:43.360
 maybe they look at us as an organism that lives on a planet, right?

1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:48.160
 And perhaps rightly so. And so that's how you interact with them. That's how you influence

1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:52.960
 them. So that was one of the first things that kind of took me back and realized, wow, there's

1:08:52.960 --> 1:09:00.560
 actually a, maybe there's a puppet master behind the scenes that's, you know, doing this influencing

1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:06.800
 that all this stuff about aliens is just, is not true per se. They're just a representation of

1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:11.440
 something that is meant to influence. So that was probably the most interesting thing. I mean,

1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:17.200
 the man is brilliant. He's also, it can be, and I'm sorry, Jacques, he can also be incredibly

1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:24.240
 annoying to have a conversation with because he will pick apart your arguments or anything that

1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:29.840
 you think you know, and show you why you don't know what you think you know. And he uses the,

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:38.560
 he used the example that for me, that is, is all you need is one counter example to any

1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:44.720
 conclusion, and you're wrong. And so I learned from him, I mean, I'm supposed to be a good

1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:50.080
 scientist, but I learned from him, don't talk about conclusions, just talk about the data.

1:09:50.720 --> 1:09:54.640
 Because data is not wrong. I mean, convince yourself that the data is not wrong or not an

1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:59.680
 artifact, but be careful about your conclusions because whatever is going on, it's, it's much

1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:05.520
 more complicated than we, than we imagine. Well, that's powerful. Being able to always step back

1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:10.160
 because we get, we humans get excited. Yeah. We start to jump to conclusions from the data,

1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:14.640
 but always step back. Well, powerful. Being able to always step back because we get, we humans

1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:19.760
 get excited. Yeah. We start to jump to conclusions from the data, but always step back. Well,

1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:24.480
 in some of my Twitter feeds, when I dare to go on Twitter are full of, well, when are you going

1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:30.320
 to give us the answer? Well, you know, science is not immediate. You're going to have to be patient.

1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:35.920
 And even some of my science colleagues have said, well, where's the data? My answer then has been,

1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:41.120
 where's been your work to try to produce any? You know, I'm not here to give you everything

1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:47.200
 on a silver platter. We talked offline, how much I love data and machine learning and so on.

1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:54.240
 And it's been really disheartening to see the US government not invest as much as they possibly

1:10:54.240 --> 1:11:00.000
 could into this whole process. So let's jump to the most recent thing, which is what do you make

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:06.880
 of the report titled preliminary assessment on identified aerial phenomena that was released

1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:12.800
 by the office of the director of national intelligence in June, 2021. So this was like,

1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:20.560
 okay, we're going to step back. And we're going to like what, where do we stand and where do we

1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:24.800
 hope the future is? What do you make of that report? Is it hopeful? Is it? I see it is very

1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:31.760
 hopeful, very hopeful. I think the adults are finally stepping up in and being in charge, right?

1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:39.200
 In the good sense of adult. What's that? In the good sense of adult. Childlike curiosity is pretty

1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:45.120
 powerful thing. That's true. Yeah. It's, but it's also, I think the people who were worried

1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:49.520
 that the populace at large might run screaming into the streets and riot.

1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:54.560
 You know, they have, you know, they basically, the empiric evidence is they're wrong.

1:11:55.200 --> 1:11:59.680
 You know, this, these videos and all these things have been out for now, what, five years?

1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:06.080
 Most people don't even know about it, right? So as, as, as hyped as it's been and all over

1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:11.760
 the newspapers that it's been and et cetera, you know, even Tucker Carlson has talked about it many

1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:17.760
 times on his news program. Joe Rogan has a lot of people don't know about it. So I think people,

1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:22.160
 if it's not affecting their day to day life, they're going on with their day to day life.

1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:31.360
 So, but that said, I think it was an important sea change in the internal discussions going on in

1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:39.120
 the government because, and the reason being that I think this is actually partly true with the,

1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:46.320
 the maturation of human social technology. It was becoming so obvious that this stuff was

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:50.640
 showing up again and again and again around our ships. They just couldn't keep it quiet anymore.

1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:55.760
 Right. And so it's like, we need to do something about it. And Lou Elizondo and Chris and others

1:12:55.760 --> 1:13:02.160
 to their great credit found the right angle to talk about this. It says, well, okay, let's say

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:08.240
 it's not out there. Maybe it's the Russians, the Chinese or somebody else, we should know about this

1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:17.360
 because we damn sure know it's not us. So that to me is an important thing to, to finally be a

1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:24.480
 little bit more open about the matter. But like I often say, I'm not looking for people to give

1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:29.040
 me permission to do anything. I'm just going to do the analysis myself with what I have.

1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:34.080
 Avi Loeb has taken the same approach. He said, I'm not going to wait for the government to give me

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:41.840
 telescopic information about technologies or things that might be even on our own solar system.

1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:46.560
 I'm just going to collect it myself. And, and that's the right way to do it. Right. Don't

1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:52.480
 wait for somebody else to give it to you. It's also possible to inspire a large number of people

1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:59.440
 to do a wider spread data collection. Yes. I mean, you yourself can't do a large enough data

1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:05.200
 collection that would, if you're talking about anomalous events, right, right, you should be

1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:11.600
 collecting high resolution data about everything that's happening on earth in terms of like,

1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:19.040
 in terms of the kind of things that would indicate to you a strong signal that something weird

1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:26.080
 happened here. And this is why governments can be good at funding large scale efforts.

1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:34.400
 Yes. I mean, NASA and so on working with SpaceX with Blue Origin to fund

1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:42.240
 capitalistic sort of fund companies, fund company efforts to do huge moonshot projects.

1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:48.000
 Right. And in the same way, do huge moonshot data collection efforts in terms of UFOs. I mean,

1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:54.240
 we're not, it needs to be like 10x, like one or two orders of magnitude more funding to do this

1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:59.680
 kind of thing. And I understand on the flip side of that, if you make it about what are the Russians,

1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:06.960
 whether the Chinese doing, you know, make it a question of geopolitics, it gets touchy because

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:13.120
 now you, you kind of taken away from the realm of science and making it military, making it

1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:18.560
 military. Some of the greatest, this is what makes me as an engineer, makes me truly sad that some

1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:24.960
 of the greatest engineering work ever done is by Lockheed Martin. And we will never know about it.

1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:31.600
 Yeah, I agree. I agree. I wish we were, it was different, but it's the world we live in.

1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:39.600
 You know, but related to that UIP task force announcement that you just said, you know,

1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:44.800
 the bill was passed in the Department of Defense and now it formally establishes an office to

1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:51.680
 collate that information and also to be transparent about it. Money is now set aside.

1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:57.600
 Right. Well, what do you think of just in case people don't know the DOD establishing new department

1:15:57.600 --> 1:16:05.520
 to study UFOs called airborne naming, come on. But yes, airborne object identification and

1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:12.000
 management synchronization group. Do you know how to pronounce that? No, I do not. AOI MSG.

1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:18.480
 It's stupid and needs to be renamed, but AOI MSG AO, all right, is directed by the

1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:23.520
 Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security. What do you make of this office?

1:16:24.160 --> 1:16:29.600
 Are you hopeful about this office? I think there's still a tug of war going on behind the scenes

1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:35.360
 as to who's going to control this. But I do know though that money has been set aside that

1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:46.960
 will be used to make things more public, right, to start to get others involved. And you know,

1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:51.680
 there's, I'm involved with an effort to get other academics involved.

1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:55.840
 So you think there might be some of that money could be directed towards funding, maybe like

1:16:55.840 --> 1:17:01.040
 groups like yours to do some research here. So they would be open to that, you think?

1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:07.120
 I hope so. I mean, nothing is set in stone yet. And I'm not hiding anything because I just don't

1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:16.800
 know anything, right? But I do think that there will be public efforts. Now, there are being

1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:24.400
 set up other private efforts to bring monies involved and to use that to leverage and get

1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:32.080
 access to some of the internal resources as well. So what you're seeing is kind of an ecosystem

1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:40.320
 building up in a positive sense of people who are willing to do the research. So, you know,

1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:44.000
 before it would be, you couldn't even go to a scientist and ask them to help.

1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:50.320
 Now, if there's money, as I said before, scientists are essentially capitalists. We go

1:17:50.320 --> 1:17:54.800
 where the money is. I mean, the work that I've done, I did out of my own pocket.

1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:01.680
 And probably about $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 of money went into the paper we published

1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:09.120
 out of my own pocket. But the amount of money that needs to go in is in at least the few

1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:15.600
 millions to do a proper analysis of these materials. The work I know that the Galileo

1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:23.200
 project is involved with, it's probably in the five to 10 million range to get stuff done.

1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:29.520
 But that's actually a relatively modest amount of money to accomplish something that has been in

1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:37.200
 the zeitgeist for decades. I should also push back a little bit on something you probably will

1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:42.960
 agree with. You said scientists are essentially capitalists. What I've noticed is there's certainly

1:18:42.960 --> 1:18:47.840
 an influence of money. But oftentimes when you're talking about basic research and basic science,

1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:56.160
 the money is a little bit ambiguous to what direction you're doing the research in.

1:18:56.160 --> 1:19:01.680
 And the scientists get really good at telling a narrative of like, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:08.160
 we're fulfilling the purpose of this funding. But they end up doing really what they're curious

1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:12.960
 about. And of course, you cannot deviate like, if you're getting funded to study penguins and

1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:18.880
 Antarctica, you can't start building rockets, but probably you can because you'll convince some kind

1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:23.520
 you concoct the narrative saying, rockets are really important for studying penguins in the

1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:31.600
 entire right. I think that's actually, this is one thing I think people don't generally understand

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:37.360
 about the scientific mind is I don't know how capitalistic it is, because if it was,

1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:42.320
 they would start an FN company. No, no, no, no. I mean, when I meant capitalist, I didn't mean

1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:49.040
 in the, they'll start companies per se. I mean, we can only do the research where there's money.

1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:56.560
 And so from, you know, maybe it's a bad use of the term capitalist. So, but the,

1:19:57.600 --> 1:20:01.200
 we will only do the research where there's money. I mean, why do most people work,

1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:08.800
 many biologists work in cancer research, because there's a lot of money there. It's an important

1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:15.760
 problem. But I might not have ever gotten involved in it. If there wasn't money, I might have gone

1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:23.280
 and I was going to be a botanist when I, when I was a kid. That's what I wanted to do. So,

1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:30.960
 having money available will bring people to bear. Now, another mistake that's often actually made,

1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:36.640
 I think, by the lay public about science is that people think that we're paid to do things.

1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:41.600
 Just as you said, I get a research grant and luckily from the NIH there, they give you a fair

1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:46.880
 amount of latitude. I will go my own way and I'll find something, I might have proposed something,

1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:52.160
 but I'll end up somewhere entirely different by the end of the project. And that's how good

1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:58.960
 science is done. You follow the, you follow the data, you follow the results. And so that's what

1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:05.760
 I'm hoping can be done here. I think the worst kind of thing that could be done with this

1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:12.640
 subject area is to put it inside another company where they have a set plan of what it is they're

1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:17.040
 going to do and the scientists either tell, do what the executives tell them to do or not.

1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:23.360
 That isn't how anything will really get discovered. Put it, get it out into the public,

1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:29.120
 get open minds thinking about it and then publishing on it and doing the right kind

1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:32.640
 of work. That's how real progress will be made with this.

1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:39.600
 Let's again put our sort of philosophical hats on. Do you think the US government or some other

1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:49.040
 government is in possession of something of extraterrestrial origin that is far more impressive

1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:56.240
 than anything we've seen in the public? I've not seen anything personally,

1:21:56.240 --> 1:22:01.280
 but if I believe the people who I don't think can lie, yes.

1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:08.320
 How does that make you feel in terms of the way government works, the way our human civilization

1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:15.200
 works, that there might be things like that and they're not public? Is there a hopeful message

1:22:15.200 --> 1:22:21.920
 for transparency that's possible? If you were in power, and I'm not saying president because

1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:29.520
 maybe the president is not the source of power here, would you release this information in some

1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:38.320
 way or form? Yes, if I were. I think it's something that can bring humanity together.

1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:47.760
 I think that knowledge of this kind of thing to know that we are more alike than we are different

1:22:48.320 --> 1:23:00.480
 in comparison to whatever this is is a positive thing for us. I don't necessarily

1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:04.560
 care that the government has been hiding it and I think people who've been talking about

1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:09.680
 we should give government officials or whatever amnesty, I think that's probably the right

1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:16.320
 answer. This isn't a time to look back and say you did something wrong. You did whatever you

1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:20.080
 did because that was the data you had available to you at the time and you had good reasons for

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:26.080
 doing it. Now, if your reasons were selfish, if your reasons were you wanted to do it because

1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:33.440
 you wanted to monetize it yourself to your benefit but against that of others, then I think maybe

1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:39.520
 there's something else that could be said but an opportunity to get all this information out,

1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:46.720
 if I were in charge, I would try to do it. Now, I might be shown something though that says there's

1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:51.520
 a reason why you don't want to let anybody know this. Maybe you don't want everybody having access

1:23:51.520 --> 1:23:59.920
 to unlimited energy because maybe you might turn it into a bomb or something that gives you hints

1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:05.120
 that something like unlimited energy is possible but you haven't figured it out yet and if you

1:24:05.120 --> 1:24:11.040
 make it public, maybe some of the other governments you have tensions with will figure it out first.

1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:18.560
 It's kind of an arms race going on, I think. In all forms and it makes me truly sad because

1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:28.480
 it's obvious that for example, the origins of the COVID virus, it's obvious to me that the

1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:35.840
 Chinese government, whatever the origins are, is interested in not releasing information about it

1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:42.640
 because it can only be bad for the Chinese government. Every government thinks like this.

1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:51.920
 Every actually, this has been disappointment to me talking to PR folks at companies. They're

1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:59.360
 always nervous. They're always conservative in the sense like, well, if we release more stuff,

1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:07.680
 it can only be bad. Then an Elon Musk character comes along who tweets ridiculous memes

1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:14.080
 and doesn't give a fuck. I've been encouraging CEOs, I've been encouraging people to be

1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:20.080
 transparent. Of course, government is national security is really another level,

1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:27.200
 it's human lives at stake, but let's start at the lighter case of just releasing some of the

1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:33.520
 awesome insights of how the sausage is made, the technology and being transparent about it

1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:43.200
 because it excites people. Like you said, it connects people. It inspires them. It's good

1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:48.320
 for the brand. It's good for everybody. I honestly think this kind of idea that people will steal

1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:56.400
 the information and we use it against you is an idea that's not true in this idea of the 20th

1:25:56.400 --> 1:26:02.480
 century. Like you said, some of the benefits of the social media, our social world is that

1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:07.040
 transparency is beneficial and I hope governments will learn that lesson. Of course,

1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:13.840
 they're usually the last to learn such lessons. What do you make of Bob Lazar's story in terms

1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:18.640
 of possession of aircraft? Do you believe him? I don't believe in the Bob Lazar story, to be

1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:28.000
 quite honest. I mean, Jeremy Corbell has done a great job interviewing him and has done some

1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:41.920
 beautiful documentaries. I don't know how to interpret it. Again, there's some of the people

1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:49.920
 who I fraternize with think it's all rubbish. Maybe he's right, but I don't know. I mean,

1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:57.040
 the problem is, and this is a little bit different about how I approach the whole area than a lot

1:26:57.040 --> 1:27:04.800
 of others, I'm less interested in going over old paperwork and all these old histories of who said

1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:14.000
 what the whole he said, she said of the history of UFOs. I'm a scientist. I worked on the brain

1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:19.920
 area because it's something I can collect data on. I can go back to the same individual,

1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:25.360
 collect an MRI again, and redo it. I can hand that MRI to somebody else. They can analyze it.

1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:30.640
 I can get materials. I can analyze them. I can get some of these skeletons. I won't touch any

1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:35.600
 skeletons ever again, but I can analyze it and somebody else can reproduce the data. I mean,

1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:42.880
 that's what I'm good at. I'm not going to go into the whole, I'm not a historian.

1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:51.360
 Yeah, that's true, but there's a human side to it. Sometimes I think with these, because again,

1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:58.320
 anomalous, rare events, some of the data is inextricably connected to humans, the observations.

1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:07.600
 Right. I mean, I hope in the future that sensory data will not be polluted by human

1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:13.920
 subjectivity, but that's still powerful data, even direct observations, like if you talk

1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:18.800
 about pilots. It's an interesting question to me whether Bob Azar is telling the truth,

1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:26.560
 whether he believes he's telling the truth too, and also what impact his story and stories like

1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:34.480
 his have on the willingness of governments to be transparent and so on. You have to credit

1:28:34.480 --> 1:28:40.800
 his story for captivating the imagination of people and getting the conversation going.

1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:45.600
 He's maintained his story for all these years with little to no change that I'm aware of.

1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:51.360
 But there's so many other people who are, let's say, experts in that story.

1:28:51.360 --> 1:29:01.600
 They're gut, you accumulate a set of circumstantial evidence where your

1:29:01.600 --> 1:29:05.360
 gut will say that somebody is not telling the truth. Yeah.

1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:14.800
 You mentioned Avi Loeb. I forgot to ask you about Omomua. Because you've analyzed specimens

1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:19.760
 here on earth, what do you make of that one? And what do you make broadly of our efforts

1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:27.920
 to look at rocks, essentially, or look at objects flying around in our solar system?

1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:34.480
 Is that a valuable pursuit, or maybe most of the fascinating things could be

1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:37.040
 discovered here on earth or on other nearby planets?

1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:46.880
 Just going to Omomua, I think Avi's insight is an interesting speculation, right?

1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:52.000
 Like I was saying before, people can sometimes look at something and not see it for what it is.

1:29:53.520 --> 1:29:57.360
 Many would just look at that and say, oh, it's an asteroid and dismiss it.

1:29:57.920 --> 1:30:03.440
 There was something odd about the data that Avi picked up on and said, well, here's an

1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:09.040
 alternative explanation that actually better fits the models than it just being a rock.

1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:17.360
 And to his credit, he just has ignored the critics because he believes the data is real

1:30:17.360 --> 1:30:23.520
 and is using that then as a battering ram to go after other things. So I think that's great.

1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:31.680
 Yeah. What is his main conclusion? Does he say it could be of alien extraterrestrial origin?

1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:36.000
 Well, that's one of the things. I mean, he's explained how it could be a light sail.

1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:44.240
 And a light sail is certainly within near human capabilities to make such a thing.

1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:50.400
 I think Yuri Milner, he's a Russian billionaire. He's involved, I think,

1:30:50.400 --> 1:31:00.000
 in a project to make light sails with laser, to launch them with laser power, essentially,

1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:09.440
 towards Alpha Centauri. So it's something that humans could make. I think Avi's proposal is

1:31:09.440 --> 1:31:15.760
 perfectly within the realm of possibility. Sadly, the thing is now nearly out of our solar system.

1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:22.240
 Yes. I mean, to me, that's inspiring to do greater levels of data collection in our solar system,

1:31:22.240 --> 1:31:27.440
 but also here on Earth. It just seems like we should be constantly collecting data because

1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:31.440
 the tools of software that we're developing get better and better at dealing with huge amounts

1:31:31.440 --> 1:31:36.240
 of data. It's changing the nature of science. I mean, collect all of the data.

1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:41.920
 Right. Collect the data. I mean, the Galileo project asked me over the weekend to join,

1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:47.120
 and I did. So I'm not a specialist in any of the stuff that they're doing,

1:31:48.400 --> 1:31:54.400
 but in looking at the list of people who are on there, there are really no biologists on there.

1:31:54.400 --> 1:31:58.800
 So at some point, if my expertise is required for something.

1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:01.280
 What's the goal and the vision of the Galileo project?

1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:05.280
 Better talk to Avi, but my understanding and just actually looking at the

1:32:06.800 --> 1:32:13.760
 the bylaws this morning, literally just got them, is number one, collect the data on UAP,

1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:22.000
 and number two, collect data on local, potentially local technological artifacts.

1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:26.800
 I need to look into this. This is fascinating. And Avi is heading the Galileo project.

1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:30.880
 Yeah. Have you spoken to him on this podcast? Yes. That was before, I believe,

1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:35.920
 is before he was headed. It's a new creation. Yeah. The Galileo project was, I think it's

1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:40.800
 about six or seven months old now. That's amazing. And he's getting a group of scientists together.

1:32:40.800 --> 1:32:46.480
 Oh yeah. About a hundred. Oh, it's actually, I am, I was looking at some of their stuff over the

1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:50.880
 weekend. I'm shocked at the level of organization that they've already got put together. That's

1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:56.000
 amazing. It looks like a moonshot project. I mean, I've been involved with a lot of NIH,

1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:02.880
 large NIH projects, which involve a lot of people in coordination, and they're putting it together.

1:33:05.920 --> 1:33:15.040
 So you're extremely well published in a lot of the fields we began this conversation with.

1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:23.440
 So you're legit scientists. But yet you're keeping an open mind to a lot of ideas that

1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:34.560
 maybe require you to take a leap outside of the conventional. So what advice would you give to

1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:44.400
 young people today that are in high school or in college that are dreaming of having impact in

1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:49.920
 science or maybe in whatever career path that goes outside of the conventional that really

1:33:51.600 --> 1:33:56.880
 does something new? If you believe in something, you believe that an idea is

1:33:58.880 --> 1:34:05.280
 valuable, or you have an approach to something, don't let others shame you into not doing it.

1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:13.120
 But as I've said, shame is a societal control device to get other people to do what they want

1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:18.560
 you to do rather than what you want to do. So shame sometimes is good to stop you from

1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:25.920
 doing something unethical or wrong. But shame also is something that is circumscribing your

1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:30.480
 environment. I've never let people who've told me, you know, you shouldn't do that

1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:35.600
 line of science, you should be ashamed of yourself for even thinking that, give me a break.

1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:42.400
 I'm, you know, why is it wrong to ask questions about this area? What's wrong with asking the

1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:49.040
 question? Frankly, you're the person who's wrong for trying to stop these questions. You're the

1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:56.160
 person who's almost acting like a cultist. You basically have closed your mind to what the

1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:01.760
 possibilities are. And if I'm not hurting anybody, and if it could lead to an advance, and if it's

1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:08.080
 my time, why does it bother you? I mean, I had a very well known scientist once tell me that I

1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:12.960
 was going to hurt my career talking about this. If anything, it's enhanced my career.

1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:17.440
 I have a couple of questions on this. So first of all, just a small comment on that.

1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:25.200
 I've realized that it feels like a lot of the progress in science is done by people pursuing

1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:31.840
 an idea that another senior faculty would probably say, this is going to hurt your career. I think

1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:38.720
 it's actually a pretty good indicator that there's something interesting when a senior wise person

1:35:38.720 --> 1:35:43.840
 tells you this is going to hurt your career. I think that's just the one, as a small, if I were

1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:47.680
 to give advice to young people, if somebody's senior tells you this is going to hurt your career,

1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:53.120
 think twice about taking their advice. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the primary thing.

1:35:53.120 --> 1:36:00.480
 And the other I tell my own students, I have a lab of about 20, 30 people and has been that big

1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:12.000
 since 1992, people come and go, is it's not the data that falls in line that's so interesting.

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:22.880
 It's the spot off the graph that you want to understand. When something is way off the graph,

1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:29.520
 that's the interesting thing because that's usually where discovery is. And the number of times that

1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:34.400
 I've stopped people in my lab and said, wait a second, go back a few slides. What was that?

1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:42.800
 And then it ended up being something interesting that made their careers. I could count on a few

1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:50.560
 hands. Yeah, get excited by the extraordinary that's outside of the thing that you've done in

1:36:50.560 --> 1:37:01.760
 the past. Just on a personal psychological level, is there, I'm sure at Stanford, I'm sure in you

1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:09.840
 exploring some of these ideas, there's pressure. How do you not give in to the pressure? How do

1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:19.360
 you not give in to the people that push you away from these topics? What would you say shame?

1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:25.600
 I just point to my successes. I say, you're the ones who told me not to start companies

1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:31.520
 all this time ago. And now you're the one coming to me for advice for how to start a company.

1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:42.720
 Yeah. Right. But from the scientific area, it's you're wanting to take something off the table

1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:52.000
 that might be an explanation. How is that the scientific method? I reverse shame them.

1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:57.120
 Reverse shame them. So purely with reason through conversation, you're able to do that. So it doesn't

1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:02.080
 feel, because to me, it would just feel lonely. There's a community. There's a community of

1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:09.360
 science. And when you're working on something that's outside a particular conventional way

1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:15.440
 of thinking, it could be lonely. I mean, there's in the AI field, if you were working on neural

1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:21.760
 networks in the 90s, it could be lonely. I have met some of the most fascinating people ever that

1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:29.360
 had I stayed the conventional track, I would never have met. I mean, truly brilliant people

1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:38.240
 because of this. So it is for those worried about, well, should I step outside of my

1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:44.880
 comfort zone, you're going to meet some really interesting people. And because I'm open about

1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:54.240
 this area, I'll go and give a talk in Boston, Harvard or MIT. And at dinner, inevitably,

1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:00.240
 this subject comes up. And inevitably, somebody else at the table will admit

1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:04.320
 both that they're interested or that they've seen something. And suddenly, the whole tone

1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:11.440
 of the conversation changes. It's kind of like there's safety in numbers. And then,

1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:17.520
 or I've had people come to me afterwards after dinner and say, hey, I don't talk about this

1:39:17.520 --> 1:39:25.040
 openly. But so the number of scientists who know that there's something else going on

1:39:25.920 --> 1:39:31.120
 is much larger than the scientific community would like to think.

1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:39.040
 That's a really powerful one, which is I don't talk about this openly. But here's what I believe.

1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:45.360
 And you'd be surprised how many people speak like this and hold those beliefs. And I am optimistic

1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:50.960
 about social media in a more connected world to reveal more and more, like us not to have these

1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:56.800
 two personalities. We're like this public and private one. We've mentioned the big questions

1:39:56.800 --> 1:40:01.280
 of the origins of the universe. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:08.640
 For us humans, our human existence here on Earth, or just at the individual level of a human life,

1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:12.160
 what, Gary, is the meaning of life?

1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:24.480
 I think that what we're going through today with this realization, it's kind of like you've lived on

1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:31.680
 an island, your whole life, and you've looked across the ocean and you've never imagined

1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:37.840
 there was another island with anybody else on it. And then suddenly a ship with sails shows up.

1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:44.400
 You don't understand it, but you realize that suddenly your world just got a lot bigger.

1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:52.160
 I think we're in one of those moments right now that our world view, our galactic view,

1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:57.360
 our galactic view is opening to something a little bit bigger. And not just that there might be

1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:06.000
 somebody else, but that there's something else. And what it is is yet to be understood.

1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:14.000
 And the fact that it isn't understood to me is what's exciting because I can fill it with my

1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:25.360
 dreams. And this discovery, our world might, is about to get a lot more humbling and a lot

1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:31.280
 more fascinating once we look out and realize we were on an island all along. It makes us both

1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:40.240
 smaller but larger at the same time to me. I can look outside at the stars and think

1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:45.840
 and imagine what else might be out there. And although I know that I will never see it all,

1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:48.240
 it excites me to know that it's there.

1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:56.400
 Well, Gary, both to respect your time and also because at 12 I turned into a princess.

1:41:58.480 --> 1:42:05.680
 Let me just say thank you for doing everything you're doing as a great scientist, as a person

1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:10.800
 willing to reject the conventional. And thank you for spending your extremely valuable time with

1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:15.680
 me today. Thanks for talking. Thanks so much. It was great talking. Thanks for listening to this

1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:20.160
 conversation with Gary Nolan. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the

1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:28.560
 description. And now let me leave you some words from Stanislav Lem in Solaris. How do you expect

1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:35.840
 to communicate with the ocean when we can't even understand one another? Thanks for listening and

1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:59.440
 hope to see you next time.
