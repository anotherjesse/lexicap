00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
 The following is a conversation with Daniel Schmacktenberger, a founding member of the

00:04.320 --> 00:08.720
 Consilience Project that is aimed at improving public sense making and dialogue.

00:09.280 --> 00:15.360
 He's interested in understanding how we humans can be the best version of ourselves as individuals

00:15.360 --> 00:17.840
 and as collectives at all scales.

00:18.720 --> 00:25.760
 Quick mention of our sponsors Groud News, Netsuite, FourSigmatic, MagixBoon, and BetterHelp.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.400
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:28.400 --> 00:33.920
 As a side note, let me say that I got a chance to talk to Daniel on and off the mic for a couple

00:33.920 --> 00:39.040
 of days. We took a long walk the day before our conversation. I really enjoyed meeting him,

00:39.040 --> 00:44.560
 just on a basic human level. We talked about the world around us with words that carried hope

00:44.560 --> 00:50.880
 for us individual ants actually contributing something of value to the colony. These conversations

00:50.880 --> 00:56.480
 are the reasons I love human beings, our insatiable striving to lessen the suffering in the world.

00:56.480 --> 01:01.520
 But more than that, there's a simple magic to two strangers meeting for the first time

01:01.520 --> 01:06.400
 and sharing ideas, becoming fast friends and creating something that is far greater than

01:06.400 --> 01:11.040
 the sum of our parts. I've gotten to experience some of that same magic here in Austin with

01:11.040 --> 01:15.200
 a few new friends and in random bars in my travels across this country.

01:15.920 --> 01:20.880
 Where a conversation leaves me with a big stupid smile on my face and a new appreciation

01:20.880 --> 01:27.120
 of this too short, too beautiful life. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my

01:27.120 --> 01:34.240
 conversation with Daniel Schmacktenberger. If aliens were observing Earth through the

01:34.240 --> 01:40.080
 entire history just watching us and we're tasked with summarizing what happened until now,

01:40.080 --> 01:43.680
 what do you think they would say? What do you think they would write up in that summary?

01:43.680 --> 01:50.800
 Like it has to be pretty short, less than a page. Like in The Hitchhiker's Guide, there's I think

01:50.800 --> 01:56.640
 like a paragraph or a couple sentences. How would you summarize, sorry, how would the alien

01:56.640 --> 02:03.280
 summarize do you think all of human civilization? My first thoughts take more than a page.

02:04.240 --> 02:11.040
 They'd probably distill it. Because if they watched, well I mean first I have no idea if

02:11.040 --> 02:15.600
 their senses are even attuned to similar stuff to what our senses are attuned to or what the

02:15.600 --> 02:20.400
 nature of their consciousness is like relative to ours and so let's assume that they're kind of

02:20.400 --> 02:24.320
 like us just technologically more advanced to get here from wherever they are. That's the first

02:24.320 --> 02:28.880
 kind of constraint on the thought experiment. And then if they've watched throughout all of history

02:30.720 --> 02:37.120
 they saw the burning of Alexandria. They saw that 2000 years ago in Greece we were producing

02:37.120 --> 02:41.840
 things like clocks, the antikytheria mechanism and then that technology got lost. They saw that

02:41.840 --> 02:47.600
 there wasn't just a steady dialectic of progress. So every once in a while there's a giant fire

02:47.600 --> 02:54.160
 that destroys a lot of things. There's a giant like commotion that destroys a lot of things.

02:54.160 --> 03:03.360
 Yeah and it's usually self induced. They would have seen that. And so as they're looking at us

03:03.360 --> 03:10.480
 now as we move past the nuclear weapons age into the full globalization anthropocene exponential

03:10.480 --> 03:18.240
 tech age still making our decisions relatively similarly to how we did in the Stone Age as

03:18.240 --> 03:23.440
 far as rivalry game theory type stuff. I think they would think that this is probably most likely

03:23.440 --> 03:27.040
 one of the planets that is not going to make it to being intergalactic because we blow ourselves

03:27.040 --> 03:34.720
 up in the technological adolescence. And if we are going to we're going to need some major progress

03:34.720 --> 03:42.000
 rapidly in the social technologies that can guide and bind and direct the physical technologies

03:42.560 --> 03:45.200
 so that we are safe vessels for the amount of power we're getting.

03:47.760 --> 03:53.920
 Actually Hitchhiker's Guide has an estimation about how much of a risk this particular thing

03:53.920 --> 04:01.280
 poses to the rest of the galaxy. And I think I forget what it was. I think it was medium or low.

04:02.320 --> 04:10.080
 So their estimation would be that this species of ant like creatures is not going to survive long.

04:10.080 --> 04:15.120
 There's ups and downs in terms of technological innovation. The fundamental nature of their

04:15.120 --> 04:20.480
 behavior from a game theory perspective hasn't really changed. They have not learned in any

04:20.480 --> 04:28.480
 fundamental way how to control and properly incentivize or properly do the mechanism design

04:29.200 --> 04:35.840
 of games to ensure long term survival. And then they move on to another planet. Do you

04:37.200 --> 04:42.320
 think there is in a more slightly more serious question do you think there's

04:42.320 --> 04:49.760
 some number or perhaps a very very large number of intelligent alien civilizations out there?

04:51.120 --> 04:57.600
 Yes. It would be hard to think otherwise. I know I think Posterum had a new article not that long

04:57.600 --> 05:02.560
 ago on why that might not be the case. That the Drake equation might not be the kind of in

05:02.560 --> 05:08.880
 story on it. But when I look at the total number of Kepler planets just that we're aware of just

05:08.880 --> 05:16.080
 galactically and also when those life forms were discovered in Mono Lake that didn't have the same

05:16.080 --> 05:20.800
 six primary atoms that I think it had arsenic replacing phosphorus as one of the primary

05:20.800 --> 05:25.440
 aspects of its energy metabolism, we get to think about that the building blocks might be

05:25.440 --> 05:29.280
 more different. So the physical constraints even that the planets have to have might be more different.

05:30.560 --> 05:36.880
 It seems really unlikely not to mention interesting things that we've observed that

05:36.880 --> 05:43.280
 are still unexplained as you've had guests on your show discussing tic tac and oh the ones that

05:43.280 --> 05:50.560
 have visited. Yeah. Well let's dive right into that. What do you make sense of the rich human

05:50.560 --> 05:59.040
 psychology of there being hundreds of thousands probably millions of witnesses of UFOs of different

05:59.040 --> 06:05.280
 kinds on earth most of which I presume are conjured out by the human mind through the

06:05.280 --> 06:12.080
 perception system. Some number might be true some number might be reflective of actual physical

06:12.080 --> 06:19.360
 objects whether it's you know drones or testing military technology that's secret or otherworldly

06:19.360 --> 06:24.640
 technology. What do you make sense of all that because it's gaining quite a bit of popularity

06:24.640 --> 06:36.960
 recently. There is some sense of which that's us humans being hopeful and dreaming of otherworldly

06:36.960 --> 06:45.600
 creatures as a way to escape the dreariness of our of the human condition. But in another sense it

06:45.600 --> 06:52.720
 could be it really could be something truly exciting that science should turn its eye towards.

06:52.720 --> 06:58.640
 So what do you where do you place it. Speaking of turning eye towards this is one of those

06:58.640 --> 07:04.720
 super fascinating actually super consequential possibly topics that I wish I had more time

07:04.720 --> 07:08.480
 to study and just haven't allocated. So I don't have firm beliefs on this because I haven't got

07:08.480 --> 07:11.760
 to study it as much as I want. So what I'm going to say comes from a superficial assessment.

07:15.200 --> 07:20.400
 While we know there are plenty of things that people thought of as UFO sightings that we can

07:20.400 --> 07:25.440
 fully write off we have other better explanations for them. What we're interested in is the ones

07:25.440 --> 07:28.800
 that we don't have better explanations for and then not just immediately jumping to

07:30.320 --> 07:35.200
 a theory of what it is but holding it as unidentified and being being curious and earnest.

07:36.400 --> 07:42.240
 I think the the tic tac one is quite interesting and made it in major media recently but

07:42.880 --> 07:45.120
 I don't know if you ever saw the disclosure project.

07:45.120 --> 07:53.280
 A guy named Steven Greer organized a bunch of mostly US military and some commercial flight.

07:55.200 --> 08:01.200
 People who had direct observation and classified information disclosing it at a CNN briefing.

08:01.840 --> 08:07.520
 And so you saw high ranking generals admirals fighter pilots all describing things that they

08:07.520 --> 08:17.360
 saw on radar with visual with their own eyes or cameras and also describing some phenomena that

08:17.360 --> 08:23.680
 had some consistency across different people. And I find this interesting enough that I think it

08:23.680 --> 08:30.720
 would be silly to just dismiss it. And specifically like we can we can ask the question how much of

08:30.720 --> 08:35.200
 it is natural phenomena ball lightning or something like that. And this is why I'm more

08:35.200 --> 08:40.160
 interested in what fighter pilots and astronauts and people who are trained in

08:42.800 --> 08:49.520
 being able to identify flying objects and atmospheric phenomena have to say about it.

08:51.440 --> 08:56.320
 I think the thing then you could say well are they more advanced military craft.

08:57.040 --> 09:02.400
 Is it some kind of you know human craft. The interesting thing that a number of them describe

09:02.400 --> 09:08.560
 is something that's kind of like right angles at speed or not right angles acute angles at speed

09:08.560 --> 09:12.320
 but something that looks like a different relationship to inertia than physics makes

09:12.320 --> 09:18.480
 sense for us. I don't think that there are any human technologies that are doing that even in

09:18.480 --> 09:24.720
 really deep underground black projects. Now one could say OK well could it be a hologram.

09:25.520 --> 09:31.200
 What would it show up on radar radar is also seeing it. And so I don't know I think there's

09:31.200 --> 09:38.560
 enough I mean and for that to be a massive coordinated PSYOP is it as interesting and

09:39.120 --> 09:46.880
 ridiculous in a way as the idea that it's UFOs from some extra planetary source. So it's up

09:46.880 --> 09:54.640
 there on the interesting topics. To me there is if it is at all alien technology it is the dumbest

09:54.640 --> 10:01.840
 version of alien technology. It's so far away it's like the old old crappy VHS tapes of alien

10:01.840 --> 10:07.600
 technology. These are like crappy drones that just floated or even like space to the level of

10:07.600 --> 10:15.520
 like space junk because it is so close to our human technology. We talk about it moves in ways

10:15.520 --> 10:22.240
 that's that's unlike what we understand about physics but it still has very similar kind of

10:22.240 --> 10:28.080
 geometric notions and something that we humans can perceive with our eyes all those kinds of

10:28.080 --> 10:34.640
 things. I feel like alien technology most likely would be something that we would not be able to

10:34.640 --> 10:42.240
 perceive not because they're hiding but because it's so far advanced that it would be much it

10:42.240 --> 10:48.240
 would be beyond the cognitive capabilities of us humans just as you were saying as per your answer

10:48.240 --> 10:55.600
 for alien summarizing earth it's the starting assumption is they have similar perception

10:55.600 --> 11:02.480
 systems they have similar cognitive capabilities and that very well may not be the case. Let me ask

11:02.480 --> 11:09.040
 you about staying in aliens for just a little longer because I think it's a good transition

11:09.040 --> 11:19.520
 in talking about governments and human societies. Do you think if a US government or any government

11:20.160 --> 11:28.720
 was in possession of an alien spacecraft or of information related to alien spacecraft they would

11:28.720 --> 11:41.120
 have the capacity structurally would they have the the processes would they be able to

11:43.600 --> 11:48.320
 communicate that to the public effectively or would they keep it secret in a room and do nothing

11:48.320 --> 11:54.720
 with it both of to try to preserve military secrets but also because of the incompetence

11:54.720 --> 12:05.280
 that's inherent to bureaucracies or either? Well we can certainly see when certain things become

12:05.280 --> 12:11.440
 declassified 25 or 50 years later that there were things that the public might have wanted to know

12:11.440 --> 12:17.920
 that were kept secret for a very long time for reasons of at least supposedly national security

12:17.920 --> 12:25.600
 which is also a nice source of plausible deniability for people covering their

12:25.600 --> 12:30.240
 ass for doing things that would be problematic and other purposes.

12:34.000 --> 12:42.560
 There are there's a scientist at Stanford who supposedly got some material that was

12:42.560 --> 12:48.800
 recovered from Area 51 type area did analysis on it using I believe electron microscopy and a

12:48.800 --> 12:56.800
 couple other methods and came to the idea that it was a nanotech alloy that was something we

12:56.800 --> 13:02.960
 didn't currently have the ability to do was not naturally occurring. I've heard some things and

13:02.960 --> 13:06.640
 again like I said I'm not going to stand behind any of these because I haven't done the level of

13:06.640 --> 13:16.240
 study to have high confidence. I think what you said also about would it be super low tech alien

13:17.520 --> 13:23.440
 craft like would they necessarily move their atoms around in space or might they do something

13:23.440 --> 13:28.480
 more interesting than that might they be able to have a different relationship to the concept of

13:28.480 --> 13:35.280
 space or information or consciousness or one of the things that the craft supposedly do is not

13:35.280 --> 13:41.200
 only accelerate and turn in a way that looks not inertial but also disappear. So there's a question

13:41.200 --> 13:47.120
 as to like the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive and it could be possible to some people

13:47.120 --> 13:53.520
 run a hypothesis that they create intentional amounts of exposure as an invitation of a particular

13:53.520 --> 14:02.640
 kind. Who knows interesting field. We tend to assume like SETI that's listening up for aliens out

14:02.640 --> 14:08.560
 there. I've just been recently reading more and more about gravitational waves and you have

14:10.400 --> 14:16.640
 orbiting black holes that orbit each other. They generate ripples in space time

14:18.720 --> 14:23.200
 on my uh for fun at night when I lay in bed I think about what it would be like to ride those

14:23.200 --> 14:29.040
 waves when they not not the low magnitude they are as that when they reach earth but get closer

14:29.040 --> 14:34.800
 to the black holes because they'll basically be shrinking and expanding us in all dimensions

14:35.840 --> 14:41.760
 including time so it's actually ripples through space time that they generate.

14:42.800 --> 14:47.600
 Why is it that you couldn't use that it's travels at speed of light.

14:50.560 --> 14:57.120
 It travels at speed which a very weird thing to say when you're when you're uh morphing space time

14:57.120 --> 15:03.760
 it's it's it's you could argue it's faster than the speed of light so if you are able to communicate

15:03.760 --> 15:11.040
 by to summon enough energy to generate black holes and to orbit the uh to to force them to

15:11.040 --> 15:19.440
 orbit each other why not travel as the ripples in space time whatever the hell that means

15:19.440 --> 15:24.720
 somehow combined with wormholes so if you're able to communicate through like we don't think of uh

15:24.720 --> 15:30.720
 uh gravitational waves as something you can communicate with because the the radio will

15:30.720 --> 15:37.840
 be have to be the very large size of very dense but perhaps that's it you know perhaps that's one

15:37.840 --> 15:45.520
 way to communicate it's a very effective way and uh that would explain like we wouldn't even be able

15:45.520 --> 15:52.000
 to make sense of that of the physics that results in an alien species that's able to control gravity

15:52.000 --> 15:57.760
 at that scale i think you just jumped up the Kardashev scale so far so you're not just harnessing

15:57.760 --> 16:06.400
 the power of a star but harnessing the power of mutually rotating black holes um i i that's way

16:06.400 --> 16:14.320
 above my physics pay grade to think about including even uh non rotating black hole versions of

16:14.320 --> 16:22.320
 trans warp travel um i think uh you know you can talk with Eric more about that i think he has better

16:22.320 --> 16:29.200
 ideas on it than i do my hope for the future of humanity mostly does not rest in the near term

16:29.200 --> 16:35.200
 on our ability to get to other habitable planets in time and even more than that in the list of

16:35.200 --> 16:41.040
 possible solutions of uh how to improve human civilization uh orbiting black holes is not in

16:41.040 --> 16:46.800
 on the first page for you and not on the first page okay i bet you did not expect us to start

16:46.800 --> 16:56.080
 this competition here but i'm glad the places it went i am excited under my smallest scale of uh

16:56.800 --> 17:06.160
 mars europe or titan venus potentially having very like bacteria like life forms just on a

17:06.160 --> 17:14.240
 on a small human level it's a little bit scary but mostly really exciting that there might be life

17:14.240 --> 17:23.040
 elsewhere in the volcanoes and the oceans all around us teaming having little societies and

17:23.760 --> 17:28.560
 whether there's properties about that kind of life that's somehow different than ours i don't know

17:28.560 --> 17:35.840
 what would be more exciting if those colonies of single cell type organisms what would be more

17:35.840 --> 17:44.000
 exciting if they're different or they're the same if they're the same that means through the rest of

17:44.000 --> 17:53.040
 the universe there's life forms like us something like us everywhere if they're different that's also

17:53.040 --> 18:00.800
 really exciting because there's life forms everywhere they're not like us that's a little bit

18:00.800 --> 18:08.560
 scary i don't know what's scary actually i think both scary and exciting no matter what right the

18:08.560 --> 18:11.680
 idea that they could be very different and philosophically very interesting for us to

18:11.680 --> 18:17.840
 open our aperture on what life and consciousness and and self replicating possibilities could look like

18:19.520 --> 18:22.880
 the question on are they different or the same obviously there's lots of life here that is

18:23.440 --> 18:28.720
 the same in some ways in different in other ways um when you take the thing that we call an invasive

18:28.720 --> 18:34.480
 species is something that's still pretty the same hydrocarbon based thing but co evolved with

18:34.480 --> 18:37.600
 co selective pressures in a certain environment we move it to another environment it might be

18:37.600 --> 18:42.400
 devastating to that whole ecosystem because it's just different enough that it messes up the self

18:42.400 --> 18:50.880
 stabilizing dynamics of that ecosystem so the question of are they would they be different in

18:50.880 --> 18:56.400
 ways where we could still figure out a way to inhabit a biosphere together or fundamentally

18:56.400 --> 19:02.400
 not fundamentally the nature of how they operate and the nature of how we operate would be

19:02.400 --> 19:10.640
 incommensurable is a deep question well we offline talked about memetic theory right it seems like

19:10.640 --> 19:16.400
 if there were sufficiently different where we would not even we can coexist on different planes

19:17.440 --> 19:23.600
 it seems like a good thing if we're close enough together to where we'd be competing then it's

19:23.600 --> 19:27.920
 you're getting into the world of viruses and pathogens and all those kinds of things to where

19:27.920 --> 19:37.840
 we would uh one of us would die off quickly through basically mass murder without even even

19:37.840 --> 19:43.360
 accidentally even accidentally if we just had a self replicating single celled kind of creature

19:43.920 --> 19:52.160
 that happened to not work well for the hydrocarbon life that was here that got introduced because

19:52.160 --> 19:56.720
 it either output something that was toxic or utilized up the same resource too quickly and it

19:56.720 --> 20:04.480
 just replicated faster mutated faster it wouldn't be a um memetic theory conflict theory kind of

20:04.480 --> 20:11.200
 harm it would just be uh a von Neumann machine a self replicating machine that was fundamentally

20:11.200 --> 20:17.120
 incompatible with these kinds of self replicating systems with faster ootaloops for one final time

20:17.120 --> 20:25.840
 putting your alien flash god hat on and you look at human civilization the do you think about the

20:25.840 --> 20:32.720
 7.8 billion people on earth as individual little creatures individual little organisms or do you

20:32.720 --> 20:43.120
 think of us as uh one organism with a collective intelligence what's the proper framework through

20:43.120 --> 20:48.320
 which to analyze it again as an alien so that i know where you're coming from would you have asked

20:48.320 --> 20:53.120
 the question the same way before the industrial revolution before the agricultural revolution

20:53.120 --> 20:56.000
 when there were half a billion people and no telecommunications connecting them

20:59.120 --> 21:03.360
 i would indeed ask the question the same way but i would be less confident about

21:05.200 --> 21:11.360
 about your conclusions um it would be an actually more interesting way to ask the

21:11.360 --> 21:16.160
 question at that time but i was nevertheless asked it the same way yes well let's go back

21:16.160 --> 21:21.360
 further and smaller than uh rather than just a single human or the entire human species let's

21:21.360 --> 21:30.560
 look at uh in a relatively isolated tribe yes in the relatively isolated probably sub dunmar

21:30.560 --> 21:38.480
 number sub kind of 150 people tribe do i look at that as one entity where evolution is selecting

21:38.480 --> 21:44.400
 for based on group selection or do i think of it as 150 individuals um that are interacting in some

21:44.400 --> 21:55.840
 way well could those individuals exist without the group no uh the evolutionary adaptiveness of humans

21:57.120 --> 22:03.280
 was involved critically group selection and individual humans alone trying to figure out

22:03.280 --> 22:10.880
 stone tools and protection and whatever uh aren't what was selected for and so i think the or is

22:10.880 --> 22:20.000
 the wrong frame i think it's individuals are affecting the group that they're a part of

22:20.000 --> 22:23.760
 they're also dependent upon and being affected by the group that they're part of

22:24.800 --> 22:30.400
 and so this now starts to get in deep into political theories also which is theories

22:30.400 --> 22:34.880
 that orient towards the collective at different scales whether a tribal scale or an empire or

22:34.880 --> 22:39.040
 nation state or something and ones that orient towards the individual liberalism and stuff like

22:39.040 --> 22:44.560
 that and i think there's very obvious failure modes on both sides and so the relationship

22:44.560 --> 22:48.000
 between them is more interesting to me than either of them the relationship between the

22:48.000 --> 22:51.680
 individual and the collective and the question around how to have a virtuous process between

22:51.680 --> 22:56.720
 those so a good social system would be one where the organism of the individual and the organism

22:56.720 --> 23:02.480
 of the group of individuals is they're both synergistic to each other so what is best for

23:02.480 --> 23:07.920
 the individuals and what's best for the whole is aligned but there is nevertheless an individual

23:08.720 --> 23:16.480
 they're not it's uh it's a matter of degrees i suppose but what is uh what defines a human

23:17.280 --> 23:25.840
 more the the social network within the which they've been brought up through which they've

23:25.840 --> 23:30.480
 developed their intelligence or is it their own sovereign individual self

23:32.480 --> 23:39.920
 like what's your intuition of how much not just for evolutionary survival but as intellectual

23:39.920 --> 23:47.040
 beings how much do we need others for our development yeah i think we have a weird sense

23:47.040 --> 23:55.040
 of this today relative to most previous periods of sapient history i think the vast majority

23:55.040 --> 24:00.960
 of sapient history is tribal like depending upon your early human model two or three hundred

24:00.960 --> 24:07.600
 thousand years of homo sapiens in the little tribes where they depended upon that tribe for

24:07.600 --> 24:15.200
 survival and excommunication from the tribe was was fatal i think they and our whole evolutionary

24:15.200 --> 24:19.280
 genetic history is in that environment and the amount of time we've been out of it is is relatively

24:19.280 --> 24:26.720
 so tiny and then we still depended upon extended families and local communities more and the big

24:26.720 --> 24:33.200
 kind of giant market complex where i can provide something to the market to get money to be able

24:33.200 --> 24:36.320
 to get other things from the market where it seems like i don't need anyone it's almost like

24:36.320 --> 24:42.960
 disintermediating our sense of need even though even though you're in my ability to talk to each

24:42.960 --> 24:47.200
 other using these mics and the phones that we coordinated on took millions of people over

24:47.200 --> 24:50.880
 six continents to be able to run the supply chains it made all the stuff that we depend on but we

24:50.880 --> 24:58.320
 don't notice that we depend upon them they all seem fungible um if you take a baby obviously

24:58.320 --> 25:02.400
 that you didn't even get to a baby without a mom was it dependent we depend upon each other right

25:02.400 --> 25:07.040
 without two two parents at minimum and they depended upon other people but if we take that

25:07.040 --> 25:13.040
 baby and we put it out in the wild it obviously dies so if we let it grow up for a little while

25:13.040 --> 25:16.400
 the minimum amount of time where it starts to have some autonomy and then we put it out in the

25:16.400 --> 25:24.480
 wild and there this has happened a few times it doesn't learn language and it doesn't learn the

25:24.480 --> 25:30.960
 articulation the small motor articulation that we learn it doesn't learn the type of consciousness

25:30.960 --> 25:37.840
 that we end up having that is socialized so i think i think we take for granted how much

25:37.840 --> 25:48.800
 conditioning affects us um is it possible that uh it affects basically 99.9 or maybe the whole

25:48.800 --> 25:56.160
 thing the whole thing is the connection between us humans and there were no better than apes

25:56.160 --> 26:03.680
 without our human connections because that thinking of it that way forces us to think

26:03.680 --> 26:09.680
 very differently about human society and how to progress forward if the connections are fundamental

26:09.680 --> 26:14.640
 i just have to object to the no better than apes because better here i think you mean a specific

26:14.640 --> 26:18.320
 thing which means have capacities that are fundamentally different than i think apes also

26:18.320 --> 26:27.200
 depend upon troops um yes and i i think the idea of humans as better than nature in some kind of

26:27.920 --> 26:32.800
 ethical sense ends up having heaps of problems we'll table that we can come back to it but

26:32.800 --> 26:37.040
 when we say what is unique about homo sapien capacity relative to the other animals we currently

26:37.680 --> 26:42.320
 inhabit the biosphere with and i'm saying it that way because there were other early hominids

26:42.320 --> 26:50.160
 that had some of these capacities uh we believe our tool creation and our language creation and our

26:50.160 --> 26:56.480
 coordination are all kind of the results of a certain type of capacity for abstraction and

26:56.480 --> 27:00.320
 other animals will use tools but they don't evolve the tools they use they keep using the

27:00.320 --> 27:06.640
 same types of tools that they basically can find so a chimp will notice that a rock can cut a vine

27:06.640 --> 27:11.040
 that it wants to and it'll even notice that a sharper rock will cut it better and experientially

27:11.040 --> 27:14.640
 it'll use the sharper rock and if you even give it a knife it'll probably use the knife because

27:14.640 --> 27:20.320
 it's experiencing the effectiveness but it doesn't make stone tools because that requires

27:20.320 --> 27:25.760
 understanding why one is sharper than the other what is the abstract principle called sharpness

27:25.760 --> 27:31.360
 to then be able to invent a sharper thing that same abstraction makes language and the ability

27:31.360 --> 27:38.720
 for abstract representation which makes the ability to coordinate in a more advanced set of ways

27:38.720 --> 27:43.440
 so i do think our ability to coordinate with each other is pretty fundamental to the selection of

27:43.440 --> 27:50.000
 what we are as a species i wonder if that coordination that connection is actually the

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
 thing that gives birth to consciousness that gives birth to well let's start with self awareness more

27:56.000 --> 28:02.000
 like theory of mind theory of mind yeah you know i i suppose there's experiments that show that

28:02.000 --> 28:07.840
 there's other mammals that have a very crude theory of mind i'm not sure maybe dogs something like

28:07.840 --> 28:12.960
 that but actually dogs probably has to do with that they co evolved with humans see it'd be

28:12.960 --> 28:21.120
 interesting if that theory of mind is what leads to consciousness in the way we think about it is

28:21.120 --> 28:26.880
 the richness of the subjective experience that is consciousness i have a inkling sense that that

28:27.520 --> 28:33.680
 only exists because we're social creatures that that doesn't come uh with this with the

28:33.680 --> 28:40.400
 hardware and the software any in the beginning that's like uh that's learned as an effective

28:40.400 --> 28:47.200
 uh tool for communication almost like we we think we i think we think uh that consciousness is

28:47.200 --> 28:57.680
 fundamental and uh maybe it's not uh there's um a bunch of folks kind of criticize the idea that

28:57.680 --> 29:06.320
 the illusion of consciousness is consciousness that it is just a facade we use to to uh help us

29:06.320 --> 29:11.200
 construct theories of mind you almost put yourself in the world as a subjective being

29:11.840 --> 29:18.480
 in that experience you want to reach the experience as an individual person so that i could empathize

29:18.480 --> 29:24.960
 with your experience i find that notion compelling mostly because it allows you to then create robots

29:25.600 --> 29:33.280
 that become conscious not by being quote unquote conscious but by just learning to fake it till

29:33.280 --> 29:41.440
 they make it is uh creative you know present the facade of consciousness and with it with the task

29:41.440 --> 29:48.000
 of uh making that facade very convincing to us humans and thereby it will become conscious

29:48.000 --> 29:55.360
 have a sense in that in some way that will make them conscious if they're sufficiently convincing

29:55.360 --> 30:08.640
 to humans is there some element of that that you uh you find convincing this is a much harder set of

30:08.640 --> 30:15.760
 questions and deep end of the pool than starting with the aliens was um we went from aliens to

30:15.760 --> 30:24.000
 consciousness this is not the trajectory i was expecting nor you but let us walk a while we

30:24.000 --> 30:29.840
 we can walk a while and i don't think we will do it justice so what do we mean by consciousness

30:30.720 --> 30:37.360
 versus conscious self reflective awareness what do we mean by awareness qualia theory of

30:37.360 --> 30:44.720
 mind there's a lot of terms that we think of as slightly different things and um subjectivity

30:44.720 --> 30:52.640
 first person uh i i don't remember exactly the quote but i remember when reading when sam

30:52.640 --> 30:57.360
 Harris wrote the book free will and then denet critiqued it and then there was some writing

30:57.360 --> 31:04.000
 back and forth between the two because normally they're on the same side of kind of arguing

31:04.720 --> 31:10.000
 for critical thinking and logical fallacies and philosophy of science against um supernatural

31:10.000 --> 31:16.880
 ideas and here denet believed there is something like free will he is a determinist

31:16.880 --> 31:23.040
 compatibilist but no consciousness and radical limitivist and sam was saying no there is consciousness

31:23.040 --> 31:28.160
 but there's no free will and that's like the most fundamental kinds of axiomatic senses they

31:28.160 --> 31:30.800
 disagreed on but neither of them could say was because the other one didn't understand the

31:30.800 --> 31:35.440
 philosophy of science um or logical fallacies and and they kind of spoke past each other and at

31:35.440 --> 31:39.840
 the end if i remember correctly sam said something that i thought was quite insightful which was to

31:39.840 --> 31:44.960
 the effect of it seems to because they weren't making any progress and shared understanding

31:44.960 --> 31:51.440
 it seems that we simply have different intuitions about this and what you could see was that

31:52.400 --> 31:57.040
 what the words meant right at the level of symbol grounding might be quite different

31:59.120 --> 32:04.000
 one of them might have had deeply different enough life experiences that what is being referenced

32:04.000 --> 32:08.560
 and then also different associations of what the words mean this is why when trying to address

32:08.560 --> 32:13.600
 these things charles sanders per said the first philosophy has to be semiotics because if you

32:13.600 --> 32:18.160
 don't get semiotics right we end up importing different ideas and bad ideas right into the

32:18.160 --> 32:22.240
 nature of the language that we're using and then it's very hard to do epistemology or ontology

32:22.240 --> 32:28.000
 together uh so i'm saying this to say why i don't think we're going to get very far is i think

32:28.000 --> 32:33.280
 we would have to go very slowly in terms of defining what we mean by words and fundamental

32:33.280 --> 32:40.880
 concepts um well and also allowing our minds to drift together for time so there are definitions

32:40.880 --> 32:48.400
 of these terms aligned i think there's some there's a beauty that some people enjoy with sam

32:49.360 --> 32:58.160
 that he is quite stubborn on his definitions of terms without often clearly revealing that

32:58.160 --> 33:04.320
 definition so in his mind he can like he could sense that he can deeply understand what he means

33:04.320 --> 33:11.360
 exactly by a term like free will and consciousness and you're right he's very he's very specific in

33:11.360 --> 33:20.080
 fascinating ways that not only does he think that free will is an illusion he thinks he's able

33:20.080 --> 33:26.480
 not thinks he says he's able to just remove himself from the experience of free will and just be

33:26.480 --> 33:34.800
 like for minutes at a time hours at a time like really experiences if he has no free will

33:34.800 --> 33:44.080
 like he's a a leaf flowing down the river and given that he's very sure that consciousness

33:44.080 --> 33:50.160
 is fundamental so here's a this conscious leaf that's subjectively experiencing the floating

33:50.160 --> 33:57.280
 the floating and yet there's no ability to control and make any decisions for for itself it's only a

33:59.040 --> 34:05.120
 the decisions have all all been made there's some aspect to which the terminology there perhaps

34:05.120 --> 34:10.800
 is the problem so that's a particular kind of meditative experience and the people in the

34:10.800 --> 34:14.720
 vedantic tradition and some of the buddhist traditions thousands of years ago described

34:14.720 --> 34:21.680
 similar experiences and somewhat similar conclusions some slightly different there are other types of

34:21.680 --> 34:30.240
 phenomenal experience that are the phenomenal experience of pure agency and you know like the

34:30.240 --> 34:35.520
 the catholic theologian but evolutionary theorist tear de chardon describes this and

34:36.160 --> 34:40.640
 that rather than a creator agent god in the beginning there's a creative impulse or a creative

34:40.640 --> 34:45.200
 process and he was would go into a type of meditation that identified as the pure essence

34:45.200 --> 34:53.600
 of that kind of creative process and I think the types of experiences we've had and then

34:54.480 --> 34:57.600
 one the types of experiences we've had make a big deal to the nature of how we do symbol

34:57.600 --> 35:02.800
 grounding the other thing is the types of experiences we have can't not be interpreted

35:02.800 --> 35:06.960
 through our existing interpretive frames and most of the time our interpretive frames are

35:06.960 --> 35:13.360
 unknown even to us some of them and so this is tricky this is a tricky topic

35:15.200 --> 35:19.840
 so I guess there's a bunch of directions we could go with it but I want to come back to what the

35:20.720 --> 35:25.520
 impulse was that was interesting around what is consciousness and how does it relate to us as

35:25.520 --> 35:31.280
 social beings and how does it relate to the possibility of consciousness with it a eyes

35:31.280 --> 35:36.320
 right you're keeping us on track which is which is wonderful you're a wonderful hiking partner

35:36.320 --> 35:42.720
 okay yes let's go back to the initial impulse of what is consciousness and how does the social

35:42.720 --> 35:50.480
 impulse connect to consciousness is consciousness a consequence of that social connection

35:50.480 --> 35:55.440
 I'm gonna state a position and not argue it because it's honestly like it's a long hard

35:55.440 --> 36:02.800
 thing to argue and we can totally do it another time if you want I don't subscribe

36:02.800 --> 36:08.480
 to consciousness as an emergent property of biology or neural networks

36:10.560 --> 36:17.920
 obviously a lot of people do obviously the the philosophy of science orients towards that in

36:20.000 --> 36:29.440
 not absolutely but largely I think of the nature of first person the universe of first person

36:29.440 --> 36:40.240
 of of qualia as experience sensation desire emotion phenomenology the but the the felt sense not the

36:40.240 --> 36:45.760
 we say emotion and we think of a neurochemical pattern or a integrand pattern but all of

36:45.760 --> 36:51.120
 the physical stuff the third person stuff has position and momentum and charge and stuff like

36:51.120 --> 37:00.160
 that that is measurable repeatable I think of the nature of first person and third person as ontologically

37:00.160 --> 37:06.880
 orthogonal to each other not reducible to each other they're different kinds of stuff and so I

37:06.880 --> 37:11.600
 think about the evolution of third person that we're quite used to thinking about from subatomic

37:11.600 --> 37:16.800
 particles to atoms to molecules to on and on I think about a similar kind of and corresponding

37:16.800 --> 37:21.920
 evolution in the domain of first person from the way whitehead talked about kind of prehension

37:21.920 --> 37:26.560
 or proto qualia in earlier phases of self organization and to higher orders of it and that

37:26.560 --> 37:33.280
 there's correspondence but that neither like the like the idealists do we reduce third person

37:33.280 --> 37:38.160
 to first person which is what idealists do or neither like the physicalists or do we reduce

37:38.160 --> 37:45.520
 first person to third person obviously bone talked about an implicate order that was deeper than

37:45.520 --> 37:50.400
 and gave rise to the explicate order of both natal talks about something like that I have a

37:50.400 --> 37:55.040
 slightly different sense of that but again I'll just kind of not argue how that occurs for a moment

37:55.040 --> 38:02.400
 and say so rather than say does consciousness emerge from I'll talk about do higher capacities of

38:02.400 --> 38:10.240
 consciousness emerge in relationship with so it's not first person as a category emerging from third

38:10.240 --> 38:17.120
 person but increase complexity within the nature of first person and third person co evolving do

38:17.120 --> 38:22.800
 I think that it seems relatively likely that more advanced neural networks have deeper phenomenology

38:22.800 --> 38:30.720
 more complex where it goes just from basic sensation to emotion to social awareness to

38:31.760 --> 38:36.720
 abstract cognition to self reflexive abstract cognition yeah but I wouldn't say that's the

38:36.720 --> 38:40.640
 emergence of consciousness I would say it's increased complexity within the domain of first

38:40.640 --> 38:45.280
 person corresponding to increased complexity and the correspondence should not automatically

38:45.280 --> 38:50.800
 be seen as causal we can get into the arguments for why that often is the case so what I say that

38:51.360 --> 38:58.800
 obviously the sapien brain is pretty unique and a single sapien now has that right even if it took

38:59.360 --> 39:05.120
 sapiens evolving in tribes based on group selection to make that brain so the group made it now that

39:05.120 --> 39:09.600
 brain is there now if I take that a single person with that brain out of the group and try to raise

39:09.600 --> 39:15.600
 them in a box they'll still not be very interesting even with the brain but the brain does give

39:15.600 --> 39:21.680
 hardware capacities that if conditioned in relationship can have interesting things emerge

39:21.680 --> 39:29.520
 so do I think that the the human biology types of human consciousness and types of social

39:29.520 --> 39:36.240
 interaction all co emerged and co evolved yes as a small aside as you're talking about the

39:36.240 --> 39:41.760
 biology let me comment that I spent this is what I do this is what I do with my life this is why

39:41.760 --> 39:47.440
 we'll never accomplish anything is I spent much of the morning trying to calculate trying to do

39:47.440 --> 39:52.640
 research on how many computations the brain performs and how many how much energy it uses

39:52.640 --> 40:01.360
 versus the state of the R CPUs and GPUs now arriving at about 20 quadrillion so that's 2 to the 10 to

40:01.360 --> 40:08.960
 the 16 computations so synaptic firings per second that the brain does and that's about a million

40:08.960 --> 40:20.480
 times faster than the the let's say the 20 thread state of the arts Intel CPU the the 10th generation

40:20.480 --> 40:28.080
 and then there's similar calculation for the for the for the GPU and all ended up also trying to

40:28.080 --> 40:34.160
 compute that it takes 10 watts to run the brain about and then what does that mean terms of calories

40:34.160 --> 40:43.360
 per day kilo calories that's about two for an average human brain that's 250 to 300 calories a

40:43.360 --> 40:53.360
 day and so it ended up being a calculation where you're doing about 20 quadrillion calculations

40:54.160 --> 41:00.880
 that that are fueled by something like depending on your diet three bananas so three bananas results

41:00.880 --> 41:07.200
 in in computation it's about a million times more powerful than the current state of the

41:07.200 --> 41:12.880
 computers now let's take that one step further there's some assumptions built in there the assumption

41:12.880 --> 41:19.840
 is that one what the brain is doing is just computation two the the relevant computations

41:19.840 --> 41:23.040
 are synaptic firings and that there's nothing other than synaptic firings that we have to

41:23.760 --> 41:32.160
 to factor so um i'm forgetting his name right now there's a very uh uh famous neuroscientists

41:32.160 --> 41:36.480
 at stanford just passed away recently who did a lot of the pioneering work on glial cells

41:37.200 --> 41:42.240
 and showed that his assessment glial cells did a huge amount of the thinking not just neurons and

41:42.240 --> 41:46.480
 it opened up this entirely different field of like what the brain is and what consciousness is

41:46.480 --> 41:51.920
 you look at demasio's work on embodied cognition and how much of what we would consider consciousness

41:51.920 --> 41:56.640
 or feeling is happening outside of the nervous system completely happening in endocrine process

41:56.640 --> 42:01.360
 involving lots of other cells and signal communication uh you talk to somebody like

42:01.360 --> 42:05.920
 penrose who you've had on the show and even though the penrose hammerhoff conjecture is

42:05.920 --> 42:10.000
 probably not right is there something like that that might be the case where we're actually having

42:10.000 --> 42:15.920
 to look at stuff happening at the level of quantum computation of microtubules i'm not arguing for

42:15.920 --> 42:21.760
 any of those i'm arguing that we don't know how big the unknown unknown set is well at the very

42:21.760 --> 42:27.920
 least this is this has become like an infomercial for the human brain at the very but wait there's

42:27.920 --> 42:34.480
 more at the very least the three bananas buys you a million times at the very least at the very

42:34.480 --> 42:41.040
 least and then you could have uh and and then the synaptic firings we're referring to is strictly

42:41.040 --> 42:44.640
 the electrical signals that could be the mechanical transmission of information like

42:44.640 --> 42:49.120
 this chemical transmission of information there's there's all kinds of other stuff going on

42:49.120 --> 42:54.240
 and there's memory that's built in that's also all tied in not to mention which i'm learning

42:54.240 --> 43:00.240
 more and more about it's not just about the uh the neurons it's also about the immune system

43:00.240 --> 43:05.920
 that's somehow helping with the computation so the entirety and the entire body is helping

43:05.920 --> 43:10.960
 with the computation so the three bananas they could buy you a lot you could buy you a lot

43:12.000 --> 43:21.360
 but on the topic of sort of uh the greater degrees of complexity emerging in consciousness

43:22.080 --> 43:28.800
 i think few things are as beautiful and inspiring as taking a step outside of the human brain

43:28.800 --> 43:38.240
 just looking at systems or simple rules create incredible complexity uh not create incredible

43:38.240 --> 43:47.840
 complexity emerges so one of the simplest things to do that with is uh cellular automata and there's

43:48.480 --> 43:54.320
 i don't know what it is and maybe you can speak to it we can certainly we will certainly talk about

43:54.320 --> 44:04.560
 the implications of this but there's so few things that are as awe inspiring to me as knowing the rules

44:04.560 --> 44:10.240
 of a system and not being able to predict what the heck it looks like and it creates incredibly

44:10.240 --> 44:17.440
 beautiful complexity that when zoomed out on looks like there's actual organisms doing things

44:17.440 --> 44:28.000
 that are much uh that operate on a scale much higher than the underlying mechanism so with

44:28.000 --> 44:32.880
 cellular automata that's cells that are born and die born or die and they only know about

44:32.880 --> 44:37.200
 each other's neighbors and there's simple rules that govern that interaction of birth and death

44:37.840 --> 44:45.440
 and then they create at scale organisms that look like they take up hundreds or thousands of cells

44:45.440 --> 44:49.920
 and they're moving they're moving around they're communicating they're sending signals to each

44:49.920 --> 44:59.440
 other and you forget at moment of the time before you remember that the simple rules on cells is all

44:59.440 --> 45:09.680
 that it took to create that that's it's sad in that we can't come up with a simple description of that

45:09.680 --> 45:20.640
 system that generalizes the behavior of the large organisms we can only come up we can only hope to

45:20.640 --> 45:25.360
 come up with the thing the fundamental physics or the fundamental rules of that system i suppose

45:25.360 --> 45:30.080
 it's sad that we can't predict everything we know about the mathematics of those systems it seems

45:30.080 --> 45:35.760
 like we can't really in a nice way like economics tries to do to predict how this whole thing will

45:35.760 --> 45:45.920
 unroll but it's beautiful because how simple it is underneath it all so what do you make of the

45:45.920 --> 45:52.320
 emergence of complexity from simple rules what the hell is that about yeah well we can see that

45:52.320 --> 45:58.240
 something like flocking behavior the murmuration can can be computer coded it's not a very hard set

45:58.240 --> 46:05.200
 of rules to be able to see some of those really amazing types of complexity and the whole field

46:05.200 --> 46:10.800
 of complexity science and some of the sub disciplines like stigma g are are studying how following

46:10.800 --> 46:16.480
 fairly simple responses to a pheromone signal do ant colonies do this amazing thing where the

46:16.480 --> 46:21.840
 what what you might describe as the organizational or computational capacity of the colony is so

46:21.840 --> 46:29.200
 profound relative to what each individual um ants is doing i am not um anywhere near as well versed

46:29.200 --> 46:33.920
 in the cutting edge of cellular automatas i would like unfortunately i in terms of topics that i

46:33.920 --> 46:39.760
 would like to get to and haven't like uh et's more um all forms a new kind of science i have only

46:40.560 --> 46:47.360
 skimmed and read reviews of and not read the whole thing or his newer work since um but

46:47.360 --> 46:52.800
 his idea of the four basic kind of categories of uh emergent phenomena that can come from

46:52.800 --> 46:58.080
 cellular automata and that one of them is kind of interesting and looks a lot like complexity

46:58.080 --> 47:04.800
 rather than just uh chaos or homogeneity or um self termination or whatever

47:08.400 --> 47:13.760
 i think this is very interesting it does not instantly make me think that

47:14.320 --> 47:19.680
 biology is operating on a similarly small set of rules and or that human consciousness is i'm

47:19.680 --> 47:28.720
 i'm not that reductionistly oriented and um so if you look at say santa fe institute one of the

47:28.720 --> 47:34.160
 cofounders to our kaufman um his work he should you should really get him on your show so a lot

47:34.160 --> 47:38.960
 of the questions that you like one of kaufman's you know more recent books after investigations

47:38.960 --> 47:42.800
 and some of the real fundamental stuff was called reinventing the sacred and it had to do with some

47:42.800 --> 47:47.760
 of these exact questions uh in kind of non reductionist approach but that is not just

47:47.760 --> 47:54.800
 silly hippieism um and he was very interested in highly non ergodic systems where you couldn't take

47:54.800 --> 47:58.720
 a lot of behavior over a small period of time and predict what the behavior of subsets over a

47:58.720 --> 48:04.240
 longer period of time would do um and then going further someone who spent some time at

48:04.240 --> 48:08.880
 santa fe institute and then kind of made a whole new field that you should have on uh dave snowden

48:08.880 --> 48:15.280
 who some people call the father of anthro complexity or what is the complexity unique to humans uh

48:15.280 --> 48:19.920
 uh he says something to the effect of that modeling humans as termites really doesn't

48:19.920 --> 48:26.320
 cut it like we we we don't respond exactly identically to the same pheromone stimulus using

48:26.320 --> 48:30.800
 stigmer g like it works for flows of traffic and some very simple human behaviors but it really

48:30.800 --> 48:35.440
 doesn't work for trying to make sense of the sistine chapel and picasso and general relativity

48:35.440 --> 48:41.440
 creation and stuff like that and it's because the the termites are not doing abstraction

48:41.440 --> 48:45.920
 forecasting deep into the future and making choices now based on forecasts of the future

48:45.920 --> 48:50.080
 not just adaptive signals in the moment and evolutionary code from history that's really

48:50.080 --> 48:56.640
 different right like making choices now that can factor deep modeling of the future um and with

48:56.640 --> 49:02.800
 humans our uniqueness one to the next in terms of response to similar stimuli is much higher

49:02.800 --> 49:08.560
 than it is with a termite um one of the interesting things there is that their uniqueness is extremely

49:08.560 --> 49:12.560
 low they're basically fungible within a class right the different classes but within a class

49:12.560 --> 49:19.360
 they're basically fungible and their system uses that very high numbers and lots of um loss right

49:19.360 --> 49:23.840
 do you think the termite feels that way don't don't you think we humans are deceiving ourselves

49:23.840 --> 49:29.040
 about our uniqueness perhaps it doesn't just isn't there some sense in which this emergence just

49:29.040 --> 49:33.760
 creates different higher and higher levels of abstraction where every at every layer each

49:33.760 --> 49:40.480
 organism feels unique is that possible the world i think you don't put in a different scales no i

49:40.480 --> 49:50.240
 think uniqueness is evolving i think that hydrogen atoms are more similar to each other than cells

49:50.240 --> 49:53.920
 of the same type are and i think that cells are more similar to each other than humans are

49:54.640 --> 50:00.720
 and i think that highly k selected species are more unique than our selected species so

50:00.720 --> 50:04.800
 they're different evolutionary processes they are selected species where you have a whole

50:05.680 --> 50:13.200
 a lot of death and very high birth rates you're not looking for as much individuality within

50:14.000 --> 50:18.560
 or individual possible expression to cover the evolutionary search space within an individual

50:18.560 --> 50:24.480
 you're looking at it more in terms of a numbers game um so yeah i would say there's probably more

50:24.480 --> 50:29.520
 difference between one orca in the next than there is between one cape buffalo in the next

50:29.520 --> 50:35.920
 given that it would be interesting to get your thoughts about mimetic theory where we're imitating

50:35.920 --> 50:46.080
 each other in the context of this idea of uniqueness how much truth is there to that how

50:46.080 --> 50:56.160
 compelling is this world view to you of gerardian mimetic theory of desire where maybe you can

50:56.160 --> 51:00.880
 explain it from your perspective but it seems like imitating each other is the fundamental

51:02.080 --> 51:08.960
 property of the behavior of human civilization well imitation is not unique to humans right

51:08.960 --> 51:18.000
 monkeys imitate um so a certain amount of learning through observing is not unique to humans humans

51:18.000 --> 51:24.480
 do more of it uh it's actually kind of worth speaking to this for a moment um monkeys can

51:24.480 --> 51:30.640
 learn new behaviors new we've even seen teaching an ape sign language and then the ape teaching

51:30.640 --> 51:36.400
 other apes sign language um so that's a kind of mimesis right kind of learning through imitation

51:37.760 --> 51:42.960
 and that needs to happen if they need to learn or develop capacities that are not just coded by

51:42.960 --> 51:47.760
 their genetics right so within the same genome they're learning new things based on the environment

51:47.760 --> 51:56.480
 and so based on someone else learn something first and so let's pick it up uh how much a creature is

51:56.480 --> 52:00.480
 the result of just its genetic programming and how much it's learning is a very interesting

52:00.480 --> 52:05.760
 question and i think this is a place where humans really show up radically different than

52:05.760 --> 52:13.520
 everything else and you can see it in the in the neotony how long we're basically fetal um

52:13.520 --> 52:20.160
 that a the closest ancestors to us if we look at a chimp a chimp can hold on to its mother's fur

52:20.160 --> 52:25.680
 while she moves around day one and obviously we see horses up and walking within 20 minutes

52:26.400 --> 52:30.480
 the fact that it takes a human a year to be walking and it takes a horse 20 minutes and you

52:30.480 --> 52:34.960
 say how many multiples of 20 minutes go into a year like that's a long period of helplessness

52:35.520 --> 52:42.720
 that wouldn't work for a horse right like they or anything else and and not only can we not hold

52:42.720 --> 52:48.960
 on to mom in the first day it's three months before we can move our head volitionally um so it's like

52:48.960 --> 52:56.640
 why why are we embryonic for so long basically that it's like like it's still fetal on the outside

52:56.640 --> 53:01.440
 had to be because couldn't keep growing inside and actually ever get out with big heads and

53:01.440 --> 53:08.240
 narrower hips from going upright um so here's a place where there's a co evolution of the pattern

53:08.240 --> 53:15.920
 of humans specifically here are our neotony and what that portends to learning with our

53:16.720 --> 53:21.920
 being tool making and environment modifying creatures which is because we have the abstraction

53:21.920 --> 53:26.880
 to make tools we change our environments more than other creatures change their environments the

53:26.880 --> 53:33.360
 next most environment modifying creature tusks is like a beaver and then you wear an la you fly

53:33.360 --> 53:39.520
 into lax and you look at the just orthogonal grid going on forever in all directions and you know

53:39.520 --> 53:43.360
 we we've recently come into the Anthropocene where the surface of the earth is changing more

53:43.360 --> 53:48.320
 for human activity than geological activity and then beavers and you're like okay wow we're really

53:48.320 --> 53:55.120
 in a class of our own in terms of environment modifying yeah um so as soon as we started

53:55.920 --> 54:02.800
 tool making we were able to change our environments much more radically we could put on clothes and

54:02.800 --> 54:08.560
 go to a cold place right and this is really important because we actually went and became apex

54:08.560 --> 54:14.000
 predators in every environment we functioned like apex predators but polar bear can't leave the arctic

54:14.000 --> 54:18.640
 right and the lion can't leave the savannah and an orca can't leave the ocean and we went and became

54:18.640 --> 54:22.560
 apex predators in all those environments because of our tool creation capacity we could become better

54:22.560 --> 54:27.040
 predators and them adapted to the environment or at least with our tools adapted to the environment

54:27.040 --> 54:34.320
 so then every aspect towards any organism in any environment were incredibly good at

54:34.320 --> 54:40.880
 becoming apex predators yes and nothing else can do that kind of thing there there is no other apex

54:40.880 --> 54:46.000
 predator that you see the other apex predator is only getting better at being a predator through

54:46.000 --> 54:51.040
 evolutionary process that's super slow and that super slow process creates co selective process

54:51.040 --> 54:55.680
 with their environment so as the predator becomes a tiny bit faster it eats more of the slow prey

54:55.680 --> 54:59.680
 the genes of the fast prey and breed and the prey becomes faster and so there's this kind of

54:59.680 --> 55:05.680
 balancing and we in because of our tool making we increased our predatory capacity faster than

55:05.680 --> 55:10.320
 anything else could increase its resilience to it as a result we started out stripping the

55:10.320 --> 55:15.200
 environment and extincting species following stone tools and going and becoming apex predator

55:15.200 --> 55:18.240
 everywhere this is why we can't keep applying apex predator theories because we're not an apex

55:18.240 --> 55:23.680
 predator we're an apex predator but we're something much more than that um like just for an example

55:23.680 --> 55:29.920
 the the top apex predator in the world in orca an orca can eat one big fish at a time like one tuna

55:29.920 --> 55:36.000
 and it'll miss most of the time or one seal and we can put a mile long drift net out on a single

55:36.000 --> 55:41.920
 boat and pull up an entire school of them right we can deplete the entire oceans of them that's

55:41.920 --> 55:47.040
 not an orca right like that's not an apex predator um and that's not even including that we can then

55:47.040 --> 55:52.640
 genetically engineer different creatures we can extinct species we can devastate whole ecosystems

55:52.640 --> 55:56.320
 we can make built worlds that have no natural things that are just human built worlds we can

55:56.320 --> 56:01.120
 build new types of natural creatures synthetic life so we are much more like little gods than

56:01.120 --> 56:04.800
 we are like apex predators now but we're still behaving as apex predators and little gods that

56:04.800 --> 56:09.440
 behave as apex predators causes a problem kind of core to my assessment of the world

56:10.560 --> 56:17.520
 so what does it mean to be a predator so a predator is uh somebody that effectively can

56:17.520 --> 56:25.840
 mine the resources from a place so for their survival or is it also just purely like higher

56:25.840 --> 56:32.720
 level objectives of violence and what is can predators be predators towards the same each

56:32.720 --> 56:37.760
 other towards the same species like are we think are we using the word predator sort of generally

56:37.760 --> 56:44.320
 which then connects to conflict and uh military conflict violent conflict in in this space of

56:44.320 --> 56:49.280
 human species obviously we can say that plants are mining the resources of their environment in a

56:49.280 --> 56:54.560
 particular way using photosynthesis to be able to pull minerals out of the soil and nitrogen and

56:54.560 --> 57:00.400
 carbon out of the air and like that um and we can say herbivores are being able to mine and

57:00.400 --> 57:05.040
 concentrate that so i wouldn't say mining the environment is unique to predator predator is

57:05.040 --> 57:19.040
 you know uh generally being defined as mining other animals right we don't consider herbivores

57:19.040 --> 57:26.160
 predators but um animal which requires some type of violence capacity because animals move plants

57:26.160 --> 57:33.920
 don't move so requires some capacity to uh overtake something that can move and try to get away um

57:33.920 --> 57:39.600
 we'll go back to the juridzing then we'll come back here why are we neoteness why are we embryonic

57:39.600 --> 57:46.960
 for so long because are we did we just move from the savannah to the arctic and we need to learn

57:46.960 --> 57:52.400
 new stuff if we came genetically programmed we would not be able to do that are we throwing

57:52.400 --> 57:57.280
 spears or are we fishing or are we running an industrial supply chain or are we texting what

57:57.280 --> 58:02.320
 is the adaptive behavior horses today in the wild and horses 10 000 years ago we're doing

58:02.320 --> 58:08.720
 pretty much the same stuff and so since we make tools and we involve our tools and then change

58:08.720 --> 58:13.440
 our environment so quickly and other animals are largely the result of their environment but we're

58:13.440 --> 58:18.720
 environment modifying so rapidly we need to come without too much programming so we can learn the

58:18.720 --> 58:25.280
 environment we're in learn the language right which is uh gonna be very important learn the

58:25.280 --> 58:31.280
 tool making learn the um and so we have a very long period of relative helpless of helplessness

58:31.280 --> 58:36.080
 because we aren't coded how to behave yet because we're imprinting a lot of software on how to behave

58:36.080 --> 58:41.360
 that is useful to that particular time so our mimesis is not it's not unique to humans but

58:41.360 --> 58:46.960
 the total amount of it is really unique and this is also where the uniqueness can go up right is

58:46.960 --> 58:51.760
 because we are less just the result of the genetics and that means the kind of learning

58:51.760 --> 58:57.360
 through history that they got coded in genetics and more the result of it's almost like our hardware

58:57.360 --> 59:02.880
 selected for software right like if evolution is kind of doing these think of as a hardware

59:02.880 --> 59:09.120
 selection i have problems with computer metaphors for biology but i'll use this one here um that

59:10.320 --> 59:16.800
 we have not had hardware changes since the beginning of sapiens but our world is really

59:16.800 --> 59:23.600
 really different and that's all changes in software right changes in on the same fundamental genetic

59:23.600 --> 59:29.520
 substrate what we're doing with these brains and minds and bodies and social groups and like that

59:30.400 --> 59:40.640
 and so um now giard specifically was looking at when we watch other people talking so we

59:40.640 --> 59:44.240
 learn language you and i would have a hard time learning mandarin today or it'd take a lot of

59:44.240 --> 59:47.920
 work we'd be learning how to conjugate verbs and stuff but a baby learns it instantly without

59:47.920 --> 59:51.440
 anyone even really trying to teach it just through mimesis so it's a it's a powerful thing

59:51.440 --> 59:55.360
 they're obviously more neuroplastic than we are when they're doing that and all their

59:55.360 --> 59:59.520
 attention is allocated to that but they're also learning how to move their bodies and

59:59.520 --> 1:00:03.680
 they're learning all kinds of stuff through mimesis one of the things that giard says is

1:00:03.680 --> 1:00:08.800
 they're also learning what to want and they learn what to want they learn desire by watching

1:00:08.800 --> 1:00:13.840
 what other people want and so intrinsic to this people end up wanting what other people want

1:00:13.840 --> 1:00:20.160
 and if we can't have what other people have without taking it away from them then that

1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:26.000
 becomes a source of conflict so uh the mimesis of desire is the fundamental generator of conflict

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:31.920
 and that then the conflict energy within a group of people will build over time

1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:38.160
 this is a very very crude interpretation of the theory can we just pause on that for people who

1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:43.840
 are not familiar and for me who hasn't i'm loosely familiar but haven't internalized it but every

1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:50.320
 time i think about it's a very compelling view of the world whether it's true or not it's quite

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:55.680
 it's like when you take everything Freud says is true it's a very interesting way to think about

1:00:55.680 --> 1:01:05.120
 the world and in the same way thinking about the memetic theory of desire that everything we want

1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:14.400
 is imitation of other people's wants we don't have any original wants we're constantly imitating

1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:22.080
 others and so and not just others but you know others we're exposed to so there's these like

1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:28.240
 little local pockets however define local of people like imitating each other and uh one

1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:33.920
 that's super empowering because then you can pick which group you can join like what what do you

1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:40.320
 want to imitate it's uh it's the old like you know whoever your friends are that's what your

1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:46.160
 life is going to be like that's really powerful i mean it's depressing that we're so unoriginal

1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:53.040
 but it's also liberating in that if this holds true that we can choose our life by choosing

1:01:53.040 --> 1:01:59.600
 the people we hang out with so okay thoughts that are very compelling that seem like they're more

1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:05.440
 absolute than they actually are end up also being dangerous we want communism um i'm i'm

1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:11.200
 gonna discuss here where i think we need to amend this particular theory but specifically you just

1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:16.400
 said something that everyone who's paid attention knows is true experientially which is who you're

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:23.600
 around affects who you become and as as libertarian and self determining and sovereign as we'd like

1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:30.960
 to be um everybody i think knows that if you got put in the maximum security prison aspects of your

1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:35.200
 personality would have to adapt or you wouldn't survive there right you would become different

1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:40.000
 if you were if if you grew up in darfur versus finland you would be different with your same

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:46.640
 genetics like just just no real question about that um and that even today if you hang out in a place

1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:52.960
 with ultramarathoners as your roommates or um all people who are obese as your roommates the

1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:56.880
 statistical likelihood of what happens to your fitness is pretty clear right like the behavioral

1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:02.240
 science of this pretty clear so uh the whole saying we are the average of the five people we

1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:06.640
 spend the most time around i think the more self reflective someone is the more time they spend by

1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:10.880
 themselves in self reflection the less this is true but it's still true so one of the best

1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:16.880
 things someone can do to become more self determined is be self determined about the environments

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:20.640
 they want to put themselves in because to the degree that there is some self determination

1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:24.880
 and some determination by the environment don't be fighting an environment that is predisposing

1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:28.880
 you in bad directions try to put yourself in an environment that is predisposing the things

1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:33.520
 that you want in turn try to affect the environment in ways to predispose positive things for those

1:03:33.520 --> 1:03:38.880
 around you or perhaps also to there there's probably interesting ways to play with this you

1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:46.080
 could probably put yourself like form connections that have this perfect tension in all directions

1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:51.360
 to where you're actually free to decide whatever the heck you want because the set of wants within

1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:58.560
 your circle of interactions is so conflicting that you're free to choose whichever one so if

1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:03.760
 there's enough tension as opposed to everybody aligned like a flock of birds yeah i mean you

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:13.440
 definitely want that all of the dialectics would be balanced so if you have someone who is extremely

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:18.640
 oriented to self empowerment and someone who's extremely oriented to kind of empathy and compassion

1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:24.320
 both the dialectic of those is better than either of them on their own if you have both of them

1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:29.120
 inhabiting being inhabited better than you by the same person spending time around that person will

1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:34.640
 probably do well for you i think the thing you just mentioned is super important when it comes to

1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:41.680
 cognitive schools which is i think one of the fastest things people can do to improve their

1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:49.840
 learning and they're not just cognitive learning but their meaningful problem solving communication

1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:54.320
 and civic capacity capacity to participate as a citizen with other people and making the world

1:04:54.320 --> 1:05:02.000
 better is to be seeking dialectical synthesis all the time and so in the Hegelian sense if you have

1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:08.720
 a thesis you have an antithesis so maybe we have libertarianism on one side and marxist kind of

1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:16.160
 communism on the other side and one is arguing that the individual is the unit of choice and so

1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:21.760
 we want to increase the freedom and support of individual choice because as they make more

1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:25.360
 agentic choices it'll produce a better whole for everybody the other side saying well the

1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:28.960
 individuals are conditioned by their environment who would choose to be born into Darfur rather

1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:37.120
 than Finland so we actually need to collectively make environments that are good because that the

1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:42.400
 environment conditions the individuals so you have a thesis and an antithesis and then Hegel's

1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:46.960
 idea is you have a synthesis which is a kind of higher order truth that understands how those relate

1:05:46.960 --> 1:05:52.240
 in a way that neither of them do and so it is actually at a higher order of complexity so the

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:56.560
 first part would be can I steal man each of these can I argue each one well enough that the

1:05:56.560 --> 1:06:01.840
 proponents of it are like totally you got that and not just argue it rhetorically but can I inhabit

1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:06.720
 it where I can try to see and feel the world the way someone seeing and feeling the world that way

1:06:06.720 --> 1:06:12.480
 would because once I do then I don't want to screw those people because there's truth in it right

1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:15.760
 and I'm not going to go back to war with them I'm going to go to finding solutions that could

1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:21.760
 actually work at a higher order if I don't go to a higher order then there's war and but then the

1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:27.280
 higher order thing would be well it seems like the individual does affect the commons and the

1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:31.680
 collective and other people it also seems like the collective conditions individuals at least

1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:36.880
 statistically and I can cherry pick out the one guy who got out of the ghetto and pulled himself

1:06:36.880 --> 1:06:40.800
 up by his bootstraps but I can also say statistically that most people born into the ghetto

1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:47.600
 show up differently than most people born into the Hamptons and so unless you want to argue that

1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:51.280
 and have you take your child from the Hamptons and put them in the ghetto then like come on be

1:06:51.280 --> 1:06:58.320
 realistic about this thing so how do we make we don't want social systems that make weak dependent

1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:04.320
 individuals right the welfare argument but we also don't want no social system that supports

1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:11.200
 individuals to do better we want we don't want individuals where their self expression and agency

1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:16.240
 fucks the environment and everybody else and employs slave labor and whatever so can we make

1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:22.320
 it to where individuals are creating holes that are better for conditioning other individuals can

1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:26.640
 we make it to where we have holes that are conditioning increased agency and sovereignty

1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:32.000
 right that would be the synthesis so the thing that I'm coming to here is if people have that as

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:36.400
 a frame and sometimes it's not just thesis nante thesis it's like eight different views right

1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:42.240
 can I steal man each view this is not just can I take the perspective but am I seeking them am I

1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:48.960
 actively trying to inhabit other people's perspective then can I really try to essentialize

1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:53.760
 it and argue the the best points of it both the sense making about reality and the values

1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:59.920
 why these values actually matter then just like I want to seek those perspectives then I want to

1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:07.760
 seek is there a higher order set of understandings that could fulfill the values of and synthesize

1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:11.760
 the sense making of all of them simultaneously maybe I won't get it but I want to be seeking it

1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:16.720
 and I want to be seeking progressively better ones so this is perspective seeking driving

1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:27.120
 perspective taking and then seeking synthesis I think that that one cognitive disposition

1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:34.640
 might be the most helpful thing would you put a title of dialectic synthesis on that process

1:08:34.640 --> 1:08:42.400
 because that seems to be such a part so like this rigorous empathy like like it's not just empathy

1:08:42.400 --> 1:08:48.320
 it's empathy with rigor like you really want to understand and embody different worldviews and

1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:54.640
 then try to find a higher order synthesis okay so I remember last night you told me when we first

1:08:54.640 --> 1:09:00.880
 met you said that you looked in somebody's eyes and you felt that you had suffered in some ways

1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:05.360
 that they had suffered and so you could trust them sure shared pathos right creates a certain

1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:10.320
 sense of kind of shared bonding and shared intimacy so empathy is actually feeling the

1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:15.120
 suffering of somebody else and feeling the the depth of their sentience I don't want to fuck

1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:19.680
 them anymore and I mean I hurt them I don't want to behave in a I don't want my proposition to go

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:23.920
 through when I go and inhabit the perspective of the other people they feel that's really going to

1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:29.600
 mess them up right and so the rigorous empathy it's different than just compassion which is I

1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:34.720
 generally care like I have a generalized care but I don't know what it's like to be them I can never

1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:38.960
 know what it's like to be them perfectly and that there's a humility you have to have which is my

1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:45.120
 most rigorous attempt is still not it my most rigorous attempt mine to know what it's like

1:09:45.120 --> 1:09:48.880
 to be a woman is still not it I have no question that if I was actually a woman it would be different

1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:54.320
 than my best guesses I have no question if I was actually black it's be different than my best guesses

1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:58.560
 so there's a humility in that which keeps me listening because I don't think that I know fully

1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:03.920
 but I want to and I'm going to keep trying better to and then I want to across them and then I want

1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:08.800
 to say is there a way we can forward together and not have to be in war it has to be something that

1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:13.840
 could meet the values that everyone holds it could reconcile the partial sense making that

1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:20.080
 everyone holds and they could offer a way forward that is more agreeable than the partial perspectives

1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:25.840
 that were with each other but the more you succeeded this empathy with humility the more

1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:31.760
 you're carrying the burden of their of other people's pain essentially now this goes back to

1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:43.520
 the question of do I see us as one being or 7.8 billion I think them if I'm overwhelmed with

1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:48.880
 my own pain I can't empathize that much because I don't have the bandwidth I don't have the capacity

1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:53.200
 if I don't feel like I can do something about a particular problem in the world it's hard to

1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:58.880
 feel it because it's just too devastating and so a lot of people go numb and even go nihilistic

1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:04.000
 because they just don't feel the agency so as I actually become more empowered as an individual

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:08.400
 and have more sense of agency I also become more empowered to be more empathetic for others and

1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:14.160
 be more connected to that shared burden and want to be able to make choices on behalf of and in

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:23.120
 and in benefit of so this way of living seems like a way of living that would solve a lot of

1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:29.760
 problems in society from a cellular automata perspective so if you have a bunch of little

1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:34.880
 like little agents behaving in this way my intuition there'll be interesting complexities

1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:39.920
 that are merged but my intuition is it will create a society that's very different and

1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:48.480
 recognizably better than the one we have today how much like oh wait hold that question because I

1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:52.480
 want to come back to it but this brings us back to Jared which we didn't answer the conflict theory

1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:56.480
 yes because about how to get past the conflict theory yes you know the Robert Frost poem about

1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:01.200
 the two paths he never had time to turn back to the other we're gonna have to do that quite a lot

1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:09.360
 we're gonna be uh living that poem over and over again but yes how how to uh let's return back

1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:14.960
 okay so the rest of the argument goes you learn to want what other people want therefore fundamental

1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:20.000
 conflict based in our desire because we want the thing that somebody else has and then people are

1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:25.840
 they're in conflict over trying to get the same stuff power status attention physical stuff

1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:31.360
 a mate whatever it is and then the we learn the conflict by watching and so then the conflict

1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:36.800
 becomes a medic so the and you know we become on the the Palestinian side of the Israeli side of

1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:42.080
 the communist like capitalist side or the left or right politically or whatever it is and until

1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:47.760
 eventually the conflict energy in the system builds up so much that some type of violence is needed

1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:52.800
 to get the bad guy whoever it is that we're gonna blame and you know Jorard talks about why scapegoating

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.240
 was kind of a mechanism to minimize the amount of violence let's blame let's blame it a set a

1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:01.840
 scapegoat as being more relevant than they really were but if we all believe it then we can all kind

1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:06.720
 of calm down with the conflict energy it's a really interesting concept by the way i mean you went

1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:11.520
 you beautifully summarized it but the idea that there's a scapegoat that there's a this kind of

1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:17.600
 thing naturally still conflict and then they find the other some group that's the other that's either

1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:23.200
 real artificial as the cause of the conflict well it's always artificial because the cause of the

1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:28.240
 conflict in jorard is the mimesis of desire itself and how do we attack that how do we attack that

1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:33.520
 it's our own desire so this now gets to something more like buddha said right which was desire as

1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:41.520
 the cause of suffering um jorard and buddha would kind of agree in this way so and so but that's

1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:47.760
 that explains i mean again it's a compelling description of human history that we do tend to

1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:54.560
 come up with the other and okay kind of i just i just had such a funny experience with someone

1:13:54.560 --> 1:14:02.640
 critiquing jorard the other day in such a elegant and beautiful and simple way it's a a friend who's a

1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:12.960
 uh grew up aboriginal australian uh is a scholar of aboriginal social technologies and he's like

1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:18.880
 nah man jorard just made shit up about how tribes work like we come from a tribe we've got tens of

1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:23.600
 thousands of years and we didn't have increasing conflict and then scapegoat and kill someone

1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:27.040
 we'd have a little bit of conflict and then we would dance and then everybody'd be fine

1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:30.960
 like we'd dance around the campfire everyone would like kind of physically get the energy out

1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:36.160
 we'd look in each other's eyes we'd have positive bonding and then we're fine and nobody no scapegoats

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:42.960
 and i think that's called the joe rogan theory of desire which is uh he's like all all of human

1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:48.400
 problems have to do with the fact that you don't do enough hard shit in your day uh so maybe maybe

1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:52.480
 just dance it because he says like doing exercise and running on that treadmill gets gets all the

1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:56.960
 demons out maybe just dancing gets all the demons out so this is why i say we have to be careful

1:14:56.960 --> 1:15:02.960
 with taking an idea that seems too explanatory and then taking it as a given and then saying well

1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:08.800
 now that we're stuck with the fact that conflict is inexorable because human because mimetic desire

1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:13.120
 and therefore how do we deal with the inexorability of the conflict and how to sublimate violence

1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:17.600
 no the whole thing might be actually gibberish meaning it's only true in certain conditions

1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:22.080
 and other conditions it's not true so the deeper question is under which conditions is that true

1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:26.080
 under which conditions is it not true what do those other conditions make possible and look like

1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:31.280
 and in general we should stay away from really compelling models of reality because there's

1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:36.480
 something about about our brains that these models become sticky and we can't even think outside of

1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:40.640
 them so it's not that we stay away from them it's that we know that the model of reality is never

1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:46.400
 reality that's the key thing humility again it goes back to just having the humility that you

1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:51.840
 don't have a perfect model of reality there's an the the model of reality could never be reality

1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:59.920
 the process of modeling is inherently information reduction and i can never show that the unknown

1:15:59.920 --> 1:16:07.920
 unknown set has been factored um it's back to the cellular automata you can't you can't uh put the uh

1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:15.520
 genie back in bottle like uh when you realize it's unfortunately sadly impossible to um

1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:24.720
 um to create a model of cellular automata even if you know the basic rules that predict to even

1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:32.240
 any degree of accuracy what uh um how that system will evolve which is fascinating mathematically

1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:40.160
 sorry i i think about it quite a lot it's very annoying wolfram has this rule 30 like you should

1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:47.520
 be able to predict it it's so simple but you can't predict what's going to be like there's a there's a

1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:53.200
 problem he defines like try to predict some aspect of the middle middle column of the system just

1:16:53.200 --> 1:17:01.760
 anything about it what's going to happen in the future and you can't you can't it sucks because

1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:08.240
 then we can't make sense of this world in a real in a reality in a definitive way it's always like

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:16.560
 in the striving like it we're always striving yeah i don't think this sucks that so that's a feature

1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:23.680
 not a bug well that's assuming a designer um i would say i don't think it sucks i think it's

1:17:24.480 --> 1:17:32.400
 not only beautiful but maybe necessary for beauty the mess so you're uh so you're you're

1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:37.200
 disagree jordan pierce you should clean up your room see you like the rooms messy it's uh it's

1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:44.800
 essential for the for beauty it's not it's not that it's okay i take i have no idea if it was

1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:50.400
 intended this way and so i'm just interpreting it a way i like the commandment about having no false

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:59.280
 idols to me the way i interpret that is meaningful is that reality is sacred to me i have a reverence

1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:06.240
 for reality but i know my best understanding of it is never complete i know my best model of it

1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:13.440
 is a model where i tried to make some kind of predictive capacity by reducing the complexity

1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:17.840
 of it to a set of stuff that i could observe and then a subset of that stuff that i thought was the

1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:22.560
 causal dynamics and then some set of you know mechanisms that are involved and what we find

1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:28.320
 is that it can be super useful like newtonian gravity can help us do ballistic curves and

1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:33.440
 all kinds of super useful stuff and then we get to the place where it doesn't explain what's happening

1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:41.200
 at the cosmological scale or at a quantum scale and at each time what we're finding is uh we

1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:45.920
 exclude itself and it also doesn't explain the reconciliation of gravity with quantum mechanics

1:18:45.920 --> 1:18:51.040
 and the other kind of fundamental laws and the so models can be useful but they're never true with

1:18:51.040 --> 1:18:58.160
 a capital t meaning they're never an actual real full they're never a complete description of what's

1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:02.080
 happening in real systems they can be a complete description of what's happening in an artificial

1:19:02.080 --> 1:19:06.160
 system that was the result of applying a model so the model of a circuit board and the circuit

1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:09.680
 board are the same thing but i would argue that the model of a cell and the cell are not the same

1:19:09.680 --> 1:19:17.120
 thing and i would say this is key to what we call complexity versus the complicated which is a

1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:24.000
 distinction davis noden made well um in defining the difference between simple complicated complex

1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:29.520
 and chaotic systems um but one of the definers in complex systems is that no matter how you model

1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:33.200
 the complex system it will still have some emergent behavior not predicted by the model

1:19:34.080 --> 1:19:38.640
 can you elaborate on the complex versus the complicated complicated means we can fully

1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:44.640
 explicate the phase space of all the things that it can do we can program it uh all human

1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:49.760
 not all for the most part human built things are complicated they don't self organize

1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:55.440
 they don't self repair they're not self evolving and we can make a blueprint for them

1:19:55.440 --> 1:20:01.200
 um where sorry for human systems for human technologies human technologies sorry so okay

1:20:01.200 --> 1:20:08.080
 so so not that are basically the application of models right right and engineering is kind

1:20:08.080 --> 1:20:15.760
 of applied science science as the modeling process and but with but humans are complex

1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:21.680
 complex stuff with biological type stuff um and sociological type stuff it more has generator

1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:28.640
 functions and even those can't be fully explicated than it has or our explanation can't prove that

1:20:28.640 --> 1:20:32.800
 it has closure of what would be in the unknown unknown set where we keep finding like oh it's

1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:36.560
 just the genome oh well now it's the genome and the epigenome and then a recursive change on the

1:20:36.560 --> 1:20:40.560
 epigenome because of the proteome and then there's mitochondrial dna and then virus is affected

1:20:40.560 --> 1:20:47.360
 and fuck right so it's like we get overexcited when we think we found the thing so on facebook

1:20:47.360 --> 1:20:52.000
 you know how you can list your relationship as complicated it should actually say it's it's complex

1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:57.760
 that's the more accurate description you uh self terminating is a really interesting idea that you

1:20:57.760 --> 1:21:06.160
 talk about quite a bit first of all what is a self terminating system and i think you have a

1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:13.040
 sense correct me if i'm wrong that human civilization as it currently is is a self terminating system

1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:20.400
 um why do you have that intuition combined with the definition of what's of self terminating

1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:32.800
 means okay so if we look at human societies historically human civilizations uh it's not

1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:36.880
 that hard to realize that most of the major civilizations and empires of the past don't

1:21:36.880 --> 1:21:41.920
 exist anymore so they had a life cycle they died for some reason so we don't still have in it

1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:47.360
 the early egyptian empire or inka or maya or aztec or any of those right and so

1:21:48.640 --> 1:21:52.880
 they they terminated sometimes it seems like they were terminated from the outside in war

1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:55.840
 sometimes it seems like they self terminate when we look at easter island it was a self

1:21:55.840 --> 1:22:01.840
 termination um so let's go ahead and take an island situation if i have an island and we

1:22:01.840 --> 1:22:06.160
 are consuming the resources on that island faster than the resources can replicate themselves and

1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:10.480
 there's a finite space there that system is going to self terminate it's not going to be able to

1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:16.720
 keep doing that thing because you'll get to a place of there's no resources left and then you get uh

1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:22.320
 so now if i'm utilizing the resources faster than they can replicate or faster than they

1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:26.640
 can replenish and i'm actually growing our population in the process i'm even increasing

1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:32.400
 the rate of the utilization of resources i might get an exponential curve and then hit a wall and

1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:37.360
 then just collapse the exponential curve rather than do an s curve or some other kind of thing

1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:46.480
 um so self terminating system is any system that depends upon a substrate system that is

1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:53.280
 debasing its own substrate that is debasing what it depends upon so you're right that uh if you

1:22:53.280 --> 1:23:00.320
 look at empires they rise and fall throughout human history but but not this time bro where

1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:07.920
 where this one's gonna last forever that's i like that idea i think that if we don't understand why

1:23:07.920 --> 1:23:12.400
 all the previous ones failed we can't ensure that and so i think it's very important to understand

1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:18.800
 it well so that we can have that be a designed outcome with some what decent probability so

1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:24.400
 we're it's sort of in terms of consuming the resources on the island we're a clever bunch

1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:32.720
 and we keep coming up especially when the on the horizon there is a termination point

1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:40.400
 we keep coming up with clever ways of avoiding disaster of avoiding collapse of constructing

1:23:40.400 --> 1:23:44.640
 this is where technological innovation this is where growth comes in coming up with different

1:23:44.640 --> 1:23:50.000
 ways to improve productivity and the way society functions such that we consume less resources

1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:58.560
 or get a lot more from the resources we have so there's some sense in which there's a human

1:23:58.560 --> 1:24:05.280
 ingenuity is a source for optimism about the future of this particular system that that may

1:24:05.280 --> 1:24:14.080
 not be self terminating if if there's more innovation than there is consumption so over

1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:20.160
 consumption of resources just one way i think can self terminate we're just kind of starting here but

1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:27.680
 there are reasons for optimism and pessimism then they're both worth understanding and there's

1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:33.200
 failure modes on understanding either without the other as we mentioned previously there

1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:39.200
 there's what i would call naive techno optimism naive techno capital optimism

1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:44.160
 that says stuff just has been getting better and better and we wouldn't want to live in the dark

1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:50.400
 ages and tech has done all this awesome stuff and we know the proponents of those models and

1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:53.440
 this stuff is going to kind of keep getting better of course there are problems but human

1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:57.680
 ingenuity rises to its apply and demand will solve the problems whatever would you put raker as well

1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:05.440
 on that or in that bucket is there some specific people you have in mind or naive optimism is

1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:11.280
 truly naive to where you're essentially just have an optimism that's blind to any kind of realities

1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:20.480
 of the way technology progresses i don't think that anyone who thinks about it and writes about

1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:26.400
 it is perfectly naive gotcha but there might play time it's a platonic ideal there there might be a

1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:32.000
 bias in the nature of the assessment i would also say there's kind of naive techno pessimism

1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.560
 and there are

1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:45.280
 critics of technology i mean you read the unabombers manifesto on why technology can't

1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:48.800
 not result in our self termination so we have to take it out before it gets any further

1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:57.440
 but also if you read a lot of the ex risk community you know boss drum and friends it's like our

1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:02.240
 total number of existential risks and the total probability of them is going up

1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:12.080
 and so i think that there are we have to hold together where our positive possibilities and our

1:26:12.080 --> 1:26:17.760
 risk possibilities are both increasing and then say for the positive possibilities to be realized

1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:24.160
 long term all of the catastrophic risks have to not happen any of the catastrophic risks happening

1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:29.360
 is enough to keep that positive outcome from occurring so how do we ensure that none of them

1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:34.640
 happen if we want to say let's have a civilization that doesn't collapse so again collapse theory

1:26:35.200 --> 1:26:40.720
 it's worth looking at books like the collapse of complex societies by joseph tainter it does an

1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:49.920
 analysis of that many of the societies fell for internal institutional decay civilizational decay

1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:55.680
 reasons bowdryard in simulation and simulacra looks at a very different way of looking at how

1:26:55.680 --> 1:27:00.000
 institutional decay and the collective intelligence of a system happens and it becomes kind of more

1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:05.040
 internally parasitic on itself um obviously jarrod diamond made a more popular book called collapse

1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:10.480
 and as we were mentioning the anti catheria mechanism has been getting attention in the

1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:15.760
 news lately but it's like a 2000 year old clock right like like metal gears and

1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:24.400
 and does that mean we lost like 1500 years of technological progress um and from a society

1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:32.240
 that was relatively technologically advanced um so what i'm interested in here is being able to

1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:41.120
 say okay well why did previous societies fail can we understand that abstractly enough that we can

1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:47.440
 and make a civilizational model that isn't just trying to solve one type of failure but solve

1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:52.880
 the underlying things that generate the failures as a whole are there some underlying generator

1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:58.320
 functions or patterns that would make a system self terminating and can we solve those and have

1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:03.920
 that be the kernel of a new civilizational model that is not self terminating and can we then be

1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:07.840
 able to actually look at the categories of extras we're aware of and see that we actually have

1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:14.400
 resilience in the presence of those not just resilience but anti fragility and i would say

1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:20.480
 for the optimism to be grounded it has to actually be able to understand the risk space well and have

1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:28.960
 adequate solutions for it so can we try to dig into some basic intuitions about the underlying

1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:35.840
 sources of catastrophic failures of the system and overconsumption that's built in into

1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:41.920
 self terminating systems so both the overconsumption which is like the slow death and then there's the

1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:48.960
 fast death of nuclear war and all those kinds of things a agi biotech bioengineering nanotechnology

1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:58.160
 nano my favorite nanobots okay nanobots are my favorite because it sounds so cool to me

1:28:58.160 --> 1:29:02.640
 that i could just know that i would be one of the scientists that would be full steam ahead

1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:09.600
 in building them without sufficiently thinking about the negative consequence i would definitely be

1:29:09.600 --> 1:29:16.160
 i would be podcasting all about the negative consequences but when i go back home i'd be

1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:21.920
 i just in my heart know the amount of excitement is a dumb descendant of ape no offense to apes

1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:31.200
 so i want to backtrack on my previous comments about negative comments about apes

1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:40.240
 that i have that sense of excitement that would result in problems so sorry a lot of things said

1:29:40.240 --> 1:29:45.840
 but what can we start to pull it a thread because you've also provided kind of a beautiful

1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:54.640
 general approach to this which is this dialectic synthesis or just rigorous empathy whatever

1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:58.960
 whatever word we're going to put to it that seems to be from the individual perspective

1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:04.480
 is one way to sort of live in the world as we try to figure out how to construct non self

1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:10.240
 terminating systems so what what are some underlying sources yeah first i have to say

1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:17.600
 uh i i actually really respect Drexler for emphasizing gray goo and engines of creation

1:30:17.600 --> 1:30:24.800
 back in the day um to make sure the world was paying adequate attention to the risks of the

1:30:24.800 --> 1:30:30.480
 the nanotech um as someone who was right at the cutting edge of what could be um

1:30:32.240 --> 1:30:37.200
 there's definitely game theoretic advantage to those who focus on the opportunities and

1:30:37.200 --> 1:30:46.720
 don't focus on the risks or pretend there aren't risks um because they get to market first um and

1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:51.840
 then they externalize all of the costs through limited liability or whatever it is to the commons

1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:55.200
 or wherever happened to have it other people are going to have to solve those but now they have the

1:30:55.200 --> 1:30:59.120
 power and capital associated the person who looked at the risks and tried to do better design and go

1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:04.320
 slower um is probably not going to move into positions of as much power influence as quickly

1:31:04.320 --> 1:31:08.720
 so this one of the issues we have to deal with is some of the the bad game theoretic dispositions

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:15.120
 in the system relative to its own um stability and the key aspect of that sorry to interrupt is

1:31:15.120 --> 1:31:21.520
 the externalities generated yes what flavors of catastrophic risk are we talking about here

1:31:21.520 --> 1:31:26.480
 what's your favorite flavor in terms of ice cream so mine is coconut nobody seems to like

1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:35.280
 coconut ice cream uh so ice cream aside what's uh what do you most worry about there's a catastrophic

1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:43.120
 risk that will help us kind of um make concrete the the the discussion we're having about how to

1:31:43.120 --> 1:31:48.560
 fix this whole thing yeah i think it's worth taking a historical perspective briefly to just

1:31:48.560 --> 1:31:53.920
 kind of orient everyone to it we don't have to um go all the way back to the aliens who've seen all

1:31:53.920 --> 1:32:00.480
 of civilization but to just recognize that um for all of human history as far as we're aware

1:32:02.640 --> 1:32:08.400
 there were existential risks to civilizations and they happened right like there were civilizations

1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:13.840
 that were killed in war um that tribes that were killed in tribal warfare or whatever so

1:32:14.480 --> 1:32:18.960
 people faced existential risk to the group that they identified with it's just those were local

1:32:18.960 --> 1:32:24.160
 phenomena right they it wasn't a fully global phenomena so an empire could fall in surrounding

1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:32.080
 empires didn't fall maybe they came in filled the space um the first time that we were able to

1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:37.440
 think about catastrophic risk not from like a solar flare or something that we couldn't control but

1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:41.840
 from something that humans would actually create at a global level was world war two in the bomb

1:32:42.720 --> 1:32:46.240
 because it was the first time that we had tech big enough that could actually

1:32:46.240 --> 1:32:50.480
 mess up everything at a global level that could mess up habitability we just weren't

1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:54.720
 powerful enough to do that before it's it's not that we didn't behave in ways that would have

1:32:54.720 --> 1:33:00.560
 done it we just you only behaved in those ways at the scale we could affect and so it's important

1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:06.080
 to get that there's the entire world before world war two where we don't have the ability to make a

1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:11.520
 non habitable biosphere non habitable for us and then there's world war two and the beginning

1:33:11.520 --> 1:33:17.200
 of a completely new phase where global human induced catastrophic risk is now a real thing

1:33:18.320 --> 1:33:23.120
 and that was such a big deal that it changed the entire world in a really fundamental way

1:33:23.120 --> 1:33:28.320
 which is you know when you study history it's amazing how big a percentage of history is

1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:33.280
 studying war right in the the history of wars you study european history whatever it's generals

1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:39.360
 and wars and empire expansions and and so the the major empires near each other never had really

1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:43.760
 long periods of time where they weren't engaged in war or preparation for war or something like

1:33:43.760 --> 1:33:50.560
 that was humans don't have a good precedent in the post tribal phase the civilization phase of

1:33:50.560 --> 1:33:56.560
 being able to solve conflicts without war for very long world war two was the first time where

1:33:57.520 --> 1:34:02.720
 we could have a war that no one could win and so the superpowers couldn't fight again they

1:34:02.720 --> 1:34:07.200
 couldn't do a real kinetic war they could do diplomatic wars and cold war type stuff and

1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:10.400
 they could fight proxy wars through other countries that didn't have the big weapons

1:34:11.040 --> 1:34:15.760
 and so mutually assured destruction and like coming out of world war two we actually realized

1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:22.000
 that nation states couldn't prevent world war and so we needed a new type of of supervening

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:25.840
 government in addition to nation states which was the whole bread and woods world the united

1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:33.520
 nations the world bank the imf the globalization trade type agreements mutually assured destruction

1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:38.080
 that was how do we have some coordination beyond just nation states between them

1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:43.920
 since we have to stop war between at least the superpowers and it was pretty successful

1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:48.080
 given that we've had like 75 years of no superpower on superpower war

1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:54.080
 we've had lots of proxy wars during that time we've had you know cold war

1:34:55.680 --> 1:35:02.000
 and i would say we're in a new phase now where the bread and wood solution is basically over

1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:09.200
 almost over you described the bread most solution yeah so the bread and woods the series of agreements

1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:17.680
 for how the nations would be able to engage with each other in a solution other than war

1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:24.560
 was these igos these intergovernmental organizations and was the idea of globalization

1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:27.600
 since we could have global effects we needed to be able to think about things globally

1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:32.880
 where we had trade relationships with each other where it would not be profitable to war with

1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:36.560
 each other be more profitable to actually be able to trade with each other so our own self

1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:44.000
 interest was you know going to drive our non more interest and so this started to look like

1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:48.560
 and obviously this this couldn't have happened that much earlier either because industrialization

1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:53.280
 hadn't gotten far enough to be able to do massive global industrial supply chains and ship stuff

1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:58.160
 around you know quickly but like we were mentioning earlier almost all the electronics that we

1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:03.040
 used today just basic cheap stuff for us is made on six continents made in many countries there's

1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:07.120
 no single country in the world that could actually make many of the things that we have and from the

1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:13.520
 raw material extraction to the plastics and polymers and the you know etc and so the idea

1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:19.040
 the idea that we made a world that could do that kind of trade and create massive gdp growth we

1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:25.200
 could all work together to be able to mine natural resources and grow stuff with the rapid gdp growth

1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:29.120
 there was the idea that everybody could keep having more without having to take each other's

1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:35.680
 stuff and so that that was part of kind of the the breton woods post world war two model the other

1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:39.600
 was that we would be so economically interdependent that blowing each other up would never make sense

1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:49.120
 that worked for a while now it also brought us up into planetary boundaries faster the

1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:54.640
 unrenovable use of resource and turning those resources into pollution on the other side of

1:36:54.640 --> 1:37:02.320
 the supply chain so obviously that faster gdp growth meant uh the overfishing of the oceans

1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:07.920
 and the cutting down of the trees and the climate change and the uh mining toxic mining tailings

1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:11.920
 going into the water and the mountaintop removal mining and all those types of things that's the

1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:18.000
 over consumption side of the of the risk that we're talking about and so the answer of let's do

1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:26.880
 positive gdp is the answer rapidly and exponentially obviously accelerated the planetary boundary side

1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:31.520
 and that started to be that that was thought about for a long time but it started to be modeled

1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:39.360
 with the club of rome and limits of growth um and it but it's just very obvious to say if you

1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:43.840
 have a linear materials economy where you take stuff out of the earth faster whether it's fish

1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:48.640
 or trees or or or and you take or oil and you take it out of the earth faster than it can replenish

1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:53.600
 itself and you turn it into trash after using it for a short period of time you put the trash

1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:58.240
 in the environment faster than it can process itself and there's toxicity associated with

1:37:58.240 --> 1:38:04.080
 both sides of this you can't run an exponentially growing linear materials economy on a finite

1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:09.040
 planet forever that's not a hard thing to figure out and it has to be exponential if there's an

1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:14.320
 exponentiation in the monetary supply because of interest and then fractional reserve banking

1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:18.080
 and to then be able to keep up with the growing monetary supply you have to have growth of goods

1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:25.680
 and services and so that's that kind of thing that has happened um but you also see that when

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:30.240
 you get these supply chains that are so interconnected across the world you get increased fragility

1:38:30.240 --> 1:38:34.880
 because a collapse or a problem in one area then affects the whole world in a much bigger area

1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:41.200
 as opposed to the issues being local right so we got to see with covid and an issue that started

1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:46.400
 in one part of china affecting the whole world so much more rapidly than would have happened

1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:51.680
 before breton woods right before international travel supply chains you know that whole kind of

1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:55.440
 thing and with a bunch of second and third order effects that people wouldn't have predicted okay we

1:38:55.440 --> 1:39:02.720
 have to stop certain kinds of travel because of viral contaminants but the countries doing agriculture

1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:06.720
 depend upon fertilizer they don't produce that is shipped into them and depend upon pesticides

1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:11.920
 they don't produce so we got both crop failures and crops being eaten by locusts in scale in

1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:15.200
 northern africa and iran and things like that because they couldn't get the supplies of stuff

1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:20.800
 in so then you get massive starvation or future kind of hunger issues because of supply chain

1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:26.160
 shutdowns so you get this increased fragility and cascade dynamics where a small problem can

1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:35.440
 end up leading to cascade effects and also we went from two superpowers with one catastrophe weapon

1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:45.280
 to now that same catastrophe weapon is there's more countries that have it eight or nine countries

1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:51.280
 that have it and there's a lot more types of catastrophe weapons we now have catastrophe

1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:56.400
 weapons with weaponized drones that can hit infrastructure targets with bio with in fact

1:39:56.400 --> 1:40:02.720
 every new type of tech has created an arms race so we have not with the un or the other kind of

1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:07.680
 intergovernmental organizations we haven't been able to really do nuclear deproliferation we've

1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:12.960
 actually had more countries get nukes and keep getting faster nukes the race to hypersonics and

1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:20.400
 things like that and every new type of technology that has emerged has created an arms race and so

1:40:21.280 --> 1:40:26.000
 you can't do mutually assured destruction with multiple agents the way you can with two agents

1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:32.080
 two agents it's a much easier to create a stable Nash equilibrium that's forced but the ability

1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:36.400
 to modern say if these guys shoot who do I shoot do I shoot them do I shoot everybody do I and so

1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:40.000
 you get a three body problem you get a very complex type of thing when you have multiple

1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:44.480
 agents and multiple different types of catastrophe weapons including ones that can be much more

1:40:44.480 --> 1:40:48.320
 easily produced than nukes nukes are really hard to produce there's only uranium in a few areas

1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:54.800
 uranium enrichment is hard ICBMs are hard but weaponized drones hitting smart targets is not

1:40:54.800 --> 1:40:58.640
 so hard there's a lot of other things where basically the scale at being able to manufacture

1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:04.320
 them is going way way down to where even non state actors can have them and so when we talk about

1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:10.960
 exponential tech and the decentralization of exponential tech what that means is decentralized

1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:16.880
 catastrophe weapon capacity and especially in a world of increasing numbers of people feeling

1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:25.440
 disenfranchised frantic whatever for different reasons so I would say where the Bretton Woods

1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:30.080
 world doesn't prepare us to be able to deal with lots of different agents having lots of different

1:41:30.080 --> 1:41:34.080
 types of catastrophe weapons you can't put mutually assured destruction on where you can't

1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:40.240
 keep doing growth of materials economy in the same way because of hitting planetary boundaries

1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:46.400
 and where the fragility dynamics are actually now their own source of catastrophic risk so now

1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:50.640
 we're so like there was all the world until world war two and world war two is just from a

1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:55.360
 from a civilization timescale point of view is just a second ago it seems like a long time but

1:41:55.360 --> 1:42:00.080
 it is really not we get a short period of relative peace at the level of superpowers while building

1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:06.160
 up the military capacity for much much much worse war the entire time and then now we're at this new

1:42:06.160 --> 1:42:11.680
 phase where the things that allowed us to make it through the nuclear power are not the same

1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:16.640
 systems that will let us make it through the next stage so what is this next post Bretton Woods

1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:26.080
 how how do we become safe vessels safe stewards of many different types of exponential technology

1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:35.520
 is a key question when we're thinking about ex risk okay so and I'd like to try to answer the

1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:43.200
 how a few a few ways but first on the mutually assured destruction do you give credit to the

1:42:43.200 --> 1:42:50.960
 idea of two superpowers not blowing each other up with nuclear weapons to the simple game

1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:57.360
 theoretic model of mutually assured destruction or something you've said previously this idea

1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:05.840
 of inverse correlation which I tend to believe between the now you were talking about tech but

1:43:05.840 --> 1:43:12.480
 I think it's maybe broadly true the inverse correlation between competence and propensity

1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:21.760
 for destruction so the better the the bigger your weapons not because you're afraid of mutually

1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:28.560
 assured self destruction but because we're human beings and there's a deep moral fortitude there

1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:33.680
 that's somehow aligned with competence and being good at your job that like it's very hard to be

1:43:33.680 --> 1:43:46.880
 a psychopath and be good at killing at scale is do you share any of that intuition kind of

1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:53.360
 I think most people would say that Alexander the great and Genghis Khan and Napoleon were

1:43:53.360 --> 1:44:01.440
 effective people that were good at their job that were actually maybe asymmetrically good

1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:08.560
 at being able to organize people and do certain kinds of things that were pretty oriented towards

1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:14.320
 certain types of destruction or pretty willing to maybe they would say they were oriented towards

1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:18.720
 empire expansion but pretty willing to commit certain acts of destruction in the name of it

1:44:19.520 --> 1:44:25.680
 what are you worried about the Genghis Khan or you could argue he's not a psychopath

1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:32.080
 that are you worried about Genghis Khan are you worried about Hitler are you worried about

1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:43.040
 a terrorist who is has a very different ethic which is not even for it's not trying to preserve

1:44:43.040 --> 1:44:50.400
 and build and expand my community it's more about just the destruction in itself is the goal

1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:56.800
 I think the thing that you're looking at that I do agree with is that there's a psychological

1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:02.960
 disposition towards construction and a psychological disposition more towards destruction obviously

1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:08.800
 everybody has both and can toggle between both and oftentimes one is willing to destroy certain

1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:12.560
 things we have this idea of creative destruction right willing to destroy certain things to create

1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:17.920
 other things and utilitarianism and trolley problems are all about exploring that space

1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:23.120
 and the idea of war is all about that I am trying to create something for our people

1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:24.800
 and it requires destroying some other people

1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:33.680
 sociopathy is a funny topic because it's possible to have very high fealty to your in group and

1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:38.880
 work on perfecting the methods of torture to the out group at the same time because you can

1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:50.160
 dehumanize and then remove empathy and I would also say that there are types so the reason the

1:45:50.160 --> 1:45:55.600
 thing that gives hope about the orientation towards construction and destruction being a little

1:45:55.600 --> 1:46:02.240
 different in psychology is what it takes to build really catastrophic tech even today where it

1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:07.440
 doesn't take what it took to make a new small group people could do it takes still some real

1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:14.000
 technical knowledge that required having studied for a while and some in building capacity and

1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:19.040
 there's a question of is that psychologically inversely correlated with the desire to

1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:29.680
 damage civilization meaningfully a little bit a little bit I think I think a lot I think it's

1:46:29.680 --> 1:46:34.880
 actually I mean this is the conversation I had like what I think offline with Dan Carlin

1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:42.400
 which is like it's pretty easy to come up with ways that any competent I can come up with a lot

1:46:42.400 --> 1:46:48.240
 of ways to hurt a lot of people and it's pretty easy like I alone could do it and

1:46:50.640 --> 1:46:56.960
 like there's a lot of people as smarter smarter than me at least in their creation of explosives

1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:07.440
 why are we not seeing more insane mass murder I think there's something fascinating and beautiful

1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:13.840
 about this yes and it does have to do with some deeply pro social types of characteristics in

1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:22.080
 humans and but when you're dealing with very large numbers you don't need a whole lot of a

1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:26.800
 phenomena and so then you start to say well what's the probability that x won't happen this year

1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:31.600
 then won't happen in the next two years three years four years and then how many people are

1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:35.840
 doing destructive things with lower tech and then how many of them can get access to higher

1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:44.080
 tech that they didn't have to figure out how to build so when I can get commercial tech and maybe

1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:49.360
 I don't understand tech very well but I understand it well enough to utilize it not to create it

1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:56.080
 and I can repurpose it when we saw that commercial drone with a homemade thermite bomb hit the

1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:01.520
 Ukraine Ukrainian munitions factory and do the equivalent of an incendiary bomb level of damage

1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:09.360
 that's just home tech that's just simple kind of thing and so the question is not

1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:16.000
 what is does it stay being a small percentage of the population the question is does can you

1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:24.640
 bind that phenomena nearly completely and especially now when you as you start to get

1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:31.440
 into bigger things crisper gene drive technologies and various things like that can you bind it

1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:38.000
 completely long term over what period of time not perfectly though that's the thing I'm trying

1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:46.800
 I'm trying to say that there is some let's call it that's a random word love that's inherent in

1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:55.680
 that's core to human nature that's preventing destruction at scale and you're saying yeah

1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:01.040
 but there's a lot of humans there's going to be eight plus billion and then there's a lot of seconds

1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:06.560
 in the day to come up with stuff there's a lot of pain in the world that can lead to a distorted

1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:10.960
 view of the world such that you want to channel that pain into the destruction all those kinds

1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:15.840
 of things and it's only a matter of time that anyone individual could do large damage especially as

1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:23.040
 we create more and more democratized decentralized ways to deliver that damage even if you don't

1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:30.480
 know how to build the initial weapon you can but the thing is it seems like it's a race between

1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:40.960
 the cheapening of destructive weapons and the capacity of humans to express their love

1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:50.080
 towards each other and it's a race that so far I know on Twitter it's not popular to say but love

1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:57.360
 is winning okay so what is the argument that love is going to lose here against nuclear weapons of

1:49:57.360 --> 1:50:07.280
 biotech and and AI and and drones okay I'm gonna come at the end of this to a how love wins so I

1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:12.240
 just want you to know that that's where I'm oriented that's the end but I'm I'm gonna argue

1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:20.800
 against why that is a given because it because it's not a given I don't believe and I think this

1:50:20.800 --> 1:50:26.160
 is like a good romantic comedy so you're gonna create drama right now but it will end with a

1:50:26.160 --> 1:50:30.400
 happy ending well it's because it's only a happy ending if we actually understand the issues well

1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:34.960
 enough and take responsibility to shift it do I believe like there's a reason why there's so much

1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:41.200
 more dystopic sci fi than protopic sci fi and the in the sum protopic sci fi usually requires magic

1:50:41.840 --> 1:50:49.280
 is because or at least magical tech right dilithium crystals and warp drives and stuff

1:50:49.280 --> 1:50:54.960
 because it's very hard to imagine people like the people we have been in the history books

1:50:56.480 --> 1:51:04.080
 with exponential type technology and power that don't eventually blow themselves up that

1:51:04.080 --> 1:51:09.040
 make good enough choices as stewards of their environment and their commons and and each other

1:51:09.040 --> 1:51:13.440
 and etc so like it's easier to think of scenarios where we blow ourselves up than it is to think

1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:17.120
 of scenarios where we avoid every single scenario where we blow ourselves up and when I say blow

1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:22.640
 ourselves up I also I mean the environmental versions the terrorist versions the war versions

1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:30.400
 the cumulative externalities versions um can I and I'm sorry if I'm interrupting your flow of

1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:36.880
 thought but why is it easier is it could it be a weird psychological thing where we either I'm

1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:42.800
 just more capable to visualize explosions and destruction and then the sicker thought which

1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:47.440
 is like we kind of enjoy for some weird reason thinking about that kind of stuff even though we

1:51:47.440 --> 1:51:53.440
 wouldn't actually act on it it's almost like some weird uh like I love playing shooter games

1:51:53.440 --> 1:51:58.960
 you know uh first person shooters and like especially if it's like murdering zombie and doom

1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:05.200
 you're shooting demons I play one of my favorite games diabolus like slashing through different

1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:11.120
 monsters and the screaming and pain and the hellfire and then I go out into the real world uh to eat

1:52:11.120 --> 1:52:17.440
 my coconut ice cream and I'm all about love so I got that can we trust our ability to visualize

1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:24.560
 how all it all goes to shit as an actual rational way of thinking I think it's a fair question to

1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:32.320
 say to what degree is there just kind of perverse fantasy and um morbid exploration and whatever

1:52:32.320 --> 1:52:38.640
 else that happens in our imagination uh but I don't think that's the whole of it I think there is

1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:45.120
 also a reality to the combinatorial possibility space and the difference in the probabilities

1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:51.280
 that there's a lot of ways I could try to put the 70 trillion cells of your body together that don't

1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:56.000
 make you there's not that many ways I can put them together that make you there's a lot of ways I

1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:01.600
 could try to connect the organs together that make some weird kind of group of organs on a on a

1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:07.920
 desk but that doesn't actually make a functioning human and and you can kill an adult human in a

1:53:07.920 --> 1:53:12.320
 second but you can't get one in a second takes 20 years to grow one and a lot of things to happen

1:53:12.320 --> 1:53:18.800
 right I could destroy this building in a couple minutes with demolition but it took a year or

1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:25.920
 a couple years to build it there is uh I'm down cold this is just an example it's not he doesn't

1:53:25.920 --> 1:53:35.040
 mean it there's a there's a gradient where entropy is easier and there's a lot more ways to put a

1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:39.280
 set of things together that don't work than the few that really do produce higher order synergies

1:53:39.280 --> 1:53:51.200
 and so when we look at a history of war and then we look at exponentially more powerful warfare

1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:55.040
 norm's race it drives out in all these directions and when we look at a history of environmental

1:53:55.040 --> 1:53:59.280
 destruction and exponentially more powerful tech that makes exponential externalities

1:53:59.280 --> 1:54:02.640
 multiplied by the total number of agents that are doing it in the cumulative effects

1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:08.320
 there's a lot of ways the whole thing can break like a lot of different ways and for it to get

1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:15.520
 ahead it has to have none of those happen and so there's just a probability space where it's easier

1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:21.120
 to imagine that thing so what so to say how do we have a protopic future we have to say well

1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:27.040
 one criteria must be that it avoids all of the catastrophic risks so can we understand can we

1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:31.120
 inventory all the catastrophic risk can we inventory the patterns of human behavior that give rise to

1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:38.000
 them and could we try to solve for that and could we have that be the the essence of the social

1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:42.160
 technology that we're thinking about to be able to guide bind and direct a new physical

1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:47.120
 technology because so far our physical technology like we were talking about the Genghis Khan's

1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:52.800
 and like that that obviously use certain kinds of physical technology and armaments and also

1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:58.560
 social technology and unconventional warfare for a particular set of purposes but we have things

1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:05.920
 that don't look like warfare like Rockefeller and Standard Oil and it looked like a constructive

1:55:05.920 --> 1:55:14.400
 mindset to be able to bring this new energy resource to the world and it did and the second

1:55:14.400 --> 1:55:22.080
 order effects of that are climate change and all of the oil spills that have happened and will

1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:29.200
 happen and all of the wars in the Middle East over the oil that have been there and the massive

1:55:29.200 --> 1:55:36.640
 political clusterfuck and human life issues that are associated with it and on and on right and so

1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:44.640
 it's also not just the orientation to construct a thing can have a narrow focus on what I'm trying

1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:48.560
 to construct but be affecting a lot of other things through second and third order effects I'm not

1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:55.920
 taking responsibility for and you often another tangent mentioned second third and fourth order

1:55:55.920 --> 1:56:03.120
 effects and order and and fascinating which is really fascinating like starting with the third

1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:10.720
 order plus it gets really interesting because we don't we don't even acknowledge like the second

1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:16.240
 order effects right but like thinking because those it could map it could get bigger and bigger

1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:21.280
 and bigger in ways we're not anticipating so how do we make those so it sounds like part of the

1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:29.200
 part of the thing that you are thinking through in terms of a solution how to create an anti

1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:39.600
 fragile a resilient society is to make explicit acknowledge understand the externalities the

1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:46.000
 second order third order fourth order and the order effects how do we start to think about those

1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:51.440
 effects yeah the war application is harm we're trying to cause or that we're aware we're causing

1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:57.280
 right the externality is harm that at least supposedly we're not aware we're causing or

1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:01.760
 at minimum it's not our intention right maybe we're either totally unaware of it or we're aware

1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:05.440
 of it but it is a side effect of what our intention is it's not the intention itself

1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:11.760
 there are catastrophic risks from both types the direct application of increased technological

1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:18.800
 power to a rival risk intent which is going to cause harm for some out group for some in group

1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:23.920
 to win but the out group is also working on growing the tech and if they don't lose completely they

1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:29.760
 reverse engineer the tech up regulated come back with more capacity so there's the exponential tech

1:57:29.760 --> 1:57:35.520
 arms race side of in group out group rivalry using exponential tech that is one set of risks

1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:43.840
 and the other set of risks is the application of exponentially more powerful tech not intentionally

1:57:44.400 --> 1:57:49.440
 to try and beat an out group but to try to achieve some goal that we have but to produce a second

1:57:49.440 --> 1:57:56.480
 and third order effects that do have harm to the commons to other people to environment to other

1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:02.960
 groups that might actually be bigger problems than the problem we were originally trying to

1:58:02.960 --> 1:58:09.360
 solve with the thing we were building when facebook was building a dating app and then

1:58:09.360 --> 1:58:16.000
 building a social app where people could tag pictures they weren't trying to build a democracy

1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:25.600
 destroying app uh that would maximize time on site as part of its ad model through ai

1:58:25.600 --> 1:58:30.160
 optimization of a news feed to the thing that made people spend most time on site which is usually

1:58:30.160 --> 1:58:35.280
 them being limbically hijacked more than something else which ends up appealing to people's cognitive

1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:40.640
 biases and group identities and creates no sense of shared reality they weren't trying to do that

1:58:40.640 --> 1:58:46.560
 but it was a second order effect and it's a pretty fucking powerful second order effect

1:58:48.480 --> 1:58:53.280
 and a pretty fast one because the rate of tech is obviously able to get distributed to much larger

1:58:53.280 --> 1:58:59.200
 scale much faster and with a bigger jump in terms of total vertical capacity then that's what it

1:58:59.200 --> 1:59:06.320
 means to get to the verticalizing part of an exponential curve so um just like we can see

1:59:06.320 --> 1:59:11.200
 that oil had these second order environmental effects and also social and political effects

1:59:11.200 --> 1:59:19.040
 war and so much of the whole like the total amount of oil used is has a proportionality to

1:59:19.040 --> 1:59:27.440
 total global GDP and this way we have this you know the petrodollar and um and so the the oil

1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:31.680
 thing also had the externalities of a major aspect of what happened with military industrial

1:59:31.680 --> 1:59:37.760
 complex and things like that so but we can see the same thing with with more current technologies

1:59:37.760 --> 1:59:45.680
 with facebook and google um and and other things so i don't think we can run and the more powerful

1:59:45.680 --> 1:59:52.400
 the tech is we build it for reason x whatever reason x is maybe x is three things maybe it's

1:59:52.400 --> 1:59:58.160
 one thing right we we're doing the oil thing because we want to make cars because it's a

1:59:58.160 --> 2:00:01.280
 better method of individual transportation we're building the facebook thing because we're going

2:00:01.280 --> 2:00:07.840
 to connect people socially in the personal sphere but it it interacts with it interacts with complex

2:00:07.840 --> 2:00:14.560
 systems with ecologies economies psychologies cultures and so it has effects on other than the

2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:20.320
 thing we're intending some of those effects can end up being negative effects but because this

2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:26.240
 technology if if we make it to solve a problem it has to overcome the problem the problem's been

2:00:26.240 --> 2:00:29.520
 around for a while it's going to overcome in a short period of time so it usually has greater

2:00:29.520 --> 2:00:35.360
 scale greater rate of magnitude in some way that also means that the externalities that it creates

2:00:35.360 --> 2:00:40.320
 might be bigger problems and you can say well but then that's the new problem and humanity will

2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:44.400
 innovate its way out of that well i don't think that's paying attention to the fact that we can't

2:00:44.400 --> 2:00:50.560
 keep up with exponential curves like that nor do finite spaces allow exponential externalities

2:00:50.560 --> 2:00:56.800
 forever and this is why a lot of the smartest people thinking about this are thinking well

2:00:57.520 --> 2:01:02.160
 no i think we're totally screwed and unless we can make a benevolent ai singleton that

2:01:02.160 --> 2:01:07.840
 rules all of us um you know guys like boss drum and and others uh thinking in those directions

2:01:07.840 --> 2:01:15.600
 because they're like how do humans try to do multi polarity and make it work and i i have a

2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:20.800
 different answer of what i think it looks like that does have more to do with the love but some

2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:26.400
 applied social tech aligning aligned with love because i have a bunch of really dumb ideas i

2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:31.440
 prefer to uh i'd like to hear i'd like to hear some of them first i think the idea i would have is

2:01:31.440 --> 2:01:41.280
 uh to be a bit more rigorous in trying to measure the amount of love you add or subtract from the

2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:48.720
 world in second third fourth fifth order effects it's actually i think especially in the world of

2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:56.640
 tech quite doable you know you just might not like you know the the shareholders may not like

2:01:56.640 --> 2:02:04.960
 that kind of metric but it's pretty easy to measure like that's not even uh um perhaps half

2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:09.600
 joking about love but we could talk about just happiness and well being long term well being

2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:14.960
 that's pretty easy from facebook for youtube for all these companies to measure that

2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:21.040
 they do a lot of kinds of surveys they could do i mean there's very simple solutions here

2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:27.440
 that you can just survey how i mean servers are in some sense use useless because they're um

2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:34.240
 a subset of the population you're just trying to get a sense it's very loose kind of understanding

2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:39.920
 but integrated deeply as part of the technology most of our tech is recommender systems most of the

2:02:39.920 --> 2:02:47.520
 sorry not tech uh online interaction is driven by recommender systems that learn very little data

2:02:47.520 --> 2:02:52.960
 about you and use that data based on mostly based on traces of your previous behavior to

2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:59.440
 suggest future things this is how twitter this is facebook works this is how uh adsense for google

2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:04.960
 adsense works is how netflix youtube work and so on and and for them to just track as opposed to

2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:12.880
 engagement how much you spend in a particular video particular site is also track give you the

2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:18.480
 technology to do self report of what makes you feel good of what makes you grow as a person

2:03:19.360 --> 2:03:28.880
 of what makes you uh you know the best version of yourself the the the the rogan uh idea of

2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:35.600
 the hero of your movie and just add that little bit of information if you you have people you have

2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:41.840
 this like happiness surveys of how you feel about the last five days how would you report

2:03:41.840 --> 2:03:46.160
 your experience you can lay out the set of videos this is kind of fascinating to me i don't know if

2:03:46.160 --> 2:03:51.200
 you ever look at youtube the history of videos you've looked at it's fascinating it's very embarrassing

2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:57.920
 for me like you'll be like a lecture and then like a set of videos that i don't want anyone to know

2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:04.160
 about which is which is which will be like uh i don't know maybe like five videos in a row where

2:04:04.160 --> 2:04:08.240
 it looks like i watched the whole thing which i probably did i bought like how to cook a steak

2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:12.880
 even though or just like the best chefs in the world cooking steaks and i'm just like

2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:18.640
 sitting there watching it for no purpose whatsoever wasting away my life or like funny

2:04:18.640 --> 2:04:25.680
 cat videos or like legit that doesn't that's always a good one and i could look back and rate

2:04:25.680 --> 2:04:32.480
 which videos made me a better person and not and i mean on a more serious note there's a bunch of

2:04:32.480 --> 2:04:37.840
 conversations podcasts or lectures i've watched which made me a better person and some of them

2:04:37.840 --> 2:04:44.720
 made me a worse person uh quite honestly not for stupid reasons like i feel dumber but because i do

2:04:44.720 --> 2:04:54.880
 have a sense that that started me on a path of um of not being kind to other people for example

2:04:54.880 --> 2:04:59.680
 i'll give you uh for my own and i'm sorry for rantic but maybe there's some usefulness to this

2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:08.800
 kind of exploration of self when i focus on creating on programming on science i'd become

2:05:09.520 --> 2:05:16.400
 a much deeper thinker and a kinder person to others when i listen to too many a little bit

2:05:16.400 --> 2:05:25.760
 is good but too many podcasts or videos about how how our world is melting down or criticizing

2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:31.520
 ridiculous people the worst of the quote unquote woke for example all there's all these groups

2:05:32.080 --> 2:05:38.000
 that are misbehaving in fascinating ways because they've been corrupted by power the more i what

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:46.960
 the more i watch criticism of them the worse i become and i'm aware of this but i'm also aware

2:05:46.960 --> 2:05:53.520
 that for some reason it's pleasant to watch those sometimes and so for for me to be able to self

2:05:53.520 --> 2:05:59.600
 report that to the youtube algorithm to the systems around me and they ultimately try to optimize to

2:05:59.600 --> 2:06:05.360
 make me the best person the best version of myself which i personally believe would make youtube a

2:06:05.360 --> 2:06:09.360
 lot more money because i'd be much more willing to spend time i need to have been given youtube a

2:06:09.360 --> 2:06:16.080
 lot more a lot more of my money that's uh that's great for business and great for humanity because

2:06:16.080 --> 2:06:24.320
 it'll make me a kinder person it'll increase the the love quotient the love metric and uh it'll

2:06:24.320 --> 2:06:28.880
 make them a lot of money i feel like everything's aligned and so you you should do that not just

2:06:28.880 --> 2:06:33.600
 for youtube algorithm but also for military strategy and for this to go to war or not

2:06:33.600 --> 2:06:39.920
 because one externality you can think of about going to war which i think we talked about offline

2:06:39.920 --> 2:06:46.400
 is we often go to war with kind of governments with uh with not with the people you have to think

2:06:46.400 --> 2:06:58.320
 about the kids of countries that see a soldier and because of what they experience the interaction

2:06:58.320 --> 2:07:04.960
 with the soldier hate is born when you're like eight years old six years old you lose your dad

2:07:04.960 --> 2:07:11.760
 you lose your mom you lose a friend somebody close to you that want a really powerful externality

2:07:11.760 --> 2:07:18.000
 that could be reduced to love positive and negative is uh the hate that's born when you

2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:25.040
 make decisions and that's going to take fruition that that little seed is going to become a tree

2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:32.560
 that then leads to the kind of destruction that we talk about uh so but in my sense it's possible

2:07:32.560 --> 2:07:36.160
 to reduce everything to a measure of how much love does this add to the world

2:07:38.480 --> 2:07:45.280
 all that to say uh do you have ideas of how we practically uh build systems

2:07:46.080 --> 2:07:51.760
 that that that create a resilient society there are a lot of good things that you shared where

2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:57.600
 there's like 15 different ways that we could enter this that are all interesting so i'm

2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:02.160
 trying to see which one will probably be most useful pick the uh the one or two things that are

2:08:02.160 --> 2:08:10.560
 least ridiculous when you're mentioning if we could see some of the second order effects

2:08:10.560 --> 2:08:15.040
 or externalities that we aren't used to seeing specifically the one of a kid being radicalized

2:08:15.040 --> 2:08:20.080
 somewhere else which engenders enmity and them towards us which decreases our own future security

2:08:20.080 --> 2:08:25.680
 even if you don't care about the kid if you care about the kids the whole other thing um yeah i mean

2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:31.920
 i think when we saw this when jane fonda and others went to vietnam and took photos and videos

2:08:31.920 --> 2:08:38.080
 of what was happening and you got to see the pictures of the kids with napalm on them uh that

2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:43.520
 like the anti war effort was bolstered by that in a way it couldn't have been without that there's

2:08:43.520 --> 2:08:50.240
 there's a until we can see the images you can't have a mere neuron effect in the same way and when

2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:55.200
 you can that starts to have a powerful effect i think there's a deep principle that you're

2:08:55.200 --> 2:09:05.680
 sharing there which is that if we we can have a rivalrous intent where our in group whatever

2:09:05.680 --> 2:09:11.120
 it is maybe it's our political party wanting to win within the us maybe it's our nation state wanting

2:09:11.120 --> 2:09:18.080
 to win in a a war or an economic war over resource or whatever it is that if we don't obliterate the

2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:23.920
 other people completely they don't go away they're they're not engendered to like us more

2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:29.120
 or they're they didn't become less smart so they have more enmity towards us and whatever

2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:34.160
 technologies we employed to be successful they will now reverse engineer make iterations on

2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:41.760
 and come back and so you you drive in arms race which is why you can see that the wars were over

2:09:41.760 --> 2:09:50.640
 history employing more lethal weaponry and not just the kinetic war um the information war and

2:09:50.640 --> 2:09:56.560
 the narrative war and the economic war right like it just increased capacity in all of those fronts

2:09:58.160 --> 2:10:04.480
 and so what seems like a win to us on the short term might actually really produce losses in the

2:10:04.480 --> 2:10:08.720
 long term and what's even in our own best interest in the long term is probably more aligned with

2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:13.120
 everyone else because we inter affect each other and i think the thing about globalism

2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:18.080
 globalization and exponential tech and the rate at which we affect each other and the rate at which

2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:25.360
 we affect the biosphere that we're all affected by is that this this kind of proverbial spiritual

2:10:25.360 --> 2:10:30.800
 idea that we're all interconnected and need to think about that in some way that was easy for

2:10:30.800 --> 2:10:36.000
 tribes to get because everyone in the tribe so clearly saw their interconnection independence

2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:43.600
 on each other but in terms of a global level the the speed at which we are actually interconnected

2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:49.040
 the speed at which the harm happening to something in Wuhan affects the rest of the world or a new

2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:52.880
 technology developed somewhere affects the entire world or an environmental issue or whatever

2:10:53.600 --> 2:10:59.360
 is making it to where we either actually all get not as a spiritual idea just even as physics right

2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:04.400
 we all get the interconnectedness of everything and that we either all consider that and see how

2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:10.480
 to make it through more effectively together or failures anywhere in that becoming decreased

2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:14.160
 quality of life and failures and increased risk everywhere don't you think people are beginning

2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:18.640
 to experience that at the individual level so governments are resisting it they're they're

2:11:18.640 --> 2:11:22.480
 trying to make us not empathize with each other feel connected but don't you think people are

2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:27.600
 beginning to feel more and more connected like isn't that exactly what the technology is enabling

2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:35.120
 like social networks we tend to criticize them but isn't there a sense which we're experiencing you

2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:42.560
 know yeah when you watch those videos that are criticizing whether it's the woke antifa side

2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:49.680
 or the QAnon Trump supporter side does it seem like they have increased empathy for people

2:11:49.680 --> 2:11:57.440
 that are outside of their ideologic camp not at all so I may be I may be conflating my own

2:11:57.440 --> 2:12:06.080
 experience of the world and that of that of the populace I I tend to see those videos

2:12:08.320 --> 2:12:16.480
 as feeding something that's a relic of the past they figured out that drama fuels clicks but

2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:24.800
 whether I'm right or wrong I don't know but I tend to sense that that is not that hunger for drama

2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:33.120
 is not fundamental to human beings that we want to actually that we want to understand antifa

2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:39.200
 and we want to like empathize we want to take radical ideas and be able to empathize with them

2:12:39.840 --> 2:12:50.160
 and synthesize it all okay let's look at cultural outliers in terms of violence versus

2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:57.600
 compassion we can see that a lot of cultures have relatively lower in group violence bigger

2:12:57.600 --> 2:13:01.440
 out group violence and there's some variants in them in variants of different times based on the

2:13:01.440 --> 2:13:09.440
 scarcity or abundance of resource and other things but you can look at say Jains whose whole

2:13:09.440 --> 2:13:14.800
 religion is around nonviolent so much so that they don't even hurt plants they only take fruits that

2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:20.800
 fall off them and stuff or to go to a larger population you take Buddhists where for the most

2:13:20.800 --> 2:13:25.360
 part with a few exceptions for the most part across three millennia and across lots of

2:13:25.360 --> 2:13:30.480
 different countries and geographies and whatever you have 10 million people plus or minus who don't

2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:36.400
 hurt bugs the whole spectrum of genetic variants that is happening within a culture of that many

2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:43.680
 people um and head traumas and whatever and nobody hurts bugs and then you look at a group where

2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:48.880
 the kids grew up as child soldiers and Liberia or Darfur were to make it to adulthood pretty much

2:13:48.880 --> 2:13:54.320
 everybody's killed people hand to hand and killed people who were civilian or innocent type of people

2:13:55.200 --> 2:14:00.560
 and you say okay so we were very in the oddness we can be conditioned by our environment and humans

2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:06.320
 can be conditioned where almost all the humans show up in these two different bell curves it

2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:09.760
 doesn't mean that the buddhas had no violence it doesn't mean that these people had no compassion

2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:17.040
 but the they're very different Gaussian distributions and so I think one of the important

2:14:17.040 --> 2:14:23.840
 things that I like to do is look at the examples of the populations what Buddhism shows regarding

2:14:23.840 --> 2:14:30.800
 compassion or what Judaism shows around education the average level of education that everybody

2:14:30.800 --> 2:14:35.520
 gets because of a culture that is really working on conditioning it or various cultures what are

2:14:35.520 --> 2:14:42.720
 the positive deviants outside of this statistical deviance to see what is actually possible and

2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:47.680
 then say what are the conditioning factors and can we condition those across a few of them

2:14:47.680 --> 2:14:53.280
 simultaneously and could we build a civilization like that becomes a very interesting question

2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:59.680
 so there's this kind of real politic idea that humans are violent large groups of humans become

2:15:00.400 --> 2:15:03.840
 violent they become irrational specifically those two things rivalrous and violent and

2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:08.800
 irrational and so in order to minimize the total amount of violence and have some good decisions

2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:14.240
 they need ruled somehow and that not getting that as some kind of naive utopianism that doesn't

2:15:14.240 --> 2:15:18.960
 understand human nature yet this gets back to like mimesis of desire as an inexorable thing

2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:27.280
 I think the idea of the masses is actually a kind of propaganda that is useful for the classes that

2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:38.080
 control to popularize the idea that most people are too violent lazy undisciplined and irrational

2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:43.760
 to make good choices and therefore their choices should be sublimated in some kind of way I think

2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:51.120
 that if we look back at these conditioning environments we can say okay so the kids that

2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:58.720
 go to a really fancy school and have a good developmental environment like exeter academy

2:15:59.440 --> 2:16:03.280
 there's still a Gaussian distribution of how well they do on any particular metric

2:16:03.280 --> 2:16:09.040
 but on average they become senators and the worst ones become high end lawyers or whatever

2:16:09.040 --> 2:16:12.720
 and then I look at the inner city school with a totally different set of things and I see a very

2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:16.240
 very differently displaced Gaussian distribution but a very different set of conditioning factors

2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:20.640
 so then I say the masses well if all those kids who were one of the parts of the masses got to go

2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:26.000
 to exeter and have that family and whatever would they still be the masses um could we actually

2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:33.360
 condition more social virtue more civic virtue more orientation towards dialectical synthesis

2:16:33.360 --> 2:16:43.120
 more empathy more rationality widely yes would that lead to better capacity for something like

2:16:43.120 --> 2:16:47.840
 participatory governance democracy or republic or some kind of participatory governance

2:16:47.840 --> 2:16:57.840
 or yes is it necessary for it actually yes and is it good for class interests not not really

2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:03.520
 by the way when you say class interest this is the powerful leading over the the less

2:17:03.520 --> 2:17:11.120
 powerful that kind of idea anyone that benefits from asymmetries of power doesn't necessarily

2:17:11.120 --> 2:17:17.040
 benefit from decreasing those asymmetries of power and you kind of increasing the capacity

2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:26.800
 of people more widely and um so when we talk about power we're talking about asymmetries

2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:32.560
 and agency influence and control you think that hunger for power is fundamental to human nature

2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:37.760
 I think we should get that straight before we talk about other stuff so like uh this uh

2:17:38.720 --> 2:17:44.000
 this this pickup line that I use at a bar off which is uh power crops and absolute power crops

2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:50.400
 absolutely is that true or is that just a fancy thing to say in modern society they get there's

2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:56.560
 something to be said have we changed as societies over time in terms of how much we crave power

2:17:57.840 --> 2:18:03.360
 that there is an impulse towards power that is innate in people and can be conditioned one

2:18:03.360 --> 2:18:07.520
 way or the other yes but you can see that buddhist society does a very different thing with it at

2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:14.960
 scale that you don't end up seeing the emergence of the same types of sociopathic behavior

2:18:15.920 --> 2:18:25.440
 and particularly then creating sociopathic institutions um and so it's like is eating

2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:29.520
 the foods that were rare in our evolutionary environment to give us more dopamine hit because

2:18:29.520 --> 2:18:34.320
 they were rare and they're not anymore salt fat sugar um is there something pleasurable

2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:39.520
 about those where humans have an orientation to overeat if they can well the fact that there is

2:18:39.520 --> 2:18:43.760
 that possibility doesn't mean everyone will obligately be obese and I have obesity right

2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:50.160
 like it's possible to have a particular impulse and to be able to understand it have other ones

2:18:50.160 --> 2:18:59.280
 and be able to balance them and so to say that um power dynamics are are obligate in humans and

2:18:59.280 --> 2:19:04.240
 we can't do anything about it is very similar to me to saying like we could everyone is going

2:19:04.240 --> 2:19:09.440
 to be obligately obese yeah so there's some degree to which those the control those impulses

2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:14.880
 has to do with the conditioning early in life yes and the culture that creates the environment

2:19:14.880 --> 2:19:21.520
 to be able to do that and then the recursion on that okay so what if we were to uh bear with me

2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:29.680
 just asking for a friend if we're to kill all humans on earth and then start over is their

2:19:29.680 --> 2:19:35.120
 ideas about how to build up okay we don't have to kill let's leave the humans on earth they're fine

2:19:35.120 --> 2:19:42.720
 and go to mars and start a new society is there ways to construct systems of conditioning education

2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:53.520
 of how we live with each other that would um that would incentivize us properly to not seek

2:19:53.520 --> 2:20:01.040
 power not to not construct systems that are of asymmetry of power and to create systems that

2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:07.280
 are resilient to all kinds of terrorist attacks to the all kinds of destructions i believe so

2:20:07.280 --> 2:20:13.280
 so is there some inclinings we get of course you probably don't have the all the answers but you

2:20:13.280 --> 2:20:18.080
 have insights about what that looks like i mean yeah is it just rigorous practice of

2:20:18.080 --> 2:20:25.360
 dialectic synthesis as essentially conversations with assholes of various flavors until they're

2:20:25.360 --> 2:20:29.120
 not assholes anymore because you've become a deeply empathetic with their experience

2:20:29.120 --> 2:20:37.360
 okay so there's a lot of things that we would need to construct to come back to this like

2:20:37.360 --> 2:20:43.920
 what is the basis of rivalry what how do you bind it how does it relate to tech if you have a

2:20:43.920 --> 2:20:49.040
 culture that is doing less rivalry does it always lose in war to those who do war better and how

2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:54.160
 do you make something on the enactment of how to get there from here um great great so what's

2:20:54.160 --> 2:21:01.280
 rivalry well is rivalry bad or good is so is another word for rivalry competition

2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:11.040
 yes i think roughly yes i think bad and good are kind of silly concepts here good for some

2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:18.400
 things bad for other things for resilience contexts and others even that um okay let me give you

2:21:18.400 --> 2:21:22.240
 an example that relates back to the facebook measuring thing you were mentioning a moment ago

2:21:22.240 --> 2:21:27.680
 so first i think what you're saying is actually aligned with the right direction and what i want

2:21:27.680 --> 2:21:34.240
 to get to in a moment but it's not the devil is in the details here so i i enjoy praise

2:21:34.240 --> 2:21:39.600
 it feeds my ego i grow stronger so i appreciate that i will make sure to include one piece every

2:21:39.600 --> 2:21:52.800
 15 minutes as we go thank you so it's easier to measure their problems with this argument but

2:21:52.800 --> 2:21:56.640
 there's also utility to it so let's take it for the utility it has first

2:21:59.040 --> 2:22:01.840
 it's harder to measure happiness than it is to measure comfort

2:22:01.840 --> 2:22:10.480
 uh we can measure with technology that the shocks in a car making the car bounce less

2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:17.200
 that the bed is um softer and you know material science and those types of things and happiness

2:22:17.200 --> 2:22:23.360
 is actually hard for philosophers to define because some people find that there's certain

2:22:23.360 --> 2:22:27.040
 kinds of overcoming suffering that are necessary for happiness there's happiness it feels more

2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:31.120
 like contentment and happiness it feels more like passion does is passion the source of all

2:22:31.120 --> 2:22:35.360
 suffering or the source of all creativity like the there's deep stuff and it's mostly first

2:22:35.360 --> 2:22:40.160
 person not measurable third person stuff even if maybe it corresponds to third person stuff to

2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:44.320
 some degree but we also see examples of some of our favorite examples as people who are in the

2:22:44.320 --> 2:22:48.080
 worst environments who end up finding happiness right where the third person stuff looks to be

2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:54.880
 less conducive and there's some victor frankle nelson mendela whatever um but it's pretty easy

2:22:54.880 --> 2:22:59.840
 to measure comfort it's pretty universal and i think we can see that the industrial revolution

2:22:59.840 --> 2:23:05.280
 started to replace happiness with comfort quite heavily as the thing it was optimizing for and

2:23:05.280 --> 2:23:09.680
 we can see that when increased comfort is given maybe because of the evolutionary disposition

2:23:10.240 --> 2:23:14.800
 that expending extra calories when for the majority of our history we didn't have extra

2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:21.920
 calories was not a safe thing to do who knows why um when extra comfort is given it's very

2:23:21.920 --> 2:23:27.760
 easy to take that path even if it's not the path that supports overall well being long term

2:23:27.760 --> 2:23:37.440
 and um so we can see that you know when you when you look at the techno optimist idea that we have

2:23:37.440 --> 2:23:42.000
 better lives than egyptian pharaohs and kings and whatever what they're largely looking at

2:23:42.720 --> 2:23:48.240
 is how comfortable our beds are and how comfortable the transportation systems are and things like

2:23:48.240 --> 2:23:52.640
 that in which case there's massive improvement but we also see that in some of the nations where

2:23:52.640 --> 2:23:57.680
 people have access to the most comfort suicide and mental illness are the highest and we also

2:23:57.680 --> 2:24:02.240
 see that some of the happiest cultures are actually some of the ones that are in materially

2:24:02.240 --> 2:24:08.000
 lame environments and so there's a very interesting question here and if i understand correctly you

2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:13.840
 do cold showers and joe rogan was talking about how he needs to do some fairly intensive kind of

2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:20.960
 um struggle that is a non comfort to actually induce being better as a person this concept of

2:24:20.960 --> 2:24:28.320
 hormesis that it's actually stressing an adaptive system that increases its adaptive capacity and

2:24:28.320 --> 2:24:33.760
 that there's something that the happiness of a system has something to do with its adaptive

2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:40.880
 capacity its overall resilience health well being which requires a decent bit of discomfort and yet

2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:46.400
 in the in the presence of the comfort solution it's very hard to not choose it and then as you're

2:24:46.400 --> 2:24:54.240
 choosing it regularly to actually down regulate your overall adaptive capacity and so when we

2:24:54.240 --> 2:25:02.080
 start saying can we make tech where we're measuring for the things that it produces beyond just the

2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:08.320
 measure of gdp or whatever particular measures look like the revenue generation or profit generation

2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:17.520
 of my business are all the meaningful things measurable and what are the right measures

2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:22.000
 and what are the externalities of optimizing for that measurement set what meaningful things

2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:26.080
 aren't included in that measurement set that might have their own externalities these are

2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:29.840
 some of the questions we actually have to take seriously yeah and we i think they're answerable

2:25:29.840 --> 2:25:35.680
 questions right progressively better not perfect right so like so first of all let me throw out

2:25:35.680 --> 2:25:40.960
 happiness and comfort out of the discussion those seem like useless the distinction so i

2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:45.440
 because i said they're useful well being is useful but i think i take it back

2:25:46.880 --> 2:25:55.360
 i'm i knew i proposed new metrics in this brainstorm session which is so one is like

2:25:56.240 --> 2:26:03.760
 personal growth which is intellectual growth i think we're able to make that concrete

2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:11.360
 for ourselves like you're a better person than you were a week ago or a worse person than you

2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:17.920
 were a week ago i think we can ourselves report that and and and understand what that means it's

2:26:17.920 --> 2:26:22.960
 this gray area and we try to define it but i think we humans are pretty good at that because we

2:26:22.960 --> 2:26:27.760
 have a sense an idealistic sense of the person we might be able to become we we all dream of

2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:33.200
 becoming a certain kind of person and i think we have a sense of getting closer and not towards

2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:38.080
 that person maybe this is not a great metric fine the other one is love actually

2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:45.680
 fuck if you're happy or not or you're comfortable or not how much love do you have towards your

2:26:45.680 --> 2:26:51.280
 fellow human beings i feel like if you try to optimize that and increasing that that's going to have

2:26:51.280 --> 2:26:59.920
 that's a good metric how many times a day sorry if i can make quantify how many times a day have you

2:26:59.920 --> 2:27:05.680
 thought positively of another human being just put that down as a number and increase that number

2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:13.600
 i think the process of saying okay so let's not take gdp or gdp per capita is the metric we

2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:18.400
 want to optimize for because gdp goes up during war and it goes up with more health care spending

2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:21.840
 from sicker people and various things that we wouldn't say correlate to quality of life

2:27:22.720 --> 2:27:28.000
 addiction drives gdp awesomely um by the way when i said growth i wasn't referring to gdp

2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:33.600
 i know i'm giving an example now of the primary metric we use and why it's not an adequate metric

2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:39.200
 and because we're exploring other ones so the idea of saying what would the metrics for a

2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:44.400
 good civilization be if i had to pick a set of metrics what would the best ones be if i was going

2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:51.280
 to optimize for those and then really try to run the thought experiment more deeply and say okay so

2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:57.360
 what happens if we optimize for that try to think through the first and second and third order effects

2:27:57.360 --> 2:28:02.560
 of what happens it's positive and then also say what negative things can happen from optimizing

2:28:02.560 --> 2:28:07.440
 that what actually matters that is not included in that or in that way of defining it because love

2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:12.240
 versus number of positive thoughts per day i could just make a long list of names and just

2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:17.200
 say positive thing about each one it's all very superficial not include animals with the rest of

2:28:17.200 --> 2:28:22.320
 life have a have a very shallow total amount of it but i'm optimizing the number and if i get some

2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:29.520
 credit for the number so the and this is when i said the model of reality isn't reality when you

2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:34.400
 make a set of metrics they were going to optimize for this whatever reality is that is not included

2:28:34.400 --> 2:28:39.920
 in those metrics can be the areas where harm occurs which is why i would say that wisdom is something

2:28:39.920 --> 2:28:52.640
 like the discernment that leads to right choices beyond what metrics based optimization would offer

2:28:54.560 --> 2:29:04.480
 yeah but another way to say that is wisdom is constantly expanding an evolving set of metrics

2:29:04.480 --> 2:29:10.080
 which means that there is something in you that is recognizing a new metric that's important that

2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:15.680
 isn't part of that metric set so there's a certain kind of connection discernment awareness

2:29:16.640 --> 2:29:21.120
 and this is an iterative game theory there's a girdles in completeness there right which is if

2:29:21.120 --> 2:29:25.040
 the system if the set of things is consistent it won't be complete so we're going to keep adding

2:29:25.040 --> 2:29:30.800
 to it which is why we were saying earlier i don't think it's not beautiful and especially if you

2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:34.240
 were just saying one of the metrics you want to optimize for at the individual level is becoming

2:29:34.240 --> 2:29:37.840
 right that we're becoming more well that's then becomes true for the civilization and our metrics

2:29:37.840 --> 2:29:42.800
 sets as well yeah and our definition of how to think about a meaningful life and a meaningful

2:29:42.800 --> 2:29:46.880
 civilization i can tell you what some of my favorite metrics are what's that

2:29:50.720 --> 2:29:55.440
 well love is obviously not a metric it's like you can bench yeah it's a good metric yeah i want

2:29:55.440 --> 2:30:04.400
 to optimize that across the entire population starting with infants um so in the same way that

2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:07.760
 love isn't a metric but you could make metrics that look at certain parts of it the thing i'm

2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:12.240
 about to say isn't a metric but it's a it's a consideration because i thought about this a lot

2:30:12.240 --> 2:30:18.800
 i don't think there is a metric a right one um i think that every metric by itself without this

2:30:18.800 --> 2:30:23.440
 thing we talked about of the continuous improvement becomes a paperclip maximizer i think that's why

2:30:23.440 --> 2:30:29.840
 why what the idea of false idol means in terms of the model of reality not being reality then

2:30:29.840 --> 2:30:34.320
 my sacred relationship is to reality itself which also binds me to the unknown forever

2:30:34.880 --> 2:30:39.520
 to the known but also to the unknown and there's a sense of sacredness connected to the unknown

2:30:39.520 --> 2:30:43.760
 that creates an epistemic humility that is always seeking not just to optimize the thing i know

2:30:43.760 --> 2:30:48.880
 but to learn new stuff and to be open to perceive reality directly so my model never becomes sacred

2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:56.560
 my model is useful my so the model can't be the false idol correct yeah and this is why the first

2:30:56.560 --> 2:31:01.200
 verse of the Tao Te Ching is the Tao that is nameable is not the eternal Tao the naming then

2:31:01.200 --> 2:31:04.960
 can become the source of the 10 000 things that if you get too carried away with it can actually

2:31:04.960 --> 2:31:10.640
 obscure you from paying attention to reality beyond in the models it sounds a lot a lot like

2:31:10.640 --> 2:31:16.720
 Steven Wolfram but in a different language much more poetic i can't imagine that no i'm referring

2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:22.480
 i'm joking but there's echoes of cellular phenomena which you can't name you can't construct a good

2:31:22.480 --> 2:31:29.520
 model cellular phenomena you can only watch in awe i apologize i'm distracting your train of thought

2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:33.600
 horribly and miserably making a difference by the way something robots aren't good at

2:31:34.320 --> 2:31:39.440
 and uh dealing with the uncertainty of uneven ground you've been okay so far you've been doing

2:31:39.440 --> 2:31:44.160
 wonderfully so what's your favorite metrics okay so i know you're not so i have a fascinating

2:31:44.160 --> 2:31:50.640
 so one metric and there are problems with this but one metric that i like to just as a thought

2:31:50.640 --> 2:31:57.680
 experiment to consider is because you're actually asking where i mean i know you ask your guests

2:31:58.320 --> 2:32:01.520
 about the meaning of life because ultimately when you're deciding when you're saying what is a

2:32:01.520 --> 2:32:07.280
 desirable civilization you can't answer that without answering what is a meaningful human life and

2:32:08.400 --> 2:32:12.160
 to say what is a good civilization because it's going to be in relationship to that

2:32:12.160 --> 2:32:20.960
 right um and then you have whatever your answer is how do you know what is the what is the

2:32:20.960 --> 2:32:27.440
 epistemic basis for for postulating that there's also a whole nother reason for asking that question

2:32:27.440 --> 2:32:34.480
 i don't i mean that doesn't even apply to you whatsoever which is it's interesting how few

2:32:34.480 --> 2:32:43.920
 people have been asked questions like it we we we joke about these questions is silly right

2:32:44.720 --> 2:32:50.960
 it's it's funny to watch a person and if i was more of an asshole i would really stick on that

2:32:50.960 --> 2:32:57.200
 question right it's a silly question in some sense but like we haven't really considered

2:32:57.200 --> 2:33:02.720
 what it means just a more concrete version of that question is what is what is a better world

2:33:02.720 --> 2:33:08.400
 what is the kind of world we're trying to create really i think have you really thought okay i'll

2:33:08.400 --> 2:33:13.840
 give you some kind of simple answers to that that are meaningful to me but let me do the societal

2:33:13.840 --> 2:33:19.280
 indices first because they're fun yes we should take a note of this meaningful thing because it's

2:33:19.280 --> 2:33:23.760
 important to come back to um are you reminding me to ask you about the meaning of life noted

2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:32.800
 let me jot that down yeah so um well because i think i stopped tracking it like 25 open threads

2:33:33.920 --> 2:33:41.440
 okay let her all burn one index that i find very interesting is the inverse correlation of

2:33:41.440 --> 2:33:49.600
 addiction within the society the more a society produces addiction within the people in it the

2:33:49.600 --> 2:33:56.480
 less healthy i think the society is as a pretty fundamental metric and so the more the individuals

2:33:56.480 --> 2:34:03.440
 feel that there are less compulsive things in compelling them to behave in ways that are destructive

2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:10.240
 to their own values and insofar as a civilization is conditioning and influencing the individuals

2:34:10.240 --> 2:34:19.520
 within it the inverse of addiction broadly defined correct addiction what's yeah compulsive behavior

2:34:19.520 --> 2:34:29.520
 that is destructive towards things that we value yeah i think that's a very interesting one to

2:34:29.520 --> 2:34:32.880
 think about that's a really interesting one yeah and this is then also where comfort and

2:34:32.880 --> 2:34:38.880
 addiction start to get very close and the ability to go in the other direction from addiction is

2:34:38.880 --> 2:34:45.920
 the ability to be exposed to hypernormal stimuli and not go down the path of desensitizing to other

2:34:45.920 --> 2:34:52.640
 stimuli and needing that hypernormal stimuli which does involve a kind of hormesis so i do think

2:34:52.640 --> 2:35:02.560
 the civilization of the future has to create something like ritualized discomfort and um

2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:08.640
 um ritualized discomfort yeah i think that's what the sweat lodge and the vision quest

2:35:09.440 --> 2:35:14.240
 and the solo journey and the ayahuasca journey and the sundance were i think it's even a big

2:35:14.240 --> 2:35:21.920
 part of what yoga asana was um is to make beings that are resilient and strong they have to overcome

2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:26.560
 some things to make beings that can control their own mind and fear they have to face some fears

2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:31.920
 but we don't want to put everybody in war or real trauma and yet we can see that

2:35:32.640 --> 2:35:37.600
 the most fucked up people we know had childhoods of a lot of trauma but some of the most incredible

2:35:37.600 --> 2:35:41.760
 people we know had childhoods of a lot of trauma whether or not they happen to make it through

2:35:41.760 --> 2:35:48.320
 and overcome that or not so how do we get the benefits of the stealing of character and the

2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:52.160
 resilience and the whatever that happened from the difficulty without traumatizing people

2:35:52.160 --> 2:36:01.440
 a certain kind of ritualized discomfort that not only has us overcome something by ourselves

2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:05.120
 but overcome it together with each other where nobody bails when it gets hard because the other

2:36:05.120 --> 2:36:09.200
 people are there so it's both a resilience of the individuals and a resilience of the bonding

2:36:11.120 --> 2:36:15.200
 so i think we'll keep getting more and more comfortable stuff but we have to also

2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:21.680
 develop resilience in the presence of that um for the anti addiction direction and the fullness

2:36:21.680 --> 2:36:28.080
 of character um and the trustworthiness to others so you have to be uh consistently

2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:33.520
 injecting discomfort into the system ritualize i mean this sounds like uh you have to imagine

2:36:33.520 --> 2:36:44.080
 sycophas happy you have to uh imagine sycophas with his rock optimally resilient from a metrics

2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:52.320
 perspective in society so we want we want to constantly be throwing rocks at ourselves

2:36:52.320 --> 2:36:59.920
 not constantly uh you didn't have to frequently um periodically yes and there's different levels

2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:04.320
 of intensity different period of disease now i do not think this should be imposed by states

2:37:05.600 --> 2:37:11.040
 i think it should emerge from cultures and i think the cultures are developing people that

2:37:11.040 --> 2:37:17.280
 understand the value of it so the people so there is both a cultural cohesion to it but

2:37:17.280 --> 2:37:21.920
 there's also a voluntarism because the people value the thing that is being developed to understand

2:37:21.920 --> 2:37:27.040
 it and that's what condition so it's conditioning it's conditioning some of these um some of these

2:37:27.040 --> 2:37:31.680
 values and conditioning is a bad word because we like our idea of sovereignty but when we recognize

2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:38.160
 the language that we speak and the words that we think in and the patterns of thought built

2:37:38.160 --> 2:37:42.320
 into that language and the aesthetics that we like and so much is conditioned in us just

2:37:42.320 --> 2:37:47.200
 based on where we're born you can't not condition people so all you can do is take more responsibility

2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:50.560
 for what the conditioning factors are and then you have to think about this question of what is

2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:55.200
 a meaningful human life because we're unlike the other animals born into environment that they're

2:37:55.200 --> 2:37:59.600
 genetically adapted for we're building new environments that we were not adapted for and

2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:04.240
 then we're becoming affected by those so then we have to say well what kinds of environments

2:38:04.240 --> 2:38:10.960
 digital environments physical environments social environments would we want to create that would

2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:17.040
 develop the healthiest happiest most moral noble meaningful people and what are even those

2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:22.240
 sets of things that matter so you end up getting deep existential consideration at the heart of

2:38:22.240 --> 2:38:26.080
 civilization design when you start to rise how powerful we're becoming and how much

2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:32.000
 what we're building it in service towards matters before I pull it I think three threads you just

2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:36.640
 lay down is there another metric index say you're interested I'll tell you one more that I really

2:38:36.640 --> 2:38:42.400
 like there's a there's a number but the one then the next one that comes to mind is

2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:47.680
 I have to make a very quick model

2:38:51.280 --> 2:38:58.400
 healthy human bonding say we were in a tribal type setting my positive emotional states and your

2:38:58.400 --> 2:39:03.360
 positive emotional states would most of the time be correlated your negative emotional

2:39:03.360 --> 2:39:08.960
 states in mind and so you start laughing I start laughing you start crying my eyes might tear up

2:39:09.680 --> 2:39:18.800
 and we would call that the compassion compersion axis I would this is a model I find useful so

2:39:18.800 --> 2:39:22.800
 compassion is when you're feeling something negative I feel some pain I feel some empathy

2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:28.320
 something in relationship compersion is when you do well I'm stoked for you right like I actually

2:39:28.320 --> 2:39:33.920
 feel happiness right down I like compersion yeah the fact that it's such an uncommon word in English

2:39:33.920 --> 2:39:38.960
 is actually a problem culturally because I feel that often and I think that's a really good feeling

2:39:38.960 --> 2:39:44.480
 to feel and maximize for actually that's actually the metric I'm gonna say oh is the compassion

2:39:44.480 --> 2:39:51.200
 compersion at axis is the thing I would optimize for now there is a state where my emotional states

2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:57.920
 and your emotional states are just totally decoupled and that is like sociopathy I don't want

2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:02.240
 to hurt you but I don't care if I do or for you to do well or whatever but there's a worst state

2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:08.080
 and it's extremely common which is where they're inversely coupled where my positive emotions

2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:14.720
 correspond to your negative ones and vice versa and that is the I would call it the jealousy

2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:21.440
 sadism axis the jealousy axis is when you're doing really well I feel something bad I feel

2:40:21.440 --> 2:40:32.240
 taken away from less than upset envious whatever and that's so common but I think of it as kind of a

2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:39.360
 low grade psychopathology that we've just normalized the idea that I'm actually upset at the happiness

2:40:39.360 --> 2:40:43.760
 or fulfillment or success of another is like a profoundly fucked up thing no we shouldn't

2:40:43.760 --> 2:40:47.440
 shame it and repress it so it gets worse we should study it where does it come from and it

2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:52.400
 comes from our own insecurities and stuff and but then the next part that everybody knows is

2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:58.640
 really fucked up is just on the same axis it's the same inverted which is to the jealousy or the

2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:04.400
 envy is the I feel badly when you're doing well the sadism side is I actually feel good when you

2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:08.720
 lose or when you're in pain I feel some happiness that's associated and you can see when someone

2:41:08.720 --> 2:41:14.240
 feels jealous sometimes they feel jealous with a partner and then they feel they want that partner

2:41:14.240 --> 2:41:21.040
 to get it revenge comes up or something so sadism is really like jealousy is one step on the path

2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:27.040
 to sadism from the healthy compassion conversion axis so I would like to see a society that is

2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:34.640
 inversely that is conditioning sadism and jealousy inversely right the lower that amount and the more

2:41:34.640 --> 2:41:38.800
 the compassion conversion and if I had to summarize that very simply I'd say it would optimize for

2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:46.960
 conversion which is because notice that's not just saying love for you where I might be self

2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:52.080
 sacrificing and miserable and I love people but I kill myself which I don't think anybody thinks

2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:56.320
 great idea or happiness where I might be sociopathically happy where I'm causing problems all over

2:41:56.320 --> 2:42:02.000
 the place or even sadistically happy but it's a coupling right that I'm actually feeling happiness

2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:06.560
 in relationship to yours and even in causal relationship where I my own agentic desire to

2:42:06.560 --> 2:42:11.600
 get happier wants to support you too that's actually speaking of another pickup line

2:42:13.520 --> 2:42:19.680
 that's quite honestly what I this is a guy who's single this is going to come out very ridiculous

2:42:19.680 --> 2:42:26.960
 because it's like oh yeah where's your girlfriend bro but that's what I look for in a relationship

2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:35.840
 because it's like it's so much it's so it's such an amazing life where you actually get joy from

2:42:35.840 --> 2:42:41.920
 another person's success and they get joy from your success and then it becomes like you don't

2:42:41.920 --> 2:42:49.440
 actually need to succeed much for that to have a like a a loop like a cycle of just like happiness

2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:55.760
 that just increases like exponentially it's weird so like just be just enjoying the the happiness

2:42:55.760 --> 2:43:01.360
 of others this success of others so this this is like the let's call this because the first

2:43:01.360 --> 2:43:06.480
 person that drilled this into my head is Rogan Joe Rogan he was the embodiment of that because I saw

2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:16.240
 somebody who is successful rich and nonstop true I mean you could tell when somebody's full of

2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:22.800
 shit and somebody's not really genuinely enjoying the success of his friends that that was weird to

2:43:22.800 --> 2:43:28.640
 me that was interesting and I mean the way you're kind of speaking to it the reason Joe stood out

2:43:28.640 --> 2:43:35.440
 to me is I guess I haven't witnessed genuine expression of that often in this culture I've

2:43:35.440 --> 2:43:42.160
 just real joy for others I mean part of that has to do there hasn't been many channels where you can

2:43:43.120 --> 2:43:47.520
 watch or listen to people being their authentic selves so I'm sure there's a bunch of people

2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:52.720
 who live life with compulsion they probably don't seek public attention also but the

2:43:52.720 --> 2:43:58.640
 that that was yeah if there was any word that could express what what I've learned from Joe

2:43:58.640 --> 2:44:07.440
 why he's been a really inspiring figure is that compulsion and I wish our world was had a lot more

2:44:07.440 --> 2:44:16.880
 of that because then I mean my own sorry to go in a small tangent but like you're speaking how

2:44:16.880 --> 2:44:22.720
 society should function but I feel like if you optimize for that metric in your own personal life

2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:30.240
 you're going to live a truly fulfilling life I don't know what the great word to use but that's

2:44:30.240 --> 2:44:36.720
 a really good way to live life you will also learn what gets in the way of it right and how to work

2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:41.520
 with it that if you wanted to help try to build systems at scale or apply Facebook or exponential

2:44:41.520 --> 2:44:48.720
 technologies to do that you would have more actual depth of real knowledge of what that takes and

2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:52.880
 this is you know as you mentioned that there's this virtuous cycle between when you get stoked on

2:44:52.880 --> 2:44:56.320
 other people doing well and then they have a similar relationship to you and everyone is in

2:44:56.320 --> 2:45:02.960
 the process of building each other up and this is what I would say the healthy version of competition

2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:09.520
 is versus the unhealthy version the healthy version right the the root I believe it's a lot

2:45:09.520 --> 2:45:14.880
 and word that means to strive together and it's that impulse of becoming where I want to become

2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:19.200
 more but I recognize that there's actually a hormesis there's a challenge that is needed

2:45:19.200 --> 2:45:24.160
 for me to be able to do that but that means that yes there's an impulse where I'm trying to get

2:45:24.160 --> 2:45:28.960
 ahead maybe I'm even trying to win but I actually want a good opponent and I want them to get ahead

2:45:28.960 --> 2:45:33.120
 too because that is where my ongoing becoming happens and the win itself will get boring very

2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:38.800
 quickly the ongoing becoming is where there's a liveness and for the ongoing becoming they need

2:45:38.800 --> 2:45:42.880
 to have it too and that's the strive together that so in the healthy competition I'm stoked when

2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:48.160
 they're doing really well because my becoming is supported by it now this is actually a very nice

2:45:48.160 --> 2:46:00.320
 segue into a model I like about what a meaningful human life is if you want to go there let's go

2:46:00.320 --> 2:46:07.920
 there what I have I have three things I'm going elsewhere with but if we were first let us take

2:46:07.920 --> 2:46:14.640
 this short stroll through the park of the meaning of life Daniel what is a meaningful life?

2:46:16.160 --> 2:46:24.400
 I think the semantics end up mattering because a lot of people will take the word meaning and the

2:46:24.400 --> 2:46:30.800
 word purpose almost interchangeably and they'll think kind of what is the meaning of my life

2:46:30.800 --> 2:46:33.920
 what is the meaning of human life what is the meaning of life what's the meaning of the universe

2:46:33.920 --> 2:46:39.600
 and what is the meaning of existence rather than non existence so there's a lot of kind

2:46:39.600 --> 2:46:45.040
 of existential considerations there and I think there's some cognitive mistakes that are very easy

2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:52.320
 like taking the idea of purpose which is like a goal which is a utilitarian concept the purpose

2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:56.080
 of one thing is defined in relationship to other things that have assumed value

2:46:58.720 --> 2:47:03.280
 and to say what is the purpose of everything well it's a purpose is too small of a question

2:47:03.280 --> 2:47:06.720
 it's fundamentally a relative question within everything what is the purpose of one thing

2:47:06.720 --> 2:47:09.840
 relative to another what is the purpose of everything and there's nothing outside of it

2:47:09.840 --> 2:47:15.920
 with which to say it you actually just got to the limits of the utility of the concept of purpose

2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:19.360
 it doesn't mean it's purposeless in the sense of something inside of it being purposeless it

2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:25.840
 means the concept is too small which is why you end up getting to you know like in Taoism talking

2:47:25.840 --> 2:47:32.400
 about the nature of it rather the there's a fundamental what where the why can't go deeper

2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:39.840
 is the nature of it but I'm gonna try to speak to a much simpler part which is when people

2:47:39.840 --> 2:47:44.720
 think about what is a meaningful human life and kind of if we were to optimize for something at

2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:50.160
 the level of individual life but also how does optimizing for this at the level of the individual

2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:57.920
 life lead to the best society for insofar as people living that way affects others and long

2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:03.280
 term the world as a whole and how would we then make a civilization that was trying to think

2:48:03.280 --> 2:48:11.200
 about these things because you can see that there are a lot of dialectics where there's value on

2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:20.160
 two sides individualism and collectivism or the ability to accept things and the ability to push

2:48:20.160 --> 2:48:27.120
 harder and whatever and there's failure modes on both sides and so when you were starting to say

2:48:27.120 --> 2:48:30.960
 okay individual happiness you're like wait fuck say this can be happy while hurting people it's

2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:35.600
 not individual happiness it's love but wait some people can self sacrifice out of love in a way

2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:41.760
 that actually ends up just creating codependency for everybody or okay so so how do we think about

2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:51.920
 all those things together one like this kind of came to me as a simple way that I kind of relate

2:48:51.920 --> 2:48:58.720
 to it is that a meaningful life involves the mode of being the mode of doing and the mode of

2:48:58.720 --> 2:49:07.520
 becoming and it involves a virtuous relationship between those three and that any of those modes

2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:13.840
 on their own also have failure modes that are not a meaningful life the mode of being the way I

2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:23.680
 would describe it if if we're talking about the essence of it is about taking in and appreciating

2:49:23.680 --> 2:49:30.480
 the beauty of life that is now to mode that is in the moment and that is largely about being with

2:49:30.480 --> 2:49:37.120
 what is it's fundamentally grounded in the nature of experience and the meaningfulness of experience

2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:42.880
 the prima facia meaningfulness of when I'm having this experience I'm not actually asking what the

2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:48.080
 meaning of life is I'm actually full of it I'm full of experiencing it the momentary experience

2:49:48.080 --> 2:49:56.880
 yes so taking in the beauty of life doing is adding to the beauty of life I'm going to produce

2:49:56.880 --> 2:50:00.400
 some art I'm going to produce some technology that will make life easier more beautiful for

2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:07.840
 somebody else I'm going to do some science that will end up leading to better insights or others

2:50:07.840 --> 2:50:11.280
 people's ability to appreciate the beauty of life more because they understand more about it or

2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:15.760
 whatever it is or protect it right I'm going to protect it in some way but that's adding to

2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:21.920
 or being in service of the beauty of life through our doing and becoming is getting better at both

2:50:21.920 --> 2:50:26.720
 of those being able to deepen our being which is to be able to take in the beauty of life more

2:50:26.720 --> 2:50:33.200
 profoundly be more moved by it touched by it and increasing our capacity with doing to add to the

2:50:33.200 --> 2:50:42.800
 beauty of life more and so I hold that a meaningful life has to be all three of those and where

2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:49.760
 they're not in conflict with each other ultimately it grounds in being it grounds in the intrinsic

2:50:49.760 --> 2:50:56.000
 meaningfulness of experience and then my doing is ultimately something that will be able to

2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:01.360
 increase the possibility of the quality of experience for others and my becoming is a

2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:07.360
 deepening on those so it grounds an experience and also the evolutionary possibility of experience

2:51:08.720 --> 2:51:16.000
 and the point is to oscillate between these never getting stuck on anyone

2:51:17.040 --> 2:51:22.960
 yeah or I suppose in parallel well you can't really attention as a thing you can only allocate

2:51:22.960 --> 2:51:32.000
 attention I want moments where I am absorbed in the sunset and I'm not thinking about what to do

2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:39.440
 next yeah and then the fullness of that can make it to where my doing doesn't come from what's in

2:51:39.440 --> 2:51:47.360
 it for me because I actually feel overwhelmingly full already and then it's like how can I how

2:51:47.360 --> 2:51:52.480
 can I make life better for other people that don't have as much opportunities I had how can I add

2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:59.440
 something wonderful how can I just be in the creative process and so I think where the doing

2:51:59.440 --> 2:52:04.080
 comes from matters and if the doing comes from a fullness of being it's inherently going to be

2:52:04.080 --> 2:52:09.760
 paying attention to externalities or it's more oriented to do that than if it comes from some

2:52:09.760 --> 2:52:14.000
 emptiness that is trying to get full in some way that is willing to cause sacrifices other places

2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:20.640
 and where a chunk of its attention is internally focused and so when Buddha said desires the cause

2:52:20.640 --> 2:52:26.480
 of all suffering then later the vow of the bodhisattva which was to show up for all sentient beings

2:52:26.480 --> 2:52:34.320
 in universe forever is a pretty intense thing like desire I would say there's a kind of desire

2:52:34.320 --> 2:52:38.480
 if we think of desire as a basis for movement like a flow or a gradient there's a kind of desire

2:52:38.480 --> 2:52:43.360
 that comes from something missing inside seeking fulfillment of that in the world that ends up

2:52:43.360 --> 2:52:48.960
 being the cause of actions that perpetuate suffering but there's also not just non desire

2:52:48.960 --> 2:52:54.080
 there's a kind of desire that comes from feeling full at the beauty of life and wanting to add to

2:52:54.080 --> 2:53:00.560
 it that is a flow this direction and I don't think that is the cause of suffering I think that is

2:53:01.120 --> 2:53:05.120
 you know and the western traditions right the eastern traditions focused on that

2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:09.440
 and kind of unconditional happiness outside of them in the moment outside of time western

2:53:09.440 --> 2:53:14.240
 traditions said no actually desires the source of creativity and we're here to be made in the image

2:53:14.240 --> 2:53:19.840
 and likeness of the creator we're here to be fundamentally creative but creating from where

2:53:19.840 --> 2:53:23.680
 and in service of what creating from a sense of connection to everything and wholeness in

2:53:23.680 --> 2:53:30.000
 service of the well being of all of it is very different which is back to that compassion

2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:39.360
 compersion axis being doing becoming it's pretty powerful also could potentially be

2:53:39.360 --> 2:53:51.440
 algorithmatized into a robot just saying where does where does death come into that

2:53:54.240 --> 2:53:59.920
 being is forgetting I mean the the concept of time completely there's a there's a sense to

2:53:59.920 --> 2:54:07.840
 doing and becoming that has a deadline and built in the urgency built in do you think

2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:12.480
 death is fundamental to this to a meaningful life

2:54:15.760 --> 2:54:17.680
 acknowledging or

2:54:20.320 --> 2:54:26.800
 feeling the terror of death like Ernest Becker or just acknowledging the uncertainty the mystery the

2:54:28.080 --> 2:54:32.480
 the melancholy nature of the fact that the right ends is that part of this equation

2:54:32.480 --> 2:54:38.800
 or though unnecessary okay look at how it could be related I've experienced fear of death

2:54:40.160 --> 2:54:41.440
 I've also experienced

2:54:44.160 --> 2:54:49.760
 times where I thought I was gonna die it felt extremely peaceful and beautiful and

2:54:53.920 --> 2:54:59.520
 it's funny because if we we can be afraid of death because we're afraid of hell or

2:54:59.520 --> 2:55:03.040
 battery incarnation or the bardo or some kind of idea of the afterlife we have where we're

2:55:03.040 --> 2:55:07.360
 projecting some kind of sentient suffering but if we're afraid of just non experience

2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:15.680
 I notice that every time I stay up late enough that I'm really tired I'm longing for deep

2:55:15.680 --> 2:55:20.080
 deep sleep and non experience right like I'm actually longing for experience to stop

2:55:20.960 --> 2:55:28.720
 and it's not morbid it's not a bummer it's and and I don't mind falling asleep and I sometimes

2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:34.080
 when I wake up want to go back into it and then when it's done I'm happy to come out of it so

2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:43.600
 when we think about death and having finite time here and we could talk about

2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:47.600
 if we live for a thousand years instead of a hundred or something like that it'll still be

2:55:47.600 --> 2:55:53.440
 finite time the one bummer with the age we die is that I generally find that people mostly start

2:55:53.440 --> 2:56:02.560
 to emotionally mature just shortly before they die but there's

2:56:05.840 --> 2:56:10.640
 if I get to live forever I I can just stay focused on what's in it for me forever

2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:20.400
 and if life continues and consciousness and sentience and people appreciating beauty and

2:56:20.400 --> 2:56:26.000
 adding to it and becoming continues my life doesn't but my life can have effects that continue

2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:32.640
 well beyond it then life with a capital L starts mattering more to me than my life my life gets

2:56:32.640 --> 2:56:38.240
 to be a part of it and in service to and the whole thing about when old men plant trees the

2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:45.040
 shade of which they'll never get to be in I remember the first time I read this poem by

2:56:45.040 --> 2:56:52.560
 Hafez the Sufi poet written in like 13th century or something like that and he talked about

2:56:53.600 --> 2:56:58.000
 that if you're lonely to think about him and he was kind of leaning his spirit

2:56:59.520 --> 2:57:04.880
 into yours across the distance of a millennium and would come for you with these poems and

2:57:04.880 --> 2:57:08.960
 just thinking about people millennium from now and caring about their experience and what they'd

2:57:08.960 --> 2:57:12.080
 be suffering if they'd be lonely and could he offer something that could touch them

2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:19.440
 and it's just fucking beautiful and so like the most beautiful parts of humans have to do with

2:57:19.440 --> 2:57:26.080
 something that transcends what's in it for me and death forces you to that so not not only

2:57:26.080 --> 2:57:34.720
 does death create the urgency it urgency of doing it you're very right it does have a sense

2:57:34.720 --> 2:57:43.840
 in which it incentivizes the compersion and the compassion and the widening you remember

2:57:43.840 --> 2:57:48.160
 Einstein had that quote something to the effect of it's an optical delusion of consciousness to

2:57:48.160 --> 2:57:54.320
 believe there are separate things there's this one thing we call universe and something about us

2:57:54.320 --> 2:58:00.880
 being inside of a prison of perception that can only you know see a very narrow little bit of it

2:58:00.880 --> 2:58:10.800
 but this this might be just some weird disposition of mine but when I think about the future after

2:58:10.800 --> 2:58:19.280
 I'm dead and I think about consciousness I think about young people falling in love for the first

2:58:19.280 --> 2:58:23.360
 time in their their experience and I think about people being awed by sunsets and I think about

2:58:23.360 --> 2:58:34.800
 all of it right I can't not feel connected to that do you feel some sadness to the very high

2:58:34.800 --> 2:58:41.200
 likelihood that you'll be forgotten completely by all of human history you Daniel the name

2:58:42.560 --> 2:58:47.840
 that that which cannot be named systems like to self perpetuate

2:58:47.840 --> 2:58:56.480
 egos do that the idea that I might do something meaningful that future people appreciate of

2:58:56.480 --> 2:59:02.480
 course there's like a certain sweetness to that idea but I know how many people did something

2:59:03.360 --> 2:59:07.200
 did things that I wouldn't be here without and that my life would be less without whose names

2:59:07.200 --> 2:59:14.160
 I will never know and I feel a gratitude to them I feel a closeness I feel touched by that and I

2:59:14.160 --> 2:59:21.520
 think to the degree that the future people are conscious enough there is a you know a lot of

2:59:21.520 --> 2:59:25.840
 traditions had this kind of are we being good ancestors and respect for the ancestors beyond

2:59:25.840 --> 2:59:32.720
 the names I think that's a very healthy idea but let me return to a much less beautiful

2:59:32.720 --> 2:59:38.480
 and much less pleasant conversation you mentioned prison back to x risk okay

2:59:38.480 --> 2:59:45.200
 okay and conditioning you mentioned something about the state

2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:56.400
 so what role let's talk about companies governments parents all the mechanisms that

2:59:56.400 --> 3:00:02.720
 can be a source of conditioning which flavor of ice cream do you like do you think the state

3:00:03.440 --> 3:00:08.160
 is the right thing for the future so governments that are elected democratic systems

3:00:08.160 --> 3:00:13.920
 that are representing representative democracy is there some kind of political system

3:00:14.960 --> 3:00:18.560
 of governance that you find appealing is it parents

3:00:20.560 --> 3:00:28.080
 meaning a very close knit tribes of conditioning that's the most essential and then you and Michael

3:00:28.080 --> 3:00:37.520
 malice would happily agree that it's anarchy where the state should be dissolved or destroyed or

3:00:37.520 --> 3:00:46.000
 burned to the ground if you're Michael malice giggling holding the torch as the fire burns

3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:54.000
 so which which is it is the state can the state be good or is the state bad for the condition of a

3:00:54.640 --> 3:01:00.960
 beautiful world a or b this is like an s you like you like to give these a simplified good or bad

3:01:00.960 --> 3:01:07.760
 things would i like the state that we live in currently the united states federal government

3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:13.120
 to stop existing today no i would really not like that i think that'd be not quite bad for

3:01:13.920 --> 3:01:21.920
 the world in a lot of ways do i think that it's a optimal social system and maximally

3:01:21.920 --> 3:01:27.600
 just and humane and all those things and i wanted to continue as is no also not that but i am much

3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:34.640
 more interested in it being able to evolve to a better thing without going through the catastrophe

3:01:34.640 --> 3:01:43.360
 phase that i think it's just non existence would give so what size of state is good in a sense like

3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:48.080
 do we should we as a human society as this world becomes more globalized should we be constantly

3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:57.840
 striving to reduce the we can we can put on a map like right now literally like the the the centers

3:01:57.840 --> 3:02:03.520
 of power in the world some of them are tech companies some of them are governments should

3:02:03.520 --> 3:02:09.760
 we be trying to as much as possible decentralize the power to where it's very difficult to point

3:02:09.760 --> 3:02:17.120
 on the map the centers of power and that means making a state however there's a bunch of different

3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:25.520
 ways to make the government much smaller that could be reducing in the united states reducing the

3:02:26.640 --> 3:02:30.640
 the funding for the government all those kinds of things there's a set of responsibilities

3:02:31.600 --> 3:02:38.640
 the the set of powers it could be i mean this is far out but making more nations

3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:44.480
 or maybe nations not in a space that are defined by geographic location but rather in the space

3:02:44.480 --> 3:02:49.920
 of ideas which is what anarchy is about so anarchy is about forming collectives based on their set

3:02:49.920 --> 3:02:56.560
 of ideas and and doing so dynamically not based on where you were born and so on i think we can

3:02:56.560 --> 3:03:06.160
 say that the natural state of humans if we want to describe such a thing was to live in tribes

3:03:06.160 --> 3:03:12.160
 that were below the dunbar number meaning that for a few hundred thousand years of human history

3:03:12.160 --> 3:03:18.000
 all of the groups of humans mostly stayed under that size and whenever we'd get up to that size

3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:23.200
 it would end up cleaving and so it seems like there's a pretty strong but there weren't individual

3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:27.680
 humans out in the wild doing really well right so we were a group animal but with groups that had

3:03:27.680 --> 3:03:32.720
 a specific size so we could say in a way humans were being domesticated by those groups they were

3:03:32.720 --> 3:03:36.720
 learning how to have certain rules to participate with the group without which you'd get kicked out

3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:43.520
 but that that's still the wild state of people and and maybe it's useful to do as a side statement

3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:48.640
 which i've recently looked at a bunch of papers around Dunbar's number where the mean is actually

3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:54.000
 150 if you actually look at the original papers it's a range it's really a range so it's actually

3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:58.880
 some somewhere under a thousand so it's a range of like two to five hundred or whatever it is

3:03:58.880 --> 3:04:05.920
 but like you could argue that the uh i think it actually is exactly two the range is two to five

3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:12.480
 hundred and twenty something like that and this is the mean that's taken crudely it's not a very

3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:20.240
 good paper the in terms of the actual numerical numerically speaking but it'd be interesting

3:04:20.240 --> 3:04:25.920
 if there's a bunch of Dunbar numbers that could be computed for particular environments particular

3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:31.120
 conditions so on it is very true that they're likely to be something small you know under a

3:04:31.120 --> 3:04:36.720
 million but it'd be interesting if we can expand that number in interesting ways that will change

3:04:36.720 --> 3:04:40.320
 the fabric of this conversation i just want to kind of throw that in there i don't know the

3:04:40.320 --> 3:04:44.640
 if the 150 is baked in some hauling the heart into the hardware we can talk about some of the

3:04:44.640 --> 3:04:50.560
 things that it probably has to do with up to a certain number of people and this is going to

3:04:50.560 --> 3:04:55.440
 be variable based on the social technologies that mediate it to some degree we can talk about that

3:04:55.440 --> 3:05:02.720
 in a minute um up to a certain number of people everybody can know everybody else

3:05:02.720 --> 3:05:07.680
 pretty intimately so let's go ahead and just take 150 as a as an average number

3:05:11.840 --> 3:05:18.640
 everybody can know everyone intimately enough that if your actions made anyone else do poorly

3:05:18.640 --> 3:05:22.960
 it's your extended family and you're stuck living with them and you know who they are and there's

3:05:22.960 --> 3:05:30.720
 no anonymous people there's no just them and over there and that's one part of what leads to a

3:05:30.720 --> 3:05:34.000
 kind of tribal process where it's good for the individual and good for the whole has a coupling

3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:41.200
 also below that scale everyone is somewhat aware of what everybody else is doing there's not

3:05:41.840 --> 3:05:47.680
 groups that are very siloed and as a result it's actually very hard to get away with bad behavior

3:05:47.680 --> 3:05:55.360
 there's a forced kind of transparency and so you don't need kind of like the state in in that way

3:05:55.360 --> 3:05:59.680
 but lying to people doesn't actually get you ahead sociopathic behavior doesn't get you ahead

3:05:59.680 --> 3:06:06.480
 because it gets seen and so there's a conditioning environment where the individual's behaving in

3:06:06.480 --> 3:06:11.840
 a way that is aligned with the interest of the tribe is what gets conditioned when it gets to be

3:06:11.840 --> 3:06:18.240
 a much larger system it becomes easier to hide certain things from the group as a whole as well

3:06:18.240 --> 3:06:24.800
 as to be less emotionally bound to a bunch of anonymous people i would say there's also a communication

3:06:24.800 --> 3:06:31.840
 protocol where up to about that number of people we could all sit around a tribal council and be

3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:36.080
 part of a conversation around a really big decision do we migrate do we not migrate do we you know

3:06:36.080 --> 3:06:44.160
 some something like that do we get rid of this person and why why would i want to agree to be

3:06:44.160 --> 3:06:50.880
 a part of a larger group where everyone can't be part of that council and so i am going to now be

3:06:51.600 --> 3:06:55.840
 subject to law that i have no say in if i could be part of a smaller group that could still survive

3:06:55.840 --> 3:07:01.440
 and i get a say in the law that i'm subject to so i think the cleaving and in a way we can look at it

3:07:01.440 --> 3:07:06.400
 beyond the Dunbar number two is we can look at that a civilization has binding energy

3:07:06.400 --> 3:07:10.080
 that is holding them together and has cleaving energy and if the binding energy exceeds the

3:07:10.080 --> 3:07:14.880
 cleaving energy that civilization will last and so there are things that we can do to decrease

3:07:14.880 --> 3:07:18.480
 the cleaving energy within the society things we can do to increase the binding energy i think

3:07:18.480 --> 3:07:24.800
 naturally we saw that had certain characteristics up to a certain size kind of tribalism that ended

3:07:24.800 --> 3:07:29.760
 with a few things it ended with people having migrated enough that when you started to get resource

3:07:29.760 --> 3:07:35.840
 wars you couldn't just migrate away easily and so tribal warfare became more obligated it involved

3:07:35.840 --> 3:07:40.640
 the plow in the beginning of real economic surplus there were so there were a few different kind of

3:07:41.920 --> 3:07:49.440
 forcing functions but we're talking about what size should it be right what size should a society

3:07:49.440 --> 3:07:55.680
 be and i think the idea like if we think about your body for a moment as a self organizing

3:07:55.680 --> 3:08:01.920
 complex system that is multi scaled we think about body is a wonderland our body is a wonderland

3:08:01.920 --> 3:08:09.840
 yeah uh you have that's a john mayer song i apologize but yes so uh if we think about our

3:08:09.840 --> 3:08:14.880
 our body and the billions of cells that are in it well you don't have like think about how ridiculous

3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:19.440
 it would be to try to have all the tens of trillions of cells in it with no internal

3:08:19.440 --> 3:08:26.000
 organization structure right just like a sea of protoplasm it wouldn't work your democracy and so

3:08:26.560 --> 3:08:32.480
 you have cells and tissues and then you have tissues and organs and organs and organ systems

3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:37.680
 and so you have these layers of organization and then obviously the individual in a tribe in a

3:08:37.680 --> 3:08:44.400
 ecosystem and each of the higher layers are both based on the lower layers but also influencing them

3:08:44.400 --> 3:08:49.760
 yeah i think the future of civilization will be similar which is there's a level of governance

3:08:49.760 --> 3:08:54.960
 that happens at the level of the individual my own governance of my own choice i think there's

3:08:54.960 --> 3:09:00.000
 a level that happens at the level of a family we're making decisions together we're inter influencing

3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:04.640
 each other and affecting each other taking responsibility for the idea of an extended

3:09:04.640 --> 3:09:08.560
 family and you can see that like for a lot of human history we had an extended family we had a local

3:09:08.560 --> 3:09:13.840
 community a local church or whatever it was we had these intermediate structures whereas right

3:09:13.840 --> 3:09:20.960
 now there's kind of like the individual producer consumer taxpayer voter and the massive nation

3:09:20.960 --> 3:09:25.600
 state global complex and not that much in the way of intermediate structures that we relate with

3:09:25.600 --> 3:09:31.280
 and not that much in the way of real personal dynamics all impersonalized made fungible and

3:09:32.560 --> 3:09:39.520
 so i think that we have to have global governance meaning i think we have to have governance at

3:09:39.520 --> 3:09:43.840
 the scale we affect stuff and if if anybody is messing up the oceans that matters for everybody

3:09:43.840 --> 3:09:49.360
 so that that can't only be national or only local everyone is scared of the idea of global

3:09:49.360 --> 3:09:53.840
 governance because we think about some top down system of imposition that now has no checks and

3:09:53.840 --> 3:09:57.600
 balances on power i'm scared of that same version so i'm not talking about that kind of global

3:09:57.600 --> 3:10:03.360
 governance it's why i'm even using the word governance as a process rather than government

3:10:03.360 --> 3:10:10.160
 as an imposed phenomena and so i think we have to have global governance but i think we also have

3:10:10.160 --> 3:10:15.600
 to have local governance and there has to be relationships between them that each where there

3:10:15.600 --> 3:10:20.720
 are both checks and balances and power flows of information so i think governance at the level

3:10:20.720 --> 3:10:26.240
 of cities will be a bigger deal in the future than governance at the level of nation states because

3:10:26.240 --> 3:10:32.960
 i think nation states are largely fictitious things that are defined by wars and agreements to

3:10:32.960 --> 3:10:37.360
 stop wars and like that i think cities are based on real things that will keep being real

3:10:37.360 --> 3:10:42.320
 where the proximity of certain things together the physical proximity of things together gives

3:10:42.320 --> 3:10:48.160
 increased value of those things so you look at like jeffrey west's work on scale and finding that

3:10:48.720 --> 3:10:53.360
 companies and nation states and things that have a kind of complicated agreement structure get

3:10:53.360 --> 3:10:58.560
 diminishing return of production per capita as the total number of people increases beyond

3:10:58.560 --> 3:11:03.280
 about the tribal scale but the city actually gets increasing productivity per capita but it's not

3:11:03.280 --> 3:11:08.000
 designed it's kind of this organic thing right so there should be governance at the level of

3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:13.360
 cities because people can sense and actually have some agency there probably neighborhoods and smaller

3:11:13.360 --> 3:11:17.200
 scales within it and also verticals and some of it won't be geographic it'll be network based

3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:23.440
 right networks of affinities so i don't think the future is one type of governance now what we can say

3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:28.240
 more broadly is say when we're talking about groups of people that interaffect each other the idea of

3:11:28.240 --> 3:11:33.840
 a civilization is that we can figure out how to coordinate our choice making to not be at war with

3:11:33.840 --> 3:11:39.680
 each other and hopefully increase total productive capacity anyway that's good for everybody division

3:11:39.680 --> 3:11:45.840
 of labor and specialties so we all get more better stuff and whatever but it's a it's a

3:11:45.840 --> 3:11:54.080
 coordination of our choice making i think we can look at civilizations failing on the side of not

3:11:54.080 --> 3:11:57.680
 having enough coordination of choice making so they fail on the side of chaos and then they

3:11:57.680 --> 3:12:04.320
 cleave and an internal war comes about or whatever or they can't make smart decisions and they over

3:12:04.320 --> 3:12:12.960
 use their resources or whatever or it can fail on the side of trying to get order via imposition

3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:19.600
 via force and so it fails on the side of oppression which ends up being for a while functional ish

3:12:19.600 --> 3:12:24.560
 for the thing as a whole but miserable for most people in it until it fails either because of

3:12:24.560 --> 3:12:28.880
 revolt or because it can't innovate enough or something like that and so there's this like

3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:37.520
 toggling between order via oppression and chaos and i think the idea of democracy not the way

3:12:37.520 --> 3:12:42.240
 we've implemented it but the idea of it whether we're talking about a representative democracy or a

3:12:42.240 --> 3:12:48.880
 direct digital democracy liquid democracy republic or whatever the idea of an open society participatory

3:12:48.880 --> 3:12:56.320
 governance is can we have order that is emergent rather than imposed so that we aren't stuck with

3:12:56.320 --> 3:13:03.760
 chaos and infighting and inability to coordinate and we're also not stuck with oppression and

3:13:05.120 --> 3:13:10.880
 what would it take to have emergent order this is the most kind of central question for me these

3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:18.240
 days because if we look at what different nation states are doing around the world

3:13:18.240 --> 3:13:24.000
 and we see nation states that are more authoritarian that in some ways are actually

3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:31.920
 coordinating much more effectively so for instance we can see that china has built high speed rail

3:13:31.920 --> 3:13:36.560
 not just through its country but around the world and the u.s hasn't built any high speed rail yet

3:13:36.560 --> 3:13:41.360
 you can see that it brought 300 million people out of poverty in a time where we've had increasing

3:13:41.360 --> 3:13:48.400
 economic inequality happening you can see like that if there was a single country that could make

3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:53.040
 all of its own stuff if the global supply chains failed china would be the closest one to being able

3:13:53.040 --> 3:14:01.520
 to start to go closed loop on fundamental things uh belt and road initiative supply chain on rare

3:14:01.520 --> 3:14:06.640
 earth metals transistor manufacturing that is like oh they're actually coordinating more effectively

3:14:06.640 --> 3:14:14.880
 in some important ways in the last call it 30 years and that's imposed order imposed order

3:14:15.520 --> 3:14:22.400
 and we can see that if in the u.s if let's look at why real quick

3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:29.280
 we know why we created term limits so that we wouldn't have forever monarchs that's the thing

3:14:29.280 --> 3:14:33.280
 we were trying to get away from and that there would be checks and balances on power and that

3:14:33.280 --> 3:14:38.000
 kind of thing but that also has created a negative second order effect which is nobody

3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:42.960
 does long term planning because somebody comes in who's got four years they want reelected

3:14:42.960 --> 3:14:47.120
 they don't do anything that doesn't create a return within four years that will end up getting them

3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:53.200
 elected reelected and so the 30 year industrial development to build high speed trains or the

3:14:53.200 --> 3:14:58.560
 new kind of fusion energy or whatever it is just doesn't get invested in and then if you have left

3:14:58.560 --> 3:15:04.160
 versus right where whatever someone does for four years then the other guy gets in and undoes it for

3:15:04.160 --> 3:15:08.960
 four years and most of the energy goes into campaigning against each other this system is

3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:13.520
 just dissipating as heat right like it's just burning up as heat and the system that has no

3:15:13.520 --> 3:15:18.400
 term limits and no internal friction in fighting because they got rid of those people can actually

3:15:18.400 --> 3:15:27.120
 coordinate better but uh i would argue it has its own fail states eventually and dystopic properties

3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:31.680
 that are not the thing we want there so the goals to accomplish to create a system that

3:15:31.680 --> 3:15:38.480
 does the long term planning without the negative effects of a monarch or dictator that stays there

3:15:38.480 --> 3:15:52.080
 for the long term and uh accomplish that through uh not through the imposition of a single leader

3:15:52.080 --> 3:16:00.560
 but through emergent so that doesn't that perhaps first of all the technology in itself seems to

3:16:00.560 --> 3:16:06.720
 maybe maybe you disagree allow for different possibilities here which is make primary the

3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:16.320
 system not the humans so the the the basic the medium on which the democracy happens like

3:16:16.320 --> 3:16:25.920
 like a platform or where people can make decisions do the choice making the coordination of the

3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:32.640
 choice making where emerges some kind of order to where like something that applies at the

3:16:32.640 --> 3:16:41.280
 scale of the family the extended family the city the the country the the continent the whole world

3:16:41.280 --> 3:16:45.760
 and then does that so dynamically constantly changing based on the needs of the people

3:16:45.760 --> 3:16:53.520
 sort of always evolving and it would all be owned by google like doesn't that doesn't this

3:16:54.720 --> 3:17:00.640
 is there a way to um so first of all you're optimistic that it you could basically create

3:17:00.640 --> 3:17:06.480
 that technology can save us technology at creating platforms by technology i mean like software

3:17:06.480 --> 3:17:14.000
 and network platforms that allows humans to deliberate like make government together dynamically

3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:21.360
 without the need for a leader that's on a podium screaming stuff that's one and two if you're

3:17:21.360 --> 3:17:28.480
 optimistic about that are you also optimistic about the ceo's of such platforms the idea that

3:17:28.480 --> 3:17:36.560
 technology is values neutral values agnostic it and people can use it for construct over

3:17:36.560 --> 3:17:42.640
 destructive purposes but it doesn't predispose anything it's just it's just silly and naive

3:17:42.640 --> 3:17:48.480
 technology elicits patterns of human behavior because those who utilize it and get ahead

3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:52.880
 end up behaving differently because of their utilization of it and then other people

3:17:53.440 --> 3:17:57.600
 then they end up shaping the world or other people race to also get the power of the technology

3:17:57.600 --> 3:18:03.120
 and so there's whole schools of anthropology that look at the effect on social systems and the minds

3:18:03.120 --> 3:18:08.240
 of people of the change in our tooling uh marvin harris's work called cultural materialism looked

3:18:08.240 --> 3:18:12.640
 at this deeply obviously uh marcia mcluen looked specifically at the way that information technologies

3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:20.400
 change the nature of our beliefs minds values social systems um i will not try to do this

3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:24.640
 rigorously because there are academics will disagree on the subtle details but i'll do it

3:18:24.640 --> 3:18:30.480
 kind of like illustratively you think about the emergence of the plow the ox drawn plow in the

3:18:30.480 --> 3:18:35.520
 beginning of agriculture that came with it where before that you had hunter gather and then you had

3:18:35.520 --> 3:18:42.320
 horticulture kind of a digging stick but not the plow well that the world changed a lot with that

3:18:42.320 --> 3:18:53.600
 right and and a few of the changes that um at least some theorists believe in is when the

3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:57.760
 ox drawn plow started to proliferate any culture that utilized it was able to start to actually

3:18:57.760 --> 3:19:01.440
 cultivate grain because just with a digging stick you couldn't get enough grain for it to matter

3:19:01.440 --> 3:19:04.800
 grain was a storable caloric surplus they could make it through the famines they could grow their

3:19:04.800 --> 3:19:09.040
 populations so the ones that used it got so much ahead that it became obligate and everybody

3:19:09.040 --> 3:19:16.000
 used it that corresponding with the use of a plow animism went away everywhere that it existed

3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:20.320
 because you can't talk about the spirit of the buffalo while beating the cow all day long to

3:19:20.320 --> 3:19:25.200
 pull a plow um so the moment that we do animal husbandry of that kind we have to beat the cow

3:19:25.200 --> 3:19:29.280
 all day you have to say it's just a dumb animal man has dominion over earth and the nature of

3:19:29.280 --> 3:19:34.800
 even our religious and spiritual ideas change you went from women primarily using the digging stick

3:19:34.800 --> 3:19:39.440
 to do the horticulture or gathering before that men doing the hunting stuff to now men had to

3:19:39.440 --> 3:19:43.440
 use the plow because the upper body strength actually really mattered women would have miscarriages

3:19:43.440 --> 3:19:47.680
 when they would do it when they were pregnant so all the caloric supply started to come from men

3:19:47.680 --> 3:19:52.480
 where it had been from both before and the ratio of male female gods changed to being mostly male

3:19:52.480 --> 3:20:00.640
 gods following that um obviously we went from very that particular line of thought then also

3:20:00.640 --> 3:20:09.120
 says that feminism followed the tractor and that the rise of feminism um in the west started to

3:20:09.120 --> 3:20:14.800
 follow women being able to say we can do what men can because the male upper body strength wasn't

3:20:14.800 --> 3:20:19.680
 differential once the internal combustion engine was much stronger um and we can drive a tractor

3:20:19.680 --> 3:20:26.320
 so I don't think to try to trace complex things to one cause is a good idea so I think this is a

3:20:26.320 --> 3:20:33.600
 reductionist view but it has truth in it and so the idea that technology is values agnostic

3:20:33.600 --> 3:20:39.120
 is silly technology codes patterns of behavior that code rationalizing those patterns of behavior

3:20:39.120 --> 3:20:43.440
 and believing in them the the plow also is the beginning of the Anthropocene right it was the

3:20:43.440 --> 3:20:48.560
 beginning of us changing the environment radically to to clear cut areas to just make them useful

3:20:48.560 --> 3:20:53.120
 for people which also meant the change of the view of where the the web of life we're just a part

3:20:53.120 --> 3:21:00.560
 of it etc so all those types of things um so that's brilliantly put but by the way that was just

3:21:00.560 --> 3:21:07.360
 brilliant but the question is so it's not agnostic but so we have to look at what the

3:21:07.360 --> 3:21:14.240
 psychological effects of specific tech applied certain ways are and be able to say it's not just

3:21:14.240 --> 3:21:20.400
 doing the first order thing you intended it's doing like the effect on patriarchy and animism

3:21:20.400 --> 3:21:25.120
 and um the end of tribal culture in the beginning of empire and the class systems that came with

3:21:25.120 --> 3:21:29.840
 that not like we can go on and on about what the plow did um the beginning of surplus was

3:21:29.840 --> 3:21:35.520
 inheritance which then became the capital model and like lots of things so we have to say when

3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:40.880
 we're looking at the tech how is what are the values built into the way the tech is being built

3:21:40.880 --> 3:21:46.240
 that are not obvious right so you always have to consider externalities yes and the externalities

3:21:46.240 --> 3:21:49.600
 are not just physical to the environment they're also to how the people are being conditioned

3:21:49.600 --> 3:21:53.920
 and how the relationality between them is being conditioned question i'm asking you so i personally

3:21:53.920 --> 3:22:00.160
 would rather be led by a plow and a tractor than stalling okay that's the question i'm asking you

3:22:00.160 --> 3:22:09.120
 is uh in creating an emergent government where people where there's a democracy that's dynamic

3:22:09.120 --> 3:22:19.840
 that makes choices that does governance at at like a very kind of liquid like uh there's a bunch of

3:22:19.840 --> 3:22:26.880
 fine resolution layers of abstraction of governance happening at all scales right and doing so

3:22:26.880 --> 3:22:34.000
 dynamically where no one person has power at any one time that can dominate and impose rule okay

3:22:34.000 --> 3:22:42.160
 that's the stalling version i'm saying isn't there the uh the isn't the alternative that's emergent

3:22:43.040 --> 3:22:51.040
 empowered or made possible by the plow and the tractor which is the modern version of that is

3:22:51.040 --> 3:22:57.120
 like the internet the the digital space where we can the monetary system where you have the

3:22:57.120 --> 3:23:02.480
 current currency and so on but you have much more importantly to me at least it's just basic

3:23:02.480 --> 3:23:06.800
 social interaction the mechanisms of human transacting with each other in the space of ideas

3:23:07.520 --> 3:23:14.320
 isn't so yes it's not agnostic definitely not agnostic you've had a brilliant rant there the

3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:21.440
 tractor has effects but isn't that the way we achieve an emergent system of governance yes but

3:23:21.440 --> 3:23:29.600
 i wouldn't say we're on track you haven't seen anything promising it's not that i haven't seen

3:23:29.600 --> 3:23:33.760
 anything promising is that to be on track requires understanding and guiding some of the things

3:23:33.760 --> 3:23:37.920
 differently than is currently happening and it's possible that's actually what i really care about

3:23:38.640 --> 3:23:46.720
 so you couldn't have had a stall in without having certain technologies emerge he couldn't

3:23:46.720 --> 3:23:51.360
 have ruled such a big area without transportation technologies without the the train without the

3:23:52.880 --> 3:23:58.560
 communication tech that made it possible so when you say you'd rather have a tractor or a plow

3:23:58.560 --> 3:24:05.920
 than a stall and there's a relationship between them that is more recursive which is new physical

3:24:05.920 --> 3:24:13.840
 technologies allow rulers to rule with more power over larger distances historically and

3:24:16.400 --> 3:24:20.960
 but some things are more responsible for that than others like stalling also eats

3:24:20.960 --> 3:24:25.760
 stuff for breakfast but the thing he ate for breakfast is less responsible for the starvation

3:24:25.760 --> 3:24:31.040
 of millions than than the train the train is more responsible for that and then the weapons

3:24:31.040 --> 3:24:36.640
 of war are more responsible so some technology like let's not throw it all in the you're saying

3:24:36.640 --> 3:24:43.680
 like technology has a responsibility here but some is better than others i'm saying that people's

3:24:43.680 --> 3:24:48.640
 use of technology will change their behavior so it has behavioral dispositions built in

3:24:48.640 --> 3:24:53.280
 the change of the behavior will also change the values in the society it's very complicated right

3:24:53.280 --> 3:24:58.640
 it will also as a result both make people who have different kinds of predispositions with

3:24:58.640 --> 3:25:04.880
 regard to rulership and different kinds of new capacities and so we have to think about these

3:25:04.880 --> 3:25:11.760
 things it's kind of well understood that the printing press and then in early industrialism

3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:18.320
 ended feudalism and created kind of nation states so one thing i would say as a long trend

3:25:18.320 --> 3:25:25.360
 that we can look at is that whenever there is a step function a major leap in technology physical

3:25:25.360 --> 3:25:31.920
 technology the the underlying techno industrial base with which we do stuff it ends up coding for

3:25:31.920 --> 3:25:37.040
 it ends up predisposing a whole bunch of human behavioral patterns that the previous social

3:25:37.040 --> 3:25:42.480
 system what had not emerged to try to solve and so it usually ends up breaking the previous

3:25:42.480 --> 3:25:46.480
 social systems the way the plow broke the tribal system the way that the industrial revolution

3:25:46.480 --> 3:25:51.280
 broke the feudal system and then new social systems have to emerge that can deal with that

3:25:51.280 --> 3:25:57.520
 the new powers the new dispositions whatever with that tech obviously the nuke broke nation state

3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:02.000
 governance being adequate and said we can't ever have that again so then it created this

3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:13.440
 international governance apparatus world so i guess what i'm saying is that

3:26:13.440 --> 3:26:23.520
 it the solution is not exponential tech following the current path of what the market incentivizes

3:26:23.520 --> 3:26:33.440
 exponential tech to do market being a previous social tech i would say that exponential tech

3:26:35.920 --> 3:26:39.840
 if we look at different types of social tech so let's just briefly look at

3:26:39.840 --> 3:26:47.600
 that democracy tried to do the emergent order thing right at least that's the story

3:26:48.720 --> 3:26:57.520
 and which is and this is why if you look at this important part to build first it's kind

3:26:57.520 --> 3:27:02.640
 of doing it it's just doing it poorly you're saying i mean that's it is emergent order in

3:27:02.640 --> 3:27:07.200
 some sense i mean that's the hope of democracy versus other forms of government correct i mean

3:27:07.200 --> 3:27:11.840
 i i said at least the story because obviously it didn't do it for women and slaves early on it

3:27:11.840 --> 3:27:19.200
 doesn't do it for all classes equally etc but the the idea of democracy is that is participatory

3:27:19.200 --> 3:27:25.280
 governance and so you notice that the modern democracies emerged out of the european enlightenment

3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:31.520
 and specifically because the idea that a lot of people some huge number not a tribal number huge

3:27:31.520 --> 3:27:36.160
 number of anonymous people who don't know each other are not bonded to each other who believe

3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:40.080
 different things who grew up in different ways can all work together to make collective decisions

3:27:40.080 --> 3:27:43.920
 well that affect everybody and where some of them will make compromises and the thing that

3:27:43.920 --> 3:27:48.880
 matters to them for what matters to other strangers that's actually wild like it's a wild idea that

3:27:48.880 --> 3:27:54.640
 that would even be possible and it was kind of the result of this high enlightenment idea that

3:27:55.600 --> 3:28:01.920
 we could all do the philosophy of science and we could all do the hegelian dialectic

3:28:01.920 --> 3:28:10.160
 those ideas had emerged right and it was that we we could all so our choice making because

3:28:10.160 --> 3:28:14.160
 we said a society is trying to coordinate choice making the emergent order is the order of our

3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:17.600
 of the choices that we're making not just at the level of the individuals but what groups of

3:28:17.600 --> 3:28:23.840
 individuals corporations nation states whatever do our choices are based on our choice makings

3:28:23.840 --> 3:28:28.320
 based on our sense making and our meaning making our sense makings what do we believe is happening

3:28:28.320 --> 3:28:32.080
 in the world and what do we believe the effects of a particular thing would be our meaning making

3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:35.040
 is what do we care about right our values generation what do we care about that we're

3:28:35.040 --> 3:28:39.440
 trying to move the world in the direction of if you ultimately are trying to move the world in

3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:43.200
 a direction that is really really different than the direction i'm trying to we have very

3:28:43.200 --> 3:28:47.760
 different values we're gonna have a hard time and if you think the world is a very different

3:28:47.760 --> 3:28:54.080
 world right if you think that systemic racism is rampant everywhere and one of the worst problems

3:28:54.080 --> 3:28:58.960
 and i think it's not even a thing if you think climate change is almost existential and i think

3:28:58.960 --> 3:29:03.840
 it's not even a thing we're gonna have a really hard time coordinating and so we have to be able

3:29:03.840 --> 3:29:10.640
 to have shared sense making of can we come to understand just what is happening together and

3:29:10.640 --> 3:29:14.640
 then can we do shared values generation okay maybe i'm emphasizing a particular value more

3:29:14.640 --> 3:29:18.400
 than you but i can see how i can take your perspective and i can see how the thing that you

3:29:18.400 --> 3:29:23.280
 value is worth valuing and i can see how it's affected by this thing so can we take all the

3:29:23.280 --> 3:29:27.920
 values and try to come up with a proposition that benefits all of them better than the proposition

3:29:27.920 --> 3:29:32.240
 i created just to benefit these ones that harms the ones that you care about which is why you're

3:29:32.240 --> 3:29:37.440
 opposing my proposition yeah we don't even try in the process of crafting a proposition currently

3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:42.800
 to see and this is the reason that the proposition when we vote on it gets half the vote almost all

3:29:42.800 --> 3:29:47.520
 the time it almost never gets 90 percent of the votes is because it benefits some things and harms

3:29:47.520 --> 3:29:52.560
 other things we can say all theory of tradeoffs but we didn't even try to say could we see what

3:29:52.560 --> 3:29:58.640
 everybody cares about and see if there was a better solution so how do we fix that try i i wonder is

3:29:58.640 --> 3:30:05.280
 it is it as simple as the social technology education well no it's that the proposition

3:30:05.280 --> 3:30:11.120
 crafting and refinement process has to be key to a democracy or part of the government and it's not

3:30:11.120 --> 3:30:19.040
 currently but isn't that the humans creating that situation so one way there's two ways to fix that

3:30:19.040 --> 3:30:24.240
 as the one is to fix the individual humans which is the education early in life and the second is

3:30:24.240 --> 3:30:30.240
 to create somehow systems that yeah it's both it's both so i understand the education part

3:30:30.240 --> 3:30:34.800
 but creating systems that's why that's why i mentioned the technologies is creating

3:30:34.800 --> 3:30:38.560
 yes social networks essentially yes that's actually necessary okay so let's go to the

3:30:38.560 --> 3:30:45.360
 first part and then we'll come to the second part so democracy emerged as an enlightenment era idea

3:30:45.360 --> 3:30:51.760
 that we could all do a a dialectic and come to understand what other people valued and so that

3:30:51.760 --> 3:30:58.720
 we could actually come up with a cooperative solution rather than just fuck you we're gonna get our

3:30:58.720 --> 3:31:02.640
 thing in war right and that we could sense make together we could all apply the philosophy of

3:31:02.640 --> 3:31:06.640
 science and you weren't gonna stick to your guns on what the speed of sound is if we measured it

3:31:06.640 --> 3:31:10.720
 and we found out what it was and there's a unifying element of the objectivity in that way

3:31:10.720 --> 3:31:17.200
 and so this is why i believe jefferson said if you could give me a perfect newspaper and a

3:31:17.200 --> 3:31:21.360
 broken government or in paraphrasing or a broken government perfect newspaper i wouldn't hesitate

3:31:21.360 --> 3:31:24.800
 to take the perfect newspaper because if the people understand what's going on they can make

3:31:24.800 --> 3:31:28.320
 build a new government if they don't understand what's going on they can't possibly make good

3:31:28.320 --> 3:31:35.840
 choices and um washington i'm paraphrasing again first president said the number one aim of the

3:31:35.840 --> 3:31:40.160
 federal government should be the comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of

3:31:40.160 --> 3:31:44.000
 government science of government was the term of art think about what that means right science of

3:31:44.000 --> 3:31:50.320
 government would be game theory coordination theory history wouldn't call game theory yet

3:31:51.120 --> 3:31:55.840
 history sociology economics right all the things that lead to how we understand human

3:31:55.840 --> 3:32:01.600
 coordination i think it's so profound that he didn't say the number one aim of the federal

3:32:01.600 --> 3:32:07.760
 government is rule of law and he didn't say it's protecting the border from enemies because if

3:32:07.760 --> 3:32:12.640
 the number one aim was to protect the border from enemies it could do that as military dictatorship

3:32:13.280 --> 3:32:18.640
 quite effectively and if the goal was rule of law it could do it as a dictatorship as a police

3:32:18.640 --> 3:32:24.960
 state and so if the number one goal is anything other than the comprehensive education of all

3:32:24.960 --> 3:32:29.600
 the citizens in the science of government it won't stay democracy long you can see so both

3:32:29.600 --> 3:32:34.480
 education and the fourth estate the fourth estate being the so education can i make sense of the

3:32:34.480 --> 3:32:38.080
 world am i trained to make sense of the world the fourth estate is what's actually going on currently

3:32:38.080 --> 3:32:43.120
 the news do i have good unbiased information about it those are both considered prerequisite

3:32:43.120 --> 3:32:48.720
 institutions for democracy to even be a possibility and then at the scale it was initially suggested

3:32:48.720 --> 3:32:54.720
 here the town hall was the key phenomena where there wasn't a special interest group crafted a

3:32:54.720 --> 3:32:58.800
 proposition and the first thing i ever saw was the proposition to know anything about it and i

3:32:58.800 --> 3:33:02.880
 got a vote yes or no it was in the town hall we all got to talk about it and the proposition could

3:33:02.880 --> 3:33:07.920
 get crafted in real time through the conversation which is why there was that founding father's

3:33:07.920 --> 3:33:13.200
 statement that voting is the death of democracy voting fundamentally is polarizing the population

3:33:13.200 --> 3:33:18.080
 in some kind of sublimated war but the and we'll do that as the last step but what we want to do

3:33:18.080 --> 3:33:22.960
 first is to say how does the thing that you care about that seems damaged by this proposition how

3:33:22.960 --> 3:33:27.280
 could that turn into a solution to make this proposition better where this proposition still

3:33:27.280 --> 3:33:30.880
 tends to the thing it's trying to tend to and tends to that better can we work on this together

3:33:30.880 --> 3:33:35.760
 and that in a town hall we could have that as the scale increased we lost the ability to do that

3:33:35.760 --> 3:33:40.160
 now as you mentioned the internet could change that the fact that we had representatives that

3:33:40.160 --> 3:33:44.960
 had to ride a horse from one town hall to the other one to see what the colony would do um that

3:33:44.960 --> 3:33:51.280
 we stopped having this kind of developmental um propositional development process when the

3:33:51.280 --> 3:33:54.640
 town hall ended the fact that we have not used the internet to recreate this is

3:33:54.640 --> 3:33:58.800
 uh somewhere between insane and

3:34:02.080 --> 3:34:07.840
 aligned with class interests i would push back to say that the internet has those things it just

3:34:07.840 --> 3:34:13.920
 has a lot of other things i feel like the internet has places where that encourage synthesis of

3:34:13.920 --> 3:34:21.200
 competing ideas and uh sense making which is what we're talking about is just that it's also

3:34:21.200 --> 3:34:25.520
 flooded with a bunch of other systems that perhaps are out competing it under current

3:34:25.520 --> 3:34:31.760
 incentives perhaps has to do with capitalism in the market is the linux is awesome right and

3:34:32.480 --> 3:34:37.840
 wikipedia and places where you have and they have problems but places where you have open source

3:34:37.840 --> 3:34:42.400
 sharing of information vetting of information towards collective building is that building

3:34:42.400 --> 3:34:49.360
 something like like how much has that affected our court systems or our policing systems or our

3:34:49.360 --> 3:34:54.880
 military systems or first of all i think a lot but not not enough i i i think that's something

3:34:54.880 --> 3:35:00.960
 i told you offline yesterday's uh perhaps there's a whole nother discussion but i i don't think

3:35:00.960 --> 3:35:08.240
 we're quite quantifying the impact on the world the positive impact of wikipedia you said the

3:35:08.240 --> 3:35:15.200
 policing the i mean i just i just think the amount of um empathy that wikipedia like knowledge

3:35:15.200 --> 3:35:27.520
 i think can't help but lead to empathy just knowing okay just knowing okay i'll give you some pieces

3:35:27.520 --> 3:35:32.720
 of information knowing how many people died in various awards that already that delta when you

3:35:32.720 --> 3:35:37.840
 have millions of people have that knowledge it's like it's a little like slap in the face like oh

3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:44.560
 like my boyfriend or girlfriend breaking up with me is not such a big deal when millions

3:35:44.560 --> 3:35:49.280
 of people were tortured you know like just a little bit and when a lot of people know that

3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:55.520
 because of wikipedia uh or the effect their second order effect of wikipedia which is

3:35:56.080 --> 3:36:03.360
 it's not that necessarily people read wikipedia it's like youtubers who don't really know stuff

3:36:03.360 --> 3:36:09.520
 that well will thoroughly read a wikipedia article and create a compelling video describing

3:36:09.520 --> 3:36:14.640
 that wikipedia article that then millions of people watch and they understand that holy

3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:18.720
 shit a lot of there was such a first of all there was such a thing as world war two in world war

3:36:18.720 --> 3:36:25.440
 one okay like they can at least like learn about it they can learn about this was like recent they

3:36:25.440 --> 3:36:30.720
 can learn about slavery they can learn about all kinds of injustices in the world and that i think

3:36:30.720 --> 3:36:39.120
 has a lot of effects to our to the way whether you're a police officer uh a a lawyer a judge

3:36:39.120 --> 3:36:48.960
 in the jury or just a regular civilian citizen the way you approach the every other communication

3:36:48.960 --> 3:36:53.520
 you engage in even if the system of that communication is very much flawed so i think

3:36:53.520 --> 3:36:57.440
 there's a huge positive effect on wikipedia that's my case for wikipedia so you should

3:36:57.440 --> 3:37:03.920
 donate to wikipedia i i'm a huge fan but there's very few systems like it which is sad to me

3:37:03.920 --> 3:37:12.080
 me so i think it's it would be a useful exercise for any uh listener of the show to

3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:19.760
 really try to run the dialectical synthesis process with regard to uh a topic like this

3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:29.760
 and take the um techno concerned perspective with regard to uh information tech that folks

3:37:29.760 --> 3:37:34.480
 like tristan harris take and say what are all of the things that are getting worse

3:37:35.200 --> 3:37:39.360
 and what and are any of them following an exponential curve and how much worse how

3:37:39.360 --> 3:37:47.200
 quickly could that be and then and do that fully without mitigating it then take the

3:37:47.200 --> 3:37:50.720
 techno optimist perspective and see what things are getting better in a way that

3:37:51.840 --> 3:37:57.600
 occurs well or diamondus or someone might do and try to take that perspective fully and say

3:37:57.600 --> 3:38:01.280
 are some of those things exponential what could that portend and then try to hold all that at

3:38:01.280 --> 3:38:10.400
 the same time and i think there are ways in which depending upon the metrics we're looking at

3:38:10.400 --> 3:38:15.040
 things are getting worse on exponential curves and better on exponential curves for different

3:38:15.040 --> 3:38:20.560
 metrics at the same time which which i hold is the destabilization of previous system

3:38:20.560 --> 3:38:25.200
 and either an emergence to a better system or collapse to a lower order are both possible

3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:33.760
 and so i want my optimism not to be about my assessment i want my assessment to be just as

3:38:33.760 --> 3:38:40.240
 fucking clear as it can be i want my optimism to be what inspires the solution process on that

3:38:40.240 --> 3:38:46.080
 clear assessment so i never i never want to apply optimism in the sense making right i want to just

3:38:46.080 --> 3:38:51.760
 try to be clear if anything i want to make sure that the challenges are really well understood

3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:58.080
 but that's in service of an optimism that there are good potentials even if i don't know what

3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:03.600
 they are that are worth seeking right there's kind of a there is a some sense of optimism

3:39:03.600 --> 3:39:09.280
 that's required to even try to innovate really hard problems but then i want to take my pessimism

3:39:09.280 --> 3:39:13.520
 and read to my own optimism to see is that solution not going to work does it have second

3:39:13.520 --> 3:39:19.120
 order effects and then not get not get upset by that because i then come back to how to make it

3:39:19.120 --> 3:39:23.120
 better so that just a relationship between optimism and pessimism and the dialectic of how

3:39:23.120 --> 3:39:30.480
 they how they can work so when i of course we can say that wikipedia is a pretty awesome example

3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:36.560
 of a thing we can look at the places where it has limits or has failed where

3:39:38.800 --> 3:39:44.160
 on a celebrity topic or corporate interest topic you can pay wikipedia editors to edit

3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:48.960
 more frequently and various things like that but you can also see where there's a lot of information

3:39:48.960 --> 3:39:53.360
 that was kind of decentralized created that is good information that is more easily accessible

3:39:53.360 --> 3:39:57.600
 to people than everybody buying their own encyclopedia britannica walking down to the library

3:39:57.600 --> 3:40:05.760
 and that can be updated in real time faster and i think you're very right that the business model

3:40:05.760 --> 3:40:13.840
 is a big difference because wikipedia is not a for profit corporation it is a it's tending to

3:40:13.840 --> 3:40:18.240
 the information commons and it doesn't have an agenda other than tending to the information

3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:25.200
 commons and i think the two masters issue is a tricky one when i'm trying to optimize for very

3:40:25.200 --> 3:40:31.840
 different kinds of things where i have to sacrifice one for the other and i can't find

3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:36.880
 synergistic satisfies which one and if i have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholder

3:40:36.880 --> 3:40:45.120
 uh profit maximization and you know what what does that end up creating i think the ad model

3:40:45.120 --> 3:40:50.880
 that silicon valley took um i think jaren lanie or i don't know if you've had him on the show

3:40:50.880 --> 3:40:58.240
 but he has interesting assessment of the nature of the ad model um silicon valley wanting to

3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:04.240
 support capitalism and entrepreneurs to make things but uh also the belief that information

3:41:04.240 --> 3:41:10.080
 should be free and also the network dynamics where the more people you got on you got increased value

3:41:10.080 --> 3:41:13.840
 per user per capita as more people got on so you didn't want to do anything to slow the rate of

3:41:13.840 --> 3:41:19.760
 adoption um some places actually you know pay pal paying people money to join the network because

3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:24.720
 the uh value of the network would be there'd be a metcalf like dynamic proportional to the square

3:41:24.720 --> 3:41:31.840
 of the total number of users so um the ad model made sense of how do we make it free but also be

3:41:31.840 --> 3:41:37.840
 a business get everybody on but not really thinking about what it would mean to and this

3:41:37.840 --> 3:41:44.080
 is now the whole idea that if you aren't paying for the product you are the product um if the if

3:41:44.080 --> 3:41:48.960
 they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholder maximize profit their customer as the

3:41:48.960 --> 3:41:55.600
 advertiser the user who it's being built for is to do behavioral mod for them for advertisers

3:41:56.560 --> 3:42:01.440
 that's a whole different thing than that same type of tech could have been if applied with a

3:42:01.440 --> 3:42:11.680
 different business model or a different purpose um i think there's because facebook and google and

3:42:11.680 --> 3:42:17.520
 other information and communication platforms end up harvesting data about user behavior that allows

3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:22.720
 them to model who the people are in a way that gives them more sometimes specific information

3:42:22.720 --> 3:42:30.800
 and behavioral information than even a therapist or a doctor or a lawyer or a priest might have in

3:42:30.800 --> 3:42:36.240
 a different setting they basically are accessing privileged information there should be a fiduciary

3:42:36.240 --> 3:42:42.800
 responsibility and in normal fiduciary law if there's this principal agent thing if you are a

3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:49.200
 uh principal and i'm an agent on your behalf i don't have a game theoretic relationship with you

3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:52.960
 right if you're sharing something with me and i'm the priest or i'm the therapist i'm never

3:42:52.960 --> 3:42:58.960
 going to use that information to try to sell you a used car or whatever the thing is but facebook is

3:42:58.960 --> 3:43:04.160
 gathering massive amounts of privileged information and using it to modify people's behavior for a

3:43:04.160 --> 3:43:08.960
 behavior that they didn't sign up for wanting the behavior but what the corporation did so i think

3:43:10.000 --> 3:43:15.920
 this is an example of the physical tech evolving in the context of the previous social tech where

3:43:15.920 --> 3:43:22.160
 it's being shaped in particular ways and here unlike Wikipedia that evolved for the the information

3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:27.920
 commons this evolved for fulfilling particular agentic purpose most people when they're on facebook

3:43:27.920 --> 3:43:32.320
 think it's just a tool that they're using they don't realize it's an agent right it is a corporation

3:43:32.320 --> 3:43:38.000
 with a profit motive and um and as i'm interacting with it it has a goal for me different than my

3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:42.880
 goal for myself and i might want to be on for a short period of time its goal is maximize time on

3:43:42.880 --> 3:43:48.960
 site and so there is a rivalry that is taken but where there should be a fiduciary contract

3:43:48.960 --> 3:43:57.840
 i think that's actually a huge deal and i think if we said could we apply facebook like technology

3:43:57.840 --> 3:44:08.560
 to develop people's citizenry capacity right to develop their personal health and well being

3:44:08.560 --> 3:44:14.960
 in habits as well as their cognitive understanding the complexity with which they can process

3:44:14.960 --> 3:44:22.080
 the health of their relationships um that would be amazing to start to explore and this is now

3:44:22.080 --> 3:44:29.040
 the thesis that we started to discuss before is every time there is a major step function in

3:44:29.040 --> 3:44:34.720
 the physical tech it absolutes the previous social tech and the new social tech has to emerge

3:44:35.920 --> 3:44:41.280
 what i would say is that when we look at the nation state level of the world today the more

3:44:41.280 --> 3:44:47.360
 more top down authoritarian nation states are as the exponential tech started to emerge the digital

3:44:47.360 --> 3:44:54.080
 technology started to emerge they were in a position for better long term planning and better

3:44:54.080 --> 3:44:58.960
 coordination and so the authoritarian state started applying the exponential tech intentionally

3:44:58.960 --> 3:45:03.680
 to make more effective authoritarian states and that's everything from like an internet of things

3:45:03.680 --> 3:45:09.920
 surveillance system going into machine learning systems to the sesame credit system to all those

3:45:09.920 --> 3:45:16.640
 types of things and so they're upgrading their social tech using the exponential tech otherwise

3:45:16.640 --> 3:45:24.640
 within a nation state like the us but democratic open societies the countries the states are not

3:45:24.640 --> 3:45:29.280
 directing the technology in a way that makes a better open society meaning better emergent order

3:45:29.840 --> 3:45:34.480
 they're saying well the corporations are doing that and the state is doing the relatively little

3:45:34.480 --> 3:45:38.000
 thing it would do aligned with the previous corporate law that no longer is relevant because

3:45:38.000 --> 3:45:43.440
 there wasn't fiduciary responsibility for things like that there wasn't antitrust because this creates

3:45:43.440 --> 3:45:48.960
 functional monopolies because of network dynamics right where youtube has more users than bimeo and

3:45:48.960 --> 3:45:53.200
 every other video player together amazon has a bigger percentage of market share than all of the

3:45:53.200 --> 3:45:59.440
 other markets together you get one big dog per vertical because of network effect which is a

3:45:59.440 --> 3:46:03.520
 kind of organic monopoly that the previous antitrust law didn't even have a place that wasn't a thing

3:46:03.520 --> 3:46:10.240
 anti monopoly was only something that emerged in the space of government contracts so um

3:46:11.360 --> 3:46:16.480
 so what we see is the new exponential technology is being directed by authoritarian nation states

3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:20.240
 to make better authoritarian nation states and by corporations to make more powerful corporations

3:46:20.880 --> 3:46:25.440
 the powerful corporations when we think about the scottish enlightenment when the idea of

3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:30.000
 markets was being advanced the modern kind of ideas of markets the biggest corporation

3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:36.640
 was tiny compared to what the biggest corporation today is so the asymmetry of it relative to

3:46:36.640 --> 3:46:43.120
 people was tiny and the asymmetry now in terms of the total technology it employs total amount of

3:46:43.120 --> 3:46:50.240
 money total amount of information processing is so many orders of magnitude and rather than

3:46:50.240 --> 3:46:57.040
 there be demand for an authentic thing that creates a basis for supply as supply started to get way

3:46:57.040 --> 3:47:00.720
 more coordinated and powerful and the demand wasn't coordinated because you don't have a labor union

3:47:00.720 --> 3:47:05.120
 of all the customers working together but you do have a coordination on the supply side supply

3:47:05.120 --> 3:47:09.120
 started to recognize that it could manufacture demand it could make people want shit that they

3:47:09.120 --> 3:47:13.520
 didn't want before that maybe wouldn't increase their happiness in a meaningful way might increase

3:47:13.520 --> 3:47:19.600
 addiction addiction is a very good way to manufacture demand and so as soon as manufactured

3:47:19.600 --> 3:47:25.120
 demand started through this is the cool thing and you have to have it for status or whatever it is

3:47:25.120 --> 3:47:30.800
 is the intelligence of the market was breaking now it's no longer a collective intelligence system

3:47:30.800 --> 3:47:35.760
 that is up regulating real desire for things that are really meaningful you're able to hijack the

3:47:35.760 --> 3:47:40.560
 lower angels of our nature rather than the higher ones the addictive patterns drive those and have

3:47:40.560 --> 3:47:45.200
 people want shit that doesn't actually make them happier make the world better and so we really

3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:51.200
 also have to we have to update our theory of markets because a behavioral econ showed that

3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:56.320
 homo economicus the rational actor is not really a thing but particularly at greater and greater

3:47:56.320 --> 3:48:00.880
 scale can't really be a thing voluntarism isn't a thing where if my corporate if my company doesn't

3:48:00.880 --> 3:48:04.480
 want to advertise on facebook i just will lose to the companies that do because that's where

3:48:04.480 --> 3:48:09.280
 all the fucking attention is and so then i can say it's voluntary but it's not really if there's

3:48:09.280 --> 3:48:16.640
 a functional monopoly same if i'm going to sell on amazon or things like that so um what i would

3:48:16.640 --> 3:48:23.760
 say is that these corporations are becoming more powerful than nation states in some ways and

3:48:27.280 --> 3:48:34.800
 they are also debasing the integrity of the nation states the open societies so the democracies

3:48:34.800 --> 3:48:40.480
 are getting weaker as a result of exponential tech and the kind of new tech companies that are

3:48:40.480 --> 3:48:45.040
 kind of a new feudalism tech feudalism because it's not a democracy inside of a tech company

3:48:45.040 --> 3:48:50.400
 or the supply and demand relationship when you have manufactured demand and kind of

3:48:50.400 --> 3:48:55.840
 monopoly type functions and so we have basically a new feudalism controlling exponential tech

3:48:55.840 --> 3:49:01.520
 and authoritarian nation states controlling it and those attractors are both shitty and so i'm

3:49:01.520 --> 3:49:07.520
 interested in the application of exponential tech to making better social tech that makes

3:49:07.520 --> 3:49:13.920
 emergent order possible and where then that emergent order can bind and direct the exponential

3:49:13.920 --> 3:49:20.720
 tech in fundamentally healthy not x risk oriented directions i think the relationship of social

3:49:20.720 --> 3:49:24.880
 tech and physical tech can make it i think we can actually use the physical tech to make better

3:49:24.880 --> 3:49:30.720
 social tech but it's not given that we do if we don't make better social tech then i think the

3:49:30.720 --> 3:49:35.440
 physical tech empowers really shitty social tech that is not a world that we want i don't know if

3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:40.960
 it's the road we want to go down but i tend to believe that the market will create exactly the

3:49:40.960 --> 3:49:45.120
 thing you're talking about which i feel like there's a lot of money to be made in creating

3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:56.080
 a social tech that creates a better citizen that creates a better human being

3:49:57.920 --> 3:50:05.440
 this uh the your description of facebook and so on which is a system that creates addiction

3:50:05.440 --> 3:50:14.560
 which manufacturers demand is not obviously inherently the consequence of the market like i

3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:19.440
 feel like that's the the first stage of us like baby deer trying to figure out how to use the

3:50:19.440 --> 3:50:25.520
 internet i i feel like there's much more money to be made with something that creates

3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:34.720
 compersion and love honestly i mean i i really from we can have this i can make the business

3:50:34.720 --> 3:50:39.600
 case for it i don't know i don't think we want to really have that discussion but don't do you

3:50:39.600 --> 3:50:45.200
 have some hope that that's the case and i guess if not then how do we fix the system of markets that

3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:51.280
 works so well for the united states for so long like i said every social tech worked for a while

3:50:51.280 --> 3:50:56.640
 like tribalism worked well for two or three hundred thousand years i think social tech has

3:50:56.640 --> 3:51:02.400
 to keep evolving the social technologies with which we organize and coordinate our behavior

3:51:02.400 --> 3:51:08.880
 have to keep evolving as our physical tech does um so i think the thing that we call markets

3:51:10.640 --> 3:51:17.200
 of course we can try to say oh even biology runs on markets and but the thing that we call

3:51:17.200 --> 3:51:22.640
 markets the underlying theory homo economicist demand driving supply that thing broke

3:51:23.440 --> 3:51:29.440
 it broke with scale in particular um and a few other things so it needs updated in a really

3:51:29.440 --> 3:51:37.360
 fundamental way um i think there's something even deeper than making money happening that in some

3:51:37.360 --> 3:51:44.160
 ways will obsolete money making i think capitalism is not about business

3:51:44.160 --> 3:51:51.280
 so if you think about business i'm going to produce a good or a service that people want and

3:51:51.280 --> 3:51:56.240
 bring it to the market so that people get access to that good or service that's the world of business

3:51:57.120 --> 3:52:03.200
 but that's not capitalism capitalism is the management and allocation of capital which

3:52:04.400 --> 3:52:07.760
 financial services was a tiny percentage of the total market has become a huge

3:52:07.760 --> 3:52:13.040
 percentage of the total market it's a different creature so if i was in business and i was producing

3:52:13.040 --> 3:52:17.200
 a good or service and i was saving up enough money that i started to be able to invest that money and

3:52:17.200 --> 3:52:23.440
 gain interest or do things like that i start realizing i'm making more money on my money

3:52:23.440 --> 3:52:27.600
 than i'm making on producing the goods and services so i stop even paying attention to goods and

3:52:27.600 --> 3:52:32.400
 services and start paying attention to making money on money and how do i utilize capital to

3:52:32.400 --> 3:52:37.200
 create more capital and capital gives me more optionality because i can buy anything with it

3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:47.280
 than a particular good or service that only some people want capitalism more capital ended up

3:52:47.280 --> 3:52:54.640
 meaning more control i could put more people under my employment i could buy larger pieces of land

3:52:54.640 --> 3:52:58.480
 novel access to resource mines and put more technology under my employment so it meant

3:52:58.480 --> 3:53:07.600
 increased agency and also increased control i think attentionalism is even more powerful

3:53:07.600 --> 3:53:14.560
 so rather than enslave people where the people kind of always want to get away and put in

3:53:14.560 --> 3:53:19.040
 the least work they can there's a way in which economic servitude was just more profitable

3:53:19.040 --> 3:53:24.800
 than slavery right have the people work even harder voluntarily because they want to get ahead

3:53:24.800 --> 3:53:32.080
 and nobody has to be there to whip them or control them or whatever this is a a cynical

3:53:32.080 --> 3:53:43.520
 take but a meaningful take so people so capital is a way to influence human behavior right and yet

3:53:45.040 --> 3:53:50.960
 where people still feel free in some meaningful way they they're not feeling like they're going

3:53:50.960 --> 3:53:54.880
 to be punished by the state if they don't do something it's like punished by the market be a

3:53:54.880 --> 3:53:59.520
 homelessness or something but the market is this invisible thing i can't put an agent on so it feels

3:53:59.520 --> 3:54:09.600
 like free and so if if you want to affect people's behavior and still have them feel

3:54:09.600 --> 3:54:14.880
 free capital ends up being a way to do that but i think affecting their attention is even deeper

3:54:14.880 --> 3:54:21.760
 because if i can affect their attention i can both affect what they want and what they believe

3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:25.600
 and what they feel and we statistically know this very clearly facebook has done studies

3:54:25.600 --> 3:54:32.480
 that based on changing the feed it can change beliefs emotional dispositions etc and so i think

3:54:32.480 --> 3:54:39.040
 there's a way that the the harvest and directing of attention is even a more powerful system than

3:54:39.040 --> 3:54:43.920
 capitalism it is effective in capitalism to generate capital but i think it also generates

3:54:43.920 --> 3:54:55.440
 influence beyond what capital can do and so do we want to have some groups utilizing that type

3:54:55.440 --> 3:55:04.720
 of tech to direct other people's attention if so um towards what towards what metrics of what a good

3:55:04.720 --> 3:55:09.200
 civilization and good human life would be what's the oversight process what is the

3:55:09.200 --> 3:55:16.000
 transparency i can i can i can answer all the things you're mentioning uh i i can build i

3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:22.960
 guarantee you if i am not such a lazy ass i'll be part of the many people doing this as transparency

3:55:22.960 --> 3:55:33.360
 and control i get to giving control to individual people okay so maybe the corporation has coordination

3:55:33.360 --> 3:55:38.720
 on its goals that all of its customers or users together don't have so there's some asymmetry

3:55:38.720 --> 3:55:45.840
 where it's uh asymmetry of its goals but maybe i could actually help all of the customers to

3:55:45.840 --> 3:55:52.400
 coordinate almost like a labor union or whatever by informing and educating them adequately about

3:55:52.400 --> 3:55:57.280
 the effects the externalities on them if this is not toxic waste going into the ocean of the

3:55:57.280 --> 3:56:02.720
 atmosphere it's their their minds their beings their families their relationships um such that

3:56:02.720 --> 3:56:12.400
 they will in group change their behavior and um i think the i one way of saying what you're saying

3:56:12.400 --> 3:56:20.880
 i think is that you think that you can rescue homo economicus from uh the the rational actor

3:56:20.880 --> 3:56:24.720
 that will pursue all the goods and services and choose the best one at the best price the kind

3:56:24.720 --> 3:56:29.680
 of rand von mises hayek that you can rescue that from dan arielli and behavioral econ that says

3:56:29.680 --> 3:56:33.520
 that's actually not how people make choices they make it based on status hacking largely

3:56:33.520 --> 3:56:39.600
 whether it's good for them or not in the long term and the large asymmetric corporation can run

3:56:39.600 --> 3:56:44.160
 propaganda and narrative warfare that hits people's status buttons and their limbic hijacks and

3:56:44.160 --> 3:56:50.320
 their lots of other things in ways that they can't even perceive that are happening um they're not

3:56:50.320 --> 3:56:54.560
 paying attention to that the site is employing psychologists and split testing and whatever

3:56:54.560 --> 3:57:01.040
 else so you're saying i think we can recover homo economicus and not just through a single

3:57:01.040 --> 3:57:07.120
 like mechanism technology there's there's the uh not to keep mentioning the guy but platforms like

3:57:07.120 --> 3:57:16.800
 georogan and so on that that make help make viral the ways that the education of negative

3:57:16.800 --> 3:57:26.480
 externalities can become viral in this world so interestingly i actually agree with you that

3:57:27.920 --> 3:57:34.800
 i got him that we four and a half hours in that we can that can do some good all right well see

3:57:34.800 --> 3:57:39.440
 what you're talking about is the application of tech here broadcast tech where you can speak to a

3:57:39.440 --> 3:57:43.440
 lot of people and that's not going to be strong enough because the different people need spoken

3:57:43.440 --> 3:57:47.120
 too differently which means it has to be different voices that get amplified to those audiences more

3:57:47.120 --> 3:57:51.680
 like facebook's tech but nonetheless we'll start with broadcast tech plants the first seed and then

3:57:51.680 --> 3:57:57.600
 the word of mouth is a powerful thing you need to do the first broadcast shotgun and then it like

3:57:57.600 --> 3:58:02.960
 lands a catapult of whatever i don't know what the right weapon is but then it just spreads the word

3:58:02.960 --> 3:58:07.760
 of mouth through all kinds of tech including facebook so let's come back to the fundamental

3:58:07.760 --> 3:58:14.640
 thing the fundamental thing is we want to kind of order at various scales from the conflicting

3:58:14.640 --> 3:58:22.640
 parts of ourselves actually having more harmony than they might have to family extended family

3:58:22.640 --> 3:58:28.160
 local all the way up to global we want emergent order where our choices

3:58:30.480 --> 3:58:37.040
 have more alignment right we want that to be emergent rather than imposed or rather than

3:58:37.040 --> 3:58:40.320
 we want fundamentally different things or make totally different sense of the world where

3:58:41.280 --> 3:58:47.360
 warfare of some kind becomes the only solution emergent order requires us in our choice making

3:58:47.360 --> 3:58:53.040
 requires us being able to have related sense making and related meaning making processes

3:58:54.880 --> 3:59:02.480
 can we apply digital technologies and exponential tech in general to try to increase the capacity

3:59:02.480 --> 3:59:06.160
 to do that where the technology called a town hall the social tech that we'd all get together

3:59:06.160 --> 3:59:11.120
 and talk obviously is very scale limited and it's also oriented to geography rather than

3:59:11.120 --> 3:59:16.800
 networks of aligned interest can we build new better versions of those types of things and

3:59:16.800 --> 3:59:23.200
 going back to the idea that a democracy or participatory governance depends upon comprehensive

3:59:23.200 --> 3:59:27.040
 education in the science of government which include being able to understand things like

3:59:27.040 --> 3:59:31.280
 asymmetric information warfare on the side of governments and how the people can organize

3:59:31.280 --> 3:59:38.880
 adequately can you utilize some of the technologies now to be able to support increased comprehensive

3:59:38.880 --> 3:59:45.200
 education of the people and maybe comprehensive informatness so both fixing the decay in both

3:59:45.200 --> 3:59:49.520
 education in the fourth estate that have happened so the people can start self organizing to then

3:59:50.240 --> 3:59:56.080
 influence the corporations the nation states to do different things and or build new ones

3:59:56.080 --> 4:00:01.680
 themselves yeah fundamentally that's the thing that has to happen we the exponential tech gives

4:00:01.680 --> 4:00:06.800
 us a novel problem landscape that the world never had the nuke gave us a novel problem landscape

4:00:06.800 --> 4:00:12.720
 and so that required this whole Bretton Woods world the exponential tech gives us novel problem

4:00:12.720 --> 4:00:18.080
 landscape our existing problem solving processes aren't doing a good job we have had more countries

4:00:18.080 --> 4:00:22.480
 get nukes we haven't a nuclear deep proliferation we haven't achieved any of the UN sustainable

4:00:22.480 --> 4:00:27.840
 development goals we haven't kept any of the new categories of tech for making arms races so our

4:00:27.840 --> 4:00:34.000
 global coordination is not adequate to the problem landscape so we need fundamentally better problem

4:00:34.000 --> 4:00:38.640
 solving processes a market or a state is a problem solving process we need better ones that can do

4:00:38.640 --> 4:00:44.000
 the speed and scale of the current issues right now speed is one of the other big things is that

4:00:44.000 --> 4:00:49.120
 by the time we regulated DDT out of existence or cigarettes not for people under 18 they'd

4:00:49.120 --> 4:00:54.800
 already killed so many people and we let the market do the thing but as Elon has made the

4:00:54.800 --> 4:01:00.000
 point that won't work for AI by the time we recognize afterwards that we have an auto

4:01:00.000 --> 4:01:03.920
 poetic AI that's a problem you won't be able to reverse it that there's a number of things that

4:01:04.560 --> 4:01:09.200
 when you're dealing with tech that is either self replicating and disintermediate humans to keep

4:01:09.200 --> 4:01:15.440
 going doesn't need humans to keep going or you have tech that just has exponentially fast effects

4:01:15.440 --> 4:01:21.920
 your regulation has to come early it can't come after the effects have happened the negative

4:01:21.920 --> 4:01:25.600
 effects have happened if because the negative effects could be too big too quickly so we

4:01:25.600 --> 4:01:31.840
 basically need new problem solving processes that do better at being able to internalize

4:01:31.840 --> 4:01:36.640
 externality solve the problems on the right time scale and the right geographic scale

4:01:37.520 --> 4:01:42.320
 and those new processes to not be imposed have to emerge from people wanting them

4:01:42.320 --> 4:01:47.600
 and being able to participate in their development which is what I would call kind of

4:01:47.600 --> 4:01:52.480
 a new cultural enlightenment or renaissance that has to happen where people start understanding

4:01:52.480 --> 4:01:58.880
 the new power that exponential tech offers the way that it is actually damaging

4:01:59.680 --> 4:02:05.200
 current governance structures that we care about and creating an extra scale landscape but could

4:02:05.200 --> 4:02:12.320
 also be redirected towards more protopic purposes and then saying how do we rebuild new social

4:02:12.320 --> 4:02:16.880
 institutions what are adequate social institutions where we can do participatory governance at

4:02:16.880 --> 4:02:24.080
 scale and time and how can the people actually participate to build those things I the the

4:02:24.080 --> 4:02:32.880
 solution that I see working requires a process like that and the result maximizes love so again

4:02:32.880 --> 4:02:38.880
 Elon would be right that love is the answer let me take it back from the scale of societies

4:02:40.000 --> 4:02:48.240
 to the scale that's far far more important which is the scale of family you've written a blog post

4:02:48.240 --> 4:02:57.120
 about your dad we have various flavors of relationships with our fathers what have you

4:02:57.120 --> 4:03:05.760
 learned about life when your dad well people can read the blog post and see a lot of individual

4:03:05.760 --> 4:03:10.800
 things that I learned that I really appreciated if I was to kind of summarize at a high level

4:03:14.640 --> 4:03:22.160
 I had a really incredible dad like very very unusually a positive set of experiences

4:03:22.160 --> 4:03:27.520
 as he was committed we were homeschooled and he was committed to work from home to be available

4:03:27.520 --> 4:03:30.080
 and like prioritize fathering in a really deep way

4:03:35.360 --> 4:03:41.840
 and you know as a super gifted super loving very unique man he also had his unique issues that

4:03:41.840 --> 4:03:46.640
 were part of what crafted the unique brilliance and those things often go together and I say that

4:03:46.640 --> 4:03:52.880
 because I think I had had some unusual gifts and also some unusual difficulties and I think

4:03:53.680 --> 4:03:59.200
 it's useful for everybody to know their path probably has both of those but

4:04:01.600 --> 4:04:06.240
 if I was to say kind of at the essence of one of the things my dad taught me across a lot of

4:04:06.240 --> 4:04:14.000
 lessons was like a the intersection of self empowerment ideas and practices that self empower

4:04:14.000 --> 4:04:22.720
 towards collective good towards some virtuous purpose beyond the self and he both said that

4:04:22.720 --> 4:04:26.720
 a million different ways taught it in a million different ways when we were doing construction

4:04:26.720 --> 4:04:32.960
 and he was teaching me how to build a house we were putting the wires to the walls before

4:04:32.960 --> 4:04:36.880
 the drywall went on he made sure that the way that we put the wires through is beautiful

4:04:36.880 --> 4:04:44.240
 like the that the height of the holes was similar that we twisted the wires in a particular way

4:04:44.240 --> 4:04:48.880
 that and it's like no one's ever going to see it and he's like if a job's worth doing it's worth

4:04:48.880 --> 4:04:52.720
 doing well and excellence is its own reward and those types of ideas and if there was a really

4:04:52.720 --> 4:04:56.320
 shitty job to do he'd say see the job do the job stay out of the misery just don't indulge

4:04:56.320 --> 4:05:01.920
 any negativity do the things that need done and so there's like a there's an empowerment

4:05:01.920 --> 4:05:11.840
 and a nobility together um and yeah extraordinarily fortunate is there ways you think you could have

4:05:11.840 --> 4:05:20.480
 been a better son is there things you regret it's an interesting question let me first say

4:05:21.280 --> 4:05:29.440
 just as a bit of a criticism that uh what kind of man do you think you are not wearing a suit

4:05:29.440 --> 4:05:38.080
 and tie a real man should exactly uh i grew with your dad on that point you mentioned offline that

4:05:38.080 --> 4:05:41.360
 he suggested a real man should wear a suit and tie

4:05:44.080 --> 4:05:49.600
 but outside of that is there ways you could have been a better son maybe next time on your show

4:05:49.600 --> 4:06:05.520
 i'll wear a suit and tie my dad would be happy about that um please

4:06:12.400 --> 4:06:18.960
 i can answer the question later in life not early um i had just a huge amount of respect

4:06:18.960 --> 4:06:24.320
 and reverence for my dad when i was young so i was asking myself that question a lot so i

4:06:24.320 --> 4:06:28.960
 weren't a lot of things i knew that i wasn't seeking to apply um

4:06:32.000 --> 4:06:36.880
 there was a phase when i went through my kind of individuation differentiation

4:06:37.840 --> 4:06:44.320
 where i had to make him excessively wrong about too many things um i don't think i had to but i did

4:06:44.320 --> 4:06:53.440
 and he had a lot of kind of non standard model beliefs about things whether early

4:06:55.200 --> 4:07:00.080
 kind of ancient civilizations or ideas on evolutionary theory or alternate models of physics and

4:07:01.040 --> 4:07:08.080
 and um and they weren't irrational but they didn't all have the standard of

4:07:08.080 --> 4:07:17.120
 epistemic proof that i would need and i went through and some of more kind of spiritual

4:07:17.120 --> 4:07:29.040
 ideas as well i went through a phase in my early 20s where i kind of had that the attitude that

4:07:29.040 --> 4:07:39.040
 Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens has that can kind of be um like excessively certain and sanctimonious

4:07:40.240 --> 4:07:46.320
 applying their reductionist philosophy of science to everything and kind of brutally dismissive

4:07:47.760 --> 4:07:55.120
 i'm embarrassed by that phase um not to say anything about those men in their path but

4:07:55.120 --> 4:08:04.800
 but for myself and so during that time i was more dismissive of my dad's epistemology than i

4:08:04.800 --> 4:08:09.440
 would have liked to have been i gotta correct that later apologize for it but that's the first

4:08:09.440 --> 4:08:16.240
 thought that came to mind you've written the following i've had the experience countless

4:08:16.240 --> 4:08:25.920
 times making love watching a sunset listening to music feeling the breeze that i would sign up for

4:08:25.920 --> 4:08:34.160
 this whole life and all of its pains just to experience this exact moment this is a kind of

4:08:34.160 --> 4:08:42.400
 worldless knowing it's the most important and real truth i know that experience itself is infinitely

4:08:42.400 --> 4:08:50.880
 meaningful and pain is temporary and seen clearly even the suffering is filled with beauty i've

4:08:50.880 --> 4:08:58.080
 experienced countless lives worth of moments worthy of life such an unreasonable fortune

4:09:00.320 --> 4:09:06.000
 a few words of gratitude from you beautifully written is there some beautiful moments now you

4:09:06.000 --> 4:09:14.240
 have uh experienced countless lives worth of those moments but there are some things that um if you

4:09:14.240 --> 4:09:21.280
 could uh in your darker moments you can go to to relive to remind yourself that the whole ride is

4:09:21.280 --> 4:09:30.880
 worthwhile maybe skip the making love part we don't know about that i mean i i feel i feel

4:09:30.880 --> 4:09:43.600
 unreasonably fortunate that it is a such a humongous list because i mean i feel fortunate to

4:09:43.600 --> 4:09:49.360
 have like had exposure to practices and philosophies in a way of seeing things it makes me see things

4:09:49.360 --> 4:09:54.880
 that way so i can take response way for seeing things in that way and not taking for granted

4:09:54.880 --> 4:09:58.640
 really wonderful things but i can't take credit for being exposed to the philosophies that even

4:09:58.640 --> 4:10:09.520
 gave me that possibility um you know it's not just with my wife it's with every person who i

4:10:09.520 --> 4:10:14.240
 really love when we're talking i look at their face i in the context of a conversation feel

4:10:14.240 --> 4:10:19.760
 overwhelmed by how lucky i am to get to know them and like that there's never been someone like them

4:10:19.760 --> 4:10:23.360
 in all of history and there never will be again and they might be gone tomorrow i might be gone

4:10:23.360 --> 4:10:28.160
 tomorrow and like i get this moment with them and when you take in the uniqueness of that fully

4:10:28.160 --> 4:10:37.360
 and the beauty of it it's overwhelmingly beautiful and you remember the first time i did a big dose

4:10:37.360 --> 4:10:45.760
 of mushrooms and i was looking at a tree for a long time and i was just crying with overwhelming

4:10:45.760 --> 4:10:48.960
 how beautiful the tree was and it was a tree outside the front of my house that i'd walk

4:10:48.960 --> 4:10:54.720
 by a million times and never looked at like this and it wasn't the dose of mushrooms where

4:10:54.720 --> 4:11:00.320
 where i was hallucinating like where the tree was purple like the tree still looked like if i had

4:11:00.320 --> 4:11:05.600
 to describe it say it's green and it has leaves looks like this but it was way fucking more beautiful

4:11:05.600 --> 4:11:10.320
 like like capturing than it normally was and i'm like why is it so beautiful if i would describe

4:11:10.320 --> 4:11:16.560
 it the same way and i realized i had no thoughts taking me anywhere else yeah like what it seemed

4:11:16.560 --> 4:11:19.920
 like the mushrooms were doing was just actually shutting the narrative off that would have me

4:11:19.920 --> 4:11:24.320
 be distracted so i could really see the tree and then i'm like fuck when i get off these mushrooms

4:11:24.320 --> 4:11:28.160
 i'm going to practice seeing the tree because it's always that beautiful and i just miss it

4:11:29.040 --> 4:11:33.440
 and so i practice being with it and quieting the rest of the mind and then being like wow

4:11:33.440 --> 4:11:39.200
 and and if it's not mushrooms like people have peak experiences where they'll see life and how

4:11:39.200 --> 4:11:45.520
 incredible it is it's always there it's funny that i had this exact same experience and the

4:11:46.160 --> 4:11:51.920
 on quite a lot of mushrooms just sitting alone and looking at a tree and exactly as you described it

4:11:51.920 --> 4:12:00.080
 uh appreciating the beauty undistorted beauty of it and it's funny to me that here's two humans

4:12:00.080 --> 4:12:05.040
 very different with very different journeys where at some moment in time both looking at a tree like

4:12:05.040 --> 4:12:13.200
 idiots for hours and just in awe and and happy to be alive and yeah and uh even just that moment

4:12:13.200 --> 4:12:20.080
 alone is is worth living for but you did say humans and we have a moment together as two humans

4:12:20.080 --> 4:12:27.760
 and you mentioned shots that uh well have to ask what uh what are we looking at when i went to go

4:12:28.640 --> 4:12:32.800
 get a smoothie before coming here i got you a keto smoothie that you didn't want because you're not

4:12:32.800 --> 4:12:38.880
 just keto but fasting but i saw the thing with you and your dad where you did uh shots together

4:12:38.880 --> 4:12:46.080
 yeah and this place happened to have shots of um ginger turmeric cayenne juice of some kind and so

4:12:46.080 --> 4:12:51.120
 i with some himaly and salt i didn't necessarily plan it for being on the show i just brought it

4:12:51.120 --> 4:12:57.520
 wow but we can we can do it that way i think we should we shall uh we shall toast like heroes

4:12:58.480 --> 4:13:04.720
 daniel it's a huge honor what do we toast to we toast to this moment this this this unique

4:13:04.720 --> 4:13:09.200
 moment that we get to share together i'm very grateful to be here in this moment with you and

4:13:09.200 --> 4:13:15.920
 uh yeah gratefully you invited me here we met for the first time and i will never be the same

4:13:17.280 --> 4:13:19.200
 for the good and the bad but i am

4:13:22.720 --> 4:13:27.440
 that is really interesting that feels way healthier than the vodka my dad and i were drinking

4:13:29.200 --> 4:13:34.000
 so i feel like a better man already daniel this is one of the best conversations i've ever had

4:13:34.000 --> 4:13:39.360
 i can't wait to have many more likewise this is uh it's been an amazing experience thank you for

4:13:39.360 --> 4:13:43.520
 wasting all your time today i want to say in terms of what you're mentioning about

4:13:44.800 --> 4:13:52.800
 like the that you work in machine learning and the optimism that wants to look at the issues

4:13:52.800 --> 4:13:58.160
 but wants to look at how this increased technological power could be applied to solving them and that

4:13:58.160 --> 4:14:04.400
 even thinking about the broadcast of like can i help people understand the issues better and help

4:14:04.400 --> 4:14:11.360
 organize them like fundamentally you're you're oriented like wikipedia what i see to really try

4:14:11.360 --> 4:14:18.400
 to tend to the information commons without another agentic interest distorting it and for you to be

4:14:18.400 --> 4:14:25.280
 able to get guys like lee smolen and roger pennrose and like the the the greatest thinkers of

4:14:25.280 --> 4:14:30.720
 litter alive and you know have them on the show and most people would never be exposed to them and

4:14:30.720 --> 4:14:35.920
 talk about it in a way that people can understand uh i think it's an incredible service i think you're

4:14:35.920 --> 4:14:41.760
 doing great work so i was really happy to hear from you thank you daniel thanks for listening
