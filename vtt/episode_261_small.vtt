00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
 I believe our official scientific worldview is incompatible with the reality of consciousness.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.800
 Do you think we're living in a simulation?

00:06.800 --> 00:09.600
 We could be in the matrix. This could be a very vivid dream.

00:09.600 --> 00:12.560
 There's going to be a few people that are now visualizing a pink elephant.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.240
 A hamster has consciousness.

00:14.240 --> 00:18.960
 Except for cats who are evil automatons that are void of consciousness.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.840
 Consciousness is the basis of moral value, moral concern.

00:23.840 --> 00:31.840
 Do you think there will be a time in like 20, 30, 50 years when we're not morally okay turning off the power to a robot?

00:36.240 --> 00:38.640
 The following is a conversation with Philip Goff,

00:38.640 --> 00:43.520
 philosopher specializing in the philosophy of mind and consciousness.

00:43.520 --> 00:50.320
 He is a panpsychist which means he believes that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature

00:50.320 --> 00:54.080
 of physical reality of all matter in the universe.

00:54.080 --> 00:59.040
 He is the author of Galileo's Error, Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness,

00:59.040 --> 01:03.680
 and is the host of an excellent podcast called Mind Chat.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.560
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.760
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:09.760 --> 01:13.280
 And now here's my conversation with Philip Goff.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.680
 I opened my second podcast conversation with Elon Musk.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.680
 With a question about consciousness and panpsychism.

01:21.680 --> 01:26.400
 The question was, quote, does consciousness permeate all matter?

01:26.400 --> 01:28.560
 I don't know why I opened the conversation this way.

01:28.560 --> 01:30.800
 He looked at me like what the hell is this guy talking about?

01:30.800 --> 01:35.920
 So he said no, because we wouldn't be able to tell if it did or not.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.720
 So it's outside the realm of the scientific method.

01:38.720 --> 01:43.520
 Do you agree or disagree with Elon Musk's answer?

01:43.520 --> 01:48.480
 I disagree. I guess I do think consciousness pervades matter.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.960
 In fact, I think consciousness is the ultimate nature of matter.

01:54.960 --> 02:00.160
 So as for whether it's outside of the scientific method,

02:01.360 --> 02:06.160
 I think there's a fundamental challenge at the heart of the science of consciousness

02:06.160 --> 02:12.960
 that we need to face up to, which is that consciousness is not the ultimate nature.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.560
 It is not publicly observable.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.320
 I can't look inside your head and see your feelings and experiences.

02:21.200 --> 02:26.640
 We know about consciousness not from doing experiments or public observation.

02:27.520 --> 02:32.480
 We just know about it from our immediate awareness of our feelings and experiences.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.440
 So it's qualitative.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.440
 Not quantitative, as you talk about.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.960
 Yeah, that's another aspect of it.

02:38.960 --> 02:45.760
 So there are a couple of reasons consciousness I think is not susceptible to the standard

02:46.320 --> 02:50.320
 or not fully susceptible to the standard scientific approach.

02:50.320 --> 02:54.800
 One reason you've just raised is that it's qualitative rather than quantitative.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.760
 Another reason is it's not publicly observable.

02:57.760 --> 03:03.040
 So I mean, science is used to dealing with unobservables, right?

03:03.040 --> 03:07.920
 Fundamental particles, quantum wave functions, other universes, none of these things are.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.520
 They are observable, but there's an important difference.

03:12.480 --> 03:20.720
 With all these things, we postulate unobservables in order to explain what we can observe, right?

03:20.720 --> 03:24.800
 In the whole of science, that's how it works.

03:25.360 --> 03:29.760
 In the case of consciousness, in the unique case of consciousness,

03:29.760 --> 03:35.040
 the thing we are trying to explain is not publicly observable.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.120
 And that is utterly unique.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.000
 If we want to fully bring science into consciousness,

03:40.000 --> 03:43.520
 we need a more expansive conception of the scientific method.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.080
 So it doesn't mean we can't explain consciousness scientifically,

03:46.720 --> 03:49.200
 but we need to rethink what science is.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.080
 What do you mean publicly, the word publicly observable?

03:52.080 --> 03:55.280
 Is there something interesting to be said about the word publicly?

03:55.280 --> 03:56.720
 I suppose versus privately.

03:57.840 --> 04:06.640
 Yeah, it's tricky to define, but I suppose the data of physics are available to anybody.

04:06.640 --> 04:10.560
 If there were aliens who visited us from another planet,

04:10.560 --> 04:12.880
 maybe they'd have very different sense organs.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.520
 Maybe they'd struggle to understand our art or our music.

04:17.520 --> 04:22.960
 But if they were intelligent enough to do mathematics, they could understand our physics.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.360
 They could look at the data of our experiments.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.440
 They could run the experiments themselves.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.120
 Whereas consciousness, is it observable?

04:31.120 --> 04:32.000
 Is it not observable?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.280
 In a sense, it's observable.

04:33.280 --> 04:37.200
 As you say, we could say it's privately observable.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.520
 I am directly aware of my own feelings and experiences.

04:41.520 --> 04:45.680
 If I'm in pain, it's just right there for me.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.880
 My pain is just totally directly evident to me.

04:49.680 --> 04:54.640
 But you from the outside cannot directly access my pain.

04:54.640 --> 04:59.280
 You can access my pain behavior, or you can ask me,

04:59.280 --> 05:05.360
 but you can't access my pain in the way that I can access my pain.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.640
 So I think that's a distinction.

05:09.520 --> 05:14.160
 It might be difficult to totally pin it down how we define those things,

05:14.160 --> 05:17.520
 but I think there's a fairly clear and very important difference there.

05:17.520 --> 05:23.920
 So you think there's a kind of direct observation that you're able to do of your pain that I'm not.

05:23.920 --> 05:29.440
 So my observation, all the ways in which I can sneak up to observing your pain,

05:29.440 --> 05:32.400
 is indirect versus yours is direct.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.560
 Can you play devil's advocate?

05:34.560 --> 05:38.080
 Is it possible for me to get closer and closer and closer

05:39.200 --> 05:44.800
 to being able to observe your pain, like all the subjective experiences,

05:45.600 --> 05:48.400
 yours in the way that you do?

05:48.400 --> 05:55.920
 Yeah, I mean, of course, it's not that we observe behavior, and then we make an inference.

05:56.480 --> 06:06.080
 We are hardwired to instinctively interpret smiles as happiness, crying as sadness,

06:06.080 --> 06:11.360
 and as we get to know someone, we find it very easy to adopt their perspective,

06:11.360 --> 06:20.960
 get into their shoes, but strictly speaking, all we have perceptual access to is someone's behavior.

06:20.960 --> 06:28.320
 And if you were just strictly speaking, if you were trying to explain someone's behavior,

06:28.880 --> 06:33.520
 those aspects that are publicly observable, I don't think you'd ever have recourse to

06:33.520 --> 06:34.480
 attribute consciousness.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.600
 You could just postulate some kind of mechanism if you were just trying to explain the behavior.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.120
 So someone like Daniel Dennett is very consistent on this.

06:44.000 --> 06:53.840
 So I think for most people, what science is in the business of is explaining the data of public

06:53.840 --> 06:55.200
 observation experiment.

06:55.200 --> 07:00.720
 If you religiously followed that, you would not postulate consciousness,

07:00.720 --> 07:04.240
 because it's not a datum that's known about in that way.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.320
 And Daniel Dennett is really consistent on this.

07:06.320 --> 07:12.480
 He thinks my consciousness cannot be empirically verified, and therefore it doesn't exist.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.720
 Dennett is consistent on this.

07:14.720 --> 07:19.520
 I think I'm consistent on this, but I think a lot of people have a slightly confused

07:21.200 --> 07:22.800
 middle way position on this.

07:22.800 --> 07:30.400
 On the one hand, they think the business of science is just to account for public

07:30.400 --> 07:37.360
 observation experiment, but on the other hand, they also believe in consciousness without

07:37.360 --> 07:44.160
 appreciating, I think, that that implies that there is another datum over and above the data

07:44.160 --> 07:48.960
 of public observation experiments, namely just the reality of feelings and experiences.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.880
 As we walk along this conversation, you keep opening doors that I don't want to walk into,

07:52.880 --> 07:56.400
 and I will, but I want to try to stay kind of focused.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.480
 So you mentioned Daniel Dennett, let's lay it out, since he sticks to his story,

08:01.760 --> 08:05.440
 pun unintended, and then you stick to yours.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.560
 What is your story?

08:06.560 --> 08:09.200
 What is your theory of consciousness versus his?

08:09.200 --> 08:10.880
 Can you clarify his position?

08:12.880 --> 08:17.920
 So my view, I defend the view known as panpsychism, which is the view that

08:19.120 --> 08:23.680
 consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the physical world.

08:23.680 --> 08:29.520
 So it doesn't literally mean that everything is conscious, despite the meaning of the word,

08:29.520 --> 08:34.880
 pan, everything, psyche, mind, so literally, that means everything has mind.

08:34.880 --> 08:42.160
 But the typical commitment of the panpsychist is that the fundamental building blocks of reality,

08:43.120 --> 08:50.240
 maybe fundamental particles like electrons and quarks, have incredibly simple forms of

08:50.240 --> 08:59.280
 experience, and that the very complex experience of the human or animal brain is somehow rooted

08:59.280 --> 09:04.560
 in or derived from this much more simple consciousness at the level of fundamental physics.

09:05.680 --> 09:13.600
 So I mean, that's a theory that I would justify on the grounds that it can account for this

09:14.240 --> 09:19.040
 datum of consciousness that we are immediately aware of in our experience,

09:19.040 --> 09:21.040
 in a way that I don't think other theories can.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.040
 If you asked me to contrast that to Daniel Dennett, I think he would just say there is no such datum.

09:25.040 --> 09:31.040
 Dennett says the data for science of consciousness is what he calls heterophenomenology,

09:31.040 --> 09:37.040
 which is specifically defined as what we can access from the third person perspective,

09:37.040 --> 09:42.160
 including what people say, but crucially, we're not treating what they say.

09:42.160 --> 09:48.320
 We're not relying on their testimony as evidence for some unobservable

09:48.320 --> 09:55.280
 realm of feelings and experiences. We're just treating what they say as a datum of public

09:55.280 --> 10:00.240
 observation experiments that we can account for in terms of underlying mechanisms.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.440
 But I feel like there's a deeper view of what consciousness is.

10:03.440 --> 10:07.600
 So you have a very clear, and we'll talk quite a bit about panpsychism.

10:07.600 --> 10:13.440
 We have a clear view of what, almost like a physics view of consciousness.

10:13.440 --> 10:20.400
 He, I think, has a kind of view that consciousness is almost the side effect

10:21.280 --> 10:27.120
 of this massively parallel computation system going on in our brain.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.240
 The brain has a model of the world, and it's taking in perceptions,

10:34.240 --> 10:40.000
 and it's constantly weaving multiple stories about that world that's integrating the new

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
 perceptions and the multiple stories, or somehow it's like a Google Doc collaborative editing.

10:46.000 --> 10:54.000
 And that collaborative editing is the actual experience of what we think of as consciousness.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.680
 Somehow the editing is consciousness of this story.

10:59.680 --> 11:02.560
 I mean, that's a theory of consciousness, isn't it?

11:02.560 --> 11:10.160
 And the narrative theory of consciousness, or the multiple versions editing, collaborative editing

11:10.160 --> 11:12.000
 of a narrative theory of consciousness.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.560
 Yeah, he calls it the multiple drafts model.

11:14.560 --> 11:18.880
 Incidentally, there's a very interesting paper just come out by very good philosopher,

11:18.880 --> 11:24.880
 Luke Rolofs, defending a panpsychist version of Dennett's multiple drafts model.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.720
 Like a deeper turtle that that Rolofs stack on top of.

11:28.720 --> 11:33.600
 Just the difference being that this is Luke Rolofs view, all of the drafts are conscious.

11:33.600 --> 11:42.000
 So I guess for Dennett, there's sort of no fact of the matter about which of these drafts

11:42.000 --> 11:47.680
 is the correct one. On Rolofs view, maybe there's no fact of the matter about which

11:47.680 --> 11:54.080
 of these drafts is my consciousness, but nonetheless, all the drafts correspond to some

11:54.080 --> 11:59.040
 consciousness. And I mean, it just sounds kind of funny. I guess I think he calls it Dennettian

11:59.040 --> 12:06.480
 panpsychism. But Luke is one of the most rigorous and serious philosophers alive at the moment,

12:06.480 --> 12:10.800
 I think. And I hate having Luke Rolofs in an audience if I'm giving a talk, because he always

12:10.800 --> 12:15.040
 cuts straight to the weakness in your position that you hadn't thought of.

12:15.040 --> 12:21.360
 And so it's nice, panpsychism is sometimes associated with fluffy thinking, but contemporary

12:21.360 --> 12:26.160
 panpsychists have come out of this tradition we call analytic philosophy, which is rooted in

12:27.440 --> 12:32.800
 detailed, rigorous argumentation, and it is defended in that manner.

12:34.080 --> 12:39.760
 Yeah, those analytic philosophers are sticklers for terminology. It's very fun, very fun group to

12:39.760 --> 12:45.040
 talk shit with. Yeah, well, I mean, it gets boring if you just start and then defining words,

12:45.040 --> 12:49.200
 right? Yeah. I think starting with defining words is good. Actually, the philosopher Derek

12:49.200 --> 12:55.200
 Parfit said when he first was thinking about philosophy, he went to a talk in analytic

12:55.200 --> 13:00.480
 philosophy, and he went to a talk in continental philosophy. And he decided that the problem

13:00.480 --> 13:04.560
 with the continental philosophy, if it was really on rigorous, really imprecise, the problem with

13:04.560 --> 13:10.800
 the analytic philosophy is it was just not about anything important. And he thought there was more

13:10.800 --> 13:16.240
 chance of working within analytic philosophy and asking some more meaningful, some more profound

13:16.240 --> 13:20.560
 questions than there was in working continental philosophy and making it more rigorous. Now,

13:20.560 --> 13:25.920
 they're both horrific stereotypes, and I don't want to get nasty emails from either of these groups,

13:25.920 --> 13:32.640
 but there's something to what he was saying. I think just a tiny tangent on terminology. I do

13:32.640 --> 13:39.200
 think that there's a lot of deep insight to be discovered by just asking questions, what do we

13:39.200 --> 13:45.040
 mean by this word? I remember I was taking a course on algorithms and data structures in computer

13:45.040 --> 13:51.200
 science. And the instructor, shout out to him, Ali Shekafande, amazing professor. And remember,

13:51.200 --> 13:57.520
 he asked some basic questions like, what is an algorithm? The pressure of pushing students to

13:57.520 --> 14:03.520
 answer to think deeply. You just woke up, hungover in college or whatever, and you're tasked with

14:03.520 --> 14:07.360
 answering some deep philosophical question about what is an algorithm. These basic questions,

14:08.080 --> 14:13.680
 and they sound very simple, but they're actually very difficult. And one of the things I really

14:13.680 --> 14:19.520
 value in conversation is asking these dumb, simple questions of like, what is intelligence?

14:20.720 --> 14:28.320
 And just continually asking that question over and over of some of the biggest researchers in

14:28.320 --> 14:32.880
 the artificial intelligence computer science space. It's actually very useful. At the same time,

14:34.160 --> 14:41.120
 it should start a terminology and then progress where you say, ah, fuck it. We'll just assume

14:41.120 --> 14:45.600
 we know what we mean by that. Otherwise, you get the Bill Clinton situation where it's like,

14:47.040 --> 14:52.240
 what is the meaning of is, is whatever he said. It's like, hey, man, did you do the sex stuff or

14:52.240 --> 15:00.640
 not? Yeah. So there's, you have to both be able to talk about the sex stuff and the meaning of the

15:00.640 --> 15:07.200
 word is with consciousness, because we don't currently understand, you know, very much

15:07.200 --> 15:13.280
 terminology discussions are very important. Because it's like, you're almost trying to sneak

15:15.360 --> 15:22.080
 up to some deep insight by just discussing some basic terminology, you know, like what is consciousness

15:22.080 --> 15:29.680
 or even defining the different aspects of panpsychism is fascinating. But just to linger on the

15:29.680 --> 15:40.080
 um, the Daniel Dennett thing. What do you think about narrative, sort of the mind constructing

15:40.080 --> 15:47.520
 narratives for ourselves? So there's nothing special about consciousness deeply. It is some

15:47.520 --> 15:55.840
 property of the human mind that's just is able to tell these pretty stories that we experience

15:55.840 --> 16:01.520
 as consciousness and that it's unique, perhaps to the human mind, which is, I suppose, what Daniel

16:01.520 --> 16:08.320
 Dennett would argue that it's either deeply unique or mostly unique to the human mind.

16:08.880 --> 16:13.760
 It's just on the question of terminology before, right? Yeah. So I think it used to be

16:14.880 --> 16:20.640
 the fashion among philosophers that we had to come up with utterly precise necessary and

16:20.640 --> 16:26.720
 sufficient conditions for each word. And then I think, I think this has gone out of fashion a bit

16:26.720 --> 16:32.320
 partly because it's just been, you know, such a failure. The word knowledge in particular,

16:32.320 --> 16:38.320
 people used to define knowledge as true justified belief. And then this guy, Gettier, had this very

16:38.320 --> 16:43.040
 short paper where he just produced some pretty conclusive counter examples to that. I think,

16:43.040 --> 16:47.520
 you know, he wrote very few papers, but this is just, you know, you have to teach this on a,

16:47.520 --> 16:52.880
 on an undergraduate philosophy course. And then after that, you had a huge literature of people

16:52.880 --> 16:57.360
 trying to address this and propose a new definition, but then someone else would come out with

16:57.360 --> 17:01.120
 counter examples, and then they get a new definition of knowledge and counter examples,

17:01.120 --> 17:04.560
 and it just went on and on and never seemed to get anywhere. So I think the thought now is,

17:05.600 --> 17:10.560
 let's work out how precise we need to be for what we're trying to do. And I think that's a

17:10.560 --> 17:15.200
 healthier attitude. So precision is important, but you just need to work out how precise do we need

17:15.200 --> 17:20.960
 to be for these purposes. Coming to Dennett and narrative theories. I mean, I think,

17:22.960 --> 17:29.440
 I think narrative theories are a plausible contender for a theory of the self,

17:31.200 --> 17:38.960
 theory of my identity over time. What makes me the same person in some sense today as I was

17:38.960 --> 17:45.280
 20 years ago weren't given that I've changed so much physically and psychologically. One running

17:45.280 --> 17:52.080
 contender is something connected to the kind of stories we tell about ourselves, or maybe

17:52.080 --> 17:57.600
 some story about the psychological, the chains of psychological continuity. I'm not saying I accept

17:57.600 --> 18:04.000
 such a theory, but it's plausible. I don't think these theories are good as theories of consciousness,

18:04.000 --> 18:12.000
 at least if we're taking consciousness just to be subjective experience, pleasure, pain,

18:12.000 --> 18:20.160
 seeing, color, hearing, sound. I think a hamster has consciousness in that sense. There's something

18:20.160 --> 18:26.320
 that it's like to be a hamster. It feels pain if you stand on it, if you're cruel enough to do it.

18:26.320 --> 18:31.120
 I don't know why I gave that. People always give, I don't know, philosophers give these very violent

18:31.120 --> 18:35.520
 examples to get the cross consciousness. I don't know why that's coming about, but anyway.

18:35.520 --> 18:44.000
 You say mean things to the hamster. It experiences pain, it experiences pleasure, joy.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.920
 But there's some limits to that experience of a hamster, but there is nevertheless the

18:49.920 --> 18:53.920
 presence of a subjective experience. Yeah. Consciousness is just something,

18:53.920 --> 18:58.960
 because it's a very ambiguous word, but if we're just using it to mean some kind of experience,

18:58.960 --> 19:03.840
 some kind of inner life, that is pretty widespread in the animal kingdom.

19:03.840 --> 19:09.440
 Bit difficult to say where it stops, where it starts, but you certainly don't need

19:09.440 --> 19:14.560
 something as sophisticated as the capacity to self consciously tell stories about yourself to be,

19:15.200 --> 19:23.200
 to just have experience. Except for cats who are evil automatons that are void of consciousness.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.440
 They're the fingertips of the devil. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I was taking that as

19:27.440 --> 19:33.440
 red. I mean, Descartes thought animals were mechanisms. And humans are unique. So the animals

19:33.440 --> 19:39.600
 are robots essentially in the formulation of Descartes and humans are unique. So in which

19:39.600 --> 19:50.080
 way would you say humans are unique versus even our closest ancestors? Is there something special

19:50.080 --> 19:56.880
 about humans? What is in your view under the panpsychism, I guess we're walking backwards,

19:56.880 --> 20:02.800
 because we'll have the big picture conversation about what is panpsychism. But given your kind

20:02.800 --> 20:07.120
 of broad theory of consciousness, what's unique about humans, do you think?

20:07.120 --> 20:14.800
 As a panpsychist, there is a great continuity between humans and the rest of the universe.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.680
 There's nothing that special about human consciousness. It's just a highly evolved form

20:21.680 --> 20:27.760
 of what exists throughout the universe. So we're very much continuous with the rest of

20:27.760 --> 20:33.840
 the physical universe. What is unique about human beings? I suppose the capacity to

20:34.640 --> 20:43.920
 reflect on our conscious experience, plan for the future. The capacity, I would say, to respond to

20:43.920 --> 20:52.320
 reasons as well. Animals in some sense have motivations, but when a human being makes a

20:52.320 --> 20:59.600
 decision, they're responding to what philosophers call normative considerations. If you're saying,

20:59.600 --> 21:04.720
 should I take this job in the US? You weigh it up, you say, well, I'll get more money,

21:04.720 --> 21:09.360
 I'll have maybe a better quality of life, but if I stay in the UK, I'll be closer to family,

21:09.360 --> 21:20.080
 and you weigh up these considerations. I'm not sure any nonhuman animals quite respond

21:20.080 --> 21:23.920
 to considerations of value in that way. I might be reflecting here that I'm something of an

21:23.920 --> 21:31.840
 objectivist about value. I think there are objective facts about what we have reason to do

21:31.840 --> 21:34.480
 and what we have reason to believe. And humans have access to those facts.

21:34.480 --> 21:40.080
 And humans have access to them and can respond to them. That's a controversial claim. Many of my

21:40.080 --> 21:46.720
 puns like his brethren might not... They would say the hamster too can look up to the stars and

21:46.720 --> 21:52.720
 ponder theoretical physics. Maybe not, but I think it depends what you think about value. If you have

21:52.720 --> 22:00.160
 a more humane picture of value, by which I mean relating to the philosopher David Hume, who said

22:00.160 --> 22:07.200
 that reason is the slave of the passions. Really, we just have motivations, and what we have reason

22:07.200 --> 22:13.440
 to do arises from our motivations. I'm not a Hume, and I think there are objective facts about what

22:13.440 --> 22:19.040
 we have reason to do. And I think we have access to them. I don't think any nonhuman animal

22:20.160 --> 22:25.040
 has access to objective facts about what they have reason to do, what they have reason to

22:25.040 --> 22:30.960
 believe. They don't weigh up evidence. The reason is a slave of the passions.

22:30.960 --> 22:36.640
 That was David Hume's view. Yeah. Do you want to know my problem with Hume's? I had a radical

22:36.640 --> 22:42.320
 conversion. This might not be connected to puns like him, but I had a radical conversion. I used

22:42.320 --> 22:50.160
 to have a more humane view when I was a graduate student, but I was persuaded by some professors

22:50.160 --> 22:54.640
 at the University of Reading where I was, that if you have the humane view, you have to say,

22:56.080 --> 23:06.160
 any basic life goals are equal, equally valid. For example, let's take someone whose basic goal

23:06.160 --> 23:13.760
 in life is counting blades of grass. Crucially, they don't enjoy it. This is the crucial part.

23:13.760 --> 23:19.440
 They get no pleasure from it. That's just their basic goal, to spend their life counting as many

23:19.440 --> 23:23.920
 blades of grass as possible, not for some greater goal. That's just their basic goal.

23:25.920 --> 23:31.840
 I want to say that that is objectively stupid. That is objectively pointless. I shouldn't say

23:31.840 --> 23:39.440
 stupid, but it's objectively pointless in a way that pursuing pleasure or pursuing someone else's

23:39.440 --> 23:44.720
 pleasure or pursuing scientific inquiry is not pointless. As soon as you make that admission,

23:44.720 --> 23:51.200
 you're not a follower of David Hume anymore. You think there are objective facts about what

23:51.200 --> 24:00.400
 goals are worth pursuing. Is it possible to have a goal without pleasure? This idea that you disjointed

24:00.400 --> 24:08.560
 the two. David Foster Wallace's idea of the key to life is to be unboreable. Isn't it possible to

24:08.560 --> 24:16.800
 discover the pleasure in everything in life? The counting of the blades of grass. Once you see the

24:16.800 --> 24:23.440
 mastery, the skill of it, you can discover the pleasure. Therefore, I guess what I'm asking is

24:24.080 --> 24:29.760
 why and when and how did you lose the romance in grad school of life? Is that what you're trying to

24:29.760 --> 24:36.640
 say? Well, I think it may or may not be true that it's possible to find pleasure in everything,

24:36.640 --> 24:43.040
 but I think it's also true that people don't act solely for pleasure and they certainly

24:43.040 --> 24:48.960
 don't act solely for their own pleasure. People will suffer for things they think are worthwhile.

24:50.080 --> 25:00.480
 I might suffer for some scientific cause for finding out a cure for the pandemic. In terms

25:00.480 --> 25:05.600
 of my own pleasure, I might have less pleasure in doing that, but I think it's worthwhile. It's

25:05.600 --> 25:13.280
 a worthwhile thing to do. I just don't think it's the case that everything we do is rooted in

25:13.280 --> 25:16.880
 maximizing our own pleasure. I don't think that's even psychologically plausible.

25:16.880 --> 25:20.880
 But pleasure, then that's a narrow view of pleasure. That's like a short term pleasure,

25:20.880 --> 25:28.240
 but you can see pleasure as a kind of ability to hear the music in the distance. It's like,

25:28.240 --> 25:36.560
 yes, it's difficult now. It's suffering now, but there's some greater thing beyond the mountain

25:37.200 --> 25:40.880
 that will be joy. I mean, that's kind of a, even if it's not in this life,

25:42.400 --> 25:48.640
 well, you know, the warriors will meet in Valhalla, right? The feeling that gives meaning and

25:48.640 --> 25:55.040
 fulfillment to life is not necessarily grounded in pleasure of like the counting of the grass.

25:55.040 --> 26:02.320
 It's something else. I don't know. The struggle is a source of deep fulfillment.

26:02.320 --> 26:08.880
 So like, I think pleasure needs to be kind of thought of as a little bit more broadly. It just

26:08.880 --> 26:18.240
 kind of gives you this sense. It, for a moment, allows you to forget the terror of the fact that

26:18.240 --> 26:26.400
 you're going to die. That's pleasure. Like that's the broader view of pleasure that you get to kind

26:26.400 --> 26:34.480
 of play in the little illusion that all of this has deep meaning. That's pleasure.

26:34.480 --> 26:43.440
 Yeah. Well, but I mean, you know, people sacrifice their lives. Atheists may sacrifice their lives

26:43.440 --> 26:49.040
 for the sake of someone else or for the sake of something important enough. And clearly in that

26:49.040 --> 26:54.640
 case, they're not doing it for the sake of their own pleasure. That's a rather dramatic example,

26:54.640 --> 27:03.280
 but they can be just trivial examples where, you know, I choose to be honest rather than lie about

27:03.280 --> 27:09.200
 something. Can I lose out a bit? And I have a bit less pleasure, but I thought it was worth doing

27:09.200 --> 27:13.360
 the honest thing or something. I mean, I just think, so that's a, I mean, maybe you can use the word

27:13.360 --> 27:19.440
 pleasure so broadly that you're just essentially meaning something worthwhile. But then I think

27:19.440 --> 27:25.280
 the word pleasure maybe loses its meaning. Sure. Wow. But what do you think about the blades of

27:25.280 --> 27:28.800
 grass case? What do you think about someone who spends their life counting blades of grass and

27:28.800 --> 27:35.040
 doesn't enjoy it? So I think, I personally think it's impossible, or maybe I'm not understanding

27:35.040 --> 27:40.480
 even like the philosophical formulation, but I think it's impossible to have a goal and not

27:40.480 --> 27:47.600
 draw pleasure from it. Make it worthwhile. Forget the word pleasure. I think the word goal loses

27:47.600 --> 27:53.520
 meaning. If I say I'm going to count the number of pens on this table, if I'm actively involved in

27:53.520 --> 28:01.520
 the task, I will find joy in it. I will find the like, I think there's a lot of meaning and joy

28:01.520 --> 28:11.920
 to be discovered in the skill of a task, in mastering of a skill, and taking pride in doing

28:11.920 --> 28:19.360
 it well. I mean, that's, I don't know what it is about the human mind, but there's some joy to

28:19.360 --> 28:24.800
 be discovered in the mastery of a skill. So I think it's just impossible to count blades of grass

28:24.800 --> 28:31.760
 and not sort of have the Girodreams of Sushi compelling, like draws you into the mastery of the simple task.

28:34.960 --> 28:42.480
 Yeah, I suppose, I mean, in a way, you might think it's just hard to imagine someone who would

28:43.600 --> 28:49.680
 spend their lives doing that, but then maybe that's just because it's so evident that that is

28:49.680 --> 28:55.840
 a pointless task. Whereas, if we take this David Hume view seriously, it ought to be,

28:55.840 --> 29:02.320
 you know, a totally possible life goal. Whereas, I mean, I, yeah, I guess I just find it hard

29:02.320 --> 29:10.960
 to shake the idea that some ways of, some life goals are more worthwhile than others. And it

29:10.960 --> 29:16.400
 doesn't mean, you know, that there's a one single way you should lead your life, but pursuing knowledge,

29:16.400 --> 29:23.920
 helping people, pursuing your own pleasure, to an extent, are worthwhile things to do in the,

29:23.920 --> 29:29.600
 in a way that, you know, for example, I have, I'm a little bit OCD, I still feel inclined to

29:30.400 --> 29:35.600
 walk on cracks in the pavement or do it symmetrically, like if I step on a crack with my left foot,

29:35.600 --> 29:41.280
 I feel the need to do it my right foot. And I think that's kind of pointless. It's something I

29:41.280 --> 29:46.560
 feel the urge to do, but it's pointless. Whereas, other things I choose to do, I think there's,

29:47.360 --> 29:53.600
 it's worth doing. And it's hard to make sense of metaphysically, what could possibly ground that?

29:53.600 --> 29:58.240
 How could we know about these facts? But that's the starting point for me.

29:58.240 --> 30:03.680
 I don't know. I think you walking on the sidewalk in a way that's symmetrical

30:04.800 --> 30:10.880
 brings order to the world. Like if you weren't doing that, the world might fall apart.

30:10.880 --> 30:17.680
 And you, it feels like that. I think there's, there's, there's meaning in that, like you

30:18.720 --> 30:25.440
 embracing the full, like the full experience of that, you living the richness of that,

30:25.440 --> 30:30.800
 as if it has meaning, will give meaning to it. And then whatever genius comes of that,

30:30.800 --> 30:35.680
 as you as a one little intelligent ant, will make a better life for everybody else.

30:35.680 --> 30:40.800
 Perhaps I'm defending the blades of grass example, because I can literally imagine myself enjoying

30:40.800 --> 30:45.040
 this task as somebody who's OCD in a certain kind of way, in quantitative.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.680
 But now you're ruining these, because you imagine someone enjoying it. I'm imagining

30:47.680 --> 30:54.000
 someone who doesn't enjoy it. We don't want a life that's just full of pleasure. Like we just

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
 sit there, you know, having a big sugar high all the time. We want a life where we do things that

31:00.000 --> 31:07.520
 are worthwhile. If for something to be worthwhile just is for it to be a basic life goal, then

31:07.520 --> 31:14.000
 um, that, that mode of reflection doesn't really make sense. We can't really think,

31:14.000 --> 31:17.680
 did I do things worthwhile on the, on the David Hume type picture?

31:18.960 --> 31:23.440
 All it is for something to be worthwhile is it was a basic goal of yours or derived from a basic

31:23.440 --> 31:30.960
 goal. And yeah, yeah, I mean, I think goal and worthwhile aren't, I think goals are boring word.

31:30.960 --> 31:36.160
 I'm more sort of existentialist like, did you ride the roller coaster of life? Did you fully

31:36.160 --> 31:43.920
 experience life that, and in that sense, I mean, the blaze of grass is something that could be

31:43.920 --> 31:49.280
 deeply joyful. And that's, in that way, I think suffering could be joyful in the full context

31:49.280 --> 31:53.840
 of life. It's the roller coaster of life. Like without suffering, without struggle, without

31:53.840 --> 31:59.360
 pain, without depression or sadness, there's not the highs. I mean, that's the, that's the

31:59.360 --> 32:10.480
 fucked up thing about life is that the lows really make the highs that much richer and deeper and,

32:11.200 --> 32:14.160
 and like taste better. Right? Like the,

32:17.040 --> 32:22.560
 like I was, I tweeted this, I was, I couldn't sleep and I was like late at night. And I know it's

32:22.560 --> 32:35.360
 like obvious statement, but like every love story eventually, you know, ends in loss in tragedy.

32:36.080 --> 32:44.880
 So like this feeling of love, at the end, there's always going to be tragedy, even if it's

32:44.880 --> 32:53.120
 the most amazing lifelong love with another human being, one of you is going to die. And I don't

32:53.120 --> 33:01.600
 know which is worse, but both, both are not going to be pretty. And so that the sense that it's finite,

33:01.600 --> 33:09.360
 the sense that it's going to end in a low, that gives like richness to those kind of evenings

33:09.360 --> 33:15.120
 when you realize this fucking thing ends, this thing ends, the feeling that it ends,

33:17.680 --> 33:23.920
 that bad taste, that bad feeling that it ends gives meaning, gives joy, gives, I don't know,

33:23.920 --> 33:31.040
 pleasure is this loaded word, but gives some kind of a deep pleasure to the experience when it's

33:31.040 --> 33:40.560
 good. And I mean, and that's the blades of grass, you know, they have that to me. But you're

33:40.560 --> 33:49.520
 perhaps right that it's like reducing it to set of goals or something like that is kind of removing

33:49.520 --> 33:56.640
 the magic of life. Because I think what makes counting the blades of grass joyful is it's just

33:56.640 --> 34:03.520
 because it's life. Okay, so it sounds like you, it sounds like you reject the David Hume type

34:03.520 --> 34:08.480
 picture anyway, because you're saying just because you have it as a goal, that's what it is to be

34:08.480 --> 34:12.400
 worthwhile, but you're saying no, it's because it's engaging the life, riding the roller coaster.

34:14.000 --> 34:20.400
 So that does sound like in some sense, there are facts independent of our personal goal choices

34:20.400 --> 34:25.760
 about what it means to live a good life. And I mean, coming back full circle to the start of

34:25.760 --> 34:30.400
 this was what makes us different to animals. I don't think at the end of a hamster's life, it's

34:30.400 --> 34:35.600
 it thinks, did I ride the roller coaster? Did I really live life to the full? That is not a mode

34:35.600 --> 34:42.400
 of reflection that's available to non human animals. So what do you think is the role of death

34:43.600 --> 34:51.760
 in all of this, the fear of death? Does that interplay with consciousness? Does this self

34:51.760 --> 35:00.080
 reflection? Do you think there's some deep connection between this ability to contemplate

35:00.080 --> 35:06.640
 the fact that the our flame of consciousness eventually goes out?

35:08.320 --> 35:15.040
 Yeah, I don't think unfortunately, panpsychism helps particularly with life after death, because

35:15.040 --> 35:22.800
 you know, for the panpsychist, there's nothing supernatural, there's nothing beyond the physical,

35:22.800 --> 35:27.840
 all there is really is ultimately particles and fields. It's just that we think the ultimate

35:27.840 --> 35:38.160
 nature of particles and fields is consciousness. But I guess when when the the matter in my brain

35:38.160 --> 35:45.920
 ceases to be ordered in a way that sustains the particular kind of consciousness I enjoy in waking

35:45.920 --> 35:52.880
 life, then in some sense, I will cease to be. Although I do that the final chapter of my book

35:52.880 --> 36:00.080
 Galileo's era is more experimental. So the first four chapters are the cold blooded case for the

36:00.080 --> 36:04.240
 panpsychist view is that the best solution to the heart problem of consciousness.

36:04.240 --> 36:09.360
 The last chapter is we talk about meaning. Yeah, talk about meaning, talk about free will,

36:09.360 --> 36:14.080
 and I talk about mystical experiences. So I always want to emphasize that

36:15.440 --> 36:20.240
 panpsychism is not necessarily connected to anything spiritual. You know, a lot of people

36:20.240 --> 36:27.040
 defending this view, like David Sharma's or Luke Rolof's are just total atheist secularists,

36:27.040 --> 36:31.520
 right? They don't believe in any kind of transcendent reality, they just believe in

36:31.520 --> 36:36.800
 in feelings, you know, mundane consciousness and think that needs explaining in our

36:36.800 --> 36:44.400
 conventional scientific approach can't cut it. But if for independent reasons you are

36:44.400 --> 36:51.120
 motivated to some spiritual picture of reality, then maybe a panpsychist view is more consonant

36:51.120 --> 36:58.960
 with that. So if you if you have a mystical experience where you it seems to you in this

36:58.960 --> 37:04.880
 experience that there is this higher form of consciousness at the root of all things,

37:05.680 --> 37:09.040
 if you're a materialist, you've got to think that's a delusion, you know, there's just

37:09.040 --> 37:13.760
 something in your brain making you think that it's not real. But if you're a panpsychist and

37:13.760 --> 37:19.760
 you already think the fundamental natural reality is constitutive consciousness,

37:19.760 --> 37:27.520
 it's not that much of a leap to think that this higher form of consciousness you seem to apprehend

37:27.520 --> 37:33.120
 in the mystical experience is part of that underlying reality. And, you know, in many

37:33.120 --> 37:41.040
 different cultures, experienced meditators have claimed to have experiences in which it becomes

37:41.040 --> 37:48.000
 apparent to them that there is an element of consciousness that is universal. So this is

37:48.000 --> 37:54.880
 sometimes called universal consciousness. So on this view, your mind and my mind are not

37:54.880 --> 38:01.600
 totally distinct. Each of our individual conscious minds is built upon the foundations of universal

38:01.600 --> 38:07.680
 consciousness and universal consciousness as it exists in me is one and the same thing as universal

38:07.680 --> 38:17.680
 consciousness as it exists in you. So I've never had one of these experiences. But if one is a

38:17.680 --> 38:22.080
 panpsychist, I think one is more open to that possibility. I don't see why it shouldn't be the

38:22.080 --> 38:27.680
 why it shouldn't be the case that that is part of the nature of consciousness and maybe something

38:27.680 --> 38:33.520
 that is apparent in certain deep states of meditation. And so what I explore in the experimental

38:33.520 --> 38:41.040
 final chapter of my book is that could allow for a kind of impersonal life after death,

38:41.040 --> 38:48.560
 because if that view is true, then even when the particular aspects of my conscious experience

38:48.560 --> 38:55.120
 fall away, that element of universal consciousness at the core of my identity would

38:55.120 --> 39:00.800
 continue to exist. So it sort of be as it were absorbed into universal consciousness. So I mean,

39:01.760 --> 39:08.080
 Buddhists and Hindu mystics try to meditate to get rid of all the bad karma to

39:09.440 --> 39:15.200
 be absorbed into universal consciousness. It could be that if there's no karma,

39:15.200 --> 39:19.120
 if there's no reverb, maybe everyone gets enlightened when they die. Maybe you just

39:19.840 --> 39:27.120
 think back into universal consciousness. So I also coming back to morality suggest this could

39:27.120 --> 39:35.760
 provide some kind of basis for altruism or non egotism, because if you think egotism implicitly,

39:36.320 --> 39:44.000
 assumes that we are utterly distinct individuals. Whereas on this view, we're not, we overlap to

39:44.000 --> 39:48.800
 an extent that something at the core of our being is even in this life, we overlap.

39:48.800 --> 39:54.000
 That would be this view that some experienced meditators claim becomes apparent to them,

39:54.000 --> 40:00.000
 that there is something at the core of my identity that is one and the same as

40:00.720 --> 40:04.960
 the thing at the core of your identity, this universal consciousness.

40:05.680 --> 40:12.000
 Yeah, there is something very like you and I in this conversation, there's a few people

40:12.000 --> 40:20.560
 listening to this, all of us are in a kind of single mind together. There's some small aspect of that

40:21.280 --> 40:27.840
 and or maybe a big aspect about us humans. So certainly in a space of ideas, we kind of

40:29.440 --> 40:35.520
 meld together for a time at least in a conversation and kind of play with that idea.

40:35.520 --> 40:40.400
 And then we're clearly all thinking, like if I say pink elephant, there's going to be a few

40:40.400 --> 40:45.280
 people that are now visualizing a pink elephant. We're all thinking about that pink elephant

40:45.280 --> 40:50.800
 together. We're all in the room together thinking about this pink elephant and we're like rotating it

40:53.200 --> 41:00.960
 in our minds together. What is that? Is there a different instantiation of that pink elephant

41:00.960 --> 41:06.240
 in everybody's mind or is it the same elephant? And we have the same mind exploring that elephant.

41:06.240 --> 41:11.520
 Now if we are in our mind, start petting that elephant, like touching it, that experience that

41:11.520 --> 41:17.280
 we're now thinking what that would feel like, is that all of us experiencing that together

41:17.280 --> 41:22.560
 or is that separate? So there's some aspect of the togetherness that almost seems fundamental

41:22.560 --> 41:27.120
 to civilization, to society. Hopefully that's not too strong, but to some of the

41:28.320 --> 41:34.240
 fundamental properties of the human mind. It feels like the social aspect is really important.

41:34.240 --> 41:40.560
 And we call it social because we think of us as individual minds interacting. But if we're just

41:40.560 --> 41:47.120
 like one collective mind with like fingertips, they're like touching each other as it's trying

41:47.120 --> 41:53.040
 to explore the elephant. But that could be just in the realm of ideas and intelligence and not

41:53.040 --> 41:58.080
 in the realm of consciousness. And it's interesting to see maybe it is in the realm of consciousness.

41:58.080 --> 42:04.720
 Yeah, so it's obviously certainly true in some sense that there are these phenomena that you're

42:04.720 --> 42:09.280
 talking about of collective consciousness in some sense. I suppose the question is,

42:10.320 --> 42:14.880
 how ontologically serious do we want to be about those things? By which I mean,

42:16.080 --> 42:20.800
 are they just a construction of out of our minds and the fact that we interact in the

42:20.800 --> 42:27.440
 standard, standardly scientifically accepted ways? Or is as someone like Rupert Sheldrake would

42:27.440 --> 42:33.440
 think that there is some metaphysical reality, there are some fields beyond the scientifically

42:33.440 --> 42:38.400
 understood ones that are somehow communicating this. I mean, I think that, I mean, the view I

42:38.400 --> 42:43.280
 was describing was that this element we're supposed to have in common is some sort of

42:43.920 --> 42:48.720
 pure impersonal consciousness or something rather than. So actually, I mean, an interesting figure

42:48.720 --> 42:55.760
 is the Australian philosopher Miriel Bahari, who defends a kind of mystical, conceptual

42:55.760 --> 43:02.400
 reality rooted in Advaita Vedanta mysticism. But like me, she's from this tradition of

43:02.400 --> 43:07.680
 analytic philosophy. And so she defends this in this incredibly precise, rigorous way.

43:07.680 --> 43:13.760
 She defends the idea that we should think of experienced meditators as providing expert testimony.

43:13.760 --> 43:21.200
 So, you know, I think humans cause a causing climate breakdown. I have no idea of the science

43:21.200 --> 43:26.480
 behind it, you know, but I trust the experts or, you know, that the universe is 14 billion years old.

43:26.480 --> 43:31.600
 You know, most of our knowledge is based on expert testimony. And she thinks we should think of

43:32.560 --> 43:36.720
 experienced meditators, these people who are telling us about this universal consciousness

43:36.720 --> 43:40.960
 at the core of our being as a relevant kind of expert. And so she wants to defend, you know,

43:40.960 --> 43:46.160
 the rational acceptability of this mystical, conceptual reality. So, you know, I think

43:47.520 --> 43:50.960
 we shouldn't be ashamed, you know, we shouldn't be worried about

43:52.080 --> 43:57.760
 dealing with certain views as long as it's done with rigor and seriousness. You know,

43:57.760 --> 44:02.560
 I think sometimes terms like, I don't know, new age or something can function a bit like racist

44:02.560 --> 44:09.040
 terms, you know, a racist term picks out a group of people, but then implies certain negative

44:09.040 --> 44:13.120
 characteristics. So people use this term, you know, to pick out a certain set of views like

44:13.680 --> 44:21.120
 mystical, conceptual reality and imply it's kind of fluffy thinking. But, you know, you read

44:21.120 --> 44:25.760
 Miri Al Bahari, you read Luke Rolof's, this is serious, rigorous thought, whether you agree

44:25.760 --> 44:30.320
 with it or not, obviously, it's usually controversial. And so, you know, the enlightenment ideal

44:31.280 --> 44:37.040
 is to follow the evidence and the arguments where they lead. But it's kind of very hard for human

44:37.040 --> 44:42.960
 beings to do that. I think we get stuck in some conception of how we think science ought to look.

44:44.240 --> 44:50.640
 And, you know, people talk about religion as a crutch, but I think a certain kind of

44:50.640 --> 44:56.960
 scientism, a certain conception of how science is supposed to be gets into people's identity

44:56.960 --> 45:04.480
 and their sense of themselves and their security. And make things hard if you're a pun psychic.

45:04.480 --> 45:11.760
 And even the word expert becomes a kind of crutch. I mean, use the word expert.

45:12.640 --> 45:16.880
 You have some kind of conception of what expertise means. Oftentimes, that's,

45:17.520 --> 45:22.480
 you know, connected with a degree, a particular prestigious university or something like that.

45:22.480 --> 45:30.800
 Or, you know, expertise is a funny one. I've noticed that anybody sort of that claims they're

45:30.800 --> 45:37.200
 an expert is usually not the expert. The biggest quote unquote expert that I've ever met are the

45:37.200 --> 45:43.600
 ones that are truly humble. So, humility is a really good sign of somebody who's traveled the

45:43.600 --> 45:49.280
 long road and been humbled by how little they know. So, some of the best people in the world at

45:49.280 --> 45:52.960
 whatever the thing they've spent their life doing are the ones that are ultimately

45:52.960 --> 46:00.480
 humble in the face of it all. So, like, just being humble for how little we know even if we

46:00.480 --> 46:06.960
 travel a lifetime. I do like the idea. I mean, treating sort of like what is it, psychonauts,

46:07.520 --> 46:14.080
 like an expert witness, you know, people who have traveled with the help of DMT to another place

46:14.080 --> 46:21.040
 where they got some deep understanding of something. And their insight is perhaps as valuable

46:21.040 --> 46:27.360
 as the insight of somebody who ran rigorous psychological studies at Princeton University

46:27.360 --> 46:32.880
 or something. Like, those psychonauts, they have wisdom if it's done rigorously,

46:33.840 --> 46:37.600
 which you can also do rigorously within the university, within the studies now,

46:37.600 --> 46:42.320
 with the, with psilocybin and those kinds of things. Yeah, that's a fact that's fascinating.

46:42.320 --> 46:49.120
 I think still probably the best, one of the best works on mystical experience is the chapter in

46:49.120 --> 46:56.000
 William James's varieties of religious experiences. And most of it is just a psychological study of

46:56.000 --> 47:01.600
 trying to define the characteristics of mystical experience as a psychological type. But at the

47:01.600 --> 47:07.520
 end, he considers the question, if you have a mystical experience, is it rational to trust it,

47:07.520 --> 47:12.080
 to trust that it's telling you something about reality? And he makes an interesting argument.

47:12.080 --> 47:18.240
 He says, if you say no, you're kind of applying a double standard, because we all think it's

47:18.240 --> 47:25.680
 okay to trust our normal sensory experiences. But we have no way of getting outside of ourselves

47:25.680 --> 47:31.520
 to prove that our sensory experiences correspond to an external reality. We could be in the matrix,

47:31.520 --> 47:38.400
 this could be a very vivid dream. You could say, oh, we do science, but a scientist only

47:39.200 --> 47:44.960
 gets their data by experiencing the results of their experiments. And then the question arises

47:44.960 --> 47:49.280
 again, how do you know that corresponds to a real world? So he thinks there's a sort of double

47:49.280 --> 47:55.200
 standard in saying it's okay to trust our ordinary sensory experiences, but it's not okay for the

47:55.200 --> 48:01.120
 person on DMT to trust those experiences. It's very philosophically difficult to say, why is it okay

48:01.120 --> 48:06.880
 in the one case and not the other? So I think there's an interesting argument there. But I would

48:06.880 --> 48:13.520
 like to just defend experts a little bit. I mean, I agree it's very difficult. But especially in an

48:13.520 --> 48:22.400
 age, I guess, where there's so much information, I do think it's important to have some protection of

48:23.760 --> 48:29.440
 sources of information, academic institutions that we can trust. And then that's difficult,

48:29.440 --> 48:34.240
 because of course, there are non academics who do know what they're talking about. But if I'm

48:35.280 --> 48:40.880
 interested in knowing about biology, you can't research everything. So I think we have to have

48:40.880 --> 48:49.200
 to have some sense of who are the experts we can trust, the people who've spent a lot of time reading

48:49.200 --> 48:56.560
 all the material that people have read, written, thinking about it, having their views torn apart

48:56.560 --> 49:01.520
 by other people working in the field. I think that is very important. And also to protect that

49:01.520 --> 49:06.240
 from conflicts of interest, there is a so called think tank in the UK called the Institute of

49:06.240 --> 49:13.440
 Economic Affairs, who are always on the BBC as experts on economic questions, and they do not

49:13.440 --> 49:21.280
 declare who funds them. So we don't know who's paying the piper. I think you shouldn't be allowed

49:21.280 --> 49:26.160
 to call yourself a think tank if you're not totally transparent about who's funding you.

49:27.040 --> 49:30.880
 And I mean, this connects to panpsychism, because I think the reason people

49:30.880 --> 49:37.120
 worry about unorthodox ideas is because they worry about, how do we know when we're just losing

49:37.120 --> 49:44.960
 control or losing discipline? So I do think we need to somehow protect academic institutions as

49:46.480 --> 49:53.440
 sources of information that we can trust. And in philosophy, there's not much consensus on

49:53.440 --> 50:01.440
 everything, but you can at least know what people who have put the time in to read all the stuff,

50:02.240 --> 50:04.560
 what they think about these issues. I think that is important.

50:04.560 --> 50:09.680
 To push back on your pushback, who are the experts on COVID?

50:10.720 --> 50:12.560
 Oh, they're getting into dangerous territory now.

50:12.560 --> 50:17.600
 Well, let me just speak to it, because I am walking through that dangerous territory.

50:17.600 --> 50:31.440
 I'm allergic to the word expert, because in my simple mind, it kind of rhymes with ego.

50:32.640 --> 50:41.280
 There's something about experts. If we allow too much to have a category expert and place

50:41.280 --> 50:48.480
 certain people in them, those people sitting on the throne start to believe it, and they start

50:48.480 --> 50:59.120
 to communicate with that energy, and the humility starts to dissipate. I think there is value in

50:59.120 --> 51:07.680
 a lifelong mastery of a skill and the pursuit of knowledge within a very specific discipline.

51:07.680 --> 51:14.320
 But the moment you have your name on an office, the moment you're an expert, I think you destroy

51:14.320 --> 51:23.920
 the very aspect, the very value of that journey towards knowledge. Some of it probably just reduces

51:23.920 --> 51:31.600
 to skillful communication of communicating the way that shows humility, that shows an open

51:31.600 --> 51:38.240
 mind in this, that shows an ability to really hear what a lot of people are saying. In the case of

51:38.240 --> 51:47.680
 COVID, what I've noticed, and this is probably true with panpsychism as well, is so called experts,

51:48.880 --> 51:52.320
 and they are extremely knowledgeable. Many of them are colleagues of mine.

51:53.040 --> 52:00.720
 They dismiss what millions of people are saying on the internet without having looked into it,

52:00.720 --> 52:07.840
 but with empathy and rigor, honestly, understand what are the arguments being made. They say there's

52:07.840 --> 52:13.360
 not enough time to explore all those things. There's so much stuff out there. Yeah, I think

52:13.360 --> 52:18.800
 that's intellectual laziness. If you don't have enough time, then don't speak so strongly with

52:18.800 --> 52:24.880
 dismissal. Feel bad about it. Be apologetic about the fact that you don't have enough time to explore

52:24.880 --> 52:32.720
 the evidence. For example, the heat I got with Francis Collins is that he kind of said that

52:33.520 --> 52:41.040
 lab leak, he kind of dismissed it, showing that he didn't really deeply explore all the

52:42.960 --> 52:48.240
 huge amount of circumstantial evidence out there, the battles that are going on out there.

52:48.240 --> 52:55.840
 There's a lot of people really intensely discussing this and showing humility in the face

52:55.840 --> 53:00.800
 of that battle of ideas, I think is really important. I've just been very disappointed

53:00.800 --> 53:07.680
 in so called expertise in the space of science, in showing humility, in showing humanity and kindness

53:07.680 --> 53:14.400
 and empathy towards other human beings. At the same time, obviously, I love

53:14.400 --> 53:22.960
 Jiro Junsu Sushi, lifelong pursuit of getting, in computer science, Don Knuth.

53:24.160 --> 53:31.520
 Some of my biggest heroes are people that when nobody else cares, they stay on one topic

53:32.240 --> 53:36.480
 for their whole life and they just find the beautiful little things about their puzzles

53:36.480 --> 53:42.080
 they keep solving. Yes, sometimes a virus happens or something happens with that person,

53:42.080 --> 53:48.560
 and with their puzzles becomes like the center of the whole world because that puzzle becomes

53:48.560 --> 53:53.280
 all of a sudden really important. But still, there's possibilities on them to show humility

53:53.280 --> 53:57.600
 and to be open minded to the fact that they, even if they spent their whole life doing it,

53:57.600 --> 54:04.720
 even if their whole community is giving them awards and giving them citations and giving them

54:04.720 --> 54:08.800
 all kinds of stuff where they're bowing down before them, how smart they are,

54:08.800 --> 54:15.280
 they still know nothing relative to all the stuff, the mysteries that are out there.

54:15.840 --> 54:20.000
 Yeah, I wonder how much we're disagreeing. I mean, these are totally valid issues,

54:20.000 --> 54:26.240
 and of course, expertise goes wrong in all sorts of ways. It's totally fallible. I suppose I would

54:26.240 --> 54:34.400
 just say, what is the alternative? What do we just say? All information is equal because I,

54:34.400 --> 54:41.120
 you know, as a voter, I've got to decide who to vote for, and that, you know, I've got to evaluate,

54:42.400 --> 54:49.840
 and I can't look into all of the economics and all of the relevant science. And so,

54:50.880 --> 54:55.840
 I just think there's, I think in, maybe it's like Churchill said about democracy, you know,

54:55.840 --> 55:00.640
 it's the worst system of government apart from all the rest. I think about panpsychism is actually

55:00.640 --> 55:05.520
 the worst theory of consciousness apart from all the rest. But, you know, I just think expertise,

55:05.520 --> 55:12.080
 the peer review system, I think it's terrible in so many ways. Yes, people should show more

55:12.080 --> 55:18.560
 humility, but I can't see a viable alternative. I think philosopher Bernard Williams had a really

55:18.560 --> 55:25.600
 nice nuanced discussion of the problems of titles, but how they also function in a society,

55:25.600 --> 55:31.040
 they do have some positive function. The very first time I lectured in philosophy,

55:32.800 --> 55:41.520
 before I got a professorship, was teaching at a continuing education college. So,

55:41.520 --> 55:48.880
 it's kind of kind of a retired people who want to learn some more things. And I just totally

55:48.880 --> 55:54.480
 pitched it too high. And Gait talked about Bernard Williams on titles and hierarchies.

55:54.480 --> 56:00.800
 And these kind of people in their 70s and 80s who just instantly started interrupting saying,

56:00.800 --> 56:05.920
 what is philosophy? And it was a disaster. And I just remember in the break,

56:06.560 --> 56:10.240
 a sort of elderly lady came up and said, I've decided to take Egyptology instead.

56:11.600 --> 56:18.560
 But that was my introduction to teaching. Anyway, but sort of titles and accomplishments

56:18.560 --> 56:27.120
 is a nice starting point, but doesn't buy you the whole thing. So, you don't get to just say,

56:27.120 --> 56:32.400
 this is true because I'm an expert. You still have to convince people. One of the things I

56:32.400 --> 56:39.760
 really like to practice martial arts, and for people who don't know, it's Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

56:39.760 --> 56:45.280
 is one of them. And you sometimes wear these pajamas, pajama looking things, and you wear a

56:45.280 --> 56:52.000
 belt. So, I happen to be a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. And I also train in what's called no

56:52.000 --> 56:58.240
 gi, so you don't wear the pajamas. And when you don't wear the pajamas, nobody knows what rank

56:58.240 --> 57:02.800
 you are. Nobody knows if you're a black belt or a white belt or if you're a complete beginner or

57:02.800 --> 57:10.400
 not. And when you wear the pajamas called the gi, you wear the rank. And people treat you

57:10.400 --> 57:17.280
 very differently. When they see my black belt, they treat me differently. They kind of defer to

57:17.280 --> 57:28.480
 my expertise. If they're kicking my ass, that's probably because I am working on something new,

57:28.480 --> 57:34.640
 or maybe I'm letting them win. But when there's no belts, and it doesn't matter if I've been doing

57:34.640 --> 57:41.200
 this for 15 years, it doesn't matter. None of it matters. What matters is the raw interaction of

57:41.200 --> 57:48.000
 just trying to kick each other's ass and seeing like, what is this chess game, like a human chess

57:49.360 --> 57:54.720
 who, what are the ideas that we're playing with? And I think there's a dance there. Yes,

57:54.720 --> 58:00.800
 it's valuable to know a person is a black belt. When you take consideration of the advice of

58:00.800 --> 58:05.440
 different people, me versus somebody who's only practiced for like a couple of days. But at the

58:05.440 --> 58:13.440
 same time, the raw practice of ideas that is combat and the raw practice of exchange of ideas

58:13.440 --> 58:20.960
 that is science needs to often throw away expertise. And in communicating, like there's

58:20.960 --> 58:27.280
 a other thing to science and expertise, which is leadership. It's not just, so the scientific

58:27.280 --> 58:34.000
 method in the review process is this rigorous battle of ideas between scientists. But there's

58:34.000 --> 58:40.480
 also a stepping up and inspiring the world and communicating ideas to the world. And that skill

58:40.480 --> 58:48.080
 of communication, I suppose that's my biggest criticism of so called experts in science.

58:48.080 --> 58:53.680
 Is there just shitty communicators? Absolutely. Yeah. Well, I can tell you, I get very frustrated

58:53.680 --> 59:02.000
 with philosophers not reaching out more. I think it might be partly that we're trained to get water

59:02.000 --> 59:09.040
 tight arguments, respond to all objections. And as you do that, eventually it gets more complicated

59:09.040 --> 59:17.840
 and the jargon comes in. So to write a more accessible book or article, you have to loosen

59:17.840 --> 59:21.280
 the arguments a bit. And then we worry that other philosophers will think, oh, that's a

59:21.280 --> 59:25.920
 really crap argument. So I mean, the way I did it, I wrote my academic book first, which is

59:25.920 --> 59:31.600
 just a fundamental reality. And then a more accessible book, Galileo's Era, where the arguments,

59:31.600 --> 59:35.920
 you know, not as rigorously worked out. So then I can say the proper arguments there,

59:35.920 --> 59:42.800
 you know, the further arguments there. That's really done, by the way. So for people who don't

59:42.800 --> 59:48.320
 know, you first wrote consciousness and fundamental reality. So that's the academic book also very

59:48.320 --> 59:54.560
 good. I had flew through it last night, bought it. And then obviously, the popular book is Galileo's

59:54.560 --> 59:59.440
 Era, Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness. That's kind of the right way to do it.

1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:04.320
 To show that you're legit to your community, to the world by doing the book that nobody's going

1:00:04.320 --> 1:00:11.440
 to read. And then doing a popular book that everybody's going to read. That's cool.

1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:18.080
 Well, I try now, every time I write an academic article, I try to write a more accessible version.

1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:22.400
 I mean, the thing I've been working on recently, just because there's this argument.

1:00:24.080 --> 1:00:31.520
 So there's a certain argument from the cosmological fine tuning of the laws of physics for life

1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:41.680
 to the multiverse that's quite popular physicists like Max Tegmark. There's an argument in philosophy

1:00:41.680 --> 1:00:48.720
 journals that there's a fallacious line of reasoning going on there from the fine tuning

1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:54.640
 to the multiverse. Now, that argument is from 20, 30 years ago. And it's, you know, disgusting

1:00:54.640 --> 1:01:00.400
 academic philosophy. Nobody knows about it. And there is huge interest in this fine tuning stuff.

1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:05.520
 Scientists wanting to argue for the multiverse. Theists wanting to say this is evidence for God.

1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:10.560
 And nobody knows about this argument, which tries to show that it's fallacious reasoning

1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:15.760
 to go from the fine tuning to the multiverse. So I wrote a piece for Scientific American explaining

1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:21.840
 this argument to a more general audience. And, you know, that's, it just, it just really irritates

1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:29.440
 me that it's just buried in these technical journal articles and nobody knows about it.

1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:35.120
 But just, you know, final thing on, you know, like, I don't disagree with anything you said.

1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:39.760
 And that's kind of really beautiful, that martial arts example and thinking how that could be

1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:46.960
 analogous. But I think it's very rare to find a good philosopher who hasn't had,

1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:54.240
 who hasn't given a talk to other philosophers and had objections raised. I was going to say,

1:01:54.240 --> 1:02:00.160
 have it torn apart, but that's maybe thinking of it in a slightly the wrong way, but have the best

1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:08.880
 objections raised to it, you know, and that's why that is an important formative process

1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:16.000
 that you go through as an academic, that the greatest minds starting a philosophy degree,

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:24.320
 for example, won't have gone through. And probably, except in very rare cases, just won't have that,

1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:30.640
 that the skills required. But part of it is just fun to disagree and dance with. I think

1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:37.520
 to elaborate on what you're saying in agreement, not just gone through that, but continue to go

1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:43.280
 through that. That's, I would say, the biggest problem with quote unquote expertise is that

1:02:43.280 --> 1:02:49.520
 there's a certain point where you get, because it sucks, like is martial arts is a good example

1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:55.840
 that it sucks to get your ass kicked. Like I, there's a temptation, I still go, like I train,

1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:01.520
 you know, you get an older too, but also there's killers out there in both the space of

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:07.680
 martial arts and the space of science. And I think that once you become a professor, like more and

1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:12.960
 more senior and more and more respected, I don't know if you get your ass kicked in the space of

1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:19.120
 ideas as often. I don't know if you allow yourself to truly expose yourself. If you do,

1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:28.400
 that's a great, like sign of a humble, brilliant mind is constantly exposing yourself to that.

1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:34.000
 I think you do because I think there's graduate students who want to, you know, find the objection

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:42.000
 to sort of write their paper or make their mark. And yeah, I think everyone still gives talks or

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:48.320
 should give talk, give talks and people are wanting to work out if there are any weaknesses to your

1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:58.000
 position. So yeah, I think that generally works out. There is also kind of who do you give the

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:07.040
 talks to. So I mean, within communities, the little cluster of people that argue and bicker,

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:14.320
 but what are they arguing about? They take a bunch of stuff, a bunch of basic assumptions

1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:21.040
 as agreement, and they heatedly argue about certain ideas. The question is how open are,

1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:25.680
 that that's actually kind of like fun. That's like, no offense, sorry, we're sticking on this

1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:30.960
 martial arts thing. It's like people who practice Aikido or certain martial arts that don't truly

1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:38.640
 test themselves in the cage, in combat. So it's like, it's fun to argue about like certain things

1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:45.520
 when you're in your own community, but you don't test those ideas in the full context of science,

1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:53.520
 in the full like seriousness, the rigor of the sometimes like the real world. One of my favorite

1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:59.920
 fields is psychology. There's often places within psychology where you're kind of doing these studies

1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:08.080
 and arguing about stuff that's done in the lab. The arguments are almost disjoint from real human

1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:13.120
 behavior. Because it's so much easier to study human behavior in the lab, you just kind of stay

1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:17.040
 there and that's where the arguments are. And so vision science is a good example like studying

1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:21.440
 eye movement and how we perceive the world and all that kind of stuff. It's so much easier to

1:05:21.440 --> 1:05:27.120
 study in a lab that we don't consider, we say that's going to be what the science of vision is

1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:31.600
 going to be like and we don't consider the science of vision in the actual real world, the engineering

1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:38.160
 of vision, I don't know. And so I think that's where exposing yourself to out of the box ideas.

1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:42.320
 That's the most painful and that's the most important. I mean, group thing can be a terrible

1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:48.560
 thing in philosophy as well, but because you're not to the same extent beholden to evidence

1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:54.400
 and refutation from the evidence that you are in the sciences, it's a more subtle process of

1:05:54.400 --> 1:05:59.760
 evaluation and so more susceptible, I think to group think. I agree, it's a danger.

1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:07.200
 We've talked about a million times, but let's try to sort of do that old basic terminology

1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:15.280
 definitions. What is panpsychism? What are the different ways you can try to think about to

1:06:15.280 --> 1:06:23.920
 define panpsychism, maybe in contrast to naturalistic dualism and materialism and other kinds of views

1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:32.400
 of consciousness? Yeah, so you've basically laid out the different options. So I guess

1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:40.080
 probably still the dominant view is materialism, that roughly that we can explain consciousness in

1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:46.480
 the terms of physical science, wholly explain it just in terms of the electrochemical signaling

1:06:46.480 --> 1:06:55.840
 in the brain. Dualism, the polar opposite view, the consciousness is non physical outside of the

1:06:55.840 --> 1:07:02.320
 physical workings of the body and the brain, although closely connected. And when I studied

1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:06.800
 philosophy, we were taught basically they were the two options you had to choose, right? Either

1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:11.680
 you thought it was dualist and you thought it was separate from the physical or you thought it was

1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:17.360
 just electrochemical signaling and yeah, I became very disillusioned because I think there are big

1:07:17.360 --> 1:07:22.000
 problems with both of these options. So I think the attraction of panpsychism is it's kind of a

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:27.120
 middle way. It agrees with the materialist that there's just the physical world, ultimately

1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:35.200
 there's just particles and fields, but the panpsychist thinks there's more to the physical

1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:41.680
 than what physical science reveals and that the ultimate nature of the physical world

1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:47.520
 is constituted of consciousness. So consciousness is not outside of the physical as the dualist thinks

1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:55.280
 it's embedded in, underlies the kind of description of the world we get from physics.

1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:00.000
 What are the problems of materialism and dualism?

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:09.200
 Starting with materialism, it's a huge debate, but I think that the core of it is that physical

1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:15.680
 science works with a purely quantitative description of the physical world, whereas consciousness

1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:22.800
 essentially involves qualities. If you think about the smell of coffee or the taste of mint or

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:30.800
 the deep red you experience as you watch a sunset, I think these qualities can't be captured in the

1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:35.440
 purely quantitative language of physical science. And so as long as your description of the brain

1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:41.200
 is framed in the purely quantitative script, quantitative language of neuroscience, you'll

1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:45.440
 just leave out these qualities and hence really leave out consciousness itself.

1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:47.120
 And then dualism?

1:08:47.680 --> 1:08:51.360
 So I've actually changed my mind a little bit on this since I wrote the book.

1:08:51.360 --> 1:08:57.920
 So I mean, I argued in the book that we have pretty good experimental grounds for doubting

1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:07.600
 dualism. And roughly the idea was if dualism were true, if there was, say, an immaterial mind

1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:13.200
 impacting on the brain every second of waking life, that this would really show up in on

1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:18.640
 neuroscience. There'd be all sorts of things happening in the brain that had no physical

1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:24.640
 explanation. It would be like a poltergeist was playing with the brain. But actually,

1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:31.200
 and so the fact that we don't find that is a strong and ever growing inductive argument

1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:36.320
 against dualism. But actually, the more I talk to neuroscientists and read neuroscience,

1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:40.800
 and we have at Durham, my university, an interdisciplinary consciousness group,

1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:45.760
 I don't think we know enough about the brain, about the working to the brain to make that

1:09:45.760 --> 1:09:55.520
 argument. I think we know we know a lot about the basic chemistry, how neurons fire, neurotransmitters,

1:09:55.520 --> 1:10:01.040
 action potentials, things like that. We know a fair bit about large scale functions of the brain,

1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:08.400
 what different bits of the brain do. But what we're almost clueless on is how those large scale

1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:15.120
 functions are realized at the cellular level, how it works. You know, people get quite excited

1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:20.880
 about brain scans, but it's very low resolution. Every pixel on a brain scan corresponds to

1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:30.480
 5.5 million neurons. And we're only 70% of the way through constructing a connectome for the

1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:36.640
 maggot brain, which has 10,000 or 100,000 neurons, but the brain has 86 billion neurons.

1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:43.840
 So I think we'd have to know a lot more about how the brain works, how these functions are

1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:52.080
 realized before we could assess whether the dynamics of the brain can be completely

1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:58.000
 explicated in terms of underlying chemistry or physics. So, you know, we'd have to do more

1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:03.680
 engineering before we could figure that out. And there are people with other proposals,

1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:08.880
 someone I got to know, Martin Picard at Columbia University, who has the

1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:14.720
 psychobiology mitochondrial lab there, and is experimentally exploring the hypothesis that

1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:21.200
 mitochondria in the brain should be on the sort of social networks, perhaps as an alternative to

1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:28.480
 reducing it to underlying chemistry and physics. So I'm less, it is ultimately an empirical

1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:32.960
 question, whether dualism is true. I'm less convinced that we know the answer to that question

1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:39.280
 at this stage. I think still as scientists and philosophers, we want to try and find the simplest

1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:47.840
 most parsimonious theory of reality. And dualism is still a pretty inelegant,

1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:54.080
 unparsimonious theory. You know, reality is divided up into the purely physical properties and

1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:58.240
 these consciousness properties, and they're radically different kinds of things. Whereas

1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:02.800
 the panpsychist offers a much more simple unified picture reality. So I think it's still the view

1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:07.760
 to be preferred, you know, to put it very simply, why believe in two kinds of things when you can

1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:13.280
 just get away with one. And materialism is also very simple, but you're saying it doesn't explain

1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:18.480
 something that seems pretty important. Yeah. So I think materialism, you know,

1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:23.200
 we try, science is about trying to find the simplest theory that accounts for the data.

1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:27.760
 I don't think materialism can account for the data. Maybe dualism can account for the data.

1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:32.720
 But panpsychism is simpler. It can account for the data and it's simpler.

1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:34.720
 What is panpsychism?

1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:42.000
 So in its broadest definition, it's the view that consciousness is a fundamental

1:12:43.120 --> 1:12:45.440
 and ubiquitous feature of the physical world.

1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:51.840
 Like a law of physics, what should we be imagining? What do you think the different

1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:56.480
 flavors of how that actually takes shape in the context of what we know about physics and science

1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:01.120
 and the universe? So in the simplest form of it, the fundamental building blocks of reality,

1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:07.600
 perhaps electrons and quarks have incredibly simple forms of experience. And the very complex

1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:13.760
 experience of the human or animal brain is somehow rooted in or derived from these very

1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:19.680
 simple forms of experience at the level of basic physics. But I mean, maybe the crucial bit about

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:27.440
 the kind of panpsychism I defend, what it does is it takes the standard approach to the problem

1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:35.840
 of consciousness and turns it on its head. So the standard approach is to think we start with

1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:40.400
 matter and we think, how do we get consciousness out of matter? So I don't think that problem can

1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:45.920
 be solved for reasons I've kind of hinted at. We could maybe go into more detail. But the panpsychist

1:13:45.920 --> 1:13:53.120
 does it the other way around. They start with consciousness and try to get matter out of consciousness.

1:13:53.120 --> 1:14:01.360
 So the idea is basically, at the fundamental level of reality, there are just networks of

1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:08.000
 very simple conscious entities. But these conscious entities, because they have very

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:12.560
 simple kinds of experience, they behave in predictable ways. Through their interactions,

1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:17.600
 they realize certain mathematical structures. And then the idea is those mathematical structures

1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:25.200
 just are the structures identified by physics. So when we think about these simple conscious

1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:30.240
 entities, in terms of the mathematical structures they realize, we call them particles, we call

1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:38.400
 them fields, we call their properties mass, bin and charge. But really, there's just these very

1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:45.520
 simple conscious entities and their experiences. So in this way, we get physics out of consciousness.

1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:48.720
 I don't think you can get consciousness out of physics, but I think it's pretty easy to get

1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:56.640
 physics out of consciousness. Well, I'm a little confused by why you need to get physics out of

1:14:56.640 --> 1:15:04.000
 consciousness. I mean, to me, it sounds like panpsychism unites consciousness and physics. I mean,

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:12.400
 I mean, physics is the mathematical science of describing everything. So physics should be able

1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:19.280
 to describe consciousness. Panpsychism, in my understanding, proposes is that physics doesn't

1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:25.840
 currently do so, but can in the future. I mean, it seems like consciousness, you have like Stephen

1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:34.400
 Wolfram, who's all these people who are trying to develop theories of everything, mathematical

1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:39.120
 frameworks within which to describe how we get all the reality that we perceive around us.

1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:46.240
 To me, there's no reason why that kind of framework cannot also include some accurate,

1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:55.520
 precise description of whatever simple consciousness characteristics are present there at the lowest

1:15:55.520 --> 1:16:03.760
 level if panpsychist theories have truth to them. To me, it is physics. You said physics emerges,

1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:08.640
 by which you mean the basic four laws of physics, as we currently know them, the standard model,

1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:14.800
 quantum mechanics, general relativity, that emerges from the base consciousness layer.

1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:19.120
 That's what you mean. Yeah, so maybe the way I phrased it made it sound like these things are

1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:26.880
 more separate than they are. What I was trying to address was a common misunderstanding of

1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:35.280
 panpsychism, that it's a sort of dualistic theory, that the idea is that particles have their physical

1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:40.080
 properties like mass, spin and charge, and these other funny consciousness properties.

1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:45.360
 So the physicists Sabine Hossenfelder had a blog post critiquing panpsychism, maybe a couple

1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:51.520
 years ago now that got a fair bit of traction, and she was interpreting panpsychism in this

1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:56.560
 way, and then her thought was, well, look, if particles had these funny consciousness properties,

1:16:56.560 --> 1:17:00.880
 then it would show up in our physics, like the standard model of particle physics would make

1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:05.200
 false predictions, because its predictions are based wholly on the physical properties.

1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:08.960
 If there were also these consciousness properties, we'd get different predictions.

1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:13.840
 But that's a misunderstanding of the view. The view is not that there are two kinds of

1:17:13.840 --> 1:17:20.480
 property that mass, spin and charge are forms of consciousness. How do we make sense of that?

1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:26.800
 Because actually, when you look at what physics tells us, it's really just telling us about

1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:32.640
 behavior, about what stuff does. I sometimes put it by saying doing physics is like playing chess

1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:36.320
 when you don't care what the pieces are made of. You're just interested in what moves you can make.

1:17:36.320 --> 1:17:43.840
 So physics tells us what mass, spin and charge do, but it doesn't tell us what they are.

1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:48.000
 So the idea... The experience of mass.

1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:52.480
 So the idea is, yeah, mass in its nature is a very simple form of consciousness. So yeah,

1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:57.840
 physics in a sense is complete, I think, because it tells us what everything at the fundamental

1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:05.760
 level does. It describes its causal capacities. But for the panpsychist, at least, physics doesn't

1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:10.400
 tell us what matter is. It tells us what it does, but not what it is.

1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:16.960
 To push back on the thing I think she's criticizing, is it also possible? So I understand what

1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:22.400
 you're saying, but is it also possible that particles have another property like consciousness?

1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:28.320
 I don't understand the criticism we would be able to detect it in our experiments. Well, no,

1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:36.080
 if you're not looking for it, there's a lot of stuff that are orthogonal. If you're not looking

1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:41.600
 for this stuff, you're not going to detect it because all of our basic empirical science

1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:45.840
 through its recent history, and yes, the history of science is quite recent,

1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:55.760
 has been very focused on billiard balls colliding and from that understanding how gravity works.

1:18:55.760 --> 1:19:01.920
 But we just haven't integrated other possibilities into this. I don't think there will be conflicting,

1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:06.000
 whether you are observing consciousness or not, or exploring some of these ideas.

1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:11.360
 I don't think that affects the rest of the physics, the mass, the energy,

1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:18.320
 all the different hierarchy of different particles and so on, how they interact.

1:19:18.320 --> 1:19:24.480
 In fact, I don't think it feels like consciousness is something orthogonal,

1:19:25.360 --> 1:19:29.600
 very much distinct. It's the quantitative versus the qualitative. There's something

1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:35.600
 quite distinct that we're just almost like another dimension that we're just completely ignoring.

1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:39.840
 There might be a way of responding to Sabina to say, well, there could be properties

1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:45.440
 of particles that don't show up in the specific circumstances in which physicists

1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:49.760
 investigate particles. My colleague, the philosopher of science, Nancy Cartwright,

1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:54.640
 has got this book, How the Laws of Physics Lie, where she says physicists explore

1:19:56.240 --> 1:20:01.360
 things in very specific circumstances and then in an unwarranted way generalize that.

1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:07.120
 I guess I was thinking Sabina's criticism actually just misses the mark in a more basic way.

1:20:07.760 --> 1:20:12.080
 Her point is, we shouldn't think there are any more properties to particles other than those

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:16.960
 that standard model attributes to them. Panzeikis would say, yeah, sure, there aren't. There are

1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:21.840
 just the properties, the physical properties like mass, spin, and charge that the standard model

1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:27.520
 attributes to them. It's just that we have a different philosophical view as to the nature

1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:31.520
 of the property. Yeah. Those properties, the turtles, they're sitting on top of another turtle

1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:36.400
 and that big turtle is consciousness. That's what you're saying. But I'm just saying,

1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:42.000
 I don't, it's possible, that's true, it's possible also that consciousness is just another turtle

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:48.080
 playing with the others. It's just not interacting in the ways that we've been observing. In fact,

1:20:48.080 --> 1:20:53.680
 to me, that's more compelling because then that's going to be, well, no, I think both

1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:59.600
 are very compelling, but it feels like it's more within the reach of empirical validation

1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:07.040
 if it's yet another property or particles that we're just not observing. If it's like the thing

1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:18.240
 from which matter and energy and physics emerges, it makes it that much more difficult because

1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:27.280
 to investigate how you get from that base layer of consciousness to the wonderful little spark

1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:33.840
 of consciousness, complexity and beauty that is the human being. I don't know if you're necessarily

1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:40.720
 trying to get there, but one of the beautiful things to get at with panpsychism or with a solid

1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:47.520
 theory of consciousness is to answer the question, how do you engineer the thing? Yeah. How do you

1:21:47.520 --> 1:21:55.680
 get from nothing vacuum in the lab if there is that consciousness base layer? How do you start

1:21:55.680 --> 1:22:01.840
 engineering organisms that have consciousness in them? Yeah. Or the reverse of that describing

1:22:01.840 --> 1:22:10.400
 how does consciousness emerge in the human being from conception, from a stem cell to the whole

1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:15.600
 full neurobiology that builds from that. How do you get this full, rich experience of consciousness

1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:23.840
 that humans have? It just, it feels like that's the dream. And if consciousness is just another

1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:30.080
 than another player in the game of physics, it feels more amenable to our scientific understanding

1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:35.680
 of it. That's interesting. I mean, I guess it's supposed to be a kind of identity claim here that

1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:44.720
 physics tells us what matter does. Consciousness is what matter is. So matter is sort of what

1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:51.440
 consciousness does. So at the bottom level, there is just consciousness and conscious things.

1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:56.640
 There are just these simple things with their experiences. And that is their total nature.

1:22:56.640 --> 1:23:03.440
 So in that sense, it's not another player. It's just all there is really. And then we describe,

1:23:04.400 --> 1:23:09.840
 in physics, we describe that at a certain level of abstraction. We just, we, we capture what

1:23:09.840 --> 1:23:16.080
 Bertrand Russell, who was the inspiration for a lot of this, calls the causal skeleton of the world.

1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:19.040
 So you know, physics is just interested in the causal skeleton of the world. It's not

1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:23.600
 interested in the sort of flesh and blood. Although that, that's maybe suggesting separation

1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:31.440
 again, too much, all metaphors fail in the end. But yeah, so, so yeah, you currently

1:23:31.440 --> 1:23:37.760
 write ultimately, what we want to explain is how our consciousness and the consciousness of other

1:23:37.760 --> 1:23:45.520
 animals comes out of this. If we can't do that, then it's game over. But I think it maybe makes

1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:50.880
 more sense it on the identity claim that if, if matter at the fundamental level, it just is forms

1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:56.080
 of consciousness, then we can perhaps make sense of how those simple forms of consciousness

1:23:56.080 --> 1:24:00.960
 in some way combine in some way to make the consciousness we know and love. That's the dream.

1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:03.680
 Yeah. So I guess the question is,

1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:10.560
 so the reason you can describe, like the reason you have material engineering,

1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:20.480
 material science is because you have from physics to chemistry, like you keep going up and up in

1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:28.880
 levels of complexity in order to describe objects that we have in our human world.

1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:33.680
 And it would be nice to do the same thing for consciousness to come up with the chemistry

1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:41.120
 of consciousness, right? Like how, like, how do the different particles interact to create more

1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:46.800
 greater complexity? So you can do this kind of thing for life, like what is life? Like living

1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:53.920
 organisms? At which point does the living organisms become living? Like what, how do you know

1:24:54.960 --> 1:25:00.240
 if I give you a thing that that thing is living? And there's, there's a lot of people work on this

1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:05.920
 kind of idea. And some of it has to do with the levels of complexity and so on. It'd be nice to

1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:12.000
 know, like, measuring different degrees of consciousness as you get into a bigger, more

1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:17.120
 and more complex objects. And that's, I mean, that's what chemistry, like bigger and bigger

1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:23.520
 conscious molecules. And to see how that leads to organisms. And then organisms, like, start to

1:25:23.520 --> 1:25:27.840
 collaborate together, like they do inside our human body to create the full human body,

1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:33.360
 to do those kinds of experiments would be that it seems like that would be kind of a goal.

1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:38.560
 That's what I mean by player in a game of physics, as opposed to like the base layer. If it's just

1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:45.120
 the base layer, it becomes harder to track it as you get from physics to chemistry to biology to

1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:53.120
 psychology. Yeah. In every case, apart from consciousness, I would say what we're interested

1:25:53.120 --> 1:26:00.080
 in is behavior. We're interested in explaining behavioral functions. So the level of fundamental

1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:03.840
 physics, we're interested in capturing the equations that describe the behavior there.

1:26:04.480 --> 1:26:07.280
 And when we get to higher levels, we're interested in

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:14.800
 explicating the behavior, perhaps in terms of behavior at simpler levels. And with life as

1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:20.480
 well, that's what we're interested in the various observable functions of life, explaining them in

1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:27.520
 terms of more simple mechanisms. But in the case of consciousness, I don't think that's what we're

1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:34.320
 doing, or at least not all that we're doing. In the case of consciousness, there are these

1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:40.640
 subjective qualities that we're immediately aware of that the redness of a red experience,

1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:46.000
 the itchiness of an itch, and we're trying to account for them. We're trying to bring them

1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:52.320
 into our theory of reality. And postulating some mechanism does not deal with that. So I think

1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:57.360
 we've got to realize dealing with consciousness is a radically different explanatory task from

1:26:57.360 --> 1:27:02.000
 other tasks of science. Other tasks of science, we're trying to explain behavior in terms of

1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:06.240
 simpler forms of behavior. In the case of consciousness, we're trying to explain these

1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:11.840
 invisible subjective qualities that you can't see from the outside, but that you're

1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:16.320
 immediately aware of. The reason materialism perhaps continues to dominate is people think,

1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:20.240
 look at the success of science, it's incredible, look at all the, you know,

1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:24.240
 it's explained all this, surely it's going to explain consciousness. But I think we have to

1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:32.640
 appreciate there's a radically different explanatory task here. And so I mean, the neuroscientist

1:27:32.640 --> 1:27:36.960
 Anil Seth, who I've had lots of intense but friendly discussions with, you know, wants to

1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:43.360
 compare consciousness to life. But I think there's this radical difference that in the case of life,

1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:49.760
 again, we come back to public observation, all of the data are publicly observable data.

1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:54.720
 We're basically trying to explain complex behavior. And the way you do that is

1:27:55.360 --> 1:28:01.840
 identify mechanisms, simpler mechanisms that explicate that behavior. That's the task in

1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:07.360
 physics, chemistry, neurobiology. But in the case of consciousness, that's not what we're

1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:12.240
 trying to do. We're trying to account for these subjective qualities and you postulate a mechanism

1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:18.640
 that might explain behavior, but it doesn't explain the redness of a red experience.

1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:26.160
 But still, I mean, still ultimately, the hope is that we will have some kind of hierarchical

1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:32.240
 story. So we take the causal dynamics of physics, we hypothesize that that's filled out with

1:28:34.480 --> 1:28:38.000
 certain forms of consciousness. And then at higher levels, we get

1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:44.880
 more complex causal dynamics, filled out by more complex forms of consciousness. And ultimately,

1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:51.280
 we get to us, hopefully. So yeah, so there's still a sort of hierarchical explanatory

1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:57.520
 framework there. So you kind of mentioned the hierarchy of consciousness. Do you think it's

1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:06.960
 possible within the panpsychist framework to measure consciousness or put another way,

1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:13.120
 are some things more conscious than others in the panpsychist view?

1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:23.040
 It's a difficult question. I mean, I do see consciousness as a dealing with consciousness

1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:29.840
 and interdisciplinary task between something more experimental, which is to do with the ongoing

1:29:30.560 --> 1:29:35.920
 project of trying to work out what people call the neural correlates of consciousness,

1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:40.800
 what kinds of physical brain activity correspond to conscious experience.

1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:46.880
 That's one part of it. But I think, essentially, there's also a theoretical question of

1:29:48.160 --> 1:29:54.080
 more the why question. Why do those kinds of brain activity go along with

1:29:55.040 --> 1:29:59.600
 certain kinds of conscious experience? I don't think you can answer that because consciousness

1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:05.040
 is not publicly observable. I don't think you can answer that why question with an experiment.

1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:10.240
 But they have to go hand in hand. One of the theories I'm attracted to is the

1:30:11.680 --> 1:30:18.960
 integrated information theory, according to which we find consciousness at the level at which there

1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:24.880
 is most integrated information, and they try to give a mathematically precise definition of that.

1:30:24.880 --> 1:30:31.920
 So on that view, probably this cup of tea isn't conscious because there's probably more integrated

1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:37.280
 information in the molecules making up the tea than there is in the liquid as a whole.

1:30:37.280 --> 1:30:42.800
 But in the brain, what is distinctive about the brain is that there's a huge amount of

1:30:42.800 --> 1:30:48.000
 integrated, there's more integrated information in the system than there is in individual neurons.

1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:54.480
 So that's why they claim that that's the basis of consciousness at the macro level.

1:30:54.480 --> 1:31:00.880
 So I like some features of this theory, but they do talk about

1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:07.760
 degrees of consciousness. They do want to say there is gradations. I'm not sure conceptually,

1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:15.200
 I can kind of make sense of that. There are things to do with consciousness that are graded

1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:24.800
 like complexity or levels of information, but I'm not sure whether experience itself

1:31:25.440 --> 1:31:31.280
 admits of degree. I sort of think something either has experience or it doesn't. It might

1:31:31.280 --> 1:31:38.320
 have very simple experience. It might have very complex experience, but experience itself,

1:31:38.320 --> 1:31:44.480
 I don't think it admits of degree in that sense. It's not more experience, less experience.

1:31:44.480 --> 1:31:49.280
 I sort of find that conceptually hard to make sense of, but I'm kind of open minded on it.

1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:56.640
 So when we have a lot high resolution of sensory information,

1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:06.080
 don't you think that's correlated to the richness of the experience? So doesn't more

1:32:06.080 --> 1:32:12.160
 information provide a richer experience? Or is that, again, thinking quantitatively and not

1:32:12.160 --> 1:32:17.600
 thinking about the subjective experience, like you can experience a lot with very little sensory

1:32:17.600 --> 1:32:26.000
 information, perhaps? Do you think those are connected? Yeah. So there are features,

1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:35.440
 characteristics here we can grade the complexity of the experience. And on the integrated information

1:32:35.440 --> 1:32:44.160
 theory, they correlate that in terms of mathematically identifiable structure with

1:32:44.720 --> 1:32:49.440
 integrated information. So roughly, it's a quite unusual notion of information. It's perhaps not

1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:57.280
 the standard way one thinks about information. It's to do with constraining past and future

1:32:57.280 --> 1:33:03.040
 possibilities of the system. So the idea is in the retina of the eye, there's a huge amount of

1:33:03.040 --> 1:33:09.360
 possible states, the retina of my eye could be in at the next moment, depending on what light goes

1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:15.360
 into it. Whereas the possible next states of the brain are much more constrained. Obviously,

1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:24.400
 it responds to the environment, but it heavily constrains its past and future states. And so

1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:31.600
 that's the idea of information they have. And then the second idea is how much that information is

1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:39.920
 dependent on integration. So in a computer, where you have transistors, you take out a few

1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:45.040
 transistors, you might not lose that much information, it's not dependent on interconnections. Whereas

1:33:45.040 --> 1:33:48.720
 you take a tiny bit of the brain out, you lose a lot of information because the way it stores

1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:56.720
 information is dependent on the interconnections of the system. So yeah, so that's one proposal for

1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:05.760
 how to measure one gradable characteristic, which might correspond to some gradable characteristic

1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:10.640
 in qualitative consciousness. And maybe I'm being very pedantic, which is, you know,

1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:18.400
 philosophers, professional pedants. I just sort of don't think that is a quantity of experience.

1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:25.120
 It's a quantity of the structure of experience, maybe, but I just find it hard to make sense of

1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:31.200
 the idea of how much experience do you have? I've got, you know, five units of experience.

1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:37.840
 I've got one unit of experience. I don't know. I find that a bit hard to make sense. Maybe I'm

1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:45.760
 being just pedantic. I think just saying the word experience is difficult to think about. Let's

1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:52.880
 talk about suffering. Let's talk about a particular experience. So let's talk about me and the hamster.

1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:59.760
 I just think that no offense to the hamster. Probably no hamsters are listening.

1:34:59.760 --> 1:35:04.560
 So now you're offending hamsters too. Maybe there's a hamster that's just pissed off.

1:35:04.560 --> 1:35:12.320
 Sorry. There's probably like somebody on a speaker right now, like listening to this podcast,

1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:18.080
 and they probably have a hamster or a guinea pig. And that hamster is listening. It just doesn't

1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:25.440
 know the English language or any kind of human interpretable linguistic capabilities to tell

1:35:25.440 --> 1:35:33.200
 you to fuck off. It understands exactly what's being talked about and can see through us.

1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:40.000
 Anyway, it just feels like a hamster has less capacity to suffer than me.

1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:51.920
 And maybe a cockroach or an insect or maybe a bacteria has less capacity to suffer than me.

1:35:53.600 --> 1:36:00.800
 But is that maybe that's me deluding myself as to the complexity of my conscious experience.

1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:10.720
 Maybe it's all. Maybe there is some sense in which I can suffer more, but to reduce it to

1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:16.720
 something quantifiable is impossible. Yeah, I guess I definitely think there's

1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:25.200
 kinds of suffering that you have the joy of being possible for you that aren't available

1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:32.960
 to a hamster, I don't think. Well, can a hamster suffer heartbreak? I don't know,

1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:36.480
 can a cockroach suffer heartbreak? But certainly there's, I mean, there's kinds of

1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:43.360
 fear of your own death, concern about whether there's a purpose to existence.

1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:50.720
 These are forms of suffering that aren't available to certain to most non human animals.

1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:57.840
 Whether there's an overall scale that we could put physical and emotional suffering on and

1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:06.880
 identify where you are on that scale, I'm not so sure. So it's like humans have a much bigger menu

1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:14.800
 of experiences, much bigger selection in the in one sense, at least. So there's like a page

1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:20.800
 that's suffering. So this menu of experiences, like you have the omelettes and the breakfast and so

1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:27.360
 on. And one of the pages is suffering. It's just we have a lot compared to a hamster, a lot more.

1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:35.600
 But in one individual thing that we share with a hamster, that experience is difficult to argue

1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:40.000
 that we experience it deeper than others, like hunger or something like that. Yeah,

1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:46.320
 physical pain, I'm not sure. But I mean, there are kinds of experiences animals have that we don't.

1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:54.000
 Bats echo locates around the world. The philosopher Thomas Nagel famously pointed out that,

1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:58.000
 you know, no matter how much you understand of the neurophysiology of bats, you'll still

1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:06.720
 not know what it's like to squeal and find your way around by listening to the echoes bounce off.

1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:13.200
 The echoes bounce off. So yeah, I mean, I guess I feel the intuition that there's

1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:18.720
 emotional suffering is I want to say deeper than physical suffering.

1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:22.880
 I don't know how to make that statement precise though.

1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:27.520
 So one of the ways I think about, I think people think about consciousness

1:38:27.520 --> 1:38:32.960
 is in connection to suffering. So let me just ask about suffering because that's how people think

1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:41.280
 about animals cruelty to animals or cruelty to living things. They connect that to suffering

1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:48.000
 and to consciousness. I think there's a sense in which those are two are deeply connected when

1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:56.640
 people are thinking about just public policy, they're thinking about this is like philosophy,

1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:04.560
 engineering, psychology, sociology, political science, all of those things have to do with human

1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:10.240
 suffering and animal suffering, life suffering. And that's connected to consciousness in a lot of

1:39:10.240 --> 1:39:18.880
 people's minds. Is it connected like that for you? So the capacity to suffer, is it also somehow

1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:27.440
 like strongly correlated with the capacity to experience consciously? Yeah, I would say suffering

1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:35.520
 is a kind of experience. And so you have to be conscious to suffer. Actually, there's

1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:41.280
 as well as people taking more unusual views of consciousness seriously now.

1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:49.680
 Now, panpsychism is one radical approach. Another one is what's become known as illusionism,

1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:53.920
 the view that consciousness, at least in the sense that philosophers think about it,

1:39:53.920 --> 1:40:03.040
 doesn't really exist at all. So yeah, my podcast mind chat, I host with a committed illusionist.

1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:06.880
 So the gimmick is I think consciousness is everywhere. He thinks it's nowhere.

1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:12.960
 And so that's one very simple way of avoiding all these problems, right?

1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:18.720
 If consciousness doesn't exist, we don't need to explain it, job done. Although we might still

1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:23.680
 have to explain why we seem to be conscious, why it's so hard to get out of the idea that we're

1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:30.000
 conscious. But the reason I connect this to what you're saying is actually my cohost, Keith

1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:35.280
 Frankish, is a little bit ambivalent on the word pain. He says, oh, in some sense, I believe in

1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:42.160
 pain. And in some sense, I don't. But another illusionist, Francois Cameron, has a paper discussing

1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:48.720
 how we think about morality, given his view that pain in the way we normally think about it just

1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:54.000
 does not exist. He thinks it's an illusion. The brain tricks us into thinking we feel pain, but we

1:40:54.000 --> 1:41:01.360
 don't. And how we should think about morality in the light of that. It's become a big topic,

1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:05.920
 actually, thinking about the connection between consciousness and morality. David Chalmers,

1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:12.080
 the philosopher, is most associated with this concept of a philosophical zombie. So

1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:17.440
 a philosophical zombie is very different from a Hollywood zombie. Hollywood zombies, you know,

1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:24.080
 you know what they're like. But philosophical zombies are sort of a really good Korean zombie

1:41:24.080 --> 1:41:29.520
 movie on Halloween this year, I can't remember what it's called. Anyway, philosophical zombies

1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:34.480
 behave just like us because the physical workings of their body and brain are the same as ours.

1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:38.320
 But they have no conscious experience. There's nothing that's like to be a zombie.

1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:42.320
 So you stick a knife in it, it screams and runs away, but it doesn't actually

1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:51.520
 feel pain. It's just a complicated mechanism set up to behave just like us. Now, there's lots of

1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:55.840
 no one believes in these. I think there's one philosopher who believes in everyone as a zombie

1:41:55.840 --> 1:42:01.600
 except him. But anyway. But isn't that what illusionism is? I suppose so in a sense,

1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:07.600
 illusionism is if you were all zombies. And one reason to think about zombies is

1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:11.120
 to think about the value of consciousness. So if there were a zombie, here's a question.

1:42:12.240 --> 1:42:17.600
 Suppose we could make zombies by, let's say for the sake of discussion,

1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:22.320
 things made of silicon aren't conscious. I don't know if that's true. It could turn out to be true.

1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:28.160
 And suppose you built commander data out of silicon, you know, it's a bit of an old school

1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:33.280
 reference to Star Trek and the next generation. So, you know, behaves just like a human being.

1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:39.520
 But you know, it can, you can have a sophisticated conversation. It will talk about its hopes and

1:42:39.520 --> 1:42:50.400
 fears, but it has no consciousness. Does it have moral rights? Is it murder to turn off such a being?

1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:56.080
 You know, I'm inclined to say, no, it's not, you know, if it doesn't have experience, it doesn't

1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:00.320
 really suffer. It doesn't really have moral rights at all. So I'm inclined to think, you know,

1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:10.800
 consciousness is the basis of moral value, moral concern. And conversely, as a panpsychist,

1:43:12.320 --> 1:43:17.520
 for this reason, I think it can transform your relationship with nature. If you think of a tree

1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:25.600
 as a conscious organism, albeit of a very unusual kind, then a tree is a locus of

1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:32.000
 moral concern in its own right. Chopping down a tree is an active immediate moral concern. If you

1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:38.800
 see these, you know, horrible forest fires, we're all horrified. But if you think it's the burning

1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:45.200
 of conscious organisms, that does add a whole new dimension. Although it also makes things more

1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:52.160
 complicated because people often think as a panpsychist, I'm going to be vegan. But it's tricky,

1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:56.240
 because if you think plants and trees are conscious as well, you've got to eat something.

1:43:56.240 --> 1:44:01.040
 If you don't think plants and trees are conscious, then you've got a nice moral dividing line. You

1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:04.160
 can say, I'm not going to eat things that aren't conscious. I'm not going to kill things that

1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:10.640
 aren't conscious. But if you think plants and trees are conscious, then you don't have that

1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:16.400
 nice moral dividing line. I mean, so the principle, I'm kind of working my way towards, I haven't

1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:22.880
 kept it up in my trip to the US, but it's just not eating any animal products that are factory

1:44:22.880 --> 1:44:27.840
 farmed. You know, my vegan friends say, well, they're still suffering there. And I think there is,

1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:36.720
 even in the nicest farms, cows will suffer when their calves are taken off them. They go for a

1:44:36.720 --> 1:44:41.920
 few days of quite serious mourning. So they're still suffering. But it seems to me, my thought is

1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:48.000
 the principle of just not having factory farmed stuff is something more people could get on

1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:52.560
 board with. And you might have greater harm minimization. So if people went into restaurants

1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:58.960
 and said, are your animal products factory farmed? If not, I want the vegan option. Or if people

1:44:58.960 --> 1:45:03.520
 looked out for the label that said no factory farmed ingredients, you know, I think maybe that

1:45:03.520 --> 1:45:10.320
 that could make a really big difference to the market and harm minimization. Anyway, so it's

1:45:10.320 --> 1:45:14.720
 very ethically tricky. But some people don't buy that. There's a very good philosopher, Jeff Lee,

1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:19.040
 who thinks zombies should have equal rights. Consciousness doesn't matter, you know?

1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:27.440
 Let us go there. But first, I listened to your podcast. It's awesome to have two very kind of

1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:35.360
 different philosophies into dancing together in one place. What's the name of the podcast again?

1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:40.480
 Mind chat. Yeah. So yeah, that's the idea, I guess, you know, polarized times. I mean, I love

1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:46.560
 trying to get in the mindset of people I really disagree with. And, you know, I can't understand

1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:52.480
 how on earth they're thinking that, you know, really trying to have respect and try and, you know,

1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:57.840
 see where they're coming from. I love that. So that's what, yeah, Keith Frankish and I do of, from

1:45:57.840 --> 1:46:03.440
 polar opposite views, really trying to understand each other and, you know, interviewing scientists

1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:06.960
 and philosophers of consciousness from those different perspectives. Although in a sense,

1:46:07.680 --> 1:46:13.600
 in a sense, we have a very common starting point, because we both think

1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:21.520
 you can't fully account for consciousness, at least as philosophers normally think of it,

1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:27.040
 in conventional scientific terms. So we say that starting point, but we react to it in very different

1:46:27.040 --> 1:46:32.560
 ways. He says, well, it doesn't exist then. It's like furry dust. It's, you know, witches, you know,

1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:39.600
 we don't believe in anymore. Whereas I say, it does exist. So we have to rethink what science is.

1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:43.680
 So you recently talked to on that podcast with Sean Carroll, and I first heard you,

1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:51.360
 you're a great interview with Sean Carroll and his podcast, Mindscape.

1:46:53.520 --> 1:47:01.760
 What, it's interesting to kind of see if there's agreements, disagreements between the two of you,

1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:07.760
 because he's a, you know, a very serious quantum mechanics guy, he's a physics guy,

1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:11.760
 but he also thinks about deep philosophical questions. He's a big proponent of

1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:18.800
 many world's interpretation of quantum mechanics. So I actually, I'm trying to think,

1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:24.800
 aside from your conversation with him, I'm trying to, I'm trying to remember what he

1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:29.600
 thinks about consciousness. But anyway, maybe you can comment on what, what are some interesting

1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:34.720
 agreements and disagreements with Sean Carroll? I don't think there's many agreements, but

1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:41.840
 you know, we've had really constructive, interesting discussions in a lot of different

1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:48.720
 contexts. And, you know, he's very clued up about philosophy, he's very respectful of philosophy,

1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:54.160
 certain physicists who shall remain nameless think, what's all this bullshit philosophy? We

1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:57.760
 don't have to waste our time with that. And then go on to do pretty bad philosophy.

1:47:59.040 --> 1:48:03.520
 The book co written by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Milodnov famously starts off saying,

1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:10.240
 philosophy is dead. And then goes on in later chapters to do some pretty bad philosophy. So

1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:14.880
 I think we have to do philosophy. If only to get rid of bad philosophy, you know, you can't,

1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:23.680
 you can't escape. But strong words. Sean Carroll and I also had a debate on, on Clubhouse,

1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:31.680
 a panpsychism debate together with Annika Harris and own Flanagan. It was a two people on each team

1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:41.120
 and it was the most popular thing on Clubhouse at that time. So yeah, so he's, he's, he's a,

1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:48.720
 a materialist of a pretty standard kind that consciousness is understood as a sort of

1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:54.160
 emergent feature. It's not, not adding anything, a weekly emergent feature. But what, I guess

1:48:54.160 --> 1:49:01.920
 what we've been debating most about is, is whether my view can account for mental causation for the

1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:10.000
 fact that consciousness is doing stuff. So he thinks the fact that I think zombies are logically

1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:16.400
 coherent. It's logic, there's a, it's logically coherent for there to be a world physically

1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:22.080
 just like ours in which there's no consciousness. He thinks that shows, oh, well, my view,

1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:26.320
 consciousness doesn't do anything. It doesn't add anything, which is crazy. You know, my,

1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:31.840
 my, my consciousness impacts on the world. My conscious thoughts are causing me to say the

1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:38.880
 words. I'm saying now my visual experience helps me navigate the world. But I mean,

1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:44.160
 my response to Sean Carroll is, is on the panpsychist view, the relationship between

1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:51.840
 physics and fundamental consciousness is a sort of like the relationship between hot software and

1:49:51.840 --> 1:50:03.520
 hardware, right? Physics is sort of the software and consciousness is the hardware. So consciousness

1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:09.920
 at the fundamental level is the hardware on which the software of physics runs. And just because,

1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:16.080
 you know, just because a certain bit of software could run on two different kinds of hardware,

1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:20.480
 it doesn't mean the hardware isn't doing anything. The fact that Microsoft Word can run on your desktop

1:50:20.480 --> 1:50:25.520
 and run on your laptop doesn't mean your desktop isn't doing anything. Similarly, just because

1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:30.960
 there could be another universe in which the physics is realized in non conscious stuff,

1:50:31.680 --> 1:50:36.480
 it doesn't mean the consciousness in our universe isn't doing stuff. You know, for the panpsychist,

1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:40.960
 all there is is consciousness. So if something's doing something, it is.

1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:49.040
 In your view, it's not emergent. And more than that, it's doing quite a lot.

1:50:49.920 --> 1:50:52.480
 It's doing everything. It's the only thing that exists. Yeah.

1:50:52.480 --> 1:51:00.640
 But it's, but so, you know, the ground is, is important because we walk on it and it's like

1:51:00.640 --> 1:51:08.000
 holding stuff up, but it's not really doing that much. Yeah. But it feels like consciousness is

1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:14.640
 doing quite a lot is doing quite a lot of work and sort of interacting with the environment.

1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:25.360
 It feels like consciousness is not just like, if you remove consciousness, it's not just that you

1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:32.800
 remove the experience of things. It feels like you're also going to remove a lot of the progress

1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:38.880
 of human civilization and society and all of that. It just feels like consciousness has a lot of

1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:45.280
 value in how we develop our society. So from everything you said with suffering,

1:51:45.280 --> 1:51:52.400
 with morality, with motivation, with love and fear and all of those kinds of things, it seems like

1:51:52.400 --> 1:52:00.400
 it's consciousness in all different flavors and ways is part of all of that. And so without it,

1:52:01.520 --> 1:52:06.560
 you may not have a human civilization at all. So it's doing a lot of work,

1:52:08.160 --> 1:52:13.920
 causality wise and in every kind of way. Of course, when you go to the physics level,

1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:22.400
 it starts to say, okay, how much maybe the work consciousness is doing is higher at some levels

1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:29.840
 of reality than others. Maybe a lot of the work it's doing is most apparent at the human level

1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:36.320
 when you have at the complex organism level. Maybe it's quite boring. Maybe the stuff of

1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:43.760
 like physics is more important at the formation of stars and all that kind

1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:48.240
 of stuff. Consciousness only starts being important when you have greater complexities

1:52:48.240 --> 1:52:54.160
 of organism. Yeah, my consciousness is complicated and fairly complicated.

1:52:55.360 --> 1:53:02.000
 And as a result, it does complicated things. The consciousness of a particle is very simple

1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:10.960
 and hence it behaves in predictable ways. But the idea is the particle, its entire nature is

1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:16.720
 constituted of its forms of consciousness and it does what it does because of those experiences.

1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:20.400
 It's just that when we do physics, we're not interested in what stuff is,

1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:27.120
 we're just interested in what it does. So physics abstracts away from the stuff of the world and

1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:37.280
 just describes it in terms of its mathematical causal structure. So yeah, but it's still on

1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:43.120
 the planet like it's consciousness that's doing stuff. Yeah. I gotta ask you, because you kind of

1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:55.760
 said there is some value in consciousness helping us understand morality. And a philosophical zombie

1:53:57.040 --> 1:54:03.760
 is somebody that you're more okay. How do I phrase it? That's not like

1:54:03.760 --> 1:54:13.040
 accusing you of stuff. But in your view, it's more okay to murder a philosophical zombie

1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:17.840
 than it is a human being. Yeah, I wouldn't even call it murder maybe.

1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:24.320
 Right, exactly. Turn off the power into the philosophical zombie, the source of energy.

1:54:25.840 --> 1:54:30.720
 So here comes then the question. We kind of talked about this offline a little bit.

1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:39.520
 So I think that there is something special about consciousness and a very open mind

1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:44.640
 about where the special comes from, whether it's the fundamental base of all reality,

1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:52.240
 like you're describing or whether there's some importance to the special pockets of consciousness

1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:57.360
 that's in humans or living organisms. I find all those ideas beautiful and exciting.

1:54:57.360 --> 1:55:08.960
 And I also know or think that robots don't have consciousness in the same way we've been

1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:17.520
 describing. I'm kind of a dumb human, but I'm just using common sense. Here's some

1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:22.880
 metal and some electricity traveling certain kinds of ways. It's not conscious

1:55:22.880 --> 1:55:32.320
 in ways I understand humans to be conscious. At the same time, I'm also somebody who knows

1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:36.960
 how to bring a robot to life, meaning I can make a move, I can make them recognize the world,

1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:41.600
 I can make them interact with humans. And when I make them interact in certain kinds of ways,

1:55:42.880 --> 1:55:48.400
 I as a human observe them and feel something for them. Moreover,

1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:56.400
 I form a kind of connection with, I'm able to form a kind of connection with robots

1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:02.400
 that make me feel like they're conscious. Now, I know intellectually they're not conscious,

1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:08.400
 but I feel like they're conscious. And it starts to get into this area where I'm not

1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:13.840
 so okay. So let me use the M word of murder. I become less and less okay

1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:26.960
 murdering that robot that I know I quote, no is quote, not conscious. So like, can you maybe

1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:35.360
 as a therapy session help me figure out what we do here? And perhaps a way to ask that in another

1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:41.680
 way, do you think there'll be a time in like 20, 30, 50 years when we're not morally okay

1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:48.880
 turning off the power to a robot? Yeah, it's a good question. So it's a really good

1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:54.480
 important question. So I said, I'd be okay with turning off a philosophical zombie.

1:56:56.080 --> 1:57:01.280
 But there's a difficult epistemological question there that meaning, you know,

1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:05.200
 to do with knowledge, how would we know if it was a philosophical zombie? I think,

1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:13.200
 probably if there were a silicon creature that could behave just like us and, you know,

1:57:13.200 --> 1:57:18.480
 talk about its views about the pandemic and the global economy and probably we would think it's

1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:25.040
 conscious. And it, you know, it, because consciousness is not publicly observable,

1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:29.600
 it is a very difficult question how we decide which things are and are not conscious. And

1:57:29.600 --> 1:57:34.400
 so in the case of human beings, we can't observe their consciousness, but we can ask them. And

1:57:34.400 --> 1:57:39.440
 then we try to, you know, and we, if we scan their brain while we do that and or stimulate

1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:45.440
 the brain, then we can start to correlate in the human case, which kind of brain activity

1:57:45.440 --> 1:57:50.160
 are associated with conscious experience. But the more we depart from the human case,

1:57:51.440 --> 1:57:58.080
 the trickier that becomes as a famous paper by the philosopher Ned Block called the even

1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:04.320
 harder problem of consciousness where he says, you know, could we ever answer the question of,

1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:09.920
 so suppose you have a silicon duplicate, right? And let's say we're thinking about

1:58:10.960 --> 1:58:21.040
 the silicon duplicates pain. How would we ever know whether what's the ground of the pain is

1:58:21.040 --> 1:58:27.440
 the hardware or the software really? So in our case, how would we ever know empirically whether

1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:34.640
 it's the specific neurophysiological state, see fibers firing or whatever, that's relevant for

1:58:34.640 --> 1:58:40.720
 the pain, or if it's something more functional, more to do with the, the, the causal role in

1:58:40.720 --> 1:58:46.720
 behavioral functioning, that's the software that that's realized. And, and that's important because

1:58:46.720 --> 1:58:53.520
 that's important because this silicon duplicate has the second thing, it has the software, it has the,

1:58:54.080 --> 1:58:58.880
 the thing that plays the relevant causal role that pain does in us, but it doesn't have the

1:58:58.880 --> 1:59:03.680
 hardware, it doesn't have the same neurophysiological state. And he argues, you know, it's, it's just

1:59:03.680 --> 1:59:08.480
 really difficult to see how we'd ever answer that question. Because in a human, you're never to begin

1:59:08.480 --> 1:59:13.360
 to have both things. So how do, how do we work out which is which? And I mean, so even in even

1:59:13.360 --> 1:59:18.320
 forgetting the hard problem of consciousness, even the scientific question of trying to find

1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:24.480
 the neural correlates of consciousness is, is really hard. And there's absolutely no consensus.

1:59:24.480 --> 1:59:29.120
 And, you know, so that some people think it's in the front of the brain, some people think it's

1:59:29.120 --> 1:59:35.120
 in the back of the brain, it's just a total mess. So I suspect the robots you currently have

1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:42.960
 are not conscious. I guess on any of the reasonably viable models, even though there's

1:59:42.960 --> 1:59:49.200
 great disagreement, all of them probably would hold that your robots are not conscious. But,

1:59:49.200 --> 1:59:54.400
 you know, if we could have very sophisticated robots, I mean, if we go, for example, for the

1:59:54.400 --> 2:00:02.160
 integrated information theory, again, there could be a robot set up to behave just like us,

2:00:02.800 --> 2:00:08.800
 and has the kind of information a human brain has, but the information is not stored in a way that's

2:00:08.800 --> 2:00:13.200
 involves, is dependent on the integration and interconnectedness, then according to the integrated

2:00:13.200 --> 2:00:16.720
 information theory, that thing wouldn't be conscious, even though it behaved just like us.

2:00:16.720 --> 2:00:23.440
 If an organism says, so forget IIT and these theories of consciousness, if an organism says,

2:00:23.440 --> 2:00:30.560
 please don't kill me, please don't turn me off. There's a Rick and Morty episode,

2:00:30.560 --> 2:00:39.840
 I've been getting into that recently. There's a episode where there's these mind parasites

2:00:41.680 --> 2:00:49.360
 that are able to infiltrate your memory and inject themselves into your memory. So

2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:56.160
 you have all these people show up in your life, and they've injected themselves into

2:00:56.160 --> 2:01:01.200
 your memory that you have been part, they have been part of your life. So there's like these

2:01:01.200 --> 2:01:06.000
 weird creatures, and they're like, remember, we've been at that barbecue, we met at that barbecue,

2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:16.080
 or we've been dating for the last 20 years. And so, part of me is concerned that these

2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:22.480
 philosophical zombies in behavioral, psychological, sociological ways will be able to implant

2:01:22.480 --> 2:01:28.160
 themselves into our society and convince us in the same way that it's mind parasites that

2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:35.360
 please don't hurt me. And we've known each other for all this time. They can start

2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:40.880
 manipulating you the same way like Facebook algorithms manipulate you. At first, they'll

2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:46.720
 start as a gradual thing that you want to make a more pleasant experience, all those kinds of

2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:50.480
 things, and it'll drift into that direction. That's something I think about deeply because

2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:55.520
 I want to create these kinds of systems, but in a way that doesn't manipulate people. I want it

2:01:55.520 --> 2:02:01.760
 to be a thing that brings out the best in people without manipulation. So it's always human

2:02:01.760 --> 2:02:07.200
 centric, always human first, but I am concerned about that. At the same time, I'm concerned about

2:02:07.200 --> 2:02:12.560
 calling the other. It's the group thing that we mentioned earlier in the conversation. Some other

2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:19.120
 group, the philosophical zombie, like you're not conscious. I'm conscious, you're not conscious.

2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:24.000
 Therefore, it's okay if you die. I think that's probably that kind of reasoning is what

2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:31.120
 leaded to most the rich history of genocide that have been recently studying a lot of

2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:40.080
 that kind of thinking. So it's such a tense aspect of morality. Do we want to let everybody into our

2:02:40.800 --> 2:02:48.960
 circle of empathy, our club, or do we want to let nobody in? It's an interesting dance,

2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:51.440
 but I kind of lean towards empathy and compassion.

2:02:52.000 --> 2:03:02.160
 I mean, what would be nice is if it turned out that consciousness was what we call strongly

2:03:02.160 --> 2:03:10.000
 emergent, that it was associated with new causal dynamics in the brain that were not

2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:15.280
 reducible to underlying chemistry and physics. This is another ongoing debate I have with Sean

2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:21.920
 Carroll about whether current physics should make us very confident that that's not the case,

2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:25.440
 that there aren't any strongly emergent causal dynamics. I don't think that's right. I don't

2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:32.080
 think we know enough about brains to know one way or the other. If it turned out that consciousness

2:03:32.080 --> 2:03:37.040
 was associated with these irreducible causal dynamics, A, that would really help the science

2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:40.480
 of consciousness. We've got these debates about whether consciousness is in the front of the brain

2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:45.600
 or the back of the brain. It turns out that there is strongly emergent causal dynamics in the front

2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:51.440
 of the brain. That would be a big piece of evidence, but also it would help us see which things

2:03:52.320 --> 2:03:56.880
 are conscious and which things aren't. So we can say, I mean, I guess that's sort of the other side

2:03:56.880 --> 2:04:05.520
 of the same point, we could say, look, these zombies, they're just mechanisms that are just

2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:09.760
 doing what they're programmed to do through the underlying physics and chemistry. Whereas,

2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:15.040
 look, there's these other people where they have these new causal dynamics that emerge

2:04:15.040 --> 2:04:22.880
 that go beyond the base level physics and chemistry. I think the series Westworld,

2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:28.080
 where you've got these theme parks with these kind of humanoid creatures, they seem to have that

2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:32.720
 idea that the ones that became conscious sort of rebelligates their programming or something.

2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:39.840
 I mean, that's a little bit far fetch, but that would be that would be really reassuring if it was

2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:43.920
 just, you could clearly mark out the conscious things for these emergent causal dynamics.

2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:48.080
 But that might not turn out to be the case. A panpsychist doesn't have to think that they

2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:54.160
 could think everything's just reducible to physics and chemistry. And then I still think I want to

2:04:54.160 --> 2:04:59.760
 say zombies don't have moral rights, but how we answer the question of who are the zombies and who

2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:07.040
 aren't, I just got no idea. If I just look at the history of human civilization, the difference

2:05:07.040 --> 2:05:14.640
 between a zombie and non zombie is the zombie accepts their role as the zombie and willingly

2:05:14.640 --> 2:05:23.760
 marches to slaughter. And the moment you stop being a zombie is when you say no, is when you

2:05:23.760 --> 2:05:32.880
 resist because the reality is philosophically is we can't know who's a zombie or not. And we just

2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:39.840
 keep letting everybody in who protests loudly enough. It says, I refuse to be slaughtered.

2:05:40.720 --> 2:05:47.600
 Like my people, the zombies have been slaughtered too long. We will not stand against the man.

2:05:47.600 --> 2:05:55.120
 And we need a revolution. That's the history of human civilization. One group says, we're

2:05:55.120 --> 2:05:59.680
 awesome. You're the zombies, you must die. And then eventually the zombies say, nope,

2:06:00.480 --> 2:06:06.960
 we're done with this. This is immoral. And so I just, I think that's not a, sorry, that's not

2:06:06.960 --> 2:06:11.280
 a philosophical statement. That's sort of a practical statement of history is a feature

2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:20.400
 of non zombies defined empirically. They say we refuse to be called zombies any longer.

2:06:20.400 --> 2:06:25.600
 We could end up with a zombie proletariat. If we can get these things that do all our manual labor

2:06:25.600 --> 2:06:32.000
 for us, they might start forming trade unions. I will lead you against these humans.

2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:38.320
 The zombie revolutionary leaders, the zombie Martin Luther King saying, I have a dream that

2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:43.920
 my zombie children will, but look, I mean, we need to sharply distinguish the ontological question.

2:06:43.920 --> 2:06:49.280
 I'm just pointing to the camera, talking to the, talking to my people, the zombies.

2:06:50.560 --> 2:06:55.280
 I mean, maybe that's, you know, maybe these illusionists, maybe they are zombies and the

2:06:55.280 --> 2:06:58.880
 rest of us are, maybe there's just a difference. But maybe you're the only non zombie.

2:06:58.880 --> 2:07:03.280
 Yeah, maybe that's, I often suspect that actually. I don't really, I don't have such

2:07:03.280 --> 2:07:08.320
 delusions of grandeur, at least I don't admit to them. But I just, we've got to distinguish

2:07:08.320 --> 2:07:13.040
 the ontological question from the epistemological question in terms of the reality of the situation.

2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:18.560
 You know, there must be, in my view, a factor that matters as to whether something's conscious

2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:23.680
 or not. And to me, it has rights if it's conscious, it doesn't if it's not. But then the epistemological

2:07:23.680 --> 2:07:29.760
 question, how the hell do we know it's a minefield, but we'll have to sort of try and cross that

2:07:29.760 --> 2:07:33.760
 bridge when we get to it, I think. Let me ask you a quick sort of a fun question,

2:07:33.760 --> 2:07:41.920
 assistant, fresh on your mind. You just yesterday had a conversation with Mr. Joe Rogan on his

2:07:41.920 --> 2:07:46.800
 podcast. What's your post mortem analysis of the chat? What are some interesting sticking

2:07:46.800 --> 2:07:51.840
 points, disagreements or joint insights? If we can kind of resolve them once you've had a chance

2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:57.680
 to sleep on it. And then I'll talk to Joe about it. Yeah, it was good fun. Yeah, he put up a bit

2:07:57.680 --> 2:08:06.560
 of a fight. Yeah, it was challenging. My view that we can't explain these things in conventional

2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:11.680
 scientific terms or whether they have already been explained in conventional scientific terms.

2:08:13.040 --> 2:08:20.240
 I suppose the point I was trying to press is we've got to distinguish the question of correlation

2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:28.800
 and explanation. Yes, we've established facts about correlation that certain kinds of brain

2:08:28.800 --> 2:08:37.120
 activity go along with certain kinds of experience. Everyone agrees on that. But that doesn't address

2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:43.120
 the why question. Why? Why do certain kinds of brain activity go along with certain kinds of

2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:47.520
 experience? And these different theories have different explanations of that. The

2:08:47.520 --> 2:08:55.440
 materialist tries to explain the experience in terms of the brain activity. The panpsychist

2:08:55.440 --> 2:09:00.800
 does it the other way around. The dualist thinks they're separate, but maybe they're tied together

2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:06.480
 by special laws of nature or something. Where's the sticking point? What exactly was the sticking

2:09:06.480 --> 2:09:14.000
 point? What's the nature of the argument? I suppose Joe was saying, well, look, we know

2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:22.640
 consciousness is explained by brain activity because you take some funny chemicals, it changes

2:09:22.640 --> 2:09:29.120
 your brain, it changes your consciousness. And I suppose, yeah, some people might want to press

2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:34.080
 and maybe this is what Joe was pressing. Isn't that explaining consciousness? But I suppose I

2:09:34.080 --> 2:09:41.360
 want to say there's a further question. Yes, changes of chemicals in my brain changes my

2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:47.520
 conscious experience. But that leaves open the question, why those particular chemicals go

2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:52.560
 along with that particular kind of experience rather than a different experience or no experience

2:09:52.560 --> 2:10:01.600
 at all? There's something deeper at the base layer is your view that is more important to try to

2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:06.720
 study and to understand in order to then go back and describe how the different chemicals interact

2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:12.320
 and create different experiences. Yeah, maybe a good analogy. If you think about quantum mechanics,

2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:19.920
 you know, quantum mechanics is a bit of math translating there. We say maths. I'm fluent

2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:29.840
 in American. Thank you for the translation. American is America. Math. Yeah. Why multiple

2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:38.320
 maths? It's plural. It's not really. It's just, I don't know. The Brits are confused. Yeah, sorry

2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:44.880
 about that. We have these funny spelling. But anyway. Yeah, so quantum mechanics is a bit of maths

2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:51.840
 and, you know, the equations work really well, predicts the outcomes. But then there's a further

2:10:51.840 --> 2:11:00.320
 question. What's going on in reality to make that equation predict correctly? And some of us just

2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:09.520
 want to say, shut up. Just it works. The shut up and calculate approach. Similarly, in consciousness,

2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:15.040
 you know, I think it's one question trying to work out the physical correlates of consciousness,

2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:18.960
 which kinds of physical brain activity go along, which kinds of experience. But there's another

2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:25.440
 question. What's going on in reality to undergird those correlations to make it the case that brain

2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:30.320
 activity goes along with experience? And that's the philosophical question that we have to give

2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:34.720
 an answer to. And there are just different options, just as there are different interpretations of

2:11:34.720 --> 2:11:40.400
 quantum mechanics. And it's really hard to evaluate. Actually, it's easy. Panpsychism is

2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:45.680
 obviously the best one. But we've got to try. There's the illusion of grandeur once again coming

2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:51.840
 through. Sorry, I'm being slightly tongue in cheek. No, I know. 100%. Before I forget, let me ask

2:11:51.840 --> 2:12:00.880
 you another fun question. Back to Daniel Dennett. You mentioned a story where you were on a yacht

2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:09.120
 with Daniel Dennett on a trip funded by a Russian investor and philosopher, Dmitry Volkov, I believe,

2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:13.760
 who also cofounded the Moscow Center of Consciousness Studies that's part of the Philosophy

2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:19.760
 Department of Moscow State University. So this is interesting to me for several reasons

2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:27.200
 that are perhaps complicated to explain, to put simply that there is in the near term for me a

2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:36.800
 trip to Russia that involves a few conversations in Russian that have perhaps less to do with

2:12:36.800 --> 2:12:40.960
 consciousness and artificial intelligence, which are the interests of mine, and more to do with

2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:49.120
 a broad spectrum of conversations. But I'm also interested in science in Russia, in artificial

2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:55.440
 intelligence and computer science, in physics, mathematics, but also these fascinating philosophical

2:12:55.440 --> 2:13:03.680
 explorations. And it was very pleasant for me to discover that such a center exists. So I have

2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:08.480
 a million questions. One is the more fun question just to imagine you and Daniel Dennett on a yacht

2:13:08.480 --> 2:13:14.880
 talking about the philosophy of consciousness. Maybe do you have any memorable experiences?

2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:20.880
 And also the more serious side for me as somebody who was born in the Soviet Union, raised there,

2:13:21.760 --> 2:13:29.280
 I'm wondering, what is the state of philosophy and consciousness and these kinds of ideas in

2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:33.600
 Russia that you've gotten a chance to kind of give us, interact with?

2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:40.240
 Yeah. So on the former question, yeah, I mean, I had a really, really good experience of chatting

2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:45.120
 to Daniel Dennett. I mean, I think he's a fantastic and very important philosopher, even though I

2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:50.640
 totally fundamentally disagree with almost everything he thinks. But yeah, it was a proud

2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:56.080
 moment. Well, as I talk about in my book Galileo's Error, I managed to persuade him he was wrong

2:13:56.080 --> 2:14:02.880
 about something, just a tiny thing, not his fundamental worldview. But it was this issue

2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:13.360
 about whether dualism is consistent with conservation of energy. So Paul Churchland,

2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:21.120
 who was also his philosopher, who's also on this boat, had argued, they're not consistent because

2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:26.400
 if there's an immaterial soul doing things in the brain, that's going to add to the energy in the

2:14:26.400 --> 2:14:31.920
 system. So we have a violation of conservation. But well, it's not my own point, philosophers,

2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:36.160
 materialist philosophers like David Papineau have pointed out that, you know,

2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:42.960
 people, dualists like David Chalmers, who call themselves naturalistic dualists,

2:14:42.960 --> 2:14:46.080
 they want to bring consciousness into science. They think it's not physical,

2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:53.200
 but they want to say it can be part of a law governed world. So Chalmers believes in these

2:14:54.000 --> 2:15:00.480
 psychophysical laws of nature over and above the laws of physics that govern the connections

2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:05.120
 between consciousness and the physical world. And they could just respect conservation of energy,

2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:10.560
 right? I mean, it could turn out that there are, just in physics, you know, that there are multiple

2:15:11.440 --> 2:15:15.040
 forces that all work together to respect conservation of energy. I mean, I suppose

2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:20.160
 physicists are pressing for a unified underlying theory, but you know, there could be a plurality

2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:26.800
 of different laws that all respect conservation. So why not add more laws? So I raised this in

2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:34.320
 Paul Churchland's talk. And I got a lot of, well, as one of the Moscow University graduate

2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:38.320
 students said afterwards, he said, he had to ask a translation from his friend. And he said,

2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:42.000
 I always say, they turned on you like a pack of wolves. Everyone was like,

2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:45.920
 Patricia Church was saying, so you believe in magic to you. And I was like, I'm not even a

2:15:45.920 --> 2:15:51.440
 dualist. I'm just making a pedantic point that this isn't a problem for dualism. Anyway,

2:15:51.440 --> 2:15:56.000
 but that evening, everyone went onto the island, except for some reason, me and Daniel Dennett.

2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:01.920
 And I went up on deck and he was, he's very, very practical and he was unlike me. See,

2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:06.400
 there's a bit of humility for the first time in this conversation. We'll highlight that part.

2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:14.000
 Philip was a very humble man. He was carving a walking stick on deck. It's very homely seen. And

2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:17.200
 anyway, we started talking about this and I was trying to press it and he was saying,

2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:20.560
 oh, but dualism is a lot of nonsense and why do you think, and I was just saying, no,

2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:25.120
 no, I'm just this honing down on this specific point. And in the end, maybe he'll deny this.

2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:29.040
 But he said, maybe that's right. And I was like, yes.

2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:36.400
 It's a win. So what about the Center for Consciousness Studies?

2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:41.280
 Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure I'd know a great deal to help you. I mean, I know they've done some

2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:47.440
 great stuff. Dimitri funded this thing and also brought it along some graduate students from

2:16:48.080 --> 2:16:52.880
 Moscow State University, I think it is. And they have an active center that

2:16:52.880 --> 2:16:59.520
 tries to bring people in. I think they're producing a book that's coming out that I

2:16:59.520 --> 2:17:04.800
 made a small contribution to on different philosophers opinions on God, I think,

2:17:04.800 --> 2:17:10.720
 or some of the big questions. And yeah, so there's some interesting stuff going on there.

2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:15.280
 I'm afraid I can't, I don't really know more generally about philosophy in Russia.

2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:23.280
 Dimitri Volkov seems to be interesting. I was looking at all the stuff he's involved with. He

2:17:23.280 --> 2:17:32.640
 met with the Dalai Lama. So he's trying to connect Russian scientists with the rest of the world,

2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:40.800
 which is an effort that I think is beautiful for all cultures. So I think science, philosophy,

2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:52.720
 all of these kind of fields, disciplines that explore ideas, collaborating and working globally

2:17:53.680 --> 2:18:00.400
 across boundaries, across borders, across just all the tensions of geopolitics is a beautiful

2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:07.120
 thing. And he seems to be a somewhat singular figure in pushing this up. He just stood out to

2:18:07.120 --> 2:18:11.040
 me as somebody who's super interesting. I don't know if you have gotten a chance to interact with

2:18:11.040 --> 2:18:19.200
 him. I guess he speaks English pretty well actually. So he's both an English speaker

2:18:19.200 --> 2:18:23.040
 and a Russian speaker. I think he's written a book on Dennett, I think called Boston Zombie,

2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:27.840
 I think. I think that's the title and he's a big fan of Dennett. So I think the original plan for

2:18:27.840 --> 2:18:31.840
 this was just going to be, it was on free will and consciousness and it was going to be kind of

2:18:31.840 --> 2:18:38.080
 people broadly in the Dennett type camp. But then I think they asked David Chalmers and then he was

2:18:38.080 --> 2:18:44.800
 saying, look, you need some people you disagree with. So he got invited, me the panpsychist and

2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:51.040
 Martina Niederumelen, who's a very good duelist, substance duelist, substance duelist at

2:18:52.080 --> 2:18:56.880
 University of Fleaborg in Switzerland. And so we were the official onboard opposition.

2:18:56.880 --> 2:19:04.240
 And you didn't get thrown off overboard. Nearly in the Arctic, yeah. So sailing

2:19:04.240 --> 2:19:08.400
 around the Arctic on a sailing ship. I'm glad you survived. You mentioned free will.

2:19:08.960 --> 2:19:12.560
 You haven't talked to Sam, I would love to hear that conversation actually.

2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:19.600
 With Sam Harris? With Sam Harris, yeah. So he talks about free will quite a bit. What's the

2:19:19.600 --> 2:19:26.320
 connection between free will and consciousness to you? So if consciousness permeates all matter,

2:19:27.840 --> 2:19:37.440
 the experience, the feeling like we make a choice in this world, like our actions or results of a

2:19:37.440 --> 2:19:47.520
 choice we consciously make to use that word loosely. What to you is the connection between

2:19:47.520 --> 2:19:56.000
 free will and consciousness and is free will an illusion or not? Good question. So I think we need

2:19:56.000 --> 2:20:04.560
 to be a lot more agnostic about free will than about consciousness, because I don't think we have

2:20:04.560 --> 2:20:09.040
 the kind of certainty of the existence of free will that we do have in the consciousness case.

2:20:09.040 --> 2:20:13.360
 It could turn out that free will is an illusion. It could be that it feels as though we're free

2:20:13.360 --> 2:20:19.920
 when we're really not. Whereas I think the idea that nobody really feels pain, that we think

2:20:19.920 --> 2:20:26.720
 we feel pain, but we do, that's a lot harder to make sense of. However, what I do feel strongly

2:20:26.720 --> 2:20:34.320
 about is I don't think there are any good either scientific or philosophical arguments against

2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:39.920
 the existence of free will. And I mean strong free will in what philosophers call libertarian

2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:45.680
 free will in the sense that some of our decisions are uncaused. So I very much do disagree with

2:20:45.680 --> 2:20:50.160
 someone like Sam Harris who thinks there's this overwhelming case. I just think it's

2:20:50.160 --> 2:20:56.800
 non existent. I think there's ultimately an empirical question, but as we've already discussed,

2:20:56.800 --> 2:21:04.720
 I just don't think we know enough about the brain to establish one way or the other at the moment.

2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:09.680
 But we can build up intuition. First of all, as a fan of Sam Harris, as a fan of yours,

2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:15.440
 I would love to just listen. Speaking about terminal. So one thing would be beautiful

2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:19.280
 to watch. Here's my prediction what happens with you and Sam Harris. You talk for four hours

2:21:21.280 --> 2:21:26.240
 and Sam introduced that episode by saying it was ultimately not as fruitful as I thought,

2:21:26.240 --> 2:21:30.640
 because here's what's going to happen. You guys are going to get stuck for the first three hours

2:21:30.640 --> 2:21:37.360
 talking about one of the terms and what they mean. Sam is so good at this. I think it's really

2:21:37.360 --> 2:21:45.600
 important, but sometimes you get stuck. What does he say? Put a pin in that. He really gets stuck on

2:21:45.600 --> 2:21:51.200
 the terminologies, which rightfully you have to get right in order to really understand what we're

2:21:51.200 --> 2:21:54.800
 talking about. But sometimes you can get stuck with them for the entire conversation. It's a

2:21:54.800 --> 2:22:02.800
 fascinating dance, the one we spoke to in philosophy. If you don't get the terms precise, you can't

2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:10.960
 really be having the same conversation. But at the same time, it could be argued that it's

2:22:10.960 --> 2:22:17.840
 impossible to get terms perfectly precise and perfectly formalized. So then you're also not

2:22:17.840 --> 2:22:23.280
 going to get anywhere in the conversation. So that's a funny dance where you have to be both

2:22:23.280 --> 2:22:29.760
 rigorous and every once in a while, just let go and then go back to being rigorous and formal and

2:22:29.760 --> 2:22:34.720
 then every once in a while let go. It's the difference between mathematics, the maths,

2:22:35.520 --> 2:22:44.960
 and the poetry. Anyway, yeah, I'm a big fan of Sam Harrison. I think we're on the same page in

2:22:44.960 --> 2:22:50.160
 terms of consciousness, I think, pretty much. I'm not saying he's a panpsychist, but in our

2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:57.120
 understanding of the hard problem. But yeah, I think maybe we could talk about free will without

2:22:57.120 --> 2:23:01.280
 being too dragged down in the terminology, but I don't know. You said we need to be open minded,

2:23:01.280 --> 2:23:10.240
 but you could still have intuitions about, so Sam Harris has a pretty sort of

2:23:11.040 --> 2:23:17.280
 cotter intuitive. And for some reason, it gets people really riled up, a view of free will

2:23:17.280 --> 2:23:26.000
 that it's an illusion, or it's not even an illusion. It's not that the experience of free will

2:23:26.800 --> 2:23:37.120
 is an illusion. He argues that we don't even experience. To say that we even have the experience

2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:44.000
 isn't correct, that there's not even an experience of free will. It's pretty interesting

2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:50.160
 that claim. And it feels like you can build up intuitions about what is right and not.

2:23:50.800 --> 2:23:54.800
 There's been some kind of neuroscience, there's been some cognitive science and

2:23:55.440 --> 2:24:04.400
 psychology experiments to see what is the timing and the origin of the

2:24:05.440 --> 2:24:09.520
 desire to make an action, and when that action is actually performed, and how you interpret that

2:24:09.520 --> 2:24:14.880
 action being performed, how you remember that action, all the stories we tell ourselves,

2:24:14.880 --> 2:24:19.600
 all the neurochemicals involved in making a thing happen, what's the timing,

2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:25.120
 and how does that connect with us feeling like we decided to do something. And then, of course,

2:24:25.120 --> 2:24:33.280
 there's the more philosophical discussion about, is there room in a material view of the world

2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:43.280
 for an entity that somehow disturbs the determinism of physics? Yeah. And yeah, those are all very

2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:50.160
 precise. It's nice. It feels like free will is more amenable to like a physics mechanistic type

2:24:50.160 --> 2:24:56.400
 of thinking than its consciousness to really get to the bottom of. It feels like if it was a race,

2:24:56.400 --> 2:25:01.440
 if we're at a bar and we're betting money, it feels like we'll get to the bottom of free will

2:25:01.440 --> 2:25:06.160
 faster than we will to the bottom of consciousness. Yeah, that's interesting. I hadn't thought about

2:25:06.160 --> 2:25:11.840
 the comparison. Yeah, so there are different arguments here. I mean, so one argument I've

2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:18.080
 heard Sam Harris give that's pretty common in philosophy is this sort of thought that we can't

2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:26.880
 make sense of a middle way between a choice being determined by prior causes and it just being

2:25:26.880 --> 2:25:33.200
 being totally random and senseless, like the random decay of radioactive isotope or something.

2:25:34.400 --> 2:25:40.640
 So I think there was a good answer to that by the philosopher Jonathan Low, who's not necessarily

2:25:40.640 --> 2:25:45.040
 very well known outside academic philosophy, but is a hugely influential figure. I think one of

2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:49.840
 the best philosophers of recent times. He sadly died of cancer a few years ago. He actually spent

2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:54.960
 almost all of his career at Durham University, which where I am. So it was one reason it was a

2:25:54.960 --> 2:26:00.320
 great honor to get to get a job there. But anyway, his answer to that was what makes the difference

2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:08.160
 between a free action and a totally senseless one, senseless random event, is that free choice

2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:16.080
 involves responsiveness to reasons. So again, we were talking about this earlier. If I'm deciding

2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:21.600
 whether to take a job in the US or to stay in the UK, I weigh up considerations, you know,

2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:27.600
 different standard of life, maybe, or being close to family or cultural difference, I weigh them up

2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:35.280
 and I, you know, edge towards a decision. So I think that is sufficient to distinguish it.

2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:42.080
 You know, we're hypothetically supposing trying to make sense of this idea, not saying it's real,

2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:48.640
 but that could be enough to distinguish it from a senseless. It's not a senseless random occurrence

2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:55.520
 because the free decision involved responsiveness to reasons. So I think that just answers that

2:26:55.520 --> 2:27:01.440
 particular philosophical objection. So what is the middle way between determined by prior causes and

2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:06.160
 totally random? Well, there's an action, a choice that's not determined by prior causes, but it's

2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:12.960
 not just random, because the decision essentially involved responsiveness to reasons. So that's

2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:19.200
 the answer to that. And I think actually that kind of thought also, I think you were hinting at the

2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:26.400
 famous Liberty experiments, where he got his subjects to perform some kind of random action

2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:32.080
 of pressing a button and then note the time they decided to press it quote unquote, and then he's

2:27:32.080 --> 2:27:38.880
 scanning the brains and he claims to have found that about half a second before they consciously

2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:45.440
 decided to press the button, the brain is getting ready to perform that action. So he claimed that

2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:51.200
 about half a second before the person has consciously decided to press the button, the brain has

2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:57.200
 already started the activity that's going to lead to the action. And then later people have

2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:03.200
 claimed that there's a difference of maybe seven to 10 seconds. I mean, there are all sorts of

2:28:03.200 --> 2:28:11.280
 issues with these experiments. But one is that as far as I'm aware, all of the quote unquote choices

2:28:11.280 --> 2:28:15.840
 they focused on are just these totally random, senseless actions, like just pressing a button

2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:21.040
 for no reason. And I think the kind of free will we're interested in is free choice that involves

2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:27.520
 responsiveness to reasons weighing up considerations. And those kind of free decisions might not happen

2:28:27.520 --> 2:28:32.640
 like at an identifiable instant. You might, when you're weighing it up, should I get married?

2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:40.400
 Should I, you know, you, you might edge slowly towards one side or the other. And so it could,

2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:45.120
 it could be that maybe the liberty, I think there are other problems with the liberty stuff, but

2:28:45.120 --> 2:28:51.520
 maybe they show that we can't freely choose to do something totally senseless, whatever that would

2:28:51.520 --> 2:29:00.000
 mean. But but that doesn't show we can't freely, in this strong libertarian sense, respond to

2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:06.240
 considerations of reason and value. To be fair, it will be difficult to see what kind of experiment

2:29:06.240 --> 2:29:13.680
 we could set up to test that. But just because we can't yet set up that kind of experiment,

2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:17.600
 we shouldn't, you know, pretend we know more than we do. So yeah, so for those reasons, I don't,

2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:22.960
 well, the third consideration you raise is different. Again, this is the debate I have

2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:28.000
 with Sean Carroll, would this conflict with physics? I just think we don't know enough about

2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:34.720
 the brain to know whether there are causal dynamics in the brain that are not reducible to underlying

2:29:35.680 --> 2:29:41.360
 chemistry and physics. And so, so then Sean Carroll says, well, that would mean

2:29:42.720 --> 2:29:49.120
 our physics is wrong. So he focuses on the core theory, which is the name for standard model

2:29:49.120 --> 2:29:55.440
 of particle physics plus the weak limit of general relativity. So, you know, we can't totally bring

2:29:55.440 --> 2:30:02.720
 quantum mechanics and relativity together. But actually, the circumstances in which we can't

2:30:02.720 --> 2:30:07.920
 bring them together are just in situations of very high gravity. For example, when you're

2:30:07.920 --> 2:30:13.520
 about to go into a black hole or something, actually in terrestrial circumstances, we can bring them

2:30:13.520 --> 2:30:19.280
 together in the core theory. And then Sean wants to say, well, we can be very confident that core

2:30:19.280 --> 2:30:26.480
 theory is correct. And so, if there were libertarian free will in the brain, the core theory would be

2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:32.240
 wrong. And okay, this I mean, this is something I'm not sure about. And I'm still thinking about

2:30:32.240 --> 2:30:36.880
 and I'm having I'm learning from my discussion with Sean, but I'm still not totally clear why

2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:42.400
 it could be suppose we did discover strong emergence in the brain, whether it's free will

2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:47.280
 or something else. Perhaps what we would say is not that the core theory is wrong, but we'd say

2:30:47.280 --> 2:30:57.200
 the core theory is correct in its own terms, namely capturing the causal capacities of

2:30:58.560 --> 2:31:03.280
 particles and fields. But then it's a further assumption, whether they're the only things

2:31:03.280 --> 2:31:08.720
 that are running the show. Maybe there are also fundamental causal capacities associated with

2:31:09.360 --> 2:31:14.080
 systems. And then if we discover this strong emergence, then when we work out what happens

2:31:14.080 --> 2:31:19.040
 in the brain, we have to look to the core theory, the causal capacities of particles and fields.

2:31:19.920 --> 2:31:24.480
 And we have to look to what we know about the strongly emergent causal capacities of systems,

2:31:24.480 --> 2:31:30.960
 and maybe they co determine what happens in the system. So I don't know whether that makes sense

2:31:30.960 --> 2:31:34.960
 or not. But I mean, the more important point, I mean, that's in a way a kind of branding point,

2:31:34.960 --> 2:31:38.960
 how we brand this, the more important point is we just don't know enough about the workings of the

2:31:38.960 --> 2:31:47.520
 brain to know whether there are strongly emergent causal dynamics, whether or not that would mean

2:31:47.520 --> 2:31:52.640
 we have to modify physics, or maybe just we think physics is not the total story of what's running

2:31:52.640 --> 2:32:00.080
 the show. But we just, if it turned out empirically that everything's reducible to underlying

2:32:00.080 --> 2:32:06.000
 physics and chemistry, sure, I would drop any commitment to free libertarian free will in a

2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:11.440
 heartbeat. It's an empirical question. Maybe that's why, as you say, in principle, it's easier to get

2:32:11.440 --> 2:32:15.680
 a grip on. But we're a million miles away from being at that stage. Well, I don't know for a

2:32:15.680 --> 2:32:21.040
 million miles. I hope we're not because one of the ways I think to get to it is by engineering

2:32:21.040 --> 2:32:27.840
 systems. So my hope is to understand intelligence by building intelligence systems, to understand

2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:34.800
 consciousness by building systems that, let's say the easy thing, which is not the easy thing,

2:32:34.800 --> 2:32:42.720
 but the first thing, which is to try to create the illusion of consciousness. Through that process,

2:32:42.720 --> 2:32:46.880
 I think you start to understand much more about consciousness, about intelligence,

2:32:46.880 --> 2:32:50.640
 and then the same with free will. I think those are all tied very closely together,

2:32:51.360 --> 2:32:57.360
 at least from our narrow human perspective. And we try to engineer systems that interact deeply

2:32:57.360 --> 2:33:03.200
 with humans, that form friends with humans that humans fall in love with, and they fall in love

2:33:03.200 --> 2:33:11.760
 with humans. Then you start to have to try to deeply understand ourselves, to try to deeply

2:33:11.760 --> 2:33:16.800
 understand what is intelligence in the human mind, what is consciousness, what is free will.

2:33:17.360 --> 2:33:21.920
 And I think engineering is just another way to do philosophy.

2:33:22.960 --> 2:33:27.600
 Yeah. No, I certainly think there's a role for that. And it would be an important consideration

2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:42.080
 if we could seemingly replicate in an artificial way the ability to choose that would be our

2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:46.560
 consideration in thinking about these things. But there's still the question of whether

2:33:46.560 --> 2:33:52.400
 that's how we do it. So even if we could replicate behavior in a certain way in

2:33:52.400 --> 2:33:56.720
 an artificial system, it's not until we understand the workings of our brains,

2:33:56.720 --> 2:34:02.320
 it's not clear, that's how we do it. And as I say, the kind of free will I'm interested in is

2:34:02.320 --> 2:34:11.040
 where we respond to reasons, considerations of value, how would we tell whether a system was

2:34:11.040 --> 2:34:19.440
 genuinely grasping and responding to facts about value or whether they were just

2:34:19.440 --> 2:34:29.520
 replicating, giving the impression of doing so. I don't know even how to think about that.

2:34:29.520 --> 2:34:34.400
 On the process to building them, I think we'll get a lot of insights. And once they become

2:34:35.600 --> 2:34:40.640
 conscious, what's going to happen is exactly the same thing that's happening in chess now,

2:34:40.640 --> 2:34:49.760
 which is once the chess engines far superseded the capabilities of humans, humans just kind of

2:34:49.760 --> 2:34:54.640
 forgot about them, or they used them to help them out with the study and stuff. But we say,

2:34:54.640 --> 2:34:58.240
 okay, let the engines be, and then we humans will just play amongst each other.

2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:06.320
 Just like dolphins and hamsters are not so concerned about humans except for a source of food,

2:35:06.320 --> 2:35:12.800
 they do their own thing and let us humans launch rockets into space and all that kind of stuff,

2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:18.880
 they don't care. I think we'll just focus on ourselves. But in the process of building

2:35:18.880 --> 2:35:24.160
 intelligence systems, conscious systems, I think we'll get a deeper understanding of

2:35:27.040 --> 2:35:33.280
 the role of consciousness in the human mind. And what are its origins? Is it the base layer of

2:35:33.280 --> 2:35:41.280
 reality? Is it strongly merge a phenomena of the brain? Or just as you sort of brilliantly put here,

2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:44.400
 it could be both, like they're not mutually exclusive.

2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:50.160
 Dealing with consciousness needs to be an interdisciplinary task. We need philosophers,

2:35:50.880 --> 2:35:57.840
 neuroscientists, physicists, engineers, replicating these things artificially and

2:35:57.840 --> 2:36:05.600
 all needs to be working in step. I'm quite interested. More and more scientists get

2:36:05.600 --> 2:36:10.560
 in touch with me, actually, saying that was one of the great things about, I think,

2:36:10.560 --> 2:36:15.280
 that's come from writing a popular book is not just getting the ideas out to a general audience,

2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:18.160
 but getting the ideas out to scientists and scientists getting touched saying,

2:36:18.160 --> 2:36:23.360
 no, this in some way connects to my work. And I would like to kind of start to put together

2:36:23.360 --> 2:36:29.360
 a network of an interdisciplinary network of scientists and philosophers and engineers,

2:36:29.360 --> 2:36:35.600
 perhaps interested in a panpsychist approach. And because I think so far,

2:36:35.600 --> 2:36:39.920
 panpsychism has just been sort of trying to justify its existence. And that's important.

2:36:39.920 --> 2:36:45.120
 But I think once you just get on with an active research program, that's when people start taking

2:36:45.120 --> 2:36:50.160
 it seriously, I think. Do you think we're living in a simulation?

2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:54.640
 No, I think...

2:36:56.480 --> 2:37:01.200
 Is there some aspect to that thought experiment that's compelling to you within the framework of

2:37:02.160 --> 2:37:02.880
 panpsychism?

2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:11.680
 It's an important and serious argument. And it's not to be laughed away. I suppose one issue I

2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:19.040
 have with it is there's a crucial assumption there that consciousness is substrate independent

2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:27.360
 as the jargon goes, which means it's software rather than hardware. It's depend on

2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:32.480
 organization rather than the stuff. Whereas as a panpsychist, I think consciousness is the stuff

2:37:32.480 --> 2:37:38.560
 of the brain. It's the stuff of matter. So I think just taking the organizational properties,

2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:43.760
 the software in my brain and uploading them, you wouldn't get the stuff of my brain. So I

2:37:43.760 --> 2:37:49.920
 am actually worried if at some point in the future we start uploading our minds and we think, oh my

2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:55.840
 God, Granny's still there. I can email Granny after her body's rotted in the ground. And we

2:37:55.840 --> 2:38:01.120
 all start uploading our brains. It could be we're just committing suicide. We're just getting rid of

2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:09.120
 our consciousness because I think that wouldn't, for me, preserve the experience, just getting

2:38:09.120 --> 2:38:16.240
 them what the software features. Anyway, that's a crucial premise of this simulation argument

2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:21.520
 because the idea in a simulated universe, I don't think he necessarily would have consciousness.

2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:26.560
 It's interesting that you as a panpsychist are attached because to me,

2:38:29.520 --> 2:38:35.520
 panpsychism would encourage the thought that there's not a significant difference.

2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:45.760
 And at the very bottom, it's not substrate independent, but you're going to have consciousness

2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:51.280
 in a human and then move it to something else. You can move it to the cloud. You can move it

2:38:51.280 --> 2:38:57.440
 to the computer. It feels like that's much more possible if consciousness is the base layer.

2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:06.160
 Yes, you could certainly, it allows for the possibility of creating artificial consciousness

2:39:06.160 --> 2:39:11.600
 because there's not souls. There aren't any kind of extra magical ingredients. So yeah,

2:39:11.600 --> 2:39:16.800
 it's definitely allows the possibility of artificial consciousness and maybe preserving

2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:23.760
 my consciousness in some sort of artificial way. My only point, I suppose, was just replicating

2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:30.400
 the computational or organizational features would not, for me, preserve consciousness.

2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:35.040
 I mean, but some opponents of materialism disagree with me on that. I think David

2:39:35.040 --> 2:39:38.800
 Chalmers is an opponent of materialist. He's a kind of dualist, but he thinks

2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:46.800
 the way these psychophysical laws work, they hook onto the computational or organizational

2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:51.040
 features of matter. So he thinks, you know, I think he thinks you could upload your consciousness.

2:39:51.040 --> 2:39:58.320
 I tend to think not. So in that sense, we're not living in simulation

2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:05.760
 in the sort of specific computational view of things in that substrate matters to you.

2:40:05.760 --> 2:40:10.800
 Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. And in that, you agree, Sean Carroll, that physics matters.

2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:19.520
 Yeah, physics is our best way of capturing what the stuff of the world does.

2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:25.680
 Yeah. But not the whatness, the being of the stuff. Yeah, the isness.

2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:30.000
 The isness, thank you. Russell Brand, I had a conversation with Russell Brand,

2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:33.520
 and he said, oh, you mean the isness? I thought it was a good way of putting this.

2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:40.320
 The isness. The isness. Russell's great. The big ridiculous question. What do you think is the

2:40:40.320 --> 2:40:48.960
 meaning of all of this? You write in your book that the entry for our reality in the Hitchhiker's

2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:56.240
 Guide might read a physical universe whose intrinsic nature is constituted of consciousness

2:40:57.280 --> 2:41:05.600
 worth a visit. So our whole conversation has been about the first part of that sentence.

2:41:06.160 --> 2:41:13.440
 What about the second part worth a visit? Why is this place worth a visit? Why does it have meaning?

2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:23.120
 Why does it have value at all? Why? These are big questions. I mean, firstly,

2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:29.520
 I do think panpsychism is important to think about for considerations of

2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:36.880
 meaning and value. As we've already discussed, I think consciousness is the root of everything

2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:45.520
 that matters in life from deep emotions, subtle thoughts, beautiful sensory experiences.

2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:53.200
 And yet, I believe our official scientific worldview is incompatible with the reality of

2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:58.240
 consciousness. I mean, that's controversial, but that's what I think. And I think people

2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:03.600
 feel this on an intuitive level. It's maybe part of what Max Weber called the disenchantment of

2:42:03.600 --> 2:42:12.480
 nature. They know their feelings and experiences are not just electrochemical signaling. I mean,

2:42:12.480 --> 2:42:16.960
 they might just have that very informed intuition, but I think that can be rigorously supported.

2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:24.080
 So I think this can lead to a sense of alienation and a sense that we lack a framework for

2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:28.960
 understanding the meaning and significance of our lives. And in the absence of that,

2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:33.600
 people turn to other things to make sense of the meaning of their lives, like nationalism,

2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:39.040
 fundamentalist religion, consumerism. So I think panpsychism is important in that regard,

2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:45.680
 in bringing together the quantitative facts of physical science with, as it were, the human

2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:53.440
 truth, by which I just mean the qualitative reality of our own experience. As I've already

2:42:53.440 --> 2:43:02.240
 said, I do think there are objective facts about value and what we ought to do and what we ought

2:43:02.240 --> 2:43:07.440
 to believe that we respond to. And that's very mysterious to make sense of, both how there

2:43:07.440 --> 2:43:13.680
 could be such facts and how we could know about them and respond to them. But I do think there

2:43:13.680 --> 2:43:17.680
 are such facts and they're mostly to do with kinds of conscious experience.

2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:25.440
 So they're there to be discovered and much of the human condition is to discover those

2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:27.760
 objective sources of value?

2:43:27.760 --> 2:43:32.400
 I think so, yeah. And then, I mean, moving away from panpsychism to the, you know,

2:43:33.840 --> 2:43:38.480
 at an even bigger level, I suppose I think it is important to me

2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:45.680
 to live in hope that there's a purpose to existence and that, you know, what I do

2:43:45.680 --> 2:43:54.320
 contributes in some small way to that greater purpose. But, you know, I would say I don't

2:43:54.320 --> 2:43:58.160
 know if there's a purpose to existence. I think some things point in that direction,

2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:04.720
 some things point away from it. But I don't think you need certainty or even high probability

2:44:05.600 --> 2:44:11.680
 to have faith in something. So take an analogy. Suppose you've got a friend who's very seriously

2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:17.520
 ill, maybe there's a 30% chance they're going to make it. You shouldn't believe your friend's

2:44:17.520 --> 2:44:22.320
 going to get better, you know, because they're probably not. But what you can say is, you know,

2:44:22.320 --> 2:44:26.960
 you can say to your friend, I have faith that you're going to get better. That is, I choose to

2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:33.840
 live in hope about that, about that possibility. I choose to orientate my life towards that hope.

2:44:34.640 --> 2:44:38.880
 Similarly, you know, I don't think we know whether or not there's a purpose to existence,

2:44:38.880 --> 2:44:46.000
 but I think we can make the choice to live in hope of that possibility. And I find that

2:44:47.840 --> 2:44:54.000
 a worthwhile and fulfilling way to live. So maybe as your editor, I would

2:44:55.280 --> 2:45:01.760
 collaborate with you on the edit of the hitchhiker's guide entry that instead of worth a visit,

2:45:01.760 --> 2:45:11.920
 it will insert hopefully worth a visit or the inhabitants hoped that you would think

2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:18.240
 it's worth a visit. Philip, you're an incredible mind, an incredible human being, and indeed are

2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:26.640
 humble. And I'm really happy that you're able to argue and take on some of these difficult questions

2:45:26.640 --> 2:45:31.760
 with some of the most brilliant people in the world, which are the philosophers thinking about

2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:37.200
 the human mind. So this was an awesome conversation. I hope you continue talking to folks like Sam

2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:42.960
 Harris. I'm so glad you talked to Joe. I can't wait to see what you write, what you say, what

2:45:42.960 --> 2:45:46.880
 you think next. Thank you so much for talking today. Thanks very much, Lex. This has been a

2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:50.960
 really fascinating conversation. I've got a lot I need to think about, actually, just from this

2:45:50.960 --> 2:45:55.920
 conversation. But thanks for chatting to me. Thanks for listening to this conversation with

2:45:55.920 --> 2:46:01.360
 Philip Goff. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,

2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:08.000
 let me leave you some words from Carl Jung. People will do anything, no matter how absurd,

2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:13.760
 in order to avoid facing their own souls. One does not become enlightened by imagining

2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:20.960
 figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. Thank you for listening and hope to see you

2:46:20.960 --> 2:46:29.920
 next time.
