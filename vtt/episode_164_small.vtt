00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
 The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman, his second

00:03.240 --> 00:06.640
 time in the podcast. He's a neuroscientist at Stanford, a

00:06.640 --> 00:10.080
 world class researcher and educator. And now he has a new

00:10.080 --> 00:14.520
 podcast on YouTube, and all the usual places called Huberman

00:14.520 --> 00:19.280
 Lab, that I can't recommend highly enough. Quick mention of our

00:19.280 --> 00:23.480
 sponsors, masterclass online courses for systematic mushroom

00:23.480 --> 00:27.880
 coffee, magic spoon low carb cereal, and better help online

00:27.880 --> 00:32.280
 therapy, click the sponsor links to get a discount. By the way,

00:32.320 --> 00:35.320
 masterclass is testing to see if they want to support this

00:35.320 --> 00:39.400
 podcast long term. So if you're on the fence, now is the time to

00:39.400 --> 00:42.800
 sign up. And I'm pretty sure Andrew will have a neuroscience

00:42.800 --> 00:45.760
 masterclass on there soon enough, though his podcast is

00:45.760 --> 00:50.080
 basically a weekly masterclass in itself. As a side note, let me

00:50.080 --> 00:54.360
 say that Andrew is a friend and a new collaborator. We're working

00:54.400 --> 00:57.760
 on a paper together about a topic we're both really passionate

00:57.760 --> 01:00.520
 about. At the intersection of neuroscience and machine

01:00.520 --> 01:03.480
 learning. But that's probably many months away from being

01:03.480 --> 01:07.000
 published. Still, I'm really excited about this work. He's

01:07.000 --> 01:09.480
 one of the smartest and kindest people I have the pleasure of

01:09.480 --> 01:12.960
 talking to on this podcast. So I hope we'll talk many more

01:12.960 --> 01:15.920
 times in the future. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on

01:22.760 --> 01:28.560
 Friedman. And now here's my conversation with Andrew Huberman. Why

01:28.560 --> 01:33.160
 do humans need sleep? Let's go with a big first question.

01:33.440 --> 01:37.720
 Okay, well, the answer I'll start with is the one that I always

01:37.720 --> 01:43.080
 default to when there's a why question. I wasn't consulted at

01:43.120 --> 01:48.400
 the design phase. So, so, so I wriggle my way out of giving a

01:48.400 --> 01:54.120
 absolute answer, right? But there's one mechanism that's very

01:54.120 --> 01:57.960
 clear. That's super important, which is that the longer we are

01:57.960 --> 02:04.280
 awake, the more adenosine accumulates in our brain. And

02:04.280 --> 02:08.400
 adenosine binds to adenosine receptors. No surprise there.

02:08.520 --> 02:14.400
 And it creates the feeling of sleepiness, independent of time

02:14.400 --> 02:18.400
 of day or night. So there are two mechanisms. One is we get

02:18.400 --> 02:23.200
 sleepy. As adenosine accumulates, the longer we've been awake,

02:23.200 --> 02:28.720
 the more adenosine is accumulated in our system. But how sleepy we

02:28.720 --> 02:32.320
 get for a given amount of adenosine depends on where we

02:32.320 --> 02:35.880
 are in this so called circadian cycle. And the circadian cycle

02:35.880 --> 02:39.560
 is just this very, very well conserved oscillation. It's a

02:39.560 --> 02:42.640
 temperature oscillation, where you go from a low point,

02:42.640 --> 02:44.880
 typically, if you're awake during the day and you're asleep at

02:44.880 --> 02:50.440
 night, your lowest temperature point will be like 3am, 4am,

02:50.480 --> 02:52.960
 and then your temperature will start to creep up as you wake

02:52.960 --> 02:56.040
 up in the morning, and then it'll peak in the late afternoon,

02:56.200 --> 02:58.360
 and then it'll start to drop again toward the evening, and

02:58.360 --> 03:01.640
 then you get sleep again. That oscillation in temperature

03:01.640 --> 03:08.480
 takes 24 hours, plus or minus an hour. And I don't even though

03:08.480 --> 03:11.680
 I wasn't consulted at the design phase, I do not think it's a

03:11.680 --> 03:16.200
 coincidence that it's aligned to the 24 hour spin of the earth on

03:16.200 --> 03:20.400
 its axis, and the fact that we tend to be bathed in sunlight for

03:20.400 --> 03:23.800
 a portion of that spin, and in darkness for the other portion

03:23.800 --> 03:25.680
 of that spin. So there are two mechanisms, the adenosine

03:25.680 --> 03:29.280
 accumulation and the circadian time point that we happen to be

03:29.280 --> 03:33.160
 at. And those converge to create a sense of sleepiness,

03:33.160 --> 03:37.040
 awakefulness. The simple way to reveal these two mechanisms to

03:37.040 --> 03:41.040
 uncouple them is stay up for 24 hours, and you will find that

03:41.040 --> 03:43.960
 even though you've been, let's say you stay up midnight, two

03:43.960 --> 03:48.800
 AM, three AM, provided you're on a regular schedule, like that I

03:48.800 --> 03:52.560
 follow, not like the kind that you follow, you get, I will get

03:52.560 --> 03:57.560
 very sleepy around three, four AM. But then around five or six

03:57.560 --> 04:00.160
 or seven AM, which is my normal wake up time, I'll start to

04:00.160 --> 04:04.400
 feel more alert, even though adenosine has been accumulating

04:05.160 --> 04:08.880
 further. So adenosine is higher for me the longer I stay up,

04:08.880 --> 04:11.080
 and yet I feel more alert than I did a few hours ago. And

04:11.080 --> 04:14.280
 that's because these are two interacting forces. So adenosine

04:14.280 --> 04:17.240
 makes you sleepy. And then just how sleepy or how awake you

04:17.240 --> 04:19.680
 feel also depends on where you are in this temperature

04:19.680 --> 04:21.160
 oscillation that takes 24 hours.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.520
 Okay, so that's fascinating. So there's a bunch of

04:23.520 --> 04:27.000
 oscillations going on. And then it kind of through the

04:27.000 --> 04:29.640
 evolutionary process have evolved to all be aligned

04:29.640 --> 04:33.360
 somewhat, and they interplay. So you said your body

04:33.360 --> 04:38.400
 temperature goes up and down. Those chemicals in your brain

04:38.400 --> 04:42.160
 that oscillate. And then there's the actual oscillation of

04:42.160 --> 04:50.880
 the, the sun in the in the sky. So all of that together has

04:50.880 --> 04:55.040
 some impact on each other. And somehow that all results in us

04:55.040 --> 04:56.800
 wanting to go to sleep every night.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.960
 Right. So, and we can get right into the meat of this. I

04:59.960 --> 05:04.480
 guess we just dove right in. But the, so that the temperature

05:04.480 --> 05:08.520
 oscillation is the effector of the circadian clock. So every cell

05:08.520 --> 05:12.200
 in our body has a 24 hour rhythm that's dictated by genes

05:12.200 --> 05:15.800
 like clock per BMAL. This is one of the great successes of

05:15.800 --> 05:18.560
 biology. They give a Nobel Prize to the repert and I don't

05:18.560 --> 05:21.040
 know if repert got it, forgive me. But sorry, if you got it,

05:21.040 --> 05:23.680
 Steve, congratulations. If you didn't, I'm sorry, I wasn't on

05:23.680 --> 05:26.960
 the committee. Nonetheless, did beautiful work Steve repert

05:26.960 --> 05:31.520
 and others. But Mike Roshbosh and like other people worked out

05:31.520 --> 05:34.120
 these mechanisms and flies and bacteria and mammals, there are

05:34.120 --> 05:37.960
 these genes that create 24 hour oscillations in gene expression,

05:37.960 --> 05:42.360
 et cetera, in every cell of our body. But what aligns those is

05:42.360 --> 05:44.720
 a signal from the master circadian clock, which sits

05:44.720 --> 05:46.960
 right above the roof of the mouth called the super charismatic

05:46.960 --> 05:51.720
 nucleus. And that clock synchronizes all the clocks of

05:51.720 --> 05:56.480
 the body to this general temperature rhythm by way of

05:56.480 --> 05:59.520
 controlling systemic temperature, which makes perfect

05:59.520 --> 06:02.400
 sense. If you want to create a general oscillation in all the

06:02.400 --> 06:06.320
 tissues and organs of the body, use temperature. And so that

06:06.320 --> 06:09.200
 work on temperature, if you want to explore it further was Joe

06:09.200 --> 06:13.120
 Takahashi, who was at Northwestern now at UT Southwestern

06:13.120 --> 06:18.160
 in Dallas. And it is absolutely clear that humans do better on

06:18.160 --> 06:21.920
 a diurnal schedule, sorry, Lex, than a nocturnal schedule,

06:21.920 --> 06:25.840
 because you could say, well, provided I sleep and push a

06:25.840 --> 06:28.320
 denticing back downhill, which is what happens when we sleep,

06:28.320 --> 06:31.920
 a denticing that is then reduced, and provided I am on more

06:31.920 --> 06:34.800
 or less a 24 hour schedule, why should it matter that I'm awake

06:34.800 --> 06:38.440
 when the sun's out? And, and I'm asleep when the sun is down.

06:38.600 --> 06:42.120
 But it turns out that if you look at health metrics, people

06:42.120 --> 06:47.520
 that are strictly nocturnal, do far worse on immune function or

06:47.520 --> 06:50.680
 metabolic function, et cetera, than people who are diurnal who

06:50.680 --> 06:53.400
 are awake during the daytime. And animals that are nocturnal,

06:53.560 --> 06:56.600
 it's the opposite. And animals that are so called corpuscular,

06:56.600 --> 07:00.440
 which tend to be active at dawn and at dusk. This is a beautiful

07:00.440 --> 07:02.480
 system. I won't go down that rabbit hole. But these are

07:02.480 --> 07:05.800
 animals whose visual systems operate best. They tend to be

07:05.800 --> 07:08.920
 predators like mountain lions. They have optimized their

07:08.920 --> 07:13.400
 waking times for the times when the animals they eat can't see

07:13.400 --> 07:17.080
 well in those light conditions. But given the rod cone ratios in

07:17.080 --> 07:20.440
 their eyes, that the mountain line is picking off. It's like,

07:20.640 --> 07:23.480
 when you see special forces, and they are looking through night

07:23.480 --> 07:26.920
 vision goggles, and they have a clear advantage, right? They're

07:26.920 --> 07:29.520
 seeing in the dark. That's basically what it's like to be

07:29.520 --> 07:32.400
 a mountain lion, as opposed to a bunny rabbit.

07:32.800 --> 07:37.040
 Would you say that a lot of these cycles evolved in the predator

07:37.040 --> 07:39.600
 prey relationships of the different throughout the food

07:39.600 --> 07:43.520
 chain? So it's basically all somehow has to do with survival in

07:44.520 --> 07:46.800
 this complicated web of predators and prey?

07:46.920 --> 07:50.200
 Almost certainly. There had to have been a time in which humans

07:50.200 --> 07:53.920
 being awake and active at night, as opposed to during the day,

07:53.920 --> 07:59.240
 led to higher levels of lethality, and probably particular in

07:59.240 --> 08:01.400
 kids. Can you imagine kids running around in the dark and

08:01.400 --> 08:03.640
 getting where there are a lot of animals that can see really

08:03.640 --> 08:06.520
 well under those conditions, and humans can't. And this would

08:06.520 --> 08:09.680
 be all pre electricity. Even if you're carrying a torch, I mean,

08:09.680 --> 08:13.240
 the range of illumination on a torch is nothing compared to

08:13.240 --> 08:18.720
 what a nighttime predator like a large cat or something can do.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.920
 They basically, they can see everything they need to in order

08:20.920 --> 08:23.280
 to eat us and not the other way around.

08:23.280 --> 08:29.240
 So one fascinating thing you said is that blew my mind and

08:29.240 --> 08:34.120
 we went right past it, which is that temperature is a really

08:34.120 --> 08:37.800
 powerful, like, if you were to think about the ways that

08:37.800 --> 08:40.520
 different parts of the body, different systems in the body

08:40.520 --> 08:44.600
 would communicate with each other, temperature would be a

08:44.600 --> 08:48.720
 really good one. And that just, I mean, maybe it's obvious, but

08:48.720 --> 08:54.160
 it kind of blew my mind just now that, yeah, these systems are

08:54.160 --> 08:58.360
 all distributed, right? And they have to kind of, they're not

08:58.360 --> 09:01.200
 actually sending signals, but they're coordinating, they need

09:01.200 --> 09:06.640
 some sort of universal thing to look at in order to coordinate.

09:06.920 --> 09:11.280
 And temperature is a nice one to, to, to build around. And that

09:11.280 --> 09:14.960
 way, you could control the behavior of all these different

09:14.960 --> 09:18.440
 systems by controlling the temperature, right? If it's

09:18.440 --> 09:21.440
 attractive to think of a mechanism where this master

09:21.440 --> 09:24.200
 circadian clocks, it creates a peptide or something that goes

09:24.200 --> 09:27.120
 and locks to receptors in all the cells and gets it just right.

09:27.320 --> 09:30.400
 But that leaves far too much room for variability, binding

09:30.400 --> 09:33.920
 affinities, cells in a lot of parts of our body are at

09:33.920 --> 09:36.760
 different stages of maturation, they're turning over liver

09:36.760 --> 09:39.800
 cells and so forth. And for instance, we have a clock in

09:39.800 --> 09:43.480
 our gut and in our liver, such that if we were just take out

09:43.480 --> 09:46.240
 your liver and put it on a table, and just look at the

09:46.240 --> 09:48.400
 expression of these genes, it would be in a 24 hour

09:48.400 --> 09:51.120
 oscillation on its own, it's independent. But something has

09:51.120 --> 09:54.280
 to entrain them and keep them all synchronized. And so it's not

09:54.280 --> 09:56.840
 obvious that it would be temperature. Takahashi's great

09:56.840 --> 10:01.280
 gift to biology was to show that all the stuff coming out of

10:01.280 --> 10:05.200
 this master circadian clock, at the end of the day, that's a

10:05.200 --> 10:08.200
 weird statement, no pun intended, at the end of the day and

10:08.200 --> 10:12.360
 the night, at the, at the end of the story, it all boils down to

10:12.480 --> 10:14.720
 making sure that the temperature of tissues

10:14.720 --> 10:16.440
 oscillates in the same fashion.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.760
 That's blowing my mind and thinking like what other

10:19.760 --> 10:22.640
 mechanism could possibly exist to create that kind of

10:22.640 --> 10:23.360
 oscillation.

10:23.720 --> 10:27.320
 Well, in your, your Russian, it's cold in Russia for a lot of

10:27.320 --> 10:29.960
 the year, the hibernation signal in certain animals is a

10:29.960 --> 10:32.640
 remarkable signal. There are peptides secreted from this

10:32.640 --> 10:36.640
 very same clock, that in animals like ground squirrels or

10:36.640 --> 10:40.600
 bears, they go into a kind of a torpor where everything

10:40.600 --> 10:43.360
 reproduction, metabolism, everything is reduced while

10:43.360 --> 10:45.960
 they're in their cave, they don't actually stay asleep all of

10:45.960 --> 10:49.320
 winter, that's a myth. And they actually do these very

10:50.200 --> 10:53.760
 dramatic and periodic arousals from hibernation where they

10:53.760 --> 10:55.840
 just shake and shake and shake, it looks like a seizure, and

10:55.840 --> 10:59.040
 then they go back under into the torpor. That's from a peptide

10:59.040 --> 11:01.760
 that's released. But that's different because that's about

11:01.760 --> 11:04.960
 shutting down the whole system. It's clear that having these

11:04.960 --> 11:08.840
 very regular oscillations every 24 hours is essential for

11:08.880 --> 11:11.600
 everything from metabolism to reproduction.

11:11.600 --> 11:17.240
 Is there an optimal temperature for sleep that I should

11:17.240 --> 11:22.560
 mention? I think your latest episode, you and people should

11:22.560 --> 11:27.520
 go check out helixsleep.com slash huberman to support Andrew.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.000
 Thanks for the plug.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.720
 I mean, the amazing thing about that stuff they created and

11:33.720 --> 11:36.680
 oh, and yes, you have a new podcast that's amazing. And

11:36.680 --> 11:40.520
 this past month, he did a whole series on sleep, which is

11:40.520 --> 11:46.520
 definitely check out. There's some podcasts that come out that

11:46.520 --> 11:50.760
 just make me want to be a better human being by just the

11:50.760 --> 11:55.280
 quality. Three blue one brown, Grant Sanderson is like that for

11:55.280 --> 12:00.120
 me, just like, wow, this is education is best. So Andrew

12:00.640 --> 12:05.000
 symbolizes that captures that brilliantly. So go support the

12:05.000 --> 12:08.720
 sponsor so he doesn't stop doing the thing. So they I think

12:08.720 --> 12:13.160
 they have a cooling pad too. So I ate sleep mattress sponsors

12:13.160 --> 12:18.440
 me. They've been they sent me a mattress and it's been I've

12:18.440 --> 12:22.800
 never listened. I used to sleep on the floor sleep or you fall

12:22.800 --> 12:26.200
 sleep or I fall I don't give a shit. It doesn't doesn't really

12:26.200 --> 12:30.240
 matter. But so like I would have never bought a nice mattress

12:30.840 --> 12:35.680
 because it's like why I'm fine. This is a floor is fine. But it

12:35.680 --> 12:39.880
 was a game changer to be able to control temperature. Like for

12:39.880 --> 12:43.600
 me, it's cooling to cool. I don't know what the hell it is.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.560
 Well, you want the brain and nervous system and rest of the

12:46.560 --> 12:49.200
 body needs to drop by about anywhere from two to three

12:49.200 --> 12:51.800
 degrees in order to get into your deepest sleep and

12:51.800 --> 12:54.440
 transition to sleep. That's really going to help. You don't

12:54.440 --> 12:57.680
 want to be cold that you're bothered and can't fall asleep.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.000
 But that's why some people like it really cold in the room and

13:00.000 --> 13:03.840
 under a warm blanket or with socks on for some people that can

13:03.840 --> 13:07.520
 that can be good because this temperature oscillation is such

13:07.520 --> 13:10.920
 that as your temperature is dropping, that correlates with

13:10.920 --> 13:14.800
 the generally with the most sleepy phase of your circadian

13:14.800 --> 13:18.560
 cycle. So cool is better for falling and staying asleep and

13:18.560 --> 13:21.760
 sleeping deeply. And then I guess like that's what AIDS

13:21.760 --> 13:26.760
 sleep showed there like an app is it warms back up to wake you

13:26.760 --> 13:29.760
 up. The idea that I haven't actually used it like this is

13:29.760 --> 13:34.640
 stupid. People say it works, but I just keep it the same

13:34.640 --> 13:39.600
 temperature throughout the night. But warming it up, I guess

13:39.600 --> 13:42.640
 wakes you up, which is which is fascinating. Yeah, because

13:42.640 --> 13:45.920
 you're the wake up signal is it's interesting to think about

13:45.920 --> 13:48.560
 it's not just correlated with an increase in body temperature.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.360
 The increase in body temperature is triggering the

13:51.360 --> 13:54.160
 release of cortisol from your adrenals and that's the wake

13:54.160 --> 13:56.560
 up signal. Do you think it's absolute temperatures we're

13:56.560 --> 13:59.840
 talking about is just even relative? Just even just the

13:59.840 --> 14:02.240
 decrease? Well, everyone's going to have slightly different

14:02.240 --> 14:05.600
 basal temperature. The idea that everybody should be 98.6. I

14:05.600 --> 14:08.800
 mean, that's a myth. And there's a theories that body

14:08.800 --> 14:11.440
 temperature overall has been dropping in the last 50 years

14:11.440 --> 14:14.560
 or so. I doubt that's true for somebody who is athletic like

14:14.560 --> 14:19.680
 you and is, you know, young and healthy. But basically the

14:19.680 --> 14:23.200
 the coldest period of that 24 hour cycle is when you are

14:23.200 --> 14:25.920
 going to be sleepiest. There's actually a period within that

14:25.920 --> 14:28.640
 24 hour cycle. It's a it's a time point called your

14:28.640 --> 14:31.520
 temperature minimum. And your temperature minimum tends to

14:31.520 --> 14:36.240
 be about two hours before your typical wake up time. I'm not

14:36.240 --> 14:37.680
 talking about the wake up time in the middle of the night

14:37.680 --> 14:39.840
 where you go use the bathroom or where you set an alarm to go

14:39.840 --> 14:42.160
 catch a flight. I mean, if you were to just allow yourself to

14:42.160 --> 14:45.200
 sleep without a clock for a few days, measure when you

14:45.200 --> 14:47.680
 typically wake up two hours before then is your temperature

14:47.680 --> 14:50.720
 minimum. And that temperature minimum turns out to be a

14:50.720 --> 14:56.160
 very important landmark in your circadian cycle because it

14:56.160 --> 15:01.520
 turns out that if you get bright light in your eyes in the

15:01.520 --> 15:07.040
 hours immediately before your temperature minimum. So two to

15:07.040 --> 15:09.760
 four hours or any time within the two or four hour window

15:09.760 --> 15:11.920
 before that temperature minimum, you are going to what's

15:11.920 --> 15:15.760
 called delay your circadian clock the next day that whole

15:15.760 --> 15:18.640
 oscillation is going to move forward. It'll make you want to

15:18.640 --> 15:21.680
 go to sleep later and wake up later. Whereas if you get

15:21.680 --> 15:25.280
 bright lighting your eyes in the hours after that temperature

15:25.280 --> 15:28.320
 minimum. So let's say for me, typical wake up time is six

15:28.320 --> 15:30.880
 a.m. my temperature minimum somewhere around four a.m. If

15:30.880 --> 15:34.480
 I get bright light in my eyes, five a.m. six a.m. seven a.m.

15:34.480 --> 15:38.240
 It's going to advance that oscillation so that I'll want to

15:38.240 --> 15:41.680
 go to bed earlier and wake up earlier the subsequent nights.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.800
 So you might say, wait, but most nights I go to sleep and

15:44.800 --> 15:47.280
 wake up at more or less the same time. Why is that? And

15:47.280 --> 15:50.080
 that's because the same thing is happening on both sides. You

15:50.080 --> 15:53.680
 are both advancing your clock a little bit and assuming that

15:53.680 --> 15:56.240
 you're looking at light in the evening, you're also delaying

15:56.240 --> 15:58.240
 your clock a little bit so you get kind of captured in

15:58.240 --> 16:01.760
 between and then your rhythm more or less oscillates at the

16:01.760 --> 16:05.200
 same period as we say is the spin of the earth. Unless

16:05.200 --> 16:08.160
 you're like you where you're I get text messages from you

16:08.160 --> 16:12.000
 sometimes that odd hours and I if you're on the east coast,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.720
 then I know that you had to have been pulling basically an

16:14.720 --> 16:19.920
 all night. Yeah. That's the interesting point about the

16:19.920 --> 16:24.000
 messiness of sleep. So most people seem to perform the

16:24.000 --> 16:28.080
 best when they have like a regular sleep schedule.

16:28.080 --> 16:33.200
 I perhaps am the same, but I don't know that and I tend to

16:33.200 --> 16:38.000
 believe that you can also perform relatively optimally

16:38.000 --> 16:46.720
 with chaos of sleep of like a weird soup of like power

16:46.720 --> 16:52.320
 naps and all nighters and all of that as long as you're

16:52.320 --> 17:00.560
 like happy doing what you love and maybe you can

17:00.560 --> 17:04.080
 tell me what you think about this. So I tend to for myself

17:04.080 --> 17:09.760
 try to minimize stress in life. So what I found for myself

17:09.760 --> 17:14.080
 with diet with sleep is that if I obsess about it being

17:14.080 --> 17:17.600
 perfect, then I'll actually stress quite a bit when it's

17:17.600 --> 17:24.560
 not like I'll feel shitty when I don't get enough sleep

17:24.560 --> 17:28.480
 because I know I should be getting more sleep as opposed to

17:28.480 --> 17:32.080
 the actual physiological effects of not getting enough sleep.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.520
 I find if I just accept whatever the hell happens happens

17:35.520 --> 17:41.040
 and smile and just take it all in like David Goggins style,

17:41.040 --> 17:45.120
 like if it sucks, it's even better or what is it?

17:45.120 --> 17:48.640
 Jocko's like good or whatever he says. Right. I think

17:48.640 --> 17:50.960
 there's several things that you said that are important,

17:50.960 --> 17:55.680
 but I agree that one can have a dysregulated sleep schedule

17:55.680 --> 17:58.800
 and still be a happy person and productive. Much of my

17:58.800 --> 18:03.120
 life I've pulled all nighters and slept weird schedules.

18:03.120 --> 18:06.400
 I think many people can probably relate to going to sleep,

18:06.400 --> 18:08.960
 waking up four hours later, being up for an hour or two on your

18:08.960 --> 18:10.880
 computer, then going back to sleep and getting amazing

18:10.880 --> 18:15.520
 sleep the next day functioning. I think it's important

18:15.520 --> 18:18.800
 that people have highlighted the importance of sleep

18:18.800 --> 18:22.800
 and getting enough rest. I do think it's gone too far

18:22.800 --> 18:26.000
 and now I'm editorializing a little bit, but I think that

18:26.000 --> 18:29.280
 we've created this anxiety about sleep that if we don't

18:29.280 --> 18:31.200
 sleep enough, we're going to get dementia. If we don't get

18:31.200 --> 18:37.440
 sleep, then the reproductive axis is going to completely crash.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.560
 There's a lot of evidence to the contrary and as well,

18:40.560 --> 18:43.840
 just based on personal experience and based on the fact that

18:43.840 --> 18:48.560
 sure, it may be that a solid eight hours with no interruptions

18:48.560 --> 18:52.560
 in there or nine or 10 could do great benefit, but you can do

18:52.560 --> 18:56.000
 really well if you do what you say, which is you wake up, you

18:56.000 --> 18:58.240
 don't want to start stressing about it, creating this meta

18:58.240 --> 19:03.040
 stress about sleep. Being happy is actually one of the most

19:03.040 --> 19:05.840
 powerful things that you can do, not allowing yourself to go

19:05.840 --> 19:09.920
 down that rabbit hole of stress. For the following reason,

19:09.920 --> 19:13.280
 a lot of our fatigue is not due just to the buildup of a

19:13.280 --> 19:15.920
 denocene or time of day, the circadian thing we were talking

19:15.920 --> 19:20.960
 about earlier. An additional factor is that effort is

19:20.960 --> 19:23.280
 related to the release of epinephrine, of adrenaline in

19:23.280 --> 19:28.720
 our brain and body. At some point, those levels get so high

19:28.720 --> 19:33.440
 that we get stressed mentally, we get stressed physically and

19:33.440 --> 19:36.160
 we want to give up. There are good data published in cell

19:36.160 --> 19:39.120
 showing that that signal, the epinephrine signal, is

19:39.120 --> 19:42.800
 eventually accumulates and there's a quit point. Dopamine,

19:42.800 --> 19:47.040
 the molecule of pursuit and reward and feeling good,

19:47.040 --> 19:51.680
 resets our ability to be in effort. In fact, a lot of people

19:51.680 --> 19:55.680
 don't know this, but dopamine is actually what epinephrine is

19:55.680 --> 19:58.560
 made from. If you look at the biochemical cascade, it starts

19:58.560 --> 20:02.320
 with tyrosine, which is rich in red, found in red meats and

20:02.320 --> 20:04.560
 things of that sort, and tyrosine is eventually

20:04.560 --> 20:08.240
 converted through things like Ldopa into dopamine. Dopamine is

20:08.240 --> 20:11.760
 made into epinephrine. I mean, this sounds kind of new agey,

20:11.760 --> 20:16.080
 but happiness, joy, and pleasure in what you're doing

20:16.080 --> 20:21.040
 creates a chemical milieu that provides more of the chemicals

20:21.040 --> 20:24.160
 that allow for effort. There's nothing new agey about that.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.800
 It's in every biochemistry textbook. It's in every decent

20:26.800 --> 20:28.800
 neuroscience textbook. They just don't talk about the

20:28.800 --> 20:31.600
 happiness part. They just talk about the dopamine part. I

20:31.600 --> 20:34.800
 think that limiting your stress and at least recognizing,

20:34.800 --> 20:37.280
 okay, if you're pulling an all nighter or you're somehow

20:37.280 --> 20:42.080
 on messed up sleep, that there is going to be a point in that

20:42.080 --> 20:46.400
 24 hour cycle where your brain is not trustworthy, where your

20:46.400 --> 20:50.880
 mental state is not worth placing too much weight on

20:50.880 --> 20:53.680
 because you are near that temperature minimum and near

20:53.680 --> 20:56.320
 that temperature minimum, which correlates to that two

20:56.320 --> 21:00.320
 hours, about two hours before you would normally wake up,

21:00.320 --> 21:05.760
 the brain is hobbling along and anything you feel or think at

21:05.760 --> 21:10.160
 that time should not be given too much value. But if you can

21:10.160 --> 21:13.360
 trick yourself into thinking that's the pleasure point, you

21:13.360 --> 21:16.160
 afford yourself a huge advantage. There's a study done by a

21:16.160 --> 21:19.440
 colleague of mine at Stanford that showed that positive

21:19.440 --> 21:25.360
 anticipation about the next day events actually is a powerful

21:25.360 --> 21:30.560
 metric for creating quality sleep even if the sleep is very

21:30.560 --> 21:35.360
 reduced. You'll love this one and a lot of people might be

21:35.360 --> 21:37.440
 critical of this, so I just want to make sure that this is

21:37.440 --> 21:42.160
 work done out of Harvard Medical. It was Bob Stickgold's

21:42.160 --> 21:46.240
 lab and Emily Hoglund did the study that showed looking at

21:46.240 --> 21:49.760
 Ochem, performance on Ochem scores. Okay, so organic chemistry

21:49.760 --> 21:53.200
 Harvard's pretty tough subject, highly motivated, a number of

21:53.200 --> 21:56.800
 very good control groups in this study. What she showed was

21:56.800 --> 22:00.880
 that consistency of total sleep duration was far more

22:00.880 --> 22:05.040
 important for performance on these exams than total sleep

22:05.040 --> 22:08.640
 duration itself. So it's not that just getting more sleep

22:08.640 --> 22:12.080
 allows you to perform better. Consistently getting about the

22:12.080 --> 22:16.480
 same amount of sleep is better for performance at least on

22:16.480 --> 22:21.200
 Ochem than just getting more. That's interesting. So that's

22:21.200 --> 22:25.360
 referring to more that there should be a consistent habit

22:25.360 --> 22:29.920
 versus the total amount. To me, the entirety of the picture of

22:29.920 --> 22:38.320
 sleep is similar to nutrition in that it feels like it's

22:38.320 --> 22:40.960
 there's so many variables involved and it's so person

22:40.960 --> 22:44.960
 specific. So, you know, a lot of studies, I mean, this is the

22:44.960 --> 22:48.960
 way of science, has to look and aggregate the effects on

22:48.960 --> 22:52.800
 sleep. It doesn't focus on high performers, which are

22:52.800 --> 22:58.240
 individuals ultimately. Like the question isn't, so it's a

22:58.240 --> 23:01.360
 very important question is like, what kind of diet fights

23:01.360 --> 23:06.000
 obesity, reduces obesity? It's another question, what kind of

23:06.000 --> 23:09.200
 diet allows David Goggins to be the best version of himself?

23:09.200 --> 23:12.320
 So these high performers in different avenues and the same

23:12.320 --> 23:16.320
 thing with sleep, like people that tell me that I should get

23:16.320 --> 23:23.840
 eight hours of sleep, it's like, it's, I mean, I get it and

23:23.840 --> 23:26.640
 they may be right, but they may be very wrong. There's no

23:26.640 --> 23:31.200
 evidence that eight is better than six, that you could very

23:31.200 --> 23:34.080
 well do better on six than on eight. There are a few other

23:34.080 --> 23:37.760
 things that turn out to be strong parameters for success in

23:37.760 --> 23:41.760
 this domain. For instance, your entire life, waking or

23:41.760 --> 23:44.640
 asleep, is broken up into these 90 minute ultradian cycles.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.760
 If you look at ability to attend or do math problems or do

23:47.760 --> 23:52.320
 anything, you know, drive, performance tends to ramp up

23:52.320 --> 23:55.440
 slowly within a 90 minute cycle peak and then come down at

23:55.440 --> 23:58.400
 the end of that 90 minute cycle. And in sleep, we go

23:58.400 --> 24:01.280
 through these stage one, two, three, four, REM, etc. We

24:01.280 --> 24:03.440
 talked more about that, if you like, those on 90 minute

24:03.440 --> 24:07.040
 ultradian cycles as well. Ending your sleep after a 90

24:07.040 --> 24:10.960
 minute cycle at the near the end of a 90 minute cycle, say at

24:10.960 --> 24:15.200
 the end of six hours, in many cases is better for you than

24:15.200 --> 24:17.680
 sleeping an additional hour, seven hours and waking up in

24:17.680 --> 24:19.920
 the middle of an ultradian cycle. And there are a few

24:19.920 --> 24:22.480
 apps that can measure this based on body movements and

24:22.480 --> 24:26.080
 things like that that have you, your alarm go off at the end

24:26.080 --> 24:29.200
 of an ultradian cycle. And if you wake up in the middle of

24:29.200 --> 24:32.080
 an ultradian cycle, sometimes not always, you can be very

24:32.080 --> 24:35.280
 groggy for a long period of time. I certainly do better on

24:35.280 --> 24:39.120
 six hours than I do on seven. I happen to like an eight hour

24:39.120 --> 24:42.640
 sleep. It feels great, but I haven't slept an entire eight

24:42.640 --> 24:44.720
 hours without waking up in the middle of the night at some

24:44.720 --> 24:49.200
 point in, I don't know, forever. I can't remember. It's

24:49.200 --> 24:52.560
 probably some point in infancy, but and I function well

24:52.560 --> 24:56.240
 during the day. I think that that's a big, that's an

24:56.240 --> 24:59.120
 important parameter is how do you feel during the day? Almost

24:59.120 --> 25:02.320
 everybody experiences some sort of dip in energy in the late

25:02.320 --> 25:04.320
 afternoon or what would correlate to their temperature

25:04.320 --> 25:08.720
 peak. And that's a good time of day to get either a 90

25:08.720 --> 25:13.120
 minute or less nap. Or if you're not a napper or you can't

25:13.120 --> 25:18.720
 nap, feet elevated has been shown to be good for clear

25:18.720 --> 25:22.160
 out of some of this. The glimphatic system is this

25:22.160 --> 25:24.000
 kind of like sewer system of the brain that you can clear

25:24.000 --> 25:28.400
 stuff out. So legs elevated or one thing that I'm a big

25:28.400 --> 25:30.880
 proponent of and that my lab has been studying is what I

25:30.880 --> 25:35.360
 now call NSDR, non sleep deep rest. And this is just lying

25:35.360 --> 25:37.920
 down. There are some scripts that we're going to put out

25:37.920 --> 25:40.800
 there soon as a free resource. There's some hypnosis

25:40.800 --> 25:42.800
 scripts that my colleague David Spiegel has put out there as

25:42.800 --> 25:46.160
 a free resource. But non sleep deep rest is allowing your

25:46.160 --> 25:50.320
 system to drop into states of real calm that allow you to

25:50.320 --> 25:53.120
 get better at falling asleep later. And they can be very

25:53.120 --> 25:55.760
 restorative for cognitive and motor function. There's at

25:55.760 --> 26:00.800
 least one study out of Denmark that shows that the basal

26:00.800 --> 26:02.800
 ganglia, which is an area of the brain that's involved in

26:02.800 --> 26:06.000
 motor planning and action, one of these 20 minute non sleep

26:06.000 --> 26:09.280
 deep rest protocols resets levels of neuromodulators like

26:09.280 --> 26:12.720
 dopamine in the basal ganglia to the same levels that they

26:12.720 --> 26:17.440
 were right after a long night's sleep. So I also

26:17.440 --> 26:20.560
 respectfully or semi respectfully disagree with the

26:20.560 --> 26:23.920
 idea that you can't recover lost sleep. What does that mean?

26:23.920 --> 26:27.440
 I mean that there's no IRS for sleep. So what does it mean

26:27.440 --> 26:30.400
 to be in debt for sleep? If you're falling asleep during

26:30.400 --> 26:32.880
 the day and you're sleepy, like you're falling asleep,

26:32.880 --> 26:36.000
 that's a good sign of insomnia means you're not sleeping

26:36.000 --> 26:38.640
 enough at night. If you're fatigued during the day,

26:38.640 --> 26:41.200
 but you're not falling asleep, so you're just exhausted,

26:41.200 --> 26:42.960
 but you're not finding yourself falling asleep in

26:42.960 --> 26:46.800
 meetings and in conversation, then chances are you're

26:46.800 --> 26:50.720
 fatiguing your system through something else like a long

26:50.720 --> 26:53.040
 run in the middle of the night at Boston or whatever it is

26:53.040 --> 26:57.120
 that you're up to lately at 3 a.m. Yes. There is a magic to

26:57.120 --> 27:01.520
 the nap and maybe you could speak to the because you

27:01.520 --> 27:05.280
 mentioned these protocols that don't necessarily, so

27:05.280 --> 27:14.000
 they're non sleep, but to me the nap one or two a day can

27:14.000 --> 27:16.960
 almost irrespective of how much sleep I get the night

27:16.960 --> 27:21.440
 before have a fundamental change in my mood and my

27:21.440 --> 27:23.920
 performance for the better for the better for the better.

27:23.920 --> 27:28.880
 Yeah, likewise. So I do tend to kind of experiment with

27:28.880 --> 27:33.520
 durations. It's it's consistently surprising to me

27:33.520 --> 27:37.120
 how like a nap of like 10 minutes, I don't know, maybe you

27:37.120 --> 27:41.200
 can speak to the perfect duration of a nap, but I find

27:41.200 --> 27:46.720
 that it's like magic that a short nap does as much good

27:46.720 --> 27:50.080
 and often better than a longer one for me, for me

27:50.080 --> 27:52.640
 subjective. What would be a longer one? Longer than 90

27:52.640 --> 27:55.680
 minutes? No, no, like 90 minutes or but longer than

27:55.680 --> 27:58.480
 90, like two hours. Yeah, that's dropping you starting to

27:58.480 --> 28:01.280
 drop you into REM sleep and even if it's a tiny amount of

28:01.280 --> 28:03.360
 REM sleep, people can come out of those naps kind of

28:03.360 --> 28:06.080
 disoriented. Right. I mean, remember in sleep space and

28:06.080 --> 28:10.640
 time are are totally uncoupled and so they that's an odd

28:10.640 --> 28:13.280
 state to reenter the world in if you're not going to stay

28:13.280 --> 28:16.240
 there for a while like for a good night's sleep. I think a

28:16.240 --> 28:19.280
 20 minute nap is pretty fantastic. Would you say

28:19.280 --> 28:22.000
 that's the if you were to recommend to the general and

28:22.000 --> 28:24.960
 it's it's very weird to recommend anything to the

28:24.960 --> 28:27.760
 general populace because obviously it's very person

28:27.760 --> 28:31.360
 specific, but what's a good one where you say to friends

28:31.360 --> 28:34.800
 is 20 minutes, 20 or 30 minutes, 20 or 30 minutes

28:34.800 --> 28:37.280
 because you're going unless you're sleep deprived,

28:37.280 --> 28:40.800
 you're going to stay out of REM sleep, rapid eye movement

28:40.800 --> 28:42.720
 sleep. If you're sleep deprived, you'll drop right

28:42.720 --> 28:44.400
 into it. If you've ever traveled and you're really

28:44.400 --> 28:46.400
 jet lagged, you go to the hotel, you lay down for

28:46.400 --> 28:49.280
 one second, all of a sudden you're just like you're

28:49.280 --> 28:53.360
 you're in a psychedelic dream, which can be pretty

28:53.360 --> 28:59.200
 great too. But I think that 20, 30 minutes and if you

28:59.200 --> 29:02.080
 can't sleep, some people have trouble napping, then

29:02.080 --> 29:04.880
 learning to relax the body as much as possible like

29:04.880 --> 29:07.200
 trying to remove all expression from your face

29:07.200 --> 29:10.560
 completely letting your body kind of float. If people

29:10.560 --> 29:13.520
 have a hard time relaxing when they're awake, there's

29:13.520 --> 29:17.280
 some terrific clinically and research tested hypnosis

29:17.280 --> 29:20.400
 protocols that we could provide links to that are

29:20.400 --> 29:24.560
 cost free and that teach you how to just completely

29:24.560 --> 29:27.520
 release the alertness button and you just start

29:27.520 --> 29:30.640
 drifting. Now, the problem is if you don't have an

29:30.640 --> 29:33.360
 alarm or something to go off, the other day I did

29:33.360 --> 29:35.760
 one and I'm almost embarrassed to say this, but

29:35.760 --> 29:37.040
 there's a component of it where you actually are

29:37.040 --> 29:39.280
 supposed to let your hand float up because it's a

29:39.280 --> 29:42.240
 hypnosis script. So they, it's my colleague, David

29:42.240 --> 29:45.600
 Spiegel in the script. He says, let your hand float

29:45.600 --> 29:48.000
 up. I woke up an hour later and my hand was still

29:48.000 --> 29:50.720
 floating. Wow. Yeah. And I was and I was completely

29:50.720 --> 29:55.600
 relaxed. So hypnosis is just a matter of going

29:55.600 --> 29:58.800
 deep relaxation, narrowing of context. And it's all

29:58.800 --> 30:00.880
 self imposed. A lot of people think that hypnosis is

30:00.880 --> 30:03.040
 like the stage thing with the pendant and the

30:03.040 --> 30:05.680
 chicken, you know, people fucking like chickens.

30:05.680 --> 30:09.200
 But real hypnosis is self hypnosis. You're learning

30:09.200 --> 30:12.400
 to, it involves some shifts in the way that you,

30:12.400 --> 30:15.360
 the hypnotic induction involves looking up, closing

30:15.360 --> 30:17.840
 your eyes, slowly deep breath and then imagine

30:17.840 --> 30:21.920
 yourself floating and people vary on a scale of

30:21.920 --> 30:24.480
 about one to four for being the most easily

30:24.480 --> 30:26.800
 hypnotized. There are a few people who it's very

30:26.800 --> 30:29.200
 hard for them to allow themselves to go into

30:29.200 --> 30:31.920
 these states. But for most people, they just,

30:31.920 --> 30:35.440
 they're gone. And it's nice if you can have access

30:35.440 --> 30:37.840
 to those states because when you come out of it,

30:37.840 --> 30:40.400
 you feel amazing. You feel like you slept the whole

30:40.400 --> 30:42.640
 night. At least most people report that. So

30:42.640 --> 30:45.440
 refresh alert. Ready to go. I mean, basically,

30:45.440 --> 30:48.000
 you're ready. Yeah, I know you have this

30:48.000 --> 30:50.160
 interesting challenge coming up and I'm curious

30:50.160 --> 30:52.800
 what you're going to do to reset in the hours.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.840
 The frequency of running is every four hours. It's

30:55.840 --> 30:58.000
 not going to allow you to get any more than

30:58.000 --> 30:59.680
 a couple hours sleep in between. A couple hours. So

30:59.680 --> 31:02.240
 we should tell to people, I'd be curious to get

31:02.240 --> 31:06.000
 your thoughts and advice on it. I'm on March 5th

31:06.880 --> 31:10.880
 running 48 miles with Mr. David Goggins. So four

31:10.880 --> 31:14.720
 miles every four hours and people should join us.

31:14.720 --> 31:17.680
 He's that mad man that's going to be live on

31:17.680 --> 31:22.560
 Instagram starting at 8 p.m. Pacific on March 5th.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.040
 So you're going to join him in person?

31:25.040 --> 31:28.800
 In person. Undisclosed location. Undisclosed location.

31:28.800 --> 31:31.280
 And I was trying to clarify, like, okay, so we're

31:31.280 --> 31:35.280
 going to, like, there'll be like friendly people

31:35.280 --> 31:37.360
 around or something. No, it's just me and him.

31:37.360 --> 31:40.720
 Friendly people. I don't know. Like, I just feel

31:40.720 --> 31:44.800
 it's very difficult to be with David alone in a room.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.600
 I imagine his, I mean, I've done some work with David.

31:47.600 --> 31:51.760
 His energy is infectious. That's an intense schedule.

31:52.880 --> 31:56.560
 And the periodicity of those four hours, every four

31:56.560 --> 31:58.960
 hours, four miles, means that there's no chance

31:58.960 --> 32:01.600
 of catching an extended block of sleep.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.000
 So it's about three hours that you have

32:04.000 --> 32:08.400
 non exercising every time. And of course, it takes

32:08.400 --> 32:10.720
 time to try to fall asleep and there's an intensity

32:10.720 --> 32:15.200
 to the whole thing. I mean, it's probably impossible

32:15.200 --> 32:18.640
 to get anything more than two hours of sleep

32:18.640 --> 32:21.920
 if you wanted to. So the optimal thing is probably

32:21.920 --> 32:24.480
 from the sound of it. I'd be curious to see what

32:24.480 --> 32:28.480
 you think. But like, it's getting a few 90 minute naps.

32:28.480 --> 32:32.000
 Yeah. Well, I thought about this a bit before we

32:32.000 --> 32:35.680
 met up today. So I think there are two general approaches

32:35.680 --> 32:39.360
 that could work. Neither one necessarily better than the other.

32:39.360 --> 32:44.080
 One would be just to hammer through the whole thing,

32:44.080 --> 32:46.640
 just to get your level of alertness and adrenaline

32:47.360 --> 32:50.800
 ramped up so that you don't expect yourself to sleep.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.160
 There are certain advantages there. One is a subjective

32:54.160 --> 32:56.640
 kind of emotional advantage, which is if you can't sleep,

32:56.640 --> 32:58.000
 you're not going to be stressed about that.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.800
 Yes. And if you do fall asleep, it's a bonus.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.800
 Yeah. Provided you wake up and you don't look up

33:02.800 --> 33:05.360
 and you realize David's been out running for half an hour

33:05.360 --> 33:08.160
 and you're behind, right? Chances are that's not the way

33:08.160 --> 33:09.840
 that's not the way it'll go. You're set an alarm.

33:09.840 --> 33:15.360
 So that's one approach. And I grabbed that from a couple of

33:15.360 --> 33:18.800
 friends who were in the SEAL teams and they'll say that

33:18.800 --> 33:20.880
 during Bud's, there's this infamous Hell Week and there's

33:20.880 --> 33:24.640
 this five day, excuse me, definitely five days of no

33:24.640 --> 33:27.280
 sleep, although there is a component where they offer a nap

33:27.280 --> 33:32.000
 at one particular point. And a lot of people will say that

33:32.000 --> 33:35.760
 it's worse to go down for that nap and then be woken up 20

33:35.760 --> 33:39.520
 minutes later than to just stay up. So that's one option.

33:39.520 --> 33:43.280
 Let's call it the full blitz hammer through option.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.200
 And if you happen to fall asleep, you do.

33:45.200 --> 33:48.080
 Bonus, yeah. It's a bonus. The other one would be to

33:48.080 --> 33:51.760
 really anchor in these ultradian cycles. So coming back

33:51.760 --> 33:55.440
 from a run, unless you're thoroughly exhausted, you're

33:55.440 --> 33:57.600
 probably going to have a few minutes where you're going

33:57.600 --> 33:59.440
 to want to stay awake. It's going to be hard to just

33:59.440 --> 34:03.600
 immediately fall asleep and getting as much sleep as you

34:03.600 --> 34:06.880
 can in the intervening periods provided that you guys

34:06.880 --> 34:09.520
 aren't posting constantly or doing something else.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.680
 There's a question of whether or not you want to nourish,

34:11.680 --> 34:14.400
 whether or not you want to eat or not in that time.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.760
 Anytime we put food in our gut, I don't care if it's meat

34:17.760 --> 34:23.600
 or oatmeal or broccoli or cardboard, you're drawing blood

34:23.600 --> 34:27.120
 into the gut and so you are going to divert some energy

34:27.120 --> 34:29.200
 towards digestion and it's going to make you sleep.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.680
 There's a reason why the rest and digest, the parasympathetic

34:31.680 --> 34:35.760
 nervous system is called that. So you could decide that you

34:35.760 --> 34:38.240
 were only going to sleep in certain blocks, in between

34:38.240 --> 34:40.960
 certain blocks. That would be another way to think about

34:40.960 --> 34:47.520
 this. Because I did this last year. I ran very slow. Some of

34:47.520 --> 34:49.840
 it was walking. I was listening to audiobooks and one of the

34:49.840 --> 34:54.080
 biggest mistakes I did is to overeat during that time.

34:54.080 --> 34:57.280
 It was, I made the experience very unpleasant. So I have

34:57.280 --> 35:00.480
 been considering basically eating almost nothing throughout

35:00.480 --> 35:04.000
 the day. Being fasted will increase alertness because

35:04.000 --> 35:06.880
 high levels of epinephrine in your system from fasting.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.920
 You just think about fasting or being thirsty before you

35:09.920 --> 35:11.680
 get exhausted. People always think, if I don't eat, I'm

35:11.680 --> 35:15.680
 going to be tired. No, the energy that you derive from food

35:15.680 --> 35:19.040
 is going to be used from glycogen and after a long

35:19.040 --> 35:22.000
 storage and conversion process. So the food that you eat is

35:22.000 --> 35:25.600
 going to consume energy to digest and so a lot of people

35:25.600 --> 35:29.200
 feel better fasted and presumably throughout history

35:29.200 --> 35:31.280
 people have fasted for long periods of time and had to

35:31.280 --> 35:34.960
 stay up for two or three days and God forbid if a family

35:34.960 --> 35:37.520
 member is sick, you can stay awake in the hospital without

35:37.520 --> 35:42.560
 any trouble. So that alertness system, it's all mental.

35:42.560 --> 35:45.840
 Actually, and then there's a third, so you could try and

35:45.840 --> 35:49.200
 sleep or take care in between. Yes. Yeah. And then there's a

35:49.200 --> 35:52.720
 third approach. Uh oh. Yeah. But I didn't come up with it.

35:52.720 --> 35:56.480
 What is it? What David did. So I actually texted him

35:56.480 --> 35:58.960
 earlier because I had a feeling that I heard that you

35:58.960 --> 36:05.440
 were going to do this challenge. So I asked David.

36:05.440 --> 36:09.520
 So these are David Goggins words, not mine. Okay.

36:09.520 --> 36:15.280
 One, being organized is super important. Two, you want to

36:15.280 --> 36:19.760
 waste as little time as possible. Three, you need to eat,

36:19.760 --> 36:23.280
 sleep, and rehab in as little time as possible so you can

36:23.280 --> 36:26.000
 sleep as much as possible. Interesting. By the way, this is

36:26.000 --> 36:30.720
 the first time I'm reading this. Four, meal prep and

36:30.720 --> 36:34.400
 gear prep, etc, are very important. That's consistent

36:34.400 --> 36:37.840
 with everything I know about military. They don't leave

36:37.840 --> 36:42.400
 too much to chance. Five, again, these are David's words.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.600
 All that said, he's fucked on most of that because he'll be

36:45.600 --> 36:48.160
 interviewing me before or after. I will also be

36:48.160 --> 36:53.040
 interviewing him. Oh, shit. Five, long story short, the

36:53.040 --> 36:56.080
 only thing that might help is a very special pill. Oh, this is

36:56.080 --> 37:00.960
 interesting. They're called SIU pills. Hard to get, but I

37:00.960 --> 37:06.320
 believe he can get them. SIU stands for suck it up. Tell him

37:06.320 --> 37:11.840
 to grab his balls. He'll find those pills there. That's

37:11.840 --> 37:15.120
 number six. All right. And then the last one, stay hard,

37:15.120 --> 37:19.360
 brother. Stay hard, brother. Amen. I, you know, that was one

37:19.360 --> 37:22.880
 of the other things that I think makes this challenging is

37:22.880 --> 37:26.720
 that it'll be doing a podcast throughout. So, first of all,

37:26.720 --> 37:31.280
 I'll do a long one before and after, but also I'll have to

37:31.280 --> 37:35.360
 come up with things to talk to him about. So, like, it's a

37:35.360 --> 37:40.560
 different thing to do something privately and then

37:40.560 --> 37:45.360
 publicly. I know it doesn't seem that way, but like one of

37:45.360 --> 37:49.760
 the hardest, the hardest thing I had to do last time was to

37:49.760 --> 37:53.680
 turn on the camera and talk to the camera because I, last

37:53.680 --> 37:57.840
 time I did it, I recorded every single time I did a leg, I

37:57.840 --> 38:00.960
 recorded something I'm grateful for. It's just kind of

38:00.960 --> 38:04.160
 unrelated. I'm not a fan of like talking about like how I'm

38:04.160 --> 38:07.600
 feeling or how the run is going. I want to do something

38:07.600 --> 38:11.280
 totally unrelated to the run and with the run as the

38:11.280 --> 38:14.080
 background, you know, sort of something I'm grateful for,

38:14.080 --> 38:18.720
 just any kind of interesting discussion. Gratitude. I mean,

38:18.720 --> 38:22.000
 I hate the word hack. Like, oh, it's a dopamine hack or it's a

38:22.000 --> 38:24.560
 serotonin. I don't like the word hack because A, it's

38:24.560 --> 38:29.040
 disrespectful to hackers who do a real thing and B, a hack,

38:29.040 --> 38:33.360
 it implies that it's some sort of trick that you're kind of

38:33.360 --> 38:37.760
 gaming the system. You know, what works is mechanism, right?

38:37.760 --> 38:41.760
 Biological mechanisms were designed to work and they were

38:41.760 --> 38:46.080
 selected for to work under variable conditions. And as you

38:46.080 --> 38:49.120
 know, and I know, and we have great appreciation for the fact

38:49.120 --> 38:51.440
 that the nervous system was designed to be an adaptive

38:51.440 --> 38:54.800
 machine so that you don't have to sleep eight hours every

38:54.800 --> 38:59.040
 night. Yeah. You can do this thing. And things like

38:59.040 --> 39:03.760
 gratitude allow you to tap into chemical resources and that's

39:03.760 --> 39:06.720
 not a hack. The fact that being grateful for something

39:06.720 --> 39:10.960
 external to the event happens to release serotonin and have a

39:10.960 --> 39:14.400
 certain soothing effect or a dopamine and give you more

39:14.400 --> 39:17.840
 epinephrine and let you go further. That's not a hack.

39:17.840 --> 39:21.440
 That's actually what allowed the human machine to evolve to

39:21.440 --> 39:25.120
 the point that it is now. Every time, you know, an inventor

39:25.120 --> 39:28.400
 eventually created something that worked and felt great about

39:28.400 --> 39:32.160
 it. You can imagine that the first, you know, air flight felt

39:32.160 --> 39:35.120
 pretty awesome and motivated those people to go on and do

39:35.120 --> 39:38.320
 more that they didn't just go on, you know, yawn and go have

39:38.320 --> 39:43.520
 a beer. So, being able to access the genuine internal

39:43.520 --> 39:47.840
 states of gratitude and reward works. You can't trick the

39:47.840 --> 39:50.640
 system. You can't pretend that you're grateful for something,

39:50.640 --> 39:54.080
 but if you can identify or attach yourself to some larger

39:54.080 --> 39:57.680
 goal or something that's deeply gratifying to you or place it

39:57.680 --> 40:01.600
 in service to a relative that passed away that you care a

40:01.600 --> 40:06.560
 lot about, that's not a hack. That's accessing the deepest

40:06.560 --> 40:10.080
 components of your nervous system and to steal your kind of

40:10.080 --> 40:14.640
 lingo. Yeah, there's real beauty there, right? Yeah, but for an

40:14.640 --> 40:17.200
 introvert like myself and I think David, I don't know if he's

40:17.200 --> 40:22.400
 an introvert, but like he's not, despite the fact that he has

40:22.400 --> 40:25.360
 written a great book and he communicates, he puts himself

40:25.360 --> 40:29.440
 out there, he's not really a fan of communication. He's not,

40:29.440 --> 40:33.600
 I don't know if he's energized by speaking his mind.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.080
 I don't know enough to know. I mean, we've done a little bit of

40:36.080 --> 40:39.040
 work together and we're in communication now and again. He's

40:39.040 --> 40:43.680
 obviously super impressive. I don't know. It seems like he's a

40:43.680 --> 40:48.000
 pretty private guy, so I don't have access to that.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.880
 For me, I'll just speak to myself and I think David is the

40:50.880 --> 40:54.320
 same, but I'll speak to myself that it was a hugely draining

40:54.320 --> 40:58.480
 thing not to experience the gratitude, experiencing the

40:58.480 --> 41:03.600
 gratitude just like you're saying is really energizing. It's

41:03.600 --> 41:08.560
 a powerful thing. It's a, it's a, it can lift up your mood, but

41:08.560 --> 41:13.280
 to turn on the camera and have to use words, which is very

41:13.280 --> 41:18.880
 difficult to do, to explain like what you're feeling and do it

41:18.880 --> 41:21.760
 in the way that you know a bunch of people will be watching,

41:21.760 --> 41:26.320
 is really draining. And one of the things I'm concerned about

41:26.320 --> 41:32.160
 that in this whole process, how do I keep my mind sharp

41:32.160 --> 41:34.960
 while also keeping the performance, the physical

41:34.960 --> 41:38.800
 performance sharp? And that's a little bit scary because

41:38.800 --> 41:43.520
 talking to David like actual intellectually sharp, like

41:43.520 --> 41:47.680
 thinking, being charismatic and as much as I can be,

41:47.680 --> 41:51.120
 and like being so maintaining a sense of humor too,

41:51.120 --> 41:55.600
 because I can be, I become with sleep deprivation, with exhaustion.

41:55.600 --> 41:59.200
 You start being the Russian bear comes out. You start being

41:59.200 --> 42:02.560
 such a, like you, I've become a David Goggins essentially,

42:02.560 --> 42:05.520
 like, Oh, it makes you irritable. Sleep deprivation makes us

42:05.520 --> 42:09.440
 irritable. Yeah. It's clear so that in the early part of the

42:09.440 --> 42:11.520
 night, we get a higher percentage of those old

42:11.520 --> 42:15.600
 tradian cycles are occupied by slow wave sleep, sometimes

42:15.600 --> 42:21.200
 just called non REM sleep. And those early night sleep bouts

42:21.200 --> 42:24.720
 are great for muscular repair and for certain forms of

42:24.720 --> 42:27.840
 learning, but REM sleep, the rapid eye movement sleep,

42:27.840 --> 42:31.040
 which it starts to accumulate and occupy more of those 90

42:31.040 --> 42:34.800
 minute trade in cycles toward the late part of a sleep bout.

42:34.800 --> 42:38.560
 So toward typically toward morning, but toward after you've

42:38.560 --> 42:41.680
 been asleep a while. That's when you do the emotional

42:41.680 --> 42:46.240
 processing. That's when we recover the ability to feel

42:46.240 --> 42:49.680
 refreshed and not irritated by things. And if you deprive

42:49.680 --> 42:54.960
 people of REM sleep, they become selectively bad at

42:54.960 --> 42:58.000
 uncoupling the emotion from things that happened in the previous

42:58.000 --> 43:00.080
 days. So the little things start to seem like big

43:00.080 --> 43:04.000
 things. I always know I'm REM sleep deprived when I'm

43:04.000 --> 43:07.760
 irritable. And when I look at like the word the and it

43:07.760 --> 43:09.600
 doesn't look like it's spelled right. And I'm kind of pissed

43:09.600 --> 43:12.080
 off about it. Like something's off. And we actually are

43:12.080 --> 43:16.800
 becoming slightly psychotic when we're REM sleep deprived.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.720
 You're not going to get a lot of REM sleep in this thing,

43:18.720 --> 43:21.040
 except as you fatigue more, if you do fall asleep, you're

43:21.040 --> 43:23.680
 going to drop more and more into REM so that those 90 minute

43:23.680 --> 43:26.480
 cycles, you won't have to go through stage one, stage two,

43:26.480 --> 43:28.720
 stage three, and then REM. You're just going to drop

43:28.720 --> 43:31.600
 right into REM. So you can count on your system to

43:31.600 --> 43:35.920
 compensate for you. But I think that just the knowledge

43:35.920 --> 43:38.640
 that you tend to get irritable as the time goes on, just

43:38.640 --> 43:40.960
 that third personing of yourself and that awareness,

43:40.960 --> 43:44.000
 the observer, that can be very beneficial because

43:44.000 --> 43:47.440
 there may be bouts during this event when you just should

43:47.440 --> 43:53.120
 probably say nothing. And maybe you just smile and record

43:53.120 --> 43:56.400
 or not smile or do whatever it is because you're going to

43:56.400 --> 43:59.040
 be conserving energy. If it feels like a grind, that's

43:59.040 --> 44:02.240
 epinephrine being released. That's epinephrine that you

44:02.240 --> 44:05.360
 could devote to the physical effort. But humor is an

44:05.360 --> 44:09.200
 amazing anecdote for this because it resets that it's

44:09.200 --> 44:12.080
 that dopamine release that gives us that fresh

44:12.080 --> 44:16.720
 perspective. And it's a real chemical thing. It's not a

44:16.720 --> 44:20.640
 hack. It's not a trick. It's not a visualization. It's

44:20.640 --> 44:26.800
 biology in action. Well, but I think the act of

44:26.800 --> 44:30.400
 interviewing, of conversation in these processes, even if

44:30.400 --> 44:33.680
 you don't want to do it, the right thing to do, even

44:33.680 --> 44:37.680
 when you're feeling irritable, is just to do the third

44:37.680 --> 44:41.280
 person view and be able to express with words that

44:41.280 --> 44:44.400
 you're feeling irritable. Like express what you're going

44:44.400 --> 44:49.040
 through. You know, use words which I hate doing. I

44:49.040 --> 44:51.440
 honestly, I think my ultimate thing would be just to

44:51.440 --> 44:54.080
 never say a single word to David Gagas and just go

44:54.080 --> 44:57.520
 through hell. It doesn't matter what we do, but to do

44:57.520 --> 45:01.680
 it quietly, to also express it. That's my ultimate hell.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.760
 And I think that's definitely going to be, if I know

45:03.760 --> 45:06.560
 David at all, he's going to try and find your buttons.

45:06.560 --> 45:09.840
 Like he's going to, I mean, he, even though he knows he

45:09.840 --> 45:12.720
 can complete this and I believe that he trusts that

45:12.720 --> 45:15.360
 you can complete it too. I believe you can, you will

45:15.360 --> 45:17.280
 complete it. You know you will complete it. Right.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.200
 There's no question about that, but he's not going to

45:19.200 --> 45:21.200
 make it easier for you. He's going to make it harder.

45:21.200 --> 45:24.240
 Well, I'm afraid. So I'm like, you know, it's very

45:24.240 --> 45:27.280
 difficult for me. So 48 miles is not easy. I have not

45:27.280 --> 45:30.640
 been training that much. I'm now ramping up, but it's

45:30.640 --> 45:34.880
 not like going to kill me. We'll see what happens.

45:34.880 --> 45:37.600
 Of course, for him, he might always get bored because I

45:37.600 --> 45:42.720
 think the 48 miles for him is easy. I think I don't

45:42.720 --> 45:45.920
 know that. I don't know that ever gets easy. I have a

45:45.920 --> 45:50.480
 friend, Casey Courgel, who works with David. He does some

45:50.480 --> 45:54.800
 physical rehab type stuff with him and he took Casey on a

45:54.800 --> 45:58.240
 50 mile and Casey said, it's like 16 miles into it. He was

45:58.240 --> 46:03.440
 just like, he hit his wall, but he found it. They find it

46:03.440 --> 46:06.640
 to get, you know, you find that portal. There is one

46:06.640 --> 46:08.720
 thing I want to mention. There's some very good

46:08.720 --> 46:11.920
 physiology that can perhaps support the actual running

46:11.920 --> 46:15.680
 effort part. These are very new data. We have a study

46:15.680 --> 46:18.240
 going on with David Spiegel at Stanford looking at how

46:18.240 --> 46:20.720
 different patterns of breathing can affect heart rate

46:20.720 --> 46:23.520
 variability. Heart rate variability is good. There's

46:23.520 --> 46:25.920
 this interesting mechanism that I think most people

46:25.920 --> 46:28.240
 might not realize, but that medical students learned

46:28.240 --> 46:31.520
 that your breathing and your heart rate and your brain

46:31.520 --> 46:33.840
 are in this really remarkable interplay. It goes like

46:33.840 --> 46:36.400
 this. When you inhale, this isn't breath work. We're

46:36.400 --> 46:39.360
 not going to do breath work, but when you inhale, the

46:39.360 --> 46:43.280
 diaphragm moves down. The heart gets a little bigger

46:43.280 --> 46:45.680
 because there's a little more space in the thoracic cavity.

46:45.680 --> 46:49.120
 As a consequence, blood flows a little bit more slowly

46:49.120 --> 46:51.680
 through that larger volume. There's a category of

46:51.680 --> 46:55.200
 neurons, the synomatrial node, that sees that, that

46:55.200 --> 46:59.120
 recognizes that slower rate through that larger

46:59.120 --> 47:01.040
 volume, sends a signal to the brainstem, and the

47:01.040 --> 47:03.040
 brainstem sends a signal back to the heart to speed

47:03.040 --> 47:05.360
 the heart up. Every time you inhale, you're in

47:05.360 --> 47:07.840
 speeding the heart up. When you exhale, the diaphragm

47:07.840 --> 47:09.840
 moves up, the heart gets a little smaller, the volume

47:09.840 --> 47:11.760
 is smaller, blood flows more quickly through the

47:11.760 --> 47:14.400
 heart, signal sent up to the brain, and the brain

47:14.400 --> 47:18.080
 sends a signal back to slow the heart down. This is

47:18.080 --> 47:21.520
 the basis of heart rate variability. At any point,

47:21.520 --> 47:23.600
 if you feel like your heart is racing and you feel

47:23.600 --> 47:27.360
 like you're working too hard per unit of effort,

47:27.360 --> 47:30.720
 focus on making your exhales longer or more

47:30.720 --> 47:33.440
 intense than your inhales. If ever you feel like

47:33.440 --> 47:35.920
 you're truly flagging, you do not have the energy

47:35.920 --> 47:38.000
 to get up. It's like, okay, it's time to go and

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
 you're exhausted. You want to draw more oxygen into

47:42.000 --> 47:44.560
 the system, get your heart rate going faster. Now,

47:44.560 --> 47:46.000
 some people want to hear this, probably thinking,

47:46.000 --> 47:47.840
 well, this is really obvious, but there's so much

47:47.840 --> 47:49.760
 out there about breath work and how to breathe and

47:49.760 --> 47:51.280
 all this stuff, but no one talks about how to do it

47:51.280 --> 47:53.760
 in real time while you're exerting effort.

47:53.760 --> 47:56.800
 So this is something like almost like second by

47:56.800 --> 48:00.560
 second, you can adjust things just in real time

48:00.560 --> 48:02.480
 based on how you're feeling, but based on the

48:02.480 --> 48:04.880
 heart rate, the experience of the heart rate.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.520
 That's right. So one thing that could be very

48:07.520 --> 48:09.200
 efficient and we're doing some work with

48:09.200 --> 48:11.840
 athletes now, these are unpublished data, but

48:11.840 --> 48:14.960
 if you, while you're running, if you want to get

48:14.960 --> 48:18.240
 into a nice cadence of heart rate variability,

48:18.240 --> 48:23.120
 do double inhales while you're running. What

48:23.120 --> 48:24.640
 this will do is that when you do the double

48:24.640 --> 48:27.040
 inhale has the effect of reopening the

48:27.040 --> 48:29.760
 avioli of the lungs. Your lungs are filled with

48:29.760 --> 48:32.240
 tons of little sacs when you, they tend to

48:32.240 --> 48:35.440
 collapse as you fatigue and carbon dioxide

48:35.440 --> 48:36.720
 builds up in the bloodstream and that's when

48:36.720 --> 48:38.320
 we start getting stress. If you've ever been

48:38.320 --> 48:39.840
 sprinting and you start getting beat and

48:39.840 --> 48:41.680
 you're going as hard as you can, what you

48:41.680 --> 48:43.280
 really need to do is double inhale and

48:43.280 --> 48:45.040
 reinflight these sacs and the lungs and

48:45.040 --> 48:47.040
 then offload a lot of carbon dioxide.

48:47.040 --> 48:48.560
 So when you're at a steady cadence and

48:48.560 --> 48:50.960
 you're feeling good, double inhale, exhale.

48:50.960 --> 48:54.320
 Double inhale, exhale is a terrific way to

48:54.320 --> 48:56.800
 breathe while you're in ongoing effort.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.360
 By the way, any recommendations or

48:59.360 --> 49:02.960
 differences in nose or mouth breathing?

49:02.960 --> 49:05.280
 So nasal breathing, there's a lot of

49:05.280 --> 49:06.640
 excitement now obviously about nasal

49:06.640 --> 49:08.320
 breathing because of James Nestor's book,

49:08.320 --> 49:10.560
 Breath. There was also, if people are

49:10.560 --> 49:12.400
 going to know about that book, that I do

49:12.400 --> 49:15.040
 feel like out of respect for my

49:15.040 --> 49:17.840
 colleagues. There was a book by Sandra

49:17.840 --> 49:19.840
 Kahn and Paul Erlich at Stanford, both

49:19.840 --> 49:21.840
 professors at Stanford, with a forward

49:21.840 --> 49:24.400
 by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.

49:24.400 --> 49:26.400
 So some heavy hitters in this book and

49:26.400 --> 49:28.800
 the book is called Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.720
 And it's all about how nasal breathing is

49:30.720 --> 49:33.760
 better for us, especially kids, than

49:33.760 --> 49:35.680
 being mouth breathers. Under most

49:35.680 --> 49:37.760
 conditions, for sake of improving

49:37.760 --> 49:38.880
 immunity, it turns out there's a

49:38.880 --> 49:40.720
 microbiome in the nose, like all sorts

49:40.720 --> 49:42.400
 of good stuff about nasal breathing

49:42.400 --> 49:46.320
 preferentially. But when we exercise,

49:46.320 --> 49:48.800
 you can do pure nasal breathing, but the

49:48.800 --> 49:50.480
 problem is once you get up to kind of

49:50.480 --> 49:52.640
 third and fourth and fifth gear effort,

49:52.640 --> 49:54.240
 you can't nasal breathe and be at

49:54.240 --> 49:55.920
 maximum capacity unless you've been

49:55.920 --> 49:57.600
 training it for a very long time. So I

49:57.600 --> 49:58.880
 would say double inhale through the

49:58.880 --> 50:00.800
 nose, offload through the mouth. So

50:00.800 --> 50:02.800
 double inhale, exhale while you're in

50:02.800 --> 50:04.640
 steady effort. And then if you really

50:04.640 --> 50:06.080
 feel like you need to gas it and you're

50:06.080 --> 50:09.040
 pushing, the data show that then just

50:09.040 --> 50:11.040
 use whatever's there, right? Just go

50:11.040 --> 50:13.760
 into kind of default mode because

50:13.760 --> 50:15.280
 bringing too much concentration to

50:15.280 --> 50:17.120
 something is also going to spend up an

50:17.120 --> 50:19.360
 efferent. The goal is to get into that,

50:19.360 --> 50:20.880
 I don't like the word, but the flow

50:20.880 --> 50:22.560
 state where you're not thinking too

50:22.560 --> 50:25.280
 much, you're just in exertion. So these

50:25.280 --> 50:26.880
 are things that can help in the

50:26.880 --> 50:29.600
 transitions, but I don't think there's

50:29.600 --> 50:31.280
 any secret breathing technique. You

50:31.280 --> 50:32.720
 know, anyone who's been in the SEAL teams

50:32.720 --> 50:34.080
 will kind of, you know, they'll tell you

50:34.080 --> 50:36.480
 like, there's no breathing technique,

50:36.480 --> 50:39.280
 right? There's tools that you can

50:39.280 --> 50:41.520
 look to from time to time and these

50:41.520 --> 50:43.200
 double inhale, exhales can be great for

50:43.200 --> 50:45.200
 setting heart rate ability in very

50:45.200 --> 50:46.960
 quickly and getting into a steady cadence

50:46.960 --> 50:48.720
 while you're exercising. But if there's a

50:48.720 --> 50:50.160
 sprint, like if suddenly you guys are

50:50.160 --> 50:52.880
 sprinting, ditch the double inhale,

50:52.880 --> 50:55.600
 exhale and just sprint. One thing you

50:55.600 --> 50:57.600
 mentioned, he's probably going to push

50:57.600 --> 50:59.600
 my buttons. It's a good place to ask a

50:59.600 --> 51:02.000
 question about anger. So I'll probably

51:02.000 --> 51:04.480
 get pissed off at him at some point,

51:04.480 --> 51:08.400
 I'm guessing. And do you have

51:08.400 --> 51:11.920
 thoughts from a scientific perspective

51:11.920 --> 51:13.920
 or also just the personal philosophical

51:13.920 --> 51:15.920
 perspective about the role of anger and

51:15.920 --> 51:18.640
 all of this in managing alertness,

51:18.640 --> 51:21.840
 performance? I think about this a lot

51:21.840 --> 51:24.080
 because there's so much out there about

51:24.080 --> 51:25.760
 how important it is to do things from a

51:25.760 --> 51:29.280
 place of love, you know. I tweet about

51:29.280 --> 51:31.360
 it all the time. And I think love is

51:31.360 --> 51:33.440
 powerful, right? You know, it is

51:33.440 --> 51:35.120
 interesting that autonomic arousal

51:35.120 --> 51:36.720
 alertness, let's just make use simple

51:36.720 --> 51:39.520
 language, alertness physiologically

51:39.520 --> 51:42.240
 looks identical for love and

51:42.240 --> 51:45.840
 excitement as it does for anger and

51:45.840 --> 51:48.080
 frustration and wanting to defeat your

51:48.080 --> 51:50.720
 opponent or whoever that opponent

51:50.720 --> 51:53.600
 happens to be. They're identical except

51:53.600 --> 51:56.480
 that the love component does tend to be

51:56.480 --> 51:57.840
 associated with the release of neuro

51:57.840 --> 51:59.680
 chemicals of the serotonin and

51:59.680 --> 52:01.760
 dopamine type that do have this

52:01.760 --> 52:04.400
 replenishment component. I don't think

52:04.400 --> 52:06.480
 one wants to be in constant anger and

52:06.480 --> 52:10.080
 friction, but I mean, I'll come clean a

52:10.080 --> 52:11.120
 bit. There have been portions of my

52:11.120 --> 52:13.040
 career where some of my best work, my

52:13.040 --> 52:16.000
 extra two hours, my ability to nail a

52:16.000 --> 52:18.080
 really hard deadline or problem has come

52:18.080 --> 52:21.440
 from not wanting to get out competed or

52:21.440 --> 52:24.720
 for wanting to prove something.

52:24.720 --> 52:28.400
 These days, I'm not oriented from

52:28.400 --> 52:30.160
 that place toward my work quite as

52:30.160 --> 52:32.560
 often, but I think we should be really

52:32.560 --> 52:35.040
 honest. Anger is powerful. It provided

52:35.040 --> 52:37.680
 it's channeled. It's very, very powerful

52:37.680 --> 52:40.480
 and it can give you a ton of fuel and

52:40.480 --> 52:44.640
 gas to push when otherwise you tap.

52:44.640 --> 52:48.080
 Yeah, Joe Rogan has, aside from being a

52:48.080 --> 52:50.880
 fan of his, has been an inspiration to

52:50.880 --> 52:54.640
 sort of be, to have a kind of loving

52:54.640 --> 52:56.080
 view on the world in the way you

52:56.080 --> 52:58.960
 approach the world, to me, so I've

52:58.960 --> 53:01.280
 tended to want to approach the world

53:01.280 --> 53:03.280
 that way, but in the same way David

53:03.280 --> 53:07.840
 Goggins has been an inspiration to like

53:07.840 --> 53:12.160
 yeah, be angry at stuff and use it as

53:12.160 --> 53:15.760
 fuel. Like he almost conjures up

53:15.760 --> 53:17.920
 artificial demons in his mind just so

53:17.920 --> 53:21.360
 he can fight them. You know, but at the

53:21.360 --> 53:23.120
 same time I tried that because I did a

53:23.120 --> 53:26.080
 challenge in the summer of a world for

53:26.080 --> 53:27.840
 30 days. I was doing a lot of pushups

53:27.840 --> 53:32.080
 and it was over time. It was counter

53:32.080 --> 53:35.760
 productive for me. I found that it was

53:35.760 --> 53:40.320
 easier to just, like the roller coaster

53:40.320 --> 53:42.960
 that the emotional, like being angry at

53:42.960 --> 53:46.080
 stuff takes you can also be exhausting.

53:46.080 --> 53:48.640
 Oh, absolutely. And it can take you down,

53:48.640 --> 53:51.280
 like the the ups of it are good, but the

53:51.280 --> 53:54.800
 downs are bad. And what I found is

53:54.800 --> 53:56.880
 better to get, to use it as a boost

53:56.880 --> 53:58.880
 every once in a while, but mostly to get

53:58.880 --> 54:01.280
 lost in the, you're talking about the

54:01.280 --> 54:04.320
 breath work, the, like getting lost in

54:04.320 --> 54:06.480
 the ritual of it, like the, the beat,

54:06.480 --> 54:08.320
 like that, as opposed to going on the

54:08.320 --> 54:10.720
 big roller coasters of emotion.

54:10.720 --> 54:12.640
 Yeah, this brings us into the realm of

54:12.640 --> 54:14.880
 neuroendocrinology. There's a

54:14.880 --> 54:16.400
 fascinating relationship between the

54:16.400 --> 54:18.240
 hormone system and the nervous system.

54:18.240 --> 54:21.120
 And, you know, hormones work in general on

54:21.120 --> 54:22.560
 slower time scales. The definition of

54:22.560 --> 54:23.840
 hormone is something, is a chemical

54:23.840 --> 54:25.360
 released at one location in the body,

54:25.360 --> 54:27.280
 goes in and acts at multiple locations

54:27.280 --> 54:29.360
 far away and within the body. Pheromone

54:29.360 --> 54:32.160
 would be between two bodies. Neuro

54:32.160 --> 54:33.840
 chemicals like dopamine and serotonin

54:33.840 --> 54:35.120
 tend to work a little more quickly. There

54:35.120 --> 54:36.800
 are hormones like adrenaline and

54:36.800 --> 54:38.880
 cortisol that can work very fast, but

54:38.880 --> 54:41.200
 here I'm referring mainly to

54:41.200 --> 54:44.480
 testosterone, prolactin. Prolactin tends

54:44.480 --> 54:45.920
 to be in men and women tends to make

54:45.920 --> 54:48.240
 people kind of lazy and want to take

54:48.240 --> 54:50.480
 care of young. It tends to throw down

54:50.480 --> 54:52.880
 body fat so we can stay up late. It's

54:52.880 --> 54:54.800
 secreted in response to having children.

54:54.800 --> 54:58.080
 These are all in humans and in animals.

54:58.080 --> 54:59.760
 There's a very interesting relationship

54:59.760 --> 55:03.920
 between testosterone and dopamine

55:03.920 --> 55:06.480
 that speaks directly to what we're

55:06.480 --> 55:09.760
 talking about now. So dopamine and

55:09.760 --> 55:12.320
 testosterone are closely related in the

55:12.320 --> 55:15.200
 pituitary system and obviously

55:15.200 --> 55:16.800
 testosterone comes from the adrenals and

55:16.800 --> 55:20.400
 from the testes. But the major

55:20.400 --> 55:22.400
 effect of testosterone is to make

55:22.400 --> 55:25.120
 effort feel good. That's what

55:25.120 --> 55:27.040
 testosterone does. It has other effects

55:27.040 --> 55:28.640
 too, right? Reproductive effects,

55:28.640 --> 55:31.520
 androgenizing parts of the body, etc.

55:31.520 --> 55:34.640
 But it makes effort feel good. The

55:34.640 --> 55:36.640
 testosterone molecule is synthesized

55:36.640 --> 55:39.040
 from cholesterol. Cholesterol can

55:39.040 --> 55:41.520
 either be made into cortisol, a stress

55:41.520 --> 55:43.760
 hormone, or testosterone, but not both.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.360
 So you have a limited amount of

55:45.360 --> 55:47.360
 cholesterol and it gets

55:47.360 --> 55:50.160
 diverted towards stress or this

55:50.160 --> 55:53.440
 pathway where effort feels good.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.200
 That's the pathway you want to get into.

55:55.200 --> 55:56.960
 The anger pathway, if we were to just

55:56.960 --> 56:00.160
 kind of play a mind experiment here,

56:00.160 --> 56:02.720
 the anger eventually is going to divert

56:02.720 --> 56:04.960
 more of that cholesterol molecule to

56:04.960 --> 56:06.960
 cortisol and stress and you will be

56:06.960 --> 56:09.120
 slowly depleting testosterone. Now going

56:09.120 --> 56:11.760
 into this, you'll have plenty of

56:11.760 --> 56:13.200
 testosterone. But after a couple days,

56:13.200 --> 56:14.800
 there have been very interesting studies

56:14.800 --> 56:16.480
 showing that testosterone doesn't

56:16.480 --> 56:18.000
 necessarily drop with sleep

56:18.000 --> 56:20.240
 deprivation. That's a bit of a myth.

56:20.240 --> 56:21.920
 You need it to replenish testosterone.

56:21.920 --> 56:23.440
 You need sleep to replenish testosterone

56:23.440 --> 56:25.680
 eventually. But the real question is,

56:25.680 --> 56:27.840
 are you enjoying what you're doing?

56:27.840 --> 56:31.040
 And here, some of the major work on

56:31.040 --> 56:33.440
 this was done by Duncan French, who

56:33.440 --> 56:35.200
 runs the UFC Training Center. He did his

56:35.200 --> 56:38.160
 PhD at Yukon Stores, did a really

56:38.160 --> 56:40.320
 beautiful PhD thesis looking at the

56:40.320 --> 56:42.000
 relationship between stress hormones

56:42.000 --> 56:44.720
 testosterone and dopamine. Really

56:44.720 --> 56:47.760
 interesting work. And the takeaway

56:47.760 --> 56:50.000
 from all of this is if you can just

56:50.000 --> 56:52.400
 convince yourself or ideally if you can

56:52.400 --> 56:55.200
 just enjoy yourself, you're going to

56:55.200 --> 56:56.880
 maintain or maybe even increase

56:56.880 --> 56:59.360
 testosterone stores, which will make

56:59.360 --> 57:02.320
 effort feel good. And to me, aside from

57:02.320 --> 57:04.080
 neuroplasticity where everything becomes

57:04.080 --> 57:07.680
 automatic after this experience, to me

57:07.680 --> 57:09.840
 that's the holy grail. When effort feels

57:09.840 --> 57:12.640
 good, life just gets way better. And

57:12.640 --> 57:14.080
 we're not talking about achieving the

57:14.080 --> 57:15.840
 reward. I'm not talking about the end of

57:15.840 --> 57:17.680
 this thing. I'm talking about the process

57:17.680 --> 57:19.440
 of it feeling really good.

57:19.440 --> 57:23.520
 Yeah, there is a magic to, I don't know

57:23.520 --> 57:25.360
 if you can comment on this, but I find

57:25.360 --> 57:29.200
 myself being able to, if I just say I'm

57:29.200 --> 57:32.480
 feeling good, like this old hack of

57:32.480 --> 57:35.520
 like smiling while you're running. If I

57:35.520 --> 57:37.280
 just tell myself, I'm feeling really

57:37.280 --> 57:39.440
 good right now. No matter how I'm

57:39.440 --> 57:41.600
 actually feeling, I'll start feeling way

57:41.600 --> 57:43.520
 better. And the whole thing, there's a

57:43.520 --> 57:47.040
 cascading effect that allows me to

57:47.040 --> 57:49.200
 maximize the effort. It's quite

57:49.200 --> 57:51.360
 fascinating. It's weird.

57:51.360 --> 57:53.360
 Hormones are powerful. The relationship

57:53.360 --> 57:55.120
 between thoughts and hormones and these

57:55.120 --> 57:57.280
 physiological things is enormous. I had a

57:57.280 --> 57:59.040
 colleague that a few years ago, he was

57:59.040 --> 58:02.000
 dying of pancreatic cancer. And I was

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
 interviewing him just because he's an

58:04.000 --> 58:05.760
 important figure in our community and I

58:05.760 --> 58:08.480
 was a friend. And there was one day where

58:08.480 --> 58:10.400
 he told me, he said, you know, I don't

58:10.400 --> 58:12.400
 want to make it past the new year. I

58:12.400 --> 58:14.240
 just, and it was crushing for me to

58:14.240 --> 58:16.160
 hear. And I knew that he had been on

58:16.160 --> 58:19.200
 some androgen therapy for a whole

58:19.200 --> 58:21.040
 set of other things. And I said, you

58:21.040 --> 58:24.160
 know, have you taken your androgen

58:24.160 --> 58:25.440
 cream? And he was like, no, I haven't

58:25.440 --> 58:27.600
 done it. Go get it for me. I have this

58:27.600 --> 58:29.280
 on film. He takes it, he puts the

58:29.280 --> 58:30.720
 androgen cream on. I'm not suggesting

58:30.720 --> 58:33.200
 people take androgens, by the way. 10

58:33.200 --> 58:35.760
 minutes later, he says, you know what? I

58:35.760 --> 58:37.360
 think I want to live into the new year.

58:37.360 --> 58:38.960
 And I'm going to write 12 letters of

58:38.960 --> 58:40.560
 recommendation. He went to MIT, by the

58:40.560 --> 58:42.480
 way. He said, I'm going to write 12

58:42.480 --> 58:44.640
 letters of recommendation. And he did.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.240
 And so there's something about these

58:46.240 --> 58:49.440
 molecules that in an ancient way, in

58:49.440 --> 58:51.680
 all organisms, all mammals as far as we

58:51.680 --> 58:54.560
 know, are linked to the will to live.

58:54.560 --> 58:56.480
 They're linked to effort and making

58:56.480 --> 58:57.920
 effort feel good, which has been

58:57.920 --> 58:59.600
 fundamental to the evolution of our

58:59.600 --> 59:01.760
 species. I always say, people think that

59:01.760 --> 59:03.840
 the opposite of testosterone is estrogen,

59:03.840 --> 59:05.440
 but it's not. The opposite of

59:05.440 --> 59:07.920
 testosterone is prolactin, which makes us

59:07.920 --> 59:10.080
 feel quiescent and not in pursuit of

59:10.080 --> 59:13.200
 things, et cetera. Testosterone makes

59:13.200 --> 59:15.520
 effort feel good. Estrogen makes

59:15.520 --> 59:19.040
 emotions feel okay.

59:19.040 --> 59:22.960
 And they are in mixed amounts in

59:22.960 --> 59:25.200
 people, as I say, of all chromosomal

59:25.200 --> 59:27.600
 backgrounds. Yeah. I mean, you also

59:27.600 --> 59:29.680
 mentioned fasting potentially through

59:29.680 --> 59:32.800
 this two day thing. It'd be cool to get

59:32.800 --> 59:34.960
 your thoughts about fasting in general.

59:34.960 --> 59:38.800
 Do you think on a personal level and at

59:38.800 --> 59:41.120
 a higher sort of level of studies that

59:41.120 --> 59:44.400
 you're aware of and physiology and so on,

59:44.400 --> 59:45.760
 what do you think about intermittent

59:45.760 --> 59:48.640
 fasting of like not eating for 16 hours

59:48.640 --> 59:51.760
 and then having an eight hour window or

59:51.760 --> 59:53.360
 something I've been doing a lot recently,

59:53.360 --> 59:56.800
 which is eating only once a day. So

59:56.800 --> 59:59.600
 that's 24 hour fast, I guess, one meal a

59:59.600 --> 1:00:03.840
 day or something I've been thinking

1:00:03.840 --> 1:00:06.320
 about doing, haven't done yet, of doing

1:00:06.320 --> 1:00:08.880
 like 72 hours, and some people do like

1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:11.760
 five day fasts in general. So this will

1:00:11.760 --> 1:00:14.400
 be, for this particular run, will be a

1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:17.840
 48 hour fast if I don't eat at all. What

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:19.600
 do you think about that for performance,

1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:21.760
 for mood, for all those kinds of things?

1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:23.600
 I can speak a little bit to the science

1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:25.200
 and a little bit of my own experience

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:27.040
 and then some anecdotes of people that

1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:29.040
 have done very hard, very long duration

1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:30.320
 things and what they've told me. So I

1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:31.680
 just want to make sure I'm separating

1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:34.000
 those out so people know my sourcing.

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.480
 I think now none of this is about the

1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:38.640
 actual long term nutritional benefits

1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:40.720
 of one thing or the other. But if you

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:42.000
 look at the science on intermittent

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:45.280
 fasting, it's pretty remarkable. Before

1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:46.640
 I was at Stanford, my lab was in San

1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:48.160
 Diego, one of my colleagues was such in

1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:51.840
 Panda at the Salk is phenomenal

1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:53.600
 biologist and researcher, wrote a book

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:55.200
 called The Circadian Code. It's very,

1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:57.440
 very good and kind of popularized

1:00:57.440 --> 1:00:58.800
 intermittent fasting, although there

1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:01.280
 were others that had talked about this

1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:03.120
 before. Ori Hofmeckler talked about the

1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:05.520
 warrior diet. People probably might not

1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:07.840
 know who Ori is, but he's sort of the

1:01:07.840 --> 1:01:10.160
 originator of this business of

1:01:10.160 --> 1:01:11.440
 intermittent fasting. He didn't want to

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:13.440
 day or limited. Anyway, Sachin has

1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:15.920
 published papers, peer reviewed papers

1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:18.080
 in very good journals like Cell and

1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:20.880
 elsewhere showing that limiting the

1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:24.720
 consumption of calories to eight, four,

1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:27.040
 six or eight or even 10 hours of every

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:30.640
 24 hour cycle and keeping that more or

1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:33.360
 less correlated with the light when

1:01:33.360 --> 1:01:36.640
 the sun is out leads to less liver

1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:39.760
 disease, improved metabolic markers, less

1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:42.560
 body fat, etc. In the mouse studies, they

1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:43.920
 even gave the mice the choice to eat

1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:45.440
 whatever they wanted as much as they

1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:46.720
 wanted as long as they restricted it to

1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:49.040
 a certain period within the 24 hour

1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:51.680
 cycle. They did great. They

1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:52.880
 maintained a healthy weight or even

1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:54.480
 lost weight when they took the same

1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:56.080
 amount of food and they stretched it out

1:01:56.080 --> 1:01:58.160
 across the 24, the entire 24 hour cycle.

1:01:58.160 --> 1:01:59.680
 So this is eating every hour or two

1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:02.160
 hours. The animals got fat and sick.

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:04.720
 So it's pretty remarkable data. How much

1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:06.160
 of that translates to humans isn't

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:07.760
 clear, but one thing that's really

1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:10.240
 clear with humans is adherence. We

1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:11.920
 could talk a lot about nutrition and

1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:13.600
 some of the problems with the studies

1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:15.040
 on nutrition is that what people will

1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:16.880
 do in a laboratory is often hard to do

1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:19.440
 in the real world. Low carbohydrate

1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:22.240
 diets, because they tend to

1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:24.560
 focus on foods that have high amino

1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:27.360
 acid content like meats, generally

1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:29.760
 people are less hungry on those than

1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:32.880
 they are on calorie matched diets of

1:02:32.880 --> 1:02:34.640
 fruits and vegetables and carbohydrates

1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:36.800
 because when the insulin goes up, you

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:38.560
 get hungry and you want to eat more. So

1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:40.720
 this is not a push for carnivore or a

1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:42.400
 push against one thing or the other.

1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:45.040
 It's just there are a lot of factors.

1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:48.400
 But we know for sure that when you're

1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:50.800
 fasted or when you have low amounts of

1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:52.560
 carbohydrate in your system, complex

1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:54.480
 carbohydrate, your alertness is going to

1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:56.480
 go up. Fast increases

1:02:56.480 --> 1:02:59.920
 increases alertness and epinephrine

1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:01.440
 for the sole purpose of getting you to

1:03:01.440 --> 1:03:03.200
 go out and find food. Can you imagine if

1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:05.200
 our ancestors got hungry and they were

1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:07.120
 like, oh I'm too tired to go find food?

1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:08.960
 We wouldn't be here. You'd be like robots

1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:10.240
 or something like one of your

1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:12.800
 alien buddies will be like running

1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:15.840
 the planet. So I think that if you want

1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:18.400
 to be alert, fasting or keeping

1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:20.480
 complex carbohydrates to a minimum is

1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:23.120
 very valuable. If you want to sleep and

1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:25.440
 you want to be sleepy, ingesting foods

1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:27.600
 that have a lot of tryptophan, which is

1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:29.360
 the precursor to serotonin, so complex

1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:31.200
 carbohydrates like rice and grains,

1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:33.280
 turkey, white meats, those things do

1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:35.200
 create a sense of sleepiness. However,

1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:37.200
 there is a caveat and this is one

1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:39.280
 problem with the once a meal, once a day

1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:42.000
 meal, is that anytime you have a lot of

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:43.840
 food in the gut, you're increasing

1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:45.520
 sleepiness because you're diverting

1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:47.280
 blood to the gut. It's going to trigger

1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:50.000
 the vagus to signal to the brain to

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.480
 shut down your system and utilize those

1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:54.480
 nutrients, digest and utilize those

1:03:54.480 --> 1:03:57.440
 nutrients. So I've done the once a day

1:03:57.440 --> 1:03:59.280
 eating thing. The problem is I eat so

1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:02.080
 much in that meal that I'm exhausted

1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:04.080
 and so it doesn't always lend itself

1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:05.600
 well to the schedule.

1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:07.520
 But so in a six or eight hour eating

1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:09.920
 block for me is a little bit better.

1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:11.920
 I do eat carbohydrates. I'm probably one of the few

1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:13.200
 people left on the west coast that

1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:14.720
 actually consumes carbohydrates and

1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:15.840
 will say that out loud. I don't know

1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:17.760
 people eat carbs anymore. That's weird.

1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:19.920
 They don't. Or do you even find carbs these days?

1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:22.000
 I like oatmeal. I like rice. The other

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:23.680
 time is if people are doing very high

1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:24.960
 intensity weight training, they need to

1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:27.280
 replenish glycogen. On the alertness

1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:29.200
 side, I do feel like it's probably

1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:32.480
 person independent. For me, alertness,

1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:35.120
 being alert makes my life better in a

1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:37.360
 lot of ways more than just the

1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:38.640
 alertness itself.

1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:40.800
 Like for example, one of the things that

1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:44.160
 discovered with fasting is that when I

1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:46.400
 was training twice a day in Jiu Jitsu,

1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:48.880
 for example, I'm competing and so on, I

1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:51.600
 performed way better at things that you

1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:53.520
 traditionally would say you need carbs

1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:55.440
 for, which is explosive movements and all

1:04:55.440 --> 1:04:56.720
 that.

1:04:56.720 --> 1:05:00.080
 I don't know if I actually perform better

1:05:00.080 --> 1:05:03.680
 in terms of like the force of the

1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:07.360
 explosion, the explosiveness. What I do

1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:10.800
 know is the alertness resulted in me

1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:13.360
 doing the technique more precisely.

1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:14.960
 That's the dopamine and epinephrine

1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:18.720
 system in action. There are some

1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:23.120
 other just purely physical aspects to

1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:25.360
 one diet versus the other that can be

1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:26.640
 complicated. If you're ingesting

1:05:26.640 --> 1:05:28.560
 carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates,

1:05:28.560 --> 1:05:29.760
 you're going to replenish glycogen,

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.920
 which is great, but they also tend to be

1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:34.400
 bulky and fibrous. I've never rolled

1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:36.400
 Jiu Jitsu, but running when you have a

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:38.400
 lot of bulky, fibrous food in your

1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:40.640
 gut or in your intestine, it can be a

1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:42.960
 barrier. It can be uncomfortable. Some

1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:45.200
 people do really well on low carbohydrate,

1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:47.360
 meat rich diets because they're just not

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:49.680
 as bloated. They're not carrying as much

1:05:49.680 --> 1:05:51.840
 water and other stuff. Carbohydrate

1:05:51.840 --> 1:05:54.000
 carries a lot of water molecules with it.

1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:55.600
 There are aspects to being able to

1:05:55.600 --> 1:05:56.880
 train and being really explosive because

1:05:56.880 --> 1:05:58.960
 you feel light. One anecdote that

1:05:58.960 --> 1:06:01.440
 really, again, I'm not encouraging any

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:02.800
 one particular kind of diet, but I have a

1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:07.040
 friend who was in the SEAL teams,

1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:08.160
 happened to know a number of people in

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:09.760
 that community. He told me that he did

1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:12.240
 this very long fast. It was a fast that

1:06:12.240 --> 1:06:14.080
 I think you get to eat a little bit of

1:06:14.080 --> 1:06:16.320
 soup or broth and there's like a bar

1:06:16.320 --> 1:06:17.840
 or something, but it's like a nine day

1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:21.120
 thing. He's a very strong athlete.

1:06:21.120 --> 1:06:24.960
 He said that on day six or seven, he was

1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:27.360
 running up some hills or something while

1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:30.800
 he was on deployment. He felt

1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:32.640
 amazing. He had kind of hit this other

1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:34.000
 level. He was somebody who had boxed in

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:35.920
 the Naval Academy. He was somebody who

1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:40.720
 knows and knew high output and he felt

1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:43.600
 like he discovered the 13th floor,

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:45.520
 that there was another floor to this

1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:47.200
 performance space that he hadn't

1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:50.400
 experienced except while he had fasted.

1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:52.160
 He said that that was a remarkable

1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:54.480
 clarity of mind, energy. It's a little bit

1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:55.920
 of what you described. He described a

1:06:55.920 --> 1:06:58.000
 kind of suppleness and explosiveness.

1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.120
 So there's probably something there on which day.

1:07:01.120 --> 1:07:03.600
 Once he was in the fifth or sixth day of the

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:05.200
 fast. See, this is the thing. I've never

1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:08.240
 been there on the second, third, fourth,

1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:10.640
 fifth day, that kind of thing, but when I

1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:15.760
 just don't eat for 20 hours, many times

1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:19.200
 through my training, the clarity, it's like

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:21.680
 you feel like everyone is moving super

1:07:21.680 --> 1:07:25.040
 slowly and you're able to like dominate

1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:26.960
 people you weren't able to before. It's

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:29.600
 like you might have slipped into or

1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:32.400
 switched over rather into full ketosis

1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:35.360
 and ketogenic diets done properly can be

1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:37.040
 great for people. The problem is if you do

1:07:37.040 --> 1:07:38.560
 it wrong, you can really mess it up. I

1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:40.160
 tried it once and I basically got

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:41.840
 psoriasis. I thought my scalp was gonna

1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:43.680
 fall off. I was like sloughing off all

1:07:43.680 --> 1:07:45.680
 this and then I stopped and I was

1:07:45.680 --> 1:07:47.360
 taking the liquid ketones and then

1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:48.880
 all of a sudden I felt better again.

1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:52.000
 But I was told that I just did it wrong.

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.240
 Yes, that's right. So I think there's a

1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:56.000
 right way and a wrong way and you have to

1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.920
 get it right. Definitely and so I've

1:07:57.920 --> 1:08:00.080
 experimented quite a bit with keto 2 to

1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:01.840
 see how my body feels and doing it the

1:08:01.840 --> 1:08:03.040
 right way and following all the

1:08:03.040 --> 1:08:05.200
 instructions. There's definitely a huge

1:08:05.200 --> 1:08:08.480
 difference that like for example one of

1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:09.840
 the things I discovered everyone know

1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:13.120
 we said this and but I tried this

1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:16.080
 recently over the past year as I started

1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:19.040
 drinking when I don't feel great if I'm

1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:22.880
 fasting bone broth, chicken bone broth.

1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:24.640
 And for some reason like magically it

1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:26.720
 could be, this is the other thing, the

1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:29.520
 mind I don't know, but it makes me feel

1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:32.720
 really good. Well it could be the salt.

1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:35.040
 So I mean neurons, the action potential

1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:36.800
 neurons as you know is sodium is rushing

1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:38.480
 into the cell. You need enough extra cell

1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:40.960
 or sodium in order for your brain and

1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:43.120
 nervous system to function. And so salt,

1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:45.760
 I mean unless people have hypertension

1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:47.120
 salt is great. There was an article in

1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:48.960
 Science Magazine about a decade ago

1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:50.880
 about how salt had been demonized and

1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:52.560
 unless people have hypertension provide

1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:54.480
 you drink enough water. Salt is great.

1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:56.560
 You need sodium magnesium and potassium

1:08:56.560 --> 1:08:58.960
 to function and for your nerve cells to

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:00.480
 work. I mean people who over drink

1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:02.480
 water and don't consume enough electrolyte

1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:05.520
 die. Now hydration is really important. I

1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:07.120
 know David's really into hydration.

1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:08.640
 He's mentioned that a few times. I mean

1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:11.760
 hydrating properly is key and so you

1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:13.360
 definitely want to make sure that you're

1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:14.720
 drinking enough water and getting enough

1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:16.720
 electrolytes. That I mean we should have

1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:17.760
 actually talked about that at the

1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:19.120
 beginning because that's going to keep

1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:21.280
 your nervous system functioning well.

1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:23.280
 And a lot of people they'll get shaky or

1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:25.760
 jittery and when they're fasting and

1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:28.160
 they'll think they need sugar and if

1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:29.840
 they just put some salt and some water

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:31.440
 they feel fine. And like the other

1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:33.520
 stuff potassium, magnesium, whatever the

1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:35.680
 other electrolytes are but yeah. Yeah

1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:37.920
 those three. So I mean salt yeah.

1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:41.760
 Magnesium is good before sleep salt.

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:43.600
 I mean this is a vast space and we're

1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:44.640
 kind of talking about the overlap

1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:47.440
 between neurochemicals, hormones and

1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:49.600
 nutrition and it's a fascinating space

1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:51.600
 and it's one that the academic community

1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:54.720
 has gems up within the textbooks. It

1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:56.640
 hasn't really made it into the public

1:09:56.640 --> 1:09:58.480
 sphere yet and I think that's because

1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:01.040
 people get so caught up in the you know

1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:03.440
 being are you vegan or are you carnivore

1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:05.600
 and there's a vast space in between

1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:06.960
 too that people can explore like I'm

1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:10.320
 not a competitive athlete so I eat meat

1:10:10.320 --> 1:10:12.240
 and I also eat vegetables and I eat

1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:14.240
 fruits and it's just about timing them

1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:15.600
 but I tend to eat carbohydrates when I

1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:16.880
 want to be sleepy. I eat them at night

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.640
 and everyone said that's the worst thing

1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:20.560
 you can't do that. You sleep great after

1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:22.560
 eating a big bowl of pasta I'll tell you.

1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:24.640
 And by the way I should give you a big

1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:26.960
 thank you for connecting me with Bell

1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:30.720
 Campo Farms. They sent me some meat

1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:34.320
 I think because of you and it's delicious.

1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:37.360
 So I really appreciate that. I mean

1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:39.600
 it also connected me with this whole

1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:42.880
 world of people who are doing farming in

1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:44.960
 this ethical way and like really love

1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:47.920
 the whole process and like and as from

1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:49.920
 both like a human level but also

1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:54.480
 scientific level and the result is

1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:57.600
 it's like ethical but also delicious

1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:00.240
 and it makes you think about your diet

1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:02.080
 in a whole new kind of way. Yeah I've

1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:03.840
 known I don't have any commercial

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:05.440
 relationship to Bell Campo so I can be

1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:07.280
 very clear. I've known Anya Fernald

1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:10.320
 who is the founder and CEO of Bell

1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:11.680
 Campo. I've known her since the ninth

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:13.840
 grade. It is true that her parents are

1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:15.200
 faculty members at Stanford. They're

1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:16.800
 colleagues of mine but she's just a

1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:19.600
 serious academic of nutrition but also

1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:22.000
 of sustainable agriculture of you know

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:23.280
 all sorts of things and also the meat

1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:25.040
 just it's awesome it tastes really good

1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:26.720
 and no I'm not getting paid to say that

1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:28.480
 and no they're not a sponsoring my

1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:30.320
 podcast it's just if you I feel like if

1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:33.360
 you're gonna eat animals if that's in

1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:34.640
 your framework and you're gonna eat

1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:36.560
 animals knowing that the animals were

1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:40.000
 raised as happy as could be until you

1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.880
 know time of slaughter is at least

1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:44.880
 important to me. And I actually talked

1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:46.640
 to her so I will talk to her on this

1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:49.200
 podcast actually and she invited me

1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:51.680
 like a week ago out to to visit the

1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:53.440
 farm in May or June or whatever. Yeah

1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:54.640
 they have the farm up at the Oregon

1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:55.920
 board. I haven't been there yet but I've

1:11:55.920 --> 1:11:57.840
 seen the pictures. It looks awesome and I

1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:00.240
 was like yes. It looks beautiful let me

1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:01.840
 know when you're going. Yeah let's go

1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:04.240
 together. You'll probably run there but

1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:07.680
 I'll drive there. Yeah but that all that

1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:10.320
 said I do want to because a lot of

1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:13.600
 people who are vegan write to me and I

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:15.120
 do want to seriously in the same

1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:17.200
 seriousness that I approached Keto I

1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:19.120
 do want to go like on a few months

1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:21.920
 to switch to a vegan diet at some point

1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:23.920
 to really try it. Yeah I haven't done it

1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:25.920
 yet because I'm afraid I'm in a function

1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:30.080
 better. I'm Argentine by my dad's side

1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:32.720
 and I I don't eat I don't eat meat

1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:35.520
 super often but well for most people

1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:38.320
 would it would seem often but but I do

1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:41.360
 love steak I do so I'm afraid I'm gonna

1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:43.040
 feel better. There's a social element to

1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:44.560
 steak you're right because coming from a

1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:47.120
 Russian background like I can't imagine

1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:49.920
 going to visit my folks like my parents

1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:52.000
 for Thanksgiving or something to say

1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.120
 mom and dad I'm you know I don't eat

1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:56.960
 meat so is it you know. Well I think if

1:12:56.960 --> 1:12:58.960
 you're gonna eat meat getting it from

1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:02.160
 sources that are compatible with you

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:05.040
 know continuation of the planet is good.

1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:07.040
 I mean there are some some real problems

1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:08.720
 with the factory farm meat you know you

1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:10.240
 drive up and down the five and you pass

1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:11.680
 that point where are there all those

1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:14.560
 cows. I mean as somebody who loves

1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:19.120
 animals it's it's clear that it's you

1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:20.560
 know you want to limit the amount of

1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:22.480
 suffering of those animals. Whenever I

1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:25.120
 hear about you know we have we know

1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:26.400
 people that hunt and that go and get

1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:28.160
 their own meat I really admire that I

1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:30.080
 admire that people do that. We don't we

1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:31.760
 don't tend to do that in the hills

1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:33.760
 around Stanford you know they're mountain

1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:35.280
 lines back there but that's about it

1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:38.800
 and I'm I'm certainly I admire the

1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:41.120
 vegan mindset of being of just making

1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:42.480
 that decision you're just not going to

1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:45.040
 consume other beings but you know I

1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:46.960
 haven't gone that way. Performance wise

1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:50.720
 I'm just curious because I was surprised

1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:53.520
 I was certain that eating five six seven

1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:55.840
 meals a day is the right thing to do for

1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:58.640
 all if you want to be perform your best

1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:01.440
 when I was like 20 or whatever and I

1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:03.680
 would eat oatmeal like I thought it's

1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:05.840
 obvious I have to have a really a lot of

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:07.520
 carbs in the breakfast. I had a lot of

1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:09.760
 preconceived notions and then when I

1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:12.320
 started eating like once a day this was

1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:15.760
 at the peak of my competing in jiu jitsu

1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:18.160
 it was like everything I know about

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:20.880
 nutrition is wrong. You realize that

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:22.560
 like you have to become a scientist

1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:24.160
 first of all you have to read literature

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:26.080
 you have to learn you experiment but you

1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:28.080
 also have to become a scientist of your

1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:30.800
 body and in the same way I have a lot

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:32.640
 of preconceived notions of what

1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:35.520
 performance is like under vegan diet and

1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:38.720
 I want to do it right like seriously

1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:41.600
 not not necessarily for the ethical

1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:43.120
 reasons but to see if it's

1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:46.000
 performance wise like can I I remember

1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:47.920
 there's like a fruitarian diet where you

1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:51.840
 eat fruit only. These extremes are like

1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:53.200
 they're pretty they're interesting

1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:55.440
 because people have this need the

1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:57.040
 extremes are informative though right

1:14:57.040 --> 1:14:58.800
 I mean well controlled experiments you

1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:00.640
 eliminate as many variables as you can

1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:02.480
 except the one you're interested in so

1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:04.800
 people are running these experiments I

1:15:04.800 --> 1:15:07.200
 think that

1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:10.080
 it's hard to imagine getting I know

1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:11.760
 people say you can get enough amino

1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:14.160
 acids from plant based sources and I

1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:16.560
 believe that I think it probably takes

1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:18.400
 a little more work.

1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:19.920
 One thing that's really clear is that

1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:22.640
 the benefit of these omega 3 omega 6

1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:24.480
 ratios like fish oils and things like

1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:25.760
 that there are some data that show that

1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:27.920
 the getting at least a thousand

1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:30.800
 milligrams of the EPA which is in high

1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:32.400
 in fish oils but other things too even

1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:36.000
 some meats and other plants it

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.960
 in double you know in matched

1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:41.680
 placebo double blind controlled studies

1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:43.280
 placebo controlled double blind studies

1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:45.600
 have shown that those can offset

1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:47.600
 antidepressive symptoms as much as some

1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:49.600
 of the selective serotonin reuptake

1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:51.760
 inhibitors like prolac and prozac and

1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:54.400
 zoloft so that's pretty impressive and

1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:56.720
 in Scandinavia people know especially

1:15:56.720 --> 1:15:58.800
 in winter to to consume a lot of those

1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:01.120
 omega 3s because they're good for you

1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:02.800
 they're good for the brain.

1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:05.680
 That's the other question nutrition wise

1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:08.160
 what kind of stuff have you come across

1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:10.240
 that's useful like I basically only

1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:14.000
 take fish oil like you said electrolytes

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.400
 electrolytes with water the David

1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:20.000
 Goggins diet fish oil plus fish oil and

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:23.360
 then again the sponsor they made it so

1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:26.000
 easier the sponsor your podcast and

1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.160
 mineathleticgreens.com slash

1:16:28.160 --> 1:16:30.240
 Hueberman support it.

1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:32.960
 I don't I don't know like it's great

1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:35.600
 stuff for sure but also just takes away

1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:37.040
 the headache of like I don't have to

1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:38.480
 think about yeah you're gonna get a

1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:40.080
 bunch of vitamins and minerals

1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:42.160
 you know does that sounds like a plug

1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:44.640
 but I have genuinely been buying it

1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:46.320
 I'm like you know no discount no

1:16:46.320 --> 1:16:48.320
 affiliation anything since 2012

1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:49.760
 I think I heard about it on the Tim Ferriss

1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:51.120
 podcast was like oh I'm gonna try that

1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:53.360
 stuff and I liked it I mean when I was

1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:55.520
 starting my lab I was working insane

1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:58.640
 hours I still work very long hours and

1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:02.080
 getting sick limits productivity and I

1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:04.320
 also wanted to train and I wasn't doing

1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:07.760
 much training back then now I try and

1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:09.280
 get you know three four sessions in a

1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:10.640
 week I'm not doing nothing like what

1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:12.320
 you and David are doing or what you

1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:14.640
 know Joe does or like you guys are way

1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:16.400
 more regimented than consistent than I

1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:17.760
 am

1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:19.520
 but I think that being healthy and

1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:22.400
 feeling good is one of the great

1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:25.360
 benefits to a career is having energy

1:17:25.360 --> 1:17:28.000
 and just being not sick.

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:31.280
 Can we take a step back to uh sleep a

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:33.440
 little bit and so people should

1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:37.040
 definitely look through your podcast

1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:40.560
 the first five episodes were on sleep

1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:43.120
 or no I guess the first opening episode

1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:44.880
 wasn't uh first one was sort of how the

1:17:44.880 --> 1:17:46.640
 brain works generally is to give people

1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:48.800
 some background and then we did four

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:50.960
 episodes on sleep including some stuff

1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:53.120
 about food temperature exercise jet lag

1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:55.520
 shift work for the jet lag folks and

1:17:55.520 --> 1:17:57.200
 shift work yeah second masterclass on

1:17:57.200 --> 1:17:59.200
 sleep and then you're going on to a

1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:02.880
 next topic in the next few episodes

1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:04.960
 which is incredible well

1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:07.120
 neuroplasticity we'll talk about it but

1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:10.720
 on sleep one of the cool things about

1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:14.720
 the human mind when it sleeps is dreaming

1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:18.560
 what do you think we understand about

1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:21.760
 the contents of dreams like what do

1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:23.760
 dreams mean all the stuff we see when

1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:25.280
 we dream

1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:28.560
 is there something that we understand

1:18:28.560 --> 1:18:31.920
 about uh the contents of dreams

1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:34.240
 some of it is very concrete so um

1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:38.800
 Matt Wilson who MIT showed in rodents

1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:40.400
 and it's been shown in nonhuman primates

1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:42.720
 and now it's been shown in humans that

1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:46.080
 there is replay of spatial information

1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:48.640
 during sleep so initially what Matt

1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:51.600
 showed was that as these little rodents

1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:53.200
 navigate through a maze there are these

1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:54.800
 cells in the hippocampus called place

1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:57.120
 cells that fire when the animal encounters

1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:00.080
 a turn or a corridor and that same

1:19:00.080 --> 1:19:02.000
 exact same sequence as replay during

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:03.760
 sleep and it turns out

1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:07.360
 this is true in uh London taxi cab drivers

1:19:07.360 --> 1:19:10.080
 before phones and GPS were what they are

1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:10.880
 today

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:13.280
 the London taxi cab drivers were famous

1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:15.760
 for knowing the routes through the city

1:19:15.760 --> 1:19:18.880
 through these mental maps and their

1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:20.720
 analysis of their place self firing

1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:22.640
 during sleep and during wakefulness and

1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:24.960
 so we are essentially taking spatial

1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:26.720
 information about the location of things

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:29.200
 and replaying it during sleep however

1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:31.360
 it's not replayed so that you remember it

1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:32.160
 all

1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:34.400
 it's replayed so that if there's a

1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:37.040
 reason to remember it the links to the

1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:39.680
 emotional system to the components of

1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:42.000
 the limbic system and hypothalamus that

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:43.840
 are relevant like you've gotten to a

1:19:43.840 --> 1:19:45.440
 car crash at a particular location or

1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:46.800
 you lost a bunch of money because you

1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:48.960
 were a cab driver uber driver we'd say

1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:49.680
 nowadays

1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:51.440
 and you were stuck at one particular

1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:53.280
 avenue all day and frustrated

1:19:53.280 --> 1:19:55.280
 you're getting yelled at by your spouse

1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:57.600
 that information gets encoded so that

1:19:57.600 --> 1:19:59.760
 you never forget that at that particular

1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:01.280
 time of day and that particular time of

1:20:01.280 --> 1:20:02.160
 year

1:20:02.160 --> 1:20:05.360
 and this thing happens so context starts

1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:06.880
 getting linked to experience so there's

1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:08.160
 spatial information

1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:10.560
 that's absolutely replayed during sleep

1:20:10.560 --> 1:20:13.280
 and we experience this sometimes as dreams

1:20:13.280 --> 1:20:15.040
 the dreams that happen early in the night

1:20:15.040 --> 1:20:17.120
 when slow wave sleep or non REM sleep

1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:18.400
 dominates

1:20:18.400 --> 1:20:21.200
 tends to be sleep of very kind of

1:20:21.200 --> 1:20:23.520
 general themes and kind of

1:20:23.520 --> 1:20:25.440
 location it's a little it can feel a

1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:27.280
 little bit eerie and kind of strange

1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:29.600
 in not so incidentally the early phase

1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:31.200
 of the night is when growth hormone is

1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:32.160
 released

1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:34.080
 in the 80s and 90s there was a drug that

1:20:34.080 --> 1:20:36.000
 was very popular it's very legal now

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.240
 called ghb

1:20:38.240 --> 1:20:41.040
 you could actually buy it at gnc or a

1:20:41.040 --> 1:20:42.800
 store then i never took it but it was a

1:20:42.800 --> 1:20:44.720
 popular party drug and some people

1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:47.040
 some famous celebrities died while on

1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:48.960
 ghb they were also on a bunch of other

1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:50.160
 things so it's not clear what killed

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:52.720
 them but ghb was very big in certain

1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:53.920
 communities

1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:56.160
 because it promoted a massive release

1:20:56.160 --> 1:20:58.560
 of growth hormone and gave people these

1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:00.480
 very hypnotic states so people go to

1:21:00.480 --> 1:21:01.680
 clubs and they were in these very

1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:03.600
 hypnotic states it was part of a whole

1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:05.120
 culture

1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:08.880
 that's early night and those dreams

1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:10.880
 tend to not have a lot of emotional

1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:12.800
 content or load

1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:14.960
 that phase of dreaming is associated

1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:15.920
 with

1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:17.840
 the occasional jolting yourself out of

1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:19.360
 sleep because it's somewhat lighter

1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:20.000
 sleep

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.240
 this the dreams that occur during REM

1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:23.680
 during rapid eye movement sleep that

1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:25.120
 dominate towards morning

1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:28.320
 are very different they tend to have

1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:30.640
 very little epinephrine is available in

1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:31.840
 the brain at that time

1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:33.360
 epinephrine again being this molecule

1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:35.120
 stress fear and excitement

1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:37.360
 you are paralyzed during these REM

1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:38.000
 dreams

1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.720
 you're you cannot move there's intense

1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:41.600
 emotion

1:21:41.600 --> 1:21:44.880
 at the level of what you're feeling and

1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:46.880
 there's so called theory of mind

1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:48.400
 theory of mind is an idea that was put

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:49.360
 forward by

1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:51.440
 simon barron cohen sasha barron cohen's

1:21:51.440 --> 1:21:52.320
 cousin

1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:53.920
 i think on the podcast i mistakenly said

1:21:53.920 --> 1:21:56.000
 that he was at uh oxford it's like the

1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:57.920
 cardinal sin he's at cambridge forgive

1:21:57.920 --> 1:21:59.440
 me i'm not british but

1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:01.760
 so the dreams in REM have are heavily

1:22:01.760 --> 1:22:03.680
 emotionally laden and it's very clear

1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:04.960
 that those dreams

1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:06.800
 and REM sleep if you deprive yourself of

1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:07.120
 them

1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:08.480
 for too long

1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:10.560
 you become irritable and you start

1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:12.000
 linking

1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.560
 generally negative emotions to almost

1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:15.760
 everything

1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:17.680
 REM the dreams that occur in REM sleep

1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:19.840
 are when we divorce emotion from our

1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:21.680
 prior experiences

1:22:21.680 --> 1:22:24.000
 and it's when we extract general rules

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.120
 and themes

1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:27.680
 uh mit seems to come up a lot today but

1:22:27.680 --> 1:22:29.760
 it's it's highly relevant susumaton

1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:30.560
 agawa

1:22:30.560 --> 1:22:31.840
 no more prize for

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:34.080
 amina galavulin but um obviously

1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:36.000
 fantastic neuroscientists as well

1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000
 has shown that the replay of neurons in

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:39.520
 the hippocampus and elsewhere in the

1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:40.240
 brain

1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:42.720
 is kind of an approximation of the

1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:44.160
 previous episode

1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:46.560
 and a lot of fear unlearning

1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:49.840
 of uncoupling emotion from hard or

1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:51.680
 traumatic events that happened previously

1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:52.400
 occurs

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:54.000
 in REM sleep so you don't want to deprive

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:55.920
 yourself of REM sleep for too long

1:22:55.920 --> 1:22:57.520
 and those dreams tend to be very intense

1:22:57.520 --> 1:22:59.200
 now epinephrine is low

1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:01.120
 so that you can't suddenly act out your

1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:02.160
 dreams

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:03.280
 but

1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:04.720
 what's interesting is sometimes people

1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:06.400
 will wake up suddenly

1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:07.760
 while in a REM dream

1:23:07.760 --> 1:23:09.280
 and their heart will be beating

1:23:09.280 --> 1:23:10.320
 really really fast

1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:12.480
 that's a surge of epinephrine that occurs

1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:14.640
 as you exit REM sleep

1:23:14.640 --> 1:23:16.320
 so you are having this intense emotional

1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:17.920
 experience without the fear

1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:19.760
 you are essentially going through therapy

1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:20.480
 in your sleep

1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:21.840
 self induced therapy

1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:22.960
 it's like trauma therapy

1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:24.560
 where you're trying to divorce the emotion

1:23:24.560 --> 1:23:25.920
 from the experience

1:23:25.920 --> 1:23:26.480
 and

1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:27.440
 then you wake up

1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:28.880
 and some people also have the other

1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:30.160
 component of REM

1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:30.720
 which is

1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:31.280
 atonia

1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:32.240
 which is paralysis

1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:33.680
 pot smokers

1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:36.160
 experience this a lot more than non pot

1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:36.640
 smokers

1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:37.920
 there's an invasion of

1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:40.000
 of paralysis into the waking state

1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:41.040
 I'm not a pot smoker

1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:42.560
 but I have experienced this

1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:44.240
 and when you wake up and you're paralyzed

1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:44.800
 for a second

1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:46.320
 it's terrifying

1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:47.600
 but then you jolt yourself

1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:48.080
 alert

1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:49.600
 so

1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:51.520
 the REM sleep is important for

1:23:52.480 --> 1:23:54.560
 kind of the self induced therapy

1:23:54.560 --> 1:23:56.640
 and forgetting the bad stuff

1:23:56.640 --> 1:23:58.800
 it's good for uncoupling the emotions

1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:00.000
 from bad experiences

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:00.480
 and

1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:00.960
 just

1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:02.000
 there are two therapies

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.400
 eye movement desensitization reprocessing

1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:04.880
 which

1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:05.440
 is a

1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:08.000
 eye movement thing that shuts down the amygdala

1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:08.720
 during therapy

1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:09.680
 not during sleep

1:24:09.680 --> 1:24:10.800
 and ketamine

1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:12.960
 which is a dissociative analgesic

1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:14.480
 it's actually very similar to PCP

1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:15.840
 and

1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:17.280
 ketamine is now being used as

1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:19.360
 as a trauma therapy when someone comes into

1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:21.120
 the ER for instance

1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:22.640
 and they were in a terrible car accident

1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:24.000
 these are horrible things to describe

1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:24.560
 but you know

1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:26.640
 they saw a relative impaled on the driving

1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:28.160
 steering column or something

1:24:28.160 --> 1:24:29.360
 and they will give this drug

1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:31.600
 to try and shut off the emotion system

1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:32.080
 so that

1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:33.600
 because they're not going to forget

1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:34.560
 let's be honest

1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:36.080
 you don't forget the bad stuff

1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:38.480
 but it is possible to uncouple

1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:39.600
 the bad events

1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:41.360
 from the emotional system

1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:42.800
 and there's all sorts of ethical issues

1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:44.400
 about whether or not that's good or bad to do

1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:45.920
 but the PTSD

1:24:45.920 --> 1:24:48.080
 is a failure to uncouple the emotion

1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:50.160
 from these intense experiences

1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:52.400
 so the goal of this kind of therapy

1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:53.200
 is

1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:54.080
 in the uncoupling

1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:55.120
 for that to be permanent

1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:56.480
 to

1:24:56.480 --> 1:24:57.440
 to separate

1:24:57.440 --> 1:24:59.280
 so they can recount the event

1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:00.880
 and they can describe it without it

1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:02.960
 triggering the same somatic experience

1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:04.080
 of terror and dread

1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:05.840
 because terror

1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:08.240
 those feelings can be debilitating obviously

1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:08.960
 and you're saying

1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:10.240
 physiologically

1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:11.680
 in REM sleep

1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:13.040
 a similar process is happening

1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:13.760
 that's right

1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:14.240
 that

1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:15.040
 thematically

1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:17.280
 REM sleep is about experiencing

1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:19.760
 or replaying intense emotions

1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:20.880
 without experience

1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:21.440
 the

1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:22.000
 somatic

1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:23.440
 the physical component of the emotion

1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:24.640
 either the acting out

1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:27.520
 or the accelerated heart rate and agitation

1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:31.440
 likewise with things like ketamine therapies

1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:32.160
 that's the ideas

1:25:32.160 --> 1:25:34.240
 you're uncoupling the physical sensation

1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:35.920
 from the mental events

1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:36.880
 what is REM sleep

1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:39.200
 and why is it so special

1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:40.480
 maybe we can comment on that

1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:42.160
 rabbit eye movement sleep

1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:43.600
 yeah discovered in the 50s

1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:44.720
 at the University of Chicago

1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:45.360
 it's

1:25:45.360 --> 1:25:46.880
 intense brain activity

1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:48.960
 high levels of metabolic activity

1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:50.560
 dreams in which people report

1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:51.920
 a lot of the theory of mind

1:25:51.920 --> 1:25:52.720
 we were talking about

1:25:52.720 --> 1:25:53.760
 Simon Baron Cohen

1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:54.800
 theory of mind

1:25:54.800 --> 1:25:56.320
 was actually something that he developed

1:25:56.320 --> 1:25:58.720
 for the diagnosis of autism

1:25:58.720 --> 1:25:59.520
 if you take kids

1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:03.120
 most kids of age five six seven

1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:04.560
 put them in front of a TV screen

1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:05.360
 in the laboratory

1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:06.400
 and you have them watch a video

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:08.080
 where a kid is playing with a ball or a doll

1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:10.720
 and then the kid puts it into a drawer

1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:12.000
 shuts the drawer and walks away

1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:13.120
 and another kid comes in

1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:13.920
 and you ask the child

1:26:13.920 --> 1:26:15.520
 who's observing this little movie

1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:15.920
 you say

1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:18.400
 what does this second child think

1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:20.720
 and a typical kid would say

1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:22.240
 they want to play

1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:23.840
 and they don't know where the ball or doll is

1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:25.520
 or they're upset

1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:26.240
 or they're sad

1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:26.960
 they want the doll

1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:28.640
 autistic children

1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:30.160
 tend to say

1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:31.200
 the doll's in the drawer

1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:33.920
 the toy is in the drawer

1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:35.440
 they tend to fixate

1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:36.560
 they can't get in

1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:37.120
 on the event

1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:38.960
 they can't get into the mind of that

1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:40.800
 they don't have a theory of mind

1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:42.000
 dreams in REM

1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000
 have a heavy theory of mind component

1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000
 people are after me trying to get me

1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.240
 you can assign motive to other people

1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:49.200
 I'm afraid

1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:50.800
 but it's because

1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:51.920
 there's an expectation

1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:53.680
 that doesn't tend to happen

1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:55.040
 in slow wave sleep dreams

1:26:55.040 --> 1:26:56.960
 now all this of course is by waking people up

1:26:56.960 --> 1:26:58.480
 and asking them what they were dreaming about

1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:01.360
 which from a standpoint of a AI guy

1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:02.480
 or a machine learning guy

1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:03.920
 or a neuroscientist kind of like

1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:05.600
 but it's the best we've got

1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:07.120
 but brain imaging

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:08.800
 in waking states

1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:10.160
 while people view a movie

1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:10.800
 and then

1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:12.240
 brain imaging while people are sleeping

1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:13.040
 supports the idea that

1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:14.480
 that's basically what's going on

1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:16.640
 so REM sleep is amazing

1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:18.480
 and you're not going to get much of it

1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:18.960
 during your

1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:20.080
 about with

1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:21.280
 Goggins

1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:22.000
 but you will

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:22.960
 afterward

1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:23.360
 why

1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:25.200
 so to comment

1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:26.400
 why won't I

1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:29.200
 so is it not possible to get into it real quick

1:27:30.240 --> 1:27:32.240
 only if you're very very sleep deprived

1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:34.320
 but because you're going to be at

1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:35.920
 high muscular output

1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:37.200
 that's going to bias you towards

1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:39.040
 more slow wave sleep overall

1:27:39.680 --> 1:27:39.920
 and

1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:40.720
 and

1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:41.920
 your body

1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:43.440
 and brain are smart

1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:44.640
 they it will know

1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:45.760
 they will know

1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:47.600
 that your main goal is to recover

1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:50.160
 so you can keep going

1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:51.200
 so you can keep firing

1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:52.480
 neuromuscular contractions

1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:53.520
 and you can keep running

1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:54.080
 so that you can

1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:55.920
 I mean it's amazing to think like

1:27:55.920 --> 1:27:56.960
 why do we ever stop

1:27:57.520 --> 1:27:58.880
 the unlike weight training

1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:01.600
 where I can't do a 500 pound deadlift

1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:02.320
 I just can't

1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:03.760
 I could train for it

1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:05.280
 but I certainly can't do a 600 pound

1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:06.160
 I can't do that

1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:09.440
 what causes us to stop

1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:10.800
 an endurance event

1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:12.720
 is usually not a physical barrier

1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:14.960
 it's almost always a purely mental barrier

1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:17.680
 and that's a very interesting problem

1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:18.960
 I mean that neuroscientists don't tend to

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:20.640
 think about those sorts of problems

1:28:20.640 --> 1:28:21.520
 because it sounds so

1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:23.760
 non neuroscientific

1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:27.040
 but that's fundamentally related to the question of

1:28:27.040 --> 1:28:27.920
 you know

1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:29.040
 what is pursuit

1:28:29.040 --> 1:28:31.360
 why what is the the desire to push

1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:33.120
 and to and to carry on

1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:34.800
 is there a neuroscientific answer

1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:35.920
 for that question you think

1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:37.200
 I think the closest thing is this

1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:39.200
 um paper from uh

1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:41.280
 from Janelia Farms

1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:42.320
 the Howard Hughes Campus

1:28:42.320 --> 1:28:43.840
 showing that if you put

1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:47.680
 animals into a simulated environment

1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:49.920
 where you can measure their effort

1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:51.520
 the forces on while they're running

1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:52.320
 and you can look at the

1:28:52.320 --> 1:28:53.760
 and you can control the visual environment

1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:54.880
 and you can create a scenario

1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:56.720
 where the animal thinks that it's

1:28:56.720 --> 1:28:58.000
 output is futile

1:28:58.000 --> 1:28:59.760
 it thinks it knows it's running

1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:00.880
 and it's actually running

1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:02.320
 but you change the frequency

1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:03.600
 of the stripes going by

1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:04.800
 in their visual world

1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:05.440
 such that they think

1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:07.120
 they're not getting anywhere

1:29:07.120 --> 1:29:08.480
 and eventually they quit

1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:10.480
 and the thing that determines

1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:11.440
 whether or not they quit

1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:13.440
 is a threshold level of epinephrine

1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:14.400
 in the brainstem

1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:15.920
 if you drop that level back down

1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:17.680
 or you or you give the animals

1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:19.200
 dopamine essentially

1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:20.320
 they keep going

1:29:20.320 --> 1:29:22.480
 if you take dopamine down

1:29:22.480 --> 1:29:22.640
 they

1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:24.640
 they're like this isn't worth it

1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:25.360
 it's helpless

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:25.920
 and they're just

1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:27.520
 this isn't worth my time and energy

1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:28.640
 but this is where the difference

1:29:28.640 --> 1:29:29.840
 between humans

1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:31.920
 and non human animals

1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:32.640
 is interesting

1:29:32.640 --> 1:29:34.000
 because it does feel like humans

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:35.680
 have an extra level of cognitive

1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:37.280
 ability

1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:41.360
 that might be relevant here

1:29:41.360 --> 1:29:42.880
 well you can pull from

1:29:42.880 --> 1:29:44.640
 different time references

1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:46.400
 so you're in that moment

1:29:46.400 --> 1:29:47.680
 you're going to need a kit

1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:49.280
 of things to pull from

1:29:49.280 --> 1:29:50.320
 so you can think

1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:52.480
 this is in honor of someone else

1:29:52.480 --> 1:29:53.840
 that passed away

1:29:53.840 --> 1:29:56.480
 and you will find a gas reserve

1:29:56.480 --> 1:29:57.680
 that's amazing

1:29:57.680 --> 1:29:58.400
 right now

1:29:58.400 --> 1:29:59.920
 whether or not mice are like

1:29:59.920 --> 1:30:01.120
 I remember my brother

1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:02.080
 back in the other cage

1:30:02.080 --> 1:30:03.200
 when I was a little mouse

1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:03.920
 you know

1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:04.960
 we don't know

1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:07.280
 but it's very likely

1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:08.320
 that they don't do that

1:30:08.320 --> 1:30:09.440
 that they're so present

1:30:09.440 --> 1:30:10.880
 they're in the experience of

1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:12.320
 there and then and now

1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:14.240
 that they aren't able to extract

1:30:14.800 --> 1:30:15.760
 from the past

1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:17.600
 and they're not able to project

1:30:17.600 --> 1:30:18.160
 into the future

1:30:18.160 --> 1:30:19.520
 like how great it's going to feel

1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:20.560
 when I get to the end

1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:23.360
 of this really lame VR corridor

1:30:23.360 --> 1:30:24.880
 I don't think they think about that

1:30:24.880 --> 1:30:26.560
 and and think about like

1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:27.760
 if I quit now

1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:29.520
 how will that have

1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:30.720
 what kind of effect will it have

1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:31.520
 on the rest of my life

1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:33.360
 and the future difficult times

1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:34.960
 like if you allow yourself to quit

1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:36.080
 in this particular moment

1:30:36.080 --> 1:30:37.120
 you'll become a quitter

1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:38.080
 more and more in life

1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:39.680
 and then you're going to not get

1:30:39.680 --> 1:30:40.880
 the other nice

1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:43.840
 the opposite sex mammals

1:30:44.800 --> 1:30:46.000
 that's pretty severe

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:46.640
 you went there

1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:48.720
 you took the whole way

1:30:48.720 --> 1:30:50.160
 to evolution and back again

1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:51.520
 I mean but that's really it

1:30:51.520 --> 1:30:52.960
 I mean our ability

1:30:52.960 --> 1:30:54.160
 to time reference

1:30:54.160 --> 1:30:55.280
 in the past present

1:30:55.280 --> 1:30:55.920
 or future

1:30:55.920 --> 1:30:57.520
 I do believe that we can be in

1:30:57.520 --> 1:30:59.120
 the present in the past

1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:00.480
 or the present in the future

1:31:00.480 --> 1:31:02.240
 or only in the present

1:31:02.240 --> 1:31:03.360
 or only in the future

1:31:03.360 --> 1:31:04.000
 only in the past

1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:05.440
 but I don't think that we can really

1:31:05.440 --> 1:31:06.800
 think about past present and future

1:31:06.800 --> 1:31:07.440
 all at once

1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:09.920
 and this has a similarity to

1:31:09.920 --> 1:31:10.720
 covert attention

1:31:10.720 --> 1:31:12.560
 like we can split our visual attention

1:31:12.560 --> 1:31:13.600
 into two things

1:31:13.600 --> 1:31:15.360
 we really can duo task

1:31:15.360 --> 1:31:16.480
 even though we can't multitask

1:31:16.480 --> 1:31:18.000
 so or we can bring those two spotlights

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:19.360
 of attention to the same location

1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:21.440
 but it's very hard to split our

1:31:21.440 --> 1:31:23.040
 attention in really well

1:31:23.040 --> 1:31:24.240
 into three domains

1:31:24.240 --> 1:31:24.720
 excuse me

1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:25.680
 into three domains

1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:28.480
 I think that that's very very

1:31:28.480 --> 1:31:29.200
 challenging

1:31:29.200 --> 1:31:31.680
 and our time referencing scheme

1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:32.320
 tends to be

1:31:32.960 --> 1:31:35.840
 just one or two time references

1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:38.960
 so Lisa Feldman Barrett

1:31:38.960 --> 1:31:40.560
 I'm not sure if you've done work together

1:31:40.560 --> 1:31:41.520
 but at least you can

1:31:41.520 --> 1:31:42.720
 I found out about her

1:31:42.720 --> 1:31:43.680
 because of you

1:31:43.680 --> 1:31:44.880
 your podcast with her

1:31:44.880 --> 1:31:46.080
 and then I brought her onto Instagram

1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:47.120
 doing an Instagram live

1:31:47.120 --> 1:31:48.240
 about emotion

1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:49.360
 and it was fascinating

1:31:49.360 --> 1:31:50.640
 and she's a very spirited

1:31:50.640 --> 1:31:52.800
 and very very smart woman

1:31:52.800 --> 1:31:54.160
 and fearless

1:31:54.160 --> 1:31:55.280
 and brilliant

1:31:55.280 --> 1:31:56.560
 so I love her

1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:57.200
 she's amazing

1:31:57.200 --> 1:31:58.960
 she kind of

1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:01.120
 she's not a scholar of hallucinogens

1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:02.960
 hallucinogens or dreams

1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:04.880
 but she had this intuition that

1:32:05.920 --> 1:32:07.440
 there may be a connection

1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:10.000
 between the kind of dissociation

1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:11.200
 that happens in dreaming

1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:13.200
 and that that happens in

1:32:14.800 --> 1:32:15.840
 like psychedelics

1:32:16.800 --> 1:32:19.840
 I because of my previous conversation

1:32:19.840 --> 1:32:20.240
 with you

1:32:22.160 --> 1:32:23.360
 on this podcast

1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:25.520
 Matthew Johnson from

1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:27.280
 John Hopkins reached out

1:32:27.280 --> 1:32:28.160
 and he said but

1:32:29.280 --> 1:32:30.560
 he commented I think

1:32:31.120 --> 1:32:32.720
 on something that we commented on

1:32:32.720 --> 1:32:34.160
 I don't even remember exactly what

1:32:34.160 --> 1:32:36.080
 but that there's not many studies

1:32:36.640 --> 1:32:39.040
 it's not being psychedelics

1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:40.720
 and not being rigorously studied

1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:41.840
 in an academic setting

1:32:41.840 --> 1:32:44.480
 like with a full rigor of science

1:32:44.480 --> 1:32:45.200
 and he said

1:32:45.200 --> 1:32:46.480
 well actually

1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:47.840
 that's exactly what we're doing

1:32:47.840 --> 1:32:49.520
 and they were extremely well funded now

1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:52.000
 and it was a been a long battle

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:52.880
 to get it accepted

1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:55.760
 as a serious scientific pursuit

1:32:55.760 --> 1:32:55.920
 so

1:32:57.040 --> 1:32:57.200
 but

1:32:57.760 --> 1:32:59.440
 and I'd like to ask you a little bit

1:32:59.440 --> 1:32:59.920
 about that

1:32:59.920 --> 1:33:01.360
 but do you have a sense

1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:04.880
 about connection between dreams

1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:05.840
 and psychedelics

1:33:05.840 --> 1:33:08.320
 or these different explorations

1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:09.360
 of mind states

1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:11.200
 that are outside of the standard

1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:12.000
 normal one

1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:13.840
 that's the wake mindset?

1:33:14.400 --> 1:33:16.480
 Yeah I loved your discussion with Matthew

1:33:16.480 --> 1:33:18.240
 I knew of the Hopkins group

1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:19.200
 and the stuff they were doing

1:33:19.200 --> 1:33:19.920
 but I didn't know

1:33:20.800 --> 1:33:21.680
 much about it at all

1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:23.360
 and I learned a ton from that podcast

1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:24.400
 I reached out to him

1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:24.960
 just to say

1:33:25.600 --> 1:33:26.320
 love what you're doing

1:33:26.320 --> 1:33:27.200
 I think it's incredible

1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:27.600
 so yeah

1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:29.280
 your podcast has been a great source of

1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:31.280
 serious academic

1:33:31.280 --> 1:33:32.000
 and intellectual

1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:34.160
 conversation for me

1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:37.120
 I think what they're doing at Hopkins

1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:37.840
 is amazing

1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:40.160
 he has a collaborator there

1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:41.840
 actually they had a very popular paper

1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:43.120
 I just throw out there for fun

1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:46.160
 who is a postdoc at Stanford

1:33:46.160 --> 1:33:46.960
 her name is Ghoul

1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:49.200
 she's Turkish I believe

1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:52.880
 and I apologize

1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:54.320
 her last name escapes me at the moment

1:33:54.320 --> 1:33:56.000
 but that's just a function of my brain

1:33:57.120 --> 1:33:58.080
 she had a paper showing

1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:01.520
 that she put Octopi on MDMA

1:34:01.520 --> 1:34:02.320
 on XSC

1:34:02.320 --> 1:34:03.120
 and found out

1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:04.000
 this was published in

1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:05.920
 current biology

1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:07.120
 showing it was a great journal

1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:08.320
 showing that the Octopi

1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:09.840
 then wanted to spend more time

1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:11.040
 with other Octopi

1:34:11.040 --> 1:34:12.400
 and they started cuddling

1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:14.640
 so they're colleagues out there

1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:18.000
 but the Hopkins project

1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:18.960
 is super interesting

1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:21.040
 because I think they were initially supported

1:34:21.040 --> 1:34:23.040
 mainly through private philanthropy

1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:23.920
 and now

1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:25.280
 you're starting to see some more interest

1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:26.640
 at the level of NIH

1:34:26.640 --> 1:34:27.840
 about psychedelics

1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:30.080
 it's a complicated space

1:34:30.080 --> 1:34:32.800
 because the psychedelics are always

1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:34.080
 looked at

1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:36.080
 through the lens of the 60s

1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:37.520
 and people losing their mind

1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:38.320
 and there's a

1:34:39.760 --> 1:34:40.400
 I always say

1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:42.400
 you don't want to Ken Keezy out of the game

1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:43.440
 Ken Keezy was amazing

1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:45.120
 right part of the whole beat generation thing

1:34:45.120 --> 1:34:46.480
 and he was actually at the VA

1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:48.000
 near Stanford

1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:49.440
 that's where he eventually in Menlo Park

1:34:49.440 --> 1:34:51.040
 he wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:52.240
 or maybe that was about him

1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:52.960
 anyway

1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:55.040
 the comments will tell me how wrong I am

1:34:55.040 --> 1:34:55.600
 but it's

1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:57.760
 I think I'm tossing these words in the general

1:34:57.760 --> 1:34:59.520
 in the right general direction

1:34:59.520 --> 1:34:59.760
 but

1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:01.120
 you know

1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:01.680
 Huxley

1:35:02.640 --> 1:35:03.120
 Keezy

1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:04.800
 they did a lot of LST

1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:05.360
 yeah

1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:06.400
 and they

1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:07.920
 all lost their jobs

1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:08.160
 right

1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:09.840
 they lost their jobs at big institutions

1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:11.520
 like Harvard and Stanford and elsewhere

1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:12.240
 or they left

1:35:13.360 --> 1:35:14.560
 because they

1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:17.600
 they made themselves the experiments

1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:18.000
 yes

1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:19.680
 Hopkins as far as I know

1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:22.160
 is when the first place is not the first place where

1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:25.280
 whatever Matt may or may not be doing in his own life

1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:25.760
 I don't know

1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:28.400
 it's really about the patients and whether or not

1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:29.360
 the patients in these

1:35:30.320 --> 1:35:32.640
 institutional review board approved studies

1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:34.000
 whether or not they're getting better

1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:35.200
 in situations like depression

1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:36.160
 I think

1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:39.600
 it's clear that there's a very close relationship

1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:43.120
 between hallucinogenic states and dreaming

1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:45.600
 of the sort that were described for REM dreaming

1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:46.080
 and there's a

1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:48.320
 a terrific set of books

1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:49.760
 and body of scientific literature

1:35:49.760 --> 1:35:51.520
 from a guy named Alan Hobson

1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:52.640
 who was an MD

1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:53.600
 is at Harvard Med

1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:55.520
 and he wrote books like dream drug store

1:35:56.240 --> 1:35:57.920
 one of the first neuroscience books I ever read

1:35:57.920 --> 1:35:59.520
 was about hallucinations

1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:02.080
 and how psychedelics and dreaming are very similar

1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:03.440
 that was way back when I was in high school

1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:04.160
 I was just curious

1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:07.440
 and he really understood the relationship between

1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:08.960
 LSD and REM dreams

1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:10.160
 and how similar they are

1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:13.120
 I think psychedelics

1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:14.400
 and Matt knows way more about this

1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:15.120
 than I do of course

1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:16.400
 but psychedelics

1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:19.600
 have some very interesting properties

1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:21.280
 they are certainly not for everybody

1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:23.200
 right and kids it's a problem

1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:25.520
 I think the major issues right now

1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:27.840
 around the psychedelic conversation

1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:28.560
 is that

1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:31.360
 it's clear that they can unveil

1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:32.960
 certain elements of neuroplasticity

1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:34.880
 they make the brain amenable to change

1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:37.360
 changing up space time relationships

1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:39.600
 changing up the emotional load of an event

1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:41.360
 and being able to reframe that

1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:43.120
 it's clear that happens

1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:45.120
 but there's two major issues

1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:46.320
 one is that

1:36:46.320 --> 1:36:47.840
 people talk about plasticity

1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:49.520
 as if plasticity is the goal

1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:51.520
 but plasticity is a state

1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:53.440
 within which you can direct neurology

1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:54.560
 and the question is

1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:56.640
 what changes are you trying to get to

1:36:56.640 --> 1:36:58.480
 so people are just taking psychedelics

1:36:58.480 --> 1:36:59.840
 to unveil plasticity

1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:02.160
 without thinking about

1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:04.400
 what circuits they want to modify and how

1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:05.520
 I think that's a problem

1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:08.320
 I think there's great potential however

1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:09.680
 for people opening up these

1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:12.080
 states of plasticity

1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:13.440
 with psychedelics or otherwise

1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:16.080
 and directing the plastic changes

1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:17.360
 toward a particular endpoint

1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:20.160
 and there's an absolutely spectacular paper

1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:21.120
 out of UC Davis

1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:23.680
 published as a full article in Nature

1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:24.800
 just a couple months ago

1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:26.000
 showing that

1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:28.800
 there are psychedelics that are now

1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:30.000
 can be modified

1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:31.760
 so chemists have gotten into the game now

1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:34.320
 and modifying to take away the hallucinogenic component

1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:36.880
 where you still get the neuroplasticity components

1:37:37.680 --> 1:37:39.280
 and for a lot of people it'd be like

1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:40.320
 oh that's no fun

1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:42.960
 that's not giving you the wild experience

1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:45.040
 but I do think that that holds great potential

1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:46.640
 for people that wouldn't otherwise

1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:48.560
 orient towards some of these drugs

1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:50.240
 so I think it's really marvelous

1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:51.200
 what's happening

1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:52.640
 and what's about to happen

1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:55.440
 and I think there is one drug

1:37:55.440 --> 1:37:57.360
 in that kit of drugs

1:37:57.360 --> 1:37:59.120
 that's very unusual

1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:00.720
 like psilocybin, LSD

1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:03.520
 those promote heavy heavy serotonin release

1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:06.720
 and lateralized connections ramp up etc

1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:08.160
 Matt talked about all that

1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:13.120
 but MDMA, ecstasy, is a very unusual situation

1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:16.000
 where dopamine is very very high

1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.640
 because of the way the drug is designed

1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:20.960
 dopamine release it goes through the roof

1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:22.720
 so people feel great

1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:23.680
 and they want to move

1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:25.120
 and they have a lot of energy

1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:27.440
 but serotonin levels are also high

1:38:27.440 --> 1:38:29.440
 and that's a very unnatural state

1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:33.120
 and why MDMA may

1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:34.960
 may and I want to highlight may

1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:38.160
 have particularly high potential

1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:40.720
 for the treatment of certain forms of depression

1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:43.040
 is an interesting question

1:38:43.040 --> 1:38:44.960
 because never before in

1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:47.520
 as far as we know in human history

1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:49.760
 has there been a possibility

1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:51.280
 of opening up dopaminergic

1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:52.880
 and serotonergic states at the same time

1:38:52.880 --> 1:38:54.480
 dopamine being the molecule pursuit

1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:56.240
 and reward and more and more

1:38:56.240 --> 1:38:58.480
 and serotonin being one of bliss

1:38:58.480 --> 1:38:59.920
 and being content right where you're at

1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:01.200
 so it's almost like those two things

1:39:01.200 --> 1:39:02.240
 wrap back on themselves

1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:04.400
 and create this very unusual state

1:39:04.400 --> 1:39:06.240
 and I think the bigger conversation

1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:08.240
 is what to do with a state like that

1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:09.200
 like do you

1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:11.200
 is it about self love

1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:13.360
 is it about developing love for another person

1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:15.200
 is it about forgetting hate

1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:17.120
 like these are powerful molecules

1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:19.120
 and I think if the academic community

1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:20.080
 and the clinical community

1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:22.480
 is going to move forward with them in any serious way

1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:24.320
 I think there needs to be a conversation

1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:28.240
 about what they're being used for

1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:30.400
 right and coupled with that

1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:32.240
 I think similar to what you're saying

1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:34.000
 like Matt has talked about

1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:35.200
 as others have talked about

1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:39.840
 some of the biggest benefits of like progress

1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:41.200
 whether it's like quitting smoking

1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:42.800
 and all this kind of stuff

1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:45.120
 is in the days after

1:39:45.120 --> 1:39:47.520
 it's the integration of the experience

1:39:47.520 --> 1:39:49.440
 so maybe you open up the brain

1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:50.560
 to the neuroplasticity

1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:52.160
 but then there's like work to be done

1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:53.120
 it's not

1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:54.880
 you're like you shake up something

1:39:55.840 --> 1:39:57.840
 in the biology of the brain

1:39:57.840 --> 1:39:59.200
 but you have to do then

1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:00.000
 it's work

1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:00.960
 absolutely

1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:03.280
 now a friend of mine who's a physician

1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:04.880
 he says

1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:06.480
 who's quite open to this idea

1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:08.720
 that psychedelics could play a real role

1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:10.240
 in real medicine

1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:12.160
 says better living through chemistry

1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:13.600
 still requires better living

1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:16.400
 and I think it's a beautiful statement

1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:17.200
 I wish I had said it

1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:19.360
 but he gets the credit

1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:22.480
 but the plasticity window opens

1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:23.520
 and then as you said

1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:24.800
 what are you going to do in the two weeks

1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:26.320
 three weeks four weeks afterward

1:40:26.320 --> 1:40:28.160
 because that's the real opportunity

1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:29.760
 but those psychedelic experiences

1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:32.000
 are really a case of an amplified experience

1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:33.440
 inside of an amplified experience

1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:36.160
 so much so that everything seems relevant

1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:39.680
 and it's fascinating

1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:41.840
 I mean my hope is that

1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:43.840
 the AI and machine learning

1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:45.040
 and the brain machine interface

1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:46.960
 and all that will eventually be merged

1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:49.520
 with the psychedelic treatments

1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:51.680
 so that an individual can go in

1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:53.680
 take whatever amount

1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:54.880
 of whatever safe for them

1:40:54.880 --> 1:40:56.000
 working with a clinician

1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:57.520
 and really direct the plasticity

1:40:57.520 --> 1:40:59.440
 while maybe stimulating

1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:00.240
 the orbital frontal

1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:01.840
 media orbital frontal cortex

1:41:01.840 --> 1:41:03.200
 or increasing the observer

1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:05.040
 or decreasing the observer in the brain

1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:06.400
 or decreasing the amygdala

1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:07.840
 I mean it's doable

1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:10.960
 it's doable with transcranial magnetic stimulation

1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:12.640
 and it's for shutting down activity

1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:14.480
 and it's doable with ultrasound

1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:17.280
 ultrasound now allows very focal activation

1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:19.040
 of particular brain regions

1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:20.880
 through the skull noninvasively

1:41:20.880 --> 1:41:22.800
 so it's approaching the same kind of

1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:24.720
 therapy from different angles

1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:26.640
 one of AI is the computational size

1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:28.400
 sort of injecting

1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:30.800
 like the robotics injecting

1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:32.560
 like maybe you can even think about it

1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:33.920
 as like electricity

1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:35.680
 the electrical approach

1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:38.480
 versus then like the chemical approach

1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:39.040
 absolutely

1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:42.240
 and then the psychology is subjective

1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:42.640
 right

1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:45.840
 so it's going to take some real understanding

1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:49.440
 of what that person's lexicon is

1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:50.160
 like you know

1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:50.960
 that wasn't a pun

1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:51.200
 sorry

1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:53.520
 I'm sorry terrible

1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:54.960
 I'm like the worst

1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:55.840
 that's the one thing I know

1:41:55.840 --> 1:41:57.280
 from the feedback on my podcast

1:41:57.280 --> 1:41:58.320
 my jokes are terrible

1:41:58.320 --> 1:41:59.600
 but I never claimed to be funny

1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:04.640
 but somebody who they really trust

1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:06.400
 and understands when somebody says

1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:09.360
 for a very stoic person

1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:10.400
 like I'm imagining

1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:12.000
 you interviewed the great Dan Gable

1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:13.760
 I don't know anything about Dan

1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:15.440
 but can you imagine like you asked Dan

1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:16.960
 like how you feel about something

1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:18.240
 while on one of these drugs

1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:19.440
 and like I mean

1:42:19.440 --> 1:42:21.600
 his languaging might

1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:24.240
 if he says that was troubling

1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:25.920
 it might mean that it was very troubling

1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:27.280
 or not troubling at all

1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:28.080
 so people are

1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:31.120
 languages a poor guide

1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:32.560
 because if I say I'm upset

1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:33.600
 how upset is that

1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:35.200
 well that's very subjective

1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:35.760
 so you need

1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:37.120
 we need

1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:38.240
 can you build a tool for that

1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:39.600
 can you build an AI tool for that

1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:40.240
 yeah deeper

1:42:40.240 --> 1:42:40.640
 yeah well

1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:41.120
 maybe that's the

1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:41.440
 I

1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:42.160
 maybe that's our

1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:44.800
 that's what the eyes could reveal

1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:46.240
 so language is not just words

1:42:46.240 --> 1:42:47.280
 it's everything together

1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:48.800
 and that's one of the

1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:50.320
 fascinating things about the eyes

1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:51.360
 and the window to the soul

1:42:51.360 --> 1:42:53.120
 I mean they express so much

1:42:53.120 --> 1:42:55.920
 the face the eyes the body

1:42:55.920 --> 1:42:57.360
 I mean Lisa talks about that

1:42:57.360 --> 1:42:59.040
 the communication of emotions

1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:00.960
 it's a super complex

1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:02.640
 perhaps there's a bit of a

1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:04.960
 side fun tangent but

1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:09.360
 Matt Matthew Johnson brings up DMT

1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:12.720
 and the experience of DMT is a

1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:16.080
 from a scientific perspective

1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:16.240
 just a

1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:18.560
 just a mystery in itself

1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:20.240
 over its intensity

1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:21.680
 what happens to the brain

1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:22.640
 and of course

1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:24.080
 Joe

1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:25.200
 Rogan and others

1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:26.000
 bring it up as a

1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:28.720
 very different

1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:30.080
 special kind of experience

1:43:31.760 --> 1:43:33.680
 the end elves seem to come up off

1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:36.080
 I've never tried DMT

1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:38.320
 what allows for hallucinogenic states

1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:38.640
 yes

1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:39.120
 and it

1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:41.920
 I mean DMT is a really interesting molecule

1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:43.760
 there there are a lot of people

1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:44.720
 experimenting now

1:43:45.360 --> 1:43:46.960
 with DMT

1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:48.560
 and

1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:50.160
 they just

1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:52.000
 the way they've described it

1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:52.640
 is

1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:54.640
 as a kind of a freight train

1:43:54.640 --> 1:43:56.000
 through space and time

1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:56.960
 very different than the way

1:43:56.960 --> 1:43:58.880
 people describe LSD type experiences

1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:00.240
 or psilocybin where

1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:02.000
 time and space are very fluid

1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:03.280
 but it tends to be a kind of a

1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:04.160
 slower

1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:05.040
 role if you will

1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:08.800
 so it's clear that DMT is tapping

1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:10.160
 into a brain state

1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:11.840
 that's distinctly different

1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:13.200
 than the other psychedelics

1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:14.000
 and

1:44:14.960 --> 1:44:16.560
 and you mentioned jujitsu

1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:17.760
 and these other communities

1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:18.880
 I mean it's

1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:19.920
 I think it's

1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:20.960
 interesting because

1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:23.360
 jujitsu is a nonverbal activity

1:44:23.360 --> 1:44:24.160
 and people get together

1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:24.880
 and talk about this

1:44:24.880 --> 1:44:26.320
 nonverbal activity

1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:27.600
 and they show great love for it

1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:29.360
 in the same way that surfers

1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:29.680
 you know

1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:31.920
 I've known some surfers in my time

1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:34.880
 and they will get up at the crack of dawn

1:44:34.880 --> 1:44:36.240
 and drive really really far

1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:36.960
 to sit in the water

1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:38.080
 and wait for this wave to come

1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:39.920
 I have to imagine it's pretty fantastic

1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:41.280
 I think that

1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:43.360
 human beings now

1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:46.320
 some of whom are in the scientific community

1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:47.920
 are starting to feel comfortable enough

1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:49.600
 to talk about some of these

1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:51.280
 other loves and other endeavors

1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:52.160
 because

1:44:52.160 --> 1:44:53.920
 they do reveal a certain component

1:44:53.920 --> 1:44:55.760
 about our underlying neurology

1:44:55.760 --> 1:44:56.880
 I'm fascinated by

1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:00.240
 the concept of wordlessness

1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:02.000
 activities in which

1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:05.520
 language is just not sufficient to capture

1:45:06.080 --> 1:45:06.560
 and in which

1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:08.640
 feel so vital

1:45:08.640 --> 1:45:09.440
 as a reset

1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:10.720
 as important as sleep

1:45:11.280 --> 1:45:12.640
 you know I think that's one of the dangers

1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:13.200
 of the phone

1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:15.280
 is not that you're going to get into some online battle

1:45:15.280 --> 1:45:16.560
 or that you're always staring at the phone

1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:16.960
 is that

1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:17.680
 it's a word

1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:18.560
 so as we read things

1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:20.640
 we're hearing the script in our head

1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:22.720
 and I think getting into states

1:45:23.440 --> 1:45:25.680
 where we are in a state of wordlessness

1:45:26.400 --> 1:45:28.400
 is very renewing

1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:29.360
 and replenishing

1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:31.520
 and just can feel amazing

1:45:31.520 --> 1:45:32.800
 for and I believe

1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:34.160
 also can help us tap into

1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:35.920
 creative states

1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:38.640
 and allow our neurology to access creative states

1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:41.040
 and sleep is one such wordlessness

1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:42.080
 period

1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:42.880
 so

1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:45.760
 one of the most interesting things to me

1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:47.680
 are states that one can approach

1:45:47.680 --> 1:45:48.880
 in waking non sleep

1:45:48.880 --> 1:45:50.000
 depressed

1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:51.200
 wordlessness

1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:51.680
 through

1:45:51.680 --> 1:45:52.640
 maybe it's jiu jitsu

1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:54.080
 maybe it's for some people surfing

1:45:54.080 --> 1:45:55.120
 maybe it's dancing

1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:56.080
 maybe it's just

1:45:56.080 --> 1:45:57.200
 I don't know staring at a wall

1:45:57.200 --> 1:45:58.160
 who knows

1:45:58.160 --> 1:45:59.360
 but where the

1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:02.320
 language components of the brain are completely shut down

1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:04.560
 and it has to be the case

1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:05.920
 that drugs are no drugs

1:46:06.480 --> 1:46:08.080
 that the brain is entering

1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:09.600
 and starting to

1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:10.480
 states

1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:12.000
 and starting to use algorithms

1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000
 that are distinctly different than when we're trying to

1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:16.560
 compose things in any kind of coherent way

1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:17.680
 for someone else to understand

1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:19.280
 there's no interest in anyone else

1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:21.520
 understanding what you're experiencing in that moment

1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:23.440
 and that's beautiful

1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:23.920
 and I think

1:46:25.200 --> 1:46:26.400
 I think it's not just beautiful

1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:27.600
 because it feels good

1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:29.600
 I think it's beautiful because it's important

1:46:29.600 --> 1:46:32.000
 and it's clearly fundamental to our neurology

1:46:32.640 --> 1:46:34.160
 and your sense is

1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:35.680
 there's a connection between dreams

1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:37.040
 and DMT and like second doubt

1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:37.760
 like all of the

1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:40.000
 you can

1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:41.520
 you can understand one

1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:42.560
 by studying the other

1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:44.080
 so for example dreams

1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:46.160
 are also very difficult to study right

1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:48.160
 but they're more accessible

1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:49.120
 it's safe for the study

1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:51.760
 and we're told we need to get more of it

1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:52.880
 whereas with psychedelics

1:46:52.880 --> 1:46:54.240
 there's this big question mark

1:46:54.240 --> 1:46:56.240
 is it going to make everyone crazy

1:46:56.240 --> 1:46:56.800
 is it

1:46:56.800 --> 1:46:57.920
 is it going to be legal

1:46:57.920 --> 1:46:58.480
 I mean

1:46:58.480 --> 1:46:59.520
 it's kind of interesting how

1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:01.760
 if one looks on Instagram

1:47:02.320 --> 1:47:04.720
 one could almost think that these drugs are already legal

1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:05.840
 based on the way that people commute

1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:06.720
 but they're not yet

1:47:06.720 --> 1:47:08.160
 there's still a lot of them are scheduling

1:47:08.160 --> 1:47:09.280
 there's a lot of questions

1:47:10.400 --> 1:47:11.040
 I mean

1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:12.640
 and but nevertheless

1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:13.200
 it's like

1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:15.840
 my my hope is that

1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:18.240
 science opens up to these

1:47:19.520 --> 1:47:20.880
 drugs a little bit more

1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:21.360
 it's just

1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:22.640
 I have this intuition that

1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:24.960
 and like a lot of people share

1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:26.720
 that they would be able to

1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:29.920
 unlock deeper understanding

1:47:29.920 --> 1:47:30.880
 of our own mind

1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:31.920
 it's any kind of

1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:33.760
 same as studying dreams

1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:34.640
 absolutely

1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:37.040
 well creativity is in the nonlinearities

1:47:37.040 --> 1:47:38.000
 right

1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.480
 but productivity is in the

1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:42.240
 implementation of linearities

1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:43.600
 I mean that's

1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:44.640
 that's what

1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:45.600
 is absolutely clear

1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:47.680
 this is why I think we were talking earlier about

1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:49.760
 why a formal rigorous training in something

1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:51.120
 where other people are looking at you

1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:52.480
 and telling you no not good enough

1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:53.840
 go back and do it again

1:47:53.840 --> 1:47:55.200
 there's real value to that

1:47:55.200 --> 1:47:56.960
 because otherwise it's just ideas

1:47:56.960 --> 1:47:57.760
 it's just vapors

1:47:58.400 --> 1:47:58.960
 you know

1:47:58.960 --> 1:48:01.120
 one thing that Matt mentioned

1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:03.120
 as the study that they're working on

1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:05.440
 is as opposed to

1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:07.520
 I think most of the psychedelic studies

1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:08.080
 they've done

1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:10.000
 is on

1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:11.920
 how to treat different conditions

1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:13.520
 and one of the things they're working on now

1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:15.040
 is to try to do a study where

1:48:16.800 --> 1:48:18.000
 for creatives

1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:19.600
 for people that don't have a

1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:20.880
 condition to try and treat

1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:21.440
 but instead

1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:23.040
 see how this

1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:25.840
 how psychedelics can help you create

1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:26.400
 so like

1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:26.960
 goodness

1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:27.920
 if you take creatives

1:48:27.920 --> 1:48:29.520
 and you give them more psychedelics

1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:31.520
 they're not going to be able to get out of there right

1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:32.560
 I don't know

1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:33.680
 well but this is the

1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:35.360
 I maybe can speak to that

1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:37.200
 psychedelics are not

1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:38.800
 or dreams or tools in general

1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:40.480
 how to be better creatives

1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:41.920
 that's an interesting

1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:45.360
 I don't often see studies of this nature of like

1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:46.960
 how to take high performance

1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:48.480
 in the mental

1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:50.720
 creative space

1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:52.240
 and get them to perform even

1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:53.520
 better

1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:54.880
 so it's not average people

1:48:55.600 --> 1:48:57.600
 it's like masters of their craft

1:48:57.600 --> 1:48:58.720
 like taking

1:48:58.720 --> 1:48:59.920
 I mean his examples was

1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:01.280
 taking an Elon Musk

1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:03.040
 which is in the engineering space

1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:04.080
 and maybe musicians

1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:05.440
 and all that kind of stuff

1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:06.400
 and studying that

1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:06.880
 that's a

1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:09.120
 I mean that's weird

1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:11.760
 I usually the science

1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:13.600
 the scientific exploration there

1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:15.120
 has been done in

1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:16.640
 by the musicians themselves

1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:17.760
 as has been documented

1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:19.040
 like jazz is like

1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:20.880
 all non linearities

1:49:20.880 --> 1:49:21.280
 yeah

1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:22.160
 but if it's

1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:23.520
 but the people still have to know

1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:25.120
 how to play their instruments

1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:25.600
 right right

1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:26.880
 there's some early

1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:28.400
 early skill building

1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:29.440
 that's critical

1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:29.760
 I mean

1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:30.960
 when you

1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:32.000
 manage someone like Elon

1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:32.720
 I mean virtual

1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:34.480
 I mean he's already a virtual so right

1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:36.320
 because he and in so many different domains

1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:37.360
 I've never met him

1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:38.000
 but it's

1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:39.280
 it's clear right

1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:40.080
 he

1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:41.760
 it's not just that he's ambitious

1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:42.240
 and bold

1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:42.720
 and brave

1:49:42.720 --> 1:49:43.200
 and all that

1:49:43.200 --> 1:49:44.240
 it's all that

1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:44.480
 and

1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:45.520
 there's

1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:47.120
 there's clearly

1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:49.520
 a different way of looking at the same

1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:51.440
 problems that everyone else is looking at

1:49:51.440 --> 1:49:52.560
 and people are probably

1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:54.000
 banging their head against the refrigerators

1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:55.040
 and like think differently

1:49:55.040 --> 1:49:56.720
 things it doesn't work that way

1:49:56.720 --> 1:49:57.360
 it involved

1:49:57.360 --> 1:49:58.960
 there's a certain anxiety in

1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:00.240
 for the

1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:01.360
 I'm not talking about for Elon

1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:02.480
 but I don't have no idea

1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:05.840
 but I think for somebody who's

1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:06.640
 very structured

1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:07.520
 very regimented

1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:08.480
 very linear

1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:10.560
 the anxiety comes from letting go of those

1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:11.360
 linearities

1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:12.480
 and

1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:13.920
 for the person that's very creative

1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:15.120
 the anxiety comes from

1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:17.760
 trying to impose linearities

1:50:17.760 --> 1:50:18.160
 right

1:50:18.160 --> 1:50:18.800
 the

1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:20.480
 really creative artists or musician

1:50:21.120 --> 1:50:21.600
 they're

1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:22.720
 they seem nuts

1:50:22.720 --> 1:50:24.400
 they seem like they can't get their life together

1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:25.200
 because they can't

1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:26.640
 and they

1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:27.920
 you know we look at people who are kind of

1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:30.000
 pseudo ass burgers or ass burgers

1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:31.200
 or some forms of autism

1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:32.960
 and they are so hyper linear

1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:34.480
 but you take away those linearities

1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:35.440
 and they freak out

1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:36.960
 and that's kind of the

1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:38.960
 essence of some of those syndromes

1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:39.680
 so I think that

1:50:40.560 --> 1:50:42.560
 the ability to toggle back and forth between

1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:44.000
 those states is what's remarkable

1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:44.560
 I mean

1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:45.280
 because we're here

1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:46.240
 and we're having this discussion

1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:48.080
 I mean Steve Jobs is a good example

1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:48.720
 he

1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:49.840
 probably the best example

1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:51.520
 somebody who actually talked about his own

1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:52.560
 process

1:50:52.560 --> 1:50:54.800
 about the merging of art and science

1:50:54.800 --> 1:50:56.080
 art and engineering

1:50:56.080 --> 1:50:57.840
 humanities and science

1:50:57.840 --> 1:50:59.280
 very few people can do that

1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:00.720
 well I

1:51:00.720 --> 1:51:02.720
 you seem to have a capacity to do that

1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:03.440
 I'd like you

1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:04.800
 you know poetry

1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:06.240
 and you are AI guy

1:51:06.240 --> 1:51:07.040
 like you

1:51:07.040 --> 1:51:08.560
 there's nothing linear about poetry

1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:09.600
 as far as I can tell

1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:10.320
 I mean I

1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:11.120
 I do wonder

1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:12.560
 just like we've been talking about

1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:14.160
 if there's any ways to push that

1:51:14.160 --> 1:51:15.680
 to its limits to

1:51:15.680 --> 1:51:16.640
 explore further

1:51:17.520 --> 1:51:18.640
 I don't like leaning

1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:18.960
 this

1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:20.160
 this is why I'm bothered

1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:21.920
 there's not more science and psychedelics

1:51:21.920 --> 1:51:22.320
 is

1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:23.520
 I haven't done

1:51:23.520 --> 1:51:24.560
 almost

1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:25.040
 so I've

1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:26.560
 eaten

1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:27.600
 mushrooms a few times

1:51:28.560 --> 1:51:29.200
 allegedly

1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:30.560
 but that's it

1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:31.600
 you know

1:51:31.600 --> 1:51:32.080
 and I

1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:33.360
 the reason I don't do more

1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:34.960
 the reason I haven't done DMT

1:51:34.960 --> 1:51:36.320
 is because it's illegal

1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:38.800
 and it's like not well studied

1:51:39.440 --> 1:51:40.160
 and it

1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:40.480
 you know

1:51:41.120 --> 1:51:42.400
 I'm in those things

1:51:42.400 --> 1:51:44.000
 and I'm not usually at the cutting edge

1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:45.200
 but I'm very curious

1:51:45.200 --> 1:51:46.080
 and it feels like

1:51:47.920 --> 1:51:49.360
 there could be tools

1:51:49.360 --> 1:51:50.480
 to be discovered there

1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:51.840
 not for fun

1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:52.960
 not for recreation

1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:54.720
 but for like

1:51:56.160 --> 1:51:57.200
 encouraging

1:51:57.200 --> 1:51:58.240
 whether you're linear

1:51:58.240 --> 1:51:59.920
 thinking to go nonlinear

1:51:59.920 --> 1:52:01.680
 or it's nonlinear to go linear

1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:03.360
 like to to shake things up

1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:04.960
 you mentioned Dan Gable

1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:06.800
 the idea of Dan Gable on psychedelics

1:52:06.800 --> 1:52:07.680
 is fascinating to me

1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:08.560
 because

1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:09.200
 he's such

1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:11.040
 a control freak

1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:11.920
 I mean

1:52:11.920 --> 1:52:12.800
 he likes control

1:52:12.800 --> 1:52:13.520
 that I would show up for

1:52:13.520 --> 1:52:13.920
 that

1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:15.120
 that would not show up for

1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:17.520
 but like so much of these psychedelic experiences

1:52:17.520 --> 1:52:18.560
 it feels like

1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:18.960
 is

1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:19.760
 are letting go

1:52:19.760 --> 1:52:20.000
 that's right

1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:21.120
 you don't want to resist

1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:21.840
 but that's supposed

1:52:21.840 --> 1:52:23.280
 supposedly where the growth is

1:52:23.840 --> 1:52:25.120
 in in giving

1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:26.720
 oneself over to the process

1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:28.080
 and that's

1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:29.200
 for people who are

1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:31.200
 like master controllers

1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:33.040
 he's one of the greatest coaches of all time

1:52:33.040 --> 1:52:35.680
 it's fascinating to see what that battle looks like

1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:36.560
 of resistance

1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:37.520
 and then of letting go

1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:39.200
 yeah I mean

1:52:39.200 --> 1:52:40.640
 I I can't wait to

1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:43.920
 to see where these studies takes us

1:52:43.920 --> 1:52:45.360
 what's clearly happening

1:52:45.360 --> 1:52:46.080
 you know I've asked

1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:47.600
 there I have a couple of colleagues at Stanford

1:52:47.600 --> 1:52:49.280
 who are doing animal studies

1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:50.320
 I've asked around

1:52:50.320 --> 1:52:51.280
 you know it's

1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:52.880
 there's a lot of discussion

1:52:52.880 --> 1:52:54.160
 in the neuroscience community

1:52:54.160 --> 1:52:56.720
 about what the perception of a laboratory is

1:52:56.720 --> 1:52:57.200
 if they

1:52:57.920 --> 1:52:59.360
 don't work on psychedelics

1:52:59.360 --> 1:52:59.680
 I mean

1:53:00.480 --> 1:53:01.600
 I have to tip my hat

1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:02.720
 to the folks at Hopkins

1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:04.080
 they are pioneers

1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:05.040
 and as

1:53:05.040 --> 1:53:05.920
 Terry Szygnowski

1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:07.600
 he's a computational neuroscientist

1:53:07.600 --> 1:53:08.480
 down at Salk says

1:53:08.480 --> 1:53:10.560
 I don't think he was the first person to say he says

1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:11.840
 you know how to spot the pioneers

1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:14.480
 they're the ones with the arrows in their backs

1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:15.040
 yeah

1:53:15.040 --> 1:53:16.160
 and you know it's

1:53:16.160 --> 1:53:17.440
 it's an unkind world

1:53:18.240 --> 1:53:19.760
 to a scientist

1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:20.720
 that's trying to do

1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:21.920
 really cutting edge stuff

1:53:21.920 --> 1:53:22.640
 my colleague

1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:23.200
 David Spiegel

1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:24.800
 who studies medical hypnosis

1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:25.440
 it's he's got

1:53:26.080 --> 1:53:27.280
 dozens of studies now

1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:28.000
 showing that

1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:29.360
 hypnosis can be beneficial

1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:30.320
 for pain management

1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:31.280
 anxiety management

1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:32.480
 cancer outcomes

1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:33.600
 and it's finally

1:53:33.600 --> 1:53:34.160
 you know

1:53:34.160 --> 1:53:35.200
 at the point where

1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:36.720
 there's so much data

1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:38.000
 but people hear hypnosis

1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:39.200
 and they think of stage hypnosis

1:53:39.200 --> 1:53:40.320
 which is like the furthest thing

1:53:40.320 --> 1:53:41.200
 from what he's doing

1:53:41.920 --> 1:53:42.640
 and

1:53:42.640 --> 1:53:43.040
 I think

1:53:43.920 --> 1:53:44.960
 mind body

1:53:44.960 --> 1:53:45.600
 type stuff

1:53:45.600 --> 1:53:46.320
 hypnosis

1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:47.760
 respiration

1:53:47.760 --> 1:53:48.320
 and breathing

1:53:48.320 --> 1:53:49.600
 I think the hard science

1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:52.480
 walk into the problem

1:53:52.480 --> 1:53:53.680
 is always going to be best

1:53:53.680 --> 1:53:55.200
 to get the community on board

1:53:55.840 --> 1:53:56.400
 and then

1:53:56.400 --> 1:53:58.000
 it's up to people like Matt

1:53:58.000 --> 1:53:58.160
 and

1:53:59.280 --> 1:54:00.240
 to really

1:54:00.240 --> 1:54:01.600
 you know take it to the next level

1:54:01.600 --> 1:54:02.640
 and as I say not

1:54:02.640 --> 1:54:03.680
 Keesey out of the game

1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:04.880
 because Keesey basically

1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:06.320
 was taken too much

1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:07.120
 of his own stuff

1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:08.000
 and he started dressing

1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:09.280
 crazy of banana hats

1:54:09.280 --> 1:54:09.920
 and like you see him

1:54:09.920 --> 1:54:11.600
 he had the magic bus

1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:12.480
 so you know the day

1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:13.600
 so like the day I start

1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:14.240
 driving to work

1:54:14.240 --> 1:54:15.440
 in the magic bus

1:54:15.440 --> 1:54:16.880
 that's the day I lose my job

1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:17.520
 where you're gonna

1:54:17.520 --> 1:54:18.480
 I'm not into buses

1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:19.600
 or or or

1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:20.480
 wearing fruit

1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:20.880
 but um

1:54:20.880 --> 1:54:21.840
 you're gonna get a phone call

1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:22.240
 for me

1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:23.520
 and I hope you do the same for me

1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:23.840
 it's like

1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:25.200
 like

1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:25.920
 dude what are you doing

1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:27.600
 well what's interesting

1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:28.320
 earlier we're talking about

1:54:28.320 --> 1:54:29.360
 the challenge with David

1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:30.480
 that you're about to do

1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:30.800
 I mean

1:54:30.800 --> 1:54:34.000
 that is a psychedelic experience

1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:34.480
 of sorts

1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:36.080
 because you're biasing your mind

1:54:36.080 --> 1:54:37.200
 towards a pretty extreme

1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:38.560
 neurochemical state

1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:39.440
 and you don't know

1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:40.560
 what you're gonna find there

1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:42.000
 and that's kind of the excitement

1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:42.560
 at least for me

1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:43.520
 as an observer

1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:43.920
 it's like

1:54:43.920 --> 1:54:44.640
 I want to know

1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:45.600
 what

1:54:46.480 --> 1:54:47.600
 what the experience

1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:48.000
 is like

1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:49.360
 afterward

1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:50.400
 I want to know like

1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:50.960
 how was it

1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:51.600
 I mean I'm sure

1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:52.560
 you're gonna get something

1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:52.960
 like you said

1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:53.760
 you're gonna grow

1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:54.720
 the question is how

1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:55.680
 and not resisting

1:54:55.680 --> 1:54:56.400
 I mean it's the same as

1:54:56.400 --> 1:54:57.680
 with a psychedelic experience

1:54:57.680 --> 1:54:58.240
 it's like

1:54:58.240 --> 1:54:58.480
 not

1:54:59.360 --> 1:54:59.920
 like

1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:01.360
 giving yourself over completely

1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:02.160
 to the experience

1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:03.280
 and not resisting

1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:03.760
 and going through

1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:04.880
 the whole mental journey

1:55:04.880 --> 1:55:05.600
 of whether it's

1:55:06.320 --> 1:55:06.960
 anger

1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:07.920
 or excitement

1:55:07.920 --> 1:55:08.560
 or exhaustion

1:55:08.560 --> 1:55:09.120
 the whole thing

1:55:09.760 --> 1:55:10.400
 it's uh

1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:11.520
 I mean

1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:13.360
 that's

1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:15.520
 the entirety

1:55:15.520 --> 1:55:16.480
 of the process

1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:17.760
 that David goes through

1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:18.320
 when he does

1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:19.520
 his own challenges

1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:20.320
 and so on

1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:21.280
 is that whole journey

1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:22.640
 he finds purposely

1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:23.440
 like

1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:25.360
 missile seeks

1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:27.120
 the limits of the mind

1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:27.920
 that that

1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:29.600
 whatever the resistance

1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:30.480
 is felt

1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:31.760
 runs up against it

1:55:31.760 --> 1:55:32.400
 and then goes to

1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:33.200
 the full journey

1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:34.400
 of going beyond it

1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:34.960
 and seeing

1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:35.600
 what's there

1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:36.400
 on the other side

1:55:36.400 --> 1:55:37.360
 well stress has these

1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:37.920
 two sides

1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:38.880
 the limbic friction

1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:39.920
 of being tired

1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:40.720
 and needing to get

1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:41.520
 more energized

1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:42.880
 that's one form of stress

1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:44.480
 and then there's the

1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:45.440
 feeling too amped up

1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:46.800
 and needing to calm down

1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:47.920
 the typical

1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:48.800
 discussion around stress

1:55:48.800 --> 1:55:50.000
 is one thing

1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:51.600
 but it's all limbic friction

1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:52.240
 it's just that

1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:53.440
 when I say limbic friction

1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:54.080
 that's not a real

1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:54.720
 scientific term

1:55:54.720 --> 1:55:55.040
 I just mean

1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:55.920
 the limbic system

1:55:55.920 --> 1:55:57.040
 wanting to pull you down

1:55:57.040 --> 1:55:57.520
 into sleep

1:55:57.520 --> 1:55:58.400
 or wanting to put you

1:55:58.400 --> 1:55:59.200
 into panic

1:55:59.200 --> 1:55:59.920
 and you

1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:00.640
 using

1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:01.600
 top down processing

1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:02.480
 using that

1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:03.040
 evolved

1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:04.640
 forebrained to say

1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:06.720
 I'm not going to go to sleep

1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:08.960
 and I'm not going to freak out

1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:09.760
 and those top down

1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:10.960
 control mechanisms are

1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:13.040
 I mean when those get honed

1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:15.040
 that's beautiful

1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:15.840
 because then you

1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:17.120
 you're increasing

1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:18.400
 capacity for everything

1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:19.840
 you

1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:20.800
 uh

1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:22.160
 this month on the podcast

1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:22.720
 you're talking about

1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:23.600
 neuroplasticity

1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:24.000
 you mentioned

1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:25.120
 in a bunch already

1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:26.080
 is there something you're

1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:28.160
 looking forward to

1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:28.960
 specifically

1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:29.680
 like

1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:30.480
 something maybe you're

1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:31.760
 fascinated by

1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:33.040
 that jumps to mind

1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:34.560
 about neuroplasticity

1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:35.840
 this fascinating

1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:36.800
 property of the brain

1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:38.240
 yeah I think that

1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:39.840
 it's clear there's

1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:41.760
 one facet of neuroplasticity

1:56:41.760 --> 1:56:43.440
 that is very well supported

1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:45.280
 by the research data

1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:46.560
 that hardly anyone

1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:47.840
 is implemented

1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:48.800
 in the real world

1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:49.680
 and that's the release

1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:50.560
 of acetylcholine

1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:51.440
 from these neurons

1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:52.080
 in the forebrained

1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:53.520
 called nucleus basalis

1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:54.640
 this is mainly the work

1:56:54.640 --> 1:56:55.840
 of Mike Mersenek

1:56:55.840 --> 1:56:57.280
 who used to be at UCSF

1:56:57.280 --> 1:56:58.480
 and some of his scientific

1:56:58.480 --> 1:56:59.920
 offspring Greg Reckon's own

1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:01.040
 and Michael Kilgard

1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:01.360
 and others

1:57:01.360 --> 1:57:02.160
 what they showed was

1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:04.720
 increases in acetylcholine

1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:05.760
 this molecule

1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:06.800
 associated with focus

1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:08.320
 in concert

1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:10.000
 meaning at the same time

1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:10.560
 is some

1:57:11.200 --> 1:57:11.920
 event

1:57:11.920 --> 1:57:12.880
 motor event

1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:14.080
 or music event

1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:15.040
 or any kind of

1:57:15.600 --> 1:57:16.320
 sensory event

1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:17.840
 immediately

1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:20.400
 reorganizes the neocortex

1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:21.600
 so that there's a permanent

1:57:21.600 --> 1:57:22.640
 map representation

1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:23.280
 of that event

1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:24.400
 and I

1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:26.000
 I absolutely believe

1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:27.360
 that this can be channeled

1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:28.640
 toward accelerated skill

1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:29.040
 learning

1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:30.800
 and my friend and colleague

1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:31.360
 Eddie Chang

1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:32.080
 who's now the

1:57:32.640 --> 1:57:33.440
 chair of neurosurgery

1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:34.640
 at UCSF

1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:36.080
 but also a fine scientist

1:57:36.080 --> 1:57:36.800
 in his own right

1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:38.720
 not just a clinician

1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:39.200
 he's doing

1:57:39.840 --> 1:57:40.560
 studies looking at

1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:42.000
 rapid acquisition of language

1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:43.520
 using these principles

1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:44.560
 he trained with Mersenek

1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:46.960
 it's clear we have these

1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:48.000
 gates on plasticity

1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:48.800
 in the forebrained

1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:50.800
 and they are gated by

1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:52.080
 nicotinic acetylcholine

1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:53.600
 transmission

1:57:53.600 --> 1:57:55.520
 and why that hasn't made it

1:57:55.520 --> 1:57:56.880
 into protocols

1:57:56.880 --> 1:57:57.600
 for

1:57:57.600 --> 1:57:58.240
 motor learning

1:57:58.240 --> 1:57:58.800
 sport learning

1:57:58.800 --> 1:57:59.440
 language learning

1:57:59.440 --> 1:58:00.320
 music learning

1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:01.520
 emotional learning

1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:02.400
 I don't know

1:58:02.400 --> 1:58:03.600
 I think part of the reason

1:58:03.600 --> 1:58:04.240
 has been

1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:05.440
 kind of cultural

1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:06.240
 is that scientists

1:58:06.240 --> 1:58:07.040
 publish their paper

1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:07.760
 and they move on

1:58:07.760 --> 1:58:08.240
 Mersenek

1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:09.520
 talked a lot

1:58:09.520 --> 1:58:10.240
 and still

1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:10.880
 can be found

1:58:10.880 --> 1:58:11.600
 from time to time

1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:12.240
 talking about

1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:13.920
 how these

1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:15.040
 plasticity mechanisms

1:58:15.040 --> 1:58:15.920
 can be leveraged

1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:16.800
 but

1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:18.800
 he had a commercial company

1:58:18.800 --> 1:58:19.600
 and so then people

1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:20.320
 kind of backed away

1:58:20.320 --> 1:58:21.200
 from it a little bit

1:58:21.200 --> 1:58:21.920
 I think he was

1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:22.640
 to be honest

1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:23.200
 I think

1:58:23.200 --> 1:58:25.120
 Mersenek was ahead of his time

1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:26.160
 and I think the timing is

1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:26.800
 right now

1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:28.720
 for people to understand

1:58:28.720 --> 1:58:29.520
 these mechanisms

1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:30.240
 of plasticity

1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:31.520
 and start to implement them

1:58:31.520 --> 1:58:31.920
 also

1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:32.160
 you know

1:58:32.160 --> 1:58:32.880
 it all sounds like

1:58:32.880 --> 1:58:34.080
 becoming superhuman

1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:34.960
 or optimizing

1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:35.840
 or whatever

1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:36.400
 all that

1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:36.880
 yes

1:58:36.880 --> 1:58:37.280
 but also

1:58:37.280 --> 1:58:37.920
 what about kids

1:58:37.920 --> 1:58:38.880
 with language

1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:39.600
 learning deficits

1:58:39.600 --> 1:58:40.880
 or with dyslexia

1:58:40.880 --> 1:58:42.480
 or just performance

1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:43.600
 in school in general

1:58:43.600 --> 1:58:44.880
 I mean I have a deep

1:58:44.880 --> 1:58:46.160
 interesting concern

1:58:46.160 --> 1:58:47.520
 for the future of science

1:58:47.520 --> 1:58:48.400
 and mathematics

1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:49.280
 and in

1:58:49.280 --> 1:58:50.160
 not just in this country

1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:51.520
 but all over the world

1:58:51.520 --> 1:58:53.200
 and more plasticity

1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:54.400
 equals faster

1:58:54.400 --> 1:58:56.000
 better deeper learning

1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:57.920
 and if we don't do this

1:58:57.920 --> 1:58:58.880
 I don't think we're going to get

1:58:58.880 --> 1:59:00.400
 the full reach

1:59:00.400 --> 1:59:01.200
 out of all the

1:59:01.200 --> 1:59:02.960
 machine learning tools either

1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:03.760
 because

1:59:03.760 --> 1:59:05.520
 everyone talks about these huge data sets

1:59:05.520 --> 1:59:05.840
 and

1:59:05.840 --> 1:59:06.960
 but those huge data sets

1:59:06.960 --> 1:59:09.280
 funnel into human interpretation

1:59:09.280 --> 1:59:10.080
 I mean we don't just like

1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:11.040
 stare at the numbers

1:59:11.040 --> 1:59:12.240
 and bask right

1:59:12.240 --> 1:59:13.360
 so some

1:59:13.360 --> 1:59:14.240
 the human brain

1:59:14.240 --> 1:59:15.680
 I think needs to

1:59:15.680 --> 1:59:16.400
 leverage these

1:59:16.400 --> 1:59:17.440
 plasticity mechanisms

1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:18.560
 to keep up with

1:59:18.560 --> 1:59:19.440
 the thing that's happening

1:59:19.440 --> 1:59:20.080
 very very fast

1:59:20.080 --> 1:59:21.600
 which is technology development

1:59:21.600 --> 1:59:23.040
 so that's a long winded way of saying

1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:24.800
 basal forebrain

1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:26.080
 colonergic transmission

1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:26.880
 and plasticity

1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:27.440
 it

1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:28.960
 allows for plasticity in adulthood

1:59:28.960 --> 1:59:30.160
 and it allows for

1:59:30.160 --> 1:59:31.440
 single trial learning

1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:32.560
 which is incredible

1:59:33.200 --> 1:59:33.600
 but

1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:34.880
 how do we leverage that

1:59:34.880 --> 1:59:35.440
 like

1:59:35.440 --> 1:59:36.240
 in the

1:59:36.240 --> 1:59:38.000
 physical space taking actions

1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:39.200
 or is there some chemicals

1:59:39.200 --> 1:59:40.240
 that can stimulate

1:59:42.720 --> 1:59:44.320
 stimulate neuroplasticity

1:59:44.320 --> 1:59:44.720
 like what

1:59:44.720 --> 1:59:46.640
 I think it's the intersection of the two

1:59:46.640 --> 1:59:47.680
 I think it's being engaged

1:59:47.680 --> 1:59:48.800
 in a physical practice

1:59:48.800 --> 1:59:50.720
 while enhancing pharmacology

1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:52.080
 and it has to be done safely

1:59:52.080 --> 1:59:53.920
 and this is full of open questions

1:59:53.920 --> 1:59:55.120
 this is the very beginnings

1:59:55.120 --> 1:59:56.480
 of it like you're saying

1:59:56.480 --> 1:59:57.840
 yeah a pill

1:59:57.840 --> 1:59:58.800
 that's safe

1:59:58.800 --> 1:59:59.440
 that increases

1:59:59.440 --> 2:00:00.560
 nicotinic transmission

2:00:00.560 --> 2:00:01.520
 I mean I know a number of people

2:00:01.520 --> 2:00:02.880
 that chew Nicorette

2:00:02.880 --> 2:00:03.920
 actually I have a

2:00:03.920 --> 2:00:05.440
 Nobel Prize winning colleague

2:00:05.440 --> 2:00:06.080
 at

2:00:06.080 --> 2:00:06.800
 Columbia

2:00:06.800 --> 2:00:07.520
 not to be named

2:00:08.240 --> 2:00:09.840
 who chews like six pieces of Nicorette

2:00:09.840 --> 2:00:11.760
 and a half hour conversation with him

2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:12.720
 and he

2:00:12.720 --> 2:00:14.160
 started doing that as a replacement

2:00:14.160 --> 2:00:14.800
 for smoking

2:00:14.800 --> 2:00:16.160
 because smoking

2:00:16.160 --> 2:00:18.080
 is nicotine, nicotinic stimulation

2:00:18.080 --> 2:00:18.800
 of the

2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:19.760
 colonergic system

2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:21.440
 so smokers have long known

2:00:21.440 --> 2:00:22.640
 that increases focus

2:00:22.640 --> 2:00:23.200
 and attention

2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:24.000
 and learning

2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:25.600
 it's just that the lung cancer thing

2:00:25.600 --> 2:00:26.960
 is a barrier

2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:28.240
 now I'm not suggesting people

2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:28.960
 take Nicorette

2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:30.000
 but it's clear that

2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:30.960
 we need

2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:32.720
 better directed pharmacology

2:00:32.720 --> 2:00:33.280
 but

2:00:33.280 --> 2:00:34.240
 you can imagine next time

2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:35.520
 you go in for a learning bout

2:00:35.520 --> 2:00:36.560
 if it's really essential

2:00:37.360 --> 2:00:38.480
 you might want to stimulate

2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:39.680
 the nicotinic system

2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:40.800
 if that's safe for you

2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:42.400
 again I'm a doctor

2:00:42.400 --> 2:00:43.600
 so again I'm not telling people

2:00:43.600 --> 2:00:44.080
 to do this

2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:45.680
 but that's where it's going

2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:46.880
 until we start merging

2:00:46.880 --> 2:00:48.320
 machines with pharmacology

2:00:48.320 --> 2:00:48.960
 and behavior

2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:50.480
 it's

2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:51.280
 it

2:00:51.280 --> 2:00:52.480
 we're just kind of walking around

2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:54.320
 in the circle over and over again

2:00:54.320 --> 2:00:55.200
 and it's going to happen

2:00:56.400 --> 2:00:57.600
 do you find

2:00:57.600 --> 2:00:58.400
 computer vision

2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:00.160
 machine learning

2:01:01.280 --> 2:01:03.520
 from the perspective of tooling

2:01:03.520 --> 2:01:04.880
 as an interesting tool for

2:01:06.320 --> 2:01:07.120
 analyzing

2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:08.080
 for processing

2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:08.720
 all the data

2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:10.160
 from the neuroscience world

2:01:10.160 --> 2:01:10.880
 from the

2:01:10.880 --> 2:01:11.840
 neurobiology

2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:12.880
 biology

2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:13.680
 the camera

2:01:13.680 --> 2:01:14.960
 all the different data sets

2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:15.600
 that you can have

2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:16.480
 about the mind

2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:17.040
 the eye

2:01:17.040 --> 2:01:17.280
 the

2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:20.880
 everything that's neck and above

2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:22.240
 and also the central nervous system

2:01:22.240 --> 2:01:22.640
 and all

2:01:23.440 --> 2:01:24.080
 absolutely

2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:24.640
 I mean

2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:25.280
 I think that

2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:27.520
 computer science and engineering

2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:28.560
 and chemistry

2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:29.680
 bioengineering is

2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:31.920
 that's what's creating

2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:33.760
 the acceleration and progress

2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:34.960
 in neuroscience right now

2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:37.280
 I think it's actually one place

2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:37.920
 where

2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:38.560
 science

2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:39.680
 I'm very reassured

2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:40.240
 science has

2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:42.320
 been invited in

2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:43.120
 psychologists

2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:44.240
 computational biologists

2:01:44.240 --> 2:01:45.120
 at least at Stanford

2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:45.600
 MIT

2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:46.000
 and

2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:47.200
 and other places too

2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:48.000
 of course

2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:49.360
 it's clear that

2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:49.920
 it's a

2:01:49.920 --> 2:01:52.000
 everyone's invited kind of party

2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:52.480
 right now

2:01:53.200 --> 2:01:54.640
 that the major issue

2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:55.760
 in the field of neuroscience

2:01:55.760 --> 2:01:56.240
 at least

2:01:56.240 --> 2:01:57.040
 through my view

2:01:57.040 --> 2:01:59.040
 is that there's no conceptual leadership

2:01:59.040 --> 2:01:59.680
 no one is saying

2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:00.560
 we need to work on

2:02:00.560 --> 2:02:01.600
 and solve this problem

2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:02.640
 or that problem

2:02:02.640 --> 2:02:04.960
 it's very fragmented right now

2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:06.480
 now the good news is

2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:07.680
 people are communicating

2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:08.240
 so

2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:09.200
 computer scientists

2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:10.240
 and people who work on AI

2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:10.880
 machine vision

2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:12.000
 are talking to biologists

2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:12.880
 and vice versa

2:02:13.520 --> 2:02:13.920
 but

2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:15.520
 it's very dispersed

2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:17.280
 is there a lot of different data sets

2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:17.840
 like it will

2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:18.720
 in your work

2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:20.000
 that you've just come across

2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:21.840
 is there a huge number of

2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:23.040
 disparate data sets

2:02:23.040 --> 2:02:24.720
 around neuroscience and so on

2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:25.040
 or

2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:27.280
 well there's a lot of cell sequencing stuff

2:02:27.280 --> 2:02:28.160
 so the brode

2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:28.720
 over at

2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:29.280
 you know

2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:30.320
 in Boston

2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:30.880
 and then

2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:31.680
 on this coast

2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:33.280
 the Chen Zuckerberg initiative

2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:35.040
 what you know

2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:36.880
 they did

2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:38.240
 three billion dollars to

2:02:38.240 --> 2:02:40.000
 sequence every cell type

2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:41.520
 in humans and in animals

2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:42.160
 and trying

2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:43.600
 I think their goal is to

2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:44.880
 cure every disease

2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:46.320
 by some date

2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:47.040
 I don't know in the

2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:47.920
 in the future

2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:52.000
 huge data sets

2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:52.880
 of gene expression

2:02:52.880 --> 2:02:53.920
 and protein expression

2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:55.680
 that's valuable

2:02:55.680 --> 2:02:56.080
 I think

2:02:57.040 --> 2:02:57.760
 no one really knows

2:02:57.760 --> 2:02:59.840
 how to think about neural circuits

2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:00.560
 and what

2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:01.840
 what is a neural circuit

2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:03.840
 is it one structure

2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:05.440
 is it two structures

2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:06.480
 communicating

2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:06.880
 I think

2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:08.720
 this is where I actually think

2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:10.080
 that the robotics

2:03:10.080 --> 2:03:10.800
 is going to

2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:11.760
 tell us

2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:13.520
 how the brain works

2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:15.280
 because it's tempting to think

2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:16.160
 that the brain

2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:18.000
 has all these cell types

2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:19.520
 and circuits in order to solve

2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:20.720
 specific problems

2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:21.760
 but it might be that

2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:23.120
 the fundamental algorithm

2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:24.880
 is to create cells and circuits

2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:25.680
 that can solve

2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:26.960
 variable problems

2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:28.240
 when we know in the retina

2:03:28.240 --> 2:03:29.600
 just a very simple example

2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:30.160
 is that

2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:31.120
 we've always heard about like

2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:32.400
 cones are for color vision

2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:33.280
 and high acuity

2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:34.560
 and rods are for night vision

2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:35.040
 and

2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:36.000
 and

2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:37.440
 non color vision

2:03:37.440 --> 2:03:38.080
 but

2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:39.680
 at the dusk dawn

2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:40.720
 transition

2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:41.920
 certain cell types switch

2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:43.040
 to do completely different

2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:44.320
 have a complete different function

2:03:44.320 --> 2:03:45.440
 for viewing starry night

2:03:45.440 --> 2:03:46.320
 versus

2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:47.920
 what they do during the daytime

2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:48.560
 so

2:03:48.560 --> 2:03:50.000
 neurons multiplex

2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:51.120
 and I think building

2:03:51.680 --> 2:03:53.760
 machines that can multiplex

2:03:53.760 --> 2:03:55.440
 and can evolve themselves

2:03:55.440 --> 2:03:56.560
 is going to

2:03:56.560 --> 2:03:57.680
 help us really understand

2:03:57.680 --> 2:03:58.560
 what the brain is doing

2:03:58.560 --> 2:03:59.120
 we

2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:00.480
 need to tease out the fundamental

2:04:00.480 --> 2:04:01.360
 algorithms

2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:02.160
 we know they're like

2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:03.200
 motion detection

2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:04.560
 and spatial vision

2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:05.040
 and things like that

2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:06.080
 I think machines are going to

2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:07.520
 be much faster at that than

2:04:08.160 --> 2:04:09.280
 our understanding of

2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:10.960
 biology

2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:12.160
 and how the brain does that

2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:14.960
 basically I'll be out of a job

2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:16.320
 and people like you will have a job

2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:16.960
 well no

2:04:16.960 --> 2:04:18.560
 I think the main idea is that

2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:20.960
 there won't be a job

2:04:20.960 --> 2:04:22.000
 that's machine learning

2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:22.160
 or

2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:23.840
 computer vision

2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:24.640
 it's just

2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:25.520
 it's a tool that

2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:27.600
 neuroscientists will

2:04:27.600 --> 2:04:28.720
 use more and more and more

2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:29.520
 and

2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:31.760
 biologists would use

2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:32.880
 I mean this whole idea that

2:04:32.880 --> 2:04:34.320
 it will just be a

2:04:34.320 --> 2:04:35.200
 tool

2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:36.400
 that allows you to start

2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:40.000
 expanding the kind of things

2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:40.880
 you can study

2:04:41.600 --> 2:04:42.800
 well the next generation

2:04:42.800 --> 2:04:43.360
 coming up

2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:44.160
 I can say this because

2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:45.440
 I now am blessed to have a

2:04:45.440 --> 2:04:46.720
 bioengineering student

2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:47.920
 they think about problems so

2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:48.800
 differently

2:04:48.800 --> 2:04:49.840
 than biologists do

2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:51.600
 we realize the other day

2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:52.880
 we both came up with a set of

2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:54.240
 ideas around a certain project

2:04:54.240 --> 2:04:54.880
 and we realized that

2:04:55.440 --> 2:04:56.480
 her version of it was the

2:04:56.480 --> 2:04:57.920
 exact opposite of mine

2:04:57.920 --> 2:04:58.240
 you know

2:04:58.240 --> 2:04:59.360
 and hers was far

2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:00.160
 far more rational

2:05:00.160 --> 2:05:00.960
 it's just an engineering

2:05:00.960 --> 2:05:01.440
 perspective

2:05:01.440 --> 2:05:02.640
 it's like why would we

2:05:02.640 --> 2:05:03.440
 do that last

2:05:03.440 --> 2:05:04.800
 we should do that first

2:05:04.800 --> 2:05:05.680
 I think that the

2:05:05.680 --> 2:05:06.880
 the next generation is

2:05:06.880 --> 2:05:08.080
 really interested in

2:05:08.080 --> 2:05:09.680
 solving practical problems

2:05:09.680 --> 2:05:10.640
 it's a lot like computer

2:05:10.640 --> 2:05:12.000
 science and engineering was

2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:12.880
 in the late 90s

2:05:12.880 --> 2:05:13.680
 it was like

2:05:13.680 --> 2:05:14.800
 you can go do a PhD

2:05:14.800 --> 2:05:16.320
 in computer science and engineering

2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:16.960
 maybe

2:05:16.960 --> 2:05:18.160
 or you go work for a company

2:05:18.160 --> 2:05:19.040
 and actually build stuff

2:05:19.040 --> 2:05:20.080
 that's useful

2:05:20.080 --> 2:05:21.120
 I think neuroscientists

2:05:21.120 --> 2:05:21.840
 and people interested in

2:05:21.840 --> 2:05:22.480
 neuroscience

2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:23.680
 are starting to think

2:05:23.680 --> 2:05:24.560
 how can I build stuff

2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:25.440
 that's useful

2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:26.480
 and this is

2:05:26.480 --> 2:05:27.280
 statement is supported

2:05:27.280 --> 2:05:28.240
 by the fact that many

2:05:28.800 --> 2:05:29.760
 people in my business

2:05:30.480 --> 2:05:32.000
 leave their academic labs

2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:33.200
 fortunately not all of them

2:05:33.200 --> 2:05:34.400
 but they leave their academic labs

2:05:34.400 --> 2:05:35.440
 and they go work for companies

2:05:36.320 --> 2:05:37.440
 like Neuralink

2:05:37.440 --> 2:05:38.720
 like Neuralink

2:05:38.720 --> 2:05:39.760
 this is something I think

2:05:39.760 --> 2:05:41.360
 with they've spoken a few times

2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:41.840
 offline

2:05:41.840 --> 2:05:43.200
 about

2:05:44.800 --> 2:05:45.200
 as

2:05:45.200 --> 2:05:46.640
 let me speak of computer vision

2:05:47.200 --> 2:05:48.640
 I'm fascinated by the eye

2:05:48.640 --> 2:05:50.640
 I did a bunch of work on the eye

2:05:50.640 --> 2:05:51.360
 so from

2:05:51.360 --> 2:05:52.720
 there's the neuroscientists

2:05:52.720 --> 2:05:53.840
 there's a neurobiology way

2:05:53.840 --> 2:05:55.040
 of studying the eye

2:05:55.040 --> 2:05:56.240
 and there's the computer vision

2:05:56.240 --> 2:05:57.280
 way of studying the eye

2:05:57.840 --> 2:05:58.960
 and the computer vision way

2:05:58.960 --> 2:05:59.760
 of studying the eye

2:05:59.760 --> 2:06:00.960
 of just like observing

2:06:00.960 --> 2:06:02.960
 noncontact sensing of humans

2:06:02.960 --> 2:06:04.240
 is really fascinating to me

2:06:04.240 --> 2:06:05.680
 in studying human behavior

2:06:05.680 --> 2:06:06.640
 in different contexts

2:06:06.640 --> 2:06:08.800
 like in semi autonomous vehicles

2:06:09.520 --> 2:06:10.320
 it seemed like

2:06:10.320 --> 2:06:11.600
 there's a lot of signal

2:06:11.600 --> 2:06:12.640
 that comes from the eye

2:06:12.640 --> 2:06:13.760
 that comes from blinking

2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:16.880
 that's not fully understood yet

2:06:16.880 --> 2:06:18.160
 it's been in the lab

2:06:18.160 --> 2:06:19.440
 it's been used quite a bit

2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:21.600
 to study like the dilation

2:06:21.600 --> 2:06:22.480
 of the pupil

2:06:22.480 --> 2:06:23.440
 all those kinds of things

2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:24.480
 are used to

2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:27.280
 to infer workload

2:06:27.280 --> 2:06:28.080
 cognitive load

2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:29.040
 all those kinds of things

2:06:29.680 --> 2:06:31.680
 but the pictures is murky

2:06:32.480 --> 2:06:34.240
 it's not completely well understood

2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:35.440
 especially in the wild

2:06:35.440 --> 2:06:36.720
 how much signal you can get

2:06:36.720 --> 2:06:37.280
 from the eye

2:06:37.280 --> 2:06:38.240
 from the human face

2:06:38.240 --> 2:06:42.000
 I've downloaded Joe Rogan's

2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.080
 all of the podcasts he's ever done

2:06:44.080 --> 2:06:44.480
 video

2:06:45.520 --> 2:06:47.520
 you have the youtube bank

2:06:47.520 --> 2:06:48.640
 I have the youtube bank

2:06:48.640 --> 2:06:50.720
 for a reason that

2:06:51.360 --> 2:06:53.680
 this was before he went

2:06:53.680 --> 2:06:54.480
 with Spotify

2:06:55.680 --> 2:06:56.800
 you own the archive

2:06:56.800 --> 2:06:57.600
 there's PubMed

2:06:57.600 --> 2:06:59.680
 and then there's the Joe Rogan experience

2:06:59.680 --> 2:07:00.400
 owned by

2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:01.920
 or maintained by Lex

2:07:01.920 --> 2:07:05.120
 for my private collection

2:07:05.120 --> 2:07:06.720
 no the reason I did it

2:07:06.720 --> 2:07:11.200
 and I did the rigorous processing of it

2:07:11.200 --> 2:07:11.840
 which is like

2:07:13.920 --> 2:07:15.680
 I extracted all of the faces

2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:16.880
 I did the really good

2:07:16.880 --> 2:07:17.680
 blink track

2:07:17.680 --> 2:07:18.960
 of the pupil tracking

2:07:18.960 --> 2:07:21.040
 and the blink detection

2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:22.080
 for the entirety

2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:24.400
 I should say it's from episode

2:07:24.400 --> 2:07:24.640
 like

2:07:25.840 --> 2:07:26.720
 I forget what it is

2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:28.160
 but it's like episode 900

2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:30.560
 when they switched to 1080p video

2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:33.040
 it was like much crappier video

2:07:33.040 --> 2:07:34.240
 it's still kind of

2:07:34.240 --> 2:07:36.480
 you log when there was marijuana consumption

2:07:36.480 --> 2:07:37.840
 or when there was drinking

2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:38.640
 when there's smoke

2:07:38.640 --> 2:07:39.520
 I mean there's so many

2:07:39.520 --> 2:07:41.120
 because that's gonna like

2:07:41.120 --> 2:07:42.880
 just it won't throw off the data

2:07:42.880 --> 2:07:45.760
 but it's relevant to the pupil data

2:07:47.440 --> 2:07:50.080
 so let's just put it this way

2:07:50.080 --> 2:07:51.360
 there's a lot of fascinating

2:07:51.360 --> 2:07:53.040
 computer vision problems involved

2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:57.040
 but I only kept long sequences of data

2:07:57.040 --> 2:07:59.440
 where the eyes detect exceptionally well

2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:02.640
 and I also removed people

2:08:02.640 --> 2:08:04.080
 that were wearing glasses

2:08:04.080 --> 2:08:05.120
 I removed

2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:06.320
 there's certain people

2:08:06.320 --> 2:08:11.840
 that have a way of moving their eyes

2:08:12.800 --> 2:08:14.000
 and squinting

2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.400
 where it's harder to infer

2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:19.600
 like concrete blinks

2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:20.880
 you know

2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:23.280
 they'll kind of have a squint

2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:24.160
 the whole time

2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:27.440
 and their blink is very light

2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:29.120
 it's very tough to know

2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:32.320
 what's an actual blink

2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:32.720
 so I wanted to

2:08:32.720 --> 2:08:33.920
 then you got those baseball cap

2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:34.400
 wearing guys

2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:34.880
 baseball cap

2:08:34.880 --> 2:08:36.880
 there are certain people that go on podcasts

2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:38.080
 and wear baseball caps

2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:39.680
 and don't reveal their

2:08:39.680 --> 2:08:41.120
 I don't know if they realize it or not

2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:42.240
 until it comes out

2:08:42.240 --> 2:08:44.400
 but their face is completely obscured

2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:45.520
 from vision

2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:47.680
 and from a computer vision perspective

2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:49.040
 people that wear makeup

2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:51.200
 and usually women on their eyes

2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:52.560
 it complicates things

2:08:52.560 --> 2:08:54.720
 like eyelashes all complicate things

2:08:54.720 --> 2:08:57.040
 so you can clean stuff up

2:08:57.040 --> 2:08:59.200
 just so you have really crisp signal

2:08:59.200 --> 2:09:00.160
 you don't have to

2:09:00.160 --> 2:09:02.080
 you can deal with issues

2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:03.680
 but there's so many hours

2:09:03.680 --> 2:09:04.880
 of Joe Rogan video

2:09:04.880 --> 2:09:06.480
 anyway I say all that

2:09:06.480 --> 2:09:09.200
 because I was searching for

2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:11.120
 an interesting personal experiment

2:09:11.120 --> 2:09:11.680
 for me because

2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:14.320
 I saw in drivers

2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:15.760
 when I was looking at

2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:17.120
 eye movement in drivers

2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:18.160
 it seemed to indicate

2:09:19.120 --> 2:09:21.520
 there seemed to be quite a lot of signal there

2:09:21.520 --> 2:09:22.320
 that indicates

2:09:23.200 --> 2:09:24.640
 amount of cognitive load

2:09:25.360 --> 2:09:26.560
 but it's not clear

2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:28.000
 if there's something conclusive

2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:30.560
 but if there is some signal

2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:31.760
 that's a really powerful one

2:09:31.760 --> 2:09:32.800
 because eye movement

2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:35.120
 can be detected in the wild

2:09:35.120 --> 2:09:36.320
 like you and I sitting here

2:09:36.320 --> 2:09:38.320
 I can detect eye movement really well

2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:39.440
 pupil dilation

2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:41.280
 is a really crappy indicator

2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:42.560
 and it's luminance dependent

2:09:42.560 --> 2:09:43.920
 like if I turn toward a light

2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:45.200
 it's around

2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:45.840
 it

2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:47.200
 pupils change size

2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:48.560
 depending on level of alertness

2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:49.760
 arousal, autonomic arousal

2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:51.760
 but also overall levels of luminance

2:09:51.760 --> 2:09:52.800
 it's very very hard

2:09:53.360 --> 2:09:54.800
 but there are

2:09:54.800 --> 2:09:56.640
 I mean you're sitting on a gold mine

2:09:57.680 --> 2:10:00.880
 because there is a lot of interest right now

2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:02.880
 in measuring state

2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:04.240
 through noncontact sensing

2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:04.880
 yes

2:10:04.880 --> 2:10:05.680
 heart rate variability

2:10:05.680 --> 2:10:06.960
 through changes in skin tone

2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:08.400
 just off a camera

2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:09.040
 can you imagine that

2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:10.080
 at the point where

2:10:10.080 --> 2:10:11.040
 you just look at some video

2:10:11.040 --> 2:10:12.000
 and you're like oh they're

2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:12.960
 they're getting more stressed

2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:13.520
 or worked up

2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:14.080
 and they're not

2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:15.120
 based on a heat map

2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:16.560
 of some little patch on their face

2:10:16.560 --> 2:10:17.680
 because everyone's gonna

2:10:17.680 --> 2:10:18.480
 have this slight

2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:19.360
 you know sort of

2:10:19.360 --> 2:10:20.880
 compartmentalize it slightly differently

2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:22.320
 but you can learn it pretty quickly

2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:23.360
 we know this when someone's like

2:10:23.360 --> 2:10:23.920
 giving a talk

2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:24.560
 and we see them starting

2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:25.760
 blotching on their

2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:27.280
 neck you know

2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:28.000
 this is the like

2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:30.480
 the thesis defense response

2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:31.120
 right

2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:31.600
 we know it

2:10:31.600 --> 2:10:33.840
 and it's a stressful situation

2:10:33.840 --> 2:10:35.120
 because it's not passing

2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:36.640
 your thesis defense is rough

2:10:37.360 --> 2:10:38.640
 and we can see that

2:10:38.640 --> 2:10:39.840
 but cameras can pick that up

2:10:39.840 --> 2:10:40.720
 really easily

2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:42.080
 at much lower levels

2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:42.640
 than the

2:10:42.640 --> 2:10:43.760
 the blatant blotching

2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:44.720
 kind of effect

2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:45.680
 and eye movements

2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:49.040
 certainly are powerful indications

2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:51.360
 of the state of the autonomic system

2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:52.400
 so what do you

2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:53.520
 do you think there are things

2:10:54.560 --> 2:10:55.440
 from a high level

2:10:55.440 --> 2:10:56.160
 that you can pick up

2:10:56.160 --> 2:10:57.520
 from eye movement

2:10:57.520 --> 2:10:58.560
 and blinking

2:10:58.560 --> 2:10:59.680
 well blink frequency

2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:00.960
 is going to increase

2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:02.960
 as people get tired

2:11:03.520 --> 2:11:04.160
 right

2:11:04.160 --> 2:11:04.960
 I mean they've actually

2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:06.160
 been teased a lot online

2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:07.200
 because I don't blink much

2:11:07.200 --> 2:11:08.480
 when I'll do a post

2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:08.880
 and I

2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:10.000
 and so I did a whole post

2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:10.800
 about blinking

2:11:10.800 --> 2:11:11.760
 about the science of blinking

2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:12.800
 there's some data

2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:13.600
 very strong data

2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:14.720
 not from my lab

2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:15.760
 that show that

2:11:15.760 --> 2:11:16.560
 every time you blink

2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:18.160
 it resets your perception of time

2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:19.280
 they have people do these

2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:20.320
 kind of track a

2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:22.320
 kind of a Doppler like thing

2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:23.360
 and anyway

2:11:23.360 --> 2:11:25.040
 blinking resets your perception of time

2:11:25.040 --> 2:11:26.720
 that there's a dopaminergic mechanism

2:11:26.720 --> 2:11:27.360
 in a

2:11:27.360 --> 2:11:30.400
 in the blink related circuitry of the brain

2:11:30.400 --> 2:11:31.200
 when people are very alert

2:11:31.200 --> 2:11:32.320
 they tend to not blink very much

2:11:32.320 --> 2:11:32.880
 when we're sleepy

2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:33.760
 we tend to blink more

2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:35.120
 and our eyes tend to close

2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:36.800
 now some people are more hooded

2:11:36.800 --> 2:11:37.200
 in there

2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:38.320
 the way their eyes sit

2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:39.120
 some people

2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:40.400
 are like this all the time

2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:41.520
 there are some very famous people

2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:42.320
 I'm not going to name them

2:11:42.320 --> 2:11:42.960
 because I

2:11:42.960 --> 2:11:44.720
 might run into them at some point

2:11:44.720 --> 2:11:45.600
 who are like

2:11:45.600 --> 2:11:46.800
 accused of being sociopaths

2:11:46.800 --> 2:11:48.560
 because they don't blink very often

2:11:48.560 --> 2:11:49.360
 but they might just have

2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:50.880
 high levels of autonomic arousal

2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:52.160
 they just don't blink very much

2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:54.800
 also depends on how lubricated the eyes are

2:11:54.800 --> 2:11:56.720
 so I think within individual

2:11:56.720 --> 2:11:57.440
 yes

2:11:57.440 --> 2:11:59.040
 you can get a lot of information

2:11:59.040 --> 2:12:00.320
 I don't think we can say

2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:01.600
 this person's blinking a lot

2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:02.240
 they're lying

2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:03.600
 this person or they're tired

2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:05.040
 this person doesn't blink

2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:05.280
 they're

2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:06.480
 they're

2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:07.040
 stressed

2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:07.600
 I think

2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:07.840
 if you

2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:10.240
 understand that person's baseline

2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:10.960
 you can get it

2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:11.760
 and presumably

2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:14.160
 well having been on the Joe Rogan experience

2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:15.440
 I can say when you first sit down there

2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:16.960
 if you've never been in there before

2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:18.160
 you're on my day to say by the way

2:12:18.160 --> 2:12:19.440
 oh my

2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:20.720
 well I bet you I

2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:21.680
 I will admit to being

2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:22.320
 you know

2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:22.800
 first time

2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:23.840
 sitting down there

2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:24.640
 I mean Joe is

2:12:24.640 --> 2:12:25.600
 incredibly gracious

2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:27.040
 make me feel very comfortable there

2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:27.600
 but

2:12:27.600 --> 2:12:28.320
 yeah it's a

2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:30.000
 it's an intense experience

2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:31.200
 it's a small space too

2:12:31.200 --> 2:12:32.640
 anytime you enter a small space

2:12:32.640 --> 2:12:33.680
 from a big space

2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:34.560
 in this old studio

2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:36.400
 is it

2:12:36.400 --> 2:12:37.200
 you're familiar with

2:12:37.920 --> 2:12:39.040
 there's a breaking in period

2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:39.920
 where you're getting

2:12:39.920 --> 2:12:40.720
 to know somebody

2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:42.480
 and so I'm sure my levels of autonomic

2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:42.960
 arousal

2:12:43.520 --> 2:12:44.480
 front of the podcast

2:12:44.480 --> 2:12:45.840
 we're higher than later

2:12:45.840 --> 2:12:47.680
 so but once you have a baseline

2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:48.240
 established

2:12:48.240 --> 2:12:49.840
 you can get a lot of data

2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:50.800
 on somebody

2:12:50.800 --> 2:12:51.840
 simply from blinks

2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:54.640
 some people averting gaze too

2:12:54.640 --> 2:12:55.760
 if you have both people

2:12:55.760 --> 2:12:56.720
 that's really powerful

2:12:56.720 --> 2:12:58.000
 this is the holy grail

2:12:58.000 --> 2:12:59.360
 another holy grail of neuroscience

2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:01.520
 we've mainly looked at subjects

2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:02.320
 in isolation

2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:02.880
 isolation

2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:03.760
 there hasn't been

2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:05.440
 much brain imaging of two people

2:13:05.440 --> 2:13:06.560
 in interacting

2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:07.360
 or even

2:13:07.360 --> 2:13:08.960
 in animal models of two mice

2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:10.240
 or two monkeys interacting

2:13:10.240 --> 2:13:12.640
 it's all like person scanner

2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:13.360
 bite bar

2:13:13.360 --> 2:13:14.160
 I mean if you've ever been in one

2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:14.640
 of these scanner

2:13:14.640 --> 2:13:16.080
 you're like in a bite bar

2:13:16.080 --> 2:13:16.960
 it's very medieval

2:13:17.520 --> 2:13:18.400
 and so you think

2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:19.440
 in the interaction

2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:20.160
 there's actually

2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:22.000
 you can almost study them

2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:23.040
 as a single brain

2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:24.240
 or as a single system

2:13:24.240 --> 2:13:26.160
 the two brains are a single system

2:13:26.160 --> 2:13:26.960
 I think with AI

2:13:26.960 --> 2:13:27.920
 it's highly correlated

2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:28.400
 yeah maybe

2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:29.920
 are your blinks triggering my blinks

2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:30.560
 like you know

2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:32.240
 are your non blink epochs

2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:35.120
 extending my non blink epochs

2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:36.720
 there's a fascinating space

2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:37.920
 to explore there

2:13:37.920 --> 2:13:38.960
 and no one's done it

2:13:39.920 --> 2:13:41.200
 and because everyone

2:13:41.200 --> 2:13:42.080
 let the

2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:43.600
 Joe Rogan Experience archive

2:13:43.600 --> 2:13:44.320
 disappear

2:13:44.320 --> 2:13:45.120
 except for you

2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:45.680
 you grab

2:13:45.680 --> 2:13:46.080
 well actually

2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:47.040
 did you get the comments too

2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:48.560
 because I think the comments were

2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:49.520
 almost as entertaining

2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:50.720
 as the conversation

2:13:50.720 --> 2:13:51.840
 you know what you just made me

2:13:51.840 --> 2:13:52.960
 realize with the couplings

2:13:52.960 --> 2:13:53.920
 I have a better data

2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:55.360
 than the Joe Rogan podcast

2:13:55.360 --> 2:13:56.800
 with high resolution video

2:13:56.800 --> 2:13:58.080
 which is the raw video

2:13:58.080 --> 2:13:59.440
 for this podcast

2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:00.240
 so for example

2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:01.920
 both cameras right now

2:14:01.920 --> 2:14:03.360
 are recording you and I

2:14:03.360 --> 2:14:04.560
 full full feed

2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:06.080
 the final result

2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:07.520
 will switch cameras back and forth

2:14:07.520 --> 2:14:08.880
 but I have the full feed

2:14:08.880 --> 2:14:09.520
 right

2:14:09.520 --> 2:14:10.960
 so I can have the blinking

2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:12.560
 for both you and I the whole time

2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:13.840
 I bet you people trigger

2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:14.640
 blinks

2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:15.680
 and in one another

2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:16.640
 you know

2:14:16.640 --> 2:14:18.000
 and there's also like the

2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:19.600
 the simplest way to think about

2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:20.240
 the blinks

2:14:20.240 --> 2:14:21.440
 and the attentional thing

2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:22.800
 and the alertness is

2:14:22.800 --> 2:14:24.080
 two fighters in the

2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:25.360
 in the standoff

2:14:25.360 --> 2:14:26.720
 there's this whole lore around

2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:27.760
 who blinks first

2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:28.000
 yeah

2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:28.960
 it's like they blink first

2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:29.440
 well

2:14:29.440 --> 2:14:30.640
 what are what are we really asking

2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:31.920
 they're asking whether or not

2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:33.920
 one person can maintain focus

2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:36.640
 longer than the other person

2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:36.880
 which

2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:39.280
 is an important parameter

2:14:39.280 --> 2:14:40.480
 it's not the only parameter

2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:42.560
 but it's an important parameter

2:14:42.560 --> 2:14:43.920
 and so that blinking contest

2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:45.120
 even though they don't square off

2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:46.560
 as a blinking contest

2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:48.160
 it's well known that the first to

2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:48.800
 blink

2:14:48.800 --> 2:14:50.480
 is revealing something about their

2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:53.440
 capacity to hold attention

2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:55.920
 you've started an amazing podcast

2:14:55.920 --> 2:14:57.840
 that we mentioned a few times

2:14:57.840 --> 2:14:59.680
 people should definitely check it out

2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:02.480
 it's called the Huberman Lab Podcast

2:15:02.480 --> 2:15:02.640
 it

2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:05.200
 it does your

2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:05.840
 it's basically

2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:08.240
 it embodies

2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:10.880
 the personality of Andrew Huberman

2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:11.600
 which is like

2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:13.840
 makes science accessible

2:15:15.840 --> 2:15:16.560
 but also

2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:19.760
 fascinating

2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:22.320
 and giving it like

2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:23.440
 what do you call it

2:15:23.440 --> 2:15:25.360
 you give tools for everyday life

2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:26.400
 meaning

2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:29.200
 it kind of grounds it like

2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:31.200
 what the hell does this mean for my life

2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.560
 but then also does the beauty of science

2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:35.280
 at the same time

2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:36.240
 so I love

2:15:36.800 --> 2:15:37.600
 I love both the

2:15:38.400 --> 2:15:40.240
 the rigor and the openness of the whole

2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:40.480
 thing

2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:41.680
 plus the whole corrections thing

2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:42.160
 as I mentioned

2:15:42.720 --> 2:15:43.200
 anyway

2:15:43.840 --> 2:15:46.080
 what's been the hardest part

2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:47.440
 of this whole process

2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:48.080
 you're one of

2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:48.880
 already

2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:49.200
 one of

2:15:51.200 --> 2:15:51.840
 the only

2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:53.600
 and one of the best

2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:54.720
 science

2:15:54.720 --> 2:15:56.480
 podcasters out there

2:15:56.480 --> 2:15:58.000
 so in that process

2:15:58.560 --> 2:15:59.680
 what's been the hardest

2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:01.040
 what's been the most exciting part

2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:02.160
 wow

2:16:02.160 --> 2:16:02.880
 well first of all

2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:03.520
 thanks for the

2:16:04.160 --> 2:16:05.440
 kind words about the podcast

2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:06.960
 it was inspired by you

2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:07.920
 I

2:16:07.920 --> 2:16:08.640
 absolutely

2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:08.880
 it's

2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:10.960
 that's no BS

2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:11.440
 I

2:16:11.440 --> 2:16:12.000
 the last time

2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:14.640
 we met to do an interview for your podcast

2:16:14.640 --> 2:16:16.080
 we talked a little bit about it and

2:16:16.080 --> 2:16:18.080
 you gave me the

2:16:18.240 --> 2:16:18.880
 subtle

2:16:18.880 --> 2:16:20.480
 nudge that maybe there was a

2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:21.600
 there was a podcast there

2:16:21.600 --> 2:16:22.880
 and I thought about it and I left

2:16:22.880 --> 2:16:23.600
 and I was just like

2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:24.640
 I gotta do this thing

2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:25.040
 and

2:16:25.040 --> 2:16:26.720
 and you really gave me the encouragement to do it

2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:28.000
 and your podcast

2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:30.160
 this podcast has really forged the way

2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:30.480
 you've been

2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:32.400
 tip of the spear on

2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:33.440
 serious

2:16:34.160 --> 2:16:34.800
 scientific

2:16:34.800 --> 2:16:35.600
 intellectual

2:16:35.600 --> 2:16:36.240
 yet fun

2:16:36.240 --> 2:16:37.520
 accessible conversation

2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:37.920
 and so

2:16:38.480 --> 2:16:39.200
 I

2:16:39.200 --> 2:16:39.440
 as

2:16:40.240 --> 2:16:41.120
 your colleague

2:16:41.120 --> 2:16:42.160
 and friend

2:16:42.160 --> 2:16:42.800
 and but

2:16:43.520 --> 2:16:44.480
 just even if

2:16:44.480 --> 2:16:45.360
 those things weren't true

2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:47.200
 like this this podcast was

2:16:47.200 --> 2:16:48.400
 and is the inspiration

2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:49.040
 there's no question

2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:49.600
 so much

2:16:49.600 --> 2:16:49.920
 yeah

2:16:49.920 --> 2:16:51.440
 I really like 100%

2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:52.240
 and

2:16:52.960 --> 2:16:54.880
 when I decided to do the podcast

2:16:54.880 --> 2:16:55.120
 the

2:16:55.120 --> 2:16:56.320
 Hebrew Lab podcast

2:16:56.320 --> 2:16:58.080
 I thought really long and hard about what

2:16:58.080 --> 2:16:58.800
 would work best

2:16:58.800 --> 2:17:00.160
 and would be most beneficial

2:17:00.160 --> 2:17:01.520
 turned out to be the hardest thing

2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:04.400
 which is to stay on a single topic

2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:06.480
 for three or four or more episodes

2:17:06.480 --> 2:17:07.920
 before switching to a new topic

2:17:08.560 --> 2:17:09.040
 because

2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:12.160
 I know from the experience of

2:17:12.160 --> 2:17:14.080
 university and teaching in university

2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:15.680
 as you know

2:17:15.680 --> 2:17:16.560
 as well that

2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:20.640
 there's always the temptation to pivot to something else

2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:20.960
 but the

2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:23.440
 drilling into something really deeply

2:17:23.440 --> 2:17:24.080
 is where the

2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:25.760
 where the gems reside

2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:26.480
 and

2:17:26.480 --> 2:17:26.800
 the

2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:27.760
 the challenge has been

2:17:28.320 --> 2:17:29.440
 how to make it interesting

2:17:29.440 --> 2:17:31.200
 how to keep people on board

2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:33.120
 how to give people tools along the way

2:17:34.320 --> 2:17:36.560
 but also stay close to the scientific data

2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:39.600
 I like to think that we're headed in the right direction

2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:41.040
 it still needs to evolve

2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:41.280
 but

2:17:41.280 --> 2:17:43.280
 that's been a challenge

2:17:44.160 --> 2:17:44.560
 I think

2:17:45.920 --> 2:17:48.800
 I also am challenged by the fact that there's a tremendous

2:17:48.800 --> 2:17:50.720
 range of backgrounds of listeners

2:17:50.720 --> 2:17:52.640
 so some people have asked for

2:17:52.640 --> 2:17:53.440
 more names

2:17:53.440 --> 2:17:55.600
 like more bits and parts of the nervous system

2:17:55.600 --> 2:17:57.440
 and cellular molecular mechanisms

2:17:57.440 --> 2:17:58.480
 and all that kind of thing

2:17:58.480 --> 2:17:59.360
 and other people said

2:17:59.360 --> 2:18:00.800
 I don't understand any of that stuff

2:18:00.800 --> 2:18:02.640
 but I think I'm keeping up and so

2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:05.200
 unlike a university course where there are prerequisites

2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:06.560
 and everyone's coming to the table

2:18:06.560 --> 2:18:08.240
 with more or less the same knowledge

2:18:08.240 --> 2:18:10.480
 I have a very limited sense of what the audience

2:18:10.480 --> 2:18:11.760
 knows and doesn't know

2:18:11.760 --> 2:18:13.440
 so that's why I incorporated the feature

2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:15.120
 of the comment section on YouTube

2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:17.200
 being a source of feedback

2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:19.520
 and I do a

2:18:19.520 --> 2:18:21.840
 kind of an office hours like episode

2:18:21.840 --> 2:18:23.040
 every third or fourth episode

2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:24.800
 where I address common questions

2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:27.360
 and I think that the podcast space

2:18:27.360 --> 2:18:27.920
 in my mind

2:18:28.960 --> 2:18:30.560
 at least for the sort of podcast I'm doing

2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:34.400
 needed a venue for the listeners

2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:34.720
 to be a

2:18:35.440 --> 2:18:37.120
 more integral part of the experience

2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:39.440
 as opposed to just commenting on what they liked

2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:41.760
 or didn't like. So while I like to hear what people

2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:42.480
 liked and didn't like

2:18:42.480 --> 2:18:44.080
 I also really like to hear about

2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:45.200
 hey tell me more about

2:18:45.840 --> 2:18:46.720
 temperature minimums

2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:48.000
 and how they can be used to phase shifts

2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:49.600
 circadian rhythms or whatever it is

2:18:50.160 --> 2:18:51.760
 and I realized that I'm probably losing

2:18:51.760 --> 2:18:52.800
 some people along the way

2:18:52.800 --> 2:18:53.520
 but hopefully

2:18:54.160 --> 2:18:55.200
 at the end of each month

2:18:56.080 --> 2:18:58.880
 and because of the way that the episodes are archived

2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:00.560
 people will come away feeling

2:19:00.560 --> 2:19:01.760
 as if they've learned a ton

2:19:01.760 --> 2:19:03.600
 and they have tools that they can implement

2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:04.800
 and perhaps most importantly

2:19:04.800 --> 2:19:07.520
 that they're starting to think scientifically

2:19:07.520 --> 2:19:09.840
 about the tons of other stuff that's out there.

2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:12.080
 So that's been the challenge

2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:14.400
 and it's still really early days

2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:16.640
 but and of course

2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:18.080
 there's also an intentional challenge

2:19:18.080 --> 2:19:19.360
 I realize that people are busy

2:19:19.360 --> 2:19:20.800
 not everyone has two hours

2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:22.080
 to listen to a podcast

2:19:22.080 --> 2:19:23.440
 about jet lag and shift work

2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:26.160
 and raising kids and sleep

2:19:26.160 --> 2:19:27.040
 and that kind of thing

2:19:27.040 --> 2:19:27.760
 I'm not raising kids

2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:28.640
 but I did a whole thing

2:19:28.640 --> 2:19:29.920
 about babies and sleep with

2:19:30.800 --> 2:19:32.320
 and how parents can manage their sleep

2:19:32.320 --> 2:19:33.280
 when kids aren't sleeping.

2:19:33.840 --> 2:19:34.480
 So it's been

2:19:34.480 --> 2:19:37.600
 I'm hacking through the jungle

2:19:37.600 --> 2:19:39.040
 of all this stuff

2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:40.480
 but and I'll come right back to

2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:42.560
 my inspiration

2:19:42.560 --> 2:19:47.280
 and my north star on this

2:19:47.280 --> 2:19:50.160
 is getting to a point where

2:19:50.880 --> 2:19:53.440
 the audience that listens to this

2:19:53.440 --> 2:19:54.640
 feels the same way that I do

2:19:54.640 --> 2:19:56.320
 when I listen to your podcast.

2:19:56.320 --> 2:19:57.040
 Thank you so much.

2:19:57.040 --> 2:19:58.800
 Like when I turn into your podcast

2:19:58.800 --> 2:20:00.000
 I'm going to embarrass you a little bit more

2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:01.440
 by complimenting you a little bit more

2:20:01.440 --> 2:20:05.520
 but not out of a sadistic thing

2:20:05.520 --> 2:20:06.560
 but just because

2:20:06.560 --> 2:20:08.080
 when I tune into your podcast

2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:09.120
 or Joe's podcast

2:20:09.680 --> 2:20:11.040
 I have the same sensation

2:20:11.040 --> 2:20:11.920
 that other people have

2:20:11.920 --> 2:20:13.120
 like I feel like

2:20:13.760 --> 2:20:15.360
 I'm home of sorts

2:20:15.360 --> 2:20:17.280
 I'm like I'm familiar with the space

2:20:17.280 --> 2:20:18.880
 and I'd like people to feel comfortable

2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:20.640
 in the space that is the

2:20:20.640 --> 2:20:21.520
 Huber and Lab podcast

2:20:21.520 --> 2:20:22.480
 whatever that ends up being.

2:20:23.280 --> 2:20:25.760
 Yeah that's the magic of podcasting

2:20:25.760 --> 2:20:26.640
 it's like I feel like

2:20:26.640 --> 2:20:28.000
 I'm part of your life now

2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:29.440
 in a way that as a fan

2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:31.520
 that I wouldn't be otherwise

2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:33.680
 and you know like

2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:35.440
 I never was able to have that

2:20:35.440 --> 2:20:37.040
 with Carl Sagan for example

2:20:38.720 --> 2:20:40.720
 and that's a whole another level

2:20:40.720 --> 2:20:42.880
 of connection with a human being

2:20:42.880 --> 2:20:44.160
 that gets you excited

2:20:44.160 --> 2:20:46.160
 and then I share your excitement

2:20:46.160 --> 2:20:49.840
 about different topics in neuroscience

2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:54.640
 or just biology in general

2:20:54.640 --> 2:20:56.240
 and then I don't have to actually

2:20:56.240 --> 2:20:57.680
 understand everything you're saying

2:20:57.680 --> 2:21:00.800
 to to really enjoy it

2:21:00.800 --> 2:21:03.120
 so that's the magical podcasting

2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:04.640
 is like you can go through

2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:05.600
 like 10 minutes of

2:21:05.600 --> 2:21:06.560
 understanding what the hell

2:21:06.560 --> 2:21:07.440
 a person is saying

2:21:08.240 --> 2:21:11.440
 and then you enjoy the excitement

2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:12.880
 and then you reconnect to a thing

2:21:12.880 --> 2:21:14.000
 that you do understand

2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:15.280
 what they're saying

2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:16.640
 and you know that's

2:21:18.080 --> 2:21:19.840
 that personal coupled

2:21:19.840 --> 2:21:21.280
 with the scientific rigor

2:21:21.840 --> 2:21:22.480
 is magic

2:21:22.480 --> 2:21:23.360
 and finding the right

2:21:23.920 --> 2:21:24.800
 it's exploration

2:21:24.800 --> 2:21:26.240
 like Joe found something

2:21:26.240 --> 2:21:27.600
 that works for comedians

2:21:27.600 --> 2:21:28.240
 which is like

2:21:29.200 --> 2:21:30.800
 you know having a good laugh

2:21:30.800 --> 2:21:32.160
 but also every once in a while

2:21:32.720 --> 2:21:33.920
 talking seriously

2:21:33.920 --> 2:21:35.120
 about difficult topics

2:21:36.400 --> 2:21:37.680
 the scientific space

2:21:38.480 --> 2:21:39.280
 it was unclear

2:21:40.160 --> 2:21:41.600
 you haven't had guests on

2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:42.400
 not yet

2:21:42.400 --> 2:21:43.120
 but uh

2:21:43.120 --> 2:21:44.320
 maybe you'll come on as a

2:21:44.320 --> 2:21:44.960
 that's wrong

2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:45.840
 I was gonna invite

2:21:45.840 --> 2:21:48.080
 I was gonna try to force myself in there

2:21:48.080 --> 2:21:48.640
 I am

2:21:48.640 --> 2:21:50.080
 I'm officially inviting you now

2:21:50.080 --> 2:21:50.960
 will you come on the podcast?

2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:51.840
 I would love to

2:21:51.840 --> 2:21:52.400
 I would love to

2:21:52.400 --> 2:21:53.120
 fantastic

2:21:53.120 --> 2:21:54.640
 but it was it was hard

2:21:54.640 --> 2:21:57.120
 it's still a little bit difficult

2:21:57.120 --> 2:21:58.320
 to tell people

2:21:59.600 --> 2:22:00.880
 that no you don't get it

2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:02.720
 we're not gonna talk for 10 minutes

2:22:03.760 --> 2:22:05.280
 we're gonna talk for

2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:06.400
 three or four hours

2:22:07.200 --> 2:22:08.880
 it's a different for scientists

2:22:08.880 --> 2:22:09.760
 for like

2:22:09.760 --> 2:22:10.560
 they're like what

2:22:10.560 --> 2:22:12.160
 I don't what are we gonna talk about?

2:22:12.160 --> 2:22:14.160
 they think it's like the NPR interview

2:22:14.160 --> 2:22:14.880
 yes

2:22:14.880 --> 2:22:16.960
 and they don't realize

2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:17.600
 first of all

2:22:18.320 --> 2:22:19.520
 I think at his best

2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:21.760
 if you're like at the level of Joe Rogan

2:22:21.760 --> 2:22:22.960
 who I think is an excellent

2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:24.960
 conversationalist

2:22:25.600 --> 2:22:27.360
 it you just lose track of time

2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:28.960
 it can be three four or five hours

2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:30.240
 and you lose track of time

2:22:30.240 --> 2:22:31.760
 I'm still not there

2:22:31.760 --> 2:22:32.720
 I find that

2:22:32.720 --> 2:22:34.000
 it's still painful

2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:34.960
 like the conversation

2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:36.800
 is still challenging sometimes

2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:37.680
 you don't lose

2:22:37.680 --> 2:22:39.200
 quite as much of track of time

2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:40.640
 it's still an intellectual effort

2:22:40.640 --> 2:22:42.240
 and I think it might always be

2:22:42.240 --> 2:22:43.280
 as it would be with you

2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:44.480
 because you're talking about

2:22:44.480 --> 2:22:45.680
 difficult topics

2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:47.200
 maybe that require more brain

2:22:47.200 --> 2:22:48.160
 you're not

2:22:48.160 --> 2:22:49.600
 just shooting the shit

2:22:49.600 --> 2:22:51.040
 with like a Brian Red Band

2:22:51.040 --> 2:22:52.240
 or somebody like comedians

2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:53.360
 are just joking

2:22:53.360 --> 2:22:54.000
 well it's like

2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:54.960
 remember those shows

2:22:56.160 --> 2:22:56.560
 like where

2:22:57.360 --> 2:22:59.120
 those shows where someone would come out

2:22:59.120 --> 2:23:00.160
 and like spin plates

2:23:00.160 --> 2:23:01.360
 and they're running back and forth

2:23:01.360 --> 2:23:02.320
 and so

2:23:02.320 --> 2:23:04.640
 really good scientific discussion

2:23:04.640 --> 2:23:05.520
 is like that

2:23:05.520 --> 2:23:07.280
 you have to be maintaining

2:23:07.280 --> 2:23:09.040
 three or four different logical arguments

2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:10.560
 and jumping back and forth

2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:11.280
 it's occasionally

2:23:11.280 --> 2:23:13.760
 getting to like a real streak of linearity

2:23:13.760 --> 2:23:14.320
 but

2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:15.920
 as we found today

2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:16.640
 that typically

2:23:16.640 --> 2:23:17.760
 there's three or four different things

2:23:17.760 --> 2:23:18.960
 that we're bouncing back and forth from

2:23:18.960 --> 2:23:19.920
 and that requires

2:23:19.920 --> 2:23:21.680
 a lot of updating of these

2:23:21.680 --> 2:23:22.880
 you know for brain circuits

2:23:22.880 --> 2:23:23.440
 it's not

2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:25.760
 it's not a passive listening experience

2:23:25.760 --> 2:23:26.400
 but

2:23:26.400 --> 2:23:28.160
 I like to think that the brain likes that

2:23:28.720 --> 2:23:29.680
 I do want to ask

2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:31.840
 because we all

2:23:31.840 --> 2:23:32.800
 I don't want to forget

2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:36.160
 the question came up to me

2:23:36.160 --> 2:23:37.680
 is your podcast

2:23:38.640 --> 2:23:40.400
 has the same kind of rigor

2:23:40.400 --> 2:23:42.960
 that I think like a Dan Carlin podcast

2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:43.200
 has

2:23:43.200 --> 2:23:44.800
 who's a history podcaster

2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:46.720
 well that's a

2:23:46.720 --> 2:23:47.840
 definitely a compliment

2:23:47.840 --> 2:23:48.400
 thank you

2:23:48.400 --> 2:23:48.720
 it feels like

2:23:48.720 --> 2:23:50.160
 Dan's Dan's way

2:23:50.160 --> 2:23:50.480
 you know

2:23:50.480 --> 2:23:52.160
 he's something for me to aspire to

2:23:52.160 --> 2:23:54.320
 so he goes through hell to prepare

2:23:54.320 --> 2:23:55.200
 he spends

2:23:55.200 --> 2:23:56.240
 months preparing

2:23:56.240 --> 2:23:56.960
 it feels like

2:23:58.240 --> 2:24:00.960
 you've had to really prepare for your podcast

2:24:00.960 --> 2:24:02.000
 I definitely

2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:02.960
 prepare hard

2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:03.840
 how

2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:04.480
 does that

2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:05.120
 are you okay

2:24:06.640 --> 2:24:07.360
 yeah I

2:24:07.360 --> 2:24:09.360
 I mean how much effort does that take

2:24:09.360 --> 2:24:11.440
 it feels like a conference presentation

2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:13.200
 yeah so we record once a week

2:24:13.200 --> 2:24:15.280
 and in the intervening time

2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:16.080
 I

2:24:16.080 --> 2:24:16.800
 listen to

2:24:19.120 --> 2:24:20.080
 many

2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:21.280
 university level lectures

2:24:21.280 --> 2:24:22.480
 so NIH has a

2:24:23.440 --> 2:24:25.040
 a bank of lectures

2:24:25.040 --> 2:24:26.800
 I have some sources of

2:24:26.800 --> 2:24:28.880
 recorded university seminars

2:24:28.880 --> 2:24:30.480
 I'm trying to find the

2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:31.840
 the points of intersection

2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:33.520
 so like for four episodes on sleep

2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:34.480
 it's not like I'm going to

2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:36.400
 just regurgitate a popular book

2:24:36.400 --> 2:24:38.000
 or take one lecture and just

2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:38.480
 you know

2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:39.280
 poach the content

2:24:39.280 --> 2:24:39.840
 I'm going to

2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:40.720
 find the overlap

2:24:41.280 --> 2:24:42.720
 in the different elements

2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:44.240
 I also

2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:45.680
 so what I'll do is I'll generally

2:24:46.560 --> 2:24:47.120
 read

2:24:47.120 --> 2:24:47.840
 10 or 15

2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:48.560
 to papers

2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:50.960
 and generally those are good reviews

2:24:50.960 --> 2:24:51.920
 annual reviews

2:24:51.920 --> 2:24:53.040
 and a review of neuroscience

2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:54.320
 annual review of physiology

2:24:54.320 --> 2:24:55.360
 those kinds of things

2:24:55.360 --> 2:24:56.720
 I'll chase a few references

2:24:56.720 --> 2:24:58.160
 I'll listen to some YouTube videos

2:24:58.160 --> 2:24:59.680
 but of university level lectures

2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:00.720
 and then

2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:03.280
 I throw all that on a whiteboard

2:25:03.280 --> 2:25:04.960
 usually while I work out in the morning

2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:06.720
 I'll just be working out

2:25:06.720 --> 2:25:07.760
 I have a gym in my house

2:25:07.760 --> 2:25:09.200
 and I'll just put up

2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:10.160
 all these random ideas

2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:10.960
 I want to cover that

2:25:10.960 --> 2:25:12.240
 dreams hallucination

2:25:12.240 --> 2:25:13.440
 and then I take that

2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:14.560
 and I start to eliminate

2:25:14.560 --> 2:25:15.200
 I draw lines

2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:17.280
 between the common points of intersection

2:25:17.280 --> 2:25:18.560
 and then from that

2:25:18.560 --> 2:25:20.640
 I distill out and outline

2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:22.800
 and then I basically

2:25:23.520 --> 2:25:24.960
 think about what I want to say

2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:26.320
 on my walks with my dog

2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:28.480
 and I bother a couple people

2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:29.200
 and blab to them

2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:30.480
 so I would say each podcast

2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:32.640
 yeah I put in 10 to 15 hours

2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:34.880
 at least of passive listening

2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:35.520
 preparation

2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:36.800
 and maybe five or six

2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:38.080
 of active preparation

2:25:38.640 --> 2:25:40.800
 so I do prepare quite a lot

2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:43.280
 but it has a certain reward component

2:25:43.280 --> 2:25:43.760
 for me

2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:45.600
 I to come up at the end

2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:46.400
 with something that's

2:25:46.400 --> 2:25:48.000
 somewhat crystallized

2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.080
 for me is just so satisfying

2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:51.440
 it feel like there's something

2:25:51.440 --> 2:25:52.720
 about my dopamine circuits

2:25:52.720 --> 2:25:53.760
 that just love that

2:25:54.400 --> 2:25:57.200
 and the only pain is that

2:25:57.200 --> 2:25:57.920
 a year later

2:25:57.920 --> 2:25:59.200
 after I've talked about the stuff

2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:00.000
 a bunch of times

2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:01.440
 it's so much more succinct

2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:03.520
 but that's life

2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:04.560
 at some point

2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:05.600
 you got to pull the trigger

2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:08.240
 well I don't know what you think

2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:09.600
 but for me YouTube

2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:13.280
 is that's why I'm sad that Joe left YouTube

2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:15.840
 there's a archival nature to YouTube

2:26:15.840 --> 2:26:16.800
 that's kind of magical

2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:18.240
 and so I'm really glad you're now

2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:23.600
 you're doing a lot of educational content

2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:24.560
 on Instagram before

2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:25.840
 but now

2:26:27.200 --> 2:26:29.280
 doing this podcast thing on YouTube

2:26:29.280 --> 2:26:30.080
 it's like a

2:26:30.080 --> 2:26:30.480
 you know

2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:31.760
 it's like Feynman lectures

2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:32.640
 like

2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:33.200
 well that's very

2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:35.760
 I'm not saying every podcast

2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:37.200
 but there will be

2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:38.080
 you will have some

2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:39.280
 I could already tell

2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:41.280
 there'll be some lectures

2:26:42.720 --> 2:26:43.440
 which are like

2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:45.200
 definitive

2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:47.200
 like really special ones

2:26:47.200 --> 2:26:48.080
 that's the hope

2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:50.240
 and there's some aspect

2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:51.680
 that's archival to YouTube

2:26:51.680 --> 2:26:53.520
 where at least I hope

2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:54.720
 like 20 years from now

2:26:54.720 --> 2:26:55.760
 some kid is going to watch

2:26:57.040 --> 2:26:58.160
 watch a lecture of yours

2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:00.160
 and you know

2:27:00.160 --> 2:27:02.320
 it'll create the next Nobel Prize

2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:02.640
 right

2:27:02.640 --> 2:27:03.440
 it'll create

2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:04.240
 it'll create another

2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:06.160
 you know

2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:08.160
 a dream that then becomes a reality

2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:09.040
 and then that's a

2:27:09.040 --> 2:27:10.000
 that's a special thing

2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:12.400
 that the YouTube provides

2:27:12.400 --> 2:27:14.000
 I'm really excited that you're on YouTube

2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:15.360
 and at the same time

2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:17.280
 I'm excited to see where this thing goes

2:27:17.280 --> 2:27:17.680
 because

2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:20.960
 it seems like change is the

2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:22.800
 the cliche thing

2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:24.320
 the change is the only constant

2:27:24.320 --> 2:27:25.200
 in these times

2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:25.520
 because

2:27:27.120 --> 2:27:27.920
 you're paving

2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:29.680
 with this podcast

2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:31.040
 with this creativity

2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:32.800
 what you were doing on Instagram as well

2:27:32.800 --> 2:27:34.800
 you're paving the new era

2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:37.040
 of what it means to do science

2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:38.800
 so actively doing research

2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:41.520
 and actively explaining that research

2:27:41.520 --> 2:27:42.400
 in new media

2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:42.800
 it's

2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:44.240
 it's very interesting

2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:45.520
 just inspired

2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:47.120
 genuinely inspired by you

2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:49.120
 we had this discussion last time

2:27:49.120 --> 2:27:51.360
 after the podcast recording

2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:52.320
 and it was

2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:54.480
 it's clear that communication of science

2:27:54.480 --> 2:27:55.680
 cannot be left

2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:56.320
 to the

2:27:56.320 --> 2:27:56.960
 the

2:27:56.960 --> 2:27:58.560
 existing institutions

2:27:58.560 --> 2:27:59.680
 and I'm going to talk about universities

2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:00.800
 I just mean that the

2:28:00.800 --> 2:28:02.400
 science section of newspapers is

2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:05.760
 sometimes there's some gems there but

2:28:05.760 --> 2:28:06.560
 generally it goes

2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:08.000
 you know

2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:08.640
 and

2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:10.400
 yeah I think you really have to know a field

2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:13.600
 in order to extract the best things from that field

2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:14.160
 and

2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:15.520
 my hope is that other

2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:16.720
 practicing scientists

2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:18.320
 and people finishing their PhD

2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:19.040
 and postdoc

2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:20.240
 and people who are running labs

2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:21.120
 or working at companies

2:28:21.120 --> 2:28:22.080
 will start to do this

2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:24.080
 I mean how amazing would it be for instance

2:28:24.080 --> 2:28:24.640
 if

2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:26.800
 if someone at Neuralink

2:28:27.760 --> 2:28:28.080
 was

2:28:28.800 --> 2:28:30.400
 giving us hints about

2:28:30.400 --> 2:28:31.920
 not necessarily what they're developing

2:28:31.920 --> 2:28:32.720
 because that's

2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:34.480
 complicated for all sorts of reasons but

2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:36.080
 would

2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:37.360
 talk to us about

2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:39.840
 what the real challenge is

2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:40.560
 of building

2:28:41.120 --> 2:28:42.000
 futuristic

2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:43.120
 brain machine interface

2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:43.600
 are like

2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:44.000
 and

2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:44.720
 and what the

2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:46.880
 what it means to understand a clinical problem

2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:47.520
 and address it

2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:47.840
 I mean

2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:48.560
 I

2:28:48.560 --> 2:28:49.520
 my hope is somebody there

2:28:49.520 --> 2:28:50.640
 might eventually do that

2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:52.160
 that somebody in the world of

2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:53.600
 chemistry

2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:55.120
 or synthetic materials

2:28:55.120 --> 2:28:55.840
 or whatever it is

2:28:55.840 --> 2:28:57.600
 will do this in a way that I could understand

2:28:57.600 --> 2:28:58.480
 because I don't have

2:28:58.480 --> 2:28:59.840
 expertise in those

2:28:59.840 --> 2:29:00.240
 I think

2:29:00.960 --> 2:29:02.160
 it would be marvelous

2:29:02.160 --> 2:29:02.400
 and

2:29:03.040 --> 2:29:03.920
 you were tip of the spear

2:29:03.920 --> 2:29:05.040
 you were out first

2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:05.920
 and

2:29:05.920 --> 2:29:06.400
 I'm just

2:29:07.840 --> 2:29:09.040
 happily trying to

2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:10.640
 to move along in the direction I'm going

2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:11.040
 but I

2:29:11.040 --> 2:29:13.040
 I think the future of science education

2:29:13.040 --> 2:29:13.760
 is online

2:29:15.520 --> 2:29:16.080
 and

2:29:16.080 --> 2:29:18.160
 I think that's going to be scary to a lot of

2:29:18.160 --> 2:29:19.280
 existing institutions

2:29:19.280 --> 2:29:20.400
 but it's not about

2:29:20.400 --> 2:29:21.440
 disrupting anything

2:29:21.440 --> 2:29:23.200
 it's just about trying to do things better

2:29:23.200 --> 2:29:24.000
 yeah

2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:25.040
 you know some of the best

2:29:26.560 --> 2:29:27.360
 interviews

2:29:28.640 --> 2:29:29.440
 some of the best

2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:30.800
 investigative journalism

2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:32.720
 is done by people inside the field

2:29:33.520 --> 2:29:36.000
 comes to mind a guy by the name of Elon Musk

2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:36.160
 who

2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:38.080
 who uh

2:29:38.080 --> 2:29:39.520
 I love the the possibility

2:29:39.520 --> 2:29:40.400
 that he gets a poll

2:29:40.400 --> 2:29:41.360
 it's there for that interview

2:29:41.920 --> 2:29:42.320
 but uh

2:29:42.320 --> 2:29:44.000
 he grilled the crap out of Vlad

2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:44.960
 the uh CEO

2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:46.240
 Robin Hood

2:29:46.240 --> 2:29:46.960
 I'm not sure if you know

2:29:46.960 --> 2:29:47.680
 oh and um

2:29:48.400 --> 2:29:49.280
 on the clubhouse

2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:50.240
 on clubhouse the other night

2:29:50.240 --> 2:29:51.760
 yeah I saw you guys in there

2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:52.560
 I was kept out

2:29:52.560 --> 2:29:53.680
 I wasn't quick enough

2:29:53.680 --> 2:29:55.200
 my thumb doesn't go fast enough

2:29:55.200 --> 2:29:55.680
 so I was

2:29:55.680 --> 2:29:57.360
 and I wasn't about to sit in the waiting room

2:29:57.360 --> 2:29:58.720
 have you tried that social network

2:29:58.720 --> 2:29:59.760
 by the way the clubhouse

2:29:59.760 --> 2:30:01.280
 I've gone in there a few times

2:30:01.280 --> 2:30:02.320
 and check some things out

2:30:02.880 --> 2:30:03.760
 I'm there

2:30:03.760 --> 2:30:05.120
 I have a few questions about it that

2:30:05.680 --> 2:30:06.720
 like if I'm in there

2:30:06.720 --> 2:30:07.280
 where

2:30:07.280 --> 2:30:07.840
 it

2:30:07.840 --> 2:30:08.400
 how one

2:30:09.360 --> 2:30:10.160
 can participate

2:30:10.160 --> 2:30:11.120
 or not participate

2:30:11.120 --> 2:30:11.520
 I

2:30:11.520 --> 2:30:12.800
 I like being a fly on the wall

2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:13.760
 for those conversations

2:30:13.760 --> 2:30:14.560
 I've been very curious

2:30:14.560 --> 2:30:15.600
 as to what's going on in there

2:30:15.600 --> 2:30:16.560
 oh it's quite

2:30:16.560 --> 2:30:18.080
 I mean I have a lot of thoughts

2:30:18.080 --> 2:30:18.640
 I've

2:30:18.640 --> 2:30:20.080
 maybe it's useful to comment

2:30:20.800 --> 2:30:22.400
 I also have a discord server

2:30:23.280 --> 2:30:24.080
 that uh

2:30:24.080 --> 2:30:24.640
 you know has

2:30:25.440 --> 2:30:27.520
 a few tens of thousands of people on it

2:30:27.520 --> 2:30:28.160
 and then

2:30:28.160 --> 2:30:29.040
 they have

2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:30.400
 also a voice

2:30:30.400 --> 2:30:31.760
 chat capability

2:30:31.760 --> 2:30:33.920
 so there's these get togethers

2:30:33.920 --> 2:30:34.720
 and I

2:30:34.720 --> 2:30:35.760
 I was using it in

2:30:35.760 --> 2:30:37.040
 in the spring and summer

2:30:37.600 --> 2:30:38.400
 like actively

2:30:38.960 --> 2:30:40.480
 on those voice discussions

2:30:40.480 --> 2:30:40.800
 and it's

2:30:41.360 --> 2:30:43.680
 anywhere from 10 to like a thousand people

2:30:44.800 --> 2:30:46.320
 all together in voice

2:30:46.320 --> 2:30:47.200
 like you

2:30:47.200 --> 2:30:48.160
 anyone can speak

2:30:48.160 --> 2:30:49.040
 anytime right

2:30:49.040 --> 2:30:50.960
 but there's this weird dynamic

2:30:50.960 --> 2:30:52.080
 that people stay quiet

2:30:52.080 --> 2:30:53.600
 only one person speaks at a time

2:30:53.600 --> 2:30:54.000
 interesting

2:30:54.000 --> 2:30:55.360
 because they're all like respectful

2:30:55.360 --> 2:30:56.720
 and it's a community of like

2:30:58.000 --> 2:30:58.560
 like

2:30:58.560 --> 2:31:00.080
 fundamentally respectful people

2:31:00.080 --> 2:31:01.680
 even though they're all anonymous

2:31:01.680 --> 2:31:02.400
 so like

2:31:02.400 --> 2:31:04.080
 except like me and a few others

2:31:04.080 --> 2:31:06.080
 it's all anonymous people

2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:06.960
 so interesting

2:31:06.960 --> 2:31:07.680
 and it works

2:31:07.680 --> 2:31:08.160
 it's

2:31:08.160 --> 2:31:09.120
 but the

2:31:09.120 --> 2:31:10.880
 the magical thing to me

2:31:10.880 --> 2:31:11.200
 about

2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:12.960
 that community

2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:15.360
 was how intimate

2:31:15.360 --> 2:31:17.040
 voice only communication can be

2:31:18.400 --> 2:31:19.040
 it felt

2:31:19.600 --> 2:31:20.880
 as intimate as

2:31:21.680 --> 2:31:22.080
 like a

2:31:22.640 --> 2:31:24.560
 like a small get together

2:31:24.560 --> 2:31:25.600
 at a home

2:31:25.600 --> 2:31:26.560
 with close friends

2:31:27.600 --> 2:31:29.760
 it felt like there's a calmness to it

2:31:29.760 --> 2:31:32.240
 and you're revealing things about

2:31:32.240 --> 2:31:33.600
 about you know

2:31:33.600 --> 2:31:35.360
 somebody suffering from depression

2:31:35.360 --> 2:31:36.960
 or being suicidal

2:31:36.960 --> 2:31:38.480
 so those are the dark things

2:31:38.480 --> 2:31:39.520
 or being super excited

2:31:39.520 --> 2:31:40.640
 getting a new girlfriend

2:31:40.640 --> 2:31:41.920
 or boyfriend

2:31:41.920 --> 2:31:45.040
 like just the depth of human experience

2:31:45.040 --> 2:31:46.480
 shared on voice

2:31:46.480 --> 2:31:47.200
 without video

2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:48.720
 is uh

2:31:48.720 --> 2:31:50.640
 I was really surprised how intimate that is

2:31:50.640 --> 2:31:51.920
 for human connection

2:31:51.920 --> 2:31:53.360
 especially in this time of COVID

2:31:53.360 --> 2:31:54.320
 it replaced that

2:31:54.320 --> 2:31:55.120
 so that

2:31:55.120 --> 2:31:55.680
 so that

2:31:55.680 --> 2:31:57.360
 so just to give you some context

2:31:57.360 --> 2:31:58.560
 there's something there

2:31:58.560 --> 2:32:00.000
 there's definitely something there

2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:00.800
 one thing that

2:32:00.800 --> 2:32:01.840
 comes to mind is

2:32:01.840 --> 2:32:02.960
 when like in clubhouse

2:32:02.960 --> 2:32:04.160
 you have your little icon

2:32:04.160 --> 2:32:04.960
 so they don't actually

2:32:04.960 --> 2:32:06.240
 you don't see your face moving

2:32:06.240 --> 2:32:08.080
 I think when people see their own image

2:32:08.720 --> 2:32:11.440
 it puts them in a state of self consciousness

2:32:11.440 --> 2:32:12.880
 that is eliminated

2:32:12.880 --> 2:32:14.000
 by just having an icon

2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:14.720
 or an avatar

2:32:14.720 --> 2:32:15.200
 yes

2:32:15.200 --> 2:32:15.520
 right

2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:16.320
 so like zoom

2:32:16.960 --> 2:32:18.400
 is dreadful

2:32:18.400 --> 2:32:19.520
 because if

2:32:19.520 --> 2:32:20.880
 I'm not used to talking to people

2:32:20.880 --> 2:32:22.320
 and seeing a little image of myself

2:32:22.320 --> 2:32:23.680
 staring back at me in the mirror

2:32:24.240 --> 2:32:24.480
 and

2:32:25.200 --> 2:32:25.840
 it's just

2:32:25.840 --> 2:32:27.440
 I know there are ways that you can adjust that

2:32:27.440 --> 2:32:29.200
 but it's really awful

2:32:29.200 --> 2:32:29.840
 and I think that

2:32:30.400 --> 2:32:31.520
 when I get on zooms now

2:32:31.520 --> 2:32:32.080
 I say hello

2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:33.280
 and then I shut down

2:32:33.280 --> 2:32:34.400
 the video component

2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:35.520
 and then I just talk in the end

2:32:35.520 --> 2:32:36.320
 I come back on

2:32:36.320 --> 2:32:37.200
 just to show that

2:32:37.200 --> 2:32:37.680
 still there

2:32:37.680 --> 2:32:38.720
 it's told me

2:32:38.720 --> 2:32:39.280
 but

2:32:39.280 --> 2:32:39.840
 I think that

2:32:40.480 --> 2:32:42.000
 voice only is really interesting

2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:42.720
 Eddie Chang

2:32:42.720 --> 2:32:43.680
 would be an interesting person

2:32:43.680 --> 2:32:44.480
 to talk to about this

2:32:44.480 --> 2:32:45.440
 because he understands

2:32:45.440 --> 2:32:46.000
 so much about

2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:47.600
 how inflection communicates

2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:48.960
 emotionality

2:32:48.960 --> 2:32:50.000
 in deeper state

2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:51.520
 but there's a balance between

2:32:52.160 --> 2:32:53.280
 I think just like you said

2:32:53.280 --> 2:32:54.400
 there's the privacy

2:32:55.840 --> 2:32:56.320
 somehow

2:32:57.680 --> 2:32:58.960
 allows for the intimacy

2:32:58.960 --> 2:32:59.920
 so like being able to

2:32:59.920 --> 2:33:00.640
 to

2:33:00.640 --> 2:33:01.040
 uh

2:33:01.040 --> 2:33:03.120
 as opposed to putting on an act

2:33:03.120 --> 2:33:04.320
 which I realized we do

2:33:04.320 --> 2:33:06.320
 when we're visually presenting ourselves

2:33:06.320 --> 2:33:07.680
 in remote communication

2:33:08.240 --> 2:33:08.880
 but I think that

2:33:08.880 --> 2:33:09.920
 there's so few places

2:33:09.920 --> 2:33:11.600
 where people can actually

2:33:11.600 --> 2:33:12.720
 communicate without

2:33:12.720 --> 2:33:14.160
 the fear of penalty

2:33:14.160 --> 2:33:14.800
 yes

2:33:14.800 --> 2:33:15.360
 those

2:33:15.360 --> 2:33:15.680
 that's

2:33:16.720 --> 2:33:17.120
 you know

2:33:17.120 --> 2:33:18.160
 woefully

2:33:18.160 --> 2:33:19.200
 absent these days

2:33:19.200 --> 2:33:20.560
 and so maybe people are just

2:33:20.560 --> 2:33:21.760
 relieved to be in a place

2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:22.880
 where they feel like

2:33:22.880 --> 2:33:24.000
 I can say what I want

2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:25.280
 or not say anything

2:33:25.280 --> 2:33:26.320
 and it's okay

2:33:26.320 --> 2:33:26.880
 and so

2:33:26.880 --> 2:33:27.760
 so clubhouse

2:33:27.760 --> 2:33:29.280
 as you to answer your kind of

2:33:29.280 --> 2:33:29.840
 question is

2:33:31.040 --> 2:33:32.080
 there was a big improvement

2:33:32.080 --> 2:33:33.040
 to me over discord

2:33:33.040 --> 2:33:33.680
 which is

2:33:33.680 --> 2:33:34.640
 it has tears

2:33:34.640 --> 2:33:35.360
 is

2:33:35.360 --> 2:33:36.640
 it has a stage

2:33:36.640 --> 2:33:37.680
 where people

2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:38.960
 the person that created the room

2:33:38.960 --> 2:33:40.240
 can invite people up

2:33:40.240 --> 2:33:42.480
 that would like to speak potentially

2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:43.680
 have the opportunity to speak

2:33:43.680 --> 2:33:45.200
 and then there's a bigger audience

2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:47.360
 that don't get a chance to speak

2:33:47.360 --> 2:33:48.240
 unless they

2:33:48.240 --> 2:33:49.360
 click raise their hand

2:33:49.360 --> 2:33:50.880
 and then get called on

2:33:50.880 --> 2:33:52.000
 so there's like a tier

2:33:52.960 --> 2:33:53.440
 system

2:33:53.440 --> 2:33:55.280
 that allows for there to be

2:33:56.320 --> 2:33:57.440
 a group of like

2:33:57.440 --> 2:34:00.160
 five, 10, 20, 30 people talking

2:34:00.160 --> 2:34:01.680
 and a lot larger

2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:03.200
 amount in the audience

2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:04.000
 which in discord

2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:04.480
 is the problem

2:34:04.480 --> 2:34:06.000
 is that everybody could talk

2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:07.520
 and the other thing about clubhouse

2:34:07.520 --> 2:34:08.240
 is everybody

2:34:09.440 --> 2:34:10.400
 is strongly encouraged

2:34:10.400 --> 2:34:11.440
 to represent themselves

2:34:11.440 --> 2:34:12.960
 so you're using your real name

2:34:12.960 --> 2:34:13.920
 it's not anonymous

2:34:14.800 --> 2:34:16.160
 and how many people were in that

2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:18.640
 GameStop discussion the other day

2:34:18.640 --> 2:34:19.680
 they currently

2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:23.200
 limit rooms to five thousand

2:34:23.200 --> 2:34:25.120
 so I'm sure maxed out of five thousand

2:34:25.120 --> 2:34:26.800
 there's a lot of overflow rooms

2:34:26.800 --> 2:34:28.400
 this is the cool thing

2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:29.520
 about clubhouse

2:34:29.520 --> 2:34:31.280
 really big people were on there

2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:32.080
 all tuned in

2:34:32.080 --> 2:34:33.440
 and having a conversation

2:34:33.440 --> 2:34:35.040
 having all from

2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:35.840
 you know

2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:37.920
 all these different worlds

2:34:37.920 --> 2:34:39.600
 being able to connect

2:34:39.600 --> 2:34:40.240
 even though

2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:41.520
 without the niceties

2:34:41.520 --> 2:34:43.120
 of like arranging the meeting

2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:44.080
 you could just show up

2:34:44.080 --> 2:34:44.640
 and leave

2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:45.760
 which is nice

2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:47.360
 but the reason I'm

2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:49.920
 for my lessons from discord

2:34:51.120 --> 2:34:53.200
 I'm going to mostly stay away

2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:54.000
 from clubhouse

2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:54.960
 and I think

2:34:54.960 --> 2:34:57.600
 we're going there under another name

2:34:57.600 --> 2:34:58.240
 right

2:34:59.840 --> 2:35:01.360
 I'll pretend I know the actual

2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:02.400
 your actual name one

2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:02.640
 yeah

2:35:04.160 --> 2:35:05.040
 is I've learned

2:35:05.040 --> 2:35:06.240
 it's quite addicting

2:35:07.280 --> 2:35:08.400
 it's a time sink

2:35:08.400 --> 2:35:09.040
 it's so

2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:10.080
 the intimacy of it

2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:12.800
 is you find yourself wasting

2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:14.080
 quite a bit of time on there

2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:14.880
 it pulls you in

2:35:15.440 --> 2:35:16.640
 well it's interesting

2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:16.880
 the

2:35:17.840 --> 2:35:18.560
 which

2:35:18.560 --> 2:35:20.640
 in sort of going back to the podcast

2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:22.320
 or earlier we were talking about books

2:35:22.320 --> 2:35:24.400
 or creating a technology

2:35:24.400 --> 2:35:25.840
 one thing that's absolutely clear

2:35:25.840 --> 2:35:27.120
 is that anything

2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:28.880
 that's easy to reproduce

2:35:28.880 --> 2:35:30.480
 is probably not worth

2:35:31.120 --> 2:35:31.840
 much effort

2:35:32.480 --> 2:35:33.280
 and time

2:35:33.280 --> 2:35:33.840
 yes

2:35:33.840 --> 2:35:34.400
 right I mean

2:35:35.840 --> 2:35:36.640
 most posts

2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:39.120
 could be easily reproduced

2:35:39.120 --> 2:35:40.160
 you just repost them

2:35:40.160 --> 2:35:40.560
 yeah

2:35:40.560 --> 2:35:40.800
 so

2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:43.440
 now there are some original posts

2:35:43.440 --> 2:35:44.800
 that for which the attribution

2:35:44.800 --> 2:35:46.000
 goes to the original person

2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:47.120
 and it's clear it came from you

2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:49.440
 but anything that can be easily

2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:50.320
 reproduced is

2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:52.640
 doesn't really expand us very much

2:35:52.640 --> 2:35:53.520
 as individuals

2:35:53.520 --> 2:35:55.120
 or or as groups

2:35:55.120 --> 2:35:56.880
 and most of what I see on social media

2:35:56.880 --> 2:35:58.320
 is stuff that could

2:35:58.320 --> 2:36:00.240
 is is purely reproduced

2:36:00.240 --> 2:36:01.360
 yes right

2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:01.520
 but

2:36:03.680 --> 2:36:04.720
 I think clubhouse

2:36:04.720 --> 2:36:05.200
 I mean

2:36:05.200 --> 2:36:06.640
 it could be that some real magic

2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:07.600
 emerges on there

2:36:08.160 --> 2:36:09.520
 so in moderation

2:36:09.520 --> 2:36:10.080
 it could be good

2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:11.360
 the magic is

2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:12.400
 this is another thing

2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:13.760
 that I've found

2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:14.960
 through COVID

2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:16.240
 that maybe you can think about

2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:19.040
 is live

2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:21.360
 I used to be

2:36:21.360 --> 2:36:23.200
 not understand the appeal

2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:24.400
 of live video

2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:25.440
 or live connection

2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:26.960
 or like in this clubhouse

2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:27.760
 live events

2:36:28.720 --> 2:36:29.760
 because clubhouse

2:36:30.400 --> 2:36:31.520
 is technically

2:36:31.520 --> 2:36:32.240
 for the most part

2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:33.920
 it's not supposed to be recorded

2:36:33.920 --> 2:36:35.200
 most people don't record

2:36:35.200 --> 2:36:36.400
 most conversations

2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:37.920
 it's a one time live event

2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:40.080
 and there's a magic to that

2:36:40.080 --> 2:36:40.800
 there is

2:36:40.800 --> 2:36:42.400
 that's not captured by

2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:44.480
 like your podcast

2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:44.640
 or

2:36:45.360 --> 2:36:46.240
 my podcast

2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:47.200
 produced video

2:36:47.200 --> 2:36:48.000
 that's like

2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:48.640
 recorded

2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:50.800
 like packaged up

2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:52.240
 well anything can happen

2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:54.080
 it's that anything can happen

2:36:54.080 --> 2:36:54.880
 and those

2:36:54.880 --> 2:36:55.680
 that's the kind of thing

2:36:55.680 --> 2:36:57.200
 like live concerts

2:36:57.200 --> 2:36:58.560
 and I definitely

2:36:58.560 --> 2:36:59.680
 I love live music

2:37:00.320 --> 2:37:01.840
 and it's the idea that

2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:02.560
 because you can always listen

2:37:02.560 --> 2:37:03.280
 to the album

2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:04.240
 actually the album usually

2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:05.680
 sounds cleaner and better

2:37:05.680 --> 2:37:06.640
 but it's just this idea

2:37:06.640 --> 2:37:08.160
 that anything can happen

2:37:08.160 --> 2:37:09.280
 and then you listen to like

2:37:09.280 --> 2:37:10.160
 the parts

2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:10.880
 I don't know you

2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:13.600
 like Castello did something weird

2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:15.040
 your dog did something weird

2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:16.240
 and then you have to go

2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:16.880
 god damn it

2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:18.080
 you have to go to the kitchen

2:37:18.080 --> 2:37:18.880
 or something

2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:19.600
 to get something

2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:20.560
 and then you come back

2:37:20.560 --> 2:37:22.160
 and it's funny

2:37:22.160 --> 2:37:23.760
 I watched a live video like that

2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:24.480
 of people

2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:26.240
 and I'll be there for the whole time

2:37:26.240 --> 2:37:27.040
 I'll wait for them

2:37:27.040 --> 2:37:27.920
 to go to the kitchen

2:37:27.920 --> 2:37:28.640
 and come back

2:37:28.640 --> 2:37:29.920
 it's not like I tune out

2:37:29.920 --> 2:37:30.560
 right

2:37:30.560 --> 2:37:31.520
 and that makes it like

2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:32.640
 a richer experience

2:37:32.640 --> 2:37:33.360
 for some reason

2:37:33.360 --> 2:37:34.000
 it's weird

2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:35.200
 well it humanizes it

2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:36.320
 yeah humanizes it

2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:37.440
 and I think there is this

2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:38.560
 weird effect of

2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:38.960
 whether or not

2:37:38.960 --> 2:37:39.680
 it's a podcast

2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:40.160
 Instagram

2:37:40.160 --> 2:37:40.640
 or Twitter

2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:41.120
 or anything else

2:37:41.120 --> 2:37:41.920
 there's kind of like

2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:43.680
 two people shouting

2:37:43.680 --> 2:37:44.320
 into a tunnel

2:37:44.320 --> 2:37:45.200
 and then a bunch of people

2:37:45.200 --> 2:37:46.240
 with ears at the other end

2:37:46.240 --> 2:37:46.960
 of those tunnels

2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:47.600
 and shouting

2:37:47.600 --> 2:37:48.400
 some things back

2:37:48.400 --> 2:37:49.920
 and you know that's

2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:52.000
 that's kind of the format we're in

2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:52.800
 I think

2:37:52.800 --> 2:37:54.000
 I'll check out Clubhouse again

2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:54.480
 I've gone in there

2:37:54.480 --> 2:37:55.520
 a few times during the day

2:37:55.520 --> 2:37:56.480
 and I was surprised to see

2:37:56.480 --> 2:37:57.360
 how many people were in there

2:37:57.360 --> 2:37:58.400
 in the middle of the day

2:37:58.400 --> 2:37:58.800
 I was like

2:37:58.800 --> 2:37:59.040
 don't know

2:37:59.040 --> 2:37:59.520
 aren't these people

2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:00.240
 supposed to be working

2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:02.240
 but maybe that is their work

2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:03.280
 well be very careful

2:38:03.280 --> 2:38:03.760
 about the

2:38:05.360 --> 2:38:06.960
 the time sinker of it

2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:07.440
 but yeah

2:38:07.440 --> 2:38:08.000
 if you want to

2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:08.960
 you and I go together

2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:10.160
 we'll have a good conversation

2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:10.720
 on there

2:38:10.720 --> 2:38:11.760
 but one of the things

2:38:11.760 --> 2:38:12.560
 you have to figure out

2:38:13.200 --> 2:38:14.400
 I don't still know

2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:15.200
 how to do it

2:38:15.200 --> 2:38:16.240
 but how to exit

2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:18.240
 which is like

2:38:18.240 --> 2:38:18.880
 isn't there the

2:38:18.880 --> 2:38:19.840
 leave quietly button

2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:20.400
 yeah

2:38:20.400 --> 2:38:20.640
 no

2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:21.760
 but like when you and I

2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:22.480
 are on stage

2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:23.520
 having a conversation

2:38:25.440 --> 2:38:25.520
 like

2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:26.240
 and okay

2:38:26.240 --> 2:38:27.680
 you and I is harder

2:38:27.680 --> 2:38:28.160
 but like

2:38:29.280 --> 2:38:30.080
 you really

2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:31.120
 if it's just you and I

2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:32.160
 then it's the usual

2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:33.120
 human communication

2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:33.600
 of like

2:38:33.600 --> 2:38:34.000
 all right

2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:34.560
 I gotta go

2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:35.680
 like

2:38:35.680 --> 2:38:36.560
 but when it's like

2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:37.200
 four people

2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:39.600
 you don't want to interrupt

2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:40.000
 everyone

2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:40.880
 announced you're leaving

2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:41.440
 you just have to

2:38:41.440 --> 2:38:41.920
 I mean

2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:43.040
 there's a weird dynamic

2:38:43.040 --> 2:38:44.400
 that I haven't quite figured out

2:38:45.440 --> 2:38:45.760
 of

2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:46.960
 the etiquette isn't clear

2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:48.160
 the etiquette is not clear

2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:49.840
 well what it

2:38:49.840 --> 2:38:51.920
 the etiquette on different platforms

2:38:51.920 --> 2:38:52.880
 and how that changes

2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:54.000
 is really interesting

2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:54.320
 you know

2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:56.240
 how youtube has one etiquette

2:38:56.240 --> 2:38:57.120
 which is kind of

2:38:57.120 --> 2:38:58.160
 it's a lot of harshness

2:38:58.160 --> 2:38:59.360
 is tolerated on youtube

2:38:59.360 --> 2:38:59.920
 video

2:38:59.920 --> 2:39:00.320
 comments

2:39:01.120 --> 2:39:02.160
 twitter seems a bit

2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:03.840
 harsher than instagram

2:39:03.840 --> 2:39:04.720
 instagram there's kind

2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:04.800
 yeah

2:39:04.800 --> 2:39:06.000
 it seems to be a little nice

2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:07.440
 people are really nice

2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:08.720
 people are really nice

2:39:08.720 --> 2:39:09.280
 on instagram

2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:10.080
 for the most part

2:39:11.200 --> 2:39:11.920
 except for those

2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:13.440
 phishing things

2:39:13.440 --> 2:39:14.480
 I actually know someone

2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:15.120
 who had their

2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:16.800
 quite sizable account

2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:17.600
 poached by those

2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:18.400
 copyright

2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:19.600
 they come in with those like

2:39:19.600 --> 2:39:20.320
 you violated

2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:21.600
 copyright thing

2:39:21.600 --> 2:39:22.800
 there's all sorts of harshness

2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:23.360
 in there

2:39:23.360 --> 2:39:24.320
 that if you think about it

2:39:24.320 --> 2:39:25.200
 in the real world

2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:26.080
 I like to think about

2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:27.280
 instagram as if it was the real

2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:28.160
 world

2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:29.120
 someone that comes over

2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:30.320
 is basically saying like

2:39:30.320 --> 2:39:30.640
 hey

2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:31.600
 can I hold your wallet

2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:32.320
 and go into the bank

2:39:32.320 --> 2:39:33.520
 and I'll get some money out for you

2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:34.000
 and like

2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:35.280
 but there's this trust

2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:37.120
 based on the format it comes in

2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:38.640
 that it can almost get past your

2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:39.040
 radar

2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:40.080
 unless you're suspicious

2:39:40.880 --> 2:39:41.200
 if

2:39:41.200 --> 2:39:41.680
 if you took

2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:43.040
 comments like

2:39:43.040 --> 2:39:43.440
 you know

2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:44.800
 you post get a lot of comments

2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:45.280
 and use it

2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:46.880
 you just walk past

2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:48.480
 500 random people on the street

2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:49.760
 and just listen to what they say

2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:51.040
 it

2:39:51.040 --> 2:39:51.920
 like that's ridiculous

2:39:51.920 --> 2:39:53.440
 I don't have time for that

2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:54.400
 but the comments somehow

2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:55.440
 take on this importance

2:39:55.440 --> 2:39:56.720
 and this relevance

2:39:56.720 --> 2:39:57.440
 and you feel

2:39:58.000 --> 2:39:59.120
 we feel obligated

2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:00.400
 to give them value

2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:00.960
 right

2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:01.840
 and so

2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:03.520
 the online communities

2:40:03.520 --> 2:40:05.360
 the rules really are different

2:40:06.560 --> 2:40:07.440
 and they evolve with time

2:40:07.440 --> 2:40:08.080
 which is fascinating

2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:08.800
 with clubhouse

2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:09.920
 it's a new social network

2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:10.960
 so it's evolving

2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:12.560
 and people are figuring out

2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:13.120
 as you go

2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:14.240
 and the same thing

2:40:14.240 --> 2:40:15.520
 with podcasting

2:40:15.520 --> 2:40:16.320
 on video

2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:18.080
 and like scientific podcasting

2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:18.880
 this is the cool thing

2:40:18.880 --> 2:40:19.840
 when I look at

2:40:19.840 --> 2:40:20.880
 what you've created

2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:22.720
 I'm learning

2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:23.600
 I'm thinking like

2:40:23.600 --> 2:40:24.160
 hmm

2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:26.240
 that's interesting to do it this way

2:40:26.240 --> 2:40:26.800
 because like

2:40:26.800 --> 2:40:27.280
 nobody

2:40:27.280 --> 2:40:28.480
 I have nobody to copy

2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:30.480
 not many people to copy

2:40:30.480 --> 2:40:31.040
 you know what I mean

2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:32.400
 but you threw out an idea

2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:33.680
 I'm not going to put it out here now

2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:34.160
 because I

2:40:34.160 --> 2:40:35.120
 I don't want to

2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:35.920
 because knowing you

2:40:35.920 --> 2:40:37.040
 you'll hold yourself to it

2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:37.520
 no matter what

2:40:37.520 --> 2:40:38.640
 but when we talked about

2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:40.160
 this issue

2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:42.000
 the challenge of staying

2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:43.280
 on a particular topic for a while

2:40:43.840 --> 2:40:44.160
 I mean

2:40:44.160 --> 2:40:45.280
 you do have some cool stuff

2:40:45.280 --> 2:40:46.000
 brewing in there

2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:46.480
 oh no no no

2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:47.920
 that's separate from this format

2:40:47.920 --> 2:40:49.840
 and I love your interview format

2:40:49.840 --> 2:40:50.000
 but

2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:51.840
 when you told me about that

2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:52.880
 I got really excited

2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:53.920
 that you might go forward with

2:40:53.920 --> 2:40:54.960
 I'm not going to tell your audience

2:40:54.960 --> 2:40:55.760
 what it is

2:40:55.760 --> 2:40:56.880
 but I will say this

2:40:56.880 --> 2:40:58.560
 it is super cool

2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:00.080
 I would have never thought about it

2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:00.880
 it's distinctly different

2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:01.520
 than what I'm doing

2:41:01.520 --> 2:41:03.200
 or what Lex is currently doing

2:41:03.200 --> 2:41:05.440
 and if you decide

2:41:05.440 --> 2:41:07.360
 to do that podcast

2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:08.640
 I will be your first

2:41:08.640 --> 2:41:09.840
 and your number one fan

2:41:09.840 --> 2:41:11.680
 and I know there are going to be millions of other

2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:12.400
 people interested in that

2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:13.840
 would be amazing

2:41:13.840 --> 2:41:15.840
 so if you decide to go forward

2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:16.560
 with the idea

2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:19.120
 that would be awesome

2:41:19.120 --> 2:41:20.080
 I was going to say what it is

2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:21.040
 but now I'm not going to

2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:23.520
 because that's even more interesting

2:41:24.160 --> 2:41:26.240
 I brought up the clubhouse thing

2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:27.200
 actually in Elon

2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:29.440
 because I just wanted to

2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:32.000
 get your thoughts about

2:41:32.640 --> 2:41:34.080
 something he's said a few times

2:41:34.720 --> 2:41:36.240
 to me and in general

2:41:37.120 --> 2:41:39.200
 is that he's under a huge amount of stress

2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:41.760
 and I'm thinking of

2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:43.680
 doing a startup

2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:44.800
 now it kind of

2:41:44.800 --> 2:41:45.680
 I'm not

2:41:45.680 --> 2:41:46.880
 thinking about all of this

2:41:47.840 --> 2:41:48.480
 because I

2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:49.600
 you know I enjoy podcasts

2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:50.480
 I enjoy science

2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:52.640
 but he says that

2:41:52.640 --> 2:41:53.440
 his life is

2:41:54.160 --> 2:41:54.960
 basically hell

2:41:55.760 --> 2:41:57.040
 that's very difficult

2:41:57.040 --> 2:41:58.080
 he looks happy

2:41:58.080 --> 2:41:59.680
 but he's probably very good at

2:41:59.680 --> 2:42:01.040
 he's fulfilled

2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:02.160
 he's fulfilled

2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:04.080
 but the stress levels

2:42:04.080 --> 2:42:05.040
 the constant

2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:07.600
 fires that he has to put out

2:42:08.320 --> 2:42:09.680
 and he says that most people

2:42:09.680 --> 2:42:10.720
 wouldn't want to be me

2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:12.480
 and that

2:42:13.040 --> 2:42:13.840
 basically the

2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:16.240
 reason he does what he does is

2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:16.560
 because

2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:19.200
 there's probably something wrong with him

2:42:19.760 --> 2:42:20.640
 like it's not a

2:42:21.840 --> 2:42:23.040
 he can't help it

2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:24.000
 but do that

2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:24.800
 it's kind of beautiful

2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:26.560
 in a kind of

2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:27.360
 Russian

2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:28.560
 massacistic way

2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:30.800
 I just wonder

2:42:30.800 --> 2:42:31.600
 the stress

2:42:31.600 --> 2:42:32.720
 I mean I'm sure you can

2:42:33.840 --> 2:42:35.360
 you can imagine the kind of stress

2:42:35.360 --> 2:42:35.920
 he's under

2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:36.560
 because

2:42:36.560 --> 2:42:39.120
 so it's running three plus companies

2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:41.120
 and there's constant

2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:44.160
 and he says that

2:42:44.800 --> 2:42:45.760
 you know every single meeting

2:42:45.760 --> 2:42:47.200
 is not about like

2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:49.920
 should we install a coffee maker

2:42:49.920 --> 2:42:50.320
 in the

2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:51.680
 in the kitchen

2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:52.720
 it's like

2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:54.960
 you know this rocket

2:42:54.960 --> 2:42:56.160
 is going to blow up

2:42:56.160 --> 2:42:56.720
 and I don't

2:42:56.720 --> 2:42:57.600
 we're all fucked

2:42:57.600 --> 2:42:59.040
 I don't know what to do

2:42:59.040 --> 2:42:59.840
 and we have to

2:42:59.840 --> 2:43:00.560
 you have to fix

2:43:01.120 --> 2:43:02.800
 you have to fix a real like

2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:03.920
 big problems that are

2:43:03.920 --> 2:43:04.720
 and like how do you

2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:06.640
 oh yeah

2:43:06.640 --> 2:43:07.600
 how do you deal with that

2:43:07.600 --> 2:43:09.280
 what do you think about that kind of life

2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:11.200
 one is there a way to

2:43:11.200 --> 2:43:12.720
 you know walk through that fire

2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:14.640
 and two

2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:16.240
 should you

2:43:17.200 --> 2:43:18.720
 should you walk through that fire

2:43:19.280 --> 2:43:20.240
 well I mean

2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:21.040
 without knowing

2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:22.000
 I've never met Elon

2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:22.720
 but certainly

2:43:22.720 --> 2:43:23.440
 we have

2:43:23.440 --> 2:43:24.720
 common friends

2:43:24.720 --> 2:43:25.760
 in you

2:43:25.760 --> 2:43:26.720
 and in

2:43:26.720 --> 2:43:27.440
 other people that

2:43:28.160 --> 2:43:29.520
 he worked with long ago

2:43:29.520 --> 2:43:30.560
 in the PayPal days

2:43:32.080 --> 2:43:33.920
 all of whom speak very highly of him

2:43:33.920 --> 2:43:34.720
 and show

2:43:35.600 --> 2:43:37.360
 express immense admiration

2:43:37.360 --> 2:43:38.560
 for the number of things

2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:39.920
 that he can maintain

2:43:39.920 --> 2:43:41.360
 I think it's fair to say that

2:43:41.360 --> 2:43:43.040
 he accomplishes more

2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:44.880
 before 9 a.m. than

2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:45.920
 most people do in

2:43:45.920 --> 2:43:46.080
 in

2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:48.320
 a decade

2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:49.200
 it's clear

2:43:49.200 --> 2:43:50.400
 and that what he does

2:43:50.400 --> 2:43:51.680
 would dissolve most people

2:43:51.680 --> 2:43:53.280
 into a puddle of tears

2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:54.560
 mostly because of this whole thing

2:43:56.320 --> 2:43:58.240
 about the brain working hard

2:43:59.200 --> 2:43:59.840
 equates to

2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:01.600
 thinking about duration path

2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:02.160
 and outcome

2:44:02.160 --> 2:44:03.760
 and anticipating outcomes

2:44:03.760 --> 2:44:04.960
 given A, B, C or D

2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:05.760
 a lot of

2:44:05.760 --> 2:44:07.440
 very scripted linear thinking

2:44:07.440 --> 2:44:09.200
 and prediction

2:44:09.200 --> 2:44:10.880
 and that is hard

2:44:10.880 --> 2:44:11.520
 it's stressful

2:44:11.520 --> 2:44:12.800
 it requires intense

2:44:12.800 --> 2:44:14.160
 neurochemical output

2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:14.880
 and he's doing that

2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:16.320
 for multiple projects

2:44:16.320 --> 2:44:17.360
 so presumably

2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:18.560
 he's buffered himself

2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:20.160
 from the coffee maker issues

2:44:20.160 --> 2:44:21.280
 and the little tiny issues

2:44:21.280 --> 2:44:22.240
 but he is it

2:44:22.240 --> 2:44:22.880
 himself

2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:24.000
 unless there's something I don't know

2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:24.880
 he's walking around

2:44:24.880 --> 2:44:26.480
 in a biological system

2:44:26.480 --> 2:44:26.800
 he is

2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:28.400
 that's

2:44:28.400 --> 2:44:29.120
 allegedly

2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:29.440
 yes

2:44:29.440 --> 2:44:30.240
 yeah allegedly

2:44:30.240 --> 2:44:30.480
 so

2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:33.760
 and I don't want to reveal too much here

2:44:33.760 --> 2:44:34.320
 but I have

2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:36.560
 a common

2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:38.720
 a co worker

2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:39.280
 and colleague

2:44:39.280 --> 2:44:40.640
 through some contract work I do

2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:41.440
 that

2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:42.880
 what I can tell you

2:44:42.880 --> 2:44:44.160
 is that he's accessing

2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:45.280
 the best resources

2:44:45.280 --> 2:44:46.720
 in terms of how to optimize

2:44:46.720 --> 2:44:47.680
 his biology

2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:48.640
 and

2:44:49.600 --> 2:44:50.880
 he's thinking about that

2:44:50.880 --> 2:44:51.840
 not just for himself

2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:53.360
 but for all of Neuralink

2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:54.000
 because I think

2:44:54.880 --> 2:44:56.000
 I'm not trying to dodge the question

2:44:56.000 --> 2:44:56.480
 but I think

2:44:57.520 --> 2:44:59.440
 there's the scale of the individual

2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:00.720
 but then there's the companies

2:45:00.720 --> 2:45:02.640
 that he's creating

2:45:02.640 --> 2:45:03.760
 and you've got people there

2:45:03.760 --> 2:45:04.560
 that

2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:05.280
 you could imagine

2:45:05.280 --> 2:45:06.080
 if they're working

2:45:06.080 --> 2:45:07.680
 at 10% better capacity

2:45:07.680 --> 2:45:08.720
 or can focus

2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:10.000
 5% better for

2:45:10.640 --> 2:45:12.240
 20% of the day

2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:13.520
 you're looking at a

2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:14.560
 enormous increase

2:45:14.560 --> 2:45:15.680
 in productivity

2:45:15.680 --> 2:45:16.800
 and a reduction

2:45:16.800 --> 2:45:18.000
 in the time to reach goals

2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:18.480
 which will

2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:20.320
 reduce the amount of stress

2:45:20.320 --> 2:45:21.280
 presumably on Elon

2:45:21.280 --> 2:45:22.160
 unless he goes and starts

2:45:22.160 --> 2:45:22.960
 another endeavor

2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:24.000
 right

2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:25.040
 so I think

2:45:25.680 --> 2:45:26.320
 it's

2:45:26.320 --> 2:45:27.280
 certainly not healthy

2:45:27.280 --> 2:45:28.080
 for most people

2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:29.520
 it seems to be

2:45:29.520 --> 2:45:31.200
 where he gets his dopamine hits

2:45:31.200 --> 2:45:31.920
 I'm also

2:45:31.920 --> 2:45:32.960
 really struck by the fact

2:45:32.960 --> 2:45:34.240
 that he has a family

2:45:34.240 --> 2:45:35.120
 and he has

2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:35.440
 you know

2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:37.200
 he's got kids growing up

2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:38.080
 and a relationship

2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:38.560
 and all that

2:45:38.560 --> 2:45:39.040
 so

2:45:39.040 --> 2:45:40.160
 it's super impressive

2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:41.680
 I think that

2:45:42.960 --> 2:45:44.160
 I don't know how old is Elon

2:45:44.720 --> 2:45:45.280
 yes

2:45:45.280 --> 2:45:45.840
 40

2:45:45.840 --> 2:45:47.200
 I'm pushing 50

2:45:47.200 --> 2:45:48.160
 I think 48

2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:49.280
 so

2:45:49.280 --> 2:45:50.240
 even more impressive

2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:51.840
 because

2:45:51.840 --> 2:45:52.400
 you know

2:45:52.400 --> 2:45:53.920
 many people who've been at

2:45:53.920 --> 2:45:55.360
 exceedingly high output

2:45:55.360 --> 2:45:56.720
 for a decade or more

2:45:56.720 --> 2:45:57.520
 don't

2:45:57.520 --> 2:45:58.480
 do well

2:45:58.480 --> 2:45:59.840
 their system breaks down

2:45:59.840 --> 2:46:00.960
 well this is what he was

2:46:00.960 --> 2:46:02.400
 saying he

2:46:03.200 --> 2:46:03.520
 actually

2:46:04.560 --> 2:46:05.760
 I mean I don't listen to

2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:06.640
 all of his interviews

2:46:06.640 --> 2:46:06.880
 but

2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:08.640
 on that live

2:46:08.640 --> 2:46:09.440
 on the clubhouse

2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:10.320
 he mentioned that

2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:12.640
 he was kind of worried

2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:14.000
 it's interesting

2:46:14.720 --> 2:46:15.840
 he was worried that

2:46:15.840 --> 2:46:16.320
 like

2:46:16.320 --> 2:46:17.040
 sometimes

2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:20.240
 what I think he said is

2:46:20.240 --> 2:46:21.200
 I'm worried that

2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:23.120
 at some point

2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:24.800
 my brain is just going to fail

2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:26.960
 because of the amount

2:46:26.960 --> 2:46:28.080
 of load it's under

2:46:28.080 --> 2:46:30.560
 like how much I have to

2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:32.400
 think through

2:46:33.040 --> 2:46:33.920
 throughout the day

2:46:33.920 --> 2:46:34.640
 like how many

2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:37.200
 problems you have to think

2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:37.520
 through

2:46:38.080 --> 2:46:38.640
 like you know

2:46:38.640 --> 2:46:39.680
 it's like puzzles

2:46:39.680 --> 2:46:41.120
 it's constant puzzle solving

2:46:41.120 --> 2:46:42.160
 I would be concerned about

2:46:42.880 --> 2:46:43.760
 taking somebody

2:46:43.760 --> 2:46:44.720
 who's in that regime

2:46:44.720 --> 2:46:45.840
 and suddenly putting them

2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:46.560
 into a regime

2:46:46.560 --> 2:46:47.280
 where they don't have

2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:48.320
 enough to bite down into

2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:49.680
 it's like my bulldog Costello

2:46:49.680 --> 2:46:50.320
 he's happiest

2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:51.440
 when chewing and tugging

2:46:51.440 --> 2:46:53.040
 that big old neck of his

2:46:53.040 --> 2:46:54.080
 and he is just not going to

2:46:54.080 --> 2:46:54.960
 become a retriever

2:46:54.960 --> 2:46:55.920
 he's not going to

2:46:55.920 --> 2:46:57.440
 that he does well

2:46:57.440 --> 2:46:58.880
 and gets his dopamine hits

2:46:58.880 --> 2:47:00.640
 from chewing and pulling

2:47:00.640 --> 2:47:02.720
 and it seems like Ilan has

2:47:02.720 --> 2:47:04.160
 ended up where he is

2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:05.040
 by way of his

2:47:05.920 --> 2:47:06.960
 natural leanings

2:47:07.680 --> 2:47:09.360
 unless there's a back story

2:47:09.360 --> 2:47:09.600
 that's

2:47:10.960 --> 2:47:11.680
 trauma based

2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:12.080
 or something

2:47:12.080 --> 2:47:13.440
 and I don't even begin

2:47:13.440 --> 2:47:14.560
 to think that there is

2:47:15.200 --> 2:47:16.640
 it seems that he has

2:47:16.640 --> 2:47:18.160
 he's one of those rare individuals

2:47:18.160 --> 2:47:18.560
 in history

2:47:18.560 --> 2:47:20.400
 that has an immense drive

2:47:20.400 --> 2:47:21.520
 to create in

2:47:21.520 --> 2:47:22.560
 all these different domains

2:47:22.560 --> 2:47:24.240
 I'm just saying the obvious here

2:47:24.240 --> 2:47:25.520
 but it seems like

2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:26.640
 that's what makes him tick

2:47:26.640 --> 2:47:28.640
 I mean, you're doing an awful lot too

2:47:28.640 --> 2:47:30.640
 well, but the problem is

2:47:30.640 --> 2:47:31.600
 not really

2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:33.520
 the problem is

2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:35.520
 about I've been

2:47:35.520 --> 2:47:36.960
 on the verge of pulling the trigger

2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:39.440
 on starting a company

2:47:39.440 --> 2:47:40.400
 which will increase

2:47:40.400 --> 2:47:42.320
 the workload significantly

2:47:43.040 --> 2:47:45.440
 and I'm attracted to that

2:47:46.800 --> 2:47:48.320
 because of a dream I have

2:47:48.960 --> 2:47:50.880
 but it's a little bit scary

2:47:51.840 --> 2:47:53.280
 because it can destroy you

2:47:54.880 --> 2:47:56.160
 in a lot of ways

2:47:56.160 --> 2:47:58.960
 there's two sources of destruction

2:47:58.960 --> 2:48:00.320
 so one source

2:48:01.600 --> 2:48:01.840
 is

2:48:03.840 --> 2:48:05.520
 I've for the first time

2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:06.240
 in my life

2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:06.640
 a few

2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:09.440
 months ago

2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:10.240
 I think

2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:10.880
 have gotten

2:48:12.160 --> 2:48:13.920
 it feels like such a noob thing to say

2:48:13.920 --> 2:48:15.120
 but I've gotten some hate

2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:15.920
 on the internet

2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:16.960
 no

2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:18.160
 I know right

2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:18.720
 no

2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:19.440
 but like

2:48:19.440 --> 2:48:20.480
 I am such an idiot

2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:21.600
 I'm so naive to

2:48:22.240 --> 2:48:22.880
 it was super

2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:25.440
 I had the question

2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:26.560
 that I guess a lot of people

2:48:27.520 --> 2:48:28.720
 have when they get hate

2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:29.200
 on the internet

2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:29.520
 it's like

2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:31.280
 it's like

2:48:31.280 --> 2:48:31.840
 mom

2:48:31.840 --> 2:48:32.800
 why are these people

2:48:32.800 --> 2:48:34.480
 making up stuff about me

2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:35.280
 you know

2:48:35.280 --> 2:48:36.720
 that kind of feeling of like

2:48:36.720 --> 2:48:38.320
 why why are you saying that

2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:39.120
 and

2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:40.640
 and the

2:48:41.600 --> 2:48:43.280
 the reason I mentioned that is like

2:48:43.280 --> 2:48:44.080
 well if you go

2:48:44.080 --> 2:48:45.040
 if you want to go

2:48:45.040 --> 2:48:46.240
 and start a business

2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:47.040
 and do

2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:49.600
 as I think people should

2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:50.880
 when they start a big

2:48:51.840 --> 2:48:53.360
 ambitious business

2:48:53.360 --> 2:48:55.680
 really try to go big

2:48:55.680 --> 2:48:55.920
 like

2:48:56.480 --> 2:48:57.920
 what does success look like

2:48:57.920 --> 2:48:59.920
 in terms of your emotional journey

2:49:00.640 --> 2:49:02.640
 you're going to have a lot of people who

2:49:03.280 --> 2:49:05.040
 make up stuff about you

2:49:05.040 --> 2:49:06.000
 who say

2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:06.720
 negative

2:49:06.720 --> 2:49:07.760
 majority hopefully

2:49:07.760 --> 2:49:09.120
 if you do a good job

2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:10.160
 will be supportive

2:49:10.160 --> 2:49:10.800
 and

2:49:10.800 --> 2:49:11.840
 but there's still going to be

2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:12.800
 this army of people

2:49:13.600 --> 2:49:14.160
 and like

2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:15.600
 that that was scary to me

2:49:16.240 --> 2:49:17.760
 because of how

2:49:17.760 --> 2:49:19.280
 much emotional impact

2:49:19.280 --> 2:49:20.400
 they had on me

2:49:20.400 --> 2:49:22.000
 well and I also know

2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:22.720
 a little bit

2:49:22.720 --> 2:49:24.320
 I have some glimpse into the fact that

2:49:24.320 --> 2:49:25.680
 you put your heart and soul

2:49:25.680 --> 2:49:27.200
 into everything you do

2:49:27.200 --> 2:49:28.240
 you're not a

2:49:28.240 --> 2:49:29.680
 you're lighthearted about

2:49:29.680 --> 2:49:30.560
 certain things

2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:30.960
 but

2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:33.040
 you're even lighthearted about being

2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:34.560
 full gas pedal

2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:35.840
 24 seven

2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:36.640
 there's kind of this

2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:38.160
 you know

2:49:38.160 --> 2:49:38.560
 was it

2:49:40.160 --> 2:49:40.560
 was it

2:49:40.560 --> 2:49:41.840
 Laird Hamilton always says

2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:43.120
 you know the big wave surfers

2:49:43.760 --> 2:49:44.320
 he always says

2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:44.560
 you know

2:49:45.200 --> 2:49:46.400
 bright light dark shadow

2:49:47.120 --> 2:49:47.520
 you know

2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:48.880
 and I think

2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:50.640
 it's that intensity

2:49:50.640 --> 2:49:51.600
 and when you do that

2:49:51.600 --> 2:49:53.040
 and then suddenly

2:49:53.040 --> 2:49:54.720
 people are starting to like

2:49:54.720 --> 2:49:55.600
 throw some paint

2:49:55.600 --> 2:49:56.240
 on your picture

2:49:56.240 --> 2:49:56.800
 you're like

2:49:56.800 --> 2:49:57.600
 wait hold

2:49:57.600 --> 2:49:57.840
 you know

2:49:57.840 --> 2:49:59.920
 you're going max capacity

2:49:59.920 --> 2:50:01.280
 but I think the company

2:50:01.280 --> 2:50:02.080
 is an interesting one

2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:03.200
 because you've talked about

2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:04.320
 doing this company before

2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:05.600
 I've been afraid

2:50:05.600 --> 2:50:07.200
 I just not been pulling trigger

2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:09.200
 out of fear

2:50:09.200 --> 2:50:10.320
 because I enjoy this life

2:50:10.320 --> 2:50:10.880
 this is

2:50:10.880 --> 2:50:11.200
 this is

2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:11.920
 I'm starting to interrupt

2:50:11.920 --> 2:50:13.120
 but it's ultimately

2:50:13.120 --> 2:50:14.480
 this question of

2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:15.840
 taking a leap

2:50:15.840 --> 2:50:16.240
 is like

2:50:17.760 --> 2:50:19.040
 say you're in academia

2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:20.160
 like you're at MIT

2:50:20.160 --> 2:50:20.960
 you're

2:50:20.960 --> 2:50:22.960
 I really love doing research at MIT

2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:24.880
 I really love that life

2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:26.480
 why take a leap out

2:50:27.040 --> 2:50:27.360
 you know

2:50:27.360 --> 2:50:27.920
 but I did

2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:30.320
 because it's been a dream

2:50:30.320 --> 2:50:31.040
 but now

2:50:31.040 --> 2:50:32.560
 accidentally along the way

2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:34.960
 I found this podcasting thing

2:50:35.680 --> 2:50:37.760
 which is also really fulfilling

2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:38.480
 and you know

2:50:39.040 --> 2:50:39.440
 it's like

2:50:39.440 --> 2:50:40.320
 why take a leap

2:50:40.960 --> 2:50:42.160
 because you have a huge

2:50:42.800 --> 2:50:44.080
 lust for life

2:50:44.080 --> 2:50:44.560
 yeah

2:50:44.560 --> 2:50:45.360
 I mean that's you

2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:46.080
 I mean

2:50:46.080 --> 2:50:47.280
 sometimes when I'm on the internet

2:50:47.280 --> 2:50:48.080
 and I think is this

2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:48.960
 you hear about it

2:50:48.960 --> 2:50:49.280
 like

2:50:49.280 --> 2:50:50.160
 oh it's addicting

2:50:50.160 --> 2:50:50.560
 you know

2:50:50.560 --> 2:50:52.000
 YouTube's addicting all that

2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:52.800
 actually

2:50:52.800 --> 2:50:53.760
 sometimes I think

2:50:53.760 --> 2:50:54.560
 maybe that's true

2:50:54.560 --> 2:50:55.200
 but a lot of times

2:50:55.200 --> 2:50:56.000
 I just think

2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:57.680
 there's so much here

2:50:57.680 --> 2:50:58.560
 there's a lot of

2:50:58.560 --> 2:50:59.360
 garbage

2:50:59.360 --> 2:51:01.600
 but there's so many gems

2:51:01.600 --> 2:51:02.720
 out there in the world now

2:51:02.720 --> 2:51:03.680
 it's almost

2:51:03.680 --> 2:51:03.920
 like

2:51:04.640 --> 2:51:06.480
 sure how you allocate time is key

2:51:06.480 --> 2:51:07.040
 but

2:51:07.040 --> 2:51:07.280
 I

2:51:08.640 --> 2:51:09.680
 I think you can do it all

2:51:11.040 --> 2:51:11.440
 yeah

2:51:11.440 --> 2:51:12.880
 maybe not five more things

2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:13.440
 yeah yes

2:51:13.440 --> 2:51:14.000
 but all

2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:14.400
 yes

2:51:14.400 --> 2:51:16.080
 and one thing I just had this idea

2:51:16.080 --> 2:51:17.040
 and this is not grounded

2:51:17.040 --> 2:51:18.320
 in any scientific paper

2:51:18.320 --> 2:51:20.240
 but I think the answer might come to you

2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:20.800
 during this

2:51:22.400 --> 2:51:24.560
 this torture that you're about to get yourself through

2:51:24.560 --> 2:51:25.200
 with David

2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:26.800
 because in those mental states

2:51:26.800 --> 2:51:28.320
 you're really asking the question

2:51:28.880 --> 2:51:29.200
 right

2:51:29.200 --> 2:51:30.640
 you're asking the question

2:51:30.640 --> 2:51:32.000
 where is my capacity

2:51:32.560 --> 2:51:32.800
 and

2:51:33.440 --> 2:51:35.440
 am I even close to my capacity

2:51:35.440 --> 2:51:36.240
 and if I am

2:51:36.240 --> 2:51:36.720
 what's

2:51:36.720 --> 2:51:37.920
 what's of the most value

2:51:37.920 --> 2:51:40.240
 I think we find the answers to those things

2:51:40.240 --> 2:51:41.440
 in those nonverbal

2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:43.440
 nonanalytic states

2:51:43.440 --> 2:51:43.840
 it just

2:51:44.640 --> 2:51:45.760
 comes to us

2:51:45.760 --> 2:51:46.800
 I hope you're right

2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:48.400
 and I hope it's a

2:51:49.680 --> 2:51:51.520
 profoundly fulfilling experience

2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:54.000
 as opposed to one that leads to my demise

2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:54.400
 but

2:51:54.400 --> 2:51:55.200
 you have a will right

2:51:57.360 --> 2:51:57.760
 it goes

2:51:57.760 --> 2:51:58.640
 it all goes to the

2:51:58.640 --> 2:51:59.200
 to the hedgehog

2:51:59.200 --> 2:51:59.760
 yeah exactly

2:51:59.760 --> 2:52:00.560
 to the hedgehog

2:52:01.520 --> 2:52:02.880
 now it all makes sense

2:52:02.880 --> 2:52:03.280
 Andrew

2:52:04.240 --> 2:52:05.760
 like we talked about offline

2:52:05.760 --> 2:52:06.800
 on this podcast

2:52:06.800 --> 2:52:07.760
 I do hope we

2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:09.520
 write some stuff together

2:52:09.520 --> 2:52:10.640
 do some research together

2:52:10.640 --> 2:52:11.280
 you're

2:52:11.280 --> 2:52:11.920
 you're

2:52:11.920 --> 2:52:12.560
 you're

2:52:12.560 --> 2:52:14.320
 one of the most inspiring scientists

2:52:14.320 --> 2:52:15.760
 and

2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:17.680
 speaking of communicating to the world

2:52:18.800 --> 2:52:19.600
 so

2:52:19.600 --> 2:52:22.320
 I can't wait to see what you do with the podcast

2:52:22.320 --> 2:52:23.520
 I'm already a huge fan

2:52:23.520 --> 2:52:25.040
 I've been telling everybody about it

2:52:26.160 --> 2:52:28.080
 I can't wait to see you talk to Joe

2:52:28.960 --> 2:52:29.920
 as well soon

2:52:29.920 --> 2:52:31.600
 and I can't wait to see

2:52:31.600 --> 2:52:33.280
 what kind of paper we write together

2:52:33.280 --> 2:52:34.560
 thanks so much for talking to me

2:52:34.560 --> 2:52:35.120
 no thank you

2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:36.960
 that project is going to be a lot of fun

2:52:36.960 --> 2:52:37.520
 can't wait

2:52:37.520 --> 2:52:38.880
 and thanks again for having me on

2:52:38.880 --> 2:52:39.840
 appreciate you brother

2:52:40.960 --> 2:52:42.480
 thanks for listening to this conversation

 if that's something you've been on the fence about

2:53:02.400 --> 2:53:03.120
 and now

2:53:03.120 --> 2:53:04.480
 let me leave you with some words

2:53:04.480 --> 2:53:05.680
 from Woodrow Wilson

2:53:06.480 --> 2:53:09.120
 we should not only use the brains we have

2:53:09.120 --> 2:53:10.720
 but all that we can borrow

2:53:11.600 --> 2:53:12.560
 thank you for listening
