00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
 Well, the source of energy at the origin of life

00:01.720 --> 00:04.720
 is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

00:04.720 --> 00:08.320
 And amazingly, most of these reactions are exagonic,

00:08.320 --> 00:10.760
 which is to say, they release energy.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.280
 If you have hydrogen and CO2,

00:13.280 --> 00:15.240
 and you put them together in a Falcon tube

00:15.240 --> 00:17.320
 and you warm it up to say 50 degrees centigrade

00:17.320 --> 00:20.000
 and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,

00:20.000 --> 00:21.320
 nothing's gonna happen.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.800
 But thermodynamically, that is less stable.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.240
 Two gases, hydrogen and CO2, is less stable than cells.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.200
 What should happen is you get cells coming out.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.400
 Why doesn't that happen?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.760
 It's because of the kinetic barriers.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.360
 That's why you need the spark.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.680
 The following is a conversation with Nick Lane,

00:40.680 --> 00:43.400
 a biochemist at University College London,

00:43.400 --> 00:46.200
 and author of some of my favorite books

00:46.200 --> 00:49.640
 on biology, science and life, ever written,

00:49.640 --> 00:51.480
 including his two most recent title,

00:51.480 --> 00:54.520
 Transformer, the Deep Chemistry of Life and Death,

00:54.520 --> 00:56.960
 and the vital question,

00:56.960 --> 01:00.240
 why is life the way it is?

01:00.240 --> 01:02.320
 This is the Lux Friedman podcast.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.440
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:04.440 --> 01:05.760
 in the description.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.000
 And now, dear friends, here's Nick Lane.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.800
 Let's start with perhaps the most mysterious,

01:11.800 --> 01:16.600
 the most interesting question that we little humans

01:16.600 --> 01:18.120
 can ask of ourselves.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.640
 How did life originate on Earth?

01:20.640 --> 01:24.000
 You could ask anybody working on the subject

01:24.000 --> 01:26.880
 and you'll get a different answer from all of them.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.600
 They will be pretty passionately held opinions,

01:30.600 --> 01:32.600
 and their opinions grounded in science,

01:34.040 --> 01:35.560
 but they're still really at this point,

01:35.560 --> 01:38.840
 their opinions, because there's so much stuff to know.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.840
 That all we can ever do is get a kind of a small slice of it,

01:42.840 --> 01:44.920
 and it's the context which matters.

01:44.920 --> 01:46.560
 So I can give you my answer.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.680
 My answer is from a biologist's point of view.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.760
 That has been missing from the equation over decades,

01:54.760 --> 01:57.560
 which is, well, what does life do on Earth?

01:57.560 --> 01:58.640
 Why is it this way?

01:58.640 --> 01:59.720
 Why is it made of cells?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.320
 Why is it made of carbon?

02:01.320 --> 02:06.000
 Why is it powered by electrical charges on membranes?

02:06.000 --> 02:09.040
 There's all these interesting questions about cells

02:09.040 --> 02:10.200
 that if you then look to see,

02:10.200 --> 02:12.040
 well, is there an environment on Earth,

02:12.040 --> 02:14.240
 on the early Earth, four billion years ago,

02:14.240 --> 02:16.720
 that kind of matches the requirements of cells?

02:16.720 --> 02:17.560
 Well, there is one.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.480
 There's a very obvious one.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.040
 It's basically created by whenever you have

02:21.040 --> 02:24.720
 a wet rocky planet, you get these hydrothermal vents.

02:24.720 --> 02:28.640
 Which generate hydrogen gas in bucket loads,

02:28.640 --> 02:32.520
 and electrical charges on kind of cell like pores

02:32.520 --> 02:35.600
 that can drive the kind of chemistry that life does.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.560
 So it seems so beautiful and so obvious

02:40.520 --> 02:43.400
 that I've spent the last 10 years

02:43.400 --> 02:45.160
 or more trying to do experiments.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.200
 It turns out to be difficult, of course.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.120
 Everything's more difficult

02:48.120 --> 02:49.760
 than you ever thought it was gonna be.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.800
 But it looks, I would say, more true

02:51.800 --> 02:53.960
 rather than less true over that 10 year period.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.320
 I think I have to take a step back every now and then

02:56.320 --> 02:59.000
 and think, hang on a minute, where's this going?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.960
 I'm happy it's going in a sensible direction.

03:01.960 --> 03:06.560
 And I think then you have these other interesting dilemmas.

03:06.560 --> 03:10.840
 I mean, I'm often accused of being too focused on life

03:10.840 --> 03:15.640
 on Earth, too kind of narrow minded and inward looking,

03:15.640 --> 03:16.480
 you might say.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.880
 I'm talking about carbon, I'm talking about cells,

03:18.880 --> 03:21.600
 and maybe you or plenty of people can say to me,

03:21.600 --> 03:23.200
 ah, yeah, but life can be anything.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.760
 I have no imagination.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.080
 And maybe they're right.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.680
 But unless we can say why life here is this way

03:29.680 --> 03:31.960
 and if those reasons are fundamental reasons

03:31.960 --> 03:33.920
 or if they're just trivial reasons,

03:33.920 --> 03:36.120
 then we can't answer that question.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.720
 So I think they're fundamental reasons

03:38.720 --> 03:40.320
 and I think we need to worry about them.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.640
 Yeah, there might be some deep truth

03:41.640 --> 03:43.680
 to the puzzle here on Earth

03:43.680 --> 03:46.760
 that will resonate with other puzzles elsewhere

03:46.760 --> 03:50.280
 that will solving this particular puzzle

03:50.280 --> 03:52.000
 will give us that deeper truth.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.240
 So what do this puzzle?

03:54.240 --> 03:59.240
 You said vents, hydrogen, wet.

04:00.200 --> 04:04.440
 So chemically, what is the potion here?

04:04.440 --> 04:06.000
 How important is oxygen?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.120
 You wrote a book about this.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.280
 Yeah, and I actually just came straight here

04:09.280 --> 04:11.080
 from a conference where I was chairing a session

04:11.080 --> 04:13.840
 on whether oxygen matters or not in the history of life.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.320
 Of course it matters.

04:15.320 --> 04:18.400
 But it matters most of the origin of life to be not there.

04:18.400 --> 04:21.320
 As I see it, we have this,

04:21.320 --> 04:25.360
 I mean, life is made of carbon basically,

04:25.360 --> 04:30.280
 primarily organic molecules with carbon carbon bonds.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.920
 And the building block, the Lego brick

04:32.920 --> 04:34.000
 that we take out of the air

04:34.000 --> 04:36.520
 or take out of the oceans is carbon dioxide.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.640
 And to turn carbon dioxide into organic molecules,

04:39.640 --> 04:42.000
 we need to strap on hydrogen.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.200
 And so we need, and this is basically what life is doing.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.480
 It's hydrogenating carbon dioxide.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.480
 It's taking the hydrogen that bubbles out of the earth

04:49.480 --> 04:52.480
 in these hydrothermal vents and it sticks it on CO2.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.200
 And it's kind of really as simple as that.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.200
 And actually thermodynamically,

04:58.200 --> 05:01.040
 there's the thing that I find most troubling

05:01.040 --> 05:03.840
 is that if you do these experiments in the lab,

05:03.840 --> 05:06.040
 the molecules you get are exactly the molecules

05:06.040 --> 05:07.920
 that we see at the heart of biochemistry

05:07.920 --> 05:08.920
 and the heart of life.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.520
 Is there something to be said about

05:12.520 --> 05:17.520
 the earliest origins of that little potion,

05:18.920 --> 05:21.440
 that chemical process?

05:21.440 --> 05:23.600
 What really is the spark there?

05:24.600 --> 05:27.200
 There isn't a spark.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.520
 There is a continuous chemical reaction.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.120
 And there is kind of a spark,

05:33.120 --> 05:35.080
 but it's a continuous electrical charge

05:35.080 --> 05:37.440
 which helps drive that reaction.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.760
 It's a literally spark.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.560
 Well, the charge at least, but yes.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.120
 I mean, a spark in that sense is we tend to think

05:45.120 --> 05:46.440
 of in terms of Frankenstein,

05:46.440 --> 05:48.440
 we tend to think in terms of electricity

05:48.440 --> 05:52.080
 and one moment you zap something and it comes alive.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.560
 And what does that really mean?

05:53.560 --> 05:56.040
 You've come alive and now what's sustaining it?

05:56.040 --> 05:59.360
 Well, we are sustained by oxygen,

05:59.360 --> 06:02.160
 by this continuous chemical reaction.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.960
 And if you put a plastic bag on your head,

06:03.960 --> 06:07.080
 then you've got a minute or something before it's all over.

06:07.080 --> 06:11.000
 So some way of being able to leverage a source of energy?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.720
 Well, the source of energy at the origin of life

06:12.720 --> 06:15.720
 is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

06:15.720 --> 06:19.320
 And amazingly, most of these reactions are exagonic,

06:19.320 --> 06:21.760
 which is to say they release energy.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.280
 If you have hydrogen and CO2,

06:24.280 --> 06:26.240
 and you put them together in a Falcon tube

06:26.240 --> 06:28.320
 and you warm it up to say 50 degrees centigrade

06:28.320 --> 06:31.000
 and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,

06:31.000 --> 06:32.320
 nothing's gonna happen.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.800
 But thermodynamically, that is less stable.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.240
 Two gases hydrogen and CO2 is less stable than cells.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.080
 What should happen is you get cells coming out.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.480
 So why doesn't that happen?

06:45.480 --> 06:47.760
 It's because of the kinetic barriers.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.960
 That's why you need the spark.

06:49.960 --> 06:53.000
 Is it possible that life originated multiple times

06:53.000 --> 06:54.080
 on Earth?

06:54.080 --> 06:57.600
 The way you describe it, you make it sound so easy.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.240
 There's a long distance to go from the first bits

07:01.240 --> 07:04.160
 of prebiotic chemistry to say molecular machines

07:04.160 --> 07:05.360
 like ribosomes.

07:05.360 --> 07:09.440
 Is that the first thing that you would say is life?

07:09.440 --> 07:12.640
 Like if I introduce you to the two of you at a party,

07:12.640 --> 07:15.040
 you would say that's a living thing.

07:15.040 --> 07:19.920
 I would say as soon as we introduce genes information

07:19.920 --> 07:22.040
 into systems that are growing anyway,

07:22.040 --> 07:25.240
 so I would talk about growing protocells.

07:25.240 --> 07:30.080
 As soon as we introduce even random bits of information

07:30.080 --> 07:35.080
 into there, I'm thinking about RNA molecules, for example,

07:35.080 --> 07:36.480
 doesn't have to have any information in it.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.240
 It can be completely random sequence.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.160
 But if it's introduced into a system which is, in any case,

07:41.160 --> 07:43.680
 growing and doubling itself and reproducing itself,

07:43.680 --> 07:45.600
 then any changes in that sequence

07:45.600 --> 07:48.200
 that allow it to do so better or worse

07:48.200 --> 07:51.280
 are now selected by perfectly normal natural selection.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.320
 But the system...

07:52.320 --> 07:54.600
 So that's when it becomes alive to my mind.

07:54.600 --> 07:59.400
 That's encompassed into an object

08:00.320 --> 08:04.040
 that keeps information and involves that information

08:04.040 --> 08:06.480
 over time or changes that information over time

08:06.480 --> 08:07.400
 in response to the...

08:07.400 --> 08:11.240
 So it's always part of a cell system from the very beginning.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.520
 So is your sense that it started only once because it's difficult

08:15.520 --> 08:18.720
 or is it possible it started in multiple locations on Earth?

08:18.720 --> 08:22.280
 It's possible it started multiple occasions.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.720
 There's two provisos to that.

08:23.720 --> 08:28.880
 One of them is oxygen makes it impossible, really,

08:28.880 --> 08:29.880
 for life to start.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.880
 So as soon as we've got oxygen in the atmosphere,

08:31.880 --> 08:34.320
 then life isn't going to keep starting over.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.400
 So I often get asked by people,

08:36.400 --> 08:38.000
 why can't we have life starting?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.640
 If it's so easy, why can't life start in these vents now?

08:40.640 --> 08:42.200
 And the answer is,

08:42.200 --> 08:43.760
 if you want hydrogen to react with CO2

08:43.760 --> 08:44.600
 and there's oxygen there,

08:44.600 --> 08:46.160
 hydrogen will react with oxygen instead.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.840
 It's just you're getting explosive reaction that way.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.080
 It's rocket fuel.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.280
 So it's never going to happen.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.160
 But for the origin of life earlier than that,

08:54.160 --> 08:57.320
 all we know is that there's a single common ancestor

08:57.320 --> 08:58.160
 for all of life.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.160
 There could have been multiple origins

09:00.160 --> 09:01.880
 when they all just disappeared.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.200
 But there's a very interesting deep split in life

09:06.200 --> 09:09.040
 between bacteria and what are called archaea,

09:09.040 --> 09:11.320
 which look just the same as bacteria.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.920
 And they're not quite as diverse, but nearly.

09:14.920 --> 09:18.160
 And they are very different in their biochemistry.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.840
 And so any explanation for the origin of life

09:19.840 --> 09:22.880
 has to account as well for why they're so different

09:22.880 --> 09:24.240
 and yet so similar.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.800
 And that makes me think that life

09:26.800 --> 09:29.200
 probably did arise only once.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.000
 Can you describe the difference that's interesting there?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
 Well, how they're similar, how they're different?

09:34.000 --> 09:38.160
 Well, they're different in their membranes primarily.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.400
 They're different in things like DNA replication.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.880
 They use completely different enzymes

09:41.880 --> 09:44.680
 and the genes behind it for replicating DNA.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.440
 So they both have membranes,

09:46.440 --> 09:48.000
 both have DNA replication.

09:48.000 --> 09:48.840
 Yes.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.240
 The process of that is different.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.080
 They both have DNA.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.840
 The genetic code is identical in them both.

09:54.840 --> 09:58.560
 The way in which it's transcribed into RNA,

09:58.560 --> 10:00.920
 into the copy of a gene,

10:00.920 --> 10:03.240
 and the way that that's then translated into a protein,

10:03.240 --> 10:05.240
 that's all basically the same in both these groups.

10:05.240 --> 10:08.520
 So they clearly share a common ancestor.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.600
 It's just that they're different

10:09.600 --> 10:10.920
 in fundamental ways as well.

10:10.920 --> 10:11.760
 And if you think about, well,

10:11.760 --> 10:15.400
 what kind of processes could drive that divergence

10:15.400 --> 10:16.480
 very early on?

10:17.960 --> 10:19.720
 I can think about it in terms of membranes,

10:19.720 --> 10:22.600
 in terms of the electrical charges on membranes.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.760
 And it's that that makes me think that there was probably,

10:25.760 --> 10:27.400
 there were probably many unsuccessful attempts

10:27.400 --> 10:30.000
 at only one really successful attempt.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.800
 Can you explain why that divergence

10:31.800 --> 10:36.120
 makes you think there's one common ancestor?

10:36.120 --> 10:37.920
 Okay, can you describe that intuition?

10:37.920 --> 10:40.320
 I'm a little bit unclear about why the divert,

10:40.320 --> 10:43.640
 like the leap from the divergence means there's one.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.960
 Do you mean like the divergence indicates

10:46.960 --> 10:51.840
 that there was a big invention at that time from one source?

10:51.840 --> 10:54.600
 If you'd got, as I imagine it,

10:54.600 --> 10:59.080
 you have a common ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.400
 Let's say there are millions of vents

11:01.400 --> 11:04.080
 and millions of potential common ancestors

11:04.080 --> 11:05.960
 living in all of those vents,

11:05.960 --> 11:09.440
 but only one of them makes it out first.

11:09.440 --> 11:11.120
 Then you could imagine that that cell

11:11.120 --> 11:12.640
 is then gonna kind of take over the world

11:12.640 --> 11:14.400
 and wipe out everything else.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.520
 And so what you would see would be

11:16.520 --> 11:18.880
 a single common ancestor for all of life,

11:18.880 --> 11:21.440
 but with lots of different vent systems

11:21.440 --> 11:24.760
 and all kind of vying to create the first life forms,

11:24.760 --> 11:25.600
 you might say.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.360
 So this thing is a cell, a single cell organism.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.600
 We're always talking about populations of cells,

11:30.600 --> 11:33.800
 but yes, these are celled organisms.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.840
 But the fundamental life form is a single cell, right?

11:37.840 --> 11:42.000
 So like, or, so they're always together,

11:42.000 --> 11:43.560
 but they're alone together.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.840
 There's a machinery in each one individual component

11:47.840 --> 11:50.800
 that if left by itself would still work.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.720
 Yes, yes, yes.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.640
 It's the unit of selection is a single cell,

11:54.640 --> 11:56.760
 but selection operates over generations

11:56.760 --> 11:59.600
 and changes over generations in populations of cells.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.360
 So it would be impossible to say that a cell

12:01.360 --> 12:04.320
 is the unit of selection in the sense that

12:04.320 --> 12:06.080
 unless you have a population you can't evolve,

12:06.080 --> 12:07.400
 you can't change.

12:07.400 --> 12:12.400
 Right, but there was one Chuck Norris,

12:12.400 --> 12:15.440
 it's an American reference cell

12:15.440 --> 12:17.960
 that made it out of the vents, right?

12:17.960 --> 12:19.840
 Or like the first one.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.160
 So imagine then that there's one cell gets out

12:22.160 --> 12:23.680
 and it takes over the world.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.640
 It gets out in the water, it's like floating around.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.840
 We're deep in the ocean somewhere.

12:27.840 --> 12:31.320
 But actually two cells got out

12:31.320 --> 12:35.520
 and they appear to have got out from the same vent

12:35.520 --> 12:38.800
 because they both share the same code and everything else.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.200
 So unless all the, you know,

12:40.200 --> 12:42.240
 we've got a million different common ancestors

12:42.240 --> 12:44.200
 in all these different vents.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.080
 So either they all have the same code

12:47.080 --> 12:49.440
 and two cells spontaneously merge from different places,

12:49.440 --> 12:54.200
 or two different cells, fundamentally different cells,

12:54.200 --> 12:55.800
 came from the same place.

12:55.800 --> 12:59.360
 So either way, what are the constraints that say,

12:59.360 --> 13:01.680
 not just one came out or not half a million came out,

13:01.680 --> 13:03.360
 but two came out?

13:03.360 --> 13:05.320
 That's kind of a bit strange.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.600
 So how did they come out?

13:06.600 --> 13:09.800
 Well, they come out because what you're doing inside a vent

13:09.800 --> 13:12.720
 is you're relying on the electrical chargers down there

13:12.720 --> 13:15.520
 to power this reaction between hydrogen and CO2

13:15.520 --> 13:17.000
 to make yourself grow.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.240
 And when you leave the vent, you've got to do that yourself.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.320
 You've got to power up your own membrane.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.240
 And so the question is, well,

13:22.240 --> 13:24.840
 how do you power up your own membrane?

13:24.840 --> 13:27.240
 And the answer is, well, you need to pump.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.960
 You need to pump ions to give an electrical charge

13:29.960 --> 13:30.840
 on the membrane.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.200
 So what do the pumps look like?

13:32.200 --> 13:35.360
 Well, the pumps look different in these two groups.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.960
 It says if they both emerge from a common ancestor,

13:37.960 --> 13:39.440
 as soon as you've got that ancestor,

13:39.440 --> 13:43.800
 things move very quickly and divergently.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.880
 Why does the DNA replication look different?

13:45.880 --> 13:47.320
 Well, it's joined to the membrane.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.280
 The membranes are different.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.720
 The DNA replication is different

13:49.720 --> 13:52.400
 because it's joined to a different kind of membrane.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.640
 So there's interesting, this is detail, you may say,

13:55.640 --> 13:57.120
 but it's also fundamental

13:57.120 --> 14:00.080
 because it's about the two big divergent groups of life

14:00.080 --> 14:03.000
 on earth that seem to have diverged really early on.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.600
 It all started from one organism.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.640
 And then that organism just start replicating

14:09.640 --> 14:14.360
 the heck out of itself with some mutation of the DNA.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.320
 So like there's some,

14:16.320 --> 14:19.440
 there's a competition through the process of evolution.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.400
 They're not like trying to beat each other up.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.880
 They're just, they're just trying to live.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.720
 They just replicate us.

14:25.720 --> 14:26.560
 Yeah.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.600
 Well, you know, let's not minimize their.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.440
 Yeah.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.400
 They're just trying to chill.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.680
 They're trying to relax up in the,

14:32.680 --> 14:35.160
 but there's no sense of trying to survive.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.480
 They're replicating.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.640
 I mean, there's no sense in which they're trying

14:38.640 --> 14:39.640
 to do anything.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.040
 They're just a kind of an outgrowth of the earth,

14:42.040 --> 14:42.880
 you might say.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.800
 Of course, the aliens would describe us humans

14:44.800 --> 14:45.800
 in that same way.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.280
 They might be right.

14:47.280 --> 14:52.280
 This primitive life is just ants that are hairless,

14:52.520 --> 14:53.360
 mostly hairless.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.360
 Overgrown ants.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.640
 Overgrown ants.

14:55.640 --> 14:56.840
 Okay.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.360
 What do you think about the idea of panspermia,

14:59.360 --> 15:03.440
 that the theory that life did not originate on earth

15:03.440 --> 15:06.920
 and was planted here from outer space?

15:06.920 --> 15:08.560
 Or pseudo panspermia,

15:08.560 --> 15:10.680
 which is like the basic ingredients,

15:10.680 --> 15:12.920
 the magic that you mentioned was planted here

15:12.920 --> 15:14.680
 from elsewhere in space.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.360
 I don't find them helpful.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.840
 That's not to say they're wrong.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.760
 So pseudo transpermia,

15:20.760 --> 15:23.120
 the idea that the chemicals, the amino acids,

15:23.120 --> 15:24.800
 the nucleotides are being delivered from space.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.800
 Well, we know that happens.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.080
 It's unequivocal.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.600
 They're delivered on meteorites, comets and so on.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.840
 So what do they do next?

15:31.840 --> 15:33.120
 That's to me the question.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.960
 Well, what do they do is they stock a soup,

15:34.960 --> 15:36.680
 like presumably they land in a pond

15:36.680 --> 15:39.000
 or in an ocean or wherever they land.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.120
 And then you end up with a best possible case scenario

15:42.120 --> 15:43.920
 as you end up with a soup of nucleotides

15:43.920 --> 15:44.760
 and amino acids.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.600
 And then you have to say,

15:45.600 --> 15:46.440
 so now what happens?

15:46.440 --> 15:47.280
 And the answer is,

15:47.280 --> 15:50.800
 oh, well, they have to go become alive.

15:50.800 --> 15:51.760
 So how did they do that?

15:51.760 --> 15:54.760
 You may as well say that a miracle happened.

15:54.760 --> 15:57.120
 I don't believe in soup.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.720
 I think what we have in event is a continuous conversion,

16:00.720 --> 16:02.720
 a continuous growth, a continuous reaction,

16:02.720 --> 16:05.880
 a continuous converting a flow of molecules

16:05.880 --> 16:07.920
 into more of yourself, you might say,

16:07.920 --> 16:08.880
 even if it's a small bit.

16:08.880 --> 16:13.040
 So you've got a kind of continuous self organization

16:13.040 --> 16:14.760
 and growth from the very beginning.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.000
 You never have that in a soup.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.160
 Isn't the entire universe

16:19.160 --> 16:21.640
 and living organisms in the universe,

16:21.640 --> 16:25.000
 isn't it just a soup all the way down?

16:25.000 --> 16:25.840
 Isn't it all soup?

16:25.840 --> 16:27.760
 No, no, I mean soup almost by definition

16:27.760 --> 16:29.560
 doesn't have a structure.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.200
 But soup is a collection of ingredients

16:32.200 --> 16:34.040
 that are like randomly.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.200
 Yeah, but they're not random.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.760
 They're not, I mean, we have chemistry going on here.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.160
 We have membranes forming,

16:40.160 --> 16:43.360
 which are effective oil, water interactions.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.920
 Okay, so it feels like there's a direction to process,

16:45.920 --> 16:47.440
 like a directive process.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.880
 There are directions to processes, yeah.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.600
 And if you're starting with CO2

16:52.600 --> 16:55.560
 and you've got two reactive fluids being brought together

16:55.560 --> 16:57.680
 and they react, what are they gonna make?

16:57.680 --> 16:59.840
 Well, they make carboxylic acids,

16:59.840 --> 17:01.680
 which include the fatty acids

17:01.680 --> 17:03.000
 that make up the cell membranes.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.480
 And they form directly into bilayer membranes.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.640
 They form like soap bubbles.

17:07.640 --> 17:10.000
 It's spontaneous organization

17:10.000 --> 17:11.920
 caused by the nature of the molecules.

17:11.920 --> 17:14.000
 And those things are capable of growing

17:14.000 --> 17:16.400
 and are capable in effect of being selected

17:16.400 --> 17:18.280
 even before there are genes.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.040
 We have this, so we have a lot of order.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.520
 And that order is coming from thermodynamics.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.520
 And the thermodynamics is always

17:24.520 --> 17:27.000
 about increasing the entropy of the universe.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.440
 But if you have oil and water and they're separating,

17:30.440 --> 17:32.000
 you're increasing the entropy of the universe,

17:32.000 --> 17:33.120
 even though you've got some order,

17:33.120 --> 17:36.480
 which is the soap and the water are not missable.

17:36.480 --> 17:41.480
 Now, to come back to your first question about pan spermia

17:41.600 --> 17:45.440
 properly, that just pushes the question somewhere else.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.840
 That just, even if it's true,

17:46.840 --> 17:48.920
 maybe life did start on earth by pan spermia.

17:48.920 --> 17:52.160
 But so what are the principles

17:52.160 --> 17:55.160
 that govern the emergence of life on any planet?

17:55.160 --> 17:57.560
 It's an assumption that life started here.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.000
 And it's an assumption that it started

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
 in a hydrothermal vent

18:02.000 --> 18:04.680
 or it started in a terrestrial geothermal system.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.560
 The question is, can we work out a testable sequence

18:07.560 --> 18:10.480
 of events that would lead from one to the other one

18:10.480 --> 18:12.640
 and then test it and see if there's any truth in it or not?

18:12.640 --> 18:14.880
 With pan spermia, you can't do any of that.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.680
 But the fundamental question of pan spermia is,

18:17.680 --> 18:21.960
 do we have the machine here on earth to build life?

18:22.960 --> 18:25.680
 Is the vents enough?

18:25.680 --> 18:30.680
 Is oxygen and hydrogen and whatever the heck else we want

18:30.680 --> 18:35.680
 and some source of energy and heat, is that enough to build life?

18:35.680 --> 18:40.680
 Well, that's, of course you would say that as a human,

18:41.680 --> 18:45.680
 but there could be aliens are now chuckling at that idea.

18:45.680 --> 18:50.680
 Maybe you need some special sauce, special elsewhere sauce.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.680
 So your sense is we have everything here.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.680
 I mean, this is precisely the question.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.680
 I like to, when I'm talking in schools,

18:58.680 --> 19:00.680
 I like to start out with the idea of,

19:00.680 --> 19:02.680
 we can make a time machine.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.680
 We go back four billion years

19:04.680 --> 19:06.680
 and we go to these environments that people talk about.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.680
 We go to a deep sea hydrothermal vent.

19:08.680 --> 19:13.680
 We go to a kind of Yellowstone Park type place environment

19:13.680 --> 19:17.680
 and we find some slime that looks like we can test it.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.680
 It's made of organic molecules.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.680
 It's got a structure, which is not obviously cells,

19:21.680 --> 19:26.680
 but is this a stepping stone on the way to life or not?

19:26.680 --> 19:28.680
 How do we know?

19:28.680 --> 19:31.680
 Unless we've got an intellectual framework that says,

19:31.680 --> 19:33.680
 this is a stepping stone and that's not a step.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.680
 We'd never know.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.680
 We wouldn't know which environment to go to,

19:36.680 --> 19:38.680
 what to look for, how to say this.

19:38.680 --> 19:39.680
 So all we can ever hope for,

19:39.680 --> 19:41.680
 because we're never going to build that time machine,

19:41.680 --> 19:43.680
 is to have an intellectual framework that can explain

19:43.680 --> 19:46.680
 step by step, experiment by experiment,

19:46.680 --> 19:50.680
 how we go from a sterile inorganic planet to living cells

19:50.680 --> 19:51.680
 as we know them.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.680
 And in that framework, every time you have a choice,

19:54.680 --> 19:56.680
 it could be this way or it could be that way,

19:56.680 --> 20:00.680
 or there's lots of possible forks down that road.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.680
 Did it have to be that way?

20:02.680 --> 20:04.680
 Could it have been the other way

20:04.680 --> 20:07.680
 and would that have given you life with very different properties?

20:07.680 --> 20:11.680
 And so if you come up with a, it's a long hypothesis,

20:11.680 --> 20:13.680
 because as I say, we're going from really simple

20:13.680 --> 20:15.680
 prebiotic chemistry all the way through

20:15.680 --> 20:17.680
 to genes and molecular machines.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.680
 That's a long, long pathway.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.680
 And nobody in the field would agree on the order

20:21.680 --> 20:22.680
 in which these things happened,

20:22.680 --> 20:24.680
 which is not a bad thing because it means

20:24.680 --> 20:26.680
 that you have to go out and do some experiments

20:26.680 --> 20:29.680
 and try and demonstrate that it's possible or not possible.

20:29.680 --> 20:36.680
 It's so freaking amazing that it happened, though.

20:36.680 --> 20:41.680
 It feels like there's a direction to the thing.

20:41.680 --> 20:47.680
 Can you try to answer from a framework perspective

20:47.680 --> 20:50.680
 of what is life?

20:50.680 --> 20:56.680
 So you said there's some order and yet there's complexity.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.680
 So it's not perfectly ordered.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.680
 It's not boring.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.680
 There's still some fun in it.

21:01.680 --> 21:05.680
 And it also feels like the processes have a direction

21:05.680 --> 21:07.680
 through the selection mechanism.

21:07.680 --> 21:11.680
 They seem to be building something always better,

21:11.680 --> 21:13.680
 always improving.

21:13.680 --> 21:14.680
 I mean, maybe it's...

21:14.680 --> 21:15.680
 I mean, that's a perception.

21:15.680 --> 21:19.680
 That's our romanticization of things are always better.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.680
 Things are getting better.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.680
 We'd like to believe that.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.680
 I mean, you think about the world from the point of view

21:24.680 --> 21:27.680
 of bacteria and bacteria are the first things to emerge

21:27.680 --> 21:29.680
 from whatever environment they came from.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.680
 And they dominated the planet very, very quickly.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.680
 And they haven't really changed.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.680
 Four billion years later, they look exactly the same.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.680
 So about four billion years ago,

21:38.680 --> 21:42.680
 bacteria started to really run the show.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.680
 And then nothing happened for a while.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.680
 Nothing happened for two billion years.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.680
 Then after two billion years, we see another single event,

21:49.680 --> 21:52.680
 origin, if you like, of our own type of cell,

21:52.680 --> 21:53.680
 the eukaryotic cells.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.680
 So cells with a nucleus and lots of stuff going on inside.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.680
 Another single origin, it only happened once

21:59.680 --> 22:00.680
 in the history of life on Earth.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.680
 Maybe it happened multiple times and there's no evidence.

22:02.680 --> 22:03.680
 Everything just disappeared.

22:03.680 --> 22:06.680
 But we have to at least take it seriously

22:06.680 --> 22:09.680
 that there's something that stops bacteria

22:09.680 --> 22:12.680
 from becoming more complex because they didn't.

22:12.680 --> 22:16.680
 That's a fact that they emerged four billion years ago.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.680
 And something happened two billion years ago,

22:18.680 --> 22:20.680
 but the bacteria themselves didn't change.

22:20.680 --> 22:21.680
 They remain bacterial.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.680
 So there is no trajectory,

22:23.680 --> 22:26.680
 necessary trajectory towards great complexity

22:26.680 --> 22:27.680
 in human beings at the end of it.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.680
 It's very easy to imagine that without photosynthesis arising

22:30.680 --> 22:32.680
 or without eukaryotes arising,

22:32.680 --> 22:35.680
 that a planet could be full of bacteria and nothing else.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.680
 We'll get to that because that's a brilliant invention.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.680
 And there's a few brilliant invention along the way.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.680
 But what is life?

22:42.680 --> 22:46.680
 If you were to show up on Earth to take that time machine

22:46.680 --> 22:49.680
 and you said, asking yourself the question,

22:49.680 --> 22:51.680
 is this a stepping stone towards life?

22:51.680 --> 22:55.680
 As you step along, when you see the early bacteria,

22:55.680 --> 22:57.680
 how would you know it's life?

22:57.680 --> 23:00.680
 And then this is really important question

23:00.680 --> 23:03.680
 when you go to other planets and look for life.

23:03.680 --> 23:07.680
 Like what is the framework of telling a difference

23:07.680 --> 23:11.680
 between a rock and a bacteria?

23:11.680 --> 23:14.680
 I mean, the question's kind of both impossible to answer

23:14.680 --> 23:15.680
 and trivial at the same time.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.680
 And I don't like to answer it

23:17.680 --> 23:18.680
 because I don't think there is an answer.

23:18.680 --> 23:19.680
 I think we're trying to describe...

23:19.680 --> 23:20.680
 Those are the most fun questions.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.680
 Approach me if there's no answer.

23:22.680 --> 23:23.680
 No, there is no answer.

23:23.680 --> 23:24.680
 I mean, there's lots of...

23:24.680 --> 23:28.680
 At least 40 or 50 different definitions of life out there.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.680
 And most of them are, well...

23:30.680 --> 23:31.680
 Not convincing.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.680
 Obviously bad in one way or another.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.680
 I mean, there's freaks.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.680
 I can never remember the exact words that people use,

23:39.680 --> 23:42.680
 but there's a NASA working definition of life,

23:42.680 --> 23:46.680
 which more or less says a system which is capable

23:46.680 --> 23:49.680
 of a self sustaining system capable of evolution

23:49.680 --> 23:51.680
 or something along those lines.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.680
 And I immediately have a problem with the words self sustaining

23:55.680 --> 23:57.680
 because it's sustained by the environment.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.680
 And I know what they're getting at.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.680
 I know what they're trying to say,

24:00.680 --> 24:02.680
 but I pick a hole in that.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.680
 And there's always wags who say,

24:04.680 --> 24:07.680
 but by that definition, a rabbit is not alive.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.680
 Only a pair of rabbits would be alive

24:09.680 --> 24:12.680
 because a single rabbit is incapable of copying itself.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.680
 There's all kinds of pedantic, silly,

24:15.680 --> 24:18.680
 but also important objections to any hypothesis.

24:18.680 --> 24:21.680
 The real question is what is...

24:21.680 --> 24:24.680
 We can argue all day, or people do argue all day about,

24:24.680 --> 24:26.680
 is a virus alive or not?

24:26.680 --> 24:28.680
 And it depends on the content.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.680
 But most biologists could not agree about that.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.680
 So then what about a jumping gene, a retro element or something?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.680
 It's even simpler than a virus,

24:35.680 --> 24:39.680
 but it's capable of converting its environment

24:39.680 --> 24:41.680
 into a copy of itself.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.680
 And that's about as close.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.680
 This is not a definition,

24:44.680 --> 24:46.680
 but this is a kind of a description of life,

24:46.680 --> 24:51.680
 is that it's able to parasitize the environment.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.680
 And that goes for plants as well as animals

24:53.680 --> 24:55.680
 and bacteria and viruses

24:55.680 --> 25:00.680
 to make a relatively exact copy of themselves,

25:00.680 --> 25:03.680
 information on the exact copy of themselves.

25:03.680 --> 25:07.680
 By the way, it doesn't really have to be a copy of itself, right?

25:07.680 --> 25:08.680
 It just has to be...

25:08.680 --> 25:12.680
 You have to create something that's interesting.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.680
 The way evolution is...

25:15.680 --> 25:19.680
 So it is extremely powerful process of evolution,

25:19.680 --> 25:21.680
 which is basically make a copy yourself

25:21.680 --> 25:23.680
 and sometimes mess up a little bit.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.680
 Absolutely.

25:24.680 --> 25:25.680
 That seems to work really well.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.680
 I wonder if it's possible to...

25:27.680 --> 25:28.680
 Mess up big time.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.680
 Mess up big time as a standard, as the default.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.680
 It's called the hopeful monster.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.680
 It doesn't work.

25:35.680 --> 25:36.680
 In principle, it can.

25:36.680 --> 25:37.680
 Actually, it turns out,

25:37.680 --> 25:40.680
 I would say that this is due a reemergence.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.680
 This is some amazing work from Michael Levin.

25:43.680 --> 25:44.680
 I don't know if you came across him,

25:44.680 --> 25:46.680
 but if you haven't interviewed him,

25:46.680 --> 25:47.680
 you should interview him.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.680
 Yeah.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.680
 About, yeah.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.680
 I'm talking to him in a few days.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.680
 Oh, fantastic.

25:54.680 --> 25:58.680
 So I mentioned off, there's two people that,

25:58.680 --> 25:59.680
 if I may mention,

25:59.680 --> 26:03.680
 Andre Capati is a friend who's really admired in the AI community,

26:03.680 --> 26:08.680
 said you absolutely must talk to Michael and to Nick.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.680
 So this, of course, I'm a huge fan of yours,

26:11.680 --> 26:14.680
 so I'm really fortunate that we can actually make this happen.

26:14.680 --> 26:15.680
 Anyway, your second.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.680
 Well, Michael Levin is doing amazing work,

26:18.680 --> 26:21.680
 basically about the way in which electrical fields

26:21.680 --> 26:23.680
 control development.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.680
 And he's done some work with planarian worms,

26:26.680 --> 26:27.680
 so flat worms,

26:27.680 --> 26:29.680
 where he'll tell you all about this.

26:29.680 --> 26:30.680
 So I won't say any more than the minimum,

26:30.680 --> 26:32.680
 but basically you can cut their head off

26:32.680 --> 26:35.680
 and they'll redevelop a different, a new head.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.680
 But the head that they develop depends,

26:37.680 --> 26:42.680
 if you knock out just one iron pump in a membrane,

26:42.680 --> 26:45.680
 so you change the electrical circuitry just a little bit,

26:45.680 --> 26:47.680
 you can come up with a completely different head.

26:47.680 --> 26:48.680
 It can be a head,

26:48.680 --> 26:52.680
 which is similar to those that diverged 150 million years ago,

26:52.680 --> 26:54.680
 a head which no one's ever seen before,

26:54.680 --> 26:56.680
 a different kind of head.

26:56.680 --> 26:59.680
 Now, that is really, you might say, a hopeful monster.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.680
 This is a kind of leap into a different direction.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.680
 The only question for natural selection is, does it work?

27:04.680 --> 27:07.680
 Is the change itself feasible as a single change?

27:07.680 --> 27:08.680
 And the answer is yes,

27:08.680 --> 27:10.680
 it's just a small change to a single gene.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.680
 And the second thing is it gives rise

27:12.680 --> 27:14.680
 to a completely different morphology.

27:14.680 --> 27:15.680
 Does it work?

27:15.680 --> 27:20.680
 And if it works, that can easily be a shift.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.680
 But for it to be a speciation,

27:22.680 --> 27:24.680
 for it to continue,

27:24.680 --> 27:28.680
 for it to give rise to a different morphology over time,

27:28.680 --> 27:31.680
 then it has to be perpetuated.

27:31.680 --> 27:36.680
 So that shift, that change in that one gene

27:36.680 --> 27:40.680
 has to work well enough that it is selected and it goes on.

27:40.680 --> 27:43.680
 And copied enough times to where you can really test it.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.680
 So the likelihood it would be lost,

27:45.680 --> 27:48.680
 but there will be some occasions where it survives.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.680
 And yes, the idea that we can have sudden,

27:50.680 --> 27:52.680
 fairly abrupt changes in evolution,

27:52.680 --> 27:54.680
 I think it's time for a rebirth.

27:54.680 --> 27:58.680
 What about this idea that kind of trying to

27:58.680 --> 28:01.680
 mathematicalize a definition of life

28:01.680 --> 28:03.680
 and saying how many steps,

28:03.680 --> 28:06.680
 the shortest amount of steps it takes to build the thing.

28:06.680 --> 28:09.680
 Almost like an engineering view of it.

28:09.680 --> 28:12.680
 I like that view because I think that in a sense,

28:12.680 --> 28:16.680
 that's not very far away from what a hypothesis needs to do

28:16.680 --> 28:18.680
 to be a testable hypothesis for the origin of life.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.680
 You need to spell out, here's each step.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.680
 And here's the experiment to do for each step.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.680
 The idea that we can do it in the lab,

28:26.680 --> 28:27.680
 some people say,

28:27.680 --> 28:30.680
 well, we'll have created life within five years,

28:30.680 --> 28:33.680
 but ask them what they mean by life.

28:33.680 --> 28:36.680
 We have a planet four billion years ago

28:36.680 --> 28:39.680
 with these vent systems across the entire surface of the planet.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.680
 And we have millions of years if we wanted.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.680
 I have a feeling that we're not talking about millions of years.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.680
 I have a feeling we're talking about, you know,

28:46.680 --> 28:49.680
 maybe millions of nanoseconds or picoseconds.

28:49.680 --> 28:53.680
 We're talking about chemistry, which is happening quickly.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.680
 But we still need to constrain those steps,

28:56.680 --> 29:00.680
 but we've got a planet doing similar chemistry.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.680
 You asked about a trajectory.

29:02.680 --> 29:04.680
 The trajectory is the planetary trajectory.

29:04.680 --> 29:06.680
 The planet has properties.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.680
 It's basically, it's got a lot of iron at the center of it.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.680
 It's got a lot of electrons at the center of it.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.680
 It's more oxidized on the outside partly because of the sun.

29:12.680 --> 29:16.680
 And partly because the heat of volcanoes puts out oxidized gases.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.680
 So the planet is a battery.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.680
 It's a giant battery.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.680
 And we have a flow of electrons going from inside to outside

29:23.680 --> 29:25.680
 in these hydrothermal vents.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.680
 And that's the same topology that a cell has.

29:28.680 --> 29:33.680
 A cell is basically just a micro version of the planet.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.680
 And it's, there is a trajectory in all of that.

29:36.680 --> 29:39.680
 And there's an inevitability that certain types of chemical reaction

29:39.680 --> 29:41.680
 are going to be favored over others.

29:41.680 --> 29:45.680
 And there's an inevitability in what happens in water,

29:45.680 --> 29:47.680
 the chemistry that happens in water.

29:47.680 --> 29:51.680
 Some will be immiscible with water and will form membranes

29:51.680 --> 29:53.680
 and will form insoluble structures.

29:53.680 --> 29:57.680
 And you know, water is a, nobody really understands water very well.

29:57.680 --> 30:01.680
 And it's another big question for pre experiments on the origin of life.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.680
 What do you put it in?

30:03.680 --> 30:06.680
 What kind of structure do we want to induce in this water?

30:06.680 --> 30:10.680
 Because the last thing is likely to be is just kind of bulk water.

30:10.680 --> 30:13.680
 How fundamental is water to life, would you say?

30:13.680 --> 30:16.680
 I would say pretty fundamental.

30:16.680 --> 30:21.680
 I wouldn't like to say it's impossible for life to start any other way.

30:21.680 --> 30:24.680
 But water is everywhere.

30:24.680 --> 30:27.680
 Water is extremely good at what it does.

30:27.680 --> 30:30.680
 And carbon, carbon works in water especially well.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.680
 So those things and carbon is everywhere.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.680
 So those things together make me think probabilistically,

30:35.680 --> 30:37.680
 if we found a thousand life forms,

30:37.680 --> 30:41.680
 995 of them would be carbon based and living in water.

30:41.680 --> 30:45.680
 Now the reverse question, if you found a puddle of water elsewhere

30:45.680 --> 30:49.680
 and some carbon, no, just a puddle of water.

30:49.680 --> 30:54.680
 Is a puddle of water a pretty damn good indication that life has,

30:54.680 --> 31:00.680
 either exists here or has once existed here?

31:00.680 --> 31:01.680
 No.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.680
 So it doesn't work the other way.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.680
 I think you need a living planet.

31:06.680 --> 31:10.680
 You need a planet which is capable of turning over its surface.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.680
 It needs to be a planet with water.

31:12.680 --> 31:17.680
 It needs to be capable of bringing those electrons from inside to the outside.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.680
 It needs to turn over its surface.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.680
 It needs to make that water work and turn it into hydrogen.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.680
 So I think you need a living planet.

31:24.680 --> 31:25.680
 But once you've got the living planet,

31:25.680 --> 31:29.680
 I think the rest of it is kind of thermodynamics all the way.

31:29.680 --> 31:35.680
 So if you were to run Earth over a million times up to this point,

31:35.680 --> 31:37.680
 maybe beyond to the end.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.680
 Let's run it to the end.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.680
 What is it, how much variety is there?

31:42.680 --> 31:47.680
 You kind of spoke to this trajectory that the environment dictates

31:47.680 --> 31:51.680
 like chemically, I don't know in which other way,

31:51.680 --> 31:59.680
 spiritually, like dictates kind of the direction of this giant machine

31:59.680 --> 32:04.680
 that seems chaotic, but it does seem to have order in the steps it's taking.

32:04.680 --> 32:10.680
 How often will life, how often will bacteria emerge?

32:10.680 --> 32:12.680
 How often will something like humans emerge?

32:12.680 --> 32:14.680
 How much variety do you think there would be?

32:14.680 --> 32:18.680
 I think at the level of bacteria, not much variety.

32:18.680 --> 32:23.680
 I think we would get, that's how many times you say you want to run it a million times.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.680
 I would say at least a few hundred thousand will get bacteria again.

32:27.680 --> 32:28.680
 Oh, wow.

32:28.680 --> 32:36.680
 Because I think there's some level of inevitability that a wet rocky planet will give rise through the same processes

32:36.680 --> 32:40.680
 to something very, I think this is not something I'd have thought a few years ago,

32:40.680 --> 32:43.680
 but we're working with a PhD student of mine, Stuart Harrison.

32:43.680 --> 32:48.680
 He's been thinking about the genetic code and we've just been publishing on that.

32:48.680 --> 32:52.680
 There are patterns that you can discern in the code, or he has discerned in the code,

32:52.680 --> 32:59.680
 that if you think about them in terms of we start with CO2 and hydrogen and these are the first steps of biochemistry,

32:59.680 --> 33:02.680
 you come up with a code which is very similar to the code that we see.

33:02.680 --> 33:07.680
 So it wouldn't surprise me any longer if we found life on Mars and it had a genetic code

33:07.680 --> 33:10.680
 that was not very different to the genetic code that we have here,

33:10.680 --> 33:13.680
 without it just being transferred across.

33:13.680 --> 33:17.680
 There's some inevitability about the whole of the beginnings of life in my view.

33:17.680 --> 33:25.680
 That's really promising because if the basic chemistry is tightly linked to the genetic code,

33:25.680 --> 33:29.680
 that means we can interact with other life if it exists out there.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.680
 Well, that's potentially...

33:31.680 --> 33:34.680
 That's really exciting if that's the case.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.680
 But then bacteria...

33:35.680 --> 33:37.680
 We've got bacteria.

33:37.680 --> 33:41.680
 How easy is photosynthesis?

33:41.680 --> 33:44.680
 Much harder, I would say.

33:44.680 --> 33:45.680
 Let's actually go there.

33:45.680 --> 33:48.680
 Let's go through the inventions.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.680
 What is photosynthesis and why is it hard?

33:51.680 --> 33:54.680
 Well, there are different forms.

33:54.680 --> 33:59.680
 Basically, you're taking hydrogen and you're sticking it onto CO2 and it's powered by the sun.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.680
 The question is where are you taking the hydrogen from?

34:02.680 --> 34:06.680
 And in photosynthesis that we know in plants, it's coming from water.

34:06.680 --> 34:10.680
 So you're using the power of the sun to split water, take out the hydrogen, stick it onto CO2

34:10.680 --> 34:14.680
 and the oxygen is a waste product and you just throw it out, throw it away.

34:14.680 --> 34:20.680
 So it's the single greatest planetary pollution event in the whole history of the Earth.

34:20.680 --> 34:22.680
 The pollutant being oxygen.

34:22.680 --> 34:23.680
 Yes.

34:23.680 --> 34:25.680
 It also made possible animals.

34:25.680 --> 34:29.680
 You can't have large active animals without an oxygenated atmosphere,

34:29.680 --> 34:32.680
 at least not in the sense that we know on Earth.

34:32.680 --> 34:35.680
 So that's a really big invention in the history of Earth.

34:35.680 --> 34:36.680
 Huge invention, yes.

34:36.680 --> 34:37.680
 And it happened once.

34:37.680 --> 34:41.680
 There's a few things that happen once on Earth and you're always stuck with this problem.

34:41.680 --> 34:47.680
 Once it happened, did it become so good so quickly that it precluded the same thing happening ever again?

34:47.680 --> 34:49.680
 Or are there other reasons?

34:49.680 --> 34:53.680
 And we really have to look at each one in turn and think, why did it only happen once?

34:53.680 --> 34:57.680
 In this case, it's really difficult to split water.

34:57.680 --> 35:02.680
 It requires a lot of power and that power, you're effectively separating charge across a membrane

35:02.680 --> 35:07.680
 and the way in which you do it, if it doesn't all rush back and kind of cause an explosion right at the site,

35:07.680 --> 35:10.680
 requires really careful wiring.

35:10.680 --> 35:18.680
 And that wiring, it can't be easy to get it right because the plants that we see around us,

35:18.680 --> 35:19.680
 they have chloroplasts.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.680
 Those chloroplasts were cyanobacteria ones.

35:21.680 --> 35:25.680
 Those cyanobacteria are the only group of bacteria that can do that type of photosynthesis.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.680
 So there's plenty of opportunity.

35:27.680 --> 35:29.680
 So not even many bacteria.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.680
 So who invented photosynthesis?

35:31.680 --> 35:33.680
 The cyanobacteria or their ancestors.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.680
 And there's not many...

35:35.680 --> 35:39.680
 No other bacteria can do what's called oxygenic photosynthesis.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.680
 Lots of other bacteria can split.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.680
 I mean, you can take your hydrogen from somewhere else.

35:43.680 --> 35:46.680
 You can take it from hydrogen sulfide bubbling out of a hydrothermal vent.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.680
 Grab your two hydrogens.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.680
 The sulfur is the waste now.

35:51.680 --> 35:52.680
 You can do it from iron.

35:52.680 --> 35:53.680
 You can take electrons.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.680
 So the early oceans were probably full of iron.

35:55.680 --> 35:58.680
 You can take an electron from ferrous iron.

35:58.680 --> 36:03.680
 So iron two plus and make it iron three plus, which now precipitates as rust.

36:03.680 --> 36:07.680
 And you take a proton from the acidic early ocean, stick it there.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.680
 Now you've got a hydrogen atom, stick it onto CO2.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.680
 You've just done the trick.

36:11.680 --> 36:15.680
 The trouble is you bury yourself in rusty iron.

36:15.680 --> 36:17.680
 And with sulfur, you can bury yourself in sulfur.

36:17.680 --> 36:25.680
 One of the reasons oxygenic photosynthesis is so much better is that the waste product is oxygen, which just bubbles away.

36:25.680 --> 36:28.680
 That seems like extremely unlikely.

36:28.680 --> 36:35.680
 And it's extremely essential for the evolution of complex organisms because of all the oxygen.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.680
 Yeah. And that didn't accumulate quickly either.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.680
 So it's converting, what is it?

36:41.680 --> 36:49.680
 It's converting energy from the sun and the resource of water into the resource needed for animals.

36:49.680 --> 36:51.680
 Both resources needed for animals.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.680
 We need to eat and we need to burn the food.

36:53.680 --> 36:58.680
 And we're eating plants, which are getting their energy from the sun.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.680
 And we're burning it with their waste product, which is the oxygen.

37:01.680 --> 37:11.680
 So there's a lot of kind of circularity in that, but without an oxygenated planet, you couldn't really have predation.

37:11.680 --> 37:16.680
 You can have animals, but you can't really have animals that go around and eat each other.

37:16.680 --> 37:19.680
 You can't have ecosystems as we know them.

37:19.680 --> 37:20.680
 Well, let's actually step back.

37:20.680 --> 37:25.680
 What about your periodic versus prokaryotic cells, prokaryotes?

37:25.680 --> 37:30.680
 What are each of those and how big of an invention is that?

37:30.680 --> 37:34.680
 I personally think that's the single biggest invention in the whole history of life.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.680
 Exciting. So what are they? Can you explain?

37:37.680 --> 37:42.680
 Yeah. So I mentioned bacteria and archaea. These are both prokaryotes.

37:42.680 --> 37:45.680
 They're basically small cells that don't have a nucleus.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.680
 If you look at them under a microscope, you don't see much going on.

37:47.680 --> 37:52.680
 If you look at them under a super resolution microscope, then they're fantastically complex.

37:52.680 --> 37:55.680
 In terms of their molecular machinery, they're amazing.

37:55.680 --> 38:02.680
 In terms of their morphological appearance under a microscope, they're really small and really simple.

38:02.680 --> 38:06.680
 The earliest life that we can physically see on the planet are stromatolites,

38:06.680 --> 38:10.680
 which are made by things like cyanobacteria and their large superstructures.

38:10.680 --> 38:19.680
 Effectively, biofilms plated on top of each other and you end up with quite large structures that you can see in the fossil record.

38:19.680 --> 38:24.680
 But they never came up with animals. They never came up with plants.

38:24.680 --> 38:28.680
 They came up with multicellular things, filamentous cyanobacteria, for example.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.680
 They're just long strings of cells.

38:31.680 --> 38:37.680
 But the origin of the eukaryotic cell seems to have been what's called an endosymbiosis.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.680
 So one cell gets inside another cell.

38:39.680 --> 38:43.680
 And I think that that's transformed the energetic possibilities of life.

38:43.680 --> 38:47.680
 So what we end up with is a kind of supercharged cell,

38:47.680 --> 38:53.680
 which can have a much larger nucleus with many more genes, all supported.

38:53.680 --> 38:57.680
 If you think about it, you could think about it as multi bacterial power without the overhead.

38:57.680 --> 39:00.680
 So you've got a cell and it's got bacteria living in it.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.680
 And those bacteria are providing it with the energy currency it needs.

39:03.680 --> 39:09.680
 But each bacterium has a genome of its own, which costs a fair amount of energy to express,

39:09.680 --> 39:14.680
 to kind of turn over and convert into proteins and so on.

39:14.680 --> 39:19.680
 What the mitochondria did, which are these power packs in our own cells,

39:19.680 --> 39:23.680
 they were bacteria once and they threw away virtually all their genes.

39:23.680 --> 39:25.680
 They've only got a few left.

39:25.680 --> 39:29.680
 So mitochondria is, like you said, is the bacteria that got inside a cell.

39:29.680 --> 39:34.680
 And then throw away all this stuff it doesn't need to survive inside the cell and then kept what?

39:34.680 --> 39:40.680
 So what we end up with, so it kept always a handful of genes in our own case, 37 genes.

39:40.680 --> 39:46.680
 But there's a few protists which are single cells, things that have got as many as 70 or 80 genes.

39:46.680 --> 39:50.680
 So it's not always the same, but it's always a small number.

39:50.680 --> 39:58.680
 And you can think of it as a paired down power pack where the control unit has really been kind of paired down to almost nothing.

39:58.680 --> 40:03.680
 So you're putting out the same power, but the investment in the overheads is really paired down.

40:03.680 --> 40:07.680
 That means that you can support a much larger nuclear genome.

40:07.680 --> 40:14.680
 So we've gone up in the number of genes, but also the amount of power you have to convert those genes into proteins.

40:14.680 --> 40:22.680
 We've gone up about fourfold in the number of genes, but in terms of the size of genomes and your ability to make the building blocks, make the proteins,

40:22.680 --> 40:24.680
 we've gone up 100,000 fold or more.

40:24.680 --> 40:29.680
 So it's huge step change in the possibilities of evolution.

40:29.680 --> 40:37.680
 And it's interesting then that the only two occasions that complex life has arisen on Earth, plants and animals,

40:37.680 --> 40:43.680
 fungi you could say are complex as well, but they don't form such complex morphology as plants and animals.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.680
 Start with a single cell.

40:45.680 --> 40:49.680
 They start with an oocyte and a sperm fused together to make as I got.

40:49.680 --> 40:55.680
 So we start development with a single cell and all the cells in the organism have identical DNA.

40:55.680 --> 41:02.680
 And you switch off in the brain, you switch off these genes and you switch on those genes and the liver, you switch off those and you switch on a different set.

41:02.680 --> 41:07.680
 And the standard evolutionary explanation for that is that you're restricting conflict.

41:07.680 --> 41:13.680
 You don't have a load of genetically different cells that are all fighting each other.

41:13.680 --> 41:14.680
 And so it works.

41:14.680 --> 41:22.680
 The trouble with bacteria, they form these biofilms and they're all genetically different and effectively they're incapable of that level of cooperation.

41:22.680 --> 41:25.680
 They would get in a fight.

41:25.680 --> 41:37.680
 Okay, so why is this such a difficult invention of getting this bacteria inside and becoming an engine, which the mitochondria is?

41:37.680 --> 41:40.680
 Why do you assign it such great importance?

41:40.680 --> 41:46.680
 Is it great importance in terms of the difficulty of how it was to achieve or great importance in terms of the impact it had on life?

41:46.680 --> 41:47.680
 Both.

41:47.680 --> 41:55.680
 It had a huge impact on life because if that had not happened, you can be certain that life on earth would be bacterial only.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.680
 And that took a really long time to...

41:57.680 --> 42:02.680
 It took two billion years and it hasn't happened since to the best of our knowledge.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.680
 So it looks as if it's genuinely difficult.

42:04.680 --> 42:14.680
 And if you think about it then from just an informational perspective, you think bacteria have got, they structure their information differently.

42:14.680 --> 42:17.680
 So a bacterial cell has a small genome.

42:17.680 --> 42:23.680
 You might have 4,000 genes in it, but a single E. coli cell has access to about 30,000 genes potentially.

42:23.680 --> 42:31.680
 It's got a kind of metagenome where other E. coli out there have got different gene sets and they can switch them around between themselves.

42:31.680 --> 42:35.680
 And so you can generate a huge amount of variation and they've got more...

42:35.680 --> 42:40.680
 An E. coli metagenome is larger than the human genome.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.680
 We have 20,000 genes or something.

42:42.680 --> 42:50.680
 And they've had 4 billion years of evolution to work out what can I do and what can't I do with this metagenome.

42:50.680 --> 42:53.680
 And the answer is you're stuck, you're still bacteria.

42:53.680 --> 43:05.680
 So they have explored genetic sequence space far more thoroughly than eukaryotes ever did because they've had twice as long at least and they've got much larger populations.

43:05.680 --> 43:07.680
 And they never got around this problem.

43:07.680 --> 43:08.680
 So why can't they?

43:08.680 --> 43:12.680
 It seems as if you can't solve it with information alone.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.680
 So what's the problem?

43:14.680 --> 43:16.680
 The problem is structure.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.680
 If cells...

43:18.680 --> 43:22.680
 If the very first cells needed an electrical charge on their membrane to grow.

43:22.680 --> 43:27.680
 And in bacteria, it's the outer membrane that surrounds the cell, which is electrically charged.

43:27.680 --> 43:31.680
 You try and scale that up and you've got a fundamental design problem.

43:31.680 --> 43:33.680
 You've got an engineering problem.

43:33.680 --> 43:38.680
 And there are examples of it and what we see in all these cases is what's known as extreme polyploidy,

43:38.680 --> 43:42.680
 which is to say they have tens of thousands of copies of their complete genome,

43:42.680 --> 43:51.680
 which is energetically hugely expensive and you end up with a large bacteria with no further development.

43:51.680 --> 44:01.680
 What you need is to incorporate these electrically charged power pack units inside with their control units intact.

44:01.680 --> 44:05.680
 And for them not to conflict so much with the host cell that it all goes wrong.

44:05.680 --> 44:07.680
 Perhaps it goes wrong more often than not.

44:07.680 --> 44:10.680
 And then you change the topology of the cell.

44:10.680 --> 44:16.680
 Now, you don't necessarily have any more DNA than a giant bacterium with extreme polyploidy.

44:16.680 --> 44:18.680
 But what you've got is an asymmetry.

44:18.680 --> 44:26.680
 You now have a giant nuclear genome surrounded by lots of subsidiary energetic genomes that do all the...

44:26.680 --> 44:31.680
 They're the control units that are doing all the control of energy generation.

44:31.680 --> 44:35.680
 Could this have been done gradually or does it have to be done?

44:35.680 --> 44:39.680
 The power pack has to be all intact and ready to go and work.

44:39.680 --> 44:44.680
 I mean, it's a kind of step change in the possibilities of evolution, but it doesn't happen overnight.

44:44.680 --> 44:47.680
 It's going to still require multiple, multiple generations.

44:47.680 --> 44:50.680
 So it could take millions of years.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.680
 It could take shorted times.

44:52.680 --> 44:56.680
 I would like to put the number of steps and try and work out what's required at each step.

44:56.680 --> 44:58.680
 We are trying to do that with sex.

44:58.680 --> 45:02.680
 You can't have a very large genome unless you have sex at that point.

45:02.680 --> 45:07.680
 So what are the changes to go from bacterial recombination to eukaryotic recombination?

45:07.680 --> 45:09.680
 What do you need to do?

45:09.680 --> 45:15.680
 Why do we go from passing around bits of DNA as if it's loose change to fusing cells together,

45:15.680 --> 45:18.680
 lining up the chromosomes, recombining across the chromosomes,

45:18.680 --> 45:21.680
 and then going through two rounds of cell division to produce your gametes?

45:21.680 --> 45:23.680
 All eukaryotes do it that way.

45:23.680 --> 45:26.680
 So again, why switch?

45:26.680 --> 45:28.680
 What are the drivers here?

45:28.680 --> 45:29.680
 So there's a lot of time.

45:29.680 --> 45:33.680
 There's a lot of evolution, but as soon as you've got cells living inside another cell,

45:33.680 --> 45:35.680
 what you've got is a new design.

45:35.680 --> 45:38.680
 You've got new potential that you didn't have before.

45:38.680 --> 45:47.680
 So the cell living inside another cell, that design allows for better storage of information,

45:47.680 --> 45:54.680
 better use of energy, more delegation, like a hierarchical control of the whole thing.

45:54.680 --> 45:59.680
 And then somehow that leads to ability to have multi cell organisms.

45:59.680 --> 46:02.680
 I'm not sure that you have hierarchical control necessarily,

46:02.680 --> 46:09.680
 but you've got a system where you can have a much larger information storage depot in the nucleus.

46:09.680 --> 46:11.680
 You can have a much larger genome.

46:11.680 --> 46:17.680
 And that allows multi cellularity, yes, because it allows you...

46:17.680 --> 46:25.680
 It's a funny thing, but to have an animal where I have 70% of my genes switched on in my brain

46:25.680 --> 46:28.680
 and a different 50% switched on in my liver or something,

46:28.680 --> 46:31.680
 you've got to have all those genes in the egg cell at the very beginning,

46:31.680 --> 46:35.680
 and you've got to have a program of development which says,

46:35.680 --> 46:38.680
 okay, you guys switch off those genes and switch on those genes,

46:38.680 --> 46:40.680
 and you guys, you do that.

46:40.680 --> 46:42.680
 All the genes are there at the beginning.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.680
 That means you've got to have a lot of genes in one cell,

46:44.680 --> 46:46.680
 and you've got to be able to maintain them.

46:46.680 --> 46:49.680
 And the problem with bacteria is they don't get close to having enough genes in one cell.

46:49.680 --> 46:53.680
 So if you were to try and make a multi cellular organism from bacteria,

46:53.680 --> 46:56.680
 you'd bring different types of bacteria together and hope they'll cooperate,

46:56.680 --> 46:58.680
 and the reality is they don't.

46:58.680 --> 47:00.680
 That's really, really tough to do, coming into it.

47:00.680 --> 47:02.680
 We know they don't because it doesn't exist.

47:02.680 --> 47:04.680
 We have the data, as far as we know.

47:04.680 --> 47:07.680
 I'm sure there's a few special ones, and they did off quickly.

47:07.680 --> 47:11.680
 I'd love to know some of the most fun things bacteria have done since.

47:11.680 --> 47:15.680
 I mean, they can do some pretty funky things.

47:15.680 --> 47:18.680
 This is broad brush joke that I'm talking about.

47:18.680 --> 47:20.680
 Yes, generally speaking.

47:20.680 --> 47:24.680
 So how was another fun invention?

47:24.680 --> 47:27.680
 Us humans seem to utilize it well,

47:27.680 --> 47:31.680
 but you say it's also very important early on is sex.

47:31.680 --> 47:34.680
 So what is sex?

47:34.680 --> 47:36.680
 Just asking for a friend.

47:36.680 --> 47:39.680
 When was it invented, and how hard was it to invent?

47:39.680 --> 47:42.680
 Just as you were saying, and why was it invented?

47:42.680 --> 47:45.680
 Why, how hard was it, and when?

47:45.680 --> 47:47.680
 I have a PhD student who's been working on this,

47:47.680 --> 47:49.680
 and we've just published a couple of papers on sex.

47:49.680 --> 47:50.680
 Yes, yes, yes.

47:50.680 --> 47:51.680
 What do you publish?

47:51.680 --> 47:54.680
 Does biology, is it biology, genetics, journals?

47:54.680 --> 47:59.680
 This is actually PNAS, which is Proceedings of the National Academy.

47:59.680 --> 48:01.680
 It's a broad, big picture stuff.

48:01.680 --> 48:03.680
 Everyone's interested in sex.

48:03.680 --> 48:07.680
 The job of biologist is to make sex dull.

48:07.680 --> 48:10.680
 Yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it.

48:10.680 --> 48:12.680
 Okay, so when was it invented?

48:12.680 --> 48:16.680
 It was invented with eukaryotes about two billion years ago.

48:16.680 --> 48:20.680
 All eukaryotes share the same basic mechanism

48:20.680 --> 48:21.680
 that you produce gametes.

48:21.680 --> 48:25.680
 The gametes fuse together, so a gamete is the egg cell and the sperm.

48:25.680 --> 48:28.680
 They're not necessarily even different in size or shape.

48:28.680 --> 48:32.680
 So the simplest eukaryotes produce what are called motile gametes.

48:32.680 --> 48:34.680
 They're all like sperm and they all swim around.

48:34.680 --> 48:35.680
 They find each other.

48:35.680 --> 48:36.680
 They fuse together.

48:36.680 --> 48:39.680
 They don't have much going on there beyond that.

48:39.680 --> 48:42.680
 And then these are haploid,

48:42.680 --> 48:45.680
 which is to say we all have two copies of our genome,

48:45.680 --> 48:48.680
 and the gametes have only a single copy of the genome.

48:48.680 --> 48:51.680
 So when they fuse together, you now become diploid again,

48:51.680 --> 48:54.680
 which is to say you now have two copies of your genome.

48:54.680 --> 48:58.680
 And what you do is you line them all up,

48:58.680 --> 49:01.680
 and then you double everything.

49:01.680 --> 49:03.680
 So now we have four copies of the complete genome,

49:03.680 --> 49:05.680
 and then we crisscross between all of these things.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.680
 So we take a bit from here and stick it on there,

49:07.680 --> 49:09.680
 and a bit from here, and we stick it on here.

49:09.680 --> 49:11.680
 That's recombination.

49:11.680 --> 49:14.680
 And then we go through two rounds of cell division.

49:14.680 --> 49:15.680
 So we divide in half.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.680
 So now the two daughter cells have two copies,

49:17.680 --> 49:19.680
 and we divide in half again.

49:19.680 --> 49:23.680
 Now we have some gametes, each of which has got a single copy of the genome.

49:23.680 --> 49:29.680
 And that's the basic ground plan for what's called meiosis and syngamine.

49:29.680 --> 49:30.680
 That's basically sex.

49:30.680 --> 49:33.680
 And it happens at the level of single celled organisms,

49:33.680 --> 49:35.680
 and it happens pretty much the same way in plants

49:35.680 --> 49:37.680
 and pretty much the same way in animals and so on.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.680
 And it's not found in any bacteria.

49:39.680 --> 49:42.680
 They switch things around using the same machinery,

49:42.680 --> 49:44.680
 and they take up a bit of DNA from the environment.

49:44.680 --> 49:46.680
 They take out this bit and stick in that bit,

49:46.680 --> 49:49.680
 and it's the same molecular machinery they're using to do it.

49:49.680 --> 49:52.680
 So what about the kind of, you said, find each other,

49:52.680 --> 49:55.680
 this kind of imperative to find each other?

49:55.680 --> 49:57.680
 What is that?

49:57.680 --> 49:59.680
 Well, you've got a few cells together.

49:59.680 --> 50:03.680
 So the bottom line on all of this is bacteria.

50:03.680 --> 50:07.680
 I mean, it's kind of simple when you've figured it out,

50:07.680 --> 50:08.680
 and figuring it out, this is not me,

50:08.680 --> 50:11.680
 this is my PhD student, Marco Colnaghi.

50:11.680 --> 50:17.680
 And in effect, if you're doing lateral, you're an E. coli cell.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.680
 You've got 4,000 genes.

50:19.680 --> 50:21.680
 You want to scale up to a eukaryotic size.

50:21.680 --> 50:24.680
 I want to have 20,000 genes.

50:24.680 --> 50:27.680
 And I need to maintain my genome,

50:27.680 --> 50:30.680
 so it doesn't get shot pieces by mutations.

50:30.680 --> 50:32.680
 And I'm going to do it by lateral gene transfer.

50:32.680 --> 50:35.680
 So I know I've got a mutation in a gene.

50:35.680 --> 50:38.680
 I don't know which gene it is, because I'm not sentient,

50:38.680 --> 50:40.680
 but I know I can't grow.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.680
 I know all my regulation systems are saying,

50:42.680 --> 50:43.680
 something wrong here, something wrong.

50:43.680 --> 50:44.680
 Pick up some DNA.

50:44.680 --> 50:47.680
 Pick up a bit of DNA from the environment.

50:47.680 --> 50:48.680
 If you've got a small genome,

50:48.680 --> 50:50.680
 the chances of you picking up the right bit of DNA

50:50.680 --> 50:52.680
 from the environment is much higher

50:52.680 --> 50:54.680
 than if you've got a genome of 20,000 genes.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.680
 To do that, you've effectively got to be picking up DNA

50:57.680 --> 51:00.680
 all the time, all day long, and nothing else.

51:00.680 --> 51:02.680
 And you're still going to get the wrong DNA.

51:02.680 --> 51:03.680
 You've got to pick up large chunks.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.680
 And in the end, you've got to align them.

51:05.680 --> 51:09.680
 You're forced into sex, to coin a phrase.

51:09.680 --> 51:12.680
 So you're...

51:12.680 --> 51:18.680
 So there is a kind of incentive.

51:18.680 --> 51:20.680
 If you want to have a large genome,

51:20.680 --> 51:22.680
 you've got to prevent it mutating to nothing.

51:22.680 --> 51:23.680
 That will happen with bacteria.

51:23.680 --> 51:26.680
 There's another reason why bacteria can't have a large genome.

51:26.680 --> 51:28.680
 But as soon as you give them the power pack,

51:28.680 --> 51:30.680
 as soon as you give your carers themselves the power pack

51:30.680 --> 51:32.680
 that allows them to increase the size of their genome,

51:32.680 --> 51:35.680
 then you face the pressure that you've got to maintain its quality.

51:35.680 --> 51:37.680
 You've got to stop it just mutating away.

51:37.680 --> 51:39.680
 What about sexual selection?

51:39.680 --> 51:42.680
 So the finding, like,

51:42.680 --> 51:44.680
 I don't like this one.

51:44.680 --> 51:45.680
 I don't like this one.

51:45.680 --> 51:46.680
 This one seems all right.

51:46.680 --> 51:49.680
 Like, what's the...

51:49.680 --> 51:52.680
 At which point does it become less random?

51:52.680 --> 51:53.680
 It's hard to know.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.680
 Because eukaryotes just kind of float around.

51:55.680 --> 51:56.680
 They just kind of have...

51:56.680 --> 51:57.680
 Yeah.

51:57.680 --> 51:59.680
 I mean, is there sexual selection in single celled eukaryotes?

51:59.680 --> 52:00.680
 There probably is.

52:00.680 --> 52:02.680
 It's just that I don't know very much about it.

52:02.680 --> 52:03.680
 By the time we...

52:03.680 --> 52:05.680
 You don't hang out with the eukaryotes.

52:05.680 --> 52:07.680
 Well, I do all the time, but I...

52:07.680 --> 52:08.680
 But you can't communicate with them yet.

52:08.680 --> 52:09.680
 Yeah.

52:09.680 --> 52:10.680
 A peacock or something.

52:10.680 --> 52:12.680
 Yes.

52:12.680 --> 52:13.680
 The kind of standard...

52:13.680 --> 52:16.680
 This is not quite what I work on, but the standard answer

52:16.680 --> 52:19.680
 is that it's female mate choice.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.680
 She is looking for good genes.

52:21.680 --> 52:25.680
 And if you can have a tail that's like this

52:25.680 --> 52:27.680
 and still survive, still be alive,

52:27.680 --> 52:29.680
 not actually have been taken down by the nearest predator,

52:29.680 --> 52:31.680
 then you must have got pretty good genes.

52:31.680 --> 52:35.680
 Because despite this handicap, you're able to survive.

52:35.680 --> 52:36.680
 So...

52:36.680 --> 52:37.680
 So those are like human interpretable things,

52:37.680 --> 52:38.680
 like with a peacock.

52:38.680 --> 52:42.680
 But I wonder, I'm sure echos of the same thing

52:42.680 --> 52:45.680
 are there with more primitive organisms.

52:45.680 --> 52:47.680
 Basically, your PR.

52:47.680 --> 52:48.680
 Yes.

52:48.680 --> 52:53.680
 It's like how you advertise yourself that you're worthy of...

52:53.680 --> 52:54.680
 Absolutely.

52:54.680 --> 52:57.680
 So one big advertisement is the fact that you survived it all.

52:57.680 --> 53:02.680
 Let me give you one beautiful example of an algal bloom.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.680
 And this can be a cyanobacteria.

53:05.680 --> 53:07.680
 It's going to be in bacteria.

53:07.680 --> 53:10.680
 So if suddenly you pump nitrate or phosphate

53:10.680 --> 53:13.680
 or something into the ocean and everything goes green,

53:13.680 --> 53:17.680
 you end up with all this algae growing there.

53:17.680 --> 53:20.680
 A viral infection or something like that

53:20.680 --> 53:22.680
 can kill the entire bloom overnight.

53:22.680 --> 53:26.680
 And it's not that the virus takes out everything overnight.

53:26.680 --> 53:28.680
 It's that most of the cells in that bloom

53:28.680 --> 53:31.680
 kill themselves before the virus can get onto them.

53:31.680 --> 53:34.680
 And it's still a form of cell death called programmed cell death.

53:34.680 --> 53:36.680
 And we do the same thing.

53:36.680 --> 53:39.680
 This is how we have the gaps between our fingers and so on.

53:39.680 --> 53:42.680
 It's how we craft synapses in the brain.

53:42.680 --> 53:46.680
 It's fundamental again to multicellular life.

53:46.680 --> 53:50.680
 They have the same machinery in these algal blooms.

53:50.680 --> 53:52.680
 How do they know who dies?

53:52.680 --> 53:55.680
 The answer is they will often put out a toxin.

53:55.680 --> 53:59.680
 And that toxin is kind of a challenge to you.

53:59.680 --> 54:02.680
 Either you can cope with the toxin or you can't.

54:02.680 --> 54:05.680
 If you can cope with it, you form a spore

54:05.680 --> 54:08.680
 and you will go on to become the next generation.

54:08.680 --> 54:11.680
 You form a kind of a resistant spore.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.680
 You sink down a little bit, you get out of the way,

54:13.680 --> 54:17.680
 you can't be attacked by a virus if you're a spore,

54:17.680 --> 54:19.680
 or at least not so easily.

54:19.680 --> 54:21.680
 Whereas if you can't deal with that toxin,

54:21.680 --> 54:25.680
 you pull the plug and you trigger your death apparatus

54:25.680 --> 54:27.680
 and you kill yourself.

54:27.680 --> 54:29.680
 It's truly life and death.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.680
 So it's a challenge.

54:31.680 --> 54:33.680
 And this is a bit like sexual selection.

54:33.680 --> 54:36.680
 They're all pretty much genetically identical.

54:36.680 --> 54:38.680
 But they've had different life histories.

54:38.680 --> 54:41.680
 So have you had a tough day?

54:41.680 --> 54:44.680
 Did you happen to get infected by this virus?

54:44.680 --> 54:45.680
 Or did you run out of iron?

54:45.680 --> 54:47.680
 Or did you get a bit too much sun?

54:47.680 --> 54:48.680
 Whatever it may be.

54:48.680 --> 54:52.680
 If this extra stress of the toxin just pushes you over the edge,

54:52.680 --> 54:53.680
 then you have this binary choice.

54:53.680 --> 54:54.680
 Either you're the next generation

54:54.680 --> 54:57.680
 or you kill yourself now using the same machinery.

54:57.680 --> 55:00.680
 It's also actually exactly the way I approach dating.

55:00.680 --> 55:03.680
 But that's probably why I'm single.

55:03.680 --> 55:06.680
 What about if we can step back DNA?

55:06.680 --> 55:09.680
 Just mechanism of storing information.

55:09.680 --> 55:11.680
 RNA, DNA.

55:11.680 --> 55:13.680
 How big of an invention was that?

55:13.680 --> 55:20.680
 That seems to be fundamental to something deep

55:20.680 --> 55:23.680
 within what life is, is the ability, as you said,

55:23.680 --> 55:27.680
 to kind of store and propagate information.

55:27.680 --> 55:30.680
 But then you also kind of infer that with your

55:30.680 --> 55:33.680
 and your students work that there's a deep connection

55:33.680 --> 55:36.680
 between the chemistry and the ability

55:36.680 --> 55:38.680
 to have this kind of genetic information.

55:38.680 --> 55:43.680
 So how big of an invention is it to have a nice representation,

55:43.680 --> 55:45.680
 a nice hard drive for info to pass on?

55:45.680 --> 55:47.680
 Huge, I suspect.

55:47.680 --> 55:50.680
 But when I was talking about the code,

55:50.680 --> 55:52.680
 you see the code in RNA as well.

55:52.680 --> 55:55.680
 And RNA almost certainly came first.

55:55.680 --> 55:59.680
 And there's been an idea going back decades called the RNA world

55:59.680 --> 56:02.680
 because RNA, in theory, can copy itself

56:02.680 --> 56:04.680
 and can catalyze reactions.

56:04.680 --> 56:07.680
 So it kind of cuts out this chicken and egg loop.

56:07.680 --> 56:09.680
 To DNA, it's possible it's not that special.

56:09.680 --> 56:13.680
 So RNA, RNA is the thing that does the work, really.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.680
 And the code lies in RNA.

56:15.680 --> 56:18.680
 The code lies in the interactions between RNA and amino acids.

56:18.680 --> 56:21.680
 And it still is there today in the ribosome, for example,

56:21.680 --> 56:23.680
 which is just kind of a giant ribosome,

56:23.680 --> 56:27.680
 which is to say it's an enzyme that's made of RNA.

56:27.680 --> 56:33.680
 So getting to RNA, I suspect, is probably not that hard.

56:33.680 --> 56:39.680
 But getting from RNA, there's multiple different types of RNA now.

56:39.680 --> 56:41.680
 How do you distinguish?

56:41.680 --> 56:43.680
 This is something we're actively thinking about.

56:43.680 --> 56:46.680
 How do you distinguish between a random population of RNA?

56:46.680 --> 56:49.680
 Some of them go on to become messenger RNA.

56:49.680 --> 56:53.680
 This is the transcript of the code, of the gene that you want to make.

56:53.680 --> 56:56.680
 Some of them become transfer RNA,

56:56.680 --> 56:59.680
 which is kind of the unit that holds the amino acid

56:59.680 --> 57:01.680
 that's going to be polymerized.

57:01.680 --> 57:04.680
 Some of them become ribosomal RNA,

57:04.680 --> 57:07.680
 which is the machine which is joining them all up together.

57:07.680 --> 57:10.680
 How do they discriminate themselves?

57:10.680 --> 57:13.680
 And there's some kind of phase transition going on there.

57:13.680 --> 57:16.680
 I don't know. It's a difficult question.

57:16.680 --> 57:19.680
 And we're now in the region of biology where information is coming in.

57:19.680 --> 57:22.680
 But the thing about RNA is very, very good at what it does.

57:22.680 --> 57:28.680
 But the largest genome supported by RNA are RNA viruses like HIV, for example.

57:28.680 --> 57:30.680
 They're pretty small.

57:30.680 --> 57:33.680
 And so there's a limit to how complex life could be

57:33.680 --> 57:38.680
 unless you come up with DNA, which chemically is a really small change.

57:38.680 --> 57:42.680
 But how easy it is to make that change, I don't really know.

57:42.680 --> 57:46.680
 As soon as you've got DNA, then you've got an amazingly stable molecule

57:46.680 --> 57:48.680
 for information storage.

57:48.680 --> 57:50.680
 And you can do absolutely anything.

57:50.680 --> 57:53.680
 But how likely that transition from RNA to DNA was?

57:53.680 --> 57:54.680
 I don't know either.

57:54.680 --> 57:59.680
 How much possibility is there for a variety in ways to store information?

57:59.680 --> 58:02.680
 Because there seems to be very specific characteristics

58:02.680 --> 58:05.680
 about the programming language of DNA.

58:05.680 --> 58:11.680
 Yeah, there's a lot of work going on on what's called ZenoDNA or RNA.

58:11.680 --> 58:17.680
 Can we replace the bases themselves, the letters, if you like, in RNA or DNA?

58:17.680 --> 58:19.680
 Can we replace the backbone?

58:19.680 --> 58:22.680
 Can we replace, for example, phosphate with arsenate?

58:22.680 --> 58:26.680
 Can we replace the sugar ribose or deoxyribose with a different sugar?

58:26.680 --> 58:29.680
 And the answer is yes, you can.

58:29.680 --> 58:33.680
 Within limits, there's not an infinite space there.

58:33.680 --> 58:37.680
 Arsenate doesn't really work if the bonds are not as strong as phosphate.

58:37.680 --> 58:41.680
 It's probably quite hard to replace phosphate.

58:41.680 --> 58:43.680
 It's possible to do it.

58:43.680 --> 58:47.680
 The question to me is, why is it this way?

58:47.680 --> 58:51.680
 Is it because there was some form of selection that this is better than the other forms?

58:51.680 --> 58:54.680
 And there were lots of competing forms of information storage early on,

58:54.680 --> 58:56.680
 and this one was the one that worked out.

58:56.680 --> 59:01.680
 Or was it kind of channeled that way, that these are the molecules that you're dealing with,

59:01.680 --> 59:03.680
 and they work?

59:03.680 --> 59:07.680
 And I'm increasingly thinking it's that way that we're channeled towards ribose,

59:07.680 --> 59:11.680
 phosphate, and the bases that are used.

59:11.680 --> 59:16.680
 But there are 200 different letters kicking around out there that could have been used.

59:16.680 --> 59:18.680
 It's such an interesting question.

59:18.680 --> 59:21.680
 If you look in the programming world in computer science,

59:21.680 --> 59:25.680
 there's a programming language called JavaScript, which was written super quickly.

59:25.680 --> 59:29.680
 It's a giant mess, but it took over the world.

59:29.680 --> 59:31.680
 Sounds very biological.

59:31.680 --> 59:37.680
 It was kind of a running joke that surely this can't be.

59:37.680 --> 59:39.680
 It's a terrible programming language.

59:39.680 --> 59:41.680
 It's a giant mess. It's full of bugs.

59:41.680 --> 59:43.680
 It's so easy to write really crappy code,

59:43.680 --> 59:48.680
 but it took over all of front end development in the web browser.

59:48.680 --> 59:54.680
 If you have any kind of dynamic interactive website, it's usually running JavaScript,

59:54.680 --> 59:57.680
 and it's now taking over much of the back end,

59:57.680 --> 1:00:00.680
 which is like the serious heavy duty computational stuff,

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:06.680
 and it's become super fast with the different compilation engines that are running it.

1:00:06.680 --> 1:00:08.680
 It really took over the world.

1:00:08.680 --> 1:00:14.680
 It's very possible that this initially crappy derided language actually takes everything over.

1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:21.680
 Then the question is, did human civilization always strive towards JavaScript,

1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:26.680
 or was JavaScript just the first programming language that ran on the browser and still sticky?

1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:32.680
 The first is the sticky one, and so it wins over anything else because it was first.

1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:36.680
 I don't think that's answerable, but it's good to ask that.

1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:44.680
 I suppose in the lab, you can't run it with programming languages, but in biology,

1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:54.680
 you can probably do some kind of small scale evolutionary test to try to infer which is which.

1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:58.680
 In a way, we've got the hardware and the software here,

1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:02.680
 and the hardware is maybe the DNA and the RNA itself,

1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:06.680
 and then the software perhaps is more about the code.

1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:08.680
 Did the code have to be this way? Could it have been a different way?

1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:13.680
 People talk about the optimization of the code, and there's some suggestion for that.

1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:15.680
 I think it's weak, actually.

1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:18.680
 But you could imagine you could come out with a million different codes,

1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:21.680
 and this would be one of the best ones.

1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:23.680
 Well, we don't know this.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:30.680
 People have tried to model it based on the effect that mutations would have.

1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:33.680
 No, you're right. We don't know it because that's a single assumption

1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:38.680
 that a mutation is what's being selected on there, and there's other possibilities, too.

1:01:38.680 --> 1:01:42.680
 There does seem to be a resilience and a redundancy to the whole thing.

1:01:42.680 --> 1:01:51.680
 It's hard to mess up, and the way you mess it up often is likely to produce interesting results.

1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:55.680
 Are you talking about JavaScript or the genetic code now?

1:01:55.680 --> 1:02:00.680
 Well, biology is underpinned by this kind of mess, as well.

1:02:00.680 --> 1:02:05.680
 You look at the human genome, and it's full of stuff that is really either broken or dysfunctional,

1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:08.680
 or was a virus once, whatever it may be, and somehow it works,

1:02:08.680 --> 1:02:10.680
 and maybe we need a lot of this mess.

1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:14.680
 We know that some functional genes are taken from this mess.

1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:18.680
 So what about, you mentioned the predatory behavior.

1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:19.680
 Yeah.

1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:24.680
 We talked about sex. What about violence, predator and prey dynamics?

1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:33.680
 When was that invented, and poetic and biological ways of putting it?

1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:37.680
 How do you describe a predator and prey relationship?

1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:42.680
 Is it a beautiful dance, or is it a violent atrocity?

1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:44.680
 Well, I guess it's both, isn't it?

1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:46.680
 I mean, when does it start? It starts in bacteria.

1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:49.680
 You see these amazing predators.

1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:54.680
 Well, the Vibrio is one that Lin Margulis used to talk about a lot.

1:02:54.680 --> 1:02:58.680
 It's got a kind of a drill piece that drills through the wall and the membrane of the bacterium,

1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:03.680
 and then it effectively eats the bacterium from just inside the periplasmic space,

1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:05.680
 and makes copies of itself that way.

1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:08.680
 So that's straight predation. There are predators among bacteria.

1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:17.680
 So predation in that, sorry to interrupt, means you murder somebody and use their body as a resource in some way.

1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:18.680
 Yeah.

1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:23.680
 Is it not parasitic in that you need them to be still alive?

1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:26.680
 No, no. I mean, predation is you kill them, really.

1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:27.680
 You murder.

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:30.680
 Parasites, so you kind of live on them.

1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:35.680
 Okay. But it seems the predator is the really popular tool.

1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:44.680
 So what we see if we go back 560, 570 million years before the Cambrian explosion,

1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:51.680
 is what's known as the Ediacaran fauna, or sometimes they call Vendobionts, which is a lovely name.

1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:55.680
 And it's not obvious that they're animals at all.

1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:56.680
 They're stalked things.

1:03:56.680 --> 1:04:02.680
 They often have fronds that look a lot like leaves with kind of fractal branching patterns on them.

1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:11.680
 And the thing is, they're found sometimes geologists can figure out the environment that they were in

1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:15.680
 and say, this is more than 200 meters deep because there's no sign of any waves.

1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:19.680
 There's no storm damage down here, this kind of thing.

1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:22.680
 They were more than 200 meters deep, so they're definitely not photosynthetic.

1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:24.680
 These are animals.

1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:26.680
 And they're filter feeders.

1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:29.680
 And we know sponges and corals and things are filter feeding animals.

1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:31.680
 They're stuck to the spot.

1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:37.680
 And little bits of carbon that come their way, they filter it out and that's what they're eating.

1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:41.680
 So no predation involved in this, beyond stuff just dies anyway.

1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:46.680
 And it feels like a very gentle, rather beautiful, rather limited world, you might say.

1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:49.680
 There's not a lot going on there.

1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:52.680
 And something changes.

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:54.680
 Oxygen definitely changes during this period.

1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:56.680
 Other things may have changed as well.

1:04:56.680 --> 1:05:00.680
 But the next thing you really see in the fossil record is the Cambrian explosion.

1:05:00.680 --> 1:05:02.680
 And what do we see there?

1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:05.680
 We're now seeing animals that we would recognize.

1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:08.680
 They've got eyes, they've got claws, they've got shells.

1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:14.680
 They're plainly killing things or running away and hiding.

1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:24.680
 And so we've gone from a rather gentle but limited world to a rather vicious, unpleasant world that we recognize.

1:05:24.680 --> 1:05:30.680
 And which leads to kind of arms races, evolutionary arms races.

1:05:30.680 --> 1:05:35.680
 Which again is something that when we think about a nuclear arms race, we think, Jesus, we don't want to go there.

1:05:35.680 --> 1:05:37.680
 It's not done anybody any good.

1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:40.680
 In some ways, maybe it does do good.

1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:43.680
 I don't want to make an argument for nuclear arms.

1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:53.680
 But predation as a mechanism forces organisms to adapt to change to be better to escape or to kill.

1:05:53.680 --> 1:05:55.680
 If you need to eat, then you've got to eat.

1:05:55.680 --> 1:06:03.680
 And a cheetah is not going to run at that speed unless it has to because the zebra is capable of escaping.

1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:09.680
 So it leads to much greater feats of evolution would ever have been possible without it.

1:06:09.680 --> 1:06:12.680
 And in the end, to a much more beautiful world.

1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:17.680
 And so it's not all bad by any means.

1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:20.680
 But the thing is you can't have this if you don't have an oxygenated planet.

1:06:20.680 --> 1:06:25.680
 Because it's all in the end, it's about how much energy can you extract from the food you eat.

1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:31.680
 And if you don't have an oxygenated planet, you can get about 10% out, not much more than that.

1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:35.680
 And if you've got an oxygenated planet, you can get about 40% out.

1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:42.680
 And that means you can have instead of having one or two trophic levels, you can have five or six trophic levels.

1:06:42.680 --> 1:06:45.680
 And that means things can eat things that eat other things and so on.

1:06:45.680 --> 1:06:51.680
 And you've gone to a level of ecological complexity, which is completely impossible in the absence of oxygen.

1:06:51.680 --> 1:07:01.680
 This reminds me of the Hunter S. Thompson quote, that for every moment of triumph, for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.

1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:16.680
 The history of life on earth, unfortunately, is that of violence, just the trillions and trillions of multi cell organisms that were murdered in the struggle for survival.

1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:19.680
 It's a sorry statement, but yes, it's basically true.

1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:29.680
 And that somehow is a catalyst from an evolutionary perspective for creativity, for creating more and more complex organisms that are better and better at surviving.

1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:35.680
 I mean, survival of the fittest, if you just go back to that old phrase, means death the weakest.

1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:40.680
 Now, what's fit, what's weak, these are terms that don't have much intrinsic meaning.

1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:44.680
 But the thing is, evolution only happens because of death.

1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:51.680
 One way to die is the constraints, the scarcity of the resources and the environment.

1:07:51.680 --> 1:08:00.680
 But that seems to be not nearly as good of a mechanism for death than other creatures roaming about in the environment.

1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:03.680
 When I say environment, I mean like the static environment.

1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:09.680
 But then there's the dynamic environment of bigger things trying to eat you and use you for your energy.

1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:18.680
 It forces you to come up with a solution to your specific problem that is inventive and is new and hasn't been done before.

1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:25.680
 And so it forces, I mean, literally change, literally evolution on populations.

1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:27.680
 They have to become different.

1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:39.680
 And it's interesting that humans have channeled that into more, I mean, I guess what humans are doing is they're inventing more productive and safe ways of doing that.

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:49.680
 This whole idea of morality and all those kinds of things, I think they ultimately lead to competition versus violence.

1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:55.680
 Because I think violence can have a cold, brutal, inefficient aspect to it.

1:08:55.680 --> 1:09:04.680
 But if you channel that into more controlled competition in the space of ideas, in the space of approaches to life,

1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:09.680
 maybe you can be even more productive than evolution is.

1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:11.680
 Because evolution is very wasteful.

1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:18.680
 Like the amount of murder required to really test a good idea, genetically speaking, is just a lot.

1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:20.680
 Many, many, many generations.

1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:25.680
 Morally, we cannot base society on the way that evolution works.

1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:26.680
 That's an invention, right?

1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:30.680
 But actually, in some respects, we do, which is to say, this is how science works.

1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:34.680
 We have competing hypotheses that have to get better, otherwise they die.

1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:36.680
 It's the way that society works.

1:09:36.680 --> 1:09:41.680
 In ancient Greece, we had the Athens and Sparta and city states.

1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:44.680
 And then we had the Renaissance and nation states.

1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:47.680
 And universities compete with each other.

1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:51.680
 A tremendous amount of companies competing with each other all the time.

1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:53.680
 It drives innovation.

1:09:53.680 --> 1:10:03.680
 And if we want to do it without all the death that we see in nature, then we have to have some kind of societal level control that says,

1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:06.680
 well, there's some limits, guys, and these are what the limits are going to be.

1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:10.680
 And society as a whole has to say, right, we want to limit the amount of death here.

1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:12.680
 So you can't do this and you can't do that.

1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:13.680
 And who makes up these rules?

1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:14.680
 And how do we know?

1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:22.680
 It's a tough thing, but it's basically trying to find a moral basis for avoiding the death of evolution and natural selection.

1:10:22.680 --> 1:10:26.680
 And keeping the innovation and the richness of it.

1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:31.680
 I forgot who said it, but that murder is illegal.

1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:37.680
 Probably curve, I don't get murder is illegal, except when it's done to the sound of trumpets and at a large scale.

1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:40.680
 So we still have wars.

1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:46.680
 But we are struggling with this idea that murder is a bad thing.

1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:57.680
 It's so interesting how we're channeling the best of the evolutionary imperative and trying to get rid of the stuff that's not productive.

1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:05.680
 So trying to almost accelerate evolution, the same kind of thing that makes evolution creative.

1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:06.680
 We're trying to use that.

1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:08.680
 I think we naturally do it.

1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:10.680
 I mean, I don't think we can help ourselves do it.

1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:16.680
 Capitalism as a form is basically about competition and differential rewards.

1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:22.680
 But society and we have a...

1:11:22.680 --> 1:11:29.680
 I keep using this word moral obligation, but we cannot operate as a society if we go that way.

1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:34.680
 It's interesting that we've had problems achieving balance.

1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:40.680
 So for example, in the financial crash in 2009, do you let banks go to the wall or not?

1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:42.680
 This is kind of question.

1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:44.680
 In evolution, certainly you let them go to the wall.

1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:50.680
 And in that sense, you don't need the regulation because they just die.

1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:58.680
 Whereas if we as a society think about what's required for society as a whole, then you don't necessarily let them go to the wall.

1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:07.680
 In which case you then have to impose some kind of regulation that the bankers themselves will in an evolutionary manner exploit.

1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:08.680
 Yeah.

1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:19.680
 We've been struggling with this kind of idea of capitalism, the cold brutality of capitalism that seems to create so much beautiful things in this world.

1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:26.680
 And then the ideals of communism that seem to create so much brutal destruction in history.

1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:30.680
 And we struggle with ideas of, well, maybe we didn't do it right.

1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:31.680
 How can we do things better?

1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:35.680
 And then the ideas are the things we're playing with as opposed to people.

1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:38.680
 If a PhD student has a bad idea, we don't shoot the PhD student.

1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:41.680
 We just criticize their idea and hope they improve.

1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:43.680
 You have a very humane lamp.

1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:44.680
 Yeah.

1:12:44.680 --> 1:12:46.680
 I don't know how you guys do it.

1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:49.680
 The way I run things, it's always life and death.

1:12:49.680 --> 1:13:01.680
 So it isn't interesting about humans that there is an inner sense of morality, which begs the question of how did homo sapiens evolve?

1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:14.680
 If we think about the invention of early invention of sex and early invention of predation, what was the thing invented to make humans?

1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:16.680
 What would you say?

1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:19.680
 I suppose a couple of things I'd say.

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:26.680
 Number one is you don't have to wind the clock back very far, five, six million years or so, and let it run forwards again.

1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:31.680
 And the chances of humans, as we know them, is not necessarily that high.

1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:36.680
 Imagine as an alien, you find planet Earth and it's got everything apart from humans on it.

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:39.680
 It's an amazing, wonderful, marvelous planet.

1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:45.680
 But nothing that we would recognize as extremely intelligent life and space varying civilization.

1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:51.680
 So when we think about aliens, we're kind of after something like ourselves or after a space faring civilization.

1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:55.680
 We're not after zebras and giraffes and lions and things.

1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:57.680
 Amazing though they are.

1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:12.680
 But the additional kind of evolutionary steps to go from large complex mammals, monkeys, let's say, to humans doesn't strike me as that long a distance.

1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:16.680
 It's all about the brain and where's the brain and morality coming from?

1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:21.680
 It seems to me to be all about groups, human groups and interactions between groups.

1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:23.680
 The collective intelligence of it.

1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:26.680
 Yes, the interactions really.

1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:33.680
 And there's a guy at UCL called Mark Thomas who's done a lot of really beautiful work, I think, on this kind of question.

1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:34.680
 So I talk to him every now and then.

1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:38.680
 So my view is influenced by him.

1:14:38.680 --> 1:14:42.680
 But a lot seems to depend on population density.

1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:56.680
 The more interactions you have going on between different groups, the more transfer of information, if you like, between groups of people moving from one group to another group, almost like lateral gene transfer in bacteria.

1:14:56.680 --> 1:15:07.680
 The more expertise you're able to develop and maintain, the more culturally complex your society can become and groups that have become detached.

1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:13.680
 Like on Easter Island, for example, very often degenerate in terms of the complexity of their civilization.

1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:15.680
 Is that true for complex organisms in general?

1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:18.680
 Population density is often productive.

1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:19.680
 Really matters.

1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:28.680
 But in human terms, I don't know what the actual factors were that were driving a large brain.

1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:30.680
 But you can talk about fire.

1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:32.680
 You can talk about tool use.

1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:33.680
 You can talk about language.

1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:42.680
 And none of them seem to correlate especially well with the actual known trajectory of human evolution in terms of cave art and these kind of things.

1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:50.680
 That seems to work much better just with population density and number of interactions between different groups.

1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:58.680
 All of which is really about human interactions, human human interactions and the complexity of those.

1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:03.680
 But population density is the thing that increases the number of interactions.

1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:14.680
 But then there must have been inventions forced by that number of interactions that actually led to humans.

1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:21.680
 So like Richard Rangham talks about that it's basically the beta males had to beat up the alpha male.

1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:35.680
 So that's what collaboration looks like is when you're living together, our early ancestors don't like the dictatorial aspect of a single individual at the top of a tribe.

1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:46.680
 So they learn to collaborate how to basically create a democracy of sorts, a democracy that prevents, minimizes or lessens the amount of violence.

1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:54.680
 Which essentially gives strength to the tribe and make the war between tribes versus the dictator.

1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:59.680
 I mean, I think one of the most wonderful things about humans is where all of those things.

1:16:59.680 --> 1:17:04.680
 I mean, we are deeply social as a species and we're also deeply selfish.

1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:10.680
 And it seems to me the conflict between capitalism and communism is really just two aspects of human nature, both of which are.

1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:11.680
 We have both.

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:12.680
 We have both.

1:17:12.680 --> 1:17:15.680
 And we have a constant kind of vying between the two sides.

1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:20.680
 We really do care about other people beyond our families, beyond our immediate people.

1:17:20.680 --> 1:17:23.680
 We care about society and the society that we live in.

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:28.680
 And you could say that's a, you know, a drawing towards socialism or communism on the other side.

1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:30.680
 We really do care about ourselves.

1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:34.680
 We really do care about our families about working for something that we gain from.

1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:35.680
 And that's the capitalist side of it.

1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:38.680
 They're both really deeply ingrained in human nature.

1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:46.680
 In terms of violence and interactions between groups, yes, all this dynamic of if you're interacting between groups,

1:17:46.680 --> 1:17:52.680
 you can be certain that they're going to be burning each other and all kinds of physical violent interactions as well,

1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:57.680
 which will drive the kind of cleverness of how do you resist this?

1:17:57.680 --> 1:17:58.680
 Let's build a tower.

1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:04.680
 Let's see, what are we going to do to prevent being overrun by those marauding gangs from over there?

1:18:04.680 --> 1:18:10.680
 And you look, you look outside humans and you look at chimps and bonobos and so on,

1:18:10.680 --> 1:18:12.680
 and they're very, very different structures to society.

1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:18.680
 Chimps tend to have an aggressive alpha male type structure and bonobos are, you know,

1:18:18.680 --> 1:18:22.680
 there's basically a female society where the males are predominantly excluded

1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:24.680
 and only brought in at the behest of the female.

1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:28.680
 We have a lot in common with both of those groups.

1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:30.680
 And there's again tension there.

1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:34.680
 And probably chimps, more violence of bonobos, probably more sex.

1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:36.680
 That's another tension.

1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:41.680
 How serious do we want to be?

1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:43.680
 How much fun we want to be?

1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:47.680
 Asking for a friend again, what do you think happened to Neanderthals?

1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:52.680
 What did we cheeky humans do to the Neanderthals, homo sapiens?

1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:54.680
 Do you think we murdered them?

1:18:54.680 --> 1:18:56.680
 How do we murder them?

1:18:56.680 --> 1:18:58.680
 How do we outcompete them?

1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:00.680
 Do we outmate them?

1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:01.680
 I don't know.

1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:05.680
 I mean, I think there's unequivocal evidence that we mated with them.

1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:07.680
 We always try to mate with everything.

1:19:07.680 --> 1:19:08.680
 Yes, pretty much.

1:19:08.680 --> 1:19:13.680
 There's some interesting, the first sequences that came along were in mitochondrial DNA.

1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:17.680
 And that was back to about 2002 or thereabouts.

1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:22.680
 What was found was that Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA was very different to human mitochondria.

1:19:22.680 --> 1:19:23.680
 Oh, that's so interesting.

1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:28.680
 You could do a clock on it and they said the divergent state was about 600,000 years ago or something like that.

1:19:28.680 --> 1:19:30.680
 So not so long ago.

1:19:30.680 --> 1:19:35.680
 And then the first full genomes were sequenced maybe 10 years after that.

1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:39.680
 And they showed plenty of signs of mating between.

1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:42.680
 So the mitochondrial DNA effectively says no mating.

1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:47.680
 And the nuclear genes say, yeah, lots of mating.

1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:53.680
 So can you explain the difference between mitochondrial DNA and nucleus?

1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:56.680
 I've talked before about the mitochondria, which are the power packs in cells.

1:19:56.680 --> 1:20:00.680
 These are the paired down control units is their DNA.

1:20:00.680 --> 1:20:03.680
 So it's passed on by the mother only.

1:20:03.680 --> 1:20:09.680
 And in the egg cell, we might have half a million copies of mitochondrial DNA.

1:20:09.680 --> 1:20:16.680
 There's only 37 genes left and they do basically the control unit of energy production.

1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:18.680
 That's what it's doing.

1:20:18.680 --> 1:20:21.680
 It's a basic old school machine that does.

1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:28.680
 And it's got genes that were considered to be effectively trivial because they did a very narrowly defined job.

1:20:28.680 --> 1:20:35.680
 But they're not trivial in the sense that that narrowly defined job is about everything that is being alive.

1:20:35.680 --> 1:20:37.680
 So they're much easier to sequence.

1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:41.680
 You've got many more copies of these things and you can sequence them very quickly.

1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:49.680
 But the problem is because they go down only the maternal line from mother to daughter, your mitochondrial DNA and mine is going nowhere.

1:20:49.680 --> 1:20:51.680
 Doesn't matter any kids we have.

1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:59.680
 They get their mother's mitochondrial DNA, except in very, very rare and strange circumstances.

1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:06.680
 And so it tells a different story and it's not a story which is easy to reconcile always.

1:21:06.680 --> 1:21:17.680
 And what it seems to suggest to my mind at least is that there was one way traffic of genes probably going from humans into Neanderthals rather than the other way around.

1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:19.680
 Why did the Neanderthals disappear?

1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:20.680
 I don't know.

1:21:20.680 --> 1:21:31.680
 I suspect that they were probably less violent, less clever, less populace, less willing to fight.

1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:32.680
 I don't know.

1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:36.680
 I mean, I think I already drove them to extinction at the margins of Europe.

1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:55.680
 And it's interesting how much, if we ran Earth over and over again, how many of these branches of intelligent beings that have figured out some kind of how to leverage collective intelligence, which ones of them emerge, which ones of them succeed?

1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:57.680
 Is it the more violent ones?

1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:01.680
 Is it the more isolated ones?

1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:03.680
 What dynamics result in more productivity?

1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:05.680
 And I suppose we'll never know.

1:22:05.680 --> 1:22:10.680
 The more complex the organism, the harder it is to run the experiment in the lab.

1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:11.680
 Yes.

1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:14.680
 And in some respects, maybe it's best if we don't know.

1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:15.680
 Yeah.

1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:17.680
 The truth might be very painful.

1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:24.680
 What about if we actually step back a couple of interesting things that we humans do?

1:22:24.680 --> 1:22:28.680
 One is object manipulation and movement.

1:22:28.680 --> 1:22:31.680
 And of course, movement was something that was done.

1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:35.680
 That was another big invention, being able to move around the environment.

1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:40.680
 And the other one is this sensory mechanism, how we sense the environment.

1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:44.680
 One of the coolest, high definition ones is vision.

1:22:44.680 --> 1:22:50.680
 How big are those inventions in the history of life on Earth?

1:22:50.680 --> 1:23:00.680
 Vision, movement, again, extremely important, going back to the origin of animals, the Cambrian explosion, where suddenly you're seeing eyes in the fossil record.

1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:07.680
 And it's not necessarily, again, lots of people historically have said what use is half an eye.

1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:20.680
 You can go in a series of steps from a light sensitive spot on a flat piece of tissue to an eyeball with a lens and so on.

1:23:20.680 --> 1:23:29.680
 If you assume no more than, I don't remember this, but this was a specific model that I have in mind, but it was one percent change or half a percent change for each generation.

1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:31.680
 How long would it take to evolve an eye as we know it?

1:23:31.680 --> 1:23:33.680
 And the answer is half a million years.

1:23:33.680 --> 1:23:38.680
 It doesn't have to take long. That's not how evolution works. That's not an answer to the question.

1:23:38.680 --> 1:23:44.680
 It just shows you can reconstruct the steps and you can work out roughly how it can work.

1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:48.680
 So it's not that big a deal to evolve an eye.

1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:51.680
 But once you have one, then there's no way to hide.

1:23:51.680 --> 1:23:54.680
 And again, we're back to predator prey relationships.

1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:57.680
 We're back to all the benefits that being able to see brings you.

1:23:57.680 --> 1:24:03.680
 And if you think philosophically what bats are doing with the eco location and so on, I have no idea.

1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:07.680
 But I suspect that they form an image of the world in pretty much the same way that we do.

1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:09.680
 It's just a matter of mental reconstruction.

1:24:09.680 --> 1:24:21.680
 So I suppose the other thing about sight, there are single celled organisms that have got a lens and a retina and a cornea and so on.

1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:24.680
 Basically, they've got a camera tie by in a single cell.

1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:26.680
 They don't have a brain.

1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:30.680
 What they understand about their world is impossible to say.

1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:34.680
 But they're capable of coming up with the same structures to do so.

1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:38.680
 So I suppose then is that once you've got things like eyes,

1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:43.680
 then you have a big driving pressure on the central nervous system to figure out what it all means.

1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:47.680
 And we come around to your other point about manipulation, sensory input and so on.

1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:58.680
 Now you have a huge requirement to understand what your environment is and what it means and how it reacts and where you should run away and where you should stay put.

1:24:58.680 --> 1:25:08.680
 Actually, on that point, let me, I don't know if you know the work of Donald Hoffman who talks about, who uses the argument,

1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:22.680
 the mechanism of evolution to say that there's not necessarily a strong evolutionary value to seeing the world as it is.

1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:29.680
 So objective reality, that our perception actually is very different from what's objectively real.

1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:41.680
 We're living inside an illusion and we're basically the entire set of species on Earth, I think, I guess are competing in a space that's an illusion that's distinct from,

1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:45.680
 that's far away from physical reality as it is defined by physics.

1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:48.680
 I'm not sure it's an illusion so much as a bubble.

1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:53.680
 I mean, we have a sensory input which is a fraction of what we could have a sensory input on.

1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:57.680
 And we interpret it in terms of what's useful for us to know to stay alive.

1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:03.680
 So yes, it's an illusion in that sense, but the tree is physically there.

1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:09.680
 And if you walk into that tree, there is, it's not purely a delusion of some physical reality to it.

1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:18.680
 So it's a sensory slice into reality as it is, but because it's just a slice, you're missing a big picture.

1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:25.680
 But he says that that slice doesn't necessarily need to be a slice, it could be a complete fabrication.

1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:39.680
 That's just consistent amongst the species, which is an interesting or at least it's a humbling realization that our perception is limited and our cognitive abilities are limited.

1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:44.680
 And at least to me, it's argument from evolution.

1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:54.680
 I don't know how much, how strong that is as an argument, but I do think that life can exist in the mind.

1:26:54.680 --> 1:26:56.680
 Yes.

1:26:56.680 --> 1:27:02.680
 In the same way that you can do a virtual reality video game and you can have a vibrant life inside that place.

1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:13.680
 And that place is not real in some sense, but you can still have a vibrant, all the same forces of evolution, all the same competition, the dynamics between humans you can have.

1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:23.680
 But I don't know if, I don't know if there's evidence for that being the thing that happened on Earth.

1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:24.680
 It seems that Earth...

1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:29.680
 I think in either environment, I wouldn't deny that you could have exactly the world that you talk about.

1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:41.680
 And it would be very difficult to, you know, the idea in Matrix movies and so on that the whole world is completely a construction.

1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:43.680
 And we're fundamentally deluded.

1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:51.680
 It's difficult to say that's impossible or couldn't happen and certainly we construct in our minds what the outside world is.

1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:59.680
 But we do it on input and that input, I would hesitate to say it's not real because it's precisely how we do understand the world.

1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:08.680
 We, you know, we have eyes, but if you keep someone in this, apparently this kind of thing happens, someone kept in a dark room for five years or something like that.

1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:17.680
 And they never see properly again, because the neural wiring that underpins how we interpret vision never developed.

1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:24.680
 You know, you need, when you watch a child develop, it walks into a table, it bangs his head on the table and it hurts.

1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:27.680
 And now you've got two inputs.

1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:32.680
 You've got one pain from this sharp edge and number two, you've touched it and realized it's there.

1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:37.680
 It's a sharp edge and you've got the visual input and you put the three things together and think, I don't want to walk into a table again.

1:28:37.680 --> 1:28:42.680
 So you're learning and it's a limited reality, but it's a true reality.

1:28:42.680 --> 1:28:48.680
 And if you don't learn that properly, then you will get eaten, you will get hit by a bus, you will not survive.

1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:55.680
 And same if you're in some kind of, let's say, computer construction of reality.

1:28:55.680 --> 1:29:04.680
 I'm not in my ground here, but if you construct the laws that this is what reality is inside this, then you play by those laws.

1:29:04.680 --> 1:29:06.680
 Yeah, well, I mean, as long as the laws are consistent.

1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:14.680
 So just like you said in the lab, the interesting thing about the simulation question, yes, it's hard to know if we're living inside a simulation,

1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:19.680
 but also, yes, it's possible to do these kinds of experiments in the lab now.

1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:29.680
 More and more, to me, the interesting question is how realistic does a virtual reality game need to be for us to not be able to tell the difference?

1:29:29.680 --> 1:29:42.680
 A more interesting question to me is how realistic or interesting does a virtual reality world need to be in order for us to want to stay there forever,

1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:47.680
 or much longer than physical reality, prefer that place.

1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:57.680
 And also prefer it not as we prefer hard drugs, but prefer it in a deep, meaningful way in the way we enjoy life.

1:29:57.680 --> 1:30:06.680
 I mean, I suppose the issue with the matrix, I imagine that it's possible to delude the mind sufficiently that you genuinely, in that way,

1:30:06.680 --> 1:30:13.680
 do think that you are interacting with the real world when, in fact, the whole thing's a simulation.

1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:16.680
 How good does a simulation need to be to be able to do that?

1:30:16.680 --> 1:30:26.680
 Well, it needs to convince you that all your sensory input is correct and accurate and joins up and makes sense.

1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:32.680
 Now, that sensory input is not something that we're born with, we're born with a sense of touch, we're born with eyes and so on,

1:30:32.680 --> 1:30:35.680
 but we don't know how to use them, we don't know what to make of them.

1:30:35.680 --> 1:30:47.680
 We go around, we bump into trees, we cry a lot, we're in pain a lot, we're basically booting up the system so that it can make head a tail of the sensory input that it's getting.

1:30:47.680 --> 1:30:53.680
 And that sensory input is not just a one way flux of things, it's also you have to walk into things, you have to hear things, you have to put it together.

1:30:53.680 --> 1:31:02.680
 Now, if you've got just babies in the matrix who are slotted into this, I don't think they have that kind of sensory input.

1:31:02.680 --> 1:31:08.680
 I don't think they would have any way to make sense of New York as a world that they're part of.

1:31:08.680 --> 1:31:10.680
 The brain is just not developed in that way.

1:31:10.680 --> 1:31:13.680
 Well, I can't make sense of New York in this physical reality either.

1:31:13.680 --> 1:31:25.680
 But you said pain and the walking into things, well, you can create a pain signal and as long as it's consistent that certain things result in pain, you can start to construct a reality.

1:31:25.680 --> 1:31:38.680
 There are some, maybe you disagree with this, but I think we are born almost with a desire to be convinced by our reality, like a desire to make sense of our reality.

1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:39.680
 Oh, I'm sure we are, yes.

1:31:39.680 --> 1:31:55.680
 So there's an imperative, so whatever that reality is given to us, like the table hurts, fire is hot, I think we want to be deluded in the sense that we want to make a simple Einstein simple theory of the thing around us.

1:31:55.680 --> 1:31:57.680
 We want that simplicity.

1:31:57.680 --> 1:32:07.680
 And so maybe the hunger for the simplicity is the thing that could be used to construct a pretty dumb simulation that tricks us.

1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:10.680
 So maybe tricking humans doesn't require building a universe.

1:32:10.680 --> 1:32:15.680
 No, I don't, I mean, this is not what I work on, so I don't know how close to it we are.

1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:25.680
 But I agree with you that, yeah, I'm not sure that it's a morally justifiable thing to do, but is it possible in principle?

1:32:25.680 --> 1:32:31.680
 I think it would be very difficult, but I don't see why in principle it wouldn't be possible.

1:32:31.680 --> 1:32:41.680
 I agree with you that we try to understand the world, we try to integrate the sensory inputs that we have, and we try to come up with a hypothesis that explains what's going on.

1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:48.680
 I think, though, that we have huge input from the social context that we're in.

1:32:48.680 --> 1:32:50.680
 We don't do it by ourselves.

1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:55.680
 We don't kind of blunder around in a universe by ourselves and understand the whole thing.

1:32:55.680 --> 1:33:01.680
 We're told by the people around us what things are and what they do and languages coming in here and so on.

1:33:01.680 --> 1:33:07.680
 So it would have to be an extremely impressive simulation to simulate all of that.

1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:15.680
 Yeah, simulate all of that, including the social construct, the thing, the spread of ideas and the exchange of ideas.

1:33:15.680 --> 1:33:21.680
 I don't know, but those questions are really important to understand as we become more and more digital creatures.

1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:25.680
 It seems like the next step of evolution is us becoming partial.

1:33:25.680 --> 1:33:31.680
 All the same mechanisms we've talked about are becoming more and more plugged in into the machine.

1:33:31.680 --> 1:33:43.680
 We're becoming cyborgs, and there's an interesting interplay between wires and biology, you know, zeros and ones and the biological systems.

1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:52.680
 I don't think we'll have the luxury to see humans as disjoint from the technology we've created for much longer.

1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:55.680
 We are an organism that's...

1:33:55.680 --> 1:34:07.680
 Yeah, I mean, I agree with you, but we come really with this to consciousness and is there a distinction there?

1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:16.680
 Because what you're saying, the natural end point says we are indistinguishable that if you are capable of building an AI

1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:27.680
 which is sufficiently close and similar that we merge with it, then to all intents and purposes, that AI is conscious as we know it.

1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:34.680
 And I don't have a strong view, but I have a view.

1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:45.680
 And I wrote about it in the epilogue to my last book because 10 years ago I wrote a chapter in a book called Life Ascending about consciousness.

1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:53.680
 And the subtitle of Life Ascending was the 10 Great Inventions of Evolution, and I couldn't possibly write a book with a subtitle like that that did not include consciousness,

1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:58.680
 and specifically consciousness as one of the great inventions.

1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:05.680
 And it was in part because I was just curious to know more and I read more for that chapter. I never worked on it, but I've always...

1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:08.680
 How can anyone not be interested in the question?

1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:20.680
 And I was left with the feeling that A, nobody knows, and B, there are two main schools of thought out there with a big kind of skew in distribution.

1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:29.680
 One of them says, oh, it's a property of matter, it's an unknown law of physics, panpsychism, everything is conscious, the sun is conscious, it's just a matter of...

1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:32.680
 Or a rock is conscious, it's just a matter of how much.

1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:35.680
 And I find that very unpersuasive.

1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:44.680
 I can't say that it's wrong, it's just that I think we somehow can tell the difference between something that's living and something that's not.

1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:51.680
 And then the other end is it's an emergent property of a very complex central nervous system.

1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:58.680
 And I never quite understand what people mean by words like emergence.

1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:08.680
 I mean, there are genuine examples, which I think we very often tend to use it to plaster over ignorance.

1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:16.680
 As a biochemist, the question for me then was, okay, it's a concoction of a central nervous system.

1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:27.680
 A depolarizing neuron gives rise to a feeling, to a feeling of pain, or to a feeling of love, or anger, or whatever it may be.

1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:31.680
 So what is then a feeling in biophysical terms in the central nervous system?

1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:40.680
 Which bit of the wiring gives rise to... And I've never seen anyone answer that question in a way that makes sense to me.

1:36:40.680 --> 1:36:43.680
 And that's an important question to answer.

1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:46.680
 I think if we want to understand consciousness, that's the only question to answer.

1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:54.680
 Because certainly an AI is capable of out thinking and it's only a matter of time, maybe it's already happened.

1:36:54.680 --> 1:36:59.680
 In terms of just information processing and computational skill,

1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:06.680
 I don't think we have any problem in designing a mind which is at least the equal of the human mind.

1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:19.680
 But in terms of what we value the most as humans, which is to say our feelings, our emotions, our sense of what the world is in a very personal way,

1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:24.680
 that I think means as much or more to people than their information processing.

1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:32.680
 And that's where I don't think that AI necessarily will become conscious because I think it's the property of life.

1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:36.680
 Well, let's talk about it more. You're an incredible writer. What are my favorite writers?

1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:42.680
 So let me read from your latest book, Transformers, what you write about consciousness.

1:37:42.680 --> 1:37:48.680
 I think therefore I am, said Descartes, is one of the most celebrated lines ever written.

1:37:48.680 --> 1:37:51.680
 But what am I exactly?

1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:56.680
 An artificial intelligence can think too, by definition, and therefore is.

1:37:56.680 --> 1:38:06.680
 Yet few of us could agree whether AI is capable in principle of anything resembling human emotions, of love or hate, fear and joy,

1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:13.680
 of spiritual yearnings for oneness or oblivion or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger.

1:38:13.680 --> 1:38:19.680
 The problem is we don't know what emotions are, as you were saying.

1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:25.680
 What is the feeling in physical terms? How does a discharging neuron give rise to a feeling of anything at all?

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:28.680
 This is the hard problem of consciousness.

1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:34.680
 The seeming duality of mind and matter, the physical makeup of our innermost self.

1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:41.680
 We can understand in principle how an extremely sophisticated parallel processing system could be capable of wondrous feats of intelligence.

1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:48.680
 But we can't answer in principle whether such a supreme intelligence would experience joy or melancholy.

1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:52.680
 What is the quantum of solace?

1:38:52.680 --> 1:39:00.680
 I, speaking to the question of emergence, you know, there's just technical...

1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:07.680
 There's an excellent paper on this recently about this kind of phase transition,

1:39:07.680 --> 1:39:14.680
 emergence of performance in neural networks on the problem of NLP, natural language processing.

1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:18.680
 So language models, there seems to be this question of size.

1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:25.680
 At some point, there is a phase transition as you grow the size of the neural network.

1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:31.680
 So the question is somewhat of a technical question that you can philosophize over.

1:39:31.680 --> 1:39:40.680
 The technical question is, is there a size of a neural network that starts to be able to form the kind of representations that can capture a language

1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:50.680
 and therefore be able to not just language, but linguistically capture knowledge that's sufficient to solve a lot of problems in language,

1:39:50.680 --> 1:39:52.680
 like be able to have a conversation.

1:39:52.680 --> 1:39:56.680
 And there seems to be not a gradual increase, but a phase transition.

1:39:56.680 --> 1:40:00.680
 And they're trying to construct the science of where that is.

1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:03.680
 Like, what is the good size of a neural network?

1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:05.680
 And why does such a phase transition happen?

1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:08.680
 Anyway, that sort of points to emergence.

1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:23.680
 That there could be stages where a thing goes from being, oh, you're very intelligent toaster to a toaster that's feeling sad today

1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:30.680
 and turns away and looks out the window, sighing, having an existential crisis.

1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:32.680
 I was thinking of Marvin, the paranoid android.

1:40:32.680 --> 1:40:37.680
 Exactly. Well, no, Marvin is simplistic because Marvin is just cranky.

1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:39.680
 Yes.

1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:41.680
 So easily programmed.

1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:44.680
 Yeah, easily programmed, nonstop existential crisis.

1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:52.680
 You're almost basically, what is it, notes from underground, but just constantly complaining about life.

1:40:52.680 --> 1:41:03.680
 No, they're capturing the full rollercoaster of human emotion, the excitement, the bliss, the connection, the empathy and all that kind of stuff.

1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:09.680
 And then the selfishness, the anger, the depression, all that kind of stuff.

1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:13.680
 They're capturing all of that and be able to experience it deeply.

1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:17.680
 Like it's the most important thing you could possibly experience today.

1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:20.680
 The highest highs, the lowest lows, this is it.

1:41:20.680 --> 1:41:22.680
 My life will be over.

1:41:22.680 --> 1:41:29.680
 I cannot possibly go on that feeling and then like after a nap, you're feeling amazing.

1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:33.680
 That might be something that emerges.

1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:41.680
 So why would a nap make an AI being feel better?

1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:44.680
 First of all, we don't know that for a human either, right?

1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:48.680
 But we do know that that's actually true for many people much of the time.

1:41:48.680 --> 1:41:52.680
 Maybe you're depressed and you have an app and you do, in fact, feel better.

1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:59.680
 Oh, you are actually asking the technical question there, so there's a biological answer to that.

1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:16.680
 And so the question is whether AI needs to have the same kind of attachments to its body, bodily function, preservation of the brain's successful function, self preservation essentially in some deep biological sense.

1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:27.680
 I mean, to my mind, it comes back round to the problem we were talking about before about simulations and sensory input and learning what all of this stuff means.

1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:35.680
 And life and death, that biology, unlike society, has a death penalty over everything.

1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:38.680
 And natural selection works on that death penalty.

1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:46.680
 That if you make this decision wrongly, you die.

1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:55.680
 And the next generation is represented by beings that made a slightly different decision on balance.

1:42:55.680 --> 1:43:05.680
 And that is something that's intrinsically difficult to simulate in all this richness, I would say.

1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:08.680
 So what is...

1:43:08.680 --> 1:43:11.680
 Death in all its richness.

1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:16.680
 Our relationship with death or the whole of it.

1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:21.680
 So when you say richness, of course, there's a lot in that.

1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:23.680
 Which is hard to simulate?

1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:27.680
 What's part of the richness that's hard to simulate?

1:43:27.680 --> 1:43:37.680
 I suppose the complexity of the environment and your position of an organism in that environment, in the full richness of that environment,

1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:43.680
 over its entire life, over multiple generations, with changes in gene sequence over those generations.

1:43:43.680 --> 1:43:47.680
 So slight changes in the makeup of those individuals over generations.

1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:53.680
 But if you take it back to the level of single cells, which I do in the book,

1:43:53.680 --> 1:44:01.680
 and ask how does a single cell in effect know it exists as an unit, as an entity?

1:44:01.680 --> 1:44:06.680
 I mean, no, in inverted commas, obviously it doesn't know anything.

1:44:06.680 --> 1:44:13.680
 But it acts as a unit and it acts with astonishing precision as a unit.

1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:19.680
 And I had suggested that that's linked to the electrical fields on the membranes themselves.

1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:27.680
 And that they give some indication of how am I doing in relation to my environment as a kind of real time feedback on the world.

1:44:27.680 --> 1:44:34.680
 And this is something physical, which can be selected over generations.

1:44:34.680 --> 1:44:41.680
 That if you are, if you get this wrong, it's linked with this set of circumstances.

1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:50.680
 As an individual, I have a moment of blind panic and run as a bacterium or something.

1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:56.680
 You have some electrical discharge that says blind panic and it runs whatever it may be.

1:44:56.680 --> 1:45:06.680
 And you associate over generations, multiple generations, that this electrical phase that I'm in now is associated with a response like that.

1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:21.680
 And it's easy to see how feelings come in through the back door almost with that kind of giving real time feedback on your position in the world in relation to how am I doing?

1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:23.680
 And then you complexify the system.

1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:27.680
 And yes, I have no problem with phase transition.

1:45:27.680 --> 1:45:41.680
 And can all of this be done purely by the language, by the issues with how the system understands itself?

1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:44.680
 Maybe it can, I honestly don't know.

1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:58.680
 But the philosophers for a long time have talked about the possibility that you can have a zombie intelligence and that there are no feelings there, but everything else is the same.

1:45:58.680 --> 1:46:00.680
 I mean, I have to throw this back to you really.

1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:03.680
 How do you deal with a zombie intelligence?

1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:12.680
 So first of all, I can see that from a biologist perspective, you think of all the complexities that led up to the human being.

1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:24.680
 The entirety of the history of four billion years that in some deep sense integrated the human being into this environment and that dance of the organism and the environment.

1:46:24.680 --> 1:46:31.680
 You could see how emotions arise from that and their emotions are deeply connected and creating a human experience.

1:46:31.680 --> 1:46:36.680
 And from that you mix in consciousness and the full mess of it.

1:46:36.680 --> 1:46:51.680
 But from a perspective of an intelligent organism that's already here, like a baby that learns, it doesn't need to learn how to be a collection of cells or how to do all the things he needs to do.

1:46:51.680 --> 1:47:06.680
 The basic function of a baby as it learns is to interact with its environment, to learn from its environment, to learn how to fit in to the social society.

1:47:06.680 --> 1:47:08.680
 And the basic response of the baby is to cry a lot of the time.

1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:24.680
 Well, maybe convince the humans to protect it or to discipline it, to teach it. We've developed a bunch of different tricks, how to get our parents to take care of us, to educate us, to teach us about the world.

1:47:24.680 --> 1:47:32.680
 Also, we've constructed the world in such a way that it's safe enough for us to survive in and yet dangerous enough for learning the valuable lessons.

1:47:32.680 --> 1:47:38.680
 The tables are still hard with corners, so it can still run into them. It hurts like hell.

1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:53.680
 So AI needs to solve that problem, not the problem of constructing this super complex organism that leads up to make an apple pie to build the whole universe.

1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:55.680
 You need to build the whole universe.

1:47:55.680 --> 1:48:18.680
 I think the zombie question is something I would leave to the philosophers, and I will also leave to them the definition of love and what happens between two human beings when there's a magic that just grabs them.

1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:27.680
 Like nothing else matters in the world and somehow you've been searching for this feeling, this moment, this person, your whole life, that feeling.

1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:36.680
 The philosophers can have a lot of fun with that one and also say that that's just, you can have a biological explanation, you can have all kinds of, it's all fake.

1:48:36.680 --> 1:48:43.680
 It's actually, I'm Rand will say it's all selfish. There's a lot of different interpretations. I'll leave it to the philosophers.

1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:55.680
 The point is the feeling, sure as hell feels very real. And if my toaster makes me feel like it's the only toaster in the world.

1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:10.680
 And when I leave and I miss the toaster and when I come back, I'm excited to see the toaster and my life is meaningful and joyful and the friends I have around me get a better version of me because that toaster exists.

1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:15.680
 That sure as hell feels like a conscious toaster. Is that psychologically different to having a dog?

1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:16.680
 No.

1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:24.680
 Because I mean, most people would dispute whether we can say a dog. I would say a dog is undoubtedly conscious, but some people would say it doesn't.

1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:32.680
 But there's degrees of consciousness and so on, but people are definitely much more uncomfortable saying a toaster can be conscious than a dog.

1:49:32.680 --> 1:49:41.680
 And there's still a deep connection. You could say our relationship with the dog has more to do with anthropomorphism, like we kind of project the human being onto it.

1:49:41.680 --> 1:49:42.680
 Maybe.

1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:45.680
 We can do the same damn thing with a toaster.

1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:53.680
 Yes. But you can look into the dog's eyes and you can see that it's sad that it's delighted to see you again. I don't have a dog, by the way.

1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:58.680
 And a dog is actually incredibly good at using their eyes to do just that.

1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:11.680
 They are. Now, I don't imagine that a dog is remotely as close to being intelligent as an AI intelligence, but it's certainly capable of communicating emotionally with us.

1:50:11.680 --> 1:50:20.680
 But here's what I would venture to say. We tend to think because AI plays chess well and is able to fold proteins now well that it's intelligent.

1:50:20.680 --> 1:50:28.680
 I would argue that in order to communicate with humans in order to have emotional intelligence, it actually requires another order of magnitude of intelligence.

1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:33.680
 It's not easy to be flawed.

1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:41.680
 Solving a mathematical puzzle is not the same as the full complexity of human to human interaction.

1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:51.680
 That's actually, we humans just take for granted the things we're really good at. Nonstop people tell me how shitty people are driving.

1:50:51.680 --> 1:50:55.680
 No. Humans are incredible at driving.

1:50:55.680 --> 1:51:01.680
 Bipedal walking, walking, object manipulation, we're incredible at this.

1:51:01.680 --> 1:51:06.680
 And so people tend to discount the things we all just take for granted.

1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:14.680
 And one of those things that they discount is our ability, the dance of conversation and interaction with each other.

1:51:14.680 --> 1:51:21.680
 The ability to morph ideas together, the ability to get angry at each other and then to miss each other.

1:51:21.680 --> 1:51:27.680
 Like to create attention that makes life fun and difficult and challenging in a way that's meaningful.

1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:32.680
 That is a skill that's learned and AI would need to solve that problem.

1:51:32.680 --> 1:51:41.680
 I mean, in some sense, what you're saying is AI cannot become meaningfully emotional, let's say,

1:51:41.680 --> 1:51:53.680
 until it experiences some kind of internal conflict that is unable to reconcile these various aspects of reality or its reality with a decision to make.

1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:58.680
 And then it feels sad necessarily because it doesn't know what to do.

1:51:58.680 --> 1:52:02.680
 And I certainly can't dispute that. That may very well be how it works.

1:52:02.680 --> 1:52:05.680
 I think the only way to find out is to do it.

1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:10.680
 To build it, yeah. And leave it to the philosophers if it actually feels sad or not.

1:52:10.680 --> 1:52:16.680
 The point is the robot will be sitting there alone having an internal conflict, an existential crisis,

1:52:16.680 --> 1:52:20.680
 and that's required for it to have a deep, meaningful connection with another human being.

1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:23.680
 Now, does it actually feel that? I don't know.

1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:30.680
 But I'd like to throw something else at you, which troubles me on reading it.

1:52:30.680 --> 1:52:34.680
 Noah Harar is book 21, Lessons for the 21st Century.

1:52:34.680 --> 1:52:37.680
 And he's written about this kind of thing on various occasions.

1:52:37.680 --> 1:52:40.680
 And he sees biochemistry as an algorithm.

1:52:40.680 --> 1:52:46.680
 And then AI will necessarily be able to hack that algorithm and do it better than humans.

1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:53.680
 So there will be AI better at writing music that we appreciate than Mozart ever could or writing better than Shakespeare ever did and so on.

1:52:53.680 --> 1:53:02.680
 Because biochemistry is algorithmic and all you need to do is figure out which bits of the algorithm to play to make us feel good or bad or appreciate things.

1:53:02.680 --> 1:53:12.680
 And as a biochemist, I find that argument close to irrefutable and not very enjoyable.

1:53:12.680 --> 1:53:16.680
 I don't like the sound of it. That's just my reaction as a human being.

1:53:16.680 --> 1:53:25.680
 You might like the sound of it because that says that AI is capable of the same kind of emotional feelings about the world as we are.

1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:30.680
 Because the whole thing is an algorithm and you can program an algorithm and there you are.

1:53:30.680 --> 1:53:37.680
 He then has a peculiar final chapter where he talks about consciousness in rather separate terms.

1:53:37.680 --> 1:53:42.680
 And he's talking about meditating and so on and getting in touch with his inner conscious. I don't meditate.

1:53:42.680 --> 1:53:44.680
 I don't know anything about that.

1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:51.680
 But he wrote in very different terms about it as if somehow it's a way out of the algorithm.

1:53:51.680 --> 1:53:58.680
 Now, it seems to me that consciousness in that sense is capable of scuppering the algorithm.

1:53:58.680 --> 1:54:04.680
 I think in terms of the biochemical feedback loops and so on, it is undoubtedly algorithmic.

1:54:04.680 --> 1:54:14.680
 But in terms of what we decide to do, it can be much more based on an emotion.

1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:21.680
 We can just think, I don't care. I can't resolve this complex situation. I'm going to do that.

1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:29.680
 And that can be based on, in effect, a different currency, which is the currency of feelings and something where we don't have very much personal control over.

1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:34.680
 And then it comes back around to you and what are you trying to get at with AI?

1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:44.680
 Do we need to have some system which is capable of overriding a rational decision which cannot be made because there's too much conflicting information

1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:50.680
 by effectively an emotional judgmental decision that just says, do this and see what happens.

1:54:50.680 --> 1:54:52.680
 That's what consciousness is really doing, in my view.

1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:58.680
 Yeah. And the question is whether it's a different process or just a higher level process.

1:54:58.680 --> 1:55:06.680
 The idea that biochemistry is an algorithm is, to me, an oversimplistic view.

1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:20.680
 There's a lot of things that, the moment you say it, it's irrefutable, but it simplifies and in the process loses something fundamental.

1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:29.680
 So, for example, calling a universe and an information processing system, sure, yes. You can make that.

1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:42.680
 It's a computer that's performing computations, but you're missing the process of the entropy somehow leading to pockets of complexity

1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:48.680
 that creates these beautiful artifacts that are incredibly complex and they're like machines.

1:55:48.680 --> 1:55:53.680
 And then those machines are through the process of evolution are constructing even further complexity.

1:55:53.680 --> 1:56:04.680
 In calling a universe and information processing machine, you're missing those little local pockets and how difficult it is to create them.

1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:13.680
 So, the question to me is, if biochemistry is an algorithm, how difficult is it to create a software system that runs the human body,

1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:19.680
 which I think is incorrect. I think that is going to take so long.

1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:24.680
 I mean, that's going to be centuries from now to be able to reconstruct the human.

1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:33.680
 Now, what I would venture to say to get some of the magic of a human being, what we're saying with the emotions and the interactions

1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:38.680
 and like a dog makes a smile and joyful and all those kinds of things, that will come much sooner.

1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:43.680
 But that doesn't require us to reverse engineer the algorithm of biochemistry.

1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:46.680
 Yes, but the toaster is making you happy.

1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:47.680
 Yes.

1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:50.680
 It's not about whether you make the toaster happy.

1:56:50.680 --> 1:56:52.680
 No, it has to be.

1:56:52.680 --> 1:56:57.680
 It has to be. It has to be. The toaster has to be able to leave me.

1:56:57.680 --> 1:56:59.680
 Yes, but it's the toaster is the AI in this case.

1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:05.680
 The toaster has to be able to be unhappy and leave me. That's essential.

1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:08.680
 Yeah, that's essential for my being able to miss the toaster.

1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:15.680
 If the toaster is just my servant, that's not or a provider of like services.

1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:22.680
 Like tells me the weather makes toast. That's not going to deep connection.

1:57:22.680 --> 1:57:26.680
 It has to have internal conflict. You write about life and death.

1:57:26.680 --> 1:57:32.680
 It has to be able to be conscious of its mortality and the finiteness of its existence.

1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:37.680
 And that life is for its temporary and therefore needs to be more selective.

1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:44.680
 One of the most moving moments in the movies from when I was a boy was the unplugging of Hal in 2001,

1:57:44.680 --> 1:57:50.680
 where that was the death of a sentient being and Hal knew it.

1:57:50.680 --> 1:58:02.680
 So I think we all kind of know that a sufficiently intelligent being is going to have some form of consciousness.

1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:07.680
 But whether it would be like biological consciousness, I just don't know.

1:58:07.680 --> 1:58:15.680
 And if you're thinking about how do we bring together, I mean, obviously we're going to interact more closely with AI.

1:58:15.680 --> 1:58:25.680
 But is a dog really like a toaster or is there really some kind of difference there?

1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:32.680
 You were talking about biochemistry is algorithmic, but it's not single algorithm and it's very complex, of course it is.

1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:36.680
 So it may be that there are again conflicts in the circuits of biochemistry,

1:58:36.680 --> 1:58:51.680
 but I have a feeling that the level of complexity of the total biochemical system at the level of a single cell is less complex than the level of neural networking in the human brain or in an AI.

1:58:51.680 --> 1:58:58.680
 Well, I guess I assumed that we were including the brain in the biochemistry algorithm because you have to...

1:58:58.680 --> 1:59:02.680
 I would see that as a higher level of organization of neural networks.

1:59:02.680 --> 1:59:05.680
 They're all using the same biochemical wiring within themselves.

1:59:05.680 --> 1:59:13.680
 Yeah, but the human brain is not just neurons, it's the immune system, it's the whole package.

1:59:13.680 --> 1:59:21.680
 I mean, to have a biochemical algorithm that runs an intelligent biological system, you have to include the whole damn thing.

1:59:21.680 --> 1:59:26.680
 And it's pretty fascinating that it comes from an embryo.

1:59:26.680 --> 1:59:36.680
 I mean, oh boy, I mean, what is a human being? Because it's just some code and then you build.

1:59:36.680 --> 1:59:41.680
 So it's DNA doesn't just tell you what to build but how to build it.

1:59:41.680 --> 1:59:51.680
 I mean, the thing is impressive and the question is how difficult is it to reverse engineer the whole shebang?

1:59:51.680 --> 1:59:53.680
 Very difficult.

1:59:53.680 --> 1:59:58.680
 I would say it's...

1:59:58.680 --> 2:00:06.680
 I don't want to say impossible, but it's much easier to build a human than to reverse engineer...

2:00:06.680 --> 2:00:15.680
 to build like a fake human, human like thing than to reverse engineer the entirety of the process of evolution.

2:00:15.680 --> 2:00:20.680
 I'm not sure if we are capable of reverse engineering the whole thing.

2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:23.680
 If the human mind is capable of doing that.

2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:30.680
 I mean, I wouldn't be a biologist if I wasn't trying, but I know I can't understand the whole problem.

2:00:30.680 --> 2:00:34.680
 I'm just trying to understand the rudimentary outlines of the problem.

2:00:34.680 --> 2:00:40.680
 There's another aspect, though, you're talking about developing from a single cell to the human mind

2:00:40.680 --> 2:00:48.680
 and all the subsystems that are part of the immune system and so on.

2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:54.680
 This is something that you'll talk about, I imagine, with Michael Levin.

2:00:54.680 --> 2:01:00.680
 But so little is known about...

2:01:00.680 --> 2:01:05.680
 You talk about reverse engineers, so little is known about the developmental pathways that go from a genome

2:01:05.680 --> 2:01:08.680
 to going to a fully wired organism.

2:01:08.680 --> 2:01:14.680
 And a lot of it seems to depend on the same intellectual interactions

2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:19.680
 that I was talking about happening at the level of single cells and its interaction with the environment.

2:01:19.680 --> 2:01:26.680
 There's a whole electrical field side to biology that is not yet written into any of the textbooks,

2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:32.680
 which is about how does an embryo develop into or a single cell develop into these complex systems,

2:01:32.680 --> 2:01:36.680
 what defines the head, what defines the immune system, what defines the brain and so on.

2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:40.680
 That really is written in a language that we're only just beginning to understand,

2:01:40.680 --> 2:01:47.680
 particularly biologists, most biologists are still very reluctant to even get themselves tangled up

2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:51.680
 in questions like electrical fields influencing development.

2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:57.680
 It seems like mumbo jumbo to a lot of biologists, and it should not be because this is the 21st century biology.

2:01:57.680 --> 2:01:59.680
 This is where it's going.

2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:04.680
 But we're not going to reverse engineer a human being or the mind or any of these subsystems

2:02:04.680 --> 2:02:09.680
 until we understand how this developmental process is, how electricity in biology really works.

2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:15.680
 And if it is linked with feelings and with consciousness and so on,

2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:18.680
 in the meantime, we have to try.

2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:22.680
 But I think that's where the answer lies.

2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:31.680
 So you think it's possible that the key to things like consciousness are some of the more tricky aspects of cognition

2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:38.680
 might lie in that early development, the interaction of electricity and biology.

2:02:38.680 --> 2:02:40.680
 Electrical fields.

2:02:40.680 --> 2:02:44.680
 But we already know the EEG and so on is telling us a lot about brain function,

2:02:44.680 --> 2:02:48.680
 but we don't know which cells, which parts of a neural network is giving rise to the EEG.

2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:50.680
 We don't know the basics.

2:02:50.680 --> 2:02:54.680
 The assumption is, I mean, we know it's neural networks, we know it's multiple cells,

2:02:54.680 --> 2:02:56.680
 hundreds or thousands of cells involved in it,

2:02:56.680 --> 2:03:02.680
 and we assume that it's to do with depolarization during action potentials and so on.

2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:08.680
 But the mitochondria which are in there have much more membranes than the plasma membrane of the neuron

2:03:08.680 --> 2:03:10.680
 and there's a much greater membrane potential.

2:03:10.680 --> 2:03:14.680
 And it's formed in parallel, very often parallel Christi,

2:03:14.680 --> 2:03:20.680
 which are capable of reinforcing a field and generating fields over longer distances.

2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:24.680
 And nobody knows if that plays a role in consciousness or not.

2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:28.680
 There's reasons to argue that it could, but frankly, we simply do not know.

2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:30.680
 And it's not taken into consideration.

2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:34.680
 You look at the structure of the mitochondrial membranes

2:03:34.680 --> 2:03:39.680
 in the brains of simple things like josophila, the fruit fly,

2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:41.680
 and they have amazing structures.

2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:47.680
 You can see lots of little rectangular things all lined up in amazing patterns.

2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:48.680
 What are they doing?

2:03:48.680 --> 2:03:49.680
 Why are they like that?

2:03:49.680 --> 2:03:51.680
 We haven't the first clue.

2:03:51.680 --> 2:03:54.680
 What do you think about organoids and brain organoids?

2:03:54.680 --> 2:04:04.680
 So in a lab trying to study the development of these in the Petru dish development of organs,

2:04:04.680 --> 2:04:05.680
 do you think that's promising?

2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:07.680
 Do you have to look at the whole systems?

2:04:07.680 --> 2:04:09.680
 I've never done anything like that.

2:04:09.680 --> 2:04:10.680
 I don't know much about it.

2:04:10.680 --> 2:04:14.680
 The people who I've talked to who do work on it say amazing things can happen

2:04:14.680 --> 2:04:20.680
 and a bit of a brain drone in a dish is capable of experiencing some kind of feelings

2:04:20.680 --> 2:04:23.680
 or even memories of its former brain.

2:04:23.680 --> 2:04:29.680
 Again, I have a feeling that until we understand how to control the electrical fields

2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:35.680
 that control development, we're not going to understand how to turn an organoid into a real functional system.

2:04:35.680 --> 2:04:38.680
 But how do we get that understanding?

2:04:38.680 --> 2:04:41.680
 It's so incredibly difficult.

2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:44.680
 I mean, you would have to, I mean, one promising direction.

2:04:44.680 --> 2:04:46.680
 I'd love to get your opinion on this.

2:04:46.680 --> 2:04:51.680
 I don't know if you're familiar with the work of DeepMind and AlphaFold with protein folding and so on.

2:04:51.680 --> 2:04:57.680
 Do you think it's possible that that will give us some breakthroughs in biology

2:04:57.680 --> 2:05:06.680
 trying to basically simulate and model the behavior of trivial biological systems

2:05:06.680 --> 2:05:10.680
 as they become complex biological systems?

2:05:10.680 --> 2:05:12.680
 I'm sorry, Will.

2:05:12.680 --> 2:05:18.680
 The interesting thing to me about protein folding is that for a long time,

2:05:18.680 --> 2:05:21.680
 my understanding, this is not what I work on, so I may have got this wrong,

2:05:21.680 --> 2:05:28.680
 but my understanding is that you take the sequence of a protein and you try to fold it.

2:05:28.680 --> 2:05:30.680
 And there are multiple ways in which it can fold.

2:05:30.680 --> 2:05:34.680
 And to come up with the correct confirmation is not a very easy thing

2:05:34.680 --> 2:05:37.680
 because you're doing it from first principles from a string of letters

2:05:37.680 --> 2:05:39.680
 which specify the string of amino acids.

2:05:39.680 --> 2:05:45.680
 But what actually happens is when a protein is coming out of a ribosome,

2:05:45.680 --> 2:05:49.680
 it's coming out of a charged tunnel and it's in a very specific environment

2:05:49.680 --> 2:05:52.680
 which is going to force this to go there now and then this one to go there

2:05:52.680 --> 2:05:53.680
 and this one to come like that.

2:05:53.680 --> 2:05:56.680
 And so you're forcing a specific conformational set of changes onto it

2:05:56.680 --> 2:05:58.680
 as it comes out of the ribosome.

2:05:58.680 --> 2:06:01.680
 So by the time it's fully emerged, it's already got its shape

2:06:01.680 --> 2:06:07.680
 and that shape depended on the immediate environment that it was emerging into

2:06:07.680 --> 2:06:11.680
 one letter, one amino acid at a time.

2:06:11.680 --> 2:06:16.680
 And I don't think that the field was looking at it that way.

2:06:16.680 --> 2:06:20.680
 And if that's correct, then that's very characteristic of science

2:06:20.680 --> 2:06:22.680
 which is to say it asks very often the wrong question

2:06:22.680 --> 2:06:25.680
 and then does really amazingly sophisticated analyses on something

2:06:25.680 --> 2:06:27.680
 having never thought to actually think,

2:06:27.680 --> 2:06:28.680
 well, what is biology doing?

2:06:28.680 --> 2:06:31.680
 And biology is giving you a charged electrical environment

2:06:31.680 --> 2:06:32.680
 that forces you to be this way.

2:06:32.680 --> 2:06:39.680
 Now, did deep mind come up through patterns with some answer that was like that?

2:06:39.680 --> 2:06:41.680
 I've got absolutely no idea.

2:06:41.680 --> 2:06:46.680
 It ought to be possible to deduce that from the shapes of proteins.

2:06:46.680 --> 2:06:52.680
 It would require much greater skill than the human mind has.

2:06:52.680 --> 2:06:54.680
 But the human mind is capable of saying,

2:06:54.680 --> 2:06:56.680
 well, hang on, let's look at this exit tunnel

2:06:56.680 --> 2:06:58.680
 and try and work out what shape is this protein going to take

2:06:58.680 --> 2:06:59.680
 and we can figure that out.

2:06:59.680 --> 2:07:01.680
 That's really interesting about the exit tunnel.

2:07:01.680 --> 2:07:06.680
 But sometimes we get lucky and just like in science,

2:07:06.680 --> 2:07:11.680
 the simplified view or the static view will actually solve the problem for us.

2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:15.680
 So in this case, it's very possible that the sequence of letters

2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:21.680
 has a unique mapping to our structure without considering how it unraveled.

2:07:21.680 --> 2:07:23.680
 So without considering the tunnel.

2:07:23.680 --> 2:07:27.680
 And so that seems to be the case in this situation

2:07:27.680 --> 2:07:29.680
 where the cool thing about proteins,

2:07:29.680 --> 2:07:31.680
 all the different shapes they can possibly take,

2:07:31.680 --> 2:07:35.680
 it actually seems to take very specific unique shapes given the sequence.

2:07:35.680 --> 2:07:37.680
 That's forced on you by an exit tunnel.

2:07:37.680 --> 2:07:39.680
 So the problem is actually much simpler than you thought.

2:07:39.680 --> 2:07:43.680
 And then there's a whole army of proteins

2:07:43.680 --> 2:07:48.680
 which change the conformational state, chaperone proteins.

2:07:48.680 --> 2:07:52.680
 And they're only used when there's some,

2:07:52.680 --> 2:07:55.680
 presumably, issue with how it came out of the exit tunnel

2:07:55.680 --> 2:07:57.680
 and you want to do it differently to that.

2:07:57.680 --> 2:07:59.680
 So very often the chaperone proteins will go there

2:07:59.680 --> 2:08:02.680
 and will influence the way in which it falls.

2:08:02.680 --> 2:08:06.680
 So there's two ways of doing it.

2:08:06.680 --> 2:08:10.680
 Either you can look at the structures and the sequences of all the proteins

2:08:10.680 --> 2:08:12.680
 and you can apply an immense mind to it

2:08:12.680 --> 2:08:15.680
 and figure out what the patterns are and figure out what how,

2:08:15.680 --> 2:08:17.680
 or you can look at the actual situation where it is and say,

2:08:17.680 --> 2:08:19.680
 well, hang on, it was actually quite simple.

2:08:19.680 --> 2:08:22.680
 It's got a charged environment and it's forced to come out this way.

2:08:22.680 --> 2:08:23.680
 And then the question will be,

2:08:23.680 --> 2:08:26.680
 well, do different ribosomes have different charged environments

2:08:26.680 --> 2:08:28.680
 for what happens if a chaperone, you know,

2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:31.680
 you're asking a different set of questions to come to the same answer

2:08:31.680 --> 2:08:34.680
 in a way which is telling you a much simpler story

2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:35.680
 and explains why it is.

2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:37.680
 Rather than saying it could be,

2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:41.680
 this is one in a billion different possible conformational states

2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:42.680
 that this protein could have,

2:08:42.680 --> 2:08:45.680
 you're saying, well, it has this one because that was the only one

2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:47.680
 it could take given its setting.

2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:49.680
 Well, yeah, I mean,

2:08:49.680 --> 2:08:52.680
 currently humans are very good at that kind of first principles thinking.

2:08:52.680 --> 2:08:54.680
 I was stepping back.

2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:56.680
 But I think AI is really good at, you know,

2:08:56.680 --> 2:08:58.680
 collecting a huge amount of data

2:08:58.680 --> 2:09:01.680
 and a huge amount of data of observation of planets

2:09:01.680 --> 2:09:04.680
 and figure out that Earth is not at the center of the universe,

2:09:04.680 --> 2:09:07.680
 that there's actually a sun orbiting the sun.

2:09:07.680 --> 2:09:09.680
 But then you can, as a human being, ask,

2:09:09.680 --> 2:09:12.680
 well, how did solar systems come to be?

2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:16.680
 What are the different forces that are required

2:09:16.680 --> 2:09:19.680
 to make this kind of pattern emerge?

2:09:19.680 --> 2:09:22.680
 And then you start to invent things like gravity.

2:09:22.680 --> 2:09:25.680
 I mean, obviously,

2:09:25.680 --> 2:09:29.680
 I mixed up the ordering of gravity,

2:09:29.680 --> 2:09:32.680
 wasn't considered as a thing that connects planets,

2:09:32.680 --> 2:09:37.680
 but we are able to think about those big picture things as human beings.

2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:41.680
 AI is just very good to infer simple models

2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:44.680
 from a huge amount of data.

2:09:44.680 --> 2:09:47.680
 And the question is with biology,

2:09:47.680 --> 2:09:50.680
 we kind of go back and forth to how we solve biology.

2:09:50.680 --> 2:09:54.680
 Listen, protein folding was thought to be impossible to solve.

2:09:54.680 --> 2:09:56.680
 And there's a lot of brilliant PhD students

2:09:56.680 --> 2:10:00.680
 that worked one protein at a time trying to figure out the structure.

2:10:00.680 --> 2:10:02.680
 And in fact, I was able to do that.

2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:05.680
 Oh, I'm not knocking it at all,

2:10:05.680 --> 2:10:09.680
 but I think that people have been asking the wrong question.

2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:16.680
 But then as the people start to ask better and bigger questions,

2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:20.680
 the AI kind of enters the chat and says,

2:10:20.680 --> 2:10:22.680
 I'll help you out with that.

2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:26.680
 Can I give you another example of my own work?

2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:31.680
 The risk of getting a disease as we get older,

2:10:31.680 --> 2:10:34.680
 there are genetic aspects to it.

2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:38.680
 If you spend your whole life overeating and smoking and whatever,

2:10:38.680 --> 2:10:41.680
 that's a whole separate question.

2:10:41.680 --> 2:10:43.680
 But there's a genetic side to the risk.

2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:47.680
 And we know a few genes that increase your risk of certain things.

2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:49.680
 And for probably 20 years now,

2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:54.680
 people have been doing what's called GWAS, which is genome wide association studies.

2:10:54.680 --> 2:10:58.680
 So you've effectively scanned the entire genome

2:10:58.680 --> 2:11:01.680
 for any single nucleotide polymorphisms,

2:11:01.680 --> 2:11:04.680
 which is, say, a single letter change in one place

2:11:04.680 --> 2:11:08.680
 that has a higher association of being linked with a particular disease or not.

2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:11.680
 And you can come out with thousands of these things across the genome.

2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:16.680
 And if you add them all up and try and say,

2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:23.680
 well, so do they add up to explain the known genetic risk of this disease?

2:11:23.680 --> 2:11:25.680
 And the known genetic risk often comes from twin studies.

2:11:25.680 --> 2:11:30.680
 And you can say that if this twin gets epilepsy,

2:11:30.680 --> 2:11:35.680
 there's a 40 or 50% risk that the other twin, identical twin, will also get epilepsy.

2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:38.680
 Therefore, the genetic factor is about 50%.

2:11:38.680 --> 2:11:45.680
 And so the gene similarities that you see should account for 50% of that known risk.

2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:49.680
 Very often it accounts for less than a tenth of the known risk.

2:11:49.680 --> 2:11:52.680
 And there's two possible explanations.

2:11:52.680 --> 2:11:54.680
 And there's one which people tend to do, which is to say,

2:11:54.680 --> 2:11:57.680
 ah, well, we don't have enough statistical power.

2:11:57.680 --> 2:12:01.680
 If we, maybe there's a million, we've only found a thousand of them.

2:12:01.680 --> 2:12:03.680
 But if we find the other million, they're weekly related,

2:12:03.680 --> 2:12:04.680
 but there's a huge number of them.

2:12:04.680 --> 2:12:06.680
 And so we'll account for that whole risk.

2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:10.680
 Maybe there's a billion of them.

2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:12.680
 So that's one way.

2:12:12.680 --> 2:12:15.680
 The other way is to say, well, hang on a minute.

2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:16.680
 You're missing a system here.

2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:18.680
 That system is the mitochondrial DNA,

2:12:18.680 --> 2:12:22.680
 which people tend to dismiss because it's small and it's not.

2:12:22.680 --> 2:12:26.680
 It doesn't change very much.

2:12:26.680 --> 2:12:30.680
 But a few single letter changes in that mitochondrial DNA,

2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:33.680
 it controls some really basic processes.

2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:37.680
 It controls not only all the energy that we need to live

2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:39.680
 and to move around and do everything we do,

2:12:39.680 --> 2:12:44.680
 but also biosynthesis to make the new building blocks

2:12:44.680 --> 2:12:47.680
 to make new cells.

2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:50.680
 And cancer cells very often kind of take over the mitochondria

2:12:50.680 --> 2:12:54.680
 and rewire them so that instead of using them for making energy,

2:12:54.680 --> 2:12:56.680
 they're effectively using them as precursors

2:12:56.680 --> 2:12:58.680
 for the building blocks for biosynthesis.

2:12:58.680 --> 2:13:01.680
 You need to make new amino acids, new nucleotides for DNA.

2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:04.680
 You want to make new lipids to make your membranes and so on.

2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:06.680
 So they kind of rewire metabolism.

2:13:06.680 --> 2:13:09.680
 Now, the problem is that we've got all these interactions

2:13:09.680 --> 2:13:12.680
 between mitochondrial DNA and the genes in the nucleus

2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:16.680
 that are overlooked completely because people throw away,

2:13:16.680 --> 2:13:18.680
 literally throw away the mitochondrial genes.

2:13:18.680 --> 2:13:20.680
 And we can see in fruit flies that they interact

2:13:20.680 --> 2:13:23.680
 and produce big differences in risk.

2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:28.680
 So you can set, you can set AI onto this question

2:13:28.680 --> 2:13:34.680
 of exactly what, you know, how many of these base changes there are.

2:13:34.680 --> 2:13:36.680
 And that's just one possible solution

2:13:36.680 --> 2:13:38.680
 that maybe there are a million of them

2:13:38.680 --> 2:13:40.680
 and it does account for the greatest part of the risk.

2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:42.680
 Well, the other one is they aren't.

2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:43.680
 It's just not there.

2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:46.680
 Actually, the risk lies in something you weren't even looking at.

2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:50.680
 And this is where human intuition is very important

2:13:50.680 --> 2:13:52.680
 and just this feeling that, well, I'm working on this

2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:55.680
 and I think it's important and I'm bloody minded about it

2:13:55.680 --> 2:13:57.680
 and in the end, some people are right.

2:13:57.680 --> 2:13:59.680
 It turns out that it was important.

2:13:59.680 --> 2:14:02.680
 Can you get AI to do that, to be bloody minded?

2:14:02.680 --> 2:14:06.680
 And that hang on a minute.

2:14:06.680 --> 2:14:10.680
 You might be missing a whole other system here that's much bigger.

2:14:10.680 --> 2:14:16.680
 That's the moment of discovery of scientific revolution.

2:14:16.680 --> 2:14:21.680
 I'm giving up on saying AI can't do something.

2:14:21.680 --> 2:14:24.680
 I've said enough times about enough things.

2:14:24.680 --> 2:14:26.680
 I think there's been a lot of progress.

2:14:26.680 --> 2:14:31.680
 And instead, I'm excited by the possibility of AI helping humans.

2:14:31.680 --> 2:14:33.680
 At the same time, just like I said,

2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:36.680
 we seem to dismiss the power of humans.

2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:37.680
 Yes.

2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:44.680
 We're so limited in so many ways that we kind of,

2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:50.680
 in what we feel like dumb ways, we're not strong.

2:14:50.680 --> 2:14:56.680
 We're kind of, our attention, our memory is limited.

2:14:56.680 --> 2:14:59.680
 Our ability to focus on things is limited.

2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:02.680
 In our own perception of what limited is.

2:15:02.680 --> 2:15:06.680
 But that actually, there's an incredible computer behind the whole thing

2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:08.680
 that makes this whole system work.

2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:11.680
 Our ability to interact with the environment,

2:15:11.680 --> 2:15:12.680
 to reason about the environment.

2:15:12.680 --> 2:15:14.680
 There's magic there.

2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:18.680
 And I'm hopeful that AI can capture some of that same magic.

2:15:18.680 --> 2:15:22.680
 But that magic is not going to look like deep blue playing chess.

2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:24.680
 It's going to be more interesting.

2:15:24.680 --> 2:15:27.680
 But I don't think it's going to look like pattern finding either.

2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:29.680
 I mean, that's essentially what you're telling me.

2:15:29.680 --> 2:15:30.680
 It does very well at the moment.

2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:35.680
 And my point is, it works very well where you're looking for the right pattern.

2:15:35.680 --> 2:15:38.680
 But we are storytelling animals.

2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:40.680
 And the hypothesis is a story.

2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:42.680
 It's a testable story.

2:15:42.680 --> 2:15:46.680
 But a new hypothesis is a leap into the unknown.

2:15:46.680 --> 2:15:48.680
 And it's a new story, basically.

2:15:48.680 --> 2:15:50.680
 And it says, this leads to this leads to that.

2:15:50.680 --> 2:15:54.680
 It's a causal set of storytelling.

2:15:54.680 --> 2:15:58.680
 It's also possible that the leap into the unknown has a pattern of its own.

2:15:58.680 --> 2:15:59.680
 Yes, it is.

2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:01.680
 And it's possible that's learnable.

2:16:01.680 --> 2:16:03.680
 I'm sure it is.

2:16:03.680 --> 2:16:10.680
 There's a nice book by Arthur Kustler on the nature of creativity.

2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:15.680
 And he likens it to a joke where the punchline goes off in a completely unexpected direction

2:16:15.680 --> 2:16:18.680
 and says that this is the basis of human creativity.

2:16:18.680 --> 2:16:24.680
 Some creative switch of direction to an unexpected place is similar to a joke.

2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:26.680
 I'm not saying that's how it works.

2:16:26.680 --> 2:16:30.680
 But it's a nice idea and there must be some truth in it.

2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:34.680
 And it's one of these, most of the stories we tell are probably the wrong story

2:16:34.680 --> 2:16:37.680
 and probably going nowhere and probably not helpful.

2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:41.680
 And we definitely don't do as well at seeing patterns in things.

2:16:41.680 --> 2:16:45.680
 But some of the most enjoyable human aspects is finding a new story

2:16:45.680 --> 2:16:47.680
 that goes to an unexpected place.

2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:51.680
 And these are all aspects of what being human means to me.

2:16:51.680 --> 2:16:55.680
 And maybe these are all things that AI figures out for itself

2:16:55.680 --> 2:16:57.680
 or maybe they're just aspects.

2:16:57.680 --> 2:17:04.680
 But I just have the feeling sometimes that the people who are trying to understand

2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:12.680
 what we are like, if we wish to craft an AI system which is somehow human like

2:17:12.680 --> 2:17:18.680
 that we don't have a firm enough grasp of what humans really are like

2:17:18.680 --> 2:17:20.680
 in terms of how we are built.

2:17:20.680 --> 2:17:24.680
 But we get a better, better understanding of that.

2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:26.680
 I agree with you completely.

2:17:26.680 --> 2:17:30.680
 We try to build a thing and then we go, hang on in a minute.

2:17:30.680 --> 2:17:35.680
 There's another system here and that's actually the attempt to build AI

2:17:35.680 --> 2:17:39.680
 that's human like is getting us to a deeper understanding of human beings.

2:17:39.680 --> 2:17:42.680
 The funny thing that I recently talked to Magnus Carlson,

2:17:42.680 --> 2:17:45.680
 why they consider to be the greatest chess player of all time.

2:17:45.680 --> 2:17:51.680
 And he talked about AlphaZero, which is a system from DeepMind that plays chess.

2:17:51.680 --> 2:17:53.680
 And he had a funny comment.

2:17:53.680 --> 2:17:57.680
 He has a kind of dry sense of humor.

2:17:57.680 --> 2:18:01.680
 But he was extremely impressed when he first saw AlphaZero play.

2:18:01.680 --> 2:18:07.680
 And he said that it did a lot of things that could easily be mistaken for creativity.

2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:16.680
 So he like, as a typical human, refused to give the system sort of its due.

2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:22.680
 Because he came up with a lot of things that a lot of people are extremely impressed by.

2:18:22.680 --> 2:18:26.680
 Not just the sheer calculation, but the brilliance of play.

2:18:26.680 --> 2:18:34.680
 So one of the things that it does in really interesting ways is it sacrifices pieces.

2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:40.680
 So in chess, that means you basically take a few steps back and it takes a step forward.

2:18:40.680 --> 2:18:44.680
 You give away pieces for some future reward.

2:18:44.680 --> 2:18:49.680
 And that for us humans is where art is in chess.

2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:57.680
 You take big risks that for us humans, those risks are especially painful

2:18:57.680 --> 2:19:01.680
 because you have a fog of uncertainty before you.

2:19:01.680 --> 2:19:06.680
 So to take a risk now based on intuition, if I think this is the right risk to take,

2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:10.680
 but there's so many possibilities that that's where it takes guts.

2:19:10.680 --> 2:19:13.680
 That's where art is. That's that danger.

2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:21.680
 And then AlphaZero takes those same kind of risks and does them even greater degree.

2:19:21.680 --> 2:19:33.680
 But of course, it does it from what you could easily reduce down to a cold calculation over patterns.

2:19:33.680 --> 2:19:41.680
 But boy, when you see the final result, it sure looks like the same kind of magic that we see in creativity.

2:19:41.680 --> 2:19:46.680
 We see creative play on the chessboard, but the chessboard is very limited.

2:19:46.680 --> 2:19:55.680
 And the question is, as we get better and better, can we do that same kind of creativity in mathematics, in programming,

2:19:55.680 --> 2:20:03.680
 and then venturing biology, psychology, and expand into more and more complex systems?

2:20:03.680 --> 2:20:10.680
 I used to go running when I was a boy and fell running, which is say running up and down mountains.

2:20:10.680 --> 2:20:18.680
 And I was never particularly great at it, but there were some people who were amazingly fast, especially at running down.

2:20:18.680 --> 2:20:24.680
 And I realized in trying to do this, that there's only really two ways.

2:20:24.680 --> 2:20:27.680
 There are three possible ways of doing it, and there's only two that work.

2:20:27.680 --> 2:20:32.680
 Either you go extremely slowly and carefully, and you figure out, OK, there's a stone.

2:20:32.680 --> 2:20:37.680
 I'll put my foot on this stone, and then there's another, there's a muddy puddle I'm going to avoid.

2:20:37.680 --> 2:20:41.680
 It's slow, it's laborious. You figure it out step by step.

2:20:41.680 --> 2:20:45.680
 Or you can just go incredibly fast, and you don't think about it at all.

2:20:45.680 --> 2:20:49.680
 The entire conscious mind is shut out of it, and it's probably the same, playing table tennis or something.

2:20:49.680 --> 2:20:55.680
 There's something in the mind which is doing a whole lot of subconscious calculations about it, and it's amazing.

2:20:55.680 --> 2:20:59.680
 You can run at an astonishing speed down a hillside with no idea how you did it at all.

2:20:59.680 --> 2:21:03.680
 And then you panic, and you think, I'm going to break my leg if I keep doing this.

2:21:03.680 --> 2:21:07.680
 I've got to think about where I'm going to put my foot. So you slow down a bit and try to bring those conscious mind in,

2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:13.680
 and then you do, you crash, you cannot think consciously while running downhill.

2:21:13.680 --> 2:21:20.680
 So it's amazing how many calculations the mind is able to make.

2:21:20.680 --> 2:21:27.680
 Now, the problem with playing chess or something, if you were able to make all of those subconscious kind of forward calculations

2:21:27.680 --> 2:21:34.680
 about what is the likely outcome of this move now in the way that we can by running down a hillside or something.

2:21:34.680 --> 2:21:40.680
 It's partly about what we have adapted to do. It's partly about the reality of the world that we're in.

2:21:40.680 --> 2:21:45.680
 Running fast downhill is something that we better be bloody good at, otherwise we're going to be eaten.

2:21:45.680 --> 2:21:53.680
 Whereas trying to calculate multiple, multiple moves into the future is not something we've ever been called on to do.

2:21:53.680 --> 2:21:59.680
 Two or three, four moves into the future is quite enough for most of us most of the time.

2:21:59.680 --> 2:22:16.680
 Yeah, yeah. So just solving chess may not, we may not be as far towards solving the problem of downhill running as we might think just because we solve chess.

2:22:16.680 --> 2:22:28.680
 Still, it's beautiful to see creativity. Humans create machines that are able to create art and art on the chess board and art otherwise.

2:22:28.680 --> 2:22:31.680
 Who knows how far that takes us.

2:22:31.680 --> 2:22:36.680
 So I mentioned Andre Carpathi earlier. Him and I are big fans of yours.

2:22:36.680 --> 2:22:42.680
 If you're taking votes, his suggestion was you should write your next book on the Fermi Paradox.

2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:48.680
 So let me ask you on the topic of alien life.

2:22:48.680 --> 2:22:52.680
 Since we've been talking about life and we're a kind of aliens.

2:22:52.680 --> 2:22:57.680
 How many alien civilizations are out there? Do you think?

2:22:57.680 --> 2:23:16.680
 Well, the universe is very big, so some, but not as many as most people would like to think is my view because the idea that there is a trajectory going from simple cellular life like bacteria all the way through to humans.

2:23:16.680 --> 2:23:26.680
 It seems to me there's some big gaps along that way that the eukaryotic cell, the complex cell that we have is the biggest of them, but also photosynthesis is another.

2:23:26.680 --> 2:23:38.680
 Another interesting gap is a long gap from the origin of the eukaryotic cell to the first animals. That was about a billion years, maybe more than that.

2:23:38.680 --> 2:23:42.680
 A long delay in where oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere.

2:23:42.680 --> 2:23:51.680
 So from the first appearance of oxygen in the Great Oxidation Event to enough for animals to respire, it was close to two billion years.

2:23:51.680 --> 2:24:00.680
 Why so long? It seems to be planetary factors. It seems to be geology as much as anything else, and we don't really know what was going on.

2:24:00.680 --> 2:24:11.680
 So the idea that there's a kind of an inevitable march towards complexity and sentient life, I don't think is right.

2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:17.680
 It doesn't, not to say it's not going to happen, but I think it's not going to happen often.

2:24:17.680 --> 2:24:31.680
 So if you think of Earth, given the geological constraints and all that kind of stuff, do you have a sense that life, complex life, intelligent life happen really quickly on Earth or really long?

2:24:31.680 --> 2:24:46.680
 So just to get a sense of, are you more sort of saying that it's very unlikely to get the kind of conditions required to create humans, or is it even if you have the condition it's just statistically difficult?

2:24:46.680 --> 2:24:56.680
 I think the single great problem at the center of all of that, to my mind, is the origin of the eukaryotic cell, which happened once and without eukaryotes, nothing else would have happened.

2:24:56.680 --> 2:24:58.680
 And that is something that...

2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:02.680
 That's because you're saying it's super important, the eukaryotes, but...

2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:08.680
 I'm saying tantamount to saying that it is impossible to build something as complex as a human being from bacterial cells.

2:25:08.680 --> 2:25:17.680
 Totally agree in some deep fundamental way, but it's just like a one cell going inside another. Is that so difficult to get to work right?

2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:24.680
 Well, again, it happened once, and if you think about...

2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:33.680
 I'm in a minority view in this position, most biologists probably wouldn't agree with me anyway, but if you think about the starting point, we've got a simple cell.

2:25:33.680 --> 2:25:41.680
 It's an archaeal cell, we can be fairly sure about that, so it looks a lot like a bacterium, but it's in fact from this other domain of life.

2:25:41.680 --> 2:25:49.680
 So it looks a lot like a bacterial cell, that means it doesn't have anything, it doesn't have a nucleus, it doesn't really have complex endomembrane.

2:25:49.680 --> 2:25:52.680
 It has a little bit of stuff, but not that much.

2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:55.680
 And it takes up an endosymbiont.

2:25:55.680 --> 2:25:57.680
 So what happens next?

2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:01.680
 And the answer is basically everything to do with complexity.

2:26:01.680 --> 2:26:05.680
 To me, there's a beautiful paradox here.

2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:15.680
 Plants and animals and fungi all have exactly the same type of cell, but they all have really different ways of living.

2:26:15.680 --> 2:26:23.680
 So a plant cell is photosynthetic, they started out as algae in the oceans and so on.

2:26:23.680 --> 2:26:34.680
 So think of algal, blooms, single cell things, the basic cell structure that it's built from is exactly the same with a couple of small differences.

2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:38.680
 It's got chloroplasts as well, it's got a vacuole, it's got a cell wall, but that's about it.

2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:42.680
 Pretty much everything else is exactly the same in a plant cell and an animal cell.

2:26:42.680 --> 2:26:45.680
 And yet the ways of life are completely different.

2:26:45.680 --> 2:26:54.680
 So this cell structure did not evolve in response to different ways of life, different environments.

2:26:54.680 --> 2:26:58.680
 I'm in the ocean doing photosynthesis, I'm on land running around as part of an animal, I'm a fungus in a soil,

2:26:58.680 --> 2:27:03.680
 spending out long kind of shoots into whatever it may be, mycelium.

2:27:03.680 --> 2:27:06.680
 So they all have the same underlying cell structure.

2:27:06.680 --> 2:27:17.680
 Why? Almost certainly it was driven by adaptation to the internal environment, to having these pesky endosymbionts that forced all kinds of change on the host cell.

2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:22.680
 Now in one way you could see that as a really good thing, because it may be that there's some inevitability to this process,

2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:25.680
 that as soon as you've got endosymbionts you're more or less bound to go in that direction,

2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:32.680
 or it could be that there's a huge fluke about it and it's almost certain to go wrong in just about every case possible,

2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:38.680
 that the conflict will lead to effectively war leading to death and extinction and it simply doesn't work out.

2:27:38.680 --> 2:27:45.680
 So maybe it happened millions of times and it went wrong every time, or maybe it only happened once and it worked out because it was inevitable.

2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:51.680
 And actually we simply do not know enough now to say which of those two possibilities is true, but both of them are a bit grim.

2:27:51.680 --> 2:27:58.680
 But you're leaning towards, we just got really lucky in that one leap.

2:27:58.680 --> 2:28:07.680
 So do you have a sense that our galaxy, for example, has just maybe millions of planets with bacteria living on it?

2:28:07.680 --> 2:28:12.680
 I would expect billions, tens of billions of planets with bacteria living on it practically.

2:28:12.680 --> 2:28:20.680
 I mean there's probably five to ten planets per star of which I would hope that at least one would have bacteria on.

2:28:20.680 --> 2:28:23.680
 So I expect bacteria to be very common.

2:28:23.680 --> 2:28:28.680
 I simply can't put a number otherwise, I mean I expect it will happen elsewhere.

2:28:28.680 --> 2:28:36.680
 It's not that I think we're living in a completely empty universe, but I think that it's not going to happen inevitably and there's something,

2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:43.680
 that's not the only problem with complex life on Earth, I mentioned, and animals and so on as well.

2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:45.680
 And even humans, we came along very late.

2:28:45.680 --> 2:28:51.680
 You go back five million years and would we be that impressed if we came across a planet full of giraffes?

2:28:51.680 --> 2:28:55.680
 I mean, you'd think, hey, there's life here and there's a nice planet to colonize or something.

2:28:55.680 --> 2:28:59.680
 We wouldn't think, oh, let's try and have a conversation with this giraffe.

2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:03.680
 Yeah, I'm not sure what exactly we would think.

2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:11.680
 I'm not exactly sure what makes humans so interesting from an alien perspective or how they would notice.

2:29:11.680 --> 2:29:17.680
 I'll talk to you about cities too because that's an interesting perspective of how to look at human civilization.

2:29:17.680 --> 2:29:23.680
 But your sense, I mean, of course you don't know, but it's an interesting world.

2:29:23.680 --> 2:29:25.680
 It's an interesting galaxy.

2:29:25.680 --> 2:29:38.680
 It's an interesting universe to live in that's just like every sun, like 90% of solar systems have bacteria in it.

2:29:38.680 --> 2:29:50.680
 Imagine that world and the galaxy maybe has just a handful, if not one, intelligent civilization.

2:29:50.680 --> 2:29:52.680
 That's a wild world.

2:29:52.680 --> 2:29:55.680
 I didn't even think about that world.

2:29:55.680 --> 2:30:03.680
 There's a kind of thought that one of the reasons it would be so exciting to find life on Mars or Titan or whatever,

2:30:03.680 --> 2:30:17.680
 is like if it's life is elsewhere, then surely, statistically, that life, no matter how unlikely you carry as multi cell organisms, sex, violence,

2:30:17.680 --> 2:30:19.680
 what else is extremely difficult?

2:30:19.680 --> 2:30:30.680
 I mean, photosynthesis is figuring out some machinery that involves the chemistry and the environment to allow the building up of complex organisms.

2:30:30.680 --> 2:30:32.680
 Surely that would arise.

2:30:32.680 --> 2:30:37.680
 But man, I don't know how I would feel about just bacteria everywhere.

2:30:37.680 --> 2:30:40.680
 Well, it would be depressing if it was true.

2:30:40.680 --> 2:30:41.680
 I suppose depressing.

2:30:41.680 --> 2:30:42.680
 I don't think that's true.

2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:46.680
 I don't know what's more depressing, bacteria everywhere, nothing everywhere.

2:30:46.680 --> 2:30:48.680
 Yes, either of them are chilling.

2:30:48.680 --> 2:30:49.680
 Yeah.

2:30:49.680 --> 2:30:56.680
 But whether it's chilling or not, I don't think should force us to change our view about whether it's real or not.

2:30:56.680 --> 2:30:57.680
 Yes.

2:30:57.680 --> 2:30:59.680
 And what I'm saying may or may not be true.

2:30:59.680 --> 2:31:02.680
 So how would you feel if we discovered life on Mars?

2:31:02.680 --> 2:31:08.680
 It sounds like you would be less excited than some others because you're like, wow.

2:31:08.680 --> 2:31:11.680
 What I would be most interested in is how similar to life on Earth it would be.

2:31:11.680 --> 2:31:25.680
 It would actually turn into quite a subtle problem because the likelihood of life having gone to and fro between Mars and the Earth is quite, I wouldn't say high, but it's not low.

2:31:25.680 --> 2:31:26.680
 It's quite feasible.

2:31:26.680 --> 2:31:33.680
 And so if we found life on Mars and it had very similar genetic code, but it was slightly different.

2:31:33.680 --> 2:31:41.680
 Most people would interpret that immediately as evidence that there'd been transit one way or the other and that it was a common origin of life on Mars or on the Earth.

2:31:41.680 --> 2:31:42.680
 And it went one way or the other way.

2:31:42.680 --> 2:31:56.680
 The other way to see that question, though, would be to say, well, actually the beginnings of life lie in deterministic chemistry and thermodynamics, starting with the most likely abundant materials, CO2 and water and wet rocky planet.

2:31:56.680 --> 2:31:59.680
 And Mars was wet and rocky at the beginning.

2:31:59.680 --> 2:32:08.680
 And we'll, I won't say inevitably, but potentially almost inevitably come up with a genetic code, which is not very far away from the genetic code that we already have.

2:32:08.680 --> 2:32:11.680
 So we see subtle differences in the genetic code.

2:32:11.680 --> 2:32:12.680
 What does it mean?

2:32:12.680 --> 2:32:14.680
 It could be very difficult to interpret.

2:32:14.680 --> 2:32:19.680
 Is it possible, do you think, to tell the difference or something that truly originated?

2:32:19.680 --> 2:32:32.680
 I think if the stereochemistry was different, we have sugars, for example, that are the L form or the D form and we have D sugars and L amino acids right across all of life.

2:32:32.680 --> 2:32:41.680
 But lipids, the bacteria have one stereoisomer and the bacteria have the other, the opposite stereoisomer.

2:32:41.680 --> 2:32:45.680
 So it's perfectly possible to use one or the other one.

2:32:45.680 --> 2:32:55.680
 And the same would almost certainly go for, and I think George Church has been trying to make life based on the opposite stereoisomer.

2:32:55.680 --> 2:32:58.680
 So it's perfectly possible to do and it will work.

2:32:58.680 --> 2:33:08.680
 And if we were to find life on Mars that was using the opposite stereoisomer, that would be unequivocal evidence that life had started independently there.

2:33:08.680 --> 2:33:17.680
 So hopefully the life we find will be on Titan and Europa or something like that, where it's less likely that we shared and it's harsher conditions.

2:33:17.680 --> 2:33:19.680
 So there's going to be weird kind of life.

2:33:19.680 --> 2:33:25.680
 I wouldn't count on that because life started in deep sea hydrothermal vents.

2:33:25.680 --> 2:33:26.680
 It's harsh.

2:33:26.680 --> 2:33:28.680
 That's pretty harsh, yeah.

2:33:28.680 --> 2:33:29.680
 So Titan is different.

2:33:29.680 --> 2:33:33.680
 Europa is probably quite similar to Earth in the sense that we're dealing with an ocean.

2:33:33.680 --> 2:33:38.680
 It's an acidic ocean there as the early Earth would have been.

2:33:38.680 --> 2:33:42.680
 And it almost certainly has hydrothermal systems, same with Enceladus.

2:33:42.680 --> 2:33:46.680
 We can tell that from these plumes coming from the surface through the ice.

2:33:46.680 --> 2:33:50.680
 We know there's a liquid ocean and we can tell roughly what the chemistry is.

2:33:50.680 --> 2:34:00.680
 For Titan, we're dealing with liquid methane and things like that. So that would really, if there really is life there, it would really have to be very, very different to anything that we know on Earth.

2:34:00.680 --> 2:34:08.680
 So the hardest leap, the hardest leap, the most important leap is from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.

2:34:08.680 --> 2:34:12.680
 What's the second if we're ranking?

2:34:12.680 --> 2:34:17.680
 You gave a lot of emphasis on photosynthesis.

2:34:17.680 --> 2:34:20.680
 Yeah, and that would be my second one, I think.

2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:24.680
 But it's not so much, I mean, photosynthesis is part of the problem.

2:34:24.680 --> 2:34:26.680
 It's a difficult thing to do.

2:34:26.680 --> 2:34:29.680
 Again, we know it happened once.

2:34:29.680 --> 2:34:32.680
 We don't know why it happened once.

2:34:32.680 --> 2:34:43.680
 But the fact that it was kind of taken on board completely by plants and algae and so on as chloroplasts,

2:34:43.680 --> 2:34:48.680
 and did very well in completely different environments and then on land and whatever else,

2:34:48.680 --> 2:34:53.680
 seems to suggest that there's no problem with exploring.

2:34:53.680 --> 2:34:59.680
 You could have a separate origin that explored this whole domain over there that the bacteria had never gone into.

2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:06.680
 So that kind of says that the reason that it only happened once is probably because it's difficult, because the wiring is difficult.

2:35:06.680 --> 2:35:13.680
 But then it happened at least 2.2 billion years ago, right before the GOE,

2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:18.680
 maybe as long as 3 billion years ago, when some people say there are whiffs of oxygen,

2:35:18.680 --> 2:35:23.680
 there's just kind of traces in the fossil in the geochemical record that say maybe there was a bit of oxygen then,

2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:25.680
 that's really disputed.

2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:32.680
 Some people say it goes all the way back 4 billion years ago and that it was the common ancestor of life on Earth was photosynthetic.

2:35:32.680 --> 2:35:40.680
 And immediately you've got groups of people who disagree over a 2 billion year period of time about when it started.

2:35:40.680 --> 2:35:47.680
 But let's take the latest date when it's unequivocal, that's 2.2 billion years ago,

2:35:47.680 --> 2:35:53.680
 through to around about the time of the Cambrian explosion when oxygen levels definitely got close to modern levels,

2:35:53.680 --> 2:35:56.680
 which was around about 550 million years ago.

2:35:56.680 --> 2:36:02.680
 So we've gone more than one and a half billion years where the Earth was in stasis,

2:36:02.680 --> 2:36:07.680
 nothing much changed, as known as the Boring Billion, in fact.

2:36:07.680 --> 2:36:14.680
 Probably stuff was, that was when Eukaryotes arose somewhere in there, but it's...

2:36:14.680 --> 2:36:20.680
 So this idea that the world is constantly changing, that we're constantly evolving, that we're moving up some ramp,

2:36:20.680 --> 2:36:32.680
 it's a very human idea, but in reality there are tipping points to a new stable equilibrium,

2:36:32.680 --> 2:36:39.680
 where the cells that are producing oxygen are precisely counterbalanced by the cells that are consuming that oxygen,

2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:44.680
 which is why it's 21% now and has been that way for hundreds of millions of years.

2:36:44.680 --> 2:36:46.680
 We have a very precise balance.

2:36:46.680 --> 2:36:51.680
 You go through a tipping point and you don't know where the next stable state's going to be,

2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:53.680
 but it can be a long way from here.

2:36:53.680 --> 2:36:58.680
 And so if we change the world with global warming, there will be a tipping point.

2:36:58.680 --> 2:37:01.680
 The question is where and when, and what's the next stable state?

2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:03.680
 It may be uninhabitable to us.

2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:06.680
 It'll be habitable to life, for sure.

2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:11.680
 But there may be something like the Permian extinction, where 95% of species go extinct.

2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:16.680
 There's a 5 to 10 million year gap and then life recovers, but without humans.

2:37:16.680 --> 2:37:19.680
 And the question statistically, well, without humans, but statistically,

2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:25.680
 does that ultimately lead to greater complexity, more interesting life, more intelligent life?

2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:30.680
 Well, after the first appearance of oxygen with the GOE, there was a tipping point,

2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:34.680
 which led to a long term stable state that was equivalent to the Black Sea today,

2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:42.680
 which is to say oxygenated at the very surface and stagnant sterile, not sterile, but sulfurous, lower down.

2:37:42.680 --> 2:37:49.680
 And that was stable certainly around the continental margins for more than a billion years.

2:37:49.680 --> 2:37:54.680
 It was not a state that led to progression in an obvious way.

2:37:54.680 --> 2:38:00.680
 Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to think about evolution, like what leads to stable states

2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:10.680
 and how often are evolutionary pressures emerging from the environment?

2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:16.680
 So maybe other planets are able to create evolutionary pressures, chemical pressures, whatever.

2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:23.680
 Some kind of pressure that say, you're screwed unless you get your shit together in the next, like, 10,000 years.

2:38:23.680 --> 2:38:25.680
 Like a lot of pressure.

2:38:25.680 --> 2:38:30.680
 It seems like Earth, like the boring building might be explained in two ways.

2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:34.680
 One is super difficult to take any kind of next step.

2:38:34.680 --> 2:38:38.680
 And the second way it could be explained is there's no reason to take the next step.

2:38:38.680 --> 2:38:40.680
 No, I think there is no reason.

2:38:40.680 --> 2:38:44.680
 But at the end of it, there was a snowball Earth.

2:38:44.680 --> 2:38:54.680
 So there was a planetary catastrophe on a huge scale where the sea was frozen at the equator.

2:38:54.680 --> 2:38:58.680
 And that forced change in one way or another.

2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:02.680
 It's not long after that, 100 million years, perhaps after that, so not a short time,

2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:04.680
 but this is when we begin to see animals.

2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:11.680
 There was a shift again, another tipping point that led to catastrophic change that led to a takeoff then.

2:39:11.680 --> 2:39:20.680
 We don't really know why, but one of the reasons why that I discuss in the book is about sulfate being washed into the oceans,

2:39:20.680 --> 2:39:23.680
 which sounds incredibly parochial.

2:39:23.680 --> 2:39:35.680
 But what the data is showing, we can track roughly how oxygen was going into the atmosphere from carbon isotopes.

2:39:35.680 --> 2:39:39.680
 So there's two main isotopes of carbon that we need to think about here.

2:39:39.680 --> 2:39:42.680
 One is carbon 12, 99% of carbon is carbon 12.

2:39:42.680 --> 2:39:45.680
 And then 1% of carbon is carbon 13, which is a stable isotope.

2:39:45.680 --> 2:39:50.680
 And then there's carbon 14, which is a trivial radioactiveness, trivial amount.

2:39:50.680 --> 2:39:52.680
 So carbon 13 is 1%.

2:39:52.680 --> 2:40:01.680
 And life and enzymes generally, you can think of carbon atoms as little balls bouncing around, ping pong balls bouncing around.

2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:05.680
 Carbon 12 moves a little bit faster than carbon 13 because it's lighter.

2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:08.680
 And it's more likely to encounter an enzyme.

2:40:08.680 --> 2:40:11.680
 And so it's more likely to be fixed into organic matter.

2:40:11.680 --> 2:40:14.680
 And so organic matter is enriched, and this is just an observation.

2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:18.680
 It's enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent compared to carbon 13,

2:40:18.680 --> 2:40:21.680
 relative to what you would expect if it was just equal.

2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:31.680
 And if you then bury organic matter as coal or oil or whatever it may be, then it's no longer oxidized.

2:40:31.680 --> 2:40:34.680
 So some oxygen remains left over in the atmosphere.

2:40:34.680 --> 2:40:37.680
 And that's how oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere.

2:40:37.680 --> 2:40:43.680
 And you can work out historically how much oxygen there must have been in the atmosphere by how much carbon was being buried.

2:40:43.680 --> 2:40:46.680
 And you think, well, how can we possibly know how much carbon was being buried?

2:40:46.680 --> 2:40:51.680
 And the answer is, well, if you're burying carbon 12, what you're leaving behind is more carbon 13 in the oceans.

2:40:51.680 --> 2:40:53.680
 And that precipitates out in limestone.

2:40:53.680 --> 2:40:58.680
 So you can look at limestones over these ages and work out what's the carbon 13 signal.

2:40:58.680 --> 2:41:02.680
 And that gives you a kind of a feedback on what the oxygen content.

2:41:02.680 --> 2:41:08.680
 Right before the Cambrian explosion, there was what's called a negative isotope anomaly excursion,

2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:14.680
 which is basically the carbon 13 goes down by a massive amount and then back up again 10 million years later.

2:41:14.680 --> 2:41:25.680
 And what that seems to be saying is the amount of carbon 12 in the oceans was disappearing,

2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:29.680
 which is to say it was being oxidized.

2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:33.680
 And if it's being oxidized, it's consuming oxygen and that should.

2:41:33.680 --> 2:41:39.680
 So a big carbon 13 signal says the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is really going down,

2:41:39.680 --> 2:41:44.680
 which means there's much more carbon 12 being taken out and being oxidized.

2:41:44.680 --> 2:41:46.680
 Sorry, this is getting too complex.

2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:49.680
 Well, it's a good way to estimate the amount of oxygen.

2:41:49.680 --> 2:41:54.680
 If you calculate the amount of oxygen based on the assumption that all this carbon 12 that's being taken out

2:41:54.680 --> 2:41:58.680
 is being oxidized by oxygen, the answer is all the oxygen in the atmosphere gets stripped out.

2:41:58.680 --> 2:42:00.680
 There is none left.

2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:05.680
 And yet the rest of the geological indicators say, no, there's oxygen in the atmosphere.

2:42:05.680 --> 2:42:09.680
 So it's kind of a paradox and the only way to explain this paradox,

2:42:09.680 --> 2:42:14.680
 just on mass balance of how much stuff is in the air, how much stuff is in the oceans and so on,

2:42:14.680 --> 2:42:19.680
 is to assume that what oxygen was not the oxygen, it was sulfate.

2:42:19.680 --> 2:42:21.680
 Sulfate was being washed into the oceans.

2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:27.680
 It's used as an electron acceptor by sulfate reducing bacteria just as we use oxygen as an electron acceptor.

2:42:27.680 --> 2:42:30.680
 So they pass their electrons to sulfate instead of oxygen.

2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:32.680
 Bacteria did.

2:42:32.680 --> 2:42:36.680
 Yeah. So these are bacteria.

2:42:36.680 --> 2:42:42.680
 So they're oxidizing carbon, organic carbon with sulfate, passing the electrons onto sulfate.

2:42:42.680 --> 2:42:50.680
 That reacts with iron to form iron pyrides or fools gold, sinks down to the bottom, gets buried out of the system.

2:42:50.680 --> 2:42:53.680
 And this can account for the mass balance.

2:42:53.680 --> 2:42:55.680
 So why does it matter?

2:42:55.680 --> 2:42:59.680
 It matters because what it says is there was a chance event.

2:42:59.680 --> 2:43:05.680
 Tectonically, there was a lot of sulfate sitting on land as some kind of mineral.

2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:10.680
 So calcium sulfate minerals, for example, or evaporitic.

2:43:10.680 --> 2:43:17.680
 And because there happened to be some continental collisions, mountain building,

2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:23.680
 the sulfate was pushed up the side of a mountain and happened to get washed into the ocean.

2:43:23.680 --> 2:43:27.680
 Yeah. So I wonder how many happy accidents like that are possible.

2:43:27.680 --> 2:43:31.680
 Statistically, it's really hard. Maybe you can roll that in statistically.

2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:34.680
 This is the course of life on Earth.

2:43:34.680 --> 2:43:39.680
 Without all that sulfate being raised up, this Cambrian explosion almost certainly would not have happened.

2:43:39.680 --> 2:43:42.680
 And then we wouldn't have had animals and so on and so on.

2:43:42.680 --> 2:43:47.680
 So it's this kind of explanation of the Cambrian explosion.

2:43:47.680 --> 2:43:52.680
 So let me actually say in several ways.

2:43:52.680 --> 2:44:00.680
 Folks who challenge the validity of the theory of evolution will give us an example.

2:44:00.680 --> 2:44:02.680
 No, I'm not. We'll study it in this.

2:44:02.680 --> 2:44:06.680
 But we'll give us an example of the Cambrian explosion as like, this thing is weird.

2:44:06.680 --> 2:44:08.680
 Oh, it is weird.

2:44:08.680 --> 2:44:18.680
 So the question I would have is what's the biggest mystery or gap in understanding about evolution?

2:44:18.680 --> 2:44:24.680
 Is it the Cambrian explosion? And if so, how do we, what's our best understanding of how to explain?

2:44:24.680 --> 2:44:27.680
 First of all, what is it?

2:44:27.680 --> 2:44:33.680
 In my understanding, in the short amount of time, maybe 10 million years, 100 million years, something like that,

2:44:33.680 --> 2:44:39.680
 a huge number of animals, a variety, diversity of animals were created.

2:44:39.680 --> 2:44:41.680
 Anyway, there's like five questions in there.

2:44:41.680 --> 2:44:43.680
 Yeah. Is that the biggest mystery?

2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:46.680
 No, I don't think it's a particularly big mystery really anymore.

2:44:46.680 --> 2:44:53.680
 It's, there are still mysteries about why then, and I've just said sulfate being washed into the oceans is one,

2:44:53.680 --> 2:44:58.680
 it needs oxygen and oxygen levels rose around that time.

2:44:58.680 --> 2:45:02.680
 So probably before that, they weren't high enough for animals.

2:45:02.680 --> 2:45:07.680
 What we're seeing with the Cambrian explosion is the beginning of predators and prey relationships.

2:45:07.680 --> 2:45:19.680
 We're seeing modern ecosystems and we're seeing arms races and we're seeing the full creativity of evolution unleashed.

2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:28.680
 So I talked about the boring billion, nothing happens for one and a half billion years, one and a half billion years.

2:45:28.680 --> 2:45:35.680
 The assumption, and this is completely wrong, this assumption, is then that evolution works really slowly

2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:42.680
 and that you need billions of years to affect some small change and then another billion years to do something else.

2:45:42.680 --> 2:45:49.680
 And it's completely wrong. Evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it stays that way for tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years.

2:45:49.680 --> 2:45:53.680
 And Stephen Jay Gould used to argue this, he called it punctuated equilibrium,

2:45:53.680 --> 2:45:58.680
 but he was doing it to do with animals and to do with the last 500 million years or so,

2:45:58.680 --> 2:46:02.680
 where it's much less obvious than if you think about the entire planetary history.

2:46:02.680 --> 2:46:06.680
 And then you realise that the first two billion years was bacteria only.

2:46:06.680 --> 2:46:11.680
 You have the origin of life, two billion years of just bacteria, oxygenic photosynthesis arising here.

2:46:11.680 --> 2:46:17.680
 Then you have a global catastrophe, snowball earths and great oxidation event and then another billion years of nothing happening

2:46:17.680 --> 2:46:23.680
 and then some period of upheavals and then another snowball earth and then suddenly you see the Cambrian explosion.

2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:30.680
 This is long periods of stasis where the world is in a stable state and it's not geared towards increasing complexity.

2:46:30.680 --> 2:46:32.680
 It's just everything is in balance.

2:46:32.680 --> 2:46:37.680
 And only when you have a catastrophic level of global level problem like a snowball earth,

2:46:37.680 --> 2:46:41.680
 it forces everything out of balance and there's a tipping point and you end up somewhere else.

2:46:41.680 --> 2:46:47.680
 Now, the idea that evolution is slow is wrong.

2:46:47.680 --> 2:46:49.680
 It can be incredibly fast.

2:46:49.680 --> 2:46:55.680
 And I mentioned earlier on that you can, in theory, it would take half a million years to invent an eye,

2:46:55.680 --> 2:46:57.680
 for example, from a light sensitive spot.

2:46:57.680 --> 2:47:07.680
 It doesn't take long to convert one tube into a tube with nobles on it, into a tube with arms on it,

2:47:07.680 --> 2:47:11.680
 and then multiple arms and then one end is ahead with it and starts out as a swelling.

2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:17.680
 It's not difficult intellectually to understand how these things can happen.

2:47:17.680 --> 2:47:24.680
 It boggles the mind that it can happen so quickly, but we're used to human timescales.

2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:30.680
 And what we need to talk about is generations of things that live for a year in the ocean.

2:47:30.680 --> 2:47:35.680
 And then a million years is a million generations and the amount of change that you can do,

2:47:35.680 --> 2:47:38.680
 can affect in that period of time is enormous.

2:47:38.680 --> 2:47:45.680
 And we're dealing with large populations of things where selection is sensitive to pretty small changes and can...

2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:50.680
 So again, as soon as you throw in the competition of predators and prey

2:47:50.680 --> 2:47:55.680
 and you're ramping up the scale of evolution, it's not very surprising that it happens very quickly

2:47:55.680 --> 2:47:58.680
 when the environment allows it to happen.

2:47:58.680 --> 2:47:59.680
 So I don't think there's a big mystery.

2:47:59.680 --> 2:48:02.680
 There's lots of details that need to be filled in.

2:48:02.680 --> 2:48:10.680
 I mean, the big mystery in biology is consciousness.

2:48:10.680 --> 2:48:20.680
 Well, intelligence is kind of a mystery too.

2:48:20.680 --> 2:48:27.680
 I mean, you said biology, not psychology.

2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:34.680
 Because from a biology perspective, it seems like intelligence and consciousness all are the same, like weird...

2:48:34.680 --> 2:48:37.680
 Like all the brain stuff.

2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:42.680
 I don't see intelligence as necessarily that difficult, I suppose.

2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:48.680
 I mean, I see it as a form of computing and I don't know much about computing.

2:48:48.680 --> 2:48:50.680
 Well, you don't know much about consciousness either.

2:48:50.680 --> 2:48:57.680
 So I mean, I suppose, oh, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.

2:48:57.680 --> 2:49:00.680
 That consciousness you do know a lot about as a human being.

2:49:00.680 --> 2:49:07.680
 So, no, I mean, I think I can understand the wiring of a brain as a series of...

2:49:07.680 --> 2:49:16.680
 In pretty much the same way as a computer in theory, in terms of the circuitry of it.

2:49:16.680 --> 2:49:23.680
 The mystery to me is how this system gives rise to feelings as we were talking about earlier on.

2:49:23.680 --> 2:49:28.680
 Yeah, I think we oversimplify intelligence.

2:49:28.680 --> 2:49:35.680
 The magic of reasoning is as interesting as the magic of feeling.

2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:44.680
 We tend to think of reasoning as like running a very simplistic algorithm.

2:49:44.680 --> 2:49:54.680
 I think reasoning is the interplay between memory, whatever the hell is going on, the unconscious mind, all of that.

2:49:54.680 --> 2:49:58.680
 I'm not trying to diminish it in any way at all.

2:49:58.680 --> 2:50:06.680
 Obviously, it's extraordinarily exquisitely complex, but I don't see a logical difficulty with how it works.

2:50:06.680 --> 2:50:15.680
 Yeah, no, I mean, I agree with you, but sometimes, yeah, there's a big cloak of mystery around consciousness.

2:50:15.680 --> 2:50:19.680
 Let me compare it with classical versus quantum physics.

2:50:19.680 --> 2:50:27.680
 You know, classical physics is logical and you can understand the kind of language we're dealing with.

2:50:27.680 --> 2:50:31.680
 It's almost at the human level, we're dealing with stars and things that we can see.

2:50:31.680 --> 2:50:39.680
 And when you get to quantum mechanics and things, it's practically impossible for the human mind to compute what just happened there.

2:50:39.680 --> 2:50:41.680
 Yeah, I mean, that is the same.

2:50:41.680 --> 2:50:48.680
 It's like, you understand mathematically the notes of a musical composition, that's intelligence.

2:50:48.680 --> 2:50:49.680
 Yes.

2:50:49.680 --> 2:50:54.680
 But why makes you feel a certain way?

2:50:54.680 --> 2:50:57.680
 That is much harder to understand.

2:50:57.680 --> 2:51:05.680
 Yeah, that's really, but it was interesting framing that that's a mystery at the core of biology.

2:51:05.680 --> 2:51:09.680
 I wonder who solves consciousness.

2:51:09.680 --> 2:51:16.680
 I tend to think consciousness will be solved by the engineer, meaning the person who builds it,

2:51:16.680 --> 2:51:24.680
 who keeps trying to build the thing versus biology is such a complicated system.

2:51:24.680 --> 2:51:33.680
 I feel like it's, I feel like the building blocks of consciousness from a biological perspective are like,

2:51:33.680 --> 2:51:36.680
 that's like the final creation of a human being.

2:51:36.680 --> 2:51:38.680
 So you have to understand the whole damn thing.

2:51:38.680 --> 2:51:46.680
 You said electrical fields, but like electrical fields plus plus everything, the whole shebang.

2:51:46.680 --> 2:51:57.680
 I mean, trying to agree, I mean, my feeling is from my meager knowledge of the history of science is that the biggest breakthrough has usually come through from a field that was not related to it.

2:51:57.680 --> 2:52:06.680
 So if anyone, you know, is not going to be a biologist who solves consciousness, just because biologists are too embedded in the nature of the problem.

2:52:06.680 --> 2:52:15.680
 And then nobody's going to believe you when you've done it because nobody's going to be able to prove that this AI is in fact conscious and sad in any case,

2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:19.680
 and any more than you can prove that a dog is conscious and sad.

2:52:19.680 --> 2:52:24.680
 So it tells you that it is in good language and you must believe it.

2:52:24.680 --> 2:52:30.680
 But I think most people will accept if faced with that, that that's what it is.

2:52:30.680 --> 2:52:35.680
 All of this probability of complex life.

2:52:35.680 --> 2:52:53.680
 In one way, I think why it matters is that my expectation, I suppose, is that we will be over the next 100 years or so if we survive at all, that AI will increasingly dominate.

2:52:53.680 --> 2:53:03.680
 And pretty much anything that we put out into space going looking for other, well, for the universe for what's out there will be AI won't be won't be us.

2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:06.680
 We won't be doing that. Or when we do, it'll be on a much more limited scale.

2:53:06.680 --> 2:53:11.680
 I suppose the same would apply to any alien civilization.

2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:18.680
 So perhaps rather than looking for signs of life out there, we should be looking for AI out there.

2:53:18.680 --> 2:53:29.680
 But then we face the problem that I don't see how a planet is going to give rise directly to AI.

2:53:29.680 --> 2:53:33.680
 You can see how a planet can give rise directly to organic life.

2:53:33.680 --> 2:53:42.680
 And if the principles that govern the evolution of life on Earth apply to other planets as well, and I think a lot of them would,

2:53:42.680 --> 2:53:52.680
 then the likelihood of ending up with a human like civilization capable of giving rise to AI in the first place is massively limited.

2:53:52.680 --> 2:53:57.680
 Once you've done it once, perhaps it takes over the universe and maybe there's no issue.

2:53:57.680 --> 2:54:08.680
 It seems to me that the two are necessarily linked, that you're not going to just turn a sterile planet into an AI life form without the intermediary of the organics first.

2:54:08.680 --> 2:54:15.680
 You have to run the evolutionary computation with the organics to create AI.

2:54:15.680 --> 2:54:20.680
 How does AI bootstrap itself up without the aid of an intelligent designer?

2:54:20.680 --> 2:54:26.680
 The origin of AI is going to have to be in the chemistry of a planet.

2:54:26.680 --> 2:54:29.680
 But that's not a limiting factor, right?

2:54:29.680 --> 2:54:34.680
 Let me ask the Fermi Paradox question.

2:54:34.680 --> 2:54:48.680
 Let's say we live in this incredibly dark and beautiful world of just billions of planets with bacteria on it and very few intelligent civilizations.

2:54:48.680 --> 2:54:51.680
 And yet, there's a few out there.

2:54:51.680 --> 2:54:57.680
 Why haven't we at scale seen them visit us?

2:54:57.680 --> 2:54:59.680
 What's your sense?

2:54:59.680 --> 2:55:01.680
 Is it because they don't exist?

2:55:01.680 --> 2:55:04.680
 Well, don't exist in the right part of the universe at the right time.

2:55:04.680 --> 2:55:07.680
 That's the simplest answer for it.

2:55:07.680 --> 2:55:13.680
 Is that the one you find the most compelling or is there some other explanation?

2:55:13.680 --> 2:55:16.680
 I find that, no, it's not that I find it more compelling.

2:55:16.680 --> 2:55:22.680
 It's that I find more probable and I find all of them, I mean, there's a lot of hand waving in this.

2:55:22.680 --> 2:55:24.680
 We just don't know.

2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:30.680
 So I'm trying to read out from what I know about life on Earth to what might happen somewhere else.

2:55:30.680 --> 2:55:37.680
 It gives to my mind a bit of a pessimistic view of bacteria everywhere and only occasional intelligent life.

2:55:37.680 --> 2:55:48.680
 Running forward humans only once on Earth and nothing else that you would necessarily be any more excited about making contact with than you would be making contact with them on Earth.

2:55:48.680 --> 2:55:56.680
 So I think the chances are pretty limited and the chances of us surviving are pretty limited too.

2:55:56.680 --> 2:56:03.680
 The way we're going on at the moment, the likelihood of us not making ourselves extinct within the next few hundred years,

2:56:03.680 --> 2:56:07.680
 possibly within the next 50 or 100 years seems quite small.

2:56:07.680 --> 2:56:10.680
 I hope we can do better than that.

2:56:10.680 --> 2:56:21.680
 So maybe the only thing that will survive from humanity will be AI and maybe AI, once it exists and once it's capable of effectively copying itself and cutting humans out of the loop,

2:56:21.680 --> 2:56:24.680
 then maybe that will take over the universe.

2:56:24.680 --> 2:56:27.680
 I mean, there's a kind of inherent sadness to the way you described that.

2:56:27.680 --> 2:56:35.680
 But isn't that also potentially beautiful that that's the next step of life?

2:56:35.680 --> 2:56:41.680
 I suppose from your perspective, as long as it carries the flame of consciousness somehow.

2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:42.680
 I think yes.

2:56:42.680 --> 2:56:49.680
 There can be some beauty to it being the next step of life and I don't know if consciousness matters or not from that point of view, to be honest with you.

2:56:49.680 --> 2:56:50.680
 Yeah.

2:56:50.680 --> 2:56:59.680
 But there's some sadness, yes, probably because I think it comes down to the selfishness that we were talking about earlier on.

2:56:59.680 --> 2:57:06.680
 I am an individual with a desire not to be kind of displaced from life.

2:57:06.680 --> 2:57:07.680
 I want to stay alive.

2:57:07.680 --> 2:57:11.680
 I want to be here.

2:57:11.680 --> 2:57:24.680
 So I suppose the threat that a lot of people would feel is that we will just be wiped out, so that there will be potential conflicts between AI and humans and that AI will win because it's a lot smarter.

2:57:24.680 --> 2:57:36.680
 Boy, would that be a sad state of affairs if consciousness is just an intermediate stage between bacteria and AI, right?

2:57:36.680 --> 2:57:40.680
 Well, I would see bacteria as being potentially a kind of primitive form of consciousness anyway.

2:57:40.680 --> 2:57:47.680
 The whole of life on Earth, to my mind, is capable of some form of feelings in response to the environment.

2:57:47.680 --> 2:57:54.680
 That's not to say it's intelligent, though it's got its own algorithms for intelligence, but nothing comparable with us.

2:57:54.680 --> 2:57:58.680
 I think it's beautiful what a planet, what a sterile planet can come up with.

2:57:58.680 --> 2:58:09.680
 It's astonishing that it's come up with all of this stuff that we see around us and that either we or whatever we produce is capable of destroying all of that.

2:58:09.680 --> 2:58:16.680
 It is a sad thought, but it's also hugely pessimistic.

2:58:16.680 --> 2:58:23.680
 I'd like to think that we're capable of giving rise to something which is at least as good if not better than us as AI.

2:58:23.680 --> 2:58:35.680
 Yeah, I have that same optimism, especially a thing that is able to propagate throughout the universe more efficiently than humans can, or extensions of humans.

2:58:35.680 --> 2:58:41.680
 Some merger with AI and humans, where did that come from?

2:58:41.680 --> 2:58:53.680
 Bioengineering of the human body to extend its life somehow to carry that flame of consciousness and that personality and the beautiful tension that's within all of us.

2:58:53.680 --> 2:58:59.680
 Carry that through to multiple planets, to multiple solar systems all out there in the universe.

2:58:59.680 --> 2:59:07.680
 That's a beautiful vision, whether AI can do that or bioengineered humans can.

2:59:07.680 --> 2:59:14.680
 That's an exciting possibility, and especially meeting other alien civilizations in that same kind of way.

2:59:14.680 --> 2:59:16.680
 Do you think aliens have consciousness?

2:59:16.680 --> 2:59:18.680
 If they're organic.

2:59:18.680 --> 2:59:20.680
 Organic connected to consciousness.

2:59:20.680 --> 2:59:27.680
 I think any system which is going to bootstrap itself up from planetary origins.

2:59:27.680 --> 2:59:31.680
 Let me finish this and then come on to something else.

2:59:31.680 --> 2:59:39.680
 From planetary origins is going to face similar constraints, and those constraints are going to be addressed in similar basic engineering ways.

2:59:39.680 --> 2:59:47.680
 I think it will be cellular, and I think it will have electrical charges, and I think it will have to be selected in populations over time.

2:59:47.680 --> 2:59:52.680
 All of these things will tend to give rise to the same processes as the simplest fix to a difficult problem.

2:59:52.680 --> 2:59:59.680
 So I would expect it to be conscious, yes, and I would expect it to resemble life on Earth in many ways.

2:59:59.680 --> 3:00:07.680
 When I was about, I guess, 15 or 16, I remember reading a book by Fred Hoyle called The Black Cloud,

3:00:07.680 --> 3:00:15.680
 which I was budding biologists at the time, and this was the first time I'd come across someone really challenging the heart of biology and saying,

3:00:15.680 --> 3:00:23.680
 you are far too parochial, you're thinking about life as carbon based.

3:00:23.680 --> 3:00:31.680
 Here's a life form which is interstellar dust on a solar system scale.

3:00:31.680 --> 3:00:39.680
 It's a novel, but I felt enormously challenged by that novel because it hadn't occurred to me how limited my thinking was,

3:00:39.680 --> 3:00:47.680
 how narrow minded I was being, and here was a great physicist with a completely different conception of what life could be.

3:00:47.680 --> 3:00:58.680
 Since then, I've seen him attacked in various ways, and I'm reluctant to say the attacks make more sense to me than the original story,

3:00:58.680 --> 3:01:14.680
 which is to say, even in terms of information processing, if you're on that scale and there's a limit of the speed of light, how quickly can something think if you're needing to broadcast across the solar system,

3:01:14.680 --> 3:01:16.680
 it's going to be slow.

3:01:16.680 --> 3:01:25.680
 It's not going to hold a conversation with you on the kind of timelines that Fred Hoyle was imagining, or at least not by any easy way of doing it,

3:01:25.680 --> 3:01:28.680
 that speed of light is a limit.

3:01:28.680 --> 3:01:32.680
 And then again, you really can't.

3:01:32.680 --> 3:01:36.680
 This is something Richard Dawkins argued long ago, and I do think he's right.

3:01:36.680 --> 3:01:41.680
 There is no other way to generate this level of complexity than natural selection.

3:01:41.680 --> 3:01:42.680
 Nothing else can do it.

3:01:42.680 --> 3:01:46.680
 You need populations, and you need selection in populations,

3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:57.680
 and it kind of an isolated interstellar cloud. Again, it's unlimited time, and maybe there's no problems with distance,

3:01:57.680 --> 3:02:07.680
 but you need to have a certain frequency of generational time to generate a serious level of complexity.

3:02:07.680 --> 3:02:11.680
 And I just have a feeling it's never going to work.

3:02:11.680 --> 3:02:16.680
 Well, as far as we know, so natural selection and evolution is really powerful tool here on Earth,

3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:18.680
 but there could be other mechanisms.

3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:23.680
 So whenever, I don't know if you're familiar with cellular automata,

3:02:23.680 --> 3:02:32.680
 but complex systems that have really simple components and seemingly move based on simple rules when they're taken as a whole,

3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:35.680
 really interesting complexity emerges.

3:02:35.680 --> 3:02:38.680
 I don't know what the pressures on that are.

3:02:38.680 --> 3:02:42.680
 It's not really selection, but interesting complexity seems to emerge,

3:02:42.680 --> 3:02:46.680
 and that's not well understood exactly why that complexity emerges.

3:02:46.680 --> 3:02:50.680
 I think there's a difference between complexity and evolution.

3:02:50.680 --> 3:02:58.680
 So some of the work we're doing on the origin of life is thinking about how does genes arise,

3:02:58.680 --> 3:03:01.680
 how does information arise in biology,

3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:05.680
 and thinking about it from the point of view of reacting CO2 with hydrogen,

3:03:05.680 --> 3:03:09.680
 what do you get? Well, what you're going to get is coboxylic acids and amino acids.

3:03:09.680 --> 3:03:14.680
 It's quite hard to make nucleotides, and it's possible to make them,

3:03:14.680 --> 3:03:17.680
 and it's been done, and it's been done following this pathway as well.

3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:19.680
 But you make trace amounts.

3:03:19.680 --> 3:03:23.680
 And so the next question, assuming that this is the right way of seeing the question,

3:03:23.680 --> 3:03:26.680
 which maybe it's just not, but let's assume it is,

3:03:26.680 --> 3:03:29.680
 is, well, how do you reliably make more nucleotides then?

3:03:29.680 --> 3:03:34.680
 How do you become more complex and better at becoming a nucleotide generating machine?

3:03:34.680 --> 3:03:37.680
 And the answer is, well, you need positive feedback loops,

3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:39.680
 some form of autocatalysis.

3:03:39.680 --> 3:03:42.680
 So that can work, and we know it happens in biology.

3:03:42.680 --> 3:03:47.680
 If this nucleotide, for example, catalyzes CO2 fixation,

3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:50.680
 then you're going to increase the rate of flux through the whole system,

3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:55.680
 and you're going to effectively steepen the driving force to make more nucleotides.

3:03:55.680 --> 3:04:02.680
 And this can be inherited because there are forms of membrane heredity that you can have,

3:04:02.680 --> 3:04:07.680
 and effectively, if a cell divides in two and it's got a lot of stuff inside it,

3:04:07.680 --> 3:04:13.680
 and that stuff is basically bound as a network which is capable of regenerating itself,

3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:16.680
 then it will inevitably regenerate itself.

3:04:16.680 --> 3:04:20.680
 And so you can develop greater complexity.

3:04:20.680 --> 3:04:25.680
 But everything that I've said depends on the underlying rules of thermodynamics.

3:04:25.680 --> 3:04:27.680
 There is no evolvability about that.

3:04:27.680 --> 3:04:32.680
 It's simply an inevitable outcome of your starting point,

3:04:32.680 --> 3:04:36.680
 assuming that you're able to increase the driving force through the system.

3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:39.680
 You will generate more of the same, you'll expand on what you can do,

3:04:39.680 --> 3:04:42.680
 but you'll never get anything different than that.

3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:46.680
 And it's only when you introduce information into that as a gene,

3:04:46.680 --> 3:04:53.680
 as a kind of small stretch of RNA, which can be random stretch,

3:04:53.680 --> 3:04:56.680
 then you get real evolvability, then you get biology as we know it.

3:04:56.680 --> 3:04:59.680
 But you also have selection as we know it.

3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:04.680
 Yeah, I mean, I don't know how to think about information.

3:05:04.680 --> 3:05:07.680
 That's the kind of memory of the system.

3:05:07.680 --> 3:05:12.680
 At the local level, it's propagation of copying yourself and changing

3:05:12.680 --> 3:05:16.680
 and improving your adaptability to the environment.

3:05:16.680 --> 3:05:22.680
 But if you look at Earth as a whole, it has a kind of memory.

3:05:22.680 --> 3:05:24.680
 That's the key feature of it.

3:05:24.680 --> 3:05:27.680
 In what way?

3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:30.680
 It remembers the stuff it tries.

3:05:30.680 --> 3:05:33.680
 Like if you were to describe Earth,

3:05:33.680 --> 3:05:41.680
 I think evolution is something that we experience as individual organisms.

3:05:41.680 --> 3:05:45.680
 That's how the individual organisms interact with each other.

3:05:45.680 --> 3:05:47.680
 There's a natural selection.

3:05:47.680 --> 3:05:53.680
 But when you look at Earth as an organism in its entirety,

3:05:53.680 --> 3:05:55.680
 how would you describe it?

3:05:55.680 --> 3:05:57.680
 Well, not as an organism.

3:05:57.680 --> 3:06:00.680
 I mean, the idea of Gaia is lovely.

3:06:00.680 --> 3:06:06.680
 And James Lovelock originally put Gaia out as an organism that had somehow evolved.

3:06:06.680 --> 3:06:09.680
 And he was immediately attacked by lots of people.

3:06:09.680 --> 3:06:13.680
 And he's not wrong, but he backpedaled somewhat,

3:06:13.680 --> 3:06:19.680
 because that was more of a poetic vision than the science.

3:06:19.680 --> 3:06:23.680
 The science is now called Earth systems science.

3:06:23.680 --> 3:06:26.680
 And it's really about how does the world kind of regulate itself,

3:06:26.680 --> 3:06:29.680
 so it remains within the limits which are hospitable to life.

3:06:29.680 --> 3:06:31.680
 And it does it amazingly well.

3:06:31.680 --> 3:06:38.680
 And it is working at a planetary level of kind of integration, of regulation.

3:06:38.680 --> 3:06:41.680
 But it's not evolving by natural selection.

3:06:41.680 --> 3:06:43.680
 And it can't because there's only one of it.

3:06:43.680 --> 3:06:46.680
 And so it can change over time, but it's not evolving.

3:06:46.680 --> 3:06:50.680
 All the evolution is happening in the parts of the system.

3:06:50.680 --> 3:06:52.680
 Yeah, but it's a self sustaining organism.

3:06:52.680 --> 3:06:55.680
 No, it's sustained by the sun.

3:06:55.680 --> 3:06:56.680
 Right.

3:06:56.680 --> 3:07:02.680
 So you don't think it's possible to see Earth as its own organism?

3:07:02.680 --> 3:07:04.680
 I think it's poetic and beautiful.

3:07:04.680 --> 3:07:07.680
 And I often refer to the Earth as a living planet.

3:07:07.680 --> 3:07:12.680
 But it's not in biological terms an organism.

3:07:12.680 --> 3:07:14.680
 No.

3:07:14.680 --> 3:07:20.680
 If aliens were to visit Earth, what would they notice?

3:07:20.680 --> 3:07:23.680
 What would be the basic unit of light they would notice?

3:07:23.680 --> 3:07:24.680
 Trees, probably.

3:07:24.680 --> 3:07:26.680
 I mean, it's green and blue.

3:07:26.680 --> 3:07:28.680
 I think that's the first thing you'd notice.

3:07:28.680 --> 3:07:32.680
 It stands out from space as being different to any of the other planets.

3:07:32.680 --> 3:07:35.680
 So it would notice the trees at first?

3:07:35.680 --> 3:07:38.680
 Well, I would notice the green, yes.

3:07:38.680 --> 3:07:42.680
 And then probably notice to figure out the photosynthesis.

3:07:42.680 --> 3:07:46.680
 Probably notice cities a second, I suspect, at first.

3:07:46.680 --> 3:07:47.680
 They arrived at night.

3:07:47.680 --> 3:07:49.680
 They noticed cities first, that's for sure.

3:07:49.680 --> 3:07:51.680
 It depends the time.

3:07:51.680 --> 3:07:55.680
 You write quite beautifully in Transformers once again.

3:07:55.680 --> 3:07:57.680
 I think you opened the book in this way.

3:07:57.680 --> 3:07:58.680
 I don't remember.

3:07:58.680 --> 3:08:05.680
 From space describing Earth, it's such an interesting idea of what Earth is.

3:08:05.680 --> 3:08:13.680
 You also, I mean, Hitchhiker's Guide summarizing it as harmless, or mostly harmless,

3:08:13.680 --> 3:08:15.680
 which is a beautifully poetic thing.

3:08:15.680 --> 3:08:21.680
 You open Transformers with from space, it looks gray and crystalline,

3:08:21.680 --> 3:08:24.680
 obliterating the blue, green colors of the living Earth.

3:08:24.680 --> 3:08:30.680
 It is crisscrossed by regular patterns and convergent striations.

3:08:30.680 --> 3:08:34.680
 There's a central amorphous density where these scratches seem lighter.

3:08:34.680 --> 3:08:40.680
 This, quote, growth does not look alive, although it has extended out along some lines

3:08:40.680 --> 3:08:44.680
 and there is something grasping and parasitic about it.

3:08:44.680 --> 3:08:48.680
 Across the globe, there are thousands of them, varying in shape and detail,

3:08:48.680 --> 3:08:53.680
 but all of them gray, angular, and organic, spreading.

3:08:53.680 --> 3:08:56.680
 Yet, at night, they light up.

3:08:56.680 --> 3:08:59.680
 Going up the dark sky, suddenly beautiful.

3:08:59.680 --> 3:09:04.680
 Perhaps these cankers on the landscape are, in some sense, living.

3:09:04.680 --> 3:09:06.680
 There's a controlled flow of energy.

3:09:06.680 --> 3:09:11.680
 There must be information and some form of metabolism, some turnover of materials.

3:09:11.680 --> 3:09:13.680
 Are they alive?

3:09:13.680 --> 3:09:15.680
 No, of course not.

3:09:15.680 --> 3:09:17.680
 They are cities.

3:09:17.680 --> 3:09:21.680
 So is there some sense that cities are living beings?

3:09:21.680 --> 3:09:24.680
 You think aliens would think of them as living beings?

3:09:24.680 --> 3:09:29.680
 Well, it would be easy to see it that way, wouldn't it?

3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:32.680
 It wakes up at night, they wake up at night.

3:09:32.680 --> 3:09:35.680
 Strictly nocturnal, yes.

3:09:35.680 --> 3:09:39.680
 I imagine that any aliens that are smart enough to get here would understand

3:09:39.680 --> 3:09:42.680
 that they're not living beings.

3:09:42.680 --> 3:09:52.680
 My reason for saying that is that we tend to think of biology in terms of information

3:09:52.680 --> 3:09:54.680
 and forget about cells.

3:09:54.680 --> 3:09:57.680
 I was trying to draw a comparison between the cell as a city

3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:01.680
 and the energy flow through the city and the energy flow through cells

3:10:01.680 --> 3:10:03.680
 and the turnover of materials.

3:10:03.680 --> 3:10:11.680
 An interesting thing about cities is that they're not really exactly governed by anybody.

3:10:11.680 --> 3:10:18.680
 There are regulations and systems and whatever else, but it's pretty loose.

3:10:18.680 --> 3:10:23.680
 They have their own life, their own way of developing over time.

3:10:23.680 --> 3:10:26.680
 In that sense, they're quite biological.

3:10:26.680 --> 3:10:30.680
 There was a plan after the Great Fire of London.

3:10:30.680 --> 3:10:35.680
 Christopher Wren was making plans not only for St Paul's Cathedral,

3:10:35.680 --> 3:10:39.680
 but also to rebuild in large Parisian type boulevards,

3:10:39.680 --> 3:10:44.680
 a large part of the area of central London that was burnt.

3:10:44.680 --> 3:10:47.680
 It never happened because they didn't have enough money, I think.

3:10:47.680 --> 3:10:49.680
 But it's interesting what was in the plan.

3:10:49.680 --> 3:10:56.680
 There were all these boulevards, but there were no pubs and no coffee houses or anything like that.

3:10:56.680 --> 3:11:02.680
 The reality was London just kind of grew up in a set of jumbled streets.

3:11:02.680 --> 3:11:06.680
 It was the coffee house and the pubs where all the business of the city of London was being done.

3:11:06.680 --> 3:11:08.680
 That was where the real life of the city was.

3:11:08.680 --> 3:11:09.680
 No one had planned it.

3:11:09.680 --> 3:11:13.680
 The whole thing was unplanned and works much better that way.

3:11:13.680 --> 3:11:17.680
 And in that sense, the cell is completely unplanned, is not controlled by the genes in the nucleus

3:11:17.680 --> 3:11:19.680
 in the way that we might like to think that it is.

3:11:19.680 --> 3:11:25.680
 But it's this kind of evolved entity that has the same kind of flux, the same animation, the same life.

3:11:25.680 --> 3:11:31.680
 So I think it's a beautiful analogy, but I wouldn't get too stuck with it as a metaphor.

3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:33.680
 See, I disagree with you.

3:11:33.680 --> 3:11:34.680
 I disagree with you.

3:11:34.680 --> 3:11:43.680
 I think you are so steeped in actually the entirety of science.

3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:49.680
 The history of science is steeped in a biological framework of thinking about what is life.

3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:53.680
 And not just biological, it's very human centric too.

3:11:53.680 --> 3:12:00.680
 The human organism is the epitome of life on Earth.

3:12:00.680 --> 3:12:01.680
 I don't know.

3:12:01.680 --> 3:12:08.680
 I think there is some defundamental way in which a city is a living being in the same way that a human...

3:12:08.680 --> 3:12:12.680
 But it doesn't give rise to an offspring city.

3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:15.680
 It doesn't work by natural selection.

3:12:15.680 --> 3:12:17.680
 It works by, if anything, memes.

3:12:17.680 --> 3:12:23.680
 It works by copying itself conceptually as a mode of being.

3:12:23.680 --> 3:12:31.680
 So maybe memes, maybe ideas are the organisms that are really essential to life on Earth.

3:12:31.680 --> 3:12:36.680
 Maybe it's much more important about the collective aspect of human nature,

3:12:36.680 --> 3:12:39.680
 the collective intelligence than the individual intelligence.

3:12:39.680 --> 3:12:43.680
 Maybe the collective humanity is the organism.

3:12:43.680 --> 3:12:49.680
 And the thing that defines the collective intelligence of humanity is the ideas.

3:12:49.680 --> 3:12:53.680
 And maybe the way that manifests itself is cities.

3:12:53.680 --> 3:12:59.680
 Or societies or geographically constrained societies or nations and all that kind of stuff.

3:12:59.680 --> 3:13:08.680
 I mean, from an alien perspective, it's possible that that is the more deeply noticeable thing, not from a place of ignorance.

3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:11.680
 What's noticeable doesn't tell you how it works.

3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:17.680
 I don't have any problem with what you're saying, really, except that it's not possible

3:13:17.680 --> 3:13:20.680
 without the humans...

3:13:20.680 --> 3:13:26.680
 We went from a hunter gatherer type economy, if you like, without cities.

3:13:26.680 --> 3:13:32.680
 And as soon as we get into human evolution and culture and society and so on,

3:13:32.680 --> 3:13:37.680
 then yes, there are other forms of evolution, other forms of change.

3:13:37.680 --> 3:13:41.680
 But cities don't directly propagate themselves.

3:13:41.680 --> 3:13:43.680
 They propagate themselves through human societies.

3:13:43.680 --> 3:13:48.680
 In fact, human societies only exist because humans, as individuals, propagate themselves.

3:13:48.680 --> 3:13:51.680
 So there is a hierarchy there.

3:13:51.680 --> 3:13:54.680
 And without the humans in the first place, none of the rest of it exists.

3:13:54.680 --> 3:14:01.680
 So do you... life is primarily defined by the basic unit on which evolution can operate?

3:14:01.680 --> 3:14:04.680
 I think it's a really important thing, yes.

3:14:04.680 --> 3:14:06.680
 Yeah.

3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:10.680
 And we don't have any other better ideas than evolution for how to create one.

3:14:10.680 --> 3:14:13.680
 I never came across a better idea than evolution.

3:14:13.680 --> 3:14:16.680
 I mean, maybe I'm just ignorant and I don't know.

3:14:16.680 --> 3:14:19.680
 You mentioned automator and so on.

3:14:19.680 --> 3:14:24.680
 And I don't think specifically about that, but I have thought about it in terms of selective units

3:14:24.680 --> 3:14:29.680
 at the origin of life and the difference between evolvability and complexity,

3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:35.680
 or just increasing complexity, but within very narrowly defined limits.

3:14:35.680 --> 3:14:41.680
 The great thing about genes and about selection is it just knocks down all those limits.

3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:47.680
 It gives you a world of information in the end, which is limited only by the biophysical reality

3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:52.680
 of what kind of an organism you are, what kind of a planet you live on and so on.

3:14:52.680 --> 3:14:57.680
 And cities and all these other forms that look alive and could be described as alive,

3:14:57.680 --> 3:15:04.680
 because they can't propagate themselves, can only exist as the product of something that did propagate itself.

3:15:04.680 --> 3:15:06.680
 Yeah.

3:15:06.680 --> 3:15:11.680
 I mean, there's a deeply compelling truth to that kind of way of looking at things,

3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:18.680
 but I just hope that we don't miss the giant cloud among us.

3:15:18.680 --> 3:15:25.680
 I kind of hope that I'm wrong about a lot of this, because I can't say that my world view is particularly uplifting.

3:15:25.680 --> 3:15:29.680
 But in some sense, it doesn't matter if it's uplifting or not.

3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:33.680
 Science is about what's reality, what's out there.

3:15:33.680 --> 3:15:35.680
 Why is it this way?

3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:38.680
 And I think there's beauty in that too.

3:15:38.680 --> 3:15:40.680
 There's beauty in darkness.

3:15:40.680 --> 3:15:45.680
 You write about life and death sort of at the biological level.

3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:53.680
 Does the question of suicide, why live, does the question of why the human mind is capable of depression,

3:15:53.680 --> 3:15:59.680
 are you able to introspect that from a place of biology?

3:15:59.680 --> 3:16:04.680
 Why our minds, why we humans can go to such dark places?

3:16:04.680 --> 3:16:07.680
 Why can we commit suicide?

3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:15.680
 Why can we go, you know, suffer, suffer a period,

3:16:15.680 --> 3:16:22.680
 but also suffer from a feeling of meaninglessness of going to a dark place that depression can take you?

3:16:22.680 --> 3:16:26.680
 Is this a feature of life or is it a bug?

3:16:26.680 --> 3:16:30.680
 I don't know.

3:16:30.680 --> 3:16:35.680
 I mean, if it's a feature of life, then I suppose it would have to be true of other organisms as well.

3:16:35.680 --> 3:16:43.680
 And I don't know, we were talking about dogs earlier on and they can certainly be very sad and upset

3:16:43.680 --> 3:16:47.680
 and may mooch for days after their owner died or something like that.

3:16:47.680 --> 3:16:51.680
 So I suspect in some sense it's a feature of biology.

3:16:51.680 --> 3:16:57.680
 It's probably a feature of mortality.

3:16:57.680 --> 3:17:01.680
 But beyond all of that, I mean, I guess there's two ways you could come at it.

3:17:01.680 --> 3:17:09.680
 There's one of them would be to say, well, you can effectively do the math and come to the conclusion that it's all pointless

3:17:09.680 --> 3:17:13.680
 and that there's really no point in me being here any longer.

3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:21.680
 And maybe that's true in the greater scheme of things, you can justify yourself in terms of society, but society will be gone soon enough as well.

3:17:21.680 --> 3:17:25.680
 And you end up with a very bleak place just by logic.

3:17:25.680 --> 3:17:29.680
 In some sense, it's surprising that we can find any meaning at all.

3:17:29.680 --> 3:17:33.680
 Well, maybe this is where consciousness comes in, that we have transient joy.

3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:36.680
 But with transient joy, we have transient misery as well.

3:17:36.680 --> 3:17:44.680
 And sometimes with everything in biology, getting the regulation right is practically impossible.

3:17:44.680 --> 3:17:51.680
 You will always have a bell shaped curve where some people, unfortunately, are at the joy end and some people are at the misery end.

3:17:51.680 --> 3:17:54.680
 And that's the way brains are wired.

3:17:54.680 --> 3:17:57.680
 And I doubt there's ever an escape from that.

3:17:57.680 --> 3:18:00.680
 It's the same with sex and everything else as well.

3:18:00.680 --> 3:18:11.680
 Or dealing with it, whether you can't regulate it, so anything goes, it's all part of biology.

3:18:11.680 --> 3:18:13.680
 Amen to that.

3:18:13.680 --> 3:18:20.680
 Let me, on writing in your book, Power Sex and Suicide.

3:18:20.680 --> 3:18:23.680
 First of all, can I just read off the books you've written?

3:18:23.680 --> 3:18:28.680
 If there's any better titles and topics to be covered, I don't know what they are.

3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:31.680
 It makes me look forward to whatever you're going to write next.

3:18:31.680 --> 3:18:33.680
 I hope there's things you write next.

3:18:33.680 --> 3:18:41.680
 So first, you wrote Oxygen, the molecule that made the world, as we've talked about, this idea of the role of oxygen in life on Earth.

3:18:41.680 --> 3:18:43.680
 Then, wait for it.

3:18:43.680 --> 3:18:47.680
 Power, sex, suicide, mitochondria, and the meaning of life.

3:18:47.680 --> 3:18:51.680
 Then, life ascending, the ten great inventions of evolution.

3:18:51.680 --> 3:18:57.680
 The vital question, the first book I've read of yours, the vital question, why is life the way it is?

3:18:57.680 --> 3:19:02.680
 And the new book, Transformer, the Deep Chemistry of Life and Death.

3:19:02.680 --> 3:19:12.680
 In Power, Sex and Suicide, you write about writing, or about a lot of things, but I have a question about writing.

3:19:12.680 --> 3:19:26.680
 You write, in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Ford Perfect spends 15 years researching his revision to the guide's entry on the Earth, which originally read, harmless.

3:19:26.680 --> 3:19:34.680
 By the way, I would also, as a side quest, as a side question, would like to ask you what would be your summary of what Earth is.

3:19:34.680 --> 3:19:41.680
 You write, his long essay on the subject is edited down by the guide to read, mostly harmless.

3:19:41.680 --> 3:19:51.680
 I suspect that too many new additions suffer similar fate, if not through absurd editing decisions, at least through a lack of meaningful change in content.

3:19:51.680 --> 3:20:02.680
 As it happens, nearly 15 years have passed since the first edition of Power, Sex, Suicide was published, and I am resisting the temptation to make any lame revisions.

3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:15.680
 Some say that even Darwin lessened the power of his arguments in the origin of species through his multiple revisions, in which he dealt with criticisms and sometimes shifted his views in the wrong direction.

3:20:15.680 --> 3:20:22.680
 I prefer my original to speak for itself, even if it turns out to be wrong.

3:20:22.680 --> 3:20:32.680
 Let me ask the question about writing, both your students in the academic setting, but also writing some of the most brilliant writings on science and humanity I've ever read.

3:20:32.680 --> 3:20:35.680
 What's the process of writing?

3:20:35.680 --> 3:20:42.680
 How do you advise other humans?

3:20:42.680 --> 3:20:55.680
 If you were to talk to young Darwin or the young you and just young anybody and give advice about how to write and how to write well about these big topics, what would you say?

3:20:55.680 --> 3:20:58.680
 I suppose there's a couple of points.

3:20:58.680 --> 3:21:02.680
 One of them is what's the story?

3:21:02.680 --> 3:21:04.680
 What do I want to know?

3:21:04.680 --> 3:21:05.680
 What do I want to convey?

3:21:05.680 --> 3:21:08.680
 Why does it matter to anybody?

3:21:08.680 --> 3:21:23.680
 And very often the biggest, most interesting questions, the childlike questions are the one that actually everybody wants to ask, but then quite do it in case they look stupid.

3:21:23.680 --> 3:21:33.680
 And one of the nice things about being in science is the longer you're in, the more you realize that everybody doesn't know the answer to these questions and it's not so stupid to ask them after all.

3:21:33.680 --> 3:21:57.680
 So trying to ask the questions that I would have been asking myself at the age of 15, 16 when I was really hungry to know about the world and didn't know very much about it and wanted to go to the edge of what we know, but be helped to get there.

3:21:57.680 --> 3:22:06.680
 I don't want to be too much terminology and so I want someone to keep a clean eye on what the question is.

3:22:06.680 --> 3:22:12.680
 Beyond that, I've wondered a lot about who am I writing for?

3:22:12.680 --> 3:22:19.680
 And that was in the end, the only answer I had was myself at the age of 15 or 16.

3:22:19.680 --> 3:22:27.680
 Because even if you just don't know who's reading but also where are they reading it?

3:22:27.680 --> 3:22:34.680
 Are they reading it in the bath or in bed or on the metro or listening to an audiobook?

3:22:34.680 --> 3:22:43.680
 Do you want to have a recapitulation every few pages because you read three pages at a time or are you really irritated by that?

3:22:43.680 --> 3:22:51.680
 You're going to get criticism from people who are irritated by what you're doing and you don't know who they are or what you're going to do that's going to irritate people.

3:22:51.680 --> 3:22:56.680
 And in the end, all you can do is just try and please yourself.

3:22:56.680 --> 3:23:02.680
 And that means, well, what are these big fun, fascinating, big questions?

3:23:02.680 --> 3:23:04.680
 And what do we know about it?

3:23:04.680 --> 3:23:06.680
 And can I convey that?

3:23:06.680 --> 3:23:13.680
 And I kind of learned in trying to write, first of all, say what we know.

3:23:13.680 --> 3:23:20.680
 And I was shocked in the first couple of books how often I came up quickly against all the stuff we don't know.

3:23:20.680 --> 3:23:33.680
 And if you're trying to, I've realized later on in supervising various physicists and mathematicians who are PhD students and their maths is way beyond what I can do.

3:23:33.680 --> 3:23:37.680
 But the process of trying to work out, what are we actually going to model here?

3:23:37.680 --> 3:23:38.680
 What's going into this equation?

3:23:38.680 --> 3:23:39.680
 It's a very similar one to writing.

3:23:39.680 --> 3:23:41.680
 What am I going to put on a page?

3:23:41.680 --> 3:23:49.680
 What's the simplest possible way I can encapsulate this idea so that I now have it as a unit that I can kind of see how it interacts with the other units?

3:23:49.680 --> 3:23:57.680
 And you realize that, well, if this is like that and this is like this, then that can't be true.

3:23:57.680 --> 3:24:04.680
 So you end up navigating your own path through this landscape and that can be thrilling because you don't know where it's going.

3:24:04.680 --> 3:24:13.680
 And I'd like to think that that's one of the reasons my books have worked for people because this sense of the thrilling adventure ride, I don't know where it's going either.

3:24:13.680 --> 3:24:22.680
 So finding the simplest possible way to explain the things we know and the simplest possible way to explain the things we don't know and the tension between those two.

3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:24.680
 And that's where the story emerges.

3:24:24.680 --> 3:24:26.680
 What about the edit?

3:24:26.680 --> 3:24:35.680
 Do you find yourself to the point of this editing doll to mostly harmless?

3:24:35.680 --> 3:24:43.680
 To arrive at simplicity, do you find the edit is productive or does it destroy the magic that was originally there?

3:24:43.680 --> 3:24:48.680
 No, I usually find, I think I'm perhaps a better editor than I am a writer.

3:24:48.680 --> 3:24:50.680
 I write and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite.

3:24:50.680 --> 3:24:55.680
 Put a bunch of crap on the page first and then see where the edit where it takes place.

3:24:55.680 --> 3:24:59.680
 But then there's the professional editors who come along as well.

3:24:59.680 --> 3:25:07.680
 And I mean, in Transformer, the editor came back to me after I'd sent him two months after I sent the first edition.

3:25:07.680 --> 3:25:13.680
 He'd read the whole thing and he said, the first two chapters prevent a formidable hurdle to the general reader.

3:25:13.680 --> 3:25:15.680
 Go and do something about it.

3:25:15.680 --> 3:25:18.680
 And it was the last thing I really wanted to do.

3:25:18.680 --> 3:25:21.680
 Your editor sounds very eloquent in speech.

3:25:21.680 --> 3:25:28.680
 Well, this was an email, but I thought about it and, you know, the bottom line is he was right.

3:25:28.680 --> 3:25:33.680
 And so I put the whole thing aside for about two months, spent the summer.

3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:36.680
 This would have been, I guess, last summer.

3:25:36.680 --> 3:25:42.680
 And then turn to it with full attention in about September or something and rewrote those chapters almost from scratch.

3:25:42.680 --> 3:25:48.680
 I kept some of the material, but it took me a long time to process it to work out what needs to change.

3:25:48.680 --> 3:25:51.680
 Where does it need to change? I wasn't writing in this time.

3:25:51.680 --> 3:25:54.680
 How am I going to tell the story better so it's more accessible and interesting?

3:25:54.680 --> 3:25:56.680
 And in the end, I think it worked.

3:25:56.680 --> 3:25:59.680
 It's still difficult. It's still biochemistry.

3:25:59.680 --> 3:26:03.680
 But as he ended up saying, now he's got a barreling energy to it.

3:26:03.680 --> 3:26:06.680
 And I was, you know, because he'd told me the truth the first time,

3:26:06.680 --> 3:26:12.680
 I decided to believe that he was telling me the truth the second time as well and was delighted.

3:26:12.680 --> 3:26:17.680
 Could you give advice to young people in general?

3:26:17.680 --> 3:26:22.680
 Folks in high school, folks in college, how to take on some of the big questions you've taken on.

3:26:22.680 --> 3:26:25.680
 Now you've done that in the space of biology and expanded out.

3:26:25.680 --> 3:26:34.680
 How can they have a career they can be proud of or have a life they can be proud of?

3:26:34.680 --> 3:26:37.680
 Gosh, that's a big question.

3:26:37.680 --> 3:26:45.680
 I'm sure you've gathered some wisdom that you can impart onto young populace.

3:26:45.680 --> 3:26:54.680
 So the only advice that I actually ever give to my students is follow what you're interested in.

3:26:54.680 --> 3:27:01.680
 Because they're often worried that if they make this decision now and do this course instead of that course,

3:27:01.680 --> 3:27:07.680
 then they're going to restrict their career opportunities and there isn't a career path in science.

3:27:07.680 --> 3:27:16.680
 It's not, I mean, there is, but there isn't. There's a lot of competition, there's a lot of death symbolically.

3:27:16.680 --> 3:27:18.680
 So who survives?

3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:24.680
 The people who survive are the people who care enough to still do it.

3:27:24.680 --> 3:27:32.680
 And they're very often the people who don't worry too much about the future and are able to live in the present.

3:27:32.680 --> 3:27:39.680
 Because if you do a PhD, you've competed hard to get onto the PhD, then you have to compete hard to get a postdoc job.

3:27:39.680 --> 3:27:45.680
 And you have the next one maybe on another continent and it's only two years anyway.

3:27:45.680 --> 3:27:51.680
 And there's no guarantee you're going to get a faculty position at the end of it.

3:27:51.680 --> 3:27:54.680
 And there's always the next step to compete.

3:27:54.680 --> 3:27:57.680
 If you get a faculty position, you get a tenure.

3:27:57.680 --> 3:28:02.680
 And with tenure, you go full professor, full professor, then you go to some kind of whatever the discipline is.

3:28:02.680 --> 3:28:03.680
 There's an award.

3:28:03.680 --> 3:28:06.680
 If you're in physics, you're always competing for the Nobel Prize.

3:28:06.680 --> 3:28:07.680
 There's different awards.

3:28:07.680 --> 3:28:12.680
 And then eventually you're all competing to, I mean, there's always a competition.

3:28:12.680 --> 3:28:14.680
 So there is no happiness. Happiness does not lie.

3:28:14.680 --> 3:28:16.680
 If you're looking into the future, yes.

3:28:16.680 --> 3:28:21.680
 And if what you're caring about is a career, then it's probably not the one for you.

3:28:21.680 --> 3:28:30.680
 If though you can put that aside, and you know, I've also worked in industry for a brief period and I was main redundant twice.

3:28:30.680 --> 3:28:37.680
 So I know that there's no guarantee that you've got a career that way either.

3:28:37.680 --> 3:28:38.680
 Yes.

3:28:38.680 --> 3:28:43.680
 So live in the moment and try and enjoy what you're doing.

3:28:43.680 --> 3:28:52.680
 And that means really go to the themes that you're most interested in and try and follow them as well as you can.

3:28:52.680 --> 3:28:56.680
 And that tends to pay back in surprising ways.

3:28:56.680 --> 3:29:03.680
 I don't know if you've found this as well, but I found that people will help you often.

3:29:03.680 --> 3:29:15.680
 If they see some light shining in the eye, you're excited about their subject and just want to talk about it.

3:29:15.680 --> 3:29:19.680
 And they know that their friend in California has got a job coming up.

3:29:19.680 --> 3:29:21.680
 They'll say, go for this, this guy's all right.

3:29:21.680 --> 3:29:26.680
 They'll use the network to help you out if you really care.

3:29:26.680 --> 3:29:29.680
 And you're not going to have a job two years down the line.

3:29:29.680 --> 3:29:35.680
 But if what you really care about is what you're doing now, then it doesn't matter if you have a job in two years time or not.

3:29:35.680 --> 3:29:39.680
 It'll work itself out if you've got the light in your eye.

3:29:39.680 --> 3:29:42.680
 And so that's the only advice I can give.

3:29:42.680 --> 3:29:49.680
 And most people probably drop out through that system because the fight is just not worth it for them.

3:29:49.680 --> 3:29:50.680
 Yeah.

3:29:50.680 --> 3:29:56.680
 When you have the light in your eye, when you have the excitement for the thing, what happens is you start to surround yourself with others.

3:29:56.680 --> 3:29:58.680
 They're interested in that same thing that also have the light.

3:29:58.680 --> 3:30:03.680
 If you really are rigorous about this, because I think it does take...

3:30:03.680 --> 3:30:06.680
 It takes effort to make...

3:30:06.680 --> 3:30:08.680
 Oh, you've got to be obsessive.

3:30:08.680 --> 3:30:12.680
 But if you're doing what you really love doing, then it's not work anymore, it's what you do.

3:30:12.680 --> 3:30:17.680
 Yeah, but I also mean the surrounding yourself with other people that are obsessed about the same thing.

3:30:17.680 --> 3:30:18.680
 Because depending on...

3:30:18.680 --> 3:30:20.680
 Oh, that takes some work as well, yes.

3:30:20.680 --> 3:30:21.680
 And luck.

3:30:21.680 --> 3:30:24.680
 Finding the right mentors, the collaborators.

3:30:24.680 --> 3:30:34.680
 Because I think one of the problems with the PhD process is people are not careful enough in picking their mentors.

3:30:34.680 --> 3:30:37.680
 Those are people, mentors and colleagues and so on.

3:30:37.680 --> 3:30:43.680
 Those are people are going to define the direction of your life, how much you love a thing.

3:30:43.680 --> 3:30:51.680
 I mean, the power of just the few little conversations you have in the hallway, it's incredible.

3:30:51.680 --> 3:30:54.680
 So you have to be a little bit careful in that.

3:30:54.680 --> 3:30:57.680
 Sometimes you just get randomly almost assigned.

3:30:57.680 --> 3:31:06.680
 Really pursue, I suppose, the subject as much as you pursue the people that do that subject.

3:31:06.680 --> 3:31:08.680
 So both, the whole dance of it.

3:31:08.680 --> 3:31:10.680
 They kind of go together really.

3:31:10.680 --> 3:31:11.680
 Yeah, they really do.

3:31:11.680 --> 3:31:14.680
 But take that part seriously.

3:31:14.680 --> 3:31:18.680
 And probably in the way you're describing it,

3:31:18.680 --> 3:31:21.680
 careful how you define success.

3:31:21.680 --> 3:31:24.680
 You'll never find happiness in success.

3:31:24.680 --> 3:31:28.680
 There's a lovely quote from Robert Louis Stevenson, I think, who said,

3:31:28.680 --> 3:31:32.680
 nothing in life is so disenchanting as attainment.

3:31:32.680 --> 3:31:43.680
 Yeah, so I mean, in some sense, the true definition of success is getting to do today what you really enjoy doing.

3:31:43.680 --> 3:31:46.680
 Just what fills you with joy.

3:31:46.680 --> 3:31:47.680
 And that's ultimately success.

3:31:47.680 --> 3:31:54.680
 Success isn't the thing beyond the horizon, the big trophy, the financials.

3:31:54.680 --> 3:31:57.680
 I think it's as close as we can get to happiness.

3:31:57.680 --> 3:32:03.680
 That's not to say you're full of joy all the time, but it's as close as we can get to a sustained human happiness

3:32:03.680 --> 3:32:06.680
 is by getting some fulfillment from what you're doing on a daily basis.

3:32:06.680 --> 3:32:15.680
 And if what you're looking for is the world giving you the stamp of approval with a Nobel Prize or a fellowship or whatever it is,

3:32:15.680 --> 3:32:26.680
 then I've known people like this who they're eaten away by the anger and kind of caustic resentment

3:32:26.680 --> 3:32:30.680
 that they've not been awarded this prize that they deserve.

3:32:30.680 --> 3:32:34.680
 And the other way, if you put too much value into those kinds of prizes and you win them,

3:32:34.680 --> 3:32:45.680
 I've got the chance to see that it also, the more, quote unquote, successful you are in that sense,

3:32:45.680 --> 3:32:55.680
 the more you run the danger of growing an ego so big that you don't get to actually enjoy the beauty of this life.

3:32:55.680 --> 3:33:00.680
 You start to believe that you figured it all out as opposed to, I think,

3:33:00.680 --> 3:33:05.680
 but ultimately the most fun thing is being curious about everything around you, being constantly surprised

3:33:05.680 --> 3:33:11.680
 and these little moments of discovery of enjoying beauty in small and big ways all around you.

3:33:11.680 --> 3:33:17.680
 And I think the bigger your ego grows, the more you start to take yourself seriously, the less you're able to enjoy that.

3:33:17.680 --> 3:33:20.680
 Oh man, I couldn't agree more.

3:33:20.680 --> 3:33:31.680
 So, you know, the summary from harmless to mostly harmless in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, how would you try to summarize Earth?

3:33:31.680 --> 3:33:38.680
 And, you know, if you were given, if you had to summarize the whole thing in a couple of sentences,

3:33:38.680 --> 3:33:45.680
 and maybe throwing meaning of life in there, like why, why, why?

3:33:45.680 --> 3:33:52.680
 Is that a defining thing about humans that we care about the meaning of the whole thing?

3:33:52.680 --> 3:33:58.680
 I wonder if that should be part of the, these creatures seem to be very lost.

3:33:58.680 --> 3:34:00.680
 Yes, I'm not always asking why.

3:34:00.680 --> 3:34:06.680
 I mean, that's my defining question is why people used to make a joke.

3:34:06.680 --> 3:34:10.680
 I have a small scar on my forehead from a climbing accident years ago,

3:34:10.680 --> 3:34:15.680
 and the guy I was climbing with had dislodged a rock and he shouted something.

3:34:15.680 --> 3:34:18.680
 He shouted below, I think, meaning that the rock was coming down.

3:34:18.680 --> 3:34:23.680
 And I hadn't caught what he said, so I looked up and it smashed straight on my forehead.

3:34:23.680 --> 3:34:32.680
 And everybody around me took the piss saying he looked up to ask why.

3:34:32.680 --> 3:34:34.680
 Yeah, but that's a human imperative.

3:34:34.680 --> 3:34:36.680
 That's part of what it means to be human.

3:34:36.680 --> 3:34:41.680
 Look up to the sky and ask why.

3:34:41.680 --> 3:34:48.680
 So your question, define the earth.

3:34:48.680 --> 3:34:50.680
 I'm not sure I can do that.

3:34:50.680 --> 3:34:54.680
 I mean, the first word that comes to mind is living.

3:34:54.680 --> 3:34:57.680
 I wouldn't like to say mostly living, but perhaps.

3:34:57.680 --> 3:34:58.680
 Mostly living?

3:34:58.680 --> 3:35:04.680
 Well, it's interesting because if you were to write the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

3:35:04.680 --> 3:35:09.680
 I suppose, say our idea that we talked about,

3:35:09.680 --> 3:35:17.680
 that bacteria is the most prominent form of life throughout the galaxy and the universe.

3:35:17.680 --> 3:35:21.680
 I suppose that earth would be kind of unique and would require...

3:35:21.680 --> 3:35:23.680
 It's always abundance in that case.

3:35:23.680 --> 3:35:24.680
 Yeah.

3:35:24.680 --> 3:35:25.680
 It's profligate.

3:35:25.680 --> 3:35:26.680
 It's rich.

3:35:26.680 --> 3:35:29.680
 It's enormously living.

3:35:29.680 --> 3:35:32.680
 So how would you describe that it's not bacteria?

3:35:32.680 --> 3:35:37.680
 It's eukaryotic.

3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:38.680
 Yeah.

3:35:38.680 --> 3:35:42.680
 Well, I mean, that's the technical term, but it is basically it's...

3:35:42.680 --> 3:35:46.680
 Yeah, and then...

3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:47.680
 How would I describe that?

3:35:47.680 --> 3:35:53.680
 I've actually really struggled with that term because the word...

3:35:53.680 --> 3:35:57.680
 I mean, there's few words quite as good as eukaryotic to put everybody off immediately.

3:35:57.680 --> 3:36:00.680
 You start using words like that and they'll leave the room.

3:36:00.680 --> 3:36:04.680
 Krebs cycle is another one that gets people to leave the room.

3:36:04.680 --> 3:36:10.680
 But I've tried to think, is there another word for eukaryotic that I can use?

3:36:10.680 --> 3:36:13.680
 And really the only word that I've been able to use is complex.

3:36:13.680 --> 3:36:18.680
 Complex cells, complex life and so on.

3:36:18.680 --> 3:36:25.680
 And that word, it serves one immediate purpose, which is to convey an impression.

3:36:25.680 --> 3:36:33.680
 But then it means so many different things just everybody that actually is lost immediately.

3:36:33.680 --> 3:36:35.680
 And so it's kind of...

3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:39.680
 Well, that's unnoticeable from the perspective of other planets.

3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:46.680
 That is the noticeable phase transition of complexity is the eukaryotic.

3:36:46.680 --> 3:36:49.680
 What about the harmless and the mostly harmless?

3:36:49.680 --> 3:36:51.680
 Is that kind of...

3:36:51.680 --> 3:36:54.680
 Probably accurate on a universal kind of scale.

3:36:54.680 --> 3:37:01.680
 I don't think that humanity is in any danger of disturbing the universe at the moment.

3:37:01.680 --> 3:37:07.680
 At the moment, which is why the mostly, we don't know, depends on what Elon is up to.

3:37:07.680 --> 3:37:09.680
 Depends on how many rockets.

3:37:09.680 --> 3:37:10.680
 I think...

3:37:10.680 --> 3:37:17.680
 It'll be still even then a while, I think, before we disturb the fabric of time and space.

3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:29.680
 What was the aforementioned Andre Carpathia, I think he summarized Earth as a system where you hammer it with a bunch of photons.

3:37:29.680 --> 3:37:33.680
 The input is like photons and the output is rockets.

3:37:33.680 --> 3:37:36.680
 See if you just...

3:37:36.680 --> 3:37:39.680
 Well, that's the hell of a lot of photons before there was a rocket.

3:37:39.680 --> 3:37:45.680
 Yeah, but maybe in the span of the universe, it's not that much time.

3:37:45.680 --> 3:37:52.680
 And so, and I do wonder what the future is, whether we're just in the early beginnings of this Earth,

3:37:52.680 --> 3:37:57.680
 which is important when you try to summarize it, or we're at the end,

3:37:57.680 --> 3:38:05.680
 where humans have finally gained the ability to destroy the entirety of this beautiful project we've got going on.

3:38:05.680 --> 3:38:10.680
 That with nuclear weapons, with engineered viruses, with all those kinds of things.

3:38:10.680 --> 3:38:15.680
 That's inadvertently through global warming and pollution and so on.

3:38:15.680 --> 3:38:16.680
 We're quite capable of that.

3:38:16.680 --> 3:38:18.680
 I mean, we just need to pass the tipping point.

3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:24.680
 I mean, I think we're more likely to do it inadvertently than through a nuclear war, which could happen at any time.

3:38:24.680 --> 3:38:33.680
 But my fear is we just don't know where the tipping points are and we will...

3:38:33.680 --> 3:38:37.680
 We kind of think we're smart enough to fix the problem quickly if we really need to.

3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:42.680
 I think that's the overriding assumption that we're all right for now.

3:38:42.680 --> 3:38:45.680
 Maybe in 20 years time, it's going to be a calamitous problem

3:38:45.680 --> 3:38:49.680
 and then we'll really need to put some serious mental power into fixing it

3:38:49.680 --> 3:38:53.680
 without seriously worrying that perhaps that is too late

3:38:53.680 --> 3:38:59.680
 and that however brilliant we are, we miss the boat.

3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:01.680
 And just walk off the cliff.

3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:02.680
 I don't know.

3:39:02.680 --> 3:39:05.680
 I have optimism in humans being clever descendants.

3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:08.680
 Oh, I have no doubt that we can fix the problem.

3:39:08.680 --> 3:39:10.680
 It's an urgent problem.

3:39:10.680 --> 3:39:13.680
 We need to fix it pretty sharpish.

3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:18.680
 And I do have doubts about whether politically we are capable of coming together enough

3:39:18.680 --> 3:39:23.680
 to not just in any one country but around the planet.

3:39:23.680 --> 3:39:26.680
 I mean, I know we can do it, but do we have the will?

3:39:26.680 --> 3:39:30.680
 Do we have the vision to accomplish it?

3:39:30.680 --> 3:39:33.680
 That's what makes this whole ride fun.

3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:38.680
 I don't know. Not only do we not know if we can handle the crises before us,

3:39:38.680 --> 3:39:43.680
 we don't even know all the crises that are going to be before us in the next 20 years.

3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:49.680
 The ones I think that will most likely challenge us in the 21st century

3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:51.680
 are the ones we don't even expect.

3:39:51.680 --> 3:39:55.680
 People didn't expect World War II at the end of World War I.

3:39:55.680 --> 3:39:58.680
 Some folks do, but not at the end of World War I,

3:39:58.680 --> 3:40:02.680
 but by the late 1920s, I think people were beginning to worry about it.

3:40:02.680 --> 3:40:05.680
 Yeah, no, there's always people worrying about everything.

3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:07.680
 So if you focus on the thing that...

3:40:07.680 --> 3:40:09.680
 People worry about, yes.

3:40:09.680 --> 3:40:11.680
 Because there's a million things people worry about,

3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:14.680
 and 99.999999% of them don't come to be.

3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:16.680
 Of course, the people that turn out to be right,

3:40:16.680 --> 3:40:20.680
 they'll say, I knew all along, but that's not an accurate way of knowing

3:40:20.680 --> 3:40:22.680
 what you could have predicted.

3:40:22.680 --> 3:40:25.680
 I think rationally speaking, you can worry about it,

3:40:25.680 --> 3:40:27.680
 but nobody thought you could have another World War.

3:40:27.680 --> 3:40:29.680
 The war to end all wars.

3:40:29.680 --> 3:40:31.680
 Why would you have another war?

3:40:31.680 --> 3:40:35.680
 The idea of nuclear weapons, just technologically,

3:40:35.680 --> 3:40:38.680
 is a very difficult thing to anticipate.

3:40:38.680 --> 3:40:41.680
 To create a weapon that just jumps orders of magnitude

3:40:41.680 --> 3:40:43.680
 and destructive capability.

3:40:43.680 --> 3:40:47.680
 And of course, we can intuit all the things like engineered viruses,

3:40:47.680 --> 3:40:51.680
 nanobots, artificial intelligence,

3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:56.680
 yes, all the different complicated global effects of global warming.

3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:00.680
 So how that changes the allocation of resources, the flow of energy,

3:41:00.680 --> 3:41:02.680
 the tension between countries,

3:41:02.680 --> 3:41:04.680
 the military conflict between countries,

3:41:04.680 --> 3:41:06.680
 the reallocation of power,

3:41:06.680 --> 3:41:09.680
 then looking at the role of China in this whole thing

3:41:09.680 --> 3:41:13.680
 with Russia and growing influence of Africa

3:41:13.680 --> 3:41:16.680
 and the weird dynamics of Europe.

3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:19.680
 And then America falling apart through the political division

3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:23.680
 fueled by recommender systems through Twitter and Facebook.

3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:26.680
 The whole beautiful mess is just fun.

3:41:26.680 --> 3:41:30.680
 And I think there's a lot of incredible engineers,

3:41:30.680 --> 3:41:32.680
 incredible scientists, incredible human beings

3:41:32.680 --> 3:41:35.680
 that while everyone is bickering and so on online

3:41:35.680 --> 3:41:37.680
 for the fun of it on the weekends,

3:41:37.680 --> 3:41:39.680
 they're actually trying to build solutions.

3:41:39.680 --> 3:41:42.680
 And those are the people that will create something beautiful.

3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:46.680
 At least I have, you know, that's the process of evolution.

3:41:46.680 --> 3:41:53.680
 It all started with a Chuck Norris single cell organism

3:41:53.680 --> 3:41:55.680
 that went out from the vents

3:41:55.680 --> 3:41:57.680
 and was the parent to all of us.

3:41:57.680 --> 3:42:01.680
 And for that guy or lady or both, I guess,

3:42:01.680 --> 3:42:05.680
 is a big thank you and I can't wait to what happens next.

3:42:05.680 --> 3:42:09.680
 And I'm glad there's incredible humans writing and studying it like you are.

3:42:09.680 --> 3:42:12.680
 Nick, it's a huge honor that you were talking to me.

3:42:12.680 --> 3:42:14.680
 This is really amazing.

3:42:14.680 --> 3:42:17.680
 I can't wait to read what you write next.

3:42:17.680 --> 3:42:19.680
 Thank you for existing.

3:42:19.680 --> 3:42:24.680
 And thank you for talking today.

3:42:24.680 --> 3:42:25.680
 Thank you.

3:42:25.680 --> 3:42:28.680
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Nick Lane.

3:42:32.680 --> 3:42:36.680
 And now let me leave you with some words from Steve Jobs.

3:42:36.680 --> 3:42:40.680
 I think the biggest innovations of the 21st century

3:42:40.680 --> 3:42:45.680
 will be at the intersection of biology and technology.

3:42:45.680 --> 3:42:48.680
 A new era is beginning.

3:42:48.680 --> 3:42:49.680
 Thank you for listening.

3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:55.680
 I hope to see you next time.
