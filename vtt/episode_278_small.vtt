WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
 We would come up to these rafts and these boats

00:05.120 --> 00:09.440
 that were in really dire shape and people would be pushed off

00:09.440 --> 00:11.760
 and people would jump off and people would fall

00:11.760 --> 00:16.760
 into the water and some of them couldn't swim.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.200
 And so we found ourselves in this moment

00:21.200 --> 00:23.040
 where we had a choice.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.240
 We could film someone drowned in front of us

00:26.240 --> 00:27.960
 or we could put our cameras down

00:27.960 --> 00:29.560
 and pull them out of the water.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.280
 The following is a conversation with Skyfus Gerald,

00:34.280 --> 00:37.240
 a two time Oscar nominated documentary filmmaker

00:37.240 --> 00:41.140
 who made the films Hunger Ward about the war in Yemen,

00:41.140 --> 00:44.080
 Life Boat about the search and rescue operations

00:44.080 --> 00:48.400
 off the coast of Libya and 50 feet from Syria

00:48.400 --> 00:50.280
 about the war in Syria.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.160
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:55.280 --> 00:56.480
 in the description.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.920
 Now dear friends, here's Skyfus Gerald.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.520
 Nearly 811 million people worldwide are hungry today

01:05.520 --> 01:08.440
 and 45 million people are on the edge of famine

01:08.440 --> 01:10.180
 across 43 countries.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.360
 How do you feel?

01:12.360 --> 01:14.680
 How do you make sense of that many people suffering

01:14.680 --> 01:17.280
 from hunger and famine in the world today?

01:17.280 --> 01:20.080
 I don't know if I can make sense of it, Lex.

01:20.080 --> 01:25.080
 I mean, I think it's deeply disturbing to me

01:25.080 --> 01:27.000
 that as a global community,

01:27.000 --> 01:31.320
 we've allowed this number of people to go hungry

01:31.320 --> 01:33.880
 when the food to feed them exists

01:33.880 --> 01:36.880
 and the resources to feed them exists.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.120
 I think the thing that disturbs me most

01:39.120 --> 01:43.680
 about those figures is that many of those

01:43.680 --> 01:47.720
 who are starving today or going hungry today

01:49.000 --> 01:53.360
 are the net result of war and intentional acts

01:53.360 --> 01:56.480
 by leaders to starve entire populations.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.480
 And that's the most deeply disturbing part to me.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.880
 You know your history and we all know that,

02:04.880 --> 02:09.880
 deeply embedded in the Geneva Conventions post World War II,

02:10.080 --> 02:11.640
 the intent of one of those articles

02:11.640 --> 02:15.640
 was to ban the use of starvation as a weapon of war

02:16.440 --> 02:19.920
 because of what Hitler did during World War II.

02:19.920 --> 02:24.120
 That's been reiterated multiple times over the years

02:24.120 --> 02:25.840
 in international humanitarian law,

02:25.840 --> 02:30.560
 including in 2018 because of the Saudi blockade over Yemen.

02:30.560 --> 02:34.400
 And yet to this day, starvation as a weapon of war

02:34.400 --> 02:36.920
 continues to be used in Ethiopia,

02:36.920 --> 02:39.080
 obviously in Ukraine right now,

02:39.080 --> 02:41.160
 and in Yemen with the blockade over the country.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.600
 And that disgusts me that the law is in place,

02:44.600 --> 02:46.960
 but it won't be enforced by the international bodies

02:46.960 --> 02:50.320
 and the nation states that make up the international community.

02:50.320 --> 02:55.040
 So when the starvation is a result of human actions,

02:55.040 --> 02:59.280
 human decisions that it's especially painful

02:59.280 --> 03:00.560
 to make sense of?

03:00.560 --> 03:02.520
 For me personally, yeah.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.520
 I think that if you and I sit in here didn't eat

03:05.520 --> 03:10.520
 for three days and had to lay our head on the sidewalk

03:11.360 --> 03:16.280
 for a couple nights, I think we would take hunger

03:16.280 --> 03:19.280
 and homelessness a lot more seriously.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.320
 And I think that's, for some reason,

03:22.320 --> 03:25.640
 that's missing at this moment in history tragically.

03:25.640 --> 03:29.240
 And I think until that we can generate enough empathy

03:30.240 --> 03:32.480
 that's immediate for all of us to understand

03:32.480 --> 03:34.200
 what that means to go hungry,

03:34.200 --> 03:36.560
 I'm not sure we're gonna sort of marshal

03:36.560 --> 03:39.560
 the global community to solve it.

03:39.560 --> 03:44.560
 I did just that, by the way, faster for three days recently.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.440
 It's fundamentally different, I think,

03:47.440 --> 03:51.920
 because the thing that would be terrifying to me

03:51.920 --> 03:54.120
 is not the fasting, but the hopelessness

03:54.120 --> 03:55.440
 at the end of the fast,

03:55.440 --> 03:58.840
 like I wouldn't know when the next meal is coming.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.440
 I always had the freedom to have the meal.

04:01.440 --> 04:06.360
 The fear, not just your own ability to eat

04:06.360 --> 04:08.960
 and survive, but your families, if there's loved ones,

04:08.960 --> 04:11.600
 that's the other thing I don't have, I'm single.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.880
 And so I feel like the worst suffering

04:14.880 --> 04:17.600
 is watching somebody you love

04:17.600 --> 04:20.080
 that you're supposed to be a caretaker of,

04:20.080 --> 04:21.800
 and you can't take care of them.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.200
 And if all of that is caused by leaders

04:28.760 --> 04:32.360
 in, as a weapon of war,

04:32.360 --> 04:35.600
 that is especially painful.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.800
 So how can we help?

04:39.800 --> 04:42.880
 What are the ways to help?

04:44.080 --> 04:46.480
 How do we alleviate this suffering?

04:48.360 --> 04:52.800
 Well, I think on the humanitarian front,

04:52.800 --> 04:56.520
 we have to be aggressive and attentive

04:56.520 --> 04:59.240
 and intervene in significant ways.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.720
 And I think on the political front,

05:01.720 --> 05:06.600
 we have to hold players accountable for their actions.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.320
 So the leaders that start the war,

05:08.320 --> 05:12.240
 so when you say, we have to speak up about the decisions

05:12.240 --> 05:14.160
 and the humans making those decisions

05:14.160 --> 05:15.520
 that lead to this situation.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.160
 For example, let's make it concrete.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.200
 So when I was, I don't wanna jump ahead,

05:20.200 --> 05:22.520
 but when I was filming Hunger Ward in Yemen,

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
 I met a mother who when she gave birth weighed 70 pounds,

05:32.120 --> 05:34.440
 the mother weighed 70 pounds.

05:34.440 --> 05:39.440
 And so her daughter was starved in the womb, right?

05:42.440 --> 05:46.600
 When she was born, she was born into a world

05:46.600 --> 05:50.160
 with no breast milk, very little formula, right?

05:50.160 --> 05:52.360
 So she was starved before birth.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.680
 She was born into a world

05:53.680 --> 05:56.680
 where she continued to be starved, right?

05:56.680 --> 06:00.040
 By a mother who herself was starved.

06:00.040 --> 06:04.840
 I watched that child, her name is Asila, die in front of me,

06:04.840 --> 06:05.880
 right?

06:05.880 --> 06:10.760
 Asila had no chance for all those things we hope for,

06:10.760 --> 06:12.600
 for a child in this world.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.440
 She didn't have a chance to grow up.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.760
 She didn't have a chance to discover love.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.080
 She didn't have a chance to have a career.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.240
 She was robbed of all of those things

06:22.240 --> 06:24.480
 because of the insidious nature of hunger

06:24.480 --> 06:26.360
 that she was born into.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.640
 She didn't have to die.

06:28.640 --> 06:32.200
 She was not starving.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.880
 She, her mother was being starved, right?

06:34.880 --> 06:37.120
 Because of the blockade over the country.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.880
 Now who instituted that blockade?

06:39.800 --> 06:43.920
 MBS in Saudi Arabia with the reinforcement

06:43.920 --> 06:46.440
 and sort of tacit approval of the United States,

06:46.440 --> 06:48.560
 our own government here.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.440
 And so there are people who are responsible

06:51.440 --> 06:52.880
 for the starvation of children.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.600
 And I think we need to hold them accountable.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.600
 Now that's incredibly difficult to do.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.240
 But just because it's difficult

07:00.240 --> 07:02.560
 doesn't mean it ought not to be done.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.920
 And we'll talk about many cases like these

07:06.920 --> 07:09.040
 throughout history and going on today.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.520
 Let's talk about hunger ward.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.360
 Let's dive in.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.920
 You've been nominated for an Oscar twice.

07:14.920 --> 07:19.520
 This is one of the times for a documentary.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.240
 Can you please tell me what hunger ward,

07:24.240 --> 07:27.440
 the last hope between war and starvation is about?

07:27.440 --> 07:29.640
 Hunger ward is a short documentary

07:31.120 --> 07:35.680
 that really is an attempt to illustrate the effects

07:35.680 --> 07:40.240
 of the conflict on Yemen, specifically on civilians.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.800
 And we document it in both the North

07:43.800 --> 07:44.800
 and the South of the country

07:44.800 --> 07:46.760
 because it's a bifurcated country.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.280
 The South is held by the globally recognized government

07:50.280 --> 07:52.400
 in the South, which up until last week

07:52.400 --> 07:57.400
 was run by, at least on the surface by President Hadi,

07:58.360 --> 08:00.120
 hold up in Riyadh.

08:00.120 --> 08:05.120
 He was essentially removed from office last week

08:05.240 --> 08:08.440
 by most people would agree,

08:08.440 --> 08:10.480
 the Emiratis and the Saudis

08:10.480 --> 08:12.720
 to put in place a presidential council.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.480
 So we wanted to show that starvation was happening

08:16.480 --> 08:19.760
 in very similar fashions, both in the South and the North.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.480
 So, and we wanted to do this film

08:22.480 --> 08:27.280
 because so few people in the West know anything

08:27.280 --> 08:29.080
 about the conflict in Yemen,

08:29.080 --> 08:32.720
 nor the US's complicity in it.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.320
 And so my intent with the project

08:34.320 --> 08:36.760
 was try to bring it to a larger Western audience

08:36.760 --> 08:38.400
 as an attempt to intervene

08:38.400 --> 08:40.200
 and change the political status quo,

08:40.200 --> 08:44.600
 which allows the use of starvation in Yemen to continue.

08:44.600 --> 08:49.240
 So US complicity, who are the bad guys?

08:49.240 --> 08:53.560
 Now, the world unfortunately cannot be painted

08:53.560 --> 08:56.720
 in black and white of good guys and bad guys.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.680
 But for the purpose of conversation,

08:59.680 --> 09:04.400
 who is doing, causing suffering in the world

09:04.400 --> 09:05.960
 in this situation?

09:05.960 --> 09:07.400
 Well, who started the war?

09:07.400 --> 09:08.240
 Why?

09:09.560 --> 09:14.400
 And then of course, the roots of war go back in history.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.640
 But let's start at the top.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.320
 Well, there are bad actors and there are less bad actors,

09:20.320 --> 09:21.160
 right?

09:21.160 --> 09:22.920
 I mean, I think that's always the case in war, probably.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.600
 And everybody loses in war.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.160
 Yeah, I concur with that statement.

09:28.080 --> 09:33.160
 In the case of sort of the status quo in Yemen right now,

09:33.160 --> 09:36.080
 it's a completely asymmetrical war.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.160
 And so the Saudi coalition,

09:38.160 --> 09:41.360
 which is made up of primarily Saudi Arabia,

09:41.360 --> 09:46.360
 the Emirates, United States, France, Britain,

09:46.360 --> 09:49.360
 supplying weapons, but it's really driven

09:49.360 --> 09:51.440
 and catalyzed by Saudi Arabia.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.000
 And it's asymmetrical to a great extent

09:55.000 --> 09:58.800
 just because of the incredible firepower by air

09:58.800 --> 10:02.120
 that the Saudis use continuously

10:02.120 --> 10:03.880
 to pummel northern Yemen.

10:04.840 --> 10:09.080
 When I was there, the sheer volume of airstrikes

10:09.080 --> 10:10.760
 is hard to describe.

10:10.760 --> 10:14.920
 And we show the result of only one in the film, really.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.320
 But it's an asymmetrical war,

10:16.320 --> 10:19.240
 the de facto authorities of the north on Surallah,

10:19.240 --> 10:21.920
 also known as the Houthi rebel group.

10:21.920 --> 10:25.200
 They don't have an air force, right?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.720
 They have a drone force, but they don't have an air force.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.920
 And so it's a, from a military standpoint,

10:29.920 --> 10:31.880
 it's completely asymmetrical.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.640
 The Saudis really don't commit troops to the ground.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.200
 They use only proxies to fight on the ground.

10:37.200 --> 10:42.200
 What is the narrative they use to justify a war?

10:42.200 --> 10:46.320
 So there's a story on every side in war.

10:46.320 --> 10:49.040
 Some of it is grounded in truth.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.000
 Some of it is not at all grounded in truth,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.040
 also known as propaganda.

10:54.040 --> 10:58.400
 What's the narrative used by the Saudis for this war?

10:58.400 --> 11:00.880
 The Saudi line is essentially that

11:00.880 --> 11:03.160
 the Houthis are an illegitimate government.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.480
 And that it's really a proxy war

11:07.480 --> 11:10.600
 between Iran, who supports the Houthis nominally.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.240
 And the rest of the world.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.920
 That's the Saudi narrative.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.280
 The reality is something altogether different.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.600
 While the Houthis do receive support from Iran,

11:20.600 --> 11:24.760
 this is a war started by and sustained by MBS

11:24.760 --> 11:25.920
 in Saudi Arabia.

11:25.920 --> 11:26.760
 Who's MBS?

11:26.760 --> 11:28.360
 Muhammad bin Salman.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.280
 And who is he?

11:29.280 --> 11:33.160
 He is the son of the ruler of Saudi Arabia.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.680
 What's his power?

11:34.680 --> 11:36.680
 I'm asking basic dumb question.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.320
 He's the de facto ruler.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.000
 Of the military and the...

11:40.000 --> 11:43.880
 Yes, he seized control of the country several years ago.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.760
 Even though he, on the surface,

11:45.760 --> 11:47.840
 is not the rule of Saudi Arabia, he is.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.680
 He's the crown prince.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.080
 And sorry to interrupt often,

11:50.080 --> 11:53.760
 but who is he as a man?

11:53.760 --> 11:54.720
 What's your sense of the...

11:54.720 --> 11:56.640
 Yeah, so I've never met him.

11:56.640 --> 11:59.640
 And I likely will never meet him, hopefully.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.600
 But he is, I know a lot about him through his actions,

12:04.600 --> 12:06.600
 sort of in the Mina region,

12:06.600 --> 12:08.920
 Middle Eastern, North Africa region.

12:08.920 --> 12:13.000
 And he is one of three, in my view,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.400
 as an American sitting here in the US.

12:15.400 --> 12:19.000
 Three people in the world that I think

12:19.000 --> 12:23.880
 has caused such an incredible volume of misery

12:23.880 --> 12:27.640
 and suffering and murder on this planet

12:27.640 --> 12:32.640
 that I think if he weren't around,

12:34.320 --> 12:35.920
 the world would be a lot better place.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.000
 And I'm not a violent person by nature,

12:38.000 --> 12:39.600
 but there are three human beings

12:39.600 --> 12:43.160
 that I think the world would be better off without.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.840
 Do you mind, before I ask other questions,

12:45.840 --> 12:47.280
 mentioning the three?

12:47.280 --> 12:50.400
 Oh yeah, Assad is one in Syria.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.240
 And that comes out of an earlier project

12:52.240 --> 12:54.520
 that I did in Syria and Turkey.

12:54.520 --> 12:59.520
 And what I saw Assad as a ruler do to his own people,

13:01.680 --> 13:04.000
 and Putin would be the third.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
 Those three human beings are murderers on a scale

13:09.160 --> 13:11.600
 beyond imagining.

13:11.600 --> 13:16.120
 On MBS, are you able to think as a documentary filmmaker,

13:16.120 --> 13:19.040
 as a human beings, a scholar, as a thinker,

13:19.040 --> 13:22.040
 with an open mind about a man like that

13:22.040 --> 13:23.800
 who does evil onto the world?

13:23.800 --> 13:25.960
 And what that must feel like

13:25.960 --> 13:28.040
 to be inside the mind of that man.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.720
 So basically, consider his worldview.

13:31.720 --> 13:35.280
 With most evil people, with all people probably,

13:35.280 --> 13:37.960
 but with people who do evil onto the world,

13:37.960 --> 13:40.160
 they think they're doing good.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.560
 They're the hero of their own story.

13:41.560 --> 13:45.120
 Right, and so to be able to place yourself,

13:45.120 --> 13:47.840
 I feel like, for me, to understand a person,

13:47.840 --> 13:51.160
 I have to literally, like the way actors

13:51.160 --> 13:55.680
 kind of have to live inside the body

13:55.680 --> 13:57.200
 of the person they're trying to study.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.160
 Inhabit the character.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.600
 Inhabit the person.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.520
 So are you able to do that, or because you

14:03.640 --> 14:06.640
 are also studying the people who suffer

14:06.640 --> 14:10.040
 as a result, as a consequence of their actions,

14:10.040 --> 14:13.520
 you just, you put them in a box and you say,

14:13.520 --> 14:17.840
 I hate the person in that box, I'm going to move on.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.680
 This goes back to your black and white statement

14:19.680 --> 14:20.720
 at the beginning, right?

14:20.720 --> 14:24.280
 It's like, the world as a whole, of course,

14:24.280 --> 14:26.920
 is every gradation of gray, right?

14:26.920 --> 14:29.040
 My background is theater, Lex.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.400
 And so I was trained long before I picked up a camera

14:32.400 --> 14:34.200
 to inhabit other characters, right?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.160
 I have two degrees in theater.

14:36.160 --> 14:39.040
 And so that level of sort of like walking

14:39.040 --> 14:41.360
 in other people's shoes and trying to understand

14:41.360 --> 14:44.160
 and empathize with their world view

14:44.160 --> 14:46.400
 is fundamental to how I live my life

14:46.400 --> 14:47.960
 and how I do my work.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.160
 So in the case of those three that I named,

14:50.160 --> 14:53.520
 Assad, MBS and Putin, yeah, I can go there

14:53.520 --> 14:57.760
 and think through how they came to be who they are, right?

14:57.760 --> 14:59.320
 From afar, right?

14:59.320 --> 15:01.880
 And after I go through that process,

15:02.720 --> 15:04.920
 I still don't think there's any way

15:04.920 --> 15:08.520
 that one can justify what they've done.

15:10.040 --> 15:14.400
 We're going to talk about each of those people, for sure.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.920
 Well, I'm not an expert on any of them.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.880
 You're a human being, which makes you

15:20.200 --> 15:23.280
 a partial expert on human nature,

15:23.280 --> 15:24.400
 because nobody's an expert.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.320
 You're just as good as anyone else.

15:26.320 --> 15:30.200
 Anybody who actually cares a camera and listens

15:30.200 --> 15:32.560
 and observe others isn't especially

15:32.560 --> 15:34.120
 an expert of human nature.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.520
 It's willing to take that leap

15:37.520 --> 15:41.280
 and truly understand somebody of any level, not leaders.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.640
 If you like to understand a leader,

15:42.640 --> 15:45.000
 you have to first understand humans.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.120
 And to understand humans, you have to see humans

15:47.120 --> 15:49.560
 that they're worse than they're best,

15:49.560 --> 15:52.240
 which is something that you've definitely done.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.400
 So let's stick on hunger ward.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.840
 This lens that you've chosen to look at this

15:56.840 --> 16:00.520
 is through a single, maybe you can speak to that.

16:00.520 --> 16:05.520
 You've mentioned the starvation as a result of war.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.680
 What is the documentary?

16:08.680 --> 16:13.440
 What is the lens you've chosen to give the world a peak

16:13.440 --> 16:15.360
 at the results, at the suffering

16:15.360 --> 16:16.960
 that's a result of this war?

16:18.040 --> 16:19.720
 People a lot of times will ask me

16:19.720 --> 16:21.320
 after they've seen hunger ward,

16:21.320 --> 16:26.320
 they ask where the hope is, right?

16:26.720 --> 16:30.680
 You read the byline earlier, The Last Hope.

16:32.240 --> 16:37.240
 And what I try to focus on in many of my films,

16:37.360 --> 16:42.360
 including hunger ward is in the very difficult context

16:42.640 --> 16:47.680
 of war as the cases in hunger ward in Yemen,

16:47.680 --> 16:50.320
 I look for hope and I look for inspiration

16:50.320 --> 16:54.240
 and I do that through people who are doing incredible things

16:54.240 --> 16:56.680
 under the most difficult circumstances.

16:56.680 --> 17:01.680
 So when I set out to do a film about starvation in Yemen,

17:03.480 --> 17:06.200
 right, I mean, just listen to that statement,

17:06.200 --> 17:08.000
 where's the hope there, right?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.440
 And yet what I found, what I discovered

17:11.440 --> 17:14.320
 were human beings that we could tell the story through

17:14.320 --> 17:18.000
 who are incredible, inspirational human beings

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
 doing amazing things every day.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.840
 One of those is Makia Mahji,

17:23.840 --> 17:25.840
 a nurse practitioner in the north of the country

17:25.840 --> 17:27.400
 at a small rural clinic.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.080
 And another is Dr. Ayed Al Sadiq,

17:30.080 --> 17:33.040
 who is a pediatrician in the south of the country.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.040
 And so we chose to tell the story sort of

17:35.040 --> 17:38.360
 through their experiences as caregivers,

17:38.360 --> 17:43.360
 devoting their lives to try to save this entire cohort,

17:43.360 --> 17:45.760
 this entire generation of children

17:45.760 --> 17:48.800
 that has been born into starvation.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.040
 And that's an incredible, difficult task,

17:52.040 --> 17:56.480
 but equally inspirational to watch these human beings

17:56.480 --> 18:00.440
 devote every minute of every day to save a child.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.440
 I mean, in my view, nothing is more important

18:03.440 --> 18:04.440
 than that action.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.160
 Maybe on that point real quick.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.400
 So there is suffering at scale, starvation at scale,

18:11.400 --> 18:16.400
 there's, I mean, the numbers, maybe you can mention in Yemen

18:17.080 --> 18:19.400
 what are the numbers in terms of people in starvation,

18:19.400 --> 18:24.200
 but from a perspective of a nurse practitioner or a doctor,

18:24.200 --> 18:26.080
 you're always have, you're treating one person

18:26.080 --> 18:26.920
 in front of you.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.360
 So how do you make sense of that calculus

18:31.360 --> 18:35.120
 of like there's a huge number of people suffering,

18:35.120 --> 18:37.520
 and then there's just the person in front of you?

18:37.520 --> 18:42.520
 Is that all we can do as humans

18:43.160 --> 18:45.480
 is just to help one person at a time?

18:45.480 --> 18:49.480
 Is that the right way to think and to approach these problems

18:49.480 --> 18:52.760
 or can you actually make sense of the numbers?

18:52.760 --> 18:55.000
 Speaking just as a human being,

18:55.000 --> 18:58.560
 I think the scale of suffering is so great in Yemen

18:59.760 --> 19:04.760
 that I think I'd be overwhelmed, right?

19:04.760 --> 19:08.160
 If I focused on that scale, you know,

19:08.160 --> 19:10.480
 you've probably heard that, you know,

19:10.480 --> 19:15.120
 a child dies every 75 seconds in Yemen from hunger, right?

19:15.120 --> 19:17.160
 So we've been sitting here how long,

19:17.160 --> 19:18.800
 you know, 35 minutes or so.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.280
 That's a good handful of children

19:21.280 --> 19:23.440
 that have already passed away.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.560
 So to overcome sort of, I think that danger

19:26.560 --> 19:28.960
 of psychic numbing, which can happen

19:28.960 --> 19:32.480
 when you think about suffering on such a large scale,

19:32.480 --> 19:35.160
 as a filmmaker, as a human being,

19:35.160 --> 19:37.000
 I have to focus in on the individuals

19:37.000 --> 19:39.160
 on those human beings in front of me.

19:39.160 --> 19:42.160
 And I think that's exactly what Dr. Al Sadiq and Makia do

19:42.160 --> 19:43.840
 to keep going each day.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.200
 And one of the amazing things

19:45.200 --> 19:48.200
 about these two healthcare providers

19:48.200 --> 19:49.440
 that we showcase in the film

19:49.440 --> 19:54.160
 is that they treat anyone who shows up, right?

19:54.160 --> 19:56.200
 They don't have to have money.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.640
 They don't have to have any resources.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.520
 They just have to get to the clinic or the hospital.

20:00.520 --> 20:05.520
 And it's incredibly moving to see sort of the flexibility

20:05.960 --> 20:09.200
 of their thinking in terms of how they make that work.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.640
 Makia, for example, I saw her in the north of the country.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.800
 So incredibly rural clinic that she works at.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.480
 And so it's like a magnet for all the cases

20:17.480 --> 20:18.880
 in the north of the country.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.920
 People come from hundreds of kilometers away sometimes

20:21.920 --> 20:25.840
 for specialty treatment of pediatric malnutrition.

20:25.840 --> 20:29.080
 And one time I saw a child come in

20:29.080 --> 20:33.360
 and it was a male relative that brought this young girl in.

20:33.360 --> 20:38.360
 And just because of sort of the gender dynamics in Yemen,

20:38.960 --> 20:42.400
 there had to be a parent or a relative there

20:42.400 --> 20:44.280
 to stay with the child while they're at the clinic.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.880
 And it was a male relative.

20:45.880 --> 20:50.240
 And so what many doctors in that instance would do

20:50.240 --> 20:51.720
 would just turn them away.

20:51.720 --> 20:55.160
 And instead what Makia did is she walked into one of the rooms,

20:55.160 --> 20:56.600
 talked to one of the other mothers

20:56.600 --> 20:59.320
 and convinced them to become the temporary guardian,

20:59.320 --> 21:04.320
 essentially of this child until a female relative could arrive.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.120
 So, you know, she's flexible.

21:06.120 --> 21:09.280
 She finds solutions rather than allowing the problems

21:09.280 --> 21:10.960
 to deter solutions.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.120
 One child at a time.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.880
 Yeah, yeah, one child at a time.

21:16.320 --> 21:21.320
 You mentioned that you saw a child die in front of you.

21:21.320 --> 21:26.320
 So when you're filming this as a filmmaker, what's that like?

21:29.240 --> 21:34.240
 Psychologically, philosophically, creatively as a filmmaker,

21:35.520 --> 21:36.640
 as a storyteller.

21:39.720 --> 21:40.880
 What do you do there?

21:40.880 --> 21:43.920
 As a human and as a filmmaker?

21:43.920 --> 21:45.880
 Well, what's that whole experience like?

21:45.880 --> 21:47.480
 Because you get to, like you said,

21:47.480 --> 21:49.720
 you take it through the whole journey

21:49.720 --> 21:52.640
 of a starving mother giving birth to a starving child.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.280
 It's not something I want to film.

21:57.440 --> 22:01.720
 It's not something that I certainly wanted to happen

22:01.720 --> 22:05.000
 or seek out, but it happened.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.720
 And the sad truth is that it happens every week

22:07.720 --> 22:09.200
 at that hospital.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.960
 And so when it happened in this instance,

22:12.960 --> 22:17.400
 I felt an incredible responsibility to do justice

22:17.400 --> 22:21.280
 to that reality, to acknowledge that a child

22:21.280 --> 22:24.840
 had just died of starvation related causes.

22:27.040 --> 22:31.840
 And to find some way, if the parents wanted us to,

22:31.840 --> 22:34.520
 to integrate that into this story,

22:34.520 --> 22:39.400
 we'd bring back to a Western audience.

22:39.400 --> 22:49.400
 And I've filmed many difficult things over the years.

22:49.480 --> 22:54.280
 And usually I really love filming.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.400
 And I didn't love filming Hunger Ward.

22:56.400 --> 23:00.400
 It was not a process that I enjoyed

23:00.400 --> 23:04.240
 on any way to perform, sadly, because of the content.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.880
 Because who wants to watch a child die in front of them?

23:06.880 --> 23:08.840
 I don't, but I did.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.120
 And I had to.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.960
 And when that happened,

23:11.960 --> 23:16.960
 I felt an incredible responsibility again to go deep, right?

23:17.240 --> 23:19.200
 To go deep with that family,

23:19.200 --> 23:22.000
 to tell the story of this hospital

23:23.040 --> 23:27.440
 with every ounce of focus and talent

23:27.440 --> 23:28.760
 that I could bring to the story,

23:28.760 --> 23:33.440
 because people should know that children

23:33.440 --> 23:36.120
 are dying of starvation right now as we sit here.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.960
 And that that doesn't have to happen.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.280
 And it is happening because of political dynamics

23:40.280 --> 23:42.680
 that we can intervene on.

23:42.680 --> 23:46.760
 Is there times you wanted to walk away,

23:46.760 --> 23:51.240
 quit the telling of the story,

23:51.240 --> 23:54.720
 come back to the United States,

23:54.720 --> 24:03.520
 where you can just appreciate the wonderful comfort

24:03.520 --> 24:07.360
 you can have just sitting there and having food.

24:07.360 --> 24:12.520
 And freedom to do whatever you want,

24:12.520 --> 24:13.880
 those kinds of things.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.640
 Doesn't have to be United States,

24:15.640 --> 24:17.600
 in a lot of places in the world.

24:17.600 --> 24:21.040
 Well, that dynamic of sort of like survivor's guilt,

24:21.040 --> 24:23.880
 you know, on some level definitely exists.

24:23.880 --> 24:24.840
 One of the hardest things,

24:24.840 --> 24:28.960
 well, from Hungry Ward actually was eating, right?

24:28.960 --> 24:31.280
 Because we were in these malnutrition clinics,

24:31.280 --> 24:34.440
 they're called TFCs, therapeutic feeding centers,

24:34.440 --> 24:41.280
 where, you know, over a long period of time,

24:41.280 --> 24:45.800
 children lost the ability to eat normal food, right?

24:45.800 --> 24:47.040
 And couldn't digest it.

24:47.040 --> 24:49.600
 And just, you know, we're literally starving

24:49.600 --> 24:53.240
 and the practitioners were trying to bring them back

24:53.240 --> 24:55.760
 to a state of thriving.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.120
 But to leave those clinics, right?

24:58.120 --> 25:00.880
 And to go to our camp or to go to our hotel.

25:00.880 --> 25:03.400
 And then to have access to food, right?

25:03.400 --> 25:05.480
 Because we could buy food on the streets

25:05.480 --> 25:08.320
 and in the hotels.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.880
 I mean, it was a very intentional act

25:10.880 --> 25:12.280
 throughout the course of the shoot

25:12.280 --> 25:14.760
 to look at a piece of bread, right?

25:14.760 --> 25:19.320
 Or to look at a bowl of rice and think about that child

25:19.320 --> 25:23.400
 in the TFC and think about how the privilege of having

25:23.400 --> 25:26.560
 that bowl of rice that I could eat and digest.

25:26.560 --> 25:32.800
 So it certainly every day helped me appreciate, right?

25:32.800 --> 25:34.280
 The privilege I had.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.480
 Every bite you take.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.640
 With every bite, absolutely.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.680
 And so I wouldn't call it guilt.

25:39.680 --> 25:40.840
 It wasn't exactly guilt,

25:40.840 --> 25:43.680
 but it was definitely mindfulness, right?

25:43.680 --> 25:48.320
 Just like meditate on the suffering of people who can't.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.720
 That's right, exactly.

25:49.720 --> 25:53.320
 So that knowledge sort of, it was catalytic in some ways.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.120
 It sort of moved us forward,

25:55.120 --> 25:59.240
 really wanting to shape the most powerful story we could

25:59.240 --> 26:03.160
 because we were surrounded by so much suffering every day.

26:03.160 --> 26:07.880
 How did that film in that movie change you as a man?

26:07.880 --> 26:09.800
 As a human being?

26:09.800 --> 26:14.240
 You filmed a few difficult documentaries.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.720
 That one is a heavy one.

26:16.720 --> 26:20.080
 When you think of the person you wore before you filmed it,

26:20.080 --> 26:21.560
 and now when you wake up every morning,

26:21.560 --> 26:23.240
 you look yourself in the mirror.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.360
 How's that person different?

26:25.360 --> 26:29.400
 Every documentary I do changes me in a different way.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.720
 I am not static in that sense, right?

26:32.720 --> 26:34.120
 And preformed.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.120
 It's like I change with every project

26:36.120 --> 26:40.480
 because so many of them are difficult and challenging, right?

26:40.480 --> 26:43.080
 And so in order to do them,

26:43.080 --> 26:46.320
 I have to allow myself to change and be changed by them.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.880
 In the case of Hunger Ward,

26:47.880 --> 26:51.880
 you may remember the girl Omeima,

26:51.880 --> 26:54.640
 who's the 10 year old girl who we showcase

26:54.640 --> 26:58.560
 in Odin, in the south of the country.

26:58.560 --> 27:03.560
 And we were there when she was admitted to the hospital.

27:04.640 --> 27:08.200
 And when she was admitted,

27:08.200 --> 27:10.760
 this 10 year old girl weighed 24 pounds

27:10.760 --> 27:13.920
 and she could barely stand up.

27:13.920 --> 27:17.880
 And we started with the permission of the family

27:17.880 --> 27:21.480
 to start to document her treatment

27:21.480 --> 27:24.880
 and to see what would happen with this young girl

27:24.880 --> 27:27.520
 who is so severely malnourished.

27:27.520 --> 27:32.520
 And we watched her be treated by the nurses and the doctors

27:33.600 --> 27:35.160
 in Sadaka Hospital.

27:35.160 --> 27:38.880
 And slowly over the course of a couple of weeks,

27:38.880 --> 27:40.800
 we saw her change.

27:40.800 --> 27:44.200
 We saw her start to sort of gain strength

27:44.200 --> 27:45.920
 and start to recover.

27:45.920 --> 27:50.920
 And she also watched the caregivers very carefully.

27:50.920 --> 27:54.320
 And I watched her watch them.

27:55.320 --> 27:59.360
 And I'll never forget there was a moment

27:59.360 --> 28:03.360
 where about two and a half weeks,

28:03.360 --> 28:06.760
 I think into her treatment, we walked into her room

28:06.760 --> 28:11.000
 and I saw her offering a cap full of water

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
 to another younger child who was also starving, right?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.280
 The shot's actually in the film.

28:18.280 --> 28:22.320
 And so to see Omeima, this child who's starving,

28:23.360 --> 28:27.160
 giving sustenance to a younger, more vulnerable child

28:27.160 --> 28:32.000
 who was also starving, moved me deeply, right?

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
 So I saw her learn from the caregivers around her, right?

28:38.480 --> 28:40.880
 And as a human being, as a filmmaker,

28:40.880 --> 28:44.240
 I was incredibly inspired by Omeima.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.520
 That capacity for compassion is there.

28:46.520 --> 28:49.600
 Even within a 10 year old girl who's starving, right?

28:49.600 --> 28:53.840
 And so you asked what changed me, that's one moment, right?

28:53.840 --> 28:57.120
 I rather than being crushed by such heavy content,

28:57.120 --> 28:58.680
 it was actually the opposite,

28:58.680 --> 29:02.360
 where I came away inspired by a 10 year old girl.

29:02.360 --> 29:05.240
 And I didn't anticipate that,

29:05.240 --> 29:07.400
 I didn't think that's what this content would do,

29:07.400 --> 29:08.600
 but it's what it did.

29:08.600 --> 29:13.080
 It reinforced for me sort of this incredible capacity

29:13.080 --> 29:16.200
 we all have as human beings, right?

29:16.200 --> 29:17.960
 To do good, right?

29:17.960 --> 29:20.920
 To even within the most difficult of circumstances,

29:20.920 --> 29:25.080
 to choose who we become and what we do.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.400
 And a 10 year old girl taught me that

29:27.400 --> 29:29.240
 or reinforced that for me.

29:29.240 --> 29:34.240
 Were you able to feel the culture of the people?

29:34.240 --> 29:37.400
 So the language barrier,

29:37.400 --> 29:39.240
 were you able to break through the language barrier

29:39.240 --> 29:42.440
 or the culture barrier to understand the people?

29:42.440 --> 29:47.440
 Because even suffering has a language of sorts

29:48.960 --> 29:50.640
 depending on where you are.

29:50.640 --> 29:54.440
 The way people joke about things, the way they cry,

29:54.440 --> 29:57.600
 the way, this is an interesting thing I actually wanna ask you.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.600
 Sorry, I'm asking a million questions.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.720
 I find that the people,

30:02.720 --> 30:06.000
 I've been talking to people in Ukraine and Russia,

30:06.000 --> 30:09.440
 but in general, I've gotten a chance to talk to people

30:09.440 --> 30:14.440
 who've been through trauma in their life and there's a humor

30:16.640 --> 30:21.640
 they have about trauma and hard times.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.960
 It depends on the culture, of course.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.360
 Certainly Russian speaking folk.

30:28.240 --> 30:31.360
 I mean, the more suffering you've experienced

30:31.360 --> 30:33.720
 for some reason, the more they joke about it.

30:33.720 --> 30:37.000
 It's almost like they're able to see something deep

30:37.000 --> 30:40.560
 about humanity now that they have suffered

30:40.560 --> 30:42.480
 and they're able to laugh at the absurdity,

30:42.480 --> 30:44.280
 the injustice of it all.

30:44.280 --> 30:47.840
 And you could also say it's a way for them to deal with it.

30:47.840 --> 30:52.840
 But that humor has a kind of profound understanding

30:55.280 --> 30:59.280
 within it about what it means to be human.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.440
 That I just, and then you,

31:01.440 --> 31:04.840
 to really understand it, you have to know the language.

31:04.840 --> 31:08.360
 I guess I'm asking, were you able to really feel

31:09.320 --> 31:11.720
 the humans in the other side of the language?

31:11.720 --> 31:12.960
 I'd like to think so.

31:12.960 --> 31:16.720
 I mean, as you noted, there are universals in life

31:16.720 --> 31:19.440
 that transcend language, right?

31:19.440 --> 31:21.880
 I mean, suffering is suffering.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.240
 Love is love.

31:23.240 --> 31:28.240
 Compassion doesn't take place only through language, right?

31:28.440 --> 31:29.400
 It's through actions.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.560
 And so, was there a language barrier?

31:31.560 --> 31:33.240
 Absolutely, right?

31:33.240 --> 31:36.880
 Did we try to bridge that through other means

31:36.880 --> 31:41.240
 and sort of universal emotions and experiences?

31:41.240 --> 31:44.040
 Absolutely, that's one of the things I always think about

31:44.040 --> 31:48.560
 when I'm filming is how do we distill down to universals,

31:48.560 --> 31:51.320
 right, through imagery, right?

31:51.320 --> 31:54.600
 Through the vocabulary of cinema, right?

31:54.600 --> 31:57.200
 Cause I believe so deeply that that vocabulary

31:57.200 --> 31:58.520
 should be visual, right?

31:58.520 --> 32:01.320
 So the words, what's the most powerful way

32:01.320 --> 32:03.240
 to express the universal?

32:03.240 --> 32:07.880
 Is it visual or is it language, words?

32:07.880 --> 32:09.840
 I think it's visual.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.640
 And we're talking about the human face

32:11.640 --> 32:14.280
 or human face, human body, everything.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.560
 Through actions as well.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.920
 Actions, the dynamic.

32:16.920 --> 32:20.040
 I'm thinking about a woman named Salha in the film.

32:20.040 --> 32:23.080
 Who isn't named, but she's,

32:23.080 --> 32:26.120
 you see her multiple times throughout the film

32:26.120 --> 32:29.400
 and she's basically the matron of the ward in the south.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.560
 And she's the gatekeeper for the ward.

32:31.560 --> 32:34.000
 So no one enters that ward without her permission.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
 She's literally the gatekeeper at the door.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
 So no one comes in unless Salha allows them to come in, right?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.120
 But then she also is sort of like

32:43.560 --> 32:47.880
 the first point of contact for compassion in the ward.

32:47.880 --> 32:51.520
 So when mothers and families are admitted,

32:51.520 --> 32:55.520
 she forms relationships between the moms

32:55.520 --> 32:57.520
 and the grandmothers, for example,

32:57.520 --> 33:00.200
 who are admitted and who are living there on the ward.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.640
 And she does it through hugging, right?

33:03.640 --> 33:07.320
 She does it through bringing them food, right?

33:07.320 --> 33:11.200
 And she forms these really rather quickly

33:11.200 --> 33:15.600
 deep relationships of compassion with the families.

33:15.600 --> 33:19.160
 And so it's amazing to watch

33:19.160 --> 33:21.240
 and no language is needed, right?

33:21.240 --> 33:23.040
 To bear witness to this.

33:23.040 --> 33:27.040
 And she also suffers because of that, right?

33:27.040 --> 33:30.360
 And so near the end of the film, if you recall,

33:31.520 --> 33:35.920
 when another child dies and the mother is wailing,

33:35.920 --> 33:39.080
 we actually cut away to Salha, who's in the hallway,

33:39.080 --> 33:43.040
 who walks into another room and begins sobbing.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.840
 She's not a family member,

33:44.840 --> 33:48.400
 but she has a deep relationship with that family

33:48.400 --> 33:51.440
 that she forged as soon as they stepped into the ward.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.400
 So that's universal, right?

33:53.400 --> 33:58.400
 To see a woman weep because a child has died,

33:58.640 --> 34:00.560
 even if they're not related to that,

34:00.560 --> 34:03.560
 that's a universal sort of emotional experience

34:03.560 --> 34:04.640
 we can all relate to.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.520
 So that's what I mean by visual vocabulary.

34:07.520 --> 34:08.880
 And it's especially powerful

34:08.880 --> 34:12.440
 because she has seen much of this kind of suffering

34:12.440 --> 34:17.040
 and she's still, maybe she has built up some callus

34:17.040 --> 34:20.040
 to be able to work day to day,

34:20.040 --> 34:25.040
 but it's still, there's still an ocean underneath the ice.

34:25.080 --> 34:28.200
 She's kept her heart open despite all the pain

34:28.200 --> 34:30.080
 that she sees and feels every day.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.000
 Somehow she's a human being who's able to do that,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.400
 which is a very difficult thing to do, right?

34:35.400 --> 34:38.800
 She still allows herself to be vulnerable.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.480
 And maybe that's why she can do what she does.

34:43.240 --> 34:45.960
 What lessons do you draw from other families in history?

34:45.960 --> 34:50.520
 So for me personally, one that's touched my family

34:50.520 --> 34:54.120
 and one of the great famines in history is in Ukraine,

34:54.120 --> 34:56.240
 Haldemur in the 30s.

34:56.240 --> 34:57.520
 32, 33, right?

34:57.520 --> 34:59.840
 32, 33 with Stalin.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.760
 Maybe you could speak to the universals

35:01.760 --> 35:03.080
 of the suffering here.

35:05.240 --> 35:09.840
 What lessons do you draw from those other famines

35:09.840 --> 35:11.880
 if you've looked at them?

35:11.880 --> 35:15.680
 Or in general about famine that are manufactured

35:15.680 --> 35:19.320
 by the decisions of, let's say, authoritarian leaders?

35:28.120 --> 35:29.800
 Famine doesn't have to exist.

35:29.800 --> 35:31.920
 Or the bulk of famines on this planet,

35:31.920 --> 35:33.240
 I believe don't have to exist.

35:33.240 --> 35:36.560
 And most of them, or at least a good number of them,

35:36.560 --> 35:39.160
 are manufactured by the leaders

35:40.240 --> 35:44.160
 that choose to use famine as a weapon, right?

35:44.160 --> 35:49.160
 And Ukraine is one of the obvious examples right now

35:49.800 --> 35:51.600
 with siege tactics that are happening

35:51.600 --> 35:53.480
 in different parts of the country.

35:53.480 --> 35:58.480
 And we built international humanitarian law

36:00.400 --> 36:02.000
 for a reason, right?

36:02.000 --> 36:03.520
 Many years ago.

36:03.520 --> 36:06.520
 And it continues to be written to this day.

36:06.520 --> 36:10.200
 And it's there to prevent what's happening

36:10.200 --> 36:11.560
 in Ukraine right now.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.240
 It's there to prevent what's been happening

36:14.240 --> 36:16.400
 in Yemen for seven years.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.880
 And yet there hasn't been any teeth behind it.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.320
 And that's what disturbs me,

36:22.320 --> 36:26.880
 is that we can see how these famines

36:26.880 --> 36:30.400
 are being used as weapons in war.

36:30.400 --> 36:33.520
 And yet we aren't sort of using the levers

36:33.520 --> 36:37.960
 of power that exist in order to,

36:37.960 --> 36:42.520
 I think, to call out in important and powerful ways

36:42.520 --> 36:44.040
 those who are causing them

36:44.040 --> 36:46.800
 and to make sure that we hold them accountable

36:46.800 --> 36:47.680
 on the global stage.

36:47.680 --> 36:51.800
 Now, to some extent that seems to be happening in Ukraine

36:51.800 --> 36:54.360
 in a way that hasn't happened for a long time.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.960
 And that gives me hope, right?

36:56.960 --> 36:59.440
 And yet I don't believe we've done enough.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.120
 And I think the international community needs to do far more

37:03.120 --> 37:06.480
 than we are both in Yemen, in Ethiopia,

37:06.480 --> 37:08.040
 and in Ukraine right now.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.680
 There are certain kinds of things

37:10.680 --> 37:14.160
 that captivate the global attention.

37:14.160 --> 37:17.040
 And it seems like starvation is not always one of them.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.760
 For some reason, murder and destruction

37:22.800 --> 37:25.280
 gets people attention more.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.480
 The death, of course, is easy to enumerate,

37:28.480 --> 37:30.640
 but it's the suffering that's the problem.

37:30.640 --> 37:31.760
 Yeah, yeah.

37:31.760 --> 37:34.400
 You know, when we went to film Hungerward,

37:34.400 --> 37:36.680
 that was one of the creative questions

37:36.680 --> 37:38.320
 that I was really concerned about

37:38.320 --> 37:43.240
 because starvation, you know, it's not a quick action, right?

37:43.240 --> 37:47.360
 It's a long, slow, insidious process, right?

37:47.360 --> 37:49.520
 Just like hunger, right?

37:49.520 --> 37:52.400
 And yet when you're hungry, right?

37:53.360 --> 37:55.360
 It takes you over.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.000
 It becomes the most important thing, right?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.600
 It's just absolutely fundamental to life.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.520
 It's like drawing breath.

38:02.520 --> 38:06.440
 And so I really, before I filmed Hungerward,

38:06.440 --> 38:09.120
 I struggled to sort of answer

38:09.120 --> 38:11.160
 how we could creatively approach that

38:11.160 --> 38:14.760
 because someone's sitting in a clinic, right?

38:14.760 --> 38:18.040
 Starving or being treated for starvation, you know?

38:18.040 --> 38:20.520
 That's a pretty static scene, right?

38:21.680 --> 38:25.640
 And what we found was that because of the volume of cases

38:25.640 --> 38:29.440
 and because of the nature of sort of how quickly

38:29.440 --> 38:32.200
 people were coming and going,

38:32.200 --> 38:34.640
 is that it was more dynamic than we anticipated.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.960
 And there's something also about starvation.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.400
 You get tired.

38:40.400 --> 38:43.600
 It's almost like it's a quiet suffering.

38:43.600 --> 38:44.640
 Yeah.

38:44.640 --> 38:48.240
 Like, and by the way, there's something about,

38:48.240 --> 38:50.120
 when I think about dog times,

38:50.120 --> 38:53.280
 I mean, you'll hear me chuckle, for example.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.600
 I don't know what that is.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.480
 That's almost like,

38:56.480 --> 39:01.480
 it's almost like you have to kind of laugh at,

39:03.720 --> 39:07.720
 you can't help but laugh at like the injustice

39:07.720 --> 39:08.800
 and the cruelty in the world,

39:08.800 --> 39:10.800
 somehow that helps your mind deal with it.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.240
 I mean, I see this all the time.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.120
 Like, when you're struggling,

39:15.120 --> 39:16.440
 you can't feed your family.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.720
 You lost your home.

39:18.680 --> 39:21.600
 The last thing you have is jokes about.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.440
 It's humor.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.280
 Yeah, it's humor.

39:23.280 --> 39:28.200
 It's like, ah, the fucking man, fuck me over again.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.440
 And there's jokes all around that.

39:30.440 --> 39:34.360
 And then you laugh and you drink vodka

39:34.360 --> 39:36.040
 and you play music.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.280
 I don't know what that is.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.280
 I don't know what that is.

39:38.280 --> 39:39.560
 It's Gallo's humor, right?

39:39.560 --> 39:44.320
 It's a way of, I think, simultaneously acknowledging

39:44.320 --> 39:46.800
 and allowing yourself to move forward, right?

39:46.800 --> 39:49.800
 Beyond the pain and the suffering.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.880
 So you mentioned Ukraine and you mentioned Putin.

39:52.880 --> 39:57.880
 What are your thoughts about the humanitarian crisis

39:58.280 --> 40:00.640
 and generally the suffering that's resulting

40:00.640 --> 40:02.360
 from the war in Ukraine?

40:02.360 --> 40:03.920
 Well, first off, I think the conflict

40:03.920 --> 40:06.200
 is just gonna exacerbate, you know,

40:06.200 --> 40:11.200
 sort of the global challenge we have with displacement.

40:12.480 --> 40:17.480
 The last entire trilogy I did was about displacement

40:17.480 --> 40:19.480
 to a great extent, did a war.

40:19.480 --> 40:23.000
 And, you know, this is a huge displacement of human beings

40:23.000 --> 40:24.680
 regardless of the cause.

40:24.680 --> 40:29.160
 And that is gonna sort of have a ripple effect

40:29.160 --> 40:31.920
 across the globe for many, many years to come,

40:31.920 --> 40:34.880
 regardless of even if the conflict ended today.

40:34.880 --> 40:35.720
 So there's that.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.960
 That's gonna set up a whole other strain

40:37.960 --> 40:42.960
 on sort of the global sort of resources

40:43.960 --> 40:47.680
 that come into play to deal with refugees.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.760
 You know, there were 79 million displaced people

40:50.760 --> 40:54.720
 on this globe prior to the Ukrainian conflict, right?

40:54.720 --> 40:56.520
 You probably know the numbers better than I do

40:56.520 --> 40:59.280
 in terms of what the current estimates are

40:59.280 --> 41:00.840
 for displacement from Ukraine.

41:00.840 --> 41:01.880
 Four to six million.

41:01.880 --> 41:03.160
 So what are we up to now?

41:03.160 --> 41:07.040
 73, 74 million individuals on this planet now

41:07.040 --> 41:09.200
 who are displaced.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.800
 That's a significant bump.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.160
 I wish that the levers of power were used differently

41:16.160 --> 41:19.600
 in situations like Ukraine and Syria, for example.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.320
 So what are the levers of power?

41:23.320 --> 41:24.480
 Well, military might.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.720
 Let's take that for one, right?

41:26.720 --> 41:31.720
 So I have always felt after working in Syria and Turkey

41:34.640 --> 41:39.640
 that we completely missed our opportunity as a player

41:40.880 --> 41:44.360
 on the global stage with military capability

41:44.360 --> 41:48.720
 to prevent the killing of hundreds of thousands

41:48.720 --> 41:50.880
 of civilians in Syria.

41:50.880 --> 41:54.680
 We had the ability and we didn't leverage that ability.

41:54.680 --> 41:59.680
 You know, the fact that I talked with so many Syrians

41:59.760 --> 42:02.040
 during the course of doing that project

42:02.040 --> 42:07.040
 who told me their stories of living in their house, right?

42:07.560 --> 42:12.480
 And having a Syrian helicopter fly over their house

42:12.480 --> 42:17.080
 and drop a 55 gallon drum full of explosives and shrapnel

42:19.320 --> 42:24.080
 in their neighborhood over and over and over again.

42:24.080 --> 42:27.640
 Not focused on any military targets,

42:27.640 --> 42:31.560
 only meant to kill and so fear, right?

42:31.560 --> 42:35.560
 And early in the conflict, we could have stopped that, right?

42:35.560 --> 42:37.760
 Before Russia got involved,

42:37.760 --> 42:40.840
 we could have intervened and created a no fly zone.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.920
 We, the United States, we, the United States

42:42.920 --> 42:45.360
 or a coalition that we were a part of, yeah.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.400
 And we didn't do it and we could have,

42:47.400 --> 42:49.520
 and I think that's an example where we have

42:49.520 --> 42:52.200
 the military capable ability to actually do good

42:52.200 --> 42:53.440
 in a situation like that.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.720
 And we don't usually use it for those purposes.

42:55.720 --> 42:58.720
 And I think that's what a military ought to be used for

42:58.720 --> 43:00.120
 beyond just defending our borders

43:00.120 --> 43:04.880
 is to save others with the privilege that that power affords.

43:04.880 --> 43:07.480
 What do you think about the power of the military

43:07.480 --> 43:09.200
 versus the power of sanctions

43:09.200 --> 43:11.280
 versus the power of conversation?

43:12.560 --> 43:14.000
 They're all different tools, right?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.520
 To be used at different moments.

43:15.520 --> 43:20.520
 But if words fail, if sanctions fail, right?

43:21.400 --> 43:24.120
 I think there are moments in history

43:24.120 --> 43:26.360
 where power is justified, right?

43:26.360 --> 43:28.200
 And I think Syria was one of them.

43:28.200 --> 43:31.920
 I think when barrel bombs were dropping

43:31.920 --> 43:34.760
 on civilian neighborhoods for months and months and months

43:34.760 --> 43:38.360
 with no intent to do anything other than to kill

43:38.360 --> 43:41.480
 Syrian civilians, that's an instant.

43:41.480 --> 43:43.560
 I think where might is justified

43:43.560 --> 43:45.320
 to shoot those helicopters out of the sky.

43:45.320 --> 43:48.480
 Here's the difficult thing, we talked about Yemen.

43:48.480 --> 43:53.120
 Where's the line between good and evil

43:53.120 --> 43:56.840
 for US intervention in different countries

43:56.840 --> 43:58.560
 and conflicts in the world?

43:59.680 --> 44:03.280
 It's easy to look back 10, 20, 30 years to know what was

44:03.280 --> 44:05.720
 and wasn't a quote unquote just war.

44:05.720 --> 44:09.720
 In the moment, how do we know?

44:09.720 --> 44:12.320
 I think it's incredibly difficult to answer that, right?

44:12.320 --> 44:15.800
 And I think that's why leaders make the wrong choices

44:15.800 --> 44:16.640
 so often, right?

44:16.640 --> 44:18.360
 As they second guess themselves.

44:19.760 --> 44:22.400
 I think you take all the data at your fingertips,

44:22.400 --> 44:24.360
 all the intelligence that you have, right?

44:24.360 --> 44:26.720
 And you look at it all very carefully

44:26.720 --> 44:28.760
 and you make a decision, right?

44:28.760 --> 44:31.120
 There are some instances though

44:31.120 --> 44:34.720
 where it's very clear what's happening, right?

44:34.720 --> 44:37.080
 And leaders still don't act, right?

44:37.080 --> 44:39.320
 In Yemen right now, for example,

44:39.320 --> 44:41.560
 it's very clear what's happening, right?

44:41.560 --> 44:44.200
 Children are being starved because of a blockade.

44:45.080 --> 44:48.920
 All the US would have to do is ensure that blockade,

44:48.920 --> 44:50.920
 now there's a two month ceasefire in place now,

44:50.920 --> 44:54.600
 but remains lifted beyond the ceasefire

44:54.600 --> 44:56.920
 and children will stop starving.

44:56.920 --> 44:58.440
 That's pretty simple.

44:58.440 --> 45:01.320
 You can trace, it's a direct connection.

45:01.320 --> 45:05.000
 And we haven't had the sort of the more aware with all

45:05.000 --> 45:08.080
 to make that decision because we're too interested

45:08.080 --> 45:10.960
 in maintaining positive ties with Saudi Arabia

45:10.960 --> 45:14.440
 where oil flows from and so much influence

45:16.040 --> 45:17.720
 because Saudi Arabia has so much influence

45:17.720 --> 45:19.960
 throughout the MENA region.

45:19.960 --> 45:22.200
 We want to keep that relationship tight

45:22.200 --> 45:26.400
 despite sort of the more wounds that come from that.

45:26.400 --> 45:30.640
 About half the world is under authoritarian regimes.

45:30.640 --> 45:33.440
 Everybody operates under narratives

45:33.440 --> 45:35.800
 and there's a narrative in the United States

45:35.800 --> 45:38.920
 that freedom is good, democracy is good.

45:40.200 --> 45:43.560
 I have fallen victim to this narrative.

45:43.560 --> 45:44.680
 I believe in it.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.560
 I'm saying this jokingly, but not really

45:49.640 --> 45:53.080
 because who knows the truth of anything in this world?

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
 I eat meat, factory farm meat,

45:57.000 --> 46:00.560
 and I seem to not be intellectually and philosophically

46:00.560 --> 46:02.600
 tortured by this and I should be.

46:02.600 --> 46:05.000
 There's a lot of suffering there.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.320
 What do we do to lessen the suffering

46:09.320 --> 46:11.600
 of the people under authoritarian regimes?

46:12.640 --> 46:14.720
 Again, the same question.

46:14.720 --> 46:19.720
 Military conflict, diplomacy, sanctions,

46:20.320 --> 46:21.720
 all those kinds of things.

46:21.720 --> 46:26.720
 Does that lessen suffering or increase the suffering

46:28.600 --> 46:30.280
 from what you see in Yemen?

46:31.800 --> 46:36.280
 Is it something that has to be healed across generations

46:36.280 --> 46:39.280
 or can be healed on a scale of months and years?

46:39.280 --> 46:42.160
 I'm just a guy with camera, Alex, you know?

46:42.160 --> 46:43.520
 But as a guy with a camera,

46:43.520 --> 46:48.520
 I've seen a lot of things in a lot of places

46:48.520 --> 46:53.520
 and I've seen the effects these decisions

46:54.040 --> 46:59.040
 made by authoritarian leaders have on their own citizens.

46:59.320 --> 47:02.560
 And that's what drives my thinking on this.

47:04.520 --> 47:08.400
 And that's what drives and motivates me each day

47:08.400 --> 47:11.240
 to raise the red flag through my films

47:11.240 --> 47:16.240
 and say, listen, Biden, you campaigned for president,

47:20.320 --> 47:23.520
 in part on a platform that said

47:23.520 --> 47:26.960
 that we would regain our prominence

47:26.960 --> 47:29.320
 on the moral stage of the world, right?

47:29.320 --> 47:34.320
 And that we would prioritize sort of a moral paradigm

47:36.440 --> 47:40.200
 over relationships with authoritarian regimes,

47:40.200 --> 47:42.240
 Saudi Arabia being one, right?

47:42.240 --> 47:45.720
 And yet when the CIA report came out

47:45.720 --> 47:48.760
 that clearly articulated in detail

47:48.760 --> 47:52.080
 that MBS was responsible for Khashoggi's murder

47:52.080 --> 47:54.240
 and for cutting his body into pieces

47:54.240 --> 47:57.280
 and probably burning it in the backyard of the embassy,

47:58.200 --> 47:59.280
 what did Biden do?

48:00.280 --> 48:03.160
 He didn't really make a pariah out of MBS

48:03.160 --> 48:05.920
 like he said he was going to, right?

48:05.920 --> 48:07.640
 What if he'd done something else

48:07.640 --> 48:09.920
 and actually done what he said he was gonna do,

48:09.920 --> 48:10.760
 which was make MBS?

48:10.760 --> 48:14.360
 What if he would remove the ability for MBS

48:14.360 --> 48:17.120
 to fly to the United States, for example?

48:17.120 --> 48:18.760
 Now that's a sanction, right?

48:18.760 --> 48:22.400
 That's a sanction that's individual and concrete

48:22.400 --> 48:25.840
 and would be hugely embarrassing for MBS.

48:25.840 --> 48:28.040
 That would have been Biden saying,

48:28.040 --> 48:31.920
 this is unacceptable behavior, right?

48:31.920 --> 48:36.280
 This is something which because you executed

48:36.280 --> 48:40.840
 such a horrendous act on someone living in the United States,

48:40.840 --> 48:41.680
 right?

48:41.680 --> 48:46.680
 We are not going to give you a stage here at least, right?

48:47.520 --> 48:49.680
 Within the borders of our country.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.880
 Those are the things that leaders can do

48:51.880 --> 48:53.800
 that I don't think they do often enough.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.600
 And certainly our leader right now

48:55.600 --> 48:57.760
 isn't doing it in the way I wish you were.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.400
 He certainly has taken a different stand on Ukraine

49:02.200 --> 49:03.600
 and been very vocal,

49:03.600 --> 49:05.920
 but there's so many instances we could talk about

49:05.920 --> 49:10.560
 where I feel like the political game and ship, right?

49:10.560 --> 49:13.960
 Often falls into maintaining relationships

49:13.960 --> 49:15.720
 like with MBS and Saudi Arabia,

49:15.720 --> 49:17.360
 rather than doing the right thing,

49:17.360 --> 49:21.480
 rather than as a nation, a leader of a nation saying,

49:21.480 --> 49:24.840
 this is unacceptable, we have a higher standard than this.

49:24.840 --> 49:27.800
 Cause I think when leaders do that,

49:29.160 --> 49:31.080
 it becomes aspirational, right?

49:31.080 --> 49:33.480
 It becomes aspirational for other leaders

49:33.480 --> 49:36.680
 in the progressive world at least.

49:36.680 --> 49:39.120
 And also it rings the alarm bells

49:39.120 --> 49:42.200
 for other authoritarian leaders and says,

49:42.200 --> 49:44.680
 you know what, there are lines, right?

49:44.680 --> 49:46.720
 There are things that can't be done

49:46.720 --> 49:48.640
 or there will be significant consequences,

49:48.640 --> 49:51.760
 like you will not be able to fly into our airspace anymore.

49:51.760 --> 49:55.680
 And sanctions I think need to be concrete and individual

49:55.680 --> 49:58.560
 to some, in addition to the larger scope,

49:58.560 --> 50:00.920
 but when they're concrete and individual,

50:00.920 --> 50:04.880
 I think often they're felt in a different way.

50:04.880 --> 50:07.280
 You mean felt obviously by the individuals

50:07.280 --> 50:09.840
 and so the ripple effects of that

50:12.120 --> 50:17.120
 might have the power to steer the direction of nations.

50:18.800 --> 50:21.960
 Because of the nature of authoritarian regimes, right?

50:21.960 --> 50:23.200
 Individuals have so much power.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.280
 Exactly, right.

50:24.280 --> 50:28.880
 So, you know, if Putin is, you know,

50:28.880 --> 50:30.760
 put on trial in the Hague at some point

50:30.760 --> 50:32.600
 or at least there's the threat of that, right?

50:32.600 --> 50:34.840
 Now that's likely never to happen, of course,

50:34.840 --> 50:37.680
 because someone has to be in custody to go on trial, right?

50:37.680 --> 50:39.800
 And he's never gonna allow that to happen.

50:39.800 --> 50:44.800
 But just knowing that that danger exists

50:46.280 --> 50:50.240
 is going to change his travel plans in the future, right?

50:50.240 --> 50:52.480
 MBS not being able to fly to the US,

50:52.480 --> 50:55.360
 he's gonna feel that and be embarrassed by that.

50:55.360 --> 51:00.360
 So I think they have a special meaning

51:00.360 --> 51:03.080
 and consequence in authoritarian regimes because of that.

51:04.080 --> 51:06.120
 So you said you're just a guy with a camera?

51:06.120 --> 51:06.960
 Yeah.

51:07.800 --> 51:12.800
 I would say you're a brilliant guy with a camera.

51:13.960 --> 51:16.000
 I'm also a kind of guy with a camera.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
 You're a guy with a couple cameras.

51:17.000 --> 51:17.840
 A couple cameras.

51:17.840 --> 51:18.680
 I've worked multiple times.

51:18.680 --> 51:20.480
 A couple mics too.

51:20.480 --> 51:23.200
 You got a couple mics, a couple cameras, robot over here.

51:23.200 --> 51:25.640
 When you can't beat them with quality,

51:25.640 --> 51:27.320
 you bring the quantity.

51:27.320 --> 51:28.520
 That's right.

51:28.520 --> 51:31.800
 So to me, that's also an interest partially

51:31.800 --> 51:36.160
 because I also speak Russian and a bit Ukrainian.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.920
 I wanna study that part of the world.

51:39.920 --> 51:41.680
 I wanna talk to a lot of people.

51:41.680 --> 51:42.920
 I wanna talk to the leaders.

51:42.920 --> 51:44.600
 I wanna talk to regular people.

51:44.600 --> 51:48.760
 To be honest, and I would love to get your comments on this.

51:48.760 --> 51:51.400
 The regular quote unquote people

51:51.400 --> 51:53.440
 are way more fascinating to me.

51:53.440 --> 51:56.520
 As a filmmaker, how do you figure out

51:56.520 --> 51:58.360
 how to tell this story?

51:58.360 --> 52:00.280
 I'm sure a guy with a camera,

52:00.280 --> 52:02.400
 you're looking at war in Ukraine,

52:02.400 --> 52:05.920
 but also what's going on in Yemen and Syria

52:05.920 --> 52:07.120
 and other places in the world.

52:07.120 --> 52:08.400
 I mentioned North Korea.

52:08.400 --> 52:10.280
 That's a super interesting one.

52:10.280 --> 52:11.760
 Hard to bring cameras along.

52:11.760 --> 52:16.560
 China, like in Canada, the truckers,

52:16.560 --> 52:18.840
 there's all kinds of fascinating things happening

52:18.840 --> 52:19.760
 in the world.

52:19.760 --> 52:23.760
 So you as a scholar of human suffering

52:23.760 --> 52:25.040
 and human flourishing,

52:26.320 --> 52:28.320
 how do you choose how to tell the story?

52:29.200 --> 52:30.120
 How do I choose a story?

52:30.120 --> 52:31.240
 How do I choose how to tell a story?

52:31.240 --> 52:34.440
 Both the story and how, I assume those are coupled.

52:35.880 --> 52:38.080
 So how do you choose which story to tell?

52:38.080 --> 52:40.920
 And how do you choose how to tell that story?

52:40.920 --> 52:42.000
 Yeah.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.640
 Well, in terms of how to choose which story,

52:45.640 --> 52:50.640
 you know, it's a bit of a mystery potion for me, frankly.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.520
 I go off and on instinct,

52:55.520 --> 52:58.840
 but there's also a highly intentional piece of it

52:58.840 --> 53:00.120
 for me as well.

53:00.120 --> 53:02.320
 And the intentional piece is,

53:03.360 --> 53:06.440
 I guess I'd call it the do I care threshold,

53:06.440 --> 53:08.480
 you know, or the so what threshold.

53:08.480 --> 53:11.280
 You personally, just something in your heart

53:11.280 --> 53:14.440
 just kind of gets excited or hurts

53:14.440 --> 53:15.720
 or just feels something.

53:15.720 --> 53:17.640
 So one of the things that disturbs the amount

53:17.640 --> 53:20.320
 of American culture, Lex, is that, you know,

53:20.320 --> 53:22.200
 we seem to be a people that's fascinated

53:22.200 --> 53:24.160
 by reality television, for example,

53:24.160 --> 53:27.680
 like look at how many of us here in America

53:28.680 --> 53:31.200
 watch reality television, right?

53:31.200 --> 53:32.520
 That deeply disturbs me.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.240
 Not that I've never watched an episode,

53:34.240 --> 53:36.920
 I've shot a whole season of it once to make a living, right?

53:36.920 --> 53:39.440
 So it's like, I know it, right?

53:39.440 --> 53:43.520
 But I feel like the things we should be paying attention to

53:43.520 --> 53:45.720
 are the things, personally,

53:45.720 --> 53:48.800
 are the things I choose to film, right?

53:48.800 --> 53:53.800
 As a human being, as a dad, as a filmmaker,

53:54.440 --> 53:56.800
 I think we should be paying attention

53:56.800 --> 53:59.520
 to the fact that children are being starved in Yemen.

53:59.520 --> 54:01.680
 I think we should be paying attention to the fact

54:01.680 --> 54:05.240
 that Ukrainians are being displaced by the millions.

54:05.240 --> 54:07.680
 So there's this so what threshold that I use.

54:07.680 --> 54:10.200
 And I feel like it has to be a topic

54:10.200 --> 54:12.400
 that if we don't cover

54:12.400 --> 54:14.760
 and we don't put out in the world

54:14.760 --> 54:16.800
 in the largest possible way,

54:16.800 --> 54:18.200
 in the hope of intervening,

54:18.200 --> 54:20.960
 in the hope of marshaling maximum resources

54:20.960 --> 54:23.400
 and attention to solving the problem,

54:23.400 --> 54:26.480
 that's what I'm dedicated to as a filmmaker.

54:26.480 --> 54:29.880
 Because I didn't pick up a camera initially

54:29.880 --> 54:32.520
 to film puppy dogs, right?

54:32.520 --> 54:34.140
 To make people smile.

54:34.140 --> 54:37.120
 I believe the camera is a tool for change.

54:37.120 --> 54:40.800
 I believe the camera is a powerful tool

54:40.800 --> 54:44.840
 that we can use to raise awareness and marshal resources

54:44.840 --> 54:48.280
 and help people understand the impact

54:48.280 --> 54:50.760
 that these geopolitical decisions have

54:50.760 --> 54:52.360
 on real people's lives.

54:52.360 --> 54:57.360
 And that's the intent I create each film with.

54:58.100 --> 54:59.980
 Now, how I choose each story,

54:59.980 --> 55:02.480
 that's the magic potion piece of it, right?

55:02.480 --> 55:05.440
 And often one flows rather organically

55:05.440 --> 55:07.280
 into another, frankly.

55:07.280 --> 55:08.760
 So you just kind of, like you said,

55:08.760 --> 55:10.560
 you go with instinct a little bit.

55:10.560 --> 55:12.360
 To some extent, but oftentimes,

55:12.360 --> 55:15.080
 I choose the next project based on relationships

55:15.080 --> 55:18.840
 I've developed in the last film, right?

55:18.840 --> 55:21.200
 And so one often flows into another

55:21.200 --> 55:22.480
 through relationships I develop

55:22.480 --> 55:25.120
 and then a colleague will share a detail

55:25.120 --> 55:27.880
 about something that's happening in a certain place

55:27.880 --> 55:31.360
 and I'll go, hmm, really, I didn't know that, right?

55:31.360 --> 55:34.400
 And usually it's before it's hit the world stage

55:34.400 --> 55:35.360
 in a big way.

55:35.360 --> 55:37.280
 And so I start to do due diligence

55:37.280 --> 55:39.840
 and often that it reveals it to be a much bigger

55:39.840 --> 55:44.160
 and more pressing topic that I want to learn more about.

55:45.640 --> 55:50.640
 Before I talk to you about Syria and lifeboat,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.040
 you mentioned a camera is the best weapon.

55:55.920 --> 55:56.920
 Maybe just...

55:56.920 --> 55:59.200
 Well, I can't take out a tank, right?

55:59.200 --> 56:00.040
 But it's a good weapon.

56:00.040 --> 56:01.680
 Second, top three.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.360
 I love the humor throughout this.

56:04.360 --> 56:06.560
 I really appreciate it.

56:06.560 --> 56:11.560
 We were talking about such dark topics and it resets the mind

56:12.520 --> 56:14.440
 in a way that allows me to think.

56:14.440 --> 56:15.360
 So thank you.

56:17.240 --> 56:22.240
 As a filmmaker, almost want to talk about

56:23.960 --> 56:25.880
 the technical details.

56:25.880 --> 56:26.720
 Uh oh.

56:26.720 --> 56:31.240
 How do you choose to shoot stuff?

56:31.240 --> 56:33.720
 Again, so maybe you can explain to me,

56:33.720 --> 56:38.720
 I work with incredible folks that care about lenses

56:39.960 --> 56:42.840
 and equipment and so on.

56:42.840 --> 56:47.840
 I tend to be somebody that just wants to kind of go

56:50.320 --> 56:52.960
 as like a gorilla shooting.

56:52.960 --> 56:57.960
 Like not plan too much, just go with gritty.

56:58.560 --> 57:01.040
 I'm trying to come up with words that sound positive.

57:01.040 --> 57:04.000
 Do a positive spin on what I try to do,

57:04.000 --> 57:08.480
 but like gritty, don't over plan, use...

57:08.480 --> 57:10.760
 Like we had a big discussion if you see this light.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.160
 Yeah.

57:12.160 --> 57:15.680
 It's on a stand that's a very ghetto stand.

57:15.680 --> 57:16.520
 Yeah.

57:16.520 --> 57:17.360
 It's cheap.

57:17.360 --> 57:18.200
 You need a sandbag on that, man.

57:18.200 --> 57:19.040
 Exactly.

57:19.040 --> 57:23.800
 So no sandbag and like the stand is actually bending

57:23.800 --> 57:25.200
 under the weight of that thing.

57:25.200 --> 57:26.360
 It could fall on us.

57:26.360 --> 57:27.200
 It could fall.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.200
 It probably won't reach us, but it could fall.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.920
 But the danger live under that danger

57:30.920 --> 57:32.640
 and embrace that danger.

57:32.640 --> 57:33.480
 Love it.

57:34.360 --> 57:36.480
 Because that thing is easier to transport

57:36.480 --> 57:38.120
 than a heavier one.

57:38.120 --> 57:40.280
 Sandbag, that's extra weight.

57:40.280 --> 57:42.840
 So if you keep, like people tell me,

57:42.840 --> 57:44.640
 there's the right way to do stuff.

57:44.640 --> 57:46.680
 Like here's these giant cases

57:46.680 --> 57:49.240
 with all the kinds of padding for transporting stuff.

57:49.240 --> 57:52.440
 I transport most of the equipment in a garbage bag.

57:52.440 --> 57:54.600
 So that's just a preference

57:54.600 --> 57:57.800
 because that's somehow that chaos allows me

57:57.800 --> 58:02.800
 to ignore all the stupidity of loving the equipment

58:03.080 --> 58:04.800
 and focusing on the story.

58:04.800 --> 58:09.800
 So that said, I've never shot anything like worthwhile.

58:11.120 --> 58:15.680
 Like there is power to the visual.

58:15.680 --> 58:16.520
 Yeah.

58:16.520 --> 58:17.840
 Like definitely.

58:17.840 --> 58:22.840
 And so finding a certain angle, a certain light,

58:23.000 --> 58:24.400
 whether it's natural light

58:24.400 --> 58:26.440
 or additional artificial lighting,

58:26.440 --> 58:29.040
 just capturing a tear.

58:29.040 --> 58:34.040
 Capturing when the person forgets themselves for a moment

58:34.280 --> 58:37.040
 and looks out into the distance, missing somebody,

58:37.040 --> 58:38.800
 thinking about somebody.

58:38.800 --> 58:41.360
 All of those like moments you can capture,

58:41.360 --> 58:45.240
 a lens, a camera can do magic with that.

58:45.240 --> 58:46.760
 I don't even know the question I'm asking you,

58:46.760 --> 58:51.480
 but how do both technical and philosophical,

58:51.480 --> 58:54.560
 how do you capture the visual power that you're after?

58:54.560 --> 58:55.720
 Yeah.

58:55.720 --> 58:59.320
 So many of my films, I think,

58:59.320 --> 59:03.320
 are built on the premise of access, right?

59:03.320 --> 59:05.080
 Built on this notion that

59:07.640 --> 59:12.640
 the biggest hurdle to the story is getting there,

59:13.080 --> 59:15.200
 being there in the room

59:15.200 --> 59:20.200
 or being there on the boat while the crisis is unfolding.

59:20.200 --> 59:23.520
 And that access typically is really nuanced

59:23.520 --> 59:26.360
 and difficult to gain.

59:26.360 --> 59:29.280
 And then trust flows from that, right?

59:29.280 --> 59:32.200
 Cause usually it takes a long time to gain that access.

59:33.080 --> 59:35.760
 Because that access is so hard fought,

59:37.320 --> 59:42.320
 it necessarily informs how we film, right?

59:43.680 --> 59:47.680
 To be in a room at Sadaka Hospital in Southern Yemen.

59:47.680 --> 59:51.120
 I can't have five people in that room, right?

59:51.120 --> 59:54.560
 I can't have a boom mic over a scene.

59:55.920 --> 59:59.600
 I want creatively the opposite of that as well.

59:59.600 --> 1:00:01.360
 So it's not just a logistical question,

1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:03.520
 it's also a creative question

1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:05.640
 to capture intimate moments

1:00:05.640 --> 1:00:09.760
 where families are dealing with suffering children

1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:12.120
 and dying children and caretaking

1:00:12.120 --> 1:00:14.680
 is active and ongoing all the time.

1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:16.680
 You don't wanna interrupt that moment.

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:18.760
 And so that informs how I do things.

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:22.680
 So we go fleet and nimble and small.

1:00:22.680 --> 1:00:24.800
 Those are all really good words for...

1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:27.800
 But it's so it's logistical on the one hand

1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:29.840
 but it's also a creative choice, right?

1:00:29.840 --> 1:00:31.920
 So when we filmed Hunger Ward,

1:00:31.920 --> 1:00:34.560
 it's two people were filming the entire film, right?

1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:36.600
 Me and my director of photography.

1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:38.000
 That was the two people in the room?

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.080
 Two people in the room.

1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:41.000
 Yeah, that's it, the whole film, right?

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.160
 We had a field producer as well in each part of the country

1:00:43.160 --> 1:00:45.360
 but in terms of camera, it's just two people.

1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:46.720
 And we're doing everything

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:51.440
 and we have lenses that are long enough

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:53.640
 that we don't have to move to capture the film.

1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:56.640
 So we can tuck into a corner sometimes, right?

1:00:56.640 --> 1:00:58.320
 So just what's long mean?

1:00:58.320 --> 1:00:59.920
 That means they're standing farther away

1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:02.240
 and they can... Zoom lens, it's not a prime lens.

1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:04.040
 So it's not a fixed focal length, right?

1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:04.920
 Because a fixed focal length,

1:01:04.920 --> 1:01:07.720
 you have to move a lot more in order to capture action.

1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:12.920
 With a zoom lens, maybe a 105 at the long end,

1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:14.680
 I can tuck into a corner

1:01:14.680 --> 1:01:16.840
 and just film from 15 feet away

1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:19.000
 instead of having to get right up on someone, right?

1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.960
 So you'd less like to interrupt the scene

1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:25.920
 and you can kind of become the fly on the wall sometimes.

1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:30.200
 So I'm very intentional about that piece of it

1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:33.560
 so that we can capture those vulnerable moments

1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:34.560
 and not interrupt them.

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:39.760
 That's really fascinating too, because the access...

1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:42.880
 I don't often think about this

1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:44.880
 but that's probably true for me as well.

1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:51.160
 Part of the storytelling is to be in the room.

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:53.680
 And that's the hard part.

1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:56.360
 For me, most of my films, that's the hardest part.

1:01:56.360 --> 1:01:59.840
 Actually, as hard as Hunger Ward and Lifeboat were to film

1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:01.320
 and 15 feet from Syria,

1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:04.720
 the getting their piece of it for the last two

1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:06.200
 was much harder.

1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:09.360
 Yeah, and it's also... It's a creative act.

1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:12.520
 It's... I don't know if it is for you,

1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:15.080
 but it's the kind of people you talk to.

1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:18.600
 It's like how you live your life.

1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:21.040
 Like the kind of people I talk to right now,

1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:22.720
 they steer the direction of my life

1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:25.560
 and steer the direction of things that I'll film.

1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:28.280
 So it's not just like you're trying to get access.

1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:30.800
 It's like, it's everything.

1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:34.280
 It builds and builds and builds.

1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:35.120
 It builds on itself.

1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:36.400
 Yeah, yeah.

1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:38.800
 I mean, part of the thing, even saying,

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:40.120
 talking about some of these leaders

1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:41.840
 and conversations with them,

1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:44.960
 it's almost like steering your life

1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:47.760
 into the direction of the difficult,

1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:50.000
 of like taking the leap

1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:54.720
 and if you're a good human being

1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:00.400
 and a lot of people know who you are as a human,

1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:04.120
 like not as a name, but as really who you are,

1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:06.920
 that like putting that attention out there,

1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:10.960
 it's somehow the world opens doors

1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:15.960
 where the access that was once seemed impossible

1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:19.640
 becomes possible and then all of that

1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:22.200
 is a creative journey to be in the room.

1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:23.640
 I think that probably is,

1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:26.640
 I mean, it's true even for fiction films, probably,

1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:30.240
 is like everything that led to that,

1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:33.400
 like to be in the room, the journey to be in the room

1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:37.720
 and to shoot the scene is maybe more important

1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:40.640
 than the scene itself and like really

1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:42.880
 focus on the creative act of that.

1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:43.960
 Yeah, that's really fascinating

1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:46.000
 and especially, I mean, with a documentary,

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.760
 you get one take.

1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:50.040
 Yeah, you can't say, hey, reset, right?

1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:51.200
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:53.160
 God, that is so interesting.

1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:56.200
 As you were in some of the most difficult parts

1:03:56.200 --> 1:03:58.680
 of the world in the room

1:03:58.680 --> 1:04:02.080
 with some of the most difficult stories to be told.

1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:05.560
 And yet, I think that's why I keep doing these stories,

1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:09.280
 right, because once you have that lived experience,

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:14.280
 for me, it's moving.

1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:21.880
 It moves me to bear witness to these inspiring people

1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:26.800
 under difficult circumstances.

1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:31.800
 And I can't come back to the US afterwards

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.880
 and walk down the grocery aisle

1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:40.440
 where there's 50 different choices for canned peas, right?

1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:45.320
 And not sort of feel that lived tension, right?

1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:47.520
 That lived tension of the privilege

1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:49.480
 that I have here in the US.

1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:52.320
 And then I have a choice about what to do

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:54.240
 with that privilege, right?

1:04:54.240 --> 1:04:58.600
 And the last thing I wanna do is start, you know,

1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:01.360
 doing stories about dandelions, right?

1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:02.960
 There's far more important things to do

1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:05.920
 on this very limited time that I have on the planet.

1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:10.920
 And, you know, I think that's catalytic for me.

1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:17.400
 Like, I feel that mortality each day.

1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:22.680
 And my goal is to tell as many of these stories

1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:27.840
 before I'm gone.

1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:30.980
 Could you speak to the getting access?

1:05:30.980 --> 1:05:35.980
 Is this just, you know, is there interesting stories

1:05:36.180 --> 1:05:41.180
 of how a weird or funny or profound ways

1:05:43.020 --> 1:05:45.100
 that led you to get access to a room?

1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:46.780
 Each one is a different adventure.

1:05:46.780 --> 1:05:48.100
 And it's definitely an adventure.

1:05:48.100 --> 1:05:49.700
 Everyone's an adventure, yeah.

1:05:49.700 --> 1:05:51.820
 Probably one of the easiest ones I ever had

1:05:51.820 --> 1:05:54.980
 in the recent past was for 50 feet from Syria

1:05:54.980 --> 1:05:59.980
 where, you know, I literally broke my hand

1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:03.660
 in a bicycle race and after many months

1:06:03.660 --> 1:06:06.060
 of trying to get an appointment

1:06:06.060 --> 1:06:09.220
 with an orthopedic hand surgeon, you know, a specialist,

1:06:09.220 --> 1:06:11.700
 I finally did and he was Syrian American.

1:06:11.700 --> 1:06:14.860
 And the Syrian conflict had just begun

1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:16.660
 and we'd started talking about it.

1:06:16.660 --> 1:06:19.940
 And after, you know, he looked at my hand

1:06:19.940 --> 1:06:21.380
 in the first five minutes, he's like,

1:06:21.380 --> 1:06:22.740
 yeah, you need surgery, right?

1:06:22.740 --> 1:06:23.580
 Oh, great.

1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:25.900
 But then somehow we started talking about Syria.

1:06:25.900 --> 1:06:28.420
 And like five minutes in, he just stood up

1:06:28.420 --> 1:06:30.700
 and like put the privacy curtain around us.

1:06:30.700 --> 1:06:33.020
 It's supposed to be a 15 minute appointment or so.

1:06:33.020 --> 1:06:35.340
 And we talked for an hour, right?

1:06:35.340 --> 1:06:38.100
 So, you know, those moments of sort

1:06:38.100 --> 1:06:40.820
 of mysterious confluence happen, right?

1:06:40.820 --> 1:06:43.340
 And I think you have to be open to them when they do happen.

1:06:43.340 --> 1:06:46.700
 Because I'm a storyteller, I'm always looking as well, right?

1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:50.060
 So because he then contacted me later

1:06:50.060 --> 1:06:52.820
 and said, sky, I am going back to the Syrian border

1:06:52.820 --> 1:06:55.260
 to volunteer as a surgeon.

1:06:55.260 --> 1:06:56.540
 Do you want to come with me?

1:06:56.540 --> 1:06:57.420
 That was an easy one.

1:06:57.420 --> 1:06:58.940
 That's probably the easiest one I could give you.

1:06:58.940 --> 1:07:01.180
 But it came out of this interesting moment,

1:07:01.180 --> 1:07:02.860
 very personal moment, right?

1:07:02.860 --> 1:07:05.780
 Lifeboat and hunger ward were completely different.

1:07:07.340 --> 1:07:12.340
 And I had to really work hard to gain access to those stories.

1:07:12.340 --> 1:07:14.300
 So you intentionally thought like what,

1:07:15.780 --> 1:07:18.300
 I want to get access to the story.

1:07:18.300 --> 1:07:20.460
 And then what are the different ideas?

1:07:20.460 --> 1:07:24.460
 And they often might involve a doctor or a dentist

1:07:24.460 --> 1:07:29.460
 or just being maybe intentionally and aggressively open

1:07:31.140 --> 1:07:34.300
 to experiences that lead you into the room.

1:07:35.540 --> 1:07:38.860
 So like, it's funny you mentioned the doctor

1:07:38.860 --> 1:07:41.700
 because I have similar experiences now.

1:07:42.700 --> 1:07:47.700
 I've just gotten access to all kinds of fascinating people

1:07:47.980 --> 1:07:49.900
 in the same way.

1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:51.220
 They're all around us.

1:07:51.220 --> 1:07:52.060
 They're all around us.

1:07:52.060 --> 1:07:53.580
 You just have to look, right?

1:07:53.580 --> 1:07:55.540
 It's like, there's fascinating people everywhere

1:07:55.540 --> 1:07:57.260
 who are doing incredible things,

1:07:57.260 --> 1:07:59.460
 but we have to be open and keep our eyes open

1:07:59.460 --> 1:08:04.460
 and realize that there are amazing human beings everywhere.

1:08:04.620 --> 1:08:09.100
 There's networks that connect people just through life.

1:08:09.100 --> 1:08:12.540
 You meet people, you share a beer or a drink

1:08:12.540 --> 1:08:17.540
 or just fall in love or you share trauma together.

1:08:18.620 --> 1:08:21.260
 You go through a hard time to get in those little sticky

1:08:21.260 --> 1:08:22.580
 things, connects us humans.

1:08:22.580 --> 1:08:24.860
 And if you just keep yourself open

1:08:24.860 --> 1:08:27.940
 and embrace the curiosity

1:08:27.940 --> 1:08:30.060
 and then also the persistence, I suppose.

1:08:30.060 --> 1:08:35.060
 Like how long have you chased access?

1:08:36.180 --> 1:08:39.660
 Does it take days, weeks, months, years?

1:08:39.660 --> 1:08:43.100
 Lex, I'm not the most talented filmmaker in the world.

1:08:43.100 --> 1:08:46.180
 I'm not the smartest guy in the world.

1:08:46.180 --> 1:08:49.420
 I think if there's qualities that have served me well

1:08:49.420 --> 1:08:53.220
 in my career, it's persistence and tenacity, right?

1:08:53.220 --> 1:08:56.940
 I've always been sort of a slow burn human being.

1:08:56.940 --> 1:09:00.260
 Like I would never hit a home run,

1:09:00.260 --> 1:09:03.260
 but I hit a first, right?

1:09:03.260 --> 1:09:06.580
 A single to first and then I'd hit another single to first.

1:09:06.580 --> 1:09:09.500
 So, I ran a marathon when I was 18

1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:12.540
 and I think that is illustrative of sort of

1:09:12.540 --> 1:09:14.500
 how my career has been.

1:09:14.500 --> 1:09:18.380
 I just keep going and I believe in this notion

1:09:18.380 --> 1:09:22.780
 of incremental evolution that with each project,

1:09:22.780 --> 1:09:25.980
 I try to learn from it and take away lessons learned

1:09:25.980 --> 1:09:28.220
 and improve my craft, right?

1:09:28.220 --> 1:09:33.020
 And improve how I leverage that craft

1:09:33.020 --> 1:09:35.340
 and improve how I tell the story

1:09:35.340 --> 1:09:37.900
 from a narrative standpoint each time

1:09:37.900 --> 1:09:41.820
 so that on the next project, it's a little bit better.

1:09:41.820 --> 1:09:44.620
 And that's the arc of my career is learning,

1:09:44.620 --> 1:09:47.460
 learning, evolving, evolving

1:09:47.460 --> 1:09:50.540
 so that I can make a little better film the next time.

1:09:50.540 --> 1:09:52.460
 How do you gain people's trust?

1:09:53.300 --> 1:09:56.660
 Like for example, there's a line between journalists

1:09:56.660 --> 1:09:58.700
 and documentary filmmakers.

1:09:58.700 --> 1:10:00.460
 Nobody really trusts journalists.

1:10:00.460 --> 1:10:03.860
 Yeah, right, exactly.

1:10:03.860 --> 1:10:08.780
 But a documentary filmmaker, of course I'm joking,

1:10:08.780 --> 1:10:10.980
 half joking, I don't know which percentage joking,

1:10:10.980 --> 1:10:12.220
 but some truth.

1:10:12.220 --> 1:10:15.580
 But documentary filmmaker is a kind of storyteller

1:10:15.580 --> 1:10:18.900
 and artist that somehow that's more trustworthy

1:10:18.900 --> 1:10:22.580
 because you're on the same side in some way.

1:10:22.580 --> 1:10:23.420
 I don't know.

1:10:23.420 --> 1:10:25.380
 Maybe, maybe, maybe.

1:10:25.380 --> 1:10:26.620
 Is there something to be said

1:10:26.620 --> 1:10:29.580
 how you gain the trust of people to gain access?

1:10:29.580 --> 1:10:32.820
 Are you just trying to be a good human being?

1:10:34.180 --> 1:10:35.580
 Is there something to be said there?

1:10:35.580 --> 1:10:37.380
 Well, so I do draw a distinction

1:10:37.380 --> 1:10:40.100
 between journalism and filmmaking

1:10:40.100 --> 1:10:42.540
 because I think you're right, they're different.

1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:46.660
 And there are some filmmakers who do hue to sort of

1:10:46.660 --> 1:10:49.620
 the journalistic tenets of who, what, where, when, why,

1:10:49.620 --> 1:10:51.380
 fair and balanced on both sides, right?

1:10:51.380 --> 1:10:52.780
 Make sure everyone has a voice.

1:10:52.780 --> 1:10:53.620
 I don't.

1:10:53.620 --> 1:10:55.100
 If you say fair and balanced,

1:10:55.100 --> 1:10:58.300
 you're rarely either fair or balanced.

1:10:58.300 --> 1:10:59.660
 I've seen that with journalists.

1:10:59.660 --> 1:11:02.820
 Journalists often, unfortunately, in my perspective,

1:11:02.820 --> 1:11:05.540
 sorry to interrupt you rudely and go on a rant,

1:11:05.540 --> 1:11:09.780
 but they seem to have an agenda,

1:11:09.780 --> 1:11:12.140
 as opposed to seeking to truly tell a story

1:11:12.140 --> 1:11:13.500
 or to truly understand,

1:11:15.700 --> 1:11:18.060
 especially when they're talking to people

1:11:21.260 --> 1:11:24.220
 who have some degree of evil on them.

1:11:24.220 --> 1:11:25.740
 Well, we all have an agenda, right?

1:11:25.740 --> 1:11:27.020
 I think in anything we do,

1:11:27.020 --> 1:11:30.460
 whether it's like to seek truth

1:11:30.460 --> 1:11:32.700
 or some larger principle.

1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:33.700
 Sure.

1:11:33.700 --> 1:11:35.780
 I always have an agenda.

1:11:35.780 --> 1:11:40.020
 Like I chose to work with civilians and caretakers

1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:44.660
 in Yemen on hunger ward rather than to go interview MBS, right?

1:11:45.820 --> 1:11:46.900
 That's what I'm interested in,

1:11:46.900 --> 1:11:49.260
 is bringing that to the world, right?

1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:55.540
 But in terms of building relationships and trust,

1:11:55.820 --> 1:11:59.100
 it's really, I think about transparency

1:11:59.100 --> 1:12:00.700
 as much as anything else

1:12:00.700 --> 1:12:03.340
 and going in in a collaborative sense.

1:12:03.340 --> 1:12:08.340
 So I don't think of the people that I film with as subjects,

1:12:11.380 --> 1:12:14.340
 for example, I think of them as collaborators.

1:12:14.340 --> 1:12:17.700
 So it's a different mindset that I go into projects with.

1:12:17.700 --> 1:12:18.540
 That's beautiful.

1:12:18.540 --> 1:12:19.900
 And it's based on relationships, right?

1:12:19.900 --> 1:12:22.300
 You have to build relationships with other human beings,

1:12:22.300 --> 1:12:23.300
 however you can.

1:12:23.300 --> 1:12:28.300
 And that takes time and it takes listening and it's active.

1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:32.940
 So I've talked about the notion of consent before,

1:12:32.940 --> 1:12:36.660
 which is so important in nonfiction film.

1:12:36.660 --> 1:12:41.660
 And I hew to this idea that you don't just slide a piece

1:12:43.380 --> 1:12:45.140
 of paper in front of someone,

1:12:45.140 --> 1:12:47.220
 have a lease form and have them sign it, right?

1:12:47.220 --> 1:12:48.540
 And then you're done.

1:12:48.540 --> 1:12:51.740
 That's not the nature of true consent in my mind.

1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:56.740
 It's you have to work on a foundation of active consent

1:12:56.780 --> 1:12:59.260
 every single day that you're working with someone.

1:12:59.260 --> 1:13:01.300
 And that's based on relationship, right?

1:13:01.300 --> 1:13:02.540
 And it's based on dialogue.

1:13:02.540 --> 1:13:05.860
 So it's trust that I'm always aiming for.

1:13:05.860 --> 1:13:07.780
 It's the building of relationships

1:13:07.780 --> 1:13:08.660
 which I'm always aiming for,

1:13:08.660 --> 1:13:13.180
 which is why yesterday I got a bunch of photos

1:13:13.180 --> 1:13:15.340
 from Dr. Al Sadiq in the south of Yemen.

1:13:15.340 --> 1:13:18.100
 And she sends me photos all the time of the children

1:13:18.100 --> 1:13:19.940
 that she's currently treating

1:13:19.940 --> 1:13:23.180
 because we have an active relationship that continues on

1:13:23.180 --> 1:13:26.180
 and probably will for many years to come.

1:13:26.180 --> 1:13:28.340
 So that it's going to continue.

1:13:28.340 --> 1:13:32.020
 And that's the only way that I can do these kinds of films.

1:13:32.020 --> 1:13:36.740
 Let me ask you about silly little details of filming.

1:13:36.740 --> 1:13:41.420
 Before we go to the big picture stories,

1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:46.060
 cameras, lenses, how much do those matter?

1:13:46.060 --> 1:13:47.900
 You mentioned director of photography.

1:13:47.900 --> 1:13:52.900
 What's your, how much do you love the feel,

1:13:53.380 --> 1:13:56.940
 the smell of equipment that does the visual filming?

1:13:56.940 --> 1:13:59.180
 You know, there's some people, they're just like,

1:13:59.180 --> 1:14:03.100
 oh, they love lenses.

1:14:03.100 --> 1:14:04.740
 How much do you love that?

1:14:04.740 --> 1:14:07.260
 Or versus how much do you focus on the story

1:14:07.260 --> 1:14:08.980
 or the access and all those kinds of things?

1:14:08.980 --> 1:14:10.300
 I'm not a tech geek,

1:14:11.220 --> 1:14:15.340
 but because during the bulk of my career,

1:14:16.780 --> 1:14:19.060
 I've worked as a director of photography myself

1:14:19.060 --> 1:14:22.380
 for other people in order to pay the bills over the years.

1:14:23.260 --> 1:14:25.660
 You know, I know the technical side of it

1:14:25.660 --> 1:14:27.260
 because I've had to know it

1:14:27.260 --> 1:14:29.620
 and I've had to train myself and learn it.

1:14:29.620 --> 1:14:33.700
 So I see them as necessary tools.

1:14:33.700 --> 1:14:38.460
 And again, because I believe, you know,

1:14:38.460 --> 1:14:43.100
 film and cinema is and should be visually driven

1:14:43.100 --> 1:14:45.660
 and not verbally driven.

1:14:45.660 --> 1:14:49.420
 I want the best tools possible within my means, right?

1:14:49.420 --> 1:14:53.820
 And within the logistical ability of the project

1:14:53.820 --> 1:14:56.180
 because we have to go so small, right?

1:14:56.180 --> 1:15:00.820
 I can't afford nor can I bring a huge $100,000 lens.

1:15:00.820 --> 1:15:02.780
 So if I give you a trillion dollars.

1:15:02.780 --> 1:15:03.820
 A trillion dollars?

1:15:03.820 --> 1:15:06.780
 Yeah, unlimited.

1:15:06.780 --> 1:15:08.020
 There's still huge constraints

1:15:08.020 --> 1:15:11.140
 that have nothing to do with money, like you just said.

1:15:11.140 --> 1:15:13.820
 So what cameras would you use?

1:15:13.820 --> 1:15:16.020
 You know what I'd do with the trillion dollars?

1:15:16.020 --> 1:15:17.980
 I could do a lot with the trillion dollars.

1:15:17.980 --> 1:15:20.460
 You're only allowed to fund the film

1:15:20.460 --> 1:15:23.580
 and no corrupt stuff where you like use the film

1:15:23.580 --> 1:15:24.900
 to actually help children.

1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:26.420
 No, you're not allowed to do any of that.

1:15:26.420 --> 1:15:28.540
 What I would do with the trillion is I wouldn't invest in it.

1:15:28.540 --> 1:15:29.860
 Well, I guess I would invest in current.

1:15:29.860 --> 1:15:33.980
 I would increase capacity to do more films, what I would do.

1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:37.740
 So I would buy basically the perfect little,

1:15:37.740 --> 1:15:40.740
 you know, mini equipment set, right?

1:15:40.740 --> 1:15:43.980
 But then I would train three teams maybe

1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:45.980
 to do the same thing that I've been doing

1:15:45.980 --> 1:15:48.340
 so we could multiply and scale up.

1:15:48.340 --> 1:15:49.300
 More and more stories.

1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.020
 Yeah, that's what I would do with the money.

1:15:51.020 --> 1:15:52.500
 But the actual setup.

1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:55.140
 Would remain small and nimble, yeah.

1:15:56.620 --> 1:15:59.820
 And what about lighting?

1:15:59.820 --> 1:16:01.780
 Do you usually use natural light?

1:16:01.780 --> 1:16:03.140
 Do you ever do?

1:16:04.260 --> 1:16:06.300
 I mean, sorry for the technical questions here,

1:16:06.300 --> 1:16:11.300
 but highlighting the drama of the human face,

1:16:13.940 --> 1:16:15.580
 that's the visual, that's art.

1:16:15.580 --> 1:16:20.580
 That's like to reveal reality at its deepest

1:16:20.580 --> 1:16:23.060
 at its deepest is art.

1:16:23.060 --> 1:16:24.780
 And do you use lighting?

1:16:24.780 --> 1:16:26.380
 The lighting is such a big part of that.

1:16:26.380 --> 1:16:28.460
 Do you ever do artificial lighting?

1:16:28.460 --> 1:16:30.100
 Do you try to do natural always?

1:16:30.100 --> 1:16:33.220
 You know, the best lighting instrument in the world

1:16:33.220 --> 1:16:36.940
 is the sun at the right moment of the day.

1:16:36.940 --> 1:16:40.780
 And so I predominantly use natural light

1:16:43.980 --> 1:16:48.140
 at certain moments and just shape natural light

1:16:48.140 --> 1:16:51.780
 during the course of these small human ride stocks.

1:16:51.780 --> 1:16:54.740
 That's not to say we don't bring instruments sometimes,

1:16:54.740 --> 1:16:59.740
 but when we do, they're very small and again compact.

1:17:00.100 --> 1:17:05.100
 So for example, I have this small little tube kit.

1:17:05.420 --> 1:17:07.100
 That's just three instruments, right?

1:17:07.100 --> 1:17:08.460
 That you can charge with the USB

1:17:08.460 --> 1:17:11.980
 because electricity is often a major issue where we go.

1:17:11.980 --> 1:17:13.580
 So there's just three little tube lights

1:17:13.580 --> 1:17:16.900
 with magnetic backs that if we find in a situation

1:17:16.900 --> 1:17:19.300
 where we can't get enough exposure

1:17:19.300 --> 1:17:21.980
 for a hallway or something and we have the time

1:17:21.980 --> 1:17:24.300
 to throw it up, we'll throw it up if people are walking,

1:17:24.300 --> 1:17:27.180
 if collaborators are walking down that hallway a lot,

1:17:27.180 --> 1:17:30.020
 for example, at night, just so we can see them, right?

1:17:30.020 --> 1:17:33.740
 So it's instances like that or if we do do an interview

1:17:33.740 --> 1:17:36.540
 which we don't do very often, but if we do,

1:17:36.540 --> 1:17:40.780
 just so we have a key light on the face, right?

1:17:40.780 --> 1:17:43.420
 And I always bring a reflector or two,

1:17:43.420 --> 1:17:46.860
 just to shape natural light as well in ways.

1:17:46.860 --> 1:17:51.860
 But it's about shaping rather than producing light for us.

1:17:53.060 --> 1:17:53.900
 Got it.

1:17:53.900 --> 1:17:55.900
 As we sit surrounded by black curtains

1:17:55.900 --> 1:17:57.620
 in complete natural light.

1:17:57.620 --> 1:18:02.620
 So just so you know, this room is like a violation

1:18:04.980 --> 1:18:08.500
 of the basic principles of using the sun.

1:18:08.500 --> 1:18:13.140
 So behind the large curtains are giant windows.

1:18:13.140 --> 1:18:13.980
 Yeah.

1:18:13.980 --> 1:18:14.980
 So this whole.

1:18:14.980 --> 1:18:17.820
 Should I rip them open, or should I rip off the curtains?

1:18:17.820 --> 1:18:19.060
 Okay.

1:18:19.060 --> 1:18:21.380
 How much of the work is done in the edit?

1:18:21.380 --> 1:18:24.260
 That's another question I'm curious about.

1:18:24.260 --> 1:18:28.860
 And how much do you sort of anticipate that?

1:18:28.860 --> 1:18:30.700
 Like when you're actually shooting,

1:18:31.700 --> 1:18:35.700
 are you thinking of the final story

1:18:35.700 --> 1:18:37.980
 as it appears on screen,

1:18:37.980 --> 1:18:40.820
 or are you just collecting as a human,

1:18:40.820 --> 1:18:42.940
 collecting little bits of story here and there

1:18:42.940 --> 1:18:46.580
 and in the edit is where most of the storytelling happens?

1:18:46.580 --> 1:18:50.140
 I've developed this sort of mental paradigm for myself

1:18:50.140 --> 1:18:53.980
 over the years that speaks to that.

1:18:53.980 --> 1:18:56.780
 And I call it the three creations, right?

1:18:56.780 --> 1:18:59.340
 And so when I'm doing a film,

1:18:59.340 --> 1:19:03.020
 the first creation for me is, you know,

1:19:03.020 --> 1:19:05.900
 my preconception or visualization

1:19:05.900 --> 1:19:09.460
 of what the film is going to be before I shoot it, right?

1:19:09.460 --> 1:19:14.460
 So I have this entire vision of what a film is going to be.

1:19:15.100 --> 1:19:16.980
 And sometimes it can be pretty specific,

1:19:16.980 --> 1:19:18.660
 like I'll think through the scenes,

1:19:18.660 --> 1:19:20.820
 if I know the locations and everything,

1:19:20.820 --> 1:19:24.460
 and I'll have this idea of what I'm going to create, right?

1:19:24.460 --> 1:19:26.780
 And then I'm there filming, right?

1:19:26.780 --> 1:19:29.820
 And always without fail,

1:19:29.820 --> 1:19:32.580
 reality is something altogether different

1:19:32.580 --> 1:19:33.940
 than what I thought it would be.

1:19:33.940 --> 1:19:35.540
 But it's still good to have the original idea.

1:19:35.540 --> 1:19:37.220
 Yeah, yeah, but if I tried to hold

1:19:37.220 --> 1:19:38.860
 to that original vision, right?

1:19:38.860 --> 1:19:42.380
 And to create a film out of that idea, they'd be crap.

1:19:42.380 --> 1:19:43.460
 All the films would be crap.

1:19:43.460 --> 1:19:46.220
 So I have to adapt, I have to evolve my approach

1:19:46.220 --> 1:19:49.900
 and then embrace what is actually occurring

1:19:49.900 --> 1:19:51.500
 with the people who are actually doing it,

1:19:51.500 --> 1:19:53.100
 and then reenvision.

1:19:53.100 --> 1:19:55.220
 So that reenvision is very active

1:19:55.220 --> 1:19:57.140
 during the entire filming process.

1:19:57.140 --> 1:19:58.980
 And so that's the second creation.

1:19:58.980 --> 1:20:02.900
 That's the rethinking and revisualizing

1:20:02.900 --> 1:20:05.740
 based on what we're actually experiencing and seeing

1:20:05.740 --> 1:20:08.020
 what this film is going to be.

1:20:08.020 --> 1:20:11.420
 And then I finish filming, right?

1:20:11.420 --> 1:20:13.100
 And we bring the hard drives back

1:20:13.100 --> 1:20:16.660
 and we plug in the hard drives in the edit bay.

1:20:16.660 --> 1:20:20.460
 And oftentimes, because it's two of us filming

1:20:20.460 --> 1:20:23.740
 most of the time, I haven't seen all the footage.

1:20:23.740 --> 1:20:26.940
 Because in the field, it's all about just filming, right?

1:20:26.940 --> 1:20:28.780
 And then just transferring the footage

1:20:28.780 --> 1:20:31.860
 and getting on safely cloned to multiple drives.

1:20:31.860 --> 1:20:33.620
 I don't have a chance to review everything.

1:20:33.620 --> 1:20:36.420
 I can't do rushes like you do on a large feature.

1:20:36.420 --> 1:20:38.500
 So because I'm filming half of it,

1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:40.820
 I know what I've filmed, right?

1:20:40.820 --> 1:20:42.220
 But I haven't seen everything

1:20:42.220 --> 1:20:45.100
 the director photography has filmed, right?

1:20:45.100 --> 1:20:47.980
 So the next stage for me is reviewing

1:20:47.980 --> 1:20:52.060
 every single frame of what's been filmed.

1:20:52.060 --> 1:20:56.180
 And that's where discovery happens the third time, right?

1:20:56.180 --> 1:20:58.660
 Or second time, rather, is, wow,

1:20:58.660 --> 1:21:01.700
 now I thought we'd filmed this,

1:21:01.700 --> 1:21:05.180
 but actually there's this over here.

1:21:05.180 --> 1:21:07.540
 And then I have to open up this second vision

1:21:07.540 --> 1:21:10.180
 and turn it and transform it into a third vision

1:21:10.180 --> 1:21:13.020
 for the film based on what's actually on the hard drive.

1:21:13.020 --> 1:21:15.740
 So is this like a daily process?

1:21:15.740 --> 1:21:19.380
 So what I do, my process is that once,

1:21:19.380 --> 1:21:21.060
 if it's a really difficult project,

1:21:21.060 --> 1:21:23.420
 I'll take a break before I go through this.

1:21:23.420 --> 1:21:27.380
 Just for healing and some space away and fresh eyes.

1:21:27.380 --> 1:21:29.100
 And usually that's about a month.

1:21:29.100 --> 1:21:32.500
 And then once I reengage, I reengage whole hog.

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:37.180
 I reengage fully and I review every single frame.

1:21:37.180 --> 1:21:40.620
 And as I do that, I create a spreadsheet.

1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:43.300
 And for Hunger War, that spreadsheet was,

1:21:43.300 --> 1:21:45.940
 I don't know, 1500 lines long or something

1:21:45.940 --> 1:21:48.140
 where it's basically log notes.

1:21:48.140 --> 1:21:51.380
 And I watch every scene and I take notes

1:21:51.380 --> 1:21:54.220
 and I know really what we have.

1:21:54.220 --> 1:21:55.940
 And once I've gone through that process

1:21:55.940 --> 1:21:57.380
 that takes about a month

1:21:57.380 --> 1:21:59.900
 and I really know what we came back with,

1:21:59.900 --> 1:22:02.780
 I create an outline for the film from that.

1:22:02.780 --> 1:22:04.740
 And that's the third visioning, right?

1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:07.580
 That's usually completely different

1:22:07.580 --> 1:22:10.780
 than my original vision for the film to some extent, right?

1:22:10.780 --> 1:22:14.300
 But I have to stay open to that entire process

1:22:15.300 --> 1:22:17.060
 or I'd be trying to create something

1:22:17.060 --> 1:22:19.660
 that I can't really create.

1:22:19.660 --> 1:22:22.700
 So I think that those are the three creations for me.

1:22:22.700 --> 1:22:25.840
 That's so cool to know what we have.

1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:30.840
 Just to lay it all out and to load it in into your mind.

1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:35.840
 Cause like this is the capture of reality we have.

1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:37.840
 It's a very kind of scientific process too.

1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:39.480
 Cause you know, in science,

1:22:39.480 --> 1:22:41.880
 you collect a bunch of data about a phenomena.

1:22:41.880 --> 1:22:43.720
 And now you have to like analyze that data.

1:22:43.720 --> 1:22:46.080
 But now your phenomena is long gone.

1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:46.920
 Yeah, yeah, right, right.

1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:47.760
 Now you just have the data.

1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:50.800
 Just the data and you have to write a paper

1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:52.240
 about it, like analyze the data.

1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:54.000
 It's the similar things.

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:55.440
 You have to like load it all in.

1:22:55.440 --> 1:22:56.920
 Where's the story?

1:22:56.920 --> 1:23:01.920
 How, how do you, that last probably profound piece

1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:07.040
 of doing the editing like in your mind?

1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:10.200
 Like what, how to lay those things out?

1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:12.200
 Well, it's almost like the scientific process, right?

1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:15.320
 I have a hypothesis, a creative hypothesis, right?

1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:17.040
 Not a scientific one.

1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:19.080
 But then I'm testing the hypothesis

1:23:19.080 --> 1:23:20.960
 during the course of filming, right?

1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:24.280
 And I have to stay true to what the data tells me

1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:25.760
 in the end, creatively.

1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:27.560
 So it's very similar to the scientific processes.

1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:30.240
 I don't know what we should, we should probably coin that.

1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:31.240
 Yeah, that's pretty good.

1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:34.680
 Creative scientific process or something like that.

1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:38.280
 But then you actually do the edit and then you watch,

1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:41.320
 that's also iterative in a sense.

1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:45.240
 Cause maybe when you have a film,

1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:48.480
 that's 20, 30, 40 minutes, or if it's feature line,

1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:53.480
 like, do you ever have it where it sucks?

1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:55.480
 Like it's not at all.

1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:56.760
 Is there a stage where it sucks?

1:23:56.760 --> 1:24:01.440
 Like a stage where it's like, no, this is not hot.

1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:02.800
 This is not what I was.

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:04.640
 Like when it's all put together in this way,

1:24:04.640 --> 1:24:07.040
 this doesn't, this is not working right.

1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:08.840
 This is not right.

1:24:08.840 --> 1:24:12.160
 Or do you, is it always like an incremental step

1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:13.080
 towards better and better?

1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:14.000
 It's incremental.

1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:14.960
 Yeah, it's incremental.

1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:16.920
 Yeah, and there's always some moment

1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:20.000
 in the editing process where there's a breakthrough,

1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:24.400
 where suddenly I understand how it fits together more fully.

1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:26.160
 And you have to be, like you said, resilient.

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:28.600
 You have to be patient that that moment will come.

1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:29.440
 Yeah, exactly.

1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:31.480
 Are you ultra self critical?

1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:35.440
 Or are you generally optimistic and patient?

1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:38.560
 I don't think those are mutually exclusive.

1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:40.320
 Right, so you just oscillate?

1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:42.480
 Or you, are there like dance partners or something?

1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:44.200
 No, dance partners, yeah.

1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:47.440
 Definitely dance, all the way through the process.

1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:52.760
 By way of advice, to young filmmakers,

1:24:52.760 --> 1:24:59.080
 how to film something that is recognized by the world

1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:00.680
 in some way.

1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:05.400
 I would say, first off, learn your craft.

1:25:05.400 --> 1:25:11.400
 Because I think craft is incredibly foundational

1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:14.480
 to creating a powerful story.

1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:16.560
 And sorry to interrupt, but when you say craft,

1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:18.760
 do you mean just the raw technical,

1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:21.800
 the director of photography, the filming aspect?

1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:24.520
 Is it the storytelling, is it the acts, is the whole thing?

1:25:24.520 --> 1:25:25.960
 I think craft is more than just knowing

1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:28.760
 how to push record on a camera or what lens to use.

1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:30.480
 That's part of it, right?

1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:35.400
 But I think, at least in nonfiction,

1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:40.040
 I'm a product to some extent of having

1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:44.280
 to know how to do it all, having to teach myself how

1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:44.720
 to do it all.

1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:47.960
 Because I didn't go to film school,

1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:54.560
 but I became so enamored of telling stories through a camera.

1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:57.920
 What was the leap, by the way, from theater to storyteller?

1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:00.880
 Oh, I just needed an extra class in grad school.

1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:04.960
 I was in a MFA directing class, and I needed an extra class.

1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:09.680
 And I just talked my way into a television directing class.

1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:11.640
 And fell in love with it.

1:26:11.640 --> 1:26:14.120
 And the actor became the director.

1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:15.440
 Yeah.

1:26:15.440 --> 1:26:16.440
 Well, yeah.

1:26:16.440 --> 1:26:19.920
 I mean, I wasn't an actor, but I had to act.

1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:23.120
 I had to know the craft of acting because I was in the theater.

1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:24.680
 Did you love it, though?

1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:26.280
 Did you love acting?

1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:26.960
 The theater?

1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:28.120
 Yeah, theater.

1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:30.800
 The first, yeah, as an undergraduate, yeah.

1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:34.000
 But then I learned pretty quickly that I was pretty bad at it,

1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:39.280
 or at least not very good, and that my skills lay elsewhere.

1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:42.480
 And more behind the scenes and shaping a story.

1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:47.440
 When you started taking a class, but also telling stories

1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:53.720
 as a director, did you quickly realize that you're pretty good at this,

1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:56.000
 or was it a grind?

1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.640
 That's a good question, Alex.

1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:05.400
 I think I definitely knew right away that it was more my wheelhouse.

1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:10.360
 And I think part of that was because I grew up

1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:14.120
 in sort of a world of imagination.

1:27:14.120 --> 1:27:18.680
 And I think that act of imagination as a child really

1:27:18.680 --> 1:27:23.920
 lent itself well to the skill set that a director needs, right?

1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:26.720
 To shape story, to shape narrative, to shape performances.

1:27:26.720 --> 1:27:29.600
 So I think it was a much more natural fit for me.

1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:31.800
 Was I excellent at the beginning?

1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:33.560
 Heck, no, no.

1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:35.120
 I think few people are.

1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:35.960
 But I learned.

1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:37.880
 Where was the biggest struggle for you?

1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:43.520
 So your imagination clearly was something that you worked on for a lifetime.

1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:46.440
 So I'm sure that was pretty strong.

1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:47.840
 Books, came from books.

1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:49.280
 Books.

1:27:49.280 --> 1:27:53.920
 But the actual conversion of the, you said shape the story.

1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:59.040
 Where was the skill most lacking in the shaping of the story initially?

1:27:59.040 --> 1:27:59.880
 Technical side.

1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:00.560
 Just technical side.

1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:03.800
 Yeah, you know, because I taught myself everything.

1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:05.640
 What kind of microphone should I use, right?

1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:06.400
 What kind of camera?

1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:07.560
 What does this lens do?

1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:08.720
 What's that lens do?

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:10.080
 I didn't know any of that.

1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:14.240
 And so I essentially was, I have been self taught technically.

1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:15.600
 How do you get good technically?

1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:16.840
 Would you say when you're self taught?

1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:18.200
 Just doing it over and over again.

1:28:18.200 --> 1:28:20.120
 And what kind of stories were you telling?

1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:20.840
 Like, like.

1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:24.280
 I began shooting local commercials for.

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:25.120
 For money.

1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:25.680
 For money.

1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:26.200
 Yeah, yeah.

1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:27.800
 So you're doing professional projects.

1:28:27.800 --> 1:28:28.640
 Yeah, yeah.

1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:31.200
 And so I kind of learned on the job as I did it.

1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:34.000
 How many hobby projects did you do just for the hell of it?

1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.800
 Were you trying to focus on the professional?

1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:37.280
 Well, I was trying to make money, right?

1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:39.320
 Right out of grad school, just to pay the rent.

1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:42.360
 And then that, you know, that's a forcing function to.

1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:45.640
 I mean, I, I personally love having my back to the wall

1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:48.880
 or financially you're screwed to succeed.

1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:50.400
 So that's nice.

1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:52.720
 I mean, I lived out the trunk of my car for a couple of years

1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:54.840
 after grad school, just freelancing.

1:28:54.840 --> 1:28:59.440
 You know, just like, but, but that couple of years really helped me

1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:02.440
 learn fast because I had to learn fast, you know.

1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:05.840
 So I did a couple, I did a couple of voyages around the world

1:29:05.840 --> 1:29:08.880
 for this group called Semester at Sea that has a floating

1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:10.960
 university that where they go out three and a half months

1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:15.040
 at a time with the, with about 500 college level students

1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:16.680
 and about 35 professors.

1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:19.440
 And so you're shooting every day for three and a half months

1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:20.760
 in like nine different countries.

1:29:20.760 --> 1:29:25.680
 And so that really was like instrumental to me becoming

1:29:25.680 --> 1:29:27.680
 a pretty good camera person pretty quickly.

1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:29.240
 And you're doing most of the work yourself.

1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:30.800
 One man, one man bad.

1:29:30.800 --> 1:29:31.640
 Yeah.

1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:35.480
 The second, the second voyage, I at least had an editor with me.

1:29:35.480 --> 1:29:36.920
 Yeah, but I was shooting everything.

1:29:36.920 --> 1:29:37.760
 Yeah.

1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:38.800
 What's the perfect team?

1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:43.640
 Is it two people for the, for nonfiction, asking for a friend?

1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:44.480
 Yeah.

1:29:44.480 --> 1:29:48.320
 Some kind of interest in some storytelling, not of the level

1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:50.960
 and the sophistication that you're doing, but more.

1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:53.520
 I think you have to allow the story to dictate what the size

1:29:53.520 --> 1:29:54.360
 of the film should be.

1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:57.440
 For these small human rights docs I do, I think two or three,

1:29:57.440 --> 1:29:59.560
 you know, it means you work your butt off, right?

1:29:59.560 --> 1:30:01.360
 Cause you're doing everything, right?

1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:03.640
 But it allows you to tell intimate stories

1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:04.560
 and have that access.

1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:08.520
 I'm doing a film this summer that's a scripted piece

1:30:08.520 --> 1:30:10.520
 where we'll probably have 25 crew people.

1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:11.360
 Oh wow.

1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:12.920
 You know, so it's completely different,

1:30:12.920 --> 1:30:14.520
 different endeavor all together.

1:30:14.520 --> 1:30:18.560
 But doing it yourself, what do you think about that?

1:30:18.560 --> 1:30:21.360
 Even though you, you have that trillion dollars.

1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:23.040
 Oh, I have that trillion dollars again?

1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:23.880
 Sweet.

1:30:23.880 --> 1:30:25.200
 You can write that check before I leave, Brian.

1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:26.040
 Yeah, I will.

1:30:26.040 --> 1:30:27.640
 All right.

1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:30.320
 I've never seen a check for that big.

1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:31.160
 It's gonna be interesting.

1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:32.000
 How many zeros is that?

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:36.160
 I've read them so often I've lost track

1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:39.400
 or the United States government sure as heck writes them often.

1:30:39.400 --> 1:30:42.280
 Okay, anyway, I mean, like, is there an argument?

1:30:42.280 --> 1:30:44.560
 Can you steal man the case for a single person?

1:30:44.560 --> 1:30:47.800
 You know, not for me, not for me.

1:30:47.800 --> 1:30:49.400
 And here's why.

1:30:49.400 --> 1:30:54.400
 What I found is that by being a team of two filming

1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:03.760
 with a field producer, by two people filming,

1:31:05.640 --> 1:31:10.480
 it allows us to double our footage first off, right?

1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:13.240
 So we have twice as much footage in the time

1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:14.440
 we're filming to come back with

1:31:14.440 --> 1:31:15.880
 as opposed to one person filming.

1:31:15.880 --> 1:31:18.400
 So you're each manning a camera?

1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:19.880
 Yeah, constantly.

1:31:19.880 --> 1:31:22.760
 And how much, how much, sorry to keep interrupting,

1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:25.240
 but how much interaction and interplay there?

1:31:25.240 --> 1:31:28.200
 Sometimes the director of photography is in another room.

1:31:28.200 --> 1:31:30.040
 Filming at a different scene, if it makes sense.

1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:32.800
 Sometimes we're cross shooting in the same room, right?

1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:35.440
 It just depends on the needs of the moment.

1:31:35.440 --> 1:31:38.040
 So we come back with double footage is one thing.

1:31:38.040 --> 1:31:40.400
 But as a director, so that's, you know,

1:31:40.400 --> 1:31:45.240
 and given how access is sometimes shaped by the events

1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:48.360
 so that we can only, something, you know, in lifeboat,

1:31:48.360 --> 1:31:50.480
 for example, you know, a rescue operation

1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:52.880
 may only happen three days, right?

1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:55.000
 So you want as much footage of that as you can.

1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:57.360
 But the other piece of it that's really critical for me,

1:31:57.360 --> 1:32:00.360
 I found is that by having another human being

1:32:00.360 --> 1:32:02.760
 I'm filming with, who I'm co shooting with,

1:32:02.760 --> 1:32:05.080
 it frees me up as a director

1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:07.600
 to not always have to be shooting either.

1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:11.640
 I can do all the other work to build relationships, right?

1:32:11.640 --> 1:32:14.080
 To have side conversations with people,

1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:18.720
 to sort out the right way to tell a story, right?

1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:21.240
 Or to transfer footage, knowing that

1:32:21.240 --> 1:32:22.840
 the director of photography is still filming

1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:23.680
 during all that.

1:32:23.680 --> 1:32:26.520
 So it frees me up to think of it as a director

1:32:26.520 --> 1:32:30.000
 rather than just an image acquirer.

1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:32.320
 Yeah, cause there's also, I don't know how distracting

1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:33.800
 is you've obviously done it for years,

1:32:33.800 --> 1:32:38.800
 but setting stuff up, it preoccupies your mind.

1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:42.520
 Like pressing the record button.

1:32:42.520 --> 1:32:44.000
 And like framing stuff and all that,

1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:46.480
 that's still, that takes up some part of your mind

1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:48.280
 where you can't think freely.

1:32:48.280 --> 1:32:49.520
 That's my choice, right?

1:32:49.520 --> 1:32:51.080
 That's how I work best.

1:32:51.080 --> 1:32:53.080
 That said, the caveat there would be,

1:32:53.080 --> 1:32:55.040
 that's not the only way to do it obviously, right?

1:32:55.040 --> 1:32:57.640
 Like one of my favorite documentary time,

1:32:57.640 --> 1:33:01.440
 documentaries of all time is a documentary

1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:03.880
 called A Woman Captured Shot in Hungary

1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:07.120
 by a single filmmaker with a single camera,

1:33:07.120 --> 1:33:09.480
 with a single lens, right?

1:33:09.480 --> 1:33:13.880
 And it's brilliant and powerful and moving

1:33:13.880 --> 1:33:16.080
 and interventional.

1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:17.960
 It's incredible filmmaking.

1:33:17.960 --> 1:33:20.600
 And it was a single human being who created that film

1:33:20.600 --> 1:33:23.480
 with a collaborator or subject.

1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:26.800
 So it can be done, it's just not how I work best.

1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:30.000
 Yeah, how much personally with the other person,

1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:34.160
 how important is the relationship with them

1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:36.360
 outside of the filming?

1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:37.200
 Like...

1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:38.040
 With the director of photography?

1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:39.640
 The director of photography, say.

1:33:39.640 --> 1:33:44.480
 Like, how much drinking and if you don't drink

1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:46.080
 whatever the equivalent of that is,

1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:47.600
 they have to do together.

1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:50.400
 How much soul searching or is it more

1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:52.440
 like two surgeons getting together?

1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:55.960
 Is it surgeons or is it a jazz band?

1:33:55.960 --> 1:33:57.960
 Well, it could be either, right?

1:33:57.960 --> 1:33:59.240
 Hopefully not at the same time though,

1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:01.000
 because I don't think surgeons and jazz bands

1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:02.120
 go well together.

1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:02.960
 Probably.

1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:05.760
 They're both good with fingers I suppose.

1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:08.240
 Exactly, but I'd rather maybe not play in jazz

1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:09.920
 while they operate on me.

1:34:09.920 --> 1:34:14.920
 But I think for me, I think there are moments of both

1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:17.600
 but usually not at the same time, right?

1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:20.880
 There are surgical moments where the moment is so pressing

1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:25.040
 you really have to be that task driven, right?

1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:27.160
 To capture as thoroughly as possible

1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:29.360
 whatever's unfolding, right?

1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:31.840
 But I think there's other times where you do improvise

1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:32.920
 like jazz, right?

1:34:32.920 --> 1:34:35.960
 And where you have a lot of choices ahead of you

1:34:35.960 --> 1:34:38.800
 and you're doing it maybe a dance

1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:41.080
 with the other camera person, right?

1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:43.200
 In order to capture a scene as creatively

1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:47.440
 and fully as possible during a fixed duration.

1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:49.400
 How much you said shaping?

1:34:49.400 --> 1:34:51.360
 Because it is nonfiction.

1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:53.400
 But I feel like there's so many ways

1:34:53.400 --> 1:34:55.440
 to tell the same nonfiction

1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:57.840
 that it's bordering on fiction.

1:34:57.840 --> 1:34:58.680
 Yeah.

1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:03.680
 Well, it's storytelling and how much shaping

1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.880
 do you see yourself as doing?

1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:10.320
 Like how important is your role?

1:35:10.320 --> 1:35:11.680
 How you tell the story?

1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:16.480
 I suppose the question I'm asking is

1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:18.760
 how many ways can you really screw this up?

1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:22.000
 Every day you can screw it up.

1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:26.000
 I mean, that's really what I think what you're asking about

1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:29.560
 is actually the ethos of documentary filmmaking, right?

1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:32.640
 I allow a lot of things to guide my choices.

1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:38.120
 One of them being, am I being fair, right?

1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:39.760
 Not balanced, right?

1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:43.520
 But am I being fair to what I'm witnessing?

1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:46.480
 There's a camera capturing in a fair way

1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:48.600
 the truth of the reality.

1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:49.440
 Some fundamentals.

1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:51.640
 And it also speaks to consent, right?

1:35:51.640 --> 1:35:53.960
 Am I being fair in a sense of consent?

1:35:53.960 --> 1:35:56.480
 Do I have active consent in this moment, right?

1:35:56.480 --> 1:35:58.640
 Regardless of whether I have a signed piece of paper.

1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:00.360
 I always find some way to document it,

1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:02.440
 whether it's just direct address to camera

1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:05.520
 or a translated release.

1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:07.800
 So there's, actually that's an interesting little,

1:36:07.800 --> 1:36:10.640
 so they say something to the camera that they consent

1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:12.120
 or they sign the thing.

1:36:12.120 --> 1:36:16.800
 Yeah, so for example, the large broadcast companies

1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:18.360
 have this formalized process

1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:21.120
 where they present a piece of paper, right?

1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:21.960
 Yes.

1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:25.200
 The subject reads it and they sign it

1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:26.680
 and then you have permission.

1:36:26.680 --> 1:36:28.880
 And that's irrevocable, right?

1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:30.800
 So it'll hold up in court.

1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:32.840
 That's not how I'll operate, right?

1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:37.600
 And so it's just, for example,

1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:39.720
 that doesn't work if someone's illiterate

1:36:39.720 --> 1:36:42.000
 and can't read that piece of paper, right?

1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.320
 What if they don't know how to sign their name, right?

1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:46.360
 So instead you have to have a conversation,

1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:49.440
 ask questions, have them ask questions,

1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:51.600
 come to a complete understanding

1:36:51.600 --> 1:36:53.720
 before you even know whether they understand

1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:54.960
 what you're asking, right?

1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:57.240
 And then in that case, if someone's illiterate,

1:36:57.240 --> 1:36:58.880
 then you have that conversation,

1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:01.000
 you just sit down and it takes a long time sometimes,

1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:01.840
 but you have to do it.

1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:04.400
 And then if they still wanna participate

1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:06.560
 and they give you their consent,

1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:08.600
 they can't sign a piece of paper, right?

1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:11.800
 So then you just do in their native language, right?

1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:14.200
 Direct consent to camera in their language.

1:37:14.200 --> 1:37:15.040
 Interesting.

1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:16.320
 But also you're speaking to the consent

1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:19.680
 that's just a human placing trust in you.

1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:20.520
 Yeah.

1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:21.360
 You make a connection like this.

1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:23.240
 That's the most important consent, yeah.

1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:25.600
 I hate papers.

1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:28.840
 I hate papers and lawyers

1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:31.440
 because they did exactly for that reason.

1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:32.640
 Yeah, okay, great.

1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:37.080
 But you should be focusing on the human connection

1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:40.120
 that leads to the trust, to the real consent

1:37:40.120 --> 1:37:42.720
 and consent day to day, minute to minute

1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:43.760
 because that can change.

1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:44.880
 Absolutely.

1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:46.000
 And it does change.

1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:49.360
 You mentioned a woman captured.

1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:54.080
 I'm sure you can't answer that, but I will force you.

1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:58.320
 What are the top three documentaries of all time?

1:37:58.320 --> 1:37:59.880
 Short or feature length?

1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:02.440
 This is not your opinion.

1:38:02.440 --> 1:38:04.200
 This is objective truth.

1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:09.280
 Maybe the top one was the greatest.

1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:14.280
 We got, let's see, March of the Penguins

1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:15.840
 that's probably number one for me.

1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:16.680
 Really?

1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:17.520
 No, I'm just kidding.

1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:19.880
 I don't know, I do seem to,

1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:25.160
 the metaphor of penguins huddling together

1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:30.160
 in a hard, cold, like in the harsh conditions of nature

1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:34.960
 that that's something that's kind of beautiful.

1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:37.200
 I don't love all nature documentaries,

1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:40.440
 but like something about March of the Penguins,

1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:42.560
 I think Morgan Freeman.

1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:43.520
 Yeah, he narrated it.

1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:45.200
 Narrates it, so maybe everything,

1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:47.840
 just any documentary with Morgan Freeman,

1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:51.680
 Mama Sucker for that, Warner Herzog,

1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:54.200
 The Life in the Tyga, The Simple People.

1:38:54.200 --> 1:38:55.440
 I love Grizzly Man.

1:38:55.440 --> 1:38:56.960
 I love Grizzly Man.

1:38:56.960 --> 1:38:59.000
 I think that's one of his best works, you know?

1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:03.200
 Yes, I think that's Joe Rogan's favorite documentary.

1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:06.880
 It's both comedy and I mean it's...

1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:07.720
 Tragic comedy.

1:39:07.720 --> 1:39:09.920
 Tragic comedy, yeah.

1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:11.760
 Is there something that stands out to you?

1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:13.920
 I mean, I'm joking about like best,

1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:15.760
 something that was impactful to you.

1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:16.640
 Just to put it out there,

1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:19.040
 I don't think there's any way to say

1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:22.400
 that they're objectively the best three documentaries

1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:23.680
 all the time, but for me,

1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:25.680
 and you may find this interesting given your background,

1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:30.680
 is that I think my top three

1:39:30.680 --> 1:39:35.680
 are all from the Eastern Bloc, actually.

1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:39.680
 So Aquarella by Kosokovsky,

1:39:39.680 --> 1:39:42.000
 Victor Kosokovsky is one of my favorite,

1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:43.800
 and he's a couple of years old now,

1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:47.440
 which is sort of a meditation on the place water has

1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:49.120
 on our planet and on our lives.

1:39:50.600 --> 1:39:53.360
 I think a woman captured that I mentioned,

1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:54.560
 which was shot in Hungary.

1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:56.240
 Is a feature length one, right?

1:39:56.240 --> 1:39:58.520
 Both are feature lengths, yeah.

1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:00.560
 It is just brilliant,

1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:05.360
 and it I think has yet to find distribution here in the US,

1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:07.880
 but it's the perfect example of what they call,

1:40:07.880 --> 1:40:12.880
 you know, verite or direct nonfiction filmmaking.

1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:15.120
 A European woman, this is the synopsis,

1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:17.240
 a European woman has been kept by families,

1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:19.600
 a domestic slave for 10 years,

1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:23.040
 drawn courage from the filmmaker's presence.

1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:26.800
 She decides to escape the unbearable oppression

1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:28.120
 and become a free person.

1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:32.080
 Wow, so the filmmaker is part of the story.

1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:33.120
 Part of the story becomes,

1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:34.240
 and it didn't start that way,

1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:35.840
 but during the course of the story,

1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:39.040
 the filmmaker comes to understand

1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:41.400
 that this is actually modern day slavery.

1:40:41.400 --> 1:40:44.960
 And rather than just allow it to be,

1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:47.960
 actually enables and assists this woman

1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:50.520
 to free herself from slavery and become a free woman.

1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:52.160
 I wonder, I'm sorry, on a small tangent

1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:53.160
 before we get to number three,

1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:55.200
 like, Icarus is interesting too.

1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:00.480
 How often do you become part of the story?

1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:04.200
 Or the story is different because of your presence?

1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:09.680
 Like you changed the tide of history.

1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:12.720
 Yeah, well, back to just like one person at a time

1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:16.960
 that we keep coming back to that theme on some level.

1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:18.680
 So this could tie in,

1:41:18.680 --> 1:41:21.120
 interestingly, into one of my favorite films, actually.

1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:24.720
 So the last two films that I would mention

1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:26.640
 for my top four list would be,

1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:28.840
 the third Eastern block one would be a film

1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:31.920
 called Immortal in 2019,

1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:34.480
 which was shot in Russia by a Russian woman

1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:39.480
 that sort of, you know, examines the place of the state

1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:44.800
 in shaping individuals to be vehicles for the state.

1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:47.200
 I mean, that's my own synopsis,

1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:50.240
 but that's one of my takeaways from the brilliant

1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:52.440
 60 minute doc or so.

1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:57.440
 Again, Russian filmmaking is really quite good and powerful.

1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.720
 The fourth one would be a Frederick Wiseman film,

1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:05.720
 Titicott Follies, which was filmed in the US decades ago,

1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:10.000
 inside basically the bowels of an insane asylum

1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.040
 or a mental health institution.

1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:14.440
 And I bring up Wiseman because, you know,

1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:18.920
 he is really the godfather, so to speak,

1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:22.720
 of direct cinema or cinema verite.

1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:26.080
 And when early in my career,

1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:31.080
 I really believed in what he expressed as the place

1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:33.640
 of the verite filmmaker,

1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:37.080
 which is simply fly on the wall,

1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:41.800
 which is only observational in nature, right?

1:42:41.800 --> 1:42:44.960
 And I believe that that's how I should be

1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:46.280
 as a nonfiction filmmaker,

1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:49.440
 that I was there only to bear witness to observe

1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:53.000
 and not to intervene in any way, shape or form.

1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:57.040
 And that was the sort of foundation

1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:00.120
 for how I operate for many, many years.

1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:01.920
 And then some things happened.

1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:06.920
 So one of those things that happened was I film lifeboat.

1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:11.040
 And during the course of filming lifeboat,

1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:14.480
 which, you know, covered rescue operations

1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:16.640
 in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya,

1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:22.380
 in the first three days of that rescue mission,

1:43:22.380 --> 1:43:26.840
 you know, we came upon over 3,000 people,

1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:30.720
 asylum seekers, floating in flimsy rafts in the water.

1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:36.360
 And we were on the Zodiacs and we were filming.

1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:40.120
 And within the first couple hours, you know,

1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:45.120
 we would come up to these rafts and these boats

1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:47.680
 that were in really dire shape

1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:50.920
 and people would be pushed off and people would jump off

1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:53.200
 and people would fall into the water.

1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:57.480
 And some of them couldn't swim.

1:43:58.680 --> 1:44:01.160
 And so we found ourselves in this moment

1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:03.000
 where we had a choice.

1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:06.200
 We could film someone drowned in front of us,

1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:07.920
 or we could put our cameras down

1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:09.720
 and pull them out of the water.

1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:11.440
 And so that's what we did.

1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:14.640
 We put our cameras in the bottom of the Zodiac

1:44:14.640 --> 1:44:17.280
 and just started pulling people out of the water.

1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:21.560
 And, you know, if I was Wiseman, right,

1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.840
 according to his paradigm, then we should have just filmed.

1:44:25.840 --> 1:44:30.400
 And I didn't anticipate that moment beforehand.

1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:32.280
 I had no sort of foreknowledge

1:44:32.280 --> 1:44:35.680
 that I was gonna find myself faced with that dilemma

1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:38.160
 of the moment as a documentarian.

1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:39.880
 But there was no question in my mind

1:44:39.880 --> 1:44:41.200
 that I had to put my camera down

1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:43.720
 and pull that fellow human being out of the water.

1:44:43.720 --> 1:44:45.440
 And I don't regret it at all.

1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:46.880
 So I've come to a different place.

1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:49.120
 I've evolved to what I believe

1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:52.320
 for the kind of film that I do is more appropriate, right?

1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:56.720
 Like I can go to sleep at night knowing that

1:44:56.720 --> 1:44:58.440
 regardless of how the film would have been different

1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:00.720
 if I hadn't made that choice,

1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:02.760
 I made the right choice as a human being.

1:45:02.760 --> 1:45:05.400
 So I think of it as being a human being first

1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:08.320
 and a filmmaker second in moments like that.

1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:09.920
 That's beautifully, beautifully put.

1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:14.680
 But I also think you could be a human being in small ways,

1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:17.400
 too, like silly ways,

1:45:17.400 --> 1:45:21.000
 and put a little bit of yourself in documentaries.

1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:23.080
 I tend to see that as really beautiful.

1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:26.120
 Like the meta piece of it?

1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:31.040
 Yeah, just put yourself into the movie a little bit

1:45:31.040 --> 1:45:35.600
 because break that third, fourth, whatever the wall is

1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:38.840
 is realize that there's a human behind the camera too.

1:45:38.840 --> 1:45:41.720
 For some reason, me as a fan, as a viewer,

1:45:41.720 --> 1:45:42.960
 that's enjoyable too.

1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:47.800
 I think there's a real authenticity there behind the,

1:45:47.800 --> 1:45:49.800
 especially with these hard stories that you're doing

1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:53.080
 that there's a human being struggling to,

1:45:53.080 --> 1:45:56.400
 like observing the suffering

1:45:57.440 --> 1:46:02.440
 and having to bear the burden

1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:05.160
 that this kind of suffering exists in the world

1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:09.120
 and you're behind that camera living that struggle.

1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:12.440
 And there's small ways to show yourself in that way.

1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:16.560
 As you know, I don't do that in a big way.

1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:19.000
 But I actually, there are subtle moments

1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:23.240
 where I allow that presence to live just for a second.

1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:25.880
 Like, I hate belly button docs.

1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:26.720
 That's what I call them.

1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:27.560
 I don't know what it is.

1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:28.400
 What's a belly button?

1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:30.480
 A belly button doc is naval gazing, right?

1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:33.920
 Where it's sort of a narcissistic filmmaking

1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:38.840
 where someone just studies their own place in the world, right?

1:46:38.840 --> 1:46:43.840
 I think my, I'm more concerned with how I can intervene, right?

1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:49.840
 Yeah.

1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:52.640
 Well, you're trying to really deeply empathize.

1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:53.480
 Yeah.

1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:56.000
 So like, if you empathize, who am I?

1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:58.040
 I don't want to center myself in these stories.

1:46:58.040 --> 1:46:59.440
 It's not about me, right?

1:46:59.440 --> 1:47:01.160
 I am so unimportant.

1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:03.720
 What is important is what's happening.

1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:06.320
 What's unfolding in the world that we need to act upon.

1:47:06.320 --> 1:47:09.200
 And I think it's selfish and narcissistic

1:47:09.200 --> 1:47:13.400
 to push myself into these stories unnecessarily.

1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:16.240
 Now that said, I think there is some small value

1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:18.920
 in what you're saying, just to remind viewers

1:47:18.920 --> 1:47:21.040
 that there's obviously a filmmaker at play.

1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:23.040
 So sometimes the way that I do that

1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:25.720
 is just like through a question on camera.

1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:28.680
 I'd all allow the audio to live of a question

1:47:28.680 --> 1:47:31.200
 or during a conversation I'm having with someone

1:47:31.200 --> 1:47:34.840
 so they can just hear how it's posed, for example, right?

1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:36.200
 And to me, that's enough.

1:47:37.200 --> 1:47:38.040
 Yeah.

1:47:38.040 --> 1:47:43.040
 I do like moments when people recognize that you exist.

1:47:43.640 --> 1:47:47.240
 They look at the filmmaker past the camera.

1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:49.640
 And yeah, so you ask the question in the interview

1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:52.560
 or something like that, and they respond to that.

1:47:52.560 --> 1:47:53.680
 Yeah.

1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:57.200
 Like they respond to this like new perturbation

1:47:57.200 --> 1:48:00.480
 into their reality that was created by this other human.

1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:02.840
 And I especially like when those questions

1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:07.640
 or those perturbations are like a little bit absurd

1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:11.280
 and like add something very novel to their situation

1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:14.240
 and that novelties reveal something about them.

1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:18.280
 So as opposed to capturing the day to day reality

1:48:18.280 --> 1:48:21.640
 of their life, you do that plus the perturbations

1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:23.040
 of like something novel.

1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:26.880
 But of course, there's all kinds of ways to do this.

1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:29.680
 Let me, what was number five, by the way?

1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:31.000
 Only I only gave you four.

1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:32.320
 You just say it.

1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:33.480
 Stay at four.

1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:35.080
 There's a short doc I like, I mentioned,

1:48:35.080 --> 1:48:38.480
 they're called the toxic pigs of Fukushima.

1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:39.480
 I know, I know.

1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:40.320
 I apologize.

1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:41.160
 I know, I know.

1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:42.200
 It's dark.

1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:43.040
 It's dark.

1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:43.880
 It's a great title though, right?

1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:44.720
 It's a great title.

1:48:44.720 --> 1:48:47.200
 It's no one's seen it, but it's great.

1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:49.360
 It says what it sounds like.

1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:51.360
 Yeah, yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like,

1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:53.720
 but really brilliantly executed.

1:48:55.080 --> 1:48:56.400
 Well, let me ask you about Lifebook

1:48:56.400 --> 1:49:01.400
 because it's extremely, I don't,

1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:09.160
 it's a really moving idea, just the fact that this exists

1:49:09.480 --> 1:49:14.480
 in the world, that there's, as a metaphor, as a reality,

1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:18.720
 that there is a set of people trying to flee desperately.

1:49:18.720 --> 1:49:20.240
 It's the desperation of it.

1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:25.040
 And now there's refugees, the desperation of that,

1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:28.360
 of trying to escape towards a world

1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:31.720
 that's full of mystery, uncertainty,

1:49:31.720 --> 1:49:34.240
 doubt, could be hopeless at times.

1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:36.920
 And you're willing to do a lot

1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:39.760
 to free your own survival and the survival of your family

1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:40.760
 and all those kinds of things.

1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:42.840
 That's kind of the human spirit.

1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:47.480
 And you just capture it in Lifebook.

1:49:47.480 --> 1:49:51.040
 Can you tell me the story behind this film

1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:53.480
 as you started to already tell?

1:49:53.480 --> 1:49:55.520
 Can you tell me what is it about?

1:49:56.520 --> 1:50:01.520
 So Lifebook really seeks to sort of lift up

1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:08.520
 and showcase the asylum seeker crisis in the Mediterranean

1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:15.200
 when it was at its height in 2016.

1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:19.040
 And it came to be for many reasons,

1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:23.760
 but one of those reasons is colleagues

1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:26.600
 in the NGO community really shared with me

1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:29.800
 that when the borders between Greece and Turkey

1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:34.800
 were shut down, that the flow of Syrian asylum seekers

1:50:35.680 --> 1:50:39.720
 that was initially going across from Turkey to Greece

1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:42.600
 was going to shift westward across the Mediterranean.

1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:43.920
 So I started to research that

1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:46.720
 and discovered that was exactly the case.

1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:49.520
 And then further stumbled upon the fact

1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:54.440
 that nation states hadn't really stepped up to address it

1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:57.520
 and that there were hundreds of asylum seekers

1:50:57.520 --> 1:50:59.480
 often drowning in these flimsy crafts

1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:01.880
 that were pushed off from the shores of Libya

1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:06.160
 because the EU wasn't doing its duty

1:51:06.160 --> 1:51:09.640
 to patrol those waters from a humanitarian standpoint.

1:51:09.640 --> 1:51:13.280
 And so the net result of that was that this whole

1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:17.080
 sort of like humanitarian community sprung up.

1:51:17.080 --> 1:51:18.960
 And it was civil society based

1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:22.240
 that tried to meet the needs of those asylum seekers

1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:25.640
 to just ensure that fellow human beings

1:51:25.640 --> 1:51:27.520
 weren't drowning, simply put.

1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:31.120
 And one of those was this small little NGO called SeaWatch

1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:33.440
 which when they discovered what was happening

1:51:33.440 --> 1:51:38.440
 just cobbled together a coalition of volunteers,

1:51:38.880 --> 1:51:41.880
 bought a research vessel, retrofitted it

1:51:41.880 --> 1:51:44.520
 and motored down off the coast of Libya

1:51:44.520 --> 1:51:46.080
 to start pulling people out of the water.

1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:48.840
 And again, I found that inspiring, right?

1:51:48.840 --> 1:51:52.440
 I found that inspiring that this group of volunteers

1:51:52.440 --> 1:51:57.000
 was doing something that our leaders wouldn't, right?

1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:59.680
 And it was something as basic and simple

1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:01.640
 as saving human beings.

1:52:03.240 --> 1:52:06.360
 And I thought there was an inspiring story there.

1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:08.520
 And as it turned out, there was.

1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:11.320
 Have you ever saved someone's life?

1:52:13.640 --> 1:52:17.600
 As part of making these documentaries directly?

1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:22.120
 And directly, I think you probably have countless lives

1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:25.040
 but directly, were you put in that position?

1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:29.440
 I don't wanna, I mean, I certainly poured people

1:52:29.440 --> 1:52:33.560
 out of the water who couldn't swim, I did that.

1:52:33.560 --> 1:52:35.720
 And that's again, speaking to the basic humanity.

1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:38.840
 Put down the camera and help.

1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:40.560
 Yeah.

1:52:40.560 --> 1:52:43.520
 So this is people coming from Libya,

1:52:43.520 --> 1:52:46.240
 trying to make it across the Mediterranean Sea

1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:48.880
 on a crappy, tiny boat.

1:52:48.880 --> 1:52:51.400
 From a filmmaker perspective, how do you film that?

1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:55.880
 Was there decisions to capture the desperation?

1:52:55.880 --> 1:53:00.880
 Well, we were going back to this idea of access

1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:03.480
 and how that's so fundamental to my approach.

1:53:03.480 --> 1:53:08.200
 You know, we were bound by the strictures

1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:11.320
 of the rescue operation on this sea watch vessel,

1:53:11.320 --> 1:53:12.960
 which was 30 meters long.

1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:16.800
 And we were two of a crew of 15, right?

1:53:16.800 --> 1:53:18.760
 So we had to multitask all the time

1:53:18.760 --> 1:53:21.760
 because the only reason we were on that boat

1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:25.480
 was by agreeing that if needed,

1:53:25.480 --> 1:53:27.760
 we would do whatever necessary, right?

1:53:27.760 --> 1:53:30.760
 To help, right?

1:53:30.760 --> 1:53:33.200
 And so it was very active on multiple levels

1:53:33.200 --> 1:53:38.040
 and we were making decisions each and every day

1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:42.200
 that were not only filmmaking and creative decisions,

1:53:42.200 --> 1:53:47.200
 but also decisions about how to live that duality, right?

1:53:53.560 --> 1:53:57.000
 Of being a humanitarian and a filmmaker simultaneously.

1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:02.000
 And the greatest example I can share of that was,

1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:03.640
 well, with my director of photography

1:54:03.640 --> 1:54:05.400
 on that project, Kenny Allen,

1:54:07.480 --> 1:54:08.920
 Kenny's a big guy.

1:54:08.920 --> 1:54:12.320
 It's like, he's got like arms, like tree trunks and,

1:54:13.560 --> 1:54:18.280
 and he, because he was so physically able and strong,

1:54:18.280 --> 1:54:23.280
 the head of mission really tasked him to be on the Zodiacs

1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:24.840
 to pull people out of the water.

1:54:24.840 --> 1:54:27.080
 Cause he could literally with one arm reach down

1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:30.440
 and just oftentimes pull someone out, right?

1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:33.000
 Whereas usually it would take two or three people, right?

1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:37.040
 And so when we were at the height of triage

1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:39.400
 and there were people in the water all over

1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:41.800
 and rafts were sinking,

1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:43.760
 Kenny was out pulling people out of the water

1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:46.400
 and this went on for like 24 hours, right?

1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:48.360
 And at the end of that first day,

1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:51.240
 I remember like looking over on the deck

1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:54.360
 and seeing Kenny like help people up from the ladders

1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:56.240
 to walk them back, right?

1:54:56.240 --> 1:54:59.000
 And his camera was nowhere to be seen.

1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.280
 And so I walked over to him

1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:03.800
 and I just grabbed him by the shoulders and said,

1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:06.040
 Kenny, where's your camera?

1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:08.800
 And he didn't know.

1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:11.120
 He had no idea where his camera was, right?

1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:13.200
 And so I just said, Kenny,

1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:17.440
 we're here to do what you're doing,

1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:21.960
 but we're also here to film it, right?

1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:24.240
 To make sure that we document

1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:26.120
 what is unfolding in front of us

1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:28.160
 so that we have a record of it, right?

1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:30.760
 So we can bring it to a larger audience.

1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:32.440
 So you need to go find your camera

1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:34.880
 so we can also document it.

1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:36.480
 And that kind of pulled him out

1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:38.440
 and he went and got his camera and started filming again,

1:55:38.440 --> 1:55:40.960
 but that gives you a sense of sort of this world

1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:43.960
 that we had to live in in order to get the story done.

1:55:43.960 --> 1:55:47.320
 But I think to be a great director of photography,

1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:48.960
 to be a great director,

1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:53.880
 you have to lose yourself like that in the story too.

1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:55.920
 But usually with a camera in your hand, right?

1:55:55.920 --> 1:55:58.120
 But sometimes you forget the camera.

1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:02.720
 I mean, there's, I feel like

1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:06.240
 if you're obsessed with the camera too much,

1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:08.080
 you can lose the humanity of it.

1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:10.320
 You get obsessed with the film and the story.

1:56:10.320 --> 1:56:11.480
 It can become clinical.

1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:12.320
 Yes, it can become clinical.

1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:15.680
 Yeah, absolutely, and it's, you know, yeah, absolutely.

1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:17.040
 And we don't want to become,

1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:19.400
 I don't want to become clinical in my film, certainly.

1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:23.480
 Let me ask you a strange and perhaps edgy question.

1:56:23.480 --> 1:56:26.160
 So some filmmakers believe it's justified

1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:30.800
 to break the rules in order to tell a powerful story.

1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:35.800
 Warner Herzog, I read this somewhere,

1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:37.880
 teaches young filmmakers to pick locks

1:56:37.880 --> 1:56:39.560
 and forge documents and so on.

1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:41.400
 Oh, I didn't know that, interesting.

1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:42.520
 What do you think about that?

1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:45.080
 Bending the rules in service of telling a story.

1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:48.240
 You would of course never break the law,

1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:54.440
 but is there, does that just generally speaking

1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:58.440
 be speaking, bending the rules and so on?

1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:01.120
 You know, just to elaborate on this question,

1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:03.480
 perhaps I'm distinctly aware

1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:07.680
 that there's parts in the world where the rule of law

1:57:07.680 --> 1:57:12.680
 is not enforced as cleanly as it is in the United States,

1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:17.400
 as fairly as it is in the United States,

1:57:17.400 --> 1:57:20.920
 that there's a kind of, there's a lot of bribery,

1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:24.560
 there's a lot of, like you don't really know to trust,

1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:27.640
 you don't know if you can trust the cops

1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:30.360
 or basically anybody.

1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:34.640
 So like the rules are very hazy kind of concept.

1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:36.560
 And a lot of them, especially like it's funny,

1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:38.200
 but authoritarian regimes often have

1:57:38.200 --> 1:57:40.880
 a giant bureaucracy buildup that's full of rules.

1:57:40.880 --> 1:57:43.040
 There's more rules than you know what to deal with.

1:57:43.040 --> 1:57:46.000
 And you can't actually live life unless you break the rules.

1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:49.200
 Anyway, laying that all out on the table,

1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:51.640
 do you ever contend with that

1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:58.000
 on what are the rules I can break or should break

1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:00.840
 to keep to the spirit of the story?

1:58:00.840 --> 1:58:01.680
 I think you have to ask yourself,

1:58:01.680 --> 1:58:05.040
 are the rules just and why are they're in place, right?

1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:07.360
 So for example, coming into the airport

1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:09.160
 in Southern Yemen, right?

1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:11.880
 If I just tried to walk through the airport

1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:13.000
 with all my equipment,

1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:16.000
 even with all the permissions beforehand, like we had,

1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:19.800
 without having a fixer at the airport beforehand

1:58:19.800 --> 1:58:23.160
 to make sure we didn't go through the standard line, right?

1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:28.240
 We would have been caught up for three hours at least

1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:30.040
 negotiating over our equipment

1:58:30.040 --> 1:58:33.480
 and eventually paying a bribe to get it through, right?

1:58:33.480 --> 1:58:36.600
 That's just reality in a place like Yemen.

1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:39.680
 And so of course, knowing that, right?

1:58:39.680 --> 1:58:40.760
 Having talked to colleagues

1:58:40.760 --> 1:58:43.320
 who had taken that path previously,

1:58:43.320 --> 1:58:45.120
 I took a different path, right?

1:58:45.120 --> 1:58:47.360
 Well, we hire a fixer beforehand

1:58:47.360 --> 1:58:50.040
 to sort it out beforehand, right?

1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:52.240
 Rather than spending three hours of our time

1:58:52.240 --> 1:58:54.240
 and paying a series of bribes.

1:58:54.240 --> 1:58:56.960
 Instead, we're going to get it fixed beforehand

1:58:56.960 --> 1:58:59.160
 so that we can walk through a different line

1:58:59.160 --> 1:59:02.160
 and have no one look at any of our equipment.

1:59:02.160 --> 1:59:06.400
 That's a pretty good trade off in my mind.

1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:09.280
 What about security when you're traveling in these places?

1:59:09.280 --> 1:59:10.800
 Do you ever have bodyguards?

1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:14.600
 Well, several questions around that.

1:59:14.600 --> 1:59:16.800
 Are you ever afraid for your life?

1:59:16.800 --> 1:59:18.680
 When you're filming in a war zone,

1:59:19.600 --> 1:59:24.600
 is there any way to lessen the probability of death?

1:59:27.160 --> 1:59:28.400
 I don't have a death wish.

1:59:28.400 --> 1:59:32.000
 I try to mitigate risk however I can, however I can.

1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:35.120
 But one of the ways I can't do it in a conflict zone

1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:37.400
 is by having armed security with me.

1:59:37.400 --> 1:59:39.280
 And the reason for that is because,

1:59:39.280 --> 1:59:41.760
 especially in a place like Yemen, right?

1:59:41.760 --> 1:59:44.280
 If you have armed security, you become a target

1:59:44.280 --> 1:59:47.960
 in a way that if you're operating under sort of

1:59:47.960 --> 1:59:52.000
 the auspices of international humanitarian law,

1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:53.560
 I actually have more protection.

1:59:53.560 --> 1:59:55.440
 So I don't bring security.

1:59:55.440 --> 1:59:58.720
 If you're working in Northern Yemen, for example,

2:00:00.680 --> 2:00:03.720
 you're gonna have someone from the de facto authorities

2:00:03.720 --> 2:00:06.720
 with you anyway the entire time you're there.

2:00:06.720 --> 2:00:10.960
 So the authorities are with you in form anyway.

2:00:10.960 --> 2:00:15.960
 Regarding fear, yeah, of course.

2:00:18.520 --> 2:00:21.920
 I mean, fear is a natural human emotion, right?

2:00:21.920 --> 2:00:25.920
 And I think we have a weird mindset,

2:00:28.160 --> 2:00:31.160
 this sort of heroic mindset surrounding fear in the US

2:00:31.160 --> 2:00:34.280
 which I don't pay tribute to.

2:00:35.480 --> 2:00:38.960
 I believe as a natural human emotion,

2:00:38.960 --> 2:00:41.760
 it's an alarm bell that I need to pay attention to.

2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:46.760
 And I think rather than pretending to be brave,

2:00:48.320 --> 2:00:49.960
 I think you have to just acknowledge

2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:54.960
 that fear has a place to keep you alive.

2:00:55.440 --> 2:01:00.440
 And I think it's a matter of not letting the fear arrest you

2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:05.640
 and allowing the fear to live and then acting anyway.

2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:08.960
 So what you think as a documentary filmmaker, the fear

2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:12.880
 is a really good signal for potentially a good thing to do

2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:15.000
 because there's a story there.

2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.400
 So is fear as an indicator that you shouldn't do it

2:01:17.400 --> 2:01:19.320
 or is it an indicator that you should do it?

2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:23.080
 It's probably an indication you should do it, right?

2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:28.080
 And strangely that I think that's why I think that's,

2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:31.600
 if there's something unusual about the work I do

2:01:31.600 --> 2:01:35.240
 in some part, it's because of these types of stories, right?

2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:36.800
 They're hard to access,

2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:41.800
 but you also have to have a threshold of willingness

2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:45.520
 to do them when you can't,

2:01:46.920 --> 2:01:50.240
 there is no guarantee of physical safety, right?

2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:52.920
 And maybe that's why you should do them.

2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:56.280
 I'm very much motivated by the things that scare me.

2:01:56.280 --> 2:02:00.320
 They seem to direct the things that are worth doing

2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:02.000
 in this all too short life.

2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:05.120
 How often do you interact with our friendly friends

2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:07.680
 at the police departments of various locations?

2:02:08.560 --> 2:02:12.920
 Like, because of the humanitarian nature of your work,

2:02:12.920 --> 2:02:17.040
 are you able to avoid all such friendly conversations

2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:21.640
 or are you often in making friends with our?

2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:25.240
 I try to avoid the friendly police people

2:02:25.240 --> 2:02:27.040
 all over the world as much as possible,

2:02:28.240 --> 2:02:33.240
 but in some instances it's important to be proactive, right?

2:02:33.240 --> 2:02:36.360
 And make sure that they know what you're doing

2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:37.560
 before you do it.

2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:40.680
 So it's all about the context and the situation.

2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:43.600
 For example, working in Northern Yemen,

2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:46.320
 you couldn't film for five minutes if you didn't have

2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:48.680
 paperwork, because you'd be taken away.

2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:50.720
 So you have to make sure you have all those permissions

2:02:50.720 --> 2:02:51.560
 ahead of time.

2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:58.720
 50 feet from Syria, I would love to talk

2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:00.520
 at least a little bit about this film.

2:03:00.520 --> 2:03:03.560
 First, can you, high level,

2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:05.480
 can you tell what this documentary is about?

2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:09.440
 Yeah, it was early in the Syrian uprising,

2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:14.440
 and we returned to the Syrian Turkish border

2:03:15.800 --> 2:03:18.880
 with a Syrian American orthopedic surgeon

2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:21.560
 who was volunteering, operating on refugees

2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:24.560
 as they flowed across the border from Syrian to Turkey.

2:03:25.480 --> 2:03:27.720
 And it was an attempt at the time

2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:30.680
 before a lot of films had come out about the conflict

2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:35.680
 to really show again the effects of the war on civilians.

2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:41.920
 You've heard me echo that sentiment multiple times now,

2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:46.920
 but people knew there was a major conflict in Syria,

2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:50.160
 but didn't really understand the form that that was taking

2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:51.800
 and the impact it was having.

2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:55.520
 And so we embedded into the,

2:03:55.520 --> 2:03:58.800
 at the time it was the only clinic in Turkey

2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:02.160
 that was sanctioned by the Turkish government

2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:05.040
 to treat Syrian refugees.

2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:08.320
 And so we filmed there with surgeons

2:04:08.320 --> 2:04:11.160
 as they operated on more victims.

2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:14.160
 And we also went into Syria into some of the camps as well.

2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:17.920
 So in this film, there's a man who crosses the border

2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:19.640
 every day to retrieve the wounded

2:04:19.640 --> 2:04:21.680
 and fare them safety and care.

2:04:21.680 --> 2:04:25.440
 And you also mentioned about heroism in the United States.

2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:29.960
 Can you tell me about this man and just people like him?

2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:31.760
 Like, what's the heroic action

2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:35.840
 in some of these places that you've visited?

2:04:35.840 --> 2:04:37.560
 So in that instance, you know,

2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:41.120
 I thought of him as the Turkish Schindler, right?

2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:45.600
 Because he was human being who, of his own volition,

2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:48.840
 volition, no one was paying him to do this,

2:04:48.840 --> 2:04:53.600
 but he was spending much of his time.

2:04:53.600 --> 2:04:55.480
 He was just a local businessman

2:04:55.480 --> 2:04:57.800
 who really saw the need in the camps

2:04:57.800 --> 2:05:00.320
 right across the border, 10K away.

2:05:00.320 --> 2:05:04.200
 And he saw the medical need in particular

2:05:04.200 --> 2:05:07.400
 and how hard it was to get people

2:05:07.400 --> 2:05:11.200
 in desperate medical conditions across the border

2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:13.720
 where there was a clinic just right across the border.

2:05:13.720 --> 2:05:17.960
 But because of the security and the layers of security,

2:05:17.960 --> 2:05:20.040
 they couldn't get out by themselves.

2:05:20.040 --> 2:05:24.040
 So he took it upon himself as a Turkish person

2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:26.960
 to build relationships with the Turkish guards,

2:05:26.960 --> 2:05:28.960
 which was relatively easy.

2:05:28.960 --> 2:05:31.360
 And then he built relationships

2:05:31.360 --> 2:05:34.480
 with sort of the guards in the no man's land

2:05:34.480 --> 2:05:36.200
 between the Syrian guards

2:05:36.200 --> 2:05:38.480
 and sort of those who lived in the middle area.

2:05:38.480 --> 2:05:41.200
 And then also with the Syrian guards at the camp.

2:05:41.200 --> 2:05:46.000
 And he would drive out there daily and bring them food, right?

2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:47.640
 Talk them up and build relationships.

2:05:47.640 --> 2:05:49.960
 And every day he would bring these guards food

2:05:49.960 --> 2:05:51.560
 and build relationships with them.

2:05:51.560 --> 2:05:54.400
 And what that meant was eventually, right,

2:05:54.400 --> 2:05:58.760
 he had this avenue of access to and from the camps.

2:05:58.760 --> 2:06:00.440
 And so he started using it.

2:06:00.440 --> 2:06:05.160
 And he would drive this avenue of access

2:06:05.160 --> 2:06:08.080
 through the three layers of guards each day.

2:06:08.080 --> 2:06:10.480
 And then they would open the gates for him

2:06:10.480 --> 2:06:14.000
 because he had made himself trustworthy in their eyes.

2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:18.480
 And he would receive the most desperate medical cases

2:06:18.480 --> 2:06:21.920
 that were coming from all over northern Syria, right?

2:06:21.920 --> 2:06:23.560
 To receive medical treatment.

2:06:23.560 --> 2:06:25.440
 And he would, as you see in the film,

2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:29.120
 he would ferry them into the back of his car, right?

2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:31.720
 And then drive them to the hospital

2:06:31.720 --> 2:06:33.600
 where they would receive operations.

2:06:33.600 --> 2:06:36.640
 And then he would bring them back if they wanted

2:06:36.640 --> 2:06:39.520
 after they'd healed and recovered back to Syria

2:06:39.520 --> 2:06:41.960
 if they wanted to return out post recovery.

2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:44.120
 And he didn't get paid for that.

2:06:44.120 --> 2:06:46.640
 He was spending his own money to do it

2:06:46.640 --> 2:06:49.600
 because he saw other human beings in need.

2:06:49.600 --> 2:06:52.840
 And it's like we were talking about earlier.

2:06:52.840 --> 2:06:54.640
 That's heroic, right?

2:06:54.640 --> 2:06:56.000
 That's selfless.

2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:59.920
 That's aspirational for me, right?

2:06:59.920 --> 2:07:04.000
 Here's someone who is spending their time on the planet

2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.720
 doing something of value and good to other human beings.

2:07:07.720 --> 2:07:09.440
 I mean, if you draw a parallel to Schindler,

2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:13.640
 I feel like the fascinating thing about Schindler

2:07:13.640 --> 2:07:18.240
 is that he's kind of a flawed human

2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:19.480
 and he's not the kind of human

2:07:19.480 --> 2:07:21.640
 that does these things usually,

2:07:21.640 --> 2:07:23.480
 but he just can't help it.

2:07:23.480 --> 2:07:25.040
 And that's like the basic humanity,

2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:28.120
 despite who you are,

2:07:28.120 --> 2:07:30.320
 the basic humanity shines through.

2:07:30.320 --> 2:07:35.240
 I think the whims of war test people in those ways, right?

2:07:35.240 --> 2:07:36.640
 They ask of you,

2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:39.600
 things that you may not even know

2:07:39.600 --> 2:07:41.200
 were going to be asked of you.

2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:43.160
 And then it speaks to who you are

2:07:43.160 --> 2:07:44.960
 fundamentally as a human being.

2:07:44.960 --> 2:07:47.840
 They reveal who you are as a human being,

2:07:47.840 --> 2:07:48.840
 just as you said.

2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:55.160
 Let me ask a kind of stupid technical question

2:07:55.160 --> 2:07:58.160
 about publications and movies and so on.

2:07:58.160 --> 2:08:02.320
 I've been recently becoming good friends with Thomas Tull,

2:08:02.320 --> 2:08:04.200
 who was the producer.

2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:06.320
 His company Legendary funded some of the big

2:08:06.320 --> 2:08:08.520
 sort of blockbuster films and so on.

2:08:08.520 --> 2:08:10.880
 And so obviously money is part of filmmaking.

2:08:10.880 --> 2:08:13.720
 It's interesting, but also the release of movies.

2:08:13.720 --> 2:08:18.880
 And me as a consumer, with Netflix, with YouTube,

2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:23.720
 that's one of the reasons I'm a huge fan of YouTube

2:08:23.720 --> 2:08:26.880
 is it's like out in the open.

2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:30.400
 Access, especially historical access.

2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:33.960
 Like over time, you can look back years later.

2:08:33.960 --> 2:08:35.160
 If you pay some money,

2:08:35.160 --> 2:08:38.360
 you can watch some of the great films ever made.

2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:40.320
 YouTube, Hulu, Netflix,

2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:41.920
 I don't know what other services there are.

2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:44.120
 HBO, Paramount.

2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:46.040
 Paramount Plus. Paramount Plus.

2:08:48.280 --> 2:08:50.160
 Anyway, there's all these platforms.

2:08:51.280 --> 2:08:52.760
 Spotify now.

2:08:54.600 --> 2:08:59.040
 It's, I understand they want to create paywalls and so on.

2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:02.560
 It makes sense, but I'm a huge fan of openness

2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:04.680
 and I'm really kind of torn by this whole thing.

2:09:04.680 --> 2:09:07.360
 Anyway, that's a discussion for perhaps another time.

2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:10.000
 But the short question is,

2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:14.040
 why is it so hard to watch your documentaries

2:09:14.040 --> 2:09:18.960
 and other films, other incredible films on the internet?

2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:23.120
 If I want to pay unlimited amount of money,

2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:26.440
 I want to pay a lot of money to watch it.

2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:27.960
 Why is it so hard?

2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:30.840
 Well, Lifeboat is streaming free on the New Yorker.

2:09:30.840 --> 2:09:35.440
 Yes, I saw that, but it's still, which is interesting.

2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:37.360
 That doesn't make any sense.

2:09:37.360 --> 2:09:41.680
 And then also, Hunger Ward is on Paramount Plus,

2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:43.120
 but also, Pluto TV.

2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:45.680
 It's also streaming free.

2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:48.000
 So you can either go through a paywall

2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:50.120
 or you can watch it with ads,

2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:52.240
 with Big Macs interspersed.

2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:53.920
 Big Macs. Sometimes.

2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:57.040
 Yeah, the contrast is tough.

2:09:57.040 --> 2:10:01.320
 Well, it really reveals the power of the documentary.

2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:04.440
 No, but like, it's still not, even those platforms are,

2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:07.800
 I mean, they're not as easily accessible.

2:10:07.800 --> 2:10:09.640
 Because you have to like, you have to use,

2:10:09.640 --> 2:10:13.320
 you have to think and you have to chase a particular movie.

2:10:13.320 --> 2:10:15.240
 You have to chase it, yeah, yeah.

2:10:15.240 --> 2:10:17.080
 I guess from an economics standpoint,

2:10:17.080 --> 2:10:19.440
 the answer to that is pretty clear, right?

2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:21.680
 It may not be what people want to watch.

2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:25.560
 Maybe people want to watch reality.

2:10:25.560 --> 2:10:30.560
 Maybe people want to watch animal rescue shows,

2:10:30.800 --> 2:10:32.280
 right, here in the US.

2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:36.240
 Which is exactly why in part,

2:10:36.240 --> 2:10:40.640
 I think it's so vital that we continue to do stories

2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:44.280
 on things that aren't about flowers and puppy dogs, right?

2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:45.280
 I would push back on that.

2:10:45.280 --> 2:10:49.240
 So, there's TikTok.

2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:51.960
 And you could say, well, look,

2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:55.880
 humans just want to watch really short content

2:10:55.880 --> 2:10:58.280
 because they seem to be addicted to that kind of thing.

2:10:58.280 --> 2:11:00.080
 That's partially true.

2:11:00.080 --> 2:11:04.200
 But they also watch two, three, four, five hour podcasts.

2:11:05.240 --> 2:11:06.200
 And...

2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:07.360
 On TikTok?

2:11:07.360 --> 2:11:09.400
 No, there's different platforms for that.

2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:11.040
 This is a place called YouTube.

2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:12.080
 I'll teach you about it some day.

2:11:12.080 --> 2:11:14.320
 Okay, yeah, I've never heard of it.

2:11:14.320 --> 2:11:16.960
 It's a good place to publish documentaries, I think.

2:11:18.880 --> 2:11:21.880
 Humans are interested in a lot of things.

2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:24.960
 And I've seen many times,

2:11:24.960 --> 2:11:26.880
 a thing that you think is a niche thing

2:11:26.880 --> 2:11:29.080
 become a very big thing.

2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:31.000
 But for them to become mainstream,

2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:32.320
 they have to have a platform

2:11:32.320 --> 2:11:35.120
 that allows for the mainstream to happen.

2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:35.960
 The access.

2:11:35.960 --> 2:11:39.960
 The access, the dumb, simple, frictionless access.

2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:43.600
 The frictionless access is a really important thing.

2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:46.880
 Paywalls create friction.

2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:50.480
 And not just because of the money, it can be free.

2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:52.120
 But if you have to click on a thing,

2:11:52.120 --> 2:11:55.680
 or maybe sign up, or put your email,

2:11:56.960 --> 2:11:58.600
 it's just not...

2:11:58.600 --> 2:11:59.440
 It creates...

2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:05.040
 It prevents you to enjoy the thing you would really enjoy

2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:06.680
 and you know you would enjoy.

2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:10.800
 But your baser human nature prevents you from enjoying

2:12:10.800 --> 2:12:14.240
 because you can just open up TikTok and keep scrolling.

2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:17.000
 So that's just something to say about platforms

2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:20.200
 because I think the things that need platforms

2:12:20.200 --> 2:12:23.960
 the most are things like your films.

2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:27.280
 The things that I think a lot of people would love watching.

2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:30.480
 They're very important and they can have viral impact

2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:32.840
 on the world that is fundamentally positive.

2:12:32.840 --> 2:12:35.440
 You know, it's just, it makes me sad

2:12:35.440 --> 2:12:40.440
 that there's not a machine for celebrating those films.

2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:44.160
 There are lots of machines to celebrate them,

2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:47.520
 but they're just not as always accessible as YouTube, right?

2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:49.080
 I mean, as soon as you write me that check

2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:51.360
 for a trillion dollars when I walk out of here,

2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:53.360
 then I'm gonna put all my films on YouTube

2:12:53.360 --> 2:12:56.360
 because then I won't have to worry about selling them

2:12:56.360 --> 2:12:58.040
 in order so I can make the next film

2:12:58.040 --> 2:13:00.920
 because film is not just an art.

2:13:00.920 --> 2:13:02.920
 It's also an industry, right?

2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:06.560
 And that tension between the two is a constant interplay

2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:08.760
 that is a reality for me.

2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:10.520
 So I always have to think about

2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.840
 how can I access the largest audience,

2:13:14.840 --> 2:13:19.320
 but also, right, go out and shoot the next film, right?

2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:22.360
 So that longevity question is also an issue

2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:26.840
 and the finances are part of that sort of equation

2:13:26.840 --> 2:13:29.560
 that I constantly have to rewrite over and over again.

2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:32.320
 How often, as a creative mind,

2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:35.600
 do you feel the constraints, the financial constraints?

2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:41.160
 I wish I could do a lot more films

2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:44.840
 that I can't always because of financial constraints.

2:13:44.840 --> 2:13:46.240
 So it's the number of films.

2:13:46.240 --> 2:13:47.080
 Yeah.

2:13:48.120 --> 2:13:51.560
 And is a film that you do currently,

2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:53.960
 is a film that you do at any one time

2:13:53.960 --> 2:13:56.480
 as you're filming it already funded

2:13:56.480 --> 2:13:59.080
 or is it the funding from previous stuff

2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:01.160
 that you're trying to use?

2:14:01.160 --> 2:14:02.820
 Before Hunger Ward,

2:14:05.120 --> 2:14:08.240
 I would just take a flyer on my films, right?

2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:12.960
 Where I would just say, this meets the so what threshold.

2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:15.040
 This is a story that has to be told

2:14:15.040 --> 2:14:17.560
 and I want to tell it.

2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:19.640
 And then I could just go shoot it.

2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:22.840
 And usually on credit, usually on a credit card, right?

2:14:22.840 --> 2:14:27.480
 So based on a belief that lifeboat was done that way.

2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:28.320
 Yes.

2:14:28.320 --> 2:14:29.160
 Right?

2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:30.000
 50 feet from Syria was done that way.

2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.240
 So you're on a boat, broke.

2:14:32.240 --> 2:14:34.920
 Yeah, yeah, but it's free food, right?

2:14:34.920 --> 2:14:37.200
 And free lodging because there's a bunk on the boat.

2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:41.600
 But I do that, not intending to stay broke, right?

2:14:41.600 --> 2:14:44.120
 But based on a foundational belief

2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:49.120
 that if I bring to bear all of my sort of quiver

2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:53.040
 of creative arrows to it, right?

2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:56.680
 That I can create something of value, right?

2:14:56.680 --> 2:15:00.260
 In the world, but hopefully also financially

2:15:00.260 --> 2:15:02.000
 that then I can sell to someone.

2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:05.040
 And you know, every time I've done that, Lex,

2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:07.000
 I've gotten into the black.

2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:08.640
 So it's a risk.

2:15:08.640 --> 2:15:11.160
 And I have to have a certain risk threshold

2:15:11.160 --> 2:15:12.440
 financially to do that.

2:15:12.440 --> 2:15:14.440
 But I believe so deeply in these stories

2:15:14.440 --> 2:15:15.680
 that I'm willing to do that.

2:15:15.680 --> 2:15:17.080
 I didn't have to do that with Hungarward.

2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:20.080
 Luckily I had funders for that film.

2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:22.520
 Yeah.

2:15:22.520 --> 2:15:24.480
 Yeah, take risks in this life.

2:15:24.480 --> 2:15:25.720
 It's gonna pay off.

2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:28.400
 Which reminds me of, let me ask you,

2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:31.120
 I already asked you for advice about,

2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:34.320
 for a filmmaker, how to win an Oscar.

2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:35.800
 Well, I haven't won an Oscar.

2:15:35.800 --> 2:15:37.240
 How to get nominated for an Oscar.

2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:38.080
 That's true.

2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:42.120
 Or just how to make great documentaries,

2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:42.960
 how to make great film.

2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:44.960
 But let me ask, even zoom out bigger.

2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:48.240
 You mentioned some of these things,

2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:50.440
 doing the things that you think matters.

2:15:50.440 --> 2:15:52.960
 What advice would you give to young people,

2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:57.960
 high school, college, dreaming of living a life worth living?

2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:03.840
 What advice would you give them about career

2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:06.040
 or maybe just life in general?

2:16:06.040 --> 2:16:08.040
 How do I have a life they can be proud of?

2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:11.240
 Yeah, I don't know how you're gonna react to this,

2:16:11.240 --> 2:16:13.040
 given sort of your expertise.

2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:17.320
 But I would say, put down the smartphone.

2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:19.480
 Step away from the monitor, right?

2:16:19.480 --> 2:16:23.680
 Because real life is not a screen, right?

2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:27.080
 I believe that sort of the foundational skills

2:16:27.080 --> 2:16:30.400
 which are conducive and important to success

2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:34.800
 aren't necessarily those technical skills

2:16:34.800 --> 2:16:39.440
 which we're going to learn in trade schools or university.

2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:43.280
 I think they're more foundational than that.

2:16:43.280 --> 2:16:48.160
 They're learning how to interact and listen.

2:16:48.160 --> 2:16:49.000
 With humans?

2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:54.000
 With humans, yeah, to really see and listen, right?

2:16:54.880 --> 2:16:55.720
 And observe.

2:16:55.720 --> 2:17:00.600
 And observe, right? And how to step out of your door

2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:03.040
 and if the electricity goes out, right?

2:17:03.040 --> 2:17:05.040
 And you're five miles away from your house,

2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:07.360
 you don't need a smartphone to get home

2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:10.240
 because you've set visual markers for yourself

2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:12.520
 on how to get back to where you live, right?

2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:15.040
 I think we're in danger right now

2:17:16.040 --> 2:17:19.640
 of living in a world where if the satellites

2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:21.480
 stop functioning, right?

2:17:21.480 --> 2:17:26.480
 Then a whole lot of people have become completely dysfunctional,

2:17:27.560 --> 2:17:28.400
 right?

2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:30.920
 Because we're so reliant upon the screens in our lives.

2:17:30.920 --> 2:17:33.240
 So I think there's a lot of foundational skills

2:17:33.240 --> 2:17:34.840
 that have nothing to do with technology

2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:38.040
 that we need to learn and everything rests upon those.

2:17:38.040 --> 2:17:39.200
 So I would say learn those foundations,

2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:43.360
 learn how to write well, read a lot, right?

2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:45.680
 There's a different kind of knowledge and wisdom

2:17:45.680 --> 2:17:47.440
 that comes out of that.

2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:49.600
 So reading is kind of the equivalent of listening,

2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:54.600
 observing and writing is kind of integration

2:17:56.280 --> 2:17:58.520
 of all of that that you've observed and listened to

2:17:58.520 --> 2:18:00.320
 and tried to express something with that.

2:18:00.320 --> 2:18:02.640
 So I think my training in the theater

2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:06.760
 has served me so well in the documentary world, right?

2:18:06.760 --> 2:18:09.000
 Because it's all about interaction

2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:11.960
 and listening and talking and dialogue, right?

2:18:11.960 --> 2:18:14.240
 And that's what I do in documentaries, right?

2:18:14.240 --> 2:18:15.880
 Is I listen.

2:18:15.880 --> 2:18:20.880
 Yeah, we mentioned fear, being an introvert,

2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:24.640
 I'm very afraid of people, but I'm drawn to them.

2:18:24.640 --> 2:18:26.960
 I've been fascinated by them because of that.

2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:28.280
 Enjoy listening to them.

2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:29.120
 Totally.

2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:33.120
 And observing them, and you mentioned reading,

2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:35.400
 you mentioned books as a catalyst,

2:18:35.400 --> 2:18:37.960
 as a stimulator of your imagination.

2:18:37.960 --> 2:18:42.400
 Is there books in your life, a couple, one, two, three,

2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:46.240
 that kind of left an impact

2:18:46.240 --> 2:18:51.240
 or a little bit of a spark of inspiration early on in life

2:18:52.560 --> 2:18:54.400
 that stand out from your memory?

2:18:54.400 --> 2:18:57.960
 I was given The Prophet by Khalil Debron

2:18:57.960 --> 2:18:59.600
 when I, as a graduation president

2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:03.040
 from my eight, from my high school English teacher.

2:19:03.040 --> 2:19:05.880
 And I still have that book in a special place

2:19:05.880 --> 2:19:08.600
 on my bookshelf, because I think it speaks

2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:11.800
 to the nature of human experience, right?

2:19:11.800 --> 2:19:13.840
 And I return to it all the time,

2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:15.760
 because there's wisdom there, you know?

2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:18.240
 But there's many, many books.

2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:21.760
 Fiction and nonfiction, what connects with you usually?

2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:23.080
 In the past, when the, for the past?

2:19:23.080 --> 2:19:26.480
 No, I read mostly nonfiction, most of the time.

2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:28.920
 Ten Points is a book I love a lot.

2:19:28.920 --> 2:19:30.560
 What is it, what is Ten Points?

2:19:30.560 --> 2:19:34.120
 Ten Points is, I think his name is Bill Strickland.

2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:37.840
 He was the editor of I think Bicycle Magazine.

2:19:37.840 --> 2:19:42.560
 And it's sort of his personal memoir of his experience

2:19:42.560 --> 2:19:44.080
 growing up with a lot of abuse

2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:46.680
 and how that transformed him as a human being.

2:19:46.680 --> 2:19:49.240
 You know, one instrumental book for me

2:19:49.240 --> 2:19:51.960
 that I bumped into in my early 20s.

2:19:51.960 --> 2:19:54.160
 Boy, these are all nonfiction.

2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:55.760
 Except for The Princess Bride.

2:19:55.760 --> 2:19:59.160
 I have to mention, it's an outlier.

2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:02.400
 No, no, the seven habits of highly effective people.

2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:03.240
 Yes.

2:20:03.240 --> 2:20:05.400
 I read that in my early 20s.

2:20:05.400 --> 2:20:10.400
 And I found so many of the principles in that book.

2:20:11.280 --> 2:20:13.280
 What are the habits from that one?

2:20:14.480 --> 2:20:16.840
 Seek first to understand and to be understood

2:20:16.840 --> 2:20:18.760
 is one of them, you know.

2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:21.800
 The notion of proactivity is one of them.

2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:25.080
 It's really, and so I've held onto some of those principles

2:20:25.080 --> 2:20:27.920
 through my life as well, for sure.

2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:32.920
 What have been, you've observed suffering, darker aspects

2:20:36.240 --> 2:20:38.880
 of human nature in your own personal life.

2:20:38.880 --> 2:20:42.960
 What has been some of the darkest moments in your life,

2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:45.160
 darkest times in your life?

2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:49.400
 Is there something that you went through

2:20:49.400 --> 2:20:53.000
 and then perhaps you carry it through your work?

2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:54.620
 Yeah.

2:20:54.620 --> 2:20:56.520
 Probably one of the darkest moments

2:20:56.520 --> 2:21:00.840
 was an experience that I had again in my early 20s.

2:21:00.840 --> 2:21:03.300
 And I was living in Southern California.

2:21:04.240 --> 2:21:08.760
 And I, you know, the Pacific Coast Highway

2:21:08.760 --> 2:21:10.600
 that goes north and south along the beach.

2:21:10.600 --> 2:21:14.000
 And there's that little concrete path

2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:15.440
 that people jog and ride their bikes.

2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:18.080
 And I was riding my bike on the PCH.

2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:21.960
 And I was coming up to a corner on it

2:21:21.960 --> 2:21:26.960
 and I heard this tremendous crash and it was really loud.

2:21:28.920 --> 2:21:31.560
 And I came across the, around the corner

2:21:31.560 --> 2:21:34.720
 and it was a car accident, a car crash.

2:21:34.720 --> 2:21:38.040
 It was a multiple, multiple vehicle crash.

2:21:38.040 --> 2:21:43.040
 And what had happened is that a Volvo had hit another car

2:21:44.480 --> 2:21:48.080
 and then when it hit it, it went over the top of the car

2:21:48.080 --> 2:21:51.400
 and hit a Volkswagen van and it peeled away

2:21:51.400 --> 2:21:53.440
 the top of the Volkswagen van when it hit it

2:21:53.440 --> 2:21:55.120
 and then landed.

2:21:55.120 --> 2:21:59.560
 So three vehicles and it just happened.

2:21:59.560 --> 2:22:04.200
 And lying in the middle of the road

2:22:04.200 --> 2:22:07.440
 was a body decapitated.

2:22:08.600 --> 2:22:12.520
 And there was another person from one of the cars

2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:15.400
 lying in the middle of the road, still alive.

2:22:15.400 --> 2:22:17.960
 And then on the hood of the Volvo

2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:22.360
 was this woman who had come through the windshield,

2:22:22.360 --> 2:22:27.360
 just a mess, blood everywhere, moaning back and forth.

2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:33.920
 And a bystander ran into the middle of the road

2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:35.960
 and started administering first aid

2:22:35.960 --> 2:22:38.280
 to the person lying in the road.

2:22:38.280 --> 2:22:43.280
 And I stood there watching the scene

2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:48.280
 and every fiber of my being wanted to run to the woman

2:22:51.120 --> 2:22:55.960
 on the hood of the Volvo and do something, anything, right?

2:22:55.960 --> 2:22:56.920
 Just to be there.

2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:00.560
 And it was obvious to me that she was gonna die.

2:23:01.640 --> 2:23:04.000
 But I felt like at least if I ran there,

2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:08.160
 I could offer some comfort for her last moment.

2:23:08.160 --> 2:23:12.080
 And right then, the siren started to blare

2:23:12.080 --> 2:23:15.840
 and I knew that there'd be paramedics there

2:23:15.840 --> 2:23:18.960
 within minutes that people would come to help.

2:23:20.160 --> 2:23:25.160
 And I froze and I was scared and I didn't do anything.

2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:32.040
 And I watched while this woman died on the hood of the Volvo.

2:23:32.040 --> 2:23:37.040
 And that experience is sort of seared into my consciousness.

2:23:38.480 --> 2:23:42.080
 The fact that I watched and didn't act,

2:23:42.080 --> 2:23:46.320
 I feel as one of the great failures of my life

2:23:46.320 --> 2:23:49.240
 that I wasn't able to act in a moment of need,

2:23:49.240 --> 2:23:50.720
 no matter how small.

2:23:51.720 --> 2:23:56.720
 And from that, I made a decision out of that experience

2:23:56.720 --> 2:24:00.720
 that if I ever found myself in a situation where I had the ability

2:24:00.720 --> 2:24:04.720
 to act and I could act to help another human being

2:24:04.720 --> 2:24:07.720
 in such need that I would act,

2:24:07.720 --> 2:24:11.720
 that I wouldn't let fear freeze me.

2:24:11.720 --> 2:24:15.720
 Instead, I would allow that fear to catalyze me

2:24:15.720 --> 2:24:18.720
 into action and do something and intervene

2:24:18.720 --> 2:24:20.720
 in whatever way I could,

2:24:20.720 --> 2:24:23.720
 even if I didn't have the skillset.

2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:28.720
 And in some ways, all of that echoes in your documentaries.

2:24:29.720 --> 2:24:33.720
 You're not gonna let fear stop you from trying to help.

2:24:33.720 --> 2:24:36.720
 I think that experience, that experience of failure,

2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:41.720
 what I framed as just human failure on my part

2:24:42.720 --> 2:24:45.720
 is foundational, probably, to my work.

2:24:45.720 --> 2:24:47.720
 Like, I don't want that to happen again, legs.

2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:49.720
 Like, I don't want to be that person

2:24:49.720 --> 2:24:53.720
 who watches, I want to do what I can when I can.

2:24:54.720 --> 2:24:55.720
 If we zoom out,

2:24:57.720 --> 2:25:01.720
 you were just one human that witnessed that, that trauma.

2:25:01.720 --> 2:25:05.720
 You, one human that witnessed so much suffering

2:25:05.720 --> 2:25:07.720
 in different parts of the world.

2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:11.720
 And as we zoom out across space and time and look at Earth,

2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:14.720
 why do you think we're here?

2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:19.720
 Why do you think we're here on this Earth?

2:25:20.720 --> 2:25:23.720
 What's the meaning of human civilization?

2:25:23.720 --> 2:25:28.720
 What's the meaning of your life, of individual human life?

2:25:29.720 --> 2:25:33.720
 And broadly speaking, what is the meaning of life?

2:25:33.720 --> 2:25:34.720
 This guy, this child.

2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:36.720
 No, boy, yeah.

2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:40.720
 Yeah.

2:25:41.720 --> 2:25:44.720
 For me, I can speak personally on that only.

2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:48.720
 And that's that I believe that the meaning of my life

2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:52.720
 is to try to make the world a little bit better before I go.

2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:00.720
 When I was in theater in grad school,

2:26:00.720 --> 2:26:06.720
 I directed a play called Shadowlands by C.S. Lewis.

2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:08.720
 And there's a quote from that.

2:26:08.720 --> 2:26:09.720
 It goes like this.

2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:12.720
 We are like blocks of stone out of which the sculptor

2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:15.720
 carves the forms of men.

2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:19.720
 The blows of his chisel, which hurt us so much,

2:26:19.720 --> 2:26:21.720
 are what make us perfect.

2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:25.720
 Now, I would take away the perfect part, right?

2:26:25.720 --> 2:26:29.720
 But I think I've remembered that quote for so many years

2:26:29.720 --> 2:26:33.720
 because I believe in the underlying notion

2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:36.720
 that the blows of the chisel,

2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:38.720
 which are the experiences that we go through,

2:26:38.720 --> 2:26:40.720
 shape us, right?

2:26:40.720 --> 2:26:41.720
 Necessarily so.

2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:45.720
 And hopefully shape us into a better human being.

2:26:45.720 --> 2:26:48.720
 And in my case, a human being that I hope

2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:51.720
 can make the world a little better, you know,

2:26:51.720 --> 2:26:53.720
 through those blows.

2:26:53.720 --> 2:26:54.720
 Before it's over.

2:26:54.720 --> 2:26:56.720
 Yeah, before it's over.

2:26:56.720 --> 2:26:59.720
 Before you go, as you said, do you think about that?

2:26:59.720 --> 2:27:02.720
 You think about the going part?

2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:04.720
 Your mortality?

2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:05.720
 You ever think about that?

2:27:05.720 --> 2:27:07.720
 You said you don't have a death wish.

2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:08.720
 You tried to minimize risk.

2:27:08.720 --> 2:27:10.720
 But eventually it's going to be over.

2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:11.720
 Yeah, for all of us.

2:27:11.720 --> 2:27:12.720
 Absolutely.

2:27:12.720 --> 2:27:14.720
 Well, speak for yourself.

2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:16.720
 Well, you've got other plans or something.

2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:17.720
 I tend to merge.

2:27:17.720 --> 2:27:20.720
 I'm going to merge with robots.

2:27:20.720 --> 2:27:21.720
 Embodied.

2:27:21.720 --> 2:27:22.720
 Not at all.

2:27:22.720 --> 2:27:24.720
 Yes, for all of us.

2:27:24.720 --> 2:27:28.720
 Unfortunately, you're fortunately or who the heck knows.

2:27:28.720 --> 2:27:32.720
 But do you ponder your mortality?

2:27:32.720 --> 2:27:34.720
 Are you afraid of it?

2:27:34.720 --> 2:27:39.720
 I live with my mortality knowing that it's fleeting,

2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:43.720
 that my life is fleeting and that I'm going to go into the ground

2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:47.720
 just like everyone else or maybe as ashes, you know.

2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:49.720
 So I live with that knowledge every day,

2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:53.720
 but I don't allow it to stop me or hold me up

2:27:53.720 --> 2:27:56.720
 rather I really, it drives me.

2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:01.720
 It drives me to try to get as much done as I can before I go.

2:28:01.720 --> 2:28:02.720
 Right?

2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:06.720
 Yeah, so the knowledge of your death is a kind of dance partner.

2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:09.720
 And you try to dance beautifully.

2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:12.720
 Scott, you're an incredible human.

2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:15.720
 Incredible artist and filmmaker.

2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:17.720
 And it's a huge honor that you would sit

2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:20.720
 and spend your really valuable time with me today.

2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:22.720
 I really, really enjoy this conversation.

2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:23.720
 Thank you.

2:28:23.720 --> 2:28:24.720
 Thanks for having me, Lex.

2:28:24.720 --> 2:28:25.720
 And thanks for doing what you do.

2:28:25.720 --> 2:28:28.720
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Skye Fitzgerald.

2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:36.720
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Elie Wiesel.

2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:39.720
 The opposite of love is not hate.

2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:41.720
 It's indifference.

2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:43.720
 The opposite of art is not ugliness.

2:28:43.720 --> 2:28:45.720
 It's indifference.

2:28:45.720 --> 2:28:47.720
 The opposite of faith is not heresy.

2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:49.720
 It's indifference.

2:28:49.720 --> 2:28:52.720
 And the opposite of life is not death.

2:28:52.720 --> 2:28:55.720
 It's indifference.

2:28:55.720 --> 2:28:56.720
 Thank you for listening.

2:28:56.720 --> 2:29:20.720
 I hope to see you next time.
