00:00.000 --> 00:05.160
 The following is a conversation with Roger Panrose, physicist, mathematician, and philosopher

00:05.160 --> 00:07.280
 at University of Oxford.

00:07.280 --> 00:12.080
 He has made fundamental contributions in many disciplines, from the mathematical physics

00:12.080 --> 00:18.080
 of general relativity and cosmology, to the limitations of a computational view of consciousness.

00:18.080 --> 00:22.600
 In his book, The Emperor's New Mind, Roger writes that, quote,

00:22.600 --> 00:29.960
 Children are not afraid to pose basic questions that may embarrass us as adults to ask.

00:29.960 --> 00:34.760
 In many ways, my goal with this podcast is to embrace the inner child that is not constrained

00:34.760 --> 00:41.240
 by how one should behave, speak, and think in the adult world.

00:41.240 --> 00:46.760
 Roger is one of the most important minds of our time, so it's truly a pleasure and an

00:46.760 --> 00:49.240
 honor to talk with him.

00:49.240 --> 00:53.000
 This conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.200
 For everyone feeling the medical, psychological, and financial burden of the crisis, I'm sending

00:58.200 --> 00:59.880
 love your way.

00:59.880 --> 01:00.880
 Stay strong.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.120
 We're in this together.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.240
 We'll beat this thing.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.240
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:06.240 --> 01:11.520
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars on Apple Podcasts, support

01:11.520 --> 01:18.840
 it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Freedman, spelled FRIDMAN.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.720
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break

01:22.720 --> 01:24.560
 the flow of the conversation.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.040
 I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:28.040 --> 01:33.520
 Quick summary of the ads, two sponsors, ExpressVPN and Cash App.

01:33.520 --> 01:39.400
 Please consider supporting the podcast by getting expressvpn at expressvpn.com slash

01:39.400 --> 01:46.360
 Lex pod and downloading Cash App and using code Lex podcast.

01:46.360 --> 01:50.520
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.680
 When you get it, use code Lex podcast.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.080
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with

01:58.080 --> 02:00.040
 as little as $1.

02:00.040 --> 02:05.040
 Since Cash App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm

02:05.040 --> 02:09.680
 that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is an

02:09.680 --> 02:11.320
 algorithmic marvel.

02:11.320 --> 02:16.720
 So big props to the Cash App engineers for solving a hard problem that in the end provides

02:16.720 --> 02:21.480
 an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock

02:21.480 --> 02:28.560
 market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier.

02:28.560 --> 02:34.440
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play and use the code Lex podcast,

02:34.440 --> 02:40.120
 you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping

02:40.120 --> 02:45.200
 to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.

 I love it.

02:59.400 --> 03:05.240
 It's easy to use, press the big power on button and your privacy is protected.

03:05.240 --> 03:10.080
 And if you like, you can make it look like your location is anywhere else in the world.

03:10.080 --> 03:16.080
 I might be in Boston now, but I can make it look like I'm in New York, London, Paris,

03:16.080 --> 03:17.800
 or anywhere else.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.320
 This has a large number of obvious benefits.

03:20.320 --> 03:25.200
 Certainly, it allows you to access international versions of streaming websites like the Japanese

03:25.200 --> 03:28.440
 Netflix or the UK Hulu.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.600
 ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.

03:31.600 --> 03:37.760
 I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu, Windows, Android, but it's available everywhere else

03:37.760 --> 03:38.760
 too.

03:38.760 --> 03:44.960
 Once again, get it at expressvpn.com slash Lex pod to get a discount and to support this

03:44.960 --> 03:46.560
 podcast.

03:46.560 --> 03:51.760
 And now here's my conversation with Roger Penrose.

03:51.760 --> 03:57.560
 You mentioned in conversation with Eric Weinstein on the portal podcast that 2001 Space Odyssey

03:57.560 --> 04:00.120
 is your favorite movie.

04:00.120 --> 04:05.480
 Which aspect, if you could mention, of its representation of artificial intelligence,

04:05.480 --> 04:07.840
 science, engineering connected with you?

04:07.840 --> 04:11.600
 There are all sorts of scenes there, which are so amazing.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.600
 And how the science was so well done.

04:14.600 --> 04:20.680
 I mean, people say, you know, Interstellar is this amazing movie, which is the most scientific

04:20.680 --> 04:21.680
 movie.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.600
 I thought it's not a patch on 2001.

04:24.600 --> 04:30.720
 I mean, 2001, they really went into all sorts of details regarding, you know, getting the

04:30.720 --> 04:33.160
 free fall, well done and everything.

04:33.160 --> 04:36.000
 I thought it was extremely well done.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.720
 So just the details were mesmerizing.

04:38.720 --> 04:39.720
 I don't know.

04:39.720 --> 04:45.760
 So things like the scene where at the beginning they have these sort of human ancestors, which

04:45.760 --> 04:50.520
 is sort of, right, sort of apes, apes becoming monolith.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.520
 Yes.

04:51.520 --> 04:57.200
 And well, it's the one where he throws the bone up into the air and then it becomes this.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.280
 I mean, that's an amazing sequence there.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.960
 What do you make of the monolith?

05:01.960 --> 05:06.280
 Does it have any scientific or philosophical meaning to you?

05:06.280 --> 05:08.360
 This kind of thing that sparks innovation?

05:08.360 --> 05:10.320
 Not really.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.720
 That comes from Arthur C. Clarke.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.360
 I was always a great fan of Arthur C. Clarke.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.960
 So it's just a nice plot device.

05:15.960 --> 05:16.960
 Yeah.

05:16.960 --> 05:17.960
 Oh, that plot is excellent.

05:17.960 --> 05:18.960
 Yes.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.960
 Yeah.

05:19.960 --> 05:25.800
 And then Halzen decides to get rid of the astronauts because he, it, she believes that

05:25.800 --> 05:27.880
 they will interfere with the mission.

05:27.880 --> 05:28.880
 That's right.

05:28.880 --> 05:29.880
 Yeah.

05:29.880 --> 05:30.880
 Well, there you are.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.880
 It's this view.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.560
 I don't know whether I disagree, but because in a certain sense it was telling you it's

05:34.560 --> 05:35.560
 wrong.

05:35.560 --> 05:44.800
 See, the machine seemed to think it was superior to the human and so it was entitled to get

05:44.800 --> 05:47.480
 rid of the human beings and run the show itself.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.480
 Well, do you think Hal did the right thing?

05:49.480 --> 05:55.880
 Do you think Hal's flawed, evil, or if we think about systems like Hal, would we want

05:55.880 --> 05:58.120
 Hal to do the same thing in the future?

05:58.120 --> 05:59.120
 What was the flaw there?

05:59.120 --> 06:01.720
 Well, you're basically touching on questions.

06:01.720 --> 06:06.480
 You see, it's one supposed to believe that Hal was actually conscious.

06:06.480 --> 06:13.920
 I mean, it was played rather that way as though Hal was a conscious being.

06:13.920 --> 06:22.560
 Because Hal showed some pain, some cognizant, Hal appeared to be cognizant of what it means

06:22.560 --> 06:28.280
 to die and therefore had an inkling of consciousness.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.280
 Yeah.

06:29.280 --> 06:33.960
 I mean, I'm not sure that aspect of it was made completely clear whether Hal was really

06:33.960 --> 06:39.240
 a just a very sophisticated computer, which really didn't actually have these feelings

06:39.240 --> 06:42.400
 and somehow, but you're right.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.760
 It didn't like the idea of being turned off.

06:45.760 --> 06:49.040
 How does it change things if Hal was or wasn't conscious?

06:49.040 --> 06:55.160
 Well, it might say that it would be wrong to turn it off if it was actually conscious.

06:55.160 --> 07:03.120
 I mean, these questions arise if you think, I mean, AI, one of the ideas, it's sort of

07:03.120 --> 07:04.360
 a mixture in a sense.

07:04.360 --> 07:10.880
 You say, if it's trying to do everything a human can do and if you take the view that

07:10.880 --> 07:15.760
 consciousness is something which would come along when the computer is sufficiently complicated,

07:15.760 --> 07:24.120
 sufficiently whatever criteria you use to characterize its consciousness in terms of

07:24.120 --> 07:28.800
 some computational criterion.

07:28.800 --> 07:35.320
 So how does consciousness change our evaluation of the decision that Hal made?

07:35.320 --> 07:36.320
 Yes.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.440
 I guess I was trying to say that people are a bit confused about this because if they

07:39.440 --> 07:45.200
 say these machines will become conscious, but just simply because it's a degree of computation

07:45.200 --> 07:49.520
 and when you get beyond that certain degree of computation, it will become conscious,

07:49.520 --> 07:52.280
 then of course you have all these problems.

07:52.280 --> 07:56.400
 I mean, you might say, well, one of the reasons you're doing AI is because you understand

07:56.400 --> 08:01.400
 a device out to some distant planet and you don't want to send a human out there because

08:01.400 --> 08:05.440
 then you'd have to bring it back again and that costs you far more than just sending

08:05.440 --> 08:07.120
 it there and leaving it there.

08:07.120 --> 08:11.360
 But if this device is actually a conscious entity, then you have to face up to the fact

08:11.360 --> 08:13.200
 that that's immoral.

08:13.200 --> 08:22.760
 And so the mere fact that you're making some AI device and thinking that removes your responsibility

08:22.760 --> 08:25.880
 to it would be incorrect.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.600
 And so this is a sound of flaw in that kind of viewpoint.

08:29.600 --> 08:37.000
 I'm not sure how people who take it very seriously, I mean, I had this curious conversation

08:37.000 --> 08:42.520
 with, I'm going to forget names and I'm afraid because this is what happens to me at the

08:42.520 --> 08:45.520
 wrong moment, Hofstadter, Douglas Hofstadter.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.520
 Douglas Hofstadter, yeah.

08:46.520 --> 08:52.520
 And he'd written this book, I wish I liked, I thought it was a fantastic book.

08:52.520 --> 08:57.640
 But I didn't agree with his conclusion from Gödel's theorem, I think he got it wrong,

08:57.640 --> 08:58.640
 you see.

08:58.640 --> 09:02.920
 Well, I'll just tell you my story, you see, because I'd never met him.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.760
 And then I knew I was going to meet him.

09:04.760 --> 09:08.520
 At the occasion, I realized he was coming and he wanted to talk to me and I said, that's

09:08.520 --> 09:09.520
 fine.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.840
 And I thought in my mind, well, I'm going to paint him into a corner, you see, because

09:12.840 --> 09:19.600
 I'll use his arguments to convince him that certain numbers are conscious, you know, some

09:19.600 --> 09:22.880
 integers, large enough integers are actually conscious.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.960
 And this was going to be my reductive, I'd absurd them.

09:24.960 --> 09:29.080
 And so I started having this argument with him, he simply leapt into the corner, he didn't

09:29.080 --> 09:33.320
 even need to be painted into it, he took the view that certain numbers were conscious.

09:33.320 --> 09:37.560
 I thought that was the reductive, I'd absurd them, but he seemed to think it was perfectly

09:37.560 --> 09:39.120
 reasonable point of view.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.280
 Without the absurd them there, yes, interesting.

09:42.280 --> 09:47.200
 But the thing you mentioned about how is the intuition that a lot of the people, at least

09:47.200 --> 09:52.800
 in the artificial intelligence world had and have, I think, they don't make it explicit,

09:52.800 --> 09:58.840
 but that if you increase the power of computation, naturally consciousness will emerge.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.360
 Yes, I think that's what they think.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.560
 But basically that's because they can't think of anything else.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.560
 Well, that's right.

10:03.560 --> 10:09.120
 And so it's a reasonable thing, I mean, you think what the brain do does do a lot of computation.

10:09.120 --> 10:14.280
 I think most of what you actually call computation is done by the cerebellum.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.240
 I mean, this is one of the things that people don't much mention.

10:17.240 --> 10:22.600
 I mean, I come to this subject from the outside and certain things strike me, which you hardly

10:22.600 --> 10:24.040
 ever hear mentioned.

10:24.040 --> 10:30.520
 I mean, you hear mentioned about the left right business, the move your right arm, that's

10:30.520 --> 10:34.400
 your left side of the brain and so on and all that sort of stuff.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.960
 And it's more than that.

10:36.960 --> 10:41.560
 If you have these plots of different parts of the brain, there are two of these things

10:41.560 --> 10:49.040
 called the homunculi, which you see these pictures of a distorted human figure and showing

10:49.040 --> 10:53.280
 different parts of the brain controlling different parts of the body.

10:53.280 --> 10:59.600
 And it's not simply things like, okay, the right hand is controlled and both sensory

10:59.600 --> 11:06.320
 and motor on the left side, left hand on the right side, it's more than that.

11:06.320 --> 11:13.040
 Vision is at the back basically, your feet at the top, and so it's about the worst organization

11:13.040 --> 11:14.040
 you could imagine.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.040
 Right, yeah.

11:15.040 --> 11:19.600
 So it can't just be a mistake in nature, there's something going on there.

11:19.600 --> 11:25.680
 And this is made more pronounced when you think of the cerebellum.

11:25.680 --> 11:30.800
 The cerebellum has, when I was first thinking about these things, I was told that it had

11:30.800 --> 11:34.080
 half as many neurons or something like that, comparable.

11:34.080 --> 11:38.360
 And now they tell me it's got far more neurons than the cerebrum.

11:38.360 --> 11:42.560
 The cerebrum is this sort of convoluted thing at the top, people always talk about cerebellum

11:42.560 --> 11:48.040
 is this thing, just looks a bit like a ball of wool, right at the back underneath them.

11:48.040 --> 11:53.920
 It's got more neurons, it's got more connections, computationally, it's got much more going

11:53.920 --> 11:58.600
 on than this, from the cerebrum.

11:58.600 --> 12:03.040
 But as far as we know, although it's slightly controversial, the cerebellum is entirely

12:03.040 --> 12:04.040
 unconscious.

12:04.040 --> 12:10.400
 So the actions, you have a pianist who plays an incredible piece of music and think of,

12:10.400 --> 12:16.120
 and he moves his little finger into this little key to get it hit at just the right moment.

12:16.120 --> 12:21.560
 Does he or she consciously will that movement?

12:21.560 --> 12:22.560
 No.

12:22.560 --> 12:27.240
 Okay, the consciousness is coming in, it's probably to do with the feeling of the piece

12:27.240 --> 12:32.080
 of music is being performed and that sort of thing, which is going on, but the details

12:32.080 --> 12:34.960
 and what's going on are controlled.

12:34.960 --> 12:38.800
 I would think almost entirely by the cerebellum.

12:38.800 --> 12:46.240
 That's where you have this precision and the really detailed, once you get, I mean, you

12:46.240 --> 12:51.160
 think of a tennis player or something, does that tennis player think exactly which muscles

12:51.160 --> 12:55.920
 should be moved in what direction and so on, no, of course not, but he or she will maybe

12:55.920 --> 12:59.960
 think, well, if the ball is angled in such a way in that corner, that will be tricky

12:59.960 --> 13:02.360
 for the opponent.

13:02.360 --> 13:09.440
 And the details of that are all done largely with the cerebellum, that's where all the

13:09.440 --> 13:13.160
 precise motions, but it's unconscious.

13:13.160 --> 13:18.080
 So why is it interesting to you that so much computation is done in the cerebellum and

13:18.080 --> 13:19.720
 yet is unconscious?

13:19.720 --> 13:27.600
 Because it's the view that somehow it's computation, which is producing the consciousness.

13:27.600 --> 13:34.440
 And here you have an incredible amount of computation going on, and as far as we know,

13:34.440 --> 13:37.080
 it's completely unconscious.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.560
 So why, what's the difference?

13:39.560 --> 13:44.040
 And I think it's an important thing, what's the difference?

13:44.040 --> 13:50.680
 Why is the cerebrum, all this very peculiar stuff that very hard to see on a computational

13:50.680 --> 13:55.600
 perspective, like having everything have to cross over under the other side and do something

13:55.600 --> 13:58.520
 which looks completely inefficient.

13:58.520 --> 14:04.920
 And you've got funny things like the frontal lobe and the, what do we call the lobes?

14:04.920 --> 14:12.480
 And the place where they come together, you have the different parts, the control, you

14:12.480 --> 14:16.560
 see one to do with motor and the other to do with sensory.

14:16.560 --> 14:21.360
 And they sort of opposite each other rather than being connected by, it's not as though

14:21.360 --> 14:26.400
 you've got electrical circuits, there's something else going on there.

14:26.400 --> 14:33.720
 So it's just the idea that it's like a complicated computer, it just seems to me to be completely

14:33.720 --> 14:34.720
 missing the point.

14:34.720 --> 14:39.400
 There must be a lot of computation going on, but the cerebellum seems to be much better

14:39.400 --> 14:42.960
 at doing that than the cerebrum is.

14:42.960 --> 14:49.400
 So for sure, I think what explains it is like half hope and half we don't know what's going

14:49.400 --> 14:55.000
 on and therefore from the computer science perspective, you hope that a Turing machine

14:55.000 --> 14:57.760
 can be perfectly, can achieve general intelligence.

14:57.760 --> 15:06.320
 Well, you have this wonderful thing about Turing and Gertl and Church and Cary and various

15:06.320 --> 15:13.600
 people, particularly Turing, and I guess Post was the other one, these people who develop

15:13.600 --> 15:17.840
 the idea of what a computation is.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.600
 And there were different ideas of what a computer developed differently.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.960
 I mean, Church is where they're doing it was very different from Turing's, but then they

15:24.960 --> 15:26.920
 were shown to be equivalent.

15:26.920 --> 15:35.240
 And so the view emerged that what we mean by a computation is a very clear concept.

15:35.240 --> 15:40.480
 And one of the wonderful things that Turing did was to show that you could have what we

15:40.480 --> 15:43.600
 call a universal Turing machine.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.680
 You just have to have a certain finite device.

15:45.680 --> 15:50.320
 Okay, it has to have an unlimited storage space, which is accessible to it, but the

15:50.320 --> 15:56.120
 actual computation, if you like, is performed by this one universal device.

15:56.120 --> 16:02.400
 And so the view comes away, well, you have this universal Turing machine and maybe the

16:02.400 --> 16:07.520
 brain is something like that, a universal Turing machine, and it's got maybe not an

16:07.520 --> 16:12.760
 unlimited storage, but a huge storage accessible to it.

16:12.760 --> 16:17.480
 And this model is one, which is what's used in ordinary computation.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.480
 It's a very powerful model.

16:19.480 --> 16:24.600
 And the universalness of computation is very useful.

16:24.600 --> 16:29.240
 You can have some problem and you may not see immediately how to put it onto a computer,

16:29.240 --> 16:37.160
 but if it is something of that nature, then there are all sorts of subprograms and subroutines

16:37.160 --> 16:38.160
 and all the...

16:38.160 --> 16:42.680
 I mean, I learned a little bit of computing when I was a student, but not very much.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.120
 But it was enough to get the general ideas.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.760
 And there's something really pleasant about a formal system like that, where you can start

16:49.760 --> 16:52.800
 discussing about what's provable, what's not, these kinds of things.

16:52.800 --> 16:58.800
 And you've got a notion, which is an absolute notion, this notion of computability and address

16:58.800 --> 17:03.680
 when mathematical problems are computably solvable and what chance.

17:03.680 --> 17:09.560
 And it's a very beautiful area of mathematics and it's a very powerful area of mathematics

17:09.560 --> 17:19.800
 and it underlies the whole principles of computing machines that we have today.

17:19.800 --> 17:24.240
 Could you say what is Gato's incompleteness theorem and how does it...

17:24.240 --> 17:29.480
 He also says it's heartbreaking to you and how does it interfere with this notion of

17:29.480 --> 17:32.680
 computation and consciousness?

17:32.680 --> 17:33.680
 Sure.

17:33.680 --> 17:40.600
 Well, the ideas, basically, ideas which I formulated in my first year as a graduate student in

17:40.600 --> 17:41.600
 Cambridge.

17:41.600 --> 17:47.560
 I did my undergraduate work in mathematics in London and I had a colleague, Ian Percival.

17:47.560 --> 17:52.280
 We used to discuss things like computational and logical systems quite a lot.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.480
 I'd heard about Gerdl's theorem and I was a bit worried by the idea that it seemed

17:55.480 --> 18:00.040
 to say there were things in mathematics that you could never prove.

18:00.040 --> 18:07.000
 And so when I went to Cambridge as a graduate student, I went to various courses.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.520
 You see, I was doing pure mathematics.

18:08.520 --> 18:13.960
 I was doing algebraic geometry of a sort, a little bit different from all my supervisors

18:13.960 --> 18:14.960
 and people.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.920
 But it was algebraic geometry.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.240
 And I was interested.

18:20.240 --> 18:26.480
 I got particularly interested in three lecture courses that were nothing to do with what

18:26.480 --> 18:28.400
 I was supposed to be doing.

18:28.400 --> 18:33.800
 One was a course by Herman Bondi on Einstein's general theory of relativity, which was a

18:33.800 --> 18:34.800
 beautiful course.

18:34.800 --> 18:40.360
 He was an amazing lecturer, brought these things alive, absolutely.

18:40.360 --> 18:47.920
 And now there was a course on quantum mechanics, given by the great physicist Paul Dirac.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.640
 It was a beautiful course in a completely different way.

18:50.640 --> 18:56.600
 He was very kind of organized and never got excited about anything, seemingly.

18:56.600 --> 19:02.880
 But it was extremely well put together and I found that amazing too.

19:02.880 --> 19:07.360
 The third course that was nothing to do with what I should be doing was a course on mathematical

19:07.360 --> 19:08.360
 logic.

19:08.360 --> 19:13.000
 And I got excited, as I say, my discussions with Ian Percival.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.880
 There's an incompleteness theorem already deeply within mathematical logic.

19:18.880 --> 19:19.880
 Were you introduced to it?

19:19.880 --> 19:25.240
 I was introduced to it in detail by the course by Steen.

19:25.240 --> 19:31.240
 And it was two things he described, which were very fundamental to my understanding.

19:31.240 --> 19:35.920
 One was Turing machines and the whole idea of computability and all that.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.320
 So that was all very much part of the course.

19:38.320 --> 19:43.720
 The other one was the girdle theorem, and it wasn't what I was afraid it was to tell

19:43.720 --> 19:47.160
 you there were things in mathematics you couldn't prove.

19:47.160 --> 19:53.200
 It was basically, and he phrased it in a way which often people didn't.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.520
 And if you read Douglass Hofstadter's book, he doesn't, you see.

19:56.520 --> 20:02.840
 But Steen made it very clear and also in a sort of public lecture that he gave to a mathematical,

20:02.840 --> 20:07.200
 I think it may be the Adams Society, one of the mathematical undergraduate societies,

20:07.200 --> 20:11.920
 and he made this point again very clearly, that if you've got a formal system of proof.

20:11.920 --> 20:19.280
 So suppose what you mean by proof is something which you could check with a computer.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.520
 So to say whether you've got it right or not, you've got a lot of steps.

20:22.520 --> 20:30.680
 Have you carried this computational procedure following the proof, steps of the proof correctly,

20:30.680 --> 20:35.560
 that can be checked by an algorithm, by a computer.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.880
 So that's the key thing.

20:38.880 --> 20:44.520
 Now what, you have to, now you see, is this any good?

20:44.520 --> 20:50.320
 If you've got an algorithmic system which claims to say, yes, this is right, no, you've

20:50.320 --> 20:55.080
 proved it correctly, this is true, if you've proved it, if you made a mistake, it doesn't

20:55.080 --> 20:59.920
 say it's true or false, but if you've done it right, then the conclusion you've come

20:59.920 --> 21:01.320
 to is correct.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.960
 Now you say, why do you believe it's correct?

21:03.960 --> 21:06.920
 Because you've looked at the rules and you said, well, okay, that one's all right, yeah,

21:06.920 --> 21:10.640
 that one's all right, what about, oh, yeah, I see, I see why it's all right, okay.

21:10.640 --> 21:15.080
 You go through all the rules, you say, yes, following those rules, if it says yes, it's

21:15.080 --> 21:16.880
 true, it is true.

21:16.880 --> 21:22.080
 So you've got to make sure that these rules are ones that you trust.

21:22.080 --> 21:27.680
 If you follow the rules and it says it's a proof, is the result actually true?

21:27.680 --> 21:32.760
 And that your belief that it's true depends upon looking at the rules and understanding

21:32.760 --> 21:34.520
 them.

21:34.520 --> 21:41.360
 Now what Goethe shows is that if you have such a system, then you can construct a statement

21:41.360 --> 21:46.080
 of the very kind that it's supposed to look at, a mathematical statement, and you can

21:46.080 --> 21:55.280
 see by the way it's constructed and what it means that it's true, but not provable

21:55.280 --> 22:00.960
 by the rules that you've been given, and it depends on your trust in the rules.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.400
 Do you believe that the rules only give you truth?

22:03.400 --> 22:07.600
 If you believe the rules only give you truth, then you believe this other statement is also

22:07.600 --> 22:08.600
 true.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.880
 I found this absolutely mind blowing.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.200
 When I saw this, it blew my mind.

22:13.200 --> 22:20.000
 I thought, my God, you can see that this statement is true, it's as good as any proof, because

22:20.000 --> 22:26.720
 it only depends on your belief in the reliability of the proof procedure, that's all it is,

22:26.720 --> 22:32.040
 and understanding that the coding is done correctly, and it enables you to transcend

22:32.040 --> 22:33.920
 that system.

22:33.920 --> 22:39.480
 So whatever system you have, as long as you can understand what it's doing and why you

22:39.480 --> 22:44.080
 believe it only gives you truth, then you can see beyond that system.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.400
 Now how do you see beyond it?

22:46.400 --> 22:51.000
 What is it that enables you to transcend that system?

22:51.000 --> 22:56.680
 Well, it's your understanding of what the system is actually saying, and what the statement

22:56.680 --> 22:59.520
 that you've constructed is actually saying.

22:59.520 --> 23:05.640
 So it's this quality of understanding, whatever it is, which is not governed by rules.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.480
 It's not a computational procedure.

23:07.480 --> 23:13.280
 So this idea of understanding is not going to be within the rules of the formal system.

23:13.280 --> 23:18.240
 Yes, you're only using those rules anyway, because you have understood them to be rules

23:18.240 --> 23:19.760
 which only give you truth.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.000
 There'd be no point in it otherwise.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.080
 I mean, people say, well, okay, this is one set of rules as good as any other.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.080
 Well, it's not true.

23:29.080 --> 23:33.600
 You have to understand what the rules mean, and why does that understanding of the mean

23:33.600 --> 23:36.920
 give you something beyond the rules themselves?

23:36.920 --> 23:37.920
 That's what it was.

23:37.920 --> 23:38.920
 That's what blew my mind.

23:38.920 --> 23:45.120
 It's somehow understanding why the rules give you truth enables you to transcend the

23:45.120 --> 23:46.120
 rules.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.840
 So that's where, I mean, even at that time, that's already where the thought entered your

23:49.840 --> 23:56.800
 mind that the idea of understanding, or we can start calling it things like intelligence

23:56.800 --> 23:59.840
 or even consciousness is outside the rules.

23:59.840 --> 24:00.840
 Yes.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.440
 I've always concentrated on understanding.

24:03.440 --> 24:08.960
 People say, people are talking about creativity, that's something a machine can't do as creative.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.600
 Well, I don't know what is creativity, and I don't know.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.840
 Somebody can put some funny things on a piece of paper and say, that's creative, and you

24:15.840 --> 24:16.840
 could make a machine do that.

24:16.840 --> 24:17.840
 Is it really creative?

24:17.840 --> 24:18.840
 I don't know.

24:18.840 --> 24:20.560
 You say, I worry about that one.

24:20.560 --> 24:25.600
 I sort of agree with it in a sense, but it's so hard to do anything with that statement.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.880
 But understanding, yes, you can.

24:27.880 --> 24:33.840
 You can go see that understanding whatever it is, and it's very hard to put your finger

24:33.840 --> 24:34.840
 on it.

24:34.840 --> 24:35.920
 That's absolutely true.

24:35.920 --> 24:42.080
 Can you try to define or maybe dance around a definition of understanding?

24:42.080 --> 24:47.160
 There's some degree, but I often wondered about this, but there is something there which

24:47.160 --> 24:50.160
 is very slippery.

24:50.160 --> 24:56.800
 It's something like standing back, and it's also got to be something which was of value

24:56.800 --> 25:03.080
 to our remote ancestors, because sometimes there's a cartoon, which I drew sometimes

25:03.080 --> 25:07.880
 showing you how all these, in the foreground you see this mathematician just doing some

25:07.880 --> 25:08.880
 mathematical theorem.

25:08.880 --> 25:12.400
 There's a little bit of a joke in that theorem, but let's not go into that.

25:12.400 --> 25:17.640
 He's trying to prove some theorem, and he's about to be eaten by a saber toothed tiger

25:17.640 --> 25:21.360
 who's hiding in the undergrowth, you see.

25:21.360 --> 25:29.800
 And in the distance, you see his cousins building growing crops, building shelters, domesticating

25:29.800 --> 25:30.800
 animals.

25:30.800 --> 25:34.200
 And in the slight foreground, you see they've built a mammoth trap, and this poor old mammoth

25:34.200 --> 25:36.320
 is falling into a pit.

25:36.320 --> 25:40.200
 You see, and all these people around them are about to grab him, you see.

25:40.200 --> 25:46.520
 And well, you see, those are the ones who, the quality of understanding, which goes with

25:46.520 --> 25:50.920
 all the, it's not just the mathematician doing his mathematics.

25:50.920 --> 25:58.280
 This understanding quality is something else, which has been a tremendous advantage to us,

25:58.280 --> 25:59.280
 not just to us.

25:59.280 --> 26:03.240
 See, I don't think consciousness is limited to humans.

26:03.240 --> 26:07.480
 Yeah, that's the interesting question, at which point, if it is indeed connected to

26:07.480 --> 26:11.160
 the evolutionary process, at which point did we pick up this?

26:11.160 --> 26:13.600
 A very hard question.

26:13.600 --> 26:19.880
 It's certainly, I don't think it's primates, you see these pictures of African hunting

26:19.880 --> 26:25.880
 dogs and how they can plan amongst themselves how to catch the antelopes.

26:25.880 --> 26:29.280
 Some of these David Attenborough films, I think it's probably one of them.

26:29.280 --> 26:34.480
 And you can see the hunting dogs, and they divide themselves into two groups, and they

26:34.480 --> 26:37.000
 go in two routes, two different routes.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.840
 One of them goes and they sort of hide next to the river.

26:40.840 --> 26:46.680
 And the other group goes around and they start yelping at these, they don't bark, I guess

26:46.680 --> 26:49.960
 whatever noise hunting dogs do, the antelopes.

26:49.960 --> 26:54.920
 And they sort of round them up and they chase them in the direction of the river.

26:54.920 --> 26:58.600
 And they're the other ones just waiting for them just to get, because when they get to

26:58.600 --> 27:00.400
 the river, it slows them down.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.160
 And so they pounce on them.

27:02.160 --> 27:07.920
 So they've obviously planned this all out, somehow, I have no idea how.

27:07.920 --> 27:12.240
 And there is some element of conscious planning, as far as I can see.

27:12.240 --> 27:19.760
 I don't think it's just some kind of, so much of AI these days is done, they call bottom

27:19.760 --> 27:20.760
 up systems.

27:20.760 --> 27:27.000
 Is it where you have neural networks and you give them a zillion different things to look

27:27.000 --> 27:34.720
 at, and then they sort of can choose one thing over another, just because it's seen so many

27:34.720 --> 27:41.640
 examples and picks up on little signals, which one may not even be conscious of.

27:41.640 --> 27:43.240
 And that doesn't feel like understanding.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.440
 There's no understanding in that whatsoever.

27:45.440 --> 27:48.520
 Well, you're being a little bit human centric.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.680
 So I think I would expect...

27:50.680 --> 27:51.680
 Well, I'm talking about...

27:51.680 --> 27:52.680
 See, I'm not with the dogs, am I?

27:52.680 --> 27:53.680
 No, you're not.

27:53.680 --> 27:59.400
 Sorry, not human centric, but I misspoke, biology centric.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.560
 Is it possible that consciousness would just look slightly different?

28:02.560 --> 28:05.720
 Well, I'm not saying it's biological, because we don't know.

28:05.720 --> 28:06.720
 Right.

28:06.720 --> 28:11.840
 I think other examples of the elephants is a wonderful example, too, where this was,

28:11.840 --> 28:17.520
 I think this was at number one, where the elephants have to go from the long, the troop

28:17.520 --> 28:21.640
 of them have to go long distances, and the leader of a troop is a female.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.760
 They all are, apparently.

28:23.760 --> 28:30.200
 And this female, she had to go all the way from one part of the country to another.

28:30.200 --> 28:35.080
 And at a certain point, she made a detour, and they went off in this big detour.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.280
 All the troop came with her.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.920
 And this is where her sister had died.

28:39.920 --> 28:43.280
 And there were her bones lying around, and they go and pick up the bones, and they hand

28:43.280 --> 28:47.280
 it around, and they caress the bones, and then they put them back, and they will go

28:47.280 --> 28:48.280
 back again.

28:48.280 --> 28:51.440
 What in the hell are they doing?

28:51.440 --> 28:52.440
 That's so interesting.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.640
 I mean, there's something going on.

28:54.640 --> 28:59.600
 There's no clear connection with natural selection.

28:59.600 --> 29:03.160
 There's just some deep feeling going on there.

29:03.160 --> 29:07.320
 We have to do with their conscious experience.

29:07.320 --> 29:15.160
 And I think it's something that, overall, is advantageous, unnatural selection, but

29:15.160 --> 29:18.680
 not directly to do with natural selection.

29:18.680 --> 29:22.600
 I like that there's something going on there.

29:22.600 --> 29:28.920
 Like I told you, I'm Russian, so I tend to romanticize all things of this nature, that

29:28.920 --> 29:32.560
 it's not merely cold, hard computation.

29:32.560 --> 29:35.920
 Perhaps I could just slightly answer your question.

29:35.920 --> 29:38.720
 You were asking me, what is it?

29:38.720 --> 29:43.960
 There's something about sort of standing back and thinking about your own thought processes.

29:43.960 --> 29:49.120
 I mean, there is something like that in the girdle thing, because if you're not following

29:49.120 --> 29:53.640
 the rules, you're standing back and thinking about the rules.

29:53.640 --> 29:58.280
 And so there is something that you might say, you think about you're doing something, and

29:58.280 --> 30:00.240
 you think, what the hell am I doing?

30:00.240 --> 30:04.360
 And you sort of stand back and think about what it is that's making you think in such

30:04.360 --> 30:05.360
 a way.

30:05.360 --> 30:08.600
 Just take a step back outside the game you've been playing.

30:08.600 --> 30:09.600
 Yeah.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.640
 You back up, and you think about, you're just not playing the game anymore.

30:12.640 --> 30:16.160
 You're thinking about what the hell you're doing in playing this game.

30:16.160 --> 30:22.120
 And that's somehow, it's not a very precise description, but somehow it feels very true

30:22.120 --> 30:25.880
 that that's somehow understanding, this kind of reflection.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.360
 A reflection, yes.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.360
 Yeah.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.360
 Yeah.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.840
 It's a bit hard to put your finger on, but there is something there which I think maybe

30:32.840 --> 30:36.960
 could be unearthed at some point, and see this is really what's going on.

30:36.960 --> 30:40.280
 Why conscious beings have this advantage?

30:40.280 --> 30:44.160
 What it is that gives them advantage, and I think it goes way back.

30:44.160 --> 30:49.240
 I don't think, we're talking about the hunting dogs and the elephants, that's pretty clear

30:49.240 --> 30:54.400
 that octopuses have the same sort of quality, and we call it consciousness.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.400
 Yeah, I think so.

30:55.400 --> 31:01.760
 I've seen enough examples of the way that they behave, and the evolution route is completely

31:01.760 --> 31:02.760
 different.

31:02.760 --> 31:07.640
 Does it go way back to some common ancestor, or did it come separately?

31:07.640 --> 31:13.680
 My hope is it's something simple, but the hard question, if there's a hardware prerequisite,

31:13.680 --> 31:19.080
 we have to develop some kind of hardware mechanisms in our computers.

31:19.080 --> 31:23.760
 Basically, as you suggest, and we'll get to in a second, we kind of have to throw away

31:23.760 --> 31:30.360
 the computer as we know it today, the deterministic machines we know today to try to create it.

31:30.360 --> 31:32.880
 My hope, of course, is not.

31:32.880 --> 31:40.080
 Well, I should go really back to the story, which in a sense, I haven't finished, because

31:40.080 --> 31:44.920
 I went to these three courses, you see, when I was a graduate student, and so I started

31:44.920 --> 31:50.080
 to think, well, I'm really, I'm a pretty, what you might call a materialist in the sense

31:50.080 --> 31:55.080
 of thinking that there's no kind of mystical or something or other, which comes in from

31:55.080 --> 31:56.080
 who knows where.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.080
 You still that?

31:57.080 --> 31:58.520
 Yeah, you still throughout your life been a materialist?

31:58.520 --> 32:03.000
 I don't like the word materialist because it suggests we know what material is, and

32:03.000 --> 32:07.760
 that is a bad word because there's no mystical.

32:07.760 --> 32:11.840
 It's not some mystical something which is not treatable by science.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.840
 That's so beautifully put.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.440
 Just to pause on that for a second.

32:14.440 --> 32:18.600
 You're a materialist, but you acknowledge that we don't really know what the material

32:18.600 --> 32:19.600
 is.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.600
 That's right.

32:20.600 --> 32:28.080
 I mean, I like to call myself a scientist, I suppose, but it means that, yes, what you

32:28.080 --> 32:29.800
 see, the question goes on here.

32:29.800 --> 32:36.440
 So I began thinking, okay, if consciousness or understanding is something which is not

32:36.440 --> 32:40.160
 a computational process, what can it be?

32:40.160 --> 32:46.480
 And I knew enough from my undergraduate work, I knew about Newtonian mechanics, and I knew

32:46.480 --> 32:50.240
 how basically you could put it on a computer.

32:50.240 --> 32:56.200
 There is a fundamental issue which is this important or not that computation depends

32:56.200 --> 33:04.440
 upon discrete things, so you're using discrete elements, whereas the physical laws depend

33:04.440 --> 33:06.640
 on the continuum.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.760
 Is this something to do with it?

33:09.760 --> 33:13.000
 Is it the fact that we use the continuum in our physics?

33:13.000 --> 33:19.040
 And if we model our physical system, we use discrete systems like ordinary computers.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.920
 I came to the view that that's probably not it.

33:21.920 --> 33:28.440
 I might have to retract on that someday, but the view was no, you can get close enough.

33:28.440 --> 33:33.360
 It's not altogether clear, I have to say, but you can get close enough.

33:33.360 --> 33:38.160
 And I went to this course by Bondi on general relativity, and I thought, well, you can put

33:38.160 --> 33:39.160
 that on a computer.

33:39.160 --> 33:44.400
 Of course, that was a long time before people, and I've sort of grown up with this, how people

33:44.400 --> 33:48.400
 have done better and better calculations, and they could work out black holes, and they

33:48.400 --> 33:53.080
 can then work out how black holes can interact with each other, spar around, and what kind

33:53.080 --> 33:58.680
 of gravitational waves can out, and there's a very impressive piece of computational work,

33:58.680 --> 34:02.040
 how you can actually work out the shapes of those signals.

34:02.040 --> 34:06.120
 Now we have LIGO seeing these signals, and they say, yeah, those black holes spiral into

34:06.120 --> 34:07.520
 each other.

34:07.520 --> 34:14.880
 This is just a vindication of the power of computation in describing Einstein's general

34:14.880 --> 34:15.880
 relativity.

34:15.880 --> 34:22.760
 So in that case, we can get close, but with computation, we can get close to understanding

34:22.760 --> 34:23.760
 the physics.

34:23.760 --> 34:24.760
 You can get very, very close.

34:24.760 --> 34:27.040
 Now, is that close enough, you see?

34:27.040 --> 34:29.000
 And then I went to this course by Dirac.

34:29.000 --> 34:35.320
 Now, you see, I think it was the very first lecture that he gave, and he was talking about

34:35.320 --> 34:40.520
 the superposition principle, and he said, if you have a particle, you usually think of

34:40.520 --> 34:45.160
 particle can be over here or over there, but in quantum mechanics, it can be over here

34:45.160 --> 34:48.160
 and over there at the same time.

34:48.160 --> 34:54.240
 And you have these states which involve a superposition, in some sense, of different

34:54.240 --> 34:56.760
 locations for that particle.

34:56.760 --> 35:00.320
 And then he got out his piece of chalk, and some people say he broke it in two as a kind

35:00.320 --> 35:05.120
 of illustration of how the piece of chalk might be over here and over there at the same

35:05.120 --> 35:06.880
 time.

35:06.880 --> 35:13.400
 And he was talking about this, and my mind wondered, I don't remember what he said.

35:13.400 --> 35:17.760
 All I can remember, he's just moved on to the next topic, and something about energy

35:17.760 --> 35:21.160
 he'd mentioned, which I had no idea what had to do with anything.

35:21.160 --> 35:25.320
 And so I'd been struck with this and worried about it ever since.

35:25.320 --> 35:28.720
 It's probably just as well, I didn't hear his explanation, because it was probably one

35:28.720 --> 35:33.720
 of these things to calm me down and not worry about it anymore, whereas in my case, I've

35:33.720 --> 35:35.960
 worried about it ever since.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.520
 So I thought, maybe that's the catch.

35:38.520 --> 35:45.280
 There is something in quantum mechanics, where these superpositions become one or the other.

35:45.280 --> 35:50.040
 And that's not part of quantum mechanics, there's something missing in the theory.

35:50.040 --> 35:55.280
 The theory is incomplete, it's not just incomplete, it's in a certain sense not quite right.

35:55.280 --> 35:59.480
 Because if you follow the equation, the basic equation of quantum mechanics, that's the

35:59.480 --> 36:03.640
 Schrodinger equation, you could put that on a computer too, there are lots of difficulties

36:03.640 --> 36:07.560
 about how many parameters you have to put in and so on, that can be very tricky.

36:07.560 --> 36:13.480
 But nevertheless, it is a computational process, modulo this question about the continuum

36:13.480 --> 36:17.000
 as before, but it's not clear that makes any difference.

36:17.000 --> 36:23.040
 So our theories of quantum mechanics may be missing the same element that the universal

36:23.040 --> 36:25.480
 term machine is missing about consciousness.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.480
 Yes, yes.

36:26.480 --> 36:32.360
 Yeah, this is the view I held, is that you need a theory and that that, what people call

36:32.360 --> 36:36.800
 the reduction of the state or the collapse of the wave function, which you have to have,

36:36.800 --> 36:39.960
 otherwise quantum mechanics doesn't relate to the world we see.

36:39.960 --> 36:45.400
 To make it relate to the world we see, you've got to break the Schrodinger equation.

36:45.400 --> 36:50.560
 Schrodinger himself was absolutely appalled by this idea, his own equation.

36:50.560 --> 36:56.200
 I mean, that's why he introduced this famous Schrodinger's cat as a thought experiment.

36:56.200 --> 36:59.640
 He's really saying, look, this is where my equation leads you into it.

36:59.640 --> 37:05.640
 There's something wrong, something we haven't understood, which is basically fundamental.

37:05.640 --> 37:09.120
 And so I was trying to put all these things together and said, well, it's got to be the

37:09.120 --> 37:12.200
 noncomputability comes in there.

37:12.200 --> 37:16.920
 And I also can't remember when I thought this, but it's when gravity is involved in quantum

37:16.920 --> 37:17.920
 mechanics.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.880
 It's the combination of those two.

37:19.880 --> 37:28.000
 And that's that point when you have good reasons to believe, this came much later, that I have

37:28.000 --> 37:33.680
 good reason to believe that the principles of general relativity and those of quantum

37:33.680 --> 37:34.680
 mechanics.

37:34.680 --> 37:41.440
 Particularly, it's the basic principle of equivalence, which goes back to Galileo.

37:41.440 --> 37:46.480
 If you fall freely, you eliminate the gravitational field.

37:46.480 --> 37:52.600
 So you imagine Galileo dropping his big rock and his little rocks from the Leaning Tower,

37:52.600 --> 37:55.840
 whether he actually ever did that or not, that's pretty irrelevant.

37:55.840 --> 37:59.960
 And as the rocks fall to the ground, you have a little insect sitting on one of them looking

37:59.960 --> 38:01.520
 at the other one.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.920
 And it seems to think, oh, there's no gravity here.

38:03.920 --> 38:07.960
 Of course, it hits the ground and then you realize something's different going on.

38:07.960 --> 38:11.920
 But when it's in free fall, the gravity has been eliminated.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.400
 Galileo understood that very beautifully.

38:14.400 --> 38:18.640
 He gives these wonderful examples of fireworks.

38:18.640 --> 38:23.440
 And you see the fireworks and explode, and you see the sphere of sparkling fireworks,

38:23.440 --> 38:29.320
 and it remains a sphere as it falls down, as though there were no gravity.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.360
 So he understood that principle.

38:31.360 --> 38:33.520
 But he couldn't make a theory out of it.

38:33.520 --> 38:38.920
 Einstein came along, used exactly the same principle, and that's the basis of Einstein's

38:38.920 --> 38:41.440
 general theory of relativity.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.640
 Now there is a conflict.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.320
 This is something I did much, much later.

38:45.320 --> 38:49.000
 So this wasn't those days, much, much later.

38:49.000 --> 38:54.680
 You can see there is a basic conflict between the principle of superposition, the thing

38:54.680 --> 38:58.840
 that Dirac was talking about, and the principle of general covariant.

38:58.840 --> 39:03.760
 Well, principle of equivalence, gravitational field is equivalent to an acceleration.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.960
 Can you pause for a second?

39:04.960 --> 39:07.000
 What is the principle of equivalence?

39:07.000 --> 39:11.640
 It's this Galileo principle that we can eliminate, at least locally.

39:11.640 --> 39:16.320
 You have to be in a small neighborhood because you see if you have people dropping rocks

39:16.320 --> 39:20.000
 all around the world somewhere, you can't get rid of it all at once.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.440
 But in the local neighborhood, you can eliminate the gravitational field by falling freely

39:25.440 --> 39:26.440
 with it.

39:26.440 --> 39:30.680
 And we now see that with astronauts and they don't, you know, the Earth is right there.

39:30.680 --> 39:35.400
 You can see the great globe of the Earth right beneath them, but they don't care about it.

39:35.400 --> 39:39.120
 As far as they're concerned, there's no gravity.

39:39.120 --> 39:45.120
 They fall freely in the gravitational field, and that gets rid of the gravitational field.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.760
 And that's the principle of equivalence.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.000
 So what's the contradiction?

39:49.000 --> 39:51.120
 What's the tension with superposition and equivalence?

39:51.120 --> 39:53.120
 Well, that's technical.

39:53.120 --> 39:57.160
 So it's just a backtrack for a second just to see if we can weave a thread through it

39:57.160 --> 39:58.160
 all.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.160
 Yes.

39:59.160 --> 40:06.880
 So we started to think about consciousness as potentially needing some of the same, not

40:06.880 --> 40:08.720
 mystical, but some of the same magic.

40:08.720 --> 40:10.640
 You see, it is a complicated story.

40:10.640 --> 40:14.240
 So, you know, people think, oh, I'm drifting away from the point or something.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.760
 But I think it is a complicated story.

40:16.760 --> 40:20.600
 So what I'm trying to say, I mean, I try to put it in a nutshell, but it's not so easy.

40:20.600 --> 40:26.560
 I'm trying to say that whatever consciousness is, it's not a computation.

40:26.560 --> 40:27.560
 Yes.

40:27.560 --> 40:33.480
 Or it's not a physical process which can be described by computation.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.920
 But it nevertheless could be.

40:34.920 --> 40:41.680
 So one of the interesting models that you've proposed is the orchestrated objective reduction.

40:41.680 --> 40:42.680
 Yes.

40:42.680 --> 40:44.720
 But you see, that's going from there, you see.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.800
 So I say, I have no idea.

40:46.800 --> 40:52.080
 So I wrote this book through my scientific career, I thought, you know, when I'm retired,

40:52.080 --> 40:59.440
 I'll have enough time to write a sort of a popular book which I will explain my ideas

40:59.440 --> 41:05.200
 and puzzles, what I like, beautiful things about physics and mathematics, and this puzzle

41:05.200 --> 41:09.960
 about computability and consciousness and so on.

41:09.960 --> 41:14.360
 And in the process of writing this book, well, I thought I'd do it when I was retired.

41:14.360 --> 41:15.360
 I didn't actually.

41:15.360 --> 41:21.960
 I didn't wait that long because there was a radio discussion between Edward Fredkin

41:21.960 --> 41:24.520
 and Marvin Minsky.

41:24.520 --> 41:28.480
 And they were talking about what computers could do.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.640
 And they were entering a big room.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.040
 They imagined entering this big room.

41:32.040 --> 41:37.040
 At the other end of the room, two computers were talking to each other.

41:37.040 --> 41:43.840
 And as you walk up to the computers, they will have communicated to each other more ideas,

41:43.840 --> 41:49.200
 concepts, things than the entire human race had ever commuted at that level.

41:49.200 --> 41:53.760
 So I thought, well, I know where you're coming from, but I just don't believe you.

41:53.760 --> 41:57.200
 There's something missing.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.560
 So I thought, well, I should write my book.

42:00.560 --> 42:01.720
 And so I did.

42:01.720 --> 42:08.640
 It was roughly the same time Stephen Hawking was writing his brief history of time.

42:08.640 --> 42:11.280
 The 80s at some point.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.280
 The book you're talking about is The Emperor's New Mind.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.280
 That's right.

42:14.280 --> 42:18.160
 And both are incredible books, the brief history of time, and The Emperor's New Mind.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.160
 Yes.

42:19.160 --> 42:23.960
 It was quite interesting because he told me he'd got Carl Sagan, I think, to write it

42:23.960 --> 42:24.960
 forward.

42:24.960 --> 42:25.960
 It's a good guess.

42:25.960 --> 42:26.960
 To the book, you see.

42:26.960 --> 42:27.960
 So I thought, gosh, what am I going to do?

42:27.960 --> 42:30.960
 I'm not going to get anywhere unless I get somebody.

42:30.960 --> 42:34.480
 So I said, well, I know Martin Gardner, so I wonder if he'd do it.

42:34.480 --> 42:35.480
 So he did.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.760
 And he did a very nice forward.

42:36.760 --> 42:38.280
 So that's an incredible book.

42:38.280 --> 42:44.200
 And some of the same people you mentioned, Ed Franken, which I guess of expert systems

42:44.200 --> 42:48.240
 fame and Minsky, of course, people know in the AI world, but they represent the artificial

42:48.240 --> 42:49.240
 intelligence world.

42:49.240 --> 42:50.240
 Absolutely.

42:50.240 --> 42:51.240
 That's right.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.240
 That do hope and dream that AI's intelligence is.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.240
 That's right.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.240
 Well, you see, it was my thinking.

42:55.240 --> 42:59.200
 Well, you know, I see where they're coming from, and from that perspective, yeah, you're

42:59.200 --> 43:00.200
 right.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.760
 But that's not my perspective.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.560
 So I thought I had to say it.

43:03.560 --> 43:07.840
 And as I was writing my book, you see, I thought, well, I don't really know anything about neurophysiology.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.280
 What am I doing writing this book?

43:09.280 --> 43:13.080
 So I started reading up about neurophysiology, and I read up nothing.

43:13.080 --> 43:18.480
 And I try to find out how it is that nerve signals could possibly preserve quantum coherence.

43:18.480 --> 43:24.800
 And all I read is that the electrical signals which go along the nerves create effects through

43:24.800 --> 43:25.800
 the brain.

43:25.800 --> 43:29.920
 There's no chance you can isolate it so that this is hopeless.

43:29.920 --> 43:33.560
 So I come to the end of the book, and I more or less give up.

43:33.560 --> 43:35.880
 I just think of something which I didn't believe in.

43:35.880 --> 43:39.560
 That's maybe this is a way around it, but no.

43:39.560 --> 43:43.280
 And then you say, I thought, well, maybe this book will at least stimulate young people

43:43.280 --> 43:45.000
 to do science or something.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.040
 And I got all these letters from older, tired people instead.

43:48.040 --> 43:54.360
 These are the only people who could have time to read my book, except for Stuart Hameroff.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.360
 Except for Stuart Hameroff.

43:56.360 --> 44:01.200
 Stuart Hameroff wrote to me, and he said, I think you're missing something.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.240
 You don't know about microtubules, do you?

44:03.240 --> 44:06.040
 He didn't put it quite like that, but that was more or less it.

44:06.040 --> 44:08.960
 And he said, this is what you really need to consider.

44:08.960 --> 44:13.080
 So I thought, my God, yes, that's a much more promising structure.

44:13.080 --> 44:21.320
 So I mean, fundamentally, you were searching for the source of a noncomputable source of

44:21.320 --> 44:25.160
 consciousness within the human brain in the biology.

44:25.160 --> 44:29.920
 And so if I may ask, what are microtubules?

44:29.920 --> 44:36.360
 Well, you see, I was ignorant and what I'd read, I never came across them in the books

44:36.360 --> 44:37.360
 I looked at.

44:37.360 --> 44:41.000
 Perhaps I only read rather superficially, which is true.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.240
 But I didn't know about microtubules.

44:43.240 --> 44:47.920
 Stuart, I think one of the things he was impressed him about them is that when you see pictures

44:47.920 --> 44:54.240
 of mitosis, that's a cell dividing, and you see all the chromosomes, and the chromosomes

44:54.240 --> 44:58.120
 get, or get lined up, and then they get pulled apart.

44:58.120 --> 45:02.960
 And so that as the cell divides, the half the chromosomes go, you know, how they divide

45:02.960 --> 45:07.560
 into the two parts, and they go two different ways.

45:07.560 --> 45:09.280
 And what is it that's pulling them apart?

45:09.280 --> 45:13.040
 Well, those are these little things called microtubules.

45:13.040 --> 45:15.800
 And so he starts to get interested in them.

45:15.800 --> 45:20.880
 And he formed the view, well, he was at his day job or night job, or whatever you call

45:20.880 --> 45:26.080
 it, is to put people to sleep, except he doesn't like calling to sleep because it's different.

45:26.080 --> 45:29.400
 General anesthetics in a reversible way.

45:29.400 --> 45:35.120
 So you want to make sure that they don't experience the pain that would otherwise be something

45:35.120 --> 45:41.400
 that they feel, and consciousness is turned off for a while, and it can be turned back

45:41.400 --> 45:42.400
 on again.

45:42.400 --> 45:45.320
 So it's crucial that you can turn it off and turn it on.

45:45.320 --> 45:47.560
 And what do you do when you're doing that?

45:47.560 --> 45:50.720
 What do general anesthetic gases do?

45:50.720 --> 45:57.240
 And see, he formed the view that it's the microtubules that they affect.

45:57.240 --> 46:03.040
 And the details of why he formed that view is not, or they're clear to me, but there's

46:03.040 --> 46:05.800
 an interesting story he keeps talking about.

46:05.800 --> 46:13.800
 But I found this very exciting because I thought these structures, these little tubes which

46:13.800 --> 46:20.680
 inhabit pretty well all cells, it's not just neurons, apart from red blood cells, they

46:20.680 --> 46:24.080
 inhabit pretty well all the other cells in the body.

46:24.080 --> 46:25.440
 But they're not all the same kind.

46:25.440 --> 46:28.240
 You get different kinds of microtubules.

46:28.240 --> 46:35.000
 And the ones that excited me the most, this may still not be totally clear, but the ones

46:35.000 --> 46:39.480
 that excited me most were the ones, the only ones that I knew about at the time because

46:39.480 --> 46:44.320
 they were very, very symmetrical structures.

46:44.320 --> 46:49.280
 And I had reason to believe that these very symmetrical structures would be much better

46:49.280 --> 46:56.200
 at preserving a quantum state, quantum coherence, preserving the thing without, you just need

46:56.200 --> 47:01.240
 to preserve certain degrees of freedom without them leaking into the environment.

47:01.240 --> 47:03.000
 Once they leak into the environment, you're lost.

47:03.000 --> 47:11.240
 So you've got to preserve these quantum states at a level which the state reduction process

47:11.240 --> 47:18.360
 comes in, and that's where I think the non computability comes in, and it's the measurement

47:18.360 --> 47:20.960
 process in quantum mechanics, what's going on.

47:20.960 --> 47:25.360
 So something about the measurement process and what's going on, something about the structure

47:25.360 --> 47:30.560
 of the microtubules, your intuition says maybe there's something here, maybe this kind

47:30.560 --> 47:35.600
 of structure allows for the mystery of the quantum mechanics.

47:35.600 --> 47:40.760
 There was a much better chance, yes, it just struck me that partly it was the symmetry

47:40.760 --> 47:46.720
 because there is a feature of symmetry, you can preserve quantum coherence much better

47:46.720 --> 47:48.480
 with symmetrical structures.

47:48.480 --> 47:50.560
 There's a good reason for that.

47:50.560 --> 47:52.560
 And that impressed me a lot.

47:52.560 --> 47:56.000
 I didn't know the difference between the A lattice and B lattice at that time, which

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
 could be important.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.960
 No, that could be, which isn't talked about much.

48:00.960 --> 48:04.840
 But that's in some sense details, we're going to take a step back just to say in case people

48:04.840 --> 48:05.840
 are not familiar.

48:05.840 --> 48:16.680
 So this was called the orchestrated objective reduction idea or ORC ORR, which is a by

48:16.680 --> 48:21.280
 biological philosophy of mind that postulates that consciousness originates at the quantum

48:21.280 --> 48:22.360
 level inside neurons.

48:22.360 --> 48:26.720
 So that has to do with your search for where, where is it coming from?

48:26.720 --> 48:31.600
 So that's counter to the notion that consciousness may arise from the computation performed by

48:31.600 --> 48:32.600
 the synapses.

48:32.600 --> 48:41.560
 Yes, the key point, sometimes people say it's because it's quantum mechanical, it's not

48:41.560 --> 48:42.560
 just that.

48:42.560 --> 48:46.880
 You see, it's more outrageous than that, you see, this is one reason I think we're so far

48:46.880 --> 48:51.080
 off from it, because we don't even know the physics right.

48:51.080 --> 48:56.680
 You see, it's not just quantum mechanics, people say, oh, you know, quantum systems and biological

48:56.680 --> 48:57.680
 structures.

48:57.680 --> 49:04.680
 No, will you starting to see that some basic biological systems does depend on quantum?

49:04.680 --> 49:10.800
 I mean, look, in the first place, all of chemistry is quantum mechanics, people got used to that

49:10.800 --> 49:13.160
 so they don't count that.

49:13.160 --> 49:19.280
 So he said, let's not count quantum chemistry, we sort of got the hang of that, they think.

49:19.280 --> 49:25.520
 But you have quantum effects, which are not just chemical, in photosynthesis.

49:25.520 --> 49:30.360
 And this is one of the striking things in the last several years, that photosynthesis

49:30.360 --> 49:38.880
 seems to be a basically quantum process, which is not simply chemical, it's using quantum

49:38.880 --> 49:41.560
 mechanics in a very basic way.

49:41.560 --> 49:48.560
 So you can start saying, oh, well, with photosynthesis is based on quantum mechanics, why not behavior

49:48.560 --> 49:50.440
 of neurons and things like that?

49:50.440 --> 49:55.120
 Maybe there's something which is a bit like photosynthesis in that respect.

49:55.120 --> 50:00.760
 But what I'm saying is even more outrageous than that, because those things are talking

50:00.760 --> 50:03.800
 about conventional quantum mechanics.

50:03.800 --> 50:08.760
 Now my argument says that conventional quantum mechanics, if you're just following the Schrodinger

50:08.760 --> 50:13.360
 equation, that's still computable, so you've got to go beyond that.

50:13.360 --> 50:20.760
 So you've got to go to where quantum mechanics goes wrong, in a certain sense.

50:20.760 --> 50:25.960
 You have to be a little bit careful about that, because the way people do quantum mechanics

50:25.960 --> 50:32.920
 is a sort of mixture of two different processes.

50:32.920 --> 50:38.920
 One of them is the Schrodinger equation, which is an equation Schrodinger wrote down, and

50:38.920 --> 50:44.880
 it tells you how the state of a system evolves, and it evolves according to this equation,

50:44.880 --> 50:50.440
 completely deterministic, but it involves inter ridiculous situations.

50:50.440 --> 50:53.480
 And this was what Schrodinger was very much pointing out with his cat.

50:53.480 --> 50:59.920
 He said, you follow my equation, that's Schrodinger's equation, and you could say that you have

50:59.920 --> 51:04.360
 a cat, which is dead and alive at the same time.

51:04.360 --> 51:09.120
 That would be the evolution of the Schrodinger equation would lead to a state, which is the

51:09.120 --> 51:12.840
 cat being dead and alive at the same time.

51:12.840 --> 51:16.840
 And he's more or less saying, this is an absurdity.

51:16.840 --> 51:19.720
 People nowadays say, oh, Schrodinger said you can have a cat, which is dead, and that's

51:19.720 --> 51:20.720
 not that.

51:20.720 --> 51:23.560
 You see, he was saying, this is an absurdity.

51:23.560 --> 51:25.840
 There's something missing.

51:25.840 --> 51:30.360
 And that the reduction of the state, or the collapse of the wave function, or whatever

51:30.360 --> 51:34.880
 it is, is something which has to be understood.

51:34.880 --> 51:37.960
 It's not following the Schrodinger equation.

51:37.960 --> 51:42.000
 It's not the way we conventionally do quantum mechanics.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.840
 There's something more than that.

51:44.840 --> 51:52.440
 And it's easy to quote authority here, because Einstein, at least three of the greatest physicists

51:52.440 --> 51:59.360
 of 20th century, who were very fundamental in developing quantum mechanics, Einstein,

51:59.360 --> 52:03.680
 one of them, Schrodinger, another, Dirac, another.

52:03.680 --> 52:08.720
 You have to look carefully at Dirac's writing, because he didn't tend to say this out loud

52:08.720 --> 52:11.400
 very much, because he was very cautious about what he said.

52:11.400 --> 52:18.160
 You find the right place, and you see, he says quantum mechanics is a provisional theory.

52:18.160 --> 52:23.600
 We need something which explains the collapse of the wave function.

52:23.600 --> 52:27.960
 We need to go beyond the theory we have now.

52:27.960 --> 52:31.480
 I happen to be one of the kinds of people, there are many, there is a whole group of

52:31.480 --> 52:36.240
 people, they're all considered to be a bit, you know, a bit mavericks, who believe that

52:36.240 --> 52:39.080
 quantum mechanics needs to be modified.

52:39.080 --> 52:44.760
 There's a small minority of those people, which are already a minority, who think that

52:44.760 --> 52:48.880
 the way in which it's modified has to be with gravity.

52:48.880 --> 52:52.760
 And there is an even smaller minority of those people who think it's a particular way that

52:52.760 --> 52:55.240
 I think it is, you see.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.560
 So those are the quantum gravity folks, but what's what?

52:57.560 --> 53:02.760
 You see, quantum gravity is already not this, because when you say quantum gravity, what

53:02.760 --> 53:07.600
 you really mean is quantum mechanics applied to gravitational theory.

53:07.600 --> 53:14.320
 So you say, let's take this wonderful formalism of quantum mechanics and make gravity fit

53:14.320 --> 53:15.320
 into it.

53:15.320 --> 53:18.120
 So that is what quantum gravity is meant to be.

53:18.120 --> 53:23.080
 Now I'm saying, you've got to be more even handed, that gravity affects the structure

53:23.080 --> 53:27.840
 of quantum mechanics too, it's not just you quantize gravity, you've got to gravitize

53:27.840 --> 53:29.560
 quantum mechanics.

53:29.560 --> 53:31.240
 And it's a two way thing.

53:31.240 --> 53:35.000
 But then when do you even get started, so that you're saying that we have to figure

53:35.000 --> 53:37.400
 out a totally new idea isn't it?

53:37.400 --> 53:38.400
 Exactly.

53:38.400 --> 53:42.880
 No, you're stuck, you don't have a theory, that's the trouble.

53:42.880 --> 53:45.960
 So this is a big problem if you say, okay, well, what's the theory?

53:45.960 --> 53:46.960
 I don't know.

53:46.960 --> 53:51.920
 So maybe in the very early days sort of, it is in the very early days, but just making

53:51.920 --> 53:52.920
 this point.

53:52.920 --> 53:53.920
 Yes.

53:53.920 --> 53:58.640
 You see, Stuart Hammerhoff tends to be, oh, Penrose says that it's got to be a reduction

53:58.640 --> 53:59.640
 of the state and so on.

53:59.640 --> 54:00.640
 So let's use it.

54:00.640 --> 54:02.160
 The trouble is Penrose doesn't say that.

54:02.160 --> 54:05.560
 Penrose says, well, I think that.

54:05.560 --> 54:11.800
 We have no experiments as yet, which shows that there are experiments which are being

54:11.800 --> 54:15.840
 thought through and which I'm hoping will be performed.

54:15.840 --> 54:20.960
 There is an experiment which is being developed by Dirk Baumeester, who is known for a long

54:20.960 --> 54:28.080
 time, who shares his time between Leiden in the Netherlands and Santa Barbara in the US.

54:28.080 --> 54:35.280
 And he's been working on an experiment which could perhaps demonstrate that quantum mechanics,

54:35.280 --> 54:40.920
 as we now understand it, if you don't bring in the gravitational effects, it has to be

54:40.920 --> 54:42.960
 modified.

54:42.960 --> 54:49.560
 And then there's also experiments that are underway that kind of look at the microtubule

54:49.560 --> 54:53.920
 side of things to see if there's, in the biology, you could see something like that.

54:53.920 --> 54:58.960
 Could you briefly mention it, because that's really sort of one of the only experimental

54:58.960 --> 55:02.680
 attempts in the very early days of even thinking about caution.

55:02.680 --> 55:07.360
 I think there's a very serious area here, which is what Stuart Hammerhoff is doing, and

55:07.360 --> 55:09.160
 I think it's very important.

55:09.160 --> 55:13.400
 One of the few places that you can really get a bit of a handle on what consciousness

55:13.400 --> 55:17.160
 is, is what turns it off.

55:17.160 --> 55:21.800
 And when you're thinking about general anesthetics, it's very specific.

55:21.800 --> 55:24.360
 These things turn consciousness off.

55:24.360 --> 55:25.920
 What the hell do they do?

55:25.920 --> 55:33.200
 Well, Stuart and a number of people who work with him and others happen to believe that

55:33.200 --> 55:36.920
 the general anesthetics directly affect microtubules.

55:36.920 --> 55:38.640
 And there is some evidence for this.

55:38.640 --> 55:45.360
 I don't know how strong it is and how watertight the case is, but I think there is some evidence

55:45.360 --> 55:49.280
 pointing in that kind of direction.

55:49.280 --> 55:53.840
 It's not just an ordinary chemical process, there's something quite different about it.

55:53.840 --> 56:02.840
 And one of the main candidates is that these anesthetic gases do affect directly microtubules.

56:02.840 --> 56:07.200
 And how strong that evidence is, I wouldn't be in a position to say.

56:07.200 --> 56:10.120
 And I think there is fairly impressive evidence.

56:10.120 --> 56:12.760
 And the point is the experiments are being undertaken.

56:12.760 --> 56:13.760
 Yes.

56:13.760 --> 56:14.760
 I mean, that is experimental.

56:14.760 --> 56:20.760
 It's a very clear direction where you can think of experiments which could indicate

56:20.760 --> 56:26.240
 whether or not it's really microtubules, which the anesthetic gases directly affect.

56:26.240 --> 56:27.440
 That's really exciting.

56:27.440 --> 56:32.960
 One of the sad things is, as far as I'm from my outside perspective, is not many people

56:32.960 --> 56:34.560
 are working on this.

56:34.560 --> 56:39.400
 So there's a very, like with Stuart, it feels like there's very few people carrying the

56:39.400 --> 56:41.240
 flag forward on this.

56:41.240 --> 56:46.160
 I think it's not many in the sense it's a minority, but it's not zero anymore.

56:46.160 --> 56:51.760
 You see, when Stuart and I were originally taught by us, we were just us and a few of

56:51.760 --> 56:59.560
 our friends, there weren't many people taking it, but it's grown into one of the main viewpoints.

56:59.560 --> 57:08.160
 There might be about four or five or six different views that people hold, and it's one of them.

57:08.160 --> 57:13.520
 It's considered as one of the possible lines of thinking, yes.

57:13.520 --> 57:18.480
 You describe physics theories as falling into one of three categories, the superb, the useful

57:18.480 --> 57:19.480
 or the tentative.

57:19.480 --> 57:21.760
 I like those words.

57:21.760 --> 57:23.680
 It's a beautiful categorization.

57:23.680 --> 57:29.840
 Do you think we'll ever have a superb theory of intelligence and of consciousness?

57:29.840 --> 57:30.840
 We might.

57:30.840 --> 57:33.680
 We're a long way from it.

57:33.680 --> 57:40.080
 I don't think we're even in the tentative scale.

57:40.080 --> 57:42.240
 You don't think we've even entered the realm of tentative?

57:42.240 --> 57:43.240
 Probably not.

57:43.240 --> 57:44.240
 I think so.

57:44.240 --> 57:45.240
 Yeah, that's right.

57:45.240 --> 57:53.320
 When you see this so controversial, we don't have a clear view which is accepted by a majority.

57:53.320 --> 57:58.080
 You say, yeah, people, most views are computational in one form or another, they think it's some,

57:58.080 --> 58:06.600
 but it's not very clear because even the IIT people who think of them as computational,

58:06.600 --> 58:09.840
 but I've heard them say, no, consciousness is supposed to be not computational.

58:09.840 --> 58:12.920
 I say, well, if it's not coming, what in the hell is it?

58:12.920 --> 58:14.200
 What's going on?

58:14.200 --> 58:19.240
 What physical processes are going on which are that?

58:19.240 --> 58:21.800
 What does it mean for something to be computational then?

58:21.800 --> 58:31.720
 Well, there has to be a process which is, you see, it's very curious the way the history

58:31.720 --> 58:36.480
 has developed in quantum mechanics because very early on people thought there was something

58:36.480 --> 58:40.040
 to do with consciousness, but it was almost the other way around.

58:40.040 --> 58:44.360
 You see, you have to say the Schrodinger equation says all these different alternatives

58:44.360 --> 58:48.160
 happen all at once, and then when is it that only one of them happens?

58:48.160 --> 58:53.560
 Well, one of the views, which was quite commonly held by a few distinguished quantum physicists,

58:53.560 --> 58:59.240
 is when a conscious being looks at the system or becomes aware of it, and at that point

58:59.240 --> 59:02.000
 it becomes one or the other.

59:02.000 --> 59:07.120
 That's a role where consciousness is somehow actively reducing the state.

59:07.120 --> 59:09.840
 My view is almost the exact opposite of that.

59:09.840 --> 59:16.200
 It's the state reduces itself in some way, which some non computational way, which we

59:16.200 --> 59:22.480
 don't understand, we don't have a proper theory of, and that is the building block of

59:22.480 --> 59:24.480
 what consciousness is.

59:24.480 --> 59:26.240
 So consciousness is the other way around.

59:26.240 --> 59:32.600
 It depends on that choice which nature makes all the time when the state becomes one or

59:32.600 --> 59:36.160
 the other rather than the superposition of one and the other.

59:36.160 --> 59:41.160
 And when that happens, there is what we're saying now an element of proto consciousness

59:41.160 --> 59:43.320
 takes place.

59:43.320 --> 59:48.280
 Proto consciousness is, roughly speaking, the building block out of which actual consciousness

59:48.280 --> 59:50.120
 is constructed.

59:50.120 --> 59:55.640
 So you have these proto conscious elements, which are when the state decides to do one

59:55.640 --> 1:00:01.800
 thing or the other, and that's the thing which when organized together, that's the

1:00:01.800 --> 1:00:08.800
 OR part in ORCOR, but the ORC part, that's the OR part, at least one can see where we're

1:00:08.800 --> 1:00:14.760
 deriving as a theory, you can say it's the quantum choice of going this way or that way.

1:00:14.760 --> 1:00:19.640
 But the ORC part, which is the orchestration of this, is much more mysterious.

1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:26.880
 And how does the brain somehow orchestrate all these individual OR processes into a

1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:32.560
 genuine, genuine conscious experience?

1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:37.440
 And it might be something that's beautifully simple, but we're completely in the dark about.

1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:43.000
 Yeah, I think at the moment, that's the thing, we happily put the word ORC down there to

1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:49.240
 say orchestrated, but that's even more unclear what that really means.

1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:55.920
 Just like the word material orchestrated, who knows, and we've been dancing a little

1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:01.000
 bit between the word intelligence or understanding and consciousness.

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:06.160
 Do you kind of see those as sitting in the same space of mystery as with this space?

1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:14.240
 You see, I tend to say you have understanding and intelligence and awareness.

1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:21.160
 And somehow, understanding is in the middle of it, you see.

1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:28.560
 I like to say, could you say of an entity that is actually intelligent if it doesn't

1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:29.760
 have the quality of understanding?

1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:35.200
 You see, I'm using terms I don't even know how to define, but who cares, I'm just relating

1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:36.200
 to them.

1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:38.640
 They're somewhat poetic, so if I somehow understand them.

1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:39.640
 Yes.

1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:40.640
 That's right.

1:01:40.640 --> 1:01:41.640
 Exactly.

1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:42.640
 But they're not mathematical in nature.

1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:45.680
 Yes, you see, as a mathematician, I don't know how to define any of them, but at least

1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:47.480
 I can point to the connections.

1:01:47.480 --> 1:01:54.400
 So the idea is intelligence is something which I believe needs understanding, otherwise you

1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:56.520
 wouldn't say it's really intelligence.

1:01:56.520 --> 1:02:01.680
 And understanding needs awareness, otherwise you wouldn't really say it's understanding.

1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:08.480
 Do you say of an entity that understands something unless it's really aware of it, normal usage?

1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:13.880
 So there's a three sort of awareness, understanding, and intelligence.

1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:19.120
 And I just tend to concentrate on understanding because that's where I can say something.

1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:22.000
 And that's the girdle theorem, things like that.

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.800
 But what does it mean to be perceived the color blue or something?

1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:27.800
 I'm a foggiest.

1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:30.320
 That's a much more difficult question.

1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:34.120
 I mean, is it the same if I see a color blue and you see it?

1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:38.440
 If you're assembling with this condition, what does it call them?

1:02:38.440 --> 1:02:42.320
 Over your sign, like a sound to a color that kind of thing.

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:43.320
 Yeah, that's right.

1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:45.120
 You get colors and sounds mixed up.

1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:46.120
 And that sort of thing.

1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:49.280
 I mean, an interesting subject, I mean.

1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:53.120
 But from the physics perspective, from the fundamentals perspective, we don't.

1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:57.960
 I think we're way off having much understanding what's going on there.

1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:04.480
 In your 2010 book, Cycles of Time, you suggest that another universe may have existed before

1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:06.280
 the Big Bang.

1:03:06.280 --> 1:03:08.920
 Can you describe this idea?

1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:11.080
 First of all, what is the Big Bang?

1:03:11.080 --> 1:03:13.280
 Sounds like a funny word.

1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:17.080
 And what may have been there before it?

1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:18.080
 Yes.

1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:22.080
 Just as a matter of terminology, I don't like to call it another universe because when you

1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:25.560
 have another universe, you think of it kind of quite separate from us.

1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:28.160
 But these things, they're not separate.

1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:31.560
 Now, the Big Bang, conventional theory.

1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:36.160
 You see, I was actually brought up in the sense of when I started getting interested

1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:40.560
 in cosmology, there was a thing called the steady state model, which was sort of philosophically

1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:41.560
 very interesting.

1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:46.000
 And there wasn't a Big Bang in that theory, but somehow new material was created all the

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.400
 time in the form of hydrogen and the universe kept on expanding and expanding and expanding

1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:51.920
 and there was room for more hydrogen.

1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:55.000
 It was a rather philosophically nice picture.

1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:03.480
 It was disproved when the Big Bang, well, when I say the Big Bang, this was theoretically

1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:09.720
 discovered by people trying to solve Einstein's equations and apply it to cosmology.

1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:10.720
 Einstein didn't like the idea.

1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:16.040
 He liked a universe which was there all the time and he had a model which was there all

1:04:16.040 --> 1:04:17.040
 the time.

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:22.600
 But then there was this discovery, accidental discovery, very important discovery of this

1:04:22.600 --> 1:04:25.280
 microwave background.

1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:31.920
 And if there's the crackle on your television screen, which is already sensing this microwave

1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:36.440
 background, which is coming at us from all directions, and you can trace it back and

1:04:36.440 --> 1:04:42.040
 back and back and back, then it came from a very early stage of the universe, well,

1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:43.720
 it's part of the Big Bang theory.

1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:47.720
 The Big Bang theory was when people tried to solve Einstein's equations.

1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:51.960
 They really found you had to have this initial state where the universe, it was used to

1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:55.720
 be called the primordial atom and things like this.

1:04:55.720 --> 1:05:01.840
 This Friedman and Lemaitre, Friedman was a Russian, Lemaitre was a Belgian, and they

1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:08.920
 independently, well, basically Friedman first, and Lemaitre talked about the initial state,

1:05:08.920 --> 1:05:12.560
 which is a very, very concentrated initial state, which seemed to be the origin of the

1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:13.560
 universe.

1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:14.560
 Primordial atom.

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:16.960
 Primordial atom is what he called it, yes.

1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:17.960
 Beautiful term.

1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:21.920
 And then it became, well, Fred Hoyle used the term Big Bang in a kind of derogatory

1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:22.920
 sense.

1:05:22.920 --> 1:05:23.920
 He said, well, didn't he have that?

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:24.920
 Just like with the shorting of the cats, right?

1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:25.920
 Yes.

1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:31.800
 It sort of got picked up on, whereas it wasn't his intention originally, but then the evidence

1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:37.160
 piled up and piled up, and one of my friends I learned a lot from, and when I was in Cambridge

1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:41.920
 with Dennis Sharma, he was a very proponent of steady state, and then he got converted

1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:44.520
 and said, no, I'm sorry, I had a great respect for him.

1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:46.880
 He went around lecturing and said, I was wrong.

1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:49.040
 This steady state model doesn't work.

1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:54.400
 There was this Big Bang, and this microwave background that you see, okay, it's not actually

1:05:54.400 --> 1:05:56.760
 quite the Big Bang, when I said not quite.

1:05:56.760 --> 1:06:01.560
 It's about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, but that's what you see.

1:06:01.560 --> 1:06:05.920
 But then you have to have had this Big Bang before it in order to make the equations work,

1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:11.120
 and it works beautifully, except for one little thing, which is this thing called inflation,

1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:14.200
 which people had to put into it to make it work.

1:06:14.200 --> 1:06:17.000
 When I first heard of it, I didn't like it at all.

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:18.000
 What's inflation?

1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:22.840
 Inflation is it in the first, I'm going to give you a very tiny number.

1:06:22.840 --> 1:06:23.840
 Think of a second.

1:06:23.840 --> 1:06:24.840
 That's not very long.

1:06:24.840 --> 1:06:29.520
 Now, I'm going to give you a fraction of a second, one over a number.

1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:39.360
 This number has 32 digits between, well, let's say between 36 and 32 digits, tiny, tiny time

1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:44.520
 between those two, tiny, ridiculous seconds, fraction of a second.

1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:49.760
 The universe was supposed to have expanded in this exponential way, an enormous way.

1:06:49.760 --> 1:06:54.640
 For no apparent reason, you had to invent a particular thing called the inflaton field

1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:58.280
 to make it do it, and I thought this is completely crazy.

1:06:58.280 --> 1:07:02.040
 There are reasons why people stuck with this idea.

1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:06.520
 You see, the thing is that I've formed my model for reasons which are very fundamental,

1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:12.080
 if you like, it has to do this very fundamental principle, which is known as the second law

1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:13.080
 of thermodynamics.

1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:17.720
 The second law of thermodynamics says, more or less, things get more and more random as

1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:19.200
 time goes on.

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:24.360
 Now, another way of saying exactly the same thing is things get less and less random as

1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:25.360
 things go back.

1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:27.560
 As you go back in time, they get less and less random.

1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:31.880
 So you go back and back and back and back, and the earliest thing you can directly see

1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:34.760
 is this microwave background.

1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:39.280
 What's one of the most striking features of it is that it's random.

1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:48.040
 It has what you call this spectrum, which is what's called the Planck spectrum, of frequencies,

1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:51.880
 different intensities for different frequencies, and there's this wonderful curve, there's

1:07:51.880 --> 1:07:54.720
 a max Planck, and what's it telling you?

1:07:54.720 --> 1:08:00.040
 It's telling you that the entropy is at a maximum, start is off at a maximum, and it's

1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:02.040
 going up over since.

1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:05.400
 I call that the mammoth in the room, I mean, it's a paradox.

1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:07.160
 The mammoth, yes, it is.

1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:10.560
 And so people, why don't cosmologists worry about this?

1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:16.680
 So I worried about it, and then I thought, well, it's not really a paradox because you're

1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:20.800
 looking at matter and radiation at a maximum entropy state.

1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:25.480
 What you're not seeing directly in that is the gravitation.

1:08:25.480 --> 1:08:28.560
 It's gravitation, which is not thermalized.

1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:34.560
 The gravitation was very, very low entropy, and it's low entropy by the uniformity, and

1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:36.040
 you see that in the microwave too.

1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:38.200
 It's very uniform over the whole sky.

1:08:38.200 --> 1:08:40.880
 I'm compressing a long story into a very short few sentences.

1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:42.120
 And doing a great job, yeah.

1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:45.880
 So what I'm saying is that there's a huge puzzle.

1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:53.680
 Why was gravity in this very low entropy state, very high organized state, everything

1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:59.040
 else was all random, and that, to me, was the biggest problem in cosmology.

1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:02.560
 The biggest problem, nobody seems to even worry about it.

1:09:02.560 --> 1:09:05.560
 People say they solved all the problems and they don't even worry about it.

1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:12.440
 They think inflation sources, it doesn't, it can't, because it's just...

1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:18.800
 Just to clarify, that was your problem with the inflation describing some aspect of the

1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:20.960
 moment right after the Big Bang?

1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:24.040
 Expansion is supposed to stretch it out and make it all uniform, you see.

1:09:24.040 --> 1:09:27.960
 It doesn't do it, because it can only do it if it's uniform already at the beginning.

1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:31.960
 You just have to look, I can't go into the details, but it doesn't solve it, and it was

1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:33.960
 completely clear to me it doesn't solve it.

1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:39.680
 But where does the conformal cyclic cosmology of starting to talk about something before

1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:40.680
 that singularity?

1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:47.760
 Well, I began, I was just thinking to myself, how boring this universe is going to be.

1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:56.960
 We got this exponential expansion, this was discovered early in this 21st century.

1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:03.960
 People discovered that these supernova exploding stars showed that the universe is actually

1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:07.560
 undergoing this exponential expansion.

1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:10.920
 So it's a self similar expansion.

1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:17.000
 And it seems to be a feature of this term that Einstein introduced into his cosmology

1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.640
 for the wrong reason.

1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:20.680
 He wanted a universe that was static.

1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:24.480
 He put this new term into his cosmology to make it make sense.

1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:26.720
 It's called the cosmological constant.

1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:31.360
 And then when he got convinced that the universe had a Big Bang, he retracted it, complaining

1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:33.360
 that this was his greatest blunder.

1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:38.040
 The trouble is it wasn't a blunder, it was actually right, very ironic.

1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:42.000
 And so the universe seems to be behaving with this cosmological constant.

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:43.000
 Okay.

1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.240
 So this universe is expanding and expanding.

1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:46.760
 What's going to happen in the future?

1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:48.920
 Well, it gets more and more boring for a while.

1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:50.640
 What's the most interesting thing in the universe?

1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:51.880
 Well, there's black holes.

1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:55.880
 The black holes more or less gulp down in entire clusters of galaxies.

1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:59.120
 It'll swallow up most of our galaxy.

1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:01.520
 We will run into our Andromeda galaxy's black hole.

1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:05.740
 That black hole will swallow our one, they'll get bigger and bigger, and they'll basically

1:11:05.740 --> 1:11:09.240
 swallow up the whole cluster of galaxies.

1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:11.360
 Gulp it all down pretty well all.

1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:13.160
 Most of it, maybe not all.

1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:14.160
 Most of it.

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:18.400
 They'll be just these black holes or I'm pretty boring, but still not as boring as

1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:19.400
 it's going to get.

1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:23.160
 It's going to get more boring because these black holes, you wait, you wait, and you wait,

1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:26.420
 and you wait, and you wait, and unbelievable length of time.

1:11:26.420 --> 1:11:30.080
 And Hawking's black hole evaporation starts to come in.

1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:34.820
 And the black holes, you just, it's a clenum riteidus.

1:11:34.820 --> 1:11:36.440
 Finally evaporate away.

1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:37.440
 Each one goes away.

1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:39.760
 It disappears with a pop at the end.

1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:40.760
 What could be more boring?

1:11:40.760 --> 1:11:45.560
 it was boring then. Now this is really boring. There's nothing, not even black holes.

1:11:46.360 --> 1:11:49.160
 The universe gets colder and colder and colder and colder. And I thought,

1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:57.480
 this is very, very boring. Now that's not science, is it? But it's emotional. So I thought, who's

1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:02.920
 going to be bored by this universe? Not us, we won't be around. It'll be mostly photons running

1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:08.600
 around. And what do photons do? They don't get bored because it's part of relativity, you see.

1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:13.880
 It's not really that they don't experience anything. That's not the point. The photons get

1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:20.760
 right out to infinity without experience any time. It's the way for where relativity works.

1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:24.440
 And this was part of what I used to do in my old days when I was looking at gravitational

1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:30.200
 radiation and how things behaved in infinity. Infinity is just like another place. You can

1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:36.280
 squash it down. As long as you don't have any mass in the world, infinity is just another place.

1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:42.360
 The photons get there. The gravitons get there. What do they get? They run to infinity. They say,

1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:47.240
 well, now I'm here, what do I do? There's something on the other side, is there? The usual view,

1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:50.680
 it's just a mathematical notion. There's nothing on the other side. That's just the boundary of it.

1:12:51.560 --> 1:12:57.400
 A nice example is this beautiful series of pictures by the Dutch artist MC Escher. You may

1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:02.280
 know them. The one's called Circle Limits. They're a very famous one with the angels and the devils.

1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:07.320
 And you can see them crowding and crowding and crowding up to the edge. Now, the kind of geometry

1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:13.960
 that these angels and devils inhabit, that's their infinity. But from our perspective,

1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:22.680
 infinity is just a place. Can you just take a brief pause and just the word you're saying,

1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:31.000
 infinity is just a place. For the most part, infinity is a mathematical concept.

1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.480
 I think this is one of the things. You think there's an actual physical

1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:39.960
 manifesto. In which way does infinity ever manifest itself in our physical universe?

1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:44.520
 Well, it does in various places. It's a thing that, if you're not a mathematician, you think,

1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:48.520
 oh, infinity, I can't think about that. Mathematicians think about infinity all the time.

1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:52.200
 They get used to the idea, and they just play around with different kinds of infinities,

1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:58.360
 and it becomes no problem. But you just have to take my word for it. Now, one of the things is,

1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:03.720
 you see, you take a Euclidean geometry. Well, it just keeps on going, and it goes out to infinity.

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:09.560
 Now, there's other kinds of geometry, and this is what's called hyperbolic geometry. It's a bit

1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:13.960
 like Euclidean geometry. It's a little bit different. It's like what Asher was trying to

1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:21.480
 describe in his angels and devils. And he learned about this from Coxeter. And he

1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:26.600
 think that's a very nice thing. I try and represent this infinity to this kind of geometry.

1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:30.520
 So it's not quite Euclidean geometry. It's a bit like it, that the angels and the devils

1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:37.560
 inhabit. And their infinity, by this nice transformation, you squash their infinity down

1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:45.080
 so you can draw it as this nice circle boundary to their universe. Now, from our outside perspective,

1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:52.120
 we can see their infinity as this boundary. Now, what I'm saying is that it's very like that.

1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:57.960
 The infinity that we might experience like those angels and devils in their world

1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:05.720
 can be thought of as a boundary. Now, I found this a very useful way of talking about

1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:12.360
 radiation, gravitational radiation, and things like that. It was a trick, mathematical trick.

1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:19.080
 So now what I'm saying is that that mathematical trick becomes real, that somehow the photons,

1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:26.680
 they need to go somewhere. Because from their perspective, infinity is just another place.

1:15:26.680 --> 1:15:33.240
 Now, this is a difficult idea to get your mind around. So that's why one of the reasons

1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:39.000
 cosmologists are finding a lot of trouble taking me seriously. But to me, it's not such a wild

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:44.520
 idea. What's on the other side of that infinity? You have to think, why am I allowed to think of

1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:53.400
 this? Because photons don't have any mass. And we in physics have beautiful ways of measuring time.

1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:59.720
 They're incredibly precise clocks, atomic and nuclear clocks, unbelievably precise. Why are

1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:05.880
 they so precise? Because of the two most famous equations of 20th century physics.

1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:13.640
 One of them is Einstein's E equals MC squared. What's that tell us? Energy and mass are equivalent.

1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:21.720
 The other one is even older than that. Still 20th century, only just. Max Planck E equals H nu.

1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:30.360
 Nu is a frequency. H is a constant again, like C. E is energy. Energy and frequency are equivalent.

1:16:30.360 --> 1:16:35.800
 Put the two together. Energy and mass are equivalent. Einstein, energy and frequency are

1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:42.440
 equivalent. Max Planck, put the two together. Mass and frequency are equivalent. Absolutely basic

1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:49.880
 physical principle. If you have a massive entity, a massive particle, it is a clock with a very,

1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:55.960
 very precise frequency. It's not, you can't directly use it. You have to scale it down,

1:16:55.960 --> 1:17:00.200
 so your atomic and nuclear clocks. But that's the basic principle. You scale it down to some

1:17:00.200 --> 1:17:05.960
 that you can actually perceive. But it's the same principle. If you have mass, you have beautiful

1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:13.560
 clocks. But the other side of that coin is, if you don't have mass, you don't have clocks.

1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:19.000
 If you don't have clocks, you don't have rulers. You don't have scale.

1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:24.360
 So you don't have space and time. You don't have a measure of the scale of space and time.

1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:31.000
 So you have to, you do have the structure, what's called the conformal structure. You see,

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:35.960
 it's what the angels and devils have. If you look at the eye of the devil, no matter how close to

1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:41.720
 the boundary it is, it has the same shape, but it has a different size. So you can scale up and

1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:48.360
 you can scale down, but you mustn't change the shape. So it's basically the same idea,

1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:54.280
 but applied to space time now. In the very remote future, you have things which don't measure the

1:17:54.280 --> 1:18:00.360
 scale, but the shape, if you like, is still there. Now that's in the remote future. Now I'm going to

1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:05.880
 do the exact opposite. Now I'm going to go way back into the Big Bang. Now as you get there,

1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:13.880
 things go hotter and hotter, denser and denser. What's the universe dominated by? Particles moving

1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:19.240
 around almost with the speed of light. When they get almost with the speed of light, okay,

1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:25.720
 they begin to lose the mass too. So for a completely opposite reason, they lose the sense of scale as

1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:33.320
 well. So my crazy idea is the Big Bang and the remote future, they seem completely different.

1:18:33.320 --> 1:18:39.000
 One is extremely dense, extremely hot. The other is very, very rarefied and very, very cold,

1:18:39.560 --> 1:18:45.000
 but if you squash one down by this conformal scaling, you get the other. So although they

1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:52.600
 look and feel very different, they're really almost the same. The remote future on the other

1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:56.920
 side, and claiming as that, where do the photons go? They go into the next Big Bang.

1:18:58.440 --> 1:19:03.720
 You've got to get your mind around that crazy idea. Taking a step on the other side of the place that

1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:10.200
 is infinity. Okay. So I'm saying the other side of our Big Bang, now I'm going back into the Big

1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:17.480
 Bang, there was the remote future of a previous Eon. And what I'm saying is that previous Eon,

1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:24.200
 there are signals coming through to us, which we can see and which we do see. And these are

1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:31.240
 both signals, the two main signals are to do with black holes. One of them is the collisions

1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:36.920
 between black holes. And as they spiral into each other, they release a lot of energy in

1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:43.480
 the form of gravitational waves. Those gravitational waves get through in a certain form into the next

1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:49.480
 Eon. That's fascinating that there's some, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but that means

1:19:49.480 --> 1:20:00.520
 that some information can travel from another Eon. Exactly. That is fascinating. I've seen

1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:07.320
 somewhere described sort of the discussion of the Fermi paradox, that if there's intelligent life,

1:20:08.120 --> 1:20:15.960
 yes, communication immediately takes you there. We have a paper, my colleague,

1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:21.160
 Vaheguzha Jan, who I've worked with on these ideas for a while, we have a crazy paper on that,

1:20:21.160 --> 1:20:26.440
 yes, looking at the Fermi paradox, yes. Right. So if the universe is just cycling over and over

1:20:26.440 --> 1:20:35.880
 and over, punctuated by the singularity of the Big Bang, and then intelligent or any kind of

1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:42.600
 intelligent systems can communicate through from Eon to Eon, why haven't we heard anything from

1:20:42.600 --> 1:20:49.000
 our alien friends? Because we don't know how to look. That's fundamentally the reason. I don't

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:55.240
 know, you see, it's speculation. I mean, the SETI program is a reasonable thing to do,

1:20:55.240 --> 1:21:02.840
 but still speculation. It's trying to say, okay, maybe not too far away with a civilization which

1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:09.720
 got there first, before us, early enough that they could send us signals, but how far away would you

1:21:09.720 --> 1:21:14.920
 need to go before? I mean, I don't know. We have so little knowledge about that. We haven't seen

1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:20.040
 any signals yet, but it's worth looking. It's worth looking. And what I'm trying to say, here's another

1:21:20.040 --> 1:21:25.320
 possible place where you might look. Now, you're not looking at civilizations which got there first.

1:21:26.040 --> 1:21:31.240
 You're looking at those civilizations which were so successful, probably a lot more successful than

1:21:31.240 --> 1:21:37.880
 there were likely to be by the looks of things, which knew how to handle their own global warming

1:21:37.880 --> 1:21:44.600
 or whatever it is, and to get through it all and to live to a ripe old age in the sense of a civilization

1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:51.560
 to the extent that they could harness signals, that they could propagate through for some reason

1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:58.680
 of their own desires, whatever we wouldn't know, to other civilizations which might be able to pick

1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:02.840
 up the signals. But what kind of signals would they be? I am a foggiest.

1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:11.240
 Let me ask the question. What do you use the most beautiful idea in physics or mathematics or the

1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:16.760
 art at the intersection of the two? I'm going to have to say complex analysis.

1:22:18.360 --> 1:22:23.720
 I might have said infinities. One of the most single most beautiful idea, I think, was the fact

1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:30.200
 that you can have infinities of different sizes and so on. But that's, in a way, I think, complex

1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:40.280
 analysis. It's got so much magic in it. It's a very simple idea. You take numbers, you take

1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:45.160
 the integers and then you fill them up into the fractions and the real numbers. You imagine you're

1:22:45.160 --> 1:22:50.600
 trying to measure a continuous line and then you think of how you can solve equations. Then what

1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:57.640
 about x squared equals minus one? Well, there's no real number which has satisfied that. So you

1:22:57.640 --> 1:23:03.480
 have to think of, well, there's a number called i. You think you invent it. Well, in a certain sense,

1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:08.600
 it's there already. But this number, when you add that square root of minus one to it, you have

1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:15.080
 what's called the complex numbers. And they're an incredible system. If you like, you put one little

1:23:15.080 --> 1:23:21.160
 thing in, you put square root of minus one in and you get how much benefit out of it, all sorts of

1:23:21.160 --> 1:23:28.360
 things that you'd never imagined before. And it's that amazing, all hiding there in putting that

1:23:28.360 --> 1:23:32.600
 square root of minus one in. So in a sense, I think that's the most magical thing I've seen in

1:23:32.600 --> 1:23:36.680
 mathematics or physics. And it's in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics. You see, it's

1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:40.920
 there already. You might think, what's it doing there? Okay, just a nice beautiful piece of

1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:47.080
 mathematics. And then suddenly we see, nope, it's the very crucial basis of quantum mechanics.

1:23:47.080 --> 1:23:51.800
 It's there in the way the world works. So on the question of whether math is discovered or

1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:57.000
 invented, it sounds like you may be suggesting that partially it's possible that math is indeed

1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:02.280
 discovered. Oh, absolutely. Yes. No, it's more like archaeology than you might think. Yes.

1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:10.920
 Yes. So let me ask the most ridiculous, maybe the most important question. What is the meaning of

1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:16.680
 life? What gives your life fulfillment, purpose, happiness and meaning? Why do you think we're

1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:21.480
 here on this? Given all the big bang in the infinities of photons that we've talked about?

1:24:21.480 --> 1:24:28.360
 All I would say, I think it's not a stupid question. I mean, there are some people, you know, many of

1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:32.440
 my colleagues, new scientists, and they say, well, that's a stupid question, meaning we're just here

1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:39.560
 because things came together and produced life and so what. I think there's more to it. But what

1:24:39.560 --> 1:24:44.600
 there is, that's more to it. I have really much idea. And it might be somehow connected to the

1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:50.040
 mechanisms of consciousness that we've been talking about, the mystery there. Yeah. It's connected

1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:55.560
 with all sorts of, yeah, I think these things are tied up in ways which, you see, I tend to think

1:24:55.560 --> 1:25:01.480
 the mystery of consciousness is tied up with the mystery of quantum mechanics and how it

1:25:02.200 --> 1:25:07.080
 fits in with the classical world. And that's all to do with the mystery of complex numbers.

1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:15.080
 And there are mysteries there, which look like mathematical mysteries, but they seem to have

1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:21.160
 a bearing on the way the physical world operates. We're scratching the surface. We have a long,

1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:28.040
 long, huge way to go before we really understand that. And it's a beautiful idea that the depth,

1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:32.840
 the mathematical depth could be discovered. And then there's tragedies of ghettos and

1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:37.640
 completeness along the way that we'll have to somehow figure our ways around. Yeah.

1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:43.240
 So, Roger, it was a huge honor to talk to you. Thank you so much for your time today.

1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:19.080
 And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom that Roger Penrose wrote in his book,

1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:25.640
 The Emperor's New Mind. Beneath all this technicality is the feeling that it is indeed,

1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:31.800
 quote unquote, obvious, that the conscious mind cannot work like a computer, even though much

1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:37.960
 of what is involved in mental activity might do so. This is the kind of obviousness that a child

1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:44.600
 can see, though the child may later in life become browbeaten into believing that the obvious problems

1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:51.000
 are quote unquote, non problems to be argued into nonexistence by careful reasoning and

1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:58.040
 clever choices of definition. Children sometimes see things clearly that are obscured in later life.

1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:03.880
 We often forget the wonder that we felt as children when the cares of the quote unquote

1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:10.280
 real world have begun to settle on our shoulders. Children are not afraid to pose basic questions

1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:15.560
 that may embarrass us as adults to ask. What happens to each of our streams of consciousness

1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:22.120
 after we die? Where was it before we were born? Might we become or have been someone else?

1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:29.080
 Why do we perceive it all? Why are we here? Why is there a universe here at all in which we can

1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:35.240
 actually be? These are puzzles that tend to come with the awakenings of awareness in any of us,

1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:41.880
 and no doubt with the awakening of self awareness within whichever creature or

1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:59.560
 other entity it first came. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
