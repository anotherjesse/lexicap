00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
 The following is a conversation with S. James Gates, Jr.

00:03.840 --> 00:07.320
 He's a theoretical physicist and professor at Brown University,

00:07.320 --> 00:11.480
 working on supersymmetry, supergravity, and super strength theory.

00:11.480 --> 00:16.520
 He served on former President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology,

00:16.520 --> 00:21.600
 and he's now the coauthor of a new book titled Proving Einstein Right

00:21.600 --> 00:26.520
 about the scientists who set out to prove Einstein's theory of relativity.

00:26.520 --> 00:30.240
 You may have noticed that I've been speaking with not just computer scientists,

00:30.240 --> 00:35.200
 but philosophers, mathematicians, physicists, economists, and soon much more.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.360
 To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning, bigger than computing.

00:39.360 --> 00:43.080
 It is our civilization's journey into understanding the human mind

00:43.080 --> 00:45.760
 and creating echoes of it in the machine.

00:45.760 --> 00:50.360
 That journey includes, of course, the world of theoretical physics

00:50.360 --> 00:53.360
 and its practice of first principles mathematical thinking

00:53.360 --> 00:57.520
 and exploring the fundamental nature of our reality.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.560
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.680
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on Apple Podcasts,

01:04.680 --> 01:09.400
 follow on Spotify, support on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,

01:09.400 --> 01:13.480
 at Lex Freedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:13.480 --> 01:17.160
 If you leave a review on Apple Podcasts or YouTube or Twitter,

01:17.160 --> 01:20.600
 consider measuring ideas, people, topics you find interesting.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.160
 It helps guide the future of this podcast.

01:23.160 --> 01:28.720
 But in general, I just love comments that are full of kindness and thoughtfulness in them.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.840
 This podcast is a side project for me, but I still put a lot of effort into it.

01:32.840 --> 01:39.760
 So the positive words of support from an amazing community, from you, really help.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.520
 I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.120
 I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode

01:45.120 --> 01:48.960
 and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.680
 I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.320
 I provide timestamps for the start of the conversations

01:55.320 --> 01:57.880
 you may have noticed that you can skip to,

01:57.880 --> 02:01.640
 but it helps if you listen to the ad and support this podcast

02:01.640 --> 02:05.320
 by trying out the product, the service being advertised.

02:05.320 --> 02:10.120
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.520
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

02:12.520 --> 02:16.840
 but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.760
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

02:19.760 --> 02:25.240
 You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.

02:25.240 --> 02:28.080
 Broker's services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:28.080 --> 02:31.120
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.080
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

02:33.080 --> 02:36.200
 to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,

02:36.200 --> 02:39.600
 best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.080
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

02:43.080 --> 02:47.280
 in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,

02:47.280 --> 02:51.120
 which means the donated money is used to maximum effectiveness.

02:51.120 --> 02:56.440
 When you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play, and use code LEX Podcast,

02:56.440 --> 03:00.520
 you'll get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

03:00.520 --> 03:05.400
 which again is an organization that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys

03:05.400 --> 03:08.360
 to dream of engineering a better world.

03:08.360 --> 03:13.560
 And now, here's my conversation with S. James Gates Jr.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.480
 You tell a story when you were eight.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.160
 You had a profound realization that the stars in the sky

03:18.160 --> 03:22.520
 are actually places that we could travel to one day.

03:22.520 --> 03:27.200
 Do you think human beings will ever venture outside of our solar system?

03:27.200 --> 03:30.520
 Wow, the question of whether humanity gets outside of the solar system,

03:30.520 --> 03:31.760
 it's going to be a challenge.

03:31.760 --> 03:38.320
 And as long as the laws of physics that we have today are accurate and valid,

03:38.320 --> 03:40.840
 it's going to be extraordinarily difficult.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.440
 I'm a science fiction fan, as you probably know,

03:43.440 --> 03:48.200
 so I love to dream of starships and traveling to other solar systems,

03:48.200 --> 03:52.560
 but the barriers are just formidable.

03:52.560 --> 03:55.400
 If we just kind of venture a little bit into science fiction,

03:55.400 --> 03:58.240
 do you think the spaceships, if we are successful,

03:58.240 --> 04:03.120
 that take us outside the solar system will look like the ones we have today?

04:03.120 --> 04:07.520
 Or do fundamental breakthroughs, are fundamental breakthroughs necessary?

04:07.520 --> 04:10.200
 In order to have genuine starships,

04:10.200 --> 04:14.840
 probably some really radical views about the way the universe works

04:14.840 --> 04:18.000
 are going to have to take place in our science.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.360
 We could, with our current technology,

04:22.360 --> 04:25.600
 think about constructing multigenerational starships

04:25.600 --> 04:31.240
 where the people who get on them are not the people who get off at the other end.

04:31.240 --> 04:36.600
 But even if we do that, the formal problems, actually our bodies,

04:36.600 --> 04:41.200
 which doesn't seem to be conscious for a lot of people,

04:41.200 --> 04:44.040
 even getting to Mars is going to present this challenge,

04:44.040 --> 04:47.400
 because we live in this wonderful home,

04:47.400 --> 04:50.760
 has a protective magnetosphere around it,

04:50.760 --> 04:54.120
 and so we're shielded from cosmic radiation.

04:54.120 --> 04:58.840
 Once you leave the shield, there are some estimates that,

04:58.840 --> 05:03.120
 for example, if you sent someone to Mars with that technology,

05:03.120 --> 05:05.720
 probably about two years out there without the shield,

05:05.720 --> 05:07.000
 they're going to be bombarded.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.200
 That means radiation, probably means cancer.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.920
 So that's one of the most formal challenges,

05:12.920 --> 05:16.280
 even if we could get over the technology.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.320
 Do you think so Mars is a harsh place?

05:19.320 --> 05:23.240
 Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other folks, NASA,

05:23.240 --> 05:25.920
 are really pushing to put a human being on Mars.

05:25.920 --> 05:31.280
 Do you think, again, let's forgive me for lingering in science fiction land for a little bit,

05:31.280 --> 05:34.400
 do you think one day we may be able to colonize Mars?

05:34.400 --> 05:37.800
 First, do you think we'll put a human on Mars,

05:37.800 --> 05:40.720
 and then do you think we'll put many humans on Mars?

05:40.720 --> 05:45.480
 So first of all, I am extraordinarily convinced

05:45.480 --> 05:48.120
 we will not put a human on Mars by 2030,

05:48.120 --> 05:52.080
 which is a date that you often hear in the public debate.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.480
 What's the challenge there?

05:53.480 --> 05:54.200
 What do you think?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.600
 So there are a couple of ways that I could slice this,

05:56.600 --> 06:00.920
 but the one that I think is simplest for people to understand involves money.

06:00.920 --> 06:05.440
 So you look at how we got to the moon in the 1960s.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.280
 It was about 10 year duration between the challenge

06:08.280 --> 06:12.680
 that President Kennedy laid out and our successfully landing a moon.

06:12.680 --> 06:16.520
 I was actually here at MIT when that first moon landing occurred,

06:16.520 --> 06:18.240
 so I remember watching it on TV.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.160
 But how did we get there?

06:19.160 --> 06:26.880
 Well, we had this extraordinary technical agency of the United States government, NASA.

06:26.880 --> 06:32.680
 It consumed about 5% of the country's economic output.

06:32.680 --> 06:40.440
 And so you say 5% of the economic output over about a 10 year period gets us 250,000 miles in space.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.520
 Mars is about 100 times farther.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.520
 So you have at least 100 times the challenge,

06:45.520 --> 06:50.840
 and we're spending about one tenth of the funds that we spent then as a government.

06:50.840 --> 06:55.720
 So my claim is that it's at least a thousand times harder for me to imagine

06:55.720 --> 06:58.000
 us getting to Mars by 2030.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.840
 And he had that part that you mentioned in the speech that I just have to throw in there of JFK,

07:03.840 --> 07:07.640
 of we do these things not because they're easy, but because they're hard.

07:07.640 --> 07:11.840
 That's such a beautiful line that I would love to hear a modern president say

07:11.840 --> 07:13.680
 about a scientific endeavor.

07:13.680 --> 07:19.560
 Well, one day we live in hope that such a president will arise for our nation.

07:19.560 --> 07:27.120
 But even if, like I said, even if you fix the technical problems, the biological engineering

07:27.120 --> 07:28.920
 that I worry most about.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.920
 However, I'm going to go out on a limb here.

07:31.920 --> 07:44.000
 I think that by 2090 or so, or 2100, so to say, 120, I suspect we're going to have a human on Mars.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
 Wow, so you think that many years out, first a few tangents.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.440
 You said bioengineering is a challenge.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.320
 What's the challenge there?

07:52.320 --> 08:00.720
 So as I said, the real problem with interstellar travel, aside from the technology challenges,

08:00.720 --> 08:03.160
 the real problem is radiation.

08:03.160 --> 08:12.840
 And how do you engineer either an environment or a body because we see rapid advances going on in bioengineering?

08:12.840 --> 08:21.480
 How do you engineer either a ship or body so that something, some person that's recognizably human

08:21.480 --> 08:24.560
 will survive the rigors of interplanetary space travel?

08:24.560 --> 08:29.480
 It's much more difficult than most people seem to take into account.

08:29.480 --> 08:40.960
 So if we could look on the 2090, 2100, 2120 sort of thinking of that kind of, you know,

08:40.960 --> 08:43.600
 and let's look on money.

08:43.600 --> 08:50.640
 So Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are pushing the cost, trying to push the cost down.

08:50.640 --> 08:56.360
 I mean, this is, so do you have hope as this actually sort of a brilliant big picture scientist?

08:56.360 --> 09:04.880
 Do you think a business entrepreneur can take science and make it cheaper and get it out there faster?

09:04.880 --> 09:08.480
 So bending the cost curve, you'll notice that has been an anchor.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.040
 This is the simplest way for me to discuss this with people about what the challenge is.

09:12.040 --> 09:18.160
 So yes, bending the cost curve is certainly critical if we're going to be successful.

09:18.160 --> 09:25.280
 Now, you ask about the endeavors that are out there now, sponsored by two very prominent American citizens,

09:25.280 --> 09:28.000
 Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.160
 I'm disappointed actually in what I see in terms of the routes that are being pursued.

09:35.160 --> 09:39.560
 So let me give you one example there, and this one is going to be a little bit more technical.

09:39.560 --> 09:45.040
 So if you look at the kinds of rockets that both these organizations are creating,

09:45.040 --> 09:52.720
 yes, it's wonderful reusable technology to see a rocket go up and land on its fins just like it did in science fiction movies when I was a kid.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.400
 That's astounding.

09:54.400 --> 10:04.320
 But the real problem is those rockets, the technology that we're doing now is not really that different than what was used to go to the moon.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.520
 And there are alternatives, it turns out.

10:06.520 --> 10:13.160
 There's an engine called a flare engine, which so a traditional rocket, if you look at the engine, looks like a bell, right?

10:13.160 --> 10:14.880
 And then the flame comes out the bottom.

10:14.880 --> 10:22.160
 But there is a kind of engine called a flare engine, which is essentially when you look at it, it looks like.

10:22.160 --> 10:27.560
 An exhaust pipe on like a fancy car that's, you know, long and elongated.

10:27.560 --> 10:34.040
 And it's a type of rocket engine that we know we know it's there been preliminary testing, we know it works.

10:34.040 --> 10:44.240
 And it also is actually much more economical because what it does is allow you to vary the amount of thrust as you go up in a way that you cannot do with one of these bell shaped engines.

10:44.240 --> 10:56.600
 So you would think that an entrepreneur might try to have the breakthrough to use flare nozzles as they're called as a way to bend the cost curve.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.200
 Because as we keep coming back, that's going to be a big factor.

10:59.200 --> 11:06.200
 But that's not happening, in fact, what we see is what I think of as incremental change in terms of our technology.

11:06.200 --> 11:10.200
 So I'm not really very encouraged by what I personally see.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.520
 So incremental change won't bend the cost curve?

11:12.520 --> 11:14.160
 I don't see it.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.400
 Just linger on the sci fi for one more question.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.920
 Sure.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.920
 Do you think we're alone in the universe?

11:20.920 --> 11:23.760
 Are we the only intelligent form of life?

11:23.760 --> 11:30.320
 So there is a quote by Carl Sagan, which I really love when I hear this question.

11:30.320 --> 11:45.040
 And I recall the quote and it goes something like, if we're the only conscious life in the universe, it's a terrible waste of space because the universe is an incredibly big place.

11:45.040 --> 11:51.600
 And when Carl made that statement, we didn't know about the profusion of planets that are out there.

11:51.600 --> 12:04.200
 In the last decade, we've discovered over a thousand planets and a substantial number of those planets are Earth like in terms of being in the Goldilocks zone as it's called.

12:04.200 --> 12:13.480
 So it's in my mind, it's practically inconceivable that we're the only conscious form of life in the universe.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.920
 But that doesn't mean they've come to visit us.

12:15.920 --> 12:21.280
 Do you think they would look, do you think we'll recognize alien life if we saw it?

12:21.280 --> 12:26.200
 Do you think it would look anything like the carbon based biological system we have on Earth today?

12:26.200 --> 12:32.680
 It would depend on that life's native environment in which it arose.

12:32.680 --> 12:49.520
 If that environment was sufficiently like our environment, there's a principle in biology and nature called convergence, which is that even if you have two biological systems that are totally separated from each other, if they face similar conditions, nature tends to converge on solutions.

12:49.520 --> 12:57.920
 And so there might be similarities if this alien life form was born in a place that's kind of like this place.

12:57.920 --> 13:04.040
 Physics appears to be quite similar, the laws of physics across the entirety of the universe.

13:04.040 --> 13:10.400
 Do you think weirder things than we see on Earth can spring up out of the same kinds of laws of physics?

13:10.400 --> 13:12.920
 From the laws of physics, I would say yes.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.640
 First of all, if you look at carbon based life, why are we carbon based?

13:15.640 --> 13:26.720
 Well, it turns out it's because of the way that carbon interacts with elements, which in fact is also a reflection on the electronic structure of the carbon nucleus.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.480
 So you can look down the table of elements and say, well, gee, do we see similar elements?

13:30.480 --> 13:31.520
 The answer is yes.

13:31.520 --> 13:36.320
 And one that one often hears about in science fiction is silicon.

13:36.320 --> 13:40.320
 So maybe there's a silicon based life form out there if the conditions are right.

13:40.320 --> 13:50.320
 I think it's presumptuous of us to think that we are the template by which all life has to appear.

13:50.320 --> 13:55.360
 Before we dive into beautiful details, let me ask a big question.

13:55.360 --> 14:02.200
 What to you is the most beautiful idea, maybe the most surprising, mysterious idea in physics?

14:02.200 --> 14:05.880
 The most surprising idea to me is that we can actually do physics.

14:05.880 --> 14:27.680
 The universe did not have to be constructed in such a way that our with our limited intellectual capacity that is actually put together in such a way and that we are put together in such a way that we can, with our minds, I delve incredibly deeply into the structure of the universe.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.960
 That to me is pretty close to a miracle.

14:30.960 --> 14:40.080
 So there's simple equations, relatively simple, that can describe things, you know, the fundamental functions.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.720
 They can describe everything about our reality.

14:42.720 --> 14:50.680
 That's not, can you imagine universes where everything is a lot more complicated?

14:50.680 --> 14:57.560
 Do you think there's something inherent about universes that simple laws?

14:57.560 --> 15:08.160
 Well, first of all, let me, this is a question that I encounter in a number of guides is a lot of people will raise the question about whether mathematics is the language of the universe.

15:08.160 --> 15:14.920
 And my response is mathematics is the language that we humans are capable of using in describing the universe.

15:14.920 --> 15:20.840
 It may have little to do with the universe, but in terms of our capacity, it's the microscope.

15:20.840 --> 15:31.560
 It's the telescope through which we, it's the lens through which we are able to view the universe with the precision that no other human language allows.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.040
 So could there be other universes?

15:33.040 --> 15:37.000
 Well, I don't even know if this one looks like I think it does.

15:37.000 --> 15:50.320
 But the beautiful surprising thing is that physics, there are laws of physics, very few laws of physics that can effectively compress down the functioning of the universe.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.760
 Yes, that's extraordinarily surprising.

15:52.760 --> 15:56.920
 I like to use the analogy with computers and information technology.

15:56.920 --> 16:10.440
 If you worry about transmitting large bundles of data, one of the things that computer scientists do for us is they allow for processes that are called compression, where you take big packets of data and you press them down into much smaller packets.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.480
 And then you transmit those and then unpack them at the other end.

16:13.480 --> 16:18.600
 And so it looks a little bit to me like the universe has kind of done us a favor.

16:18.600 --> 16:29.680
 It's constructed our minds in such a way that we have this thing called mathematics, which then as we look at the universe, teaches us how to carry out the compression process.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.640
 A quick question about compression.

16:31.640 --> 16:35.160
 Do you think the human mind can be compressed?

16:35.160 --> 16:38.040
 The biology can be compressed.

16:38.040 --> 16:48.560
 We talked about space travel to be able to compress the information that captures some large percent of what it means to be me or you.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.560
 And then be able to send that at the speed of light.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.320
 Wow, that's a big question.

16:54.320 --> 16:58.840
 And let me try to take it apart, unpack it into several pieces.

16:58.840 --> 17:07.960
 I don't believe that wetware biology such as we are has an exclusive patent on an on intellectual consciousness.

17:07.960 --> 17:20.720
 I suspect that other structures in the universe are perfectly capable of producing the data streams that we use to process, first of all, our observations of the universe and an awareness of ourself.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.320
 I can imagine other structures can do that also.

17:23.320 --> 17:30.520
 So that's part of what you were talking about, which I would have some disagreement with.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.600
 Consciousness.

17:31.600 --> 17:31.800
 Yes.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.280
 What's the most interesting part of.

17:34.280 --> 17:38.000
 Consciousness of us humans is consciousness is the thing.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.920
 I think that's the most interesting thing about humans.

17:39.920 --> 17:45.040
 And then you're saying that there is other entities throughout the universe.

17:45.040 --> 17:45.760
 I could imagine.

17:45.760 --> 17:53.760
 I can well imagine that the architecture that supports our consciousness again has no patent on consciousness.

17:53.760 --> 18:04.080
 Just in case you have an interesting thought here, there's folks perhaps in philosophy called panpsychists that believe consciousness underlies everything.

18:04.080 --> 18:07.000
 It is one of the fundamental laws of the universe.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.680
 Do you have a sense that that could possibly fit into?

18:09.680 --> 18:12.000
 I don't know the answer to that question.

18:12.000 --> 18:20.200
 One part of that belief system is Gia, which is that there's a kind of conscious life force about our planet.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.800
 And, you know, I've encountered these things before.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.400
 I don't quite know what to make of them.

18:24.400 --> 18:39.960
 I my own life experience and I'll be 69 in about two months and I have spent all my adulthood thinking about the way that mathematics interacts with nature and with us to try to understand nature.

18:39.960 --> 18:48.600
 And all I can tell you from all of my integrated experience is that there is something extraordinarily mysterious to me about our universe.

18:48.600 --> 18:53.720
 This is something that Einstein said from his life experience as a scientist.

18:53.720 --> 19:03.360
 And this mysteriousness almost feels like the universe is our parent.

19:03.360 --> 19:14.880
 It's a very strange thing, perhaps to hear scientists say, but there are just so many strange coincidences that you just get a sense that something is going on.

19:14.880 --> 19:21.840
 Well, I interrupted you in terms of compressing what we're down to a consented at the speed of light.

19:21.840 --> 19:36.520
 Yes. So, so the first thing is I would argue that it's probably very likely that artificial intelligence ultimately will develop something like consciousness, something that for us will probably be indistinguishable from consciousness.

19:36.520 --> 19:47.360
 So that's what I meant by our biological processing equipment that we carry up here probably does not hold a patent on consciousness because it's really about the data streams.

19:47.360 --> 19:55.800
 I mean, that's as far as I can tell, that's what we are. We are self actuating, self learning data streams that to me is most accurate way.

19:55.800 --> 20:01.200
 I can tell you what I've seen in my lifetime about what humans are at the level of consciousness.

20:01.200 --> 20:06.600
 So if that's the case, then you just need to have an architecture that supports that information processing.

20:06.600 --> 20:17.160
 So let's assume that that's true, that that, in fact, what we call consciousness is really about a very peculiar kind of data stream.

20:17.160 --> 20:33.560
 If that's the case, then if you can export that to a piece of hardware, something metal, electronic, what have you, then you certainly will ultimately that kind of consciousness could get to Mars very quickly.

20:33.560 --> 20:41.280
 It doesn't have our problems. You can engineer the body as I say, there's a ship or a body you engineer one or both.

20:41.280 --> 20:49.680
 Send it at a speed of light. Well, that one is a more difficult one because that now goes beyond just a matter of having a data stream.

20:49.680 --> 20:53.040
 It's now the preservation of the information in the data stream.

20:53.040 --> 21:03.440
 And so unless you can build something that's like a super, super, super version of the way the internet works, because most people aren't aware that the internet itself is actually a miracle.

21:03.440 --> 21:14.880
 It's based on a technology called message packaging. So if you could exponentiate message packaging in some way to preserve the information that's in the data stream, then maybe your dream becomes true.

21:14.880 --> 21:39.240
 Can we, you mentioned with artificial intelligence, sort of us human beings not having a monopoly on consciousness. Does the idea of artificial intelligence systems, computational systems being able to basically replacing us humans scare you, excite you?

21:39.240 --> 21:40.040
 What do you think about that?

21:40.040 --> 21:54.680
 So I'm going to tell you about a conversation I once had with Eric Schmidt. I was sitting at a meeting with him and he was a few feet away and he turned to me and he said something like, you know, Jim, and maybe a decade or so, we're going to have computers that do what you do.

21:54.680 --> 22:14.000
 And my response was not unless they can dream, because there's something about the human, the way that we humans actually generate creativity. It's somehow I get this sense of my lived experience and watching creative people that somehow connected to the irrational parts of what goes on in our head and dreaming as part of that irrational thing.

22:14.000 --> 22:25.800
 So unless you can build a piece of artificial intelligence that dreams, have a strong suspicion that you will not get something that will fully be conscious by a definition that I would accept, for example.

22:25.800 --> 22:45.520
 So you mentioned dreaming. You've played around with some out there fascinating ideas. How do you think, and we'll start diving into the world of the very small ideas of super symmetry and all that in terms of visualization, in terms of how do you think about it?

22:45.520 --> 22:50.880
 How do you dream of it? How do you come up with ideas in that fascinating, mysterious space?

22:50.880 --> 23:12.080
 So in my workspace, which is basically where I am charged with coming up on a mathematical palette with new ideas that will help me understand the structure of nature and hopefully help all of us understand structure of nature, I've observed several different ways in which my creativity expresses itself.

23:12.080 --> 23:24.640
 There's one mode which looks pretty normal, which I sort of think of as the Chinese water torture method, just drop, drop, drop. You get more and more information and suddenly it all congeals and you get a clear picture.

23:24.640 --> 23:40.560
 And so that's a kind of a standard way of working. And I think that's how most people think about the way technical people solve problems, that it's kind of you accumulate this body of information and at a certain point you synthesize it and then boom, there's something new.

23:40.560 --> 23:50.680
 But I've also observed in myself and other scientists that there are other ways that we are creative. And these other ways to me are actually far more powerful.

23:50.680 --> 23:56.920
 I first personally experienced this when I was a freshman at MIT, over in Baker House, right across the campus.

23:56.920 --> 24:14.800
 And I was in a calculus course, 1801 is called at MIT, and calculus comes in two different flavors. One of them is called differential calculus. The other is called integral calculus. Differential calculus is the calculus that Newton invented to describe motion.

24:14.800 --> 24:31.240
 It turns out integral calculus was probably invented about 1700 years earlier by Archimedes, but we didn't know that when I was a freshman. But so that's what you study as a student. And the differential calculus part of the course was, to me, how do I say this?

24:31.240 --> 24:48.960
 It was something that by the drip, drip, drip method, you could sort of figure it out. Now, the integral part of calculus, I could memorize the formula. That was not the formula. That was not the problem. The problem was why, in my own mind, why do these formulae work?

24:48.960 --> 25:06.920
 And because of that, when I was in the part of the calculus course where we had to do multiple substitutions to solve integrals, I had a lot of difficulty. I was emotionally involved in my education, because this is where I think the passion in motion comes to.

25:06.920 --> 25:19.440
 And it caused an emotional crisis that I was having these difficulties understanding the integral part of calculus. The why. The why. That's right. The why of it. Not the rote memorization effect, but the why of it. Why does this work?

25:19.440 --> 25:39.000
 And so one night, I was over in my dormitory room in Baker House. I was trying to do a calculus problem set. I was getting nowhere. I got a terrific headache. I went to sleep and had this very strange dream. And when I woke, woke, awakened, I could do three and four

25:39.000 --> 25:57.520
 substitutions in integrals with relative ease. Now, this to me was an astounding experience, because I had never before in my life understood that one subconscious is actually capable of being harnessed to do mathematics. I experienced this, and I've experienced this more than once.

25:57.520 --> 26:14.320
 So this was just the first time why I remember so. So that's why when it comes to like really wickedly tough problems, I think that the kind of creativity that you need to solve them is probably the second variety, which comes somehow from dreaming.

26:16.520 --> 26:25.840
 Do you think, again, I told you I'm Russian, so we romanticize suffering. But do you think part of that equation is the suffering leading up to that dreaming?

26:25.840 --> 26:51.120
 So the suffering is, I am convinced that this kind of creative, the second mode of creativity, as I like to call it, I'm convinced that this second mode of creativity is in fact that suffering is a kind of crucible that triggers it, because the mind, I think, is struggling to get out of this. And the only, the only way, you know, is actually solve the problem.

26:51.120 --> 27:16.400
 And even though you're not consciously solving problems, something is going on. And I've talked about to a few other people, and I've heard other similar stories. And so I, the way I guess what I think about it is it's a little bit by, like the way that thermonuclear weapons work, I don't know if you know how they work, but a thermonuclear weapon is actually two bombs, it's an atomic bomb, which sort of does a compression, and then you have a fusion bomb that goes off.

27:16.400 --> 27:24.240
 And somehow that emotional pressure, I think, acts like the first stage of a thermonuclear weapon. That's when we get really big thoughts.

27:25.600 --> 27:35.680
 The analogy between thermonuclear weapons and the subconscious, the connection there is, at least visually, is kind of interesting.

27:35.680 --> 27:36.960
 Well, I...

27:36.960 --> 27:40.960
 There may be, Freud would have a few things to say.

27:40.960 --> 27:57.600
 Well, part of it is probably based on my own trajectory through life. My father was in the army for U.S. Army for 27 years. And so I started my life out on military basis. And so a lot of probably the things that wander around in my subconscious are connected to that experience.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.920
 I apologize for all the tangents, but...

27:59.920 --> 28:04.400
 Well, you're doing it.

28:04.400 --> 28:14.160
 You're encouraging by answering the stupid questions. Well, they're not stupid. You know, your father was in the army.

28:14.160 --> 28:34.000
 What do you think about a Neil deGrasse Tyson recently wrote a book on interlinking the progress of science to sort of the aspirations of our military endeavors and DARPA funding and so on?

28:34.000 --> 28:42.080
 What do you think about war in general? Do you think we'll always have war? Do you think we'll always have conflict in the world?

28:42.080 --> 28:47.600
 I'm not sure that we're going to be able to afford to have war always. Because if...

28:47.600 --> 28:49.200
 Strictly financially speaking?

28:49.200 --> 29:02.720
 No, not in terms of finance, but in terms of consequences. So if you look at technology today, you can have nonstate actors acquire technology, for example, bioterrorism,

29:02.720 --> 29:10.640
 which whose impact is roughly speaking equivalent to what it used to take nations to impart on a population.

29:10.640 --> 29:17.280
 I think the cost of war is ultimately... I think it's going to work a little bit like the Cold War.

29:17.280 --> 29:30.080
 We survived 50, 60 years as a species with these weapons that are so terrible that they could have actually ended our form of life on this planet, but it didn't. Why didn't it?

29:30.080 --> 29:40.400
 Well, it's a very bizarre and interesting thing, but it was called mutually assured destruction. And so the cost was so great that people eventually figured out that you can't really use these things,

29:40.400 --> 29:46.640
 which is kind of interesting because if you read the history about the development of nuclear weapons, physicists actually realized this pretty quickly.

29:46.640 --> 29:55.920
 I think it was maybe Schrodinger who said that these things are not really weapons, they're political implements, they're not weapons because the cost is so high.

29:55.920 --> 30:06.720
 And if you take that example and spread it out to the kind of technological development we're seeing now outside of nuclear physics, but I picked the example of biology,

30:06.720 --> 30:17.200
 I could well imagine that there would be material science sorts of equivalents across a broad front of technology. You take that experience from nuclear weapons.

30:17.200 --> 30:29.040
 And the picture that I see is that it would be possible to develop technologies that are so terrible that you couldn't use them because the costs are too high. And that might cure us.

30:29.040 --> 30:36.720
 And many people have argued that actually it prevented, nuclear weapons have prevented more military conflict.

30:36.720 --> 30:52.240
 It certainly froze the conflict domain. It's interesting that nowadays it was with the removal of the threat of mutually assured destruction that other forces took over in our geopolitics.

30:52.240 --> 31:06.800
 Do you have worries of existential threats of nuclear weapons or other technologies like artificial intelligence? Do you think we humans will tend to figure out how to not blow ourselves up?

31:06.800 --> 31:25.200
 I don't know, quite frankly. This is something I thought about. And I'm not, I mean, so I'm a spectator in the sense that as a scientist, I collect and collate data. So I've been doing that all my life and looking at my species.

31:25.200 --> 31:34.400
 And it's not clear to me that we are going to avoid a catastrophic self induced ending.

31:34.400 --> 31:45.360
 Are you optimistic? As a, not as a scientist, but as a, I would say, I would say I wouldn't bet against us.

31:45.360 --> 31:59.360
 Beautifully put, let's dive into the world of the very small, if you could, for a bit. What are the basic particles, either experimentally observed or hypothesized by physicists?

31:59.360 --> 32:17.760
 So as we physicists look at the universe, you can, first of all, there are two big buckets of particles that is the smallest objects that we are able to currently mathematically conceive and then experimentally verify that these ideas have a sense of accuracy to them.

32:17.760 --> 32:30.760
 So one of those buckets we call matter. These are things like electrons, things that are like quarks, which are particles that exist inside of protons. And there's a whole family of these things.

32:30.760 --> 32:39.080
 There are in fact 18 quarks and apparently six electron like objects that we call leptons. So that's one bucket.

32:39.080 --> 32:47.840
 The other bucket that we see both in our mathematics as well as in our experimental equipment are what are a set of particles that you can call force carriers.

32:47.840 --> 32:59.040
 The most familiar force carrier is the photon, the particle light that allows you to see me. In fact, it's the same object that carries electric repulsion between like charges from science fiction.

32:59.040 --> 33:13.040
 And then we have the object called the graviton, which is talked about a lot in science fiction and Star Trek. But the graviton is also a mathematical object that we physicists have known about essentially since Einstein wrote his theory of general relativity.

33:13.040 --> 33:27.040
 There are four forces in nature, the fundamental forces. There is the gravitational force, its carrier is the graviton. There are three other forces in nature, the electromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force.

33:27.040 --> 33:36.040
 And each one of these forces has one or more carriers. The photon is the carrier of the electromagnetic force. The strong nuclear force actually has eight carriers.

33:36.040 --> 33:44.040
 They're called gluons. And then the weak nuclear force has three carriers. They're called the W plus W minus and Z bosons.

33:44.040 --> 33:55.040
 So those are the things that both in mathematics and in experiments, the most by the way, the most precise experiments were ever as a species able to conduct is about measuring the accuracy of these ideas.

33:55.040 --> 33:59.040
 And we know that at least to one part in a billion, these ideas are right.

33:59.040 --> 34:14.040
 So first of all, you've made it sound both elegant and simple, but is it crazy to you that there is force carriers? Like, is that supposed to be a trivial idea to think about?

34:14.040 --> 34:29.040
 If you think about photons, gluons, that there's four fundamental forces of physics and then those forces are expressed. There's carriers of those forces. Like, is that a kind of trivial thing?

34:29.040 --> 34:39.040
 It's not a trivial thing at all. In fact, it was a puzzle for Sir Isaac Newton because he's the first person to give us basically physics before Isaac Newton physics didn't exist.

34:39.040 --> 34:47.040
 What did exist was called natural philosophy. So discussions about using the methods of classical philosophy to understand nature, natural philosophy.

34:47.040 --> 34:52.040
 So the Greeks, we call them scientists, but they were natural philosophers.

34:52.040 --> 34:56.040
 Physics doesn't get born until Newton writes the Principia.

34:56.040 --> 35:00.040
 One of the things that puzzled him was how gravity works.

35:00.040 --> 35:21.040
 Because if you read very carefully what he writes, he basically says, and I'm paraphrasing badly, but he basically says that someone who thinks deeply about this subject would find it inconceivable that an object in one place or location can magically reach out and affect another object with nothing intervening.

35:21.040 --> 35:23.040
 And so it puzzled him.

35:23.040 --> 35:32.040
 There's a puzzle of you, action at a distance. I mean, it would, it would, it would accept that I am a physicist and we have long ago resolved this issue.

35:32.040 --> 35:36.040
 And the resolution came about through a second great physicist.

35:36.040 --> 35:45.040
 Most people have heard of Newton. Most people have heard of Einstein, but between the two of them, there was another extraordinarily great physicist, a man named James Clark Maxwell.

35:45.040 --> 35:58.040
 And Maxwell, between these two other giants, taught us about electric and magnetic forces, and it's from his equations that one can figure out that there's a carrier called the photon.

35:58.040 --> 36:03.040
 So this was resolved for physicists around 1860 or so.

36:03.040 --> 36:07.040
 So what are bosons and fermions and hadrons?

36:07.040 --> 36:08.040
 Sure.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.040
 Elementary and composites.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.040
 Sure.

36:10.040 --> 36:12.040
 So earlier I said.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.040
 Two buckets.

36:13.040 --> 36:18.040
 You've got two buckets if you want to try to build the universe. You've got to start off with things on these two buckets.

36:18.040 --> 36:21.040
 So you've got to have things, that's a matter.

36:21.040 --> 36:31.040
 And then you have to have other objects that act on them to cause those things to cohere to fixed finite patterns because you need those fixed finite patterns as building blocks.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.040
 So that's the way our universe looks to people like me.

36:33.040 --> 36:36.040
 Now, the building blocks do different things.

36:36.040 --> 36:39.040
 So let's go back to these two buckets again.

36:39.040 --> 36:42.040
 Let me start with a bucket containing the particle of light.

36:42.040 --> 36:50.040
 Let me imagine I'm in a dusty room with two flashlights and I have one flashlight, which I direct directly in front of me.

36:50.040 --> 36:56.040
 Then I have you stand over to say my left and then we both take our flashlights and turn them on and make sure the beams go right through each other.

36:56.040 --> 37:00.040
 And the beams do just that. They go right through each other. They don't bounce off of each other.

37:00.040 --> 37:03.040
 The reason the room has to be dusty is because we want to see the light.

37:03.040 --> 37:07.040
 The room dust wasn't there. We wouldn't actually see the light until it got to the other wall, right?

37:07.040 --> 37:09.040
 So you see the beam because it's the dust in the air.

37:09.040 --> 37:12.040
 But the dupe beams actually pass right through each other.

37:12.040 --> 37:16.040
 They literally pass right to them. They don't affect each other at all.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.040
 One acts like the other's not there.

37:18.040 --> 37:24.040
 Things, there are, the particle of light is the simplest example that shows that behavior.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.040
 That's a boson.

37:26.040 --> 37:33.040
 Now let's imagine that I have to, where's in the same dusty room and this time you have a bucket of balls and I have a bucket of balls.

37:33.040 --> 37:38.040
 And we try to throw them so that they pass, so that we get something like a beam throwing them fast, right?

37:38.040 --> 37:43.040
 If they collide, they don't just pass through each other. They bounce off of each other.

37:43.040 --> 37:48.040
 Now that's mostly because they have electric charge and electric charges like charges repel.

37:48.040 --> 37:51.040
 But mathematically, I know how to turn off the electric charge.

37:51.040 --> 37:53.040
 And if you do that, you'll find they still repel.

37:53.040 --> 37:57.040
 And it's because they are these things we call fermions.

37:57.040 --> 38:00.040
 So this is how you distinguish the things that are in the two buckets.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.040
 They are either bosons or fermions.

38:03.040 --> 38:09.040
 Which of them, and maybe you can mention the most popular of the bosons.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.040
 The most recently discovered.

38:11.040 --> 38:18.040
 It's like when I was in high school and there was a really popular major hit.

38:18.040 --> 38:21.040
 Her name is the Higgs particle these days.

38:21.040 --> 38:32.040
 Can you describe which of the bosons and fermions have been discovered, hypothesized, which have been experimentally validated but still out there?

38:32.040 --> 38:43.040
 Right. So the two buckets that I've actually described to you have all been first hypothesized and then verified by observation.

38:43.040 --> 38:47.040
 With the Higgs boson being the most recent one of these things.

38:47.040 --> 38:51.040
 We haven't actually verified the graviton, interestingly enough.

38:51.040 --> 38:55.040
 Mathematically, we have an expectation that gravitons like this.

38:55.040 --> 39:00.040
 But we've not performed an experiment to show that this is an accurate idea that nature uses.

39:00.040 --> 39:03.040
 So something has to be a carrier for the force of gravity.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.040
 Exactly.

39:04.040 --> 39:08.040
 Can it be something way more mysterious than we?

39:08.040 --> 39:15.040
 So when you say the graviton, is it, would it be like the other particles, force carriers?

39:15.040 --> 39:18.040
 In some ways, yes, but in other ways, no.

39:18.040 --> 39:26.040
 It turns out that the graviton is also, if you look at Einstein's theory, he taught us about this thing he calls space time.

39:26.040 --> 39:32.040
 Which is, if you try to imagine it, you can sort of think of it as kind of a rubber surface.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.040
 That's one popular depiction of space time.

39:34.040 --> 39:39.040
 It's not an accurate depiction because the only accuracy is actually in the calculus that he uses.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.040
 But that's close enough.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.040
 So if you have a sheet of rubber, you can wave it.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.040
 You can actually form a wave on it.

39:45.040 --> 39:51.040
 Space time is enough like that so that when space time oscillates, you create these waves.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.040
 These waves carry energy.

39:53.040 --> 39:56.040
 Do we expect them to carry energy in quanta? That's what a graviton is.

39:56.040 --> 39:58.040
 It's a wave in space time.

39:58.040 --> 40:04.040
 And so the fact that we have seen the waves with LIGO over the course of the last three years,

40:04.040 --> 40:12.040
 and we've recently used gravitational wave observatories to watch colliding black holes and neutron stars and all sorts of really cool stuff out there.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.040
 So we know the waves exist.

40:14.040 --> 40:20.040
 But in order to know that gravitons exist, you have to prove that these waves carry energy in energy packets.

40:20.040 --> 40:24.040
 And that's what we don't have the technology to do yet.

40:24.040 --> 40:28.040
 And perhaps briefly jumping to a philosophical question.

40:28.040 --> 40:32.040
 Does it make sense to you that gravity is so much weaker than the other forces?

40:32.040 --> 40:34.040
 No.

40:38.040 --> 40:42.040
 You see, now you've touched on a very deep mystery about physics.

40:42.040 --> 40:47.040
 There are a lot of such questions in physics about why things are as they are.

40:47.040 --> 40:53.040
 And as someone who believes that there are some things that certainly are coincidences,

40:53.040 --> 40:58.040
 like you could ask the same question about, well, why are the planets at the orbits that they are around the sun?

40:58.040 --> 41:01.040
 The answer turns out there is no good reason. It's just an accident.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.040
 So there are things in nature that have that character.

41:03.040 --> 41:08.040
 And perhaps the strength of the various forces is like that.

41:08.040 --> 41:11.040
 On the other hand, we don't know that that's the case.

41:11.040 --> 41:17.040
 There may be some deep reasons about why the forces are ordered as they are, where the weakest force is gravity,

41:17.040 --> 41:23.040
 the next weakest force is the weak interaction, the weak nuclear force, then there's electromagnetism, there's a strong force.

41:23.040 --> 41:28.040
 We don't really have a good understanding of why this is the ordering of the forces.

41:28.040 --> 41:36.040
 Some of the fascinating work you've done is in the space of supersymmetry, symmetry in general.

41:36.040 --> 41:39.040
 Can you describe, first of all, what is supersymmetry?

41:39.040 --> 41:43.040
 Ah, yes. So you remember the two buckets I told you about perhaps earlier.

41:43.040 --> 41:46.040
 So there are two buckets in our universe.

41:46.040 --> 41:53.040
 So now I want you to think about drawing a pie that has four quadrants.

41:53.040 --> 41:56.040
 So I want you to cut the piece of pie in fourths.

41:56.040 --> 42:01.040
 So in one quadrant, I'm going to put all the buckets that we talked about that are like the electron and the quarks.

42:01.040 --> 42:04.040
 In a different quadrant, I'm going to put all the force carriers.

42:04.040 --> 42:06.040
 The other two quadrants are empty.

42:06.040 --> 42:10.040
 Now, if I showed you a picture of that, you'd see a circle.

42:10.040 --> 42:14.040
 There would be a bunch of stuff in one upper quadrant and stuff in others.

42:14.040 --> 42:18.040
 And then I would ask you a question. Does that look symmetrical to you?

42:18.040 --> 42:20.040
 No.

42:20.040 --> 42:28.040
 No. And that's exactly right because we humans actually have a very deeply programmed sense of symmetry.

42:28.040 --> 42:32.040
 It's something that is part of that mystery of the universe.

42:32.040 --> 42:34.040
 So how would you make it symmetrical?

42:34.040 --> 42:38.040
 One way you could is by saying those two empty quadrants had things in them also.

42:38.040 --> 42:42.040
 And if you do that, that's supersymmetry.

42:42.040 --> 42:48.040
 So that's what I understood when I was a graduate student here at MIT in 1975.

42:48.040 --> 42:56.040
 When the mathematics of this was first being born, supersymmetry was actually born in the Ukraine in the late 60s.

42:56.040 --> 43:00.040
 But we had this thing called the iron curtain, so we Westerners didn't know about it.

43:00.040 --> 43:07.040
 But by the early 70s, independently, there were scientists in the West who had rediscovered supersymmetry.

43:07.040 --> 43:10.040
 Bruno Zemino and Julius Vest were their names.

43:10.040 --> 43:14.040
 So this was around 71 or 72 when this happened.

43:14.040 --> 43:16.040
 I started graduate school in 73.

43:16.040 --> 43:23.040
 So around 74 or 75, I was trying to figure out how to write a thesis so that I could become a physicist the rest of my life.

43:23.040 --> 43:33.040
 I had a great advisor, Professor James Young, who had taught me a number of things about electrons and weak forces and those sorts of things.

43:33.040 --> 43:45.040
 But I decided that if I was going to have an opportunity to maximize my chances of being successful,

43:45.040 --> 43:48.040
 I should strike it out in a direction that other people were not studying.

43:48.040 --> 43:54.040
 And so as a consequence, I surveyed ideas that were going, that were being developed.

43:54.040 --> 43:56.040
 And I came across the idea of supersymmetry.

43:56.040 --> 44:03.040
 And it was so, the mathematics was so remarkable that I just, it bowled me over.

44:03.040 --> 44:05.040
 I actually have two undergraduate degrees.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.040
 My first undergraduate degree is actually mathematics.

44:07.040 --> 44:12.040
 And my second is physics, even though I always wanted to be a physicist.

44:12.040 --> 44:17.040
 Plan A, which involved getting good grades was mathematics.

44:17.040 --> 44:22.040
 I was a mathematics major thinking about graduate school, but my heart was in physics.

44:22.040 --> 44:33.040
 If we could take a small digression, what's to you the most beautiful idea in mathematics that you've encountered in this interplay between math and physics?

44:33.040 --> 44:35.040
 It's the idea of symmetry.

44:35.040 --> 44:47.040
 The fact that our innate sense of symmetry winds up aligning with just incredible mathematics, to me, is the most beautiful thing.

44:47.040 --> 44:53.040
 It's very strange, but true, that if symmetries were perfect, we would not exist.

44:53.040 --> 44:57.040
 And so even though we have these very powerful ideas about balance in the universe in some sense,

44:57.040 --> 45:03.040
 it's only when you break those balances that you get creatures like humans and objects like planets and stars.

45:03.040 --> 45:09.040
 So although they are a scaffold for reality, they cannot be the entirety of reality.

45:09.040 --> 45:21.040
 So I'm kind of naturally attracted to parts of science and technology where symmetry plays a dominant role.

45:21.040 --> 45:26.040
 And not just, I guess, symmetry, as you said, but the magic happens when you break the symmetry.

45:26.040 --> 45:29.040
 The magic happens when you break the symmetry.

45:29.040 --> 45:33.040
 Okay, so diving right back in, you mentioned four quadrants.

45:33.040 --> 45:34.040
 Yes.

45:34.040 --> 45:37.040
 Two are filled with stuff with two buckets.

45:37.040 --> 45:41.040
 And then there's crazy mathematical ideas for filling the other two.

45:41.040 --> 45:42.040
 The other two.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.040
 What are those things?

45:43.040 --> 45:52.040
 So earlier, the way I described these two buckets is I gave you a story that started out by putting us in a dusty room with two flashlights.

45:52.040 --> 45:55.040
 And I said, turn on your flashlight, I'll turn on mine.

45:55.040 --> 45:57.040
 The beams will go through each other.

45:57.040 --> 46:01.040
 And the beams are composed of force carriers called photons.

46:01.040 --> 46:03.040
 They carry the electromagnetic force.

46:03.040 --> 46:05.040
 And they pass right through each other.

46:05.040 --> 46:11.040
 So imagine looking at the mathematics as such an object, which you don't have to imagine people like me do that.

46:11.040 --> 46:15.040
 So you take that mathematics and then you ask yourself a question.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.040
 You see, mathematics is a palette.

46:17.040 --> 46:24.040
 It's just like a musical composer is able to construct variations on a theme.

46:24.040 --> 46:29.040
 Well, a piece of mathematics in the hand of a physicist is something that we can construct variations on.

46:29.040 --> 46:38.040
 So even though the mathematics that Maxwell gave us about light, we know how to construct variations on that.

46:38.040 --> 46:49.040
 And one of the variations you can construct is to say, suppose you have a force carrier for electromagnetism that behaves like an electron in that it would bounce off of another one.

46:49.040 --> 46:53.040
 That's changing a mathematical term in an equation.

46:53.040 --> 46:56.040
 So if you did that, you would have a force carrier.

46:56.040 --> 46:59.040
 So you would say first it belongs in this force carrying bucket.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.040
 But it's got this property of bouncing off like electrons.

47:01.040 --> 47:04.040
 So you say, well, gee, wait, no, that's not the right bucket.

47:04.040 --> 47:07.040
 So you're forced to actually put it in one of these empty quadrants.

47:07.040 --> 47:16.040
 So those sorts of things, basically we give them, so the photon mathematically can be accompanied by a fotino.

47:16.040 --> 47:20.040
 It's the thing that carries a force but has the rule of bouncing off.

47:20.040 --> 47:24.040
 In a similar manner, you could start with an electron.

47:24.040 --> 47:27.040
 And you say, OK, so write down the mathematical electron.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.040
 I know how to do that.

47:28.040 --> 47:33.040
 A physicist named Rack first told us how to do that back in the 1920s, early 30s.

47:33.040 --> 47:44.040
 So take that mathematics and then you say, let me look at that mathematics and find out what in the mathematics caused those two electrons to bounce off of each other, even if I turn off the electrical charge.

47:44.040 --> 47:45.040
 So I could do that.

47:45.040 --> 47:48.040
 And now let me change that mathematical term.

47:48.040 --> 47:50.040
 So now I have something that carries electrical charge.

47:50.040 --> 47:55.040
 But if you take two of them, I'm sorry, if you turn their charges off, they'll pass through each other.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.040
 So that puts things in the other quadrant.

47:57.040 --> 48:02.040
 And those things we tend to call, we put the s in front of their name.

48:02.040 --> 48:04.040
 So in the lower quadrant here, we have electrons.

48:04.040 --> 48:08.040
 And this now newly filled quadrant, we have electrons.

48:08.040 --> 48:12.040
 And the quadrant over here, we had quarks.

48:12.040 --> 48:13.040
 Over here, we have squarks.

48:13.040 --> 48:22.040
 So now we've got this balanced pi and that's basically what I understood as a graduate student in 1975 about this idea of supersymmetry.

48:22.040 --> 48:27.040
 That it was going to fill up these two quadrants of the pi in a way that no one had ever thought about before.

48:27.040 --> 48:32.040
 So I was amazed that no one else at MIT found this an interesting idea.

48:32.040 --> 48:39.040
 So that's, it led to my becoming the first person in MIT to really study supersymmetry.

48:39.040 --> 48:43.040
 This is 1975, 76, 77.

48:43.040 --> 48:50.040
 And in 77, I wrote the first PhD thesis in the physics department on this idea because I just, I was drawn to the balance.

48:50.040 --> 48:52.040
 Draw into the symmetry.

48:52.040 --> 49:01.040
 So what does that, first of all, is this fundamentally a mathematical idea?

49:01.040 --> 49:11.040
 So how much experimental, and we'll have this theme, it's a really interesting one, when you explore the world of the small and in your new book talking about

49:11.040 --> 49:19.040
 approving Einstein Wright that we'll also talk about, there's this theme of kind of starting it, exploring crazy ideas first in the mathematics,

49:19.040 --> 49:23.040
 and then seeking for ways to experimentally validate them.

49:23.040 --> 49:25.040
 Where do you put supersymmetry in that?

49:25.040 --> 49:28.040
 It's closer than string theory.

49:28.040 --> 49:30.040
 It has not yet been validated.

49:30.040 --> 49:35.040
 In some sense, you mentioned Einstein, so let's go there for a moment.

49:35.040 --> 49:46.040
 In our book, Proving Einstein Wright, we actually do talk about the fact that Albert Einstein in 1915 wrote a set of equations which were very different from Newton's equations in describing gravity.

49:46.040 --> 49:51.040
 These equations made some predictions that were different from Newton's predictions.

49:51.040 --> 49:53.040
 It actually made three different predictions.

49:53.040 --> 50:01.040
 One of them was not actually a prediction, but a postdiction, because it was known that Mercury was not orbiting the Sun in the way that Newton would have told you.

50:01.040 --> 50:10.040
 And so, Einstein's theory actually describes Mercury orbiting in a way that was observed as opposed to what Newton would have told you.

50:10.040 --> 50:12.040
 So that was one prediction.

50:12.040 --> 50:22.040
 The second prediction that came out of the theory of general relativity, which Einstein wrote in 1915, was that if you...

50:22.040 --> 50:24.040
 So let me describe an experiment and come back to it.

50:24.040 --> 50:34.040
 Suppose I had a glass of water, and I filled the glass up, and then I moved the glass slowly back and forth between our two faces.

50:34.040 --> 50:39.040
 It would appear to me like your face was moving, even though you weren't moving.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.040
 I mean, it's actually...

50:40.040 --> 50:46.040
 And what's causing it is because the light gets bent through the glass as it passes from your face to my eye.

50:46.040 --> 50:56.040
 So Einstein, in his 1915 theory of general relativity, found out that gravity has the same effect on light as that glass of water.

50:56.040 --> 50:59.040
 It would cause beams of light to bend.

50:59.040 --> 51:05.040
 Now, Newton also knew this, but Einstein's prediction was that light would bend twice as much.

51:05.040 --> 51:08.040
 And so, here's a mathematical idea.

51:08.040 --> 51:10.040
 Now, how do you actually prove it?

51:10.040 --> 51:12.040
 Well, you've got to watch...

51:12.040 --> 51:16.040
 Just a quick pause on that, just the language you're using.

51:16.040 --> 51:18.040
 He found out...

51:18.040 --> 51:20.040
 I can say he did a calculation.

51:20.040 --> 51:23.040
 It's a really interesting notion that one of the most...

51:23.040 --> 51:32.040
 One of the beautiful things about this universe is you can do a calculation and combine with some of that magical intuition that physicists have,

51:32.040 --> 51:35.040
 actually predict what would be...

51:35.040 --> 51:37.040
 what's possible to experiment to validate.

51:37.040 --> 51:38.040
 That's correct.

51:38.040 --> 51:45.040
 So he found out in the sense that there seems to be something here and mathematically should bend...

51:45.040 --> 51:48.040
 gravity should bend like this amount.

51:48.040 --> 51:51.040
 And so, therefore, that's something that could be potentially...

51:51.040 --> 51:53.040
 and then come up with an experiment that could be validated.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.040
 Right.

51:54.040 --> 52:00.040
 And that's the way that actually modern physics is deeply fundamental in modern physics.

52:00.040 --> 52:02.040
 This is how it works.

52:02.040 --> 52:04.040
 Earlier, we spoke about the Higgs boson.

52:04.040 --> 52:07.040
 So why did we go looking for it?

52:07.040 --> 52:12.040
 The answer is that back in the late 60s, early 70s,

52:12.040 --> 52:16.040
 some people wrote some equations and the equations predicted this.

52:16.040 --> 52:19.040
 So then we went looking for it.

52:19.040 --> 52:26.040
 So on supersymmetry for a second, there's these things called idinquist symbols,

52:26.040 --> 52:28.040
 these strange little graphs.

52:28.040 --> 52:32.040
 You refer to them as revealing something like binary code...

52:32.040 --> 52:34.040
 underlying reality.

52:34.040 --> 52:37.040
 So can you describe these graphs?

52:37.040 --> 52:41.040
 What are these beautiful little strange graphs?

52:41.040 --> 52:48.040
 Well, first of all idinquist are an invention of mine together with a colleague named Michael Fox in 2005.

52:48.040 --> 52:50.040
 We were looking at equations.

52:50.040 --> 52:52.040
 The story is a little bit more complicated.

52:52.040 --> 52:54.040
 It would take too long to explain all the details.

52:54.040 --> 52:58.040
 But the reader's digest version is that we were looking at these equations

52:58.040 --> 53:04.040
 and we figured out that all the data in a certain class of equations could be put in pictures.

53:04.040 --> 53:07.040
 And the pictures, what do they look like?

53:07.040 --> 53:09.040
 They're just little balls.

53:09.040 --> 53:12.040
 You have black balls and white balls.

53:12.040 --> 53:16.040
 Those stand for those two buckets, by the way, that we talk about in reality.

53:16.040 --> 53:19.040
 The white balls are things that are like particles of light.

53:19.040 --> 53:21.040
 The black balls are like electrons.

53:21.040 --> 53:24.040
 And then you can draw lines connecting these balls.

53:24.040 --> 53:29.040
 And these lines are deeply mathematical objects and there's no way for me to...

53:29.040 --> 53:34.040
 I have no physical model for telling you what the lines are.

53:34.040 --> 53:38.040
 But if you were a mathematician, I would do a technical phase saying

53:38.040 --> 53:42.040
 this is the orbit of the representation and the action of the symmetry generators.

53:42.040 --> 53:44.040
 Mathematicians will understand that.

53:44.040 --> 53:47.040
 Nobody else in the right mind would, so let's not go there.

53:47.040 --> 53:53.040
 But we figured out that the data that was in the equations was in these funny pictures that we could draw.

53:53.040 --> 53:56.040
 And so that was stunning.

53:56.040 --> 54:02.040
 But it also was encouraging because there are problems with the equations,

54:02.040 --> 54:08.040
 which I had first learned about in 1979 when I was down at Harvard.

54:08.040 --> 54:13.040
 I went out to Caltech for the first time and working with a great scientist by the name of John Schwartz.

54:13.040 --> 54:16.040
 There are problems in the equations we don't know how to solve.

54:16.040 --> 54:20.040
 And so one of the things about solving problems that you don't know how to solve

54:20.040 --> 54:25.040
 is that beating your head against a brick wall is probably not a good philosophy about how to solve it.

54:25.040 --> 54:27.040
 So what do you need to do?

54:27.040 --> 54:31.040
 You need to change your sense of reference, your frame of reference, your perspective.

54:31.040 --> 54:36.040
 So when I saw these funny pictures, I thought,

54:36.040 --> 54:41.040
 gee, that might be a way to solve these problems with equations that we don't know how to do.

54:41.040 --> 54:47.040
 So that was, for me, one of the first attractions is that I now had an alternative language

54:47.040 --> 54:51.040
 to try to attack a set of mathematical problems.

54:51.040 --> 54:58.040
 But I quickly realized that, A, this mathematical language was not known by mathematicians,

54:58.040 --> 55:03.040
 which makes it pretty interesting because now you have to actually teach mathematicians

55:03.040 --> 55:06.040
 about a piece of mathematics because that's how they make their living.

55:06.040 --> 55:11.040
 And the great thing about working with mathematicians, of course, is the rigor with which they examine ideas.

55:11.040 --> 55:14.040
 So they make your ideas better than they start out.

55:14.040 --> 55:18.040
 So I started working with a group of mathematicians, and it was in that collaboration

55:18.040 --> 55:23.040
 that we figured out that these funny pictures had error correcting codes buried in them.

55:23.040 --> 55:24.040
 So...

55:24.040 --> 55:26.040
 Can you talk about what are error correcting codes?

55:26.040 --> 55:27.040
 Sure.

55:27.040 --> 55:37.040
 So the simplest way to talk about error correcting codes is, first of all, to talk about digital information.

55:37.040 --> 55:40.040
 Digital information is basically strings of ones and zeros.

55:40.040 --> 55:41.040
 They're called bits.

55:41.040 --> 55:46.040
 So now let's imagine that I want to send you some bits.

55:46.040 --> 55:52.040
 Well, maybe I can show you pictures, but maybe it's a rainy day,

55:52.040 --> 55:56.040
 or maybe the windows in your house are foggy.

55:56.040 --> 56:01.040
 So sometimes when I show you a zero, you might interpret it as a one.

56:01.040 --> 56:05.040
 Or other times when I show you a one, you might interpret it as a zero.

56:05.040 --> 56:10.040
 So if that's the case, that means when I try to send you this data, it comes to you in corrupted form.

56:10.040 --> 56:15.040
 And so the challenge is, how do you get it to be uncorrupted?

56:15.040 --> 56:26.040
 In the 1940s, a computer scientist named Hamming addressed the problem of how do you reliably transmit digital information?

56:26.040 --> 56:29.040
 And what he came up with was a brilliant idea.

56:29.040 --> 56:33.040
 The way to solve it is that you take the data that you want to send,

56:33.040 --> 56:36.040
 the ones in your strings of ones and zeros, your favorite string,

56:36.040 --> 56:41.040
 and then you dump more ones and zeros in, but you dump them in in a particular pattern.

56:41.040 --> 56:45.040
 And this particular pattern is what a Hamming code is all about.

56:45.040 --> 56:50.040
 So it's an error correcting code, because if the person at the other knows what the pattern is supposed to be,

56:50.040 --> 56:54.040
 they can figure out when one's got changed to zeros, there's got to be one.

56:54.040 --> 57:01.040
 So it turned out that our strange little objects that came from looking at the equations that we couldn't solve,

57:01.040 --> 57:07.040
 it turns out that when you look at them deeply enough, you find out that they have ones and zeros buried in them.

57:07.040 --> 57:11.040
 But even more astoundingly, the ones and zeros are not there randomly.

57:11.040 --> 57:14.040
 They are in the pattern of error correcting codes.

57:14.040 --> 57:20.040
 So this was an astounding thing that when we first got this result and tried to publish it,

57:20.040 --> 57:23.040
 it took us three years to convince other physicists that we weren't crazy.

57:23.040 --> 57:25.040
 Eventually we were able to publish it.

57:25.040 --> 57:29.040
 I and this collaboration of mathematicians and other physicists.

57:29.040 --> 57:35.040
 And so every since then, I have actually been looking at the mathematics of these objects,

57:35.040 --> 57:39.040
 trying to still understand properties of the equations.

57:39.040 --> 57:43.040
 And I want to understand the properties of equations because I want to be able to try things that are like electrons.

57:43.040 --> 57:48.040
 So as you can see, it's just like a two step removed process of trying to get back to reality.

57:48.040 --> 57:56.040
 So what would you say is the most beautiful property of these adinkra graphs, objects?

57:56.040 --> 58:01.040
 What do you think, by the way, the word symbols, what do you think of them, these simple graphs?

58:01.040 --> 58:04.040
 Are they objects or?

58:04.040 --> 58:06.040
 How should we think about that?

58:06.040 --> 58:13.040
 For people who work with mathematics like me, our mathematical concepts are, we often refer to them as objects

58:13.040 --> 58:15.040
 because they feel like real things.

58:15.040 --> 58:23.040
 Even though you can't see them or touch them, there's so much part of your interior life that it is as if you could.

58:23.040 --> 58:28.040
 So we often refer to these things as objects, even though there's nothing objective about them.

58:28.040 --> 58:31.040
 And what does a single graph represent in space?

58:31.040 --> 58:36.040
 Okay, so the simplest of these graphs has to have one white ball and one black ball.

58:36.040 --> 58:38.040
 That's that balance that we talked about earlier.

58:38.040 --> 58:40.040
 Remember, we want to balance out the quadrants?

58:40.040 --> 58:43.040
 Well, you can't do it unless you have a black ball and white ball.

58:43.040 --> 58:49.040
 So the simplest of these objects looks like two little balls, one black, one white, connected by a single line.

58:49.040 --> 58:54.040
 And what it's talking about is, as I said, a deep mathematical property related to symmetry.

58:54.040 --> 59:01.040
 You've mentioned the error correcting codes, but is there a particular beautiful property that stands out to you about these objects that you just find?

59:01.040 --> 59:02.040
 Yes.

59:02.040 --> 59:04.040
 They're very early on in the development.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.040
 Yes, there is.

59:05.040 --> 59:19.040
 The craziest thing about these to me is that when you look at physics and try to write equations where information gets transmitted reliably,

59:19.040 --> 59:26.040
 if you're in one of these supersymmetrical systems with this extra symmetry, that doesn't happen unless there's an error correcting code present.

59:26.040 --> 59:33.040
 So as if the universe says, you don't read the transmit information unless there's something about an error correcting code.

59:33.040 --> 59:38.040
 This to me is the craziest thing that I've ever personally encountered in my research.

59:38.040 --> 59:47.040
 And it's actually got me to wondering how this could come about because the only place in nature that we know about error correcting codes is genetics.

59:47.040 --> 59:53.040
 And in genetics, we think it was evolution that causes error correcting codes to be in genomes.

59:53.040 --> 59:59.040
 And so does that mean that there was some kind of form of evolution acting on the mathematical laws of the physics of our universe?

59:59.040 --> 1:00:01.040
 This is a very bizarre and strange idea.

1:00:01.040 --> 1:00:05.040
 And it's something I've wondered about from time to time since making these discoveries.

1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:12.040
 Do you think such an idea could be fundamental or is it emergent throughout all the different kinds of systems?

1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:15.040
 I don't know whether it's fundamental.

1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:18.040
 I probably will not live to find out.

1:00:18.040 --> 1:00:24.040
 This is going to be the work of probably some future either mathematician or physicist to figure out what these things actually mean.

1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:31.040
 We have to talk a bit about the magical, the mysterious string theory, super string theory.

1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:32.040
 Sure.

1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:44.040
 There's still maybe this aspect of it, which is there's still, for me, from an outsider's perspective, this fascinating heated debate on the status of string theory.

1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:50.040
 Can you clarify this debate, perhaps articulating the various views and say where you land on it?

1:00:50.040 --> 1:01:01.040
 So first of all, I doubt that I will be able to say anything to clarify the debate around string theory for general audience.

1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:08.040
 Part of the reason is because string theory has done something I've never seen theoretical physics do.

1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:13.040
 It has broken out into consciousness of the general public before we're finished.

1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:20.040
 You see, string theory doesn't actually exist because when we use the word theory, we mean a particular set of attributes.

1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:26.040
 In particular, it means that you have an overarching paradigm that explains what it is that you're doing.

1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:30.040
 No such overarching paradigm exists for string theory.

1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:39.040
 What string theory is currently is an enormously large mutually reinforcing collection of mathematical facts in which we can find no contradictions.

1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:44.040
 We don't know why it's there, but we can certainly say that without challenge.

1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:49.040
 Now, just because you find a piece of mathematics doesn't mean that this applies to nature.

1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:59.040
 And in fact, there has been a very heated debate about whether string theory is some sort of hysteria among the community of theoretical physicists,

1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:04.040
 or whether it has something fundamental to say about our universe.

1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:08.040
 We don't yet know the answer to that question.

1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:16.040
 What those of us who study string theory will tell you are things like string theory has been extraordinarily productive in getting us to think more deeply,

1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:23.040
 even about mathematics that's not string theory, but the kind of mathematics that we've used to describe elementary particles.

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:28.040
 There have been spin off some string theory, and this has been going on now for two decades almost,

1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:36.040
 that have allowed us, for example, to more accurately calculate the force between electrons with the presence of quantum mechanics.

1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:39.040
 This is not something you hear about in the public.

1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:41.040
 There are other similar things.

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:48.040
 That kind of property I just told you about is what's called weak strong duality, and it comes directly from string theory.

1:02:48.040 --> 1:03:01.040
 There are other things such as a property called holography, which allows one to take equations and look at them on the boundary of a space,

1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:06.040
 and then to know information about inside a space without actually doing calculations there.

1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:08.040
 This has come directly from string theory.

1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:14.040
 There are a number of direct mathematical effects that we learn in string theory,

1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:19.040
 but we take these ideas and look at math that we already know, and we find suddenly we're more powerful.

1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:23.040
 This is a pretty good indication there's something interesting going on with string theory itself.

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:26.040
 So it's the early days of a powerful mathematical framework.

1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:27.040
 That's what we have right now.

1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:36.040
 First of all, for most people, which, as you said, most general public would know actually what string theory is,

1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:41.040
 which is at the highest level, which is a fascinating fact.

1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:46.040
 Well, string theory is what they do on the Big Bang Theory, right?

1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:56.040
 One, can you maybe describe what is string theory, and two, what are the open challenges?

1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:58.040
 So what is string theory?

1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:06.040
 Well, the simplest explanation I can provide is to go back and ask what are particles,

1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:10.040
 which is the question you first asked me.

1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:12.040
 What's the smallest thing?

1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:14.040
 Yeah, what's the smallest thing?

1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:25.040
 So particles, one way I try to describe particles to people is start, I want you to imagine a little ball.

1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:29.040
 Then I want you to let the size of that ball shrink until it has no extent whatsoever.

1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:33.040
 But it still has the mass of the ball.

1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:37.040
 That's actually what Newton was working with when he first invented physics.

1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:44.040
 He's the real inventor of the massive particle, which is this idea that underlies all of physics.

1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:45.040
 So that's where we start.

1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:51.040
 It's a mathematical construct that you get by taking a limit of things that you know.

1:04:51.040 --> 1:04:53.040
 So what's a string?

1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:58.040
 Well, in the same analogy, I would say now I want you to start with a piece of spaghetti.

1:04:58.040 --> 1:05:00.040
 So we all know what that looks like.

1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:06.040
 And now I want you to let the thickness of the spaghetti shrink until it has no thickness.

1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:09.040
 Mathematically, I mean, in words, this makes no sense.

1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:12.040
 Mathematically, this actually works.

1:05:12.040 --> 1:05:14.040
 And you get this mathematical object out.

1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:16.040
 It has properties that are like spaghetti.

1:05:16.040 --> 1:05:18.040
 It can wiggle and jiggle.

1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:22.040
 But it can also move collectively like a piece of spaghetti.

1:05:22.040 --> 1:05:28.040
 It's the mathematics of those sorts of objects that constitute string theory.

1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:34.040
 And does the multi dimensional, eleven dimensional, however many dimensional,

1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:39.040
 more than four dimension, is that a crazy idea to you?

1:05:39.040 --> 1:05:43.040
 Is that the stranger aspect of string theory to you?

1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:44.040
 Not really.

1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:48.040
 And also partly because of my own research.

1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:54.040
 So earlier we talked about these strange symbols that we've discovered inside the equations.

1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:58.040
 It turns out that to a very large extent, a dinkers don't really care about the number of dimensions.

1:05:58.040 --> 1:06:04.040
 They kind of have an internal mathematical consistency that allows them to be manifested in many different dimensions.

1:06:04.040 --> 1:06:11.040
 Since supersymmetry is a part of string theory, then the same property you would expect to be inherited by string theory.

1:06:11.040 --> 1:06:19.040
 However, another little known fact, which is not in the public debate, is that there are actually strings that are only four dimensional.

1:06:19.040 --> 1:06:27.040
 This is something that was discovered at the end of the eighties by three different groups of physicists working independently.

1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:31.040
 I and my friend Warren Siegel, who were at the University of Maryland at the time,

1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:36.040
 were able to prove that there's mathematics that looks totally four dimensional and yet it's a string.

1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:42.040
 There was a group in Germany that used slightly different mathematics, but they found the same result.

1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:47.040
 And then there was a group at Cornell who, using yet a third piece of mathematics, found the same result.

1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:57.040
 So the fact that extra dimensions is so widely talked about in the public is partly a function of how the public has come to understand string theory

1:06:57.040 --> 1:06:59.040
 and how the story has been told to them.

1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:02.040
 But there are alternatives you don't know about.

1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:11.040
 If we could talk about maybe experimental validation and you're the coauthor of a recently published book,

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:19.040
 Proving Einstein Right, the human story of it too, the daring expeditions that changed how we look at the universe.

1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:29.040
 Do you see echoes of the early days of general relativity in the 1910s to the more stretched out to string theory?

1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:30.040
 I do.

1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:31.040
 I do.

1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:40.040
 And that's one reason why I was happy to focus on the story of how Einstein became a global superstar.

1:07:40.040 --> 1:07:53.040
 Earlier in our discussion, we went over his history where in 1915 he came up with this piece of mathematics,

1:07:53.040 --> 1:07:57.040
 used it to do some calculations, and then made a prediction.

1:07:57.040 --> 1:07:58.040
 Yes.

1:07:58.040 --> 1:08:00.040
 But making a prediction is not enough.

1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:03.040
 Someone's got to go out and measure.

1:08:03.040 --> 1:08:07.040
 And so string theory is in that in between zone.

1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:10.040
 Now for Einstein, it was from 1915 to 1919.

1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:14.040
 In 1950, he makes the correct prediction.

1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:20.040
 By the way, he made an incorrect prediction about the same thing in 1911, but he corrected himself in 1950.

1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:30.040
 And by 1919, the first pieces of experimental observational data became available to say, yes, he's not wrong.

1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:38.040
 And by 1922, the argument that based on observation was overwhelming that he was not wrong.

1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:42.040
 Can you describe what special and general relativity are just briefly?

1:08:42.040 --> 1:08:43.040
 Sure.

1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:57.040
 And what prediction Einstein made, and maybe some or a memorable moment from the human journey of trying to prove this thing right, which is incredible.

1:08:57.040 --> 1:08:58.040
 Sure.

1:08:58.040 --> 1:08:59.040
 Right.

1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:10.040
 So I'm very fortunate to have worked with a talented novelist who wanted to write a book that coincided with a book I wanted to write about

1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:14.040
 how science kind of feels if you're a person.

1:09:14.040 --> 1:09:20.040
 Because it's actually people who do science, even though that may not be obvious to everyone.

1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:23.040
 So for me, I wanted to write this book for a couple of reasons.

1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:34.040
 I wanted young people to understand that the seeming alien giants that live before them were just as human as they are.

1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:35.040
 They get married.

1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:36.040
 They get divorced.

1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:37.040
 They get married.

1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:38.040
 They get divorced.

1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:40.040
 They do great things.

1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:41.040
 They're people.

1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:42.040
 They're just people like you.

1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:49.040
 And so that part of telling the story allowed me to get that out there for both young people interested in the sciences as well as the public.

1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:59.040
 But the other part of the story is I wanted to open up sort of what it was like.

1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:03.040
 Now, I'm a scientist, and so I will not pretend to be a great writer.

1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:12.040
 I understand a lot about mathematics, and I've even created my own mathematics that, you know, is kind of a weird thing to be able to do.

1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:20.040
 But in order to tell the story, you really have to have an incredible master of the narrative.

1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:24.040
 And that was my coauthor, Kathy Pelletier, who is a novelist.

1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:28.040
 So we formed this conjoined brain I used to call us.

1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:34.040
 Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle, my expression for us is that we were conjoined brain to tell this story.

1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:36.040
 And it allowed.

1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:39.040
 So what are some magical moments?

1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:51.040
 To me, the first magical moment in telling the story was looking at Albert Einstein in his struggle because although we regard him as a genius.

1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:55.040
 As I said, in 1911, he actually made an incorrect prediction about bending starlight.

1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:59.040
 And that's actually what set the astronomers off.

1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:03.040
 In 1914, there was an eclipse.

1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:12.040
 And by various accidents of war and weather and all sorts of things that we talk about in the book, no one was able to make the measurement.

1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:23.040
 If they had made the measurement, it would have disagreed with his 1911 prediction because nature only has one answer.

1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:35.040
 And so you then you see how fortunate he was that wars and bad weather and accidents and transporting equipment stopped any measurements from being made.

1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:38.040
 So he corrects himself in 1915.

1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:41.040
 And but the astronomers are already out there trying to make the measurement.

1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:43.040
 So now he gives them a different number.

1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:46.040
 And it turns out that's the number that nature agrees with.

1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:53.040
 So it gives you a sense of this is a person struggling with something deeply.

1:11:53.040 --> 1:12:04.040
 And it, although his deep insight led him to this, it is the circumstance of time, place and accident through which we view him.

1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:12.040
 And it could the story could have turned out very differently where first he makes a prediction, the measurements are made in 1914.

1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:14.040
 They disagree with his prediction.

1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:15.040
 And so what would the world view him as?

1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:19.040
 Well, he's this professor who made this prediction that didn't get it right.

1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:20.040
 Yes.

1:12:20.040 --> 1:12:27.040
 So the fragility of human history is illustrated by that story.

1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:29.040
 And it's one of my favorite things.

1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:38.040
 You also learn things like in our book, how eclipses and watching eclipses was a driver of the development of science in our nation when it was very young.

1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:50.040
 In fact, even before we were a nation, it turns out there were citizens of citizens of this would be country that were going out trying to measure eclipses.

1:12:50.040 --> 1:12:57.040
 So some fortune, some misfortune affects the progress of science.

1:12:57.040 --> 1:12:58.040
 Absolutely.

1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:09.040
 And especially with ideas as to me, at least if I put myself back in those days as radical as general relativity is.

1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:15.040
 First, can you describe if it's okay briefly what general relativity is?

1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:24.040
 And yeah, could you just take a moment of, yeah, put yourself in those shoes in the academic researchers, scientists of that time.

1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:29.040
 And what is this theory? What is it trying to describe about our world?

1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:38.040
 It's trying to answer the thing that left Isaac Newton puzzled.

1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:42.040
 Isaac Newton says gravity magically goes from one place to another.

1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:44.040
 He doesn't believe it, by the way.

1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:46.040
 He knows that's not right.

1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:52.040
 But the mathematics is so good that you have to say, well, I'll throw my qualms away because I'll use it.

1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:58.040
 That's all we use to get a man from the Earth to the Moon was that mathematics.

1:13:58.040 --> 1:14:03.040
 So I'm one of those scientists and I've seen this.

1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:08.040
 And if I thought deeply about it, maybe I know that Newton himself wasn't comfortable.

1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:20.040
 And so the first thing I would hope that I would feel is, gee, there's this young kid out there who has an idea to fill in this hole that was left with us by Sir Isaac Newton.

1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:23.040
 That would, I hope, would be my reaction.

1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:29.040
 I have a suspicion, I'm kind of a mathematical creature.

1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:34.040
 I was four years old when I first decided that science was what I wanted to do with my life.

1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:44.040
 And so if my personality back then was like it is now, I think it's probably likely I would want to have studied his mathematics.

1:14:44.040 --> 1:14:48.040
 What was a piece of mathematics that he was using to make this prediction?

1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:50.040
 He didn't actually create that mathematics.

1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:53.040
 That mathematics was created roughly 50 years before he lived.

1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:57.040
 He's the person who harnessed it in order to make a prediction.

1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:00.040
 In fact, he had to be taught this mathematics by a friend.

1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:03.040
 So this is in our book.

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:09.040
 So putting myself in that time, I would want to, like I said, I think I would feel excitement.

1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:13.040
 I would want to know what the mathematics is and then I would want to do the calculations myself.

1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:19.040
 Because one thing that physics is all about is that you don't have to take anybody's word for anything.

1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:21.040
 You can do it yourself.

1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:29.040
 It does seem that mathematics is a little bit more tolerant of radical ideas or mathematicians or people who find beauty in mathematics.

1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:33.040
 All the white questions have no good answer.

1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:38.040
 But let me ask, why do you think Einstein never got the Nobel Prize for general relativity?

1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:40.040
 He got it for the photoelectric effect.

1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:41.040
 That is correct.

1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:46.040
 Well, first of all, that's something that is misunderstood about the Nobel Prize in physics.

1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:54.040
 The Nobel Prize in physics is never given for purely proposing an idea.

1:15:54.040 --> 1:16:00.040
 It is always given for proposing an idea that has observational support.

1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:05.040
 So he could not get the Nobel Prize for either special relativity nor general relativity

1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:10.040
 because the provisions that Alfred Nobel left for the award prevent that.

1:16:10.040 --> 1:16:16.040
 But after it's been validated, can he not get it then or no?

1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:21.040
 Yes, but remember the validation doesn't really come until the 1920s.

1:16:21.040 --> 1:16:24.040
 Yeah, but that's why they invented the second Nobel Prize.

1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:31.040
 I mean, Marie Curie, you can get a second Nobel Prize for one of the greatest theories in physics.

1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:33.040
 So let me, let's be clear on this.

1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:42.040
 The theory of general relativity had its critics even up until the 50s.

1:16:42.040 --> 1:16:50.040
 So if you had, if we had, if the committee had wanted to give the prize for general relativity,

1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:56.040
 there were vociferous critics of general relativity up until the 50s.

1:16:56.040 --> 1:16:59.040
 Einstein died in 1955.

1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:05.040
 What lessons do you draw from, from the story you tell in the book, from general relativity,

1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:12.040
 from the radical nature of the theory to looking at the future of string theory?

1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:17.040
 Well, I think that the string theory is probably going to retrace its path,

1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:21.040
 but it's going to be far longer and more torturous in my opinion.

1:17:21.040 --> 1:17:34.040
 String theory is such a broad and deep development that in my opinion, when it becomes acceptable,

1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:40.040
 it's going to be because of a confluence of observations, not going to be a single observation.

1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:46.040
 And I have to tell you that, so I gave a seminar here yesterday at MIT,

1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:54.040
 and it's, it's on an idea I have about how string theory can leave signatures in the cosmic microwave background,

1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:57.040
 which is astrophysical structure.

1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:06.040
 And so if those kinds of observations are borne out, if perhaps other things related to the idea of supersymmetry are borne out,

1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:12.040
 those are going to be the first powerful observationally based pieces of evidence

1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:19.040
 that will begin to do what the Eddington expedition did in 1919.

1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:22.040
 But who, that may take several decades.

1:18:22.040 --> 1:18:26.040
 Do you think there will be Nobel Prizes given for string theory?

1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:27.040
 No.

1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:29.040
 Because decades?

1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:34.040
 Because I think it will exceed normal human lifetimes.

1:18:34.040 --> 1:18:42.040
 But there are other prizes that are given. I mean, there is something called the Breakthrough Prize.

1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:48.040
 There's a Russian immigrant, a Russian American immigrant named Yuri Milner, I believe his name,

1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:52.040
 started this wonderful prize called the Breakthrough Prize.

1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:57.040
 It's three times as much money as the Nobel Prize, and it gets awarded every year.

1:18:57.040 --> 1:19:07.040
 And so something like one of those prizes is likely to be garnered at some point far earlier than a Nobel Award.

1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:09.040
 Jumping around a few topics.

1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:15.040
 While you were at Caltech, you've gotten to interact, I believe, with Richard Feynman.

1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:16.040
 I have to ask.

1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:18.040
 Yes, Richard Feynman, indeed.

1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:21.040
 Do you have any stories that stand out in your memory of that time?

1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:27.040
 I have a fair number of stories, but I'm not prepared to tell them. They're not all politically correct.

1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:30.040
 Let me just say, I'll say the following.

1:19:30.040 --> 1:19:38.040
 Richard Feynman, if you've ever read some of the books about him, in particular, there's a book called Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman.

1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:43.040
 There's a series of books that starts with Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman.

1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:46.040
 And I think the second one may be something like, what do you care what they say?

1:19:46.040 --> 1:19:54.040
 Or something like that. The titles are all there, three of them. When I read those books, I was amazed at how accurately those books

1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:57.040
 portray the man that I interacted with.

1:19:57.040 --> 1:20:03.040
 He was irreverent. He was fun. He was deeply intelligent. He was deeply human.

1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:07.040
 And those books tell that story very effectively.

1:20:07.040 --> 1:20:12.040
 Even just those moments, how did they affect you as a physicist?

1:20:12.040 --> 1:20:20.040
 Well, it's funny because one of the things that I didn't hear Feynman say this,

1:20:20.040 --> 1:20:29.040
 but one of the things that is reported that he said is if you're in a bar stool as a physicist

1:20:29.040 --> 1:20:35.040
 and you can't explain to the guy on the bar stool next to you what you're doing, you don't understand what you're doing.

1:20:35.040 --> 1:20:49.040
 And there's a lot of that that I think is correct, that when you truly understand something as complicated as string theory,

1:20:49.040 --> 1:20:58.040
 when it's in its fully formed final development, it should be something you could tell to the person on the bar stool next to you.

1:20:58.040 --> 1:21:05.040
 And that's something that affects the way I do science, quite frankly.

1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:08.040
 It also affects the way I talk to the public about science.

1:21:08.040 --> 1:21:16.040
 It's one of the sort of my mantras that I keep deeply and try to keep deeply before me when I appear in public fora,

1:21:16.040 --> 1:21:21.040
 speaking about physics in particular and science in general.

1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:24.040
 It's also something that Einstein said in a different way.

1:21:24.040 --> 1:21:31.040
 He said he had these two different formulations, one of them is when the answer is simple is God speaking.

1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:40.040
 And the other thing that he said was that what he did in his work was simply the distillation of common sense,

1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:43.040
 that you distill down to something.

1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:47.040
 And he also said you make things as simple as possible but no simpler.

1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:55.040
 So all of those things and certainly this attitude for me first sort of seeing this was exemplified by being around Richard Feynman.

1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:59.040
 So in all your work, you're always kind of searching for the simplicity for the simple, clear.

1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:00.040
 I am, ultimately.

1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:01.040
 Ultimately I am.

1:22:01.040 --> 1:22:07.040
 You served on President Barack Obama's Council of Advisors in Science and Technology.

1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:08.040
 For seven years, yes.

1:22:08.040 --> 1:22:13.040
 For seven years with Eric Schmidt and several other billion people.

1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:19.040
 Met Eric for the first time in 2009 when the council was called together.

1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:20.040
 Yeah.

1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:21.040
 I've seen pictures of you in that room.

1:22:21.040 --> 1:22:23.040
 I mean, there's a bunch of brilliant people.

1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:24.040
 It kind of looks amazing.

1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:29.040
 What was that experience like being called upon that kind of service?

1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:31.040
 So let me go back to my father first of all.

1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:36.040
 I earlier mentioned that my father served 27 years in the US Army starting in World War II.

1:22:36.040 --> 1:22:42.040
 He went off in 1942, 43 to fight against the fascist.

1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:47.040
 He was part of the supply corps that supplied General Patton as the tanks rolled across

1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:54.040
 Western Europe, pushing back the forces of Nazism to meet up with our Russian comrades

1:22:54.040 --> 1:22:59.040
 who were pushing the Russian, you know, pushing the Nazis starting in Stalingrad.

1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:06.040
 And, you know, the Second World War is actually a very interesting set of piece of history

1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:08.040
 to know from both sides.

1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:12.040
 And here in America, we typically don't, but I've actually studied history as an adult.

1:23:12.040 --> 1:23:14.040
 So I actually know sort of the whole story.

1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:16.040
 And on the Russian side, we don't know the Americans.

1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:18.040
 We weren't taught the American side of the story.

1:23:18.040 --> 1:23:19.040
 I know.

1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:20.040
 I know.

1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:24.040
 I have many Russian friends and we've had this conversation on many occasions.

1:23:24.040 --> 1:23:25.040
 It's fascinating.

1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:28.040
 But you know, like General Zhukov, for example, was something that you wouldn't know about,

1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:31.040
 but you might not know about a Patton, but you're right.

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:37.040
 So Georgiy Zhukov or Rakhisovsky, I mean, there's a whole list of names that I've learned

1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:41.040
 in the last 15 or 20 years looking at the Second World War.

1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:42.040
 So...

1:23:42.040 --> 1:23:46.040
 Your father was in the midst of that, probably one of the greatest wars in history.

1:23:46.040 --> 1:23:49.040
 In the history of our species.

1:23:49.040 --> 1:23:57.040
 And so the idea of service comes to me essentially from that example.

1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:08.040
 So in 2009, when I first got a call from a Nobel laureate actually in biology, Harold

1:24:08.040 --> 1:24:12.040
 Farmers, it was on my way to India.

1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:15.040
 And I got this email message and he said it needed to talk to me.

1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:16.040
 And I said, okay, fine.

1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:17.040
 We can talk.

1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:18.040
 I got back to states.

1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:20.040
 I didn't hear from him.

1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:22.040
 We went through several cycles of this sending me a message.

1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:25.040
 I would have talked to you and then he never contacted.

1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:29.040
 Finally, I was on my way to give a physics presentation at the University of Florida

1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:36.040
 in Gainesville and just that stepped off a plane and my mobile phone went off and it

1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:37.040
 was Harold.

1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:41.400
 And so I said, Harold, why do you keep sending me messages that you want to talk but you

1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:42.400
 never call?

1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:47.040
 And he said, well, I'm sorry, things have been hectic and da, da, da, da, da.

1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:52.800
 And then he said, if you were offered the opportunity to serve on the U.S. President's

1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:59.400
 Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, what would be your answer?

1:24:59.400 --> 1:25:04.960
 I was amused at the formulation of the question because it's clear that there's a purpose

1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:07.760
 of why the question is asked that way.

1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:12.680
 But then he made it clear to me he wasn't joking.

1:25:12.680 --> 1:25:18.480
 And literally one of the few times in my life, my knees went weak and I had to hold myself

1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:23.080
 up against a wall so that I didn't fall over.

1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:31.920
 I doubt if most of us who have been the beneficiaries of the benefits of this country, when given

1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:34.960
 that kind of opportunity could say no.

1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:37.760
 And I know I certainly couldn't say no.

1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:47.480
 I was frightened out of my wits because I had never, although I have my, my career in

1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:52.880
 terms of policy recommendations is actually quite long, goes back to the 80s, but I had

1:25:52.880 --> 1:26:05.960
 never been called upon to serve as an advisor to a President of the United States.

1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:11.880
 And it was very scary, but I did not feel that I could say no because I wouldn't be

1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:19.080
 able to sleep with myself at night saying, you know, that I chickened out or whatever.

1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:23.720
 And so I took the plunge and we had a pretty good run.

1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:30.640
 There are things that I did in those seven years of which I'm extraordinarily proud.

1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:35.120
 One of the ways I tell people is if you've ever seen that television cartoon called Schoolhouse

1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:39.240
 Rock is this one story about how Bill becomes a law.

1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:40.720
 And I've kind of lived that.

1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:46.800
 There are things that I did that have now been codified in US law.

1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:50.000
 Not everybody gets a chance to do things like that in life.

1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:56.160
 What do you think is the science and technology, especially in American politics, you know,

1:26:56.160 --> 1:27:00.600
 we haven't had a President who's an engineer or a scientist.

1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:05.840
 What do you think is the role of a President like President Obama in understanding the

1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:07.600
 latest ideas in science and tech?

1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:08.960
 What was that experience like?

1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:12.800
 Well, first of all, I've met other Presidents beside President Obama.

1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:18.120
 He is the most extraordinary President I've ever encountered.

1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:21.640
 Despite the fact that he went to Harvard.

1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:27.840
 When I think about President Obama, he is a deep mystery to me in the same way perhaps

1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:30.080
 that the universe is a mystery.

1:27:30.080 --> 1:27:36.040
 I don't really understand how that constellation of personalities, personality traits could

1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:41.080
 come to fit within a per single individual, but I saw them for seven years.

1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:44.120
 So I'm convinced that I wasn't seeing fake news.

1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:45.280
 I was seeing real data.

1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:48.080
 He was just an extraordinary man.

1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:58.680
 And one of the things that was completely clear was that he was not afraid and not intimidated

1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:01.200
 to be in a room of really smart people.

1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:09.880
 I mean, really smart people that he was completely comfortable in asking some of the world's

1:28:09.880 --> 1:28:12.960
 greatest experts, what do I do about this problem?

1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:18.840
 And it wasn't that he was going to just take their answer, but he would listen to the advice.

1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:21.360
 And that to me was extraordinary.

1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:27.360
 As I said, I've been around other executives and I've never seen one quite like him.

1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:33.320
 He's an extraordinary learner is what I observed and not just about science.

1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:38.720
 He has a way of internalizing information in real time that I've never seen in a politician

1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:42.840
 before, even in extraordinarily complicated situations.

1:28:42.840 --> 1:28:44.440
 Even scientific ideas.

1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:45.840
 Scientific or non scientific.

1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:48.240
 Complicated ideas don't have to be scientific ideas.

1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:52.400
 But I have, like I said, seen him in real time process complicated ideas with a speed

1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:54.400
 that was stunning.

1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:56.560
 In fact, he shocked the entire council.

1:28:56.560 --> 1:29:06.560
 I mean, we were all stunned at his capacity to be presented with complicated ideas and

1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:11.800
 then to wrestle with him and internalize them and then come back more interestingly enough,

1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:14.200
 come back with really good questions to ask.

1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:19.520
 I've noticed this in the area that I understand more of artificial intelligence.

1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:24.520
 I've seen him integrate information about artificial intelligence and then come out with

1:29:24.520 --> 1:29:27.760
 these kind of Richard Feynman like insights.

1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:28.760
 That's exactly right.

1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:33.400
 And that's, that's, as I said, those of us who have been in that position, it is stunning

1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:36.280
 to see it happen because you don't expect it.

1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:37.280
 Yeah.

1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:42.000
 It takes what for a lot of sort of graduates who takes like four years in a particular

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:46.880
 topic and just does it in a few minutes, like very naturally.

1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:51.120
 You've mentioned that you would love to see experimental validation of super strength

1:29:51.120 --> 1:29:53.560
 theory before you.

1:29:53.560 --> 1:29:56.680
 You would shuffle off this mortal coil.

1:29:56.680 --> 1:30:00.760
 Which the poetry of that reference made me smile when I saw it.

1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:04.120
 You know, people will actually misunderstand it because it's not what, it doesn't mean

1:30:04.120 --> 1:30:08.480
 what we generally take it to mean colloquially, but it's such a beautiful expression.

1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:09.480
 Yeah, it is.

1:30:09.480 --> 1:30:15.360
 It's from the Hamlet to be or not to be speech, which I still don't understand what that's

1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:18.240
 about, but so many interpretations.

1:30:18.240 --> 1:30:24.760
 Anyway, the, what are the most exciting problems in physics that are just within our reach

1:30:24.760 --> 1:30:29.520
 of understanding and maybe solve the next few decades that you may be able to see?

1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:36.240
 So in physics, you limited it to physics, physics, mathematics, this kind of space of

1:30:36.240 --> 1:30:38.640
 problems that fascinated you.

1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:43.400
 Well, the one that looks on the immediate horizon, like we're going to get to is quantum

1:30:43.400 --> 1:30:45.840
 computing.

1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:50.960
 And that's going to, if we actually get there, that's going to be extraordinarily interesting.

1:30:50.960 --> 1:30:56.280
 Do you think that's a fundamentally problem of theory or is it now in the space of engineering?

1:30:56.280 --> 1:30:57.360
 It's in the space of engineering.

1:30:57.360 --> 1:31:05.920
 I was out at Q station, as you may know, Microsoft has this research facility in Santa

1:31:05.920 --> 1:31:06.920
 Barbara.

1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:12.960
 I was out there a couple of months in my capacity as vice president of American Physical Society.

1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:16.440
 And I got it, you know, I had some things that were like lectures and they were telling

1:31:16.440 --> 1:31:20.880
 me what they were doing, and it sure sounded like they knew what they were doing and that

1:31:20.880 --> 1:31:23.360
 they were close to major breakthroughs.

1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:29.920
 Yeah, that's a really exciting possibility there, but the back to Hamlet.

1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:32.960
 Do you ponder mortality, your own mortality?

1:31:32.960 --> 1:31:33.960
 Nope.

1:31:33.960 --> 1:31:36.440
 My mother died when I was 11 years old.

1:31:36.440 --> 1:31:42.920
 And so I immediately knew what the end of the story was for all of us.

1:31:42.920 --> 1:31:48.080
 As a consequence, I've never, never spent a lot of time thinking about death.

1:31:48.080 --> 1:31:55.000
 It'll come in its own good time and sort of, to me, the job of every human is to make the

1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:02.680
 best and the most of the time that's given to us in order, not for our own selfish gain,

1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:09.200
 but to try to make this place a better place for someone else.

1:32:09.200 --> 1:32:13.680
 And on the why of life, why do you think we are?

1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:14.680
 I have no idea.

1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:17.800
 And I never even worried about it.

1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:21.240
 For me, I have an answer, a local answer.

1:32:21.240 --> 1:32:25.400
 The apparent why for me was because I'm supposed to do physics.

1:32:25.400 --> 1:32:31.600
 But it's funny because there's so many other quantum mechanically speaking possibilities

1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:36.600
 in your life, such as being an astronaut, for example, if you're born if you're born

1:32:36.600 --> 1:32:49.360
 that I see, well, like, like Einstein and the vicissitudes that prevented the 1914 measurement

1:32:49.360 --> 1:32:55.200
 of starlight bending, the universe is constructed in such a way that I didn't become an astronaut,

1:32:55.200 --> 1:33:02.440
 which would have, for me, I would have faced the worst choice in my life, whether, whether

1:33:02.440 --> 1:33:07.640
 I would try to become an astronaut or whether I would try to do theoretical physics.

1:33:07.640 --> 1:33:11.720
 Both of these dreams are born when I was four years old simultaneously.

1:33:11.720 --> 1:33:17.160
 And so I can't imagine how difficult that decision would have been.

1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:19.720
 The universe helped you out on that one.

1:33:19.720 --> 1:33:21.840
 Not only in that one, but in many ones.

1:33:21.840 --> 1:33:25.520
 It helped me out by allowing me to pick the right dad.

1:33:25.520 --> 1:33:30.000
 Is there a day in your life you could relive because it made you truly happy?

1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:31.000
 What day would that be?

1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:33.400
 You could just look back.

1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:39.000
 Being a theoretical physicist is like having Christmas every day.

1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:43.280
 I have lots of joy in my life.

1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:47.840
 The moments of invention, the moments of ideas, revelation, yes.

1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:53.520
 The only thing I see them are some family experiences like when my kids were born and

1:33:53.520 --> 1:33:57.880
 that kind of stuff, but they're pretty high up there.

1:33:57.880 --> 1:34:00.680
 Well, I don't see a better way to end it, Jim.

1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:01.680
 Thank you so much.

1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:03.520
 It was a huge honor talking to you today.

1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:05.680
 This worked out better than I thought.

1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:08.680
 Glad to hear it.

1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:42.880
 the rebels among us.

1:34:42.880 --> 1:34:48.320
 Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.
