00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
 The following is a conversation with Michael Minna.

00:02.480 --> 00:08.080
 He's a professor at Harvard doing research on infectious disease and immunology.

00:08.080 --> 00:12.240
 The most defining characteristic of his approach to science and biology

00:12.240 --> 00:15.920
 is that of a first principles thinker and engineer focused

00:15.920 --> 00:20.080
 not just on defining the problem but finding the solution.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.920
 In that spirit we talk about cheap rapid at home testing,

00:23.920 --> 00:28.720
 which is a solution to COVID 19 that to me has become one of the most obvious,

00:28.720 --> 00:34.240
 powerful and doable solutions that frankly should have been done months ago and still

00:34.240 --> 00:40.320
 should be done now. As we talk about its accuracy is high for detecting actual contagiousness

00:40.320 --> 00:44.560
 and hundreds of millions can be manufactured quickly and relatively cheaply.

00:44.560 --> 00:50.480
 In general I love engineering solutions like these even if government bureaucracies often don't.

00:51.200 --> 00:56.640
 It respects science and data, it respects our freedom, it respects our intelligence

00:56.640 --> 01:00.480
 and basic common sense. Quick mention of his sponsor,

01:00.480 --> 01:04.560
 followed by some thoughts related to the episode. Thank you to Brave,

01:31.520 --> 01:38.080
 I've always been solution oriented, not problem oriented. It saddens me to see that public discourse

01:38.080 --> 01:44.160
 disproportionately focuses on the mistakes of those who dare to build solutions rather than

01:44.160 --> 01:50.160
 applaud their attempt to do so. Teddy Roosevelt said it well in his The Man in the Arena speech

01:50.160 --> 01:56.080
 over 100 years ago. I should say that both the critic and the creator are important.

01:56.640 --> 02:02.880
 But in my humble estimation, there are too many now of the former and not enough of the latter.

02:03.440 --> 02:09.440
 So while we spread the derisive words of the critic on social media making it viral,

02:10.000 --> 02:16.800
 let's not forget that this world is built on the blood, sweat, and tears of those who dare to create.

02:27.920 --> 02:35.040
 And now here's my conversation with Michael Mina. What is the most beautiful, mysterious,

02:35.040 --> 02:41.600
 or surprising idea in the biology of humans or viruses that you ever come across in your work?

02:41.600 --> 02:43.520
 Sorry for the overly philosophical question.

02:43.520 --> 02:50.560
 Wow. Well, that's a great question. You know, I love the pathogenesis of viruses and

02:52.640 --> 02:59.920
 one of the things that I've worked on a lot is trying to understand how viruses interact with

02:59.920 --> 03:08.720
 each other. And so pre all this COVID stuff, I was really, really dedicated to understanding

03:08.720 --> 03:18.320
 how viruses impact other pathogens. So how if somebody gets an infection with one thing or a

03:18.320 --> 03:26.240
 vaccine, does it either benefit or harm you from other things that appear to be unrelated to most

03:26.240 --> 03:33.840
 people? And so one system which is highly detrimental to humans, but what I think is just

03:33.840 --> 03:42.240
 immensely fascinating is measles. And measles gets into a kid's body. The immune system picks it up

03:43.040 --> 03:51.680
 and essentially grabs the virus and does exactly what it's supposed to do, which is to take this

03:51.680 --> 03:55.600
 virus and bring it into the immune system so that the immune system can learn from it,

03:56.240 --> 04:01.520
 can develop an immune response to it. But instead, measles plays a trick. It gets into the immune

04:01.520 --> 04:08.640
 system, serves almost as a Trojan horse. And instead of getting eaten by these cells, it just

04:08.640 --> 04:14.160
 takes them over and it ends up proliferating in the very cells that were supposed to kill it.

04:15.280 --> 04:20.720
 And it just distributes throughout the entire body, gets into the bone marrow, kills off children's

04:20.720 --> 04:27.360
 immune memories. And so it essentially, what I've found and what my research has found is that

04:27.360 --> 04:34.160
 this one virus was responsible for as much as half of all of the infectious disease deaths in kids

04:34.160 --> 04:37.520
 before we started vaccinating against it because it was just wiping out

04:38.160 --> 04:44.960
 children's immune memories to all different pathogens, which is, I think, just astounding.

04:44.960 --> 04:50.560
 It's just amazing to watch it spread throughout bodies. We've done the studies in monkeys and

04:50.560 --> 04:55.440
 you can watch it just destroy and obliterate people's immune memories in the same way that

04:55.440 --> 05:03.760
 some parasite might destroy somebody's brain. Is that an evolutionary coincidence or is there

05:03.760 --> 05:10.160
 some kind of advantage to this kind of interactivity between pathogens? I think in that sense it's

05:10.160 --> 05:22.000
 just coincidence. It's a good way for measles to essentially be able to survive long enough to

05:22.000 --> 05:26.320
 replicate in the body. It just replicates in the cells that are meant to destroy it.

05:26.320 --> 05:33.680
 So it's utilizing our immune cells for its own replication, but in so doing, it's destroying

05:33.680 --> 05:38.800
 the memories of all the other immunological memories. But there are other viruses, so a

05:38.800 --> 05:49.120
 different system is influenza and flu predisposes to severe bacterial infections. And that, I think,

05:49.120 --> 05:56.000
 is another coincidence. But I also think that there are some evolutionary benefits that bacteria

05:56.000 --> 06:02.800
 may hijack and piggyback on viral infections. Viruses, they just grow so much quicker than

06:02.800 --> 06:09.040
 bacteria. They replicate faster. And so there's the system with viruses, with flu and bacteria,

06:09.040 --> 06:16.320
 where the influenza has these proteins that cleave certain receptors. And the bacteria

06:16.320 --> 06:20.720
 want to cleave those same receptors. They want to cleave the same molecules that give entrance to

06:20.720 --> 06:26.400
 those receptors. So instead, the bacteria found out like, hey, you know, we could just piggyback

06:26.400 --> 06:32.400
 on these viruses. They'll do it a hundred or a thousand times faster than we can. And so then

06:32.400 --> 06:38.000
 they just piggyback on and they let flu cleave all these sialic acids. And then the bacteria just

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
 glom on in the wake of it. So there's all different interactions between pathogens that are just

06:44.000 --> 06:50.320
 remarkable. So does this whole system of viruses that interact with each other and so damn good at

06:50.320 --> 06:56.480
 getting inside our bodies, does that fascinate you or terrify you? I'm very much a scientist. And so

06:57.120 --> 07:03.600
 it fascinates me much more than terrifies me. But knowing enough, I know just how well, you know,

07:03.600 --> 07:10.320
 we get the wrong virus in our population, whether it's through some random mutation or

07:10.320 --> 07:15.440
 whether it's this same COVID 19 virus. And these things are tricky. They're able to

07:16.240 --> 07:22.480
 mutate quickly. They're able to find new hosts and rearrange in the case of influenza.

07:23.920 --> 07:29.200
 So what terrifies me is just how easily this particular pandemic could have been so much

07:29.200 --> 07:35.200
 worse. This could have been a virus that is much worse than it is. You know, same thing with H1N1

07:35.200 --> 07:43.280
 back in 2009. That terrifies me. If a virus like that was much more detrimental, you know, that

07:43.280 --> 07:48.880
 would be, it could be much more devastating. Although it's hard to say, you know, the human

07:48.880 --> 07:56.400
 species were worth, well, I hesitate to say that we're good at responding to things because there

07:56.400 --> 08:03.920
 are some aspects that were, this particular virus, SARS COVID 2 and COVID 19 has found a sweet spot

08:03.920 --> 08:08.320
 where it's not quite serious enough on an individual level that humans just don't,

08:09.040 --> 08:15.840
 we haven't seen much of a useful response by many humans. A lot of people even think it's a hoax.

08:15.840 --> 08:22.240
 And so it's led us down this path of, it's not quite serious enough to get everyone to respond

08:22.240 --> 08:27.520
 immediately and with the most urgency, but it's enough, it's bad enough that, you know, it's

08:27.520 --> 08:34.160
 caused our economies to shut down and collapse. And so I think I know enough about virus biology to

08:34.160 --> 08:40.720
 be terrified for humans that, you know, it can, it just takes one virus, just takes the wrong one

08:40.720 --> 08:45.680
 to just obliterate us or not obliterate us, but really do much more damage than we've seen.

08:45.680 --> 08:51.360
 It's fascinating to think that COVID 19 is a result of a virus evolving together with like

08:51.360 --> 08:57.120
 Twitter, like figuring out how we can sneak past the defenses of the humans. So it's not

08:57.120 --> 09:03.280
 bad enough. And then the misinformation, all that kind of stuff together is operating in such a

09:03.280 --> 09:10.160
 way that the virus can spread effectively. I wonder, I mean, obviously a virus is not intelligent,

09:10.160 --> 09:18.080
 but there's a, there's a rhyme and a rhythm to the way this whole evolutionary process works

09:18.080 --> 09:21.760
 and creates these fascinating things that spread throughout the entire civilization.

09:21.760 --> 09:33.600
 Absolutely. It's, yeah, I'm completely fascinated by this idea of social media in particular,

09:33.600 --> 09:39.920
 how it replicates, how it grows, you know, I've been, how it, how it actually starts interacting

09:39.920 --> 09:46.480
 with the biology of the virus, masks, who's going to get vaccinated, politics, like these seem so

09:46.480 --> 09:55.040
 external to virus biology, but it's become so intertwined. And, and it's, it's interesting.

09:55.040 --> 10:01.280
 And I actually think we could find out that, you know, the virus actually becomes obviously not

10:02.720 --> 10:07.760
 intentionally, but, you know, we could find that choosing people choosing not to wear masks,

10:07.760 --> 10:15.120
 choosing not to counter this virus in a regimented and sort of organized way effectively gives the

10:15.120 --> 10:22.640
 virus more opportunity to escape. We can look at vaccines, you know, we're about to, we're about

10:22.640 --> 10:28.080
 to have one of the most aggressive vaccination programs the world has ever seen. But we are

10:28.080 --> 10:33.920
 unfortunately doing it right at the peak of viral transmission when millions and millions of people

10:33.920 --> 10:40.400
 are still getting infected. And when we do that, that just gives this virus so many more opportunities.

10:40.400 --> 10:46.720
 I mean, orders of magnitude, more opportunity to mutate around our immune system. Now, if we were

10:46.720 --> 10:52.240
 to vaccinate everyone when there's not a lot of virus, then there's just not a lot of virus. And so

10:52.240 --> 10:57.280
 there's not going to be as many, you know, I don't even know how many zeros are at the end of however

10:57.280 --> 11:01.760
 many viral particles there are in the world right now, you know, more than quadrillions, you know,

11:02.640 --> 11:07.200
 and so if you assume that at any given time, somebody might have trillions of virus in them

11:07.200 --> 11:12.000
 and at any given individual. So then, you know, multiply trillions by millions. And, you know,

11:12.000 --> 11:17.120
 you get a lot of viruses out there. And if you start applying pressure, ecological pressure to

11:18.000 --> 11:24.480
 this virus that that, you know, when it's not abundant, kind of opportunity for a virus to

11:24.480 --> 11:29.040
 sneak around immunity, especially when all the vaccines are identical, essentially.

11:30.320 --> 11:35.520
 All it takes is one to mutate and then jumps. Oh, takes one takes one in the whole world, you

11:35.520 --> 11:42.000
 know, and we have to, we have to not forget that this particular virus was one, it was one opportunity

11:42.000 --> 11:46.160
 and it has spread across the globe and there's no reason that can't happen tomorrow. I knew,

11:46.160 --> 11:52.080
 you know, it's scary. I have a million other questions in this direction, but I'd love to

11:52.080 --> 12:00.560
 talk about one of the most exciting aspects of your work, which is testing or rapid testing.

12:00.560 --> 12:08.800
 You wrote a great article in time on November 17th. This is like a month ago about rapid testing

12:08.800 --> 12:14.960
 titled, How we can stop the spread of COVID 19 by Christmas. Let's jot down the fact that this

12:14.960 --> 12:19.600
 is a month ago. So maybe your timeline would be different, but let's say in a month. So you've

12:19.600 --> 12:26.080
 talked about this powerful idea for quite a while throughout the COVID 19 pandemic. How do we stop

12:26.080 --> 12:34.400
 the spread of COVID 19 in a month? Well, we use tests like these. You know, so the only reason

12:34.400 --> 12:41.200
 the virus continues spreading is because people spread it to each other. This isn't magic. Yes.

12:42.000 --> 12:49.840
 And so there's a few ways to stop the virus from spreading to each other. And that is you either

12:49.840 --> 12:56.240
 can vaccinate everyone and vaccinating everyone is a way to immunologically prevent the virus from

12:56.240 --> 13:01.360
 growing inside of somebody and therefore spreading. We don't know yet actually if this vaccine, if any

13:01.360 --> 13:08.640
 of these vaccines are going to prevent onward transmission. So that may or may not serve to

13:08.640 --> 13:13.600
 be one opportunity. Certainly, I think it will decrease transmission. But the other idea that

13:13.600 --> 13:19.920
 we have at our disposal now, we had it in May, we had it in June, July, August, September, October,

13:19.920 --> 13:26.080
 November. And now it's December. We still have it. We still choose not to use it in this country and

13:26.080 --> 13:31.920
 in much of the world. And that's rapid testing that is giving it's empowering people to know

13:33.120 --> 13:38.160
 that they are infected and giving them the opportunity to not spread it to their loved ones

13:38.160 --> 13:44.640
 and their friends and neighbors and whoever else. We could have done this. We still can.

13:44.640 --> 13:51.760
 Today we could start. We have millions of these tests. These tests are simple paper strip tests.

13:51.760 --> 13:59.440
 They are inside of this thing is just a little piece of paper. Now, and I can actually open it

13:59.440 --> 14:06.960
 up here. There we go. So this, this is how we do it right here. We have this little paper strip test.

14:06.960 --> 14:12.640
 This is enough to let you know if you're infectious with somewhere around the order of 99%

14:12.640 --> 14:20.320
 sensitivity, 99% specificity, you can know if you have infectious virus in you. If we can get these

14:20.320 --> 14:25.440
 out to everyone's homes, build these, make 10 million, 20 million, 30 million of them a day.

14:25.440 --> 14:31.520
 You know, we make more bottles of Desani water every day. We can make these little paper strip

14:31.520 --> 14:37.200
 tests. And if we do that and we get these into people's homes so that they can use them twice a

14:37.200 --> 14:43.520
 week, then we can know if we're infectious, you know, is it perfect? Absolutely not. But is it

14:43.520 --> 14:50.080
 near perfect? Absolutely. You know, and so if we can say, hey, the, the, the transmission of this is,

14:50.080 --> 14:56.320
 you know, for every 100 people that get infected right now, they go on to infect maybe 130 additional

14:56.320 --> 15:02.400
 people. And that's exponential growth. So 100 becomes 130. A couple of days later, that 130

15:02.400 --> 15:10.640
 becomes another 165 people have now been infected and, you know, go over three weeks and 100 people

15:10.640 --> 15:17.920
 become 500 people infected. Now, it doesn't take much to have those 100 people not infect 130,

15:17.920 --> 15:25.040
 but infect 90. All we have to do is remove, say, 30, 40% of new infections from continuing their

15:25.040 --> 15:30.720
 spread. And then instead of exponential growth, you have exponential decay. So this doesn't need

15:30.720 --> 15:35.520
 to be perfect. We don't have to go from 100 to zero. We just have to go and have those 100 people

15:35.520 --> 15:42.320
 infect 90 and those 90 people infect, you know, 82, whatever it might be. And you do that for a few

15:42.320 --> 15:47.760
 weeks and boom, you have now gone instead of 100 to 500, you've gone from 100 to 20. Yes. It's not

15:47.760 --> 15:55.440
 very hard. And so the way to do that is to let people know that they're infectious. I mean,

15:55.440 --> 16:02.400
 I, we're a perfect example right now. I this morning, I use these tests to make sure that I

16:02.400 --> 16:08.480
 wasn't infectious. Is it perfect? No, but it reduced my odds 99%. I already was at extremely low odds

16:08.480 --> 16:12.720
 because I spent my life quarantining these days. Well, the interesting thing with this test,

16:12.720 --> 16:17.760
 with testing in general, which is why I love what you've been espousing. And it's really

16:17.760 --> 16:26.480
 confusing to me that this has not been taken on as it's one, an actual solution that's those

16:26.480 --> 16:34.400
 available for a long time. There's, there doesn't seem to have been solutions proposed at a large

16:34.400 --> 16:39.360
 scale and a solution that it seems like a lot of people would be able to get behind. There's some

16:39.360 --> 16:46.400
 politicization or fear of other solutions that people have proposed, which is like lockdown.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.560
 And there's a worry, you know, especially in the American spirit of freedom,

16:50.560 --> 16:57.280
 like you can't tell me what to do. The thing about tests is it like empowers you with

16:57.280 --> 17:05.120
 information essentially. So like you, it's, it gives you more information about your,

17:05.120 --> 17:11.040
 like your role in this pandemic. And then you can do whatever the hell you want. Like it's all

17:11.040 --> 17:17.200
 up to your ethics and so on. So like, and it's obvious that with that information, people would

17:17.200 --> 17:23.920
 be able to protect their loved ones and also do, do their sort of quote unquote duty for their

17:23.920 --> 17:28.640
 country, right? It's protect the rest of the country. That's exactly right. I mean, it's just,

17:29.360 --> 17:34.400
 it's empowerment. But you know, this is a problem. We have not put these into action

17:34.400 --> 17:41.440
 in large part because we have a medical industry that doesn't want to see them be used. We have a

17:41.440 --> 17:46.400
 political and a regulatory industry that doesn't want to see them be used. That sounds crazy.

17:46.400 --> 17:51.760
 Why wouldn't they want them to be used? We have a very paternalistic approach to everything in

17:51.760 --> 17:58.160
 this country. You know, despite this country kind of being founded on this individualistic ideal,

17:58.160 --> 18:03.040
 pull yourself up from your bootstraps, all that stuff. When it comes to public health,

18:03.040 --> 18:10.720
 we have a bunch of ivory tower academics who want data. They, you know, they want to see

18:10.720 --> 18:17.600
 perfection. And we have this issue of letting perfection get in the way of actually doing

18:17.600 --> 18:24.240
 something at all, you know, doing something effective. And so we keep comparing these tests,

18:24.240 --> 18:31.200
 for example, to the laboratory based PCR test. And sure, this isn't a PCR test, but this doesn't

18:31.200 --> 18:36.640
 cost $100 and it doesn't take five days to get back, which means in every single scenario,

18:36.640 --> 18:42.560
 this is the more effective test. And we have, unfortunately, a system that's not about public

18:42.560 --> 18:50.640
 health. We have entirely eroded any ideals of public health in our country for the biomedical

18:50.640 --> 18:55.920
 complex, you know, this medical industrial complex, which overrides everything. And that's why, you

18:55.920 --> 19:05.680
 know, I'm just, can I swear on this pot? Yes. I'm just so fucking pissed that these tests don't

19:05.680 --> 19:10.480
 exist. Meanwhile, and everyone says, you know, oh, we couldn't make these, you know, that we could

19:10.480 --> 19:17.280
 never do it. That would be such a hard, a difficult problem. Meanwhile, the vaccine gets, we have,

19:17.280 --> 19:20.720
 at the same time that we could have gotten these stupid little paper strip tests out to every

19:20.720 --> 19:27.200
 household. We have developed a brand new vaccine. We've gone through phase one, phase two, phase

19:27.200 --> 19:32.800
 three trials. We've scaled up its production. And now we have UPS and FedEx and all the logistics in

19:32.800 --> 19:37.760
 the world getting freezers out to where they need to be. We have this immense, we see what,

19:37.760 --> 19:41.520
 when it comes to sort of medicine, you know, something you're injecting into somebody,

19:42.240 --> 19:47.360
 then all of a sudden people say, oh, yes, we can. But you say, oh, no, that's, that's too

19:47.360 --> 19:52.880
 simple a solution, too cheap a solution. No way could we possibly do that. It's this faulty

19:52.880 --> 19:58.960
 thinking in our country, which, you know, frankly is driven by big money, big, you know,

19:58.960 --> 20:03.440
 the only time when we actually think that we can do something that's maybe aggressive and

20:03.440 --> 20:07.920
 complicated is when there's billions and billions of billions of dollars in it, you know. And,

20:07.920 --> 20:11.440
 I mean, in a difficult note, because this is part of your work from before the COVID,

20:11.440 --> 20:19.040
 but it does seem that I saw statistic currently is that 40% would not be taken of Americans would

20:19.040 --> 20:23.920
 not be taken a vaccine. Some number like this. So you also have to acknowledge that all the money

20:23.920 --> 20:30.240
 that's been invested, like there doesn't appear to be a solution to deal with like the fear and

20:30.240 --> 20:36.320
 distrust that people have. I bet, I don't know if you know this number, but for taking a strip,

20:36.320 --> 20:42.320
 like a rapid test like this, I bet you people would say like the percentage of people that

20:42.320 --> 20:47.520
 wouldn't take it is in the single digits probably. I completely think so. And, you know, there's a

20:47.520 --> 20:52.080
 lot of people who don't want to get a test today. And that's because it gets sent to a lab,

20:52.960 --> 20:59.360
 it gets reported, it has all the stuff and we're a country which teaches people from the time

20:59.360 --> 21:05.520
 they're babies, you know, to keep their medical data close to them. We have HIPAA, we have all

21:05.520 --> 21:10.720
 these, we have immense rules and regulations to ensure the privacy of people's medical data.

21:11.440 --> 21:15.680
 And then a pandemic comes around and we just assume that all that the average person is going

21:15.680 --> 21:20.400
 to wipe all of that away and say, oh, no, I'm happy giving out not just my own medical data,

21:20.400 --> 21:25.840
 but also to tell the authority is everyone who I've spent my time with so that they all get a call

21:25.840 --> 21:30.080
 and are pissed at me for giving up their names. You know, so people aren't getting tested and

21:30.080 --> 21:35.360
 they're definitely not giving up their contacts when it comes to contact tracing. And so for

21:35.360 --> 21:41.360
 so many reasons that approach is failing, not to even mention the delays in testing and things

21:41.360 --> 21:46.880
 like that. And so this is a whole different approach, but it's an approach that empowers people

21:46.880 --> 21:52.880
 and takes the power a bit away from the people in charge, you know, and that's what's really

21:52.880 --> 21:58.560
 grating on, I think, public health officials who say, no, we need the data. So they're effectively

21:58.560 --> 22:03.120
 saying, if I can't have the data, I don't want the individuals, I don't want the public to have

22:03.120 --> 22:08.480
 their own data either, which is a terrible approach to a pandemic where we can't solve

22:08.480 --> 22:15.680
 a public health crisis without actively engaging the public. It just doesn't work. And, you know,

22:15.680 --> 22:19.040
 and that's what we're trying to do right now, which is a terrible approach.

22:19.040 --> 22:23.680
 So first of all, there's, you have a really nice informed website rapidtest.org

22:23.680 --> 22:27.840
 with information on this. I still can't believe this is not more popular. It's ridiculous. Okay,

22:27.840 --> 22:38.320
 but our one of the FAQs you have is a rapid test too expensive. So can cost be brought down? Like,

22:38.320 --> 22:45.440
 I pay, I take a weekly PCR test and I think I pay 160, 170 bucks a week.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
 No, I mean, it's criminal. Absolutely, we can get costs. This thing right here costs less than a

22:52.000 --> 22:58.880
 dollar to make with everything combined plus the swabs, you know, maybe a cost $1.50 could be sold

22:58.880 --> 23:04.560
 for, frankly, it could be sold for $3 and still make a profit if they want to sell it for five,

23:04.560 --> 23:11.440
 this one here. This is a slightly more complicated one, but you can see it's just got the exact

23:11.440 --> 23:16.160
 same paper strip inside. And this is really, it doesn't look like much, but it's kind of the

23:16.160 --> 23:20.720
 cream of the crop in terms of these rapid tests. This is the one that the US government bought

23:20.720 --> 23:28.400
 and it is doing an amazing job. It has a 99.9% sensitivity and specificity. So it's really,

23:28.400 --> 23:34.000
 it's really good. And so essentially the way it works is you just, you use a swab, you put the,

23:34.000 --> 23:38.080
 once you, you kind of use a swab in yourself, you put the swab into these little holes here,

23:38.800 --> 23:44.480
 you put some buffer on it and you close it and a line will show up if it's positive and a line

23:44.480 --> 23:51.280
 won't show up, but it's negative and it takes five, 10 minutes. This whole thing, this can be made

23:51.280 --> 23:58.320
 so cheap that the US government was able to buy them, buy 150 million of them from Abbott for

23:58.320 --> 24:04.480
 $5 a piece. You know, so anyone who says that these are expensive, we have the proof is right here.

24:05.040 --> 24:11.440
 This one at its, you know, was, Abbott did not lose money on this deal. You know, they got $750

24:11.440 --> 24:18.560
 million for buying, for selling 150 million of these at five bucks a piece. All of these tests

24:18.560 --> 24:23.600
 can do the same. So anyone who says that these should be, you know, unfortunately what's happening

24:23.600 --> 24:29.920
 though is the FDA is only authorizing all of these tests as medical devices. So what happens when you,

24:29.920 --> 24:35.600
 if I'm a medical company, if I'm, if I'm a test production company and I want to make this test

24:35.600 --> 24:42.480
 and I go through and the FDA at the end of my authorization, the FDA says, okay, you know,

24:42.480 --> 24:47.840
 you now have a medical device, not a public health tool, but a medical device and that

24:47.840 --> 24:55.280
 affords you the ability to charge insurance companies for it. Why would I ever as a, you know,

24:55.280 --> 25:01.840
 in our capitalistic economy and sort of infrastructure, why would I ever not sell this

25:01.840 --> 25:09.200
 for $30 when insurance will pay for it or $100? You know, it might only cost me 50 cents to make,

25:09.200 --> 25:15.040
 but, but by pushing all of these tests through a medical pathway at the FDA, they, what, what

25:15.040 --> 25:20.560
 extrudes out the other side is an expensive medical device that's erroneously expensive. It doesn't

25:20.560 --> 25:27.280
 need to be inflated in cost, but the companies say, well, I'd rather make fewer of them and just

25:27.280 --> 25:34.560
 sell them all for $30 a piece than make tens of millions of them, which I could do and sell them

25:34.560 --> 25:42.800
 at a, at a dollar marginal profit. You know, and so it's a problem with our, with our whole

25:42.800 --> 25:48.240
 medical industry that we see tests only as medical devices and you know, what I would like to see

25:48.240 --> 25:52.160
 is for the government in the same way that they bought 150 million of these from Abbott,

25:52.160 --> 25:58.400
 they should be buying, you know, all of these tests that they should be buying 20 million a day

25:58.960 --> 26:03.920
 and getting them out to people's homes. This virus has cost trillions of dollars to the American

26:03.920 --> 26:09.280
 people. It's closed down restaurants and stores and, you know, obviously the main streets across

26:09.280 --> 26:14.800
 America have shut, have shuttered. It's killing people. It's killing our economy. It's killing

26:14.800 --> 26:21.040
 lifestyles and, and this is an obvious solution. To me, this is exciting. This is like, this is

26:21.040 --> 26:28.000
 a solution. I wish, uh, like in April or something like that, uh, to launch like the larger scale

26:29.040 --> 26:36.000
 manufacturing deployment of, uh, tests. It doesn't matter what tests they are. It's obviously the

26:36.000 --> 26:41.120
 capitalist system would create cheaper and cheaper tests that, that would be hopefully driving down

26:41.120 --> 26:46.800
 to $1. So what, what are we talking about? In America, there's, I don't know, 300 plus

26:46.800 --> 26:56.000
 a million people. So that means you want to be testing regularly, right? So how many do you think

26:56.000 --> 27:00.720
 it's possible to manufacture? What would be the ultimate goal to manufacture per month?

27:00.720 --> 27:06.400
 Yep. So if we want to slow this virus and actually stop it from transmitting, achieve what I call

27:06.400 --> 27:12.240
 herd effects like vaccine herd immunity, herd effects are when you get that R value below one

27:13.040 --> 27:16.320
 through preventing onward transmission. If we want to do that with these tests, we need about

27:16.320 --> 27:22.320
 20 million to 40 million of them every day, uh, which is not a lot in the United States. In the

27:22.320 --> 27:26.960
 United States. So we could do it. There's other ways you can have two people in a household,

27:28.080 --> 27:32.800
 swab each other, you know, swab themselves rather, and then mix, you know, put the swabs into the

27:32.800 --> 27:40.240
 same tube and onto one test so you can pool. So you can get a two or three X gain in efficiency

27:40.240 --> 27:44.640
 through pooling in the household. You could do that in schools or offices too, where everyone

27:44.640 --> 27:49.440
 just uses a swab. You have a, there's two people, like, I mean, even if it's just standing in line

27:50.080 --> 27:53.600
 at a public testing site or something, you know, you could just say, okay,

27:53.600 --> 27:58.800
 these two are the last people to test or swab themselves. They go into one thing and if it

27:58.800 --> 28:03.040
 comes back positive, then you just do each person and, you know, it's rapid. So you can just say

28:03.040 --> 28:09.040
 to the people, one of you is positive, let's test you again. So there's ways to get the

28:09.040 --> 28:13.360
 efficiency gains much better. But let's say, I think that the, that the optimal number right

28:13.360 --> 28:18.880
 now that matches sort of what we can produce more or less today, if we wanted is 20 million a day.

28:18.880 --> 28:23.360
 Right now, one company that I don't have their test here, but one company is already producing

28:23.360 --> 28:28.880
 5 million tests themselves and shipping them overseas. It's an American company based in

28:28.880 --> 28:34.640
 California called the Nova and they are giving 5 million tests to the UK every day.

28:36.400 --> 28:40.720
 Not to the, you know, and this is just because there's no, the federal government hasn't

28:40.720 --> 28:46.160
 authorized these tests. So without the support of the government. So yeah. So essentially,

28:46.160 --> 28:52.160
 if the government just put some support behind it, then, then yeah, you can get 20 million,

28:52.800 --> 28:57.600
 probably easy. Oh yeah. This, I mean, just here, I have three different companies. These,

28:57.600 --> 29:02.080
 they all look similar. Well, this one's closed, but these are three different companies right here.

29:02.080 --> 29:07.920
 This is a fourth Abbott, you know, this is a fifth. This is a sixth. These two are a little bit

29:07.920 --> 29:12.160
 different. Do you mind if, you know, a little bit, would you take some of these or? Yeah, let's,

29:12.160 --> 29:16.960
 let's do it. We can, we can, we can absolutely do them. Do you have a lot of tests in front of you?

29:17.680 --> 29:24.320
 Could you maybe explain some of them? Absolutely. So there's a few different classes of tests

29:24.320 --> 29:27.920
 that I just have here. And there's more tests. There's many more different tests out in the world

29:27.920 --> 29:34.400
 too. These are, these are one class of tests. These are rapid antigen tests that are just

29:34.400 --> 29:42.000
 the most bare bones, paper strip tests. These are, this is the type that I want to see produced in

29:42.000 --> 29:47.360
 the tens of millions every day. It's so simple. You know, you don't even need the plastic cartridge.

29:47.360 --> 29:53.920
 You can just, you can just make, make the paper strip and you could have a little,

29:53.920 --> 29:58.560
 a little tube like this that, you know, you just dunk the paper strip into. You don't actually need

29:59.120 --> 30:03.280
 the plastic, which I'd actually prefer because if we start making tens of millions of these,

30:03.280 --> 30:07.840
 this becomes a lot of waste. So I'd rather not see this kind of waste be out there. And there's

30:07.840 --> 30:13.120
 a few companies, Quidel is making a test called the quick view, which is just, just this. It's a,

30:14.320 --> 30:18.240
 they've gotten rid of all the, all the plastic. And for people who are just listening to this,

30:18.240 --> 30:22.880
 we're looking at some very small tests that fit in the palm of your hand and they're basically

30:22.880 --> 30:28.320
 paper strips fit into different containers. And that's hence, hence the comment about the

30:28.320 --> 30:34.320
 plastic containers. These are just injection molded, I think. And they're, you know,

30:34.320 --> 30:38.800
 they can build them at high numbers, but then they have to like place them in there appropriately

30:38.800 --> 30:44.160
 and all this stuff. So it is a, it is a bottleneck or some somewhat of a bottleneck in manufacturing.

30:44.160 --> 30:48.560
 The actual bottleneck, which the government I think should use the defense productions act

30:48.560 --> 30:54.960
 to build up is the, there's a nitrocellulose membrane, laminated membrane on this that allows

30:54.960 --> 31:02.880
 the, the material, the, the, the buffer with the swab mixture to flow across it. So the way these

31:02.880 --> 31:09.360
 work, they're called lateral flow tests. And you take a swab, you swab the front of your nose,

31:09.920 --> 31:15.920
 you dunk that swab into some buffer, and then you put a couple of drops of that buffer onto

31:16.480 --> 31:21.680
 the lateral flow. And just like paper, if you dip a piece of paper into a cup of water,

31:21.680 --> 31:26.240
 though the paper will pull the water up through capillary action. This actually works very similarly

31:26.240 --> 31:31.360
 at flows through, through somewhat of capillary action through this nitrocellulose membrane.

31:32.080 --> 31:36.320
 And there's little antibodies on there, these little proteins that are very specific in this

31:36.320 --> 31:42.640
 case for antigens or proteins of the virus. So these are antibodies similar to how, to the antibodies

31:42.640 --> 31:48.240
 that our body makes from our immune system, but they're just printed on these lateral flow tests

31:48.240 --> 31:53.520
 and they're printed just like a little, a line. So then you, you slice these all up into individual

31:53.520 --> 31:59.360
 ones. And if there's any virus on that buffer as it flows across, the antibodies grab that virus,

31:59.920 --> 32:04.720
 and it creates a little reaction with some colloids in here that cause it to turn dark.

32:04.720 --> 32:10.720
 Just like a pregnancy test, one line means negative, it means the control strip worked,

32:11.440 --> 32:16.480
 and two lines mean positive. It means, you know, but if you get two lines, it just means you have

32:16.480 --> 32:21.440
 virus there, you're very, very likely to have virus there. And so, so they're super simple. This is,

32:21.440 --> 32:26.720
 it is the exact same technology as pregnancy tests. It's the technology, this particular one

32:26.720 --> 32:33.520
 from Abbott, this has been used for other infectious diseases like malaria and, and actually a number

32:33.520 --> 32:39.280
 of these companies have made malaria tests that do the exact same thing. So they just coopted their,

32:39.280 --> 32:45.680
 the same form factor and, and just changed the antibody. So it picks up SARS CoV2 instead of

32:45.680 --> 32:50.240
 other infections. Is it also the Abbott one? Is it also a strip? Yep. Yeah. This Abbott one here is,

32:50.800 --> 32:54.640
 there's the, in this case, instead of being put in a plastic sheath, it's just put in a cardboard

32:54.640 --> 33:00.240
 thing and literally glued on. I mean, it's, it looks like nothing, you know, it's just, it looks

33:00.240 --> 33:05.280
 like a, like, I mean, it's just the simplest thing you could, you could imagine. The exterior

33:05.280 --> 33:12.400
 packaging looks very Apple like this. Nice. It does. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's nice. This is the,

33:12.400 --> 33:18.400
 this is how they're packaged, you know, so and they don't have to, you know, this, these are

33:18.400 --> 33:22.400
 coming in individual packages against, again, because they're really considered individual

33:22.400 --> 33:27.040
 medical devices, but you could package them in, you know, bigger packets and stuff. You,

33:27.040 --> 33:33.040
 you want to be careful with humidity. So they all have a little, one of those humidity removing

33:33.040 --> 33:39.200
 things and oxygen removing things. So that's the, this is one class, these antigen tests.

33:39.200 --> 33:46.640
 If we could just pause for a second if it's okay. And could you just briefly say what is an antigen

33:46.640 --> 33:52.000
 test and what other tests there are out there, like categories of tests? Sure. Just really quick.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.640
 So the testing landscape is a little bit complicated, but it's, but I'll break it down. There's really

33:56.640 --> 34:03.760
 just three major classes of tests. We'll start with the first two. The first two tests are just

34:03.760 --> 34:09.840
 looking for the virus or looking for antibodies against the virus. So we've heard about serology

34:09.840 --> 34:14.640
 tests, or maybe some people have heard about it. Those are a different kind of tests. They're looking

34:14.640 --> 34:20.000
 to see, has somebody in the past, does somebody have an immune response against the virus, which

34:20.000 --> 34:24.720
 would indicate that they were infected or exposed to it. So we're not talking about the antibody

34:24.720 --> 34:30.320
 tests. I'll just leave it at that. Those, they, they actually can look very similar to this or

34:30.320 --> 34:36.880
 they can be done in a laboratory. They, those are usually done from blood and they're, they're

34:36.880 --> 34:41.760
 looking for an immune response to the virus. So that's one. Everything I'm talking about here is

34:41.760 --> 34:46.720
 looking for the virus itself, not the immune response to the virus. And so you, there's two

34:46.720 --> 34:50.800
 ways to look for the virus. You can either look for the genetic code of the virus, like the RNA,

34:50.800 --> 34:56.160
 just like the DNA of somebody's human cells, or you can look for the proteins themselves, the

34:56.160 --> 35:02.640
 proteins themselves, the antigens of the pro of the virus. So I like to differentiate them. If you

35:02.640 --> 35:10.800
 were a PCR test that looks for RNA in, let's say, let's say if we made it against humans,

35:10.800 --> 35:14.880
 it would be looking for the DNA inside of our cells that would be actually looking for our genetic

35:14.880 --> 35:22.320
 code. The equivalent to an antigen test is sort of a test that like actually is looking for our

35:22.320 --> 35:27.600
 eyes or our nose or physical features of our body that would delineate. Okay, this is,

35:28.160 --> 35:33.760
 this is Michael, for example. And so, so you're either looking for this a sequence or you're

35:33.760 --> 35:39.600
 looking for a structure. The PCR tests that a lot of people have gotten now and they're done in labs

35:39.600 --> 35:46.160
 usually are looking for the sequence of the virus, which is RNA. This test here by a company called

35:46.160 --> 35:53.280
 Detect. This is one of Jonathan Rothberg's companies. He's the guy who helped create modern day

35:53.280 --> 35:58.720
 sequencing and all kinds of other things. So this Detect device, that's the name of the company,

35:58.720 --> 36:04.000
 this is actually a rapid RNA detection device. So it's almost, it's like a PCR like test,

36:04.000 --> 36:10.240
 and we could even do it here. It's really, it's a beautiful test, in my opinion, works exceedingly

36:10.240 --> 36:14.720
 well. It's going to be a little bit more expensive. So I think it could confirm, could be used as a

36:14.720 --> 36:20.800
 confirmatory test for these. Is there a greater accuracy to it? Yes, I would say that there is a

36:20.800 --> 36:27.760
 greater accuracy. There's also a downfall though of PCR and tests that look for RNA. They can

36:27.760 --> 36:33.920
 sometimes detect somebody who is no longer infectious. So you have the RNA test and then you

36:33.920 --> 36:38.960
 have these antigen tests. The antigen tests look for structures, but they're generally only going

36:38.960 --> 36:45.840
 to turn positive if people have actively replicating virus in them. And so what happens after an

36:45.840 --> 36:53.120
 infection dissipates, you have, you've just gone from having sort of a spike. So if you get infected,

36:53.120 --> 36:58.320
 maybe three days later, the virus gets into exponential growth and it can replicate to

36:58.320 --> 37:04.240
 trillions of viruses inside the body. Your immune system then kind of tackles it and beats it down

37:04.240 --> 37:09.920
 to nothing. But what ends up in the wake of that, you just had a battle. You had this massive battle

37:09.920 --> 37:15.520
 that just took place inside your upper respiratory tract. And because of that, you've had trillions

37:15.520 --> 37:22.880
 and trillions of viruses go to zero, essentially. But the RNA is still there. It's just these remnants

37:22.880 --> 37:27.920
 in the same way that if you go to a crime scene and blood was sort of spread all over the crime

37:27.920 --> 37:32.480
 scene, you're going to find a lot of DNA. There's tons of DNA. There's no people anymore,

37:32.480 --> 37:37.760
 but there's a lot of DNA there. Same thing happens here. And so what's happening with PCR testing

37:37.760 --> 37:44.560
 is when people go and use these exceedingly high sensitivity PCR tests, people will stay positive

37:44.560 --> 37:50.400
 for weeks or months after their infection has subsided, which has caused a lot of problems in

37:50.400 --> 37:56.400
 my opinion. It's problems that the CDC and the FDA and doctors don't want to deal with. But I've

37:56.400 --> 38:02.000
 tried to publish on it. I've tried to suggest that this is an issue both in New York Times

38:02.000 --> 38:06.640
 and others. And now it's unfortunately kind of taken on a life of its own of conspiracy theorists

38:06.640 --> 38:15.360
 thinking that they call it a case demig. They say, oh, PCR is detecting people who are false

38:15.360 --> 38:20.640
 positive. They're not false positives. They're late positives, no longer transmissible.

38:20.640 --> 38:26.400
 I think the way you, like what I saw in rapidest.org, I really like the distinction between

38:26.400 --> 38:34.960
 diagnostic sensitivity and contagiousness sensitivity. That's so, that website is so obvious

38:36.320 --> 38:40.080
 that it's painful because it's like, yeah, that's what we should be talking about is

38:41.040 --> 38:47.200
 how accurately is a test able to detect your contagiousness? And you have different plots

38:47.200 --> 38:54.000
 that show that actually there's, you know, that antigen tests, the tests we're looking at today

38:54.000 --> 38:59.680
 like rapid tests are actually really good at detecting contagiousness. Absolutely. It all

38:59.680 --> 39:05.760
 mixes back with this whole idea that of the medical industrial complex, you know, in this country

39:05.760 --> 39:13.840
 and in most countries, we have almost entirely defunded and devalued public health period. You

39:13.840 --> 39:22.000
 know, we just have. And what that means is that we don't even, we don't have a language for it.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.720
 We don't have a lexicon for it. We don't have a regulatory landscape for it. And so the only

39:26.720 --> 39:35.600
 window we have to look at a test today is as a medical diagnostic test. And that becomes very

39:35.600 --> 39:42.240
 problematic when we're trying to tackle a public health threat and a public health emergency by

39:42.240 --> 39:48.000
 definition. This is a public health emergency that we're in. And yet we keep evaluating tests

39:48.000 --> 39:55.600
 as though the diagnostic benchmark is the gold standard where if I'm a physician, I am a physician,

39:55.600 --> 40:02.320
 so I'll put on that physician hat for a moment. And if I have a patient who comes to me and wants to

40:03.280 --> 40:10.240
 know if their symptoms are a result of them having COVID, then I want every shred of evidence that

40:10.240 --> 40:16.400
 I can get to see, does this person currently or did they recently have this infection inside of them?

40:16.400 --> 40:23.520
 And so in that sense, the PCR test is the perfect test. It's really sensitive. It will find the RNA

40:23.520 --> 40:28.400
 if it's there at all so that I could say, you know, yeah, you have a low amount of RNA left. You

40:28.400 --> 40:34.800
 might have been, you said your symptoms started two weeks ago. You probably were infectious two

40:34.800 --> 40:41.440
 weeks ago and you have lingering symptoms from it. But that's a medical diagnosis. It's kind of

40:41.440 --> 40:47.840
 like a detective recreating a crime scene. They want to go back there and recreate the pieces

40:47.840 --> 40:53.600
 so that they can assign blame or whatever it might be. But that's not public health. And public

40:53.600 --> 40:58.160
 health, we need to only look forward. We don't want to go back and say, well, was this person,

40:58.160 --> 41:02.960
 are there symptoms because they had an infection two weeks ago? In public health, we just want to

41:02.960 --> 41:09.200
 stop the virus from spreading to the next person. And so that's where we don't care if somebody was

41:09.200 --> 41:17.200
 infected two weeks ago. We only care about finding the people who are infectious today. And unfortunately,

41:17.200 --> 41:25.200
 our regulatory landscape fails to apply that knowledge to evaluate these tests as public health

41:25.200 --> 41:31.200
 tools. They're only evaluating the tests as medical tools. And therefore, we get all kinds of

41:31.200 --> 41:41.200
 complaints that say this test, which detects 99 plus, 99.8% of current infectious people.

41:43.680 --> 41:49.840
 By the FDA's rubric, they'll say, no, no, it's only 50% sensitive. And that's because when you go out

41:49.840 --> 41:56.080
 into the world and you just compare this against PCR positivity, most people who are PCR positive

41:56.080 --> 42:01.760
 in the world right now at any given time, are post infectious. They're no longer infectious

42:01.760 --> 42:07.360
 because you might only be infectious for five days, but then you'll remain PCR positive for

42:07.360 --> 42:12.080
 three or four or five weeks. And so when you go and just evaluate these tests and you say, okay,

42:12.080 --> 42:18.240
 this person's PCR positive, does the rapid antigen test detect that? More often than not,

42:18.240 --> 42:24.640
 it's no. But that's because those people don't need isolation. They're post infectious. And this is

42:24.640 --> 42:31.440
 a, it's become much more of a problem than I think even the FDA themselves is recognizing

42:31.440 --> 42:37.680
 because they are unwilling at this point to look at this as a public health problem requiring

42:37.680 --> 42:42.720
 public health tools. We'll definitely talk about this a little bit more because the concern I have

42:42.720 --> 42:47.920
 is that like a bigger pandemic comes along, what are the lessons we draw from this and how we move

42:47.920 --> 42:54.960
 forward? Let's talk about that in a bit. But sort of, can we discuss further the lay of the land

42:54.960 --> 43:00.400
 here of the different tests before us? Absolutely. So I talked about PCR tests and those are done in

43:00.400 --> 43:06.720
 the lab or they're done essentially with a rapid test like this, the detect. And we can even try

43:06.720 --> 43:11.600
 this in a moment. It goes into a little heater. So you might have one of these in a household or

43:12.240 --> 43:15.280
 one of these in a nursing home or something like that, or in an airport,

43:15.280 --> 43:20.800
 or you could have one that has 100 different outlets. This is just to heat the tube up.

43:21.440 --> 43:29.280
 These are the rapid tests. They are super simple. No frills. You just swab your nose and you put the

43:29.280 --> 43:33.840
 swab into a buffer and you put the buffer on the test. So we can use these right now if you want.

43:33.840 --> 43:40.000
 Yeah. We can try it out. And all the tests we're talking about, they're usually swabbing the nose.

43:40.000 --> 43:46.560
 Like that's the... That's still the main, yeah. There are some saliva tests coming about and these

43:46.560 --> 43:52.000
 can all work potentially with saliva. They just have to be recalibrated. But these swabs are really

43:52.000 --> 43:59.040
 not bad. This isn't the deep swab that goes like way back into your nose or anything. This is just

44:00.640 --> 44:04.720
 a swab that you do yourself like right in the front of your nose. So if you want to do it...

44:04.720 --> 44:05.680
 Yeah. Do you mind if I...

44:05.680 --> 44:10.720
 Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Why don't we start with this one? Because this is the Abbots Bynex Now test

44:10.720 --> 44:15.760
 and it's really... It's pretty simple. This is the swab from the Abbott test.

44:15.760 --> 44:20.720
 That's correct. That's the swab from the Abbott test. So what I'm going to do to start

44:21.520 --> 44:27.920
 is I'm going to take this buffer here, which is... This is just the buffer that goes onto this test.

44:27.920 --> 44:33.760
 So this is a brand new one. I just opened this test out. I'm going to just take six drops of this

44:33.760 --> 44:43.040
 buffer and put it right onto this test here. Two, three, four, five, six.

44:43.520 --> 44:46.800
 Okay. And now you're going to take that swab, open it up.

44:48.080 --> 44:52.400
 Yep. And now just wipe it around inside the... Into the front of your nose.

44:52.400 --> 44:54.800
 Do a few circles on each nostril.

44:54.800 --> 45:01.600
 Yeah. That looks good.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.520
 This always makes me want to sneeze.

45:05.520 --> 45:09.360
 Yeah. Okay. Now I'm going to have you do it yourself.

45:12.000 --> 45:12.960
 I'm getting emotional.

45:13.600 --> 45:17.520
 Hold it parallel to the test. So put the test down on the table. Yep. And then go into that

45:17.520 --> 45:22.000
 bottom hole. Yep. And push forward so that you can start to see it in the other hole.

45:22.000 --> 45:27.600
 There you go. Now turn. If it's... Once it hits up against the top, just turn it three times.

45:27.600 --> 45:35.200
 One, two, three, and sort of... Yep. And now you just close. So pull off that adhesive sticker there.

45:37.120 --> 45:38.880
 And now you just close the whole thing.

45:41.600 --> 45:50.640
 And... And that's it. That's it. Now what we will see is we will see a line form.

45:50.640 --> 45:56.320
 What's happening now is the buffer that you put in there is now

45:57.920 --> 46:04.800
 moving up onto the paper strip test. And it has the material from the swab in there.

46:04.800 --> 46:09.040
 And so what we'll see is a line will form. And that's going to be the control line.

46:10.160 --> 46:16.880
 And then we'll also see the... Ideally, we'll see no line for the actual test line.

46:16.880 --> 46:23.040
 And that's because you should be negative. So one line will be positive and two lines will be negative.

46:23.920 --> 46:29.920
 That's very cool. There's this purple thing creeping up onto the control line.

46:31.440 --> 46:36.320
 That's perfect. That's what you want to be seeing. So you want to see that...

46:37.600 --> 46:45.600
 So right now, you essentially want to see that that blue line turns pink or purpley color.

46:45.600 --> 46:51.600
 There's a blue line that's already there printed. It should turn sort of a purple pink color.

46:52.560 --> 46:57.680
 And ideally, there will be no additional line for the sample.

47:00.560 --> 47:08.960
 And if there is, that's the 99. whatever percent accuracy on... That means I have... I'm contagious.

47:08.960 --> 47:14.080
 That would mean that you're likely contagious or you likely have infectious virus in you.

47:14.080 --> 47:18.400
 What we can do, because one of the things that my plan calls for,

47:19.440 --> 47:23.600
 is because sometimes these tests can get false positive results. It's rare.

47:24.400 --> 47:31.760
 Maybe 1% or in the case of this by next now, this Abbott test, 0.1%. So 1 in 1,000, 1 in 500,

47:31.760 --> 47:36.480
 something like that can be falsely positive. What I recommend is that when somebody is

47:37.280 --> 47:42.160
 positive on one of these, you turn around and you immediately test on a different test.

47:42.160 --> 47:47.360
 You could either do it on the same, but for a good measure, you want to use a separate test

47:48.080 --> 47:55.040
 that is somewhat orthogonal, meaning that it shouldn't turn falsely positive for the same reason.

47:55.920 --> 48:02.400
 This particular test here, this detect test, because it is looking for the RNA and not the

48:02.400 --> 48:09.440
 antigen, this is an amazingly accurate test. And it's sort of a perfect gold standard or

48:09.440 --> 48:14.640
 confirmatory test for any of these antigen tests. So one of the recommendations that I've had,

48:14.640 --> 48:21.440
 especially if people start using antigen tests before you get onto a plane or as what I call

48:21.440 --> 48:26.800
 entrance screening, if somebody's positive, you don't immediately tell them you're positive,

48:26.800 --> 48:33.040
 go isolate for 10 days. You tell them, let's confirm on one of these on a detect test.

48:33.040 --> 48:40.640
 That is because it's completely orthogonal, it's looking for the RNA instead of the antigen. There's

48:40.640 --> 48:47.920
 no reason, no biological reason that both of these should be falsely positive. So if one's

48:47.920 --> 48:52.400
 falsely positive and the other one is negative, especially because this one's more sensitive,

48:53.680 --> 49:00.240
 then I would trust this as a confirmatory test. If this one's negative, then the antigen test

49:00.240 --> 49:04.560
 would be considered falsely positive. It does look like there's only a single line. This is very

49:04.560 --> 49:11.440
 exciting news. That's right. Yep. It says wait 15 minutes to see both lines. But in general,

49:11.440 --> 49:16.160
 if somebody's really going to be positive, that line starts showing up within a minute or two.

49:16.960 --> 49:20.560
 So you want to keep the whole, we'll keep watching it for the whole 15 minutes as it's

49:20.560 --> 49:26.240
 sitting there. But I would say you're knowing that you've had PCR tests recently and all that.

49:26.240 --> 49:30.560
 The odds are pretty good. The odds are very good. The packaging, very iPhone like,

49:31.440 --> 49:35.840
 I'm digging the sexy packaging. I'm a sucker for good packaging. Okay.

49:35.840 --> 49:42.480
 So then there's this test here, which is, this is another, it's funny. Let me open this up and

49:42.480 --> 49:46.880
 show you. This is a really nice test. It's another antigen test. Works the exact same way as this,

49:46.880 --> 49:52.320
 essentially. But what you can see is it's got lights in it and a power button and stuff. This

49:52.320 --> 50:02.400
 is called an allume test, which is fine. And it's a really nice test, to be honest. But it has to

50:02.400 --> 50:08.960
 pair with an iPhone. And so it's good as a, I think that this is going to become, there's a

50:08.960 --> 50:13.600
 lot of use for this from a medical perspective, where you want good reporting. This can, because

50:13.600 --> 50:20.240
 it pairs with an iPhone, it can immediately send the report to a Department of Health,

50:20.240 --> 50:25.200
 whereas these paper strip tests that they're just paper, they don't report anything unless you

50:25.200 --> 50:29.520
 want to report it. Okay. So I'm going to just pick it up and pick it apart. And so you can see,

50:30.160 --> 50:34.480
 is there's like fluorescent readers and little lasers and LEDs and stuff in there.

50:34.480 --> 50:39.200
 You can actually see the lights going off. And there's a paper strip test right inside there,

50:39.200 --> 50:44.720
 but you can see that there's like a whole circuit board and all this stuff. Right. And so

50:44.720 --> 50:53.120
 this is the kind of thing that, you know, the FDA is looking for, for like home use and things like

50:53.120 --> 50:58.240
 that, because it's kind of foolproof. Like you can't go wrong with it. It pairs with an iPhone,

50:58.240 --> 51:01.840
 so you need Bluetooth. So it's going to be more limited. It's a great test. Don't get me wrong.

51:01.840 --> 51:07.440
 It's as good as any of these. But, you know, when you compare this thing with a battery and a

51:07.440 --> 51:12.160
 circuit board and all this stuff, it's got its purpose, but, you know, it's not a public health

51:12.160 --> 51:16.640
 tool. I don't want to see this made in the tens of millions a day and thrown away.

51:16.640 --> 51:21.600
 But FDA likes that kind of stuff. FDA loves this stuff, you know, because they can't get

51:21.600 --> 51:26.560
 it out of their mind that this is a public health crisis. You know, we need, we need,

51:26.560 --> 51:30.720
 I mean, just look at the difference here. Something flashing lights is essential.

51:30.720 --> 51:34.720
 Got batteries. It's got a Bluetooth thing. It's a great test, but, you know, it's,

51:34.720 --> 51:40.960
 to be honest, it's not any better than this one. And so, you know, I want this one.

51:40.960 --> 51:46.880
 It's nice and all. The form factor is nice, but, and it's really nice that it goes to Bluetooth.

51:46.880 --> 51:52.880
 But it goes against the principle of just 20 million a day. The easy solution. Everybody has it.

51:52.880 --> 51:57.760
 You can manufacture and probably, you could have probably scaled this up in a couple of weeks.

51:57.760 --> 52:03.200
 Oh, absolutely. These companies, I mean, the rest of the world has these. They can be scaled up.

52:03.200 --> 52:08.400
 They already exist. You know, SD biosensors, one company is making tens of millions a day,

52:08.400 --> 52:13.920
 not coming to the United States, but going all over Europe, going all over Southeast Asia and

52:13.920 --> 52:18.880
 East Asia. So they exist. The US is just, you know, we can't get out of our own way.

52:18.880 --> 52:22.880
 I wonder what, why somebody, I don't know if you were paying attention, but somebody like an Elon

52:22.880 --> 52:29.520
 Musk type character. So he was really into doing some like obvious engineering solution, like this

52:30.400 --> 52:35.280
 at home rapid test seems like a very Elon Musk thing to do.

52:35.280 --> 52:39.440
 Well, I don't know if you saw, but I had a little Twitter conversation with Elon Musk.

52:39.440 --> 52:43.760
 Does he not like what was it? Do you know what his thoughts are on rapid testing?

52:43.760 --> 52:47.920
 Well, he was using a slightly different one, one of these, but that requires an instrument called

52:47.920 --> 52:52.640
 the BD Veritor. And he got a false positive or no, I shouldn't say he didn't necessarily get a

52:52.640 --> 52:57.680
 false positive. He got discrepant results. He did this test four times. He got two positives, two

52:57.680 --> 53:04.080
 negatives. But then he got a PCR test and it was a very low positive result. So I think

53:04.080 --> 53:08.880
 what happened is he just tested himself at the tail end of it. This was actually right before

53:08.880 --> 53:12.480
 he was about to send those. It was the day of essentially that he was sending the astronauts

53:12.480 --> 53:17.360
 up to the space station the other day. So he was using these rapid tests because he wanted to

53:17.360 --> 53:23.760
 make sure that he was good to go in and he got discrepant results. Ultimately, they were correct,

53:23.760 --> 53:28.160
 but you know, two were negative, two were positive. But what really happened, once he got his,

53:28.160 --> 53:33.200
 he shared his PCR results and they were very low positive. So really what was happening

53:33.200 --> 53:39.120
 is my guess is he found himself right at the edge of his positivity, of his infectiousness.

53:39.120 --> 53:44.080
 And so, you know, the test worked out, it was supposed to work. It probably had he used it

53:44.080 --> 53:47.280
 two days earlier. It would have been screaming positive. You know, he wouldn't have gotten

53:47.280 --> 53:52.320
 discrepant results. But he found himself right at the edge by the time he used the test. So the

53:52.320 --> 53:57.040
 PCR would always pick it up because it's still, because it will still stay positive then for

53:57.040 --> 54:03.600
 weeks, potentially. But the rapid antigen test was starting to falter, not in a bad way, but just

54:04.400 --> 54:08.960
 he probably was really no longer particularly infectious. And so it was kind of when it gets

54:08.960 --> 54:11.440
 to be a very low viral load, it becomes stochastic.

54:12.160 --> 54:17.120
 It's fascinating this duality. So one, you can think from an individual perspective,

54:17.840 --> 54:23.920
 it's unclear when you take four and a half are positive, half a negative, like what are you

54:23.920 --> 54:30.160
 supposed to do? But from a societal perspective, it seems like if just one of them is positive,

54:30.720 --> 54:36.480
 just stay home for a couple days, for a while. So if one year CEO of a company you're launching

54:36.480 --> 54:45.360
 astronauts to space, you may not want to rely absolutely on the antigen test as a thing by

54:45.360 --> 54:52.160
 which you steer your decisions of like 10,000 plus people companies. But us individuals just

54:52.160 --> 54:59.440
 living in the world, if it comes up positive, then you make decisions based on that. And then

54:59.440 --> 55:03.920
 that scales really nicely to an entire society of hundreds of millions of people. And that's how

55:03.920 --> 55:09.360
 you get that virus to a stop spreading. That's exactly right. You don't have to catch every

55:09.360 --> 55:15.040
 single one. And the nice thing is that these will, these will catch the people who are most

55:15.040 --> 55:20.640
 infectious. So with Elon Musk, generally that test, we don't have the counterfactual. We don't

55:20.640 --> 55:27.120
 have his results from three days earlier when he was probably most infectious. But my guess is the

55:27.120 --> 55:33.600
 fact that it was catching two out of the four, even when he was down at a CT value of really,

55:33.600 --> 55:40.480
 really very, very low viral load on the PCR test suggests that it was doing its job. And you just

55:40.480 --> 55:47.120
 want to, and the nice thing is because these can be produced at such scale, getting one positive

55:47.120 --> 55:53.840
 doesn't immediately have to mean 10 days of isolation. That's the CDC's more conservative

55:53.840 --> 56:00.240
 stance to say, if you're positive on any test, stay home for 10 days and isolate. But here,

56:00.240 --> 56:04.640
 people would just have more tests. So the recommendation should be test daily. If you

56:04.640 --> 56:09.680
 turn positive test daily, until you've been negative for 24, 48 hours, and then go back to

56:09.680 --> 56:14.320
 work. And the nice thing there is, right now, people just aren't testing because they don't want

56:14.320 --> 56:18.400
 to take 10 days off. They're not getting paid for it. So they can't take 10 days off.

56:18.400 --> 56:24.400
 Do you know what Elon thinks about this idea of rapid testing for everybody? So I understood,

56:24.400 --> 56:29.360
 I need to look at that whole Twitter thread. So I understand his perhaps criticism of,

56:30.960 --> 56:36.560
 he had like a conspiratorial tone for my vague look at it of like, what's going on here with

56:36.560 --> 56:42.400
 these tests? But what does he actually think about this very practical to me engineering

56:42.400 --> 56:46.400
 solution of just deploying rapid tests to everybody? It seems like that's a way to open

56:46.400 --> 56:51.360
 up the economy in April. Well, to be honest, I've been trying to get in touch with him again.

56:51.360 --> 56:57.840
 I think, take somebody like Elon Musk with the engineering prowess within his ranks to

56:59.360 --> 57:06.960
 easily, easily build these at the tens of millions a day. He could build the machines from scratch.

57:06.960 --> 57:12.960
 A lot of the companies, they buy the machines from South Korea or Taiwan, I believe. We don't

57:12.960 --> 57:19.200
 have to. We can build these machines. They're simple to build. Put somebody like Elon Musk on it.

57:20.000 --> 57:26.960
 Take some of his best engineers and say, look, the US needs a solution in two weeks. Build

57:26.960 --> 57:32.880
 these machines. Figure it out. He'll do it. He could do it. This is a guy who is literally,

57:32.880 --> 57:40.720
 he started multiple entirely new industries. He has the capital to do it without the US government

57:40.720 --> 57:48.560
 if he wanted to. The return on investment for him would be huge. But frankly, the return on

57:48.560 --> 57:54.240
 investment in the country would be hundreds of billions of dollars because it means we could

57:54.240 --> 58:01.920
 get society open. I know that his first experience with these rapid tests was confusing, which is

58:01.920 --> 58:08.640
 how I ended up having this Twitter conversation with him very briefly. But I think that if he

58:08.640 --> 58:13.120
 understood a little bit more, and I think he does, I really love to talk to him about it,

58:13.120 --> 58:17.280
 because I think he could totally change the course of this pandemic in the United States

58:17.280 --> 58:24.320
 singlehandedly. He loves grand things. I think out of all the solutions I've seen,

58:24.320 --> 58:32.640
 this is the obvious engineering solution to at least a pandemic of this scale.

58:32.640 --> 58:37.680
 I love that you say the engineering solution. So this is something I've been really trying to,

58:38.400 --> 58:44.080
 I'm an engineer. My previous history was all engineering, and that's really how I think.

58:44.880 --> 58:53.360
 I then went into medicine and PhD world. But I think that the world, one of the major

58:53.360 --> 58:58.560
 catastrophes or one of the major problems is that we have physicians making the decisions about

58:58.560 --> 59:04.480
 public health and a pandemic when really we need engineers. This is an engineering problem.

59:05.440 --> 59:10.960
 What I've been trying to do, I actually really want to start a whole new field called public

59:10.960 --> 59:17.360
 health engineering. Eventually, I want to try to bring it to MIT and get MIT to want to start a

59:17.360 --> 59:26.560
 new department or something. That's a doubly awesome idea. I love this. I love every aspect.

59:26.560 --> 59:32.480
 I love everything you're talking about. A lot of people believe because vaccines started being

59:32.480 --> 59:43.360
 deployed currently that we are no longer in need of a solution. We're no longer in need of slowing

59:43.360 --> 59:48.960
 the spread of the virus. To me, as I understand, it seems like this is the most important time

59:49.680 --> 59:56.160
 to have something like a rapid testing solution. Can you break that apart? What's the role of rapid

59:56.160 --> 1:00:05.120
 testing in the next three, four months maybe? Even more. The vaccine rollout isn't going to be as

1:00:05.120 --> 1:00:12.000
 peachy as everyone is hoping. I hate to be the Debbie Downer here, but there's a lot of unknowns

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:16.480
 with this vaccine. You've already mentioned one, which is there's a lot of people who just don't

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:21.920
 want to get the vaccine. I hope that that might change as things move forward and people see

1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:26.160
 their neighbors getting it and their family getting it, and it's safe and all. We don't know how

1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:30.160
 effective the vaccine is going to be after two or three months. We've only measured it in the first

1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:35.440
 two or three months, which is a massive problem, which we can go into biologically because there's

1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:40.880
 reasons, very good reasons to believe that the efficacy could fall way down after two or three

1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:45.840
 months. We don't know if it's going to stop transmission, and if it doesn't stop transmission,

1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:52.800
 then herd immunity is much, much more difficult to get because that's all based on transmission

1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:59.040
 blockade. And frankly, we don't know how easily we're going to be able to roll it out. Some of

1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:04.000
 the vaccines need really significant cold chains, have very short half lives outside of that cold

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:11.680
 chain. We need to organize massive numbers of people to be able to distribute these. Most

1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:16.560
 hospitals today are saying that they're not equipped to hire the right people to be even

1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:20.880
 administering enough of these vaccines. And then a lot of the hospitals are frustrated because

1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:27.120
 they're getting much lower, smaller allocations than they were expecting. So I think right now,

1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:34.400
 like you say, right now is the best time, besides three or four or five or six months ago,

1:01:34.400 --> 1:01:42.000
 right now is the best time to get these rapid tests out. The country has the capacity to build

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:47.760
 them. We're shipping them overseas right now. We just need to flip a switch, get the FDA to

1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:53.040
 recognize that there's more important things than diagnostic medicine, which is the effectiveness of

1:01:53.040 --> 1:01:59.760
 the public health program when we're dealing with a pandemic. They need to authorize these as public

1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:08.640
 health tools or frankly, the president could. There's a lot of other ways to get these tests to

1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:13.600
 not have to go through the normal FDA authorization program, but maybe have the NIH and the CDC

1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:20.240
 give a stamp of approval. And if we could, we could get these out tomorrow. And that's where

1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:26.400
 that article came from, how we can stop the spread of this virus by Christmas. We could. Now it's

1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:32.240
 getting late. And so we have to keep updating that timeframe, maybe putting Christmas in the title

1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:36.560
 wasn't, I should have said how we can stop the spread of this virus in a month. It would be a

1:02:36.560 --> 1:02:42.320
 little bit more timeless, but we could do it. We really could do it. And that's the most frustrating

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:48.720
 part here is that we're just choosing not to as a country. We're choosing to bankrupt our society

1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:54.800
 because some people at the FDA and other places just can't seem to get their head around the fact

1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:59.360
 that this is a public health problem, not a bunch of medical problems. Is there a way to change that

1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:04.720
 policy wise? So this is, this is a much bigger thing that you're speaking to, which I, I love in

1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:13.680
 terms of the MIT engineering approach to public health. Is there a way to push this? Is this,

1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:19.600
 is this a political thing like where some Andrew Yang type characters need to like start screaming

1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:27.520
 about it? Is it more of an Elon Musk thing where people just need to build it and then on Twitter

1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:33.840
 start talking crap to politicians who are not doing it? What are the ideas here?

1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:39.840
 I think it's a little both. I think it's political on the one hand, and I've certainly been talking

1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:44.880
 to Congress a lot, talking to senators. Are they receptive? Oh, yeah. I mean, that's the crazy

1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:50.560
 thing. Everyone but the FDA is receptive. I mean, it's, it's astounding. I mean, I advise, you know,

1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:56.880
 informally, I advise the president and the president elects teams. I talk to Congress,

1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:04.880
 I talk to senators, governors, you know, and then all the way down to mayors of towns and things.

1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:10.240
 And I held, I mean, months ago, I held a roundtable discussion with Mayor Garcetti,

1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:15.600
 who's the mayor of LA. And I brought all the, all the companies who make these things. This was in

1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:19.280
 like July or August or something. I brought all the companies to the table and said, okay, how can

1:04:19.280 --> 1:04:25.840
 we get these out? And unfortunately, it went nowhere because the FDA won't authorize them as

1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:32.080
 public health tools. The nice thing is that this is one of the nice and frustrating things. This

1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:37.520
 is one of the few bipartisan things that I know of. And like you said, it's, it's a real solution.

1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:46.000
 Lockdowns aren't a solution. They're, they're an emergency bandaid to a catastrophe that's

1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.160
 currently happening. They're not a solution. And they're definitely not a public health solution

1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:55.680
 if we're taking a more holistic view of public health, which includes people's well being,

1:04:55.680 --> 1:04:59.520
 includes their psychological well being, their financial well being, you know,

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:03.680
 just stopping a virus if it means that all those other things get thrown under the bus

1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:10.800
 is not a public health solution. It's a, it's a, it's a myopic or very tunnel vision

1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:18.240
 approach to a viral virus that's spreading. This is a simple solution with essentially

1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:23.040
 no downfall. You know, there is no, nothing bad about this. It's just giving people

1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:30.400
 a result. And it's bipartisan, you know, the most conservative and the most liberal people.

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:35.040
 Everyone just wants to know their status. You know, nobody wants to have to wait in line for

1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:41.120
 four hours to find out their status on Monday, a week later on Saturday. You know, it just doesn't

1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:45.120
 make any sense. It's a useless test at that point. And everyone recognizes that.

1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:54.160
 So why, why do you think like the mayor of LA, why do you think politicians are going for these,

1:05:54.160 --> 1:06:00.800
 from my perspective, like kind of half ass lockdowns, which is not, so I have seen good

1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:06.480
 evidence that like a complete lockdown can work, but that's in theory, it's just like

1:06:06.480 --> 1:06:12.480
 communism in theory can work. Like theoretically speaking, but it just doesn't, at least in

1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:17.760
 this country, we don't, I think it's just impossible to have complete lockdown. And still,

1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:23.040
 politicians are going for these kind of lockdowns that everybody hates,

1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:29.680
 that's really, really hurting small businesses. Like, why are they going for that?

1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:37.280
 Yeah, all businesses, but like basically not just hurting, they're destroying small businesses,

1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:46.800
 right? Which is going to have potentially, I mean, yeah, I've been reading as I don't

1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:52.640
 shout out about the rise and fall of the third Reich. And, you know, there's economic effects

1:06:53.760 --> 1:07:00.080
 that take a decade to, you know, there's going to be long lasting effects that may maybe

1:07:00.080 --> 1:07:05.040
 destructive to the very fabric of this nation. So why are they doing it? And why they're not

1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:11.040
 using the solution? Is there an intuition? I mean, you've said that FDA has a stranglehold,

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:16.080
 I guess, on this whole public health problem. Is that all it is?

1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:23.680
 That's honestly, it's pretty much all it is. The company, so the somebody like Mayor Garcetti or

1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:31.840
 Governor Baker, Cuomo Newsom, any of these, DeWine, I've talked to a lot of governors in

1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:38.880
 this country at this point. And of course, the federal government, including the president's

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:44.400
 own teams, you know, and the heads of the NIH, the heads of the CDC about this.

1:07:45.680 --> 1:07:52.080
 The problem is the tests don't exist in this country at the level that we need them to right now

1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:59.360
 to make that kind of policy, to make that kind of program. They could, but they don't. And so

1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:05.200
 what that means is that when Mayor Garcetti says, okay, what are my actual options today,

1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:10.720
 despite these sounding like a great idea, he looks around and he says, well, they're not

1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:16.240
 authorized. You know, they don't exist right now for at home use. And from his perspective,

1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:20.160
 he's not about to pick that fight with the FDA. And it turns out nobody is.

1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:25.600
 Why are people afraid of it? It seems like an easy struggle to fight. It's like, uh...

1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:31.120
 Well, it's not a... So they don't see it as a fight. They think that the FDA is the end all

1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:36.880
 be all. Everyone thinks the FDA is the end all be all. And so they just differ. Everyone is

1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:42.160
 deferential, including the heads of all the other government agencies, because that is their role.

1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:47.680
 But what everyone is failing to see is that the FDA doesn't even have a mandate or a remit

1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:52.480
 to evaluate these tests as public health tools. So they're just falling in this weird gray zone

1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:58.960
 where the FDA is saying, look, we evaluate medical products. That's the only thing that

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:04.720
 I meant, like Tim Stenzel, head of Invitra Diagnostics at the FDA. He's doing what his job is,

1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:12.640
 which is to evaluate medical tools. Unfortunately, this is where I think the CDC has really

1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:19.280
 blended. They haven't made the right distinction to say, look, okay, the FDA is evaluating these

1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:24.880
 for doctors to use and all that. But we're the CDC and we're the public health agency of this

1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:30.400
 country. And we recognize that these tools require a different authorization pathway and a different

1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:36.800
 use, not prescription. There's a difference in medical devices and public health. I guess FDA is

1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:42.320
 not designed for this public health, especially in emergency situations. And they actually

1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:47.440
 explicitly say that. I mean, when I go and talk to Tim, he's a very reasonable guy.

1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:55.920
 But when I talk to him, he says, look, we don't, we just do not evaluate a public health tool. If

1:09:55.920 --> 1:10:02.560
 you're telling me this is a public health tool, great, go and use it. And so I say, okay, great,

1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:09.040
 we'll go and use it. And then the comment is, but does it give a result back to somebody? I say,

1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:13.360
 well, yes, of course it gives a result back to somebody. It's being done in their home. So

1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:17.920
 well, then it's defined as a medical tool. Can't use it. So it's stuck in this gray zone where

1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:24.480
 unfortunately, there's this weird definition that any tool, any test that gives a result back to

1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:32.560
 an individual is defined by CMS, Centers for Medicaid Services as a medical device requiring

1:10:32.560 --> 1:10:38.000
 medical authorization. But then you go and ask, it gets crazier because then you go and ask

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:47.600
 Seema Verma, the head of CMS, okay, can these be authorized as public health tools and not

1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:52.640
 fall under your definition of a medical device? So then the FDA doesn't have to be the ones authorizing

1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:59.200
 it as a public health tool. And Seema Verma says, oh, well, we don't have any jurisdiction over

1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:06.560
 point of care and sort of rapid devices like this. We only have jurisdiction over lab devices.

1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:12.240
 So it's like nobody has ownership over it, which means that they just keep, they stay in this purgatory

1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:18.240
 of not being approved. And so this is where I think, frankly, it needs a president. It needs a

1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:25.040
 presidential order to just unlock them to say, this is more important than having a prescription.

1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:31.120
 And in fact, I mean, really what's happening now because there is this sense that tests are public

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:36.800
 health tools, even if they're not being defined as such, the FDA now is pretty much, not only are

1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:43.360
 they not authorizing these as public health tools, what they're doing by authorizing what are

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:49.120
 effectively public health tools as medical devices, they're just diluting down the practice of medicine.

1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:56.000
 Right. I mean, his answer right now, unfortunately, is, well, I don't know why you want these to be

1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.560
 sort of available to everyone without a prescription. We've already said that a doctor can write

1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:06.080
 a whole prescription for a whole college campus. It's like, well, if you're going in that direction,

1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:11.360
 then that's no longer medicine. Having a doctor write a prescription for a college campus for

1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:17.760
 everyone on the campus to have repeat testing, now we're just in the territory of eroding medicine

1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:22.640
 and eroding all of the legal rules and reasons that we have prescriptions in the first place.

1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:29.440
 So it's just everything about it is just destructive instead of just making a simple solution,

1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:36.320
 which is, these are okay as public health tools as long as they meet X and Y metrics go and CDC can

1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:41.840
 put their stamp of approval on them. What do you think? Sorry if I'm stuck on this. You mentioned

1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:49.760
 of MIT and public health engineering, right? I mean, it has a sense of I talked to competition

1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:55.680
 biology folks. It's always exciting to see computer scientists start entering the space of biology.

1:12:55.680 --> 1:13:00.640
 And there's actually a lot of exciting things that happen because of that, trying to understand

1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:07.200
 the fundamentals of biology. So from the engineering approach to public health,

1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:11.360
 what kind of problems do you think can be tackled? What kind of disciplines are involved?

1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:17.520
 Like, do you have ideas in this space? Oh, yeah. I mean, I can speak to one of the major

1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:22.480
 activities that I want to do. So what I normally do in my research lab is develop

1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:29.920
 technologies that can take a drop of somebody's blood or some saliva and profile for hundreds of

1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:34.640
 thousands of different antibodies against every single pathogen that somebody could be possibly

1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:41.360
 exposed to. So this is all new technology that we've been developing more from a bioengineering

1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:49.920
 perspective. But then I use a lot of the mathematics tools to interpret that. But what I really want

1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:54.560
 to do, for example, to kind of kick off this new field of what I consider public health

1:13:54.560 --> 1:14:02.160
 engineering is to create, maybe it's a little ambitious, but create a weather system for viruses.

1:14:02.160 --> 1:14:08.640
 I want us to be able to open up our iPhones, plug in our zip code, and get a better sense,

1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:14.000
 get a probability of why my kid has a runny nose today. Is it COVID? Is it a rhinovirus?

1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:20.960
 An adenovirus or is it flu? And we can do that. We can start building the rules of virus spread

1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:28.720
 across the globe, both for pandemic preparedness, but also for just everyday use. In the same way

1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:33.360
 that people used to think that predicting the weather was going to be impossible. Of course,

1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:38.960
 we know that's not impossible now. Is it always perfect? No. But does it offer, does it completely

1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:46.720
 change the way that we go about our days? Absolutely. I envision, for example, right now,

1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:51.680
 we open up our iPhone, we plug in a zip code, and if it tells us it's going to rain today,

1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:58.320
 we bring an umbrella. So in the future, it tells us, hey, there's a lot of SARS code too in your

1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:03.760
 community. Instead of grabbing your umbrella, you grab your mask. We don't have to have masks all the

1:15:03.760 --> 1:15:10.080
 time. But if we know the rules of the game that these viruses play by, we can start preparing

1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:16.880
 for those. And every year, we go into every flu season blindfolded with our hands tied behind

1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:25.840
 our back, just saying, I hope this isn't a bad flu season this year. We're in the 21st century.

1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:33.200
 We have the tools at our disposal now to not have that attitude. This isn't like

1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:42.640
 1920s. We can just say, hey, this is going to be a bad flu season this year. Let's act accordingly

1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:50.400
 and with a targeted approach. For example, we don't just use our umbrellas all day long every

1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:56.000
 single day in case it might rain. We don't board up our homes every single day in case it's a

1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:01.600
 hurricane. We wait, and if we know that there's one coming, then we act for a small period of

1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:07.360
 time accordingly. And then we go back and we've prepared ourselves in these little bursts to

1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:13.280
 not have it ruin our days. I can't tell you how exciting that vision of the future is. I think

1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:20.960
 that's incredible. And it seems like it should be within our reach. Just these weather maps of

1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:28.640
 viruses floating about the earth. And it seems obvious. It's one of those things where right now

1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:36.880
 it seems like maybe impossible. And then looking back like 20 years from now, we'll wonder why

1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:42.560
 the hell this hasn't been done way earlier. Though one difference between weather, I don't know if

1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:48.160
 you have interesting ideas in this space. The difference between weather and viruses is it

1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:57.280
 includes the collection of the data, includes the human body potentially. And that means that

1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:02.720
 there is some, as with the contact tracing question, there's some concern about privacy.

1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:10.240
 There seems to be this dance that's really complicated with Facebook getting a lot of

1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:17.360
 flack for basically misusing people's data or just whether it's perception or reality,

1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:23.600
 there's certainly a lot of reality to it too, whether they're not good stewards of our private

1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:33.280
 data. So there's this weird place where it's obvious that if we collect a lot of data about

1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:41.360
 human beings and maintain privacy and maintain all basic respect for that data, just like

1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:46.240
 honestly common sense respect for the data, then we can do a lot of amazing things for the world,

1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:52.320
 like a weather map for viruses. Is there a way forward to gain trust of people

1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:57.600
 or to do this well? Do you have ideas here? How big is this problem?

1:17:57.600 --> 1:18:02.560
 I think it's the central problem. There's a couple central problems that need to be solved.

1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:08.320
 One, how do you get all the samples? That's not actually too difficult. I actually have a pilot

1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:14.960
 project going right now with getting samples from across all the United States. Tens of thousands

1:18:14.960 --> 1:18:22.160
 of samples every week are flowing into my lab and we process them. So it's taking like one of the

1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:28.320
 basically this biology here in chemistry and converting that into numbers. That's exactly

1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:32.240
 right. So what we're doing, for example, there's a lot of people who go to the hospital every day,

1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:38.320
 a lot of people who donate blood, people who donate plasma. So one of the projects that I have,

1:18:38.320 --> 1:18:42.240
 I'll get to the privacy question in a moment, but this, so what I want to do is that the name

1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:48.320
 that I've given this is a global immunological observatory. There's no reason not to have that.

1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:53.920
 Good name. I've said, instead of saying, well, how do we possibly get enough people on board to

1:18:53.920 --> 1:18:59.520
 send in samples all the time? Well, just go to the source. So there's a company in Massachusetts

1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:06.240
 that makes 80% of all the instruments that are used globally to collect plasma from plasma donors.

1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:15.360
 So I went to this company, Hemenetics, and said, is there a way you have 80% of the global market

1:19:15.360 --> 1:19:23.440
 on plasma donations? Can we start getting plasma samples from healthy people that use your machines?

1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:28.000
 So that hooked me up with this company called Octafarma. And Octafarma has a huge reach

1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:33.360
 and offices all over the country where they're just collecting people's plasma. They actually pay

1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:37.440
 people for their plasma, and then that gets distributed to hospitals and all this stuff

1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:44.400
 is anonymous plasma. So I've just been collecting anonymous samples. And we're processing them,

1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:49.680
 in this case, for COVID antibodies to watch from January up through December, we're able to

1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:56.640
 watch how the virus entered into the United States and how it's transmitting every day

1:19:56.640 --> 1:20:02.960
 across the US. So we're getting those results organized now, and we're going to start

1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:08.800
 putting them publicly online soon to start making at least a very rough map of COVID.

1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:16.320
 But that's the type of thinking that I have in terms of like, how do you actually capture huge

1:20:16.320 --> 1:20:21.280
 numbers of specimens? You can't ask everyone to participate on sort of a, I mean, you maybe

1:20:21.280 --> 1:20:26.000
 could if you have the right tools, and you can offer individuals something in return like 23 in

1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:31.120
 me does. That's a great way to get people to give specimens and they get results back. So

1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:36.480
 with these technologies that I've been building, along with some collaborators at Harvard, we can

1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:42.640
 come up with tools that people might actually want. So I can offer you your immunological history. I

1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:48.960
 can say, give me a drop of your blood on a filter paper, mail it in, and I will be able to tell you

1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:53.600
 every infectious disease you've ever encountered, and maybe even when you encountered it roughly.

1:20:54.720 --> 1:20:59.440
 I could tell you, do you have COVID antibodies right now? Do you have Lyme disease antibodies

1:20:59.440 --> 1:21:06.000
 right now? Flu, triple E, and all these different viruses, also peanut allergies, milk allergies,

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:12.800
 anything. If your immune system makes a response to it, we can detect that response.

1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:18.400
 So all of a sudden, we have this very valuable technology that on the one hand,

1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:22.640
 gives people maybe information they might want to know about themselves. But on the other hand,

1:21:22.640 --> 1:21:29.680
 becomes this amazingly rich source of big data to enter into this global immunological observatory

1:21:29.680 --> 1:21:34.800
 sort of mathematical framework to start building these maps, these epidemiological tools. But

1:21:34.800 --> 1:21:41.200
 you ask about privacy. And absolutely, that's essential to keep in mind, first and foremost.

1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:48.240
 So privacy can be, you can keep these samples 100% anonymous. They're just, when I get them,

1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:52.880
 they show up with nothing. They're literally just tubes. I know a date that they were collected and

1:21:52.880 --> 1:22:01.120
 a zip code that they're collected from or even just sort of a county level ID. With an IRB and

1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:04.960
 with ethical approval and with the people's consent, we can maybe collect more data,

1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:10.480
 but that would require consent. But then there's this other approach, which I'm really excited

1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:15.440
 about, which is certainly going to gain some scrutiny, I think. But we'll have to figure out

1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:20.560
 where it comes into play. But I've been recognizing that we can take somebody's

1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:26.000
 immunological profile, and we can make a biological fingerprint out of it. And it's

1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:29.680
 actually stable enough so that I could take your blood. Let's say I don't know who you are,

1:22:29.680 --> 1:22:35.760
 but you sent me a drop of blood a year ago, and then you sent me a drop of blood today.

1:22:36.400 --> 1:22:40.560
 I don't know that those two blood spots are coming from the same person. They're just showing up

1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:49.680
 in my lab. But I can run our technology over, and it just gives me your immunological history.

1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:54.000
 But your immunological history is so unique to you, and the way that your body responds to these

1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:00.160
 pathogens is so unique to you that I can use that to tether your two samples. I don't know who you

1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:06.400
 are. I know nothing about you. I only know when those samples came out of a person,

1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:10.720
 but I can say, oh, these two samples a year apart actually belong to the same person.

1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:15.200
 Yeah, so there's sufficient information in that immunological history to match the samples.

1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:20.160
 Or from a privacy perspective, that's really exciting. Does that generally hold for humans?

1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:25.200
 So you're saying there's enough uniqueness to match? Yeah, because it's very stochastic,

1:23:25.200 --> 1:23:29.280
 even twins. So this, I believe, we haven't published this yet. We will soon.

1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:32.320
 You have a twin too, right? I do have a twin. I have an identical twin brother,

1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:37.280
 which makes me interested in this. He looks very much like me. Oh, is that how that works?

1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:45.600
 And DNA can't really tell us apart. But this tool is one of the only tools in the world that

1:23:45.600 --> 1:23:50.800
 could tell twins apart from each other, could still be accurate enough to say this blood,

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:59.280
 it's like 99.999% accurate to say that these two blood samples came from the same individual.

1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:04.000
 And it's because it's a combination both of your immunological history,

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:11.440
 but also how your unique body responds to a pathogen, which is random. The way that we

1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:18.160
 make antibodies is by and large, it's got an element of randomness to it. How the cells,

1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:23.440
 when they make an antibody, they chop up the genetic code to say, okay, this is the antibody

1:24:23.440 --> 1:24:28.480
 that I'm going to form for this pathogen. And you might form, if you get a coronavirus, for

1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:33.120
 example, you might form hundreds of different antibodies, not just one antibody against the

1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:37.520
 spike protein, but hundreds of different antibodies against all different parts of the virus.

1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:42.880
 So that gives this really rich resolution of information, that when I then do the same thing

1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:46.320
 across hundreds of different pathogens, some of which you've seen, some of which you haven't,

1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:53.680
 it gives you an exceedingly unique fingerprint that is sufficiently stable over years and years

1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:58.720
 and years to essentially give you a barcode. And I don't have to know who you are,

1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:02.800
 but I can know that these two specimens came from the same person somewhere out in the world.

1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:08.800
 It's so fascinating that there's this trace, your life story in the space of viruses,

1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:19.040
 in the space of pathogen. Because there's this entire universe of these organisms that are trying to

1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:26.480
 destroy each other. And then your little trajectory through that space leaves a trace. And then you

1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:34.560
 can look at that trace. That's fascinating. And that data period is just fascinating. And the

1:25:34.560 --> 1:25:42.800
 vision of making that data universally connected to where you can make, like infer things, and just

1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:47.920
 like with the weather is really fascinating. And there's probably artificial intelligence

1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:51.120
 applications there, start making predictions, start finding patterns.

1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:57.520
 Exactly. We're doing a lot of that already. And that's how we had this going. I've been

1:25:57.520 --> 1:26:03.040
 trying to get this funded for years now. And I've spoken to governments, everyone says,

1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:09.040
 cool idea, not going to do it. Why do we need it? Oh, really? The why do you need it?

1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:13.920
 The why do you need it? And of course now, I've wrote in 2015 about this,

1:26:13.920 --> 1:26:20.320
 why this would be useful. And of course, now we're seeing why it would be useful.

1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:29.920
 Had we had this up and running in 2019, had we had it going, we were getting blood samples from

1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:36.880
 hospitals and clinics and blood donors from New York City, let's just say. We didn't run the

1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:44.640
 first PCR test for coronavirus until probably a month and a half or two months after the virus

1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:49.280
 started transmitting in New York City. So it's like with the rain, we didn't start wearing umbrellas

1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:53.840
 or taking out umbrellas. Exactly, for two months. It's getting wet.

1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:56.800
 But different than the rain, we couldn't actually see that it was spreading.

1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:03.280
 And so Andrew Cuomo had no choice but to leave the city open. They were hints that maybe the

1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:08.480
 virus was spreading in New York City, but he didn't have any data to back it up. No data.

1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:17.280
 And so it was just week on week on week. And he didn't have any information to really go by to

1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:21.200
 allow him to have the firepower to say, we're closing down the city. This is an emergency,

1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:28.160
 we have to stop spread before it starts. And so they waited until the first PCR test

1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:30.960
 were coming about. And then the moment they started running PCR tests, they find out it's

1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:38.320
 everywhere. And so that was a disaster because of course New York City, it was just hit so bad

1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:43.680
 because nobody was, we were blind to it. We didn't have to be blind to it. And the nice thing about

1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:49.360
 this technology is we wouldn't have, with the exact same technology we had in 2017,

1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:55.600
 we could have detected this novel coronavirus spreading in New York City in 2020,

1:27:55.600 --> 1:28:00.800
 not because we changed, not because we are actually actively looking for this novel coronavirus,

1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:06.160
 but because we would see, we would have seen patterns in people's immune responses using AI

1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:12.400
 or just frankly using our just the raw data itself. We could have said, hey, it looks like there's

1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:18.160
 something that looks like known coronavirus is spreading in New York, but there's gaps.

1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:21.840
 You know, there's, for some reason, people aren't developing an immune response to this

1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:26.560
 coronavirus that seems to be spreading to these normal things that, you know, and it just looks,

1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:32.320
 the profile looks different. And we could have seen that and immediately, especially since we

1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:38.480
 had an idea that there was a novel coronavirus circulating in the world, we could have very

1:28:38.480 --> 1:28:43.600
 quickly and easily seen, hey, clearly we're seeing a spike of something that looks like a known

1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:48.960
 coronavirus, but people are responding weirdly to it. Our AI algorithms would have picked it up

1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:54.480
 and just our basic heck, you could have put it in an Excel spreadsheet, we would have seen it.

1:28:56.400 --> 1:29:00.080
 Some basic visualization would have shown that. Exactly. We would have seen spikes and they would

1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:04.720
 have been kind of like off, you know, immune responses that the shape of them just looked

1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:08.800
 a little bit different, but they would have been growing and we would have seen it and it could

1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:13.920
 have saved tens of thousands of lives in New York City. So to me, the fascinating question,

1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:17.440
 everything we've talked about, so both the huge collection of data at scale,

1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:26.240
 which is super exciting. And then the kind of obvious at scale solution to the current virus

1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:35.280
 and future ones is the rapid testing. Can we talk about the future of viruses that might be

1:29:35.280 --> 1:29:44.320
 threatening the, our very existence? So do you think like a future natural virus can

1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:52.080
 have an order of magnitude greater effect on human civilization than anything we've ever seen?

1:29:52.080 --> 1:30:01.920
 So something that either kills all humans or kills, I don't know, 60, 70% of humans. So some

1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:08.480
 like something, something we can't even imagine. Is that, is that something that you think is

1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:15.760
 possible? Because it seems to have not happened yet. So maybe like the entirety, whoever, whoever

1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:21.280
 the programmer is of the simulation that sort of launched the evolution for the Big Bang,

1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:26.320
 seems to not want to destroy us humans. Or maybe that's a natural side effect of the

1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:32.240
 evolutionary process that humans are useful. But do you think it's possible that the evolutionary

1:30:32.240 --> 1:30:37.920
 process will produce a virus that will kill all humans? I think it could. I don't think it's likely.

1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:43.120
 And the reason I don't think it's likely is, well, on the one hand, it hasn't happened yet,

1:30:44.960 --> 1:30:53.840
 in part because mobility is a recent phenomena. People weren't particularly mobile until

1:30:55.280 --> 1:31:00.560
 fairly recently. Now, of course, now that we have people flying back and forth across the globe all

1:31:00.560 --> 1:31:09.120
 the time, the chances of global pandemics has escalated exponentially, of course. And so

1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:14.160
 on the one hand, that's part of why it hasn't happened yet. We can look at things like Ebola.

1:31:14.800 --> 1:31:21.760
 Now, Ebola, we don't, we haven't generally had major Ebola epidemics in the past, not because

1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:26.960
 Ebola wasn't transmitting and infecting humans, but because they were, it was largely affecting

1:31:26.960 --> 1:31:34.880
 and infecting humans in disconnected communities. So you see in rural parts of Africa, for example,

1:31:35.680 --> 1:31:41.200
 in Western Africa, you might end up having isolated Ebola outbreaks, but there weren't

1:31:41.840 --> 1:31:45.600
 connections that were fast enough that would allow people to then spread it

1:31:45.600 --> 1:31:57.440
 into the cities. Of course, we saw back in 2014, 15 massive Ebola outbreak that wasn't

1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:02.320
 because it was a new strain of Ebola, but it was because there's new inroads and connections

1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:07.280
 between the communities and people got it to the city. And so we saw it start to spread.

1:32:08.240 --> 1:32:15.200
 So that should be a little bit foreshadowing of what's to come. And now we have this pandemic,

1:32:15.200 --> 1:32:24.240
 we had 2009, we have this. There is a benefit, or there is sort of a natural check. And this is

1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:30.480
 like kind of Latke Voltaire predator prey dynamic kind of systems, ecological systems and mathematics

1:32:30.480 --> 1:32:39.840
 that if you have something that's so deadly, people will respond more, maybe with a greater panic,

1:32:39.840 --> 1:32:44.480
 a greater sense of panic, which alone could destroy humanity. But at the same time,

1:32:44.480 --> 1:32:49.680
 like we now know that we can lock down. We know that that's possible. And so if this

1:32:49.680 --> 1:32:54.400
 was a worse virus that was actually killing 60% of people who was infecting, we would lock down

1:32:54.400 --> 1:33:00.960
 very quickly. My biggest fear though is let's say that was happening. You need serious lockdowns if

1:33:00.960 --> 1:33:05.440
 you're going to keep things going. So the only reason we were able to keep things going during

1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:10.320
 our lockdowns is because it wasn't so bad that we were still able to have people work in the

1:33:10.320 --> 1:33:15.920
 grocery stores. Still people work in the shipping to get the food onto the shelves.

1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:19.760
 So on the one hand, we could probably figure out how to stop the virus,

1:33:21.120 --> 1:33:27.040
 but can we stop the virus without starving? And I'm not sure that that if this was

1:33:28.080 --> 1:33:34.720
 another acute respiratory virus that say it transmitted the same way, but say it actually

1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:39.520
 did worse damage to your heart. But it was like a month later that people started having heart attacks

1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:48.160
 in mass. It's like not just one offs, but really severe. Well, that could be a serious problem for

1:33:48.160 --> 1:33:55.600
 humanity. So in some ways, I think that there are lots of ways that we could end up dying at the

1:33:55.600 --> 1:34:01.360
 hand of a virus. I mean, we're already seeing it. I mean, my fear is still, I think coronaviruses

1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:08.400
 have demonstrated a keen ability to destroy or to create outbreaks that can potentially be deadly

1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:14.400
 to large numbers of people. Flu strains, though, are still by and large my concern.

1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:18.560
 So you think the bad one might come from the flu, the influenza?

1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:23.680
 Yeah, their replication cycle, they're able to genetically recombine in a way that coronaviruses

1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:28.160
 aren't. They have segmented genomes, which means that they can just swap out whole parts of their

1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:34.560
 genomes, no problem, repackage them, and then boom, you have a whole antigenic shift, not a drift.

1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:41.040
 What that means is that on any occasion, any day of the year, you can have, boom, a new,

1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:47.760
 whole new virus that didn't exist yesterday. And now with farming and industrial livestock,

1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:56.960
 we're seeing animals and humans come into contact much more. Just the opportunities for an

1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:04.160
 influenza strain that is unique and deadly to humans increases all the while transmission and

1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:08.160
 mobility has increased. It's just a matter of time, in my opinion.

1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:16.800
 What about from an immunology perspective of the idea of engineering a virus? So not just

1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:23.440
 the virus leaking from a lab or something, but actually being able to understand the protein,

1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:29.680
 like the everything about what makes a virus enough to be able to figure out ways to

1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:36.000
 maybe targeted or untargeted attack by...

1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:36.960
 It's the birth immunity.

1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:46.000
 Yeah. Is that something, obviously that's somewhere on the list of concerns,

1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:51.440
 but is that anywhere close of the top 10 highlights along with nuclear weapons and so on

1:35:51.440 --> 1:35:56.400
 that we should be worried about? Or is the natural pandemic really the one that's much

1:35:56.400 --> 1:36:05.280
 great a concern? I would say that the former, that manmade viruses and genetically engineered

1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:10.320
 viruses should be right up there with the greatest concerns for humanity right now.

1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:18.400
 We know that the tools for better or worse, the tools for creating a virus are there.

1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:27.920
 We can do it. I mean, heck, the human species is no longer vaccinated against smallpox.

1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:31.920
 I didn't get a smallpox vaccine. You didn't get a smallpox vaccine, at least I don't think.

1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:40.960
 So if somebody wanted to make smallpox and distribute it to the world in some way,

1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:52.080
 it could be exceedingly deadly and detrimental to humans and that's not even using your imagination

1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:57.440
 to create a new virus. That's one that we already have. Unlike the past, when smallpox would

1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:02.400
 circulate, you had large fractions of the community that was already immune to it.

1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:07.200
 And so it wouldn't spread or it would spread a little bit slower, but now we have essentially,

1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:13.600
 in a few years, we'll have a whole global population that is susceptible. Let's look at measles.

1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:21.360
 We have an entire, I mean, measles. There are some researchers in the world right now which,

1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:27.680
 for various reasons, are working on creating a measles strain that evades immunity. It's not

1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:32.000
 for bioterrorism, at least that's not the expectation. It's for using measles as an

1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:38.640
 oncolytic virus to kill cancer. And the only way you can really do that is if your immune system

1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:42.640
 doesn't, you know, if you take a measles virus and there's, you know, we don't have to go into

1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:47.440
 the details of why it would work, but it could work. Measles likes to target potentially cancer

1:37:47.440 --> 1:37:52.640
 cells. But to get your immune system not to kill off the virus, if you're trying to use the virus

1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:58.880
 to target it, you maybe want to make it blind to the immune system. But now imagine we took some

1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:04.800
 virus like measles, which has an R0 of 18, transmits extremely quickly. And now we have

1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:11.120
 essentially, let's say we had a whole human race that is susceptible to measles. And this is a virus

1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:19.360
 that spreads orders of magnitude easier than this current virus. Imagine if you were to plug something

1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:23.920
 toxic or detrimental into that virus and release it to the world.

1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:30.640
 So it's possible to be both accidental and intentional? Absolutely. Yeah, an accident. So

1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:36.400
 Mark Lipsitch is a good colleague of mine at Harvard. We're both in the, he's the director

1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:42.160
 of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics from a faculty member. He's spoken very, very

1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:48.560
 forcefully and he's very outspoken about the dangers of gain of function testing,

1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:56.160
 where in the lab we are intentionally creating viruses that are exceedingly deadly under the

1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:02.000
 auspices of trying to learn about them. So that if the idea is that if we kind of accelerate

1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:08.560
 evolution and make these really deadly viruses in the lab, we can be prepared for if that virus

1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:16.400
 ever comes about naturally or through unnatural means. The concern though is, okay, that's one

1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:26.800
 thing, but what if that virus got out on somebody's shoe? Just what if? If the effects of an accident

1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:34.160
 are potentially catastrophic, is it worth taking the chances just to be prepared a little bit for

1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:39.840
 something that may or may not ever actually develop? And so it's a serious ethical quandary

1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:48.480
 we're in. How to both be prepared, but also not cause a catastrophic mistake.

1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:54.800
 As a small tangent, there's a recent really exciting breakthrough of Alpha 2,

1:39:56.160 --> 1:40:00.960
 of Alpha Fold 2 solving protein folding or achieving state of the art performance on

1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:09.760
 protein folding. And then I thought, proteins have a lot to do with viruses. It seems like

1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:19.440
 being able to use machine learning to design proteins that achieve certain kinds of functions

1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:26.000
 will naturally allow you to use, maybe down the line, not yet, but allow you to use machine

1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:32.880
 learning to design basically viruses, maybe like measles for good, which is like to attack

1:40:32.880 --> 1:40:45.200
 cancer cells, but also for bad. Is that a crazy thought or is this a natural place where this

1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:52.240
 technology may go? I suppose all technologies can, which is for good and for bad. Do you think

1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:59.280
 about the role of machine learning in this? Oh yeah, absolutely. Alpha Fold is amazing.

1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:08.160
 It's an amazing algorithm, series of algorithms. And it does demonstrate, to me, it demonstrates

1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:14.240
 just how powerful everything in the world has rules. We just don't know the rules. We often

1:41:14.240 --> 1:41:19.200
 don't know them, but our brain has rules, how it works. Everything is plus and minus. There's

1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:26.480
 nothing in the world that's really not at its most basic level, positive, negative. Obviously,

1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:32.480
 it's all just charge. And that means everything. You can figure it out with enough computational

1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:40.240
 power and enough. In this case, machine learning and AI is just one way to learn rules. It's an

1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:50.320
 empirical way to learn rules, but it's a profoundly powerful way. And certainly, now that we are

1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:57.280
 getting to a point where we can take a protein and know how it folds, given its sequence,

1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:04.080
 we can reverse engineer that and we can say, okay, we want a protein to fold this way. What

1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:10.400
 does the sequence need to be? We haven't done that yet so much, but it's just the next iteration of

1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:16.320
 all of this. So let's say somebody wants to develop a virus. It's going to start with somebody wanting

1:42:16.320 --> 1:42:22.880
 to develop a virus to defeat cancer, something good. And so it will start with a lot of money

1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:28.160
 from the federal government for all the positives that will come out of it.

1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:36.000
 But we have to be really careful because that will come about. There's no doubt in my mind

1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:39.600
 that we will develop, we're already doing it. We engineer molecules all the time

1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:43.920
 for specific uses. Oftentimes, we take them from nature and then tweak them.

1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:51.680
 But now we can supercharge it. We can accelerate the pace of discovery. To not have it just be

1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:59.200
 discovery, we have it be true ground up engineering. Let's say you're trying to make a new molecule

1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:06.880
 to stabilize somebody with some retinal disease. So we come up with some molecule that can

1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:16.320
 improve the stability of somebody with retinal degeneration. Just a small tweak to that to

1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:21.520
 say make a virus that causes the human race to become blind. It sounds really conspiracy

1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:28.080
 theoryish, but it's not. We're learning so much about biology and there's always an

1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:38.480
 affair. Heck, look at how AI and just Google searches, they are every single day being leveraged

1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:44.400
 by nefarious actors to take advantage of people, to steal money, to do whatever it might be,

1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:51.920
 eventually probably to create wars or already to create wars. And I don't think there's any

1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:57.040
 question at this point behind disinformation campaigns. And so it's being leveraged, this

1:43:57.040 --> 1:44:02.640
 thing that could be wholly good, it's always going to be leveraged for bad. And so how do

1:44:02.640 --> 1:44:08.160
 you balance that as a species? I'm not quite sure. The hope is, as you mentioned previously,

1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:12.800
 that there's some that we were able to also develop defense mechanisms. And there's something

1:44:12.800 --> 1:44:20.800
 about the human species that seems to keep coming up with ways to just like on the deadline,

1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:29.120
 just at the last moment, figuring out how to avoid destruction. I think I'm like eternally

1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:34.320
 optimistic about the human race not destroying ourselves, but you could do a lot of things

1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:40.880
 that would be very painful. Yes. What we're doing it already, just, I mean, we are seeing how our

1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:46.800
 regulation today. Right. We did this thing, it started as a good thing, regulation of medical

1:44:46.800 --> 1:44:56.960
 products. But now it is unwillingly and unintentionally harming us. Our regulatory landscape,

1:44:56.960 --> 1:45:03.200
 which was developed wholly for good in our country, is getting in the way of us deploying a tool

1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:12.080
 that could stop our economies from having to be sputteringly closed, that could stop deaths

1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:19.600
 from happening at the rate that they are. I think we will come to a solution. Of course,

1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:23.920
 now we're going to get the vaccine and it's going to make people lose track of why we even

1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:29.680
 bother testing, which is a bad idea. But we're already seeing that we have this amazing capacity

1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:38.480
 to both do damage when we don't intend to do damage and then also to pull up when we need to

1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:45.920
 pull up and stop complete catastrophe. And so we are an interesting species in that way,

1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:52.480
 that's for sure. So there's a lot of young folks undergrads. Grads, they're also young.

1:45:53.280 --> 1:45:58.800
 Listen to this. So you've talked about a lot of fascinating stuff that's like, there's

1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:05.680
 ways that things are done and there's actual solutions and they're not always intersecting.

1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:11.840
 Do you have advice for undergraduate students or graduate students or even people in high school

1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:19.920
 now about life, about career, how they might be able to solve real big problems in the world,

1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:24.480
 how they should live their life in order to have a chance to solve big problems in the world?

1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:29.920
 It's hard. I struggle a little bit sometimes to give advice because the advice that I give

1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:34.800
 from my own personal experience is necessarily distinct from the advice that would make other

1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:44.320
 people successful. I have unending ambitions to make things better. And I don't see barricades

1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:50.160
 where other people sometimes see barricades. Now, even just little things, like when this

1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:55.600
 virus started, I'm a medical director at Brigham and Women's Hospital. And so I oversee or helped

1:46:55.600 --> 1:47:02.080
 oversee molecular virology diagnostics. So when this virus started, wearing my epidemiology hat

1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:06.960
 and wearing my viral outbreak hat, I recognized that this is going to be a big virus that was

1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:11.840
 important at a global level. Even if the CDC and WHO weren't ready to admit that it was a pandemic,

1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:18.160
 it was obvious in January that it was a pandemic. So I started trying to get a test built at the

1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:25.840
 Brigham, which is one of Harvard's teaching hospitals. The first encounters I had with

1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:29.840
 the upper administration of the hospital were pretty much, no, why would we do that? That's

1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:36.160
 silly. Who are you? And I said, well, okay, don't believe me, sure. But I kept pushing on it.

1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:42.160
 And then eventually I got them to agree. It was really only a couple of weeks before the

1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:46.960
 Biogen conference happened. We started building the test. I think they started looking abroad and

1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:53.680
 saying, okay, this is happening. Sure. Maybe he was right. But then I went a step further and I said,

1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:59.440
 we're not going to have enough tests at the hospital. And so my ambition was to get a better

1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:05.920
 testing program started. And so I figured what better place to scale up testing than the Broad

1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:11.600
 Institute? Broad Institute is amazing, very high throughput, high efficiency research institute

1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:16.240
 that does a lot of genomic sequencing, things like that. So I went to the Broad and I said,

1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:22.640
 hey, there's this coronavirus that's obviously going to impact our society greatly. Can we start

1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:30.080
 modifying your high efficiency instruments and robots for coronavirus testing? Everyone in my

1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:38.080
 orbit in the hospital world just said, that's ridiculous. How could you possibly plan to do

1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:47.200
 that? It's impossible. And to me, it was the most dead simple thing to do. But the higher ups and

1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:51.840
 the people who think about, I think one of the most important things is to recognize that most

1:48:51.840 --> 1:48:56.240
 people in the world don't see solutions. They just see problems. And it's because it's an easy

1:48:56.240 --> 1:49:04.320
 thing to do. Thinking of problems and how things will go wrong is really easy because you're not

1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:08.800
 coming up with a brand new solution. And this to me was just a super simple solution. Hey,

1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:14.080
 let's get the Broad to help build tests. Every single hospital director told me no,

1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:19.440
 like it's impossible. My own superiors, the ones I report to in the hospital said, Mike,

1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:26.960
 you're a new faculty member. Your ideas probably would be right, but you're too naive and young

1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:33.520
 to know that it's impossible. And obviously, now the Broad is the highest throughput laboratory in

1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:41.280
 the country. And so I think my recommendation to people is as much as possible, get out of the

1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:47.920
 mode of thinking about things as problems. Sometimes you piss people off. I could probably

1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:55.040
 use a better filter sometimes to try to be not so upfront with certain things. But it's just so

1:49:55.040 --> 1:50:00.400
 crucial to always just see, to just bring it, like think about things in new ways that other

1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:05.120
 people haven't because usually there's something else out there. And one of the things that has

1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:11.040
 been most beneficial to me, which is that my education was really broad. It was engineering

1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:16.880
 and physics. And well, and then I became a Buddhist monk for a while. And so that gave me a different

1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:23.200
 perspective. But then it was medicine and immunology. And now I've brought all of it together from

1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:30.080
 mathematics and biology and medicine, perspective, and policy and public health. And I think that

1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:35.600
 I'm not the best in any one of these things. I recognize that there are going to be geniuses

1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:40.560
 out there who are just worlds better than me at any one of these things that I try to work on.

1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:45.360
 But my superpower is bringing them all together and just thinking, and that's,

1:50:45.360 --> 1:50:51.440
 I think, how you can really change the world. I don't know that I'll ever change the world

1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:55.200
 in the way that I hope. But that's how you can have a chance.

1:50:55.200 --> 1:51:00.000
 Yeah, that's how you can have a chance, exactly. And I think it's also what,

1:51:00.640 --> 1:51:06.000
 this to me, this rapid testing program, this is the most dead simple solution in the world.

1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:09.680
 And this literally could change the world. It could change the world. And it is. There's

1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:13.840
 countries that are doing it now. The US isn't, but I've been advising many countries on it.

1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:20.400
 And I would say that some of the early papers that we put out earlier on, a lot of the things

1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:25.520
 actually are changing. Unless you really look hard, you don't know where you're actually having

1:51:25.520 --> 1:51:32.880
 an effect. Sometimes it's more overt than other times. In April, I published a paper that was

1:51:32.880 --> 1:51:38.400
 saying, hey, with the PCR values from these tests, we need to really focus on the CT values,

1:51:38.400 --> 1:51:44.640
 the actual quantitative values of these lab based PCR tests. At the time, all the physicians

1:51:44.640 --> 1:51:48.560
 and laboratory directors told me that was stupid. Why would you do that? They're not

1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:54.640
 accurate enough. And of course, now it's headline news that Florida, they just mandated

1:51:54.640 --> 1:51:58.800
 reporting out the CT values of these tests because there's a real utility of them.

1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:02.240
 You can understand public health from it. You can understand better clinical management.

1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:10.160
 And that was a simple solution to a pretty difficult problem. And it is changing the way

1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:14.480
 that we approach all of the lab testing in this country is starting to, it's taken a few months,

1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:20.080
 but it's starting to change because of that. And that was just me saying, hey, this is something

1:52:20.080 --> 1:52:25.200
 we should be focusing on. Got some other people involved and other people. And now people recognize,

1:52:25.200 --> 1:52:30.720
 hey, there's actual value in this number that comes out of these lab based PCR tests. So sometimes

1:52:30.720 --> 1:52:39.120
 it does grow fairly quickly. But I think the real answer, my only answer, I don't know what,

1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:43.520
 I recognize that everyone, some people are going to be really focused on and have one small,

1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:49.600
 but deep skill set. I go the opposite direction. I try to bring things together.

1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:56.080
 But the biggest thing I think is just don't see barriers. Just see,

1:52:56.080 --> 1:53:01.040
 like, there's always a solution to a barrier. If there's a barrier that literally means a

1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:05.840
 solution to it, that's why it's called a barrier. And just like you said, most people will just

1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:10.960
 present to you, only be thinking about it and present to you with barriers. And so it's easy

1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:16.480
 to start thinking that's all there is in this world. And just think big. I mean, God, there's

1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:22.240
 nothing wrong with thinking big. Elon Musk thought big. And, you know, and then thinking big builds

1:53:22.240 --> 1:53:27.440
 on itself, you know, you get a billion dollars from one big idea and then that allows you to

1:53:27.440 --> 1:53:31.680
 make three new big ideas. And there's a hunger for it. If you think big and you communicate

1:53:31.680 --> 1:53:36.720
 that vision with the world, all the most brilliant and like passionate people will just like,

1:53:37.600 --> 1:53:41.440
 you'll attract them and they'll come to you. And then it makes your life actually really

1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:47.600
 exciting. The people I've met at like Tesla and Neuralink, I mean, there's just like this fire

1:53:47.600 --> 1:53:52.960
 in their eyes. They just love life. And it's amazing, I think, to be around those people.

1:53:54.400 --> 1:54:01.200
 I have to ask you about what was the philosophy, the journey that took you to becoming a Buddhist

1:54:01.200 --> 1:54:08.960
 monk? And what were, what did you learn about life? What did you take away from that experience?

1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:16.480
 How did you return back to Harvard and the world that's unlike that experience, I imagine?

1:54:16.480 --> 1:54:18.880
 Yeah. Well, I was at Dartmouth at the time.

1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:25.920
 Well, I went to Sri Lanka. I was already pretty interested in developing countries and sort

1:54:25.920 --> 1:54:31.360
 of under resourced areas. And I was doing a lot of engineering work and I went there,

1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:35.360
 but I was also starting to think maybe health was something of interest.

1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:43.440
 And so I went to Sri Lanka because I had a long interest in Buddhism as well,

1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:49.040
 just kind of interested in it as a thing. Which aspect of the philosophy attracted you?

1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:56.480
 I would say that the thing that interested me most was really this idea of kind of a butterfly

1:54:56.480 --> 1:55:05.920
 effect of what you do now has ripple effects that extend out beyond what you can possibly imagine,

1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:12.240
 both in your own life and in other people's lives. And in some ways, Buddhism has,

1:55:12.240 --> 1:55:18.000
 not in some ways, in a pretty deep way. Buddhism has that as part of its underlying

1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:25.200
 philosophy in terms of rebirth and sort of your actions today propagate to others,

1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:31.920
 but also propagate to sort of what might happen in your circle of what's called samsara and

1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:38.880
 rebirth. And I don't know that I subscribe fully to this idea that we are reborn,

1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:45.680
 which always was a little bit of a debate internally, I suppose when I was a monk.

1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:54.480
 But it has always been, it was that and then it was also meditation. At the time I was a fairly

1:55:54.480 --> 1:56:01.840
 elite rower. I was rowing at the national level and rowing to me was very meditative. It was

1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:08.400
 just, there's, even if you're in a boat with other people, it's, I mean, on the one hand,

1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:13.840
 it's like the extreme of like a team sport, but it's also the extreme sort of focus and

1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:18.000
 concentration that requires, that's required of it. And so I was always really into just

1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.240
 meditative type of things. I was doing a lot of pottery too, which was also very meditative.

1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:26.960
 And so Buddhism just kind of really, really, there are a lot of things about meditating

1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:34.080
 that just appealed. And so I moved to Sri Lanka planning to only be there for a couple of months.

1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:39.360
 But then I was shadowing in this medical clinic and there was this physician who was just really,

1:56:40.160 --> 1:56:44.240
 I mean, it's just kind of a horrible situation. Frankly, this guy was trained

1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:49.920
 decades earlier. He was an older physician and he was still just practicing like these

1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:54.400
 fairly barbaric approaches to medicine because he had, you know, as a rural town

1:56:55.360 --> 1:57:00.880
 and he just didn't have a lot of, he didn't have any updated training, frankly. And so,

1:57:00.880 --> 1:57:06.560
 you know, I just remember this like girl came in with like shrapnel in her hand and his solution

1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:14.880
 was to like air it out. And so he was like, without even numbing her hand, he was like cutting it

1:57:14.880 --> 1:57:21.200
 open more with this idea that like the more oxygen and stuff, you know, and it just, I think

1:57:21.200 --> 1:57:24.960
 there was something about all of this. And I was already talking to these monks at the time.

1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:31.520
 Each, I would be in this clinic in the morning and I'd go and my idea was to teach English to

1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:38.240
 these monks in the evening. Turned out I'm a really bad English teacher. So they just taught,

1:57:38.240 --> 1:57:42.320
 they allowed me just to sit with them and meditate and they were teaching me more about

1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:46.080
 Buddhism than I could have possibly taught them about English or being an American or something.

1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:55.280
 And so I just slowly, I just couldn't take, I like couldn't handle being in that clinic. So

1:57:55.280 --> 1:57:59.280
 more and more, I just started moving to, you know, spending more and more time at this monastery.

1:57:59.280 --> 1:58:02.880
 And then after about two months, I was supposed to come back to the States and I decided I didn't

1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:08.720
 want to. So I moved to this monastery in the mountains primarily because I didn't have the

1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:14.800
 money to like just keep living. So I was living in a monastery, it's free. And so I moved there

1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:22.000
 and just started meditating more and more. And then months went by and it just really gravitated.

1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:29.840
 I gravitated to the whole notion of it. I mean, it became, it sounds strange, but meditating almost,

1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:35.520
 just like anything that you put your mind to, became exciting. It became like there weren't

1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:41.360
 enough hours in the day to meditate. And I would do it for 18 hours a day, 15 hours a day,

1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:49.440
 just sit there and you, and like, I mean, I hate sleeping anyway, but I wouldn't want to go to

1:58:49.440 --> 1:58:54.000
 sleep because I felt like I didn't accomplish what I needed to accomplish in meditation that day,

1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:58.560
 which is so strange because there is no end, you know, but it was always, but there are these,

1:59:00.400 --> 1:59:04.400
 there are these steps that happen during meditation that are very prescribed in a way.

1:59:05.040 --> 1:59:08.800
 Buddha talked about them, you know, and these are ancient writings, which exist. I mean,

1:59:08.800 --> 1:59:14.320
 the writings are real. They're thousands of years old now. And, you know, so whether it was Buddha

1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:18.800
 writing them or whoever, you know, there are lots of different people who have contributed to the,

1:59:18.800 --> 1:59:25.280
 to these writings over the years. And, but they're very prescribed. And they, they tell you what

1:59:25.280 --> 1:59:30.960
 you're going to go through. And I didn't really focus too much on them. I read a little bit about

1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:35.840
 them, but your mind really does when you actually start meditating at that level, like not an hour

1:59:35.840 --> 1:59:40.960
 here and there, but like truly just spending your day is meditating. It becomes kind of like this

1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:48.800
 other world where it becomes exciting. And, and you're actively working, you're actively

1:59:48.800 --> 1:59:52.560
 meditating, not just kind of trying to quiet things. That's sort of just the first stage

1:59:53.280 --> 1:59:56.720
 of trying to get your mind to focus. Most people never get past that first stage,

1:59:56.720 --> 2:00:02.560
 especially in our culture. Could you briefly summarize what's waiting beyond the stage of

2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:09.040
 just quieting the mind? It's hard for me to imagine that there's something that could be described

2:00:09.040 --> 2:00:15.120
 as exciting on there. Yeah, it's, it's an interesting question. So I would say,

2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:22.560
 so the first thing, the first step is truly just to like be able to close your eyes, focus on your

2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:28.160
 breath and not have other thoughts enter into your mind. That alone is just so hard to do.

2:00:28.160 --> 2:00:37.440
 Like, I couldn't do it now if I wanted, but I could then. And, but once you get past that stage,

2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:42.880
 you start entering into like all these other, you go through the kind of, I went through this

2:00:42.880 --> 2:00:48.960
 like pretty trippy stage, which was a little bit euphoric, where you just kind of start not

2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:52.880
 hallucinating. I mean, it wasn't like some crazy thing that would happen in a movie where you,

2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:59.920
 but definitely just weird. You start getting to the stage where you, you're able to quiet your

2:00:59.920 --> 2:01:07.680
 mind for so long, for hours at a time that like for me, I started getting really excited about

2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:12.320
 this idea of mindfulness, which is part of, part of Buddhism in general, but it's part of

2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:20.080
 Taravanan Buddhism in particular for this, in this way, which was, you take, you start focusing

2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:28.000
 on your daily activities, whether that's sipping a cup of tea or walking or, you know, sweeping

2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:33.440
 around. I lived in, on this mountain side in this cottage thing is built into the rock and,

2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:37.920
 you know, so every morning I would wake up early and sweep around it and stuff, because that's

2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:44.640
 just what we did. And you start to, you meditate on all those activities. And one of the things

2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:52.880
 that was so exciting, which sounds completely ridiculous now, was just almost learning about

2:01:52.880 --> 2:01:57.600
 your daily activities in ways that you never would have thought about before. So what is,

2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:04.160
 what's, what's involved with like picking up this glass of water? You know, if I said,

2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:08.320
 okay, I'm just going to pick, I'm going to take a drink of water, to me right now, it's a single

2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:17.440
 activity. But during meditation, it's not a single activity. It's a whole series of

2:02:17.440 --> 2:02:24.080
 activities of like little engineering feats and feelings. And it's gripping the water.

2:02:24.080 --> 2:02:28.960
 And it's feeling that the glass is cold and it's lifting and it's moving and dragging and dragging.

2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:35.760
 And you start to learn a whole new language of life. And that to me was like this really

2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:42.480
 exhilarating thing that it was an exhilarating component of meditation that there was never

2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:47.280
 enough time, it's kind of like learning a new computer language, like it gets really exciting

2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:53.760
 when you start coding and all these new things you can do. You learn how to much, to experience

2:02:53.760 --> 2:02:58.400
 life in a much richer way. And so you never run out of ways to go deeper and deeper and

2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:02.160
 deeper in the way you experienced, even just the drinking of the glass of water.

2:03:02.160 --> 2:03:07.200
 That's exactly right. And what becomes kind of exhilarating is you start to be able to predict

2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:11.680
 things that you never, or I don't even have predictions or a word, but I always think of

2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:19.520
 the matrix where I forget who it was, somebody was shooting at Neo and he like leans backwards

2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:25.360
 and he dodges the bullets. In some ways, when you start breaking every little action that

2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:29.360
 your hands do or that your feet do or that your body does down into all these little actions

2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:34.960
 that make up one what we normally think of as an action, all of a sudden you can start to see

2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:40.800
 things almost in slow motion. I like to think of it very much like language. The first time

2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:47.120
 somebody hears a foreign language, it sounds really fast usually. You don't hear the spaces

2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:54.560
 between words. And it just sounds like a stream of consciousness, and it just sounds like a

2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:58.560
 stream of noises if you've never heard the language before. And as you learn the language,

2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:03.760
 you hear clear breaks between words and it starts to gain context and all of a sudden

2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:11.440
 like that, what once sounded very fast slows down and it has meaning. That's our whole life.

2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:17.040
 There's this whole language happening that we don't speak generally. But if you start to speak it

2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:21.920
 and if you start to learn it and you start to say, hey, I'm picking up this glass is actually 18

2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:28.480
 little movements, then all of a sudden it becomes extremely exciting and exhilarating to just

2:04:28.480 --> 2:04:33.200
 just breathe. Breathing alone in the rise and fall of your abdomen or the way the air pushes in

2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:39.840
 and out of your nose becomes almost interesting. And what's really neat is the world just starts

2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:47.040
 slowing down. And I'll never forget that feeling. And if there was one euphoric feeling from meditation

2:04:47.040 --> 2:04:52.000
 I want to gain back, but I don't think I could without really meditating like that again,

2:04:52.000 --> 2:05:00.160
 and I don't think I will. Was this like slow motion of the world? It was finding the spaces

2:05:00.160 --> 2:05:03.520
 between all the movements in the same way that the spaces between all the words happen.

2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:10.480
 And then it almost gives you this new appreciation for everything. It was really amazing. And so I

2:05:10.480 --> 2:05:17.280
 think it came to an abrupt end though when the tsunami hit. I was there in the Indian Ocean tsunami

2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:25.760
 hit in 2004. And it was like this dichotomy of being a monk and just meditating in this extraordinary

2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:32.640
 place. And then the tsunami hits and kills 40,000 people in a few minutes on the coast of this really

2:05:32.640 --> 2:05:41.360
 small little country in Sri Lanka. And then I like my whole world of being a monk came crashing down

2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:54.400
 on when I go to the coast. And I mean, that was just a devastating visual site, an emotional site.

2:05:54.400 --> 2:05:58.640
 But the strangest thing happened, which was that everyone just wanted me to stay as a monk.

2:05:59.600 --> 2:06:06.160
 People in that culture, they wanted to, the monks largely fled from the coastlines.

2:06:06.160 --> 2:06:12.080
 And so then there I was and people wanted me to be a monk. They wanted me to stay on the coast,

2:06:12.080 --> 2:06:19.440
 but be a monk and not help. Not help in the way that I considered helping. They wanted me just

2:06:19.440 --> 2:06:26.640
 to keep meditating so that they could bring me offerings and have their karmic responsibilities

2:06:28.240 --> 2:06:34.880
 attended to as well. And so that was really bizarre to me. It was like, how could I possibly just sit

2:06:34.880 --> 2:06:43.360
 around while all these people, half of everyone's family just died. And so in any case, I stopped

2:06:43.360 --> 2:06:47.440
 being a monk and I moved to this refugee camp and lived there for another six months or so and

2:06:48.720 --> 2:06:57.120
 just stayed there, not as a monk, but tried to raise some money from the U.S. and tried to,

2:06:57.120 --> 2:07:05.680
 like, I didn't know what I was doing. Frankly, I was 22. And I don't think I appreciated at the

2:07:05.680 --> 2:07:13.120
 time how much of a role I was having in that community's life. But it's taken me many years

2:07:13.120 --> 2:07:18.800
 to process all of this since then. But I would say it's what put me into the public health world,

2:07:18.800 --> 2:07:23.920
 seeing it living in that refugee camp and that difference that happened from being a monk to

2:07:23.920 --> 2:07:32.480
 being in this devastating environment just really changed my whole view of what sort of why I was

2:07:32.480 --> 2:07:41.600
 existing, I suppose. Well, so there's this richness of life in a single drink of water

2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:49.120
 that you experience. And then there's this power of nature that's capable to take lives of thousands

2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:57.120
 of people. So given all that, the absurdity of that, let me ask you, and the fact that you study

2:07:57.680 --> 2:08:02.240
 things that could kill the entirety of human civilization, what do you think is the meaning

2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:07.280
 of this all? What do you think is the meaning of life, this whole orchestra with God going on?

2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:16.640
 Does it have a meaning? And maybe from another perspective, how does one live a meaningful

2:08:16.640 --> 2:08:27.600
 life if such as possible? Well, from what I've seen, I don't think there's a single answer to

2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:33.920
 that by any stretch. One of the most interesting things about Buddhism to me is that the human

2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:41.120
 existence is part of suffering, which is very different from Judeo Christian existence, which

2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:52.640
 is that human existence is something very different. There's a richness to it. In Buddhism, it's just

2:08:52.640 --> 2:09:01.440
 another one of your lives. But it's your opportunity to attain nirvana and become a monk, for example,

2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:08.160
 and meditate to attain nirvana. Else, you just go back into the samsara, the cycle of suffering.

2:09:08.160 --> 2:09:20.800
 In some ways, the notion of life and what the purpose of life is, they're completely distinct,

2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:27.600
 this western view of life, which is that this life is the most precious thing in the world,

2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:34.880
 versus this is just another opportunity to try to get out of life. The whole notion of nirvana

2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:42.400
 and in Buddhism, getting out of this sort of cycle of suffering is to vanish. If you could

2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:47.520
 attain nirvana throughout this life, the idea is that you don't get reborn.

2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:57.440
 On the one hand, you have Christian faith and other things that want to go to heaven and live

2:09:57.440 --> 2:10:04.640
 forever in heaven. Then you have this other whole half of humans who want nothing more than to

2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:10.000
 get out of the cycle of rebirth and just not exist anymore. The cycle of suffering.

2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:16.320
 Yeah. How do you reconcile those two? Do you have both of them in you? Do you basically

2:10:16.320 --> 2:10:27.840
 oscillate back and forth? I think we're just a bunch of proteins that we've formed and they work

2:10:27.840 --> 2:10:32.080
 in this really amazing way. They might work in a bigger scale. There might be some

2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:37.120
 connections that we're not really clear about, but they're still biological. I believe that

2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:41.520
 they're biological. How do these proteins become conscious and why do they want to

2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:50.240
 help civilization by having at home rapid tests a scale? Well, I think I don't have an answer to

2:10:50.240 --> 2:11:00.640
 that one, but I really do believe that it's just an evolution of consciousness. I don't personally

2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:07.600
 think my feeling is that we're a bunch of pluses and minuses that have just gotten so complex that

2:11:07.600 --> 2:11:13.520
 they're able to make rich feelings, rich emotions. I do believe though, on the one hand,

2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:19.840
 I sometimes wake up some days, my fiance doesn't always love it, but I think we're all just a

2:11:19.840 --> 2:11:28.000
 bunch of robots with pretty complicated algorithms that we deal with. In that sense,

2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:34.240
 like, okay, if the world just blew up tomorrow and nothing existed the day after that,

2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:40.240
 it's just another blip in the universe. But at the same time, I don't know. So that's

2:11:40.240 --> 2:11:45.920
 kind of probably my most core basic feeling about life. It's like we're just a blip and we may as

2:11:45.920 --> 2:11:52.160
 well make the most of it while we're here blipping. It's one hell of a fine blip though.

2:11:52.160 --> 2:12:00.880
 It is. It's an amazing blink of an eye in time. Michael, you're one of the most

2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:04.640

2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:08.000
 some words from Teddy Roosevelt. It is not the critic who counts. Not the man who points out

2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:14.000
 how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit

2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:20.320
 belongs to the man who actually is in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood,

2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:28.560
 who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again because there is no effort without

2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:35.600
 error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows great enthusiasm,

2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:42.800
 the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end

2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:49.040
 that triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring

2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:57.040
 greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory

2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:14.080
 nor defeat. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
