00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
 The following is a conversation with Carl Hart, Department Chair and Professor of Psychology

00:04.880 --> 00:10.080
 at Columbia University. He's the author of several books on the topic of drugs,

00:10.080 --> 00:16.560
 including his most recent, called Drug Use for Grown Ups, that challenges us to, quote,

00:16.560 --> 00:21.120
 use empirical evidence to guide public policy even if it makes us uncomfortable.

00:21.760 --> 00:27.840
 His research on drugs, including hard drugs like heroin and cocaine, challenges much of what we

00:27.840 --> 00:34.000
 think we know about drugs and their role in society. His main thesis is that drug addiction

00:34.000 --> 00:39.680
 has less to do with the drugs themselves and more to do with cooccurring psychiatric disorders,

00:39.680 --> 00:46.080
 such as depression and schizophrenia, and socioeconomic factors, such as unemployment,

00:46.080 --> 00:51.680
 underemployment, and resource deprivation within the community. In addition, he believes that we

00:51.680 --> 00:57.040
 should legalize all drugs, so that if people choose to use them, they could do so responsibly

00:57.040 --> 01:04.480
 and openly and get help if needed in a controlled, safe environment. His ideas are controversial,

01:04.480 --> 01:10.240
 but are fundamentally grounded in empirical data and rigorous scientific studies. I don't know if

01:10.240 --> 01:16.800
 his conclusions are right, but they are at least worth thinking about. So I ask that you consider

01:16.800 --> 01:22.880
 these ideas with an open mind, and as always, make sure you exercise your critical thinking skills

01:22.880 --> 01:30.400
 in making decisions about substances you put in your body. You are a free thinking being. The main

01:30.400 --> 01:37.120
 character, if you will, the hero in a story that's being written by you. So at the end of the day,

01:37.120 --> 01:44.400
 you are responsible for the choices you make. So choose wisely. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:44.400 --> 01:50.480
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now here's my conversation

01:50.480 --> 01:57.680
 with Carl Hart. I think it is bold and powerful to admit to using in your private life the drugs

01:57.680 --> 02:03.760
 that you study in your research, including heroin and cocaine. So let me ask, what is the experience

02:03.760 --> 02:08.080
 of taking heroin like? What happens to the body? What happens to the mind when you take it?

02:08.720 --> 02:14.240
 Well, you know, I take MDMA, cannabis, and all the rest of these drugs, too. I've tried those

02:14.240 --> 02:21.840
 drugs. The experience in the body and the mind, I don't really know what people want to know in

02:21.840 --> 02:27.680
 that regard. It's like saying, what is the experience of having an orgasm in the body and the mind?

02:27.680 --> 02:34.000
 Or some other sort of event that you really enjoy. So I don't really know what people...

02:34.000 --> 02:37.520
 Is that what poetry is for, for describing these kinds of experiences? I mean, I guess,

02:37.520 --> 02:44.560
 given MDMA, given psilocybin, in the full context of that, maybe it's more useful to say,

02:45.200 --> 02:52.400
 what are the differences in experiences that your mind goes through, like chemically, biologically?

02:53.600 --> 03:00.480
 So it's like keeping it strictly to the sort of the biology of it versus the full environmental

03:00.480 --> 03:05.440
 human experience. Yeah. See, this is a mistake that people make all the time. They try to

03:05.440 --> 03:11.360
 act as if biology is the only determinant of drug effects. And that's just not how it works.

03:12.080 --> 03:17.120
 You need the environment. You need the cage, as they say. If you don't have the cage,

03:17.120 --> 03:23.680
 you don't get the full extent of the effects. And so you can take MDMA and have an awful time.

03:23.680 --> 03:30.480
 You can have a time in which you get paranoid and so forth. And then you can take that drug under

03:30.480 --> 03:35.520
 the right conditions and it just be like one of the best moments you've ever had. It certainly

03:35.520 --> 03:43.040
 enhance a number of my relationships. But I've also had some times with MDMA that haven't been so

03:43.040 --> 03:48.480
 lovely. When the people who you are hanging out with, you don't know them, you're distrustful,

03:48.480 --> 03:54.160
 and all of those kind of things. So it's important to put context in it. Now, we can talk about drugs

03:54.160 --> 03:58.800
 at a biochemical level, at a biological level, and we kind of do that in this country with

03:58.800 --> 04:06.560
 disfascination with neuroscience. And that's an inappropriate kind of fascination in the way

04:06.560 --> 04:12.240
 we talk about it. So we can talk about opioids. And then we can talk about endogenous opioid system

04:12.240 --> 04:18.320
 in the brain. We can talk about dopamine and other sort of monoamine transmitters and what

04:19.040 --> 04:26.560
 opioids are doing to them. And we can do the same thing with MDMA. And we won't be any closer to

04:26.560 --> 04:33.920
 understanding the sort of experience that is induced by these drugs. Certainly the experience

04:33.920 --> 04:38.720
 that we all seek. You know what I'm saying? So getting a positive experience or getting a negative

04:38.720 --> 04:44.640
 experience is strongly defined by the environment. Strongly dependent upon it. But the environment

04:44.640 --> 04:51.280
 is a very, it's a short word that can describe a lot of things. So would you say the environment

04:51.280 --> 04:56.960
 is important? Are the people where you are currently in your life? Or is it also dependent

04:56.960 --> 05:01.440
 on the full trajectory of your psychology, of your life experiences, of your parents, of the

05:01.440 --> 05:06.640
 people you came up with, of the trauma you've experienced, of the hopes and dreams that were

05:06.640 --> 05:13.200
 crushed or not, or the opposite, or the success levels, or all those things? Like what are the

05:13.200 --> 05:19.520
 interesting sort of landscape of experiences that contribute to how you actually feel when

05:19.520 --> 05:24.800
 you take a drug? Right on. So all of those things are important. But you know, like if someone had

05:24.800 --> 05:29.840
 trauma in childhood and they did the work and they dealt with it, that's not so important in this

05:29.840 --> 05:35.680
 case. But if they didn't deal with it and that trauma is being triggered in that event, in that

05:35.680 --> 05:42.720
 moment, then it's important. But let's just take somebody like me. I'm 54 years old. I'll be 55

05:42.720 --> 05:50.080
 this month actually. And you know, I've done a lot of work in terms of figuring out who I am. And

05:50.080 --> 05:59.440
 I'm comfortable with myself. And I know how to set limits for whatever it is I'm doing. And so

06:00.160 --> 06:05.920
 I know I need to work out. I know I need to eat well. I know I need to sleep well. I know I need

06:05.920 --> 06:13.120
 to be in an environment with people within my trust. And then if all of those things are met,

06:13.120 --> 06:19.200
 oh, it's likely to be a good time. You know what I'm saying? But if I haven't slept, if I haven't

06:19.200 --> 06:26.080
 worked out, if I don't feel good, it won't be a good time. But I try and be responsible and take

06:26.080 --> 06:34.160
 care of my eating habits, sleeping habits, make sure my responsibilities are taken care of. And

06:34.160 --> 06:41.920
 so when I'm in that moment, I just enjoy that moment. I'm there. I'm not thinking about a bill

06:41.920 --> 06:47.360
 that I didn't pay. I'm not thinking about, oh, I forgot to do this for my kid. I'm not thinking

06:47.360 --> 06:51.280
 about that because all of those things are taken care of. If they're not taken care of,

06:51.280 --> 06:55.360
 it will impact the experience. And it may negatively impact the experience.

06:57.520 --> 07:02.960
 Well, that is the counterintuitive, even controversial finding from your recent book.

07:02.960 --> 07:08.480
 So we should kind of, I know it seems obvious to you, but I think a lot of people here in this

07:08.480 --> 07:15.760
 will think it's quite non obvious. So in your new book, Drug Use for Grown Ups, you write

07:16.480 --> 07:20.960
 for the findings section. I discovered that the predominant effects produced by the drugs

07:20.960 --> 07:27.200
 discussed in this book are positive. It didn't matter whether the drug in question was cannabis,

07:27.200 --> 07:34.080
 cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, or psilocybin. Overwhelmingly, consumers express feeling more

07:34.080 --> 07:40.720
 altruistic, empathetic, euphoric, focused, grateful, and tranquil. They also experienced enhanced

07:40.720 --> 07:45.200
 social interactions, a great sense of purpose and meaning, and increased sexual intimacy and

07:45.200 --> 07:51.600
 performance. This constellation of findings challenged my original beliefs about drugs and

07:51.600 --> 07:57.360
 their effects. I had been indoctrinated to be biased toward the negative effects of drug use,

07:57.360 --> 08:02.720
 but over the past two plus decades, I had gained a deeper, more nuanced understanding.

08:04.080 --> 08:10.880
 These words are very counterintuitive to a lot of people. I think like you also mentioned in the

08:10.880 --> 08:18.320
 book and elsewhere, you know, people have come around to maybe psilocybin being once such drug,

08:18.320 --> 08:23.360
 maybe cannabis being once such drug, but you also mentioned other drugs like cocaine, heroin,

08:23.360 --> 08:32.400
 methamphetamine. Can you just linger on this point? How do we get the positive effects of

08:32.400 --> 08:37.280
 those drugs and why in the media and the general conception we have of these drugs is that they

08:37.280 --> 08:44.800
 were going to make a bad life worse or ruin a good life? Well, so your first question was,

08:44.800 --> 08:50.640
 how do we harness the positive effects? How do we increase the likelihood of getting the positive

08:50.640 --> 08:56.240
 effects? Again, like I said, we want to make sure that people are responsible and they've handled

08:56.240 --> 09:01.520
 their responsibilities, make sure they eat well, sleep well, exercise, all of those sorts of things

09:01.520 --> 09:06.640
 play an important role. And also, if they know exactly what they're getting, and then they're

09:06.640 --> 09:12.560
 not paranoid about, oh, it's something contaminated in some adulterin, it's in my drug.

09:12.560 --> 09:18.640
 So you want to make sure you know exactly what you have. Once you satisfy those kind of things,

09:18.640 --> 09:23.360
 you understand the dose and potency, you understand all of those things to decrease

09:23.360 --> 09:28.880
 any sort of anxiety you might have about the substance itself, it increases the likelihood

09:28.880 --> 09:33.040
 that you'll have a better time. So anxiety is the big one. You need to remove the anxiety.

09:33.040 --> 09:39.600
 Anxiety is critical. It's huge. Many of the negative effects that we see with drugs have

09:39.600 --> 09:45.680
 to do with anxiety. And not necessarily anxiety because the drug induced it, it's the anxiety

09:45.680 --> 09:52.480
 that the situation induced a lot of times. And then you ask, well, why does this sound counter

09:52.480 --> 10:01.200
 intuitive? Why does the media report differently? Well, because there's money in reporting the

10:01.200 --> 10:09.520
 negative effects almost exclusively. Think about writing a newspaper article. It's really easy to

10:09.520 --> 10:15.360
 get the population all ginned up about something like an opioid crisis, overdoses. And you don't

10:15.360 --> 10:21.360
 even have to tell people how to keep people safe if you're talking about overdose. You don't even

10:21.360 --> 10:27.520
 have to say why people are dying from overdoses. Like overdoses in our country happen largely

10:27.520 --> 10:34.800
 because people get contaminated drug because people are combining sedatives and they don't know that

10:34.800 --> 10:40.560
 this enhances the respiratory depressing effects of drugs. They don't know. But when you read these

10:40.560 --> 10:46.240
 newspaper articles, they don't say this. They don't say how to keep people safe. All they do

10:46.240 --> 10:51.440
 is frighten the population. There's money in that. And then we think about people who write

10:51.440 --> 11:00.160
 TV shows, the people who write movies. Most of the stuff written about drugs is just bullshit.

11:00.160 --> 11:06.160
 I think about, I love going to watch comedians. And the comedians, when they talk about drugs,

11:06.160 --> 11:11.520
 again, most of the things that they say about drugs is bullshit. I mean, you can say the

11:11.520 --> 11:18.800
 stupidest things about drugs and be believed. You can write a movie and you don't even have

11:18.800 --> 11:24.320
 to develop your characters if you throw drugs into the mix. You say, oh, he's a drug dealer.

11:24.320 --> 11:28.720
 You don't have to say anything about that person's background or about that person

11:28.720 --> 11:35.360
 being developed as a character because the population think they know. And the writer

11:36.080 --> 11:41.200
 is lazy and does not do any sort of development. Just think about any...

11:42.640 --> 11:48.560
 Let's think about the Sopranos, for example. They have a new program coming out. So let's

11:48.560 --> 11:55.200
 think about them for a second. The Sopranos is a show in which the lead character, Tony,

11:55.200 --> 12:02.480
 kills people for a living. That's what he does, right? This character actually made

12:03.280 --> 12:11.680
 sympathetic for him when he is besmirching and denigrating his nephew, Christopher,

12:11.680 --> 12:19.120
 for using a drug. And we feel sympathy for Tony, the character who just killed somebody,

12:19.120 --> 12:28.000
 who is a horrible person, but being a drug user is a worse person. That's what the show wants

12:28.000 --> 12:34.240
 us to believe. Tony's a racist murderer, all of these things, but we feel sympathy for him,

12:34.240 --> 12:39.760
 but we don't feel sympathy for anyone who uses drugs. That's some crazy shit. I mean,

12:39.760 --> 12:46.960
 an American public buys into it. That's wild to me and that we all bought into this crap.

12:46.960 --> 12:53.760
 And that's what we do in damnit everything that's in film, on television, and it's like,

12:53.760 --> 13:02.240
 what's wrong with you people? So why aren't there not more stories of grownups using drugs,

13:03.040 --> 13:07.840
 the full spectrum of drugs that we're talking about? Why isn't there... So we talked offline

13:07.840 --> 13:13.440
 about Joe Rogan. He's somebody who started smoking weed later in life, which is an interesting story.

13:13.440 --> 13:18.240
 Like when he's already very successful, and he has a very interesting way of describing his

13:18.240 --> 13:23.600
 experience with weed, that it was like enhancing his productivity. Actually, I think he says it

13:23.600 --> 13:28.800
 increases anxiety a little bit in a way that was productive, like paranoia and not anxiety.

13:29.440 --> 13:35.280
 And so that's an interesting story of an adult talking about the use of weed for productivity

13:35.280 --> 13:42.960
 purposes. But you don't get those stories very often. Why? I think fear. People are afraid that

13:42.960 --> 13:49.600
 they will be belittled, dismissed, all of these things as a drug addict or some negative thing.

13:49.600 --> 13:55.200
 But cannabis is lightweight. Come on. You can admit cannabis these days. And the fact that

13:56.160 --> 14:01.920
 I don't know when Joe started, but if he did start later in life, that's cool. I mean,

14:01.920 --> 14:09.520
 you are mature, developed. You have developed some responsibility skills, all of these kind

14:09.520 --> 14:17.280
 of things. This is a good thing. You don't want people to engage in any kind of behaviors when

14:17.280 --> 14:25.200
 they're young and immature that might put them in harm's way. And so we want people to be developed

14:25.200 --> 14:33.760
 at least. I mean, whether it's being in a relationship with a partner, or whether it's

14:33.760 --> 14:40.800
 driving an automobile, all of these things that can be potentially harmful, but extremely beneficial

14:40.800 --> 14:46.720
 if you are responsible enough to handle them, you want people to be mature. So that's a good thing.

14:46.720 --> 14:51.840
 So how are you supposed to, like somebody like me, somebody like Joe, how are you supposed to

14:51.840 --> 14:56.320
 understand what the dangers are, what the negative effects are? So you said automobile

14:56.320 --> 15:05.760
 relationships. I think I have a reasonably, it's crappy, but reasonable understanding of

15:05.760 --> 15:10.720
 all the troubles I can get with in relationships and what things to avoid. Same thing with driving

15:10.720 --> 15:18.720
 a car. I have no idea. I'm in the dark in terms of what are the things to be careful about,

15:18.720 --> 15:23.120
 what to avoid with drug use when we're talking about the heavy drugs.

15:23.120 --> 15:29.600
 Have you ever drank alcohol? Yes. I'm Russian. I know, I drink a lot. But I understand that

15:29.600 --> 15:35.760
 because culture, I came up, I was taught a lot of like, this is what you don't do,

15:35.760 --> 15:39.840
 and this is what you do. This is when you drink a lot. I mean, you see the effects,

15:39.840 --> 15:44.400
 you see the, there's a lot of negative examples. There's positive examples of social

15:44.400 --> 15:50.720
 stimulant. There's examples of great artists using alcohol to sort of, I don't know,

15:50.720 --> 15:56.800
 to help be the catalyst for that magic moment for, you know, all of that. I don't, I have some

15:56.800 --> 16:03.360
 examples now, especially in America, the same with weed. More and more, you're starting to get a lot

16:03.360 --> 16:12.320
 of stories of psychedelics of different kinds. There's psilocybin where you have mushrooms or

16:12.320 --> 16:20.240
 even MDMA used sort of positively. There's kind of like negative stories in the past about acid,

16:20.240 --> 16:28.320
 about LSD being used, ultimately for productive ends, but it destroyed the person. That's kind

16:28.320 --> 16:34.160
 of how the story goes. It was like a trade off. You take, it's like, what is it? Robert Johnson

16:34.160 --> 16:38.880
 sold his soul to the devil to learn guitar? Like it's a trade off. You could take the drug,

16:38.880 --> 16:42.320
 you're going to create some good stuff, but you have to pay for it. Those are the stories.

16:42.320 --> 16:47.840
 That's some bullshit we tell children. Come on. That's exactly right. You're exactly right. These

16:47.840 --> 16:53.680
 fairy tales, these cautionary tales that we tell people, we have to grow up. That's what the book

16:53.680 --> 17:02.480
 is about, drug use for grownups. You know, we tell people, Pinocchio, if you lie, your nose grow,

17:03.120 --> 17:07.440
 who believes that? Who believes that there are fairy tales, but that's exactly what these stories

17:07.440 --> 17:15.280
 are. They're in the same vein as those kind of stories, as Pinocchio. You know, like you said,

17:15.280 --> 17:21.280
 when you were learning about alcohol, you were told what to do, what not to do, so forth. The

17:21.280 --> 17:28.400
 same can be true with MDMA, with cocaine, with heroin. The same is true, because there are

17:28.400 --> 17:35.040
 some times when you, there are some potential dangers that you should avoid. And I wrote about

17:35.040 --> 17:41.440
 some of them. Certainly in my work, just throughout all of my writings, I talk about those kind of

17:41.440 --> 17:48.160
 things, and other people talk about these things. The problem is, is that we're getting our education

17:48.720 --> 17:55.920
 from bullshit sources, from people who believe in this kind of Pinocchio thing, and it just does

17:55.920 --> 18:02.480
 not fit with the evidence and the evidence we all publish in the scientific literature. All these

18:02.480 --> 18:09.360
 things that I'm saying, it's there in the literature. I mean, a place like Columbia, we give these

18:09.360 --> 18:16.800
 drugs thousands of doses every year. Do you think we would be doing this, and we do this

18:17.520 --> 18:24.560
 with research grants that's funded by the public's taxpayer dollars? Do you think we would be allowed

18:24.560 --> 18:32.160
 to do this if these drugs were so dangerous? It's just nonsense. I mean, and the drugs we're

18:32.160 --> 18:41.600
 talking about, they are all approved for medical use somewhere in the world. And the studies you

18:41.600 --> 18:48.000
 conduct, they're basically asking what kinds of questions. So you take the full range of drugs

18:48.000 --> 18:54.480
 you're talking about, from marijuana, to psilocybin, to MDMA, to cocaine, and heroin. What is the

18:54.480 --> 18:58.160
 study looking at? Like, what the actual experience with the positive and negative effects of the

18:58.160 --> 19:04.400
 experience on the drug are in control conditions? Yeah. So we did these kind of experiments with

19:04.400 --> 19:12.080
 alcohol, nicotine, all these drugs in order to have an empirical database to tell people

19:13.600 --> 19:18.960
 exactly what these drugs do and what they don't do. The conditions under which the drugs will

19:18.960 --> 19:23.680
 produce positive effects, the conditions under which the drugs were more likely to produce

19:23.680 --> 19:30.560
 negative effects, all of this information is important for a society to know. And we do know.

19:30.560 --> 19:37.120
 And that's why we're collecting the data. We're collecting the data to help us with treatment

19:37.120 --> 19:43.680
 if someone is having problems with these data. Hopefully, we'll understand more about

19:45.120 --> 19:50.400
 how to help them deal with their problems based on some of the research that we're doing.

19:50.400 --> 19:54.880
 So what kind of negative effects are we looking out for? Like, what are the properties of drugs

19:54.880 --> 20:01.200
 we should be careful about? Is it addictive properties? How addictive it is? How destructive

20:01.200 --> 20:08.960
 or painful, whatever, the withdrawal processes? What kind of things are we looking out for?

20:08.960 --> 20:13.280
 Yeah, those are certain kind of questions we certainly have asked because like something

20:13.280 --> 20:21.360
 like right cocaine versus alcohol or heroin when it comes to withdrawal of physical dependence,

20:21.360 --> 20:26.880
 like cocaine has a very limited sort of withdrawal symptoms. I mean, it's hard to see

20:27.600 --> 20:32.400
 same as true with methamphetamine. But with heroin, you certainly can see a withdrawal

20:32.400 --> 20:39.840
 syndrome that's unpleasant. But with alcohol, that withdrawal can actually kill you. So heroin

20:39.840 --> 20:45.600
 is unpleasant and not lovely. But with alcohol withdrawal, that's the one that's the most dangerous.

20:45.600 --> 20:53.120
 I mean, all of these kind of questions we want to know answers to. And so when we think about

20:54.000 --> 20:58.480
 heroin or some other drugs, and you say like what kind of negative effects, negative effects,

20:58.480 --> 21:03.120
 we don't talk about much in the society. The main thing that really concerns me about like

21:03.120 --> 21:11.120
 heroin use really, is constipation. So if people are using heroin on a regular basis,

21:11.120 --> 21:19.200
 and then they have a sort of slowing of their gut modality, they're likely to increase constipation.

21:19.200 --> 21:24.960
 And that's not good. I mean, for your general health, but we never talk about that in this

21:24.960 --> 21:31.120
 society. And that's probably the most important thing, aside from the fact that people get

21:31.120 --> 21:35.680
 contaminated with street drugs and that sort of stuff and increase the likelihood of maybe dying

21:35.680 --> 21:42.480
 from some contaminant or people who are inexperienced and they're mixing heroin with other sedatives,

21:42.480 --> 21:50.160
 that's not good. But the constipation is a huge one. And then other sort of drugs, negative

21:50.160 --> 21:56.800
 effects, like the amphetamines, all of the amphetamines, they disrupt sleep, food intake,

21:56.800 --> 22:02.880
 all of these things are so critical for sustaining human life. But we never talk about that,

22:02.880 --> 22:07.920
 because it's not as sexy as this nonsense that people write about, like addiction.

22:07.920 --> 22:13.040
 Addiction has almost nothing to do with the drugs themselves. And I make that comment because

22:14.080 --> 22:21.120
 the vast majority of users for any drug never become addicted. And so if the vast majority

22:21.120 --> 22:26.080
 of users don't become addicted, then you have to move beyond the drug when you're talking about

22:26.080 --> 22:31.440
 the phenomenon of interest. In this case, addiction. And so when we think about addiction,

22:31.440 --> 22:37.200
 it has much more to do with our psychosocial environment than the drug itself. But that's

22:37.200 --> 22:43.440
 not sexy. So addiction is even the property of the environment, not a property, a result of the

22:43.440 --> 22:50.720
 environment. It certainly can be. There are people who are suffering from cooccurring mental illness

22:50.720 --> 22:56.640
 like depression, anxiety. I mean, that's within the person, of course. And that increases the

22:56.640 --> 23:03.120
 likelihood for addiction. So that's not so much the environment. But there are people who, for

23:03.120 --> 23:09.680
 example, they have chronic unrealistic expectations heaped on them. And those people are more likely

23:09.680 --> 23:15.680
 to have some problems with drug. There are people who are just immature, not developed,

23:15.680 --> 23:22.240
 haven't developed responsibility skills. They are likely to have some problems if they engage in

23:22.240 --> 23:28.160
 some of these behaviors. There are people who lost their jobs, COVID, factories went away,

23:28.160 --> 23:34.160
 a wide range of things. And those people used to have standing in their community. Now they have

23:34.160 --> 23:40.560
 none. Those people might be susceptible to having a drug related problem if they indulge.

23:40.560 --> 23:45.280
 Which all of these kind of issues are far more important than the drug itself.

23:46.240 --> 23:51.520
 And so they could seek escape in a particular drug. I mean, there is a biochemical thing to each

23:51.520 --> 23:57.120
 of these drugs. And some pull you in harder than others when you need to escape, right? When you're

23:57.120 --> 24:02.400
 not doing well in life. What evidence you have for that? I don't. Because there is none. There is

24:02.400 --> 24:10.400
 absolutely none. I mean, people say stuff like that. And that's the problem. That's precisely

24:10.400 --> 24:16.000
 the problem. See, I'm operating from limited personal evidence. Well, this is a problem though,

24:16.000 --> 24:22.720
 but we have a scientific database. We don't need personal evidence for this. In my book,

24:22.720 --> 24:26.720
 I try to go through some of the science so people could understand. It's like,

24:27.920 --> 24:32.640
 when you have a math problem, you don't want people saying, well, you know, I feel like this.

24:32.640 --> 24:39.120
 Fuck what you feel. What does the data say? So one of the problems with the data. So one data is

24:39.120 --> 24:44.000
 the, there's the studies that you're doing. This is excellent research work, but there's some of

24:44.000 --> 24:51.600
 the drugs that are illegal. Yes. And some are legal. So you have just, it's unfortunate that

24:51.600 --> 24:57.120
 some of the drugs are illegal or whatever you believe, but there's not enough of a data set of

24:57.120 --> 25:02.880
 public and the open use that's like you have in the wild data set. It'd be nice to do, you know,

25:02.880 --> 25:07.280
 thousands of people and see from all the different kinds of environments and all that kind of stuff

25:07.280 --> 25:13.840
 to get an understanding. I think we have a substantial, a substantial database, but people

25:13.840 --> 25:23.360
 just ignore it. Got it. That said, let me ask you the question of legalization. So should,

25:23.360 --> 25:28.480
 in your view, all drugs be legalized? The drugs that people seek certainly should

25:28.480 --> 25:35.280
 be legally regulated and available to adults. So when I say the drugs people seek like cannabis,

25:35.280 --> 25:43.840
 MDMA, cocaine, heroin, those drugs certainly should be available. And some of the psychedelics

25:43.840 --> 25:51.680
 that people seek. Now, the thing about it is that some people think that, oh, it will be a

25:51.680 --> 25:56.320
 free fall. These drugs are available to everyone. That's not true. I mean, it will be, there will

25:56.320 --> 26:03.040
 be age requirements and maybe other requirements, but they should be available. And we should also

26:03.040 --> 26:09.440
 do like what we do with alcohol. We can put enough alcohol in a bottle to kill you, but we don't.

26:09.440 --> 26:16.640
 So we regulate it such that the amount that's in the bottle enhances the safety and minimizes the

26:16.640 --> 26:22.960
 potential harms. We can do the same thing with these other drugs. And we can also say, okay,

26:22.960 --> 26:30.480
 we won't be selling intravenous preparations of any of these drugs. The drugs that the routes

26:30.480 --> 26:39.760
 of administration will be oral. And I don't know, let's say intranasal. Again, routes of

26:39.760 --> 26:48.640
 administration, the dose that you have in each unit all can minimize harm based on how you do

26:48.640 --> 26:51.840
 these things. And we can do that. We have the technology we have to know how.

26:53.840 --> 26:58.240
 You're actually making me think about alcohol a little bit. So if I were, say, the drugs become

26:58.240 --> 27:05.280
 legalized in the way you're describing. And me, Lex, wanted to, as an adult, explore some of these

27:05.280 --> 27:13.840
 drugs. What are some procedures, do you think, for sort of safe positive exploration of those

27:13.840 --> 27:20.080
 drugs? The reason I say I'm thinking about alcohol, because I don't think besides not putting enough

27:20.080 --> 27:26.000
 alcohol in a bottle to kill you, I don't think anyone ever gave me specific instructions. I think

27:26.000 --> 27:31.760
 it's kind of word of mouth and examples of people doing the wrong thing. You kind of get it through

27:31.760 --> 27:38.160
 osmosis that way. Is that basically what we would do, this kind of free exploration of use?

27:38.160 --> 27:43.600
 No, we have to change our education about these things. I mean, let's just take a drug like

27:43.600 --> 27:48.240
 cocaine. Cocaine is a stimulant. And you want to make sure people understand that they shouldn't

27:48.240 --> 27:54.000
 be taking cocaine here at bedtime. And you know, they need to get a certain amount of hours of

27:54.000 --> 27:59.920
 sleep. And they need to get up in the morning. Cocaine probably isn't a drug for you at night,

27:59.920 --> 28:05.840
 certainly not. Certainly not amphetamines at night, for most people. And also, if you want to make

28:05.840 --> 28:11.680
 sure that you, they need to understand that cocaine can also disrupt your food intake,

28:11.680 --> 28:16.240
 not as much as the amphetamines, but all of these kind of things people need to know so they can

28:16.240 --> 28:25.360
 have proper nutrition and they can time their drug use around these other important functions

28:25.360 --> 28:33.280
 that's the same human life. So we have to make sure that we educate people. We can't just throw

28:33.280 --> 28:39.120
 people in a while. That's stupid. I gotta tell you, I mean, for me, even giving your book and

28:39.120 --> 28:45.120
 for people listening to this, it's still tough to hear that the thing we should be concerned about

28:45.120 --> 28:52.800
 with cocaine is the same as with caffeine. Don't take it before bed. And the thing we should be

28:52.800 --> 29:03.680
 concerned with heroin is constipation. Yeah. Okay. But the questions I keep wanting to ask you,

29:04.640 --> 29:10.560
 I should be asking the same things of alcohol. But when you're not doing well psychologically,

29:10.560 --> 29:18.640
 in the ways you described, when the environment is not right, there's some aspect in which saying

29:18.640 --> 29:23.600
 that drugs can be used responsibly and effectively and mostly positive,

29:25.040 --> 29:31.120
 can give those folks a pass to use it instead of working on themselves and fixing their

29:31.120 --> 29:37.120
 environment first. What do you want me to say to that? I mean, they have access to alcohol,

29:37.120 --> 29:43.120
 they have access to it. Yeah. You know, we live in this country called the United States where

29:43.120 --> 29:49.040
 our Declaration of Independence says that we are free to live like we want to live so long as we

29:49.040 --> 29:56.400
 don't disrupt other people from doing the same. But it's remarkable to me how we try to control

29:56.400 --> 30:02.960
 the behaviors of other people. That's just remarkable. Yeah. And that's partially what your

30:02.960 --> 30:08.000
 book is about. I mean, it's not just about drugs, it's about freedom. That's the bigger issue that

30:08.000 --> 30:14.560
 we can't get to. It's like this issue of freedom. And freedom comes with a tremendous amount of

30:14.560 --> 30:22.800
 responsibility. I am responsible for my neighbors, my brothers. I mean, I can't impede their freedoms.

30:22.800 --> 30:28.080
 Like some people think that their freedom supersedes everybody else's freedoms. No. And that's what

30:28.080 --> 30:38.000
 I'm trying to remind people in this book. I am responsible to you as a citizen. And we're in

30:38.000 --> 30:45.440
 this together. And I tried to make that point in the book and people have conveniently ignored

30:45.440 --> 30:52.160
 things like that. Do you think the war on drugs has done more positive or negative for the world?

30:52.160 --> 30:58.160
 It depends on which world you live in. The war on drugs has been hugely beneficial

30:58.720 --> 31:07.440
 to law enforcement, to the media, to people who make bullshit TV shows, the Sopranos,

31:07.440 --> 31:17.040
 the wire, all of those shows, they benefit from this kind of nonsense. Who else have benefited?

31:17.040 --> 31:22.960
 People who provide treatment, many of them benefit from the war on drugs. The folks who do

31:23.600 --> 31:30.400
 urine testing for drugs, they've all benefited them making mad money. People who run prisons,

31:31.120 --> 31:37.760
 the phone companies, who charge the prisoners, the people who run the hotels that are around

31:37.760 --> 31:43.840
 the prisons, where people's family have to come and stay, the restaurants, they are making out

31:43.840 --> 31:51.360
 like bandits. But many of us are getting screwed. As a society, in general, we're getting screwed.

31:51.360 --> 31:57.040
 But there are people who are just benefiting handsomely. That's why it continues. Politicians

31:57.040 --> 32:02.080
 benefit. I mean, whether you're Democrat or Republican, you have the same stance on drugs

32:02.080 --> 32:08.160
 anyway, so they all benefit from this. So many questions I want to ask you because you're challenging

32:08.160 --> 32:14.240
 a lot of beliefs that people have about drugs, about society in general. So it's difficult for me

32:14.240 --> 32:23.680
 to ask the right questions here. But if you could, if you were with a sort of a snap of a finger,

32:23.680 --> 32:31.280
 change the world, what from a policy perspective would you, and from just a, I don't know,

32:32.240 --> 32:36.240
 human to human perspective, what would you like to see in the United States of America?

32:36.240 --> 32:39.680
 In terms of that fix, is some of the problems we're discussing here?

32:39.680 --> 32:44.720
 First of all, we wouldn't be arresting anybody for drugs anymore. That would go away.

32:45.680 --> 32:50.800
 The folks who are in prison for drugs, that would go away. Their records would be expunged.

32:50.800 --> 32:59.520
 That would just go away. And then we work on a system to make sure that responsible adults can

32:59.520 --> 33:05.680
 legally obtain these substances. And we will have a corresponding educational system to

33:05.680 --> 33:10.800
 teach people how to do this. That's where I would start initially.

33:12.240 --> 33:19.520
 Yeah, the arresting for drug use or anything drug related is absurd, especially in the context

33:19.520 --> 33:24.880
 of how destructive alcohol is, and tobacco. Alcohol can be destructive to some people,

33:24.880 --> 33:30.240
 but alcohol also is a hugely beneficial drug, to be honest, which I couldn't have gotten through

33:30.240 --> 33:36.880
 many of the sort of receptions and functions I had to go through as the chair of the department

33:36.880 --> 33:43.040
 without alcohol. Yeah, you have a line I really liked. The vast amount of predictably favorable

33:43.040 --> 33:48.400
 drug effects intrigued me, so much so that I expanded my own drug use to take advantage

33:48.400 --> 33:53.600
 of the wide array of beneficial alcohol specific drugs can offer. The part that entertained me

33:53.600 --> 34:00.480
 was this. To put this in personal terms, my position as department chairman from 2016 to 2019

34:00.480 --> 34:06.320
 was far more detrimental to my health than my drug use ever was. I mean, there is a standard

34:06.320 --> 34:10.480
 we're treating drugs, certain kinds of drugs that's completely different than the standard

34:10.480 --> 34:16.960
 we're treating everything else in our lives. Yeah, I mean, it's almost difficult to snap out of it

34:16.960 --> 34:26.400
 as I'm listening to you and reading your work. It's difficult because it's like,

34:27.040 --> 34:34.400
 why is everybody living this idea that certain drugs are so horribly destructive and others are

34:34.400 --> 34:42.160
 not? And we just kind of fix that idea. And then there's this narrative. I hate to be so cynical

34:42.160 --> 34:47.280
 to think that there is just like a system that just propagates narratives. I always kind of think

34:47.280 --> 34:53.920
 that truth wins out. Truth is the best narrative. I believe that too. Obviously, that's why I'm out

34:53.920 --> 34:59.280
 here and putting, subjecting myself to this sort of criticism and so forth. But because I believe

34:59.280 --> 35:07.760
 that truth ultimately wins out, but I might be wrong. But I have to live my life like it's true.

35:07.760 --> 35:13.200
 Otherwise, then I have no hope. Then why be here? Well, kind of if you can steal man or at least

35:13.200 --> 35:21.200
 show respect to a criticism, I'm sure received quite a bit of criticism for your work. I've

35:21.200 --> 35:27.200
 heard quite a bit of BS criticism, sort of ignorant stuff that don't actually pay attention to your

35:27.200 --> 35:33.440
 work. But is there some serious, like, is there some pushback that makes you think twice?

35:33.440 --> 35:41.360
 People say, like, I'm presenting a too rosy picture of drugs. I don't want to do that.

35:41.360 --> 35:48.560
 I don't want people to think that I'm not aware of the potential negative effects of any activity,

35:48.560 --> 35:56.800
 including drug use. And so I do acknowledge that there are potential harms associated with drugs.

35:56.800 --> 36:02.560
 I acknowledge that in the book. But the fact remains, the beneficial effects far outweigh

36:02.560 --> 36:09.760
 the potential harmful effects. And we have technology information to help people to minimize

36:09.760 --> 36:15.920
 the likelihood of those negative effects. But this sort of approach that we have where we say

36:15.920 --> 36:22.160
 we're only exclusively presenting the harmful effects, and that should make people keep people

36:22.160 --> 36:30.400
 safe. I just have a problem with that. But I certainly, I take the point that people say

36:30.400 --> 36:34.160
 some people say there are negative effects. Absolutely. I absolutely agree.

36:34.960 --> 36:41.520
 What do you, if I can just talk about specific drugs, what's the difference between opioids

36:41.520 --> 36:50.800
 and benzos, for example? Specifically, I mean, these are drugs that you often read about being

36:50.800 --> 36:57.200
 misused at scale. I mean, the misuse is the problem, right? No matter what the drug is.

36:57.200 --> 37:01.760
 Yes. And that's actually what you're pushing for is education. And it should be, it should be

37:01.760 --> 37:07.600
 legal and should be good. So people should know what's the difference in proper use,

37:08.480 --> 37:14.560
 positive use and misuse. I mean, one public figure who has been going through this is Jordan

37:14.560 --> 37:19.680
 Peterson. He's been public about his struggle of getting off benzos, the withdrawal he's going

37:19.680 --> 37:27.120
 through. I mean, what are your thoughts about the misuse of benzos or opioids and so on,

37:27.120 --> 37:33.120
 the epidemic that people talk about? Yeah. I don't know Jordan's specific case,

37:33.120 --> 37:38.080
 but certainly with benzodiazepines in general, we talked about withdrawal earlier. When I said

37:38.080 --> 37:43.360
 that with alcohol, withdrawal, you can die. So benzos and alcohol, they're closely related.

37:43.360 --> 37:49.680
 So benzo withdrawal too can kill you, just like alcohol. So when we think about the effects that

37:49.680 --> 37:55.600
 benzodiazepines produce, think about the effects that alcohol produce. They're comparable or similar.

37:55.600 --> 38:03.520
 And so I know that it's a difficult one to wean yourself off if you develop the dependence, but

38:04.560 --> 38:08.560
 we have protocols for that. And I hope he's okay.

38:08.560 --> 38:12.720
 Since she said we have protocols for that, but for my understanding was that

38:13.520 --> 38:19.360
 the protocols aren't standardized. It feels like a lot of doctors aren't as helpful as they could

38:19.360 --> 38:26.480
 be in this process. It's a bit of a mess. Certainly with withdrawal, they're more standardized than

38:26.480 --> 38:32.400
 anything. So if someone is going through alcohol withdrawal, there is a standard protocol that

38:32.400 --> 38:39.680
 most physicians in this business, they follow. The same is true with benzo withdrawal. But the

38:39.680 --> 38:45.360
 thing where it gets murky is when they're treating addiction itself. So when you're thinking about

38:46.080 --> 38:51.280
 the substance use disorder in the DSM, not just withdrawal, but the entire addiction,

38:51.280 --> 39:01.120
 that's where you have this sort of divergence or diversity in terms of approaches. And many of

39:01.120 --> 39:07.760
 those approaches are rubbish. Can you just elaborate technically what the term addiction

39:07.760 --> 39:13.360
 means that you're referring to? When I use the term addiction, I'm referring to the

39:13.360 --> 39:19.920
 diagnostic statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association, number five now,

39:19.920 --> 39:28.000
 the DSM five. That's never been wrong, right? I'm just kidding. That point is well taken.

39:28.000 --> 39:35.200
 And your point is that their definition of substance use disorder, that's addiction,

39:35.200 --> 39:41.760
 that's what I'm talking about. But that definition continues to evolve. And so you're right. They

39:41.760 --> 39:47.440
 still are working it out. We're getting new information from scientific studies and so

39:47.440 --> 39:53.200
 forth. And so it's supposed to be incorporated into the DSM. But there are some problems with

39:53.200 --> 40:00.400
 the DSM, like for example, they also have this sort of once an addict, always an addict thing.

40:00.400 --> 40:06.560
 And there's no evidence to support that. But it's evolving. And it's the definition

40:07.520 --> 40:13.680
 that people in science and medicine use. And so we all know we're talking about the same language

40:13.680 --> 40:19.600
 when we call someone a substance use disorder patient or someone who meets criteria for addiction.

40:19.600 --> 40:24.720
 We all are speaking the same language. We're not saying that simply because this person

40:24.720 --> 40:29.840
 use heroin, they are an addict. That's not what we're saying. You have to meet these criteria

40:29.840 --> 40:38.160
 where you have disruptions in your psychosocial functioning. That's one. And two, you, the person

40:38.160 --> 40:46.480
 are distressed by this, these, these disruptions. So people have to meet those two basic criteria

40:46.480 --> 40:54.240
 before we say they are addicted. So once an addict, always an addict, this idea. So I've,

40:56.320 --> 41:01.680
 I mean, some of it is always mapped to the person, right? But just the people I've interacted with

41:01.680 --> 41:06.800
 who have struggled with alcohol addiction, I don't know what the proper term is. It seems

41:06.800 --> 41:15.520
 like with alcohol anonymous, the process of putting that addiction behind you is a very,

41:15.520 --> 41:20.560
 very long process. It's surprisingly long to me. That almost seems like a whole life.

41:20.560 --> 41:27.760
 Like it's not always an addict, but it takes decades. It seems like, what is that? What,

41:28.560 --> 41:33.200
 can you maybe just, from your understanding as a scientist, from your understanding as a human

41:33.200 --> 41:40.720
 who studies human nature, why does it take so long to treat, to, to, to, to deal with that

41:40.720 --> 41:49.840
 addiction? Well, you cited alcohol anonymous, right? And so I don't think of alcohol anonymous as

41:49.840 --> 41:57.280
 like a treatment that I would send any relative to, you know, like for a drug related problem.

41:57.280 --> 42:04.160
 You know, I think alcohol anonymous AA is really good for social interactions,

42:04.160 --> 42:11.360
 making sure people have a social group and they have peers. I mean, that's a good thing. We all

42:11.360 --> 42:16.960
 need that social interaction. But I don't think they know much about drugs. That's not, that's,

42:16.960 --> 42:24.480
 it's like saying, well, you know, my uncle broke his knee and he, he has this support group and

42:24.480 --> 42:32.240
 they said this. And then we follow that. That doesn't make any sense. But in our society,

42:32.240 --> 42:42.880
 judges even sentence people to go to AA. Are you kidding me? But, but that's the kind of thing that

42:42.880 --> 42:51.040
 has been allowed to happen in this society because we think of drugs as this moral failing or drug,

42:51.040 --> 42:57.920
 drug addiction as this moral failing. And any idiot can provide treatment and no disrespect

42:57.920 --> 43:04.000
 to AA because I think what they do is a lot more than what some people do because at least they

43:04.000 --> 43:11.040
 have this social, these social interactions, you have a social group. That's better than what

43:11.040 --> 43:18.240
 a lot of these other idiots out here do. Well, in that social support group, unrelated to the drug,

43:18.240 --> 43:23.360
 it helps cure some of the environment issues you might be in. That's the whole point. So we kind

43:23.360 --> 43:29.120
 of coupled the drug to the environment. But the reality is, as, as you argue, most of the problems

43:29.120 --> 43:33.840
 come from the environment. Certainly with people who are experiencing drug related problem with

43:33.840 --> 43:41.680
 most of the people, not all, but most. There are differences like that psychedelics and like

43:41.680 --> 43:49.280
 psilocybin has versus alcohol. I personally think, you know, I've enjoyed both experiences in

43:49.280 --> 43:56.000
 different ways. Is it possible or is this, are we getting into the realm of poetry to describe

43:56.000 --> 44:01.680
 the benefits, like how it alters the, how the different drugs alter the mind

44:02.880 --> 44:06.720
 and the places it can take you that produce a positive experience?

44:06.720 --> 44:14.400
 Yeah. No, it's very real, you know, like some drugs take people in places that other drugs

44:14.400 --> 44:21.680
 can. And that's, that's very real. I have friends, some of them you know, they,

44:23.360 --> 44:29.680
 they, for example, say that they've never had an experience like the one they had with Ayahuasca.

44:29.680 --> 44:36.320
 And they've done a number of sort of things. But they did the Ayahuasca in a setting with

44:36.320 --> 44:47.680
 a shaman and this group. And they felt like they actually began to heal or solve some problems that

44:47.680 --> 44:52.960
 they were trying to solve for some years. And that's, that's great. That's great for them.

44:53.840 --> 44:58.720
 And nothing else does it for them like that. And that's absolutely fantastic.

44:58.720 --> 45:09.520
 All I argue is that if that kind of thing happens for you with Ayahuasca, with psilocybin,

45:09.520 --> 45:16.880
 with some other psychedelic, why isn't it possible that heroin does that for someone,

45:16.880 --> 45:23.200
 or cocaine does that for someone else, or MDMA does it for someone? That's it.

45:23.200 --> 45:29.680
 That's interesting to imagine like a shaman for heroin, like why not? And or cocaine,

45:29.680 --> 45:34.240
 you said creating an environment for yourself for use of these different substances. And that

45:34.240 --> 45:42.640
 environment has a, has a very strong impact on the actual experience that you have. But I mean,

45:42.640 --> 45:50.880
 so cocaine is an upper and then. Yeah, the way we defend drugs like uppers and downers,

45:50.880 --> 45:58.720
 that's a, that's a really kind of inappropriate way, but it's a quick way. So we certainly say

45:58.720 --> 46:05.520
 cocaine is an upper or stimulant, but you know, it depends on the activity of the person before

46:05.520 --> 46:10.640
 they take the drug. Say like if you're like really active before taking a drug like cocaine,

46:10.640 --> 46:16.160
 it might actually calm you. So it all depends on the activity of the person before they take

46:16.160 --> 46:22.080
 the drug. I remember, I don't know if you know Matthew Johnson is. Of course. He did all these

46:22.080 --> 46:26.960
 studies on, or I remember just reading a paper. I didn't get a chance to talk with him much about

46:26.960 --> 46:33.600
 it, but it was about condom use and cocaine. And then, you know, what, like the doses and whether

46:33.600 --> 46:41.200
 people are more or less likely, like the unsafe thing there is the using or not using or not using,

46:41.200 --> 46:48.400
 I guess condoms during sexual intercourse. I don't know. I just, I love that these drugs that have

46:49.360 --> 46:53.680
 connotation probably because of Hollywood negative connotations are actually being

46:53.680 --> 46:58.080
 studied by science and then the actual impact they have and what are the negative effects.

46:58.080 --> 47:05.120
 Again, in those studies, often the positive effects are difficult to quantify. I think

47:05.120 --> 47:09.680
 maybe I guess you can from self report and so on. The positive effects are not difficult to

47:09.680 --> 47:18.080
 quantify. You ask people about their euphoria. You can see how well people are getting along.

47:18.080 --> 47:24.560
 Like in our studies that we have people sometimes in groups and you see how well they get along

47:25.600 --> 47:32.240
 on the various drug conditions or placebo conditions. It's really, it's not that difficult.

47:32.240 --> 47:38.240
 And then you can see these amazing studies with like Rick Doblin, like looking at MDMA and

47:38.240 --> 47:46.400
 combined with therapy, like how you can overcome certain PTSD things or depression and so on.

47:46.960 --> 47:52.000
 Yeah, it's really interesting. It's, it's really interesting. I gotta ask you because you mentioned

47:52.000 --> 47:57.280
 the wire. Do you think the wire, you think movies like Transpotting, do you think they're ultimately

47:57.280 --> 48:03.360
 destroyed? Because, okay, yes, they celebrate murder, right? The Godfather a little bit.

48:03.360 --> 48:12.080
 Yeah. But another one, I mean, it's like these racist ass motherfuckers. And they also are killing

48:12.080 --> 48:17.360
 people. But yet they say, we don't do drugs. What kind of shit is that? I mean, people who are doing

48:17.360 --> 48:25.600
 drugs, psilocybin or whatever. The thing is, we're trying to be better people and trying to make

48:25.600 --> 48:32.160
 our society better. And you're killing people and you are denigrating people for using drugs.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.840
 Are you fucking kidding me? And we let them get away with that as a society.

48:35.840 --> 48:40.160
 Do you see those movies? I apologize if I'm not sufficiently informed. Do you see them as

48:40.160 --> 48:46.240
 denigrating drugs? Of course. I mean, Godfather. Yes, that's right. That's a good example.

48:46.240 --> 48:53.040
 The Godfather, the Sopranos is all about that. I mean, Christopher is using heroin in the Sopranos

48:53.040 --> 49:03.440
 and they have an intervention in one season and they are denigrating him. Are you kidding me?

49:03.440 --> 49:09.680
 You just cut somebody's head off. Yeah. But to be fair, they were denigrating, I think, all drugs.

49:10.320 --> 49:13.360
 And then they're drinking alcohol in the butterbeam. Yeah, yeah.

49:15.440 --> 49:19.360
 First of all, they're killing people. Yeah. They don't have any space,

49:19.360 --> 49:27.520
 none, to denigrate somebody who's just trying to alter their consciousness. Are you kidding me?

49:27.520 --> 49:33.600
 And not bothering anyone else. But there's a lot of other mob movies that Scarface celebrates

49:33.600 --> 49:41.200
 the murder and the drugs equally. So I mean, it doesn't, it celebrates all of the,

49:41.760 --> 49:48.640
 just not just drugs or so on. It's all those movies. I loved all those movies. I'm from Miami.

49:48.640 --> 49:53.440
 I loved Scarface. I even liked the Sopranos that I started looking at that shit with a critical

49:53.440 --> 50:03.280
 eye and see what it's doing. But Scarface is dependent upon the American viewer having a

50:03.280 --> 50:09.680
 certain view of people who deal in drugs. And that view is that these people are animals,

50:09.680 --> 50:16.720
 basically. And in the end, the animal kills himself with too much cocaine and he was high.

50:16.720 --> 50:22.560
 That's what they show. And so it's like, what the fuck? So it's leveraging as playing into

50:24.000 --> 50:34.000
 not the better angels of our nature. The question. Don't take away these great movies for me.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.440
 But it's true. You have to think about them critically in the content. Wait, wait, wait,

50:37.440 --> 50:42.960
 wait, wait, wait. I like these movies. It's not a matter of taking away. It's a matter of making

50:42.960 --> 50:49.360
 the writers be more honest to the reality. That's it. That's true. That's really true.

50:49.360 --> 50:54.720
 And the writers, the people, the culture, all of it. I mean, they write these things. I just

50:54.720 --> 51:00.640
 think about some hip hop artists. They say, like, this is real. This is my experience and so for

51:00.640 --> 51:05.920
 it. And that's how these movie writers, they write this bullshit and then say, well, this is real.

51:05.920 --> 51:13.120
 So anyway, I get so upset talking about it because I know the harm it's doing.

51:13.120 --> 51:17.840
 And I know those kind of movies are the reason that we have this war on drugs.

51:18.800 --> 51:22.960
 And all of these people are going to jail because of those kind of movies.

51:24.560 --> 51:30.160
 In the epilogue of your book, you quote James Baldwin, you cannot know what you will discover

51:30.160 --> 51:36.480
 on the journey, what you will do with, what you find or what you find will do to you.

51:36.480 --> 51:42.160
 So let me ask, how has drug use or the study of drugs changed you as a human being?

51:42.880 --> 51:49.360
 It just helped me think about other people's experience, right? So how we're all connected,

51:49.360 --> 51:53.680
 like going to Northern Ireland. I don't know if you know much about the situation with the

51:53.680 --> 52:00.560
 troubles and what those people went through. And so I see people there, Northern Ireland,

52:00.560 --> 52:07.120
 by the way, is all white. And you see those people there suffering for the same reasons that people

52:07.120 --> 52:14.560
 in Appalachian are suffering for, neglected by politicians who told them lies about drugs

52:14.560 --> 52:20.320
 and not dealing with the real problems like West Virginia, for example, their waters polluted,

52:20.320 --> 52:26.800
 the factories have gone away, people are desperate, and they're blaming drugs. Are you kidding me?

52:27.520 --> 52:34.480
 So the politicians don't have to bring back the jobs. So we don't have to really make sure they

52:34.480 --> 52:39.760
 have clean drinking water, things of that nature. And so those people are connected to the people

52:39.760 --> 52:44.640
 in Northern Ireland. They're connected to the people in Brownsville. They're connected to the

52:44.640 --> 52:50.240
 people in other places in the United States for the same reason. They're connected to the people

52:50.240 --> 52:59.520
 in São Paulo, Brazil. Same thing, people are catching hell for the same reason in the Philippines

52:59.520 --> 53:05.600
 for the same reason. And that's why I feel so strongly about this thing, because I know

53:06.480 --> 53:13.920
 there are people getting paid and their paycheck is predicated on subjugating and the suffering

53:13.920 --> 53:22.720
 of those other people. So when we hear about the destructive effects of drugs, it's essentially

53:24.320 --> 53:30.800
 a scapegoat for the failures of leaders and politicians to help alleviate the suffering

53:30.800 --> 53:36.080
 of people in those communities. Absolutely. It's so easy to say, I'm going to rid your community

53:36.080 --> 53:43.920
 of drugs. I'm going to put more cops on the street. If you want a problem, not to be solved,

53:44.880 --> 53:50.560
 just give it to the military or the cops. You had a tough childhood growing up in Miami, like you

53:50.560 --> 53:58.560
 said. What memories, memory stands out in particular that was formative and helping make you the man

53:58.560 --> 54:10.880
 you are. That's so hard to say. My grandmother was really important. So maybe just her trying to

54:10.880 --> 54:16.400
 make sure that I think critically. I guess that's the biggest one. So you moved in with

54:16.400 --> 54:22.960
 her, your parents split? Six, seven, yeah. What have you learned about life from her?

54:22.960 --> 54:29.680
 Be self sufficient, be critical, and keep your eyes open and watch out for the okey

54:29.680 --> 54:38.400
 dope. That's what this whole drug thing is about. It's the okey dope. It really boils down to

54:39.040 --> 54:44.720
 just simple thing. We're all similar in that we're all just trying to live our life,

54:44.720 --> 54:50.240
 trying to take care of our kids. We want the best for our kids, all of us. But yet, somehow,

54:50.240 --> 54:58.560
 we've been made to believe that we're different in that way, but fundamentally, we're all the same.

54:58.560 --> 55:06.800
 So when people are seeking to feel pleasure, to feel better, why don't we celebrate that?

55:06.800 --> 55:15.040
 Instead, we denigrate people for that. I mean, if I feel better, I'm more likely to treat you well.

55:15.040 --> 55:23.360
 I got to say still, though, you're going against the grain and you're at Columbia.

55:25.760 --> 55:33.280
 It takes a lot of guts to speak out about these ideas so boldly. I don't know how to ask this

55:33.280 --> 55:40.800
 question. Where do you find the guts? Because it's also perhaps inspirational to others

55:40.800 --> 55:46.640
 in different disciplines that are taking on the conventional wisdom of the day and challenging

55:46.640 --> 55:52.720
 it. What does it take to do that? What advice would you give to others like you a little bit

55:52.720 --> 55:58.800
 afraid to do so? Once you know, you cannot not know, as they say. And so I have to look in the

55:58.800 --> 56:06.560
 mirror. And then looking in the mirror, I have to face myself. Have I lived honestly? And if I

56:06.560 --> 56:16.720
 can't face myself, then what am I doing here? That's how I see it. One of the things that

56:16.720 --> 56:24.640
 people don't really talk about with drugs and people who die from some drug related death.

56:25.680 --> 56:30.160
 I've been thinking about this a whole lot over the past couple of years. It's like,

56:30.160 --> 56:37.360
 some of these drugs can take you to a place where you feel so optimistic and positive about

56:38.000 --> 56:45.840
 humans, our fellow humans. And you want to do your best to contribute because you know

56:45.840 --> 56:54.240
 the possibilities of what we can be as a society. And then you come up with resistance and like

56:54.240 --> 57:02.720
 you say, there's a lot of resistance and people just have a hard time. And so if you know humans

57:02.720 --> 57:11.840
 can be better and they refuse to be better, why be here as someone who knows that we can do this

57:11.840 --> 57:18.160
 better? I certainly don't want to do it the way we're doing it. So you kind of see drugs as

57:18.160 --> 57:25.200
 mechanisms for potentially elevating the human spirit, sort of making people feel better. So

57:25.200 --> 57:33.040
 you want to communicate that message. So it's that plus the fact that drugs that use the scapegoat

57:33.040 --> 57:38.240
 to not alleviate the suffering of certain communities. So those two things.

57:38.240 --> 57:43.920
 One of the main points of the book too was to try and get people to understand

57:43.920 --> 57:55.520
 possibilities that we could have if we embraced certain drug use. If we allowed adults to do

57:55.520 --> 58:05.440
 this sort of thing, relationships can be better. Why range of beneficial effects people would be

58:05.440 --> 58:13.600
 or can learn to be more magnanimous. All of these pro social things that we say we value.

58:15.520 --> 58:20.080
 In your previous book, High Price, you talk about rap and DJing, Chapter 5.

58:21.760 --> 58:28.800
 There's a nice picture of you DJing from 1983. So let me ask, who in your view, this is the

58:28.800 --> 58:33.360
 toughest question of this interview, is the greatest hip hop artist of all time? Maybe give

58:33.360 --> 58:39.440
 some candidates. Oh, wow. Who is the greatest hip hop artist? I don't know if I'm qualified to make

58:39.440 --> 58:50.000
 that back because I have to go back to like Gil Scott Herron. Like people think of him as one of

58:50.000 --> 58:58.720
 the fathers of hip hop. That's my all time favorite. People like Chuck D from Public Enemy,

58:58.720 --> 59:04.160
 some of the things that they were doing, I was really digging. But even though I was digging

59:04.160 --> 59:10.880
 like Public Enemy, but even they got it wrong on drugs. Even Gil Scott Herron got it wrong on

59:10.880 --> 59:19.600
 drugs. But they were doing so much other good stuff. It helped me to develop as a person.

59:19.600 --> 59:31.760
 And so I think like my son is a hip hop artist now. I think those folks who are in the game now,

59:31.760 --> 59:37.440
 they might be, they are a lot more qualified to talk about who's the greatest hip hop artist.

59:37.440 --> 59:42.800
 I'm not qualified. The evolution, I mean, have you tracked the evolution from sort of the 90s

59:42.800 --> 59:49.840
 with Wu Tang and Tupac and Biggie and then to what we have today. So there's just been a crazy

59:49.840 --> 59:55.120
 amount of progress that's like almost difficult to track. Yeah. I mean, I really love what they're

59:55.120 --> 1:00:01.440
 doing. I like what they accept the part where they get over 40 and they become fucking cops on TV.

1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:07.280
 I mean, other than that, I dig what's that about. Yeah, I don't understand that, you know, but that's

1:00:07.280 --> 1:00:16.560
 what they do. Again, this sort of glorification of cops, that's dangerous for a society. And

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:20.960
 those cats who do that kind of thing, you know, I have a problem with that.

1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:25.680
 Is it all sort of to push back a little bit because I come from the Soviet Union where there's a huge

1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:31.200
 amount of corruption. And when I see what's going on with cops in this country, there's a lot of

1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:38.480
 proper criticism you can apply, but like relative to other places. Well, in so many ways, this

1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:46.320
 country is incredible. Is your criticism towards cops or towards what cops are asked to do?

1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:52.640
 Yeah, towards what cops are asked to do. Cops provide the shield for politician

1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:59.040
 and those in power. Absolutely, because I was in the military. I spent four years in the military

1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:06.240
 and I did what I was told to do. And I was ignorant and thought I was doing the right thing.

1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:11.280
 And I did what I was told to do. And so just like these guys are doing what they're told to do.

1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:16.960
 But no, my real beef is with the power structure, the folks who are telling them what to do.

1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:26.080
 And also those folks who go play cops on television, that imagery, that sort of

1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:31.520
 glorifying cops, that's a problem in a democracy.

1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:36.320
 Yeah, all sides of the glorification of the drug war is a problem.

1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:45.200
 If I can just linger on a little longer in terms of the effects of drugs on the positive

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:54.400
 like mind expanding components of it, what have mind altering drugs teach you about the human

1:01:54.400 --> 1:02:03.520
 mind? Not even like a biochemical, but just like the human mind is amazing, right? The places it

1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:10.480
 can go. Are there some insights you've learned from studying drugs about the mind?

1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:16.560
 Yeah, can I start from a neurochemical perspective first and then we'll go larger?

1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:22.240
 Just from a neurochemical perspective, I mean, everything I know about the brain,

1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:27.520
 I learned through drugs because of my interest in drugs. So I learned a lot about dopamine

1:02:27.520 --> 1:02:33.840
 neurons and certain regions of the brain about neuropinephrine neurons and a wide range of other

1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:40.080
 sort of neural transmission happened because of drugs. And so that's a really valuable tool,

1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:46.160
 lessons for me. But then when we think that we move out a bit and we think more globally,

1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:57.040
 what have I learned in terms of the mind from drugs? I have really learned how to be more

1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:09.920
 forgiving of people and myself and more tolerant of people and certainly learned a lot more about

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:22.960
 empathy as a result of drug use. And like I said earlier, I'm learning what we can be as a species

1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:29.040
 and it's quite incredible, but because of drugs. Yeah, there's a certain property of drugs in

1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:34.800
 different ways. They take you out of your body like they help you evaluate yourself from like

1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:39.200
 a third person perspective. It's almost like you have a consciousness in here and you get to step

1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:44.240
 outside of it a little bit. I mean, that's kind of what meditation does to all of these processes.

1:03:44.240 --> 1:03:49.840
 That's sort of how of a good workout does to it. It makes you evaluate yourself and then somehow

1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:57.520
 that allows you to be forgiving to yourself and forgiving to others sort of empathize.

1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:01.920
 It trains that part of your brain. So stepping outside of yourself, not taking yourself too

1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:06.880
 seriously that process. And different drugs do that in different ways. Obviously, I don't know

1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:16.320
 from personal experience on some of them, but I'm now curious. It's unfortunate that the

1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:23.040
 Hollywood and different stories we have demonize certain drugs and sort of basically,

1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:26.640
 I don't know, make it difficult for people like me to explore those ideas, but then

1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:31.600
 I'm really thankful for people like you who are pushing the science forward and are unafraid to

1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:37.440
 talk about this kind of stuff. Because I'm really fascinated with consciousness. On the engineering

1:04:37.440 --> 1:04:44.880
 side, I really want to build robots that have elements of intelligence and motion, even consciousness.

1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:50.960
 And for that, we need to understand it in ourselves. And drugs is all the different kinds of drugs,

1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:56.160
 if you safely seems like an incredible tool to understand ourselves. And if we're limiting

1:04:56.160 --> 1:05:00.240
 ourselves from certain drugs, because of certain political games that being played,

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:08.160
 it's sad. And people know this. A lot of middle to upper class people know this.

1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:13.680
 The illicit drug trade business is a multi billion dollar industry, multi billion

1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:21.920
 dollar industry that could not be supported by people who are poor. And that has to be supported

1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:29.120
 by a lot of customers. And a lot of people around the world know this. They're in the closet. And

1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:35.280
 in the book, I call for them to get out of the closet. So we can start being more honest,

1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:39.680
 and we can take the pressure off of those people who are not as privileged.

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:46.480
 Like I said, you're brave, you're bold. I got to ask you for some advice. What advice would you

1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:53.520
 give to a young person today? High school, maybe undergrad and college, thinking about their career,

1:05:54.320 --> 1:05:56.960
 thinking about how to live a life they can be proud of.

1:05:56.960 --> 1:06:03.920
 Yeah, whatever career they choose, just make sure that they dedicate themselves to and be

1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:09.600
 the best at what they do first. That's what you have to do first. Like people see me

1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:17.680
 advocating for this position. 30 years of science is in these opinion, this view.

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:23.920
 And trust me, I would be dismissed if I didn't know my shit, if I was not.

1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:30.000
 Yeah, you did the work, you proved yourself, you're legit, and by the people in the eyes

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.960
 of the people who know. Absolutely. So that's the main thing that I would encourage people to do,

1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:42.400
 really know your craft. If you know your craft, and then maybe you will be a service to

1:06:44.160 --> 1:06:49.120
 your fellow citizens. There are so many people out here faking the phone, and they don't know

1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:55.120
 their craft, and they're not a service to the people that they claim to serve. And that's a

1:06:55.120 --> 1:07:01.200
 problem. And when you have a fairer number of people like that in positions of power,

1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:08.400
 your society is going to crumble. What about the scientific path? You recommend people get a PhD?

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:14.640
 Not necessarily. You know, like my own children, I don't recommend that. So

1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:22.080
 science can, certainly my science can be a very petty sort of space to be in.

1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:34.160
 But it was the only sort of path that I had, and so I had to do it. But I would really encourage

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:40.960
 people to just do something that they enjoy, and something that makes them happy. Because

1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:47.600
 the greater number of happy people in our society, the better off we all are.

1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:53.680
 All right. Since you mentioned happiness, gotta ask you about the pursuit of happiness and the

1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:59.760
 ridiculous question about meaning. Do you think this life has meaning? What do you think is the

1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:06.800
 meaning of life? I'm sorry. I certainly hope it has meaning. I mean, I'm certainly trying to live

1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:13.680
 mine like it has meaning. You know, I really love my life now. I just got back from Geneva.

1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:21.200
 I spent the summer abroad in Europe and trying to be in a more civilized place where you can

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:28.480
 enjoy yourself as a responsible adult. And then it allowed me to decompress and then come back here.

1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:34.480
 The thing about coming back here is that you have to be ready to fight. And I don't want to fight

1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:42.480
 anymore. I just want to be able to help a society and people. And so I'll have to keep a place in

1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:50.000
 Europe to go and decompress and then come back to be able to tolerate this situation. So life for

1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:58.720
 me has a lot of meaning. I'm enjoying life. This is the greatest, the best part of my life ever,

1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:03.440
 right now, at this moment. So it's the joy, but you also enjoy the fight a little bit?

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:11.440
 No, I don't really, I'm tired of that. You know, it's like, why? You're trying to,

1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:19.200
 I'm trying to help people to see how they can be happy. And then people are fighting me on that.

1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:23.120
 I don't want to be happy. I want to be ignorant. Leave me alone. That's what people are saying.

1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:26.640
 Well, so what is the source of joy for you when you decompress?

1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:35.360
 MDMA is a source, you know, and a place where you don't have to worry about loss. That's like

1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:43.360
 Europe. You can feel really free. Yeah. Heroin can even be a nice space if I'm in my own head.

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:51.600
 But with others, MDMA is great. So good friends, good food.

1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:59.600
 The usual. Family, love. Yeah, that's right. Carl, you're an incredible human being. You

1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:07.600
 really make me think. Everyone listens to this. I mean, I'm really glad you exist. I know you

1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:10.800
 say you don't like the fight, but I'm really glad you're fighting the fight because it's going to

1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:16.960
 help a lot of people. It's going to help, at the very least, help a lot of people think and

1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:23.040
 challenge the conventions of the day and maybe challenge them to find joy. I really appreciate

1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:26.560
 you spending your valuable time with me. This was an awesome conversation. Thank you so much

1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:31.440
 for talking to me. Thank you for having me, man. Thanks for listening to this conversation with

1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:37.280
 Carl Hart. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,

1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:44.000
 let me leave you with some words from Frank Zappa. A drug is not bad. A drug is a chemical compound.

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:49.920
 The problem comes in when people who take drugs treat them like a license to behave like an asshole.

1:10:49.920 --> 1:11:13.920
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
