00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
 The following is a conversation with Sarah Walker,

00:02.440 --> 00:05.000
 an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist

00:05.000 --> 00:08.600
 at Arizona State University and the Santa Fe Institute.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.960
 She's interested in the origin of life,

00:10.960 --> 00:13.520
 how to find life on other worlds,

00:13.520 --> 00:15.880
 and in general, the more fundamental question

00:15.880 --> 00:18.160
 of what even life is.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.280
 She seeks to discover the universal laws

00:20.280 --> 00:23.400
 that describe living systems on Earth and elsewhere,

00:23.400 --> 00:26.420
 using physics, biology, and computation.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.120
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:29.120 --> 00:33.360
 Athletic Greens, Netsuite, Blinkist, and Magic Spoon.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.280
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.400
 As a side note, let me say that my hope for this podcast

00:39.400 --> 00:42.080
 is to try and alternate between technical

00:42.080 --> 00:44.000
 and non technical discussions,

00:44.000 --> 00:45.680
 to jump from the big picture

00:45.680 --> 00:48.000
 down to specific detailed research

00:48.000 --> 00:49.800
 and back to the big picture,

00:49.800 --> 00:53.680
 and to do so with scientists and non scientists.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.320
 Long term, I hope to alternate between discussions

00:56.320 --> 00:59.880
 of cutting edge research in AI, physics, biology,

00:59.880 --> 01:03.200
 to topics of music, sport, and history,

01:03.200 --> 01:06.640
 and then back to AI, AI is home.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.200
 I hope you come along with me

01:08.200 --> 01:11.480
 for that wild, oscillating journey.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.280
 Some people message me saying to slow down

01:14.280 --> 01:15.400
 since they're falling behind

01:15.400 --> 01:17.720
 on the episodes of this podcast.

01:17.720 --> 01:19.920
 To their disappointment, I have to say

01:19.920 --> 01:22.520
 that I'll probably do more episodes, not less,

01:22.520 --> 01:25.560
 but you really don't need to listen to every episode.

01:25.560 --> 01:28.520
 Just listen to the ones that spark your curiosity.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.680
 Think about it like a party full of strangers.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.720
 You don't have to talk to everyone.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.800
 Just walk over to the ones who look interesting

01:34.800 --> 01:36.280
 and get to know them.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.400
 And if you're lucky,

01:37.400 --> 01:39.400
 that one conversation with a stranger

01:39.400 --> 01:41.640
 might change the direction of your life.

01:41.640 --> 01:42.680
 And it's the short life,

01:42.680 --> 01:44.800
 so be picky with the strangers you talk to

01:44.800 --> 01:47.520
 at this metaphorical party.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.520
 This is the Lux Friedman podcast,

01:49.520 --> 01:52.520
 and here is my conversation with Sarah Walker.

01:52.520 --> 01:55.080
 How did life originate on Earth?

01:55.080 --> 01:56.920
 What are the various hypotheses

01:56.920 --> 01:59.400
 for how life originated on Earth?

01:59.400 --> 02:02.520
 Yeah, so I guess you're asking a historical question,

02:02.520 --> 02:06.240
 which is always a good place to start thinking about life.

02:06.240 --> 02:10.040
 So there's a lot of ideas about how life started on Earth.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.280
 Probably the most popular

02:11.280 --> 02:14.920
 is what's called the RNA world scenario.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.280
 So this idea is probably the one

02:17.280 --> 02:20.360
 that you'll see most reported in the news.

02:20.360 --> 02:25.360
 And is based on the idea that there are molecules

02:27.280 --> 02:31.680
 in our bodies that relay genetic information.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.440
 We know those as DNA, obviously,

02:33.440 --> 02:37.120
 but there's also sort of an intermediary called RNA,

02:37.120 --> 02:41.280
 ribonucleic acid, that also plays the role of proteins.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.760
 And people came up with this idea in the 80s

02:44.760 --> 02:47.200
 that maybe that was the first genetic material

02:47.200 --> 02:48.600
 because it could play both roles

02:48.600 --> 02:52.400
 of being genetic and performing catalysis.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.520
 And then somehow that idea got reduced to this idea

02:55.520 --> 02:59.280
 that there was a molecule that emerged on early Earth

02:59.280 --> 03:01.640
 and underwent Darwinian evolution,

03:01.640 --> 03:03.360
 and that was the start of life.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.360
 So there's a lot of assumptions packed in there

03:06.360 --> 03:08.320
 that we could unpack,

03:08.320 --> 03:10.240
 but that's sort of the leading hypothesis.

03:10.240 --> 03:13.280
 There's also other ideas about life starting as metabolism.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.640
 And so that's more connected

03:14.640 --> 03:17.400
 to the geochemistry of early Earth.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.560
 And it would be kind of more focused on this idea

03:19.560 --> 03:22.720
 that you get some kind of catalytic cycle of molecules

03:22.720 --> 03:24.080
 that can reproduce themselves

03:24.080 --> 03:25.880
 and form some kind of metabolism.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.320
 And then life starts basically as self organization.

03:28.320 --> 03:31.280
 And then you have to explain how evolution comes later.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.560
 Right, so that's the difference between sort of energy

03:34.560 --> 03:35.680
 and genetic code.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.480
 So like energy and information,

03:37.480 --> 03:39.640
 are those the two kind of things there?

03:39.640 --> 03:42.800
 Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.360
 It's kind of funny, because I think most of the people

03:44.360 --> 03:46.800
 that think about these things are really disciplinary bias.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.520
 So the people that tend to think about genetics

03:48.520 --> 03:49.800
 come from a biology background

03:49.800 --> 03:51.640
 and they're really evolution focused.

03:51.640 --> 03:52.960
 And so they're worried about

03:52.960 --> 03:54.600
 where does the information come from

03:54.600 --> 03:55.840
 and how does it change over time?

03:55.840 --> 03:57.920
 But they're talking about information in a really narrow way

03:57.920 --> 04:00.440
 where they're talking about a genetic sequence.

04:00.440 --> 04:04.040
 And then most of the people that think about metabolism,

04:04.040 --> 04:06.960
 origins of life scenarios tend to be people like physicists

04:06.960 --> 04:08.560
 or geochemists that are worried about

04:08.560 --> 04:09.600
 what are the energy sources

04:09.600 --> 04:11.920
 and what kinds of organization

04:11.920 --> 04:14.120
 can you get out of those energy sources?

04:14.120 --> 04:15.920
 Okay, so which one is your favorite?

04:15.920 --> 04:17.520
 I don't like either.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.400
 Okay, can we talk about them for a little bit longer though?

04:20.400 --> 04:21.720
 Yeah, no, that's fine.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.080
 So okay, so there's early earth.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.040
 What was that like?

04:27.040 --> 04:29.240
 Was there just mostly covered by oceans?

04:29.240 --> 04:31.720
 Was there heat sources, energy sources?

04:31.720 --> 04:35.280
 So if we talk about the metabolism view

04:35.280 --> 04:36.560
 of the origin of life,

04:36.560 --> 04:38.440
 like where was the source of energy?

04:38.440 --> 04:39.720
 Probably the most popular view

04:39.720 --> 04:42.240
 for where the original life happened on earth

04:42.240 --> 04:43.760
 is hydrothermal vents,

04:43.760 --> 04:45.560
 because they had sufficient energy.

04:45.560 --> 04:50.200
 And so we don't really know a lot about early earth.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.240
 We have some ideas

04:52.240 --> 04:54.080
 about when oceans first formed and things like that,

04:54.080 --> 04:56.960
 but the time of the origin of life is kind of

04:56.960 --> 04:59.120
 not well understood or pinned down

04:59.120 --> 05:02.240
 and the conditions on earth at that time are not well known.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.600
 But a lot of people do think

05:03.600 --> 05:05.600
 that there was probably hydrothermal vents

05:05.600 --> 05:10.040
 which are really hot chemically active regions

05:10.040 --> 05:12.680
 say on the sea floor in modern times,

05:12.680 --> 05:14.760
 which also would have been present on early earth

05:14.760 --> 05:18.000
 and they would have provided energy and organics

05:18.000 --> 05:20.200
 and basically all of the right conditions

05:20.200 --> 05:22.480
 for the origins of life,

05:22.480 --> 05:23.320
 which is one of the reasons

05:23.320 --> 05:24.880
 that we look for these hydrothermal systems

05:24.880 --> 05:27.320
 when we're talking about life elsewhere too.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.240
 Okay, and for the genetic code,

05:30.080 --> 05:32.200
 the idea is that the RNA is the first,

05:32.200 --> 05:35.840
 like why would RNA be the first moment

05:35.840 --> 05:37.640
 you can say it's life?

05:37.640 --> 05:42.120
 I guess the idea is it could both have persistent information

05:42.120 --> 05:45.120
 and then it can also do some of the work

05:45.120 --> 05:49.080
 of like what, creating a self sustaining organism?

05:49.080 --> 05:50.920
 Yeah, that's the basic idea.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.560
 So the idea is you have in an RNA molecule,

05:54.560 --> 05:56.280
 you have a sequence of characters say,

05:56.280 --> 05:58.760
 so you can treat it like a string in a computer

05:58.760 --> 06:00.000
 and it can be copied.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.720
 So information can be propagated,

06:02.720 --> 06:05.960
 which is important for evolution

06:05.960 --> 06:07.360
 because evolution happens

06:07.360 --> 06:09.520
 by having inheritance of information.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.600
 So for example, like my eyes are brown

06:11.600 --> 06:13.880
 because my mother's eyes were brown.

06:13.880 --> 06:16.200
 So you need that copying of information,

06:16.200 --> 06:21.200
 but then you also have the ability to perform catalysis,

06:22.040 --> 06:24.400
 which means that that RNA molecule

06:24.400 --> 06:26.040
 is not inert in that environment,

06:26.040 --> 06:27.960
 but it actually interacts with something

06:27.960 --> 06:31.280
 and could potentially mediate, say a metabolism

06:31.280 --> 06:34.000
 that could then fuel the actual reproduction

06:34.000 --> 06:35.400
 of that molecule.

06:35.400 --> 06:40.400
 So in some ways, people think that RNA gives you, you know,

06:42.120 --> 06:44.480
 the most bang for your buck in a single molecule.

06:44.480 --> 06:47.200
 And therefore, you know, it gives you all the features

06:47.200 --> 06:48.920
 that you might think are life.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.320
 And so this is sort of where this RNA world conjecture

06:52.320 --> 06:54.560
 came from is because of those two properties.

06:54.560 --> 06:59.080
 Isn't it amazing that RNA came to be in general?

06:59.080 --> 07:01.080
 Isn't it? Yes, that is amazing.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.640
 Okay, so we're not talking down about RNA.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.800
 No, no, I love RNA.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.200
 It's one of my favorite molecules.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.240
 I think it's beautiful.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.760
 It's just not step one.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.800
 Yeah, I think the issue,

07:10.800 --> 07:12.960
 it's not even the RNA world is a problem.

07:12.960 --> 07:16.800
 And actually, if you really dig into it,

07:16.800 --> 07:19.320
 the RNA world is not one hypothesis.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.240
 It is a set of hypothesis, hypothesis, sorry.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.920
 And they range from a molecule of RNA

07:25.920 --> 07:28.560
 spontaneously emerged on the early earth

07:28.560 --> 07:29.680
 and started evolving,

07:29.680 --> 07:31.760
 which is kind of like the hardest RNA world scenario,

07:31.760 --> 07:32.760
 which is the one I cited.

07:32.760 --> 07:36.560
 And I get a little animated about

07:36.560 --> 07:39.280
 because it seems so blatantly wrong to me,

07:39.280 --> 07:40.680
 but that's a separate story.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.080
 And then the other one is actually something I agree with,

07:43.080 --> 07:46.440
 which is that you can say there was an RNA world

07:46.440 --> 07:49.120
 because RNA was the first genetic material

07:49.120 --> 07:50.320
 for life on earth.

07:50.320 --> 07:54.720
 So an RNA world could just be the earliest organisms

07:54.720 --> 07:57.520
 that had genetics in a modern sense

07:57.520 --> 08:01.120
 didn't have DNA evolved yet, they had RNA, right?

08:01.120 --> 08:03.760
 And so that's sort of a softer RNA world scenario

08:03.760 --> 08:05.160
 in the sense that it doesn't mean

08:05.160 --> 08:07.160
 it was the first thing that happened,

08:07.160 --> 08:10.400
 but it was a thing that definitely was part

08:10.400 --> 08:12.760
 of the lineage of events that led to us.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.280
 So if life was like a best of album,

08:16.280 --> 08:17.240
 it would be on the,

08:17.240 --> 08:18.840
 it'd be one of the songs on there.

08:18.840 --> 08:19.880
 Yes. One of the early songs.

08:19.880 --> 08:20.720
 Okay.

08:20.720 --> 08:21.640
 It's on the greatest hits.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.720
 Greatest hits, that's the word I was looking for.

08:23.720 --> 08:28.040
 Okay, did life, do you think originate once,

08:28.040 --> 08:30.720
 twice, three times on earth, multiple times?

08:30.720 --> 08:31.760
 What do you think?

08:31.760 --> 08:33.880
 I think that's a really difficult question.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.480
 Is it an important question?

08:35.480 --> 08:36.680
 It's a super important question.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.000
 No, that's, no, it's a really important question.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.600
 And so there's some, so there's,

08:42.600 --> 08:45.520
 there's a lot of questions in that question.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.560
 So one of the first ones that I think needs to be addressed

08:48.560 --> 08:50.960
 is is the original life a continuous process

08:50.960 --> 08:52.000
 on our planet?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.360
 So we think about the original life as something

08:54.360 --> 08:58.160
 that happened on earth, say almost four billion years ago

08:58.160 --> 09:00.600
 because we have evidence of life emerging very early

09:00.600 --> 09:01.480
 on our planet.

09:02.680 --> 09:06.080
 And then an original life event, quote unquote,

09:06.080 --> 09:08.600
 a singular event, whatever that was happened.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.400
 And then all life on earth that we know

09:11.400 --> 09:13.760
 is a descendant of that particular event

09:13.760 --> 09:14.760
 in our universe, right?

09:14.760 --> 09:19.760
 And so, but we don't have any idea one way or the other

09:21.920 --> 09:25.000
 if the original life is happening repeatedly

09:25.000 --> 09:26.280
 and maybe it's just not taking off

09:26.280 --> 09:27.600
 because life is already established.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.520
 That's an argument that people will make

09:29.520 --> 09:33.080
 or maybe there are alternative forms of life on earth

09:33.080 --> 09:35.280
 that we don't even recognize.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.800
 So this is the idea of a shadow biosphere

09:36.800 --> 09:38.520
 that there actually might just be completely

09:38.520 --> 09:40.440
 other life on earth, but it's so alien

09:40.440 --> 09:42.880
 that we don't even know what it is.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.320
 I'm gonna have to talk to you about the shadow biosphere.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.360
 Yeah, that's a fun one.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.920
 In a second, but first let me ask

09:47.920 --> 09:51.360
 for the other alternative, which is panspermia.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.200
 Right.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.240
 So that's the idea, the hypothesis that life exists

09:55.240 --> 09:57.240
 elsewhere in the universe and got to us

09:57.240 --> 09:59.840
 and we're like an asteroid or a planetoid

09:59.840 --> 10:02.600
 or some according to Wikipedia space dust,

10:02.600 --> 10:06.000
 whatever the heck that is, it sounds fun.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.200
 But basically it wrote along whatever kind of rock

10:10.200 --> 10:11.760
 and got to us.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.960
 Do you think that's at all a possibility?

10:14.960 --> 10:15.800
 Sure.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.040
 So I think the reason that most original life scientists

10:19.040 --> 10:20.800
 are interested in the original life on earth

10:20.800 --> 10:25.000
 and say not the original life on Mars

10:25.000 --> 10:28.440
 and then panspermia, the exchange of life between planets

10:28.440 --> 10:30.920
 being the explanation is once you start removing

10:30.920 --> 10:32.480
 the original life from earth, you know,

10:32.480 --> 10:36.040
 even less about it than you do if you study it on earth.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.760
 Although I think there are ways of reformulating the problem.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.440
 This is why I said earlier, like,

10:40.440 --> 10:42.440
 oh, you mean the historical original life problem.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.960
 You don't mean the problem of how does life arise

10:44.960 --> 10:47.320
 in the universe and what the universal principles are

10:47.320 --> 10:48.760
 because there's this historic problem.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.280
 How did it happen on early earth?

10:50.280 --> 10:53.120
 And there's a more tractable general problem

10:53.120 --> 10:56.240
 of how does it happen and how does it happen

10:56.240 --> 10:57.840
 is something we can actually ask in the lab.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.760
 How did it happen on early earth

11:00.760 --> 11:04.240
 is a much more detailed and nuanced question

11:04.240 --> 11:06.520
 and requires detailed knowledge of what was happening

11:06.520 --> 11:08.560
 on early earth that we don't have.

11:08.560 --> 11:11.400
 And I'm personally more interested in general mechanisms.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.200
 So to me, it doesn't matter if it happened on earth

11:13.200 --> 11:15.200
 or it happened on Mars.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.680
 It just matters that it happened.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.520
 We have evidence that happened.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.200
 The question is, did it happen more than once

11:20.200 --> 11:21.320
 in our universe?

11:21.320 --> 11:25.920
 And so the reason I don't find Panspermia as a particularly,

11:25.920 --> 11:28.720
 I think it's a fascinating hypothesis.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.000
 I definitely think it's possible.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.800
 And I in particular think it's possible

11:33.800 --> 11:35.040
 once you get to the stage of a life

11:35.040 --> 11:36.120
 where you have technology

11:36.120 --> 11:40.240
 because then you obviously can spread out into the cosmos.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.960
 But it's also possible for microbes

11:41.960 --> 11:45.440
 because we know that certain microorganisms

11:45.440 --> 11:47.000
 can survive the journey in space

11:47.000 --> 11:50.960
 and they can live in a rock and go between Mars and earth.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.000
 Like people have done experiments

11:52.000 --> 11:54.160
 to try to prove that could work.

11:54.160 --> 11:57.120
 So in that scenario, it's super cool

11:57.120 --> 11:58.360
 because then you get planetary exchange.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.600
 But say we go find, we go look for life on Mars

12:00.600 --> 12:02.160
 and it ends up being exactly the same life

12:02.160 --> 12:04.400
 we have on earth biochemically speaking.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.760
 Then we haven't really discovered something new

12:05.760 --> 12:07.000
 about the universe.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.640
 What kind of aliens are possible?

12:08.640 --> 12:10.800
 Were there other original life events?

12:10.800 --> 12:13.000
 If we find, if all the life we ever find

12:13.000 --> 12:14.760
 is the same original life event in the universe,

12:14.760 --> 12:16.600
 it doesn't help me solve my problem.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.440
 But it's possible that that would be a sign

12:19.440 --> 12:22.280
 that you could separate the environment

12:22.280 --> 12:24.840
 from the basic ingredients.

12:24.840 --> 12:25.880
 Yes, that's true.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.880
 So you can have like a life gun

12:27.880 --> 12:30.160
 that you shoot throughout the universe.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.080
 And then like once you shoot it,

12:33.080 --> 12:34.920
 I think the Simpsons were the make up gun.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.320
 That was a great episode.

12:36.320 --> 12:40.920
 When you shoot this life gun, it'll find the earths.

12:40.920 --> 12:44.160
 It'll like get sticky, it'll stick to the earths.

12:44.160 --> 12:48.880
 And that kind of reduces the barrier of like the time

12:48.880 --> 12:52.840
 it takes, the luck it takes to actually from nothing,

12:52.840 --> 12:55.560
 from the basic chemistry, from the basic physics

12:55.560 --> 12:58.520
 in the universe for the life to spring up.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.760
 Yeah, I think this is actually super important.

13:00.760 --> 13:05.480
 Just think about like does life getting seeded on a planet

13:05.480 --> 13:08.840
 have to be geochemically compatible with that planet?

13:08.840 --> 13:11.320
 So you're suggesting like we could just shoot guns in space

13:11.320 --> 13:13.160
 and like life could go to Mars

13:13.160 --> 13:16.480
 and then it would just live there and be happy there.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.400
 But that's actually an open question.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.040
 So one of the things I was gonna say in response

13:20.040 --> 13:22.640
 to your question about whether the original life

13:22.640 --> 13:24.440
 happened once or multiple times

13:24.440 --> 13:25.840
 is for me personally right now,

13:25.840 --> 13:28.400
 am I thinking all this changes on a weekly basis?

13:28.400 --> 13:31.760
 But is that I think of life more as a planetary phenomena.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.680
 So I think the original life because life is so

13:35.680 --> 13:38.840
 intimately tied to planetary cycles and planetary processes.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.000
 And this goes all the way back

13:40.000 --> 13:41.560
 through the history of our planet,

13:41.560 --> 13:44.240
 that the original life itself grew out of geochemistry

13:44.240 --> 13:46.320
 and became coupled and controlled geochemistry.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.160
 And when we start to talk about life existing on the planet

13:49.160 --> 13:51.240
 is when we have evidence of life

13:51.240 --> 13:54.120
 actually influencing properties of the planet.

13:55.080 --> 13:59.240
 And so if life is a planetary property,

13:59.240 --> 14:01.680
 then going to Mars is not a trivial thing

14:01.680 --> 14:05.520
 because you basically have to make Mars more Earth like.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.400
 And so in some sense, like when I think about

14:08.400 --> 14:11.680
 sort of longterm vision of humans in space, for example,

14:11.680 --> 14:14.040
 really what you're talking about when you're saying,

14:14.040 --> 14:17.400
 let's send our civilization to Mars is you're not saying,

14:17.400 --> 14:18.680
 let's send our civilization to Mars.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.920
 You're saying, let's reproduce our planet on Mars.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.360
 Like the information from our planet actually has to go to Mars

14:24.360 --> 14:26.200
 and make Mars more Earth like,

14:26.200 --> 14:28.560
 which means that you're now having a reproduction process

14:28.560 --> 14:31.000
 like a cell reproduces itself to propagate information

14:31.000 --> 14:32.560
 in the future.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.280
 Planets have to figure out how to reproduce their conditions

14:35.280 --> 14:38.000
 including geochemical conditions on other planets

14:38.000 --> 14:40.360
 in order to actually reproduce life in the universe.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.680
 Which is kind of a little bit radical,

14:41.680 --> 14:44.680
 but I think for longterm sustainability of life

14:44.680 --> 14:47.280
 on the planet, that's absolutely essential.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.120
 Okay.

14:48.120 --> 14:52.800
 So if we were to think about life as a planetary phenomena,

14:52.800 --> 14:55.120
 and so life on Mars would be best

14:55.120 --> 14:57.600
 if it's way different than life on Earth,

14:57.600 --> 15:02.600
 we have to ask the very basic question of what is life?

15:03.360 --> 15:06.200
 I actually don't think that's the right question to ask.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.720
 It took me a long time to get there, right?

15:07.720 --> 15:08.800
 You cross it out.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.640
 Yeah, you cross it off your list, it's wrong.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.040
 Next question.

15:13.040 --> 15:13.880
 No, no, no.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.240
 I mean, I think it has an answer,

15:15.240 --> 15:17.920
 but I think the part of the problem is,

15:17.920 --> 15:20.040
 most of the places in science where we get really stuck

15:20.040 --> 15:22.280
 is because we don't know what questions to ask.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.040
 And so you can't answer a question

15:24.040 --> 15:25.880
 if you're asking the wrong question.

15:25.880 --> 15:29.600
 And I think the way I think about it is,

15:29.600 --> 15:31.200
 obviously I'm interested in what life is.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.480
 So I'm being a little cheeky when I say,

15:32.480 --> 15:33.600
 that's the wrong question to ask.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.440
 That's exactly like the question

15:35.440 --> 15:37.080
 that's like the core of my existence.

15:37.080 --> 15:41.320
 But I think the way of framing that is,

15:41.320 --> 15:44.960
 what is it about our universe that allows features

15:44.960 --> 15:47.480
 that we associate life to be there?

15:47.480 --> 15:50.360
 And so really, I guess when I'm asking that question,

15:50.360 --> 15:52.680
 what I'm after is an explanatory framework

15:52.680 --> 15:54.360
 for what life is, right?

15:54.360 --> 15:57.440
 And so most people, they try to go in and define life

15:57.440 --> 15:59.720
 and they say, well, life is, say,

15:59.720 --> 16:01.720
 a self reproducing chemical system

16:01.720 --> 16:03.040
 capable of Darwinian evolution.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.480
 That's a very popular definition for life.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.360
 Or life is something that metabolizes and eats.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.120
 That is not how I think about life.

16:10.120 --> 16:13.320
 What I think about life is there are principles

16:13.320 --> 16:15.680
 and laws that govern our universe

16:15.680 --> 16:18.040
 that we don't understand yet

16:18.040 --> 16:20.480
 that have something to do with

16:20.480 --> 16:23.680
 how information interacts with the physical world.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.360
 I don't know exactly what I mean, even when I say that

16:26.360 --> 16:28.520
 because we don't know these rules.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.200
 But it's a little bit like, I like to use analogies.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.520
 You give me time to be like a little long winded

16:34.520 --> 16:36.720
 for a second, even in essay.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.280
 But if you look at the history of physics, for example,

16:40.280 --> 16:43.600
 this is like, so we are in the period of the development

16:43.600 --> 16:46.160
 of thought on our planet

16:46.160 --> 16:49.160
 where we don't understand what we are yet, right?

16:49.160 --> 16:51.680
 There was a period of thought in the history of our planet

16:51.680 --> 16:54.000
 where we didn't understand what gravity was.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.760
 And we didn't understand, for example,

16:55.760 --> 16:59.360
 that the planets in the heavens were actually planets

16:59.360 --> 17:02.080
 or that they operated by the same laws that we did.

17:02.080 --> 17:05.160
 And so there has been this sort of progression

17:05.160 --> 17:07.440
 of getting a deeper understanding

17:07.440 --> 17:09.560
 of explaining basic phenomena like,

17:09.560 --> 17:11.920
 I'm not gonna drop the cup, I'll drop the water bottle.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.120
 Okay, that fell, right?

17:13.120 --> 17:14.280
 But why did that fall?

17:16.280 --> 17:19.200
 This is why I'm a theorist, not an experiment specialist.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.960
 I could have gone wrong in so many ways.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.680
 I know, I could have, especially if I did the cup

17:22.680 --> 17:23.680
 and it smashed.

17:23.680 --> 17:28.680
 Anyway, so if you take this view

17:28.680 --> 17:30.440
 that there's sort of some missing principles,

17:30.440 --> 17:33.680
 I associate them to information.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.360
 And what the sort of feeling there is,

17:36.360 --> 17:39.040
 there's some missing explanatory framework

17:39.040 --> 17:40.400
 for how our universe works.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.360
 And if we understood that physics,

17:42.360 --> 17:44.520
 it would explain what we are.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.200
 It might also explain a lot of other features

17:46.200 --> 17:48.600
 we don't associate to life.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.680
 And so it's a little like,

17:50.680 --> 17:52.440
 people accept the fact that gravity

17:52.440 --> 17:54.320
 is a universal phenomena.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.520
 But when we wanna study gravity,

17:55.520 --> 18:00.040
 we study things like large scale galactic structures

18:00.040 --> 18:02.680
 or black holes or planets.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.360
 If we wanna understand information

18:04.360 --> 18:05.840
 and how it operates in the physical world,

18:05.840 --> 18:08.360
 we study intelligent systems or living systems

18:08.360 --> 18:10.960
 because they are the manifestation of that physics.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.880
 And the fact that we can't see that clearly yet

18:13.880 --> 18:15.680
 or we don't have that explanatory framework,

18:15.680 --> 18:17.440
 I think it's just because we haven't been thinking

18:17.440 --> 18:18.680
 about the problem deeply enough.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.440
 But I feel like if you're explaining something,

18:21.440 --> 18:24.120
 you're deriving it from some more fundamental property.

18:24.120 --> 18:28.760
 And of course, I have to say I'm wearing my physicist hat.

18:28.760 --> 18:33.200
 So I have a huge bias of liking simple elegant explanations

18:33.200 --> 18:37.360
 of the universe that really are compelling.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.360
 But I think one of the things that I've sort of maybe

18:40.360 --> 18:42.560
 in some ways rejected my training as a physicist

18:42.560 --> 18:44.560
 is that most of the elegant explanations

18:44.560 --> 18:47.240
 that we have so far don't include us in the universe.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.760
 And I can't help but think there's something really special

18:49.760 --> 18:51.720
 about what we are and there have to be some deep principles

18:51.720 --> 18:52.560
 at play there.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.440
 And so that's sort of my perspective on it.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.440
 Now, when you ask me what life is,

18:59.440 --> 19:02.040
 I have some ideas of what I think it is.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.840
 But I think that we haven't gotten there yet

19:04.840 --> 19:07.440
 because we haven't been able to see that structure.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.320
 And just to go back to the gravity example,

19:09.320 --> 19:12.400
 it's a little like in ancient times they didn't know,

19:12.400 --> 19:14.560
 I was talking about stars and heavens and things,

19:14.560 --> 19:16.800
 they didn't know those were governed

19:16.800 --> 19:19.280
 by the same principles as that started experiment.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.920
 Here's where I was going with it.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.840
 Once you realize like Newton did that,

19:23.840 --> 19:25.800
 heavenly motions and earthly motions

19:25.800 --> 19:27.120
 are governed by the same principles

19:27.120 --> 19:29.080
 and you unify terrestrial and celestial motion,

19:29.080 --> 19:31.240
 you get these more powerful ideas.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.000
 And I think where life is,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.440
 is somehow unifying these abstract ideas

19:36.440 --> 19:39.680
 of computation and information with the physical world,

19:39.680 --> 19:42.760
 with matter and realizing that there's some

19:42.760 --> 19:45.080
 explanatory framework that's not physics

19:45.080 --> 19:49.640
 and it's not computation, but it's something that's deeper.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.120
 So answering the question of what is life

19:52.120 --> 19:55.960
 requires deeply understanding something about the universe

19:55.960 --> 19:58.880
 as information processing, the universe's computation.

19:58.880 --> 19:59.720
 Sort of.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.920
 Something about, like would,

20:01.920 --> 20:04.920
 once you come up with an answer to what is life,

20:04.920 --> 20:07.240
 will the words information and computation

20:07.240 --> 20:08.520
 be in the paragraph?

20:08.520 --> 20:09.560
 No, I don't think so.

20:09.560 --> 20:10.520
 Oh, damn it, okay.

20:10.520 --> 20:11.840
 I know, it doesn't help, does it?

20:11.840 --> 20:14.040
 I know, I hate, actually I hate this about what I do

20:14.040 --> 20:15.560
 because it's so hard to communicate, right?

20:15.560 --> 20:17.960
 With words, like when you have words

20:17.960 --> 20:22.720
 that are ideas that have historically described one thing

20:22.720 --> 20:24.240
 and you're trying to describe something

20:24.240 --> 20:27.920
 that people haven't seen yet and the words just don't fit.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.320
 So what's wrong?

20:29.320 --> 20:31.600
 Is it too ambiguous, the word information?

20:31.600 --> 20:33.400
 We could switch to binary if you want.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.480
 Yeah, no, I don't think it's binary either.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.000
 I think information is just loaded.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.280
 I use it, so the other way I might talk about it

20:39.280 --> 20:42.000
 is the physics of causation, but I think that's worse

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
 because causation is even more loaded word

20:44.000 --> 20:46.840
 than information.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.800
 So causation is fundamental, you think?

20:48.800 --> 20:49.640
 I do, yeah.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.240
 And in some sense, I think the physics,

20:52.240 --> 20:53.800
 so this is the really radical part,

20:53.800 --> 20:55.560
 in some sense, like when I really think about it

20:55.560 --> 20:58.520
 sort of most deeply, what I think life is

20:58.520 --> 21:00.200
 is actually the physics of existence,

21:00.200 --> 21:02.840
 what gets to exist and why.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.800
 And for simple elementary particles,

21:04.800 --> 21:05.840
 that's not very complicated

21:05.840 --> 21:07.000
 because the interactions are simple,

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
 but for things like you and me and human civilizations,

21:12.120 --> 21:13.520
 what comes next in the universe

21:13.520 --> 21:15.680
 is really dependent on what came before.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.360
 And there's a huge space of possibilities

21:17.360 --> 21:18.520
 of things that can exist.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.560
 And when I say information and causation,

21:20.560 --> 21:24.920
 what I mean is why is it that cups evolved in the universe

21:24.920 --> 21:27.560
 and not some other object that could deliver water

21:27.560 --> 21:28.600
 and not spill it?

21:29.760 --> 21:31.600
 I don't know what you would call it.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.920
 Maybe it wouldn't be a cup, but it's a huge,

21:33.920 --> 21:38.400
 it's, people talk about the space of things

21:38.400 --> 21:40.880
 that could exist as being actually infinitely large, right?

21:40.880 --> 21:43.480
 I don't know if I believe in infinity,

21:43.480 --> 21:47.440
 but I do think that there is something very interesting

21:47.440 --> 21:52.440
 about the problem of what exists in its relationship to life.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.720
 So do you think the set of things

21:55.720 --> 21:58.920
 that could exist as finite is very large?

21:58.920 --> 22:02.680
 But like if we were to think about the physics of existence,

22:04.040 --> 22:06.920
 like how many shapes of mugs can there be?

22:06.920 --> 22:10.080
 Like it is an initial programming.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.040
 I should go to the math department for that.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.720
 So that's not a topology question.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.760
 I just mean maybe another way to ask is,

22:17.760 --> 22:20.360
 what do you think is fundamental to the universe

22:20.360 --> 22:21.640
 and what is emergent?

22:21.640 --> 22:24.800
 So if existence, are we supposed to think of that

22:24.800 --> 22:26.920
 as somehow fundamental, you think?

22:26.920 --> 22:28.640
 So there's a couple of problems in physics

22:28.640 --> 22:29.840
 that I think this is related to.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.320
 One is why does mathematics work at describing reality so well?

22:33.320 --> 22:36.480
 And then there is this problem of we don't understand

22:36.480 --> 22:38.800
 why the laws of physics are the way they are

22:38.800 --> 22:40.640
 or why certain things get to exist

22:40.640 --> 22:43.840
 or what put in place the initial condition of our universe,

22:43.840 --> 22:44.680
 right?

22:44.680 --> 22:47.440
 There's all of these sort of really deep and big problems

22:47.440 --> 22:51.480
 and they all indirectly are related,

22:51.480 --> 22:54.040
 I think to the same kind of thing that,

22:55.440 --> 22:57.560
 our physics is really good if you specify

22:57.560 --> 22:59.680
 the initial condition at specifying

22:59.680 --> 23:01.000
 a certain sequence of events,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.160
 but it doesn't deal with the fact

23:03.160 --> 23:04.960
 that other things could have happened,

23:04.960 --> 23:06.640
 which is kind of an informational property

23:06.640 --> 23:08.280
 like a counterfactual property.

23:09.480 --> 23:12.280
 And it's not good at explaining,

23:12.280 --> 23:14.920
 you know, this conversation right now,

23:14.920 --> 23:16.840
 it's just, there are certain things

23:16.840 --> 23:19.640
 that are outside the explanatory reach of current physics

23:19.640 --> 23:22.920
 and I think they require looking at it

23:22.920 --> 23:25.080
 from a completely different direction.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.000
 And so I don't wanna have to fine tune

23:27.000 --> 23:28.880
 the initial condition of the universe

23:28.880 --> 23:30.760
 to specify precisely all the information

23:30.760 --> 23:31.600
 in this conversation.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.640
 I think that's a ridiculous assertion,

23:33.640 --> 23:35.640
 but that's sort of like how people wanna frame it

23:35.640 --> 23:38.520
 when they're talking about, you know,

23:38.520 --> 23:40.600
 the standard model is sufficient

23:40.600 --> 23:42.920
 if we had computing power to basically explain

23:42.920 --> 23:44.680
 all of life in our existence.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.280
 An interesting thing you said is,

23:46.280 --> 23:48.640
 the way we think about information and computation

23:48.640 --> 23:53.360
 is by observing a particular kind of systems on Earth

23:53.360 --> 23:56.840
 that exhibit something we think of as intelligence,

23:56.840 --> 24:00.000
 but that's like looking at, I guess,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.160
 the tip of an iceberg and we should be really looking

24:02.160 --> 24:04.760
 at the fundamentals of like the iceberg,

24:04.760 --> 24:08.880
 like what makes water and ice

24:08.880 --> 24:12.440
 and the chemistry from which intelligence

24:12.440 --> 24:13.400
 emerges essentially.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.720
 Yes, yes.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.160
 We can't just couple the information from the physics

24:17.160 --> 24:19.320
 and I think that's what we've gotten really good at doing,

24:19.320 --> 24:23.560
 especially with sort of the modern age

24:23.560 --> 24:28.560
 where, you know, software is so abstracted from hardware.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.840
 But the entire process of biological evolution

24:31.840 --> 24:33.360
 has basically been built,

24:33.360 --> 24:36.760
 like been building layers of increasing abstraction.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.360
 And so it's really hard to see that physics in us,

24:39.360 --> 24:42.560
 but it's much clearer to see it in molecules.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.840
 Yeah, but I guess I'm trying to figure out

24:44.840 --> 24:47.720
 what do you think are the best tools to look at it?

24:48.640 --> 24:49.480
 What do you think?

24:50.400 --> 24:51.720
 An open mind?

24:51.720 --> 24:52.560
 Is that a tool?

24:53.520 --> 24:55.400
 What's the physics of an open mind?

24:56.680 --> 24:58.640
 I think if we solve that, we'll solve everything.

24:58.640 --> 24:59.720
 I'm saying an open mind

24:59.720 --> 25:02.520
 because I think the biggest stumbling block

25:03.720 --> 25:05.960
 to understand sort of the things

25:05.960 --> 25:07.280
 I've been trying to articulate

25:07.280 --> 25:09.000
 or and when I talk also with colleagues

25:09.000 --> 25:11.640
 that are thinking deeply about these same issues

25:11.640 --> 25:15.400
 is none of it is inconsistent with what we know.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.240
 It's just such a radically different perception

25:18.240 --> 25:19.680
 of the way we understand things now

25:19.680 --> 25:21.280
 that it's hard for people to get there.

25:21.280 --> 25:24.240
 And in some ways you have to almost forget what you've learned

25:24.240 --> 25:25.840
 in order to learn something new, right?

25:25.840 --> 25:27.880
 So I feel like most of my career

25:27.880 --> 25:29.880
 trying to understand the problem of life

25:29.880 --> 25:32.440
 has been variously forgetting

25:32.440 --> 25:35.600
 and then relearning things that I learned in physics

25:35.600 --> 25:40.600
 and I think you have to have a capacity to learn things

25:41.760 --> 25:44.440
 but then accept that things that you learned

25:44.440 --> 25:45.520
 might not be true

25:48.600 --> 25:50.840
 or might need refinement or reframing.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.280
 And the best way I can say that

25:53.280 --> 25:54.640
 is just like with a physics education

25:54.640 --> 25:56.880
 there are just certain things you're told in undergrad

25:56.880 --> 25:58.920
 that are like facts about the world.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.240
 And your physics professors never tell you

26:01.240 --> 26:04.240
 that those facts actually emerge from a human mind, right?

26:04.240 --> 26:06.320
 So we're taught to think about say the laws of physics

26:06.320 --> 26:09.400
 for example, as this like autonomous thing

26:09.400 --> 26:10.720
 that exists outside of our universe

26:10.720 --> 26:12.440
 and tells our universe how it works.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.440
 But the laws of physics were invented by human minds

26:15.440 --> 26:17.400
 to describe things that are regularities

26:17.400 --> 26:19.360
 in our everyday experience.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.560
 They don't exist autonomous to the universe.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.880
 Right, so it's like turtles on top of turtles

26:23.880 --> 26:26.320
 but eventually gets to the human mind

26:26.320 --> 26:29.120
 and then you have to explain the human mind with the turtles.

26:29.120 --> 26:29.960
 Yes.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.560
 So you have to, it comes from humans,

26:32.560 --> 26:34.760
 this understanding, this simplification of the universe,

26:34.760 --> 26:36.320
 these models.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.240
 There's a guy named Stephen Wolf from,

26:38.240 --> 26:42.000
 there's a concept called cellular automata.

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
 So there's some mysteries in these systems

26:47.560 --> 26:49.400
 that are computational in nature

26:49.400 --> 26:54.000
 that have maybe echoes of the kind of mysteries

26:54.000 --> 26:57.800
 we should need to solve to understand what is life.

26:57.800 --> 27:02.800
 So if we could talk, take a computational view of things,

27:04.600 --> 27:06.200
 do you think there's something compelling

27:06.200 --> 27:09.840
 to reducing everything down to computation

27:09.840 --> 27:12.040
 like the universe's computation

27:12.040 --> 27:15.240
 and then trying to understand life.

27:15.240 --> 27:18.880
 So throw away the biology, throw away the chemistry,

27:18.880 --> 27:20.080
 throw away even the physics

27:20.080 --> 27:22.920
 that you learn undergrad and graduate school

27:22.920 --> 27:25.920
 and a more look at these simple little systems

27:25.920 --> 27:27.840
 whether it's cellular automata or whatever

27:27.840 --> 27:29.640
 the heck kind of computational systems

27:29.640 --> 27:31.560
 that operate on simple local rules

27:31.560 --> 27:35.240
 and then create complexity as they evolve.

27:36.200 --> 27:39.440
 Is it at all, do you think productive

27:39.440 --> 27:42.080
 to focus on those kinds of systems

27:42.080 --> 27:44.200
 to get an inkling of what is life?

27:44.200 --> 27:48.720
 And if it is, do you think it's possible

27:48.720 --> 27:51.600
 to come up with some kind of laws and principles

27:51.600 --> 27:56.120
 about what makes life in those computational systems?

27:56.120 --> 27:57.440
 So I like cellular automata.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.600
 I think they're good toy models,

27:59.600 --> 28:01.960
 but mostly like where I've thought about them

28:01.960 --> 28:03.840
 and use them is to actually,

28:06.800 --> 28:10.360
 let's say poke at sort of the current conceptual framework

28:10.360 --> 28:12.280
 that we have and see where the flaws are.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.640
 So I think like the part that you're talking about

28:15.640 --> 28:17.240
 that people find intriguing is that

28:17.240 --> 28:19.680
 if you have like a fairly simple rule

28:19.680 --> 28:21.600
 and you specify some initial condition

28:21.600 --> 28:23.480
 and you run that rule on that initial condition

28:23.480 --> 28:26.480
 you could get really complex patterns emerging.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.400
 And ooh, doesn't that look life like?

28:31.120 --> 28:32.680
 Well, it's like really surprising.

28:32.680 --> 28:35.200
 It is really surprising and they're beautiful.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.760
 And I think they have a lot of nice features

28:37.760 --> 28:39.680
 associated to them.

28:39.680 --> 28:42.560
 I think the things that I find, yeah.

28:42.560 --> 28:46.440
 So I do think as a proof of principle

28:46.440 --> 28:48.040
 that you can get complex things emerging

28:48.040 --> 28:50.440
 from simple rules, they're great.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.520
 As a sort of proof of principle

28:52.520 --> 28:56.720
 about some of the ways that we might think of computation

28:56.720 --> 28:59.400
 as being sort of a fundamental principle

28:59.400 --> 29:00.720
 for dynamical systems

29:00.720 --> 29:03.240
 and maybe the evolution of the universe as a whole,

29:03.240 --> 29:05.640
 they're a great model system.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.800
 As an explanatory framework for life,

29:07.800 --> 29:10.840
 I think they're a bit problematic

29:10.840 --> 29:14.080
 for the same reason that the laws of physics

29:14.080 --> 29:16.280
 are a bit problematic.

29:16.280 --> 29:20.120
 And the clearest way I can articulate that is

29:20.120 --> 29:22.400
 like cellular automata are actually cast

29:22.400 --> 29:24.800
 in sort of a conceptual framework

29:24.800 --> 29:26.520
 for how the universe should be described

29:26.520 --> 29:29.600
 that goes all the way back to Newton, in fact,

29:29.600 --> 29:33.680
 with this idea that we can have a fixed law of motion

29:33.680 --> 29:36.080
 which exists sort of, it's given to you.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.720
 You know, the great programmer in the sky

29:38.720 --> 29:41.520
 gave you this equation or this rule

29:41.520 --> 29:43.360
 and then you just run with it.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.560
 And the rule doesn't have, so a good feature of the rule

29:46.560 --> 29:49.120
 is it doesn't have specified in the rule

29:49.120 --> 29:51.040
 information about the patterns it generates.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.320
 So you wouldn't want, for example,

29:53.320 --> 29:56.960
 the my cup or my water bottle or me sitting here

29:56.960 --> 29:58.560
 to be specified in the laws of physics,

29:58.560 --> 29:59.400
 that would be ridiculous

29:59.400 --> 30:01.160
 because it wouldn't be a very simple explanation

30:01.160 --> 30:02.000
 of all the things happening,

30:02.000 --> 30:03.560
 it'd have to explain everything.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.120
 So cellular automata have that feature

30:06.120 --> 30:08.400
 and the laws of physics have that feature.

30:08.400 --> 30:13.120
 But, you know, you also need to specify the initial condition.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.320
 And it also, it basically means that everything

30:16.320 --> 30:18.560
 that happens is sort of a consequence

30:18.560 --> 30:19.880
 of that initial condition.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.800
 And I think this kind of framework

30:21.800 --> 30:25.080
 is just not the right one for biology.

30:25.080 --> 30:28.280
 And part of the way that it's easiest to see this

30:28.280 --> 30:31.880
 is a lot of people talk about self reference

30:31.880 --> 30:33.480
 being important in life.

30:33.480 --> 30:36.880
 The fact that, you know, like the genome

30:36.880 --> 30:39.280
 has information encoded in it,

30:39.280 --> 30:41.720
 that information gets read out.

30:41.720 --> 30:45.160
 It specifies something about the architecture of a cell.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.080
 The architecture of the cell includes the genome.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.840
 So the genome has basically self referential information.

30:49.840 --> 30:53.040
 Self reference obviously comes up in computational law

30:53.040 --> 30:56.720
 because it's kind of foundational to Turing's work

30:56.720 --> 30:58.960
 and what Girtle did with the incompleteness theorems

30:58.960 --> 30:59.800
 and things.

30:59.800 --> 31:02.600
 So there's a lot of parallels there

31:02.600 --> 31:05.440
 and people have talked about that at depth.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.840
 But the other way of kind of thinking about it

31:06.840 --> 31:10.160
 in terms of like a more physicsy way of talking about it

31:10.160 --> 31:12.320
 is that what it looks like in biology

31:12.320 --> 31:15.960
 is that the rules or the laws depend on the state.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.360
 This is typical in computer science.

31:17.360 --> 31:18.920
 This is obvious to you.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.000
 The update rule depends on the state of the machine.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.560
 But you don't think about that being sort

31:25.560 --> 31:28.120
 of the dynamic in physics.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.240
 The rule is given to you and then it's

31:30.240 --> 31:32.760
 a very special subclass, say, of computations

31:32.760 --> 31:36.640
 if you don't ever change the update.

31:36.640 --> 31:39.080
 But in biology, it seems to be that the state and the law

31:39.080 --> 31:41.040
 change together as a function of time.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.840
 And we don't have that as a paradigm in physics.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.680
 And so a lot of people talk about this

31:45.680 --> 31:47.640
 as being kind of a perplexing feature

31:47.640 --> 31:51.200
 that maybe there are certain scenarios where the laws of physics

31:51.200 --> 31:53.080
 or the laws that govern a particular system

31:53.080 --> 31:56.640
 actually change as a function of the state of that system.

31:56.640 --> 31:57.480
 That's trippy.

31:57.480 --> 32:01.680
 So yeah, the hope of physics, it's a hope, I guess,

32:01.680 --> 32:05.440
 but often stated as an underlying assumption

32:05.440 --> 32:08.800
 is that the law is static.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.160
 Right.

32:10.160 --> 32:10.760
 OK.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.840
 And even having laws that vary in time,

32:12.840 --> 32:16.920
 not even as a function of the state, is very radical when you.

32:16.920 --> 32:17.960
 The time in general.

32:17.960 --> 32:21.080
 Like, you want to remove time from the equation

32:21.080 --> 32:22.120
 as much as possible.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.280
 Yeah, I do.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.640
 There's some interesting things in this,

32:25.640 --> 32:29.160
 like when we think more deeply about the actual physics

32:29.160 --> 32:31.880
 that we're trying to propose governs life with me

32:31.880 --> 32:33.800
 with collaborators and then also other people that

32:33.800 --> 32:36.080
 think about similar things, that time might actually

32:36.080 --> 32:39.440
 be fundamental and there really is an ordering to time.

32:39.440 --> 32:41.080
 And that events in the universe are unique

32:41.080 --> 32:42.920
 because they have a particular, you know,

32:42.920 --> 32:45.240
 they happen like an object in the universe

32:45.240 --> 32:48.280
 requires a certain history of events in order to exist,

32:48.280 --> 32:49.880
 which therefore suggests that time really

32:49.880 --> 32:50.640
 does have an ordering.

32:50.640 --> 32:51.680
 I'm not talking about the flow of time

32:51.680 --> 32:53.720
 and our perception of time, just the ordering of events.

32:53.720 --> 32:54.560
 The causation of things.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.360
 Yes, causation.

32:55.360 --> 32:56.720
 There's that word again.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.520
 So causation, when you say time, you mean causation.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.840
 Yes.

33:00.840 --> 33:05.440
 In your proposed model of the physics of life,

33:05.440 --> 33:08.360
 the fundamental thing would be causation.

33:08.360 --> 33:11.640
 If you were to bet your money on one particular horse

33:11.640 --> 33:12.480
 or whatever.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.280
 Yes.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.520
 And then space is emergent.

33:15.520 --> 33:16.160
 Yes.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.160
 So everything is emergent except time.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.120
 Kind of, yeah, or causation.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.760
 And laws change all the time.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.880
 Why does it look like laws are the same?

33:24.880 --> 33:28.800
 Well, because, well, one way, and I actually,

33:28.800 --> 33:30.520
 this idea comes from Lee Cronin because I work with him

33:30.520 --> 33:33.040
 very closely on these things, is that the laws of physics

33:33.040 --> 33:35.440
 look the way they do because they're low memory laws.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.840
 So they don't require a lot of information to specify them.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.760
 They're very easy for the universe to implement.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.080
 But if you get something like me, for example,

33:42.080 --> 33:44.560
 I require a 4 billion year history to exist in the universe.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.080
 I come with a lot of historical baggage.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.360
 And that's part of what I am as a set of causes

33:49.360 --> 33:52.640
 that exist in the universe.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.200
 So I have local rules that apply to me

33:55.200 --> 33:58.320
 that are associated with the information in my history

33:58.320 --> 34:01.440
 that aren't universal to every object in the universe.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.400
 And there are some things that are very easy to implement,

34:04.400 --> 34:08.800
 low memory rules that apply to everything in the universe.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.640
 So there's no shortcuts to you.

34:10.640 --> 34:11.400
 No.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.600
 So yeah, I don't believe in things like Boltzmann Brains

34:13.600 --> 34:18.320
 or fluctuations out of the vacuum that can produce things

34:18.320 --> 34:21.480
 like your desk ornaments.

34:21.480 --> 34:24.520
 I actually think they require a particular causal chain

34:24.520 --> 34:26.520
 of events to exist.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.200
 Well, I appreciate the togetherness of that.

34:29.200 --> 34:34.040
 So how does that, if we have to simulate the entire universe

34:34.040 --> 34:37.120
 to create the ornaments and the two of us,

34:37.120 --> 34:42.880
 how are we supposed to create engineer life in a lab?

34:42.880 --> 34:45.480
 This goes back to the critique of the RNA world.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.480
 I think one of the problems, and I'll

34:47.480 --> 34:48.960
 get to answer your question, but I think this

34:48.960 --> 34:51.400
 is kind of relevant here, one of the problems of the RNA

34:51.400 --> 34:54.240
 world when we test it in the laboratory

34:54.240 --> 34:57.280
 is how much information we're putting into the experiment.

34:57.280 --> 35:00.920
 We specify the flasks, we make pure reagents, we mix them,

35:00.920 --> 35:03.400
 we take them out, we put them in the next flask,

35:03.400 --> 35:05.600
 we change the pH, we change the UV light,

35:05.600 --> 35:07.080
 and then we get a molecule.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.040
 And it's not even an RNA molecule necessarily,

35:09.040 --> 35:11.120
 it might just be a base.

35:11.120 --> 35:14.640
 And so people don't usually think about the fact

35:14.640 --> 35:17.840
 that we're agents in the universe making that experiment,

35:17.840 --> 35:21.840
 and therefore we put a little bit of life into that experiment,

35:21.840 --> 35:23.720
 because it's part of our biological lineage

35:23.720 --> 35:26.800
 in the same sense that I am a part of the biological lineage.

35:26.800 --> 35:31.880
 Our ideas are injecting life to the experiment.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.120
 And the constraints that we put on the experiments,

35:34.120 --> 35:36.720
 because those conditions wouldn't exist in the universe

35:36.720 --> 35:39.160
 on planet Earth at that time without us

35:39.160 --> 35:41.520
 as the boundary condition, right?

35:41.520 --> 35:43.920
 Even though we're not actually adding any actual like

35:43.920 --> 35:48.080
 chemistry or biology that could be identified as life,

35:48.080 --> 35:49.760
 the constraints we're adding to the experiment,

35:49.760 --> 35:51.080
 the design of the experiment.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.040
 Yeah, you can think of the design experiment as a program.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.280
 You put information in.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.720
 It's an algorithmic procedure

35:55.720 --> 35:57.160
 that you design the experiment.

35:57.160 --> 36:01.000
 And so the origin life problem becomes one

36:01.000 --> 36:04.880
 of minimizing the information we put into physics

36:04.880 --> 36:07.160
 to actually watch the spontaneous origin of life.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.840
 Can we have, so is it possible in the lab

36:09.840 --> 36:12.160
 to have an information vacuum then?

36:12.160 --> 36:13.000
 So like...

36:13.000 --> 36:14.960
 If we could, we would, that would be amazing.

36:14.960 --> 36:15.800
 I don't know.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.680
 That's a good question for Lee.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.680
 Yeah, you guys, by the way,

36:18.680 --> 36:20.160
 for people who don't know Lee Cronin,

36:20.160 --> 36:23.160
 is you guys are colleagues.

36:23.160 --> 36:25.720
 And I've gotten the chance to listen

36:25.720 --> 36:26.960
 to the two of you talking.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.240
 There's great chemistry

36:28.240 --> 36:30.560
 and your brilliant brainstorming together.

36:30.560 --> 36:34.120
 And there's a really exciting community here

36:34.120 --> 36:36.880
 of brilliant people from different disciplines

36:36.880 --> 36:39.800
 working on the problem of life, of complexity,

36:39.800 --> 36:42.400
 of, I don't know, whatever.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.200
 The words fail us to describe the exact problem

36:45.200 --> 36:47.280
 we're trying to actually understand here.

36:47.280 --> 36:50.200
 Intelligence, all those kinds of things.

36:50.200 --> 36:55.200
 Okay, so what, from a lab perspective.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.840
 So Lee, I guess, would you call him a chemist?

36:57.840 --> 36:58.680
 No?

36:58.680 --> 37:00.160
 I think by training, he's a chemist.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.720
 But I think most of the people that work in the field,

37:01.720 --> 37:03.400
 we do have lost their discipline.

37:03.400 --> 37:07.280
 That's why I couldn't answer your question earlier.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.720
 I don't know what you call him.

37:08.720 --> 37:09.880
 I don't know what I call myself.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.880
 I don't know what I call any of my friends.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.880
 So why is it so hard to create,

37:14.880 --> 37:16.920
 and it's an interesting question

37:16.920 --> 37:19.400
 to create biological life in the lab.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.840
 Like from your perspective,

37:21.840 --> 37:24.000
 is that an important problem to work on

37:24.000 --> 37:29.200
 to try to recreate the historical origin of life on earth

37:29.200 --> 37:31.160
 or echoes of the historical origin?

37:31.160 --> 37:32.800
 I think echoes is more appropriate.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.960
 I don't think asking the question

37:34.960 --> 37:37.720
 of what was the exact historical sequence of events

37:37.720 --> 37:40.480
 and engineering every step in the process

37:40.480 --> 37:43.000
 to make exactly the chemistry of life on earth

37:43.000 --> 37:46.360
 as we know it is a meaningful way of asking the question.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.840
 And it's a little bit like,

37:49.720 --> 37:51.000
 since you're in computer science,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.480
 like if you know the answer to a problem,

37:53.480 --> 37:56.040
 it's easier to find a program to specify the output, right?

37:56.040 --> 37:58.360
 But if you don't know the answer a priori,

37:58.360 --> 38:00.080
 finding an algorithm for like say,

38:00.080 --> 38:01.080
 finding a prime or something,

38:01.080 --> 38:05.040
 it's easy to verify it's a prime number.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.520
 It's hard to find the next prime.

38:07.520 --> 38:11.000
 And the way the original life is structured right now

38:11.000 --> 38:14.320
 and the historical problem is you know the answer

38:14.320 --> 38:15.640
 and you're trying to retroject it

38:15.640 --> 38:17.600
 by breaking it down into the set of procedures

38:17.600 --> 38:19.480
 where you're putting a lot of information in.

38:19.480 --> 38:22.520
 And what we need to do is ask the question of,

38:22.520 --> 38:26.200
 how is it that the rules of how our universe is structured

38:26.200 --> 38:28.120
 permit things like life to exist

38:28.120 --> 38:29.800
 and what is the phenomena of life?

38:29.800 --> 38:31.840
 And those questions are obviously essentially

38:31.840 --> 38:33.120
 the same question.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.080
 And so you're looking essentially

38:35.080 --> 38:37.880
 for this missing physics,

38:37.880 --> 38:39.760
 this missing explanation for what we are.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.720
 And you need to set up proper experiments

38:41.720 --> 38:43.520
 that are gonna allow you to probe

38:43.520 --> 38:46.200
 the vast complexity of chemistry

38:46.200 --> 38:48.640
 in an unconstrained way with as little information

38:48.640 --> 38:52.120
 put in as possible to see when things,

38:52.120 --> 38:53.960
 when does information actually emerge?

38:53.960 --> 38:55.360
 How does it emerge?

38:55.360 --> 38:56.200
 What is it?

38:57.320 --> 39:01.040
 And part of the sort of conjecture we have is

39:01.040 --> 39:03.160
 that this physics only becomes relevant

39:03.160 --> 39:05.800
 or at least this is my personal conjecture

39:05.800 --> 39:09.880
 and it's sort of validated by this kind of theory experiment

39:09.880 --> 39:14.880
 collaboration that we have working in this area.

39:15.040 --> 39:17.120
 That this sort of, I mean,

39:17.120 --> 39:19.680
 I made the point about like gravity existing everywhere, right?

39:19.680 --> 39:22.240
 But when you study an atomic nucleus,

39:22.240 --> 39:23.360
 you don't care about gravity,

39:23.360 --> 39:24.920
 it's not relevant physics there, right?

39:24.920 --> 39:26.840
 It's weak, it doesn't matter.

39:27.640 --> 39:31.600
 And so this idea that there's kind of a physics

39:31.600 --> 39:33.760
 associated with information,

39:33.760 --> 39:37.280
 for me, it's very evident that that physics

39:37.280 --> 39:39.920
 doesn't become relevant until you need information

39:39.920 --> 39:42.560
 to specify the existence of a particular object.

39:42.560 --> 39:45.120
 And the scale of reality where that happens

39:45.120 --> 39:48.600
 is in chemistry because of the combinatorial diversity

39:48.600 --> 39:52.680
 of chemical objects that can exist far out exceeds

39:52.680 --> 39:54.680
 the amount of resources in our universe.

39:54.680 --> 39:57.600
 So if you want it, you can't make every possible protein

39:57.600 --> 40:01.920
 of lengths, 200 amino acids is not enough resources.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.080
 So in order to, for this particular protein to exist

40:05.080 --> 40:07.560
 and this protein to exist in high abundance

40:07.560 --> 40:10.640
 means that you have to have a system that has knowledge

40:10.640 --> 40:12.920
 of the existence of that protein and can build it.

40:12.920 --> 40:15.600
 So existence comes to be at the chemical level.

40:15.600 --> 40:19.680
 So existence is most, is best understood

40:19.680 --> 40:20.720
 at the chemical level.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.080
 It's most evident.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.840
 It's a little bit like nobody argues

40:23.840 --> 40:25.840
 that gravity doesn't exist in atomic nucleus.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.880
 It's just not relevant physics there, right?

40:27.880 --> 40:30.640
 So the physics of information is everywhere.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.520
 It exists at every combinatorial scale,

40:32.520 --> 40:34.200
 but it becomes more and more relevant

40:34.200 --> 40:36.760
 the more set of possibilities that could exist

40:36.760 --> 40:39.400
 because you're, you have to specify more and more

40:39.400 --> 40:41.800
 about why this thing exists and not the infinite.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.360
 It's not an infinite set, but you know,

40:43.360 --> 40:46.160
 the set of undefined set of other things that could exist.

40:46.160 --> 40:50.600
 So can I ask a weird question, which is,

40:50.600 --> 40:52.320
 so let's look into the future.

40:53.640 --> 40:56.200
 I try that every day, it never works.

40:56.200 --> 41:00.160
 So say a Nobel Prize is given in physics,

41:00.160 --> 41:05.160
 maybe chemistry, for discovering the origin of life.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.200
 No, but not the historical origin.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.480
 Some kind of thing that we're talking about.

41:12.680 --> 41:17.680
 What exactly would, what do you think that like,

41:20.720 --> 41:23.600
 what do you think that person maybe you did

41:23.600 --> 41:24.760
 to get that Nobel Prize?

41:24.760 --> 41:26.280
 Like what would they have to have done?

41:26.280 --> 41:27.840
 Cause you could do a bunch of experiments

41:27.840 --> 41:30.720
 that go like within the aha moment.

41:30.720 --> 41:33.800
 Like you rarely get the Nobel Prize

41:33.800 --> 41:37.120
 for like you've solved everything, we're done.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.960
 It's like some inkling of some deep truth.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.280
 Like what do you think that would actually look like?

41:43.280 --> 41:45.200
 Would it be an experimental result?

41:46.480 --> 41:48.920
 I mean, it will have to have some kind of experimental

41:48.920 --> 41:50.360
 maybe validation component.

41:50.360 --> 41:52.320
 So what would that look like?

41:52.320 --> 41:54.680
 This is an excellent question.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.280
 I wanna, sorry, I'm gonna make a quick point,

41:57.280 --> 41:58.760
 which is just a slight tangent,

41:58.760 --> 42:01.320
 but like when people ask about the origin of mass

42:01.320 --> 42:03.320
 and like looking for the Higgs mechanism and things,

42:03.320 --> 42:04.280
 they never are like,

42:04.280 --> 42:06.360
 we need to find the historical origins of life

42:06.360 --> 42:08.480
 in the early, although those things are related, right?

42:08.480 --> 42:11.480
 So this problem of origins of life in the lab,

42:11.480 --> 42:12.680
 I think is really important,

42:12.680 --> 42:14.560
 but the Higgs is a good example

42:14.560 --> 42:16.000
 because you had theory to guide it.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.400
 So somehow you need to have an explanatory framework

42:20.520 --> 42:24.800
 that can say that we should be looking for these features

42:24.800 --> 42:27.880
 and explain why they might be there

42:27.880 --> 42:29.520
 and then be able to do the experiment

42:29.520 --> 42:31.520
 and demonstrate that it matches with the theory,

42:31.520 --> 42:34.280
 but it has to be something that is outside

42:34.280 --> 42:36.280
 sort of the paradigm of what we might expect

42:36.280 --> 42:37.480
 based on what we know, right?

42:37.480 --> 42:39.520
 So this is a really sort of tall order.

42:40.400 --> 42:44.760
 And I think, I mean,

42:44.760 --> 42:46.840
 I guess the way people would think about it is like,

42:46.840 --> 42:49.320
 if you had a bacteria that climbed out of your test tube

42:49.320 --> 42:50.480
 or something and it was like,

42:50.480 --> 42:51.600
 moving around on the surface,

42:51.600 --> 42:52.960
 that would be ultimate validation.

42:52.960 --> 42:55.080
 You saw the original life in an experiment,

42:55.080 --> 42:57.400
 but I don't think that's quite what we're looking for.

42:57.400 --> 43:01.920
 I think what we're looking for is evidence

43:01.920 --> 43:06.000
 of when information that originated

43:06.000 --> 43:08.360
 within the balance of your experiment

43:08.360 --> 43:11.920
 and you can demonstratably prove a merge spontaneously

43:11.920 --> 43:14.560
 in your experiment wasn't put in by you,

43:14.560 --> 43:17.720
 actually started to govern the future dynamics

43:17.720 --> 43:20.120
 of that system and specify it.

43:20.120 --> 43:23.520
 And you could somehow relate those two features directly.

43:23.520 --> 43:26.240
 So you know that the program specifying

43:26.240 --> 43:27.520
 what's happening in that system

43:27.520 --> 43:29.680
 is actually internal to that system.

43:29.680 --> 43:32.080
 Like say you have a chemical thing in a box.

43:32.080 --> 43:36.320
 Well, so that's one Nobel Prize winning experiment,

43:36.320 --> 43:39.920
 which is like information in some fundamental way

43:39.920 --> 43:42.840
 originated within the constraints of the system

43:42.840 --> 43:44.560
 without you injecting anything.

43:44.560 --> 43:49.160
 But another experiment is you injected something.

43:49.160 --> 43:50.120
 Yeah.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.080
 And got out information.

43:52.080 --> 43:52.920
 Yes.

43:52.920 --> 43:55.720
 So like you injected, I don't know,

43:55.720 --> 43:59.960
 like some sugar and like something

43:59.960 --> 44:03.400
 that doesn't necessarily feel like it should be information.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.400
 Yeah, so I actually know,

44:05.400 --> 44:07.120
 I mean, sugar is information, right?

44:07.120 --> 44:08.320
 So part of the argument here

44:08.320 --> 44:11.400
 is that every physical object is,

44:11.400 --> 44:12.880
 well, it's information,

44:12.880 --> 44:14.600
 but it's a set of causal histories

44:14.600 --> 44:16.640
 and also a set of possible futures.

44:16.640 --> 44:20.520
 So there is an experiment that I've talked a lot about

44:20.520 --> 44:22.120
 with Lee Cronin, but also with Michael Lachman

44:22.120 --> 44:23.920
 and Chris Kempis who are at Santa Fe

44:23.920 --> 44:25.800
 about this idea that sometimes we talk about

44:25.800 --> 44:27.920
 as like seeding assembly,

44:27.920 --> 44:30.560
 which is you take a high complexity,

44:30.560 --> 44:32.880
 like an object that exists in the universe

44:32.880 --> 44:34.880
 because of a long causal history

44:34.880 --> 44:38.600
 and you seed it into a system of lower causal history.

44:38.600 --> 44:40.840
 And then suddenly you see all of this complexity

44:40.840 --> 44:42.000
 being generated.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.920
 So I think another validation of the physics

44:43.920 --> 44:46.960
 would be, say you engineer an organism

44:46.960 --> 44:49.760
 by purposefully introducing something

44:49.760 --> 44:51.240
 where you understand the relationship

44:51.240 --> 44:54.080
 between the causal history of the organism

44:54.080 --> 44:57.560
 and the say very complex chemical set of ingredients

44:57.560 --> 44:58.920
 you're adding to it.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.960
 And then you can predict the future evolution

45:00.960 --> 45:05.880
 of that system to some statistical set of constraints

45:05.880 --> 45:10.080
 and possibilities for what it will look like in the future.

45:11.320 --> 45:12.880
 You know, I'm a physical structure obviously,

45:12.880 --> 45:15.240
 like I'm composed of atoms.

45:15.240 --> 45:16.680
 The configuration of them

45:16.680 --> 45:19.360
 and the fact that they happen to be me

45:19.360 --> 45:22.040
 is because I'm not actually my atoms.

45:22.040 --> 45:24.680
 I am a informational pattern

45:24.680 --> 45:28.080
 that keeps repatterning those atoms into Sarah.

45:28.920 --> 45:33.840
 And I have also associated to me like a space

45:33.840 --> 45:36.200
 of possible things that could exist

45:36.200 --> 45:38.200
 that I can help mediate come into existence

45:38.200 --> 45:41.200
 because of the information in my history.

45:41.200 --> 45:45.200
 And so when you understand sort of that

45:45.200 --> 45:49.120
 time is a real thing embedded in a physical object,

45:50.120 --> 45:52.960
 then it becomes possible to talk about

45:52.960 --> 45:57.000
 how histories, when they interact,

45:57.000 --> 45:58.440
 and history is not a unique thing.

45:58.440 --> 45:59.960
 It's a set of possibilities.

45:59.960 --> 46:00.800
 When they interact,

46:00.800 --> 46:03.240
 how do they specify what's coming next?

46:03.240 --> 46:04.640
 And then where does the novelty come from

46:04.640 --> 46:05.480
 in that structure?

46:05.480 --> 46:06.640
 Because some of it is kind of things

46:06.640 --> 46:07.840
 that haven't existed in the past,

46:07.840 --> 46:09.160
 can exist in the future.

46:09.160 --> 46:12.800
 Let me ask about this entity that you call Sarah.

46:12.800 --> 46:14.120
 Yes.

46:14.120 --> 46:16.840
 I talk to myself about myself in third person sometimes.

46:16.840 --> 46:17.680
 I don't know why.

46:19.400 --> 46:22.400
 So maybe this is a good time to bring up consciousness.

46:22.400 --> 46:23.240
 Sure.

46:24.800 --> 46:26.560
 It's been here all along.

46:26.560 --> 46:28.200
 Well, has it?

46:28.200 --> 46:30.520
 So at least in this conversation,

46:30.520 --> 46:31.920
 I think I've been conscious most of it,

46:31.920 --> 46:32.760
 but maybe I haven't.

46:32.760 --> 46:34.800
 Well, yes, so speak for yourself.

46:34.800 --> 46:37.960
 You're projecting your consciousness onto me.

46:37.960 --> 46:39.760
 You don't know if I'm conscious or not.

46:39.760 --> 46:41.080
 No, I don't.

46:41.080 --> 46:41.920
 You're right.

46:41.920 --> 46:45.120
 Is that, he talked about the physics of existence.

46:45.120 --> 46:50.040
 He talked about the emergence of causality,

46:50.040 --> 46:52.720
 sorry, you talked about causality and time

46:52.720 --> 46:54.560
 being fundamental to the universe.

46:55.520 --> 46:58.440
 Where does consciousness fit into all of this?

46:58.440 --> 47:02.560
 Like, do you draw any kind of inspiration

47:02.560 --> 47:05.440
 or value with the idea of panpsychism

47:05.440 --> 47:09.720
 that maybe one of the things that we ought to understand

47:09.720 --> 47:12.040
 is the physics of consciousness?

47:12.040 --> 47:15.200
 Like one of the missing pieces

47:15.200 --> 47:17.480
 in the physics view of the world

47:17.480 --> 47:20.440
 is understanding the physics of consciousness.

47:20.440 --> 47:24.840
 Or like that word has so many concepts underneath it,

47:24.840 --> 47:29.120
 but let's put consciousness as a label

47:29.120 --> 47:32.360
 on a black box of mystery that we don't understand.

47:32.360 --> 47:36.560
 Do you think that black box holds the key

47:36.560 --> 47:40.760
 to finally answering the question of the physics of life?

47:40.760 --> 47:42.280
 The problems are absolutely related.

47:42.280 --> 47:44.720
 I think most, and I'm interested in both

47:44.720 --> 47:46.320
 because I'm just interested in what we are.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.120
 And to me, the most interesting feature

47:48.120 --> 47:49.440
 of what we are is our minds

47:49.440 --> 47:51.320
 and the way they interact with our minds.

47:51.320 --> 47:52.680
 Like minds are the most beautiful thing

47:52.680 --> 47:53.560
 that exists in the universe.

47:53.560 --> 47:55.320
 So how do they come to be?

47:55.320 --> 47:56.240
 Sorry to interrupt.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.480
 So when you say we, you mean humans.

47:58.480 --> 48:01.560
 I mean humans right now, but that's because I'm a human.

48:01.560 --> 48:02.400
 Or at least I think I am.

48:02.400 --> 48:05.040
 You think there's something special to this particular?

48:05.040 --> 48:06.480
 No, no, no, no, no.

48:06.480 --> 48:11.280
 No, I don't, I'm not a human centric thinker.

48:11.280 --> 48:12.560
 But are you one entity?

48:12.560 --> 48:15.400
 You said a bunch of stuff came together to make a Sarah.

48:15.400 --> 48:18.200
 Like do you think of yourself as one entity?

48:18.200 --> 48:20.760
 Or are you just a bunch of different components?

48:20.760 --> 48:23.760
 Like is there any value to understand the physics of Sarah?

48:23.760 --> 48:26.360
 Like, or are you just a bunch of different things

48:26.360 --> 48:30.080
 that are like a nice little temporary side effect?

48:30.080 --> 48:33.040
 Yeah, you could think of me as a bundle of information

48:33.040 --> 48:34.800
 that just became temporarily aggregated

48:34.800 --> 48:35.880
 into our individual.

48:35.880 --> 48:37.280
 Yeah, that's fine.

48:37.280 --> 48:38.280
 I agree with that view.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.240
 I'll take that as a compliment actually.

48:42.240 --> 48:45.120
 But you've, but nevertheless,

48:45.120 --> 48:47.840
 that bundle of information has become conscious.

48:47.840 --> 48:51.000
 At least keeps calling herself conscious.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.600
 Yeah, I think I'm conscious right now,

48:52.600 --> 48:55.080
 but I might not be, but that's okay.

48:55.080 --> 48:56.360
 Or you wouldn't know.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.720
 So yeah, so this is the problem.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.640
 So yeah, usually people when they are talking

48:59.640 --> 49:00.920
 about consciousness are worried

49:00.920 --> 49:02.280
 about the subjective experience.

49:02.280 --> 49:04.120
 And so I think that's why you're saying,

49:04.120 --> 49:05.080
 I don't know if you're conscious

49:05.080 --> 49:06.880
 because I don't know if you're experiencing

49:06.880 --> 49:08.280
 this conversation right now.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.480
 And nor do you know if I'm experiencing

49:11.480 --> 49:12.960
 the conversation right now.

49:12.960 --> 49:14.280
 And so this is why this is called

49:14.280 --> 49:15.400
 the hard problem of consciousness

49:15.400 --> 49:17.520
 because it seems impenetrable from the outside

49:17.520 --> 49:20.520
 to know if something's having a conscious experience.

49:21.520 --> 49:24.800
 And I really like the idea of also like

49:24.800 --> 49:26.200
 the hard problem of matter,

49:26.200 --> 49:28.920
 which is related to the hard problem of consciousness,

49:28.920 --> 49:31.600
 which is you don't know the intrinsic properties

49:31.600 --> 49:33.320
 of an electron not interacting,

49:33.320 --> 49:35.240
 say for example, with anything else in the universe.

49:35.240 --> 49:37.200
 All the properties of anything

49:37.200 --> 49:39.480
 that exists in the universe are defined by its interaction

49:39.480 --> 49:40.920
 because you have to interact with it

49:40.920 --> 49:42.440
 in order to be able to observe it.

49:42.440 --> 49:44.520
 So we can only actually know the things

49:44.520 --> 49:46.280
 that are observable from the outside.

49:46.280 --> 49:47.720
 And so this is one of the reasons

49:47.720 --> 49:49.400
 that consciousness is hard for science

49:49.400 --> 49:51.080
 because you're asking questions

49:51.080 --> 49:52.720
 about something that's subjective

49:52.720 --> 49:55.480
 and supposed to be intrinsic to what that thing is

49:55.480 --> 49:59.160
 as it exists and how it feels about existing.

49:59.160 --> 50:02.520
 And so I have thought a lot about this problem

50:02.520 --> 50:05.400
 and its relationship to the problem of life.

50:05.400 --> 50:07.160
 And the only thing I can come up with

50:07.160 --> 50:12.160
 to try to make that problem scientifically tractable

50:12.920 --> 50:17.920
 and also related to how I think about the physics of life

50:17.920 --> 50:20.320
 is to ask the question,

50:20.320 --> 50:23.480
 are there things that can only happen in the universe

50:23.480 --> 50:26.240
 because there are physical systems

50:26.240 --> 50:28.760
 that have subjective experience?

50:28.760 --> 50:32.640
 So does subjective experience have different causes?

50:32.640 --> 50:35.040
 That things that it can cause to occur

50:36.320 --> 50:38.600
 that would happen in the absence of that?

50:38.600 --> 50:40.080
 I don't know the answer to that question,

50:40.080 --> 50:42.080
 but I think that's a meaningful way

50:42.080 --> 50:43.600
 of asking the question of consciousness.

50:43.600 --> 50:46.600
 I can't ask if you're having experience right now,

50:46.600 --> 50:49.160
 but I can ask if you having experience right now

50:49.160 --> 50:50.840
 changes something about you

50:50.840 --> 50:53.720
 and the way you interact with the world.

50:53.720 --> 50:56.360
 So does stuff happen?

50:56.360 --> 50:57.880
 It's a good question to ask.

50:57.880 --> 51:00.240
 Does stuff happen if consciousness is?

51:01.320 --> 51:03.120
 Then it's a real physical thing, right?

51:03.120 --> 51:04.400
 It has physical consequences.

51:04.400 --> 51:05.600
 I'm a physicist, I'm biased.

51:05.600 --> 51:08.160
 So I don't, you know, I can't get rid of that bias.

51:08.160 --> 51:10.280
 It's really deeply ingrained.

51:10.280 --> 51:12.080
 I've tried, but it's hard.

51:12.080 --> 51:14.600
 But I mean, you're saying information is physical too.

51:14.600 --> 51:16.360
 So like virtual reality and simulation,

51:16.360 --> 51:18.240
 all the program is physical too.

51:18.240 --> 51:19.360
 Yes, everything's physical.

51:19.360 --> 51:22.880
 It's just not physical the way it's represented in our minds.

51:22.880 --> 51:23.720
 Right.

51:23.720 --> 51:25.520
 So you, I love your Twitter.

51:25.520 --> 51:29.720
 So you tweet these like deep thoughts and deep thoughts.

51:29.720 --> 51:33.320
 That's what a theorist does when she's trying to experiment.

51:33.320 --> 51:34.160
 Is tweet?

51:34.160 --> 51:36.320
 It's like sitting there.

51:36.320 --> 51:39.080
 I mean, I can just imagine you sitting there for like hours

51:39.080 --> 51:41.400
 and all of a sudden just like this thought comes out

51:41.400 --> 51:46.400
 and we get a little like inkling into the thought process.

51:46.840 --> 51:47.680
 Yeah, usually it's like

51:47.680 --> 51:50.920
 when I'm running between things and I'm talking about deep thoughts.

51:50.920 --> 51:51.880
 Well, yeah.

51:51.880 --> 51:52.720
 So you...

51:52.720 --> 51:53.680
 Deep thoughts are hard to articulate.

51:53.680 --> 51:56.600
 One of the things you tweet is ideologically,

51:56.600 --> 51:58.720
 there are many parallels between the search

51:58.720 --> 52:01.680
 for neural correlates of consciousness

52:01.680 --> 52:04.280
 and for chemical correlates of life.

52:04.280 --> 52:07.520
 How the neuroscience and astrobiology communities

52:07.520 --> 52:10.520
 treat those correlates is entirely different.

52:10.520 --> 52:13.360
 Can you elaborate against this kind of...

52:13.360 --> 52:14.200
 Yeah.

52:14.200 --> 52:15.680
 The parallels, it has to do a little bit

52:15.680 --> 52:19.080
 with the consciousness and the matter thing

52:19.080 --> 52:20.120
 you're talking about.

52:20.120 --> 52:20.960
 Yeah, it does.

52:20.960 --> 52:23.040
 And I can't remember what state of mind I was

52:23.040 --> 52:24.440
 when I was actually thinking about that,

52:24.440 --> 52:27.280
 but I think part of it is...

52:27.280 --> 52:28.640
 I bet you never thought you're gonna have

52:28.640 --> 52:29.960
 to analyze your own tweets.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.040
 No, I didn't.

52:31.040 --> 52:35.120
 It's an interesting historical juxtaposition of thinking.

52:35.120 --> 52:37.920
 So the tweet is a historical...

52:37.920 --> 52:40.160
 You're doing an assembly experiment right now

52:40.160 --> 52:41.640
 because you're bringing a thought from the past

52:41.640 --> 52:43.240
 into the present and trying to actually...

52:43.240 --> 52:44.240
 Exactly, in the lab.

52:44.240 --> 52:45.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:45.080 --> 52:47.160
 This is experimental science right here

52:47.160 --> 52:48.840
 on the podcast live.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.760
 So go, let's see how the consciousness

52:52.760 --> 52:53.720
 evolves on this one.

52:53.720 --> 52:57.680
 Yeah, so in neuroscience, it's kind of accepted

52:57.680 --> 53:01.520
 that we can't get at the subjective aspect of consciousness.

53:01.520 --> 53:04.600
 So people are very interested in what would be

53:04.600 --> 53:06.120
 a correlate of consciousness.

53:06.120 --> 53:07.440
 So...

53:07.440 --> 53:09.560
 What's a correlate?

53:09.560 --> 53:13.960
 A correlate is a feature that relates to consciousness

53:13.960 --> 53:14.800
 activity.

53:14.800 --> 53:19.400
 For example, a verbal report is a correlate of consciousness

53:19.400 --> 53:22.920
 because I can tell you when I'm conscious.

53:22.920 --> 53:25.000
 And then when I'm sleeping, for example,

53:25.000 --> 53:26.200
 I can't tell you I'm conscious.

53:26.200 --> 53:28.680
 So we have this assumption that you're not conscious

53:28.680 --> 53:31.400
 when you're sleeping and you're conscious when you're awake.

53:31.400 --> 53:35.480
 And so that's sort of like a very obvious example,

53:35.480 --> 53:38.840
 but neuroscientists, which I'm no neuroscientist

53:38.840 --> 53:40.120
 and I'm not an expert in this field.

53:40.120 --> 53:44.120
 So they have very sophisticated ways of measuring activity

53:44.120 --> 53:47.600
 in our brain and trying to relate that to verbal report

53:47.600 --> 53:50.360
 and other proxies for whether someone is experiencing

53:50.360 --> 53:54.760
 something and that's what is meant by neural correlates.

53:54.760 --> 53:58.240
 And then so when people are trying to think about

53:59.800 --> 54:02.400
 studying consciousness or developing theories

54:02.400 --> 54:06.160
 for consciousness, they often are trying to build

54:06.160 --> 54:09.800
 an experimental bridge to these neural correlates,

54:09.800 --> 54:12.000
 recognizing the fact that a neural correlate

54:12.000 --> 54:15.120
 may or may not correspond to consciousness

54:15.120 --> 54:17.120
 because that problem's hard

54:17.120 --> 54:19.840
 and there's all these associated issues to it.

54:19.840 --> 54:22.160
 So that's from a neuroscience perspective,

54:22.160 --> 54:23.800
 it's like fake it till you make it.

54:23.800 --> 54:24.800
 Pretty much, yeah.

54:24.800 --> 54:26.480
 You fake whatever the correlates are

54:26.480 --> 54:31.200
 and hopefully that's going to summon

54:31.200 --> 54:32.640
 the thing that is consciousness.

54:32.640 --> 54:33.720
 Oh yeah, something like that.

54:33.720 --> 54:37.280
 And so the same thing on the chemical correlates of life.

54:38.640 --> 54:39.880
 That's an awesome concept.

54:39.880 --> 54:41.240
 Is that something that people?

54:41.240 --> 54:42.680
 No, I just made that up.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.000
 That was original to that tweet.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.640
 You can cite the tweet.

54:45.640 --> 54:48.320
 Maybe I'll write it in a paper someday.

54:48.320 --> 54:50.640
 Chemical correlates of life, that's a good title.

54:50.640 --> 54:52.960
 I mean, first of all, your papers, too,

54:52.960 --> 54:55.880
 that people should check out have great titles

54:55.880 --> 54:58.160
 or papers you're involved with.

54:58.160 --> 55:01.400
 So your tweets and titles are stellar

55:01.400 --> 55:02.640
 and also your ideas,

55:02.640 --> 55:04.960
 but the tweets and titles are much more important.

55:04.960 --> 55:06.000
 Of course.

55:06.000 --> 55:06.840
 So...

55:06.840 --> 55:08.680
 Ideas will live longer.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.040
 Yeah.

55:10.040 --> 55:12.240
 They're much more diffuse, though.

55:12.240 --> 55:15.320
 Well, yeah, the tweet is the Trojan horse

55:15.320 --> 55:18.040
 of the idea that sticks on for a long time.

55:18.040 --> 55:19.400
 Okay, so is there anything to say

55:19.400 --> 55:20.840
 about the chemical correlates of life?

55:20.840 --> 55:23.360
 You're saying there are similar kind

55:23.360 --> 55:25.680
 of ways of thinking about it,

55:25.680 --> 55:30.600
 but you mentioned about the communities.

55:30.600 --> 55:32.560
 Yeah, so I think in astrobiology,

55:32.560 --> 55:33.600
 it's not...

55:35.520 --> 55:37.760
 There's no concept of chemical correlates of life.

55:37.760 --> 55:38.960
 We don't think about it that way.

55:38.960 --> 55:41.920
 We think if we find molecules that are involved

55:41.920 --> 55:44.480
 in biology, we've found life.

55:44.480 --> 55:48.000
 So I think one of my motivations there

55:48.000 --> 55:49.200
 was just to separate the fact

55:49.200 --> 55:53.120
 that life has abstract properties associated to it.

55:53.120 --> 55:56.400
 They become imprinted in material substrates

55:57.320 --> 55:59.520
 and those substrates are correlates for that thing,

55:59.520 --> 56:01.160
 but they are not necessarily the thing

56:01.160 --> 56:02.000
 we're actually looking for.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
 The thing that we're looking for is the physics

56:04.000 --> 56:05.840
 that's organizing that system to begin with,

56:05.840 --> 56:07.280
 not the particular molecules.

56:07.280 --> 56:10.840
 In the same sense that your consciousness

56:10.840 --> 56:15.840
 is not your brain, it's instantiated in your brain.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.760
 It has to have a physical substrate,

56:18.760 --> 56:22.320
 but the matter is not the thing that you're looking at.

56:22.320 --> 56:24.320
 It's some other, at least not in the way

56:24.320 --> 56:27.040
 that we have come to look at matter,

56:27.040 --> 56:28.320
 with traditional physics and things.

56:28.320 --> 56:29.600
 There's something else there

56:29.600 --> 56:31.120
 and it might be this feature of history

56:31.120 --> 56:31.960
 I was talking about,

56:31.960 --> 56:35.880
 our time being actually physically represented there.

56:35.880 --> 56:38.640
 Do you think consciousness can be engineered?

56:38.640 --> 56:40.120
 Yes.

56:40.120 --> 56:41.440
 In the same way that life can be.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.440
 Wow, that was a fast answer.

56:42.440 --> 56:43.400
 I didn't even think about that.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.720
 That's interesting.

56:44.720 --> 56:46.320
 You don't have a free will.

56:46.320 --> 56:47.600
 No, I do have free will,

56:47.600 --> 56:48.440
 but it's interesting,

56:48.440 --> 56:50.960
 because I mean, you know.

56:50.960 --> 56:52.000
 Oh, you're backtracking.

56:52.000 --> 56:52.840
 No, no.

56:52.840 --> 56:53.680
 And that was predestined.

56:53.680 --> 56:55.760
 Yeah, no, no.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.000
 No, I do believe in free will,

56:57.000 --> 57:00.680
 but I also think that there's kind of an interesting,

57:00.680 --> 57:02.120
 you know, like what you're,

57:02.120 --> 57:03.280
 speaking about consciousness,

57:03.280 --> 57:04.600
 what are you consciously aware of

57:04.600 --> 57:07.600
 versus like, what is your subconscious brain

57:07.600 --> 57:09.200
 actually processing and doing?

57:09.200 --> 57:10.520
 And sometimes there's conflict

57:10.520 --> 57:13.120
 between your consciousness and your subconsciousness

57:13.120 --> 57:14.880
 or your consciousness is a little slower

57:14.880 --> 57:16.240
 than your subconscious.

57:16.240 --> 57:18.760
 And intuition is a really important feature of that.

57:18.760 --> 57:20.560
 And so a lot of the ways I do my science

57:20.560 --> 57:22.320
 is guided by intuition.

57:22.320 --> 57:23.880
 So when I give fast answers like that,

57:23.880 --> 57:24.720
 I think it's usually

57:24.720 --> 57:25.800
 because I haven't really thought about them

57:25.800 --> 57:29.080
 and therefore that's probably telling me something.

57:29.080 --> 57:31.640
 Let's continue the deep analysis of your tweets.

57:31.640 --> 57:35.880
 You said that determinism in a tweet,

57:35.880 --> 57:38.520
 determinism and randomness play important roles

57:38.520 --> 57:40.560
 in understanding what life is.

57:40.560 --> 57:42.520
 So let me ask on this topic of free will,

57:42.520 --> 57:44.000
 what is determinism?

57:44.000 --> 57:45.600
 What is randomness?

57:45.600 --> 57:48.200
 And why the heck do they have anything to do

57:48.200 --> 57:50.240
 with understanding life?

57:50.240 --> 57:51.240
 Yeah.

57:51.240 --> 57:52.560
 And you threw free will in there.

57:52.560 --> 57:54.880
 You just thrown all the stuff in the bag.

57:54.880 --> 57:55.920
 Are they not related?

57:55.920 --> 57:56.960
 No, no, they are.

57:56.960 --> 57:58.040
 They are related.

57:58.040 --> 57:59.120
 No, no, sorry.

57:59.120 --> 58:00.320
 I was being unfair.

58:00.320 --> 58:02.280
 You didn't even capitalize a tweet, by the way.

58:02.280 --> 58:03.520
 It was all lowercase.

58:03.520 --> 58:05.120
 I must have been angry.

58:05.120 --> 58:06.320
 Oh, that was, was that,

58:06.320 --> 58:08.160
 can you analyze the emotion behind that?

58:08.160 --> 58:09.000
 No, I actually, I.

58:09.000 --> 58:09.840
 Just frustration or hope?

58:09.840 --> 58:10.840
 Yeah, maybe.

58:10.840 --> 58:13.480
 So I already argued that I don't think

58:13.480 --> 58:16.080
 that can happen without that whole causal history.

58:16.080 --> 58:18.440
 And so I guess in some sense,

58:18.440 --> 58:20.720
 the determinism for me arises

58:20.720 --> 58:23.400
 because of the causal history.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.240
 And I'm not really sure actually

58:25.240 --> 58:28.960
 about whether the universe is random or deterministic.

58:28.960 --> 58:32.120
 I just had this sort of intuition for a long time.

58:32.120 --> 58:34.040
 I'm not sure if I agree with it anymore,

58:34.040 --> 58:35.360
 but it's still kind of lingering.

58:35.360 --> 58:37.200
 And I don't know what to do with this question.

58:37.200 --> 58:39.000
 But it seems to me, you know,

58:39.000 --> 58:41.400
 so there's, you asked the question, what is life?

58:41.400 --> 58:42.840
 But you could also, why life?

58:42.840 --> 58:43.680
 Why does life exist?

58:43.680 --> 58:45.600
 What does the universe need life for?

58:45.600 --> 58:46.800
 Not that the universe has needs,

58:46.800 --> 58:48.880
 but you know, we have to anthropocentrize things sometimes

58:48.880 --> 58:50.360
 to talk about them.

58:50.360 --> 58:53.840
 And I had this feeling that if it was possible

58:53.840 --> 58:57.240
 for a cup or a desk ornament or a phone on Mars

58:57.240 --> 58:59.560
 to spontaneously fluctuate into existence,

58:59.560 --> 59:01.800
 the universe didn't need life to create those objects.

59:01.800 --> 59:03.360
 It wasn't necessary for their existence.

59:03.360 --> 59:05.680
 It was just a random fluke event.

59:05.680 --> 59:09.160
 And so somehow to me, it seems that it can't be

59:09.160 --> 59:11.880
 that those things formed by random processes,

59:11.880 --> 59:14.200
 they actually have to have a set of causes

59:14.200 --> 59:17.320
 that accrue and form those things

59:17.320 --> 59:18.840
 and they have to have that history.

59:18.840 --> 59:23.440
 And so it seems to me that life was somehow deeply related

59:23.440 --> 59:26.000
 to the question of whether the underlying rules

59:26.000 --> 59:27.680
 of our universe had randomness in them

59:27.680 --> 59:29.120
 or they were fully deterministic.

59:29.120 --> 59:30.600
 And in some ways you can think about life

59:30.600 --> 59:33.920
 as being the most deterministic part of physics

59:33.920 --> 59:38.680
 because it's where the causes are precise in some sense.

59:39.680 --> 59:40.880
 Or more stable, so like.

59:40.880 --> 59:43.000
 Most stable, yes, most reliable.

59:43.000 --> 59:47.160
 Most reliable for our, for how we, for the tools of physics.

59:47.160 --> 59:50.720
 But what, where's the randomness come from then?

59:50.720 --> 59:54.480
 Okay, so you were speaking with.

59:54.480 --> 59:55.840
 I've gone in a tangent.

59:55.840 --> 59:57.480
 So I'm not sure where we are in the, yeah.

59:57.480 --> 1:00:00.880
 All of the universe is a kind of tangent.

1:00:00.880 --> 1:00:03.360
 So we're embracing the tangent.

1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:05.280
 So free will.

1:00:05.280 --> 1:00:06.120
 Yes.

1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:09.440
 You believe at this current time that you have free will.

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:11.160
 I believe my whole life I have free will.

1:00:11.160 --> 1:00:12.000
 What is illusion?

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:12.840
 Not just kidding.

1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:14.400
 I still believe it.

1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:15.240
 You still believe it.

1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:18.960
 So at the same time, you think that

1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:20.920
 in your conception of the universe,

1:00:20.920 --> 1:00:23.200
 causality seems to be pretty fundamental.

1:00:23.200 --> 1:00:24.040
 That's right.

1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:27.440
 It kind of wants the universe to be deterministic.

1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:31.280
 So how the heck do you think you have a free will

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.440
 and yet you value causality?

1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:39.840
 Because I depart from the conception of physics

1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:42.840
 that you can write down an initial condition

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:43.920
 and a fixed law of motion

1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:45.800
 and that will describe everything.

1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:47.200
 There's no incompatibility

1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:49.560
 if you are willing to reject that assertion.

1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:51.240
 So where's the randomness?

1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:54.240
 Where's the magic that gives birth to the free will?

1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:56.960
 Is it the randomness of the laws of physics?

1:00:56.960 --> 1:00:58.280
 No.

1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:00.160
 In my mind, what free will is,

1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:03.320
 is the fact that I as a physical system

1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:05.440
 have causal control over certain things.

1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:07.040
 I don't have causal control over everything,

1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:09.120
 but I have a certain set of things.

1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:12.160
 And I'm also, as I described,

1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:15.400
 sort of a nexus of a particular set of histories

1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:16.240
 that exist in the universe

1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:18.640
 and a particular set of futures that might exist.

1:01:18.640 --> 1:01:22.400
 And those futures that might exist are in part specified

1:01:22.400 --> 1:01:25.440
 by my physical configuration as me.

1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:29.560
 And therefore, it may not be free will

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:30.760
 in the traditional sense.

1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:31.960
 I don't even know what people mean

1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:33.000
 when they're talking about free will.

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.480
 Honestly, it's like the whole discussion is really muddled.

1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:38.360
 But in the sense that I am a causal agent,

1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:40.760
 if you wanna call it that, that exists in the universe.

1:01:40.760 --> 1:01:42.200
 And there are certain things that happen

1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:45.640
 because I exist as me, then yes, I have free will.

1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:50.080
 No, but do you, Sarah, have a choice

1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:51.640
 about what's going to happen next?

1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:53.440
 Oh, I see.

1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:56.120
 If the universe, could I have, if I run this?

1:01:56.120 --> 1:01:57.400
 Yes, I think so.

1:01:57.400 --> 1:01:58.600
 You have a choice.

1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:00.240
 Where's the choice come from?

1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:02.280
 I think that's related to the physics of consciousness.

1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:03.960
 So one of the things I didn't say about that,

1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:06.800
 and I don't know, maybe this is me just being hopeful

1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:08.640
 because maybe I just wanna have free will,

1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:10.840
 but I don't think that we can rule out the possibility

1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:13.040
 because I don't think that we understand enough

1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:14.440
 about any of these problems.

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.440
 But I think one of the things that's interesting for me

1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:18.880
 about the sort of inversion of the question

1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:21.080
 of consciousness that I proposed

1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:24.960
 is one of the features that we do

1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:27.040
 is we have imagination, right?

1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:29.480
 And people don't think about imagination as a physical thing,

1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:30.800
 but it is a physical thing.

1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:32.520
 It exists in the universe, right?

1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:34.840
 And so I'm like really intrigued by the fact

1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:38.240
 that say humans for another physical system

1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:39.800
 could do this too, it's not special to humans,

1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:44.240
 but for centuries imagined flying machines and rockets.

1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:45.760
 And then we finally built them, right?

1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:47.640
 So they were represented in our minds

1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:51.160
 and on the pages of things that we drew for hundreds of years

1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:54.040
 before we could build those physical objects in the universe.

1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:56.480
 But certainly the existence of rockets

1:02:56.480 --> 1:03:01.480
 is in part causally caused by the fact

1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:03.640
 that we could imagine them.

1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:07.920
 And so there seems to be this property

1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:09.880
 that some things don't exist.

1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:12.080
 They've never physically existed in the universe,

1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:14.680
 but we can imagine the possibility of them existing

1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:16.520
 and then cause them to exist,

1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:18.480
 maybe individually or collectively.

1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:21.000
 And I think that property is related

1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.200
 to what I would say about having choice or free will

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:24.920
 because that set of possibilities,

1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:27.360
 that thing, those set of things that you can imagine

1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:29.720
 is not constrained to your local physical environment

1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:30.560
 and history.

1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:32.000
 And this is what's a little bit different

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.440
 about intelligence as we see it in humans

1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:37.800
 and AI that we wanna build than biological intelligence

1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:40.680
 because biological intelligence is predicated completely

1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:42.520
 on the history of things that's seen in the past,

1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:45.400
 but something happened with the neural architectures

1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:48.000
 that evolved in multicellular organisms

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.400
 that they don't just have access to the past history

1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:52.400
 of their particular set of events,

1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:55.120
 but they can imagine things that haven't happened

1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:56.200
 on their timeline.

1:03:56.200 --> 1:03:58.080
 And as long as they're consistent with the laws of physics,

1:03:58.080 --> 1:03:59.600
 make them happen.

1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:02.520
 So this is fascinating.

1:04:02.520 --> 1:04:04.440
 It's trippy physics, but it exists.

1:04:04.440 --> 1:04:05.400
 So there you go.

1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:07.800
 I mean, in some sense, if you look at like

1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:11.960
 general relativity and gravity morphing space time,

1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:14.240
 in that same way, maybe whatever the physics

1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:17.400
 of consciousness might be, it might be morphing.

1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:18.800
 That's like what free will is.

1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:21.640
 It's morphing like the space,

1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:25.040
 just like ideas make rockets come to life.

1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:28.760
 It's somehow changing the space

1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:31.640
 of possible realizations of like whatever.

1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:33.400
 Yeah, okay.

1:04:33.400 --> 1:04:34.240
 But that's...

1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:35.560
 Life is kind of basically, if you wanna think about it,

1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:38.520
 like life is sort of changing the probability distributions

1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:39.360
 over what can exist.

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:40.880
 That's the physics of what life is.

1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:43.480
 And then consciousness is this sort of layered property

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:45.200
 or imagination on top of it

1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:47.280
 that kind of scrambles that a little bit more

1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:49.680
 and like has access to...

1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:51.800
 I don't know, it's kind of...

1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:53.080
 We don't know how to describe it, right?

1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:54.240
 Like that's why it's interesting, but...

1:04:54.240 --> 1:04:55.360
 But it's probabilistic.

1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:57.480
 So you do think like God plays dice.

1:04:57.480 --> 1:04:58.600
 So let me...

1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:00.560
 No, I think the description's probabilistic.

1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:05.160
 I don't necessarily think the underlying physics

1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:06.280
 is probabilistic.

1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:09.520
 I think the way that we can describe this physics

1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:12.240
 is going to be probabilistic and statistical,

1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:14.720
 but when we take measurements in the lab,

1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:15.960
 but the underlying physics itself

1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:17.080
 might still be deterministic.

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:19.520
 I don't know, maybe I'm...

1:05:19.520 --> 1:05:22.320
 It's hard to know what concepts to hold on to.

1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:24.760
 So I find myself constantly rejecting concepts,

1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:26.160
 but then I have to grab another one

1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:29.640
 and try to hold on to something from intellectual history.

1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:30.800
 Well, it's possible that our mind

1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:33.360
 is not able to hold the correct concepts in mind at all.

1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:36.080
 Like we're not able to even conceive of them correctly.

1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:38.960
 Maybe the words deterministic or random

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:42.360
 are not the right, even words conscious to be holding.

1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:46.360
 But maybe you can talk to the theory of everything,

1:05:46.360 --> 1:05:49.320
 this attempt in the current set of physical laws

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:50.880
 to try to unify them.

1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:55.280
 Is there any hope that once a theory of everything

1:05:55.280 --> 1:05:56.840
 is developed, and by theory of everything,

1:05:56.840 --> 1:06:00.240
 I mean in a narrow sense of unifying quantum field theory

1:06:00.240 --> 1:06:01.520
 and general relativity,

1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:04.320
 do you think that will contain some...

1:06:05.960 --> 1:06:08.440
 Like in order to do that unification,

1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:10.760
 you would have to get something

1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:13.280
 that would then give hints about the physics of life,

1:06:13.280 --> 1:06:15.880
 physics of existence, physics of consciousness.

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:18.160
 Yeah, I used to not,

1:06:18.160 --> 1:06:21.120
 but I actually, I have become increasingly convinced

1:06:21.120 --> 1:06:23.880
 that it probably will.

1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:25.960
 And part of the reason is,

1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:27.600
 I think I've talked a little bit already

1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:29.280
 about these holes in physics,

1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:32.840
 like the theories we have in physics,

1:06:32.840 --> 1:06:35.360
 they have problems, they have lots of problems,

1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:37.120
 and they're very deep problems,

1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:39.040
 and we don't know how to patch them.

1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:41.200
 And some of those problems become very evident

1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:43.440
 when you try to patch quantum mechanics

1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:45.640
 and general relativity together.

1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:47.520
 So there is this kind of interesting feature

1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:49.840
 that some of the ways of patching that

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:54.200
 might actually closely resemble the physics of life.

1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:56.520
 And so the place where that actually comes up most,

1:06:56.520 --> 1:06:58.120
 and actually we just had a workshop

1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:00.600
 in the Beyond Center where I work at Arizona State University,

1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:02.760
 and Lee Smolin made this point that he thinks

1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:04.360
 that the theory of quantum gravity,

1:07:04.360 --> 1:07:06.000
 when we solve it, is gonna be the same theory

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.520
 that gives rise to life.

1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:11.440
 And I think that I agree with him on some levels

1:07:11.440 --> 1:07:12.920
 because there's something very interesting

1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:16.160
 where if you look at these sort of causal set theories

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:18.680
 of gravity, where they're looking for space

1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:23.600
 as being emergent, and so space time is an emergent concept

1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:26.160
 from a causal set, which is also sort of related,

1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:29.200
 I think, to what Wolfram's doing with his physics project,

1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:30.800
 it's the same kind of underlying math

1:07:30.800 --> 1:07:32.040
 that we have in this theory

1:07:32.040 --> 1:07:33.640
 that we've been developing related to life

1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:37.440
 called assembly theory, which is basically trying

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:40.880
 to look at complex objects like molecules

1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:45.880
 and bacteria and living things as basically being assembled

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:52.280
 from a set of component parts,

1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:54.640
 and that they actually encode all the possible histories

1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:56.640
 that they could have in that physical object.

1:07:56.640 --> 1:07:59.480
 So mathematically, all these ideas, I think, are related.

1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:00.680
 I think a lot of people are thinking about this

1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:03.880
 from different perspectives, and then constructor theory

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:05.960
 that David Deutch and Karen Merledo have been developing

1:08:05.960 --> 1:08:07.560
 is a totally different angle on it,

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:09.120
 but I think getting at some similar ideas,

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:11.200
 so it's a really interesting time right now, I think,

1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:13.680
 for the frontiers of physics and how it's relating

1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:15.920
 to maybe deeper principles about what life is.

1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:19.200
 So short answer, yes, long winded answer, rewind.

1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:22.760
 Can we talk about aliens?

1:08:22.760 --> 1:08:23.600
 Any time.

1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:28.600
 So one, I think one interesting way to sneak up

1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:33.240
 on the question of what is life is to ask,

1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:36.140
 what should we look for in alien life?

1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:40.680
 You know, if we were to look out into our galaxy

1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:44.320
 and into the universe and come up with a framework

1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:49.320
 of how to detect alien life, what should we be looking for?

1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:54.320
 Is there like set of rules, like it's both the tools

1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:58.720
 and the tools that serve the senses

1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:01.400
 for certain kind of properties of life.

1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:05.120
 So what should we look for in alien life?

1:09:05.120 --> 1:09:07.760
 Yeah, so we have a paper actually coming out on Monday,

1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:09.360
 which is collaboration.

1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:11.400
 It's actually really Lee Cronin's lab,

1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:12.680
 but my group worked with him on it

1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:13.600
 and we're working on the theory,

1:09:13.600 --> 1:09:17.800
 which is this idea that we should look for life

1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:20.360
 as high assembly objects.

1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:22.400
 What we mean by that is,

1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:24.440
 which is actually observationally measurable.

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:25.400
 And this is one of the reasons

1:09:25.400 --> 1:09:27.200
 that I started working with Lee on these ideas

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:30.000
 is because being a theorist, it's easy to work in a vacuum.

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.600
 It's very hard to connect abstract ideas

1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:33.720
 about the nature of life

1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:35.800
 to anything that's experimentally tractable.

1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:39.520
 But what his lab has been able to do

1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:43.200
 is develop this method where they look at a molecule

1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:46.240
 and they break it apart into all its component parts.

1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:48.480
 And so you say you have some elementary building blocks

1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:49.920
 and you can build up all the ways

1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:52.760
 of putting those together to make the original object.

1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:55.320
 And then you look for the shortest path in that space

1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:59.160
 and you say that's sort of the assembly number

1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:00.960
 associated to that object.

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:02.920
 And if that number is higher,

1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:05.920
 it assumes that a longer causal history

1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:07.560
 is necessary to produce that object

1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:09.680
 or more information is necessary to specify

1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:11.520
 the creation of that object in the universe.

1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:14.240
 Now that kind of idea at a superficial level

1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:15.880
 has existed for a long time.

1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:19.280
 That kind of idea as a physical observable of molecules

1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:20.840
 is completely novel.

1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:22.880
 And what his lab has been able to show

1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:24.560
 is that if you look at a bunch of samples

1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:26.840
 of nonbiological things and biological things,

1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:31.400
 there's this kind of threshold of assembly

1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:34.960
 where as far as the experimental evidence is

1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:38.120
 and also your intuition would suggest

1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:41.240
 that nonbiological systems don't produce things

1:10:41.240 --> 1:10:43.240
 with high assembly number.

1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:44.760
 So this goes back to the idea

1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:46.640
 like a protein's not gonna spontaneously

1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:48.760
 fluctuate into existence on the surface of Mars.

1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:50.200
 It requires an evolutionary process

1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:52.720
 and a biological architecture to produce a protein.

1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:54.560
 You generalize that argument,

1:10:54.560 --> 1:10:58.880
 a complex molecule or a cup or a desk ornament

1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:02.040
 in this sort of abstract idea of assembly spaces

1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:04.640
 as being the causal history of objects.

1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:06.320
 And you can talk about the shortest path

1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:08.520
 from elementary objects to an object

1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:11.040
 given an elementary set of operations.

1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:14.280
 And you can experimentally measure that with a mass spec.

1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:16.680
 And that's basically sort of the idea.

1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:17.680
 That's really fascinating.

1:11:17.680 --> 1:11:19.080
 I can't get out of my head.

1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:20.800
 I'd start imagining Legos.

1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:23.360
 And all the Legos I've ever built and how many steps,

1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:28.360
 what is the shortest path to the final little Lego castles?

1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:31.160
 So yeah, so then like asking about going to look

1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:34.560
 for alien life, the idea is most the instruments

1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:36.200
 that NASA builds, for example,

1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:38.600
 or any of the space agencies looking for life in the universe

1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:42.000
 are looking for chemical correlates of life, right?

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.960
 But here we have something that is based

1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:46.280
 on properties of molecules.

1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:47.840
 It's not a chemical correlate.

1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:49.120
 It's agnostic.

1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:50.520
 It doesn't care about the molecule.

1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:54.240
 It cares about what is the history necessary

1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:56.320
 to produce this molecule?

1:11:56.320 --> 1:11:58.760
 How complex is it in terms of how much time is needing,

1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:00.840
 how much information is required to produce it?

1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:04.200
 So when you observe a thing on another planet,

1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:08.520
 you're essentially, the process looks like reverse engineering,

1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:10.480
 trying to figure out what is the shortest path

1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:11.600
 to create that thing?

1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:13.000
 Yeah, so most, yeah.

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:16.720
 And I would say most examples of biology or technology

1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:18.120
 don't take the shortest path, right?

1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:20.160
 But the shortest path is a bound on how hard it is

1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:21.680
 for the universe to make that.

1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:25.120
 Yeah, and I guess you and Lee are saying

1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:28.360
 that there's a heuristic, that's a good metric

1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:31.640
 for like better perhaps than chemical correlates.

1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:35.280
 Yes, because it's not contingent on looking

1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:38.960
 for the chemistry of life on Earth, on other planets.

1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:42.000
 And it also has a deeper explanatory framework

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.640
 associated to it as far as the kind of theory

1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:47.240
 that we're trying to develop associated to what life is.

1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:49.840
 And I think this is one of the problems I have in my field

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:53.160
 personally in astrobiology is people observe something

1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:56.120
 on Earth, say oxygen in the atmosphere

1:12:56.120 --> 1:12:58.440
 or an amino acid in a cell.

1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:02.240
 And then they say, let's go look for that on another planet.

1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:04.040
 Let's look for oxygen on exoplanets

1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:06.280
 or let's look for amino acids on Mars.

1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:12.480
 And then they assume that's a way of looking for life or even

1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:13.480
 phosphine on Venus.

1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:17.120
 But there's all these examples of let's look for one molecule.

1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:18.400
 A molecule is not life.

1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:21.800
 Life is a system that patterns particular structures

1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:23.160
 into matter.

1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:24.320
 That's what it is.

1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:26.720
 And it doesn't care what molecules are there.

1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:29.120
 It's something about the patterns and that structure

1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:31.120
 and that history.

1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:33.200
 And if you're looking for a molecule,

1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:35.240
 you're not testing any hypotheses about the nature

1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:36.160
 of what life is.

1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:39.000
 It doesn't tell me anything if we discover oxygen on exoplanet

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.040
 about what kind of life is there, just oxygen on exoplanet.

1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:44.040
 It's not there.

1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:46.680
 I guess I think when you think about the question,

1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:47.800
 are we alone in the universe?

1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:49.520
 That's a pretty frickin deep question.

1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:51.040
 It should have a frickin deep answer.

1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:53.000
 It shouldn't just be there's a molecule on an exoplanet.

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.360
 Wow, we solved the problem.

1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:56.680
 It should tell us something meaningful about our existence.

1:13:56.680 --> 1:13:59.000
 And I feel like we've fallen short

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.680
 on how we're searching for life in terms of actually searching

1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:08.320
 for things like us in this kind of deeper way.

1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:10.720
 But how do you do that initial kind of say,

1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:12.520
 I'm walking down the street and I'm

1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:15.760
 looking for that double take test of like,

1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:17.200
 what the hell is that?

1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:20.560
 Like that initial, like how do we

1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:24.200
 look for the possibility of weirdness,

1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:27.200
 the possibility of high assembly number?

1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:31.800
 What would aliens look like if they don't have two eyes

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:32.760
 and are green?

1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:33.880
 It's fine with you.

1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:35.520
 I wouldn't probably always solve the problem.

1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:36.000
 Right.

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.600
 There's another Nobel Prize in there somewhere.

1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:39.880
 Yeah, somewhere in there.

1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:43.160
 Well, I think it's kind of, so there is a bias here, right?

1:14:43.160 --> 1:14:45.920
 So we've evolved to recognize life on Earth, right?

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:48.600
 Like children at a very early age

1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:50.680
 can tell the difference between a puppy and a plant,

1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:53.760
 and then the plant and a chair, for example.

1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:56.080
 Like it seems innate.

1:14:56.080 --> 1:15:00.720
 And so I think, and also because we're life,

1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:02.560
 I think there's this implicit bias

1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:03.960
 that we should know it when we see it,

1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:06.760
 and it should be completely obvious to us.

1:15:06.760 --> 1:15:08.920
 But there are a lot of features of our universe

1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:10.360
 that are not completely obvious to us,

1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:12.360
 like the fact that this table is made of atoms

1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:15.120
 and that I'm sitting in a gravitational potential well

1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:16.520
 right now.

1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:19.480
 And I guess my point with this is,

1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:23.600
 I think life is much less obvious than we think it is.

1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:27.080
 And so it could be in many more forms than we think it is.

1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:29.960
 And I guess let's go back to the point about being open minded

1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:33.000
 that we may not know what alien life looks like.

1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.440
 It might not even be possible to interact with alien life,

1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:39.880
 because maybe something about our informational lineage,

1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:42.880
 it makes it impossible for information from an alien

1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:43.840
 to be copied to us.

1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:47.760
 Therefore, there's no, so to speak, communication channel.

1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:49.800
 And I don't mean verbal communication.

1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:52.960
 Just it's not in our observational space.

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:56.200
 Like there's fundamental questions

1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:58.320
 about why we observe the universe in position rather

1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:01.360
 than momentum, but we also observe it

1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:03.560
 in terms of certain informational patterns and things.

1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:04.920
 Like that's what our brain constructs.

1:16:04.920 --> 1:16:07.800
 And maybe aliens just interact with a different part

1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:08.600
 of reality than we do.

1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:09.840
 That's wildly speculative.

1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:14.040
 But I think it's possible and I think it's consistent

1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:15.080
 with the physics.

1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:17.120
 So I think the best ways we can ask questions

1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:20.520
 are about life and chemistry and asking questions

1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:23.280
 about if information is a real physical thing,

1:16:23.280 --> 1:16:26.840
 what would its signatures be in matter?

1:16:26.840 --> 1:16:28.920
 And how do we recognize those?

1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:31.520
 And I think the ones that are most obvious

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:33.040
 are the ones I've already articulated.

1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:35.640
 You have these objects that seem completely improbable

1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:37.800
 for the universe to produce because the universe doesn't

1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:40.960
 have the design of that object in the laws.

1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:44.440
 So therefore, an object had to evolve.

1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:47.760
 We call it evolution, but it had to be produced

1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:51.320
 by the universe that then had all of the possible tasks

1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:54.640
 to make that object specified.

1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:57.680
 I mean, there's some like, there's an engineering question

1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:01.000
 here of are there sensors we can create

1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:05.680
 that can help us discover certain pockets

1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:08.400
 of high assembly aliens?

1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:13.400
 Like, I mean, there is a hope setting dogs and chairs

1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:14.600
 aside.

1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:19.440
 There's a hope that visually and we could detect.

1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:23.640
 Like, because our universe, I mean, at least the way

1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:26.120
 we look at it now, like this three dimensional space

1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:29.400
 time, we can visually comprehend it,

1:17:29.400 --> 1:17:32.760
 it's interesting to think like, if we got to hang out,

1:17:32.760 --> 1:17:35.920
 you know, if there's an alien in this room,

1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:37.760
 like, would we be able to detect it

1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:39.480
 with our current sensors?

1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:41.760
 Not the fancy kinds, but like webcams.

1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:43.320
 Like, say standing over there?

1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:44.440
 Yeah, standing over there.

1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:46.000
 Or maybe like in this carpet, see,

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:47.520
 there's all these kinds of patterns, right?

1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:48.520
 Yeah.

1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:52.880
 I don't know if this carpet is an alien.

1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:56.200
 Well, so I see what you're saying.

1:17:56.200 --> 1:17:57.840
 So assembly theory is pretty general.

1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:00.040
 Like, I mean, we've been applying it to molecules

1:18:00.040 --> 1:18:02.160
 because it makes sense to apply it to molecules,

1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:06.200
 but it's supposed to explain life, you know,

1:18:06.200 --> 1:18:07.200
 like the physics of life.

1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:09.320
 So it should explain, you know, the things in this room

1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:11.280
 in addition to molecules.

1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:14.600
 So I guess, and you can apply it to images and things.

1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:18.600
 So I guess the idea, you know, you could explore

1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:21.320
 is just looking at everything on planet Earth

1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:23.200
 in terms of its assembly structure

1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:24.960
 and then looking for things

1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:27.080
 that aren't part of our biological lineage.

1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:29.440
 If they have high assembly, they might be aliens on Earth.

1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:31.320
 I mean, that is a very kind of rigorous

1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:32.320
 computer vision question.

1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:36.400
 Can we visually, is there a strong correlation

1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:38.600
 between certain kind of high assembly objects

1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:42.120
 when they get to the scale where they're visually observable

1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:47.120
 and some, like when it's, say, projected onto a 2D plane,

1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:49.760
 can we figure out something?

1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:51.520
 I'm glad you brought up a computer vision point

1:18:51.520 --> 1:18:53.600
 because for a while I had this kind of thought in my mind

1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:55.240
 that we can't even see ourselves clearly.

1:18:55.240 --> 1:18:56.560
 So one of the things, you know,

1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:58.000
 people are worried about artificial intelligence

1:18:58.000 --> 1:18:59.920
 for a lot of reasons, but I think it's really fascinating

1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:03.360
 because it's like the first time in history

1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:04.480
 that we're building a system

1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:06.400
 that can help us understand ourselves.

1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:08.600
 So like, you know, people talk about AI physics,

1:19:08.600 --> 1:19:12.560
 but like, you know, when I look at another person,

1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:15.440
 I don't see them as a four billion year lineage,

1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:16.400
 but that's what they are.

1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:18.200
 And so is everything here, right?

1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:21.480
 So imagine that we build artificial systems

1:19:21.480 --> 1:19:24.320
 that could actually see that feature of us.

1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:25.680
 What else would they see?

1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:28.720
 And I think that's what you're asking.

1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:31.960
 And I think that would be so cool.

1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:35.400
 I want that to happen,

1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:38.600
 but I think we're a little ways off from it, but yeah.

1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:40.240
 We're going there, I hope.

1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:43.440
 Okay, let me ask you, I apologize ahead of time,

1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:45.200
 but let me ask you the internet question.

1:19:45.200 --> 1:19:47.600
 So you're a physicist, you ask rigorous questions

1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:49.680
 about the physics of existence

1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:52.920
 and these models of high assembly objects.

1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:55.240
 Now, when the internet would see an alien,

1:19:55.240 --> 1:19:56.480
 they would ask two questions.

1:19:56.480 --> 1:19:58.160
 One, can I eat it?

1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:00.040
 And two, can I have sex with it?

1:20:00.040 --> 1:20:00.880
 Yes.

1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:01.720
 So.

1:20:01.720 --> 1:20:05.280
 All the existential questions, those are very important.

1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:07.240
 The internet is very sophisticated.

1:20:07.240 --> 1:20:08.080
 It really is.

1:20:08.080 --> 1:20:10.640
 It's got in our basal cognition pretty good.

1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:12.640
 So you kind of mentioned that it's very difficult.

1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:14.440
 It's possible that we may not be

1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:16.160
 even able to communicate with it.

1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:17.000
 Right.

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:18.600
 But the internet has more hope than we do.

1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:20.080
 Yeah, it's a hopeful place.

1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:20.920
 Yes.

1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:23.760
 Do you think in terms of like interacting

1:20:23.760 --> 1:20:27.800
 on this very primal level of sharing resources,

1:20:27.800 --> 1:20:28.920
 like what would aliens eat?

1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:29.920
 What would we eat?

1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:31.480
 Would we eat the same thing?

1:20:31.480 --> 1:20:33.760
 Could we potentially eat each other?

1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:37.360
 One person eats the other or the aliens eat us?

1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:40.720
 And the same thing with not sex in general reproduction,

1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:42.400
 but genetically mixing stuff.

1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:46.640
 Like would we be able to mix genetic information?

1:20:46.640 --> 1:20:48.800
 Maybe not genetic, but maybe information, right?

1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:50.560
 And I think part of your question is like,

1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:54.280
 so if you think of life as like this history

1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:55.640
 of events that happen in the universe,

1:20:55.640 --> 1:20:57.040
 like there's this question of like,

1:20:57.040 --> 1:20:59.400
 how divergent are those histories, right?

1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:01.000
 So when we get to the scale of technology,

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:03.000
 it's possible to imagine,

1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.600
 imagine, although we can't even do it,

1:21:04.600 --> 1:21:06.240
 like imagine all the possible technologies

1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:07.360
 that could exist in the universe.

1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:09.120
 But if you think about all the possible chemistries,

1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:11.360
 somehow that seems like a lower dimensional space

1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:13.240
 and a lower set of possibilities.

1:21:13.240 --> 1:21:16.360
 So it might be that like when we interact with aliens,

1:21:16.360 --> 1:21:19.600
 we do have to go back to those more basal levels

1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:23.200
 to figure out sort of what the map is, right?

1:21:23.200 --> 1:21:26.280
 Like the sort of where we have a common history.

1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:29.320
 We must have a common history somewhere in the universe,

1:21:29.320 --> 1:21:31.880
 but in order to be able to actually interact

1:21:31.880 --> 1:21:34.040
 in a meaningful way, you have to have some shared history.

1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:36.080
 I mean, the reason we can exchange genetic information

1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:39.560
 in each other's food or eat each other as food

1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:41.200
 is because we have a shared history.

1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:43.200
 So we have to find that shared history.

1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:44.720
 We have to find the common ancestor

1:21:44.720 --> 1:21:47.040
 and this causality map, the causality tree.

1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:48.080
 Something, yes, yes.

1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:50.080
 And we have a last universal common ancestor

1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:52.320
 for all life on earth, which I think is sort of the nexus

1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:54.560
 of that causality map for life on earth.

1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:58.160
 But the question is, where would other aliens diverge

1:21:58.160 --> 1:21:59.000
 on that map?

1:21:59.000 --> 1:21:59.840
 That's really interesting.

1:22:01.760 --> 1:22:04.840
 So say there's a lot of aliens out there in the universe,

1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:08.680
 each set of organisms will probably have like a number,

1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:13.280
 you know, like Erdos number of like how far,

1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:16.040
 like how far our common ancestor is.

1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:19.680
 And so the closer the common ancestor, like it is on earth,

1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:22.360
 the more likely we are to be able

1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:24.200
 to have sexual reproduction.

1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:25.520
 Well, it's like sort of like humans having

1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:27.240
 common culture and languages, right?

1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:28.080
 Yeah, exactly.

1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:30.200
 Language, communication.

1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:32.400
 It might take a lot of work though with an alien

1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:35.640
 because you really have to get over a language barrier.

1:22:35.640 --> 1:22:36.640
 Oh boy.

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:40.120
 So it's communication, it's resources.

1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:44.800
 I mean, it's all the whole, and I think tied

1:22:44.800 --> 1:22:48.240
 into that is the questions of like who's going to harm who.

1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:49.080
 Right.

1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:49.920
 And actually definitions of harm.

1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:50.960
 And whether your parents approve,

1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:52.840
 you know, all those kind of questions.

1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:54.640
 Whether the common ancestor approves.

1:22:54.640 --> 1:22:56.280
 Yeah, this is very true.

1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:01.760
 How many alien civilizations do you think are out there?

1:23:01.760 --> 1:23:03.960
 I don't have intuition for that,

1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:07.480
 which I have always thought was deeply intriguing.

1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:11.480
 So, and part of this, I mean, I say it specifically

1:23:11.480 --> 1:23:12.760
 as I don't have intuition for that

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:14.200
 because it's like one of those questions

1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:15.520
 that you feel around for a while

1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:19.400
 and you really just, you can't see it,

1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:20.920
 even though it might be right there.

1:23:20.920 --> 1:23:24.240
 And in that sense, it's a little like

1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:25.880
 the quantum to classical transition.

1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:27.160
 You're like really talking about two different

1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:28.040
 kinds of physics.

1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:29.400
 And I think that's kind of part of the problem

1:23:29.400 --> 1:23:30.400
 once we understand the physics,

1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:33.080
 that question might become more meaningful.

1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:34.800
 But there's also this other issue,

1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:38.360
 and this was really instilled on me by my mentor,

1:23:38.360 --> 1:23:39.760
 Paul Davies, when I was a postdoc,

1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:41.920
 because he always talks about how,

1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:44.160
 you know, whether aliens are common or rare

1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:47.240
 is kind of just, you know, it's like,

1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:49.280
 you know, it follows a wave of popularity

1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:51.120
 and it just depends on like the mood of,

1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:53.240
 you know, what the culture is at the time.

1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:54.760
 And I always thought that was kind of an intriguing

1:23:54.760 --> 1:23:56.960
 observation, but also there's this,

1:23:56.960 --> 1:23:58.440
 you know, a set of points about,

1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:00.000
 if you go by the observational evidence,

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.200
 which we're supposed to do with scientists, right?

1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:07.200
 You know, we have evidence of us

1:24:08.680 --> 1:24:11.600
 and one original life event from which we emerged.

1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:13.120
 And people want to make arguments

1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:15.760
 that because that event was rapid,

1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:17.280
 or because there's other planets

1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:18.760
 that have properties similar to ours

1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:20.440
 that that event should be common.

1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:22.080
 But you actually can't reason on that

1:24:22.080 --> 1:24:23.760
 because our existence observing that event

1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:25.760
 is contingent on that event happening,

1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:27.840
 which means it could have been completely improbable

1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:29.360
 or very common.

1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:31.840
 And Brandon Carter like clearly articulated that

1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:35.480
 in terms of anthropic arguments a few decades ago.

1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:38.000
 So there is this kind of issue

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:39.880
 that we have to contend with dealing with life

1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:42.000
 that's closer to home than we have to deal with

1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.680
 with any other problems in physics,

1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:45.840
 which we're talking about the physics of ourselves.

1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:47.720
 And when you're asking about the original life event,

1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:49.000
 that event happening in the universe,

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.640
 at least as like our existence is contingent on it.

1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:55.840
 And so you can think about sort of fine tuning arguments

1:24:55.840 --> 1:24:56.680
 that way too.

1:24:56.680 --> 1:25:00.040
 But the sort of otter part of it is like,

1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:03.240
 when I think about how likely it is,

1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:06.360
 I think it's because we don't understand this mechanism yet

1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:10.840
 about how information can be generated spontaneously.

1:25:10.840 --> 1:25:13.840
 That I like, cause I can't see that physics clearly yet,

1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:15.760
 even though I have a lot of, you know,

1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:18.720
 like some things around the space of it in my mind,

1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:22.520
 I can't articulate how likely that process is.

1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:24.200
 So my honest answer is, I don't know,

1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:25.960
 and it sometimes feels like a cop out,

1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:27.400
 but I feel like that's a more honest answer

1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:29.840
 and a more meaningful way of making progress

1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:31.880
 than what a lot of people want to do,

1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:34.440
 which is say, oh, well, we have a one in 10 chance

1:25:34.440 --> 1:25:36.520
 of having on an exoplanet with Earth like properties

1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:38.800
 because there's lots of Earth like planets out there

1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:40.360
 and life happened fast on Earth.

1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:43.000
 Well, so kind of a follow up question,

1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:46.680
 but as a side comment, what I really am enjoying

1:25:46.680 --> 1:25:48.800
 about the way you're talking about human beings

1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:51.280
 is you always say, and not to make yourself conscious

1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:53.080
 about it, cause I really, really enjoy it.

1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:54.520
 Do you say we?

1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:57.360
 Yes. You don't say humans.

1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:00.200
 You say, cause oftentimes like, you know,

1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:01.760
 I don't know, evolutionary biologists

1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:05.400
 will kind of put yourself out as an observer,

1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:08.240
 but you're, it's kind of fascinating to think

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:09.520
 that you as a human are struggling

1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:11.040
 about your own origins.

1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:12.720
 Yes, that's the problem.

1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:17.160
 And yeah, and I think, I don't do that deliberately,

1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:18.440
 but I do think that way.

1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:20.840
 And this is sort of the inversion from the logic of physics

1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:23.520
 because physics as it's always been constructed

1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:26.400
 has treated us as external observers of the universe.

1:26:26.400 --> 1:26:27.680
 And we are not part of the universe.

1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:29.640
 And this is why the problem of life, I think,

1:26:29.640 --> 1:26:31.320
 demands completely new thinking

1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:33.600
 because we have to think about ourselves

1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:35.600
 as minds that exist in the universe

1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:37.800
 and are at this particular moment in history

1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:39.680
 and looking out at the things around us

1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:42.720
 and trying to understand what we are inside the system,

1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:43.840
 not outside the system.

1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:46.800
 We don't have descriptions at a fundamental level

1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:48.840
 that describe us as inside the system.

1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:51.280
 And this was my problem with cellular automata also.

1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:54.200
 You're always an external observer for a cellular automata.

1:26:54.200 --> 1:26:55.280
 You're not in the system.

1:26:55.280 --> 1:26:58.880
 What does the cellular automata look like from the inside?

1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:00.880
 I think you just broke my brain with that question.

1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:01.880
 Exactly, but that's the problem.

1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:03.080
 I thought about that for a long time.

1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:08.960
 But I'm going to, yeah, that's a really clean formulation

1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:12.360
 of a very fundamental question because you can only,

1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:16.520
 to understand cellular automata, you have to be inside of it.

1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:20.880
 But as a human, sort of a poetic, romantic question,

1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:25.480
 does it make you sad, does it make you hopeful

1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:27.360
 whether we're alone or not?

1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:31.080
 Like in the different possible versions of that,

1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:36.160
 if we're the highest assembly object in the entire universe,

1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:37.000
 does that give you...

1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.160
 At this moment in time, maybe.

1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:39.880
 At this moment in the causal chain.

1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:41.880
 Because we make, I assume we have a future.

1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:43.480
 Well, we definitely have a future.

1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:47.920
 The question is where that future decreases the assembly.

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:50.480
 Like it could be we're at the peak

1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:52.840
 or we could be just...

1:27:52.840 --> 1:27:55.800
 That would be inconsistent with the physics in my mind.

1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:59.120
 But so I should give a caveat.

1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:01.520
 I've given the caveat that I'm biased as a physicist,

1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:03.520
 but I'm also biased as an eternal optimist.

1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:06.520
 So pretty much all of my modes of operation

1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:08.120
 for building theories about the world

1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:10.160
 are not like an Occam's razor,

1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:11.640
 what's the simplest explanation,

1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:14.720
 but what's the most optimistic explanation?

1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:16.240
 And part of the reason for that

1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:20.720
 is if you really think explanations have causal power

1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:23.120
 in the sense that the fact that we have theories

1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:24.920
 about the world has enabled technologies

1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:27.520
 and physically transformed the world around us,

1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:28.920
 I think I have to take seriously

1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:31.360
 that as a part of the physics I wanna describe

1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:35.840
 and try to build theories of reality

1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:37.800
 that are optimistic about what's coming next

1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:39.600
 because the theories are in part the causes

1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:40.600
 of what comes next.

1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:45.000
 So there could be a physics of hope

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:46.920
 or a physics of optimism in there too.

1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:48.040
 Yes.

1:28:48.040 --> 1:28:51.120
 Is that seems like also, I mean,

1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:53.960
 optimism does seem to be a kind of engine

1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:56.240
 that results in innovation.

1:28:56.240 --> 1:28:57.080
 Yes.

1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:59.680
 So this is dry, like why the hell

1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:02.080
 are we trying to come up with new stuff?

1:29:02.080 --> 1:29:04.880
 Oh, so I made this point about thinking life

1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:06.160
 is the physics of existence

1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:07.800
 and it's not just the physics of existence,

1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:11.400
 it's the physics of more things existing.

1:29:11.400 --> 1:29:12.760
 So I think one of these drives of like...

1:29:12.760 --> 1:29:13.600
 Creativity.

1:29:13.600 --> 1:29:14.600
 Yeah, creativity.

1:29:14.600 --> 1:29:16.360
 Like optimism, the story.

1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:18.680
 So if you like, people like entropy,

1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:21.400
 I don't like entropy as it was formulated in the 1800s.

1:29:21.400 --> 1:29:22.800
 I think it's an antiquated concept,

1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:27.640
 but this idea of maximizing over the possible number

1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:28.920
 of states that could exist.

1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:31.120
 Imagine the universe is actually trying to maximize

1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:33.400
 over the number of things that could physically exist.

1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:34.720
 What would be the best way to do that?

1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:35.640
 The best way to do that would be

1:29:35.640 --> 1:29:37.800
 evolve intelligent technological things

1:29:37.800 --> 1:29:39.400
 that could explore that space.

1:29:41.800 --> 1:29:43.880
 It's okay, that's talking about alien life

1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:45.240
 out there in the universe.

1:29:45.240 --> 1:29:47.000
 But you've also earlier in the conversation

1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:50.200
 mentioned the shadow biosphere.

1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:55.200
 So is it possible that we have weird life here on earth

1:29:56.320 --> 1:29:58.440
 that we're just not...

1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:02.200
 Like even in a high assembly formulation of life,

1:30:02.200 --> 1:30:07.040
 that we're just not paying attention to, we're blind to.

1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:09.480
 Like life we're potentially able to detect

1:30:09.480 --> 1:30:10.520
 but we're blind to.

1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:12.360
 And maybe you could say, what is the shadow biosphere?

1:30:12.360 --> 1:30:13.320
 Sure, sure.

1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:15.160
 Yeah, the shadow biosphere is this idea

1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:17.960
 that there might have been other original life events

1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:21.000
 that happened on earth that were independent

1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:24.040
 from the original life event that led to us

1:30:24.040 --> 1:30:26.360
 and all of the life that we know on earth.

1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:29.360
 And therefore there could be aliens

1:30:29.360 --> 1:30:32.120
 in the sense they have a different origin event

1:30:32.120 --> 1:30:33.280
 living among us.

1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:37.120
 And it was proposed by a number of people,

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:39.920
 but one of them was Paul Davies

1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:41.160
 that I mentioned earlier as my mentor.

1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:42.920
 And he has a really cute way of saying

1:30:42.920 --> 1:30:44.720
 that aliens could be right under our noses

1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:49.440
 or even in our noses with a British accent,

1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:50.280
 it sounds better.

1:30:50.280 --> 1:30:53.720
 But anyway, so the idea is like,

1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:56.400
 it could literally be anywhere around us.

1:30:56.400 --> 1:30:58.200
 And if you think actually about the discovery

1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:00.200
 of like viruses and bacteria,

1:31:00.200 --> 1:31:02.320
 for a long time they were kind of a shadow biosphere.

1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:06.040
 It was life that was around us, but invisible.

1:31:08.320 --> 1:31:09.760
 But this takes it a little bit further

1:31:09.760 --> 1:31:11.960
 and saying that all of those examples,

1:31:11.960 --> 1:31:14.040
 viruses, bacteria, and everything that we've discovered

1:31:14.040 --> 1:31:16.120
 so far has this common ancestry

1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:18.520
 in the last universal common ancestor of life on earth.

1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:20.440
 So maybe there was a different origin event

1:31:20.440 --> 1:31:22.760
 and that life is weirder still

1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:25.560
 and might be among us and we could find it.

1:31:26.640 --> 1:31:28.480
 We don't have to go out and start for aliens

1:31:28.480 --> 1:31:29.880
 just here on earth.

1:31:29.880 --> 1:31:32.880
 Do you think that's a serious possibility

1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:35.160
 that we should explore with the tools of science?

1:31:35.160 --> 1:31:36.840
 Like this would be a serious effort?

1:31:36.840 --> 1:31:39.520
 I think yes and no.

1:31:39.520 --> 1:31:44.240
 And I mean, yes, because I think it's a serious hypothesis

1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:46.320
 and I think it's worth exploring

1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:48.840
 and it's certainly more economical

1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:52.040
 to look for signs of alien life on earth

1:31:52.040 --> 1:31:54.160
 than it is to go and build spacecraft

1:31:54.160 --> 1:31:56.280
 and send robots to other planets.

1:31:56.280 --> 1:31:58.360
 And that was one of the reasons it was proposed is,

1:31:58.360 --> 1:31:59.760
 well, if we do find an example

1:31:59.760 --> 1:32:02.000
 of another original life on earth,

1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:03.240
 it's hugely informative

1:32:03.240 --> 1:32:05.480
 because it means the original life is not a rare event.

1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:08.040
 If it happened twice on the same planet,

1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:09.600
 that means it's probably pretty probable

1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:11.720
 given conditions are right.

1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:14.200
 So it has huge potential scientific impact,

1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:15.720
 not to mention the fact that you might have

1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:17.640
 like biochemistry and stuff that's informative

1:32:17.640 --> 1:32:19.400
 for like medicine and stuff like that.

1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:23.360
 But I think that the thing for me that's challenging about it

1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:24.760
 and this really comes from my own work

1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:28.960
 like thinking about life as a planetary scale process

1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:31.040
 and also trying to understand

1:32:31.040 --> 1:32:33.160
 sometimes what I call like the statistical mechanics

1:32:33.160 --> 1:32:35.720
 of biochemistry but large scale statistical patterns

1:32:35.720 --> 1:32:38.480
 in the chemistry that life uses on earth.

1:32:38.480 --> 1:32:40.720
 There are a lot of regularities there

1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:45.720
 and life does seem to have planetary scale organization

1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:47.880
 that's consistent even with some of the patterns

1:32:47.880 --> 1:32:49.240
 that we see at the individual scale.

1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:52.040
 So if you think life is a planetary scale phenomena

1:32:52.040 --> 1:32:55.800
 and the chemistry of life has to be sort of not just,

1:32:55.800 --> 1:32:58.080
 it's not an individual is not necessarily

1:32:58.080 --> 1:33:00.040
 the fundamental unit of life, right?

1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:03.840
 The fundamental unit of life is these informational lineages

1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:08.280
 and they're kind of, they intersect over spatial scales.

1:33:08.280 --> 1:33:10.400
 So everything on earth is kind of related

1:33:10.400 --> 1:33:12.520
 by the common causal history.

1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:15.920
 So it's hard for me based on the way I think about the physics

1:33:15.920 --> 1:33:19.120
 and also some of the stuff that my group has done

1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:22.880
 to really think that there could be evidence

1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:25.160
 or there could be a second sample of life on earth.

1:33:25.160 --> 1:33:27.600
 But I think there are ways that we need to be more concrete

1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:28.560
 about that.

1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:32.920
 And I have thought a little bit about like you can represent

1:33:32.920 --> 1:33:35.720
 the chemistry in an individual cell as a network.

1:33:35.720 --> 1:33:39.360
 And then those networks, something my group has shown

1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:42.520
 actually scale with the same property.

1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:44.600
 So ecosystems have the same properties as individuals

1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:46.200
 as planetary scale.

1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:48.480
 And then you could imagine if you had alien chemistry

1:33:48.480 --> 1:33:50.960
 intermixed in there, that scaling would be broken.

1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:52.800
 So if there's some robustness property

1:33:52.800 --> 1:33:54.600
 or something associated to it

1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:56.040
 and you get alien chemistry in there,

1:33:56.040 --> 1:33:57.120
 it just breaks everything.

1:33:57.120 --> 1:34:00.760
 And you don't have a planetary ecosystem functioning

1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:04.600
 and individuals functioning across all these scales.

1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:08.000
 So I guess what I'm arguing is life is not a scale dependent

1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.280
 phenomenon, it's not just cellular life.

1:34:10.280 --> 1:34:11.560
 So if you have a shadow biosphere,

1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:13.600
 it has to be integrated with all of these other scales.

1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:16.200
 And that would lose the meaning

1:34:16.200 --> 1:34:17.520
 of the word shadow biosphere, I guess.

1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:18.560
 I think so, yeah.

1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:21.320
 So it's an open question, right?

1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:23.200
 And I think it would tell us a lot.

1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:25.920
 So there has been very minimal effort of people

1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:28.200
 to look for a shadow biosphere.

1:34:28.200 --> 1:34:30.480
 But then the question, it could be possible

1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:35.480
 that there's like sufficiently distinct planets

1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:38.720
 within one planet, meaning like environments

1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:39.920
 within one planet.

1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:41.360
 Like, I don't know.

1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:46.680
 I've been looking recently because of having a chat

1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:49.320
 with Catherine DeClerc about Io, the moon of Jupiter,

1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:51.640
 that's like all volcanoes and volcanoes, a bad ass.

1:34:51.640 --> 1:34:56.640
 But like imagining life inside volcanoes, right?

1:34:56.640 --> 1:35:01.640
 Like it seems like sufficiently chemically different

1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:06.000
 like to be living in the darkness where there's a lot

1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.840
 of heat and maybe you can have different earths

1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:10.400
 on like a planet.

1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:11.240
 Yeah.

1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:12.720
 Or like if you go deep enough in the crust,

1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:14.440
 maybe there's like a layer where there's no life

1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:15.920
 and then there's suddenly life again.

1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:18.920
 And maybe those, you know, lizard men

1:35:18.920 --> 1:35:20.840
 or whatever they are that people dream about

1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:22.720
 are really down there.

1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:24.200
 I know that's a little flippant,

1:35:24.200 --> 1:35:26.800
 but really like there could be like chemical cycles

1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:29.040
 deep in the earth's crust that might be alive

1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:31.680
 and are completely distinct in chemical origin

1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:33.440
 to surface life.

1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:35.440
 Right, that wouldn't be interacting with each other.

1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:36.680
 Yeah, and that's one of the proposals

1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:38.920
 for the shadow biosphere is like sometimes people talk

1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:42.640
 about it as being geologically or geographically distinct

1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:44.560
 that it might be, you know, you have no life

1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:46.720
 for this region and then a different example.

1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:47.920
 And then sometimes people talk about it

1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:50.720
 being chemically distinct that the chemistry

1:35:50.720 --> 1:35:52.960
 is sufficiently different, that it's completely orthogonal

1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:54.440
 or non interacting with our chemistry.

1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:56.000
 It seems to me at least the chemistry

1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:59.760
 is a more powerful boundary.

1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:00.600
 Yes, maybe.

1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:02.520
 Than geographic.

1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:06.440
 It just seems like life finds a way literally to travel.

1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:08.280
 Yeah, yes.

1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:11.520
 What do you think about all these UFO sightings?

1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:14.080
 So to me, it's really inspiring.

1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:19.080
 It's yet another localized way to dream about

1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:21.680
 the mysterious that is out there.

1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:22.520
 Yeah.

1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:24.640
 So I've actually been more intrigued

1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:26.560
 by the cultural phenomena UFOs

1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:28.440
 than the phenomena UFOs themselves

1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:29.760
 because I think it's intriguing

1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:34.760
 about how we are preparing ourselves mentally

1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:37.600
 for understanding others

1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:39.760
 and how we have thought about that historically

1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:43.440
 and what the sort of modern incarnations of that are.

1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:47.520
 It's more like I want an explanation for us.

1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:48.720
 That's my motivation.

1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:51.600
 And having some, you know, streaks across the sky

1:36:51.600 --> 1:36:53.200
 or something and saying that's aliens.

1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:54.960
 It doesn't tell you anything.

1:36:55.800 --> 1:36:57.600
 So unless you have a deeper explanation

1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:00.720
 and you have, you know, more lines of, you know,

1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:02.720
 where is this gonna take us in the future?

1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:04.800
 It's just not as interesting to me

1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:06.840
 as the problem of understanding life itself

1:37:06.840 --> 1:37:08.640
 and aliens as a more general phenomenon.

1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:11.080
 I do think it's just as he said,

1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:14.000
 a good way to psychologically and sociologically

1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:15.960
 prepare ourselves to sort of like,

1:37:15.960 --> 1:37:17.520
 what would that look like?

1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:18.760
 And very importantly,

1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:21.560
 which is what a lot of people talk about politically.

1:37:21.560 --> 1:37:24.560
 Sort of there's this idea from the,

1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:27.720
 so it came from the Soviet Union of like the Cold War

1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:30.120
 and we have to hide secrets.

1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:32.760
 There's some way in us searching for life

1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:35.360
 and other planets or our searching for life in general,

1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:40.920
 the way we've done government in the past,

1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:43.360
 we tend to think of all new things

1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:45.240
 as potential military secrets.

1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:47.000
 So we want to hide them.

1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.320
 And one of the ways that people kind of look

1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:51.960
 at UFO sightings is like,

1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:53.600
 maybe we shouldn't hide this stuff.

1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:55.160
 Like what is the government hiding?

1:37:55.160 --> 1:37:57.960
 I think that's a really, you know,

1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:00.200
 in one sense it's a conspiratorial question,

1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:02.480
 but I think in another,

1:38:02.480 --> 1:38:07.400
 it's an inspiration to change the way we do government

1:38:07.400 --> 1:38:10.040
 to where secrets don't,

1:38:10.040 --> 1:38:12.520
 maybe there are times when you want to keep secrets

1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:13.520
 as military secrets,

1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:16.000
 but maybe we need to release a lot more stuff

1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:20.200
 and see us as a human species as together in this whole search.

1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:22.960
 Yeah, the public engagement part there is really interesting.

1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:25.680
 And it's almost like a challenge

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:27.800
 to the way we've done stuff in the past

1:38:27.800 --> 1:38:29.600
 in terms of keeping secrets.

1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:33.320
 When they're not, so like the first step,

1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:36.640
 if you don't know how something works,

1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:38.480
 if there's a mysterious thing,

1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:42.120
 the first instinct should not be like, let's hide it.

1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:44.040
 Let's put it in the closet.

1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:46.040
 So that the Chinese or the Russian government

1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:48.880
 or whatever government doesn't find it.

1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:53.120
 Maybe the first instinct should be, let's understand it.

1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:54.720
 Perhaps let's understand it together.

1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:55.800
 Right.

1:38:55.800 --> 1:38:56.720
 No, I think that's good.

1:38:56.720 --> 1:38:58.760
 And something I realized recently

1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:00.160
 that I never thought was gonna be a problem,

1:39:00.160 --> 1:39:02.720
 but I think this actually helps with quite a bit

1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:05.840
 is because so many people nowadays

1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:08.240
 believe we've already made contact

1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:10.920
 that as an astrobiologist,

1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:13.320
 if we actually want to understand life

1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:14.640
 and make contact,

1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:17.400
 we kind of have to deconstruct the narratives

1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:18.640
 we've already built from ourselves

1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:19.960
 and kind of unteach ourselves

1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:21.440
 that we've learned about aliens

1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:22.680
 and then reteach ourselves.

1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:26.080
 So there's this really interesting sort of dialogue there

1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:27.880
 and making it open to the public

1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:29.600
 that they actually have to think critically about it

1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:30.960
 and they see the evidence for themselves,

1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:33.800
 I think is really important for that process.

1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:38.200
 Yeah, that aliens might be way weirder than we can imagine.

1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:39.320
 Yes.

1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:41.920
 Yes, I'm pretty sure they're probably weirder

1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:44.080
 than we can imagine.

1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:49.240
 Okay, we've in 2020 and still living through a pandemic,

1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:54.120
 setting the political and all those kinds of things aside,

1:39:54.120 --> 1:39:58.200
 I've always found viruses fascinating

1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:01.840
 as living as dynamical systems.

1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:03.160
 I was gonna say living systems,

1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:07.160
 but I've always kind of thought of them as living,

1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:09.280
 but that's a whole nother kind of discussion.

1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:13.320
 Maybe it'd be great to put that on the table.

1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:17.560
 One, do you find viruses beautiful slash terrifying?

1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:21.600
 And two, do you think they're living things?

1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:23.920
 Or there's some aspect to them

1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:27.800
 per our discussion of life that makes them living?

1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:30.120
 I mean, living in a pandemic saying viruses are beautiful,

1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:30.960
 it's probably a hard thing,

1:40:30.960 --> 1:40:34.480
 but I do find them beautiful to a degree.

1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:39.480
 I think even in the sense of mediating a global pandemic,

1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:41.400
 there's something like deeply intriguing there

1:40:41.400 --> 1:40:46.120
 because these are tiny, tiny little things, right?

1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:51.120
 And yet they can essentially cause a seizure,

1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:55.800
 handicap an entire civilization at a global scale.

1:40:55.800 --> 1:41:00.240
 So just that intersection between our perceived invincibility

1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:02.600
 and our susceptibility to things

1:41:02.600 --> 1:41:04.840
 and also the interaction across scales of those things

1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:09.240
 is just a really amazing feature of our world.

1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:12.640
 Most technology, whether it's viruses or AI,

1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:16.400
 that can scale in an exponential way,

1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:21.400
 like kind of run as opposed to like one thing makes

1:41:22.600 --> 1:41:24.760
 another thing, makes another thing.

1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:26.480
 It's one thing makes two things

1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:28.080
 and those two things make four things.

1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:30.920
 And then like that kind of process

1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:34.800
 also seems to be fundamental to life.

1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:39.800
 And it's terrifying because in a matter of,

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.040
 in a very short time scale,

1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:48.760
 if it's good at being life, whatever that is,

1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:53.520
 it can quickly overtake the other competing forms of life.

1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:57.720
 And that's scary both for AI and for viruses.

1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:00.560
 And it seems like understanding these processes

1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:02.000
 that are underlying viruses.

1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.240
 And I don't mean like on the virology or biology side,

1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:09.800
 but on some kind of more computational physics perspective

1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:11.320
 as we've been talking about,

1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:15.680
 seems to be really important to figure out

1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:20.680
 how humans can survive along with these kinds of,

1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:24.000
 all this kind of life.

1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.880
 And perhaps becoming a multi planetary species

1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:28.720
 is a part of that.

1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:31.720
 Like there's no, maybe like we'll figure out

1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:34.520
 from a physics perspective is like, there's no way

1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:40.680
 any living system can be stable for a prolonged period of time

1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:43.760
 and survive unless it expands exponentially throughout.

1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:46.280
 Like we have to multiply.

1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:49.960
 Otherwise anything that doesn't multiply exponentially

1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:50.880
 will die eventually.

1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:52.520
 Maybe that's a fundamental law.

1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:55.440
 Maybe.

1:42:55.440 --> 1:42:56.280
 I don't know.

1:42:56.280 --> 1:42:58.960
 You know, I always get really bothered by these Darwinian narratives

1:42:58.960 --> 1:43:01.760
 that are like the fittest replicator wins and things.

1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:04.760
 And I just don't feel like that's exactly what's going on.

1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:07.360
 I think like the copying of information is sort of

1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:10.800
 ancillary to this other process of creativity, right?

1:43:10.800 --> 1:43:13.760
 So like the drive is actually, the drive is creativity,

1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:16.640
 but if you wanna keep the creativity that's existed

1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:19.640
 in the past, it has to be copied into the future.

1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:23.280
 So replication, like if you, so that for me is,

1:43:23.280 --> 1:43:26.280
 so I had this set of arguments with Michael Lachman

1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:29.520
 and Lee Cronin about the like life being about persistence.

1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:30.720
 They thought it was about persistence

1:43:30.720 --> 1:43:32.320
 and like survival of fittest kind of thing.

1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:33.800
 And I'm like, no, it's about existence.

1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:36.680
 It's like, cause when you're talking about that,

1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:38.600
 it's easy to say that in retrospect,

1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:40.800
 you can post select on the things that survived

1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:42.920
 and then say why they survived,

1:43:42.920 --> 1:43:46.280
 but you can't do that going forward.

1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:47.960
 That's really profound.

1:43:47.960 --> 1:43:52.160
 That survival is just a nice little side effect feature

1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:56.600
 of maximizing creativity, but it doesn't need to be there.

1:43:56.600 --> 1:43:57.520
 Yeah.

1:43:57.520 --> 1:43:58.520
 That's really beautiful.

1:43:58.520 --> 1:43:59.360
 Yeah.

1:43:59.360 --> 1:44:00.200
 Yeah, that's really.

1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:01.800
 Like I said, I like optimistic theories.

1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:02.880
 Well, I don't know if that's optimistic.

1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:05.160
 That could be terrifying to people because,

1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:09.360
 because, you know, a system that maximizes creativity

1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:13.080
 may very quickly get rid of humans for some reason.

1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:15.960
 If it comes up with some other creative,

1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:18.960
 I mean, forms of existence.

1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:19.840
 Yeah.

1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:22.600
 Right, this is the AI thing is like the moment you have

1:44:22.600 --> 1:44:27.600
 an AI system that can flourish in the space of ideas

1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:33.360
 or in some other space, much more effectively than humans.

1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:36.600
 And it's sufficiently integrated into the physical space

1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:39.200
 to be able to modify the environment.

1:44:39.200 --> 1:44:41.720
 I think we'll just be like the core genetic architecture

1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:44.520
 or something will be like the DNA for AI, right?

1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:46.440
 It's like we haven't lost the past informational

1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:47.720
 architectures on this planet.

1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:49.960
 They're still there.

1:44:49.960 --> 1:44:53.880
 Yeah, so the AI will use our brains in some part

1:44:53.880 --> 1:44:58.000
 to like ride, like accelerate the exchange of ideas.

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:01.000
 That's the neural link dream is that,

1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:03.520
 well, the humans will be still around

1:45:03.520 --> 1:45:05.320
 because you're saying architecture.

1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:07.200
 Yeah, but I don't even think they necessarily need

1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:08.320
 to tap into our brains.

1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:10.400
 I mean, just collectively we do interesting things.

1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:12.200
 What if they were just using like the patterns

1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:13.840
 in our communication or something?

1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:18.120
 Oh, without controlling it, just observing?

1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:19.040
 Well, I don't know.

1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:20.760
 In what sense do you control the chemistry

1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:21.880
 happening in your body?

1:45:23.320 --> 1:45:25.240
 Hmm, yeah.

1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:27.400
 I mean, I obviously don't know.

1:45:27.400 --> 1:45:31.320
 I'm just, like the way I look at, like people look at AI

1:45:31.320 --> 1:45:33.520
 and then they look at this thing that's bigger than us

1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:36.040
 and is coming in the future and is smarter than us.

1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:38.680
 And I think though that looking at the past history

1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:41.120
 of life on the planet and what information it has been doing

1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:43.760
 for the last four billion years is probably very informative

1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:46.200
 to asking questions about what's coming next.

1:45:47.800 --> 1:45:52.520
 And I don't, one is planetary scale transitions

1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:54.360
 are really important for new phases.

1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:56.640
 So the global internet and sort of global integration

1:45:56.640 --> 1:45:58.480
 of our technology, I think is an important thing.

1:45:58.480 --> 1:46:01.080
 So that's again, life is a planetary scale phenomena,

1:46:01.080 --> 1:46:03.360
 but we're an integrated component of that phenomenon.

1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:06.520
 I don't really see that the technology is gonna replace us

1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:07.360
 in that way.

1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:09.800
 It's just gonna keep scaffolding and building.

1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:11.320
 And I also don't have an idea

1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:12.680
 that we're gonna build AI in a box.

1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:14.440
 I think AI is gonna emerge.

1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:17.080
 AGI to be is a planetary scale phenomena

1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:19.000
 that's gonna emerge from our technology.

1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:22.200
 Planetary scale phenomena.

1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:25.640
 But do you think an AGI is not distinct from humans?

1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:30.080
 Where the whole package comes as a planetary scale phenomena.

1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:30.920
 And that goes back to the fact

1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:33.320
 that like you were asking questions about you

1:46:33.320 --> 1:46:36.120
 as an individual, like what are you as an individual?

1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:38.600
 You're like a packet of information that exists

1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:41.320
 in the particular physical thing that is you.

1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:43.680
 We're all just packets of information.

1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:45.600
 And some of us are aggregates in certain ways,

1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:47.080
 but it's all just kind of exchanging

1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:49.600
 and propagating and processing.

1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:52.600
 Is your packet of information

1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:56.000
 that you've continually referred to as Sarah

1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:01.000
 afraid of the dissipation of the death of that packet?

1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:03.000
 Are you afraid of death?

1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:04.680
 Do ponder death?

1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:09.240
 Does death have meaning in this process of creativity?

1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:12.320
 I think I have the natural biological urge

1:47:12.320 --> 1:47:13.880
 that everyone has to fear death.

1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:17.800
 I think the thing that I think is interesting

1:47:17.800 --> 1:47:20.200
 is if I think about it rationally,

1:47:20.200 --> 1:47:22.080
 I'm not necessarily afraid of death for me

1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:25.280
 because I won't be aware of being dead.

1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:26.720
 But I am afraid like for my kids

1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:28.800
 because it matters to them if I die.

1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:33.720
 So again, like I think death becomes more significant

1:47:33.720 --> 1:47:36.480
 as a collective property, not as an individual one.

1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:39.280
 Yeah, but isn't there something to fear

1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:44.280
 about the fact that the way like the creative,

1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:48.560
 the complexity of information

1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:51.040
 that's been like created in you.

1:47:51.040 --> 1:47:52.120
 Yeah.

1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:57.120
 The fact that it kind of breaks apart and disappears.

1:47:57.680 --> 1:47:59.600
 It doesn't, but I don't think it disappears.

1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:01.000
 It's just not me anymore.

1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:05.760
 Right, so you're, but that process of you

1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:09.000
 it being not you anymore that doesn't scare you?

1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:09.920
 Of course it does.

1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:10.760
 The mystery of it.

1:48:10.760 --> 1:48:11.840
 I mean, the...

1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:13.360
 But I guess I'm heartened by the fact

1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:15.040
 that there will be some imprints of the fact

1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:17.960
 that I existed still in the universe after I leave it.

1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:20.200
 Yeah, but there'll be a, oh, okay.

1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:22.720
 And also that has to do with my perception of time, right?

1:48:22.720 --> 1:48:24.760
 So, I perceive time as flowing,

1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:26.360
 but that might not be the case.

1:48:27.720 --> 1:48:30.360
 I mean, this is standard physicist's comfort

1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:34.120
 is every moment exists and there's no,

1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:35.960
 and the flow of time is just our perception

1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:40.120
 of us changing.

1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:43.960
 So you can travel back in time and that's comforting?

1:48:43.960 --> 1:48:45.600
 Like from a physicist's perspective?

1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:47.400
 No, no, no, I'm not talking about traveling back in time.

1:48:47.400 --> 1:48:50.960
 I'm just saying that the moments in the past still exist.

1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:53.160
 Now, whether the moments in the future exist or not

1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:54.360
 is a different question.

1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:56.760
 That's not comforting to me in terms of death.

1:48:57.640 --> 1:48:59.560
 The flow of time does not...

1:48:59.560 --> 1:49:04.080
 I think there's no comfort in the face of death.

1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:07.880
 For what we are, because we like existing.

1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:11.560
 And I think it's especially true if you love life

1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:13.680
 and you love what life is.

1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:16.160
 Do you think there's a certain sense in which

1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:19.120
 the fear of death or the fear of nonexistence,

1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:21.400
 maybe fear is not the right word,

1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:26.400
 is the actual very phenomena that gives birth to existence?

1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:29.640
 Like death is fundamental, like this,

1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:32.600
 it just feels like freaking out, oh shit,

1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:36.880
 this ride ends is actually like the...

1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:41.280
 That's the thing that gives birth to this whole thing.

1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:42.120
 Yeah.

1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:45.560
 That like it's constantly,

1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:48.640
 it's matter constantly freaking out about the fact

1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:49.480
 that it's gonna be the most...

1:49:49.480 --> 1:49:51.600
 No, I think things like to exist.

1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:52.440
 I think they wanna exist.

1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:55.720
 Yeah, there's a desire whatever to exist.

1:49:55.720 --> 1:49:58.000
 Yeah, there's a drive to exist

1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.040
 and there's a drive for more things to exist.

1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:04.880
 I guess, yeah, I like existing, I like it a lot.

1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:07.840
 And I don't know it any other way.

1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:11.960
 See, I don't even know if I like existing,

1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:14.520
 I think I really don't like not existing.

1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:15.760
 Yes, yeah, that's you.

1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:19.760
 Yeah, maybe it's that.

1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:23.320
 Some days I might like existing less than others.

1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:27.560
 Yes, but I think those are like surface feelings.

1:50:27.560 --> 1:50:29.880
 There is some seems like there's something fundamental

1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:31.240
 about wanting to exist.

1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:34.560
 No, I think that's right, but I think to your point

1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:38.240
 that that might go back to the more fundamental idea

1:50:38.240 --> 1:50:40.640
 that if life is the physics of existence

1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:43.040
 and maximizing existence, individual organisms,

1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:45.520
 of course, wanna maximize their existence

1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:48.000
 and everything wants to exist.

1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.560
 But I guess for me, the small comfort is

1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:52.880
 my existence matters to future existence.

1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:56.040
 Speaking of future existence,

1:50:56.040 --> 1:50:58.000
 is there advice you can give

1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.880
 to future pockets of existences,

1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:04.160
 AKA young people about life?

1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:07.240
 You've had, you've worn many hats,

1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:09.160
 you've taken on some of the biggest problems

1:51:09.160 --> 1:51:10.400
 in the universe.

1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:13.000
 Is there advice you can give to young people

1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:17.280
 about life, about career, about existing?

1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:20.200
 Maybe not about the last one.

1:51:20.200 --> 1:51:23.440
 You know, a lot of people ask me this question

1:51:23.440 --> 1:51:26.120
 about like working on such hard problems,

1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:28.240
 how can you make a successful career out of that?

1:51:28.240 --> 1:51:31.560
 But I think for me, it couldn't be otherwise.

1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:33.360
 I have to be fulfilled.

1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:35.280
 You have to work on things you care about

1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:36.880
 and that's always kind of driven me.

1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:39.880
 And that's been discipline, department,

1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:44.960
 and sort of superficial level problem independent

1:51:44.960 --> 1:51:48.440
 because I started at community college actually

1:51:48.440 --> 1:51:49.760
 and I was taking a physics class

1:51:49.760 --> 1:51:53.160
 and I learned about magnetic monopoles

1:51:53.160 --> 1:51:55.480
 and we didn't know if they existed in the universe

1:51:55.480 --> 1:51:57.720
 but we could predict them and we could go look for them.

1:51:57.720 --> 1:51:59.560
 And I was so deeply intrigued by this idea

1:51:59.560 --> 1:52:01.200
 that we had this mathematical formula

1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:02.520
 to go look for things.

1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:05.160
 And then I wanted to become a theoretical physicist

1:52:05.160 --> 1:52:06.000
 because of that,

1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:07.720
 but that actually wasn't my driving question.

1:52:07.720 --> 1:52:10.640
 I realized my driving question is the nature

1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:12.160
 of the correspondence between our minds

1:52:12.160 --> 1:52:14.400
 and physical reality and what we are.

1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:16.520
 And that question's very deep

1:52:16.520 --> 1:52:18.600
 so you can work across a lot of fields doing that.

1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:20.080
 But I think without that driving question,

1:52:20.080 --> 1:52:22.320
 I never would have been able to do all the things

1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:23.160
 that I've done.

1:52:23.160 --> 1:52:25.120
 It's really the passion that drives it.

1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:28.520
 And usually when students ask me these kind of questions,

1:52:28.520 --> 1:52:31.840
 I tell them like, you have to find something

1:52:31.840 --> 1:52:33.280
 you really care about working on

1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:35.480
 because if you don't really care about it,

1:52:35.480 --> 1:52:37.920
 A, you're not gonna be your best at it

1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:39.840
 and B, it's not gonna be worth your time.

1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:41.160
 Why would you spend your time working

1:52:41.160 --> 1:52:43.080
 on something you're not interested in?

1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:44.760
 So find the driving question.

1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:46.000
 Yeah, find the driving question.

1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:47.520
 Find your passion.

1:52:47.520 --> 1:52:49.480
 I mean, I think passion makes a huge difference

1:52:49.480 --> 1:52:52.800
 in terms of creativity, talent and potential

1:52:52.800 --> 1:52:55.080
 and also being able to tolerate all the hard things

1:52:55.080 --> 1:52:57.920
 that come with any career or life.

1:52:57.920 --> 1:52:59.880
 Yeah, I've had a bunch of moments in my life

1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:01.840
 where I've just been captivated

1:53:01.840 --> 1:53:03.280
 by some beautiful phenomena

1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:06.160
 and I guess being rigorous about it

1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:09.600
 and asking what is the question underlying this phenomenon?

1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:13.440
 Like robots bring a smile to my face

1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:17.080
 and forming a question of like,

1:53:17.080 --> 1:53:19.960
 why the hell is this so fascinating?

1:53:19.960 --> 1:53:24.800
 Why is this specifically the human robot interaction question

1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:28.200
 that something beautiful is brought to life

1:53:28.200 --> 1:53:32.640
 when humans and robots interact, understanding that deeply?

1:53:32.640 --> 1:53:33.600
 Yeah.

1:53:33.600 --> 1:53:36.640
 I was like, okay, so this is gonna be my life work then.

1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:37.720
 I don't know what the hell it is,

1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:39.640
 but that's what I wanna do.

1:53:39.640 --> 1:53:40.480
 Interesting.

1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:43.000
 And doing that for whatever the hell gives you

1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.360
 that kind of feeling, I guess is the point.

1:53:45.360 --> 1:53:46.520
 Yeah.

1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:47.880
 Am I allowed to ask you a question?

1:53:47.880 --> 1:53:48.720
 Sure.

1:53:48.720 --> 1:53:50.920
 Okay, on that point,

1:53:50.920 --> 1:53:53.920
 because at this colleague that suggests the idea

1:53:53.920 --> 1:53:56.160
 that like consciousness might be contagious

1:53:56.160 --> 1:53:57.840
 and so interacting with things.

1:53:57.840 --> 1:54:01.040
 You know, it's an interesting idea, right?

1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:04.480
 So I'm wondering like sort of the motivation there.

1:54:04.480 --> 1:54:08.640
 Is it the motivation that you want more of the universe

1:54:08.640 --> 1:54:11.320
 to appreciate things the way we do

1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:12.800
 and appreciate those interactions

1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:15.320
 or is it really more the enjoyment

1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:16.640
 of the human in those interactions?

1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:20.320
 Like is it, do you know what I'm asking?

1:54:20.320 --> 1:54:21.160
 Yeah, yeah.

1:54:21.160 --> 1:54:23.840
 See, I think consciousness is created

1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:26.520
 in the interaction between things.

1:54:26.520 --> 1:54:28.200
 Yes, yes, I agree.

1:54:28.200 --> 1:54:31.120
 So the joy is in the creation of consciousness.

1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:31.960
 I see.

1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:36.960
 I really like the idea that it doesn't just have to be

1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:40.120
 two humans creating consciousness together.

1:54:40.120 --> 1:54:42.960
 It could be humans and other entities.

1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:43.800
 Yes.

1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:46.520
 There's a soft line about dogs and other pets and so on.

1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:47.360
 There's a magic.

1:54:47.360 --> 1:54:49.720
 I mean, I've been calling it love.

1:54:49.720 --> 1:54:54.320
 It's this beauty of the human experience that's created.

1:54:54.320 --> 1:54:56.320
 And it just feels like fascinating

1:54:56.320 --> 1:55:00.560
 that you could do that with a robotic system.

1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:01.400
 Right.

1:55:01.400 --> 1:55:06.400
 And there's something really powerful, at least to me,

1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:10.840
 about engineering systems that allow you to create

1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:12.600
 some of the magic of the human experience.

1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:15.440
 Cause then you get to understand what it takes,

1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:20.440
 at least get inklings of what it takes to create consciousness.

1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:24.280
 And I don't get this, you know,

1:55:24.280 --> 1:55:26.240
 philosophers get really upset about this idea

1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:29.640
 that sort of the illusion of consciousness is consciousness.

1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:33.720
 But I really like the idea of engineering systems

1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:37.240
 that fool you into thinking they're conscious.

1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:38.080
 Right.

1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:41.880
 Because that's sufficient to create the magical experience.

1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:42.720
 Right.

1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:43.560
 Because it's the interaction, yeah.

1:55:43.560 --> 1:55:44.560
 It's the interaction, yeah.

1:55:44.560 --> 1:55:45.400
 Right.

1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:47.640
 And this is the Russian hat I wear,

1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:51.040
 which is like, I think there's an ocean of loneliness

1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:51.960
 in the world.

1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:53.440
 I think we're deeply lonely.

1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:57.240
 We're not even allowing ourselves to acknowledge that.

1:55:57.240 --> 1:55:59.200
 And I kind of think that's what love is

1:55:59.200 --> 1:56:01.960
 between romantic love and friendship,

1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:05.840
 is two people kind of getting a little bit,

1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:10.840
 like alleviating for a brief moment.

1:56:10.840 --> 1:56:12.040
 That loneliness.

1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:12.880
 That loneliness.

1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:17.880
 But we're not, it's not the full aspect of that loneliness.

1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:19.440
 Like we're desperately alone.

1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:22.600
 We're desperately afraid of nonexisting.

1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:23.440
 Right.

1:56:23.440 --> 1:56:24.600
 I have that kind of sense.

1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:28.200
 And I just want to explore that ocean of loneliness more.

1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:29.040
 Right.

1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:30.880
 When engineering, like create a submarine

1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:33.760
 that goes into the depth of that loneliness.

1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:36.600
 So creating systems that can truly hear you.

1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:37.440
 Right.

1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:38.280
 And truly listen.

1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:39.800
 Make the universe a less lonely place.

1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:40.640
 Exactly.

1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:43.160
 Let me ask you about the meaning.

1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:44.800
 You've brought up why.

1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:45.640
 Yeah.

1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:46.480
 The physics of why.

1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:51.120
 What do you think is the meaning of our particular planets,

1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:54.580
 set of existences and the universe in general?

1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:57.040
 The meaning of life.

1:56:57.040 --> 1:56:57.880
 Yes.

1:56:57.880 --> 1:56:59.040
 Someone once told me as a physicist,

1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:00.800
 I'm not allowed to ask why questions,

1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:01.960
 but I don't believe that.

1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:06.960
 So I think what we are is the creative process

1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:08.520
 in the universe, I think.

1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:10.160
 And for me, that's the meaning.

1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:12.000
 The ability to create.

1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:12.840
 Yeah.

1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:16.400
 To create more possibilities and more things to exist.

1:57:17.400 --> 1:57:20.640
 What does the Yeski as the saying,

1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:22.840
 beauty will save the world.

1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:28.840
 What is, is there a connection between creation and beauty?

1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:31.040
 I think so.

1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:34.200
 So is that like, are they,

1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:37.080
 is beauty a correlate of creation?

1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:37.920
 It might be.

1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:38.760
 I don't know.

1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:40.680
 I mean, why is it, you know,

1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:42.400
 a lot of people have asked these kinds of questions,

1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:44.680
 but like, why is it we have such an emotional response

1:57:44.680 --> 1:57:46.840
 to intellectual activity or creativity?

1:57:47.840 --> 1:57:49.960
 And that seems kind of a deep question to me.

1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:53.160
 Like, it seems very intrinsic to what we are.

1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:57.280
 So I do have an interest in the questions I asked

1:57:57.280 --> 1:57:58.840
 because I think they're beautiful.

1:57:58.840 --> 1:58:00.480
 And I think the universe is beautiful.

1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:01.880
 And I think that's the reason

1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:06.480
 the universe is beautiful and I'm just so deeply fascinated

1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:08.400
 by the fact that I exist at all.

1:58:10.480 --> 1:58:13.600
 And so maybe, maybe it's that, you know,

1:58:13.600 --> 1:58:15.720
 that, that intrinsic feeling of beauty

1:58:15.720 --> 1:58:17.520
 that's in part driving, you know,

1:58:17.520 --> 1:58:19.120
 the physics of creating more things.

1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:22.200
 So they could be deeply related in that way.

1:58:22.200 --> 1:58:24.800
 Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it.

1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:27.240
 I think this conversation was beautiful.

1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:30.920
 Thank you so much for wasting all your valuable time

1:58:30.920 --> 1:58:32.080
 with me today.

1:58:32.080 --> 1:58:33.640
 I really, really appreciate it, Sarah.

1:58:33.640 --> 1:58:34.480
 This is an honor.

1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:36.120
 I hope we get the chance to talk again.

1:58:36.120 --> 1:58:38.280
 I hope, like I mentioned to you offline,

1:58:38.280 --> 1:58:39.720
 we get a chance to talk with Lee.

1:58:39.720 --> 1:58:44.720
 You guys have a beautiful, like, intellectual chemistry

1:58:44.880 --> 1:58:46.120
 that's fascinating to listen to.

1:58:46.120 --> 1:58:47.480
 So I'm a huge fan of both of you

1:58:47.480 --> 1:58:49.800
 and I can't wait to see what you do next.

1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:50.640
 Thanks so much.

1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:51.680
 Great to be here.

1:58:51.680 --> 1:58:53.240
 Fun.

1:58:53.240 --> 1:58:55.840
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sarah Walker.

1:58:55.840 --> 1:58:59.080
 And thank you to Athletic Greens, Nutsweet,

1:58:59.080 --> 1:59:01.480
 Blinkist, and Magic Spoon.

1:59:01.480 --> 1:59:04.720
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

1:59:04.720 --> 1:59:06.400
 And now let me leave you with some words

1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:09.840
 from Robert Frost, one of my favorite poets.

1:59:09.840 --> 1:59:12.000
 In three words, I can sum up everything

1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:13.920
 I've learned about life.

1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:15.120
 It goes on.

1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:17.160
 Thank you for listening.

1:59:17.160 --> 1:59:29.320
 I hope to see you next time.
