00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
 The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis.

00:03.040 --> 00:08.560
 He's a professor at MIT and head of the MIT Computational Biology Group.

00:08.560 --> 00:12.400
 He's interested in understanding the human genome from a computational,

00:12.400 --> 00:16.960
 evolutionary, biological, and other cross disciplinary perspectives.

00:16.960 --> 00:21.360
 He has more big impactful papers and awards than I can list.

00:21.360 --> 00:25.040
 But most importantly, he's a kind, curious, brilliant

00:25.040 --> 00:28.640
 human being and just someone I really enjoy talking to.

00:28.640 --> 00:32.800
 His passion for science and life in general is contagious.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.600
 The hours honestly flew by and I'm sure we'll talk again on this podcast soon.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.240

01:35.200 --> 01:38.800
 I'm a big believer in reading at least an hour every day.

01:38.800 --> 01:43.040
 As part of that, I use blinkist every day to try out a book

01:43.040 --> 01:45.360
 I may otherwise never have a chance to read.

01:45.360 --> 01:50.000

02:24.560 --> 02:26.640
 It controls temperature with an app.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.800
 It can cool down to as low as 55 degrees on each side of the bed separately.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.960
 Research shows that temperature has a big impact on the quality of our sleep.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.760
 Anecdotally, it's been true for me.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.760
 It's truly been a game changer.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.720
 I love it.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.360
 The PodPro is packed with sensors that track heart rate,

02:43.360 --> 02:48.000
 heart rate variability and respiratory rate showing it all in their app.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.800
 The app's health metrics are amazing, but the cooling alone is honestly worth the money.

 the greatest chess player of all time.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.640
 I'm not biased.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.960
 Daniel Negrano on poker and many more.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.800
 Chris Hadfield explaining how rockets work and the experience of being

03:36.800 --> 03:39.920
 launched into space alone is worth the money.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.960

03:49.520 --> 03:53.200
 And now here's my conversation with Manolis Kellis.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.000
 What to you is the most beautiful aspect of the human genome?

03:58.560 --> 03:59.760
 Don't get me started.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.040
 So we got time.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.520
 The first answer is that the beauty of genomes transcends humanity.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.440
 So it's not just about the human genome.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.560
 Genomes in general are amazingly beautiful.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.000
 And again, I'm obviously biased.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.360
 So in my view, the way that I like to introduce the human genome

04:19.360 --> 04:22.160
 and the way that I like to introduce genomics to my class

04:22.160 --> 04:24.880
 is by telling them, you know, we're not the inventors

04:24.880 --> 04:26.480
 of the first digital computer.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.120
 We are the descendants of the first digital computer.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.240
 Basically, life is digital.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.480
 And that's absolutely beautiful about life.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.040
 The fact that at every replication step,

04:37.040 --> 04:40.000
 you don't lose any information because that information is digital.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.040
 If it was analog, if it was just protein concentrations,

04:43.040 --> 04:44.640
 you'd lose it after a few generations.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.240
 It would just dissolve away.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.000
 And that's what the ancients didn't understand about inheritance.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.080
 The first person to understand digital inheritance

04:52.080 --> 04:54.400
 was Mendel, of course.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.880
 And his theory, in fact, stayed in a bookshelf for like 50 years

04:58.880 --> 05:02.320
 while Darwin was getting famous about natural selection.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.440
 But the missing component was this digital inheritance,

05:05.440 --> 05:09.600
 the mechanism of evolution that Mendel had discovered.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.960
 So that aspect, in my view, is the most beautiful aspect,

05:12.960 --> 05:14.720
 but it transcends all of life.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.920
 And can you elaborate maybe the inheritance part?

05:17.920 --> 05:21.760
 What was the key thing that the ancients didn't understand?

05:22.400 --> 05:27.200
 So the very theory of inheritance as discrete units

05:28.400 --> 05:32.720
 throughout the life of Mendel and well after his writing,

05:32.720 --> 05:36.400
 people thought that his P experiments were just a little fluke,

05:36.400 --> 05:38.560
 that they were just a little exception

05:38.560 --> 05:41.760
 that would normally not even apply to humans.

05:41.760 --> 05:48.000
 That basically what they saw is this continuum of eye color,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.960
 this continuum of skin color, this continuum of hair color,

05:50.960 --> 05:52.560
 this continuum of height.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.960
 And all of these continuums did not fit

05:54.960 --> 05:57.760
 with a discrete type of inheritance that Mendel was describing.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.320
 But what's unique about genomics

06:00.320 --> 06:01.520
 and what's unique about the genome

06:01.520 --> 06:03.760
 is really that there are two copies

06:03.760 --> 06:05.680
 and that you get a combination of these.

06:05.680 --> 06:10.000
 But for every trait, there are dozens of contributing variables.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.360
 And it was only Ronald Fisher in the 20th century

06:13.360 --> 06:19.520
 that basically recognized that even five Mendelian traits

06:19.520 --> 06:23.760
 would add up to a continuum like inheritance pattern.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.880
 And he wrote a series of papers

06:26.880 --> 06:29.360
 that still are very relevant today

06:29.360 --> 06:34.400
 about this Mendelian inheritance of continuum like traits.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.200
 And I think that that was the missing step in inheritance.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.800
 So well before the discovery of the structure of DNA,

06:40.800 --> 06:43.600
 which is again another amazingly beautiful aspect,

06:43.600 --> 06:45.280
 the double helix, what I like to call

06:45.280 --> 06:47.680
 the most noble molecule of our time,

06:47.680 --> 06:52.480
 holds within it the secret of that discrete inheritance.

06:53.360 --> 06:57.600
 But the conceptualization of discrete elements

06:57.600 --> 06:58.880
 is something that precedes that.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.400
 So even though it's discrete,

07:00.400 --> 07:05.840
 when it materializes itself into actual traits that we see,

07:05.840 --> 07:10.000
 it can be continuous and basically arbitrarily rich and complex.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.240
 So if you have five genes that contribute to human height,

07:14.240 --> 07:16.160
 and there aren't five, there's a thousand.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.680
 If there's only five genes,

07:17.680 --> 07:20.000
 and you inherit some combination of them,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.280
 and everyone makes you two inches taller or two inches shorter,

07:23.280 --> 07:26.640
 it'll look like a continuum trait, a continuous trait.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.360
 But instead of five, there are thousands,

07:29.360 --> 07:31.600
 and every one of them contributes to less than one millimeter.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.640
 We change in height more during the day

07:35.440 --> 07:37.600
 than each of these genetic variants contributes.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.640
 So by the evening, you're shorter than you were, you walk up with.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.640
 Isn't it weird then that we're not more different than we are?

07:46.640 --> 07:48.480
 Why are we all so similar

07:48.480 --> 07:51.280
 if there's so much possibility to be different?

07:51.280 --> 07:54.640
 Yeah, so there are selective advantages

07:54.640 --> 07:57.440
 to being medium.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.840
 If you're extremely tall or extremely short,

07:59.840 --> 08:02.160
 you run into selective disadvantages.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.080
 So you have trouble breathing, you have trouble running,

08:04.080 --> 08:04.960
 you have trouble sitting.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.960
 If you're too tall, if you're too short,

08:06.960 --> 08:10.880
 you might have other selective pressures acting against that.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.520
 If you look at natural history of human population,

08:13.520 --> 08:16.880
 there's actually selection for height in northern Europe

08:16.880 --> 08:19.200
 and selection against height in southern Europe.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.680
 So there might actually be advantages

08:21.680 --> 08:24.800
 to actually being not super tall.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.280
 And if you look across the entire human population,

08:28.560 --> 08:31.200
 for many, many traits, there's a lot of push towards the middle.

08:31.920 --> 08:36.480
 Balancing selection is the usual term for selection

08:36.480 --> 08:38.880
 that seeks to not be extreme

08:39.600 --> 08:45.840
 and to have a combination of alleles that keep recombining.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.480
 And if you look at mate selection,

08:48.480 --> 08:51.760
 super, super tall people will not tend to sort of marry

08:51.760 --> 08:53.200
 super, super tall people.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.040
 Very often you see these couples

08:55.040 --> 08:57.840
 that are kind of compensating for each other.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.320
 And the best predictor of the kid's age

09:00.320 --> 09:03.360
 is very often just take the average of the two parents

09:03.360 --> 09:06.880
 and then adjust for sex and boom, you get it.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.400
 It's extremely heritable.

09:08.400 --> 09:12.640
 Let me ask, you kind of took a step back to the genome

09:12.640 --> 09:13.760
 outside of just humans,

09:13.760 --> 09:15.760
 but is there something that you find beautiful

09:15.760 --> 09:18.720
 about the human genome specifically?

09:18.720 --> 09:23.040
 So I think the genome, if more people understood

09:23.040 --> 09:24.400
 the beauty of the human genome,

09:24.400 --> 09:26.560
 they would be so many fewer wars,

09:26.560 --> 09:28.880
 so much less anger in the world.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.360
 I mean, what's really beautiful about the human genome

09:31.360 --> 09:33.040
 is really the variation

09:33.840 --> 09:36.400
 that teaches us both about individuality

09:36.400 --> 09:37.600
 and about similarity.

09:38.160 --> 09:42.160
 So any two people on the planet are 99.9% identical.

09:42.160 --> 09:46.160
 How can you fight with someone who's 99.9% identical to you?

09:46.160 --> 09:47.840
 It's just counterintuitive.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.400
 And yet any two siblings of the same parents

09:52.400 --> 09:55.600
 differ in millions of locations.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.800
 So every one of them is basically two to the million

09:58.800 --> 10:01.120
 unique from any pair of parents,

10:01.680 --> 10:04.160
 let alone any two random parents on the planet.

10:04.160 --> 10:07.200
 So that's, I think, something that teaches us

10:07.200 --> 10:09.840
 about sort of the nature of humanity in many ways

10:09.840 --> 10:13.200
 that every one of us is as unique as any star

10:13.200 --> 10:15.200
 and way more unique in actually many ways.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.320
 And yet, we're all brothers and sisters.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.720
 Yeah, just like stars, most of it is just fusion reactions.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.040
 Yeah, you only have a few parameters to describe stars.

10:27.040 --> 10:27.920
 Yeah, exactly.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.600
 You know, mass size, initial size, and stage of life.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.960
 Whereas for humans, thousands of parameters

10:34.960 --> 10:36.400
 scattered across our genome.

10:36.400 --> 10:40.800
 Scattered across our genome. So the other thing that makes humans unique,

10:41.360 --> 10:45.840
 the other things that makes inheritance unique in humans is that

10:47.200 --> 10:50.320
 most species inherit things vertically.

10:50.320 --> 10:53.920
 Basically, instinct is a huge part of their behavior.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.440
 The way that, you know, I mean, with my kids,

10:57.440 --> 11:02.160
 we've been watching this nest of birds with two little eggs,

11:02.160 --> 11:04.320
 you know, outside our window for the last few months,

11:04.320 --> 11:06.880
 for the last few weeks as they've been growing.

11:07.440 --> 11:11.360
 And there's so much behavior that's hard coded.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.200
 Birds don't just learn as they grow.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.120
 They don't, you know, there's no culture.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.080
 Like a bird that's born in Boston will be the same

11:20.080 --> 11:22.000
 as a bird that's born in California.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.360
 So there's not as much inheritance of ideas, of customs.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.400
 A lot of it is hard coding in their genome.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.800
 What's really beautiful about the human genome is that

11:32.800 --> 11:34.880
 if you take a person from today

11:34.880 --> 11:36.960
 and you place them back in ancient Egypt,

11:36.960 --> 11:39.040
 or if you take a person from ancient Egypt

11:39.040 --> 11:40.400
 and you place them here today,

11:41.040 --> 11:42.880
 they will grow up to be completely normal.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.600
 That is not genetics.

11:47.600 --> 11:51.680
 This is the other type of inheritance in humans.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.760
 So on one hand, we have genetic inheritance,

11:53.760 --> 11:56.000
 which is vertical from your parents down.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.320
 On the other hand, we have horizontal inheritance,

11:58.320 --> 12:02.320
 which is the ideas that are built up at every generation

12:02.320 --> 12:03.920
 are horizontally transmitted.

12:04.480 --> 12:08.720
 And the huge amount of time that we spend in educating ourselves,

12:09.360 --> 12:11.200
 a concept known as neoteny,

12:11.840 --> 12:15.120
 neo for newborn and then teni for holding.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.200
 So if you look at humans,

12:17.200 --> 12:20.240
 I mean the little birds that were, you know, eggs two weeks ago,

12:20.240 --> 12:22.480
 and now one of them has already flown off.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.680
 The other one's ready to fly off.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.720
 In two weeks, they're ready to just fend for themselves.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.440
 Humans, 16 years.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.880
 18 years, 24, getting out of college.

12:32.880 --> 12:33.680
 I'm still learning.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.640
 So that's so fascinating, this picture of vertical and horizontal.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.920
 When you talk about the horizontal is in the realm of ideas.

12:41.920 --> 12:42.560
 Exactly.

12:42.560 --> 12:42.800
 Okay.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.120
 So it's the actual social interactions.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.000
 That's exactly right.

12:46.000 --> 12:46.960
 That's exactly right.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.120
 So basically the concept of neoteny

12:49.120 --> 12:54.080
 is that you spend acquiring characteristics from your environment

12:54.080 --> 12:56.800
 in an extremely malleable state of your brain

12:56.800 --> 12:58.400
 and the wiring of your brain

12:58.400 --> 12:59.920
 for a long period of your life.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.360
 Compared to primates, we are useless.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.200
 You take any primate at seven weeks

13:05.200 --> 13:08.240
 and in human at seven weeks, we lose the battle.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.520
 But at 18 years, you know, all better off.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.000
 Like we basically, our brain continues to develop

13:14.720 --> 13:17.840
 in an extremely malleable form till very late.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.240
 And this is what allows education.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.320
 This is what allows the person from Egypt

13:22.320 --> 13:23.920
 to do extremely well now.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.640
 And the reason for that is that

13:26.640 --> 13:29.440
 the wiring of our brain

13:30.160 --> 13:32.880
 and the development of that wiring is actually delayed.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.920
 So, you know, the longer you delay that,

13:35.920 --> 13:39.360
 the more opportunity you have to pass on knowledge,

13:39.360 --> 13:44.400
 to pass on concepts, ideals, ideas from the parents to the child.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.360
 And what's really absolutely beautiful about humans today

13:47.360 --> 13:50.320
 is that that lateral transfer of ideas and culture

13:50.320 --> 13:53.840
 is not just from uncles and aunts and teachers at school,

13:53.840 --> 13:58.320
 but it's from Wikipedia and review articles on the web

13:58.320 --> 14:00.640
 and thousands of journals

14:00.640 --> 14:03.600
 that are sort of putting out information for free

14:03.600 --> 14:06.880
 and podcasts and video casts and all of that stuff,

14:06.880 --> 14:10.640
 where you can basically learn about any topic

14:10.640 --> 14:13.600
 pretty much everything that would be

14:13.600 --> 14:17.200
 in any super advanced textbook in a matter of days,

14:17.200 --> 14:21.040
 instead of having to go to the library of Alexandria

14:21.040 --> 14:24.240
 and sail there to read three books and then sail for another few days

14:24.240 --> 14:26.720
 to get to Athens and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.280
 So, the democratization of knowledge

14:29.280 --> 14:32.320
 and the spread, the speed of spread of knowledge,

14:32.320 --> 14:36.800
 is what defines, I think, the human inheritance pattern.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.440
 So, you sound excited about it.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.760
 Are you also a little bit afraid,

14:41.760 --> 14:45.360
 or are you more excited by the power of this kind of

14:45.360 --> 14:47.920
 distributed spread of information?

14:47.920 --> 14:49.360
 So, you put a very kind,

14:49.360 --> 14:53.360
 that most people are kind of using the internet

14:53.360 --> 14:58.080
 in looking Wikipedia, reading articles, reading papers, and so on,

14:58.080 --> 15:01.920
 but if we're honest, most people online,

15:01.920 --> 15:03.200
 especially when they're younger,

15:03.200 --> 15:05.760
 probably looking at five second clips on TikTok

15:05.760 --> 15:08.480
 or whatever the new social network is,

15:08.480 --> 15:12.480
 are you, given this power of horizontal inheritance,

15:12.480 --> 15:16.480
 are you optimistic or a little bit pessimistic

15:16.480 --> 15:22.400
 about this new effect of the internet

15:22.400 --> 15:26.880
 and democratization of knowledge on our,

15:26.880 --> 15:28.640
 what would you call this, this genome?

15:28.640 --> 15:31.200
 Like, would you use the term genome, by the way, for this?

15:31.200 --> 15:32.320
 Yeah, yeah.

15:32.320 --> 15:36.080
 I think, you know, we use the genome to talk about DNA,

15:36.080 --> 15:38.800
 but very often we say, you know, I'm Greek,

15:38.800 --> 15:40.800
 so people ask me, hey, what's in the Greek genome?

15:40.800 --> 15:42.720
 And I'm like, well, yeah, what's in the Greek genome

15:42.720 --> 15:45.680
 is both our genes and also our ideas and our ideals

15:45.680 --> 15:46.800
 and our culture, so.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.160
 The poetic meaning of the word.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.000
 Exactly, exactly, yeah.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.840
 So I think that there's a beauty

15:55.840 --> 15:57.600
 to the democratization of knowledge,

15:57.600 --> 16:00.160
 the fact that you can reach as many people

16:00.160 --> 16:02.720
 as, you know, any other person on the planet

16:02.720 --> 16:04.160
 and it's not who you are,

16:04.160 --> 16:05.760
 it's really your ideas that matter,

16:06.640 --> 16:08.800
 is a beautiful aspect of the internet.

16:09.680 --> 16:13.200
 The, I think there's, of course,

16:13.200 --> 16:18.160
 a danger of my ignorance is as important as your expertise.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.280
 The fact that with this democratization

16:21.280 --> 16:25.040
 comes the abolishment of respecting expertise.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.880
 Just because you've spent, you know, 10,000 hours of your life

16:28.880 --> 16:32.640
 studying, I don't know, human brain circuitry,

16:33.200 --> 16:34.000
 why should I trust you?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.520
 I'm just going to make up my own theories

16:35.520 --> 16:37.120
 and they'll be just as good as yours,

16:37.120 --> 16:39.520
 is an attitude that sort of counteracts

16:39.520 --> 16:41.760
 the beauty of the different democratization.

16:41.760 --> 16:46.720
 And I think that within our educational system

16:46.720 --> 16:48.960
 and within the upbringing of our children,

16:48.960 --> 16:51.520
 we have to not only teach them knowledge,

16:51.520 --> 16:54.560
 but we have to teach them the means to get to knowledge.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.440
 And that, you know, it's very similar to sort of,

16:57.440 --> 17:00.640
 you fish, you catch a fish for a man for one day,

17:00.640 --> 17:03.040
 you fed them for one day, you teach them how to fish,

17:03.040 --> 17:04.640
 you fed them for the rest of their life.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.600
 So instead of just gathering the knowledge they need

17:07.600 --> 17:09.520
 for any one task, we can just tell them,

17:09.520 --> 17:12.400
 all right, here's how you Google it.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.480
 Here's how to figure out what's real and what's not.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.320
 Here's how you check the sources.

17:16.320 --> 17:19.200
 Here's how you form a basic opinion for yourself.

17:19.200 --> 17:24.640
 And I think that inquisitive nature is paramount

17:24.640 --> 17:29.200
 to being able to sort through this huge wealth of knowledge.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.920
 So you need a basic educational foundation

17:32.480 --> 17:35.440
 based on which you can then add on

17:35.440 --> 17:38.000
 the sort of domain specific knowledge.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.640
 But that basic educational foundation should just,

17:40.640 --> 17:45.120
 not just be knowledge, but it should also be epistemology,

17:45.120 --> 17:46.480
 the way to acquire knowledge.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.480
 I'm not sure any of us know how to do that in this modern day.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.520
 We're actually learning.

17:51.520 --> 17:56.400
 One of the big surprising things to me about the coronavirus,

17:56.400 --> 17:58.800
 for example, is that Twitter has been

17:59.600 --> 18:01.840
 one of the best sources of information.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.520
 Basically, like building your own network of experts,

18:05.520 --> 18:10.960
 of, as opposed to the traditional centralized expertise

18:10.960 --> 18:16.560
 of the WHO and the CDC or maybe any one particular

18:17.600 --> 18:20.560
 respectable person at the top of a department

18:20.560 --> 18:21.680
 and some kind of institution.

18:21.680 --> 18:26.480
 You instead look at 10, 20 hundreds of people,

18:26.480 --> 18:32.320
 some of whom are young kids with just that are incredibly

18:32.320 --> 18:34.160
 good at aggregating data and plotting

18:34.160 --> 18:35.680
 and visualizing that data.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.120
 That's been really surprising to me.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.320
 I don't know what to make of it.

18:39.760 --> 18:43.920
 I don't know how that matures into something stable.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.400
 I don't know if you have ideas.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.040
 Like what if you were to try to explain to your kids

18:49.840 --> 18:54.720
 of how, where should you go to learn about coronavirus?

18:55.840 --> 18:56.720
 What would you say?

18:56.720 --> 18:57.920
 It's such a beautiful example.

18:57.920 --> 19:01.520
 And I think the current pandemic and the speed at which

19:01.520 --> 19:03.040
 the scientific community has moved

19:03.040 --> 19:05.680
 in the current pandemic, I think exemplifies

19:06.320 --> 19:08.960
 this horizontal transfer and the speed of horizontal

19:08.960 --> 19:10.000
 transfer of information.

19:10.720 --> 19:16.240
 The fact that the genome was first sequenced in early January.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.600
 The first sample was obtained December 29, 2019,

19:20.240 --> 19:23.280
 a week after the publication of the first genome sequence

19:24.320 --> 19:26.480
 Moderna had already finalized its vaccine design

19:27.520 --> 19:28.880
 and was moving to production.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.680
 This is phenomenal.

19:31.680 --> 19:35.200
 The fact that we go from not knowing what the heck

19:35.200 --> 19:40.160
 is killing people in Wuhan to, wow, it's SARS CoV2

19:40.160 --> 19:42.560
 and here's the set of genes, here's the genome,

19:42.560 --> 19:44.960
 here's the sequence, here are the polymorphisms, etc.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.080
 In the matter of weeks is phenomenal.

19:48.080 --> 19:52.720
 In that incredible pace of transfer of knowledge,

19:52.720 --> 19:54.320
 there have been many mistakes.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.720
 So, you know, some of those mistakes may have

19:56.720 --> 19:57.840
 been politically motivated.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.720
 Our other mistakes may have just been innocuous errors.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.840
 Others may have been misleading the public for the greater good,

20:03.840 --> 20:07.040
 such as don't wear masks because we don't want the mask to run out.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.160
 I mean, that was very silly in my view and a very big mistake.

20:11.280 --> 20:16.240
 But the spread of knowledge from the scientific community

20:16.240 --> 20:20.560
 was phenomenal and some people will point out to bogus articles

20:20.560 --> 20:22.160
 that snuck in and made the front page.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.440
 Yeah, they did, but within 24 hours they were debunked

20:26.080 --> 20:27.360
 and went out of the front page.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.000
 And I think that's the beauty of science today.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.040
 The fact that it's not, oh, knowledge is fixed.

20:33.040 --> 20:36.800
 It's the ability to embrace that nothing is permanent

20:36.800 --> 20:37.760
 when it comes to knowledge,

20:37.760 --> 20:40.000
 that everything is the current best hypothesis

20:40.000 --> 20:42.960
 and the current best model that best fits the current data

20:42.960 --> 20:44.720
 and the willingness to be wrong.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.160
 The expectation that we're going to be wrong

20:48.160 --> 20:50.560
 and the celebration of success based on

20:50.560 --> 20:52.640
 how long was I not proven wrong for

20:52.640 --> 20:55.440
 rather than, wow, I was exactly right

20:55.440 --> 20:56.880
 because no one is going to be exactly right

20:56.880 --> 21:02.960
 with partial knowledge, but the arc towards perfection,

21:02.960 --> 21:07.200
 I think is so much more important than how far you are

21:07.200 --> 21:07.920
 in your first step.

21:08.480 --> 21:13.200
 And I think that's what sort of the current pandemic has taught us,

21:13.200 --> 21:15.920
 the fact that, yeah, no, of course we're going to make mistakes,

21:15.920 --> 21:18.240
 but at least we're going to learn from those mistakes

21:18.240 --> 21:20.160
 and become better and learn better

21:20.160 --> 21:21.200
 and spread information better.

21:21.200 --> 21:24.080
 So if I were to answer the question of where would you go

21:24.080 --> 21:28.720
 to learn about coronavirus, first textbook,

21:28.720 --> 21:29.840
 it all starts with a textbook.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.480
 Just open up a chapter on virology

21:32.480 --> 21:33.760
 and how coronavirus is work.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.800
 Then some basic epidemiology

21:36.800 --> 21:39.120
 and sort of how pandemics have worked in the past.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.840
 What are the basic principles surrounding

21:41.840 --> 21:43.360
 these first wave, second wave?

21:43.360 --> 21:44.560
 Why do they even exist?

21:45.280 --> 21:47.120
 Then understanding about growth,

21:47.120 --> 21:52.560
 understanding about the R0 and RT at various time points.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.280
 And then understanding the means of spread,

21:55.280 --> 21:57.280
 how it spreads from person to person,

21:57.280 --> 21:59.440
 then how does it get into your cells?

22:00.080 --> 22:01.440
 From when it gets into the cells,

22:01.440 --> 22:03.120
 what are the paths that it takes?

22:03.120 --> 22:05.040
 What are the cell types that express

22:05.040 --> 22:07.200
 the particular ACE2 receptor?

22:07.200 --> 22:09.280
 How is your immune system interacting with the virus?

22:09.840 --> 22:12.240
 And once your immune system launches it defense,

22:12.240 --> 22:14.800
 how is that helping or actually hurting your health?

22:15.360 --> 22:16.800
 What about the cytokine storm?

22:16.800 --> 22:18.480
 What are most people dying from?

22:18.480 --> 22:23.840
 Why are the comorbidities and these risk factors even applying?

22:23.840 --> 22:25.840
 What makes obese people respond more

22:25.840 --> 22:28.080
 or elderly people respond more to the virus

22:28.800 --> 22:33.200
 while kids are completely, very often,

22:33.760 --> 22:35.600
 not even aware that they're spreading it?

22:36.320 --> 22:41.040
 So I think there's some basic questions

22:41.040 --> 22:42.640
 that you would start from.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.240
 And then I'm sorry to say,

22:44.240 --> 22:45.760
 but Wikipedia is pretty awesome.

22:45.760 --> 22:46.720
 Google is pretty awesome.

22:46.720 --> 22:50.400
 It used to be a time maybe five years ago.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.920
 I forget when,

22:51.920 --> 22:54.160
 but people kind of made fun of Wikipedia

22:54.160 --> 22:57.120
 for being an unreliable source.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.400
 I never quite understood it.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.040
 I thought from the early days it was pretty reliable.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.520
 They're better than a lot of the alternatives.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.640
 But at this point,

23:04.640 --> 23:08.240
 it's kind of like a solid accessible survey paper

23:08.240 --> 23:09.680
 on every subject ever.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.560
 There's an ascertainment bias and a writing bias.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.680
 So I think this is related to people saying,

23:17.680 --> 23:19.600
 oh, so many nature papers are wrong.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.400
 And they're like, why would you publish in nature?

23:22.400 --> 23:23.600
 So many nature papers are wrong.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.000
 And my answer is, no, no, no.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.480
 So many nature papers are scrutinized.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.840
 And just because more of them are being proven wrong

23:31.840 --> 23:35.200
 than in other articles is actually evidence

23:35.200 --> 23:36.960
 that they're actually better paper overall

23:36.960 --> 23:38.560
 because they're being scrutinized at a rate

23:39.200 --> 23:40.960
 much higher than any other journal.

23:40.960 --> 23:45.600
 So if you basically judge Wikipedia

23:45.600 --> 23:49.840
 by not the initial content,

23:49.840 --> 23:52.320
 but by the number of revisions,

23:52.320 --> 23:53.360
 then of course it's going to be

23:53.360 --> 23:55.200
 the best source of knowledge eventually.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.960
 It's still very superficial.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.640
 You then have to go into the review papers,

23:58.640 --> 24:00.160
 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

24:00.160 --> 24:03.280
 But I mean, for most scientific topics,

24:03.280 --> 24:05.040
 it's extremely superficial.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.680
 But it is quite authoritative

24:07.680 --> 24:09.120
 because it is the place

24:09.120 --> 24:11.600
 that everybody likes to criticize as being wrong.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.520
 You say that it's superficial.

24:13.520 --> 24:17.600
 And a lot of topics that I've studied a lot of,

24:18.240 --> 24:21.840
 I find it, I don't know if superficial is the right word

24:24.160 --> 24:25.600
 because superficial kind of implies

24:25.600 --> 24:27.680
 that it's not correct.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.320
 No, no, I don't mean any implication

24:30.320 --> 24:31.520
 of it not being correct.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.720
 It's just superficial.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.800
 It's basically only scratching the surface.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.960
 For depth, you don't go to Wikipedia

24:36.960 --> 24:38.240
 and you go to the review articles.

24:38.240 --> 24:41.680
 But it can be profound in the way that articles rarely,

24:41.680 --> 24:43.440
 one of the frustrating things to me about

24:44.640 --> 24:46.400
 like certain computer science,

24:46.400 --> 24:48.320
 like in the machine learning world,

24:48.320 --> 24:53.920
 articles, they don't as often take the bigger picture view.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.280
 There's a kind of data set and you show that it works

24:57.280 --> 24:59.520
 and you kind of show that here's an architectural thing

24:59.520 --> 25:02.160
 that creates an improvement and so on and so forth.

25:02.160 --> 25:05.200
 But you don't say, well, what does this mean

25:05.200 --> 25:07.200
 for the nature of intelligence,

25:07.200 --> 25:09.920
 for future data sets we haven't even thought about

25:09.920 --> 25:11.760
 or if you were trying to implement this,

25:11.760 --> 25:15.760
 like if we took this data set of 100,000 examples

25:15.760 --> 25:19.120
 and scale it to 100 billion examples with this method,

25:19.120 --> 25:21.040
 like look at the bigger picture,

25:21.040 --> 25:25.360
 which is what a Wikipedia article would actually try to do,

25:25.360 --> 25:27.440
 which is like, what does this mean

25:27.440 --> 25:29.920
 in the context of computer,

25:29.920 --> 25:32.240
 the broad field of computer vision or something like that?

25:32.240 --> 25:34.640
 Yeah, yeah, and no, I agree with you completely,

25:34.640 --> 25:35.920
 but it depends on the topic.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.320
 I mean, for some topics, there's been a huge amount of work.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.240
 For other topics, it's just a stub.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.440
 So, you know.

25:41.440 --> 25:41.920
 I got it.

25:41.920 --> 25:42.400
 Yeah.

25:42.400 --> 25:47.920
 Well, yeah, actually, which we'll talk on, genomics was not great.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.200
 Yeah, it's very shallow.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.680
 Yeah, it's not wrong, it's just shallow.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.240
 It's shallow.

25:52.240 --> 25:52.880
 Yeah.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.560
 Every time I criticize something,

25:54.560 --> 25:56.160
 I should feel partly responsible.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.640
 Basically, if more people from my community went there

25:58.640 --> 26:00.960
 and edited, it would not be shallow.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.840
 It's just that there's different modes of communication

26:03.840 --> 26:05.120
 in different fields.

26:05.120 --> 26:08.800
 And in some fields, the experts have embraced Wikipedia.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.040
 In other fields, it's relegated.

26:11.040 --> 26:16.400
 And perhaps the reason is that if it was any better to start with,

26:16.400 --> 26:17.920
 people would invest more time.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.840
 But if it's not great to start with,

26:19.840 --> 26:23.040
 then you need a few initial pioneers who will basically go in

26:23.040 --> 26:26.480
 and say, enough, we're just going to fix that.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.160
 And then I think it'll catch on much more.

26:28.960 --> 26:32.080
 So, if it's okay before we go on to genomics,

26:32.080 --> 26:36.240
 can we linger a little bit longer on the beauty of the human genome?

26:36.960 --> 26:38.480
 You've given me a few notes.

26:38.480 --> 26:41.520
 What else do you find beautiful about the human genome?

26:41.520 --> 26:44.800
 So, the last aspect of what makes the human genome unique,

26:44.800 --> 26:49.840
 in addition to the similarity and the differences

26:49.840 --> 26:55.200
 and the individuality, is that very early on,

26:56.160 --> 26:59.040
 people would basically say, oh, you don't do that experiment in human.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.040
 You have to learn about that in fly.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.960
 Or you have to learn about that in yeast first,

27:02.960 --> 27:05.120
 or in mouse first, or in a primate first.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.760
 And the human genome was in fact relegated to all the last place

27:09.760 --> 27:11.760
 that you're going to go to learn something new.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.080
 That has dramatically changed.

27:14.080 --> 27:17.120
 And the reason that changed is human genetics.

27:18.560 --> 27:23.760
 We are these species in the planet that's the most studied right now.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.080
 It's embarrassing to say that.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.160
 But this was not the case a few years ago.

27:28.160 --> 27:35.120
 It used to be first viruses, then bacteria, then yeast,

27:35.120 --> 27:38.800
 then the fruit fly and the worm, then the mouse.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.600
 And eventually, human was very far last.

27:42.240 --> 27:45.280
 So, it's embarrassing that it took us this long to focus on it?

27:46.480 --> 27:50.320
 It's embarrassing that the model organisms have been taken over

27:50.320 --> 27:51.920
 because of the power of human genetics.

27:52.560 --> 27:57.200
 That right now, it's actually simpler to figure out the phenotype of something

27:57.200 --> 28:00.640
 by mining this massive amount of human data

28:01.200 --> 28:03.840
 than by going back to any of the other species.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.640
 And the reason for that is that if you look at the natural variation

28:06.640 --> 28:08.640
 that happens in a population of 7 billion,

28:09.520 --> 28:12.480
 you basically have a mutation in almost every nucleotide.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.520
 So, every nucleotide you want to perturb,

28:15.520 --> 28:18.640
 you can go find a living, breathing human being

28:18.640 --> 28:20.160
 and go test the function of that nucleotide

28:20.160 --> 28:22.400
 by sort of searching the database and finding that person.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.440
 Wait, why is that embarrassing?

28:23.440 --> 28:24.400
 It's a beautiful data set.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.240
 It's huge for humans.

28:26.240 --> 28:29.200
 It's embarrassing for the model organism.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.000
 For the flies.

28:30.000 --> 28:30.960
 Yeah, exactly.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.880
 I mean, do you feel on a small tangent,

28:34.880 --> 28:39.920
 is there something of value in the genome of a fly

28:39.920 --> 28:43.600
 and other of these model organisms that you miss

28:43.600 --> 28:47.360
 that we wish we would be looking at deeper?

28:47.360 --> 28:49.760
 So, directed perturbation, of course.

28:49.760 --> 28:54.000
 So, I think the place where humans are still lagging

28:54.000 --> 28:56.320
 is the fact that in an animal model, you can go and say,

28:56.320 --> 28:58.480
 well, let me knock out this gene completely.

28:58.480 --> 29:00.480
 And let me knock out these three genes completely.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.640
 And the moment you get into combinatorics,

29:02.640 --> 29:04.080
 it's something you can't do in the human

29:04.080 --> 29:06.400
 because there just simply aren't enough humans on the planet.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.800
 And again, let me be honest,

29:08.800 --> 29:11.040
 we haven't sequenced all 7 billion people.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.640
 It's not like we have every mutation,

29:12.640 --> 29:14.880
 but we know that there's a carrier out there.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.360
 So, if you look at the trend and the speed

29:17.360 --> 29:19.360
 with which human genetics has progressed,

29:19.360 --> 29:23.200
 we can now find thousands of genes involved

29:23.200 --> 29:26.320
 in human cognition, in human psychology,

29:27.040 --> 29:28.960
 in the emotions and the feelings

29:28.960 --> 29:31.600
 that we used to think are uniquely learned.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.680
 Turns out there's a genetic basis to a lot of that.

29:34.320 --> 29:41.680
 So, the human genome has continued to elucidate

29:42.480 --> 29:44.800
 through these studies of genetic variation,

29:44.800 --> 29:46.160
 so many different processes

29:46.160 --> 29:51.680
 that we previously thought were something like free will.

29:51.680 --> 29:54.240
 Free will is this beautiful concept

29:54.240 --> 29:56.480
 that humans have had for a long time.

29:57.760 --> 29:58.480
 You know, in the end,

29:58.480 --> 29:59.840
 it's just a bunch of chemical reactions

29:59.840 --> 30:00.720
 happening in your brain.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.120
 And the particular abundance of receptors

30:03.120 --> 30:06.080
 that you have this day based on what you ate yesterday

30:06.080 --> 30:08.400
 or that you have been wired with

30:08.400 --> 30:11.840
 based on your parents and your upbringing, etc.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.400
 Determines a lot of that, quote unquote,

30:14.400 --> 30:21.680
 free will component to sort of narrower slices.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.280
 So, how much on that point,

30:23.280 --> 30:24.960
 how much freedom do you think we have

30:25.600 --> 30:29.600
 to escape the constraints of our genome?

30:30.480 --> 30:31.840
 You're making it sound like more and more

30:31.840 --> 30:33.280
 we're discovering that our genome

30:33.280 --> 30:37.600
 is actually has a lot of the story already encoded into it.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.800
 How much freedom do we have?

30:38.800 --> 30:44.960
 So, let me describe what that freedom would look like.

30:44.960 --> 30:47.520
 That freedom would be my saying,

30:47.520 --> 30:50.880
 oh, I'm going to resist the urge to eat that apple

30:51.520 --> 30:53.040
 because I choose not to.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.320
 But there are chemical receptors

30:56.320 --> 30:58.720
 that made me not resist the urge

30:59.280 --> 31:02.160
 to prove my individuality and my free will

31:02.160 --> 31:03.280
 by resisting the apple.

31:03.920 --> 31:05.520
 So then the next question is,

31:05.520 --> 31:08.080
 well, maybe now I'll resist the urge to resist the apple

31:08.080 --> 31:09.440
 and I'll go for the chocolate instead

31:09.440 --> 31:10.640
 to prove my individuality.

31:10.640 --> 31:14.160
 But then what about those other receptors that, you know...

31:15.840 --> 31:17.680
 That might be all encoded in there.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.360
 So, it's kicking the bucket down the road

31:19.360 --> 31:21.360
 and basically saying, well, your choice

31:22.000 --> 31:23.680
 will may have actually been driven

31:23.680 --> 31:26.240
 by other things that you actually are not choosing.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.920
 So, that's why it's very hard to answer that question.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.280
 It's hard to know what to do with that.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.960
 I mean, if the genome has...

31:32.960 --> 31:40.400
 If there's not much freedom, it's the butterfly effect.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.320
 It's basically that in the short term,

31:42.880 --> 31:45.600
 you can predict something extremely well

31:45.600 --> 31:47.280
 by knowing the current state of the system.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.520
 But a few steps down,

31:49.520 --> 31:51.760
 it's very hard to predict based on the current knowledge.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.480
 Is that because the system is truly free?

31:55.040 --> 31:56.240
 When I look at weather patterns,

31:56.240 --> 31:57.680
 I can predict the next 10 days.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.080
 Is it because the weather has a lot of freedom

32:00.080 --> 32:01.280
 and after 10 days,

32:01.280 --> 32:03.280
 it chooses to do something else?

32:03.280 --> 32:06.240
 Or is it because, in fact, the system is fully deterministic?

32:07.280 --> 32:10.480
 And there's just a slightly different magnetic field of the earth,

32:10.480 --> 32:12.240
 slightly more energy arriving from the sun,

32:12.240 --> 32:15.920
 a slightly different spin of the gravitational pull of Jupiter

32:15.920 --> 32:18.720
 that is now causing all kinds of tides

32:18.720 --> 32:20.720
 and slight deviation of the moon, etc.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.320
 Maybe all of that can be fully modeled.

32:22.880 --> 32:27.120
 Maybe the fact that China is emitting a little more carbon today

32:27.120 --> 32:31.360
 is actually going to affect the weather in Egypt in three weeks.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.120
 And all of that could be fully modeled.

32:33.760 --> 32:34.960
 In the same way,

32:34.960 --> 32:38.320
 if you take a complete view of a human being now,

32:39.440 --> 32:40.960
 I model everything about you,

32:42.720 --> 32:44.800
 the question is, can I predict your next step?

32:44.800 --> 32:45.360
 Probably.

32:46.320 --> 32:47.680
 But at how far?

32:47.680 --> 32:49.360
 And if it's a little further,

32:49.360 --> 32:51.280
 is that because of stochasticity

32:51.280 --> 32:54.480
 and sort of chaos properties of unpredictability

32:54.480 --> 32:56.000
 of beyond a certain level?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.680
 Or was that actually true free will?

32:58.240 --> 33:01.280
 Yeah, so the number of variables might be so.

33:01.280 --> 33:05.120
 You might need to build an entire universe to be able to model.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.560
 To simulate a human.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.800
 And then maybe that human will be fully simulatable.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.080
 But maybe aspects of free will will exist.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.280
 And where's that free will coming from?

33:13.280 --> 33:14.800
 It's still coming from the same neurons,

33:14.800 --> 33:17.440
 or maybe from a spirit inhabiting these neurons.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.600
 But again, it's very difficult empirically

33:19.600 --> 33:22.400
 to sort of evaluate where does free will begin

33:22.400 --> 33:26.720
 and sort of chemical reactions and electric signals and, you know, and...

33:26.720 --> 33:29.680
 So on that topic, let me ask the most absurd question

33:31.120 --> 33:33.840
 that most MIT faculty roll their eyes on.

33:33.840 --> 33:38.160
 But what do you think about the simulation hypothesis

33:38.160 --> 33:40.080
 and the idea that we live in a simulation?

33:40.080 --> 33:41.280
 I think it's completely BS.

33:43.840 --> 33:44.320
 Okay.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.600
 There's no empirical evidence.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.080
 No, it's not.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.120
 Absolutely not.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.640
 Not in terms of empirical evidence,

33:48.640 --> 33:52.240
 not but in terms of thought experiment.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.080
 Does it help you think about the universe?

33:54.720 --> 33:57.360
 I mean, so if you look at the genome,

33:57.360 --> 33:59.040
 it's encoding a lot of the information

33:59.040 --> 34:02.320
 that is required to create some of the beautiful human complexity

34:02.320 --> 34:03.280
 that we see around this.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.920
 It's an interesting thought experiment.

34:05.920 --> 34:11.200
 How much, you know, parameters do we need to have

34:11.200 --> 34:15.120
 in order to model some, you know, this full human experience?

34:15.120 --> 34:16.720
 Like if we were to build a video game,

34:16.720 --> 34:19.840
 yeah, how hard it would be to build a video game

34:19.840 --> 34:23.520
 that's like convincing enough and fun enough and, you know,

34:24.880 --> 34:28.160
 it has consistent laws of physics, all that stuff.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.160
 It's not interesting to use a thought experiment.

34:31.200 --> 34:34.880
 I mean, it's cute, but, you know, it's Occam's razor.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.640
 I mean, what's more realistic,

34:36.640 --> 34:38.160
 the fact that you're actually a machine

34:38.160 --> 34:39.600
 or that you're, you know, a person?

34:39.600 --> 34:43.200
 What's, you know, the fact that all of my experiences exist

34:43.200 --> 34:45.440
 inside the chemical molecules that I have

34:45.440 --> 34:48.480
 or that somebody's actually, you know, same lading all that.

34:49.360 --> 34:52.080
 Well, you did refer to humans as a digital computer earlier.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.000
 Of course, of course, but that does not...

34:54.000 --> 34:55.200
 It's kind of a machine, right?

34:55.200 --> 34:56.240
 I know, I know.

34:56.240 --> 35:01.680
 But I think the probability of all that is nil

35:01.680 --> 35:03.360
 and let the machines wake me up

35:03.360 --> 35:05.280
 and just terminate me now if it's not.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.640
 I challenge you machines.

35:08.640 --> 35:12.320
 They're gonna wait a little bit to see what you're gonna do next.

35:12.320 --> 35:12.880
 It's fun.

35:12.880 --> 35:13.680
 It's fun to watch,

35:13.680 --> 35:15.920
 especially the clever humans.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.440
 What's the difference to you between the way

35:19.440 --> 35:21.280
 a computer stores information

35:21.280 --> 35:23.840
 and the human genome stores information?

35:23.840 --> 35:26.320
 So you also have roots and your work.

35:26.800 --> 35:27.600
 Would you say you're...

35:28.640 --> 35:30.240
 When you introduce yourself at a bar...

35:31.760 --> 35:32.960
 It depends who I'm talking to.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.000
 Would you say it's computation biology?

35:36.000 --> 35:42.480
 Do you reveal your expertise in computers?

35:42.480 --> 35:45.200
 It depends who I'm talking to, truly.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.600
 I mean, basically, if I meet someone who's in computers,

35:47.600 --> 35:50.160
 I'll say, oh, I mean, professor in computer science.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.320
 If I meet someone who's in engineering,

35:52.320 --> 35:54.080
 I say computer science and electrical engineering.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.040
 If I meet someone in biology, I'll say, hey, I work in genomics.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.640
 If I meet someone in medicine, I'm like, hey, I work on genetics.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.080
 You're a fun person to meet at a bar.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.760
 I got you, but so...

36:03.760 --> 36:06.720
 No, no, but what I'm trying to say is that I don't...

36:07.520 --> 36:10.320
 There's no single attribute that I will define myself as.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.920
 There's a few things I know.

36:11.920 --> 36:12.960
 There's a few things I study.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.880
 There's a few of the things I have degrees on,

36:14.880 --> 36:17.360
 and there's a few things that I grant degrees in.

36:17.920 --> 36:22.720
 And I publish papers across the whole gamut,

36:22.720 --> 36:26.240
 the whole spectrum of computation to biology, et cetera.

36:26.240 --> 36:31.360
 I mean, the complete answer is that I use computer science

36:31.360 --> 36:32.640
 to understand biology.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.840
 So I'm a developed methods in AI and machine learning statistics

36:39.840 --> 36:41.440
 and algorithms, et cetera.

36:41.440 --> 36:45.520
 But the ultimate goal of my career is to really understand biology.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.640
 If these things don't advance our understanding of biology,

36:49.440 --> 36:51.840
 I'm not as fascinated by them.

36:51.840 --> 36:55.440
 Although there are some beautiful computational problems by themselves,

36:56.320 --> 37:01.440
 I've sort of made it my mission to apply the power of computer science

37:01.440 --> 37:06.000
 to truly understand the human genome, health, disease,

37:06.000 --> 37:09.120
 you know, and the whole gamut of how our brain works,

37:09.120 --> 37:12.960
 our body works, and all of that, which is so fascinating.

37:12.960 --> 37:18.800
 So there's not an equivalent sort of complementary dream

37:18.800 --> 37:22.400
 of understanding human biology in order to create an artificial life,

37:22.400 --> 37:25.120
 an artificial brain, an artificial intelligence

37:25.120 --> 37:28.720
 that supersedes the intelligence and the capabilities of us humans.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.120
 It's an interesting question.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.240
 It's a fascinating question.

37:32.240 --> 37:39.600
 So understanding the human brain is undoubtedly coupled

37:39.600 --> 37:41.520
 to how do we make better AI?

37:42.080 --> 37:47.120
 Because so much of AI has, in fact, been inspired by the brain.

37:47.120 --> 37:50.960
 It may have taken 50 years since the early days of neural networks

37:50.960 --> 37:54.720
 till we have, you know, all of these amazing progress

37:54.720 --> 38:02.800
 that we've seen with, you know, deep belief networks and, you know,

38:02.800 --> 38:08.400
 all of these advances in go and chess, in image synthesis,

38:08.400 --> 38:10.160
 in deep fakes, in you name it.

38:11.840 --> 38:15.280
 And but the underlying architecture

38:15.280 --> 38:17.920
 is very much inspired by the human brain,

38:17.920 --> 38:20.560
 which actually posits a very, very interesting question.

38:20.560 --> 38:26.080
 Why are neural networks performing so well?

38:27.040 --> 38:28.880
 And they perform amazingly well.

38:28.880 --> 38:31.360
 Is it because they can simulate any possible function?

38:32.400 --> 38:36.080
 And the answer is no, no, they simulate a very small number of functions.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.360
 Is it because they can simulate every functional function

38:39.360 --> 38:40.400
 in the universe?

38:40.400 --> 38:41.440
 And that's where it gets interesting.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.920
 The answer is actually, yeah, a little closer to that.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.160
 And here's where it gets really fun.

38:46.160 --> 38:51.600
 If you look at human brain and human cognition,

38:51.600 --> 38:53.280
 it didn't evolve in a vacuum.

38:53.840 --> 38:57.200
 It evolved in a world with physical constraints,

38:58.720 --> 39:00.560
 like the world that inhabits us.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.000
 It is the world that we inhabit.

39:03.120 --> 39:08.080
 And if you look at our senses, what do they perceive?

39:08.080 --> 39:11.760
 They perceive different, you know, parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

39:11.760 --> 39:17.760
 You know, the hearing is just different movements in air, the touch, et cetera.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.720
 I mean, all of these things, we've built intuitions

39:20.720 --> 39:22.480
 for the physical world that we inhabit.

39:23.120 --> 39:27.680
 And our brains and the brains of all animals evolved for that world.

39:27.680 --> 39:33.520
 And the AI systems that we have built happen to work well with images

39:33.520 --> 39:36.240
 of the type that we encounter in the physical world that we inhabit.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.560
 Whereas if you just take noise and you add random signal

39:40.560 --> 39:44.160
 that doesn't match anything in our world, neural networks will not do as well.

39:44.960 --> 39:50.800
 And that actually basically has this whole loop around this,

39:50.800 --> 39:55.360
 which is this was designed by studying our own brain,

39:55.360 --> 39:57.680
 which was evolved for our own world,

39:57.680 --> 39:59.920
 and they happen to do well in our own world.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.920
 And they happen to make the same types of mistakes

40:01.920 --> 40:04.640
 that humans make many, many times.

40:04.640 --> 40:08.240
 And of course, you can engineer images by adding just the right amount of,

40:08.240 --> 40:11.920
 you know, sort of pixel deviations to make a zebra look like a bamboo

40:11.920 --> 40:14.720
 and stuff like that, or like a table.

40:16.080 --> 40:23.040
 But ultimately, the undocked images at least are very often, you know, mistaken,

40:23.040 --> 40:26.160
 I don't know, between muffins and dogs, for example,

40:26.160 --> 40:28.720
 in the same way that humans make those mistakes.

40:28.720 --> 40:34.640
 So it's, you know, there's no doubt in my view that the more we understand

40:34.640 --> 40:37.440
 about the tricks that our human brain has evolved

40:37.440 --> 40:39.600
 to understand the physical world around us,

40:39.600 --> 40:45.520
 the more we will be able to bring new computational primitives in our AI systems

40:45.520 --> 40:49.040
 to, again, better understand not just the world around us,

40:49.040 --> 40:51.440
 but maybe even the world inside us,

40:51.440 --> 40:55.360
 and maybe even the computational problems that arise from new types of data

40:55.360 --> 40:57.040
 that we haven't seen in the past.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.240
 It's from new types of data that we haven't been exposed to,

41:00.240 --> 41:03.360
 but are yet inhabiting the same universe that we live in

41:03.360 --> 41:06.000
 with the very tiny little subset of functions

41:06.000 --> 41:08.080
 from all possible mathematical functions.

41:08.080 --> 41:11.600
 Yeah, and that small subset of functions, all that matters to us humans, really.

41:11.600 --> 41:12.800
 That's what makes...

41:12.800 --> 41:17.120
 It's all that has mattered so far, and even within our scientific realm,

41:17.120 --> 41:19.040
 it's all that seems to continue to matter.

41:19.760 --> 41:24.000
 But, I mean, I always like to think about our senses

41:24.000 --> 41:28.400
 and how much of the physical world around us we perceive.

41:28.960 --> 41:35.920
 And if you look at the LIGO experiment of the last year and a half,

41:35.920 --> 41:38.720
 has been all over the news, what did LIGO do?

41:38.720 --> 41:42.160
 It created a new sense for human beings,

41:42.160 --> 41:46.320
 a sense that has never been sensed in the history of our planet.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.800
 Gravitational waves have been traversing the Earth

41:50.800 --> 41:53.040
 since its creation a few billion years ago.

41:54.240 --> 42:00.080
 Life has evolved senses to sense things that were never before sensed.

42:01.200 --> 42:04.400
 Light was not perceived by early life.

42:04.400 --> 42:05.520
 No one cared.

42:06.400 --> 42:09.440
 And eventually, photoreceptors evolved,

42:10.080 --> 42:14.800
 and the ability to sense colors by sort of catching different parts

42:14.800 --> 42:17.040
 of that electromagnetic spectrum.

42:17.040 --> 42:20.480
 And hearing evolved, and touch evolved, et cetera.

42:21.040 --> 42:24.720
 But no organism evolved a way to sense neutrinos

42:24.720 --> 42:27.040
 floating through Earth, or gravitational waves

42:27.040 --> 42:28.560
 flowing through Earth, et cetera.

42:28.560 --> 42:32.000
 And I find it so beautiful in the history of not just humanity,

42:32.000 --> 42:33.840
 but life on the planet,

42:33.840 --> 42:37.280
 that we are now able to capture additional signals

42:37.280 --> 42:39.760
 from the physical world than we ever knew before.

42:40.560 --> 42:44.480
 And axioms, for example, have been all over the news in the last few weeks.

42:44.480 --> 42:51.120
 The concept that we can capture and perceive more of that physical world

42:52.000 --> 42:59.680
 is as exciting as the fact that we were blind to it is traumatizing before.

42:59.680 --> 43:04.080
 Because that also tells us, we're in 2020.

43:05.040 --> 43:08.560
 Picture yourself in 30, 20, or in 20, you know.

43:08.560 --> 43:10.560
 What new senses might we have?

43:10.560 --> 43:16.480
 Is it, you know, could it be that we're missing nine tenths of physics?

43:16.480 --> 43:16.960
 Yeah.

43:16.960 --> 43:20.320
 That there's a lot of physics out there that we're just blind to,

43:20.320 --> 43:24.160
 completely oblivious to it, and yet they're permeating us all the time.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.840
 Yeah, so it might be right in front of us.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.200
 So when you're thinking about premonitions,

43:29.840 --> 43:32.320
 yeah, a lot of that is ascertainment bias.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.080
 Like, yeah, every now and then you're like,

43:34.080 --> 43:35.680
 oh, I remember my friend,

43:35.680 --> 43:37.760
 and you're like, oh, I remember my friend,

43:37.760 --> 43:40.160
 and you're like, oh, I remember my friend,

43:40.160 --> 43:42.000
 and then my friend doesn't appear,

43:42.000 --> 43:43.760
 and I'll forget that I remembered my friend.

43:43.760 --> 43:45.360
 But every now and then my friend will actually appear,

43:45.360 --> 43:47.600
 and I'm like, oh, my God, I thought about you a minute ago,

43:47.600 --> 43:49.120
 you just called me, that's amazing.

43:49.120 --> 43:51.200
 So, you know, some of that is this,

43:51.200 --> 43:55.280
 but some of that might be that there are, within our brain,

43:56.160 --> 44:01.280
 sensors for waves that we emit that we're not even aware of.

44:02.560 --> 44:06.160
 And this whole concept of when I hug my children,

44:06.160 --> 44:10.320
 there's such an emotional transfer there

44:10.320 --> 44:11.520
 that we don't comprehend.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.440
 I mean, sure, yeah, of course,

44:13.440 --> 44:16.560
 we're all like hard wire for all kinds of touchy feely things

44:16.560 --> 44:18.080
 between parents and kids, it's beautiful,

44:18.080 --> 44:19.760
 between partners, it's beautiful, et cetera.

44:20.560 --> 44:26.400
 But then there are intangible aspects of human communication

44:27.280 --> 44:29.840
 that I don't think it's unfathomable

44:29.840 --> 44:32.640
 that our brain has actually evolved ways and sensors for it

44:32.640 --> 44:33.840
 that we just don't capture.

44:33.840 --> 44:35.120
 We don't understand the function

44:35.120 --> 44:36.720
 of the vast majority of our neurons.

44:37.440 --> 44:40.000
 And maybe our brain is already sensing it,

44:40.000 --> 44:43.840
 but even worse, maybe our brain is not sensing it at all.

44:43.840 --> 44:46.480
 And we're oblivious to this until we build a machine

44:46.480 --> 44:48.240
 that suddenly is able to sort of capture

44:48.240 --> 44:50.160
 so much more of what's happening in the natural world.

44:50.160 --> 44:52.160
 So what you're saying is we're going,

44:52.160 --> 44:54.400
 physics is going to discover a sensor for love.

44:57.120 --> 45:00.000
 And maybe dogs are off scale for that.

45:01.360 --> 45:02.480
 And we've been, you know,

45:02.480 --> 45:03.920
 we've been oblivious to it the whole time

45:03.920 --> 45:05.600
 because we didn't have the right sensor.

45:05.600 --> 45:07.280
 And now you're going to have a little wrist that says,

45:07.280 --> 45:09.520
 oh my God, I feel all this love in the house.

45:09.520 --> 45:11.520
 I sense these turbines in the forest.

45:12.640 --> 45:13.520
 It's all around us.

45:13.520 --> 45:15.680
 And dogs and cats will have zero.

45:15.680 --> 45:16.480
 None, none.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.040
 None, none.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.000
 It's just, nothing lost.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.640
 But let's take a step back to our unfortunate place.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.640
 One of the 400 topics that we had actually planned for.

45:28.880 --> 45:31.680
 Yeah, but to our sad time in 2020

45:31.680 --> 45:33.840
 when we only have just a few sensors and

45:34.640 --> 45:36.960
 very primitive early computers.

45:37.520 --> 45:41.680
 So in your, you have a foot in computer science

45:41.680 --> 45:43.360
 and a foot in biology.

45:43.360 --> 45:48.160
 In your sense, how do computers represent information

45:48.160 --> 45:51.280
 differently than like the genome or biological systems?

45:52.160 --> 45:55.760
 So first of all, let me correct that,

45:55.760 --> 45:57.920
 no, we're in an amazing time in 2020.

45:57.920 --> 46:02.400
 Computer science is totally awesome.

46:02.400 --> 46:03.840
 And physics is totally awesome.

46:03.840 --> 46:06.800
 And we have understood so much of the natural world

46:06.800 --> 46:07.840
 than ever before.

46:08.400 --> 46:13.040
 So I am extremely grateful and feeling extremely lucky

46:13.040 --> 46:15.360
 to be living the time that we are.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.440
 Because, you know, first of all,

46:17.440 --> 46:19.520
 who knows when the asteroid will hit?

46:21.760 --> 46:26.000
 And second, you know, of all times in humanity,

46:26.000 --> 46:29.280
 this is probably the best time to be a human being.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.960
 And this might actually be the best place

46:30.960 --> 46:31.680
 to be a human being.

46:31.680 --> 46:34.320
 So anyway, you know, for anyone who loves science,

46:34.320 --> 46:35.120
 this is, this is it.

46:35.120 --> 46:35.680
 This is awesome.

46:35.680 --> 46:36.800
 It's a great time.

46:36.800 --> 46:39.280
 At the same time, just a quick comment.

46:39.280 --> 46:43.520
 All I meant is that if we look several hundred years from now

46:43.520 --> 46:47.760
 and we end up somehow not destroying ourselves,

46:48.400 --> 46:50.240
 people will probably look back at this time

46:50.240 --> 46:54.960
 in computer science and at your work of Manos at MIT.

46:54.960 --> 46:56.480
 In fontile.

46:56.480 --> 46:59.520
 In fontile and silly and how ignorant it all was.

46:59.520 --> 47:02.400
 I like to joke very often with my students

47:02.400 --> 47:04.080
 that, you know, we've written so many papers.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.120
 We've published so much.

47:05.120 --> 47:06.400
 We've been citing so much.

47:06.400 --> 47:08.000
 And every single time I tell my students,

47:08.000 --> 47:09.600
 you know, the best is ahead of us.

47:09.600 --> 47:12.320
 What we're working on now is the most exciting thing

47:12.320 --> 47:13.760
 I've ever worked on.

47:13.760 --> 47:16.080
 So in a way, I do have this sense of,

47:16.080 --> 47:17.840
 yeah, even the papers I wrote 10 years ago,

47:18.400 --> 47:20.160
 they were awesome at the time.

47:20.160 --> 47:22.320
 But I'm so much more excited about where we're heading now.

47:22.320 --> 47:23.680
 And I don't mean to minimize

47:23.680 --> 47:25.360
 any of the stuff we've done in the past,

47:25.360 --> 47:28.880
 but, you know, there's just this sense of excitement

47:28.880 --> 47:30.240
 about what you're working on now

47:30.960 --> 47:32.640
 that as soon as a paper is submitted,

47:33.200 --> 47:35.040
 it's like, oh, it's old.

47:35.040 --> 47:36.960
 Like, you know, I can't talk about that anymore.

47:36.960 --> 47:38.560
 At the same time, you're not,

47:38.560 --> 47:40.720
 you probably are not going to be able to predict

47:41.360 --> 47:44.800
 what are the most impactful papers and ideas.

47:45.360 --> 47:47.760
 When people look back 200 years from now at your work,

47:47.760 --> 47:50.560
 what would be the most exciting papers?

47:50.560 --> 47:57.120
 And it may very well be not the thing that you expected, or the things you got awards for,

47:57.120 --> 47:57.920
 or, you know.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.280
 This might be true in some fields.

47:59.840 --> 48:00.240
 I don't know.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.240
 I feel slightly differently about it in our field.

48:02.240 --> 48:05.600
 I feel that I kind of know what are the important ones.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.200
 And there's a very big difference

48:07.200 --> 48:09.120
 between what the press picks up on

48:09.120 --> 48:11.520
 and what's actually fundamentally important for the field.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.280
 And I think for the fundamentally important ones,

48:13.280 --> 48:15.520
 we kind of have a pretty good idea what they are.

48:15.520 --> 48:18.080
 And it's hard to sometimes get the press excited

48:18.080 --> 48:19.520
 about the fundamental advances.

48:19.520 --> 48:24.720
 But, you know, we take what we get and celebrate what we get.

48:24.720 --> 48:27.120
 And sometimes, you know, one of our papers,

48:27.120 --> 48:30.160
 which was in a minor journal, made the front page of Reddit

48:30.160 --> 48:32.640
 and suddenly had like hundreds of thousands of views.

48:33.360 --> 48:34.960
 Even though it was in a minor journal,

48:34.960 --> 48:36.960
 because, you know, somebody pitched it the right way

48:36.960 --> 48:38.640
 that it suddenly caught everybody's attention.

48:39.200 --> 48:42.160
 Whereas other papers that are sort of truly fundamental,

48:42.160 --> 48:45.520
 you know, we have a hard time getting the editors even excited about them.

48:46.080 --> 48:49.120
 When so many hundreds of people are already using the results

48:49.120 --> 48:50.080
 and building upon them.

48:50.880 --> 48:54.320
 So I do appreciate that there's a discrepancy

48:54.320 --> 48:57.360
 between the perception and the perceived success

48:57.360 --> 48:59.360
 and the awards that you get for various papers.

48:59.360 --> 49:02.960
 But I think that fundamentally I know that, you know, some paper.

49:02.960 --> 49:06.080
 I'm so, so when you're right, you're most proud.

49:06.720 --> 49:09.280
 See now you just, you trapped yourself.

49:09.280 --> 49:12.400
 No, no, no, no, I mean, is there a line of work that you've,

49:12.400 --> 49:16.880
 you have a sense is really powerful that you've done the day.

49:16.880 --> 49:19.440
 You've done so much work in so many directions,

49:19.440 --> 49:20.320
 which is interesting.

49:21.120 --> 49:24.000
 Is there something where you think is quite special?

49:24.640 --> 49:29.520
 I mean, it's like asking me to say which of my three children I love best.

49:29.520 --> 49:30.080
 I mean,

49:33.520 --> 49:34.000
 Exactly.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.320
 So, I mean, and it's such a gimme question that is so,

49:39.760 --> 49:43.360
 so difficult not to brag about the awesome work

49:43.360 --> 49:45.200
 that my team and my students have done.

49:45.200 --> 49:48.080
 And I'll just mention a few off the top of my head.

49:48.080 --> 49:51.120
 I mean, basically there's a few landmark papers

49:51.120 --> 49:54.480
 that I think have shaped my scientific path.

49:54.480 --> 50:00.160
 And, you know, I like to somehow describe it as a linear continuation

50:00.160 --> 50:03.280
 of one thing led to another and led to another led to another.

50:03.280 --> 50:10.320
 And, you know, it kind of all started with skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

50:10.320 --> 50:12.080
 Let me try to start somewhere in the middle.

50:12.080 --> 50:17.600
 So, my first PhD paper was the first comparative analysis

50:17.600 --> 50:20.640
 of multiple species, so multiple complete genomes.

50:20.640 --> 50:24.400
 So for the first time, we basically developed a concept

50:24.400 --> 50:26.960
 of genome wide evolutionary signatures,

50:26.960 --> 50:29.600
 the fact that you could look across the entire genome

50:29.600 --> 50:32.160
 and understand how things evolve.

50:32.160 --> 50:36.400
 And from these signatures of evolution, you could go back

50:36.400 --> 50:38.960
 and study any one region and say,

50:38.960 --> 50:42.080
 that's a protein coding gene, that's an RNA gene,

50:42.080 --> 50:45.680
 that's a regulatory motif, that's a, you know, binding site,

50:45.680 --> 50:46.880
 and so on and so forth.

50:46.880 --> 50:51.440
 So, I'm sorry, so comparing different species of the same.

50:51.440 --> 50:54.800
 So, so the human mouse, rat and dog, you know,

50:54.800 --> 50:56.640
 they're all animals, they're all mammals,

50:56.640 --> 50:59.520
 they're all performing similar functions with their heart,

50:59.520 --> 51:02.560
 with their brain, with their lungs, et cetera, et cetera.

51:02.560 --> 51:05.760
 So, there's many functional elements that make us

51:05.760 --> 51:09.280
 uniquely mammalian, and those mammalian elements

51:09.280 --> 51:11.280
 are actually conserved.

51:11.280 --> 51:15.440
 99% of our genome does not code for protein.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.440
 1% codes for protein.

51:17.440 --> 51:21.920
 The other 99%, we frankly didn't know what it does

51:21.920 --> 51:24.880
 until we started doing these comparative genomic studies.

51:24.880 --> 51:28.880
 So basically, these series of papers in my career

51:28.880 --> 51:31.440
 have basically first developed that concept

51:31.440 --> 51:32.960
 of evolutionary signatures,

51:32.960 --> 51:36.000
 and then apply them to yeast, apply them to flies,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.880
 apply them to four mammals, apply them to 17 fungi,

51:38.880 --> 51:40.880
 apply them to 12 susophila species,

51:40.880 --> 51:43.840
 apply them to then 29 mammals, and now 200 mammals.

51:43.840 --> 51:47.840
 So, sorry, so can we, so the evolutionary signatures,

51:47.840 --> 51:50.640
 it seems like a such a fascinating idea,

51:50.640 --> 51:54.640
 and we're probably gonna linger in your early PhD work

51:54.640 --> 52:00.640
 for two hours, but what is, how can you reveal something

52:00.640 --> 52:04.640
 interesting about the genome by looking at the multiple

52:04.640 --> 52:08.640
 species and looking at the evolutionary signatures?

52:08.640 --> 52:14.640
 Yeah, so you basically align the matching regions.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.640
 So, everything evolved from a common ancestor,

52:16.640 --> 52:19.680
 way, way back, and mammals evolved from a common ancestor

52:19.680 --> 52:21.680
 about 60 million years back.

52:21.680 --> 52:26.640
 So, after, you know, the evolution of the evolution

52:26.640 --> 52:30.640
 of the dinosaurs about 50 million years back,

52:30.640 --> 52:36.640
 so after, you know, the meteor that killed off the dinosaurs,

52:36.640 --> 52:40.640
 landed near Machu Picchu, we know the crater,

52:40.640 --> 52:42.640
 it didn't allegedly land.

52:42.640 --> 52:44.640
 That was the aliens, okay.

52:44.640 --> 52:46.640
 No, just slightly north of Machu Picchu,

52:46.640 --> 52:50.640
 in the Gulf of Mexico, there's a giant hole that,

52:50.640 --> 52:52.640
 that meteor impact.

52:52.640 --> 52:54.640
 By the way, is that definitive?

52:54.640 --> 52:58.160
 really figured out what killed the dinosaurs?

52:58.160 --> 52:59.160
 I think so.

52:59.160 --> 53:00.760
 So it was a meteor?

53:00.760 --> 53:08.400
 Well, you know, volcanic activity, all kinds of other stuff is coinciding, but the meteor

53:08.400 --> 53:09.880
 is pretty unique and we now have...

53:09.880 --> 53:13.360
 That's also terrifying.

53:13.360 --> 53:15.720
 We still have a lot of 2020 left, so if anything...

53:15.720 --> 53:17.400
 No, no, but think about it this way.

53:17.400 --> 53:24.640
 So the dinosaurs ruled the Earth for 175 million years.

53:24.640 --> 53:30.920
 We humans have been around for, what, less than one million years, if you're super generous

53:30.920 --> 53:35.560
 about what you call humans, and you include chimps basically.

53:35.560 --> 53:42.520
 So we are just getting warmed up, and you know, we've ruled the planet much more ruthlessly

53:42.520 --> 53:46.320
 than Tyrannosaurus rex.

53:46.320 --> 53:50.040
 Tyrannosaurus rex had much less of an environmental impact than we did.

53:50.040 --> 53:56.760
 And if you give us another 174 million years, you know, humans will look very different

53:56.760 --> 53:58.480
 if we make it that far.

53:58.480 --> 54:05.400
 So I think dinosaurs basically are much more of life history on Earth than we are in all

54:05.400 --> 54:06.400
 respects.

54:06.400 --> 54:10.960
 But look at the bright side, when they were killed off, another life form emerged, mammals.

54:10.960 --> 54:15.160
 And that's that whole evolutionary branching that's happened.

54:15.160 --> 54:21.400
 So you kind of have, when you have these evolutionary signatures, is there basically a map of how

54:21.400 --> 54:23.640
 the genome changed throughout?

54:23.640 --> 54:28.840
 So now you can go back to this early mammal that was hiding in caves, and you can basically

54:28.840 --> 54:31.200
 ask what happened after the dinosaurs were wiped out.

54:31.200 --> 54:35.880
 A ton of evolutionary niches opened up, and the mammals started populating all of these

54:35.880 --> 54:37.800
 niches.

54:37.800 --> 54:44.920
 And in that diversification, there was room for expansion of new types of functions.

54:44.920 --> 54:53.600
 So some of them populated the air with bats flying, a new evolution of light.

54:53.600 --> 54:58.840
 Some populated the oceans with dolphins and whales going off to swim, et cetera.

54:58.840 --> 55:01.560
 But we all are fundamentally mammals.

55:01.560 --> 55:06.440
 So you can take the genomes of all these species and align them on top of each other.

55:06.440 --> 55:12.040
 And basically create nucleotide resolution correspondences.

55:12.040 --> 55:16.160
 What my PhD work showed is that when you do that, when you line up species on top of each

55:16.160 --> 55:21.960
 other, you can see that within protein coding genes, there's a particular pattern of evolution

55:21.960 --> 55:28.760
 that is dictated by the level at which evolutionary selection acts.

55:28.760 --> 55:35.320
 If I'm coding for a protein, and I change the third code on position of a triplet that

55:35.320 --> 55:39.880
 codes for that amino acid, the same amino acid will be encoded.

55:39.880 --> 55:46.920
 So that basically means that any kind of mutation that preserves that translation that is invariant

55:46.920 --> 55:53.320
 to that ultimate functional assessment that evolution will give is tolerated.

55:53.320 --> 55:57.160
 So for any function that you're trying to achieve, there's a set of sequences that

55:57.160 --> 55:58.640
 encode it.

55:58.640 --> 56:06.640
 You can now look at the mapping, the graph isomorphism, if you wish, between all of the

56:06.640 --> 56:10.560
 possible DNA encodings of a particular function and that function.

56:10.560 --> 56:15.200
 And instead of having just that exact sequence at the protein level, you can think of the

56:15.200 --> 56:18.840
 set of protein sequences that all fulfill the same function.

56:18.840 --> 56:20.440
 What's evolution doing?

56:20.440 --> 56:21.600
 Evolution has two components.

56:21.600 --> 56:26.080
 One component is random, blind, and stupid mutation.

56:26.080 --> 56:32.840
 The other component is super smart, ruthless selection.

56:32.840 --> 56:35.000
 That's my mom calling from Greece.

56:35.000 --> 56:40.720
 Yes, I might be a fully grown man, but I am a Greek.

56:40.720 --> 56:41.720
 Did you just cancel the call?

56:41.720 --> 56:42.720
 Wow, you're in trouble.

56:42.720 --> 56:43.720
 I know, I'm in trouble.

56:43.720 --> 56:44.720
 She's going to be calling the cops.

56:44.720 --> 56:51.720
 I'm going to edit this clip out and send it to her.

56:51.720 --> 56:54.960
 So there's a lot of encoding for the same kind of function.

56:54.960 --> 57:00.160
 So you now have this mapping between all of the set of functions that could all encode

57:00.160 --> 57:04.400
 the same, all of the set of sequences that can all encode the same function.

57:04.400 --> 57:10.360
 What evolutionary signatures does is that it basically looks at the shape of that distribution

57:10.360 --> 57:13.520
 of sequences that all encode the same thing.

57:13.520 --> 57:17.320
 And based on that shape, you can basically say, ooh, proteins have a very different

57:17.320 --> 57:21.400
 shape than RNA structures, than regulatory motifs, et cetera.

57:21.400 --> 57:25.560
 So just by scanning a sequence, ignoring the sequence, and just looking at the patterns

57:25.560 --> 57:30.840
 of change, I'm like, wow, this thing is evolving like a protein, and that thing is evolving

57:30.840 --> 57:33.260
 like a motif, and that thing is evolving.

57:33.260 --> 57:35.720
 So that's exactly what we just did for COVID.

57:35.720 --> 57:40.200
 So our paper that we posted in a bioarchive about coronavirus basically took this concept

57:40.200 --> 57:46.480
 of evolutionary signatures and applied it on the SARS CoV2 genome that is responsible

57:46.480 --> 57:48.760
 of the COVID 19 pandemic.

57:48.760 --> 57:52.520
 And comparing it to 44 Sarbacovirus species.

57:52.520 --> 57:53.520
 So this is the beta.

57:53.520 --> 57:56.360
 What word did you just use, Sarbacovirus?

57:56.360 --> 58:00.600
 Sarbacovirus, the SARS related beta coronavirus.

58:00.600 --> 58:01.600
 It's a portmanteau.

58:01.600 --> 58:03.400
 That's a family of viruses.

58:03.400 --> 58:04.400
 Yeah.

58:04.400 --> 58:05.400
 How big is that family, by the way?

58:05.400 --> 58:07.160
 We have 44 species that...

58:07.160 --> 58:09.880
 It's 44 species in the family.

58:09.880 --> 58:10.880
 Virus is a clever bunch.

58:10.880 --> 58:15.720
 No, no, but there's just 44, and again, we don't call them species in viruses.

58:15.720 --> 58:16.720
 We call them strains.

58:16.720 --> 58:22.280
 But anyway, there's 44 strains, and that's a tiny little subset of maybe another 50 strains

58:22.280 --> 58:24.800
 that are just far too distantly related.

58:24.800 --> 58:32.320
 Most of those only infect bats as the host, and a subset of only four or five have ever

58:32.320 --> 58:34.320
 infected humans.

58:34.320 --> 58:37.960
 And we basically took all of those, and we aligned them in the same exact way that we've

58:37.960 --> 58:38.960
 aligned mammals.

58:38.960 --> 58:42.520
 And then we looked at what proteins are...

58:42.520 --> 58:48.440
 Which of the currently hypothesized genes for the coronavirus genome are in fact evolving

58:48.440 --> 58:50.440
 like proteins, and which ones are not.

58:50.440 --> 58:55.040
 And what we found is that ORF10, the last little open reading frame, the last little

58:55.040 --> 58:57.160
 gene in the genome, is bogus.

58:57.160 --> 58:58.840
 That's not a protein at all.

58:58.840 --> 59:00.160
 What is it?

59:00.160 --> 59:02.080
 It's an RNA structure.

59:02.080 --> 59:03.680
 That doesn't have a...

59:03.680 --> 59:05.840
 It doesn't get translated into amino acids.

59:05.840 --> 59:06.840
 And that's...

59:06.840 --> 59:11.080
 So it's important to narrow down to basically discover what's useful and what's not.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.080
 Exactly.

59:12.080 --> 59:13.720
 Basically, what is even the set of genes?

59:13.720 --> 59:19.520
 The other thing that these evolutionary signatures showed is that within ORF3A, like a tiny little

59:19.520 --> 59:22.840
 additional gene encoded within the other gene.

59:22.840 --> 59:26.960
 So you can translate a DNA sequence in three different reading frames.

59:26.960 --> 59:30.160
 If you start in the first one, it's ATG, et cetera.

59:30.160 --> 59:33.400
 If you start on the second one, it's TGC, et cetera.

59:33.400 --> 59:36.760
 And there's a gene within a gene.

59:36.760 --> 59:41.360
 So there's a whole other protein that we didn't know about that might be super important.

59:41.360 --> 59:45.800
 So we don't even know the building blocks of SARS CoV2.

59:45.800 --> 59:50.800
 So if we want to understand coronavirus biology and eventually find it successfully, we need

59:50.800 --> 59:52.240
 to even have the set of genes.

59:52.240 --> 59:57.000
 And these evolutionary signatures that are developed in my PhD work, we just recently

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
 used.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
 You know what?

59:59.000 --> 1:00:01.640
 Let's run with that tangent for a little bit if it's okay.

1:00:01.640 --> 1:00:08.840
 Can we talk about the COVID 19 a little bit more?

1:00:08.840 --> 1:00:15.760
 What's your sense about the genome, the proteins, the functions that we understand about COVID

1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:16.760
 19?

1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:19.200
 Where do we stand in your sense?

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:21.600
 What are the big open problems?

1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:29.760
 And also, you kind of said it's important to understand what are the important proteins

1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:34.240
 and why is that important?

1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:39.520
 So what else does the comparison of these species tell us?

1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:43.080
 What it tells us is how fast are things evolving?

1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:49.720
 It tells us about at what level is the acceleration or deceleration pedal set for every one of

1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:50.880
 these proteins.

1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:54.320
 So the genome has 30 some genes.

1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:56.760
 Some genes evolve super, super fast.

1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:59.080
 Others evolve super, super slow.

1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:02.520
 If you look at the polymerase gene that basically replicates the genome, that's a super slow

1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:04.280
 evolving one.

1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:09.480
 If you look at the nucleocapsid protein, that's also super slow evolving.

1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:13.720
 If you look at the spike one protein, this is the part of the spike protein that actually

1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:21.440
 touches the ACE2 receptor and then enables the virus to attach to your cells.

1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:23.920
 That's the thing that gives it that visual.

1:01:23.920 --> 1:01:26.120
 The corona look basically.

1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:29.800
 So basically the spike protein sticks out of the virus and there's a first part of the

1:01:29.800 --> 1:01:37.640
 protein, S1, which basically attaches to the ACE2 receptor and then S2 is the latch that

1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:42.840
 sort of pushes and channels the fusion of the membranes and then the incorporation of

1:01:42.840 --> 1:01:50.640
 the viral RNA inside our cells, which then gets translated into all of these 30 proteins.

1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:56.600
 So the S1 protein is evolving ridiculously fast.

1:01:56.600 --> 1:02:03.800
 So if you look at the stop versus gas pedal, the gas pedal is all the way down.

1:02:03.800 --> 1:02:07.640
 Orph 8 is also evolving super fast and Orph 6 is evolving super fast.

1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:09.040
 We have no idea what they do.

1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:12.400
 We have some idea, but nowhere near what S1 is.

1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:13.400
 So what the...

1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:14.400
 Isn't that terrifying?

1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:20.240
 That means that's a really useful function and if it's evolving fast, doesn't that mean

1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:22.440
 new strains can be created where it does something?

1:02:22.440 --> 1:02:26.960
 That means that it's searching for how to match, how to best match the host.

1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:31.400
 So basically anything in general in evolution, if you look at genomes, anything that's contacting

1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:35.280
 the environment is evolving much faster than anything that's internal.

1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:37.420
 And the reason is that the environment changes.

1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:44.480
 So if you look at the evolution of the cervical viruses, the S1 protein has evolved very rapidly

1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:47.680
 because it's attaching to different hosts each time.

1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:51.800
 We think of them as bats, but there's thousands of species of bats and to go from one species

1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:56.240
 of bat to another species of bat, you have to adjust S1 to the new ACE2 receptor that

1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:58.360
 you're going to be facing in that new species.

1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:00.000
 So quick tangent.

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.320
 Is it fascinating to you that viruses are doing this?

1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:06.960
 I mean, it feels like they're this intelligent organism.

1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:15.760
 I mean, does that give you pause how incredible it is that the evolutionary dynamics that

1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:21.200
 you're describing is actually happening and they're figuring out how to jump from bats

1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:24.640
 to humans all in this distributed fashion.

1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:27.920
 And then most of us don't even say they're alive or intelligent or whatever.

1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:31.360
 So intelligence is in the eye of the beholder.

1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:35.280
 You know, stupid is a stupid does, as Forrest Gump would say.

1:03:35.280 --> 1:03:36.920
 And intelligent is as intelligent does.

1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:41.360
 So basically if the virus is finding solutions that we think of as intelligent, yeah, it's

1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:44.200
 probably intelligent, but that's again in the eye of the beholder.

1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:46.080
 Do you think viruses are intelligent?

1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:47.080
 Of course not.

1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:48.080
 Really?

1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:49.080
 No.

1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:50.400
 It's so incredible.

1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:53.840
 So remember, remember when I was talking about the two components of evolution.

1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:59.400
 One is the stupid mutation, which is completely blind, and the other one is the super smart

1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:02.040
 selection, which is ruthless.

1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:04.960
 So it's not viruses who are smart.

1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:06.960
 It's this component of evolution that's smart.

1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:10.560
 So it's evolution that sort of appears smart.

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:12.200
 And how is that happening?

1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:20.800
 By huge parallel search across thousands of, you know, parallel infections throughout the

1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:21.800
 world right now.

1:04:21.800 --> 1:04:22.800
 Yes.

1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:24.080
 Let's go back on that.

1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:25.080
 So yes.

1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:28.240
 So then the intelligence is in the mechanism.

1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:33.640
 But then by that argument, viruses would be more intelligent because there's just more

1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:34.800
 of them.

1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:40.200
 So the search, they're basically the brute force search that's happening with viruses

1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:46.920
 because there's so many more of them than humans, then they're taken as a whole or more

1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:47.920
 intelligent.

1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:55.200
 So you don't think it's possible that, I mean, who runs, would we even be here if viruses

1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:58.560
 weren't, I mean, who runs this thing?

1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:03.200
 So let me answer your question.

1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:10.600
 So we would not be here if it wasn't for viruses.

1:05:10.600 --> 1:05:15.040
 And part of the reason is that if you look at mammalian evolution early on in this mammalian

1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:19.560
 radiation that basically happened after the death of the dinosaurs is that some of the

1:05:19.560 --> 1:05:27.720
 viruses that we had in our genome spread throughout our genome and created binding sites for new

1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:30.520
 classes of regulatory proteins.

1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:35.560
 And these binding sites that landed all over our genome are now control elements that basically

1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:42.360
 control our genes and sort of help the complexity of the circuitry of mammalian genomes.

1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:49.240
 So everything's co evolution and we're working together and yet you say they're dumb.

1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:51.640
 No, I never said they're dumb.

1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:53.720
 They just don't care.

1:05:53.720 --> 1:05:55.240
 They don't care.

1:05:55.240 --> 1:05:56.920
 Another thing, oh, is the virus trying to kill us?

1:05:56.920 --> 1:05:58.080
 No, it's not.

1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:00.080
 The virus is not trying to kill you.

1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:02.920
 It's actually actively trying to not kill you.

1:06:02.920 --> 1:06:07.480
 So when you get infected, if you die, Palmer, I killed him.

1:06:07.480 --> 1:06:09.280
 Is what the reaction of the virus will be.

1:06:09.280 --> 1:06:10.280
 Why?

1:06:10.280 --> 1:06:12.280
 Because that virus won't spread.

1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:16.480
 I think people have a misconception of viruses are smart or viruses are mean.

1:06:16.480 --> 1:06:19.360
 They don't care.

1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:23.200
 You have to clean yourself of any kind of anthropomorphism out there.

1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:24.200
 I don't know.

1:06:24.200 --> 1:06:25.200
 Oh, yes.

1:06:25.200 --> 1:06:30.200
 So there's a sense when taken as a whole that there's a...

1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:33.320
 Tim, you have to be holder.

1:06:33.320 --> 1:06:34.560
 Stupid is a stupid does.

1:06:34.560 --> 1:06:35.560
 Intelligent is a stupid.

1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:36.560
 Intelligent does.

1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:40.520
 So if you want to call them intelligent, that's fine because the end result is that they're

1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:42.440
 finding amazing solutions.

1:06:42.440 --> 1:06:43.440
 Right.

1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:44.440
 I mean, I mean...

1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:45.720
 But they're so dumb about it.

1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:46.720
 They're just doing dumb.

1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:47.720
 They don't care.

1:06:47.720 --> 1:06:48.720
 They're not dumb and they're not...

1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:49.720
 They just don't care.

1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:50.720
 They don't care.

1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:51.720
 Exactly.

1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:52.720
 The care word is really interesting.

1:06:52.720 --> 1:06:53.720
 Exactly.

1:06:53.720 --> 1:06:54.720
 I mean, there could be an argument that they're conscious.

1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:55.720
 They're just dividing.

1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:56.720
 They're not.

1:06:56.720 --> 1:06:57.720
 They're just dividing.

1:06:57.720 --> 1:07:02.760
 They're just a little entity which happens to be dividing and spreading.

1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:04.560
 It doesn't want to kill us.

1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:06.480
 In fact, it prefers not to kill us.

1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:07.920
 It just wants to spread.

1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:14.440
 And when I say wants, again, I'm anthropomorphizing, but it's just that if you have two versions

1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:18.800
 of a virus, one acquires a mutation that spreads more, that's going to spread more.

1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:21.920
 One acquires a mutation that spreads less, that's going to be lost.

1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:25.240
 One acquires a mutation that enters faster, that's going to be kept.

1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:28.560
 One acquires a mutation that kills you right away, it's going to be lost.

1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:33.920
 So over evolutionary time, the viruses that spread super well but don't kill the host

1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:35.560
 are the ones that are going to survive.

1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:36.560
 Yeah.

1:07:36.560 --> 1:07:41.280
 And so you're brilliantly described the basic mechanisms of how it all happens, but when

1:07:41.280 --> 1:07:50.120
 you zoom out and you see the entirety of viruses, maybe across different strains of viruses,

1:07:50.120 --> 1:07:52.360
 it seems like a living organism.

1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:55.000
 I am in awe of biology.

1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.240
 I find biology amazingly beautiful.

1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:04.360
 I find the design of the current coronavirus, however lethal it is, amazingly beautiful.

1:08:04.360 --> 1:08:10.440
 The way that it is encoded, the way that it tricks your cells into making 30 proteins

1:08:10.440 --> 1:08:12.640
 from a single RNA.

1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:14.640
 Human cells don't do that.

1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:18.280
 Human cells make one protein from each RNA molecule.

1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:20.360
 They don't make two, they make one.

1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:23.960
 We are hardwired to make only one protein from every RNA molecule.

1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:28.840
 And yet this virus goes in, throws in a single messenger RNA.

1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:32.640
 Just like any messenger RNA, we have tens of thousands of messenger RNAs in our cells

1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:34.240
 in any one time.

1:08:34.240 --> 1:08:35.960
 In every one of our cells.

1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:43.160
 It throws in one RNA and that RNA is so, I'm going to use your word here, not my word,

1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:49.440
 intelligent, that it hijacks the entire machinery of your human cell.

1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:54.640
 It basically has at the beginning a giant open reading frame.

1:08:54.640 --> 1:08:57.240
 That's a giant protein that gets translated.

1:08:57.240 --> 1:09:01.840
 Two thirds of that RNA make a single giant protein.

1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:04.640
 That single protein is basically what a human cell would make.

1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:06.320
 It's like, oh, here's a start code.

1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:07.920
 I'm going to start translating here.

1:09:07.920 --> 1:09:08.920
 Human cells are kind of dumb.

1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:09.920
 I'm sorry.

1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:13.840
 Again, this is not the word that we'd normally use, but the human cell basically says, oh,

1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:14.840
 this is an RNA.

1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:15.840
 It must be mine.

1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:16.840
 Let me translate.

1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:17.840
 And it starts translating it.

1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:18.840
 And then you're in trouble.

1:09:18.840 --> 1:09:19.840
 Why?

1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:27.200
 Because that one protein, as it's growing, gets cleaved into about 20 different peptides.

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:32.240
 The first peptide and the second peptide start interacting and the third one and the fourth

1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:33.240
 one.

1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:42.980
 And they shut off the ribosome of the whole cell to not translate human RNAs anymore.

1:09:42.980 --> 1:09:49.240
 So the virus basically hijacks your cells and it cuts, it cleaves every one of your

1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:53.640
 human RNAs to basically say to the ribosome, don't translate this one junk.

1:09:53.640 --> 1:09:55.440
 Don't look at this one junk.

1:09:55.440 --> 1:10:01.500
 And it only spares its own RNAs because they have a particular mark that it spares.

1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:06.800
 Then all of the ribosomes that normally make protein in your human cells are now only able

1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:08.800
 to translate viral RNAs.

1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:11.680
 They're more and more and more and more of them.

1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:13.200
 That's the first 20 proteins.

1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:19.800
 In fact, halfway down about protein 11, between 11 and 12, you basically have a translational

1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:23.560
 slippage where the ribosome skips reading frame.

1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:25.800
 And it translates from one reading frame to another reading frame.

1:10:25.800 --> 1:10:29.560
 That means that about half of them are going to be translated from one to 11.

1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:32.800
 And the other half are going to be translated from 12 to 16.

1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:34.480
 It's gorgeous.

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:37.520
 And then you're done.

1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:42.040
 Then that mRNA will never translate the last 10 proteins, but spike is the one right after

1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:43.040
 that one.

1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:45.240
 So how does spike even get translated?

1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:51.560
 This positive strand RNA virus has a reverse transcriptase, which is an RNA based reverse

1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:52.560
 transcriptase.

1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:57.240
 So from the RNA on the positive strand, it makes an RNA on the negative strand.

1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:01.600
 And in between every single one of these genes, these open reading frames, there's a little

1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:08.960
 signal, AACGCA or something like that, that basically loops over to the beginning of the

1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:10.120
 RNA.

1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:15.160
 And basically instead of sort of having a single full negative strand RNA, it basically has

1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:19.800
 a partial negative strand RNA that ends right before the beginning of that gene.

1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:22.120
 And another one that ends right before the beginning of that gene.

1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:26.880
 These negative strand RNAs now make positive strand RNAs that then look to the human host

1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:29.560
 cell, just like any other human mRNA.

1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:30.560
 It's like, oh, great.

1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:33.720
 I'm going to translate that one because it doesn't have the cleaving that the virus has

1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:36.520
 now put on all your human genes.

1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:38.600
 And then you've lost the battle.

1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:45.600
 That cell is now only making proteins for the virus that will then create the spike protein,

1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:49.280
 the envelope protein, the membrane protein, the nucleocapsid protein that will package

1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:54.000
 up the RNA and then sort of create new viral envelopes.

1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:59.640
 And these will then be secreted out of that cell in new little packages that will then

1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:01.040
 infect the rest of the cells.

1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:02.040
 Repeat the whole process again.

1:12:02.040 --> 1:12:03.040
 It's beautiful, right?

1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:04.040
 It's mind blowing.

1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:06.040
 It's hard not to anthropomorphize it.

1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:08.200
 I know, but it's so gorgeous.

1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:10.000
 So there is a beauty to it.

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:11.000
 Of course.

1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.120
 Is it terrifying to you?

1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:17.320
 So this is something that has happened throughout history.

1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:22.400
 Humans have been nearly wiped out over and over and over again and yet never fully wiped

1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:23.400
 out.

1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:25.920
 So I'm not concerned about the human race.

1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:34.040
 I'm not even concerned about, you know, the impact on sort of our survival as a species.

1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:38.880
 This is absolutely something, I mean, you know, human life is so invaluable and every

1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:40.120
 one of us is so invaluable.

1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:44.720
 But if you think of it as sort of, is this the end of our species?

1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:46.560
 By no means, basically.

1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:48.200
 So let me explain.

1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:52.520
 The Black Death killed what, 30% of Europe?

1:12:52.520 --> 1:13:02.200
 That has left a tremendous imprint, you know, a huge hole, a horrendous hole in the genetic

1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:04.840
 makeup of humans.

1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:11.520
 There's been series of wiping out of huge fractions of entire species or just entire

1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:19.680
 species altogether, and that has a consequence on the human immune repertoire.

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:27.320
 If you look at how Europe was shaped and how Africa was shaped by malaria, for example,

1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:32.240
 all the individuals that carry a mutation that protects you from malaria were able to

1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:33.760
 survive much more.

1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:38.280
 And if you look at the frequency of sickle cell disease and the frequency of malaria,

1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:43.120
 the maps are actually showing the same pattern, the same imprint on Africa.

1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:46.280
 And that basically led people to hypothesize that the reason why sickle cell disease is

1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:51.280
 so much more frequent in Americans of African descent is because there was selection in

1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:58.120
 Africa against malaria, leading to sickle cell, because when the cell sickle, malaria

1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:02.440
 is not able to replicate inside your cells as well, and therefore you protect against

1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:03.440
 that.

1:14:03.440 --> 1:14:07.920
 So if you look at human disease, all of the genetic associations that we do with human

1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:17.040
 disease, you basically see the imprint of these waves of selection killing off gazillions

1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:18.720
 of humans.

1:14:18.720 --> 1:14:24.760
 And there's so many immune processes that are coming up as associated with so many different

1:14:24.760 --> 1:14:26.000
 diseases.

1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.920
 The reason for that is similar to what I was describing earlier, where the outward facing

1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:36.000
 proteins evolve much more rapidly because the environment is always changing.

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:39.840
 But what's really interesting, the human genome is that we have coopted many of these immune

1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:42.520
 genes to carry out nonimmune functions.

1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:49.080
 For example, in our brain, we use immune cells to cleave off neuronal connections that don't

1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:50.240
 get used.

1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:52.960
 This whole use it or lose it, we know the mechanism.

1:14:52.960 --> 1:15:00.040
 It's microglia that cleave off neuronal synaptic connections that are just not utilized.

1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:03.920
 When you utilize them, you mark them in a particular way that basically when the microglia

1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:07.920
 come, tell it, don't kill this one, it's used now.

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:10.560
 And the microglia will go off and kill it once you don't use.

1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:15.040
 This is an immune function, which is coopted to do nonimmune things.

1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:20.320
 If you look at our adipocytes, M1 versus M2 macrophages inside our fat will basically

1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:22.720
 determine whether you're obese or not.

1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:27.140
 And these are, again, immune cells that are resident and living within these tissues.

1:15:27.140 --> 1:15:30.280
 So many disease associations.

1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:36.800
 That we coopt these kinds of things for incredibly complicated functions.

1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:37.800
 Exactly.

1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:42.160
 Evolution works in so many different ways, which are all beautiful and mysterious at the

1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:43.160
 same time.

1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:44.160
 But not intelligent.

1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:45.160
 Not intelligent.

1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:48.160
 It's in the eye of the beholder.

1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:53.640
 But the point that I'm trying to make is that if you look at the imprint that COVID will

1:15:53.640 --> 1:15:56.320
 have, hopefully it will not be big.

1:15:56.320 --> 1:16:00.720
 Hopefully the U.S. will get attacked together and stop the virus from spreading further.

1:16:00.720 --> 1:16:06.080
 But if it doesn't, it's having an imprint on individuals who have particular genetic

1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:07.080
 repertoires.

1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:12.920
 So if you look at now the genetic associations of blood type and immune function cells,

1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:16.440
 et cetera, there's actually association, genetic variation that basically says how

1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:20.360
 much more likely am I or you to die if we contact the virus.

1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:25.720
 And it's through these rounds of shaping the human genome that humans have basically

1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:27.840
 made it so far.

1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:34.480
 And selection is ruthless and it's brutal and it only comes with a lot of killing.

1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:39.440
 But this is the way that viruses and environments have shaped the human genome.

1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:43.840
 Basically, when you go through periods of famine, you select for particular genes.

1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:49.200
 And what's left is not necessarily better, it's just whatever survived.

1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:53.400
 And it may have been the surviving one back then, not because it was better, maybe the

1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:54.960
 ones that ran slower survived.

1:16:54.960 --> 1:16:57.520
 I mean, you know, again, not necessarily better.

1:16:57.520 --> 1:17:03.480
 But the surviving ones are basically the ones that then are shaped for any kind of subsequent

1:17:03.480 --> 1:17:07.360
 evolutionary condition and environmental condition.

1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:12.400
 But if you look at, for example, obesity, obesity was selected for basically the genes

1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:16.760
 that now predisposes to obesity were at 2% frequency in Africa.

1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:23.040
 They rose to 44% frequency in Europe because you basically went through the ice ages and

1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:27.120
 there was a scarcity of food, so you know, there was a selection to being able to store

1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:30.000
 every single calorie you consume.

1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:33.440
 Eventually, environment changes.

1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:38.680
 So the better allele, which was the fat storing allele, became the worse allele because it's

1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:40.440
 the fat storing allele.

1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:42.580
 It still has the same function.

1:17:42.580 --> 1:17:48.320
 So if you look at my genome, speaking of mom calling, mom gave me a bad copy of that gene,

1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:49.320
 this FTO locus.

1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:50.320
 Basically makes me...

1:17:50.320 --> 1:17:53.120
 The one that has to do with obesity.

1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:54.120
 Yeah.

1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:58.120
 Basically now have a bad copy from mom that makes me more likely to be obese.

1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:01.600
 And I also have a bad copy from dad that makes me more likely to be obese.

1:18:01.600 --> 1:18:03.600
 I'm homozygous.

1:18:03.600 --> 1:18:06.600
 And that's the allele.

1:18:06.600 --> 1:18:11.600
 It's still the minor allele, but it's at 44% frequency in Southeast Asia, 42% frequency

1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:14.360
 in Europe, even though it started at 2%.

1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:17.720
 It was an awesome allele to have 100 years ago.

1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:19.520
 Right now, it's a pretty terrible allele.

1:18:19.520 --> 1:18:23.720
 So the other concept is that diversity matters.

1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:30.720
 If we had 100 million nuclear physicists living the earth right now, we'd be in trouble.

1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:34.880
 You need diversity, you need artists and you need musicians and you need mathematicians

1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:38.280
 and you need politicians, yes, even those.

1:18:38.280 --> 1:18:39.280
 And you need like...

1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:41.600
 Well, let's not get crazy now.

1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:44.440
 Because then if a virus comes along or whatever...

1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:45.440
 Exactly.

1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:46.440
 Exactly.

1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:47.440
 So no, there's two reasons.

1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:52.000
 One, you want diversity in the immune repertoire and we have built in diversity.

1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.600
 So basically, they are the most diverse...

1:18:54.600 --> 1:18:57.680
 Basically if you look at our immune system, there's layers and layers of diversity.

1:18:57.680 --> 1:19:04.360
 Like, the way that you create your cells generates diversity because of the selection for the

1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:09.000
 VDGA recombination that basically eventually leads to a huge number of repertoires.

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:10.960
 But that's only one small component of diversity.

1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:12.320
 The blood type is another one.

1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:18.840
 The major histocopatibility complex, the HLA alleles are another source of diversity.

1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:25.520
 So the immune system of humans is by nature incredibly diverse and that basically leads

1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:26.520
 to resilience.

1:19:26.520 --> 1:19:31.160
 So basically what I'm saying that I don't worry for the human species because we are

1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:37.600
 so diverse immunologically, we are likely to be very resilient against so many different

1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:40.040
 attacks like this current virus.

1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:44.600
 So you're saying natural pandemics may not be something that you're really afraid of

1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:49.560
 because of the diversity in our genetic makeup.

1:19:49.560 --> 1:19:50.880
 What about engineered pandemics?

1:19:50.880 --> 1:19:56.960
 Do you have fears of us messing with the makeup of viruses or...

1:19:56.960 --> 1:20:01.680
 Well, yeah, let's say with the makeup of viruses to create something that we can't control

1:20:01.680 --> 1:20:06.560
 and would be much more destructive than it would come about naturally.

1:20:06.560 --> 1:20:10.760
 Remember how we were talking about how smart evolution is, humans are much dumber.

1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:13.800
 You mean like human scientists, engineers?

1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:14.800
 Humans just like...

1:20:14.800 --> 1:20:15.800
 Humans overall.

1:20:15.800 --> 1:20:17.300
 Yeah, humans overall.

1:20:17.300 --> 1:20:28.320
 But I mean, even the sort of synthetic biologists, basically if you were to create virus like

1:20:28.320 --> 1:20:34.160
 SARS that will kill a lot of people, you would probably start with SARS.

1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:41.320
 So whoever would like to design such a thing would basically start with SARS tree or at

1:20:41.320 --> 1:20:43.720
 least some relative of SARS.

1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:48.360
 The source genome for the current virus was something completely different.

1:20:48.360 --> 1:20:50.740
 It was something that has never infected humans.

1:20:50.740 --> 1:20:52.920
 No one in their right mind would have started there.

1:20:52.920 --> 1:20:55.000
 But when you say source, it's like the nearest...

1:20:55.000 --> 1:21:00.840
 The nearest relative is in a whole other branch, no species of which has ever infected humans

1:21:00.840 --> 1:21:02.640
 in that branch.

1:21:02.640 --> 1:21:05.400
 So let's put this to rest.

1:21:05.400 --> 1:21:09.320
 This was not designed by someone to kill off the human race.

1:21:09.320 --> 1:21:11.320
 You don't believe it was engineered?

1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:12.640
 Well, likely.

1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:21.160
 Yeah, the path to engineering a deadly virus would not come from this strain that was used.

1:21:21.160 --> 1:21:28.500
 Moreover, there's been various claims of, ha, ha, this was mixed and matched in the

1:21:28.500 --> 1:21:33.360
 lab because the S1 protein has three different components, each of which has a different

1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:34.720
 evolutionary tree.

1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:39.520
 So a lot of popular press basically said, ha, this came from pangolin and this came

1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:43.000
 from all kinds of other species.

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:46.920
 This is what has been happening throughout the coronavirus tree.

1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:50.640
 So basically the S1 protein has been recombining across species all the time.

1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:54.560
 Remember when I was talking about the positive strand, the negative strand, subgenomic RNAs,

1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:55.560
 these can actually recombine.

1:21:55.560 --> 1:21:59.560
 And if you have two different viruses infecting the same cell, they can actually mix and match

1:21:59.560 --> 1:22:03.040
 between the positive strand and the negative strand and basically create a new hybrid

1:22:03.040 --> 1:22:07.960
 virus with recombination that now has the S1 from one and the rest of the genome from

1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:08.960
 another.

1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:12.080
 And this is something that happens a lot in S1, in Orphe, et cetera.

1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:13.960
 And that's something that's true of the whole tree.

1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:15.480
 For the whole family of coronavirus.

1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:16.480
 Exactly.

1:22:16.480 --> 1:22:20.600
 So it's not like someone has been messing with this for millions of years and, you know,

1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:21.600
 changing the situation.

1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:25.960
 So that's, again, beautiful that that somehow happens, that they recombine.

1:22:25.960 --> 1:22:30.560
 So two different strands can infect the body and then recombine.

1:22:30.560 --> 1:22:35.200
 So all of this actually magic happens inside hosts.

1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:36.200
 Like all, like...

1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:37.200
 Yeah.

1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:40.960
 That's why, that's why classification wise, virus is not thought to be alive because it

1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:41.960
 doesn't self replicate.

1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:43.120
 It's not autonomous.

1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:48.920
 It's something that enters a living cell and then coops it to basically make it its own.

1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:51.600
 But by itself, people ask me, how do we kill this bastard?

1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:54.320
 I'm like, you stop it from replicating.

1:22:54.320 --> 1:23:01.320
 It's not like a bacterium that will just live in a, you know, puddle or something.

1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:02.840
 It's a virus.

1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:04.760
 Viruses don't live without their hosts.

1:23:04.760 --> 1:23:07.440
 And they only live within their hosts for very little time.

1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:10.440
 So if you stop it from replicating, it'll stop from spreading.

1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:14.080
 I mean, it's not like HIV, which can stay dormant for a long time.

1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:15.640
 Basically coronavirus is just don't do that.

1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:16.840
 They're not integrating genomes.

1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:17.840
 They're RNA genomes.

1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:20.280
 So if it's not expressed, it degrades.

1:23:20.280 --> 1:23:21.280
 RNA degrades.

1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:22.680
 It doesn't just stick around.

1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:27.280
 Well, let me ask also about the immune system you mentioned.

1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:34.680
 A lot of people kind of ask, you know, how can we strengthen the immune system to respond

1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:37.480
 to this particular virus, when the virus is in general?

1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:43.800
 Do you have from a biological perspective thoughts on what we can do as humans to strengthen

1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:44.800
 our immune system?

1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:46.880
 If you look at the death rates across different countries.

1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:49.800
 People with less vaccination have been dying more.

1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:55.320
 If you look at North Italy, the vaccination rates are abysmal there, and a lot of people

1:23:55.320 --> 1:23:56.320
 have been dying.

1:23:56.320 --> 1:23:59.080
 If you look at Greece, very good vaccination rates.

1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:00.440
 Almost no one has been dying.

1:24:00.440 --> 1:24:03.680
 So yes, there's a policy component.

1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:06.200
 So Italy reacted very slowly.

1:24:06.200 --> 1:24:07.600
 Greece reacted very fast.

1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:09.880
 So yeah, many fewer people died in Greece.

1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:14.520
 But there might actually be a component of a genetic immune repertoire, basically how

1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:20.160
 did people die off, you know, in the history of the Greek population versus the Italian

1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:21.160
 population?

1:24:21.160 --> 1:24:22.160
 Wow.

1:24:22.160 --> 1:24:24.880
 That's interesting to think about.

1:24:24.880 --> 1:24:29.800
 And then there's a component of what vaccinations did you have as a kid and what are the off

1:24:29.800 --> 1:24:32.560
 target effects of those vaccinations?

1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:35.120
 So basically a vaccination can have two components.

1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:39.520
 One is training your immune system against that specific insult.

1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:44.680
 The second one is boosting up your immune system for all kinds of other things.

1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:51.480
 If you look at allergies, Northern Europe, super clean environments, tons of allergies.

1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:55.040
 Southern Europe, my kids grew up eating dirt.

1:24:55.040 --> 1:24:56.040
 No allergies.

1:24:56.040 --> 1:25:02.200
 So growing up, I never had even heard of what allergies are, like really allergies.

1:25:02.200 --> 1:25:03.520
 And the reason is that I was playing in the garden.

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:07.520
 I was putting all kinds of stuff in my mouth from, you know, all kinds of dirt and stuff.

1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:09.680
 Tons of viruses, there are tons of bacteria there.

1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:11.600
 You know, my immune system was built up.

1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:18.280
 So the more you protect your immune system from exposure, the less opportunity it has

1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:24.120
 to learn about non self repertoire in a way that prepares it for the next insult.

1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:28.240
 So that's the horizontal thing too, like the, so it's throughout your lifetime and the

1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:34.080
 lifetime of the, of the people that your ancestors, that kind of thing.

1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:35.080
 Yeah.

1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:36.080
 Absolutely.

1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:39.660
 So it returns against free will on the free will side of things.

1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:44.880
 Is there something we could do to strengthen our immune system in 2020?

1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:50.840
 Is there like, you know, exercise, diet, all that kind of stuff.

1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:53.080
 So it's kind of funny.

1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:58.480
 There's a cartoon that basically shows two windows with a teller in each window.

1:25:58.480 --> 1:26:02.400
 One has a humongous line and the other one has no one.

1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:07.320
 The one that has no one above says health, no, it says exercise and diet.

1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:12.240
 And the other one says pill and there's a huge line for pill.

1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:17.040
 So we're looking basically for magic bullets for sort of ways that we can, you know, beat

1:26:17.040 --> 1:26:20.600
 cancer and beat coronavirus and beat this and beat that and it turns out that the window

1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:26.200
 with like just diet and exercise is the best way to boost every aspect of your health.

1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:32.360
 If you look at Alzheimer's, exercise and nutrition, I mean, you're like, really?

1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:34.640
 For my brain neurodegeneration?

1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:35.640
 Absolutely.

1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:44.060
 If you look at cancer, exercise and nutrition, if you look at coronavirus, exercise and nutrition,

1:26:44.060 --> 1:26:47.400
 every single aspect of human health gets improved.

1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:51.200
 And one of the studies we're doing now is basically looking at what are the effects

1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:53.120
 of diet and exercise?

1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:55.400
 How similar are they to each other?

1:26:55.400 --> 1:27:01.440
 We basically take in diet intervention and exercise intervention in human and in mice

1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:05.320
 and we're basically doing single cell profiling of a bunch of different tissues to basically

1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:11.440
 understand how are the cells, both the stromal cells and the immune cells of each of these

1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:15.280
 tissues responding to the effect of exercise?

1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:22.240
 What are the communication networks between different cells where the muscle that exercises

1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:26.440
 sends signals through the bloodstream, through the lymphatic system, through all kinds of

1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:32.240
 other systems that give signals to other cells that I have exercised and you should change

1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:40.200
 in this particular way, which basically reconfigure those receptor cells with the effect of exercise?

1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:44.160
 How well understood is those reconfigurations?

1:27:44.160 --> 1:27:45.160
 Very little.

1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:47.480
 We're just starting now, basically.

1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:54.240
 Is the hope there to understand the effect on the immune system?

1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:58.240
 On the immune system, the effect on brain, the effect on your liver, on your digestive

1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:03.960
 system, on your adipocytes, adipose, you know, the most misunderstood organ.

1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:07.600
 Everybody thinks, oh, fat, terrible, no, fat is awesome.

1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:11.680
 Your fat cells is what's keeping you alive because if you didn't have your fat cells,

1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:15.560
 all those lipids and all those calories would be floating around in your blood and you'd

1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:17.040
 be dead by now.

1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:18.520
 Your adipocytes are your best friend.

1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:23.560
 They're basically storing all these excess calories so that they don't hurt all of the

1:28:23.560 --> 1:28:29.080
 rest of the body and they're also fat burning in many ways.

1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:33.880
 So, you know, again, when you don't have the homozygous version that I have, your cells

1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:40.000
 are able to burn calories much more easily by sort of flipping a master metabolic switch

1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:45.120
 that involves these FTO locus that I mentioned earlier and its target genes, IRX3 and RX5,

1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:50.680
 that basically switch your adipocytes during their three first days of differentiation

1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:55.880
 as they're becoming mature adipocytes to basically become either fat burning or fat storing

1:28:55.880 --> 1:28:57.240
 fat cells.

1:28:57.240 --> 1:28:59.080
 And the fat burning fat cells are your best friends.

1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:03.120
 They're much closer to muscle than they are to white adipocytes.

1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:08.560
 Is there a lot of difference between people like that you could give, science could eventually

1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:16.240
 give advice that is very generalizable or is our differences in our genetic makeup, like

1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:23.040
 you mentioned, is that going to be basically something we have to be very specialized individuals?

1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:26.120
 Any advice we'd give in terms of diet, like what we're just talking about?

1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:30.040
 Believe it or not, the most personalized advice that you give for nutrition don't have to

1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:31.040
 do with your genome.

1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:36.000
 They have to do with your gut microbiome, with the bacteria that live inside you.

1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:40.480
 So most of your digestion is actually happening by species that are not human inside you.

1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:43.160
 You have more nonhuman cells than you have human cells.

1:29:43.160 --> 1:29:50.600
 They're basically a giant bag of bacteria with a few human cells alone.

1:29:50.600 --> 1:29:55.040
 And those do not necessarily have to do with your genetic makeup?

1:29:55.040 --> 1:29:56.840
 They interact with your genetic makeup.

1:29:56.840 --> 1:29:58.040
 They interact with your epigenome.

1:29:58.040 --> 1:29:59.640
 They interact with your nutrition.

1:29:59.640 --> 1:30:01.640
 They interact with your environment.

1:30:01.640 --> 1:30:07.080
 They're basically an additional source of variation.

1:30:07.080 --> 1:30:11.400
 So when you're thinking about personalized nutritional advice, part of that is actually

1:30:11.400 --> 1:30:13.760
 how do you match your microbiome?

1:30:13.760 --> 1:30:17.240
 And part of that is how do we match your genetics?

1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:22.440
 But again, this is a very diverse set of contributors.

1:30:22.440 --> 1:30:27.160
 And the effect sizes are not enormous, so I think the science for that is not fully developed

1:30:27.160 --> 1:30:28.160
 yet.

1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:31.480
 Speaking of diets, because I've wrestled in combat sports, but sports my whole life

1:30:31.480 --> 1:30:35.520
 were weight matters, so you have to cut and all that stuff.

1:30:35.520 --> 1:30:40.560
 One thing I've learned a lot about my body, and it seems to be, I think, true about other

1:30:40.560 --> 1:30:45.280
 people's bodies is that you can adjust to a lot of things.

1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:52.320
 That's the miraculous thing about this biological system is I fast often.

1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:57.120
 I used to eat five, six times a day, and thought that was absolutely necessary.

1:30:57.120 --> 1:30:59.280
 How could you not eat that often?

1:30:59.280 --> 1:31:03.600
 And then when I started fasting, your body adjusted that, and you learned how to not

1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:04.600
 eat.

1:31:04.600 --> 1:31:10.360
 And if you just give it a chance for a few weeks, actually, over a period of a few weeks,

1:31:10.360 --> 1:31:11.880
 your body can adjust to anything.

1:31:11.880 --> 1:31:12.880
 And that's a miracle.

1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:14.240
 That's such a beautiful thing.

1:31:14.240 --> 1:31:18.680
 So I'm a computer scientist, and I've basically gone through periods of 24 hours without eating

1:31:18.680 --> 1:31:23.080
 or stopping, and then I'm like, oh, must eat, and I eat a ton.

1:31:23.080 --> 1:31:27.560
 I used to order two pizzas just with my brother.

1:31:27.560 --> 1:31:31.040
 So I've gone through these extremes as well, and I've gone through the whole intermittent

1:31:31.040 --> 1:31:35.920
 fasting thing, so I can sympathize with you both on the seven meals a day to the zero

1:31:35.920 --> 1:31:37.680
 meals a day.

1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:44.280
 So I think when I say everything with moderation, I actually think your body responds interestingly

1:31:44.280 --> 1:31:47.320
 to these different changes in diet.

1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:52.040
 I think part of the reason why we lose weight with pretty much every kind of change in behavior

1:31:52.040 --> 1:31:58.600
 is because our epigenome and the set of proteins and enzymes that are expressed and our microbiome

1:31:58.600 --> 1:32:04.080
 are not well suited to that nutritional source, and therefore, they will not be able to sort

1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:09.280
 of catch everything that you give them, and then a lot of that will go undigested.

1:32:09.280 --> 1:32:13.680
 And that basically means that your body can then lose weight in the short term, but very

1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:18.120
 quickly will adjust to that new normal, and then we'll be able to sort of perhaps gain

1:32:18.120 --> 1:32:20.480
 a lot of weight from the diet.

1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:26.400
 So anyway, I mean, there's also studies in factories where basically people dim the

1:32:26.400 --> 1:32:28.720
 lights, and then suddenly everybody started working better.

1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:30.320
 It was like, wow, that's amazing.

1:32:30.320 --> 1:32:32.640
 Three weeks later, they made the lights a little brighter.

1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:35.440
 Everybody started working better.

1:32:35.440 --> 1:32:40.720
 So any kind of intervention has a placebo effect of, wow, now I'm healthier, and I'm

1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:42.120
 going to be running more often, et cetera.

1:32:42.120 --> 1:32:46.040
 So it's very hard to uncouple the placebo effect of, wow, I'm doing something to intervene

1:32:46.040 --> 1:32:50.360
 on my diet from the, wow, this is actually the right thing for me.

1:32:50.360 --> 1:32:51.360
 So you know.

1:32:51.360 --> 1:32:55.560
 Yeah, from the perspective from nutrition science, psychology, both things I'm interested

1:32:55.560 --> 1:33:02.600
 in, especially psychology, it seems that it's extremely difficult to do good science because

1:33:02.600 --> 1:33:07.080
 there's so many variables involved, it's so difficult to control the variables, so difficult

1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:12.800
 to do sufficiently large scale experiments, both sort of in terms of number of subjects

1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:19.800
 and temporal, like how long you do the study for, that it just seems like it's not even

1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:22.640
 a real science for now, like nutrition science.

1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:28.440
 I want to jump into the whole placebo effect for a little bit here, and basically talk

1:33:28.440 --> 1:33:30.320
 about the implications of that.

1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:35.360
 If I give you a sugar pill and I tell you it's a sugar pill, you won't get any better.

1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:40.400
 But if I tell you a sugar pill and I tell you, wow, this is an amazing drug, it actually

1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:46.440
 will stop your cancer, your cancer will actually stop with much higher probability.

1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:47.440
 What does that mean?

1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:48.440
 That's so amazing.

1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:52.360
 That means that if I can trick your brain into thinking that I'm healing you, your brain

1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:56.240
 will basically figure out a way to heal itself, to heal the body.

1:33:56.240 --> 1:34:01.920
 And that tells us that there's so much that we don't understand in the interplay between

1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:10.080
 our cognition and our biology that if we were able to better harvest the power of our brain

1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:16.080
 to sort of impact the body through the placebo effect, we would be so much better in so many

1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:17.520
 different things.

1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:20.760
 Just by tricking yourself into thinking that you're doing better, you're actually doing

1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:21.760
 better.

1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:25.360
 So there's something to be said about sort of positive thinking, about optimism, about

1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:34.920
 sort of just getting your brain and your mind into the right mindset that helps your body

1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:37.360
 and helps your entire biology.

1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:39.920
 From a science perspective, that's just fascinating.

1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:45.200
 Obviously, most things about the brain is a total mystery for now, but that's a fascinating

1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:51.480
 interplay that the brain can reduce.

1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:56.000
 The brain can help cure cancer, I don't even know what to do with that.

1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.520
 I mean, the way to think about that is the following.

1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:03.320
 The converse of the equation is something that we are much more comfortable with.

1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:10.200
 Like, oh, if you're stressed, then your heart might rise and all kinds of sort of toxins

1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:15.240
 might be released and that can have a detrimental effect on your body, et cetera, et cetera.

1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:21.800
 So maybe it's easier to understand your body healing from your mind by your mind is not

1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:24.920
 killing your body, or at least it's killing it less.

1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:31.840
 So I think that aspect of the stress equation is a little easier for most of us to conceptualize,

1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:36.200
 but then the healing part is perhaps the same pathways, perhaps different pathways, but

1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:39.440
 again, something that is totally untapped scientifically.

1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:44.520
 I think we try to bring this question up a couple of times, but let's return to it again

1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:49.480
 as what do you think is the difference between the way a computer represents information,

1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:56.600
 the human genome represents and stores information, and maybe broadly, what is the difference between

1:35:56.600 --> 1:35:59.920
 how you think about computers and how you think about biological systems?

1:35:59.920 --> 1:36:04.760
 So I made a very provocative claim earlier that we are a digital computer, like that

1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:08.880
 at the core lies a digital code, and that's true in many ways, but surrounding that digital

1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:11.000
 core, there's a huge amount of analog.

1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:15.840
 If you look at our brain, it's not really digital, if you look at our sort of RNA and

1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:21.160
 all of that stuff inside ourselves, not really digital, it's really analog in many ways.

1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:24.920
 But let's start with the code, and then we'll expand to the rest.

1:36:24.920 --> 1:36:27.920
 So the code itself is digital.

1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:32.680
 So there's genes, you can think of the genes as, I don't know, the procedures, the functions

1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:34.240
 inside your language.

1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:37.400
 And then somehow you have to turn these functions on, how do you call the gene?

1:36:37.400 --> 1:36:39.440
 How do you call that function?

1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:44.080
 The way that you would do it in old programming languages is go to, address whatever in your

1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:46.640
 memory, and then you'd start running from there.

1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:51.720
 And modern programming languages have encapsulated this into functions and objects and all of

1:36:51.720 --> 1:36:55.520
 that, and it's nice and cute, but in the end, deep down, there's still an assembly code

1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:59.800
 that says go to that instruction, and it runs that instruction.

1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:07.040
 If you look at the human genome, and the genome of pretty much most species out there, there's

1:37:07.040 --> 1:37:08.240
 no go to function.

1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:18.920
 You just don't start in transcribing in position 1300, 13,527 in chromosome 12.

1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:22.000
 You instead have content based indexing.

1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:28.760
 So at every location in the genome, in front of the genes that need to be turned on, I

1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:34.800
 don't know when you drink coffee, there's a little coffee marker in front of all of them.

1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:40.400
 And whenever your cells that metabolize coffee need to metabolize coffee, they basically see

1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:44.840
 coffee and they're like, ooh, let's go turn on all the coffee marked genes.

1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:50.920
 So there's basically these small motifs, these small sequences that we call regulatory motifs.

1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:52.120
 They're like patterns of DNA.

1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:58.360
 They're only eight characters long or so, like GAT, GCA, et cetera.

1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:06.320
 And these motifs work in combinations, and every one of them has some recruitment affinity

1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:09.800
 for a different protein that will then come and bind it.

1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:15.440
 And together, collections of these motifs create regions that we call regulatory regions

1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:20.080
 that can be either promoters near the beginning of the gene, and that basically tells you

1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:24.760
 where the function actually starts, where you call it, and then enhancers that are looping

1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:30.000
 around of the DNA that basically bring the machinery that binds those enhancers and then

1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:36.680
 bring it onto the promoter, which then recruits the right sort of the ribosome and the polymerase

1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:41.560
 and all of that thing, which will first transcribe and then export and then eventually translate

1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:45.720
 in the cytoplasm, you know, whatever RNA molecule.

1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:56.040
 So the beauty of the way that the digital computer that's the genome works is that it's

1:38:56.040 --> 1:38:58.840
 extremely fault tolerant.

1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:04.560
 If I took your hard drive and I messed with 20% of the letters in it, of those zeros and

1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:08.240
 ones and I flipped them, you'd be in trouble.

1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:14.760
 If I take the genome and I flipped 20% of the letters, you probably won't even notice.

1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:21.520
 And that resilience is a key design principle, and again, I'm thrombomorphizing here, but

1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:25.160
 it's a key driving principle of how biological systems work.

1:39:25.160 --> 1:39:28.680
 They're first resilient and then anything else.

1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:36.120
 And when you look at these incredible beauty of life from the most, I don't know, beautiful,

1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:41.560
 I don't know, human genome maybe of humanity and all of the ideals that come with it to

1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:48.360
 the most terrifying genome like, I don't know, COVID 19, SARS COVID 2 and the current pandemic,

1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:56.640
 you basically see this elegance as the epitome of clean design, but it's dirty.

1:39:56.640 --> 1:39:58.080
 It's a mess.

1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:02.960
 It's, you know, the way to get there is hugely messy.

1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:06.760
 And that's something that we as computer scientists don't embrace.

1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:12.920
 We like to have clean code, you know, as like in engineering, they teach you about compartmentalization,

1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:18.080
 about sort of separating functions, about modularity, about hierarchical design, none

1:40:18.080 --> 1:40:20.080
 of that applies in biology.

1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:21.080
 Testing.

1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:22.080
 Testing, sure.

1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:27.120
 Yeah, biology does plenty of that, but I mean, through evolutionary exploration.

1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:35.000
 But if you look at biological systems, first they are robust and then they specialize to

1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:36.840
 become anything else.

1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:42.200
 And if you look at viruses, the reason why they're so elegant when you look at the design

1:40:42.200 --> 1:40:46.560
 of this, you know, genome, it seems so elegant.

1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:52.080
 And the reason for that is that it's been stripped down from something much larger because

1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:54.080
 of the pressure to keep it compact.

1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:58.760
 So many compact genomes out there have ancestors that were much larger.

1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:00.880
 You don't start small and become big.

1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:06.280
 You go through a loop of add a bunch of stuff, increase complexity, and then, you know, slim

1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:07.600
 it down.

1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:12.240
 And one of my early papers was, in fact, on genome duplication.

1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:16.960
 One of the things we found is that baker's yeast, which is the yeast that you use to

1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:20.440
 make bread, but also the yeast that you use to make wine, which is basically the dominant

1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:24.080
 species when you go in the fields of Tuscany and you say, you know, what's out there?

1:41:24.080 --> 1:41:26.480
 It's basically Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:31.480
 Or the way my Italian friends say, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:34.480
 Which means what?

1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:35.480
 Oh, Saccharomyces.

1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:36.480
 Okay.

1:41:36.480 --> 1:41:37.480
 I'm sorry.

1:41:37.480 --> 1:41:38.480
 I'm Greek.

1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:39.480
 So, yeah.

1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:40.480
 Zaharo.

1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:41.480
 Zaharo is sugar.

1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:42.480
 Micis is fungus.

1:41:42.480 --> 1:41:43.480
 Yes.

1:41:43.480 --> 1:41:44.480
 Cerevisiae.

1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:45.480
 Cerveza.

1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:46.480
 Beer.

1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:47.480
 So it means the sugar fungus of beer.

1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:48.480
 Yeah.

1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:51.160
 You know, let's, let's, let's be sounding to the.

1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:52.160
 Still poetic.

1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:53.160
 Yeah.

1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:58.240
 Anyway, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, basically the major baker's yeast out there is the descendant

1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:00.520
 of a whole gene duplication.

1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:06.800
 Why would a whole gene duplication even happen when it happened is coinciding with about

1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:14.480
 a hundred million years ago and the emergence of fruit bearing plants?

1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:15.760
 Why fruit bearing plants?

1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:23.000
 Because animals would eat the fruit and would walk around and poop huge amounts of nutrients

1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.760
 along with a seed for the plants to spread.

1:42:26.760 --> 1:42:29.000
 Before that, plants were not spreading through animals.

1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:32.440
 They were spreading through wind and all kinds of other ways.

1:42:32.440 --> 1:42:36.800
 But basically the moment you have fruit bearing plants, the, the, the, the, these plants are

1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:40.440
 basically creating this abundance of sugar in the environment.

1:42:40.440 --> 1:42:43.160
 So there's an evolutionary niche that gets created.

1:42:43.160 --> 1:42:48.760
 And in that evolutionary niche, you basically have enough sugar that a whole gene duplication

1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:55.080
 which initially is a very messy event allows you to then, you know, relieve some of that

1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:56.080
 complexity.

1:42:56.080 --> 1:42:59.840
 So to pause, what does genome duplication mean?

1:42:59.840 --> 1:43:05.760
 That basically means that instead of having eight chromosomes, you're gonna have 16 chromosomes.

1:43:05.760 --> 1:43:13.600
 So, but the duplication at first, when you have six, when you go to 16, you're not using

1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:14.600
 that.

1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:15.600
 Oh yeah, you are.

1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:16.600
 Yeah.

1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:20.800
 So when you go to the next, you went from having eight chromosomes to having 16 chromosomes,

1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:24.440
 probably a non disjunction event during a duplication, during a division.

1:43:24.440 --> 1:43:28.200
 So you basically divide the cell instead of half the genome going this way and half the

1:43:28.200 --> 1:43:29.440
 genome going the other way.

1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:33.280
 After duplication of the genome, you basically have all of it going to one cell.

1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:38.560
 And then there's a sufficient messiness there that you end up with slight differences that

1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:42.560
 make most of these chromosomes be actually preserved.

1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:45.240
 It's a long story short to basically, but it's a big upgrade, right?

1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:49.720
 So that's not necessarily because what happens immediately thereafter is that you start massively

1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:52.520
 losing tons of those duplicated genes.

1:43:52.520 --> 1:43:58.400
 So 90% of those genes were actually lost very rapidly after holding duplication.

1:43:58.400 --> 1:44:02.000
 And the reason for that is that biology is not intelligent.

1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:06.680
 It's just ruthless selection, random mutation.

1:44:06.680 --> 1:44:10.160
 So the ruthless selection basically means that as soon as one of the random mutations

1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:13.600
 hit one gene, ruthless selection just kills off that gene.

1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:19.840
 It's just, you know, if you have a pressure to maintain a small compact genome, you will

1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:23.120
 very rapidly lose the second copy of most of your genes.

1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:26.040
 And a small number, 10%, were kept into copies.

1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:31.360
 And those had to do a lot with environment adaptation, with the speed of replication,

1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:34.520
 with the speed of translation, and with sugar processing.

1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:39.040
 So I'm making a long story short to basically say that evolution is messy.

1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:44.440
 The only way, like so, you know, the example that I was giving of messing with 20% of your

1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:49.480
 bits in your computer, totally bogus, duplicating all your functions and just throwing them

1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:53.640
 out there in the same, you know, function, just totally bogus, like this would never

1:44:53.640 --> 1:44:55.480
 work in an engineer system.

1:44:55.480 --> 1:45:01.080
 But biological systems, because of this content based indexing and because of this modularity

1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:05.440
 that comes from the fact that the gene is controlled by a series of tags.

1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:10.680
 And now if you need this gene in another setting, you just add some more tags that will basically

1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:12.880
 turn it on also in those settings.

1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:17.760
 So this gene is now pressured to do two different functions.

1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:19.960
 And it builds up complexity.

1:45:19.960 --> 1:45:24.880
 I see a whole gene duplication and gene duplication in general as a way to relieve that complexity.

1:45:24.880 --> 1:45:30.320
 So you have this gradual buildup of complexity as function gets sort of added onto the existing

1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:31.320
 genes.

1:45:31.320 --> 1:45:37.160
 And then boom, you duplicate your workforce, and you now have two copies of this gene.

1:45:37.160 --> 1:45:40.720
 One will probably specialize to do one, and the other one will specialize to do the other,

1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:44.920
 or one will maintain the ancestral function, the other one will sort of be free to evolve

1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:48.920
 and specialize while losing the ancestral function and so on and so forth.

1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:50.560
 So that's how genomes evolve.

1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:56.720
 They're just messy things, but they're extremely fault tolerant, and they're extremely able

1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:04.120
 to deal with mutations because that's the very way that you generate new functions.

1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:08.000
 So new functionalization comes from the very thing that breaks it.

1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:12.840
 So even in the current pandemic, many people are asking me which mutations matter the most.

1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:17.520
 And what I tell them is, well, we can study the evolutionary dynamics of the current genome

1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:26.400
 to then understand which mutations have previously happened or not, and which mutations happen

1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:29.280
 in genes that evolve rapidly or not.

1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:34.280
 And one of the things we found, for example, is that the genes that evolved rapidly in

1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:37.840
 the past are still evolving rapidly now in the current pandemic.

1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:41.160
 The genes that evolved slowly in the past are still evolving slowly.

1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:43.000
 Which means that they're useful.

1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:48.560
 Which means that they're under the same evolutionary pressures, but then the question is what happens

1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:50.600
 in specific mutations.

1:46:50.600 --> 1:46:55.560
 So if you look at the D614 gene mutation that's been all over the news, so in positions

1:46:55.560 --> 1:47:04.520
 D614 in the amino acids, D614 of the S protein, there's a D2G mutation that sort of has crept

1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:07.880
 over the population.

1:47:07.880 --> 1:47:13.600
 That mutation we found out through my work disrupts a perfectly conserved nucleotide

1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:18.480
 position that has never been changed in the history of millions of years of equivalent

1:47:18.480 --> 1:47:23.240
 mammalian evolution of these viruses.

1:47:23.240 --> 1:47:27.640
 That basically means that it's a completely new adaptation to human.

1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:33.920
 And that mutation has now gone from 1% frequency to 90% frequency in almost all outbreaks.

1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:39.520
 So there's a mutation, I like how you said in the mute, the 416, what was it?

1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:41.160
 Yeah, 614, sorry.

1:47:41.160 --> 1:47:42.160
 614.

1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:43.160
 D614G.

1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:44.160
 D614G.

1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:48.560
 So literally, so what you're saying is this is like a chest move.

1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:50.640
 So it just mutated one letter to another.

1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:51.640
 Exactly.

1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:54.440
 It didn't happen before.

1:47:54.440 --> 1:47:58.760
 And this somehow, this mutation is really useful.

1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:04.000
 It's really useful in the current environment of the genome, which is moving from human

1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:05.080
 to human.

1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:08.800
 When it was moving from bat to bat, it couldn't care less for that mutation.

1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:13.320
 But it's environment specific, so now that it's moving from human to human, it's moving

1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:17.320
 way better by orders of magnitude.

1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:23.680
 So you're tracking this evolutionary dynamics, which is fascinating, but what do you do with

1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:24.680
 that?

1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:25.680
 So what does that mean?

1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:33.520
 What do you make of this mutation in trying to anticipate, I guess, is one of the things

1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:39.160
 you're trying to do is anticipate where, how this unrolls into the future, this evolutionary

1:48:39.160 --> 1:48:40.160
 dynamics.

1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:41.160
 Such a great question.

1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:43.200
 So there's two things.

1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:47.720
 Remember when I was saying earlier, mutation is the path to new things, but also the path

1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:49.880
 to break old things.

1:48:49.880 --> 1:48:56.920
 So what we know is that this position was extremely preserved through gazillions of mutations.

1:48:56.920 --> 1:49:00.320
 That mutation was never tolerated when it was moving from bats to bats.

1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:04.800
 So that basically means that that position is extremely important in the function of

1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:05.800
 that protein.

1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:07.000
 That's the first thing it tells.

1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:13.320
 The second one is that that position was very well suited to bat transmission, but now is

1:49:13.320 --> 1:49:17.400
 not well suited to human transmission, so it got rid of it, and it now has a new version

1:49:17.400 --> 1:49:22.880
 of that amino acid that basically makes it much easier to transmit from human to human.

1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:30.640
 So in terms of the evolutionary history teaching us about the future, it basically tells us

1:49:30.640 --> 1:49:35.080
 here's the regions that are currently mutating.

1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:38.040
 Here's the regions that are most likely to mutate going forward.

1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:42.440
 As you're building a vaccine, here's what you should be focusing on in terms of the

1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:48.200
 most stable regions that are the least likely to mutate, or here's the newly evolved functions

1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:54.480
 that are the most likely to be important because they've overcome this local maximum

1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:59.480
 that it had reached in the bat transmission.

1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:04.480
 So anyway, it's a tangent to basically say that evolution works in messy ways, and the

1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:11.560
 thing that you would break is the thing that actually allows you to first go through a

1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:15.560
 lull and then reach a new local maximum.

1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:21.560
 And I often like to say that if engineers had basically designed evolution, we would

1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:29.720
 still be perfectly replicating bacteria because it's by making the bacterium worse that you

1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:32.440
 allow evolution to reach a new optimum.

1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:42.920
 That's just a pause on that, that's so profound for the entirety of this scientific and engineering

1:50:42.920 --> 1:50:43.920
 disciplines.

1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:44.920
 Exactly.

1:50:44.920 --> 1:50:48.660
 We as engineers need to embrace breaking things.

1:50:48.660 --> 1:50:54.360
 We as engineers need to embrace robustness as the first principle beyond perfection because

1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:56.320
 nothing's going to ever be perfect.

1:50:56.320 --> 1:51:01.080
 And when you're sending a satellite to Mars, when something goes wrong, it'll break down

1:51:01.080 --> 1:51:09.280
 as opposed to building systems that tolerate failure and are resilient to that and in fact

1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:11.240
 get better through that.

1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:15.720
 So the SpaceX approach versus NASA for the...

1:51:15.720 --> 1:51:17.720
 For example.

1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:22.560
 Is there something we can learn about the incredible, take lessons from the incredible

1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:29.120
 biological systems in their resilience, in their in the mushiness, the messiness to our

1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:31.920
 computing systems, to our computers?

1:51:31.920 --> 1:51:35.360
 It would basically be starting from scratch in many ways.

1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:41.480
 It would basically be building new paradigms that don't try to get the right answer all

1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:47.080
 the time, but try to get the right answer most of the time or a lot of the time.

1:51:47.080 --> 1:51:50.760
 Do you see deep learning systems in the whole world of machine learning as kind of taking

1:51:50.760 --> 1:51:52.360
 a step in that direction?

1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:53.360
 Absolutely.

1:51:53.360 --> 1:52:01.360
 Basically, by allowing this much more natural evolution of these parameters, you basically...

1:52:01.360 --> 1:52:06.640
 And if you look at sort of deep learning systems, again, they're not inspired by the genome aspect

1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:07.640
 of biology.

1:52:07.640 --> 1:52:10.280
 They're inspired by the brain aspect of biology.

1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:17.320
 And again, I want you to pause for a second and realize the complexity of the entire human

1:52:17.320 --> 1:52:25.120
 brain with trillions of connections within our neurons, with millions of cells talking

1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:34.400
 to each other, is still encoded within that same genome, that same genome encodes every

1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:38.200
 single freaking cell type of the entire body.

1:52:38.200 --> 1:52:45.240
 Every single cell is encoded by the same code, and yet specialization allows you to have

1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:54.600
 the single viral like genome that self replicates, the single module, modular automaton, work

1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:59.080
 with other copies of itself, it's mind boggling.

1:52:59.080 --> 1:53:02.760
 Create complex organs through which blood flows.

1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:03.760
 And what is that blood?

1:53:03.760 --> 1:53:07.320
 The same freaking genome.

1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:10.960
 Create organs that communicate with each other.

1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:12.200
 And what are these organs?

1:53:12.200 --> 1:53:14.640
 The exact same genome.

1:53:14.640 --> 1:53:22.920
 Create a brain that is innervated by massive amounts of blood pumping energy to it, 20%

1:53:22.920 --> 1:53:28.280
 of our energetic needs, to the brain from the same genome.

1:53:28.280 --> 1:53:33.960
 And all of the neuronal connections, all of the auxiliary cells, all of the immune cells,

1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:37.400
 the astrocytes, the ligature size, the neurons, the excitatory, the inhibitory neurons, all

1:53:37.400 --> 1:53:43.000
 of the different classes of parasites, the blood brain barrier, all of that, same genome.

1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:49.120
 One way to see that in a sad, this one is beautiful, the sad thing is thinking about

1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:55.320
 the trillions of organisms that died to create that.

1:53:55.320 --> 1:53:56.760
 You mean on the evolutionary path?

1:53:56.760 --> 1:53:59.720
 Yeah, on the evolutionary path to humans.

1:53:59.720 --> 1:54:08.640
 It's crazy, there's two dissenters of apes just talking on a podcast, okay, so mind boggling.

1:54:08.640 --> 1:54:11.280
 Just to boggle our minds a little bit more.

1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:14.080
 Just talking to each other.

1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:21.280
 We are basically generating a series of vocal utterances through our pulsating of vocal

1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:23.520
 cords received through this.

1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:30.040
 The people who listen to this are taking a completely different path to that information

1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:33.200
 transfer yet through language.

1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:39.160
 But imagine if we could connect these brains directly to each other.

1:54:39.160 --> 1:54:46.320
 The amount of information that I'm condensing into a small number of words is a huge funnel

1:54:46.320 --> 1:54:52.280
 which then you receive and you expand into a huge number of thoughts from that small

1:54:52.280 --> 1:54:55.840
 funnel.

1:54:55.840 --> 1:55:00.720
 In many ways, engineers would love to have the whole information transfer, just take

1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:05.560
 the whole set of neurons and throw them away, I mean throw them to the other person.

1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:11.840
 This might actually not be better because in your misinterpretation of every word that

1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:16.280
 I'm saying, you are creating new interpretation that might actually be way better than what

1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:18.040
 I meant in the first place.

1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:25.280
 The ambiguity of language perhaps might be the secret to creativity.

1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:31.080
 Every single time you work on a project by yourself, you only bounce ideas with one person

1:55:31.080 --> 1:55:35.960
 and your neurons are basically fully cognizant of what these ideas are.

1:55:35.960 --> 1:55:41.360
 But the moment you interact with another person, the misinterpretations that happen might be

1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:43.880
 the most creative part of the process.

1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:47.760
 With my students, every time we have a research meeting, I very often pause and say, let me

1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:50.680
 repeat what you just said in a different way.

1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:56.080
 And I sort of go on and brainstorm with what they were saying, but by the third time, it's

1:55:56.080 --> 1:55:58.120
 not what they were saying at all.

1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:02.200
 And when they pick up what I'm saying, they're like, oh, well, da, da, da, now they've sort

1:56:02.200 --> 1:56:05.440
 of learned something very different from what I was saying.

1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:11.040
 And that is the same kind of messiness that I'm describing in the genome itself.

1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:13.640
 It's sort of embracing the messiness.

1:56:13.640 --> 1:56:15.480
 And that's a feature, not a book.

1:56:15.480 --> 1:56:16.480
 Exactly.

1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:20.280
 And in the same way, when you're thinking about these deep learning systems that will

1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:26.360
 allow us to sort of be more creative perhaps or learn better approximations of these complex

1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:33.680
 functions, again, tuned to the universe that we inhabit, you have to embrace the breaking.

1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:38.080
 You have to embrace the, you know, how do we get out of these local optima?

1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:43.840
 And a lot of the design paradigms that have made deep learning so successful are ways

1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:50.560
 to get away from that, ways to get better training by sort of sending long range messages,

1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:57.840
 these LSTM models and the, you know, sort of feed forward loops that, you know, sort

1:56:57.840 --> 1:57:01.000
 of jump through layers of a convolutional neural network.

1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:07.480
 All of these things are basically ways to push you out of these local maxima.

1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:08.880
 And that's sort of what evolution does.

1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:09.880
 That's what language does.

1:57:09.880 --> 1:57:12.400
 That's what conversation and brainstorming does.

1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:13.680
 That's what our brain does.

1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:20.480
 So, you know, this design paradigm is something that's pervasive and yet not taught in schools

1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:25.120
 not taught in engineering schools where everything's minutely modularized to make sure that we

1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:30.440
 never deviate from, you know, whatever signal we're trying to emit, as opposed to let all

1:57:30.440 --> 1:57:34.000
 hell breaks loose because that's the, that's the path to paradise.

1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:35.000
 The path to paradise.

1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:36.000
 Yeah.

1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:39.280
 I mean, it's difficult to know how to teach that and what to do with it.

1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:45.720
 I mean, it's, it's difficult to know how to build up a sign, the scientific method around

1:57:45.720 --> 1:57:46.720
 messiness.

1:57:46.720 --> 1:57:49.960
 I mean, it's not all messiness.

1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:52.120
 We need, we need some cleanness.

1:57:52.120 --> 1:57:57.000
 And going back to the example with Mars, that's probably the place where I want to sort of

1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:01.120
 moderate error as much as possible and sort of control the environment as much as possible.

1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:06.520
 But if you're trying to repopulate Mars, well, maybe messing is a good thing then.

1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:13.480
 On that, you quickly mentioned this in terms of us using our vocal cords to speak on a

1:58:13.480 --> 1:58:22.720
 podcast, so Elon Musk and Neuralink are working on trying to plug as per our discussion with

1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:29.360
 computers and biological systems to connect it to, he's trying to connect our brain to

1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:36.320
 a computer to create a brain computer interface where they can communicate back and forth.

1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:43.560
 On this line of thinking, do you think this is possible to bridge the gap between our engineered

1:58:43.560 --> 1:58:49.400
 computing systems and the messy biological systems?

1:58:49.400 --> 1:58:52.040
 My answer would be absolutely.

1:58:52.040 --> 1:58:55.600
 We, we, you know, there's no doubt that we can understand more and more about what goes

1:58:55.600 --> 1:59:00.280
 on in the brain and we can sort of train the brain.

1:59:00.280 --> 1:59:02.840
 I don't know if you remember the Palm pilot.

1:59:02.840 --> 1:59:03.840
 Yeah.

1:59:03.840 --> 1:59:04.840
 Palm pilot.

1:59:04.840 --> 1:59:07.640
 Do you remember this whole sort of alphabet that they had created?

1:59:07.640 --> 1:59:11.040
 Am I thinking of the same thing?

1:59:11.040 --> 1:59:16.800
 It's basically you had, you had a little pen and for every character you had a little scribble

1:59:16.800 --> 1:59:22.880
 that was unique that the machine could understand and that instead of trying the machine, trying

1:59:22.880 --> 1:59:27.400
 to teach the machine to recognize human characters, you had basically, they figured out that it's

1:59:27.400 --> 1:59:32.520
 better and easier to train humans to create human like characters that the machine is

1:59:32.520 --> 1:59:34.920
 better at recognizing.

1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:41.000
 So in the same way, I think what will happen is that humans will be trained to be able

1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:46.680
 to create the mind pattern that the machine will respond to before the machine truly comprehends

1:59:46.680 --> 1:59:47.880
 our thoughts.

1:59:47.880 --> 1:59:53.600
 So the first human brain interfaces will be tricking humans to speak the machine language

1:59:53.600 --> 1:59:58.000
 where with the right set of electrodes, I can sort of trick my brain into doing this.

1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:03.080
 And this is the same way that many people teach, like learn to control artificial limbs.

2:00:03.080 --> 2:00:07.040
 You basically try a bunch of stuff and eventually you figure out how your limbs work.

2:00:07.040 --> 2:00:11.560
 That might not be very different from how humans learn to use their natural limbs when

2:00:11.560 --> 2:00:13.360
 they first grow up.

2:00:13.360 --> 2:00:20.400
 Basically you have these, you know, neoteny period of, you know, this puddle of soup inside

2:00:20.400 --> 2:00:25.720
 your brain trying to figure out how to even make neural connections before you're born.

2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:34.400
 And then learning sounds in utero of, you know, all kinds of echoes and, you know, eventually

2:00:34.400 --> 2:00:35.920
 getting out in the real world.

2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:39.960
 And I don't know if you've seen newborns, but they just stare around a lot.

2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:43.480
 You know, one way to think about this as a machine learning person is, oh, they're just

2:00:43.480 --> 2:00:46.240
 training their edge detectors.

2:00:46.240 --> 2:00:48.720
 And eventually they figure out how to train their edge detectors.

2:00:48.720 --> 2:00:51.760
 They work through the second layer of the visual cortex and the third layer and so on

2:00:51.760 --> 2:00:53.000
 so forth.

2:00:53.000 --> 2:01:00.240
 And you basically have this learning how to control your limbs that probably comes at

2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:01.240
 the same time.

2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:04.840
 You're sort of, you know, throwing random things there and you realize that, oh, wow,

2:01:04.840 --> 2:01:08.360
 when I do this thing, my limb moves.

2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:09.360
 Let's do the following experiment.

2:01:09.360 --> 2:01:12.040
 Take a breath.

2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:13.600
 What muscles did you flex?

2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:16.800
 Now take another breath and think what muscles do I flex?

2:01:16.800 --> 2:01:21.520
 The first thing that you're thinking when you're taking a breath is the impact that

2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:22.520
 it has on your lungs.

2:01:22.520 --> 2:01:25.560
 You're like, oh, I'm now going to increase my lungs or I'm not going to bring air in.

2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:29.400
 But what you're actually doing is just changing your diaphragm.

2:01:29.400 --> 2:01:32.000
 That's not conscious, of course.

2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:35.240
 You never think of the diaphragm as a thing.

2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:36.240
 And why is that?

2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:39.480
 That's probably the same reason why I think of moving my finger when I actually move my

2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:40.560
 finger.

2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:44.560
 I think of the effect instead of actually thinking of whatever muscle is twitching that actually

2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:46.600
 causes my finger to move.

2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:53.160
 So we basically, in our first years of life, build up this massive lookup table between

2:01:53.160 --> 2:02:01.040
 whatever neuronal firing we do and whatever action happens in our body that we control.

2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:05.760
 If you have a kid grow up with a third limb, I'm sure they'll figure out how to control

2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:09.680
 them probably at the same rate as their natural limbs.

2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:15.920
 And a lot of the work would be done by the, if a third limb is a computer, you kind of

2:02:15.920 --> 2:02:24.440
 have a, not a faith, but a thought that the brain might be able to figure out, like the

2:02:24.440 --> 2:02:28.560
 plasticity would come from the brain, like the brain would be cleverer than the machine

2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:29.560
 at first.

2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:32.700
 When I talk about a third limb, that's exactly what I'm saying, an artificial limb that basically

2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:36.640
 just controls your mouse while you're typing, you know, perfectly natural thing.

2:02:36.640 --> 2:02:42.000
 I mean, again, you know, in a few hundred years, maybe sooner than that.

2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:47.680
 But basically, there's, as long as the machine is consistent in the way that it will respond

2:02:47.680 --> 2:02:52.480
 to your brain impulses, you'll figure out how to control that and you could play tennis

2:02:52.480 --> 2:02:54.320
 with your third limb.

2:02:54.320 --> 2:02:57.840
 And let me go back to consistency.

2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:04.080
 People who have dramatic accidents that basically take out a whole chunk of their brain can

2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:08.640
 be taught to coopt other parts of the brain to then control that part.

2:03:08.640 --> 2:03:13.160
 You can basically build up that tissue again and eventually train your body how to walk

2:03:13.160 --> 2:03:16.440
 again and how to read again and how to play again and how to think again, how to speak

2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:18.240
 a language again, et cetera.

2:03:18.240 --> 2:03:24.800
 So there's a massive amount of malleability that happens, you know, naturally in our way

2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:31.160
 of controlling our body, our brain, our thoughts, our vocal cords, our limbs, et cetera.

2:03:31.160 --> 2:03:37.160
 And human machine interfaces are all inevitable if we sort of figure out how to read these

2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:39.480
 electric impulses.

2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:46.680
 But the resolution at which we can understand human thought right now is nil, is ridiculous.

2:03:46.680 --> 2:03:48.840
 So how are human thoughts encoded?

2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:55.040
 It's basically combinations of neurons that cofire and these create these things called

2:03:55.040 --> 2:03:59.080
 engrams that eventually form memories and so on and so forth.

2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:02.080
 We know nothing of all that stuff.

2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:06.920
 So before we can actually read into your brain that you want to build a program that does

2:04:06.920 --> 2:04:11.120
 this and this and that, we need a lot of neuroscience.

2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:17.320
 Well, so to push back on that, do you think it's possible that without understanding the

2:04:17.320 --> 2:04:22.360
 functionally about the brain or from the neuroscience or the cognitive science or psychology, whichever

2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:28.400
 level of the brain we look at, do you think we just connect them just like per your previous

2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:29.400
 point?

2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:34.440
 If we just have a high enough resolution between connection between Wikipedia and your brain,

2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:38.360
 the brain will just figure it out without understanding.

2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:43.440
 Because that's one of the innovations of Neuralink is they're increasing the number of connections

2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:48.360
 to the brain to like several thousand, which before was, you know, in the dozens or whatever.

2:04:48.360 --> 2:04:53.240
 You're still off by a few orders of magnitude on the order of seven.

2:04:53.240 --> 2:04:54.240
 Right.

2:04:54.240 --> 2:04:59.120
 But the thing is, the hope is if you increase that number more and more and more, maybe you

2:04:59.120 --> 2:05:04.520
 don't need to understand anything about the actual, how human thought is represented in

2:05:04.520 --> 2:05:05.520
 the brain.

2:05:05.520 --> 2:05:08.280
 You can just let it, let it figure it out by itself.

2:05:08.280 --> 2:05:11.120
 Yeah, Keanu Reeves waking up and saying, I know cook food.

2:05:11.120 --> 2:05:12.120
 Yeah, exactly.

2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:13.120
 Yeah.

2:05:13.120 --> 2:05:14.120
 Exactly.

2:05:14.120 --> 2:05:15.120
 So yeah, sure.

2:05:15.120 --> 2:05:18.440
 You don't have faith in the, the plasticity of the brain to that degree.

2:05:18.440 --> 2:05:19.960
 It's not about brain plasticity.

2:05:19.960 --> 2:05:21.520
 It's about the input aspect.

2:05:21.520 --> 2:05:25.480
 Basically, I think on the output aspect, being able to control a machine is something that

2:05:25.480 --> 2:05:31.480
 you can probably train your neural impulses that you're sending out to sort of match whatever

2:05:31.480 --> 2:05:33.360
 response you see in the environment.

2:05:33.360 --> 2:05:37.000
 If this thing moved every single time I thought, a particular thought, then I could figure

2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:40.920
 out, I could hack my way into moving this thing with just a series of thoughts.

2:05:40.920 --> 2:05:47.640
 I could think guitar, piano, tennis ball, and then this thing would be moving.

2:05:47.640 --> 2:05:51.840
 And then, you know, I would just have the series of thoughts that would sort of result

2:05:51.840 --> 2:05:53.920
 in the impulses that will move this thing the way that I want.

2:05:53.920 --> 2:05:56.920
 And then eventually it'll become natural because I won't even think about it.

2:05:56.920 --> 2:06:00.920
 I mean, in the same way that we control our limbs in a very natural way, but babies don't

2:06:00.920 --> 2:06:01.920
 do that.

2:06:01.920 --> 2:06:03.440
 Babies have to figure it out.

2:06:03.440 --> 2:06:07.360
 And you know, some of it is hard coded, but some of it is actually learned based on the

2:06:07.360 --> 2:06:13.560
 whatever soup of neurons you ended up with, whatever connections you pruned them to, and

2:06:13.560 --> 2:06:15.240
 eventually you were born with.

2:06:15.240 --> 2:06:19.880
 You know, a lot of that is coded in the genome, but a huge chunk of that is stochastic instead

2:06:19.880 --> 2:06:23.440
 of the way that you sort of create all these neurons that migrate, they form connections,

2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:26.800
 they sort of, you know, spread out, they have particular branching patterns, but then the

2:06:26.800 --> 2:06:31.400
 connectivity itself, unique in every single new person.

2:06:31.400 --> 2:06:37.200
 All this to say that on the output side, absolutely, I'm very, very, you know, hopeful

2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:42.520
 that we can have machines that read thousands of these neuronal connections on the output

2:06:42.520 --> 2:06:51.520
 side, but on the input side, oh boy, I don't expect any time in the near future we'll be

2:06:51.520 --> 2:06:56.520
 able to sort of send a series of impulses that will tell me, oh, earth to sun distance,

2:06:56.520 --> 2:07:00.640
 7.5 million, et cetera, like nowhere.

2:07:00.640 --> 2:07:06.400
 I mean, I think language will still be the input way rather than sort of any kind of

2:07:06.400 --> 2:07:07.400
 more complex.

2:07:07.400 --> 2:07:12.760
 It's a really interesting notion that the ambiguity of language is a feature.

2:07:12.760 --> 2:07:20.600
 And we evolved for millions of years to take advantage of that ambiguity.

2:07:20.600 --> 2:07:26.560
 And yet no one teaches us the subtle differences between words that are near cognates and yet

2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:30.880
 evokes so much more than, you know, one from the other.

2:07:30.880 --> 2:07:37.600
 And yet, you know, when you're choosing words from a list of 20 synonyms, you know exactly

2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:40.120
 the connotation of every single one of them.

2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:42.920
 And that's something that, you know, is there.

2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:46.840
 So yes, there's ambiguity, but there's all kinds of connotations.

2:07:46.840 --> 2:07:51.360
 And in the way that we select our words, we have so much baggage that we're sending along,

2:07:51.360 --> 2:07:56.080
 the way that we're emoting, the way that we're moving our hands every single time we speak,

2:07:56.080 --> 2:08:00.800
 the, you know, the pauses, the eye contact, et cetera, so much higher bar rate than just

2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:03.920
 a vocal, you know, string of characters.

2:08:03.920 --> 2:08:07.080
 Well, let me just take a small tangent on that.

2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:08.080
 Oh, tangent.

2:08:08.080 --> 2:08:09.080
 We haven't done that yet.

2:08:09.080 --> 2:08:10.080
 That's a good idea.

2:08:10.080 --> 2:08:11.080
 Let's just tangent.

2:08:11.080 --> 2:08:16.360
 We'll return to the origin of life after.

2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:22.320
 So I mean, you're Greek, but I'm going on this personal journey.

2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:29.920
 I'm going to Paris for the explicit purpose of talking to one of the most famous, a couple

2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:35.280
 who's a famous translators of Russian literature, Dostoevsky Tolstoy.

2:08:35.280 --> 2:08:43.200
 And they go, that's their art is the translation and everything I've learned about the translation

2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:53.720
 art, it makes me feel it's so profound in a way that's so much more profound than the

2:08:53.720 --> 2:08:57.840
 natural language processing papers I read in the machine learning community, that there's

2:08:57.840 --> 2:09:03.120
 such depth to language that I don't know what to do with.

2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:08.720
 I don't know if you've experienced that in your own life with knowing multiple languages.

2:09:08.720 --> 2:09:11.800
 I don't know what to, I don't know how to make sense of it.

2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:16.880
 But there's so much loss in translation between Russian and English and getting a sense of

2:09:16.880 --> 2:09:17.880
 that.

2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:24.120
 Like for example, there's like just taking a single sentence from Dostoevsky and like

2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:25.880
 there's a lot of them.

2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:30.280
 You could talk for hours about how to translate that sentence properly.

2:09:30.280 --> 2:09:37.240
 That captures the meaning, the period, the culture, the humor, the wit, the suffering

2:09:37.240 --> 2:09:43.080
 that was in the context of the time, all of that could be a single sentence.

2:09:43.080 --> 2:09:47.120
 You could talk forever about what it takes to translate that correctly.

2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:48.840
 I don't know what to do with that.

2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:55.880
 So being Greek, it's very hard for me to think of a sentence or even a word without going

2:09:55.880 --> 2:10:04.920
 into the full etymology of that word, breaking up every single atom of that sentence and

2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:09.760
 every single atom of these words and rebuilding it back up.

2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:16.720
 I have three kids and the way that I teach them Greek is the same way that the documentary

2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:24.320
 I was mentioning earlier about understanding the deep roots of all of these words.

2:10:24.320 --> 2:10:32.080
 And it's very interesting that every single time I hear a new word that I've never heard

2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:35.840
 before, I go and figure out the etymology of that word because I will never appreciate

2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:39.520
 that word without understanding how it was initially formed.

2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:40.520
 Interesting.

2:10:40.520 --> 2:10:42.320
 But how does that help?

2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:43.800
 Because that's not the full picture.

2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:45.000
 No, no, of course, of course.

2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:50.400
 But what I'm trying to say is that knowing the components teaches you about the context

2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:55.280
 of the formation of that word and sort of the original usage of that word.

2:10:55.280 --> 2:11:01.200
 And then of course, the word takes new meaning as you create it from its parts.

2:11:01.200 --> 2:11:04.280
 And that meaning then gets augmented.

2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:09.240
 And two synonyms that sort of have different roots will actually have implications that

2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:14.280
 carry a lot of that baggage of the historical provenance of these words.

2:11:14.280 --> 2:11:20.240
 So before working on genome evolution, my passion was evolution of language and sort

2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:27.440
 of tracing cognates across different languages through their etymologies.

2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:33.520
 And that's fascinating that there's parallels between, I mean, the idea that there's evolutionary

2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:36.440
 dynamics through our language.

2:11:36.440 --> 2:11:38.560
 Yeah.

2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:44.200
 Every single word that you utter, parallels, parallels, what does parallels mean?

2:11:44.200 --> 2:11:50.760
 Para means side by side, alleles from alleles, which means identical twins, parallels.

2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:57.560
 I mean, name any word, and there's so much baggage, so much beauty in how that word came

2:11:57.560 --> 2:12:02.320
 to be and how this word took a new meaning than the sum of its parts.

2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:08.920
 Yeah, and they're just words, they don't have any physical grounding.

2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:13.720
 And now you take these words and you weave them into a sentence.

2:12:13.720 --> 2:12:19.400
 The emotional invocations of that weaving are fathomless.

2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:25.600
 And all of those emotions all live in the brains of humans.

2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:31.040
 In the eye of the beholder, no, seriously, you have to embrace this concept of the eye

2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:33.040
 of the beholder.

2:12:33.040 --> 2:12:39.720
 It's the conceptualization that nothing takes meaning with one person creating it.

2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:42.720
 Everything takes meaning in the receiving end.

2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:49.880
 The emergent properties of these communication networks where every single, if you look at

2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:54.280
 the network of our cells and how they're communicating with each other, every cell has its own code.

2:12:54.280 --> 2:12:56.280
 This code is modulated by the epigenome.

2:12:56.280 --> 2:12:58.080
 This creates a bunch of different cell types.

2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:01.800
 Each cell type now has its own identity, yet they all have the common root of the stem

2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:04.880
 cells that sort of led to them.

2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:08.240
 Each of these identities is now communicating with each other.

2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:11.920
 They take meaning in their interaction.

2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:16.160
 There's an emergent property that comes from a bunch of cells being together that is not

2:13:16.160 --> 2:13:17.480
 in any one of the parts.

2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:23.400
 If you look at neurons communicating, again, these engrams don't exist in any one neuron.

2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:26.600
 They exist in the connection, in the combination of neurons.

2:13:26.600 --> 2:13:33.480
 And the meaning of the words that I'm telling you is empty until it reaches you and it affects

2:13:33.480 --> 2:13:38.920
 you in a very different way than it affects whoever's listening to this conversation now.

2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:42.360
 Because of the emotional baggage that I've grown up with, that you've grown up with,

2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:44.480
 and that they've grown up with.

2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:47.880
 And that's, I think, the magic of translation.

2:13:47.880 --> 2:13:56.560
 If you start thinking of translation as just simply capturing that emotional set of reactions

2:13:56.560 --> 2:14:02.560
 that you evoke, you need a different set of words to evoke that same set of reactions

2:14:02.560 --> 2:14:07.400
 to a French person than to a Russian person because of the baggage of the culture that

2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:08.400
 we grew up in.

2:14:08.400 --> 2:14:09.400
 Yeah.

2:14:09.400 --> 2:14:13.800
 So basically, you shouldn't find the best word.

2:14:13.800 --> 2:14:19.440
 Sometimes it's a completely different sentence structure that you will need matched to the

2:14:19.440 --> 2:14:24.760
 cultural context of the target audience that you have.

2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:30.600
 I usually don't think about this, but right now there's this feeling, as a reminder, there's

2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:35.720
 just you and I talking, but there's several hundred thousand people who will listen to

2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:36.720
 this.

2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:44.160
 There's a guy in Russia right now running, like in Moscow, listening to us.

2:14:44.160 --> 2:14:48.480
 There's somebody in India, I guarantee you, there's somebody in China and South America.

2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:54.040
 There's somebody in Texas, and they all have different emotional baggage.

2:14:54.040 --> 2:15:00.320
 They probably got angry earlier on about the whole discussion about coronavirus and about

2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:02.000
 some aspect of it.

2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:06.960
 Yeah, and there's that network effect.

2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:11.240
 It's a beautiful thing, and these lateral transfer of information, that's what makes

2:15:11.240 --> 2:15:19.960
 the collective, quote unquote, genome of humanity so unique from any other species.

2:15:19.960 --> 2:15:25.040
 So you somehow miraculously wrapped it back to the very beginning of when we were talking

2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:29.160
 about the beauty of the human genome.

2:15:29.160 --> 2:15:34.880
 So I think this is the right time, unless we want to go for a six to eight hour conversation.

2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:39.640
 We're going to have to talk again, but I think for now, to wrap it up, this is the right

2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:46.000
 time to talk about the biggest, most ridiculous question of all, meaning of life.

2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:56.120
 Off mic, you mentioned to me that you had your 42nd birthday, 42nd being a very special,

2:15:56.120 --> 2:16:03.560
 absurdly special number, and you had to kind of get together with friends to discuss the

2:16:03.560 --> 2:16:04.560
 meaning of life.

2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:13.840
 So let me ask you, as a biologist, as a computer scientist, and as a human, what is the meaning

2:16:13.840 --> 2:16:15.640
 of life?

2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:21.440
 I've been asking this question for a long time, ever since my 42nd birthday, but well

2:16:21.440 --> 2:16:29.080
 before that, in even planning the meaning of life symposium, and symposium, symp means

2:16:29.080 --> 2:16:34.560
 together, posi actually means to drink together, so symposium is actually a drinking party.

2:16:34.560 --> 2:16:39.560
 Can you actually elaborate about this meaning of life symposium that you put together?

2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:42.360
 It's like the most genius idea I've ever heard.

2:16:42.360 --> 2:16:46.120
 So 42 is obviously the answer to life, the universe, and everything from the Hitchhackers

2:16:46.120 --> 2:16:48.120
 guy to the galaxy.

2:16:48.120 --> 2:16:51.840
 And as I was turning 42, I've had the theme for every one of my birthdays.

2:16:51.840 --> 2:17:00.160
 When I was turning 32, it's 10000 in binary, so I celebrated my 100,000th binary birthday,

2:17:00.160 --> 2:17:06.440
 and I had a theme of going back 100,000 years, you know, let's dress something in the last

2:17:06.440 --> 2:17:07.440
 100,000 years.

2:17:07.440 --> 2:17:09.640
 Anyway, I've always had these...

2:17:09.640 --> 2:17:12.240
 It's such an interesting human being.

2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:13.240
 Okay, that's awesome.

2:17:13.240 --> 2:17:21.840
 I've always had these sort of numerology related announcements for my birthday party.

2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:29.520
 So what came out of that meaning of life symposium is that I basically asked 42 of my colleagues,

2:17:29.520 --> 2:17:36.280
 42 of my friends, 42 of my collaborators to basically give seven minute species on the

2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:38.840
 meaning of life, each from their perspective.

2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:44.120
 And I really encourage you to go there because it's mind boggling that every single person

2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:46.400
 said a different answer.

2:17:46.400 --> 2:17:51.000
 Every single person started with, I don't know what the meaning of life is, but, and

2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:55.840
 then give this beautifully eloquently answer, eloquently answer.

2:17:55.840 --> 2:18:01.960
 And they were all different, but they all were consistent with each other and mutually

2:18:01.960 --> 2:18:07.080
 synergistic and together forming a beautiful view of what it means to be human in many

2:18:07.080 --> 2:18:08.760
 ways.

2:18:08.760 --> 2:18:13.680
 Some people talked about the loss of their loved one, their life partner for many, many

2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:16.680
 years, and how their life changed through that.

2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:19.400
 Some people talked about the origin of life.

2:18:19.400 --> 2:18:24.160
 Some people talked about the difference between purpose and meaning.

2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:31.120
 I'll maybe quote one of the answers, which is this linguistics professor, a friend of

2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:36.720
 mine at Harvard, who basically said that she was gonna...

2:18:36.720 --> 2:18:40.160
 She's Greek as well, and she said, I will give a very Pythian answer.

2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:45.400
 So Pythia was the oracle of Delphi, who would basically give these very cryptic answers,

2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:47.920
 very short, but interpretable in many different ways.

2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:53.840
 There was this whole set of priests who were tasked with interpreting what Pythia had said,

2:18:53.840 --> 2:18:59.160
 and very often you would not get a clean interpretation, but she said, I will be like Pythian, give

2:18:59.160 --> 2:19:04.400
 you a very short and multiply interpretable answer, but unlike her, I will actually also

2:19:04.400 --> 2:19:07.120
 give you three interpretations.

2:19:07.120 --> 2:19:12.920
 And she said, the answer to the meaning of life is become one.

2:19:12.920 --> 2:19:18.720
 And the first interpretation is, like a child, become one year old with the excitement of

2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:21.640
 discovering everything about the world.

2:19:21.640 --> 2:19:29.240
 Second interpretation, in whatever you take on, become one, the first, the best, excel,

2:19:29.240 --> 2:19:36.440
 drive yourself to perfection for every one of your tasks, and become one when people

2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:42.960
 are separate, become one, come together, learn to understand each other.

2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:45.720
 Damn, that's an answer.

2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:51.280
 And one way to summarize this whole meaning of life symposium is that the very symposium

2:19:51.280 --> 2:19:58.240
 was illustrating the quest for meaning, which might itself be the meaning of life.

2:19:58.240 --> 2:20:06.520
 This constant quest for something sublime, something human, something intangible, some

2:20:06.520 --> 2:20:13.720
 aspect of what defines us as a species and as an individual, both a quest of me as a

2:20:13.720 --> 2:20:20.200
 person through my own life, but the meaning of life could also be the meaning of all of

2:20:20.200 --> 2:20:24.800
 life, what is the whole point of life, why life, why life itself, because we've been

2:20:24.800 --> 2:20:30.080
 talking about the history and evolution of life, but we haven't talked about why life

2:20:30.080 --> 2:20:36.680
 in the first place, is life inevitable, is life part of physics, does life transcend

2:20:36.680 --> 2:20:42.880
 physics, but by fighting against entropy, by compartmentalizing and increasing concentrations

2:20:42.880 --> 2:20:53.160
 rather than diluting away, is life a distinct entity in the universe beyond the traditional

2:20:53.160 --> 2:21:00.840
 very simple physical rules that govern gravity and electromagnetism and all of these forces,

2:21:00.840 --> 2:21:05.400
 is life another force, is there a life force, is there a unique kind of set of principles

2:21:05.400 --> 2:21:10.000
 that emerge, of course, built on top of the hardware of physics, but is it sort of a new

2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:14.720
 layer of software or a new layer of a computer system?

2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:18.560
 So that's at the level of big questions.

2:21:18.560 --> 2:21:27.920
 There's another aspect of gratitude, of basically what I like to say is during this pandemic,

2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:33.520
 I've basically worked from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. every single day nonstop, including Saturday

2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:34.520
 and Sunday.

2:21:34.520 --> 2:21:42.400
 I've basically broken all boundaries of where life, personal life begins and work life ends.

2:21:42.400 --> 2:21:51.160
 And that has been exhilarating for me, just the intellectual pleasure that I get from

2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:57.080
 a day of exhaustion, where at the end of the day, my brain is hurting, I'm telling my wife,

2:21:57.080 --> 2:22:00.800
 wow, I was useful today.

2:22:00.800 --> 2:22:08.480
 And there's a certain pleasure that comes from feeling useful.

2:22:08.480 --> 2:22:12.560
 And there's a certain pleasure that comes from feeling grateful.

2:22:12.560 --> 2:22:19.600
 So I've written this little sort of prayer for my kids to say at bedtime every night,

2:22:19.600 --> 2:22:26.800
 where they basically say, thank you, God, for all you have given me and give me the strength

2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:33.320
 to give unto others with the same love that you have given unto me.

2:22:33.320 --> 2:22:40.960
 Me as a species are so special, the only ones who worry about the meaning of life.

2:22:40.960 --> 2:22:44.920
 And maybe that's what makes us human.

2:22:44.920 --> 2:22:53.400
 And what I like to say to my wife and to my students during this pandemic, work extravaganza,

2:22:53.400 --> 2:22:56.440
 is every now and then they ask me, but how do you do this?

2:22:56.440 --> 2:22:58.840
 And I'm like, I'm a workaholic.

2:22:58.840 --> 2:23:00.960
 I love this.

2:23:00.960 --> 2:23:04.840
 This is me in the most unfiltered way.

2:23:04.840 --> 2:23:10.560
 The ability to do something useful, to feel that my brain is being used, to interact with

2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:15.800
 the smartest people on the planet day in, day out, and to help them discover aspects

2:23:15.800 --> 2:23:22.040
 of the human genome, of the human brain, of human disease and the human condition that

2:23:22.040 --> 2:23:30.000
 no one has seen before with data that we're capturing that has never been observed.

2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:34.640
 And that's another aspect which is on the personal life.

2:23:34.640 --> 2:23:36.200
 Many people say, oh, I'm not going to have kids.

2:23:36.200 --> 2:23:37.520
 Why bother?

2:23:37.520 --> 2:23:46.200
 I can tell you as a father, they're missing half the picture, if not the whole picture.

2:23:46.200 --> 2:23:53.120
 Teaching my kids about my view of the world and watching through their eyes the naivete

2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:58.440
 with which they start and the sophistication with which they end up.

2:23:58.440 --> 2:24:06.600
 The understanding that they have of not just the natural world around them, but of me too.

2:24:06.600 --> 2:24:16.760
 The unfiltered criticism that you get from your own children that knows no bounds of

2:24:16.760 --> 2:24:19.400
 honesty.

2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:28.000
 And I've grown components of my heart that I didn't know I had until you sense that fragility

2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:41.320
 that vulnerability of the children, that immense love and passion, the unfiltered egoism that

2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:44.480
 we as adults learn how to hide so much better.

2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:51.680
 It's just this back of emotions that tell me about the raw materials that make a human

2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:57.160
 being and how these raw materials can be arranged with more sophistication that we learn through

2:24:57.160 --> 2:25:02.280
 life to become truly human adults.

2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:08.040
 But there's something so beautiful about seeing that progression between them, the complexity

2:25:08.040 --> 2:25:16.720
 of the language growing as more neural connections are formed to realize that the hardware is

2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:22.760
 getting rearranged as their software is getting implemented on that hardware.

2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:28.080
 But their frontal cortex continues to grow for another 10 years.

2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:32.160
 There's neural connections that are continuing to form, new neurons that actually get replicated

2:25:32.160 --> 2:25:34.160
 and formed.

2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:40.760
 It's just incredible that we have these, not just you grow the hardware for 30 years and

2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:45.420
 then you feed it all of the knowledge, no, no, the knowledge is fed throughout and is

2:25:45.420 --> 2:25:48.640
 shaping these neural connections as they're forming.

2:25:48.640 --> 2:25:54.680
 So seeing that transformation from either your own blood or from an adopted child is

2:25:54.680 --> 2:25:57.640
 the most beautiful thing you can do as a human being.

2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:03.320
 And it completes you, it completes that path, that journey, the create life, oh sure, that's

2:26:03.320 --> 2:26:09.840
 that conception, that's easy, but create human life to add the human part that takes decades

2:26:09.840 --> 2:26:19.000
 of compassion, of sharing, of love and of anger and of impatience and patience.

2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:26.160
 And as a parent, I think I've become a very different kind of teacher.

2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:32.600
 Because again, I'm a professor, my first role is to bring adult human beings into a more

2:26:32.600 --> 2:26:38.600
 mature level of adulthood where they learn not just to do science, but they learn the

2:26:38.600 --> 2:26:43.840
 process of discovery and the process of collaboration, the process of sharing, the process of conveying

2:26:43.840 --> 2:26:49.960
 the knowledge of encapsulating something incredibly complex and sort of giving it up in sort

2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:54.400
 of bite sized chunks that the rest of humanity can appreciate.

2:26:54.400 --> 2:27:01.360
 I tell my students all the time, when a tree falls in the forest and no one's there to

2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:03.080
 listen, has it really fallen?

2:27:03.080 --> 2:27:06.880
 The same way, you do this awesome research, if you write an impenetrable paper that no

2:27:06.880 --> 2:27:11.160
 one will understand, it's as if you never did the awesome research.

2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:15.840
 So conveying of knowledge, conveying this lateral transfer that I was talking about

2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:22.600
 at the very beginning of sort of humanity and sort of the sharing of information, all

2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:32.560
 of that has gotten so much more rich by seeing human beings grow in my own home.

2:27:32.560 --> 2:27:37.300
 Because that makes me a better parent and that makes me a better teacher and a better

2:27:37.300 --> 2:27:43.400
 mentor to the nurturing of my adult children, which are my research group.

2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:51.520
 First of all, beautifully put, connects beautifully to the vertical and the horizontal inheritance

2:27:51.520 --> 2:27:54.320
 of ideas that we talked about at the very beginning.

2:27:54.320 --> 2:28:00.840
 I don't think there's a better way to end it on this poetic and powerful note.

2:28:00.840 --> 2:28:03.040
 Manolis, thank you so much for talking to us.

2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:04.040
 A huge honor.

2:28:04.040 --> 2:28:11.960
 We'll have to talk again about the origin of life, about epigenetics, epigenomics, and

2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:13.720
 some of the incredible research you're doing.

2:28:13.720 --> 2:28:14.720
 Truly an honor.

2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:15.720
 Thanks so much for talking to us.

2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:16.720
 Thank you.

2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:17.720
 Such a pleasure.

2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:18.720
 It's such a pleasure.

2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:19.720
 I mean, your questions are outstanding.

2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:20.720
 I've had such a blast here.

2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:21.720
 I can't wait to be back.

2:28:21.720 --> 2:28:22.720

 And now let me leave you with some words from Charles Darwin that I think Manolis represents

2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:01.600
 quite beautifully.

2:29:01.600 --> 2:29:07.920
 If I had my life to live over again, I would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen

2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:11.800
 to some music at least once every week.

2:29:11.800 --> 2:29:26.600
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
