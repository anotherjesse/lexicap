00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
 Where are the darkest places you've ever gone in your life?

00:07.400 --> 00:12.640
 The following is a conversation with Carl Diceroth, professor of bioengineering, psychiatry,

00:12.640 --> 00:15.680
 and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.560
 He's one of the greatest living psychiatrists and neuroscientists in the world.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.640
 He's also just a fascinating human being.

00:23.640 --> 00:28.720
 We discuss both the darkest and the most beautiful places that the human mind can take us.

00:28.720 --> 00:33.840
 He explores this in his book called Projections, A Story of Human Emotions.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.960
 I highly recommend it.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.600
 It's written masterfully.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.360
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.520
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:43.520 --> 00:48.240
 And now, dear friends, here's Carl Diceroth.

00:48.240 --> 00:53.440
 You open your book called Projections, A Story of Human Emotions with a few beautiful words

00:53.440 --> 00:56.200
 to summarize all of humanity.

00:56.200 --> 01:01.320
 The book draws insights about the human mind from modern psychiatry and neuroscience.

01:01.320 --> 01:05.120
 So if it's okay, let me read a few sentences from the opening.

01:05.120 --> 01:09.000
 You got to give props to beautiful writing when I see it.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.840
 Quote, In the art of weaving, warp threads are structural and strong and anchored at

01:15.840 --> 01:22.160
 the origin, creating a frame for crossing fibers as the fabric is woven.

01:22.160 --> 01:26.920
 Projecting across the advancing edge into free space, warp threads bridge the formed

01:26.920 --> 01:32.280
 past to the ragged present to the yet featureless future.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.840
 Yet featureless future, well done, well done, sir.

01:35.840 --> 01:40.360
 The tapestry of the human story has its own warp threads, rooted deep in the gorges of

01:40.360 --> 01:46.560
 East Africa, connecting the shifting textures of human life over millions of years.

01:46.560 --> 01:54.040
 Expanding pictographs backdropped by crevice ice, by angulated forestry, by stone and steel

01:54.040 --> 01:59.760
 and by glowing rare earths, the inner workings of the mind give form to these threads, creating

01:59.760 --> 02:06.240
 a framework within us, upon which the story of each individual can come into being.

02:06.240 --> 02:11.360
 Personal grain and color arise from the cross threads of our moments and experiences, the

02:11.360 --> 02:17.400
 fine weft of life, embedding and obscuring the underlying scaffold with intricate and

02:17.400 --> 02:19.920
 sometimes lovely detail.

02:19.920 --> 02:25.660
 Here are stories of this fabric fraying in those who are ill, in the minds of people

02:25.660 --> 02:31.320
 for whom the warp is exposed and raw and revealing.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.880
 What have you learned about human beings, human nature and the human mind, from those

02:34.880 --> 02:41.240
 who suffer from psychiatric maladies, for those for whom this fabric is warped?

02:41.240 --> 02:48.520
 And one thing we learn as biologists is that when something breaks, you see what the original

02:48.520 --> 02:50.880
 unbroken part was for.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.120
 And we see this in genetics, we see this in biochemistry.

02:54.120 --> 02:59.800
 It's known that when you have a mutated gene, sometimes the gene is turned up in strength

02:59.800 --> 03:03.320
 or turned down in strength, and that lets you see what it was originally for.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.160
 You can infer true function from dysfunction.

03:07.160 --> 03:13.240
 And this is a theme that I thought needed to be shared and needed to be made communicable

03:13.240 --> 03:19.800
 to the lay public, to everybody, people who, which is, I think, almost all of us who think

03:19.800 --> 03:25.560
 and care about the inner workings of our minds, but who also care for those who have been

03:25.560 --> 03:32.000
 suffering, who have mental health disorders, who face challenges.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.960
 But then more broadly, it's a very much larger story than the present.

03:36.960 --> 03:42.280
 There's a story to be told where the protagonist really is the human mind.

03:42.280 --> 03:47.440
 And that was one thing I wanted to share as well in projections, is that broader story,

03:47.440 --> 03:54.040
 but still anchored in the moment of patience, of people, of experiences of the moment.

03:54.040 --> 03:59.920
 Is there a clear line between dysfunction and function, disorder and order?

03:59.920 --> 04:06.400
 This is always debated in psychiatry, probably more so than any other medical specialty.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.720
 I'm a psychiatrist.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.640
 I treat patients still.

04:09.640 --> 04:15.840
 I see acutely ill people who come to the emergency room where there's no doubt that this is

04:15.840 --> 04:21.360
 not something that's working well, where the manifestation of disease is so powerful,

04:21.360 --> 04:26.760
 where the person is suffering so greatly, where they cannot continue as they are.

04:26.760 --> 04:31.400
 But of course, it's a spectrum, and there are people who are closer to the realm of

04:31.400 --> 04:36.280
 being able to work okay in their jobs, but suffer from some small dysfunction.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.880
 And everywhere in between.

04:37.880 --> 04:42.360
 In psychiatry, we're careful to say we don't call it a disease or disorder unless there's

04:42.360 --> 04:46.440
 a disruption in social or occupational functioning.

04:46.440 --> 04:51.840
 But of course, psychiatry has a long way to go in terms of developing quantitative tests.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.720
 We don't have blood draws.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.840
 We don't have imaging studies that we can use to diagnose.

04:57.840 --> 05:02.840
 And so that line ultimately that you're asking about between order and disorder, function

05:02.840 --> 05:05.880
 and dysfunction, it's operational at the moment.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.560
 How are things working?

05:08.560 --> 05:10.920
 Can we just like linger on the terms for a second?

05:10.920 --> 05:18.040
 So this disease, dysfunction, how careful should we be using those words?

05:18.040 --> 05:24.760
 Can we just, even in this conversation, from a sort of technical perspective, but also

05:24.760 --> 05:35.680
 human perspective, how quick should we be in saying that schizophrenia, depression,

05:35.680 --> 05:46.280
 autism, as we kind of go down across the spectrum of different maladies, just to use the word

05:46.280 --> 05:48.680
 dysfunction and disease?

05:48.680 --> 05:53.240
 I would say to give ourselves a license to capture the whole spectrum, let's say disorder,

05:53.240 --> 05:58.640
 because that captures truly, I think, the essence of it, which is we need to talk about

05:58.640 --> 06:01.040
 it when it's not working, when there's disorder.

06:01.040 --> 06:08.120
 And that's the fairest and most inclusive term to use.

06:08.120 --> 06:15.400
 So is it fair to assume that basically every member of the human species suffers from a

06:15.400 --> 06:17.440
 large number of disorders then?

06:17.440 --> 06:23.680
 Well, we just have to pick which ones are debilitating for each person.

06:23.680 --> 06:30.640
 If you look at the numbers, if you look at how our mental health disorders are currently

06:30.640 --> 06:35.640
 defined, you can look at population prevalence values for all these disorders.

06:35.640 --> 06:42.760
 And you can come up with estimates that somebody will have a lifetime prevalence of having

06:42.760 --> 06:48.840
 a psychiatric disorder that approaches 25% or so.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.560
 And in some studies, it could be more, some studies, it could be less.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.400
 Now, what do we do with that number?

06:53.400 --> 06:54.400
 What does that mean?

06:54.400 --> 06:59.120
 And in some ways, that's the essence of what I was hoping to approach with the book is to

06:59.120 --> 07:02.120
 reflect on this spectrum that exists for all the disorders.

07:02.120 --> 07:07.400
 There is taking nothing away from the severity and the suffering that comes at the extreme

07:07.400 --> 07:12.360
 end of these illnesses, but nearly every one of them exists on a spectrum of severity,

07:12.360 --> 07:19.400
 from nearly functional to completely dysfunctional, life threatening, and even fatal.

07:19.400 --> 07:27.720
 And so that number 25%, more or less, it doesn't capture that spectrum of severity.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.480
 Looking at that number, where do those numbers come from?

07:30.480 --> 07:31.480
 Is it self report?

07:31.480 --> 07:35.200
 Is it people who show up and say, I need help?

07:35.200 --> 07:39.040
 Is it somebody else that points out that person needs help?

07:39.040 --> 07:42.960
 Or is it like estimates that even go beyond that for people who don't ask for help or

07:42.960 --> 07:45.720
 are suffering quietly alone?

07:45.720 --> 07:51.520
 When you look at self report numbers, then those numbers get even higher, beyond 25% or

07:51.520 --> 07:53.520
 more.

07:53.520 --> 07:59.240
 The most rigorous studies are done with structured psychiatric interviews where people who are

07:59.240 --> 08:05.840
 trained in eliciting symptoms carefully do complete psychiatric inventories of individuals.

08:05.840 --> 08:10.960
 And these are time consuming, laborious studies that not often repeated.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.320
 When they're done, they're done well.

08:13.320 --> 08:19.840
 But very often you'll see a report or something in the news of a very high number for some

08:19.840 --> 08:25.360
 disorder or symptom, and very often, if it's shockingly high, that's coming from a self

08:25.360 --> 08:28.000
 report of a person.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.640
 And so that's another issue that we have, again, take nothing away from the severity

08:32.640 --> 08:37.760
 and reality and biological nature of these disorders, which are very genetic.

08:37.760 --> 08:43.520
 We understand that these are very biological, and yet we lack right now the lab tests and

08:43.520 --> 08:45.120
 the blood draws to make the diagnoses.

08:45.120 --> 08:52.600
 But we'll talk about it, just how biological they are, because that too is a mystery.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.480
 In terms of from a perspective of how to probe into the disease, how to understand it, how

08:56.480 --> 09:04.280
 to help it, so some of it could be neurobiological, some of it could be just the dance of human

09:04.280 --> 09:09.520
 emotion and interaction.

09:09.520 --> 09:15.320
 Is love when it works and is love when it breaks down, biological, or is it something

09:15.320 --> 09:16.320
 else?

09:16.320 --> 09:21.640
 We're going to talk about it, but let me just linger in terms of disorder.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.840
 What about genius?

09:23.840 --> 09:30.800
 That cliche saying like the madness and genius that they dance together.

09:30.800 --> 09:39.040
 What about if the thing we see as disorder is actually genius, unheard or misunderstood?

09:39.040 --> 09:42.560
 Here again, the numbers help us, and here's where being rigorous and quantitative actually

09:42.560 --> 09:43.560
 really helps.

09:43.560 --> 09:51.360
 If you look at disorders like autism and bipolar disorder and eating disorders, anorexia nervosa,

09:51.360 --> 09:58.880
 for example, these, particularly bipolar and anorexia, these can be fatal, they can cause

09:58.880 --> 10:06.480
 immense suffering, but they are heavily genetic, all three of these, and what's very interesting

10:06.480 --> 10:13.800
 is each one of these three is actually correlated positively, positively, with measures of intelligence,

10:13.800 --> 10:18.600
 of educational attainment, and even of income.

10:18.600 --> 10:25.320
 You look at this, severe disorders in many cases, causing quite an immense morbidity

10:25.320 --> 10:30.640
 and mortality, and yet they are positively correlated at the population level with positive

10:30.640 --> 10:31.640
 things.

10:31.640 --> 10:36.440
 Can you say the three again, autism, anorexia, and bipolar?

10:36.440 --> 10:37.440
 Bipolar disorder.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.440
 Bipolar.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.440
 What's that book?

10:39.440 --> 10:44.040
 I forgot the book name, but is intelligence a burden?

10:44.040 --> 10:49.800
 Well, people can get into trouble when they think they're smarter than they are, I will

10:49.800 --> 10:50.800
 say that.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.920
 I don't know.

10:52.920 --> 10:58.200
 Sometimes in the deepest meaning of that statement, I think ignorance is bliss.

10:58.200 --> 11:05.000
 I'm a big fan of Prince Michigan from The Idiot and Ardosh from Brother Karamazov.

11:05.000 --> 11:13.320
 It can be seen as naivety and dumbness, but I think it's a kind of deep intelligence,

11:13.320 --> 11:19.720
 maybe inability to reason about the mechanics of the world, but instead kind of feel the

11:19.720 --> 11:20.720
 world.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.400
 It seems like that's one of the paths to happiness.

11:24.400 --> 11:28.240
 There is, how much you think versus how much you feel, this comes up all the time.

11:28.240 --> 11:35.480
 In medicine, we encounter this all the time, when day after day you encounter the abyss

11:35.480 --> 11:41.720
 of suffering from patients, how much do you let yourself feel, or how much do you make

11:41.720 --> 11:46.840
 it abstract and objective and try to make it clinical.

11:46.840 --> 11:52.920
 That range, how you're able to move yourself on that spectrum is very important for survival

11:52.920 --> 11:55.320
 as a physician.

11:55.320 --> 12:00.400
 The way you protect yourself and your feelings turns out to be very important.

12:00.400 --> 12:04.840
 You quote Finnegan's Wake, Mad Props for that James Joyce book.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.720
 It's like a class on James Joyce in college.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.240
 I think I read parts of Finnegan Wake.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.640
 It might have been on drugs or some kind.

12:12.640 --> 12:18.520
 I somehow got an A in that class, which probably refers to some kind of curve where nobody

12:18.520 --> 12:19.520
 understood anything.

12:19.520 --> 12:23.520
 The only thing I understood and really enjoyed is his short stories, The Dead.

12:23.520 --> 12:29.560
 And then Ulysses, I think read a few Cliff Notes that got to the point, and then Finnegan's

12:29.560 --> 12:34.320
 Wake was just a hopeless person.

12:34.320 --> 12:39.840
 For people who haven't looked at it, maybe you can elucidate to me better, but I felt

12:39.840 --> 12:46.760
 like I was reading things, words, and the words made sense, like standing next to each

12:46.760 --> 12:47.920
 other.

12:47.920 --> 12:53.500
 But when you read for a while, you realize you didn't actually understand anything that

12:53.500 --> 12:54.500
 was said.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.500
 Right.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.500
 But did you have a feeling though?

12:56.500 --> 12:59.240
 That's one thing I found interesting about Finnegan's Wake.

12:59.240 --> 13:04.680
 I never fully understood it, but the words caused feelings in me, which I found fascinating.

13:04.680 --> 13:09.880
 And sometimes I couldn't predict it from the semantic black and white context of what I

13:09.880 --> 13:13.840
 was seeing in front of me on the page, but the rhythm or the melody would make me feel

13:13.840 --> 13:14.840
 certain ways.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.640
 And that was what I always was intrigued by with Joyce.

13:17.640 --> 13:23.360
 Of course, he existed on a spectrum too, and he wrote, as you say, more accessible

13:23.360 --> 13:24.360
 works.

13:24.360 --> 13:29.000
 I learned a lot about Irish history from a portrait of the artist as a young man, and

13:29.000 --> 13:33.240
 there was just, he could be as objective as he wanted to be, but then when he let himself

13:33.240 --> 13:42.360
 loose, he was in this realm where the words had their own purpose separate from semantic

13:42.360 --> 13:45.600
 meaning from their dry dictionary definition.

13:45.600 --> 13:50.920
 There's a funny story that I was told, doesn't matter if it's true or not, but they said

13:50.920 --> 13:56.320
 that James Joyce, when he was young, when he was in his teen years would go around sort

13:56.320 --> 14:00.040
 of Ireland drinking and so on and telling everybody that he's going to be one of, if

14:00.040 --> 14:07.040
 not the greatest writers of the 20th century, and he turned out to be that.

14:07.040 --> 14:12.680
 So I always think about that little story that somebody told me, because I have a lot

14:12.680 --> 14:18.600
 of people come up to me, including myself, I'm a bit of a dreamer, and you get into certain

14:18.600 --> 14:23.160
 moods where you say, I'm going to be the greatest anything ever.

14:23.160 --> 14:31.480
 You get people tell you this, especially young people, and it kind of, it makes me feel all

14:31.480 --> 14:38.040
 kinds of ways, but that story reminds me that you just might be one of the greatest writers

14:38.040 --> 14:44.040
 of the 21st century, for example, if somebody were to tell me that, and don't immediately

14:44.040 --> 14:49.400
 disregard that, because one of the people that say that, that's almost like a precondition,

14:49.400 --> 14:51.760
 that's a good requirement just to believe in yourself.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.640
 Maybe it's not a full requirement, but it's an interesting story.

14:55.640 --> 15:03.000
 Well, I think when someone tells you that, then it creates one season opportunity, and

15:03.000 --> 15:05.560
 then it would be a tragedy if the opportunity weren't captured, right?

15:05.560 --> 15:11.960
 And so then that creates some impetus, some motivation to do something good.

15:11.960 --> 15:17.800
 I think the mind, it's like, you know, I guess that's what like books like the books or whatever,

15:17.800 --> 15:22.960
 I don't even know if it's a book, the secret plugs into, they kind of make a whole industry

15:22.960 --> 15:28.240
 out of it, but there is something about the mind believing something, making it a reality.

15:28.240 --> 15:34.320
 It is just time and time again with Steve Jobs, like your belief in yourself, your belief

15:34.320 --> 15:41.960
 in an idea, sort of embracing the me versus the world, embracing the madness of this idea

15:41.960 --> 15:48.680
 and making it a life pursuit, somehow more reality for some tiny fraction of the population.

15:48.680 --> 15:57.960
 For everybody else, you descend into all the beautiful ways that failure materializes in

15:57.960 --> 15:59.960
 our lifetime.

15:59.960 --> 16:00.960
 You mentioned love earlier.

16:00.960 --> 16:05.800
 I mean, that's a great example of how belief in something makes it real, right?

16:05.800 --> 16:09.640
 It's not reasonable on the face of it, but because you believe it's reasonable, then

16:09.640 --> 16:13.160
 it actually does become reasonable, and then it is real, and so that's a good example.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.160
 That doesn't happen.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.000
 I'm also in a bioengineering department.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.640
 We don't imagine that a bridge is soundly built, and then it is soundly built.

16:19.640 --> 16:23.320
 That's something that, it doesn't come up in too many realms of human existence, but

16:23.320 --> 16:30.800
 love is one of them, and the ability to have a fixed idea and to say it's true, and then

16:30.800 --> 16:32.320
 it is true.

16:32.320 --> 16:36.640
 A bridge is a kind of manifestation of love, so maybe it does work a little bit, but it

16:36.640 --> 16:38.360
 can break down like Chernobyl did.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.160
 You can't just say it's safe.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.440
 You have to also prove it's safe.

16:43.440 --> 16:48.280
 But on Finnegan's Wake, I think, maybe correct me if I'm wrong, you're using kind of Finnegan's

16:48.280 --> 16:53.800
 Wake to give one perspective on what madness is, of what's going on in the mind.

16:53.800 --> 17:01.240
 How much of that is that we're simply unable to communicate with the person on the other

17:01.240 --> 17:04.040
 side of their mind?

17:04.040 --> 17:09.840
 There's almost like a little person inside the brain, and they have some circuitry that's

17:09.840 --> 17:14.600
 used to communicate emotion, communicate ideas to the outside world, and there's something

17:14.600 --> 17:18.040
 about that circuitry that makes it difficult to communicate with the little person on the

17:18.040 --> 17:19.040
 other side.

17:19.040 --> 17:25.240
 If you look at what shows up in schizophrenia, with many cases, what we call thought disorders,

17:25.240 --> 17:33.080
 what we call the individual speech symptoms of schizophrenia, Finnegan's Wake is loaded

17:33.080 --> 17:35.640
 with them, and it's just full of them.

17:35.640 --> 17:43.760
 We talk about clang associations in schizophrenia where the word that is said echoes in some

17:43.760 --> 17:47.800
 way the previous word, and we call that a clang association because there's no other reason

17:47.800 --> 17:55.640
 than the similarity of the sound, like a clang of a garage door being hit, and sometimes

17:55.640 --> 18:00.920
 it's not even a word, and we call that a neologism, a new word being created, and of course Finnegan's

18:00.920 --> 18:06.880
 Wake is full of that, and then we also, in schizophrenia, what we call loose associations

18:06.880 --> 18:11.880
 or tangential thought processes, of course full of that where things just go off in

18:11.880 --> 18:16.280
 directions that are not linear or logical.

18:16.280 --> 18:22.000
 You can't read Finnegan's Wake I think without, certainly as a psychiatrist you can't read

18:22.000 --> 18:27.400
 it without thinking about schizophrenia, and then when we look at the families of people

18:27.400 --> 18:32.520
 with schizophrenia, and Joyce was no exception, there very often are people within the family

18:32.520 --> 18:39.280
 who are on the spectrum, some have it, some are able to see it from a distance, from a

18:39.280 --> 18:45.320
 safe distance, there's an association between schizophrenia and what we call schizotypal

18:45.320 --> 18:50.440
 personality disorder where people are not quite in this severe state of schizophrenia

18:50.440 --> 18:55.200
 but have some magical thinking, have some unusual thought patterns, very often those

18:55.200 --> 18:57.760
 are family members of people with schizophrenia.

18:57.760 --> 19:06.040
 So this points again to this idea that there is a range even along this very severe, very

19:06.040 --> 19:11.480
 genetic biological illness that human beings dwell on different spots along that spectrum.

19:11.480 --> 19:16.760
 I should mention that we have my friend Sergei pulling up stuff, young Sergei or old Sergei,

19:16.760 --> 19:22.440
 I don't know what to call you, but there's drafts of Finnegan's Wake, yeah I actually

19:22.440 --> 19:27.640
 saw pictures of this from, I think it was on Instagram or something, these are early

19:27.640 --> 19:32.120
 drafts of Finnegan's Wake, and it's so beautiful to see, for people who are just listening,

19:32.120 --> 19:37.040
 there's just random paragraphs and writing all over the page with stuff crossed out

19:37.040 --> 19:44.280
 and it's great to see that Joyce himself was thinking in this kind of way as you're putting

19:44.280 --> 19:45.280
 it together.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.320
 How much do you think he was thinking about schizophrenia, the schizophrenic mind?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.320
 I think a lot.

19:49.320 --> 19:56.040
 I think it's known that his daughter suffered from schizophrenia and what's depicted here

19:56.040 --> 20:02.800
 on the page is something that I'm sure he either felt himself in some level was able

20:02.800 --> 20:09.720
 to access this nonlinearity of processing or had seen enough in family that he knew

20:09.720 --> 20:15.280
 what it was and was able to reflect it down in black and white on the paper.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.320
 What he was able to do was quite authentic in that sense.

20:19.320 --> 20:24.080
 Of course, I don't want to pigeonhole him, he was doing much more than that, it was much

20:24.080 --> 20:31.640
 more than talking about altered human thought processes and thought disorders, but that

20:31.640 --> 20:37.400
 was an aspect that he was so good at representing that it had to be intentional to some extent.

20:37.400 --> 20:42.640
 A tiny tangent, what does your own writing look like for this book because it's extremely

20:42.640 --> 20:44.360
 well written?

20:44.360 --> 20:51.560
 How many edits did you just drink some whiskey and like I'm imagining Hemingway style, what's

20:51.560 --> 20:55.760
 a very different, the writing is very different, I mean, it's really, really well written,

20:55.760 --> 21:02.160
 which was like, I was reading it, it makes you realize, because I was expecting sort

21:02.160 --> 21:09.160
 of a science kind of, which it is like, you know, elucidating something about the human

21:09.160 --> 21:15.920
 mind kind of thing, but you could also probably write really strong like novels.

21:15.920 --> 21:19.680
 So maybe that's in the future, but anyway, what is your, how many edits, how many, what's

21:19.680 --> 21:20.680
 your style?

21:20.680 --> 21:21.680
 Does it look like that?

21:21.680 --> 21:22.680
 Is it more structured, organized?

21:22.680 --> 21:26.560
 Unfortunately, I used a laptop, so I didn't have this sort of a beautiful record of it.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.520
 No typewriter, cigarette and whiskey.

21:29.520 --> 21:34.400
 I did explore, which was their particular altered state that would help me to be most

21:34.400 --> 21:42.600
 creative and I found actually, I actually did the best while sober, but slightly disinhibited

21:42.600 --> 21:49.480
 in the late hours of the night or early morning, particularly late hours of the night there.

21:49.480 --> 21:54.840
 And I have a friend who would tell me that she thought that very early in the morning,

21:54.840 --> 22:00.120
 her inner critic was still asleep and she could write more effectively before her inner

22:00.120 --> 22:01.120
 critic woke up.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.120
 Yeah.

22:02.120 --> 22:06.240
 And I actually found that outstanding advice for me that I often found that there was, I

22:06.240 --> 22:09.480
 was looser and could write more in the morning.

22:09.480 --> 22:15.520
 But the other interesting thing is each chapter, each story, it's about a different human being

22:15.520 --> 22:21.880
 with a different class of psychiatric disorder, that's what each story, each chapter is anchored

22:21.880 --> 22:22.880
 in.

22:22.880 --> 22:31.960
 But I'm trying to use words and style of writing and, you know, diction that captures the feeling

22:31.960 --> 22:32.960
 of the disorder.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.920
 And so it's different in each story.

22:34.920 --> 22:42.320
 In the story about mania, which is a very expansive, exuberant, at least briefly uplifting

22:42.320 --> 22:48.520
 state where the words come out in a torrent and they're complex and pressured and elaborate,

22:48.520 --> 22:52.560
 I try to capture that feeling with the words used in that chapter.

22:52.560 --> 22:57.960
 And then in the schizophrenia or psychosis chapter where things slowly fragment over

22:57.960 --> 23:03.920
 time and become looser and separated, I try to capture that in the writing too.

23:03.920 --> 23:08.360
 So for each, it wasn't as if there was a single mode I could be in for the whole book.

23:08.360 --> 23:13.520
 For each chapter, I had to put myself into a different mode to capture that inner feeling

23:13.520 --> 23:14.520
 of the disorder.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.040
 When you put yourself in that mode, does that change you?

23:17.040 --> 23:18.040
 Yeah.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.840
 I couldn't turn it on and off right away.

23:19.840 --> 23:24.680
 I had to, first, I would start by thinking about the person or the people, one or two

23:24.680 --> 23:30.840
 people based on real patients and the stories that are put forth, the symptom descriptions

23:30.840 --> 23:31.840
 are real.

23:31.840 --> 23:32.840
 They're from the patients.

23:32.840 --> 23:37.080
 Of course, all details change to protect privacy, but the actual symptom descriptions

23:37.080 --> 23:38.080
 are real.

23:38.080 --> 23:44.400
 And I would sit with them and really try to inhabit the space of the mind of that person

23:44.400 --> 23:45.880
 that I knew.

23:45.880 --> 23:48.720
 And that's not instantaneous, it would take some time.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.720
 I needed quiet.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.720
 I needed to be still.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.360
 That's another reason late at night is good.

23:53.360 --> 23:58.960
 Sergei posted that draws in his gifts, creativity boosts according to Andrew Huberman.

23:58.960 --> 23:59.960
 Thank you, Andrew.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.960
 He's not wrong.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.240
 He's not wrong.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.880
 Why projections?

24:04.880 --> 24:11.960
 Is it, I mean, instead of putting words into your mouth, because I can imagine a lot.

24:11.960 --> 24:18.280
 To me, I will start putting words in your mouth, despite what I just said.

24:18.280 --> 24:23.280
 So to me, projections, working on neural networks, for example, from an artificial neural networks

24:23.280 --> 24:27.640
 from a machine learning perspective, it's often, that's exactly what you're doing.

24:27.640 --> 24:32.920
 You're having an incredibly complex thing and you're trying to find simple representations

24:32.920 --> 24:34.480
 in order for you to make sense of it.

24:34.480 --> 24:41.680
 So I was kind of thinking about in that way, which is like this incredibly complex neural

24:41.680 --> 24:49.080
 neural network that is kind of projecting itself onto the world through this low bandwidth

24:49.080 --> 24:52.520
 expression of emotion and speech and all that kind of stuff.

24:52.520 --> 24:58.080
 And the way it's, we only have that window into your soul, the eyes and the speech and

24:58.080 --> 24:59.080
 so on.

24:59.080 --> 25:07.000
 So in that way, when there's any kind of disorder, we get to only see that disorder through that

25:07.000 --> 25:11.120
 narrow window as opposed to the full complexity of its origins.

25:11.120 --> 25:16.520
 The word projections definitely serves that purpose here, but it's got a few other really

25:16.520 --> 25:19.440
 appropriate, other connotations as well.

25:19.440 --> 25:24.720
 So the first thing is a projection in terms of neuroscience is this long range connection

25:24.720 --> 25:26.960
 that goes from one part of the brain to another.

25:26.960 --> 25:30.680
 And so it's what binds two parts of our brain together.

25:30.680 --> 25:34.000
 There are projections, long range connections of axons.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.200
 These are the outgoing threads that connect one part of the brain to another part.

25:40.200 --> 25:45.120
 There's a projection that links, for example, auditory cortex where we hear things to reward

25:45.120 --> 25:50.360
 centers where we can feel, where feelings of pleasure and reward are initiated.

25:50.360 --> 25:55.000
 And it's been shown that if you have reduced connectivity along that dimension, you are

25:55.000 --> 25:56.680
 less able to enjoy music.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.760
 And so these connections, these projections matter.

25:58.760 --> 26:04.080
 They define how effectively two parts of the brain can engage with each other and join

26:04.080 --> 26:07.800
 together to form a joint representation of something.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.800
 So that's one meaning.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
 It's pure neuroscience.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.760
 The word projection is used all the time, and it happens to be something that optogenetics,

26:13.760 --> 26:17.200
 a technique that maybe we'll talk about a little later, works particularly well with.

26:17.200 --> 26:21.920
 We can use light to turn on or off the activity along these projections from one spot of the

26:21.920 --> 26:22.920
 brain to another.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.560
 And this is particularly referring to the long range connections?

26:25.560 --> 26:29.000
 Yeah, it's particularly straightforward along these long range projections that connect

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
 different parts of the brain.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.120
 But it works over a shorter range, too.

26:32.120 --> 26:35.400
 But then there's this other meaning of projections, which you were bringing up, which is very

26:35.400 --> 26:40.520
 relevant, which is at some point you can reduce something from one level of dimensionality

26:40.520 --> 26:45.240
 to another, and you can project down into a lower dimensional space, for example.

26:45.240 --> 26:50.280
 And then finally, there's a psychiatric term projections, which comes up all the time,

26:50.280 --> 26:59.000
 which is we very often will look at our internal states and to understand somebody else, we'll

26:59.000 --> 27:03.320
 project them onto somebody else, we'll try to understand someone else's behavior and

27:03.320 --> 27:10.840
 make sense of it by projecting our own inner feelings, our own sort of narrative onto them

27:10.840 --> 27:15.160
 and use that as a way to help us understand them better.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.160
 And we'll do the reverse, too.

27:16.160 --> 27:19.840
 We'll take things we see in the outside world and we'll bring them into ourselves and see

27:19.840 --> 27:21.600
 how well they map, how well they align.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.320
 That's called introjection.

27:23.320 --> 27:25.920
 So projections turns out to be a really rich word.

27:25.920 --> 27:31.880
 And finally, of course, there's the very common sense of it as a projector that illuminates

27:31.880 --> 27:36.040
 by conveying information across space with light.

27:36.040 --> 27:40.720
 So for English, for English language, perfect word to use for this book, but what's funny

27:40.720 --> 27:46.680
 is not every, there are a lot of international translations now, and all those rich connotations

27:46.680 --> 27:48.720
 aren't captured in other languages.

27:48.720 --> 27:54.160
 And so for some translations, connections is used instead of projections.

27:54.160 --> 27:58.520
 In fact, even in England, the British version is connections instead of projections because

27:58.520 --> 28:02.640
 apparently, projections doesn't have the full connotation I was told there.

28:02.640 --> 28:08.960
 So you have to sacrifice some of the rich ambiguity of meaning with connections.

28:08.960 --> 28:09.960
 That's interesting.

28:09.960 --> 28:13.960
 I mean, words are so interesting, they have so many meanings.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.960
 I love language and how much is lost in translation.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.760
 I'm very fortunate enough to be able to speak, I'm not good at languages.

28:20.760 --> 28:27.800
 I was just, I guess, forced to, by less circumstance, to learn two languages, Russian and English.

28:27.800 --> 28:31.640
 And it's just so interesting to watch how much of culture, how much of people, how much

28:31.640 --> 28:35.320
 of history is lost in translation.

28:35.320 --> 28:41.960
 The poetry, the music, the history, the pain, the way the scientists actually express themselves,

28:41.960 --> 28:42.960
 which is funny.

28:42.960 --> 28:53.440
 I mean, just, it's so sad to see how much brilliant work that was written in Russian.

28:53.440 --> 28:57.960
 There's a whole culture of science in the Soviet Union that is not lost.

28:57.960 --> 29:05.200
 It makes me wonder in the modern day, how much incredible science is going on in China

29:05.200 --> 29:07.000
 that is lost in translation.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.840
 And I'll never, I mean, that makes me very sad because I'll never learn Chinese in the

29:12.840 --> 29:16.040
 same way that I've learned English and Russian.

29:16.040 --> 29:20.440
 Maybe whenever I say stuff like that, people are like, well, there's still time.

29:20.440 --> 29:23.960
 You know, yeah, that's actually fair.

29:23.960 --> 29:31.080
 That I think the 21st century, both China and US will have very important roles in the

29:31.080 --> 29:37.000
 scientific development, and we should actually bridge the gap through language.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.840
 And that doesn't just mean convincing Chinese to speak English.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.920
 That means also learning Chinese.

29:42.920 --> 29:49.440
 Well, we need these bridge people who can do both, you know, Nabokov, for example, writing

29:49.440 --> 29:54.920
 in English beautifully, you know, one of my favorite poets, Borges, who, you know, mentioned

29:54.920 --> 30:00.840
 earlier, he wrote both in English and in Spanish, I think, you know, beautifully in both.

30:00.840 --> 30:07.400
 We need those people who can serve as bridges across cultures who really can do both.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.560
 You mentioned Borges.

30:08.560 --> 30:15.840
 So you opened your book with a few lines from a poem by Jorge Luiz Borges, a love poem.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.520
 I'm going to read parts of it because it's a damn good poem.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.520
 Yeah.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.520
 It's called Two English Poems.

30:20.520 --> 30:26.320
 I mean, there's, I'd like to understand why you used it and the specific parts you used,

30:26.320 --> 30:27.320
 which is interesting.

30:27.320 --> 30:36.280
 But then when I read the full thing, so I think you used it as a sort of beautiful description

30:36.280 --> 30:42.400
 of what it means to delve deep into understanding, offering yourself to the task of understanding

30:42.400 --> 30:44.040
 another human being.

30:44.040 --> 30:47.520
 But if you look at the full context of the poem, it's also a damn good description of

30:47.520 --> 30:56.040
 being hit by love and overtaken by it and sort of trying to figure out how to make sense

30:56.040 --> 30:59.440
 of the world now that you've been stricken by it.

30:59.440 --> 31:05.520
 It says a bunch of things about chatting and significantly with friends and all those kinds

31:05.520 --> 31:06.520
 of things.

31:06.520 --> 31:11.040
 And then the poem reads, the big wave brought you.

31:11.040 --> 31:16.920
 This is the moment, I guess, of the universe where the two people you fall in love.

31:16.920 --> 31:18.720
 Maybe I'm totally misreading this poem, by the way.

31:18.720 --> 31:19.720
 It doesn't matter.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.520
 You can't misread the poem.

31:22.520 --> 31:29.040
 So it goes on, words, any words, your laughter, and you so lazily and incessantly beautiful,

31:29.040 --> 31:31.960
 we talked and you have forgotten the words.

31:31.960 --> 31:37.840
 The shattering dawn finds me in a deserted street of my city, your profile turned away,

31:37.840 --> 31:42.400
 the sounds that go to make your name, the lilt of your laughter.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.360
 These are the illustrious toys you have left me.

31:45.360 --> 31:49.360
 So these little memories of these peculiar little details, he remembers, those are the

31:49.360 --> 31:50.360
 illustrious toys.

31:50.360 --> 31:55.600
 I apologize to mix my own words with the poem, but you should definitely read it.

31:55.600 --> 32:01.040
 I turn them over in the dawn, I lose them, I find them, I tell them to the few stray

32:01.040 --> 32:05.560
 dogs and to the few stray stars of the dawn.

32:05.560 --> 32:11.560
 Your dark, rich life, I must get at you somehow.

32:11.560 --> 32:14.400
 I put away those illustrious toys you have left me.

32:14.400 --> 32:21.040
 I want your hidden look, your real smile, that lonely mocking smile your cool mirror

32:21.040 --> 32:22.040
 knows.

32:22.040 --> 32:26.120
 I want your hidden look, your real smile.

32:26.120 --> 32:30.640
 So this is the first part of the poem, and then it goes on, which is some of the parts

32:30.640 --> 32:33.360
 that you reference.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.920
 Second part is, what can I hold you with?

32:35.920 --> 32:40.240
 I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets, the moon or the jagged suburbs.

32:40.240 --> 32:45.120
 I offer you the bitterness of a man who has looked long and long at a lonely moon.

32:45.120 --> 32:51.400
 I offer you my ancestors, my dead men, the ghosts that living men have honored in bronze.

32:51.400 --> 32:56.480
 My father's father killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires, two bullets through his lungs

32:56.480 --> 32:57.760
 and so on and so on.

32:57.760 --> 33:02.520
 I offer you whatever insights my books may hold, whatever manliness of humor my life.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.720
 I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal.

33:05.720 --> 33:10.440
 I offer you that kernel of myself that have saved somehow the central heart that deals

33:10.440 --> 33:18.680
 not in words, traffics, not with dreams and is untouched by time, my joy and adversities.

33:18.680 --> 33:22.040
 And I think this is where the part they include in the book.

33:22.040 --> 33:27.680
 I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen as sunset, years before you were born.

33:27.680 --> 33:33.040
 Damn, that's a good line, okay.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.600
 I offer you explanations of yourself.

33:35.600 --> 33:39.080
 Stories about yourself, authentic and surprising news of yourself.

33:39.080 --> 33:43.520
 I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the hunger of my heart.

33:43.520 --> 33:47.880
 I'm trying to bribe you with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat.

33:47.880 --> 33:53.440
 That is a man who's in love and longing, but I just want to go back to, maybe you could

33:53.440 --> 33:59.200
 say why you wanted to include that poem, but also your dark rich life, I must get at you

33:59.200 --> 34:00.200
 somehow.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.400
 I put away those illustrious toys you have left me at.

34:03.400 --> 34:08.240
 I want your hidden look, your real smile, that lonely mocking smile, your cool mirror

34:08.240 --> 34:09.240
 nose.

34:09.240 --> 34:15.240
 Well, sometimes I meet a stranger and I just, it's like a double take.

34:15.240 --> 34:17.920
 It's like, who are you?

34:17.920 --> 34:19.640
 Have we met before somewhere?

34:19.640 --> 34:22.400
 Who's that person behind there?

34:22.400 --> 34:24.840
 And I want to get at that, whatever that is.

34:24.840 --> 34:30.800
 And of course, maybe that's what love is because maybe that's the whole pursuit, like a lifelong

34:30.800 --> 34:32.520
 pursuit of getting at that person.

34:32.520 --> 34:38.080
 Maybe that's what that is and like that insatiable sort of curiosity to keep getting to it.

34:38.080 --> 34:40.440
 Like, well, who's that person in your private life?

34:40.440 --> 34:41.440
 Yeah.

34:41.440 --> 34:44.760
 So that, absolutely, I think that it was a beautiful description of what you just said

34:44.760 --> 34:48.880
 when there's that first moment and then you want to dive deeper.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.200
 You want to know what the hidden mysteries are.

34:52.200 --> 34:55.320
 In a way, it's a love poem.

34:55.320 --> 35:01.920
 As a scientist though, it's also, it's a bit of how a scientist can love science.

35:01.920 --> 35:10.400
 And that wanting to dive deeper is, it's almost like, again, where the, it could be a love

35:10.400 --> 35:13.560
 affair with investigating the human mind, for example.

35:13.560 --> 35:19.240
 And that was one reason it spoke to me also, again, thinking about the broader sweep of

35:19.240 --> 35:25.200
 where the human mind came from, the steps it took to get where it is today, what was

35:25.200 --> 35:28.240
 given up along the way, what compromises were made.

35:28.240 --> 35:31.560
 And here's where the darkness of the poem starts to come in a little bit too.

35:31.560 --> 35:39.200
 It doesn't shy away from the negativity, from the confusion, from the danger.

35:39.200 --> 35:46.760
 And then at the very end, the Board of Haces is offering up scenes from his life, parts

35:46.760 --> 35:48.280
 of himself.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.600
 And this is how we connect with people.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.040
 We offer up parts of ourselves.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.040
 Just here it is.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.760
 And then we see how well does that map onto what you have.

35:54.760 --> 36:00.440
 And it's that offering up that I liked and not the good stuff or not only the good stuff.

36:00.440 --> 36:03.800
 The yellow rose is nice, but he's offering up the bad stuff too.

36:03.800 --> 36:10.160
 And that to me was important for the book because I'm offering up hard stuff too, in

36:10.160 --> 36:11.320
 fact, a lot of it.

36:11.320 --> 36:15.160
 And also, hard stuff from within me, from my own personal side too.

36:15.160 --> 36:19.640
 And that was, there's a lot of vulnerability that comes with that, but that's, that comes

36:19.640 --> 36:23.840
 with love, that comes with writing, you have to be open, you have to be vulnerable.

36:23.840 --> 36:29.760
 And so, I thought that reflected what I was trying to do and I thought it was as an epigraphic

36:29.760 --> 36:37.440
 kind of made it clear how vulnerable I was in taking the step, but also what could come

36:37.440 --> 36:38.440
 out of it.

36:38.440 --> 36:46.360
 And also, in a meta way, because I was not familiar with this poem, it may be curious

36:46.360 --> 36:51.320
 of the poem itself to pull at that thread of finding out more.

36:51.320 --> 36:58.880
 You picked a very particular part that kind of means you want to pull at that thread and

36:58.880 --> 37:03.040
 see where did this, where did these few lines come from?

37:03.040 --> 37:08.600
 Because I read it as a curiosity of a scientist, those lines alone.

37:08.600 --> 37:17.240
 And also, as a desperate human being, searching, like offering himself for an understanding

37:17.240 --> 37:19.520
 or connection with another human being.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.880
 And then, because I wasn't sure if it's a love poem or not, or if it's desperation

37:22.880 --> 37:25.920
 or if it's curiosity, whatever it is, and then you see the love poem.

37:25.920 --> 37:32.280
 I mean, I don't know, that's going to stick with me for a while, your dark, rich life.

37:32.280 --> 37:37.920
 And then a few lines in here are just, I mean, those are, I'm going to just use them

37:37.920 --> 37:43.520
 as pick up lines at a bar, I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset years

37:43.520 --> 37:45.520
 before you were born.

37:45.520 --> 37:50.600
 Now, that's a pick up line if I've ever heard one.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.600
 Anyway, sorry.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.600
 But this is universal.

37:52.600 --> 37:59.240
 You see it in so many forms of art, like we're in Texas now, you see this in country, country

37:59.240 --> 38:03.720
 and western songs, it's often a list of things, like here's how I describe myself, there's

38:03.720 --> 38:06.400
 this and there's that, and there's the other thing, and here you are.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.800
 These things matter to me, and I hope they matter to you too.

38:09.800 --> 38:17.280
 It's a pretty universal form, but he did it in this very artful and very vulnerable way.

38:17.280 --> 38:22.400
 It was both beautiful and you could feel the hurt coming from him too, and that was important.

38:22.400 --> 38:28.320
 And the dark stuff too, I offer you my ancestors, my dead men, the ghosts that living men have

38:28.320 --> 38:34.360
 honored in bronze and talking about two bullets through his lungs, bearded and dead, wrapped

38:34.360 --> 38:41.680
 by his soldiers in the height of a cow, my mother's grandfather just 24, heading a charge

38:41.680 --> 38:47.080
 of 300 men in Peru, now ghosts on vanished horses.

38:47.080 --> 38:50.600
 So all of it, the whole history of it.

38:50.600 --> 38:56.480
 Because it is a love poem, what do you think about love, Carl?

38:56.480 --> 38:58.720
 What's the role of love in the human condition?

38:58.720 --> 39:02.800
 We'll talk about the dark stuff, but maybe love is the dark stuff too.

39:02.800 --> 39:10.920
 I mean, it's the most powerful connection we can form, and that's what makes it so important

39:10.920 --> 39:11.920
 to us.

39:11.920 --> 39:17.840
 It's the strongest and most stable connection that we can form with another person, and

39:17.840 --> 39:25.640
 that matters immensely, it matters for the human family to have evolved to be something

39:25.640 --> 39:33.960
 that could survive against the odds that we've faced over the years, that unreasonable bond

39:33.960 --> 39:39.040
 that becomes reasonable by virtue of its own existence.

39:39.040 --> 39:46.800
 And of course, that joy, the wild, raw joy of love is not a bad thing either.

39:46.800 --> 39:52.840
 But you put these together, the strongest bridge we can form, and the reward and the

39:52.840 --> 39:57.080
 joy that it brings, that's what love is to me.

39:57.080 --> 40:05.240
 And from my perspective, this is something that, it can be hard to capture fairly because

40:05.240 --> 40:09.160
 you want to talk about the positive and the negative sides at once.

40:09.160 --> 40:14.040
 They need to be wrapped up together for a full, honest description of what it is.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.760
 And that's hard to do in a compact form.

40:16.760 --> 40:22.920
 And so, you have to take time to talk about love, you have to take time to do it justice.

40:22.920 --> 40:28.160
 It takes a book or at least a poem or several thousands of them.

40:28.160 --> 40:34.080
 I don't know, could you pull up, there's a video I saw, yeah, like right here.

40:34.080 --> 40:37.800
 So can you pause for a second?

40:37.800 --> 40:39.320
 So there's March of the Penguins.

40:39.320 --> 40:45.800
 So you always see like penguins huddling together against, I mean, sorry if I see just metaphors

40:45.800 --> 40:52.000
 and everything, but them huddling together against the harshness of the conditions around

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
 them.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.640
 That's very kind of, that's like a metaphor for life, like finding this connection.

40:57.640 --> 41:02.280
 That's kind of what love is, it's like it allows you to forget whatever the absurdity,

41:02.280 --> 41:06.840
 whatever the suffering of life is together, you get to like huddle for warmth.

41:06.840 --> 41:13.080
 And that's why I love the sort of just the honesty and the intensity of the way penguins

41:13.080 --> 41:15.440
 just in the middle of like the cold do this.

41:15.440 --> 41:21.000
 And then this video I saw a lonely, this is misinformation.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.800
 So the name of the video is Lonely Deranged Penguin.

41:23.800 --> 41:26.120
 I don't know if he's deranged.

41:26.120 --> 41:35.000
 So if you play it, so he left his pack and there's a nice like voiceover and you don't

41:35.000 --> 41:41.920
 need to play it, but he for some reason left the pack and journeyed out into the mountains.

41:41.920 --> 41:46.560
 And so the narrator says that he's deranged, he's lost his mind.

41:46.560 --> 41:52.160
 Now I'd like to project the idea that he's actually, there's so many stories you could

41:52.160 --> 41:53.160
 think of.

41:53.160 --> 41:55.320
 He's returning to his homeland.

41:55.320 --> 42:00.040
 He's an outsider thinking, journey out into the unknown thinking he may be able to discover

42:00.040 --> 42:01.760
 something greater than the tribe.

42:01.760 --> 42:04.720
 He might be looking for lost love.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.760
 Why is he deranged immediately?

42:06.760 --> 42:08.880
 Why is he lost his mind anyway?

42:08.880 --> 42:14.520
 But people should look up this video because to me, I might be the only one who romanticizes

42:14.520 --> 42:21.920
 this, but it's such a nice kind of, it's both a picture of perhaps a mental disorder, which

42:21.920 --> 42:24.040
 is what the video kind of describes.

42:24.040 --> 42:30.640
 And it may be some deeper explanation that's not, that has to do with the motivation of

42:30.640 --> 42:31.640
 a mind.

42:31.640 --> 42:36.400
 Yeah, I don't know if, I don't know if you have a deeper analysis on this, Penguin.

42:36.400 --> 42:42.880
 Well, I, like you, psychiatrist, I would, I would want to sit down with a penguin and

42:42.880 --> 42:47.800
 go through, I want to see the notes from his prior therapist.

42:47.800 --> 42:51.760
 But this, this actually is relevant.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.680
 Not knowing what was that penguins motivation.

42:54.680 --> 43:00.000
 We have very clear situations where there are both within an individual, we go through

43:00.000 --> 43:06.680
 periods of time when we stay in one place and we reap the benefits from what we've built.

43:06.680 --> 43:13.600
 And then we go through periods of foraging, of wandering, even if there may be resources

43:13.600 --> 43:15.520
 where we are.

43:15.520 --> 43:22.760
 We have periods of time in our lives where we wander, where we go in an exploratory mode.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.720
 And different people express that trait in different ways.

43:25.720 --> 43:31.760
 This is not a human specific trait, if you go down to, to the tiny little nematode worm,

43:31.760 --> 43:36.800
 sea elegans with 302 nervous system cells, they go through these phases of foraging and

43:36.800 --> 43:41.560
 rest and different individuals have different propensity to forage or, or to rest and stay

43:41.560 --> 43:43.000
 in one place.

43:43.000 --> 43:50.080
 At the level of the species, that's really good that there's that diversity in their

43:50.080 --> 43:51.280
 willingness to forge.

43:51.280 --> 43:56.760
 Some stay where they are, the species is somewhat on a firm footing then.

43:56.760 --> 44:02.720
 But some carry a burden, a risk for themselves, but it's good for the species that they're

44:02.720 --> 44:05.520
 explorers and they will venture out.

44:05.520 --> 44:10.280
 The migration patterns that different species blunder into and that turn out to be really

44:10.280 --> 44:11.280
 good.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.360
 They weren't logically derived.

44:13.360 --> 44:17.880
 They most certainly started from something like this, an exploration.

44:17.880 --> 44:19.400
 If humans do this too, you think?

44:19.400 --> 44:20.560
 And we do it too.

44:20.560 --> 44:23.960
 In fact, it's something we do extremely well.

44:23.960 --> 44:28.960
 Let's talk about psychiatry a little bit.

44:28.960 --> 44:31.080
 So in my book, you're a rock star.

44:31.080 --> 44:37.440
 First of all, for people who don't know, you're one, aside from sort of the neurological

44:37.440 --> 44:42.000
 view of the brain and neuroscience view of the brain, you're also one of the great psychiatrists

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
 of our time.

44:43.000 --> 44:50.000
 I've always, not always, but when I was younger, I dreamed about being a psychiatrist.

44:50.000 --> 45:00.240
 So it's like getting to meet your heroes and also getting to meet the people who the best

45:00.240 --> 45:04.320
 at the top of the world at the thing you've failed to pursue.

45:04.320 --> 45:07.600
 So I'm getting a free therapy session on top of that.

45:07.600 --> 45:13.960
 So what big picture, what is the practice to go the hope of modern psychiatry?

45:13.960 --> 45:20.960
 If you could try to describe the discipline as you see it, maybe historically throughout

45:20.960 --> 45:27.360
 the 20th century in contrasting to what it is today, or maybe if you want to describe

45:27.360 --> 45:34.280
 to what you hope psychiatry becomes or longs to become in the 21st century.

45:34.280 --> 45:36.800
 It's been an interesting journey.

45:36.800 --> 45:41.120
 Psychiatry started out pretty firmly grounded in neurology and pathology.

45:41.120 --> 45:47.320
 Only initial founders effectively of the field were very well grounded in microscopy, looking

45:47.320 --> 45:53.000
 at cells, working with patients, particularly on the neurological side, and this certainly

45:53.000 --> 45:58.440
 included Freud and some of his contemporaries.

45:58.440 --> 46:05.040
 But they rapidly discovered that what they could work with at the level of cells and

46:05.040 --> 46:11.880
 microscopy was so far from the realm of what they could get from a human being and what

46:11.880 --> 46:16.320
 they were getting from the human being was so much more interesting and had so mysterious

46:16.320 --> 46:20.440
 and so unknown that many of them just said, we're going to inhabit this domain and we're

46:20.440 --> 46:25.680
 going to work with the people, with their words and understand what we can based on

46:25.680 --> 46:30.920
 verbal communication because that was the only tool that people really had.

46:30.920 --> 46:37.160
 And that was a very important step for the field.

46:37.160 --> 46:42.520
 I would say one of the interesting things that came from the early decades of psychiatry

46:42.520 --> 46:48.720
 really was this distinction between the conscious and the unconscious mind and paying particular

46:48.720 --> 46:55.040
 attention to the unconscious mind as something that was worthy of consideration that might

46:55.040 --> 47:00.520
 be important in explaining people's actions and that perhaps even insight into that was

47:00.520 --> 47:02.960
 valuable in its own right.

47:02.960 --> 47:12.760
 And out of that psychoanalysis became a practice that was not always focused on cures or treatment

47:12.760 --> 47:14.320
 but was more focused on insight.

47:14.320 --> 47:15.320
 What does it mean?

47:15.320 --> 47:20.240
 How can we help people understand why they're feeling something or thinking something or

47:20.240 --> 47:22.400
 dreaming something?

47:22.400 --> 47:28.080
 And that insight separate even from treatment was an interesting thing as long as one was

47:28.080 --> 47:32.600
 honest about that and said, we're going for understanding, we're going for insight.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.880
 Maybe it's useful to just pause on that.

47:34.880 --> 47:42.320
 If you look at the father of psychoanalysis, Zygmunt Freud, what do you make of the ideas

47:42.320 --> 47:43.440
 that he had?

47:43.440 --> 47:49.520
 So you mentioned taking the unconscious, the subconscious seriously.

47:49.520 --> 47:53.760
 That's like step one, like that there could be worlds we do not have direct access for

47:53.760 --> 48:01.880
 and we probe at them through conversation or is that too simplistic to call psychoanalysis

48:01.880 --> 48:02.880
 conversation?

48:02.880 --> 48:04.760
 That's not too simplistic.

48:04.760 --> 48:05.760
 But that's right.

48:05.760 --> 48:10.400
 And I think that was valuable where Freud ended up breaking from some of his contemporaries.

48:10.400 --> 48:16.360
 He was very focused on this unconscious as being so tightly linked to libido.

48:16.360 --> 48:21.440
 And really, from his perspective, you couldn't really separate the operation of the unconscious

48:21.440 --> 48:29.320
 mind from these aspects, the libidinous aspects and that was one reason, sexual related drives.

48:29.320 --> 48:37.360
 Carl Jung, who was contemporary, that's one factor that led to them separating was Carl

48:37.360 --> 48:42.800
 Jung felt there was a lot more to the unconscious than this libidinous aspect of it.

48:42.800 --> 48:51.040
 And he saw it as a much more complete alternate representation of the conscious self, one

48:51.040 --> 49:03.240
 that maybe reflected a whole range of different motivations and desires and to properly treat

49:03.240 --> 49:06.600
 it when had to consider all of them rather than the ones that that Freud was hooked on.

49:06.600 --> 49:14.720
 Yes, Carl Jung, thank you for the high level of images that Sergei is pulling up for people

49:14.720 --> 49:15.720
 who are just listening.

49:15.720 --> 49:23.480
 He pulled up as a quote from Sigmund Freud's meme, your mom quote, Freud.

49:23.480 --> 49:30.080
 So the shadow, the Carl Jung shadow encompasses everything, not just the desire to have sex

49:30.080 --> 49:34.400
 with your mother or sex period.

49:34.400 --> 49:40.760
 If you look at those two folks en masse, I mean, there's a kind of, it's almost like

49:40.760 --> 49:46.720
 a technique for philosophical exploration of human mind, human motivations.

49:46.720 --> 49:53.880
 So it's not even necessarily, it's also doubles as a methodology for helping people, but it's

49:53.880 --> 49:59.520
 almost like a, it's a kind of philosophical method.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.160
 Right.

50:01.160 --> 50:07.320
 This is the fascinating thing about psychoanalysis and even though it's, I would say, mostly

50:07.320 --> 50:11.880
 not considered a treatment today, it persists for a couple of reasons.

50:11.880 --> 50:15.960
 One is, it's thought that it gives people some insight.

50:15.960 --> 50:22.360
 But second, there's been a huge influence on literature, on philosophy, on art.

50:22.360 --> 50:30.160
 And the opening up of discussion about what was below our conscious mind was so fertile

50:30.160 --> 50:35.820
 in the implications that it sort of reverberated and still does throughout all these different

50:35.820 --> 50:45.560
 realms of human endeavor from different artistic experiences that people have can be colored

50:45.560 --> 50:50.040
 by this concept of the unconscious.

50:50.040 --> 50:57.000
 Now the other thing that was interesting is this distinction, what are the parts of the

50:57.000 --> 50:58.080
 unconscious?

50:58.080 --> 51:08.120
 And so there were these id and ego and superego subdivisions that Freud, for example, would

51:08.120 --> 51:09.440
 talk about them.

51:09.440 --> 51:15.880
 And the id was the primary, the primal drives that an infant would have or that a very young

51:15.880 --> 51:22.600
 child just warmth and feeding and then later the sexual or libidinous aspects.

51:22.600 --> 51:27.040
 And for Freud, the later happened very quickly.

51:27.040 --> 51:31.520
 Just the controversial thing about him, I think, I guess he thought even children had

51:31.520 --> 51:34.800
 sexual desires that they're dealing with, contending with.

51:34.800 --> 51:40.280
 So it's the full thing, hungry, wanting to eat, wanting to poop, wanting to have sex.

51:40.280 --> 51:43.800
 And he was extremely focused on that aspect.

51:43.800 --> 51:51.680
 But then there was the superego which brought on these later sort of moralistic sort of codes

51:51.680 --> 51:53.400
 of conduct.

51:53.400 --> 51:58.680
 And that, of course, was very often intention, but all this could play out subconsciously.

51:58.680 --> 52:04.600
 And then the ego, this third aspect was mediating and Freud's conception mediated this tension

52:04.600 --> 52:07.400
 between the different parts.

52:07.400 --> 52:09.040
 Now I think that's interesting.

52:09.040 --> 52:17.080
 I will say that in some ways it's maybe unnecessary from the perspective of modern neuroscience

52:17.080 --> 52:28.160
 to divide things up that way from the moralistic drives and the primal gratification drives.

52:28.160 --> 52:32.880
 In some ways they're all drives and maybe they're even all primal drives.

52:32.880 --> 52:38.040
 The moralistic drives they're taught and they're taught in ways that ultimately relate back

52:38.040 --> 52:47.360
 to survival and you could even say selfish aspects of health and life for the self and

52:47.360 --> 52:48.360
 family.

52:48.360 --> 52:53.480
 And so this is, I think it's maybe an artificial distinction.

52:53.480 --> 52:57.760
 The concept of the unconscious is very valuable and very interesting.

52:57.760 --> 53:06.480
 But these categorizations of id and superego may not map onto neurobiology in any particular

53:06.480 --> 53:07.480
 way.

53:07.480 --> 53:13.720
 If there's a town hall of competing drives and desires and they interrelate to each other,

53:13.720 --> 53:19.040
 they involve different aspects of the brain and the history of the person.

53:19.040 --> 53:25.200
 And actions and choices come out of the result of that overall shouting in the town hall.

53:25.200 --> 53:29.120
 So in some sense Carl Jung was a step into the direction of liberating yourself from

53:29.120 --> 53:31.120
 such harsh categorizations.

53:31.120 --> 53:38.480
 I mean, you have Daniel Kahneman with system one and system two, there's just these very

53:38.480 --> 53:50.040
 compelling categorizations of the human mind that seem to be sticky in the superego, how

53:50.040 --> 53:52.800
 we talk about these ideas and so on.

53:52.800 --> 53:55.560
 Do you think those are helpful or did they get in the way?

53:55.560 --> 53:59.640
 Is it some kind of balance in terms of deeper understanding of how the mind actually works?

53:59.640 --> 54:08.120
 Yes, from modern neuroscience, whenever we seem to get closer to addressing a question

54:08.120 --> 54:13.120
 like this at the level of cells, it seems to get farther away and I'll give you an example

54:13.120 --> 54:14.840
 of what I mean by that.

54:14.840 --> 54:20.160
 So one thing I'm doing in my laboratory and many people are doing is we are listening

54:20.160 --> 54:28.120
 in on the activity of cells, neurons in the brain of mice or rats or fish or monkeys.

54:28.120 --> 54:29.120
 Individual cells.

54:29.120 --> 54:30.120
 Exactly.

54:30.120 --> 54:37.400
 Of which there are in our brain many billions and when we do and we try to predict what

54:37.400 --> 54:43.780
 action will be taken by an animal to address this question, where does the choice arise?

54:43.780 --> 54:48.880
 Where does the impetus to make a particular selection of one action versus another action?

54:48.880 --> 54:50.120
 Where does that start in the brain?

54:50.120 --> 54:55.320
 If you're recording, listening in on the activity of cells all across the brain, where

54:55.320 --> 55:00.040
 is the earliest spot you can pick up a choice being made?

55:00.040 --> 55:01.040
 Well,

55:01.040 --> 55:02.040
 That's so awesome.

55:02.040 --> 55:03.040
 Yeah.

55:03.040 --> 55:08.040
 At one level, you might think how excited would a young have been to see this or Freud

55:08.040 --> 55:15.160
 or the early psychoanalyst to see where this starts, but it's not so simple because an

55:15.160 --> 55:21.560
 emerging theme in very recent neuroscience literally over the last few years is that things

55:21.560 --> 55:24.440
 sort of all start together all across the brain.

55:24.440 --> 55:29.920
 And so you can be recording from the cortex, this rim of cells at the surface of the brain,

55:29.920 --> 55:35.000
 or you can be recording deeper in a structure called the striatum, which is a little older.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.520
 It's more tightly linked to action.

55:38.520 --> 55:41.760
 And then structures called the thalamus, other parts of the brain.

55:41.760 --> 55:49.120
 And if you record from these, these all sort of represent the action and the choice more

55:49.120 --> 55:51.320
 or less all at about the same time, very close.

55:51.320 --> 55:58.160
 And so it's, you can't point to a particular spot and say, here's where the choice or the

55:58.160 --> 55:59.160
 action originates.

55:59.160 --> 56:00.160
 It's a group.

56:00.160 --> 56:03.880
 It's finding the free will neuron.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.480
 It's relevant to that question.

56:05.480 --> 56:08.400
 Nobody is close to being able to point to such a thing.

56:08.400 --> 56:11.960
 Well, close is a relative term.

56:11.960 --> 56:19.900
 And nobody, what I, what I tweet today, all generalizations are wrong.

56:19.900 --> 56:22.240
 So including this one, let's actually talk about that.

56:22.240 --> 56:29.120
 So the study of individual cells, if you can linger on your sense that as you get closer

56:29.120 --> 56:33.320
 to that understanding, it feels like you're getting farther away.

56:33.320 --> 56:34.320
 Why is that?

56:34.320 --> 56:38.560
 Cause that, that often is the feeling until you're actually there.

56:38.560 --> 56:45.000
 So, so like, you know, see that's when I'm running and I know there's only a mile left.

56:45.000 --> 56:49.120
 It just feels like that mile is just getting longer and longer.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.120
 But eventually you finish.

56:50.120 --> 56:54.960
 So maybe we're getting close to cracking open these like beginnings of a sense, like we'll

56:54.960 --> 57:01.040
 talk about consciousness or these very difficult big questions about the human mind.

57:01.040 --> 57:02.540
 Where do they start?

57:02.540 --> 57:06.920
 You're right to say we shouldn't generalize or make absolutist statements, but I would

57:06.920 --> 57:13.600
 say right now, the reason things are looking even harder to crack than we had initially

57:13.600 --> 57:14.760
 thought.

57:14.760 --> 57:21.200
 We now have the data streams that we've wanted for so long in terms of activity patterns

57:21.200 --> 57:23.280
 all across the brain at the level of cells.

57:23.280 --> 57:29.400
 We can literally see what cells are doing, immense data sets, you know, we get, these

57:29.400 --> 57:34.000
 are, you know, time series of one individual cell with, you know, sub second resolution

57:34.000 --> 57:38.160
 and you can collect this from, you know, enormous numbers of cells across the brain.

57:38.160 --> 57:43.560
 So very rich data sets that we've wanted for a long time and yet having these has not

57:43.560 --> 57:51.720
 led to an understanding of truly where actions initiate in terms of regions or locations.

57:51.720 --> 57:54.240
 I ask a few questions on that.

57:54.240 --> 57:59.720
 Is the answer high level question by your intuition?

57:59.720 --> 58:04.720
 Is the answer within the data or do we need different kind of data?

58:04.720 --> 58:10.560
 So we should also say that when you collect data about the brain, there's like the richness

58:10.560 --> 58:19.360
 of information you're collecting, but there are also human doing stuff, like, and information.

58:19.360 --> 58:23.600
 So static information about the human and dynamic information about the human.

58:23.600 --> 58:27.560
 And you can get them to do different stuff and you can select different humans.

58:27.560 --> 58:30.760
 And that's part of the collection of data aspect.

58:30.760 --> 58:36.400
 So like when you're collecting data about the brain, there's some truths that you can,

58:36.400 --> 58:39.760
 you know, machine learning is like annotations like supervised learning.

58:39.760 --> 58:46.000
 There's some true things you can hold on to before you look at the full rich mess complexity

58:46.000 --> 58:47.680
 of the human mind.

58:47.680 --> 58:53.200
 So given the data you've looked at, do you think the answer for the for the origin of

58:53.200 --> 58:57.440
 free will in the human mind can be found?

58:57.440 --> 59:06.400
 Well, one amazing thing is that nobody's found it, but we have these rich data sets.

59:06.400 --> 59:11.520
 And then there's a conundrum, which is, is it in the data, and we just don't know how

59:11.520 --> 59:12.520
 to look at it.

59:12.520 --> 59:16.040
 Maybe we don't know the right scale, the right projection to make of the data, the right

59:16.040 --> 59:17.840
 way to interpret it.

59:17.840 --> 59:22.960
 And here's where causal testing becomes very valuable, because then instead of just passively

59:22.960 --> 59:29.360
 observing, well, here are here the activity patterns, and then here's the choice made

59:29.360 --> 59:37.320
 by the animal as we've gotten more powerful at reaching in and causing things to happen

59:37.320 --> 59:43.960
 in the brain, turning up or down the activity of certain types of cells or defined populations

59:43.960 --> 59:46.440
 of cells and seeing how that affects actions.

59:46.440 --> 59:50.560
 These causal perturbations have turned out to be very valuable.

59:50.560 --> 59:57.800
 We're just now getting to the point where we can apply these in very wide swaths of

59:57.800 --> 1:00:02.520
 the brain at cellular resolution, and so we're going to be able hopefully to make some headway

1:00:02.520 --> 1:00:05.280
 on this question with causality.

1:00:05.280 --> 1:00:10.280
 And that's the one thing that Optogenetics provides us this way of using light that we

1:00:10.280 --> 1:00:12.320
 developed to control cells.

1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:17.480
 This is an untapped, relatively untapped at this broad brain wide scale, and hopefully

1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:18.960
 we can get there in the near future.

1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:24.040
 But I would say that the answer may be in the data, but we don't know how to find it.

1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:28.640
 Well, there's this interactive element like where you can cause stuff that's really powerful

1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:34.320
 because you get to, I mean, as opposed to collecting data passively, you're collecting

1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:35.320
 data actively.

1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:39.920
 So can you maybe describe one of the many things you're known for?

1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:42.480
 One of the big things is called Optogenetics.

1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:43.480
 What is it?

1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:46.240
 Optogenetics is a way of causing things to happen.

1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:53.320
 It's a way of determining what actually matters in terms of the activity of the brain for

1:00:53.320 --> 1:00:54.320
 the amazing things.

1:00:54.320 --> 1:01:01.840
 It does sensation, cognition, action, and what it does is it provides activity.

1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:07.640
 It's a way of playing in, if you will, activity patterns into precisely defined cells.

1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:11.360
 And the way we do it is pretty cool, I think.

1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:12.360
 Right away there's a problem.

1:01:12.360 --> 1:01:16.240
 If you think about how do we do this, how could we play in well defined activity patterns

1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:21.920
 and provide a stream of activity into this cell and that cell and that cell, but not these

1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:22.920
 other cells?

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:32.400
 So just for context, we're talking about the brains of mice, monkeys, humans, and then

1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:38.760
 the goal is to try to control accurately the behavior of a single neuron and then to be

1:01:38.760 --> 1:01:47.480
 able to monitor single collection of single neurons to then say, well, to draw some deeper

1:01:47.480 --> 1:01:53.480
 insight about the origins, first of all, the function of different parts of the brain,

1:01:53.480 --> 1:01:58.080
 different neurons, different kinds of neurons, but also the origins of the big things, the

1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:04.240
 flap of the butterfly wing that leads to an actual behavioral thing.

1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:05.240
 So if you could, exactly.

1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:11.200
 So if you could turn on or off the brain or parts of the brain or cell types or individual

1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:19.480
 cells at the natural rate and rhythm and timing of normal brain activity, that would be immensely

1:02:19.480 --> 1:02:23.440
 valid because you could determine what actually mattered, what could cause complex things to

1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:27.840
 happen and what could prevent complex things from happening in a specific way.

1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:32.840
 But right away you've got a problem if you want to do this and neuroscientists have wanted

1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:34.320
 to do this for a long time.

1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:40.640
 Francis Crick of Double Helix of DNA fame, he wrote a famous paper in 1999.

1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:46.640
 He got interested in neuroscience later in life and he said, what we need in neuroscience

1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:54.320
 is a way that we could turn on or off the activity of individual types of neurons in

1:02:54.320 --> 1:02:56.880
 a behaving animal.

1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:04.480
 And he even said the ideal signal would be light because it would be fast, it could penetrate

1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:08.320
 through the brain to some extent.

1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:14.160
 And he had no idea how to do it, he said this would probably be very farfetched but it would

1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:15.160
 be a good thing.

1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:19.200
 And so that's what you're actually saying, like if you want to do this kind of thing

1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:22.960
 and imagine like, how do I get inside the brain?

1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:24.800
 It's pretty difficult to do.

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:25.800
 It's pretty difficult.

1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:30.080
 And then even once you get in, it's hard because all brain cells are electrical, all neurons

1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:31.480
 are electrically activated.

1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:38.240
 And so if you wanted to use electricity as what you were putting in, you won't have any

1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:39.480
 specificity at all.

1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:43.560
 If you have an electrode, a wire and you put it in the brain and you send current through

1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:48.360
 it, all the cells near the electrode will be stimulated.

1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:52.120
 That's like trying to control fish by spraying them with water.

1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:57.600
 Yeah, right, because there's already a lot of electricity going around anyway and you're

1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:02.440
 adding more, but there's no specificity, even among the different kinds of cells either

1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:06.440
 because all around the wire that you've put in, there are going to be so many different

1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:10.720
 cells doing totally different things, many of them in opposition to each other.

1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:12.320
 We know that's one way the brain is set up.

1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:16.960
 There are parts of the brain that where neurons side by side are doing completely different

1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:20.320
 things and maybe even antagonistic to each other.

1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:21.320
 So what do you do?

1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:23.920
 How do you play in activity with any kind of specificity?

1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:32.320
 Well, what you do is use, what we found is what you can do is make some cells responsive

1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:33.320
 to light.

1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:37.720
 Now normally, no cells deep in the brain really respond to light.

1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:39.240
 They're not built for that.

1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:44.920
 There's no reason for them to respond to light in there, which is a great situation to start

1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:49.960
 with because any light sensitivity you can provide to some cells will be a huge signal

1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:51.720
 above the noise.

1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:59.600
 And so that's what we do with optogenetics, we take genes, bits of DNA from microbes,

1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:09.280
 single celled organisms and these single celled organisms like algae, they make little proteins

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:15.360
 that sit in the surface of their cells that receive light, capture a photon of light and

1:05:15.360 --> 1:05:20.280
 open up a little hole in the membrane of the cell and let charge particles, ions like

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:24.600
 sodium and potassium flow across the membrane of the cell.

1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:29.400
 And that, these algae and bacteria, they do this for their own reasons because that helps

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:34.480
 them move and helps them make and use energy.

1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:39.080
 But that's a beautiful thing for neuroscience because movement of ions charge particles

1:05:39.080 --> 1:05:43.520
 across the membrane of the cell is exactly the kind of electricity that neurons work

1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:44.520
 with.

1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:49.520
 So if we can take this bit of DNA that encodes this beautiful protein that turns light into

1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:55.960
 electricity from algae and if we can put it into some neurons but not other neurons,

1:05:55.960 --> 1:06:00.000
 which we can do using genetic tricks, then you've got a situation, then you can shine

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:05.760
 on the light and only the cells that have the gene and that are expressing the gene

1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:09.280
 will be the initial direct cells that are activated by the light.

1:06:09.280 --> 1:06:12.640
 And so that's the essence of optogenetics is the ability to do that.

1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:15.560
 We get that initial specificity that you could never get with an electrode.

1:06:15.560 --> 1:06:22.040
 First of all, let me say that this is, we recently got the Alaska Prize for this.

1:06:22.040 --> 1:06:25.880
 It's a brilliant idea.

1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:33.680
 So I talked to Andrew Huberman, who's a friend of yours, friend of mine, not to jinx things,

1:06:33.680 --> 1:06:36.880
 but he believes that you deserve the Nobel Prize for this.

1:06:36.880 --> 1:06:45.440
 So I do too, but what my votes, anyway, the thing is, it doesn't matter, prizes will

1:06:45.440 --> 1:06:46.440
 be all forgotten.

1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:47.440
 All of us will be forgotten.

1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:51.800
 One of the cool ideas, a cool idea, that's a really powerful idea.

1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:57.720
 It's actually the origins of it you might be interested in are even are very deep.

1:06:57.720 --> 1:07:03.440
 There was a botanist in St. Petersburg named Andre Femenson in 1866.

1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:09.440
 He published a paper on the single celled green algae and he was the botanist who first

1:07:09.440 --> 1:07:12.200
 noticed that they moved in response to light.

1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:16.840
 These are tiny single celled algae that have flagella, so they swim through the water.

1:07:16.840 --> 1:07:23.960
 And he noticed this, he was a botanist, and he published this, it was a paper, you know,

1:07:23.960 --> 1:07:28.560
 he wrote in German, but he published it in a French journal and he was doing it from

1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:29.560
 St. Petersburg.

1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:35.440
 So it was a very international effort, but you have to go back to 1866 and that, I like

1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:41.160
 to highlight how far back that discovery goes is back to Andre Femenson.

1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:45.840
 And this is a, it highlights the value of just pure basic science discovery.

1:07:45.840 --> 1:07:50.640
 That always originates somewhere in the Eastern European bloc.

1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:56.680
 But I don't think he expected the splicing of genetic material from the algae into the

1:07:56.680 --> 1:07:57.680
 human brain.

1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:00.520
 And one of the cool things we've been able to do now with modern methods is to really

1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:02.080
 study these proteins.

1:08:02.080 --> 1:08:05.560
 And so we've discovered some of these proteins other groups have as well.

1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:10.400
 We've dived deep into their structure, just like the double helix structure of DNA was

1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:12.600
 uncovered with Xray crystallography.

1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:17.440
 We used the same method, Xray crystallography, to see how these beautiful little proteins

1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:18.440
 work.

1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:20.120
 We reengineered them for all kinds of function.

1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:23.720
 We can make them instead of responding to blue light, we can make them respond to red

1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:24.720
 light.

1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:26.440
 We can speed them up, slow them down.

1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:31.160
 We can make them with genetic engineering, we can make them have different ions flow

1:08:31.160 --> 1:08:32.440
 through them.

1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:36.880
 And so it's this convergence, as you said, like the botanist in 1866 couldn't have predicted

1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:41.360
 what we could do with this, and the fact that we've been able to discover how these beautiful

1:08:41.360 --> 1:08:46.360
 proteins work and then apply them to neuroscience is really a thrilling story.

1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:52.240
 Is it possible to achieve scale, do you think, with this, meaning like what is the progress

1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:57.600
 of the next 50 years, 100 years looks like, in terms of the precision and the scale of

1:08:57.600 --> 1:08:59.320
 control of using light?

1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:01.800
 It's going so fast, it's hard to predict.

1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:11.560
 I'll give you a sense of it, though, in first paper, we published in 2005, that was just

1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:16.640
 in cultured neurons, by 2007, so that was in a dish, by 2007 we had it working in behaving

1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:22.960
 mice, by 2009 we had it pretty general, so we had methods to really make it a versatile

1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:26.360
 method, it could be applied to essentially any cell.

1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:32.000
 By 2012, we could get to single cell resolution, we used light guidance strategies to target

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:36.600
 individual cells in the brain of a living mouse.

1:09:36.600 --> 1:09:44.760
 By 2019, we were able to control up to 20 to 50 individually specified single cells

1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:50.080
 in the brain of a mouse in ways that specifically changed its behavior, that could bias its

1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:51.680
 decisions one way or the other.

1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:59.920
 In fact, we could take a mouse and without any visual stimulus at all, we could make

1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:05.760
 it act as if it had seen a particular visual stimulus by playing in, using the single cell

1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:12.280
 resolution optogenetics, a specific pattern of activity into 20 or 25 individually specified

1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:13.280
 cells.

1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:18.840
 That's 2019, to your question of scale, now in 2022 we're controlling hundreds of individually

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:26.520
 specified single cells over all of visual cortex of a mouse, all the part of the brain

1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:31.000
 that is the initial direct target of the incoming information from the retina.

1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:34.480
 Are you constrained to specific types of cells currently?

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:39.800
 Like you mentioned long range is easier, is there constraints on which cells?

1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:44.880
 Now there really isn't, now that we have this individual cell guidance, we can target any

1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:54.800
 individual kind of cell very reliably, and so now to your question of scale, how far

1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:55.800
 can we go?

1:10:55.800 --> 1:11:00.480
 Well, things are moving quickly, it's hard to say.

1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:04.600
 We can access individual cells across the entire brain now.

1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:12.280
 If you look 10, 20 years in the future, I think we'll surprise ourselves, but the fact

1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:17.560
 that we're already able to cause specific perceptions to happen in specific actions

1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:26.080
 means we're essentially where we want to be, and now it's a matter of just more experiments,

1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:30.000
 more discoveries, but the basic principles are clear now.

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.240
 The basic capability is there.

1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:36.840
 Is there a pathway to doing the same for humans?

1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:40.920
 Optogenetics is primarily, it's a discovery tool that really is well suited for use in

1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:49.840
 mice and rats and monkeys, because it involves putting in a gene and also delivering light,

1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:54.760
 and those are two things that you can do in human beings, but you'd want to do in a very

1:11:54.760 --> 1:11:55.760
 careful way.

1:11:55.760 --> 1:12:01.200
 Now, that said, there is actually just less than a year ago, my friend Botan Roska in

1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:09.120
 Switzerland, he did the first human optogenetics therapy, and he published this in the journal

1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:10.120
 Nature Medicine.

1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:17.440
 So about 10, 12 years ago, he and I published a paper together where we gave him one of

1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:26.240
 our optogenetic tools, one of these light activated regulators of ion flow, these are

1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:32.320
 called microbial opcins, by the way, opcins, and he put one of those into an extracted

1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:38.320
 retina from a human being who had died, so it was a cataviric retina, and he was able

1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:45.320
 to show that optical control in this paper was able to turn on or off individual cells

1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:46.560
 in the human retina.

1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:48.600
 So that was a while back.

1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:55.280
 He spent about 10 years of going through all the regulatory hoops and hurdles and going

1:12:55.280 --> 1:13:01.400
 through primate studies, and finally he was able to take a human being with a retinal

1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:06.880
 degeneration syndrome, so someone who was blind in both eyes.

1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:16.440
 And he gave one of these opcins into one eye of this human being who was blind and with

1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:23.660
 the goal of conferring light sensitivity onto this retina that was not able to see light,

1:13:23.660 --> 1:13:26.600
 and he was able to make this person see through that eye.

1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:31.480
 So he took a blind person and the blind person could see now, could reach for objects selectively

1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:38.520
 on a table, and he published this in Nature Medicine, and it was, you know, that's an

1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:39.520
 amazing thing.

1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:40.520
 Do you know the title of the paper?

1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:41.520
 What's his name again?

1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:42.520
 Rosca.

1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:43.520
 R.O.S.K.A.

1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:45.320
 Can you look up the nature paper?

1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:46.320
 Yeah, Nature Medicine.

1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:47.820
 Nature Medicine.

1:13:47.820 --> 1:13:49.440
 So that's sort of proof of principle.

1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:51.320
 Now the retina is very accessible.

1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:52.760
 It's near the surface.

1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:57.800
 You can use natural light or you can use brighter natural light.

1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:02.040
 I'm, myself, I see optogenetics as a discovery tool.

1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:05.720
 It's a way to figure out the principles by which the brain works and how it operates.

1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:10.240
 Partial recovery, visual function in a blind patient after optogenetic therapy.

1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:16.400
 So he went through the full process of doing primates, studies, and then going, well, that's

1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:20.640
 dedication and that's really exciting to see.

1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:26.200
 As beautiful as that is, and I'm glad he did all that work, there are so many other ways

1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:28.680
 that optogenetics could help with therapies.

1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:33.040
 Once you know the principles, then any kind of therapy can become more powerful.

1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:40.240
 Once you know the causal cells in a symptom like in lack of motivation or inability to

1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:44.080
 enjoy things or altered sleep or altered energy.

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:48.760
 Once you know the cells that are causal, then you can make medications that address those

1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:49.760
 cells.

1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:53.560
 You could address brain stimulation treatments that might address those cells.

1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:59.800
 Also diagnosis, maybe a very effective systematic way of diagnosing, or at least providing you

1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:06.640
 rich data to some of these deep questions about schizophrenia, about bipolar, all those

1:15:06.640 --> 1:15:14.200
 kinds of things that are, the tools are low resolution currently for determining the degree

1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:17.640
 to which you have a thing and whether you have a thing at all.

1:15:17.640 --> 1:15:18.640
 Yeah.

1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:19.640
 Exactly.

1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:28.200
 So my hope is, that's a great example of how you can cure or you can provide some relief

1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:34.120
 for a symptom of a person who has a serious degenerative disease.

1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:37.400
 But the principles are what we're after.

1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:41.440
 That's why I spend, even though I'm a psychiatrist, even though I still see patients, I'm not

1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:45.400
 myself trying to drive any clinical trials in the lab.

1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:51.000
 I'm trying to discover and then any kind of therapy could result from that.

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:58.440
 What do you think about my friend Elon Musk and his efforts with Neuralink?

1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:04.400
 So this is another, there's a lot of things to say here because there's a lot of ideas

1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:10.600
 under the umbrella of Neuralink, but one of them is to use electrical signals to stimulate

1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:16.600
 and then you also record, you collect electrical signals from the brain at a higher and higher

1:16:16.600 --> 1:16:24.280
 resolution and you go implant surgically the methods by which you do the stimulation

1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:26.480
 and the data collection.

1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:33.720
 So it's possible for the ideas of optogenetics to play well with this and we can even zoom

1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:40.160
 out outside of just Neuralink and just the whole idea of brain computer interfaces.

1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:41.160
 What are your thoughts?

1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:44.560
 Well, I think the engineering that they've done is actually pretty cool.

1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:52.680
 So I like the robots, from the design perspective and it was a design approach that wasn't being

1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:57.480
 taken in academia and it's great that they did it and I think it's pretty cool.

1:16:57.480 --> 1:16:59.200
 So I'll say that.

1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:05.160
 Also there are many ways that you can record from many thousands of neurons and that's

1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:06.160
 not the only way.

1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:08.080
 It's a very interesting way.

1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:14.240
 We and others are using brain penetrating electrodes that actually get quite deep.

1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:16.520
 The whole structure of the brain is very interesting.

1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:21.840
 There's the surface cortex where it's the most recently emergent part of the brain

1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:23.920
 and evolution.

1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:24.920
 Mammals have it.

1:17:24.920 --> 1:17:29.960
 Reptiles have something a little bit like it, but it's not really the whole thing.

1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:31.160
 This is a very recent thing.

1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:35.720
 That's what we can access with some of these, like the Neuralink approach and with some

1:17:35.720 --> 1:17:38.360
 of these short electrodes.

1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:40.760
 This part of the brain in the cortex is only a few millimeters thick.

1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:43.000
 There's so much that's deep though that's so important.

1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:44.000
 There's the striatum.

1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:45.000
 There's the thalamus.

1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:51.720
 There are the parts of the brain that drive motivation, that drive hunger and thirst and

1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:58.200
 social interaction and parenting and flight and fear and anxiety.

1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:02.280
 All these things are, there's so much that's deep that these surface approaches are not

1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:03.280
 getting to.

1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:08.040
 Some are deep and others are using these very long electrodes that help us get deep.

1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:11.600
 We can still record for many cells, many thousands of cells.

1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:15.760
 We can have multiple of these at once in the same animal.

1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:18.440
 There's a diversity of methods to get to this goal.

1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:27.000
 I think it's great that people coming from outside academia will bring ideas that weren't

1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.080
 being worked on, at least approaches.

1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:31.280
 They may turn out to be synergistic.

1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:37.560
 These things do work very well with optogenetics because all these electrical recording methods,

1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:39.800
 that's one channel of information flow.

1:18:39.800 --> 1:18:43.280
 Light delivery is a separate, more or less independent.

1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:47.760
 There can be some artifacts that happen, but if you're careful, that's another independent

1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:50.080
 pathway of information flow.

1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:54.780
 We've done really fun experiments in mice where we play in patterns of activity with

1:18:54.780 --> 1:19:00.800
 light and we record activity from all across the brain of a mouse, electrically.

1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:04.800
 Using optical and electrical together is extremely powerful.

1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:12.680
 Optoelectric brain computer interfaces, which, by the way, there's efforts on the computing

1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:19.280
 side to build optoelectric servers where you have both electricity.

1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:20.280
 Optics is really interesting.

1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:25.280
 Light is a very interesting method of communication that's, like you said, orthogonal in many

1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:26.280
 ways.

1:19:26.280 --> 1:19:32.560
 It doesn't have some of the constraints of bandwidth that electricity does go into wires,

1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:39.080
 but you're able to, but it's less ability to control precisely at scale.

1:19:39.080 --> 1:19:43.000
 There's challenges and there's benefits and having those two interplays is really, really

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:48.240
 fascinating, especially when, obviously, on the other side of your signal is a biological

1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:54.320
 mesh, mush, mushy mesh.

1:19:54.320 --> 1:19:57.600
 The mushy mesh is kind of interesting because there are problems with light.

1:19:57.600 --> 1:20:02.680
 Light scatters in the brain, so the photons don't just go linearly through.

1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:08.120
 Whenever they hit an interface between fat and water, lipid and water, they bounce off

1:20:08.120 --> 1:20:09.520
 in different directions.

1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:11.960
 You can come in with all the resolution you want.

1:20:11.960 --> 1:20:17.120
 You could play in an incredibly detailed high resolution pattern of light, but the photons

1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:22.280
 start scattering quite quickly and by the time you've gone a couple of millimeters deep,

1:20:22.280 --> 1:20:26.440
 you've lost almost all that fine spatial information.

1:20:26.440 --> 1:20:28.000
 But we've developed workarounds.

1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:32.120
 The longer wavelength light you use, if you get into the infrared, there's less scattering.

1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:36.520
 You can use two photon methods or three photon methods where the photons have to arrive all

1:20:36.520 --> 1:20:38.560
 together at the same time.

1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:40.160
 You can put in fiber optics.

1:20:40.160 --> 1:20:44.960
 We developed these fiber optic methods in 2007 where you can access these deep structures

1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:48.600
 with fiber optic methods and you can put in many of these fiber optics at the same time

1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:49.600
 in an animal.

1:20:49.600 --> 1:20:56.160
 We've used holographic methods, 3D holograms to play in, hundreds of individual cell sized

1:20:56.160 --> 1:20:59.360
 spots of light and we can change those quickly.

1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:03.240
 So there are a lot of tricks, a lot of interesting optics engineering that has come together with

1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:04.760
 neuroscience in a pretty exciting way.

1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:07.640
 Oh, it is engineering too, which is super, super, super exciting.

1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:10.800
 I should mention, because I remember, I mentioned Elon.

1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:18.120
 I recently got, for the first time ever, got COVID.

1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:23.640
 How did I go so long without the, finally, so I'm all vaccinated and everything like

1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:24.640
 that.

1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:29.320
 And so I got, because I think he mentioned it publicly so I can mention it, but I won't

1:21:29.320 --> 1:21:34.000
 mention anybody else involved, but hanging out, we all got, you know, I got COVID.

1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.600
 And the interesting thing about, maybe you can comment about this.

1:21:36.600 --> 1:21:38.840
 So I was only sick for like a half a day.

1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:44.120
 I got a fever of like 104, I just went up and then crashed.

1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:53.000
 And then I was, now, maybe I'm just seeing the silver lining of everything, but afterwards,

1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:57.640
 I have like a greater clarity about the world.

1:21:57.640 --> 1:21:59.680
 You just think it's greater clarity.

1:21:59.680 --> 1:22:06.880
 Maybe I just, it was so, maybe so intensely, the mind fog kind of thing for such a short

1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:12.200
 amount of time, but the people were involved were also reporting this.

1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:19.760
 It's kind of interesting because like, because I do know like the immune system is involved

1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:21.960
 with the brain in very interesting ways.

1:22:21.960 --> 1:22:27.200
 So like the human mind also incorporates all these other, it's not just the, it's not just

1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:28.200
 the nervous system.

1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:32.040
 And I just wanted, because everyone always says, not, not like, everyone always says

1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:36.160
 like COVID does all these bad things or whatever the disease is or whatever the virus.

1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:40.600
 But I wonder like, hate to be a Steven Pink around this, but like, I wonder what the

1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:46.680
 benefits of certain disease are, if you're like, what is there's some like, again, don't

1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:50.560
 want to romanticize it, but if your system goes to some kind of hardship and you come

1:22:50.560 --> 1:22:55.920
 out on the other end, I wonder sometimes if there's a greater, maybe killed off a bunch

1:22:55.920 --> 1:22:58.960
 of neurons that I didn't need anyway, and they were actually getting in the way.

1:22:58.960 --> 1:22:59.960
 There were the hater neurons.

1:22:59.960 --> 1:23:00.960
 Well, I don't know.

1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:02.960
 You're inner critic that I was talking about.

1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:03.960
 Exactly.

1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:04.960
 You killed off your critic.

1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:09.240
 Well, you know, there are mechanisms for what, the potential mechanisms for what you're

1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:10.560
 talking about.

1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:18.120
 There are, there's actually been a fair bit of research on post COVID neurological function.

1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:22.400
 And actually, my wife, Michelle Manje, who's at Stanford, she's done a lot of this work.

1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:25.640
 Hiko Iwasaki, Yale has done a lot of this.

1:23:25.640 --> 1:23:30.400
 But what they found is that there's a loss of myelin.

1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:35.800
 This is the coding of those long range projections that go from one part of the brain to another.

1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:39.960
 Myelin is this sort of insulator that coats these long range projections and makes the

1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:43.960
 impulses go faster and more reliably.

1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:51.640
 And there's altered function of the myelin producing cells and altered myelin in the

1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:52.640
 case of COVID.

1:23:52.640 --> 1:23:57.080
 They've looked in both mouse and human brains.

1:23:57.080 --> 1:24:00.280
 And but of course, it could be very idiosyncratic.

1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:03.520
 Many people have cognitive problems post COVID.

1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:04.600
 You're definitely aware of that.

1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:09.040
 So many people report this persistent brain fog and the ability to function.

1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:11.760
 But it depends on where the inflammation was.

1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:17.360
 Maybe the people who have dysfunction post COVID, they had a global effect.

1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:24.320
 Maybe you lost some of these projections that were restraining you in some way and these

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:31.280
 plausibly exist and it's known that there are cell populations in the prefrontal cortex

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:36.960
 that actively restrain deeper structures from expressing what they do.

1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:42.600
 And it's theoretically possible that you had a lucky so many has to get lucky, right?

1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:44.240
 Somebody has to get lucky.

1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:45.240
 Why not?

1:24:45.240 --> 1:24:46.240
 All right.

1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:55.880
 If we can actually go back to this idea of trying through optogenetics to find origins

1:24:55.880 --> 1:25:08.800
 of when the way first starts, origins of a decision, origin of idea, origin of maybe

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:15.240
 consciousness or the subjective experience or origin of things in the mind.

1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:22.120
 So one thing is Carl Jung, is there a God neuron?

1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:24.160
 Is there a belief neuron?

1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:34.200
 Is there so through this methodology of optogenetics, can you start getting to like where a belief

1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:41.800
 begins or an idea begins and especially looking at the strongest of our beliefs, maybe beliefs

1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:52.080
 of love and hate, but religious belief into something like really grand on the grandest

1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:54.400
 of scale?

1:25:54.400 --> 1:26:00.600
 Neuroscience and neurology point us a little bit.

1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:01.920
 We don't have an answer to that.

1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:06.440
 But a lot of these questions I'm going to ask you, there's no good answer, but you're

1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:09.600
 providing the tools that give us hope to find the answer one day.

1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:10.600
 Yeah.

1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:11.600
 And we have early clues.

1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:19.640
 So for example, when patients with epilepsy have experiences of religiosity as part of

1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:27.720
 their seizure or the aura before their seizure, very often those are in the temporal lobe

1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:31.360
 in these parts of the brain that are at the side.

1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:34.480
 And so that's initial clue.

1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:42.840
 There are also parts of the brain that are involved in the definition of the self and

1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:47.160
 defining the borders or boundaries of the self.

1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:50.520
 And we know this, this is some experiments that we did in my lab.

1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:56.880
 There's a part of the brain where if there's a rhythm of a particular type, you can cause

1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:02.920
 a separation of the sense of self from the sense of the body.

1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:07.960
 What's normally bound up and unitary, we normally think of ourself and our body is pretty tightly

1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:08.960
 bound up together.

1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:10.400
 Those can be separated, it turns out.

1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:13.280
 We can't take that for granted and there are certain conditions, certain patterns of

1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:19.800
 activity in one part of the brain called the retrosplenial cortex where you can actually

1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:21.000
 separate those two out.

1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:30.280
 And so if you think about these very big questions, where are the origins of religiosity?

1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:36.760
 How do we define the boundaries of who we are relative to others and to the world?

1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:42.240
 How do we link ourself to our body and how can that become separated?

1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:48.400
 These are actually, believe it or not, now accessible and rigorously and quantitatively.

1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:55.160
 So we did an experiment with optogenetics where we provided this abnormal rhythm to

1:27:55.160 --> 1:28:02.520
 this particular part of the mouse brain and we saw this separation of detection of a stimulus

1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:04.720
 and caring about it.

1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:10.200
 So that's like stimulating something about the mouse brain that affects these neurons

1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:12.040
 that give the conception of self.

1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:18.040
 Also you're able to dissociate the experience from the impact of the experience onto you.

1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:19.040
 That's right.

1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:20.040
 Exactly right.

1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:26.000
 So these are the goals of meditation, these are the goals whenever I get drunk, pretty

1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.000
 much effective.

1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:32.320
 I mean, that's not a scientific statement, just an experiential anecdotal one.

1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:38.120
 Also psychedelics seek to attain this kind of state.

1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:39.120
 That's so interesting.

1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:45.680
 Well, you mentioned psychedelics, DMT and 5MEO, DMT, these create this religious experience,

1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:49.760
 this connection, people describe them as a strong connection to God.

1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:53.520
 In theory, these are accessible with modern methods.

1:28:53.520 --> 1:29:00.720
 Now that we have these rich recording methods, we can explore what are the precise millisecond

1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:06.760
 resolution, cellular resolution, brainwide manifestations of these altered states.

1:29:06.760 --> 1:29:14.680
 So like you could look at an altered state like on DMT recorded across many people and

1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:20.400
 then from there see where do these experiences originate in the brain in terms of single

1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:27.000
 neurons and then how do they propagate and interact with everything else and if there's

1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:35.200
 some kind of common signal, like how do you narrow down the set of neurons that are responsible

1:29:35.200 --> 1:29:39.040
 for particular experience or for particular behavioral effect?

1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:45.520
 Here's where optogenetics is so useful because anytime you give an agent like an agent like

1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:51.000
 ketamine or PCP, which we used for our dissociation experiments that I was mentioning, or you

1:29:51.000 --> 1:30:00.760
 have a psychedelic LSD or DMT for this altered perceptual state, if you give either of those,

1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:04.000
 these change everything across the brain.

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:10.080
 That's the fact that you maybe give them to a mouse, let's say, or eventually to a human.

1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:17.800
 You won't know yet which cells to home in on as the causal players in all this just by

1:30:17.800 --> 1:30:19.520
 recording the activity.

1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:24.840
 But then what we found is that optogenetics providing a causal pattern of activity guided

1:30:24.840 --> 1:30:31.280
 by what you see can let you test hypotheses and we saw this rhythm with ketamine and PCP

1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:35.920
 for dissociation and then we said, okay, let's test what's causal.

1:30:35.920 --> 1:30:38.160
 We came in and provided that rhythm.

1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:42.160
 We tried a few different things, but only one of the causal tests we tried actually

1:30:42.160 --> 1:30:45.240
 caused the behavioral dissociation.

1:30:45.240 --> 1:30:47.360
 And so that's how we home in on what actually matters.

1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:51.280
 And is it repeatable once you see the, so like that's one definition of causality is

1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:57.000
 like you try and it repeats across different mice and all that kind of stuff.

1:30:57.000 --> 1:30:58.240
 Exactly.

1:30:58.240 --> 1:31:02.080
 And so you could do that for DMT, you could do that for the, like the really fascinating

1:31:02.080 --> 1:31:05.080
 mind expanding.

1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:06.080
 Thank you.

1:31:06.080 --> 1:31:07.080
 Thank you.

1:31:07.080 --> 1:31:08.480
 So the meme for people just listening.

1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:15.240
 This is again another disagreement between Freud and Carl Jung, religion and spirituality.

1:31:15.240 --> 1:31:20.200
 This is the, I guess the ring scene from Lord of the Rings, religion and spirituality.

1:31:20.200 --> 1:31:23.640
 Freud says cast it into the fire, destroy it.

1:31:23.640 --> 1:31:25.440
 Carl Jung says no.

1:31:25.440 --> 1:31:31.760
 So for people who don't know, Sergei is the Slavic Lord of the meme.

1:31:31.760 --> 1:31:32.760
 Thank you.

1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:33.880
 I appreciate that.

1:31:33.880 --> 1:31:37.520
 So what we're talking about, so there is, I mean, I think a connection between DMT and

1:31:37.520 --> 1:31:45.120
 religious experiences or some of these psychedelics, do you think it's possible to sort of stimulate

1:31:45.120 --> 1:31:47.520
 religious experiences?

1:31:47.520 --> 1:31:52.120
 So religious experiences are one of the most deep kind of experiences.

1:31:52.120 --> 1:32:00.280
 And so here you could first understand where they originate, how they propagate to the

1:32:00.280 --> 1:32:05.080
 brain and then to stimulate them.

1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:11.160
 And so this is, and these that can happen in people who had no predisposition, you know,

1:32:11.160 --> 1:32:16.960
 people who are, you know, as agnostic or atheistic as you'd like, they can have these, they can

1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:19.640
 feel connected to God in these, in these states.

1:32:19.640 --> 1:32:22.080
 Now, to be clear, I'm not advocating these.

1:32:22.080 --> 1:32:27.440
 We don't know what's safe in human beings, but we definitely have not yet, but we definitely

1:32:27.440 --> 1:32:32.880
 can do these experiments in mice and that was already very productive in understanding

1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:33.880
 dissociation.

1:32:33.880 --> 1:32:37.480
 So we can already imagine making headway on these methods.

1:32:37.480 --> 1:32:42.960
 And then, you know, I had a, and this does map onto the non psychedelic human experience.

1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:47.360
 I had a patient who's actually described in the book, Projections.

1:32:47.360 --> 1:32:51.760
 This was the patient that's in the mania chapter, the bipolar chapter.

1:32:51.760 --> 1:32:57.440
 Here was a guy who had never had a psychiatric illness or symptom in his life.

1:32:57.440 --> 1:33:03.000
 He was a retirement age gentleman and nobody in his family either.

1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:06.440
 So no family history, no personal history of any psychiatric illness, and he had never

1:33:06.440 --> 1:33:11.840
 been religious particularly before either, certainly no, no passionate, you know, type

1:33:11.840 --> 1:33:13.440
 of religion.

1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:18.320
 And he, not through any psychedelic or drug, he had a stressful experience, actually a

1:33:18.320 --> 1:33:24.880
 post 9.11 change in how he was thinking, and he was pushed into a mania, a manic state

1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:31.160
 revealing that he had bipolar, never before known in this case, in this person.

1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:37.160
 And his mania, his elevated state in bipolar included this profound religiosity he had,

1:33:37.160 --> 1:33:46.240
 which he'd never had before, and he was preaching in an elevated, vigorous way to his family.

1:33:46.240 --> 1:33:52.000
 And so this state can be created in people even late in life who had no predisposition

1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:55.080
 for it and no, even without a neurochemical.

1:33:55.080 --> 1:34:00.800
 So there's the causality of that is very interesting to explore.

1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:05.200
 How did the manic state unleash this religiosity?

1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:11.720
 But you see that in other realms of psychiatry too, OCD can manifest as religiosity also.

1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:17.680
 You can take people who never really had a, religion never played a powerful role in their

1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:22.600
 life, but then when their obsessive compulsive symptoms become severe, they can manifest

1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:23.600
 in this.

1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:24.600
 I think I'm in that group.

1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:26.400
 So I'm a bit OCD.

1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:32.960
 We have, there's, I think these subreddits, when it's oddly satisfying things.

1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:39.920
 So there's certain things that are really satisfying to my OCD, in my mild OCD, I think

1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:42.120
 it's pretty much a religious experience.

1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:48.440
 So I understand that there's, if it's not directed, it's at least rhymes.

1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:55.200
 So maybe can you speak to the, as Sergei is probably desperately scrambling to pull up

1:34:55.200 --> 1:34:56.360
 oddly satisfying.

1:34:56.360 --> 1:34:57.360
 Thank you.

1:34:57.360 --> 1:34:58.360
 People can check it out themselves.

1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:03.120
 It is, as the subreddit promises, oddly satisfying.

1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:05.960
 Can we talk about bipolar?

1:35:05.960 --> 1:35:06.960
 They may be depression.

1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:13.840
 Well, let's talk about, I mean, I don't know if there's a nice way to discuss the differences

1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:21.800
 in the full landscape of suffering that's here, but maybe what is depression and what

1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:23.400
 are the types of depression?

1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:30.520
 What kind of depression have you seen and experienced and researched and how can people

1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:31.520
 overcome it?

1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:36.400
 How can humans overcome it and deal with it, live with it and overcome it?

1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:38.920
 So this is my clinical specialty.

1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:44.520
 I see patients in my outpatient clinical work with treatment resistant depression.

1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:51.560
 So very hard to treat severe illness where medications haven't been working.

1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:54.680
 I also see patients with autism spectrum disorders.

1:35:54.680 --> 1:36:02.680
 These are my two clinical focal areas, but then I do emergency room work as well.

1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:06.640
 But the depression, why do I focus on that?

1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:16.200
 It's so, one feels tantalizingly close to helping these people who are suffering so

1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:17.200
 deeply.

1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:21.440
 One of the things that I've focused on it is these are people who, there may not even

1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:25.520
 be anything situational that's difficult or challenging in their life.

1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:29.160
 You can have people who seem to have everything that you would want.

1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:40.160
 Every objective measure of the life is fine, and yet they can be just hit with this unstoppable

1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:46.680
 hopelessness and inability to see into the future, a discounting of the value of their

1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:47.680
 own action.

1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:54.600
 Anything they can imagine themselves doing seems worthless or they are unable to enjoy

1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:55.600
 things.

1:36:55.600 --> 1:36:56.600
 We call this anhedonia.

1:36:56.600 --> 1:37:02.520
 There's no reward, no pleasure, not in food, social interaction, movies, books, anything

1:37:02.520 --> 1:37:05.920
 that they would enjoy, positivity gone.

1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:12.520
 They can have a profound negative internal state, psychic pain, and these things can

1:37:12.520 --> 1:37:18.120
 seem and in the severe cases are inescapable.

1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:19.760
 So what is going on?

1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:23.600
 Why is this state part of the human existence?

1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:26.960
 It's got a strong biological genetic link.

1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:28.120
 We know that.

1:37:28.120 --> 1:37:34.600
 It's been linked to certain genes, certain regions of the chromosomes, and twin studies.

1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:36.440
 There's a clear genetic link.

1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:39.520
 It doesn't explain everything, but it's a big part of it.

1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:47.280
 Sex are a strong contributor, and although you can have depression without anything terrible

1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:55.960
 going on in your life, the symptoms can be made worse by stressors, by trauma.

1:37:55.960 --> 1:38:01.080
 But at a very deep level, there's nothing we can measure in a person objectively, so

1:38:01.080 --> 1:38:07.200
 we don't have, there's not a known chemical, not a known structure that's different, not

1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:10.320
 a known brain activity pattern that we can pick up with EEG.

1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:14.320
 A lot of people are exploring this, but right now we have no objective measures.

1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:18.360
 All we do is talk to people and we elicit these symptoms.

1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:25.480
 We explore them, distinguish them from other possible causes, and then what do we do?

1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:27.440
 Well we have a range of treatments.

1:38:27.440 --> 1:38:33.520
 We have medications that can help people, do help people, but not everybody.

1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:37.400
 And if they don't work, then we can go to brain stimulation methods, we can do things

1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:44.600
 even like electroconvulsive therapy, which is very effective, but it's sort of the final

1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:47.480
 thing we go to in the end.

1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:53.680
 And so we have treatments, they work for some people, they don't do everything we'd like,

1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:59.120
 but here's the problem is at a very deep level, we don't understand really what's going on

1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:00.120
 in the brain.

1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:02.360
 We don't have a physical interpretation of the problem.

1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:09.480
 We have all these symptoms, but we can't yet point to a set of cells or a set of circuits

1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:14.040
 or an activity pattern that is causing major depression, this disease state per se in human

1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:15.040
 beings.

1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:21.080
 Why do you think you can't yet, from an optogenetics perspective, is it because there's so many

1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:25.000
 possible causes, is it so much, so many things involved?

1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:29.040
 So I think the answer is there are many things involved and all these different symptoms that

1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:34.880
 I've mentioned, those we can study and those we can fix, the individual symptoms.

1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:37.280
 And we can do this in animals to be clear.

1:39:37.280 --> 1:39:45.560
 So in a mouse, for example, we can instantaneously and precisely turn up or down the motivation

1:39:45.560 --> 1:39:52.000
 of an animal to overcome a challenge, we can turn up or down its ability to be motivated

1:39:52.000 --> 1:40:00.960
 by or we think experience reward from situations or actions, we can increase its apparent energy

1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:10.560
 level, its drive to meet challenges, we can turn up or down social interaction, all these

1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:17.120
 individual features of depression, individual symptoms, we now can point to exact projections

1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:20.840
 and cells that are causal in mediating these.

1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:27.440
 What we don't know is why all these different symptoms show up together in major depression

1:40:27.440 --> 1:40:30.760
 in the human disease syndrome and that's the mystery.

1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:35.480
 It's sort of in other fields of medicine, someone with congestive heart failure who

1:40:35.480 --> 1:40:38.080
 comes into the clinic, they have very different symptoms.

1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:44.360
 They have shortness of breath and they have swollen feet, couldn't be two more different

1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:50.000
 across the body sets of symptoms, neither one obviously related to the heart, but they're

1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:53.400
 both happening because the heart is not working as a pump.

1:40:53.400 --> 1:41:00.720
 And now, thankfully in cardiology, we understand these disparate symptoms that seem totally

1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:06.720
 unrelated can be completely understood because there's an altered pump action of the heart.

1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:13.720
 That's what we are hoping for in psychiatry and in the study of depression or any disease.

1:41:13.720 --> 1:41:21.680
 These different symptoms, the inability to enjoy things, the hopelessness, what's the

1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:22.680
 unifying principle?

1:41:22.680 --> 1:41:23.680
 Yeah, unifying.

1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:28.920
 I mean, is there some truth to that, the Tolstoy quote, that all happy families are alike and

1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:31.800
 each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way?

1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:42.240
 So basically, I mean, this is the human condition and basically the physicists long to find the

1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:45.360
 theory of everything.

1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:52.280
 Isn't understanding depression essentially require you to really have the big theory

1:41:52.280 --> 1:41:55.320
 of everything for the human mind?

1:41:55.320 --> 1:42:00.720
 I think we, it would certainly be nice to have that theory though, don't get me wrong.

1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:01.720
 I don't think we need it.

1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:05.640
 The understanding of the surgery, it would be nice.

1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:07.960
 It's also a good question if it's possible.

1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:08.960
 Yeah.

1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:12.320
 So that I have some thoughts on too.

1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:16.320
 But to this specific question, I don't think we need a theory of everything.

1:42:16.320 --> 1:42:20.480
 I think there will be unifying principles we can get to.

1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:26.480
 But even shy of that, if we can treat symptoms and that's a big step and as you say, different

1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:30.160
 unhappy families are different, different unhappy people are different.

1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:34.560
 If we have somebody who comes to the clinic and I see someone with a profound anhedonia

1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:40.280
 as one of their main symptoms, inability to enjoy things, and if I know based on optogenetics

1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:45.520
 work and animal work that a particular medication can treat anhedonia, even if it doesn't fix

1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:50.560
 major depression in everybody, if I treat that one symptom in that one person, that's

1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:52.040
 a good thing.

1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:58.360
 And so we don't need the theory of everything and we don't even need the unifying principle

1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:01.720
 to help people with insights that come from optogenetics.

1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:09.880
 How much does talking help for diagnosis and for treatment, would you say, for depression?

1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:11.800
 It's a big part of what we do.

1:43:11.800 --> 1:43:17.520
 Every good psychiatrist should be a pretty adept in these verbal communications and

1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:19.960
 talk therapy as part of what they do.

1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:25.080
 I give medications, I deliver brain stimulation treatments, but a big, big part of everything

1:43:25.080 --> 1:43:32.200
 I do with every patient is talk therapy because it works so well together with these other

1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:33.480
 modalities.

1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:40.160
 Even alone, it can help people with moderate or mild depression by itself.

1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:46.320
 People with severe depression, people with other psychiatric illnesses that are severe,

1:43:46.320 --> 1:43:47.880
 you don't want to do talk therapy alone.

1:43:47.880 --> 1:43:52.520
 It's not going to do it, but it still is crucial to do together with the others.

1:43:52.520 --> 1:44:01.840
 And it's critical because it's part of how you reshape cognitions, complex activity patterns,

1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:05.000
 and you won't get to that with a medication or brain stimulation treatment.

1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:12.800
 Do you have advice for people who suffer from mild forms of depression or feel as they might,

1:44:12.800 --> 1:44:19.400
 both for those people and do you have advice for people who love the people who suffer

1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:22.360
 from depression and want to help?

1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:30.100
 One of the incredibly frustrating things about depression is the very nature of it makes

1:44:30.100 --> 1:44:35.960
 it hard for the people who suffer to get treatment because they're hopeless, so they

1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:37.560
 don't think treatment will help.

1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:44.600
 They have low energy, so they're not motivated to participate in treatment in many cases.

1:44:44.600 --> 1:44:48.400
 Sometimes they're actively suicidal, that certainly doesn't help.

1:44:48.400 --> 1:44:54.680
 They have all these things that seem to prevent treatment from being effective.

1:44:54.680 --> 1:44:59.160
 So the loved ones, that's where the loved ones are so important is helping them overcome

1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:05.320
 these barriers to treatment, the motivation, the safety, and the insight.

1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:09.600
 That's critical, and particularly for the severe cases.

1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:15.680
 For the mild cases where people still have some insight and motivation and energy to

1:45:15.680 --> 1:45:17.560
 get something done.

1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:21.480
 There are many things you can do.

1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:26.200
 Exercise is extremely important in mood maintenance.

1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:31.640
 Regulation of sleep and getting sufficient and regular enough sleep is very important.

1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:34.920
 And talk therapy can be helpful in those mild or moderate cases.

1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:42.400
 Just looking at cognitions, looking at patterns of thought that people may have fallen into,

1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:49.240
 where they catastrophize, where they spiral from small things into big things.

1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:55.200
 A little bit of talk therapy, 10, 12 sessions, can help people identify those patterns they

1:45:55.200 --> 1:46:03.000
 may have in themselves that are taking occasional negative thoughts, which everybody has, and

1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:08.360
 magnifying those into more persistent negative states.

1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:12.440
 If you work at this, and it's kind of like homework, this is what we call cognitive behavioral

1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:18.000
 therapy, it's very structured, very organized, you work hard, it requires insight and motivation

1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.520
 and you have to be motivated.

1:46:20.520 --> 1:46:25.200
 But if you are, then you can identify these triggers that send you down particular pathways

1:46:25.200 --> 1:46:27.240
 and work to intercept them.

1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:32.440
 And that is amazingly very effective in mild to moderate cases.

1:46:32.440 --> 1:46:40.520
 So you basically have to train yourself to see the world as a collection of triggers.

1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:49.000
 And you have to first understand, like collect the data, like basically see every experience

1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:54.960
 as a thing that creates a follow on emotion of feeling.

1:46:54.960 --> 1:47:08.240
 And I've learned this on social media, where early on, like all of us, I'll say something,

1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:17.720
 I'll kind of respond to negativity with negativity, and then you observe the results of that.

1:47:17.720 --> 1:47:21.880
 Over time, you think, wait a minute.

1:47:21.880 --> 1:47:27.280
 This thing that I've been doing where when somebody says, you suck and you say, no, you

1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:33.120
 suck, that never produces the results you thought it might.

1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:38.640
 And so I might not want to just don't say you suck back.

1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:41.600
 And I do this through a lot of things in life.

1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:51.520
 I'm very fortunate to not suffer from depression, but I, first of all, I have had and have people

1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:53.520
 in my life who do.

1:47:53.520 --> 1:48:00.840
 And also, all of us have depression, who don't suffer from depression, have depression out.

1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:11.160
 Like it's always knocking on the door, and so you have mild, I mean, if you're very careless

1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:17.760
 with the triggers all around you, then you're just, I think all of us have the capacity

1:48:17.760 --> 1:48:25.400
 to really suffer from that kind of chemical or psychological or philosophical existential

1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:27.680
 crisis.

1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:30.400
 But then it raises a question, why are we built this way?

1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:32.800
 It seems like it doesn't make sense, right?

1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:39.440
 And here's where some of us thinking about where we came from as the human family is

1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:40.880
 kind of interesting.

1:48:40.880 --> 1:48:47.600
 It doesn't make sense that somewhere on that spectrum that it's good to detect that there's

1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:53.760
 an array of adverse forces out there in the world right now at this moment.

1:48:53.760 --> 1:49:02.840
 And to withdraw, to hunker down, to not fight, not strive, not try to meet the challenge,

1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:08.320
 and outweigh these negative forces that are present out there.

1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:11.440
 And that makes a lot of sense.

1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:16.120
 And all animals that have been studied in one form or another show this.

1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:21.860
 Even the worm that I mentioned earlier, C. elegans with 302 neurons, it can effectively

1:49:21.860 --> 1:49:24.160
 give up in challenging situations.

1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:28.520
 We've done this with zebrafish, tiny little transparent fish.

1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:32.360
 You can give them a challenging situation and they will give up.

1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:37.640
 But then if you stimulate a couple very specific brain regions in particular ways, you can

1:49:37.640 --> 1:49:40.560
 motivate them to overcome the challenge.

1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:44.240
 And if you inhibit those regions, they give up much more easily than they would otherwise.

1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:47.320
 You can do this in mice, you can do this in rats.

1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:55.400
 So this is an ancestral conserved pattern to detect that things are pretty bad out there.

1:49:55.400 --> 1:50:00.040
 And to conserve energy, to hunker down, to wait out the storm.

1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:09.400
 So as use, unfortunately, many of our maladies have useful roots in our, that contribute to

1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:15.840
 our survival, so both depression and motivation have uses.

1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:22.240
 Sometimes it's nice to just shut the hell up and huddle with the penguins versus, for

1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:27.440
 some unknown reason, venture out on your own into the mountains like a David Goggins type

1:50:27.440 --> 1:50:28.440
 character.

1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:35.240
 So what's the difference to you between, you see patients between sort of rigorous psychoanalysis.

1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:41.920
 I don't know if you consider what you do, like talk therapy and psychoanalysis.

1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:42.920
 Are they neighbors?

1:50:42.920 --> 1:50:43.920
 Are they overlapping?

1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:46.000
 They're neighbors.

1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:52.040
 Psychoanalysis is, they're relatively, it's not nearly done as much as the talk therapy,

1:50:52.040 --> 1:50:56.960
 like the cognitive behavioral therapy I mentioned.

1:50:56.960 --> 1:51:05.680
 Psychoanalysis is a little more niche now and partly because it's not, data isn't, in

1:51:05.680 --> 1:51:11.200
 terms of actual treatment of actual therapeutic effects, data not as supportive as for cognitive

1:51:11.200 --> 1:51:13.200
 behavioral therapy.

1:51:13.200 --> 1:51:17.800
 But it's still interesting as for insight, people, a lot of people still do it to gain

1:51:17.800 --> 1:51:19.880
 insight into themselves.

1:51:19.880 --> 1:51:24.800
 And in general, it's a good sort of conversation starter, those methods, you know, they're

1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:27.640
 good for getting things out.

1:51:27.640 --> 1:51:32.240
 We don't focus on dreams typically these days in psychiatry, but they're great conversation

1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:33.240
 starters.

1:51:33.240 --> 1:51:38.960
 They're great ways to get things out if people have, and so we like to use those methods

1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:43.000
 just to get the ball rolling sometimes, get people to open up a little bit.

1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:49.320
 But the actual treatment tends not to involve these psychoanalytic approaches where you are

1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:56.920
 really probing the unconscious mind and its manifestation through dreams, for example,

1:51:56.920 --> 1:51:58.200
 as the goal.

1:51:58.200 --> 1:51:59.480
 That's not the goal.

1:51:59.480 --> 1:52:02.800
 Modern talk therapy, we're really focusing on treatment, how to get people to feel better.

1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:08.600
 See, I use that as a conversation opener, the Freudian thing where I try to delve at

1:52:08.600 --> 1:52:15.000
 a bar of the deep sexual desires in a person subconscious, and I find that opens up possibilities

1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:16.000
 very quickly.

1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:22.160
 Now, what's, I mean, this is a silly sounding question, but what's the difference between

1:52:22.160 --> 1:52:26.160
 cognitive behavioral therapy and conversation?

1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:34.160
 So because I personally, as a fan of conversations, as a fan of just, I like listening to podcasts

1:52:34.160 --> 1:52:37.040
 versus like audiobook, I like both, but they're very different.

1:52:37.040 --> 1:52:43.760
 I like conversation, I like, it makes me personally very anxious, so I like to be the listener,

1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:47.960
 like a third wheel, like overhearing a conversation kind of thing.

1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:54.480
 But it's a really powerful method for humans to explore each other's mind, just raw conversation.

1:52:54.480 --> 1:53:01.240
 So do you think it can be more productive to be very systematic about it, or is conversation

1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:06.080
 itself the art form of helping each other, understanding each other and helping each

1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:07.080
 other?

1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:12.400
 There are forms of talk therapy that are essentially conversational, or they much more approach

1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:14.840
 to pure conversation.

1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:18.600
 There are, there's a befriending therapy, there's interpersonal therapy.

1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:25.600
 These are approaches that are purely talk therapy, but they're not as structured as

1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:27.040
 cognitive behavioral therapy.

1:53:27.040 --> 1:53:31.520
 Cognitive behavioral therapy is, there are manuals, there are guidelines, you can almost

1:53:31.520 --> 1:53:35.840
 go through it in a very cookbooky way, there's homework that you get done.

1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:41.440
 So it's, in its fullest form, it's very different from these more conversational strategies.

1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:46.120
 But what's interesting is, sometimes people compare them, and so you'll see almost like

1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:52.560
 randomized controlled studies comparing cognitive behavioral therapy with interpersonal therapy,

1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:53.720
 for example.

1:53:53.720 --> 1:53:59.280
 And they both can work, and actually in some studies they look comparable.

1:53:59.280 --> 1:54:04.640
 So there's, to your point, conversation and insights that come from conversation, if

1:54:04.640 --> 1:54:09.200
 done well, if done artfully, can be as powerful.

1:54:09.200 --> 1:54:13.640
 This reminds me of Robin Williams, so I have to ask you several questions here on that.

1:54:13.640 --> 1:54:18.160
 But one, one of my favorite movies is Goodwill Hunting, I don't know if you've seen it with

1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:19.560
 Robin Williams.

1:54:19.560 --> 1:54:25.720
 So as a psychiatrist yourself, can you do a deep analysis of this other famous psychiatrist,

1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:30.840
 which is the movie character played by Robin Williams at Goodwill Hunting?

1:54:30.840 --> 1:54:37.720
 Is it just a caricature between a psychiatrist and patient relationship, or is there some,

1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:43.320
 something to you that was moving about his ability to connect to this obviously struggling

1:54:43.320 --> 1:54:44.320
 young kid?

1:54:44.320 --> 1:54:50.840
 I think you've hit on the key thing there, which is the depth of the connection.

1:54:50.840 --> 1:55:00.040
 If there's too powerful a connection, that can impair therapy because it could impair

1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:01.280
 open communication.

1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:08.280
 If someone, if a patient has a, sees the role, sees the relationship in a particular way,

1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:16.720
 like in a friendly way, maybe, or like a parental child type way, that can cause problems because

1:55:16.720 --> 1:55:22.840
 then what they choose to share, what they choose to bring up is selected to be appropriate

1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:26.600
 for that view of the relationship.

1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:35.520
 And so I and many other talk therapists actually prefer not to let things get, not let the

1:55:35.520 --> 1:55:37.600
 connection get that deep.

1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:44.400
 You want to have trust, you want to have a therapeutic alliance, we sometimes call it,

1:55:44.400 --> 1:55:52.120
 but it's got to be enough of a blank slate that the patient is not consciously or unconsciously

1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:55.840
 constrained in what they choose to share.

1:55:55.840 --> 1:56:06.960
 And so great movie, great actors, all good, no complaints except realistically the relationship

1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:10.200
 should be a little more arm's length than that.

1:56:10.200 --> 1:56:13.680
 Let's pretend this is real life.

1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:18.360
 Sometimes can't you leave a little bit of yourself in the interaction with the patient?

1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:20.600
 I mean, it's another human being.

1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:21.600
 Yes.

1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:22.600
 So it's a balance.

1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:29.400
 Actually, you do need some of it because let's say this person is having challenges, interpersonal

1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:32.400
 challenges in their life.

1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:40.000
 The best way to notice what those are and to identify them and to work with them is if

1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:48.000
 you can elicit some of those problems in the office, in the therapeutic interaction.

1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:54.840
 And this is really powerful as long as you're alert to it, aware of it, and you don't let

1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:57.040
 it get out of hand.

1:56:57.040 --> 1:57:05.600
 This transference, we call it, is when you transfer in between the current therapeutic

1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:12.120
 relationship and external relationships that the patient may have had with others.

1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:19.320
 And so if the therapist starts to feel an inner feeling like anger, let's say, so let's

1:57:19.320 --> 1:57:26.160
 say you have a patient who is stirring frustration in you or even in extreme cases, anger, the

1:57:26.160 --> 1:57:32.340
 best thing for the therapist to do in that case is to recognize it and to realize that's

1:57:32.340 --> 1:57:36.000
 probably being stirred by other people in the patient's life.

1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.280
 And that could be the source of a lot of problems.

1:57:38.280 --> 1:57:43.800
 And so instead of trying to wall it off and say, oh, I shouldn't be feeling that, I better

1:57:43.800 --> 1:57:49.080
 be a better therapist instead and recognize it and use it and help the patient that way.

1:57:49.080 --> 1:57:53.160
 And so you've got to be a human being, you've got to be a person who feels, you've got to

1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:54.160
 be open.

1:57:54.160 --> 1:57:57.600
 But being controlled and be aware of it.

1:57:57.600 --> 1:58:01.200
 If I may, I just want to read the, because this is my favorite scenes, probably one of

1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:06.840
 the greatest scenes, one of the greatest scenes in movie history because Robin Williams does

1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:10.000
 a single take.

1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.120
 So this is a very interesting interaction between them.

1:58:12.120 --> 1:58:19.280
 So Will, and I'm sure this is a common interaction, maybe with a therapist and a patient, maybe

1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:24.960
 with a father and son, where Will, the young character, they're a young brilliant mathematician

1:58:24.960 --> 1:58:31.680
 and Sean is the therapist, the older therapist where Will looks at a painting that Sean painted

1:58:31.680 --> 1:58:38.200
 and then does a, like a deep critical analysis of the painting that basically, you know,

1:58:38.200 --> 1:58:43.960
 describes, pretending as if he can understand another human being completely by just looking

1:58:43.960 --> 1:58:45.560
 at their painting.

1:58:45.560 --> 1:58:52.480
 And then Sean gives this whole speech that contrasts sort of raw intelligence and the

1:58:52.480 --> 1:58:54.560
 wisdom of experience.

1:58:54.560 --> 1:58:56.920
 And Sean says, single take.

1:58:56.920 --> 1:58:59.680
 He says, you've never been out of Boston, right?

1:58:59.680 --> 1:59:01.360
 And Will says, nope.

1:59:01.360 --> 1:59:04.840
 All this in a sexy Boston accent, by the way.

1:59:04.840 --> 1:59:07.520
 And then Sean gives the speech.

1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:11.840
 If I asked you about art, you'd probably give me this skinny and about every art book

1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:14.400
 I've ever written, Michelangelo.

1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:19.760
 You know a lot about him, life's work, political aspirations, him and the Pope, sexual orientation,

1:59:19.760 --> 1:59:21.480
 the whole works, right?

1:59:21.480 --> 1:59:26.160
 But I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

1:59:26.160 --> 1:59:31.520
 You never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling, seen that.

1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:36.800
 If I asked you about women, you'll probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites.

1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:40.240
 You may have even been laid a few times.

1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:42.000
 The language here is just beautiful.

1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:47.640
 But, but you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman if you're truly

1:59:47.640 --> 1:59:49.240
 happy.

1:59:49.240 --> 1:59:50.240
 You're a tough kid.

1:59:50.240 --> 1:59:54.680
 If I asked you about war, you probably throw shakes bare at me, right?

1:59:54.680 --> 1:59:55.680
 Probably not.

1:59:55.680 --> 2:00:02.320
 Let's say, once more into the breach, dear friends, but you've never been near one.

2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:06.560
 You've never held your best friend's head on your lap and watched him gasp his last

2:00:06.560 --> 2:00:09.400
 breath, looking to you for help.

2:00:09.400 --> 2:00:15.280
 If I asked you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet, but you've never looked

2:00:15.280 --> 2:00:22.120
 at a woman and be truly vulnerable, known someone who can level you with her eyes, feeling

2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:27.720
 like God put an angel on earth just for you, who could rescue you from the depths of hell

2:00:27.720 --> 2:00:32.440
 and you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel.

2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:38.600
 To have that love for her, be there forever, through anything, through cancer, and you

2:00:38.600 --> 2:00:43.080
 wouldn't know about sleeping, sitting up in a hospital room for two months, holding her

2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:47.880
 hand because the doctors could see in your eyes the terms visiting hours don't apply

2:00:47.880 --> 2:00:49.280
 to you.

2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:55.480
 You don't know about real loss because that only occurs when you love something more than

2:00:55.480 --> 2:00:57.800
 you love yourself.

2:00:57.800 --> 2:01:01.800
 I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much.

2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:03.160
 I look at you.

2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:05.640
 I don't see an intelligent, confident man.

2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:10.400
 I see a cocky, scared, shitless kid, but you're a genius, Will.

2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:12.120
 No one denies that.

2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:16.160
 No one can possibly understand the depths of you, but you presume to know everything

2:01:16.160 --> 2:01:21.800
 about me because you saw a painting of mine, you ripped my fucking life apart.

2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:23.880
 You're an orphan, right?

2:01:23.880 --> 2:01:29.000
 Do you think I know the first thing about how hard your life has been, how you feel who

2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:31.800
 you are because I read Oliver Twist?

2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:33.400
 Does that encapsulate you?

2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:37.480
 Personally, I don't give a shit about all that because you know what?

2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:42.400
 I can't learn anything from you that I can't read in some fucking book unless you want

2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:46.520
 to talk about you, who you are, and I'm fascinated.

2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:50.480
 I'm in, but you don't want to do that, do you, sport?

2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:53.840
 You're terrified of what you might say.

2:01:53.840 --> 2:01:55.080
 You're a move, chief.

2:01:55.080 --> 2:01:56.400
 Well done, sir.

2:01:56.400 --> 2:01:57.640
 I know it's a movie.

2:01:57.640 --> 2:01:58.920
 It's interesting, right?

2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:03.280
 So some of that conversation is at some intellectual level, too.

2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:04.480
 It's not just emotional.

2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:11.400
 It's something, it's like, the reason I kind of connect with that is that's a lot of

2:02:11.400 --> 2:02:18.640
 work for therapists, like to really understand another, because he's, I mean, from, okay,

2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:22.960
 I know this is fictional, but just there's calculation happening.

2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:28.960
 He deeply cares to say the words that the other person needs to hear, but also a little

2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:38.600
 bit loses himself in the pride, but then catches himself again, switches from anger to connection.

2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:39.600
 Yeah.

2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:44.080
 So a lot is brought up there, you're right, there has to be some emotion in the therapist

2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:51.640
 to care enough to keep going, to keep probing, to open up as he's doing so, right?

2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:56.840
 He revealed a lot about himself, his own vulnerabilities, but that gave him authenticity.

2:02:56.840 --> 2:03:02.840
 He had to open himself up so that the kid would see the authenticity and open himself

2:03:02.840 --> 2:03:05.240
 up in return.

2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:09.600
 So how do you do that as a psychiatrist, as a therapist?

2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:11.320
 You have to be careful.

2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:17.640
 You don't want to do too much, but opening up a little bit does help.

2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:23.000
 It does create a chance, you're offering up something and that helps the patient come

2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:28.800
 back in return, and it gives you that believability and authenticity.

2:03:28.800 --> 2:03:31.440
 Do you pay the price for that, for opening it up?

2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:32.440
 You can.

2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:39.040
 Yeah, you have a family, you have an incredibly difficult research, you're doing a lot of

2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:40.040
 things in your world.

2:03:40.040 --> 2:03:43.160
 I mean, it's the price you pay for like.

2:03:43.160 --> 2:03:44.160
 Yeah.

2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:50.440
 Well, this is one of the terrifying things about writing the book was, I do open up in

2:03:50.440 --> 2:03:54.960
 a little bit about my own personal life, my own personal challenges, and that was a considered

2:03:54.960 --> 2:04:03.760
 decision because I could have done the patient work and the science work and the history

2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:11.960
 of the human family work and tied it all together, but it wasn't, in an early draft,

2:04:11.960 --> 2:04:16.720
 it was like that, but it wasn't real yet.

2:04:16.720 --> 2:04:21.040
 It wasn't something that everybody could connect with, and I realized, look, if I'm

2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:29.880
 going to do this, I've got to open up myself, and then people can connect with me and see

2:04:29.880 --> 2:04:36.440
 what I'm really saying, and so I did, and that was not something that I'd gone in planning

2:04:36.440 --> 2:04:37.440
 to do.

2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:39.360
 In retrospect, I learned a lot about myself.

2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:44.960
 It was actually really, I think, a good thing that I did, but it was scary.

2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:51.440
 Where are the darkest places you've ever gone in your life?

2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:57.840
 I had things haven't always been easy personally or professionally.

2:04:57.840 --> 2:05:04.000
 I had moments, I was effectively a single dad for a while, a number of years, and these

2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:09.520
 came at probably the hardest, also, professional lifetimes for me, too.

2:05:09.520 --> 2:05:16.760
 The absolute hardest days of late medical school internship, taking a call, getting

2:05:16.760 --> 2:05:25.160
 up at 3 a.m., surgery, medicine, rounds, unforgiving environments, and then all the

2:05:25.160 --> 2:05:32.680
 while, personal life stripped down to the bare, and these were low moments, and then

2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:41.240
 I was hit particularly hard by just experiences on the clinical ward, connecting to deeply

2:05:41.240 --> 2:05:49.680
 with patients, like a child with a brain tumor, and feeling it too strongly, and those things,

2:05:49.680 --> 2:05:54.080
 when you get down to those lowest of the low moments when everything is stripped away,

2:05:54.080 --> 2:06:00.360
 and there's only this raw core, well, that's pretty hard.

2:06:00.360 --> 2:06:04.840
 That was probably the lowest moment, and you learn a lot about yourself in those moments,

2:06:04.840 --> 2:06:14.400
 what's left, and then what are the roots out from there, and that can be powerful to see

2:06:14.400 --> 2:06:15.400
 in yourself.

2:06:15.400 --> 2:06:18.800
 Have you thought about killing yourself?

2:06:18.800 --> 2:06:19.800
 I have not.

2:06:19.800 --> 2:06:25.160
 Have you seen that thought in the distance?

2:06:25.160 --> 2:06:30.320
 I am fortunate that that has not come to my mind, and I have not seen it.

2:06:30.320 --> 2:06:33.440
 Even in the distance.

2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:40.200
 In some ways, I've wondered if that's made me, am I a less effective psychiatrist because

2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:42.200
 of that?

2:06:42.200 --> 2:06:44.040
 I've felt everything stripped away.

2:06:44.040 --> 2:06:48.360
 I've been at the lowest of the low, and yet that can't...

2:06:48.360 --> 2:06:52.560
 There's a light of hope still at the end of the tunnel.

2:06:52.560 --> 2:06:55.560
 You never lost, even for brief moments, that...

2:06:55.560 --> 2:06:56.560
 Never did.

2:06:56.560 --> 2:06:57.560
 I don't know why.

2:06:57.560 --> 2:06:58.560
 You don't know why.

2:06:58.560 --> 2:07:00.560
 You don't know why.

2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:01.560
 There was no reason to...

2:07:01.560 --> 2:07:02.560
 You don't know why.

2:07:02.560 --> 2:07:05.840
 No reason to feel hope at that moment, honestly.

2:07:05.840 --> 2:07:08.440
 So it was just a light without reason.

2:07:08.440 --> 2:07:11.120
 Yeah, that's right.

2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:15.440
 What wisdom do you draw from that time?

2:07:15.440 --> 2:07:16.440
 About...

2:07:16.440 --> 2:07:21.560
 So first of all, you said something funny, which is, I wonder if it...

2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:30.360
 That it's somehow not having thoughts of suicide limits your capacity to truly understand

2:07:30.360 --> 2:07:34.880
 somebody who is having those thoughts.

2:07:34.880 --> 2:07:43.000
 So how many demons must the psychiatrist have in order to be a good psychiatrist?

2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:45.400
 You know, this is a really interesting question.

2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:51.080
 I think everybody knows, and I can say this, that psychiatrists can be a little unusual.

2:07:51.080 --> 2:07:53.720
 We think about ourselves, right?

2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:54.880
 We think about our brains.

2:07:54.880 --> 2:07:58.800
 That may be one reason why we become psychiatrists is we think, oh, that's interesting going

2:07:58.800 --> 2:07:59.800
 on in there.

2:07:59.800 --> 2:08:00.800
 What's that about?

2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:04.040
 So a little introspective, a little introverted, maybe.

2:08:04.040 --> 2:08:08.760
 And that's what can make us good when we're good.

2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:14.840
 But also that may select for people who have some unusual aspects.

2:08:14.840 --> 2:08:17.240
 But you don't have to have all of them.

2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:21.040
 There's a lot that can go wrong in the psychiatric realm.

2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:26.200
 I think having some of those, some of it, but not all of it is enough.

2:08:26.200 --> 2:08:29.920
 You get to see how low things can get.

2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:38.600
 You can get empathy from that, even if the symptoms are not the same.

2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:41.160
 Just empathy for struggle, for suffering.

2:08:41.160 --> 2:08:42.160
 That's right.

2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:43.160
 That's right.

2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:49.480
 You yourself have to practice observing triggers just as a human operating in this world.

2:08:49.480 --> 2:08:56.000
 I've definitely, those skills that have come from therapy, I've found them useful.

2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:01.160
 If I noticed that, we've all been through experiences where we wonder, oh, I got really

2:09:01.160 --> 2:09:03.560
 mad in that interaction.

2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:05.040
 Why did I get that mad?

2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:09.400
 Yeah, sure, maybe I could have been irritated, but man, why did I?

2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:18.880
 And then thinking about it and realizing, OK, back up here, think about the broader context.

2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:23.520
 Think about how that relates to prior events in my life.

2:09:23.520 --> 2:09:24.520
 OK, yeah.

2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:30.280
 So this is a thing for me when something of this class happens, then it triggers me.

2:09:30.280 --> 2:09:34.120
 So going forward, I'm going to be aware of that.

2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:40.520
 And I've definitely used that because you don't want to be out of control of those emotions.

2:09:40.520 --> 2:09:41.520
 You want to identify them.

2:09:41.520 --> 2:09:46.720
 You want to know where they come from and you want to head them off as a civilized human

2:09:46.720 --> 2:09:50.200
 being living on this earth, trying to get along with other people.

2:09:50.200 --> 2:09:52.040
 You want to understand those moments.

2:09:52.040 --> 2:10:01.240
 Let me return to Robin Williams for a second and looking at Robin Williams, the actor, sorry,

2:10:01.240 --> 2:10:02.240
 the human.

2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:07.800
 And because you mentioned for depression, you can have everything going well.

2:10:07.800 --> 2:10:13.920
 And I think there's just famous cases of just public figures because a lot of people know

2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:19.840
 them where they suffer quietly.

2:10:19.840 --> 2:10:24.960
 And it seems like from the outside perspective that they have everything going for them,

2:10:24.960 --> 2:10:26.560
 that they're at the top of their career.

2:10:26.560 --> 2:10:32.440
 Two people that come to mind are Robin Williams and Anthony Bourdain.

2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:40.080
 What insight do you have in why either of those have taken, why Robin Williams, a comedian,

2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:45.720
 one of the most jolly humans, obviously there's always the darkness that he was channeling

2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:50.440
 in order to present the happiness.

2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:56.240
 But it feels like that realness is only possible when you're deeply self honest and analytical

2:10:56.240 --> 2:10:57.240
 on.

2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:01.320
 And then if you're deeply self honest, you're going to realize that there's a lot of beautiful

2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:03.800
 things about life that you can discover.

2:11:03.800 --> 2:11:07.440
 And if you do that, how can you possibly then take your own life?

2:11:07.440 --> 2:11:10.480
 I mean, you go through all of these thoughts.

2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:17.320
 And I think a lot of people really loved Robin Williams, which is why it was really difficult

2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:22.360
 to see how can even him, how can even Robin Williams take his own life?

2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:26.520
 So I don't know if there's something to be said about the nature of depression from just

2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:29.120
 looking at his case.

2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:33.500
 I think the action of suicide is not well understood.

2:11:33.500 --> 2:11:37.800
 It doesn't always, although often is correlated with depression.

2:11:37.800 --> 2:11:42.920
 There are cases of suicide where there is not clear depression, that's in the minority.

2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:47.840
 By the way, if I just, because you said it's so interesting, action of suicide, because

2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:49.960
 there's also thoughts of suicide.

2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:57.320
 They're probably those, they're probably somewhat understood, but it's an interesting, because

2:11:57.320 --> 2:11:59.400
 you can think of suicide.

2:11:59.400 --> 2:12:06.440
 If you have suicidal ideation, you can think of that for so many reasons.

2:12:06.440 --> 2:12:19.240
 And the, I mean, thoughts sometimes like painful thoughts, angry thoughts or thoughts in general

2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:24.520
 can be very different like fantasies, for example, you can fantasize like sexual fantasies.

2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:30.200
 You can fantasize I was just for humor's sake, wanted to mention stuff, but then people think

2:12:30.200 --> 2:12:31.200
 I'm serious.

2:12:31.200 --> 2:12:34.160
 I'm not going to mention anything, but sexual fantasies.

2:12:34.160 --> 2:12:36.840
 And then there's, I know there's people that have sexual fantasies and they don't want

2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:42.160
 to actually do that in real life, that sexual fantasies serve some kind of purpose in imagination

2:12:42.160 --> 2:12:43.160
 only.

2:12:43.160 --> 2:12:47.560
 And in that same way, suicide might serve a purpose in imagination only is very unlikely

2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:48.560
 to lead to action.

2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:54.280
 And yet there's other thoughts that maybe are more amorphous that do lead to action.

2:12:54.280 --> 2:12:58.480
 And that leap, yeah, that, oh boy, that's a facet.

2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:03.760
 And that's such a philosophically powerful thought to not exist.

2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:11.040
 Like that question, that's this, is it Sarcher or Camus, Camus, or the mythosophist Camus,

2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:14.560
 who says like basic question of why live.

2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:16.560
 It's a good question.

2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:17.560
 Yeah.

2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:18.560
 Yeah.

2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:21.000
 So that's a great question, actually.

2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:23.000
 And there are other related questions.

2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:31.880
 Some people may have the thought of suicide because there seems no point.

2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:33.320
 There's no joy in life.

2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:37.080
 That's one reason that some people can put forward.

2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:39.960
 Sometimes there's an, it's not just the absence of joy.

2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:44.200
 There's an active pain, an active psychic pain in some people.

2:13:44.200 --> 2:13:50.640
 And that, the inescapability of that is enough to drive the thoughts of suicide.

2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:56.320
 And then there are interpersonal and cultural reasons as well that can show up.

2:13:56.320 --> 2:14:01.760
 But the act, this act of ending of the self is, in all these cases, there's no real way

2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:07.920
 to study this in animals, no other animal as far as we know that we can study has this

2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:10.840
 concept of this is myself.

2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:15.480
 The situation is not tolerable, therefore I will end the self.

2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:18.800
 To our knowledge, this is not something that can be studied in other animals.

2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:26.600
 So it remains this very poorly understood action.

2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:29.880
 And in predicting it, so what do we do as psychiatrists?

2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:33.920
 We have this challenge, people come to the emergency room, they say they're suicidal

2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:40.320
 or their friends say they're suicidal or they've taken some action that didn't lead to death.

2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:41.320
 What do we do?

2:14:41.320 --> 2:14:44.240
 Well, there's a whole range of options.

2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:50.400
 Was it a suicidal gesture in the sense of not intending death or was it was the intent

2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:51.400
 death?

2:14:51.400 --> 2:14:55.520
 And if it was the intent was death, what were the reasons, are the reasons transient, are

2:14:55.520 --> 2:14:57.160
 they gone now?

2:14:57.160 --> 2:15:00.280
 What's the probability that it'll be repeated?

2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:04.400
 So we do all these things just to decide what sort of treatment should be carried out.

2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:11.480
 But nowhere is there a deep understanding of the biology of the cells and circuits and

2:15:11.480 --> 2:15:16.960
 activity patterns that underlie the action to end the self.

2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:21.840
 It's a very, it's this frustrating thing.

2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:28.360
 It's so timely, it's so common, it shows up in veterans, it shows up in kids, it shows

2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:35.600
 up in people at every stage of life and yet we're very bad at understanding it and we're

2:15:35.600 --> 2:15:40.800
 relatively poor at predicting it and our tools are not very powerful.

2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:44.960
 We can put people in a locked unit, we can give them care or therapy for a while.

2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:48.760
 At some point, we release them and there's only so much we can do.

2:15:48.760 --> 2:15:53.720
 It's one of the most frustrating things and the suffering that is linked to suicidality.

2:15:53.720 --> 2:15:58.800
 But it is a decision and it is an action and if you look at optogenetics, you should be

2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:05.480
 able to one day sort of understand the dynamics of such weighty decisions.

2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:10.440
 The individual causes then, if someone is anhedonic, if there is no joy in life, that

2:16:10.440 --> 2:16:12.800
 very likely is addressable by optogenetics.

2:16:12.800 --> 2:16:17.840
 We know how to turn that dial very robustly in animals.

2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:26.120
 The motivation to overcome challenges, that we have some hope of understanding.

2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:30.440
 Psychic pain, internal negative states, we have actually a handle on that as well.

2:16:30.440 --> 2:16:34.400
 There's a structure in the brain called the habenula and some linked structures around

2:16:34.400 --> 2:16:39.240
 it that seems to generate this negative internal state.

2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:47.400
 It's active when a state of acute disappointment, acute outcomes that go wrong, not as expected.

2:16:47.400 --> 2:16:52.880
 There are moments of unexpected pain.

2:16:52.880 --> 2:17:01.280
 Habenula is there, it seems, it's active to report on internal negativity with its action.

2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:05.800
 You could imagine strategies to target this brain structure that might have the effect

2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:10.000
 of reducing psychic pain, reducing the negativity of internal states.

2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.160
 That is a very concrete hope.

2:17:12.160 --> 2:17:13.160
 It's precise.

2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:14.160
 It's anatomical.

2:17:14.160 --> 2:17:19.880
 Optogenetics has given us all the firm foundation we need to go after that question.

2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:21.520
 I think there is hope.

2:17:21.520 --> 2:17:26.120
 If you look at the individual causes, the individual symptoms relating to suicide, and

2:17:26.120 --> 2:17:29.360
 then it's like a puzzle, you put together the puzzle pieces.

2:17:29.360 --> 2:17:38.600
 By the way, I do think my habenula is very functioning very actively.

2:17:38.600 --> 2:17:43.680
 I wonder if it's like, because you can also learn to channel these things.

2:17:43.680 --> 2:17:53.280
 One of the things we suffer from, there's degrees of suffering, can be a source of progress

2:17:53.280 --> 2:18:00.560
 and personal growth and development and all those kinds of things.

2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:01.560
 What is it?

2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:07.280
 Nietzsche suffered from stomach issues.

2:18:07.280 --> 2:18:13.360
 I wonder if he's written some of those things, if his stomach was all great.

2:18:13.360 --> 2:18:21.280
 Whereas I kind of think that a difficult life in some form, you get to choose in some

2:18:21.280 --> 2:18:25.720
 regard and some you don't, the difficulties you have and the ones you do have, it's nice

2:18:25.720 --> 2:18:27.840
 to use if possible.

2:18:27.840 --> 2:18:31.040
 Sometimes it's nice to treat, sometimes it's nice to use.

2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:33.560
 Well, the way you phrase it, I think you're using it.

2:18:33.560 --> 2:18:39.280
 I could be wrong, but if you phrase it in this semi humorous way about your habenula,

2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:44.840
 it seems to me that you're using that to good effect.

2:18:44.840 --> 2:18:48.200
 But one never really knows what someone else's internal state is.

2:18:48.200 --> 2:18:52.720
 As I look at you, I don't know the depths of what's going on.

2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:57.800
 It's possible that it's a much harder situation in there.

2:18:57.800 --> 2:18:58.800
 Yes.

2:18:58.800 --> 2:19:00.480
 I actually worry about this a lot.

2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:05.680
 So I'm extremely self critical in the privacy of my own mind, which is an interesting thing

2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:11.800
 when you get to meet the internet and the internet will tell you, you suck.

2:19:11.800 --> 2:19:16.920
 But for now, this is what I worry about and I'm very paying attention.

2:19:16.920 --> 2:19:22.680
 For now, it's really, I just have this very negative voice, but that voice seems to be

2:19:22.680 --> 2:19:25.240
 very useful for productivity.

2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:26.280
 So I channel it.

2:19:26.280 --> 2:19:30.000
 I just put it on the table and let that voice talk to me.

2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:37.320
 But I'm very, I'm monitoring that voice because looking at Robin Williams, you get older,

2:19:37.320 --> 2:19:43.680
 your brain changes, and then that voice can now all of a sudden grow.

2:19:43.680 --> 2:19:46.640
 And then where you can't control it as much, you have to be very careful with these kinds

2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:47.640
 of things.

2:19:47.640 --> 2:19:50.320
 So you're very right about that.

2:19:50.320 --> 2:19:56.480
 So my negativity, I have this, I never think I've done enough is sort of where my negativity

2:19:56.480 --> 2:19:58.240
 comes from inside.

2:19:58.240 --> 2:20:08.960
 I never think that I've met the potential of the moment I haven't done, I haven't made

2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:15.880
 the most of the opportunities that are available still early, I haven't progressed as far as

2:20:15.880 --> 2:20:16.880
 I should.

2:20:16.880 --> 2:20:21.040
 And exactly as you're saying, that works for a while.

2:20:21.040 --> 2:20:29.040
 But then what happens as you get later in life, and there's less runway to fix that.

2:20:29.040 --> 2:20:33.120
 And then maybe then that negative voice is a problem.

2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:37.520
 But also at that point, the negative voice starts having more and more of a point.

2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:44.520
 When you're being very successful, it's easy to be like, no, okay, well, like later in

2:20:44.520 --> 2:20:49.760
 life, you're really literally just sitting there on a rocking chair doing nothing.

2:20:49.760 --> 2:20:56.640
 And then it's, or maybe any kind of tragedy happens, loss of a loved one, loss of a job,

2:20:56.640 --> 2:21:02.680
 loss, or you get screwed over in some kind of way, I don't know.

2:21:02.680 --> 2:21:06.760
 And then all of a sudden, the negative voice is just you and the negative voice for days

2:21:06.760 --> 2:21:07.760
 and days and days.

2:21:07.760 --> 2:21:12.200
 And so I don't know, to go back to your example of Robin Williams, I don't know what was going

2:21:12.200 --> 2:21:13.360
 on inside him.

2:21:13.360 --> 2:21:15.520
 I don't know the nature of his internal state.

2:21:15.520 --> 2:21:17.720
 Was it active, psychic pain?

2:21:17.720 --> 2:21:22.960
 May I mention, may I interrupt to just say that Sergei posted an examination of Robin

2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:30.080
 Williams's brain tissue suggested that he suffered from, quote, diffuse L.E.W.Y.,

2:21:30.080 --> 2:21:36.640
 lewey body dementia, L.B.D., a depression is a symptom of L.B.D.

2:21:36.640 --> 2:21:40.560
 And it's not about psychology, it's rooted in urology.

2:21:40.560 --> 2:21:43.720
 This is words from Sergei, his brain was falling apart.

2:21:43.720 --> 2:21:44.720
 Yeah.

2:21:44.720 --> 2:21:50.520
 L.B.D., this is a very interesting neurological disorder where, among other things, there's

2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:51.960
 neuron death indeed.

2:21:51.960 --> 2:21:57.880
 So you've got Frank, neuron loss, it's not just a matter of some longstanding psychic

2:21:57.880 --> 2:22:01.160
 pain, but you've got a progressive loss.

2:22:01.160 --> 2:22:05.640
 And so clearly you've got a situation where he could have finally reached a point where

2:22:05.640 --> 2:22:11.800
 the balance that he'd worked out between negativity and positivity was disrupted due

2:22:11.800 --> 2:22:12.800
 to loss.

2:22:12.800 --> 2:22:17.240
 The cells died, the wrong projections were cut by the lewey body dementia.

2:22:17.240 --> 2:22:19.760
 Certainly dopamine neurons die in lewey body dementia.

2:22:19.760 --> 2:22:24.520
 Those are neurons that give rise to much of the feelings of reward and pleasure that

2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:27.520
 we experience, among other roles.

2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:34.120
 So clearly, in his case, there could have been a very concrete cellular neurological

2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:37.920
 issue that was progressive and pushed him to that point.

2:22:37.920 --> 2:22:43.880
 But were you about to make a point about broader that if there isn't another in your logical

2:22:43.880 --> 2:22:44.880
 degeneration?

2:22:44.880 --> 2:22:45.880
 Yeah.

2:22:45.880 --> 2:22:51.680
 So in his case, not knowing that, it could have been simply that let's say he had an internal

2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:57.640
 psychic pain state and he was in sort of a compensated mode for much of his life, able

2:22:57.640 --> 2:23:02.280
 to generate enough joy from his comedy and his social interactions.

2:23:02.280 --> 2:23:08.240
 And then, but eventually later in life, those things drop away, the balance shifts, you

2:23:08.240 --> 2:23:10.840
 get tired of fighting the pain for that long.

2:23:10.840 --> 2:23:16.000
 And then so you've got this time dependent non stationarity that happens and then the

2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:21.400
 same symptom becomes no longer tolerable in the end.

2:23:21.400 --> 2:23:22.400
 What is autism?

2:23:22.400 --> 2:23:25.640
 What do we know about autism?

2:23:25.640 --> 2:23:32.720
 Human beings exist on a spectrum of how social we can be, and this is pretty interesting

2:23:32.720 --> 2:23:38.320
 actually scientifically, but also very important clinically.

2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:43.840
 There are hyper social states where people are almost too social, there are chromosomal

2:23:43.840 --> 2:23:50.480
 deletion states where people have instant affinity and bonding and rich deep seeming

2:23:50.480 --> 2:23:52.840
 connections with people very verbal.

2:23:52.840 --> 2:24:04.360
 On the other end, people with autism spectrum disorder are not able to keep up with social

2:24:04.360 --> 2:24:06.720
 interactions and it's a spectrum.

2:24:06.720 --> 2:24:14.200
 Some have mild to moderate difficulties, they may have inability to understand what the next

2:24:14.200 --> 2:24:19.920
 thing to do in a social situation is, but may have perfectly good language abilities.

2:24:19.920 --> 2:24:25.080
 And as you progress further along the spectrum, that gets more and more severe so they can't

2:24:25.080 --> 2:24:29.800
 make eye contact because it's too overwhelming to think about what has to be done next if

2:24:29.800 --> 2:24:32.440
 a person looks in a particular way.

2:24:32.440 --> 2:24:37.880
 And then as you go farther than language and social communication themselves break down

2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:43.400
 so there's no reciprocity, there's no shared enjoyment and that this gets very hard then

2:24:43.400 --> 2:24:48.000
 as you get to this far end of the spectrum where there's really an absence of social

2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:52.960
 cognition at all and social bonding.

2:24:52.960 --> 2:24:54.720
 So why does this exist?

2:24:54.720 --> 2:24:55.720
 What is it?

2:24:55.720 --> 2:24:56.720
 It's very genetic.

2:24:56.720 --> 2:25:02.000
 As I mentioned, it's one of the top three or four most biological in a sense of most

2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:05.520
 genetically determined of the psychiatric illnesses.

2:25:05.520 --> 2:25:10.480
 It does have these interesting positive correlations, slight positive correlations with intelligence

2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:14.120
 and education.

2:25:14.120 --> 2:25:18.400
 And the reason for that is kind of interesting to think about.

2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:22.960
 Is there something good about it just like or at least with at least part of the spectrum

2:25:22.960 --> 2:25:26.400
 is there's something good about it just as we were talking about for depression as you

2:25:26.400 --> 2:25:30.920
 could say for mania, as you could say for schizophrenia.

2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:38.280
 And here it's kind of interesting to think about the underlying science of what it means

2:25:38.280 --> 2:25:42.120
 to be good at a social interaction.

2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:46.480
 And it was very good and a social interaction is incredibly good at dealing with unpredictable

2:25:46.480 --> 2:25:48.480
 information.

2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:56.600
 Is able to handle this torrent of information coming through rapidly changing model of the

2:25:56.600 --> 2:26:02.760
 other person and of the interaction and their model of you, your model of them with each

2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:07.040
 word that changes with each new bit of information that comes in through the conversation, each

2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:12.320
 bit of body language, all this is rapidly changing and some people are able to keep up

2:26:12.320 --> 2:26:15.720
 with that fire hose information perfectly well.

2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:17.440
 But that's a special brain state to be in.

2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:23.520
 That's working with unpredictability.

2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:29.560
 The only way that can be done is most likely by constantly running models of what the other

2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:31.640
 person might be about to say.

2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:34.480
 So you can't stop and think, oh, what did that word mean?

2:26:34.480 --> 2:26:37.760
 What did that shift in eye contact mean?

2:26:37.760 --> 2:26:38.920
 What do they mean together?

2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:42.480
 There has to be some advanced work going on where you're predicting what's going on if

2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:46.720
 you're to keep up with a rich and fast social interaction.

2:26:46.720 --> 2:26:53.720
 Now on the flip side, there are brain states that maybe don't have to work so fast that

2:26:53.720 --> 2:26:58.600
 are extremely important still dealing with something that's not moving or that's predictable,

2:26:58.600 --> 2:27:07.400
 still complex like mathematical proof or a very complex arrangement of geometrical shapes,

2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:11.240
 a large number of individual nonmoving things.

2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:16.440
 There's possibly a way of being that's particularly good at dealing with these static, unmoving

2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:23.040
 or predictable situations and less so with these rapidly changing social situations.

2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:31.120
 And so the way I conceptualize autism is these are people whose brains are not so good with

2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:38.160
 a high bit rate, unpredictable information, but maybe quite good at giving enough time,

2:27:38.160 --> 2:27:48.040
 given the grace to work with the system to look at it from different angles, to take

2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:54.160
 different perspectives with a confidence that it's not changing in between perspectives.

2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:55.800
 That's a brain state that's valuable.

2:27:55.800 --> 2:28:01.200
 It's something that has probably contributed to a lot of the success of the human family,

2:28:01.200 --> 2:28:09.040
 being able to design something, being able to consider all the different contributions

2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:13.360
 to a static predictable system.

2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:21.760
 So autism in a sense is a spectrum that has identifiable characteristics about the way

2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:29.160
 people deal with dynamic information, often express itself as like social dynamic information.

2:28:29.160 --> 2:28:33.360
 But you critically, your use of the word often there is really, I think smart because it's

2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:37.320
 not just social interaction that is a challenge in autism.

2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:44.960
 And so many people conceptualize it purely as a social dysfunction disorder.

2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:50.200
 But it's really any unpredictable information that's a problem, that's a challenge for people

2:28:50.200 --> 2:28:51.200
 on the spectrum.

2:28:51.200 --> 2:28:58.600
 They react very negatively to unexpected sounds, even if not social sounds, unexpected

2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:01.480
 lights, unexpected touches.

2:29:01.480 --> 2:29:06.960
 And so it's really unpredictable information that is in my view the core problem with the

2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:09.520
 processing in autism, not just social.

2:29:09.520 --> 2:29:11.480
 Social just shows up because it's so unpredictable.

2:29:11.480 --> 2:29:12.480
 Yeah.

2:29:12.480 --> 2:29:13.480
 It's so interesting.

2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:19.320
 I mean, I tried to not to think about that stuff.

2:29:19.320 --> 2:29:25.120
 I'm afraid of thinking about disorders and things like that because just like I don't

2:29:25.120 --> 2:29:32.800
 like sort of economics or game theory, I wouldn't be careful with it because whenever you have

2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:39.280
 a category or a model, it's too easy to just for every, I mean, it's the OCD thing.

2:29:39.280 --> 2:29:40.800
 I like models too much.

2:29:40.800 --> 2:29:42.240
 I like categories too much.

2:29:42.240 --> 2:29:46.360
 The moment you acknowledge yourself, well, I have an eating disorder, for example, or

2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:51.000
 something like that, as opposed to just being a, well, I'll just, I'll just leave it at

2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:54.600
 that for my own critical understanding of myself.

2:29:54.600 --> 2:29:57.120
 Let's just say I don't know how to moderate eating fruit.

2:29:57.120 --> 2:29:58.120
 People make fun of me.

2:29:58.120 --> 2:30:00.720
 They think all fruit is, fruit is healthy.

2:30:00.720 --> 2:30:08.040
 I know, I don't, well, I don't know how to moderate anything, but even fruit, this apples

2:30:08.040 --> 2:30:10.040
 and cherries is a nightmare.

2:30:10.040 --> 2:30:11.040
 Interesting.

2:30:11.040 --> 2:30:19.520
 Anyway, that's such a psychiatrist thing to say, very interesting, but there's characteristics

2:30:19.520 --> 2:30:26.760
 and it's interesting to think about, like for example, I have trouble making eye contact,

2:30:26.760 --> 2:30:35.360
 but I actually, as you said it now, it's not that I'm shy at all in that sense.

2:30:35.360 --> 2:30:41.560
 It's literally, I'm getting way too much information is distracting me, like I need to just close

2:30:41.560 --> 2:30:48.000
 my eyes so I can, like all the things that people seem to be able to do in parallel.

2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:53.280
 It's just, you just asked me a question for me to think about the answer to that question.

2:30:53.280 --> 2:30:57.400
 I can't have all this cool, rich visual information coming my way.

2:30:57.400 --> 2:31:03.080
 That's literally, because I often close my eyes to think it's not because I'm afraid

2:31:03.080 --> 2:31:06.440
 of something, whatever, it's just like too much information happening here.

2:31:06.440 --> 2:31:07.440
 Yeah.

2:31:07.440 --> 2:31:09.280
 Well, that's a beautiful description.

2:31:09.280 --> 2:31:15.640
 It's amazing that that is how you experience the eye contact aspect.

2:31:15.640 --> 2:31:22.720
 I think that's, I mean, you've articulated what captures it for so many people, which

2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:23.840
 is that it's overwhelming.

2:31:23.840 --> 2:31:30.800
 There's just too much information just coming in through the eyes and to keep up with it,

2:31:30.800 --> 2:31:34.720
 to know you're going to be expected to keep up with it, first of all, so there's that

2:31:34.720 --> 2:31:35.720
 aspect.

2:31:35.720 --> 2:31:39.360
 You know, you learned socially that there's going to be an expectation if you're making

2:31:39.360 --> 2:31:44.840
 eye contact, people are going to think you're keeping up with it and you don't want to because

2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:49.280
 you want to focus on other things and make progress in other dimensions.

2:31:49.280 --> 2:31:56.240
 Yeah, and so then there's a strong desire to look away or to close the eyes because it's

2:31:56.240 --> 2:32:00.240
 overwhelming, it's a distraction, and it's going to cause errors of understanding.

2:32:00.240 --> 2:32:04.480
 And of course, our eyes, that's part, the way we use our eyes as part of the human communication

2:32:04.480 --> 2:32:10.680
 is to have to kind of be aware of that element of it.

2:32:10.680 --> 2:32:12.240
 So yeah, I mean, but it's fascinating.

2:32:12.240 --> 2:32:18.720
 You should be aware of your own self and those little characteristics, whether it's classified

2:32:18.720 --> 2:32:24.440
 on some aspect of the autism spectrum, or just in general, whether it's eating, whether

2:32:24.440 --> 2:32:30.960
 it's depression, whether it's even like schizophrenia that would, I hope we get a chance to talk

2:32:30.960 --> 2:32:40.040
 to a little bit, yeah, but those things are all made up of different symptoms and characteristics

2:32:40.040 --> 2:32:47.040
 and use them as a superpower, I suppose, is the best we can hope for in mild cases, I

2:32:47.040 --> 2:32:48.040
 guess.

2:32:48.040 --> 2:32:51.040
 And I do think both brain states can't coexist at the same time.

2:32:51.040 --> 2:32:55.320
 The way of dealing with something unpredictable and dealing with something predictable, those

2:32:55.320 --> 2:33:02.440
 are different ways of being, here's a huge opportunity for very creative model building

2:33:02.440 --> 2:33:08.240
 in theoretical neuroscience and linking that to these data streams we're getting across

2:33:08.240 --> 2:33:15.880
 the brain that we talked about earlier, these immense data sets of activity across the brain.

2:33:15.880 --> 2:33:19.760
 Here's where I think there could be a real convergence of theoreticians and experimentalists

2:33:19.760 --> 2:33:27.040
 to say, okay, given what we know about wiring of the brain, here is what the brain state

2:33:27.040 --> 2:33:31.880
 is likely to be that deals well with unpredictable information, and here's the brain state that

2:33:31.880 --> 2:33:35.640
 deals with predictable information, here's why they're incompatible at least at the same

2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:40.320
 time, here's why you've got to be able to detect which state you should be in, here's

2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:44.880
 how you could switch between them, here's the kind of cells that you would predict almost

2:33:44.880 --> 2:33:49.840
 like predicting the Higgs boson, here's the kind of circuitry that I would predict should

2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:58.560
 govern the switching or might make one state too sticky, too hard to get out of.

2:33:58.560 --> 2:34:03.680
 That is a huge opportunity for an interaction from the theoretical and experimental side

2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:04.680
 together.

2:34:04.680 --> 2:34:13.560
 Make one state too sticky, sort of measure the stickiness of the state and how to lessen

2:34:13.560 --> 2:34:16.720
 the stickiness, get some oil in the machine.

2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:17.720
 Yes.

2:34:17.720 --> 2:34:22.480
 What would predict the kind of oil that would work well?

2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:31.480
 What in your practice is treatment or advice for people on the autism spectrum?

2:34:31.480 --> 2:34:34.560
 So right now there's no real medical treatment.

2:34:34.560 --> 2:34:38.960
 There are behavioral treatments that are most effective early in life.

2:34:38.960 --> 2:34:42.240
 They make sure people don't fall too far behind.

2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:47.800
 If you're not interacting socially, you create this vicious cycle where you fall farther

2:34:47.800 --> 2:34:51.600
 and farther behind because you're not interacting and these therapies which are applied early

2:34:51.600 --> 2:34:58.240
 in life, therapists work with the kids, train them to deal with these things that otherwise

2:34:58.240 --> 2:35:03.720
 would be aversive to them, teach them how to predict things and interact and that has

2:35:03.720 --> 2:35:06.920
 a big effect, but it's behavioral therapy.

2:35:06.920 --> 2:35:08.920
 There's no medicine that works.

2:35:08.920 --> 2:35:13.920
 There are ways of reducing individual symptoms though that sometimes come along with autism

2:35:13.920 --> 2:35:15.840
 and those do respond to medications.

2:35:15.840 --> 2:35:23.760
 So one thing very often my patients with autism are very anxious because they live in a world

2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:28.520
 that they have a really hard time predicting what's going to happen and some of these are

2:35:28.520 --> 2:35:34.920
 high functioning, Silicon Valley types who they may make great livings but they're very

2:35:34.920 --> 2:35:38.200
 unhappy because they're on the spectrum.

2:35:38.200 --> 2:35:43.320
 They don't understand how social interactions really work.

2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:47.280
 They're very anxiety provoking because they don't know what to say.

2:35:47.280 --> 2:35:51.040
 They don't have any clue how anybody else knows what to say.

2:35:51.040 --> 2:35:52.040
 They're constantly worried.

2:35:52.040 --> 2:35:55.680
 They're going to say something that's completely inappropriate and so they're very anxious and

2:35:55.680 --> 2:35:57.440
 I can treat their anxiety.

2:35:57.440 --> 2:36:02.640
 It doesn't touch the autism per se but I can help them with their anxiety.

2:36:02.640 --> 2:36:05.200
 What I just talked about eye contact.

2:36:05.200 --> 2:36:11.160
 I am richly, even with the eyes closed and all those kinds of things, I'm richly experiencing

2:36:11.160 --> 2:36:15.320
 the world and it's not like you're afraid of the world or you're not able, I don't

2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:16.320
 know what to do.

2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:17.320
 No, I know everything.

2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:19.240
 In fact, I know way too much.

2:36:19.240 --> 2:36:20.600
 There's so many cool options.

2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:26.640
 Like at any one moment there's all the stuff happening and it's all beautiful and in any

2:36:26.640 --> 2:36:28.680
 one moment you can do anything you want.

2:36:28.680 --> 2:36:29.880
 You can take off your clothes.

2:36:29.880 --> 2:36:31.840
 You can punch that guy over there.

2:36:31.840 --> 2:36:33.960
 You can run away.

2:36:33.960 --> 2:36:35.920
 You can go in for a hug.

2:36:35.920 --> 2:36:40.320
 You can say something profound and deep or you can say something generic or you could

2:36:40.320 --> 2:36:46.560
 use so many things you can say and then it'll unravel in all these kinds of ways and this

2:36:46.560 --> 2:36:51.600
 moment could be completely life changing or it can be mundane and meaningless and all

2:36:51.600 --> 2:36:56.080
 of those options are before you at any one moment.

2:36:56.080 --> 2:37:02.240
 It's amazing and overwhelming if you allow yourself to think about it.

2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:08.480
 Which whatever, exactly like, well, I'm fortunate with chess you have a few set options.

2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:09.480
 Two dimensional.

2:37:09.480 --> 2:37:10.480
 At least in space.

2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:11.480
 Two dimensional constraints.

2:37:11.480 --> 2:37:12.480
 Yeah.

2:37:12.480 --> 2:37:18.280
 There is unlimited possibilities and unlimited beautiful things happening all around you.

2:37:18.280 --> 2:37:25.080
 So I don't think there's a kind of sense that somehow you're limited in your, in the

2:37:25.080 --> 2:37:31.800
 places of, in the way you can see the world and how you can interact with that world.

2:37:31.800 --> 2:37:38.560
 I am overwhelmed by the lack of limit that all of us should be, have you looked around,

2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:40.520
 you could do whatever the hell you want.

2:37:40.520 --> 2:37:42.280
 Nobody will remember you anyway.

2:37:42.280 --> 2:37:44.160
 All of us will be dead one day.

2:37:44.160 --> 2:37:45.920
 You could do anything.

2:37:45.920 --> 2:37:51.520
 You can, I don't know, you can get naked and run around the city as long as you're not

2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:54.640
 hurting anybody and it doesn't matter.

2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:56.640
 Austin, I mean.

2:37:56.640 --> 2:37:57.640
 Austin.

2:37:57.640 --> 2:37:58.640
 Exactly.

2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:04.680
 It seems like a to do item for anybody living in Austin for sure.

2:38:04.680 --> 2:38:09.680
 But you know, the, the, the spectrum is an interesting concept because that is, you know,

2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:14.400
 when I say, when I refer to the spectrum, I'm actually referring to, it's a precise

2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:19.080
 clinical term, but you're right, it's been coopted more broadly and it is widely used

2:38:19.080 --> 2:38:25.120
 and it can be an unfair categorization of someone who's socially and occupationally

2:38:25.120 --> 2:38:26.120
 very healthy.

2:38:26.120 --> 2:38:33.600
 But that is critical because we, we don't define a disorder unless there's social or

2:38:33.600 --> 2:38:34.600
 occupational dysfunction.

2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:36.760
 It doesn't matter what the symptoms are.

2:38:36.760 --> 2:38:39.800
 I've had patients who are pleasantly hallucinating.

2:38:39.800 --> 2:38:43.160
 So frankly, psychotic, but doesn't affect their lives.

2:38:43.160 --> 2:38:50.240
 So I don't give that person as diagnosis because there's not social or occupational dysfunction.

2:38:50.240 --> 2:38:56.680
 Same with any, anything on this, you know, any of the diverse symptoms of autism spectrum

2:38:56.680 --> 2:38:58.680
 disorder.

2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:03.720
 If someone has them, but they're successful socially and occupationally, we don't say

2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:07.760
 that there's a disorder, but then you're right that the concept of the spectrum does

2:39:07.760 --> 2:39:16.160
 become a useful, you know, pigeonholing device, which is maybe not, not the best thing.

2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:17.160
 Yeah.

2:39:17.160 --> 2:39:21.160
 And eye contact is interesting one is interesting one.

2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:23.760
 I'm torn on it.

2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:29.720
 I'm torn about the usefulness of eye contact because people kind of make fun of it, but

2:39:29.720 --> 2:39:33.360
 let me just say one thing about eye contact and about life in general.

2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:39.600
 It's okay to be weird, but like some people when you have your eyes closed and there's

2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:41.840
 that weird, what is happening to this creature?

2:39:41.840 --> 2:39:44.960
 Like you see a weird creature on the side of the road.

2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:45.960
 It's interesting.

2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:46.960
 Yeah.

2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:51.920
 I mean, the weird stuff, I'm going to go back to Robin Williams with the, that's the

2:39:51.920 --> 2:39:52.920
 good stuff.

2:39:52.920 --> 2:39:53.920
 Right?

2:39:53.920 --> 2:39:59.360
 He has that whole speech about him and his wife and what he loves, all the little peculiarities,

2:39:59.360 --> 2:40:05.760
 all the weird stuff and that like, let those flourish, let those like celebrate those in

2:40:05.760 --> 2:40:11.040
 yourself and not in some kind of woke way, but in some like very human way.

2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:13.120
 This is what makes us as the weirdness.

2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:14.120
 Yeah.

2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:17.440
 I'm 100% on board with that.

2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:26.000
 And I don't think, you know, people who are happy and who have people in their lives who

2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:32.360
 are happy with them, these are, I think, let the weirdness flourish, let the, let the,

2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:35.360
 all the different ways members of the human family can be different.

2:40:35.360 --> 2:40:36.360
 Let's see them all.

2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:40.440
 That's one of our, that's one of the joys of being alive is seeing all the ways we can

2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:42.200
 be human.

2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:50.320
 And I think about it all the time, why do we have all these ways of being human?

2:40:50.320 --> 2:40:55.880
 And even within one individual, you go through phases of life where you express different

2:40:55.880 --> 2:40:59.320
 sides of your way of being, which is also a pretty fun opportunity, right?

2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:05.720
 You can go through phases where you're in one mode and phases when you're in another mode

2:41:05.720 --> 2:41:09.840
 and let that, you know, just let that, let that flourish too.

2:41:09.840 --> 2:41:13.360
 But the ways that you can be you vary as well.

2:41:13.360 --> 2:41:15.840
 I think that's important for people to explore.

2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:23.680
 And I should, like, because if you can address the, the, the internet, but I would like to

2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:34.560
 sort of ask the internet to celebrate the, the weirdness of people like that's, it's

2:41:34.560 --> 2:41:40.080
 the Robin Williams, uh, uh, people call these imperfections, but they're not, that's the

2:41:40.080 --> 2:41:48.160
 good stuff for anyone, individual person, find the weird stuff and celebrate it as opposed

2:41:48.160 --> 2:41:55.240
 to what the internet often does, which is find the weird stuff and criticize it.

2:41:55.240 --> 2:42:00.080
 Because when you criticize the weird stuff, you're creating conformity, which is another

2:42:00.080 --> 2:42:07.080
 human thing, but that, that conformity creates a boring world.

2:42:07.080 --> 2:42:10.920
 You want the weird, you want the crazy.

2:42:10.920 --> 2:42:13.480
 That's what fun is made of that.

2:42:13.480 --> 2:42:19.160
 That's the, uh, the foundation of humor and the, all of the ways in which we deal with

2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:25.120
 the, with the, with the suffering in the world, with the injustices in the world is like this

2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:32.720
 like huge variety of weird, uh, yeah, I don't know.

2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:38.040
 And that's what at the depth of psychiatry is like, you want to, uh, acknowledge the

2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:44.800
 weird, celebrate the weird, like step around it to find the particular aspects of weird

2:42:44.800 --> 2:42:46.720
 that are debilitating.

2:42:46.720 --> 2:42:50.160
 Like you said, there are somehow negatively affecting your ability to function in the

2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:54.600
 world as opposed to trying to shut it all down.

2:42:54.600 --> 2:42:55.600
 That's right.

2:42:55.600 --> 2:43:03.200
 Well, on that topic, I mean, I'd love to talk to you about schizophrenia.

2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:07.920
 What is schizophrenia from your research and from your general understanding and what is

2:43:07.920 --> 2:43:16.400
 the full landscape of suffering and, uh, wisdom that schizophrenia explores?

2:43:16.400 --> 2:43:22.360
 Schizophrenia is a state where there is a break from reality.

2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:27.760
 And so this can show up as we call them the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

2:43:27.760 --> 2:43:32.480
 These include hallucinations, hearing something or seeing something that's not there, usually

2:43:32.480 --> 2:43:39.360
 auditory hallucinations, paranoia, people can have complex fears, delusions, which we

2:43:39.360 --> 2:43:41.360
 call fixed false beliefs.

2:43:41.360 --> 2:43:46.880
 People get an extremely unshakable, but completely implausible idea about something sometimes

2:43:46.880 --> 2:43:49.920
 relates to themselves, sometimes to the world.

2:43:49.920 --> 2:43:54.760
 These we call the positive symptoms, break from reality as we know it.

2:43:54.760 --> 2:43:59.960
 Then there are the negative symptoms that come with it, and these are progressive.

2:43:59.960 --> 2:44:04.520
 These are flattening of emotion as we call it.

2:44:04.520 --> 2:44:10.040
 So it's starting to express less and less positive emotion, ending more in a neutral

2:44:10.040 --> 2:44:12.280
 or flat state.

2:44:12.280 --> 2:44:18.640
 Thought disorder, inability to work with complex patterns of planning or thinking so you can't

2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:19.640
 make plans.

2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:21.280
 You'd have poor working memory.

2:44:21.280 --> 2:44:27.960
 You can't keep track of where you were in a conversation, in a sequence of actions.

2:44:27.960 --> 2:44:37.120
 So poor and impaired working with the thoughts of oneself and then these positive symptoms

2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:38.120
 of break from reality.

2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:39.120
 Okay.

2:44:39.120 --> 2:44:42.360
 Now why does this, why do these come together?

2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:44.080
 What's the neurobiology of it?

2:44:44.080 --> 2:44:45.920
 Again, we don't know.

2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:48.000
 Schizophrenia extremely genetically determined.

2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:55.000
 If you look at the numbers, it could be upwards of 80% genetically determined.

2:44:55.000 --> 2:44:58.920
 One percent of the human population around the world, it's universal.

2:44:58.920 --> 2:45:04.800
 It's not confined to any one culture, not even really biased in one culture or another,

2:45:04.800 --> 2:45:09.760
 about 1% around the world.

2:45:09.760 --> 2:45:12.520
 Has this progressive quality to it untreated?

2:45:12.520 --> 2:45:13.520
 So it's very interesting.

2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:15.080
 There's a break that happens.

2:45:15.080 --> 2:45:22.680
 We call it first break when someone experiences their first disruption of reality.

2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:25.200
 They can have a completely typical life up until that point.

2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:30.800
 So you might have a, and I've seen just heartbreaking cases of like this, like this in the Stanford

2:45:30.800 --> 2:45:37.160
 emergency room where a kid who's come there has been extremely high functioning in that

2:45:37.160 --> 2:45:43.640
 sense of academic achievement and athletic and interpersonal and then comes to college.

2:45:43.640 --> 2:45:49.760
 Really in men, it's around 18, 19 when the first break happens.

2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:55.360
 Some terrifying paranoia hits or some auditory hallucinations start.

2:45:55.360 --> 2:45:57.960
 They're getting screamed at by a voice in their head.

2:45:57.960 --> 2:45:59.640
 So devastating.

2:45:59.640 --> 2:46:06.200
 With women, comes on also often a little later, sometimes in the 20s, and it can be progressive.

2:46:06.200 --> 2:46:10.040
 If it's not treated, it just progresses and progresses.

2:46:10.040 --> 2:46:17.240
 The voices become overwhelming, the delusions and paranoia extend and expand.

2:46:17.240 --> 2:46:20.480
 The negative symptoms particularly become more and more severe.

2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:26.520
 So one can't even maintain thoughts in any sort of ordered fashion.

2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:33.600
 And then eventually, it can be fatal, can lead to suicide, it can lead to erratic behavior

2:46:33.600 --> 2:46:36.880
 that leads to accidents.

2:46:36.880 --> 2:46:39.000
 Now it can be treated.

2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:42.320
 There are medications that help, fortunately.

2:46:42.320 --> 2:46:44.160
 They have side effects, so they're not perfect.

2:46:44.160 --> 2:46:50.600
 You can have movement problems and actually a whole host of different side effects that

2:46:50.600 --> 2:46:51.760
 come from the medications.

2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:58.200
 But we can help people now with schizophrenia very, very significantly.

2:46:58.200 --> 2:47:03.280
 But the amazing thing, and this is emblematic of where psychiatry stands, we don't have

2:47:03.280 --> 2:47:04.640
 the deep understanding.

2:47:04.640 --> 2:47:09.760
 Just like with depression, we don't have that heart as a pump level of understanding that

2:47:09.760 --> 2:47:14.520
 we'd like to have with schizophrenia, despite it being so biological, so genetic in its

2:47:14.520 --> 2:47:15.520
 nature.

2:47:15.520 --> 2:47:22.520
 So is there a way to return to the other side of the first break?

2:47:22.520 --> 2:47:27.600
 So when you have a break with reality, is there a way to kind of stitch it together?

2:47:27.600 --> 2:47:32.480
 So some people, that works, but we don't really know how.

2:47:32.480 --> 2:47:38.640
 So medications, antipsychotic medications, we call them, they block a particular neurotransmitter

2:47:38.640 --> 2:47:44.600
 receptor called the serotonin 2A receptor.

2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:49.880
 And they modulate dopamine as well and other neurotransmitters.

2:47:49.880 --> 2:47:56.360
 These can take someone who's actively hallucinating, actively paranoid, put them back in a completely

2:47:56.360 --> 2:48:01.400
 normal state, and some people stay that way indefinitely.

2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:07.360
 So you can bring people back from that back to the other side, have it stitched together.

2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:15.520
 More typically, you'll end up in some intermediate state where there's symptoms are reduced powerfully,

2:48:15.520 --> 2:48:19.520
 but there might be still something there and you've got a drop down in functioning that

2:48:19.520 --> 2:48:22.160
 may be persistent for a while.

2:48:22.160 --> 2:48:26.160
 But concepts, what physically is going on?

2:48:26.160 --> 2:48:31.960
 One idea is that it's communication within the brain.

2:48:31.960 --> 2:48:36.440
 One part of the brain is not able to tell other parts of the brain what it's doing.

2:48:36.440 --> 2:48:40.280
 And so the auditory hallucinations are very interesting in this regard.

2:48:40.280 --> 2:48:44.320
 They often have this conversational inner monologue like quality.

2:48:44.320 --> 2:48:47.920
 As we're walking along the street, we may have an inner monologue thoughts about what's

2:48:47.920 --> 2:48:49.240
 going on.

2:48:49.240 --> 2:48:52.920
 If we see somebody we don't like, we may have a thought where somebody would punch that

2:48:52.920 --> 2:48:55.360
 guy, something like that, or maybe I should punch that guy.

2:48:55.360 --> 2:49:02.440
 But these are so far below where we would ever act or even think of acting.

2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:09.120
 But they're just things that come up and in people with schizophrenia, those inner thoughts,

2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:15.320
 that inner monologue is not recognized as the inner monologue of the self.

2:49:15.320 --> 2:49:22.040
 And so it's perceived as something coming from the outside, or from inside, but from

2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:23.040
 another entity.

2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:29.360
 Oh, another entity, I thought you meant like another room inside the same building.

2:49:29.360 --> 2:49:31.960
 Another room inside there, yeah.

2:49:31.960 --> 2:49:39.840
 And so it could be conceptualized as a communication within the brain problem, notifying another

2:49:39.840 --> 2:49:40.840
 part of the brain what's going on.

2:49:40.840 --> 2:49:43.360
 And there's some evidence consistent with that.

2:49:43.360 --> 2:49:48.840
 I don't know if you can help with this, but sometimes I've been talking to quite a few

2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:58.480
 homeless folks recently, just what I do is I hang out at night and talk to interesting

2:49:58.480 --> 2:50:03.840
 people and some of them, and I've known people in the past who suffer from schizophrenia

2:50:03.840 --> 2:50:12.560
 and some of them like self will describe as that as something they suffer from.

2:50:12.560 --> 2:50:15.880
 And they seem to understand something deeply about this world.

2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:23.640
 I don't know if it's correlated or maybe it's another aspect of like depression, all those

2:50:23.640 --> 2:50:31.560
 things that I've encountered in my own life is maybe just the struggle and the suffering

2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:35.720
 has taken you through a life where you think deeply about life.

2:50:35.720 --> 2:50:42.240
 There's like self reflection that society forces on you because it's a disorder of some

2:50:42.240 --> 2:50:43.480
 kind.

2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:48.360
 It's interesting, I guess my only sort of anecdotal observation is people who suffer

2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:57.560
 from schizophrenia seem to be very interesting and very thoughtful in a nonlinear way about

2:50:57.560 --> 2:51:00.080
 the world.

2:51:00.080 --> 2:51:04.680
 I've noticed that it's not always positive.

2:51:04.680 --> 2:51:10.200
 The unusual ways they view the world, but it's always interesting.

2:51:10.200 --> 2:51:15.600
 It could be conspiratorial thinking too, but the theories they have about the way the

2:51:15.600 --> 2:51:21.080
 world functions, often very well read, which is also interesting because they're almost

2:51:21.080 --> 2:51:24.640
 like looking for helpful answers from somewhere.

2:51:24.640 --> 2:51:31.840
 And so there might be citing some very interesting literature and then using that to, there's

2:51:31.840 --> 2:51:35.920
 a stickiness in their mind to different models of the world and trying to make sense of that

2:51:35.920 --> 2:51:36.920
 world.

2:51:36.920 --> 2:51:40.360
 So those models could include conspiracy theories.

2:51:40.360 --> 2:51:46.320
 They're very attuned to complexity and they come up with unlikely explanations, which

2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:50.440
 is one of the things that makes them, it makes it hard for them to function in the world

2:51:50.440 --> 2:51:55.680
 is how unlikely their explanations are, but you're right, there's a depth of consideration

2:51:55.680 --> 2:52:04.440
 of the complexity of the world and a concern about it and an impulse to work to understand

2:52:04.440 --> 2:52:07.240
 it that is actually quite refreshing.

2:52:07.240 --> 2:52:15.360
 But the first case in the medical literature, there was a classical schizophrenia.

2:52:15.360 --> 2:52:22.240
 There was a patient named James Tilly Matthews who had this, he sketched out for his doctor

2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:31.720
 the experiences he was sensing and he drew himself as a cowering figure on the ground

2:52:31.720 --> 2:52:39.600
 controlled by a loom, a weaving device that was sending threads, long threads, projections

2:52:39.600 --> 2:52:45.960
 across space from the loom to him, to his arms and to his body and controlling him from

2:52:45.960 --> 2:52:52.200
 afar and he called us the air loom, a loom in the air.

2:52:52.200 --> 2:52:56.560
 And it was such an evocative thing because this was the start of the industrial revolution

2:52:56.560 --> 2:53:04.200
 or mid and it was where really industrial strength looms and weaving devices were really

2:53:04.200 --> 2:53:10.400
 kind of the emblematic of the most complex, powerful technological achievements of the

2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:17.400
 time and so that was the explanation available to him to explain how his body was seemingly

2:53:17.400 --> 2:53:22.960
 moved without his volition and these days, of course, people with schizophrenia will

2:53:22.960 --> 2:53:30.200
 have more technology appropriate interpretations, they'll have delusions of satellite or alien

2:53:30.200 --> 2:53:36.400
 control or beamed information, very, very common to have this delusion of a government

2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:43.480
 agency sending electromagnetic or radio frequency information to control their limbs.

2:53:43.480 --> 2:53:52.040
 But it's the same thing, whether it's a thread from an industrial revolution loom or RF radiation,

2:53:52.040 --> 2:53:56.840
 it's the same thing just adapted to the moment explaining, trying to explain the world they

2:53:56.840 --> 2:53:58.600
 live in and their relationship to the world.

2:53:58.600 --> 2:54:04.360
 But unconstrained by sort of the thing that's socially acceptable, which is both refreshing

2:54:04.360 --> 2:54:08.680
 and dangerous.

2:54:08.680 --> 2:54:13.320
 I wrote down a question, why do we cry?

2:54:13.320 --> 2:54:17.440
 Are tears a window to some depths that we ourselves don't know?

2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:21.440
 I almost want to make fun of myself for that question, but you do talk seriously about

2:54:21.440 --> 2:54:22.440
 crying in the book.

2:54:22.440 --> 2:54:28.720
 In fact, the whole first chapter really tussles with crying as why do we do it?

2:54:28.720 --> 2:54:29.720
 What does it mean?

2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:31.040
 Why is it involuntary?

2:54:31.040 --> 2:54:37.840
 It seems like a weakness because it's so involuntary and it's reflecting something true and inside

2:54:37.840 --> 2:54:41.400
 at the level of the individual, that seems like a problem, wouldn't it be better if we

2:54:41.400 --> 2:54:49.000
 could control it, if we could not show that emotion when it's not useful, show it when

2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:50.000
 it's useful?

2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:53.080
 It's largely involuntary.

2:54:53.080 --> 2:55:01.720
 And so there's a value to it, I think, as an honest reporter of a need, of hope and

2:55:01.720 --> 2:55:03.520
 frailty at the same time.

2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:06.760
 I am a human being.

2:55:06.760 --> 2:55:12.320
 There's a frailty to myself or my situation where I need social help.

2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:14.720
 I need help from my community.

2:55:14.720 --> 2:55:22.000
 I have hope that that is possible, but I'm not enough for myself, I need the community.

2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:25.520
 That I think is what the social signal of crying is.

2:55:25.520 --> 2:55:32.640
 Now people have studied crying, it's an extreme, you can quantify the extent to which the presence

2:55:32.640 --> 2:55:41.000
 of tears on a face triggers reactions and onlookers and you can show the same face in the presence

2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:48.200
 or absence of tears and show that to people under quantifiable and rigorous psychological

2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:57.240
 conditions and tears are much more powerful at stirring the desire to help in viewers than

2:55:57.240 --> 2:56:04.160
 any other facial feature, which is pretty interesting that it's the honest one that's

2:56:04.160 --> 2:56:05.920
 also the most powerful, right?

2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:11.560
 It kind of indicates there's a certain logic to our design as social beings that we have

2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:14.720
 an honest report.

2:56:14.720 --> 2:56:23.560
 That's hard to control on, but is it well understood how that connects to the internal

2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:27.280
 state of emotion?

2:56:27.280 --> 2:56:30.560
 There are long range projections that come.

2:56:30.560 --> 2:56:31.880
 So where is crying generate?

2:56:31.880 --> 2:56:33.280
 This is the confusing thing about it.

2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:38.240
 So that we have a little tear duct, the lacrimal gland that leads the release of fluid, it

2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:42.280
 ejects fluid and it comes out in those, of course.

2:56:42.280 --> 2:56:47.160
 That whole system was designed to keep the eye clean, to wash out particulate irritants.

2:56:47.160 --> 2:56:52.200
 So it's a long standing, as long as we've had eyes and have been out of the water in

2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:54.040
 our evolution, we've needed this sort of thing.

2:56:54.040 --> 2:57:00.480
 So long standing biological structure recently coopted, it seems, by our evolution as social

2:57:00.480 --> 2:57:03.000
 primates.

2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:04.000
 Now how could that happen?

2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:09.320
 Well, the lacrimal gland is controlled by structures in the pons, which is a structure

2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:15.360
 deep in our, just above our neck, between our neck and our head, and reflecting its

2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:16.800
 ancient origin, right?

2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:22.360
 As you go farther down toward the spinal cord, these are the more basic, early evolved structures.

2:57:22.360 --> 2:57:30.960
 And in the pons, that's where breathing is controlled, tear duct contraction.

2:57:30.960 --> 2:57:36.120
 And what we found, and with Optogenetics, we helped sort this out, there are long range

2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:41.920
 projections from fear and anxiety regions in the forebrain that project all the way

2:57:41.920 --> 2:57:45.400
 to the pons in and around those areas.

2:57:45.400 --> 2:57:50.760
 The reason those are there, we think is to regulate the respiratory rate changes, the

2:57:50.760 --> 2:57:53.080
 breathing changes of fear and anxiety.

2:57:53.080 --> 2:57:57.760
 So we know when we're in a state of fear and anxiety, we need, we cope better if we have

2:57:57.760 --> 2:58:02.120
 elevated heart rate, elevated respiratory rate, more blood pumping around, more oxygenated

2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:05.240
 blood, we're ready to meet the threat if it happens.

2:58:05.240 --> 2:58:11.360
 All those cells are down there in the pons too, right next to the lacrimal duct, the

2:58:11.360 --> 2:58:12.640
 tear gland neurons.

2:58:12.640 --> 2:58:22.440
 And so almost certainly this fear, anxiety induced crying arose from a very slightly misdirected

2:58:22.440 --> 2:58:29.080
 long range projection that was there to regulate breathing and a little twist, just a little

2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:35.440
 misdirection, a little missing of one sign post to stop here going on a little farther,

2:58:35.440 --> 2:58:39.000
 getting to the lacrimal gland neurons gave us crying.

2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:43.760
 And that's, and we just have it, that peculiar sort of structure, neuronal structure that

2:58:43.760 --> 2:58:46.760
 resulted in that, that's what we're stuck with.

2:58:46.760 --> 2:58:53.760
 And that ends up being, in terms of social interaction, one of the more important authentic

2:58:53.760 --> 2:58:59.640
 involuntary displays of interstate and social communication.

2:58:59.640 --> 2:59:02.480
 Oh, yeah.

2:59:02.480 --> 2:59:03.960
 Is there other stuff like that?

2:59:03.960 --> 2:59:09.720
 I mean, do you, yeah, I mean, the human face is fascinating as a display of emotion, as

2:59:09.720 --> 2:59:13.880
 a display of truth and lying and all those kinds of things.

2:59:13.880 --> 2:59:24.080
 I personally, I mean, we're all, I suppose, have different sensors that are sensitive

2:59:24.080 --> 2:59:25.880
 to certain aspects of the human face.

2:59:25.880 --> 2:59:31.320
 But to me, it seems like the eyes are really important communication or something.

2:59:31.320 --> 2:59:35.160
 You know, I've talked to a few sort of girls about like Botox and stuff like that.

2:59:35.160 --> 2:59:42.400
 And it always bothers me when, I guess guys can do this too, but like when women speak

2:59:42.400 --> 2:59:49.880
 negatively of, I guess you can call them wrinkles at the tips of an eye.

2:59:49.880 --> 2:59:57.520
 But like, to me, when you smile, when you wait, not wink, but like narrow the eyes to

2:59:57.520 --> 3:00:02.440
 communicate, something is communicated and those, that stuff is really useful, the human

3:00:02.440 --> 3:00:03.440
 face.

3:00:03.440 --> 3:00:05.600
 And when it's gone, that something is missing.

3:00:05.600 --> 3:00:10.800
 And a lot of little stuff, it feels like it can really, it's almost involuntary, I guess,

3:00:10.800 --> 3:00:14.040
 but it's harder to describe as the presence or absence of tears.

3:00:14.040 --> 3:00:18.720
 It's like something about this person, you can tell they're not bullshitting you.

3:00:18.720 --> 3:00:19.720
 Yeah.

3:00:19.720 --> 3:00:24.880
 And so that was, that was what made presumably that, that tear recruitment so powerful as

3:00:24.880 --> 3:00:29.880
 it just landed in this very high value real estate for social communication.

3:00:29.880 --> 3:00:35.080
 If it had gone to, you know, there's a lot of neurons in the, in the ponds that control,

3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:40.880
 you know, movement of large, you know, muscles, you know, elsewhere, that would have been much

3:00:40.880 --> 3:00:43.520
 less effective as a social signal than something around the eye.

3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:48.880
 So it was, however, that, that little misdirection happened, it landed in a great area for social

3:00:48.880 --> 3:00:50.520
 communication.

3:00:50.520 --> 3:00:55.560
 And because it was coming from the fear and anxiety circuits that regulate that necessary

3:00:55.560 --> 3:01:01.920
 involuntary change in heart rate and respiratory rate, it also was involuntary and that became

3:01:01.920 --> 3:01:05.960
 valuable as a, as a truth signal as, as social beings.

3:01:05.960 --> 3:01:10.040
 So very interesting when you think about the origins of the human family, the origins

3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:16.840
 of social structures and our ability and need to call for help when there's hope, but, but

3:01:16.840 --> 3:01:20.600
 need at the same time.

3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:22.120
 What is consciousness?

3:01:22.120 --> 3:01:26.480
 So you're actually using techniques.

3:01:26.480 --> 3:01:32.320
 I mean, even putting psychiatry aside, just looking at optogenetics, you're trying to

3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:36.120
 understand some of these deep aspects of the human mind.

3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:39.960
 And maybe this is a good time to return to a question you mentioned, you might have an

3:01:39.960 --> 3:01:45.160
 opinion on if there are such a thing as a theory of everything for the human mind.

3:01:45.160 --> 3:01:51.680
 Because surely answering of what is consciousness is as, well, that's not sure, but it seems

3:01:51.680 --> 3:01:57.080
 like it's a fundamental part of the human experience in the human mind and solving that

3:01:57.080 --> 3:02:02.680
 question will result in solving the bigger thing about the human mind.

3:02:02.680 --> 3:02:08.880
 The flip side could be consciousness is just the few neurons that are generating some useful

3:02:08.880 --> 3:02:09.880
 thing.

3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:16.600
 They make us, it's like the, the sense of self that you talked about in the, in the mice.

3:02:16.600 --> 3:02:21.120
 Maybe it's a subset of those cells that are just creating a richer sense of self.

3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:23.040
 And that's it.

3:02:23.040 --> 3:02:26.440
 So this is a great question.

3:02:26.440 --> 3:02:29.960
 All neuroscientists think about this and a lot of non neuroscientists too.

3:02:29.960 --> 3:02:34.600
 It's, it's such a, it's the reason a lot of people came to the study of the brain is

3:02:34.600 --> 3:02:40.200
 to think about consciousness and not just being awake or alert, but really what's sometimes

3:02:40.200 --> 3:02:45.880
 called the hard problem of consciousness, which is what is that nature of that inner

3:02:45.880 --> 3:02:53.400
 subjective sense we have, not just information processing, but feeling something about the

3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:59.280
 information that, what is that inner state of subjectivity physically?

3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:01.120
 What is it?

3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:03.720
 And that's called the hard problem of consciousness.

3:03:03.720 --> 3:03:08.960
 And it's not an extremely well defined question.

3:03:08.960 --> 3:03:14.880
 Everybody has sort of a sense of what it means, but it's such a hard problem because you run

3:03:14.880 --> 3:03:18.720
 into paradoxes quite quickly the more you think about it.

3:03:18.720 --> 3:03:26.160
 And that is exciting also because it makes us think, actually, there's some fundamental,

3:03:26.160 --> 3:03:30.640
 there's a big thing that we're missing at the brain is not just a collection of little

3:03:30.640 --> 3:03:31.640
 tricks.

3:03:31.640 --> 3:03:32.640
 There is a big, big concept.

3:03:32.640 --> 3:03:37.640
 So that's your sense of the big, because like a flip side could be with optogenetics.

3:03:37.640 --> 3:03:40.480
 You can, there's an engineering question.

3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:44.000
 Can you turn consciousness on and off like a light switch?

3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:45.000
 Okay.

3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:49.920
 So here's where exactly consciousness frames the problem extremely well, and it frames

3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:50.920
 it the following way.

3:03:50.920 --> 3:03:59.640
 So I told you earlier that we can stimulate 20 or 25 cells in the visual cortex of a mouse

3:03:59.640 --> 3:04:04.920
 and we can make it behave and we can make its brain act as if it's seeing something

3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:06.160
 that isn't there.

3:04:06.160 --> 3:04:07.280
 We have that level of control now.

3:04:07.280 --> 3:04:13.240
 We can pick out 25 neurons, play in activity, and both behavior and in the brain, it's

3:04:13.240 --> 3:04:15.840
 as if it's seeing something specific.

3:04:15.840 --> 3:04:16.840
 Okay.

3:04:16.840 --> 3:04:20.720
 Now, let's do a thought experiment, you know, a gandhankan experiment.

3:04:20.720 --> 3:04:22.920
 And let's play this out.

3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:28.000
 Let's say we could do the same thing for every single neuron in the brain of a human being.

3:04:28.000 --> 3:04:33.560
 Let's say we had total control and I could do something like I could show you a rich

3:04:33.560 --> 3:04:37.280
 deep color red and you could look at it and you would be aware that it's red, but also

3:04:37.280 --> 3:04:39.520
 you might have some feelings about it.

3:04:39.520 --> 3:04:43.200
 Something would be stirred in you, some subjective sense as you looked at that rich color red

3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:50.480
 and then I would take away the visual stimulus and I would, in this thought experiment, I

3:04:50.480 --> 3:04:57.000
 would, using some hyperoptogenetics, I would play in exactly the same pattern of activity

3:04:57.000 --> 3:05:01.680
 in every cell in your brain for as long as it was needed, whatever, 15 seconds, something

3:05:01.680 --> 3:05:09.360
 like that, that exactly matched what was going on when you were feeling that inner subjective

3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:10.360
 sense.

3:05:10.360 --> 3:05:11.360
 Okay.

3:05:11.360 --> 3:05:13.360
 Let's do a thought experiment.

3:05:13.360 --> 3:05:18.440
 A question for you is, would you be feeling that same inner subjective sense?

3:05:18.440 --> 3:05:19.520
 Stimulus is gone.

3:05:19.520 --> 3:05:23.160
 Every neuron is doing the same thing because I'm controlling it.

3:05:23.160 --> 3:05:26.160
 There's a philosophical question there.

3:05:26.160 --> 3:05:29.080
 If you ask me specifically, I would say yes.

3:05:29.080 --> 3:05:30.080
 Okay.

3:05:30.080 --> 3:05:31.080
 Good.

3:05:31.080 --> 3:05:33.840
 Most people would say that because it's hard to say no, right?

3:05:33.840 --> 3:05:34.840
 It's very hard to say no.

3:05:34.840 --> 3:05:39.600
 If every cell in your brain is doing what it was doing, what else could be different?

3:05:39.600 --> 3:05:42.760
 Well, most normal people would say yes.

3:05:42.760 --> 3:05:46.840
 Of course, philosophers would then start saying no.

3:05:46.840 --> 3:05:54.280
 They're the ones that say, I'm sort of parallel and sorry if it's a bit of an interruption,

3:05:54.280 --> 3:06:02.040
 but if there's a robot that's conscious in front of you, if it appears conscious, then

3:06:02.040 --> 3:06:03.200
 it's conscious.

3:06:03.200 --> 3:06:09.560
 To me, of course, philosophers again speak up and say, well, no, how do you know it's

3:06:09.560 --> 3:06:10.560
 conscious?

3:06:10.560 --> 3:06:13.600
 Well, how do you know anything is conscious?

3:06:13.600 --> 3:06:22.920
 As normal humans, we tend to lean on the experience versus some kind of philosophical concept.

3:06:22.920 --> 3:06:28.480
 The great thing about what you just said, the Turing test is it's very practical if

3:06:28.480 --> 3:06:31.080
 it acts conscious, it is conscious.

3:06:31.080 --> 3:06:32.840
 But I think that's limiting.

3:06:32.840 --> 3:06:34.720
 I like the thought experiment.

3:06:34.720 --> 3:06:36.400
 I think it's actually more informative.

3:06:36.400 --> 3:06:43.400
 I'm halfway to the conclusion there, but let's take it as your answer was yes, that

3:06:43.400 --> 3:06:45.400
 you would be feeling the same thing.

3:06:45.400 --> 3:06:46.400
 Okay.

3:06:46.400 --> 3:06:49.720
 Now, here's where it gets fun.

3:06:49.720 --> 3:06:56.880
 Now that every cell in your brain knows what it has to do in the sense that we know it

3:06:56.880 --> 3:07:04.760
 and we're providing it, your brain cells don't need to be in your head anymore at all, right?

3:07:04.760 --> 3:07:08.560
 The only reason they're next to each other, the only reason they're wired together is

3:07:08.560 --> 3:07:13.560
 to affect each other, to stimulate or inhibit each other, but we don't need that anymore

3:07:13.560 --> 3:07:18.080
 because optogenetically, we're providing that activity pattern for as long as needed.

3:07:18.080 --> 3:07:20.080
 We're providing the effect of the communication.

3:07:20.080 --> 3:07:21.480
 They don't need to be connected anymore.

3:07:21.480 --> 3:07:24.480
 They don't even need to be in your head.

3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:32.640
 I could spread your neurons all over the continent, all over the galaxy, and I could still provide

3:07:32.640 --> 3:07:39.080
 the same stimulus pattern over 10 or 15 seconds to all those neurons, and somewhere Lex Friedman

3:07:39.080 --> 3:07:46.400
 would have to be, even though no longer existing as a physical object anymore, would be feeling

3:07:46.400 --> 3:07:51.240
 that subjective feeling, and it's inescapable because it's exactly the same as the previous

3:07:51.240 --> 3:07:52.240
 situation.

3:07:52.240 --> 3:07:56.920
 All the neurons have to be spatially like the locality constraint.

3:07:56.920 --> 3:08:01.320
 They have to be spatially close to each other.

3:08:01.320 --> 3:08:08.800
 When you talk about light, opto, which is funny because light is the fastest traveling

3:08:08.800 --> 3:08:11.640
 thing that we know of.

3:08:11.640 --> 3:08:14.600
 Maybe let's not put them all over the universe because we might get relativistic problems

3:08:14.600 --> 3:08:15.600
 then.

3:08:15.600 --> 3:08:16.600
 Let's just keep them out.

3:08:16.600 --> 3:08:17.600
 Let's keep all your neurons.

3:08:17.600 --> 3:08:23.240
 Let's spread them over North America, and let's play them out, same pattern of activity.

3:08:23.240 --> 3:08:24.240
 It seems absurd, right?

3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:26.040
 There's no way that could be true.

3:08:26.040 --> 3:08:30.600
 There's no way that Lex would be feeling that internal sense if his neurons were spread

3:08:30.600 --> 3:08:35.320
 all over North America, and yet it's exactly the same as the previous situation where you

3:08:35.320 --> 3:08:36.320
 said, sure.

3:08:36.320 --> 3:08:37.320
 Wow.

3:08:37.320 --> 3:08:38.520
 We've got a paradox.

3:08:38.520 --> 3:08:39.520
 This is what makes people think.

3:08:39.520 --> 3:08:40.520
 Paradox though, sorry.

3:08:40.520 --> 3:08:42.640
 Maybe paradox is the wrong word.

3:08:42.640 --> 3:08:50.360
 We've got a problem because it reveals that there's something big about that internal

3:08:50.360 --> 3:08:54.600
 subjective state that we're not explaining, and we don't really have a hope of explaining

3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:55.600
 in the near future.

3:08:55.600 --> 3:09:00.680
 But don't you think we would still have that, it's just the word internal loses meaning,

3:09:00.680 --> 3:09:06.480
 but don't you think we would still have that internal subjective state?

3:09:06.480 --> 3:09:11.480
 If not, then where the heck is the magic coming from?

3:09:11.480 --> 3:09:22.040
 I think one of the problems that I think we need to let go of is we tend to, outside of

3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:26.480
 the experience of consciousness, the hard problem of consciousness, we tend to think

3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:30.600
 that we individual humans are really special.

3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:35.880
 Not the subjective experience, but the entirety of it, like the body that contains the things.

3:09:35.880 --> 3:09:45.280
 So the local, the constraint of all the stuff has to be together and it's all mine.

3:09:45.280 --> 3:09:51.160
 That's a very, I don't know if that has anything to do with the mechanisms that are creating

3:09:51.160 --> 3:09:52.160
 this.

3:09:52.160 --> 3:10:02.840
 So in fact, one really nice way to break through that is to either observe or create consciousness

3:10:02.840 --> 3:10:15.240
 that spans multiple organisms, like let's say it's not an organism dependent phenomena,

3:10:15.240 --> 3:10:24.480
 that the phenomena can, that's just a peculiar way it has evolved on earth, but it's a phenomena

3:10:24.480 --> 3:10:30.480
 that doesn't have anything to do with a specific biological system.

3:10:30.480 --> 3:10:32.040
 All right.

3:10:32.040 --> 3:10:40.760
 So and we have different parts of our brain exist and sometimes create complex awarenesses

3:10:40.760 --> 3:10:48.440
 of things that involve different neurons that are distributed widely and that need to communicate

3:10:48.440 --> 3:10:53.280
 with each other to form this joint representation, this state of consciousness.

3:10:53.280 --> 3:10:57.440
 But indeed, why do they have to be in the same head?

3:10:57.440 --> 3:11:02.280
 We don't know why that would be the case that they do.

3:11:02.280 --> 3:11:10.680
 And so that's a huge unanswered question in the field is what is it that binds the

3:11:10.680 --> 3:11:13.880
 activity of neurons together so they can form a joint representation?

3:11:13.880 --> 3:11:18.680
 And actually, this comes back to the dissociation experiment we talked about before where your

3:11:18.680 --> 3:11:23.880
 sense of self becomes separated from your body.

3:11:23.880 --> 3:11:28.960
 Those things that were refused in a joint representation, the same concept, unitary,

3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:31.680
 are now separate.

3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:37.440
 And in late 2020, we published a paper in Nature showing how this could be, we used

3:11:37.440 --> 3:11:44.040
 optogenetics to drive this rhythm that ketamine and PCP cause in retrosplenial cortex and

3:11:44.040 --> 3:11:49.560
 we got different parts of the brain to be out of sync and when they were active, never

3:11:49.560 --> 3:11:54.800
 able to be active at the same time, never able to form a joint representation at the

3:11:54.800 --> 3:11:56.200
 same time.

3:11:56.200 --> 3:11:58.080
 And so we've got a toehold into these questions.

3:11:58.080 --> 3:11:59.880
 We don't have the answers.

3:11:59.880 --> 3:12:02.720
 And that mimics the dynamics of ketamine effects.

3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:03.720
 Exactly.

3:12:03.720 --> 3:12:04.720
 Exactly.

3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:10.080
 And we're able to find that kind of oscillation, wow, wow, wow.

3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:15.920
 So if you get even greater and greater control with more control over individual neurons

3:12:15.920 --> 3:12:23.120
 and understanding, like if you think of certain neurons that having some role to play in the

3:12:23.120 --> 3:12:31.680
 sense of self, you can play like an orchestra that to create the certain degrees of consciousness,

3:12:31.680 --> 3:12:39.680
 degrees of subjectivity and thereby understand what is consciousness by having a very complicated

3:12:39.680 --> 3:12:42.080
 light switch essentially.

3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:47.360
 And here's the challenge is the nice thing about the thought experiment is that it kind

3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:56.800
 of highlights that we're going to hit a point where we're addressing some very, very fundamental

3:12:56.800 --> 3:12:57.800
 questions.

3:12:57.800 --> 3:13:07.640
 What allows the activity of two sets of neurons to become mutually relevant to each other?

3:13:07.640 --> 3:13:13.720
 This is in some ways maybe one of the deepest remaining questions in neuroscience is what

3:13:13.720 --> 3:13:18.480
 allows activity patterns to become relevant to each other.

3:13:18.480 --> 3:13:21.240
 Do they have to be in sync temporarily?

3:13:21.240 --> 3:13:27.560
 Do they need to be, is there some other quality that we don't know about that also needs to

3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:32.840
 be present to allow cells to fuse together into a joint representation?

3:13:32.840 --> 3:13:39.800
 Just so I understand because it feels close to some very, very deep idea.

3:13:39.800 --> 3:13:48.800
 So there's a bunch of semi distributive signals going on in the brain and you're saying there

3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:56.760
 could be something like a theory of everything if one to exist is to understand why, how and

3:13:56.760 --> 3:14:08.600
 why signals close to each other start becoming relevant to each other as part of some very

3:14:08.600 --> 3:14:17.160
 much bigger signal that they're producing, how they coordinate essentially because it's

3:14:17.160 --> 3:14:18.160
 very distributed.

3:14:18.160 --> 3:14:26.320
 I mean that's a kind of within a distributed system, how is order achieved and this is

3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:31.200
 a very specific kind of distributed system that is one of the most intelligent that we're

3:14:31.200 --> 3:14:34.920
 aware of in the known universe.

3:14:34.920 --> 3:14:42.680
 In that will maybe be something also an understanding of the full conscious experience too that

3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:44.560
 this kind of coordination.

3:14:44.560 --> 3:14:48.320
 How does the coordination between different neurons that are responsible for sense of

3:14:48.320 --> 3:14:49.320
 self?

3:14:49.320 --> 3:14:54.240
 How do they begin to form a big picture that we see as a human experience?

3:14:54.240 --> 3:14:55.600
 That's really, really interesting.

3:14:55.600 --> 3:15:01.400
 So uniting the small and the, I mean that's actually literally theory of everything, uniting

3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:08.040
 the small, the sort of the theory of the neuron, the function of the neuron with a big, just

3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:12.160
 the functioning of the entire mind.

3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:13.160
 That's right.

3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:19.080
 Keeping a toehold in both at the cellular level of resolution and the brain wide resolution

3:15:19.080 --> 3:15:20.080
 will be critical.

3:15:20.080 --> 3:15:23.680
 If you lose touch with either, I think you'll miss the big insight.

3:15:23.680 --> 3:15:29.280
 So that's what we're trying to do, keeping our, keeping grounded in the cellular resolution,

3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:35.040
 trying to keep the broadest brain wide perspective and meet in the middle.

3:15:35.040 --> 3:15:36.880
 Do you think you'll see it in your lifetime?

3:15:36.880 --> 3:15:39.520
 A major breakthrough in that dimension?

3:15:39.520 --> 3:15:40.520
 I have hope.

3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:41.520
 I have hope.

3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:45.840
 I'm, it's very hard to predict what will happen with big things like this.

3:15:45.840 --> 3:15:51.000
 If we don't get there, there'll be plenty of other exciting stuff, so it's okay.

3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:55.480
 But the other aspect of this whole thing is that your life is pretty short.

3:15:55.480 --> 3:15:56.800
 That's true.

3:15:56.800 --> 3:15:59.400
 So first of all, you can die any day.

3:15:59.400 --> 3:16:04.160
 I tend to try to think about that, that it ends, you can get in at any moment because

3:16:04.160 --> 3:16:05.760
 it really, really can.

3:16:05.760 --> 3:16:08.880
 And if not, it'll be soon anyway.

3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:09.880
 Do you think about that?

3:16:09.880 --> 3:16:11.640
 Do you think about your mortality?

3:16:11.640 --> 3:16:12.640
 I do.

3:16:12.640 --> 3:16:13.640
 Yeah.

3:16:13.640 --> 3:16:16.120
 It's, it comes back to what we talked about earlier.

3:16:16.120 --> 3:16:21.640
 I, you know, I never think I've done enough and it's, it's relevant to that for sure.

3:16:21.640 --> 3:16:23.840
 There's a deadline.

3:16:23.840 --> 3:16:24.840
 Yeah.

3:16:24.840 --> 3:16:30.520
 Do you think there's ever going to be a feeling where you sit back and you're really proud

3:16:30.520 --> 3:16:32.880
 of yourself?

3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:35.440
 I hope so.

3:16:35.440 --> 3:16:36.640
 Like I've done enough.

3:16:36.640 --> 3:16:38.400
 I've done everything there is.

3:16:38.400 --> 3:16:44.920
 Like, like, you know, cause the thing is a warrior has some number of battles in them.

3:16:44.920 --> 3:16:49.320
 And at a certain point, if you're deeply honest, it's like, well, this, that was a pretty good

3:16:49.320 --> 3:16:50.320
 run.

3:16:50.320 --> 3:16:52.480
 As far as runs goes, that was pretty good.

3:16:52.480 --> 3:16:53.480
 Right.

3:16:53.480 --> 3:17:01.760
 And you can hang up your helmet and then go sort of drink some ale, listen to some music

3:17:01.760 --> 3:17:04.960
 with the old lady and say, I did pretty good.

3:17:04.960 --> 3:17:07.960
 You think you'll get there?

3:17:07.960 --> 3:17:12.360
 I, you know, with something, with nature always has surprises for us.

3:17:12.360 --> 3:17:17.520
 We're always the curious mind is always after more.

3:17:17.520 --> 3:17:18.800
 But yeah, true.

3:17:18.800 --> 3:17:26.880
 But biology gives us other rewards, you know, children and family, community, and one can

3:17:26.880 --> 3:17:30.840
 feel good about those things.

3:17:30.840 --> 3:17:34.880
 Biology is full of rewards, but do you think about those rewards?

3:17:34.880 --> 3:17:37.200
 What do you think is the why of those rewards?

3:17:37.200 --> 3:17:40.360
 What's the meaning of life and this existence?

3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:44.600
 What's, what's the why of biology?

3:17:44.600 --> 3:17:45.600
 What does it want from us?

3:17:45.600 --> 3:17:50.200
 Why are all these cells very busy putting together an organism that seems to want to

3:17:50.200 --> 3:17:56.960
 just be in a hurry to do stuff and survive, but it also just doesn't, it's not happening

3:17:56.960 --> 3:17:57.960
 being survived.

3:17:57.960 --> 3:17:59.320
 Like I said, it's curious.

3:17:59.320 --> 3:18:01.720
 It keeps wanting to get into more trouble.

3:18:01.720 --> 3:18:02.720
 Why?

3:18:02.720 --> 3:18:03.720
 Yeah.

3:18:03.720 --> 3:18:06.920
 That, you know, that we're clearly designed for that, right?

3:18:06.920 --> 3:18:11.520
 This is, we're clearly designed to ask why and to answer.

3:18:11.520 --> 3:18:15.280
 And that I think is, I don't know the meaning of all life.

3:18:15.280 --> 3:18:21.200
 I think a meaning of our lives is that, and you know, this is the Aristotelian, you know,

3:18:21.200 --> 3:18:22.200
 happiness.

3:18:22.200 --> 3:18:26.440
 This is, an organism is happy and animals happy if it's performing to its design, right?

3:18:26.440 --> 3:18:29.920
 If it's doing what it was made for.

3:18:29.920 --> 3:18:30.920
 Yeah.

3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:31.920
 Well, you have to finish.

3:18:31.920 --> 3:18:34.160
 What's the design?

3:18:34.160 --> 3:18:43.680
 And, you know, who is the designer and what were they up to and how hard is it?

3:18:43.680 --> 3:18:45.280
 Do you have to build the whole universe?

3:18:45.280 --> 3:18:48.000
 And does the design even know what the hell they're doing?

3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:56.680
 Because, you know, maybe the designer built humus to find out about themselves.

3:18:56.680 --> 3:18:57.680
 That's what I would do.

3:18:57.680 --> 3:19:03.160
 Like if I had the power to build clones, I'll build a lot of clones and I'll get them to

3:19:03.160 --> 3:19:10.040
 different trouble to understand, like, what am I designed, what's this body designed to

3:19:10.040 --> 3:19:11.040
 do?

3:19:11.040 --> 3:19:12.040
 How far can I go that way?

3:19:12.040 --> 3:19:13.040
 Exactly.

3:19:13.040 --> 3:19:18.000
 And then, and I dissociate myself completely from having any way to know, like that I know

3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:19.000
 that person.

3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:20.000
 That's good.

3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:25.080
 I mean, I suppose you could do that in a single person's body by dissociation.

3:19:25.080 --> 3:19:33.200
 You could, yeah, why, but I do wonder what if you, if you look at earth as a collection

3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:40.840
 of humans, as a collection of biological organisms, it seems that we're busy doing something.

3:19:40.840 --> 3:19:51.720
 And it just seems too beautiful and too special to be a random, a random experiment.

3:19:51.720 --> 3:20:01.520
 It seems like it's an experiment that's cleverly designed by some forces of nature that are

3:20:01.520 --> 3:20:03.840
 beyond our current understanding.

3:20:03.840 --> 3:20:06.480
 And maybe that's part of our design is to keep asking why.

3:20:06.480 --> 3:20:07.480
 I said answer.

3:20:07.480 --> 3:20:11.760
 I'm not sure that's part of the design, the answer.

3:20:11.760 --> 3:20:17.720
 I think we're given just the sufficiently limited cognitive capability that we know

3:20:17.720 --> 3:20:24.280
 how to long to find the answer and we lack the ability to find the answer.

3:20:24.280 --> 3:20:26.120
 That's basically a summary of your career.

3:20:26.120 --> 3:20:27.880
 No, I'm just kidding.

3:20:27.880 --> 3:20:33.040
 And then we give each other Nobel prizes for, for having even an inkling of a good step

3:20:33.040 --> 3:20:34.600
 towards the right direction.

3:20:34.600 --> 3:20:38.520
 Carl, you're an incredible human being.

3:20:38.520 --> 3:20:42.720
 I'm a huge fan of who you are as a person, who you are as a scientist, who you are as

3:20:42.720 --> 3:20:43.720
 a writer.

3:20:43.720 --> 3:20:45.280
 I just thank you so much.

3:20:45.280 --> 3:20:47.960
 I'm so honored that you would sit down and talk to me today.

3:20:47.960 --> 3:20:48.960
 It was amazing.

3:20:48.960 --> 3:20:49.960
 It's been incredibly fun.

3:20:49.960 --> 3:20:50.960
 Let's do it again sometime.

3:20:50.960 --> 3:20:51.960
 Let's do it again.

3:20:51.960 --> 3:20:52.960
 It's been really great.

3:20:52.960 --> 3:20:57.960
 Your, your insights and wit and, and modesty are, are really quite rewarding.

3:20:57.960 --> 3:21:00.680
 Thanks so much, man.

3:21:00.680 --> 3:21:03.200
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Carl Diceroth.

3:21:03.200 --> 3:21:07.600
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:21:07.600 --> 3:21:11.000
 And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung.

3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:17.360
 Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of other people.

3:21:17.360 --> 3:21:41.720
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
