00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
 The following is a conversation with Michio Kaku.

00:02.800 --> 00:06.040
 He's a theoretical physicist, futurist, and professor

00:06.040 --> 00:08.400
 at the City College of New York.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.760
 He's the author of many fascinating books

00:10.760 --> 00:12.840
 that explore the nature of our reality

00:12.840 --> 00:15.520
 and the future of our civilization.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.200
 They include Einstein's Cosmos, Physics of the Impossible,

00:19.200 --> 00:21.600
 Future of the Mind, Parallel Worlds,

00:21.600 --> 00:24.240
 and his latest, The Future of Humanity,

00:24.240 --> 00:26.640
 terraforming Mars interstellar travel,

00:26.640 --> 00:29.960
 immortality, and our destiny beyond Earth.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.960
 I think it's beautiful and important

00:32.960 --> 00:35.760
 when a scientific mind can fearlessly explore

00:35.760 --> 00:37.600
 through conversation subjects

00:37.600 --> 00:40.200
 just outside of our understanding.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.440
 That, to me, is where artificial intelligence is today,

00:43.440 --> 00:45.680
 just outside of our understanding,

00:45.680 --> 00:47.440
 a place we have to reach for

00:47.440 --> 00:50.160
 if we're to uncover the mysteries of the human mind

00:50.160 --> 00:53.880
 and build human level and superhuman level AI systems

00:53.880 --> 00:56.640
 that transform our world for the better.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.240
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.600
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:01.600 --> 01:04.640

01:04.640 --> 01:06.640
 or simply connect with me on Twitter.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.920
 Alex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.680
 And now, here's my conversation with Michio Kaku.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.360
 You've mentioned that we just might make contact

01:17.360 --> 01:21.720
 with aliens or at least hear from them within this century.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.960
 Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism?

01:25.880 --> 01:28.120
 Well, this is pure speculation, of course.

01:28.120 --> 01:28.960
 Of course.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.280
 Even the fact that we've already identified

01:31.280 --> 01:34.760
 4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars,

01:34.760 --> 01:37.600
 and we have a census of the Milky Way Galaxy

01:37.600 --> 01:39.200
 for the first time,

01:39.200 --> 01:43.600
 we know that on average, every single star, on average,

01:43.600 --> 01:45.680
 has a planet going around it,

01:45.680 --> 01:47.760
 and about one fifth or so of them

01:47.760 --> 01:51.280
 have Earth sized planets going around them.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.000
 So just do the math.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.200
 We're talking about out of 100 billion stars

01:56.200 --> 01:58.200
 in the Milky Way Galaxy.

01:58.200 --> 02:02.960
 We're talking about billions of potential Earth sized planets.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.800
 And to believe that we're the only one

02:05.800 --> 02:09.200
 is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.640
 And how many galaxies are there?

02:11.640 --> 02:14.600
 Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope,

02:14.600 --> 02:17.920
 there are about 100 billion galaxies.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.720
 So do the math.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.520
 How many stars are there in the visible universe?

02:22.520 --> 02:25.960
 100 billion galaxies times

02:25.960 --> 02:29.400
 100 billion stars per galaxy.

02:29.400 --> 02:33.800
 We're talking about a number beyond human imagination.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.520
 And to believe that we're the only ones,

02:35.520 --> 02:38.240
 I think, is rather ridiculous.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.200
 So you've talked about different types of,

02:42.200 --> 02:44.520
 type zero, one, two, three, four, and five,

02:44.520 --> 02:47.240
 even of the Kardashev scale,

02:47.240 --> 02:49.440
 of the different kinds of civilizations.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.840
 What do you think it takes

02:52.840 --> 02:54.680
 if it is indeed a ridiculous notion

02:54.680 --> 02:56.280
 that we're alone in the universe?

02:56.280 --> 02:58.800
 What do you think it takes to reach out,

02:58.800 --> 03:02.720
 first to reach out through communication and connect?

03:02.720 --> 03:04.400
 Well, first of all, we have to understand

03:04.400 --> 03:08.800
 the level of sophistication of an alien life form

03:08.800 --> 03:10.560
 if we may contact with them.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.120
 I think in this century,

03:12.120 --> 03:14.200
 we'll probably pick up signals,

03:14.200 --> 03:17.440
 signals from an extraterrestrial civilization.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.320
 We'll pick up there, I love Lucy,

03:19.320 --> 03:21.320
 and there leave it to Beaver.

03:21.320 --> 03:25.600
 These ordinary day to day transmissions that they emit.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.240
 And the first thing we wanna do is to A,

03:28.240 --> 03:30.280
 decipher their language, of course,

03:30.280 --> 03:33.360
 but B, figure out at what level

03:33.360 --> 03:37.120
 they are advanced on the Kardashev scale.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.600
 I'm a physicist.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.040
 We rank things by two parameters,

03:41.040 --> 03:43.680
 energy and information.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.640
 That's how we rank black holes.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.360
 That's how we rank stars.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.640
 That's how we rank civilizations and outer space.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.920
 So a type one civilization is capable

03:54.920 --> 03:57.560
 of harnessing planetary power.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.000
 They control the weather, for example,

04:00.000 --> 04:01.320
 earthquakes, volcanoes.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.640
 They can modify the course of geologic events,

04:04.640 --> 04:08.440
 sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.

04:08.440 --> 04:11.160
 Type two would be stellar.

04:12.280 --> 04:15.680
 They play with stars, entire stars.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.480
 They use the entire energy output of a star,

04:18.480 --> 04:20.600
 sort of like Star Trek.

04:20.600 --> 04:24.680
 The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars.

04:24.680 --> 04:29.120
 So a type two would be somewhat similar to Star Trek.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.720
 Type three would be galactic.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.880
 They roamed the galactic space lanes.

04:33.880 --> 04:37.720
 And type three would be like Star Wars,

04:37.720 --> 04:39.920
 a galactic civilization.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.360
 Then one day I was giving this talk in London

04:42.360 --> 04:43.920
 at the planetarium there,

04:43.920 --> 04:46.040
 and the little boy comes up to me and he says,

04:46.040 --> 04:50.960
 Professor, you're wrong, you're wrong, this type four.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.280
 And I told him, look kid,

04:53.280 --> 04:56.920
 there are planets, stars, and galaxies.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.640
 That's it folks.

04:58.640 --> 05:02.600
 And he kept persisting and saying, no, this type four,

05:02.600 --> 05:05.680
 the power of the continuum.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.480
 And I thought about it for a moment.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.520
 And I said to myself,

05:08.520 --> 05:12.160
 is there an extra galactic source of energy,

05:12.160 --> 05:14.440
 the continuum of Star Trek?

05:14.440 --> 05:16.200
 And the answer is yes.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.000
 There could be a type four.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.960
 And that's dark energy.

05:19.960 --> 05:24.960
 We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe

05:25.400 --> 05:27.480
 is dark energy.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.560
 Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so,

05:30.560 --> 05:32.960
 and we only represent 4%.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.560
 We're the oddballs.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.320
 And so you begin to realize that, yeah,

05:36.320 --> 05:39.680
 there could be type four, maybe even type five.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.080
 So type four, you're saying,

05:42.080 --> 05:45.320
 being able to harness sort of like dark energy,

05:45.320 --> 05:47.080
 something that permeates the entire universe.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.960
 So be able to plug into the entire universe

05:50.960 --> 05:52.040
 as a source of energy.

05:52.040 --> 05:52.880
 That's right.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.640
 And dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang.

05:55.640 --> 05:58.880
 It's why the galaxies are being pushed apart.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.680
 It's the energy of nothing.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.480
 The more nothing you have,

06:02.480 --> 06:05.360
 the more dark energy that's repulsive.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.040
 And so the acceleration of the universe

06:08.040 --> 06:10.680
 is accelerating because the more you have,

06:10.680 --> 06:12.600
 the more you can have.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.320
 And that, of course, is by definition

06:14.320 --> 06:15.720
 an exponential curve.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.600
 It's called the decider expansion.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.400
 And that's the current state of the universe.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.840
 And then type five,

06:22.800 --> 06:27.800
 would that be able to seek energy sources somehow

06:28.960 --> 06:30.960
 outside of our universe?

06:30.960 --> 06:32.920
 And how crazy is that idea?

06:32.920 --> 06:35.320
 Yeah, type five will be the multiverse.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.240
 Multiverse, okay.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.680
 I'm a quantum physicist,

06:37.680 --> 06:40.200
 and we quantum physicists don't believe

06:40.200 --> 06:42.080
 that the Big Bang happened once.

06:42.080 --> 06:45.080
 That would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.840
 And that means that there could be multiple bangs

06:47.840 --> 06:49.320
 happening all the time.

06:49.320 --> 06:52.080
 Even as we speak today,

06:52.080 --> 06:54.280
 universes are being created.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.120
 And that fits the data.

06:56.120 --> 06:59.920
 The inflationary universe is a quantum theory.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.000
 So there's a certain finite probability

07:02.000 --> 07:05.120
 that universes are being created all the time.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.720
 And for me, this is actually rather aesthetically pleasing

07:08.720 --> 07:13.200
 because, you know, I was raised as a Presbyterian,

07:13.200 --> 07:15.920
 but my parents were Buddhists.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.520
 And there's two diametrically opposed ideas

07:19.520 --> 07:21.080
 about the universe.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.240
 In Buddhism, there's only Nirvana.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.160
 There's no beginning, there's no end,

07:25.160 --> 07:26.920
 there's only timelessness.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.960
 But in Christianity, there is the instant

07:29.960 --> 07:32.720
 when God said, let there be life.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.320
 In other words, an instant of creation.

07:35.320 --> 07:40.200
 So I've had these two mutually exclusive ideas in my head.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.880
 And I now realize that it's possible

07:41.880 --> 07:44.040
 to meld them into a single theory.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.640
 Either the universe had a beginning or it didn't, right?

07:48.640 --> 07:49.920
 Wrong.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.160
 You see, our universe had a beginning.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.480
 Our universe had an instant where somebody

07:55.480 --> 07:57.880
 might have said, let there be life.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.320
 But there are other bubble universes out there

08:00.320 --> 08:02.720
 in a bubble bath of universes.

08:02.720 --> 08:07.320
 And that means that these universes are expanding

08:07.320 --> 08:11.280
 into a dimension beyond our three dimensional comprehension.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.120
 In other words, hyperspace.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.400
 In other words, 11 dimensional hyperspace.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.520
 So Nirvana would be this timeless

08:19.520 --> 08:21.720
 11 dimensional hyperspace

08:21.720 --> 08:24.880
 where big bangs are happening all the time.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.680
 So we can now combine two mutually exclusive theories

08:28.680 --> 08:29.680
 of creation.

08:29.680 --> 08:34.680
 And Stephen Hawking, for example, even in his last book,

08:34.680 --> 08:36.680
 even said that this is an argument

08:36.680 --> 08:38.680
 against the existence of God.

08:38.680 --> 08:41.680
 He said there is no God because there was not enough time

08:41.680 --> 08:43.680
 for God to create the universe

08:43.680 --> 08:46.680
 because the big bang happened in an instant of time.

08:46.680 --> 08:49.680
 Therefore, there was no time available

08:49.680 --> 08:51.680
 for him to create the universe.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.680
 But you see, the multiverse idea means

08:54.680 --> 08:57.680
 that there was a time before time.

08:57.680 --> 09:01.680
 And there are multiple times each bubble has its own time.

09:01.680 --> 09:05.680
 And so it means that there could actually be a universe

09:05.680 --> 09:08.680
 before the beginning of our universe.

09:08.680 --> 09:12.680
 So if you think of a bubble bath, when two bubbles collide

09:12.680 --> 09:16.680
 or when two bubbles fission to create a baby bubble,

09:16.680 --> 09:18.680
 that's called the big bang.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.680
 So the big bang is nothing but the collision of universes

09:21.680 --> 09:23.680
 or the budding of universes.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.680
 This is a beautiful picture of our incredibly mysterious

09:26.680 --> 09:27.680
 existence.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.680
 So is that humbling to you?

09:29.680 --> 09:30.680
 Exciting?

09:30.680 --> 09:32.680
 The idea of multiverses?

09:32.680 --> 09:36.680
 I don't even know how to even begin to wrap my mind around it.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.680
 Well, it's exciting for me because what I do for a living

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
 is string theory.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.680
 That's my day job.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.680
 I get paid by the city of New York to work on string theory.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.680
 Yes.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.680
 And you see, string theory is a multiverse theory.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.680
 So people say, first of all, what is string theory?

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
 Yes.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.680
 So string theory simply says that all the particles we see in

09:56.680 --> 09:59.680
 nature, the electron, the proton, the quarks, what have you,

09:59.680 --> 10:03.680
 are nothing but vibrations on a musical string,

10:03.680 --> 10:05.680
 on a tiny, tiny little string.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.680
 You know, G. Robert Oppenheimer, the creator of the atomic bomb,

10:09.680 --> 10:13.680
 was so frustrated in the 1950s with all these subatomic

10:13.680 --> 10:18.680
 particles being created in our atom smashers that he announced,

10:18.680 --> 10:22.680
 he announced one day that the Nobel Prize in physics

10:22.680 --> 10:26.680
 should go to the physicist who does not discover a new particle

10:26.680 --> 10:27.680
 that year.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.680
 Well, today we think there are nothing but musical notes on

10:30.680 --> 10:32.680
 these tiny little vibrating strings.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.680
 So what is physics?

10:34.680 --> 10:38.680
 Physics is the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.680
 What is chemistry?

10:39.680 --> 10:44.680
 Chemistry is the melodies you can play on these strings.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.680
 What is the universe?

10:46.680 --> 10:49.680
 The universe is a symphony of strings.

10:49.680 --> 10:54.680
 And then what is the mind of God that Albert Einstein so eloquently

10:54.680 --> 10:57.680
 wrote about for the last 30 years of his life?

10:57.680 --> 11:03.680
 The mind of God would be cosmic music resonating through

11:03.680 --> 11:05.680
 11 dimensional hyperspace.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.680
 So beautifully put.

11:06.680 --> 11:11.680
 What do you think is the mind of Einstein's God?

11:11.680 --> 11:16.680
 Do you think there's a why that we could untangle from this

11:16.680 --> 11:19.680
 universe of strings?

11:19.680 --> 11:20.680
 Why are we here?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.680
 What is the meaning of it all?

11:22.680 --> 11:26.680
 Well, Stephen Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize, once said

11:26.680 --> 11:30.680
 that the more we learn about the universe, the more we learn that

11:30.680 --> 11:32.680
 it's pointless.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.680
 Well, I don't know.

11:34.680 --> 11:38.680
 I don't profess to understand the great secrets of the universe.

11:38.680 --> 11:42.680
 However, let me say two things about what the giants of physics

11:42.680 --> 11:44.680
 have said about this question.

11:44.680 --> 11:48.680
 Einstein believed in two types of God.

11:48.680 --> 11:54.680
 One was the God of the Bible, the personal God, the God that

11:54.680 --> 11:58.680
 answers prayers, walks on water, performs miracles, smites the

11:58.680 --> 11:59.680
 Philistines.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.680
 That's the personal God that he didn't believe in.

12:02.680 --> 12:07.680
 He believed in the God of Spinoza, the God of order, simplicity,

12:07.680 --> 12:09.680
 harmony, beauty.

12:09.680 --> 12:12.680
 The universe could have been ugly.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.680
 The universe could have been messy, random.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.680
 But it's gorgeous.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.680
 It relates on a single sheet of paper.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.680
 We can write down all the known laws of the universe.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.680
 It's amazing.

12:23.680 --> 12:27.680
 On one sheet of paper, Einstein's equation is one inch long.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.680
 Strength theory is a lot longer and so is the standard model.

12:31.680 --> 12:36.680
 But you could put all these equations on one sheet of paper.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.680
 It didn't have to be that way.

12:38.680 --> 12:39.680
 It could have been messy.

12:39.680 --> 12:43.680
 And so Einstein thought of himself as a young boy entering this

12:43.680 --> 12:49.680
 huge library for the first time, being overwhelmed by the

12:49.680 --> 12:52.680
 simplicity, elegance, and beauty of this library.

12:52.680 --> 12:57.680
 But all he could do was read the first page of the first volume.

12:57.680 --> 13:01.680
 Well, that library is the universe with all sorts of mysterious

13:01.680 --> 13:04.680
 magical things that we have yet to find.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.680
 And then Galileo was asked about this.

13:07.680 --> 13:14.680
 Galileo said that the purpose of science, the purpose of science

13:14.680 --> 13:17.680
 is to determine how the heavens go.

13:17.680 --> 13:23.680
 The purpose of religion is to determine how to go to heaven.

13:23.680 --> 13:27.680
 So in other words, science is about natural law.

13:27.680 --> 13:31.680
 And religion is about ethics, how to be a good person,

13:31.680 --> 13:33.680
 how to go to heaven.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.680
 As long as we keep these two things apart, we're in great shape.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.680
 The problem occurs when people from the natural sciences

13:41.680 --> 13:45.680
 begin to pontificate about ethics and people from religion

13:45.680 --> 13:48.680
 begin to pontificate about natural law.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.680
 That's where we get into big trouble.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.680
 You think they're fundamentally distinct, morality and ethics

13:54.680 --> 13:59.680
 and our idea of what is right and what is wrong.

13:59.680 --> 14:03.680
 That's something that's outside the reach of strength theory and physics.

14:03.680 --> 14:04.680
 That's right.

14:04.680 --> 14:09.680
 If you talk to a squirrel about what is right and what is wrong,

14:09.680 --> 14:13.680
 there's no reference frame for a squirrel.

14:13.680 --> 14:18.680
 And realize that aliens from out of space, if they ever come visit us,

14:18.680 --> 14:22.680
 they'll try to talk to us like we talk to squirrels in the forest,

14:22.680 --> 14:25.680
 but eventually we get bored talking to the squirrels

14:25.680 --> 14:27.680
 because they don't talk back to us.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.680
 Same thing with aliens from out of space.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.680
 When they come down to Earth, they'll be curious about us to a degree,

14:32.680 --> 14:37.680
 but after a while they just get bored because we have nothing to offer them.

14:37.680 --> 14:42.680
 So our sense of right and wrong, what does that mean compared to a squirrel's

14:42.680 --> 14:45.680
 sense of right and wrong?

14:45.680 --> 14:51.680
 Now we, of course, do have an ethics that keeps civilizations in line,

14:51.680 --> 14:56.680
 enriches our life and makes civilization possible.

14:56.680 --> 15:01.680
 I think that's a good thing, but it's not mandated by a law of physics.

15:01.680 --> 15:06.680
 So if aliens do, alien species were to make contact,

15:06.680 --> 15:10.680
 forgive me for staying on aliens for a bit longer,

15:10.680 --> 15:16.680
 do you think they're more likely to be friendly, to befriend us,

15:16.680 --> 15:18.680
 or to destroy us?

15:18.680 --> 15:22.680
 Well, I think for the most part, they'll pretty much ignore us.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.680
 If you were a deer in the forest, who do you fear the most?

15:25.680 --> 15:29.680
 Do you fear the hunter with his gigantic 16 gauge shotgun?

15:29.680 --> 15:34.680
 Or do you fear the guy with the briefcase and glasses?

15:34.680 --> 15:38.680
 Well, the guy with the briefcase could be a developer,

15:38.680 --> 15:43.680
 about to basically flatten the entire forest, destroying your livelihood.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.680
 So instinctively, you may be afraid of the hunter,

15:47.680 --> 15:53.680
 but actually the problem with deers in the forest is that they should fear developers,

15:53.680 --> 15:58.680
 because developers look at deer as simply getting in the way.

15:58.680 --> 16:04.680
 I mean, in World of the Worlds by H.G. Wells, the aliens did not hate us.

16:04.680 --> 16:10.680
 If you read the book, the aliens did not have evil intentions toward homo sapiens.

16:10.680 --> 16:13.680
 No, we were in the way.

16:13.680 --> 16:21.680
 So I think we have to realize that alien civilizations may view us quite differently than in science fiction novels.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.680
 However, I personally believe, and I cannot prove any of this,

16:25.680 --> 16:28.680
 I personally believe that they're probably going to be peaceful,

16:28.680 --> 16:32.680
 because there's nothing that they want from our world.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.680
 I mean, what are they going to take us?

16:34.680 --> 16:36.680
 What are they going to take us for? Gold?

16:36.680 --> 16:40.680
 No, gold is a useless metal for the most part.

16:40.680 --> 16:45.680
 It's silver, I mean, it's gold in color, but that only affects homo sapiens.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.680
 Squirrels don't care about gold.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.680
 And so gold is a rather useless element.

16:50.680 --> 16:54.680
 Rare earths maybe, platinum based elements, rare earths for their electronics.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.680
 Yeah, maybe.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.680
 But other than that, we have nothing to offer them.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.680
 I mean, think about it for a moment.

17:01.680 --> 17:06.680
 People love Shakespeare and they love the arts and poetry,

17:06.680 --> 17:11.680
 but outside of the earth, they mean nothing, absolutely nothing.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.680
 I mean, when I write down an equation in string theory,

17:15.680 --> 17:19.680
 I would hope that on the other side of the galaxy,

17:19.680 --> 17:24.680
 there's an alien writing down that very same equation in different notation,

17:24.680 --> 17:29.680
 but that alien on the other side of the galaxy, Shakespeare, poetry, Hemingway,

17:29.680 --> 17:34.680
 it would mean nothing to him or her or it.

17:34.680 --> 17:39.680
 When you think about entities that's out there, extraterrestrial,

17:39.680 --> 17:47.680
 do you think they would naturally look something that even is recognizable to us as life?

17:47.680 --> 17:50.680
 Or would they be radically different?

17:50.680 --> 17:52.680
 Well, how did we become intelligent?

17:52.680 --> 17:55.680
 Basically, three things made us intelligent.

17:55.680 --> 17:58.680
 One is our eyesight, stereo eyesight.

17:58.680 --> 18:03.680
 We have the eyes of a hunter, stereo vision, so we lock in on targets.

18:03.680 --> 18:08.680
 And who is smarter? Predator or prey?

18:08.680 --> 18:11.680
 Predators are smarter than prey.

18:11.680 --> 18:14.680
 They have their eyes at the front of their face, like lions, tigers,

18:14.680 --> 18:18.680
 while rabbits have eyes to the side of their face.

18:18.680 --> 18:22.680
 Why is that? Hunters have to zero in on the target.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.680
 They have to know how to ambush.

18:24.680 --> 18:29.680
 They have to know how to hide, camouflage, sneak up, stealth, deceit.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.680
 That takes a lot of intelligence.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.680
 Rabbits, all they have to do is run.

18:34.680 --> 18:39.680
 So that's the first criterion, stereo eyesight of some sort.

18:39.680 --> 18:45.680
 Second is the thumb. The opposable thumb of some sort could be a claw or a tentacle.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.680
 So hand eye coordination.

18:48.680 --> 18:52.680
 Hand eye coordination is the way we manipulate the environment.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.680
 And then three, language.

18:54.680 --> 18:59.680
 Because, you know, mama bear never tells baby bear to avoid the human hunter.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.680
 Bears just learn by themselves.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.680
 They never hand out information from one generation to the next.

19:05.680 --> 19:09.680
 So these are the three basic ingredients of intelligence.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.680
 Eye sight of some sort.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.680
 An opposable thumb or tentacle or claw of some sort.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.680
 And language.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.680
 Now ask yourself a simple question.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.680
 How many animals have all three?

19:21.680 --> 19:23.680
 Just us.

19:23.680 --> 19:24.680
 It's just us.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.680
 I mean, the primates, they have a language.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.680
 Yeah, they may get up to maybe 20 words.

19:30.680 --> 19:34.680
 But a baby learns a word a day, several words a day a baby learns.

19:34.680 --> 19:40.680
 And a typical adult knows about almost 5,000 words.

19:40.680 --> 19:46.680
 Well, the maximum number of words that you can teach a gorilla in any language,

19:46.680 --> 19:49.680
 including their own language, is about 20 or so.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.680
 And so we see the difference in intelligence.

19:52.680 --> 20:00.680
 So when we meet aliens from outer space, chances are they will have been descended from predators of some sort.

20:00.680 --> 20:07.680
 They'll have some way to manipulate the environment and communicate their knowledge to the next generation.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.680
 That's it, folks.

20:08.680 --> 20:12.680
 So functionally, that would be similar.

20:12.680 --> 20:15.680
 We would be able to recognize them.

20:15.680 --> 20:19.680
 Well, not necessarily, because I think even with homo sapiens,

20:19.680 --> 20:27.680
 we are eventually going to perhaps become part cybernetic and genetically enhanced.

20:27.680 --> 20:31.680
 Already, robots are getting smarter and smarter.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.680
 Right now, robots have the intelligence of a cockroach.

20:35.680 --> 20:40.680
 But in the coming years, our robots will be as smart as a mouse,

20:40.680 --> 20:42.680
 then maybe as smart as a rabbit.

20:42.680 --> 20:47.680
 If we're lucky, maybe as smart as a cat or a dog.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.680
 And by the end of the century, who knows for sure,

20:50.680 --> 20:53.680
 our robots will be probably as smart as a monkey.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.680
 Now, at that point, of course, they could be dangerous.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.680
 You see, monkeys are self aware.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.680
 They know they are monkeys.

21:02.680 --> 21:05.680
 They may have a different agenda than us.

21:05.680 --> 21:09.680
 While dogs, dogs are confused.

21:09.680 --> 21:15.680
 You see, dogs think that we are a dog, that we're the top dog.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.680
 They're the underdog.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.680
 That's why they whimper and follow us and lick us all the time.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.680
 We're the top dog.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.680
 Monkeys have no illusion at all.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.680
 We know we are not monkeys.

21:28.680 --> 21:31.680
 And so I think that in the future, we'll have to put a chip in their brain

21:31.680 --> 21:35.680
 to shut them off once our robots have murderous thoughts.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.680
 But that's in 100 years.

21:37.680 --> 21:44.680
 In 200 years, the robots will be smart enough to remove that failsafe chip in their brain

21:44.680 --> 21:46.680
 and then watch out.

21:46.680 --> 21:52.680
 At that point, I think rather than compete with our robots,

21:52.680 --> 21:54.680
 we should merge with them.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.680
 We should become part cybernetic.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.680
 So I think when we meet alien life from outer space,

21:59.680 --> 22:04.680
 they may be genetically and cybernetically enhanced.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.680
 Genetically and cybernetically enhanced.

22:07.680 --> 22:08.680
 Wow.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.680
 So let's talk about that full range.

22:10.680 --> 22:13.680
 In the near term and 200 years from now,

22:13.680 --> 22:18.680
 how promising in the near term in your view is brain machine interfaces.

22:18.680 --> 22:26.680
 So starting to allow computers to talk directly to the brains, Elon Musk has worked on that with Neuralink

22:26.680 --> 22:28.680
 and there's other companies working on this idea.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.680
 Do you see promise there?

22:30.680 --> 22:32.680
 Do you see hope for near term impact?

22:32.680 --> 22:35.680
 Well, every technology has pluses and minuses.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.680
 Already we can record memories.

22:38.680 --> 22:42.680
 I have a book, The Future of the Mind, where I detail some of these breakthroughs.

22:42.680 --> 22:48.680
 We can now record simple memories of mice and send these memories on the internet.

22:48.680 --> 22:55.680
 Eventually, we're going to do this with primates at Wake Forest University and also in Los Angeles.

22:55.680 --> 23:00.680
 And then after that, we'll have a memory chip for Alzheimer's patients.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.680
 We'll test it out at Alzheimer's patients because of course,

23:03.680 --> 23:07.680
 when Alzheimer's patients lose their memory, they wander.

23:07.680 --> 23:15.680
 They create all sorts of havoc wandering around oblivious to their surroundings and they'll have a chip.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.680
 They'll push the button and memories.

23:17.680 --> 23:25.680
 Memories will come flooding into their hippocampus and the chip telling them where they live and who they are.

23:25.680 --> 23:32.680
 And so a memory chip is definitely in the cards and I think this will eventually affect human civilization.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.680
 What is the future of the internet?

23:34.680 --> 23:36.680
 The future of the internet is brainnet.

23:36.680 --> 23:43.680
 Brainnet is when we send emotions, feelings, sensations on the internet.

23:43.680 --> 23:48.680
 And we will telepathically communicate with other humans this way.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.680
 This is going to affect everything.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.680
 Look at entertainment.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.680
 Remember the silent movies?

23:53.680 --> 23:57.680
 Charlie Chaplin was very famous during the era of silent movies.

23:57.680 --> 24:04.680
 But when the talkies came in, nobody wanted to see Charlie Chaplin anymore because he never talked in the movies.

24:04.680 --> 24:10.680
 And so a whole generation of actors lost their job and a new series of actors came in.

24:10.680 --> 24:16.680
 Next, we're going to have the movies replaced by brainnet.

24:16.680 --> 24:22.680
 Because in the future, people will say, who wants to see a screen with images?

24:22.680 --> 24:23.680
 That's it.

24:23.680 --> 24:26.680
 Sound and image, that's called the movies.

24:26.680 --> 24:33.680
 In our entertainment industry, this multi billion dollar industry is based on screens with moving images.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.680
 And sound.

24:34.680 --> 24:42.680
 But what happens when emotions, feelings, sensations, memories can be conveyed on the internet?

24:42.680 --> 24:44.680
 It's going to change everything.

24:44.680 --> 24:49.680
 Human relations will change because you'll be able to empathize and feel the suffering of other people.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.680
 We'll be able to communicate telepathically.

24:52.680 --> 24:55.680
 And this is coming.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.680
 You described brainnet in the future of the mind.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.680
 This is an interesting concept.

25:00.680 --> 25:07.680
 Do you think, as you mentioned, entertainment, what kind of effect would it have on our personal relationships?

25:07.680 --> 25:09.680
 Hopefully, it will deepen it.

25:09.680 --> 25:21.680
 You realize that for most of human history, for over 90% of human history, we only knew maybe 20, 100 people.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.680
 That's it, folks.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.680
 That was your tribe.

25:24.680 --> 25:31.680
 That was everybody you knew in the universe was only maybe 50 or 100.

25:31.680 --> 25:37.680
 With the coming of towns, of course, it expanded to a few thousand, with the coming of the telephone,

25:37.680 --> 25:41.680
 all of a sudden, you could reach thousands of people with the telephone.

25:41.680 --> 25:45.680
 And now with the internet, you can reach the entire population of the planet Earth.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.680
 And so I think this is a normal progression.

25:48.680 --> 25:58.680
 And you think that kind of connection to the rest of the world, and then adding sensations like being able to share telepathically, emotions, and so on,

25:58.680 --> 26:02.680
 that would just further deepen our connection to our fellow humans.

26:02.680 --> 26:03.680
 Yeah, that's right.

26:03.680 --> 26:07.680
 In fact, I disagree with many scientists on this question.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.680
 Most scientists would say that technology is neutral.

26:10.680 --> 26:15.680
 A double edged sword, one side of the sword can cut against people.

26:15.680 --> 26:20.680
 The other side of the sword can cut against ignorance and disease.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.680
 I disagree.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.680
 I think technology does have a moral direction.

26:25.680 --> 26:26.680
 Look at the internet.

26:26.680 --> 26:32.680
 The internet spreads knowledge, awareness, and that creates empowerment.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.680
 People act on knowledge.

26:34.680 --> 26:40.680
 When they begin to realize that they don't have to live that way, they don't have to suffer under a dictatorship,

26:40.680 --> 26:47.680
 that there are other ways of living under freedom, then they begin to take things, take power.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.680
 And that spreads democracy.

26:49.680 --> 26:53.680
 And democracies do not war with other democracies.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.680
 I'm a scientist.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.680
 I believe in data.

26:56.680 --> 27:05.680
 So let's take a sheet of paper and write down every single war you had to learn since you were in elementary school.

27:05.680 --> 27:14.680
 Every single war, hundreds of them, kings, queens, emperors, dictators, all these wars were between kings, queens, emperors, and dictators.

27:14.680 --> 27:19.680
 Never between two major democracies.

27:19.680 --> 27:25.680
 And so I think with the spread of this technology and which would accelerate with the coming of brainnet,

27:25.680 --> 27:28.680
 it means that, well, we will still have wars.

27:28.680 --> 27:34.680
 Wars, of course, is politics by other means, but there'll be less intense and less frequent.

27:34.680 --> 27:42.680
 Do you have worries of longer term existential risk from technology, from AI?

27:42.680 --> 27:50.680
 So I think that's a wonderful vision of a future where war is a distant memory.

27:50.680 --> 27:53.680
 But now there's another agent.

27:53.680 --> 28:00.680
 There's somebody else that's able to create conflict, that's able to create harm, AI systems.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.680
 So do you have worry about such AI systems?

28:02.680 --> 28:04.680
 Well, yes, that is an existential risk.

28:04.680 --> 28:08.680
 But again, I think an existential risk not for this century.

28:08.680 --> 28:19.680
 I think our grandkids are going to have to confront this question as robots gradually approach the intelligence of a dog, a cat, and finally that of a monkey.

28:19.680 --> 28:22.680
 However, I think we will digitize ourselves as well.

28:22.680 --> 28:29.680
 Not only are we going to merge with our technology, we'll also digitize our personality, our memories, our feelings.

28:29.680 --> 28:33.680
 You realize during the Middle Ages, there was something called dualism.

28:33.680 --> 28:37.680
 Dualism meant that the soul was separate from the body.

28:37.680 --> 28:40.680
 When the body died, the soul went to heaven.

28:40.680 --> 28:41.680
 That's dualism.

28:41.680 --> 28:46.680
 Then in the 20th century, neuroscience came in and said, bah, humbug.

28:46.680 --> 28:50.680
 Every time we look at the brain, it's just neurons.

28:50.680 --> 28:55.680
 That's it, folks, period, end of story, bunch of neurons firing.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.680
 Now we're going back to dualism.

28:58.680 --> 29:08.680
 Now we realize that we can digitize human memories, feelings, sensations, and create a digital copy of ourselves.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.680
 And that's called the connectome project.

29:10.680 --> 29:25.680
 Billions of dollars are now being spent to do not just the genome project of sequencing the genes of our body, but the connectome project, which is to map the entire connections of the human brain.

29:25.680 --> 29:39.680
 And even before then, already in Silicon Valley today, at this very moment, you can contact Silicon Valley companies that are willing to digitize your relatives because some people want to talk to their parents.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.680
 There are unresolved issues with their parents.

29:41.680 --> 29:48.680
 And one day, yes, berms will digitize people and you'll be able to talk to them a reasonable facsimile.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.680
 We leave a digital trail.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.680
 Our ancestors did not.

29:53.680 --> 30:03.680
 Our ancestors were lucky if they had one line, just one line in a church book saying the date they were baptized and the date they died.

30:03.680 --> 30:04.680
 That's it.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.680
 That was their entire digital memory.

30:07.680 --> 30:15.680
 I mean, their entire digital existence summarized in just a few letters of the alphabet, a whole life.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.680
 Now we digitize everything.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.680
 Every time you sneeze, you digitize it.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.680
 You put it on the internet.

30:21.680 --> 30:27.680
 And so I think that we are going to digitize ourselves and give us digital immortality.

30:27.680 --> 30:34.680
 We'll not only have biologic genetic immortality of some sort, but also digital immortality.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.680
 And what are we going to do with it?

30:36.680 --> 30:40.680
 I think we should send it into outer space.

30:40.680 --> 30:48.680
 If you digitize the human brain and put it on a laser beam and shoot it to the moon, you're on the moon in one second.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.680
 Shoot it to Mars. You run Mars in 20 minutes.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.680
 Shoot it to Pluto. You run Pluto in eight hours.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.680
 Think about it for a moment.

30:55.680 --> 31:01.680
 You can have breakfast in New York and for a morning snack, vacation on the moon.

31:01.680 --> 31:11.680
 Then zap your way to Mars by noon time, journey to the asteroid belt of the afternoon, and they come back for dinner in New York at night.

31:11.680 --> 31:15.680
 All in a day's work at the speed of light.

31:15.680 --> 31:19.680
 Now, this means that you don't need booster rockets.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.680
 You don't need weightlessness problems.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.680
 You don't need to worry about meteorites.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.680
 And what's on the moon?

31:24.680 --> 31:30.680
 On the moon, there is a mainframe that downloads your laser beams information.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.680
 And where does it download the information into?

31:33.680 --> 31:35.680
 An avatar.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.680
 And what does that avatar look like?

31:37.680 --> 31:40.680
 Anything you want.

31:40.680 --> 31:41.680
 Think about it for a moment.

31:41.680 --> 31:54.680
 You could be Superman, superwoman on the moon, on Mars, traveling throughout the universe at the speed of light, downloading your personality into any vehicle you want.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.680
 Now, let me stick my neck out.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.680
 So far, everything I've been saying is well within the laws of physics.

32:00.680 --> 32:01.680
 Well within the laws of physics.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.680
 Now, let me go outside the laws of physics.

32:04.680 --> 32:05.680
 Here we go.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.680
 I think this already exists.

32:07.680 --> 32:20.680
 I think outside the Earth, there could be a superhighway, a laser highway of laser porting with billions of souls of aliens zapping their way across the galaxy.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.680
 Now, let me ask you a question.

32:22.680 --> 32:27.680
 Are we smart enough to determine whether such a thing exists or not?

32:27.680 --> 32:28.680
 No.

32:28.680 --> 32:38.680
 This could exist right outside the orbit of the planet Earth, and we're too stupid in our technology to even prove it or disprove it.

32:38.680 --> 32:50.680
 We would need the aliens on this laser superhighway to help us out, to send us a human interpretable signal.

32:50.680 --> 32:57.680
 I mean, it ultimately boils down to the language of communication, but that's an exciting possibility that actually the sky is filled.

32:57.680 --> 33:04.680
 The aliens could already be here, and we're just so oblivious that we're too stupid to know it.

33:04.680 --> 33:09.680
 See, they don't have to be an alien form with little green men.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.680
 They could be in any form they want, in an avatar of their creation.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.680
 Well, in fact, they could very well be.

33:15.680 --> 33:16.680
 They could even look like us.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.680
 Exactly.

33:17.680 --> 33:18.680
 And we'd never know.

33:18.680 --> 33:20.680
 One of us could be an alien.

33:20.680 --> 33:25.680
 You know, in a zoo, did you know that we sometimes have zookeepers that imitate animals?

33:25.680 --> 33:32.680
 We create a fake animal, and we put it in so that the animal is not afraid of this fake animal.

33:32.680 --> 33:36.680
 And of course, these animals brains, their brain is about as big as a walnut.

33:36.680 --> 33:40.680
 They accept these dummies as if they were real.

33:40.680 --> 33:45.680
 So an alien civilization in outer space would say, oh yeah, human brains are so tiny.

33:45.680 --> 33:50.680
 We could put a dummy on their world, an avatar, and they'd never know it.

33:50.680 --> 33:54.680
 That would be an entertaining thing to watch from the alien perspective.

33:54.680 --> 34:01.680
 So you kind of implied that with the digital form of our being, but also biologically.

34:01.680 --> 34:06.680
 Do you think one day technology will allow individual human beings to become immortal,

34:06.680 --> 34:10.680
 besides just through the ability to digitize our essence?

34:10.680 --> 34:16.680
 Yeah, I think that artificial intelligence will give us the key to genetic immortality.

34:16.680 --> 34:20.680
 You see, in the coming decades, everyone's going to have their gene sequence.

34:20.680 --> 34:26.680
 We'll have billions of genomes of old people, billions of genomes of young people.

34:26.680 --> 34:27.680
 And what are we going to do with it?

34:27.680 --> 34:34.680
 We're going to run it through an AI machine, which has pattern recognition, to look for the age genes.

34:34.680 --> 34:41.680
 In other words, the fountain of youth that emperors, kings, and queens lusted over,

34:41.680 --> 34:45.680
 the fountain of youth will be found by artificial intelligence.

34:45.680 --> 34:51.680
 Artificial intelligence will identify where these age genes are located.

34:51.680 --> 34:53.680
 First of all, what is aging?

34:53.680 --> 34:55.680
 We now know what aging is.

34:55.680 --> 34:59.680
 Aging is the buildup of errors.

34:59.680 --> 35:03.680
 That's all aging is, the buildup of genetic errors.

35:03.680 --> 35:09.680
 This means that cells eventually become slower, sluggish, and they go into senescence, and they die.

35:09.680 --> 35:13.680
 In fact, that's why we die.

35:13.680 --> 35:20.680
 We die because of the buildup of mistakes in our genome, in our cellular activity.

35:20.680 --> 35:26.680
 But you see, in the future, we'll be able to fix those genes with CRISPR type technologies, and perhaps even live forever.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.680
 So let me ask you a question.

35:28.680 --> 35:31.680
 Where does aging take place in a car?

35:31.680 --> 35:34.680
 Given a car, where does aging take place?

35:34.680 --> 35:36.680
 Well, it's obvious, the engine, right?

35:36.680 --> 35:39.680
 A, that's where you have a lot of moving parts.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.680
 B, that's where you have combustion.

35:41.680 --> 35:46.680
 Well, where in the cell do we have combustion?

35:46.680 --> 35:48.680
 The mitochondria.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.680
 We now know where aging takes place.

35:51.680 --> 35:58.680
 And if we cure many of the mistakes that build up in the mitochondria of the cell, we could become immortal.

35:58.680 --> 36:05.680
 Let me ask you, if you yourself could become immortal, would you?

36:05.680 --> 36:08.680
 Damn straight.

36:08.680 --> 36:14.680
 No, I think about it for a while, because of course, it depends on how you become immortal.

36:14.680 --> 36:17.680
 You know, there's a famous myth of Tithonus.

36:17.680 --> 36:24.680
 It turns out that years ago, in the Greeks mythology, there was the saga of Tithonus and Aurora.

36:24.680 --> 36:31.680
 Aurora was the goddess of the dawn, and she fell in love with a mortal, a human called Tithonus.

36:31.680 --> 36:41.680
 And so Aurora begged, begged Zeus to grant her the gift of immortality to give to her lover.

36:41.680 --> 36:46.680
 So Zeus took pity on Aurora and made Tithonus immortal.

36:46.680 --> 36:51.680
 But you see, Aurora made a mistake, a huge mistake.

36:51.680 --> 36:57.680
 She asked for immortality, but she forgot to ask for eternal youth.

36:57.680 --> 37:08.680
 So poor Tithonus got older and older and older every year decrepit, a bag of bones, but he could never die, never die.

37:08.680 --> 37:10.680
 Quality of life is important.

37:10.680 --> 37:17.680
 So I think immortality is a great idea, as long as you also have immortal youth as well.

37:17.680 --> 37:26.680
 Now, I personally believe, and I cannot prove this, but I personally believe that our grandkids may have the option of reaching the age of 30 and then stopping.

37:26.680 --> 37:38.680
 They may like being age 30, because you have wisdom, you have all the benefits of age and maturity, and you still live forever with a healthy body.

37:38.680 --> 37:42.680
 Our descendants may like being 30 for several centuries.

37:42.680 --> 37:48.680
 Is there an aspect of human existence that is meaningful only because we're mortal?

37:48.680 --> 37:59.680
 Well, every waking moment, we don't think about it this way, but every waking moment, actually, we are aware of our death and our mortality.

37:59.680 --> 38:00.680
 Think about it for a moment.

38:00.680 --> 38:09.680
 When you go to college, you realize that you are in a period of time where soon you will reach middle age and have a career.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.680
 And after that, you'll retire and then you'll die.

38:12.680 --> 38:23.680
 And so even as a youth, even as a child, without even thinking about it, you are aware of your own death, because it sets limits to your lifespan.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.680
 I got to graduate from high school.

38:25.680 --> 38:27.680
 I got to graduate from college.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.680
 Why?

38:28.680 --> 38:38.680
 Because you're going to die, because unless you graduate from high school, unless you graduate from college, you're not going to enter old age with enough money to retire and then die.

38:38.680 --> 38:46.680
 And so, yeah, people think about it unconsciously because it affects every aspect of your being.

38:46.680 --> 38:55.680
 The fact that you go to high school, college, get married, have kids, there's a clock, a clock ticking even without your permission.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.680
 It gives a sense of urgency.

38:57.680 --> 39:07.680
 Do you, do you yourself, I mean, there's so much excitement and passion in the way you talk about physics and the way you talk about technology in the future.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.680
 Do you yourself meditate on your own mortality?

39:10.680 --> 39:13.680
 Do you think about this clock that's ticking?

39:13.680 --> 39:18.680
 Well, I try not to, because it then begins to affect your behavior.

39:18.680 --> 39:25.680
 You begin to alter your behavior to match your expectation of when you're going to die.

39:25.680 --> 39:29.680
 So let's talk about youth and then let's talk about death.

39:29.680 --> 39:37.680
 Okay. When I interview scientists on radio, I often ask them, what made the difference?

39:37.680 --> 39:41.680
 How old were you? What changed your life?

39:41.680 --> 39:43.680
 And they always say more or less the same thing.

39:43.680 --> 39:48.680
 No, these are Nobel Prize winners, directors of major laboratories, very distinguished scientists.

39:48.680 --> 39:54.680
 They always say, when I was 10, when I was 10, something happened.

39:54.680 --> 40:01.680
 It was a visit to the planetarium. It was a telescope for Stephen Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize.

40:01.680 --> 40:04.680
 It was the chemistry kit for Heinz Pegels.

40:04.680 --> 40:07.680
 It was a visit to the planetarium for Isidore Robbie.

40:07.680 --> 40:11.680
 It was a book. What the planets for Albert Einstein?

40:11.680 --> 40:13.680
 It was a compass.

40:13.680 --> 40:17.680
 Something happened, which gives them this existential shock.

40:17.680 --> 40:21.680
 Because you see, before the age of 10, everything is mommy and daddy, mommy and dad.

40:21.680 --> 40:24.680
 That's your universe, mommy and daddy.

40:24.680 --> 40:29.680
 Around the age of 10, you begin to wonder what's beyond mommy and daddy.

40:29.680 --> 40:32.680
 And that's when you have this epiphany.

40:32.680 --> 40:39.680
 When you realize, oh my God, there's a universe out there, a universe of discovery.

40:39.680 --> 40:44.680
 And that sensation stays with you for the rest of your life.

40:44.680 --> 40:50.680
 You still remember that shock that you felt gazing at the universe.

40:50.680 --> 40:56.680
 And then you hit the greatest destroyer of scientists known to science.

40:56.680 --> 41:03.680
 The greatest destroyer of scientists known to science is junior high school.

41:03.680 --> 41:08.680
 When you hit junior high school, folks, it's all over.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.680
 It's all over.

41:10.680 --> 41:14.680
 Because in junior high school, people say, hey, stupid.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.680
 I mean, you like that nerdy stuff.

41:17.680 --> 41:22.680
 And your friends shun you. All of a sudden, people think you're a weirdo.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.680
 And science is made boring.

41:24.680 --> 41:31.680
 You know, Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize winner, when he was a child, his father would take him into the forest.

41:31.680 --> 41:34.680
 And the father would teach him everything about birds.

41:34.680 --> 41:36.680
 Why do they shape the way they are?

41:36.680 --> 41:42.680
 Their wings, the coloration, the shape of their beak, everything about birds.

41:42.680 --> 41:50.680
 So one day, a bully comes up to the future Nobel Prize winner and says, hey, Dick, what's the name of that bird over there?

41:50.680 --> 41:52.680
 Well, he didn't know.

41:52.680 --> 41:58.680
 He knew everything about that bird, except its name.

41:58.680 --> 42:00.680
 So he said, I don't know.

42:00.680 --> 42:04.680
 And then the bully said, what's the matter, Dick, you stupid or something?

42:04.680 --> 42:08.680
 And then in that instant, he got it.

42:08.680 --> 42:09.680
 He got it.

42:09.680 --> 42:15.680
 He realized that for most people, science is giving names to birds.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.680
 That's what science is.

42:17.680 --> 42:19.680
 You know, lots of names of obscure things.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.680
 Hey, people say, you're smart.

42:21.680 --> 42:22.680
 You're smart.

42:22.680 --> 42:24.680
 You know all the names of the dinosaurs.

42:24.680 --> 42:26.680
 You know all the names of the plants.

42:26.680 --> 42:29.680
 No, that's not science at all.

42:29.680 --> 42:36.680
 Science is about principles, concepts, physical pictures.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.680
 That's what science is all about.

42:38.680 --> 42:47.680
 My favorite quote from Einstein is that unless you can explain the theory to a child, the theory is probably worthless.

42:47.680 --> 42:52.680
 Meaning that all great theories are not big words.

42:52.680 --> 42:59.680
 All great theories are simple concepts, principles, basic physical pictures.

42:59.680 --> 43:06.680
 Relativity is all about clocks, meter sticks, rocket ships and locomotives.

43:06.680 --> 43:12.680
 Newton's laws of gravity are all about balls and spinning wheels and things like that.

43:12.680 --> 43:17.680
 That's what physics and science is all about, not memorizing things.

43:17.680 --> 43:20.680
 And that stays with you for the rest of your life.

43:20.680 --> 43:27.680
 So even in old age, I've noticed that these scientists, when they sit back, they still remember.

43:27.680 --> 43:34.680
 They still remember that flush, that flush of excitement they felt with that first telescope.

43:34.680 --> 43:38.680
 That first moment when they encountered the universe.

43:38.680 --> 43:42.680
 That keeps them going. That keeps them going.

43:42.680 --> 43:48.680
 By the way, I should point out that when I was eight, something happened to me as well.

43:48.680 --> 43:56.680
 When I was eight years old, it was in all the papers that a great scientist had just died.

43:56.680 --> 44:00.680
 And they put a picture of his desk on the front page.

44:00.680 --> 44:05.680
 That's it. Just a simple picture of the front page of the newspapers of his desk.

44:05.680 --> 44:08.680
 That desk had a book on it, which was opened.

44:08.680 --> 44:16.680
 And the caption said, more or less, this is the unfinished manuscript from the greatest scientists of our time.

44:16.680 --> 44:21.680
 So I said to myself, well, why couldn't you finish it?

44:21.680 --> 44:26.680
 What's so hard that you can't finish it if you're a great scientist?

44:26.680 --> 44:33.680
 It's a homework problem, right? You go home, you solve it, or you ask your mom, why couldn't you solve it?

44:33.680 --> 44:37.680
 So to me, this was a murder mystery. This was greater than any adventure story.

44:37.680 --> 44:42.680
 I had to know why the greatest scientists of our time couldn't finish something.

44:42.680 --> 44:47.680
 And then over the years, I found out the guy had a name, Albert Einstein,

44:47.680 --> 44:51.680
 and that book was the theory of everything.

44:51.680 --> 44:55.680
 It was unfinished. Well, today I can read that book.

44:55.680 --> 44:59.680
 I can see all the dead ends and false starts that he made.

44:59.680 --> 45:09.680
 And it began to realize that he lost his way because he didn't have a physical picture to guide him on the third try.

45:09.680 --> 45:15.680
 On the first try, he talked about clocks and lightning bolts and meter sticks,

45:15.680 --> 45:19.680
 and that gave us special relativity, which gave us the atomic bomb.

45:19.680 --> 45:26.680
 The second great picture was gravity with balls rolling on curved surfaces,

45:26.680 --> 45:30.680
 and that gave us the Big Bang, creation of the universe, black holes.

45:30.680 --> 45:37.680
 On the third try, he missed it. He had no picture at all to guide him.

45:37.680 --> 45:41.680
 In fact, there's a quote I have where he said, I'm still looking.

45:41.680 --> 45:45.680
 I'm still looking for that picture. He never found it.

45:45.680 --> 45:49.680
 Well, today we think that picture is string theory.

45:49.680 --> 45:54.680
 The string theory can unify gravity and this mysterious thing that Einstein didn't like,

45:54.680 --> 45:58.680
 which is quantum mechanics, or couldn't quite pin down and make sense of.

45:58.680 --> 46:02.680
 That's right. Mother Nature has two hands, a left hand and a right hand.

46:02.680 --> 46:07.680
 The left hand is a theory of the small. The right hand is a theory of the big.

46:07.680 --> 46:11.680
 The theory of the small is the quantum theory, the theory of atoms and quarks.

46:11.680 --> 46:15.680
 The theory of the big is relativity, the theory of black holes, big bangs.

46:15.680 --> 46:21.680
 The problem is the left hand does not talk to the right hand.

46:21.680 --> 46:26.680
 They hate each other. The left hand is based on discrete particles.

46:26.680 --> 46:30.680
 The right hand is based on smooth surfaces.

46:30.680 --> 46:35.680
 How do you put these two things together into a single theory? They hate each other.

46:35.680 --> 46:39.680
 The greatest minds of our time, the greatest minds of our time,

46:39.680 --> 46:42.680
 worked on this problem and failed.

46:42.680 --> 46:48.680
 Today, the only theory that has survived every challenge so far is string theory.

46:48.680 --> 46:52.680
 That doesn't mean string theory is correct. It could very well be wrong.

46:52.680 --> 46:55.680
 But right now, it's the only game in town.

46:55.680 --> 46:59.680
 Some people come up to me and say, professor, I don't believe in string theory.

46:59.680 --> 47:06.680
 Give me an alternative. And I tell them, there is none. Get used to it.

47:06.680 --> 47:10.680
 It's the best theory we got. It's the only theory we have.

47:10.680 --> 47:19.680
 It's the only theory you have. Do you see the strings kind of inspire a view

47:19.680 --> 47:25.680
 as did atoms and particles and quarks, but especially strings inspire a view of the universe

47:25.680 --> 47:30.680
 as a kind of information processing system, as a computer of sorts.

47:30.680 --> 47:33.680
 Do you see the universe in this way?

47:33.680 --> 47:39.680
 No. Some people think, in fact, the whole universe is a computer of some sort.

47:39.680 --> 47:44.680
 And they believe that perhaps everything, therefore, is a simulation.

47:44.680 --> 47:52.680
 I don't think so. I don't think that there is a super video game where we are nothing but puppets dancing on the screen

47:52.680 --> 47:57.680
 and somebody hit the play button and here we are talking about simulations.

47:57.680 --> 48:04.680
 Now, even Newtonian mechanics says that the weather, the simple weather is so complicated

48:04.680 --> 48:10.680
 with trillions upon trillions of atoms that it cannot be simulated in a finite amount of time.

48:10.680 --> 48:20.680
 In other words, the smallest object which can describe the weather and simulate the weather is the weather itself.

48:20.680 --> 48:26.680
 The smallest object that can simulate a human is the human itself.

48:26.680 --> 48:34.680
 And if you add quantum mechanics, it becomes almost impossible to simulate it with a conventional computer.

48:34.680 --> 48:41.680
 Because quantum mechanics deals with all possible universes, parallel universes, a multiverse of universes.

48:41.680 --> 48:45.680
 And so the calculation just spirals out of control.

48:45.680 --> 48:53.680
 Now, at so far, there's only one way where you might be able to argue that the universe is a simulation

48:53.680 --> 48:57.680
 and this is still being debated by quantum physicists.

48:57.680 --> 49:03.680
 It turns out that if you throw the encyclopedia into a black hole, the information is not lost.

49:03.680 --> 49:06.680
 Eventually, it winds up on the surface of the black hole.

49:06.680 --> 49:09.680
 Now, the surface of the black hole is finite.

49:09.680 --> 49:14.680
 In fact, you can calculate the maximum amount of information you can store in a black hole.

49:14.680 --> 49:18.680
 It's a finite number. It's a calculable number, believe it or not.

49:18.680 --> 49:23.680
 Now, if the universe were made out of black holes, which is the maximum universe you can conceive of,

49:23.680 --> 49:28.680
 each universe, each black hole has a finite amount of information.

49:28.680 --> 49:37.680
 Therefore, ergo, the total amount of information in a universe is finite.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.680
 This is mind boggling.

49:39.680 --> 49:45.680
 This, I consider mind boggling, that all possible universes are countable

49:45.680 --> 49:49.680
 and all possible universes can be summarized in a number.

49:49.680 --> 49:54.680
 A number you can write on a sheet of paper, all possible universes, and it's a finite number.

49:54.680 --> 49:58.680
 Now, it's huge. It's a number beyond human imagination.

49:58.680 --> 50:02.680
 It's a number based on what is called a Planck length, but it's a number.

50:02.680 --> 50:09.680
 If a computer could ever simulate that number, then the universe would be a simulation.

50:09.680 --> 50:19.680
 Theoretically, because the amount of information is finite, well, there necessarily must be able to exist a computer.

50:19.680 --> 50:23.680
 From an engineering perspective, it may be impossible to build.

50:23.680 --> 50:30.680
 Yes, no computer can build a universe capable of simulating the entire universe except the universe itself.

50:30.680 --> 50:37.680
 That's your intuition, that our universe is very efficient, and so there's no shortcuts.

50:37.680 --> 50:40.680
 Two reasons why I believe the universe is not a simulation.

50:40.680 --> 50:43.680
 First, the calculational numbers are just incredible.

50:43.680 --> 50:47.680
 No finite Turing machine can simulate the universe.

50:47.680 --> 50:53.680
 And second, why would any super intelligent being simulate humans?

50:53.680 --> 50:57.680
 If you think about it, most humans are kind of stupid.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.680
 I mean, we do all sorts of crazy, stupid things, right?

51:00.680 --> 51:05.680
 And we call it art. We call it humor. We call it human civilization.

51:05.680 --> 51:13.680
 So why should an advanced civilization go through all that effort just to simulate Saturday Night Live?

51:13.680 --> 51:21.680
 Well, that's a funny idea, but do you think it's possible that the act of creation cannot anticipate humans?

51:21.680 --> 51:27.680
 You simply set the initial conditions and set a bunch of physical laws, and just for the fun of it, see what happens.

51:27.680 --> 51:31.680
 You launch the thing, so you're not necessarily simulating everything.

51:31.680 --> 51:37.680
 You're not simulating every little bit in the sense that you could predict what's going to happen,

51:37.680 --> 51:42.680
 but you set the initial conditions, set the laws, and see what kind of fun stuff happens.

51:42.680 --> 51:46.680
 Well, in some sense, that's how life got started.

51:46.680 --> 51:51.680
 In the 1950s, Stanley did what is called the Miller experiment.

51:51.680 --> 51:59.680
 He put a bunch of hydrogen gas, methane, toxic gases with liquid and a spark

51:59.680 --> 52:04.680
 in a small glass beaker, and then he just walked away for a few weeks,

52:04.680 --> 52:12.680
 came back a few weeks later and bingo! Out of nothing and chaos came amino acids.

52:12.680 --> 52:18.680
 If he had lifted there for a few years, he might have gotten protein, protein molecules for free.

52:18.680 --> 52:23.680
 That's probably how life got started as an accident.

52:23.680 --> 52:30.680
 And if he had lifted there for perhaps a few million years, DNA might have formed in that beaker.

52:30.680 --> 52:38.680
 And so we think that, yeah, DNA, life, all that could have been an accident if you wait long enough.

52:38.680 --> 52:42.680
 And remember, our universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old.

52:42.680 --> 52:50.680
 That's plenty of time for lots of random things to happen, including life itself.

52:50.680 --> 52:56.680
 Yeah, we could be just a beautiful little random moment,

52:56.680 --> 53:04.680
 and there could be nearly an infinite number of those throughout the history of the universe, many creatures like us.

53:04.680 --> 53:07.680
 We perhaps are not the epitome of what the universe is created for.

53:07.680 --> 53:12.680
 Thank God. Let's hope not. Just look around.

53:12.680 --> 53:15.680
 Look to your left, look to your right.

53:15.680 --> 53:19.680
 When do you think the first human will step foot on Mars?

53:19.680 --> 53:24.680
 I think it's a good chance in the 2030s that we will be on Mars.

53:24.680 --> 53:28.680
 In fact, there's no physics reason why we can't do it.

53:28.680 --> 53:30.680
 It's an engineering problem.

53:30.680 --> 53:35.680
 It's a very difficult and dangerous engineering problem, but it is an engineering problem.

53:35.680 --> 53:42.680
 And in my book, Future of Humanity, I even speculate beyond that that by the end of the century,

53:42.680 --> 53:44.680
 we'll probably have the first starships.

53:44.680 --> 53:48.680
 The first starships will not look like the Enterprise at all.

53:48.680 --> 53:54.680
 There will probably be small computer ships that are fired by laser beams with parachutes.

53:54.680 --> 54:02.680
 And like what Stephen Hawking advocated, the Breakthrough Starshot program could send ships to the nearby stars

54:02.680 --> 54:08.680
 traveling at 20% the speed of light, reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years time.

54:08.680 --> 54:12.680
 Beyond that, we should have fusion power.

54:12.680 --> 54:19.680
 Fusion power is, in some sense, one of the ultimate sources of energy, but it's unstable.

54:19.680 --> 54:22.680
 And we don't have fusion power today.

54:22.680 --> 54:23.680
 Now, why is that?

54:23.680 --> 54:25.680
 First of all, stars form almost for free.

54:25.680 --> 54:29.680
 You get a bunch of gas large enough, it becomes a star.

54:29.680 --> 54:33.680
 I mean, you don't even have to do anything to it, and it becomes a star.

54:33.680 --> 54:37.680
 Why is fusion so difficult to put on the Earth?

54:37.680 --> 54:39.680
 Because in outer space, stars are monopoles.

54:39.680 --> 54:44.680
 They are single poles that are spherically symmetric,

54:44.680 --> 54:50.680
 and it's very easy to get spherically symmetric configurations of gas to compress into a star.

54:50.680 --> 54:53.680
 They just happen naturally all by itself.

54:53.680 --> 54:56.680
 The problem is magnetism is bipolar.

54:56.680 --> 54:58.680
 You have a North Pole and a South Pole.

54:58.680 --> 55:01.680
 And it's like trying to squeeze a long balloon.

55:01.680 --> 55:04.680
 Take a long balloon and try to squeeze it.

55:04.680 --> 55:07.680
 You squeeze one side, it bulges out the other side.

55:07.680 --> 55:10.680
 Well, that's the problem with fusion machines.

55:10.680 --> 55:14.680
 We use magnetism with a North Pole and a South Pole to squeeze gas,

55:14.680 --> 55:19.680
 and all sorts of anomalies and horrible configurations can take place,

55:19.680 --> 55:24.680
 because we're not squeezing something uniformly like in a star.

55:24.680 --> 55:26.680
 Stars, in some sense, are for free.

55:26.680 --> 55:30.680
 Fusion on the Earth is very difficult.

55:30.680 --> 55:36.680
 But I think it's inevitable, and it'll eventually give us unlimited power from seawater.

55:36.680 --> 55:40.680
 So seawater will be the ultimate source of energy for the planet Earth.

55:40.680 --> 55:42.680
 Why? What's the intuition there?

55:42.680 --> 55:47.680
 Because we'll extract hydrogen from seawater, burn hydrogen in the fusion reactor,

55:47.680 --> 55:53.680
 to give us unlimited energy without the meltdown, without the nuclear waste.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.680
 Why do we have meltdowns?

55:55.680 --> 56:00.680
 We have meltdowns because in the fusion reactors, every time you split the uranium atom, you get nuclear waste.

56:00.680 --> 56:06.680
 Tons of it, 30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year.

56:06.680 --> 56:10.680
 And it's hot. It's hot for thousands, millions of years.

56:10.680 --> 56:12.680
 That's why we have meltdowns.

56:12.680 --> 56:16.680
 But you see, the waste product of a fusion reactor is helium gas.

56:16.680 --> 56:19.680
 Helium gas is actually commercially valuable.

56:19.680 --> 56:21.680
 You can make money selling helium gas.

56:21.680 --> 56:25.680
 And so the waste product of a fusion reactor is helium,

56:25.680 --> 56:30.680
 not nuclear waste that we find in a commercial fusion plant.

56:30.680 --> 56:35.680
 And that controlling, mastering and controlling fusion allows us to

56:35.680 --> 56:39.680
 convert us into a type one, I guess, civilization, right?

56:39.680 --> 56:45.680
 Yeah, probably the backbone of a type one civilization will be fusion power.

56:45.680 --> 56:47.680
 We, by the way, are type zero.

56:47.680 --> 56:49.680
 We don't even rate on this scale.

56:49.680 --> 56:53.680
 We get energy from dead plants, for God's sake, oil and coal.

56:53.680 --> 56:57.680
 We are about 100 years from being type one, you know, get a calculator.

56:57.680 --> 57:05.680
 In fact, Carl Sagan calculated that we are about 0.7, fairly close to a 1.0.

57:05.680 --> 57:08.680
 For example, what is the internet?

57:08.680 --> 57:13.680
 The internet is the beginning of the first type one technology to enter into our century.

57:13.680 --> 57:16.680
 The first planetary technology is the internet.

57:16.680 --> 57:19.680
 What is the language of type one?

57:19.680 --> 57:26.680
 The internet already, English and Mandarin Chinese are the most dominant languages on the internet.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.680
 And what about the culture?

57:28.680 --> 57:38.680
 We're seeing a type one sports, soccer, the Olympics, a type one music, youth culture, rock and roll, rap music,

57:38.680 --> 57:45.680
 type one fashion, Gucci, Chanel, a type one economy, the European Union, NAFTA, what have you.

57:45.680 --> 57:51.680
 So we're beginning to see the beginnings of a type one culture and a type one civilization.

57:51.680 --> 57:55.680
 And inevitably, it will spread beyond this planet.

57:55.680 --> 58:04.680
 You talked about sending a 20% the speed of light on a chip into Alpha Centauri.

58:04.680 --> 58:12.680
 But in a slightly nearer term, what do you think about the idea when we still have to send biological or biological bodies,

58:12.680 --> 58:16.680
 the colonization of planets, colonization of Mars?

58:16.680 --> 58:22.680
 Do you see us becoming a two planet species ever or anytime soon?

58:22.680 --> 58:27.680
 Well, just remember the dinosaurs did not have a space program.

58:27.680 --> 58:30.680
 And that's why they're not here today.

58:30.680 --> 58:32.680
 How come there are no dinosaurs in this room today?

58:32.680 --> 58:35.680
 Because they didn't have a space program.

58:35.680 --> 58:40.680
 We do have a space program, which means that we have an insurance policy.

58:40.680 --> 58:44.680
 Now, I don't think we should bankrupt the earth or deplete the earth to go to Mars.

58:44.680 --> 58:46.680
 That's too expensive and not practical.

58:46.680 --> 58:53.680
 But we need a settlement, a settlement on Mars in case something bad happens to the planet Earth.

58:53.680 --> 58:55.680
 And that means we have to terraform Mars.

58:55.680 --> 59:02.680
 Now, to terraform Mars, if we could raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees, six degrees,

59:02.680 --> 59:08.680
 then the polar ice caps begin to melt, releasing water vapor.

59:08.680 --> 59:10.680
 Water vapor is the greenhouse gas.

59:10.680 --> 59:12.680
 It causes even more melting of the ice caps.

59:12.680 --> 59:16.680
 So it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

59:16.680 --> 59:18.680
 It feeds on itself.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.680
 It becomes autocatalytic.

59:20.680 --> 59:26.680
 And so once you hit six degrees, rising of the temperature on Mars by six degrees, it takes off.

59:26.680 --> 59:37.680
 And we melt the polar ice caps and liquid water once again flows in the rivers, the canals, the channels, and the oceans of Mars.

59:37.680 --> 59:41.680
 Mars once had an ocean, we think, about the size of the United States.

59:41.680 --> 59:43.680
 And so that is a possibility.

59:43.680 --> 59:45.680
 Now, how do we get there?

59:45.680 --> 59:48.680
 How do we raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees?

59:48.680 --> 59:52.680
 Elon Musk would like to detonate hydrogen warheads on the polar ice caps.

59:52.680 --> 1:00:02.680
 Well, I'm not sure about that because we don't know that much about the effects of detonating hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps.

1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:06.680
 And who wants to glow in the dark at night reading the newspaper?

1:00:06.680 --> 1:00:11.680
 So I think there are other ways to do it with solar satellites.

1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:18.680
 You can have satellites orbiting Mars that beam sunlight onto the polar ice caps, melting the polar ice caps.

1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:20.680
 Mars has plenty of water.

1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:23.680
 It's just frozen.

1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:28.680
 I think you paint an inspiring and a wonderful picture of the future.

1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:36.680
 I think you've inspired and educated thousands, if not millions.

1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:38.680
 Michio, it's been an honor. Thank you so much for talking today.

1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:59.680
 My pleasure.
