00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
 The following is a conversation with Donald Knuth, one of the greatest and most impactful

00:05.680 --> 00:09.560
 computer scientists and mathematicians ever.

00:09.560 --> 00:16.160
 He's the recipient of the 1974 Turing Award, considered the Nobel Prize of Computing.

00:16.160 --> 00:23.400
 He's the author of the multivalium work, the Magnum Opus, the Art of Computer Programming.

00:23.400 --> 00:29.720
 He made several key contributions to the rigorous analysis of computational complexity of algorithms,

00:29.720 --> 00:37.640
 including the popularization of asymptotic notation that we all affectionately know as the big O notation.

00:37.640 --> 00:43.160
 He also created the tech typesetting system, which most computer scientists, physicists,

00:43.160 --> 00:49.360
 mathematicians, and scientists and engineers in general use to write technical papers and

00:49.360 --> 00:51.760
 make them look beautiful.

00:51.760 --> 00:58.640
 I can imagine no better guest to end 2019 with than Don, one of the kindest, most brilliant

00:58.640 --> 01:00.720
 people in our field.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.320
 This podcast was recorded many months ago.

01:03.320 --> 01:09.120
 It's one I avoided because, perhaps counterintuitively, the conversation meant so much to me.

01:09.120 --> 01:13.480
 If you can believe it, I knew even less about recording back then, so the camera angle is

01:13.480 --> 01:14.480
 a bit off.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.360
 I hope that's okay with you.

01:16.360 --> 01:22.480
 The office space was a bit cramped for filming, but it was a magical space, where Don does

01:22.480 --> 01:23.680
 most of his work.

01:23.680 --> 01:27.040
 It meant a lot to me that he would welcome me into his home.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.360
 It was quite a journey to get there, as many people know.

01:30.360 --> 01:33.600
 He doesn't check email, so I had to get creative.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.760
 The effort was worth it.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.280
 I've been doing this podcast on the side for just over a year.

01:39.280 --> 01:43.400
 Sometimes I had to sacrifice a bit of sleep, but always happy to do it, and to be part

01:43.400 --> 01:46.840
 of an amazing community of curious minds.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.960
 Thank you for your kind words of support and for the interesting discussions, and I look

01:50.960 --> 01:54.560
 forward to many more of those in 2020.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.560

 Alex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.560
 I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.

02:13.560 --> 02:17.880
 I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode and never any ads in the middle

02:17.880 --> 02:19.920
 that break the flow of the conversation.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.680
 I hope that works for you, and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

02:23.680 --> 02:27.320
 I provide timestamps for the start of the conversation that you can skip to, but it

02:27.320 --> 02:32.200
 helps if you listen to the ad and support this podcast by trying out the product or

02:32.200 --> 02:34.400
 service being advertised.

02:34.400 --> 02:39.120
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:39.120 --> 02:44.320
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends, but you can also use it to buy, sell,

02:44.320 --> 02:46.680
 and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.880
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

02:49.880 --> 02:55.080
 You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.

02:55.080 --> 02:59.880
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square and a member

02:59.880 --> 03:00.880
 of SIPC.

03:00.880 --> 03:05.480
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App to support one of my favorite organizations

03:05.480 --> 03:10.560
 called FIRST, best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.

03:10.560 --> 03:16.200
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students in over 110 countries and have

03:16.200 --> 03:21.240
 a perfect rating on Charity Navigator, which means that donated money is used to maximum

03:21.240 --> 03:23.360
 effectiveness.

03:23.360 --> 03:29.040
 When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use code LEX Podcast, you'll

03:29.040 --> 03:34.880
 get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, which again is an organization that

03:34.880 --> 03:40.680
 I've personally seen inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world.

03:40.680 --> 03:45.600
 And now, here's my conversation with Donald Knuth.

03:45.600 --> 03:55.040
 In 1957, at Case Tech, you were once allowed to spend several evenings with an IBM 650

03:55.040 --> 03:59.440
 computer, as you've talked about in the past, and you fell in love with computing then.

03:59.440 --> 04:06.520
 Can you take me back to that moment with the IBM 650?

04:06.520 --> 04:09.240
 What was it that grabbed you about that computer?

04:09.240 --> 04:19.480
 So the IBM 650 was this machine that, well, it didn't fill a room, but it was big and

04:19.480 --> 04:20.480
 noisy.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.200
 But when I first saw it, it was through a window, and there were just a lot of lights

04:24.200 --> 04:26.520
 flashing on it.

04:26.520 --> 04:36.080
 And I was a freshman, I had a job with the statistics group, and I was supposed to punch

04:36.080 --> 04:40.440
 cards for data and then sort them on another machine.

04:40.440 --> 04:48.440
 But then they got this new computer, came in, and it had interesting lights, okay.

04:48.440 --> 04:54.120
 So, well, but I had a key to the building, so I could get in and look at it and got a

04:54.120 --> 04:56.200
 manual for it.

04:56.200 --> 05:00.480
 And my first experience was based on the fact that I could punch cards, basically, which

05:00.480 --> 05:02.520
 was a big thing for the IBM 650.

05:02.520 --> 05:13.600
 But the IBM 650 was big in size, but incredibly small in power in memory.

05:13.600 --> 05:20.440
 It had 2,000 words of memory, and a word of memory was 10 decimal digits plus a sign.

05:20.440 --> 05:26.880
 And it would do, add two numbers together, you could probably expect that would take,

05:26.880 --> 05:30.280
 I'll say, three milliseconds.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.280
 So...

05:31.280 --> 05:34.720
 Yes, the memory is the constraint, the memory is the problem.

05:34.720 --> 05:39.080
 That was why it took three milliseconds, because it took five milliseconds for the drum to

05:39.080 --> 05:45.480
 go around, and you had to wait, I don't know, five cycle times.

05:45.480 --> 05:50.120
 If you have an instruction in one position on the drum, then it would be ready to read

05:50.120 --> 05:55.720
 the data for the instruction, and you know, go three notches.

05:55.720 --> 06:00.760
 The drum is 50 cycles around, and you go three cycles, and you can get the data, and then

06:00.760 --> 06:04.600
 you can go another three cycles and get to your next instruction.

06:04.600 --> 06:10.000
 If the instruction is there, otherwise you spin until you get to the right place.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.160
 And we had no random access memory whatsoever until my senior year.

06:14.160 --> 06:19.840
 In senior year, we got 50 words of random access memory, which were priceless, and we

06:19.840 --> 06:27.640
 would move stuff up to the random access memory in 60 word chunks, and then we would start

06:27.640 --> 06:28.640
 again.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.200
 So, subroutine went to go up there and...

06:31.200 --> 06:37.760
 Could you have predicted the future 60 years later of computing from then?

06:37.760 --> 06:44.360
 You know, in fact, the hardest question I was ever asked was, what could I have predicted?

06:44.360 --> 06:50.400
 In other words, the interviewer asked me, she said, you know, what about computing has

06:50.400 --> 06:54.680
 surprised you, you know, and immediately I ran, I rattled off a couple dozen things,

06:54.680 --> 06:57.600
 and then she said, okay, so what didn't surprise?

06:57.600 --> 07:05.600
 And I tried for five minutes to think of something that I would have predicted, and I couldn't.

07:05.600 --> 07:12.240
 But let me say that this machine, I didn't know, well, there wasn't much else in the

07:12.240 --> 07:13.520
 world at that time.

07:13.520 --> 07:19.640
 The 650 was the first machine that was, that there were more than a thousand of ever.

07:19.640 --> 07:25.200
 Before that, there were, you know, each machine there might be a half a dozen examples, maybe

07:25.200 --> 07:26.200
 a couple dozen.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.160
 Maybe a couple dozen mass produced.

07:28.160 --> 07:37.920
 The first one, yeah, done in quantity, and IBM didn't sell them, they rented them, but

07:37.920 --> 07:44.760
 they rented them to universities at great, you know, had a great deal.

07:44.760 --> 07:51.680
 And so that's why a lot of students learned about computers at that time.

07:51.680 --> 07:58.520
 So you refer to people, including yourself, who gravitate toward a kind of computational

07:58.520 --> 08:00.920
 thinking as geeks.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.920
 At least I've heard you use that terminology.

08:02.920 --> 08:08.240
 It's true that I think there's something that happened to me as I was growing up that

08:08.240 --> 08:14.160
 made my brain structure in a certain way that resonates with computers.

08:14.160 --> 08:20.040
 So there's this space of people, two percent of the population you empirically estimate.

08:20.040 --> 08:27.960
 That's been fairly constant over most of my career, however, it might be different now

08:27.960 --> 08:30.880
 because kids have different experiences when they're young.

08:30.880 --> 08:35.560
 So what does the world look like to a geek?

08:35.560 --> 08:45.440
 What is, what is this aspect of thinking that is unique to, yeah, that makes a geek?

08:45.440 --> 08:49.400
 This is a hugely important question.

08:49.400 --> 08:59.600
 In the 50s, IBM noticed that there were geeks and nongeeks, and so they tried to hire geeks

08:59.600 --> 09:03.860
 and they put out ads with papers saying, you know, if you play chess, come to Madison

09:03.860 --> 09:08.100
 Avenue for an interview or something like this, they were trying for some things.

09:08.100 --> 09:15.000
 So what is it that I find easy and other people tend to find harder?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.760
 And I think there's two main things.

09:17.760 --> 09:26.960
 One is the ability to jump levels of abstraction.

09:26.960 --> 09:33.840
 So you see something in the large and you see something in the small and you pass between

09:33.840 --> 09:35.880
 those unconsciously.

09:35.880 --> 09:43.720
 So you know that in order to solve some big problem, what you need to do is add one to

09:43.720 --> 09:50.240
 a certain register and it gets to another step and below the, I mean, I don't go down

09:50.240 --> 09:55.240
 to the electron level, but I knew what those milliseconds were, what the drum was like.

09:55.240 --> 10:01.880
 On the 650, I knew how I was going to factor a number or find a root of an equation or

10:01.880 --> 10:05.080
 something because of what was doing.

10:05.080 --> 10:11.120
 And as I'm debugging, I'm going through, you know, did I make a key punch error?

10:11.120 --> 10:13.080
 Did I write the wrong instruction?

10:13.080 --> 10:16.040
 Do I have the wrong thing in a register?

10:16.040 --> 10:26.920
 And each level is different and this idea of being able to see something at lots of

10:26.920 --> 10:32.800
 levels and fluently go between them seems to me to be more pronounced, much more pronounced

10:32.800 --> 10:37.480
 in the people that resonate with computers.

10:37.480 --> 10:47.520
 So in my books, I also don't stick just to the high level, but I mix low level stuff

10:47.520 --> 10:55.720
 with high level and this means that some people think, you know, that I should write better

10:55.720 --> 11:04.120
 books and it's probably true, but other people say, well, if you think like that, then that's

11:04.120 --> 11:10.040
 the way to train yourself, keep mixing the levels and learn more and more how to jump

11:10.040 --> 11:11.040
 between.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.040
 So that's the one thing.

11:12.040 --> 11:21.880
 The other thing is that it's more of a talent to be able to deal with non uniformity where

11:21.880 --> 11:30.200
 there's case one, case two, case three, instead of having one or two rules that govern everything.

11:30.200 --> 11:38.600
 So it doesn't bother me if I need, like an algorithm has 10 steps to it, you know, each

11:38.600 --> 11:44.360
 step does something else that doesn't bother me, but a lot of pure mathematics is based

11:44.360 --> 11:48.800
 on one or two rules, which are universal.

11:48.800 --> 11:54.080
 And so this means that people like me sometimes work with systems that are more complicated

11:54.080 --> 12:01.400
 than necessary because it doesn't bother us that we don't, that we didn't figure out the

12:01.400 --> 12:02.400
 simple rule.

12:02.400 --> 12:07.520
 And you mentioned that while Jacobi Bool, Abel, all the mathematicians in the 19th century

12:07.520 --> 12:15.960
 may have had symptoms of geek, the first 100% legit geek was touring Alan Turing.

12:15.960 --> 12:25.800
 I think he had a lot more of this quality than any, just from reading the kind of stuff

12:25.800 --> 12:26.800
 he did.

12:26.800 --> 12:34.480
 So how does touring, what influence has touring had on you in your way of thinking?

12:34.480 --> 12:35.480
 Well, okay.

12:35.480 --> 12:40.520
 So I didn't know that aspect of him until after I graduated somewhere.

12:40.520 --> 12:47.880
 As an undergraduate, we had a class that talked about computability theory and touring machines.

12:47.880 --> 12:56.520
 And it was all, it sounded like a very specific kind of purely theoretical approach to stuff.

12:56.520 --> 13:08.560
 So how old was he when I learned that he had a design machine and that he wrote a wonderful

13:08.560 --> 13:13.800
 manual for Manchester machines.

13:13.800 --> 13:23.960
 And he invented subroutines and he was a real hacker that he had his hands dirty.

13:23.960 --> 13:30.840
 I thought for many years that he had only done purely formal work.

13:30.840 --> 13:38.400
 As they started reading his own publications, I could feel this kinship.

13:38.400 --> 13:46.160
 And of course, he had a lot of peculiarities, like he wrote numbers backwards because left

13:46.160 --> 13:51.160
 to right instead of right to left, because that was easier for computers to process them

13:51.160 --> 13:52.160
 that way.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.360
 What do you mean left to right?

13:54.360 --> 14:03.680
 He would write Pi as 9514.3, I mean, okay.

14:03.680 --> 14:07.120
 Right, got it.

14:07.120 --> 14:17.960
 On the blackboard, I mean, he had trained himself to do that because the computers he

14:17.960 --> 14:21.160
 was working with worked that way inside.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.560
 Trained himself to think like a computer.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.560
 Well, there you go.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.720
 That's geek thinking.

14:26.720 --> 14:32.280
 You've practiced some of the most elegant formalism in computer science.

14:32.280 --> 14:38.200
 And yet you're the creator of a concept like literate programming, which seems to move

14:38.200 --> 14:42.920
 closer to natural language type of description of programming.

14:42.920 --> 14:43.920
 Yeah, absolutely.

14:43.920 --> 14:50.920
 Do you see those two as conflicting as the formalism of theory and the idea of literate

14:50.920 --> 14:51.920
 programming?

14:51.920 --> 14:59.080
 So there we are in a nonuniform system where I don't think one size fits all and I don't

14:59.080 --> 15:03.360
 think all truth lies in one kind of expertise.

15:03.360 --> 15:13.640
 And so somehow, in a way, you'd say my life is a convex combination of English and mathematics.

15:13.640 --> 15:14.800
 And you're okay with that?

15:14.800 --> 15:16.240
 And not only that, I think...

15:16.240 --> 15:17.240
 Thrive in it.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.240
 I wish...

15:18.240 --> 15:19.240
 I want my kids to be that way.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.240
 I want...

15:20.240 --> 15:21.240
 Et cetera.

15:21.240 --> 15:25.480
 Use left brain, right brain at the same time, you got a lot more done.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.960
 That was part of the bargain.

15:28.960 --> 15:36.680
 And I've heard that you didn't really read for pleasure until into your 30s in literature.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.920
 Yeah, that's true.

15:37.920 --> 15:41.680
 You know more about me than I do, but I'll try to be consistent with what you read.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.080
 Yeah, no, just believe me.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.680
 I just go with whatever story I tell you.

15:45.680 --> 15:46.840
 It would be easier that way.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.840
 The conversation...

15:47.840 --> 15:49.320
 Right, yeah, no, that's true.

15:49.320 --> 15:56.400
 So I've heard mention of Philip Roth's American Pastoral, which I love as a book.

15:56.400 --> 16:03.520
 I don't know if it was mentioned as something, I think, that was meaningful to you as well.

16:03.520 --> 16:07.440
 In either case, what literary books had a lasting impact on you?

16:07.440 --> 16:08.440
 What literature?

16:08.440 --> 16:09.800
 Yeah, okay, good question.

16:09.800 --> 16:17.800
 So I met Roth when we both got doctors from Harvard on the same day.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.800
 So we were...

16:18.800 --> 16:24.400
 Yeah, we had lunch together and stuff like that, but he knew that computer books would

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
 never sell.

16:25.400 --> 16:36.160
 Well, all right, so you say you were a teenager when you left Russia, so I have to say that

16:36.160 --> 16:42.880
 Tolstoy was one of the big influences on me, especially like Anna Karnina.

16:42.880 --> 16:54.840
 Not because of the plot of the story, but because there's this character who...

16:54.840 --> 17:04.360
 The philosophical discussions, the whole way of life is worked out there among the characters,

17:04.360 --> 17:08.800
 and so that I thought was especially beautiful.

17:08.800 --> 17:15.720
 On the other hand, Dostoevsky, I didn't like it all because I felt that his genius was

17:15.720 --> 17:21.200
 mostly because he kept forgetting what he had started out to do and he was just sloppy.

17:21.200 --> 17:30.040
 I didn't think that he polished his stuff at all, and I tend to admire somebody who

17:30.040 --> 17:32.720
 dodged the eyes and crosses the T's.

17:32.720 --> 17:36.760
 So the music of the prose is what you admire more than...?

17:36.760 --> 17:41.680
 I certainly do admire the music of the language, which I couldn't appreciate in the Russian

17:41.680 --> 17:48.120
 original, but I can in Victor Hugo because French is closer.

17:48.120 --> 17:58.600
 But Tolstoy, the same reason I like Herman Wook as a novelist, I think his book Marjorie

17:58.600 --> 18:04.080
 Morningstar has a similar character in Hugo who developed his own personal philosophy

18:04.080 --> 18:08.760
 and it goes in the...

18:08.760 --> 18:09.760
 Was consistent?

18:09.760 --> 18:14.160
 Yeah, right, and it's worth pondering.

18:14.160 --> 18:18.200
 So you don't like Nietzsche and...

18:18.200 --> 18:19.200
 Like what?

18:19.200 --> 18:20.600
 You don't like Friedrich Nietzsche or...?

18:20.600 --> 18:28.080
 Nietzsche, yeah, no, no, yeah, I keep seeing quotations from Nietzsche and he never tempt

18:28.080 --> 18:29.800
 me to read any further.

18:29.800 --> 18:34.520
 Well, he's full of contradictions, so you will certainly not appreciate him.

18:34.520 --> 18:41.160
 But Schiller, I'm trying to get across what I appreciate in literature and part of it

18:41.160 --> 18:51.240
 is, as you say, the music of the language, the way it flows and take Raymond Chandler

18:51.240 --> 18:52.520
 versus Dashel Hammett.

18:52.520 --> 18:59.600
 Dashel Hammett's sentences are awful and Raymond Chandler's are beautiful, they just

18:59.600 --> 19:00.600
 flow.

19:00.600 --> 19:08.800
 So I don't read literature because it's supposed to be good for me or because somebody said

19:08.800 --> 19:17.440
 it's great, but I find things that I like, I mean, you mentioned you were dressed like

19:17.440 --> 19:24.040
 James Bond, so I love Ian Fleming, I think he's got a really great gift for...

19:24.040 --> 19:29.720
 If he has a golf game or a game of bridge or something and this comes into his story,

19:29.720 --> 19:38.000
 it'll be the most exciting golf game or the absolute best possible hands of bridge that

19:38.000 --> 19:45.800
 exists and he exploits it and tells it beautifully.

19:45.800 --> 19:54.160
 So in connecting some things here, looking at literate programming and being able to

19:54.160 --> 20:06.360
 convey encode algorithms to a computer in a way that mimics how humans speak, what do

20:06.360 --> 20:11.760
 you think about natural language in general and the messiness of our human world, about

20:11.760 --> 20:15.680
 trying to express difficult things?

20:15.680 --> 20:25.600
 So the idea of literate programming is really to try to understand something better by seeing

20:25.600 --> 20:30.920
 it from at least two perspectives, the formal and the informal, if we're trying to understand

20:30.920 --> 20:36.560
 the complicated thing, if we can look at it in different ways, and so this is in fact

20:36.560 --> 20:42.360
 the key to technical writing, a good technical writer trying not to be obvious about it but

20:42.360 --> 20:48.560
 says everything twice, formally and informally, or maybe three times, but you try to give

20:48.560 --> 20:57.800
 the reader a way to put the concept into his own brain or her own brain.

20:57.800 --> 21:01.920
 Is that better for the writer or the reader or both?

21:01.920 --> 21:09.040
 Well the writer just tries to understand the reader, that's the goal of a writer is to have

21:09.040 --> 21:18.120
 a good mental image of the reader and to say what the reader expects next and to impress

21:18.120 --> 21:24.760
 the reader with what has impressed the writer, why something is interesting.

21:24.760 --> 21:30.080
 So when you have a computer program, instead of looking at it as something that we're just

21:30.080 --> 21:35.520
 trying to give instruction to the computer, what we really want to be is giving insight

21:35.520 --> 21:43.520
 to the person who's going to be maintaining this program or to the programmer himself

21:43.520 --> 21:47.320
 when he's debugging it as to why this stuff is being done.

21:47.320 --> 21:54.200
 And so all the techniques of exposition that a teacher uses or a book writer uses make

21:54.200 --> 22:01.040
 you a better programmer if your program is going to be not just a one shot deal.

22:01.040 --> 22:04.680
 So how difficult is that?

22:04.680 --> 22:12.080
 Do you see hope for the combination of informal and formal for the programming task?

22:12.080 --> 22:18.240
 Yeah, I'm the wrong person to ask I guess because I'm a geek but I think for a geek

22:18.240 --> 22:19.240
 it's easy.

22:19.240 --> 22:29.240
 Well, I don't know, some people have difficulty writing and it might be because there's something

22:29.240 --> 22:34.400
 in their brain structure that makes it hard for them to write or it might be something

22:34.400 --> 22:36.520
 just that they haven't had enough practice.

22:36.520 --> 22:42.880
 I'm not the right one to judge but I don't think you can teach any person any particular

22:42.880 --> 22:43.880
 skill.

22:43.880 --> 22:51.800
 So I do think that that writing is half of my life and so I put it together in a litter

22:51.800 --> 22:52.800
 program.

22:52.800 --> 23:01.560
 Even when I'm writing a one shot program, I write it in a litter way because I get it

23:01.560 --> 23:04.800
 right faster that way.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.360
 Now does it get compiled automatically?

23:07.360 --> 23:08.360
 Or?

23:08.360 --> 23:15.840
 So I guess on the technical side my question was how difficult is a design, a system where

23:15.840 --> 23:20.120
 much of the programming is done informally?

23:20.120 --> 23:21.120
 Informally.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.120
 Yeah, informally.

23:22.120 --> 23:32.800
 I think whatever works to make it understandable is good but then you have to also understand

23:32.800 --> 23:33.800
 how informal it is.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.320
 You have to know the limitations.

23:35.320 --> 23:46.760
 So by putting the formal and informal together, this is where it gets locked into your brain.

23:46.760 --> 23:53.040
 You can say informally, well I'm working on a problem right now.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.760
 Let's go there.

23:54.760 --> 24:00.240
 Can you give me an example of connecting the informal and the formal?

24:00.240 --> 24:03.560
 Well, it's a little too complicated an example.

24:03.560 --> 24:13.520
 There's a puzzle that's called a Japanese arrow puzzle and you're given a bunch of boxes

24:13.520 --> 24:19.160
 each one points northeast, south or west and at the end you're supposed to fill in each

24:19.160 --> 24:25.120
 box with the number of distinct numbers that it points to.

24:25.120 --> 24:30.680
 So if I put a three in a box and it's pointing to five other boxes, that means that there's

24:30.680 --> 24:35.360
 going to be three different numbers in those five boxes.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.800
 And those boxes are pointing, one of them might be pointing to me, one of them might

24:38.800 --> 24:40.720
 be pointing the other way.

24:40.720 --> 24:48.680
 But anyway, I'm supposed to find a set of numbers that obeys this complicated condition

24:48.680 --> 24:55.240
 that each number counts how many distinct numbers it points to.

24:55.240 --> 25:04.680
 And so a guy sent me his solution to this problem where he presents formal statements

25:04.680 --> 25:10.880
 that say either this is true or this is true or this is true and so I try to render that

25:10.880 --> 25:20.760
 formal statement informally and I try to say I contain a three and the guys I'm pointing

25:20.760 --> 25:25.400
 to contain the numbers one, two and six.

25:25.400 --> 25:32.680
 So by putting it informally and also I convert it into a dialogue statement that helps me

25:32.680 --> 25:37.920
 understand the logical statement that he's written down as a string of numbers in terms

25:37.920 --> 25:41.200
 of some abstract variables that he had.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.200
 That's really interesting.

25:42.200 --> 25:45.560
 So maybe an extension of that.

25:45.560 --> 25:52.660
 There has been a resurgence in computer science and machine learning and neural networks.

25:52.660 --> 25:56.640
 So using data to construct algorithms.

25:56.640 --> 26:04.000
 So it's another way to construct algorithms really, if you can think of it that way.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.280
 So as opposed to natural language to construct algorithms use data to construct algorithms.

26:08.280 --> 26:15.800
 So what's your view of this branch of computer science where data is almost more important

26:15.800 --> 26:18.800
 than the mechanism of the algorithm?

26:18.800 --> 26:28.840
 It seems to be suited to a certain kind of nongeek and which is probably why it's taken

26:28.840 --> 26:34.800
 off that it has its own community that really resonates with that.

26:34.800 --> 26:42.720
 But it's hard to trust something like that because nobody, even the people who work with

26:42.720 --> 26:47.640
 it, they have no idea what has been learned.

26:47.640 --> 26:55.760
 That's a really interesting thought that it makes algorithms more accessible to a different

26:55.760 --> 26:59.720
 community, a different type of brain.

26:59.720 --> 27:07.360
 And that's really interesting because just like literate programming perhaps could make

27:07.360 --> 27:10.760
 programming more accessible to a certain kind of brain.

27:10.760 --> 27:15.480
 There are people who think it's just a matter of education and anybody can learn to be a

27:15.480 --> 27:23.600
 great programmer, anybody can learn to be a great skier.

27:23.600 --> 27:29.240
 I wish that were true, but I know that there's a lot of things that I've tried to do.

27:29.240 --> 27:35.000
 And I was well motivated and I kept trying to build myself up and I never got past a

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
 certain level.

27:36.000 --> 27:44.120
 I can't view, for example, I can't view three dimensional objects in my head.

27:44.120 --> 27:48.560
 I have to make a model and look at it and study it from all points of view.

27:48.560 --> 27:55.000
 And then I start to get some idea of what other people are good at four dimensions.

27:55.000 --> 28:05.480
 Yeah, so let's go to the art of computer programming.

28:05.480 --> 28:13.920
 In 1962, you set the table of contents for this magnum opus, right?

28:13.920 --> 28:16.760
 It was supposed to be a single book with 12 chapters.

28:16.760 --> 28:26.840
 Now today, what is it, 57 years later, you're in the middle of volume 4 of 7.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.080
 In the middle of volume 4b is 4b.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.320
 More precisely.

28:30.320 --> 28:39.080
 Can ask you for an impossible task, which is try to summarize the book so far, maybe

28:39.080 --> 28:41.760
 by giving a little examples.

28:41.760 --> 28:47.000
 Also from the sorting and the search and the combinatorial algorithms, if you were to give

28:47.000 --> 28:56.240
 a summary, a quick elevator summary, depending how many floors there are in the building.

28:56.240 --> 29:05.480
 The first volume called fundamental algorithms talks about something that you can't do without.

29:05.480 --> 29:13.160
 You have to know the basic concepts of what is a program, what is an algorithm.

29:13.160 --> 29:18.200
 And it also talks about a low level machine so you can have some kind of an idea of what's

29:18.200 --> 29:20.560
 going on.

29:20.560 --> 29:27.080
 And it has basic concepts of input and output and subroutines.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.080
 Induction.

29:28.080 --> 29:37.080
 Mathematical preliminary, so the thing that makes my book different from a lot of others

29:37.080 --> 29:44.080
 is that I try to not only present the algorithm, but I try to analyze them, which means quantitatively

29:44.080 --> 29:48.280
 I say not only does it work, but it works this fast.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.800
 And so I need math for that.

29:49.800 --> 29:56.320
 And then the standard way to structure data inside and represent information in the computer.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.720
 So that's all volume one.

29:58.720 --> 30:04.320
 Volume two talks, it's called semi numerical algorithms, and here we're writing programs,

30:04.320 --> 30:07.760
 but we're also dealing with numbers.

30:07.760 --> 30:14.120
 Algorithms deal with any kinds of objects, but when there's objects or numbers, well,

30:14.120 --> 30:20.760
 then we have certain special paradigms that apply to things that have numbers.

30:20.760 --> 30:27.600
 And so there's arithmetic on numbers, and there's matrices full of numbers, there's

30:27.600 --> 30:33.760
 random numbers, and there's power series full of numbers, there's different algebraic

30:33.760 --> 30:37.360
 concepts that have numbers in structured ways.

30:37.360 --> 30:42.000
 And arithmetic in the way a computer would think about arithmetic, so floating point.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.560
 Floating point arithmetic, high precision arithmetic, not only addition, subtraction,

30:46.560 --> 30:51.040
 multiplication, but also comparison of numbers.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.640
 So then volume three talks about...

30:53.640 --> 30:54.640
 I like that one.

30:54.640 --> 30:55.640
 Sort and search.

30:55.640 --> 30:56.640
 Sorting and search.

30:56.640 --> 30:57.640
 I love sorting.

30:57.640 --> 30:58.640
 Right.

30:58.640 --> 31:03.000
 So here, we're not dealing necessarily with numbers because you sort letters and other

31:03.000 --> 31:07.520
 objects and searching we're doing all the time with Google nowadays, but I mean, we

31:07.520 --> 31:09.600
 have to find stuff.

31:09.600 --> 31:16.800
 So again, algorithms that underlie all kinds of applications.

31:16.800 --> 31:20.680
 None of these volumes is about a particular application, but the applications are examples

31:20.680 --> 31:26.720
 of why people want to know about sorting, why people want to know about random numbers.

31:26.720 --> 31:31.080
 So then volume four goes into combinatorial algorithm.

31:31.080 --> 31:40.520
 This is where we have billions of things to deal with, and here, we keep finding cases

31:40.520 --> 31:48.360
 where one good idea can make something go more than a million times faster, and we're

31:48.360 --> 31:54.840
 dealing with problems that are probably never going to be solved efficiently, but that doesn't

31:54.840 --> 32:01.880
 mean we give up on them and we have this chance to have good ideas and go much, much faster

32:01.880 --> 32:02.880
 on them.

32:02.880 --> 32:08.080
 So that's combinatorial algorithms, and those are the ones that are, I mean, you said sorting

32:08.080 --> 32:09.240
 is most fun for you.

32:09.240 --> 32:17.480
 Well, it's true it's fun, but combinatorial algorithms are the ones that I always enjoyed

32:17.480 --> 32:23.160
 the most because that's when my skillet programming had the most payoff.

32:23.160 --> 32:31.640
 The difference between an obvious algorithm that you think of first thing and an interesting

32:31.640 --> 32:40.040
 subtle algorithm that's not so obvious but circles around the other one, that's where

32:40.040 --> 32:43.680
 computer science really comes in.

32:43.680 --> 32:50.200
 And a lot of these combinatorial methods were found first in applications to artificial

32:50.200 --> 32:59.920
 intelligence or cryptography, and in my case, I just liked them, and it was associated more

32:59.920 --> 33:00.920
 with puzzles.

33:00.920 --> 33:05.280
 Now, do you like the most in the domain of graphs and graph theory?

33:05.280 --> 33:11.600
 Graphs are great because they're terrific models of so many things in the real world,

33:11.600 --> 33:17.960
 and if you throw in numbers on a graph, you've got a network, and so there you have many

33:17.960 --> 33:20.180
 more things.

33:20.180 --> 33:30.080
 But combinatorial, in general, is any arrangement of objects that has some kind of a higher

33:30.080 --> 33:38.280
 structure, nonrandom structure, and is it possible to put something together satisfying

33:38.280 --> 33:43.960
 all these conditions, like I mentioned, arrows a minute ago, is there a way to put these

33:43.960 --> 33:48.040
 numbers on a bunch of boxes that are pointing to each other, is that going to be possible

33:48.040 --> 33:49.040
 at all?

33:49.040 --> 33:50.120
 That's volume four.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.120
 That's volume four.

33:51.120 --> 33:53.240
 What is the future hold?

33:53.240 --> 34:01.280
 Volume four A was part one, and what happened was, in 1962, when I started writing down

34:01.280 --> 34:07.360
 a table of contents, it wasn't going to be a book about computer programming in general,

34:07.360 --> 34:14.640
 it was going to be a book about how to write compilers, and I was asked to write a book

34:14.640 --> 34:22.480
 about how to write a compiler, and at that time, there were only a few dozen people in

34:22.480 --> 34:29.720
 the world who had written compilers, and I happen to be one of them, and I also had some

34:29.720 --> 34:38.600
 experience writing for the campus newspaper and things like that, so I said, okay, great,

34:38.600 --> 34:43.840
 I'm the only person I know who's written a compiler but hasn't invented any new techniques

34:43.840 --> 34:50.520
 for writing compilers, and all the other people I knew had super ideas, but I couldn't see

34:50.520 --> 34:55.040
 that they would be able to write a book that would describe anybody else's ideas but their

34:55.040 --> 35:02.600
 own, so I could be the journalist and I could explain what all these cool ideas about compiler

35:02.600 --> 35:10.280
 writing were, and then I started putting down, well, yeah, you need to have a chapter about

35:10.280 --> 35:15.000
 data structures, you need to have some introductory material, you want to talk about searching

35:15.000 --> 35:27.520
 because a compiler writer has to look up the variables in a symbol table and find out when

35:27.520 --> 35:31.880
 you write the name of a variable in one place, it's supposed to be the same as the one you

35:31.880 --> 35:38.880
 put somewhere else, so you need all these basic techniques, and I kind of know some

35:38.880 --> 35:44.480
 arithmetic and stuff, so I threw in these chapters, and I threw in a chapter on combinatorics

35:44.480 --> 35:49.520
 because that was what I really enjoyed programming the most, but there weren't many algorithms

35:49.520 --> 35:55.640
 in known about combinatorial methods in 1962, so that was kind of a short chapter, but it

35:55.640 --> 36:02.320
 was sort of thrown in just for fun, and chapter 12 was going to be actual compilers, applying

36:02.320 --> 36:08.240
 all the stuff in chapters 1 to 11 to make compilers, well, okay, so that was my table

36:08.240 --> 36:16.000
 of contents from 1962, and during the 70s, the whole field of combinatorics went through

36:16.000 --> 36:18.080
 a huge explosion.

36:18.080 --> 36:23.000
 People talk about a combinatorial explosion, and they usually mean by that, that the number

36:23.000 --> 36:29.680
 of cases goes up, you know, N plus 1, and all of a sudden your problem has gotten more

36:29.680 --> 36:37.920
 than 10 times harder, but there was an explosion of ideas about combinatorics in the 70s,

36:37.920 --> 36:45.800
 to the point that it takes 1975, I bet you more than half of all the journals of computer

36:45.800 --> 36:48.760
 science were about combinatorial methods.

36:48.760 --> 36:52.520
 What kind of problems were occupying people's minds?

36:52.520 --> 36:54.800
 What kind of problems in combinatorics?

36:54.800 --> 36:57.720
 Was it satisfiability, graph theory?

36:57.720 --> 37:06.840
 Yeah, graph theory was quite dominant, I mean, but all of the NP hard problems that you have

37:06.840 --> 37:13.600
 like, you know, Hamiltonian path, going beyond, yeah, going beyond graphs, you had operation

37:13.600 --> 37:19.480
 research, whenever there was a small class of problems that had efficient solutions,

37:19.480 --> 37:24.760
 and they were usually associated with matroid theory, special mathematical construction,

37:24.760 --> 37:31.040
 but once we went to things that involved three things at a time instead of two, all of a

37:31.040 --> 37:38.160
 sudden, things got harder, so we had satisfiability problems where if you have clauses, every

37:38.160 --> 37:43.200
 clause has two logical elements in it, then we can satisfy it in linear time.

37:43.200 --> 37:48.000
 We can test for satisfiability in linear time, but if you allow yourself three variables

37:48.000 --> 37:52.640
 in the clause, then nobody knows how to do it.

37:52.640 --> 37:59.880
 So these articles were about trying to find better ways to solve cryptography problems

37:59.880 --> 38:05.720
 than graph theory problems, where we have lots of data, but we didn't know how to find

38:05.720 --> 38:13.000
 the best subsets of the data, like with sorting, we could get the answer, didn't take long.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.480
 So how did it continue to change from the 70s to today?

38:16.480 --> 38:25.040
 Yeah, so now there may be half a dozen conferences whose topic is combinatorics, different kind,

38:25.040 --> 38:31.240
 but fortunately, I don't have to rewrite my book every month like I had to in the 70s.

38:31.240 --> 38:37.080
 But still, there's a huge amount of work being done, and people getting better ideas on these

38:37.080 --> 38:44.440
 problems that don't seem to have really efficient solutions, but we can still do a lot more

38:44.440 --> 38:45.440
 with them.

38:45.440 --> 38:51.440
 And so this book that I'm finishing now, I've got a whole bunch of brand new methods that

38:51.440 --> 39:00.560
 as far as I know, there's no other book that covers this particular approach.

39:00.560 --> 39:09.560
 And so I'm trying to do my best of exploring the tip of the iceberg, and I try out lots

39:09.560 --> 39:16.600
 of things and keep rewriting as I find better method.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.840
 So what's your writing process like?

39:18.840 --> 39:23.120
 What's your thinking and writing process like every day?

39:23.120 --> 39:26.040
 So what's your routine even?

39:26.040 --> 39:34.320
 Yeah, I guess it's actually the best question because I spend seven days a week doing it.

39:34.320 --> 39:37.040
 You're the most prepared to answer it.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.840
 Yeah, but okay.

39:38.840 --> 39:43.920
 So the chair I'm sitting in is where I do...

39:43.920 --> 39:46.800
 That's where the magic happens.

39:46.800 --> 39:51.920
 I'm reading and writing, and the chair is usually sitting over there where I have some

39:51.920 --> 39:53.640
 reference book.

39:53.640 --> 40:00.400
 But I found this chair, which was designed by a Swedish guy anyway.

40:00.400 --> 40:03.960
 It turns out this is the only chair I can really sit in for hours and hours and not

40:03.960 --> 40:05.880
 know that I'm in a chair.

40:05.880 --> 40:11.320
 But then I have the standup desk right next to us, and so after I write something with

40:11.320 --> 40:21.240
 pencil and eraser, I get up and I type it and revise and rewrite, I'm standing up.

40:21.240 --> 40:24.200
 The kernel of the idea is first put on paper.

40:24.200 --> 40:25.200
 Yeah.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.200
 That's where...

40:26.200 --> 40:27.200
 Right.

40:27.200 --> 40:33.600
 And I'll write maybe five programs a week, of course, literate programming.

40:33.600 --> 40:38.680
 And before I describe something in my book, I always program it to see how it's working

40:38.680 --> 40:41.760
 and I try it a lot.

40:41.760 --> 40:49.600
 So for example, I learned at the end of January, I learned of a breakthrough by four Japanese

40:49.600 --> 40:54.800
 people who had extended one of my methods in a new direction.

40:54.800 --> 40:59.920
 And so I spent the next five days writing a program to implement what they did, and then

40:59.920 --> 41:00.920
 I...

41:00.920 --> 41:06.400
 But they had only generalized part of what I had done, so then I had to see if I could

41:06.400 --> 41:11.880
 generalize more parts of it and then I had to take their approach and I had to try it

41:11.880 --> 41:18.680
 out on a couple of dozen of the other problems I had already worked out with my old methods.

41:18.680 --> 41:26.760
 And so that took another couple of weeks and then I started to see the light and I started

41:26.760 --> 41:34.800
 writing the final draft and then I would type it up, involved some new mathematical questions

41:34.800 --> 41:41.400
 and so I wrote to my friends who might be good at solving those problems and they solved

41:41.400 --> 41:46.080
 some of them and so I put that in as exercises.

41:46.080 --> 41:54.080
 And so a month later, I had absorbed one new idea that I learned and I'm glad I heard

41:54.080 --> 41:59.080
 about it in time, otherwise I wouldn't put my book out before I'd heard about the idea.

41:59.080 --> 42:03.560
 On the other hand, this book was supposed to come in at 300 pages and I'm up to 350

42:03.560 --> 42:06.880
 now, that added 10 pages to the book.

42:06.880 --> 42:12.240
 But if I learn about another one, my publisher is going to shoot me.

42:12.240 --> 42:19.240
 Well, so in that process, in that one month process, are some days harder than others?

42:19.240 --> 42:21.400
 Are some days harder than others?

42:21.400 --> 42:22.400
 Well, yeah.

42:22.400 --> 42:28.040
 My work is fun, but I also work hard and every big job has parts that are a lot more fun

42:28.040 --> 42:29.400
 than others.

42:29.400 --> 42:35.200
 And so many days I'll say, why do I have to have such high standards?

42:35.200 --> 42:41.240
 Why couldn't I just be sloppy and not try this out and just report the answer?

42:41.240 --> 42:48.760
 But I know that people are calling me to do this and so, okay, so, okay, Don, I'll grit

42:48.760 --> 42:51.200
 my teeth and do it.

42:51.200 --> 42:57.520
 And then the joy comes out when I see that actually, I'm getting good results and I get

42:57.520 --> 43:03.720
 even more when I see that somebody has actually read and understood what I wrote and told

43:03.720 --> 43:05.640
 me how to make it even better.

43:05.640 --> 43:11.120
 I did want to mention something about the method.

43:11.120 --> 43:23.360
 So I got this tablet here where I do the first writing of concepts.

43:23.360 --> 43:27.880
 So, and what language is that then?

43:27.880 --> 43:28.880
 Right.

43:28.880 --> 43:29.880
 So take a look at it.

43:29.880 --> 43:36.120
 But you know, here, random say, explain how to draw such skewed pixel diagrams, okay.

43:36.120 --> 43:42.600
 I got this paper about 40 years ago when I was visiting my sister in Canada and they

43:42.600 --> 43:48.120
 make tablets of paper with this nice, large size and just the right size.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.920
 Very small space between line two minus five.

43:50.920 --> 43:54.520
 Maybe also just show it.

43:54.520 --> 43:55.520
 Yeah.

43:55.520 --> 43:56.520
 Yeah.

43:56.520 --> 43:57.520
 Wow.

43:57.520 --> 44:07.720
 You know, I've got these manuscripts going back to the 60s and those are when I get my

44:07.720 --> 44:09.480
 ideas on paper, okay.

44:09.480 --> 44:10.480
 But I'm a good typist.

44:10.480 --> 44:16.040
 In fact, I went to typing school when I was in high school and so I can type faster than

44:16.040 --> 44:17.040
 I think.

44:17.040 --> 44:23.920
 So then when I do the editing, you know, stand up and type, then I revise this and it comes

44:23.920 --> 44:28.960
 out a lot different than what, you know, for style and rhythm and things like that come

44:28.960 --> 44:31.120
 out at the typing stage.

44:31.120 --> 44:32.920
 And you type in tech.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.280
 And I type in tech.

44:34.280 --> 44:37.320
 And can you think in tech?

44:37.320 --> 44:38.320
 No.

44:38.320 --> 44:44.360
 So to a certain extent, I have only a small number of idioms that I use, like, you know,

44:44.360 --> 44:48.200
 I'm beginning with theorem, I do something for, just by the equation, I do something

44:48.200 --> 44:50.000
 and so on.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.360
 But I have to see it and.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.200
 In the way that it's on paper here.

44:55.200 --> 44:56.200
 Yeah, right.

44:56.200 --> 45:02.880
 So for example, Turing wrote what, the other direction, you don't write macros, you don't

45:02.880 --> 45:03.880
 think in macros.

45:03.880 --> 45:09.920
 Not particularly, but when I need a macro, I'll go ahead and do it.

45:09.920 --> 45:16.960
 But the thing is that I also write to fit, I mean, I'll change something if I can save

45:16.960 --> 45:17.960
 a line.

45:17.960 --> 45:23.160
 You know, it's like haiku, I'll figure out a way to rewrite the sentence so that it'll

45:23.160 --> 45:25.400
 look better on the page.

45:25.400 --> 45:31.080
 And I shouldn't be wasting my time on that, but I can't resist because I know it's only

45:31.080 --> 45:33.960
 another 3% of the time or something like that.

45:33.960 --> 45:38.800
 And it could also be argued that that is what life is about.

45:38.800 --> 45:46.520
 Ah, yes, in fact, that's true, like I worked in the garden one day a week and that's kind

45:46.520 --> 45:52.960
 of a description of my life is getting rid of weeds, you know, removing bugs for programs.

45:52.960 --> 45:57.640
 So you know, a lot of writers talk about, you know, basically suffering, the writing

45:57.640 --> 46:02.200
 process as having, you know, it's extremely difficult.

46:02.200 --> 46:07.800
 And I think of programming, especially the, or technical writing that you're doing can

46:07.800 --> 46:08.800
 be like that.

46:08.800 --> 46:13.600
 Do you find yourself methodologically?

46:13.600 --> 46:17.040
 How do you every day sit down to do the work?

46:17.040 --> 46:18.840
 Is it a challenge?

46:18.840 --> 46:24.920
 You kind of say it's, you know, it's fun.

46:24.920 --> 46:31.160
 But it'd be interesting to hear if there are non fun parts that you really struggle with.

46:31.160 --> 46:38.200
 Yeah, so the fun comes when I'm able to put together ideas of two people who didn't know

46:38.200 --> 46:39.960
 about each other.

46:39.960 --> 46:44.280
 And so I might be the first person that saw both of their ideas.

46:44.280 --> 46:50.560
 And so then, you know, then I get to make the synthesis and that gives me a chance to

46:50.560 --> 46:52.200
 be creative.

46:52.200 --> 46:57.840
 But the drudge worker is where I've got to chase everything down to its root.

46:57.840 --> 47:00.120
 This leads me into really interesting stuff.

47:00.120 --> 47:06.760
 I mean, I learn about Sanskrit and I, you know, I try to give credit to all the authors.

47:06.760 --> 47:14.560
 And so I write, so I write to people who know the people, authors if they're dead or I communicate

47:14.560 --> 47:16.280
 this way.

47:16.280 --> 47:18.800
 And I got to get the math right.

47:18.800 --> 47:22.960
 And I got to tackle all my programs, try to find holes in them.

47:22.960 --> 47:26.880
 And I rewrite the programs over after I get a better idea.

47:26.880 --> 47:29.080
 Is there ever dead ends?

47:29.080 --> 47:32.200
 Oh yeah, I throw stuff out, yeah.

47:32.200 --> 47:38.360
 One of the things that I spent a lot of time preparing, a major example based on the game

47:38.360 --> 47:40.600
 of baseball.

47:40.600 --> 47:46.920
 And I know a lot of people who, for whom baseball is the most important thing in the world.

47:46.920 --> 47:52.520
 But I also know a lot of people for whom cricket is the most important in the world or soccer

47:52.520 --> 47:55.040
 or something.

47:55.040 --> 47:59.760
 And I realized that if I had a big example, I mean, it was going to have a fold out illustration

47:59.760 --> 48:00.760
 and everything.

48:00.760 --> 48:05.880
 And I was saying, well, what am I really teaching about algorithms here where I had this baseball

48:05.880 --> 48:07.040
 example?

48:07.040 --> 48:12.560
 And if I was a person who knew only cricket, wouldn't they, what would they think about

48:12.560 --> 48:13.560
 this?

48:13.560 --> 48:19.040
 And so I've ripped the whole thing out, but I had something that would have really appealed

48:19.040 --> 48:23.880
 to people who grew up with baseball as a major theme in their life.

48:23.880 --> 48:29.160
 Which is a lot of people, but still a minority.

48:29.160 --> 48:30.160
 Small minority.

48:30.160 --> 48:33.480
 I took out bowling too.

48:33.480 --> 48:36.800
 Even a smaller minority.

48:36.800 --> 48:41.040
 What's the art in the art of programming?

48:41.040 --> 48:46.880
 Why is there, of the few words in the title, why is art one of them?

48:46.880 --> 48:52.080
 Well, that's what I wrote my touring lecture about.

48:52.080 --> 49:00.560
 And so when people talk about art, it really, I mean, what the word means is something that's

49:00.560 --> 49:02.560
 not in nature.

49:02.560 --> 49:09.760
 So when you have artificial intelligence, the art comes from the same root, saying that

49:09.760 --> 49:14.960
 this is something that was created by human beings.

49:14.960 --> 49:21.680
 And then it's gotten a further meaning of fine art, which has this beauty to the mix

49:21.680 --> 49:27.320
 and says, you know, we have things that are artistically done, and this means not only

49:27.320 --> 49:35.200
 done by humans, but also done in a way that's elegant and brings joy.

49:35.200 --> 49:49.000
 And has, I guess, Tolstoyber's Dostoevsky, but anyway, it's that part that says that

49:49.000 --> 49:54.120
 it's done well as well as not only different from nature.

49:54.120 --> 50:01.880
 In general, then, art is what human beings are specifically good at.

50:01.880 --> 50:07.440
 And when they say artificial intelligence, well, they're trying to mimic human beings.

50:07.440 --> 50:11.200
 But there's an element of fine art and beauty.

50:11.200 --> 50:12.200
 You are one.

50:12.200 --> 50:19.960
 And that's what I try to also say, that you can write a program and make a work of art.

50:19.960 --> 50:31.640
 So now, in terms of surprising, you know, what ideas in writing from sort and search

50:31.640 --> 50:40.480
 to the combinatorial algorithms, what ideas have you come across that were particularly

50:40.480 --> 50:48.240
 surprising to you, that changed the way you see a space of problems?

50:48.240 --> 50:52.640
 I get a surprise every time I have a bug in my program, obviously, but that isn't really

50:52.640 --> 50:53.640
 what you're at.

50:53.640 --> 50:57.200
 More transformational than surprising.

50:57.200 --> 51:03.400
 For example, in volume 4a, I was especially surprised when I learned about data structure

51:03.400 --> 51:15.080
 called BDD, Boolean Decision Diagram, because I sort of had the feeling that as an old timer,

51:15.080 --> 51:23.720
 and I've been programming since the 50s, and BDDs weren't invented until 1986.

51:23.720 --> 51:29.760
 And here comes a brand new idea that revolutionizes the way to represent a Boolean function.

51:29.760 --> 51:39.760
 Boolean functions are so basic to all kinds of things, I mean, logic underlies everything

51:39.760 --> 51:49.200
 we can describe, all of what we know in terms of logic somehow, and propositional logic.

51:49.200 --> 51:59.720
 I thought that was cut and dried and everything was known, but here comes Randy Bryant, and

51:59.720 --> 52:08.120
 he discovers that BDDs are incredibly powerful.

52:08.120 --> 52:14.320
 So that means I have a whole new section to the book that I never would have thought of

52:14.320 --> 52:26.400
 until 1986, not until 1990s, when people started to use it for a billion dollar of applications.

52:26.400 --> 52:32.840
 And it was the standard way to design computers for a long time until Satsalvers came along

52:32.840 --> 52:37.080
 in the year 2000, so that's another great big surprise.

52:37.080 --> 52:44.200
 So a lot of these things have totally changed the structure of my book, and the middle third

52:44.200 --> 52:56.040
 of volume 4b is about Satsalvers, and that's 300 plus pages, which is mostly about material

52:56.040 --> 52:59.480
 that was discovered in this century.

52:59.480 --> 53:07.000
 And I had to start from scratch and meet all the people in the field and write 15 different

53:07.000 --> 53:12.920
 Satsalvers that I wrote while preparing that, and seven of them are described in the book,

53:12.920 --> 53:16.160
 others were from my own experience.

53:16.160 --> 53:20.000
 So newly invented data structures or ways to represent?

53:20.000 --> 53:22.240
 A whole new class of algorithm.

53:22.240 --> 53:24.240
 A whole new class of algorithm.

53:24.240 --> 53:30.000
 Like the interesting thing about the BDDs was that the theoreticians started looking

53:30.000 --> 53:37.640
 at it and started to describe all the things you couldn't do with BDDs, and so they were

53:37.640 --> 53:48.200
 getting a bad name because they were useful, but they didn't solve every problem.

53:48.200 --> 53:54.360
 I'm sure that the theoreticians in the next 10 years are going to show why machine learning

53:54.360 --> 54:00.560
 doesn't solve everything, but I'm not only worried about the worst case, I get a huge

54:00.560 --> 54:05.600
 delight when I can actually solve a problem that I couldn't solve before, even though

54:05.600 --> 54:12.600
 I can't solve the problem that it suggests is a further problem, like I know that I'm

54:12.600 --> 54:14.160
 way better than I was before.

54:14.160 --> 54:20.040
 And so I found out that BDDs could do all kinds of miraculous things.

54:20.040 --> 54:31.080
 And so I had to spend quite a few years learning about that territory.

54:31.080 --> 54:38.600
 So in general, what brings you more pleasure, proving or showing a worst case analysis of

54:38.600 --> 54:46.520
 an algorithm or showing a good average case or just showing a good case, that something

54:46.520 --> 54:48.880
 good pragmatically can be done with this algorithm?

54:48.880 --> 54:54.640
 Yeah, I like a good case that is maybe only a million times faster than I was able to do

54:54.640 --> 55:03.000
 before, but not worry about the fact that it's still going to take too long if I double

55:03.000 --> 55:05.760
 the size of the problem.

55:05.760 --> 55:13.480
 So that said, you popularized the asymptotic notation for describing running time, obviously

55:13.480 --> 55:18.440
 in the analysis of algorithms, worst case is such an important part.

55:18.440 --> 55:26.080
 Do you see any aspects of that kind of analysis as lacking and notation too?

55:26.080 --> 55:33.200
 Well, the main purpose is to have notations that help us for the problems we want to solve.

55:33.200 --> 55:36.400
 And so that they match our intuitions.

55:36.400 --> 55:43.200
 And people who worked in number theory had used asymptotic notation in a certain way,

55:43.200 --> 55:46.760
 but it was only known to a small group of people.

55:46.760 --> 55:53.080
 And I realized that, in fact, it was very useful to be able to have a notation for something

55:53.080 --> 55:58.120
 that we don't know exactly what it is, but we only know partial about it and so on.

55:58.120 --> 56:05.440
 So for example, instead of big O notation, let's just take a much simpler notation where

56:05.440 --> 56:10.360
 I'd say zero or one or zero, one or two.

56:10.360 --> 56:16.520
 And suppose that when I had been in high school, we would be allowed to put in the middle of

56:16.520 --> 56:23.960
 our formula x plus zero, one or two equals y, okay?

56:23.960 --> 56:32.280
 And then we would learn how to multiply two such expressions together and deal with them.

56:32.280 --> 56:38.680
 Well, the same thing, big O notation says, here's something that I'm not sure what it

56:38.680 --> 56:44.120
 is, but I know it's not too big, I know it's not bigger than some constant times n squared

56:44.120 --> 56:45.120
 or something like that.

56:45.120 --> 56:47.480
 And so I write big O of n squared.

56:47.480 --> 56:52.240
 Now I learn how to add big O of n squared to big O of n cubed and I know how to add

56:52.240 --> 56:58.280
 big O of n squared to plus one and square that and how to take logarithms and exponentials

56:58.280 --> 57:00.760
 to have big O's in the middle of them.

57:00.760 --> 57:06.160
 And that turned out to be hugely valuable in all of the work that I was trying to do

57:06.160 --> 57:09.600
 is I'm trying to figure out how good an algorithm is.

57:09.600 --> 57:16.840
 So have there been algorithms in your journey that perform very differently in practice than

57:16.840 --> 57:18.320
 they do in theory?

57:18.320 --> 57:26.000
 Well, the worst case of a combinatorial algorithm is almost always horrible.

57:26.000 --> 57:32.880
 But we have SAT solvers that are solving one of the last exercises in that part of my book

57:32.880 --> 57:41.680
 was to figure out a problem that has a hundred variables that's difficult for a SAT solver.

57:41.680 --> 57:46.680
 But you would think that a problem with a hundred Boolean variables requires you to

57:46.680 --> 57:52.880
 do two to the one hundredth operations because that's the number of possibilities when you

57:52.880 --> 57:56.120
 have a hundred Boolean variables in two to the one hundredth.

57:56.120 --> 58:00.200
 Two to the one hundredth is way bigger than we can handle.

58:00.200 --> 58:03.560
 Ten to the seventeenth is a lot.

58:03.560 --> 58:08.620
 You've mentioned over the past few years that you believe P may be equal to NP.

58:08.620 --> 58:14.880
 But that is not really, you know, if somebody does prove that P equals NP, it will not directly

58:14.880 --> 58:20.080
 lead to an actual algorithm to solve difficult problems.

58:20.080 --> 58:21.680
 Can you explain your intuition here?

58:21.680 --> 58:23.680
 Has it been changed?

58:23.680 --> 58:28.320
 And in general, on the difference between easy and difficult problems of P and NP and so

58:28.320 --> 58:29.320
 on?

58:29.320 --> 58:30.320
 Yeah.

58:30.320 --> 58:38.800
 So the popular idea is if an algorithm exists, then somebody will find it.

58:38.800 --> 58:44.840
 And it's just a matter of writing it down.

58:44.840 --> 58:53.520
 But many more algorithms exist than anybody can understand or discover.

58:53.520 --> 59:01.560
 Because they're just way beyond human comprehension, the total number of algorithms is more than

59:01.560 --> 59:04.600
 mind boggling.

59:04.600 --> 59:10.440
 So we have situations now where we know that algorithm exists, but we don't know the

59:10.440 --> 59:13.760
 farthest idea what the algorithms are.

59:13.760 --> 59:24.360
 There are simple examples based on game playing where you say, well, there must be an algorithm

59:24.360 --> 59:29.640
 that exists to win in the game of Hex for the first player to win in the game of Hex

59:29.640 --> 59:35.080
 because Hex is always either a win for the first player or the second player.

59:35.080 --> 59:36.080
 But what's the game of Hex?

59:36.080 --> 59:42.720
 There's a game of Hex which is based on putting pebbles onto a hexagonal board and the white

59:42.720 --> 59:47.280
 player tries to get a white path from left to right and the black player tries to get

59:47.280 --> 59:49.760
 a black path from bottom to top.

59:49.760 --> 59:52.240
 And how does capture occur?

59:52.240 --> 59:53.240
 And there's no capture.

59:53.240 --> 59:56.280
 You just put pebbles down one at a time.

59:56.280 --> 1:00:00.320
 But there's no draws because after all the white and black are played, there's either

1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:05.840
 going to be a white path across from each to west or a black path from bottom to top.

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:15.360
 So it's a perfect information game and people take turns like Tic Tac Toe.

1:00:15.360 --> 1:00:22.040
 And the hex board can be different sizes, but there's no possibility of a draw.

1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:24.640
 And players move one at a time.

1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:28.360
 And so it's got to be either a first player win or a second player win.

1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:34.360
 Mathematically, you follow out all the trees and either there's always a win for the first

1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:36.240
 player, second player, okay.

1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:37.240
 And it's finite.

1:00:37.240 --> 1:00:38.760
 The game is finite.

1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:41.640
 So there's an algorithm that will decide.

1:00:41.640 --> 1:00:45.920
 You can show it has to be one or the other because the second player could mimic the

1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:50.120
 first player with kind of a pairing strategy.

1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:56.600
 And so you can show that it has to be one or the other.

1:00:56.600 --> 1:00:58.800
 But we don't know any algorithm anyway.

1:00:58.800 --> 1:00:59.800
 We don't know.

1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:07.680
 There are cases where you can prove the existence of a solution, but nobody knows anyway how

1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:08.960
 to find it.

1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:15.480
 More like the algorithm question, there's a very powerful theorem in graph theory by

1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:24.200
 Robinson and Seymour that says that every class of graphs that is closed under taking

1:01:24.200 --> 1:01:31.560
 minors has a polynomial time algorithm to determine whether it's in this class or not.

1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:34.840
 Now a class of graphs, for example, planar graphs, these are graphs that you can draw

1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:38.680
 in a plane without crossing lines.

1:01:38.680 --> 1:01:46.040
 And the planar graph, taking minors means that you can shrink an edge into a point or

1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:49.320
 you can delete an edge.

1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:54.640
 And so you start with a planar graph and shrink any edge to a point, it's still planar.

1:01:54.640 --> 1:01:58.720
 Deleting an edge is still planar, okay.

1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:11.640
 But there are millions of different ways to describe a family of graphs that still remains

1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:14.280
 the same under taking minors.

1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:20.080
 And Robinson and Seymour proved that any such family of graphs, there's a finite number

1:02:20.080 --> 1:02:31.760
 of minimum graphs that are obstructions so that if it's not in the family, then it has

1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:37.880
 to contain, then there has to be a way to shrink it down until you get one of these

1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:41.840
 bad minimum graphs that's not in the family.

1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:47.160
 In the case of a planar graph, the minimum graph is a five point star where everything

1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:52.320
 points to another and the minimum graph consisting of trying to connect three utilities to three

1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:54.680
 houses without crossing lines.

1:02:54.680 --> 1:03:01.040
 And so there are two bad graphs that are not planar and every nonplanar graph contains

1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:07.040
 one of these two bad graphs by shrinking and removing edges.

1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:11.640
 Sorry, can you say that again so he proved that there's a finite number of these bad

1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:12.640
 graphs?

1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:13.640
 There's always a finite number.

1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:15.240
 So somebody says, here's a family of...

1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:17.720
 It's hard to believe.

1:03:17.720 --> 1:03:25.320
 And they proved the next sequence of 20 papers, I mean, and it's deep work, but it's...

1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:27.440
 Because that's for any arbitrary class.

1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:28.440
 So it's for any class.

1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:31.160
 Any arbitrary class that's closed under taking minors.

1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:32.640
 That's closed under...

1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:36.120
 Maybe I'm not understanding because it seems like a lot of them are closed under taking

1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:37.120
 minors.

1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:39.960
 Almost all the important classes of graphs are.

1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:48.040
 There are tons of such graphs, but also hundreds of them that arise in applications.

1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:52.960
 I have a book over here called Classes of Graphs.

1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:58.760
 And it's amazing how many different classes of graphs that people have looked at.

1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:02.600
 So why do you bring up this theorem, lower this proof?

1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:07.440
 So now there's lots of algorithms that are known for special class of graphs.

1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:13.760
 For example, if I have a chordal graph, then I can color it efficiently.

1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:18.800
 If I have some kinds of graphs, it'll make a great network of various things.

1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:22.000
 So you'd like to test...

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.720
 Somebody gives you a graph that's always in this family of graphs.

1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:30.880
 If so, then I can go to the library and find an algorithm that's going to solve my problem

1:04:30.880 --> 1:04:33.160
 on that graph.

1:04:33.160 --> 1:04:34.160
 Okay.

1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:43.520
 So we want to have a graph that says, an algorithm that says, you give me a graph, I'll tell

1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:48.960
 you whether it's in this family or not.

1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:55.360
 And so all I have to do is test whether or not that does this given graph have a minor

1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:56.840
 that's one of the bad ones.

1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:01.880
 A minor is everything you can get by shrinking and removing it.

1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:06.160
 And given any minor, there's a polynomial time algorithm saying, I can tell whether

1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:09.720
 this is a minor of you.

1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:11.760
 And there's a finite number of bad cases.

1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:16.680
 So I just try, you know, does it have this bad case, polynomial time, I got the answer.

1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:23.480
 Does it have this bad case, polynomial time, I got the answer, total polynomial time.

1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:25.080
 And so I've solved the problem.

1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:28.680
 However, all we know is that the number of minors is finite.

1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:33.120
 We don't know what, we might only know one or two of those minors, but we don't know

1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:41.520
 that if we've got 20 of them, we don't know there might be 21, 25, all we know is that

1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:42.760
 it's finite.

1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:46.560
 So here we have a polynomial time algorithm that we don't know.

1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:51.760
 That's a really great example of what you worry about or why you think p equals NP won't

1:05:51.760 --> 1:06:00.200
 be useful, but still, why do you hold the intuition that p equals NP?

1:06:00.200 --> 1:06:12.080
 Because you have to rule out so many possible algorithms as being not working.

1:06:12.080 --> 1:06:18.440
 You can take the graph and you can represent it in terms of certain prime numbers and then

1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:28.400
 you can multiply those together and then you can take the bitwise and construct some certain

1:06:28.400 --> 1:06:33.440
 constant and polynomial time and that's a perfectly valid algorithm.

1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:45.160
 And there are so many algorithms of that kind, a lot of times we see random take data and

1:06:45.160 --> 1:06:56.400
 we get coincidences that some fairly random looking number actually is useful because it

1:06:56.400 --> 1:07:09.400
 happens to solve a problem just because there's so many hairs on your head, but it seems like

1:07:09.400 --> 1:07:15.280
 unlikely that two people are going to have the same number of hairs on their head.

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:20.280
 But you can count how many people there are and how many hairs on their head.

1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:23.720
 So there must be people walking around in the country that have the same number of hairs

1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:24.720
 on their head.

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:30.280
 Well, that's kind of a coincidence that you might say also this particular combination

1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:36.840
 of operations just happens to prove that a graph has a Hamiltonian path.

1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:43.400
 I see lots of cases where unexpected things happen when you have enough possibilities.

1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:48.080
 So because the space of possibility is so huge, your intuition just says it's not.

1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:52.360
 They have to rule them all out and so that's the reason for my intuition.

1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:53.360
 By no means approve.

1:07:53.360 --> 1:08:02.960
 I mean, some people say, well, P can't equal NP because you've had all these smart people.

1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:09.400
 The smartest designers of algorithms have been racking their brains for years and years

1:08:09.400 --> 1:08:16.320
 and there's a million dollar prizes out there and none of them, nobody has thought of algorithms.

1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:19.320
 So it must be no such algorithm.

1:08:19.320 --> 1:08:25.360
 On the other hand, I can use exactly the same logic and I can say, well, P must be equal

1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:28.640
 to NP because there are so many smart people out here that have been trying to prove it

1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:34.480
 unequal to NP and they've all failed.

1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:39.480
 This kind of reminds me of the discussion about the search for aliens that we've been

1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:44.040
 trying to look for them and we haven't found them yet therefore they don't exist, but

1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:50.520
 you can show that there's so many planets out there that they very possibly could exist.

1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:57.040
 Then there's also the possibility that they exist, but they all discovered machine learning

1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:01.160
 or something and then blew each other up.

1:09:01.160 --> 1:09:05.400
 On that small quick tangent, let me ask, do you think there's intelligent life out there

1:09:05.400 --> 1:09:06.960
 in the universe?

1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:08.400
 I have no idea.

1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:09.400
 Do you hope so?

1:09:09.400 --> 1:09:11.360
 Do you think about it?

1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:16.960
 I don't spend my time thinking about things that I could never know really.

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:20.400
 And yet you do enjoy the fact that there's many things you don't know.

1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:23.720
 You do enjoy the mystery of things.

1:09:23.720 --> 1:09:33.200
 I enjoy the fact that I have limits, yeah, but I don't take time to answer unsolvable

1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:34.200
 questions.

1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:35.200
 Got it.

1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:40.560
 Well, because you've taken on some tough questions that may seem unsolvable.

1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:44.800
 You have taken on some tough questions that may seem unsolvable, but they're in the space.

1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:49.080
 It gives me a thrill when I can get further than I ever thought I could.

1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:50.840
 But I don't.

1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:52.960
 But much like with religion.

1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:58.560
 I'm glad that there's no proof that God exists or not.

1:09:58.560 --> 1:09:59.560
 I think...

1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:00.560
 It's spoiled the mystery.

1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:04.400
 It'll be too dull, yeah.

1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:14.640
 So to quickly talk about the other art of artificial intelligence, what's your view?

1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:18.520
 Artificial intelligence community has developed as part of computer science and in parallel

1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:21.640
 with computer science since the 60s.

1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:27.200
 What's your view of the AI community from the 60s to now?

1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:35.080
 So all the way through, it was the people who were inspired by trying to mimic intelligence

1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:40.680
 or to do things that were somehow the greatest achievements of intelligence that had been

1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:48.080
 inspiration to people who have pushed the envelope of computer science, maybe more than

1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:50.400
 any other group of people.

1:10:50.400 --> 1:11:01.240
 So all the way through, it's been a great source of good problems to sink teeth into

1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:10.680
 and getting partial answers and then more and more successful answers over the years.

1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:16.440
 So this has been the inspiration for lots of the great discoveries of computer science.

1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:23.200
 Are you yourself captivated by the possibility of creating, of algorithms having echoes of

1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:27.040
 intelligence in them?

1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:33.200
 Not as much as most of the people in the field, I guess I would say, but that's not to say

1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:39.920
 that they're wrong or that it's just you asked about my own personal preferences.

1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:52.480
 But the thing that I worry about is when people start believing that they've actually succeeded

1:11:52.480 --> 1:12:02.160
 and because there seems to be this huge gap between really understanding something and

1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:08.280
 being able to pretend to understand something and give the illusion of understanding something.

1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:11.360
 Everything is possible to create without understanding.

1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:12.360
 Yeah.

1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:24.160
 I do that all the time too, I mean, that's why I use random numbers, but there's still

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:25.160
 this great gap.

1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:35.640
 I don't assert that it's impossible, but I don't see anything coming any closer to really

1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:38.440
 the kind of stuff that I would consider intelligence.

1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:45.080
 So you've mentioned something that on that line of thinking, which I very much agree

1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:46.080
 with.

1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:52.760
 So the art of computer programming as the book is focused on single processor algorithms

1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:57.720
 and for the most part, you mentioned...

1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:00.960
 That's only because I set the table of contents in 1962.

1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:01.960
 You have to remember.

1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:02.960
 For sure.

1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:03.960
 There's no...

1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:09.800
 I'm glad I didn't wait until 1965 or something.

1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:15.840
 One book, maybe we'll touch on the Bible, but one book can't always cover the entirety

1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:17.200
 of everything.

1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:26.240
 So I'm glad the table of contents for the art of computer programming is what it is.

1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:31.720
 But you did mention that you thought that understanding of the way ant colonies are

1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:37.760
 able to perform incredibly organized tasks might well be the key to understanding human

1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:38.760
 cognition.

1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:42.160
 So these fundamentally distributed systems.

1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:48.080
 So what do you think is the difference between the way Don Knuth would sort a list and an

1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:53.160
 ant colony would sort a list or perform an algorithm?

1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:58.160
 Sorting a list isn't the same as cognition though, but I know what you're getting at

1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:05.280
 there, so the advantage of ant colony, at least we can see what they're doing.

1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:13.680
 We know which ant has talked to which other ant and it's much harder with the brains to

1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:18.360
 know to what extent neurons are passing signal.

1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:21.800
 So I'm just saying that ant colony might be...

1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:29.720
 If they have the secret of cognition, think of an ant colony as a cognitive single being

1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:35.120
 rather than as a colony of lots of different ants, I mean just like the cells of our brain

1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:46.680
 are and the microbiome and all that is interacting entities, but somehow I consider myself to

1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:48.600
 be a single person.

1:14:48.600 --> 1:15:01.680
 So an ant colony, you can say, might be cognitive and somehow and I mean, okay, I smash a certain

1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:06.960
 ant and the organism thinks, hmm, that's stung, what was that?

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:12.840
 But if we're going to crack the secret of cognition, it might be that we could do so

1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:20.440
 by psyching out how ants do it because we have a better chance to measure, they're communicating

1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:27.520
 by pheromones and by touching each other and psych, but not by much more subtle phenomenon

1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:30.400
 like current's going through.

1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:35.200
 But even a simpler version of that, what are your thoughts of maybe Conway's game of life?

1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:45.560
 Okay, so Conway's game of life is able to simulate any computable process and any deterministic

1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:46.560
 process is...

1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:47.880
 I like how you went there.

1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:56.840
 I mean, that's not its most powerful thing I would say, I mean, they can simulate it,

1:15:56.840 --> 1:16:03.880
 but the magic is that the individual units are distributed and extremely simple.

1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:06.960
 Yes, we understand exactly what the primitives are.

1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:09.680
 The primitives, just like with the ant colony, even simpler though.

1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:23.960
 But still, it doesn't say that I understand life, I mean, it gives me a better insight

1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:30.120
 into what does it mean to have a deterministic universe?

1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:34.920
 What does it mean to have free choice, for example?

1:16:34.920 --> 1:16:37.880
 So do you think God plays dice?

1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:38.880
 Yes.

1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:45.840
 I don't see any reason why God should be forbidden from using the most efficient ways to...

1:16:45.840 --> 1:16:54.800
 I mean, we know that dice are extremely important in efficient algorithms.

1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:58.920
 There are things that couldn't be done well without randomness, and so I don't see any

1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:03.880
 reason why God should be prohibited from...

1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:11.560
 When the algorithm requires it, you don't see why the physics should constrain it.

1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:17.120
 So in 2001, you gave a series of lectures at MIT about religion and science.

1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:19.440
 No, that was 1999.

1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:20.440
 You published...

1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:21.440
 Sorry.

1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:22.840
 The book came out in 2001.

1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:31.120
 So in 1999, you spent a little bit of time in Boston enough to give those lectures.

1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:36.360
 And I read in the 2001 version, most of it.

1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:37.360
 It's quite fascinating to read.

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:40.920
 I recommend people, it's transcription review lectures.

1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:45.960
 So what did you learn about how ideas get started and grow from studying the history

1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:46.960
 of the Bible?

1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:52.400
 So you've rigorously studied a very particular part of the Bible.

1:17:52.400 --> 1:17:57.200
 What did you learn from this process about the way us human beings as a society develop

1:17:57.200 --> 1:18:01.560
 and grow ideas, share ideas, and define by those ideas?

1:18:01.560 --> 1:18:04.600
 Well, it's hard to summarize that.

1:18:04.600 --> 1:18:11.520
 I wouldn't say that I learned a great deal of really definite things where I could make

1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:15.000
 conclusions, but I learned more about what I don't know.

1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:21.800
 You have a complex subject which is really beyond human understanding.

1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:25.480
 So we give up on saying, I'm ever going to get to the end of the road and I'm ever going

1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:32.240
 to understand it, but you say, but maybe it might be good for me to get closer and closer

1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:34.520
 and learn more and more about something.

1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:39.480
 And so how can I do that efficiently?

1:18:39.480 --> 1:18:44.440
 And the answer is, well, use randomness.

1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:57.200
 And so try a random subset of that that is within my grasp and study that in detail instead

1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:04.320
 of just studying parts that somebody tells me to study or instead of studying nothing

1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:07.080
 because it's too hard.

1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:20.880
 So I decided for my own amusement once that I would take a subset of the verses of the

1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:30.000
 Bible and I would try to find out what the best thinkers have said about that small subset.

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:36.680
 And I had about, let's say, 60 verses out of 3,000, I think is one out of 500 or something

1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:37.800
 like this.

1:19:37.800 --> 1:19:43.440
 And so then I went to the libraries, which are well indexed.

1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:52.400
 I spent, for example, at Boston Public Library, I would go once a week for a year.

1:19:52.400 --> 1:20:01.000
 And I went to have done timestuck and over Harvard Library to look at this book that

1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:08.400
 weren't in the Boston Public, where scholars had looked and you can go down the shelves

1:20:08.400 --> 1:20:15.480
 and you can look at the index and say, oh, is this verse mentioned anywhere in this book?

1:20:15.480 --> 1:20:17.680
 If so, look at page 105.

1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:22.520
 So in other words, I could learn not only about the Bible but about the secondary literature

1:20:22.520 --> 1:20:26.160
 about the Bible, the things that scholars have written about it.

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:36.840
 And so that gave me a way to zoom in on parts of the things so that I could get more insight.

1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:44.760
 And so I look at it as a way of giving me some firm pegs, which I could hang pieces

1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:50.960
 of information but not as things where I would say, and therefore this is true.

1:20:50.960 --> 1:21:01.360
 In this random approach of sampling the Bible, what did you learn about the most, you know,

1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:05.920
 central, one of the biggest accumulation of ideas in our...

1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:13.320
 To me, that the main thrust was not the one that most people think of as saying, you know,

1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:16.280
 don't have sex or something like this.

1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:26.760
 But that the main thrust was to try to figure out how to live in harmony with God's wishes.

1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:32.280
 I'm assuming that God exists and as I say, I'm glad that there's no way to prove this

1:21:32.280 --> 1:21:43.840
 because I would run through the proof once and then I'd forget it and I would never speculate

1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:51.440
 about spiritual things and mysteries otherwise and I think my life would be very incomplete.

1:21:51.440 --> 1:22:02.200
 So I'm assuming that God exists, but a lot of the people say God doesn't exist but that's

1:22:02.200 --> 1:22:09.200
 still important to them and so in a way that might still be whether God is there or not.

1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:14.760
 In some sense, God is important to them.

1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:19.880
 One of the verses I studied, you can interpret it as saying, you know, it's much better

1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:25.040
 to be an atheist than not to care at all.

1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:29.960
 So I would say it's similar to the P equals NP discussion.

1:22:29.960 --> 1:22:37.080
 You mentioned a mental exercise that I'd love it if you could partake in yourself, a mental

1:22:37.080 --> 1:22:42.960
 exercise of being God and so how would you, if you were God, Dr. Nuth, how would you present

1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:45.280
 yourself to the people of earth?

1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:51.560
 You mentioned your love of literature and there's this book that really I can recommend

1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:52.560
 to you.

1:22:52.560 --> 1:22:55.800
 Yeah, the title I think is Blasphemy.

1:22:55.800 --> 1:23:08.200
 It talks about God revealing himself through a computer in Los Alamos and it's the only

1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:15.360
 book that I've ever read where the punchline was really the very last word of the book

1:23:15.360 --> 1:23:21.120
 and explained the whole idea of the book and so I don't want to give that away, but it's

1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:27.640
 really very much about this question that you raised.

1:23:27.640 --> 1:23:37.400
 But suppose God said, okay, my previous means of communication with the world are not the

1:23:37.400 --> 1:23:42.800
 best for the 21st century, so what should I do now?

1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:51.040
 And it's conceivable that God would choose the way that's described in this book.

1:23:51.040 --> 1:23:55.280
 And another way to look at this exercise is looking at the human mind, looking at the

1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:59.200
 human spirit, the human life in a systematic way.

1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:03.920
 I think it mostly, you want to learn humility, you want to realize that once we solve one

1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:10.600
 problem that doesn't mean that all of a sudden other problems are going to drop out and we

1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:22.160
 have to realize that there are things beyond our ability.

1:24:22.160 --> 1:24:25.560
 I see hubris all around.

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:28.720
 Yeah, well said.

1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:36.200
 If you were to run program analysis on your own life, how did you do in terms of correctness,

1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:41.360
 spending time, resource use, asymptotically speaking, of course.

1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:42.360
 Okay, yeah.

1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:50.800
 Well, I would say that question has not been asked me before.

1:24:50.800 --> 1:25:07.440
 And I started out with library subroutines and learning how to be a automaton that was

1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:18.680
 obedient, and I had the great advantage that I didn't have anybody to blame for my failures

1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:24.320
 if I started getting, not understanding something, I knew that I should stop playing ping pong

1:25:24.320 --> 1:25:30.200
 and it was my fault that I wasn't studying hard enough or something, rather than that

1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:33.120
 somebody was discriminating against me in some way.

1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:40.920
 And I don't know how to avoid the existence of biases in the world, but I know that that's

1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:47.800
 an extra burden that I didn't have to suffer from.

1:25:47.800 --> 1:26:03.320
 Then I found the, from parents, I learned the idea of service to other people as being

1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:10.280
 more important than what I get out of stuff myself.

1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:21.280
 I know that I need to be happy enough in order to be able to be of service, but I came to

1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:29.400
 a philosophy finally that I phrase as point eight is enough.

1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:36.680
 There was a TV show once called Eight is Enough, which was about, somebody had eight kids.

1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:44.840
 But I say point eight is enough, which means if I can have a way of rating happiness, I

1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:56.280
 think it's good design to have an organism that's happy about 80% of the time.

1:26:56.280 --> 1:27:05.200
 And if it was 100% of the time, it would be like everybody's on drugs and everything

1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:09.440
 collapses and nothing works because everybody's just too happy.

1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:13.320
 Do you think you've achieved that point eight optimal balance?

1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:21.640
 There are times when I'm down and I know that I'm chemically, I know that I've actually

1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:28.400
 been programmed to be depressed a certain amount of time.

1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:33.440
 And if that gets out of kilter and I'm more depressed than usual, sometimes I find myself

1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:36.120
 trying to think, now, who should I be mad at today?

1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:43.920
 There must be a reason why I'm, but then I realize, it's just my chemistry telling

1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:48.160
 me that I'm supposed to be mad at somebody and so I truck it up and say, okay, go to

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:56.600
 sleep and get better, but if I'm not 100% happy, that doesn't mean that I should find

1:27:56.600 --> 1:28:06.080
 somebody that's screaming and try to silence them, but I'm saying, okay, I'm not 100%

1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:15.360
 happy, but I'm happy enough to be a part of a sustainable situation.

1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:20.480
 So that's kind of the numerical analysis I do.

1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:25.520
 You've converged towards the optimal, which for human life is a point eight.

1:28:25.520 --> 1:28:32.680
 I hope it's okay to talk about, as you talked about previously in 2006, you were diagnosed

1:28:32.680 --> 1:28:34.800
 with prostate cancer.

1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:40.080
 Has that encounter with mortality changed you in some way or the way you see the world?

1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:41.760
 Well, yeah, it did.

1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:47.840
 The first encounter with mortality when my dad died and I went through a month when

1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:59.520
 I sort of came to be comfortable with the fact that I was going to die someday.

1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:12.400
 And during that month, I don't know, I felt okay, but I couldn't sing and I couldn't do

1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:19.320
 original research either, like I sort of remember after three or four weeks, the first time

1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:24.840
 I started having a technical thought that made sense and was maybe slightly creative.

1:29:24.840 --> 1:29:31.080
 I could sort of feel that something was starting to move again, but that was, you know, so

1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:39.920
 I felt very empty until I came to grips with the, I learned that this is sort of a standard

1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:42.520
 grief process that people go through.

1:29:42.520 --> 1:29:50.120
 Okay, so then now I'm at a point in my life, even more so than in 2006, where all of my

1:29:50.120 --> 1:29:58.600
 goals have been fulfilled except for finishing the art of computer programming.

1:29:58.600 --> 1:30:06.960
 I had one major unfulfilled goal that I'd wanted all my life to write a piece of music

1:30:06.960 --> 1:30:13.680
 that, and I had an idea for a certain kind of music that I thought ought to be written,

1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:20.120
 at least somebody ought to try to do it, and I felt that it wasn't going to be easy, but

1:30:20.120 --> 1:30:26.120
 I wanted it proof of concept, I wanted to know if it was going to work or not, and so

1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:33.960
 I spent a lot of time, and finally I finished that piece, and we had the world premiere

1:30:33.960 --> 1:30:38.480
 last year on my 80th birthday, and we had another premiere in Canada, and there's talk

1:30:38.480 --> 1:30:43.320
 of concerts in Europe and various things, so that, but that's done.

1:30:43.320 --> 1:30:49.120
 It's part of the world's music now, and it's either good or bad, but I did what I was hoping

1:30:49.120 --> 1:30:50.240
 to do.

1:30:50.240 --> 1:31:00.120
 So the only thing that I have on my agenda is to try to do as well as I can with the

1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:02.400
 art of computer programming until I go see now.

1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:06.920
 Do you think there's an element of 0.8 that might apply there?

1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:07.920
 0.8?

1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:08.920
 Yeah.

1:31:08.920 --> 1:31:24.360
 Well, I look at it more that I got actually to 1.0 when that concert was over with.

1:31:24.360 --> 1:31:31.760
 So in 2006 I was at 0.8, so when I was diagnosed with prostate cancer, then I said, okay, well

1:31:31.760 --> 1:31:39.560
 maybe this is, you know, I've had all kinds of good luck all my life, and I have nothing

1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:45.160
 to complain about, so I might die now, and we'll see what happens.

1:31:45.160 --> 1:31:58.080
 And so it's quite seriously, I had no expectation that I deserved better, I didn't make any

1:31:58.080 --> 1:31:59.720
 plans for the future.

1:31:59.720 --> 1:32:10.560
 I had my surgery, I came out of the surgery and spent some time learning how to walk again

1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:15.880
 and so on, it was painful for a while.

1:32:15.880 --> 1:32:21.160
 But I got home and I realized I hadn't really thought about what to do next.

1:32:21.160 --> 1:32:27.480
 I hadn't any expectations, I said, okay, hey, I'm still alive, okay, now I can write

1:32:27.480 --> 1:32:35.320
 some more books, but I didn't come with the attitude that, you know, this was terribly

1:32:35.320 --> 1:32:48.560
 unfair and I just said, okay, I was accepting whatever turned out, you know, I had gotten

1:32:48.560 --> 1:32:57.440
 more than my share already, so why should I, why should I, and I didn't, and I really

1:32:57.440 --> 1:33:01.800
 thought, when I got home, I realized that I had really not thought about the next step,

1:33:01.800 --> 1:33:07.440
 what I would do after I would be able to work again, I'd sort of thought of it as if this

1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:16.320
 might, you know, I was comfortable with the fact that it was at the end, but I was hoping

1:33:16.320 --> 1:33:28.320
 that I would still, you know, be able to learn about satisfiability and also someday even

1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:29.320
 write music.

1:33:29.320 --> 1:33:33.640
 I didn't start seriously on the music project until 2012.

1:33:33.640 --> 1:33:40.320
 So I'm going to be in huge trouble if I don't talk to you about this.

1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:45.000
 In the 70s, you've created the tech typesetting system together with MetaFont language for

1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:50.080
 font description and computer modern family of typefaces.

1:33:50.080 --> 1:33:57.040
 That has basically defined the methodology in the aesthetic of the countless research

1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:02.360
 fields, right, math, physics, well, beyond computer science, so on.

1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:05.320
 Okay, well, first of all, thank you.

1:34:05.320 --> 1:34:11.840
 I think I speak for a lot of people in saying that, but a question in terms of beauty, there's

1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:20.840
 a beauty to typography that you've created, and yet beauty is hard to quantify.

1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:25.400
 How does one create beautiful letters and beautiful equations?

1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:33.200
 Like what, well, so, I mean, perhaps there's no words to be describing, be describing the

1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:35.440
 process, but.

1:34:35.440 --> 1:34:44.880
 So the great Harvard mathematician, George Deberg, wrote a book in the 30s called Aesthetic

1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:50.160
 Measure where he would have pictures of vases and underneath would be a number, and this

1:34:50.160 --> 1:34:55.600
 was how beautiful the vase was, and he had a formula for this.

1:34:55.600 --> 1:35:01.800
 And he actually also wrote about music, and so he could, you know, so I thought maybe

1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:08.880
 I would, for part of my musical composition, I would try to program his algorithms and,

1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:14.480
 you know, so that I would write something that had the highest number by his score.

1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:20.280
 Well, it wasn't quite rigorous enough for a computer to do, but anyway, people have

1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:29.160
 tried to put numerical value on beauty, but, and he did probably the most serious attempt

1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:36.240
 and, and George Gershwin's teacher also wrote two vines where he talked about his method

1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:42.480
 of composing music, but you're talking about another kind of beauty and beauty and letters

1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:43.480
 and letters.

1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:46.280
 Elegance and whatever that curvature is.

1:35:46.280 --> 1:35:47.280
 Right.

1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:55.400
 So, so, and so that's the beholder, as they say, but kind of striving for excellence and

1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:59.520
 whatever definition you want to give to beauty, then you try to get as close to that as you

1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:07.360
 can somehow with, I guess, I guess I'm trying to ask, and there may not be a good answer.

1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:12.000
 What loose definitions were you operating under with the community of people that you

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:13.000
 were working on?

1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:21.400
 Oh, the loose definition, I wanted, I wanted it to appeal to me, to me, I mean, to you

1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:22.400
 personally.

1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:23.400
 Yeah.

1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:24.400
 That's a good start.

1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:30.240
 I mean, failed that test when I got, volume two came out with the new printing and I was

1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:39.080
 expecting it to be the happiest day of my life and I felt like a burning, like how angry

1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:47.000
 I was that I opened the book and it was in the same beige covers, but it didn't look

1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:50.800
 right on the page.

1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:52.640
 The number two was particularly ugly.

1:36:52.640 --> 1:36:58.520
 I couldn't stand any page, it had a two in its page number and I was expecting that it

1:36:58.520 --> 1:37:05.840
 was, you know, I spent all this time making measurements and I had looked at stuff in

1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:15.200
 different ways and I had great technology, but it didn't, you know, but I wasn't done.

1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:20.280
 I had to retune the whole thing after 1961.

1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:22.160
 Has it ever made you happy, finally?

1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:23.160
 Oh, yes.

1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:26.680
 Or is it a point eight?

1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:31.400
 No, no, and so many books have come out that would never have been written without this.

1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:37.840
 I just, it's just, it's just, it's a joy, but I can, but now I, I mean, all these pages

1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:44.440
 that are sitting up there, I don't have a, if I didn't like them, I would change them.

1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:48.400
 That's my, nobody else has this ability.

1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:50.880
 They have to stick with what I gave them.

1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:56.920
 So, in terms of the other side of it, there's the typography, so the look of the type and

1:37:56.920 --> 1:38:00.040
 the curves and the lines.

1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:01.840
 What about the spacing?

1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:02.840
 What about the?

1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:03.840
 The spacing.

1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:04.840
 Spacing, yeah.

1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:05.840
 The white space.

1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:06.840
 Yeah.

1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:11.160
 It seems like you could be a little bit more systematic about the layout or technical.

1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:16.040
 Oh yeah, you can always go further.

1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:21.320
 I didn't, I didn't stop at point eight, I stopped, but I stopped at about point nine

1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:22.320
 eight.

1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:26.520
 It seems like you're not following your own rule for happiness.

1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:27.520
 Or is...

1:38:27.520 --> 1:38:35.800
 No, no, no, I, there is, okay, of course there's this, what is it, Japanese word, wabi sabi

1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:42.160
 or something, where the most beautiful works of art are those that have flaws because

1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:50.560
 then the person who perceives them adds their own appreciation and that give the viewer

1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:53.520
 more satisfaction or so on.

1:38:53.520 --> 1:39:00.760
 But I, but no, no, with typography, I wanted it to look as good as I could in the vast

1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:02.240
 majority of cases.

1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:11.840
 And then when it doesn't, then I say, okay, that's 2% more work for the author.

1:39:11.840 --> 1:39:19.040
 But I didn't want to, I didn't want to say that my job was to get 200% with and take

1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:20.800
 all the work away from the author.

1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:22.680
 That's what I meant by that.

1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:30.000
 So if you were to venture a guess, how much of the nature of reality do you think we humans

1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:31.000
 understand?

1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:34.400
 So you mentioned you appreciate mystery.

1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:38.360
 How much of the world about us is shrouded in mystery?

1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:45.000
 Are we, if you were to put a number on it, what percent of it all do we understand?

1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:46.000
 Are we totally?

1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:52.600
 How many leading zeros do you point, 0.00, I don't know, no, I think it's infinitesimal.

1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:53.600
 How do we think about that?

1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:55.120
 And what do we do about that?

1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:57.200
 Do we continue one step at a time?

1:39:57.200 --> 1:40:04.840
 Yeah, we muddle through, I mean, we do our best, we realize that nobody's perfect and

1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:13.520
 we try to keep advancing, but we don't spend time saying we're not there, we're not all

1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:16.280
 the way to the end.

1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:21.400
 Some mathematicians that would be in the office next to me when I was in the math department,

1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:25.680
 they would never think about anything smaller than countable infinity.

1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:31.240
 And I never, you know, we intersect that countable infinity because I rarely got up to countable

1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:32.240
 infinity.

1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:34.120
 I was always talking about finance stuff.

1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:44.520
 But even limiting to finance stuff, which the universe might be, there's no way to really

1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:58.440
 know whether the universe isn't just made out of capital N, whatever units you want

1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:03.320
 to call them, quarks or whatever, where capital N is some finite number, all of the numbers

1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:08.680
 that are comprehensible are still way smaller than most, almost all finite numbers.

1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:17.480
 I got this one paper called Supernatural Numbers, where I guess you probably ran into something

1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:22.520
 called Knuth arrow notation, did you run into that, where anyway, so you take the number,

1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:31.120
 I think it's like, and I called it super K, I named it after myself, but arrow notation

1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:37.400
 is something like 10 and then four arrows and a three or something, okay, no, the arrow

1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:46.000
 notation, if you have no arrows, that means multiplication, x, y means x times x times

1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:51.120
 x times x y times, if you have one arrow, that means exponentiation, so x one arrow

1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:56.560
 y means x to the x to the x to the x to the x y times.

1:41:56.560 --> 1:42:11.080
 So I found out, by the way, that this notation was invented by a guy in 1830 and he was one

1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:16.760
 of the English nobility who spent his time thinking about stuff like this.

1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:22.400
 And it was exactly the same concept that I used arrows and he used a slightly different

1:42:22.400 --> 1:42:28.680
 notation, but anyway, and then this Ackerman's function is based on the same kind of ideas,

1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:37.080
 but Ackerman was 1920s, but anyway, we got this number 10 quadruple arrow three.

1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:45.880
 So that says, well, we take 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10, how many times

1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:53.120
 do we do that, oh, 10 double arrow two times or something, I mean, how tall is that stack?

1:42:53.120 --> 1:42:59.520
 But then we do that again, because that was only 10 quadruple arrow two, we take quadruple

1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:00.520
 arrow three.

1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:01.920
 It could be a pretty large number.

1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:12.640
 It gets way beyond comprehension, okay, and so, but it's so small compared to what finite

1:43:12.640 --> 1:43:19.000
 numbers really are, because I want to use four arrows and 10 and a three, I mean, let's

1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.480
 have that many number of arrows, I mean.

1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:30.160
 The boundary between infinite and finite is incomprehensible for us humans anyway.

1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:45.720
 Reality is a useful way for us to think about extremely large things, and we can manipulate

1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:51.920
 it, but we can never know that the universe is actually anywhere near that.

1:43:51.920 --> 1:44:11.160
 So I realize how little we know, but we found an awful lot of things that are too hard for

1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:14.280
 any one person to know, even in our small universe.

1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:16.600
 Yeah, and we did pretty good.

1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:25.360
 So when you go up to heaven and meet God and get to ask one question that would get answered,

1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:30.640
 what question would you ask?

1:44:30.640 --> 1:44:35.280
 What kind of browser do you have up here?

1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:45.480
 No, I actually, I don't think it's meaningful to ask this question, but I certainly hope

1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:47.600
 we had good internet.

1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:52.320
 Okay, on that note, that's beautiful, actually.

1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:55.360
 Don, thank you so much, it was a huge honor to talk to you.

1:44:55.360 --> 1:44:56.360
 I really appreciate it.

1:44:56.360 --> 1:44:58.800
 Okay, well, thanks for the gamut of questions.

1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:01.160
 Yeah, it was fun.

1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:40.560
 We should continually be striving to transform every art into a science, and in the process,

1:45:40.560 --> 1:45:43.760
 we advance the art.

1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:46.320
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
