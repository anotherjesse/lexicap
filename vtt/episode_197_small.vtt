 The following is a conversation with Jaco Willink, a retired U.S. Navy SEAL, coauthor of Extreme

00:06.080 --> 00:11.760
 Ownership, Diacotomy of Leadership, Discipline Equals Freedom, and many other excellent books.

00:11.760 --> 00:18.640
 And he's the host of Jaco Podcast. Jaco spent 20 years in the SEAL teams. He was the commander of

00:18.640 --> 00:24.960
 SEAL Team 3's task unit bruiser that became the most highly decorated special operations unit

00:24.960 --> 00:31.680
 of the Iraq War. This conversation was intense and to the point. We agreed to talk again,

00:31.680 --> 00:38.080
 probably many times, and what I find very interesting, aside from the talk of leadership,

00:38.080 --> 00:42.400
 is the conversation about military tactics of specific battles in history.

00:43.200 --> 00:49.920
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Linode Indeed, Simply Safe, and Ground News. Check them out

00:49.920 --> 00:55.200
 in the description to support this podcast. Since it's the 4th of July, a holiday in the

00:55.200 --> 01:01.680
 United States, let me say a few words about what this country, my country, the United States of

01:01.680 --> 01:07.760
 America means to me. First, by way of background, I was born and raised in the Soviet Union,

01:07.760 --> 01:12.560
 just long enough to get a bit of the Russian soul, an appreciation of Soviet history,

01:12.560 --> 01:18.800
 music, culture, of wrestling and mathematics, of engineering and philosophy, stoicism and

01:18.800 --> 01:26.640
 humor, tragedies and triumphs of war and revolutions, all in ways that are uniquely Russian. I do happen

01:26.640 --> 01:33.280
 to at times mention that I'm Russian. This is what I mean, that I got a bit of that Russian soul.

01:34.240 --> 01:39.920
 But of course, who I really am is an American. This country gave me the opportunity, the freedom

01:39.920 --> 01:46.480
 to become and to be who I am, to stand as an individual. This seemingly simple freedom to be

01:46.480 --> 01:51.680
 a sovereign human being in the face of all the beauty and cruelty of life is why I love this

01:51.680 --> 01:59.600
 country. Much of life can be unfair, unjust, even tragic. But this is the country where if I'm clever

01:59.600 --> 02:05.680
 enough, work hard enough, and just get lucky enough, I have a chance to dream big and make my dream a

02:05.680 --> 02:12.000
 reality. The United States welcomed me, my family, and millions of immigrants throughout its history

02:12.000 --> 02:17.200
 so that we can make something meaningful of ourselves, to love, to dream, to create, to find

02:17.200 --> 02:24.400
 joy and meaning. It lets me be the weird kid I am, who wears a suit, talks about love, and has a

02:24.400 --> 02:30.000
 fascination with robots. I know some people these days have an aversion to pride and love for their

02:30.000 --> 02:38.640
 country. I don't. I love America. I also love humanity. I believe these two, patriotism and

02:38.640 --> 02:43.920
 humanism, are not in conflict. Much like loving your family and loving your country are not in

02:43.920 --> 02:50.000
 conflict. They are all manifestations of the human spirit, longing to strive for a better world.

02:50.640 --> 02:57.280
 I was born a Russian, but I believe I will die an American, a proud American. Hopefully not too

02:57.280 --> 03:03.520
 soon, but life is short. I already had one hell of a fun journey, so I'm ready to go when it's time.

03:03.520 --> 03:09.520
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Jaco Willink.

03:10.640 --> 03:14.960
 Is it tragic or beautiful to you that some of the closest bonds that have formed

03:15.520 --> 03:23.120
 between people are through war often? I think it's both. Both tragic and beautiful, and

03:24.400 --> 03:25.520
 for the obvious reasons.

03:25.520 --> 03:32.080
 What are the obvious reasons? Why is it so obvious?

03:34.480 --> 03:40.720
 Well, it's tragic because a lot of people die, and it's beautiful because you form bonds with

03:40.720 --> 03:47.120
 people that are very difficult to break once you've been through them.

03:47.120 --> 03:54.560
 What is it about the trauma of war that makes bonds difficult to break?

03:55.840 --> 04:02.320
 Because what you realize when you're in war is that the people that are next to you,

04:03.840 --> 04:09.920
 you rely on them, and they're relying on you to survive. Without them, you will not survive.

04:09.920 --> 04:19.120
 And when you realize that you need to work together as a team to live, that forms a very

04:19.120 --> 04:24.800
 strong bond. And there's nothing like that team outside of the realm of war?

04:25.440 --> 04:30.400
 I don't know because there's a lot of things that I haven't experienced in my life,

04:30.400 --> 04:38.400
 but I think the pressure and the consequences of war, there could be similar situations in

04:38.400 --> 04:46.400
 survival scenarios, in various atrocities, where people need to work together in order to survive.

04:46.400 --> 04:51.200
 And I think you could probably get something that was similar.

04:51.200 --> 04:56.400
 There's a very particular nature to the kind of war that World War II was, especially for the

04:56.400 --> 05:02.400
 Soviet Union, where it didn't just influence the lives of people that created culture,

05:02.400 --> 05:11.200
 the music, the poetry, the literature. It's in the way people think, it's in the way people see

05:11.200 --> 05:20.400
 the world, it's in the way they talk, even still to this day. And of course, I was talking about

05:20.400 --> 05:26.800
 the directly relationship between two soldiers, but there's something about the depth of human

05:26.800 --> 05:34.800
 connection that results from the almost like reverberations of war, like generations later,

05:34.800 --> 05:41.200
 you're still close to other humans. There's a coldness towards other humans in Russia,

05:42.800 --> 05:52.800
 but once you open up, it's depth. You seek depth of connection versus like breath of career kind

05:52.800 --> 05:58.800
 of thinking, how can I make friends with this so I can move into this direction? What can this person benefit me?

05:58.800 --> 06:04.800
 Instead, you seek a depth of human connection and appreciation that brings a lot. And maybe I'm

06:04.800 --> 06:12.800
 romanticizing war here, but it feels like that's inextricably connected to World War II for Russians.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.800
 Does that resonate at all?

06:14.800 --> 06:22.800
 So, if you look at military training, what they do is they take people in the military from the

06:22.800 --> 06:26.800
 civilian world, they bring them into the military and they put them through boot camp,

06:26.800 --> 06:31.800
 which is the stereotypical thing that you see on TV, you're going to get yelled at, you're going to get

06:31.800 --> 06:37.800
 screamed at, you're going to get put in the mud and you're going to be made to do hard things together.

06:37.800 --> 06:46.800
 And what does that do with those civilians? Well, it gives them a common background. It gives them a common

06:46.800 --> 06:53.800
 suffering that they've been through together. And they form some sort of connection, some sort of bond.

06:53.800 --> 07:00.800
 Now, to make that bond a little bit stronger, after you get done with boot camp, they send you to advanced

07:00.800 --> 07:08.800
 infantry school. And you suffer some more together. And when you suffer more together, now you're in a smaller

07:08.800 --> 07:15.800
 group too, because now it's infantry, it's not supply people anymore or low justifications, it's strictly

07:15.800 --> 07:20.800
 people that are going to fight their infantrymen. So they go through a school together and now they get a little

07:20.800 --> 07:27.800
 bit tighter. Get done with that. And maybe you go to an airborne division. So you go to airborne school.

07:27.800 --> 07:33.800
 And now you all overcome this fear of jumping out of an airplane together and you celebrate surviving that.

07:33.800 --> 07:39.800
 Then maybe you get done with that. And now you go at an airborne division. Now you're an even tighter group

07:39.800 --> 07:45.800
 because you've suffered together. What comes next is special forces training or Ranger training. And what they do

07:45.800 --> 07:50.800
 is they put you in these situations where you're going to suffer together. And you're going to build these

07:50.800 --> 07:55.800
 bonds because as I said earlier, you have to rely on each other to survive. And by the way, not everyone

07:55.800 --> 07:59.800
 does, not everyone makes it through this training. So you sort of have these memories of people that didn't make it.

07:59.800 --> 08:07.800
 You share that connection as well. And you can keep going down this road until you go into combat with a military unit

08:07.800 --> 08:13.800
 and military units that go through combat have an even tighter bond. And the harder the combat that they go through

08:13.800 --> 08:20.800
 the tighter the bond is going to be. So I think when you talk about what the Soviet Union went through in World War

08:20.800 --> 08:33.800
 II, there was a shared suffering to survive. And so the entire nation has that common thread. And that's probably the

08:33.800 --> 08:43.800
 thing that you sense or feel when you refer back to the bond that resonates all the way back to World War II.

08:43.800 --> 08:51.800
 So in your podcast and your writing, you talk about some of the most fascinating things that I listened to you talk

08:51.800 --> 09:03.800
 about in terms of military conflict is tactics and sort of the details of combat. But allow me to stick on World

09:03.800 --> 09:13.800
 War II for a second. There's a particular aspect to that war. I don't know if you can speak to it, where twice the number

09:13.800 --> 09:26.800
 of civilians died in military personnel. So the Soviet Union especially. You know, my grandfather was a machine gunner

09:26.800 --> 09:36.800
 in Ukraine as the Germans were marching towards Moscow. There's this main, there's this important push in 1941

09:36.800 --> 09:43.800
 where they were trying to get before the winter to Moscow. And what Stalin was doing is he was basically throwing

09:43.800 --> 09:54.800
 bodies at just slow the attack. And what that meant is everybody understood that your job was, you have this heavy

09:54.800 --> 10:01.800
 machine guns. It's very, it's almost unreasonable to be able to be mobile and you kind of wait with them. So you're, you're

10:01.800 --> 10:09.800
 throwing at the front, and you just nonstop shooting. And, you know, 95 plus percent of people are just dead.

10:09.800 --> 10:16.800
 Other soldiers are just dead. And then you just go back and back and you're trying to protect as many civilians as you

10:16.800 --> 10:23.800
 can throughout this whole process, but you don't. And so you have millions of civilians that die along the way into this

10:23.800 --> 10:33.800
 march. Is there something you could say about this complete, perhaps it's naive of me to say, but a war that lacks tactics,

10:33.800 --> 10:52.800
 that lacks strategy, and is purely about just no consideration of human life and just throwing bodies and bullets

10:52.800 --> 11:04.800
 into a mix together where millions die. And that in particular felt much less like conflict and much more like torture

11:04.800 --> 11:15.800
 or suffering. It didn't, it didn't come off as torture, only that interestingly enough, as you probably know, my grandfather,

11:15.800 --> 11:24.800
 including everybody else volunteered. They were proud to do this. They were proud to march to their death for country,

11:24.800 --> 11:33.800
 for love of country. But the question on the civilian side, when, when more civilians die than military personnel,

11:33.800 --> 11:36.800
 what do you make of that?

11:36.800 --> 11:46.800
 It's awful. It's awful when a soldier dies. It's awful when a civilian dies. It's awful when 10 civilians or 10 soldiers,

11:46.800 --> 11:53.800
 and it's even more awful when millions and millions of soldiers and civilians die.

11:53.800 --> 12:02.800
 I think it's safe to say that the Soviet Union was facing an existential threat to their existence against the Nazis.

12:02.800 --> 12:12.800
 So to not fight would be to die as well, maybe die a death a few years later, maybe die a different way,

12:12.800 --> 12:25.800
 but the choice was die now, trying, or die later on your knees. And I think the choice was pretty clear.

12:25.800 --> 12:34.800
 As far as the tactics go, I mean, there is, this is attrition warfare. That's what that is. We are going to keep,

12:34.800 --> 12:41.800
 you know, you said throwing bodies at the problem. That's attrition warfare. And the Soviet Union had a lot of bodies,

12:41.800 --> 12:48.800
 more than the Germans. And when you fight with attrition warfare, whoever has more men and material will eventually win.

12:48.800 --> 12:58.800
 It's an awful way. But that's what the strategy was.

12:58.800 --> 13:06.800
 You often talk about leadership. Let's put the evils of Hitler aside.

13:06.800 --> 13:22.800
 The boldness of Hitler in making some of the strategic decisions he did was considered by many military historians quite brilliant early in the war or insane and brilliant.

13:22.800 --> 13:30.800
 Stalin, on the other hand, I think university is seen as somebody who is terrible military strategist, especially early in the war.

13:30.800 --> 13:38.800
 He did not see all the possible trajectories that the war could take. Is there something you could say about failure of leadership?

13:38.800 --> 13:55.800
 Stalin, also the United Kingdom before Churchill, and also FDR on the United States side, who basically was trying to turn a blind eye to everything that was happening over there.

13:55.800 --> 14:07.800
 With a perspective of we just want to make, we want to keep America's interest as the primary interest and everything else, let other countries work out their problems.

14:07.800 --> 14:13.800
 You know, I think one of the things with Hitler was in the beginning of the war, he listened to his advisors, he listened to his generals.

14:13.800 --> 14:29.800
 And therefore they did pretty well with that. I think as the war went on, he believed that he was smarter than he was and made decisions that were bad, that cost him dearly.

14:29.800 --> 14:37.800
 You know, I mean, case in point, as everyone knows, going and attacking the Soviet Union while you're still fighting a war on the other front is not a good move.

14:37.800 --> 14:45.800
 There's an example of, yeah, bad leadership, letting your ego get in the way, believing that you can do things that are beyond your capabilities.

14:45.800 --> 14:55.800
 But, you know, as you mentioned in the beginning with Blitzkrieg, those were really dynamic and bold moves, and they worked.

14:55.800 --> 15:02.800
 And what does that do? That fuels your ego and makes you think that you can win.

15:02.800 --> 15:10.800
 Many people consider that war a just war. What do you think makes a just war?

15:10.800 --> 15:19.800
 I think you have the Nazis and the Imperial Japanese trying to impose their will on other nations and other peoples.

15:19.800 --> 15:30.800
 And when that happens, I think on a grand scale, people look at that and believe it's just to step in and do something about it.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.800
 Is there some gray area here?

15:33.800 --> 15:37.800
 There's nothing but gray area.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.800
 The United States has been involved in a lot of military conflicts since then.

15:41.800 --> 15:48.800
 How do you draw the line through the gray area? What war should we engage in and not?

15:48.800 --> 15:54.800
 I know you don't get into politics much, but the decision to go to war.

15:54.800 --> 16:02.800
 You have to look at the situation that you're going into and you have to make sure that you have the will to go to war.

16:02.800 --> 16:08.800
 And the will to go to war means that you are willing to kill people.

16:08.800 --> 16:15.800
 And when I say people, I don't just mean enemy because in war, civilians are going to die, women and children are going to die.

16:15.800 --> 16:20.800
 A lot of people are going to die, and so you are going to kill them.

16:20.800 --> 16:25.800
 It doesn't matter what kind of smart munitions you have, it doesn't matter how disciplined your soldiers are.

16:25.800 --> 16:31.800
 When you go into a war, civilians are going to die and you have to understand that.

16:31.800 --> 16:40.800
 And the other thing that you have to understand is that your troops are also going to die.

16:40.800 --> 16:46.800
 And it seems like sometimes we're a little bit naive about the calculation of what that's going to look like.

16:46.800 --> 16:52.800
 And maybe we think, well, not that many civilians and maybe not that many of our personnel are going to die.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.800
 And that's where you get into sticky situations.

16:55.800 --> 17:04.800
 And another thing when you were talking about the Soviet Union versus the Nazis, that's total war.

17:04.800 --> 17:05.800
 That's what that is.

17:05.800 --> 17:06.800
 And we don't engage in that very often.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.800
 It's total war.

17:07.800 --> 17:11.800
 It's we will do absolutely anything to win.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.800
 And America doesn't fight like that very often.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.800
 In fact, the last time we fought like that was World War II.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.800
 It was total war.

17:20.800 --> 17:27.800
 We will do whatever it takes to up to and including the atomic bomb to destroy the enemy.

17:27.800 --> 17:32.800
 So those are the kind of things you need to think about before you go to war.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.800
 And I don't think we think about that very often.

17:35.800 --> 17:48.800
 You know, even the United States, the atomic bomb, nuclear weapons is an interesting one because there's a lot of there's a lot of hesitation on that.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.800
 There's a lot of critics of that decision as it was happening.

17:52.800 --> 18:00.800
 So even America, you can imagine other countries like Germany would not be so hesitant to use nuclear weapons.

18:00.800 --> 18:12.800
 It's interesting to think about in deciding military strategy to inject ethics into it, into morality.

18:12.800 --> 18:20.800
 It's not just about winning the war, but should we do this and doing the calculation of human life?

18:20.800 --> 18:32.800
 Usually those decisions are made by leaders, not by the soldier that's going to be implementing that decision.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.800
 Do you put some responsibility?

18:34.800 --> 18:40.800
 I should even say blame on the leaders and not doing that kind of calculation here.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.800
 You could say that you could say about the Vietnam War.

18:43.800 --> 18:47.800
 You could say that about even the war that you were involved with in Iraq.

18:47.800 --> 18:56.800
 Is there some criticism here that you could apply to leaders for failing not to consider the broader moral questions?

18:56.800 --> 19:00.800
 Yes.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.800
 Natural?

19:02.800 --> 19:10.800
 Like all leaders will make these mistakes or should leaders not make these mistakes?

19:10.800 --> 19:12.800
 Leaders are going to make mistakes.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.800
 It's impossible to know what's going to happen in war just like it's impossible to know what's going to happen in life.

19:16.800 --> 19:24.800
 You make decisions based on the information that you have at the time and you will make mistakes.

19:24.800 --> 19:34.800
 If you fail to admit that you made a mistake, that's where I have a more significant problem than someone that makes a mistake and says,

19:34.800 --> 19:36.800
 hey, this is the mistake that I made.

19:36.800 --> 19:43.800
 This is the intelligence that I thought we were utilizing and it actually is not what I thought it was going to be.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.800
 And here's the new direction that we're going in.

19:46.800 --> 19:56.800
 We don't have enough of that type of ownership in leadership globally.

19:56.800 --> 20:06.800
 Just saying I made a mistake that resulted in a loss at scale of human life, being able to say that.

20:06.800 --> 20:13.800
 And when you don't say that, you end up with a more loss of human life.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.800
 Can I ask you about the loss of human life?

20:17.800 --> 20:23.800
 How does killing a human being change you?

20:23.800 --> 20:25.800
 What does it mean to kill a human being?

20:25.800 --> 20:32.800
 What does it feel like to kill a human being?

20:32.800 --> 20:37.800
 Well, I guess you'd have to look at what circumstances a person is in when this is taking place.

20:37.800 --> 20:46.800
 If you've got someone that's in a fit of rage that goes and kills somebody, they're going to come out of it and think,

20:46.800 --> 20:49.800
 wow, I've just really messed up.

20:49.800 --> 21:01.800
 If you've got someone that is a sociopath, they're not going to feel anything and that person deserved to die and that's why they died.

21:01.800 --> 21:11.800
 If you've got a soldier who feels like they're trying to protect their friends, they'll move through that.

21:11.800 --> 21:21.800
 If you've got a soldier that's doing it because they want some kind of personal glory, they'll probably not feel good about it later.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.800
 So I think it depends on the situation.

21:23.800 --> 21:28.800
 I think it depends on the psychology of the individual that's going through it.

21:28.800 --> 21:33.800
 You said move through that.

21:33.800 --> 21:45.800
 Is there some calculation here that a soldier, when they kill another soldier, a realization that is just another human being?

21:45.800 --> 21:51.800
 I mean, is there some heavy burden to that aspect?

21:51.800 --> 21:56.800
 That it's ultimately just human on human.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.800
 I think it depends a lot on the scenario.

21:58.800 --> 22:10.800
 I know that when I was in Iraq fighting, we talk a lot about the dehumanization of the enemy and it's something that the governments will do.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.800
 Governments will do that to each other.

22:13.800 --> 22:23.800
 The Japanese dehumanized the Americans and the Americans dehumanized the Japanese and the Americans dehumanized the Nazis and the Nazis dehumanized the Americans

22:23.800 --> 22:31.800
 so that to remove as much of that human on human killing aspect that you're talking about.

22:31.800 --> 22:44.800
 And what I've said is that when we were in Iraq, we didn't have to dehumanize the enemy because the enemy dehumanized themselves through their actions, through their behaviors.

22:44.800 --> 22:55.800
 When we know that they are torturing and raping and murdering the local populace, they've been dehumanized.

22:55.800 --> 23:11.800
 And so as far as looking at them and thinking, oh, this is another human that's on the level of my uncle or my brother, I didn't think of them that way.

23:11.800 --> 23:25.800
 I thought of them as murdering, raping, evil subhumans.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.800
 Yeah, Iraq is different and America's position is different.

23:28.800 --> 23:39.800
 You're right that America has not been involved in a war where it's quite like two humans fighting like teenage boys fighting against each other.

23:39.800 --> 23:50.800
 And you've got to remember, I mean, we're seeing these Iraqi kids that are living under this sadistic terror.

23:50.800 --> 23:57.800
 The Iraqi women that are being raped and abused by these insurgents.

23:57.800 --> 24:12.800
 And so on the one side, we become the Iraqi populace is very humanized to us because we're talking to them, we've got interpreters, we understand, we're seeing them day after day, the same individuals.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.800
 And so we form a bond with the local populace.

24:16.800 --> 24:20.800
 And yet we see what the insurgents are doing.

24:20.800 --> 24:27.800
 And so it's, again, not difficult to dehumanize people that behave in that manner.

24:27.800 --> 24:36.800
 Yeah, I suppose I worry about the dehumanization at a much larger scale when it's not the kind of case that you're talking about.

24:36.800 --> 24:51.800
 Even now, hopefully I'm not fear mongering, but there's a sense in which there's the drums of war slowly starting to build with China.

24:51.800 --> 25:07.800
 In the best case, it would be a Cold War of there's a dehumanization aspect that's happening with China currently, which is they're the other and they're after stealing all of your data.

25:07.800 --> 25:24.800
 There's a cybersecurity, it starts with cybersecurity and it worries me because it creates the other out of a very large population that may ultimately lead to conflict.

25:24.800 --> 25:46.800
 In the worst case, hot conflict that would no longer be the situation you are in in Iraq and more similar to the Soviet Union conflict with Germany, that it's kids and then they're dehumanized to where you're at scale slaughtering them,

25:46.800 --> 25:54.800
 or at least hurting their quality of life in a way that's maybe suffering has many forms.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.800
 It doesn't have to be through just a hot war.

25:56.800 --> 26:02.800
 It could be through starvation, through camps, all those kinds of things.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.800
 And I worry about that.

26:04.800 --> 26:11.800
 We kind of tend to think that these wars are behind us and I'm not always so sure that's the case.

26:11.800 --> 26:16.800
 And at least in the way that it ultimately starts with hate.

26:16.800 --> 26:29.800
 And again, hopefully I'm not being too dramatic, but I see that there's a kind of brewing of it starts with dehumanization that turns the hate of the other.

26:29.800 --> 26:33.800
 You see that with China, you see it a little bit with Russia.

26:33.800 --> 26:41.800
 And you have an early podcast between where you break down the tactics of the Chechen war versus Russia.

26:41.800 --> 26:42.800
 It's fascinating.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.800
 But that's the kind of conflicts I'm referring to.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.800
 And I don't know.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.800
 There's a, I know you're a bit of a musician.

26:53.800 --> 26:57.800
 I love, I love that straight song called Brothers in Arms.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.800
 I don't know if you know that one.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.800
 And there's a line in it.

27:01.800 --> 27:06.800
 I think they play it quite often in military funerals, which I just recently learned.

27:06.800 --> 27:13.800
 But it's this powerful song that has a line where fools to make war on our brothers in arms.

27:13.800 --> 27:30.800
 Do you think there's some sense in which at the leadership level, but just as human beings, where perhaps foolish and engaging in military conflict as much as we have?

27:30.800 --> 27:36.800
 Or is fool a very inappropriate word here?

27:36.800 --> 27:42.800
 Well, I think that using the term brothers in arms means the people that are on my side, right?

27:42.800 --> 27:48.800
 So it doesn't make sense to start wars with people that are on your side.

27:48.800 --> 27:54.800
 So that's, that might just be the way the lyrics are written so that it fit the song or whatever.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.800
 I think broadly what you're asking me is, is war foolish.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.800
 Yeah.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.800
 And I would say the answer is yes.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.800
 And if you can avoid it, you absolutely should.

28:05.800 --> 28:19.800
 But if there is a bear or a wolf that is trying to get into your house, is it foolish to shoot that bear or shoot that wolf?

28:19.800 --> 28:21.800
 I think the answer is pretty obvious.

28:21.800 --> 28:33.800
 So when you're, you're threatened or your family are threatened or your way of life is threatened, then you have to do something to try and defend your family, your way of life.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.800
 It should be the last resort.

28:35.800 --> 28:38.800
 It should be the last resort.

28:38.800 --> 28:58.800
 You had a conversation with Jordan Peterson where he asked you a question in terms of war being last resort, whether you would like your kids to grow up in peace in a time of no war.

28:58.800 --> 29:04.800
 You said yes, but and so happens Jordan didn't let you finish.

29:04.800 --> 29:09.800
 Can you, can you elaborate what follows the butt?

29:09.800 --> 29:18.800
 Well, you, you and I have been talking about the fact that struggle brings people together and, and brings out the best and, and the worst brings out the worst in people.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.800
 War brings out the worst in people.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.800
 It also brings out the best in people.

29:23.800 --> 29:40.800
 So would you want your kid to go and enter in a wrestling tournament where you paid all the other kids off and your kid won?

29:40.800 --> 29:49.800
 Or you enter them in a jiu jitsu tournament where they're a purple belt and you know that everyone that they're going to fight against is a white belt.

29:49.800 --> 29:57.800
 And so they get the, they get the big W, they get the win, but they don't really get tested and they don't really struggle.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.800
 And if you don't struggle, you don't grow.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.800
 So that's the butt, right?

30:02.800 --> 30:16.800
 The, the absolute best times of my life were in combat and the worst times of my life were in combat.

30:16.800 --> 30:38.800
 And so even though I wouldn't want any of my children to suffer through the worst of times, at the same time, the butt is, I would want them to have the opportunity to feel that bond that you're referring to earlier and to see human beings that are willing to sacrifice their lives for their friends.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.800
 You mentioned the worst.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.800
 What are some of the worst aspects of when you were in Iraq?

30:45.800 --> 30:54.800
 What are the things that the hardest on you?

30:54.800 --> 30:57.800
 Have my guys killed.

30:57.800 --> 31:02.800
 Is there a absurd cruelty to it?

31:02.800 --> 31:09.800
 Was it due to mistakes or natural consequences of fighting?

31:09.800 --> 31:11.800
 Is there any difference?

31:11.800 --> 31:16.800
 Is that at the end is just losing those brothers and arms?

31:16.800 --> 31:24.800
 There's a million different ways to get killed in the war and you can go out in an operation and you can do everything wrong and you can survive.

31:24.800 --> 31:29.800
 And you can go out in an operation and do everything perfect and you can get killed.

31:29.800 --> 31:34.800
 Is there some aspect which makes it worse when there is mistakes made?

31:34.800 --> 31:42.800
 Well, yeah, if there's mistakes made, then you're going to sit there and beat yourself up eternally for mistakes that were made.

31:42.800 --> 31:49.800
 But to you, the things that hurt is just losing, losing people close to you.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.800
 Yes.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.800
 Are you yourself afraid of death?

31:54.800 --> 31:57.800
 No.

31:57.800 --> 32:03.800
 Do you think about it? Does it make sense to you that this thing ends?

32:03.800 --> 32:08.800
 Like, the Stoics contemplated death, it gives flavor to life.

32:08.800 --> 32:13.800
 It makes you appreciate there's something about the finiteness of life that makes it...

32:13.800 --> 32:22.800
 It makes this jocodiscipline go drink sour apple that I'm enjoying is delicious.

32:22.800 --> 32:26.800
 It makes it taste better because I'm going to die one day.

32:26.800 --> 32:32.800
 And I think about that a lot. Do you think about it?

32:32.800 --> 32:36.800
 Other than I know that it's going to end.

32:36.800 --> 32:39.800
 But I don't think about it on a daily basis.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.800
 It's just a fact.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.800
 I know that I'm lucky to be here.

32:43.800 --> 32:51.800
 I know that many people sacrificed to give me this opportunity to be here.

32:51.800 --> 32:56.800
 But I don't dwell on it.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.800
 What about when you were in combat? Nothing.

32:59.800 --> 33:03.800
 There's tactics, there's strategy, there's the mission,

33:03.800 --> 33:09.800
 and then your mortality is not part of the calculation.

33:09.800 --> 33:14.800
 I think you get to a point where you accept the fact that you can die.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.800
 Like I said, you can do everything right.

33:17.800 --> 33:22.800
 You roll out the gate, you hit an IED, a triple stack, subsurface IED, and you're done.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.800
 And there's nothing that's going to stop that. It's going to happen.

33:25.800 --> 33:29.800
 And I think if you're scared of that or you're thinking about that,

33:29.800 --> 33:32.800
 it's going to inhibit your ability to do your job properly.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.800
 And I think it's also going to drive you crazy.

33:35.800 --> 33:40.800
 The thing that I thought about more was that happening to my guys.

33:40.800 --> 33:48.800
 And that's the gut wrenching terror that you feel when operations happen.

33:48.800 --> 33:55.800
 Can I ask you about Love of Country? It continues to...

33:55.800 --> 34:00.800
 Just how much I've studied Stalin recently in the past few years.

34:00.800 --> 34:04.800
 It continues to surprise me. Not surprise me.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.800
 It's just tragic in some kind of way.

34:07.800 --> 34:12.800
 I'm not sure exactly if I could put words to it, but how many people still do.

34:12.800 --> 34:21.800
 At the time, we're willing, loved Stalin, and we're willing to die for country, for the love of country.

34:21.800 --> 34:30.800
 And I, too, maybe because I was born there and now I am a red blooded American.

34:30.800 --> 34:37.800
 I love... Nationalism is a bad word, but I love the love of country.

34:37.800 --> 34:45.800
 It somehow gives meaning, like a brotherhood, like we're in this together.

34:45.800 --> 34:49.800
 I love... That's why I love the Olympics.

34:49.800 --> 34:53.800
 That's just the unity of it.

34:53.800 --> 34:59.800
 It takes a step out of the selfish pursuits of anyone, particular aunt,

34:59.800 --> 35:02.800
 and looks at us as a big aunt colony.

35:02.800 --> 35:06.800
 And it's inspiring. It's exciting.

35:06.800 --> 35:12.800
 But at the same time, it seems to get us to do horrible things

35:12.800 --> 35:17.800
 if manipulated by charismatic leaders.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.800
 What do you make of this love of country?

35:19.800 --> 35:23.800
 Is it a bad thing? Is it a thing that gets in the way?

35:23.800 --> 35:25.800
 Or is it a good thing?

35:25.800 --> 35:31.800
 Well, I think like anything else, if it's balanced correctly, it's great.

35:31.800 --> 35:35.800
 And if it goes to some extreme level, then it becomes a negative.

35:35.800 --> 35:42.800
 I think it's probably sourced in some sort of animalistic tribalism

35:42.800 --> 35:44.800
 that we all have to be part of a tribe.

35:44.800 --> 35:48.800
 And this is a real big tribe that you get to be a part of.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.800
 And all you have to do is kind of show up.

35:50.800 --> 35:57.800
 And so when someone says, hey, we're going to play hockey against the Russians,

35:57.800 --> 36:01.800
 well, we're going to cheer for the American boys.

36:01.800 --> 36:05.800
 So my area of work is artificial intelligence.

36:05.800 --> 36:11.800
 It'd be interesting to ask your thoughts about something, which is autonomous weapons systems.

36:11.800 --> 36:20.800
 US has now officially released a report saying that they're engaging

36:20.800 --> 36:26.800
 in adding more and more autonomy and artificial intelligence into its weapons systems

36:26.800 --> 36:28.800
 because China is doing it.

36:28.800 --> 36:33.800
 And so these are the first steps in something that AI folks worry about,

36:33.800 --> 36:44.800
 which is a race, an AI race in the space of autonomous weapons that can run away too quickly.

36:44.800 --> 36:49.800
 Is that something, I don't know if in general, if you have thoughts about

36:49.800 --> 36:57.800
 weapon systems that make autonomous decisions at the small scale of just targeting where to shoot

36:57.800 --> 37:02.800
 and at the largest scale of military strategy of just being given a mission

37:02.800 --> 37:09.800
 of destroy this particular target, this particular, say, terrorist human being

37:09.800 --> 37:13.800
 and then figure out what is the right bombing campaign on your own

37:13.800 --> 37:17.800
 to accomplish this task that minimizes civilian death.

37:17.800 --> 37:23.800
 And then just loading that in and letting the AI system automatically decide that.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.800
 What are your general thoughts about it?

37:26.800 --> 37:28.800
 Do you worry about it?

37:28.800 --> 37:33.800
 Because as the positive effects that in the best version of that world,

37:33.800 --> 37:42.800
 you kill fewer civilians, you kill her fewer of your own human beings,

37:42.800 --> 37:50.800
 but at the negative side of that, you might lose the thing we kind of talked about,

37:50.800 --> 37:56.800
 the basic humanity even in the individual soldier of what is right and what is wrong

37:56.800 --> 38:03.800
 and not making huge mistakes that hurt thousands or millions of people.

38:03.800 --> 38:06.800
 I guess what you're asking me is if they could make a machine

38:06.800 --> 38:12.800
 that could do more surgical attacks on enemy individuals.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.800
 Would I be for it?

38:14.800 --> 38:16.800
 Yes, I would be for it.

38:16.800 --> 38:22.800
 The problem is if you've ever used machines of any kind,

38:22.800 --> 38:28.800
 their initial design may not be, there's unintended consequences.

38:28.800 --> 38:38.800
 There's ways in the machine actually behaves that you realize there's bugs in this thing.

38:38.800 --> 38:42.800
 So do we not put protocols in place to prevent something from going too far

38:42.800 --> 38:45.800
 outside the boundaries of what we wanted to execute?

38:45.800 --> 38:50.800
 You do, but the question is this is the first time in human history

38:50.800 --> 38:58.800
 you can create things, machines, toaster, microwave oven that's smarter than you

38:58.800 --> 39:00.800
 in this particular task.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.800
 I mean, it's not yet there.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.800
 You're learning a lot with military strategies.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.800
 Humans are actually really damn smart.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.800
 It's very hard to improve on a human.

39:11.800 --> 39:15.800
 So most actual drones that are unmanned are still piloted by humans.

39:15.800 --> 39:20.800
 It's very difficult to do every aspect of war.

39:20.800 --> 39:26.800
 But it's not out of the realm of possibility that machines will start doing those things better

39:26.800 --> 39:35.800
 and certain things, certain more precise targeting of the enemy.

39:35.800 --> 39:42.800
 The question is, so what happens when you start to rely on the machine to do some of the task

39:42.800 --> 39:45.800
 is you get lazy.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.800
 You forget what it is like to do that task.

39:48.800 --> 39:53.800
 More importantly, you lose the knowledge of the intricacies of that task

39:53.800 --> 39:56.800
 and you forget the ways it can go wrong.

39:56.800 --> 40:04.800
 So the protocols may not be sufficient to constrain the power of the ways that things go wrong.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.800
 Especially when things are moving really quickly,

40:07.800 --> 40:13.800
 especially when the ethics of the two sides aren't perfectly aligned.

40:13.800 --> 40:17.800
 When people are some certain sides, like on the Chinese side,

40:17.800 --> 40:24.800
 may be more willing to take risks for dangerous consequences than others.

40:24.800 --> 40:28.800
 So what happened on the bioweapon side is internationally,

40:28.800 --> 40:32.800
 maybe you can speak to this more, but my sense, what I was told,

40:32.800 --> 40:37.800
 there's a sense globally that bioweapons are not going to be used.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.800
 They're unethical.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.800
 There's a sense like we're not going to engage in this.

40:42.800 --> 40:50.800
 And with AI currently, China and US said green light.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.800
 I'll go ahead.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.800
 It's totally ethical.

40:53.800 --> 40:59.800
 If it can decrease the loss of human life, why not?

40:59.800 --> 41:10.800
 My worry is that it's much easier to design weapons that are effective

41:10.800 --> 41:18.800
 than design weapons who have the depth of ethics and morals that humans do.

41:18.800 --> 41:22.800
 Which I think we don't, as human beings, don't acknowledge enough

41:22.800 --> 41:30.800
 that even the cold calculated killing of others, precise, effective execution of a mission,

41:30.800 --> 41:34.800
 still has ethics in it at every level.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.800
 You know what's right and what's wrong.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.800
 I don't know if you take that away.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.800
 You're not going to make huge mistakes that you regret.

41:42.800 --> 41:48.800
 Is that something you don't worry about?

41:48.800 --> 41:54.800
 I don't really worry about it, but as you design something, like I said,

41:54.800 --> 42:00.800
 you put protocols in place and from what I am hearing you say or trying to hear you say,

42:00.800 --> 42:07.800
 there's be a point where our protocols wouldn't be sufficient to stop the machine

42:07.800 --> 42:14.800
 from doing something that was unethical.

42:14.800 --> 42:18.800
 I'm kind of worried that this is something you don't worry about

42:18.800 --> 42:24.800
 because a lot of people I respect don't worry about it and I don't know what to do about that.

42:24.800 --> 42:26.800
 A lot of generals don't worry about it.

42:26.800 --> 42:34.800
 A lot of people who know much more about war like you than me don't worry about it and that worries me.

42:34.800 --> 42:41.800
 Well, that's because you have a vision into the shortfalls of AI and I don't.

42:41.800 --> 42:44.800
 I don't have a vision of the shortfalls of AI.

42:44.800 --> 42:45.800
 I don't know enough about it.

42:45.800 --> 42:49.800
 As far as I'm concerned, you put an on off switch somewhere.

42:49.800 --> 42:57.800
 You put a kill switch on a system and if it starts going awry, you hit the kill switch and that's it.

42:57.800 --> 43:02.800
 So when you look at me and say, well, there's no possible way to put a kill switch,

43:02.800 --> 43:06.800
 that would be 100% effective and you draw out those concerns to me

43:06.800 --> 43:11.800
 and we could talk through it and say, okay, well, here's where we should draw the line.

43:11.800 --> 43:16.800
 I mean, it's like, again, from the Soviet Union Chernobyl meltdown,

43:16.800 --> 43:20.800
 there's always the ability, I believe, to have a kill switch.

43:20.800 --> 43:25.800
 The problem is the more power you give to the machine,

43:25.800 --> 43:34.800
 the more opportunity you give to the human supervising that machine to make a mistake

43:34.800 --> 43:37.800
 and not shut off the switch at the right time.

43:37.800 --> 43:42.800
 So yes, the solution, I mean, you're putting the responsibility still in the human hands

43:42.800 --> 43:44.800
 and I think that's the correct place to put it.

43:44.800 --> 43:49.800
 There should be good protocols, good leadership, good execution, competency all around.

43:49.800 --> 43:53.800
 Your protocols should consider the basic failures of human nature,

43:53.800 --> 43:55.800
 the human factor of how things go wrong,

43:55.800 --> 43:59.800
 so there should be multiple people supervising the system, all those things.

43:59.800 --> 44:05.800
 But I am just very skeptical of greater and greater power in the machine

44:05.800 --> 44:09.800
 that can create war, that cannot lead to death.

44:09.800 --> 44:13.800
 Yeah, and that's why, like I said, and like you just said,

44:13.800 --> 44:16.800
 you have protocols in place that are a kill switch

44:16.800 --> 44:20.800
 and if you think about the amount of nuclear weapons that we've had on planet Earth

44:20.800 --> 44:23.800
 for the past however many years,

44:23.800 --> 44:30.800
 and there's been no rogue element that said, you know what, I'm going to shoot this thing.

44:30.800 --> 44:36.800
 There's been no protocol that took place where all of a sudden we said, oh no.

44:36.800 --> 44:42.800
 I mean, there's been escalations, but the protocols worked, have worked so far.

44:42.800 --> 44:45.800
 Now, that's a scary thing to think about,

44:45.800 --> 44:50.800
 that we rely on these protocols to stop some rogue element out there

44:50.800 --> 44:57.800
 from launching a missile that could kill millions of people and trigger a global war.

44:57.800 --> 45:01.800
 So yeah, the protocol should be strict.

45:01.800 --> 45:02.800
 Okay.

45:02.800 --> 45:06.800
 Can I ask a Jaco Wonka ridiculous question?

45:06.800 --> 45:10.800
 If human civilization goes extinct, what would be the reason?

45:10.800 --> 45:12.800
 You mentioned nuclear war.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.800
 Do you worry about this?

45:14.800 --> 45:18.800
 The reason I bring that up, a lot of people in the AI community

45:18.800 --> 45:20.800
 worry about artificial general intelligence.

45:20.800 --> 45:24.800
 So super intelligent AI systems creating a lot of damage.

45:24.800 --> 45:27.800
 Autonomous weapons systems is one possibility.

45:27.800 --> 45:30.800
 A lot of folks recently, especially with this pandemic,

45:30.800 --> 45:36.800
 if you want to be terrified, listen to somebody I talked to recently, Sam Harris.

45:36.800 --> 45:44.800
 He did a four hour podcast on how bioengineering of viruses is likely to destroy human civilization.

45:44.800 --> 45:50.800
 I recommend that highly if you were too optimistic about the future of the human species.

45:50.800 --> 45:53.800
 So apparently, in the space of bioengineering,

45:53.800 --> 46:03.800
 it's becoming easier and easier and easier to engineer viruses, engineer pathogens.

46:03.800 --> 46:07.800
 This is the world's most depressing question.

46:07.800 --> 46:16.800
 Is there something in particular you worry about that we should be thinking as a human species about?

46:16.800 --> 46:22.800
 Yeah, I'm sorry to disappoint you again with my lack of worry for all these problems,

46:22.800 --> 46:28.800
 but I don't worry too much about it.

46:28.800 --> 46:32.800
 We've made it through a bunch of wickets so far as a species,

46:32.800 --> 46:36.800
 and we'll make it through some more, or we won't.

46:36.800 --> 46:41.800
 And if we don't make it through some of these wickets and someone decides that what they're going to do over the weekend

46:41.800 --> 46:46.800
 is create some crazy virus that spreads and kills everybody.

46:46.800 --> 46:47.800
 Yeah.

46:47.800 --> 46:48.800
 You know what?

46:48.800 --> 46:51.800
 I'm usually extremely optimistic about this stuff.

46:51.800 --> 46:56.800
 I am now, I'm with you, except we won't.

46:56.800 --> 47:02.800
 Well, there's always a chance we won't, but I have a sense that human, first of all,

47:02.800 --> 47:06.800
 I believe that most people have much more capacity for good than evil.

47:06.800 --> 47:14.800
 All of us are capable of evil, I believe, but most people are much more capable of doing good and want to do good.

47:14.800 --> 47:20.800
 And I also believe in the resiliency of the human species that we're an innovative bunch,

47:20.800 --> 47:26.800
 and we can respond to tragedy, especially we respond more to tragedy as the scale of tragedy grows,

47:26.800 --> 47:29.800
 and our response is much better.

47:29.800 --> 47:33.800
 So that's why I'm not worried about it, bro.

47:33.800 --> 47:38.800
 What makes a great man?

47:38.800 --> 47:40.800
 Let's start at the individual.

47:40.800 --> 47:41.800
 What makes a great man?

47:41.800 --> 47:42.800
 What makes a great woman?

47:42.800 --> 47:45.800
 What makes a great human being?

47:45.800 --> 47:49.800
 Somebody that puts others above themselves.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.800
 What makes a great leader of humans?

47:52.800 --> 47:53.800
 Same thing.

47:53.800 --> 47:56.800
 But that sentence does a lot of work.

47:56.800 --> 48:00.800
 When you're a leader, there's a lot of egos.

48:00.800 --> 48:01.800
 There's a lot of tension.

48:01.800 --> 48:04.800
 There's the human factor.

48:04.800 --> 48:05.800
 There's people who are timid.

48:05.800 --> 48:08.800
 There's people who are assholes.

48:08.800 --> 48:13.800
 There's people who are incredibly competent, but self obsessed.

48:13.800 --> 48:14.800
 I don't know.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.800
 There's complexities of human nature.

48:16.800 --> 48:25.800
 How do you get all those people to be the best version of themselves and to lift up everyone else around them?

48:25.800 --> 48:28.800
 Okay, so now that question is a little bit different now.

48:28.800 --> 48:32.800
 So now it's getting into a more specific question, but at the same time,

48:32.800 --> 48:36.800
 a more broad question of what elements does it take to make a good leader?

48:36.800 --> 48:37.800
 Yes.

48:37.800 --> 48:40.800
 So you're right, that different people have different personalities,

48:40.800 --> 48:44.800
 different tendencies, different levels of ego.

48:44.800 --> 48:51.800
 And the way that I try and explain this is like a video game,

48:51.800 --> 48:59.800
 and I'm not even a video game player, but I've seen this before where video game characters have various skills,

48:59.800 --> 49:00.800
 various strengths and weaknesses.

49:00.800 --> 49:05.800
 So maybe they're strong, but they're dumb, or maybe they're strong and smart, but they're slow.

49:05.800 --> 49:07.800
 They just give them these ratings.

49:07.800 --> 49:09.800
 And so that's where human beings are.

49:09.800 --> 49:10.800
 And that's the way leaders are.

49:10.800 --> 49:15.800
 And you can have different leaders with different characteristics.

49:15.800 --> 49:20.800
 And depending on how all those characteristics match up,

49:20.800 --> 49:27.800
 you can have somebody that is very introverted, but they're still a very good leader,

49:27.800 --> 49:32.800
 because when they do communicate, they do it in a clear, simple manner that everyone understands.

49:32.800 --> 49:36.800
 So even though they're a little bit introverted, people still respect them and listen to them

49:36.800 --> 49:39.800
 because they communicate in a clear way.

49:39.800 --> 49:44.800
 You could have somebody that's extremely charismatic,

49:44.800 --> 49:50.800
 and everyone looks to them, but they're slow in making decisions.

49:50.800 --> 49:56.800
 And so now we've got someone that can't really make decisions when decisions need to get made.

49:56.800 --> 49:59.800
 So even though they're charismatic, they're still not a good leader.

49:59.800 --> 50:03.800
 So depending on the human being that we're talking about,

50:03.800 --> 50:07.800
 and you just mentioned earlier that human beings are more complex than anything

50:07.800 --> 50:11.800
 and do a better job at just about everything than a robot,

50:11.800 --> 50:13.800
 so that's the same thing with leadership.

50:13.800 --> 50:16.800
 You have all these different characteristics and you match them or mix them together.

50:16.800 --> 50:24.800
 And depending on where the ratings come out, depending on how that thing does in the end.

50:24.800 --> 50:30.800
 Can we almost like as a case study look at a few people in the tech area that I'm familiar with, I know well.

50:30.800 --> 50:35.800
 We can, the only caveat being that I may have no familiarization with them whatsoever.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.800
 You may have to brief me on them.

50:37.800 --> 50:43.800
 So I'll do my best to reduce human beings into simple descriptions.

50:43.800 --> 50:47.800
 And then you can give me insights of why the hell there are such effective leaders.

50:47.800 --> 50:53.800
 Based on my description, not based on your actual deep knowledge of human beings.

50:53.800 --> 50:59.800
 So that caveat of my inability to speak both English language and describe humans well.

50:59.800 --> 51:02.800
 Let's talk about first Elon Musk.

51:02.800 --> 51:12.800
 So he's known as being quite harsh in the sense of first of all, a very high bar of excellence.

51:12.800 --> 51:21.800
 And also willing to what he calls the kind of first principles thinking of asking the questions that hurt,

51:21.800 --> 51:26.800
 which is why the hell are we doing it this way?

51:26.800 --> 51:28.800
 Why can't it be done a lot better?

51:28.800 --> 51:30.800
 Not just better, but a lot better.

51:30.800 --> 51:34.800
 So let's, I don't want to hear his whole character.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.800
 I'll go one section at a time.

51:36.800 --> 51:42.800
 So we got a guy that's harsh and asking the really hard questions.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.800
 How can that be good or why is that good?

51:45.800 --> 51:47.800
 Well, first of all, it can be horrible.

51:47.800 --> 51:50.800
 And there's leaders out there that are harsh and they're hated and no one likes them

51:50.800 --> 51:53.800
 and no one wants to work for them and they never do anything.

51:53.800 --> 51:58.800
 So what is it that Elon Musk does that gives him the ability to be harsh?

51:58.800 --> 52:09.800
 So I was hearing a description of me when I would give feedback to young seals

52:09.800 --> 52:13.800
 that had made mistakes during training operations.

52:13.800 --> 52:20.800
 And the description was that same thing, like this harsh blunt force trauma

52:20.800 --> 52:28.800
 and just totally direct sledgehammer of truth that I would hit guys with.

52:28.800 --> 52:31.800
 But it's interesting because I always talk about, you know,

52:31.800 --> 52:35.800
 building relationships and making sure you're not offending someone.

52:35.800 --> 52:37.800
 So how do these things match up?

52:37.800 --> 52:39.800
 Well, I can tell you how they match up.

52:39.800 --> 52:43.800
 When I was being harsh, the guys that I was being harsh with

52:43.800 --> 52:49.800
 knew without one shred of doubt that I cared about them more than anything else

52:49.800 --> 52:52.800
 and that the reason I was giving them this feedback is because I wanted them

52:52.800 --> 52:54.800
 to be able to lead their troops.

52:54.800 --> 52:56.800
 I wanted them to be able to go accomplish their mission

52:56.800 --> 53:00.800
 and I wanted them to be able to bring their guys home from war.

53:00.800 --> 53:03.800
 So I wasn't being harsh because it elevated my ego.

53:03.800 --> 53:06.800
 I wasn't being harsh because I wanted to denigrate them.

53:06.800 --> 53:11.800
 I was being actually being harsh because I wanted them to accomplish the mission.

53:11.800 --> 53:16.800
 So if that's where Elon comes from, hey, listen, we got to make this happen.

53:16.800 --> 53:23.800
 This is for the good of the world to do this and people know that, then it works.

53:23.800 --> 53:26.800
 I'll bring this point back up with another guy, Steve Jobs.

53:26.800 --> 53:29.800
 But let me stay on Elon for a second.

53:29.800 --> 53:36.800
 The other thing he does, which is interesting, I see the value of this.

53:36.800 --> 53:39.800
 It'd be great to hear you speak about it.

53:39.800 --> 53:47.800
 It's unlike many of the other CEOs, very rich billionaires involved in leading a lot of people.

53:47.800 --> 53:54.800
 He puts a lot of time into making sure he's on the factory floor.

53:54.800 --> 54:01.800
 He famously sleeps in the middle of things and he puts a lot of effort.

54:01.800 --> 54:05.800
 He's also very good at it, is being a low level engineer.

54:05.800 --> 54:11.800
 Whatever the task is, he wants to understand the details and he'll talk to the lowest level person

54:11.800 --> 54:18.800
 in terms of somebody who's working literally on putting parts together.

54:18.800 --> 54:21.800
 He wants to understand what the problem is, what the challenge is.

54:21.800 --> 54:25.800
 If there's an emergency, he wants to understand the actual details of the problem,

54:25.800 --> 54:28.800
 not like delegating it to a manager.

54:28.800 --> 54:36.800
 Because a lot of CEOs, a lot of managers will talk about the power and the importance of delegation.

54:36.800 --> 54:40.800
 Here, he wants to know if there's a big problem, he wants to know the exact detail.

54:40.800 --> 54:42.800
 He wants to know the exact problem.

54:42.800 --> 54:46.800
 He wants to, at the fundamental level, understand how to solve that problem.

54:46.800 --> 54:50.800
 What it has to do with materials, what it has to do with the actual manufacturing,

54:50.800 --> 54:53.800
 the mechanical engineering aspect.

54:53.800 --> 54:55.800
 We're talking about engineering.

54:55.800 --> 55:00.800
 There's a guy who wears a suit, is a CEO, tweets about Dogecoin,

55:00.800 --> 55:05.800
 but an actual job, he's low level engineering.

55:05.800 --> 55:13.800
 That, to me, was always inspiring to see somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing.

55:13.800 --> 55:20.800
 He gains the respect of engineers at the lowest level.

55:20.800 --> 55:23.800
 I don't know if that's scalable, but that's always been inspiring to me

55:23.800 --> 55:25.800
 and I wonder how many people it's inspiring to.

55:25.800 --> 55:28.800
 Maybe you could speak to the value of doing that,

55:28.800 --> 55:33.800
 no matter how high your level of leader is, to be able to do the low level shit.

55:33.800 --> 55:38.800
 Yeah, and that's a common trait that good leaders have.

55:38.800 --> 55:42.800
 Maybe he doesn't necessarily know how to do everything, a good leader,

55:42.800 --> 55:45.800
 but they go down there and talk to the front line troops and say,

55:45.800 --> 55:48.800
 hey, what is the issue that you're dealing with?

55:48.800 --> 55:51.800
 How can I support you? How can I give you help?

55:51.800 --> 55:56.800
 And one key point that you said is he said when there's a problem, he gets in there.

55:56.800 --> 56:00.800
 So there's things happening at his companies that they're working

56:00.800 --> 56:02.800
 and so he doesn't have to die.

56:02.800 --> 56:05.800
 I'm not saying he never does, but he doesn't have to spend as much time

56:05.800 --> 56:11.800
 working on or looking at some subsystem that's functioning well.

56:11.800 --> 56:14.800
 He's got a good leader in there that's handling it and he checks in with that leader

56:14.800 --> 56:16.800
 and the leader says, yeah, it's working perfectly.

56:16.800 --> 56:17.800
 He says, great.

56:17.800 --> 56:21.800
 When there's a problem, that's when he might have to get down there

56:21.800 --> 56:24.800
 and dig into some details so that he fully understands it.

56:24.800 --> 56:28.800
 So that he, when he digs down in the details and this is important,

56:28.800 --> 56:34.800
 he's coming from an altitude where he has a bigger perspective,

56:34.800 --> 56:36.800
 not necessarily better, but a bigger perspective.

56:36.800 --> 56:41.800
 So if you sit there and work on a problem, whatever, for eight hours

56:41.800 --> 56:43.800
 and you're staring at, you know, if you were planning a mission

56:43.800 --> 56:47.800
 and you were planning it for eight hours, you're staring at the maps

56:47.800 --> 56:50.800
 and the charts and you're figuring out where all the troops are going to be located.

56:50.800 --> 56:56.800
 And I come in after eight hours and I look at your plan from a distant perspective.

56:56.800 --> 56:59.800
 There's a good chance I'll be able to see holes in your plan

56:59.800 --> 57:02.800
 that you couldn't see because your perspective was too close.

57:02.800 --> 57:07.800
 So that's good for me to be able to come in from a higher perspective

57:07.800 --> 57:08.800
 and have a look at it.

57:08.800 --> 57:14.800
 But also there's times where I need to get down there and actually look.

57:14.800 --> 57:17.800
 You know, if you're looking at a problem and you say, look, I can't figure out boss,

57:17.800 --> 57:19.800
 I can't figure out how to get to this target.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.800
 And I'm looking at it from a distance and I don't see,

57:21.800 --> 57:24.800
 I might need to start digging in and looking and saying,

57:24.800 --> 57:27.800
 oh, here's a route that we can take that actually makes sense.

57:27.800 --> 57:29.800
 Let's try that.

57:29.800 --> 57:35.800
 So I think it's a good example of someone going up and down in altitude

57:35.800 --> 57:37.800
 to look at problems, understanding what's happening with the frontline troops.

57:37.800 --> 57:41.800
 And at the same time being able to go back to the strategic level.

57:41.800 --> 57:44.800
 And I can, it's probably this way.

57:44.800 --> 57:48.800
 The reason that he's successful is because he doesn't get stuck down there.

57:48.800 --> 57:53.800
 Because if he felt the need to micromanage each and every part on a Tesla,

57:53.800 --> 57:59.800
 it wouldn't be, it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do all that.

57:59.800 --> 58:05.800
 Now he can hand over some broad chip design and say, hey, this is what the function needs to be.

58:05.800 --> 58:09.800
 And he gives it to Lex and Lex goes there with your team and you figured out and you make it happen.

58:09.800 --> 58:13.800
 If he had to actually do that all himself, most likely not possible.

58:13.800 --> 58:15.800
 So that's what leaders should be doing.

58:15.800 --> 58:22.800
 They should go elevate and then get down in the weeds when they have to and then go back up.

58:22.800 --> 58:27.800
 The sad thing, this is the part that makes me not want to do a startup,

58:27.800 --> 58:32.800
 is basically his whole life is dealing with emergencies.

58:32.800 --> 58:39.800
 Just like you said, he's not dealing, this is not shooting the shit about details of engineering.

58:39.800 --> 58:44.800
 It's dealing with like, in the case of a company, life and death,

58:44.800 --> 58:49.800
 like something that can just completely damage the production line, right?

58:49.800 --> 58:52.800
 So he's constantly dealing with emergencies, putting out fires.

58:52.800 --> 58:58.800
 And I don't know if there's something to be said about that psychology of how,

58:58.800 --> 59:03.800
 like he's spoken himself that he's worried whether his mind can hold up much longer.

59:03.800 --> 59:09.800
 So hopefully in the near future, he will start to form more decentralized command

59:09.800 --> 59:12.800
 where he has some subordinate leadership that he fully trusts.

59:12.800 --> 59:18.800
 And most important that he has properly trained so that they can handle these day to day fires,

59:18.800 --> 59:20.800
 at least 80% of them.

59:20.800 --> 59:25.800
 So only 20% of the time, does he actually need to go in and solve a problem?

59:25.800 --> 59:30.800
 If he's not doing that right now, then that's going to end up being a problem.

59:30.800 --> 59:34.800
 So I work with companies all the time, and that's what's interesting about this is,

59:34.800 --> 59:38.800
 I go and work with a CEO or with a C suite of a company.

59:38.800 --> 59:40.800
 It takes a little while to figure out what's going on.

59:40.800 --> 59:44.800
 I'm kind of going off of the things that you're telling me almost anecdotally, right?

59:44.800 --> 59:45.800
 Yes.

59:45.800 --> 59:53.800
 But let's say that, and also I don't know how familiar you actually are with the inner workings of his companies,

59:53.800 --> 59:59.800
 but if we were to assume that what you're saying is accurate, then my advice would be,

59:59.800 --> 1:00:05.800
 hey, listen, you need to start putting a little bit more time and effort into training up some subordinate leadership

1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:13.800
 that has the trust, knowledge, and expertise that you will be able to turn over some of these details to.

1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:14.800
 For two reasons.

1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:20.800
 Number one, so you can let your brain, you can survive a little longer, as he put it.

1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:24.800
 So all the time that you spend as a leader looking down and into your organization,

1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:26.800
 it's time that you're not looking up and out.

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:30.800
 So when you're not looking up and out, you're not seeing what the competitor's doing.

1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:31.800
 You're not seeing where the market's going.

1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:34.800
 There's problems that can come from that.

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:37.800
 So if right now he's spending too much time looking down and in,

1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:39.800
 and you mentioned, you know, you said, I don't know if I want to do a startup.

1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:42.800
 When you do a startup, you're going to be looking down and in for a while.

1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:43.800
 It's going to take a while.

1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:45.800
 You're going to have to do all this work yourself.

1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:49.800
 You're not going to have the finances to put people manpower behind these things.

1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:55.800
 So that's probably he, maybe he's in that mindset a little bit because he's done so many startups over the years.

1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:59.800
 And so he's in the, he's habitually in the weeds.

1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:05.800
 So my advice would be, all right, let's start looking at formulating some subordinate leadership that has that.

1:01:05.800 --> 1:01:14.800
 Like I said, the expertise, the trust that you can, you can start to turn over some of these more minute details to them so that you can start looking up and out.

1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:19.800
 Yeah, I think he's done that more successfully in some places than others.

1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:32.800
 The SpaceX, a lot of people give the credit to Gwen Shotwell for the CEO, the CEO of SpaceX as a very successful person that runs shit.

1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:34.800
 But in Tesla, not as much.

1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:39.800
 So I wonder if you can comment on something a lot of people worry about.

1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:55.800
 And this applies to a lot of tech companies, which is a lot of people worry about that if Elon disappears, the, the, the innovative spirit, the company is, as we know them today will collapse.

1:01:55.800 --> 1:02:01.800
 We'll stagnate and we'll basically fail to do what they've been doing for so many years successfully.

1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:13.800
 Is there some aspect to what makes a good leader that if you disappear, it's still, the thing still lives on and not just lives on, but thrives.

1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:14.800
 Yeah.

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:20.800
 So what we have to do in those situations is we have to establish a strong culture inside that organization.

1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:25.800
 And if you're, there's, there's, there's reasons why this happens, right?

1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:35.800
 If I have a big ego and I form a company and I love the fact that everyone looks at me and says, oh, Jaco made this company and he's the creative force behind this company.

1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:37.800
 And that fuels my ego and it makes me feel good.

1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:39.800
 And, you know, I'm working with you, Lex.

1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:43.800
 And every time you come up with an idea, I say, Lex, you need to stay in your box.

1:02:43.800 --> 1:02:44.800
 Yeah.

1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:45.800
 Right.

1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:50.800
 So I'm not creating a culture that rewards that sort of creativity.

1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:59.800
 And eventually when I die, I won't have educated my team on how to maintain that creative aspect.

1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:14.800
 So again, hopefully inside that organization, he's, he's encouraging and growing that culture where creativity is rewarded, where, where it flourishes, even when he's gone.

1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:16.800
 That's what we have to hope for.

1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:21.800
 He is, but I also seem to notice that there's not many people like him.

1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:27.800
 People become complacent too easily.

1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:31.800
 I've been disappointed by people a little bit.

1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:34.800
 It's like success makes people soft.

1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:40.800
 With Elon, it seems like success doesn't have any effect.

1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:42.800
 It's like the reverse effect.

1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:47.800
 It doesn't, it's like, what's the net, it's always like, what's the next biggest thing, right?

1:03:47.800 --> 1:04:02.800
 He's living that exponential growth, which I think that's the problem that you have to have somebody who's constantly trying to find the 10x solution, like trying to constantly improve things and restlessly.

1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:10.800
 That, I mean, that probably has to do with finding the right people, not just creating the culture, but creating a culture with the right set of people.

1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:18.800
 Speaking of which, Steve Jobs, there's two things I want to mention there.

1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:22.800
 One, once again, the harshness, but a very different kind.

1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:24.800
 And the second is team building.

1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:34.800
 So on the harshness, he is much harsher than Elon in the following way.

1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:39.800
 And I'm having a sense that you will not like this, but I'd like to defend it.

1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:42.800
 He loses his shit quite a bit.

1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:47.800
 He was famously, at least especially early on, being very emotional.

1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:50.800
 He was letting passion dominate the discussion.

1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:52.800
 There would be a lot of firings.

1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:57.800
 There would be a lot of mean things said to people.

1:04:57.800 --> 1:04:59.800
 I don't know what you make of that.

1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:06.800
 How much is a leader, are you allowed to just lose your shit and your love for the thing you're doing?

1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:08.800
 And how effective is that?

1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:12.800
 As a leader, you shouldn't be doing that very often.

1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:18.800
 So you can look back at me and say, well, Jocko, here's the most profitable company that's ever existed.

1:05:18.800 --> 1:05:20.800
 And so you're wrong.

1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:26.800
 Well, going back to that multitude of characteristics that human beings can have,

1:05:26.800 --> 1:05:31.800
 well, the same thing with businesses, the same thing with companies.

1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:36.800
 Steve Jobs was off the charts in some of his traits.

1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:40.800
 His ability to understand design.

1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:45.800
 His ability to understand human interface with computer systems.

1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:59.800
 So far off the charts, that despite his bad temper, emotional behavior, the company still thrived.

1:05:59.800 --> 1:06:01.800
 That can happen.

1:06:01.800 --> 1:06:11.800
 You can have people that are horrible leaders that develop something that's so universally outstanding

1:06:11.800 --> 1:06:15.800
 that you end up with a company that's successful.

1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:18.800
 The reason, I mean, I get asked that a bunch.

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:24.800
 People always ask me because I say, look, you shouldn't be losing your temper as a leader.

1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:25.800
 Well, what about Steve Jobs?

1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:27.800
 He used to yell and scream all the time.

1:06:27.800 --> 1:06:28.800
 Great.

1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:33.800
 When people say that to me, I say, oh, okay, are you as good at design as Steve Jobs was?

1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:38.800
 Are you as good at marketing as Steve Jobs was?

1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:42.800
 He had a certain amount of skills that were off the charts.

1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:49.800
 And so he was able to be successful despite the fact that he would lose his temper, treat people horribly.

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:50.800
 That's not good.

1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:51.800
 It's not good.

1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:56.800
 And it would have been even more successful if he wouldn't have those characteristics.

1:06:56.800 --> 1:07:03.800
 Now you might say, well, his anger is what pushed things.

1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:06.800
 Well, let me ask you this.

1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:12.800
 What leader wins the leader whose team is afraid?

1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:20.800
 The team who executes the mission because they're afraid of their leader or executes the task because they're afraid of their leader

1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:26.800
 or the team that loves their leader so much that they don't want to let them down.

1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:27.800
 Which team wins?

1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:33.800
 You're implying a confidence that love is more powerful than fear, but I'm not so sure.

1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:35.800
 This is the Machiavelli question.

1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:46.800
 You're saying ultimately it's always better to lead by inspiration and love than by putting the fear into the team.

1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:57.800
 What I'm saying is that I've seen countless times is me leading through my authority, leading through my rank, leading through punitive measures

1:07:57.800 --> 1:08:05.800
 is infinitely worse than me and you working together as a team to win.

1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:26.800
 On the second point is Steve Jobs. He has this idea of philosophy of A players where you have a group, the power and the productivity of a group of what he called A players is invaluable.

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:40.800
 You want to get a team of people who are the best at what they do, but the most important aspect to him was that a single quote unquote B player on the team destroys the entire productivity of the team.

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:42.800
 Is there something that brings true to that?

1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:54.800
 This could be a temper thing, but vicious about firing and removing what he felt was a toxic B player in a team.

1:08:54.800 --> 1:09:00.800
 So A players feed off of each other unless there's one B player present.

1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:03.800
 Depends on the nature of the B player.

1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:08.800
 Is the player a B player because he's a little bit lazy?

1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:14.800
 Is he a B player because he doesn't have good vision?

1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:22.800
 Is he a B player because he's got a big ego and always thinks he's right and now creates conflict in the team?

1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:24.800
 A bunch of different B players.

1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:28.800
 Look, if you're working for me and you're kind of a B player, but guess what?

1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:30.800
 You're a grinder and you get stuff done.

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:31.800
 I want you on the team.

1:09:31.800 --> 1:09:39.800
 You might not be the smartest person I have, but I know that you're committed to the team and I want you on the team.

1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:42.800
 So you're a B player, but that's okay.

1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:51.800
 Now, if you're Lex with a giant ego, I'd rather have Lex that's not quite as smart because I got other people that are smart.

1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:53.800
 I got other people that are smart on the team.

1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:57.800
 Look, you're going to need some smart people on the team, but a team is made up.

1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:58.800
 It's a team.

1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:07.800
 And so you take these different components of a team and if you have complimentary components, you'll end up with a superior team.

1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:11.800
 Then just basing it on the level and what's an A player?

1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:18.800
 Sometimes in the SEAL teams, they would get something called the stacked platoon.

1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:30.800
 And what that would be is someone, you know, some senior person in that platoon would manipulate and maneuver to get the quote best guys that he could in that platoon.

1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:35.800
 So, you know, the most experienced guys, the person that had great, great reputations.

1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:37.800
 And sometimes those platoons would be great.

1:10:37.800 --> 1:10:45.800
 Sometimes they would implode because what you end up with is a bunch of A players and now no one wants to follow anyone else.

1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:47.800
 No one wants to agree with anyone else.

1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:48.800
 Everyone wants to do it my way.

1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:49.800
 Not it's my way, not Lex's way.

1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:50.800
 Lex is stupid.

1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:51.800
 No, you're stupid.

1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:53.800
 We end up with problems.

1:10:53.800 --> 1:10:56.800
 So can one person derail a team?

1:10:56.800 --> 1:10:58.800
 Absolutely.

1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:05.800
 Under good leadership, one person should not derail a team.

1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:07.800
 This could be a tech thing too.

1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:15.800
 There's some multiplying effect of just pure excellence, no matter the personalities.

1:11:15.800 --> 1:11:20.800
 I think for Steve Jobs, the ego doesn't matter.

1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:21.800
 None of that matters.

1:11:21.800 --> 1:11:26.800
 What matters is the quality of the output, the genius of the result.

1:11:26.800 --> 1:11:28.800
 And that somehow multiplies itself.

1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:36.800
 And the egos actually, like one of the problems with egos is like, what does ego usually say?

1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:38.800
 It says, I'm much better than you.

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.800
 When you have people that are really good together, it's very hard for the ego to flourish.

1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:45.800
 Because you're constantly being shown that you're not as good.

1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:47.800
 And there's a competition.

1:11:47.800 --> 1:12:00.800
 So I think his idea was that if you get people that are really good at what they do, it turns as opposed to you being complacent and not doing much and thinking you're better than everyone else.

1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:04.800
 And your opinion is better is you almost getting in that competitive race.

1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:14.800
 That magic that happens when you're at the end of a marathon and you're just head to head, you're just going full steam with a person that is as good as you.

1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:16.800
 There's no place for ego there.

1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:17.800
 Which is great.

1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:18.800
 Which is great.

1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:20.800
 Let's use that example.

1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:21.800
 You and I are racing.

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:23.800
 We're at the end of the marathon.

1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:25.800
 We're both highly competitive.

1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:26.800
 Highly competitive.

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:29.800
 We have massive egos and we both want to win.

1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:36.800
 We both want to win so bad that we give everything we've got.

1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:38.800
 That's totally positive, right?

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:39.800
 Yeah.

1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:40.800
 Isn't that totally positive?

1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:41.800
 Now imagine this.

1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:43.800
 Same thing.

1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:44.800
 We're in a race.

1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:45.800
 We're in a marathon.

1:12:45.800 --> 1:12:46.800
 We're in the last 100 meters.

1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:48.800
 It's you against me.

1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:50.800
 And our egos are huge and we're pushing to win.

1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:53.800
 And you start to pull ahead of me.

1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:56.800
 And my ego is so big.

1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:03.800
 And I hate losing so much that I somehow accidentally push my knee up against your foot on a back

1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:06.800
 stride and throw you onto your face.

1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:13.800
 So that's what ego, ego is an awesome driver unless you let your ego control you.

1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:18.800
 And you let ego drive your decision making process, in which case it turns into an incredible

1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:19.800
 problem.

1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:23.800
 So you might have someone that is excellent.

1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:25.800
 You might have someone that's outstanding.

1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:28.800
 You might have someone that's tens across the board.

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:32.800
 But their ego is so big that they can't work with other people.

1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:34.800
 They can't accept anyone else's ideas.

1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:37.800
 They can't compromise on something because they think their ideas better all the time.

1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:40.800
 And that is going to be problematic.

1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:42.800
 And I don't want them on the team.

1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:45.800
 Now, as a good leader, guess what I'll do?

1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:52.800
 I'll put them into a situation where I can utilize their best aspects but not have their

1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:54.800
 ego destroy the team.

1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:56.800
 So I might say, hey Lex, you know what?

1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:00.800
 I actually want you to take lead on this part of the project over here.

1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:04.800
 And since you're so smart and you work so hard, I know you're going to pull ahead of

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:05.800
 everyone else.

1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:07.800
 So you grind on that.

1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:11.800
 Once you get that result, give it to me and I'm going to disseminate it to the team.

1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:21.800
 So I isolate you from wrecking yourself and the rest of the team with your giant ego.

1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:26.800
 So then looking at a completely opposite person, this is a fascinating person to me,

1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:31.800
 Sander Prachai, who's the CEO of Alphabet, CEO of Google.

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:42.800
 I admire the, in a romantic sense, the madness that is Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:51.800
 So to me, the opposite of that, Sander Prachai, who's like, everybody loves him.

1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:54.800
 And he's also a great listener.

1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:56.800
 So he always brings people together.

1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:03.800
 And so the energy of that person in the room is like, the basic energy, if I were to summarize

1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:07.800
 it, is like, I want to hear all the voices in the room.

1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:09.800
 That's the energy he brings.

1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:15.800
 And it's almost like he doesn't want to impose a final decision.

1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:21.800
 He wants to hear all the voices and somehow always the decision just falls out.

1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:27.800
 I don't know what to say about that style of leadership, but it's always surprising to

1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:33.800
 me how that love brought a lot of people together.

1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:41.800
 I mean, some of the greatest things Google has done over the past several years could be attributed to that.

1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:44.800
 Continued innovation, bringing out the best out of people.

1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:49.800
 There's, of course, bureaucracy, which I could criticize at the end of the day, which always happens with big companies.

1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:55.800
 I would argue, actually, the dictatorial style of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk helped fight the bureaucracy,

1:15:55.800 --> 1:16:00.800
 which is one criticism I would give of being a listener and being kind.

1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:03.800
 Sometimes you can't cut through the bullshit as effectively.

1:16:03.800 --> 1:16:08.800
 But he's one of the only people I've ever heard of who everybody loves.

1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:13.800
 He's an inspirational figure to millions, especially in India.

1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:16.800
 He's a celebrity in the best kind of way.

1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:21.800
 Is there something you could say about that kind of leadership where you're never the asshole.

1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:23.800
 You're never the dictator.

1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:33.800
 You're always the listener and the compassionate, empathetic glue that brings the team together, basically with love.

1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:37.800
 Yeah, that's great leadership.

1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:47.800
 If you had to choose for Google for large companies, is there something to be said about what is more effective?

1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:54.800
 The dictator, the ruling by love or the ruling by fear?

1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:56.800
 First of all, everything's a dichotomy, right?

1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:04.800
 And so to think that all the time, you're always going to be able to just bark orders at people and they're always going to listen to you

1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:07.800
 and you're always going to get the best result, that would not be smart.

1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:17.800
 To think that every single time, you're going to come to a 100% consensus amongst the troops and that decision is going to reveal itself without you nudging it along.

1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:21.800
 That would also be short sighted and naive.

1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:29.800
 So what a good leader does is they stay balanced and as much as they can, they listen to what the troops have to say.

1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:31.800
 They take that feedback.

1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:35.800
 Maybe they quietly nudge things and I'm sure he does that.

1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:39.800
 I'm sure he does some nudging that maybe no one even picks up on.

1:17:39.800 --> 1:17:45.800
 I like to say that the best forms of leadership is leadership with minimum force required.

1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:54.800
 So if I can go into a room as a leader and not say one single thing and the team can come to the right consensus and move in that direction, that's my preferred method.

1:17:54.800 --> 1:17:58.800
 Maybe I have to give them a little bit of a nudge, a 10% nudge in one direction.

1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:06.800
 Okay, that's better than me walking in there and giving them 100% dictatorial direction of exactly what I want to have happen.

1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:14.800
 Now, occasionally, if we have an emergency situation, people are starting to be frazzled and they're not sure which direction to go.

1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:20.800
 Then sometimes as a leader, you have to walk in and say, alright, everyone, here's where we're going and people get on board.

1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:21.800
 Why?

1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:28.800
 Because for many years or months or however long, you've trusted them to come up with a plan.

1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:36.800
 When you as a leader trust your team to come up with a plan, the team starts to trust you and you get leadership capital.

1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:41.800
 As you build leadership capital, occasionally, you need to cash in some of that leadership capital.

1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:46.800
 You need to spend some of it and maybe it is, hey, listen, here's the direction we're going right now.

1:18:46.800 --> 1:18:49.800
 We'll debrief it later, but we got to make a move.

1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:55.800
 And the team who trusts you says, Roger, that boss, we got it.

1:18:55.800 --> 1:18:57.800
 And all of them actually do this interesting thing.

1:18:57.800 --> 1:19:00.800
 I'd love to hear your opinion on it.

1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:13.800
 Sander certainly does it to a large degree, which is it's in the process of delegation trusting a person to do a really difficult thing.

1:19:13.800 --> 1:19:23.800
 Like tossing it up and saying, like, I trust you can get this job done.

1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:35.800
 For some, even if your resume does not support that, I'm actually kind of amazed that human beings, when they're given the trust to get the job done, they step up very often.

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:38.800
 That's kind of an amazing property of human nature.

1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:48.800
 People often ask me issues about leadership, and I always say that one of the best tools for teaching leadership and for teaching a bunch of other lessons is leadership itself.

1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:56.800
 So when it happens all the time, when you elevate someone into a leadership position, they do step up and they do make things happen.

1:19:56.800 --> 1:19:59.800
 So that's not surprising to me.

1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:01.800
 You do have to mitigate risk.

1:20:01.800 --> 1:20:06.800
 So saying, hey, you know, Lex, I know you haven't been in the military before.

1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:16.800
 I know you have very limited weapons experience, but I want you to run a target assault on a real mission in whatever country.

1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:18.800
 That would not be good.

1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:20.800
 That would not be a good move on my part.

1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:22.800
 Now, if I said, all right, Lex, you know what?

1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:24.800
 I want you to get some leadership experience.

1:20:24.800 --> 1:20:29.800
 I've got a training mission and it's going to be using paintball and I'm going to put you in charge of it.

1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:32.800
 I got no problem doing that.

1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:36.800
 Some of that is judging human character.

1:20:36.800 --> 1:20:37.800
 It's like there's potential.

1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:45.800
 There's something in this person that they have enough demons or whatever the hell it requires to have that fuel.

1:20:45.800 --> 1:20:46.800
 They'll figure it out.

1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:56.800
 They'll hate themselves if they don't and they'll find the right, they'll find the tools, they'll find the path to achieve whatever the level of perfection they can.

1:20:56.800 --> 1:20:57.800
 It's been really surprising to me.

1:20:57.800 --> 1:21:01.800
 It's been making me rethink the whole hiring process.

1:21:01.800 --> 1:21:09.800
 Because I often, now I'm thinking and looking, so I'm looking for people both for the startup, but just for my own life, for help.

1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:14.800
 And I almost want to see evidence of excellence.

1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:23.800
 But maybe you want to just based on just judgment of human character without evidence of excellence, have people step up.

1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:25.800
 Like Joe Rogan with Jamie.

1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:27.800
 It's a funny side.

1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:36.800
 I didn't understand how little Joe knew about Jamie when he hired him and Jamie stepped up and now runs one of the most successful podcasts ever.

1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:42.800
 And that's an incredible kind of, and he's one of the best producers in the world now.

1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:43.800
 Not to let it get to his head.

1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:53.800
 And by the way, the funny thing about him and one of the best Googlers in the world, the best Googlers, the funny thing about Jamie, this is, okay, you might not like this.

1:21:53.800 --> 1:22:02.800
 But what I like, I'm constantly, exceptionally self critical to a point of self hating sometimes.

1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:05.800
 I deeply appreciate every single moment I'm alive.

1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:08.800
 But everything I've ever done, I feel like a shit.

1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:16.800
 And when I talk to Jamie about everything he's done, just in every way he carries himself, he's so self critical.

1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:19.800
 He's so worried that it's wrong, it's bad.

1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:22.800
 That anxious energy, I love it.

1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:25.800
 Because that's how you lead growth and progress.

1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:30.800
 Like you might, like a therapist might say that's probably not good for your like well being.

1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:32.800
 Fuck it.

1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:37.800
 It's good for the, what's good for your well being is to create awesome things.

1:22:37.800 --> 1:22:42.800
 That's ultimately what leads to happiness is to create the best thing you can in your life.

1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:49.800
 And so when I see that in something like Jamie or anybody I talked to, when you're really self critical, that's a good sign to me.

1:22:49.800 --> 1:22:51.800
 Is that ridiculous?

1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:53.800
 That's not ridiculous at all.

1:22:53.800 --> 1:23:00.800
 And it goes back, you know, you were, the way you were phrasing these questions about what makes a good person and what makes a good leader,

1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:07.800
 the way you phrase them kind of eliminated the normal answer that I give.

1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:15.800
 The normal answer that I give, if you ask me what makes a good leader, what makes a good person is being humble.

1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:21.800
 So when you're going to hire someone for your startup or whatever company you're creating,

1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:28.800
 that is a key characteristic to look for is someone that has the humility like young Jamie to say,

1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:33.800
 yeah, you know, I could have done this better and here's what I can improve and here's what I need to work on.

1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:40.800
 When you have somebody that thinks they know everything, out of the gate, you're already got someone that's going to be hard to deal with.

1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:43.800
 They're going to be hard to coach, they're going to be hard to mentor.

1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:47.800
 And when you have somebody that's truly humble, you barely, again, it's minimum force required,

1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:51.800
 because when you say to Jamie after a show, how do you think that went?

1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:54.800
 He says, well, you know, I did this wrong and I didn't have this set up in time.

1:23:54.800 --> 1:23:58.800
 And you don't barely have to do anything because he's got the humility.

1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:02.800
 If you've got someone that's a big ego and you say, hey, how did that show go?

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:04.800
 He goes, I went awesome on my end.

1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:06.800
 Now, guess what you have to do?

1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:10.800
 Now you have to start applying force as a leader, which is expending leadership capital,

1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:14.800
 which we don't want to do because we always try and conserve our leadership capital as much as we possibly can.

1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:21.800
 And when we have to expend it just to get Jamie to make some improvements, that's bad.

1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:24.800
 So when you go looking for people, look for people that are humble.

1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:26.800
 Now, does this mean you look for people that don't have any confidence?

1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:28.800
 No, that's not what I'm saying.

1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:29.800
 There's a balance to all these things.

1:24:29.800 --> 1:24:31.800
 That's the dichotomy of leadership.

1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:39.800
 But people tend towards, look, I work with a lot of military troops in the past, now I work with companies.

1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:49.800
 The reason I talk about humility all the time is because for someone to get into a leadership position in the military, they have to have confidence.

1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:55.800
 So the tendency is that their confidence is going to outweigh their humility at some point.

1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:58.800
 Same thing with civilian companies.

1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:03.800
 If you get to a point of leadership inside of a company, you have to have confidence to get there.

1:25:03.800 --> 1:25:07.800
 You don't get to a position of leadership inside of a company lacking confidence.

1:25:07.800 --> 1:25:14.800
 So the tendency is for confidence to grow a little bit too much.

1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:17.800
 And we have to put that confidence into check.

1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:18.800
 We have to put that ego into check.

1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:21.800
 Really good leaders, they're confident, but they're humble.

1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:24.800
 That's the balance of the dichotomy.

1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:28.800
 Hear that, Jamie, don't get cocky.

1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:31.800
 On occasion, rarely you talk about discipline.

1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:34.800
 What does a discipline life look like?

1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:39.800
 Doing what you're supposed to do.

1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:44.800
 What if I want to lay on the couch and eat Cheetos and watch soap operas?

1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:48.800
 That doesn't feel like discipline.

1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:53.800
 Do you think you're supposed to do that?

1:25:53.800 --> 1:26:12.800
 Well, you know, you could argue from a sort of meaning of life perspective that perhaps happiness is the most important and if it makes me happy, perhaps that's, if it's fulfilling, of course, eating Cheetos and watching soap operas is fulfilling for nobody whatsoever.

1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:14.800
 Next question.

1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:22.800
 But there's something about discipline that's more than that, which is like the rigor of habit, right?

1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:28.800
 You wake up early in the morning all the time.

1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:32.800
 What is it? Jordan Peterson talks about make your bed.

1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:34.800
 One place where you probably agree with Jordan.

1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:36.800
 People ask me if I make my bed.

1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:38.800
 I don't.

1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:40.800
 There's a disagreement with Jordan Peterson.

1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:42.800
 There we go.

1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:52.800
 You know, when I was younger, before I was married, I didn't make my bed because I had one sleeping bag on it and I would get out of the sleeping bag.

1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:54.800
 There was nothing to make.

1:26:54.800 --> 1:27:02.800
 Now I'm married and I can't make my bed because my wife's in my bed, so I don't make my bed.

1:27:02.800 --> 1:27:13.800
 Okay, so what in your life, maybe we can talk about the one that's most publicly facing, which is you wake up at four o clock or around four o clock in the morning.

1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:27.800
 You post on social media a picture of your watch and being early just to remind people that you are man of your word.

1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:28.800
 What's that about?

1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:31.800
 What's the philosophy of the four o clock?

1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:35.800
 What role does that play in a discipline in life for you?

1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:40.800
 Okay, from that perspective, what role it plays is getting a jump on the day.

1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:48.800
 And when you wake up early and you get a jump on the day and you've got your workout done and you've got a little bit of work done.

1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:49.800
 Yeah.

1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:54.800
 By the time normal people are getting up, that's a win.

1:27:54.800 --> 1:27:55.800
 That's a psychological win.

1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:58.800
 And it's not just a psychological win, it's an actual win.

1:27:58.800 --> 1:27:59.800
 It's an actual win.

1:27:59.800 --> 1:28:01.800
 So that feels great.

1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:02.800
 It doesn't feel great.

1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:18.800
 Maybe when your alarm clock goes off, but by eight o clock in the morning and you've already accomplished some of the major tasks that you have, some of the most painful tasks that you have for the day, you're off to a great start and it's going to feel great.

1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:21.800
 Let's break this down then.

1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:23.800
 What does then the rest of the day look like?

1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:32.800
 What is the perfect, productive, disciplined day in the life of Jaco Willink look like?

1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:34.800
 Wake up.

1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:35.800
 Work out.

1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:36.800
 Wake up when?

1:28:36.800 --> 1:28:37.800
 Four.

1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:38.800
 Four thirty.

1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:39.800
 Work out when?

1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:40.800
 Five.

1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:43.800
 Five to six or seven?

1:28:43.800 --> 1:28:44.800
 No eating.

1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:45.800
 No.

1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:47.800
 And then what does the workout look like?

1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:49.800
 Depends on the day.

1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:51.800
 What's the perfect?

1:28:51.800 --> 1:28:59.800
 We're talking about body weight, lifting, cardio, heavy bag, jiu jitsu.

1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:00.800
 Okay.

1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:01.800
 Yeah.

1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:04.800
 When I say workout, I mean no jiu jitsu.

1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:08.800
 So jiu jitsu doesn't, jiu jitsu comes later in the day.

1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:10.800
 This is just you alone?

1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:11.800
 This is me alone working out.

1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:12.800
 Yep.

1:29:12.800 --> 1:29:15.800
 And I'm going to be doing a wide variety of things.

1:29:15.800 --> 1:29:22.800
 This is the thing that has the pictures of the aftermath with some sweat at the end.

1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:27.800
 So the goal is to do whatever the hell results in some sweat and that takes an hour.

1:29:27.800 --> 1:29:29.800
 Sometimes it takes twelve minutes.

1:29:29.800 --> 1:29:36.800
 Sometimes it takes three hours depending on what kind of mood I'm in.

1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:40.800
 You got some demons to work through or is this just work?

1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:47.800
 Like are we, so you got the David Goggins who's like, who clearly has demons screaming inside

1:29:47.800 --> 1:29:49.800
 of his head that he's trying to work through.

1:29:49.800 --> 1:29:52.800
 Are you just getting the work done out of the discipline?

1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:58.800
 Or is this, I think Joe is a little bit with David Goggins is like, there's some ego.

1:29:58.800 --> 1:30:01.800
 There's some bullshit that you're trying to get out through some of the exercise.

1:30:01.800 --> 1:30:04.800
 That's a good way to kind of humble you is just doing that exercise.

1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:08.800
 Well, exercise is certainly humbling.

1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:11.800
 I mean, but it's physical conditioning, right?

1:30:11.800 --> 1:30:16.800
 It's preparing your body so that you can handle whatever it is you're going to do.

1:30:16.800 --> 1:30:18.800
 Perfect.

1:30:18.800 --> 1:30:21.800
 What do you do after?

1:30:21.800 --> 1:30:22.800
 Let's talk about food.

1:30:22.800 --> 1:30:25.800
 Hopefully surf if the waves are good.

1:30:25.800 --> 1:30:27.800
 Surf for?

1:30:27.800 --> 1:30:29.800
 How good are the waves?

1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:31.800
 Let's say they're good.

1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:32.800
 This is a perfect day.

1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:34.800
 It's a perfect, perfect waves.

1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:36.800
 Why do you surf?

1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:37.800
 It's fun.

1:30:37.800 --> 1:30:38.800
 Okay.

1:30:38.800 --> 1:30:40.800
 This is fun.

1:30:40.800 --> 1:30:41.800
 Okay.

1:30:41.800 --> 1:30:42.800
 Man and nature.

1:30:42.800 --> 1:30:44.800
 It was just like, what surfing is the ultimate?

1:30:44.800 --> 1:30:51.800
 Is the power of the, the infinite power of the ocean versus a little silly looking man

1:30:51.800 --> 1:30:53.800
 on a board.

1:30:53.800 --> 1:30:57.800
 You could say it's the infinite power of the ocean versus a silly looking man on a board

1:30:57.800 --> 1:30:59.800
 or you could say it's fun.

1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:01.800
 Because it's Russian and romance.

1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:02.800
 Okay.

1:31:02.800 --> 1:31:04.800
 This is for fun in the morning.

1:31:04.800 --> 1:31:05.800
 Beautiful.

1:31:05.800 --> 1:31:07.800
 So you're still having eaten?

1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:08.800
 No.

1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:09.800
 Okay.

1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:10.800
 So when do you eat?

1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:13.800
 I'll usually start grazing around 11 o clock.

1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:14.800
 I'm grazing.

1:31:14.800 --> 1:31:19.800
 What's the, what's the diet that's the, is there a perfect diet or do you graze?

1:31:19.800 --> 1:31:22.800
 I'll eat some nuts, you know, something like that.

1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:24.800
 I usually start grazing.

1:31:24.800 --> 1:31:27.800
 Maybe I'll have a little piece of meat or something like that.

1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:29.800
 Does work enter any of this?

1:31:29.800 --> 1:31:31.800
 I'm sure you have a lot of people that want your attention.

1:31:31.800 --> 1:31:32.800
 Yeah.

1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:33.800
 Yeah.

1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:35.800
 So work is about to happen.

1:31:35.800 --> 1:31:41.800
 Cause you know, even if I, if I woke up at four, worked out from five to six, served

1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:51.800
 from six to eight, now I'm starting to work writing, recording, reading, talking to clients.

1:31:51.800 --> 1:31:58.800
 Is there parts of the day where you try to find moments to, to think deeply, to read

1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:04.800
 deeply, to sort of really focus, cause this world wants, it's full of distractions, right?

1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:09.800
 Even talking to, uh, like even work stuff, the emails and all those kinds of things they

1:32:09.800 --> 1:32:11.800
 can, they can scatter your mind.

1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:14.800
 Is there times you seek to have that focus?

1:32:14.800 --> 1:32:16.800
 Well, I read a lot of books.

1:32:16.800 --> 1:32:22.800
 And so usually when I read, I'll be reading for a chunk of time, maybe an hour at a time,

1:32:22.800 --> 1:32:26.800
 maybe a little bit longer, and I might do that twice a day.

1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:32.800
 So I don't know if that counts as what you're describing, but then same thing with writing,

1:32:32.800 --> 1:32:36.520
 when I, when I'm writing something, I mean, I just, that's what I do.

1:32:36.520 --> 1:32:39.100
 I write usually, usually write for about an hour.

1:32:39.100 --> 1:32:42.160
 I can get about a thousand words an hour out of me.

1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:46.720
 So that's, that's sort of what I do.

1:32:46.720 --> 1:32:48.520
 What does the rest of the day look like?

1:32:48.520 --> 1:32:50.520
 Just a lot of work, but when's the jiu jitsu?

1:32:50.520 --> 1:32:52.400
 I want to find out about the jiu jitsu.

1:32:52.400 --> 1:32:56.040
 So round, round four, 30 or five o clock at night.

1:32:56.040 --> 1:32:57.040
 You train.

1:32:57.040 --> 1:32:58.920
 Yep.

1:32:58.920 --> 1:33:04.600
 And how hard you still, how are you doing body wise?

1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:15.240
 They still, is the old man, is the old man still got it or are you talking to me?

1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:19.040
 It'll be good for viewership and ratings if I die before the end of the podcast.

1:33:19.040 --> 1:33:25.920
 So I still train with the same guys and I'll train, you know, so I've been very lucky

1:33:25.920 --> 1:33:28.280
 when it comes to getting injured and stuff like that.

1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:31.320
 So haven't, I've had some injuries, but they're, they're healed.

1:33:31.320 --> 1:33:34.360
 And so yeah, I train.

1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:39.320
 And food wise, you mentioned grazing of some, of some nuts, a very light kind of things.

1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:40.520
 Is there a main meal here?

1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:41.520
 Yeah.

1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:42.520
 At night.

1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:43.520
 At night.

1:33:43.520 --> 1:33:44.520
 Yep.

1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:46.520
 High in protein or is it anything?

1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:47.520
 Yeah.

1:33:47.520 --> 1:33:48.520
 I'll have like a steak and salad.

1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:54.320
 I'll usually have for dessert, I have like a protein shake.

1:33:54.320 --> 1:34:01.200
 So is there a thing where at the end of the day, you will like, you have like a summarized

1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:09.400
 sword and you meditate on death and all those kinds of, is there some weird ritual you partake

1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:10.400
 in?

1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:11.400
 No.

1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:12.400
 You just go to bed.

1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:14.120
 When I get done with the end of the day, I might read a little bit more.

1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:15.120
 Read more.

1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:16.120
 Yeah.

1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:17.600
 Because read early on and read later.

1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:20.720
 Reading makes me tired, usually.

1:34:20.720 --> 1:34:23.280
 So I'll read a little bit more.

1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:28.680
 Is there a key to you that you can speak to that makes for a productive day?

1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:30.320
 Just the way you approach it mentally?

1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:31.320
 Yeah.

1:34:31.320 --> 1:34:34.920
 Write down what you're supposed to do, wake up early and start doing it.

1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:36.400
 And then get it done.

1:34:36.400 --> 1:34:37.400
 Yeah.

1:34:37.400 --> 1:34:40.480
 I know it's a miraculous trick.

1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:43.560
 Can I ask you about Jiu Jitsu?

1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:45.680
 By all means.

1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:48.000
 What have you learned from being a practitioner?

1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:49.880
 You're a black belt.

1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:58.440
 What have you learned from this journey of being a martial artist?

1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:05.960
 Jiu Jitsu for me was the connective tissue that started to join my mind together with

1:35:05.960 --> 1:35:09.120
 all the different aspects of my life.

1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:13.920
 And so Jiu Jitsu for me was really important and I don't think I would be doing anything

1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:16.640
 that I'm doing right now if it wasn't for Jiu Jitsu.

1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:23.320
 So there's various aspects of my life that were in existence, but I didn't understand

1:35:23.320 --> 1:35:26.080
 how they were connected until I started training Jiu Jitsu.

1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:34.800
 The primary things are interacting with other human beings and combat tactics and strategy

1:35:34.800 --> 1:35:37.720
 and Jiu Jitsu and all those things are connected.

1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:42.240
 They all follow the same guiding principles and I wouldn't have recognized those guiding

1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:46.720
 principles if I didn't do Jiu Jitsu.

1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:47.720
 Can you elaborate?

1:35:47.720 --> 1:35:53.080
 Because you've trained for many, many years, what is it the hardship?

1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:58.960
 Is it the humbling nature of just being tapped all over nonstop or I actually don't know

1:35:58.960 --> 1:35:59.960
 how many times.

1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:02.240
 I've tapped more times than you.

1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:03.240
 Okay.

1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:04.240
 So good.

1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:09.840
 Is it just the hardship of physical training, like the honesty of the mat in the sense that

1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:15.920
 you know what works and what doesn't work, which aspects were the most impactful for you?

1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:16.920
 All aspects.

1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:21.960
 So yes, from a humility perspective, when you realize, when you think you know what you're

1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:25.920
 doing, when you think you have certain skills and you realize that there's always somebody

1:36:25.920 --> 1:36:28.840
 better than you and you realize that, hey, maybe I don't have all the answers all the

1:36:28.840 --> 1:36:34.440
 time and you bring that to a leadership perspective and you walk into your platoon and you realize

1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:37.040
 that maybe you don't have all the answers all the time and maybe you should listen to

1:36:37.040 --> 1:36:38.920
 what other people have to say.

1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:43.480
 You bring that to a combat situation and you realize that you think, if you sit there and

1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:47.280
 think that you're smarter than the enemy, you're going to be complacent.

1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:49.240
 You're going to make mistakes.

1:36:49.240 --> 1:36:57.160
 So there's one aspect out of the gate, as far as, you know, if I, if I'm going to try

1:36:57.160 --> 1:37:02.680
 and get your arm, do I attack your arm?

1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:05.120
 Maybe not directly unless I'm a white belt.

1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:06.120
 Exactly.

1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:07.120
 What do I do?

1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:09.160
 When you reach up to defend your neck.

1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:10.160
 That's when I get your arm.

1:37:10.160 --> 1:37:15.880
 Well, if I'm out on the battlefield and there's an enemy position, should I attack frontal

1:37:15.880 --> 1:37:17.760
 assault into that position?

1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:18.760
 No.

1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:20.000
 No, I shouldn't.

1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:23.040
 I should put down some covering fire and I should maneuver around to the flank.

1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:24.560
 It's the same thing.

1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:29.240
 If I'm dealing with you and you're my boss and you've got a giant ego and you've come

1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:32.720
 up with a plan and I don't like your plan, should I walk up to you and say, hey, Lex,

1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:34.200
 your plan isn't good?

1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:35.200
 No.

1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:36.960
 Or should I say, hey, Lex.

1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:39.800
 Can I ask you some questions about how you want us to execute this?

1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:45.080
 Cause I want to make sure I understand your vision.

1:37:45.080 --> 1:37:46.840
 So all these things are connected.

1:37:46.840 --> 1:37:50.240
 And I wouldn't have realized that we could sit here and do this forever.

1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:55.000
 We could, we could, I could tell you these comparisons forever.

1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:59.560
 But this, all this connective tissue, bringing all these things together, I wouldn't have

1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:03.480
 seen it without, I don't think I would have seen it without Jiu Jitsu.

1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:12.400
 So Jiu Jitsu to me had a, had a incredible life impact on me, not look the physical part.

1:38:12.400 --> 1:38:13.400
 Yes.

1:38:13.400 --> 1:38:14.400
 Absolutely.

1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:21.360
 Does it, does it keep you humble when you know that there's a 145 pound individual that

1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:30.760
 can tap you out when you're 220 pound, 25 year old guy and there's a 135 or 140 pound,

1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:37.360
 you know, 46 year old guy that can make you tap out, that's humbling and, and what do

1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:38.360
 you do with that?

1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:41.640
 Do you run away from it or do you continue to pursue it?

1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:44.080
 Same thing with life, same thing with anything.

1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:50.400
 So Jiu Jitsu is an incredibly powerful, not just physical aspect, but it's, it's a way

1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:54.200
 to understand, it's a way of thinking.

1:38:54.200 --> 1:38:56.160
 You've also competed.

1:38:56.160 --> 1:38:58.560
 Is there something you can speak to the value of competition?

1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:06.520
 Obviously you've been through combat, actual military combat is many, many, many orders

1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:14.280
 of magnitude, more high stakes than competition in a, in a silly sport like Jiu Jitsu.

1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:21.040
 Nevertheless, it still has some of the echoes of the same challenges.

1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:24.080
 Is there something you can speak to the value of competition for you?

1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:29.840
 Yeah, competition will reveal weaknesses in your game that you can then go back and

1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:32.720
 train, directify.

1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:37.840
 So that, that's very useful to sort of, yeah, as a testing ground, of course training can

1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:42.520
 be that testing ground as well, or, or that feedback.

1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:43.520
 Yeah.

1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:47.600
 But as you and I both know, if you and I train together all the time, you'll know my game,

1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:48.600
 I'll know your game.

1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:52.120
 And even if we have five other people, we all kind of understand each other's games.

1:39:52.120 --> 1:39:54.760
 And you're not doing something to me that I don't expect.

1:39:54.760 --> 1:39:59.040
 So when I go and compete, I'm good, you're good, you know, this random person has a game

1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:00.920
 that I've never seen before.

1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:03.760
 And I may or may not know how to deal with that game.

1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:05.360
 If I know how to deal with it, great.

1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:08.220
 I get the victory, maybe I don't learn as much.

1:40:08.220 --> 1:40:14.640
 If I don't know how to deal with their game, I get the loss and I get the win of learning

1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:17.840
 what some weakness in my game is.

1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:23.960
 So you mentioned offline that your friends, and you work with Dean Lister, and Dean Lister

1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:30.800
 is one of the people that inspired John Donahue, who I've very much been, I've gotten a chance

1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:33.600
 to talk to quite a bit recently.

1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:36.600
 I don't know what you think about this.

1:40:36.600 --> 1:40:45.680
 This is not a therapy session, but, or maybe it's, it's turning into one, I've, that he's

1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:53.520
 a fascinating person, John Donahue, in terms of creating almost a science to jujitsu to

1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:59.960
 a level that I haven't seen before, which is systems thinking about, like you can think

1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:06.080
 about military combat as tactics in a particular situation, but then you zoom out and you want

1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:10.360
 to create entire systems of tactics in all situations, right?

1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:16.680
 He's very kind of wants to keep zooming out and creating giant systems, and which I appreciate

1:41:16.680 --> 1:41:26.800
 that even though the task is probably impossible to do completely, but there is something that's

1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:35.360
 in terms of competition that he kindled a fire in me that I want to get back out there.

1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:42.240
 He has a particular thing that did it, which is very different from my personal journey

1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:50.960
 in jujitsu, which was to a degree that people I worked with cared about competition.

1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:58.080
 It was always about winning and or doing well, all those kinds of things.

1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:05.960
 For John, it's about winning that like winning is not, is not even the thing that's important.

1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:14.440
 What's most important is winning by submission is or dominance, right?

1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:21.320
 And not just the end, it's the entire time competing such that the only thing that matters

1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:22.960
 is that kind of victory.

1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:26.680
 And that's a very different level of competition that's actually liberating in a certain kind

1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:28.560
 of sense.

1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:36.840
 I remember so much of my competition was about kind of fear of not taking risks.

1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:40.520
 You get up on points or you hold a strong position, you kind of advance and you get

1:42:40.520 --> 1:42:41.760
 more points.

1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:45.600
 Maybe you chase the submission, but there's always a fear of risk.

1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:49.520
 And for him, you embrace the risk.

1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:53.320
 You should not be competing out of fear.

1:42:53.320 --> 1:42:56.760
 Even die by the sword versus stay in safety.

1:42:56.760 --> 1:42:59.040
 I don't know if there's something to be said here.

1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:02.360
 Well, I mean, this is not, you said it's novel to you.

1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:04.720
 It's not novel to me.

1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:09.240
 My entire journey on jujitsu in jujitsu was only about submission.

1:43:09.240 --> 1:43:16.000
 And as you mentioned, Dean Lister is my coach and my main training partner for 20 something

1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:17.240
 years.

1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:23.080
 And if you ever watch Dean train or fight, that's what he's trying to do is submit as

1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:24.080
 everyone.

1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:26.040
 That's what he's always done.

1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:27.480
 That's what he always will do.

1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:32.560
 He, you know, he has the highest, I think he has, in fact, I know he has the highest

1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:36.520
 submission victories in ADCC.

1:43:36.520 --> 1:43:37.600
 That's what he does.

1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:46.600
 So this is, in fact, as jujitsu got more popular and we started seeing people competing to

1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:50.920
 win by points, that was what was novel to me in the beginning.

1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:52.520
 Now it's the standard.

1:43:52.520 --> 1:43:54.640
 So it's not novel to me.

1:43:54.640 --> 1:44:00.760
 I love the fact that John Donahue and all of his troops go out and they try and submit

1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:01.760
 people.

1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:02.760
 I think it's awesome.

1:44:02.760 --> 1:44:03.760
 And I think that's what jujitsu is.

1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:04.760
 All right.

1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:06.360
 Let's ask for some advice for white belts.

1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:09.320
 There's a lot of white belts to listen to this.

1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:10.800
 What advice would you give?

1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:18.200
 You've been in jujitsu for many years in terms of a successful journey through jujitsu.

1:44:18.200 --> 1:44:19.440
 What advice would you give them?

1:44:19.440 --> 1:44:20.840
 People just starting out.

1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:24.360
 Just keep training, keep your ego in check, don't freak out, try and use the techniques

1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:25.440
 that you learn.

1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:29.000
 And all this stuff sounds like I'm saying it, you know, notice how I'm saying it, hey,

1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:32.000
 tap out, keep your ego in check.

1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:35.400
 But the thing is, everyone says this all the time and white belts still start off by going

1:44:35.400 --> 1:44:40.600
 completely nuts for at least three to six months of, I'm not going to let this guy tap

1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:46.480
 me out and I'm going to tap this guy out, not by using technique but by just using strength.

1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:49.600
 And it's just inhibiting your learning.

1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:50.680
 So as much as you can.

1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:52.320
 I know you got to get it out of your system.

1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:55.480
 I know you don't want to tap and I know you want to tap somebody.

1:44:55.480 --> 1:45:04.960
 But as soon as you get that off your chest, then try and relax and try and learn the techniques.

1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:10.720
 It's perhaps counterintuitive, it never was to me, but it's counterintuitive that to start

1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:17.600
 on the journey of really sort of mastering jujitsu or improving is you have to relax.

1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:19.520
 And that seems to be a very counterintuitive lesson.

1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:25.960
 I learned that early on with, thanks to the Russian system, I played piano and like music

1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:31.600
 basically, actually, this is true for basically any sport that includes a human body is like

1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:34.800
 relaxing is the way you, you start learning stuff.

1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:38.520
 You have to learn, you have to literally, and most people don't seem to understand this

1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:44.320
 is like, you have to learn what it means for the human body to relax.

1:45:44.320 --> 1:45:49.040
 Like I guess you have to have enough knowledge of all the muscles involved to know what it

1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:50.640
 means to relax those muscles.

1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:55.600
 So for piano, you have to understand what it means to relax your wrists and your fingers

1:45:55.600 --> 1:45:58.920
 in order to learn how to move them.

1:45:58.920 --> 1:46:04.560
 Like if there's tenseness in the fingers, you're not going to like, you have to learn

1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:08.280
 how to try hard while relaxed.

1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:17.080
 The, I guess the beginner, if you don't internalize this lesson, will try hard by tensing up hard

1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:21.520
 and like trying hard tensing up more as opposed to relaxing more.

1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:26.640
 And that lesson cannot be conveyed through words, I guess.

1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:32.240
 I've had the great fortune of having dictatorial teachers as they do in Russia for, for piano

1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:33.240
 and so on.

1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:38.440
 We get like hit if, if you don't learn to relax, which is a counterintuitive notion,

1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:39.440
 but it works.

1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:40.440
 Yeah.

1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:44.000
 This brings me to one of my favorite pieces of coaching advice that I will tell white

1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.120
 belts while they're struggling on the mat.

1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:48.360
 I'll tell them to relax harder.

1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:49.360
 Okay.

1:46:49.360 --> 1:46:54.560
 Oh, that's, that's beautiful.

1:46:54.560 --> 1:47:01.440
 For somebody who studied war, who participated in war, what do you think is the best martial

1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:13.480
 arts for, let's call it self defense for hand to hand combat outside the constraints of sport?

1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:15.680
 So it's not one answer.

1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:27.640
 The answer to me is jujitsu, boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai, judo, sombo, and on down the list.

1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:29.800
 I definitely start with jujitsu.

1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:35.920
 The reason I start with jujitsu is because in a self defense situation, if you are a

1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:41.960
 big monster human and you want to fight me and you square off with me, guess what I'm

1:47:41.960 --> 1:47:43.520
 going to do?

1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:47.480
 Run away because I don't want, I don't want to get involved.

1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:53.400
 Even if I see skinny little Lex out on the street and you start yelling at me and saying

1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:54.400
 you want to fight me.

1:47:54.400 --> 1:47:55.400
 I don't want to fight you.

1:47:55.400 --> 1:47:56.400
 I don't, it doesn't matter.

1:47:56.400 --> 1:47:58.120
 I don't care if I can beat you or not.

1:47:58.120 --> 1:47:59.200
 What if you stab me?

1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:02.600
 What if you sue me after I get done throwing you onto the concrete?

1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:06.680
 There's a million bad things that can happen and almost nothing good.

1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:13.840
 So for self defense, my first self defense is my feet to get away from you and if you

1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:16.480
 square off to punch me, I can run away from you.

1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:19.280
 If you square off to kick me, I can run away from you.

1:48:19.280 --> 1:48:21.960
 If you push me, I can run away from you.

1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:23.200
 So great.

1:48:23.200 --> 1:48:25.840
 I don't need to know how to box to run away from you.

1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:32.800
 Where this all changes is when you grab me and now I don't have the option to run away

1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:33.800
 anymore.

1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:38.480
 That's why I actually have to know how to get away from your grip.

1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:41.240
 And that's where Jiu Jitsu comes into play.

1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:46.280
 So especially if you get me on the ground, if you, if you grab me and get me on the ground,

1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:50.400
 now I need to know how to get you off of me and get up and get away from you so I can

1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:52.740
 run away.

1:48:52.740 --> 1:48:59.800
 So that's why I say start with Jiu Jitsu and, and from there, boxing, wrestling, judo,

1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:01.800
 sombo, Muay Thai.

1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:06.680
 Yeah, there's, there's certain in the standing position, I mean, I'm, I'm a judo person as

1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:07.680
 well.

1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:14.480
 And the judo is very limited in their understanding of the full grappling spectrum, even though

1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:19.400
 they do all the things on the ground as well, but it's so focused on the feet.

1:49:19.400 --> 1:49:27.320
 But nevertheless, it's important to understand the thing that judo has as a sport that's

1:49:27.320 --> 1:49:36.200
 good to practice, that Jiu Jitsu doesn't is not just the, the skill of grappling on the

1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:43.880
 feet, but the skill of explosive aggression that sometimes Jiu Jitsu is more about in

1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:49.400
 terms of tactics is more about patience and it depends how you practice it, but because

1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:57.120
 so much is about control and technique that sometimes you don't get to practice like aggression

1:49:57.120 --> 1:50:03.280
 explosive aggression and judo is so much about aggression implemented in such a way

1:50:03.280 --> 1:50:06.640
 that the demonstration of power is effortless.

1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:07.640
 Right.

1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:08.640
 That's the beauty of Jiu Jitsu.

1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:09.640
 Yeah.

1:50:09.640 --> 1:50:10.640
 And same thing with wrestling.

1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:13.400
 Wrestling also has a high level of intensity and aggression as well.

1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:14.400
 Yes.

1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:15.400
 Yeah.

1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:16.400
 So that's where, that's where I agree.

1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:20.320
 Judo and wrestling, absolutely awesome.

1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:26.600
 Get some and striking boxing Muay Thai, you know, like the, you should train all these

1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:27.800
 things.

1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:34.120
 Are there books and movies in your life long ago or recently that had a big impact on you?

1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:35.120
 Yeah.

1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:40.400
 The main one is about face, which is sitting right here.

1:50:40.400 --> 1:50:41.400
 There you go.

1:50:41.400 --> 1:50:43.400
 This is written by Colonel David Hackworth.

1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:50.320
 It's the book that really had a massive impact on me from a leadership perspective.

1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:54.560
 And I ended up, I talked about it enough that it started kind of coming back and started

1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:58.320
 selling well and they contacted me and I wrote a forward for it.

1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:05.040
 So that book had a huge impact on me and I still, when I read it, I still get lessons

1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:06.800
 out of it just about every time.

1:51:06.800 --> 1:51:09.280
 This is the Vietnam War.

1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:10.280
 And Korea.

1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:11.800
 And Korea.

1:51:11.800 --> 1:51:16.000
 And he got in towards the end of, right at the end of World War II.

1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:20.760
 So he was kind of raised by the soldiers that fought in World War II.

1:51:20.760 --> 1:51:23.920
 And then he went to Korea and then he went to Vietnam.

1:51:23.920 --> 1:51:27.240
 An exceptional warrior, a soldier soldier.

1:51:27.240 --> 1:51:35.400
 If you can give a little inkling, what made him a soldier soldier?

1:51:35.400 --> 1:51:39.320
 So I, he died in 2005.

1:51:39.320 --> 1:51:41.760
 So I never got to meet him.

1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:50.480
 And I had a guy on my podcast who worked for him in Vietnam, a guy named General James

1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:58.360
 Mukayama and luckily his son had reached out to me and said, I think you're talking about

1:51:58.360 --> 1:52:04.160
 my dad because I read some passage in there that, that Jim Mukayama was young captain

1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:06.560
 Jim Mukayama, company commander in Vietnam.

1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:10.160
 He said, I think you're talking about my dad.

1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:11.160
 Would you want to talk to him?

1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:12.160
 And I said, absolutely.

1:52:12.160 --> 1:52:14.320
 Well, here's the thing that I didn't really understand.

1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:18.920
 And you read one quote, but there's all these quotes in that book that talk about how great

1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:24.000
 Hackworth was and what an incredible leader he was and how he was the best combat leader

1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:25.000
 anyone had ever seen.

1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:29.840
 And all these just really complimentary things that are said by a bunch of different people.

1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:36.240
 And when you read the book, you're reading this guy's account of what he went through.

1:52:36.240 --> 1:52:43.600
 But I never really knew if that was all true or did he just cherry pick his friends quotes

1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:48.960
 about him and cherry picked the stories that he wanted to tell.

1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:53.360
 And so it was very interesting for me when I met Mukayama, General Mukayama, who he became

1:52:53.360 --> 1:52:58.200
 a general eventually, when I met him and we were talking about his life.

1:52:58.200 --> 1:53:01.080
 And I was very curious and I was a little bit nervous going into this interview because

1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:06.520
 I was thinking maybe my hero, my mentor, this guy that I've never met before, maybe he's

1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:12.600
 just an arrogant jerk that talked, talked himself up in this book.

1:53:12.600 --> 1:53:15.360
 So I'm sitting down with, with General Mukayama.

1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:21.320
 And I finally got to the part where he's meeting Hackworth for the first time.

1:53:21.320 --> 1:53:27.600
 And I said, did you know, did you know who Hackworth was when he showed up?

1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:30.720
 So he was Mukay, Muk, Muk, they call him Muk.

1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:38.240
 Muk was the, was the, like the adjutant to the, to the general that, that was going to,

1:53:38.240 --> 1:53:39.840
 that Hackworth was going to be working for.

1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:43.640
 So when Hackworth comes into the office, the first person he meets is this guy, this guy,

1:53:43.640 --> 1:53:46.240
 Captain Mukayama.

1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:51.920
 And so Hackworth walks in and I said, when Hackworth walked in, did you know who he was?

1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:57.240
 And Mukayama says, everybody knew who he was, Mr. Infantry.

1:53:57.240 --> 1:54:03.720
 And so he ended up explaining that everything that is written in there about Hackworth,

1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:08.840
 they just loved him, they adored him.

1:54:08.840 --> 1:54:12.000
 Without the chain of command, it turned out a little bit different.

1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:13.680
 And you know, the title of the book is about face.

1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:19.240
 And if you're familiar, familiar with military drill about face when you turn around 180 degrees

1:54:19.240 --> 1:54:26.120
 and at the end of the Vietnam war, towards the end of the Vietnam war, he was so disgusted

1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:28.080
 with the way that the war was being fought.

1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:32.240
 He was so disgusted with the decisions that were being made by the leadership that he

1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:33.240
 did an interview.

1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:39.840
 He was the first colonel, first senior officer to do an interview that spoke out against

1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:41.160
 the war that was happening.

1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:43.320
 And this is while he's in Vietnam, by the way.

1:54:43.320 --> 1:54:50.200
 So he got drummed out of the army and he was forced to retire and that was that.

1:54:50.200 --> 1:54:53.800
 So there's an element of rebelliousness to him.

1:54:53.800 --> 1:55:00.080
 And you know, when you talk to me about are there times when the leaders making the leadership,

1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:05.240
 this absolute senior leadership, the civilian leadership is doing the wrong things, yes.

1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:08.240
 And there's times when people speak out against it.

1:55:08.240 --> 1:55:12.080
 And there's an argument for it against that too, even, even with Hackworth, you know,

1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:16.400
 did he, when you get, when you quit your job or you do something that gets you fired, which

1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:22.560
 is what he did, you immediately give up all your influence over what's happening.

1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:25.600
 So they get another, they get another battalion commander to take his place.

1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:27.240
 They get another colonel to step in and take his place.

1:55:27.240 --> 1:55:28.240
 That's what they do.

1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:31.840
 And now he can't help anymore, he can't help his troops.

1:55:31.840 --> 1:55:42.600
 But at that point in the war, he loved his men so much that he was sickened with the

1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:47.080
 situation on the ground and he spoke out about it.

1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:50.000
 So that book had a huge impact on me.

1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:53.120
 And like I said, I still, I still read it all the time.

1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:56.880
 I reread it all the time and I always take lessons from it.

1:55:56.880 --> 1:55:58.880
 Let me ask you about love.

1:55:58.880 --> 1:56:05.040
 This is not usually associated with Jaco, but what role does love, in terms of friendship,

1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:09.800
 in terms of family, play in a successful life and life in general?

1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:13.360
 Again, this is putting other people above yourself.

1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:15.520
 Do you see that as love?

1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:18.200
 That's ultimately the implementation of love.

1:56:18.200 --> 1:56:20.000
 I would say yes.

1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:25.040
 Jaco, I've been a huge fan of yours.

1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:30.080
 There's somebody who inspires me to get up early, to get shit done, to be disciplined

1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:33.440
 about my life and to be the best leader I can be.

1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:35.280
 It's really truly an honor.

1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:39.760
 And thank you for wasting all your too valuable time with me.

1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:42.720
 I don't know what you were thinking, but thank you for doing it.

1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:43.840
 Well, thanks for having me on.

1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:48.160
 I can guarantee you I'm not as cool as you just made me sound.

1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:51.560
 I'm just out here, like I said, trying to help people out.

1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:53.920
 And I think you're helping a lot of people out with your podcast.

1:56:53.920 --> 1:56:58.160
 So thanks for having me up here to share some of my experiences.

1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:00.200
 And hopefully I'll see you on the mat one day.

1:57:00.200 --> 1:57:01.200
 For sure.

1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:02.200
 Looking forward to it.

1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:03.200
 Could be sooner than you think.

1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:05.200
 That sounds like a threat.

1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:07.080
 I love it.

1:57:07.080 --> 1:57:09.600
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jaco Willink.

1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:14.920
 And thank you to Linode, Indeed, SimplySafe, and GroundNews.

1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:18.320
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

1:57:18.320 --> 1:57:22.640
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Jaco Willink.

1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:26.800
 There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.

1:57:26.800 --> 1:57:53.160
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
