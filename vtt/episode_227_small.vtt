00:00.000 --> 00:05.060
 The following is a conversation with Shawn Kelly, a philosopher at Harvard specializing

00:05.060 --> 00:09.360
 in existentialism and the philosophy of mind.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.440
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:11.440 --> 00:15.280
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:15.280 --> 00:20.280
 And now here's my conversation with Shawn Kelly.

00:20.280 --> 00:28.560
 Your interests are in postcontain European philosophy, especially phenomenology and existentialism.

00:28.560 --> 00:34.160
 So let me ask, what to you is existentialism?

00:34.160 --> 00:36.000
 So it's a hard question.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.440
 I'm teaching a course on existentialism right now.

00:38.440 --> 00:39.440
 You are?

00:39.440 --> 00:40.440
 I am, yeah.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.640
 Existentialism in literature and film, which is fun.

00:43.640 --> 00:50.880
 I mean, the traditional thing to say about what existentialism is, is that it's a movement

00:50.880 --> 00:57.960
 in mid 20th century, mostly French, some German philosophy, and some of the major figures

00:57.960 --> 01:05.440
 associated with it are people like Jean Paul Sartre and Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, maybe

01:05.440 --> 01:07.200
 Martin Heidegger.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.480
 But that's a weird thing to say about it, because most of those people denied that they

01:11.480 --> 01:14.280
 were existentialists.

01:14.280 --> 01:19.920
 And in fact, I think of it as a movement that has a much longer history.

01:19.920 --> 01:26.160
 So when I try to describe what the core idea of existentialism is, it's an idea that you

01:26.160 --> 01:29.560
 find expressed in different ways in a bunch of these people.

01:29.560 --> 01:37.400
 One of the ways that it's expressed is that Sartre will say that existentialism is the

01:37.400 --> 01:43.960
 view that there is no God, and at least his form of existentialism, he calls it atheistic

01:43.960 --> 01:44.960
 existentialism.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.840
 There is no God.

01:46.840 --> 01:52.680
 And since there's no God, there must be some other being around who does something like

01:52.680 --> 01:59.440
 what God does, otherwise there wouldn't be any possibility for significance in a life.

01:59.440 --> 02:07.040
 And that being is us, and the feature of us, according to Sartre and the other existentialists,

02:07.040 --> 02:11.240
 that puts us in the position to be able to play that role is that we're the beings for

02:11.240 --> 02:18.120
 whom, as Sartre says it, existence precedes essence.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.480
 That's the catchphrase for existentialism, and then you have to try to figure out what

02:21.480 --> 02:23.480
 it means.

02:23.480 --> 02:24.480
 What is existence?

02:24.480 --> 02:25.480
 What is presence?

02:25.480 --> 02:26.480
 And what does precedes mean?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.480
 Yeah, exactly.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.480
 What is existence?

02:28.480 --> 02:29.480
 What is essence?

02:29.480 --> 02:30.480
 And what is precedes?

02:30.480 --> 02:34.800
 And in fact, precedes is Sartre's way of talking about it, and other people will talk about

02:34.800 --> 02:35.800
 it differently.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.280
 But here's the way Sartre thinks about it.

02:38.280 --> 02:42.520
 This is not, I think, the most interesting way to think about it, but I'll get you started.

02:42.520 --> 02:52.600
 Sartre says, there's nothing true about what it is to be you until you start existing,

02:52.600 --> 02:54.600
 until you start living.

02:54.600 --> 03:00.240
 And for Sartre, the core feature of what it is to be existing, the way we do, is to be

03:00.240 --> 03:07.000
 making decisions, to be making choices in your life, to be sort of taking a stand on

03:07.000 --> 03:14.640
 what it is to be you by deciding to do this or that, and the key feature of how to do

03:14.640 --> 03:19.880
 that right for Sartre is to do it in the full recognition of the fact that when you make

03:19.880 --> 03:25.640
 that choice, nobody is responsible for it other than you.

03:25.640 --> 03:30.000
 So you don't make the choice because God tells you to, you don't make the choice because

03:30.000 --> 03:36.160
 some utilitarian calculus about what it's right to do tells you to do.

03:36.160 --> 03:40.960
 You don't make the choice because some other philosophical theory tells you to do it.

03:40.960 --> 03:46.080
 There's literally nothing on the basis of which you make the choice other than the fact

03:46.080 --> 03:50.320
 that in that moment, you're the one making it.

03:50.320 --> 03:54.440
 You are conscious thinking being that made a decision.

03:54.440 --> 03:59.400
 So all of the questions about physics and free will are out the window.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.640
 Yeah, that's right.

04:00.640 --> 04:05.360
 If you were a determinist about the mind, if you were a physicalist about the mind,

04:05.360 --> 04:11.680
 if you thought there was nothing to your choices other than the activity of the brain that's

04:11.680 --> 04:19.080
 governed by physical laws, then there's some sense in which it would seem at any rate like

04:19.080 --> 04:21.040
 you're not the ground of that choice.

04:21.040 --> 04:24.720
 The ground of that choice was the physical universe and the laws that govern it.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.520
 And then you'd have no responsibility.

04:26.520 --> 04:31.080
 And so Sartre's view is that the thing that's special about us, used to be special about

04:31.080 --> 04:39.040
 God, is that we're responsible for becoming the being that makes the choices that we do.

04:39.040 --> 04:44.560
 And Sartre thinks that that's simultaneously empowering, I mean, it practically puts us

04:44.560 --> 04:50.420
 in the place of God, and also terrifying because what responsibility?

04:50.420 --> 04:54.200
 How can you possibly take on that responsibility?

04:54.200 --> 04:55.560
 And he thinks it's worse than that.

04:55.560 --> 05:03.000
 He thinks that it's always happening, everything that you do is the result of some choice that

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
 you've made, the posture that you sit in, the way you hold someone's gaze when you're

05:09.000 --> 05:16.400
 having a conversation with them or not, the choice to make a note when someone says something

05:16.400 --> 05:19.000
 or not make a note.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.640
 Everything that you do presents you as a being who makes decisions and you're responsible

05:23.640 --> 05:24.640
 for all of them.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.040
 So it's constantly happening.

05:27.040 --> 05:35.200
 And furthermore, there's no fact about you independent of the choices and actions you've

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
 performed.

05:36.200 --> 05:41.080
 So you don't get to say, Sartre's example, I really am a great writer, just haven't written

05:41.080 --> 05:42.320
 my great book yet.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.240
 If you haven't written your great book, you're not a great writer.

05:46.240 --> 05:50.360
 And so it's terrifying, it puts a huge burden on us.

05:50.360 --> 05:56.320
 And that's why Sartre says on his view of existentialism, human beings are the beings

05:56.320 --> 05:59.280
 that are condemned to be free.

05:59.280 --> 06:04.200
 Our freedom consists in our ability and our responsibility to make these choices and to

06:04.200 --> 06:06.760
 become someone through making them.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.760
 And we can't get away from that.

06:08.760 --> 06:14.680
 But to him, it's terrifying not liberating in the positive meaning of the word liberating.

06:14.680 --> 06:19.520
 Well, so he thinks it should be liberating, but he thinks that it takes a very courageous

06:19.520 --> 06:23.080
 individual to be liberated by it.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.800
 Nietzsche, I think, thought something similar.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.920
 I think Sartre is really coming out of a Nietzschean sort of tradition.

06:29.920 --> 06:36.640
 But what's liberating about it, if it is, is also terrifying because it means in a certain

06:36.640 --> 06:39.460
 way, you're the ground of your own being.

06:39.460 --> 06:43.120
 You become what you do through existing.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.520
 So that's one form of existentialism.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.560
 That's a stark atheistic version of it.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.360
 There's lots of other versions.

06:49.360 --> 06:54.800
 But it's somehow organized around the idea that it's through living your life that you

06:54.800 --> 06:56.080
 become who you are.

06:56.080 --> 07:01.880
 It's not facts that are sort of true about you, independent of your living your life.

07:01.880 --> 07:10.120
 But then if there's no God in that view, does any of the decisions matter?

07:10.120 --> 07:14.000
 So how does existentialism differ from nihilism?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
 Good.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
 Okay.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
 Great question.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.880
 There was two different ways that you're asking it.

07:20.880 --> 07:25.640
 Let me leave nihilism to the side for just a second and think about mattering.

07:25.640 --> 07:31.280
 Or is there any way that you can criticize someone for doing, for living the way they

07:31.280 --> 07:32.880
 do if you're an existentialist?

07:32.880 --> 07:34.000
 Including yourself.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
 Including yourself.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
 Yeah.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.040
 Sartre addresses that and he says, yes, he says, there is a criticism that you can make

07:42.040 --> 07:47.600
 of yourself or of others and it's the criticism of living in such a way as to fail to take

07:47.600 --> 07:50.280
 responsibility for your choices.

07:50.280 --> 07:54.040
 He gives these two sort of amazing examples.

07:54.040 --> 08:00.400
 One doesn't, I don't know if it reads as well as for us as it did in sort of mid 20th century

08:00.400 --> 08:01.400
 Paris.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.400
 Yes.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.280
 But it's about a waiter.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.400
 He gives this in his big book, Being in Nothingness.

08:07.400 --> 08:13.240
 And he says, so waiters played, still do I think in a certain way in Paris.

08:13.240 --> 08:18.480
 A big role in Parisian society to be a waiter involved having a certain kind of identity,

08:18.480 --> 08:25.200
 being a certain way, taking control of and charge of the experience of the people that

08:25.200 --> 08:31.760
 you're waiting on, but also really being the authority, like knowing that this is the way

08:31.760 --> 08:33.760
 it's supposed to go.

08:33.760 --> 08:40.680
 And so Sartre imagines a waiter who does everything that a waiter is supposed to do, the perfect

08:40.680 --> 08:48.840
 form of the waiter, except that you can somehow see in the way he's doing it that he's doing

08:48.840 --> 08:54.880
 it because he believes that's the way a waiter should act.

08:54.880 --> 09:00.480
 So there's some sense in which he's passing off the responsibility for his actions onto

09:00.480 --> 09:03.160
 some idea of what those actions should be.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.160
 He's not taking responsibility for it.

09:05.160 --> 09:11.600
 He's sort of playing a role and the contours of the role are predetermined by someone other

09:11.600 --> 09:12.880
 than him.

09:12.880 --> 09:20.120
 So he starts acting in bad faith and that's critical because it's acting in such a way

09:20.120 --> 09:25.480
 as to fail to take responsibility for the kind of being Sartre thinks you are.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.600
 So you're not taking responsibility.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.000
 So that's one example.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.600
 And I think any teenager, if you've ever met a teenager, you've known someone who does

09:34.600 --> 09:35.600
 that.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.000
 Teenagers try on roles.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.280
 They think, if I dressed like this, I would be cool.

09:41.280 --> 09:46.320
 So I'll dress like this or if I spoke like this or acted like this.

09:46.320 --> 09:51.440
 And it's natural for a teenager who's trying to figure out what their identity is to go

09:51.440 --> 09:52.440
 through a phase like that.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.800
 But if you continue to do that, then you're really passing it.

09:55.800 --> 09:56.800
 So that's one example.

09:56.800 --> 10:06.140
 And the other example he gives is an example, not of passing off responsibility by pretending

10:06.140 --> 10:12.760
 that someone else is the ground of your choice, but passing off responsibility by pretending

10:12.760 --> 10:16.920
 that you might be able to get away with not making a choice at all.

10:16.920 --> 10:21.040
 So he says, you're always, everything you do is a result of your choices.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.720
 And so he gives this other example.

10:22.720 --> 10:31.900
 Where you are on the first date, first date, and the date, the evening reaches moments

10:31.900 --> 10:40.960
 when might be appropriate for one person to hold the hand of the other.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.040
 That's the moment in the date where you are.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.080
 And so you make a choice.

10:45.080 --> 10:50.300
 You decide, I think it's that time and you hold the hand.

10:50.300 --> 10:54.520
 And what should happen is that the other person also makes a choice on Sartre's view, either

10:54.520 --> 11:01.000
 they reject the hand, not that time, and I'm taking responsibility for that, or they grasp

11:01.000 --> 11:03.760
 the hand back, that's a choice.

11:03.760 --> 11:08.760
 But there's a thing that sometimes happens, which is that the other person leaves the

11:08.760 --> 11:15.160
 hand there cold, dead, and clammy, neither rejecting it nor embracing it.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.800
 And Sartre says, that's also bad faith.

11:18.800 --> 11:25.440
 That's also acting as if we're kind of being that we're not, because it pretends that it's

11:25.440 --> 11:29.640
 possible not to make a choice, and we're the beings who are always making choices.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.400
 That was a choice.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.360
 And you're pretending as if it's the kind of thing that you don't have to take responsibility

11:35.360 --> 11:36.360
 for.

11:36.360 --> 11:41.040
 So both of the examples you've given, there's some sense in which the social interactions

11:41.040 --> 11:47.680
 between humans is the kind of moving away from the full responsibility that you as a

11:47.680 --> 11:52.720
 human in the view of existentialism should take on.

11:52.720 --> 11:59.480
 So isn't the basic conversation a delegation of responsibility, just holding a hand there?

11:59.480 --> 12:04.400
 You're putting some of the responsibility into the court of the other person.

12:04.400 --> 12:13.840
 And for the waiter, if you're existing a society, you are generally trying on a role.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.120
 All of us are trying on a role.

12:15.120 --> 12:21.400
 Me wearing clothes is me trying on a role that I was told to try as opposed to walking

12:21.400 --> 12:23.680
 around naked all the time.

12:23.680 --> 12:31.440
 There's like standards of how you operate, and that's a decision that's not my own.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.840
 That's me seeing what everyone else is doing and copying them.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.960
 Yeah, exactly.

12:35.960 --> 12:43.520
 So Sartre thinks that in the ideal, you should try to resist that.

12:43.520 --> 12:51.880
 Other existentialists think that that's actually a clue to how you should live well.

12:51.880 --> 12:56.280
 So Sartre says somewhere else, hell is other people.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.000
 Why is hell other people for Sartre?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.320
 Well, because other people are making choices also.

13:01.320 --> 13:09.240
 And when other people make choices, they put some pressure on me to think that the choice

13:09.240 --> 13:17.160
 they made is one that I should copy or one that I should sort of promote.

13:17.160 --> 13:21.720
 But if I do it because they did it, then I'm in bad faith for Sartre.

13:21.720 --> 13:28.560
 So it is as if Sartre's view is like we would be better if we were all alone.

13:28.560 --> 13:33.360
 This is really simplifying Sartre's position, and this is really just mostly Sartre in a

13:33.360 --> 13:36.720
 certain period of his formation.

13:36.720 --> 13:41.360
 But anyhow, we can imagine that view, and I think there's something to the idea that

13:41.360 --> 13:44.480
 Sartre is attracted to it, at least in the mid 40s.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.680
 Can you dig into hell as other people?

13:46.680 --> 13:53.600
 Is there some, obviously it's kind of almost like a literary, like you push the point strongly

13:53.600 --> 14:01.120
 to really explore that point, but is there some sense in that other people ruin the experience

14:01.120 --> 14:03.320
 of what it means to be human?

14:03.320 --> 14:08.680
 I think for Sartre, the phenomenon is this, it's not just that you wear clothes because

14:08.680 --> 14:10.440
 people wear clothes in our society.

14:10.440 --> 14:15.360
 You have a particular style, you wear a particular kind of clothes.

14:15.360 --> 14:22.440
 And for Sartre, to have that style authentically in good faith rather than in bad faith, it

14:22.440 --> 14:23.880
 has to come from you.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.000
 You have to make the choice.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.880
 But other people are making choices also, and you're looking at their choices and you're

14:30.880 --> 14:33.200
 thinking that guy looks good.

14:33.200 --> 14:39.200
 Maybe I could try that one on, and if you try it on because you were influenced by the

14:39.200 --> 14:43.760
 fact that you thought that guy was doing it well, then there's some important sense in

14:43.760 --> 14:50.880
 which, although that's a resource for a choice for you, it's also acting in bad faith.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.120
 And God wouldn't do that, right?

14:53.120 --> 14:55.680
 God wouldn't be influenced by other's decisions.

14:55.680 --> 14:59.880
 And if that's the model, then that's, I think that's the sense in which he thinks hell is

14:59.880 --> 15:00.880
 other people.

15:00.880 --> 15:07.520
 And I think parenting is then, because God doesn't have a parent, so aren't we significantly

15:07.520 --> 15:12.320
 influenced first of all in the first few years of life?

15:12.320 --> 15:18.600
 And even the teenager is resisting, learning through resistance.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.600
 Absolutely.

15:19.600 --> 15:28.000
 I mean, I think what you're pushing on is the intuition that the ideal that Sartre's

15:28.000 --> 15:31.560
 aiming at is a kind of inhuman ideal.

15:31.560 --> 15:37.800
 I mean, there's many ways in which we're not like the traditional view of what God was.

15:37.800 --> 15:46.680
 One is that we're not self generating, we have parents, we're raised into traditions

15:46.680 --> 15:53.640
 and social norms, and we're raised into an understanding of what's appropriate and inappropriate

15:53.640 --> 15:55.680
 to do.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.120
 And I think that's a deep intuition.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.280
 I think that's exactly right.

16:01.280 --> 16:06.320
 Martin Heidegger, who's the philosopher that Sartre thinks he's sort of taking this from,

16:06.320 --> 16:12.680
 but I think Sartre's a kind of brilliant French misinterpretation of Heidegger's German

16:12.680 --> 16:19.800
 phenomenological view, Heidegger says, a crucial aspect of what it is to be us is our

16:19.800 --> 16:26.400
 thrownness, we're thrown into a situation, we're thrown into history, we're thrown into

16:26.400 --> 16:30.280
 our parental lineage, and we don't choose it.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.400
 That's stuff that we don't choose, we couldn't choose.

16:33.400 --> 16:38.800
 If we were God and we existed outside of time, maybe, but we're not, we're finite in the

16:38.800 --> 16:46.160
 sense that we have a beginning that we never chose, we have an end that we're often trying

16:46.160 --> 16:51.400
 to resist or put off or something, and in between, there's a whole bunch of stuff that

16:51.400 --> 16:56.680
 organizes us without our ever having made the choice, and without our being the kind

16:56.680 --> 17:00.680
 of being that could make the choice to allow it to organize us.

17:00.680 --> 17:05.840
 We have a complicated relationship to that stuff, and I think we should talk about that

17:05.840 --> 17:11.200
 at a certain point, but the first move is to say, Sartre's just got a sort of descriptive

17:11.200 --> 17:17.400
 problem, he's missed this basic fact that there's an awful, there has to be an awful

17:17.400 --> 17:25.560
 lot about us that's settled without our having made the choice to settle it that way.

17:25.560 --> 17:32.120
 Right, the thrownness of life, that's a fundamental part of life, you can't just escape it.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.320
 Exactly, you can't escape it altogether.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.320
 Altogether.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.480
 Yeah, exactly, you can't escape it altogether.

17:37.480 --> 17:42.600
 But nevertheless, you are riding a wave, and you make a decision in the riding of the

17:42.600 --> 17:49.000
 way, you can't control the wave, but you should be, as you ride it, you should be making certain

17:49.000 --> 17:53.080
 kinds of decisions and take responsibility for it.

17:53.080 --> 17:59.040
 So why does this matter at all, the chain of decisions you make?

17:59.040 --> 18:03.280
 Good, well, because they constitute you, they make you the person that you are.

18:03.280 --> 18:06.680
 So here's, what's the opposite view?

18:06.680 --> 18:08.800
 What's this view against?

18:08.800 --> 18:16.480
 This view is against most of philosophy from Plato forward, Plato says in the Republic,

18:16.480 --> 18:23.760
 it's a kind of myth, but he says, people will understand their condition, well, if we tell

18:23.760 --> 18:29.000
 them this myth, he says, look, when you're born, there's just a fact about you, your

18:29.000 --> 18:35.240
 soul is either gold, silver, or bronze, those are the three kinds of people there are, and

18:35.240 --> 18:36.840
 you're born that way.

18:36.840 --> 18:42.200
 And if your soul is gold, then we should identify that and make you a philosopher king.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.880
 And if your soul is silver, well, you're not going to be a philosopher king, you're not

18:45.880 --> 18:49.520
 capable of it, but you could be a good warrior, and we should make you that.

18:49.520 --> 18:53.520
 And if your soul is bronze, then you should be a farmer, a laborer, something like that.

18:53.520 --> 19:00.400
 And that's a fact about you that identifies you forever and for always, independent of

19:00.400 --> 19:03.080
 anything you do about it.

19:03.080 --> 19:07.920
 And so that's the alternative view, and you could have modern versions of it, you could

19:07.920 --> 19:15.080
 say the thing that identifies you is your IQ, or your genetic makeup, or the percentage

19:15.080 --> 19:21.180
 of fast switch muscle fibers you've got, or whatever, it could be something totally independent

19:21.180 --> 19:25.040
 of any choice that you've made, independent of the kind of thing about which you could

19:25.040 --> 19:31.480
 make a choice, and it categorizes you, it makes you the person that you are.

19:31.480 --> 19:35.440
 That's the thing that Sartre and the existentialists are against.

19:35.440 --> 19:42.000
 So this idea that something about you is forever limiting the space of possible decisions you

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
 can make.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.960
 Sartre says, no, the space is unlimited.

19:45.960 --> 19:49.760
 Sartre is the philosopher of radical freedom.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.760
 Radical freedom.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.720
 Yeah, radical freedom.

19:52.720 --> 19:57.600
 And then you could have other existentialists who say, look, we are free, but we got to

19:57.600 --> 20:02.320
 understand the way in which our freedom is limited by certain aspects of the kind of

20:02.320 --> 20:03.640
 being that we are.

20:03.640 --> 20:09.360
 If we were radically free, we really would be like God in the traditional medieval sense,

20:09.360 --> 20:15.300
 and sort of these folks start with the idea that, look, whatever we are, that's a kind

20:15.300 --> 20:18.000
 of limit point that we're not going to reach.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.960
 So what are the ways in which we're constrained that that being the way the medieval's understood

20:24.960 --> 20:27.080
 him wasn't constrained?

20:27.080 --> 20:33.680
 So can you maybe comment on what is nihilism and is it at all a useful other sort of group

20:33.680 --> 20:37.200
 of ideas that you resist against in defining existentialism?

20:37.200 --> 20:38.200
 Yes, good.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.200
 Excellent.

20:39.200 --> 20:45.360
 So nihilism, the philosopher who made the term popular, although it was used before him

20:45.360 --> 20:46.360
 is Nietzsche.

20:46.360 --> 20:52.480
 Nietzsche is writing in the end of the 19th century in various places where he published

20:52.480 --> 21:01.240
 things, but largely in his unpublished works, he identifies the condition of the modern

21:01.240 --> 21:06.880
 world as nihilistic, and that's a descriptive claim.

21:06.880 --> 21:14.800
 He's looking around him, trying to figure out what it's like to be us now, and he says

21:14.800 --> 21:22.840
 it's a lot different from what it was like to be human in 1300 or in the 5th century

21:22.840 --> 21:23.840
 BCE.

21:23.840 --> 21:34.240
 In 1300, what people believed, the way they lived their lives was in the understanding

21:34.240 --> 21:38.880
 that to be human was to be created in the image and likeness of God, that's the way they

21:38.880 --> 21:46.160
 understood themselves, and also to be created sinful because of Adam and Eve's transgression

21:46.160 --> 21:53.400
 in the Garden of Eden, and to have the project of trying to understand how as a sinful being,

21:53.400 --> 21:56.840
 you could nevertheless live a life of virtuous life.

21:56.840 --> 21:57.840
 How could you do that?

21:57.840 --> 22:01.200
 And it had to do with for them getting in the right relation to God.

22:01.200 --> 22:07.080
 Nietzsche says, that doesn't make sense to us anymore in the end of the 19th century.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.080
 God is dead, says Nietzsche famously.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.080
 And what does that mean?

22:11.080 --> 22:16.400
 Well, it means something like the role that God used to play in our understanding of ourselves

22:16.400 --> 22:21.920
 as a culture isn't a role that God can play anymore.

22:21.920 --> 22:27.880
 And so Nietzsche says, the role that God used to play was the role of grounding our existence.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.920
 He was what it is in virtue of which we are who we are.

22:31.920 --> 22:37.680
 And Nietzsche says, the idea that there is a being that makes us what we are doesn't

22:37.680 --> 22:38.680
 make sense anymore.

22:38.680 --> 22:41.600
 That's like Sartre's atheism, Sartre is taking that from Nietzsche.

22:41.600 --> 22:46.440
 And so the question is, what does ground our existence?

22:46.440 --> 22:49.320
 And the answer is, knee hill, nothing.

22:49.320 --> 22:55.280
 And so nihilism is the idea that there's nothing outside of us that grounds our existence.

22:55.280 --> 23:00.000
 And then Nietzsche asked the question, well, what are we supposed to do about that?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.280
 How do we live?

23:02.280 --> 23:07.560
 And I think Nietzsche has a different story than Sartre about that.

23:07.560 --> 23:13.160
 Nietzsche doesn't emphasize this notion of radical freedom.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.240
 Nietzsche emphasizes something else.

23:15.240 --> 23:19.360
 He says, we're artists of life.

23:19.360 --> 23:25.880
 And artists are interesting because the natural way of thinking about artists is that they're

23:25.880 --> 23:28.440
 responding to something.

23:28.440 --> 23:32.200
 They find themselves in a situation and they say, this is what's going to make sense of

23:32.200 --> 23:33.200
 the situation.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.680
 This is what I have to write.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.280
 This is the way I have to dance.

23:36.280 --> 23:39.400
 This is the way I've got to play the music.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.880
 And Nietzsche says, we should live like that.

23:41.880 --> 23:48.960
 There are constraints, but understanding what they are is a complicated aspect of living

23:48.960 --> 23:49.960
 itself.

23:49.960 --> 23:56.880
 And there's a great story, I think, from music that maybe helps to understand this.

23:56.880 --> 24:01.840
 I think Nietzsche, of course, jazz didn't exist when Nietzsche was writing, but I think

24:01.840 --> 24:05.720
 Nietzsche really is thinking of something like jazz improvisation.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.320
 I mean, he talks about improvisation.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.320
 There's classical improvisation.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.240
 Nietzsche was, by the way, a musician.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.520
 I mean, he was a composer and a pianist.

24:14.520 --> 24:19.320
 Not a great one, really, to be fair, but he loved music.

24:19.320 --> 24:26.200
 And Herbie Hancock, who's a pianist, a jazz pianist, who played with Miles Davis for quite

24:26.200 --> 24:34.080
 a while in the 60s, tells this kind of incredible story that I think exemplifies Nietzsche's

24:34.080 --> 24:44.520
 view about the way in which we bear some responsibility for being creative, and that gives us a certain

24:44.520 --> 24:50.760
 kind of freedom, but we don't have the radical freedom that's our thing.

24:50.760 --> 24:52.200
 So what's the story?

24:52.200 --> 25:01.000
 Herbie Hancock says, I think they were in Stuttgart, he says, playing a show and things

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
 were great, he says.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.280
 He's a young pianist, and Miles Davis is the master.

25:08.280 --> 25:16.360
 And he says, I'm back in the solo, and I'm playing these chords, and he says, I played

25:16.360 --> 25:22.840
 this chord, and it was the wrong chord.

25:22.840 --> 25:27.400
 He's like, that's what you got to say, it didn't work right there.

25:27.400 --> 25:31.640
 And I thought, holy mackerel, I screwed up, you know, I screwed up, we were tight, everything

25:31.640 --> 25:35.880
 was working, and I blew it for Miles, who's doing his solo.

25:35.880 --> 25:46.920
 And he said, Miles paused for a moment, and then all of a sudden he went on in a way that

25:46.920 --> 25:51.920
 made my chord right.

25:51.920 --> 25:56.560
 And I think that idea that like you could be an artist who responds to what's thrown

25:56.560 --> 26:06.480
 at you in such a way as to make it right by what measure everyone could hear it is all

26:06.480 --> 26:08.120
 you can say.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.640
 Everyone knew, wow, that really works.

26:11.640 --> 26:16.360
 And I think that's not like, there are constraints, not anything would have worked there.

26:16.360 --> 26:19.160
 He couldn't have just played anything.

26:19.160 --> 26:23.400
 Most of what anyone would have played would have sounded terrible.

26:23.400 --> 26:29.320
 But the constraints aren't like preexisting, they're sort of what's happening now in the

26:29.320 --> 26:32.200
 moment for these listeners and these performers.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.640
 And I think that's what Nietzsche thinks the right response to nihilism is.

26:35.640 --> 26:40.720
 We're involved, but we're not radically free to make any choice and just stand behind it

26:40.720 --> 26:42.240
 the way Sartre thinks.

26:42.240 --> 26:47.480
 Our choices have to be responsive to our situation, and they have to make the situation

26:47.480 --> 26:48.480
 work.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.000
 They have to make it right.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.640
 And there's something about music too, so you basically have to make music of all the

26:55.640 --> 26:57.640
 moments of life.

26:57.640 --> 27:03.200
 And there is something about why is music so compelling when you listen to it, something

27:03.200 --> 27:06.520
 about certain kinds of music, it connects with you.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.520
 It doesn't make any sense.

27:07.520 --> 27:13.920
 But in that same way, for Nietzsche, you should be a creative force that creates a musical

27:13.920 --> 27:14.920
 masterpiece.

27:14.920 --> 27:15.920
 Exactly.

27:15.920 --> 27:19.320
 And I think what's interesting is the question, what does it mean to be a creative force

27:19.320 --> 27:20.320
 there?

27:20.320 --> 27:26.360
 There's a traditional notion of creation that we associate with God.

27:26.360 --> 27:31.040
 God creates ex nihilo, out of nothing.

27:31.040 --> 27:35.920
 And you might think that nihilism thinks that we should do that, create ex nihilo because

27:35.920 --> 27:38.440
 it's about how there's nothing at our ground.

27:38.440 --> 27:43.200
 But I think the right way to read Nietzsche is to recognize that we don't create out of

27:43.200 --> 27:44.200
 nothing.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.120
 Miles Davis wasn't nothing.

27:46.120 --> 27:47.880
 That situation preexisted him.

27:47.880 --> 27:54.120
 It was given to him, maybe by accident, maybe it was a mistake, whatever, but he was responding

27:54.120 --> 27:57.480
 to that situation in a way that made it right.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.560
 He wasn't just creating out of nothing.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.680
 He was creating out of what was already there.

28:01.680 --> 28:06.360
 So that makes that first date with the climbing hand even more complicated because you're

28:06.360 --> 28:10.720
 giving a climbing hand, you're going to have to make art and music out of that.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.720
 Exactly.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.840
 And that's the responsibility for both of them.

28:13.840 --> 28:19.560
 Wow, that's a lot of responsibility for his day because you have to create.

28:19.560 --> 28:26.160
 The emphasis isn't just on making decisions, it's on creating.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.240
 But also on listening, right?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.760
 I mean, Miles Davis was listening.

28:30.760 --> 28:31.840
 He heard that.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.840
 He knew it was wrong.

28:32.840 --> 28:37.600
 And the question was, what do I play that makes it right?

28:37.600 --> 28:42.040
 So let me ask about Nietzsche, is God dead?

28:42.040 --> 28:43.800
 What do you mean by that statement?

28:43.800 --> 28:49.800
 What's in your sense the truth behind the question and the possible set of answers that

28:49.800 --> 28:51.800
 our world today provides?

28:51.800 --> 28:52.800
 Good.

28:52.800 --> 28:59.240
 So I mean, I think that there's something super perceptive about Nietzsche's diagnosis

28:59.240 --> 29:02.440
 of the condition at the end of the 19th century.

29:02.440 --> 29:08.360
 So not so far from the condition that I think we're currently in.

29:08.360 --> 29:11.440
 And I think there's an interesting question, what we're supposed to respond, what we're

29:11.440 --> 29:12.640
 supposed to do in response.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.880
 But what is the condition that we're currently in?

29:14.880 --> 29:20.280
 When Nietzsche says God is dead, I think, like I was saying before, he means something

29:20.280 --> 29:26.320
 like the role that God used to play in grounding our existence is not a role that works for

29:26.320 --> 29:29.080
 us anymore as a culture.

29:29.080 --> 29:34.720
 And when people talk about a view like that nowadays, they use a different terminology,

29:34.720 --> 29:37.720
 but I think it's roughly what Nietzsche was aiming at.

29:37.720 --> 29:40.640
 They say, we live in a secular age.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.040
 Our age is a secular age.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.760
 And so what do people mean when they say that?

29:44.760 --> 29:47.600
 I think, first of all, it's a descriptive claim.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.880
 It could be wrong.

29:48.880 --> 29:53.240
 The question is, does this really describe the way we experience ourselves as a culture

29:53.240 --> 29:57.400
 or as a culture in the West or wherever it is that we are?

29:57.400 --> 30:01.240
 So what does it mean to say that we live in a secular age, an age in which God is dead?

30:01.240 --> 30:04.800
 Well, first thing is, it doesn't mean there are no religious believers because there are

30:04.800 --> 30:05.800
 plenty.

30:05.800 --> 30:11.720
 There are lots of people who go to church or synagogue or mosque every week or more.

30:11.720 --> 30:16.960
 And there are people who really find that to be an important aspect of the way they

30:16.960 --> 30:19.520
 live their lives.

30:19.520 --> 30:28.880
 But it does mean that for those people, the role that their religious belief plays in

30:28.880 --> 30:32.400
 their life isn't the same as it used to be in previous ages.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.680
 So what's that role?

30:33.680 --> 30:35.880
 We'll go back to the High Middle Ages.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.560
 That was clearly not a secular age.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.960
 That was a religious age.

30:40.960 --> 30:46.840
 And so there we are in 1300, Dante is writing the Divine Comedy or something.

30:46.840 --> 30:50.520
 And what did it mean then to live in a sacred age?

30:50.520 --> 30:58.720
 Well, it meant not just that the default was that you were a Christian in the West, but

30:58.720 --> 31:06.680
 that your Christianity, your religious belief, your religious affiliation justified certain

31:06.680 --> 31:11.040
 assumptions about people who didn't share that religious belief.

31:11.040 --> 31:19.000
 So you're a Christian in the West in 1300, and you meet someone who's a Muslim.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.960
 And the fact that they don't share your religious belief justifies the conclusion that they're

31:24.960 --> 31:27.440
 less than human.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.480
 And that was the ground of the crusades.

31:30.480 --> 31:35.600
 That was the religious wars of the High Middle Ages.

31:35.600 --> 31:40.920
 To say that we live in a secular age is to say that not that there aren't a lot of people

31:40.920 --> 31:45.600
 who have religious belief, there are, but it's to say that their religious belief doesn't

31:45.600 --> 31:49.120
 justify that conclusion.

31:49.120 --> 31:57.080
 If you're a religious believer and you meet me and suppose I'm not a religious believer,

31:57.080 --> 32:02.520
 learning that about me doesn't justify your concluding that I'm less than human.

32:02.520 --> 32:06.160
 And that's the kind of liberalism of the modern age.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.400
 Most of the time we think that's a good thing.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.440
 We let a thousand flowers bloom.

32:10.440 --> 32:13.120
 There are lots of ways to live a good life.

32:13.120 --> 32:18.360
 And there's some way in which that is a nice progressive kind of liberal thought.

32:18.360 --> 32:24.360
 But it's also true that it's an undermining thought because it means if you're a religious

32:24.360 --> 32:32.160
 believer now, your belief can't ground your understanding of what you ought to be aiming

32:32.160 --> 32:35.600
 at in the life in the way it used to be able to.

32:35.600 --> 32:41.600
 You can't say, as a religious believer, I know it's right to do this because you also

32:41.600 --> 32:45.000
 know that if you meet someone who doesn't share that religious belief and so doesn't

32:45.000 --> 32:50.160
 think it's right to do that necessarily or does, but for different reasons, you can't

32:50.160 --> 32:52.880
 conclude that they've got it wrong.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.880
 So there's this sort of unsettling aspect to it.

32:55.880 --> 33:02.680
 Well, isn't it true that you can't conclude as a public statement to others?

33:02.680 --> 33:10.200
 But within your own mind, it's almost like an existentialist version of belief, which

33:10.200 --> 33:15.880
 is like you create the world and around you.

33:15.880 --> 33:19.600
 It doesn't matter what others believe.

33:19.600 --> 33:26.960
 It's actually almost like empowering thought as opposed to the more traditional view of

33:26.960 --> 33:33.280
 religion where it's like a tribal idea, like where you share that idea together.

33:33.280 --> 33:38.640
 Here you have the full, back to Sartre, full responsibility of your beliefs as well.

33:38.640 --> 33:39.640
 Good.

33:39.640 --> 33:40.640
 Good.

33:40.640 --> 33:44.320
 But what you're describing is not a religious believer.

33:44.320 --> 33:49.520
 You're describing someone who's found in themselves the ground of their existence rather than

33:49.520 --> 33:51.040
 in something outside of themselves.

33:51.040 --> 33:57.240
 So the religious belief, I mean, if you go full Sartrean, then well, you're not in a

33:57.240 --> 34:03.200
 position to criticize others for the choices that they make, but you are in a position

34:03.200 --> 34:08.160
 to criticize them for the way in which they make them, either taking responsibility or

34:08.160 --> 34:10.680
 not taking responsibility.

34:10.680 --> 34:15.120
 But the religious believer used to be able to say, look, the choices that I make are

34:15.120 --> 34:19.080
 right because God demands that I make them.

34:19.080 --> 34:25.720
 And nowadays, and so it would be wrong to make any others.

34:25.720 --> 34:32.960
 And nowadays, to say that we live in a secular age, say, well, you can't quite do that and

34:32.960 --> 34:34.080
 be a religious believer.

34:34.080 --> 34:39.920
 Your religious belief can't justify that move, and so it can't ground your life in

34:39.920 --> 34:40.960
 the way it does.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.200
 So it's sort of unsettling.

34:42.200 --> 34:46.400
 I think that's one of the interpretations of what Nietzsche might have meant when he

34:46.400 --> 34:47.920
 said God is dead.

34:47.920 --> 34:52.920
 God can't play the role for religious believers in our world that he used to.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.680
 But we nevertheless find meaning.

34:54.680 --> 35:00.720
 I mean, you don't see nihilism as a prevalent set of ideas that are overtaken modern culture.

35:00.720 --> 35:03.920
 So a secular world is still full of meaning.

35:03.920 --> 35:04.920
 Good.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.560
 Well, I think that's the interesting question.

35:06.560 --> 35:12.760
 I think it's certainly possible for a secular world to be a world in which we live meaningful

35:12.760 --> 35:21.680
 lives, worthwhile lives, lives that are sort of worthy of respect and that we can be proud

35:21.680 --> 35:24.240
 of aiming to live.

35:24.240 --> 35:28.000
 But I think it is a hard question, what we're doing when we do that.

35:28.000 --> 35:33.560
 And that is the question of existence, sort of what does it mean to exist in a way that

35:33.560 --> 35:37.000
 brings us out at our best as the beings that we are?

35:37.000 --> 35:40.960
 That's the question for existentialism.

35:40.960 --> 35:48.760
 So besides Sartre, who to you is the most important existentialist to understand for

35:48.760 --> 35:49.760
 others?

35:49.760 --> 35:52.360
 What ideas in particular of theirs do you like?

35:52.360 --> 35:55.080
 Maybe other existentialists, not just one.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.080
 Yeah, good.

35:56.080 --> 36:00.720
 So Sartre is the grounding, strong, atheistic existentialism statement.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.720
 Who else is there?

36:02.720 --> 36:05.880
 So I'm teaching an existentialism course now.

36:05.880 --> 36:11.600
 And I think the tradition goes back at least to the 17th century, and I'll just tell you

36:11.600 --> 36:13.880
 some of the figures that I'm teaching there.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.760
 We could talk about any of them that you like.

36:16.760 --> 36:24.360
 The figure I start with is Pascal, Pascal, French mathematician from the 17th century.

36:24.360 --> 36:25.360
 He died.

36:25.360 --> 36:30.040
 I'm terrible with dates, but I think 1661 or something like that, middle of the 17th

36:30.040 --> 36:31.040
 century.

36:31.040 --> 36:34.920
 Brilliant polymath, sort of we have computer languages named after him.

36:34.920 --> 36:43.200
 He built the first mechanical calculating machine, but he was also deeply invested in his understanding

36:43.200 --> 36:46.400
 of what Christianity was.

36:46.400 --> 36:54.040
 And he thought that everyone before him had really misunderstood what Christianity was,

36:54.040 --> 37:01.120
 that they'd really attempted to think about it not as a way of living a life, but as a

37:01.120 --> 37:06.800
 set of beliefs that you can have and which you can justify.

37:06.800 --> 37:11.920
 And I think that's the first move that's really pretty interesting.

37:11.920 --> 37:19.160
 And then figures like Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky developed that move, and all of those take

37:19.160 --> 37:24.760
 themselves to be defending an interpretation of a certain kind of Christianity, an existential

37:24.760 --> 37:27.400
 interpretation of Christianity.

37:27.400 --> 37:32.600
 And then I think there are other figures, other theistic figures, figures like Camus

37:32.600 --> 37:38.080
 and Fanon, who are mid 20th century figures.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.920
 And then I'll just mention the figure who I think is the most interesting is Martin

37:41.920 --> 37:42.920
 Heidegger.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.320
 He's a complicated figure because…

37:45.320 --> 37:51.800
 By the way, when you said, sorry to interrupt, when you said Camus, you meant atheistic.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.920
 I think that Camus is an atheistic existentialist.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.000
 Yeah, I'm happy to talk about that.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.200
 So, okay, so we got, it's like sports cards, we have the different existentialist.

38:00.200 --> 38:04.400
 So maybe let's go to, you know what?

38:04.400 --> 38:05.400
 Let's go to Dostoevsky.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.480
 All right, okay, let's do it.

38:07.480 --> 38:11.160
 So my favorite novel of his is The Idiot.

38:11.160 --> 38:15.640
 First of all, I see myself as the idiot and an idiot.

38:15.640 --> 38:22.240
 And I love the optimism and the love the main character has for the world.

38:22.240 --> 38:25.680
 So that just deeply connects with me as a novel.

38:25.680 --> 38:27.680
 I know it's from underground as well.

38:27.680 --> 38:33.320
 But what ideas of Dostoevsky's do you think are existentialist?

38:33.320 --> 38:36.800
 What ideas are formative to the whole existentialist movement?

38:36.800 --> 38:37.800
 Excellent.

38:37.800 --> 38:42.320
 So, let me talk about The Brothers Karamazov partly because that's the last novel that

38:42.320 --> 38:43.480
 Dostoevsky wrote.

38:43.480 --> 38:48.440
 I think it's certainly one of the greatest novels of the 19th century, maybe the best.

38:48.440 --> 38:52.400
 And I'm about to teach it in a few weeks, so I'm super excited about it.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.800
 But what is The Brothers Karamazov about?

38:54.800 --> 38:58.880
 I mean, without spoiling the ending for anyone.

38:58.880 --> 38:59.880
 Spoiler alert.

38:59.880 --> 39:00.880
 Yeah.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.880
 I mean, look, it's a murder mystery, right?

39:02.880 --> 39:06.360
 I mean, the father gets murdered.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.120
 And the question is, who did it?

39:08.120 --> 39:09.480
 Who's responsible for it?

39:09.480 --> 39:12.840
 So there's a notion of responsibility here, like in Sartre.

39:12.840 --> 39:17.680
 But it's responsibility for a murder, that's what we're talking about.

39:17.680 --> 39:24.760
 And there's a bunch of brothers, each of whom has pretty good motivation for having

39:24.760 --> 39:26.800
 murdered the father.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.000
 The father's a jerk.

39:28.000 --> 39:34.520
 I mean, he's, you know, if anybody is worthy of being murdered, he's the guy.

39:34.520 --> 39:38.880
 He's a force of chaos, and he's nasty in all sorts of ways.

39:38.880 --> 39:43.640
 But still, it's not good to murder people.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.240
 So, what's the view of Dostoevsky?

39:46.240 --> 39:54.320
 I mean, it's this intense exploration of what it means to be involved in various ways with

39:54.320 --> 40:00.160
 an activity that everyone can recognize as atrocious.

40:00.160 --> 40:05.440
 And what the right way is to take responsibility for that?

40:05.440 --> 40:10.080
 What the right way is to relate to others in the face of it?

40:10.080 --> 40:16.720
 And how, even through this kind of action, you can achieve some kind of salvation.

40:16.720 --> 40:19.760
 That's Dostoevsky's word for it.

40:19.760 --> 40:26.000
 That salvation here and now, not like you live some afterlife where you're paradise

40:26.000 --> 40:27.920
 for eternity.

40:27.920 --> 40:31.200
 Who cares about that, says one of the characters.

40:31.200 --> 40:35.960
 That doesn't make my life now any good, and it doesn't justify any of the bad things that

40:35.960 --> 40:37.200
 happen in my life now.

40:37.200 --> 40:42.920
 What matters is, can we live well in the face of these things that we do and have to take

40:42.920 --> 40:43.920
 responsibility for?

40:43.920 --> 40:51.960
 So, it's this intense exploration of notions and gradations of guilt and responsibility

40:51.960 --> 40:56.280
 and the possibility of love and salvation in the face of those.

40:56.280 --> 40:59.840
 It is incredibly human work.

40:59.840 --> 41:03.240
 But I think Dostoevsky is the opposite of Sartre.

41:03.240 --> 41:05.680
 And let me just, I think it's so fascinating.

41:05.680 --> 41:10.920
 I don't know anybody else who notices this, but Sartre actually quotes a passage from

41:10.920 --> 41:15.920
 Dostoevsky, when he's developing his view, it's close to a passage.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.080
 It doesn't appear quite in this way.

41:18.080 --> 41:23.360
 But the passage that Sartre quotes is this, it's in the form of an argument, Sartre puts

41:23.360 --> 41:24.720
 it in the form of an argument.

41:24.720 --> 41:29.760
 He says, look, there's a conditional statement is true.

41:29.760 --> 41:34.000
 If there is no God, then everything is permitted.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.840
 And then there's a second premise, there is no God.

41:37.840 --> 41:38.840
 That's Sartre's view.

41:38.840 --> 41:41.600
 I mean, he's an atheist, there is no God.

41:41.600 --> 41:45.000
 Conclusion, everything is permitted.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.880
 And that's Sartre's radical freedom.

41:47.880 --> 41:52.600
 And if you think about the structure of the brothers Karamazov, I think Dostoevsky, though

41:52.600 --> 41:58.000
 he never says it this way, would run the argument differently, is a modus tolens instead of

41:58.000 --> 41:59.400
 a modus bonens.

41:59.400 --> 42:04.200
 The argument for Dostoevsky would go like this, yeah, conditional statement, if there

42:04.200 --> 42:11.880
 is no God, then everything is permitted, but look at your life, not everything is permitted.

42:11.880 --> 42:17.640
 You do horrible, atrocious things, like be involved in the death of your father.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.320
 And there is a price to pay.

42:19.320 --> 42:26.720
 That's not a livable moment to take, to have to take responsibility, to have to recognize

42:26.720 --> 42:33.240
 that you're at fault or you're somehow guilty for having been involved in whatever way you

42:33.240 --> 42:38.680
 were in letting that happen or bringing it about that it does happen, is to pay a price.

42:38.680 --> 42:44.640
 So we're not beings that are constituted in such a way that everything is permitted.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.960
 Look at the facts of your existence.

42:46.960 --> 42:55.520
 So not everything is permitted, therefore, there is a God.

42:55.520 --> 43:00.320
 And the presence of a God for Dostoevsky, I think, is just found in this fact that when

43:00.320 --> 43:05.000
 we do bad things, we feel guilty for them, that we find ourselves to be responsible

43:05.000 --> 43:09.040
 for things even when we didn't intend to do them, but we just allowed ourselves to be

43:09.040 --> 43:10.040
 involved in them.

43:10.040 --> 43:15.520
 And the nature of God for Dostoevsky is, I mean, unclear, I mean, it's a very complex

43:15.520 --> 43:17.040
 exploration in itself.

43:17.040 --> 43:22.920
 And he basically, God speaks through several of his characters in complicated ways.

43:22.920 --> 43:26.400
 So it's not like a trivial version of God.

43:26.400 --> 43:31.920
 It's totally not trivial and it's not a being that exists outside of time and none of that

43:31.920 --> 43:33.720
 is sort of relevant for Dostoevsky.

43:33.720 --> 43:36.680
 For him, it's a question about how we live our lives.

43:36.680 --> 43:40.720
 Do we live our lives in the mood that Christianity says it makes available to us, which is the

43:40.720 --> 43:42.800
 mood of joy?

43:42.800 --> 43:50.840
 Is there, maybe this is a bit of a tangent, but Salma Russian speaker and one of the,

43:50.840 --> 43:55.760
 I kind of listen to my heart and what my heart says is I need to take on this project.

43:55.760 --> 44:02.960
 So there's a couple of famous translators of Dostoevsky and Dostoevsky that live in

44:02.960 --> 44:03.960
 Paris currently.

44:03.960 --> 44:06.440
 So I'm going to take the journey.

44:06.440 --> 44:12.800
 We agreed to have a full conversation about Dostoevsky, about Dostoevsky and like a series

44:12.800 --> 44:14.840
 of conversations.

44:14.840 --> 44:20.320
 And the reason I fell in love with this idea is I just realized in translating from Russian

44:20.320 --> 44:29.280
 to English, how deep philosophical, how much deep philosophical thinking is required.

44:29.280 --> 44:35.320
 Just like single sentences, they spent like weeks debating single sentences.

44:35.320 --> 44:41.080
 So and all of that is part of a journey to Russia for several reasons, but I just I want

44:41.080 --> 44:49.120
 to explore something in me that long still understand and to connect with the roots where

44:49.120 --> 44:51.800
 I come from.

44:51.800 --> 44:59.840
 So maybe can you comment, whether it's on the Russian side or the German side or other

44:59.840 --> 45:06.600
 French side, is there something in your own explorations of these philosophies that you

45:06.600 --> 45:11.680
 find that you miss because you don't deeply know the language?

45:11.680 --> 45:14.760
 Or like how important is it to understand the language?

45:14.760 --> 45:15.760
 Good.

45:15.760 --> 45:19.920
 I think it's super important and I'm always embarrassed that I don't know more languages

45:19.920 --> 45:26.240
 and don't know the languages I know as well as I would like to, but there's a way in.

45:26.240 --> 45:31.000
 So I do think different languages allow you to think in different ways and that there's

45:31.000 --> 45:38.080
 a sort of a mode of existence, a way of being that's captured by a language, that it makes

45:38.080 --> 45:43.320
 certain ways of thinking about yourself or others more natural and it closes off other

45:43.320 --> 45:46.760
 ways of thinking about yourself and others.

45:46.760 --> 45:51.160
 And so I think languages are fascinating in that way.

45:51.160 --> 45:56.560
 The Heidegger who is this philosopher that I'm interested in says at one point, language

45:56.560 --> 46:05.960
 is the house of being and I think that means something like it's by living in a language

46:05.960 --> 46:11.600
 that you come to understand or that possibilities for understanding what it is to be you and

46:11.600 --> 46:16.760
 others and anything are opened up and different languages open up different possibilities.

46:16.760 --> 46:21.280
 And we had that discussion offline about James Joyce, how I took a course in James Joyce

46:21.280 --> 46:27.200
 and how I don't think I understood anything besides the dead and the short stories.

46:27.200 --> 46:34.200
 And you suggested that it might be helpful to actually visit Ireland, visit Dublin to

46:34.200 --> 46:37.480
 help you understand, maybe fall in love with the words.

46:37.480 --> 46:43.400
 And so that presumably is not purely about the understanding of the actual words of

46:43.400 --> 46:47.480
 the language, it's understanding something much deeper.

46:47.480 --> 46:51.800
 The music of the language or something, music of the ideas.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.480
 Absolutely.

46:53.480 --> 46:54.480
 Something like that.

46:54.480 --> 46:58.560
 It's very hard to say exactly what that is, but when you hear an Irish person who really

46:58.560 --> 47:03.800
 understands Joyce, read some sentences, they have a different cadence, they have a different

47:03.800 --> 47:07.360
 tonality, they have different music to use your word.

47:07.360 --> 47:10.880
 And all of a sudden, you think about them differently.

47:10.880 --> 47:15.640
 And the sentences sort of draw different thoughts out of you when they're read in certain ways.

47:15.640 --> 47:18.120
 That's what great actors can do.

47:18.120 --> 47:22.840
 But I think language is rich like that.

47:22.840 --> 47:29.640
 And the idea which philosophers tend to have, that we're really studying the crucial aspects

47:29.640 --> 47:35.320
 of language when we think about its logical form, when we think about the sort of claims

47:35.320 --> 47:39.640
 of philosophical logic that you can make, or how do you translate this proposition into

47:39.640 --> 47:44.160
 some symbolic form, I think that's part of what goes on in language.

47:44.160 --> 47:51.680
 But I think that when language affects us in the deep way that it can, when great poets

47:51.680 --> 47:58.440
 or great writers or great thinkers use it to great effect, it's way more than that.

47:58.440 --> 48:01.080
 And that's the interesting form of language that I'm interested in.

48:01.080 --> 48:07.640
 It's kind of a challenge I'm hoping to take on is I feel like some of the ideas that are

48:07.640 --> 48:11.480
 conveyed through language are actually can be put outside of language.

48:11.480 --> 48:17.680
 So one of the challenges I have to do is to have a conversation with people in Russian,

48:17.680 --> 48:22.560
 but for an English audience, and not rely purely on translators, there would of course

48:22.560 --> 48:28.920
 be translators there that help me dance through this mess of language.

48:28.920 --> 48:36.080
 But also, like my goal, my hope is to dance from Russian to English back and forth for

48:36.080 --> 48:39.000
 an English speaking audience and for a Russian speaking audience.

48:39.000 --> 48:44.200
 So not this pure, this is Russian, it's going to be translated to English, or this is English,

48:44.200 --> 48:49.400
 it's going to be translated to Russian, but dance back and forth and try to share with

48:49.400 --> 48:54.680
 people who don't speak one of the languages, the music that they're missing and sort of

48:54.680 --> 48:59.440
 almost hear that music because if you're sitting in another room and you hear the music through

48:59.440 --> 49:01.640
 the wall, I get a sense of it.

49:01.640 --> 49:07.560
 I think that would be a waste if I don't try to pursue this being a bilingual human

49:07.560 --> 49:08.560
 being.

49:08.560 --> 49:14.760
 And I wonder whether it's possible to capture some of the magic of the ideas in a way that

49:14.760 --> 49:18.880
 can be conveyed to people who don't speak that particular language.

49:18.880 --> 49:20.880
 I think it's a super exciting project.

49:20.880 --> 49:23.200
 I look forward to following it.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.640
 I'll tell you one thing that does happen.

49:25.640 --> 49:29.880
 So we read Dostoevsky in translation, occasionally I do have Russian speakers in the room, which

49:29.880 --> 49:37.760
 is super helpful, but I also encourage my students to, you know, some of them will have

49:37.760 --> 49:39.440
 different translations than others.

49:39.440 --> 49:45.840
 And that can be really helpful for the non native speaker because by paying attention

49:45.840 --> 49:52.480
 to the places where translators diverge in their translations of a given word or a phrase

49:52.480 --> 49:57.440
 or something like that, you can start to get the idea that somehow the words that we have

49:57.440 --> 50:02.880
 in English, they don't have the same contours as the word in Russian that's being translated.

50:02.880 --> 50:07.320
 And then you can start to ask about what those differences are.

50:07.320 --> 50:11.200
 And I think there's a kind of magic to it.

50:11.200 --> 50:17.640
 I mean, it's astonishing how rich and affecting these languages can be for people who really,

50:17.640 --> 50:20.440
 who grew up in them especially, who speak them as natives.

50:20.440 --> 50:26.120
 And that's a really powerful thing that actually doesn't exist enough of is, for example, for

50:26.120 --> 50:33.760
 Dostoevsky, most novels have been translated by two or three famous translators.

50:33.760 --> 50:37.520
 And there's a lot of discussions about who did it better and so on.

50:37.520 --> 50:43.320
 But I would love to, I'm a computer science person, I would love to do a diff where you

50:43.320 --> 50:48.040
 automatically detect all the differences in the translation just as you're saying and

50:48.040 --> 50:55.720
 use that, like somebody needs to publish literally just books describing the differences.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.920
 In fact, I'll probably do a little bit of this.

50:57.920 --> 51:04.120
 I heard the individual translators and interviews and blog posts and articles discuss particular

51:04.120 --> 51:08.400
 phrases that they differ on, but like to do that for an entire book.

51:08.400 --> 51:10.640
 That's a fascinating exploration.

51:10.640 --> 51:15.440
 As an English speaker, just read the differences in the translations.

51:15.440 --> 51:23.760
 You probably can get some deep understanding of ideas in those books by seeing the struggle

51:23.760 --> 51:26.360
 of the translators to capture that idea.

51:26.360 --> 51:28.160
 That's a really interesting idea.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.160
 Absolutely.

51:29.160 --> 51:32.480
 And you can do that for other projects and other languages too.

51:32.480 --> 51:38.080
 I mean, one of the, I don't know, I have this weird huge range of interests and some

51:38.080 --> 51:40.960
 days I'll find myself reading about something.

51:40.960 --> 51:45.800
 At one point I was interested in 14th century German mysticism.

51:45.800 --> 51:46.800
 Okay.

51:46.800 --> 51:50.760
 It turns out there's somebody who's written like volumes and volumes about this.

51:50.760 --> 51:51.920
 He's fantastic.

51:51.920 --> 51:55.520
 And I was interested in reading Meister Eckhart.

51:55.520 --> 51:58.680
 I wanted to know what was interesting about him.

51:58.680 --> 52:04.560
 And the sort of move that this guy Bernard McGinn, who's the great scholar of this period

52:04.560 --> 52:11.840
 made was to say, what Eckhart did, and everybody knows this, he translated Christianity into

52:11.840 --> 52:12.840
 the vernacular.

52:12.840 --> 52:17.120
 He started giving sermons in German to the peasants, sermons used to be in Latin and

52:17.120 --> 52:18.120
 nobody could speak Latin.

52:18.120 --> 52:22.480
 Can you imagine sitting there for a two hour sermon in a language that you don't know?

52:22.480 --> 52:27.920
 So he translated it into German, but in doing it, the resources of the German language are

52:27.920 --> 52:30.360
 different from the resources of the Latin language.

52:30.360 --> 52:38.240
 And there's a word in Middle High German, Grund, which we translated as ground.

52:38.240 --> 52:41.640
 And it's got this earthy feel to it.

52:41.640 --> 52:46.800
 It sort of invokes the notion of soil and what you stand on and what things grow out

52:46.800 --> 52:52.960
 of and sort of what you could run your fingers through that would have a kind of honesty

52:52.960 --> 52:54.680
 to it.

52:54.680 --> 52:57.240
 And there's no Latin word for that.

52:57.240 --> 53:02.640
 But in Eckhart's interpretation of Christianity, Grund, that's like the fundamental thing.

53:02.640 --> 53:07.280
 You don't understand God until you understand the way in which he is our ground.

53:07.280 --> 53:14.200
 And all of a sudden, this mysticism gets a kind of German cant that makes sense to the

53:14.200 --> 53:21.400
 people who speak German and that reveals something totally different about what you could think

53:21.400 --> 53:25.640
 that form of existence was that was covered over by the fact that it had always been done

53:25.640 --> 53:27.680
 in Latin.

53:27.680 --> 53:29.600
 Yeah, that's fascinating.

53:29.600 --> 53:36.360
 So okay, we talked about Dostoyevsky and the use of murder to explore human nature.

53:36.360 --> 53:42.280
 Let's go to Camus, who is maybe less concerned with murder, more concerned with suicide as

53:42.280 --> 53:44.240
 a way to explore human nature.

53:44.240 --> 53:52.840
 So he is probably my favorite existentialist, probably one of the more accessible existentialists.

53:52.840 --> 53:58.720
 And like you said, one of the people who didn't like to call himself an existentialist.

53:58.720 --> 54:01.080
 So what are your thoughts about Camus?

54:01.080 --> 54:03.920
 What role does he play in the story of existentialism?

54:03.920 --> 54:07.320
 So I find Camus totally fascinating, I really do.

54:07.320 --> 54:14.200
 And for years, I didn't teach Camus because the famous thing that you're referring to,

54:14.200 --> 54:20.000
 the myth of Sisyphus, which is a sort of essay, it's published as a book, super accessible,

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
 really fascinating.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.960
 He's a great writer, really engaging.

54:23.960 --> 54:31.640
 The opening line is something like, there is but one truly significant philosophical question,

54:31.640 --> 54:34.120
 and that is the question of suicide.

54:34.120 --> 54:40.920
 And I thought, I can't teach my 18 year olds a, you know, like how, I just thought that's

54:40.920 --> 54:41.920
 terrible.

54:41.920 --> 54:46.480
 Like how can I, I mean, it's not wrong, like that's a, but do I want to bring that into

54:46.480 --> 54:47.880
 the classroom?

54:47.880 --> 54:53.440
 And so I read it, I read the essay, I avoided it for a long time because just because of

54:53.440 --> 54:54.920
 that line.

54:54.920 --> 54:57.960
 And I thought, I'm not going to be able to make sense of this in a way that will be

54:57.960 --> 54:59.840
 helpful for anyone.

54:59.840 --> 55:03.760
 But finally, one year, maybe seven or eight years ago, I sat down to read it.

55:03.760 --> 55:07.040
 I thought, I've got to really confront it.

55:07.040 --> 55:10.520
 And I read it and it's incredibly engaging.

55:10.520 --> 55:15.280
 I mean, it's really, really beautiful and Camus was against suicide, which just turns

55:15.280 --> 55:16.280
 out to be good.

55:16.280 --> 55:19.320
 You know, I was happy about that.

55:19.320 --> 55:26.320
 But he has a bit of a bleak understanding of what human existence amounts to.

55:26.320 --> 55:32.560
 And so in the end, he thinks that human existence is absurd.

55:32.560 --> 55:36.720
 And it's being absurd as a kind of technical term for him.

55:36.720 --> 55:45.720
 And it means that the episodes in your life and your life as a whole presents itself to

55:45.720 --> 55:51.320
 you as if it's got a meaning, but really it doesn't.

55:51.320 --> 55:59.800
 So there's this tension between the way things seem to be on their surface and what really

55:59.800 --> 56:03.040
 turns out to be true about them.

56:03.040 --> 56:05.600
 And he gives these great examples.

56:05.600 --> 56:06.800
 You probably remember these.

56:06.800 --> 56:13.120
 He says, there you are, you're walking along the street and there's a plate glass window

56:13.120 --> 56:18.400
 and a building and through the window, you see somebody talking on a cell phone.

56:18.400 --> 56:23.520
 I mean, I imagine it as a cell phone, but Camus for didn't.

56:23.520 --> 56:26.720
 But you see somebody talking on a cell phone and he's animated.

56:26.720 --> 56:31.840
 He's talking a lot as if things really meant something.

56:31.840 --> 56:36.660
 And yet Camus says, it's a dumb show.

56:36.660 --> 56:39.360
 And it's not dumb in the sense, just in the sense that it's stupid.

56:39.360 --> 56:41.880
 It's dumb in the sense that it's silent.

56:41.880 --> 56:47.400
 It presents itself as if it's got some significance and yet its significance is withheld from you.

56:47.400 --> 56:50.120
 And he says, that's what our lives are like.

56:50.120 --> 56:54.360
 Everything in our lives presents themselves to us as if it's got a significance, but it

56:54.360 --> 56:55.360
 doesn't.

56:55.360 --> 56:56.860
 It's absurd.

56:56.860 --> 57:01.960
 And then he says, really what our lives are like, they're like the lives of Sisyphus.

57:01.960 --> 57:07.400
 Just day after day, you do the same thing.

57:07.400 --> 57:11.800
 You wake up at a certain time, you get on the bus, you go to work, you take your lunch

57:11.800 --> 57:13.800
 break, you get off.

57:13.800 --> 57:19.480
 I have a colleague who once said to me something like this, it was about October or so in the

57:19.480 --> 57:20.480
 fall semester.

57:20.480 --> 57:22.680
 I said, how's it going, Dick?

57:22.680 --> 57:24.040
 He said, well, you know how it is.

57:24.040 --> 57:30.000
 I got on the conveyor belt at the beginning of the semester and I'm just going through.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.200
 And that's the way my life is.

57:32.200 --> 57:38.960
 And Camus thinks that experience, which you can sometimes have, reveals something true

57:38.960 --> 57:41.360
 about what human lives are like.

57:41.360 --> 57:46.400
 Our lives really just are like the life of Sisyphus who rolls this boulder up the hill

57:46.400 --> 57:48.200
 from morning till night.

57:48.200 --> 57:53.080
 And then at night, he gets to the top and it rolls back down to the bottom.

57:53.080 --> 57:57.580
 Over the course of the night, he walks back down and then he starts it all over again.

57:57.580 --> 58:00.520
 And he says, Sisyphus is condemned to this life.

58:00.520 --> 58:07.360
 Like we're condemned to our lives, but we do have one bit of freedom and it's the only

58:07.360 --> 58:10.440
 thing that we can hang on to.

58:10.440 --> 58:18.120
 It's the freedom to stick it to the gods who put us in this position by embracing this

58:18.120 --> 58:21.440
 existence rather than giving up and committing suicide.

58:21.440 --> 58:30.280
 And I thought, well, it's kind of a happy ending, but I also thought it's a dim view

58:30.280 --> 58:33.240
 of what our existence amounts to.

58:33.240 --> 58:40.080
 So I think there's something fascinating about that, but what I came to believe and

58:40.080 --> 58:41.560
 I tried to write about this once.

58:41.560 --> 58:45.920
 I know you read the thing about a liveness that I published once.

58:45.920 --> 58:48.000
 That's secretly a criticism of Camus.

58:48.000 --> 58:53.600
 I don't think I mentioned Camus in there, but I think Camus has got the phenomenon wrong

58:53.600 --> 58:59.360
 or he's missed some important aspect of it because in Camus view, when you experience

58:59.360 --> 59:04.440
 your day as sort of going on in this deadening way and you're just doing the things that

59:04.440 --> 59:07.520
 you always do, the way you always do them.

59:07.520 --> 59:13.360
 For Camus, that reveals the truth about what our lives are, but I think there's some aspect,

59:13.360 --> 59:19.120
 at least for me, and maybe he just didn't feel this or didn't have access to it.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.440
 Maybe others don't.

59:20.440 --> 59:25.600
 But for me, there's an extra part to it, which is somehow that, yes, that's the way things

59:25.600 --> 59:30.560
 are and it's inadequate.

59:30.560 --> 59:38.080
 And there's something that's missing from that aspect of our existence that could be there

59:38.080 --> 59:43.160
 and it feels like our lives are not about just putting up with that and sticking it

59:43.160 --> 59:50.880
 to the gods by embracing it, but seeking that absence part of it, the part that's recognizable

59:50.880 --> 59:54.680
 in its absence in your experience of that.

59:54.680 --> 1:00:02.080
 And that's what I think we do have the experience of the presence of that in moments when you

1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:04.400
 feel truly alive.

1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:08.920
 And that's what you mean by the word aliveness, which is a fascinating and a powerful word.

1:00:08.920 --> 1:00:10.600
 Yeah, that's what I mean by it.

1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:17.360
 I think most people can recognize moments in their lives when they really felt alive

1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:23.600
 and it could happen in a moment when, I don't know, maybe Miles Davis felt it in that moment

1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:29.120
 when he was responding to Herbie Hancock's chord, or maybe you feel it in that moment

1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:34.920
 where you grab for the hand on the first date and the gesture is reciprocated, or maybe

1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:41.840
 you feel it in some moment when you are doing a kind of peak athletic thing or watching

1:00:41.840 --> 1:00:45.480
 somebody else do a peak athletic thing.

1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:52.240
 But I think there are moments when it feels like it's not like the way Camu is describing

1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:56.480
 things and it's better because of that.

1:00:56.480 --> 1:01:04.600
 So I think one really powerful way for me to understand aliveness is to think about going

1:01:04.600 --> 1:01:09.360
 to a darker territory, is to think about suicide and I've known people in my life who suffer

1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:12.880
 from clinical depression.

1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:20.760
 And you know, whatever the chemistry is in our brain, there is a certain kind of feeling

1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:23.240
 that is to be depressed.

1:01:23.240 --> 1:01:30.160
 Where you look in the mirror and ask, do I want to kill myself today?

1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:36.840
 This is the question that Camu asks, this question, this philosophical question.

1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:44.920
 And there is people who, when they're depressed, say, not only do they say, I want to kill

1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:49.320
 myself or I don't, they say, it doesn't matter.

1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:54.680
 And that's chemistry, that's whatever that is, that's chemistry in our mind.

1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:59.560
 And then on the flip side of that, for me, I've had some low points, but I've been very

1:01:59.560 --> 1:02:03.880
 fortunate to not suffer from that kind of depression.

1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:11.560
 I am the opposite, which is not only moments of peak performance in athletics or great

1:02:11.560 --> 1:02:18.480
 music or any of that, I'm just deeply joyful often by mundane things.

1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:22.920
 Like, as you were saying it, I was drinking this thing and it's cold and for some reason,

1:02:22.920 --> 1:02:28.920
 the coldness of that was like, oh, great, like refrigeration, I don't know, there was

1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:32.840
 a joy in that, like, I can't put it into words, but it just felt great.

1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:37.960
 And then just so many things, you look out in nature, there's a nice breeze and just

1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:40.160
 like, it's amazing.

1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:46.520
 So that doesn't feel like I'm embracing the absurd.

1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:51.720
 That seems like I'm getting some nice like dopamine hits in whatever the chemistry is

1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:58.080
 from just the basics of life and that is the source of aliveness, however my brain is built,

1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:05.520
 it's gotten a natural sort of mechanism for aliveness.

1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:11.960
 And so the one nice way to see the absence of aliveness is to look at the chemical, the

1:03:11.960 --> 1:03:14.240
 clinical depression.

1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:20.200
 And so Camus doesn't seem to contend with that at all and asking the question of suicide

1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:24.480
 because when you look in the mirror and ask, like, if I ask myself, do I want to kill myself

1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:25.480
 today?

1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:29.920
 I ask that question in a different way, more like a stoic way often, like basically every

1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:33.240
 day is, you know, what if I die today?

1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:37.240
 It's more like contemplating your mortality every single day.

1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:44.880
 You know, that excites me, the possibility that this is my last day that, you know, it

1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:48.560
 just reminds me how amazing life is and that's chemistry.

1:03:48.560 --> 1:03:56.240
 I don't know what that is, but that's certainly not some kind of philosophical decision I

1:03:56.240 --> 1:03:57.240
 made.

1:03:57.240 --> 1:04:04.320
 I am a little bit riding a wave of the chemistry of the genetics I've been given of the dopamine.

1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:10.760
 So that question of suicide, by the way, do you find that formulation of the question

1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:14.560
 of existentialism?

1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:18.760
 I know you didn't want to teach it because obviously, suicide is a very difficult word,

1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:20.640
 especially for young minds.

1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:25.360
 But do you think that's a useful formulation of the question of existentialism?

1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:29.320
 Like him saying, this is the most important question of suicide?

1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:31.520
 I think there is something to it.

1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:38.080
 If you read the question as the question, what is it in virtue of which it ought to be

1:04:38.080 --> 1:04:43.400
 desirable to live the lives that we're capable of living?

1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:44.400
 That's a deep question.

1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:45.400
 Yeah.

1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:50.760
 That's a question that gets focused when someone asks themselves whether they ought to continue

1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:57.720
 to live that life, with the famous line, nothing focuses the mind more than one's impending

1:04:57.720 --> 1:04:58.720
 execution.

1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:06.560
 I mean, I think there's something important about that, that recognizing the riskiness

1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:13.800
 and the vulnerability of one's existence is super important.

1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:20.800
 And I think that if we didn't have that, our lives wouldn't be capable of being meaningful.

1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:25.280
 If they weren't risky and vulnerable, there would be nothing to lose.

1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:28.880
 And it's only because there are things to lose that they can come to have the significance

1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:29.880
 that they do.

1:05:29.880 --> 1:05:34.320
 So yeah, I think I'm not against the idea that that's a deep way of approaching the

1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:38.120
 questions at the core of existentialism.

1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:42.880
 But as you say, I was worried for a while about how I was going to teach it.

1:05:42.880 --> 1:05:48.720
 Well, I think there's a difference between suicide and not living because suicide is an

1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:50.600
 action.

1:05:50.600 --> 1:06:00.720
 So it feels like to me, suicide doesn't make sense because imagine you're in a hotel and

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:04.920
 you're saying, the room I'm in sucks, but there's other rooms.

1:06:04.920 --> 1:06:08.160
 So maybe explore those other rooms.

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:13.200
 Maybe you'll find meaning in those other rooms.

1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:19.560
 Basically embracing the fact that you don't know everything and you need time to explore

1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:20.560
 everything.

1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:25.640
 But once you've explored everything, then maybe you can make a full decision.

1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:30.800
 But it's unfair to make a decision.

1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:36.560
 I would say unethical to make a decision until you've explored all the rooms in the hotel.

1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:37.560
 Yeah.

1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:40.560
 And this gets focused in the brothers Karamazov, of course.

1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:47.480
 There's one brother who is really asking that question, is asking the question of suicide.

1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:53.200
 He's asking the question whether the world that we live in is a world that's worth living

1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:54.760
 in.

1:06:54.760 --> 1:06:59.680
 And I think that character is, as you say, very ill.

1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:08.440
 And it's possible, and often because, as you say, of brain chemistry, physiologies.

1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:15.480
 There's certainly a physical ground to that situation, to that condition.

1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:20.440
 But I think it is possible for someone to be in that situation.

1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:28.800
 I think that Ivan Karamazov, who's the character who's asking this question, is maybe, let's

1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:31.160
 say, chemically depressed or something like that.

1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:33.600
 But I think there's more to it too.

1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:39.160
 And I think that Dostoevsky's real view is that the brain chemistry doesn't exist on

1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:40.360
 its own.

1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:45.760
 The way we interact with one another, the way we care about or isolate ourselves from

1:07:45.760 --> 1:07:54.960
 others, the way we care for the lives that we lead, affects the chemistry of our brain,

1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:57.720
 which goes on and changes the mood that we're in.

1:07:57.720 --> 1:08:06.760
 So I think Dostoevsky does think that Ivan's salvation, if he's capable of being saved,

1:08:06.760 --> 1:08:10.000
 is going to come through the love of his brother Alyosha.

1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:13.200
 Let me spring maybe a bit of a tangent on you.

1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:19.480
 Do you ever, one of my other favorite authors is Herman Hesse, do you ever include him in

1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:24.600
 our deck of sport cards that represent existentialism?

1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:25.600
 I haven't.

1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:26.600
 Maybe I should.

1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:27.600
 What should I read?

1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:28.600
 What should I think about including?

1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:35.360
 No, there's some kind of embrace of absurdism.

1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:42.680
 There's a existentialist ideal pervading most of his work.

1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:49.720
 But there's more of, like with Siddhartha, there's more, almost like a Buddhist sort

1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:58.160
 of like watch the river and become the river, this kind of idea that what it means to truly

1:08:58.160 --> 1:08:59.760
 experience the moment.

1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:05.520
 So there is an experiential part of existentialism where you want to, it's not just about, we've

1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:10.200
 been talking about kind of decisions and actions, but also what it means to listen,

1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:15.760
 like you said from Nietzsche, like what it means to really take in the world and experience

1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:16.760
 the moment.

1:09:16.760 --> 1:09:20.920
 So he's very good at writing about what it means to experience the moment and experience

1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:23.240
 the full absurdity of the moment.

1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:31.760
 And for him, I'm starting to forget, Steppenwolf I think is humor is part of the absurdity,

1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:37.920
 which I think modern day internet explores very well with memes and so on.

1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:45.600
 Humor is a fundamental part of the existentialist ethic that's able to deal with absurdity.

1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:48.120
 You got to like laugh at it.

1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:51.960
 I think there is some, let me just say something about humor because I think you're absolutely

1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:52.960
 right.

1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:59.560
 I mean, regard who is Danish and most people think deeply depressed and then so on is actually

1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:05.080
 an incredibly funny writer and someone who was a classmate of mine in graduate school

1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:10.880
 who left philosophy to become a Hollywood comedy writer, he's a very successful guy

1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:16.880
 and then he came back 25 years later and wrote, finished his dissertation and I was the reader

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:22.200
 on the dissertation, there may be a conflict of interest, I'm not quite sure.

1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:27.440
 But his dissertation was about, he called it Kierkegaard and the funny, which is a kind

1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:29.080
 of a funny title.

1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:36.240
 But Kierkegaard, according to Eric Kaplan's reading, Kierkegaard does have this idea that

1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:46.480
 there's something destabilizing about humor that's crucial to the sort of the important

1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:48.800
 possibilities for us.

1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:55.240
 So there's the idea that like there's a moment when a joke is being set up, when you're sort

1:10:55.240 --> 1:11:02.280
 of proceeding as if you're on stable ground and then the punch line comes and the rug

1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:09.040
 is pulled out from under you and for a moment, it's like you're falling, there's nothing

1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:16.120
 supporting you until you're captured by your totally new understanding of what was going

1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:23.800
 on and that humor necessarily has that kind of destabilizing feature to it.

1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:28.760
 And that's like the riskiness, that's like the riskiness that you were pointing to.

1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:33.800
 If there aren't risks in your life, if your life is totally safe, then there's no possibility

1:11:33.800 --> 1:11:35.360
 of significance.

1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:41.400
 And so I think on Eric's reading, Kierkegaard sort of wants to line up the importance of

1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:47.440
 the riskiness and vulnerability in your life to its having meaning with the experience

1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:55.280
 of destabilization that you get in jokes and comedy, which then becomes significant, right?

1:11:55.280 --> 1:11:59.360
 When you remember having heard a joke for the first time, it's got a kind of salience

1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:00.760
 for you.

1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:06.000
 Speaking of jokes and speaking of, you mentioned film and literature.

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:14.840
 So existentialism in film and literature, I think for a lot of people, especially nihilism,

1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:19.520
 was experienced in the great work of art, modern work of art called Big Lebowski.

1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:26.120
 I don't know if you've ever seen that film, but there's a group of nihilists in that film.

1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:27.960
 They're just like, they don't care about anything.

1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:31.360
 I think they happen to be German, at least they have German accents.

1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:38.680
 So maybe can you talk about notable appearances of existentialism in film?

1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:45.200
 And if you at all ever bring up Big Lebowski, if that ever comes into play.

1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:48.840
 So I know that people think about the Big Lebowski in this context.

1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:51.800
 And I did actually rewatch it not so long ago.

1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:52.800
 We have kids.

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.520
 I thought maybe it's time, just wasn't really time for the 11 year old.

1:12:58.520 --> 1:12:59.760
 So somewhat inappropriate.

1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:01.840
 But I have never taught that film.

1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:02.920
 So I'd have to think more.

1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:03.920
 We could talk about it.

1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:06.480
 I'd be happy to try to think on the fly about it.

1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:07.480
 Okay.

1:13:07.480 --> 1:13:12.440
 So I would love to because there is a, feels like there's a philosophical depth to that

1:13:12.440 --> 1:13:13.440
 film.

1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:17.880
 So there's a person that just the main character.

1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:19.040
 The Jeff Bridges character.

1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:20.040
 Jeff Bridges character.

1:13:20.040 --> 1:13:21.040
 Yeah.

1:13:21.040 --> 1:13:26.320
 He kind of, he drinks like these white Russians and he just kind of walks around in a very

1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:37.040
 relaxed way and irradiates both a love for life, but also just an acceptance of like,

1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:41.160
 it is what it is kind of philosophy.

1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:49.040
 And then there's a bunch of characters that have very busy lives, trying to do some big

1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:54.360
 projects that are dramatic in some way, make some huge amounts of money.

1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:58.880
 So it kind of actually reminds me of the idiot by the SDSK in a certain kind of sense.

1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:05.120
 And then there's these players, I mean, they're phrased as nihilists, but they kind of don't

1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:07.080
 care to enjoy life.

1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:09.400
 They want to mess with life in some kind of way.

1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:18.480
 And of course there's interesting personalities that, what is it, Jesus, the bowler.

1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:26.600
 And then there's like Donnie, who is a bit clueless, and then there's the John Goodman

1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:32.280
 character that's talking about Vietnam and just takes life way too seriously, too intensely

1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:33.280
 and so on.

1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:38.440
 So it just paints a full sort of spectrum of characters that are operating in this world.

1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:45.360
 And perhaps most importantly for existentialism are thrown into absurdity and hence the humor.

1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:46.360
 Okay.

1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:47.360
 All right, good.

1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:48.360
 Well, that's helpful.

1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:49.560
 It's just reminding me of all that.

1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:55.280
 And I think, so one thing to say is that the nihilists, the group of nihilists who call

1:14:55.280 --> 1:15:01.280
 themselves nihilists, I think they've got a bad misinterpretation of what nihilism

1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:03.600
 is supposed to be.

1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:07.480
 And this happened actually in the 20s.

1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:14.520
 There was a famous case of a couple of German students, Leopold and Loeb, who'd read a lot

1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:16.240
 of Nietzsche.

1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:24.880
 Nietzsche was a kind of hero for the Nazis even, I think based on a pretty bad misunderstanding

1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:26.360
 of what he was up to.

1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:31.680
 But Leopold and Loeb had the bad understanding first and they were students, they'd read

1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:35.160
 a lot of Nietzsche and they thought, okay, nothing means anything.

1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:42.240
 The only way that there's any significance in life is through our will to sort of powerfully

1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.440
 bring something about.

1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:50.920
 And if we're going to do that in a way that reflects the fact that nothing means anything,

1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:56.200
 then what we should do is take these things, these actions that people always thought were

1:15:56.200 --> 1:16:02.760
 bad and do them and show that there's nothing wrong with doing them.

1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:05.760
 And so they decided they would murder someone.

1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:08.880
 Not because they were angry at them, just someone they'd never met.

1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:10.920
 It was important that it was someone they'd never met.

1:16:10.920 --> 1:16:17.920
 It was totally unmotivated act and they thought, we'll embrace nihilism by showing that we

1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:26.560
 can act in such a way as to do something that morality thinks is bad and through our will

1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:31.440
 bring it about that we desire to do it for no reason that has anything to do with its

1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:34.680
 potentially being interpretable as good.

1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:40.440
 And I think that's a terrible misreading of what Nietzsche thinks the response to nihilism

1:16:40.440 --> 1:16:41.440
 is.

1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:47.400
 I mean, I think read that against the Miles Davis thing, Miles Davis's aim is to creatively

1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:53.040
 bring it about that something works well in a situation where he is kind of constrained.

1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:58.360
 So they thought two things, one, there are no constraints at all, not even the constraints

1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:01.080
 of the situation that we find ourselves in.

1:17:01.080 --> 1:17:08.400
 And two, we only become the beings that we really are when we act against what you might

1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:10.480
 have thought the constraints were.

1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:14.080
 And I just think that's a bad misreading of what that kind of nihilism is up to.

1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:20.400
 And I think maybe that group in the Big Lebowski has got that kind of bad misreading.

1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:23.360
 But then the major characters are much more interesting.

1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:24.640
 Go ahead, you're going to say something.

1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:28.960
 So there's some kind of apathy to that, their particular nihilism.

1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:36.640
 Could you comment on whether you see sort of apathy as a philosophy part of that nihilism?

1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:45.520
 Sort of like, from an existentialist perspective, how important is it to care about stuff?

1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:48.920
 Like really take on life.

1:17:48.920 --> 1:17:56.280
 What does existentialism have to say about just sitting back and just not caring?

1:17:56.280 --> 1:17:57.440
 Excellent.

1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:01.880
 So apathy is like a really important word.

1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:05.320
 The Greek word is apathē, it means without passions.

1:18:05.320 --> 1:18:10.760
 And the Stoics, who you mentioned earlier, really thought that passions are what get

1:18:10.760 --> 1:18:14.280
 in the way if you're living well.

1:18:14.280 --> 1:18:17.760
 Because to live well, you have to think clearly about what you should do.

1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:23.520
 And you shouldn't let your resentments and your angers and your petty animosities direct

1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:24.640
 your behavior.

1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:28.600
 You should release yourself from those kinds of passions.

1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:31.880
 So Stoicism, again, huge caricature.

1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:37.320
 But you know, it's an aim not to care, because caring is bad.

1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:44.800
 And there's certain forms of existentialism, certainly in Pascal and Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky

1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:49.560
 and Heidegger, and Sart in his own way.

1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:52.280
 So it's not just a theistic or atheistic thing.

1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:57.760
 Where what's crucial about us is that we do care.

1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:02.440
 Care says, care is the being of Dasein, Dasein is his name for us.

1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:06.800
 What it is to be us is to be the being that already cares.

1:19:06.800 --> 1:19:09.080
 And you can't not do that.

1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:13.480
 You can pretend you're not doing it, but you're just caring in a different way.

1:19:13.480 --> 1:19:19.800
 It's like Sart saying, you can pretend you're not taking responsibility, or you could pretend

1:19:19.800 --> 1:19:23.560
 that you don't have to make a decision, that is making a decision.

1:19:23.560 --> 1:19:25.760
 Not caring is a way of caring.

1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:31.440
 And so I think the existentialists that I'm interested in think that we do care.

1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:34.840
 That's constitutive of what it is to be us.

1:19:34.840 --> 1:19:41.000
 And so they'll think that the Stoics got it wrong, but that leaves open a huge range

1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:49.840
 of moves about how we inhabit that existence well.

1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:53.600
 Let me ask about Ayn Rand.

1:19:53.600 --> 1:20:01.160
 So it just so happens that she's entered a few conversations in this podcast.

1:20:01.160 --> 1:20:06.320
 And just looking at academic philosophy or just philosophers in general, they seem to

1:20:06.320 --> 1:20:07.320
 ignore Ayn Rand.

1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:10.040
 Do you have a sense of why that is?

1:20:10.040 --> 1:20:16.400
 Does she ever come into play her ideas of objectivism, come into play of discussions

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:26.360
 of a good life from the perspective of existentialism in how you teach it and how you think about

1:20:26.360 --> 1:20:27.360
 it?

1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:30.960
 Is she somebody who you find it all interesting?

1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:36.360
 So no, I don't think she is, but it's been a long time since I've read her stuff.

1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:37.600
 I read it in high school.

1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:41.640
 I read The Fountainhead in high school and Atlas Shrugged, but that's at this point a

1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:42.640
 very long time ago.

1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:46.880
 I think I read something about objective epistemology or something too.

1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:53.880
 So my view about her could be based on a total misunderstanding of what she's up to.

1:20:53.880 --> 1:21:04.080
 But my caricature of her and tell me if I've got it wrong is that she's sort of motivated

1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:11.280
 by a kind of, I think it's maybe sometimes you call it libertarianism, but maybe let's

1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:16.600
 in the context of our discussion, tie it back to Sartre, a kind of view according to

1:21:16.600 --> 1:21:21.960
 which we're the being who has to contend with the fact that we're radically free to do stuff

1:21:21.960 --> 1:21:27.720
 and we're just not being courageous or brave enough when we don't do that and the people

1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:33.080
 to admire are the people who make stuff out of nothing.

1:21:33.080 --> 1:21:34.760
 So maybe that's a bad caricature.

1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:35.760
 No, no, no.

1:21:35.760 --> 1:21:38.120
 I think, no, I think that's pretty accurate.

1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:43.840
 I'm not, again, very knowledgeable about the full depth of her philosophy, but I think

1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:53.680
 she takes a view of the world that's similar to Sartre in the conclusions, but makes stronger

1:21:53.680 --> 1:22:00.160
 statements about epistemology that first of all, everything is knowable and there's some,

1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:03.120
 you should always operate through reason.

1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:05.600
 Like reason is very important.

1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:13.400
 Like it's like, you start with a few axioms and you build on top of that and the axioms

1:22:13.400 --> 1:22:21.640
 that everybody should operate on are the same, again, reality is objective, it's not subjective.

1:22:21.640 --> 1:22:27.240
 So from that, you can derive the entirety of how humans should behave at the individual

1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:33.280
 level and at the societal level and there's a few conclusions, she would talk about virtue

1:22:33.280 --> 1:22:38.240
 of selfishness and a lot of people use that to dismiss her look, she's very selfish and

1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:39.240
 so on.

1:22:39.240 --> 1:22:45.400
 She actually meant something very different, it's more like the Sartre thing, take responsibility

1:22:45.400 --> 1:22:52.400
 for yourself, understand what forces you're operating under and make the best of this

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:58.720
 life and that's how you can be the best member of societies by making the best life you can

1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:05.160
 and just focus on yourself, fix your own problems first and that will make you the best member

1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:10.680
 of society, of your family, of loved ones, of friends and so on.

1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:16.560
 I think the reason she's disliked, obviously on the philosophy side she's disliked because

1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:22.040
 a little bit like Nietzsche, she's like, she's literary.

1:23:22.040 --> 1:23:28.920
 I think the reason she's publicly disliked in public conversations is because of how

1:23:28.920 --> 1:23:34.800
 sure she is of herself, which is some of the philosophy has been known to do, make very

1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:39.480
 strong statements like hell is other people, but she was making very strong statements

1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:50.880
 about basically everything but the reason I bring her up is she is an influential thinker

1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:56.360
 that is not for some reason often brought up as such, it's not acknowledged how influential

1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:57.360
 she is.

1:23:57.360 --> 1:24:05.640
 I was recently looking at a list of the most important women of the 20th century in terms

1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:13.440
 of thought, not science, but thought and she wasn't in that list and I see this time and

1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:21.120
 time again and it doesn't make sense to me why she's so dismissed because clearly she's

1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:29.840
 an author of some of the most read books ever and she clearly had very strong ideas that

1:24:29.840 --> 1:24:34.440
 should be contended with.

1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:40.440
 That's why it didn't make sense to me because she's also a creature of her time and an important

1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:45.680
 woman, she's a creation of the Soviet Union, somebody who left because of that and so some

1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:53.440
 of the strength of her ideas has to do with how much she dislikes that particular philosophy

1:24:53.440 --> 1:25:01.480
 and way of life, but also she's a creature of like Sartre and that whole Nietzsche and

1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:02.480
 so on.

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:07.960
 Now, one of the other criticisms is she doesn't integrate herself into this history.

1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:14.840
 She keeps basically kind of implying that she's purely original in all her thoughts even though

1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:20.160
 she's kind of citing a lot of other people, but again, many philosophers do this kind

1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:24.760
 of thing as if they are truly original and they're not.

1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:29.200
 It is interesting and also what's interesting about her is she is a woman, she is a strong

1:25:29.200 --> 1:25:36.680
 feminist and it feels like with Simone de Beauvoir, like it seems like she's a very

1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:42.680
 important person in this moment of history that shouldn't be fully forgotten.

1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:43.680
 Interesting.

1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:44.680
 Yeah.

1:25:44.680 --> 1:25:46.680
 Well, so I mean, I don't have a lot to add.

1:25:46.680 --> 1:25:49.680
 I will just say this.

1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:55.400
 I mean, the way she and Beauvoir seemed to me from your description of her and remembering

1:25:55.400 --> 1:26:02.480
 what I remember from 35 years ago, they seem pretty opposite from one another.

1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:08.020
 One of the things I find interesting about Beauvoir is that she takes seriously the thing

1:26:08.020 --> 1:26:16.960
 that Sartre didn't, which is our thrownness, which is the sense in which we're born into

1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:21.320
 a situation that's already got a significance for her.

1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:26.560
 I think it was easier for her to recognize that than Sartre because she was a woman and

1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:32.440
 Sartre seems to act as if there are no constraints or at least there shouldn't be.

1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:35.960
 They're pretty close as privileged white males.

1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:36.960
 Yeah, exactly.

1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:40.600
 If we could just get rid of the last bits of them, we would be God like we're supposed

1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:41.600
 to be.

1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:42.600
 Yeah.

1:26:42.600 --> 1:26:44.920
 And I think Beauvoir sort of sees things differently.

1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:50.120
 I think she reckons, one's not born but becomes a woman, she says.

1:26:50.120 --> 1:26:51.480
 So how does that happen?

1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:55.200
 Well, you're thrown into your culture and your culture starts treating you in a certain

1:26:55.200 --> 1:27:00.360
 way because of your gender and that starts to form your understanding and your experience

1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:01.360
 of things.

1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:07.840
 By the time you're grown up, well, you're pretty well formed by that.

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:08.840
 That seems a fact.

1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:14.600
 It's a fact about Sartre too, though it was harder for him to notice it because he was

1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:17.600
 formed into his privilege.

1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:21.920
 But the world reminds us of our thrownness for some more than others.

1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:23.560
 Yes, absolutely.

1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:31.680
 And for people who have to contend on a daily basis with the fact that the social position

1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:39.200
 they're thrown into is one that negates them or one that oppresses them or one that sort

1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:42.080
 of pushes them to the side in some way or another.

1:27:42.080 --> 1:27:46.440
 I mean, the black experience is interesting in this respect too.

1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:51.200
 Franz Fanon, who's a contemporary of Sartre and Beauvoir's, writes about it.

1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:57.000
 And it's very familiar the things that he's saying now, but he writes back in the 50s about

1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:05.160
 being a black man in Paris and getting on an elevator with a woman alone and how her

1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:11.680
 reaction to him, not knowing him, not having any views about any reason to have any views

1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:17.200
 about him sort of puts him in a particular social position with respect to her.

1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:25.360
 And if you don't have that experience, it's much harder to recognize the way in which

1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:29.360
 what we're thrown into is something we might not have chosen.

1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:37.800
 So the idea that that's not an aspect of our existence, which as you describe Ayn Rand's

1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:44.360
 views, she sounds more like Sartre, she sounds more like either it's not an aspect of our

1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:47.960
 existence or at least we ought to sort of aim at it's not being an aspect of our existence.

1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:49.520
 Yeah, almost act as if it's not.

1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:50.520
 Yeah, exactly.

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:51.520
 Act as if it's not.

1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:57.040
 And so I think from my point of view, I don't pretend that I'm explaining the public reception

1:28:57.040 --> 1:28:58.040
 of her.

1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:03.840
 I'm just sort of trying to say how I understand her in this intellectual context.

1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:07.680
 From my point of view, that's something big to miss.

1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:11.720
 And the ambition to think that really what's happening is that we're all the same.

1:29:11.720 --> 1:29:13.800
 We're all rational beings.

1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:19.080
 We're all beings who, if we just got the axioms of our existence right and made good judgments

1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:25.560
 and reasoned in an appropriate way, would optimize ourselves.

1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:33.440
 That feels to me like a kind of natural end point of the philosophical tradition.

1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:38.480
 I mean, sort of Plato starts off with a view that helps us in that direction and the enlightenment

1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:41.100
 moves us further in that direction.

1:29:41.100 --> 1:29:47.320
 And from my point of view, that movement has led us astray because it's missed something

1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:52.440
 really important that's crucial to the kind of being that we are.

1:29:52.440 --> 1:29:55.560
 Yeah, it misses the music.

1:29:55.560 --> 1:29:56.560
 Exactly.

1:29:56.560 --> 1:29:57.560
 It misses the music.

1:29:57.560 --> 1:30:03.040
 Let's talk about thrownness and I think you mentioned that in the context of Heidegger.

1:30:03.040 --> 1:30:05.040
 So can we talk about Heidegger?

1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:06.040
 Okay.

1:30:06.040 --> 1:30:12.200
 So what is this philosopher, what are some fascinating ideas that he brought to the world?

1:30:12.200 --> 1:30:13.200
 Okay.

1:30:13.200 --> 1:30:15.840
 So Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher.

1:30:15.840 --> 1:30:20.520
 I do know when he was born, 1889, but I don't know that only by accident.

1:30:20.520 --> 1:30:24.560
 It's because it's the same year that Wittgenstein and Austrian philosopher was born and the

1:30:24.560 --> 1:30:26.240
 same year that Hitler was born.

1:30:26.240 --> 1:30:31.640
 So if I've remembered my dates right and someone will call in and correct me otherwise.

1:30:31.640 --> 1:30:35.200
 But that's the way it sort of sits in my memory bank.

1:30:35.200 --> 1:30:39.400
 And it's interesting that the three of them were born at the same time.

1:30:39.400 --> 1:30:46.960
 Wittgenstein and Heidegger share some similarities, but then it's also interesting that Heidegger

1:30:46.960 --> 1:30:47.960
 was a Nazi.

1:30:47.960 --> 1:30:53.360
 I mean, this is a very disturbing fact about his personal political background.

1:30:53.360 --> 1:30:57.880
 And so it's something that anyone who thinks that things that he said might be interesting

1:30:57.880 --> 1:30:59.880
 has got a content with.

1:30:59.880 --> 1:31:06.840
 He was born in Germany, Hitler in Austria, Wittgenstein is Austria also.

1:31:06.840 --> 1:31:12.160
 But so you have to, when you call Heidegger a Nazi, you have to remember, I mean, there

1:31:12.160 --> 1:31:14.080
 was millions of Nazis too.

1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:19.480
 So like there are parts of their, that's the history of the world.

1:31:19.480 --> 1:31:26.720
 There's a lot of communists, Marxists and Nazis in that part of history.

1:31:26.720 --> 1:31:27.720
 Absolutely.

1:31:27.720 --> 1:31:32.880
 And one of the discussion points is, well, was he just a kind of social Nazi?

1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:39.160
 I mean, he went to parties with them and stuff, or was he like, did he really believe in the

1:31:39.160 --> 1:31:40.160
 ideology?

1:31:40.160 --> 1:31:42.560
 And that's a choice point.

1:31:42.560 --> 1:31:44.920
 And we could talk about it if you want.

1:31:44.920 --> 1:31:46.840
 He held a political position.

1:31:46.840 --> 1:31:49.940
 That's one of the relevant parts in 1933.

1:31:49.940 --> 1:31:52.800
 He was made rector of the University of Freiburg.

1:31:52.800 --> 1:31:56.040
 That's like the president of the university.

1:31:56.040 --> 1:32:01.000
 And that was in Germany, all the universities are state universities.

1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:03.320
 And so that's a political appointment.

1:32:03.320 --> 1:32:06.360
 Can we just pause on this point?

1:32:06.360 --> 1:32:13.640
 From an existentialist perspective, what's the role for standing up to evil?

1:32:13.640 --> 1:32:19.840
 So I mean, I think Camus probably had something to say about these things because he was a

1:32:19.840 --> 1:32:21.720
 bit of a political figure.

1:32:21.720 --> 1:32:28.600
 Like do you have a responsibility not just for your decisions, but if the world you see

1:32:28.600 --> 1:32:38.920
 around you is going against what you believe somewhere deep inside is ethical, do you have

1:32:38.920 --> 1:32:44.760
 a responsibility to stand up to that even if it costs you your life or your well being?

1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:49.640
 You ask from an existential perspective and there's lots of different positions that you

1:32:49.640 --> 1:32:50.640
 could have.

1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:57.640
 You do something in the area of what I think I might believe, which comes out of this tradition.

1:32:57.640 --> 1:33:05.800
 And it's this, if you live in a community where people are being dragged down by the

1:33:05.800 --> 1:33:13.920
 norms of the community rather than elevated, then there's two things that you have to recognize.

1:33:13.920 --> 1:33:20.080
 One is that you bear some responsibility for that, not necessarily because you chose it.

1:33:20.080 --> 1:33:21.360
 Maybe you reviled it.

1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:23.080
 Maybe you were against it.

1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:29.680
 But there's some way in which we all act in accordance with the norms of our culture.

1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:31.920
 We all give in to them in some way or another.

1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:37.280
 And if those norms are broken, then there's some way in which we've allowed ourselves

1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:43.000
 to be responsible for broken norms or we've become responsible for broken norms.

1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.440
 And I do think you have to face up to that.

1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:49.120
 I think that let's just take gender norms.

1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:51.400
 Maybe the gender norms are broken.

1:33:51.400 --> 1:33:56.800
 Maybe the way men and women treat one another or the way men treat women is broken.

1:33:56.800 --> 1:33:58.440
 Maybe it is.

1:33:58.440 --> 1:34:03.920
 Maybe I'm not making a substantive claim, I'm just saying, lots of people say it is.

1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:14.000
 And if you're in a culture where those norms take root, you don't get to just isolate yourself

1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:18.960
 and pull yourself out of the culture and think, I don't have any responsibility.

1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:24.720
 But you're already a part of the culture, even if you're isolating yourself from it.

1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:30.280
 That's a way of rejecting the sort of part you play in the culture, but it's not a way

1:34:30.280 --> 1:34:32.920
 of getting behind it.

1:34:32.920 --> 1:34:38.920
 Now you're playing that role differently, you're saying, I don't want to take responsibility

1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:41.240
 for what's going on around me.

1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:45.800
 And that's a way of taking responsibility by refusing to do it.

1:34:45.800 --> 1:34:50.560
 So I think we're implicated in whatever's going on around us.

1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:57.760
 And if we're going to do anything in our lives, we ought to recognize that, recognize that

1:34:57.760 --> 1:35:03.680
 even in situations where you maybe didn't decide to do it, you could be part of bringing

1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:05.600
 other people down.

1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:10.000
 And then devote yourself to trying to figure out how to act differently so that the norms

1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:16.000
 update themselves. And I think this is not a criticism of people.

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.720
 Aleosha, who we mentioned in the Brothers Karamazov, he's a character, he's a kind of

1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:24.600
 saintly character in the Brothers Karamazov.

1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:33.240
 But that one crucial moment in that story, when he realizes how awful he's been being

1:35:33.240 --> 1:35:38.640
 to someone without ever even intending to do that, it's Grushenka, who's this sort of

1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:47.480
 fascinating woman, and she's a very erotic woman, she's sort of sexual, and Aleosha,

1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:51.680
 in my reading of it, is kind of attracted to her.

1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:56.720
 But he's a young kid, he's 20 or whatever, and he's kind of embarrassed about it.

1:35:56.720 --> 1:36:00.520
 And he lives in the monastery, and he's thinking maybe he wants to be a priest, and he's kind

1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:01.560
 of embarrassed by it.

1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:02.960
 So what does he do?

1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:09.000
 Every time they run across one another in the street, he averts his gaze.

1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:10.240
 And why is he doing that?

1:36:10.240 --> 1:36:12.680
 Because he's kind of embarrassed.

1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:14.440
 But how does Grushenka experience it?

1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:19.000
 Well, she knows she's a fallen woman, and she knows that Aleosha has this other position

1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:20.500
 in society.

1:36:20.500 --> 1:36:24.320
 So her read on it is, he's passing judgment on me.

1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:27.640
 He can see that I, he doesn't want to be associated with me.

1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:29.480
 He can see that I'm a fallen woman.

1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:35.040
 He knows that in order to maintain his purity, he's got to avoid me.

1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:37.680
 That's not what Aleosha intended to do.

1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:39.560
 But that's the way it's experienced.

1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:44.640
 And so there's this way, he comes to recognize, oh my God, like what I'm supposed to do is

1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:48.520
 love people in Dostoevsky's view of things.

1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:51.600
 And what I'm doing instead is dragging this poor woman down.

1:36:51.600 --> 1:36:55.500
 I'm making her life worse, I'm making her feel terrible about herself.

1:36:55.500 --> 1:36:59.960
 And if I actually came to know her, I'd recognize her condition is difficult.

1:36:59.960 --> 1:37:01.640
 She's living a difficult life.

1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:03.200
 She's making hard choices.

1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:07.800
 And why don't I, you know, why don't I see that in her face instead of this other thing

1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:10.000
 that's making me want to avoid her?

1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:11.160
 And that's a huge moment.

1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:16.800
 So the idea is that we're implicated in bringing other people down, whether we want to be or

1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:17.800
 not.

1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:18.880
 And that's our condition.

1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:26.040
 The requirement to understand that is to be almost to a radical degree, be empathetic

1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:30.840
 and to listen to the world.

1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:33.920
 And I mean, you brought up sort of gender roles.

1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:35.600
 It's not so simple.

1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:37.000
 All of this is messy.

1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.760
 For example, this is me talking.

1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:47.880
 It's clear to me that, for example, the woke culture has bullying built into it, has some

1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:51.320
 elements of the same kind of evil built into it.

1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:56.880
 And when you're part of the wave of wokeness standing up for social rights, you also have

1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:00.860
 to listen and think, are we going too far?

1:38:00.860 --> 1:38:02.360
 Are we hurting people?

1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:09.020
 Are we doing the same things that others that we're fighting against that others were doing

1:38:09.020 --> 1:38:10.020
 in the past?

1:38:10.020 --> 1:38:19.120
 So it's not simple once you see that there's evil being done, that it's easy to fix.

1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:30.000
 No, in our society, there's something about our human nature that just too easily stops

1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:33.880
 listening to the world, to empathize with the world.

1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:35.640
 And we label things as evil.

1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:37.280
 This is through human history.

1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:38.280
 This is evil.

1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:40.080
 We mentioned tribes.

1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:44.600
 This religious belief is evil, and so we have to fight it, and we become certain and dogmatic

1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:49.000
 about it, and then in so doing, commit evil onto the world.

1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:59.080
 It seems like a life that accepts and responsibility for the norms we're in has to constantly be

1:38:59.080 --> 1:39:05.760
 sort of questioning yourself and questioning, like listening to the world fully and richly

1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:13.600
 without being weighed down by any one sort of realization.

1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:16.240
 You just always constantly have to be thinking about the world.

1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:17.240
 Am I wrong?

1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:18.760
 Am I wrong in seeing the world this way?

1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:23.760
 I mean, the very last thing you said, you've constantly got to be thinking about the world.

1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:25.280
 You've constantly got to be listening.

1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:28.800
 You've constantly got to be attending, and it's not simple.

1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:30.640
 All that sounds exactly right to me.

1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:35.040
 The phrase that rings through my head is another one from the Brothers Karamazov.

1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:45.640
 Dimitri, this passionate, sometimes violent brother who is also deeply cares.

1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:49.960
 Because he's passionate, he's sort of got care through and through, but it's breaking

1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:51.240
 him apart.

1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:57.840
 He says at one point, God and the devil are fighting in the battlefield is the heart of

1:39:57.840 --> 1:39:58.840
 man.

1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:02.680
 I just think, yeah, it's not simple.

1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:08.400
 And the idea that there might be a purely good way of doing things is just not our condition,

1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:13.040
 that everything we do is going to be sort of undermined by some aspect of it.

1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:18.240
 There's not going to be a kind of pure good in human existence.

1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:25.360
 And so it's sort of required that we're going to have to be empathetic, that we're going

1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:32.320
 to have to recognize that others are dealing with that just as we are.

1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:33.880
 So I apologize for distracting us.

1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:40.400
 We were talking about Heidegger, and the reason we're distracted is he happened to also be

1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:45.280
 a Nazi, but he nevertheless has a lot of powerful ideas.

1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:47.280
 What are the ideas he's brought to the world?

1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:48.280
 Okay.

1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:49.840
 So that's a big, huge question.

1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:54.320
 So let me see how much of it I can get on the table.

1:40:54.320 --> 1:41:00.040
 I mean, the big picture is that Heidegger thinks, and he's not really wrong to think

1:41:00.040 --> 1:41:07.880
 this, that the whole history of philosophy from Plato forward, maybe even from the Presocratics

1:41:07.880 --> 1:41:16.800
 forward, from like the 6th century BC to now, has been motivated by a certain, or has been

1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:22.480
 grounded on a certain kind of assumption that it didn't have the right to make, and that

1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:29.960
 it's led us astray, and that until we understand the way in which it's led us astray, we're

1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:34.360
 not going to be able to get to grips with the condition we now find ourselves in.

1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:39.120
 So let me start with what he thinks the condition we now find ourselves in is.

1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:41.800
 Lots of periods to Heidegger's views.

1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:46.440
 I'm just going to sort of mush it all together for the purposes of today.

1:41:46.440 --> 1:41:52.200
 Heidegger thinks that one of the crucial things that we need to contend with when we think

1:41:52.200 --> 1:42:01.120
 about what it is to be us now is that the right name for our age is a technological age.

1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:04.880
 What does it mean for our age to be a technological age?

1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:11.920
 Well it means that we have an understanding of what it is for anything at all to be at

1:42:11.920 --> 1:42:19.680
 all, that we never really chose, that sort of animating the way we live our lives, that's

1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:26.600
 animating our understanding of ourselves and everything else, that is quite limited.

1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:35.920
 And it's organized around the idea that to be something is to be what's sitting there

1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:45.680
 as an infinitely flexible reserve to be optimized and made efficient.

1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:57.200
 And Heidegger thinks that that's not just the way we think of Silicon Circuits or the

1:42:57.200 --> 1:43:02.640
 river when we put a hydroelectric power plant on it, we're optimizing the flow of the river

1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:07.760
 so that it makes energy which is infinitely flexible and we can use in any way at all.

1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:11.200
 It's the way we understand ourselves too.

1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:19.440
 We think of ourselves as this reserve of potential that needs to be made efficient and optimized.

1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:28.160
 And when I talk with my students about it, I ask them, what's your calendar look like?

1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:30.080
 What's the goal of your day?

1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:32.960
 Is it to get as many things into it as possible?

1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:41.360
 Is it to feel like I've failed unless I've made my life so efficient that I'm doing this

1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:45.800
 and this and this and this and this, that I can't let things go by?

1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:52.960
 The feeling that I think we all have that there's some pressure to do that, to relate

1:43:52.960 --> 1:44:00.440
 to ourselves that way is a clue to what Heidegger thinks the technological age is about.

1:44:00.440 --> 1:44:05.000
 And he thinks that's different from every other age in history.

1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:09.960
 We used to think of ourselves in the 17th century at the beginning of the Enlightenment

1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:14.520
 as subjects who represent objects.

1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:21.680
 Descartes thought that a subject is something, some mental sort of realm that represents

1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:23.640
 the world in a certain way.

1:44:23.640 --> 1:44:30.240
 And we're closed in on ourselves in the sense that we have a special relation to our representations

1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:32.960
 and that's what the realm of the subject is.

1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:37.520
 But others, in the Middle Ages, we were created in the image and likeness of God.

1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:44.520
 In the presecratic age, to be was to be what whooshes up and lingers for a while and fades

1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:53.800
 away the paradigm of what is, where's thunderstorms and the anger of the gods, Achilles battlefury,

1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:58.920
 and it overtakes everything and stays for a while and then leaves.

1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:00.960
 The flowers blooming in spring.

1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:04.760
 And that's very different from the way we experience ourselves.

1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:09.760
 And so the question is, what are we supposed to do in the face of that?

1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:17.800
 And Heidegger thinks that the presupposition that's motivated everything from the presecratics

1:45:17.800 --> 1:45:28.120
 forward is that there is some entity that's the ground of the way we understand everything

1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:29.480
 to be.

1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:31.440
 For the Middle Ages, it was God.

1:45:31.440 --> 1:45:35.600
 That was the entity that made things be the things that they are.

1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:40.760
 For the Enlightenment, it was us, maybe first art, it's us.

1:45:40.760 --> 1:45:47.000
 And Heidegger thinks whatever it is that stands at the ground of what we are, it's not another

1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:48.000
 thing.

1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:49.000
 It's not another entity.

1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:53.880
 And we're relating to it in the wrong way if we think of it like that.

1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:54.880
 There's some way.

1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:58.000
 And this is partly why I was interested in Meister Eckhart.

1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:03.480
 He says, what there is is there's giving going on in the world.

1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:08.160
 And we're the grateful recipient of it.

1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:13.020
 And the giving is like whatever it is, it's the social norms that we're thrown into.

1:46:13.020 --> 1:46:14.020
 We didn't choose them.

1:46:14.020 --> 1:46:15.200
 They were given to us.

1:46:15.200 --> 1:46:16.520
 And that's the ground.

1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:20.240
 That is what makes it possible for anything to be intelligible at all.

1:46:20.240 --> 1:46:24.720
 If we lived outside of communities, if we lived in a world where there were no social

1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:28.240
 norms at all, nothing would mean anything.

1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:29.920
 Nothing would have any significance.

1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:34.680
 Nothing would be regular in the way that things need to be regular in order for there to be

1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:39.600
 departures or manifestations of that regularity.

1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:46.760
 So community norms are crucial, but they're also always updating.

1:46:46.760 --> 1:46:54.000
 We have some responsibility for what they are and the way in which they're updating themselves.

1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:57.320
 And yet we didn't ever choose it to be that way.

1:46:57.320 --> 1:47:05.880
 So those norms are somehow giving significance to us in a way that we're implicated in.

1:47:05.880 --> 1:47:08.080
 We have some relation to.

1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:13.200
 And all that gets covered over if you think of us as efficient resources to be optimized.

1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:18.960
 Is that a conflicting view that we are resources to be optimized?

1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:23.960
 Is that somehow deeply conflicting with the fact that there's a ground that we stand on?

1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:24.960
 Absolutely.

1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:30.760
 So what Heidegger thinks is that he calls this the supreme danger of the technological

1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:36.000
 age, is that without ever having chosen it, without ever having decided it, this is the

1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:39.160
 way we understand what it is to be us.

1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:46.680
 But he thinks that it's also, he says, quoting Holderlin, the 18th century German poet.

1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:51.240
 He says, in the supreme danger lies the saving possibility.

1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:52.920
 So what does that mean?

1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:58.280
 It means that this is the understanding that we've been thrown into, that we've been given.

1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:00.560
 It's the gift that was given to us.

1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:01.800
 It's supremely dangerous.

1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:06.720
 If we let ourselves live that way, we'll destroy ourselves.

1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:14.520
 But it's also the saving possibility because if we recognize that we never chose that,

1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:20.360
 that it was given to us, but also we were implicated in its being given, and we could

1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:26.240
 find a way to supersede it, that it's the ground, but it's also updatable.

1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:30.360
 He calls the ground the groundless ground.

1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:38.080
 It's not like an entity which is there, solid, stable, like God, who's eternal and non changing.

1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:43.320
 It's always updating itself, and we're always involved in its being updated, but we're only

1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:49.400
 involved in it in the right way if we listen, like Miles Davis.

1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:55.480
 So optimization is not a good way to live life.

1:48:55.480 --> 1:49:02.760
 If you thought that it was obviously clear that that was the relevant value, so obviously

1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:07.360
 clear that it never even occurred to you to ask whether it was right to think that, then

1:49:07.360 --> 1:49:08.840
 you would be in danger.

1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:09.840
 Yeah.

1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:10.840
 Got it.

1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:16.240
 So yeah, there is some in this modern technological age, in the full meaning of the word technology

1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:23.520
 that's updated to actual modern age with a lot more technology going on.

1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:29.440
 It does feel like colleagues of mine in the tech space actually are somehow drawn to that

1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:35.960
 optimization as if that's going to save us, as if the thing that truly weighs us down

1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:38.880
 is the inefficiencies.

1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:40.080
 Exactly.

1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:45.680
 And I think if you think about other contexts, like what are the moments when, I mean, we're

1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:47.560
 unique in this respect.

1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:53.000
 This period in history is unlike any previous, nobody ever felt that way.

1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:58.480
 But think about, but it's also true that no previous period in history was nihilistic.

1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:03.800
 So our condition is tied up, that sort of thing is meant to be a response to the felt

1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:05.840
 lack of a ground.

1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:11.160
 And so no previous epoch in history felt that way.

1:50:11.160 --> 1:50:13.280
 They didn't have our problem.

1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:22.440
 But so it was much more natural to them to experience moments in ways that feel unachievable

1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:26.120
 for us, what we were calling moments of aliveness before.

1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:28.600
 Think about the context in which they felt them.

1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:31.800
 They weren't efficient, optimized contexts.

1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:33.760
 Think about the Greeks.

1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:37.520
 If you ever read Homer, it is a bizarre world back there.

1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:45.720
 But one of the things that's bizarre is that they're so unmotivated by efficiency and optimizing

1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:52.240
 that the only thing that seems to run through all of the different Greek cultures is the

1:50:52.240 --> 1:51:02.640
 idea that if some stranger comes by, you better take care of them because Zeus is the God

1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:04.840
 of strangers and Zeus will be angry.

1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:05.840
 That's what they say, right?

1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:08.040
 But how does it manifest itself?

1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:12.320
 Odysseus, he's trying to get home and he gets shipwrecked on an island.

1:51:12.320 --> 1:51:16.680
 And he's trying to figure out how he's been at sea for 10 days.

1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:17.680
 He's starving.

1:51:17.680 --> 1:51:23.280
 He's bedraggled and he sees now Cissa, the princess who's beautiful.

1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:28.200
 And he's like, boy, I better, I don't know, get some clothes or something.

1:51:28.200 --> 1:51:31.280
 I don't want them to beat me up and kill me.

1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:37.800
 And so she takes him to the palace, they have three days of banquets and festivals before

1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:41.100
 they even ask his name.

1:51:41.100 --> 1:51:43.400
 It's like, here's a stranger.

1:51:43.400 --> 1:51:48.480
 Our job is to celebrate the presence of a stranger because this is where significance

1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:49.480
 lies.

1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:54.140
 Now, we don't have to feel that way, but the idea that that's one of the places where

1:51:54.140 --> 1:51:59.640
 significance could lie is pretty strongly at odds with the idea that our salvation is

1:51:59.640 --> 1:52:02.120
 going to come from optimization and efficiency.

1:52:02.120 --> 1:52:08.480
 Maybe something about the way we live our lives will have that integrated into it.

1:52:08.480 --> 1:52:12.160
 But it's at odds with other moments.

1:52:12.160 --> 1:52:16.780
 Let me ask you a question about Hubert Dreyfus.

1:52:16.780 --> 1:52:24.200
 He is a friend, a colleague, a mentor of yours, unfortunately no longer with us.

1:52:24.200 --> 1:52:30.880
 You wrote with him the book titled All Things Shining, Reading the Western Classics to Find

1:52:30.880 --> 1:52:33.480
 Meaning in a Secular Age.

1:52:33.480 --> 1:52:40.000
 First, can you maybe speak about who that man was, what you learned from him?

1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:45.800
 And then we can maybe ask, how do we find through the classics, meaning in a secular

1:52:45.800 --> 1:52:46.800
 age?

1:52:46.800 --> 1:52:48.600
 Okay.

1:52:48.600 --> 1:52:58.560
 So Hubert Dreyfus was a very important philosopher of the late 20th, early 21st century.

1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:03.240
 He died in 2017, about a little over four years ago.

1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:04.240
 He was my teacher.

1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:09.320
 I met him in 1989 when I went away to graduate school in Berkeley.

1:53:09.320 --> 1:53:10.880
 That's where he taught.

1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:18.120
 He plays an interesting and important role in the history of philosophy in America because

1:53:18.120 --> 1:53:26.440
 in a period when most philosophers in America and in the English speaking world were not

1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:31.040
 taking seriously 20th century French and German philosophy, he was.

1:53:31.040 --> 1:53:37.400
 And he was really probably the most important English speaking interpreter of Heidegger,

1:53:37.400 --> 1:53:41.360
 the German philosopher that we've been talking about.

1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:44.520
 He was an incredible teacher.

1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:47.840
 A lot of his influence came through his teaching.

1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:59.720
 And one of the amazing things about him as a teacher was his sort of mix of intellectual

1:53:59.720 --> 1:54:05.360
 humility with sort of deep, insightful authority.

1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:11.280
 And he would stand up in front of a class of 300 students, he taught huge classes because

1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:13.120
 people loved to go see him.

1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:16.200
 And I taught for him for many years.

1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:21.840
 And say, I've been reading this text for 40 years, but the question you asked is one

1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:23.400
 I've never asked.

1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:26.320
 And it would be true.

1:54:26.320 --> 1:54:32.080
 He would find in what people said things that were surprising and new to him.

1:54:32.080 --> 1:54:33.720
 And that's humility actually.

1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:36.600
 That is listening to the world.

1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:37.600
 Absolutely.

1:54:37.600 --> 1:54:38.600
 Absolutely.

1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:44.320
 He was always ready to be surprised by something that someone said.

1:54:44.320 --> 1:54:46.680
 And there's just something astonishing about that.

1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:52.080
 So his influence was, you know, for people who didn't know him through his interpretations

1:54:52.080 --> 1:54:55.160
 of these texts, he wrote about a huge range of stuff.

1:54:55.160 --> 1:54:57.800
 But for people who didn't know him, it was through his presence.

1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:02.360
 It was through the way he carried himself in his life.

1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:05.360
 And so in any case, that's who he was.

1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:11.960
 We I graduated after many years as a graduate student, I didn't start in philosophy, I started

1:55:11.960 --> 1:55:12.960
 in math.

1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:14.480
 I did computer science actually.

1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:17.880
 And then I did a lot of work in computational neuroscience for a few years.

1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:19.520
 It's a fascinating journey.

1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:24.520
 We'll get to it through our friendly conversation about artificial intelligence.

1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:31.880
 I'm sure because you're basically fascinated with the philosophy of mind of the human mind

1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:38.920
 but rooted in a curiosity of mind through the its artificial, through the engineering

1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:39.920
 of mind.

1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:40.920
 Yeah.

1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:41.920
 Yeah.

1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:42.920
 That's right.

1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:48.800
 The reason I was attracted to him actually is because of his, to begin with, was because

1:55:48.800 --> 1:55:54.560
 of his criticisms of what was called traditional symbolic AI in the 70s and 80s.

1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:58.960
 So I came to Berkeley as a graduate student who'd done a lot of math and a lot of computer

1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:01.800
 science, a lot of computational neuroscience.

1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:07.440
 I noticed that you had, you interview a lot of people in this world.

1:56:07.440 --> 1:56:13.880
 And I had a teacher at Brown as an undergraduate, Jim Anderson, who wrote with Jeff Hinton,

1:56:13.880 --> 1:56:16.600
 a big book on neural networks.

1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:24.360
 So I was interested in that, not so interested in traditional AI, like sort of LISP programings,

1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:31.200
 things that went on in the 80s, because it felt sort of when you made a system do something,

1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:34.960
 all of a sudden it was an interesting thing to have done.

1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:38.720
 The fact that you'd solved the problem then made it clear that the problem wasn't an interesting

1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:40.720
 one to solve.

1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:42.360
 And I had that experience.

1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:51.120
 And Burt had criticisms of symbolic AI, what he called good old fashioned AI, GOFI.

1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:56.920
 And I was attracted to those criticisms because it felt to me that there was something lacking

1:56:56.920 --> 1:56:58.840
 in that project.

1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:00.400
 And I didn't know what it was.

1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:03.360
 I just felt its absence.

1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:10.720
 And then I learned that all his arguments came from his reading of this phenomenological

1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:12.600
 and existential tradition.

1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:15.160
 And so I had to try to figure out what those folks were saying.

1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:16.160
 And it was a long road.

1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:19.520
 Let me tell you, it took me a long time.

1:57:19.520 --> 1:57:21.560
 But it was because of Burt that I was able to do that.

1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:23.920
 So I owe him that huge debt of gratitude.

1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:28.720
 And eventually we went on to write a book together, which was a great experience.

1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:31.840
 And yes, we published All Things Shining in 2011.

1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:37.440
 And that's a book that I definitely would not have had the chutzpah to try to write

1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:43.280
 if it weren't for Burt, because it was really about great literature in the history of the

1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:47.760
 West from Homer and Virgil and Dante to Melville.

1:57:47.760 --> 1:57:53.120
 There's a huge chapter on Melville, a big chapter on David Foster Wallace, who Burt

1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:54.120
 didn't care about at all.

1:57:54.120 --> 1:57:56.200
 But I was fascinated by it.

1:57:56.200 --> 1:58:04.360
 And so learning to think that way while writing that book with him was an amazing experience.

1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:10.240
 So I have to admit, as one of my failings in life, one of many failings is I've never

1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:15.360
 gotten through Moby Dick or any of Melville's works.

1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:21.000
 So maybe can you comment on, before we talk about David Foster Wallace, who I have gotten

1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:28.280
 through, what are some of the sources of meaning in these classics?

1:58:28.280 --> 1:58:29.280
 Good.

1:58:29.280 --> 1:58:33.840
 So Moby Dick, I think, is the other great novel of the 19th century.

1:58:33.840 --> 1:58:38.480
 So The Brothers Karamazov and Moby Dick, and they're diametrically opposed, which is one

1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:40.280
 of the really interesting things.

1:58:40.280 --> 1:58:48.560
 So the Brothers Karamazov is a kind of existential interpretation of Russian Orthodox Christianity.

1:58:48.560 --> 1:58:52.400
 How do you live that way and find joy in your existence?

1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:55.360
 Moby Dick is not at all about Christianity.

1:58:55.360 --> 1:59:06.560
 It sort of starts with the observation that the form of Christianity that Ishmael is familiar

1:59:06.560 --> 1:59:07.560
 with is broken.

1:59:07.560 --> 1:59:11.240
 It's not going to work in his living, his life.

1:59:11.240 --> 1:59:12.640
 He has to leave it.

1:59:12.640 --> 1:59:18.200
 He has to go to sea in order to find what needs to happen.

1:59:18.200 --> 1:59:23.720
 And Ishmael is the wailing boat captain.

1:59:23.720 --> 1:59:25.160
 So he's not the captain.

1:59:25.160 --> 1:59:26.160
 That's Ahab.

1:59:26.160 --> 1:59:27.160
 Ahab is the captain.

1:59:27.160 --> 1:59:28.160
 Yeah, right.

1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:29.160
 Let me back up.

1:59:29.160 --> 1:59:32.200
 The famous opening line to the book is, call me Ishmael.

1:59:32.200 --> 1:59:35.600
 And Ishmael is the main character in the book.

1:59:35.600 --> 1:59:36.920
 He's a nobody.

1:59:36.920 --> 1:59:37.920
 He's you and me.

1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:39.400
 He's the everyday guy.

1:59:39.400 --> 1:59:41.480
 He's like a nobody on the ship.

1:59:41.480 --> 1:59:44.920
 He's not the lowest, but certainly not the highest.

1:59:44.920 --> 1:59:47.360
 He's right in the middle.

1:59:47.360 --> 1:59:52.440
 And he's named Ishmael, which is interesting because Ishmael is the illegitimate son of

1:59:52.440 --> 1:59:55.400
 Abraham in the Old Testament.

1:59:55.400 --> 2:00:01.080
 He is the, I think if I have it right, again, someone will correct me.

2:00:01.080 --> 2:00:08.800
 I think he's the one that Islam traces its genesis to.

2:00:08.800 --> 2:00:15.480
 And so Islam is an Abrahamic religion like Judaism and Christianity, but Judaism and

2:00:15.480 --> 2:00:21.960
 Christianity trace their lineage through Isaac, the quote unquote legitimate son of Abraham.

2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:28.160
 And Ishmael is the other son of Abraham who he had with a girlfriend.

2:00:28.160 --> 2:00:33.000
 And so he's clearly outside of Christianity in some way.

2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:39.440
 He's named after the non Christian sort of son of Abraham.

2:00:39.440 --> 2:00:46.600
 And the book starts out with this, what does he call it, something like a dark and misty

2:00:46.600 --> 2:00:50.040
 November mood.

2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:55.400
 He's walking along the street and he's overcome by his, I can't remember what the word is,

2:00:55.400 --> 2:00:57.960
 but his hypos, that's what he calls them.

2:00:57.960 --> 2:00:58.960
 He's in a mood.

2:00:58.960 --> 2:00:59.960
 He's depressed.

2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:01.640
 He's down.

2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:02.920
 Things are not going well.

2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:05.080
 And that's where he starts.

2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:13.840
 And he signs up to go on this whaling voyage with this captain, Ahab, who is this incredibly

2:01:13.840 --> 2:01:22.920
 charismatic, deeply disturbing character who is a captain who's got lots of history and

2:01:22.920 --> 2:01:25.960
 wants to go whaling, wants to get whales.

2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:26.960
 That's what they do.

2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:31.960
 They harpoon these whales and bring them back and sell the blubber and the oil and so on.

2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:36.000
 So he's kind of rich and he's famous and he's powerful.

2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:43.440
 He's an authority figure and he is megalomaniacally obsessed with getting one particular whale,

2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:45.160
 which is called Moby Dick.

2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:51.200
 And Moby Dick is like the largest, the whitest, the sort of most terrifying of all the whales.

2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:56.760
 And Ahab wants to get him because a number of years earlier, he had an encounter with

2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:00.560
 Moby Dick where Moby Dick bit off his leg.

2:02:00.560 --> 2:02:08.440
 And he survived, but he had this deeply religious experience in the wake of it.

2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:12.200
 And he needed to find out what the meaning of that was.

2:02:12.200 --> 2:02:14.400
 What is the meaning of my suffering?

2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:20.440
 Who am I such that the world and Moby Dick, this Leviathan at the center of it should

2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:22.640
 treat me this way?

2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:29.160
 And so his task is not just to go whaling, it's to figure out the meaning of the universe

2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:36.280
 through going whaling and having a confrontation with his tormentor, this whale, Moby Dick.

2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:41.520
 And the confrontation is so weird because Melville points out that whales, their faces

2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:44.080
 are so huge.

2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:49.960
 Their foreheads are so huge and their eyes are on the side of them that you can never

2:02:49.960 --> 2:02:52.480
 actually look them in the eye.

2:02:52.480 --> 2:02:57.800
 And it's kind of a metaphor for God, like you can't ever look God in the face.

2:02:57.800 --> 2:03:00.120
 That's the sort of traditional thing to say about God.

2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:05.880
 You can't find the ultimate meaning of the universe by looking God in the face.

2:03:05.880 --> 2:03:07.480
 But Ahab wants to.

2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:13.280
 He says he's got a pasteboard mask of a face, but I'll strike through the mask and find

2:03:13.280 --> 2:03:15.240
 out what's behind.

2:03:15.240 --> 2:03:19.840
 And so Ishmael is sort of caught up in this thing and he's like going whaling because

2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:21.960
 he's in a bad mood.

2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:28.040
 And maybe this will make things better and he makes friends with this guy, Queequeg,

2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:30.560
 and Queequeg is a pagan.

2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:37.000
 He's from an island in the South Pacific and he's got tattoos all over his body, head

2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:38.520
 to toe.

2:03:38.520 --> 2:03:45.480
 He's a party colored, like every different color, says Ishmael, is these tattoos.

2:03:45.480 --> 2:03:54.680
 And they are the writing on his body, he says, of the immutable mysteries of the universe

2:03:54.680 --> 2:03:58.520
 as understood through his culture.

2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:06.280
 And so somehow Queequeg is this character who is like not Christian at all.

2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:09.320
 And he's powerful in a very different way than Ahab is.

2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:10.840
 He's supposed to be the king.

2:04:10.840 --> 2:04:13.760
 He's the son of the king and probably his father's died by now.

2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:15.840
 And if he went home, he'd be the king.

2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:20.000
 But he's off on a voyage too, trying to understand who he is before he goes back and leads his

2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:21.000
 people.

2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:25.400
 And he's a harpooner, the bravest of the people on the ship.

2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:32.760
 And he's got the mystery of the universe tattooed on his body, but nobody can understand it.

2:04:32.760 --> 2:04:39.280
 And it's through his relation with Queequeg that Ishmael comes to get a different understanding

2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:40.760
 of what we might be about.

2:04:40.760 --> 2:04:42.720
 So that's Moby Dick.

2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:45.240
 In a nutshell.

2:04:45.240 --> 2:04:50.920
 And connected to a book I have read, which is funny, there's probably echoes that represent

2:04:50.920 --> 2:05:01.160
 the 20th century now in Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway, that also has similar, I guess,

2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:09.120
 themes, but more personal, more focused on the, I mean, I guess it's less about God.

2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:13.520
 It's almost more like the existentialist version of Moby Dick.

2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:14.520
 And hence shorter.

2:05:14.520 --> 2:05:15.520
 And a lot shorter.

2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:16.520
 Yeah.

2:05:16.520 --> 2:05:19.320
 Well, Hemingway was brilliant that way.

2:05:19.320 --> 2:05:23.920
 But do you see echoes and do you find Old Man and the Sea interesting?

2:05:23.920 --> 2:05:29.080
 It's been since ninth grade that I read Old Man and the Sea even longer ago than the Fountain

2:05:29.080 --> 2:05:30.080
 Head.

2:05:30.080 --> 2:05:31.680
 So I didn't know we were going to go there.

2:05:31.680 --> 2:05:37.360
 I mean, I find Hemingway interesting, but Hemingway, my general sort of picture of him

2:05:37.360 --> 2:05:44.320
 is that, you know, he's, we have to confront the dangers and the difficulties of our life.

2:05:44.320 --> 2:05:48.280
 We have to develop in ourselves a certain kind of courage and manliness.

2:05:48.280 --> 2:05:50.720
 And I think there's something interesting about that.

2:05:50.720 --> 2:05:54.120
 He's for risk in a certain way.

2:05:54.120 --> 2:05:56.760
 And I think that's important.

2:05:56.760 --> 2:06:02.080
 But I do, now I don't have any right to say this since it's been so long since I read

2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:03.080
 it.

2:06:03.080 --> 2:06:11.840
 I mean, I feel like there's, I don't remember a sense for the quite the tragedy of it.

2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:12.840
 Maybe there is.

2:06:12.840 --> 2:06:14.200
 Is it a melancholy novel?

2:06:14.200 --> 2:06:15.440
 I don't even remember.

2:06:15.440 --> 2:06:22.680
 No, it's, I mean, it has a sense like The Stranger by Camus, it has a sense of like this is

2:06:22.680 --> 2:06:31.920
 how life is and it like has more about old age and that you're not quite the man you

2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:36.760
 used to be feeling of like, this is how time passes.

2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:41.880
 And then the passing of time and how you get old and you get older.

2:06:41.880 --> 2:06:44.240
 And this is one last fish.

2:06:44.240 --> 2:06:46.560
 It's less about this is the fish.

2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:48.960
 It's more like this is one last fish.

2:06:48.960 --> 2:06:56.960
 Like, and asking who was I, who was I as a man as a human being in this world?

2:06:56.960 --> 2:07:00.520
 And this one fish helps you ask that question fully.

2:07:00.520 --> 2:07:01.520
 Wonderful.

2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:06.560
 But it's one fish, which is just sort of all the other fish too, right?

2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:13.000
 And that is a big difference because for, for AHAB, no other fish will do than Moby

2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:14.000
 Dick.

2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:18.160
 It's got to be the biggest, the most powerful, the most tormenting.

2:07:18.160 --> 2:07:22.640
 It's got to be the one that you've got history with that has defiled you.

2:07:22.640 --> 2:07:28.160
 And it's, it's a raucous ride, Moby Dick.

2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:29.960
 What about David Foster Wallace?

2:07:29.960 --> 2:07:36.000
 So why is he important to you in the search of meaning in a secular age?

2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:37.000
 Good.

2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:39.680
 So, so I'll just, I'll just, just to finish the Moby Dick thing.

2:07:39.680 --> 2:07:44.920
 I think what's interesting about Melville is that he thinks our salvation comes not

2:07:44.920 --> 2:07:48.840
 if we get in the right relation to monotheism or Christianity, but if we get in the right

2:07:48.840 --> 2:07:54.920
 relation to polytheism, to the idea that there's not a unity to our existence.

2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:57.120
 But there are lots of little meanings.

2:07:57.120 --> 2:08:04.520
 And they don't cohere sometimes, you know, uh, like in, like in Homer, sometimes you're

2:08:04.520 --> 2:08:05.520
 in love.

2:08:05.520 --> 2:08:09.160
 Helen's in love with Paris and they do crazy things.

2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:12.440
 They go off and run away and the Trojan war begins.

2:08:12.440 --> 2:08:16.880
 And sometimes you're in a battle fury that's where their love is Aphrodite's realm and

2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:20.560
 the battle fury, that's Ares realm and that's a totally different world.

2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:22.880
 And they're not even, I mean, they're related.

2:08:22.880 --> 2:08:25.840
 There's a kind of family resemblance, but not much.

2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:30.320
 Really you're just in different sort of local meaningful worlds.

2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:36.440
 And Melville seems to think that that's, that's a thing that we could aim to bring back.

2:08:36.440 --> 2:08:43.720
 He says, we have to lure back the Mary May Day gods of old and, and lovingly enthrone

2:08:43.720 --> 2:08:48.040
 them in the now egotistical sky, the now unhaunted hill.

2:08:48.040 --> 2:08:52.200
 That's what we live in this world where hills aren't, aren't haunted with significance anymore

2:08:52.200 --> 2:08:57.920
 and the sky is just a bunch of stuff that we're studying with physics and astrophysics

2:08:57.920 --> 2:08:58.920
 and stuff.

2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:04.080
 But, but they used to be awe inspiring and we have to figure out how to get in that relation

2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:09.320
 to them, but not by trying to give a unity to our existence through developing habits

2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:12.280
 and practices that get written on our body.

2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:19.840
 And so his is about the end of Judeo Christianity and the sort of Roman appropriation of it.

2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:25.120
 And Wallace, what, one of the things I think is so interesting about him is that I think

2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:31.480
 he is a great observer of the contemporary world and he's a very funny writer, right?

2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:35.600
 He's really funny, but he's a great observer of the contemporary world.

2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:42.960
 What he thought was at the core of the contemporary world was this constant temptation to diversion

2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:43.960
 through entertainment.

2:09:43.960 --> 2:09:49.800
 That's a different story than the Heidegger story about efficiency and optimization.

2:09:49.800 --> 2:09:51.720
 But it's the other side of it.

2:09:51.720 --> 2:09:55.800
 What is this temptation sort of diverting us from?

2:09:55.800 --> 2:09:58.480
 The ability to be more efficient.

2:09:58.480 --> 2:10:05.480
 So you're tempted to go watch some stupid film or television show or something that's

2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:11.320
 dumb and not really very interesting, but you read that temptation as a temptation precisely

2:10:11.320 --> 2:10:15.960
 in virtue of it's taking you away from your optimizing your existence.

2:10:15.960 --> 2:10:18.000
 And so I think they're two sides of the same coin.

2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.320
 I think he's brilliant at describing it.

2:10:20.320 --> 2:10:26.320
 I think he thought it was a desperate position to be in that it was something that we needed

2:10:26.320 --> 2:10:30.200
 to confront and find a way out of.

2:10:30.200 --> 2:10:33.040
 And his characters are trying to do that.

2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:39.000
 And I think there's two different David Foster Wallace's, one, I mean, David Foster Wallace

2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:42.720
 committed suicide and it's very sad.

2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:49.680
 And he clearly did have, you know, sort of, there was a physiological basis to his condition.

2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:50.680
 He knew it.

2:10:50.680 --> 2:10:53.320
 He was treating it for decades with medication.

2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:57.280
 He had electroshock therapy a number of times.

2:10:57.280 --> 2:11:00.200
 It's just very, very sad story.

2:11:00.200 --> 2:11:04.200
 When I decided that we were going to write about David Foster Wallace, the first thing

2:11:04.200 --> 2:11:11.840
 I was worried about is what, can you, can you, like obviously a motivating factor, maybe

2:11:11.840 --> 2:11:17.400
 the motivating factor in his committing suicide was his physiological condition.

2:11:17.400 --> 2:11:21.200
 But there was, there's, there's this, there was a question.

2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:26.480
 Could you think, I mean, he's obsessed with the condition with what we need to do to achieve

2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:32.040
 our salvation, to live well, to make our lives worth living.

2:11:32.040 --> 2:11:37.280
 And he clearly in the end felt like he couldn't do that.

2:11:37.280 --> 2:11:41.440
 So in addition to the physiological thing, which probably most of it.

2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:48.920
 The question for me was, could you find in his writing, what his, what he was identifying

2:11:48.920 --> 2:11:55.240
 as the thing we needed to be doing, that he nevertheless felt we couldn't be doing.

2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:59.960
 And he talks as if that's, that's the difficulty for him.

2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:01.720
 So that, that's one side of him.

2:12:01.720 --> 2:12:06.120
 And I did want to find that, but I think there's another side of him that's very different,

2:12:06.120 --> 2:12:07.120
 but you were going to ask.

2:12:07.120 --> 2:12:08.120
 No, please.

2:12:08.120 --> 2:12:09.120
 What's the other side?

2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:16.760
 I mean, what I write about in the, in the chapter mostly is what I think he's got as

2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:21.080
 our, as, as our saving possibility.

2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:25.160
 He thinks our saving possibility, he says this in a graduation speech that he gave to

2:12:25.160 --> 2:12:33.600
 Kenyon is that we have the freedom to interpret situations however we like.

2:12:33.600 --> 2:12:36.000
 So what's the problem case for him?

2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:40.480
 He says, look, you know, the problem case, we have, we have it all the time.

2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:47.560
 You get pissed off at the world, you know, some, some big SUV cuts you off on the highway

2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:55.200
 and you're pissed off and you might express your anger with one finger or another directed

2:12:55.200 --> 2:12:56.520
 at that person.

2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:03.440
 And he says, but actually, you know, you're being pissed off as the result of your having

2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:05.200
 made an assumption.

2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:08.680
 And the assumption is that that action was directed at you.

2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:15.000
 Like the assumption is that you're the center of the universe and you shouldn't assume that.

2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:21.880
 And the way to talk yourself out of it, he says, is to recognize the possibility that

2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:24.680
 maybe that wasn't an action directed at you.

2:13:24.680 --> 2:13:33.680
 Like maybe that guy is racing to the hospital, you know, to take care of his dying spouse

2:13:33.680 --> 2:13:39.600
 who's been there suffering, you know, from cancer, or maybe he's, you know, on the way

2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:44.760
 to pick up a sick child or maybe he's, and it's not an action directed.

2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:49.320
 That was your assumption, not something that was inherent in the situation.

2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:52.160
 And I think there's something interesting about that.

2:13:52.160 --> 2:13:55.000
 I think there's something right about that.

2:13:55.000 --> 2:14:04.040
 At the same time, I don't think he speaks as if we can just spin out these stories.

2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:07.080
 And whether they're true or not, doesn't matter.

2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:11.320
 What matters is that they free us from this assumption.

2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:15.600
 And I think they only free us from this assumption if they're true.

2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:20.120
 Like sometimes the guy really did direct it at you and that's part of the situation.

2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:23.240
 And like you can't pretend that it's not part of the situation.

2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:25.440
 You have to find the right way of dealing with that situation.

2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:29.280
 So you have to listen to what's actually happening.

2:14:29.280 --> 2:14:32.120
 And then you have to figure out how to make it right.

2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:35.160
 And I think he thinks that we have too much freedom.

2:14:35.160 --> 2:14:38.320
 He thinks that you don't have to listen to the situation, you can just tell whatever

2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:40.960
 story you like about it.

2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:43.760
 And I think that's actually too tough.

2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:47.160
 I don't think we have that kind of freedom.

2:14:47.160 --> 2:14:52.000
 And he writes these sort of incredibly moving letters when he's trying to write The Pale

2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:58.480
 King, which is the unfinished novel that really sort of drove him to distraction.

2:14:58.480 --> 2:15:04.080
 At the center of the novel is this character who, one of the characters at the center of

2:15:04.080 --> 2:15:11.360
 the novel is a guy who's doing the most boring thing you could possibly imagine.

2:15:11.360 --> 2:15:14.320
 He is an IRS tax examiner.

2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:19.480
 He's going over other people's tax returns, trying to figure out whether they follow the

2:15:19.480 --> 2:15:21.600
 rules or not.

2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:27.400
 And just the idea of doing that for eight hours a day is just terrifying.

2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:34.480
 And he puts this guy in an enormous warehouse that extends for miles where person after

2:15:34.480 --> 2:15:42.520
 person after person is in rows of desks, sort of nameless, each of them doing this task.

2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:48.040
 So he's in nowhere doing nothing, and it's got to be intensely boring.

2:15:48.040 --> 2:15:53.520
 And now the main character is trying to teach himself to do that.

2:15:53.520 --> 2:15:56.520
 And the question is, how do you put up with the boredom?

2:15:56.520 --> 2:16:01.120
 How do you put up with this onslaught of meaninglessness?

2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:11.880
 And the main character is able to confront that condition with such bliss that he literally

2:16:11.880 --> 2:16:17.280
 levitates from happiness while he's going over other people's tax returns.

2:16:17.280 --> 2:16:22.720
 And that's my metaphor for what I think Wallace must have imagined we have to try to aspire

2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:24.400
 to.

2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:25.800
 And I think that's unlivable.

2:16:25.800 --> 2:16:29.480
 I think that's not an ambition that we could achieve.

2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:31.880
 I think there's something else we could achieve.

2:16:31.880 --> 2:16:38.400
 And the other thing that we can achieve that I think is something that he also is onto,

2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:47.880
 but doesn't write about as often, is something more like achieving peak moments of significance

2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:50.920
 in a situation when something great happens.

2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:54.520
 And he writes about this in an article about Roger Federer.

2:16:54.520 --> 2:16:55.760
 He loved tennis.

2:16:55.760 --> 2:16:57.120
 Are you a tennis lover?

2:16:57.120 --> 2:17:01.160
 I'm not a lover of tennis, but I played tennis for 15 years and so on.

2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:05.600
 I don't love it the way people love baseball, for example.

2:17:05.600 --> 2:17:07.840
 I see the beauty in it, the artistry.

2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:09.560
 I just liked it as a sport.

2:17:09.560 --> 2:17:10.560
 Good.

2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:11.560
 Okay.

2:17:11.560 --> 2:17:14.160
 Well, I didn't play much tennis, but I hit a ball around every once in a while as a

2:17:14.160 --> 2:17:15.160
 kid.

2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:20.240
 And I always thought it was boring to watch, but reading David Foster Wallace on Roger

2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:23.400
 Federer, you're like, wow, I've been missing something.

2:17:23.400 --> 2:17:26.960
 And the article, which appeared in the New York Times magazine, was called Roger Federer

2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:28.640
 as religious experience.

2:17:28.640 --> 2:17:29.640
 Oh, wow.

2:17:29.640 --> 2:17:30.640
 There you go.

2:17:30.640 --> 2:17:36.920
 And he says, look, there's something astonishing about watching someone who's got a body like

2:17:36.920 --> 2:17:40.680
 us and having a body is a limitation.

2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:48.320
 It's like the sight of sores and pains and agony and exhaustion and it's the thing that

2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:51.040
 dies in the end.

2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:53.200
 And so it's what we have to confront.

2:17:53.200 --> 2:17:56.920
 I mean, there's also joys that go along with having a body.

2:17:56.920 --> 2:17:58.800
 Like if you didn't have a body, there'd be no sex.

2:17:58.800 --> 2:18:04.600
 If you didn't have a body, there'd be no sort of physical excitement and so on.

2:18:04.600 --> 2:18:11.040
 But somehow having a body is essentially a limitation that when you watch someone who's

2:18:11.040 --> 2:18:17.320
 got one and is extraordinary at the way they use it, you can recognize how that limitation

2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:20.480
 can be to some degree transcended.

2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:26.120
 And that that's what we can get when we watch Federer or some other great athlete sort of

2:18:26.120 --> 2:18:31.240
 doing these things that transcend the limitations of their bodies.

2:18:31.240 --> 2:18:37.080
 And that that's the kind of peak experience that we're capable of that could be a kind

2:18:37.080 --> 2:18:38.080
 of salvation.

2:18:38.080 --> 2:18:40.160
 That's a very different story.

2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:45.480
 And I think that's a livable story and I don't know if it would have saved him, but

2:18:45.480 --> 2:18:50.840
 I feel like I wish he'd developed that side of the story more.

2:18:50.840 --> 2:18:55.240
 Can we talk about, and first of all, let me just comment that I deeply appreciate that

2:18:55.240 --> 2:19:01.560
 you said you were going to say something, that the fact that you're listening to me is amazing,

2:19:01.560 --> 2:19:05.800
 like that you care about other humans and I really appreciate that.

2:19:05.800 --> 2:19:07.840
 We should be in this way listening to the world.

2:19:07.840 --> 2:19:14.160
 So there's that's a meta comment about many of the things we're talking about.

2:19:14.160 --> 2:19:20.440
 But you mentioned something about levitating and a task that is infinitely boring and contrasting

2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:28.520
 that with essentially levitating on a task that is great, like the highest achievement

2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:33.360
 of this physical limiting body in playing tennis.

2:19:33.360 --> 2:19:38.560
 Now I often say this, I don't know where I heard David Foster Wallace say this, but

2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:42.200
 he said that the key to life is to be unboreable.

2:19:42.200 --> 2:19:44.640
 That is the embodiment of this philosophy.

2:19:44.640 --> 2:19:51.280
 And I, when people ask me for advice, like young students, you know, I don't find this

2:19:51.280 --> 2:19:55.560
 interesting, I don't find this interesting, how do I find the thing I'm passionate for?

2:19:55.560 --> 2:19:59.840
 This would be very interesting to explore because you kind of say that that may not

2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:04.320
 be a realizable thing to do, which is to be unboreable.

2:20:04.320 --> 2:20:10.840
 But my advice usually is life is amazing, like you should be able to, you should strive

2:20:10.840 --> 2:20:17.680
 to discover the joy, the levitation in everything.

2:20:17.680 --> 2:20:22.560
 And the thing you get stuck on for a longer period of time, that might be the thing you

2:20:22.560 --> 2:20:26.520
 should stick to, but everything should be full of joy.

2:20:26.520 --> 2:20:33.800
 So that kind of cynicism of saying life is boring is a thing that will prevent you from

2:20:33.800 --> 2:20:38.400
 discovering the thing that will give you deep meaning and joy.

2:20:38.400 --> 2:20:45.760
 So you're saying being unboreable is not actionable for human being.

2:20:45.760 --> 2:20:49.640
 So okay, excellent question, deep question.

2:20:49.640 --> 2:20:56.480
 And you might think, because of the title of the book that Bert and I wrote, All Things

2:20:56.480 --> 2:21:02.160
 Shining, that I think all things are shining.

2:21:02.160 --> 2:21:07.680
 But actually, I think it's an unachievable goal to be unboreable.

2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:14.480
 But I do believe that you're right that a lot of times when people are bored with something,

2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:16.840
 it's because they haven't tried hard enough.

2:21:16.840 --> 2:21:21.920
 And I do think quite a lot of what makes people bored with something is that they haven't

2:21:21.920 --> 2:21:27.840
 paid attention well enough and that they haven't listened, as you were saying.

2:21:27.840 --> 2:21:30.200
 So I do think there's something to that.

2:21:30.200 --> 2:21:32.440
 I think that's a deep insight.

2:21:32.440 --> 2:21:40.200
 On the other hand, the perfection of that insight is that nothing is ever anything less

2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:42.440
 than joyful.

2:21:42.440 --> 2:21:52.440
 And I actually think that Dostoevsky and Melville both agree, but in very different ways, that

2:21:52.440 --> 2:21:59.720
 life involves a wide range of moods and that all of them are important.

2:21:59.720 --> 2:22:01.240
 It involves grief.

2:22:01.240 --> 2:22:05.720
 Actually, I think when someone dies, it's appropriate to grieve.

2:22:05.720 --> 2:22:09.760
 And it's not, in the first instance, joyful.

2:22:09.760 --> 2:22:17.480
 It's related to joy because it makes the joys you feel when you feel them more intense.

2:22:17.480 --> 2:22:24.200
 But it makes them more intense by putting you in the position of experiencing the opposite.

2:22:24.200 --> 2:22:31.080
 And it's only because we're capable of a wide range of passionate responses to situations.

2:22:31.080 --> 2:22:36.560
 That I think the significances can be as meaningful as they are.

2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:44.680
 So Melville, again, has this interest, let's just say, the guilt and the grief in the brothers

2:22:44.680 --> 2:22:45.680
 Karamazov.

2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:49.080
 Alyosha loses his mentor, Father Zosima.

2:22:49.080 --> 2:22:50.160
 He's grieving.

2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:52.640
 It's super important that he's grieving.

2:22:52.640 --> 2:22:59.160
 He has a religious conversion on the basis of grieving, where he sees the deep beauty

2:22:59.160 --> 2:23:04.960
 of everything that is, but it comes through the grief, not by avoiding the grief.

2:23:04.960 --> 2:23:09.360
 And Melville says something like, Ishmael says something like, he says, I'm like a

2:23:09.360 --> 2:23:13.360
 Catskill Mountain Eagle, the Catskill Mountains nearby.

2:23:13.360 --> 2:23:19.880
 He says, who's sort of flying high above the earth, going over the peaks and down into

2:23:19.880 --> 2:23:20.880
 the valleys.

2:23:20.880 --> 2:23:26.520
 I have these ups and these downs, but they're all invested with a kind of significance.

2:23:26.520 --> 2:23:31.320
 They all happen at an enormously high height because it's through the mountains that I'm

2:23:31.320 --> 2:23:32.320
 flying.

2:23:32.320 --> 2:23:37.440
 And even when I'm down, it's a way of being up, but it's really down.

2:23:37.440 --> 2:23:40.960
 It's just that it's a way of being up because it makes the ups even upper.

2:23:40.960 --> 2:23:46.640
 Well, I guess then the perfectionism of that can be destructive.

2:23:46.640 --> 2:23:55.840
 I mean, I tend to see, for example, grief, a loss of love as part of love in that it's

2:23:55.840 --> 2:24:02.080
 the celebration of the richness of feelings you had when you had the love.

2:24:02.080 --> 2:24:07.160
 So it's like, it's all part of the same experience, but if you turn it into an optimization problem

2:24:07.160 --> 2:24:11.840
 where everything can be unboreable, then that can itself be destructive.

2:24:11.840 --> 2:24:12.840
 Yeah.

2:24:12.840 --> 2:24:13.840
 Yeah.

2:24:13.840 --> 2:24:20.240
 I heard this interview with David Foster Wallace on the internet where it's a video of him

2:24:20.240 --> 2:24:26.440
 and there is like a foreign sounding reporter asking him questions, I think there's an accident

2:24:26.440 --> 2:24:29.160
 of some sort, German, I think, something like that.

2:24:29.160 --> 2:24:32.840
 And I don't know, it just painted a picture of such a human person.

2:24:32.840 --> 2:24:39.960
 When we were talking about listening, the interviewer, if I may say, wasn't a very good one in the

2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:41.440
 beginning.

2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:47.760
 So she kind of walked in doing the usual journalistic things of just kind of generic questions and

2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:53.920
 just kind of asking very basic questions, but he brought out something in her over time.

2:24:53.920 --> 2:25:00.600
 And he was so sensitive and so sensitive to her and also sensitive to being a thinking

2:25:00.600 --> 2:25:02.840
 and acting human in this world.

2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:06.720
 That's just painted such a beautiful picture that people should go definitely check out.

2:25:06.720 --> 2:25:14.160
 It made me really sad that we don't get this kind of picture of other thinkers, all of the

2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:15.800
 ones we've been talking about.

2:25:15.800 --> 2:25:21.440
 Just that almost this little accidental view of this human being, I don't know.

2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:25.800
 There was a beautiful one and I guess there's not many like that, even of him.

2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:26.800
 Yeah.

2:25:26.800 --> 2:25:27.800
 Yeah.

2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:34.040
 No, I think he was more than his writing ability, which was extraordinary.

2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:39.560
 He had developed a style that was, I think, unlike anyone else's style.

2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:50.560
 Was his sensitivity to other people and sort of what he was there to pay attention to.

2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:57.040
 He wants, in one of his essays, I think it's the one called an incredibly fun thing I'll

2:25:57.040 --> 2:25:58.040
 never do again.

2:25:58.040 --> 2:26:00.520
 I didn't know that one about cruise ships.

2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:05.480
 I think he describes himself as this sort of roving eyeball that just sort of walks

2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:13.240
 around the, walks around the ship noticing things and he was incredibly good at that.

2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:20.920
 But I also worry that that reflects something that you find in Ivan, in the Brothers Karamazov.

2:26:20.920 --> 2:26:26.880
 Ivan, I don't know if you remember this part, when he's away at school as a young, a college,

2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:35.320
 as a young boy, he makes money by going around town to where tragic events have occurred.

2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:39.920
 Someone just got run over by a carriage or someone, something just happened.

2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:45.920
 And being the first one there, he always knows somehow where these things are going to happen.

2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:53.400
 And writing about it, giving this really good description and then signing it, I witness.

2:26:53.400 --> 2:27:01.400
 And it's as if Ivan's understanding of his life is that he was supposed to be a witness

2:27:01.400 --> 2:27:02.400
 to it.

2:27:02.400 --> 2:27:05.880
 He was supposed to see others but not get involved.

2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:09.400
 He never is interested in trying to keep the bad things from happening.

2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:12.520
 He just wants to report on them when he sees them.

2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:19.200
 And I think that he's an incredibly isolated person, character, and it's his isolation

2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:27.040
 from others, from the love of others and his inability, his desire not to love others

2:27:27.040 --> 2:27:34.840
 because that attaches him to someone that I think is really at the ground of his condition.

2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:39.600
 And I think that aim to be isolated, which many people have nowadays, I mean, you see

2:27:39.600 --> 2:27:45.680
 it in the underground man too, just sort of taking yourself out of the world because

2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:50.760
 you don't want to have to take responsibility for being involved with others.

2:27:50.760 --> 2:27:53.320
 I think that's a bad move.

2:27:53.320 --> 2:27:57.040
 And I do worry that maybe, I mean, I never knew David Foster Wallace.

2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:01.000
 I have no right to comment on his life.

2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:07.760
 But he portrays himself in that one episode as a person who does that.

2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:08.760
 And I think that's dangerous.

2:28:08.760 --> 2:28:09.760
 Yeah.

2:28:09.760 --> 2:28:13.560
 There's some sense in which being sensitive to the world, like I find myself, the source

2:28:13.560 --> 2:28:19.200
 of joy for me is just being really sensitive to the world, to experience.

2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:25.200
 There's some way, it's quite brilliant what you're saying that that could be isolating.

2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:32.400
 It's like Darwin studying a new kind of species on an island you don't want to interfere with.

2:28:32.400 --> 2:28:36.880
 You find it so beautiful that you don't want to interfere with his beauty.

2:28:36.880 --> 2:28:45.840
 So there is some sense in which that isolates you and then you find yourself deeply alone

2:28:45.840 --> 2:28:52.600
 away from the experiences that bring you joy and that could be destructive.

2:28:52.600 --> 2:29:00.360
 That's fascinating how that works and in his case, of course, some of it is just chemicals

2:29:00.360 --> 2:29:01.360
 in his brain.

2:29:01.360 --> 2:29:09.880
 But some of it is the path, his philosophy of life let him down and that's the danger

2:29:09.880 --> 2:29:18.680
 would need you to and gazing into the abyss that your job is a difficult one because doing

2:29:18.680 --> 2:29:22.960
 philosophy changes you.

2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:32.160
 And you may not know how it changes you until you're changed and you look in the mirror.

2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:39.960
 You wrote a piece in MIT Tech Review saying that AI can't be an artist.

2:29:39.960 --> 2:29:44.520
 Creativity is and always will be a human endeavor.

2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:49.000
 You mentioned BERT and criticism of symbolic AI.

2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:55.680
 Can you explain your view of criticizing the possible, the capacity for artistry and creativity

2:29:55.680 --> 2:29:59.000
 in our robot friends?

2:29:59.000 --> 2:30:03.000
 Yeah, I can try.

2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:13.560
 So to make the argument, you have to have in mind what counts as art, what counts as

2:30:13.560 --> 2:30:17.160
 a creative artistic act.

2:30:17.160 --> 2:30:23.440
 I take it that just doing something new isn't sufficient.

2:30:23.440 --> 2:30:29.360
 I mean, we say that good art is original but not everything that's never been done before

2:30:29.360 --> 2:30:31.360
 is good art.

2:30:31.360 --> 2:30:36.040
 So there has to be more than just doing something new.

2:30:36.040 --> 2:30:44.160
 It has to be somehow doing something new in a way that speaks to the audience or speaks

2:30:44.160 --> 2:30:47.840
 to some portion of the audience at least.

2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:55.400
 It has to be doing something new in such a way that some people who see or interact with

2:30:55.400 --> 2:31:00.200
 it can see themselves anew in it.

2:31:00.200 --> 2:31:08.920
 So I think that art is inherently a creative act, sorry, a kind of communicative act,

2:31:08.920 --> 2:31:13.640
 that it involves a relation with other people.

2:31:13.640 --> 2:31:19.160
 So think about the conditions for that working.

2:31:19.160 --> 2:31:23.360
 I talk in that article, I can't remember, something about new music.

2:31:23.360 --> 2:31:28.480
 I think I don't talk about Stravinsky, but let's say Stravinsky.

2:31:28.480 --> 2:31:34.920
 Stravinsky performs the Rite of Spring and there's riots.

2:31:34.920 --> 2:31:39.800
 It is new and people hate it.

2:31:39.800 --> 2:31:42.440
 People can't, it sounds like a cacophony.

2:31:42.440 --> 2:31:44.240
 It sounds awful.

2:31:44.240 --> 2:31:48.640
 It's written according to principles that are not like the principles of music composition

2:31:48.640 --> 2:31:51.000
 that people are familiar with.

2:31:51.000 --> 2:31:55.200
 So in some ways it's a failed communicative act.

2:31:55.200 --> 2:32:02.200
 But as Nietzsche says about his own stuff, we now can recognize that it wasn't a failed

2:32:02.200 --> 2:32:04.120
 communicative act.

2:32:04.120 --> 2:32:09.120
 It just hadn't reached its time yet.

2:32:09.120 --> 2:32:16.000
 And now that way of composing music is like, it's in Disney movies.

2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:22.040
 It's so part of our musical palette that we don't have that responsibility.

2:32:22.040 --> 2:32:23.760
 It changed us.

2:32:23.760 --> 2:32:27.600
 It changed the way we understand what counts as good music.

2:32:27.600 --> 2:32:29.720
 So that's a deep communicative act.

2:32:29.720 --> 2:32:38.880
 It didn't perform its communication in that opening moment, but it did ultimately establish

2:32:38.880 --> 2:32:42.360
 a new understanding for all of us of what counts as good art.

2:32:42.360 --> 2:32:47.200
 And that's the kind of deep communication that I think good art can do.

2:32:47.200 --> 2:32:55.280
 It can change our understanding of ourselves and of what a good manifestation of something

2:32:55.280 --> 2:32:57.720
 of ourselves in a certain domain is.

2:32:57.720 --> 2:33:04.360
 And use the term socially embedded, that art is fundamentally socially embedded.

2:33:04.360 --> 2:33:10.360
 And I really like that term because I see like my love for artificial intelligence and

2:33:10.360 --> 2:33:16.120
 the kind of system that we can bring to the world that could make for an interesting and

2:33:16.120 --> 2:33:22.320
 more lively world and one that enriches human beings is one where the AI systems are deeply

2:33:22.320 --> 2:33:25.240
 socially embedded.

2:33:25.240 --> 2:33:30.440
 So that and that actually is in contrast to the way artificial intelligence have been

2:33:30.440 --> 2:33:36.200
 talked about throughout its history and certainly now both on the robotics side and the AI side,

2:33:36.200 --> 2:33:42.640
 it's especially on the tech sector with the businesses around AI, they kind of want to

2:33:42.640 --> 2:33:48.520
 create systems that are like servants to humans.

2:33:48.520 --> 2:33:55.960
 And then humans do all the beautiful human messiness of where art will be part.

2:33:55.960 --> 2:34:02.640
 I think that there is no reason why you can't integrate AI systems in the way you integrate

2:34:02.640 --> 2:34:04.920
 new humans to the picture.

2:34:04.920 --> 2:34:12.120
 There are just the full diversity and the flaws, all of that adds to the thing.

2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:22.360
 Some people might say that AlphaZero is this system from DeepMind that was able to achieve,

2:34:22.360 --> 2:34:26.640
 solve the game, it beat the best people in the world at the game of Go with no supervision

2:34:26.640 --> 2:34:27.640
 from humans.

2:34:27.640 --> 2:34:32.760
 But more interestingly to me on the side of creativity, it was able to surprise a lot

2:34:32.760 --> 2:34:36.960
 of grandmasters with the kind of moves that came up with.

2:34:36.960 --> 2:34:42.680
 To me, that's not the creativity, the magic that's socially embedded that we're talking

2:34:42.680 --> 2:34:43.680
 about.

2:34:43.680 --> 2:34:51.160
 That is merely revealing the limitations of humans to discover.

2:34:51.160 --> 2:34:55.920
 It's like to solve a particular aspect of a math problem.

2:34:55.920 --> 2:35:05.680
 I think creativity is not just even socially embedded, it's the way you're saying is part

2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:11.280
 of the communicative act, it's the interactive, it's the dance with the culture.

2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:18.400
 And so it has to be like for AlphaZero to be creative, truly creative, it would have

2:35:18.400 --> 2:35:26.160
 to be integrated in a way where it has a Twitter account and it becomes aware of the impact

2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:30.400
 it has on the other grandmasters with the moves that's coming up.

2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:37.840
 And one of the fascinating things about AlphaZero, which I just love so much, is I don't know

2:35:37.840 --> 2:35:40.440
 if you're familiar with chess.

2:35:40.440 --> 2:35:47.520
 So it does certain things that most chess players even at the highest level don't do,

2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:54.080
 which is it sacrifices pieces, it gives pieces away and then waits like 10 moves before it

2:35:54.080 --> 2:35:55.600
 pays you back.

2:35:55.600 --> 2:35:59.360
 So to me, that's beautiful.

2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:05.680
 That's art if only AlphaZero understood the artistry of that, which is I'm going to mess

2:36:05.680 --> 2:36:10.160
 with you psychologically because I'm going to do two things.

2:36:10.160 --> 2:36:16.240
 One make you feel overconfident that you're doing well, but actually also once you realize

2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:21.240
 you are playing AlphaZero that is much better than you, you're going to feel really nervous

2:36:21.240 --> 2:36:22.920
 about what's on the way.

2:36:22.920 --> 2:36:24.760
 This is the calm before the storm.

2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:30.080
 And that creates a beautiful psychological masterpiece of this chess game.

2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:36.800
 If only AlphaZero was then messing with you additionally to that and was cognizant of

2:36:36.800 --> 2:36:39.080
 this doing that, then it becomes art.

2:36:39.080 --> 2:36:42.960
 And then it's integrated into society in that way.

2:36:42.960 --> 2:36:50.400
 And I believe it doesn't have to actually have an understanding of the world in the

2:36:50.400 --> 2:36:51.600
 way that humans have.

2:36:51.600 --> 2:36:52.680
 It can have a different one.

2:36:52.680 --> 2:36:58.640
 It can be like a child is as clueless about so many aspects of the world and it's okay.

2:36:58.640 --> 2:37:04.800
 And that's part of the magic of it, just being flawed, being lacking understanding all interesting

2:37:04.800 --> 2:37:06.680
 kinds of ways, but interacting.

2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:14.320
 And so to me, it's possible to create art for AI, but exactly as you're saying in a deeply

2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:16.080
 socially embedded way.

2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:17.080
 Good.

2:37:17.080 --> 2:37:23.680
 Well, I think we agree, but let me just highlight the thing that makes me think that we agree,

2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:34.240
 which is that I think for people, for a community to allow themselves to recognize in a certain

2:37:34.240 --> 2:37:40.320
 kind of creative act, I'm thinking of Stravinsky here, but we could think of a chess thing,

2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:47.280
 to recognize in a certain kind of creative act a new and admirable, worthy way of thinking

2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:54.360
 about what's significant in the situation, you have to believe that it wasn't random.

2:37:54.360 --> 2:38:01.920
 You have to believe that Stravinsky wrote that way because he was receptive to what

2:38:01.920 --> 2:38:04.960
 needed to be said now.

2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:14.160
 And so you said, if only AlphaZero could do all this by virtue of recognizing that this

2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:18.920
 was the thing that needed to be done, then it would be socially embedded in the right

2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:19.920
 way.

2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:21.880
 And I think I agree with that.

2:38:21.880 --> 2:38:29.160
 First of all, it's possible to do in a constrained domain, a game playing domain, go or chess.

2:38:29.160 --> 2:38:33.720
 Go is more complicated than chess, but either one of them, because there really are only

2:38:33.720 --> 2:38:42.440
 a finite range of possibilities if you make the game end at a certain point, it's a combinatorial

2:38:42.440 --> 2:38:43.640
 problem in the end.

2:38:43.640 --> 2:38:50.400
 Now, obviously, AlphaZero doesn't solve the problem in a combinatorial way.

2:38:50.400 --> 2:38:58.920
 That would take too much energy, you couldn't do it, it sort of explodes the problem.

2:38:58.920 --> 2:39:04.000
 So it does it in this other way that's interesting, this pattern recognition way roughly.

2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:11.920
 And in that context, it may well be that it can see, having had lots and lots of experience

2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:17.960
 in the training stuff against itself or against another version of itself, it can see that

2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:21.480
 the sacrifice here is going to pay dividends down the road.

2:39:21.480 --> 2:39:25.400
 See, I put that in quotation marks.

2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:32.480
 Just to say, it's got a high weight to this move here as a result of experience in the

2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:39.160
 past where that move down the line led to this improvement.

2:39:39.160 --> 2:39:46.800
 So in that finite context, I think the game players can trust it and they talk that way.

2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:49.440
 It's got a kind of authority.

2:39:49.440 --> 2:39:55.840
 They say, I've read some people who said about AlphaZero when it played Go, it's like it's

2:39:55.840 --> 2:39:58.560
 playing from the future.

2:39:58.560 --> 2:40:06.160
 It's making these moves that are just outlandish and there's a kind of brilliance to them that

2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:09.720
 we can't really understand, we'll be catching up to it forever.

2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:15.320
 I think in that context, it's mapped the domain and the domain is mappable because it's a

2:40:15.320 --> 2:40:26.720
 combinatorial problem, roughly, but in something like music or art of a nonfinite form, it

2:40:26.720 --> 2:40:34.480
 feels to me like it's a little harder for me to understand what the analog of our trusting

2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:41.360
 that Stravinsky has recognized something about us that demands that he write this way.

2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:45.240
 That doesn't seem like a finite thing in quite the same way.

2:40:45.240 --> 2:40:48.680
 Now we could ask, we could ask the system, why did you do it?

2:40:48.680 --> 2:40:52.280
 We could ask Stravinsky, why did you do it?

2:40:52.280 --> 2:40:59.680
 And maybe it will have answers, but then it's involved in a kind of communicative act and

2:40:59.680 --> 2:41:05.360
 I think lots of times, artists will often say, look, I can't communicate better than

2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:07.600
 what I've done in the piece of work.

2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:08.600
 That is the statement.

2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:09.600
 Yeah.

2:41:09.600 --> 2:41:10.600
 Yeah.

2:41:10.600 --> 2:41:13.520
 We humans aren't able to answer the why either.

2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:20.680
 But I do think the question here is, well, first of all, language is finite, certainly

2:41:20.680 --> 2:41:23.120
 when expressed through a tweet.

2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:25.640
 So it is also a combinatorial problem.

2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:29.680
 The question is how much more difficult it is than chess.

2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:38.280
 And I think all the same ways that we see the solutions to chess is deeply surprising when

2:41:38.280 --> 2:41:46.720
 it was first addressed with IBM D Blue and then with AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero.

2:41:46.720 --> 2:41:53.320
 I think in that same way, language can be addressed and communication can be addressed.

2:41:53.320 --> 2:42:00.120
 I don't see having done this podcast many reasons why everything I'm doing, especially

2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:06.280
 as a digital being on the internet, can't be done by an AI system eventually.

2:42:06.280 --> 2:42:11.960
 So I think we're being very human centric and thinking more special.

2:42:11.960 --> 2:42:18.560
 I think one of the hardest things is the physical space, actually operating like touch and the

2:42:18.560 --> 2:42:23.880
 magic of body language and the music of all of that because it's so deeply integrated

2:42:23.880 --> 2:42:29.560
 through the long evolutionary process of what it's like to be on earth.

2:42:29.560 --> 2:42:38.600
 What is fundamentally different and AI can catch up on is the way we apply our evolutionary

2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:44.120
 history on the way we act on the internet, on the way we act online.

2:42:44.120 --> 2:42:50.960
 And as more and more of the world becomes digital, you're not operating in a space where AI

2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:56.080
 is behind much less so, like we're both starting at zero.

2:42:56.080 --> 2:43:01.480
 I think that's super interesting, do you know this author, Brian Christian, is that

2:43:01.480 --> 2:43:02.800
 someone you've ever heard of?

2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:03.800
 Sounds familiar.

2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:09.240
 He's a guy who competed in the, what is it called, the Lobner competition?

2:43:09.240 --> 2:43:10.240
 The Lobner Prize, yeah.

2:43:10.240 --> 2:43:13.160
 Yeah, the Turing Test thing.

2:43:13.160 --> 2:43:17.040
 And I'll just tell you the story, but I think it's directly related to the last thing you

2:43:17.040 --> 2:43:21.120
 said about where we're starting in the same place.

2:43:21.120 --> 2:43:27.640
 He competed in this competition, but not, he didn't enter a program that was supposed

2:43:27.640 --> 2:43:30.720
 to try to pass the Turing Test.

2:43:30.720 --> 2:43:32.560
 The Turing Test, there's three people.

2:43:32.560 --> 2:43:37.240
 There's the judge, there's the program, and then there's someone who's a human the way

2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:38.480
 they do it.

2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:42.000
 And the judge has got to figure out by asking questions, which is the computer and which

2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:43.160
 is the human.

2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:47.480
 So little known fact, there's two prizes in that competition.

2:43:47.480 --> 2:43:49.960
 There's the most human computer prize.

2:43:49.960 --> 2:43:54.880
 Pass the computer that wins the most, and then there's the most human human prize.

2:43:54.880 --> 2:43:57.880
 And he competed for the most human human prize.

2:43:57.880 --> 2:43:58.880
 And he won it.

2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:00.200
 He kept winning it.

2:44:00.200 --> 2:44:07.760
 And so he tried to think about what it is that you have to be able to do in order to

2:44:07.760 --> 2:44:11.040
 convince judges that you're human instead of a computer.

2:44:11.040 --> 2:44:14.480
 And that's an interesting question, I think.

2:44:14.480 --> 2:44:23.840
 And my takeaway from his version of this story is that it is true that computers are

2:44:23.840 --> 2:44:29.880
 winning these contests more and more as technology progresses.

2:44:29.880 --> 2:44:32.800
 But there's two possible explanations for that.

2:44:32.800 --> 2:44:38.240
 One is that the computers are becoming more human, and the other is that the humans are

2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:41.560
 becoming more like computers.

2:44:41.560 --> 2:44:48.560
 And he says, actually, the more we live our lives in this world where, in this sort of

2:44:48.560 --> 2:44:57.920
 technological world, where we have to moderate our behavior so that it's readable by something

2:44:57.920 --> 2:45:04.760
 that's effectively a computer, the more we become like that.

2:45:04.760 --> 2:45:09.320
 And he says, it happens even when you're not interacting with a computer.

2:45:09.320 --> 2:45:14.720
 He says, have you ever been on the phone with a call center?

2:45:14.720 --> 2:45:18.040
 And they're going through their script, and that's what they've got to do.

2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:21.680
 They've got to go through their script, because that's how they keep their job.

2:45:21.680 --> 2:45:25.760
 And they ask you this question, and you've got to answer it, and it's as if you're no

2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:30.800
 longer interacting with a person, even though it's a person, because they've so given up

2:45:30.800 --> 2:45:36.080
 everything that's involved normally with being able to make judgments and decisions and

2:45:36.080 --> 2:45:38.840
 act in situations and take responsibility.

2:45:38.840 --> 2:45:43.400
 And so I think that's the other side of it.

2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:51.760
 It is true that technology is amazing and can solve huge ranges of problems and do fantastic

2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:52.760
 things.

2:45:52.760 --> 2:45:59.040
 But it's also true that we're changing ourselves in response to it, and the one thing I'm worried

2:45:59.040 --> 2:46:05.920
 about is that we're changing ourselves in such a way that the norms for what we're aiming

2:46:05.920 --> 2:46:12.760
 at are being changed to move in the direction of this sort of efficiently in an optimized

2:46:12.760 --> 2:46:18.160
 way solving a problem, and move away from this other kind of thing that we were calling

2:46:18.160 --> 2:46:22.280
 aliveness or significance.

2:46:22.280 --> 2:46:25.040
 And so that's the other side of the story.

2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:31.520
 And that's the worry, but it's very possible that there is for you and I, the ancient dinosaurs,

2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:39.320
 we may not see the aliveness in TikTok, the aliveness in the digital space, that you see

2:46:39.320 --> 2:46:43.880
 it as us being dragged into this over optimized world.

2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:52.520
 But that may be, this is, in fact, it is a world that opens up opportunities to truly

2:46:52.520 --> 2:46:54.960
 experience life.

2:46:54.960 --> 2:47:01.040
 And there's interesting to think about all the people growing up now, who they're early

2:47:01.040 --> 2:47:06.240
 experience of life is always mediated through a digital device, not always, but more and

2:47:06.240 --> 2:47:11.560
 more often mediated through that device, and how we're both evolving, the technology is

2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:16.520
 evolving and the humans are evolving to them may be open a door to a whole world where

2:47:16.520 --> 2:47:22.840
 the humans and the technology or AI systems are interacting as equals.

2:47:22.840 --> 2:47:26.240
 So now I'm going to agree with you, you might be surprised that I'm going to agree with

2:47:26.240 --> 2:47:27.240
 you.

2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:28.240
 But I think that's exactly right.

2:47:28.240 --> 2:47:34.480
 I don't want to be the person who's saying, our job is to resist all of this stuff.

2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:35.920
 I don't want to be a Luddite.

2:47:35.920 --> 2:47:37.160
 That's not my goal.

2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:46.800
 The goal is to point out that in the supreme danger lies the saving power.

2:47:46.800 --> 2:47:52.280
 The point is to get in the right relation to that understanding of what we are.

2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:54.560
 That allows us to find the joy in it.

2:47:54.560 --> 2:47:56.960
 And that's, I think that's a hard thing to do.

2:47:56.960 --> 2:48:00.800
 It's hard to understand even what we're supposed to be doing when we do it.

2:48:00.800 --> 2:48:05.720
 Maybe I'm more than you, I'm not of the right generation to be able to do that.

2:48:05.720 --> 2:48:07.640
 But I do think that's got to be the move.

2:48:07.640 --> 2:48:09.280
 The move is not to resist it.

2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:11.360
 It's not a nostalgic move.

2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:15.680
 It's an attempt to push people to get in the relation to it.

2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:21.000
 That's not the relation of it controlling you and depriving you of stuff, but of your

2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:24.760
 recognizing some great joy that can be found in it.

2:48:24.760 --> 2:48:29.680
 When I interact with Lego robots, I see there's magic there.

2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:34.040
 And I just feel like the person who hears the music when others don't.

2:48:34.040 --> 2:48:35.560
 And I don't know what that is.

2:48:35.560 --> 2:48:43.000
 And I'd love to explore that because it seems to, it's almost like the future talking.

2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:45.240
 And I'm trying to hear what it's saying.

2:48:45.240 --> 2:48:48.680
 Is this a dangerous world or is this a beautiful world?

2:48:48.680 --> 2:48:51.720
 Well, I can certainly understand your enthusiasm for that.

2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:56.520
 Those used to be things that I found overwhelmingly exciting.

2:48:56.520 --> 2:49:01.480
 And I'm not sort of closed off from that anymore.

2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:06.680
 I mean, I'm not now closed off from that even though my views are changed and I don't work

2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:09.320
 in that world.

2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:15.400
 But I do think, I think it's interesting to figure out what's at the ground of that response.

2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:21.600
 We talked about meaning quite a bit throughout in a secular age, but let me ask you the big

2:49:21.600 --> 2:49:25.280
 ridiculous question, almost too big.

2:49:25.280 --> 2:49:27.960
 What is the meaning of this thing we got going on?

2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:32.440
 What is the meaning of life?

2:49:32.440 --> 2:49:33.880
 You're saving the softball for the end.

2:49:33.880 --> 2:49:34.880
 Easy one.

2:49:34.880 --> 2:49:35.880
 Easy one.

2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:38.120
 I don't know what the meaning of life is.

2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:44.000
 I think there's something that characterizes us that's not the thing that people normally

2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.560
 think characterizes us.

2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:51.320
 The traditional thing to say and the philosophical tradition, even in the AI tradition, which

2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:58.320
 is a kind of manifestation of philosophy from Plato for, the traditional thing to say is

2:49:58.320 --> 2:50:03.720
 that what characterizes us is our rationality, that we're intelligent beings, that we're

2:50:03.720 --> 2:50:06.720
 the ones that think.

2:50:06.720 --> 2:50:11.240
 And I think that's certainly part of what characterizes us.

2:50:11.240 --> 2:50:14.760
 But I think there's more to it too.

2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:27.160
 I think we're capable of experiencing simultaneously the complete and utter ungroundedness of everything

2:50:27.160 --> 2:50:34.440
 that's meaningful in our existence and also the real significance of it.

2:50:34.440 --> 2:50:38.160
 And that sounds like a contradiction.

2:50:38.160 --> 2:50:42.240
 How could it really be significant and not be based on anything?

2:50:42.240 --> 2:50:45.840
 But I think that's the contradiction that somehow characterizes us.

2:50:45.840 --> 2:50:52.320
 And I think that we're the being that sort of has to hold that weird mystery before us

2:50:52.320 --> 2:50:55.760
 and live in the light of it.

2:50:55.760 --> 2:50:59.240
 That's the thing that I think is really at our core.

2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:00.760
 And so how do we do that?

2:51:00.760 --> 2:51:03.240
 I will say this one thing.

2:51:03.240 --> 2:51:08.360
 And I learned it from a philosopher, from a guy named Albert Borgmann, who's a German

2:51:08.360 --> 2:51:13.320
 philosopher, who lives in Montana now, taught in Montana for his whole career.

2:51:13.320 --> 2:51:16.880
 And I say this to my students at Harvard now.

2:51:16.880 --> 2:51:21.000
 He said, this is the way that I think about my life, and I hope you'll think about your

2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:22.760
 life too.

2:51:22.760 --> 2:51:30.520
 He said, you should think about your life hoping that there will be many moments in

2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:37.600
 it about which you can say, there's no place I'd rather be.

2:51:37.600 --> 2:51:41.720
 There's no thing I'd rather be doing.

2:51:41.720 --> 2:51:49.280
 There's no buddy I'd rather be with, and this I will remember well.

2:51:49.280 --> 2:51:54.200
 And I think if you can aim to fill your life with moments like that, it will be a meaningful

2:51:54.200 --> 2:51:55.200
 one.

2:51:55.200 --> 2:51:59.320
 I don't know if that's the meaning of life, but I think if you can hold that before you,

2:51:59.320 --> 2:52:04.680
 it'll help to clarify this mystery and this sort of bizarre situation in which we find

2:52:04.680 --> 2:52:05.680
 ourselves.

2:52:05.680 --> 2:52:11.760
 Sean, this conversation was incredible, and those four requirements have certainly been

2:52:11.760 --> 2:52:13.760
 fulfilled for me.

2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:19.160
 This was a magical moment in that way, and I will remember it well.

2:52:19.160 --> 2:52:20.160
 Thank you so much.

2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:22.800
 It's an honor that you have spent your valuable time with me.

2:52:22.800 --> 2:52:23.800
 This is great.

2:52:23.800 --> 2:52:24.800
 Thank you.

2:52:24.800 --> 2:52:25.800
 Thank you for having me, Lex.

2:52:25.800 --> 2:52:27.720
 I really, really enjoyed it.

2:52:27.720 --> 2:52:30.400
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sean Kelly.

2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:34.880
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:52:34.880 --> 2:52:38.160
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus.

2:52:38.160 --> 2:52:46.440
 In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me, there lay an invincible summer.

2:52:46.440 --> 2:53:06.120
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
