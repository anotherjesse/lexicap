00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
 The following is a conversation with Steven Pressfield,

00:03.040 --> 00:07.600
 author of several powerful nonfiction and historical fiction books,

00:07.600 --> 00:12.960
 including The War of Art, a book that had a big impact on my life

00:12.960 --> 00:17.440
 and the life of millions of people whose passion is to create

00:17.440 --> 00:22.640
 an art, science, business, sport, and everywhere else.

00:22.640 --> 00:26.800
 I highly recommend it and others of his books on this topic,

00:26.800 --> 00:33.120
 including Turning Pro, Do the Work, Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit,

00:33.120 --> 00:37.360
 and The Warrior Ethos. Also, his books Gets a Fire

00:37.360 --> 00:40.240
 about the Spartans and the Battle of Thermopylae,

00:40.240 --> 00:45.440
 The Lionsgate, Ties of War, and others are some of the best historical fiction

00:45.440 --> 00:51.040
 novels ever written. Some of you know I don't shy away from

00:51.040 --> 00:54.960
 taking on a big difficult challenge. One of the hardest for me

00:54.960 --> 01:00.240
 and for millions of others is the discipline of staring at an empty page

01:00.240 --> 01:04.720
 every day, pushing on to think deeply to create

01:04.720 --> 01:08.320
 despite the millions of excuses that fill the head.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.680
 In his work, Steven has articulated this struggle

01:11.680 --> 01:17.840
 better than anyone I've ever read. Quick summary of the ads, two sponsors,

01:17.840 --> 01:23.120

 Click on the links by all of this stuff. It really is the best way to support

01:38.720 --> 01:42.640
 this podcast. This is the Artificial Intelligence

01:42.640 --> 01:46.240
 Podcast. I recently considered renaming this podcast

01:46.240 --> 01:50.160
 but decided against it. AI is my passion

01:50.160 --> 01:53.440
 and in some sense this podcast is not as much about AI

01:53.440 --> 01:56.800
 but more about a journey of an AI researcher struggling

01:56.800 --> 02:00.160
 to explore the human mind, the physics of our universe,

02:00.160 --> 02:03.280
 and the nature of human behavior, intelligence,

02:03.280 --> 02:08.800
 consciousness, love, and power. I will continue to return home to the

02:08.800 --> 02:12.800
 technical, computer science, machine learning, engineering, math, programming

02:12.800 --> 02:17.760
 but also venture out to talk to people who had a big impact on my life

02:17.760 --> 02:22.080
 outside the technical fields. Writers like Steven Pressfield

02:22.080 --> 02:29.440
 and Stephen King, musicians like Tom Waits, political leaders like

02:29.440 --> 02:35.920
 well you know who, and even athletes. I hope you join me on this journey.

02:35.920 --> 02:39.680
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and no ads in the middle that can

02:39.680 --> 02:44.400

 on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and everywhere else. I've been binging on this podcast.

03:02.800 --> 03:07.120
 Jordan is a great human being. He gets the best out of his guests,

03:07.120 --> 03:11.200
 dives deep, calls them out when it's needed, and makes the whole thing fun to

03:11.200 --> 03:15.200
 listen to. He's interviewed Kobe Bryant, Mark Cuban,

03:15.200 --> 03:18.800
 Neil deGrasse Tyson, Garrick Asparov, and many more.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.240
 I just finished listening to his recent conversation with Mick West

03:22.240 --> 03:27.120
 about debunking conspiracy theories. This topic can be both fascinating and

03:27.120 --> 03:31.200
 frustrating on both sides. But in this conversation,

03:31.200 --> 03:35.680
 Jordan thread the needle beautifully, and so it turned out to be a great listen.

03:35.680 --> 03:40.720
 I highly recommend it. Again, go to jordanharbinger.com slash lex.

03:40.720 --> 03:45.600
 It's how he knows I sent you. On that page, there's links to subscribe to the show,

03:45.600 --> 03:51.680

03:51.680 --> 03:57.200
 the number one finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use code Lex Podcast.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.000
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market

04:02.000 --> 04:06.320
 with as little as $1. Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,

04:06.320 --> 04:11.200
 when you mention that cryptocurrency in the context of the history of money, it's fascinating.

04:11.760 --> 04:15.920
 I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.

04:15.920 --> 04:22.720
 Debits and credits on ledgers started around 30,000 years ago. The US dollar created over 200

04:22.720 --> 04:27.600
 years ago, and the first decentralized cryptocurrency released just over 10 years ago.

04:28.160 --> 04:32.640
 So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development,

04:32.640 --> 04:37.600
 but it's still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.720
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code Lex Podcast,

04:44.720 --> 04:50.320
 you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to first, an organization that is helping

04:50.320 --> 04:53.840
 advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.

04:55.120 --> 04:59.120
 And now, here's my conversation with Steven Pressfield.

04:59.120 --> 05:04.960
 Steven, modern society in many ways dreams of creating universal peace,

05:06.160 --> 05:10.960
 and yet war has molded civilization as we know it throughout its history. So

05:13.040 --> 05:18.720
 let's start at the high philosophical level. If you could imagine a world without war,

05:18.720 --> 05:24.480
 how would that world be different? Perhaps put another way, what purpose has war served?

05:24.480 --> 05:31.040
 Why do we fight? I think we're basically the same creatures

05:31.040 --> 05:39.840
 internally that we were in the cave, in tribal society, back for however many hundreds of

05:39.840 --> 05:48.000
 thousands, millions of years, which means that the dynamic in our mind is a kind of an us versus

05:48.000 --> 05:56.800
 them dynamic where our tribe is the people and everybody else or whatever. And I don't see that.

05:56.800 --> 06:02.640
 I don't think that's changed one iota over the centuries. It's just a question of how

06:04.880 --> 06:13.760
 one might sublimate that urge to compete. You're a martial artist. A great part of your day,

06:13.760 --> 06:23.120
 I'm sure, is dedicated to reaching that place of total commitment and in the face of competition,

06:23.120 --> 06:28.800
 in the face of adversity, etc., etc., which is, I think, natural and great for the human race

06:28.800 --> 06:36.320
 on an individual basis. So the hope that I have, if there is any hope, personally, I don't think

06:36.320 --> 06:44.960
 the human race is going to be around very long, but would be in sports or in other kind of

06:45.600 --> 06:53.120
 sublimated activities where people can act out their need for conquest or aggression or so forth,

06:53.120 --> 06:57.760
 but at the same time relate to their opponents as human beings that when the game is over,

06:58.480 --> 07:05.440
 you embrace your competitor and stuff like that. So you think war was inevitable? It's a part of

07:05.440 --> 07:14.480
 human nature as opposed to a creative force in society that served the benefit? Well, I'm sure

07:14.480 --> 07:22.480
 it has benefited spreading cultures and mixing cultures and stuff like that. But I think the

07:24.320 --> 07:29.840
 urge to conquest, if you think about Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar or Napoleon or anybody

07:29.840 --> 07:34.880
 like that, or even individual, or if we even think about one of the plants that we're looking at

07:34.880 --> 07:40.400
 right outside, I mean, if you let a particular plant have its way, it would take over the whole

07:40.400 --> 07:49.200
 hillside. And certainly in the days of Alexander the Great, let's say, there were who knows over

07:49.200 --> 07:56.320
 the face of the earth, hundreds of little kingdoms, China, Japan, Asia, Europe, wherever,

07:56.320 --> 08:04.480
 and every prince that grew up dreamt of conquering his neighbor and conquering a neighbor after that.

08:04.480 --> 08:13.440
 That seems to be a universal human imperative, at least in the male of the species.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.440
 War is just the realization of that imperative. I think so.

08:18.080 --> 08:23.440
 So you've written about Spartans in the Battle of Thermopylae, about Alexander the Great,

08:23.440 --> 08:34.480
 about the 68 war in 67 in Israel against Egypt, Jordan, Syria. War not just out of those, but in

08:34.480 --> 08:37.920
 general, do you think has been most transformative for the world?

08:38.720 --> 08:42.400
 Well, these are great questions, Lex. Easy ones, right?

08:42.400 --> 08:49.520
 I mean, I wish I knew more about the Mongols, because I certainly from what little I know,

08:49.520 --> 08:57.120
 I think that was a very, their conquest was a very transformative, bringing cultures in

08:57.120 --> 09:04.240
 an horrible, bloody way together. But gosh, what's then the most transformative?

09:05.040 --> 09:10.560
 Maybe the Roman conquest, establishing the Roman Empire and bringing that culture.

09:10.560 --> 09:18.400
 Maybe Alexander the Great's wars that united east and west, at least for a minute.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.440
 All right. So building a vampire, do you have a sense?

09:22.480 --> 09:29.280
 So there's wars. I mean, the, the 68 war is not about building empires.

09:30.160 --> 09:41.360
 It's about deep held, deeply held religious, cultural conflict, and holding the line,

09:41.360 --> 09:47.360
 holding the border. And then there is conquest, like the Mongols, that what is it some large

09:47.360 --> 09:52.880
 percentage of the population is a descendant of Genghis Khan, I believe, right? So that has

09:52.880 --> 09:57.840
 transformative effects. And then World War II, I mean, personally in my family and so on,

09:57.840 --> 10:01.920
 the transformative effects. Let me ask you this, Lex, why are you,

10:01.920 --> 10:07.040
 what are you trying to get at with these questions? What is this kind of the theme that you're,

10:07.680 --> 10:12.080
 you're aiming at? Well, I talked to Eric Weinstein and he said,

10:12.080 --> 10:20.080
 everything is great about war except the killing. And there's a romantic notion of war.

10:21.520 --> 10:26.320
 Certainly there's a romantic notion of being a warrior, but there's a romantic notion of war

10:26.320 --> 10:34.800
 that somehow there's a creative force to it. That because we fight out of that fighting,

10:34.800 --> 10:44.880
 comes culture, comes music and art, and more and more desire to create with the societies that win.

10:45.680 --> 10:54.720
 And to me, war is not just, hey, I have a stick and I want your land. It's some kind of,

10:54.720 --> 11:05.440
 it has echoes of the creative force that makes humans unique to other animals.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.200
 It can't be just four people or 10 people or 100 people. You have to have thousands of people

11:13.200 --> 11:22.080
 agreeing, usually thousands or more, for something so deeply that you would be willing to risk your

11:22.080 --> 11:27.280
 own life. And there's a romantic notion to that. And because you've written so well and passionately

11:27.280 --> 11:32.880
 about some of these, I wanted to see, because I don't have any answers, I wanted to untangle that.

11:32.880 --> 11:43.120
 If there is a reason we fight, that's more than just anger and hate and wanting to conquer.

11:43.120 --> 11:49.360
 Well, let me take it from a completely different side. I don't think that I,

11:49.360 --> 11:57.120
 in writing about war, am really that interested in war per se. I'm more interested in the metaphor.

11:58.320 --> 12:06.240
 I think, for me, I'm really writing about my own internal war and the war against myself

12:06.800 --> 12:13.760
 and against my own resistance, my own negativity, all of those things that are,

12:13.760 --> 12:24.240
 that spirituality would be the opposite of. So, I'm not really an expert on war. It's not like

12:24.240 --> 12:38.400
 talking to Jim Mattis or to Victor Davis Hansen or whatever. To me, the human being, we are

12:38.400 --> 12:47.760
 spiritual beings in a physical envelope. And there's a automatic, terrible tension within that,

12:49.200 --> 12:58.000
 which creates a war inside ourselves. So, the outer war, when I think about the Israeli army

12:58.640 --> 13:06.400
 standing up to whatever, 10 to one odds or whatever it was, that is a metaphor to me

13:06.400 --> 13:11.840
 of the fight we're fighting inside ourselves. For me, the Six Day War was, as you know,

13:12.400 --> 13:19.360
 my feeling was it was about a return from exile. It was sort of the culmination of the reestablishment

13:19.360 --> 13:24.960
 of the state of Israel, which had never really been completed because the holiest places of the

13:24.960 --> 13:30.880
 Jewish people were in the hands of their enemies. So, now, on the other hand, Alexander the Great's

13:30.880 --> 13:37.680
 conquest, I think, were a whole other different scenario where the metaphor was that Alexander's

13:37.680 --> 13:45.520
 father, Philip, I think, created the first nation, capital N nation, and he created a sort of a pathway

13:46.160 --> 13:56.800
 for these guys who were mountain men and basically barbarians, Macedonians, and

13:56.800 --> 14:05.520
 and by creating this army and this dream of conquering the world, which Alexander took to the,

14:05.520 --> 14:10.720
 you know, really enacted, he gave them a way of rising out of themselves, of transcending

14:10.720 --> 14:15.680
 themselves, not just individually, but as a people. So, that would go along with what you're

14:15.680 --> 14:25.040
 saying, Lex, of a certain creativity to it. But again, that's not for whatever, and I'm just

14:25.040 --> 14:30.400
 realizing this as I'm answering this. That's not really what's interesting to me about these stories.

14:31.200 --> 14:37.440
 And the Spartans, what was a whole at Thermopylae, that was a whole other kind of metaphor of war.

14:37.440 --> 14:46.640
 That was a sort of a willingly going to one's own death for a greater cause, just like to me,

14:47.360 --> 14:52.800
 the Spartans at Thermopylae enacted as a group what Jesus Christ enacted as an individual,

14:52.800 --> 15:00.240
 a sacrifice of their lives for the greater good. I don't know if that answers your question, but

15:00.240 --> 15:07.440
 that's how I see it. I do feel like, you know, I get invited to speak to ring core groups and

15:07.440 --> 15:13.280
 things like that all the time, and I decline because I don't really feel like I'm a spokesman

15:13.280 --> 15:22.640
 for the warrior class or anything like that. That's not what's interesting about it to me.

15:24.720 --> 15:32.000
 But didn't you just say, with war as a metaphor, that we're all essentially in various ways warriors?

15:33.120 --> 15:40.080
 If we think of it in terms of Jungian archetypes, and think of our life at least as males,

15:40.080 --> 15:46.400
 and the earliest archetypes that kick in are the youth, and the wanderer, and the student,

15:46.400 --> 15:53.440
 and that kind of thing. And then at some point around age 15 to 20, whatever, the warrior archetype

15:53.440 --> 15:58.000
 kicks in. And we want to play football. I want to do martial arts. We want to join the special

15:58.000 --> 16:03.040
 forces. We want to hang out with our buddies. That's our great bond. We want to test ourselves

16:03.040 --> 16:08.480
 against adversity and so on and so forth. But at some point, that archetype, we move beyond

16:08.480 --> 16:15.680
 that archetype. And we become fathers and teachers and so on and so forth. And then there are many

16:15.680 --> 16:24.000
 archetypes beyond that towards the end. So I'm interested in the warrior archetype, but not

16:24.960 --> 16:34.000
 to the be all and end all of everything else. In my book, The Virtues of War, have you read that?

16:34.000 --> 16:39.520
 Yeah. There's a character named Telamon who's actually, it's a long story, but

16:41.440 --> 16:50.240
 when he's with Alexander's army and when they arrive in India, he becomes fascinated by the

16:50.240 --> 16:59.120
 gymnosophists, the fuckers, the naked wise men, the yogis. And he says to Alexander that these guys

16:59.120 --> 17:08.320
 are warriors beyond what we are, even though they do nothing because they are inside their own

17:08.960 --> 17:14.400
 selves all day long. If we go to the Six Day War,

17:17.280 --> 17:21.200
 you write about, in Lionsgate, you write about the Six Day War in Israel.

17:23.040 --> 17:27.200
 I think of the wars you've written about, it's the one we're still in many ways in the

17:27.200 --> 17:35.760
 midst of today. Yes. So what is at the core of that conflict in Israel?

17:35.760 --> 17:40.880
 The Israeli Palestinian conflict? I mean, today it's the Israeli Palestinian conflict, but

17:41.600 --> 17:48.960
 it's echoes of the same conflict in that part of the world with Israel. What is in your sense

17:51.840 --> 17:57.040
 the nature of that conflict? What can we learn about society and human nature from that conflict?

17:57.040 --> 18:01.040
 That is one of the hottest conflicts that still goes on today.

18:01.680 --> 18:07.360
 Well, when I was working on the Lionsgate about the Six Day War, I wrote in the

18:09.360 --> 18:15.440
 introduction that this was not going to be a multi sided story. I was taking an entirely,

18:16.240 --> 18:22.720
 I'm a Jew, I identify with the Israeli people, I was going to see it entirely from their side.

18:22.720 --> 18:28.400
 Yes. So that's probably not what you're asking, but to me,

18:29.920 --> 18:38.080
 the Six Day War and that whole, it's a piece of land that's holy to at least three religions

18:38.080 --> 18:46.000
 and probably more. And from the Jewish point of view, it's where the state of Israel,

18:46.000 --> 18:50.640
 it's where David founded Jerusalem, it's all where the 12 tribes were, etc., etc.,

18:50.640 --> 19:00.160
 Moses came and brought the people. So to me, the Six Day War was about, as I said, a return from

19:00.160 --> 19:06.400
 exile, from diaspora after 2000 years. Now, obviously from the Palestinian point of view

19:06.400 --> 19:12.080
 or the Saudi Arabian point of view or whatever, it's a whole other scenario.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.840
 Religion is at the core of this conflict in some ways. Religion and police.

19:15.840 --> 19:24.080
 Religion and racial slash ethnic tribal identity. I mean, again, what is a Jew? Is a Jew somebody

19:24.080 --> 19:30.880
 that believes in the religion or is it somebody of a certain race that race arose in a certain

19:30.880 --> 19:35.760
 place? Same thing as a Muslim. What is a Muslim? Do they believe in Muhammad or whatever?

19:37.200 --> 19:42.880
 Or did they arise in a certain place in certain ethnicity? Because if we landed from Mars,

19:42.880 --> 19:48.560
 we couldn't tell a Jew from a Palestinian, could we? Just looking at them, you could easily mix

19:48.560 --> 19:53.760
 them and you'd never know. And the specifics of the faith is not necessarily the thing that

19:53.760 --> 20:00.160
 defines the person. No, I don't think so. So you could be like many are secular Jew

20:00.960 --> 20:07.760
 living in Israel and still have a strong bond. Definitely. In fact, almost all of the Jews,

20:07.760 --> 20:14.720
 the fighters that I spoke to from the sixth day were secular and it really was not

20:16.960 --> 20:21.120
 in our religious thing with them as much as it was a national thing.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.480
 So having spent time in Israel,

20:27.200 --> 20:32.160
 how's the world where military conflicts is directly felt, as opposed to maybe if we look at

20:32.160 --> 20:37.360
 the US, where it's distant and far away, how's that world different? How are the people different?

20:37.360 --> 20:41.680
 It's very different, as you know. Yeah. I've never been to Israel, actually.

20:41.680 --> 20:47.200
 Oh, you haven't. I haven't felt it. Well, you should definitely go. I mean,

20:48.400 --> 20:55.760
 here in the United States, where when like an incident like Charlottesville comes up,

20:55.760 --> 20:58.560
 you know, where people are chanting, Jews will not replace us, blah, blah, blah.

20:59.280 --> 21:04.080
 The impulse in the Jewish community is to think of, well, how can we reach out

21:04.080 --> 21:10.640
 to the other side? How can we show them that we are human beings

21:10.640 --> 21:14.480
 like they are and show them that we care for them, et cetera, et cetera? That's the sort of

21:15.200 --> 21:24.240
 distant from war. If you're in Israel, like if you and I were Israeli citizens right now,

21:24.240 --> 21:28.880
 you would be a fighter pilot or a tank commander or whatever. You would not just be

21:28.880 --> 21:35.680
 just working at MIT or whatever. And I would be in the Army too. And so, from their point of view,

21:35.680 --> 21:40.960
 they say, all those people who hate us, can I curse on this? Of course. Of this thing?

21:41.760 --> 21:46.000
 Fuck them, we'll kill them. We'll kill them. If they dared across the line,

21:46.560 --> 21:52.160
 and that's their whole different point of view. To me, it's actually a healthier point of view.

21:52.160 --> 21:59.600
 You think so? So, let me ask the hard question. Well, maybe it's an impossible question.

21:59.600 --> 22:05.920
 How do we resolve that conflict? In Israel or anywhere?

22:05.920 --> 22:13.440
 Anywhere where the instinct is to reach out in US and say FU and the people.

22:14.720 --> 22:21.360
 I think that the only way that two warring sides or two sides that are opposed to one another

22:21.360 --> 22:25.520
 can never really come together is when there's mutual respect. We'll get just more water.

22:27.200 --> 22:35.280
 When there's mutual respect, and they can see each other as equals, and when there's mutual fear,

22:36.640 --> 22:41.440
 where one side says, we don't dare cross the line with this other side,

22:41.440 --> 22:45.520
 and the other side says the same thing. I think then you can kind of reach across that thing and

22:45.520 --> 22:53.200
 say, okay, we'll stay here. You stay here. We'll mingle in cultural ways, and we'll have interchange,

22:53.200 --> 22:58.000
 you know, winter marriage, da da da da da da. But as soon as one side has no power,

22:58.640 --> 23:06.560
 as the Jewish people have had no power throughout the diaspora forever, then it's just a human nature.

23:07.440 --> 23:12.000
 You can see it in Trump and what he does to any vulnerable minority.

23:12.000 --> 23:21.280
 And he's not alone. I'm not blaming him alone. That's human nature. So I do think that that

23:21.280 --> 23:26.640
 idea of like, fuck you, if you cross the line, we'll kill you is really a good way, is a good

23:26.640 --> 23:31.120
 place to start from. Because now you can sit down on opposite sides of the table and say,

23:31.120 --> 23:35.600
 you know, what do we have in common? How can we, we want to raise our children? You want to raise

23:35.600 --> 23:43.200
 your children? How can we do this in a way that we're not hurting each other? So you kind of said

23:43.200 --> 23:49.200
 that you need to arrive at some kind of balance of power. But you haven't spoken to the fact that

23:49.200 --> 23:57.680
 there's deeply rooted hatred of the other. So is there no way to alleviate that hatred? Or is that,

23:59.920 --> 24:04.800
 I mean, what role does love and hate come? I think that hatred can go away. I really do. I mean,

24:04.800 --> 24:11.440
 if you look at even, even now that I haven't seen this in person, but they say that the Saudis

24:11.440 --> 24:16.800
 and the Israelis are collaborating on certain things, you know, by their mutual fear of or

24:16.800 --> 24:25.760
 antagonism to Iran. I do think that even really long, long, longstanding hatreds and animosity,

24:25.760 --> 24:30.480
 thousands of years old, can go away under the right circumstances.

24:30.480 --> 24:36.640
 In a, on what time scale? I mean, for instance, I don't know.

24:36.640 --> 24:42.800
 Does some people have to die? Do generations have to die and pass away? And new generations come up

24:42.800 --> 24:47.200
 with less hate? Or can a single individual learn to not hate?

24:47.200 --> 24:50.880
 I think a single individual can learn to not hate because it certainly doesn't seem to,

24:50.880 --> 24:54.800
 over thousands of years doesn't seem to work. You know, we keep thinking that that's going to happen.

24:54.800 --> 25:01.680
 But I think it's, we're in a real spiritual realm here when you're talking about that.

25:01.680 --> 25:07.040
 You're in a realm of, you know, Buddha, Jesus, whatever, something like that,

25:07.680 --> 25:14.640
 that we're a, you know, a true change of soul happens. But I do think that's possible.

25:16.480 --> 25:24.400
 So what do you think is the future of warfare, especially with what many people see as the

25:24.400 --> 25:31.280
 expansion of the military industrial conflict? To what? Do you, I know you're not a military historian.

25:32.640 --> 25:40.000
 I'm asking more as a metaphor. And would you see us as people continuing to fight?

25:41.200 --> 25:45.600
 You know, it's a really great question, Alex, because, because I think now with

25:45.600 --> 25:54.240
 social media, TV, movies, all of these things that create empathy across cultures,

25:55.120 --> 26:01.360
 it becomes harder and harder, I think, I think, to totally demonize the other,

26:02.000 --> 26:08.080
 the way it was in previous wars. I also think I don't really see an appetite

26:08.720 --> 26:14.960
 for people wanting to go to war these days. And in a way, I don't know if that's good or bad.

26:14.960 --> 26:19.920
 It's like everybody's so fat and lazy and so concerned with how many clicks they're getting

26:20.480 --> 26:28.160
 that, you know, whereas I know at the start of World War I, both the younger generations were

26:29.360 --> 26:35.920
 eager to go to war. You know, I think it was, it was insane. But it was that sort of warrior

26:35.920 --> 26:43.120
 archetype that we were talking about before that, that generational testosterone,

26:43.120 --> 26:50.320
 eros thing, whereas nowadays, I don't know. I mean, it's hard to say there's not

26:50.320 --> 26:55.680
 going to be another war because there always are. But it's sort of hard to imagine people

26:55.680 --> 27:01.280
 getting off their ass these days to do anything. Well, it's funny that you mentioned social media

27:01.280 --> 27:07.760
 as a place for empathy, sure. But it's, in a sense, it's a place for war as well.

27:07.760 --> 27:14.880
 For hatred, yeah. True. For hatred. And perhaps the positive aspect of

27:14.880 --> 27:24.240
 hatred on social media is that it's somewhat less harmful than murder. And so it kind of dissipates

27:24.240 --> 27:36.320
 sort of the hate folds. You get the hate out at a, you know, at a less, on a daily basis.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.360
 And thereby never boils up to a point where you want to kill.

27:39.360 --> 27:43.680
 It's also a really weird thing that's going on. I don't know if anybody really understands,

27:43.680 --> 27:49.280
 like with video games, where kids are acting out these incredible horror things, right?

27:49.920 --> 27:54.560
 But you know that if they cut their finger, they would like freak out, you know?

27:54.560 --> 28:02.240
 Yeah. And I also don't think that many of the people that are hateful on social media,

28:02.240 --> 28:07.280
 if they were face to face with the person, it wouldn't. So there's a sort of a two

28:10.000 --> 28:14.560
 mental spheres happening at the same time. And I don't know how that

28:15.120 --> 28:19.200
 maps to the actual military, how that actually maps to military conflict.

28:20.880 --> 28:24.240
 Like when you, if you in the United States have a draft, for example,

28:25.280 --> 28:29.280
 how the populace would respond different than they did in previous generations.

28:29.280 --> 28:33.680
 Yeah. I think they certainly would. Yeah. Another question. I'm not sure if you thought

28:33.680 --> 28:38.800
 about it, but I work on building artificial intelligence systems. In our community,

28:38.800 --> 28:43.680
 many people worried about AI being used in war. So automating the killing process.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.880
 With drones and in general, it's being used more and more.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.600
 I should recuse myself on that when I really haven't thought about that.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.160
 Yeah. I'd rather ask you what you think about it.

28:55.120 --> 28:58.160
 Well, it's interesting. I mean, because it's so fundamentally different from

28:58.160 --> 29:03.680
 if you look at the Battle of Thermopylae. It means just if we talk about the difference

29:03.680 --> 29:11.680
 between a gun and a sword. I'll tell you one little anecdote. There was a Spartan king,

29:11.680 --> 29:17.120
 I don't know which one it was, but at one point they showed him a new invention and it could

29:17.120 --> 29:25.280
 launch a bolt that would kill someone at a range of 200 yards. And the king wept and said,

29:25.280 --> 29:33.280
 Alas, Valor is no more. Because there, point of view of war, it was highly ritualized, as you know.

29:33.840 --> 29:40.400
 And the code of honor was that you were not supposed to be able to kill another person

29:40.400 --> 29:45.760
 unless you yourself were in equal danger of being killed. And any other way of doing that,

29:45.760 --> 29:53.280
 even bow and arrow, was considered less than manly and less than honorable. And maybe we

29:53.280 --> 29:57.280
 should go back to that because at least it makes the stakes real and true.

29:59.360 --> 30:06.800
 And not that we could. Not that's the point. You were in the Marine Corps, so

30:10.080 --> 30:16.960
 we talk about the real, the bloody conflicts you've written about, many of them. So let me

30:16.960 --> 30:24.640
 ask a personal question. Have you, sort of as writing and in general, have you

30:25.520 --> 30:32.880
 thought about what it takes to kill a person if you yourself could do it in the war?

30:32.880 --> 30:34.160
 I have thought about it, yeah.

30:34.160 --> 30:40.080
 And how that would make you feel? Of course, one never knows. I certainly,

30:40.080 --> 30:46.800
 I have not been in combat. I haven't killed anybody. But I would imagine in the real world

30:47.680 --> 30:57.360
 that it would change you utterly forever. Because you can't help but

30:58.160 --> 31:04.160
 identify with the person that you've just killed. And it's another human being. And I mean,

31:04.160 --> 31:10.000
 I have a hard time killing a spider. So I would imagine that it's something that

31:10.880 --> 31:13.840
 warriors understand and nobody else understands.

31:14.880 --> 31:19.920
 And you've spoken with many. I mean, you've spoken with people who've seen

31:19.920 --> 31:28.160
 military combat in Israel. What, have they been able to articulate the experience of killing?

31:28.160 --> 31:36.000
 It's sort of just what I said. I mean, I'm even thinking of one pilot that I interviewed over

31:36.000 --> 31:49.440
 there who was strafing a tank in his Mustang and saw at really low altitude and saw what

31:49.440 --> 31:53.760
 his bullets did to the guy and could see his face and everything like that, which is even,

31:53.760 --> 31:58.480
 you know, one remove or more removes from an infantryman, what an infantryman does.

31:59.120 --> 32:04.560
 And he said that same thing that I said, that it just changes you and you can never say it,

32:04.560 --> 32:07.680
 never look at the world or look at anything the same way again.

32:08.480 --> 32:12.960
 And when that happens at scale, it's thousands, tens of thousands of hundred,

32:12.960 --> 32:15.600
 that changes entire societies. I mean, that's what we've seen.

32:16.480 --> 32:20.320
 At least it, but the problem is it doesn't change the politicians back home.

32:20.320 --> 32:25.120
 Right. How important is mortality?

32:26.880 --> 32:32.400
 Finiteness, the fact that this thing ends to the creative process. So

32:34.160 --> 32:40.880
 killing in war really emphasizes that. But in general, the fact that this thing ends,

32:40.880 --> 32:53.520
 it does. It does. And shit. And a serious note, do you think about your own mortality?

32:53.520 --> 32:57.040
 Do you meditate on your own mortality when you think about the work you do?

32:57.040 --> 33:03.360
 That's another great question, Alex. Actually, I'm 75 and I just was having,

33:03.360 --> 33:08.080
 I had breakfast in New York a few months ago with a friend of mine who's like my exact same age.

33:08.080 --> 33:13.680
 And I said to him, I said, Nick, do you ever think about mortality? And he said,

33:13.680 --> 33:20.080
 every fucking minute of every day. And I was kind of relieved to hear that because I do,

33:20.080 --> 33:27.920
 I do too. But actually, I always have, I think. And I think the fact of mortality

33:29.040 --> 33:34.080
 is kind of gives meaning to life. I think that's why we want to create.

33:34.080 --> 33:45.040
 That's why we want to make a mark of some kind. And the other aspect of it is what's on the other

33:45.040 --> 33:55.120
 side of that mortality. I'm a believer in previous lives. The question I've never been able to answer

33:55.120 --> 34:03.600
 among many, many others is like, why are we even here? Why are we in the flesh? I like to believe

34:03.600 --> 34:14.320
 that God or some force is we're on some kind of journey. But I'm not sure why we were put

34:14.320 --> 34:21.200
 in this world where the ground rules are, if you think about animal life, that you cannot live from

34:21.200 --> 34:28.240
 one day to the next without killing and eating some other form of life. I mean, what a demented

34:28.240 --> 34:34.960
 thing. Why couldn't we just have a solar panel on our head and be friends with everybody?

34:37.520 --> 34:41.360
 I don't get what that was all about, but that's sort of the big issue.

34:42.160 --> 34:47.760
 Have you read Ernest Becker's Denial of Death, for example? Is Ernest Becker a philosopher

34:47.760 --> 34:59.360
 that said that the fear of death is really the primary driver of everything we do? So Freud had

34:59.360 --> 35:06.000
 what? I would agree with that. So you've always thought about even your own mortality.

35:06.000 --> 35:14.400
 Yes, definitely. And can you elaborate on the reincarnation aspect of what you were talking

35:14.400 --> 35:23.280
 about? What's your sense that we had previous lives? Have you thought concretely, or is it a

35:23.280 --> 35:31.680
 lot of it? No, I've thought concretely about it. I mean, it's very clear when you see children,

35:32.960 --> 35:39.440
 young kids, or even dogs and cats, that they come into the world with personalities.

35:39.440 --> 35:44.080
 And three kids and a family are going to be completely different and completely

35:44.080 --> 35:52.400
 their own person. And that person that they are doesn't change over life. And there's one of the

35:52.400 --> 36:00.640
 things that I did in my book, The Artist's Journey, is that there were certain things where I

36:00.640 --> 36:06.880
 tracked or just listed in order, like all of Bruce Springsteen's albums or all of Philip Roth's books,

36:06.880 --> 36:16.800
 kind of a body of work throughout over a period of 30, 40, 50 years. And you can see that there's

36:16.800 --> 36:23.440
 a theme running through all of those things, that it's completely unique to that person. Nobody else

36:23.440 --> 36:29.440
 could have written Philip Roth's books or Bruce Springsteen's songs. And you can even see sort

36:29.440 --> 36:39.920
 of a destiny there. So I ask myself, well, where did that come from? It seems to be a continuation

36:39.920 --> 36:45.600
 of something that happened before and that will lead to something else, because it's not starting

36:45.600 --> 36:54.080
 from scratch. It seems like there's a calling, a destiny in there already. This gets back to the

36:54.080 --> 37:00.400
 muse and all that kind of thing. So yeah, it's almost like there's this, let's call it a God,

37:01.520 --> 37:08.320
 it's passing, it's almost like sampling parts of a previous human that has lived

37:08.320 --> 37:13.360
 and putting those into the new one. Sampling is probably a pretty good word.

37:13.920 --> 37:17.680
 Taking some of the good, well, you can't take all the good parts because the bad parts is what

37:17.680 --> 37:24.560
 makes the person take it all together. Okay, this is humans only or does it pass around from animals

37:24.560 --> 37:31.840
 in your view? I don't know. That's above my pay grade. I don't know. So okay, so you talk about

37:31.840 --> 37:43.600
 the muse as the source of ideas, maybe. Since you've gotten a few glimpses of her in your writing,

37:43.600 --> 37:54.160
 tell me, what is it possible for you to tell me about her? Where does she reside? What does she

37:54.160 --> 37:59.600
 look like? I mean, you can look at it in many different ways. The Greeks did it in an anthropomorphic

37:59.600 --> 38:06.720
 way. They created gods that were like human beings. But if you look at it from a Kabbalistic Jewish

38:06.720 --> 38:13.200
 perspective, Jewish mysticism, you could say that it's the soul, the neshama, that the soul is above

38:13.200 --> 38:20.880
 us on a higher plane, our own your soul, my soul, and is trying to reach down to us and communicate

38:20.880 --> 38:27.360
 with us. And we're trying simultaneously to reach up to it through prayer or through, if you're a

38:27.360 --> 38:33.440
 writer or an artist, when you sit down at the keyboard, you're entering into a kind of prayer.

38:33.440 --> 38:39.520
 You're entering into a different state of an altered consciousness to some extent. You're

38:39.520 --> 38:45.840
 opening yourself, opening the pipeline or turning on the radio to tune into the cosmic radio station.

38:46.800 --> 38:54.320
 Another way of looking at it, this is an, did you ever see the movie City of Angels? The visual

38:54.320 --> 39:00.160
 of the movie, it was Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage. Oh, and they go skate? Yeah, I've seen it, yep.

39:00.160 --> 39:10.240
 And right, the visual of the movie sort of was Meg Ryan is a heart surgeon. And as she's operating

39:10.240 --> 39:17.040
 on somebody, suddenly Nicholas Cage in this long duster coat, like Jesse James, appears right

39:17.040 --> 39:23.520
 next to her in the operating room and he's an angel. And he's waiting to take out the soul of

39:23.520 --> 39:29.600
 the patient on the operating table. And she doesn't see him, she's totally unaware of him.

39:29.600 --> 39:33.760
 And so is everybody else in the operating room, except maybe the guy who's about to die,

39:33.760 --> 39:43.200
 who suddenly sees him. But I kind of believe that there are beings like that. Or if you don't

39:43.200 --> 39:48.160
 like that, it's a force, it's a consciousness, it's something that are right here right now.

39:49.280 --> 39:56.160
 And we, and they're trying to communicate to us. And like through a membrane,

39:56.160 --> 40:02.960
 like tapping on that window over there, they're like right out there. And they carry the future.

40:03.600 --> 40:10.480
 They are everything that is in potential. All the works that you will do, Lex,

40:11.200 --> 40:18.880
 your startup, whatever else you're doing, they know that. And it's not really you

40:19.600 --> 40:24.560
 that's coming up with those ideas, in my opinion. Those things are appearing, you know,

40:24.560 --> 40:33.440
 it's like somebody knocks on the door and puts it in. I mean, in the Iliad, where gods and goddesses

40:33.440 --> 40:38.640
 appear along with the human antagonists on the battlefield all the time, right? They'll be,

40:38.640 --> 40:43.840
 you know, Homer flashes to Olympus and then back to the real world. And there's a thing where

40:43.840 --> 40:51.440
 one Aphrodite, let's say, wants to help Paris. And so she says, well, I will appear to him in a dream.

40:51.440 --> 40:58.080
 And I'll take the form of his brother. And I'll say, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum. So that's

41:00.240 --> 41:07.440
 creatures beings on one dimension, as the Greeks thought, communicating with, and I believe that

41:07.440 --> 41:12.080
 that's exactly what's going on in one, whatever analogy you want to use.

41:12.080 --> 41:21.200
 But that communication, to which degree is, do you play the role in that communication, as opposed to

41:21.200 --> 41:27.920
 sitting at the computer, if you're a writer, and staring at the blank page, and putting in the

41:27.920 --> 41:36.800
 time and waiting? What, so if in your, in your view, is, are these creatures

41:36.800 --> 41:46.160
 basically waiting to tell you about your future? Or is there choice? How many possible futures

41:46.160 --> 41:50.880
 are there? How many possible ideas are there? That's a great question. I think there's basically,

41:52.560 --> 41:58.880
 yes, there are alternatives, you know, degrees within it. But if you look at Bruce Springsteen's

41:58.880 --> 42:08.000
 albums, how much could he have done really differently? Yeah, he would, you can just see

42:08.000 --> 42:12.960
 there's a whole impetus going through the whole thing. And nothing was going to shake him off

42:12.960 --> 42:17.920
 that, you know? And yeah, maybe the river could have been different, it could have been called

42:17.920 --> 42:24.720
 something else. But, but he was dealing with certain issues. His conscious self was dealing

42:24.720 --> 42:30.080
 with certain issues that were really out of his control. He was, he was drawn, he was called to

42:30.080 --> 42:37.840
 it, right? Nothing could stop him. And so it is sort of a partnership, but I think the creative

42:37.840 --> 42:46.480
 process between the creative impulse that's coming from some other place, or it's coming from deep

42:46.480 --> 42:52.560
 within us is another way to look at it. You know, it's like if we are acorns and we're growing into

42:52.560 --> 43:02.480
 oaks. So the conscious artist who's sitting there at the keyboard or whatever is applying

43:02.480 --> 43:09.760
 his or her consciousness to that, but is also going into opening themselves to the unconscious

43:09.760 --> 43:15.840
 and to this other realm, whatever, whatever that is. I mean, certainly, songwriters for a million

43:15.840 --> 43:20.160
 years have said, you know, a song just came into their head, right? Yes. Palm just, all they had to

43:20.160 --> 43:27.360
 do is write. But then you ever see that thing where of Keats's notes for a thing of beauty is a joy

43:27.360 --> 43:32.160
 forever? It's like covers the entire page and it's like, you know, he's crossing this out and that

43:32.160 --> 43:38.880
 out, and he has his consciousness, his conscious mind is working on it. But so I do think it's

43:38.880 --> 43:44.800
 a partnership. And I think that I know when I was first starting out as a writer, I worked in

43:44.800 --> 43:53.280
 advertising and I tried to do novels that I could never do. I was like really unskilled

43:53.280 --> 44:01.760
 at getting to that, tuning into that station. I just beat my brains out and was unable to do it,

44:01.760 --> 44:08.000
 you know, except because I was sort of trying too hard, it was sort of like a zen monk or a

44:08.000 --> 44:13.360
 monk of some kind trying to meditate and just like constantly thoughts driving you crazy.

44:13.360 --> 44:20.240
 But over time, you know, not wood, I've kind of gotten better at it. And I can sort of let go of

44:20.240 --> 44:30.400
 those, that part of me that's trying so hard. And so these angels can speak a little more easily

44:30.400 --> 44:31.360
 through the membrane.

44:31.360 --> 44:39.360
 Can you put into words the process of letting go and clearing that channel of communication?

44:39.360 --> 44:40.320
 What does it take?

44:40.320 --> 44:47.680
 That's another great question. For me, it just took probably 30 years. And I don't even, I would,

44:47.680 --> 44:53.200
 I guess I would liken it to meditation, even though I'm not a meditator. But it would seem to

44:53.200 --> 44:58.480
 me to be one of the hardest things in the world to just sit still and stop thinking.

44:59.200 --> 45:06.320
 Right? And so it's very hard to put into words. And I think that's why these teachers of meditation

45:06.320 --> 45:13.680
 use tricks and koans and stuff like that. But for me, at least, I think it was just

45:14.720 --> 45:20.400
 a process of years and years of trying and finally of beating my head in the wall

45:20.400 --> 45:27.120
 and finally little by little giving up the beating of the head. But there doesn't seem

45:27.120 --> 45:31.760
 to be any trick. Everybody wants a hack these days. And I don't think there is a hack.

45:31.760 --> 45:38.640
 If you look at it in terms of the goddess, the muse, she's watching you down there

45:39.440 --> 45:43.600
 beating your head in the wall. You're like a marine going through an obstacle course or

45:43.600 --> 45:48.960
 a martial artist trying to learn, you know, like Uma Thurman doing the casket deal,

45:48.960 --> 45:55.920
 trying to make that little four inch punch, you know. The muse or the goddess is just sort of

45:55.920 --> 46:00.960
 watching going, Alex, he's trying, he's trying. I'm going to come back in another couple of

46:00.960 --> 46:06.000
 months and see if he's still there. And finally she'll say, all right, he's had a,

46:06.000 --> 46:09.120
 he's beaten, he's paid his dues. I'm going to give it to him.

46:09.680 --> 46:16.080
 So the hard work and the suffering, yeah. But, you know, I'm also being Russian

46:16.800 --> 46:22.800
 in wrestling and martial arts. We're big into drilling technique. I was also just even getting at

46:22.800 --> 46:30.640
 that. There's certainly, there's no shortcut, but is there a process? So you're at the practice,

46:30.640 --> 46:38.240
 there can be the process of practice. So you had two, one, you had an example of meditation.

46:38.800 --> 46:44.400
 So it's essentially the practice of meditation. I think it's a good drill. I think it's a good

46:44.400 --> 46:50.480
 way to look at it too. But what are you, what are you drilling? You're just sitting and you're,

46:50.480 --> 46:55.120
 you're writing, you know, just writing, you're writing, you're, then you're looking at what you

46:55.120 --> 47:01.600
 wrote, you know, you're hitting moments when it flows, you know, and you're, and you're, and in

47:01.600 --> 47:05.600
 your other hitting moments where you just can't do anything and you're trying to, from the moments

47:05.600 --> 47:10.160
 that were it flowed, you're trying to come back and look at and say, what, what did I do? How did,

47:10.160 --> 47:16.160
 how did that happen? War was in my mind, you know, but I think it's just a process of over and over

47:16.160 --> 47:24.160
 and over and over until finally it gets a little bit easier. And did you, did you always, when you,

47:24.160 --> 47:30.960
 when you read something you write, did you always have a pretty good radar for what's good and not

47:30.960 --> 47:43.280
 after it's written? No, I think I do now. But, but no, it was always really hard for me to know

47:43.280 --> 47:51.360
 what was good. I mean, do you edit the process of editing? Is the process of looking at what you've

47:51.360 --> 47:57.680
 written and improving it? Are you a better writer or an editor? How often do you edit?

47:57.680 --> 48:02.880
 That's another great question. Great question. Cause I do think that in writing, the real process

48:02.880 --> 48:08.960
 of looking at it is the process that an editor does rather than what a writer does. The gentleman

48:08.960 --> 48:13.840
 I was just talking to on the phone is my editor, Sean Coyne, who was the guy who bought Gates of

48:13.840 --> 48:20.080
 Fire when he was an editor at Doubleday. And who basically when I finish a book, I give it to him.

48:21.120 --> 48:29.440
 And he, and he gives me, you know, he, he editing doesn't really mean like crossing out commas.

48:29.440 --> 48:37.440
 It really means looking at the overall work and saying, does it work? And if it doesn't work,

48:37.440 --> 48:42.320
 why doesn't it work? Is there something wrong here? You know, like if you were building the

48:42.320 --> 48:49.120
 Golden Gate Bridge, you know, and one span was out of whack, you know, you could, and I think a

48:49.120 --> 48:55.680
 really skilled editor, which Sean is, understands what, what makes a story tick. And he also has

48:55.680 --> 49:01.840
 the perspective that I've lost in something I've wrote, because I'm so close to it to say, you

49:01.840 --> 49:07.600
 know, this, you know, this isn't working. And that is working. What kind of advice has he given you?

49:07.600 --> 49:14.480
 Is it like layout? Like, this story doesn't flow correctly. Like you shouldn't start at this point.

49:15.040 --> 49:21.440
 Or does he even sit back at a higher level and say, I see what you're doing, but you could do better.

49:22.320 --> 49:28.960
 No, he doesn't do that. Okay. But a lot of it is about genre and kind of the

49:28.960 --> 49:36.640
 defining what genre you're working in. And I'm going to get up here to just bring something

49:36.640 --> 49:43.840
 over here for the camera. This was one where Sean tore this down and made me start from scratch.

49:44.480 --> 49:51.280
 And what the specifics of it were really, this is a supernatural thriller. That's the genre,

49:51.280 --> 49:59.200
 sort of like Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist. And what he made, what he showed me was that I kind of,

49:59.200 --> 50:08.080
 I had violated certain conventions of the genre, you know, that, and you just can't do that, you

50:08.080 --> 50:15.840
 know, it's got to be, you know, it has to be done the right way. And so he pointed out certain things

50:15.840 --> 50:26.000
 to me. So he must be a prolific reader himself too, actually. That's such a tough job of editor.

50:26.000 --> 50:33.040
 Yeah. Again, he was sort of born to do that. He just kind of glommed onto it. But since he was

50:34.160 --> 50:43.680
 his first job publishing, you know, cat thrillers, you know, cat detective. But, you know, he studied

50:43.680 --> 50:49.920
 how it works, what makes the story work, etc., etc. And so he really, he's great. And I think any

50:50.880 --> 50:56.240
 really successful writer, unless they're utterly brilliant on their own, has got to have a great

50:56.240 --> 51:02.880
 editor behind them. But you yourself edit as well. I'm constantly trying to learn from him and teach

51:02.880 --> 51:09.360
 myself. Everything you see in my blog posts about, that it's about the craft of writing,

51:09.360 --> 51:15.600
 is me trying to teach myself the rules so that, you know, I'm sure it's the same in martial arts

51:15.600 --> 51:22.160
 or anything else, right? You try to not be dependent on that other person because it's so

51:22.160 --> 51:27.440
 painful to make those mistakes. You really feel like, God, I wish I could get it right the first

51:27.440 --> 51:32.960
 time, the next time I do it. Well, in research, we go through that. In research, more than writing,

51:32.960 --> 51:37.600
 so what you do is a little more solitary. In research, there's usually two, three,

51:37.600 --> 51:42.640
 four people working on something together, and we write a paper. And there's that painful process

51:42.640 --> 51:48.560
 of where you write it down, and then you share it with other, and not only do they criticize the

51:48.560 --> 51:54.800
 writing, they criticize the fundamental aspects of the approach you've taken.

51:54.800 --> 51:58.640
 I would think so. So that's exactly like, you know, they would say, you're attacking,

51:58.640 --> 52:02.560
 you're asking the wrong questions, right? Yeah. And that's extremely, you know,

52:02.560 --> 52:08.160
 painful, especially when you, well, it's painful and helpful, but there's disagreement and so on.

52:09.280 --> 52:15.520
 And through that comes out a better product in the end. If you want to still have an ego,

52:15.520 --> 52:20.480
 but you also want to silence it every once in a while, so there's a balance. In your book,

52:20.480 --> 52:26.720
 The War of Art, you talk about resistance with the capital R as the invisible force in this

52:26.720 --> 52:34.000
 universe of ours that finds a way to prevent you from starting or doing the work.

52:36.640 --> 52:41.360
 Where do you think resistance comes from? Why is there a force in our mind that's constantly

52:41.360 --> 52:48.160
 trying to jeopardize our efforts with laziness, excuses, and so on? That's another great question.

52:48.160 --> 52:54.480
 I mean, in Jewish mysticism, in Kabbalistic thinking, it's called the Yetzar Hurrah,

52:54.480 --> 53:01.520
 right? And it's a force that if this up here is your soul of Neshama trying to talk to you,

53:01.520 --> 53:06.720
 us down here, the Yetzar Hurrah is this negative force in the middle. So I'm not the only one

53:06.720 --> 53:12.080
 that ever thought about this. But, and I don't know if anybody really knows the answer, but here's

53:12.080 --> 53:21.520
 my answer. I think that there are two places where we as human beings can seat our identity.

53:21.520 --> 53:28.720
 One is the ego, the conscious ego, and the other is the greater self and the self in the

53:28.720 --> 53:35.520
 Jungian sense. The self in the Jungian sense includes the unconscious and butts up against what Jung

53:35.520 --> 53:41.200
 called the divine ground, which what I would call the muse, the goddess, or whatever. And I think,

53:41.200 --> 53:48.720
 and the ego is just this little dot inside this bigger self. And the ego has a completely different

53:48.720 --> 53:56.880
 view of life as from the self. The ego believes, I'm going to give you a long answer here, Alex.

53:56.880 --> 54:04.400
 No, perfect. The ego believes that death is real. The ego believes that time and space are real.

54:04.400 --> 54:11.600
 The ego believes that each one of us is separate from the other. I'm separate from you. I could

54:11.600 --> 54:18.720
 punch you in the face and it wouldn't hurt me. It would only hurt you. And in the ego's world,

54:18.720 --> 54:24.880
 the dominant emotion is fear, because we are all made of flesh. We can all die. We can all be hurt.

54:24.880 --> 54:30.000
 We can all be ruined. So we are protecting ourselves and even our desire to create,

54:30.720 --> 54:36.880
 as we were talking about before, comes out of that fear of death. The self, on the other hand,

54:36.880 --> 54:43.200
 the greater self that butts up against the divine ground, believes that death is not real, that time

54:43.200 --> 54:50.640
 and space are not real, that the gods travel swift as thought. And the ego also believes that,

54:51.200 --> 54:56.080
 I mean, the self believes that there's no difference between you and me that we're all one. If I hurt

54:56.080 --> 55:03.520
 you, I hurt myself. Karma, right? And in the world of the self, of the greater self,

55:03.520 --> 55:10.640
 the dominant emotion is love, not fear. Now, so I think that, let me go farther back here,

55:11.200 --> 55:19.760
 a long way to answer your question. When Jesus died on the cross, or when the 300 Spartans

55:20.880 --> 55:26.880
 willingly sacrificed their lives at their monopoly, they were acting according to the rules of the

55:26.880 --> 55:34.080
 self. Death is not real. No difference between you and me. Time and space are not real. Predominant

55:34.080 --> 55:46.000
 emotion is love. So in my opinion, we as conscious human vessels are in a struggle between these

55:46.000 --> 55:52.480
 two things, the ego and the self. To me, resistance is the voice of the ego saying,

55:52.480 --> 56:01.600
 and it's a fearful voice. Because if when we identify with the self, we move our consciousness

56:01.600 --> 56:07.920
 over to the self as artists or scientists opening ourselves up to the cosmic dimension,

56:07.920 --> 56:16.400
 to the other forces, the ego is tremendously threatened by that. Because if we're in that

56:16.400 --> 56:22.880
 space, that headspace, we don't need the ego anymore. So I think resistance is a voice of the

56:22.880 --> 56:31.440
 ego trying to keep control of us. In a way, I'll give you a bad example. Trump is the ego.

56:31.440 --> 56:40.160
 That's probably a very good example, right? It's a zero sum world for him. And for anybody that's

56:40.160 --> 56:46.240
 in that. And the opposite of that would be somebody like Martin Luther King or Gandhi.

56:47.600 --> 56:52.240
 And that's of course why they all wind up getting assassinated. Because that voice,

56:52.240 --> 57:01.120
 that ego is hanging onto itself and feels so threatened by... I could talk more about this

57:01.120 --> 57:06.080
 if you want to. No, for sure. That's fascinating. It's interesting why the

57:06.080 --> 57:12.960
 fear is attached to the ego. I really like this dichotomy of ego and self and that struggle.

57:14.080 --> 57:25.360
 It's just the ego has the self obsession of it. Why fear is such a predominant thing?

57:25.360 --> 57:31.040
 Why is resistance trying to undermine everything? It's fear. It's out of fear.

57:31.040 --> 57:40.400
 Let's think about the whole thing in terms of stories. In a story, the villain is always

57:40.400 --> 57:46.880
 resistance, is always the ego. The hero is always, of course, always not everything,

57:46.880 --> 57:51.920
 but you know what I mean? Pretty much represents kind of the self. If you think about the alien

57:52.720 --> 57:57.120
 on the spaceship, that's like the ultimate kind of villain. It keeps changing form, right?

57:57.120 --> 58:03.040
 First it goes on the guy's face, then it pops out of his chest, but it always just has that one

58:03.040 --> 58:12.800
 monomaniacal thing to destroy, you know? And just like the ego, just like resistance. And

58:13.840 --> 58:17.280
 maybe alien is a bad example because Sigourney Weaver has to sort of

58:18.240 --> 58:24.320
 fight on the same terms as the alien. But maybe a better example might be something like Casablanca,

58:24.320 --> 58:32.400
 where in the end the Humphrey Bogart character has to, acting, operating out of the self,

58:32.400 --> 58:41.360
 has to give up his selfish dream of going off with Ingrid Bergman, Neil Salund, the love of his life,

58:41.360 --> 58:49.120
 and instead puts her on the plane to Lisbon while he goes off to fight the Nazis in the desert.

58:49.120 --> 58:58.320
 I don't know if that's clear, but in almost every story, the villain is the ego, his resistance,

58:58.320 --> 59:06.400
 his fear, is that zero sum thing. And in almost every story, the hero is someone that is willing

59:06.400 --> 59:15.040
 to make a sacrifice to help others. It's letting go of that fear is what leads to productivity

59:15.040 --> 59:25.760
 and to success. Do you think there's, this is probably the answer, either obvious or impossible,

59:25.760 --> 59:34.720
 but do you think there's an evolutionary advantage to resistance? What would life look like without

59:34.720 --> 59:43.120
 resistance? That's another great question. I think I also believe that resistance like death

59:43.120 --> 59:49.760
 gives a meaning to life. If we didn't have it, it's going to be, what would we be? We'd be in

59:49.760 --> 59:58.080
 the Garden of Eden picking fruit and just happy and stupid. And I do think that that myth of the

59:58.080 --> 1:00:04.800
 Garden of Eden is really about this kind of thing, where Adam and Eve decide to take matters into

1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:13.280
 their own hands and acquire knowledge that until then, God had said, I'm the only one that's got

1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:19.520
 that knowledge. And of course, once they've acquired that knowledge, they're cast out into the world

1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:24.320
 you and I live in now, where they do have to deal with that fear and they do have to deal with all

1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:30.960
 that stuff. It's a human condition. The human condition and the meaning and the purpose comes

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:38.400
 from the resistance being there and the struggle to overcome it.

1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:45.680
 To overcome it. Right. And also, the other aspect of it is that it's not real at all. It's not even

1:00:45.680 --> 1:01:04.000
 like it's an actual force. It's all here. In a way, it's a surrender to it. It's sort of like

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:11.040
 turning on the light in a dark thing. It's like it's gone. But not quite because it's never

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:15.840
 right. Because it comes back again tomorrow morning. Exactly. So you have to keep changing

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:21.520
 light bulbs every day. So what's been maybe recently, but in general, maybe in your life,

1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:26.960
 what's been the most relentless or one of the more relentless sources of resistance to you

1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:36.720
 personally? I mean, it's always the same. It's about writing for me and evolving within my own

1:01:36.720 --> 1:01:45.680
 body of work. It never goes away. It never gets any less. Do you have particular excuses?

1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:52.960
 Particular justifications that come out? No. It's always the same. Well, I would say it's

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:58.400
 always the same, but it's really not because resistance is so protean. It keeps changing form.

1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:05.040
 And as you move to hopefully a higher level, resistance gets a little more nuanced and a

1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:11.920
 little more subtle trying to fake you out. But I think you learn that it's always there and

1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:19.760
 you're always going to have to face it. I mean, your battle is sitting down and writing to

1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:28.560
 some number of words to a blank page. Do you have a process there with this battle? Do you have a

1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:36.160
 number of hours that you put in to sit down? I'm definitely a believer that even though

1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:41.920
 this battle is fought on the highest spiritual level, that the way you fight it is on the most

1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:48.720
 mundane. I'm sure it's like martial arts must be the same way. I mean, I go to the gym first thing

1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:57.040
 in the morning and I sort of am rehearsing myself. The gym is called resistance training, right?

1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:01.520
 You're working against resistance, right? And I don't want to go. I don't want to get out of bed.

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:12.320
 I hate to be, but I'm sort of fortifying myself to be ready for the day. And like I said, over

1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:17.440
 knock wood, over years, I've learned to sort of get into the right kind of mindset and it's not

1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:23.040
 as hard for me as it used to be. The real resistance, I think, for me, and I think this is true for

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:29.920
 anybody is the question of sort of what's the next idea? What's the next book? What's the next

1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:35.680
 project that you're going to work on? And when I ask that question, I'm asking it of the muse.

1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:41.120
 I'm kind of saying, what do you want me or I'm asking it of my unconscious? If we're looking

1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:46.240
 at Bruce Springsteen's albums, it's kind of, well, what's the next album? Now he's on Broadway.

1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:54.560
 That was a great idea, right? Where'd that come from? And then for him, what's after that?

1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:08.800
 That body of work is already alive. It already exists inside us kind of like a woman's biological

1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:18.000
 clock. And we have to serve it. And we have to otherwise it'll give us cancer. I don't mean

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.720
 to say that if anybody has cancer that they're not, but you know what I mean? It'll take its

1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:29.360
 revenge on us. So the next resistance to me is sort of a big aspect of it is what's next?

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:32.960
 When I finish the book I'm working on now, I'm not sure what I'm going to do next.

1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:44.080
 And let's see. At the same time, you have a sense that there's a Bruce Springsteen single line of

1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:50.720
 albums. So like it's already known somewhere in the universe what you're going to do next

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:55.040
 is the sense you have. In a sense, yes. I don't know if it's like predetermined,

1:04:55.040 --> 1:04:58.160
 you know, but it's, but there's something like that.

1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:05.200
 Yeah, I'd like to believe that there's, it's kind of like quantum mechanics, I guess.

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:13.440
 Once you observe it, maybe once you talk to the muse, it's one thing for sure,

1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:19.120
 it was always going to be that one thing. But really, in reality, it's a distribution,

1:05:19.120 --> 1:05:22.720
 it could be any number of things. Yeah, I think so. There's alternate realities.

1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:25.920
 Alternate realities, yeah. But they're not that far apart. I mean,

1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:29.440
 Bruce Springsteen is not going to write, you know, a Joni Mitchell song, you know,

1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:34.720
 no matter how hard he tries. I mean, he still did that, which is not a

1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:39.840
 Bruce Springsteen thing to do. So I think, I think you're being in retrospect.

1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:44.240
 I think it is a Bruce Springsteen thing to do. It's a next sort of evolution for him. Why not

1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:50.000
 take his music to there, you know? In retrospect, it all makes sense, I think.

1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:56.480
 Yeah. Because if you pull it off especially, do you visualize yourself completing the work?

1:05:57.360 --> 1:06:00.720
 Like Olympic athletes visualize getting the gold medal.

1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:07.360
 Do you, you know, that's, they go through, I mean, that's actually a really,

1:06:08.080 --> 1:06:14.880
 you can learn something from athletes on that is years out, certainly two, three years out,

1:06:14.880 --> 1:06:21.200
 some, some people do much longer every day. You visualize how the day of the, the championship

1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:26.720
 will go. They add down to, I mean, everything down to how will it feel to stand on the podium

1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:31.120
 and so on. Do you do anything like that in how you approach writing?

1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:37.040
 No. Because it's, because it is in the moment, I think, because it's such a mystery. You just

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:41.520
 don't know. I think it's different from sports. Right. Because you don't know the destiny.

1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:47.920
 There's no gold medal at the end. No. In fact, I would like to think and

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:54.000
 that as soon as you finish one, the next day you're on the other. And in fact,

1:06:54.000 --> 1:07:00.240
 hopefully you've already started the other. You're already, you know, 100 pages into the other

1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:04.400
 when you finish the first one. But it is a, it is a,

1:07:04.400 --> 1:07:13.360
 it's a journey. It's a process. I don't think it is a, in fact, I think it's very dangerous to

1:07:13.360 --> 1:07:19.680
 think that way. To think, oh, this, I'm going to win the Oscar. You know?

1:07:20.560 --> 1:07:26.720
 It's interesting for the creative process. It might be dangerous. It's, it's a, maybe you can,

1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:31.600
 like, why is that dangerous? Because I kind of, it's the ego.

1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:37.760
 It's the ego. Because you're giving yourself over to the ego. You know, I keep saying this

1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:44.160
 myself. My job, I'm a servant of the muse. I, I'm there to do what she tells me to do.

1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:50.400
 And if I'm suddenly think, oh, I'm really, I just want to, you know, whatever, the muse

1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:56.400
 doesn't like that. Yeah. And, you know, and she's on another dimension for me.

1:07:56.400 --> 1:08:02.640
 I'm trying to square that because I agree. I'm trying to square that with the,

1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:11.760
 I think there's a meditation to visualizing success in the athletic realm to where it focuses,

1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:18.400
 it removes everything else away to where you focus on this particular battle. I mean,

1:08:18.400 --> 1:08:28.240
 I think that you can do that in many kinds of ways. And in sports, the ego serves a more

1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:33.280
 important role, I think, than it does in writing. I mean, the ego, there's something.

1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:39.760
 Well, no, let me, when you say that, I know what you mean, Lex. I do think there is a sort of a,

1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:44.480
 you know, it's interesting to watch interviews with Steph Curry.

1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:53.600
 Yeah. Who's such, obviously such a nice guy, but he's got such tremendous self confidence,

1:08:54.560 --> 1:09:00.240
 you know, that it, but it's, it doesn't border on ego so much because he's worked so hard for it,

1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:07.280
 you know, but he knows, so he has visualized. He has visualized, maybe not so much winning,

1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:16.560
 you know, as just him being the best he can be, him being in the flow, you know, doing his thing

1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:22.560
 that he knows he can do. And I do think in the creative world, yeah, there is a sort of a thing

1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:30.000
 like that where you were, and, you know, a choreographer or filmmaker or whatever might

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:37.520
 be, do an internal thing where they're saying, I can make an Oscar winning movie, I can direct

1:09:37.520 --> 1:09:43.360
 this movie, you know, I'm banishing these thoughts that I'm not good enough, I can do that, I can,

1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:48.160
 I can edit it, I can score it, I can, you know, mump it, mump it, mump it, but I, and I don't

1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:54.240
 think that's really ego. I think that's, that's part of the process in a good way, like an athlete

1:09:54.240 --> 1:10:00.080
 does that. So extreme confidence is what some of the best athletes come with, and you think it's

1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:07.120
 possible to, as a writer, to have extreme confidence in yourself? I do think so, you know, that I'm

1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:14.160
 sure when John Lennon sat down to write a song, he felt like, shit, I can do this, you know?

1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:22.000
 I'm not so sure. I think, because the great artists I've seen, that you're haunted by

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:27.840
 self doubt, it's that resistance, I mean, the confidence. Yes, but I mean, I guess, but even

1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:32.320
 beyond the self, within the self, above the self doubt. Oh, it's the biggest, the bigger picture

1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:36.720
 of self belief, you know? Yeah, I'm freaking out, yeah, I'm worried that I'm not gonna be able to,

1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:40.720
 but you know, I know, I can do this. Yeah, and when you look at, when you take a bigger picture,

1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:53.120
 yeah. So the writing process, is it fundamentally lonely? No, because you're with your characters.

1:10:55.040 --> 1:11:02.000
 You are. So you really put yourself in the world? Absolutely. You know, I've written about this

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:06.720
 before, that I used to, my desk used to face a wall instead of seeing, and people would say, well,

1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:12.640
 don't you want to look out the window? But I'm in here. I mean, I'm seeing, you know, the Spartans,

1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:19.280
 I'm seeing, you know, whatever. And the characters that are on the page, or that you create,

1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:26.480
 are not accidents, you know? They're coming out of some issue, some deep issue that you have,

1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:30.720
 whether you realize it or not. You might not realize it till 20 years later, or somebody

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:37.520
 explains it to you. So your characters are kind of fascinating to you. And their dilemmas are

1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:43.600
 fascinating to you. And you're also trying to come to grips with them, you know, you sort of

1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:48.880
 see them through a glass darkly, you know, and you really want to see them more clearly.

1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:55.840
 So yeah, no, it's not lonely at all. In fact, I'm more lonely, sometimes later going out to dinner

1:11:55.840 --> 1:12:02.160
 with some people and actually talking to people. Do you miss the characters after it's over?

1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:09.120
 Let's say I have, I have affection for them, kind of like children that have gone off to college

1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:15.440
 and now are, you know, you only see them at Thanksgiving. Definitely I have affection for

1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:27.200
 them. Even the bad guys. Maybe especially the bad guys. Especially the bad guys. You've said that

1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:33.600
 writers, even successful writers are often not tough minded enough. I've read that in a post

1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:39.680
 that you have to be a professional in a way you handle your emotions. You have to be a bit of a

1:12:39.680 --> 1:12:49.440
 warrior to be a writer. So what are, what do you think makes a warrior? Is it, is a warrior born

1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:54.960
 or trained in the realm, in the bigger realm, in the realm of writing and the creative process?

1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:59.920
 I think, I think they're born to some extent, you have the gift, like you might have a gift as a

1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:06.080
 martial artist to do whatever martial artists do. But the training is the big thing. 90% training,

1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:14.480
 10%, 10% genetics. And, you know, I use another analogy other than warrior to, as far as writer,

1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:20.240
 and that's like to be a mother. If you think about, if you're a writer or any creative person,

1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:25.680
 you're giving birth to something, right? You're carrying a new life inside you. And in terms of

1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:33.440
 bravery, if your child, your two year old child is underneath a car is coming down the street,

1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:38.720
 the mother's going to like stop a Buick, you know, with her bare hands. So that's a,

1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:44.640
 that's another way to think about how a, how a writer has to think about, or any creative person

1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:47.760
 has to think about, I think, what they're, what they're doing, what this,

1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:51.120
 this child, this new creation that they're bringing forth.

1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:59.280
 Yeah. So the hard work that's underlying that I've just a couple of weeks ago talked to

1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:05.200
 just happened to be in the same room. Both gave talks area on the Huffington. I did this conversation

1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:13.680
 with her. I didn't know much about her before, before then, but she has recently been, she wrote

1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:19.680
 a couple of books and been promoting a lifestyle where she basically, she created the Huffington

1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:26.480
 post and she gave herself like, I don't know, 20 hours a day, just obsessed with her work.

1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:32.320
 And then she, she fainted, passed out and kind of, there was some health issues. And so she wrote

1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:39.520
 this book saying that, you know, sleep, basically you want to establish a lifestyle that doesn't

1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:44.480
 sacrifice health that's productive, but doesn't sacrifice health. She thinks you can have both

1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:50.880
 productivity and health, criticizing Elon Musk, who I've also spoken with for working too hard.

1:14:50.880 --> 1:15:00.720
 And thereby sacrificing, you know, being less effective than he could be. So I'm trying to

1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:08.400
 get at this balance between health and obsessively working at something and really working hard.

1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:13.840
 So I'm, what Ariane is talking about makes sense to me, but I'm a little bit torn to me.

1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:20.240
 Passion and reason do not overlap much or at all sometimes. Maybe I'm being too Russian,

1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:27.920
 but I feel madness and obsession does not care for health or sleep or diet or any of that.

1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:35.360
 And hard work is hard work and everything else can go to hell. So if you're really focused

1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:41.120
 on whether it's writing a book, it should, everything should just go to hell. Where do

1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:46.640
 you stand on this balance? How important is health for productivity? How important is it to

1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:55.760
 sort of get sleep and so on? On the health side. I mean, there was a period of my life when I was

1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:04.560
 just, I had no obligations and I was just living in a little house and just working nonstop, you

1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:10.320
 know? But even then, I would get up in the morning and I would have liver and eggs for breakfast

1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:14.880
 every day and I would do my, you know, exercise, whatever it was. But although I was still doing

1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:22.080
 like, you know, 18 hours a day, but I'm definitely, I kind of think of it sort of like an athlete does.

1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:29.200
 I'm sure that like Steph Curry is totally committed to winning championships and stuff

1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:33.760
 like that. But he has his family, he sees his family, you know, the family is always there.

1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:43.600
 He, I'm sure he eats, you know, perfect, great stuff, gets his sleep, you know, gets the train,

1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:47.280
 you know, the whatever a trainer does to him for his knees and his ankles and whatever.

1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:53.280
 So I, or Kobe Bryant or anybody that's a, it's operating at a high level. So I do think I'm

1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:59.280
 from that kind of the health school. The good thing about being a writer is you can't work for

1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:04.640
 many hours a day. You know, four hours is like the maximum I can work. I've never been able to work

1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:10.080
 more than that. I don't know how people do it. I've heard of people do 10, 12, I don't know how

1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:16.000
 they do it. So that gives you a lot of other time to, to do it. Optimize your health.

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.760
 Yeah. Because you need to, you're in training, you know, you're, you're really,

1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:25.120
 you're burning up a lot of B vitamins when you're working here at the, yeah, but

1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:30.400
 maybe it's a Russian thing with you Lex. Well, it's not even a Russian thing. I mean,

1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:35.280
 it also may be youth, you know, at 35, you can be crazy.

1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:40.320
 You know, that's, that's what they, they, they keep telling me, but I'm pretty sure I'll be

1:17:41.200 --> 1:17:48.000
 at it still at a later time too. I think it has to do with a career choice too. I think writing

1:17:48.640 --> 1:17:54.000
 is almost, from everything I've heard, it's almost impossible to do it more than a few hours

1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:59.840
 really well. The, when you start to get into certain disciplines, like with Elon Musk and me,

1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:08.000
 uh, engineering disciplines, that really there's a lot more non muse time needed.

1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:14.720
 Right, right. So, um, the crazy hours that you're talking, that you often are talking about,

1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:23.360
 have to be done. And it doesn't, uh, I think that's true. Yeah. So there's still the two,

1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:30.080
 three hours of muse time needed for truly genius ideas, but it's, uh, it's something, something

1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:39.440
 I certainly struggle with. Um, but yeah, I hear you a lot louder and clear on the health. So,

1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:47.600
 what does a perfect day look like for you? If we're talking about writing an hour by hour

1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:56.160
 schedule of a perfect day, um, I get up early, I go to the gym, I have breakfast with some friends

1:18:56.160 --> 1:19:05.200
 of mine. What's early by the way? That's like a how early 15 am. So we're talking really early.

1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:10.720
 Really early. Now I'm crazy early. It's ridiculously early. Yeah. But, and I haven't done that always,

1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:18.320
 but that's kind of what, what, what I'm on now. Um, so I'm in bed like when I'm with my,

1:19:18.320 --> 1:19:22.560
 my nephews that are like four years old and three years old, I'm in bed before them.

1:19:22.560 --> 1:19:28.480
 Okay. Um, you gotta be, you wake up, sorry, you said exercise first. Yeah.

1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:36.080
 And what does that look like? What's exercise for you? I go to the gym. Okay. Um, I, I have a

1:19:36.080 --> 1:19:41.840
 trainer. I have a couple of guys that I work out with and, uh, I'll, you know, it's maybe an hour,

1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:46.160
 maybe a little more. I'll do a little warm up before stretching afterwards, take a shower,

1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:53.200
 go have breakfast. Um, but it's an intense kind of a thing that I definitely don't want to do

1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:58.080
 that's hard, you know. So you feel like you've accomplished something. First thing. Yeah.

1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:03.520
 That's a big accomplishment of the day. At the same time, it's not like so hard that I'm completely

1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:10.400
 exhausted, you know? Um, and then I'll come home and handle whatever correspondence and stuff has

1:20:10.400 --> 1:20:16.320
 to be done. And then I work for maybe three hours and then I just sort of crash. The office is

1:20:16.320 --> 1:20:21.600
 closed. I turn the switch. I don't think about any, I don't think about anything. I don't think

1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:26.960
 about the work at all. Do you listen to, oh, you mean afterwards? After work. Once the office is

1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:31.760
 closed. But during, so this was like 12 to three kind of thing. Something like that. Yeah. Something

1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:37.200
 like that. Okay. Uh, you listen to music. No. Do you have anything? But that's just me. I mean,

1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:41.440
 I don't think, you know, but somebody could do it a million different ways. It's fascinating. You

1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:50.480
 know, the, I mean, you're also, of most, of many writers, you've really, uh, but like I've read

1:20:50.480 --> 1:20:56.240
 Stephen King, that writing is, you've optimized this conversation with the muse you're having,

1:20:56.240 --> 1:21:02.320
 that optimized, but you've at least, uh, thought about it. So what's, can you say a little bit

1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:10.880
 more about the trivialities of that process of, uh, like you said, facing the wall? What's,

1:21:11.680 --> 1:21:16.640
 do you have little rituals? You mean like the granular aspect of it? The granular aspects. Yeah.

1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:23.600
 I have little rituals. I do have all kinds of, which I'm not even going to tell you about. Sure.

1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:30.880
 But, um, the one thing, and I don't want to like to talk about this too much because it

1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:37.280
 sort of jinxes things, I think. But the one thing I, I do try to do is when I, when I sit down, I

1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:44.480
 immediately get into it. First, second. Yeah. I don't sit and fuck around with anything. I immediately

1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:50.160
 try to get into it as, as quickly as I can. And the other thing is that writing a book or

1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:55.440
 screenplay or anything like that is a process of multiple drafts. And it's the first draft,

1:21:56.080 --> 1:22:01.440
 that's where you're most with the muse, where you're going through the blank page. Like right now,

1:22:01.440 --> 1:22:05.760
 I'm on, I don't know what, the fifth or sixth, seventh draft of some other thing I'm working on.

1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:10.320
 So when I'm, I'm, I've got pages already written and I'm kind of reading them

1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:18.880
 afresh as I, as I go through the story. So it's not quite where I am now. It's not quite a deep

1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:26.320
 muse scenario. Partly it is, but it's also sort of bouncing back and forth between the different,

1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:30.800
 between the right brain and the left brain. I'm kind of looking at it and trying to evaluate it.

1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:33.920
 And then I'm going into it and try to change it a little bit.

1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:40.720
 And when, do you know, sit down and get right into it? Do you know the night before of what

1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:47.360
 that starting point is? I always try to stop. And I learned this, I think Hemingway wrote about

1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:52.240
 this or John Steinbeck or one of the, or maybe both of them to, to always stop when you kind of

1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:57.280
 know what's coming next. So you're not at a facing a chasm, you know?

1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:02.640
 Yeah. Okay. So, and afterwards, when you're done, the office is closed.

1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:06.320
 The office is closed. I let the muse take care of it, you know? And I don't want to,

1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:12.480
 and I think it's a very unhealthy thing to worry about or to think about any creative process.

1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:20.480
 You don't, I got a long walk later, think about. Yeah. Then I will sort of keep my mind open to it,

1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:26.080
 but I won't be like obsessing about it. Because actually on walks, sometimes things will pop in

1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:32.080
 your head, you know, and you'll go, Oh, I should change that. But that's not your ego doing it.

1:23:32.080 --> 1:23:36.320
 That's the deeper level. Okay. So how does the day end?

1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:43.200
 Okay. So how does the day end? In terms of writing? So yeah, the writing, well, no, writing the

1:23:43.200 --> 1:23:48.240
 office door closes. And then the rest of the day, just do whatever the hell.

1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:53.680
 Maybe go out to dinner. My girlfriend is not here now. She's in New York work and we'll

1:23:54.320 --> 1:23:59.200
 make dinner or whatever. Go out to dinner, something like that. And maybe, maybe I'll

1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:08.160
 read something, nothing heavy. And I go to bed pretty early. And the gym is a big thing for me.

1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:11.920
 I'll already, sorry, probably with you, like with you with martial arts. The night before,

1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:18.560
 I'll be, I'll be visualizing what I have to do the next day, and getting myself psyched up for

1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:24.000
 that. And then let's conk out like a light and wake up with the crack of dawn.

1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:29.760
 So looking out into the future this year, the next few years,

1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:32.720
 what do you think the muse has in store for you?

1:24:34.800 --> 1:24:40.800
 I don't think you can ever know. It's probably something along the same. I really believe,

1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:46.640
 you know, there's that exercise where you, where they say to you, visualize yourself

1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:50.640
 five years in the future and then write a letter to your, from that person to yourself.

1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:55.120
 I don't believe in that at all because I don't think you can, you know, there's a line in

1:24:56.320 --> 1:25:01.520
 out of Africa that God made the world around so that we couldn't see too far ahead.

1:25:03.680 --> 1:25:10.400
 You just don't know as a writer or as a creator. I person, you know, I never knew, my first book

1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:16.480
 was A Legend of Bagger Vance. I hadn't, before that happened, I had no clue that I was going to be

1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:22.160
 writing anything like that on that subject, anything at all, no clue until it just sort of came.

1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:26.160
 And then when I've, when that was done, people said, well, you got to write another one. I had no

1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:33.520
 idea what it was, which was going to be Gates of Fire. No clue. So, so if somebody sat me down

1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:40.400
 at the start of that and asked the question, I would have been in crazy to say it. So I just hope

1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:46.000
 as, as the future unfolds, that I'm open to it, you know.

1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:54.000
 Well, I think I speak for a lot of people in saying that we look forward to what that looks

1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:57.280
 like. Stephen, thank you so much for talking today. It was fun.

1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:01.840
 You got the best job in the world going around talking to people that you want to talk to,

1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:05.200
 and that they will talk to you, you know. So thank you for doing it.

1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:08.720
 Hey, thank you for the great questions you made me think. I've certainly a bunch of questions

1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:12.720
 I've never ever answered before. Awesome. So thanks a lot. Great.

1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:16.960

1:26:55.760 --> 1:27:01.840
 Are you paralyzed by fear? That's a good sign. Fear is good. Like self doubt,

1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:08.640
 fear is an indicator. Fear tells us what we have to do. Remember one rule of thumb,

1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:14.960
 the more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.

1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:31.040
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
