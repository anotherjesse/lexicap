00:00.000 --> 00:04.120
 Talking about exciting thing for an engineer, the same

00:04.120 --> 00:07.140
 Snapdragon that goes to a phone and it can go to a Galaxy

00:07.140 --> 00:10.860
 phone, for example, Samsung, the same, not a special one, went

00:10.860 --> 00:16.060
 all the way to Mars. You expect to have a full day of battery

00:16.060 --> 00:22.220
 life. But then you wanted to not be sending data into 10 or

00:22.220 --> 00:25.800
 100 megabits, you want gigabits, you wanted to be able to

00:25.800 --> 00:29.860
 have eight core processors, you want to have a GPU with rate

00:29.860 --> 00:33.160
 tracing, you want to have all of those things that you can

00:33.160 --> 00:39.560
 only get into sometimes a desktop PC. To do all of that in

00:39.560 --> 00:41.140
 your phone is an incredible thing.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.080
 Some people raise concerns about there not being enough

00:44.080 --> 00:48.240
 studies about the effects of 5G on the human body. It's 5G

00:48.240 --> 00:48.880
 safe.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.200
 The following is a conversation with Cristiano Aman, the

00:55.200 --> 00:59.320
 CEO of Qualcomm, the company that's one of the leaders in the

00:59.320 --> 01:02.760
 world in the space of mobile communication and computation.

01:03.100 --> 01:08.840
 That's 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G that connects billions of phones and

01:09.000 --> 01:12.680
 the Snapdragon processor and system on a chip that is the

01:12.680 --> 01:16.040
 brain of most of the premium Android phones in the world.

01:16.680 --> 01:20.000
 This is a Lex Freeman podcast. To support it, please check out

01:20.000 --> 01:23.400
 our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

01:23.640 --> 01:25.680
 here's Cristiano Aman.

01:25.680 --> 01:29.320
 You are originally from Brazil, so let me ask the most

01:29.320 --> 01:32.080
 important question, the most profound question, the biggest

01:32.080 --> 01:35.160
 question. Who's the greatest football soccer player of all

01:35.160 --> 01:35.400
 time?

01:35.400 --> 01:39.720
 Look, everybody's going to say Pele. And actually, I was born

01:39.720 --> 01:45.680
 during the game of Brazil and Italy that Pele gave Brazil

01:45.680 --> 01:51.080
 the championship. Actually, my dad tells me that the doctor

01:51.080 --> 01:55.800
 had a TV on at the delivery room. But so everybody will say

01:55.800 --> 02:00.520
 Pele, but I really like Ronaldo. The first Ronaldo, the first

02:00.520 --> 02:03.560
 Ronaldo, I really like him. That's my favorite player.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.000
 By the way, not everybody would say Pele. But we should leave

02:08.000 --> 02:10.720
 that on the table and agree to disagree.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.160
 Brazilians will say Pele.

02:12.160 --> 02:17.960
 Yes. There's other countries around that region that made

02:17.960 --> 02:22.960
 you may disagree a little. Very aware. Qualcomm is largely

02:22.960 --> 02:28.200
 responsible for 5G and some of the greatest processors in our

02:28.200 --> 02:31.640
 smartphones ever built. So we got communication and

02:31.640 --> 02:36.880
 computation tech that impacts probably billions of people. So

02:36.880 --> 02:40.560
 if you zoom out, use a human, look at humans on earth in

02:40.560 --> 02:47.560
 general, does it blow your mind that we have these billions of

02:47.560 --> 02:51.160
 smartphones communicating? And each of them have the

02:51.160 --> 02:54.640
 computational power? You know, you talk about 10 billion

02:54.640 --> 02:59.840
 transistors. That's a million times more than 50 years ago in

02:59.840 --> 03:03.600
 the best computers in the world. Like if you just zoom out as a

03:03.600 --> 03:06.080
 human, does that blow your mind?

03:06.200 --> 03:09.760
 Absolutely. Look, one of the reasons I think I love this

03:09.760 --> 03:14.040
 company is we know that the technology we develop can change

03:14.040 --> 03:17.280
 the world. And I'll tell you one more thing. Beyond the amount of

03:17.280 --> 03:20.200
 processing power that you have now and the palm of your hands

03:20.200 --> 03:23.160
 and being every one of the word is connected with broadband

03:23.160 --> 03:26.760
 technology. The smartphone is also mankind's largest

03:26.760 --> 03:28.920
 development platform. There's nothing like it.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.840
 So you respect both the hardware and the software?

03:31.880 --> 03:35.800
 Both. Both. If aliens were observing earth over the past

03:35.800 --> 03:38.800
 50 to 70 years, how do you think they would describe this

03:38.800 --> 03:45.120
 particular turmoil, fun things going on on the surface of this

03:45.160 --> 03:46.920
 particular little planet?

03:47.840 --> 03:53.240
 We live in interesting times. In one time, we see incredible

03:53.240 --> 03:57.120
 development of technology for mankind just to happen in the

03:57.120 --> 04:02.880
 last century. You know, the night from 1900 to the 2000, it

04:02.880 --> 04:07.920
 was incredible development. Just look 2000 or 22 years ago, how

04:07.920 --> 04:10.800
 far we're coming and where we go in with technology. It's

04:10.800 --> 04:11.760
 incredible.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.200
 What do you think they would notice? So there's road

04:14.200 --> 04:18.120
 networks, there's all kinds of networks, there's, there's lights

04:18.120 --> 04:21.000
 that keep popping up cities, bringing up like it from an

04:21.000 --> 04:22.200
 alien perspective, you're observing.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.200
 Well, what I'm going to tell you is you have this contrast of

04:25.240 --> 04:28.360
 incredible development of technology, but then you see

04:28.360 --> 04:30.960
 some of the things that are happening right now, which is

04:31.160 --> 04:34.720
 probably will not expect them to happen on the 21st century,

04:34.720 --> 04:39.240
 just won't happen in Ukraine. So I think that that will be a

04:39.240 --> 04:41.800
 more puzzling question for the aliens, I would imagine.

04:42.440 --> 04:45.440
 The new technology is kind of impressive. Actually, they might

04:45.440 --> 04:48.520
 not be so puzzling because that's just human nature revealing

04:48.520 --> 04:50.520
 itself as it has throughout human history.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.040
 That's correct.

04:52.720 --> 04:56.320
 Let's talk about wireless communication. So Qualcomm was

04:56.360 --> 05:00.120
 instrumental in developing 5G. Now you were with Qualcomm since

05:00.120 --> 05:04.640
 the early days, the good old 90s with the 2G. But what is

05:04.640 --> 05:09.800
 5G, including sub six gigahertz 5G and middle matter wave 5G?

05:10.080 --> 05:13.560
 How does it work? And maybe the most important question is how

05:13.560 --> 05:15.320
 will it change the world in the coming years?

05:15.880 --> 05:19.640
 When we set ourselves to develop 5G, and, you know, we look

05:19.640 --> 05:23.200
 at this, every generation of technology had a problem to be

05:23.200 --> 05:26.640
 solved, right? So you mentioned 2G, 2G challenge, the

05:26.640 --> 05:30.280
 challenge of CDMA was, can we give every person on Earth a

05:30.280 --> 05:34.080
 cell phone? That was, can you get to a technology that you can

05:34.080 --> 05:38.400
 basically allow everyone to have a mobile phone? 3G was about

05:38.440 --> 05:42.120
 the ability to connect that to the internet. I think 4G was

05:42.120 --> 05:45.640
 broadband and with 4G was about have the ability for you to

05:45.640 --> 05:48.280
 have a computer in the palm of your hand. We just talk about

05:48.280 --> 05:52.200
 that. 5G, the challenge was a little bit different. It's how

05:52.200 --> 05:55.360
 do we build a technology for a society that is going to be a

05:55.360 --> 05:58.640
 hundred percent connected to the cloud? How do we provide a

05:58.640 --> 06:02.720
 technology that is going to be the last mile connectivity for

06:02.720 --> 06:08.360
 everything? So 5G is basically been designed, eliminate all

06:08.360 --> 06:13.120
 issues with data congestion, whether you are in a stadium,

06:13.120 --> 06:16.000
 we talk about soccer, you're in a stadium and everyone should

06:16.000 --> 06:20.040
 be ability to have access to broadband. So deal with congestion.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.360
 Deal with the fact that not only people, but billions of

06:23.360 --> 06:27.760
 things need to be connected. Create a technology that for the

06:27.760 --> 06:31.280
 first time in Warless, you could deliver mission critical

06:31.280 --> 06:38.000
 services. Warless used to up to 4G is is best effort. In 5G, it

06:38.000 --> 06:41.120
 can guarantee that you're connected with the cloud. And

06:41.120 --> 06:47.280
 then the last point of that is provide this fabric that will

06:47.280 --> 06:51.360
 allow us as a society to look at things that are not connected

06:51.360 --> 06:55.360
 and say that's the exception. That's why we made a comparison

06:55.360 --> 06:57.560
 in the early days of 5G that that's going to be like

06:57.560 --> 07:01.160
 electricity. Right now you don't have a discussion about what

07:01.160 --> 07:03.800
 is the use cases for electricity. You don't talk about that

07:03.800 --> 07:06.680
 anymore. You just assume it's there and that's how we think

07:06.680 --> 07:10.440
 about everything connected to the cloud. That's what 5G is

07:10.440 --> 07:11.960
 and that's the role of 5G.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.400
 So first of all, everything connected to the cloud is

07:15.400 --> 07:18.120
 interesting because the space of everything is constantly

07:18.120 --> 07:21.480
 increasing. That is correct. You know, I don't think the

07:21.480 --> 07:23.720
 refrigerator over there looks kind of smart, but I don't think

07:23.720 --> 07:28.280
 it's connected yet to the cloud. So this includes Internet of

07:28.280 --> 07:32.200
 Things. What is the full space of everything? The full space of

07:32.200 --> 07:37.160
 everything is it's maybe going back to where you start

07:37.160 --> 07:40.200
 defining Qualcomm. Qualcomm is about communications and

07:40.200 --> 07:44.680
 advanced computers for low power devices. And can we make

07:44.680 --> 07:49.160
 everything smart? You know, it can range from the robot you

07:49.160 --> 07:53.480
 have right now on the floor, to your refrigerator, to a

07:53.480 --> 08:02.600
 camera, to, you know, machines and manufacturing, to retail,

08:02.600 --> 08:06.600
 etc. I can give you some examples. When we think of

08:06.600 --> 08:11.400
 something as simple as going to the grocery shop, we see

08:11.400 --> 08:15.640
 technology now with something that stuff would be working

08:15.640 --> 08:19.480
 with companies like Walmart, electronic shelf labels, the

08:19.480 --> 08:22.520
 ability for you to have smart cameras that can look at shelves

08:22.520 --> 08:25.240
 and can the camera is smart enough to say some product

08:25.240 --> 08:28.280
 needs to be replenished, ability to see what's trapped. So

08:28.280 --> 08:32.360
 it's about really providing processor connectivity,

08:32.360 --> 08:36.920
 artificial intelligence to everything. And I think that's

08:36.920 --> 08:40.440
 one of the largest addressable markets we have for

08:40.440 --> 08:42.680
 technology because you can't really define everything.

08:42.680 --> 08:45.960
 Right, exactly. It's a nice market because it keeps growing

08:45.960 --> 08:51.320
 potentially exponentially in speed. What about coverage? So

08:51.320 --> 08:54.440
 how are we doing on the everything part? So, you know,

08:54.440 --> 08:57.560
 there is, like I mentioned, sub six gigahertz 5G and

08:57.560 --> 09:02.040
 there's a millimeter wave 5G. So not all 5G is made the

09:02.040 --> 09:05.480
 same. So there's a speed, there's a bandwidth thing. And

09:05.480 --> 09:10.040
 then there's coverage. How many people get to enjoy today?

09:10.040 --> 09:13.640
 And how does the progress of the next 5, 10, 20, 30, 50

09:13.640 --> 09:15.720
 years you think it looks like in terms of coverage?

09:15.720 --> 09:17.960
 Great topic of conversation. So let's talk about this.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.560
 When I meet with regulators across the globe, I tell them

09:24.280 --> 09:28.840
 resistance is futile, allocate every spectrum to wireless.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.640
 Every spectrum needs to be allocated to wireless. The

09:31.640 --> 09:38.120
 reality is when we start moving from CDMA to OFDMA, we knew

09:38.120 --> 09:42.760
 that there's this industry has done a lot to get more bits

09:42.760 --> 09:48.680
 per hertz. But the reality is the massive amount of

09:48.680 --> 09:54.280
 improvements that is required in capacity and in speed, you

09:54.280 --> 09:58.360
 need more spectrum. You know, there's there's not so much

09:58.360 --> 10:01.000
 we can rely on more bits per hertz. You just need more

10:01.000 --> 10:05.880
 spectrum. And if you look, for example, what carriers

10:05.880 --> 10:09.800
 since the 2G era, they participate in different

10:09.800 --> 10:13.320
 license and auctions and every spectrum they accumulated

10:13.320 --> 10:17.960
 from 2G or 3G or 4G, all of that you may be able to get

10:17.960 --> 10:23.240
 one or two channels max of subsets, which is a channel

10:23.240 --> 10:26.600
 is about 100 megahertz or 200 megahertz. And that's it.

10:26.600 --> 10:30.840
 So we need more spectrum. So 5G has been designed to work

10:30.840 --> 10:34.840
 across every spectrum from the low frequency bands.

10:34.840 --> 10:38.440
 That's what we call the sub six. But you needed more. You

10:38.440 --> 10:41.480
 needed to go to the millimeter wave. So that's why

10:41.480 --> 10:45.400
 5G is a technology that you can deploy from 450 megahertz as

10:45.400 --> 10:52.600
 an example or 600 or 700, all the way to in the 42

10:52.600 --> 10:56.200
 gigahertz. And that's where millimeter wave comes

10:56.200 --> 11:00.520
 into the picture. Now, let's now connect this to your question

11:00.520 --> 11:06.680
 about coverage of 5G. The easiest thing to do is to

11:06.680 --> 11:11.800
 deploy 5G in the new spectrum you can get, which is in the

11:11.800 --> 11:14.840
 sub six, you see bands being auctioned across the globe

11:14.840 --> 11:18.440
 into 3.5 gigahertz. There's nothing special about the

11:18.440 --> 11:20.360
 band. Is this the one on one that was available because

11:20.360 --> 11:24.120
 everything else being useful for G and you can deploy on

11:24.120 --> 11:27.320
 that going to existing cell towers and just put a new

11:27.320 --> 11:29.880
 equipment without having to build new towers. But when we

11:29.880 --> 11:33.000
 go to technologies just millimeter wave, then you

11:33.000 --> 11:35.960
 have to build more dense networks. You need to build

11:35.960 --> 11:38.680
 more stations because a deployment in that case

11:38.680 --> 11:41.560
 looked like a Wi Fi deployment. It's almost like Wi Fi

11:41.560 --> 11:44.760
 access points. When you need to build more stations, you

11:44.760 --> 11:49.080
 need permits, you need to build fiber so it takes more

11:49.080 --> 11:51.880
 time to densify. So what you see happening is

11:51.880 --> 11:56.200
 coverage has been built fast with sub six across the

11:56.200 --> 12:00.040
 globe. But now the United States also have the sub six. So

12:00.040 --> 12:04.600
 that gets you to coverage very fast. But millimeter wave,

12:04.600 --> 12:08.040
 it's moving. And if you all will say, for example,

12:08.040 --> 12:11.720
 Verizon, United States has had a leadership in building

12:11.720 --> 12:15.000
 millimeter wave. It takes time. I'll say cities like

12:15.000 --> 12:18.760
 Chicago, Manhattan, starting to get coverage.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.920
 It will be a process over a number of years as you build

12:22.920 --> 12:26.760
 those different access point type networks, but it's

12:26.760 --> 12:31.400
 inevitable. There's not enough spectrum. So every 5G

12:31.400 --> 12:34.200
 operators just a matter of time will have millimeter

12:34.200 --> 12:38.360
 wave as well. Resistance is futile. Okay, so for

12:38.360 --> 12:43.160
 millimeter wave, we need density of access points. And

12:43.160 --> 12:48.200
 what's the biggest resistance for Qualcomm, for human

12:48.200 --> 12:52.840
 civilization? Is it politicians, regulators,

12:52.840 --> 12:58.200
 federal regulators? Is it individual humans? Is it

12:58.200 --> 13:01.080
 not enough money from the consumer perspective? Like

13:01.080 --> 13:03.960
 who is the biggest pain in the butt? From a Qualcomm

13:03.960 --> 13:06.680
 standpoint, but answering the question about what it

13:06.680 --> 13:10.680
 takes to build all this technology. I think regulators

13:10.680 --> 13:13.720
 across the board understood the importance of 5G. I

13:13.720 --> 13:16.440
 have not met a regulator that said it's really

13:16.440 --> 13:18.760
 important to be late on 5G. I don't think anybody

13:18.760 --> 13:21.800
 wants to be late on 5G. And as a result, we've seen

13:21.800 --> 13:24.040
 enormous amount of progress in getting spectrum

13:24.040 --> 13:28.360
 allocated to 5G. I think the real issue is the time

13:28.360 --> 13:31.880
 that it takes to build infrastructure. You know,

13:31.880 --> 13:34.840
 investment in 5G infrastructure, especially millimeter

13:34.840 --> 13:37.880
 wave, is like building roads and ports. It's critical

13:37.880 --> 13:40.440
 infrastructure. And those things take time. Like one of

13:40.440 --> 13:42.280
 the number one obstacles you're going to hear from

13:42.280 --> 13:45.960
 operators is site permit. You know, sometimes they have

13:45.960 --> 13:49.480
 to negotiate municipality by municipality about

13:49.480 --> 13:52.360
 permits to get new cell sites. But you know, the

13:52.360 --> 13:55.640
 networks will be densified and you're going to need

13:55.640 --> 13:58.920
 all of the capacity for the promise of the fully

13:58.920 --> 14:01.800
 immersive augmented reality that will replace

14:01.800 --> 14:04.760
 phones and everything being connected 100% of the

14:04.760 --> 14:07.400
 time. This would not be a conversation with the

14:07.400 --> 14:11.320
 CEO if I did not ask questions that make you

14:11.320 --> 14:15.400
 nervous. Some people raise concerns about there not

14:15.400 --> 14:17.800
 being enough studies about the effects of 5G on the

14:17.800 --> 14:23.880
 human body. Is 5G safe? Look, I have a very simple

14:23.880 --> 14:32.520
 answer to this question. As we build new capabilities

14:32.520 --> 14:36.760
 such as 5G, power is going down. Especially when

14:36.760 --> 14:39.800
 you think about reducing the number of base

14:39.800 --> 14:43.960
 stations, the networks becoming more dense. So as

14:43.960 --> 14:49.240
 you do that, the power becomes lower. Power radiated

14:49.240 --> 14:52.440
 from the phone and from the tower. As you get

14:52.440 --> 14:54.680
 closer to the tower, you don't need that much power

14:54.680 --> 14:59.480
 to reach the tower. So as we move from 4G to 5G, I

14:59.480 --> 15:02.520
 think we see a reduction in the amount of powers

15:02.520 --> 15:06.520
 required to close the radio link. Now, also you

15:06.520 --> 15:09.080
 have a number of organizations. The FCC, for

15:09.080 --> 15:12.600
 example, has rigorous programs, which they do a

15:12.600 --> 15:18.520
 lot of tests to validate the safety of those

15:18.520 --> 15:21.880
 devices. And I think we have has been a model for

15:21.880 --> 15:25.960
 other countries also to adopt the same things.

15:25.960 --> 15:29.720
 Cellular has been around for a number of decades now.

15:29.720 --> 15:33.160
 I think smartphones are most beloved device

15:33.160 --> 15:38.120
 today. And I would argue how it's difficult to

15:38.120 --> 15:41.640
 answer those questions. But I'll argue that the

15:41.640 --> 15:47.000
 data to date, have we seen in 3G and 4G,

15:47.000 --> 15:52.200
 you know, has shown that a lot of the initial

15:52.200 --> 15:56.440
 concerns were not valid. We look at 5G, even though

15:56.440 --> 15:59.080
 it's new, it's just less power. So we look at

15:59.080 --> 16:02.600
 from a physics standpoint. So from a physics,

16:02.600 --> 16:06.200
 from a biology perspective, there's a lot of

16:06.200 --> 16:10.440
 evidence, there's studies that show that it's not

16:10.440 --> 16:13.480
 dangerous, that it is in fact safe. However, the

16:13.480 --> 16:15.240
 concern that people have is when you scale

16:15.240 --> 16:19.640
 technology exponentially, how will that change

16:19.640 --> 16:21.800
 human civilization? I mean, that doesn't apply to

16:21.800 --> 16:24.840
 5G, that applies to every technology. You said

16:24.840 --> 16:28.360
 smartphone is the most beloved device, but love

16:28.360 --> 16:32.760
 sometimes hurts. The impact on society, we don't

16:32.760 --> 16:34.760
 know. And there's a little bit of fear, there's

16:34.760 --> 16:37.800
 both excitement and fear. It's a great topic, a

16:37.800 --> 16:39.960
 conversation, actually. So let me give you

16:39.960 --> 16:41.960
 my perspective on this. And you started to see

16:41.960 --> 16:43.800
 some things actually happening right now. So

16:43.800 --> 16:47.000
 let me step back. And let's talk about the fact

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
 that we are in a fully interconnected society.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.040
 That when you look of the situations today, we

16:56.040 --> 17:00.200
 talk about smartphones, largest development

17:00.200 --> 17:05.560
 platform, so much now of our life, we are

17:05.560 --> 17:09.320
 connected to the smartphone. And we are all

17:09.320 --> 17:12.440
 connected and we're connected. And then we're

17:12.440 --> 17:16.040
 building digital twins of everything. So when

17:16.040 --> 17:17.640
 you look at that picture, when you look at the

17:17.640 --> 17:22.200
 picture of this connected society, you started

17:22.200 --> 17:25.640
 to have the following thoughts, which I think

17:25.640 --> 17:27.880
 are very healthy, which means in the same way

17:27.880 --> 17:31.080
 that in the physical world, you're entitled to

17:31.080 --> 17:33.960
 some rights, you have obligations, and there's

17:33.960 --> 17:37.960
 a lot of things that protect your

17:37.960 --> 17:41.960
 integrity. I think as a rule, we're going to

17:41.960 --> 17:44.200
 see the society evolving, so those things

17:44.200 --> 17:48.600
 extend to your digital being of people and

17:48.600 --> 17:50.920
 things. And I think it's just natural. It's just

17:50.920 --> 17:54.120
 natural. It's just a natural path. And you

17:54.120 --> 17:55.880
 started to see things like that. For example,

17:55.880 --> 17:59.800
 the Europeans have done a lot in this area.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.440
 I'll say the Europeans probably ahead in the

18:02.440 --> 18:05.560
 United States, thinking about privacy laws,

18:05.560 --> 18:08.440
 digital privacy law. Most recently, the DMA,

18:08.440 --> 18:10.520
 the Digital Markets Act, which I think is a

18:10.520 --> 18:13.880
 great thing. I think we believe there's

18:13.880 --> 18:17.800
 incredible thought into enabling ability to

18:17.800 --> 18:19.640
 regulate the digital market so that there's

18:19.640 --> 18:22.200
 innovation and competitions. Not a single

18:22.200 --> 18:25.080
 company can control all the data and then

18:25.080 --> 18:28.760
 decide how things are going to work on the

18:28.760 --> 18:30.840
 digital realm. And even if we think about

18:30.840 --> 18:32.760
 the potential things like the metaverses,

18:32.760 --> 18:34.440
 we're connecting physical and digital

18:34.440 --> 18:37.400
 spaces. So I think it's a natural evolution.

18:37.400 --> 18:41.240
 Of course, regulation and laws always

18:41.240 --> 18:45.080
 follow technology. But the fact that we're

18:45.080 --> 18:47.000
 moving toward interconnected society,

18:47.000 --> 18:50.440
 there's no going back. We are a fully

18:50.440 --> 18:52.520
 interconnected society. But there is

18:52.520 --> 18:55.560
 opportunity to think about how the

18:55.560 --> 18:59.400
 digital to win should people and

18:59.400 --> 19:00.920
 governments should think about it so

19:00.920 --> 19:03.240
 that we get the best of a technology

19:03.240 --> 19:06.040
 without any downside. Yeah. So when you say

19:06.040 --> 19:07.400
 digital to win, that's one of the other

19:07.400 --> 19:08.680
 things you're excited about, which is the

19:08.680 --> 19:11.240
 metaverse, are basically building worlds

19:11.240 --> 19:13.720
 in the digital space. And you have to

19:13.720 --> 19:15.640
 start to think about all the basic human

19:15.640 --> 19:19.400
 rights that transfer from our physical

19:19.400 --> 19:22.200
 meat vehicles out to the digital copies

19:22.200 --> 19:24.040
 of ourselves, representations of ourselves.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.480
 That's really important to think about.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.000
 The thing you mentioned about regulators

19:27.000 --> 19:28.680
 that has been, this is me speaking,

19:28.680 --> 19:31.480
 frustrating, is like you said, they follow

19:31.480 --> 19:34.840
 technology. So sometimes they don't get

19:34.840 --> 19:38.120
 the technology at all. So they're very

19:38.120 --> 19:41.640
 clumsy in writing laws that censor that

19:41.640 --> 19:43.800
 technology in interesting ways. They

19:43.800 --> 19:45.720
 mean good, but they can do a lot of

19:45.720 --> 19:49.320
 unintended damage. Now both, it's a dance.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.480
 It's a beautiful dance, but I just wish

19:51.480 --> 19:53.880
 governments were better dance partners.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.480
 I just see what they're kind of writing

19:55.480 --> 19:59.000
 now about regulating social media and

19:59.000 --> 20:00.680
 platforms like YouTube. And it's just

20:00.680 --> 20:02.920
 really, really clumsy. They don't

20:02.920 --> 20:04.440
 understand how machine learning works.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.760
 I recommend their systems work. And I just

20:06.760 --> 20:08.600
 wish they kind of caught up a little

20:08.600 --> 20:10.200
 more because it's really important to be

20:10.200 --> 20:13.480
 great at regulation. But also it's

20:13.480 --> 20:15.400
 important to let companies flourish and

20:15.400 --> 20:17.080
 embrace this new wave of technology.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.960
 That weird dance. I'm more and more

20:19.960 --> 20:22.680
 learning, looking at public policy, how

20:22.680 --> 20:25.800
 much positive government can do and how

20:25.800 --> 20:27.960
 much clumsy negative it can do.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.360
 Unintentionally, just out of sheer

20:30.360 --> 20:32.520
 incompetence or lack of curiosity about

20:32.520 --> 20:36.760
 tech. That's my rant about regulators.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.480
 I think it's a valid point. As I said

20:39.480 --> 20:41.480
 before, I think the Europeans probably

20:41.480 --> 20:44.120
 have a very good framework, but the

20:44.120 --> 20:48.120
 way I'll think about it, we depend on

20:48.120 --> 20:50.600
 have the ability to innovate. We depend

20:50.600 --> 20:53.160
 on the free markets. We depend on the

20:53.160 --> 20:57.560
 ability to create technology that

20:57.560 --> 20:59.720
 will be disruptive. But at the same time,

20:59.720 --> 21:01.480
 I think the tech companies probably

21:01.480 --> 21:03.800
 should spend time helping governments

21:03.800 --> 21:06.520
 understand, helping understand ahead of

21:06.520 --> 21:07.800
 time so that they can be better

21:07.800 --> 21:09.800
 prepared.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.560
 Let's talk about one of my favorite

21:11.560 --> 21:15.640
 topics. Snap Dragon. So Snap Dragon is a

21:15.640 --> 21:18.200
 system on a chip. This processor has

21:18.200 --> 21:21.480
 probably powered billions of smartphones

21:21.480 --> 21:23.880
 over its pretty long history now, a

21:23.880 --> 21:26.280
 decade and a half maybe. So it's

21:26.280 --> 21:28.040
 constantly iterating. There's constant

21:28.040 --> 21:29.320
 just like a turmoil of beautiful

21:29.320 --> 21:31.240
 innovations happening. So last year was

21:31.240 --> 21:34.040
 Snap Dragon 888. It was the main one

21:34.040 --> 21:36.280
 with the 5 nanometer and this year it's

21:36.280 --> 21:40.600
 Snap Dragon 8 Gen 1. It's a new naming

21:40.600 --> 21:43.560
 scheme. Okay, what's the sexiest, most

21:43.560 --> 21:45.800
 beautiful idea or concept to you about

21:45.800 --> 21:48.120
 Snap Dragon? Let's start there. The way I

21:48.120 --> 21:49.960
 will describe it, and I think the reason

21:49.960 --> 21:54.200
 we have been successful with it, is to

21:54.200 --> 21:58.360
 really understand how to build a

21:58.360 --> 22:00.920
 platform, a single chip, like a single

22:00.920 --> 22:05.240
 chip, that will have every single

22:05.240 --> 22:08.040
 capability if you want to make this

22:08.040 --> 22:10.200
 smartphone and the palm of your hand,

22:10.200 --> 22:12.440
 you know, something that has all of

22:12.440 --> 22:13.960
 your computing needs. And it was the

22:13.960 --> 22:15.960
 ability to get, from an engineering

22:15.960 --> 22:18.760
 standpoint, ability to get into a

22:18.760 --> 22:22.760
 single chip of not only all possible

22:22.760 --> 22:24.680
 connectivity technology, from cell

22:24.680 --> 22:26.920
 alert, to Wi Fi, to Bluetooth, to every

22:26.920 --> 22:29.960
 single constellation of satellites for

22:29.960 --> 22:32.840
 position location. But at the same time,

22:32.840 --> 22:36.200
 you know, a very power efficient, you

22:36.200 --> 22:38.200
 know, single threaded, multi threaded

22:38.200 --> 22:43.080
 CPU. A GPU for your, all of your

22:43.080 --> 22:46.040
 graphic demands, gaming, fastest growing

22:46.040 --> 22:49.960
 segment for gaming, is mobile gaming.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.040
 An artificial intelligence processor,

22:52.040 --> 22:53.800
 which we call the neural processor

22:53.800 --> 22:58.440
 unit. And then a video engine, a

22:58.440 --> 23:00.680
 multimedia engine for every single

23:00.680 --> 23:04.200
 application, audio, everything. So it's

23:04.200 --> 23:07.880
 a single chip that has every single

23:07.880 --> 23:09.800
 computing technology you need in the

23:09.800 --> 23:13.240
 phone. And what's exciting about it, is

23:13.240 --> 23:14.840
 what we already knew, for example, when

23:14.840 --> 23:16.280
 you think about camera or computer

23:16.280 --> 23:19.000
 vision, you see that the

23:19.000 --> 23:22.120
 advancements in the technology now

23:22.120 --> 23:25.480
 happens in the smartphone first, versus

23:25.480 --> 23:27.560
 additional camera. So the beauty about

23:27.560 --> 23:30.600
 the Snapdragon is, we always have this

23:30.600 --> 23:34.360
 thing with within Qualcomm. The phone,

23:34.360 --> 23:36.680
 it's small, you have to be able to hold

23:36.680 --> 23:38.600
 it, you're going to touch your face so

23:38.600 --> 23:42.120
 you cannot be hot, you have to manage

23:42.120 --> 23:45.960
 thermals, you expect to have a full day

23:45.960 --> 23:48.840
 of battery life. But then you wanted to

23:48.840 --> 23:53.080
 not be sending data into 10 or 100

23:53.080 --> 23:55.800
 megabits, you want gigabits, you wanted

23:55.800 --> 23:58.600
 to be able to have eight core processors,

23:58.600 --> 24:01.240
 you want to have a GPU with ray tracing,

24:01.240 --> 24:03.160
 you want to have all of those things

24:03.160 --> 24:06.920
 that you can only get into sometimes a

24:06.920 --> 24:10.840
 desktop PC. And to do all of that in your

24:10.840 --> 24:13.080
 phone and be able to be in the

24:13.080 --> 24:15.240
 leadership position generation after

24:15.240 --> 24:16.920
 generation is an incredible thing. And

24:16.920 --> 24:18.920
 we're very proud of that at Qualcomm.

24:18.920 --> 24:22.200
 Yes, you have to do the Y5, 5G, all the...

24:22.200 --> 24:24.040
 And you have to be good at every one of

24:24.040 --> 24:26.200
 those technologies. Pack it all in

24:26.200 --> 24:28.440
 and there's also pressure to make the

24:28.440 --> 24:30.600
 thing faster and faster and faster

24:30.600 --> 24:31.640
 and then there's more and more

24:31.640 --> 24:33.160
 applications that you're supposed to be

24:33.160 --> 24:35.480
 effortlessly using. And then you

24:35.480 --> 24:37.880
 mentioned the NPU, GPU, CPU, they have to

24:37.880 --> 24:40.760
 also dance together somehow, that to

24:40.760 --> 24:42.680
 communicate well, share memory or not

24:42.680 --> 24:44.280
 depending on what the application is.

24:44.280 --> 24:48.120
 And your battery has to last all day.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.560
 So think about that, from a company like

24:49.560 --> 24:52.680
 Qualcomm, we have to be good and each and

24:52.680 --> 24:53.880
 every one of those technologies, we can

24:53.880 --> 24:56.040
 just say, oh, we're a CPU company or a GPU

24:56.040 --> 24:58.120
 company or we're AI company, we have to

24:58.120 --> 25:00.920
 do everything. What does it take to

25:00.920 --> 25:04.280
 design a great processor? So design this

25:04.280 --> 25:06.200
 system on a chip that you mentioned, is

25:06.200 --> 25:08.200
 there some insight you can provide in

25:08.200 --> 25:12.520
 this chaos of engineers, designers,

25:12.520 --> 25:16.200
 leaders, the people that think

25:16.200 --> 25:17.400
 about how much this is all going to

25:17.400 --> 25:19.640
 cause the whole mess of it?

25:19.640 --> 25:21.800
 I'm of course very partial about it. I've

25:21.800 --> 25:23.800
 been in this company for probably more

25:23.800 --> 25:27.400
 than 26 years. But I'll argue that

25:27.400 --> 25:29.080
 there are a couple things that are

25:29.080 --> 25:32.440
 ingredients for the success. So we talk

25:32.440 --> 25:33.640
 about the fact that you have all those

25:33.640 --> 25:35.400
 different technologies, they evolve at

25:35.400 --> 25:37.720
 their own pace and you have to be good

25:37.720 --> 25:39.400
 in each one of them and you needed them

25:39.400 --> 25:41.000
 to make them working together.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.240
 So you need to have an

25:43.240 --> 25:47.800
 engineering organization that's with

25:47.800 --> 25:50.440
 incredible collaboration culture

25:50.440 --> 25:52.680
 because everybody has to be working. The

25:52.680 --> 25:54.200
 train is going to leave the station,

25:54.200 --> 25:56.840
 every cart needs to be there. When it

25:56.840 --> 25:58.280
 leaves the station, it needs to leave on

25:58.280 --> 26:00.200
 time, especially in the phone business.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.680
 You can change Christmas, you cannot

26:02.680 --> 26:05.160
 change Black Friday, you cannot change

26:05.160 --> 26:07.400
 all of the selling seasons. So the phones

26:07.400 --> 26:09.160
 are going to launch on time and every

26:09.160 --> 26:10.200
 technology needs to be there. The

26:10.200 --> 26:13.000
 engineer needs to work as one and we do

26:13.000 --> 26:14.840
 have that at Qualcomm. The other thing

26:14.840 --> 26:18.280
 you have to have incredible discipline

26:18.280 --> 26:21.320
 because those are very complex

26:21.320 --> 26:24.680
 systems. So in one way you have to

26:24.680 --> 26:29.160
 design with quality because in many

26:29.160 --> 26:31.160
 cases we're going to be ramping

26:31.160 --> 26:33.640
 production and even before we have the

26:33.640 --> 26:36.840
 silicon back and you have to rely on

26:36.840 --> 26:39.000
 our simulation models and you have to

26:39.000 --> 26:41.800
 rely on the fact that

26:41.800 --> 26:44.040
 you design for commercial

26:44.040 --> 26:47.400
 applications. That takes a while

26:47.400 --> 26:50.760
 to build and it's probably been

26:50.760 --> 26:53.000
 the history of a semiconductor

26:53.000 --> 26:54.600
 business at Qualcomm. So you mean like

26:54.600 --> 26:56.520
 the framework of how many people can

26:56.520 --> 26:57.880
 use simulation software and all that

26:57.880 --> 26:59.800
 kind of stuff to build the thing

26:59.800 --> 27:01.880
 with a hard deadline that you might

27:01.880 --> 27:03.640
 not even get back from

27:03.640 --> 27:07.000
 like manufacture before. You're not

27:07.000 --> 27:08.600
 allowed to have any mistakes. No wonder

27:08.600 --> 27:11.240
 our name is quality communications. Oh

27:11.240 --> 27:12.440
 I never even thought about the

27:12.440 --> 27:15.720
 Qual part. Quality. So quality and

27:15.720 --> 27:17.640
 there's a bar that's high and you're

27:17.640 --> 27:19.560
 not allowed to mess up. I mean to me as

27:19.560 --> 27:21.160
 an engineer that's exciting. Hard

27:21.160 --> 27:26.120
 deadlines. No room for mistakes. I love

27:26.120 --> 27:29.080
 it. Super stressful but I love it. So

27:29.080 --> 27:31.080
 there's a couple of other small

27:31.080 --> 27:33.640
 companies

27:33.640 --> 27:36.680
 called Google and Apple. So Google is

27:36.680 --> 27:38.280
 now using its own chip for the Pixel

27:38.280 --> 27:41.720
 6. Apple using its own. How does

27:41.720 --> 27:45.560
 Qualcomm outcompete Google and Apple?

27:45.560 --> 27:47.400
 How does it beat them? We don't have to

27:47.400 --> 27:49.400
 outcompete Google. Actually if you look

27:49.400 --> 27:51.320
 of our mobile strategy today and then

27:51.320 --> 27:52.760
 one thing I was very clear when I

27:52.760 --> 27:54.120
 became CEO. I think there's a lot of

27:54.120 --> 27:55.480
 confusion in the market. Our mobile

27:55.480 --> 27:58.840
 strategy is very clear. We are focused

27:58.840 --> 28:02.280
 of making Snapdragon synonymous with

28:02.280 --> 28:05.160
 premium Android experience. That's what

28:05.160 --> 28:08.280
 Snapdragon is. Android. The phone of the people.

28:08.280 --> 28:11.880
 Yes. I just have a love for Android. No

28:11.880 --> 28:13.480
 I'm constantly talking trash to iPhone

28:13.480 --> 28:15.240
 people. Sorry go ahead. Premium

28:15.240 --> 28:18.360
 Android experiences. So we do

28:18.360 --> 28:20.440
 produce Snapdragon in multiple tier

28:20.440 --> 28:22.840
 for every price point but you know every

28:22.840 --> 28:26.680
 year you mentioned the HN1 and every

28:26.680 --> 28:29.080
 year we provide you know the flagship

28:29.080 --> 28:32.120
 product and then the other series

28:32.120 --> 28:34.040
 that is trying to get the best of

28:34.040 --> 28:36.680
 every possible technology at that time.

28:36.680 --> 28:39.480
 And it's really focused on enabling the

28:39.480 --> 28:42.360
 Android ecosystem. So I'll give an

28:42.360 --> 28:44.120
 example. So you asked me the question

28:44.120 --> 28:45.480
 how to compete with Google. It's not

28:45.480 --> 28:46.760
 about competing with Google. We're the

28:46.760 --> 28:49.640
 number one enabler of the Google

28:49.640 --> 28:53.960
 Android ecosystem. And the largest

28:53.960 --> 28:56.280
 largest and number one customer there

28:56.280 --> 28:58.600
 is actually Samsung. And if you look

28:58.600 --> 29:01.720
 what happened to Samsung. Samsung

29:01.720 --> 29:07.240
 I always had since I began my

29:07.240 --> 29:08.920
 began my relationship with them because

29:08.920 --> 29:10.440
 they always had their own chip. They

29:10.440 --> 29:13.560
 always had their own chip. And if you'll

29:13.560 --> 29:14.760
 just look what happened right now with

29:14.760 --> 29:17.640
 the Galaxy S22 that just launched. You

29:17.640 --> 29:19.800
 know they used to balance their

29:19.800 --> 29:21.720
 business about 50% Qualcomm. They will

29:21.720 --> 29:23.960
 get the most advanced markets like the

29:23.960 --> 29:26.440
 United States and China and Japan and

29:26.440 --> 29:28.760
 Korea they will assign a Qualcomm. And

29:28.760 --> 29:30.600
 then they'll have their own chip for the

29:30.600 --> 29:32.760
 markets that they would will be like

29:32.760 --> 29:34.520
 more emerging markets open markets

29:34.520 --> 29:35.960
 markets that they have a control on the

29:35.960 --> 29:37.480
 channel because they sell a lot of

29:37.480 --> 29:39.880
 appliances and other things. If you look

29:39.880 --> 29:45.160
 what happened right now GS22. 75% is

29:45.160 --> 29:50.520
 Qualcomm. And then the next large OEMs

29:50.520 --> 29:52.200
 and Android system are the Chinese

29:52.200 --> 29:55.160
 ones. Companies like Xiaomi. One of the

29:55.160 --> 29:57.720
 fastest growing. It was number one in

29:57.720 --> 30:00.360
 Europe at some point last year. Then

30:00.360 --> 30:03.560
 followed by OPPO and OnePlus and Vivo.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.400
 So those are some of the largest

30:05.400 --> 30:08.680
 Qualcomm customers. And they actually

30:08.680 --> 30:13.080
 drive the Android ecosystem. And that's

30:13.080 --> 30:15.560
 our mobile strategy. And fully aligned

30:15.560 --> 30:19.560
 with Google. And it's working. And I was

30:19.560 --> 30:21.320
 you know I'm not to get into a lot of

30:21.320 --> 30:24.840
 the investor conversation. But we're

30:24.840 --> 30:29.320
 also happy we became in a beneficiary

30:29.320 --> 30:31.160
 of the shifts that we saw in the

30:31.160 --> 30:34.440
 marketplace. As Huawei became a smaller

30:34.440 --> 30:37.800
 OEM as a result of the sanctions. We saw

30:37.800 --> 30:41.640
 the rise of a lot of the other OEMs from

30:41.640 --> 30:43.560
 China. Especially for China domestic

30:43.560 --> 30:46.840
 market Xiaomi OPPO Vivo. They moved to

30:46.840 --> 30:48.520
 the premium category. They're all doing

30:48.520 --> 30:51.400
 that with Qualcomm. So we're actually

30:51.400 --> 30:53.240
 very fortunate and happy with the

30:53.240 --> 30:55.800
 position we are in mobile business. We

30:55.800 --> 30:57.800
 do have an Apple relationship. We

30:57.800 --> 31:02.440
 provide modem technology to Apple. It's

31:02.440 --> 31:04.040
 a multi year relationship. Apple has

31:04.040 --> 31:06.520
 been very public that they are

31:06.520 --> 31:09.400
 investing to develop their own modem.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.960
 But the Qualcomm strategy has been

31:11.960 --> 31:14.280
 clear. We're really focused on

31:14.280 --> 31:16.760
 Snapdragon. Our mobile

31:16.760 --> 31:19.240
 strategy is not defined by providing

31:19.240 --> 31:21.080
 a cellular modem to Apple. Our mobile

31:21.080 --> 31:22.280
 strategy is this that we just talk

31:22.280 --> 31:24.360
 about it. It's about the unique thing

31:24.360 --> 31:26.440
 of Snapdragon. It has every single

31:26.440 --> 31:28.440
 technology integrated into a single

31:28.440 --> 31:31.560
 SoC. It provides a premium

31:31.560 --> 31:33.400
 experience. And that's what we're doing

31:33.400 --> 31:37.000
 and focusing on the Android ecosystem. I

31:37.000 --> 31:38.840
 don't know if I can ask you this kind

31:38.840 --> 31:40.920
 of question. It's like picking your

31:40.920 --> 31:42.920
 children or something like this. But

31:42.920 --> 31:45.640
 what smartphone the Snapdragon. You

31:45.640 --> 31:48.600
 mentioned Samsung Galaxy S22. One

31:48.600 --> 31:51.320
 plus those are phones I personally

31:51.320 --> 31:53.880
 really enjoy. What phone do you currently

31:53.880 --> 31:55.640
 use. Or do you have multiple phones. I

31:55.640 --> 31:58.280
 do have multiple phones but I do use

31:58.280 --> 32:00.920
 Galaxy S22. That's your favorite one.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.600
 All right. Well you heard it here first

32:02.600 --> 32:05.560
 folks. Okay so excellent. Can Qualcomm

32:05.560 --> 32:08.840
 also let's take a brief step away from

32:08.840 --> 32:12.280
 mobile. And take on Intel and Apple

32:12.280 --> 32:14.200
 and other such companies in the laptop

32:14.200 --> 32:16.600
 and desktop space. So the nature of what

32:16.600 --> 32:18.760
 a computer is seems to be changing. It's

32:18.760 --> 32:21.960
 like smartphones like merging. It's all

32:21.960 --> 32:23.400
 being a smartphone just with the biggest

32:23.400 --> 32:24.920
 screen or something like this. So what

32:24.920 --> 32:27.080
 is the future of that look like. Before

32:27.080 --> 32:29.400
 I answer that question. Let me just step

32:29.400 --> 32:31.320
 back a little bit. Because and I'm sure

32:31.320 --> 32:33.000
 we can we can talk more about those

32:33.000 --> 32:36.360
 things. But the the reality is Qualcomm

32:36.360 --> 32:39.320
 is changing a lot. And we use I know we

32:39.320 --> 32:40.920
 spend a lot of time talking about 5G

32:40.920 --> 32:43.000
 and smartphone and Snapdragon. And I

32:43.000 --> 32:44.920
 think that has been what had defined

32:44.920 --> 32:46.280
 Qualcomm for many years. But the

32:46.280 --> 32:49.400
 reality is even consistent with that

32:49.400 --> 32:52.280
 5G conversation. Which is a technology to

32:52.280 --> 32:55.240
 connect everything. Qualcomm is also

32:55.240 --> 32:58.200
 changing. Our technology that was in

32:58.200 --> 33:01.720
 many cases designed for phones. And we

33:01.720 --> 33:04.040
 said at the beginning. Connectivity and

33:04.040 --> 33:07.080
 processing. Is going to virtually every

33:07.080 --> 33:10.040
 industry. And as a result Qualcomm

33:10.040 --> 33:12.840
 is really changing with it. And expending

33:12.840 --> 33:14.440
 to a number of different addressable

33:14.440 --> 33:19.000
 markets. Some of those markets is the

33:19.000 --> 33:21.960
 PC. As you talk about it. The the

33:21.960 --> 33:25.480
 conversions of mobile and PC. And the

33:25.480 --> 33:27.240
 reason I'm excited about this. Because

33:27.240 --> 33:29.400
 you see a lot of things happening that

33:29.400 --> 33:31.720
 bring this right front and center when

33:31.720 --> 33:33.400
 you think about the future technology.

33:33.400 --> 33:37.720
 So what we learn with the pandemic. Is

33:37.720 --> 33:40.360
 that the number one use case of

33:40.360 --> 33:44.920
 personal computers. Is communications.

33:44.920 --> 33:46.200
 It is interesting when you think about

33:46.200 --> 33:48.440
 that. That's the number one use case on

33:48.440 --> 33:50.760
 a PC today is communications. It's

33:50.760 --> 33:53.000
 actually funny because in the cellular

33:53.000 --> 33:54.680
 industry. Actually I'll say let me step

33:54.680 --> 33:58.200
 back. In the telecom industry. We've been

33:58.200 --> 34:00.920
 chasing this killer application of

34:00.920 --> 34:03.720
 video telephony for decades right. I

34:03.720 --> 34:07.960
 remember. Back then in the wire line.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.320
 Even before the internet and IP ISDN.

34:11.320 --> 34:14.520
 You remember those AT&T desk phones of

34:14.520 --> 34:16.200
 a little screen. And I said you can do

34:16.200 --> 34:19.640
 video telephony. We don't watch that. In

34:19.640 --> 34:21.720
 back to the future too. Then when we

34:21.720 --> 34:23.800
 started developing 3G said people said

34:23.800 --> 34:25.560
 what's the application for having data

34:25.560 --> 34:27.800
 to itself. All video telephony. Then we

34:27.800 --> 34:31.480
 started doing 4G. And in the beginning

34:31.480 --> 34:33.000
 people said well why do you need all

34:33.000 --> 34:35.640
 this broadband. All video telephony. But

34:35.640 --> 34:37.960
 it took a pandemic. To make video

34:37.960 --> 34:40.600
 telephony. The killer application. And

34:40.600 --> 34:44.120
 that's now the number one use case on a

34:44.120 --> 34:45.960
 PC. So now think about that for a

34:45.960 --> 34:48.600
 second. Personal computers now. There

34:48.600 --> 34:49.880
 are technologies that people when they

34:49.880 --> 34:51.240
 are going to buy a PC. They didn't care

34:51.240 --> 34:53.800
 much about it. Now they do. Camera.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.920
 Camera. How good is the camera. The audio.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.200
 Is that connected. How good is the

34:58.200 --> 34:59.640
 connectivity. Do you have the latest and

34:59.640 --> 35:02.200
 greatest Wi Fi in cellular. What's the

35:02.200 --> 35:03.960
 battery life. Because you're going to be

35:03.960 --> 35:05.320
 working from anywhere. Sometimes you

35:05.320 --> 35:07.480
 need to ask. Sometimes you're not. So all

35:07.480 --> 35:09.400
 those things. What's the portability

35:09.400 --> 35:11.800
 like. So those things started to change

35:11.800 --> 35:14.040
 how we should think about the PC. But I

35:14.040 --> 35:15.800
 won't stop there. Let me talk about

35:15.800 --> 35:19.480
 another trend. So in it. And all come as

35:19.480 --> 35:21.720
 a result of what we saw the pandemic.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.640
 Let's say that you are. You're an

35:23.640 --> 35:24.920
 engineer. You're the computer aided

35:24.920 --> 35:29.640
 design. You have advanced desktop

35:29.640 --> 35:33.000
 computer or workstation in your office.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.160
 But you want to work from home someday. So

35:35.160 --> 35:36.360
 you're not going to move that to your

35:36.360 --> 35:38.120
 home. So what do you need to do. You're

35:38.120 --> 35:40.280
 going to have to rely on that. You're

35:40.280 --> 35:41.960
 going to run that on the cloud. And you

35:41.960 --> 35:43.640
 can run another cloud. You need high

35:43.640 --> 35:45.800
 bandwidth. Because you almost want the

35:45.800 --> 35:49.160
 cloud. To be. The same as your computer

35:49.160 --> 35:51.640
 for that use case. That's the 5g on

35:51.640 --> 35:54.360
 demand computing use case. The use 5g

35:54.360 --> 35:57.160
 is almost a link between two computers.

35:57.160 --> 35:59.720
 But then. You know CIOs are saying well

35:59.720 --> 36:01.880
 my workforce is going home for some

36:01.880 --> 36:03.800
 days. I want all the data to be in the

36:03.800 --> 36:06.200
 cloud. You look at for example Microsoft

36:06.200 --> 36:08.600
 OneDrive. Or the ability to collaborate.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.880
 You need the bandwidth. So that when you

36:11.880 --> 36:13.960
 put all of those things together. You

36:13.960 --> 36:15.480
 start thinking about what is the next

36:15.480 --> 36:17.880
 generation PC. And that's the

36:17.880 --> 36:19.560
 opportunity for Qualcomm. I'm just giving

36:19.560 --> 36:23.480
 an example. Back in Mobile World

36:23.480 --> 36:27.560
 Congress. Recently Lenovo. They have a

36:27.560 --> 36:31.880
 line of enterprise laptops called the

36:31.880 --> 36:33.320
 ThinkPad. I'm sure you're familiar with

36:33.320 --> 36:35.960
 it. So they announced the ThinkPad

36:35.960 --> 36:40.760
 based on Snapdragon. With 5g on. 28

36:40.760 --> 36:44.920
 hours of battery life. So that's

36:44.920 --> 36:46.680
 next generation. It's just a nice screen

36:46.680 --> 36:49.160
 with extremely high. Nice screen and

36:49.160 --> 36:52.200
 keyboard. And extremely high connectivity

36:52.200 --> 36:54.120
 to maybe an even more like a more

36:54.120 --> 36:55.880
 powerful machine in the cloud. Something

36:55.880 --> 36:57.800
 more the data connecting to the data

36:57.800 --> 36:59.240
 connecting to compute all that kind of

36:59.240 --> 37:00.360
 stuff. You have the camera

37:00.360 --> 37:03.240
 capabilities. Let me go one step more.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.160
 Microsoft talking about some of the

37:05.160 --> 37:08.120
 features they're doing now. Using on

37:08.120 --> 37:11.240
 Windows 11. Using Snapdragon. Remember

37:11.240 --> 37:14.280
 we talk about a Snapdragon has an AI

37:14.280 --> 37:16.440
 processor inside there. So one of the

37:16.440 --> 37:18.200
 cool features Microsoft's talking about

37:18.200 --> 37:21.320
 it is. You can be on a team's call. And

37:21.320 --> 37:22.920
 you can make sure your eyes are looking

37:22.920 --> 37:25.560
 at the camera. 100% of the time.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.400
 Well that's an interesting so they can

37:27.400 --> 37:28.440
 be talking about that. And you do that

37:28.440 --> 37:31.560
 with AI. Yes. That's really tricky to

37:31.560 --> 37:33.320
 pull off. For example the reason I'm a

37:33.320 --> 37:35.080
 huge stickler for doing these in person.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.760
 These conversations in person. It's

37:36.760 --> 37:38.680
 really tough to get right. But it's a

37:38.680 --> 37:40.360
 worthy challenge. So that's where the

37:40.360 --> 37:42.760
 metaverse hopes to. So like I just

37:42.760 --> 37:44.040
 because you said the importance of this

37:44.040 --> 37:46.200
 telephony. Of humans connecting

37:46.200 --> 37:48.440
 teleporting themselves. Getting that

37:48.440 --> 37:50.280
 right is really difficult. There's a lot

37:50.280 --> 37:52.760
 of people hate Zoom meetings. But that

37:52.760 --> 37:54.760
 doesn't mean you can't improve that

37:54.760 --> 37:57.160
 experience. And get rid of the hate. A

37:57.160 --> 37:58.760
 lot of people hate talking to the car

37:58.760 --> 38:01.240
 too. Because the voice. The natural

38:01.240 --> 38:03.320
 language processing is terrible. But when

38:03.320 --> 38:05.000
 it's not. It's a beautiful thing. So

38:05.000 --> 38:06.680
 getting that right is. This is an

38:06.680 --> 38:08.280
 opportunity. This is an opportunity.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.440
 Think about it. It starts with the PC

38:10.440 --> 38:13.160
 making. The PC giving you a better

38:13.160 --> 38:15.560
 experience for teams. But then. It goes

38:15.560 --> 38:18.280
 right back into. This trend of

38:18.280 --> 38:20.440
 connecting physical and digital spaces.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.520
 And all the work we're doing. With the

38:22.520 --> 38:23.960
 metaverse and virtual reality and

38:23.960 --> 38:26.120
 the meta reality and the future is. Why

38:26.120 --> 38:28.120
 not. Call somebody or connect with

38:28.120 --> 38:30.280
 somebody with a hologram. It's possible.

38:30.280 --> 38:33.480
 And also to mention. Some. Increasing

38:33.480 --> 38:36.280
 amount of intelligence in our cars. So

38:36.280 --> 38:38.200
 semi autonomous autonomous cars and the

38:38.200 --> 38:41.640
 interactivity between human and. And car.

38:41.640 --> 38:44.440
 Which for me things are. Really

38:44.440 --> 38:45.960
 exciting. Let me ask you a big question.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.880
 So when when aliens again now on the

38:47.880 --> 38:50.440
 other side. Right. And humans destroy

38:50.440 --> 38:52.040
 themselves through nuclear war centuries

38:52.040 --> 38:53.800
 from now. Let's hope not. Let's hope

38:53.800 --> 38:55.400
 not. But in case you know let's just

38:55.400 --> 38:57.000
 hypothetical thought experiment. And

38:57.000 --> 38:59.160
 they write a history of humanity in the

38:59.160 --> 39:02.360
 twenty first century. What would they

39:02.360 --> 39:05.080
 remember Qualcomm. In the twenty first

39:05.080 --> 39:06.760
 century as a company would be a car

39:06.760 --> 39:09.000
 company. Would it like think of all the

39:09.000 --> 39:11.240
 crazy pivots that might happen the next

39:11.240 --> 39:13.400
 like. Fifty years. Because because you're

39:13.400 --> 39:15.960
 thinking you said. Qualcomm enables all

39:15.960 --> 39:17.800
 of these things with 5G and they'll be

39:17.800 --> 39:20.760
 probably. Other G's. It keeps increasing.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.280
 So basically connectivity and

39:22.280 --> 39:24.600
 computation. And everything becomes

39:24.600 --> 39:26.360
 connected and everything is capable of

39:26.360 --> 39:28.840
 computation. Might you be become a

39:28.840 --> 39:32.760
 robotics and car company. I will argue

39:32.760 --> 39:36.040
 we already an automotive company today

39:36.040 --> 39:38.760
 and but. Let me tell what I. Would I

39:38.760 --> 39:40.840
 like Qualcomm to be. Remember and

39:40.840 --> 39:44.520
 recognize for. I think everyone. The

39:44.520 --> 39:47.400
 knows Qualcomm. Immediately. You know

39:47.400 --> 39:51.240
 connect us pun intended. To connectivity

39:51.240 --> 39:53.720
 and wireless. But the reality is. We're

39:53.720 --> 39:55.320
 been actually the company providing

39:55.320 --> 39:58.120
 intelligence. And in processing. To

39:58.120 --> 39:59.880
 everything on the edge. Everything

39:59.880 --> 40:02.360
 outside the data center. That's we're

40:02.360 --> 40:04.200
 doing. Those billions of devices are

40:04.200 --> 40:06.920
 going to be connected. And and that's

40:06.920 --> 40:08.760
 kind of explain when we talk about the

40:08.760 --> 40:11.000
 connected intelligent edge. To be on

40:11.000 --> 40:14.120
 phones. Cars. B. C. and all of those. And

40:14.120 --> 40:15.960
 the broader I. O. T. as we talk about

40:15.960 --> 40:18.120
 everything will be connected intelligent.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.480
 And that's what we want Qualcomm to be

40:19.480 --> 40:22.120
 recognized for. So by the way for people

40:22.120 --> 40:23.800
 who are not familiar. There's some

40:23.800 --> 40:25.800
 technical jargon. But people use the

40:25.800 --> 40:29.320
 word edge. Like edge computing. It's up

40:29.320 --> 40:30.600
 by the way that's probably changing

40:30.600 --> 40:32.520
 what that even means. It's basically

40:32.520 --> 40:33.880
 everything that's not a giant thing

40:33.880 --> 40:35.080
 that's make a lot of noise in a

40:35.080 --> 40:37.080
 building somewhere. So it's mobile

40:37.080 --> 40:40.120
 devices. And the mobile devices of all

40:40.120 --> 40:41.880
 kinds of well. A refrigerator is not

40:41.880 --> 40:44.120
 mobile. But it would be edge. So it's

40:44.120 --> 40:45.880
 like what's a sandwich. That kind of

40:45.880 --> 40:49.480
 discussion. But basically edge

40:49.480 --> 40:53.400
 computing. Is is. The edge of that

40:53.400 --> 40:56.280
 expanding space you mentioned. That

40:56.280 --> 40:59.320
 Qualcomm is trying to. Connect. And

40:59.320 --> 41:01.080
 enable with computation. Here's a simple

41:01.080 --> 41:03.960
 way to describe. What the edge. Is an

41:03.960 --> 41:06.440
 edge computing is. I think as we think

41:06.440 --> 41:08.200
 about the evolution of the data center.

41:09.480 --> 41:11.720
 You need to bring the computational

41:11.720 --> 41:14.920
 closer to the devices. Also when you

41:14.920 --> 41:17.160
 put the computation together with the

41:17.160 --> 41:19.720
 connectivity. At the same time. You're

41:19.720 --> 41:22.040
 going to see a lot of advancement of

41:22.040 --> 41:24.200
 artificial intelligence. Happening

41:24.200 --> 41:27.240
 closer. Or at the device. Look it's a

41:27.240 --> 41:29.320
 very. I have a simple way to describe.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.240
 Remember. In the beginning of this

41:31.240 --> 41:33.720
 conversation we talk about. In the 4G

41:33.720 --> 41:37.080
 era. Broadband. And mobile computing

41:37.080 --> 41:39.240
 evolve side by side. If you're going to

41:39.240 --> 41:40.440
 have broadband you might as well have a

41:40.440 --> 41:41.960
 computer in the palm of your hand. So

41:41.960 --> 41:43.480
 we needed to invest in those two

41:43.480 --> 41:49.240
 technologies. In 5G AI develops side by

41:49.240 --> 41:51.240
 side. You're connected to the cloud 100

41:51.240 --> 41:52.920
 percent of the time. You have a high

41:52.920 --> 41:55.000
 bandwidth. And you have now a smart and

41:55.000 --> 41:56.760
 intelligent thing that can make decision

41:56.760 --> 42:00.040
 in real time. Provide context information

42:00.040 --> 42:01.960
 to the cloud to make the models more

42:01.960 --> 42:03.880
 accurate. And as well compare and

42:03.880 --> 42:06.200
 contrast to the cloud. So there's going

42:06.200 --> 42:08.600
 to be an exponential development AI

42:08.600 --> 42:11.880
 happening. With. All the edge devices. The

42:11.880 --> 42:14.200
 devices they're outside the data center.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.440
 And computation is going to go alongside

42:16.440 --> 42:19.560
 that. And a great example that's the car.

42:19.560 --> 42:22.280
 The car. You know. We haven't talked much

42:22.280 --> 42:23.880
 about the car. But you know Qualcomm is

42:23.880 --> 42:26.760
 now. You could argue was as much as an

42:26.760 --> 42:28.280
 automotive company as a wireless

42:28.280 --> 42:32.520
 company working 26 global brands. And

42:32.520 --> 42:35.240
 it's easy to see. If you look at our

42:35.240 --> 42:37.720
 mobile heritage. And we talk about

42:37.720 --> 42:40.760
 form factors. Thermal. Battery life.

42:40.760 --> 42:42.120
 You're not going to put a server in a

42:42.120 --> 42:44.600
 trunk of a car. But you need as much

42:44.600 --> 42:47.320
 computational capabilities. And as we

42:47.320 --> 42:49.960
 see Qualcomm. Providing. You know as the

42:49.960 --> 42:53.000
 car become a connected computer on wheels.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.400
 We provide the computational. And all

42:55.400 --> 42:57.080
 the sensors for you to do assisted

42:57.080 --> 42:59.160
 driving. For the new digital cockpit

42:59.160 --> 43:00.600
 experience. Connecting the car to the

43:00.600 --> 43:03.080
 cloud. And it's all of that's happening

43:03.080 --> 43:05.240
 at the end. This Qualcomm want to be the

43:05.240 --> 43:07.160
 brain. Of a lot of autonomous vehicles

43:07.160 --> 43:08.920
 in the future of different. You said

43:08.920 --> 43:11.080
 brands. Like Mercedes BMT. I don't know

43:11.080 --> 43:13.320
 whatever. Just whatever car. You know.

43:13.320 --> 43:15.720
 Cars have the sexy thing they do. And

43:15.720 --> 43:17.720
 then it defines their brand. And so on.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.880
 And then there's the brain. That

43:19.880 --> 43:21.880
 doesn't need to have branding suppose.

43:21.880 --> 43:23.880
 You know. So does Qualcomm see that. Or

43:23.880 --> 43:26.360
 will I be able to buy a Qualcomm car.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.040
 Like literally. No. You're not going to

43:28.040 --> 43:30.200
 be able to buy a Qualcomm car. But we

43:30.200 --> 43:33.960
 are ready. We're ready. On our way. To

43:33.960 --> 43:35.800
 become. You know the brains of the car.

43:35.800 --> 43:37.480
 The way you should think about Qualcomm

43:37.480 --> 43:39.800
 automotive strategy is. The car

43:39.800 --> 43:42.920
 companies. Realize. They need to become

43:42.920 --> 43:44.840
 technology companies. You just look for

43:44.840 --> 43:47.480
 example. Of the market cap. Of some of

43:47.480 --> 43:51.080
 the new. Electrical. Commerce. And

43:51.080 --> 43:55.000
 compare them with. With the legacy. Car

43:55.000 --> 43:57.400
 companies. Which one is that I heard of.

43:57.400 --> 43:59.240
 Well let's just use an example. One of

43:59.240 --> 44:01.480
 them lives in Austin. Let's say Rivian.

44:01.480 --> 44:03.880
 Right. Rivian. Oh that one too. Yes. You

44:03.880 --> 44:05.320
 know the car companies are not going

44:05.320 --> 44:07.800
 away. It's actually a mistake not to bet

44:07.800 --> 44:10.360
 in the car companies. The car companies

44:10.360 --> 44:13.000
 need a technology partner. That will

44:13.000 --> 44:16.600
 provide. The digital chassis. For them.

44:16.600 --> 44:18.360
 And that's what we're doing. So if you

44:18.360 --> 44:19.960
 look at Qualcomm we talk about a

44:19.960 --> 44:24.360
 Snapdragon digital chassis. So. We. Want

44:24.360 --> 44:27.640
 to be the preferred technology partner.

44:27.640 --> 44:30.200
 Off. The car companies and I think it's

44:30.200 --> 44:31.880
 working. Strategy is working right now.

44:31.880 --> 44:34.200
 So basically. Helping company. The car

44:34.200 --> 44:36.200
 companies accelerate into this. Into

44:36.200 --> 44:38.040
 becoming technology companies. Connecting

44:38.040 --> 44:40.040
 the car to the cloud. We design the

44:40.040 --> 44:41.960
 interior of the digital cockpit

44:41.960 --> 44:44.200
 experience. And provide the computation

44:44.200 --> 44:46.200
 and sensor capabilities for autonomy

44:46.200 --> 44:48.840
 and assisted driving. On the topic of

44:48.840 --> 44:50.760
 robots. When millions or billions of

44:50.760 --> 44:52.600
 robots roam the earth in the future.

44:52.600 --> 44:56.920
 Among us humans. And I am. For one.

44:56.920 --> 44:59.720
 Concerned. In a small percentage. But

44:59.720 --> 45:02.120
 largely I'm excited about that future.

45:02.120 --> 45:07.160
 Will Qualcomm. Be. The thing that powers

45:07.160 --> 45:10.360
 their brain. We have an in our IOT

45:10.360 --> 45:11.800
 business. Which has been one of the

45:11.800 --> 45:15.000
 fastest growing business for us. A

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
 number of robotics engagement. So I'll

45:17.000 --> 45:20.680
 give you some example. In. If you look

45:20.680 --> 45:23.800
 of the Amazon Astro. You familiar with

45:23.800 --> 45:26.680
 that. There's two. There's two

45:26.680 --> 45:29.480
 Snapdragon in there. There is. This is

45:29.480 --> 45:30.680
 really exciting. They're supposed to

45:30.680 --> 45:32.920
 ship it to me. Where is it. Okay. But

45:32.920 --> 45:34.040
 anyway. That's really cool. I didn't know

45:34.040 --> 45:36.040
 it was Snapdragon. Yeah. We we're

45:36.040 --> 45:38.760
 working with robotics in industrial.

45:38.760 --> 45:41.400
 Of course. Drones. You know. We're

45:41.400 --> 45:44.200
 getting. More and more traction for

45:44.200 --> 45:45.800
 robotics. Sorry to interrupt. Industrial

45:45.800 --> 45:48.760
 robotics too. You said industrial.

45:48.760 --> 45:52.200
 Especially when you think about. What's

45:52.200 --> 45:55.000
 going to happen. With. The factory of

45:55.000 --> 45:56.600
 the future. The industrial side of the

45:56.600 --> 45:58.040
 future. The warehouse of the future.

45:58.040 --> 46:00.920
 When you bring. Five G. For example to

46:00.920 --> 46:03.560
 it. And you have. A number of different

46:03.560 --> 46:07.240
 use cases and. In. And then you see a

46:07.240 --> 46:09.880
 lot of robotics application. And. And of

46:09.880 --> 46:14.440
 course. Drones. And. The most famous. I

46:14.440 --> 46:16.840
 will consider that a robot. The most

46:16.840 --> 46:19.880
 famous. Robot. In the world right now.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.560
 It's powered by Snapdragon. Which is

46:21.560 --> 46:24.360
 the Mars. Ingenuity helicopter. Yeah.

46:24.360 --> 46:26.520
 The whole helicopter. The cameras and

46:26.520 --> 46:28.680
 everything. It's powered by Snapdragon.

46:28.680 --> 46:31.400
 And. Talking about. Exciting thing for

46:31.400 --> 46:34.040
 an engineer. The same Snapdragon that

46:34.040 --> 46:35.880
 goes to a phone. And it can go to a

46:35.880 --> 46:37.800
 galaxy phone. For example Samsung. The

46:37.800 --> 46:40.520
 same. Not a special one. Went all the way

46:40.520 --> 46:43.800
 to Mars. Is exploring other planets

46:43.800 --> 46:45.480
 looking for alien life. And maybe gets

46:45.480 --> 46:46.520
 to meet him. Wouldn't that be

46:46.520 --> 46:48.120
 interesting. If a snapdragon is the

46:48.120 --> 46:49.880
 thing that first sees an alien. Is like

46:49.880 --> 46:51.560
 what the hell. We did not program this

46:51.560 --> 46:53.000
 in the computer vision. I once used

46:53.000 --> 46:54.280
 example to go back to the

46:54.280 --> 46:57.240
 conversation we had about quality. As

46:57.240 --> 46:59.160
 an engineer. You need to make sure it

46:59.160 --> 47:00.680
 works. Can you imagine if it gets over

47:00.680 --> 47:02.120
 there in Mars and it doesn't work. Listen

47:02.120 --> 47:05.080
 this is very stressful. What NASA

47:05.080 --> 47:06.600
 with SpaceX with all those companies

47:06.600 --> 47:08.120
 are doing is extremely stressful. The

47:08.120 --> 47:10.760
 room for mistakes is. Is tiny. But

47:10.760 --> 47:12.520
 that's super exciting for an engineer

47:12.520 --> 47:15.800
 once again. There's been a global

47:15.800 --> 47:17.640
 semiconductor chip shortage. So from

47:17.640 --> 47:19.240
 your perspective. Just to be

47:19.240 --> 47:21.320
 interesting to get your expert

47:21.320 --> 47:23.480
 analysis of the situation. What do you

47:23.480 --> 47:25.560
 think are the main reasons. And how is

47:25.560 --> 47:28.600
 quality affected. How can it help. In

47:28.600 --> 47:31.240
 this. In the future. Things like it.

47:31.240 --> 47:35.880
 Okay that's a. That's a. A big topic of

47:35.880 --> 47:37.480
 conversation. And we only have five

47:37.480 --> 47:39.880
 minutes. So I'll try. I'll try to be as

47:39.880 --> 47:42.440
 objective as I can. So first let's

47:42.440 --> 47:44.760
 talk about what caused it. And I. You

47:44.760 --> 47:46.280
 know you hear a lot of different things.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.720
 I would try to put it within the right

47:47.720 --> 47:50.200
 context. The first thing that caused it

47:50.200 --> 47:53.800
 really. Is the acceleration of digital

47:53.800 --> 47:57.080
 transformation. Of pretty much. Everything

47:57.080 --> 47:59.880
 in every industry. Every industry has

47:59.880 --> 48:03.000
 been digitally transformed. And as such.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.080
 The amount of semiconductors that are

48:05.080 --> 48:07.720
 required is much larger. Just to give

48:07.720 --> 48:09.240
 you a practical example. If you think

48:09.240 --> 48:11.880
 about the automotive as an example. The

48:11.880 --> 48:14.360
 cars there are you. There's cars there

48:14.360 --> 48:17.000
 are launch a new model launching today.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.160
 The new model launching today most

48:19.160 --> 48:21.960
 likely has ten x the amount of chips.

48:21.960 --> 48:24.680
 Off the prior model. And the model is

48:24.680 --> 48:26.520
 people working on this coming in next

48:26.520 --> 48:29.160
 probably ten x that one. So you see the

48:29.160 --> 48:30.920
 amount of silicon and in billions of

48:30.920 --> 48:33.400
 things become smart. More and more data

48:33.400 --> 48:35.720
 goes to the cloud. The data center grows.

48:35.720 --> 48:38.040
 So the floor for semiconductor

48:38.040 --> 48:40.600
 consumptions went up by a lot. Then you

48:40.600 --> 48:43.240
 have things that aggravated this. The

48:43.240 --> 48:45.320
 pandemic aggravated this. There is a

48:45.320 --> 48:47.880
 couple trends. From the pandemic. The

48:47.880 --> 48:50.120
 enterprise transformation of the home. The

48:50.120 --> 48:52.200
 home became an enterprise massive

48:52.200 --> 48:57.400
 amount of upgrades on broadband and iot.

48:57.400 --> 49:01.160
 The office. Has changed to the way we

49:01.160 --> 49:03.720
 work now. In including the ability to

49:03.720 --> 49:06.760
 support collaboration tools and video.

49:06.760 --> 49:12.760
 Then you have. The. Higher demand. For

49:12.760 --> 49:16.120
 for products. Doing the pandemic. Because

49:16.120 --> 49:17.800
 people wanted to be connected. People

49:17.800 --> 49:19.320
 bought new phones and new tablets and

49:19.320 --> 49:22.760
 new computers. New gaming. So all of

49:22.760 --> 49:25.640
 those things came on top of that. As.

49:25.640 --> 49:27.400
 That aggravated the issue. But they're

49:27.400 --> 49:30.040
 not the main issue. The main issue is.

49:30.040 --> 49:34.360
 It's actually. A long term growth. Of

49:34.360 --> 49:37.400
 digital. So what i'm hearing you say. Is.

49:37.400 --> 49:39.640
 The pandemic was not the cause. It was

49:39.640 --> 49:42.680
 an aggravation. Is an aggravation. So. Is

49:42.680 --> 49:47.400
 there a way. We can support. As a human

49:47.400 --> 49:49.880
 civilization. In terms of manufacture. In

49:49.880 --> 49:52.680
 terms of supply. The kind of growth that

49:52.680 --> 49:55.320
 you're talking about. In devices and so

49:55.320 --> 49:57.720
 on. Is there. High level ideas you can

49:57.720 --> 50:00.360
 save. What that's required there. Yes and

50:00.360 --> 50:02.040
 i think that's. The second part of the

50:02.040 --> 50:03.880
 answer. So what's happening now. How are

50:03.880 --> 50:07.080
 we gonna get out of this. So. We see a

50:07.080 --> 50:10.440
 lot. Of capacity investments put into

50:10.440 --> 50:13.240
 place by the industry. You know we had

50:13.240 --> 50:15.880
 invested a lot of our suppliers. A lot

50:15.880 --> 50:20.120
 of the suppliers. Had made. Plans about.

50:20.120 --> 50:22.600
 You know. Increasing the capacity industry

50:22.600 --> 50:24.680
 explaining to double. It's total

50:24.680 --> 50:27.080
 semiconductor manufacturing capacity.

50:27.080 --> 50:30.120
 Within the next. Five years an example. So

50:30.120 --> 50:31.800
 that's already happening. And then you

50:31.800 --> 50:33.800
 see things which are actually good.

50:33.800 --> 50:36.360
 They're good. The initiative such as the

50:36.360 --> 50:38.760
 United States chips act. And now the

50:38.760 --> 50:41.400
 European chips act. The United States

50:41.400 --> 50:43.240
 chips acts about fifty two billion

50:43.240 --> 50:45.800
 dollars. The Europeans about forty three.

50:45.800 --> 50:48.920
 Their goal combined. Is to get at least

50:48.920 --> 50:52.840
 fifty percent of the consumption. With

50:52.840 --> 50:55.320
 manufacturing stalled within the US.

50:55.320 --> 50:57.480
 And European geographies. And that's

50:57.480 --> 51:00.280
 also very good. That's yet another.

51:00.280 --> 51:03.080
 Incentive for more manufacturing capacity

51:03.080 --> 51:05.720
 be built. And to be built. With a

51:05.720 --> 51:08.600
 geographic distributed way. Which that's

51:08.600 --> 51:10.680
 how you plan supply chains. So those.

51:10.680 --> 51:12.520
 Those I think are good things. So if

51:12.520 --> 51:15.960
 anything we learn. Through the crisis. Is

51:15.960 --> 51:19.400
 this a my conductor. Is important. My

51:19.400 --> 51:21.320
 conductor companies are important. And

51:21.320 --> 51:23.720
 we need to invest in semiconductors.

51:23.720 --> 51:26.200
 Returning to the grilling of the CEO. The

51:26.200 --> 51:29.240
 hard questions. This is almost for my own

51:29.240 --> 51:30.840
 education of the space. You mentioned

51:30.840 --> 51:33.160
 regulators. Qualcomm paid out and

51:33.160 --> 51:35.320
 received payment of billions of dollars

51:35.320 --> 51:38.360
 and settlement and fines. There seems to

51:38.360 --> 51:40.440
 be a lot of huge lawsuits in the space.

51:40.440 --> 51:43.480
 How do you explain that. Does. Does this

51:43.480 --> 51:45.480
 get in the way of innovation. Or does it

51:45.480 --> 51:47.960
 promote it. I will rephrase it by saying

51:47.960 --> 51:51.080
 they used to be. A lot. Of lawsuits in

51:51.080 --> 51:55.640
 this space. In addition. Of. Of what we do

51:55.640 --> 51:58.200
 in semiconductors. You know our processors

51:58.200 --> 52:00.200
 and our our modems. The Snapdragon

52:00.200 --> 52:03.960
 platform. We also have a licensing

52:03.960 --> 52:06.280
 business. Which has been a part of the

52:06.280 --> 52:08.680
 company since the beginning. As the

52:08.680 --> 52:13.080
 largest. Inventors. Of the essential

52:13.080 --> 52:17.080
 technology. In. Two G. CDMA. Three G. Four

52:17.080 --> 52:20.120
 G. And five G. You know and Qualcomm

52:20.120 --> 52:22.120
 contribute that to the standards. So we

52:22.120 --> 52:25.320
 always had this model that. Rather than

52:25.320 --> 52:26.760
 invent the technology and be the only

52:26.760 --> 52:28.600
 one producing the products we license

52:28.600 --> 52:32.200
 so everyone can produce it. And. And as

52:32.200 --> 52:35.960
 such we receive intellectual property.

52:35.960 --> 52:41.160
 For the standard essential patents. As

52:41.160 --> 52:44.360
 part of our past dispute with Apple.

52:44.360 --> 52:47.240
 That's behind us now. Your friends now.

52:47.240 --> 52:50.120
 They're. They're. They're my customers.

52:50.120 --> 52:53.400
 And. And as part of that I think the. The

52:53.400 --> 52:56.520
 licensing model. Yes. Got tested. In. I

52:56.520 --> 52:59.800
 think in every geography. And we

52:59.800 --> 53:02.280
 succeeded. In every single geography. To

53:02.280 --> 53:05.160
 validate. The. Pro competitive. The

53:05.160 --> 53:08.280
 next of this model. I think the. The

53:08.280 --> 53:10.680
 fair reasonable non discriminatory

53:10.680 --> 53:13.480
 aspect of this model. And I would argue

53:13.480 --> 53:16.360
 that. Besides being the most successful

53:16.360 --> 53:18.760
 licensing business to date. And the

53:18.760 --> 53:21.080
 industry. Probably the one that's been

53:21.080 --> 53:23.240
 battle tested. And this most stable.

53:23.240 --> 53:25.720
 Because there's not a single. Jurisdiction

53:25.720 --> 53:28.600
 that we have not. Had to validate that

53:28.600 --> 53:31.400
 model. So. It's part of our past. And what

53:31.400 --> 53:33.160
 he creates is probably create a lot of

53:33.160 --> 53:35.320
 stability. No licensing business. But

53:35.320 --> 53:37.640
 having said that. The growth of the

53:37.640 --> 53:40.120
 company is in the semiconductor space.

53:40.120 --> 53:43.160
 And the semiconductor. So licensing is

53:43.160 --> 53:44.840
 you come up with a pretty good idea. You

53:44.840 --> 53:46.520
 have a bunch of smart people coming up

53:46.520 --> 53:49.000
 with cool ideas. And then once you come

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
 up with that idea. You sell that idea to

53:51.000 --> 53:52.520
 others. They get to use it. That's

53:52.520 --> 53:54.600
 essentially what a license. The license

53:54.600 --> 53:58.280
 revenue we have. Is. Is for the. What we

53:58.280 --> 54:02.120
 call the SCP. Standard essential patents.

54:02.120 --> 54:06.200
 That are part of. The. Two G. Three G. Four

54:06.200 --> 54:08.120
 G. And five G. Standards. So if you want

54:08.120 --> 54:11.400
 to build anything with five G. You need

54:11.400 --> 54:13.400
 it to. Get a license from Qualcomm.

54:13.400 --> 54:16.120
 Because uses Qualcomm. Essential

54:16.120 --> 54:18.040
 technology is part of the standard. And

54:18.040 --> 54:20.040
 a slightly different model. Or a lot

54:20.040 --> 54:22.120
 different model. The semiconductor. Is

54:22.120 --> 54:24.840
 you design. You inject a bunch of

54:24.840 --> 54:26.200
 fascinating ideas. How to build the

54:26.200 --> 54:28.680
 snapdragon. And then there's. Because it's

54:28.680 --> 54:30.360
 a fabulous company. You have somebody

54:30.360 --> 54:33.720
 build. The. This. The. The chip. And it

54:33.720 --> 54:35.400
 goes into a phone with the branding and

54:35.400 --> 54:37.720
 all that kind of stuff. And. And that

54:37.720 --> 54:40.120
 has less kind of. Players involved. It's

54:40.120 --> 54:42.520
 not a license. We sell the product. In

54:42.520 --> 54:44.040
 the semiconductor. We don't license

54:44.040 --> 54:45.800
 semiconductor technology. We build

54:45.800 --> 54:49.640
 products. And we sell products. This is

54:49.640 --> 54:52.360
 your first year as a CEO. No. Not one

54:52.360 --> 54:56.200
 year yet. Not one year yet. Yeah. Let's

54:56.200 --> 54:58.200
 hope it'll be in June. It'll be one year.

54:58.200 --> 55:02.280
 Okay. This is a. A company that's

55:02.280 --> 55:05.320
 involved. With a lot of fascinating

55:05.320 --> 55:07.320
 technologies. And it's touching the lives

55:07.320 --> 55:09.800
 of billions of people. A lot of

55:09.800 --> 55:12.120
 complicated stuff. Like I said, licensing

55:12.120 --> 55:15.640
 technologies. You have to collaborate

55:15.640 --> 55:18.520
 with manufacturers. You have to then work

55:18.520 --> 55:20.840
 with however many you said car companies

55:20.840 --> 55:23.560
 and all these clients and so on. And you

55:23.560 --> 55:25.880
 have to. You know with with tech

55:25.880 --> 55:30.040
 companies. Apple and so on. What's that

55:30.040 --> 55:31.640
 like? What lessons have you learned

55:31.640 --> 55:33.640
 about leadership? And maybe about

55:33.640 --> 55:35.400
 yourself as a human being from this

55:35.400 --> 55:39.320
 first. Almost a year. Soon to be a year

55:39.320 --> 55:41.480
 as a CEO of this incredible, this

55:41.480 --> 55:43.720
 complex, this large company. That's a

55:43.720 --> 55:45.720
 little bit of a question. Let me answer

55:45.720 --> 55:48.520
 in reverse order. First thing that I

55:48.520 --> 55:50.600
 learned. And I think it's probably

55:50.600 --> 55:54.840
 common. Across CEOs. Especially in our

55:54.840 --> 55:57.480
 industry. Yes. It will be great if I had

55:57.480 --> 56:01.240
 more time. I think there's. Especially

56:01.240 --> 56:02.840
 because we're growing so many areas. And

56:02.840 --> 56:05.320
 there's so many things to learn. So many

56:05.320 --> 56:08.360
 relationships to build. Time to spend

56:08.360 --> 56:09.880
 with a number of different technologies.

56:09.880 --> 56:13.480
 And. And. But I kind of reflect really

56:13.480 --> 56:15.400
 the size of the opportunity that exists

56:15.400 --> 56:17.320
 for Qualcomm. Qualcomm. It is really

56:17.320 --> 56:19.640
 growing in a number of different

56:19.640 --> 56:22.840
 directions. All at the same time. And

56:22.840 --> 56:27.240
 so it did got busier. And part of this

56:27.240 --> 56:29.800
 is because I'm spending a lot of time

56:29.800 --> 56:32.040
 understanding the new industries we're

56:32.040 --> 56:34.600
 going in and building

56:34.600 --> 56:36.520
 relationships. Second thing, which is a

56:36.520 --> 56:39.240
 lot to do with how I think about things

56:39.240 --> 56:41.640
 and a little bit of my personality. At

56:41.640 --> 56:43.720
 the end of the day, business

56:43.720 --> 56:47.400
 partnerships really done by people. And

56:47.400 --> 56:50.360
 I think the importance of having trusted

56:50.360 --> 56:53.800
 relationships for the long term is

56:53.800 --> 56:55.480
 extremely important. And I've been

56:55.480 --> 56:57.880
 dedicated to do that as CEO. We're not

56:57.880 --> 57:00.920
 a company that plays for the short term.

57:00.920 --> 57:03.080
 We don't. And when we build new

57:03.080 --> 57:05.240
 partnerships, we expect that to be for

57:05.240 --> 57:09.320
 decades. And so I spend time doing that.

57:09.320 --> 57:11.160
 And I think that's important for Qualcomm.

57:11.160 --> 57:15.560
 The other part of your question is we do

57:15.560 --> 57:17.960
 have a lot of opportunities in all

57:17.960 --> 57:20.200
 different areas. What we like

57:20.200 --> 57:22.120
 and I've been fortunate enough to become

57:22.120 --> 57:25.240
 CEO at a time that a lot of the trends

57:25.240 --> 57:27.400
 are pointing to our technology. We talk

57:27.400 --> 57:29.080
 about some of them. We talk about

57:29.080 --> 57:31.160
 merger of physical and digital spaces.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.840
 We talk about the transformation of the

57:32.840 --> 57:35.640
 automobile. We talk about the merge of

57:35.640 --> 57:39.400
 computing and mobile. The enterprise

57:39.400 --> 57:40.760
 transformation of the home. There are

57:40.760 --> 57:43.240
 many of those trends. And those trends

57:43.240 --> 57:48.120
 create opportunities for Qualcomm to be

57:48.120 --> 57:52.120
 providing technology first and as such

57:52.120 --> 57:54.440
 we're in a hurry. So I'm in a little bit

57:54.440 --> 57:55.960
 of a hurry because I think the

57:55.960 --> 57:58.520
 opportunity is incredible for technology

57:58.520 --> 58:02.520
 but having fun and enjoying the job.

58:02.520 --> 58:04.600
 Is there a burden because of so much

58:04.600 --> 58:08.440
 what you said is partnerships and

58:08.440 --> 58:10.120
 almost like friendships, connections

58:10.120 --> 58:12.600
 with other human beings. Me as an

58:12.600 --> 58:14.360
 introvert that has a lot of social

58:14.360 --> 58:16.520
 anxiety, that seems extremely

58:16.520 --> 58:18.520
 stressful. So is there that burden on

58:18.520 --> 58:20.200
 your shoulders? You have to wake up every

58:20.200 --> 58:24.520
 day and talk to friends you've had for

58:24.520 --> 58:27.000
 many years. It could be, you know, and

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
 then convince them and make

58:29.000 --> 58:32.040
 partnerships with them. Talk with them.

58:32.040 --> 58:34.280
 Describe to them the future. Sell them an

58:34.280 --> 58:36.440
 idea and then yourself grow because you

58:36.440 --> 58:37.720
 don't know what the heck the future is

58:37.720 --> 58:39.400
 going to be like. You have to project

58:39.400 --> 58:41.160
 both confidence and humility. All those

58:41.160 --> 58:45.000
 kinds of things. Is that exhausting?

58:45.000 --> 58:47.720
 It is exhausting but it's something I

58:47.720 --> 58:49.720
 do like to do and it's not only with

58:49.720 --> 58:52.040
 partners really. It's also internally to

58:52.040 --> 58:54.600
 your employees. I think to get alignment

58:54.600 --> 58:56.920
 on the vision and faith in the vision

58:56.920 --> 58:58.200
 and execute and at the end of the day

58:58.200 --> 58:59.400
 we're very fortunate. We have a lot of

58:59.400 --> 59:01.240
 smart people. So people when if they're

59:01.240 --> 59:02.440
 aligned with the vision they know what

59:02.440 --> 59:05.240
 to do and then of course as CEO you

59:05.240 --> 59:06.840
 have to convince your investors that

59:06.840 --> 59:09.800
 that's the right idea as well.

59:09.800 --> 59:13.800
 If you can put on your wise sage hat.

59:13.800 --> 59:16.200
 Do you have advice for young people in

59:16.200 --> 59:20.680
 high school and college? You yourself

59:20.680 --> 59:22.520
 started from the humble beginnings in

59:22.520 --> 59:27.000
 Brazil. Maybe a bit of a wild risky

59:27.000 --> 59:29.480
 decision to go to Japan and now are at

59:29.480 --> 59:30.920
 the head of one of the biggest, most

59:30.920 --> 59:32.760
 successful, most impactful companies in

59:32.760 --> 59:35.880
 the world. Given that story can you give

59:35.880 --> 59:39.160
 advice to young people today that you

59:39.160 --> 59:41.320
 know how they can have a career or just

59:41.320 --> 59:44.120
 the life they can be proud of? I think

59:44.120 --> 59:47.000
 the first thing and of course all

59:47.000 --> 59:49.800
 those answers are going to relate to

59:49.800 --> 59:52.920
 my own experience right. The first thing

59:52.920 --> 59:59.160
 is it always work for me to have a

59:59.160 --> 1:00:01.320
 plan. Even if the plan is just what I'm

1:00:01.320 --> 1:00:02.760
 going to do in the next two years but

1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:04.920
 what do I want to do? Where do I want to

1:00:04.920 --> 1:00:07.480
 go? I think it's

1:00:07.480 --> 1:00:09.080
 important for people especially young

1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:13.320
 people is to really

1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:15.240
 have a dream and go pursue it. I mean

1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:17.480
 have dreams not go back to bed to sleep

1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:20.040
 is really what do you want to

1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:21.320
 accomplish and then what it's going to

1:00:21.320 --> 1:00:23.480
 take to do that and then believe in

1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:26.360
 yourself. Like I said I joined

1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:30.040
 Qualcomm as an engineer and I didn't

1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:33.000
 have any plans when I joined to be CEO

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:34.920
 but I do want as an engineer what I

1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:37.640
 wanted to do, where I want to

1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:39.400
 contribute what I wanted to work on and

1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:42.440
 then and then keep evolving from that

1:00:42.440 --> 1:00:45.320
 point in time. The other thing is this

1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:47.640
 is an advice, it's more of like career

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:50.840
 advice that I got early in my

1:00:50.840 --> 1:00:53.880
 career was extremely helpful for me

1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:55.560
 and I will give that advice to everyone

1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:58.680
 that is interested.

1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:01.480
 Spend time understanding what are the

1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:02.760
 things you're good at and what are

1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:05.080
 things you're not. Like what is that

1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:07.800
 real border between your area of

1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:09.560
 competence and your area of

1:01:09.560 --> 1:01:12.520
 incompetence and once you see that once

1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:14.600
 you see that you know exactly what you

1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:16.840
 have to work on and you can say I can

1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:18.840
 if I did that's what I want to go next

1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:21.640
 this is the gap I need to do it and it's

1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:24.120
 it's faster when you can identify

1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:26.040
 yourself before other people can tell

1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:28.600
 you then it leads to

1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:31.960
 automatically the next step. Surround

1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:33.960
 yourself the people they're very good

1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:36.760
 the things that you're not.

1:01:36.760 --> 1:01:39.160
 So yes you're radically honest about the

1:01:39.160 --> 1:01:41.400
 things that you're not good at but

1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:43.080
 given what you're passionate about you

1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:44.840
 need to get good at or you would like to

1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:46.600
 get good at and surround yourself by

1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:48.840
 those people. How often did the plans you

1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:51.000
 make actually work out? You said it's

1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000
 important to make plans you didn't say

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.720
 anything about it's important to execute

1:01:55.720 --> 1:01:58.440
 on those plans. More than 50% success rate.

1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:01.720
 Try to keep it above 50.

1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:03.960
 What was the whole why did you end up in

1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:06.520
 Japan? You know I've been fortunate

1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:09.400
 enough to work in cellular and wireless

1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:12.120
 my entire career so I I always like

1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:14.600
 communications. When I enter engineering

1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:17.160
 school my dad was electrical engineer

1:02:17.160 --> 1:02:19.000
 but he worked with the utility company

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.200
 he wanted to

1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:22.520
 me to graduate in traditional electrical

1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:24.840
 engineering like energy generation

1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:27.400
 distribution

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:29.320
 and but I like electronics communication

1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:32.840
 so I end up doing both and

1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:35.320
 and I always like communication was

1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:37.240
 fascinated by wireless communication so

1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:38.840
 my first job at a college is start

1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:40.440
 working for a Japanese company down in

1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:41.400
 Brazil

1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:44.360
 was NEC and within about a year in they

1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:45.960
 transferred me to

1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:47.960
 Tokyo asked me to go to the headquarters

1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:48.760
 and

1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:51.320
 it was the first time I left Brazil and a

1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:53.320
 little bit different from Brazil

1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:56.040
 culturally different is in the other

1:02:56.040 --> 1:02:58.040
 side of the planet

1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:00.760
 and and that's how it started you said

1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:03.720
 your father's an electrical engineer

1:03:03.720 --> 1:03:05.800
 do you think what you're doing now

1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:08.200
 makes your father proud I think he's very

1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:09.720
 proud I think

1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:12.440
 especially you know

1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:15.080
 he tells me that you know I'm still the

1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:17.320
 same person never change and

1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:19.000
 does he still does he give you advice

1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:20.680
 does he criticize what you're doing

1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:22.680
 tell you how to improve my my mom and

1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:24.200
 that's to give me advice today I'm very

1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:28.840
 fortunate for that but

1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:30.680
 he's proud also proud because there are

1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:33.560
 very few Brazilians

1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:35.560
 that have you know achieve a position as

1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:37.320
 CEO of

1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:39.720
 of a company in size of Qualcomm and I

1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:42.440
 and I do know that that also I carry a

1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:43.720
 burden I

1:03:43.720 --> 1:03:46.600
 you know I especially for the Latino

1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:47.560
 community

1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:49.640
 to be an inspiration for them and make

1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:51.800
 sure I set a good example

1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:55.240
 so not just your your mom and dad but

1:03:55.240 --> 1:03:58.760
 the culture the people that were

1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:01.400
 originally your home

1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:04.680
 do you uh you know life is finite

1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:07.720
 do you think about your own mortality

1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:11.880
 look I'm a I'm a devout Christian and

1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:15.320
 so I'm a big believer that there's

1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:19.400
 this is just a transition and but

1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:20.680
 don't spend a lot of time thinking

1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:22.040
 about that I'm

1:04:22.040 --> 1:04:25.640
 I am somebody good better and different

1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:26.440
 that

1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:28.680
 try as much as possible to leave the

1:04:28.680 --> 1:04:31.480
 present and that's what I do

1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:33.320
 and try to make the present better on

1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:34.040
 this

1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:35.720
 on this place here on earth absolutely

1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:37.240
 absolutely and that some of these

1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:39.000
 technologies some of these ideas are

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.040
 kind of

1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:42.360
 a different kind of immortality as well

1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:43.000
 because they

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.680
 they propagate through time and have

1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:46.520
 impact on people

1:04:46.520 --> 1:04:48.680
 in the best possible way so technology

1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:49.720
 can be scary can

1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:51.560
 technology can be destructive but it

1:04:51.560 --> 1:04:53.480
 seems like in the end

1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:56.360
 it can be it can do a lot of good

1:04:56.360 --> 1:04:59.080
 more good there's more good than bad

1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:00.120
 what do you think is the meaning of

1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:01.720
 this whole thing I asked you about

1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:03.480
 aliens observing us

1:05:03.480 --> 1:05:06.360
 what what's the meaning of life

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:07.720
 Christiano

1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:09.480
 what's the meaning of life

1:05:09.480 --> 1:05:10.760
 easy questions

1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:13.000
 that's not an easy question at all uh

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:14.360
 I think that's uh

1:05:14.360 --> 1:05:15.800
 that's a question at least for me you

1:05:15.800 --> 1:05:17.480
 have to answer individually

1:05:17.480 --> 1:05:20.920
 uh but uh I do believe we're all here

1:05:20.920 --> 1:05:22.200
 for purpose

1:05:22.200 --> 1:05:23.240
 you know I

1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:25.880
 I you know in my prayers I always ask

1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:26.680
 that

1:05:26.680 --> 1:05:29.400
 you know I I stay on track whatever my

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:30.840
 purpose is

1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:33.000
 but I do believe we're here for purpose

1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:34.680
 and we need to do the best we can

1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:36.760
 during the time we have on this earth

1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:37.720
 so that means

1:05:38.520 --> 1:05:40.840
 create beautiful things for you

1:05:40.840 --> 1:05:43.000
 as an engineer yes and and create

1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:44.520
 beautiful things yes

1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:45.320
 what about love

1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:47.960
 what's the role of love in the human

1:05:47.960 --> 1:05:49.720
 condition

1:05:49.720 --> 1:05:52.040
 love's very important and uh it's an

1:05:52.040 --> 1:05:54.680
 essential part of uh being human

1:05:54.680 --> 1:05:56.120
 it comes in the package

1:05:56.840 --> 1:05:58.920
 and uh I think if you look at the

1:05:58.920 --> 1:05:59.960
 situation

1:05:59.960 --> 1:06:02.360
 what's happening right now I think uh

1:06:02.360 --> 1:06:03.960
 you look at the situation with some of

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:05.480
 the underprivileged uh

1:06:05.480 --> 1:06:07.000
 communities you look at the harmless

1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:08.040
 situation

1:06:08.040 --> 1:06:09.160
 I think we all need more love

1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:11.560
 yeah and I think people that build

1:06:11.560 --> 1:06:13.480
 incredible technology sometimes forget

1:06:13.480 --> 1:06:15.240
 the love part like those are

1:06:15.240 --> 1:06:16.360
 all it's all integrated

1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:19.880
 there's no thinking about humanity

1:06:20.520 --> 1:06:22.360
 is really important when you build

1:06:22.360 --> 1:06:24.840
 tools that empower that humanity

1:06:24.840 --> 1:06:26.440
 because there's I think I at least

1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:28.120
 that person I believe we're all capable

1:06:28.120 --> 1:06:29.480
 of both evil and good

1:06:30.040 --> 1:06:32.520
 and we have to build technology build

1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:34.440
 societies build governments build

1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:37.400
 communities that um inspires to

1:06:38.280 --> 1:06:40.200
 to connect with the good part within

1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:40.840
 all of us

1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:43.160
 I'm a big believer that technology is

1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:44.680
 at the end the force for good

1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:46.120
 and if just look

1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:48.200
 if you just look you know not trying to

1:06:48.760 --> 1:06:51.160
 move away from a deep discussion to a

1:06:51.160 --> 1:06:54.120
 more uh specific technical one

1:06:54.120 --> 1:06:56.840
 but if we start the conversation

1:06:56.840 --> 1:06:57.960
 talk about smartphones

1:06:58.600 --> 1:07:02.440
 and uh smartphones really the first time

1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:04.600
 that you could say that everybody in

1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:06.440
 the world was able to connect to the

1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:07.880
 internet and connect to each other

1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:10.360
 and I think what uh that empowerment

1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:11.320
 that that provided

1:07:11.320 --> 1:07:13.000
 it's an incredible force for good

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:16.760
 well the company you lead

1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:18.600
 the the technology you've created

1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:20.840
 one of them that I'm especially excited

1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:22.280
 about which is snapdragon the whole

1:07:22.280 --> 1:07:23.800
 line of processors there

1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:25.880
 currently I would say at about 10

1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:26.840
 billion transistors

1:07:27.400 --> 1:07:29.080
 if you think about the human brain

1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:30.680
 it's about a hundred billion neurons

1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:33.400
 so I think uh 11

1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:36.760
 samsung galaxy 22s s22s are already

1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:37.720
 smarter than me

1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:40.040
 and that's being nice uh to me

1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:42.360
 I'm really honored to use but you're

1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:43.800
 extremely valuable time with me

1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:45.880
 even though you said Pillai is the

1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:46.680
 favorite player

1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:49.160
 beyond all of that

1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:51.320
 I think you're an incredible person

1:07:51.320 --> 1:07:52.280
 incredible leader

1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:54.440
 and you lead an incredible engineering

1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:55.880
 company so thank you for doing that

1:07:55.880 --> 1:07:56.680
 oh thank you so much

1:07:56.680 --> 1:07:57.960
 thank you for the kind words

1:07:57.960 --> 1:07:59.240
 really a pleasure having this

1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:00.760
 conversation I really had a lot of fun

1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:01.320
 doing it

1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:03.160
 and uh thank you for having me in your

1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:03.720
 podcast

1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:05.720
 thanks for listening to this

1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:07.880
 conversation with Christiana Oman

1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:09.000
 to support this podcast

1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:10.600
 please check out our sponsors in the

1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:11.720
 description

1:08:11.720 --> 1:08:13.400
 and now let me leave you with some

1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:14.840
 words from Stephen Hawking

1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:17.000
 for millions of years

1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:19.720
 mankind lived just like the animals

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:21.640
 then something happened

1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:23.160
 which unleashed the power of our

1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:23.880
 imagination

1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:25.960
 we learned to talk

1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:27.000
 and we learned to listen

1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:30.040
 speech has allowed the communication

1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:30.680
 of ideas

1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:33.320
 enabling human beings to work together

1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:34.520
 to build the impossible

1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:37.480
 mankind's greatest achievements

1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:39.400
 have come about by talking

1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:42.840
 and its greatest failures by not talking

1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:45.960
 it doesn't have to be like this

1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:47.320
 our greatest hopes could become

1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:48.440
 reality in the future

1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:51.080
 with the technology at our disposal

1:08:51.080 --> 1:08:53.560
 the possibilities are unbounded

1:08:54.120 --> 1:08:57.000
 all we need to do is make sure we keep

1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:57.400
 talking

1:08:58.280 --> 1:08:59.320
 thank you for listening

1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:09.800
 and hope to see you next time
